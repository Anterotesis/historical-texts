<HEAD>THE SPEECH, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Gentlemen of the</HI> GRAND-JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is with Plea&s;ure I &s;ee, at this time, a Grand-Jury that I am convinced do not re|quire much to be &s;aid to them, to in&s;truct them in their Duty, or the Occa&s;ion of their being called here: However, Cu&s;tom makes it ne|ce&s;&s;ary that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid to you from the Bench: I hope therefore you will give me your Patience, if, in&s;tead of confining my&s;elf to Sub|jects that relate more immediately to your Office as a Grand Jury, I take up &s;ome Part of your Time in treating of a Mat|ter of more general U&s;e, and of the greate&s;t Importance to the Publick Safety; the LAWFULNESS OF DEFENCE again&s;t an armed Enemy.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, at fir&s;t View, &s;eem &s;trange that there &s;hould be any Occa&s;ion to prove a Thing in its own Nature &s;o evident: But whoever reflects, that this very Point has taken up a con&s;iderable Part of the publick Debates in a neighbouring Government; to which we are nearly related, and what a Number of Abettors the A&s;&s;ertors of the Unlawfulne&s;s of all kind of Defence have &s;ound, will be le&s;s &s;urprized at it. For my own Part, I look upon this Doctrine not only to be with|out Warrant or Colour, either from Rea&s;on or Revelation; but in its Con&s;equences pernicious to Society, and intirely in|con&s;i&s;tent with, and de&s;tructive of all civil Government. But as Opinions, otherwi&s;e than as they are &s;upported by Rea&s;on, ought to be but of little Authority; I will endeavour to di&s;cu&s;s this Point fairly, and to &s;et the Matter in a true Light. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By &s;hewing how the Ca&s;e &s;tood under the Law of Nature.
<PB N="4" REF="004708_0003_100DC0C150F97D50">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That no Religion what&s;oever, founded upon any pre|tended &s;upernatural Revelation of the Will of GOD, can be true, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with or repugnant to the Law of Nature: And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I propo&s;e to examine &s;ome of the principal Au|thorities from Holy Writ, which the Patrons and A&s;&s;ertors of the Unlawfulne&s;s of Defence, under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation, have adduced to prove their Point; and to &s;hew that the&s;e Authorities are &s;o far from &s;upporting their Doctrine, that they are either quite foreign to the Ca&s;e, or that they militate directly again&s;t the Adducers of them.</P>
<P>SOME Men of great Learning and Knowledge have amu&s;ed them&s;elves and the World, with endeavouring to di&s;cover what great End the Supream Being propo&s;ed to him&s;elf in the Creation of the World, and of Mankind in particular; and have formed various Conjectures about it. Certain, however, it is, that an Addition to His own Happine&s;s could not be the Motive; becau&s;e He mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been infinitely happy from all Eternity. And it is no le&s;s certain, that &s;uch a Being, as we all under&s;tand GOD to be, a Being of infinite Goodne&s;s and Benevolence, could not po&s;&s;ibly intend the Mi&s;ery and Unhappine&s;s of a Number of rational Creatures, by him|&s;elf to be brought into Exi&s;tence out of nothing: On the con|trary, no other End than the Happine&s;s of Mankind in their Creation, can con&s;i&s;t with the natural Notions we entertain of GOD. If then it be admitted, that GOD created them with a View to their own Happine&s;s, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that he afforded them the Means of acquiring &s;uch a Degree of it as he intended them, and as was &s;uitable to their Circum&s;tances in the World wherein he had placed them. Accordingly, we find the great Author of our Being has &s;o fa&s;hioned and contrived us, that a De&s;ire of Happine&s;s, which is of &s;o much Importance to us and the End of our Creation, is made the very fir&s;t Principle, or Law of our Natures. And it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that in a State of Nature the fir&s;t Things upon which Men ca&s;t their Thoughts, were the procuring Food to &s;atisfy the Cravings of Appetite, Raiment and Hou&s;es to &s;helter them from the Injury and Inclemency of the Sea&s;ons, with &s;uch other Conveniences of Life as concerned their immediate Pre&s;ervation and Comfort. But, alas! Experience mu&s;t very &s;oon have taught them, that the&s;e Things were va&s;tly in&s;ufficient for their com|pleat Happine&s;s; and that, were they to &s;top there, they would fall infinitely &s;hort of the End. Life and Liberty, the imme|diate Gifts of GOD, were common to all Men; and every Man had a natural Title to an uncontrouled Enjoyment of them, and, con&s;equently, a Right to pre&s;erve and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end them
<PB N="5" REF="004708_0004_100DC0C2D6BDBF30">
from the Injuries and Attempts of others, as they concern'd his Happine&s;s: And what is called E&s;tate, or Property, was as ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to humane Happine&s;s as even Life or Liberty; and therefore &s;ome Means of &s;ecuring and pre&s;erving Life and Liberty, and what every Individual had purcha&s;ed and made his own, by his Labour and Sweat of his Brows, were in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. If, indeed, all Men, from the Beginning, had acted up to the genuine Law of Nature, and had done what was perfectly right, all other Provi&s;ions or Laws would have been u&s;ele&s;s. But in&s;tead of this, in the Order of Time, a Spirit of Rapaciou&s;ne&s;s and Corruption appeared in the World; and &s;ome, by a fatal Mi&s;take, endeavoured to find their own private Advantages and Happine&s;s, by making a Prey of the Lives, Liberties and Properties of others, by Violence and a &s;trong Hand. And it is more than probable, that Men in a State of Nature, before they had incorporated them&s;elves into political Societies, mu&s;t have &s;uffered much, as the more Inno|cent and Weak were expo&s;ed to the In&s;ults and Inva&s;ions of the more rapacious and &s;trong; and more e&s;pecially, as it was no ea&s;y Matter for intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, de&s;titute of any other Rule than Moral Rectitude for the Determining Right and Wrong, to decide Di&s;putes about Property and Juri&s;diction. The na|tural De&s;ire then of Happine&s;s, and that Principle of Self-Pre|&s;ervation, common to all Men, mu&s;t fir&s;t have in&s;pired them, for their common Protection and Safety, with Notions of Compacts, of Laws, and of Government, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and with|out which it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to be happy in any Degree.</P>
<P>NOW the Difference between Men in a State of Nature, and their being incorporated into political Societies, con&s;i&s;ts in this: That in a State of Nature there being no common Judge to whom Men could appeal, every Man had a Right to judge of and to puni&s;h Offences committed again&s;t him, according as the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Facts, in his Opinion, de&s;erv'd: But in the other Ca&s;e, having given up that natural Right of private Judgment into the Hands of the Community, he re&s;orts to the Community, when he thinks he is injured, as to a common Judge or Umpire, and &s;ubmits his Cau&s;e to be determined by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rules of the Society for deciding Controver&s;ies between the Members of it, indifferently. But Societies them|&s;elves, with regard to one another, having no common Judge between them to whom they can appeal, may be properly &s;aid to be in a State of Nature, and to retain that Right of private Judgment, that every &s;ingle Man naturally had, to repel and puni&s;h Injuries committed again&s;t them. And it would be exceedingly ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e, that a Number of Men,
<PB N="6" REF="004708_0005_100DC0C50ADFE3C8">
formed and united into a political Society for their common Safety and Happine&s;s, &s;hould thereby lo&s;e any Part of that na|tural Right, of pre&s;erving and defending them&s;elves from a fo|reign Enemy, that every Individual had before &s;uch Union.</P>
<P>IF then Men mu&s;t have been mi&s;erable without the Aid of Government and civil Society; the Pre&s;ervation and Defence of that Government or Society mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been right by the Law of Nature, and con&s;equently agreeable to the Will of GOD, who was the Author of that Law, and had given Men no other general Rule. Let us then con&s;ider in what Manner any political Society can po&s;&s;ibly be affected, &s;o as to make any kind of Defence nece&s;&s;ary for its Pre&s;ervation. And it cannot po&s;&s;ibly happen but one of the&s;e two Ways, <HI>to wit,</HI> either from &s;ome of the Members of the Society con|&s;piring again&s;t it, and acting contrary to the Laws and funda|mental Con&s;titution of it; or from &s;ome foreign Enemy, by Force of Arms. It will be rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> yielded, by tho&s;e that oppo&s;e the Lawfulne&s;s of Arms, that R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Traitors ought to be puni&s;hed according to the utmo&s;t R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gour of the Laws they violate, becau&s;e they them&s;elves are Parties to tho&s;e Laws, and bound to the Ob&s;ervance of them by their own Compacts. But what is to be done in ca&s;e of a foreign Enemy, &s;eeing here is no Compact? I know of no Alternative, but the Relying upon Prayers and Tears, or re&s;i&s;ting by Force. And if the Aid of Prayers and Tears may be relied on in &s;uch Ca&s;es, they may be depended on again&s;t Rebels and Traitors, and in all other Ca&s;es, and con&s;equently all Government is u&s;ele&s;s. But the U&s;efulne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of Government has been already &s;hewn, as al&s;o the Right of pre&s;erving it: And if Force is at all nece&s;&s;ary or lawful, no Medium can po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;igned between the lea&s;t and the greate&s;t Degree of it; and there is no Way to re&s;i&s;t an Army but by an Army, nor to repel Force but by Force. I believe it will hardly be in&s;i&s;ted on, that an Indictment again&s;t the General and Principal Officers of an invading Army, would be any Security at all; and any Attempt of that Sort would &s;erve only to be laugh'd at, and to be a &s;tanding Je&s;t among&s;t the Re&s;t of Mankind. If then Govern|ment is e&s;&s;ential to human Happine&s;s, as has been &s;een; if the Pre&s;ervation of Government is equally e&s;&s;ential; and if Force is nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of Government; it very clearly follows, that War was lawful by the Law of Nature; becau&s;e if it were otherwi&s;e, Men would be denied the Liberty of u&s;ing the Means nece&s;&s;ary to that Happine&s;s which GOD de&s;igned them, and which was the End of their Creation; which would be ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004708_0006_100DC0C86FF52920">AS I have mentioned the <HI>Law of Nature</HI> to you, and have propo&s;ed to &s;hew, that no Religion, founded upon any pretended &s;upernatural Revelation of GOD's Will, can be true, that is repugnant to the Law of Nature; it will be proper to explain to you what I mean by it. By the Law of Nature then, is meant the Law of Rea&s;on, or in other Words, it is &s;uch a Rule for the Doing what is fit and proper for rational Crea|tures to do as they are capable of di&s;covering by the right U&s;e of their natural Faculties, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;upernatural Revelation. This Law of Rea&s;on is the general Law of our Natures, and claims GOD for its Author; and therefore may, with the greate&s;t Truth and Propriety, be called the Law of GOD Him|&s;elf. And as GOD is infinitely wi&s;e and good, it would be down|right Bla&s;phemy to &s;ay, or to &s;uppo&s;e, that he would give Men a Rule for their Conduct that was not adequate to the End for which he gave it; or that a Conformity of human Actions to this general Law of GOD, would not ju&s;tify Men in his Sight; and much more to &s;ay, it would di&s;plea&s;e him. What&s;oever therefore was right, what&s;oever was fit, what&s;oever was lawful for Men to do, in order to procure Happine&s;s, under the Law of Nature, mu&s;t have been eternally &s;o, as being founded in the very Nature and Rea&s;on of Things: And what&s;oever is right, fit and lawful from the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily continue to be right, fit and lawful to all Eternity. GOD is the &s;ame to Day, Ye&s;terday and forever: In him is no Change or Variablene&s;s at all; but his Ways are con&s;tant and uniform. Hence it mo&s;t evidently follows, that any Re|ligion, or any Part of a Religion, that is pretended to be built upon a &s;upernatural Di&s;covery of GOD's Will, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be true, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with, or repugnant to the primary Law of GOD, or Law of Nature, which is the &s;ame Thing; becau&s;e it would imply Imperfection, Change and Variablene&s;s in GOD, which are contrary to his very Nature. For In|&s;tance; the Practice of Morality is of eternal Obligation; and Part of the Law of Nature, and is &s;o ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to Man's Happine&s;s, that without it he cannot po&s;&s;ibly be happy in any Degree: Ju&s;tice, Benevolence and Gratitude are moral Virtues: Now, &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that any Per&s;on having a Power, or appearing to have Power, to work the mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous Miracles, &s;hould pretend an Authority from GOD to teach Mankind, that the Exerci&s;e of Ju&s;tice, Benevolence and Gratitude was wrong and di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD; would &s;uch a Per&s;on de&s;erve any Credit? And would not all wi&s;e and good Men conclude him to be either a Devil or an Impo&s;tor? Surely the would! And the Rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e &s;uch Doctrine is diametrically oppo&s;ite to right Rea&s;on, and contrary to our
<PB N="8" REF="004708_0007_100DC0C9F61CC880">
natural Notions of GOD. Now as Government and political Society have been clearly &s;hewn, from the very Nature and Rea&s;on of Things, to be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to human Happi|ne&s;s; that the Pre&s;ervation of Society is no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential; and that Force is requi&s;ite to that Pre&s;ervation; If any Man, or even an Angel from Heaven, &s;hould pretend an Authority from GOD to pronounce all kind of Defence to be unlawful, he ought to be rejected as a Liar and an Impo&s;tor. Tho&s;e there|fore that pretend to make out from the Bible, that War, in every Shape, is forbidden under the Go&s;pel-Di&s;pen&s;ation, will infallibly prove the Bible it&s;elf to be wrong, or them&s;elves to be very wrong Interpreters of it.</P>
<P>LET none, from this Manner of &s;peaking, imagine that I intend to in&s;inuate any thing to the Prejudice or Di&s;credit of the &s;acred Writings, or to ca&s;t any Imputations upon the Bible: Far, very far, be that from my Thoughts. On the contrary, though I do in&s;i&s;t that the Bible would be no Warrant, nor ought to be of any Authority to &s;up|port a Doctrine incon&s;i&s;tent with human Happine&s;s, by prohibiting the nece&s;&s;ary Means leading to it; yet, I do like|wi&s;e a&s;&s;ert, that it cannot ju&s;tly be impeached with any thing of this Nature. And I hope I &s;hall be able clearly to make out, to your Satisfaction, that there is not the lea&s;t Colour of Authority from the Scriptures, to prove that a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary War is forbidden to Chri&s;tians; but that tho&s;e Texts of Scrip|ture that are commonly made u&s;e of by tho&s;e who deny the Lawfulne&s;s of Self-Defence to Chri&s;tians, are either mi&s;under|&s;tood or gro&s;ly perverted by them. It would detain you too long, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> were I to examine and con&s;ider all the Parts of Scripture that have been frequently cited upon this Occa&s;ion. I &s;hall therefore &s;elect &s;ome of the principal Texts that I find quoted by an Author of very great Note <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barclay.</NOTE> and &s;ome others on the &s;ame Side of the Que&s;tion, and endeavour to &s;hew that they carry no &s;uch Interpretation as the&s;e People pretend.</P>
<P>THOSE Parts of Scripture that are alledged as Authorities in this Ca&s;e, are &s;aid to be either Prophe&s;ies, importing an en|tire Ce&s;&s;ation of War under the Go&s;pel; po&s;itive Precepts, forbidding the U&s;e of the Sword to Chri&s;tians; or general Precepts, that prove War to be incompatible with Chri&s;tianity, and oppo&s;ite to the Temper and Spirit of the Go&s;pel. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the famous Prophe&s;ies in the Books of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Micah</HI> are con&s;tantly cited, and great Stre&s;s has been laid thereon. In order therefore to the clear Under&s;tanding this Prophe&s;y, I
<PB N="9" REF="004708_0008_100DC0CB8126CCC0">
will trouble you with the Pa&s;&s;age at large, which runs thus: <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in the la&s;t Days, that the Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Top of the Mountains&punc; and &s;hall be exalted above the Hills; And all Nations &s;hall flow unto it. And many People &s;hall go and &s;ay, Come ye and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Hou&s;e of the God of</HI> Jacob, <HI>and he will teach us of his Way, and we will walk in his Paths; for out of</HI> Zion <HI>&s;hall go forth the Law; and the Word of the Lord from</HI> Jeru&s;alem. <HI>And he &s;hall judge among the Nations and &s;hall rebuke many People: And they &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow-&s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks; Nation &s;hall not lift up Sword again&s;t Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more. Oh Hou&s;e of</HI> Jacob <HI>come ye and let us walk in the Light of the Lord.</HI> Happy, happy, oh happy indeed will the World be in the ble&s;&s;ed Accompli&s;hment of this Prophe&s;y! The true and genuine Con&s;truction of this Pa&s;&s;age appears ma|nife&s;tly to be, That in the latter Ages of the World, or in the Fulne&s;s of the Go&s;pel-Times, all Nations &s;hall &s;o univer&s;ally adhere to the Law of GOD, that Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the Earth; every Man &s;hall do what is right and ju&s;t; none &s;hall injure or violate the Right of his Brother, his Neigh|bour, or his Friend; and in Con&s;equence of this, War will naturally cea&s;e and be aboli&s;hed, as the Effect will naturally vani&s;h when the Cau&s;e is taken away; Swords, Spears, and other warlike Implements will become u&s;ele&s;s Lumber, or in the Language of the Prophet, may be converted into Plow-Shares, and other Implements of Hu&s;bandry. Now as no Man can pretend that the Prophe&s;y in this Sen&s;e is yet accompli&s;hed, but that the&s;e happy Days, this glorious Reformation is yet to be expected in GOD's due time, it is certainly a mo&s;t unnatu|ral Conclu&s;ion, to infer, that War, which was lawful in order to repel lawle&s;s Force, &s;hall become unlawful before lawle&s;s Force is eradicated and extingui&s;hed from among&s;t Men. Let us, for Illu&s;tration of this Matter, &s;uppo&s;e the Prophets to have &s;aid, That in the Fulne&s;s of the Go&s;pel-Times the Earth &s;hall &s;pon|taneou&s;ly pour forth her Increa&s;e; Corn, Wine and Oil &s;hall flow without the Hand of the Labourer; Plow-&s;hares and Pruning-hooks &s;hall then become u&s;ele&s;s; Labour and Toil, the &s;ad Effects of the Fall of Man, &s;hall utterly cea&s;e and be no more. Would not that Man, who in the Expectation of the Accompli&s;hment of &s;uch a Prophe&s;y, &s;hould neglect to cultivate and &s;ow his Field, or to prune his Vineyard, before the promi|&s;ed Time, be in Danger of Starving? And might he not ju&s;tly be reputed mad by the re&s;t of Mankind? And yet upon no better Foundation do they build, who affirm the Unlawfulne&s;s of War, upon the Authority of the before-cited Prophe&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004708_0009_100DC0CD8E1623E0">THE noted Writer before-mentioned urges again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of War, <Q>That CHRIST &s;aid his Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore that his Servants &s;hall not fight:</Q> Prepo&s;terou&s;ly inferring, that becau&s;e CHRIST would not permit his Di&s;ciples to fight in a Ca&s;e wherein Fighting would have been quite improper, that therefore tho&s;e that fight in any Ca&s;e are not the Di&s;ciples or Servants of CHRIST. I have wonder'd to find the Place here alluded to, &s;o mon|&s;trou&s;ly tortured and perverted by this Author, and others, contrary to the expre&s;s Sen&s;e and Meaning of it! Our Saviour being que&s;tioned by <HI>Pilate</HI> concerning his being King of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and of the Offence he had been guilty of towards the <HI>Jews,</HI> by whom he &s;tood accu&s;ed, and who had delivered him unto <HI>Pilate,</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World: If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight that I &s;hould not be delivered to the</HI> Jews: <HI>But now is my Kingdom not from hence.</HI> The De&s;ign of this Decalaration &s;eems to be in order to undeceive the <HI>Jews,</HI> who entertained gro&s;s and partial Conceptions about the End of CHRIST's Coming; and be|liev'd it was to e&s;tabli&s;h an outward Kingdom at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and to re&s;tore the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But this was not the Ca&s;e. He came to erect a &s;piritual Kingdom to be &s;et up in the Hearts of Men, there to bear Rule and Government, to reform a cor|rupt World, and re&s;tore Men to their primitive Natures. Here Rea&s;on, Per&s;ua&s;ion, and &s;uch Things as tend to convict the Judgment and inlighten the Under&s;tanding, were the pro|per Means, were the only ones u&s;ed by him. Force would have been ab&s;olutely improper, and therefore is di&s;claimed by him. But he is &s;o far from condemning Force, in all Ca&s;es, that he expre&s;ly tells <HI>Pilate,</HI> that were his Kingdom of this World, then &s;hould his Servants fight in Defence of his Per&s;on. As if he had &s;aid, Were my Kingdom a temporal Kingdom, to the Pre&s;ervation of which Fighting is not only lawful but nece&s;&s;ary, my Servants would then have done their Duty, and have fought for me, as the Servants of other temporal Princes do in the like Ca&s;es.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="004708_0010_100DC0D1A840BFA0">
or &s;piritual: The Apo&s;tle, who figuratively was a Soldier in CHRIST's Cau&s;e, decides the Que&s;tion, and declares <HI>the Weapons were &s;piritual and not carnal</HI>; Ergo, quoth our Author, the U&s;e of carnal Weapons are unlawful to Chri&s;tians. Is this a fair Conclu&s;ion? It is, no doubt, unlawful to propagate Re|ligion by the Sword; but, &s;urely, that does not render the U&s;e of the Sword unlawful in all Ca&s;es. It is &s;omewhere &s;aid, the &s;ame Apo&s;tle was a Tent-maker, and if it had been added, that he was not a Shoemaker; the Conclu&s;ion that therefore Shoemaking was unlawful, would be equally ju&s;t, as to infer, that becau&s;e carnal Weapons were not u&s;ed by Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts in a Ca&s;e wherein they could have been of no Service, that therefore it is unlawful to u&s;e them in any Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> te&s;tifies, <HI>That Wars and Strifes come from the Lu&s;ts which war in the Members of carnal Men:</HI> But, &s;ays our Author, <Q>true Chri&s;tians have crucified the Fle&s;h with its Affections and Lu&s;ts:</Q> Therefore War is unlawful. How does this Conclu&s;ion follow from the Premi&s;es? Every kind of Wickedne&s;s proceeds from the &s;ame Cau&s;e here a&s;&s;igned by the Apo&s;tle for Wars and Strifes: Does it therefore follow that no Sort of Wickedne&s;s is to be re&s;i&s;ted or puni&s;hed? If &s;o, we may &s;hake Hands with all Government: Trea&s;ons, Murders, Rapes, and every other Crime, &s;hall go unpuni&s;hed, &s;eeing they all come from the Lu&s;ts that war in the Members of carnal Men. It is not denied but War is a very bad Thing, and brings dreadful Con&s;equences along with it. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Law-Suits. But does it therefore follow that an un|ju&s;t Inva&s;ion of our Country, by foreign Enemies, is not to be oppo&s;ed or re&s;i&s;ted; or that we are not to conte&s;t an unju&s;t Claim &s;et up again&s;t our E&s;tates. In either Ca&s;e, one Side mu&s;t be wrong; and it is the Agre&s;&s;or, the Wrong-Doer, that is chargeable with the Con&s;equences, and not tho&s;e who inno|cently and rightfully defend their Lives or their Properties. And I &s;hould be glad to learn from &s;uch as infer the Unlaw|fulne&s;s of War from this Text, how any other Strife comes to be lawful; and in particular, how they will ju&s;tify going to Law upon any Pretence what&s;oever; for &s;urely it will not be contended, that going to Law is not Strife.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>That we fight not with Fle&s;h and Blood:</HI> But, &s;ays our Author, <Q>outward War is accord|ing to the Fle&s;h, and again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood: Therefore War is noways lawful to Chri&s;tians.</Q> But how fairly is this Con&s;equence drawn? Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was a Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t, im|ployed to &s;pread and propagate the Go&s;pel; Preaching was his
<PB N="12" REF="004708_0011_100ECBB176518098">
Profe&s;&s;ion, not War. This being the real Fact, the Apo&s;tle mentions it as &s;uch. And if he had &s;aid, <HI>we di&s;pute not about Men's Properties or E&s;tates,</HI> which was likewi&s;e true, he would thereby as much have condemn'd the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Law, as he does, in this Place, the Unlawfulne&s;s of War.</P>
<P>BUT, it is &s;aid, we are commanded not to re&s;i&s;t Evil, <HI>but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite thee on the one Cheek, to turn the other: And if any Man &s;ue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, give him thy Cloak al&s;o,</HI> &amp;c. Now the&s;e Words are either to be taken in a re&s;trained and qualified Sen&s;e, or in a literal and unqualified Sen&s;e. Let the Advocates for the Unlawfulne&s;s of War, upon this Authority, take them either way, and they will find them&s;elves hooked into a Dilemma. If the Words be taken in a qualified Sen&s;e, they will not prove the Point contended for: And taken the other Way, they will prove too much; for not only War becomes unlawful, but going to Law in Defence of Property, and all Puni&s;hment of Criminals, will be likewi&s;e unlawful, which is contrary to their avowed Principles and Practices. For it can never be pretended, that the Hanging a Thief or a Murderer is not re&s;i&s;ting of Evil; or, that he that pro&s;ecutes another at the Law, for an unju&s;t Violence committed again&s;t his Per&s;on or E&s;tate, conforms to the literal Sen&s;e of the Text. The Truth is, that the Words cited, with all that follow to the End of the Chapter, were &s;poken by CHRIST to his Di&s;ciples only, and &s;eem to be in|tended as Rules to them, for their Conduct and Behaviour, in the Di&s;charge of their Mini&s;try, in order to convert Men to Chri&s;tianity. But if we admit that they were intended as Le&s;&s;ons to Chri&s;tians in general, they can import no more than that it is not lawful to revenge Injuries, and that, in many Ca&s;es, it is better patiently to bear &s;ome Injuries than to &s;eek Redre&s;s and Satisfaction by returning them.</P>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the Abilities of the Author &s;o often quoted, and how great a Ma&s;ter of Rea&s;on he appears to be when he has Rea&s;on on his Side; and compare therewith his Manner of Defending the Po&s;ition, <Q>That War is unlawful to Chri&s;tians&punc;</Q> I confe&s;s, I am tempted to call his Sincerity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Que&s;tion. His Inferences and Conclu&s;ions are certainly un|worthy his great Parts. And his con&s;tantly Coupling Revenge and War together, as if they were convertible Terms, &s;eems to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a Piece of Craft, calculated to deceive and mi&s;lead the Un|wary. No Chri&s;tian, I believe, ever doubted that Revenge was unlawful to Chri&s;tians: but how will it be made out that there can be no War without Revenge? As well may it be
<PB N="13" REF="004708_0012_100ECBAE2F439FE8">
&s;aid, that putting a Malefactor to Death is Revenge, as that Killing Men, in Defence of our Lives, is &s;o. Nay, it looks more like Revenge to put a Man to Death in cool Blood, after the Fact, than to kill him in the Attempt, in order to prevent him.
<Q>CHRIST, &s;aith our Author, the Prince of Peace, hath expre&s;sly prohibited his Children all Violence.</Q>
Could this Man be ignorant that the Violence here prohibited is an unju&s;t and forceible Attack upon the Rights of others&punc; and not the Re&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch unju&s;t Force? I &s;hould be glad to know how Hanging a Murderer or Thief can be done without Vio|lence? And if Violence is la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful after the Fact is committed, I &s;hould gladly be informed, by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Head, how Violence comes to be unlawful (when all other Means fail) in order to prevent the Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>DOING Good for Evil, Loving our Enemies, and Praying for tho&s;e that per&s;ecute and calumniate us, are, no doubt, Chri&s;tian Duties: So are Cloathing the Naked and Feeding the Hungry. But, as we are not required to cloath the Naked and feed the Hungry, and want our&s;elves; &s;o neither are we obliged to &s;trengthen the Hands of an Enemy again&s;t our&s;elves; nor to pray for his Succe&s;s, when he aims De&s;truction at our Heads; nor to love him as if he was our Friend. We ought, indeed, to exerci&s;e Kindne&s;s and Humanity towards our Enemies, when we have them in our Power, and may do it with Security to our&s;elves; try to win and reclaim them, by Gentlene&s;s, For|bearance and Charity, and to pray that GOD may turn their Hearts; which is all that the&s;e Precepts require.</P>
<P>I proved to you in the Beginning, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that no &s;uper|natural Revelation of GOD's Will, can po&s;&s;ibly be contradic|tory or repugnant to Rea&s;on, which is the natural Revelation of his Will. I laid it down, as a Ground-Work, that GOD intended our Happine&s;s in our Creation. I have &s;hewn that Government and Political Society are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to human Happine&s;s; that the Pre&s;ervation of Government is equally e&s;&s;ential; that Force is nece&s;&s;ary to that Pre&s;ervation, and con&s;equently, that War was allowable under the Law of Nature. And, I think, it is &s;o apparent, from what has been &s;aid, that the Scripture cannot be ju&s;tly impeached with Altering the Law of Nature in this Point; or of having taken away Man's natural Right to &s;eek that Happine&s;s which GOD origi|nally de&s;ign'd him, by forbidding Chri&s;tians to defend their Lives and Properties when they are unju&s;tly invaded; that no intelligent Man, who examines it with an impartial, unpreju|diced Mind, can have the lea&s;t Doubt about it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004708_0013_100DC0D729725DE8">IF the Right to u&s;e Force is not connected with and in&s;epara|ble from Government, and included in the very Idea of it, I &s;hould be glad to know, how the lawful Commands or Mandates of the civil Magi&s;trate can po&s;&s;ibly be executed in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience? We &s;ee that the&s;e very People who a&s;&s;ert the Unlawfulne&s;s of all Manner of Defence, willingly &s;erve in the Legi&s;lature, con&s;ent to the Enacting Sanguinary and other Penal Laws, act as Sheriffs, &s;erve upon Juries, &s;it in Courts of Judicature, and there try and condemn Men to Death. Is it not Amazing, that any Men &s;hould take it into their Heads that it is lawful for one Chri&s;tian forceibly to put another to Death, after his Hands are tied behind him, and yet think it unlawful to bind him by Force, or even to kill him, in his unlawful Re&s;i&s;tance? Suppo&s;e a Banditti of an Hundred &s;tout, re&s;olute Fellows &s;hould a&s;&s;emble together, com|mit Murthers, Rapes, Robberies, de&s;troy and lay wa&s;te all be|fore them; what &s;tead do you think the Con&s;tables and their Staves would &s;tand you in, in order to &s;ubdue &s;o many a&s;&s;ociated Villains; and more e&s;pecially, if it be not lawful even for the Con&s;tables to make any U&s;e of their Staves in Ca&s;e of Re&s;i&s;tance. If it be &s;aid, that a Con&s;table, being an Officer of the Law, may be allowed to make U&s;e of his Staff in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, &s;eeing the Law has put it into his Ilands; I a&s;k why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may not make U&s;e of a Gun, or a Sword, in the like Nece&s;&s;ity, put into his Hands by the &s;ame Authority. If it be an&s;wered, that a Gun or a Sword may kill: I reply, &s;o may a Con&s;table's Staff. And if Con&s;tables, or other Officers of the Law, may make U&s;e of Guns and Swords, in Ca&s;es of Nece&s;&s;ity, I would willingly be informed, why all other Men have not the &s;ame Liberty under the like Nece&s;&s;ity. In a Word, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> to admit the U&s;efulne&s;s of civil Government to Mankind; and yet to advance the Po&s;ition, that Force and all Manner of Self-Defence is unlawful, is a Sy&s;tem full of Incon&s;i&s;tencies, and big with Ab&s;urdities and Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>PERHAPS &s;ome may think it &s;trange, that I, who have been educated among&s;t, and have always profe&s;s'd my&s;elf to be of the Society of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;hould, in this publick Manner, declare my&s;elf &s;o oppo&s;ite to their Sentiments, in the Point of Defence. I would have &s;uch to believe, that the Love of my Country, the Love of Mankind in general, but above all, the Love of Truth, is of greater Concernment to me, than what is called Uniformity, or the being &s;o attached to any particular Party in Religion, as to e&s;pou&s;e, or &s;eem to e&s;pou&s;e, any of the Errors of it. That of the Unlawfulne&s;s of Self-Defence to Chri&s;tians, is, to me, a mo&s;t capital Error;
<PB N="15" REF="004708_0014_100DC0D9F4EBD230">
not only dangerous to Society in general, as I have already &s;aid, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the very Nature of civil Communities; but, more particularly, of extream Danger to our&s;elves, at this critical Conjuncture. His Maje&s;ty is already engaged in a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary War with <HI>Spain:</HI> And a War with <HI>France</HI> is ge|nerally look'd upon as unavoidable. The Province of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania,</HI> and the&s;e Counties, are in the very Centre of his Ma|je&s;ty's Colonies in <HI>America.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> are &s;ettled within a few Days March of our Frontiers to the North-We&s;t of us: The Ocean bounds us to the Ea&s;tward, and will admit of the Landing of any Number of Men, almo&s;t every where. In Ca&s;e then of War with <HI>France,</HI> &s;o much to be apprehended; how di&s;mal is our Situation! &s;eeing we are &s;o much expo&s;ed on each Side, and of all his Maje&s;ty's Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> are the only ones that are without Troops, without Arms, and without Ammunition: And all this owing to an Oppo&s;ition in our &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, made by People who&s;e religious Per|&s;ua&s;ion leads them to condemn the U&s;e of Arms in general. Military Provi&s;ions can only be made by the Legi&s;lature. Our Governor, from a Zeal to his Maje&s;ty's Service, and the Secu|rity of &s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects as he is by the Royal Authority appointed to protect and govern, has frequently, in vain, warmly recommended this Thing to the A&s;&s;emblies of both Governments; and has been expre&s;sly an&s;wered by one of them,
<Q>that all Defence was, according to the religious Per|&s;ua&s;ion of the Majority of their Hou&s;e, unlawful.</Q>
And here I profe&s;s my&s;elf at a very great Lo&s;s, in what Manner to ju&s;tify, or even excu&s;e, the Conduct of my Brethren. The being really principled again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of Self-Defence, is, in it&s;elf innocent, as proceeding from an ill-informed Judgment, and only &s;hews the Unfitne&s;s of tho&s;e who are &s;o principled to be imployed in Legi&s;lation. But when &s;uch Per|&s;ons, by Plotting and Management, procure them&s;elves to be cho&s;en into the Legi&s;lature, at a critical Time, meerly to keep out and tie up the Hands of others, who&s;e religious Principles leave them at Liberty to provide for the Defence of their Coun|try, in Ca&s;e of a foreign Inva&s;ion; it amounts to a negative Per&s;ecution, and becomes highly blameable. The General A&s;&s;embly of the&s;e Counties, at the pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tance of our Honourable Governor, hath, indeed, very lately pa&s;s'd a Mi|litia-Law, in &s;pight of the Oppo&s;ition made, by tho&s;e who affirm all War to be unlawful, who happened to be the Mino|rity. This is &s;o far right, as it is Doing all in our Power; but, in Truth, can be of very little Security to us, &s;o long as the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> continues unprovided of all Means of Defence; and it mu&s;t ever continue &s;o unprovided, &s;o long

as nine Tenths of the Members of A&s;&s;embly are &s;uch as are per&s;uaded Defence is unlawful. I therefore thought it, <HI>Gentle|men,</HI> high Time to examine and expo&s;e a Doctrine &s;o ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, and &s;o ruinous in its Con&s;equences. It has been with this View that I have taken up &s;o much of your Time. How well I have &s;ucceeded in it, I leave others to judge.</P>
