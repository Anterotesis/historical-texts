<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we turn our thoughts inward, and con&s;ider the con|&s;titution of our bodies, toge|ther with all the powers and faculties of our &s;ouls: When we extend our views to the various parts of creation, and contemplate the beauty and harmony, as well as the evi|dent &s;igns, which every where appear, of an All|wi&s;e and righteous government; we &s;ay, for we cannot but &s;ay, there is one mo&s;t wi&s;e and omni|potent being, who governs the whole univer&s;e, and &s;uperintends the actions of all his creatures. To deny this, would be to deny and contradict our rea|&s;on, and dive&s;t our&s;elves of the honour and digni|ty of intelligent creatures. The government of mankind, and the pre&s;ervation of the numerous and various parts of the world, have in all ages ap|peared &s;o arduous, and &s;o much above the power, wi&s;dom, and fore-&s;ight of finite beings; that even the unenlightened heathens have repre&s;ented to them&s;elves, one nece&s;&s;ary and omnipotent being, &s;eated upon the throne of the univer&s;e, giving laws to all his creatures, with infinitely more ea&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s, than ever the mo&s;t wi&s;e and exalted earthly monarch could to the mo&s;t obedient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive nation. If this &s;entiment is not enforced by rea|&s;on and experience beyond contradiction; let us hear the maje&s;tic declaration of the &s;acred &s;crip|tures, which &s;ay. "And I ble&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t high,
<PB N="4" REF="015791_0003_0F9A29D269FC98A0">
and I prai&s;ed and honoured him that liveth for ever, who&s;e dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth, are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou? For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the Governor among the nations." The voice of nature and revelation, both a&s;&s;ure us, that all things were created for the manife&s;tation of God's glory. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge." But if the whole creation were left to it&s;elf, and all things &s;hould run into that confu&s;ion and di&s;order, which mu&s;t end in their total di&s;&s;olution; we are unable to &s;ee the glory of God promoted. Therefore the mo&s;t natural conclu&s;ion is, that as God has created all things, he al&s;o governs all things: as he is our cre|ator, &s;o he is our pre&s;erver, and governor. "For in him we live, and move, and have our being. By him all things con&s;i&s;t, and he upholdeth them by the word of his power." It is infinitely ea&s;y for God to govern the world, which he has made, and to di&s;po&s;e of all things, agreeable to the utmo&s;t wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s. And however ob|jections may ari&s;e, in the minds of &s;ome men, from a partial and &s;hort &s;ighted view of the government of God; &s;o that they may be ready either to &s;ay with the fool: "There is no God, or to doubt the certainty of his providence and &s;ay. "Doth God know, and is there knowledge in the mo&s;t high?" Yet rea&s;on and revelation teach us, that "The Lord reigneth, who is wi&s;e in heart, and mighty in &s;trength; and that when clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him: righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment are the habitation of his throne." This doctrine of
<PB N="5" REF="015791_0004_0F9A29D3289E21E0">
God's providence is carried to the greate&s;t perfec|tion, and is mo&s;t comfortably e&s;tabli&s;hed by our Sa|viour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "Are not (&s;ays he) two &s;par|rows &s;old for a farthing? And one of them &s;hall not fall on the ground without your father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered." Nothing but a prevailing conviction of the truth of this great doctrine, of God's pre&s;erving care and governing power, could ever rationally ju&s;tify and enforce the great and plea&s;ing duties of prayer, prai&s;e and thank&s;giving. For if God were ab&s;ent, or di&s;regarded us, in vain &s;hould we rai&s;e our hearts and our hands, in humble &s;upplications for the removal of approaching danger; and we &s;hould in vain joyfully exalt our voices, in united prai&s;es, for &s;ome remarkable deliverance and unmerited mercy. But why &s;hould I any farther pur&s;ue this &s;ubject? The pre&s;ence of this a&s;&s;embly &s;eems to confirm this truth more undeniably, than my voice is able.</P>
<P>This day, agreeable to the re&s;olution of the ho|nourable Continental Congre&s;s, our mo&s;t worthy General has called us together, to return mo&s;t humble and hearty thanks, to almighty God, for the many in&s;tances of his unmerited goodne&s;s, un|to us in general, as a nation, and in particular, for the very &s;ignal and compleat victory obtained, over a potent army of Britons. And I imagine, in the order for the convention of this a&s;&s;embly, I hear the words of my text repeated, and pointed out to me. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy, and for thy truth's &s;ake. And &s;hould I forget the&s;e words, and the in|tention of our meeting, and &s;pend your time in hearing military panegyrics on your wi&s;dom and valour, though you are truly entitled to more prai&s;e than my feeble tongue can expre&s;s: were I to in|vade the rights of heaven, and arrogate to our&s;elves all the prai&s;e of our late &s;ignal victory; I fore&s;ee
<PB N="6" REF="015791_0005_0F9A29D3E84449E0">
that I &s;hall draw upon my&s;elf the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of every wi&s;e and virtuous man; di&s;appoint your hopes and expectations, and, as far as my influence will go, turn this day's meeting into a cur&s;e. For the glory of all conque&s;ts and acqui&s;itions, &s;hould be a&s;cribed to God, as due to him alone: therefore we read, that when the people gave a &s;hout, &s;ay|ing, of Herod, "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man; immediately the angel of the Lord &s;mote him, becau&s;e he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the gho&s;t."</P>
<P>The words of David, in the hundred and fifteenth P&s;alm, are therefore the words of my text, and a proper guide to lead us to give all prai&s;e and glory to God. They were pronounced immediately after a recollection of God's miraculous power and good|ne&s;s, &s;hewn unto the I&s;raelites; and was intended to &s;hew the dependence men have upon God, and that he is the principal director of all happy and &s;ucce&s;sful events. Time would fail me to enume|rate all the rea&s;ons which we per&s;onally have to prai&s;e and glorify God. In order that our prai&s;es might keep pace with our mercies, every moment of our lives &s;hould be devoted to his &s;ervice, and all our actions directed to his glory.</P>
<P>The words, which are the ground of what &s;hall be &s;aid at this time, were drawn from the grateful heart of the king of the Jews, by public mercies, and were of national concern. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to follow the &s;pirit and intention of them, in a view &s;omewhat &s;imilar, and &s;peak of tho&s;e mer|cies which have been conferred upon us, and in which this great continent is intere&s;ted. Let us a&s;cribe unto God all power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, and &s;ay, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glo|ry given, who ha&s;t been plea&s;ed with unerring wi&s;|dom to direct, with unconquerable power to &s;up|port, and with never failing goodne&s;s to ble&s;s the United States of America, in all their wi&s;e coun|&s;els,
<PB N="7" REF="015791_0006_0F9A29D4A8AE90E8">
and &s;ucce&s;sful enterprizes, &s;ince the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>I need not inform you, Gentlemen and Fellow Soldiers, that many years pa&s;t the language of Bri|tain corre&s;ponded with the language of Pharoah and his cruel ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, who &s;aid, "come let us deal wi&s;ely with them, le&s;t they multiply." But when by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, we were enabled to elude all the &s;nares which were &s;o thick planted, both in Britain and America, to deprive us of our freedom; and a corrupt and tyrannical court found that arms alone could promi&s;e them any &s;ucce&s;s in their un|ju&s;t and inhuman de&s;igns of &s;ubjugating a free peo|ple: then we &s;aw the arms of the king of England turned again&s;t us, and threatening the ruin and de&s;truction of every thing, worthy the notice of a brave and wi&s;e man. Thus we beheld the invin|cible navy, which claimed the &s;ole dominion of the ocean, invading our country, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing our cities. Thus came forth the veterans of Britain, who had been &s;o accu&s;tomed to conquer, that vic|tory &s;eemed bound to their arms: and then we &s;aw the boors and mercenary, half-&s;tarved Germans, lured, like hungry harpies, and ravenous wolves, by the hope of preying upon the lives and e&s;tates, of the innocent Americans. But were all the&s;e war|like preparations nece&s;&s;ary for the conque&s;t of Ame|rica, when unprepared for ho&s;tilities? Surely it might have been rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that all this pomp and maje&s;ty of war, was de&s;tined again&s;t &s;ome powerful nation or army, accu&s;tomed to mark their way with de&s;truction, blood and carnage. How then mu&s;t our thankful amazement be excited, when we reflect upon our happy &s;ituation as free|men, and find our&s;elves able to &s;ay, we are not &s;laves: tho' oppre&s;&s;ion made &s;uch near and dreadful approaches to us, when in our mo&s;t defencele&s;s &s;tate.</P>
<P>Who, that is a friend to virtue and liberty, will
<PB N="8" REF="015791_0007_0F9A29EB97E13090">
a moment he&s;itate to give glory to God, for his pro|vidential care and goodne&s;s, in pre&s;erving us out of the hands of the enemy, who &s;eemed ready to &s;wallow us up, when we were without arms or am|munition, without &s;hips of war, and without the &s;kill or love of war. For the&s;e and innumerable in&s;tances of public mercy, we de&s;ire mo&s;t heartily to prai&s;e God, and &s;ay, "Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto the wi&s;dom of our coun&s;ellors, that their coun&s;els and wi&s;dom have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed our mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations. Not unto our commanders and armies tho' they have &s;o often behaved them|&s;elves valiantly, and conducted wi&s;ely; yet, give glory, not unto them, but unto the name of God; for he it was who taught our &s;enators wi&s;dom, and girded our &s;oldiers with courage and &s;trength. It is the Lord our God who has fought for us, in every &s;ucce&s;sful battle, and has hitherto &s;upported our righteous cau&s;e, again&s;t tho&s;e who hate us without any ju&s;t rea&s;on. Truely we may &s;ay, oh &s;ing unto the Lord a new &s;ong, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath got|ten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his &s;alvation: his righteou&s;ne&s;s hath he openly &s;hewed in the &s;ight of our enemies. He hath re|membered his mercy towards us; all the ends of the earth &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of our God. What &s;hall we render unto the Lord for di&s;po&s;ing a fo|reign nation, to &s;hew favour unto us, and &s;upply us with &s;uch a plentiful apparatus of war? How much have we acquired by &s;ea, where our expec|tations were the lea&s;t? But more particularly, let the voice of this day continue to a&s;cend, in mo&s;t hearty thanks, to Almighty God, for his great goodne&s;s in qualifying, and rai&s;ing up &s;o many worthy and wi&s;e men, to form the grand council of the United States of America, and be the guardians of our rights and privileges. Oh give thanks unto the Lord our God, for a brave general, the com|mander
<PB N="9" REF="015791_0008_0F9A29EC058EB6D8">
in chief of all our armies. A general po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch unparalleled fortitude and patience, and not more patient, than meek, virtuous and hu|mane. And if I am permitted to &s;ay any thing of a character, which &s;o much out&s;hines the brighte&s;t encomiums the writer can offer: I will venture to &s;ay, that if you &s;earch for faults, in the conduct of that true patriot, and mo&s;t excellent hero, you will find none, unle&s;s you call it a fault to excerci&s;e compa&s;&s;ion and lenity towards tho&s;e negligent and guilty offenders, who by their &s;loth and inatten|tion to the be&s;t orders, counteract the wi&s;e&s;t plans, and fru&s;trate the be&s;t &s;chemes of military di&s;cipline and policy. But this humane exce&s;s of goodne&s;s is found in the mo&s;t noble and exalted &s;ouls. Not to enumerate the various and evident &s;igns of an in|terpo&s;ing providence, which enabled us to extri|cate our&s;elves out of imminent danger, or to check the enemy's rage, even when our armies have been almo&s;t di&s;banded.</P>
<P>Methinks I &s;ee the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington, with but two or three thou&s;and men, retreating indeed before 10 or 12000 of the enemy; but yet checking thir progre&s;s thro' the country, and when reinforced by the brave militia, turning upon the enemy, killing &s;ome, captivating many, and obliging &s;o large an army to retire, and confine them&s;elves, during the whole winter, within narrow bounds. Oh America, give glory to God, for &s;uch a faithful hero! Then you &s;aw him greate&s;t when mo&s;t without your aid. Collected in him&s;elf, he greatly re&s;olved, with his few faithful followers, to be the barrier of liberty, or fall in its defence. Oh &s;ons of America, let it not again be &s;aid, that you &s;eemed to de&s;ert liber|ty and Wa&s;hington: But God &s;upported and pre|&s;erved him and us all; &s;o that in&s;tead of being con|quered, we gained &s;trength and knowledge, in the art and means of defence, during the two la&s;t cam|paigns: And having now nearly concluded the third
<PB N="10" REF="015791_0009_0F9A29ECAA5FE680">
campaign, although victory has not fully atten|ded us in every enterprize, the pro&s;pect is glorious, and far exceeds our former expectations or hopes, and calls us to prai&s;e God, and &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to our enemies.</P>
<P>Had any one, three or four years pa&s;t, ventured to predict, that we &s;hould have been able to have lived thro' &s;uch a tempe&s;t of war, and at length ar|rive within &s;ight of the haven of conque&s;t and peace; we &s;hould have called him an enthu&s;ia&s;tic prophet of madne&s;s and folly, and &s;aid he was un|acquainted with the &s;welling billows of Briti&s;h wrath; but having &s;temmed the torrent of oppre&s;|&s;ion and tyranny, tho' many times with no other hope of &s;ucce&s;s, than that which aro&s;e from a view of the mercy and ju&s;tice of God, and an humble expectation, that he would pity and vindicate a people, who were marked by their enemies for the &s;laughter of oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny, becau&s;e of their noble defence of the righteous cau&s;e of God and mankind. The Lord exerci&s;eth righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment, for all that are oppre&s;&s;ed. We now look back with plea&s;ing amazement, and &s;ay, this is the work of the Lord, and marvellous in our eyes. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto our wi&s;dom and fortitude, not unto our per&s;everance, patience, and courage, tho' they have been much greater than we could have flattered our&s;elves they would be; yet not unto us, but unto God give the glory. I have been unwilling to &s;hew a narrowne&s;s of &s;oul, by confining the prai&s;es of this day, to the &s;ubject of our glorious conque&s;t and fini&s;hed campaign, in the northern department: When our &s;ouls are fil|led with an overflowing &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s and mercy of God; we know not where to begin or where to end our a&s;criptions of prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving. Many have been the &s;treams of mercy, which have refre&s;hed our drooping &s;pirits, &s;ince the
<PB N="11" REF="015791_0010_0F9A29ED682348A8">
beginning of the pre&s;ent war, and often has our good God put &s;ongs of prai&s;e in our mouths; but this day, in the view of our late &s;ignal victory, more than all the &s;treams, of pa&s;t mercy and good|ne&s;s, &s;eem to be united, in con&s;tituting one copious river of goodne&s;s and love, and overflowing, and exceeding our highe&s;t prai&s;e and gratitude. Like the I&s;raelites of old, we beheld the enemy &s;ubdu|ed, and in &s;ilent and inexpre&s;&s;ible admiration, adored the Lord who wrought &s;uch a wonderful de|liverance, and with them we now &s;ay: Thy right hand, oh Lord! is become glorious in power; thy right hand, oh Lord! hath da&s;hed in pieces the enemy.</P>
<P>But let us now turn our attention to what may be con&s;idered the more immediate &s;ubject of this day's prai&s;e, namely our conque&s;t over the northern Briti&s;h army. Behold the enemy leave Canada, ten thou&s;and in number. Our &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es are evacuated. The enemy take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and afterwards pur&s;ue our little divided army, tho' not without a &s;pirited oppo&s;ition. Our army being &s;o much inferior to the enemy, were not able to protect the country, and &s;top the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h army, now flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, and tempt|ed to believe, that where ever they turned their arms, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t meet them, or oppo&s;ition be turned into flight. Nothing then &s;eemed to hinder them from &s;uddenly taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate of New York, from one end to the other. In this extremity of our public affairs, it was the &s;ea&s;on of Jehovah's merciful appearance; and the God whom we this day adore, turned their coun&s;els into fool|i&s;hne&s;s, and &s;et bounds to their rage. When the language of the enemy was, I will pur&s;ue, I will overtake, I will divide the &s;poil: my lu&s;t &s;hall be &s;atisfied upon them, I will draw my &s;word, my hand &s;hall de&s;troy them: God &s;ecretly &s;aid unto
<PB N="12" REF="015791_0011_0F9A29EEE8587208">
them, as he did to the waves of the &s;ea, hitherto &s;halt thou go, and no farther.</P>
<P>That the hand of God, was in this, has been acknowledged by the mo&s;t profane, in common with the wi&s;e and virtuous. For what but the pro|vidence of God could di&s;po&s;e a commander, of &s;en&s;e and experience, to divide his army, and leave the grand object which he fir&s;t had in view, when there appeared nothing to prevent him, from forming a junction with another army of Britain. Who in|&s;pired the inhabitants and militia of Bennington, with re&s;olution to oppo&s;e the enemy, with &s;uch in|credible bravery, and to kill and captivate &s;o great a number of them? Who in&s;pired the garri&s;on and militia to the we&s;tward, to make &s;o bold and re&s;o|lute a defence, to defeat the enemy there, &s;top their incur&s;ions, and &s;ave that part of the country from &s;avage barbarity? Courage and re&s;olution are as much the gifts of God, as any qualifications whatever; for without him the greate&s;t natural courage may be turned in fear. At that time, when our army were few in number, why did not the enemy improve the opportunity they had, of marching thro' the country, before we had time to collect, and oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, as we have &s;ince done? Under the checks and influence of divine Providence, the opportunity, which was &s;o pre|cious, being pa&s;t, they &s;uffered our army to collect, under the command of the brave and honourable general Gates. And when we had &s;o increa&s;ed in numbers, as to be able to advance, and meet the enemy in the field of battle, did not the Lord teach our hands to war, and our fingers to fight, &s;o that many of the enemy fell down &s;lain and wounded. Nor was the bravery of officers or men le&s;s in the &s;econd conflict, when the dead of the enemy were &s;trewed over the field, and the living cha&s;ed to their &s;trong holds. There you &s;aw the intrepid Arnold, like the thunder bolt of war, hurling <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="13" REF="015791_0012_0F9A29F068697968">
fear and death, among your terrified flying foes: and then fearle&s;s, and impatient of delay, you fol|lowed your hero, and forced the &s;trong lines of the enemy. Oh noble ardour for victory! brave con|tempt of death, where American liberty was the prize contended for! In vain did the enemy at|tempt to e&s;cape, tho' they might have &s;aid, as the Egyptians did, let us flee from the face of I&s;rael; for the Lord &s;ighteth for them, again&s;t us. However not to enter into more particulars, &s;ave that by the wi&s;dom and per&s;everance of the commander, and the vigilance and bravery of the officers and men, the enemy were neither able to flee from our ar|my, nor yet dared to ri&s;k a battle, nor able to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; thus the final grand re&s;ult of all, was, that they were by the good providence of God, delivered into the hands of our ar|my, and that without the lo&s;s of more precious American blood. And &s;o manife&s;t has been the hand of God, in all the&s;e tran&s;actions, that I have met with none, who&s;e &s;entiments do not very ful|ly corre&s;pond with the language of the text. Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's &s;ake. Be|hold, I am this day happy enough to remind you, of what hi&s;tory has &s;carcely a parallel. A potent ar|my and five generals, either cut off, or totally &s;ub|dued in one campaign. How great the addition which is made to our ordnance, our arms and mi|litary &s;tores; all the&s;e are acqui&s;itions not unwor|thy our mo&s;t grateful acknowledgment.</P>
<P>Thus far I have endeavoured to follow the &s;pi|rit of the text, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, imitate the p&s;almi&s;t, in the enumeration of many in&s;tances of God's goodne&s;s, and in humbly acknowledging that his hand has been in all. As far as I have &s;uc|ceeded in this way, &s;o far, I tru&s;t, I have not done ami&s;s. David, who was as great a warrior, and as valiant a prince, and as eminent a &s;aint, as ever
<PB N="14" REF="015791_0013_0F9A29F128528668">
lived or filled a throne, a&s;cribed all his &s;ucce&s;s to the over-ruling providence of God. Never had a man more rea&s;on to boa&s;t of his wi&s;dom and &s;ucce&s;s in war. In all his wars, &s;ucce&s;s waited upon his courage, and victory paid homage to his &s;word; yet he &s;ays, "I will not tru&s;t in my bow, neither &s;hall my &s;word &s;ave me. Thou art my king, oh God! through thee will we pu&s;h down our ene|mies; thro' thy name will we tread them under that ri&s;e up again&s;t us. It is God that girdeth me with &s;trength, and maketh my way perfect. Some tru&s;t in chariots, and &s;ome in hor&s;es; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God."</P>
<P>For le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than we have obtained, the an|tient Romans and Grecians &s;aid, let us ha&s;ten to the temples of the gods, and thank them for all their goodne&s;s and favour. And happy am I this day, when I con&s;ider, that the continental congre&s;s have &s;o publicly &s;hewn their wi&s;e, and humble acknow|ledgment of the &s;uperintendence of the king of kings, and lord of lords, and have invited every friend of virtue and liberty, throughout this va&s;t continent, to adore the one living and true God, and prai&s;e him for every merciful interpo&s;ition of his providence; to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to every &s;troke of his righteous hand, confe&s;&s;ing that his judgments are lighter than our &s;ins have de&s;erved, and that in the mid&s;t of de&s;erved wrath, he has been plea&s;ed to remember mercy.</P>
<P>Happy am I al&s;o to find, that we are plea&s;ed to be &s;een uniting with our brethren, in prai&s;ing God for that &s;ucce&s;s which you have been &s;o in&s;trumental in gaining. Oh happy victory which gives new life to the friends of liberty every where. This will rai&s;e the dignity and importance of our em|ba&s;&s;adors in Europe, and make us more and more re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world: and &s;hall I not hope, that this is a happy prelude to victory over all our enemies in America. Among the many
<PB N="15" REF="015791_0014_0F9A29F1EA066088">
ble&s;&s;ings which God has be&s;towed upon us, I mu&s;t not forget to take notice of the happy union, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the army, between the troops of the different &s;tates. All di&s;cord and animo&s;ity depart|ed, and made room for courage, friend&s;hip, and the united love of our country. Oh happy union, where all &s;trove to excel in bravery, and the &s;ervice of our common cau&s;e and intere&s;t. United we &s;tand, divided we fall, is a truth, which rea&s;on and the &s;acred &s;criptures both &s;upport. A kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand. We are brethren, we have the &s;ame God to wor&s;hip, and the &s;ame cau&s;e to defend. The happine&s;s of the one &s;tate, is the happine&s;s of the other; and as we have &s;een the good effects of that perfect harmony which has pre|vailed among us; let us cultivate it more and more, and may that man, who attempts to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and contention among us, be accounted our greate&s;t enemy, and be bani&s;hed from our &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>For a moment reflect on the divi&s;ions of the Ger|man and Briti&s;h troops. Nothing, under God, &s;o much contributed to their defeat, as their internal animo&s;ities and di&s;cord: but the hand of God was in this, and &s;et them again&s;t one another, as he did the &s;words of the Midianites again&s;t their fellows, throughout their whole camp. Therefore let bro|therly love and friend&s;hip cement us together; let a wi&s;e and patriotic zeal fire us with true courage; May a noblene&s;s of &s;oul, and a love of true honour, run thro' all our actions, and may a generous emu|lation in&s;pire us to excel in all the duties of the brave &s;oldier, and the accompli&s;hed gentleman.</P>
<P>Hear how &s;weetly the P&s;almi&s;t de&s;cribes the beauty and happine&s;s of union. Behold, how good and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell toge|ther in unity. As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that de&s;cended upon the mountains of Zion. And let me add, how good and how plea&s;ant was
<PB N="16" REF="015791_0015_0F9A29F2A8A6F798">
it, for the troops of the New-York and the New-Eng|land &s;tates to dwell together in unity. And let me go farther, and &s;ay, how nece&s;&s;ary, u&s;eful, and plea|&s;ant is it, for the brethren of the united &s;tates, to dwell together in unity. Surely for all the&s;e mer|cies, none will be backward to prai&s;e God.</P>
<P>I now enter upon a le&s;s joyful &s;ubject than the triumphs of victory; but it is to &s;ome the &s;ure at|tendant of conque&s;t. Suffer me, my dear fellow &s;oldiers, to check, for a moment, the current of joy and gladne&s;s, and blame me not for doing ho|nor to the memory of the brave heroes, who fell in battle, honourably defending their country. They well de&s;erve the tribute of a tear, and are ju&s;tly entitled to the honour of being recorded in our brea&s;ts, among the &s;aviours of our country. For us and po&s;terity they bravely fought, and bled, and died, and fell in the field of glory, and the arms of victory. With us they were acquainted, and to us they were dear. Neither officers nor &s;ol|diers &s;hall be ungratefully forgotten by us; for they have done honour to their country, and made a generous &s;acrifice of their lives, to the rights and liberties of mankind. Such bravery is worthy of imitation, and gives a dignity to human nature. Follow therefore, ye men of war, their noble ex|ample, and to all your innate bravery, join love to all the friends of liberty, and true love to God, who covered your heads in the day of battle, and &s;hielded you from death, when you &s;aw his arrows fly &s;o thick around you, and &s;o many were &s;lain. I be&s;eech you, let not your near e&s;cape from death, harden you again&s;t God, and di&s;po&s;e you to forget and neglect him. He is continually doing you good; why will you offend him, and di&s;regard the innu|merable obligations, you are under, to be obedient to his laws and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his will. Behold, how tenderly the P&s;almi&s;t repre&s;ents the care and kindne&s;s of the Lord, unto all tho&s;e who put their
<PB N="17" REF="015791_0016_0F9A29F369914410">
tru&s;t in him. He &s;hall cover thee with his fea|thers, and under his wings &s;halt thou tru&s;t. Thou &s;halt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flyeth by day. In the &s;trength of God, therefore, go on ye heroes, who, in two battles with the enemy, bravely fought, and have &s;urvived tho&s;e conflicts, and are happily before me this day, employed in the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and dig|nified &s;ervice, of prai&s;ing and adoring the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of battle, who with infinite ea&s;e di&s;|po&s;es all the events of war, and guides the &s;eem|ingly ca&s;ual revolutions of kingdoms and &s;tates, to his own appointed purpo&s;es. Walk in the road of glory, and the plea&s;ant path of true virtue, and gather fre&s;h laurels in every enterprize. Regret not your removal from the late &s;ucce&s;sful command of the honourable general Gates, for here is his excellency general Wa&s;hington. Look on him, and catch the genuine patriot fire of liberty and inde|pendence. Look on him, and learn to forget your own ea&s;e and comfort; like him re&s;ign the charms of dome&s;tic life, when the genius of America bids you grow great in her &s;ervice, and liberty calls you to protect her. Look on your worthy general, and claim the happine&s;s and honour of &s;aying, he is ours. Like him love virtue, and like him, reve|rence the name of the great Jehovah. Be mindful of that public declaration which he has made. "That we cannot rea&s;onably expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our arms, if we continue to prophane his holy name. Learn of him to endure watchings, cold and hard&s;hips, for you have ju&s;t heard that he a&s;&s;ures you, he is ready and willing, to endure whatever inconveniencies and hard&s;hips may at|tend this winter.</P>
<P>Are any of you &s;tartled at the pro&s;pect of hard winter quarters? Think of liberty and Wa&s;hing|ton, and your hard&s;hips will be forgotten and ba|ni&s;hed. Let Europe, nay let the world hear, that
<PB N="18" REF="015791_0017_0F9A29F429DEFE80">
the American army, in the defence of their coun|try, chearfully &s;ubmitted to the inconvenience of having no other hou&s;es of accommodation, than &s;uch as their own hands reared in the depth of win|ter. Be encouraged, therefore, to undertake all that has been propo&s;ed to you, in the generals or|ders. And let me a&s;&s;ure you, from &s;ome little ex|perience obtained, in three campaigns, that what has appeared hard and impracticable, at a di&s;tance, has been found tolerable and ea&s;y, when the wor&s;t that could be imagined has arrived.</P>
<P>Surely you, who have carried the war to the ve|ry walls of Quebec, and &s;upported it through the whole winter, will not complain of the winter's cold, in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. But there are few of this brigade, who are not inured to war, who are not veterans in hard&s;hips, and lo&s;&s;es, as well as in the &s;ervice of their country. Let us be firm and exact in the di&s;charge of our &s;everal du|ties, as &s;oldiers and officers; and by our ardour in the common cau&s;e, by our patience and obedience, render our&s;elves re&s;pectable, and honourable, in the fight of our leader, and make it &s;eem a plea|&s;ure to command us.</P>
<P>Allow me to &s;ay, my dear gentlemen officers and fellow-&s;oldiers, I cannot be &s;atisfied that we &s;hould be only as good as others; I earne&s;tly wi&s;h to have the honour of &s;aying, This is the be&s;t brigade in the continental &s;ervice: and &s;uch a one we may be, if we will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, how much we can po&s;&s;ibly do to &s;erve the public, without going out of our proper &s;phere of action.</P>
<P>Ba&s;e is the man, whether in the civil, eccle&s;ia&s;|tical or military department, who contents him&s;elf with doing only &s;o much, as will pre&s;erve him from the reproach of gro&s;s and vi&s;ible neglect of duty. An army con&s;i&s;ts of many parts, and if &s;ome parts move either too &s;low, or not at all, the great whole will be thrown into confu&s;ion and di&s;order,
<PB N="19" REF="015791_0018_0F9A29F4E895E868">
and con&s;equently &s;uffer. Uniformity of motion in all the parts, gives &s;trength, and ea&s;e, and beauty, and expedition, which is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in every enterprize. Not an individual per&s;on in the army, but may contribute &s;o much, in the regular and &s;trict di&s;charge of his duty, to the good of the whole, that, were he &s;eperated from the army, it would &s;uffer &s;ome real lo&s;s. Let every one there|fore con&s;ider how u&s;eful, important, and honourable he may render him&s;elf, in the army and in the &s;er|vice of his country: and on the other hand, how mean and contemptible he mu&s;t appear, if he is either unacquainted with his duty, or negligent in the performance of it.</P>
<P>I now pa&s;s on, having already taken notice in &s;ome in&s;tances, of your valour and &s;ucce&s;s, to re|commend to you the caution, which is recorded in the word of God. Let not him that girdeth on the harne&s;s, boa&s;t as him that putteth it off. The war is not yet at an end, the enemy are not all conquer|ed, tho' &s;o large an army has been totally &s;ubdued. We have yet an army to oppo&s;e; but our pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s is glorious. How &s;oon it may plea&s;e God to deliver them into our hands, or call them away, would be ra&s;h in me to venture to tell; but I however look forward, with an inconceivable plea&s;ure, and view, not far off, American liberty e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a &s;ure and honourable foundation. Be therefore undaunted in battle, and mode&s;t in pro&s;perity; the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of mind belong to the character of a brave and great man. But I had little rea&s;on to exhort you in either of the&s;e re|&s;pects, for you have been culpable in neither. Such a generous &s;pirit of candour and mode&s;ty, as you di&s;covered after &s;o &s;ignal a victory, has &s;carcely been known in any army. Our enemies them&s;elves acknowledge, that when they marched in pri&s;oners of war, none of our troops in&s;ulted them, or &s;hew|ed any &s;igns of contempt, or di&s;re&s;pect. Happy

was I to hear this from the mouth of an enemy. Your conduct, my friends and countrymen, was truely characteri&s;tic of brave and noble &s;pirited men. Cowards in&s;ult tho&s;e who fall into their hands; but the brave are compa&s;&s;ionate, and fight no longer than there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. Let general Burgoyne, and his officers generou&s;ly &s;peak the truth, and bear witne&s;s that nothing was want|ing, on the part of the noble &s;pirited general Gates, and his officers, to render them as happy as po&s;&s;ible, and even make them forget that they were con|quered. Glad have I been to find that our gene|rous and kind treatment of pri&s;oners, has been &s;uch, that it extorted, even from Britons this con|fe&s;&s;ion; that we treated them much more mildly, than we &s;hould have been treated in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion. Not &s;o have our mo&s;t unhappy brethren been treated, who have fallen into the hands of general Howe. Let the mean in&s;ults which Britons have &s;o liberally offered to officers of rank and note; officers who might have ju&s;tly di&s;dained to a&s;&s;oci|ate with men, who had neither principles of ge|nero&s;ity nor humanity, and yet men who had ma|ny of them received unmerited favours from the Americans, whom they dared to in&s;ult. Let the&s;e mean and unmanly in&s;ults, let the wanton cruel|ties of &s;tripping helple&s;s women and children of the very means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, de&s;troying their hou&s;es, and burning our towns, in a manner which nothing contributed to fini&s;h the war; let all the&s;e things convince the world that we fight with men, who are neither gentlemen, nor honourable &s;oldiers, nor yet men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the common feelings of humanity. May the dying groans, of fami&s;hed &s;ol|diers, be lodged in the merciful ear of him, who hears the pri&s;oners cry, and will be avenged upon cruel, hard hearted, and bloody men. Oh! tell it not in America, that her &s;ons peri&s;hed for want of a mor&s;el of bread to eat; and yet proclaim thro'
<PB N="21" REF="015791_0020_0F9A29F6681ED020">
the world, that Britons tortured their pri&s;oners, even to death, by the lingering torments of hun|ger. And &s;till do my ears hear of the &s;ame cruel|ties exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e who are &s;o unfortunate as to fall into their hands. The blood of &s;o many already murdered, has not &s;atiated tho&s;e cruel men. Ala&s;s! too many are now unhappy victims to their relentle&s;s rage. Oh! merciful God, if thou ha&s;t permitted that nation &s;uddenly to fill up the cup of their iniquity, that thy vengeance may be executed upon them; let not, we be&s;eech thee, their cup be filled with American blood.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured my friends, that under God, the only means to procure you good treatment, are the &s;harpne&s;s of your &s;words, and your &s;kill in war, and your invincible courage in battle. May the groans of the hunger-&s;tarved, may the griefs and indigni|ties, &s;orrows and aflictions of our &s;uffering bre|thren fire your minds, and &s;pur you on to military revenge and univer&s;al conque&s;t.</P>
<P>I leave the painful gloomy &s;ubject, and return to con&s;ider what improvement we &s;hall make, of the many in&s;tances of God's goodne&s;s and mercy, which have been the &s;ubjects of this day's prai&s;e and gratitude. The improvement which Jo&s;hua, the heroic and pious leader of the I&s;raelites made of all the victories and triumphs which they had ob|tained, was, that they &s;hould love the Lord their God. Take good heed therefore unto your&s;elves, &s;aid he, that ye love the Lord your God. All pub|lic mercies are be&s;towed for this very purpo&s;e, that they may be improved for the honour and glory of God. Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and all thy &s;oul, is the fir&s;t, and great commandment of the law: And God in all his pro|vidential dealings with us, whether merciful or afflictive, enforceth what his law demands. David, after receiving great &s;ucce&s;s, &s;aid, I will have thee, oh Lord! my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

hero and eminent &s;aint, and manife&s;t the thankful|ne&s;s of our hearts, for the unexpected and unmerited favours conferred on us, by loving the Lord our God, and fearing to offend him in any re&s;pect. It is becau&s;e the compa&s;&s;ions of the Lord fail never that we have not been con&s;umed. His judgments &s;ometimes appear, and with a &s;tern and &s;evere voice command our obedience unto his laws, and &s;ay, "Turn ye, turn ye, for why &s;hould ye be &s;triken any more." But how much more frequent|ly, do his mercies addre&s;s us in the milde&s;t ac|cents, and invite our return unto him.</P>
<P>Surely when God confers mercies and favours upon us, who are not only unworthy of them, but have de&s;erved to be &s;everely puni&s;hed: our hearts mu&s;t be hard and void of every grateful feeling, if they are not melted into love and thankfulne&s;s for &s;uch great goodne&s;s. If we give our&s;elves time to reflect upon our pa&s;t conduct, either as a people, or as individuals, we mu&s;t confe&s;s that the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance of God's goodne&s;s and mercy, has been truely unmerited, and far beyond any thing we could rea&s;onably have expected. We have mo&s;t ba&s;ely offended our mo&s;t merciful and gracious God, and that even when he has &s;aved us out of the hands of our enemies, and loaded us with his benefits. During the pre&s;ent year in particular, men have too commonly lived as if there was no God to take notice, and they were not accountable creatures. Alas my friends, you cannot be ignorant that the name of the great Jehovah, has been commonly prophaned by the profligate &s;wearer, in bold and open defiance of his laws and authority. Here might I avail my&s;elf of the tremendous cur&s;es of God's holy law, and thunder out the denuncia|tions of heaven again&s;t wilful offenders, and &s;ay, <HI>"Cur&s;ed &s;hall ye be if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God: and the Lord your God will not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain."</HI></P>

But I forbear, the gentle voice of mercy this day calls upon you; I therefore pa&s;s by every thing dreadful and har&s;h, and be&s;eech you to &s;uffer your|&s;elves to be &s;ubdued by the overflowing, diffu&s;ive goodne&s;s of God. The way to obtain greater ble&s;&s;|ings, is to be truly thankful for tho&s;e we have already received.</P>
<P>We have this day been prai&s;ing God, but, believe me, prai&s;e cannot a&s;cend acceptably to God, unle&s;s it ri&s;e upon the wings of love and obedience. Come then, my friends, con&s;ecrate your&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the Lord our God, humble your&s;elves on the account of pa&s;t &s;ins, and &s;in no more. Let the world know that the man who loves and fears the living and the true God, fears not any danger, in the road of his duty. For the man who puts his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in his God, and engages in his &s;ervice, is in the &s;ure&s;t way of protection and &s;afety; or if it &s;hould plea&s;e the Lord, to call him, by death, from the field of battle, it would only be a removal, a little &s;ooner, from the foot &s;tool on earth, to the throne of glory, in heaven. Learn then to endure hardne&s;s as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And, oh I be&s;eech you! as on my bended knees, reverence and obey the words of that Saviour, who has done and &s;uffered &s;o much for the &s;alvation of &s;uch guilty &s;inners as you and me.</P>
<P>SWEAR NOT AT ALL. Think how horridly un|grateful it is to offend and affront that God, who is continually doing us &s;o much good. Since God has &s;o remarkably &s;miled upon the arms of the United States, let the &s;incerity of our gratitude be &s;een by taking heed to fear and love him; and let me a&s;|&s;ure you, that to live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly, is the only way to &s;hew the thankfulne&s;s of your hearts, and the high e&s;teem you have of all our mercies.</P>

May we never forget the tran&s;actions of this day, nor the occa&s;ion of our meeting.

May brigades of angels guard our commander thro' all the toils and dangers of war, until peace, liberty and independence are e&s;tabli&s;hed; nor let them leave him thro' life, nor at death, but &s;afely convoy him to the regions of eternal liberty and happine&s;s, and &s;eat him high, as the mo&s;t renowned heroes of liberty and religion. May angels look down upon us with plea&s;ure and approbation, while we are contending with our enemies, and grappling with every difficulty in the defence of the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven. But above all may our adoring prai&s;e a&s;cend up to God, &s;o pure and &s;incere, that it will plea&s;e him to &s;ay, concern|ing us, I will ble&s;s this people yet more, I will add unto them ble&s;&s;ings tenfold more. Your enemies &s;hall fall before you by the &s;word. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye &s;hall be my people.</P>
<P>Let us, my friends and fellow &s;oldiers, unite in earne&s;tly praying, that God would engage our hearts, in &s;incere love and holy obedience to him&s;elf. Then may we hope and expect, that the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of battle, will go with our armies, and lead them to new and greater victories, until at length the horrors of war, &s;hall be terminated in a &s;afe, honourable and la&s;ting peace.</P>
<P>May God grant this, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of his love; to whom with the Father, and Holy Gho&s;t, be a&s;cribed, as is mo&s;t due, all might, maje&s;ty, and dominion, forever, Amen.</P>
