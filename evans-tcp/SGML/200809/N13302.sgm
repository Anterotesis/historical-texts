<HEAD>AN EXTRACT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t Part of Mankind, nay of Chri&s;tians, may be &s;aid to be a&s;leep; and that particular Way of Life, which takes up each Man's Mind, Thoughts, and Affections, may very well be called his particular Dream. This De|gree of Vanity is equally vi&s;ible in every Form and Order of Life. The Learned and the Ignorant, the Rich and the Poor, are all in the &s;ame State of Slumber; only pa&s;&s;ing away a &s;hort Life in a different Kind of a Dream. But why &s;o? It is becau&s;e Man has an Eternity within him, is born into this World, not for the Sake of living here, not for any Thing this World can give him, but only to have Time and Place to become either an eternal Partaker of a divine Life with God, or to have an helli&s;h Eternity among&s;t fallen Angels: And therefore, every Man who has not his Eyes, his Heart, and his Hands, continually governed by this two-fold Eternity, may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be fa&s;t a&s;leep, to have no awakened Sen&s;ibility of him&s;elf. And a Life devoted to Intere&s;t, and the Enjoyments of this World, &s;pent and wa&s;ted in the Slavery of earthly De&s;ires,

may be truly called a Dream, as having all the Shortne&s;s, Vanity and Delu&s;ion of a Dream; only with this Difference, that when a Dream is over, nothing is lo&s;t but Fictions and Fancies: but when the Dream of Life is ended only by Death, all that Eternity is lo&s;t, for which we were brought into Being. Now there is no Mi&s;ery in this World, no|thing that makes either the Life or Death of Man to be full of Calamity, but this Blind|ne&s;s and In&s;en&s;ibility of his State, into which he &s;o willingly, nay ob&s;tinately, plunges him|&s;elf. Every Thing that has the Nature of Evil and Di&s;tre&s;s in it, takes its Ri&s;e from thence. Do but &s;uppo&s;e a Man to know him&s;elf; that he comes into this World on no other Errand, but to ri&s;e out of the Vanity of Time into the Riches of Eternity; do but &s;uppo&s;e him to govern his inward Thoughts and outward Actions by this View of him&s;elf, and then to him every Day has lo&s;t all its Evil; Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity have no Difference, becau&s;e he receives and u&s;es them both in the &s;ame Spirit; Life and Death are equally welcome, becau&s;e equally Parts of his Way to Eternity. For poor and mi&s;erable as this Life is, we have all of us free Acce&s;s to all that is great, and good, and happy; and carry within our&s;elves a Key to all the Trea&s;ures that Heaven has to be|&s;tow upon us.&mdash;We &s;tarve in the Mid&s;t of Plenty, groan under Infirmities, with the Remedy in our own Hands; live and die
<PB N="5" REF="016817_0005_0F9E7F62BA53F9F0">
without knowing and feeling any Thing of the one only Good, whil&s;t we have it in our Power to know and enjoy it in as great a Reality, as we know and feel the Power of this World over us: For Heaven is as near to our Souls, as this World is to our Bodies; and we are created, we are redeemed, to have our Conver&s;ation in it: God, the only Good of all intelligent Natures, is not an ab&s;ent or di&s;tant God, but is more pre&s;ent in and to our Souls, than our own Bodies; and we are Strangers to Heaven, and with|out God in the World, for this only Rea&s;on, becau&s;e we are void of that Spirit of Prayer, which alone can, and never fails to unite us with the one only Good, and to open Hea|ven and the Kingdom of God within us. All our Salvation con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Manife&s;tation of the Nature, Life, and Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our inward new Man.</HI> This alone is Chri&s;|tian Redemption; this alone delivers from the Guilt and Power of Sin; this alone re|deems, renews, and regains the fir&s;t Life of God in the Soul of Man. Every Thing be|&s;ides this is <HI>Self,</HI> is <HI>Fiction,</HI> is <HI>Propriety,</HI> is <HI>own Will,</HI> and however coloured, is only thy <HI>old Man, with all his Deeds.</HI> Enter therefore with all thy Heart into this Truth, let thy Eye be always upon it, do every Thing in View of it, try every Thing by the Truth of it, love Nothing but for the Sake of it. Wherever thou goe&s;t, whatever thou do&s;t at Home, or Abroad, in the Field, or at

Church, do all in a De&s;ire of Union with Chri&s;t, in Imitation of his Tempers and Inclinations, and look upon all as Nothing, but that which exerci&s;es and encrea&s;es the Spirit and Life of Chri&s;t in thy Soul. From Morning to Night keep Je&s;us in thy Heart, long for Nothing, de&s;ire Nothing, hope for Nothing, but to have all that is within Thee, changed into the Spirit and Temper of the Holy Je&s;us. Let this be thy <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> thy <HI>Church,</HI> and thy <HI>Religion.</HI> For this new Birth in Chri&s;t thus firmly believed, and continually de&s;ired, will do every Thing that thou wante&s;t to have done in Thee, it will dry up all the Springs of Vice, &s;top all the Workings of Evil in thy Nature, it will bring all that is Good into Thee, it will open all the Go&s;pel within Thee, and thou wilt know what it is to be taught of God. This longing De&s;ire of thy Heart to be <HI>one</HI> with Chri&s;t, will &s;oon put a Stop to all the Vanity of thy Life, and nothing will be admitted to enter into thy Heart, or proceed from it, but what comes from God, and returns to God; thou wilt &s;oon be, as it were, tied and bound in the Chains of all holy Affections and De&s;ires, thy <HI>Mouth</HI> will have a <HI>Watch</HI> &s;et upon it, thy <HI>Ears</HI> would willingly hear nothing that does not tend to God, nor thy Eyes be open, but to &s;ee, and find Occa&s;ions of doing Good. In a Word, when this Faith has got both thy <HI>Head</HI> and thy <HI>Heart,</HI> it will then be with thee, as it was with the <HI>Merchant</HI>

who found a <HI>Pearl of Great Price,</HI> it will make thee gladly to <HI>&s;ell all that thou ha&s;t, and buy it.</HI> For all that had &s;eized and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the Heart of any Man, whatever the <HI>Merchant</HI> of this World had got together, whether of Riches, Power, Honour, Learn|ing or Reputation, lo&s;es all its Value, is counted but as <HI>Dung,</HI> and willingly parted with, as &s;oon as this glorious Pearl, the new Birth in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is di&s;covered and found by him. This therefore may &s;erve as a <HI>Touch&s;tone,</HI> whereby every one may try the Truth of his State; if the old Man is &s;till a <HI>Merchant</HI> within thee, trading in all Sorts of worldly Honour, Power or Learn|ing, if the Wi&s;dom of this World is not Fooli&s;hne&s;s to thee, if earthly Intere&s;ts, and &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, are &s;till the De&s;ire of thy Heart, and only covered under a <HI>Form</HI> of Godline&s;s, a <HI>Cloke</HI> of Creeds, Ob&s;ervances and In&s;titutions of Religion, thou may&s;t be a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Pearl of Great Price</HI> is not yet found by thee. For where Chri&s;t is born, or his Spirit ri&s;es up in the Soul, <HI>there all Self</HI> is denied, and obliged to turn out; <HI>there</HI> all carnal Wi&s;dom, Arts of Advance|ment, with every Pride and Glory of this Life, are as &s;o many <HI>Heathen Idols,</HI> all will|ingly renounced, and the Man is not only content, but rejoices to &s;ay, that <HI>his Kingdom is not of this World.</HI></P>
<P>But thou wilt perhaps &s;ay, how &s;hall this great Work, the Birth of Chri&s;t, be effected
<PB N="8" REF="016817_0008_0F9E7F64D917E3A0">
in me? It might rather be &s;aid, &s;ince Chri&s;t has an infinite Power, and al&s;o an infinite De&s;ire to &s;ave Mankind, how can any one mi&s;s of this Salvation, but through his <HI>own Unwillingne&s;s</HI> to be &s;aved by him? Con&s;ider, how was it that the <HI>Lame</HI> and <HI>Blind,</HI> the <HI>Lunatick</HI> and <HI>Leper,</HI> the <HI>Publican</HI> and <HI>Sinner,</HI> found Chri&s;t to be their Saviour, and to do <HI>all That</HI> for them, which they wanted to be done to them? It was becau&s;e they had a <HI>real De&s;ire</HI> of having <HI>That</HI> which they a&s;ked for, and therefore in true <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> applied to Chri&s;t, that his Spirit and Power might enter into them, and heal That which they wanted, and de&s;ired to be healed in them. Every one of the&s;e &s;aid in <HI>Faith and De&s;ire, Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou can&s;t make me whole.</HI> And the An&s;wer was always this, <HI>According to thy Faith, &s;o be it done unto Thee.</HI> This is Chri&s;t's An&s;wer <HI>now,</HI> and thus it is done to every one of us at this Day, as <HI>our Faith is, &s;o is it done unto us.</HI> And here lies the whole Rea&s;on of our falling &s;hort of the Salvation of Chri&s;t, it is becau&s;e we have <HI>no Will</HI> to it.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, Do not all Chri&s;tians de&s;ire to have Chri&s;t to be their Saviour? Yes. But here is the Deceit; all would have Chri&s;t to be their Saviour in the <HI>next World,</HI> and to help them into Heaven when they die, by his Power and Merits with God. But this is not <HI>willing</HI> Chri&s;t to be thy Sa|viour; for his Salvation, if it is had, mu&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="016817_0009_0F9E7F674443FAE0">
be had in this World, if He &s;aves Thee, it mu&s;t be done in this Life, by changing and altering <HI>all that is within Thee,</HI> by helping thee to a new Heart, as he helped the Blind to &s;ee, the Lame to walk, and the Dumb to &s;peak. For to have Salvation from Chri&s;t, is nothing el&s;e but to be made like unto Him; it is to have his Humility and Meek|ne&s;s, his Mortification and Self-denial, his Renounciation of the Spirit, Wi&s;dom, and Honours of this World, his Love of God, his De&s;ire of doing God's Will, and &s;eeking only his Honour. To have the&s;e Tempers formed and begotten in thy Heart, is to have Salvation from Chri&s;t; but if thou <HI>will<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> not</HI> to have the&s;e Tempers brought forth in thee, if thy Faith and De&s;ire does not &s;eek and cry to Chri&s;t for them in the <HI>&s;ame Reality,</HI> as the Lame a&s;ked to walk, and the Blind to &s;ee, then thou mu&s;t be &s;aid to be <HI>unwilling</HI> to have Chri&s;t to be thy Saviour.</P>
<P>Again, Con&s;ider, how was it that the car|nal <HI>Jew,</HI> the deep-read <HI>Scribe,</HI> the learned <HI>Rabbi,</HI> the religious <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> not only did not receive, but <HI>crucified</HI> their Saviour? It was becau&s;e they <HI>willed</HI> and <HI>de&s;ired</HI> no &s;uch Saviour as He was, no &s;uch <HI>inward Salvation</HI> as He offered to them. They de&s;ired no Change of their own Nature, no inward De&s;truction of their own natural Tempers, no Deliverance from the Love of them&s;elves, and the Enjoyments of their Pa&s;&s;ions; they liked their State, the Gratifications of their
<PB N="10" REF="016817_0010_0F9E7F68265F45D0">
old Man, their <HI>long Robes,</HI> their <HI>broad Phi|lacteries,</HI> and <HI>Greetings</HI> in the Markets. They wanted not to have their <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Self-love</HI> dethroned, their Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Sen&s;uality to be &s;ubdued by a new Nature from Heaven derived into them. Their only De&s;ire was the Succe&s;s of <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> to have an <HI>outward</HI> Saviour, a <HI>temporal</HI> Prince, that &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h their <HI>Law</HI> and Cere|monies over all the Earth. And therefore they crucified their dear Redeemer, and would have none of his Salvation, becau&s;e it all con&s;i&s;ted in a Change of their Nature, in a <HI>new Birth</HI> from above, and a Kingdom of Heaven to be opened <HI>within</HI> them by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>Oh Chri&s;tendom, look not only at the <HI>old Jews,</HI> but &s;ee thy&s;elf in this Gla&s;s. For at this Day, (Oh &s;ad Truth to be told!) at this Day, a Chri&s;t <HI>within</HI> us, an <HI>inward</HI> Saviour rai&s;ing a <HI>Birth</HI> of his own Nature, Life, and Spirit within us, is rejected as gro&s;s <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> the learned <HI>Rabbies</HI> take Coun|&s;el again&s;t it. The Propagation of <HI>Popery,</HI> the Propogation of <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m,</HI> the Succe&s;s of &s;ame <HI>particular</HI> Church, is the <HI>Salvation</HI> which Prie&s;ts and People are chiefly con|cerned about.</P>
<P>But to return: It is manife&s;t, that no one can fail of the Benefit of Chri&s;t's Salvation, but through an <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> to have it, and from the &s;ame Spirit and Tempers which made the <HI>Jews</HI> unwilling to receive it. But
<PB N="11" REF="016817_0011_0F9E7F68A91647B0">
if thou would&s;t &s;till farther know how this great Work, the <HI>Birth</HI> of Chri&s;t, is to be effected in thee, then let this joyful Truth be told thee, that this great Work is <HI>already</HI> begun in every one of us. For this holy Je&s;us, that is to be formed in thee, that is to be the Saviour and new Life of thy Soul, that is to rai&s;e thee out of the Darkne&s;s of Death into the Light of Life, and give thee Power to become a Son of God, is already <HI>within</HI> thee, living, &s;tirring, calling, knock|ing at the Door of thy Heart, and wanting nothing but thy own <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>good Will,</HI> to have as real a Birth and Form in thee, as he had in the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> For the eternal <HI>Word,</HI> or Son of God, did not then fir&s;t be|gin to be the Saviour of the World, when he was born in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> of <HI>Judea;</HI> but that Word, which became Man in the Vir|gin <HI>Mary,</HI> did, from the Beginning of the World, enter as a <HI>Word</HI> of Life, a <HI>Seed</HI> of Salvation, into the fir&s;t Father of Mankind, was in&s;poken into him, as an ingrafted Word, under the Name and Character of a <HI>Brui&s;er of the Serpent's Head.</HI> Hence it is, that Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>the Kingdom of God is within you;</HI> that is, the Divine Nature is within you, given unto your fir&s;t Father, into the Light of his Life, and from him ri&s;ing up in the Life of every Son of <HI>Adam.</HI> Hence al&s;o the holy Je&s;us is &s;aid to be the <HI>Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> Not as he was born
<PB N="12" REF="016817_0012_0F9E7F695E646928">
in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> not as He had an human Form upon Earth; in the&s;e Re&s;pects he could not be &s;aid to have been the Light of every Man that cometh into the World; but as he was that <HI>eternal Word,</HI> by which all Things were created, which was the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> of all Things, and which had as a <HI>&s;econd</HI> Crea|tor entered again into fallen Man, as a Brui|&s;er of the Serpent; in this re&s;pect it was truly &s;aid of our Lord, when on Earth, that <HI>He was that Light which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World.</HI> For He was really and truly all this, as He was the <HI>Immanuel,</HI> the God <HI>with us,</HI> given unto <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him to all his Offspring. See here the Beginning and glorious Extent of the <HI>Catholic Church</HI> of Chri&s;t, it takes in all the World. It is God's unlimited, univer|&s;al Mercy to all Mankind; and every human Creature, as &s;ure as he is born of <HI>Adam,</HI> has a Birth of the Brui&s;er of the Serpent within him, and &s;o is infallibly in Covenant with God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Hence al&s;o it is, that the Holy Je&s;us is appointed to be Judge of all the World, it is becau&s;e all Mankind, all Nations and Languages have in him, and through him, been put into Covenant with God, and made capable of re&s;i&s;ting the Evil of their fallen Nature.</P>
<P>When our ble&s;&s;ed Lord conver&s;ed with the Woman at <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well, He &s;aid unto her, <HI>If thou knewe&s;t the Gift of God,</HI> and <HI>who it is that talketh with Thee, thou woulde&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="016817_0013_0F9E7F6A44672E98">
have a&s;ked of Him, and he would have given Thee living Water.</HI> How happy (may any one well &s;ay) was this Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> to &s;tand &s;o near this <HI>Gift of God,</HI> from whom &s;he might have had living Water, had &s;he but vouch&s;afed to have a&s;ked for it! But, dear Chri&s;tian, this Happine&s;s is thine; for this Holy Je&s;us, <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> fir&s;t given unto <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him to all that are de|&s;cended from him, is the <HI>Gift of God</HI> to Thee, as &s;ure as thou art born of <HI>Adam;</HI> nay, ha&s;t thou never yet owned him; art thou wan|dered from him, as far as the Prodigal Son from his Father's Hou&s;e? Yet is he &s;till with Thee, he is the Gift of God to Thee, and if thou wilt turn to Him, and a&s;k of Him, he has living Water for Thee.</P>
<P>Poor Sinner! con&s;ider the Trea&s;ure thou ha&s;t within Thee, the Saviour of the World, the eternal Word of God lies hid in Thee, as a Spark of the Divine Nature, which is to overcome Sin and Death, and Hell within Thee, and generate the Life of Heaven again in thy Soul. Turn to thy Heart, and thy Heart will find its Saviour, its God within it&s;elf. Thou &s;ee&s;t, heare&s;t, and feele&s;t no|thing of God, becau&s;e thou &s;eeke&s;t for Him <HI>abroad</HI> with thy outward Eyes, thou &s;eeke&s;t for him in Books, in Controver&s;ies, in the Church, and outward Excerci&s;es, but <HI>there</HI> thou wilt not find Him, till thou ha&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> found Him in thy Heart. Seek for Him in thy Heart, and thou wilt never &s;eek in vain,
<PB N="14" REF="016817_0014_0F9E7F6AD95AF780">
for there he dwelleth, there is the Seat of his Light and Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>For this turning to the Light and Spirit of God within Thee, is thy <HI>only true</HI> turn|ing unto God, there is no other Way of finding Him, but in that Place where he dwelleth in Thee. For though God be every where pre&s;ent, yet He is only pre&s;ent to Thee in the deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t central Part of thy Soul. Thy natural <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s God, or unite Thee to him, nay thy inward Faculties of <HI>Under&s;tanding, Will,</HI> and <HI>Memory,</HI> can only reach after God, but can|not be the <HI>Place</HI> of his Habitation in Thee. But there is a <HI>Root,</HI> or <HI>Death</HI> in Thee, from whence all the&s;e Faculties come forth, as Lines from a <HI>Center,</HI> or as Branches from the Body of the Tree. This Depth is called the <HI>Center,</HI> the <HI>Fund,</HI> or <HI>Bottom</HI> of the Soul. This Depth is the <HI>Unity,</HI> the <HI>Eternity,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the <HI>Infinity</HI> of thy Soul; for it is &s;o infinite, that nothing can &s;atisfy it, or give it any Re&s;t, but the Infinity of God. In this <HI>Depth</HI> of the Soul, the Holy Trinity brought forth its own living Image in the fir&s;t created Man, bearing in Him&s;elf a liv|ing Repre&s;entation of Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, and this was his Dwelling in God and God in Him. This was the Kingdom of God <HI>within</HI> Him, and made Paradi&s;e <HI>without</HI> Him. But the Day that <HI>Adam</HI> did eat of the forbidden earthly Tree, in that Day he ab&s;olutely died to this King|dom
<PB N="15" REF="016817_0015_0F9E7F6E9B5C68E8">
of God <HI>within Him</HI>: This Depth, or <HI>Center</HI> of his Soul having lo&s;t its God, was &s;hut up in Death and Darkne&s;s, and became a Pri&s;oner in an earthly Animal, that only excelled its Brethren, the Bea&s;ts, in an up|right Form, and &s;erpentile Subtlety. Thus ended the Fall of Man. But from that Mo|ment that the God of Mercy in&s;poke into <HI>Adam</HI> the Brui&s;er of the Serpent, from that Moment all the Riches and Trea&s;ures of the Divine Nature came again into Man, as a <HI>Seed</HI> of Salvation &s;own into the <HI>Center</HI> of the Soul, and only lieth hidden there in every Man, till he de&s;ires to ri&s;e from his fallen State, and to be born again from above.</P>
<P>Awake then, thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and Chri&s;t, who, from all Eternity, hath been e&s;pou&s;ed to thy Soul, &s;hall give Thee Light. Begin to Search and dig in thine own Field for this <HI>Pearl of Eternity,</HI> that lieth hidden in it; it cannot co&s;t Thee too much, nor can&s;t thou buy it dear; for it is <HI>All,</HI> and when thou ha&s;t found it, thou wilt know, that all which thou ha&s;t fold, or given away for it, is as meer a Nothing, as a Bubble upon the Water.</P>
<P>But if thou turne&s;t from this heavenly Pearl, or trample&s;t it under thy Feet, for the Sake of being Rich or Great, either in Church or State, if Death finds Thee in <HI>this Succe&s;s,</HI> thou can&s;t not then &s;ay, that though the <HI>Pearl</HI> is lo&s;t, yet <HI>&s;omething</HI> has

For in that parting Moment, the <HI>Things,</HI> and the <HI>Sounds</HI> of this World, will be exactly alike; to have had an <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> or only to have <HI>heard</HI> of it; to have lived at <HI>Lambeth</HI> twenty Years, or only to have twenty Times <HI>pa&s;&s;ed by</HI> the Palace, will be the <HI>&s;ame Good,</HI> or the &s;ame <HI>Nothing</HI> to Thee.</P>
<P>But I will now &s;hew a little more di&s;tinct|ly, what this <HI>Pearl of Eternity</HI> is. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of God within Thee, which has hitherto done Thee but little Good, becau&s;e all the De&s;ire of thy Heart has been after the Light and Spirit of this World. Thy Rea&s;on and Sen&s;es, thy Heart and Pa&s;&s;ions, have turned all their Attention to the poor Concerns of this Life, and therefore thou art a Stranger to this Principle of Heaven, this Riches of Eternity within Thee. For as God is not, cannot be truly found by any Wor&s;hippers, but tho&s;e who wor&s;hip Him in <HI>Spirit</HI> and in <HI>Truth,</HI> &s;o this Light and Spirit, though always within us, is not, cannot be found, felt, or enjoyed, but by tho&s;e, who&s;e whole Spirit is turned to it.</P>
<P>When Man fir&s;t came into Being, and &s;tood before God as his own Image and Likene&s;s, this <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of God was as <HI>natural</HI> to him, as truly the Light of his Nature, as the <HI>Light and Air</HI> of this World is natural to the Creatures that have their Birth in it. But when Man, not content
<PB N="17" REF="016817_0017_0F9E7F719AD82970">
with the Food of Eternity, did eat of the earthly Tree, this Light and Spirit of Hea|ven was no more <HI>Natural</HI> to him, no more ro&s;e up as a Birth of his Nature, but, in|&s;tead thereof, he was left &s;olely to the Light and Spirit of this World. And this is <HI>that Death</HI> which God told <HI>Adam</HI> he &s;hould &s;urely die, in the Day that he &s;hould eat of the forbidden Tree.</P>
<P>But the Goodne&s;s of God would not leave Man in this Condition; a Redemption from it was immediately granted, and the Brui&s;er of the Serpent brought the Light and Spirit of Heaven <HI>once more</HI> into the hu|man Nature. Not as it was in its fir&s;t State, when Man was in Paradi&s;e, but as a <HI>Trea&s;ure hidden</HI> in the Center of our Souls, which &s;hould di&s;cover, and open it&s;elf by Degrees, in &s;uch Proportion, as the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of our Hearts were turned to it. This Light and Spirit of God thus freely re&s;tored again to the Soul, and lying in it as a <HI>&s;ecret Source</HI> of Heaven, is called <HI>Grace, Free Grace,</HI> or the <HI>Supernatural</HI> Gift, or Power of God in the Soul, becau&s;e it was &s;ome|thing, that the Neutral Powers of the Soul could no more obtain. Hence it is, that in the greate&s;t Truth, and highe&s;t Reality, every <HI>Stirring</HI> of the Soul, every <HI>Tendency</HI> of the Heart towards God and Goodne&s;s, is <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> a&s;cribed to the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>Grace</HI> of God. It is becau&s;e this <HI>fir&s;t Seed</HI> of Life, which is &s;own into

the Soul, as the <HI>Gift</HI> or <HI>Grace</HI> of God to fallen Man, is it&s;elf the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, and therefore every <HI>Stirring,</HI> or <HI>Open|ing</HI> of this Seed of Life, every awakened Thought or De&s;ire that ari&s;es from it, mu&s;t be called the <HI>Moving,</HI> or the <HI>Quickening</HI> of the Spirit of God; and therefore that new Man which ari&s;es from it, mu&s;t, of all Nece&s;&s;ity, be &s;aid to be <HI>&s;olely the Work and Operation of</HI> God. Hence al&s;o we have an ea&s;y and plain Declaration of the true Mean|ing, &s;olid Sen&s;e, and certain Truth, of all tho&s;e Scriptures, which &s;peak of the <HI>In&s;pira|tion</HI> of God, the Operation of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> the Power of the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> as the <HI>&s;ole</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Agents in the Renewal and Sanctification of our Souls and al&s;o as being Things <HI>common</HI> to all Men.

Hence al&s;o it is, that all Men are exhorted not to <HI>quench,</HI> or <HI>re&s;i&s;t,</HI> or <HI>grieve</HI> the Spirit; that is, this <HI>Seed of the Spirit and Light of God</HI> that is in <HI>all</HI> Men, as the only Source of Good.

<P>When this <HI>Seed,</HI> of the Spirit, <HI>common</HI> to all Men, is not re&s;i&s;ted, grieved and quench|ed, but its <HI>In&s;pirations</HI> and <HI>Motions</HI> &s;uffered to grow and increa&s;e in us, to unite with God, and get Power over all the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, then we are born again, the Na|ture, Spirit and Tempers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are opened in our Souls, the Kingdom of God is come, and is found within us.

<P>See here in &s;hort the State of Man as re|deemed. He has a <HI>Spark</HI> of the Light and

Spirit of God, as a <HI>Supernatural Gift</HI> of God given into the Birth of his Soul, to bring forth by Degrees a <HI>New Birth</HI> of that Life, which was lo&s;t in Paradi&s;e. This Holy Spark of the Divine Nature within Him, has a natural, &s;trong, and almo&s;t infinite Tendency, or Reaching after that eternal Light and Spirit of God, from whence it came forth. It came forth from God, it came <HI>out</HI> of God, it <HI>partaketh</HI> of the Divine Nature, and therefore it is always in a State of Tendency and Return to God. And all this is called the <HI>Breathing,</HI> the <HI>Moving,</HI> the <HI>Quickening</HI> of the Holy Spirit within us, which are &s;o many Operations of this Spark of Life tending towards God. On the other Hand, The Deity&punc; as con&s;idered in it&s;elf, and <HI>Without</HI> the Soul of Man, has an <HI>infinite, unchangeable</HI> Tendency of Love, and de&s;ire towards the Soul of Man, to unite, and communicate its own Riches and Glories to it, ju&s;t as the Spirit of the <HI>Air without</HI> Man, unites, and communicates its Riches and Virtues to the Spirit of the Air that is <HI>with|in</HI> Man.

to that Image of God, in which he was fir&s;t created. The Go&s;pel is the Hi&s;tory of this Love of God to Man. Inwardly he has a <HI>Seed</HI> of the Divine Life given into the Birth of his Soul, a Seed that has all the <HI>Riches of Eternity</HI> in it, and is always want|ing to come to the Birth in him, and be alive in God.

<P>Con&s;ider this Matter in the following Si|militude. A <HI>Grain</HI> of Wheat has the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> of this World inclo&s;ed, or incor|porated in it: This is the My&s;tery of its Life, this is its Power of Growing, by this it has a &s;trong continual Tendency of unit|ing again with that <HI>Ocean</HI> of Light and Air, from whence it came forth, and &s;o it helps to kindle its own vegetable Life.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, That great <HI>Ocean</HI> of Light and Air, having its own <HI>Offspring</HI> hidden in the Heart of the Grain, has a perpetual &s;trong Tendency to unite and communicate with it again.

<P><PB N="22" REF="016817_0022_0F9E7F75A865D7B8">But here let it be well ob&s;erved, that this De&s;ire on both Sides cannot have its Effect, till the <HI>Hu&s;k</HI> and gro&s;s Part of the Grain falls into a State of Corruption and Death, till this begins, the My&s;tery of Life hidden in it, cannot come forth. The Application here may be left to the Reader. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that we may here &s;ee the true Ground, and ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of that dy|ing to our&s;elves, and to the World, to which our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;o con&s;tantly calls all his Followers. An univer&s;al Self-denial, a per|petual Mortification of the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not a Thing impo&s;ed upon us by the <HI>mere Will</HI> of God, is not required as a <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> is not an Invention of dull and <HI>monki&s;h</HI> Spi|rits, but has its <HI>Ground</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in the Nature of the Thing, and is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make Way for the New Birth, as the Death of the <HI>Hu&s;k,</HI> and gro&s;s Part of the Grain, is nece&s;&s;ary to make Way for its vegetable Life.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> this <HI>Pearl of Eternity</HI> is the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of God within Thee. In this Pearl of thy Serpent Brui&s;er, all the Holy Nature, Spirit, Tempers, and Inclina|tions of Chri&s;t lie as in a Seed, in the Cen|ter of thy Soul, and divine Wi&s;dom, and heavenly Love, will grow up in Thee, if thou give&s;t but true Attention to God pre|&s;ent in thy Soul. On the other Hand, there is hidden al&s;o in the Depth of thy Nature,
<PB N="23" REF="016817_0023_0F9E7F761E7C9890">
the <HI>Root,</HI> or <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of all the helli&s;h Na|ture, Spirit and Tempers of the fallen An|gels. For Heaven and Hell have each of them their <HI>Foundation</HI> within us, they come not into us from <HI>without,</HI> but &s;pring up in us, according as our <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI> is turned either to the Light of God, or the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s.

Glorious Names, Sons of Wi&s;dom, that &s;hone, as Lights hung out by God, in the Mid&s;t of idolatrous Darkne&s;s.

And what Wonder? &s;ince it is not Art or Sci|ence, or Skill in Grammar or Logic, but the Opening of the Divine Life in the Soul, that can give true Under&s;tanding of the Things of God.

compared to a Grain of Mu&s;tard Seed, may be, and too generally is, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and kept under, either by worldly Cares, or Plea&s;ures, by vain Learning, Sen&s;uality, or Ambition. And all this while, whatever Church or Profe&s;&s;ion any Man is of, he is a meer <HI>Natural</HI> Man, <HI>unregenerate, unenlight|ened</HI> by the Spirit of God, becau&s;e this Seed of Heaven is choaked, and not &s;uffered to grow up in him.

<P>On the other Hand, wherever this Seed of Heaven is &s;uffered to take Root, to get Life and Breath in the Soul, whether it be in Man or Woman, young or old, there this new born inward Man is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be <HI>in&s;pired, enlightened and moved</HI> by the Spirit of God, becau&s;e his whole Birth

and Life is a Birth from above, of the Light and Spirit of God, and therefore all that is in him, hath the Nature, Spirit and Tem|pers of Heaven in it. As this regenerate Life grows up in any Man, &s;o there grows up a true and real Knowledge of the whole My&s;tery of Godline&s;s in him&s;elf. All that the Go&s;pel teaches of Sin and Grace, of Life and Death, of Heaven and Hell, of the New and Old Man, of the Light and Spirit of God, are Things not got by <HI>Hear|&s;ay,</HI> but inwardly known, felt and experi|enced, in the Growth of his own new born Life. He has then an <HI>Unction</HI> from above, which teacheth him all Things, a Spirit that <HI>knoweth what it ought to pray for,</HI> a Spirit that <HI>prays without cea&s;ing,</HI> that is ri&s;en with Chri&s;t from the Dead, and has all its Conver&s;ation in Heaven; a Spirit that hath <HI>Groans and Sighs that cannot be uttered,</HI> that travaileth and groaneth with the whole Creation, to be delivered from Vanity, and have its glorious Liberty in that God, from whom it came forth.</P>

All is fruitle&s;s and in&s;ignificant, all the Means of thy Redemption are at a Stand, all outward Forms are but a dead Formality, till this Fountain of Living Water is found within Thee.</P>

own Rea&s;on, run not on in thy own Will, but be retired, &s;ilent, pa&s;&s;ive, and humbly attentive to this new ri&s;en Light within Thee.

only for this <HI>one End,</HI> to fit, prepare, and di&s;po&s;e the Soul for the <HI>Operation</HI> of the Spirit of God upon it.

They will keep Thee &s;afe from all Errors, and fal&s;e Zeal in Things, and Forms of Re|ligion, from a Sectarian Spirit, from Bigotry and Super&s;tition; they will teach Thee the true Difference between the Means and End of Religion, and the Regard thou &s;hewe&s;t to the <HI>Shell,</HI> will be only &s;o far as the <HI>Kernel</HI> is to be found in it.</P>
<P>Man, by his Fall, had broke off from his true <HI>Center,</HI> his proper Place in God, and therefore the Life and Operation of God was no more in Him. He was fallen from a Life in God, into a Life of <HI>Self,</HI> into an animal Life of Self-love, Self-e&s;teem, and Self-&s;eeking in the poor peri&s;hing Enjoy|ments of this World. This was the <HI>Natu|ral State</HI> of Man by the Fall. He was an Apo&s;tate from God, and his natural Life was all Idolatry, where <HI>Self</HI> was the great Idol that was wor&s;hipped in&s;tead of God. See here the whole Truth in &s;hort. All Sin, Death, Damnation and Hell, is nothing el&s;e but this Kingdom of <HI>Self,</HI> or the various Operations of Self-love, Self-e&s;teem, and Self-&s;eeking, which &s;eparate the Soul from God, and end in eternal Death and Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="016817_0033_0F9E7F80B9E75D40">On the other Hand, all that is <HI>Grace, Redemption, Salvation, Sanctification, Spiri|tual Life,</HI> and the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> is nothing el&s;e but &s;o much of the Life and Operation of God found again in the Soul. It is Man come back again into his <HI>Center,</HI> or <HI>Place</HI> in God, from whence he had broke off. The Beginning again of the Life of God in the Soul, was then fir&s;t made, when the Mercy of God in&s;poke into <HI>Adam</HI> a <HI>Seed</HI> of the Divine Life, which &s;hould brui&s;e the Head of the Serpent, which had wrought it&s;elf into the human Nature.

and Hell, open a new Di&s;pen&s;ation of God, and baptize Mankind afre&s;h with the Holy Gho&s;t, and Fire of Heaven. Then, that is, on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> a <HI>new Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of God came forth; which, on God's Part, was the Operation of the Holy Spirit in Gifts and Graces upon the whole Church.

And that Man, baptized with the Holy Spirit, and born again from Above, &s;hould ab&s;olutely renounce <HI>Self,</HI> and wholly give up his Soul to the Operation of God's Spirit, to know, to love, to will, to pray, to wor&s;hip, to preach, to exhort, to u&s;e all the Faculties of his Mind, and all the outward Things of this World, as enlight|ened, in&s;pired, moved and guided by the Holy Gho&s;t; who, by this la&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ation of God, was given to be a Comforter, a Teacher, and Guide to the Church, who &s;hould abide with it for ever.</P>
<P>This is Chri&s;tianity, a &s;piritual Society, not becau&s;e it has no worldly Concerns, but becau&s;e all its Members, as &s;uch, are born of the Spirit, kept alive, animated and go|verned by the Spirit of God. It is con&s;tant|ly

called, by our Lord, the Kingdom of God, or Heaven, becau&s;e all its <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Service,</HI> all that is done in it, is done in Obedience and Subjection to <HI>that Spirit,</HI> by which Angels live, and are governed in Heaven. Hence our ble&s;&s;ed Lord taught his Di&s;ciples to pray, that this Kingdom might come, that &s;o God's Will might be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven, which could not be but by that &s;ame Spirit by which it is done in Heaven. The &s;hort is this: The Kingdom of <HI>Self,</HI> is the Fall of Man, or the great Apo&s;tacy from the Life of God in the Soul, and every one, wherever he be, that liveth unto <HI>Self,</HI> is &s;till under the Fall and great Apo&s;tacy from God.

The&s;e two Kingdoms take in all Mankind, he that is not of one, is certainly in the other; dying to one, is living to the other.</P>
<P>Hence we may gather the&s;e following Truths: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Here is &s;hewn the true Ground and Rea&s;on of what was &s;aid above, name|ly, That when the <HI>Call</HI> of God to Repent|ance fir&s;t ari&s;eth in thy Soul, thou art to be <HI>retired, &s;ilent, pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and humbly attentive to this new ri&s;en Light within thee, by wholly &s;topping, or di&s;regarding the Work|ings
<PB N="36" REF="016817_0036_0F9E7F82DC767BD8">
of thy own Will, Rea&s;on and Judgment. It is becau&s;e all the&s;e are fal&s;e Coun&s;ellors, the &s;worn Servants, bribed Slaves of thy fallen Nature, they are all born and bred in the Kingdom of <HI>Self;</HI> and therefore if a new Kingdom is to be &s;et up in Thee, if the Operation of God is to have its Effect in Thee; all the&s;e natural Powers of <HI>Self</HI> are to be &s;ilenced and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, till they have learned Obedience and Subjection to the Spirit of God. Now this is not requir|ing thee to become a <HI>Fool,</HI> or to give up thy Claim to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, but is the &s;hort|e&s;t Way to have thy Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on de|livered from Folly, and thy whole rational Nature &s;trengthened, enlightened, and guid|ed by that Light, which is Wi&s;dom it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A Child that obediently denies his own Will, and own Rea&s;on, to be guided by the Will and Rea&s;on, of a truly wi&s;e and under|&s;tanding Tutor, cannot be &s;aid to make him|&s;elf a Fool, and give up the Benefit of his rational Nature, but to have taken the &s;hort|e&s;t Way to have his own Will and Rea&s;on made truly a Ble&s;&s;ing to him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Hence is to be &s;een the true Ground and Nece&s;&s;ity of that univer&s;al Mor|tification and Self-denial with regard to all our Sen&s;es, Appetites, Tempers, Pa&s;&s;ions and Judgments. It is becau&s;e all our whole Nature, as fallen from the Life of God is in a State of Contrariety to the Order and End of our Creation, a continual Source of
<PB N="37" REF="016817_0037_0F9E7F839B4DF1C8">
di&s;orderly Appetites, corrupt Tempers, and fal&s;e Judgments And therefore every Mo|tion of it is to be mortified, changed and purified from its <HI>natural State,</HI> before we can enter into the Kingdom of God. Thus when our Lord &s;aith, <HI>Except a Man hateth his Father and Mother, yea, and his own Life, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple;</HI> it is becau&s;e our be&s;t Tempers are yet <HI>carnal,</HI> and full of the <HI>Imperfections</HI> of our fallen Nature. The Doctrine is ju&s;t and good: Not as if <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> were to be hated; but <HI>that Love,</HI> which an unregenerate Per&s;on, or <HI>natural Man,</HI> hath towards them, is to be <HI>hated;</HI> as being a blind <HI>Self-love,</HI> full of all the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Partialty,</HI> with which fallen Man loves, honours, e&s;teems and cleaves to him&s;elf. This love, <HI>born</HI> from corrupt Fle&s;h and Blood and <HI>polluted</HI> with Self, is to be <HI>hated</HI> and <HI>parted</HI> with, that we may love them with a Love <HI>born</HI> of God, with &s;uch a Love, and on &s;uch a Motive, as Chri&s;t hath loved us. And then the <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> of Chri&s;t far exceeds all others in the Love of Parents. Again, our <HI>own Life</HI> is to be <HI>hated;</HI> and the Rea&s;on is plain, it is becau&s;e there is nothing lovely in it. It is a <HI>Legion</HI> of Evil, a mon&s;trous Birth of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Fle&s;h;</HI> it is an <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> from the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of God in the Soul; a Life that is <HI>Death</HI> to Heaven, that is pure unmixed <HI>Idolatry,</HI> that lives wholly to <HI>Self,</HI> and not to God, and there|fore
<PB N="38" REF="016817_0038_0F9E7F849FBC6F78">
<HI>all this own Life</HI> is to be ab&s;olutely <HI>hated,</HI> all this Self is to be <HI>denied</HI> and <HI>mor|tified,</HI> if the Nature, Spirit, Tempers and Inclinations of Chri&s;t are to be brought to Life in us. For it is as impo&s;&s;ible to live to both the&s;e Lives at once, as for a <HI>Body</HI> to move two contrary Ways at the &s;ame Time. And therefore all the&s;e Mortifications and Self-denials have an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity in the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus when our Lord further &s;aith, unle&s;s a Man for&s;ake <HI>all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI> The Rea&s;on is plain, and the Nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olute; it is becau&s;e <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>natural</HI> Man hath, is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Self-love,</HI> and therefore <HI>this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> is to be ab&s;olutely <HI>for&s;aken,</HI> and parted with. All that he hath, is to be put into other Hands, to be given to divine Love, or this <HI>natural Man</HI> cannot be changed into a <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> of Chri&s;t. For Self-love in <HI>all that it hath,</HI> is earthly, &s;en&s;ual and devili&s;h, and therefore mu&s;t have <HI>all</HI> taken away from it; and then to the <HI>natural</HI> Man <HI>all</HI> is lo&s;t, he hath <HI>nothing</HI> left, all is laid down at the Feet of Je&s;us. And then all Things are common, as &s;oon as <HI>Self-love</HI> has lo&s;t the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. And then the Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, <HI>though hav|ing nothing, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth all Things;</HI> all that the <HI>natural</HI> Man hath <HI>for&s;aken,</HI> is re&s;tored to the <HI>Di&s;ciple</HI> of Chri&s;t an <HI>Hundred-fold.</HI> For Self-love, the greate&s;t of all <HI>Thieves,</HI> being now ca&s;t out, and all that he had

&s;tolen and hidden, thus taken from him, and put into the Hands of divine Love, every <HI>Mite</HI> becometh a large Trea&s;ure, and Mammon openeth the Door into everla&s;ting Habitations. This was the Spirit of the <HI>fir&s;t Draught</HI> of a Chri&s;tian Church at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> a Church made truly after the Pattern of Heaven, where the Love that reigns in Heaven reigned in it, where divine Love broke down all the &s;elfi&s;h Fences, the Locks and Bolts of <HI>me, mine, my own, &amp;c.</HI> and laid all Things common to the Members of this new Kingdom of God on Earth.</P>
<P>Now though many Years did not pa&s;s after the Age of the Apo&s;tles, before <HI>Satan</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> got Footing in the Church, and &s;et up Merchandize in the Hou&s;e of God; yet this <HI>one Heart;</HI> and <HI>one Spirit,</HI> which then fir&s;t appeared in the <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Church, is that <HI>one Heart</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of divine Love, to which <HI>all</HI> are called, that would be true Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. And though the Prac|tice of it is lo&s;t as to the Church in general, yet it ought not to have been lo&s;t; and there|fore every Chri&s;tian ought to make it his great Care, and Prayer, to have it re&s;tored in him&s;elf. And then, though born in the Dregs of Time, or living in <HI>Babylon,</HI> he will be as truly a Member of the fir&s;t hea|venly Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as if he had lived in it in the Days of the Apo&s;tles. This Spirit of Love, born of that cele&s;tial Fire, with which Chri&s;t baptizes his true Di&s;ciples,
<PB N="40" REF="016817_0040_0F9E7F872163A350">
is alone that Spirit, which can enter into Heaven, and therefore is that Spirit which is to be born in us, whil&s;t we are on Earth, For no one can enter into Heaven, till he is made heavenly, till the Spirit of Heaven is entered into him. And therefore all that our Lord hath &s;aid of denying and dying to <HI>Self,</HI> and of his parting with all that he hath, are Practices ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary from the Nature of the Thing.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e all turning to Self, is &s;o far turn|ing from God, and &s;o much as we have of Self-love, &s;o much we have of a helli&s;h, earthly Weight, that mu&s;t be taken off, or there can be no A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven. But thou wilt perhaps &s;ay, if <HI>all Self-love</HI> is to be renounced, then all Love of our Neigh|bour is renounced along with it, becau&s;e the Commandment is, only <HI>to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves.</HI> The An&s;wer here is ea&s;y, and yet no Quarter given to Self-love. There is but <HI>one only</HI> Love in Heaven, and yet the Angels of God love one another in the <HI>&s;ame Manner</HI> as they love them&s;elves. The Mat|ter is thus; the one &s;upreme, unchangeable <HI>Rule</HI> of Love, which is a <HI>Law</HI> to all intel|ligent Beings of all Worlds, and will be a Law to all Eternity, is this, viz. <HI>That God alone is to be loved for Him&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>all other Beings only</HI> in <HI>Him,</HI> and for <HI>Him.</HI> Whatever intelligent Creature lives not under this Rule of Love, is &s;o far fallen from the Order of his Creation, and is, till He returns to this
<PB N="41" REF="016817_0041_0F9E7F88415E3070">
eternal Law of Love, an <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI> from God, and incapable of the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>Now if God alone is to be loved for <HI>Him|&s;elf,</HI> then no Creature is to be loved for <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> and &s;o all <HI>Self-love</HI> in every Creature is ab&s;olutely condemned.</P>
<P>And if all created Beings are only to be loved <HI>in</HI> and <HI>for</HI> God, then my Neighbour is to be loved <HI>as</HI> I love my&s;elf, and I am only to love my&s;elf, as I love my Neigh|bour, or any other created Being, that is, only <HI>in</HI> and <HI>for</HI> God. And thus the Com|mand of loving our Neighbour as our&s;elves, &s;tands firm, and yet all Self-love is plucked up by the Roots. But what is loving any Creature, only <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>for,</HI> God? It is when we love it only, as it is God's <HI>Work, Image</HI> and <HI>Delight;</HI> when we love it merely as it is God's, and belongs to Him, this is loving it <HI>in</HI> God, and when all that we wi&s;h, in|tend, or do to it, is done from a Love of God, for the Honour of God, and in Con|formity to the Will of God, this is loving it <HI>for</HI> God. This is the <HI>one Love</HI> that is, and mu&s;t be the Spirit of all Creatures, that live united to God. Now this is no &s;peculative Refinement or fine-&s;pun Fiction of the Brain, but the &s;imple Truth, a fir&s;t Law of Nature, and a nece&s;&s;ary Band of Union between God and the Creature. The Creature is not in God, is a Stranger to Him, has lo&s;t the Life of God in it&s;elf, whenever its Love does not thus begin and end in God.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="016817_0042_0F9E7F891FD7EAA0">The Lo&s;s of this Love was the <HI>Fall</HI> of Man, as it opened in him a Kingdom of <HI>Self,</HI> in which Satan, the World, and the Fle&s;h, could all of them bring forth their own Works. If therefore Man is to ri&s;e from his Fall, and return to his Life in God, there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Self,</HI> with all his Brood of gro&s;s Affections, be de|po&s;ed, that this fir&s;t Love, in and for which he was created, may be born again in him. Chri&s;t came into the World to <HI>&s;ave Sinners,</HI> to de&s;troy the Works of the Devil. Now <HI>Self</HI> is not only the Seat and Habitation, but the very <HI>Life</HI> of Sin. The Works of the Devil are all wrought in <HI>Self,</HI> it is his pecu|liar <HI>Workhou&s;e,</HI> and therefore Chri&s;t is not come as a Saviour from Sin, as a De&s;troyer of the Works of the Devil in any of us, but <HI>&s;o far</HI> as Self is beaten down, and over|come in us. If it is literally true what our Lord &s;aid, <HI>That his Kingdom was not of this World,</HI> then it is a Truth of the &s;ame Certainty, that no one is a Member of this Kingdom, but he that, in the literal Sen&s;e of the Words, renounces the Spirit of this World. Chri&s;tians might as well part with Half the Articles of their Creed, or but Half believe them, as to really refu&s;e, or but by Halves enter into the&s;e Self-denials.</P>
<P>For all that is in the <HI>Creed,</HI> is only to bring forth this Dying and Death to all, and every Part of the old Man, that the Life and Spirit of Chri&s;t may be formed in us.</P>

Which Operation of God is the <HI>one only</HI> Thing that can rai&s;e the divine Life in the Soul, or help it to the &s;malle&s;t Degree of real Holine&s;s, or &s;piritual Life.

They practi&s;e them for their <HI>own Sakes,</HI> as Things good in them|&s;elves, they think them to be <HI>real</HI> Parts of Holine&s;s, and &s;o <HI>re&s;t</HI> in them, and look no <HI>farther,</HI> but grow full of Self-e&s;teem, and Self admiration for their own Progre&s;s in them. This makes them Self-&s;ufficient, mo|ro&s;e, &s;evere Judges of all tho&s;e that fall &s;hort of their Mortifications.</P>
<P>And thus their <HI>Self-denials</HI> do only <HI>that</HI> for them, which <HI>Indulgences</HI> do for other People; they with&s;tand and hinder the Ope|ration of God upon their Souls, and in&s;tead of being <HI>really</HI> Self-denials, they &s;trengthen and keep up the Kingdom of <HI>Self.</HI></P>
<P>There is no avoiding this fatal Error, but by deeply entering into this great Truth, that all our own Activity and Working has no Good in it, can do no Good to us, but
<PB N="45" REF="016817_0045_0F9E7F8B1C6491E8">
as it leads and turns us in the be&s;t Manner to the Light and Spirit of God, which alone brings Life and Salvation into the Soul. <HI>Stretch forth thy Hand,</HI> &s;aid our Lord to the Man, <HI>that had a withered Hand;</HI> he did &s;o, and <HI>it was immediately made whole as the other.</HI></P>
<P>Now, had this Man any Ground for Pride, or a high Opinion of him&s;elf, for the Share he had in the Re&s;toring of his Hand? Yet ju&s;t &s;uch is our Share in the rai&s;ing up of the &s;piritual Life within us. All that we can do by our own Activity, is only like this Man's &s;tretching out his Hand; the re&s;t is the Work of Chri&s;t, the only Giver of Life to the withered Hand, or the dead Soul. We can only then do living Works, when we are &s;o far born again, as to be able to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Yet not I, but Chri&s;t that liveth in me.</HI> But to return, and fur|ther &s;hew how the Soul that feels the Call of God to Repentance, is to behave under it, that this &s;tirring of the divine Power in the Soul, may have its full Effect, and bring forth the Birth of the new Man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. We are to con&s;ider it (as in Truth it is) as the <HI>Seed</HI> of the divine Nature within us, that can only grow by its <HI>own Strength,</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> with God. It is a divine Life, and therefore can grow from nothing but divine Power. When the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> conceived the Birth of the holy Je&s;us, all that &s;he did towards it her&s;elf, was only this
<PB N="46" REF="016817_0046_0F9E7F8BDBFFA5F8">
&s;ingle Act of Faith and Re&s;ignation to God: <HI>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word.</HI> This is all that we can do towards the Conception of that new Man that is to be born in our&s;elves. Now this Truth is ea&s;ily con&s;ented to, and a Man thinks he believes it, becau&s;e he con|&s;ents to it, or rather, does not deny it. But this is not enough, it is to be apprehended in a deep, full, and practical A&s;&s;urance, in &s;uch a Manner as a Man knows and believes that he did not create the <HI>Stars,</HI> or cau&s;e Life to rai&s;e up in him&s;elf. And then it is a Belief that puts the Soul into a right State, that makes Room for the Operation of God upon it. His Light then enters with full Power into the Soul, and his holy Spirit moves and directs all that is done in it, and &s;o Man lives again in God as a new Crea|ture. For this Truth thus firmly believed, will have the&s;e two mo&s;t excellent Effects: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it will keep the Soul fixed, and con|tinually turned towards God, in Faith, Pray|er, De&s;ire, Confidence, and Re&s;ignation to Him, for all that it wants to have done in it, and to it; which will be a continual Source of all divine Virtues and Graces. The Soul thus turned to God, mu&s;t be al|ways receiving from Him. It &s;tands at the true Door of all divine Communications, and the Light of God as freely enters into it, as the Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> enters into the <HI>Air. Secondly,</HI> It will fix and ground the
<PB N="47" REF="016817_0047_0F9E7F8C98D9FFE0">
Soul in a true and la&s;ting Self-denial. For by thus knowing, and owning our own <HI>Nothingne&s;s</HI> and Inability, that we have no other Capacity for Good, but that of re|ceiving it from God alone, <HI>Self</HI> is wholly denied, its Kingdom is de&s;troyed; no Room is left for &s;piritual Pride and Self-e&s;teem; we are &s;aved from a Phari&s;aical Holine&s;s, from wrong Opinions of our own Works and good Deeds, and from a Multitude of Errors, the mo&s;t dangerous to our Souls, all which ari&s;e from the <HI>Something</HI> that we take our&s;elves to be either in Nature or Grace. But when we once apprehend but in &s;ome Degree the <HI>All</HI> of God, and the <HI>Nothingne&s;s</HI> of our&s;elves, we have got a Truth, who&s;e U&s;efulne&s;s and Benefit, no Words can expre&s;s. It brings a Kind of Infallibity into the Soul in which it dwells; all that is vain, and fal&s;e, and deceitful, is forced to vani&s;h and fly before it. When our Religion is founded on this Rock, it has the Firmne&s;s of a Rock, and its Height reaches unto Heaven. The World, the Fle&s;h and the Devil can do no Hurt to it; all Enemies are known, and all di&s;armed by this great Truth, dwelling in our Souls. It is the Knowledge of the <HI>All</HI> of God, that makes <HI>Cherubims</HI> and <HI>Seraphims</HI> to be Flames of divine Love. For where this <HI>All</HI> of God is truly known and felt in any Creature, there its whole Breath and Spirit is a Fire of Love, nothing but a pure, di&s;intere&s;ted
<PB N="48" REF="016817_0048_0F9E7F8F26B587D8">
Love can ri&s;e up in it, or come from it, a Love that begins and ends in God. And where this Love is born in any Creature, there a Seraphick Life is born along with it. For this pure Love introduces the Crea|ture into the <HI>All</HI> of God, all that is in God, is opened in the Creature; it is united with God, and hath the Life of God manife&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>There is but <HI>one Salvation</HI> for all Man|kind, and that is the <HI>Life</HI> of God in the Soul. God has but <HI>one De&s;ign</HI> or Intent towards all Mankind, and that is to <HI>introduce</HI> or <HI>generate</HI> his own Life, Light, and Spirit in them, that all may be as &s;o many Images, Temples, and Habitations of the Holy Tri|nity. This is God's good Will to all <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Heathens.</HI> They are all <HI>equally</HI> the De&s;ire of his Heart, his Light continually <HI>waits</HI> for an Entrance into <HI>all</HI> of them, his <HI>Wi&s;dom crieth, &s;he putteth forth her Voice,</HI> not here, or there, but every where, in all the Streets of all the Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Now there is but <HI>one po&s;&s;ible</HI> Way for Man to attain this Salvation, or Life of God in the Soul. There is not one for the <HI>Jew,</HI> another for a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and a Third for the <HI>Heathen.</HI> No; God is one, human Nature is one, Salvation is one, and the <HI>Way</HI> to it is one; and that is, <HI>the De&s;ire of the Soul turned to God.</HI> When this <HI>De&s;ire</HI> is alive, and breaks forth in any Creature under

That they parch up and contract the &s;tomach to half its na|tural &s;ize, like burnt leather, and rot the entrails, as is evident, not only by opening the bodies of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are killed by drinking them; but al&s;o by what Doctor Hoffman &s;ays, was ob&s;erved of the effects which the cau&s;tic fiery remaining wa&s;h of the di&s;tillers, has on the guts of tho&s;e hogs which in &s;ome places are fed by it, which are thereby &s;o tendered, that puddings can|not be made in them: Wherefore all people, who have any regard to their health and lives ought to tremble at the cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors, which &s;horten and de&s;troy the lives of &s;uch multitudes of people. It is farther ob&s;ervable, that the free u&s;e of tho&s;e Spirits, deprave the morals of tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves thereto; the feelings of their minds are gradually benumbed; an in&s;en&s;ibility to the healing influences of grace prevails, and many become profane and re|gardle&s;s of their duty to God and Man.</P>
<P>Doctor Cheyne, in his E&s;&s;ay of health and long life, &s;ays, "All people, who have any regard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the fir&s;t cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors. The maladies begot by them bring forth nece&s;&s;ity upon nece&s;&s;ity of drams and gills; till at la&s;t, a kind drop&s;y, nervous convul&s;ion, flux, if not a fever, or phren&s;y &s;ets the poor &s;oul free. It has often

rai&s;ed in me, &s;ays the Doctor, the mo&s;t me|lancholly reflections, to &s;ee the virtuous and &s;en&s;ible, bound in &s;uch chains and fetters, as nothing le&s;s than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could relea&s;e them from."</P>
<P>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the &s;everity of wea|ther, to which men are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed; without which they &s;ay, they &s;hould peri&s;h with cold; which is probably, in a great mea&s;ure, true of tho&s;e who are habituated to drink them; the blood of &s;uch being thereby &s;o much improveri&s;hed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifele&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, without frequent repetitions; this is what &s;ome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are &s;ober per&s;ons to endure cold and hard&s;hips; their vital heat not being extingui&s;hed by intem|perance, does by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually &s;ecure them from the in|clemency of the weather, than the fal&s;e fla&s;h of a dram. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that men did not peri&s;h in the colde&s;t countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had, of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hud&s;on's bay, page 199: Where he ob&s;erves, "That the natives of the very cold coa&s;t of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to &s;ell

di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robu&s;t and active; whereas tho&s;e of them that are &s;upplied with drams from the Eng|li&s;h, are a meagre, dwarfi&s;h, indolent people, hardly equal to the &s;everity of the country and &s;ubject to many di&s;orders. And as to the pernicious effects of &s;pirituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coa&s;t of Guinea,) it is ob&s;erved, that the French and Portugue&s;e, who do not indulge in di&s;tilled &s;pirits, are healthy compared with the Engli&s;h; who, drinking freely of &s;pirits, &amp;c. die fa&s;t."</P>
<P>The unhappy dram-drinkers are &s;o ab&s;o|lutely bound in &s;lavery to the&s;e infernal &s;pi|rits, that they &s;eem to have lo&s;t the power of delivering them&s;elves from this wor&s;t of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of tho&s;e, who have it in their power to withhold this de&s;tructive man bane, either as parents, ma&s;ters, or rulers to the people committed to their tru&s;t. This is a ca&s;e &s;o calamitous to mankind, that to have a tho|rough &s;en&s;e of it, and yet not to remon&s;trate, nor earne&s;tly caution again&s;t it, is certainty as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind per&s;on of a dangerous precipice or pit. Yet, alas how unconcerned are the greate&s;t part of mankind at this enormous ruin of multitudes! In trials for life, what diligence is u&s;ed to find the occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s of one &s;ubject. What care will not a faithful Phy&s;ician be&s;tow for the pre&s;ervation of one life. How did the wi&s;e Romans honour

<P>The mi&s;taken u&s;e and grievous abu&s;e of rum and other di&s;tilled &s;pirits, in no ca&s;e appears more palpably than at the time of harve&s;t, a bu&s;ine&s;s which the people under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation were enjoined to carry on with humiliation and thank&s;giving; but which among&s;t us, through the free u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, is made an occa&s;ion of a greater abu&s;e of the creatures and di&s;ho|nour of the Creator; this ari&s;es in many, from a mi&s;taken per&s;ua&s;ion that hard labour, particularly that of the harve&s;t field, cannot be carried on without u&s;ing a quantity of rum or other di&s;tilled &s;pirits. In &s;upport of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died at tho&s;e times through the extream heat and fatigue, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that many more would die, if a plentiful u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors was not allowed; but this is a mi&s;taken notion, it being much more likely that the free u&s;e of rum occa&s;ioned the death of tho&s;e people, the quantity they had &s;wallowed down, &s;ending a great flow of &s;pirits into the head in pro|portion to the &s;trength of their body cau&s;ed them to &s;train their &s;trength beyond what nature could bear; and in general the re|peated large quantities of &s;pirit commonly

<P>The&s;e weighty con&s;iderations have induced &s;ome well minded people to endeavour to induce, by their examples, their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and un|der the&s;e attempts experience has made it manife&s;t that very little or no &s;trong liquor is nece&s;&s;ary at tho&s;e times; indeed they have been convinced that the harve&s;t, and other laborious work, can be very well managed without making u&s;e of any &s;pirituous liquors at all. If &s;uch labour was carried on with &s;teadine&s;s and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a recruit of &s;trength being &s;ought for by that means; more frequent intervals of re&s;t, with a little food oftener allowed the reapers, and &s;mall drinks, &s;uch as mola&s;&s;es and water, either alone or made more agreable with a little cyder, &s;mall beer, or even milk and water would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's &s;atisfaction and their own advantage, and the overplus wages they would receive to the value of the &s;pirits u&s;ually given them, might be &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e bread for their families. Several per&s;ons who from a per&s;ua&s;ion that the com|mon
<PB N="72" REF="016817_0072_0F9E7FA7F2ABC570">
method of giving &s;pirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with tho&s;e they have employ|ed, not to u&s;e any &s;pirituous liquors in their field; the&s;e have had their work performed to good &s;atisfaction and without any damage en&s;uing to their labourers. Nay, where they have remained any con&s;iderable time with &s;uch employers, they have generally acknowledged them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of the be|nefit ari&s;ing from having thus totally refrain|ed the u&s;e of tho&s;e liquors.</P>
<P>Should this practice take place, it would prove a great ble&s;&s;ing, particularly to the la|bouring people, one half of whom (a phy|&s;ician of this country hath given as his &s;en|timent) die &s;ooner than they otherwi&s;e would do, &s;olely by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. Be&s;ides, that it would di&s;courage the di&s;til|lation of rye and other grain; a practice which is not only a great hurt to the poor in rai&s;ing the price of bread, but mu&s;t al&s;o be very offen&s;ive to God the great and good father of the family of mankind, that people &s;hould, in their earthly and corrupt wi&s;dom, pervert their Maker's benevolent intention, in converting the grain he hath given to us as the &s;taff of life, unto a fiery &s;pirit, &s;o de|&s;tructive of the human frame and attended with the other dreadful con&s;equences alrea|dy mentioned. Here it may be noted, that any quantity of good mola&s;&s;es will by di&s;til|lation, yield more than the &s;ame quantity of

proof &s;pirit. And that a con&s;iderable quan|tity of mola&s;&s;es if taken with bread at one time, as the Indians will &s;ometimes do, will not intoxicate, the &s;pirituous parts in the mola&s;&s;es being properly united by our good and wi&s;e creator with the earthly and bal&s;a|mick parts, &s;o as to make it quite friendly to our nature; but when by di&s;tilation the &s;pirituous parts are &s;eparated from the other parts, that mea&s;ure of &s;pirits proceeding from the &s;ame quantity of mola&s;&s;es, becomes a fiery liquid, de&s;tructive of the human frame.

This, tho' a common is a very erronous notion, men who never ta&s;ted &s;trong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but al&s;o live much longer than tho&s;e who u&s;e them daily. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The few of tho&s;e who notwith&s;tanding their ex|ce&s;s in drinking &s;pirituous liquors, from the uncom|mon &s;trength of their con&s;titution, may have attained to con&s;iderable age, would doubtle&s;s have lived much longer if they had lived temperate lives.</NOTE> But &s;uppo&s;e &s;trong liquors did enable a man to do more work, they mu&s;t never|thele&s;s wa&s;te the powers of life, and of cour&s;e occa&s;ion premature old age.

At page the &s;ame author tells us, that all intoxicating liquors may be con&s;idered as poi&s;ons. However di&s;gui&s;|ed, that is their real character, and &s;ooner or later they will have their effect.</Q></P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;everal prejudices in favour of the mi&s;taken u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, there is none gives it a greater &s;anction or &s;upport, than the prevailing opinion, even with per&s;ons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t liquor that can be drank; hence confirming the opini|on, that &s;pirit in one form or other is nece&s;|&s;ary To &s;uch who have not been accu&s;tom|ed, and think they cannot habituate them|&s;elves to drink water, there may appear to be &s;ome kind of plea in this argument, e&s;pecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented liquors that are dead, hard, &s;our, or not properly fer|mented, which tend to generate air in the bowels, produceing colicks, &amp;c. But if tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;uffered the weight of the &s;ub|ject, and the encouragement they thereby give to the u&s;e of the&s;e de&s;tructive &s;pirits, to take proper place with them, it might &s;ugge&s;t the propriety, if not nece&s;&s;ity of in|troducing a more &s;alutary practice.</P>
<P>That pure fluid (water) which the benevo|lent father of the family of mankind, points

out for general u&s;e, is &s;o analogous to the human frame, that people might with &s;afety gradually u&s;e them&s;elves to it. Dr. Cheyne ob&s;erves, that without all doubt, water is the primitive original beverage, as it is the only &s;imple fluid fitted for diluting, moi&s;ten|ing and cooling; the ends of drink, appoint|ed by nature, and he adds happy had it been for the race of mankind, if other mix|ed and artificial liquors had never been in|vented. Water alone is &s;ufficient and effec|tual for all the purpo&s;es of human want in drink: Strong liquors were never de&s;igned for common u&s;e. Speaking of the effect of wine, which he &s;ays to have been &s;o much in u&s;e at the time he wrote, that the better &s;ort of people &s;carcely diluted their food with any other liquor, he remarks,
<Q>That as natural cau&s;es will always produce their proper effects, their blood was in|flamed into gout, &s;tone, and rheumati&s;m, raging fevers, pleuri&s;ies, &amp;c. Water is the only di&s;olvent or men&s;truum, and the mo&s;t certain diluter of all bodies proper for food.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Short, in his di&s;cour&s;e of the in|ward u&s;e of water, &s;peaks much in its com|mendation. He &s;ays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excellency of water, from the longevity and healthfulne&s;s of tho&s;e who at fir&s;t had no better liquor, and the health and &s;trength of body and &s;erenity of mind, of tho&s;e who at this day
<PB N="76" REF="016817_0076_0F9E7FAAF4D42F68">
have no other common liquor to drink, of this the common people among&s;t the Highlands of Scotland, are a &s;ufficient in|&s;tance, among&s;t whom it is no rarity to find per&s;ons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy &s;trong and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty &s;ix or forty. The Doctor &s;ays, There is a ridicul|ous maxim u&s;ed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;ay, &s;ays he, it is water only that can en|duce its drinkers with the &s;tronge&s;t bodies and mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions, where exerci&s;e or labour is joined with it, &s;ince it be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ts the &s;tomach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the &s;malle&s;t particles, that they may better pa&s;s the &s;trainers of the body, which &s;eparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;els, and exerci&s;e invigorates the &s;ibres and mu&s;cles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood ex|cited by drinking &s;pirituous liquors, cannot fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cau&s;e the watery parts to di&s;&s;ipate, and the remaining to grow thick and tough, and the event be ob&s;tructions, inflammations, impo&s;t-humations, &amp;c.&mdash;and tho' &s;trong liquors af|ford a greater &s;low of &s;pirits for a &s;hort time, yet this is always followed with as much lowne&s;s of &s;pirit; &s;o that to gain a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tock of &s;pirits, the per&s;on is obliged to re|peat the &s;ame force, till he learns a cu&s;tom of drinking drams. In this we are confirm|ed,

if we con&s;ider the great &s;trength and hardine&s;s of poor ru&s;ticks in many parts of the world, who&s;e provi&s;ions is mo&s;tly veget|able food, and their drink water. The doc|tor adds, that it often happens that per&s;ons of tender, weakly, crazy con&s;titutions, by refraining from &s;trong liquors and accu&s;tom|ing them&s;elves to drink water, make a &s;hift to &s;pin out many years.</P>
<P>After de&s;cribing the many di&s;tempers pro|duced by drinking malt or other fermented liquors he adds, that &s;eeing con&s;titutions differ, it is not to be expected that &s;pirituous liquors &s;hould produce all the &s;ame &s;ymp|toms in one and the &s;ame per&s;on, yet that all drinkers have &s;everal of them; and if they come not to that height, its becau&s;e they afterwards u&s;e great exerci&s;e or hard labour, with &s;ometimes thin diluting liquors, which prevent their immediate hurting.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to &s;uch well di&s;po&s;ed people, who &s;till retain a favourable opinion of the u&s;e of &s;pirits mixed with water, ought they not, even from a love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from it, on account of the effect their example may have in encou|raging others in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous, liquors, agreeable to the example left us by the apo&s;tle Paul, 1 Cor. viii. 13. <HI>If meat make my bro|ther to offend I will eat no fle&s;h while the world &s;tands, le&s;t I make my brother to offend.</HI> How much more ought they to refrain from that which tends to e&s;tabli&s;h mankind, in a prac|tice

&s;o generally de&s;tructive, more e&s;pecially when they con&s;ider the danger them&s;elves are in of encrea&s;ing the quantity of &s;pirit with their water, as it has been ob&s;erved, that the u&s;e of this mixture is particularly apt, almo&s;t imperceptible to gain upon tho&s;e that u&s;e it, &s;o that many otherwi&s;e good and judicious people have unwarily to them&s;elves and others, fallen, with the common herd, a &s;acrifice to this mighty devourer.</P>
<P>A very eminent phy&s;ician has given the following direction, for the benefit of tho&s;e who have not wi&s;dom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, <HI>viz.</HI> By degrees to mix water with the &s;pirit, to le&s;&s;en the quantity every day, and keep to the &s;ame quantity of water, till in about the cour&s;e of a week, nothing of the dram kind be u&s;ed along with water. By this means the per&s;on will &s;uffer no inconveniency, but reap great benefit upon leaving off drams or &s;pirits as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the &s;tomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of &s;ervice. The appetite always increa&s;es in a few days after leaving off drams, unle&s;s by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed. And when the &s;to|mach is thus affected a cup of carduus, ca|momile wormwood or centaury tea, every morning fa&s;ting and every evening will be found a good remedy.</P>
