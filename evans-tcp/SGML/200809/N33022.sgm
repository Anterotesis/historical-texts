<Q>And the land &s;hall mourn, every family apart.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My COUNTRYMEN and BRETHERN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MUST America be the unhappy people, as it were, the Jews rai&s;ed from the dead to perpe|trate the &s;ame wickedne&s;s over again, but under greater light, that our ruin in the end may be &s;till more com|pleat, and our condemnation, like that of Capernaum at the day of judgment, be &s;even fold enhanced!</P>
<P>WE &s;ee that while the calls of GOD to repentance wax louder, the cry of our &s;abbath-breaking, &s;wearing, uncleane&s;s, and many other &s;ins, waxes louder and louder, and like the cry of Sodom comes up before GOD: And HE is now come down in his righteous judgment among us, and pleads again&s;t us, for the abu&s;es we of|fer to his bleeding Son, who is crucified in every un|believing heart.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall we do? We cannot &s;tand before his anger! Shall du&s;t magnify it&s;elf again&s;t him that tread|eth thereon? Or the chaff again&s;t the wind? Or the dry &s;tubble again&s;t the raging flames?</P>
<P>LET us then, every family and every per&s;on, mourn apart for our &s;ins. Let each one, with him&s;elf, cry 
<PB N="4" REF="043342_0003_101D041F08D477B0">
Alas! Alas for my &s;ins!&mdash;How much have I done to pull down the judgments of GOD upon the land!&mdash;O how did I &s;in!&mdash;How was my &s;in aggravated!&mdash;How did I &s;in wilfully!&mdash;Again&s;t my own con&s;cience, again&s;t examples, again&s;t many warnings and admonitions, a|gain&s;t mercies and again&s;t judgments, and after vows made in &s;ickne&s;s and in danger; how have I re&s;trained prayer, abu&s;ed &s;abbaths, neglected GOD's word, di&s;pi&s;|ed his people, pierced his Son and grieved his Holy Spirlt! Oh! How have I ob&s;erved lying vanities and for&s;aken mine own mercies!</P>
<P>LET con&s;cience, &s;he is one of thy be&s;t friends, let con&s;cience now have full &s;cope, and range with freedom through all thy life, and bring up every &s;in, and place it before thee in its blacke&s;t colours, as it would appear to thee if thou wer't now upon thy death bed.</P>
<P>Nay, let con&s;cience dive into the heart and &s;earch e|very corner of it; and pray GOD to &s;earch you and to &s;hew you more and more the blackne&s;s, the filthine&s;s and turpitude of your own heart. There &s;ee your con|trariety to GOD, your unreconciledne&s;s to his ways, your di&s;affection to his holine&s;s. View your heart in the gla&s;s of GOD's perfect word;&mdash;view it as di&s;cribed in Matthew xv. 19.</P>
<P>VIEW it as the &s;eat of pride, malice, hypocri&s;y, un|belief, covetou&s;ne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality; view it as the foun|tain, as the &s;ea of Sodom, from whence all the &s;treams of wickedne&s;s flow.&mdash;View the &s;ins of your life, view them over again and again; let them be continually be|fore you; but the heart like an ocean &s;wallows them all;&mdash;view the evil of them e&s;pecially as they are again&s;t a GOD of infinite purity and excellence. Let us view them as the thorns, the nails and the &s;pear that pierced the LORD of life.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="043342_0004_101D0421A1BC4AA0">
VIEW the ju&s;t damand's of GOD's all-perfect law,&mdash;<HI>The &s;oul that &s;ineth it &s;hall die,</HI> Ezekiel xviii. 4. View the rottenne&s;s of your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;ins of your be&s;t &s;ervices, and be humbled under your moral inabili|ty to help your&s;elves.</P>
<P>AND when you have wandered up and down in &s;elf, and in the world, &s;eeking help of creatures, and have found none, come to JESUS CHRIST, he can help when all others fail. He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t. Come to him; thou&s;ands reject him and are damned; but come ye to this infinitely glorious SAVIOUR, and prove his excellence.</P>
<P>THE Greeks came to him at the fea&s;t; Nichodemas came to him; the Cyrophenician woman came to him, thou&s;ands have come to him mi&s;erable as you are, and not one that cometh will be ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>Do you &s;ay if he were upon earth as he was once, you would come to him?&mdash;I tell you JESUS CHRIST is even now upon earth by his word and &s;pirit; he is here in his humble form by his witne&s;&s;es and people, and ble&s;&s;ed are they who are not offended in him: Verily you may now come to him in a manner that is as plea&s;ing to him, and as &s;aving to you, as if you had beheld him and come to him in the days of his fle&s;h upon earth.</P>
<P>O COME to him; come now; come as you are; come beggars; come with all your &s;ins, blindne&s;s, poverty and di&s;grace, ca&s;t your&s;elves at his feet. He, the glori|ous LAMB of GOD, invites you, &s;aying come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</P>
<P>IF you think you are even as black as the blacke&s;t in hell, come and be married to the PRINCE of LIFE. Come, experience the efficacy of his all purifying blood, 
<PB N="6" REF="043342_0005_101D04242B8D6230">
which never failed to clean&s;e the blacke&s;t; no not Mary Magdalen, a per&s;ecuting Saul, or a thief on the cro&s;s. But it may be, one &s;ay's, I am wor&s;e than any of the&s;e, I have &s;inned beyond them! Well, dear heart, what then? What if you are legion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a legion of devils? Don't let us di&s;tru&s;t CHRIST's &s;ufficiency or his willing|ne&s;s; he is &s;tronger than the &s;trong man armed; he conquers hell and death, and &s;houts his victories. Di&s;|pair not; thank GOD that he has begun to open your eyes, while others are going blindfold to hell.</P>
<P>BE not weary of your &s;adne&s;s, while the laughter, the &s;coffing and mirth of fools is like the crackling of thorns under a pot&mdash;You now &s;orrow and they rejoice; but it is po&s;&s;ible, if you grieve not the holy &s;pirit, that you may yet rejoice when they may &s;orrow without hope. Think how intollerable hell would be, were it only to dwell forever with thine own un&s;anctified &s;elf, under the reigning power of thine unre&s;training pa&s;&s;ions, hav|ing an accu&s;ing con&s;cience, that worm which dieth not, forever praying like a vulture upon thine heart&s;trings. Every man is born and brought up with the &s;eeds of hell in him 'till grace &s;ubdues them.</P>
<P>As you would not endure this; as you would not endure the wrath of Almighty GOD, with devils in the flaming regions of endle&s;s di&s;pair; and as you would obtain pardon, peace, joy, bli&s;s and glory above, come to JE|SUS CHRIST for all that you need.</P>
<P>COME to him for teaching; he is a glorious teacher come from GOD; lie at his feet; confe&s;&s; your &s;ins; make re&s;titution to tho&s;e you have injured; forgive your enemy from the heart; and as you forgive, pray GOD, for CHRIST's &s;ake, to forgive you.</P>
<P>THUS come to JESUS CHRIST to have &s;ins pardoned, guilt removed, lu&s;ts and corruptions &s;ubdued, grace and &s;trength communicated.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="043342_0006_101D0426073B7C78">
RENOUNCE the world, the fle&s;h and the devil, give up your&s;elf, your all, to GOD, in JESUS CHRIST, to be his entirely, to do or to &s;uffer whatever he calls you to in life, tru&s;ting in his merits alone for the acceptance of your per&s;ons and &s;ervices.</P>
<P>THESE are the terms of divine favour to every per|&s;on; O how glorious! How infinitely rea&s;onable our compliance! GOD does not require us to inve&s;tigate the number of fixed &s;tars, or to track the blazing comet, but <HI>that we believe on him whom he hath &s;ent.</HI> Here is peace, if all the world are at odds, and &s;afety, if the heavens and earth be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>BUT for us to continue &s;tupid and &s;ecure in this day, is more awful than the judgments we feel, being a &s;urer foreboder of ruin. In this &s;en&s;e, <HI>quos deus vult perdere prius dementat.</HI> O madne&s;s without parallel, and ruin without remedy!</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, my countrymen and brethren,</HI></P>
<P>LET us no longer, like the Jews, mock the great Je|hovah with our hypocritical &s;hews, as we have often done, for he looks at the inward part: Therefore let us repent and turn unto him with all our heart, if perad|venture the LORD may yet turn from his fierce anger, that is kindled again&s;t us, and be a pre&s;ent help in time of need. Let us not be deceived; GOD is not mocked. But let us, O land, repent indeed of our &s;ins, of our profanene&s;s, of our drunkenne&s;s, of our un|cleanne&s;s, of our &s;abbath-breaking, of our inju&s;tice, of our covetou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion, of our neglect of fa|mily and other devotions; let us repent and mourn for our horrid abu&s;e of the glorious go&s;pel and the greate&s;t privileges that ever a nation enjoyed. And, in the matter of oppre&s;&s;ion, do not the thing that thou condemne&s;t in another, knowing that with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again, Matthew, vii, 2. For the&s;e &s;ins our fields have more than once &s;moaked with the blood of our young men; many wives are now be|come widows, and many children are become fatherle&s;s, 
<PB N="8" REF="043342_0007_101D0427C9D03118">
and thou&s;ands of our brethren are &s;lain, or wounded, or carried into captivity.</P>
<P>WHEREAS we all, mini&s;ters, rulers and people, have by our &s;ins procured this, let us all as one man unite in repenting and turning unto the LORD. Let every family and every per&s;on mourn apart, and no longer, by provoking GOD, go on to plunge the fatal &s;teel into the bo&s;oms of our dear ones. What I &s;ay to one, I &s;ay to all. Let every parent and every child, every town and every &s;ociety, cry to GOD for his help, &s;ending up every prayer in the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Pray in public, pray in your families, in your clo&s;ets, or in the fields; pray with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, pray and faint not. Let ince&s;&s;ent fervent prayers be a&s;cending up to GOD from all parts of the land, that he, in his infinite love and mercy, will ap|pear for us, and cau&s;e his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit to be poured out that we may be awakened to a thorough reformation; and that GOD would &s;ave us when we have no might to &s;ave our&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>But to tho&s;e who in this day frolick and carou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>MY FRIENDS, though you forget your &s;ins, yet re|member your &s;ins will not forget you: If you fly from them they will follow you, as the &s;hadow doth its &s;ub|&s;tance; and no di&s;tance or time, nor change of place, can alter or efface them. While you murder time at your revels, con&s;cience behind the door minutes even your thoughts, and her black bill is now repo&s;ited in &s;tore again&s;t you, which death will &s;oon read;&mdash;he, the end of all your mirth, is now at the door, and hell follows with him. O what a change is at hand! Now you dance to the violin; then you mu&s;t dance to death's pipe. Now the &s;parks of lu&s;t kindle, then the fire of hell burns. Now you &s;in in je&s;t; then GOD damns in earne&s;t. Now you bark at the word; then you howl at your&s;elves.</P>
<P>O be wi&s;e; for what is a &s;and to the globe; a drop to the ocean; a &s;unbeam to its fountain, and a &s;hort life of mirth to eternal pain.</P>
