<P>And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life eternal.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this chapter our Saviour di&s;cour&s;es of his &s;econd coming to judge the world, when all mu&s;t appear before him, to hear and receive their final &s;en|tence. Now from the 31&s;t to the 46th ver&s;e, he tells us more plainly and particularly, how and with what wi&s;dom and equity, the judgment will proceed, and after &s;entence is awarded according to the ju&s;t de|&s;ert, or demerit of all good and bad; execution will be taken out and levelled on all accordingly, as in our text&mdash;"And the&s;e (the wicked) &s;hall go away into ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life eternal." The&s;e words are &s;o plain and expre&s;s at fir&s;t view, that they need but little explanation. The &s;cope and de|&s;ign of them is, to repre&s;ent to us the different &s;tates of good and bad men in the other world, and that their
<PB N="4" REF="017829_0003_0FB81A7E60ACAB78">
end, or &s;tate there, will be as different as their ways and doings have been here in this world, which certainly are matters of the highe&s;t concernment, to be well con|&s;idered by us in this our only probation &s;ea&s;on, for one or the other of the&s;e &s;tates which are, or will be unal|terable forever. In a word, we are plainly here taught tho&s;e two &s;oul concerning propo&s;itions, viz.</P>
<P>Propo&s;ition fir&s;t. THAT good men, or all the God|ly, &s;hall be eternally happy in the other world.</P>
<P>Prop. 2d. THAT wicked men, or all the ungodly, &s;hall be eternally puni&s;hed for their &s;ins in the other world.</P>
<P>MANKIND &s;eem to be willing enough to acknowledge the truth of this fir&s;t propo&s;ition, hoping to &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of it; but many for want of this go&s;pel hope, have a great aver&s;ion to this &s;econd propo&s;ition, and are unwilling it &s;hould be true, or be received for truth, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked &s;hould be eternal, and have their objections and cavils again&s;t the truth of it: but it ought to be ob&s;erved, that if the glorifi|cation of the &s;aints in heaven is eternal, &s;o is the pu|ni&s;hment of them that peri&s;h; for the&s;e are in exact oppo&s;ition and &s;ame mea&s;ure of time. But more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>As the great difficulty lies with re&s;pect to the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, which is denied by &s;ome ('tis hoped not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> among us) I &s;hall therefore begin with that
<PB N="5" REF="017829_0004_0FB81A81014D34C8">
fir&s;t, and endeavour to prove that the doctrine of the eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked in the other world, is a true, ju&s;t, and rea&s;onable doctrine, plainly and fully taught us in God's &s;acred oracles. Here there|fore we &s;hall &s;hew the&s;e two things.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT it is a doctrine clearly, fully and plainly taught us by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT it is a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable doctrine, wor|thy the ble&s;&s;ed author of it, and greatly beneficial to mankind in many re&s;pects, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Prop. 1&s;t. WE &s;ay, that this doctrine of eternal re|wards and puni&s;hments, is a doctrine clearly, fully and plainly taught us by Chri&s;t him&s;elf in the &s;acred &s;crip|tures; and for the illu&s;tration of this, let us look back to the foundation: when God created our fir&s;t parents innocent and holy, to warn them to continue in their obedience and fealty to God, death was threatened as the immediate con&s;equence of &s;in, "in the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die," or dy|ing thou &s;halt die a continual everla&s;ting death. They di&s;obeying incured the penalty on them&s;elves and po&s;terity; and hence God determined what the effect of &s;in &s;hould ever be&mdash;The &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die&mdash;The wicked &s;hall be turned into hell with all the nations that forget God. In the new Te&s;tament we are more fully told what hell is, viz. a lake burning with fire and brim&s;tone&mdash;and the &s;moke of their tor|ment
<PB N="6" REF="017829_0005_0FB81A826F6B01F0">
a&s;&s;endeth forever and ever; and as the&s;e torments are intollerable, &s;o they are eternal and never cea&s;ing, into which our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, that the wicked &s;hall be ca&s;t in the other world. So in our text, "and the&s;e (viz. the wicked) &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment," and in Mat. xxviii. 41. "Depart from me ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels," chap. xviii. 8. "where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched"&mdash;Rev. xx. 10. "and &s;hall be tormented forever and ever"&mdash;and in Mark, chap. 9. 'tis three times over, &s;everally and very pathetical|ly a&s;&s;erted by our Saviour, that "their worm dieth not and fire is not quenched." And what &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of tho&s;e that know not God, nor obey the go&s;pel of his Son? Why "they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and for the glory of his power." 2 The&s;&s;. i. 9. Now how full, how clear, how perfectly agreeing with the&s;e &s;criptures for affirming this doctrine, of the eternal re|wards of the Godly, and eternal puni&s;hment of the wicked in the other world; nor can there be one text produced in all the book of God, that gives any real intimation, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked who continue ob&s;tinate in &s;in, to the end of this life; that the puni&s;hment of &s;uch in the other world, &s;hall ever have an end, or mittigation. The Athie&s;t &s;ays there is no God; but can never prove it. The Dei&s;t denies the &s;criptures of the old and new Te&s;tament, to be a
<PB N="7" REF="017829_0006_0FB81A83E2847CA0">
divine revelation from God; but can no more prove it than the Athie&s;t can what he affirms. And ju&s;t &s;o it is with them that deny the eternity of hell torments, they cannot prove what they would fain per&s;uade them|&s;elves and others to believe; but 'tis a negative propo|&s;ition incapable of proof.</P>
<P>Prop. 2d. WE &s;ay and affirm, that this is a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable doctrine, worthy the ble&s;&s;ed author of it, and greatly beneficial to the good and be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind in many re&s;pects, &amp;c. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, we &s;hall endeavour to prove and make evident&mdash;and then con&s;ider &s;uch obejections, or cavils, as are, or may be made again&s;t this true, plain and &s;cripture doc|trine which we a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>HERE then let the following arguments be &s;eriou&s;ly and impartially con&s;idered&mdash;as 1&s;t. That the belief of this doctrine is really beneficial and nece&s;&s;ary, and for the good of mankind; as 'tis a nece&s;&s;ary proper check and re&s;traint on the unruly lu&s;ts, corrupti|ons, and exorbitant pa&s;&s;ions of mankind in this corrupt fallen &s;tate. 'Tis wonderful to ob&s;erve, what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on the world, the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, has got of men's heart, i. e. the &s;trong appetite corrupt nature has, for indulging fle&s;hly plea&s;ures, the lu&s;t of the eye after gain and riches, rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. and the pride of life, i. e. the &s;trong in|&s;atiable thir&s;t after honor, pomp, grandure, and a vain|glorious
<PB N="8" REF="017829_0007_0FB81A8C77005A50">
life. What will not men do? What ri&s;ks wont they run? Yea, many times not &s;tick at the mo&s;t cruel and &s;hameful barbarities to gratify tho&s;e in&s;atia|ble cravings of carnal, corrupt nature, that mu&s;t be o|beyed again&s;t the plain dictates of rea&s;on, be the con|&s;equence what it will; as Jere. ii. 25. "Thou &s;aide&s;t there is no hope: no, for I have loved &s;trangers, and after them will I go." And is it &s;o? Dont mankind then &s;tand in need of &s;ome powerful re&s;traint, to check the&s;e &s;o di&s;orderly lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, without which all manner of rapine, inju&s;tice and confu&s;ion mu&s;t take place, and men be like wolves and tygers to devour one another? Nor can any means be a&s;&s;igned &s;o proper, and power to an&s;wer the end in this ca&s;e, as the doc|trine of future, eternal rewards and puni&s;hments. Tem|porary puni&s;hments, or evils, are too weak for an&s;|wering the&s;e great ends, of re&s;training and curbing the exorbitant lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of carnal and corrupt nature, and that becau&s;e they are temporary and &s;oon at an end, and the &s;inner may think and pur&s;uade him|&s;elf, that he &s;hall &s;urely outlive the&s;e temporary puni&s;h|ments, for infinite ages in bli&s;s and glory. But the apprehen&s;ion of being eternally mi&s;erable in the other world, &s;trikes a dread on human nature, and becomes a powerful re&s;traint from &s;in. For who can bear the thought of dwelling with devouring fire, and everla&s;t|ing burnings, without horror? Hence how fit, how wi&s;e, how nece&s;&s;ary and proper was it, for the good of
<PB N="9" REF="017829_0008_0FB81A8E632FC060">
mankind in the legi&s;lature, to guard and enforce obe|dience to his ju&s;t laws, by annexing eternal rewards to the obedience of merit and demerit, &s;ince no other means could be powerful enough to attain the end. Nor can any thing be imagined more intolerably painful than &s;uffering the violence of fire adjutated with brim|&s;tone, fitly expre&s;&s;ed to warn men from &s;in; a metaphor frequently u&s;ed by our Saviour, in his preaching when on earth to this end, and Apo&s;tles followed this &s;ame example in their preaching to the &s;ame end, for the warning and good of mankind. 2 Cor, v. 11. "Know|ing the terrors of the Lord, we per&s;uade men." In a word, &s;uch a re&s;traint of all evil, and promoter of all peace, and promoter of all good both in church and &s;tate, is this doctrine of eternal rewards and puni&s;h|ments, (that if we had not &s;o full an evidence of the truth of it as we have) yet were it to be de&s;ired, that all men &s;hould believe it, for the va&s;t good, peace and benefit, both of individuals and communities.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE belief of this doctrine will more e&s;pecially appear to be for the good and benefit of mankind, if we con&s;ider the &s;afety and &s;upport it yields in times of trouble and danger. What have we to &s;upport and comfort us, under all the hard things and evil &s;ufferings that befal us in this &s;tate of life; (for which in many ca&s;es we have no remedy here) but that of our Saviour, that if we &s;uffer with him, that we may be glorified to|gether? This is the only or principle &s;upport that good
<PB N="10" REF="017829_0009_0FB81A8FE2926720">
men have under all the unju&s;t &s;ufferings, evils, and hard treatment, that befal them in this life. That there is a judgment approaching on the other &s;ide death, when all the&s;e wrong things &s;hall be righted, and every man receive a full and ju&s;t reward according to what his con|duct has been in this life of trial: hence that of 1 Cor. xv. 19. "If in this life only we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable." But here is the &s;ure remedy and cure of this evil, that God will fully con|&s;ider all the pains any of us have taken in his &s;ervice, or &s;uffered for his cau&s;e, and all the difficulties which we have &s;truggled with, out of love to God; virtue and religion, and &s;uch good works, &s;hall be eternally re|warded of grace, not of debt. Hence, "Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead that die in the Lord, they re&s;t from their la|bour, and their works do follow them."</P>
<P N="3">III. THE wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, as well as ju&s;tice of God, are to be &s;een and acknowledged in appointing the&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments, and making them eter|nal for the warning and detering men from &s;in, the ex|citing and encouraging men to obedience, virtue and holine&s;s. The primary de&s;ign of annexing eternal pu|ni&s;hment to &s;in, wilfully and perver&s;ely continued in through this &s;tate of life, is not to puni&s;h, but rather to &s;ave from puni&s;hment, by warning them of the danger, and detering men from tho&s;e &s;inful practices, and &s;uch a wicked life as &s;urely brings on inevitable mi&s;ery and de&s;truction at la&s;t. Hence the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of
<PB N="11" REF="017829_0010_0FB81A959299A860">
the legi&s;ture appear, in annexing &s;uch degree of puni&s;h|ment to &s;in, as may over-ballance the &s;trong di&s;po&s;iti|ons and temptations, men have to commit and conti|nue in the practice of &s;in. The law is good, and can never hurt us, if we dont hurt our&s;elves by di&s;obeying of it. It lays no re&s;traints upon us, but what is for our own good and benefit; nor does God threaten men, that they may &s;in and be puni&s;hed; no, but that they may e&s;cape the puni&s;hment; therefore, the higher the threatening runs, &s;o much the more mercy and good|ne&s;s there is in it, becau&s;e it is &s;o much the more like|ly to re&s;train them from incurring the penalty that is threatened, and if it fails of this good effect, the fault is wholly our own.</P>
<P N="4">IV. WAS it not fit, rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary to en|force man's obedience to the laws of his Maker? That God &s;hould annex &s;uch rewards and puni&s;hments as were fit and proper to an&s;wer that end, and their be|ing made eternal was nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer that end, even by the repeated conce&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t learned of the Dei&s;tical writers them&s;elves, (and this corrupt doctrine we are oppo&s;ing, is much the &s;ame with their's) giving &s;uch high incomiums to Chri&s;tia|nity, her con&s;titution, rights, orders, &s;acrament, laws, &amp;c. obliged thereto, by the light of truth, their own rea&s;on and con&s;cience, though enemies to divine re|velation. So Lord Herbit pronounces of the divine
<PB N="12" REF="017829_0011_0FB81A9890A11868">
laws, ordinances, &amp;c. of divine revelation, as enforced by eternal rewards and puni&s;hments, that it is the be&s;t religion: that all its doctrines, precepts, &s;acraments, aim at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e five important arti|cles, in which he makes all religion to con&s;i&s;t. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, p. <HI>9, 10.</HI></NOTE> Doct.

<P>Mr. Chub acknowledges the &s;ame. Po&s;thumous-works, vol. <HI>2.</HI> p. <HI>370.</HI></P></NOTE> The moral philo&s;opher frequently expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. And Mr. Chub acknowledges that Chri&s;tianity, if it could be &s;eparated from every thing that is blended with it, yields a much clearer light, and is a more &s;afe guide to mankind, than any other tradi|tionary religion, as being better adapted to improve and perfect human nature. Lord Bolingbroke, their champion, repre&s;ent Chri&s;tianity as a mo&s;t amiable and u&s;eful in&s;titution, and that its natural tendency is to promote the peace and happine&s;s of mankind; that the &s;y&s;tem of religion it teaches, is a complete &s;y&s;|tem to all the purpo&s;es of religion, natural and reveal|ed.
<PB N="13" REF="017829_0012_0FB81A99AEA6BBD8">
And in another place repre&s;ents, that the &s;y&s;tem of religion which Chri&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and his Evangeli&s;ts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, is a complete &s;y&s;tem to all the purpo&s;es of re|ligion, natural and revealed. And again adds, that &s;uppo&s;ing Chri&s;tianity to have been an human inventi|on, it had been the mo&s;t amiable, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful invention, that ever was impo&s;ed on mankind for their good, and often to the &s;ame purpo&s;e el&s;ewhere. Why then do they not adhere to this excellent divine con&s;ti|tution? Why the rea&s;ons they give us, are thus truly confe&s;&s;ed by them&s;elves, viz. becau&s;e they cannot bear the re&s;traints that (that go&s;pel, or true religion) lays upon their corrupt lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions. The real end they aim at, is expre&s;&s;ed by one of them&s;elves, to &s;ave a &s;oul from the di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of eternal damnation, to relea&s;e a per&s;on from labouring under that unea&s;ine&s;s of mind which often he is under, when plea&s;ure and Chri&s;tianity come in competition. And Lord Boling|broke mentions it as an advantage of the way of think|ing, he recommends, that the burning lake will then di&s;appear. And one man &s;aid that he found this go&s;pel preaching made a hell in a man's con&s;cience. In a word, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee whence the minds of determined &s;inners come to be filled with &s;uch unrea&s;onable preju|dices again&s;t divine revelation.</P>
<P N="5">V. WE add as a further argument; 'tis utterly im|po&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing, that a man living
<PB N="14" REF="017829_0013_0FB81A9B4A8C64C8">
and dying in his &s;ins &s;hould be happy, or enjoy heaven which he cannot be capable of; becau&s;e a &s;inful na|ture, and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, will ever make a man mi&s;erable in him&s;elf, be he where he will, in this world or the next: as it was with Adam and Eve in Paradi&s;e, on their fall; though they were created perfectly inno|cent, holy and happy, yet immediately on their &s;inning, they lo&s;t all their peace and happine&s;s, and fell under amazing fear and terror, and vainly &s;trove to hide them&s;elves from God; as not able to bear the &s;ight of God their Maker. Sin and unpardoned guilt will ever produce the like effect: 'tis the gnawing worm in the brea&s;t that never dies; it makes &s;inners tremble at the thoughts of appearing before God: hence the wicked man travels in pain all his days, is always &s;ubject to fear and inward unea&s;ine&s;s. In a word, he that is a &s;lave to &s;in can't but be a &s;lave to fear; hence is like the troubled &s;ea that cannot re&s;t, con&s;equently can have no true peace in this world, or in the next. Job, xxxiv. 29. "When he giveth quietne&s;s, who then can give trouble? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?" Whether it be done again&s;t a nation, or again&s;t a man only.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AS without holine&s;s, and the removal of guilt from the con&s;cience by pardon, the &s;inner cannot &s;ee God, nor enjoy peace, or happine&s;s, were he in heaven; &s;o no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary &s;anctifying change can be obtain|ed

on the other &s;ide death, or in the other world; and con&s;equently no &s;uch &s;inner dying in his &s;ins, can ever go to heaven to all eternity; for as the tree falls &s;o it lies; as death leaves us, &s;o judgment will find us, in the &s;ame &s;tate of guilt and &s;in, and pa&s;s &s;entence on us according|ly.

<P N="7">VII. MANKIND in this &s;tate, are probationers and on trial for an endle&s;s eternity of happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, and God has a&s;&s;ured them that their wages &s;hall be ac|cording to their works whether good, or evil.</P>
<P>HE that &s;ows to the fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap cor|ruption; but he that &s;ows to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life everla&s;ting, Gal. vi. 8.

"and he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal." Rom. vi. 22. "For the wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life."

What rea&s;on then can the &s;uffering &s;inner have to complain, when he has but his own choice, for, in chu&s;eing the means and way, he cho&s;e the end and receives but the ju&s;t wages, he had been labouring for through his whole life of trial, according to that of the Apo&s;tle 2 The&s;&s;a. i. 6, 7, 8, 9.

<P N="1">I. THAT the demerit of &s;in con&s;i&s;ts, not in the &s;addenne&s;s of the act or &s;hortne&s;s of the life of &s;in, but in the malignity of it, its exceeding &s;infullne&s;s in its nature, its incorrigible determined rebellion again&s;t God and his holy laws.

then no &s;hort degree of puni&s;hment can be adequate here.</P>
<P>SIN may appear &s;mall in its fir&s;t act and yet be very awful and malignant in its exten&s;ive con&s;equences. The manner of Adams offence &s;eemed &s;mall, yet the di&s;obedience was emmen&s;ely great; it being the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of that command which was given to be the in|&s;tance and proof of man's &s;ubjection to God, in the breath of which command the maje&s;ty and honour of the whole law were violated; and how great and awful the effects of this &s;in to this day.&mdash; So murder is a &s;hort, and &s;udden act, but awful and la&s;ting the guilt and effect of it, reaching down to the great judgement day, yea, to eternity unle&s;s repentance and pardon be ob|tained in this life.&mdash;Again, that mo&s;t horrible murder and &s;uicide, lately committed at Wetherfield, the mo&s;t wicked father, &s;laying his four children, and their mother, his wife and then him&s;elf, all which was &s;ud|denly perpetrated, likely in le&s;s then half an hour; but how great and la&s;ting the guilt, and the effect reach|ing down not only to the great judgement day; but doubtle&s;s to eternity.</P>
<P N="2">II. CONSIDER the Angels that &s;inned, who va&s;tly excelled us in nature, &s;trength and knowledge while holy: how did God deal with them, for one &s;in, the fir&s;t &s;in though indeed va&s;tly great and heinous, con|&s;idering

the perfect nature God had given them, the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate they were in enjoying as much happine&s;s, as their nature was capable of, yet to rebel, to rebel in heaven, renounce their &s;ealty to God, di&s;pi&s;e his authority, contemn his goodne&s;s, &amp;c. How greatly mu&s;t this encrea&s;e their guilt, and how ju&s;tly did God, for this one &s;in, this one &s;o great act of rebellion, thun|der them down out of heaven into hell, and &s;hut them up under chains of darkne&s;s, to be re&s;erved, to the judgement of the great day, and then to be more clo&s;ely &s;hut up and confined in hell forever, having their eternal torments increa&s;ed, by all the mi&s;chief they are doing, and &s;in they are tempting and leading man|kind into, in this world which they now well know, and have trembling apprehen&s;ions of now; yet, &s;uch is their malice, that they cannot forbear going on in their wickedne&s;s tho' to the increa&s;e of their eternal torments, Jam. ii. 19. "Thou believeth there is one God, thou doe&s;t well, the devils al&s;o believe and trem|ble."

<P>FINALLY to clo&s;e all with a word of emprovment, on what was offered and as we tru&s;t proved under the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, &s;hewing the fatal mi&s;take and danger tho&s;e are in, who deny the &s;cripture doctrine of future rewards and puni&s;hments, or that wicked men an all the ungodly &s;hall be eternaly puni&s;hed for their &s;ins in the other world. But why have men &s;uch an aver&s;ion to go&s;pel reverlation, &s;ince it abridges us of no plea&s;ures within the bounds of purity and innocence: nor does it oblige us to extingui&s;h our natural appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, but to govern and moderate them: it deprives us of nothing, but what, would be to our own hurt; as well as, hurt of &s;ociety, even in this &s;tate and much more in the world to come. But what if it be found at la&s;t that &s;uch unbelievers have rejected a true divine revelation, will it not involve them in the greate&s;t guilt and danger, when in that great day they &s;hall be judg|ed by this very go&s;pel Rom. ii. 16. But in a word is not the bear probability of the wrath to come &s;o dread|ful a thing, that a wi&s;e man would not run the hazard for a few tran&s;ient, vicious gratifications. The princi|pal man among the Dei&s;t, Lord Bolingbrook &s;ays (tho' perhaps &s;neeringly) that which is a &s;ober and momen|ous truth and what the rea&s;on of man cannot but ap|prove, that where there is a hell on the other &s;ide it is but natural prudence to take readily to the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide.</P>
