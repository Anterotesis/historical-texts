<P>TO pay an Honour unto a MOTHER, yea, and make the Memory of them to <HI>Live,</HI> in whom we received our <HI>Life;</HI> 'Tis what a <HI>Roman</HI> would practi&s;e: Even a <HI>Roman</HI> would make a Funeral Ora|tion for a <HI>Mother,</HI> e&s;pecially one whom he could boa&s;t, that he <HI>had never been reconciled unto:</HI> And therefore, it can|not be, that a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;hould Re|proach it: Even a <HI>Solomon</HI> him&s;elf was not the Le&s;s of One, for the Re&s;pect he paid unto his <HI>Mother.</HI></P>

<P>GLORIOUS Things are to be done for the CHURCH of God in the latter Days. And e&s;pecially for that People which for many Ages was the only Church of God in the World: His <HI>Peculiar;</HI> which for Ages not a few, has been <HI>Repudiated</HI> by the Lord, Rejected, Scattered, and <HI>cut off by Un|belief;</HI> which in the Ages coming on, is to be Converted, &amp; Re&s;tored, &amp; &s;et on the <HI>top of the Mountains,</HI> with <HI>all Nations flowing</HI> unto it. <HI>Glorious Things are &s;poken of thee, O thou City of God.</HI></P>

The Noble Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> under the In&s;pirations of God, is in the Chapter, and Context now before us, as well as el&s;ewhere, employed as the <HI>Herald,</HI> by whom the&s;e <HI>Excellent Things</HI> which the Lord will do, are &s;o Proclaimed, as to be <HI>known in all the Earth.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Excellent Things</HI> are Ex|hibited under the Term of, <HI>Con&s;olati|ons.</HI> But then, that the <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> may be de&s;cribed as <HI>exceeding Comfortable,</HI> there is a Metaphor u&s;ed, which car|ries the Tenderne&s;s of the <HI>Comforter,</HI> beyond all Expre&s;&s;ion. Our mo&s;t Gra|cious GOD, is plea&s;ed variou&s;ly to expre&s;s His <HI>Love</HI> to His People, and His <HI>Care</HI> of them: He has <HI>u&s;ed Simi|litudes</HI> for it, and this in a mo&s;t Ele|gant Variety. Among the&s;e, <HI>Herein God commendeth His Love to us,</HI> that He not only a&s;&s;ures us, P&s;al. CIII.13. <HI>Like as a Father pittieth his Children, &s;o the Lord pitties them that fear Him:</HI> He al&s;o gives us this A&s;&s;urance, <HI>As a Mother Comforteth her Children, &s;o will I Comfort them.</HI> Yea, I can tell where the Matter is carried further than &s;o; He &s;o Endears Him&s;elf unto His Peo|ple;
<PB N="5" REF="001693_0004_0FB5296A168559B0">I&s;a. XLIX.15. <HI>Can a Woman for|get her Sucking Child, that &s;he &s;hould not have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Son of her Bowels? Yea, They may forget; yet will not I for|get thee.</HI> Oh! The Endearments of our God! Beyond all the Endear|ments of the Tendere&s;t <HI>Mother</HI> in the World!</P>
<P>The <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> which the People of God find in Him, are here com|pared, Fir&s;t, unto tho&s;e which the Child has from the <HI>Mother,</HI> while in a &s;tate of <HI>Infancy:</HI> The <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> of the Infant, <HI>Sucking at the Brea&s;t of Con|&s;olations, carried in the Arms, dandled on the Knees of the Mother.</HI> But in the Ver&s;e now before us, the Compari|&s;on for the <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> goes on, to tho&s;e which a <HI>Man</HI> receives from his <HI>Mother.</HI> I have the Original on my &s;ide, in &s;o mending the Tran&s;lation; <HI>As it is with a MAN whom his Mother Comforteth.</HI> One Rea&s;on for it may be, Becau&s;e a <HI>Mother</HI> who &s;ees a Son grown to be a <HI>Man,</HI> and prove a Wor|thy and an U&s;eful and a Noted <HI>Man,</HI> and one that is to her, as they &s;aid unto <HI>Naomi, The Re&s;torer of her Life,
<PB N="6" REF="001693_0005_0FB5296C585CD100">and the Nouri&s;her of her old Age;</HI> Her Affection to &s;uch a Son, will be very Pa&s;&s;ionate, very Rapturous, very Marvellous, nothing will be equal to the Tran&s;port of it. A <HI>Mother,</HI> when &s;he has in her Sight, a Son that is a Valuable <HI>Man,</HI> and a Rich <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> of all her painful and anxious <HI>Nur&s;ery,</HI> &s;he places a violent Affection on him; &s;uch, that no Tongue is able to utter it! She thinks no <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> too much for a <HI>Son,</HI> that affords her &s;uch <HI>Con|&s;olations.</HI> They who take Notice of &s;uch Things, tell of a Nation in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> above others Remarkable for this Quality in the <HI>Mothers</HI> there, <HI>Prae alijs Matribus mire Filios &s;uos Grandevos amant.</HI> However, our God has a Kind|ne&s;s for us, which exceeds that of &s;uch a <HI>Mother.</HI> There is al&s;o this Rea|&s;on for it; Our God is concerned for the Welfare of His People, not only in their more <HI>early Days,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>all their Days. When I&s;rael was a Child, then I loved him,</HI> &s;ays the Lord; yea, and &s;o He will in the Riper and La|ter Years of His People. <HI>Having loved thy own, Lord, Thou wilt Love them to

I have thought of one Rea&s;on more for it. The Church will be arrived unto <HI>Mans E&s;tate,</HI> and and unto <HI>Manly Chri&s;tianity,</HI> when this Word &s;hall be accompli&s;hed. When the Church is come, <HI>unto a per|fect Man, unto the mea&s;ure of the Stature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> then, then &s;hall this have its full Accompli&s;hment. I will add but this one Remark more; Every Believer on the Son of God, may claim an immediate Share in the&s;e <HI>Con&s;olations.</HI> Every <HI>Child</HI> of God, in the <HI>Sufferings of this pre&s;ent Time,</HI> has a Claim to the&s;e more than <HI>Maternal Con&s;olations,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Glory that is to be Revealed.</HI></P>
<P>My DOCTRINE is now ready for me.</P>
<P><HI>The Con&s;olations derived from the mo&s;t Affectionate MOTHER upon Earth, do &s;hadow out, and are but a &s;hadow of, tho&s;e with which the Children of God will find their Heavenly Father Comforting of them.</HI></P>

The Di&s;po&s;ition which the Glori|ous God has to provide for the <HI>Com|fort</HI> of His People, has Two Re&s;em|blances, in His <HI>Two Te&s;taments;</HI> And in both of them, 'tis Re&s;embled unto the Provi&s;ion which <HI>Female-Parents</HI> make for their Young ones. Agree|ably to the more Sublime and Lofty Di&s;pen&s;ation, wherewith our Lord appeared for the delivering of His People, in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> we read; Deut. XXXII.11. <HI>As an Eagle flutter|eth over her Young, hearing them on her Wings, &s;o the Lord.</HI> Agreeably to the more Humble and Ob&s;cure Di&s;pen|&s;ation, wherewith our Lord made His Appearance to deliver His Peo|ple in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> we read; Matth. XXIII.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered your Children together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings.</HI> There is a Vehemence in the &Sgr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Rgr;&Ggr;&EEgr;, and Pa&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Animals, to have their Young ones Defended, Befriended, <HI>Comforted.</HI> But that the Di&s;po&s;ition in our God for the <HI>Comfort</HI> of His People, may have a yet more lively Emblem given of
<PB N="9" REF="001693_0006_0FB5296DD6AC3300">it, Behold, an Emblem found for it in the <HI>Rational</HI> World. As it is with a Man <HI>whom his Mother Comforteth!</HI> Our God is more di&s;po&s;ed for to <HI>Comfort</HI> us, and has better <HI>Comforts</HI> for us, than the mo&s;t Affectionate <HI>Mother</HI> in the World!</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t Thing I am to ob&s;erve, is this. There are con&s;iderable <HI>Con&s;o|lations</HI> enjoy'd by tho&s;e <HI>whom their MOTHER Comforteth.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Con&s;ola|tion</HI> to have a <HI>Mother</HI> Living. He is a barbarous Wretch, and worthy to have his Eyes pulled out in the <HI>Valley of Car|ea&s;es,</HI> who does not count it &s;o. Tho' it &s;hould be a <HI>Decayed</HI> Mother, a <HI>De|crepit</HI> Mother, one under all the In|conveniences of a <HI>Superannuation,</HI> and one that mu&s;t be entirely &s;upported by her <HI>Children,</HI> yet the Pre&s;ence of their <HI>Mother</HI> with them, is grateful to them if there be not a Barbarity of Ingratitude in the Children. The Jews have a Proverb among them, That a <HI>Mine of Gold</HI> in an Hou&s;e were not &s;o rich a Ble&s;&s;ing, as the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a <HI>Mother</HI> there. But then, there are numberle&s;s <HI>Con&s;olations</HI> which <HI>good
<PB N="10" REF="001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0">Mothers</HI> give unto their <HI>Children. Mo|thers</HI> are the <HI>Comforters</HI> of their Chil|dren. They are by <HI>Nature</HI> &s;o; have a &s;trong In&s;tinct of <HI>Nature</HI> for it; are <HI>Naturally</HI> very de&s;irous to &s;ee their Children <HI>Comfortable.</HI> They can't bear to &s;ee their Children in any <HI>unea&s;y</HI> Circum&s;tances. From this <HI>Natural In|clination</HI> in our <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Comfort</HI> us, how cheerfully do they, while we are yet in our Minority, go thro' many Fatigues, many Troubles, many Self-denials for us? What poor Shifts had we made in our Minority, if we had not had <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Comfort</HI> us? It was required, Deut. XXII.6. <HI>If a Birds Ne&s;t chance to be before thee, and there be a Dam &s;itting upon the Young, thou &s;halt not take away the Dam.</HI> A <HI>Dam</HI> is ill &s;pared from a <HI>Ne&s;t</HI> of <HI>Young ones.</HI> O Young ones, that have had your <HI>Mo|thers</HI> continued unto you, until you have been brought up to your Maturi|ty, <HI>Be Thankful;</HI> Be Thankful to a Compa&s;&s;ionate God, for all the <HI>Con|&s;olations</HI> which He has by your <HI>Mo|thers</HI> be&s;tow'd upon you. Nothing like an <HI>Own Mother!</HI> If &s;he be yet with
<PB N="11" REF="001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0">you, prize her Exceedingly! 'Tis but here and there, that <HI>Mothers-in-Law,</HI> are found <HI>Mothers-in-Love.</HI> Tho&s;e few that are &s;o, are never enough to be commended! And &s;till, as we <HI>grow up,</HI> the Concern of our <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Com|fort</HI> us does not <HI>grow Cold.</HI> Our <HI>Mothers</HI> continue their Concern to &s;ee us have all &s;orts of <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> as long as they continue their Concern to &s;ee us have all &s;orts of <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> as long as they continue with us. But then, there are &s;ome Ca&s;es, wherein the <HI>Con&s;ola|tions</HI> we receive in our <HI>Mothers,</HI> are Aggravated, are Di&s;tingui&s;hed, are Un&s;peakable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> un&s;peakably <HI>Com|fort</HI> us, when we have <HI>good In&s;tructions</HI> from them. There was a Wi&s;e Man, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when he could &s;ay, Prov. IV.3. <HI>I was a Tender and only one in the &s;ight of my Mother,</HI> and then follow the <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> from her, that helped him to be what he was. There was another Wi&s;e Man, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when there was, Prov. XXXI.3. <HI>The Prophecy that his Mother taught him;</HI> and &s;he told him what mu&s;t be done by the <HI>Son of her Vows. Mothers</HI> do &s;ometimes contri|bute
<PB N="12" REF="001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0">very much unto the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of their Children; yea, do very much to make them <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> The be&s;t Thing that &s;ome can be advi&s;ed unto, is, <HI>For&s;ake not the Law of thy Mo|ther.</HI> When our <HI>Mothers</HI> teach us our <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> and nouri&s;h our Souls with <HI>the &s;incere Milk of the Word</HI> of God, and charge us to do Well, and warn us to &s;hun the Paths of the De&s;troyer, We are tho&s;e that have our <HI>Mothers Comforting</HI> of us.</P>
<P>Secondly. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> un&s;peak|ably <HI>Comfort</HI> us, when we have <HI>good Examples</HI> from them. There was a Mini&s;ter of God, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when it could be &s;aid unto him, 2 Tim. I.4. <HI>The Faith which dwelt fir&s;t in thy Mother, I am per&s;waded is thee al&s;o.</HI> As there are Children <HI>Ru|ined</HI> by their <HI>Mothers,</HI> when it may be reported of them, as it was of one; 1 King. XXII.52. <HI>He did Evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his Mother;</HI> So a Man is one whom his <HI>Mother has Comforted,</HI> when his be&s;t way to do that which is <HI>Right in the &s;ight of the Lord,</HI> is, to <HI>walk in the
<PB N="13" REF="001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0">way of has Mother.</HI> Have we had <HI>Mo|thers</HI> who have been <HI>Patterns</HI> of Piety, and of <HI>Hobine&s;s in all manner of Conver|&s;ation?</HI> In whom we have &s;een an <HI>Abborrence</HI> of every <HI>Wicked Thing;</HI> a mighty Delight in Conver&s;ing with the <HI>Word</HI> of God; Reading over the Bible perhaps <HI>Twice every Year;</HI> a con|&s;tant Regard unto the <HI>Religion of the Clo&s;et?</HI> Yea, with &s;uch a Frequency, as no le&s;s than <HI>&s;ix Times</HI> in a Day. Such as been very <HI>Humble,</HI> in other Things, as well as their <HI>mode&s;t Attire;</HI> and very Charitable to the <HI>Poor,</HI> al|ways <HI>Doing</HI> for them, or <HI>Grieving</HI> for them? If they had any little <HI>Feminine Weakne&s;&s;es,</HI> yet being <HI>Women that feared the Lord,</HI> that Honourable Character the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> made a full Amends for all; and they were <HI>to be prai&s;ed for it.</HI> We are tho&s;e who have had our <HI>Mothers Comforting</HI> of us.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> un&s;peakably <HI>Comfort</HI> us when they are continually <HI>Praying</HI> for us. There are <HI>Mothers</HI> who can &s;ay to their Children, as in Gal. IV.19. My <HI>little Children, of whom I Travail in Birth again, until Chri&s;t be
<PB N="14" REF="001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8">formed in you. Mothers</HI> who are always <HI>Travailing</HI> for the Conver&s;ion and Sal|vation of their Children, with <HI>Suppli|cations</HI> full of Agony on their behalf; As <HI>Monica</HI> for her <HI>Au&s;tin; Mothers</HI> that mention all their Children be|fore the Lord, with &s;uitable Petitions for them, in their daily <HI>Supplications; Mothers</HI> that if their Children are in any Di&s;tre&s;s, make their importunate Vi&s;its to Heaven for them, in their fervent <HI>Supplications:</HI> Truly, the&s;e are <HI>comfortable Mothers.</HI> Perhaps, they have been <HI>Mothers,</HI> that would, very often, very often, &s;et apart <HI>whole Days</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> before the Lord. We may be &s;ure, they Remembred <HI>us</HI> on the&s;e Days; It may be, we were the <HI>main Articles</HI> of them. There are <HI>Mothers</HI> that lay up a &s;tock of <HI>Prayers</HI> for their Children; This is to lay up a &s;tock of <HI>Comforts</HI> for them. We read of one, Gen. XXIV.67. <HI>He was com|forted after the Death of his Mother.</HI> When a Devout <HI>Mother</HI> has been for many Years Praying and Weeping to the Lord for the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s</HI> to be multiplied upon their Children,
<PB N="15" REF="001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8">they may be <HI>comforted after the Death</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Mother; Comforted</HI> in this Con&s;ideration; <HI>Tho' &s;he be Dead, the Effects and An&s;wers of the Prayers that &s;he made before &s;he dyed, may be Living and La&s;ting with us!</HI></P>
<P>Thus 'tis, that our <HI>good Mothers</HI> do <HI>Comfort</HI> us. But O Children, How can you do any other then &s;tudy to be <HI>Comforts</HI> unto &s;uch obliging <HI>Mo|thers?</HI> When you were fir&s;t Born un|to them, they expected, <HI>This &s;ame &s;hall Comfort us.</HI> Oh! Let them not be di&s;appointed of their Expectations. A <HI>Di&s;appointment,</HI> which will de&s;erve and procure, that you who give it, &s;hould Peri&s;h Wonderfully! Your <HI>Mothers</HI> even Load you with <HI>Comforts;</HI> and all your <HI>Comforts</HI> are Theirs. Children. Do not you now fill them with <HI>Sorrows;</HI> Oh! Do not bring down their <HI>Gray Hairs</HI> therewith unto the Grave. Be it known unto you; Your Wickedne&s;s will fill them, and even kill them with <HI>Sorrows.</HI> You read, Prov. X.1. <HI>A Fooli&s;h Son is the Heavine&s;s of his Mother.</HI> And, Prov. XVII.25. <HI>A Fooli&s;h Son is a Bitterne&s;s to
<PB N="16" REF="001693_0010_0FB529761686B940">her that bare him.</HI> Very particularly, All Undutiful, All Rebellious, All Contemptuous <HI>Carriage</HI> towards your <HI>Mothers;</HI> Wretches, I tell you, it will be extremely Grievous to them. The Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the <HI>fifth Command|ment,</HI> are called, 1 Tim. I.9. <HI>Mur|derers of Mothery.</HI> If you don't <HI>Honour</HI> your <HI>Mothers,</HI> you <HI>Murder</HI> them. You had be&s;t beware, la&s;t you &s;o &s;ee pro|voke your <HI>Mothers,</HI> that they may Pronounce a <HI>Direful Thing</HI> in the An|gui&s;h that you give unto them. Some <HI>Direful Thing</HI> will befall you, if it &s;hould be &s;o. The <HI>Direful Thing</HI> will be dreadfully Executed on you. There are <HI>Executioners</HI> that &s;tand always rea|ly for it! You are wor&s;e than the Thievi&s;h <HI>Micah,</HI> if the Vengeance of an Irritated <HI>Mother</HI> be nothing with you. I pre&s;s for the Rever&s;e of this. <HI>Comfort</HI> your <HI>Mothers,</HI> by all po&s;&s;ible. Demon&s;trations of your Affection to them; in &s;peaking to them, in doing for them, all that is <HI>Comfortable.

Fir&s;t; Each of the Three Per&s;ons in the Eternal GODHEAD, is Di|&s;tinctly and Wondrou&s;ly at Work, to <HI>Comfort</HI> the People of God. Let us take a View of this Matter, and fall into a ju&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment at the Con|templation!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. God the <HI>Father</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. Our Acknowledgement, our Doxology to the Almighty <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> mu&s;t be that; 2 Cor. I.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, even the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulation.</HI> Certainly, we are <HI>com|forted</HI> by the Infinite <HI>Father,</HI> when He tells us, That He will be our <HI>Fa|ther.

O the <HI>Con&s;olations,</HI> O the <HI>Con|&s;olations,</HI> of &s;uch an Incomprehen&s;ible <HI>Inheritance!</HI> My Brethren, God the <HI>Father</HI> informs you, That He has <HI>cho|&s;en you before the Foundation of the World, that you &s;hould be Holy and Blamele&s;s be|fore Him in Love.</HI> God the <HI>Father</HI> in|forms you, That He hath <HI>&s;o loved you, at to give His Only-begotten Son for you, to bring you unto everla&s;ting Life.</HI> If there be any <HI>Comfort of Love,</HI> certain|ly 'tis in this <HI>Love!</HI> O Children of God, This is the <HI>Comfort, wherewith we are comforted of God!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. God the <HI>Sow</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. If a bright <HI>Angel</HI> were now to Preach among you; he would now thus call upon you; <HI>Behold, I bring you good Tidings of great Joy; To you there is born a Saviour.</HI> And he would not &s;tick to add, <HI>Never, never any Comfort came up to this!</HI> The Jew|i&s;h Rabbi's agreed upon it, That the Name of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> &s;hould be <HI>Mena|chem,</HI> or, <HI>The Comforter;</HI> Becau&s;e 'tis He that is thus called, Lam.

<PB N="23" REF="001693_0013_0FB5297B568935F8">We read of &s;uch a Thing as this to be forever taken for granted; <HI>Con&s;e|lation in Chri&s;t.</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Comferter</HI> we have in &s;uch a <HI>Saviour!</HI> The <HI>Con|&s;olations</HI> of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who is of God made <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Redemption</HI> unto us!

<P>Thirdly. God the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. 'Tis indeed His <HI>Office</HI> to be their <HI>Comforter.</HI> We read Joh. XV.26. <HI>The Comforter is the Spirit of Truth.</HI> Surely, we cannot but be <HI>comforted,</HI> when we feel our Minds Purified, Rectified, and brought into an Holy <HI>Order,</HI> &amp; an Heavenly <HI>Tem|per,</HI> and the <HI>Storms</HI> rai&s;ed by our Ir|regular Appetites appea&s;ed, and &s;uc|ceeded with the <HI>Peace of God which pa&s;&s;es all Under&s;tanding.</HI> We cannot but be <HI>comforted,</HI> when we are &s;atisfied, That our <HI>Sins</HI> are <HI>forgiven</HI> to us, and that our <HI>Souls</HI> are bound up in the <HI>Bundle of Life,</HI> and that <HI>Goodne&s;s and Mercy &s;hall follow us all our Days,</HI> and

<P>It has been a little Surpri&s;ing unto me to find, That in &s;ome of the Pri|mitive Writers, the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is call|ed, <HI>The Mother. Tertullian</HI> u&s;es this Denomination for the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> The <HI>Mother,</HI> who is Invocated with the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> The Deno|mination was ju&s;tified by this; That we are <HI>Born of the Holy Spirit.</HI> And it has a notable Coincidence with it; That when the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> comes to take a full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Church, and in doing &s;o, has formed the Hea|venly City; Then is this Prophecy fulfilled; As it <HI>is with a Man whom his Mother comforteth, &s;o will I Comfort you.</HI> Then the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God in His Church, will do the part of a <HI>Mother,</HI> in Cheri&s;hing the Souls of His Peo|ple, and <HI>comforting</HI> of them, with God becoming their <HI>exceeding Joy!</HI> A City which is the <HI>Mother of us all,</HI> &s;o inti|mately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI>

<P>Secondly. The <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Co|venant</HI> of God, are al&s;ufficient and inexhau&s;tible Springs of <HI>Comfort</HI> unto the People of God.

The Lord will there An|&s;wer thee, as He did the Angel; Zech.
