<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CIII. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, &s;o the LORD pitieth them that Fear Him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS P&s;alm is Entituled, <HI>A P&s;alm of David;</HI> in which he &s;tirreth up him|&s;elf and &s;ummoneth all his Powers, both of Body and Mind, to ble&s;s &amp; prai&s;e the Name of GOD. The particular Rea&s;ons of it, are;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Special mercy &s;hewn to him in forgiving his &s;ins &amp; healing his di&s;ea&s;es, and in &s;aving him from death when in imminent danger.</HI> See ver. 1. <HI>to</HI> 4. He &s;hews his care thus, To relieve the Oppre&s;&s;ed, ver. 5, 6. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>His Particular care for &amp; over his Church, even for I&s;rael, in giving his Law to them, and opening to them the my&s;teries of his Providence in their favour.</HI> ver. 7, 8, 9. So that if he corrects them for their Sins, as his cho&s;en people; yet he limits &amp; &s;ets bounds to his Anger, as to the time and the mea&s;ure of it. If he vi&s;its &s;ore, yet not accor|ding to the demerit of their &s;ins; but cau&s;es His Grace to Exert it &s;elf over their Unwor|thine&s;s, <HI>ver.</HI> 10, 11. But 'tis in &s;pecial
<PB N="2" REF="004155_0006_1003DAB1C8A1DAA8">
to <HI>them that fear Him:</HI> He pardons their &s;ins &amp; does them all away. They are removed from them <HI>&s;o far as the Ea&s;t and the We&s;t in their di&s;tances,</HI> ver. 12. This the Lord promi&s;es to do for the faithful, in the day of his gracious vi&s;itation, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31 34. And here, <HI>ver.</HI> 13. His gracious dealing is compared to that of a <HI>tender and compa&s;&s;ionate Father</HI> in his dealing with his Children. Text, <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil|dren, &amp;c</HI> God is a Father to &s;uch; in the way of the New Covenant he owns them to be &s;uch, let them be <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> in the Go&s;pel day, without di&s;tinction; and he treats them with like care and tenderne&s;s. And he is in &s;pecial &s;o tender and gracious in his dealings towards them that <HI>truly Fear him; i. e.</HI> the Seed of the Faithful; &s;uch as are Upright before him, and are under the influence of his Fear. &s;o as to make it their care to plea&s;e Him by keeping Covenant with him. Be it &s;o they offend at times and break his Laws, He that knows their defects, will bear much with their froward tem|pers &amp; peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions.

<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>That GOD has a Fatherly Care for His Covenant Children; in &s;pecial for them that Fear Him.</HI></Q>
<P>Here to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="004155_0007_1003DAB70B77D250">1. <HI>He has a Fatherly Care for his Covenant People in general.</HI> He has &s;o for I&s;rael, whil&s;t a Nation or People in Covenant with him; and he has &s;o for a People or Nation taken into Covenant in Go&s;pel times.</P>
<P>And we may briefly hint it in &s;everal In&s;tan|ces, in which the Lord &s;hews it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In declaring them to be his Children and owning them as &s;uch.</HI> When God brings <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into Covenant, he thus declares for Him&s;elf, and brings them thus to &s;tipulate with him; or to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s the mutual Engagement between them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26.17, 18. So it is in Go&s;pel Times, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8, 10. <HI>Again,</HI> He is &s;aid in terms, <HI>To be their Father;</HI> and they are &s;aid to be, <HI>His Sons &amp; Daughters,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.18.</P>
<P>But will the Mo&s;t High and holy GOD thus tran&s;act with Vile and Sinful men, that be as Worms of the du&s;t? Yes, &s;o tis; Oh! ineffable Grace and Conde&s;cention in him. The P&s;al|mi&s;t therefore Expre&s;&s;es his Rai&s;ed thoughts upon it, P&s;al. 8.4. <HI>What is man, that thou art thus mindful of him? or the &s;on of man, that thou art plea&s;ed thus to vi&s;it him?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In taking them under his Fatherly Conduct &amp; Directions</HI> Herein he acts the part of a Father. Parental care tends to this; To be &s;ure for the Child while he is a Child, and wants skill and conduct to direct him&s;elf. Now the Father will keep him under his Eye, and not let him go
<PB N="4" REF="004155_0008_1003DABA56A6E788">
far from him, or get out of his &s;ight. The Lord has thus the wakeful Eye of his Providence over <HI>I&s;rael</HI> night &amp; day: The <HI>Pillar of the cloud by day,</HI> and that <HI>of fire by night,</HI> to guide them in the way they &s;hould go. This &s;hews his par|ticular care to guide them in the Wilderne&s;s, after he has brought them out of <HI>Egypt</HI> by a Mighty Hand and prevented them in their low E&s;tate, <HI>Exod.</HI> 13.21, 22. So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaks in his Divine Song concerning them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.10. Thus, <HI>When I&s;rael is a child the Lord loves him, and calls his &s;on out of Egypt,</HI> Ho&s;. 11.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the Provi&s;ion he makes for them.</HI> 'Tis the care of a tender Father to provide for his Chil|dren; to be &s;ure while they be young and not able to provide for them&s;elves. The Lord has this care for men in general, to provide for them, <HI>He provides for Man and Bea&s;t;</HI> The&s;e are all his Creatures, and live upon his Bounty day by day. But he provides in &s;pecial
for <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> as his People in Covenant; in the Wilder|ne&s;s, P&s;al. 78.26. <HI>He gives them bread from hea|ven, and water out of the rock.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In taking them under his &s;pecial Protection.</HI> A Father will do this as he is able for his Child, He will protect him from harm, if he be expo|&s;ed by Enemies, or by Bea&s;ts of prey, &amp;c. The Lord takes <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> from the time of his coming up out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> down to Succeeding Times, under the wing of his Protection. He is tender
<PB N="5" REF="004155_0009_1003B86C5E17EB20">
of them, <HI>even as of the apple of his Eye, Deut.</HI> 32.10. If any touch them to do them harm, &s;till they provoke Him to anger by their &s;ins; and &s;hall be &s;ure to feel his Re&s;entments for it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 105.13, 14, 15.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>In bearing with their evil Tempers and Man|ners.</HI> Parents are thus pitiful towards their Children, in bearing with their peevi&s;h Tempers and froward Di&s;po&s;itions; they bear much and long with them; to be &s;ure &s;ome do &s;o: they bear with that from them thro' love &amp; tender|ne&s;s, which others can't that be &s;trangers to them or not &s;o nearly related. So the Lord bears with that from his People in Covenant, that he will not bear with from others. He bears with that from them, which they won't or can't bear with from one another. This the Context &s;hews. He bears with them long; and if their Sins be many and very grievous, and heavy Enough to tire his Patience, if he were like a weak and angry man; &s;o that he would be for con&s;uming them at once. See <HI>Jonah</HI> 4.1, 3. <HI>compar'd with Neh.</HI> 1.3. Mal 36. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not: therefore ye &s;ons of Jacob are not con&s;umed.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>In the Correction he u&s;es when he &s;ees there is need.</HI> He &s;ees at times there is need of it: Milder means won't do; Chidings won't do; Reproofs, Admonitions, Warnings, Threat|nings won't do; He hews them by his Servants
<PB N="6" REF="004155_0010_1003DAC78F259BF8">
the Prophets, and &s;lays them by the words of his Mouth, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.5. So the Lord threatens <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But this is not &s;ufficient to Reclaim them. Now he proceeds to vi&s;it with the Rod. But how loth does he &s;eem to be to come to it, or to u&s;e it as he might? If he Corrects, he acts as a Father in it, and not as an incen&s;ed Judge. His Correction is &s;ea&s;onable; He will take a proper time and &s;ea&s;on for it: He will not do it too &s;oon; &s;o as to be &s;udden and ha&s;ty in it; nor will he defer it too long. He will take them alone to do it, or by them&s;elves as &s;eparate from other people, and when their minds are be&s;t prepared to receive it, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.28. Farther, In its particular nature and kind, it &s;hall be &s;ea&s;o|nable and proper to carry light and conviction with it, that they may read or &s;ee their Sin in the puni&s;hment of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18 26. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. Again, As to the mea&s;ure of it; The Church prays for this, Jer. 10 24 <HI>O Lord, correct me, but with judgment, &amp;c le&s;t thou bring me to nothing.</HI> He tries lighter &s;trokes, and then more heavy, if there be need; but yet 'tis in mea&s;ure. <HI>He does in the mid&s;t of Judgment remember Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>And for a clo&s;e to this, here we may ob&s;erve a Fathers pity herein, His lothne&s;s to give them up, if they prove Incorrigible under all See the yearnings of his bowels; as the heart of a tender Parent ready to break within him, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 11.8. Yea, rather than do as at times, when all
<PB N="7" REF="004155_0011_1003DACF46555298">
means fail, he will try his own Strength upon them, and break their &s;tubborn and rebellious Hearts by the power of his Almighty Arm: (What is more than any Earthly Parent can po&s;&s;ibly do) See it in <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s turn, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19, 20. Thus for the fir&s;t General Head.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To &s;hew He has this Care in &s;pecial for them that truly Fear Him.</HI> Be it &s;o his Fatherly care reaches to the Body of a People in Covenant with him, then that of a more &s;pecial nature to them that truly fear him. The&s;e are the faith|ful in the Land, on whom the Lord has &s;et his Eye, and in whom he delights.</P>
<P>His Fatherly Care for them intends &s;uch things as the&s;e in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That his Love to them is Peculiar.</HI> He has &s;et his love upon them before the Foundation of the world. He has Loved them with an Everla&s;ting Love, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.3. They are cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, to be to the glory of his Grace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He has given them to know his Name and to put their Tru&s;t in Him.</HI> Others hear of him and may have &s;ome &s;en&s;ible manife&s;tations of his Pre&s;ence and Glory (As <HI>I&s;rael</HI> at the Red Sea, and at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> after it, upon the giving the Law) that now di&s;po&s;e them to Prai&s;e him or to Fear him for a time; but they don't &s;ee him, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> does in the Proclamation of his Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34, 6, 7. Or as <HI>Abraham.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004155_0012_1003DAD4AEE43A08">
<HI>I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> their Fathers, before did, when he made or declared his Covenant with them; or as &s;uch as truly fear God in the Go&s;pel-day, know him at times in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Job.</HI> 17.3. The Spirit of God thus opening their Under&s;tandings in Go&s;pel Truths and giving them to &s;ee &amp; know the things &s;et forth, or the Objects revealed by this medium, in a &s;piritual manner; or to Evidence the clearne&s;s &s;o as they could not &s;ee them before, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 9, <HI>to</HI> 14. So 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. &amp; <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their Relation to God 'tis Saving.</HI> Others are Vi&s;ibly related to him; they may have right to External Privileges, as having a Regular &s;tanding in the Covenant: But the&s;e upon be|lieving in Chri&s;t and coming up to the Go&s;pel Condition, have the favour or privilege of Adoption in a <HI>Saving &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>meaning.</HI> They have a real vital Union to Chri&s;t, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.12. They have the &s;pirit of Children given to them as the fruit of their Faith. Hence a filial fear of God &amp; love to him; coming to him with free|dom, as Children to a Father, in the duty of Prayer, or by way of Complaint upon occa&s;ion. This is more in &s;ome than others, and more &s;en|&s;ible in the Subject of it at one time than at an|other; but yet there is &s;omething of it in every true Believer, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.15. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God's Providence is concerned in all his dealings, to promote their be&s;t good and to farther them in the
<PB N="9" REF="004155_0013_1003DADB86EE42F0">
way to Eternal Life.</HI> See the faith of the upright man for this, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. Let us then be directed to look con&s;tantly to the glory of God as our ultimate End in whatever we do or &s;uffer, and this will arm us with Chri&s;tian fortitude and patience, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7 Others have found its &s;trength &amp; efficacy, when acted from this &s;pirit of Faith, in the view of things un&s;een and eternal. See it in the Primitive Chri&s;tians under their Per&s;ecutions, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.17.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>&V;SE</HI> of the <HI>DOCTRINE.</HI></P>
<P>USE, I. Of <HI>Information</HI> and <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> in a few Particulars. Learn hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Obligations of &s;uch a People to GOD mu&s;t be &s;pecial and very great.</HI> As they be the Subjects of his Fatherly Care, &s;o their Obligations are proportionate as Children, to be true and faithful to him. See what the Lord expects from <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> on the account of what he had done in taking them into Covenant with him&s;elf. He &s;aves them before hand, as it were. He migh|tily tru&s;ts and confides in them, that they will be obedient &amp; true to what they promi&s;e, and what he has &s;o fairly bound them to do. I&s;a 63.8 <HI>He &s;aid, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: &s;o he was their Saviour.</HI> They be in particular bound to love the Lord their God, and to cleave to him as their Portion and Inhe|ritance;
<PB N="10" REF="004155_0014_1003DAF5961D3D58">
they are to give up them&s;elves to him in Heart and Life, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6, 4, 5. They be obliged to fear and honour Him. See the Lord's chal|lenge, (on the common right of a Parent) to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Mal. 1.6. <HI>A &s;on honoureth his father, &mdash;If I then be your Father, where is mine Honour?</HI> They are to be much in the &s;tudy of his Pre|cepts to know his Mind and Will, that &s;o they may be Obedient to him in all things, and may attend the duties of Natural and Revealed Re|ligion with care: They are to Fear GOD and Reverence their Superiors in every Order. Its like to go well with a People when the Fifth Commandment is &s;trictly ob&s;erved by them. They are to own and profe&s;s the Truths of God, and to Wor&s;hip him aright, <HI>Job.</HI> 4.24. They are to Fear and Reverence his Great and Holy Name; to Sanctify the Sabbath, to keep it as a Holy Day unto the Lord; to Love his Hou&s;e, his Wor&s;hip and Ordinances therein, and not live in the carele&s;s Neglect of any of his In&s;titutions. Farther, They are to to be Sober, Temperate, Peaceable, Cha&s;t, Diligent in Bu|&s;ine&s;s, Men of Truth and Hone&s;ty, Kind and Charitable, and &s;o govern their Affections as to the&s;e things, by the rules of Rea&s;on and Re|ligion: They are to be Humble and Meek, not Proud &amp; Haughty; &s;o as to gain the a&s;cendant over their corrupt Humours and Pa&s;&s;ions: And to be in all things Blamele&s;s as the Sons of God

without Rebuke. If the world in general be Corrupt, they ought not to be &s;o; but be &s;epa|rate &amp; &s;top at a di&s;tance from them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.15. They are to con&s;ider the End of God's dealing with them, and what will be the End of their contrary Carriage to Him, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.29 Farther, As to the &s;pecial tyes of Gra|titude to God, which are thus laid upon them and how if herein they fail and are unmind|ful of the God that has formed them and Re|deemed them, there's ju&s;t ground of Com|plaint again&s;t them; As in <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.6.</P>
<P N="2">2.

If they are told of their Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, Inju&s;tice, Deceit and Lying. If they are told of their Strifes &amp; Divi&s;ions in Towns and Churches, to the waft of much precious Time, as well as to their apparent hurt and damage in Temporals and Spirituals.

And la&s;t, <HI>May be in a word of Encou|ragement &amp; Comfort, to Two &s;orts of Per&s;ons.</HI> Is the Lord as our God &amp; Father in Covenant, a God of <HI>&s;uch tender Pity to them that fear him as his Covenant Children?</HI> It may Encourage or Comfort two &s;orts of per&s;ons. In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Souls in Di&s;tre&s;s under Inward Troubles;</HI> as Convinced Sinners, or &s;uch whom the Lord may be about to humble and prepare for his grace, that yet remain in the dark, and have not &s;een that the Lord is gracious. Here,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Con&s;ider, <HI>There is grace enough in God for you.</HI> Be it &s;o you have &s;inned with a high hand and have lived long in it, &s;o as to give ground to fear you have got beyond the <HI>reach of mercy,</HI> yet con&s;ider this grace &amp; goodne&s;s in the <HI>Foun'+tain,</HI> 'tis Infinite. And it may be the Lord de|&s;igns to pour it forth upon you, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.20</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>He gives you particular Encouragement to &s;eek it.</HI> Does your trouble and di&s;tre&s;s drive you to God? as it does if it works aright. As
<PB N="26" REF="004155_0030_1003DC2433EAC968">
wounded in &s;pirit, are you &s;o prepared to look <HI>to him for Healing?</HI> Your Encouragement now is great. 'Tis the Spirits work now in the time of his gracious Vi&s;itation, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10 <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.10</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>He has be&s;tow'd it on others, as vile or wor&s;e than you be.</HI> Be it &s;o you are Vile &amp; de&s;erve to be turned down to Hell, and you appear to be viler than any man; yet there be Patterns of mercy before you. See it in <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh, Mary Mag|dalene,</HI> the <HI>Thief on the Cro&s;s,</HI> &amp; others 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>He promi&s;es to Accept you upon believing and hoping in his Mercy.</HI> He bids you do it, &amp; warns you not to &s;eek for re&s;t any where el&s;e. 'Tis the Lord <HI>again&s;t whom you have &s;inned,</HI> and 'tis his Prerogative to indemnify &amp; clear you from your Guilt. And this is &s;ure to the Soul that truly turns and repents, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let it be of Comfort to all &s;uch as truly fear the Lord.</HI> This Doctrine gives ground of &s;trong Con&s;olation to all &s;uch <HI>as truly fear the Lord,</HI> or have rea&s;on &s;o to hope from what they have <HI>&s;een of him</HI> in his <HI>Power, Grace</HI> and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> after they have been brought <HI>to &s;en&s;ible Con|viction</HI> of their own Sinfulne&s;s, Nothingne&s;s &amp; Unworthine&s;s of his Favour. So if they may gather it from <HI>the gracious fruits of his Love in them;</HI> as to Tru&s;ting in him upon being bro't to know him and to &s;ee him in his <HI>Relative Goodne&s;s;</HI> &s;o to Love him and Fear him with <HI>holy Fear,</HI> as is the &s;pirit of his Children: Such
<PB N="27" REF="004155_0031_1003DC2F864E0F38">
have <HI>&s;ure ground of Comfort.</HI> Here Two things. Let &s;uch Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>The Covenant with the Promi&s;e of it is &s;ure.</HI> The Covenant is Everla&s;ting: It reaches to you, and to your Seed, upon condition. 'Tis &s;uch a Relation made between God and you, as that no Relation in Nature can reach it, or in the way of Civil Contract. 'Tis &s;et forth by many things; but they do but faintly &s;hew it. The Lord &s;peaks of being <HI>a Father to you in Co|venant;</HI> and he is more than &s;o: Of being <HI>your Husband;</HI> and he is yet more than &s;o, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 54.5. Such Relations hold fa&s;t for Life; but &s;uch is your Covenant Intere&s;t, as that <HI>neither Life nor Death can di&s;anul it.</HI> The Covenant <HI>it is Ever|la&s;ting,</HI> and &s;o is the Foundation of your Com|fort, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.3. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 38, 39.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Hence all his Dealings with them are in this way.</HI> Let the man that truly fears the Lord Con&s;ider this, <HI>The Lord is ever mindful of his Co|venant, in the good or evil which he brings upon you;</HI> and it reaches to your Children too, as they may be prepar'd to fear him &amp; &s;erve him Early. For which you have great Encouragement to Plead at the Throne of grace. See the En|couragement, here as it follows the Text, ver. 17, 18. <HI>But the Mercy of the Lord is from Ever|la&s;ting to Everla&s;ting upon them that Fear him; and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Childrens Children: To &s;uch as keep his Covenant, and to tho&s;e that remember his Commandments to do them.</HI></P>
