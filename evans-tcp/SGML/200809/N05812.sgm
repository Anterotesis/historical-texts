<HEAD>A LETTER relating to the OHIO-Defeat.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you live at a di&s;tance from the &s;eat of news, and may know nothing of the <HI>Ohio-Defeat</HI> but from hear&s;ay-reports, which, having pa&s;&s;ed thro' a variety of hands before they have reached you, mu&s;t be very uncertain, and mixed with a great deal that is not true, I have been at the pains, for your gratification, to put toge|ther, from the be&s;t accounts, the whole of what may be depended on for fact, in relation to this intere&s;ting affair to all the <HI>Briti&s;h American</HI> Go|vernments: And if I &s;hould hereupon add a few thoughts, tending to point out to you <HI>wherein</HI> this defeat, however inglorious in it&s;elf, is yet naturally and powerfully adapted to &s;erve the&s;e Colonies in the end, it may give &s;ome relief to your anxious mind, and di&s;po&s;e you to wait, with a becoming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e military operations which are but ju&s;t begun.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t news of this defeat was bro't us in a letter from Col. <HI>Innes,</HI> dated <HI>July</HI> 11th, in the&s;e words, <Q>I have this moment received the melancholly news of the defeat of our troops, the General killed and numbers of our officers, our whole artillery taken. In &s;hort, the ac|count I have received is &s;o very bad, that, as plea&s;e God, I intend to make a &s;tand here. It's highly nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the militia every where to defend the Frontiers.</Q> It at once appeared to every one, from the general air and &s;train of this letter, that the aged <HI>Colonel</HI> was under the influence of a &s;trong panic when he wrote it, for which rea&s;on we were di&s;po&s;ed to hope, that matters were not &s;o bad as he had &s;ug|ge&s;ted; and by after contradictory accounts we were encouraged in this hope, till the <HI>&s;econd</HI> of this in&s;tant, when, upon the arrival of the we&s;tern po&s;t, it was put beyond all doubt, by a variety of letters, that the <HI>Ohio-reincounter</HI> was, on our &s;ide, every way as di&s;advantageous as we were at fir&s;t led to conceive it to be.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007381_0003_102B8CB07023CAA0">
By comparing the accounts we have hitherto received, it appears, <Q>that the <HI>General</HI> proceeded from the little meadows with about 1300 men, mo&s;tly <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> be&s;ides the nece&s;&s;ary artillery, ammunition, and provi&s;ions, leaving the main body of the convoy under the care of Col. <HI>Dunbar,</HI> with orders to join him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; that on the 9th of <HI>July</HI> the <HI>Monongahela</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t by 300 men&punc; then by 200, then by the <HI>General</HI> him&s;elf, with the column of artillery, bag|gage, and main body of the army, about one o'clock; that immedi|ately upon this a quick and heavy fire was heard from the front; that the detachments of the 2 and 300 men gave way, and fell back in great con&s;ternation upon the main body, who were ha&s;tening to &s;u&s;tain them; that this &s;truck the men with &s;uch a panic, and bro't on &s;uch confu&s;ion as could not, by any expedients, be afterwards remedied; and that in con&s;equence of this, notwith&s;tanding the courage and re|&s;olution of the officers, the enemy obtained a compleat victory, killing and wounding a great many,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the lowe&s;t computation, between 6 and 700 &s;oldiers, officers and private men, were killed, or wounded, be&s;ides pioneers, waggoners, &s;ervants, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></NOTE> and obliging the re&s;t to quit the ground, leaving behind them the artillery, ammunition, provi&s;ions, and whole baggage.</Q></P>
<P>The number of the enemy remains &s;till &s;omewhat uncertain. One of the officers writes, "it was impo&s;&s;ible by the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to judge of their number." Another is pretty certain, "that they did not exceed above 3 or 400." A Gentleman from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> of good intelligence &s;ays, "by the be&s;t accounts there were about 400 <HI>Indians</HI> and 80 <HI>French.</HI>" I am inclined to think, they were not much more numerous; for if they had, they would probably have cut off the whole army, as they had &s;o great an advantage again&s;t them, and fired, not in the <HI>European</HI> way, but by <HI>taking aim,</HI> in which method of firing the <HI>Canadians,</HI> as well as <HI>Indians,</HI> are very dextrious.</P>
<P>But whether their number was great, or &s;mall, they made &s;ad havock of our men. Perhaps, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, hi&s;tory will &s;carce furni&s;h an in&s;tance of &s;uch a dreadful carnage. To be &s;ure, the like was never before &s;een in <HI>North-America:</HI> Nor could it have happened, humanly &s;peaking, without great mi&s;conduct, either in the officers, or &s;oldiers, or both. Some are plea&s;ed to lay the blame on the <HI>&s;oldiers;</HI> &s;peaking of them as <HI>cowards,</HI> and as leaving their officers to fall a &s;acri|fice to the enemy. Others &s;eem to think, the <HI>chief commander</HI> was ra|ther principally faulty in not u&s;ing due caution, and a prudent foreca&s;t, to guard the men again&s;t the &s;urprize which involv'd them in de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007381_0004_102B8CB261F04F08">
It does not come within my pre&s;ent de&s;ign to enter upon an enquiry into the <HI>blameable &s;ource</HI> of this mi&s;chief; tho' you will unavoidably perceive my opinion about it, by reading what I have to offer with re&s;|pect to the <HI>tendency</HI> of it <HI>finally</HI> to &s;erve the intere&s;t of even all the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h American Colonies.</HI></P>
<P>I readily own, this defeat, in many re&s;pects, is a <HI>terrible evil.</HI> Great di&s;honour has been reflected on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> arms;&mdash;the <HI>Indians</HI> will be more &s;trongly attached to the <HI>French</HI> than ever;&mdash;the <HI>French</HI> are in|&s;pir'd with greater courage and re&s;olution, while, at the &s;ame time, their &s;trength is very much increa&s;ed by the artillery, ammunition, and &s;tores, bro't by us, within 7 miles of their fort, at an immen&s;e expence of la|bour and money: Be&s;ides all which, our <HI>&s;outhern colonies</HI> are thrown in|to perplexity and confu&s;ion, and lie doubly expo&s;ed to the depredations of the <HI>&s;avages</HI> of the wilderne&s;s.&mdash;But the&s;e things notwith&s;tanding, it may be be&s;t, in the <HI>end,</HI> we have met with this lo&s;s. Shameful and mi&s;|chievous as it is, it may be one of the grand links in that chain of cau&s;es, by which Heaven may intend to cha&s;ti&s;e the <HI>French,</HI> curb their in&s;olence, drive them out of the encroachments they have made on us, and reduce them to a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping within their own boundaries without di&s;|turbing us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ours. The&s;e, I would hope, are the <HI>be|neficial con&s;equences</HI> aimed at by providence: Nor, as I imagine, could any thing have happened more naturally and &s;trongly adapted to bring in|to effect &s;uch happy events.</P>
<P>'Tis too evident to be di&s;puted, that the <HI>&s;outhern Colonies</HI> needed &s;ome|thing EXTRAORDINARY to rou&s;e them out of that <HI>deep &s;ecurity</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I very ju&s;tly &s;peak of them as in <HI>deep &s;ecurity;</HI> for tho' it was the greate&s;t part of a year from the time of Col. <HI>Wa&s;hington'</HI>s defeat to the arrival of General <HI>Braddock</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> yet they had not rai&s;ed &s;o many as one 1000 men to join the troops from <HI>England;</HI> which we, in the&s;e parts, can attribute to nothing but their being, to an high degree, <HI>carele&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure:</HI> E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that this is not one fifth part of the men that have been rai&s;ed in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province</HI> only, in a much le&s;s time, tho' they were not under the like nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE> they were unhappily &s;unk into. Had they had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their danger from the <HI>French,</HI> who were &s;ettling and fortifying on their back-lands; had they in time wi&s;ely concerted, and vigorou&s;ly executed, mea&s;ures for driving them off, they might ea&s;ily have done it, and at a comparatively &s;mall expence. It was unaccountable inattention to their own &s;afety that bro't them into tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which gave ri&s;e to the embarkation of troops from home, and a greater national charge following thereupon than has ever been expended upon the <HI>northern Colonies,</HI> from their fir&s;t &s;ettlement to this day. And the de&s;truction of the&s;e troops, in &s;o &s;triking
<PB N="6" REF="007381_0005_102B8CB471BBCBD8">
a way, accompanied with &s;uch lo&s;s and di&s;appointment, is eminently fit|ted to alarm their fears, awaken in them a &s;en&s;e of danger, and con&s;train them to &s;peed and vigour, in pro&s;ecuting methods, both for guarding <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and annoying the <HI>French.</HI> And &s;hould it operate to the pro|duction of the&s;e good effects, as it naturally tends to do, the damage in the <HI>end,</HI> would be more than counter-ballanced. For there are more than 40 <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> in the &s;outhern &s;ettlements to one <HI>Frenchman;</HI> and where the di&s;proportion is &s;o great, they mu&s;t be capable, under a com|mon ble&s;&s;ing, of putting it out of the power of the <HI>French</HI> to do them any harm,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> only contains more inhabitants than the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> And it would be &s;trange, if that province, with <HI>Maryland, Virginia,</HI> and the two <HI>Carolinas,</HI> were not va&s;tly more than a match for the comparatively few <HI>French,</HI> who are &s;uch bad neighbours to them. Had we, in <HI>New-England,</HI> no &s;ettlements and for|tre&s;&s;es behind us &s;uperior to tho&s;e on the back of them, we &s;hould e&s;teem our&s;elves quite &s;afe, not thinking we had any thing to fear from the <HI>French,</HI> tho' we had no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></NOTE> unle&s;s they are madly re&s;olved to continue carele&s;s and in|active; which can't well be &s;uppo&s;ed after the late occurrence, &s;o pow|erfully &s;uited to excite in them a becoming concern for the &s;ecurity of their liberties and properties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One would have tho't it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> colonies, by what has happened among them, &s;hould have been excited to an <HI>immediate</HI> care for their own &s;afety; but we hear, to our very great &s;urpri&s;e, that <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> have done nothing as yet; that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is in a wrangle about the method of &s;upplying money; and that <HI>New-York</HI> have revoked their vote to rai&s;e 400 men, tho' they had forwarded this vote to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-Government: Upon which I would only &s;ay, they are in a more <HI>profound &s;leep</HI> than I imagin'd; but I doubt not, they will be tho'-roughly rou&s;ed, when they find, that the people in their out-&s;ettlements are killed, or captivated, or obliged to retire into the heart of their country for &s;afety, as will &s;oon be the ca&s;e, and the &s;ooner for their pre&s;ent carele&s;sne&s;s, and to their far greater co&s;t.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our <HI>&s;outhern</HI> brethren, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have not been u&s;ed to <HI>military</HI> expeditions. The &s;ooner therefore they are put upon them the better. For their being u&s;ed to them will, I believe, be found the ONLY STABLE FOUNDATION upon which, under the &s;miles of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the well conducted a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they may expect to hold their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without mole&s;tation from the <HI>French.</HI> And provi|dence may be opening the way for THIS STABLE FOUNDATION by the pre|&s;ent <HI>evil event,</HI> the rather adapted to this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e &s;o <HI>extraor|dinary</HI> in its circum&s;tances. The &s;teps by which it leads hereto are ea&s;ily di&s;cernable, tho' they may be tho't tedious and burden&s;ome. They will, by means of this di&s;a&s;ter, be more liable than they ever were before to the incur&s;ions of the <HI>Natives,</HI> &s;et on and &s;trengthened by the perfidious
<PB N="7" REF="007381_0006_102B8CB6464D7EB0">
<HI>French;</HI> this will put them under, what I may call, an happy nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing con&s;iderable numbers of men to protect their Frontiers, and &s;cour the Woods; this will inure their men to hard&s;hips, and in&s;en&s;ibly teach them the art of war, as it ought to be carried on in a <HI>wilderne&s;s-land:</HI> and, in con&s;equence of the&s;e things, they will &s;oon have within them&s;elves a power &s;ufficient for their own defence, and capable of be|ing employed offen&s;ively too, as there may be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is the way in which the <HI>northern</HI> colonies have had numbers of men, from generation to generation, trained up for war, and in&s;pired with martial courage di&s;po&s;ing them, with all readine&s;s, to go forth again&s;t the enemy, whether <HI>French,</HI> or <HI>Indian,</HI> or <HI>both,</HI> as they have been called thereto. And were the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> colonies, in the &s;ame way, form'd for milita|ry exploits, it would be an ea&s;y thing, with comparatively little help from home, wi&s;ely conducted, to drive the <HI>French,</HI> not only out of their en|croachments, but out of the&s;e parts of the earth. And perhaps this may be the view of providence; and the <HI>Ohio-defeat</HI> may be one of the grand &s;teps leading to it, by alarming the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies, the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> ones in &s;pecial, and putting them upon the acquirement and exerci&s;e of martial &s;kill and valor, even from nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>This defeat has an obvious tendency al&s;o to an&s;wer another very good purpo&s;e, it may be, the mo&s;t important of any in order to &s;ucce&s;s in our attempts again&s;t the <HI>French;</HI> and this is, the effecting an alteration in <HI>&s;ome material articles,</HI> as they re&s;pect the <HI>military power</HI> that may be employed to this end.</P>
<P>It has been tho't nece&s;&s;ary, that the <HI>chief Command</HI> &s;hould be lodged in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Officer of known courage, and experience in the art of war as practi&s;ed in <HI>Europe.</HI> This gave ri&s;e to the appearance of <HI>General Braddock</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> as <HI>Head</HI> of all his Maje&s;ty's forces in <HI>North-Ame|rica.</HI> And to this, I believe, it may principally be attributed, that we met with &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;s on the banks of the <HI>Monongahela.</HI> Not that I que&s;tion the per&s;onal valor of this Gentleman, or his military &s;kill in the regular way: But he had no Idea of the <HI>manner of fighting</HI> in u&s;e here, and therefore wholly neglected the only effectual expedients to guard again&s;t the fatal con&s;equences that aro&s;e from it. It does not indeed look very likely, that a &s;tranger to the country, and one altogether unacquain|ted with its warlike methods, which are known to be quite different from what they are in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould be the be&s;t qualified per&s;on to have the chief hand in planing, and executing, the ho&s;tile &s;chemes nece&s;&s;ary for our protection and &s;ecurity, The pre&s;ent melancholly event is, all cir|cum&s;tances con&s;idered, &s;urprizingly calculated to give in&s;truction and
<PB N="8" REF="007381_0007_102B8CB866708BB0">
warning upon this head: Nor, after &s;uch dear bought experience, is it probable we &s;hall again have our fir&s;t military officer from home. Or &s;hould this be &s;till tho't nece&s;&s;ary, we may rea&s;onably hope, he will be &s;o re&s;trained as not to have it in his Power to act, but with the advice of &s;ome thoroughly experienced <HI>American</HI> actually pre&s;ent with him. Had <HI>General Braddock</HI> been thus re&s;trained, tis morally certain, he would not have been &s;o &s;hamefully &s;urprized and beat. It does not appear, that he wanted good advice; and &s;ome are of opinion, that if he had hearkened to it, not holding tho&s;e in too great contempt, who, tho' inferior to him in regular military &s;kill, were yet better ac|quainted with the methods proper to be u&s;ed with &s;uch an enemy as he had to engage with, he might have been alive at this day, and in circum&s;tances to have forced <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> out of the hands of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>American provincial</HI> troops, the <HI>New-England</HI> ones in parti|cular, who have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to hard&s;hips and hazards for their King and Country, and by their bravery done eminent &s;ervice for both, may have been too much neglected, I mean in tho&s;e <HI>appointments</HI> which are the proper reward of military merit. The Regiments upon the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment ordered to be rai&s;ed this year, in the&s;e colonies, were &s;o &s;upply'd with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> officers, that room was left for only here and there one of an <HI>American</HI> de&s;cent; and perhaps room would not have been left even for the&s;e few, had it not been a nece&s;&s;ary expedient in order to the filling up of the regiments. Nor is this the fir&s;t time, that as brave men as any in the world have been treated with like neglect. Tis well known, <HI>New-England</HI> gave peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> not many years ago, by the valor of their men in reducing <HI>Cape-Breton;</HI> and yet, the&s;e very men were &s;trangely overlook'd in the appointment of officers for the two Regiments that were rai&s;ed, even from among them|&s;elves, for the &s;ecuring that important acqui&s;ition; that is to &s;ay, <HI>New-England</HI> men did all the &s;ervice, both in taking and keeping this &s;trong fortre&s;s, and one and another from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> were put into <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the po&s;ts of honor and profit, to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e who had merited them, and were, without any reflection; as well capable of filling them. A different conduct &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary; if any thing is ever intended to be done to good purpo&s;e again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> in the&s;e parts of the world. And the late horrid &s;laughter of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> officers, as well as private &s;oldiers, may have a tendency to bring it about. It is certainly adapted to &s;uch a purpo&s;e. For it is now made manife&s;t, and in a way that can't fail, one would think, of convincing even all <HI>England,</HI> that neither <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> officers, nor private &s;oldiers, without <HI>American</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can be depended on for &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t <HI>American</HI> enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007381_0008_102B8CB9F1355210">
Had General <HI>Braddock</HI> been oppo&s;ed by <HI>French Regulars</HI> only, he would probably have met with little interruption in his progre&s;s; but, as he had to do with the <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who fought in a way he was an intire &s;tranger to, he &s;oon fell a prey into their hands: Nor would numbers have &s;erved him; they would only have given occa&s;ion for a more horrible &s;laughter of men. The plain truth is, <HI>Regular troops,</HI> in this <HI>Wilderne&s;s-country,</HI> are ju&s;t the &s;ame that <HI>irre|gular ones</HI> would be in <HI>Flanders. American irregulars</HI> would ea&s;ily be confounded by <HI>regular troops</HI> in the <HI>open fields</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> and <HI>regular troops</HI> would be as ea&s;ily reduced to the like confu&s;ion by <HI>American irregulars</HI> in the <HI>woods here.</HI></P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean by what I here &s;ay, as tho' we did not need <HI>regular troops,</HI> or could not make u&s;e of them to good pur|po&s;e. For, as <HI>France</HI> has &s;ent over a con&s;iderable number of their <HI>regulars,</HI> it is highly proper there &s;hould be <HI>regulars</HI> to oppo&s;e them; and, in laying &s;eige to their fortifications, <HI>regulars</HI> are the fitte&s;t to be employed: But, as there is no way of marching to the <HI>French fortre&s;&s;es,</HI> or to their <HI>regulars,</HI> either in, or out of them, but thro' the <HI>American woods</HI> and <HI>thickets,</HI> the be&s;t <HI>regular</HI> troops that could be &s;ent us would, with|out all doubt, be attacked in their march; and &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, they would probably be &s;oon de&s;troyed, or obliged to retreat with lo&s;s, not being &s;killed in the <HI>only method</HI> of fighting that would be of any real &s;ervice to them. General <HI>Braddock'</HI>s defeat is a practical in&s;tance that mu&s;t forever &s;ilence all di&s;pute upon this head.</P>
<P>And what is more naturally and obviou&s;ly deducible herefrom than this, that <HI>American irregulars,</HI> in an <HI>American</HI> war, are full as nece&s;&s;ary as <HI>Briti&s;h regulars.</HI> And if <HI>American irregulars</HI> are thus nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be evident, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that it will argue the want of policy, if that is done which has a <HI>direct tendency</HI> to cool their zeal, and damp their &s;pirits; and this mo&s;t certainly will be done, if they are obliged to &s;ee regiments rai&s;ed, upon the <HI>Briti&s;h E&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> even among them&s;elves, with &s;o many officers appointed from home, as almo&s;t wholly to exclude them from being &s;harers in any thing that is either honorable, or profitable. If one of the good effects following upon the <HI>Ohio-defeat,</HI> &s;o inglorious to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> arms, as well as hurtful to their intere&s;t, is not a greater care to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>American</HI> merit, it will not be becau&s;e it is not, in all re&s;pects, fitted to point out the political Wi&s;dom of &s;uch a conduct: Nor, unle&s;s &s;uch a conduct &s;hould be con&s;equent thereupon, can it rea&s;onably be expected, that any military attempts will be carried on here with that re&s;olution, vigor, and &s;pirit, which are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

I may pertinently add to what has been hitherto &s;aid, it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of the <HI>rules and articles for the further governing his Maje&s;ty's forces,</HI> given out the la&s;t year, extending to <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>troops</HI> &s;erving here by <HI>commi&s;&s;ion only from the Governors of the &s;everal pro|vinces,</HI> would not have run exactly in their pre&s;ent form, if the im|portance of the&s;e troops, in an <HI>American</HI> war, had been &s;o thoroughly con&s;idered <HI>then,</HI> as it probably will be <HI>now.</HI> Perhaps, upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, it would not have been thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;o explicit in &s;aying, "that the general or field-officers of the <HI>provincial</HI> troops &s;hall have <HI>no rank</HI> with the general and field-officers who &s;erve by commi&s;&s;ion from us;" or, that "the captain and other inferior of|ficers of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> forces &s;hall, in all duties, <HI>take po&s;t</HI> of the <HI>provincial</HI> officers of the like rank, though their commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be of <HI>elder</HI> date." Such a di&s;tinction, &s;o formally made between <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pro|vincial</HI> officers, however ju&s;t in it &s;elf, may, in pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, be of great di&s;&s;ervice, and certainly will, &s;hould it unhappily prove an oc|ca&s;ion of jealou&s;y, di&s;affection, and contempt, in the&s;e officers towards each other.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjection al&s;o of the <HI>Provincial</HI> troops to <HI>Courts-martial,</HI> "in like manner with the officers and &s;oldiers of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops, when acting in conjunction with them," may probably tend to render the enli&s;tment of &s;oldiers a much greater difficulty, than if they were left to be try'd conformably to the laws of the provinces to which they belong. For it is to be con&s;idered, nine in ten of the men, who mu&s;t compo&s;e our <HI>Provincial</HI> troops, in any important expedition, if to be depended on, are &s;uch as go upon <HI>principle,</HI> from loyalty to their King, love to their country, and a ju&s;t concern for the welfare of their families, and the &s;ecurity of their liberties and e&s;tates; and the&s;e are the men that would be mo&s;t &s;tartled at the thought of being &s;ub|jected to <HI>Martial-law,</HI> as practi&s;ed at home: nor would they ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to come under &s;uch &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>The unhappy event that has lately taken place in <HI>America</HI> is well fitted to convey to the <HI>Mother-Country</HI> ju&s;t Ideas of what is proper to be done here: and it will accordingly, as we may rea&s;onably tru&s;t, be productive of tho&s;e determinations, which &s;hall, in the be&s;t manner, tend to &s;upport the honour of the <HI>Provincial,</HI> as well as <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops, and give them all the weight and encouragement that can be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>You are &s;atisfied, I believe, by this time, that the <HI>Ohio-defeat</HI> is naturally adapted to &s;erve the <HI>American Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in the <HI>end,</HI> however grievous it may be for the <HI>pre&s;ent:</HI> Though I &s;hould not
<PB N="11" REF="007381_0010_102B8CBDAA643028">
do ju&s;tice to <HI>New-England</HI> in general, and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province</HI> in particular, if I did not &s;ugge&s;t my fears, lea&s;t, by means of this di&s;|appointment, they would be &s;ubjected to <HI>one very great hard&s;hip,</HI> un|le&s;s his Maje&s;ty, in his paternal wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, &s;hould do that which will, in a good mea&s;ure, prevent its being &s;o. To explain my &s;elf here.</P>
<P><HI>New-England</HI> in general, and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province</HI> in &s;pecial, are the chief, I may &s;ay the only, &s;ources that may be rely'd on for a &s;upply of effective men to carry into execution any future de&s;igns again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> There are no men in the <HI>American</HI> Colonies &s;o well qualified, or &s;pirited, as the&s;e to engage in war-like enterprizes: And this is &s;o well known, that the <HI>other Colonies,</HI> as well as <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> have their expectations mainly from us. The danger therefore is, le&s;t our men &s;hould be call'd into military &s;ervice beyond our <HI>ability,</HI> as well as <HI>proportion.</HI> This indeed is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-Government only has more men employ'd in the &s;everal expeditions now on foot, than all the other Colonies put together. One full <HI>eighth</HI> part of our people (the flower of them too) are in active &s;ervice at this day, and a greater number of them in <HI>our own pay</HI> than when we undertook the reduction of <HI>Louisbourg.</HI> Such, in truth, is the &s;pirit reigning in the <HI>Province,</HI> that every <HI>third</HI> man, I believe, would be in readine&s;s, upon very &s;hort warning, to engage in an <HI>enter|prize I could name,</HI> if put upon it, and duly encouraged in it. It is therefore obvious, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, <HI>we</HI> &s;hall be <HI>&s;ingularly</HI> liable to have our men taken off from their la|bour in their re&s;pective callings, the effect whereof will be the ri&s;e of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life; an incapacity to pay tho&s;e taxes, which are already <HI>tribled</HI> upon us; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, the &s;topping our <HI>growth</HI> for twenty or thirty years, by the lo&s;s of our young men, ei|ther by death, or their going where they will be expo&s;ed to fewer hard&s;hips, and le&s;s charge.</P>
<P>It is in the power of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> to prevent, in a great mea&s;ure, the&s;e inconveniences, I don't mean by not calling upon us for our men; [this, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>character</HI> of the <HI>Southern</HI> Colonies, may be nece&s;&s;ary] but by employing them at the charge of the <HI>crown;</HI> at the &s;ame time, making us the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> object of his <HI>paternal regards,</HI> in proportion to our greater zeal and activity in the defence of our <HI>Sovereign'</HI>s rights again&s;t the <HI>French-Encroachments.</HI></P>
<P>It does not &s;eem equitable, that <HI>this Province,</HI> becau&s;e more loyal and active than the other Provinces, &s;hould be drain'd of its men, and
<PB N="12" REF="007381_0011_102B8CBF86763C60">
burdened with a weight of charge beyond what we are able to bear. We may, I think, rea&s;onably expect all proper care will be taken to guard again&s;t this: Nor otherwi&s;e will it be long in our power to be of any &s;ervice, either to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> or the other Colonies under his dominion. We &s;hall &s;ink under the burden that is laid upon us, and unavoidably fall into ruin.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving here, though <HI>this Province</HI> has been the <HI>Grand Barrier to all the American Colonies</HI> for more than an hundred years, and has, in that time, expended immen&s;e &s;ums of money, in the wars it has carried on with the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> for the <HI>common</HI> good, as well as its own; yet it has never received the lea&s;t help, in re&s;pect either of men, or money, from any of the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> Governments: Nor has the <HI>Mother-Country,</HI> in all that time, made them a <HI>donation</HI> of &s;o much as <HI>one thou&s;and pounds,</HI> &s;o far as I remember, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their <HI>own proper defence:</HI> Which we take the more hardly, as we have been publickly told, that no le&s;s a &s;um than <HI>ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terl.</HI> was given the la&s;t year to <HI>Virginia,</HI> (and without their a&s;king for it) to encourage them in their attempts again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ohio;</HI> while yet, this is the fir&s;t time they have been called to any difficulty of this &s;ort, or put to any charge worth mentioning. Were we, in <HI>this Province,</HI> to meet with <HI>proportionable encouragement</HI> from home, we &s;hould not think much of any thing we might be called to for the <HI>common</HI> benefit of the <HI>American Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, you think it high time I &s;hould come to a clo&s;e of this letter; but I mu&s;t beg your patience, though I may already have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon it, while I mention to you <HI>what</HI> our <HI>New-England</HI> forces have done this &s;ummer for the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty, and turn|ing the &s;cale in favour of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our lo&s;s at <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P>Let me then congratulate you upon the reduction of all the <HI>French forts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the&s;e <HI>Forts</HI> was much &s;tronger in its make than <HI>Du Que&s;ne,</HI> and defended with more and heavier Cannon; and our troops, while bombarding it, and at work in pre|paring to cannonade it, were attacked, from the woods, by perhaps as great a number of <HI>Indians</HI> as &s;urprized and defeated our army at the <HI>&s;outhward.</HI> And what was the effect? Our <HI>New-England</HI> men, in&s;tead of being affrighten'd by the <HI>Indian's yelling,</HI> and &s;tanding as <HI>marks to be &s;hot at,</HI> while they could do them little or no hurt, took them in their own way, bravely followed them into the woods, and &s;oon oblig'd them to retreat, without ever attempting again to give them the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.</NOTE> at <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and St. <HI>John's River.</HI> In &s;ome complimental addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Governor</HI> of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> NEW-ENGLAND was kept &s;o in|tirely out of view, that a &s;tranger would have gue&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops
<PB N="13" REF="007381_0012_102B8CC228D52000">
only had merited the honour of this exploit: Whereas the plain truth is, it was done by two regiments (of a thou&s;and each) &s;ent from <HI>New-England,</HI> with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of only two or three hundred of his Ma|je&s;ty's <HI>regular</HI> troops. This could not well have been di&s;gui&s;ed, even in a compliment, if a <HI>New-England</HI> officer had had the <HI>chief command,</HI> as we were univer&s;ally led to expect. How the matter came to be otherwi&s;e ordered, I pre&s;ume not to &s;ay: But thus much is certain, the <HI>honour</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> was not thereby advanced, nor the mo&s;t likely &s;tep taken to promote his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in future enli&s;tments. I have no view in what I now &s;ay to &s;ugge&s;t the lea&s;t reflection on Col. <HI>Monckton;</HI> for, by all accounts, he is every way equal to the place he holds, and has behaved excellently well in it: But it mu&s;t be tho't rea&s;onable, that <HI>New-England</HI> &s;hould have had the <HI>honour</HI> of a <HI>Chief-Commander</HI> from among her own &s;ons; e&s;pecially as it is known here, that they enli&s;ted upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, and would have been per&s;uaded upon no other.</P>
<P>I need not ob&s;erve to you the importance of the&s;e acqui&s;itions in <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> They are alone a full counter-balance to our lo&s;s at the <HI>&s;outhward;</HI> and you will ea&s;ily be di&s;po&s;ed to think &s;o, when I have told you that the <HI>Neutral-French,</HI> as they are called, are, by this means, intirely &s;ubjected to our Command. And accordingly tran&s;port-ve&s;&s;els, (they having refu&s;ed to &s;wear allegiance to his maje&s;ty <HI>George</HI> our gracious Sovereign) have been taken up, and &s;ailed from hence, to carry them out of <HI>that part</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and to place them in <HI>others</HI> where they may be le&s;s dangerous and trouble&s;ome. I &s;uppo&s;e, by this time, <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> is emptied of its <HI>French-inha|bitants,</HI> and thereby &s;ecured to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> crown more effectually than ever. How galling mu&s;t this be to <HI>France!</HI> What a va&s;t di&s;appoint|ment! when &s;he doubtle&s;s expected the <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of all this, as &s;he had &s;ent over &s;o great a number of troops, and with a de&s;ign to accompli&s;h <HI>that</HI> on <HI>her &s;ide,</HI> which we have done on <HI>our's.</HI></P>
<P>We thankfully a&s;cribe it, under the &s;miles of providence, to the &s;ea&s;onable arrival of Admiral <HI>Bo&s;cawen,</HI> with &s;o powerful a naval force, that the <HI>Gallic Scheme,</HI> &s;o far as it related to <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> has been intirely defeated. And &s;uch has been the vigilant and prudent conduct of this <HI>brave Commander,</HI> and &s;uch the di&s;tre&s;&s;es ari&s;ing herefrom to a <HI>certain place,</HI> that it might, perhaps, &s;hould permi&s;&s;ion be granted, be &s;oon put into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hands, to the intire Ruin of the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t in <HI>America.</HI></P>

I don't think I &s;hall be too ha&s;ty, if I congratulate you al&s;o on the <HI>virtual</HI> or <HI>con&s;tructive</HI> conque&s;t even of <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> it&s;elf on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> in what Major General <HI>Shirley,</HI> our Governor, has already done to cut off the communication between <HI>Canada,</HI> and that <HI>fort.</HI> I own, I was not without pain, when I knew his <HI>excellency</HI> was going in per&s;on upon the <HI>Niagara-expedition,</HI> and with no more than about 2500 men, as it might rea&s;onably be expected the <HI>French</HI> would be alarmed at an attempt to take from them the <HI>grand Key</HI> to all the Lakes, and whole Country extending to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi;</HI> and my fears were heightened up|on the advantage, General <HI>Braddock'</HI>s defeat would give them, the more powerfully to oppo&s;e him. But, by the wi&s;e and timely care of his <HI>Excellency,</HI> the Engli&s;h <HI>O&s;wego-fort,</HI> upon the Margin of the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> was &s;o enlarged and &s;trengthened as to di&s;courage a thou&s;and <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> from making an attack upon it, tho' they were collected together, near the fort, for this purpo&s;e:&mdash;Be&s;ides which, <HI>He</HI> has for &s;ome time had, thro' the laborious diligence of a number of <HI>New-England</HI> carpenters, well guarded and defended while at their work, three well arm'd ve&s;&s;els cruizing in the <HI>lake;</HI> and by this time 2 more are built, and join'd with them; which make a very formidable &s;quadron for a &s;mall <HI>&s;ea,</HI> as <HI>Ontario</HI> may be called, tho' detached from the <HI>Ocean</HI> between 2 and 300 miles at the neare&s;t di&s;tance. And, by means of this &s;quadron, he has it in his power to prevent an attempt again&s;t <HI>O&s;wego</HI> by canonading or bombarding, without which it will be an ea&s;y thing to hold it again&s;t any number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> that can be bro't to take it. And by this &s;quadron al&s;o he has rendered it impractica|ble (as may be &s;een by only looking on a map of this part of <HI>America</HI>) for the <HI>Canadians</HI> to convey artillery, ammunition, or any other &s;tores, for the defence of their encroachments on the back of our &s;outhern Co|lonies. Fort <HI>Du Que&s;ne</HI> mu&s;t, for this rea&s;on, &s;oon fall into our hands, and without much trouble, be&s;ides what may be called for in watching the <HI>lake.</HI></P>
<P>Had General <HI>Braddock</HI> made it his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ecure the command of lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> which he might ea&s;ily have done &s;oon enough to have &s;topt the <HI>force</HI> that was &s;ent from <HI>Canada</HI> to <HI>Du Que&s;ne,</HI> that fort mu&s;t have been &s;urrendered to him upon demand; and had he gone this way to it, greater part of that va&s;t &s;um might have been &s;aved to the nation, which was expended in making a waggon road, thro' the woods and mountains, the way he went. Why he went this way I pre&s;ume not to enquire; much le&s;s would I &s;ay, that he was above thinking, any plan of operation could be better than his own.</P>

It is impo&s;&s;ible to determine at this di&s;tance, whether his Excellency General <HI>Shirley</HI> will directly endeavour the reduction of <HI>Niagara-Fort.</HI> He is wi&s;e, and cautious; and will, I believe, do nothing upon this head, under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, unle&s;s there is the utmo&s;t probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s. It would not give me any concern, if he &s;hould make no immedi|ate attempt upon this fort. For as he has now got the command of Lake <HI>Ontario,</HI> the <HI>grand point</HI> is gained. The <HI>key of communication</HI> is in <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> hands; and if a good u&s;e is made of it, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be the intire de&s;truction of the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t on the back-parts of our <HI>&s;outhern</HI> Colonies, in a little time, and with little pains.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Crown-Point</HI> expedition; its effect is &s;till altogether in the womb of providence; though it might have been determined long ago, and in our favour, humanly &s;peaking, had not a delay been render'd unavoidable, by the obligation which was laid upon Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> to go to <HI>Maryland</HI> [a curious &s;pecimen, among other things we have &s;een, of the &s;ignal advantage of the lately propo&s;ed <HI>Union</HI> of the Pro|vinces] to &s;ettle with General <HI>Braddock</HI> the plan of action for the &s;um|mer.

The troops from <HI>France,</HI> not intercepted by Ad|miral <HI>Bo&s;cowen,</HI> may, before this time, be po&s;ted in the mo&s;t advanta|geous &s;ituation for the defence of that place: And &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, our <HI>New-England</HI> men may be called to difficult &s;ervice.
