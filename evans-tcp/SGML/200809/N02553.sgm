For to this Effect was the Confe&s;|&s;ion of one, when he was had before the Rulers.

Let Men account of you whatever they may, yet if you are tho&s;e true Wor|&s;hippers of God, you will not be a&s;hamed to confe&s;s it before the Children of Men; tho' you may be &s;corn'd and abus'd; when you are &s;en&s;ible that you are tho&s;e that wor&s;hip God, and are right, will not be

But if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that you come to be Sufferers, and to be had before the Rulers, and to be fal&s;ly accu&s;ed in divers re&s;pects, as the Followers of Chri&s;t were in the Apo&s;tles Days yet dare not to deny that you are the Wor&s;hippers of God. And we find Chri&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in|forming the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> at <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well, which way to wor&s;hip God, and let us &s;ee that we are found in this way, is acceptable to God, in our Wor&s;hip and Service unto him this Day, and all our Days, that we may have the Spirit, and then no Que&s;tion at all, but when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to put a Period to our Days here, we &s;hall find acceptance with him: For though we may be rejected by the Children of Men, and &s;lighted, and ill u&s;ed, yet tho&s;e that are found true wor&s;hip|pers of God, let them go under what Deno|mination what&s;oever, they &s;hall find accep|tance.

And it is the de&s;ire of my Soul, although many of the Children of Men &s;o &s;candalize it, that People wait for the Spirit of God, and they dare not Preach, and they dare not Pray, untill they feel and are abilitated by his Power Divine, for we know not how to Pray as we ought, but the Spirit in us with &s;ighs and groanings, that may not be heard by Mortals, being yet Divine; but he hears, and he knows, and he knows in who&s;e Heart it is to Fear and to Serve him. I hope there is a num|ber though &s;mall, a number gather'd toge|ther, that are de&s;irous to wor&s;hip the Lord in their Days and Generations.</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid before of the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> by <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well; when we find our ble&s;&s;ed Lord came to her, at that &s;ame time we may find that they fell into a Ca&s;e, or as it were a Di&s;cour&s;e about the wor&s;hip of God and the like. And he inform'd her as we may read, if I'm not mi&s;taken, in the fourth Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> that the true
<PB N="6" REF="003028_0007_0FEFAE6620AE4D70">
Wor&s;hippers &s;hould wor&s;hip the Father, in Spirit and in Truth, and &s;uch was God &s;eeking to wor&s;hip Him: He further in|form'd her of all that ever &s;he had done, and &s;he went away convinced, that it was our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour; and &s;he was made to make &s;ome Publication of it, and &s;he went away. &mdash;<HI>And come &s;ee a Man that told me all that ever I did.</HI> Well, &s;he &s;eem'd to be in earne&s;t, and invites and many Be|liev'd, not only becau&s;e of her &s;aying it, but they went and &s;aw for them&s;elves. Now what we invite the Children of Men to, is to make &s;ome proof, and come and &s;ee for them&s;elves, if they have not &s;omething that will be of force unto them all; they will have the Spirit, and he will In&s;truct them for that end. They have had a Spirit that has been contrary to the Divine Will and Plea&s;ure of God; for he indeed does &s;how unto Men and Women, what influences them in order that they may for&s;ake the evil of it; and cea&s;e to do evil and learn to do well. And although their Souls have been as Scar|let, and as deep Crim&s;on, yet upon cea&s;ing to do evil, and learning to do well, he will wa&s;h them as white as Snow, and as Wool: may we all come to be wa&s;h'd, from the evil

of our doings; for we mu&s;t confe&s;s we have all &s;inned, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, and come &s;hort of the Glory of God. Therefore this Remnant have apply'd them&s;elves to the great Phy&s;ician, who is willing to pardon the Children of Men, and to blot out their Iniquities; and now being wa&s;hed, and now being clean&s;ed, and now being &s;anctified, for as we may read in the Scriptures of Truth, <HI>know ye not that no unrighteous one &s;hall inherit God's Kingdom.</HI> And he reckons up, Evil-doers, Idolaters, Effeminate, and Adulterers, yet &s;ays he, <HI>&s;uch were &s;ome of you:</HI> But yet, had the Lord mercy on &s;uch, that were not fit for his kingdom? Yes, <HI>for now are ye wa&s;hed, and now are ye clean&s;ed,</HI> &amp;c. Here was a &s;piritual work manife&s;ted unto them, and we mu&s;t come to, and now being clean|&s;ed, and now being born of the Spirit, and now being born of Water, and now being clean&s;ed, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall never be fit for God's kingdom, according to the foregoing Chapter, as we may read in the 3d. of <HI>John,</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord inform'd <HI>Nichodemus</HI> that was a Ruler, and that came to Je&s;us by night, if I mi&s;take not he inform'd him, and told him that <HI>unle&s;s a Man was born again, he cou'd not &s;ee the kingdom of God.

&s;aith <HI>Nichodemus, Can a Man enter a &s;econd time into his Mothers Womb</HI>? It &s;eems he was carnally minded, and apply'd the &s;peech of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord carnally, and then he fur|ther explains it, <HI>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. Now I believe many have had the Work of the Spirit of God on their Hearts, as well as he; May we all apply our &s;elves to him for all our Doubts, that he would teach us the way we &s;hould walk in, and if we do, he will no doubt dicover to every individual of us what way we may come to be born again.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my &s;elf I had my Education a|mong&s;t tho&s;e called Quakers, yet when the Lord was pleas'd by his great mercy to vi&s;it me, and to bring me under a concern to know what I &s;hou'd do to inherit eternal life; I was ready to &s;ubmit to every thing that I was made to know was my Duty, and if it was any outward Ceremony my Parents came &s;hort of, yet I knew I mu&s;t do my work my &s;elf: thus when I read that pa&s;&s;age of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord to <HI>Nichodemus,</HI> I was ready to &s;ubmit to the Ceremony of Water, which can only wa&s;h the outward Man, from hence 'twas practic'd from him, and it was the &s;ame that had done it, and tho&s;e that
<PB N="9" REF="003028_0010_0FEFAE7171AD8B68">
were commanded to do it took it from Chri&s;t: And thus I was for &s;ome time, and apply'd my &s;elf unto God that I might not mi&s;s of the &s;alvation of my Soul. And I de|&s;ire none to take up Religion from Educati|on, of what Form &s;oever, but that we may know of our being fitted for God's king|dom, perhaps we &s;hall never be fit for his kingdom. I hope there are many of the Children of Men thus informed, and as you keep up that appearance you have in your &s;elves, although &s;ome times it &s;eems very &s;mall, even like a grain of Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, yet if you have Faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t which teacheth you at times and &s;ea&s;ons, to deny all ungodline&s;s and lu&s;ts of the World. We find the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was very po&s;itive when he wrote to <HI>Titus,</HI> and &s;ays, <HI>the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all Men,</HI> he will's not the Death of a Sinner, but had rather that he turn and live, and the good Spirit of God teacheth you <HI>to deny worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righ|teou&s;ly, and godly</HI>; may you keep the teach|ings of it, you need no teaching but the ho|ly anointing in you, teacheth you, and there|fore it is that we call upon the Children of Men, and invite them to come and &s;ee and

live. I remember I &s;aw one that was very ancient in years &amp; &s;tricken, &amp; he had lived to that time he had lo&s;t his &s;ight, and he had a vi&s;itation, and he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf a little before his departure, He was not one that made Profe&s;&s;ion with us as a People, yet he humbled him&s;elf before the Lord, and was made to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Sins of his Youth, and all that ever he had done was brought to his remembrance. I wi&s;h the Children of Men would con&s;ider, and apply them|&s;elves to God for mercy, and not ju&s;tify them&s;elves in any thing &s;hort of a Ju&s;tificati|on in the &s;ight of God. I have known &s;uch a one, and I hope and believe there are ma|ny that have apply'd them&s;elves to God; I can &s;ay, that while I &s;peak unto you, I have applyed my &s;elf unto the Lord; the Lord have mercy on me, the Lord wa&s;h me, and make me clean. I was &s;en&s;ible he was to lead me by his judgments, and as I waited on the Lord I can &s;ay, that it was the com|fort of the Lord when I was made &s;en&s;ible, that when the wicked Man that has liv'd unrighteou&s;ly, turns from his unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, all his wickedne&s;s that he hath done &s;hall not be remember'd. I vow my &s;pirit was humbled before the Lord, and many
<PB N="11" REF="003028_0012_0FEFAE758E103840">
times when I am employed my &s;elf in the A&s;&s;emblies of God's People, I was de&s;irous of God the Lord to &s;earch me and to prove me: It was the language of a good Man in ancient Days, that God would &s;earch him and try him. And although they may be accounted Hereticks, and the way they Wor&s;hip call'd Here&s;y, yet I find for I can &s;ay it is not my manner, to prepare any thing for to deliver to any People, but to wait on the Lord, and this Pa&s;&s;age of ho|ly Scripture came into my Remembrance, how that one made a Profe&s;&s;ion, in the way which they called Here&s;y.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e you be tho&s;e that thus wor|&s;hip the God of your Fathers, I believe that many have been godly concerned, when they have believed that they might wor|&s;hip God acceptably.

I remember the Apo&s;tle <HI>Stephen</HI> when he was &s;toned, and per&s;ecuted; there was a Spirit in him, &amp; he pray'd, <HI>Lord, lay not this Sin unto their charge,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="003028_0013_0FEFAE77F9AC09C0">
And I have charitable Thoughts that &s;ome have been ignorant, and hardly knew what they did, yet ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord Truth does &s;pread, and is predominant: And if you do as tho&s;e that are Profe&s;&s;ors ought to do, do but live an&s;werable to your Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, according to the influence of the Light you make a Profe&s;&s;ion of, you will be as Way-marks to the Children of Men. For we are People that make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Light of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that has light|ed every Man that has come into the World, though &s;ome &s;ay it was in&s;ufficient, but the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays it was not in&s;uffi|cient; but the Grace of God, he might have &s;aid the Light of Chri&s;t, hath appear|ed unto all Men; and what did it di&s;cover? why it teacheth them to deny all Ungod|line&s;s, and worldly Lu&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> May you keep the teachings of it, and may I, is the de&s;ire of my Soul, when&s;oever we appear before the Lord. May we call upon him, and breath unto him, that he would abili|tate us, to perform acceptable Service unto him; &s;o I de&s;ire for my own Soul that I may thus wor&s;hip God aright, which is per|form'd in Spirit and in Truth, as I have mention'd before, for God &s;eeks, &s;uch to

<P>I Would in Charity hope, and do believe, that the Intent and De&s;igns of our Mind generally is; I &s;peak unto &s;uch as are come unto Years of under&s;tanding, we all intend one way, and the Intent of our Minds ge|nerally is, that, when the Period of time, &s;hall be put unto us, and unto our being here, to enjoy a Heavenly Inheritance; I &s;ay, I cannot choo&s;e but in Charity thus be|lieve, thus all de&s;ign undoubtedly, and &s;ince the Ca&s;e is &s;o, that we are de&s;ign'd one way in our judgments and thoughts, that is at la&s;t to obtain Heaven and Happine&s;s, let our Names be what it will, and let your

Forms of Religion be what they will, I make no doubt but this is your de&s;ign for all. We are all undoubtedly of this Opi|nion, although I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that various is the judgments of the Children of Men to obtain it. You are &s;en&s;ible Men and Wo|men, of you, I am &s;peaking to, I make no doubt, and therefore you can a&s;&s;ent to what I &s;ay in this re&s;pect, I make no que&s;tion at all.</P>
<P>And indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s to, that it is commendable for all the Children of Men to be thus engaged, con&s;idering the &s;ad lo&s;s, all of us &s;hall light of that mi&s;s this fore|mentioned Happine&s;s. We are of this Opi|nion no doubt, and we believe that Woe will be the Portion of tho&s;e that mi&s;s of this end; and therefore it is the wi&s;dom of all the Children of Men, that de&s;ign to take wi&s;e &s;teps to obtain this: for I will tell you Friends, that all that have had experience in this Travail, and all that are Witne&s;&s;es, and all that have had any a&s;&s;urance of a better World, they have had no &s;mall exerci&s;e here; it has been a narrow Path though all have travail'd in it, that have come to any a&s;&s;u|rance of this glorious inheritance. And therefore I would have us be engaged in this as much as in us lies.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003028_0018_0FEFAE8538FDEB88">On the other hand, though we cannot &s;ee alike in &s;undrys, and agree in &s;undrys, yet for all that we may dare to maintain Cha|rity unto one another, &s;o far as truth will allow. I can truly &s;ay, I envy no Man that cannot &s;ee as I do, I pity all that I &s;ee out of the way, and my Soul mourns many times for them, I am far from having any bitter &s;pirit again&s;t any Man, for &s;ince the Ca&s;e is &s;o to all that mi&s;s this way, it will be enough for them, to mi&s;s what they expected in another World: And it is pity, that any &s;hould be &s;o malicious, again&s;t tho&s;e that cannot &s;ay with them, for they are &s;en&s;ible Men as I &s;aid before, and he mu&s;t have &s;ome ground for his Belief.

And therefore it is very hard for Men to bear hard one upon a|nother, becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee alike, for I am &s;en&s;ible that what mo&s;t Men have differ'd mo&s;t about, has been &s;ince the want

of the Spirit, and &s;ince the Apo&s;tacy, and &s;ince the Church has gone away, and &s;ince it went into the Wilderne&s;s. It has been about light things in them&s;elves, and it has not been about the life of Religion. Ma|ny have been &s;o zealous as to kill one a|nother about Religion, and &s;ome of them have been only about the outward things in Religion, as you may read in ancient Hi&s;tory. You know this very well, and it may be better than I can tell you; yet I have had &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;hare in the Church-Hi&s;tory, and I have ob&s;erved that it has been commonly, that the difference has been about &s;hadows that would not &s;ave Men, and that Men might be &s;aved without, and therefore I would de&s;cend in|to a con&s;ideration with you now, about the&s;e &s;hadows that Men have been &s;o con|cerned about, and therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider the Thirtieth Chapter of <HI>Jeremiah, The Lord &s;aith by the Mouth of his Prophet, behold the day is come &s;aith the Lord, and I will make a new Covenant with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the Hou&s;e of Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Wilderne&s;s, which Covenant they broke.</HI>
And here you &s;ee what he &s;ays, <HI>I will write

<P>You are Men that read the holy Scrip|tures, and what this Covenant is, the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us, in the 9th. Chapter, which &s;tood only in Meats, and Drinks, and divers Wa&s;hings, and carnal Ordinan|ces: And here you &s;ee it was a new Cove|nant that was to be made; the fir&s;t was that that con&s;i&s;ted in the Ten Precepts, written and engraven in Stone, and was carry'd into the Ark in the Wilderne&s;s, in that Ark was the fir&s;t Covenant. It was an external out|ward Covenant, a Covenant of works, and therefore the Lord &s;aith, <HI>Behold the day is come, and I will make a new Covenant with the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> &amp;c. I believe that this was the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation that was there pointed out in this new Covenant, and I &s;uppo&s;e that all agree in this Go&s;pel Day that we are under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. That, that was written and engraven on Stone you &s;ee that was done away, there|fore the fir&s;t Mini&s;tration. But the &s;econd was the Mini&s;tration of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and exceeded the &s;ame in glory. Therefore the new Covenant is that I would a little &s;peak
<PB N="20" REF="003028_0021_0FEFAE8D6540DD80">
to, that you may know where this mu&s;t be if ever you are acquainted with it: you mu&s;t come to this new Covenant and well where is it, the Apo&s;tle tells you in the &s;e|cond Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> and the &s;e|cond Chapter. He was writing to the Church, and he writes unto them after this manner; <HI>Ye are our Epi&s;tle, read and known of all Men,</HI> &amp;c. Not the Tables of Stone as the fir&s;t Covenant was, but the fle&s;hly Ta|bles of the Heart, is now I believe this new Di&s;pen&s;ation where the Covenant is, for God will write his Law on their Hearts, and they &s;hall not &s;ay every one to his Neigh|bour and to his Brother, <HI>know ye the Lord? for ye &s;hall all know me even from the lea&s;t unto the greate&s;t, &s;aith the Lord, and I will teach them of my ways.</HI> And here the Lord becomes a Teacher unto his People under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>But I will return a little again unto, what the Author &s;ays unto the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> this fir&s;t Covenant con&s;i&s;ted in divers Meats, and Wa&s;hings, and carnal Ordinances, that is in carnal Ordinances impo&s;ed on the Children of Men, until the time of the Reformation.

Well Friends, I believe that the fir&s;t Cove|nant in point of Obligation is done away in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. He blotted out the Hand, writing of Ordinances, and he took it out of the way and nail'd it unto his Cro&s;s, yea the fir&s;t Covenant of Ordinances cea&s;ed there; for you know that what, is nailed is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be fa&s;tned, and to be fixed, and to be de&s;igned to &s;tay there. This fir&s;t Covenant did con&s;i&s;t in outward perfor|mance, but this con&s;i&s;ts in a more Heavenly and Spiritual &s;ub&s;tance, for I will tell you Friends, all the Ordinances of God, in&s;titu|ted by God under this fir&s;t Covenant, were very noble Figures, and Shadows: nay be|fore the Go&s;pel was preached; by the&s;e di|ver&s;e Wa&s;hings and carnal Ordinances. For I &s;uppo&s;e you will confe&s;s that there was no Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin, nor Supplication by the&s;e, for the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the blood of Bulls, and Goats, and the a&s;hes of an Heifer to purge away Sin,</HI> there was no Wa&s;hing by the&s;e that were but legal Purifications, they did not wa&s;h the Souls of Men, for that was repre|&s;ented by the&s;e outward Signs and Figures under that Di&s;pen&s;ation, and therefore I
<PB N="22" REF="003028_0023_0FEFAE8F37F52E18">
believe during the time of that legal Di&s;pen&s;ation, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e things which were a Pattern.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Writer had particular Bu&s;ine&s;s which oblig'd him to omit taking down the latter part of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
