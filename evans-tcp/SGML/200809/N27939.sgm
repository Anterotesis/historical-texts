<HEAD>BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS OF GEN. GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQ. <HI>Late President of the United States, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born Febru|ary 2nd. 1732, in the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, in We&s;tmoreland county, in the &s;tate of Virginia. His ance&s;tors were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property in England, near Cave, in the ea&s;t riding of York&s;hire, which they &s;old, and came over to America, in the year 1657, and purcha&s;ed lands in king George's county, Virginia. His father, Mr. Augu&s;tus Wa&s;hing|ton, was the &s;econd in decent after their emi|gration, and had a numerous offspring. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of large property, and of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed reputation. George was his third &s;on, and the fir&s;t fruit of his &s;econd marriage. He received his education from a private tutor, under, whom he acquired a knowledge of the la|tin language &s;ufficient for the ordinary purpo&s;es
<PB N="6" REF="037222_0004_100C97BA6FAD8D18">of life, his mother-tongue grammatically, and the elements of mathematics, which he, in his ri&s;ing years, carefully improved by practical experiments in topographical and military plans. When he was but ten years of age, his father died, and at fifteen he was entered a mid&s;hipman on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war then &s;tationed on the coa&s;t of Virginia. But after his baggage had been packed up for embarkation, the plan was abandoned in obedience to the calls of maternal affection. For &s;everal years after he quitted his tutor, the learning he had acquired was much im|proved by a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;tudy, and he par|ticularly applied him&s;elf to the practical parts of &s;urveying, a knowledge of which was then, as it is now, very important and nece&s;&s;ary to men of landed property in every part of the American continent. His merits in this branch of knowledge, occa&s;ioned him being nominated Surveyor to a certain di&s;trict in Virginia, an appointment rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">editable than lucrative; but which afforded him ad|vantageous opportunities, particularly an ac|quaintance with the country, the properties of lands, and the &s;ituations and direction of creeks and rivers, and it enabled him to make a choice of &s;ome valuable tracts of land for &s;ub&s;equent purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037222_0004_100C97BA6FAD8D18">
After his father died, the charge of the family devolved on his elde&s;t brother, a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing talents; who, at that time, was a captain under admiral Ver|non, in the colonial troops, employed in the expedition again&s;t Carthagena; upon his re|turn, having come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his patrimonial e&s;tates, in honour of his admi|ral, from whom he had received many civi|lities he named his new man&s;ion <HI>Mount-Ver|non.</HI> He was afterwards made adjutant-ge|neral of the militia of Virginia, but did not long &s;urvive, and on his demi&s;e (notwith|&s;tanding there were heirs of an elder branch, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare of the patrimony) the elde&s;t &s;on by the &s;econd marriage, inherited the part upon which that &s;ent now &s;tands, and a con&s;iderable landed property attached to it.</P>
<P>At the death of his brother, the vacant of|fice of adjutant-general, was, in con&s;equence of the encrea&s;ed population and exten&s;ive limits of the colony, divided into three di&s;tricts, and the <HI>future Hero of America,</HI> before he was twenty years of age, began his military ca|reer, by an appointment to the tank of major in that department.</P>
<P>In 1753, an event occurred, which called his abilities into more active public notice.
<PB N="8" REF="037222_0005_100C97BD31FE04F8">The jealou&s;ies of the French and Engli&s;h governments were at their height. Encroach|ments were reported to have been made by the former from their &s;ettlements in Canada, on the frontier territories of the Briti&s;h co|lonies, along the rivers Ohio and de Boeuf, &mdash;Orders were received from England, by the governor and council of Virginia, to repel by force the&s;e encroachments; in con&s;equence of which, lieutenant-governor Dinwiddie di&s;|patched young major Wa&s;hington, with ple|nary powers to a&s;certain the facts, treat with the Indians, and warn the French to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t from the inroads they were making, in direct violation of the treaties then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns. This mi&s;&s;ion he performed with &s;ingular indu&s;try, intelli|gence and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The appointment of major Wa&s;hington was deemed a circum&s;tance &s;omewhat extra|ordinary at that period; it was &s;aid that a youth unacquainted with the enlarged com|merce of the world, unexperienced in politi|cal concerns, appeared to be unfit to be em|ployed to conduct a negociation, wherein &s;ubjects of the greate&s;t importance were in|volved: It was very true that the &s;ubjects were important, for they &s;hortly after be|came the origin of a war between the two
<PB N="9" REF="037222_0005_100C97BD31FE04F8">nations, which raged for many years, and extended throughout every part of the globe, and which ended in the final expul&s;ion of the French from the continent.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who had formed &s;uch &s;uperfical notions of the major were in the end deceiv|ed by the &s;ucce&s;s and abilities manife&s;ted through the whole tran&s;action. This having been the fir&s;t effort of that career which has terminated with &s;o much &s;plendor in hi&s;tory, and honour and happine&s;s to him&s;elf and his country. It will be plea&s;ing to peru&s;e his journal, given in as a report of his proceed|ings to governor Dinwiddie of Virginia, on that occa&s;ion; it is highly illu&s;trative of that activity and penetration which have &s;igna|lized his character&mdash;On a more exten&s;ive theatre, at a &s;ub&s;equent period, we &s;hall give it to our readers from an authentic &s;ource.</P>

<HEAD>Major GEORGE WASHINGTON's JOURNAL, <HI>Sent by the Hon.</HI> Robert Dinwiddle, <HI>Esq. his Maje&s;ty's lieutenant governor, and com|mander in chief of Virginia, to the com|mandant of the French forces on the Ohio.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WEDNESDAY, October 31&s;t, 1753.</P>
<P>I was commi&s;&s;ioned and appointed by the
<PB N="10" REF="037222_0006_100C97BF63E4CC08">Hon. Robert Dinwiddie, E&s;q. governor, &amp;c. of Virginia, to vi&s;it and deliver a letter to the commandant of the French forces on the Ohio, and &s;et out on the intended journey the &s;ame day: The next, I arrived at Fre|derick&s;burg, and engaged Mr. Jacob Van|braam, to be my French interpreter; and proceeded with him to Alexandria, where we provided nece&s;&s;aries. From thence we went to Winche&s;ter, and got baggage, hor&s;es, &amp;c. and from thence we pur&s;ued the new road to Wills Creek, where we arrived the 14th of November.</P>
<P>Here I engaged Mr Gi&s;t to pilot us out, and al&s;o hired four others as &s;ervitors. Bar|naby Currin and John Mac Quire, Indian traders, Henry Steward, and William Jen|kins; and in company with tho&s;e per&s;ons left the inhabitants the next day.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive rains and va&s;t quantity of &s;now which had fallen, prevented our reach|ing Mr. Frazier's, an Indian trader at the mouth of Turtle Creek, on Monongahela ri|ver, till Thur&s;day the 22d. We were in|formed here, that expre&s;&s;es had been &s;ent a few days before to the traders down the river, to acquaint them with the French ge|nere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> death, and the return of the major <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the French army into winter quarters.
<PB N="11" REF="037222_0006_100C97BF63E4CC08">The waters were quite impa&s;&s;able, without &s;wimming our hor&s;es; which obliged us to get the loan of a canoe from Frazier, and to &s;end Barnaby Currin, and Henry Stewart, down the Monongahela, with our baggage, to meet us at the forks of the Ohio, about ten miles, there to cro&s;s the Aligany <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ohio and Alligany are the &s;ame river.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As I got down before the canoe, I &s;pent &s;ome time in viewing the rivers, and the land in the Fork, which I think extremely well &s;itu|ated for a fort, as it has the ab&s;olute command of both rivers. The land at the point is 20 or 25 feet above the common &s;urface of the water; and a con&s;iderable bottom of flat well-timbered land all around it, very convenient for building: The rivers are each a quarter of a mile, or more a cro&s;s, and run here very near at right angles: Aligany bearing N. E. and Monongahela S. E. The former of the&s;e two is a very rapid and &s;wift running water; the other deep and &s;till, without any percep|tible fall.</P>
<P>About two miles from this on the South Ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, at the place where the Ohio company intended to erect a fort, lives Shingi&s;s, King of the Delawares: We called upon him to invite him to council at the Loggs Town.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037222_0007_100C97C1B1A8EBD0">
As I had taken a good deal of notice ye&s;|terday of the &s;ituation at the Forks, my cu|rio&s;ity led me to examine this more particu|larly, and I think it greatly inferior, either for defence or advantages; e&s;pecially the lat|ter: For a fort at the Forks would be e|qually well &s;ituated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela; which runs up to our &s;ettlements, and is ex|tremely well de&s;igned for water carriage, as it is of a deep &s;till nature. Be&s;ides a fort at the Fork might be built at much lefs ex|pen&s;e than at the other place.</P>
<P>Nature has well contrived this lower place for water defence; but the hill whereon it mu&s;t &s;tand being about a quarter of a mile in length, and then de&s;cending gradually on the land &s;ide, will render it difficult and very expen&s;ive, to make a &s;ufficient forti|fication there. The whole flat upon the hill mu&s;t be taken in, the &s;ide next the de&s;cent made extremely high, or el&s;e the hill it&s;elf cut away: Otherwi&s;e, the enemy may rai&s;e batteries within that di&s;tance without being expo&s;ed to a &s;ingle &s;hot from the fort.</P>
<P>Shingi&s;s attended us to the Loggs Town, where we arrived between &s;un &s;etting and dark, the 25th day after I left William&s;burg.
<PB N="13" REF="037222_0007_100C97C1B1A8EBD0">We travelled over &s;ome extreme good and bad land, to get to this place.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came into town, I went to Monakatoocha (as the half king was out at his hunting cabbin on little Beaver Creek, about 15 miles off) and informed him by John Davi&s;on my Indian interpreter, that I was &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the French general; and was ordered to call upon the &s;achems of the &s;ix nations, to acquaint them with it. I gave him a &s;tring of wampum, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of Indian Money; al&s;o given as a pre&s;ent or mark of friendship.</NOTE> and a twi&s;t of tobacco, and de&s;ired him to &s;end for the half king; which he promi&s;ed to do by a runner in the morning, and for other &s;a|chems. I invited him and the other great men pre&s;ent, to my tent, where they &s;tayed about an hour and returned.</P>
<P>According to the be&s;t ob&s;ervations I could make, Mr. Giff's new &s;ettlement (which we pa&s;&s;ed by) bears about W. N. W. 70 miles, from Wills Creek, Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50 miles from that: and from thence to the Loggs Town, the cour&s;e is nearly we&s;t about 18 or 20 miles: So that the whole di&s;tance, as we
<PB N="14" REF="037222_0008_100C97C39D660FE0">went and computed it, is at lea&s;t 135 or 140 miles from our back inhabitants.</P>
<P>25th. Came to town four of ten French|men who had de&s;erted from a company at the Ku&s;ku&s;kas, which lies at the mouth of this river. I got the following account from them. They were &s;ent from New-Orleans with 100 men, and 8 canoe loads of provi|&s;ions to this place; where they expected to have met the &s;ame number of men, from the forts on this &s;ide of Lake Erie, to convoy them and the &s;tores up, who were not ar|rived when they run off.</P>
<P>I enquired into the &s;ituation of the French, on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, their number, and what forts they had built. They informed me, that there were four &s;mall forts between New-Orleans and the Black I&s;lands, garris|oned with about 30 or 40 men, and a few &s;mall pieces in each: That at New Orleans, which is near the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, there are 35 companies, of 40 men cach, with a pretty &s;trong fort mounting 8 carri|age guns; and at the Black I&s;lands there are &s;everal companies and a fort with 6 guns. The Black I&s;lands are about 130 leagues a|bove the mouth of the Ohio, which is about 350 above New-Orleans. They al&s;o ac|quainted me, that there was a &s;mall palli&s;a|doed
<PB N="15" REF="037222_0008_100C97C39D660FE0">fort on the Ohio, at the mouth of the Obai&s;h, about 60 leagues from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ip|pi. The Obai&s;h <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or Waba&s;h, written by the French, Quabach.</NOTE> heads near the we&s;t end of Lake Erie, and affords the communication between the French on Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and tho&s;e on the Lakes. The&s;e de&s;erters came up from the lower Shannoah Town with one Brown, an Indian trader, and were going to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>About 3 o'clock this evening the half king came to town. I went up and invited him with Davi&s;on, privately, to my tent; and de&s;ired him to relate &s;ome of the parti|culars of his journey to the French com|mandant, and reception there. Al&s;o to give me an account of the ways and di&s;tance. He told me that the neare&s;t and levelle&s;t way was now impa&s;a&s;able, by rea&s;on of many large meiry &s;avannas; that we mu&s;t be obliged to go by Venango, and &s;hould not get to the near fort under five or fix nights &s;leep, good travelling. When he went to the fort, he &s;aid he was received in a very &s;tern manner by the late commander; who a&s;ked him very abruptly, what he had came about, and to declare his bu&s;ine&s;s: which he &s;aid he did in the following &s;peech:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037222_0009_100C97C5986DDC48">
"Fathers, I am come to tell you your own &s;peeches; what your own mouths have de|clared. Fathers, you, in former days, &s;et a &s;ilver ba&s;on before us, wherein there was the leg of a beaver, and de&s;ired all the nations to come and eat of it; to eat in peace and plenty, and not to be churli&s;h to one another: And that if any &s;uch per&s;on &s;hould be &s;ound to be a di&s;turber, I here lay down by the edge of the di&s;h a rod, which you mu&s;t &s;courge them with; and if I your father, &s;hould get fooli&s;h in my old days, I de&s;ire you may u&s;e it upon me as well as others.</P>
<P>"Now, fathers, it is you who are the di&s;|turbers in this land, by coming and building your towns; and taking it away unknown to us, and by force.</P>
<P>"Fathers, we kindled a fire a long time ago, at a place called Montreal, where we de&s;ired you to &s;tay, and not to come and in|trude upon our land. I now de&s;ire you may di&s;patch to that place; for be it known to you, fathers, that this is our land, and not yours.</P>
<P>"Fathers, I de&s;ire you may hear me in civilne&s;s; it not, we mu&s;t handle that rod which was laid down for the u&s;e of the ob&s;tre|petons. If you had come in a peaceable manner, like our brothers the Engli&s;h, we
<PB N="17" REF="037222_0009_100C97C5986DDC48">&s;hould not have been again&s;t your trading with us, as they do: <HI>But to come, Fathers, and build houses upon our land, and to take it by force, is what we cannot submit to.</HI></P>
<P>"Fathers, both you and the Engli&s;h are white, we live in a country between; there|fore, the land belongs to neither one nor the other: But the great Being above allowed it to be a place of re&s;idence for us; &s;o fathers I de&s;ire you to withdraw, as I have done our brothers the Engli&s;h: For I will keep you at armslength. I lay this down as a trial for both, to &s;ee which will have the greate&s;t regard to it, and that &s;ide we will &s;tand by, and make equal &s;harers with us. Our brothers the En|gli&s;h have heard this, and I come now to tell it to you; for I am not afraid to di&s;charge you off this land."</P>
<P>This he &s;aid was the &s;ub&s;tance of what he &s;poke to the general, who made this reply.</P>
<P>"Now, my child, I have heard your &s;peech: You &s;poke fir&s;t, but its my time to &s;peak now. Where is my wampum that you took away, with the marks of towns in it? This wampum I do not know, which you have di&s;charged me off the land with: But you need not put your&s;elf to the trouble of &s;peaking, for I will not hear you. I am not afraid of flies, or mu&s;quitoes, for Indians
<PB N="18" REF="037222_0010_100C97C727D645D0">are &s;uch as tho&s;e. I tell you, down that river I will go, and build upon it, according to my command. If the river was blocked up, I have forces &s;ufficient to bur&s;t it open, and tread under my feet all that &s;tand in oppo&s;ition, together with their alliances; for my force is as the &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore: Therefore, here is vour wampum, I fling it at you. Child you talk fooli&s;h; you &s;ay this land belongs to you, but there is not the black of my nail yours. I &s;aw that land &s;ooner than you did, before the Shannoahs and you were at war: Lead was the man who went down and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that river: It is my land, and I will have it, let who will &s;tand up for or &s;ay again&s;t it. I'll buy and &s;ell with the Engli&s;h (mockingly.) If people will be ruled by me, they may expect kindne&s;s, but not el&s;e."</P>
<P>The hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> king told me he had enquired of the general after two Engli&s;hmen who were made pri&s;oners, and received this an&s;wer:&mdash; "Child, you think it a very great hard&s;hip that I made pri&s;oners of tho&s;e two people at Venango. Don't concern your&s;elf with it: We took and carried them to Canada, to get intelligence of what the Engli&s;h were doing in Virginia"</P>
<P>He informed me that they had built two
<PB N="19" REF="037222_0010_100C97C727D645D0">forts, one on Lake Erie, and another on French Creek, near a &s;mall lake about f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">teen miles a&s;under, and a large waggo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-road be|tween: They are both built after the &s;ame model, but different in &s;ize; that on the lake the large&s;t. He gave me a plan of them, of his own drawing.</P>
<P>The Indians enquired very particular after their brothers in Carolina jail.</P>
<P>They al&s;o a&s;ked what fort of a boy it was who was taken from the South Branch; for they were told by &s;ome Indians, that a party of French Indians had carried a white boy by Ku&s;ku&s;kas Town, towards the lakes.</P>
<P>November 26, 1753, we met in council, at the Long Hou&s;e, at about 9 o'clock, where I &s;pake to them as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Brothers, I have called you together in council, by order of your brother, the gover|nor of Virginia, to acquaint you, that I am &s;ent, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, to vi&s;it, and deliver a letter to the French commandant, of very great importance to your brothers the Engli&s;h; and I dare &s;ay to you, their friends and allies.</P>
<P>"I was de&s;ired, brothers, by your brother, the governor, to call upon you, the &s;achems of the nations, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">orm you of it, and to a&s;k your advice and a&s;&s;itance to proceed the near|e&s;t

<P>"His honour likewi&s;e de&s;ired me to apply to you for &s;ome of your young men, to con|duct and provide provi&s;ions for us on our way; and be a &s;afeguard again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>French Indi|ans</HI> who have taken up the hatchet again&s;t us. I have &s;poke this particularly to you, brothers, becau&s;e his honour, our governor, treats you as good friends and allies; and holds you in great e&s;teem. To confirm what I have &s;aid, I give this &s;tring of wampum."</P>
<P>After they had con&s;idered for &s;ome time on the above di&s;cour&s;e, the half-king got up and &s;poke:&mdash; "Now my brother, in regard to what my brother the governor had de&s;ired me, I re|turn you this an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"I rely upon you as a brother ought to do, as you &s;ay we are brothers and one people. We &s;hall put heart in hand, and &s;peak to our fathers the French concerning the &s;peech they made to me: and you may depend that we will endeavour to be your guard.</P>
<P>"Brother, as you have a&s;ked my advice, I hope you will be ruled by it, and &s;tay till I can provide a company to go with you. The <HI>French</HI> &s;peech belt is not here. I have it to
<PB N="21" REF="037222_0011_100C97C93B16E078">go for to my hunting cabbin: likewi&s;e the people whom I have ordered in are not yet come, nor cannot till the third night from this; till which time, brother, I mu&s;t beg you to &s;tay.</P>
<P>"I intend to &s;end the guard of <HI>Mingos, Shannoahs, and Delawares,</HI> that our brothers may &s;ee the love and loyalty we bear them."</P>
<P>As I had orders to make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch, and waiting here was very contrary to my inclination, I thanked him in the mo&s;t &s;uita|ble manner I could; and told him that my bu&s;ine&s;s required the greate&s;t expedition, and would not admit of delay. He was not well plea&s;ed that I &s;hould offer to go before the time he had appointed, and told me that he could not con&s;ent to our going without a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard, for fear &s;ome accident &s;hould befal us, and draw a reflection upon him. Be&s;ides, &s;ays he, this is a matter of no &s;mall moment, and mu&s;t not be entered into without due con|&s;ideration: for now I intend to deliver up the French &s;peech belt, and make the Shannoahs and Delawares do the &s;ame. And accordingly he gave orders to king Shingi&s;s, who was pre|&s;ent, to attend on Wedne&s;day night with the wampum, and two men of their nation, to be in rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s to &s;et out with us the next morn|ing. As I &s;ound It was impo&s;&s;ible to get off
<PB N="22" REF="037222_0012_100C97CACEFF5EE8">without affronting them in the mo&s;t egregious manner, I con&s;ented to &s;tay.</P>
<P>I gave them back a &s;tring of wampum, which I met with at Mr. Frazier's, and which they &s;ent with a &s;peech to his honour the governor, to inform him, that three na|tions of French Indians, viz Chippoways, Ottoways, and Orundaks; had taken up the hatchet again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and de&s;ired them to repeat it over again: but this they po&s;t|poned doing till they met in full council with the Shannoah and Delaware chiefs.</P>
<P>27th. Runners were di&s;patched very early for the Shannoah chiefs. The half-king &s;et out him&s;elf to fetch the French &s;peech belt from his hunting cabbin.</P>
<P>28th. He returned this evening, and came with Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">katoocha, and two other &s;achems, to my tent; and begged (as they had com|plied with his honor the governor's reque&s;t, in providing men, &amp;c.) to know on what bu|&s;ine&s;s we were going to the French? This was a que&s;tion I all along expected, and had pro|vided as &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to, as I could, which allayed their curio&s;ity a little.</P>
<P>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">katoocha informed me, that an In|dian from Venango brought news, a few days ago, that the French had called all the Min|gos, Delawares, &amp;c. together at that place;
<PB N="23" REF="037222_0012_100C97CACEFF5EE8">and told them that they intended to have been down the river this fall, but the waters were growing cold, and the winter advancing, which obliged them to go into quarters; but that they might a&s;&s;uredly expect them in the &s;pring, with a far greater number; and de|&s;ired that they might be quite pa&s;&s;ive, and not to intermeddle, unle&s;s they had a mind to draw all their force upon them: for that they expected to &s;ight the Engli&s;h three years (as they &s;uppo&s;ed there would be &s;ome attempts made to &s;top them) in which time they &s;hould conquer: but that if they &s;hould prove equally &s;trong, they and the Engli&s;h, would join to cut them all off, and divide the land between them: that though they had lo&s;t their general, and &s;ome &s;ew of their &s;oldiers, yet there were men enough to reinforce them, and make them ma&s;ters of the Ohio.</P>
<P>This &s;peech, he &s;aid, was delivered to them by one captain Joncaire, their interpreter in chief, living at Venango, and a man of note in the army.</P>
<P>29th. The half king and Monokatoocha came very early and begged me to &s;tay one day more; for netwith&s;tanding they had u&s;ed all the diligence in their power, the Shannoah chiefs had not brought the wampum they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red, but would certainly be in this night; if
<PB N="24" REF="037222_0013_100C97CEAC7F6B20">not, they would delay me no longer, but would &s;end it after us as &s;oon as they arrived. When I found them &s;o pre&s;&s;ing in their re|que&s;t, and knew that the returning of wam|pum was the aboli&s;hing of agreements, and giving this up, was &s;haking off all dependence upon the French. I con&s;ented to &s;tay, as I believed an offence offered at this cri&s;is, might be attended with greater ill con&s;equence than another day's delay. They al&s;o informed me that Shingi&s;s could not get in his men; and was prevented from coming him&s;elf by his wife's &s;ickne&s;s, (I believe, by fear of the French) but that the wampum of that nation was lodged with Ku&s;taloga one of their chiefs at Venango.</P>
<P>In the evening, late, they came again and acquainted me that the Shannoahs were not yet arrived, but that it &s;hould not retard the pro&s;ecution of our journey. He delivered in my hearing, the &s;peeches that were to be made to the French by Je&s;kakake, one of their old chiefs which was giving up the belt the late commandant had a&s;ked for, and repeating near the &s;ame &s;peech he him&s;elf had done before.</P>
<P>He al&s;o delivered a &s;tring of wampum to this chief who was &s;ent by king Shingi&s;s, to
<PB N="25" REF="037222_0013_100C97CEAC7F6B20">be given to Ku&s;taloga, with orders to repair to the French, and deliver up the wampum.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e gave a very large &s;tring of black and white wampum which was to be &s;ent up immediately to the &s;ix nations, if the French refu&s;ed to qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the land at this warn|ing; which was the third and la&s;t time, and was the right of this Je&s;kakake to deliver.</P>
<P>30th. La&s;t night the great men a&s;&s;embled at their council hou&s;e, to con&s;ult further about this jonrney, and who were to go: the re|&s;ult of which was, that only three of their chiefs, with one of their be&s;t hunters, &s;hould be our convoy. The rea&s;on they gave for not &s;ending more, after what had been pro|po&s;ed at council the 26th, was, that a great|er number might give the French &s;u&s;picions of &s;ome bad de&s;ign, and cau&s;e them to be treated rudely: but I rather think they could not get their hunters in.</P>
<P>We &s;et out about 9 o'clock with the half king, Je&s;kakake, White Thunder, and the Hunter; and travelled on the road to the Venango, where we arrived the 4th of De|cember, without any thing remarkable hap|pening, but a continued &s;eries of bad wea|ther.</P>
<P>This is an old Indian town, &s;ituated at the mouth of French Creek on Ohio; and
<PB N="26" REF="037222_0014_100C97D09058D080">lies near N. about &s;ixty miles from the Loggs town, but more than &s;eventy the way we were obliged to go.</P>
<P>We found the French colours hoi&s;ted at a hou&s;e from which they had driven Mr. John Frazier, an Engli&s;h &s;ubject. I imme|diately repaired to it, to know where the commander re&s;ided. There were three of|ficers, one of whom, captain Joncaire, in|formed me, that he had the command of the Ohio: but that there was a general of|ficer at the near fort, where he advi&s;ed me to apply for an an&s;wer. He invited us to &s;up with them; and treated us with the great|e&s;t complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>The wine, as they dozed them&s;elves pret|ty plentifully with it, &s;oon bani&s;hed the re|&s;traint which at fir&s;t appeared in their con|ver&s;ation; and gave a licen&s;e to their tongues to reveal their &s;entiments more freely.</P>
<P>They told me, that it was their ab&s;olute de&s;ign to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ohio, and by G&mdash;d they would do it: for that although they were &s;en&s;ible the Engli&s;h could rai&s;e two men for their one; yet they knew, their motions were too &s;low and dilatory to prevent any undertaking of theirs. They pretend to have an undoubted right to the river from a di&s;covery made by one La Solle
<PB N="27" REF="037222_0014_100C97D09058D080">&s;ixty years ago; and the ri&s;e of this expedi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion is, to prevent our &s;ettling on the river or waters of it, as they had heard of &s;ome fa|milies moving out in order thereto. From the be&s;t intelligence I could<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">get, there have been 1500 men on this &s;ido Ontario Lake; but upon the death of the general, all were recalled to about &s;ix or &s;even hundred, who were left to garri&s;on four forts, one hundred and fifty or thereabouts in each. The tir&s;t of them is on French Creek, near a &s;mall Lake, about &s;ixty miles from Venango, near N. N. W. The next lies on Lake Erie, where the greater part of their &s;tores are kept, about fifteen miles from the other. From this it is one hundred and twenty miles to the carrying place, at the falls of Lake Erie, where there is a &s;mall fort; which they lodge their goods at, in bringing them from Montreal, the place whence all their &s;tores come from. The next fort lies about twenty miles from this, on Ontario Lake. Between this fort and Montreal there are three others, the fir&s;t of which is nearly op|po&s;ite to the Engli&s;h fort O&s;wego. From the fort on Lake Erie to Montreal is about &s;ix hundred miles, which they &s;ay requires no more, if good weather, than four week's voyage, if they go in barks or large ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="28" REF="037222_0015_100C97D2A6A036D0">&s;o that they may cro&s;s the lake: but if they come in can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es it will require five or &s;ix weeks, for they are obliged to keep under the &s;hore.</P>
<P>5th. Rained exce&s;&s;ively all day, which prevented our travelling. Captain Joncaire &s;ent for the half king, as he had but ju&s;t heard that he came with me: he affected to be much concerned that I did not make free to bring them in before. I excu&s;ed it in the be&s;t manner I was capable, and told him, I did not think their company agreeable, as I had heard him &s;ay a good deal in di&s;prai&s;e of Indians in general. But another motive prevented me from bringing them into his company: I knew he was interpreter, and a per&s;on of very great influence among the Indians, and had lately u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to draw them over to their intere&s;t; there|fore I was de&s;irous of giving no opportunity that could be avoided.</P>
<P>When they came in, there was great plea|&s;ure expre&s;&s;ed at &s;eeing them. He wonder|ed how they could be &s;o near without com|ing to vi&s;it him; made &s;everal tri&s;ing pre|&s;ents; and applied liqour &s;o fa&s;t, that they were &s;oon rendered incapable of the bu&s;ine&s;s they came about, notwith&s;tanding the cau|tion which was given.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037222_0015_100C97D2A6A036D0">
6th. The half king came to my tent, quite &s;ober, and in&s;i&s;ted very much that I &s;hould &s;tay and hear what he had to &s;ay to the French. I fain would have prevented his &s;peaking any thing, till he came to the com|mandant; but could not prevail. He told me, that at this place a council fire was kin|dled, where all their bu&s;ine&s;s with tho&s;e peo|ple was to be tran&s;acted: and that the ma|nagement of the Indian affairs was left &s;ole|ly to mon&s;ieur Joncaire. As I was de&s;irous of knowing the i&s;&s;ue of this, I agreed to &s;tay: but &s;ent our hor&s;es a little ways up French Greck, to ra&s;t over and encamp; which I knew would make it near night.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock they met in council. The king &s;poke much the &s;ame as he had be|fore done to the general; and offered the French &s;peech belt which had before been demanded with the marks of four towns on it, which mon&s;ieur Joncaire refu&s;ed to re|ceive; but de&s;ired him to carry it to the fort to the commander.</P>
<P>7th. Mon&s;ieur La Force, commi&s;&s;ary of the French &s;tores, and three other &s;oldiers, came over to accompany us up. We &s;ound it extremely difficult to get the Indians off to-day, as every &s;tratagem had been u&s;ed to prevent their going up with me. I had la&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="037222_0016_100C97D4E288AED8">night left John Davi&s;on (the Indian interpre|ter) whom I had brought with me from town, and &s;trictly charged him not to be out of their company, as I could not get them over to my tent: for they had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with Ku&s;ta|loga, chiefly to know the rea&s;on why he did not deliver up the French belt which he had in keeping: but I was obliged to &s;end Mr. Gi&s;t over to-day to fetch them; which he did with great per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock we &s;et out for the fort, and were prevented from arriving there till the 11th, by exce&s;&s;ive rains, &s;nows, and bad travelling, through many mires and &s;wamps. The&s;e we were obliged to pa&s;s, to avoid cro&s;&s;ing the creek, which was impo&s;&s;ible ei|ther by fording or rafting, the water was &s;o high and rapid.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed over much good land &s;ince we left Venango, and through &s;everal exten&s;ive and very rich meadows; one of which, I be|lieve, was near four miles in length, and con|&s;iderably wide in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>12th. I prepared early to wait upon the commander, and was received and conducted to him by the &s;econd o&s;&s;icer in command. I acquainted him with my bu&s;ine&s;s, and o&s;&s;er|ed my commi&s;&s;ion and letter: both of which he de&s;ired me to keep till the arrival of mon|&s;ieur
<PB N="31" REF="037222_0016_100C97D4E288AED8">Raparti, captain, at the next fort, who was &s;ent for, and expected every hour.</P>
<P>This commander is a knight of the milita|ry order of St. Lewis, and named Legardeur de St. Piere. He is an elderly gentleman, and has much the air of a &s;oldier. He was &s;ent over to take the command, immediately upon the death of the late general, and ar|rived here but about &s;even days before me.</P>
<P>At two o'clock the gentleman who was &s;ent for arrived, when I offered the letter, &amp;c. again; which they received, adjourned into a private apartment for the captain to tran&s;late, who under&s;tood a little Engli&s;h. After he had done it, the commander de&s;ir|ed I would walk in, and bring my interpreter to peru&s;e and correct it; which I did.</P>
<P>13th. The chief o&s;&s;icers retired, to hold a council of war; which gave me an opportu|nity of taking the dimen&s;ions of the fort, and making what ob&s;ervations I could.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on the &s;outh, or we&s;t fork of French creek, near the water; and is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the creek, and a &s;mall branch of it which forms a kind of i&s;land. Four hou&s;es compo&s;e the &s;ides. The ba&s;tions are made of piles driven into the ground, &s;tand|ing more than twelve feet above it, and &s;harp at the top; with port holes cut for
<PB N="32" REF="037222_0017_100C97D709990BE8">cannon and loop holes for the &s;mall arms to mounted in each ba&s;tion; and one piece of four pounds before the gate. In the ba&s;tions are a guard hou&s;e, chapel, doctor's lodging, and the commander's private &s;tore; round which are laid platforms for the cannon and men to &s;tand on. There are &s;everal barracks without the fort for the &s;oldiers' dwelling; covered, &s;ome with bark, and &s;ome with boards, made chiefly of logs. There are al&s;o &s;everal other hou&s;es, &s;uch as &s;tables, &s;mith's &s;hop, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I could get no certain account of the number of men here; but according to the be judgment I could form, there are an hundred exclu&s;ive of o&s;&s;icers, of which there are many. I al&s;o gave orders to the people who were with me, to take an exact ac|count of the canoes which were hauled up to convey their &s;orces down in the &s;pring. This they did, and told fifty of birch bark, and one hundred and &s;eventy of pine; be&s;ides many others which were blocked out, in readine&s;s to make.</P>
<P>14th. As the &s;now increa&s;ed very fa&s;t, and our hor&s;es daily became weaker, I &s;ent them off unloaded; under the care of Barna|by Currin, and two others, to make all con|venient
<PB N="33" REF="037222_0017_100C97D709990BE8">di&s;patch to Venango, and there wait our arrival, if there was a pro&s;pect of the river's freezing; if not, then to continue down to Shannapin's town, at the forks of the Ohio, and there to wait till we came to cro&s;s Aligany; intending my&s;elf to go down by water, as I had the offer of a canoe or two.</P>
<P>As I found many plots concerted to retard the Indians' bu&s;inefs, and prevent their re|turning with me; I endeavoured all that lay in my power to fru&s;trate their &s;chemes and hurry them on to execute their intended de|&s;ign. They accordingly pre&s;&s;ed for admit|tance this evening, which at length was granted them, privately, with the command|er and one or two other officers. The half king told me, that he offered the wampum to the commander, who evaded taking it, and made many fair promi&s;es of love and friend&s;hip; &s;aid he wanted to live in peace, and trade amicably with them, as a proof of which he would &s;end &s;ome goods immediate|ly down to the Loggs town for them. But I rather think the de&s;ign of that is, to bring away all our &s;traggling traders they meet with, as I privately under&s;tood they intend|ed to carry an officer, &amp;c. with them. And what rather confirms this opinion, I was en|quiring of the commander, by what autho|rity
<PB N="34" REF="037222_0018_100C97D8F1C8FEC0">he had made pri&s;oners of &s;everal of cur Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. He told me that the coun|try belonging to them; no Engli&s;hman had a right to trade upon tho&s;e waters; and that he had orders to make every one pri|&s;oner who attempted it on the Ohio, or the waters of it.</P>
<P>I enquired of captain Riparti about the boy who was carried by this place, as it was done while the command devolved on him between the death of the late general, and the arrival of the pre&s;ent. He acknowledged that a boy had been carried pa&s;t; and that the Indians had two or three white men's &s;calps, (I was told by &s;ome of the Indians at Venango eight) but pretended to have forgot|ten the name of the place which the boy came from, and all the particularfacts, though he had que&s;tioned him for &s;ome hours, as they were carrying him pa&s;t. I likewi&s;e enquired what they had done with John Trotter and James Mac Clocklin, two Penn&s;ylvania traders, whom they had taken, with all their goods. They told me, that they had been &s;ent to Canada, but were now returned home.</P>
<P>This evening I received an an&s;wer to his honour the governor's letter from the com|mandant.</P>

15th. The commandant ordered a plenti|ful &s;tore of liquor, provi&s;ion, &amp;c. to be put on board our canoe; and appeared to be ex|tremely complai&s;ant, though he was exerting every artifice which he could invent to &s;et our own Indians at varience with us, to prevent their going until alter our departure.

<P>16th.

<P>Our hor&s;es were now &s;o weak and feeble, and the baggage &s;o heavy (as we were obliged to provide all the nece&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies which the journey would require) that we doubted much their performing it: Therefore my&s;elf and others (except the drivers who were obliged to ride) gave up our hor&s;es for packs, to a&s;&s;i&s;t along with the bag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age. I put my&s;elf in an Indian walking dre&s;s, and continued with
<PB N="38" REF="037222_0020_100C97DDF7A22830">them three days, till I found there was no probability of their getting home in any rea|&s;onable &s;onable time. The hor&s;es grew le&s;s able to travel every day; the cold increa&s;ed very fa&s;t; and the roads were becoming much wor&s;t by a deep &s;now, continually freezing: There|fore, as I was unea&s;y to get back, to make report of my proceedings to his Honor the Governor, I determined to pro&s;ecute m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> journey the neare&s;t way through the woods on foot.</P>
<P>Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of our baggage; with money and direction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to provide nece&s;&s;aries from place to place fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves and hor&s;es, and to make the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> convenient di&s;patch in travelling.</P>
<P>I took my nece&s;&s;ary papers; pulled off m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cloaths; and tied my&s;elf up in a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d coat.

We took this fellow into cu&s;tody, and kept him until about 9 o'clock at night: Then let him go, and walked all the remain|ing part of the night without making any &s;top; that we might get the &s;tart, &s;o far, as to be out of the reach of their pur&s;uit next day, &s;ince we were well a&s;&s;ured they would &s;ollow our track as &s;oon as it was light. The next day we continued travelling till quite dark, and got to the river about two miles above Shannapins. We expected to have found the river frozen, but it was not, only about 50 yards from each &s;hore: The ice I &s;up|po&s;e had broken up above, for it was dri|ving in va&s;t quantities.</P>
<P>There was no way for getting over but on a ra&s;t: which we &s;et about, but with one poor hatcher, and fini&s;hed ju&s;t after &s;un &s;etting. This was a whole days work: We next got it launched, and went on board of it: Then &s;et off. But before we were half way over, we were jammed in the ice, in &s;uch a manner that we expected every mo|ment our raft to &s;ink, and our&s;elves to peri&s;h. I put out my &s;etting pole to &s;top the ra&s;t, that the ice might pa&s;s by; when the rapidity of the &s;tream threw it with &s;o much violenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t the pole, that it jirked me out into ten feet water: But I fortunately &s;aved my&s;elf by catching hold of one of the raft logs. Not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="40" REF="037222_0021_100C97DFB9A23238">with&s;tanding all our efforts, we could not get to either &s;hore; but were obliged, as we were near an i&s;l nd, to quit out raft and make to it.</P>
<P>The cold was &s;o extremely &s;evere, that Mr. Gi&s;t had all his fingers, and &s;ome of his toes frozen; and the water was &s;hut up &s;o hard, that we found no difficulty in getting off the i&s;land, on the ice, in the morning; and went to Mr. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">azier's. We met here with twenty warriors who were going to the &s;outhward to war: But coming to a place upon the head of the great Kunnaway, where they found &s;even people killed and &s;calped (all but one woman with very light hair) they turned a|bout and ran back for fear the inhabitants &s;hould ri&s;e and take them as the authors of the murder. They report that the bodies were lying about the hou&s;e, and &s;ome of them much torn and eaten by hogs: By the marks which were left, they &s;ay they were French Indians of the Ottoway nation, &amp;c. who did it.</P>
<P>As we intended to take hor&s;es here, and it required &s;ome time to find them, I went up about three miles to the mouth of the Yaugh|yaugh gane to vi&s;it Queen Alliquippa, who had expreded great co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rn that we pa&s;&s;ed her in going to the &s;ort.

<P>Tue&s;day the I&s;t day of January, we left Mr. Frazier's hou&s;e, and arrived at Mr. Gi&s;t's at Monongahela the 2d, where I bought a hor&s;e, &s;addle, &amp;c. The 6th we met 17 hor&s;es loaded with materials and &s;tores for a fort at the forks of Ohio, and the day after &s;ome familtes going out to &s;ettle: This day we arrived at Wills Creck, after as fatiguing a journey as it is po&s;&s;ible to conceive, render|ed &s;o by exce&s;&s;ive bad weather. From the fir&s;t day of December to the 15th, there was but one day in which it did not rain or &s;now in|ce&s;&s;antly; and throughout the whole journey we met with nothing but one continued &s;e|ries of cold wet weather, which occa&s;ioned very uncomfortable lodgings; e&s;pecially after we had quitted our tent, which was &s;ome &s;creen from the inclemency of it.</P>
<P>On the 11th I got to Belvoir; where I &s;top|ped one day to take nece&s;&s;ary re&s;t; and then &s;et out, and arrived in William&s;burg the 16th; when I waited on his honour the governor with the letter I had brought from the French commandant; and to give an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of my proceedings.

<P>On his return from this perilous emba&s;&s;y, with mon&s;ieur de St. Piere's an&s;wer, and his good &s;ucce&s;s in the Indian negociations Maj. Wa&s;hington was complimented with the thanks and approbation of his country. His Journal does great credit to his indu&s;try, at|tention, and judgment; and it has &s;ince prov|ed of infinite &s;ervice to tho&s;e who have been doomed to traver&s;e the &s;ame inho&s;pitable tracts.</P>
<P>Governor Dinwiddie's letter to the French commandant and M. de St. Piere's an&s;wer were both publi&s;hed in the new&s;papers in London. The French commandants an&s;wer, only &s;tated that he was on French ground,
<PB N="43" REF="037222_0022_100C97E20FD15100">and by the order of his general to whom he was going to di&s;patch the governor's letter.</P>
<P>In 1754, the de&s;igns of the French be|coming more manife&s;t, and their movements more daring, orders were i&s;&s;ued by admi|ni&s;tration for the colonies to arm and unite in one confederacy. The a&s;&s;embly of Virgi|nia took the lead, by voting a &s;um of money for the public &s;ervice, and rai&s;ing a regiment for the protection of the frontiers of the co|lony. Of this corps, Mr. Fry, one of the profe&s;&s;ors of the college was appointed Co|lonel, and Major Wa&s;hington received the commi&s;&s;ion of Lieutenant Colonel. Hut Co|lonel Fry died without ever having joined; and of cour&s;e le&s;t his regiment to the &s;econd in command. Colonel Wa&s;hington began his march on the 2d. of April, from Alexan|dria, having under his command one hundred and fifty men. His orders were to march towards the Ohio, there to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">t captain Trent to build &s;orts, and defend the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his maje&s;ty again&s;t the attempts and ho&s;tili|ties of the French. During his march he was joined by a &s;mall detachment under com|mand of captain Stephens, and when he had proceeded as far as Wills-Creck, he receiv|ed intelligence that captain Trent had been obliged to &s;urrender the fort which he had
<PB N="44" REF="037222_0023_100C97E5A1A910C0">erected between the Ohio and French creek, to a body of about eight hundred French, commanded by captain Contrecoeur; where|upon, Colonel Wa&s;hington deeming it im|practicable to march towards the fort without Fu&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ient force, thought it mo&s;t prudent to proceed to open roads &s;o as to pre-occupy the advantageous po&s;t at the con&s;luence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which in his preceding Journal he recommends for 01 that purpo&s;e. He was to have been joined by a detachment of independent regulars from the &s;outhern colonies, together with &s;ome companies of Provincials from North Carolina and Maryland. But perceiving the nece&s;&s;ity of expedition, and without waiting for their arrival, he commenced his march before they arrived; but, notwith&s;tanding his precipitated advance, the French had al|ready taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and erected a fortifica|tion, which they named fort <HI>Du Quesne,</HI> in honour of the marquis du Que&s;ne, the French governor of Canada.</P>
<P>Colonel Wa&s;hington accordingly proceeded on his march from Wills-Creek; bravely encountering all the ob&s;lecles and difficulties of an impervious wilderne&s;s, cro&s;&s;ing mires, &s;avannas and rivers. His men were &s;ome time, forced to ford rivers &s;o deep as to
<PB N="45" REF="037222_0023_100C97E5A1A910C0">take them up to the arm-pits; when he had proceeded as far as Turkyfoot, he received inforination that a party of French com|manded by M. de Jumonville, were conceal|ed within a &s;hort di&s;tance of his camp; where|upon, he &s;ecured his waggons and put him|&s;elf in the be&s;t means of defence he was ca|pable of, until he had learned the &s;trength of the enemy, and the place where they were.</P>
<P>Having received from the Indians the ne|ce&s;&s;ary information, on the night of the 27th May, he &s;et out with his men (except about forty, which was left to guard his ammu|nition, &amp;c.) and a party of Indians, which the half king &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, under a heavy rain, and a night dark as pitch, they travelled along a path &s;carcely broad enough for one man; they were &s;ometimes fifteen or twenty minutes out of the path before they could come to it again, and &s;o dark, that they would often &s;trike one again&s;t another; all night they continued their ront, and in the morning about &s;un-ri&s;e, formed them&s;elves for an engagement, marching one after ano|ther in the Indian manner, the enemy did not di&s;cover them until they were clo&s;e up|on them, when Colonel Wa&s;hington's com|pany &s;ired, and was &s;upported by Mr. Wa|ger's;
<PB N="46" REF="037222_0024_100C97E730100038">the&s;e two companies received the whole &s;ire of the French, which la&s;ted a quar|ter of an hour before the enemy was routed out. M. de Jumonville and nine others were killed, one wounded, and twenty one made pri&s;oners. Among the pri&s;oners was the celebrated woodsman, mon&s;ieur de la Force, commi&s;&s;ary of the French &s;tores, and two o|ther officers. Only one of the whole party e&s;caped. A Canadian, named Monceau, who&s;e report of the action was &s;uch, as to impre&s;s upon the minds of the French, a belief that Colonel Wa&s;hington's conduct was highly treacherous and di&s;honourable. The French account of this engagement is contained in a letter from M. de Contrecoeur to the mar|quis du Que&s;ne, dated Fort du Que&s;ne, May 23d. 1754. It &s;tates that M. de Jumonville &s;et out with a &s;mall e&s;cort, charged with a written &s;ummons, in form of a letter, direct|ed to the fir&s;t Engli&s;h officer he &s;hould meet on the lands claimed by the French king, &s;um|moning him to withdraw his troops in peace from &s;aid territory, otherwi&s;e that they would repel force to force, de&s;iring the Engli&s;h of|ficer to return his an&s;wer by M. de Jumon|ville and to treat that officer with that di&s;|tinction and re&s;pect which he de&s;erved, that the deputy &s;et out, and next morning found
<PB N="47" REF="037222_0024_100C97E730100038">him&s;elf &s;urrounded by a number of Engli&s;h and Indians, that the Engli&s;h quicky fired two vollies, which killed &s;ome &s;oldiers, that M. Jumonville made a &s;ign that he had a letter from his commander, whereupon the fire cea&s;ed, and the Engli&s;h &s;urrounded the French officer, in order to hear it, that as he was reading the &s;ummons a &s;econd time, he was killed by a mu&s;ket &s;hot in the head, and, that, had it not been for the Indians, who ru&s;hed in between the French and the Engli&s;h, the former would have been all a&s;ladinated; that the Indians did not fire upon the French. This report was made the mo&s;t of by the French, who impre&s;&s;ed it upon the minds of the &s;urrounding Indians, as a mo&s;t &s;hocking and ba&s;e murder, perpetrated by the expre&s;s command of Colonel Wa&s;hington. But the following extract from Colonel Wa&s;hington's Journal, of his proceedings given in to Gov|ernor Dinwiddie, places it in a quite differ|ent point of view, he &s;tates, via, "We were advanced pretty near to them as we thought, when they di&s;covered us; where|upon, I ordered my company to fire, mine was &s;upported by Mr. Wager's, and my company and his, received the whole fire or the French, during the greate&s;t part of the
<PB N="48" REF="037222_0025_100C97E8D03AE458">action, which only la&s;ted a quarter of an hour, before the enemy was routed.</P>
<P>"We killed Mr. de Jumonville, the com|mander of that Party, as al&s;o nine others; we wounded one, and made twenty-one pri|&s;oners, among whom were M. la Force, M. Drouillon, and two Cadets. The Indians &s;calped the dead, and took away mo&s;t part of their arms, after which we marched on with the pri&s;oners and the guard, to the Indian camp, where again I held a council with the Half-King; and there informed him that, the governor was de&s;irous to &s;ee him, and was waiting for him at Winche&s;ter; he an&s;wered, that, he could not go ju&s;t then, as his people were in too eminent a danger from the French, whom they had fallen upon; that he mu&s;t &s;end me&s;&s;enges to all the allied nations, in order to invite them to take up the Hatchet. He &s;ent a young Delaware Indian to the Delaware Nation, and gave him al&s;o a French Scalp to carry to them. This young man de&s;ired to have a part of the pre&s;ents which were allotted for them, but that the remain|ing part might be kept for another opportu|nity: He &s;aid he would go to his own family, and to &s;everal others, and would wait on them at Mr. Gi&s;t's, where he de&s;ired men and hor&s;es &s;hould be &s;ent ready to bring them up to our
<PB N="49" REF="037222_0025_100C97E8D03AE458">camp. After this I marched on with the pri|&s;oners; They informed me that they had been font with a &s;ummons to order me to de|part. A plau&s;ible pretence to di&s;cover our camp, and to obtain the knowledge of our forces and our &s;ituation! It was &s;o clear that they were come to reconnoitre what we were, that I admired at their a&s;&s;urance, when they told me they were come as an Emba&s;&s;y; for their in&s;tructions mentioned that they &s;hould get what knowledge they could of the roads, rivers, and of all the country as far as Potowmack: And in&s;tead of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ng as an Emba&s;&s;ador, publicly, and in an open man|ner, they came &s;ecretly, and &s;ought after the mo&s;t hidden retreats, more like de&s;erters than emba&s;&s;adors; in &s;uch retreats they encamped, and remained hid whole days together, and that, no more than five miles from us: from thence they &s;ent &s;pies to reconnoitre our camp; after this was done, they went back two miles, from whence the &s;ent the two me&s;&s;engers &s;po|ken of in the in&s;truction, to acquaint M. de Contrecoeur of the place we were at, and of our di&s;po&s;ition, that he might &s;end his detatch|ments to inforce the &s;ummons, as &s;oon as i &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, an emba&s;lador has princely at|tendants; whereas this was only a &s;imple
<PB N="50" REF="037222_0026_100C97EB686C30B8">petty French officer; an emba&s;&s;ador has no need of &s;pies, his character being always &s;a|cred: And &s;eeing their intention was &s;o good, why did they tarry two days, at five miles di&s;tance from us, without acquainting me with the &s;ummons, or, at lea&s;t, with &s;ome, thing that related to the emba&s;ly? That a|lone would be &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the greate&s;t &s;u&s;picions, we ought to do them the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that, as they wanted to hide them|&s;elves, they could not pick out better places than they had done.</P>
<P>"The &s;ummons was &s;o in&s;olent, and &s;a|voured the ga&s;conade &s;o much, that if it had been brought openly by two men, it would have been an immediate indulgence, to have &s;uffered them to return.</P>
<P>"It was the opinien of the half king in this ca&s;e, that their intentions were evil, and that it was a pure pretence; that they never intended to come tous but as onenies; and if we had been &s;uch fools as to let them go, they would never help us any more to take other Frenchmen.</P>
<P>"They &s;ay they called to us as &s;oon as they had di&s;covered us, which is an ab&s;o|lute fal&s;ehood, for, I was then marching at the head of the company going towards them, and can po&s;itively affirm, that, when they
<PB N="51" REF="037222_0026_100C97EB686C30B8">fir&s;t &s;aw us, they ran to their arms, without calling; as I mu&s;t have heard them, had they &s;o done."</P>
<P>From the French pri&s;oners, Colonel Wa&s;h|ington had intelligence, that the French forces on the Ohio con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of one thou&s;and regulars, and &s;ome hundreds of Indians. Upon this intelligence, and con&s;i|dering his little army which was &s;omewhat reduced, and entirely in&s;ufficient to act offen|&s;ive again&s;t the French and Indians, he fell back to a place known by the appellation of the <HI>Great Meadows,</HI> for the &s;ake of forage and &s;upplies. Here he built a temporary &s;tockade, merely to cover his &s;tores; it was from its fate called <HI>Fort Necessity.</HI> Colonel Wa&s;hington was too &s;endi le of the advan|tages of Fort du Que&s;ne, to abandon the idea of taking it. Ever &s;ince he le&s;t Wills-creek, he had been indefatigable in his exertions to form the regiment, open roads, and gain the Indians over to the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, as al&s;o to watch the operations of the French, and gain a knowledge of their &s;orts, &s;ituation, and forces, even as far as the lakes. He had wrote to the Governors of Penn&s;ylvania and Maryland, reque&s;ting their aid in the augmentation of his army. He remained at Fort Nece&s;&s;ity for the arrival of &s;ome expect|ed
<PB N="52" REF="037222_0027_100C97EDD07568D0">&s;uccour from New York and Pena&s;ylvania, and remained un mole&s;ted, until the July &s;ol|lowing, when his &s;mall &s;orce, even after it was joined by captain M'Kay's regulars did not amount to four hundred effectives, was attacked by an army of French and Indians, computed to have been &s;ixteen hundred &s;trong, under the command of the Sieur de Villiers, the brother of M. de Jumonville. The chief intention of this campaign, the French officer acknowledged, was to revenge the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his brother, and to hinder any e&s;tabli&s;hments on the lands claimed by the king of France.</P>
<P>The Virginians &s;u&s;tained the attack of the enemy's whole force for &s;everal hours, and laid near two hundred of them dead in the field, when the French commander, di&s;cou|raged by &s;uch determined re&s;olution, propo&s;|ed the le&s;s dangerous method of di&s;lodging his enemy by a parly, which ended in a ca|pitulation. It was &s;tipulated, that Colonel Wa&s;hington &s;hould march away with all the honours of war, and be allewed to carry off all his military &s;tores, e&s;&s;ects and baggage. This capitulation was violated from the un|governable di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians, whom the French commander could not re&s;train from plundering the provinclas on the out&s;et
<PB N="53" REF="037222_0027_100C97EDD07568D0">of their march, and from making a con&s;ider|able &s;laughter of men, cattle and hor&s;es. Af|ter this di&s;a&s;ter the remains of the Virginia regiment returned to Alexandria to be recruit|edand furni&s;h with nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies: During this period, the French redoubled their activity and deligence on the Ohio, and in other places, and Virginia who determined to &s;end out a larger force, in the &s;pring follow|ing, erected the forts Cumberland and Lon|don, and formed a camp at Wills-creek, in order to annoy the enemy on the Ohio. In the&s;e &s;everal &s;ervices (particularly in the con&s;truction of forts) Colonel Wa&s;hington was principally employed.</P>
<P>In 1755, the Briti&s;h government &s;ent to this county, General braddock, who was appointed to the command of all the troops and forces which were, or that &s;hould be rai&s;ed in, or &s;ent to, North America; he land|ed at William&s;burg, Virginia, in February, with two veteran regiments from Ireland, but &s;ent his men up the Potomack to Alex|andria, there to encamp until he was joined with the independent and provincial corps of America; with this army he was to pene|trate through the country to fort Da Que&s;ne (now fort Pitt) by the rout of Wills-creek to repel the French from the confines of the
<PB N="54" REF="037222_0028_100C97F079E00658">Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, and as no per&s;on was was better acquainted with the frontier country than Coloned Wa&s;hington, and no one in the colony enjoyed &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed a military character, he was judged to be highly &s;erviceable to General Braddock, but from a royal arrangement of rank, by which "no officer who did not immediately derive his commi&s;&s;ion from the king, could command one who did." Colonel Wa&s;hington cheerful|ly relinqui&s;hed his regiment and went as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> extra aid de camp into the family of Gene|ral Braddock. In this capacity, at the battle of the Monongahela, on the oth of July, 1755, he attended that General, who&s;e life was gal|lantly &s;acraficed in attempting to extricate his troops from the fatal ambu&s;cade into which him over-weaning confidence had conducted them. Braddock had &s;everal hor&s;es &s;hot under him, before he feli him&s;elf; and there was not as officer, who&s;e duty obliged him to be on hor&s;e-back that day, excepting Colonel Wa&s;h|ington, who was not either killed or wound|ed. This circum&s;tance enabled him to di&s;play greater abilities in covering the retreat and &s;aving the wreck of the army, than he could otherwi&s;e have done. As &s;oon as he had &s;e|cured their pa&s;&s;age over the ford of the Mo|nongahela, and found they were not pur&s;ued
<PB N="55" REF="037222_0028_100C97F079E00658">he ha&s;ted to concert mea&s;ures for their further &s;ecurity with Colonel Dunbar, who had re|mained with the &s;econd divi&s;ion and heavy baggage at &s;ome di&s;tance in the rear. To effect this he travelled with two guides, all night, through an almo&s;t impervious wilder|ne&s;s, not with&s;tanding the fatigues he had un|dergone in the day, and although he had &s;o imperfectly recovered from &s;ickne&s;s, that he was obliged in the morning to be &s;upported with cu&s;hions on his hor&s;e. The public ac|counts in Britain and America were not par|&s;imonious of applau&s;e for the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice he had rendered on &s;o trying an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not long after this time, the regulation of rank, which had been &s;o injurious to the colo|nial officers, was changed to their &s;atisfaction, in con&s;equence of the di&s;content of the offi|cers, and the remon&s;trance of Colonel Wa&s;h|ington; and the &s;upreme power of Virginia, impre&s;&s;ed with a due &s;en&s;e of his merits, gave him, in a new and extenfive commi&s;&s;ion, the command of all the troops rai&s;ed and to be rai&s;ed in that colony.</P>
<P>It would not comport with the intended brevity of this &s;ketch, to mention in detail the plans he &s;ugge&s;ted or the &s;y&s;tem he pur&s;ued for de&s;ending the frontiers, until the year 1758, when he commanded the van brigade
<PB N="56" REF="037222_0029_100C97F25A583B70">of General Forbe's army in the capture of Fort Du Que&s;ne. A &s;imilar rea&s;on will pre|clude the recital of the per&s;onal hazards and atchievements which happened in the cour&s;e of his &s;ervice. The tranquility on the fron|tiers of the middle colonies having been re|&s;tored by the &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, and the health of Colonel Wa&s;hington having be|come extrentely debilitated by an inveterate pulmonary complaint, in 1759 he re&s;igned his military appointment. Authentie documents are not wanting to &s;hew the tender regret which the Virginia line expre&s;&s;ed at parting with their commander, and the affectionate regard which he entertained for them.</P>
<P>Shortly after Colonel Wa&s;hington's re&s;ig|nation, his health was gradually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed and he, married Mrs. Cu&s;tis <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General and Mrs. Wa&s;hington were both born in the &s;ame year.</NOTE>, an amiable young widow, &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;tarling (about 88,900 dollars) in her own right, be&s;ides her dower in one of the principal e&s;lates in Vir|ginia. With this lady Colonel Wa&s;hington &s;ettled as a planter and farmer on his e&s;tate in Fairfax county, Virginia.</P>
<P>After &s;ome years he gave up planting to|bacco, and went altogether into the farming

Although he has confined his own cultivation to this dome&s;tic tract of about mine thou&s;and acres, yet he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es excellent lands, in large quantities, in &s;everal other coun|ties. His judgment in the quality of &s;oils, his command of money to avail him&s;elf of purcha&s;es, and his occa&s;ional employment in early li&s;e as a &s;urveyor, gave him opportuni|ties of making advantageous locations; many of which are much improved.</P>
<P>A&s;ter he le&s;t the army, until the year 1774, he thus cultivated the arts of peace. He was con&s;tantly a member of a&s;&s;embly, a magi&s;|trate of his county and a judge of the court, At this period he was appointed by the a&s;|&s;embly of Virginia, in conformity with the univer&s;al wi&s;h of the people, to be one of their four delegates at the fir&s;t General Con|gre&s;s of delegates from all the provinces, which net at Philadelphia on the 26th of October, 1774, and con&s;ilted of fi&s;ty-one members. It was with no &s;mall reluctance that he engaged again in the active &s;cenes of life; and we incerely believe that no motives but &s;uch as &s;pring from the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, &s;ould have prevailed upon him to relinqui&s;h the mo&s;t re&s;ined dome&s;tic plea&s;ure, which it

<P>His conduct as a general and commander in chief is well known. He underwent ma|ny hard&s;hips, dangers and difficulties and con
<PB N="62" REF="037222_0032_100C97F9D258E640">ducted his military operations with much &s;kill and ability.</P>
<P>It would not comport with the intended brevity of the pre&s;ent memoirs, for us to particularize, all his tran&s;actions in the cour&s;e of the revolutionary war, the impre&s;|&s;ion which they made, is yet fre&s;h in the mind of every citizen, they are al&s;o &s;o inti|mately connected with the American revolu|tion, a hi&s;tory of which will perhaps &s;oon be pre&s;ented to the public, from the mode&s;t pen of the hero him&s;elf, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We learn that General Wa&s;hington has le&s;t, in his legacy to Judge Wa&s;hington, a Hi&s;tory of the American Revolution, written by him&s;elf, accompanied with all the important documents.</NOTE> which will, no doubt, place the whole in a more eminent point of view than has hereto&s;ore appeared.</P>
<P>But it is hoped, po&s;terity will be taught, in what manner he transformed an undi&s;ci|plined body of pea&s;antry into a regular army of &s;oldiers. Commentaries on his cam|paigns would undoubtedly be highly intere&s;t|ing and in&s;tructive to future generations. The conduct of his fir&s;t campaign, in March, 1776, in compelling the Briti&s;h troops to abandon Bo&s;ton, by a bloodle&s;s victory, will merit a minute narration. But a volume would &s;carcely contain the mortifications he
<PB N="63" REF="037222_0032_100C97F9D258E640">experienced, and the hazards to which he was expo&s;ed in the years 1776 and 1777, in contending again&s;t the prowe&s;s of Britain, with an inadequate force. Her armies were far &s;uperior to his in number, well organized and di&s;ciplined, inured to a camp life, com|manded by officers well experienced in mili|tary tacticks, and aided by powerful fleets, while his was compo&s;ed of raw and undi&s;ci|plined pea&s;ants, "ju&s;t dragged from the ten|der &s;cenes of dome&s;tic life&mdash;unaccu&s;tomed to the din of arms&mdash;totally unacquainted with every kind of military &s;kill,"&mdash;un&s;ed to the &s;ubordination &s;o e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite in an ar|my, and often in want of arms, amunition, cloaths, and even food; often expo&s;ed to the inclemency of the weather, in the mo&s;t vig|orous &s;ea&s;ons, without tents or even a blan|ket, and di&s;couraged by the want of regular pay. The&s;e circum&s;tances fully account for the un&s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of his fir&s;t campaigns.</P>
<P>The battle of Long-I&s;land was fought in Augu&s;t, 1776; his army were driven from their po&s;ts by the Briti&s;h; above two thou|&s;and Americans fell on the field, and about half that number were taken pri&s;oners. Fort Wa&s;hington on York-I&s;land, &s;urrendered &s;oon after, with two thou&s;and pri&s;oners: De&s;er|tion and &s;ickne&s;s added to his misfortunes.
<PB N="64" REF="037222_0033_100C97FBD3C94EC0">His army, which, at the time Lord Howe landed on Long-I&s;land, amounted to twenty-five thou&s;and men, was now reduced to about one eighth part of the number.</P>
<P>The approach of winter happily checked the progre&s;s of the enemy. General Wa&s;h|ington's per&s;everance and intrepidity, im|proved this circum&s;tance into important ad|vantages. At Trenton, on the morning of the twenty-&s;ixth of December, he &s;urpri&s;ed a body of the enemy's troops, who, finding them&s;elyes &s;urrounded, without further re|&s;i&s;tance, agreed to lay down their arms.&mdash; Twenty-five o&s;&s;icers, and nearly one thou|&s;and &s;oldiers were made pri&s;oners; while the American army had only four or five men wounded.</P>
<P>On the third of January following, at Princeton, he made another &s;ucce&s;sful at|tempt, there he took three hundred pri&s;oners. The&s;e enterpri&s;es cheered the drooping &s;pi|rits of his men, and again added reputation to the American arms. He afterwards re|tired to Morri&s;town, and remained during the winter, with an inferior force, but with &s;uperior &s;kill, checking the enemy from any further encroachments in that part of the country. We &s;hall not enter into a minute de&s;cription of the various battles and &s;kir|mi&s;hes,
<PB N="65" REF="037222_0033_100C97FBD3C94EC0">in which he was per&s;onally engaged during the campa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gn of 1777. At the bat|tle of Brandywine, he made a gallant re&s;i&s;t|ance, but was at la&s;t forced to quit his ground with the lo&s;s of about twelve hundred men killed, wounded, or taken pri&s;oners. At Germantown he was repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of &s;ix hundred killed or wounded, and about four hundred pri&s;oners. He afterwards re|tired to winter quarters at Valley Forge. His army was at this time in a mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble condition, marching, without &s;tockings or &s;hoes, over the frozen ground, their feet were &s;o ga&s;hed, that their &s;teps were marked with blood: Some hundreds of them were with|out blankets; and in this condition they were in the middle of winter, to &s;it down in a fo|re&s;t, and build buts for a &s;helter. The de&s;|titute &s;ituation of the American army at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> times, was certainly a means of procra&s;tin|ating the war; o&s;tentimes it was upon the eve of di&s;&s;olution, even mutinies have been the con&s;equence, while want of &s;ucce&s;s, pre|vented many of the &s;oldiers from continuing longer than the period of their &s;hort enl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ments, and cau&s;ed frequent de&s;ertion. In|deed, nothing but the good de&s;tiny and con|&s;ummate prudence of the commander in chief, prevented want of &s;ucce&s;s from pro|ducing
<PB N="66" REF="037222_0034_100C97FD91271148">want of confidence on the part of the public; for want of &s;ucce&s;s is apt to lead to the adoption of pernicious coun&s;els, through the levity of the people or the am|bition of their demagogues. In the three &s;ucceeding years, the germ of di&s;cipline un|folded; and the re&s;ources of America hav|ing been called into co-operation with the land and naval armies of France, produced the glorious conclu&s;ion of the campaign in 1781. On the nineteenth of October that year, the army under command of General Wa&s;hington, forced that of the enemy, the under command of Lord Cornwallis, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> make a final &s;urrender; his land forces were made pri&s;oners of war to congrefs; and the naval forces were given up to France. From this time, the gloom began to di&s;appear from our political horizon, and the affairs of the union proceeded in a meliorating train, unti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a peace was mo&s;t ably negociated by our a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ba&s;&s;adors in Europe, in 1783, by which thir|teen of the American colonies were e&s;tab|li&s;hed as &s;overeign and independent &s;tates.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington having never been is Europe, he could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> much military &s;ervice when the armies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Britain were &s;ent to &s;ubdue America; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;till, for a variety of rea&s;ons, he was by much
<PB N="67" REF="037222_0034_100C97FD91271148">the mo&s;t proper man on this continent, and probably any where el&s;e, to be placed at the head of an American Army. The very high e&s;timation he &s;tood in for integrity and honour, his engaging in the cau&s;e of his country from &s;entiment and a conviction of her wrongs, his moderation in politics, his exten&s;ive property, and his approved abili|ties as a commander, were motives which nece&s;&s;arily obliged the choice of America to fall upon him.</P>
<P>That nature had given him extraordinary military talents, will hardly be controverted by his mo&s;t bitter enemies; and having been early actuated with a warm pa&s;&s;ion to &s;erve his country in the military line, he has greatly improved them by unwearied indu&s;|try, and a clo&s;e application to the be&s;t wri|ters upon tacticks, and by a more than com|mon method and exactne&s;s; and, in reality, when it comes to be con&s;idered, that at fir&s;t he only headed a body of men entirely un|acquainted with military di&s;cipline or opera|tions, &s;omewhat ungovernable in temper, and who at be&s;t could only be &s;tiled an alert and good militia, acting under very &s;hort enli&s;t|ments, unclothed, unaccoutred, and at all times very ill &s;upplied with ammunition and artillery; and that with &s;uch an army he

<P>No per&s;on, but tho&s;e who had an opportu|nity of viewing the continental army, can form any adequate idea of its imperfect &s;tate when General Wa&s;hington fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the command, nor was it without the mo&s;t un|wearied application and per&s;everance, which few men but him, could have undergone, that be was able to e&s;tabli&s;h that di&s;cipline which ultimately aided his &s;ucce&s;s.

<SALUTE>SIR.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable, and would be received with anxiety and concern; peculiarly happy &s;hould I o&s;teem my&s;elf, were it in my power at this time, to tran&s;mit &s;uch information to congre&s;s as would be more plea&s;ing and agree|able to their wi&s;hes:&mdash;but, unfortunately for me, &mdash;unfortunately for them, &mdash;it is not.</P>
<P>"Our &s;ituation is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The check our detachment &s;u&s;tained on the twen|ty-&s;eventh ultimo, has di&s;pirited t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> great a
<PB N="73" REF="037222_0037_100C98040420BF58">proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with apprehen&s;ion and de&s;pair. The militia, in&s;tead of calling forth their utmo&s;t efforts to a brave and manly oppo&s;ition in or|der to repair our lo&s;&s;es, are di&s;mayed, un|tractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off, &mdash;in &s;ome in&s;tances, almo&s;t by whole regiments, by half ones, and by companies at a time. This circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, independent of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy &s;u|perior in number to our whole collected force, would be &s;ufficiently di&s;agreeable: but, when their example has infected another part of the army, &mdash;when their want of di&s;cipline, and refu&s;al of almo&s;t every kind of re&s;traint and government, have produced a like con|duct but too common to the whole, and an entire di&s;regard of that order and &s;ubordina|tion nece&s;&s;ary to the well-doing of an army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our military e&s;tabli&s;hment would admit of, &mdash;our condition is &s;till more alarming: and with the deepe&s;t concern I am obliged to confe&s;s my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</P>
<P>"All the&s;e circum&s;tances fully confirm the opinion I ever entertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of
<PB N="74" REF="037222_0038_100C9806C99D0B58">mentioning to congre&s;s, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops than tho&s;e enli&s;ted and embodied for a long|er period than our regulations heretofore have pre&s;cribed. I am per&s;uaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lo&s;t, if their defence is left to any but a perma|nent &s;tanding army, &mdash;I mean, one to exi&s;t during the war. Nor would the expen&s;e, in|cient to the &s;upport of &s;uch a body of troops as would be competent to almo&s;t ev|ery exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in &s;uccour, and new en|li&s;tments, which, when effected, are not at|tended with any good con&s;equences. Meo who have been free, and &s;ubject to no con|trol, cannot been free, and &s;ubject to no con|trol, cannot be reduced to order in an in&s;tant: and the privileges and exemptions they clain and will have, influence the conduct of oth|ers; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the di&s;order, irregulari|ty and con&s;u&s;ion they occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the de&s;ired effect, When men can get double that &s;um to en|gage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia frequently called out, it is hardly
<PB N="75" REF="037222_0038_100C9806C99D0B58">to be expected. The addition of land might have a con&s;iderable in&s;luence on a permanent enli&s;tment."</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"FROM the hours allotted to &s;leep, I will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on &s;undry important matters to con|gre&s;s. I &s;hall offer them with the &s;incerity which ought to characteri&s;e a man of candor, and with the freedom which may be u&s;ed in giving u&s;eful information, without incurring the imputation of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>"We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another di&s;&s;olution of our army. The re|membrance of the difficulties which happen|ed upon the occa&s;ion la&s;t year, the con&s;equen|ces which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the en|emy, added to a knowledge of the pre|&s;ent temper and &s;ituation of the troops, re|flect but a gloomy pro&s;pect upon the appear|ances of things now, and fatisfy me beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ubt, that, unle&s;s &s;ome
<PB N="76" REF="037222_0039_100C980859AFBAB8">&s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures are adopted by congre&s;s, our cau&s;e will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>"It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the &s;ervice on the encouragement offered by congre&s;s, When men find that their town&s;men and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more doliars, for a few months' &s;ervice (which is truly the ca&s;e, it cannot be expected, without u&s;ing compul|&s;ion; and to force them into the &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce would an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e. When men are irritated, and the pa&s;&s;ions in&s;lamed, they fly ha&s;tily and cheerfully to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms; but after the fir&s;t emotions are over * * *, a &s;oldier, rea&s;oned with upon the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e he is engaged in, and the ine&s;timable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of your ob&s;erva|tions, but adds, that it is of no more impor|tance to him than others. The officer makes you the &s;ame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not &s;upport him, and he can|not ruin him&s;elf and tamily to &s;erve his coun|try, when every member of the community is equally intere&s;ted and benefined by his la|bours. * * *</P>
<P>"It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conte&s;t is not likely to be the work of a
<PB N="77" REF="037222_0039_100C980859AFBAB8">day, &mdash;as the war mu&s;t be carried on &s;y&s;tema|tically, &mdash;and to do it you mu&s;t have good of|ficers, &mdash;there are, in my judgment, no other po&s;&s;ible means to obtain them but by e&s;tab|li&s;hing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your o&s;&s;icers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and men of character to engage: and, till the bulk of your officers are compo&s;ed of &s;uch per&s;ons as are actuated by principles of honor and a &s;pirit of enter|pri&s;e, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have &s;uch allowances as will enable them to live like and &s;upport the characters of gentlemen. * * * Be&s;ides, &s;omething is due to the man who puts his life in [<HI>your</HI>] hands, hazards his health, and for|&s;akes the &s;weets of dome&s;tic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continental &s;ervice thould re|ceive no more than five th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilings currency per day for performing the &s;ame duties that an of|ficer of the &s;ame rank in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice re|ceives ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hillings &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling for, I never could concerve, e&s;pecially when the latter is provid|ed with every nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y he requires upon the be&s;t terms, and the former can &s;carce pro|cure th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m at any rate. There is nothing that gives a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n con&s;equence and renders him fit for comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, like a &s;upport that renders him
<PB N="78" REF="037222_0040_100C980B278439E8">independent of every body but the &s;tate he &s;erves.</P>
<P>"With re&s;pect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a perma|nent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bli&s;hment; and for no &s;horter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts inconte&s;tibly prove that the difficulty and co&s;t of enli&s;tments in|cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e with time. When the army was fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at Cambridge, I am per&s;uaded that the men might have been got, without a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">unty, for the war. After this they began to &s;ee that the conte&s;t was not likely to end &s;o &s;peedily as was imagined, and to feel their con&s;equence by remarking, that, to get in the militia in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty</P>
<P>"Fore&s;ecing the evils re&s;uiting from this, and the de&s;tructive con&s;equences which una|voidably would follow &s;hort en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recol|lected, as my letter book is not bere) to recom|mend the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;tments for and during the war, a&s;&s;igning &s;uch rea&s;ons for it as experience has &s;ince convinced me were well founded. At that time, twenty dollars would, I am per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ded, have engaged the men for this term. But it will not do to look book: and if the pre&s;ent opportunity is &s;ipped, I am per&s;uad|ed
<PB N="79" REF="037222_0040_100C980B278439E8">that twelve months more will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;e our difficulties four-fold. I &s;hall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately oftered, anded by the proffer of at lea&s;t a hunched or a hunadred and fifty acres of land, and a &s;uit of clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es and blanket to each non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and &s;eldier; as I have good authority for &s;ay|ing, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely &s;ufficient, in the pre&s;ent &s;carcity and dearne&s;s of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much le&s;s aftord &s;up|port to their families.</P>
<P>"If this oncoura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ement then is given to the men, and &s;uch pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlement of character and liber|al &s;entiments to engage, and proper care and precation u&s;ed in the nomination (having more regard to the characters of per&s;ons than the number of men they can enli&s;t,) we thould in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be oppo&s;ed to it, as there are ex|cellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer po&s;&s;osses is his ability to rai&s;e men, while tho&s;e men con&s;ider and treat him as an equal, and (in the char|acter of an officer) regard him no more than a broom&s;&s;ick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor di&s;cipline can
<PB N="80" REF="037222_0041_100C980D4960AE38">prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that re&s;pect which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to due &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>"To place any dependence upon militis, is a&s;&s;uredly re&s;ting upon a broken &s;taff, &mdash;men ju&s;t dragged from the tender &s;cenes of dome&s;|tic life, &mdash;unaccu&s;tomed to the din of arms, &mdash; totally unacquainted with every kind of mili|tary &s;kill; which being followed by a want of confidence in them&s;elves, when oppo&s;ed to troops regularly trained, di&s;ciplined, and ap|pointed, &s;uperior in knowledge, and &s;uperior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own &s;hadows. Be&s;ides, the &s;ud|den change in their manner of living (parti|cularly in the lodging) brings on &s;ickne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> many, impatience in all, and &s;uch an uncon|querable de&s;ire of returning to their re&s;pec|tive homes, that it not only produces &s;hame|ful and &s;candalous de&s;ertions among them|&s;elves, but infu&s;es the like &s;pirit into others.</P>
<P>"Again; men accu&s;tomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the re&s;traint which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and every kind of di&s;order triumphantly reign. To bring men to a proper degree of &s;ubordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even a
<PB N="81" REF="037222_0041_100C980D4960AE38">year: and unhappily for us and the cau&s;e we are engaged in, the little di&s;cipline I have been laboring to e&s;tabli&s;h in the army under my immediate command, is in a manner done away, by having &s;uch a mixture of troops as have been called together within the&s;e few months.</P>
<P>"Relaxed and unfit as our rules and reg|ulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (tho&s;e properly &s;o called; for of the&s;e we have two &s;orts, the &s;ix-months-men, and tho&s;e &s;ent in as a tempora|ry aid) do not think them&s;elves &s;ubject to them, and therefore take liberties which the &s;oldier is puni&s;hed for. This creates jea|lou&s;y: jealou&s;y begets di&s;&s;atisfactions; and the&s;e by degrees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a confu&s;ed and di&s;ordered &s;tate, &mdash;rendering the time of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee regularity and good order prevail, more unhappy than words can de&s;cribe. Be|&s;ides this, &s;uch repeated changes ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e place, that all arrangement is &s;et at nought, and the con&s;tant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fa&s;t as adopted.</P>

If the&s;e evils can be remedied, the expen&s;e and trouble ought not to be ob&s;tacles. Though &s;ome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which, together with &s;our krout and vinegar, might ea&s;ily be had, if proper per&s;ons acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s were em|ployed therein.</P>
<P>"Soap is another article in great demand, the continental allowance is too &s;mall: and, dear as every nece&s;&s;ary of life is now got, a &s;oldier's pay will not enable him to purcha&s;e; by which means his con&s;equent dirtine&s;s adds not a little to the di&s;ea&s;es of the army.</P>
<P>"I have no rea&s;on to accu&s;e the clothier-general of inattention to his department; and therefore, as his &s;upplies are incompetent to the wants of the army. I am to &s;uppo&s;e his re&s;ources are unequal. Ought not each &s;tate then to be called upon to draw &s;uch &s;upplies from the country manufactories, as can be af|forded? particularly of &s;hoes, &s;tockings, &s;hirts and blankets, &mdash;articles indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="88" REF="037222_0045_100C98171BD38CE8">and of which &s;carce too many can be provided:&mdash;in the mean while every provi&s;ion to be making, for clothing the troops uni|formly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illu&s;tration, that no|thing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On the&s;e the health, comfort and &s;pirits of the &s;oldiers e&s;&s;entially depend; and it is a me|lancholy fact, that the American army are mi&s;erably defective in both the&s;e re&s;pects. The di&s;tre&s;s mo&s;t of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity, di&s;piriting to them&s;elves, and di&s;couraging to every officer. It makes every pretention to the pre&s;ervation of cleanline&s;s impo&s;&s;ible, expo&s;es them to a variety of di&s;orders, and abates or de&s;troys that military pride without which nothing can be expected from any army,</P>
<P>"The con&s;equence of giving rank indi&s;|criminately is much to be dreaded: great di&s;&s;atisfaction has already ari&s;en on account, of be&s;towing this on officers in the civil de|partments of the army, on the in&s;erior &s;taff, waggon-ma&s;ter, &amp;c. who, by cu&s;tom, pro|priety, and every other motive, are ex|cluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liberality practi&s;ed in this re&s;|pect will de&s;troy the pride of rank where it
<PB N="89" REF="037222_0045_100C98171BD38CE8">ought to exi&s;t, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and re&s;pect|ed, as a &s;timulus to emulation, and an incite|ment to bold and gallant undertakings: it mu&s;t be very unadvi&s;eable therefore, in our infant &s;tate of war, to adopt novel cu&s;toms to bring it it into di&s;credit&mdash;which mu&s;t and will be the con&s;equence of making it too common, be&s;ides the di&s;gu&s;t it creates in others.</P>
<P>"An auditor of accounts, to be con&s;tantly with the army, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite. It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me, crowded as I am with other bu&s;ine&s;s, to examine and ad|ju&s;t the numerous complex accounts of the army with that correctne&s;s the public have a right to expect, before warrants pa&s;s for pay|ment; and, without doing it, great impo&s;i|tions may follow. The provi&s;ion for making regimental pay-ma&s;ters regulate all regimen|tal accounts is altogether incompetent to the end propo&s;ed from it: for the&s;e men being appointed generally agreeable to the recom|men lation of the field officers of the regi|ments they belong to&mdash;a&s;&s;ociating con&s;tantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great mea&s;ure under their control&mdash;cannot be con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently uninfluenced; nor

<P>"I under&s;tand that the officers, engaged in the cau&s;e of liberty and their country, who by the fourtune of war, have fallen into your hands, have been thrown indi&s;criminately in|to a common jail, appropriated for felons&mdash;that no con&s;ideration has been had for tho&s;e of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable rank, when langui&s;h|ing with wounds and &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;that &s;ome of them have been even amputated in this un|worthy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Let your opinion, &s;ir, of the principle which actuates them, be what it may, they &s;uppo&s;e they act from the noble&s;t of all princi|ples, a love of freedom and their country. But political opinions, I conceive, are fo|reign to this point, The obligations ari&s;ing from the right of humanity and claims of rank, are univer&s;ally binding and exten&s;ive, except in ca&s;e of retaliation. The&s;e I &s;hould have hoped, would have dictated a more ten|der treatment of tho&s;e individuals, whom
<PB N="94" REF="037222_0048_100C981EF785BEC0">chance or war had put in your power. Nor can I forbear &s;ugge&s;ting its fatal tendency to widen that unhappy breach, which you, and tho&s;e mini&s;ters under whom you act, have re|peatedly declared you wi&s;h to &s;eeforever clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"My duty now makes it nece&s;&s;ary to sp. pri&s;e you, that for the future, I &s;hall regular my conduct towards tho&s;e gentlemen of your army, who are, or may be in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, exactly by the rule you &s;hall ob&s;erve towards tho&s;e of ours who may be in your cu&s;tody.</P>

<P>"TO the glory of civilized nations, hu|manity and war have been compatible; and
<PB N="95" REF="037222_0048_100C981EF785BEC0">compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubdued is become almo&s;t a general &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>"Britons, ever pre-eminent in mercy; have outgone common examples, and overlooked the criminal in the captive. Upon the&s;e principles, your pri&s;oners, who&s;e lives, by the laws of the land, are de&s;tined to the cord, have hitherto been treated with care and kindne&s;s, and more comfortably lodged, than the king's troops, in the ho&s;pitals; indi&s;crim|inately, it is true, for I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the king.</P>
<P>"My intelligence from your army would ju&s;tify &s;evere recrimination, I under&s;tand there are &s;ome of the king's faithful &s;ubjects, ta|ken &s;ome time &s;ince by the rebels, labouring like negro &s;laves, to gain their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, or reduced to the wretched alternative, to peri&s;h by famine, or take arms again&s;t their king and country. Tho&s;e, who have made the treatment of the pri&s;oners in my hands, or of your other friends in Bo&s;ton, a pre|tence for &s;uch mea&s;ures, found barbarity up|on &s;al&s;hood.</P>
<P>"I would willingly hope, &s;ir, that the &s;en|timents of liberality, which I have always be|lieved you to po&s;&s;e&s;s, will be exerted to cor|rect their mi&s;doings. Be temperate in politi|cal di&s;qui&s;itions, give free operation to truth,

<P>"Should tho&s;e, under who&s;e u&s;urped au|thority you act, control &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and dare to call &s;everity retaliation, to God, who knows all hearts, be the appeal for the dread|ful con&s;equences.

<P>"Till I read your in&s;inuations in regard to mini&s;ters, I conceived that I had acted under the king; who&s;e wi&s;hes it is true, as well as tho&s;e of his mini&s;ters, and of every hone&s;t man, have been to &s;ee this unhappy breach forever clo&s;ed; but unfortunately for both countries, tho&s;e, who have long &s;ince projected the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, and influence the councils of America, have views very di&s;tant from ac|commodation.

<P>"I addre&s;&s;ed you on the 11th in&s;tant in terms which gave the faire&s;t &s;cope for the exerci&s;e of that humanity and politene&s;s, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to form a part of your character. I remon&s;trated with you on the unworthy treatment &s;newn to the officers and citizens of America, whom the fortune of war, chance, or a mi&s;taken confidence, had thrown into your hands.</P>
<P>"Whether Briti&s;h or American mercy, fortitude, and patience, are mo&s;t pre-eminent, &mdash;whether our virtuous citizens, whom the hand of tyranny has forced into arms, to de|fend their wives, heir children, and their property, or the mercenary in&s;truments of lawle&s;s domination, avarice and revenge, be&s;t de&s;erve the appellation of rebels, and the puni&s;hment of that cord, which your affected clemency has forborn to inflict&mdash;whether the authority under which I act, is u&s;urped, or &s;ounded on the genuine principles of liberty, were altogether foreign to the &s;ubject. I purpo&s;ely avoided all political di&s;qui&s;ition, nor &s;hall I now avail my&s;elf of tho&s;e advan|tages, which the &s;acred cau&s;e of my country,
<PB N="98" REF="037222_0050_100C9822E8CBB5D8">of liberty, and human nature, give me over you; much le&s;s &s;hall I &s;toop to retort any in|vective. But the intelligence, you &s;ay you have received from our army, requires a re|ply. I have taken time, &s;ir, to make a &s;trict enquiry, and find that it has not the lea&s;t foundation in truth. Not only your officers and &s;oldiers have been treated with a tender|ne&s;s due to fellow-citizens and brethren, but even tho&s;e execrable paracides, who&s;e coun|cils and aid have deluged their country with blood, have been protected from the fury of a ju&s;tly enraged people. Far from compelling or permitting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I am embar|ra&s;&s;ed with the numbers who croud to our camp, animated with the pure&s;t principles of virtue and love of their country. You advi&s;e me to give free operation to truth; to puni&s;h mi&s;repre&s;entation and fal&s;hood. If experi|ence &s;tamps value upon coun&s;el, yours mu&s;t have a weight which few can claim. You be&s;t can tell, how far the convul&s;ion, which has brought &s;uch ruin on both countries, and &s;haken the mighty empire of Britain to its foundation, may be traced to the&s;e malignant cau&s;es.</P>
<P>"You affect, &s;ir, to de&s;pi&s;e all rank, not derived from the &s;ame &s;ource with your own. I cannot conceive one more honorable, than
<PB N="99" REF="037222_0050_100C9822E8CBB5D8">that which flows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people, the pure&s;t &s;ource and original fountain of all power.&mdash; Far from making it a plea for cruelty, a mind of true magnanimity and enlarged ideas, would comprehend and re&s;pect it.</P>
<P>"What may have been the mini&s;terial views which have precipitated the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, Lexington, Concord, and Charle&s;town, can be&s;t declare. May that God, to whom you then appealed, judge between America and you. Under his providence, tho&s;e who influence the councils of America, and all the other inhabitants of the united colonies, at the hazard of their lives, are determined to hand down to po&s;terity, tho&s;e ju&s;t and invalu|able privileges which they received from their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall now, &s;ir, clo&s;e my corre&s;pon|dence with you, perhaps for ever. If your officers, our pri&s;oners, receive a treatment from me, different from what I wi&s;hed to &s;hew them, they and you will remember the oc|ca&s;ion of it.</P>

<P>The United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled, after giving the mo&s;t honor|able te&s;timony to the federal armies, and pre&s;enting them with the thanks of their country, for their long, eminent, and faithful &s;ervices&mdash;having thought proper, by their proclamation, bearing date the 18th of October la&s;t, to di&s;|charge &s;uch part of the troops as were engaged for the war, and to permit the officers on furlough to retire from &s;er|vice, from and after to-morrow, which proclamation having been communicat|ed in the public papers for the informa|tion and government of all concerned; it only remains for the commander in chief to addre&s;s him&s;elf once more, and that for the la&s;t time, to the armies of the United States (however widely di&s;|per&s;ed the individuals who compo&s;ed
<PB N="112" REF="037222_0057_100C982B21A91C78">them may be) and to bid them an af|fectionate &mdash;a long farewell.</P>
<P>But before the commander in chief takes his final leave of tho&s;e he holds mo&s;t dear, he wi&s;hes to indulge him|&s;elf a few moments in calling to mind a &s;light review of the pa&s;t&mdash;he will then take the liberty of exploring, with his military friends, their future pro&s;pects, of advi&s;ing the general line of conduct which, in his opinion, ought to be pur|&s;ued; and he will conclude the ad|dre&s;s, by expre&s;&s;ing the obligations he feels him&s;elf under for the &s;pirited and able a&s;&s;i&s;tance he has experienced from thern, in the performance of an ardu|ous office.</P>
<P>A contemplation of the complete at|tainment, at a period earlier than could have been expected, of the object for which we contended, again&s;t &s;o formid|able a power, cannot but in&s;pire us with a&s;toni&s;hment and gratitude. The dif|advantageous circum&s;tances on our part, under which the war was under|taken,
<PB N="113" REF="037222_0057_100C982B21A91C78">can never be forgotten. The &s;ingular interpo&s;itions of providence in our feeble condition, were &s;uch as could &s;carcely e&s;cape the attention of the mo&s;t unob&s;erving; while the unparalled per&s;everance of the armies of the U|nited States, through almo&s;t every po&s;|fible &s;uffering and di&s;couragement, for the &s;pace of eight long years, was little &s;hort of a &s;tanding miracle.</P>
<P>It is not the meaning, nor within the compa&s;s of this addre&s;s, to detail the hard&s;hips peculiarly incident to our &s;er|vice, or to de&s;cribe the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which, in &s;everal in&s;yances, have re&s;ulted from the extremes of hunger and nakedne&s;s, combined with the rigors of an incle|ment &s;ea&s;on; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to dwell on the dark &s;ide of our pa&s;t af|fairs. Every American officer and &s;ol|dier mu&s;t now con&s;ole him&s;elf for any unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances which may have occurred by the recollection of the uncommon &s;cenes in which he has been called to act no inglorious part,

<P>The commander in chief conceives little is now wanting to enable the &s;old|dier to change his military character into that of the citizen, but that &s;teady and decent tenor of behavour, which has generally di&s;tingui&s;hed, not only the army under his immediate command, but the different detachments and &s;e|parate armies, through the cour&s;e of

Upon this reque&s;t, the legi&s;lature of Vir|ginia, repealed &s;o much of the act referred to as related to the ve&s;ting the above-mentioned &s;hares in General Wa&s;hington and heirs, and enacted that the &s;hares and profits accruing therefrom, &s;hould &s;tand appropriated to &s;uch objects of a public nature as his Excellency &s;hould direct and appoint.

<P>General Wa&s;hington having retired from all public employment, now a&s;&s;umed the cha|racter of a private gentleman, he employed him&s;elf in improving his farms and planta|tion, and in cultivating the arts of peace.&mdash; But in this retreat of happine&s;s and rural &s;implicity he was not &s;u&s;&s;ered long to remain, it was too &s;oon for the <HI>father of America</HI> to leave his in&s;ant care, his well tried virtues were generally and ju&s;tly known to his fellow|citizens, and their confidence in his judg|ment, experience and di&s;intere&s;ted patriot|i&s;m, was univer&s;al even to enthu&s;ia&s;m. Four years had not expired from the period at which he re&s;igned his military command, when the voice of his country again called
<PB N="136" REF="037222_0069_100C9848597C4AC0">him to its &s;ervice&mdash;in the year 1787, he was elected a delegate to the federal convention which met at Philadelphia to form the new con&s;titution, and was cho&s;en pre&s;ident there|of. Whatever difference of &s;entiment there might have been among&s;t the citizens with re|gard to the principle, &s;tructure, or adoption of the new con&s;titution, there appeared but one &s;entiment as to the man who &s;hould &s;it at the helm of its admini&s;tration. General Wa&s;hington, after the adoption of the federal con&s;titution, was, on the 6th of April, 1789, unanimou&s;ly elected Pre&s;ident of the United States&mdash;whereupon the citizens te&s;tified with becoming joy, their confidence and approba|tion at his appointment to the office of chief magi&s;trate, and innumerable addre&s;&s;es reitera|ted his prai&s;e from every part of the union.</P>
<P>His triumphal entry into Philadelphia on his way to New-York, the &s;eat of govern|ment, to a&s;&s;ume the duties of his important office, merit a minute de&s;cription, Early on the morning of the 20th of April, his Excel|lency Thomas Mifflin, E&s;q. governor of the &s;tate, the Hon. Richard Peters, E&s;q. &s;peaker of the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, the old city troop of hor&s;e, and another troop from the city commanded by captain Bingham, waited the arrival of their beloved <HI>Washington,</HI> at

<P>After paying him the tribute of military honor due to his rank and exalted character, by proper &s;alutes and otherwi&s;e, they e&s;cort|ed him into Che&s;ter, where they breakfa&s;ted, and re&s;ted a couple of hours.</P>
<P>This great and worthy man, finding he could not po&s;iibly elude the parade which ne|ce&s;&s;arily mu&s;t attend manife&s;tations of joy and affection, when di&s;played by a grateful peo|ple, to their patriot benefactor, ordered his carriages into the rear of the whole line, and mounted an elegant hor&s;e, accompanied by the venerable patriot Charles Thom&s;on, E&s;q. and his former aid-de-camp, the celebrated Colonel Humphries; both of whom were al&s;o on hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>On their way to the city, they were joined by detachments from the Che&s;ter and Phila|delphia troops of hor&s;e, and al&s;o by a num|ber of re&s;pectable citizens, at who&s;e head was the worthy citizen and &s;oldier, his Excellen|cy Arthur St. Clair, E&s;q. governor of the We&s;tern Territory. Thus they proceeded to Gray's ferry, on Schuylkill; ob&s;erving the &s;tricte&s;t order and regularity during the march. But here &s;uch a &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf, that
<PB N="138" REF="037222_0070_100C984A38E06108">even the pencil of a Raphael could not de|lineate.</P>
<P>The bridge was highly decorated with laurel and other evergreens, by Mr. Gray, the ingenious Mr. Peale, and others, and in &s;uch a &s;tyle as to di&s;play uncommon ta&s;te in the&s;e gentlemen. At each end there were erected magnificent arches, compo&s;ed of lan|rel, emblematical of the ancient triumphal arches, u&s;ed by the Romans, and on each &s;ide of the bridge, a laurel &s;hrubbery, which &s;eem|ed to challenge even nature her&s;elf, for &s;im|plicity, ea&s;e and elegance. And as our be|loved WASHINGTON pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, a lad, beautifully ornamented with &s;prigs of laurel, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by certain machinery, let drop, above the hero's head, unperceived by him, a civic crown of laurel. There was al&s;o a very ele|gant di&s;play of variegated flags on each &s;ide of the bridge, as well as other places, which alternately caught the eye, and filled the &s;pec|tator's &s;oul with admiration and delight.</P>
<P>But who can de&s;cribe the heart-felt congra|tulations of more than twenty thou&s;and free citizens, who lined every fence, field, and avenue between the bridge and city? The aged &s;ire, the venerable matron, the bloom|ing virgin, and the ruddy youth, were all emulous in their plaudits&mdash;nay the li&s;ping
<PB N="139" REF="037222_0070_100C984A38E06108">infant did not withhold its innocent &s;mile of prai&s;e and approbation.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions of ci|tizens di&s;covered (and they felt what they di&s;covered) the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed attachment and unbounded zeal for their dear chief, and I may add, under God, the Saviour of their country. Not all the pomp of maje&s;ty, not even imperial dignity it&s;elf, &s;urrounded with its u&s;ual &s;plendor and magnificence, could equal this intere&s;ting &s;cene.</P>
<P>On approaching near the city, our illu&s;|trious chief was highly gratified with a fur|ther military di&s;play of intantry, and artillery, who joined in the proce&s;&s;ion, and thou&s;ands of freemon, who&s;e hearts burned with patri|otic fire, al&s;o fell into the ranks, almo&s;t every &s;quare they marched, until the column &s;welled beyond credibility it&s;elf, and having conduct|ed the man of their hearts to the city tavern, he was introduced to a very grand and plenti|ful banquet, which was prepared for him by the citizens. At dinner, thirteen patriotic toa&s;ts were drank. The plea&s;ures and te&s;ti|vity of the day being over, they were &s;ucceed|ed by a hand&s;ome di&s;play of fire-works in the evening; this may give a faint idea of this glorious proce&s;&s;ion, and of the univer&s;al

<P>"Among the vici&s;&s;itudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties, than that, of which the notification was tran&s;mitted by your order, and received on the fourteenth day of the pre&s;ent month: on the one hand, I was &s;ummoned by my country, who&s;e voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had cho&s;en with the fonde&s;t predeliction, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deci&s;ion, as the a&s;ylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more nece&s;&s;ary, as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to in|clination, and of frequent interruptions

All I dare hope, is, that if, in executing this ta&s;k, I have been too much &s;wayed by a grateful remembrance of former in&s;tances, or by an affectionate &s;en&s;ibility to this tran|&s;cendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens&mdash;and have thence too little con&s;ulted my incapacity as well as
<PB N="142" REF="037222_0072_100C985084925190">di&s;inclination for the weighty and un|tried cares before me&mdash;my error will be palliated by the motives which mi&s;|lead me, and its con&s;equences be judged by my country, with &s;ome &s;hare of the partiality in which they originated.</P>
<P>"Such being the impre&s;&s;ions under which I have, in obedience to the pub|lic &s;ummons, repaired to the pre&s;ent &s;tation&mdash;it would be peculiarly impro|per to omit in the fir&s;t official act, my fervent &s;upplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the univer&s;e, who precides in the councils of nations, &mdash; and who&s;e providential aids can &s;upply every human defect, that his benedic|tion may con&s;ecrate to the liberties and happine&s;s of the people of the United States, a government in&s;tituted by them|&s;elves for the&s;e e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es: and may enable every in&s;trument, employed in its admini&s;tration, to execute with &s;ucce&s;s the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the great Author of every public and

No peo|ple can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invi&s;ible hand, which con|ducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every &s;tep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome tokens of providential agency. And in the important revolution ju&s;t accompli&s;hed in the &s;y&s;tem of their Uni|ted government, the tranquil delibera|tions and voluntary con&s;ent of &s;o many di&s;tinct communities, from which the event has re&s;ulted, cannot be compared with the means by which mo&s;t govern|ments have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, without &s;ome return of pious gratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future ble&s;&s;ings which the pa&s;t &s;eem to pre&s;age.

<P>"By the article e&s;tabli&s;hing the exe|cutive department, it is made the duty of the pre&s;ident "to recommend to your con&s;ideration &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary and expedient." The circum&s;tances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that &s;ubject, farther than to refer to the great con&s;titutional charter under which you are a&s;&s;embled; and which, in defining your powers, de&s;ignates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and far more con|genial with the feelings which actuate me, to &s;ub&s;titute in place of a recom|mendation of particular mea&s;ures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patrioti&s;m which

<P>"To the preceding ob&s;ervations, I have one to add, which will be mo&s;t properly addre&s;&s;ed to the hou&s;e of re|pre&s;entatives. It concerns my&s;elf, and therefore will be as brief as po&s;&s;ible. when I was fir&s;t honored with a call in|to the &s;ervice of my country, then on

<P>The fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, under the new con&s;titution, continued their &s;ittings from the 4th of March until the 29th of Septem|ber, their attention was chiefly directed to|wards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of various regulations for the re&s;toration of the public credit of the United States, and other objects of political economy. During the period of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Pre&s;ident re&s;ided at New-York, &s;anction|ing the proceedings of the legi&s;lature, and otherwi&s;e organizing the federal government. Shortly after the riting of congre&s;s, he made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tour to the &s;tates of Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts,
<PB N="150" REF="037222_0076_100C98598D7213E0">&s;etts, and N. Hamp&s;hire, attended by Me&s;&s;rs. Lear and Jack&s;on, his &s;ecretaries. In every part of the country through which he pa&s;&s;ed, the citizens embraced the opportunity of per&s;onally te&s;tifying their e&s;teem and re&s;pect of the <HI>man of their choice,</HI> in who&s;e character, whatever is great and good&mdash;whatever dig|nifies and adorns human nature, are &s;o happi|ly united. All that a grateful people could pay, was paid, whenever he approached a town or village, the roads were lined with ci|tizens to hail him welcome, &mdash;the military e&s;|corted him from place to place. Particularly to relate all the grateful te&s;timonials which were paid him during this vi&s;it, is impo&s;&s;ible from their number. If our limits would per|mit, a de&s;cription of the manner in which he was received at Bo&s;ton would be particularly intere&s;ting; nor can we &s;pecify the numer|ous congratulatory addre&s;&s;es which were pre|&s;ented him. But no particular circum&s;tance gave him more plea&s;ure, during his whole tour, than the plain and hearty manner in which Mr. Northey, the chairman of the &s;e|lectmen at Salem received him. This gen|tleman is of the &s;ociety of Friends, and when the Pre&s;ident was pre&s;ented to the &s;e|lectmen, Mr. Northey being covered, took him by the hand and &s;aid, "Friend Wa&s;hing|ton,
<PB N="151" REF="037222_0076_100C98598D7213E0">we are glad to &s;ee thee, and in behalf of the inhabitants, bid thee a hearty welcome to Salem."</P>
<P>On his arrival at Newburyport, the follow|ing incident occurred, a poor old &s;oldier, na|ned Cotton, who was with him in the me|morable battle on the Ohio, when Braddock was defeated, reque&s;ted, and was admitted into the room where the Pre&s;ident was, &mdash;on the &s;oldier's a&s;king "<HI>how Major Washington lid?</HI>" the Pre&s;ident immediately recollected his per&s;on, and ri&s;ing from his chair, took him by the hand, and tenderly enquired into the &s;cenes of his life, and pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, "I thank God," an&s;wered the &s;oldier, "that I have an opportunity of &s;eeing my old com|mander once more, I have &s;een him in adver|fity, and now &s;eeing him in glory, I can go home and die contented." The next morn|ing, he came again to take leave of the Pre|&s;ident, who gave him a guinea, which he ac|cepted he &s;aid, "merely as a token in remem|brance of his commander," and which he wore pendent on his bo&s;om, declaring that nothing earthly &s;hould &s;eparate it from him.</P>
<P>While General Wa&s;hington was Pre&s;ident of the United States, the following circum|&s;tance, which does honor to his humanity oc|curred. One Reuben Rouzy, of Virginia,
<PB N="152" REF="037222_0077_100C985C5A12C630">owed him about a thou&s;and pounds; one of the Pre&s;ident's agents brought a &s;uit for the money, judgment was obtained, and execu|tion i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the body of the defendant, who was taken to goal. He had a con&s;idera|ble landed property, but this kind of pro|perty, cannot be &s;old in Virginia for debts, unle&s;s at the di&s;cretion of the per&s;on. He had a large family, and pre&s;erred lying in goal to &s;elling his land, for the &s;ake of his children. &mdash;Some of his acquaintance hinted to him, that probably General Wa&s;hington did not know any thing of the proceeding, and it might be well to &s;end him a petition, with a &s;tatement of the circum&s;tances. He did &s;o, and the very next po&s;t from Philadelphia, af|ter his petition arrived, brought him a relea&s;e|ment, with a &s;evere <HI>reprimand</HI> on the agent for acting in &s;uch a cruel manner without con&s;ent. Poor Rouzy was, in con&s;equence, re&s;tored to his family and happine&s;s, who ne|ver laid down their heads at night, without offering their prayers to Heaven for our <HI>much beloved</HI> WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>On the 4th of January 1790, congre&s;s held their &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion at New-York. The Pre|&s;ident opened it with a &s;peech, he congratula|ted them on the &s;avorable pro&s;pects which the public affairs then a&s;&s;umed; the acce&s;tion of
<PB N="153" REF="037222_0077_100C985C5A12C630">the &s;tate of North-Carolina to the Union, the ri&s;ing credit and re&s;pectability of the coun|try, and the concord, peace and plenty with which they were ble&s;&s;ed: he directed their attention towards the making provi&s;ion for the common defence, a&s;&s;uring them that "to be prepared for war, is one of the mo&s;t ef|fectual means of pre&s;eving peace, and that a free people ought not only to be armed but di&s;ciplined;" he recommended the pro|tection of the We&s;tern and Southern fron|tiers again&s;t the depredations of the ho&s;tile Indians; the e&s;tabli&s;hment of intercour&s;e with other nations; the framing of an uni|form law for the naturalization of foreigners; the importance of uniformity in the currency, weights, and mea&s;ures throughout the Union; the advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures; the encouragement of exertions of &s;kill, and genius, and to facili|tate the intercour&s;e between the di&s;tant parts of the country, by a due attention to the po&s;t-o&s;tice and po&s;t-roads. He particu|larly recommended the promotion of &s;cience and literature, as the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is of public happine&s;s, and be&s;t means of &s;ecuring a free con&s;titution, by teaching the people to know and to value their rights, to di&s;cern and provide again&s;t innovations of them, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="154" REF="037222_0078_100C985E07D9C7E8">between oppre&s;&s;ion and the nece&s;&s;ary ex|erci&s;e of lawful authority, to de&s;criminate the &s;pirit of liberty from that of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, cherri&s;hing the fir&s;t, avoiding the la&s;t, and uni|ting a &s;peedy but temperate vigilance again&s;t encroachments, with an inviolable re&s;pect to the laws. He informed them that he had di|rected the papers and e&s;timates to be laid be|fore them, which were nece&s;&s;ary to convey to them, that information of the &s;tate of the Union, which it was his duty to afford. He concluded by a&s;&s;uring them, that "He &s;hould derive great &s;atisfaction, from a co-operation with them, in the plea&s;ing, though arduous ta&s;k, of in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring to their fellow-citizens the ble&s;&s;ings which they have a right to expect from a free, efficient government."</P>
<P>This &s;e&s;&s;ion continued their &s;ittings until the 12th of Augu&s;t following; in that month the Pre&s;ident negotiated a treaty of Peace and friend&s;hip between the United States and the Creek nation of Indians; the ceremony took place at New-York, on the 30th of Septem|ber. The &s;ame year General Harmar, with 320 United States troops and 1, 133 mi|litia, gave battle to the Miami Indians, by whom he was defeated with the lo&s;s of 183 men killed, and 31 wounded; about 100 or upwards of the Indians were killed. The
<PB N="155" REF="037222_0078_100C985E07D9C7E8">Miami village containing about 100 Log hou|&s;es or wigwams, with 20,000 bu&s;hels of corn, was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The third &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s met on the 6th of December 1790, and ro&s;e on the 3d of March following; their deliberations were chiefly directed towards the regulation of commerce, further improvement of the judi|cial &s;y&s;tem, and making provi&s;ion for the appointment of con&s;uls in foreign countries. The &s;tate of Kentucky was admitted into the Union as a di&s;tinct &s;tate, and a loan was nego|ciated with the &s;tates of Holland.</P>
<P>The Indian war continued on the frontier of the &s;tates. During the &s;ummer of 1791, Gene|ral Scott &s;urpri&s;ed the Waba&s;h towns, he killed about thirty Indians, took fi&s;ty pri&s;on|ers and brought with him two hundred hor&s;es loaded with peltry and other articles of plun|der, with the lo&s;s of three men only. The attention of the Pre&s;ident during the period of this Congre&s;s, was chiefly directed towards the adoption of mea&s;ures for the protection of the froutiers, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of com|merce.</P>
<P>On the 24th of October 1791, the &s;econd Congre&s;s commenced their fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Pre&s;ident as u&s;ual opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion by a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, he began by remarking
<PB N="156" REF="037222_0079_100C9861B5E89D08">the abundance of the preceding harve&s;t, the progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, and the general and happy effects which had been produced by the revival of public and private confidence, to which the laws of the United States had &s;o eminently contributed. He mentioned the plan laid down for conciliating the friend&s;hip of the Indians; the ba&s;is of which was a &s;trict adherence to the dictates of ju&s;tice and humanity. The act for laying a duty on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, had been, he &s;aid, attended with &s;ome difficulty, from the want of expe|rience in the Federal government, to make the proper arrangements, and, in &s;ome parts of the union, there had been a mi&s;conception of its provi&s;ions; but he entertained no doubt that the di&s;content produced from it would be removed by a proper explanation of the law. The Pre&s;ident next ob&s;erved, that, agreeable to &s;everal acts on that &s;ubject, a di&s;trict of ten miles &s;quare, for the perma|nent &s;eat of the government of the United States, had been fixed upon, and announced by proclamation; that the di&s;trict compre|hended lands on both &s;ides of the Patowmac, and the towns of Alexandria and George|town; that a city had accordingly been laid out, and that there was every rea&s;on to ex|pect
<PB N="157" REF="037222_0079_100C9861B5E89D08">a due progre&s;s in the buildings. He al&s;o informed the two hou&s;es that a cen&s;us of the inhabitants of the United States, had been almo&s;t compleated, and afforded the plea&s;ing a&s;&s;urance that the pre&s;ent population bordered upon four millions of per&s;ons, that a further loan of two millions and an half of florins had been compleated in Holland upon terms &s;imilar to the la&s;t, and that another loan for &s;ix millions of florins had been &s;et on foot. He concluded by recommending to their particular attention, the &s;upporting of the militia on an effective plan; the admini&s;tra|tion of the po&s;t-office, the extention and im|provement of the po&s;t roads, the nece&s;&s;ity for a public mint, an uniformity of weights and mea&s;ures, and a provi&s;ion for the &s;ale of the vacant lands of the United States.</P>
<P>This &s;e&s;&s;ion continued their deliberations, until the 8th of May, 1792, when they ad|journed till the fir&s;t Monday of November following. During their &s;e&s;&s;ion and adjourn|ment, there was no remarkable or important event, a &s;eries of ma&s;&s;acres, were, as formerly committed on the frontiers, the hopes ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the Pre&s;ident, of being able to ac|commodate the di&s;putes with the Indians, did not prove &s;ucce&s;sful. On the 4th of No|vember, 1791, the United States army under
<PB N="158" REF="037222_0080_100C98636A521370">the command of General St. Clair was at|tacked by &s;urpri&s;e, within fifteen miles of the Miami village; the conte&s;t la&s;ted for four hours, when the Indians became victorious, the retreat of the Americans was accompli&s;h|ed with the lo&s;s of forty-&s;ix officers, &s;ix hun|dred privates, eight pieces of artillery and their whole baggage. In this battle, it is &s;aid, that twelve hundred Canadians fought under the di&s;gui&s;e of Indians. The attention of the Executive during this period, was al&s;o engaged in devi&s;ing modes to reconcile the citizens in &s;ome di&s;tricts of the union to the law, enacted for the purpo&s;e of collecting a certain duty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirits, di&s;tilled within the United States, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome of the provinces, par|ticularly the we&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n parts of Penn&s;ylvania, where a regular and formidable oppo&s;ition began to manife&s;t it&s;elf, in con&s;equence of which, the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of the Pre&s;i|dent was deemed advi&s;able. He i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation, recommending a compliance with the laws, and warning the citizens again&s;t all unlawful proceedings and combinations, having a tendency to ob&s;truct the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Congre&s;s met again in Novem|ber 1792. The Pre&s;ident opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, the greate&s;t part of which re|&s;pected the unfortunate endeavours to termi|nate
<PB N="159" REF="037222_0080_100C98636A521370">the Indian ho&s;tilities. He informed Con|gre&s;s of the oppo&s;ition which had been mani|fe&s;ted to the exci&s;e law, and recommended a revi&s;ion of the judiciary &s;y&s;tem. He further ob&s;erved, that three loans had been negociated for the u&s;e of the United States, one at Ant|werp, and two at Am&s;terdam, each for three millions of florins, on very rea&s;onable terms, which afforded a plea&s;ing evidence of the in|crea&s;ing credit of the new government. On the 2d of March 1793, this &s;e&s;&s;ion adjourned.</P>
<P>Heretofore the pro&s;perity of the United States met with little or no interruption, ex|cept from the ho&s;tility of the Indians. The attention of the executive was chiefly directed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the organization of the infant republic rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exten&s;ion of commerce and the di&s;putes of the European powers, ren|dered it nece&s;&s;ary for the United States to &s;end and receive, mini&s;ters and agents, for the better regulation of affairs.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure created troubles and perplexities hitherto unknown to the exe|cutive of the United States. On the 8th of April, 1793 Citizen Genet arrived at Charle&s;|ton, as mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the executive of France to the Pre&s;ident of the United States. On the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the &s;ame month

<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ion of congre&s;s, many im|portant laws were enacted.

During the year 1790, the congre&s;s of the United States found it nece&s;&s;ary "t lay and collect exci&s;es." This mode of taxation, di&s;cordant to the ge|nius of the citizens, in many parts of the Union, met with con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition, which however, was gradually bani&s;hed by rea&s;on and patrioti&s;m, excepting in the four we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, where a prejudice &s;till remained, and produced &s;ym|toms of not and violence. The di&s;affection was at fir&s;t vented in general complaints&mdash; certain a&s;&s;ociations were formed to prevent the operation of the laws, and the exci&s;e of|ficers received &s;ome marks of contempt and rudene&s;s.

<P>How far in the di&s;charge of my of|ficial duties, I have been guided by the principles that they have been delinea|ted, the public records and other evi|dences

<P>In relation to the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting war in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan.

<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could ob|tain, I was well &s;atisfied that our coun|try, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intere&s;t, to take a neutral po&s;ition.

<P>The duty of holding a neutral con|duct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obligations which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>The inducements of intere&s;t for ob|&s;erving that conduct will be&s;t be refer|red to your own reflections and experi|ence.

<P>On the 7th of December, 1796, Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington delivered his la&s;t &s;peech to the repre&s;entatives of the people at the opening of the &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion of the fourth Congre&s;s, we regret that our contracted limits will not permit of in&s;erting it verbatim. In this ad|dre&s;s he communicates information re&s;pecting the mea&s;ures taken for carrying into effect treaties with the Indian nations, Great-Bri|tain, Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and Algiers. He likewi&s;e in|forms, that mea&s;ures are in operatian for ef|fecting treatics with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli. He wi&s;hes the United States to lock to the means, and to &s;et about the gradual creation of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vy; &s;o that a &s;uture
<PB N="217" REF="037222_0109_100C98A86E0C19E8">war of Europe may not find our commerce in the &s;ame unprotected &s;tate in which it was found by the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>He then proceeds to recommend the e&s;ta|blithment of certain branches of manufac|ture on public account; <HI>particularly those which are of a nature essential to the fur|nishing and equipping of the public &s;orce in time of war.</HI></P>
<P>He judiciou&s;ly, recommends the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tion of a Board of Agriculture, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro|per characters, charged with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and dif|fu&s;ing information, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, by premiums and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mall pecuniary aids, to encourag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a&s;&s;i&s;t a &s;pirit of di&s;covery and impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ment, Experience has p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ved this to be a cheap in|&s;trument of immen&s;e national benefit. He then recalis the attention of Congre&s;s, to a &s;ubject, he had before propo&s;ed to their con|&s;ideration, the expediency of e&s;tabli&s;hing a national univer&s;ity, and al&s;o a military a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|demy. He points out as monves to the in|&s;titution of a national univer&s;its, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|lation of the principles, opnions, and man|ners of our countrymen, by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter, and remarks that the more ho|mogencous our citizens can be made in the&s;e particulars, the greater will be our pro&s;pect
<PB N="218" REF="037222_0110_100C98AAF11239B0">of permanent union: and that a primary ob|ject &s;hould be the education of our youth in the &s;cience of GOVERNMENT. In a republic, what &s;pecies of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty can be more pre&s;&s;ing on its Legi&s;lature, than to pa|tronize a plan for communicating it to tho&s;e who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of a military academy, he al&s;o ob&s;erves, is recommended by cogent rea|&s;ons. However pacific, &s;ays he, the general policy of a nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate &s;tock of military knowledge, for emergencies.</P>
<P>The following important paragraph is ver|batim, "The compen&s;ations to the officers of the United States, in various in&s;tance, and in none more than in re&s;pect to the mo&s;t im|portant &s;tations, appear to call for legi&s;lative revi&s;ion. The con&s;equences of a defective provi&s;ion are of &s;erious import to the govern|ment. If private wealth is to &s;upply the defect of public contribution, it will greatly contract the &s;phere, within which the &s;elec|tion of character for office is to be made, and will proportionably dimini&s;h the probability of a choice of men able, as well as upright. Be&s;ides, that it would be repugnant to the
<PB N="219" REF="037222_0110_100C98AAF11239B0">vital principles of our government, virtually to exclude from public tru&s;ts, talents and vir|tue, unle&s;s accompanied by wealth".</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident then expre&s;&s;es his regret at the unplea&s;ant circum&s;tances which have oc|curred relative to the French republic; his ardent wi&s;h being to maintain cordial harmo|ny, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the rights and honour of our country.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives he informed, that the revenues of the United States conti|nue in a &s;tate of progre&s;&s;ive improvement: and are invited to take &s;uch further mea&s;ures as will a&s;certain, to our country, the &s;peedy extingui&s;hment of the public debt.</P>
<P>He then concluded his addre&s;s to both hou&s;es of congre&s;s, in the following words, "My &s;olicitude to &s;ee the militia of the Uni|ted States placed on an efficient e&s;tabli&s;hment, has been &s;o often and &s;o ardently expre&s;&s;ed, that I &s;hall but barely recall the &s;ubject to your view, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; at the &s;ame time, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to your enquiry, whether our harbours are yet &s;ufficiently &s;e|cured".</P>
<P>"The &s;ituation in which I now &s;tand, for the la&s;t time, in the mid&s;t of the repre&s;enta|tives of the people of the United States, na|turally recalls the period, when the admini&s;|tration

The la&s;t official act of <HI>President Washing|ton,</HI> is a letter to the Secretary of State, da|ted March 3, 1797. It re&s;pects certain for|ged letters, which were publi&s;hed in the years 1777 and 1796, and obtruded on the public as his. They were publi&s;hed at the two mo&s;t critical periods of his life, with the view of &s;triking at the integrity of his mo|tives, of wounding his character, and of de|ceiving the people. At the conclu&s;ion, there|fore of his public employments, he deemed it a duty which he owed to him&s;elf, to his coun|try, and to truth, to detail the circum&s;tances, and &s;olemnly to declare, that the letters (the dates of which he recites) are a ba&s;e forgery, were never written by him, and that he never &s;aw or heard of them, until they appeared in print. During the period in which he held the &s;upreme command of the army, and his civil admini&s;tration, the purity of his own mind prevented him from contradicting the fal&s;|hood by any public declaration, but upon his retiring to private life, and not knowing how &s;oon a more &s;erious event might take place, he made this public declaration, and reque&s;t|ed that it might be depo&s;ited in the office of the department of &s;tate, as a te&s;timony of the truth to the pre&s;ent generation and to po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="037222_0112_100C98AEDF636298">
On the and of March, 1797, General Wa&s;hington took farewell of all public em|ployment, and lo&s;t Philadelphia for his e&s;mte at Mount Vernon; in every town through which he pa&s;&s;ed on his way, he received the grateful and affectionate addre&s;&s;es, which were, &s;o ju&s;tly due to his merits from an etlighten|ed and grateful people.</P>
<P>Having thus amply de&s;eribed the <HI>august Washington</HI> in his, public character and offi|cial capacity, &s;uffer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for a moment to fol|low him in private, and take a view of him in the character of a plain citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n in his ru|ral re&s;idence at Mount Vernon.</P>
<P>The virt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous &s;implicity which di&s;tingui&s;hed the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> life of General Wa&s;hington, tho'|le&s;s known than the dazzling &s;plendor of his military activements, is not le&s;s edi&s;ying in example, or worthy the attention of his coun|trymen. The con&s;picuous character he has acted on the theatre of human affair, the uni|form dignity with which he &s;u&s;tained his part amid&s;t difficuties of the mo&s;t di&s;cour aging na|ture, and the glory of having arrived through them at the hour of triumph, have made many official and literary per&s;ons, on both &s;ides of the ocean, ambitious of a corre&s;pon|dence with him. The&s;e corre&s;pondencies unavoidably engro&s;&s;ed a great, portion of his
<PB N="223" REF="037222_0112_100C98AEDF636298">time; and the communications contained in them, comb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed with the numerous period|ical publications and news-papers which he peru&s;ed, rendered him as it were, the <HI>focus of political intelligence for the new world.</HI> Nor were his conver&s;ations with well informed men le&s;s conducive to bring him acquainted with the various events which happened in the different countries of the globe. Every foreigner of di&s;tinction who travelled in America made it a point to vi&s;it him. Mem|bers of Congre&s;s and other dignified per&s;on|ages did not pa&s;s his hou&s;e without calling to pay their re&s;pects. As another &s;ource of information it may be mentioned, that many literary productions were &s;ent to him annual|ly by their authors in Europe; and that there is &s;carcely one work written in America on any art, &s;cience, or &s;ubject, which did not &s;eek his protection, or which was not offered to him as a token of gratitude. Mechanical inventions were frequently &s;ubmitted to him for his approbation, and natural curio&s;ities pre&s;ented to him for his inve&s;tigation. But the multiplicity of epi&s;tolary applications, often on the remains of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which happened when he was in office, &s;ometimes on &s;ubjects foreign to his &s;ituation, frivolous in their nature, and intended merely to gratify
<PB N="224" REF="037222_0113_100C98B07A841658">the vanity of the writers by drawing an&s;wers from him, were truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and almo&s;t incredible. His benignity in an&s;wering, per|haps increa&s;ed the number. Did he not hu&s;|band every moment to the be&s;t advantage, it would not have been in his power to notice the va&s;t variety of &s;ubjects that claimed his attention.</P>
<P>In his manner of living he was extremely regular, temperate and indu&s;trious. He ro&s;e winter and &s;ummer at the dawn of day, ge|nerally read or wrote &s;ometime before break|fa&s;t: breakfa&s;ted about &s;even o'clock on In|dian hoe-cake and tea, and often rode imme|diately to his different farms, and remained with his labourers till a little after two o'clock, when he returned; at three he di|ned, commonly on a &s;ingle di&s;h, and drank from half a pint to a pint of Madeira wine, this, with one &s;mall di&s;h of tea which he took half an hour before the &s;etting of the &s;un, con&s;tituted his whole &s;u&s;tenance till the next day. His table, however, was always furni&s;hed with elegance and exuberance, but was void of pomp: and whether he had com|pany or not, he remained an hour at table in familiar conver&s;ation.&mdash;His temper was of a &s;erious ca&s;t, and his countenance carried the impre&s;&s;ion of thoughtfulne&s;s; yet he perfect|ly

After dinner he applied him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s and about nine retired to re&s;t; but when he had company he politely attended upon them till they wi&s;hed to withdraw.&mdash;Agriculture was his favourite employment, he made ob&s;erva|tions on the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uce of lands, and endea|voured to throw new light upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the farmer; linen and woolen cloaths were manufactured under his roof, and order and economy were e&s;tabli&s;hed in all his de|partments both within and without doors.&mdash; Mrs. Wa&s;hington pre&s;ided over the whole, and united to the qualities of an excellent farmer's wife, that &s;imple dignity which ought to characteri&s;e a woman who&s;e hu&s;band has acted &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part on the public theatre.&mdash;Such is the hi&s;tory of the private life of this great character.</P>
<P>In 1798, the unparalleled treatment which the American mini&s;ters received at Paris from the republic of France, left little ground to hope for any amicable accommodation with that republic, in con&s;equence of which, the military forces of the United States were greatly augmented, and the Pre&s;ident, with the advice of the Senate, appointed <HI>George Washington, Lieutenant General and

<P>He held this command, and contributed his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the arrange|ment and organization of the army until the 14th of December, 1799, when it plea&s;ed

<P>"Before Dr. Craik arrived at Mount Vernon, the General had been bled by one of his over|&s;eers.

<P>"As his re&s;piration became difficult, he &s;aid calmly, "<HI>doctors, I die hard</HI>" But not|with&s;tanding the excrutiating agonies of his violent di&s;ea&s;e, he tranquilly a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions during the evening. About fifteen minutes before he died (which was between 11 and 12 o'clock, on Saturday night, the 14th of December) he &s;aid to Doctor Craik "<HI>doctor, what is the clock? how long am I to continue in this situation?</HI>" The doctor an|&s;wered,

<P>His body was entombed, with &s;olemn ho|nours and funeral pomp, in the family vault, upon the e&s;tate of Mount Vernon, attended by the clergy, military, ma&s;onic brethren, and a numerous concour&s;e of citizens.</P>
<P>The melancholy intelligence of the death of General Wa&s;hington, was every where re|ceived throughout the United States, with &s;en&s;ations of &s;orrow and regret; the hou&s;es of Congre&s;s for a period adjourned; they condoled with the Pre&s;ident of the United States, on the lo&s;s our country had &s;u&s;tained in the death of her worthie&s;t citizen, they went into mourning, and reque&s;ted the Pre|&s;ident

<P>Orders were i&s;&s;ued by the direction of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, announcing to the army the death of its <HI>beloved chief,</HI> and reque&s;ted the military honours therein, &s;pe|cifying to be paid at the &s;everal &s;tations of the army.</P>
<P>The Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, enacted "that a mar|ble monument be erected in the capitol in the city of Wa&s;hington, to the memory of Gen. Wa&s;hington; and that his family be reque&s;ted to permit his body to be depo&s;ited under it&mdash; and that the monument be &s;o de&s;igned as to commemorate the great military and political events of his life. That there be a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, and a public oration delivered on the occa&s;ion. To the above re&s;olution Mrs. Wa&s;hington a&s;&s;ented, &s;acrifing her private wi&s;hes and individual feelings to the public
<PB N="230" REF="037222_0116_100C98B753E89690">will. The public proce&s;&s;ion took place in Philadelphia on thur&s;day December the 26th, the ceremony was judiciou&s;ly conducted; per|haps there never was a greater di&s;play of public mourning, &s;olemnity and re&s;pect, ex|hibited in the we&s;tern hemi&s;phere; the ar|rangements united every de&s;cription of pub|lic and private character, civil and military; the funeral &s;ervice, adapted with great felici|ty to the occa&s;ion, was pronounced by Bi&s;hop White, the decea&s;ed being of the epi&s;copal church, after which, General Lee, who was appointed by Congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e, de|livered the funeral oration&mdash;we &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at|tempt a report of this admirable eulogium, of which the public are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, con|vinced that it would &s;uffer by the attempt.</P>
<P>Having pur&s;ued this di&s;tingui&s;hed man throughout his public life and in his private retreat, it only now remains that we de&s;cribe his per&s;on, which bears a very great analogy to the qualifications of his mind.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington was a tall well made man, rather large boned, and had a tolerable genteel addre&s;s: his features were manly and bold, his eyes of a blui&s;h ca&s;t and very lively; his hair a deep brown, his face rather long and marked with the &s;mall pox; his com|plexion &s;un burnt and without much colour,
<PB N="231" REF="037222_0116_100C98B753E89690">and his countenance &s;en&s;ible, compo&s;ed, and thoughtful; there was a remarkable air of dignity about him, with a &s;triking degree of gracefulne&s;s: He had an excellent under|&s;tanding without much quickne&s;s; was &s;trict|ly ju&s;t, vigilant, and generous; an affection|ate hu&s;band, a faithful friend, a father to the de&s;erving; gentle in his manners, in temper rather re&s;erved; a total &s;tranger to religious prejudices, which have &s;o often excited Chri&s;|tians of one denomination to cut the throats of tho&s;e of another; in his morals irre|proachable; he was never known to exceed the bounds of the mo&s;t rigid temperance: in a word, all his friends and acquaintance univer&s;ally allow that no man ever united in his own per&s;on, a more perfect alliance of the virtues of a philo&s;opher with the talents of a &s;tate&s;man and a general. Condour, &s;incerity, affability and &s;implicity &s;eem to have been the &s;triking features of his character. The be&s;t portraits ever taken of him, are tho&s;e paint|ed by the ingenious Mr. Stewart of German|town, and the be&s;t engraving is the large me|zotinto done by Mr. Savage of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Such is the life and character of the man to whom America intru&s;ted her important cau&s;e, and &s;he has had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her choice; and mo&s;t ungrateful would

<P>Mo&s;t nations have been favoured with &s;ome patriotic deliverer&mdash;The I&s;raelites had their Mo&s;es; Rome had her Camillus; Greece her Leonidas; Sweden her Gu&s;tavus; and Eng|land her Hampdens, her Ru&s;&s;els, and her Sydneys&mdash;but the&s;e illu&s;trious heroes, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful in pre&s;erving and defending, did not, like <HI>Washington,</HI> form or e&s;tabli&s;h em|pires, which will, in all probability, be the refuge or a&s;ylum of virtue, bani&s;hed from Europe by luxury and corruption.</P>
