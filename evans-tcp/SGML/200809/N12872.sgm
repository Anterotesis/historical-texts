<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE of late been entertained with &s;trange things from the pulpit, which have cau&s;ed no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s in my mind, with regard to the e&s;&s;entials of the Go&s;pel, le&s;t they &s;hould be brought down, and rendered palatable to the pride of the carnal heart.</P>
<P>For, in my apprehen&s;ion, tho&s;e &s;crip|tural doctrines, which &s;erve to exalt the &s;aviour and aba&s;e the creature, &s;uch as the depravity of the human nature, and the rich, free, &s;overeign grace of God, in the recovery of lo&s;t &s;inners to him|&s;elf, by faith in the imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, are evidently &s;truck at.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k an an&s;wer to that all-important que&s;tion&mdash;"What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved." <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 30.</P>
<P>I the rather make this enquiry, as I have lately been taught the following doctrines, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That men in a natural unregene|rate &s;tate, can do tho&s;e things which are well-plea&s;ing and acceptable in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="016276_0004_0F9BD1B908F45FA8">2. That the &s;pecial, effacacious in|fluences of the Holy Spirit in conver&s;ion are unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="3">3. Which a&s;&s;erts an unregenerate man has as much power or ability to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly Canaan, as I&s;rael had to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earthly Canaan.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some, &s;aith the preacher, hold to an ab&s;olute, per&s;onal, unconditional e|lection, which (adds he) is ab&s;urd and ridiculous, and ble&s;&s;ed be God, it is fal&s;e doctrine: For Chri&s;t did as much for Judas as for St. Paul.</P>
<P N="5">5. I am told that the power of the will, though an Arminian tenet, is a good one; that every mans has power within him&s;elf, from means and motives held up, &s;avingly to chu&s;e or refu&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. That if I repent and believe the Go&s;pel, God has engaged that he will give me a new heart and would cau&s;e me to walk in his &s;tatutes; and if I do not God will break his covenant. As in Deuteronomy.</P>
<P>From the apo&s;tle's mentioning the breaking off of the Jews, and grafting in of the Gentiles, I am told, that the
<PB N="5" REF="016276_0005_0F9BD1BA5E5D5C78">
former di&s;pen&s;ation was a faith of pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation means no more, el&s;e the apo&s;tle's rea|&s;oning is fooli&s;hne&s;s. Con&s;equently tells me that &s;aving grace is unnece&s;&s;ary for complying with any ordinance.</P>
<P N="8">8. I am taught that creeds, catechi&s;ms, confe&s;&s;ions of &s;aith, church covenants, &amp;c. are a long rope of which the devil has the knot-end. That the devil could not have done &s;o much mi&s;chief without them, and that there could not be a re|formation till the&s;e were thrown a&s;ide. But then he added, that children might be taught the catechi&s;e, provided the mo&s;t dangerous parts were left out.</P>
<P N="9">9. I am told on account of the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t the divine attributes harmoni&s;e, ju&s;tice could demand no more: Chri&s;t partaking human nature his elevated and re&s;tored it to favour; and the whole human race are upon bet|ter &s;tanding than Adam in innocency.</P>
<P N="10">10. The go&s;pel is a remedial law, brought down to our capacities, and that we are able to obey its precepts.</P>
<P N="11">11. The depravity of human nature is denied, and original &s;in is a&s;&s;erted not to be damning.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="6" REF="016276_0006_0F9BD1BB0BA64108">12. I have been taught that original &s;in and imputed guilt is as un&s;criptural as the Indian's philo&s;ophy was unphilo|&s;ophical, when he &s;aid, the world was held up by a great Indian, the Indian &s;tood upon a tortoi&s;e and the tortoi&s;e &s;tood upon nothing.</P>
<P N="13">13. That an unregenerate man could act a divine faith, or put forth a &s;aving act, as well as the regenerate.</P>
<P N="14">14. I am taught that a &s;aying &s;aith is an a&s;&s;ent of the will, founded on the under&s;tanding, but the con&s;ent of the will was no part of it, illu&s;trated by this &s;imilitude, '<HI>I believe there is &s;uch a place as London, becau&s;e I have &s;een the hi&s;tory of it.</HI>' And the life of faith is works: And that God is not the immediate au|thor of faith, but the &s;criptures mediately or by means. And the faith of devils differs not from the faith of believers, but in this, one has works, the other has none.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the doctrines I have been taught to believe; pray be &s;o kind as to give me, in brief, your &s;entiments upon them, and you will greatly oblige one, who is <HI>&s;earching after Truth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The <HI>REPLY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your addre&s;s you di&s;cover a de|&s;ire to be freed turn error, and to be led into the knowledge of divine truth.</P>
<P>It will afford me peculiar plea&s;ure, if I may be happily in&s;trumental, in the hand of God, of affording you &s;ome little a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this mo&s;t weighty concern.</P>
<P>Your fir&s;t enquiry is, '<HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI>' I would direct you to the apo&s;tle's an&s;wer, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> Not that any per&s;on if left to the inclinations of his own depraved heart, will ever feel a di&s;po&s;ition &s;avingly to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t. <HI>Becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God.</HI> Rom. viii. 7. <HI>For by grace are ye &s;aved through faith, and that not of your|&s;elves, it is the gift of God.</HI> Eph. ii. 8.</P>
<P>Man is not born a believer, faith &s;prings not up of it&s;elf, from &s;ome hidden &s;eeds in our degenerate nature; but is altoge|ther of a foreign extract, it is of a &s;u|pernatural birth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016276_0008_0F9BD1BCEF448660">None that give credit to the Bible, of even con&s;ult their own experience and ob&s;ervation, but mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this grace of faith is a holy principle, which no man brings into the world with him, for we are born with an evil heart with|in us; are all included in the number of the many, who by <HI>one man's di&s;obe|dience were made &s;inners.</HI> There is an inbred principle of infidelity, an hidden root of bitterne&s;s, in the corrupt nature, which we have all derived from apo&s;|tate Adam. Fooli&s;hne&s;s, &s;ays the wi&s;e|e&s;t man, is bound up in the heart of a child, and nothing can effectually root it out, but the <HI>rod of his &s;trength, who maketh his people willing in the day of his power.</HI></P>
<P>Unrenewed men are as much at en|mity in their minds, again&s;t the grace of God, and the merits of Chri&s;t, in the &s;cripture. account of them, as they are to his holine&s;s and moral government.</P>
<P>This appears evident in convicted per&s;ons, when enlightened by the holy &s;pirit, they &s;ee them&s;elves under a brok|en law, and in extreme danger of peri&s;h|ing forever, without an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t,
<PB N="9" REF="016276_0009_0F9BD1BF54349B80">
a new heart, and a change from nature to grace: Yet how great is their attach|ment to the law as a covenant of works, how does the &s;pirit of the phari&s;ee ope|rate and prevail within them! That however much they may expre&s;s their de&s;ire toward a &s;aviour, and a willingne&s;s to be ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t; it is plain they are for compounding matters, mingling law and go&s;pel, or el&s;e pa&s;s on in a mid|dle way between them: At be&s;t they are for wa&s;hing their &s;ins by the tears of repentance, joined with faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, or el&s;e hope to make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their prayers and duties, thinking by the&s;e to recommend them|&s;elves to the grace of God, to obtain Chri&s;t, and get entitled to his benefits: At mo&s;t the pride of their &s;tubborn hearts will not &s;uffer them to come to Chri&s;t as naked forlorn &s;inners, wretched and mi&s;erable, trembling under fearful apprehen&s;ions of their guilt and danger, as worthle&s;s, helple&s;s and hopele&s;s in them&s;elves con&s;idered, depending alone on the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t for ju&s;tification and acceptance with God.</P>
<P>Hence it is manife&s;t, that holy and
<PB N="10" REF="016276_0010_0F9BD1BF87866C10">
unfeigned faith, is &s;o far from being a connatural principle in us, that by nature we are utter &s;trangers to it, nay enemies again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;aith an acquired habit or the natural effect of human endeavours, which we procure to our&s;elves, by vir|tue of our own more improvements on natural rea&s;on and con&s;cience: For the truly regenerate are <HI>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man but of God.</HI> John i, 13.</P>
<P>And when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to bring you &s;avingly to believe in Chri&s;t, he will give you to &s;ee that &s;alvation is all of grace, of pure, unmingled grace, that all boa&s;ting may be excluded from man, and all the glory redound to his great name. That the law is &s;piritual, but that you are carnal, &s;old under &s;in He will &s;hew you that all works produced by human endeavours and even faith it&s;elf, as it is the act of the creature, are en|tirely &s;et a&s;ide in the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of our ju&s;tification before God; and that you &s;tand in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute need of a better righteousne&s;s than your own even the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to denominate you righteous before his en|lightened
<PB N="11" REF="016276_0011_0F9BD1C51D26F3A0">
tribunal. That nothing &s;hort of an almighty power can take away the &s;tony heart, and effectually renew the will. He will then hold up a &s;aviour to view, &s;uch a &s;aviour as is exactly calcu|lated to relieve you under your peri&s;h|ing circum&s;tances; and will enable you to hunger and thir&s;t after Chri&s;t: He will give you to &s;ee that in Je&s;us the Redeemer all fulne&s;s dwells; all fulne&s;s of merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s, of grace, &s;anc|tification and &s;alvation; and this for the unworthy, for the mo&s;t guilty among men, for <HI>who&s;oever will,</HI> even for the chief of &s;inners.</P>
<P>If you know the&s;e things by happy experience, may you &s;til go on <HI>rejoicing in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, putting no confidence in the Fle&s;h.</HI> But if not, may the Lord give you a will, a heart, cordially to accept of Chri&s;t; may he make bear his arm, and by the powerful operations of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, effectually draw off your affections from the love of &s;in, from the love of the world, and the things of it; may he draw you to him&s;elf, and &s;aving|ly unite you to Je&s;us Chri&s;t by a faith of divine operation; that you may live to God, honour his great name, and bring
<PB N="12" REF="016276_0012_0F9BD1C78DAF3068">
forth much fruit to the prai&s;e of his glo|rious grace, that hereafter you may join with &s;aints and angels in &s;ublime a&s;crip|tions of prai&s;e to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the lamb forever and ever.</P>
<P>As to the doctrines you have been taught, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. "That men in a natural, unrege|nerate &s;tate, can do tho&s;e things which are well-plea&s;ing and acceptable in the &s;ight of God."</P>
<P>This appears to me both <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>un&s;criptural.</HI> 1. Dangerous for it leads the &s;inner to build his hopes for heaven on a fal&s;e foundation, even upon his own works: But what &s;ay the &s;crip|tures, <HI>Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 11. <HI>By grace are ye &s;aved; not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI> Eph. ii. 8, 9. Now if Je&s;us Chri&s;t be the only foundation for men to build the &s;alvation of their precious &s;ouls upon, then to build upon works as a foundation mu&s;t be infinitely dangerous. 2. It is <HI>un&s;criptural</HI>; for, &s;ays Chri&s;t, John iii. 6. <HI>that which is born of Fle&s;h, is Fle&s;h.</HI> And &s;ays the apo&s;tle, Rom. viii. 8. <HI>They that
<PB N="13" REF="016276_0013_0F9BD1C8B623F088">
are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> By being in the fle&s;h, mu&s;t mean man in his natural unregenerate &s;tate, for being born of the fle&s;h is directly oppo&s;ed by our Saviour him&s;elf to being born of the &s;pirit: He therefore adds, <HI>Marvel not that I &s;aid unto thee, ye mu&s;t be born again.</HI> We read expre&s;sly, Heb. xi. 6. <HI>That without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> But man in his natural &s;tate has not faith, therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible for man in his natural &s;tate to do tho&s;e things which are well plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. "That regeneration, and the &s;pecial effacacious influences of the holy &s;pirit in conver&s;ion are unnece&s;&s;ary."</P>
<P>The former part of this article is di|ametrically oppo&s;ite our &s;aviour's con|ference with Nicodemus, and to the im|port of the whole New-Te&s;tament and is therefore fal&s;e. And as to the &s;pecial, effacacious influences of the holy &s;pirit in conver&s;ion as unnece&s;&s;ary, the&s;e texts may prove the a&s;&s;ertion un&s;criptural, Eph. i. 19, 20. <HI>And what is the exceed|ing greatne&s;s of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chri&s;t, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="016276_0014_0F9BD1C94F050820">
2 Cor. v. 17. Therefore <HI>if any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature.</HI> With Eph. ii. 1.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. "Which a&s;&s;erts, an unregenerate man has as much power, or ability to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly Canaan, as I&s;|rael had to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earth|ly Canaan."</P>
<P>If by power, or ability, he means a natural power, I &s;hall not contend with him; but if he means a moral power, that men have a heart, a will, while un|regenerate, to love God, to chu&s;e his &s;er|vice, to believe in Chri&s;t, and accept of &s;alvation, as offered in the go&s;pel through him, I mu&s;t deny the a&s;&s;ertion, and hold it un&s;criptural: El&s;e why does our &s;a|viour complain, <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,</HI> John v. 40. It is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as being given unto men to believe, <HI>Philip.</HI> i. 2, 9: And &s;ays Chri&s;t, John vi. 44, <HI>No man can come to me except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. "Some, &s;ays the preacher, (I had almo&s;t &s;aid impo&s;ter) hold to an ab&s;o|lute, per&s;onal, unconditional election; which, adds he, is ab&s;urd and ridiculous, and ble&s;&s;ed be God it is fal&s;e doctrine:
<PB N="15" REF="016276_0015_0F9BD1CA09752098">
For Chri&s;t died as much for Judas as for St. Paul."</P>
<P>That there is a certain remnant that &s;hall be &s;aved, and this by virtue of e|lection is plain from the following pa&s;|&s;ages. <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;els of mercy afore prepared unto glory,</HI> Rom. ix 23. <HI>The election hath obtained,</HI> Rom. xi. 7. <HI>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,</HI> Acts xiii. 48. And 2. The&s;&s;. ii. 13. <HI>God hath from the beginning cho&s;en you to &s;alvation,</HI> &amp;c. It was requi&s;ite that election &s;hould be ab&s;olute, becau&s;e of the ab&s;olutene&s;s of God's decree touching the death of his Son, unto which he was fore-ordained unrepealably. 1. Pet. i. 20. <HI>He was the lamb &s;lain from the foundati|on of the world,</HI> Rev. xiii. 8. <HI>And it was not po&s;&s;ible that cup &s;hould pa&s;s from him,</HI> Matt xxvi. 39, 42. Now if it be a thing below the prudence of men to lay down the price, without &s;ecuring the purcha&s;e; then &s;urely the wi&s;dom of God could not determine the death of his &s;on, for men's &s;alvation, and yet leave the &s;alva|tion of the&s;e very men at an uncertain|ty; which it mu&s;t have been, if their election had not been ab&s;olute. And that election is per&s;onal, is plain from this;
<PB N="16" REF="016276_0016_0F9BD1CACEF21C60">
the de&s;ign of God in the death of Chri&s;t could not otherwi&s;e be &s;ecured. Had the de&s;ign been to purcha&s;e &s;alvation for be|lievers, without a&s;certaining the per&s;ons that &s;hould believe, it had been uncer|tain whether <HI>any</HI> would be &s;aved, be|cau&s;e uncertain whether any would <HI>be|lieve.</HI> If <HI>certain</HI> that &s;ome would <HI>believe,</HI> this certainty mu&s;t be decreed. For no|thing future could be certain otherwi&s;e; and if it was decreed that <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;hould believe, the individuals of that &s;ome mu&s;t be decreed al&s;o; for faith is the gift of God, and could not be fore&s;een in any, but whom he had decreed to give it unto. Which laid together are a good demon&s;tration that tho&s;e Chri&s;t died for, were as well pre-ordained, as that he &s;hould die for them, and that definitely and by name.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o unconditional.</P>
<P>To derive election from any root, be|&s;ide the good plea&s;ure of God, is to fru&s;|trate the principal end of man's &s;alvation, viz, <HI>the glory of God's grace,</HI> Eph. i. 6, 2, 7. This attribute of all the re&s;t, he will not have eclip&s;ed, nor infringed upon; it is &s;o divinely &s;acred, as not to admit the lea&s;t human touch; for which very
<PB N="17" REF="016276_0017_0F9BD1D13468A040">
cau&s;e, the Lord hath &s;o contrived that ble&s;|&s;ed de&s;ign of his glory, that all boa&s;ting is excluded, <HI>and no Fle&s;h &s;hall glory in his pre|&s;ence,</HI> 1. Cor. i. 29. But if any thing in the creature, any good works fore&s;een, be en|titled to the cau&s;ality of election, fle&s;h will glory; and in&s;tead of excluding man's boa&s;ting, grace it&s;elf will be excluded. See Rom. xi. 6.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid "Chri&s;t died as much for Judas as for St. Paul:" This I deny. Judas is ac|knowledged by all, to be the &s;on of perdi|tion, and to be eternally lo&s;t: But tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died are appointed to ob|tain &s;alvation through him, 1 The&s;&s;. v. 9. Chri&s;t is &s;aid expre&s;ly to die for his people, Matt. i. 21. His &s;heep, John x. 11, 12. His church, Acts xx. 28. Eph. v. 25. As di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the world, Rom. v. 8. Whence, &s;ays one, "We may &s;urely con|clude, that Chri&s;t died not for all and eve|ry one. Not for tho&s;e he never knew, whom he hates, whom he hardens, on whom he will not &s;hew mercy, who were before of old ordained to condemnation: In a word for a reprobate, for the world for which he would not pray."</P>
<P>Here perhaps you will object, "How can the offers of &s;alvation ba &s;aid to be made
<PB N="18" REF="016276_0018_0F9BD1D1C18FD760">
with &s;incerity to tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t never died?" To this I an&s;wer in the words of a learned divine.

<P>To this it may be replied, as to unrege|nerate per&s;ons they have no will, or moral power, to chu&s;e and prefer &s;piritual and di|vine things; they de&s;ire not the knowledge of God's ways; their carnal minds are en|mity again&s;t God, and are not &s;ubject to his law, nor can they be &s;ubject to it, with|out the &s;pecial grace of God. <HI>Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power,</HI> P&s;a.

<P N="6">6. "That if I repent and believe the Go&s;pel, God has engaged that he will give me a new heart, and would cau&s;e me to walk in his &s;tatutes, and if I do not, God will break his covenant, as in <HI>Deuteronomy.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here it may be ob&s;erved, that no per&s;on does truly repent and believe in Chri&s;t, but he that has, a <HI>new heart.</HI> I hope no one will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to a&s;&s;ert, than an un|regenerate per&s;on, while &s;uch, can act &s;aving faith and evangelical repentence: No, they mu&s;t be created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t put in them fir&s;t. Hence faith and repentance are not conditions of the new heart, but the fruits and gracious exerci&s;es of it. The&s;e by the influences of his &s;pirit, God will enable to walk in his &s;tatutes, and to per&s;evere through faith and holine&s;s unto &s;alvation. <HI>For having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.</HI> John xiii. 1.

<P>We may here ob&s;erve, that no di&s;pen|&s;ation, ever given from God to men admits of hypocri&s;y; he always requires the heart, and even under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, tho&s;e that were ceremonially polluted, were forbidden to partake of the pa&s;&s;over, not|with&s;tanding their profe&s;&s;ion, And under the holy di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, the church of Chri&s;t is called a &s;piritual hou&s;e, and believers are &s;aid to be lively &s;tones of which it is built, an holy prie&s;t had to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 5. But what unfit materials, are hypocritical pro|fe&s;&s;ors, who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, to make up a part of this &s;piritual building? The go&s;pel therefore requires holine&s;s of heart and life in all tho&s;e that make profe&s;|&s;ion of their faith in Chri&s;t. <HI>And let every one, that nameth the name of Chri&s;t depart from iniquity,</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 19. <HI>God is a &s;pirit and they who wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth,</HI> John iv. 24.</P>

As to their being a long rope, &amp;c. I think it a very indecent and unju&s;tifiable expre&s;&s;ion. And as to there being no reformation till the&s;e are thrown a&s;ide; this we know, there have been glorious out-pourings of the &s;pirit in the churches where the&s;e have been care|fully attended to, and we hope for &s;till greater. <HI>Hold fa&s;t therefore the form of &s;ound words.</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12.</P>

ab&s;urd: In order to act faith there mu&s;t be the principle: for what &s;ays our &s;aviour, <HI>Fir&s;t make the tree good, then the fruit will be good; for a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14.

<P>According to this, an hi&s;torical faith, or the faith of a&s;&s;ent, is &s;aving.

This faith will work by love and purify the heart; and any thing &s;hort of this is but a dead faith: <HI>To them that believe Chri&s;t is precious,</HI> but to thou&s;ands that give their a&s;&s;ent to the Bible as true, he is not precious: 'They &s;ee neither form nor comline&s;s in him, why they &s;hould de&s;ire him:' <HI>But to as many as receive him, to them he gives power to be|come the &s;ons of God, even to as many as be|lieve on his name,</HI> John i. 12. And have not the&s;e the faith of con&s;ent think you? He adds, "the life of faith is works." I an&s;wer, no; good works, or holine&s;s, are the nece&s;&s;ary effects of a &s;aving faith; but Chri&s;t is the life of faith, hence he is called the <HI>believer's life.</HI> He is the grand object of faith; hence, &s;ays he, <HI>Ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me.</HI></P>
<P>God is the immediate author of faith; <HI>Faith is the gift of God,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, and though faith comes by hearing, yet barely hearing or attending on the means, does not produce faith, this is the &s;pecial and immediate work of the &s;pirit of God upon the &s;oul, hence we read of Lydia, "who&s;e heart the Lord," not men nor means, "opened." Notwith&s;tanding it is the duty of all to attend upon the means,
<PB N="27" REF="016276_0027_0F9BD1E0333BC0D0">
for in this way God ordinarily communi|cates this &s;pecial grace: In the di&s;po&s;als of &s;aving faith he acts as &s;overeign, he gives it to whom he will and is under no obliga|tions, but his more good plea&s;ure to be&s;tow it upon any.

<P>THE Council was opened by the Moderator with prayer. A Com|mittee from the church in New-Braintree waited upon the Coun|cil, informing them, that &s;ome per&s;on had matters of grievance, which they were de&s;irous of laying before the council. It was re&s;olved to give them an hearing forthwith. The aggrieved accordingly appeared, and exhibited a paper, in which they, in general, repre&s;ented Mr. <HI>Daniel Fo&s;ter,</HI> Pa&s;tor elect of New-Braintree, as holding &s;ome principles in his public di&s;cour&s;es, and private conver&s;ation, which are not agreeable to truth, and of a dangerous tendency. The complainants having no par|ticular articles of charge, committed to writing, were directed by the Council to withdraw, and commit to writing, what were particular matters of grievance; which having done, they laid the paper before the council, and &s;erved Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> with a copy. The Council then adjourn|ed to Wedne&s;day morning 7 o'clock.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, October</HI> 28. The council met according to adjournment. The aggrieved and Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> then appeared before the Council. The articles of grievance were then read, and Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter's</HI> an&s;wer to them; and both parties were fully heard.</P>
<P><HI>The Articles of Grievance, were as follows,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. None will ever be excluded happine&s;s, but tho&s;e that exclude them&s;elves as moral agents, infants included, the rea&s;on he gave, becau&s;e where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound; and it was not ra|tional to think, that God would make a world, and then let the Devil run away with it.</P>
<P N="2">2. In denying election, and in &s;aying that Chri&s;t died as much for Ju|das as for St. Paul.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no enmity in man naturally again&s;t God.</P>

<P>Moreover, they charge me with &s;aying as in the 5th article. In an|&s;wer to which, I &s;uppo&s;e he may act faith with divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, equal|ly with the greate&s;t &s;aint; neither can act without it.&mdash;If the&s;e brief re|plies are not &s;atisfactory I crave the liberty of enlargement, before the venerable Council, as I have here no proper time to reply in a formal manner.</P>

<P>The Council then proceeded to con&s;ider by them&s;elves, the articles of charge, article by article.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t article of charge, it was <HI>voted,</HI> that it ought not to be any bar in the way of the Council's proceeding to ordination.</P>

Mr. <HI>Fo&s;|ter</HI> explained him&s;elf, and mentioned what he meant, by "Chri&s;t dying as much for Judas as for St. Paul." He &s;aid Chri&s;t by his death, put all men into a &s;alvable &s;tate, &s;o that the offers of &s;alvation were with &s;incerity made to Judas, as well as to Paul and others, and that the rea|&s;on why Judas was not &s;aved as well as others, was, that he wilfully re|jected Chri&s;t, and would not come to him that he might have life.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I rather conceive Judas believed not, becau&s;e he was not one of Chri&s;t's &s;heep. See <HI>John. x. 26,</HI></NOTE> <HI>Voted,</HI> that this article as explained, is no ju&s;t bar in the way of the Council going on to ordain Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>As to the third article, viz. That "there is no enmity in man natu|rally again&s;t God." Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> fully denied this as a&s;&s;erted; and then proceeded to &s;ay, "That the natural man had framed in his mind an unju&s;t repre&s;entation of the moral character of God, and being con&s;cious
<PB N="31" REF="016276_0031_0F9BD1E522EA2FC8">
he had broke God's law, and that ju&s;tice was armed again&s;t him, and was bound to puni&s;h him, he therefore hated God; but that his enmity again&s;t God was not pointed again&s;t his true or whole character, but a|gain&s;t his character as <HI>law-giver</HI> and <HI>judge</HI>; and that the holy &s;pirit of God, in regeneration, removes from the mind the&s;e fal&s;e apprehen&s;ions of God's character, by which means the &s;inner is brought to love God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot but look upon this as a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">king piece <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> divinity, and if no bar to ordination, really I dont know what might be termed one.</NOTE> <HI>Voted,</HI> That this is no bar in the way of proceeding to ordination.</P>
<P>As to the fourth article, in which Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> is charged with &s;aying in private, that "original &s;in is not damning." Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> allowed that all &s;in, in its own nature is damning, and that the rea&s;on why original &s;in is not damning, is becau&s;e of the mediation of Chri&s;t and an intere&s;t therein, and that men are not delivered from the condemnation of &s;in, whether original or actual, till they are &s;avingly intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t. <HI>Voted,</HI> that this article of charge as explained by Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> is not only no bar again&s;t his ordination, but &s;ound divinity.</P>
<P>As to the fifth article, in which the pa&s;tor elect is charged with &s;ay|ing in &s;ome performance, that an unregenerate man can act a divine faith, or put forth a &s;aving act, as well as the regenerate: He an&s;wers, "I &s;uppo&s;e he may act faith, equally with the greate&s;t &s;aint; and that neither can act it without." He adds, "That no one ever acted faith, previous to &s;ome real, &s;piritual change: That his de&s;ign in the perform|ance referred to, is no more than this, that we have an entire depen|dence upon God, and that we are not &s;ufficient of our&s;elves to do any thing &s;piritually good, without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance." <HI>Voted,</HI> that this fifth article is no bar again&s;t proceeding to ordination.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t article, in which the pa&s;tor elect is charged with &s;aying, in the funeral &s;ermon of Madam <HI>Ruggles</HI> decea&s;ed, "That it would not be a&s;ked in the great day, how we believed, but how we obeyed." Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> objected again&s;t the legality of the charge, as he had not been &s;erv|ed with a copy of it: However, upon its being moved that on the whole, it might be be&s;t, he con&s;ented to &s;ay &s;omething to it. He granted readily, "That the righteou&s;ne&s;s and merits of Chri&s;t, was the &s;ole ground of a &s;inner's ju&s;tification: And that where good men are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified in the great day by their works, &s;uch works had faith in Chri&s;t as their principle." <HI>Voted,</HI> That the explanation above is &s;a|tisfactory to the Council.</P>
<P>The council then proceeded, to examine the pa&s;tor elect, as to his &s;en|timents upon the mo&s;t important points of religion, and the motives that influenced him to undertake the mini&s;try; and they voted their &s;a|tisfaction upon the&s;e heads.</P>
<P>It was then voted by the council, that the way is clear to proceed to the ordination of the pa&s;tor elect. The following mini&s;ters were appoint|ed to the en&s;uing &s;ervices, viz. Rev. <HI>Dan Fo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> to make the fir&s;t prayer: Rev. Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> to make the prayer before the charge; Rev. Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to give the charge; Rev. Mr. <HI>Dana</HI> to make the prayer after the charge; and Rev. Mr. <HI>Fi&s;k</HI> to give the right hand of fellow&s;hip.</P>
