<HEAD>TO THE <HI>New-England</HI> Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_UPON my &s;earching for Materials for our Chronology, the <HI>following Piece</HI> with others coming to hand; I cannot but think it worthy of the pub|lick View. Not that I &s;uppo&s;e it will plea&s;e the Eye of the politer World: But becau&s;e it gives a &s;trong and lively Image of the extraordinary pious Spirit and De&s;ign of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h People,</HI> who fir&s;t came over and dwelt in this <HI>Indian Wilderne&s;s;</HI> and in every &s;erious Mind cannot but rai&s;e a Veneration for them, and a Plea|&s;ure to review their bright Examples.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> was One among them; an Eye-witne&s;s of the things he writes of; and by the publick and continued E&s;teem his Country paid him in his Day, his Te&s;timony comes with Power upon us; and the Style &s;o plain and natural, that in the Reading, it &s;eems as if we came over with Him, and were living in tho&s;e pious Times.</P>
<P>He &s;hows the mighty Spirit of Love to GOD and Zeal for his <HI>in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip</HI> that mov'd &amp; wrought in our Predece&s;&s;ors: How heavenly-minded, how humble, and how contented under all the Straits and Difficulties of a new Plantation, at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from any humane Succour.</P>
<P>He was de&s;irous that GOD &s;hould have the Glory of his Providence, in bringing Him with &s;o many pious People into this hideous Land, in Pre|&s;erving &amp; &s;upplying them, increa&s;ing, pro&s;pering,
<PB N="ii" REF="003403_0004_1003155583A7EDA8">
and working wonderful Salvations for them. And he was greatly concerned that <HI>Po&s;terity,</HI> and e&s;pecially his own, &s;hould both <HI>know</HI> the&s;e things and <HI>walk</HI> in the good ways of their Forefathers: To this&punc; He therefore mo&s;t pathetically charges and commands them; warning them of Evil, and relating his own Experience for their Direction and Encouragement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Account &s;ubjoined</HI> is drawn by another hand: and tho't advi&s;eable to be Publi&s;hed al&s;o; that his Offspring may know the religious Ance&s;tor from whom they come, and their awful Obligations to fear and &s;erve the GOD of their Fathers.</P>
<P>And on this Occa&s;ion, I can't but recommend to our grave and pious <HI>Heads of Hou&s;holds,</HI> the u&s;e|ful Practice of <HI>Leaving in Writing</HI> their &s;olemn Charges to their Po&s;terity: That when the Pa|rents &s;peak and live no more on Earth, their Chil|dren after them may frequently review both their Examples and In&s;tructions, and pre&s;erve them bet|ter in their Minds. I can't but think that this, with the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing would be an happy Me|thod of preventing the Declen&s;ion of many Families, and of keeping alive the things that remain among us, and are ready to Die. And methinks, as every pious <HI>Father</HI> would in a lawful way de&s;ire to &s;peak to his Children after his Decea&s;e; He can do no le&s;s for the Pre&s;ervation of the Life of Religion, and for the Souls of his &s;urviving Off|&s;pring. His oral Coun&s;els are too like the Wind, which quickly pa&s;&s;es: But impre&s;s'd in written Monuments, remain to excite them every Day; and if neglected, to witne&s;s again&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>Capt. <HI>Clap's</HI> MEMOIRS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Thought good, my dear Chil|dren, to leave with you &s;ome Account of God's remarkable <HI>Providences</HI> to me, in bringing me into this Land, and placing me here among his dear Ser|vants, and in his Hou&s;e, who am mo&s;t unworthy of the lea&s;t of his Mercies. The Scripture requireth us to tell God's wondrous Works to our Children, that they may tell them to their Chil|dren, that God may have Glory throughout all Ages. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>I was Born in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Sallcom</HI> in <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> in the Year of our Lord 1609. My Father was a Man fearing God, and in good e&s;teem among God's faithful Servants: His outward E&s;tate was not great; I think not above <HI>Eighty Pounds</HI> per <HI>Annum.</HI> We were <HI>Five Brethren</HI> (of which I was the younge&s;t) and <HI>Two Si&s;ters.</HI> God was
<PB N="2" REF="003403_0006_1003155897D24FF8">
graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to breathe by his holy Spirit (I hope) in all our Hearts, if in mine; which I am not altogether without hopes of. <HI>Four</HI> of us <HI>Bre|thren</HI> lived at <HI>home</HI>: I did de&s;ire my dear Father (my dear Mother being dead) that I might live <HI>abroad,</HI> which he con&s;ented to: So I fir&s;t went for tryal to live with a worthy Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Wil|liam Southcot,</HI> who lived about <HI>Three Miles</HI> from the City of <HI>Exon.</HI> He was careful to keep a Godly Family. There being but a very mean Preacher in that Place, we went every Lord's-Day into the <HI>City,</HI> where were many famous Preachers of the Word of God. I then took &s;uch a liking unto the Revd. Mr. <HI>John Warham,</HI> that I did de&s;ire to live near him: So I removed (with my Father's Con&s;ent) into the <HI>City,</HI> and lived with one Mr. <HI>Mo&s;&s;iour,</HI> as famous a Family for Religion as ever I knew: He kept Seven or Eight Men, and divers Maid-Servants; and he had a Conference up|on a Que&s;tion propounded once a Week in his own Family: With him I Covenanted. I never &s;o much as heard of <HI>New-England</HI> until I heard of many godly Per&s;ons that were going there, and that Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> was to go al&s;o. My Ma&s;ter asked me whether I would go? I told him were I not en|gaged unto him I would willingly go: He an&s;we|red me, that &s;hould be no hindrance, I might go for him or for my &s;elf which I would. I then wrote to my Father who lived about <HI>Twelve Miles</HI> off, to Intreat his leave to go to <HI>New-Eng|land</HI>; who was &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed at fir&s;t, that he wrote me no An&s;wer, but told my Brethren that I &s;hould not go. Having no An&s;wer, I went and made my Reque&s;t to him, and God &s;o Inclined his Heart, that he never &s;aid me Nay: For now God &s;ent the Reverend Mr. <HI>Maverick,</HI> who lived <HI>Forty
<PB N="3" REF="003403_0007_10030526094F8F68">
Miles</HI> off, a Man I never &s;aw before: He having heard of me, came to my Father's Hou&s;e, and my Father agreed that I &s;hould be with him and come under his Care, which I did accordingly.</P>
<P>Mind by what I have already expre&s;&s;ed, That it was God that did draw me by his Providence out of my Father's Family, and weaned me from it by de|grees; It was God put it into my Heart to incline to Live abroad; and it was God that made my Father willing. God by his Providence brought me near Mr. <HI>Warham,</HI> and inclined my Heart to his Mini&s;try: God by his Providence moved the Heart of my Ma&s;ter <HI>Mo&s;&s;iour</HI> to ask me whether I would go to <HI>New-England</HI>: It was God by his Providence that made me willing to leave my dear Father, and dear Brethren and Si&s;ters, my dear Friends and Country: It was God that made my Father willing upon the fir&s;t Motion I made in Per&s;on, to let me go: It was God that &s;ent Mr. <HI>Maverick</HI> that pious Mini&s;ter to me, who was un|known to him, to &s;eek me out that I might come hither. So God brought me out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> the 20th of <HI>March</HI> in the Year, 1620, 30, and landed me in Health at <HI>Nantasket</HI> on the 30th of <HI>May.</HI> 1630, I being then about the Age of <HI>Twenty one</HI> Years. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God that brought me Here</HI>!</P>
<P>Now coming into this Country, I found it a vacant Wilderne&s;s, in re&s;pect of <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> There were indeed &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Solem,</HI> and &s;ome few at <HI>Charl&s;town,</HI> who were very de&s;titute when we came a&s;hore; and Planting Time be|ing pa&s;t, &s;hortly after Provi&s;ion was not to be had for Money. I wrote to my Friends, namely to my dear Father to &s;end me &s;ome Provi&s;ion, which ac|cordingly he did; and al&s;o gave order to one of his
<PB N="4" REF="003403_0008_1003155A7367AEE8">
Neighbours to &s;upply me with what I needed (he being a Seaman) who coming hither &s;upplied me with divers things. But before this Supply came, yea and after too (that being &s;pent) and the then un&s;ubdued Wilderne&s;s yielding little Food, many a Time if I could have filled my Belly, tho' with mean Victuals, it would have been &s;weet unto me. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> was a good help unto me, and others. <HI>Bread</HI> was &s;o very &s;carce, that &s;ometimes I tho't the very Cru&s;ts of my Father's Table would have been very &s;weet unto me. And when I could have <HI>Meal &amp; Water and Salt</HI> boiled together, it was &s;o good, who could wi&s;h better?</P>
<P>I took Notice of it, as a great Favour of God unto me, not only to pre&s;erve my Life, but to give me Contentedne&s;s in all the&s;e Straits; in&s;o|much that I do not remember that ever I did wi&s;h in my Heart that I had not come into this Coun|try, or wi&s;h my &s;elf back again to my Father's Hou&s;e: Yea I was &s;o far from that, that I wi&s;hed and advi&s;ed &s;ome of my dear Brethren to come hi|ther al&s;o; which accordingly <HI>one</HI> of my Brothers and tho&s;e <HI>two</HI> that married my <HI>two</HI> Si&s;ters, &s;old their Means and came hither. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;o plainly held out in the Preaching of the Go&s;pel unto poor lo&s;t Sinners, and the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and God's holy Spirit in tho&s;e Days was plea&s;ed to accompany the Word with &s;uch Efficacy upon the Hearts of many; that our Hearts were taken off from <HI>Old-England</HI> and &s;et upon <HI>Heaven.</HI> The Di&s;cour&s;e, not only of the Aged, but of the Youth al&s;o, was not, <HI>How &s;hall we go to</HI> England? (tho' &s;ome few did not only &s;o Di&s;cour&s;e, but al&s;o went back again) but <HI>How &s;hall we go to Heaven? Have I true Grace

wrought in my Heart? Have I</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>or no?</HI> O how did Men and Women, young and old, Pray for Grace, beg for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in tho&s;e Days; and it was not in vain: Many were Converted, and others e&s;tabli&s;hed in Believing: many joined unto the &s;everal Churches where they lived, confe&s;&s;ing their Faith publickly, and &s;hewing before all the A&s;&s;embly their Experiences of the Workings of God's Spirit in their Hearts to bring them to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: which many Hearers found very much Good by, to help them to try their own Hearts, and to con&s;ider how it was with them; whether any work of God's Spirit were wrought in their own Hearts or no? Oh the many Tears that have been &s;hed in <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e at &s;uch times, both by tho&s;e that have declared God's Work on their Souls, and al&s;o by tho&s;e that heard them. In tho&s;e days, <HI>God, even our own God,</HI> did <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> New-England. I find by what I heard from tho&s;e that have publickly declared what God had done for their Souls in bringing them unto <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by Faith, that God doth work divers ways upon the Hearts of Men, even as it plea&s;es him; upon &s;ome more &s;en&s;ibly, and upon others more in&s;en&s;i|bly; verifying that Text in the 3d Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> 8th Ver&s;e, <HI>The Wind bloweth where it li&s;t|eth, and thou heare&s;t the &s;ound thereof, but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> Tho' we may hear the Sound of it, that is, be &s;en&s;ible that the Spirit works, or has been at work; yet not know whence it comes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If ever there were the Work of Grace wrought &s;avingly in my Heart; the Time when, the Place where, the manner how, was never &s;o apparent unto me, as &s;ome in their Relations &s;ay it hath been unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003403_0010_100315624DD90F28">I &s;hall hint a little unto you what I have found. I remember God did long ago convince me of my Sin, (I cannot tell you how) and al&s;o of a corrupt Nature, whereby I feel my &s;elf prone to Sin. I had in my younger Days a love to Sin; and had it not been for the Fear of Hell, and of my Parents and Friends, I doubtle&s;s &s;hould have been as Vile as the wor&s;t of Men. The Care &amp; Coun|&s;el of my dear Friends, by the Re&s;training Grace of God, kept me from committing of tho&s;e hor|rid Abominations that &s;ome fell into; yet am I not thereby Ju&s;tified. I had &s;uch a love to Play with Children and Youth, that I did too often Play with them upon the Lord's-Day, if I could hide it from my dear Relatives. But God was plea&s;ed to make my Con&s;cience to be out of quiet, which made me Pray to God many Times in Secret; yet I had a Love to the Plea&s;ure of Sin, and did love to &s;ee others Play though it were on the Lord's Day. But on a Time on the Lord's-Day, when I was &s;tanding by, and &s;eeing &s;ome Youths Play, they gave me tho&s;e <HI>Points</HI> which they played for, to hold for them until their Game was out; and my Con&s;cience not being quiet, God brought that &s;aying of <HI>Saul,</HI> afterwards <HI>Paul,</HI> to my Mind, who did acknowledge that he was guilty of the Death of <HI>Stephen; for he &s;tood by, and kept the Garments of them that &s;lew him</HI>: I then put down that which I had in keeping for them, and went away; and God did help me after|wards to delight more in Them that fear'd him. I did often go to hear the Word of God preached, with my Brethren and others abroad, when we had no Preaching at home; and God inclined my Heart to love tho&s;e that fear'd him. That Text in

<P N="1">1. In former Times I do remember there was a <HI>Young Man</HI> came into the Congregation where I was, a <HI>Stranger</HI> to me, and a very hard favoured Man; I had no love to his Per&s;on; but not long after I heard, that he <HI>feared God</HI>; and upon the very Report thereof my Heart was knit unto him, altho' I never &s;pake with him that I know of.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e I find my Heart doth <HI>contemn vile Per&s;ons.</HI> I do not de&s;ire their Society: But when I am by God's Providence called to be with &s;uch, &s;o that I cannot avoid it, I &s;ay in my Heart. <HI>Wo is me that I am con&s;trained to be with &s;uch Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To this very Day if I perceive or do but hear of a Man or Women that <HI>feareth God,</HI> let him be Rich or Poor, Engli&s;h or Indian, Portugal or Ne|gro, my very Heart clo&s;eth with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e my Heart doth mo&s;t clo&s;e with, and mo&s;t highly prize tho&s;e that are mo&s;t excellent, mo&s;t holy, mo&s;t worthy In&s;truments of <HI>God's Glory</HI> and <HI>his People's Good.</HI> My earne&s;t De&s;ire and Prayer is, that God will help me to love his Graces more and more in all Men wherever the Grace of God appears to be.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003403_0012_1003156DCCBA0A98">After God had bought me into this Country, He was plea&s;ed to give me Room in the Hearts of his Servants; &s;o that I was admitted into the Church Fellow&s;hip at our fir&s;t beginning in <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> in the Year 1630. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> being clearly Prea|ched, and the way of coming to him by Believing was plainly &s;hown forth; yet becau&s;e many in their <HI>Relations</HI> &s;pake of their great Terrors and deep Sen&s;e of their lo&s;t Condition, and I could not &s;o find as others did, the Time which God wrought the Work of Conver&s;ion in my Soul, not in many re&s;pects the Manner thereof; it cau&s;ed in me much Sadne&s;s of Heart, and Doubtings how it was with me, Whether the Work of Grace were ever &s;a|vingly wrought in my Heart or no? How to ca&s;t off all Hope, to &s;ay, and verily to Believe that there was no Work of Grace wrought by God in my Heart, this I could not do; yet how to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;&s;ured thereof was my great Concern: But hearing Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> Preach out of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> that Chri&s;t's Church did come out of great Tribulation, he had &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age as this in his Sermon, <Q>That a &s;mall running Stream was much better than a great Land Flood of Water, tho' the Flood maketh the greate&s;t Noi&s;e: So, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> A little con&s;tant Stream of godly Sorrow, is better than great Horrour:</Q> God &s;pake to me by it, it was no little Support unto me.

<P>I now return to declare unto you &s;ome of the <HI>wonderful Works</HI> of God in bringing &s;o many of his faithful Servants hither into this Wilderne&s;s, and Pre&s;erving us and ours unto this Day; not|with&s;tanding our great Unworthine&s;s, and not|with&s;tanding the many A&s;&s;aults and Stratagems of Satan and his In&s;truments again&s;t God's People here. I &s;ay <HI>wonderous Works!</HI> For was it not a wonderous Work of God, to put it into the Hearts of &s;o many <HI>Worthys</HI> to agree together, when Times were &s;o bad in <HI>England,</HI> that they could not Wor|&s;hip God after the due manner pre&s;cribe in his mo&s;t holy Word, but they mu&s;t be Impri&s;oned, Excommunicated <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay that &s;o many &s;hould agree to make humble Suit unto our Sovereign Lord the KING, to grant them and &s;uch as they &s;hould approve of, a <HI>Patent</HI> of a Tract of Land in this remote Wilderne&s;s, a Place not Inhabited but by very barbarous Nations! And was it not a wonderous good Hand of God to incline the Heart of our KING &s;o freely to Grant it, with all the <HI>Priviledges</HI> which the <HI>Patent</HI> expre&s;&s;eth! And what a wonderous Work of God was it, to &s;tir up &s;uch <HI>Worthys</HI> to undertake &s;uch a difficult Work, as to remove them&s;elves and their Wives and Children, from their Native Country, and to leave their gallant Scituations there, to come into this Wilderne&s;s, to &s;et up the pure Wor&s;hip of God here! Men fit for Government in the

<HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> and in <HI>Families</HI>; and &s;ound, godly, learned Men for the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> and others that were very precious Men and Women, who came in the Year 1630. Them that came then were MAGISTRATES; Men of Renown were, Mr. <HI>Win|throp</HI> Governour, Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> Deputy Governour, Sir <HI>Richard Salton&s;tall,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ro&s;&s;i|ter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ludlow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nowel,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brad|&s;treet</HI>: Mr. <HI>Endicott</HI> came before, and others came then, be&s;ides tho&s;e named. And there came famous MINISTERS in that Year, and afterwards: as to name &s;ome; Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Warham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Marverick,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> In our low E&s;tate God did Chear our Hearts in &s;ending good and holy Men and Women, and al&s;o famous Preachers of the Word of God; as Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Weld,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bulkley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Na|thanael Rogers,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Rogers,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> Mr. <HI>Daven|port,</HI> Mr. <HI>Whiting,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cobbet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hubbard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> Mr. <HI>Flint,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>New|man,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prudden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> Mr. <HI>Huit,</HI> Mr. <HI>Street,</HI> and many others. Thus did God work won|derfully for his poor People here.</P>
<P>Then in tho&s;e Days did God manife&s;t his Pre|&s;ence among us, in converting many Souls, in gathering his dear Ones into Church-Fellow&s;hip each with other, by &s;olemn Covenants; wherein they gave up them&s;elves and their Seed to the Lord, choo&s;ing Him to be their God, who hath freely promi&s;ed &s;o to be, and to our Seed for ever, if we &amp; they do not for&s;ake him. But if any of you (dear Children) for&s;ake the Lord, tho' you were the Sons of <HI>David,</HI> he would ca&s;t you off for ever. Cleave to God, and never, never depart from
<PB N="13" REF="003403_0017_10031579ECD02718">
Him; and He will never fail you nor for&s;ake you. In tho&s;e Days great was the Tranquillity &amp; Peace of this poor Country: And there was great Love one to another: very ready to help each other; <HI>not &s;eeking their own, but every one another's Wealth.</HI> Then Sin did not &s;o openly abound a|mong us: Drunkenne&s;s, Adultery, Fornication, Oppre&s;&s;ion, and abominable Pride which now a|bounds among us, and threatens our Ruin, was then loath&s;ome almo&s;t in every ones Eyes. Then God did Ble&s;s us in the Fruits of the Earth, but e&s;pecially in &s;piritual Things; many Souls were converted to God, and very often many added to the Churches.</P>
<P>But this glorious Work of God towards his People here was &s;oon maligned by Satan; and he ca&s;t into the Minds of &s;ome corrupt Per&s;ons very erronious Opinions, which did breed great Di&s;|turbance in the Churches. And he puffed up his In&s;truments with horrible Pride, in&s;omuch that they would oppo&s;e the Truth of God delivered Publickly: and &s;ome times, yea mo&s;t times they would do it by way of Query, as if they de&s;ired to be informed: but they did indeed accu&s;e <HI>our godly Mini&s;ters</HI> of not preaching Go&s;pel, &s;aying they were <HI>Legal Preachers,</HI> but them&s;elves were for <HI>free Grace,</HI> and Mini&s;ters did Preach a <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; which was a fal&s;e A&s;per&s;ion on them. The Truth was, they would willingly have lived in Sin, and encouraged others &s;o to do, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet think to be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, becau&s;e his Grace is free; forgetting (it &s;eems) that tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t doth &s;ave from <HI>Hell,</HI> he al&s;o freely of his Grace doth &s;ave from <HI>Sin</HI>; for he <HI>came to &s;ave his People from their Sins, to give Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003403_0018_1003157D159859D0">In our beginning many were in great Straits, for want of Provi&s;ion for them&s;elves and their lit|tle Ones. Oh the <HI>Hunger</HI> that many &s;uffered, and &s;aw no hope in an Eye of Rea&s;on to be &s;up|plyed, only by <HI>Clams,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> and Fi&s;h. We did quickly build Boats, and &s;ome went a Fi&s;hing: But <HI>Bread</HI> was with many a very &s;carce thing: and <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> of all kind as &s;carce. And in tho&s;e Days, in our Straits, though I cannot &s;ay God &s;ent a <HI>Raven</HI> to feed us, as He did the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI>; yet this I can &s;ay to the I rai&s;e of God's Glory, that He &s;ent not only poor <HI>ravenous Indians,</HI> which came with their Baskets of Corn on their Backs, to Trade with us, which was a good Sup|ply unto many; but al&s;o &s;ent <HI>Ships</HI> from <HI>Holland</HI> and from <HI>Ireland</HI> with Provi&s;ions, and Indian Corn from <HI>Virginia,</HI> to &s;upply the Wants of his dear Servants in this Wilderne&s;s, both for Food and Rayment. And when Peoples Wants were great, not only in one Town but in divers Towns; &s;uch was the godly Wi&s;dom, Care and Prudence (not Selfi&s;hne&s;s but Self-Denial) of our Governour <HI>Winthrop</HI> and his <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tants,</HI> that when a Ship came laden with Provi&s;ions, they did Order that the whole Cargo &s;hould be bought for a <HI>general Stock</HI>: And &s;o accordingly, it was, and Di&s;tribu|tion was made to every Town, and to every <HI>Per|&s;on</HI> in each Town, as every Man had need. Thus God was plea&s;ed to care for his People in Times of Straits, and to fill his Servants with Food &amp; Glad|ne&s;s: Then did all the Servants of God Ble&s;s his holy Name, and love one another with pure Hearts fervently.</P>
<P>Before I proceed any further, I will inform you that God &s;tirred up his poor Servants to u&s;e Means
<PB N="15" REF="003403_0019_100315844C6CD4F8">
in their beginning for their Pre&s;ervation; though a low and weak People, yet a willing People to lay out their E&s;tates for the Defence of them&s;elves and others. They having Friends in divers Places who thought it be&s;t for our &s;afety to build a <HI>Fort</HI> upon the I&s;land now called <HI>Ca&s;tle-I&s;land</HI>; at fir&s;t they built a <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> with <HI>Mud-Walls,</HI> which &s;tood divers Years: Fir&s;t Capt. <HI>Simpkins</HI> was Commander thereof, and after him, Lieut. <HI>Moni&s;h,</HI> for a little &s;pace. When the <HI>Mud-Walls</HI> failed, it was built again with <HI>Pine Trees and Earth</HI>; and Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> was Commander. When that decayed, which was within a little Time, there was a &s;mall Ca&s;tle built with <HI>Brick Walls,</HI> and had <HI>three Rooms</HI> in it; a dwelling Room below, a lodging Room over it, the Gun Room over that, wherein &s;tood <HI>Six</HI> very good <HI>Saker Guns,</HI> and over it upon the Top <HI>Three le&s;&s;er Guns.</HI> All the Time of our Weakne&s;s, God was plea&s;ed to give us Peace, until the Wars with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Charles the</HI> II's Time. At that Time our Works were very weak, and Intelligence came to us that <HI>Durother</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Or, DE RUITHER, a famous Dutch Admiral.</NOTE> a Dutch Commander of a Squadron of Ships, was in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and did intend to vi&s;it us; whereupon our <HI>Battery</HI> al&s;o was repaired, wherein are <HI>Seven</HI> good <HI>Guns.</HI> But in the very Time of this Report in <HI>July</HI> 1665, God was plea|&s;ed to &s;end a grievous Storm of Thunder &amp; Light|ning, which did &s;ome hurt at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;truck dead here at the <HI>Ca&s;tle-I&s;land,</HI> that worthy, re|nowned Captain <HI>Richard Davenport</HI>; upon which the <HI>General Court</HI> in <HI>Aug.</HI> 10th following, ap|pointed <HI>another</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was Capt.

that was &s;lain. But behold God wrought for us; for although <HI>Durother</HI> intended to come here, yet God by contrary Winds kept him out; &s;o he went to <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and did great &s;poil there. And again when Danger grew on us by rea&s;on of the late Ware with <HI>Holland,</HI> God permitted our <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> at that very Time to be <HI>Burnt down</HI>; which was on the 21&s;t Day of <HI>March</HI> 1672, 3: But &s;till God was plea&s;ed to keep this Place in Safety: The Lord enlarge our Hearts unto Thank|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I will now return unto what I began to hint unto you before; namely, that <HI>Satan</HI> and his In|&s;truments did malign us, and oppo&s;e our <HI>Godly Preachers,</HI> &s;aying they were <HI>legal</HI> Preachers, but them&s;elves were for free Grace, and for the Teachings of the Spirit: And they prevailed &s;o by their Flatteries and fair Speeches, that they led away not only <HI>Silly Women laden with their Lu&s;ts,</HI> but many <HI>Men</HI> al&s;o, and &s;ome of &s;trong Parts too; who were not a&s;hamed to give out that our Mini&s;ters were but <HI>legal</HI> Preachers, and &s;o endeavoured to bring up an evil Report upon our faithful Preachers, that they them&s;elves might be in high E&s;teem. And many of them would pre&s;ume to Preach in private Hou&s;es, both Men and Women, much like the Quakers. They would talk of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and of <HI>Revelations</HI> by the Spirit without the Word, as the Qua|kers do, talk of the Light within them, rejecting the holy Scriptures. But God by his Servants a&s;&s;embled in a Synod at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in 1637, did di&s;cover his Truth mo&s;t plainly, to the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of his People, and the changing of &s;ome, and to the recovery of not a few, which had been drawn away with their Di&s;&s;imulations. Thus God
<PB N="17" REF="003403_0021_100315445A04F708">
delivered his People out of the Snare of the <HI>Devil</HI> at that Time. Let <HI>Us,</HI> and do <HI>You</HI> in your Gene|rations, Ble&s;s the holy Name of the Lord: <HI>the Snare is broken, and we and ours are delivered.</HI> There were &s;ome that not only &s;tood out ob&s;tinate again&s;t the Truth, but continually reviled both our godly Mini&s;ters and Magi&s;trates, and greatly troubled our <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: But by Order of the <HI>General Court</HI> they were Bani&s;hed out of this Jurisdiction. And then had the <HI>Churches</HI> Re&s;t and were mul|plied.</P>
<P>Many Years after this, <HI>Satan</HI> made another A&s;&s;ault upon God's poor People here, by &s;tirring up the Quakers to come among&s;t us, both Men &amp; Wo|men; who pretended Holine&s;s and Perfection, &s;aying they &s;pake and acted by the <HI>Spirit</HI> &amp; <HI>Light within,</HI> which (as they &s;ay) is their Guide: And mo&s;t Bla&s;phemiou&s;ly &s;aid, that the <HI>Light within</HI> is <HI>the Chri&s;t the Saviour</HI>; and deceived many to their Per&s;wa&s;ion. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Go|vernment and Churches both, did bear witne&s;s again&s;t them, and their loath&s;ome and pernicious Doctrine; for which they were Bani&s;hed out of this Juri&s;diction, not to return without Licence, upon pain of Death. The Rea&s;on of that Law was, becau&s;e God's People here, could not Wor&s;hip the true and living God, as He hath appointed us in our publick A&s;&s;emblies, without being di&s;turbed by them: And other weighty Rea&s;ons; as the Dangerou&s;ne&s;s of their Opinions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some of them pre&s;umed to Return, to the lo&s;s of their Lives, for breaking that Law, which was made for our Peace and Safety.</P>

<P>Now as <HI>Satan</HI> has been a lying Spirit to deceive and en&s;nare the Mind to draw us from God by Error, &s;o hath He &s;tirred up evil Men to &s;eek the Hurt of this Country; but God hath delivered his poor People here from Time to Time: Sometimes by putting Courage into our Magi&s;trates to puni&s;h tho&s;e that did Rebel; and &s;ometimes God hath wrought for us by his Providence other-ways. Here was one <HI>Ratcliff</HI> &s;pake boldly and wickedly again&s;t the Government and Governours here, u&s;ing &s;uch words, as &s;ome judged, de&s;erved Death. He was for his Wickedne&s;s Whipt, and had both his Ears cut off in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> A.D. 1631; I &s;aw it done. There was one <HI>Morton</HI> that was a pe&s;tilent Fel|low, a Troubler of the Country, who did not only &s;eek our Hurt here, but went to <HI>England,</HI> and did his utmo&s;t there, by fal&s;e Reports again&s;t our Governour; but God wrought for us, and
<PB N="19" REF="003403_0023_100315931C194C60">
&s;aved us, and cau&s;ed all his De&s;igns to be of none Effect. There aro&s;e up again&s;t us one <HI>Bull,</HI> who went to the Ea&s;tward a Trading, and turned Pi|rate and took a Ve&s;&s;el or two, and plundred &s;ome Planters thereabouts, and intended to return into the <HI>Bay,</HI> and do Mi&s;chief to our Magi&s;trates here in <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> and other Places: But as they were weighing Anchor, one of Mr. <HI>Short</HI>'s Men &s;hot from the &s;hore, and &s;truck the principal Actor dead, and the Re&s;t were filled with Fear and Horror. They having taken, one <HI>Anthony Dicks</HI> a Ma&s;ter of a Ve&s;&s;el, did endeavour to per&s;wade him to Pilot them unto <HI>Virginia;</HI> but he would not. They told him that they were filled with &s;uch Fear and Horrour, that they were afraid of the very Rattling of the Ropes: This Mr. <HI>Dicks</HI> told me with his own Mouth. The&s;e Men fled Ea&s;tward, and <HI>Bull</HI> him&s;elf got into <HI>England</HI>; but God de&s;troyed this wretched Man. Thus the Lord &s;aved us at this time, from their wicked Device again&s;t us. There was al&s;o one Capt <HI>Stone</HI> about the Year 1633 or 1634 who carried him&s;elf very proudly, and &s;pake contemptuou&s;ly of our Magi&s;trates, and carried it lewdly in his Conver|&s;ation. For his Mi&s;demeanour, his Ship was &s;tayed, but he fled and would not obey Authority; and there came Warrants to <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> to take him dead or alive; &s;o all our Souldiers were in Arms, and Centinals were &s;et in divers Places; and at length he was found in a great Corn-Field, where we took him and carried him to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; but for want of one Witne&s;s, when he came to his Trial, he e&s;caped with his Life. He was &s;aid to be a Man of great Relation, and had great Favour in <HI>Eng|land</HI>; and he gave out threatning Speeches. Tho' he e&s;cap'd with his Life, not being hanged for
<PB N="20" REF="003403_0024_100315949F5BFC10">
Adultery, there being but one Witne&s;s; yet for other Crimes he was fined, and payed it: And being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed he went towards <HI>Virginia</HI>; but by the way putting into the <HI>Pequot Country</HI> to Trade with them, the <HI>Pequots</HI> cut off both him and his Men, took his Goods and burnt his Ship. Some of the Indians reported, That they Roa&s;ted him alive. Thus did God de&s;troy him that &s;o proudly threatned to ruin us by complaining a|gain&s;t us when he came to <HI>England</HI>: Thus God de&s;troyed <HI>him</HI>; and delivered <HI>us</HI> at that time al&s;o.</P>
<P>About that time, or not long after, God per|mitted <HI>Satan</HI> to &s;tir up the <HI>Pequot Indians</HI> to kill divers <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, as Mr. <HI>Oldham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> and others: And when the Murtherers were de|manded, in&s;tead of delivering them, they pro|ceeded to de&s;troy more of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> about <HI>Connecticut</HI>; which put us upon &s;ending out Souldiers, once and again; whom God pro&s;|pered in their Enterprises, until the <HI>Pequot Peo|ple</HI> were de&s;troy'd.

I &s;ay nothing to you of the <HI>late War,</HI> but refer you to the Hi&s;tories in Print. Thus was the Lord plea&s;ed to deliver us at that time al&s;o, and to put a Fear and Dread of Us into the Hearts of the <HI>Indians</HI> round about us: And many of them did voluntarily put them&s;elves under the Government of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It al&s;o plea&s;ed God to put it into the Hearts of &s;ome of our Worthies, to con&s;ider that one End of our coming hither was to Preach the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the <HI>Indians,</HI> for the &s;aving

of God's Elect, and for the bringing into Chri&s;t's Kingdom tho&s;e that were as in High-ways and Hedges. Some did therefore &s;et them&s;elves to learn the <HI>Indian Language,</HI> and &s;o taught them to know GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, whom they never knew or heard of before, nor their Fathers before them; and to know <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> namely their Mi&s;ery by Nature and by rea&s;on of Sin. Among others, the principal was that Revd. Man of God Mr. <HI>John Eliot,</HI> Teacher of the Church of Chri&s;t at <HI>Roxbury</HI>; who&s;e great Labour and Pains in Catechi&s;ing, preaching the Word, and tran&s;lating the BIBLE into the <HI>Indi|an Language,</HI> God has ble&s;&s;ed, I doubt not, to the converting of many among them. <HI>He that Converteth Souls &s;hall &s;hine as the Sun in the Fir|mament.</HI> Oh how glorious will the &s;hining of that Star be in Heaven! I rejoice to think of it.</P>
<P>Furthermore, know ye, that God wrought won|derfully for our Pre&s;ervation, when Men Abroad (and doubtle&s;s &s;ome at Home) endeavoured to overthrow our Government; and prevailed &s;o far, that <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> were &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> hither with &s;uch Power and Authority, that doubtle&s;s put them&s;elves, (and too many among us) in Hopes that they had attained their Ends. They pro|ceeded &s;o far that they &s;et up a Court, appointed the Time and Place, and gave out their Summons; yea for our then Honoured Governour &amp; Company, Per&s;onally to appear before them: But the Lord our God was for us, tho' Troubles were very near: He &s;tirred up a mighty Spirit of Prayer in the Hearts of his People, <HI>This poor Country cryed and the Lord heard and delivered them from all their Fears.</HI> And the Lord put Wi&s;dom and Courage

did &s;olemnly make <HI>Choice</HI> of, and call tho&s;e godly Mini&s;ters to be their <HI>Officers,</HI> &s;o al&s;o the Revd. Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> and Mr. <HI>Maverick</HI> did <HI>accept</HI> there|of, and expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame. So we came, by the good Hand of the Lord, through the Deeps comfor|tably; having Preaching or Expounding of the Word of God <HI>every Day</HI> for <HI>Ten Weeks</HI> together, by our Mini&s;ters. When we came to <HI>Nantasket,</HI> Capt. <HI>Squeb,</HI> who was Captain of that great Ship of <HI>Four Hundred</HI> Tons, would not bring us into <HI>Charles River,</HI> as he was bound to do; but, put us a&s;hore and our Goods on <HI>Nantasket Point,</HI> and left us to &s;hift for our &s;elves in a forlorn place in this Wilderne&s;s. But as it plea&s;ed God, we got a Boat of &s;ome old Planters, and laded her with Goods; and &s;ome able Men well Armed went in her unto <HI>Charle&s;town</HI>: where we found <HI>&s;ome Wig|wams</HI> and <HI>one Hou&s;e,</HI> and in the Hou&s;e there was a Man which had a boiled <HI>Ba&s;s,</HI> but no <HI>Bread</HI> that we &s;ee: but we did eat of his Ba&s;s, and then went up <HI>Charles River,</HI> until the River grew nar|row and &s;hallow, and there we landed our Goods with much Labour and Toil, the Bank being &s;teep. And Night coming on, we were informed that there were hard by us <HI>Three Hundred Indians</HI>: One <HI>Engli&s;h Man</HI> that could &s;peak the <HI>Indian Lan|guage</HI> (an old Planter) went to them and advi&s;ed them not to come near us in the Night; and they hearkened to his Coun&s;el, and came not. I my &s;elf was one of the Centinals that fir&s;t Night: Our Captain was a Low Country Souldier, one Mr. <HI>Southcot,</HI> a brave Souldier. In the Morning &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> came and &s;tood at a di&s;tance off, looking at us, but came not near us; but when they had been a while in view, &s;ome of them came and held out a great <HI>Ba&s;s</HI> towards us; &s;o we &s;ent
<PB N="24" REF="003403_0028_100315A29FD21670">
a Man with a Bisket, and changed the Cake for the Ba&s;s. Afterwards they &s;upplyed us with Ba&s;s, exchanging a Ba&s;s for a Bisket-Cake, and were <HI>very friendly</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>Dear Children</HI>! Forget not what Care God had over his dear Servants, to watch over us, and protect us in our weak beginnings. Capt. <HI>Squeb</HI> turned a&s;hore Us and our Goods, like a mercyle&s;s Man; but God, even <HI>our merciful God,</HI> took pity on us; &s;o that we were &s;upplied, fir&s;t with a Boat, and then cau&s;ed many <HI>Indians,</HI> (&s;ome <HI>Hundreds</HI>) to be ruled by the Advice of <HI>one Man,</HI> not to come near us: Alas had they come upon us, how &s;oon might they have de&s;troyed us! I think <HI>We</HI> were not above <HI>Ten</HI> in Number. But God cau&s;ed the <HI>Indians</HI> to help us with Fi&s;h at very cheap Rates. We had not been there many Days, (although by our Diligence we had got up a kind of Shelter, to &s;ave our Goods in) but we had Order to come away from that Place, (which was about <HI>Watertown</HI>) unto a Place called <HI>Mat|tapan</HI> (now <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI>) becau&s;e there was a <HI>Neck of Land</HI> fit to keep our Cattle on: So we removed and came to <HI>Mattapan</HI>: The <HI>Indians</HI> there al&s;o were kind unto us.</P>
<P>Not long after, came <HI>our renowned &amp; ble&s;&s;ed Governour,</HI> and divers of <HI>his A&s;&s;i&s;tants</HI> with him. Their Ships came into <HI>Charles River,</HI> and many Pa&s;&s;engers landed at <HI>Charl&s;town,</HI> many of whom died the Winter following. Governour <HI>Winthrop</HI> purpo&s;ed to &s;et down his Station about <HI>Cambridge,</HI> or &s;omewhere on the River; but clewing the Place, liked that <HI>plain Neck</HI> that was called then <HI>Black-&s;tones-Neck,</HI> now <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> But in the mean

time, before they could build at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> they lived many of them in Tents and Wigwams at <HI>Charl&s;town</HI>; their <HI>Meeting-Place</HI> being abroad under a <HI>Tree</HI>; where I have heard Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> Preach many a good Sermon.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Days God did cau&s;e his People to tru&s;t in him, and to be contented with mean things. It was not accounted a &s;trange thing in tho&s;e Days to drink <HI>Water,</HI> and to eat <HI>Samp</HI> or <HI>Homine</HI> without Butter or Milk. Indeed it would have been a &s;trange thing to &s;ee a piece of Roa&s;t Beef, Mutton or Veal; though it was not long before there was Roa&s;t <HI>Goat.</HI> After the fir&s;t Winter, we were very Healthy; though &s;ome of us had no great Store of Corn. The <HI>Indians</HI> did &s;ometimes bring Corn, and Truck with us for Cloathing and Knives; and once I had a Peck of Corn or thereabouts, for a little Puppy-Dog. <HI>Fro&s;t-fi&s;h, Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Clams</HI> were a Relief to many. If our Provi&s;ion be better <HI>now</HI> than it was <HI>then,</HI> let us not, (and do you dear Children take heed that you do not) forget the Lord <HI>our</HI> God.

And when you are alone at any Time, Think with your &s;elf, a&s;|&s;uredly God is pre&s;ent tho' none el&s;e; I will Confe&s;s my Sins, and I will beg God's Fa|vour and Grace, I will Wre&s;tle with God by Faith and Prayer.

<P>In the Year 1629, when many of the mo&s;t godly <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>People</HI> were driven out of the Kingdom for their con&s;cientious Nonconformity to the <HI>E&s;ta, bli&s;hed Way of Wor&s;hip,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ma|verick.</HI> (who were afterwards Colleague Pa&s;tors of the Church of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) and with them a con&s;iderable Number of pious Per&s;ons were preparing for a Remove into this Country; Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> found in him&s;elf a &s;trong Inclination to go with tho&s;e good People, and ca&s;t in his Lot with them. He had taken a great liking unto the Mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Warham,</HI> and was not willing to be left behind, when He was to go: and therefore having with &s;ome Difficulty obtained his Father's Con&s;ent, he &s;et him&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the great and good Work the People of God then had in hand.&mdash;He with tho&s;e good People that came over with him, (who were the fir&s;t Inhabitants of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI>) &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>England</HI> the 20th Day of <HI>March</HI> 1629, 30; and after a comfortable (tho' long) Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ten Weeks,</HI> they arrived at <HI>Hull</HI> the 30th of <HI>May</HI> 1630. This was the <HI>Fir&s;t Company</HI> that &s;etled on this &s;ide <HI>Salem:</HI> and therefore be&s;ure they met with Trials &amp; Difficulties enough, which did not at all di&s;hearten Mr. <HI>Clap</HI>; for his Heart was &s;o taken off from temporal Things, and

<P>In the &s;ame Year that He came over here, He join|ed him&s;elf a Member of the Church in <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> where he lived, and continued a Member of this Church for the &s;pace of <HI>Sixty Years</HI>; being a u&s;eful In&s;trument both in Church and Town. When he had been about <HI>Two Years and half</HI> in the Country, in the Year 1633, <HI>Novemb.</HI> 6th in the 25th Year of his Age, he married the vertuous Mrs. <HI>Johanna Ford,</HI> Daughter of Mr. <HI>Thomas Ford</HI> of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> when &s;he was but in the 17th Year of her Age: who with her Parents came over in the &s;ame Ship with him&s;elf, and &s;etled al&s;o here in <HI>Dor|che&s;ter</HI>; with whom he lived in the Conjugal Rela|tion for the &s;pace of 57 Years. She was a godly and exemplary Woman, given to Ho&s;pitality: She aboun|ded in Acts of Charity; &s;o that when proper Objects of Pity and Charity came to her Knowledge, &s;he never failed to relieve them her&s;elf, or procure them Relief from others: <HI>Thus the Ble&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e that were ready to Peri&s;h came upon her.</HI></P>
<P>Among other Ble&s;&s;ings wherewith it plea&s;ed God to Ble&s;s this pious Couple, the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Brea&s;ts and of the Womb were not the lea&s;t; for they had Fourteen <HI>Children,</HI> Ten <HI>Sons</HI> and Four <HI>Daughters.</HI> But God was plea&s;ed to prove the&s;e his Servants with Afflictions al&s;o, as well as Mercies; for <HI>Five</HI> of their <HI>Children</HI> Died in their Infancy; their Son <HI>Thomas</HI> died at 15 Years of Age, and their Son <HI>Unite</HI> at 7 Years. And in the Year 1686, their Son <HI>Supply,</HI> a hopefull young Man in the Flower and Prime of his Age, was &s;uddenly taken out of the World, by the Accidental

<P>Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> being thus &s;etled as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>in God's Hou&s;e and among his People,</HI> he &s;et him&s;elf to &s;erve God and his Generation according to the Will of God. His Qualifications were quickly ob&s;erved by the People of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI>; and they early Improved him in the Affairs of their new Plantation.

<P>Capt. <HI>Clap</HI> having now the Command of the Ca&s;tle, di&s;charged that Tru&s;t with great Fidelity; and was therein &s;erviceable to the whole Province, and uni|ver&s;ally Re&s;pected and Honoured.

<P>There is another In&s;tance that &s;hows what an In|tere&s;t Capt. <HI>Clap</HI> had in the Hearts of God's People, and what an exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing they accounted him: it is this; In the Year 1672, he being then <HI>Captain of the Ca&s;tle,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it him with a Fit of Sickne&s;s; and the good People of <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> unto

<P>When he commanded the Ca&s;tle, he re&s;ided there with his Family; and a well ordered Family it was: Capt <HI>Clap</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI> were Examples of Piety: <HI>Their Light &s;hone before others, to the Glory of their heavenly Father.</HI> He was a very Prayerful Man, and was ob&s;er|ved to retire often for Secret Duties: And in his <HI>Fa|mily</HI> (unto which all the Souldiers under his Com|mand al&s;o belonged) he daily offered up the Sacrifices of Prayer and Thanksgiving; in which, if he under|&s;tood his Prolixity were di&s;agreeable to any, he would be Troubled thereat.
