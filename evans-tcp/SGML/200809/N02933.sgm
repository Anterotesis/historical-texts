<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BY Virtue of that &s;timulating Pa&s;&s;ion or Prin|ciple of</HI> Imitation, <HI>&s;o deeply radicated in hu|man Nature,</HI> Example <HI>has u&s;ually a very attractive Force and Government over Man|kind, and a di&s;tingui&s;hing Efficacy on</HI> young <HI>People in particular. Whatever is the latent Cau&s;e, we find by con|&s;tant Experience, it &s;trikes very powerfully on their ten|der &amp; ductile Minds; is more engaging than the &s;trong|e&s;t and mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive Rea&s;onings, or the mo&s;t &s;olemn Precepts of Superiors; and has the earlie&s;t Influence, to bias their Thoughts and Inclinations, and to form their Deportment. Thus 'tis in Morality &amp; Civils; and thus in Chri&s;tianity &amp; Spirituals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It's of great Importance therefore,</HI> what Precedents <HI>young People have &s;et before them, in the Family and Place of their Education: and of happy Tendency, when</HI> good <HI>Examples pre&s;ent them&s;elves betimes, to pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s them in Favour of pure Religion and the be&s;t Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of GOD, that He has in the &s;acred Scriptures pre&s;erv'd brief</HI> Memorials <HI>of many primitive</HI> Saints; <HI>&s;ome of whom were &s;hining Patterns of</HI> early <HI>Piety: the Review of which, while young ones have been reading their Bible, has often led them by a &s;weet and powerful Con&s;traint into the Con&s;ideration, Love and Practice of the Things that plea&s;e GOD, and Things that accompany Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Conformity to Scripture Sample, many</HI> biographi|cal <HI>Pieces, of human Compo&s;ure, have been publi&s;h'd by Chri&s;tian Writers from Age to Age. Among others, large Accounts have been exhibited to the World of the</HI>

Lives <HI>of &s;ome young &amp; eminent Chri&s;tians&punc; and &s;horter Memoirs have been given of many others, particularly in</HI> Funeral-Sermons: <HI>which by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD have often been of &s;ingular U&s;e, to promote the early Practice of Piety, by provoking Survivors of the &s;ame Age to an holy Emulation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I look upon it the primary Bu&s;ine&s;s of Funeral-Di&s;|cour&s;es, not &s;o much to prai&s;e the</HI> Dead, <HI>as in&s;truct the</HI> Living; <HI>to give GOD the Glory of his Grace be&s;tow'd on the Decea&s;ed, and to enforce a Care of Religion, by the Advantage of their Example, on the Surviving. In&s;tances of</HI> early <HI>Piety, e&s;pecially where it has been &s;ignal too for the Degree, &s;eem to claim a pecu|liar Notice: And</HI> publick Characters <HI>in this Ca&s;e are wont to be entertain'd with a peculiar Candour and Attention; while on other Occa&s;ions many times ground|le&s;s Prejudices are unhappy Impediments to a candid Reception of them, altho' drawn up with the wi&s;e&s;t Caution, and the exacte&s;t Regard to Truth of Fact, as well as Sobriety of Language.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was very much pleas'd in hearing the</HI> Funeral-Character, <HI>in the following Sermon, from the Pulpit, on &s;o</HI> ju&s;t an Occa&s;ion: <HI>and am glad now to &s;ee it in the publick Light. As it &s;eem'd very</HI> acceptable, <HI>to an attentive Audience; I wi&s;h it may be no le&s;s</HI> pro|fitable, <HI>to every Reader, and particularly to young People, by &s;tirring up their Re&s;olutions and En|deavours of conforming to the bright Pattern here bro't to their View: concerning which,</HI> Much in a little <HI>is &s;aid with</HI> Words of Truth &amp; Soberne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>'Twas the Hope of doing &s;ome Service to the great Ends of the Go&s;pel, among the ri&s;ing Generation in &s;pecial, by propo&s;ing a remarkable</HI> Example <HI>of early Religion, that at length prevail'd on my Rev. Bro|ther to give way to the Importunity, with which this Publication was called for. May the pious De&s;ires of the Author and the Publi&s;hers be abundantly an&s;wer'd, in the quickning of many to be</HI> "Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es!</P>

<HI>May the</HI> bereaved Parents, <HI>while mourning the Death of their lovely Child (&s;aying,</HI> "Alas my Daughter) <HI>often refre&s;h their &s;orrowful Minds by reflecting on her holy Walk with GOD, &amp; peaceful End, &amp; taking a Pro&s;|pect of that bli&s;sful World, they have &s;uch Rea&s;on to hope, &s;he is tran&s;lated to!

<L><HI>Wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way?</HI></L>
<L><HI>By taking heed thereto according to thy word.</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY text is not the only pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, that mentions the <HI>young man</HI> by name, and calls upon him to keep him&s;elf pure from the defilements of this evil World. Per|haps the de&s;ign of the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> herein might be, to place an empha&s;is upon this age of life, and recommend Religion as a bu&s;ine&s;s peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable for per&s;ons in their young and tender years. 'Tis cer|tain, religion never appears more lovely, than as ex|emplify'd in the well order'd conver&s;ation of tho&s;e, who are in the bloom of life. Nor can &s;uch employ their time and pains, more to the divine honor and accep|tance, or their own true&s;t advantage, than by an <HI>early</HI> care in governing their appetites, purifying their hearts, and forming within them&s;elves the &s;eeds and principles of virtue and a holy life.</P>
<P>AND to engage our <HI>young people</HI> in a zealous appli|cation of them&s;elves, in the u&s;e of all proper means, to &s;uch noble purpo&s;es, is the de&s;ign I have in view from the words which have been red to you.</P>

THEY are found in that in&s;pired P&s;alm which is the longe&s;t, and (as &s;ome think) the mo&s;t artfully compo&s;ed of any in the whole book of P&s;alms. The general &s;cope of it is, to &s;hew forth the <HI>excellency</HI> of the <HI>written</HI> word and laws of God: and 'tis ju&s;tly admir'd for that variety of tho't, in which it recom|mends them to our practice.</P>
<P>IT has been di&s;puted who was the <HI>penman</HI> of the P&s;alm; but &s;o much of the <HI>royal Prophet</HI> is apparent in every part, that 'tis generally a&s;crib'd to <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>THE ver&s;e I have cho&s;en for my text&punc; is made up of two parts; a <HI>que&s;tion,</HI> and an <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to it.</P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t part of my text contains a <HI>que&s;tion; wherewith &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way?</HI> By <HI>a young man</HI> we are here to under&s;tand <HI>all</HI> in their youthful days; both <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women.</HI> And from the expre&s;s men|tion of per&s;ons of this age and character, we are natu|rally led to look upon tho&s;e, who are in the prime and vigor of life, as under <HI>peculiar</HI> obligations to become &s;eriou&s;ly pious and &s;ober: for <HI>this</HI> is the great thing meant by <HI>clean&s;ing their way;</HI> which they would not, with &s;uch <HI>particularity,</HI> have had urg'd upon them, if there had not been &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial</HI> rea&s;ons binding them hereto, as their inviolable duty.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible there are &s;everal things of con&s;iderable importance, obviou&s;ly implied in the phra&s;e of my text, under which the duty of early Piety is recommended to us. And I might accordingly to good purpo&s;e em|ploy your meditations, both on the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>contract|ed</HI> filth, young per&s;ons are too commonly defiled with: As al&s;o, the particulars of that purity of <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> wherein con&s;i&s;ts the &s;um of true Religion. But as I'm oblig'd to confine my &s;elf to a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, and it may be pre&s;umed we are fully in&s;tructed in the&s;e things, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, and make it my only bu&s;ine&s;s from this part of my text,</P>
<P>To repre&s;ent to you, in as clear and &s;trong a light as I am able, <HI>the &s;pecial Con&s;iderations that oblige young per&s;ons to be religious in their early days.</HI></P>
<P>And here I would offer as follows,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003518_0008_0FF855501E4367F0">
I. THIS age of life is the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t conve|nient,</HI> in which to enter upon a religious cour&s;e. I would charitably hope, there are few if any, but look upon a religious life to be a matter of nece&s;&s;ity: which they have accordingly determined to betake them&s;elves to, &s;ome time or other; as they would not give up all hope of future and eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And if religion be at all a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, 'tis certainly wi&s;dom to take that &s;ea&s;on to engage in it, which is the faire&s;t and be&s;t; the lea&s;t entangled with difficulty, and attended with the mo&s;t hopeful pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Now &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on is the <HI>age of youth.</HI> We may, at this time of life, begin and go on in a religious cour&s;e, with grea|ter advantage than we &s;hall be ever able to do after|wards.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, &s;ome difficulties, that &s;eem almo&s;t peculiar to this age of life: As a high reli&s;h of the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e; the ungo|vernablene&s;s of carnal appetites and evil pa&s;&s;ions; an exceeding aptne&s;s to be &s;educed by bad example; an over airine&s;s and gaiety of temper; want of judgment and experience; ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;icklene&s;s, incon&s;ideration, and the like. But the&s;e inconveniences are va&s;tly more than ballanc'd, by di&s;tingui&s;hing advantages common to the days of youth.</P>
<P>WE are <HI>now</HI> mo&s;t free from a wrong bia&s;s; and lie mo&s;t open to the impre&s;&s;ions of religious principles, and the power of tho&s;e <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> motives, by which the practice of true piety is recommended and enforced. For this age of life is ea&s;ily wrought upon, and moulded almo&s;t in|to any form. "A young and tender plant readily takes the ply, which he who tends it thinks proper to give; and if by accident it becomes warp'd, and has receiv|ed a wrong bent, by due and early care 'tis ea&s;ily reduced: but if it be &s;uffered to continue &s;o a con&s;ide|rable time without &s;uitable attendance, and grow old; it becomes &s;tubborn and inflexible."</P>
<P>ALSO, we are <HI>now</HI> mo&s;t under the influence of con&s;|cience, and a natural &s;en&s;e of &s;hame and mode&s;ty; than which there are &s;carce any &s;tronger re&s;traints to keep
<PB N="4" REF="003518_0009_0FF85553098E7110">
us from doing evil. As corrupt as humane nature is, per&s;ons can't at fir&s;t commit &s;in without trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s from con&s;cience; and they have naturally &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the indecency and irregularity of mo&s;t wicked actions, as that they ordinarily &s;tart back from their fir&s;t approaches towards them. I doubt not but mo&s;t men have had their innocence pre&s;erved in many in&s;tances, by the &s;ole help of innate mode&s;ty &amp; &s;hame; which powerful principles can't at once be &s;tifled and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>BESIDES, &s;in has not <HI>yet</HI> got &s;o full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us; nor have we contracted &s;o many vicious Habits; nor are they &s;o deeply rooted, as in tho&s;e who have for a con&s;iderable length of time accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to do evil. For by repeating the acts of &s;in, the habit is &s;trangely encouraged; and by degrees will become &s;o ob&s;tinate, as to make it almo&s;t an impo&s;&s;ibility to get recovered from it. The prophet therefore de&s;cribes this matter in &s;uch &s;trong language as that, <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good, that are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. 13. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>MOREOVER, fewer clogs and incumbrances <HI>now</HI> lie in the way of religion, than there will, when we come to &s;ettle in the world, and are entangled with bu&s;ine&s;s; the cares, temptations, difficulties, hurries and di&s;appoint|ments of which, are &s;o many and great, as will en|danger our not &s;o much as thinking of our Souls; if a &s;en&s;e of religion has not before been impre&s;&s;ed upon our minds. And under the&s;e circum&s;tances we &s;hall be far more likely to put off the bu&s;ine&s;s of Salvation, than ever before. Our unexperience of the world may keep us from feeling the force of this argument; but the further we get into the world, and become acquaint|ed with the cares and di&s;tractions of it, the more weight &s;hall we find to be in it.</P>
<P>FURTHER, we &s;hall certainly have more time for the work of religion, if we engage in it <HI>now.</HI> For every
<PB N="5" REF="003518_0010_0FF85554A69388B8">
moment we defer this work, the &s;pace allotted to us for the accompli&s;hment of it, is ju&s;t in the &s;ame pro|portion le&s;&s;ened. This perhaps we may not be much concerned about: imagining religion to be a matter of ea&s;e; a bu&s;ine&s;s we may begin and fini&s;h at our lei|&s;ure. But we are herein greatly mi&s;taken. 'Tis truly a hard and difficult matter to be &s;incerely pious, and will require a great deal of time and labour. And if ever we are made &s;eriou&s;ly concerned about our Souls, we &s;hall certainly find it to be &s;o. 'Tis therefore an advantage, the longer time we have for the work of getting our &s;elves prepared for heavenly happine&s;s: And if we are wi&s;e for eternity, we can't but e&s;teem it to be &s;o. To be &s;ure, the longer time we have, the greater progre&s;s we &s;hall be able to make in holine&s;s, and the more &s;trengthned will the habits of vertue be likely to be in us; the more mature and perfect the graces of God's holy Spirit. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever be eminent in piety; exemplary proficients in grace and goodne&s;s, if we cut &s;hort the time to improve here|in, by not entring upon a life of religion till we have pa&s;s'd the prime of our days.</P>
<P>IN FINE, we have in this age of life the mo&s;t hope|ful pro&s;pect, of being <HI>effectually</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>holy Spi|rit of God,</HI> in the great work of &s;erving our maker. For young per&s;ons may, at lea&s;t ordinarily, be &s;uppos'd to have lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> quench'd his motions, &s;tiffled convictions and oppos'd the methods of divine grace. And having given lea&s;t provocation to the holy Spirit, there is the lea&s;t danger of his withdraw, and giving over to &s;trive with us. And of all per&s;ons, <HI>We</HI> have the highe&s;t encouragement, upon &s;uitable applica|tions herefor, to expect tho&s;e &s;upernatural operations and a&s;&s;i&s;tances that are needful for us. 'Tis in experience found true, the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> u&s;ually &s;trives more with young per&s;ons than others: They are oftner bro't un|der convictions; filled with concern about their Souls; and made &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive, <HI>what they mu&s;t do that they may inherit eternal life?</HI> In this age, we are <HI>mo&s;t likely</HI> to be wro't upon and prevailed with: and there|fore the holy Spirit does not lo&s;e this <HI>be&s;t</HI> opportunity; but improves it by <HI>more abundant</HI> &s;trivings and motions in us.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003518_0011_0FF85556DFFB7448">
AND O how great is our advantage, in being actu|ally under the influences of God's Spirit! and the mo&s;t hopeful pro&s;pect of all &s;upernatural aids, as we may need them! There cannot be a &s;tronger encouragement to us, to enter upon a religious cour&s;e in the&s;e our fir&s;t days. For of our &s;elves we can never turn to God, or &s;erve him to his acceptance. The a&s;&s;i&s;tances of divine grace are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary hereto: and in this time of life <HI>the&s;e</HI> we do in &s;ome mea&s;ure enjoy: and have the highe&s;t rea&s;on further to except them, in degrees proportionable to our wants. And is it pru|dence to make no u&s;e of &s;uch an ine&s;timable priviledge? And &s;hall we not by &s;lighting and de&s;pi&s;ing it, pro|voke God to re&s;olve, that <HI>his Spirit &s;hall not</HI> afterwards <HI>&s;trive with us?</HI> And to &s;ay concerning one and another of us, <HI>"I have done with him, and he &s;hall hear no more of my de&s;pi&s;ed offers, nor any more reject the motions of my Spirit: Let him now take his own cour&s;e, he &s;hall for a while hear no more from me, till I &s;peak in quite another man|ner; and</HI> rend the caul of his heart, <HI>and take away his rebellious Soul."</HI></P>
<P>II.

Tho' we &s;hould have &s;pent the fir&s;t of our time and &s;trength in the &s;ervice of &s;in and Satan; yet if we afterwards heartily devote our &s;elves to God, and faithfully employ our powers to the purpo&s;es of a holy life, he will not upbraid us with our former folly, or deny us his favour. The repentance of a &s;inner is al|ways matter of joy to the ble&s;&s;ed God: He conceives a plea&s;ure at this, in what&s;oever age of life, we come to our &s;elves, and return to our duty; and will readi|ly receive us to mercy. But <HI>early Piety</HI> is <HI>peculiarly</HI> plea&s;ing and acceptable to God. He has the mo&s;t en|deared affection for young Converts: None &s;o welcome to him, or that meet with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing regards from him.

IV. THERE <HI>is great hazard we &s;hall never be religious, if we ben't &s;o in this age of life.</HI> For who of us knows, whether our youthful days are not the only ones, we have to live in the world? Whether God has not de&s;igned us to be in the number of tho&s;e <HI>millions,</HI> who <HI>die in youth? in</HI> their <HI>full &s;trength,</HI> being <HI>wholly at ea&s;e and quiet;</HI> having their <HI>brea&s;ts full of milk, and bones moi&s;tned with marrow.</HI> Or if we were &s;ecure of our lives, is there not danger, when we have <HI>vext</HI> and <HI>griev'd</HI> and <HI>quench'd</HI> the <HI>Spirit,</HI> of his departing from us? Would it be any wonder, if <HI>He</HI> &s;hould &s;o re&s;ent our contempt of him, in re&s;i&s;ting his motions and &s;tiffling convictions, as to retire and withdraw forever? And would not this be a fatal bar to our ever turning to God? &s;ince of our &s;elves we can do nothing, and mu&s;t have our <HI>chief</HI> dependance upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of divine grace. But be&s;ides, what likelihood is there of our being re|covered to God and duty, after we are grown old in &s;in, when we could not be prevailed with in our young and tender years? While young our hearts are &s;oft; our wills pliable and yielding; our con&s;ciences ea&s;ily awaken'd, affections mov'd, and minds impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of religion: And if when under the&s;e advanta|gious circum&s;tances, we are not re&s;trained by the word, nor providence, nor Spirit of God, from <HI>walking in the way of the ungodly;</HI> what probable pro&s;pect is there of our being call'd back <HI>afterwards,</HI> and converted to God? And the hope of this will be &s;till le&s;s, after we have long continued in our evil cour&s;es: for by this means we &s;hall contract and render ob&s;tinate and inveterate, innumerable vicious habits; &s;hall very much weaken, if not quite de&s;troy, the influence and authority of con&s;ci|ence; &s;hall make our hearts like an <HI>adamant &s;tone,</HI> hard and unrelenting; and in a word, &s;hall become &s;tupid and intirely lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue and religion. And under the&s;e circum&s;tances, what hope is there of our repentance and conver&s;ion to God? 'Tis indeed a po&s;&s;ible thing; but there is little more than a naked po&s;&s;ibility of it. <HI>Nicodemus'</HI>s que&s;tion is in this ca&s;e very pertinent, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> 'Tis a mo&s;t unlikely thing! one of the greate&s;t rarities!

<P>OUR obligations hereto are very &s;olemn and particu|lar: and I would fain hope, we are &s;o far convinc'd of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of complying with them, as that we are re&s;olved upon loving and &s;erving our mo&s;t merciful God and father.</P>
<P>BUT it may be we flatter our &s;elves with the tho't, of having a <HI>more convenient</HI> &s;ea&s;on for the work of religion, in the after-part of life: and &s;o are for putting it off till then.

Multitudes of the &s;ame age and character with our &s;elves, die within the reach of our ob&s;ervation: And who can &s;ay, it won't be our own lot to die young? And if this &s;hould be our ca&s;e, "how &s;trange and unrea&s;onable will our conduct appear to be? Rea&s;onable creatures &s;ent into the world to &s;eek and &s;erve God, and made capable of it, and that had time for it; but went out of the world, and &s;pent all their time in an utter di&s;regard and neglect of God, and for|getfulne&s;s, of the principal end and bu&s;ine&s;s of life!"

For let us pitch on what part of life we plea&s;e, it will be incumber'd with difficulties of one &s;ort or another; and innumerable pretences for delay will offer them&s;elves, and be apt without the greate&s;t re&s;olu|tion, to prevail with us. We &s;hall be ready to &s;ay with our &s;elves, "to morrow will we amend our ways; and when that to morrow comes, we &s;hall &s;till &s;ay to morrow: and &s;o our to-morrow will prove endle&s;s."

For 'tis an affair of <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> what mu&s;t be engaged in, as ever we would hope for admi&s;&s;ion into the eternal Kingdom of God. And therefore the proper u&s;e to be made of the difficulties of religion, is not to di&s;courage our &s;elves from &s;etting about it; but to put on &s;o much the more re&s;olution, to labour in it with the utmo&s;t &s;peed and all po&s;&s;ible diligence. And in &s;o doing, we may upon good grounds expect, aids of divine grace proportionable to the need we &s;tand in of them, and the difficulties and temptations we may meet with.</P>
<P>BUT, what is <HI>peculiarly</HI> matter of encouragement in this ca&s;e is, that notwith&s;tanding all the difficulties of a reli|gious cour&s;e, many <HI>young per&s;ons</HI> have been enabled to go thro' them, and to become illu&s;trious patterns of an early clo&s;e walk with God. The Scripture in&s;tances of this &s;ort we are all acquainted with. Nor have there been wanting, even from among our &s;elves, remarkable exam|ples of the &s;ame kind. And this leads me to make men|tion of a young woman of this Congregation, ELISABETH PRICE, who was the la&s;t week followed to her grave; of whom it may with good rea&s;on be &s;aid, &s;he was an un|common in&s;tance of that early piety, of which we have been &s;peaking. And as this is a ca&s;e, wherein I flatter my &s;elf I &s;han't be &s;u&s;pected of &s;ini&s;ter views, I have been the rather inclined to take publick notice of it to the ho|nor of free grace, and to recommend religion to our choice and practice in our youthful days.</P>
<P>FROM a child &s;he was deeply impre&s;s'd with an awe and reverence of God; which remarkably manife&s;ted it &s;elf, upon the fir&s;t deliberate exerci&s;es of her rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, in a careful endeavour to ab&s;tain from
<PB N="16" REF="003518_0021_0FF812A763E1DA20">
tho&s;e things, &s;he apprehended to be evil: being to a &s;cru|ple fearful lea&s;t in any thing &s;he &s;hould offend God. Particularly, &s;he di&s;covered a great abhorrence of the <HI>&s;in of lying;</HI> and guarded again&s;t that <HI>vain, tho'tle&s;s tem|per</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> which are &s;o incident to <HI>childhood</HI> &amp; <HI>youth:</HI> and often expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure thereat, to tho&s;e of her acquaintance, in whom &s;he perceived the&s;e faults to reign.</P>
<P>SHE was ob&s;erved to be con&s;tant, even from her mo&s;t early days, in retirements <HI>evening</HI> and <HI>morning,</HI> to pour out her &s;oul before God: except only when &s;he now and then intermitted this duty; which &s;he never did from a negligent carele&s;s frame of &s;pirit, as is too commonly the ca&s;e: but whenever &s;he was blameable in this kind, it proceeded from perplexing fears and temptations, un|common to one of her age; for which omi&s;&s;ions &s;he was heartily &s;orry, and would bitterly complain of her &s;elf.</P>
<P>HER carriage towards her parents was full of love, tenderne&s;s, honor and reverence. She chearfully obey'd their commands; attended their in&s;tructions; hearkned to their advice, and follow'd their coun&s;els. And as &s;he did not allow of the lea&s;t un&s;eemly di&s;obedient behaviour towards them in her &s;elf; &s;o neither could &s;he bear to &s;ee it in her <HI>brethren</HI> and <HI>&s;i&s;ters.</HI> And whenever &s;he ob&s;erv|ed any di&s;coveries of di&s;re&s;pect, irreverence or undutiful|ne&s;s, either in their words, looks or actions; it would &s;en&s;ibly affect and grieve her: e&s;pecially when they were gro&s;ly guilty. And &s;he would not <HI>now</HI> fail of taking an opportunity, to repre&s;ent to them the &s;in of undutifulne&s;s to parents; how offen&s;ive it was to God and provoking in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>SHE was favoured with a peculiarly &s;oft and tender con&s;cience, which made her watchful again&s;t &s;in, careful to avoid even the appearances of it, and to maintain a clo&s;e walk with God. And <HI>this,</HI> when many times &s;he was under great &s;piritual fears and darkne&s;s. So far as I could ob&s;erve, &s;he was of a tho'tful pen&s;ive temper; and by her con&s;titution &s;ubject &s;ometimes to the power of melancholy: to which I attribute her not enjoying, at

lea&s;t for a con&s;tancy, the comforts of religion, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure as might be expected: Tho' I doubt not the hand of Satan, was evidently to be &s;een in many of the temptations, di&s;couragements &amp; perplexing fears, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed thro'; which were greater and of a more extraordinary nature, than is u&s;ual for per&s;ons of &s;o few years.</P>
<P>I don't remember &s;he was able to &s;ix upon the <HI>particular time,</HI> in which &s;he tho't &s;he might pa&s;s under a work of &s;anctifying grace. Nor is it at all to be wondred at: When it was never ob&s;erved, that the principles of corruption were <HI>habitually</HI> predominant in her, in any part of her life. From the <HI>first</HI> appearances of rea&s;on, and <HI>all along</HI> till the time of her death, her <HI>general</HI> temper and behaviour were &s;uch as gave grounds to hope, that from <HI>a child</HI> &s;he was &s;avingly converted to God. A mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing priviledge!&mdash;Thrice happy they that are the &s;ubjects of it!&mdash;The grace herein di&s;covered, can never be enough magnify'd and admir'd!</P>
<P>SHE was a great reader of her <HI>bible;</HI> not &s;uffering it to lie by a neglected book: but as her <HI>delight</HI> was <HI>in the law of God,</HI> &s;o did &s;he make it <HI>the man of her coun&s;el;</HI> repairing to it upon all emergent occa&s;ions, be&s;ides her more &s;tated times for &s;tudying of it.</P>
<P>SHE was a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the <HI>Sabbath;</HI> behaving her &s;elf as one that had an awakened &s;en&s;e of the &s;olemnity of the day: con&s;tantly went up to the <HI>place of publick Wor|&s;hip;</HI> where &s;he appeared with a vi&s;ible awe and reverence, and attended with &s;uch care and diligence, as that &s;he was able to bring home, and <HI>from her memory</HI> repeat, more of the <HI>preached word,</HI> than is common for per&s;ons grown to years; who yet are per&s;ons of good under&s;tanding. And tho' thro a mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as if it was an Ordinance de&s;igned only for Chri&s;tians of more than ordinary attainments in holine&s;s, and &s;atisfaction about their good e&s;tate; &s;he dare not venture to approach to it: yet &s;he would not willingly neglect being pre&s;ent at the admini&s;tration of it; at which times &s;he was often mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected, and her Soul refre&s;hed and comforted.</P>
<P>IN her &s;ickne&s;s, by which &s;he was for a con&s;iderable time detained from the hou&s;e of God, 'twas admirable to behold
<PB N="18" REF="003518_0023_0FF85572572C0D78">
her breathings after God <HI>in his Sanctuary.</HI> With holy <HI>Da|vid,</HI> her <HI>&s;oul thir&s;ted for God, the living God:</HI> and that was her complaint, <HI>O when &s;hall I come and appear before God!</HI></P>
<P>HER bodily pains were great and of long continuance; which gave opportunity for the illu&s;tration of divine grace, in that uncommon degree of patience, meekne&s;s, contented|ne&s;s and &s;ubjection to the father of &s;pirits, &s;he was an emi|nent pattern of: never complaining; never murmuring; but always acknowledging her own de&s;erts, and ju&s;tifying God in all that he laid upon her.</P>
<P>'TIS to be hoped her <HI>brethren</HI> and <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> will never for|get her calling them to her bed-&s;ide; when with a holy freedom of &s;oul &s;he gave her dying te&s;timony in behalf of religion, and took her farewell of them: with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s be&s;eeching and exhorting them,<HI>to &s;eek and &s;erve God in their youthful days; to improve the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of grace, and time of their youth to the purpo&s;es of a holy life.</HI> And O! with what fervor of Soul did &s;he repeat the words, O THAT WE MAY DIE IN PEACE! AND MEET TOGETHER IN GLORY AT THE DAY OF CHRIST! Nor did her concern for religion end here; but &s;he advis'd, caution'd and exhorted all that came to &s;ee her, as &s;he had opportunity, and apprehended it might be proper and decent.</P>
<P>BUT what is &s;till more wonderful, tho' but in her 17th year, &s;he was enabled in the mid&s;t of tormenting pains, and the near views of approaching death, to cor|rect the exce&s;&s;ive &s;orrow of her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed parents: mind|ing them of the &s;overeignty of God; and from the con|&s;ideration that all things are ordered by him, recommending to them the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. And in various ways, &s;he more than once endeavoured to calm their grief, compo&s;e their &s;pirits and bring them to a willingne&s;s to re&s;ign her up to the God who had given her to them.</P>
<P>SHE was in the beginning of her &s;ickne&s;s, and for &s;ome time, under darkne&s;s and fear; and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, if it might be God's will, of living &s;till longer in the world. But for many days before her death, &s;he had a comfortable &s;en&s;e of her Intere&s;t in CHRIST; a good hope thro'
<PB N="19" REF="003518_0024_0FF85573DD2351F0">
his merits of future glory and immortality; and was freely willing to depart hence to be here no more. And <HI>this</HI> &s;he declared upon &s;everal occa&s;ions. Once, upon her Mother's di&s;covering her grief under the view of parting with her, and asking her whether &s;he was willing to die and leave her; Her an&s;wer was, <HI>Yes, yes:</HI> and added, <HI>tho' you have been a loving tender mother to me, I can at God's call readily for&s;ake all to go to</HI> CHRIST. At another time, recovering from a fainting-fit, and over-hearing &s;ome body &s;ay they tho't &s;he was gone; &s;he pre&s;ently cried out, <HI>O that I had gone then! It would have been happy with me now.</HI> Some time after being ask'd, whether her faith and hope held out; &s;he reply'd, <HI>Yes, yes:</HI> doubling the word. And a lit|tle before her death, being de&s;ired to &s;uffer her mouth to be moi&s;tned, which was almo&s;t &s;corched up with a can|ker; &s;he &s;aid <HI>no; for I am going where I &s;hall no more want drink.</HI> And not long after, in a holy calm and ble&s;&s;ed &s;e|renity of &s;oul, &s;he <HI>fell a&s;leep in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY the parents of &s;uch a child!&mdash;You have infinite rea&s;on to magnifie and adore this di&s;tingui&s;hing rich grace of God:&mdash;Nor &s;hould you think hardly of God for taking from you, one &s;o dearly beloved; when he fir&s;t did &s;o much for her, in making her meet for heaven|ly happine&s;s: In the enjoyment whereof, we tru&s;t &s;he is now &s;olacing her &s;elf. Comfort your &s;elves herewith.&mdash;And O! be excited to the greate&s;t diligence in working out your own &s;alvation; that you may hereafter come to be where &s;he is to behold her face in glory, and never be again parted from each other.</P>
<P>IN FINE, <HI>my hearts de&s;ire and prayer to God</HI> now <HI>is;</HI> that there may be, in <HI>this Church,</HI> many &s;uch in&s;tances of an early conver&s;ion <HI>to God!</HI> We tru&s;t there are &s;ome &s;uch: Alas! that they are &s;o rare!&mdash;The good Lord increa&s;e their number!&mdash;O our young people! We are the hope of this Church of our Lord Je&s;us. It's increa&s;e; it's glory; it's very continuance in being is in a mea&s;ure dependant on us. If we &s;hould ri&s;e up in our father's &s;tead, a generation that know not God; what is like to become of the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> wor&s;hip and ordinances in this place?&mdash;I would wil|lingly believe, the brea&s;ts of many of us are warmed with a generous concern for the honor of God and perpetuating re|ligion,
<PB N="20" REF="003518_0025_0FF855760E6418E8">
when our father are dead and gone. Let us then give our hearts to God;&mdash;&s;eek FIRST his kingdom and righteou&s;ne&s;s;&mdash;repent of our &s;ins;&mdash;believe in Chri&s;t;&mdash;and yield up our &s;elves ab&s;olutely and intirely to him, in an everla&s;ting covenant. And O! let us this day chu&s;e our fathers God for our God, and know and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind: So &s;hall we re|joyce the heart of God's people; yea, we &s;hall cau&s;e joy all over heaven: making glad not only the holy An|gels, but God him&s;elf and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But thus much for the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> in my text.</P>
<P>II. THE other thing ob&s;ervable is, the <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to this que&s;tion; <HI>By taking heed thereto according to thy word.</HI> And here are two things, which the time will allow me to give you only a few broken hints upon.</P>
<P>I. IF we would become truly religious, we mu&s;t <HI>take heed to our way.</HI> i. e. We mu&s;t not live at random; without care or caution: but mu&s;t advi&s;e with our rea&s;on &amp; con&s;|cience; make a pau&s;e before we act, and not enter upon any cour&s;e heedle&s;ly; without tho't or con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THIS is a fault too common, e&s;pecially among young per&s;ons: who are therefore particularly here directed to guard again&s;t it. And this, not only becau&s;e 'tis in it &s;elf a gro&s;s incon&s;i&s;tency; for what &s;ounds more incongruous? a <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>intelligent,</HI> yet <HI>tho'tle&s;s</HI> and <HI>incon&s;iderate</HI> crea|ture.&mdash;But becau&s;e 'tis a means nece&s;&s;ary to our being pre&s;erved from the pollutions of &s;in. 'Tis very much ow|ing to that <HI>giddy tho'tle&s;sne&s;s</HI> which is &s;o exceeding apt to prevail among young people, that they are &s;o often led a|&s;tray in the path of wickedne&s;s, that terminates in de&s;tructi|on And unle&s;s we take care to rectify this temper, and recover a &s;eriou&s;ly tho'tful, cautious and con&s;iderate di&s;|po&s;ition, there will be great hazard of our <HI>never</HI> becoming truly religious.&mdash;Con&s;ideration is the fir&s;t &s;tep mention'd in <HI>David'</HI>s return to God and his duty.&mdash;And if with him we would <HI>turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies,</HI> we mu&s;t as he did, fir&s;t <HI>think of our ways.</HI></P>
<P>LET us reali&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of becoming &s;eriou&s;ly con|siderate.&mdash;Let us not allow our &s;elves to live without tho't;
<PB N="21" REF="003518_0026_0FF8557898DB72F8">
as tho' we were not endowed with the noble powers of rea&s;on and under&s;tanding:&mdash;But let us u&s;e our &s;elves to deliberate before we act.&mdash;And let us review our pa&s;t actions: and <HI>often</HI> bring them under &s;trict examination&punc; So will there be a hopeful pro&s;pect of our being kept within the line of duty; or otherwi&s;e, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee our mi&s;take, be likely to repent of it, and alter our cour&s;e, before we get into <HI>a habit</HI> of doing evil.</P>
<P>II. WE mu&s;t take heed to our way, <HI>according to God's word.</HI>&mdash;And this al&s;o is a proper &amp; wi&s;e direction in order to our becoming truly religious. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE word of God is the <HI>be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;utable rule, by which to govern our &s;elves in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion.</HI> One great rea&s;on that young per&s;ons e&s;pecially, are &s;o often found walk|ing in a wrong way is, their not having &s;ettled in their minds <HI>a rule,</HI> by which to govern their conduct; and not u&s;ing them&s;elves to bring their actions to &s;ome <HI>&s;tandard,</HI> to judge of them whether they are good or bad.&mdash;'Tis therefore a good direction, the propo&s;ing to us a <HI>rule of life,</HI> and to <HI>go|vern</HI> our &s;elves by this rule. And the direction is &s;till more wi&s;e &amp; &s;utable, as the rule it recommends is <HI>the word of God;</HI> which is the be&s;t that can be. We have the excelling pro|perties of this rule elegantly de&s;cribed, in P&s;al. 19. 7, 8, 9. <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul; the te&s;timony of the Lord is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple; the &s;tatutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: the fear of the Lord is clean, en|during for ever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righte|ous altogether.</HI> Nor was the world ever favour'd with &s;o clear and perfect a rule of life, as that we have in <HI>the word of God.</HI>&mdash;We are here taught the whole of our duty both towards God, our &s;elves and one another; and this, as it ought to be practi&s;ed in every relation, and under all the varying conditions and circum&s;tances of life: in&s;omuch that if we follow <HI>this direction;</HI> making <HI>the word of God</HI> the rule of our actions, doing whatever <HI>that</HI> pre&s;cribes, and nothing that it di&s;approves of; we &s;han't fail of keeping our &s;elves free from &s;in, and exerci&s;ing our &s;elves in all religious &s;ervices to the honor of God, and our own e&s;tabli&s;hment in grace and goodne&s;s.&mdash;To take heed to God's word as <HI>a rule of life,</HI> is therefore good advice;&mdash;a better direction could &s;carce have been given us.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="003518_0027_0FF8557AFAF00B10">
2. THE word of God offers the <HI>mo&s;t powerful arguments to prevail with us to engage in a religious cour&s;e.</HI> For they are in &s;hort, nothing le&s;s than the <HI>rewards</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hments</HI> of the <HI>eternal</HI> world. The&s;e &s;anctions of the law of God, were not I am &s;en&s;ible, at the time when <HI>David</HI> gave the advice in my text, &s;o fully and clearly expre&s;&s;ed as they have been &s;ince: Yet had good men in tho&s;e days <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> rea&s;on, from divine revelation, to expect a future &s;tate of eternal ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s; and the impenitently wicked, to <HI>dwell with devouring fire, and to inhabit everla&s;ting burnings.</HI> But however it was then, the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has <HI>brought life and im|mortality to light;</HI> and immortality both of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. "It has &s;cattered all tho&s;e clouds that hid the other world from our &s;ight; and removed all doubt concerning the future exi&s;tence both of good &amp; bad men. The kingdom of heaven is now laid open to our view with all the glories of it: Hell al&s;o is repre&s;ented naked, and de|&s;truction without a covering." And what powerful argu|ments are the&s;e? And what are all other motives in com|pare with them?&mdash;They are certainly, in the wi&s;e&s;t manner adapted to work upon our <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>fear;</HI> the two <HI>&s;trong|e&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>leading</HI> pa&s;&s;ions of humane nature: And their operation is &s;o powerful, that if the <HI>fear of eternal mi&s;ery</HI> will not affrighten us from &s;in; nor the <HI>hope of eternal hap|pine&s;s</HI> encourage us to enter upon a life of &s;erious godline&s;s, we are &s;unk into the depth of &s;tupidity.&mdash;More powerful arguments can't be us'd with us; and if we won't be wro't upon by the&s;e, our ca&s;e is truly lamentable.</P>
<P>Now this al&s;o obviou&s;ly ju&s;tifies the wi&s;dom of the direction in my text. For we &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of very &s;trong and forcible arguments to prevail with us, to engage in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion: and <HI>the&s;e</HI> which the <HI>word of God</HI> offers, are the mo&s;t &s;o of any that can be us'd with us.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN the la&s;t place, the word of God is <HI>a mo&s;t powerful means to purify the heart, and beget and increa&s;e in the &s;oul, the principles of holine&s;s.</HI> It has a &s;trong <HI>natural</HI> tendency to the&s;e ends; as it contains that in it, which is mo&s;t &s;uted to en|lighten the mind; inform the under&s;tanding; convince the judgment; per&s;wade the will; move the affections, &amp; &s;tir up the executive powers.&mdash;But its <HI>chief</HI> efficacy to pro|mote
<PB N="23" REF="003518_0028_0FF8557D47747280">
more real piety, lies in its being an <HI>in&s;tituted means</HI> of God's di&s;pen&s;ing tho&s;e <HI>divine a&s;&s;i&s;tances,</HI> that are nece&s;&s;ary to our being truly religious. Upon this account e&s;pecially, the Go&s;pel is called the <HI>power of God to &s;alvation;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1. 16.</NOTE> And our Saviour makes that prayer,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 17. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Sanctifie them thro' thy truth: thy</HI> WORD <HI>is truth:</HI> And we are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;ancti|fy'd and cleans'd with the wa&s;hing of water, by the</HI> WORD.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5. 26.</NOTE> All which texts do abundantly point out the <HI>word</HI> to be <HI>one &s;pecial means,</HI> that is ordinarily made u&s;e of in the work of recovering &s;inners to God and duty. I deny not but the holy Spirit may convert per&s;ons without means: but in&s;tan|ces of this kind are very uncommon, if there be any &s;uch at all. And as the Spirit generally makes u&s;e of means; &s;o the <HI>word,</HI> both red and preach'd, is a &s;pecial means to this end. And perhaps there are few per&s;ons, who have pa&s;&s;ed under a work of regenerating grace, but from their own experience are able to &s;ay, the <HI>word</HI> has been in|&s;trumental herein; and can tell what parts of it in parti|cular, were impre&s;&s;ed upon their minds by the good Spi|rit of God.</P>
<P>AND now, when they holy <HI>p&s;almi&s;t</HI> was about directing young men in the way to religion and happine&s;s; what more &s;utable and effectual method could he advi&s;e to, than this of paying a due regard to <HI>God's word?</HI> &s;ince this is <HI>naturally</HI> adapted to promote this de&s;ign; and is the very method in which it plea&s;es God <HI>ordinarily</HI> to be&s;tow renew|ing, &s;aving grace. What more likely way can be taken, to become &s;incerely pious, than by attending to <HI>that</HI> word, which God has in&s;tituted as a means, which he has given us the greate&s;t encouragement to hope, he will ble&s;s to this end?&mdash;None &s;ure, may be tho't to be under a more hopeful pro&s;pect of a real thorow conver&s;ion, than tho&s;e who put them&s;elves in the <HI>pre&s;cribed way</HI> of meeting with divine grace, by <HI>heedfully</HI> regarding <HI>God's word.</HI></P>
<P>AND now from what has been &s;aid,</P>

SUCH de&s;erve a <HI>&s;evere reproof,</HI> who treat the word with <HI>neglect;</HI> &s;eldom or never looking into it, &amp; making little or no more u&s;e of it than if they had no concern with it.&mdash;This is the character of multitudes, as is too evident from the <HI>gro&s;s ignorance</HI> of &s;ome in the great points of chri&s;tianity; and the <HI>wretched carele&s;sne&s;s</HI> of others, about eternal concerns.&mdash;O be admoni&s;hed of your &s;in and folly! You are greatly guil|ty before God; ca&s;t horrid contempt on his grace;&mdash;and not only &s;o, but hurt your own &s;ouls, and lo&s;e one of the be&s;t advantages in order to your being happy for ever.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. WE &s;hould be <HI>much in reading</HI> the word; having our <HI>&s;tated</HI> times herefor, and not allowing our &s;elves <HI>ordinarily</HI> to pa&s;s a day, without repairing to it.&mdash;And while we are &s;tudying the word, we &s;hould guard again&s;t a light, vain and trifling frame of &s;pirit, as no ways becoming the importance of the duty; but &s;hould endeavour to compo&s;e our &s;elves to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, getting our minds into a tho'tful con&s;iderate temper.&mdash;This doubtle&s;s is a likely method of reading the word to &s;aving advantage.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. WE &s;hould <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> attend on the <HI>preached</HI> word; ma|king it our care to be always at the place of publick wor&s;hip, at the &s;tated times herefor on <HI>Lord's days;</HI> and on <HI>other days</HI> al&s;o, as our occa&s;ions will permit.&mdash;Nor &s;hould we content our &s;elves <HI>meerly</HI> with an attendance on the word: but &s;hould take heed how we hear; and attend with reverence, and an awaken'd &s;en&s;e of the awful weight of future &amp; eter|nal concerns: with de&s;ires of and aims at being &s;piritually profited; that we may be quickned in duty and &s;trength|ned to the performance of it; that we may get po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;anctifying grace, and have it increa&s;ed in our &s;ouls; and in a word, that the life of God may be begun, maintained and carried on in us as much as may be to perfection.&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. IN FINE, let us make u&s;e of the word to the <HI>purpo|&s;es of religion,</HI> for which it is here pre&s;cribed. I will &s;up|po&s;e we are, at lea&s;t &s;ome of us, convinced of the rea&s;on|ablene&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="003518_0030_0FF85581B88DBCC8">
and nece&s;&s;ity of an <HI>early</HI> cour&s;e of piety, and are accordingly re&s;olved to enter upon &s;uch a cour&s;e: And for our direction, let us as the <HI>p&s;almi&s;t</HI> has advi&s;ed, <HI>take heed to our way according to God's word.</HI>&mdash;We have here the great rule of all religion: Let us compare our pretences to ver|tue and goodne&s;s herewith, and not &s;atisfy our &s;elves with any thing &s;hort, of that which the Go&s;pel allows to be pure and undefiled religion.&mdash;We have here the mo&s;t powerful motives, and are laid under the &s;tronge&s;t obliga|tions to a pious holy life: Let us herefrom learn our duty, and fetch our encouragements; quickning our &s;elves in the way of godline&s;s, from tho&s;e con&s;iderations which are here propo&s;ed to us.&mdash;We have here one &s;pecial means the holy Spirit makes u&s;e of, in converting &s;inners to God: Let us attend to it as &s;uch, humbly waiting and hoping for the manife&s;tations of <HI>that power</HI> to our &s;alvation, whereby Je|&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>was rai&s;ed from the dead.</HI>&mdash;In a word, as the Scriptures are profitable to all &s;aving purpo&s;es, and every way &s;ufficient to make <HI>the man of God perfect,</HI> and <HI>throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works;</HI> let us u&s;e them accordingly. Let all our views, all our hopes, all our encouragements and dependances in and from religion, be regulated by the word.&mdash;And let us from the beginning of our lives, and thro' the whole cour&s;e of them, under all the changes of time and various di&s;tributions of providence, govern our hearts, and order our walk according to the Go&s;pel di|rections; and we &s;han't fail, <HI>thro' the &s;upply of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> of being built up in faith and holine&s;s, till we become po&s;&s;e&s;s'd <HI>of an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</HI></P>
<P>THE good Lord now touch our hearts with a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things! and cau&s;e that <HI>that grace of his which hath appeared to all men, bringing &s;alvation;</HI> may effectually <HI>teach us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world:</HI> So may we with comfort <HI>look for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> to whom, with the <HI>Father</HI> and the holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> be eternal prai&s;es.
