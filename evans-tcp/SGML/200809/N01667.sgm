<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Sermons</HI> Emitted herewith, are very mean, plain, ordinary <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> like others of the &s;ame Au|thor. They that have Sermons Pub|li&s;hed by me Fifty Years ago, if they compare them with the&s;e Compo&s;ures, will find them to be of the &s;ame &s;train. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have from my Youth effected a Plain, Scriptural way of Preaching. So have I lived, and &s;o let me dye.</P>
<P>I have been very much urged, &amp; by many, to Publi&s;h a con&s;iderable Number of Di&s;cour&s;es on tho&s;e <HI>Eight Characters of a ble&s;&s;ed Man</HI> (commonly called the <HI>Beatitudes)</HI> in Christs admirable Ser|mon on the Mount. But I mu&s;t Pray my Friends not to be troubled at my not complying with their importunity in that matter; Unle&s;s &s;ome One that has the Pen of a ready Writer &s;hall tran&s;cribe Notes taken in &s;hort hand (whom I can|not per&s;wade to &s;pend time in &s;o un|profitable an undertaking) I am not able to do it. Forty Years ago, I could
<PB REF="001981_0003_0FBA4831F9BFEF80">
Preach every Week, and a Monthly Lecture, &amp; Print many Sermons, &amp; &s;ome other Books which co&s;t me more Reading &amp; hard Study than the Preaching of many Sermons would have done. I can|not do now as once I could. I find a difference between Forty Years of Age and almo&s;t Four&s;core. I have cau&s;e to admire the Mercy of GOD, that at &s;uch an Age I am able (by the help of Chri&s;t) to attend Publick Labours (al|tho' not &s;o frequently as in my Youth) in &s;o large a Congregation as that where the Divine Providence has cast my lot, &amp; carryed me through more than &s;ix &amp; fifty Years Temptations &amp; Difficulties. I have great rea&s;on with thankfulne&s;s unto Chri&s;t, to acknowledge the continu|ed Love of the Lords People. May I be Serviceable among them whil&s;t in the World, &amp; leave tho&s;e things with them, which &s;hall be for their Edification, when I &s;hall be gone to that World, where of Later Years I have longed to be.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON, I. True Believers on Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall have Ever|la&s;ting Life in Heaven.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN, VI. 47.</BIBL>
<P>Verily, Verily I &s;ay unto you, He that believeth on me, hath everla&s;ting Life.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this Chapter, we have the Hi&s;tory of a Miracle wrought by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in feeding five thou&s;and Men with only five loaves and two &s;mall fi&s;hes. The Jews were much affected with the Miracle, &s;o as that they de&s;igned to take him by force and make him a King. Where|upon he withdrew from them, and privately cro&s;&s;ed the Sea (or Lake) of <HI>Tiberias,</HI> and went over to <HI>Caparnaum.</HI> The next day a great Multitude followed him thither, which
<PB N="2" REF="001981_0005_0FBA48369B43F330">
they did not that they were convinced by the Miracles (altho' that was enough to con|vince them) that he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> nor out of any love to his Per&s;on or to his Doctrine, but out of love to the Loaves. Chri&s;t reproved them, and exhorted them to mind Earthly things le&s;s, and Spiritual things more; the Meat which endures to E|verla&s;ting Life, which he would give them, and not that which peri&s;heth. Wherefore Chri&s;t Preached an <HI>admirable Sermon,</HI> con|cerning the Bread of Life, that Bread which if a Man eateth of it, he &s;hall not die but live for ever. There are e&s;pecially two par|ticulars contained in his Sermon, <HI>viz.</HI> A Declaration what is meant by the Bread of Life, and who they are that eat that Bread. He gives them to under&s;tand that He him|&s;elf is that Bread, and that Believers are they that eat that Bread. It is by Faith that the Souls of Men feed upon Chri&s;t, and are made partakers of Eternal Life. This is a&s;|&s;erted by Chri&s;t in the Words before us, with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity. He pronoun|ceth it with a double <HI>Verily,</HI> or as it is in the Original, <HI>Amen,</HI> importing the great|e&s;t certainty. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI> I &s;ay unto you, I who am the <HI>Amen,</HI> the faithful and true witne&s;s, who never did nor can &s;peak an untruth, I &s;ay unto you, <HI>He that believeth on me hath Everla&s;ting Life.</HI> If Chri&s;t is the Bread of Life, and Faith is a feeding on him, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the Belie|ver
<PB N="3" REF="001981_0006_0FBA483809AF1870">
&s;hall have Everla&s;ting Life. By Life happine&s;s is ment. The happy Life is not to be enjoyed in this, but in another World, not Earth, but Heaven is the World where Everla&s;ting Life is to be had.</P>
<P>The Doctrine then before us, is,
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> That the True Believer on Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall mo&s;t certainly enjoy Everla&s;t|ing Life and Happine&s;s in Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrine may be Opened and Con|firmed in &s;everal Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>In Faith there is implyed an</HI> A&s;&s;ent <HI>of the Understanding to the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and a</HI> Con&s;ent <HI>of the Will to ac|cept of Chri&s;t as offered in the Go&s;pel.</HI> This I take to be a true and a clear de&s;cription of Faith. It is the Soul that Believeth and clo&s;eth with Chri&s;t. Lam. 3.24. <HI>The Lord is my portion &s;aith my &s;oul.</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> is of|ten called the <HI>Heart</HI> in the Scripture, Rom. 10.10. <HI>With the heart man believeth unto righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Then both the Under&s;tanding and the Will of the Believer are given to Chri&s;t, the&s;e being the two e&s;&s;ential faculties of a Rea&s;onable Soul.</P>
<P N="1">I. Faith implies a work of God on the Under&s;tanding inlightning it, and cau&s;ing an <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> to the great Truths of the Go&s;pel. It implies a giving Credit to divine Te&s;ti|mony.
<PB N="4" REF="001981_0007_0FBA48408E879EA8">
It is expre&s;&s;ed in the Scripture by a <HI>full a&s;&s;urance of Under&s;tanding,</HI> Col. 2.2. The Believer does not only think that the my&s;tery of the Go&s;pel is Truth, but He is &s;ure of it. Hence <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaking in the Name of all true Believers, &s;ayes, <HI>We believe and are &s;ure that thou art that Chri&s;t the Son of the living God,</HI> Joh. 6.69. There mu&s;t be Knowledge in the <HI>Head</HI> or there will not be Faith in the <HI>Heart.</HI> No Man will believe in an Unknown Chri&s;t. Joh. 10.38. <HI>That you may know and believe.</HI> Yea, Knowledge is &s;o E&s;&s;ential to Faith, as that Faith is &s;ometimes called Knowledge, I&s;ai. 53.11. <HI>By his Knowledge. i. e.</HI> by the knowledge of him, <HI>my righteous Servant:</HI> it is Chri&s;t the Righteous, who is there called Gods righteous Servant, <HI>&s;hall ju&s;tify many.</HI> It is by Faith that many are ju&s;tified. In &s;pecial the Believer giveth a full <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> to that great Truth of the Go&s;pel, that the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is come, and that our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is He. Chri&s;t &s;aid to <HI>Martha,</HI> who|&s;oever liveth, and believeth in me &s;hall never die: Believe&s;t thou this? She &s;aid unto him, yea, Lord, <HI>I believe, that thou art the Christ, the Son of God that &s;hould come into the World,</HI> Joh. 11.27. He believeth what the Go&s;pel reveals concerning the Per&s;on of Chri&s;t: That he is God and not Man only, but God and Man in One Per&s;on. And he believes the Truth relating to the Office of Chri&s;t, that there is One <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us: And the Truth
<PB N="5" REF="001981_0008_0FBA484295AEA8C0">
which concern Chri&s;ts State of Humiliation and Exaltation. That he dyed, and was made a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People, and ro&s;e again the third day, and is a&s;cended to Heaven, and is at the right hand of God, Angels being made &s;ubject to him, and will come again at the la&s;t day to Judge the World. That Man that does disbelieve or deny any one fundamental Article of the Chri&s;tian Religion, cannot be a true Belie|ver on Chri&s;t. But altho' the Faith of <HI>A&s;|&s;ent</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary, it is not alone a Saving Faith. For many Hypocrites and Repro|bates have it. There were chief Rulers a|mong the Jews of whom it is &s;aid that they believed, but they did not confe&s;s their Faith, <HI>For they loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God,</HI> Joh. 12.42, 43. That decla|red them to be no true Believers. For there is not a true Believer in the World that loves the prai&s;e of Men (though they may love it too much) more than the prai&s;e of God. Moreover, their declining to make a Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, di&s;covered their want of a Saving Faith. For with the heart Man be|lieveth, and <HI>with the Mouth Confe&s;&s;ion is made to Salvation.</HI> If a Man will not <HI>Confe&s;s</HI> Chri&s;t before all the World, that's a &s;ure &s;ign that his heart doth not truly believe on him. Believers in the Primitive times would o|penly Confe&s;s the Name of Chri&s;t, when they knew they &s;hould die for it immediately. It is related concerning one of the Martyrs,
<PB N="6" REF="001981_0009_0FBA4844186F66D0">
That the Per&s;ecutors could obtain no An&s;wer to their Interrogatives, but <HI>I am a Chri&s;tian.</HI> Where doe&s;t thou live? <HI>I am a Chri&s;tian.</HI> Who are thy Relations? <HI>I am -a Chri&s;tian.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, that a Man &s;hould &s;ay, I am <HI>Lutheran,</HI> or I am a <HI>Cal|vani&s;t,</HI> or I am an <HI>Epi&s;copalian,</HI> or I a <HI>Pre&s;|beterian</HI>; or of this or that Party: but it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould &s;ay, and confe&s;s it freely, <HI>I am a Chri&s;tian.</HI> Since then, &s;ome that have been convinced of Chri&s;ts being the Son of God, yet have not confe&s;&s;ed him, that &s;hews that a meer doctrinal Faith is not a Saving Faith. Nay, &s;uch a Faith is no more than what the Devils and Damned have. To tho&s;e that have only a Faith of A&s;&s;ent, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Jam. 2.19. <HI>Thou believest there is one God, thou do&s;t well, The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</HI> All Religion depends upon this Article of it, <HI>There is a GOD, and but One GOD.</HI> Deny that and you de&s;troy all Religion at once. Where|fore when it is &s;aid, The Devils believe there is One God, it imports that they be|lieve all the Articles of Religion. In par|ticular they believe that Great Article of our Chri&s;tian Faith, That Je&s;us of Nazareth is the Son of God whom he had promi&s;ed to &s;end into the World. We read in the Go&s;pel of a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Man, that when the Devils in him &s;aw Chri&s;t, they made a &s;ad out cry, <HI>Saying, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Je&s;us of Nazareth, are
<PB N="7" REF="001981_0010_0FBA48465AE75C10">
thou come to de&s;troy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy One of God.</HI> So that this Be|lief is not enough to denominate any One a true Believer in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. In Faith there is implied the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> of the Will. Believers are Chri&s;ts People. And his People are a <HI>Willing People,</HI> P&s;al. 110.3. In this does Believing e&s;pecially con&s;i&s;t. Hence Faith is &s;aid to be not a believing <HI>Of</HI> Chri&s;t, but a Believing <HI>On</HI> him. So in the Text before us. And Believing <HI>In</HI> him, Joh. 11.25. <HI>He that believeth</HI> in <HI>me though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live.</HI> And there are many other Expre&s;&s;ions whereby Faith is denoted in the Scripture which imply a <HI>Con&s;ent of the Will.</HI> e. g. It is di&s;|cribed by a willingne&s;s to come to Chri&s;t for Life and Salvation. Chri&s;t &s;aid to the unbelieving Jews, <HI>You will not come to me that you might have life,</HI> Joh. 5.40. Un|belief is a <HI>departing</HI> from Chri&s;t. So 'tis by Faith that we go to him for Salvation. When &s;ome fal&s;e hearted Di&s;ciples were &s;o offended at &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Chri&s;ts Sermon, as to go back and walk no more with him, Chri&s;t &s;aid to his true Di&s;ciples, Will you al&s;o go away? <HI>Peter</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>Lord to whom &s;hall we go, Thou ha&s;t the words of Eternal Life,</HI> Joh. 6.68. Thy words which teach us to believe on thee will bring us to Eternal Life, therefore we will go to thee and to no one el&s;e for it. Faith is
<PB N="8" REF="001981_0011_0FBA484899AEF380">
expre&s;&s;ed by that of <HI>Tru&s;ting</HI> in the Lord, in which is implied a <HI>Con&s;ent of the Will,</HI> and a <HI>Resting</HI> on him, and a <HI>Leaning</HI> on him. Cant. 8.5. <HI>Who is this that comes up from the Wilderne&s;s Leaning on her beloved.</HI> It is the Believer that comes out of the Wilder|ne&s;s of this World, and Leans upon Chri&s;t all the Way in his Journey towards Heaven. Again, Faith is called Obedience. <HI>He is the Author of Salvation to all that obey him,</HI> Heb. 5.9. It is not a forced but a willing Obedience. I&s;ai. 1.19. <HI>If ye be willing and obedient, you &s;hall eat the good of the Land.</HI> They that are willingly obedient to Chri&s;t &s;hall eat the good of the heavenly Land, they &s;hall eat the bread of Life there. Moreover, <HI>Believing</HI> is &s;aid to be a <HI>Receiving of Chri&s;t.</HI> Joh. 1.12. <HI>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> A Man that has a gift offered to him, if he is convinced of the worth of it, he receives it with both hands willingly. Chri&s;t is the greate&s;t gift that po&s;&s;ibly can be. God him&s;elf has not a greater gift to be&s;tow than that of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In the Go&s;pel he offers him to Sinners to be their Saviour. They that <HI>Receive</HI> him as God offers him, are the Believers that &s;hall have Ever|la&s;ting Life. The true Believer <HI>Receives</HI> him <HI>with</HI> his heart, and in his heart. Chri&s;t &s;ayes, <HI>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the
<PB N="9" REF="001981_0012_0FBA484B4DA0A9A8">
door, I will come in to him and will &s;up with him and he with me,</HI> Rev. 3.20. What door is that which Chri&s;t &s;tands knocking at? It is at the door of the Sinners heart. Chri&s;t &s;ays, Open that door, that I may come in. The Believer &s;ays, I will do it with all my heart. Come in ble&s;&s;ed Lord, Take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this heart of mine, Dwell there and rule there for ever; And ca&s;t out of my heart what ever &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to thee. I give to thee, and to none but thee my heart. The Believer that thus heartily receives Chri&s;t, &s;hall &s;up with him, &s;hall fea&s;t with him upon the bread of Life in Heaven.</P>
<P>To &s;peak more particularly:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Believer receives Chri&s;t in his Per|&s;on as a mo&s;t de&s;irable One. 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>To you which believe he is precious.</HI> Not on|ly in his benefits precious, but He him&s;elf is &s;o. God offers his Son to Men to be their Head and Saviour, that their Souls &s;hould be Married to him, Matth. 22.2. <HI>A King made a Marriage for his Son.</HI> The God of Heaven is the King there &s;poken of. Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is his Son. It is the be|lieving Soul that is Married to him; yea, the Soul takes him not meerly for his Por|tion, but for the excellency and de&s;irable|ne&s;s of his Per&s;on. Not for his Loaves, but becau&s;e his Miracles have convinced him
<PB N="10" REF="001981_0013_0FBA484D6636E9C8">
that he is the Son of God, and &s;o the mo&s;t excellent Per&s;on that ever was in the World. The dark Unbeliever never had his eyes opened &s;o as to have real vi&s;ions of the glory of Chri&s;t. The language of Unbe|lief is that, in I&s;ai. 53.2. <HI>He has no form nor comline&s;s, and when we &s;hall &s;ee him, there is no beauty in him that we &s;hould de|&s;ire him.</HI> But as for the true Believer the Spirit of God has opened his eyes, and &s;hi|ned into his heart, and has given him to &s;ee the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He therefore &s;ayes of Chri&s;t, He is my beloved, and my beloved is the chief of ten thou&s;and. There is no Man on Earth nor in Heaven neither that is &s;o de&s;irable in his eyes as Je&s;us Chri&s;t. P&s;al. 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> He does then mo&s;t willingly receive him.</P>
<P N="2">2. He receives Chri&s;t, as in his Per&s;on, &s;o in all his Offices. He does not only believe that Chri&s;t is a Prie&s;t, a Prophet and King, but is willing that Chri&s;t &s;hould be his Prie&s;t, his Prophet, and his King. It is true that the Prie&s;tly Office of Chri&s;t is in a &s;pecial manner the object of Faith. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. 3.25 <HI>Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Pro|pitiation through faith in his blood.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t the glorious <HI>High Prie&s;t of our</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> has offered a Sacrifice to God to make Atonement for the Sins of
<PB N="11" REF="001981_0014_0FBA4853A3DAD928">
his People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to obtain for them the forgivene&s;s of all their Sins, and the Salvation of their Souls. Now that Sacri|fice which Chri&s;t has offered, is Him&s;elf. He is both Prie&s;t and Sacrifice. His hu|mane Nature which was Sacrificed being Per|&s;onally united to the divine Nature, that Sacrifice was infinitely greater than if all the Creatures in the whole World had been a Sacrifice to appea&s;e the wrath and &s;atis|fie the Ju&s;tice of God, for the wrong done to him by the Sins of Men. It was &s;uf|ficient to make Atonement for the Sins of the whole World. Were it not for the Merit of the blood of that Sacrifice, the Be|liever would have no Faith nor Hope of ever &s;eeing Heaven. Heb. 10.19. <HI>Having boldne&s;s to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Je&s;us.</HI> He dare venture to &s;ay, If there is not Merit enough in the blood of Je&s;us to obtain my Salvation, I am content to peri&s;h. But &s;ince there is &s;uch a great High Prie&s;t as <HI>Je&s;us the Son of God</HI> to be his Saviour, the true Believer on him &s;hall never peri&s;h. Thus does he receive Chri&s;t in his Prie&s;tly Office. He al&s;o receives and &s;ubmits unto him in his Prophetical Office. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid to the Children of I&s;rael, <HI>A Pro|phet will the Lord your God rai&s;e up unto you like unto me, him &s;hall you hear in all things what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto you, and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that every &s;oul that will not hear that Prophet &s;hall be destroyed.</HI> Chri&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="001981_0015_0FBA4854D808BD90">
is that Prophet, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> declares in one of his Sermons which he Preach|ed in the Temple, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.22. The <HI>Believer</HI> is called a <HI>Comer</HI> to Chri&s;t: Joh. 6.35. <HI>He that comes to me &s;hall never hunger, he that believeth on me &s;hall never thirst.</HI> He comes to Chri&s;t to be taught by him, as a Scholar comes to his In&s;tructor. Hence Believers are called <HI>Di&s;ciples.</HI> Again, the Believer receives Chri&s;t as King. There are many that would have Chri&s;t to be their Saviour who are not willing that he &s;hould be their Ruler, But Believers &s;ay of Chri&s;t, <HI>He is our Lawgiver, he is our King, he will &s;ave us.</HI> As &s;uch He is received by the true Be|liever.

Phil. 3.8, 9. Al&s;o, corrupt &s;inful &s;elf mu&s;t be denyed.

Joh. 5.44. <HI>How can you be|lieve which receive honour one of another?</HI> If a Man is under the dominion of a Lu&s;t of Ambition, how can he believe? So if he is under the power of a Lu&s;t of Wantonne&s;s, or a Lu&s;t of Drunkenne&s;s, or of any other Lu&s;t, that he will rather venture the lo&s;s of his Soul, and Eternal Life, than part with that Sin, how can he believe. The true Believer is heartily willing to part with all his Sins. It is &s;aid of the wi&s;e Merchant, that <HI>he &s;old all that he had for the Pearl of great price,</HI> Matth. 13.46.

<P N="1">1. There is a <HI>Negative Unbelief</HI>; which they that never had the Go&s;pel Preached to them, are &s;ubject unto. Rom. 10.14. <HI>How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher?</HI> Thus it is with the greate&s;t part of Mankind, poor peri&s;hing Creatures, they &s;it in darkne&s;s, and in the Region of the &s;hadow of death. What a dreadful Scrip|ture is that, in P&s;al. 9.17. <HI>The wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> forget God.</HI> But this &s;ort of Unbelief, none that hear me this day are concerned in. The Go&s;pel has been Preached, and <HI>the Great Sal|vation</HI> offered to every Soul among us.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>Po&s;itive Unbelief,</HI> which is a di&s;obedience to the Calls of the Go&s;pel. This Unbelief is the mo&s;t damning Sin that ever any Man has been guilty of. Joh. 3.19. <HI>And this is the Condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkne&s;s ra|ther than light.</HI> Chri&s;t is the mo&s;t glorious

light that ever came into the World, but Men prefer Sin before Him. This brings them under the heavie&s;t Condemnation that po&s;&s;ibly can be. The Unbeliever is not as yet Executed, but he is Condemned. Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI> And what Puni&s;hment is he Condemned unto? To nothing le&s;s than death. And what death? A death not of the body only, but of the Soul; He is Condemned to &s;uffer the pains not of the fir&s;t death only, but of the <HI>Second Death.</HI> What is the Second Death? Rev. 21.8. <HI>The Unbelieving &s;hall have their part in the Lake which burns with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI> And that which makes it to be a death indeed, is the <HI>Ever|lastingne&s;s</HI> of it. The thought of it is ama|zing. De&s;pairing <HI>Spira</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If I were to be in Hell but for a thou&s;and Years, methinks it might be endured, but when I think of Eternity, I am amazed</HI> Ah! Woful Unbeliever, if thou were told that thou &s;hould&s;t be in Ex|qui&s;ite Torments for a few Years, how would it a&s;toni&s;h thee? But will it not affect thee, that GOD Him&s;elf declares to thee, that if thou per&s;i&s;t in thy Unbelief, thou &s;halt be in Endle&s;s and Ea&s;ele&s;s Mi&s;eries, in Tor|ment the Smoke whereof &s;hall a&s;cend for ever and ever. For the Lords &s;ake Con&s;ider of it before it is too late. Know it of a cer|tainty, That Unbelievers who have di&s;o|beyed the Go&s;pel, will fall under the &s;adde&s;t Sentence, at the la&s;t day, of any Sinners

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTHEW, XXII. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King, which made a Mar|riage for his Son.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the former part of this Chapter, we have a Parable, the de&s;ign whereof is to intimate that the Jews would reject Chri&s;t the Promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and that therefore they them&s;elves &s;hould be re|jected from being the Church and People of God, and that the Gentiles &s;hould become his People, and that among them, many &s;hould be the Subjects of an External Call,
<PB N="50" REF="001981_0053_0FBA48CB28325438">
and that &s;ome (tho' but a few) would be the Subjects of an internal and effectual Call.</P>
<P>The words before us to in&s;i&s;t on are a Similitude or Parable in which there is.</P>
<P N="1">1. The thing compared, Namely the King|dom of Heaven. By the Kingdom of Hea|ven here we are to under&s;tand <HI>the Church of God</HI>; E&s;pecially under the heavenly di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. The Church is a King|dom and an heavenly Kingdom. It is under the Government of a heavenly King, and ruled by heavenly Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is that unto which this King|dom of Heaven is compared, Namely, to a King that made a Marriage for his Son; by the King under&s;tand the God and King of Heaven, and by his Son our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Marriage fea&s;t &s;po|ken of in the Parable, has re&s;pect to the benefits of Chri&s;t which are preferred to Sin|ners in the Go&s;pel on condition of their con&s;ent to the Marriage.

<P><PB N="51" REF="001981_0054_0FBA48D2160D2440">Three Propo&s;itions will clear the Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That Believers while in this World are Married to Christ the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>There is the Initiation and the Con&s;um|mation of this Marriage. The Initiation of it is in this World. As &s;oon as a Man does believe his Soul is Married to Chri&s;t. The Apo&s;tle therefore &s;ayes to the Corinthians 2 Cor. 11.2. <HI>I have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one Hus|band, that I may pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;t Virgin unto Chri&s;t.</HI> The great work of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel is to bring Souls to Chri&s;t; to woo and win Souls to Chri&s;t, therefore called the <HI>Friends of the Bridegroom,</HI> Joh. 3.29. The Truth before us is Evident.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture does declare that there is a Spiritual Conjugal Relation between the Lord and his People. Jer. 3.14. <HI>I am Mar|ried to you, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> I&s;ai. 54.5. <HI>Thy Maker is thy Husband, the God of the whole Earth &s;hall he be called.</HI> That Implies that his Church &s;hall be among the Gentiles; that he would be not only the God of the Jews, but of the Gentiles al&s;o. The Lord directs his Church to call him <HI>I&s;hi,</HI> the Eng|li&s;h of which word is, <HI>My Husband,</HI> Ho&s;. 2.16. And Chri&s;t calls his Church, <HI>His Spou&s;e,</HI> Cant. 4.10. And the Church is cal|led, <HI>The Lambs Wife,</HI> Rev. 21.9.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="52" REF="001981_0055_0FBA48D6CC2519B0">2. This holy Truth was My&s;teriou&s;ly &s;ig|nifyed by &s;everal Types which did Figura|tively repre&s;ent it to us. As now, The Mar|riage God made between <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> was a Type of this. Eph. 5.32. <HI>They two &s;hall be one fle&s;h; this is a great Mystery, but I &s;peak concerning Christ and the Church.</HI> That Mar|riage had a My&s;tery in it as re&s;pecting the Relation that is between Chri&s;t and the Church. <HI>Adam</HI> was ca&s;t into a deep &s;leep, and <HI>Eve</HI> taken out of him and given to him&punc; Chri&s;t has been ca&s;t into the deep &s;leep of death, and by means of this the Church is produced. And Solomons Marriage was a Type hereof. The <HI>Song of Songs</HI> is an <HI>Epitha|lamium,</HI> in Prai&s;e of Chri&s;t and his Church. It was the manner among the Jews, that when Per&s;ons of Quality were Married they had Songs in Prai&s;e of the Bride|groom and the Bride. The <HI>Song of Solomon,</HI> is &s;uch an One; it &s;hews forth the Prai&s;es of Chri&s;t and his Church: And the XLV. P&s;alm is like it. Solomon Married <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Daughter who was a Gentile, and thereby was &s;ignified that Chri&s;t &s;hould be Married to the Gentiles, that is, have his Church among them. P&s;al. 45.10. <HI>O Daugh|ter forget thy own People and thy Fathers hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If we con&s;ider the things that are re+qui&s;ite in order to conjugal Relation, we &s;hall &s;ee that there is a ble&s;&s;ed Marriage be+tween Chri&s;t and his Church. <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Fathers Con&s;ent is requi&s;ite there
<PB N="53" REF="001981_0056_0FBA48E1B92F7720">
unto. God Con&s;ents that his Son &s;hould be Married to his Church. He has made this ble&s;&s;ed Match; wherefore, the Text &s;ayes. <HI>A King made a Marriage for his Son.</HI> We Read of the Marriage Fea&s;t, as provided by him, which implies his Con&s;ent. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 4. <HI>I have prepared my dinner,</HI> &s;ays the King. God has given his Son to his Church to be the head thereof. I&s;ai. 9.6. <HI>Unto us a Son is given, his Name is called Wonderful, the Prince of Peace.</HI> So he has given his Church to Chri&s;t, as Chri&s;t to them. Chri&s;t there|fore &s;aid, Joh. 17.9, 10. <HI>I pray for tho&s;e that thou ha&s;t given me: All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</HI> It is God that per&s;wades and draws the Souls of his Elect to Chri&s;t. Joh. 6.44. <HI>No man can come to me except the Father draw him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) Another thing requi&s;ite in Marriage is the Con&s;ent of the Per&s;ons concerned therein. Tho' their Parents be never &s;o willing to the Match, if the Parties concer|ned do not Con&s;ent to take each other, there can be no conjugal Relation. Chri&s;t has con&s;ented that his Church &s;hould be &s;o re|lated to him: He has given him&s;elf <HI>for</HI> his Church, and given him&s;elf <HI>to</HI> them, and owns them to be his in the mo&s;t peculiar Relation. Cant. 8.12. <HI>My Vineyard is mine,</HI> &s;ayes Chri&s;t. As for Believers, they are mine &s;ayes Chri&s;t. And as Chri&s;t has given him|&s;elf to his Church, &s;o Believers have given them&s;elves to him. 2 Cor. 8.5. <HI>They gave
<PB N="54" REF="001981_0057_0FBA48E2ECE79B00">
them&s;elves to the Lord.</HI> A true &s;aving Faith does con&s;i&s;t in this very thing e&s;pecially, when a Man gives him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, as his Lord and Saviour, to be his as his only, and his for ever; that is a &s;aving Faith. Chri&s;t &s;ayes, <HI>Give me thy heart</HI>; the Believer &s;ayes, My heart thou &s;halt have with all my heart. This Mutual Con&s;ent between Chri&s;t and the Believer, we &s;ee in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 45.12. It is &s;aid of the Kings Daughter, <HI>The King &s;hall greatly de&s;ire thy beauty. He is thy Lord, and wor&s;hip thou him.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That the ble&s;&s;ed Marriage be|tween the Son of God and the Believer, will be Compleated at the la&s;t day.</HI></P>
<P>It was cu&s;tomary among the Jews, that Married People were fir&s;t E&s;pou&s;ed, and then they were e&s;teemed Husband and Wife; and in due time the Marriage was compleated. In this Life Believers are E&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t. At his Second coming will be the Con&s;um|mation of the Marriage. Chri&s;t will then come as a Bridegroom. Matth. 25.5. <HI>The Bridegroom is come, go ye out to meet him.</HI> Then the Church of Chri&s;t is every way &s;ui|table for him, bedeck'd with Grace &amp; Glory, and all Sin and Imperfection taken away. Rev. 10.7. <HI>The Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife has made her &s;elf ready.</HI> It will be &s;o at the la&s;t day, then the Church will have on all her Ornaments. I&s;ai. 61.10.
<PB N="55" REF="001981_0058_0FBA48E40D166B08">
<HI>Covered with a Robe, with the garments of Sal|vation, as a bride adorneth her &s;elf with her Jewels.</HI> Then the Church will appear a glo|rious Church indeed. Eph. 5.27. Chri&s;t will <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> her a <HI>glorious Church without &s;pot or wrinkle or any &s;uch thing.</HI> Then comes the ble&s;&s;ed Marriage Supper. Rev. 19.9. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that are called to the Marriage &s;upper of the Lamb.</HI> This ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is intimated to Believers when they come to the Lords Table. Luk. 22.29, 30. <HI>I appoint to you a Kingdom</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t) <HI>You &s;hall eat and drink with me at my Table in my Kingdom; You &s;hall fit upon thrones.</HI> This is &s;ignified and repre|&s;ented to Believers in this holy Ordinance, of the Lords Supper. At the la&s;t day Chri&s;t and his Church will be together and live to|gether, and never more be &s;eparated for &s;o much as one day: they &s;hall ever be with the Lord. Rev. 21.2, 3. <HI>New Jeru&s;alem comes down from God our of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her Husband: And the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he &s;hall dwell with them.</HI> Chri&s;t who is God &s;hall dwell with them: They &s;hall be with Chri&s;t during the di&s;pen&s;ation of the la&s;t Judgment, which will not be as many imagine a day of Twenty-four hours only, but doubtle&s;s will continue a long time. Eminent Divines &s;uppo&s;e it will la&s;t for a thou&s;and Years. And all that time Be|lievers &s;hall be with Chri&s;t; and after that they &s;hall go to Heaven together. The Hus|band and Wife dwell together in the &s;ame
<PB N="56" REF="001981_0059_0FBA48E58596D4F8">
Hou&s;e: So it &s;hall be with Chri&s;t and his Church, they &s;hall dwell together in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and it will be in his Fathers Hou&s;e, which is &s;uch a glorious Palace as Mortal eye never did behold the like. Joh. 14.2, 3. <HI>Many Man&s;ions are in my Fathers hou&s;e. I go to prepare a place for you, and will come again and receive you to my &s;elf, that where I am you may be al&s;o.</HI> So &s;hall they dwell to|gether in his Fathers Hou&s;e throughout the never ending days of Eternity.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That the Relation between Chri&s;t and his Church will abide for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed is the only Marriage that can|not be di&s;&s;olved. As for all Earthly Rela|tions, Death di&s;&s;olves them.

<P>Several things may be mentioned, which declare the happine&s;s of Believers by rea&s;on hereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. There can be no Law-&s;uits again&s;t them. <HI>Urori lis non intenditur.</HI> The Hus|band is re&s;pon&s;ible for his Wives debts. The Wi&s;e can't be Sued as long as her Husband liveth. So is the ca&s;e here. The debts which we owe, Chri&s;t has undertaken the payment of. He has &s;uffered to make &s;atisfaction to God for all our Sins, which are our debts. God has imputed them to him, becau&s;e he became our Surety, and promi&s;ed to make Satisfaction for all we did owe to the Ju&s;tice of God. Accordingly God has charged Chri&s;t with all the debts of his People. I&s;ai 53.6. <HI>Upon him was laid the Iniquity of us all.</HI> Therefore Ju&s;tice will not come up|on them, will not demand &s;atisfaction of the Surety, and of the Principal too. Rom. 8.33, 34. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</HI> What? have they not been guilty of many Sins? Yea, but God Ju&s;tifies for all that, <HI>Who &s;hall condemn? It is Chri&s;t that dyed, yea rather that is ri&s;en again:</HI> which implies that God has received full &s;atisfacti|on in the death of his Son. Chri&s;t is come out of the Pri&s;on of the Grave, and God has thereby declared Him&s;elf fully Satisfied.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="61" REF="001981_0064_0FBA490475699580">2. Believers thus related to Chri&s;t &s;hall be protected and defended again&s;t all their Enemies. Chri&s;t their Husband will be their Protector, and happy are they in ha|ving &s;uch a Protector. It was &s;aid to <HI>Sarah,</HI> That Abraham her Husband &s;hould be a <HI>Cove|ring to her Eyes. h.c.</HI> A vail to defend her from injuries, <HI>Gen.</HI> 20.16. So Chri&s;t defends his Church.

<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e of their Relation to Chri&s;t, Believers are &s;ure to be well provided for. He is able to provide well for them: They &s;hall never want for any thing &s;ince Chri&s;t is their Head and Husband. They &s;hant want Clothing, they &s;hall have the be&s;t Robe given to them. In <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.1. We read of <HI>a Woman clothed with the Sun.</HI> Who is that Woman but the Church of Chri&s;t? What is that Sun with which &s;he is cloathed, but the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t? Chri&s;t is <HI>the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> They &s;hant want for Food. I&s;ai. 25.6. <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts has pre|pared a fea&s;t of fat things, and of wines well refined on the lees.</HI> And what will Chri&s;t feed his People with? He will feed them with Manna, with the bread of Heaven. What is that bread Chri&s;t gives? It is the bread of Life. Bread which if a Man eat thereof,

<P N="4">4. Since Believers are Married to Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t and all that belongs to him is theirs. They have an Intere&s;t in his Per&s;on: They are his and He theirs. <HI>My beloved is mine and I am his,</HI> Cant. 2.16. And they have an Intere&s;t in his E&s;tate; all the E&s;tate that belongs to Chri&s;t, belongs to them. Rom. 8.17. <HI>They are heirs of God and joynt heirs with Chri&s;t.</HI> A Kingdom is the greate&s;t Riches: Believers on Chri&s;t are heirs of a ble&s;&s;ed Kingdom And more than &s;o, by rea&s;on that the Inheritance of Chri&s;t is theirs, all things are theirs; for what is that Inheri|tance? it is no le&s;s than all things: He is &s;aid to be <HI>the heir of all things.</HI> Is it not &s;aid of Believers, <HI>That they &s;hall Inherit all things</HI>?

It is Infinite Con|de&s;cention in him to look on the highe&s;t Angel in Heaven.

<P>In the words before us we have, (1.) The Duty to be done, &s;cil. <HI>To hear the Voice of Chri&s;t</HI>; which intends Obedience. Often in the Scripture to <HI>Hear</HI> is to <HI>Obey. Hear</HI> (i. e. Obey) <HI>and your Souls &s;hall live.</HI> (2.) The time when this ought to be done, <HI>To day.</HI> It may not be deferred until to Morrow, but mu&s;t be done <HI>To day.</HI> The Doctrine before us, is,
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> That Men ought not only to hear the Voice of CHRIST &s;o as to Obey Him, but it is of Infinite Concernment for them to do it, To Day.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrine may be Opened and Confir|med in &s;everal Propo&s;itions.</P>
<Q><HI>PROP. I.</HI> There are many in the World, whom the Lord is plea&s;ed to favour with a Day of Grace.</Q>
<P><PB N="73" REF="001981_0076_0FBA493CACE8A4A0">When it is &s;aid, <HI>To day</HI> hear his Voice, that is intended, hear the Voice of Chri&s;t while&s;t you have a day of Grace vouch&s;a|fed to you for that End.

And <HI>a &s;pace to Repent.</HI> Such a day Sinners who are gone out of this World are not favoured with. Altho' the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking con|cerning the damned Souls of the Sinners who lived in the Old World before the flood, &s;ayes, That the Spirit of Chri&s;t Preached to <HI>the Spirits in Pri&s;on,</HI> which were &s;ometimes di&s;obedient in the days of Noah, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.19. the meaning is not, that he Preached to them after they were in Pri&s;on, <HI>i. e.</HI> in Hell, but before that while&s;t they were living; the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the Mini&s;try of Noah, Preached Repentance to them. But not|with&s;tanding it is a Truth that no Sinners in the other World have a <HI>Day of Salvation</HI> vouch&s;afed to them, neverthele&s;s, there are &s;ome in this World that have &s;uch a day.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>There are many that Enjoy the light of the Go&s;pel</HI>; which is the ordinary <HI>Medium</HI> by which God works Grace in the Souls of Men, and &s;o brings them unto Eternal Sal|vation by bringing the Go&s;pel to them,
<PB N="74" REF="001981_0077_0FBA494230065790">
which is called, <HI>The Go&s;pel of our Salvation,</HI> Eph. 1.13. As for &s;uch as have not the light of the Go&s;pel, they have no <HI>Day,</HI> 'tis always Night with them; they &s;ee no light but &s;it in darkne&s;s and in the region of the &s;hadow of death. But as for &s;uch as have the Go&s;pel, 'tis <HI>Day</HI> with them. The Sun is ri&s;en upon them, even <HI>the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which has healing under his wings,</HI> Mal. 4.2. There was a time when for many Ages only one Nation had the light of Gods Word &s;hining upon them; and they had but Moon light Comparative|ly. <HI>He &s;hewed his Word to Jacob, he hath not dealt &s;o with any Nation.</HI> That ble&s;&s;ed light &s;hined but on a little &s;pot of ground, not two hundred Miles; as to the re&s;t of the World, darkne&s;s covered the Earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the People. But &s;ince Chri&s;t has come into the World, many parts of the Earth have been enlightned with the Go&s;pel. 1 Joh. 2.8. <HI>The darkne&s;s is past, and the true light now &s;hines.</HI> The knowledge of Chri&s;t, which the Go&s;pel brings to the World is truly light, and the mo&s;t glori|ous light that ever &s;hone on the Earth. Now they that Enjoy the Go&s;pel have a Day of Grace and Salvation offered to them. For the Go&s;pel offers Grace wherever it comes. It is the Grace of God that brings Salvati|on, and has appeared to all Men. The Go&s;|pel proclaims the Mercy of Heaven to Sin|ners on the Earth. Chri&s;t then declares to
<PB N="75" REF="001981_0078_0FBA4943A5C26D78">
them, that there Sins &s;hall be forgiven and their Souls &s;aved, if they will <HI>hear his Voice.</HI> It makes a free offer of Life to Con|denmed Sinners; yes to all that come with|in the hearing of it, if they will accept of it on gracious Go&s;pel termes. Rev. 22.17. <HI>Who&s;oever will let him take the water of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The ble&s;&s;ed God does not only offer Sal|vation to Sinners, but he waits with wonder|ful Patience to &s;ee whether they will accept of the Grace offered. He endureth with much long-&s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath,</HI> Rom. 9.22. He extends his Patience to <HI>Long-&s;uffering,</HI> nay, to <HI>much</HI> Long-&s;uffering. It is from In|finite Grace in God that be makes an offer of Salvation to Sinners; &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould do it but once, and then de&s;troy them upon the fir&s;t refu&s;al: but the Lord renews his offers of Grace and Mercy, and continues to do &s;o, from day to day, nay, he waits Petiently for Years one after another, and &s;till finds him&s;elf di&s;appointed. Luk. 13.7. <HI>The&s;e three years I came &s;eeking fruit and find none. Life Time</HI> in this World is a <HI>Day of Grace.</HI> It is Compared to the Day, as death is re&s;embled to the Night: <HI>Night comes when no man can work.</HI> Men may do things in the <HI>Day Time,</HI> while they have light for what they do, which they cannot when the dark Night has overtaken them. So while&s;t they Enjoy <HI>the Light of the Living</HI> they may be working about their Salvation
<PB N="76" REF="001981_0079_0FBA49472D8F9300">
which when in the dark Grave they cannot. <HI>There is no work in the Grave whither thou art going.</HI> There are &s;ome Sinners which Live three&s;core, yea, it may be four &s;core Years, or more, and all that time the Lord has waited to be gracious to them. He has &s;pread out his hands, with a Scepter of Grace in them, to Rebellious ones, and that has he done <HI>all the Day,</HI> as long as they had a Day to live on this Earth. Thus it was with the Sinners of the Old World, they lived an hundred and twenty Years under the awakening Mini&s;try of <HI>Noah,</HI> who was a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; there was the Voice of Chri&s;t &s;peaking to them in that Mini&s;try, but they regarded it not; never|thele&s;s, for <HI>&s;o long a time</HI> did the Lord lengthen out the days of his Patience. Of this the Apo&s;tle takes notice, 1 Pet. 3.20. <HI>Who &s;ometimes were di&s;obedient when once the long &s;uffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing.</HI> When the Children of I&s;rael were in the Wilder|ne&s;s, they continued in their Rebellious Practices for the &s;pace of Forty Years; God was Patient and Long-&s;uffering to them all that time, notwith&s;tanding their not <HI>hear|ing his Voice</HI>; wherefore it is &s;aid in the next words following my Text, <HI>Harden not your hearts as in the provocation, and as in the day of Temptation in the Wilderne&s;s, when your Fathers tempted me, proved me and &s;aw my works, forty years long was I grieved with

this Generation.</HI> The like Patience did the Lord Exerci&s;e towards the Jews after the Go&s;pel had been Preached to them by the Son of God him&s;elf, and by his Apo&s;tles. Chri&s;t indeed threatned them with a de|&s;olation of their City and Temple, and that the means of Grace &s;hould be taken from them, yet did he continue the Go&s;pel to them forty Years after they had rejected it.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>When Men</HI> (<HI>a particular Per|&s;on or People</HI>) <HI>are favoured with &s;pecial ad|vantages to be attending the work of their Eternal Salvation, that is their day.</HI></P>
<P>The Day of Grace does not con&s;i&s;t meerly in the allowance of Time, or a Space to Repent, and &s;eek the face and favour of God, but in having &s;pecial Advantages for it. To &s;peak more particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Day of Pro&s;perity is a day of Grace.</HI> Often in the Scripture a time of Adver&s;ity is denoted by darkne&s;s and night; it is Wi&s;|dom for Men to mind the concerns of their Souls before that Night overtake them. Jer. 13.16. <HI>Give Glory to the Lord your God before he cau&s;e darkne&s;s, and before your feet &s;tumble on the dark Mountains.</HI> Says the Prophet, ere long you will be carried over the dark Moun|tains into Captivity; give Glory to God by Repentance before that darkne&s;s comes upon you. <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to the Princes of I&s;rael,

<P N="2">2. <HI>The</HI> Chri&s;tian Sabbath <HI>is a Day in which Men have &s;pecial advantages to be promoving their Souls Good and Salvation: Wherefore they &s;hould hear the Voice of Christ therein.</HI> It is called <HI>the Lords Day,</HI> Rev. 1.10. Since it is <HI>Chri&s;ts Day,</HI> He will make it a ble&s;&s;ed day to &s;uch as &s;hall then hear his Voice. P&s;al. 518 24. <HI>This is the day which the Lord

hath made.</HI> He has made it, that &s;o we might wor&s;hip him on that Day as our Redeemer. For the &s;pace of four thou&s;and Years from the Creation the <HI>Seventh day</HI> of the Week was the Day of &s;olemn Wor&s;hip, in Commemoration of God, His re&s;ting on that Day from the Work of Creation; but the <HI>Fir&s;t Day</HI> of the Week is the Chri&s;tian Sabbath in Commemoration of our Saviour Chri&s;t his ri&s;ing from the dead on that day, and &s;o re&s;ting from the Work of Redemption then fini&s;hed. The Lords Day has been a Day of Salvation to many a Soul; indeed to the generality of Gods Elect. Among the Lords Ancient People, when there was to be a &s;olemn Fea&s;t, a Silver Trumpet was to be &s;ounded which called the People together.

<P N="3">3. <HI>There are Times when the Holy Spirit &s;trives with Sinners, that is their</HI> Day of Grace.
<PB N="80" REF="001981_0083_0FBA4953ACB30610">
It was the Spirit of Chri&s;t that did &s;trive with the Sinners of the Old World before the flood, and then they had a ble&s;&s;ed day of Grace, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18, 19. but they did not <HI>hear his Voice in that their day.</HI> When Sin|ners turn out of the way in which they &s;hould go, they oft hear a Voice behind them &s;aying, <HI>This is the way walk in it,</HI> I&s;ai. 30.21. The Voice of Chri&s;ts Word and Spirit directs them into the right way. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hear it, and obey it. There are <HI>Saving Operations</HI> of the Holy Spirit on the Souls of the Elect. There are al&s;o <HI>Common Operations</HI> thereof in the Hearts of Reprobates, by which Chri&s;t is &s;peaking to them, and &s;triving with them, and Grace is offered to them. Sometimes the Holy Spirit &s;trives by great Illuminations in the Mind. Some have proved total and final Apo&s;tates, and Com|mitted the Unpardonable Sin; <HI>Who were once Enlightned, and have ta&s;ted of the hea|venly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have ta&s;ted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come,</HI> Heb. 6.3, 4. Sometimes the Holy Spirit &s;trives with Sinners by Convincing them of their Sin and Mi&s;ery, and awakening their Con&s;ciences with di&s;mal fears of a Wrath to come. The Scripture &s;peaks of a <HI>Spirit of Bondage unto fear,</HI> Rom. 8.15 Many a Sinner has Experience of it. He hears that he has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Law of God, and is bound over to the Great A&s;&s;izes. He is
<PB N="81" REF="001981_0084_0FBA495514EDE130">
afraid of Death and Hell. O what will be|come of me in another World to all Eter|nity! Would he hearken to the Voice of Chri&s;t in the&s;e Convictions, it may be they Would i&s;&s;ue in Conver&s;ion and Salvation. There was &s;omething of this <HI>Spirit of bondage unto fear</HI> in <HI>Felix,</HI> when he heard <HI>Paul</HI> Preach an awakening Sermon concerning Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and Temperance, and Judgment to come, <HI>Felix Trembled,</HI> Act. 24.25. Happy had he been, if he had obeyed the Voice of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the&s;e Convictions and Terrors of his Con&s;cience. Sometimes the Holy Spirit &s;trives with the hearts of Sin|ners in cau&s;ing good Affections to be &s;tir|ring in them: but they have quenched the holy fire which the holy Spirit has kindled in them. It may be at times they have wept at Sermons, and it may be at times have received the Word with Joy. Nay, they have been &s;o affected as <HI>almo&s;t</HI> to re|&s;olve to for&s;ake their Sins, and to become Chri&s;tians indeed. Was it not &s;o with <HI>Agrippa?</HI> He was <HI>almost per&s;waded</HI> to be a Chri&s;tian, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.28. Yea, many times the Holy Spirit &s;trives with Sinners, &s;o as to cau&s;e a great Reformation in them, and yet no thorough &s;aving work upon them. They have been &s;wept and garni&s;hed, and the Un|clean Spirit has gone out of them for a time, but afterwards Seven Devils have entred for One before, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.45. They have e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World through the

He lived under <HI>John Bapti&s;ts</HI> powerful Mini&s;try, heard him gladly, and <HI>did many things,</HI> Mark 6.20. Now when the Spirit of God is at work in the hearts of Sinners, altho' but with a Com|mon and not a &s;aving Work, they are great|ly concerned to hear the Voice of Chri&s;t, that &s;o the work may prove &s;aving.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Pre&s;ent Time is the Day of Grace.</HI> 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>Behold Now is the accepted time, behold Now is the day of Salvation.</HI> Not here|after, but <HI>Now</HI> If you would be &s;aved hear the Voice of Chri&s;t <HI>Now</HI>; if you would have God accept of you, return to him <HI>Now</HI>: For <HI>Now</HI> is the time, Behold it, behold it. This was the Voice of God by all his holy Prophets; they all with one Voice cried, <HI>Turn ye</HI> NOW <HI>from your evil way.</HI> The Lord does not &s;ay, <HI>To Morrow,</HI> if you will hear his Voice, you &s;hall be &s;aved, but <HI>To Day,</HI> if you will hear his Voice. <HI>Now</HI> or the pre&s;ent Time, is the only time that any Man is &s;ure of.

Gen. 6.3. <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive.</HI> Nor will the day of Patience la&s;t al|ways. The Ju&s;tice of God will not &s;uffer his Patience to be always abu&s;ed.

<P>It is mentioned in the Sermon Emitted herewith, that our very Learned <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> the Aged &amp; Ho|nourable Mr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>Amos 2.11.</HI> delivered many Years &s;ince, at the Lecture in <HI>Cambridge</HI> the day after the <HI>Commencement,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of that which is called <HI>Hu|mane Learning,</HI> to make an able Mini&s;ter of the New-Te&s;tament. Likewi&s;e that Eminent Divine Mr. <HI>Sydrack Symp&s;on</HI> at the Commencement, <HI>Anno 1653.</HI> Preached a Sermon to the &s;ame Effect on <HI>2 King. 6.1, 2.</HI> to the <HI>Univer&s;ity Congrega|tion</HI> in Old <HI>Cambridge.</HI> Al&s;o Mr. <HI>Edward Reyner,</HI> a Reverend &amp; Learned Mini&s;ter of the Congregational Per&s;wa&s;ion, in <HI>Lincoln,</HI> has an Elaborate &amp; Judicious Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hewing that Knowledge in the Liberal Arts and Original Tongues is very nece&s;&s;ary to make an accompli&s;hed Divine.

The Martyr <HI>Tindal</HI> (who has been called the <HI>Apo&s;tle of England</HI>) complains of them for &s;etting up <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> (a Pa|gan, who maintains many damnable Opinions) to be of equal Authority with <HI>Chri&s;t. Melancthon</HI> relates that there was a Preacher in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Tubingen</HI> who took his Text out of <HI>Ari&s;totles Ethicks,</HI> in&s;tead of the Bible.</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e are the Univer&s;ities which our Reformers have Condemned, in which there was no true Religion, nor &s;olid Learning taught, but Heatheni&s;m &amp; Idolatry, with the Rixations of tho&s;e called <HI>Schoolmen</HI> who were much wor&s;e than their Ma&s;ter <HI>Peter Lombard.

In our own Nation how great a ble&s;|&s;ing have the two Univer&s;ities of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> been in the former Ages?

<P>When our Fathers on the account of <HI>Pure Re|ligion and Undefiled,</HI> came into this <HI>Ameri|can De&s;ert,</HI> their care was that Religion might not die with them, or continue but for One Gene|ration. To prevent that, they built a <HI>College,</HI> that a Learned Youth might be Educated under the In&s;pection of a Pre&s;ident and Tutors; which

<P>I rejoyce to &s;ee a peculiar <HI>Talent</HI> put into the hands of One &s;o Qualified &amp; Hopeful as Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI> is, to be Servicable to the Churches of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>IN the Preceding Ver&s;e, the Apo&s;tle declares, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has given to his Church a variety of Mini|&s;ters and Officers. Some that were Ex|traordinary and Temporary, and are long &s;ince cea&s;ed, viz. <HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets, E|vangeli&s;ts.</HI> An Apo&s;tle was one that had &s;een Chri&s;t and received a Commi&s;&s;ion immedi|ately from him. The Prophets here &s;poken of are not the Prophets of the Old, but of the New Te&s;tament; &s;uch as <HI>Agabus,</HI> and &s;ome others mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. An Evangeli&s;t was one that did accompany the Apo&s;tles, and A&s;&s;i&s;t them in Preaching the Go&s;pel. Such were <HI>Mark, Luke, Timothy, Titus, Silas, Apollos,</HI> &amp;c. But be&s;ides the&s;e, Chri&s;t has given to his Church
<PB N="104" REF="001981_0106_0FBA5471F9008F50">
a Mini&s;try which is to be perpetual. A &s;ta|ted &s;tanding Office, Namely that of <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</HI> It is Ob&s;ervable, that it is not &s;aid <HI>&s;ome</HI> Pa&s;tors, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> Teachers, as it was &s;aid <HI>&s;ome</HI> Apo&s;tles, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> Prophets, which &s;eems to intimate that the Pa&s;toral and the Teaching Office are the &s;ame. Every Pa&s;tor is to be a Teacher, and every Teacher that is &s;o in re&s;pect of Office is to feed his Flock, and is in that re&s;pect a Pa&s;tor. In this Ver&s;e the Work of the Mini&s;try is de&s;cribed from that which is the principal end of it. Some &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Trajection</HI> in the words, and that the Ver&s;e runs thus. <HI>For the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the perfecting the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chri&s;t.</HI> That's the End for which Chri&s;t has in&s;titu|ted the Ordinance of the Mini&s;try. In the next Ver&s;e, The Mini&s;try is de&s;cribed from the duration of it. It &s;hall continue <HI>until we all come into the unity of the Faith.</HI> The Elect of God are di&s;per&s;ed throughout the World in Places very di&s;tant from one a|nother; but the day will come when they &s;hall <HI>all come together,</HI> and then they &s;hall be of <HI>One Faith,</HI> not only as to the Funda|mental Articles of Religion, but in le&s;&s;er points al&s;o. In a future World it will be &s;o, where there will be no need of a Mini&s;try, and until then, it &s;hall continue. From the Words in Con&s;ideration with the Context, the Doctrinal Truth before us, is,
<Q><PB N="105" REF="001981_0107_0FBA54741EBED980"><HI>DOCT.</HI> That there are &s;ome, whom the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t gives to his Church, for the Work of the Mini&s;try; and there &s;hall be &s;uch to the End of this World.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrine contains Three Propo&s;itions.</P>
<Q>PROP. I. <HI>The Ministry is a Work.</HI></Q>
<P>The Scripture gives it that Name. When <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were to be <HI>Ordained Prea|chers</HI> of the Go&s;pel to the Gentiles, the holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, Separate them <HI>for the Work</HI> where|unto I have called them. And a divine Work it is. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Timothy, He work|eth the work of the Lord, as I al&s;o do,</HI> 1 Cor. 16.10. On which account it is that a &s;in|gular re&s;pect is due to tho&s;e that are &s;o em|ployed. 1 The&s;. 5.13. <HI>E&s;teem them very highly in Love for their works &s;ake.</HI> A work which cannot be done without Labour. 1 Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let Elders that rule well, be coun|ted worthy of double honour, e&s;pecially they</HI> who Labour <HI>in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> That double honour intends, an honourable Main|tenance; therefore in the next Ver&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>The Labourer is worthy of his reward.</HI> Indeed the Labour of the Body is not &s;o much in this as in &s;ome other Callings; but the Labour of the Mind is that which is the mo&s;t Con&s;uming; the Labour of the head and heart is mo&s;t tire&s;ome. Therefore <HI>Solo|mon</HI>

&s;ayes, <HI>Much &s;tudy is a wearine&s;s of the fle&s;h,</HI> Eccl. 12.12.</P>
<P>The Enquiry now will be, <HI>What it the Work of the Mini&s;try?</HI> What is the Work which the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are to be employ|ed about?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. <HI>Their &s;pecial Work is to Watch over Souls.</HI> Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the rule over you, for they watch for your Souls.</HI> Wherefore their work is difficult and awful, for they mu&s;t give an account of all the Souls which are committed to their care and charge. <HI>Cura Animarum,</HI> a charge of Souls is dreadful. For if any one of tho&s;e Souls mi&s;|carry through the Mini&s;ters negligence or unfaithfulne&s;s, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for it. Their blood will be required at his hand. Ezek. 33.6. <HI>His blood will I require at the Watchmans hands.</HI> Who is that Watchman? Ver&s;e 7. <HI>Son of Man, I have &s;et thee a Watchman to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; thou &s;halt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me; if thou dost not &s;peak to warn the wicked from his ways, he &s;hall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I re|quire at thine hand.</HI> Who can think of ha|ving the blood of Souls layed to his charge, without trembling at the thought of it?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A principal Work belonging to a Mini&s;ter of God, is, to Endeavour the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners.</HI> They are called <HI>the Bridegrooms friends,</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="001981_0109_0FBA547EADE1A6B8">
Joh. 3.29. Chri&s;t is the Bridegroom, his Mini&s;ters are &s;aid to be his Friends; for it is their work to woo, and if po&s;&s;ible to win Souls for Chri&s;t. King <HI>David</HI> was not an ordinary Mini&s;ter, neverthele&s;s a Mini&s;ter of God he was; he was a Prophet, and he &s;ayes, <HI>I will teach Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors thy ways, and Sinners &s;hall be converted to thee,</HI> P&s;al. 51.13. <HI>Levi</HI> did as became his relation, when the law of Truth was in his Mouth, and <HI>he did turn many from iniquity,</HI> Mal. 2.6. As for the Pri|mitive Preachers of the Go&s;pel, this was their main de&s;ign, and God made their La|bours wonderfully Succe&s;sful. Acts 11.21. <HI>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord, Peter</HI> had the Jews for his more peculiar Pro|vince, the Apo&s;tle&s;hip of the Circumci&s;ion was committed to him, and the Lord taught Effectually by him. We read of near upon three thou&s;and Jews Converted by one Ser|mon which he Preached at Jeru&s;alem, <HI>Act.</HI> 2 41. <HI>Paul</HI> endeavoured the Conver&s;ion of the Gentiles; Chri&s;t from Heaven having gi|ven him a Commi&s;&s;ion to that work, &s;aying, <HI>I &s;end thee to the Gentiles to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light and from the power of Satan unto God,</HI> Act. 26.18. And he was an happy In&s;trument of Converting we know not how many thou&s;ands. The Miraculous Succe&s;s of the Apo&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors in Converting the Gentile World was Prophe&s;ied of by <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> who &s;ayes,
<PB N="108" REF="001981_0110_0FBA548293861F88">
That <HI>Fi&s;hers &s;hall &s;tand from</HI> Engedi <HI>even unto</HI> Eneglaim, and &s;pread forth nets, and the fi&s;h taken in the net, would be <HI>exceeding many,</HI> Ezek. 47.10. <HI>Engedi</HI> was at the South-we&s;t end of the dead Sea, <HI>Eneglaim</HI> was at the Nor|ea&s;t end of it; there were to be fi&s;hers from one end of the dead Sea to the other. The dead Sea (the Lake of Sodom) was an em|blem of the Gentile World, who were all dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins. Mini&s;ters are Fi&s;hers. Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, I will make you <HI>Fi&s;hers of Men.</HI> They mu&s;t fi&s;h for Souls, and &s;pread the Net of the Go&s;pel that they may take Souls for Chri&s;t. In all Ages of the World there will be &s;ome to be Converted, which is one rea&s;on why there mu&s;t be Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to the End of the World, becau&s;e in every Age there will be &s;ome to be Converted; and the Mi|ni&s;try of the Word is the ordinary Means of Conver&s;ion. Rom. 10.7. <HI>Faith comes by hear|ing, and hearing by the Word of God:</HI> And it is &s;aid, How &s;hall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? and how &s;hall there be a Preacher except there is one &s;ent? When there are Believers, the Mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t are u&s;ually the In&s;truments by whom they are made &s;uch. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. Who is Paul, &amp; who is Apollos, but <HI>Ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every one.</HI> There are few Congregations but there are &s;ome Unconverted ones therein. It is the
<PB N="109" REF="001981_0111_0FBA5483CC3C1480">
Mini&s;ters duty to apply him&s;elf accordingly. It is a vain Opinion which &s;ome have, that the Pa&s;tor of a Church is only to Endeavour the Edification of Saints, but not the Con|ver&s;ion of Sinners; he ought to do both, as the next words to my Text intimate, <HI>For the Edifying the Body of Christ.</HI> When a Sinner is Converted, the Body of Chri&s;t is Edifyed, there is a New Member added to his Church which is his Body; another living Stone is layed in that Sacred building. And truly what greater Service can any Mini&s;ter, or any Man in the World do for Chri&s;t, than to make tho&s;e that have been &s;laves to Sin and Satan, to become faithful Subjects in Chri&s;ts holy Kingdom, to the Eternal Salvation of their Souls. <HI>He that Converts a Sinner &s;hall &s;ave a Soul from death.</HI> Jam. 5.20. And what can any Man do that will be more for his own Joy &amp; Comfort? I have often thought of a Pa&s;&s;age which a renowned Hi&s;torian re|lates concerning Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> who had been before that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and Lord Keeper, and &s;u&s;tained other Places of Honour and Dignity; when a Mini&s;ter came to him for <HI>Ordination,</HI> he &s;aid to him, <HI>I have pa&s;&s;ed thorough many Places of honour in Church and State, more than any of my Order in</HI> England; <HI>could I be a&s;&s;ured that by my Preaching I had Convered one Soul, I &s;hould have more comfort in that than in all the Honours and Offices that have been bestowed on me.</HI> Without doubt there are &s;ome who
<PB N="110" REF="001981_0112_0FBA54855FBC1988">
will have a greater degree of Glory conferred on them at the la&s;t day, than others &s;hall. Among the&s;e faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t will be found, who have been the happy In&s;tru|ments of Converting many Souls to God. Witne&s;s that ble&s;&s;ed Scripture: Dan. 12.3. <HI>They that be</HI> Teachers (&s;o the Hebrew word. <HI>Hamma&s;chilim</HI> there u&s;ed) <HI>&s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> A <HI>Prophets reward</HI> is mentioned as that which has a Specialty on it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.41.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It belongs to a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel to Endeavour the Spiritual Edification of tho&s;e that are Converted, that they may be built up in their most holy Faith.</HI> It is not enough to Sow the Seed of the Word, but it mu&s;t be watered, then it may be hoped that God will make it fruitful. 1 Cor. 3.6. <HI>I have planted, Apollos watered, God gave the increa&s;e. Paul</HI> was the Planter of a Church in <HI>Corinth.</HI> They were his Converts. He was In&s;trumental in Plan|ting the Seed of Grace in their Souls. He left <HI>Apollos</HI> with them, who continued Prea|ching to them and by tho&s;e waterings built them up in further degrees of Faith and Ho|line&s;s. A Pa&s;tor of a Church mu&s;t endea|vour the Edification of his People, by build|ing them up in Knowledge. It is a &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing when they have a Pa&s;tor furni&s;hed with &s;uch gifts as enable him to do it. Jer. 3.15. <HI>I will give them Pa&s;tors according to my own
<PB N="111" REF="001981_0113_0FBA5486EAA897E0">
heart, which &s;hall feed them with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding.</HI> The Mini&s;try of the Word is appointed, not only that &s;o Grace may be be|gun where it is not, but that they who have Grace, may grow in Grace. 1 Pet. 2.2. <HI>De|&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word that you may grow thereby.</HI> Mini&s;ters mu&s;t Endeavour the Confirmation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Hearers in the truth and holy ways of the Lord. This al&s;o did the Primitive Preachers of the Go&s;pel. <HI>Act.</HI> 14.22. They Preached the Go&s;pel, and taught many, <HI>Confirming the Souls of the Di&s;ciples, Exhorting them to conti|nue in the Faith.</HI> No Man was more Labori|ous herein than the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> He went through <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> in which Places he had Converted many, and gathered Churches, <HI>Confirming the Churches,</HI> Act. 15.41. Some|times the Flocks are in danger by Wolves. Fal&s;e Teachers who bring in damnable Here|&s;ies, are &s;uch. It is incumbent on their Pa&s;tors to defend them again&s;t the cunning Craftine&s;s of the&s;e Men who lie in wait to deceive; and to confirm them, that they may not be carried about with every wind of doctrine. Sometimes Believers meet with &s;ore temptation, by which they are apt to be di&s;couraged: Then a word of comfort may be much to their Edification. <HI>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, &s;peak comfortably to Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It may be a &s;ea&s;onable word from the Mouth of a Pa&s;tor to the tempted in his Flock who &s;it in darkne&s;s and &s;ee no light,
<PB N="112" REF="001981_0114_0FBA548D0E539270">
will have a wonderful reviving Efficacy in it, to &s;trengthen their Faith, and e&s;tabli&s;h their hope in God, who has <HI>Created the fruit of the Lips, Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In order here-unto Mini&s;ters ought to be Diligent and Labourious in Preaching the word of God.</HI> They &s;hould come to their People with well &s;tudied Sermons. 2 Tim. 2.15. <HI>Study to &s;hew thy &s;elf approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth.</HI> As the Prie&s;ts were to divide the Sacrifice that every one might have their &s;hare, &s;o the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t apply Comfort to whom that does belong, and Terror to whom that does belong. He that will &s;how him&s;elf a Workman that needs not be a&s;hamed, mu&s;t &s;tudy for it. There is more than a little contained in that Apo&s;tolical Injunction: 2 Tim. 4.2. <HI>Preach the Word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, and out of &s;ea&s;on. Preach.</HI> The Greek Word <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ignifies to Proclaim like an <HI>Herald,</HI> publickly and with a loud Voice. Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are Chri&s;ts Heralds, they mu&s;t Publickly and Earne&s;tly declare what is the Command of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and <HI>be in&s;tant,</HI> be in good Earne&s;t. The Lord &s;aid to his Prophet, <HI>Cry aloud,</HI> do as becomes an Herald, <HI>Spare not, lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet</HI>; it condemns a cold, dull, lifele&s;s way of Preaching. <HI>In &s;ea&s;on.</HI> If a Mini&s;ter is on a &s;ubject which People are willing to hear of, that's <HI>in &s;ea&s;on</HI>;
<PB N="113" REF="001981_0115_0FBA549077C2D760">
if on a &s;ubject which they have no Mind to hear, that's out of the Sea&s;on to them: but whether they will hear or forbear, the Prea|cher mu&s;t faithfully declare the Me&s;&s;ages which the Lord has &s;ent him with. What is <HI>Preaching?</HI> It is an <HI>Opening, and Applying of the Scriptures.</HI> To &s;earch the Scriptures is every Mans duty, but the Mini&s;ters duty more than any Mans in the World. <HI>Search</HI> them. <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <HI>Miners</HI> do. There are rich Mines, in the Scripture, there is Gold and Pearls in tho&s;e Mines, but we mu&s;t dig and dive that &s;o we may come at them. No Man can be better Employed. Mini&s;ters &s;hould be Ela|borate in their Sermons. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ayes, <HI>The Preacher &s;ought to find out acceptable words,</HI> Eccl. 12.10. Men that come into the Pul|pits, and utter whatever comes next, with|out any Premeditation or Dijudication, do not <HI>&s;eek</HI> to find out acceptable words. There was a Man of &s;ome Name and Fame, who had an unhappy de&s;ign of introducing <HI>Ex tempore</HI> Preaching as well as <HI>Ex tempore</HI> Pray|ing; And being a Learned Man he would make the attempt in the Univer&s;ity Church in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> but the Lord rebuked him. One that was there pre&s;ent informed me that he was at a <HI>Nonplus,</HI> and in perfect confu|&s;ion, Confe&s;&s;ing his ra&s;hne&s;s, and warning the Students not to do the like, but to Study their Sermons before they Preached them. Moreover, Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought not to Preach only Verbally, but by their Lives
<PB N="114" REF="001981_0116_0FBA54917AD09460">
and Conver&s;ations. They &s;hould <HI>Live Ser|mons.</HI> A Mini&s;ter &s;hould be able to &s;ay to his People, as Gideon &s;aid to his Souldiers, He &s;aid to them, <HI>Look on me and do likewi&s;e, it &s;hall be as I do, &s;o &s;hall you do,</HI> Judg. 7.17. Thus &s;hould a Mini&s;ter be able to &s;peak to his People, do not only as I &s;ay, but as I do, ob&s;erve my Life and Practice, and do you Live and Practice as I do, my humane frail|ties Excepted. The Apo&s;tle &s;aid to his Corinthians, <HI>Be ye followers of me,</HI> 1 Cor. 4.15. Followers of my Doctrine, and followers of my Example.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>To be much in Prayer is the Work and Duty of the Mini&s;ters of God in a &s;pecial man|ner.</HI> They are to be as Gods Mouth to his People, &s;o his Peoples Mouth to him. The Prie&s;t was to ble&s;s in the Name of the Lord, and to be offering Incen&s;e daily. The A|po&s;tles &s;aid, <HI>We will give our &s;elves continually to Prayer and to the Mini&s;try of the Word,</HI> Act. 6.4. They that are called to the Mini&s;try of the Word, are to give them&s;elves to Prayer, which implies frequency as well as con&s;tancy therein. Before they Compo&s;e their Ser|mons, they &s;hould Pray over them. Let them Pray Sermons down from Heaven. It is reported of Martyr <HI>Bradford</HI> that he Study|ed Kneeling. And when they have Compo|&s;ed their Sermons they &s;hould Pray over them again, that a ble&s;&s;ing from God may make them Succe&s;sful and Effectual for the good
<PB N="115" REF="001981_0117_0FBA54972C1F93F8">
of Souls. And they have cau&s;e to be much in Prayer for their own Souls, that they may obtain Mercy to be faithful in the di&s;charge of their Mini&s;try. It is a dreadful charge which is impo&s;ed on them. One of the An|cients &s;aith of the Mini&s;try, That it is <HI>Onus humeris Angelicis formidandum,</HI> a charge and burden which the Shoulders of Angels might tremble to come under it. Another Ancient &s;ayes, It is a wonder that a Mini&s;ter &s;hould get to Heaven. Such Mortification to the World, &s;uch Self-denial, &s;uch Impartiality, &s;uch Faithfulne&s;s, &s;uch Exemplary Holine&s;s is re|quired and expected of them, as that it is a wonder that any of that Order &s;hould be Sa|ved. A &s;mall error in &s;uch an one, is great by rea&s;on of the Sacredne&s;s of his Office. Under the Law there was as great a Sacrifice to be offered for the Prie&s;t as for the whole Congregation. Are they not then concerned to be alwayes Praying? It was <HI>Au&s;tins</HI> de|&s;ire, that when the Me&s;&s;enger of Death &s;hould be &s;ent for him, it might find him either Preaching or Praying. Mini&s;ters are to Pray as for them&s;elves, &s;o for and with particular Per&s;ons in their Flock, if they need Prayer and de&s;ire it. Jam. 5.15. <HI>Is any &s;ick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him. Au&s;tin</HI> (whom I mentioned but now) would not refu&s;e to go to the meane&s;t Sick Per&s;on in his Congrega|tion, if they de&s;ired it, but otherwi&s;e he would &s;eldom go to any, becau&s;e he would not
<PB N="116" REF="001981_0118_0FBA549A6EF178A8">
prevent them from doing that which is their duty, <HI>to Call for their Elders,</HI> to Pray over them. And a Pa&s;tor of a Church ought to Pray continually for his whole Flock. 'Tis his duty to bring them to God every Day, and every Night. How is it po&s;&s;ible that that Mini&s;ter &s;hould have Grace in his Soul that can, that dare live one Day or one Night without bringing his Flock to GOD for his ble&s;&s;ing when Praying for his own Soul? The Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;aid, <HI>God forbid that I &s;hould &s;in in cea&s;ing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way,</HI> 1 Sam. 12.23. And truly faithful Mini&s;ters of God may be Encouraged to Pray, for that there is a great Efficacy in their Prayers, their Prayers have a greater power with God than the Prayers of other Men, &s;ince they Pray not only by vertue of the rule of Charity, but <HI>Ex Officio</HI> by vertue of an Office. We find in the Scripture that God has manife&s;ted a Special regard to the Prayers of &s;uch of his Servants. P&s;al. 99.6. <HI>Mo&s;es and Aaron among his Prie&s;ts, and Samuel among them that call up|on his Name; they called upon the Lord, and he an&s;wered them.</HI> Mo&s;es is mentioned among the Prie&s;ts, becau&s;e he did the work of a Prie&s;t before the Prie&s;thood was &s;ettled and confined to Aarons Family, and after that was a powerful Interce&s;&s;or for the People. <HI>Samuel</HI> was a Prophet. We &s;ee that the Lord has a great regard to the Prayers of tho&s;e that are his Prie&s;ts and his Prophets. Wherefore
<PB N="117" REF="001981_0119_0FBA549EC36E6330">
it was &s;aid to <HI>Abimeleck</HI> when he was Sick and in danger of death, the Prayer of a Pro|phet might &s;ave his Life. Gen. 2.7. <HI>He is a Prophet, he &s;hall pray for thee, and thou &s;halt live.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel have a Work to attend, and what that Work is. I might have added, that there is <HI>Suffe|ring</HI> (as well as doing) <HI>Work</HI> which they mu&s;t expect a peculiar &s;hare in. When Per|&s;ecution ari&s;eth they mu&s;t look to be &s;et in fore-front of the hotte&s;t battel. It is the &s;ay|ing of one of the Ancients, <HI>Non e&s;t Minister Chri&s;ti, qui non e&s;t ad mille mortes Paratus.</HI></P>
<P>We proceed to a Second Propo&s;ition, which is,
<Q>That there are &s;ome who are by the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t called to this Work.</Q></P>
<P>When it is &s;aid, That <HI>Chri&s;t has given &s;uch to his Church,</HI> it implies that they have a Call from him to accept of that Office, and to un|dertake the work of it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Re&s;t not in Gifts without Sanctifying Saving Grace.</HI> A Man that has good Natural Parts, and a Strong Memory, may by Reading and Study obtain a <HI>Rare Gift of Preaching,</HI> &s;o as to be admired and applauded and make a great Noi&s;e in the World, but what is it all, if he has not Grace in his Soul? Does not the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, That if he could <HI>Speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, and had the gift of Prophe&s;y, and under&s;tood all Mysteries,</HI> if he had not the Grace of Love to God and Man, he &s;hould be notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e eminent accompli&s;hments, <HI>but as &s;ounding bra&s;s and a tinkling &s;ymbal,</HI> which has a taking &s;ound with it, 1 Cor. 13.1, 2. <HI>Quid prode&s;t e&s;&s;e peritum et periturum.</HI> If a Man &s;hould gain the Applau&s;e of the whole World, what is he advantaged, if he loo&s;e him&s;elf, or be ca&s;t away. Gifts may make a Man u&s;eful to

others, but if they are not Sanctified they will aggravate the Condemnation of the Man that has been adorned with them. Many who helped to build the Ark were drowned in the flood. So many who by Means of their Mini&s;terial gifts have helped to build the Church will peri&s;h Eternally. All the World will &s;ee that this is true at the la&s;t day, when <HI>not a few</HI> but <HI>many</HI> &s;hall &s;ay to Chri&s;t, <HI>Lord, have not we Prophe&s;ied in thy Name, and in thy Name done wonderful works</HI>; and Chri&s;t will &s;ay to them for all that you were workers of iniquity, and therefore depart from me, I know you not, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.23. Oh! remem|ber the awful words of the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 9.27. <HI>Le&s;t that by any Means, when I have Preached to others, I my &s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t away.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When you Enter upon Publick Preaching, Endeavour that your Sermons may be &s;uch as &s;hall be profitable to tho&s;e that hear them.</HI> If you would Preach profitably, you may not Preach your &s;elves, but CHRIST. Young Preachers are apt to make an o&s;tentation of their Parts, and Wit, and Learning, which ought not to be. <HI>Paul</HI> was the mo&s;t Learned of all the Apo&s;tles, but how careful was he not to make any &s;hew of it! Sermons painted with fine Phra&s;es and Flouri&s;hes are like painted Windows which ob&s;cure the light. One &s;ays well, That &s;uch Preachers <HI>put the Sword of the Spirit into a velvet Scabbard, which
<PB N="133" REF="001981_0135_0FBA54D66325DD20">
keeps it from wounding the heart.</HI> If you would Preach profitably, Preach plain Scrip|tural Sermons. Scriptures are the Sinews of a Sermon. Confirm all that you &s;ay with them. It is the Preachers duty to do &s;o: He may not come to the Congregation with Notions of his own, but with the Word of God. 1 Pet. 4.11. <HI>If any &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the Oracles of God.</HI> And if you would Preach profitably, &s;ingle out profita|ble Subjects to Di&s;cour&s;e on; dwell rather on Practical than Polemical Subjects: <HI>e. g. Concerning the Evil of Sin, and Mans Natural Sinfulne&s;s, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of Regene|ration in order to Salvation, and the danger of Hypocri&s;y, and how far Men may go in the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of Religion, and yet fall &s;hort of Heaven at la&s;t. This is a Subject much to be in&s;i&s;ted on, &s;ince there have been and there are Notorious Hereticks who have excelled in a &s;eeming Piety.</HI> But be&s;ure you <HI>Preach JESUS CHRIST and His Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Learned <HI>Scultetus,</HI> ob|&s;erves that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Preach up <HI>Morality,</HI> and Good Works, but not a Word of Ju&s;ti|fication by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and that <HI>Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and other Moral Philo&s;ophers teach as Good Morality as they do. The iniquity of &s;ome <HI>Clergy Men</HI> at this day, who &s;ay, they are Pro|te&s;tants, is very great, &s;ince they have little either of CHRIST, or of Scripture in
<PB N="134" REF="001981_0136_0FBA54D8042C7F28">
their Sermons. Nay, they count it a di&s;|grace to their Sermons, if the Name of Chri&s;t is often mentioned therein. How unlike are &s;uch to that good Old <HI>Predi|cant,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>Si &s;cribas, &s;i conferas, non mihi placet, ni&s;i &s;onuerit ibi Je&s;us.</HI> And how unlike unto the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who in his Epi&s;tles, mentions the Name of Chri&s;t four hundred and fifty times; and in one Chapter (<HI>viz.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.) in 10. ver&s;es, he mentions the Name of Chri&s;t ten times. And he faith to them, That <HI>he determined to know nothing,</HI> that is, to Preach nothing among them but <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.2. The Corinthians were a Polite People, and &s;ome of them no doubt great Scholars; and it might have been thought that among &s;uch a People, he would have come with excellency of Speech and of Wi&s;dom, but he Preached Chri&s;t with all po&s;&s;ible plaine&s;s; His Prea|ching was not with enticing Words of Mens Wi&s;dom. Therefore let us Preach Chri&s;t as becomes the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel. CHRIST is &s;uch a Subject as can never be drawn dry. A Mini&s;ter may Preach of him all his days, and there is more to be &s;aid &s;till. The Truths relating to Chri&s;t Angels de&s;ire to look into. The My&s;tery of his Per&s;on, Office, Humiliation and Exaltation will be the Admiration of Saints and Angels throughout the days of Eternity.

And can we Preach or Hear too much of them now? Our famous Engli&s;h Martyr|ologi&s;t, gave that Advice to his Friend, Brother, <HI>Preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> It was his Complaint that Chri&s;t was not Preached in <HI>England</HI> then, &s;o much as &s;hould be. I wi&s;h he was more Preached there now. It was <HI>Luthers</HI> Comfort when at the point of death, That he could &s;ay to Chri&s;t, <HI>Lord Je&s;us I have Loved thee, and I have Preached thee, into thy hands I com|mend my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If GOD &s;hall be &s;o gracious as to Call you to the Work of the Mini&s;try, make that your Work.</HI> You may not make it to be a <GAP DESC="foreign">, but your <GAP DESC="foreign">, a by-work, but your only work. This is not my Advice, it is Apo&s;tolical. 1 Tim. 4.13, 15. <HI>Give attendance to Reading, meditate on the&s;e things, give thy &s;elf wholly to them.</HI> It was Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> Motto, <HI>Mini&s;ter Verbi es, hoc age.</HI> Since you are a Mini&s;ter of the word, what|ever you do be&s;ure you mind that work. Your Work and Warfare is Spiritual. You &s;hould not entangle your &s;elves with the affairs of the World, if you would plea&s;e Chri&s;t who has made you his Souldiers. The Work of the Mini&s;try is Work enough for One Man. Let his accompli&s;hment be never &s;o Eminent. That People is guilty of a crying Sin, which does not Maintain

their Teacher (if he has an heart to lay him&s;elf out for the good of their Souls) &s;o Comfortably and Honourably, as that he may have nothing to do, but to attend <HI>the Work of the Lord,</HI> which his Sacred Office does oblige him unto. There was a time when the Hou&s;e of God was for|&s;aken by the Mini&s;ters of it, who <HI>fled every one to his Field,</HI> becau&s;e their Maintenance was Sacrilegiou&s;ly with-held from them. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> at that time the Religious Go|vernour of the Province of Judea, was much offended, not at the Mini&s;ters who were nece&s;&s;itated to leave their Sacred Em|ployment, but at tho&s;e who did not &s;up|port them therein, <HI>Neh.</HI> 13.10, 11. For a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel who&s;e Work is a <HI>Spiritual Husbandry,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. to neglect that, and betake him&s;elf to his Farm, if it is done of choice, is evil. It is no bet|ter when he involves him&s;elf in Merchan|dizing, and in driving of Bargains. <HI>Mer|cator intemplo,</HI> has ever been di&s;allowed. And it is wor&s;e when they entangle them|&s;elves in Law-Suits. For a Man to be <HI>Sacerdos in foro,</HI> is very unbecoming his Profe&s;&s;ion. Let every Man chu&s;e to abide in his Calling. Let Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel &s;pend as little time as may be in fruit|le&s;s and Complemental Vi&s;its: but let them keep clo&s;e to their Studies. Ble&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> once the famous Pa&s;tor of the Church

of <HI>Cambridge: Cambridge</HI> was lifted up to Heaven when that light was &s;hining here, (the Lord grant that he who is to be <HI>Ordained</HI> this day, may be like that Pre|dece&s;&s;or in who&s;e Light all <HI>New-England</HI> rejoyced) He gave me a <HI>Word of Advice,</HI> which I hope I have been the better for it, for more than three&s;core Years. I was then a Young Man, Eighteen Years Old, ingaged in a Voyage for <HI>England,</HI> when I took my leave of him, his Advice to me was, <HI>Keep out of all Company what&s;oever as far as the rules of Chri&s;tianity and Civility will allow, for you will &s;urely find that for the most part, the time &s;pent in your Study will be time mo&s;t profitably &s;pent.</HI> I have found his Advice good and true, and have very much Endeavoured to order my Conver|&s;ation accordingly from my Youth unto this day, I hope not altogether without benefit to &s;ome others as well as to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not inlarge on <HI>Motives,</HI> in which either they that de&s;ign the Mini&s;try, or &s;uch as are already ingaged in it may be concerned. I need not to &s;ay to you, That an Unfaithful Mini&s;ter is the Unhap|pie&s;t Man in the World. A fearful thing it is to Trifle in that Work. <HI>Qui ludit in Cathedra, lugebit in gehenna,</HI> is a true &s;aying and a terrible one. For one that has

&s;hewed others the way to Heaven to fall &s;hort of it him&s;elf, how di&s;mal is the thought of it? Mini&s;ters are called An|gels. If one of them fall &s;hort of Hea|ven, an Angel falls from Heaven. How amazing is it?</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I inlarge on the Con&s;ideration of the Joy and Glory that will follow, if we approve our &s;elves faithful to Chri&s;t and the Souls of Men. When a faithful Mini&s;ter &s;hall &s;ay to Chri&s;t at the la&s;t day, <HI>Lord, here am I and the Children whom thou hast given me,</HI> Here am I, and the Souls who have been Converted and Edi|fied by my Mini&s;try; and one &s;hall &s;tand forth and &s;ay, This is the Man by who&s;e Mini&s;try I was Converted, if it had not been for Thy Pre&s;ence with him, I had never been brought home to Chri&s;t; and another &s;hall &s;ay, This is the Man by who&s;e Mini&s;try I was built up in Faith and Ho|line&s;s, ble&s;&s;ed be Thy Name that ever I &s;aw his Face, ble&s;&s;ed be Thy Name that ever I heard his Voice, Will there not be <HI>glorious Joy</HI>!
