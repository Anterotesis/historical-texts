<HEAD>An EPISTLE To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Turell,</HI> Occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Death</HI> Of his late Virtuous CONSORT. By the Reverend Mr. JOHN ADAMS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHY hangs &s;uch Sorrow on your pen&s;ive Brow?</L>
<L>Say <HI>Turell,</HI> why the Tears &s;o freely flow?</L>
<L>If you lament the lovely Partner fled,</L>
<L>In vain you heave the Sighs, or Rivers &s;hed.</L>
<L>The Darts of Death within her Bo&s;om deep</L>
<L>Have urg'd the fatal Wound, and fix'd the la&s;ting Sleep.</L>
<L>Th' impartial Tyrant round his Arrows throws,</L>
<L>Nor heeds our Pray'rs, nor melts before our Vows.</L>
<L>The Charms of Beauty wither from his Hands,</L>
<L>As fades a Flower, and to a Tempe&s;t bends.</L>
<L>Nor Eloquence can &s;ooth, nor Virtue awe,</L>
<L>Nor Force repell the Pow'r of Nature's Law.</L>
<L>To Limits fix'd, our de&s;tin'd Cour&s;e we bend,</L>
<L>And with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Ha&s;te to Death's pale Empire tend.</L>
<L>From Scene to Scene our &s;hifting Moments go,</L>
<L>And then return the Ground the Du&s;t we owe.</L>
<L>As glides the pictur'd Dream before our Sight,</L>
<L>Wing'd with the fleeting Shadows of the Night,</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="003888_0007_1003057AC4C84610">So born upon the quick &s;ucceeding Hours</L>
<L>We drop in Death, and drink &s;urviving Showers.</L>
<L>Adown our Cheeks th' unwearied Currents &s;hed</L>

<L>Had you the Lyre of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> which could move</L>
<L>The quickned Stones, and each attentive Grove;</L>
<L>Or could you flow in &s;uch a moving Strain</L>
<L>As <HI>Turell</HI> warbled to the li&s;tning Plain;</L>
<L>In vain the tender Plaints would charm her Ears,</L>
<L>Bound to the breathing Con&s;ort of the Spheres.</L>
<L>Who would the doubtful Maze of Life repeat,</L>
<L>Where flattering Scenes the guilded Fancy cheat?</L>
<L>Where Cares and Sorrows circle thro' our Years,</L>
<L>While future Evils ri&s;e before our Fears?</L>
<L>And feel the Fires of heavenly Rapture die,</L>
<L>And blot with Tears the Vi&s;ions of the Sky?</L>
<L>None that had ta&s;ted of &s;ublimer Springs,</L>
<L>Could feel a Thir&s;t for the&s;e inferiour Things.</L>
<L>As who a Lawn, di&s;tinct with &s;ilver Rills,</L>
<L>Would change for burning Sands, or broken Hills?</L>
<L>Or in the Covert of a lonely Cell</L>

<L>And all the Arch of Heaven's expanded Sky</L>
<L>Burnt with unnumber'd Glories to his Eye?</L>
<L>Thro' Death's dark Valley, winding out her Way,</L>
<L>The Saint has opened to a Blaze of Day.</L>
<L>The Shades, now nearer, hang upon your Sight,</L>
<L>But &s;till they border on eternal Light.</L>
<L>So when the gathering Clouds the Skies deform</L>
<L>The Air is dark, and Nature wears the Storm,</L>
<L>While all above is &s;pread a &s;mooth Serene,</L>
<L>And ting'd with Light the gilded Vapours &s;hine.</L>

<P>VERY gracious and exemplary was <HI>this Silence of Aaron,</HI> and very awful was the Providence and <HI>Trial</HI> which made it &s;o excellent and admirable in him. <HI>He</HI> and his <HI>Sons</HI> having been called of <HI>God</HI> unto the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> and &s;olemnly con&s;e|crated to the &s;ervice of the <HI>Sanctuary</HI>; upon the fir&s;t Execution of their Office the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> appeared unto all the People, and a <HI>Fire</HI> came from before the <HI>Lord</HI> and con&s;umed the Burnt-Offering upon the <HI>Altar.</HI> This was a mo&s;t open and glorious Te&s;timony of the <HI>Lord's</HI> accepting of his Sanctuary and Altar, his Prie&s;ts al&s;o and the wor&s;hipping People. Well might it fill them all with tran&s;ports of Joy, and make them <HI>&s;hout</HI> and <HI>fall on their Faces.</HI> So they a|dor'd and gave Thanks to the <HI>King Eternal and Invi&s;ible,</HI> who vouch&s;af'd thus to manife&s;t Him|&s;elf to them, and &s;how 'em His Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003888_0013_100317FE42A24D18">But the Sin and Sudden Death of <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> (the two Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI> who had been dignified among <HI>the Elders of I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>by Name</HI> called up into the <HI>Mount,</HI> to <HI>&s;ee the God of I&s;rael, and He laid not his Hand on them</HI>; Exod. xxiv. 1, 11.) gave a dreadful <HI>Damp</HI> to the Joys of that glorious Day.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>young Prie&s;ts,</HI> proud it may be of their <HI>Office,</HI> and half intoxicated with the Joy of the &s;acred <HI>Fe&s;tival,</HI> took either of them his <HI>Cen&s;er,</HI> probably without the Divine Order to burn In|cen&s;e at that Time; and whereas they &s;hould have taken of the Fire that was newly kindled on the Altar <HI>from before the Lord,</HI> they offer'd <HI>&s;trange Fire,</HI> us'd common Fire, <HI>which He com|manded them not.</HI></P>
<P>This was a great piece of Ra&s;hne&s;s, Irreve|rence and Pre&s;umption in them; and being the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Profanation of <HI>God's</HI> Hou&s;e and Wor&s;hip by the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> it pleas'd the <HI>Holy and Dreadful Maje&s;ty</HI> to &s;trike 'em dead upon the &s;pot. <HI>There went out Fire from the Lord and devoured 'em, and they died before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This was &s;uch a kind of Bereavement as ne|ver but once hapned, enough to &s;wallow up all Words! and no doubt but <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> and all the wor&s;hipping A&s;&s;embly were &s;truck with A&s;toni&s;hment at the terrible Execution. But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in&s;pir'd of God, with a Pre&s;ence of Mind as &s;urpri&s;ing as the pre&s;ent Event, immediately &s;hewed them that &s;o it became the <HI>Holine&s;s of God</HI> to &s;anctify Him&s;elf on them that came nigh Him, if they did not take care to &s;anctify his Name in their Approaches to Him and Mini&s;tra|tions before him: ver. 3. <HI>Then Mo&s;es &s;aid unto
<PB N="3" REF="003888_0014_10031827AE280658">
Aaron, This is it that the Lord &s;pake, &s;aying, I will be &s;anctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be glorified: And Aaron held his Peace.</HI></P>
<P>So <HI>Aaron</HI> hearkned to the Word of God, from the Mouth of his Brother <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and was <HI>dumb</HI> becau&s;e God had done it in his wi&s;e and righ|teous Severity: So he <HI>&s;anctified</HI> the Lord, and glorified Him before all the People, in adoring Silence and profound Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was as indeed became the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> of the Lord. What an <HI>Example</HI> did he give to the frighted gazing Congregation! But he did no more than was his Duty, nor all that neither. It was of God's great Grace and Mercy to him that he bare as he did. Let God have all the Glory, and <HI>Aaron</HI> his prai&s;e al&s;o; for God put Honour on him, glorified his Grace in him.</P>
<P>It is the Duty of all Men, more e&s;pecially of <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> to be Silent under Divine Corrections. <Q>Not only to bear, but to <HI>accept</HI> of the Puni&s;h|ment of Sin. And the mo&s;t effectual Argu|ments, for &s;ilencing and quieting a gracious Heart under Affliction, are tho&s;e that are fetch'd from God's Glory.</Q> The Holy One had &s;anctified his own Name, &amp; vindicated the Glory of it: This &s;ilenc'd <HI>Aaron.</HI> <Q>God was glorified and <HI>Aaron</HI> is &s;atisfied.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrines I would briefly &s;peak to are, 1. That there is a gracious <HI>Silence</HI> which may highly become us in our &s;orrowful <HI>Bereavements</HI>; more e&s;pecially when they are <HI>&s;udden</HI> &amp; awful, and carry much of God's holy Anger and Di&s;|plea&s;ure in them. 2.

<P>The <HI>fir&s;t Death,</HI> the fir&s;t Bereavement of the <HI>fir&s;t Parents</HI> of Mankind, was a very &s;udden and awful Breach upon them!

<P><HI>Job's</HI> Bereavement was the mo&s;t &s;udden and tragical that we ever read of: His <HI>ten Children</HI> fea&s;ting together, and rejoycing in one anothers Love; and on a &s;udden comes a fierce Wind from the Wilderne&s;s, &amp; blows down the Hou&s;e, and buries 'em all together in a moment of Time; cru&s;h'd to pieces in the mighty Ruines of &s;ome princely Fabrick.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI>'s Bereavement in the Sudden Death of <HI>Rachel</HI> was very awful to him; as indeed all Deaths in <HI>Child-birth</HI> are, becau&s;e of the joyful

<P>The fair <HI>Naomi</HI> had a very awful &s;en&s;e of the Divine Anger, when &s;he return'd from the Land of <HI>Moab</HI> de&s;olate and empty; having buried <HI>her two Sons and her Husband</HI>: Ruth i. 20. <HI>Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me, and te&s;tified again&s;t me.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Soul</HI> of the Child was <HI>gone</HI>: gone from the Body which was therefore to turn into Du&s;t, and gone to the World of Spirits, to the Spirits of the Ju&s;t, (as <HI>David</HI> hop'd) to the Bo&s;om of <HI>Abraham</HI>; according to the Prayers he had been pouring out for it, with &s;trong Crying and Tears.</P>
<P>He could not think of a <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> from the State of the Dead, his Prayers and Tears could not bring him back again; he could not expect or de&s;ire it.

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Dead are gone</HI> from this World of ours, no <HI>more to return</HI> to it till the la&s;t Day. The <HI>Spirit</HI> leaves the mortal Body, its earthly Hou&s;e and Tabernacle; and goes to the World of <HI>Spirits,</HI> the invi&s;ible World, into an eternal and unchangeable State.

if our Spirits were not in &s;ome Place or other after this Life is ended; and much le&s;s could we &s;peak properly of <HI>not returning,</HI> if we did not indeed exi&s;t any where.</P>
<P>Yet neither can it be inferred from &s;uch a <HI>mode</HI> of Speech, that the <HI>Body</HI> &s;hall <HI>never</HI> return to Life again, or that the <HI>Soul</HI> &s;hall <HI>never</HI> return into the Body: It only means that the depart|ed <HI>Spirit</HI> returns not hither, that we know of, till the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of the Dead at the la&s;t Day. 'Till that Day the Body will not return from the Grave, nor the Spirit from <HI>Hades,</HI> the invi&s;ible World: But then there will be a <HI>Re-union</HI> of Soul and Body.&mdash; This was an Article of Faith before <HI>Job</HI>'s Time, and has continued to be &s;o down to our Days: Job xix. 25. <HI>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He &s;hall &s;tand at the latter Day upon the Earth; and tho' after my Skin worms de&s;troy this Body, yet in my Fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God: Whom I &s;hall &s;ee for my Self and my Eyes &s;hall behold, and not another: tho' my Reins be con&s;umed within me.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 42. <HI>For this Corruptible &s;hall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal Immortality.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Going</HI> and <HI>not returning</HI> in our <HI>Text</HI> means, never to live again <HI>&s;uch a Life as this</HI> which we now do in the Body, either on bodily or &s;piritual Accounts: <HI>"He &s;hall return no more to his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e,</HI> as it is &s;aid in the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> to his pre&s;ent worldly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or Enjoyments, Bu&s;ine&s;s or Delights: No, nor to the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> here any more, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> bemoaned him&s;elf under the Sentence of Death; <HI>"I &s;hall not &s;ee the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the Living; I &s;hall beheld man no more with the Inhabitants of

And when he pray'd that <HI>Lazarus</HI> might be &s;ent from his bli&s;sful Seat, upon the glorious Errand of converting his Brethren, a Work worthy of the highe&s;t Angel, the <HI>An&s;wer</HI> is, "That there are <HI>living Mini&s;ters</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel, and <HI>Saints departed</HI> have other Work.</P>
<P>The Sum of all is, Our pre&s;ent Life is the <HI>only</HI> Time and State of <HI>Probation</HI> to us; at Death we pa&s;s into the World of Reward or Puni&s;h|ment, which is eternal &amp; unchangeable.

<P>This World is not our <HI>Home.</HI> We are all leaving it. <HI>Time</HI> is of infinite price to mortal Man, and the &s;horter his Time is, it is of &s;o much the more Price. Every <HI>Moment</HI> of it &s;hould be carefully <HI>redeemed,</HI> in ob&s;erving the <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> We &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly remember and con&s;i|der the&s;e things <HI>in the Days of our Bereavement,</HI> in our <HI>Mourning over our Dead.</HI> Then it was that <HI>David</HI> &s;aid, "I &s;hall go to my Dead, it &s;hall not return to me."</P>
<P>This is a moving Sea&s;on, wherein to <HI>mu&s;e</HI> and let <HI>the Fire kindle,</HI> and then <HI>&s;peak</HI> to our Selves and others of our own and their <HI>Dying.</HI> Yea, and to &s;peak to God and &s;ay, as in the xxxix P&s;alm, <HI>Lord! make me to know my End and the Mea&s;ure of my Days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am!

<P><HI>David</HI> the King, the Prophet and the Saint is a good <HI>Teacher,</HI> a great <HI>Example</HI> to us. Let us learn of Him to turn our <HI>Eyes off</HI> from our Dead, <HI>upon</HI> our Selves; upon our own <HI>Souls,</HI> their State, and Frame; and to &s;ay, <Q><HI>My Soul,</HI> thou mu&s;t &s;oon go after thy Dead! in what Preparation art thou for a better World? in what Readine&s;s to leave this? and where would be thy Lot if this Night thou were re|quired hence?</Q></P>
<P>O that we were wi&s;e, that we under&s;tood this, that we were con&s;idering our latter End! This is God's <HI>Wi&s;h</HI> concerning us, and we cannot wi&s;h

our Selves better than this wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing Heart. Let us ask of God this Wi&s;dom which we &s;o greatly want, and which He is li|beral to give.

So many of our few Days already pa&s;t; but &s;o many more at the utmo&s;t Bounds to come; and whether indeed one more of them remain|ing to us, altogether uncertain.</P>
<P>One would think that <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood</HI> &s;hould teach men all this: And if not the Tokens of Death within our Selves, yet the pale and ga&s;tly Face of it on our neare&s;t Relations, Friends and Nei'bours. But neither Fle&s;h and Sen&s;e, nor natural Affection &amp; Sorrow of Heart can make us to know our own End, and the Mea&s;ure of our Days, how frail we are. God only can reach the Hearts of Sinners with an effectual &s;aving Impre&s;&s;ion. Men <HI>&s;ee</HI> others go, and <HI>feel</HI> them|&s;elves going, and yet will not con&s;ider it. There is an Enmity and Aver&s;ion in mortal Man to the &s;ober Con&s;ideration of Death, the realizing his own Death, &amp; the Con&s;equents thereon. Death pa&s;&s;es by us, and touches us, and we are a little mov'd for the pre&s;ent, but pre&s;ently forget it again. Sin which has brought Death on us, has taken away the Under&s;tanding, the Power and Heart to make a ju&s;t and deliberate Reflection on the matter.</P>
<P>This <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> cometh down from <HI>the Father of Light,</HI> and is one of his mo&s;t perfect <HI>Gifts.</HI> We are naturally all Darkne&s;s &amp; In&s;en&s;ibility in our Way to the Grave, as well as when we are in it. We need Divine Teaching in this mo&s;t plain

<P>This is proper <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> of a Soul to it <HI>&s;elf,</HI> and to God, in this mortal Body, and through this pa&s;&s;ing World.

hereby. He &s;ends <HI>Death</HI> into our Windows, Chambers and Bo&s;oms on this Errand; and he is <HI>the Mini&s;ter of God</HI> to us for Good, a Me&s;&s;en|ger one of a thou&s;and. <HI>David</HI> in our Text found <HI>Nathan</HI> &amp; Death alike to him in the Hand of God. It was good for him that his <HI>Child</HI> died. (And in all Probability it had been ill for all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had it lived.) Death rung a Peal in his Ears, and he an&s;wered, <HI>"Lord I am coming!</HI> And as often as any die in our Families, this is the Lord's <HI>Voice</HI> to us, <Q>Man, Woman, Child, thou al&s;o art following! in what Readine&s;s art thou?</Q> Who is the <HI>Man of Wi&s;dom</HI> that hears and an|&s;wers to this Voice of God? This makes it good to go unto the Hou&s;e of Mourning, there to con&s;ider of the End of all Men, and lay the matter to Heart.</P>
<P>This is the Will of God <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> con|cerning us, for <HI>He</HI> has given us the Example. He kept his own Hour in Mind, and quickned Him&s;elf, <HI>"I mu&s;t work the Work of Him that &s;ent Me, while it is Day, the Night cometh.</HI> He retired upon the Death of his Friend the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> and he wept and groan'd in Spirit at the Grave of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; for He was pre&s;ently to die Him|&s;elf, and how was He &s;traitned till it was ac|compli&s;hed?</P>
<P>How great then is the Irreligion of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and the Madne&s;s of mortal Men, in their Incon|&s;ideration of their own frail and dying State! Eccl. ix. 10. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time; but as the Fi&s;hes are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds are caught in the Snare, &s;o are the Sons of Men &s;nared in an evil Time, when it cometh &s;ud|denly upon them.</HI> As if we were not made wi&s;er
<PB N="37" REF="003888_0048_1003184435F7CFA8">
than the <HI>Birds,</HI> or were made as &s;tupid and in|&s;en&s;ible as the very <HI>Fi&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>This Imprudence and Improvidence of the Children of Men is very provoking to God, and great <HI>Sin</HI> in them; being in Contempt of the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has given them, of the <HI>Souls</HI> that He has made them, and of his <HI>Word</HI> which He has written for them, and of all that is there|in &s;aid to 'em of a future State and of the <HI>E|ternal Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> therefore interprets this &s;en&s;e|le&s;s fearle&s;s Life to mean nothing le&s;s than tho&s;e Words of profane Licence, which are &s;o &s;everely animadverted on &amp; expo&s;ed in Scripture, <HI>"Let us eat and drink for to Morrow we die! And to Morrow &s;hall be as this Day and much more abun|dant! Soul, thou ha&s;t Goods laid up for many Years, Eat Drink and be Merry.</HI> What is this but <HI>the God of this World</HI> blinding, &s;tupifying and hard|ning Men to their own De&s;truction! They blow out the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> within them, and quench the <HI>Spirit of the Lord</HI> in his Convictions. Let him &s;mite and wound us we do but half a|wake, and pre&s;ently fall a&s;leep again. Let Him lead us again and again to the Grave after our Friends, we go home and forget where we have been, what manner of Men, what corruptible Fle&s;h we are, and that we our &s;elves may be next carried out and buried.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Relatives</HI> in their Sorrows over their Dead judge them&s;elves by what has been &s;aid, and be thereby directed and quickned. Let us at lea&s;t make <HI>this Improvement</HI> of the Di&s;pen&s;ation, <Q>I &s;hall go after! in what readine&s;s am I? Where and how do I look to meet tho&s;e who

<P>But as my <HI>Text</HI> came from the Lips of a <HI>pious Parent</HI> in his Mourning, &s;o I am led in a peculiar Manner to direct the pre&s;ent Truth to <HI>Them</HI>: Yet not to them only, but to <HI>Children</HI> al&s;o in the Death of Parents, and &s;o in every <HI>other</HI> Relation. I go on therefore to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV. Parents</HI> e&s;pecially &s;hould think of this in their <HI>Bereavements,</HI> and in their Sorrows over their <HI>dead Children.</HI> The Words of <HI>David</HI> be|long fir&s;t to Them, <HI>"I &s;hall go to it.</HI></P>
<P>The Death of <HI>Children</HI> is the mo&s;t common Ca&s;e in the whole Cour&s;e of <HI>Death.</HI> Parents often live to bury many Children, and &s;ome|times all. They that live long in this World, as the Excellent <HI>Judge Hale</HI> &s;aid on the Death of a Son, mu&s;t look for this Grief. And the Grief is u&s;ually great in this Ca&s;e, for Natural Affection is like Water, flowing downward. The Love of Parents runs down in a Torrent, the Love of Children returns as in an Eddy, which is al&s;o caus'd by the Stream. When the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> would repre&s;ent the mo&s;t bitter Grief, He repre&s;ents it by a <HI>Mourning for an Only Son, and for a fir&s;t-born.</HI> Zech. xii. 10.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Mourning was of Parents for their Son. <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death was a bitter Grief to our fir&s;t Parents. It called for Tears of Blood, and was as a Sword in the Bowels of <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>When God would prove <HI>Abraham</HI> it was in this mo&s;t tender point. <HI>"Take now thy Son, thy only one, whom thou love&s;t, and offer him to me.</HI> The God of <HI>Abraham</HI> knew what of all earthly

Gene&s;is xlii. 36, 37, 38. <HI>And Jacob their Father &s;aid to them, Me have ye bereaved of my Children; Jo&s;eph is not, and Simeon is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, and ye will take Benjamin away: All the&s;e things are again&s;t me. And Reuben &s;pake unto his Father &s;aying, &s;tay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my Hand, and I will bring him to thee again. And he &s;aid, My Son &s;hall not go down with you, for his Brother is dead, and he is left alone; if Mi&s;chief befal him by the Way in which ye go, then &s;hall ye bring down my gray Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI> Chap. xliii. 6, 11, 13. <HI>And I&s;rael &s;aid, Wherefore dealt ye &s;o ill with me, as to tell the Man whether ye had yet a Brother</HI>?&mdash; But <HI>if it mu&s;t be &s;o now,&mdash; Take your Brother and ari&s;e, go again to the Man; and God Almighty give you Mercy before him, that he may &s;end away your other Brother and Benjamin!

to the tender Parent, undoubted and certain to him, and mourn'd accordingly.</P>
<P>In like manner the mighty Reverence and Strength of <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Grace was tried, as with <HI>Fire,</HI> in the Sight of all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>he held his Peace.</HI> His profound <HI>Silence</HI> &s;pake aloud his profound <HI>Grief.&mdash; Job</HI> had been long before tri|ed in more awful manner than this of <HI>Aaron</HI>; and he &s;tands a prior In&s;tance of <HI>Parental</HI> Ten|derne&s;s &amp; Con&s;tancy.

<P>My <HI>Text</HI> relates how <HI>David</HI> behav'd on the Death of his <HI>Child,</HI> but on <HI>more bitter</HI> Occa&s;ions of Grief he <HI>lo&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, when he &s;hould rather have kept the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul, and call'd in the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on and Grace: I mean more e&s;pecially on the Death of <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI>; unto Whom he could not wi&s;h to have his Soul ga|thered; tho' he wi&s;hed to have died for him, if he might have lived to repent.</P>
<P>The Love of <HI>Mothers</HI> is yet more tender. We read of <HI>two</HI> under a like Bereavement, but not in a like Pa&s;&s;ion of Grief; the Widow of <HI>Zidon</HI> and the <HI>Shunamite</HI>: When the one &s;aw her <HI>Son</HI>

<P>The <HI>Parent</HI> we &s;hould think will improve the Grief, behave and &s;peak aright under it; &s;peak unto <HI>God,</HI> to him&s;elf and his. He has Years, Experience and Wi&s;dom; is a <HI>Father</HI> and has &s;een much of a dying World: And what is the Father's <HI>Le&s;&s;on</HI> from his Child's Death, but <HI>this</HI> in my Text? This at lea&s;t, this the lea&s;t, <HI>"I &s;hall go to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, Let <HI>Parents prepare to part</HI> with their Children. Look on them as <HI>dying</HI> Crea|tures, and accordingly care for their <HI>Souls.</HI> Look not upon them as <HI>yours,</HI> but God's, who may call for them when he will, having only given them to you in Tru&s;t and Charge, to educate them for him, for his Service here, and for Ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s in Him&s;elf for ever. Teach 'em betimes to know God and them&s;elves; that they have precious immortal Souls, and that God is the Fa|ther, Lord and Judge of their Spirits; that they are made for another and far better Life, may very &s;oon die, and mu&s;t whenever God orders, who will &s;urely bring them into Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let <HI>Children</HI> think of and prepare for their going hence <HI>before their Parents.</HI> They are by no means &s;ure of out-living them, much le&s;s &s;hould they expect it. Did not <HI>Job</HI>'s Sons and Daughters all die before hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? I mean his fir&s;t <HI>Quiver full</HI> of them. So did <HI>Aaron</HI>'s two Sons

die in the Pre&s;ence of their Father; And <HI>Nao|mi</HI> buried her two Sons in the Land of <HI>Moab.</HI> Indeed Parents naturally <HI>de&s;ire</HI> that their Chil|dren may out-live them; and good Parents may let their Children hear 'em <HI>ask</HI> it of God in their daily Family Prayers; that theirs (by his holy Will) may live to &s;erve Him when they are gone. With Reverence &amp; great Submi&s;&s;ion Children may &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> to &s;uch Prayers of their Parents; but they may not plea&s;e them&s;elves with the Expectation of &s;urviving their loving and dear Parents; to come into their E&s;tate, nor for any wor&s;e Ends. We read of One who wickedly expected to out-live his Father and &s;aid, <HI>The Days of Mourning for my Father are at Hand, and then I will kill my Brother.</HI> But pious Children, from the Day of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death, think of dying before their Parents.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let <HI>bereaved Parents be greatly quickned in their Preparations for their own Death.</HI> It is a &s;orrowful Ca&s;e <HI>to need this Way</HI> of learning, by <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Providence. We &s;hould prepare for Death before we come to be Parents. Yet we need to learn it more and more, better and better, as long as we live. <HI>Live and Learn,</HI> learn to die as long as you live, and by all the Sorrows and Changes of Life e&s;pecially. Learn betimes, learn in <HI>due Sea&s;on,</HI> and yet learn in <HI>Age, out of due Time,</HI> if you have not learn'd before. Learn <HI>this</HI> Le&s;&s;on over and over again, get it well by Heart, rivet it in your Memory, &s;peak of it to your late&s;t Breath, and practice it in your dying Moments.</P>

And la&s;tly, <HI>Pious Parents</HI> &s;hould even find a <HI>&s;acred Plea&s;ure</HI> in thinking of <HI>going after and unto their pious Children decea&s;ed.</HI> They may fol|low them to the Grave with the con&s;olatory and peaceful Thought, which our <HI>Venerable Eliot</HI> &s;pake out aloud as he went, after his dead <HI>Son, This is the Way to Heaven!</HI> As Grace &amp; Friend|&s;hip wro't in the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> and he &s;uddenly an&s;wered on his hearing of the Death of <HI>Lazarus, "Let us go and die with him!</HI> So a like Tran&s;port of Love and De&s;ire, may be forgiven to a <HI>gracious Parent</HI> on the Death of a Child, in whom he has &s;een the ruling Grace of God from early Infancy. <HI>Jacob</HI> did not behave like Him|&s;elf, when he refu&s;ed to be comforted on the &s;uppo&s;ed Death of &s;uch a Son as <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>"No, but I will go down to the Grave after my Son mournin!</HI> It becomes <HI>the Seed of Jacob</HI> rather in the Days of Mourning over their pious Decea&s;ed, to take to them&s;elves that other and better Tran&s;port of the Aged <HI>Patriarch,</HI> when he heard of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> yet alive, and next to the Throne in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and to &s;ay, <Q>The Soul of my Dead lives in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> far above all Heavens, let me die and go to be with him there for evermore.</Q></P>
<P>It was in this Hope that <HI>Jacob</HI> gave Com|mandment concerning his <HI>Bones,</HI> that his Sons

&s;hould bury Him with his <HI>Fathers</HI>; and in the like Hope a believing <HI>Parent</HI> might de&s;ire to be laid with his <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Surely it ca&s;t &s;ome Light into the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Grave that was ever dug, that <HI>Abel,</HI> the Darling of <HI>Heaven</HI> as well as of <HI>Adam,</HI> was the Per&s;on bu|ried; and it may &s;eem to the <HI>Godly</HI> thro' all Ages a kind of &s;anctifying and &s;weetning the Grave for ever. It is only and wholly the <HI>Grace of Chri&s;t</HI> in a Child before its Death, that can make it an <HI>Object of De&s;ire</HI> after Death, in a religious Parent's Heart.</P>
<P>I hope I have in all your Hearts <HI>this Ground for Communion &s;till with my dear decea&s;ed Child,</HI> in whom I think I &s;aw the &s;hining Grace of God before &s;he came among you, and more &s;ince; tho' always under the Veil of great Mode&s;ty and Re&s;erve. In the &s;everal Relations of a Child, a Wife, a Mother, a Si&s;ter, a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and a Friend, &s;he has found Grace to carry her &s;elf in a laudable and exemplary manner. You are Witne&s;&s;es that &s;he has liv'd <HI>blamele&s;s and without Offence</HI> among you, and we who have known more of her &s;ecret Walk with God, and Watch over her &s;elf in her Retirements, have <HI>this for our Rejoicing, That in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom but by the Grace of God, &s;he has had her Conver&s;ation in the World.</HI></P>
<P>You will give me leave therefore openly to utter my great Thankfulne&s;s to God, that He has pleas'd to Honour me before You in being the Father of &s;uch a Child; and if I have any <HI>Hope</HI> of the Grace of God in my own Soul, I

<P>[The Sovereign <HI>God of our Spirits</HI> made her a plea&s;ant <HI>Soul</HI> to her Parents from her <HI>Infancy. Thrice</HI> &s;he received the Sentence of Death before &s;he was <HI>Eighteen Months</HI> old, and it was a me|lancholly Time with us by rea&s;on of her great Weakne&s;s, and the mortal Symptoms returning on her. It kept us the more in con&s;tant &amp; fer|vent <HI>Supplications</HI> for her Life, and in daily <HI>Re|&s;ignations</HI> of it; and her &s;econd and third Re|coveries were as &s;urpri&s;ing to her <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> and unto others who &s;aw her in her low E&s;tate, as unto her near Relations.

her great Weakne&s;s excepted: She half opened one of her &s;unk Eyes, and an&s;wered unto the <HI>Barrow</HI> in the Street, repeating what was cry'd there to be Sold. When the dear and Reverend Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> &s;aw this &s;trange Recovery, and had expre&s;s'd a kind of A&s;toni&s;hment at it, he turn'd to me and &s;aid, <Q>Well Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> I am per&s;waded God purpo&s;es to make this <HI>Child</HI> a Ble&s;&s;ing and remarkable in her Life.</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this <HI>Bodily Weakne&s;s</HI> her <HI>Soul</HI> made uncommon Improvements for an Infant State; and it may be much <HI>the more</HI> for the weak State of the Body; for &s;he had not Strength to run about and play like other Chil|dren, which was then our Grief. We made it therefore our daily Plea&s;ure, and her Diver&s;ion, to learn her <HI>Letters,</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> to God her Maker, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and to fill her little Mind with the Stories of all the <HI>Holy Men</HI> on Sacred Record; to &s;trike her Admira|tion and Affection with true <HI>Excellency</HI> and Per|fection; for which End I took care to &s;peak to her of every thing in a ju&s;t and <HI>proper</HI> Manner, if po&s;&s;ible to convey <HI>regular</HI> Ideas into her, as of the Greatne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of God, &s;o of all that relates to his <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and Service. By this Means before &s;he could go alone &s;he had &s;uck'd in a <HI>little Trea&s;ure</HI> of Sacred Knowlege, and was nouri&s;hed up from the Brea&s;t with the <HI>&s;incere Milk of the Word</HI>; the Knowlege whereof became the humble <HI>Pride</HI> of her Childhood, for we taught her to <HI>value</HI> her &s;elf on it, as far better than bodily Ornaments.]</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="003888_0062_1003185AF332E348">I early ob&s;erv'd her daily Retirements <HI>to pray to her Father in Heaven,</HI> at five or &s;ix year old, or before; and tho't it my Duty to <HI>prai&s;e</HI> her for it, and examine her <HI>how</HI> and for <HI>what</HI> &s;he prayed? and whether &s;he kept to Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s excellent <HI>Form</HI> for Children? but her <HI>An&s;wer</HI> greatly pleas'd as well as &s;urpris'd me, "that &s;he found God gave her Words to &s;peak when &s;he began to pray.

<P>The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> was moving upon her often in her following Youth.

<P>Her Heart was always <HI>above the Things of this World</HI>; &s;o far as I could perceive from fir&s;t to la&s;t; and neither the <HI>Pro&s;pects</HI> of it elevated her, nor <HI>Injuries</HI> from it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oil'd or depre&s;s'd her.

<P>She early gave her Self up to God, but her <HI>timorous</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition re&s;train'd her from proceed|ing early to the <HI>Lord's Table</HI>; nor was it with|out much Conflict of Soul and great Di&s;tre&s;s, thro' Fear of coming unworthily, that &s;he at la&s;t came into full Communion.

<P>[Her dear <HI>Cou&s;ins</HI> tell me that when they &s;ometimes <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> her, and made &s;ome abode with her, &s;he would in the <HI>Afternoons</HI> &s;lip away from them, and at an hours End return with a Smile and tell 'em how pleas'd &s;he had been to hear 'em &s;o merry.

<P>But after all it mu&s;t be &s;aid, That her Temper was exceeding <HI>timorous,</HI> and her Di&s;temper <HI>Hy&s;teric,</HI> the Accidents of which all know to be a <HI>Swimming</HI> of the Head and <HI>Inquietude</HI> of Mind.

<P>This &s;hort Account of <HI>Her,</HI> living and dying, is both <HI>con&s;olatory</HI> to us, and al&s;o <HI>monitory</HI> and exciting, (and to <HI>Young People</HI> in particular) to be in&s;tant and earne&s;t in caring for our Souls, and getting ready for a dying Hour.&mdash; What a <HI>Joy</HI> &s;hould it be to <HI>me</HI> this day, to be able to <HI>move you</HI> from the <HI>Example</HI> of one of <HI>my Chil|dren?</HI> O might the pious <HI>Parents</HI> of this Flock, all of them, have the like and greater Con&s;ola|tion in the Burial of their Adult Children, if God call 'em to &s;uch a Sorrow!

I have heard that Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> with other Wi&s;e and Polite <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> have plac'd her on a Table and &s;etting round it own'd them&s;elves diverted with her Stories. &mdash; Before &s;he was <HI>four</HI> Years old (&s;o &s;trong and tenacious was her Me|mory) &s;he could &s;ay the greater Part of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m,</HI> many of the <HI>P&s;alms,</HI> &s;ome hundred Lines of the be&s;t <HI>Poetry,</HI> read di&s;tinctly, and make pertinent Remarks on many things &s;he read.&mdash;</P>
<P>She grew in <HI>Knowlege</HI> (the mo&s;t u&s;eful) day by day, and had the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> before her Eyes.</P>
<P>She <HI>pray'd</HI> to <HI>God</HI> &s;ometimes by excellent <HI>Forms</HI> (recommended to her by her Father and &s;uited to her Age &amp; Circum&s;tances) and at other times <HI>ex corde,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> helping her Infirmities. When her Father upon a Time enquir'd of her what Words &s;he u&s;ed in Prayer to God, &s;he an&s;|wer'd him,&mdash; <HI>"That when &s;he was upon her Knees God gave her Expre&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Even at the Age of <HI>four, five,</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;ix</HI> &s;he ask'd many a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> about divine My&s;te|ries, and carefully laid up and hid the <HI>An&s;wers</HI> &s;he received to them, in her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003888_0072_10030633896B6C38">Throughout her Childhood &s;he di&s;cover'd a very <HI>&s;erious</HI> Spirit. Her Heart was tender, and her Con&s;cience a well-inform'd faithful Guide, and Monitor.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t that I am able to collect of her Life from <HI>&s;ix</HI> to <HI>ten</HI> is general (and from her) viz. That her <HI>Father</HI> daily in&s;tructed her, and inrich'd her Mind with the be&s;t Knowlege; and excited her to the due Performance of all Duty. And that her tender gracious <HI>Mother</HI> (who dy'd about four years before her) often pray'd for, and over her, and gave her the wi&s;e&s;t Coun&s;els, and mo&s;t faithful Warnings; and that &s;he was thank|ful and grew in Knowlege and (&s;he hoped) in Grace under them.&mdash; That &s;he lov'd the <HI>School</HI> and the Exerci&s;es of it, and made a laudable Progre&s;s in the various Kinds of Learning proper to her Age and Sex.</P>
<P>At <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> (if not before) &s;he was able to write; for in the Year 1718, I find a Letter of her honour'd Father's to her wrote in An&s;wer to one of her's, Dated <HI>Brookline</HI>&mdash;Which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf well plea&s;ed with. A Copy of it follows.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In this her Eleventh Year I find an <HI>Hymn</HI> fairly written by her, dated <HI>January</HI> 4. 1718. Which I give you Verbatim.</P>
<Q><L>I Fear the Great <HI>Eternal One</HI> above,</L>
<L>The God of Grace the God of Love:</L>
<L>He to whom <HI>Seraphims</HI> Hallelujah's &s;ing,</L>
<L>And Angels do their Songs and Prai&s;es bring.</L>
<L>Happy the Soul that does in Heaven re&s;t,</L>
<L>Where with his Saviour he is ever ble&s;t;</L>
<L>With heavenly Joys and Rapture is po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>

<L>Happy are they that walk in Wi&s;dom Ways,</L>
<L>That tread her Paths, and &s;hine in all her Rays.</L></Q>
<P>Her <HI>Father</HI> was pleas'd to encourage her in this feeble <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> &s;he made at Ver&s;e: He con|de&s;cended to return her <HI>Rhymes</HI> like her own,

level to her pre&s;ent Capacity, with a &s;pecial Aim to keep and fix her Mind on God and <HI>heavenly Things,</HI> with which &s;he had begun. He therefore wrote and gave her the following Lines, which he permits me to in&s;ert.</P>
<Q><L><HI>JOY of my Life!</HI> is this thy lovely Voice?</L>
<L>Sing on, and a fond <HI>Father's</HI> Heart rejoyce.</L>
<L>'Twas nobly dar'd, my charming Child! a Song</L>

<L>Be Sacred to thy God and to his Prai&s;e:</L>
<L>Thy Infant Wit devote to things Divine,</L>

<L>But do&s;t thou truly fear the <HI>Eternal One</HI>?</L>
<L>Be &s;ure you do, for he is God alone.</L>
<L>And would you join with <HI>Angels</HI> in their Songs?</L>
<L>Thy earlie&s;t and thy be&s;t to Him belongs.</L>
<L>And do&s;t thou count them <HI>ble&s;t</HI> that re&s;t above,</L>
<L>In <HI>Je&s;us</HI> Pre&s;ence, Image and his Love?</L>
<L>Now &s;eek a Name among his Saints, and let</L>
<L>Thy Heart on heavenly Things be early &s;et.</L>
<L>Then happy thou, <HI>my Child,</HI> in Wi&s;dom's Ways</L>
<L>Shining in thy <HI>transfigur'd Saviour</HI>'s Rays.</L></Q>
<P>The&s;e Conde&s;centions of her <HI>Father</HI> were no doubt of great U&s;e to her, and had in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Effect propos'd, to put her on think|ing and writing more and better, and to gain more of his E&s;teem for Ingenuity and Piety, which &s;he was wi&s;ely ambitious of; but above all to approve her Heart before God, <HI>her Hea|venly Father who &s;ees in &s;ecret.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur's of the fifth In&s;tant was exceeding plea&s;ant to me, both your Paraphra&s;e on the 137 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Letter</HI> that inclos'd it. In the Letter you wi&s;h you might inherit &s;omething of your Father's Soul and therein his Gifts. If that be worthy of your De&s;ire God has in a great Mea&s;ure given it to you; only you mu&s;t go on by Reading and Study to improve the Powers which God has given you. My poor Gift is in thinking and writing with a little Eloquence, and a poetical turn of Thought. This, in proportion to the Advan|tages you have had, under the nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful Re&s;traints of your Sex, you enjoy to the full of what I have done before you. With the Advantages of my liberal Education at School &amp; College, I have no rea&s;on to think but that your Genius in Writing would have excell'd mine. But there is no great Progre&s;s or Improvement ever made in any thing but by U&s;e and Indu&s;try and Time. If you dili|gently improve your &s;tated and &s;ome vacant Hours every Day or Week to read your <HI>Bible,</HI> and other u&s;eful Books, you will in&s;en&s;ibly

grow in Knowlege and Wi&s;dom, fine Tho'ts and good Judgment, from Year to Year, to the Plea&s;ure of your Friends, the Profit of your Children, if God give you any, and to your own &s;piritual and everla&s;ting Advantage; if you direct all unto, and govern it by the Glory of God. But as to a Poetical Flight now and then, let it be with you only a thing by the by. At your lei&s;ure and &s;pare Hours you may indulge your Inclinations this way. But let them not break in either upon the daily Hours of &s;ecret Reading or Devotion. &mdash; So you &s;hall con&s;ecrate your Heart &amp; Life, your Mu&s;e and your daily Works, to the Honour of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Way of your own Salvation.</P>
<P>You ask me to forgive the flow of your Affections, which run with &s;o &s;wift a Current of filial Duty as may carry you beyond your &s;elf &s;ometimes, and make you wanting in that Re&s;pect which you aim at expre&s;&s;ing". It is true, my <HI>Dear,</HI> that a young fond and mu&s;ical Genius is ea&s;ily carry'd away thus; and never more than when it runs into the Prai&s;es of what it loves; and I would have you there|fore careful again&s;t this Error, even when you &s;ay your Tho'ts of Reverence and E&s;teem to your <HI>Father,</HI> or to a <HI>Spou&s;e</HI> if ever you &s;hould live to have one. It is ea&s;y to be lavi&s;h and run into fooli&s;h Flatteries. I think you have done well to correct your Self for &s;ome of your Excur&s;ions of this kind toward me. Your <HI>Fa|ther</HI> is pleas'd with your love; and <HI>you</HI> are but a poor partial Judge of his Gifts or Vir|tues.&mdash;But if you &s;ee any thing of Chri&s;t in any, and whatever things are <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> whatever

things are <HI>lovely,</HI> think of the&s;e things and i|mitate them.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire me to correct the faults in your Ver&s;es. I have always done that freely, both as to your Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e. Nor be di&s;cou|rag'd hereby, but in&s;tructed. It is your learn|ing time, and I am not a&s;ham'd of my <HI>Pupil.</HI>&mdash; But you have taken the la&s;t Paper of Ver&s;es with you, which prevents my &s;ending you any Emendations of them.

<L>YOU beauteous <HI>Dames,</HI> if that my <HI>Love</HI> you &s;ee,</L>
<L>With eager Steps conduct him here to me,</L>
<L>Tell him no Joy to me you can impart,</L>
<L>And that no Pain is like a bleeding Heart.</L>
<L>Say I am <HI>&s;ick of Love,</HI> and moaning ly,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the &s;ad <HI>Eccho</HI> to my Groans reply,</L>
<L><HI>Who is thy Love</HI>? the &s;cornful <HI>Maids</HI> reply,</L>
<L>And for what <HI>Form</HI> wa&s;te you your Bloom in &s;ighs?</L>
<L>Let's know the <HI>Man,</HI> if he be worth your Care,</L>
<L>Or does de&s;erve the tender Love you bear.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t your Reque&s;t with Plea&s;ure I obey,</L>
<L>Your &s;trict Attention give to what I &s;ay.</L>
<L>My <HI>Love</HI> excells all that's on Earth call'd Fair,</L>
<L>As the bright <HI>Sun</HI> excells the meane&s;t Star.</L>
<L>His Head is Wi&s;doms &s;pacious Theatre,</L>
<L>Riches of Grace and Beauty there appear.</L>
<L>A down his Shoulders with becoming Pride</L>
<L>Falls his fine Hair in beauteous Ringletts ty'd.</L>
<L>His &s;parkling Eyes in &s;plendent Lu&s;tre vie,</L>
<L>With the Twin Stars that grace the azure Sky.</L>
<L>His Cheeks excel the fragrant blu&s;hing Ro&s;e</L>
<L>Which in the fruitful Vale of <HI>Sharon</HI> grows.</L>
<L>His Lips like <HI>Lillies</HI> in their flowry Bloom</L>
<L>Yield a &s;weet Odour and a rich Perfume.</L>
<L>His Ivory Arms more charming to behold</L>
<L>Than orient Pearls, incas'd in &s;hining Gold.</L>
<L>His well turn'd Legs like &s;tately Pillars &s;tand</L>
<L>Of Marble, poli&s;h'd by a curious Hand.</L>
<L>His Mien is noble and augu&s;t his Air,</L>
<L>His Countenance as <HI>Lebanon</HI> does appear.</L>

<P>The&s;e were the early <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> of her Youth at <HI>Poetry,</HI> in which it mu&s;t be freely own'd that as there are many things <HI>good</HI> and <HI>ingenious,</HI> &s;o there is a great deal low and juvenile; which the candid under&s;tanding Reader will be ready to excu&s;e from that common Rule of <HI>a Child's &s;peaking and writing as a Child.</HI> At the &s;ame time, the Turn of the Mind here evident to God and Religion, is what the Pious will e&s;teem and prai&s;e, and it is to be wi&s;h'd that Children may be taken herewith and drawn to imitate.&mdash; It is eno' (as her honour'd Father elegantly expre&s;s'd it to me) if they may be accepted as a <HI>green offer|ing of Fir&s;t-fruits bro't to the Door of the Sanctua|ry,</HI> the promi&s;ing <HI>Earne&s;t</HI> of a future Harve&s;t: at lea&s;t, as the fir&s;t li&s;ping of the Tongue at Words is a plea&s;ing <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> to the Ear of the <HI>Mother,</HI> and the fir&s;t Efforts of the <HI>Mind</HI> at Rea&s;oning de|lightful to a <HI>Father,</HI> &s;o are the fir&s;t Ri&s;ings of a natural <HI>Genius</HI> unto a wi&s;e Ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>(2.) In <HI>Pro&s;e</HI> there are al&s;o many Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some E&s;&s;ay to write her own <HI>Life,</HI> which begins with Thank&s;givings to God for di&s;tingui&s;h|ing her from mo&s;t in the World by the Ble&s;&s;ings
<PB N="76" REF="003888_0086_10031883AD4BF668">
of <HI>Nature, Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> which &s;he &s;pe|cifies and enumerates in the following manner,</P>
<P N="1">(1) I thank God for my Immortal <HI>Soul,</HI> and that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> &amp; Under&s;tanding which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes me from the lower Creation.</P>
<P N="2">(2) For my Birth in a <HI>Chri&s;tian Country,</HI> in a Land of Light, where the true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t are known.</P>
<P N="3">(3) For pious and honourable <HI>Parents,</HI> where|by I am favour'd beyond many others.</P>
<P N="4">(4) For faithful and godly <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who are from time to time &s;hewing me the Way of Sal|vation.</P>
<P N="5">(5) For a <HI>Polite</HI> as well as <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Education.</P>
<P N="6">(6) For <HI>re&s;training Grace,</HI> that I have been with-held from more open and gro&s;s Violations of God's holy Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Her Tho'ts on Matrimony, with the Rules whereby &s;he re&s;olved to guide her Self in that im|portant Affair of Life.</HI></P>
<P>She writes of the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God in making Man a <HI>Sociable</HI> Creature; of the In&s;titution of Marriage in the paradi&s;aical State, and the Happine&s;s of the <HI>fir&s;t Couple</HI>; and what alone will render Per&s;ons <HI>happy</HI> in our fallen State; namely, a faithful Di&s;charge of all the <HI>Duties</HI> of that Relation; and then particulari|&s;es the Duties, and treats of the Mi&s;chiefs that follow upon the Neglect of them; Shews at large what their Duty is who are about to enter into that State, namely, to &s;eek to God by hum|ble Prayer for his Direction and Conduct, and that he would over-rule all the Circum&s;tances
<PB N="77" REF="003888_0087_100318854A106A80">
of that momentous Affair in Mercy, on which &s;o much of the Comfort and Plea&s;ure of Life depends.&mdash;She carries her Tho'ts to the Afflicti|ons and Temptations of that Condition, and Prays for &s;ufficient Grace to carry aright un|der all. And for her A&s;&s;i&s;tance in making a right Choice &s;he laid down a Number of <HI>Rules,</HI> from which &s;he re&s;olves never to &s;tart: Some of them are the following,</P>
<P N="1">(1) I would admit the Addre&s;&s;es of no Per&s;on who is not de&s;cended of pious and credible Pa|rents.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Who has not the Character of a &s;trict <HI>Morali&s;t,</HI> &s;ober, temperate, ju&s;t and hone&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Diligent</HI> in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>prudent</HI> in Matters.</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>Fixt in his Religion,</HI> a con&s;tant Attender on the publick Wor&s;hip, and who appears not in God's Hou&s;e with the Gravity becoming a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="5">(5) Of a &s;weet and agreable <HI>Temper</HI>; for if he be Owner of all the former good Qualifica|tions, and fails here, my Life will be &s;till un|comfortable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many Letters to her <HI>honoured Father</HI> on various Occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>Before She had &s;een <HI>Eighteen,</HI> &s;he had read, and (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) dige&s;ted all the Engli&s;h <HI>Poetry,</HI> and polite Pieces in <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> printed and Manu&s;cripts in her Father's well furni&s;h'd Li|brary, and much &s;he borrow'd of her Friends and Acquaintance. She had indeed &s;uch a Thir&s;t after knowlege that the Lei&s;ure of the Day did not &s;uffice, but &s;he &s;pent whole Nights in reading.</P>
<P>I find &s;he was &s;ometimes fir'd with a laudable Ambition of rai&s;ing the honour of her <HI>Sex,</HI> who are therefore under Obligations to her; and all will be ready to own &s;he had a fine <HI>Genius,</HI> and is to be placed among tho&s;e who have excell'd.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="003888_0089_1003065F403B8260">When I was fir&s;t indin'd (by the Motions of God's Providence and Spirit) to &s;eek her Ac|quaintance (which was about the Time &s;he en|tred her <HI>nineteenth</HI> Year) I was &s;urpriz'd and charm'd to find her &s;o accompli&s;h'd. I found her in a good mea&s;ure Mi&s;tre&s;s of the polite&s;t <HI>Writers</HI> and their Works; could point out the Beauties in them, and had made many of their be&s;t Tho'ts her own: And as &s;he went into more free Conver&s;ation, &s;he di&s;cours'd how ad|mirably on many Subjects!</P>
<P>I grew by Degrees into &s;uch an Opinion of her good <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> that when &s;he put me upon tran&s;lating a <HI>P&s;alm</HI> or two, I was ready to ex|cu&s;e my Self, and if I had not fear'd to di&s;plea&s;e her &s;hould have deny'd her Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>After her <HI>Marriage</HI> which was on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 11th. 1726, her Cu&s;tom was once in a Month or two, to make &s;ome <HI>new E&s;&s;ay</HI> in Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e, and to read from Day to Day as much as a faithful Di&s;charge of the Duties of her new Condition gave Lei&s;ure for: and I think I may with Truth &s;ay, that &s;he made the writing of Poetry a <HI>Recreation</HI> and not a <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>What greatly contributed to increa&s;e her Knowlege in <HI>Divinity, Hi&s;tory, Phy&s;ick, Contro|ver&s;y,</HI> as well as <HI>Poetry,</HI> was her attentive hear|ing mo&s;t that I read upon tho&s;e Heads thro' the long Evenings of the Winters as we &s;at together.</P>
<P>Some of the many remarkable things &s;he wrote in her <HI>Marriage State</HI> are the following; &s;ome in <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> and more in <HI>Pro&s;e.</HI></P>

Blackmore</HI>'s Poetical Works.&mdash;She knew it would be plea&s;ing eno' to her <HI>Father,</HI> to hear her &s;ing in Prai&s;e of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> of whom &s;he always heard him &s;peak with great E&s;teem; not as the fir&s;t of <HI>Poets,</HI> but as one of the be&s;t; con|&s;ecrating his Mu&s;e to the cau&s;e of <HI>Virtue</HI> &amp; <HI>Re|ligion,</HI> with a mo&s;t noble Aim to in&s;pire the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of the Nation, with the true Sentiments of Glory and U&s;efulne&s;s; than which nothing could be more worthy of a <HI>Chri&s;tian Poet</HI> and an <HI>Engli&s;h Patriot.</HI> And as &s;uch He is celebrated in the following <HI>Poem.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="87" REF="003888_0097_100318986FC3DFF0">This is the &s;hort and broken Account of my Soul at pre&s;ent.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear and only Si&s;ter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough we are ab&s;ent, I hope we are not forgetful of each other. I am &s;ure my Tho'ts are often employ'd about you, and I am daily concern'd for you. You have now ju&s;t pa&s;t your Childhood, and are arriv'd to that Stage of Life which is mo&s;t expos'd to Snares and Temptations; and according as you behave in it, your Reflections will be unea&s;y or comfortable after|wards. Think not the Coun&s;els of a <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> who loves you as her &s;elf, un&s;ea&s;onable; or the Effect of melan|choly Vapours. No, It is from the be&s;t Love to you, and my great De&s;ire to &s;ee you vertuous and happy.</P>
<P>Let me warn you then of the <HI>Vanity</HI> and Deceit there is in all Worldly Things, and urge you to imploy your <HI>Time</HI> in working out your Soul's Salvation; and therefore in learning tho&s;e things that will help you Heavenward; and not &s;pend it in tho&s;e Plea&s;ures that will not profit, or in tho&s;e Follies and Sins which will in the End <HI>bite like a Serpent and &s;ting like an Adder.</HI> &mdash; You have a pre|cious Opportunity for In&s;truction and Improvement under the be&s;t of earthly Fathers. O then improve it to the be&s;t Purpo&s;es, le&s;t you provoke God to deprive you of your Advantages, and take away your <HI>Father</HI> from your Head &mdash;O remember your Creator now, even <HI>now</HI> in the Days of your Youth: Let him have your fir&s;t Love and Service: Keep in Mind what Chri&s;t the Wi&s;dom of <HI>God</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> Fly to that great <HI>Shepard</HI> who takes the Lambs in his Bo&s;om. He greatly delights in the Virtue and Piety of Young Per&s;ons.&mdash;When the <HI>Young Man</HI> in the Go&s;pel came to Him with his &s;erious Enqui|ries about Eternal Life, Je&s;us <HI>beheld him and loved him. Jo&s;eph</HI> was beloved of his God for his early Piety, and becau&s;e he fear'd to Sin again&s;t him in Private. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was honoured of God, and was taken into the neare&s;t and mo&s;t intimate Acquaintance with him becau&s;e he de&s;pis'd the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and cho&s;e to &s;uffer Affliction with the People of God God reveal'd him&s;elf to pious <HI>Samuel</HI> while he was yet a Child.

<P>The&s;e and many more &s;hining Examples might be produc'd. Look into your <HI>Bible</HI> and read them; and O that you might profit by reading them! But I cannot leave you without offering you one more, and that is the Incomparable Pattern and Example which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has left unto Young People to Copy after: O read his Life over and over, as it is given you by the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> and conform your's to it as far as po&s;&s;ible. Beg of him his Holy Spirit, and gracious A&s;&s;i&s;tances; and he will own your Endeavours and accept you. O how does God delight in the Blo&s;&s;oms of his Gardens! Their Scent is fragrant in his No&s;trils!</P>
<P>O <HI>My Dear,</HI> let me beg of you not to &s;pend any part of your precious Time in reading <HI>Romances</HI> or idle <HI>Poems,</HI> which tend only to rai&s;e fal&s;e <HI>Ideas</HI> and impure Images in the Mind, and leave a vile Tincture upon it.</P>

Have re&s;pect to all God's Commandments. Never dare to profane God's Name, or Sabbath. Be dutiful and &s;hew all Reverence to your Parents. O remem|ber the <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment; &s;tudy the Promi&s;es and Threatnings of it. Put away all Childi&s;h things. Behave your &s;elf Womanly, and like a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to all with whom you conver&s;e.

<P><PB N="112" REF="003888_0122_100397CA95AA3808">She writes that Company at &s;uch Sea&s;ons was very unwelcome and burden&s;ome, and bewails it that &s;he has been &s;ometimes hindred by it.</P>
<P>Her &s;trict and clo&s;e Examinations of her Self before the Sacrament are noted down. The <HI>Word of God</HI> was her Rule, and the Marks and Signs of a good and bad State there given are what &s;he judges upon.&mdash; I al&s;o find her making u&s;e of the Judgment of the be&s;t Divines &amp; Ca&s;ui&s;ts. &mdash;Two Books one for Devotion, &amp; the other for In&s;truction generally lay on her Table on Com|munion Days, namely Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s <HI>Chri&s;tian Sacrifice,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s <HI>Communicant</HI>'s <HI>Companion.</HI></P>
<P>In one of her Papers &s;he an&s;wers all Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s <HI>Que&s;tions,</HI> under the Head of Self-Examination; namely, What <HI>am</HI> I? What <HI>have I done?</HI> What am I <HI>doing?</HI> What ground do I <HI>get?</HI> What do <HI>I want?</HI> What do I <HI>re&s;olve</HI> to do? to her own Comfort and Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Her Frames</HI> at the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Table</HI> were very dif|ferent, but always con&s;i&s;tent with real and vital Religion.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he &s;eems overcome with <HI>Fears,</HI> and born down with Doubts and Scruples; but be|fore &s;he has fini&s;hed her Record there is an evi|dent Mourning after Chri&s;t, and an ardent Love to him di&s;coverable.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e which &s;he calls her <HI>uncomfor|table Sabbaths and Sacraments,</HI> others her <HI>plea&s;ant Days</HI> and <HI>joyful Communions.</HI> I ob&s;erve that when &s;he went laden with the mo&s;t Fear, &s;he generally brought home Comfort in return.</P>
<P>She writes once, <Q>I was exceeding dull and heavy, and ready to go away from the Sacra|ment, but when I had re&s;olved to &s;tay, I pre|&s;ently

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU were wi&s;hing la&s;t Night that I would in&s;truct you how to write <HI>Letters,</HI> which I willingly undertake to do by <HI>writing</HI> to You, and requiring you to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> me as often as I write. I know no Way of teaching you &s;o ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to me, and that may be &s;o profitable to you. I hope it will be a very great Plea&s;ure to you to hear from <HI>your Fa|ther</HI> often this Way, and to &s;peak to him again, and to have his loving Lines to you to read over again and again at your Lei&s;ure. Be&s;ides, Your <HI>li&s;ping</HI> at good Sen&s;e will be as <HI>Mu&s;ic</HI> to your Father's Ear, and much more your <HI>Growth</HI> the Joy of his Soul.</P>
<P>You need not be a&s;ham'd to let your Father &s;ee your Ig|norances and <HI>Defects,</HI> for to be &s;ure he'll kindly <HI>cover</HI> 'em, as well as <HI>inform</HI> you of 'em.</P>
<P>A very little <HI>U&s;e</HI> will make you Mi&s;tre&s;s eno' of the Art of decent, familiar, common Letters. <HI>Practice</HI> is the be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Way of learning this; and it will be well worth a little <HI>Pains</HI> to learn, being of con&s;tant <HI>U&s;e</HI> while you live, and not one of the lea&s;t <HI>Ornaments</HI> and Plea&s;ures of Life.</P>
<P>Write without Fear or Awe to <HI>Him</HI> who is your own, and who&s;e you are. Write more or le&s;s according as you find your Tho'ts flowing or re&s;trained. But always remember, that it is better to be <HI>&s;hort</HI> and full of good Sen&s;e, than to <HI>draw out</HI> your Letters to an empty Length.</P>
<P>Mine to you will be on one Head or other of Religious and Virtuous <HI>Conduct,</HI> wherein I &s;hall teach you the Fear of the <HI>Lord</HI> and the Care of your own <HI>Soul,</HI> which are the true and highe&s;t <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> I &s;hall breathe hereby into your Ear, and may it plea&s;e God into your Heart, many a good <HI>Wi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> for you to make over again for your Self. And may you find Grace from <HI>God,</HI> to make this Benefit of that tender Affection, which fills the Soul of your <HI>loving Father</HI> &mdash;&mdash;</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your's to me of this Week you ask my Tho'ts about that <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Page 52, &amp; 111.</NOTE> Text, 1 Cor. 11.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 29. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, &s;hall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to him&s;elf, not di&s;cerning the Lord's Body.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ay that it comforted you to find Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> &s;aying, <Q>That by <HI>Damnation</HI> here is not meant eternal Condemna|tion, but &s;ome temporal Judgment and Cha&s;ti&s;ement in order to the preventing the eternal Damnation.</Q>&mdash;This is no more than what you have often heard from me and other Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>It is certain that the <HI>Greek Word</HI> render'd here <HI>Damnation,</HI> &s;ignifies only <HI>Judgment</HI> in general, as the <HI>Margin</HI> of our Bibles renders it. And this Judgment is primarily meant of <HI>temporal</HI> Judgments; as it immediately follows, ver. 30, 31.32. <HI>For this Cau&s;e many an weak and &s;ickly among you, and many &s;leep; for if we would judge our &s;elves, we &s;hould not be judged: But when we are judged, we are cha&s;tned of the Lord, that we &s;hould not be condemned with the World.</HI></P>
<P>Here, my Dear, you have Mr. <HI>Flavel's</HI> Interpretation in the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s own Words: Scil, that <HI>temporal Judgment and Cha&s;ti&s;ement is the primary Meaning of that Text,</HI> and this <HI>in order to the preventing eternal Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But if you look into the <HI>Context,</HI> you will ea&s;ily &s;ee how <HI>gro&s;s and &s;oul</HI> the unworthy Eating among the <HI>Corinthians</HI> was. They acted after &s;uch a manner that the Apo&s;tle told them ver. 20. <HI>That it was not to eat the Lord's Supper.</HI> They
<PB N="125" REF="003888_0135_100398F47B76CF10">
did not <HI>di&s;cern the Lord's Body.</HI> They made a kind of <HI>common Meal</HI> of it. The Abu&s;e of their <HI>Love-Fea&s;ts,</HI> us'd before the Sacrament among them, was the Occa&s;ion hereof. The poor were neglected, every one <HI>took his own Supper; one was hungry and another was drunken</HI>! ver. 21. <HI>What,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Have ye not Hou&s;es to eat and drink in? or de&s;pi&s;e ye the Church of God</HI>? ver. 22. Here was gro&s;s Di&s;order indeed, even to In|temperance; &s;uch as is not like to be known among us. Wherefore, neither are the like temporal Judgments known among us on this Account, as were inflicted upon tho&s;e <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P>But if People do incur the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God by <HI>un&s;uitable partaking</HI> at the Lord's Table, Do they not equally by a <HI>carele&s;s Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> and irreverent and prophane <HI>Neglect</HI> of it, think you? Is not the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> the &s;ame? the <HI>Irreligion</HI> and Provo|cation the &s;ame? And &s;o may the <HI>Danger</HI> be ju&s;tly appre|hended.</P>
<P>Indeed either the <HI>"Omi&s;&s;ion or carele&s;s Performance</HI> of the holy Duties of God's Wor&s;hip, &s;ecret or publick, do ju&s;tly expo&s;e People to the Judgments of God, both bodily and &s;piritual, temporal and eternal. And the <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Judgments we &s;hould e&s;pecially fear. And if People habitually and pro|fanely and impenitently <HI>&s;tay away</HI> from the Lord's Table, or <HI>come</HI> to it; both the one and the other will turn to their <HI>Damnation</HI> in the World to come.</P>
<P>But what is the Inference or <HI>Argument</HI> from hence? Is it not that therefore we &s;hould religiou&s;ly <HI>prepare</HI> for, and re|verently <HI>come</HI> to the Ordinances of Chri&s;t? We mu&s;t nei|ther <HI>&s;tay away</HI> from them, nor <HI>prophane</HI> them in the U&s;e of them; for <HI>both</HI> of the&s;e Errors will alike incur the Judgment of God, here and hereafter, without Repentance</P>
<P>And think my <HI>Dear,</HI> Is it only by <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking un|worthily,</HI> that the Judgment of God is incurred? Is it not al&s;o by <HI>unworthy Praying</HI>? For it is &s;aid, That the <HI>Prayer</HI> of the wicked is an <HI>Abomination</HI> to the Lord. Is not <HI>this</HI> as dreadful as the Word <HI>Judgment</HI>? And do we not read of the <HI>Word Preached,</HI> that it will become a <HI>Savour of Death unto Death</HI> by our <HI>unworthy hearing</HI> it? Here is <HI>eternal</HI> Dam|nation indeed in the&s;e fearful words, <HI>Death unto Death.</HI> Let us fear then to <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>hear</HI> unworthily, as well as to <HI>eat</HI> unworthily. But to be &s;ure we may <HI>not</HI> &s;ay, "Well then, it is be&s;t <HI>not</HI> to pray at all, and be&s;t <HI>not</HI> to hear at all, le&s;t I bring Judgment and Condemnation upon my &s;elf: No more &s;hould we &s;ay&mdash;I will <HI>not</HI> dare to go to the Lord's Table for the &s;ame Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="003888_0136_100398FAA17E6AC8">In a word, If we prophane the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Chri&s;t, it will be to our Judgment, both on temporal and &s;piritual Accounts; and they will be prophaned by us, if they are not reverently ob&s;erved by us. The Rule there|fore is, ver. 28. <HI>Let a Man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI> So let a Man <HI>examine</HI> him&s;elf, and prepare for the <HI>other</HI> Ordinances of Chri&s;t. <HI>Keep thy foot when thou goe&s;t to the Hou&s;e of God, and offer not the Sacrifice of Fools who con&s;ider not that they do Evil.</HI> Be &s;o|lemn, &s;erious, and reverend in the <HI>whole</HI> wor&s;hip of God, for it is all <HI>holy,</HI> and God will be <HI>&s;anctifyed</HI> in it by us, or will &s;anctify him&s;elf upon us.</P>

<P>THE Face of the Sky this Morning, begins to forbid me the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you to Morrow. I would not have you expect me, nor that Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> &s;hould have the lea&s;t Dependance on me. I hope God will be with you in your <HI>open Giving your &s;elf</HI> to Him. The great thing lies <HI>in Secret,</HI> between God and your own Soul. The publick joyn|ing your &s;elf to the <HI>Church</HI> is but the doing that before Men, which you have fir&s;t done before God in &s;ecret. <HI>With the Heart Man believeth unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the Mouth Confe&s;&s;ion is made unto Salvation.</HI> If you &s;hould feel &s;ome Flutter and <HI>Di&s;order</HI> of Mind in public, let not that di&s;cour|age you: The Self-dedication was done <HI>&s;edately</HI> in &s;ecret. Yet I pray God to give you much <HI>Comfort,</HI> and the Tokens of his Grace and Pre&s;ence in the publick Tran&s;action. And may you live long to &s;erve God, and enjoy much of God in your Clo&s;et and al&s;o in his Hou&s;e, on <HI>Lord's-days</HI> and other Days; and be a Ble&s;&s;ing in your Place, both to Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> and to the People among whom your Lot is ca&s;t.</P>
