<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTORY PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WILL the Supreme Judge of the world, in the la&s;t day, &s;entence us to everla&s;ting life or puni&s;hment accord|ing to our characters formed in this &s;tate? So Chri&s;t hath ex|pre&s;sly taught us; and it is of mo&s;t intere&s;ting importance to every one, to know and realize it. This was the faith of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian church in the days of in&s;piration. This hath been the common faith of the Chri&s;tian church ever &s;ince. This was the faith of our pious forefathers in this land; and hath been the undi&s;puted faith of their po&s;terity, until the pre|&s;ent age. And con&s;idering the powerful, &s;alutary tendency and influence of this doctrine, for the good of men in this world and world to come, is it not to be lamented, that this important article of the Chri&s;tian faith, &s;hould be drawn into que&s;tion? But &s;o it is. The contrary doctrine, "that all men &s;hall be &s;aved," is now exhibited to public examination. &mdash;A clear &s;tage&mdash;fair dealing and argumentation&mdash;we a&s;k no more.&mdash;Great is the power of truth, and it will prevail.&mdash; Chri&s;t hath furni&s;hed his &s;ervants with &s;ufficient ability and faithfulne&s;s, from age to age, to vindicate the faith once deli|vered to the &s;aints; and to unma&s;k and expo&s;e error, however di&s;gui&s;ed by art and &s;ophi&s;ty; nor need we que&s;tion it in the pre&s;ent or any future day.</P>
<P>When I read the pamphlet, intitled, "Salvation for all Men," printed in Bo&s;ton, 1782, I viewed it as an opening wedge of controver&s;y; and thought it duty to turn my tho'ts upon the be&s;t method of defending the doctrine of the future pu|ni&s;hment, as commonly received in the Chri&s;tian world; which
<PB N="ii" REF="019737_0003_0FACA2D9A6B3DA28">
to me appeared, might as well be &s;upported as any doctrine of like importance, in divine revelation. The plan now ex|hibited, appeared well adapted to the purpo&s;e; and I had be|gun to write upon it before I knew of any an&s;wers to that pamphlet. Several an&s;wers have &s;ince appeared, which, in my judgment, are well executed upon their re&s;pective plans: And more is &s;aid than enough to an&s;wer that piece; the com|mon faith is &s;ub&s;tantially &s;upported in them: But the contro|ver&s;y doth not re&s;t. A much more laboured treati&s;e, in &s;up|port of that impladed tenet, is imported among us, printed in London, 1784. It requires an an&s;wer&mdash;none hath yet appear|ed; &mdash;and as the plan now exhibited, is very different from that of tho&s;e who have gone before me, and on that account may give the reader an advantage to &s;ee truth repre&s;ented and error expo&s;ed in various points of view; it is thought this publication may be needful and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t parts of it, have lain by me more than a year. Indeed, the &s;econd part was delivered in public di&s;cour&s;es, in the fall 1783, in a time of uncommon general &s;ickne&s;s in this place, which is the occa&s;ion of its appearance in the pre&s;ent form. Having turned my attention to the &s;ubject, and not knowing that I &s;hould live to publi&s;h any thing upon it, I thought it duty to endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h my hearers in a point of &s;o great importance. The public were notified in 1783, an ingenious work would be publi&s;hed, "wherein the &s;ubject is exhau&s;ted;" which I waited to &s;ee till October, 1784. The third part, is chiefly taken up in a reply to this, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the anonymous treati&s;e forementioned, intitled, "The my&s;tery hid from ages and generations, made manife&s;t by go&s;pel revelation: or, the &s;alvation of all men the grand thing aimed at in the &s;cheme of God, as opened in the New-Te&s;tament writings, and entru&s;ted with Je&s;us Chri&s;t to bring into effect:" Printed in London, 1784. It contains 406 pages, exclu&s;ive of the preface. It is wrote with ingenuity and much labour, with a di&s;play of learning and critical geni|us, with an appearance of much candour and benevolence; but with a &s;ufficient degree of contempt of the whole Chri&s;tian
<PB N="iii" REF="019737_0004_0FACA2DA64BFDA28">
world, papal and prote&s;tant, common annotators and Chri&s;tian writers, who differ from the author; accompanied with a va|riety of in&s;inuating arguments of addre&s;s, plau&s;ible argumen|tations, and preten&s;ions of good in the doctrine. Wherefore, if the author is mi&s;taken, and it is fitted only to e&s;tabli&s;h a ruinous error, the more plau&s;ibly it is wrote, it becomes the more en&s;naring and dangerous to the reader.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s, to give a &s;ketch of the general &s;cheme of doctrine in it; which I take to be this.&mdash;In re&s;pect to the doctrine of the Trinity, it is Ariani&s;m;&mdash;re&s;pecting that of imputation, Sociani&s;m;&mdash;in re&s;pect to the doctrines of grace as commonly called, Pelagiani&s;m;&mdash;in re&s;pect to the intermedi|ate &s;tate between death and the re&s;urrection, &s;o far as I can col|lect the &s;entiment, it better agrees with the Muggletonians than the common chri&s;tian doctrine;&mdash;in re&s;pect to the future judgment, it is &s;ingular; it will be final, and there will be no other public judgment; and yet it will not be deci&s;ive by un|alterably fixing the &s;tates of good or bad men; the &s;entences will never be rever&s;ed by any future judgment; and yet will be temporary, and not of perpetual and everla&s;ting force;&mdash; in re&s;pect to the future &s;tate after the la&s;t judgment, his tran&s;|mutation &s;tates better agrees with the notion of &s;ome of the old heathens than with the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, it being wholly unknown in the revelations of God.&mdash;And in his doctrine of purgatory, he &s;urpa&s;&s;es the popes, clergy, and church of Rome it&s;elf; for his begins after the la&s;t judgment, when theirs is ended.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e are the author's true &s;entiments, or only an adopted &s;cheme to &s;upport the doctrine of Univer&s;al Salvation, is not &s;o material to me or the reader; nor is it my de&s;ign to combat the&s;e principles any farther than the &s;ubject in debate is concerned; or the &s;ettling the con&s;truction of &s;ome di&s;puted texts may require. But it is thus &s;tated with a view to the&s;e two remarks: One is, tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in the firm belief of the contrary articles of the chri&s;tian faith, are in no great danger of becoming univer&s;ali&s;ts, on this plan; they would be great loo&s;ers by &s;uch a change: they mu&s;t &s;acrifice doctrines of far greater importance than this &s;illy error can be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="iv" REF="019737_0005_0FACA2DB292FF5E8">
to be. The other, and principal remark, is this: If this im|pleaded tenet cannot be &s;upported upon this plan, it is in vain to hope for it upon any other whatever. The ingenuity and ability of this writer is inconte&s;tible; and he hath &s;pared no labor and pains in the cau&s;e. He had all the world of doc|tines of truth and error to choo&s;e out of; and he hath taken his &s;tand of &s;upport and defence upon this foundation; and if he now fails of &s;upporting it, when enforced with all the aid of tho&s;e learned men, Mr. Whi&s;ton, Scot, Hartly, Hallet, &amp;c. and is re-enforced again with Gog and Magog, under the in|fluence of the devil, introduced to bring up the rear of &s;upport to one important part of the &s;cheme, it is in vain to hope it can ever be &s;upported upon any plan of doctrine whatever. In this &s;en&s;e, "the &s;ubject is truly exhau&s;ted." This being by far the mo&s;t plau&s;ibly wrote, in which their &s;trength is col|lected, and "the &s;ubject exhau&s;ted;" &s;hould it fail of &s;upport, the univer&s;ali&s;ts, if wi&s;e, for their own &s;ake, will not attempt to mend it, for the parts do now hang badly together, and &s;hould they jo&s;tle and alter the po&s;ts and pillars of it, the &s;u|per&s;tructure certainly falls to ruin with its own weight. Whe|ther it be now &s;upported, or is &s;upportable by any means whatever; the reader who carefully attends to the following work in all the parts of it, may be under &s;ome advantage to judge. One thing, perhaps, &s;hould not be wholly pa&s;&s;ed over, and may be noticed here, ina&s;much as it did not naturally fall in any where in the la&s;t part. We are told, in order to the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of this &s;cheme, "&s;ome generally received doctrines mu&s;t be given up, and that it is high time they &s;hould be re|nounced and others embraced in their room, more honourable to the father of mercies, and comfortable to the creatures whom his hands have formed." Page 14. What are the articles to be embraced in the room of tho&s;e of the chri&s;tian and prote&s;t|ant faith, which are to be renounced? Why, it &s;eems, we are to receive it as a fir&s;t principle, that the end of the creation of the moral world was the happine&s;s of the creature; and that if God foreknew any of them (&s;ay the devil and his angels and the finally wicked of mankind) would, by the abu&s;e of their
<PB N="v" REF="019737_0006_0FACA2DBE7908270">
moral powers, render them&s;elves finally mi&s;erable, that them he &s;hould have withheld from them "the gift of exi&s;tence." Page 1&s;t and 3d. Is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the&s;e notions with God's &s;ending his Son into the world to teach us the everla&s;t|ing fire and puni&s;hment prepared for the devil and his angels, to which he will &s;entence both them and the finally wicked, in the la&s;t day? Will it not follow from this notion, compared with this doctrine Chri&s;t taught, that God &s;ent his Son to teach the world, he would make the&s;e creatures mi&s;erable, contrary to the end for which he made them, and when he &s;hould have with|held their exi&s;tence? Is not this de&s;truction to the character of the Father and the Son? The&s;e new world makers, and tran&s;mutation &s;tates makers, are, it &s;eems, va&s;t projectors. They can project &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential change in the nature of things, as to transfer the obligations of the creature to the creator; and of the &s;inner to the Saviour: &s;o that if the rebellious creature peri&s;heth in his iniquity, the reflection of di&s;honor &s;hall be ca&s;t upon the Creator and Saviour. Suppo&s;e infinite wi&s;dom, pow|er and goodne&s;s doth not exert it&s;elf in new created worlds, tran&s;mutation &s;tates, and effectual mea&s;ures of human inven|tion for the reduction and &s;alvation of all the rebellious, &s;hall the Creator and Lord of the world be reflected on as defective in benevolence? as not de&s;iring the &s;alvation of his creatures? and as doing what ought not to be done, in giving them exi&s;t|ence? Or, if the Saviour doth not &s;ave all who will not come unto him for life, &s;hall di&s;honor be reflected on him as not ex|ecuting his tru&s;t, becau&s;e they peri&s;h for their faults? Is there any foundation in the &s;cripture doctrine as commonly receiv|ed, for &s;uch ab&s;urd conclu&s;ions and ba&s;e reflections? Is not eternal life God's gift? Are not his gifts his own? May he not do what he will with his own? Doth not rebellion forfeit this gift? May not the wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good Governor of the World puni&s;h the rebellious according to de&s;ert? The&s;e &s;elf-evident truths, are &s;ufficient to &s;ettle this point. I can &s;ee no &s;ervice done to God or man, by &s;uch "fal&s;e philo&s;ophy and vain deceit." What honor or &s;ervice can it be to the Mo&s;t High? We are too late by almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and years to be
<PB N="vi" REF="019737_0007_0FACA2DCA75B5140">
of coun&s;el to the infinitely wi&s;e God, to teach him for what end to create the world, whom to create, and from whom to withhold exi&s;tence; and what new worlds and tran&s;mutation &s;tates to make for the recovery of the rebellious, &amp;c. The divine plan of creation is &s;ettled by the infinitely wi&s;e God, according to the council of his own will, and carried into exe|cution. And he hath taught us the grand end de&s;igned, viz. m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al government in its infinitely important connections, as hereafter &s;tated and illu&s;trated. And this plan of moral go|vernment, in which the righteous will be rewarded and the wicked puni&s;hed, in final i&s;&s;ue, hath already exi&s;ted in opera|tion almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and years, is now carrying into execution, will remain forever, and be compleated in highe&s;t perfecti|on and glory. Neither can the&s;e notions be any more &s;er|vice for the real good, comfort and happine&s;s of mankind: they cannot inforce the important requi&s;itions of duty in the law and go&s;pel of God, wherein is found the true good, com|fort and happine&s;s of mankind; for the great commandments of love and duty in the law, and of faith, repentance,&amp;c. in the go&s;pel, all proceed upon this &s;uppo&s;ition and ground&mdash;that God hath an ab&s;olute right to govern and give law to the cre|ation&mdash;that the creature is &s;ervant to the creator, and not the creator to the creature&mdash;and that duty and obligation lies wholly on the creature, and if he rebels and makes him&s;elf mi|&s;erable, the fault and blame is in the creature and not in the creator; in the unbelieving and di&s;obedient &s;inner, and not in the Saviour. And it is &s;trange, that &s;uch vain &s;peculations and ba&s;e reflections, are not long ago &s;ilenced and bani&s;hed the chri&s;tian world, by the&s;e clear dictates of rea&s;on, by the re|peated appeals of God to it; "are not my ways equal and yours unequal;" by the perpetual doctrine of revelation, eve|ry where expre&s;sly laying the fault upon the creature: "The wicked that is warned but continues in his wickedne&s;s, &s;hall die in his iniquity, and his blood &s;hall be upon him:" "If thou be wi&s;e, thou &s;halt be wi&s;e for thy&s;elf; but if thou &s;corn|e&s;t thou alone &s;halt bear it." "Thou alone," and not the Creator and Saviour, &s;halt bear the blame and reproach with
<PB N="vii" REF="019737_0008_0FACA2DD66603030">
the puni&s;hment:" And above all by the oath of God purpo&s;e|ly clearing him&s;elf from all &s;uch impious in&s;inuations, &s;ugge&s;|tions and reflections: "As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn and live:" "Turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?" It would be a hard ca&s;e for any to &s;tand upon &s;uch terms with their maker, as not to credit the oath of God, unle&s;s he would plea&s;e their fancy in their invented, new created worlds, and tran&s;mutati|on &s;tates, which may be very contrary to his all-wi&s;e arrange|ment of things, in his everla&s;ting kingdom. Is it honorable to the Father of Mercies, to take up the cau&s;e of the devil and his angels, and of wicked men, again&s;t God? Hath he commi|&s;&s;ioned any one to teach the world, if the&s;e creatures are final|ly mi&s;erable in their rebellion, the creator &s;hould have with|held their exi&s;tence? Judas, for in&s;tance, will be finally mi&s;e|rable, if ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord's words be true: "It had been good for that man if he had not been born." God foreknew this: Will any &s;ay to God, he &s;hould have withheld the gift of exi&s;tence to him? Will he &s;ay, this very man was born an expectant of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality, upon a foundation which cannot di&s;ap|point him? con&s;equently that our &s;aviour's words cannot be true; or, if verified in the execution of this woe, Judas will be deprived of his birthright inheritance &s;ecured upon a foundati|on which cannot fail. Will he teach as their "hone&s;t Mr. Whi&s;ton," the puni&s;hment is cruel both in the threatning and execution; and that God mu&s;t give up his ju&s;tice, and much more, his mercy in &s;uch execution, if Judas be finally and for|ever mi&s;erable? Did God &s;end his &s;on into the world to teach a doctrine fal&s;e and incredible, as they make this to be, and thereby to de&s;troy the character of the Father and the Son? Can &s;uch teaching be for the good of mankind? Doth it tend to inforce their obedience, and promote their comfort and hap|pine&s;s? Yea, doth it not tend directly to &s;trengthen the bands of wickedne&s;s? Can it comfort the wicked for man to tell them happine&s;s is their end, when the God of truth repeatedly declares "their end is de&s;truction?"</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions carry their own an&s;wers in them, and plain|ly
<PB N="viii" REF="019737_0009_0FACA2DE25B87A98">
&s;hew, that the&s;e men run with their maxims and rea&s;onings "of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy and vain deceit," before they are &s;ent. And it is very likely, if the prophet Ezekiel was now alive, he would give us a new edition of that &s;olemn me&s;&s;age from God, he addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ome of the prophets in his day: "With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous &s;ad, whom I have not made &s;ad; and &s;trengthened the hands of the wicked that he &s;hould not turn from his wicked way, by promi&s;ing him life." Ezek. 13.22. Will any one &s;ay, in the face of this declaration from God, "that the promi&s;ing him life doth not &s;trengthen the bands of wickedne&s;s, and harden the wicked in it, that he &s;hould not return from his wicked way?" Be|&s;ides, if the happine&s;s of the creature be the ultimate end of creation, every man may make his own plea&s;ure and happi|ne&s;s his ultimate end; and what wicked work this would make in this &s;inful world, notwith&s;tanding all the grave cau|tions and councils given again&s;t it, any man of di&s;cernment and reflection may ea&s;ily &s;ee. The reader may, I think, find this notion well expo&s;ed and confuted in Bi&s;hop Butler's Ana|logy. I &s;peak this from memory, not having the book by me, and it is, perhaps, twenty years &s;ince I read it.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;The&s;e projectors give us a very different, my&s;te|rious plan of Salvation, which we are to embrace "in the room" of our former faith. And it is &s;aid no man is a com|petent judge of it "who has not often read over the New-Te&s;tament in the language in which it was wrote, and &s;tudi|ed Paul's epi&s;tles for a con&s;iderable time, &amp;c."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Preface, p. 8, 9.</NOTE> This looks &s;u&s;picious. It mu&s;t be a very different plan from "that &s;trait and narrow way of life," and tho&s;e terms of "life and death" taught by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, which are very plain. This highway of &s;alvation is made &s;o plain, that it is written "wayfaring men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein." The character of the two plans, the one given by in&s;piration, and the other by them&s;elves, &s;hew they cannot be the &s;ame; and we are not prepared to "renounce" the old and true go&s;|pel for any other. This projected plan, is to &s;ave the finally rebellious, in &s;ome future new-created worlds and tran&s;muta|tion
<PB N="ix" REF="019737_0010_0FACA2E0206C0C80">
&s;tates, and by more effectual means than the go&s;pel affords. At fir&s;t &s;ight, Is this go&s;pel, or infidelity? It is liable to &s;trong objections, and we &s;hall hereafter &s;hew it, &s;elf-confuted. It is &s;ufficient here to &s;ay, the&s;e projectors have not creating wi&s;dom and power, and cannot bring the&s;e new worlds, &s;tates and effectual mea&s;ures into exi&s;tence and effect, and give them reality: and it is clear from revelation the Almighty will not. Again, this plan is, as ab&s;olutely unknown and excluded divine revelation; as, "the invented tales of fairy land" and there|fore, as chri&s;tians who&s;e faith is founded on and ab&s;olutely bounded by &s;cripture, we have nothing to do with it, but to re|ject it as vain and delu&s;ive. Further, let no one put any tru&s;t in it, for if the go&s;pel con&s;titution be confirmed in the day of judgment; which is as certain as there is truth in the word of God: there is not the lea&s;t chance of &s;ecurity to them on this plan, which is directly oppo&s;ite to that con&s;titution: the con|firming the one, is the everla&s;ting overthrow of the other.</P>
<P>Moreover, their piety and benevolence &s;eems to need great correction. True piety teaches us a hearty acquie&s;cence in the all wi&s;e, perfect government of God, exhibited in &s;cripture&mdash;as founded in perfect wi&s;dom, immutable truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s; and conducted by wi&s;e laws, con&s;titutions and terms of mercy; and enforced by mo&s;t wi&s;e promi&s;es and threatnings; and to be &s;ettled in the day of judgment in a &s;tate of final re|tribution. True piety and benevolence, influences the &s;ubjects of it to pious endeavours to &s;upport the authority and govern|ment of God, the requi&s;itions of the law and go&s;pel, and the promi&s;es and threatnings of God in all their force; and to en|deavour the repentance of &s;inful men, and their reconciliation to God, upon the merciful terms of his divine con&s;titution only. But where do we find piety and benevolence exerci&s;ed in taking up the cau&s;e of his enemies again&s;t God? In &s;up|porting the pre&s;umptuous hopes of the wicked again&s;t the force of his threatnings? In taking up, arguing and &s;upporting their objections, and thereby &s;trengthening their mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, hard thoughts and prejudices again&s;t the character of God as illu&s;trated, and the government of God as it will be &s;ettled in
<PB N="x" REF="019737_0011_0FACA2E066CA82F0">
the day of judgment? By teaching them, if they are final|ly mi&s;erable in their rebellion, and "de&s;truction be their end," as the &s;cripture con&s;tantly teacheth, that God &s;hould have withheld their exi&s;tence? And let them be ever &s;o vile and abominable in their treatment of their Creator and Saviour, if, after their ob&s;tinate rejection of life and &s;alvation in this world, he doth not create new worlds and tran&s;mutation &s;tates, and u&s;e effectual mea&s;ures for the recovery of all the rebellious, that di&s;honours will be reflected upon the adorable Creator and Saviour? Certainly we find no &s;uch doctrines taught, no &s;uch in&s;inuations given out, nor any &s;uch "piety and benevo|lence" exemplified by Mo&s;es and the prophets, by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, or any &s;aint of God, on &s;cripture record, which are our &s;tandard to judge by. Doth it not &s;avour more of the &s;pirit of Cain, of the murmuring I&s;raelites, and of the wicked of the earth, than of the true &s;aints of God? And can &s;uch pi|ety and benevolence be genuine in its direction, operation and fruit? Such zeal is prepo&s;terou&s;ly ab&s;urd. And that rebuke, immediately from God, merits our attention, and &s;hould put and keep us upon guard: "&s;hall he that contendeth with the Almighty in&s;truct him? he that reproveth God, let him an&s;wer it." Job 40.2. This was effectual with holy Job. In a word, let it be noted, it is not here and there a detached arti|cle of the chri&s;tian faith that mu&s;t be renounced, but we mu&s;t give up the doctrine of the cro&s;s&mdash;the con&s;titution of nature&mdash; and the revealed con&s;titution of God, to embrace this new creed; as will hereafter appear. Surely no good chri&s;tians, who love not their lives to the death for the word of God and te&s;timony of Je&s;us, can do this. The people of this land, in this enlightened age, are certainly better in&s;tructed than to do it; unle&s;s heads of families and go&s;pel mini&s;ters are far more to blame than I believe them to be, in not duly educating and teaching them. It is plain therefore, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly go over to them. What &s;hall be done to compromi&s;e the matter, to &s;ettle the controver&s;y, and bring us to unity in the faith?</P>

Let us renounce the following rules of &s;ophi&s;try and fal&s;e argumen|tation, viz. all attempt to correct the doctrine of revelation, by our prejudicate or invented notions of rea&s;on: for the &s;crip|ture is given to correct the&s;e, and not to be corrected by them.

The&s;e fal&s;e rules, duly noticed, will give the reader an opportunity of judging upon the merits of this di&s;pute, and of the force of what is here written and &s;ub|mitted to his judgment.

<P>I am no enemy to the univer&s;ali&s;ts, although they may ac|count me one, becau&s;e, with all freedom, I tell them the truth.

Mr. Whi&s;ton &s;ugge&s;ts; that only weak enthu&s;ia&s;ts and divines, bigoted to topi|cal orthodoxy, and deficient in real &s;agacity and true judgment, could freely preach the common doctrine. Mr. White, in his charity, &s;tiles them "mi&s;tical Jews." Mr. Reily, in his civility, &s;tiles his opponents "barking ears." Another inferior author, &s;peaks of them as having the vail on their hearts, and blinded by the God of this world. A more po|lite writer, who reveres the piety of our forefathers, yet exhibits them as a &s;et of idolatars, portraying the God they wor&s;hip "de&s;titute of truth and &s;incerity," which cannot be the true God. And the humble, "pious" Dr. Hartly affects a &s;uperiority over "the &s;acred writers them&s;elves," to give us a more full meaning of "their glorious declarations" than their con|tracted minds under&s;tood. And this benevolent writer, in his candour, judges that the chri&s;tian world, prote&s;tant as well as papal, that differ from him in the&s;e points, receive, for &s;cripture truths, as gro&s;s ab&s;urdities and palpably wrong and di&s;honourable ideas of God, as infidels in the dark ages and places of pagani&s;m. p. 362, 3. The&s;e a&s;&s;uming, confu&s;|ing, contemning aire, are apt to make undue impre&s;&s;ions upon weak minds; for which rea&s;on they are noticed. Timid an&s;wers would rather fa&s;ten than remove the ill impre&s;&s;ions. Whether the&s;e "airs" be de&s;igned as a weapon of policy, like Briti&s;h proclamations, to force us by their terror to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ilence, or are owing to the evil &s;pirit of the error it&s;elf, I pre&s;ume not to determine.

Bi&s;hop Sher|lock, Dr. Clark, and Dr. Tayler, are applauded by this author; and &s;cores and hundreds might be added to the li&s;t. The&s;e writers are merciful, perhaps, without de&s;ign, amid&s;t their &s;everity: for they have left us, join|ed in one faith, in the be&s;t of company, with the patriarchs and prophets, our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, and all the &s;aints of God, jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian, in the days of in&s;piration; it being conceded, in their note p. 253, "that the in&s;pired writers did not under&s;tand the full meaning of their glorious declarations:" that is, they did not under&s;tand the doctrine and &s;cheme of the&s;e men. This is in effect giving up the point in di&s;pute. The con|te&s;t is plainly between the in&s;pired teachers and writers, and the&s;e men; and no con&s;i&s;tent revelationi&s;t can doubt in &s;uch a conte&s;t, who&s;e plan and doctrine will be approved and who&s;e will be condemned in the great day.</P>
<P>That all wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s is not the prerogative peculiar of the&s;e men, one may infer from the character they give of their body. If we credit the te&s;timony they give one of another, we mu&s;t believe in the ex|cellent Mr. White, the pious Dr. Hartly, and the hone&s;t Mr. Whi&s;ton, but the rear of this little army is not &s;o re&s;pectable as the front; for we are told "a very con&s;iderable number of divines, at this day, do not be|lieve in the eternity of hell torments, though they may not di&s;clo&s;e their minds to the vulgar, but for political rea&s;ons, &s;uffer it to pa&s;s among them that they do believe it." p. 354.

A prophet of their own, announces, "that modern prudence is the fal&s;e wi&s;dom condemned by our Saviour; and that the vulgar arts of concealment are equally unworthy the &s;cholar, the divine, and the chri&s;tian."

or &s;uch palpable errors and ab&s;urdities, as now pa&s;s in the world, could not be endured. It &s;eems requi&s;ite to touch and wind up the&s;e &s;prings to their proper tone of &s;en&s;ibility, that truth and error may be quickly di&s;cerned, and in &s;uch force as the one may be readily received and the other rejected. Add to this, it is very pernicious to the credit and u&s;e of divine reve|lation, to render the language of &s;cripture "&s;ceptical and un|certain." It directly tends to &s;ceptici&s;m, and to deteat the practical de&s;ign of revelation. For &s;hould we e&s;cape the dreadful gulph of &s;ceptici&s;m, yet, if your principles hang loo&s;e|ly in the wavering mind, as the cloaths upon the body, they cannot be &s;o realizingly believed as to effect the grand practi|cal intention. Wherefore, I have endeavoured to give the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture upon &s;uch plain principles of rea&s;on and &s;crip|ture, as that truth &s;hould carrry it's own evidence with it to fa&s;ten it: and to exhibit truth and error in &s;uch plainne&s;s and force, as &s;eems fitted to induce a belief of the truth and impre&s;s the influence of it. Might I happily &s;ucceed, to fix any that are &s;ceptical, &s;ettle the wavering, confirm the believer, &s;uccour the endangered, and throw out any thoughts that any of our opponents may improve upon for their conviction and recove|ry from what I am fully per&s;uaded to be very dangerous error, I &s;hould account it among the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of my life.</P>
<P>It is common for errori&s;ts, and our opponents in particular, to deal much in the mo&s;t difficult parts of &s;cripture: here are their &s;trong holds&mdash;the current doctrine of revelation is direct|ly again&s;t them.

fails, we fail where wi&s;er and greater men have failed before us. It avails but little to produce the &s;entiments of eminent divines and other great and good writers who have gone before us, be|cau&s;e, tho&s;e we have to deal with look down upon the re&s;t of the chri&s;tian world. However, it may not be ami&s;s to make &s;ome trial of it. And I know of no celebrated American author who&s;e known ability and candour, would more recommend him to their attentive notice, than the Rev. Dr. Charles Chauncy of Bo&s;ton. I have accordingly &s;elected a number of things out of his writings, in &s;upport of the common con&s;truction and faith. As one or two pa&s;&s;ages out of his &s;ermons "breaking of bread in remembrance of the dying love of Chri&s;t, a go&s;pel in&s;titution;" printed in Bo&s;ton 1772. Several pa&s;&s;ages out of his "&s;ea&s;onable thoughts;" printed in Bo&s;ton 1743. But the pa&s;&s;ages are chiefly collected out of his &s;ermons upon ju&s;tifi|cation &mdash;the nature of faith, &amp;c. printed in Bo&s;ton 1765. In the&s;e &s;ermons, in my opinion, there is more &s;ound divinity and conclu&s;ive rea&s;onings, than in all the writings of the univer|&s;ali&s;ts I have ever &s;een, and as I believe were ever wrote. If they hear him not, it is in vain to hope their conviction from any other. As to the plan of rea&s;oning and illu&s;trating the points in controver&s;y, pur&s;ued in the following work, if executed by one who was ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject, and had lei&s;ure for the pur|po&s;e, I am fully &s;atisfied, it would bring forth the truth with the force of moral demon&s;tration, according to the nature of the &s;ubject. I have often wi&s;hed, for the truth's &s;ake, it had been in the hand of one of greater ability and more lei&s;ure; that full ju&s;tice might have been done to the &s;ubject, and the world have had the benefit of &s;uch a demon&s;tration. I pre&s;ume not to &s;ay, it is now &s;o executed; it was next to impo&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t my avocations and embarra&s;&s;ments, by the uncommon general &s;ickne&s;s that hath prevailed here for the two la&s;t years, and continual &s;ickne&s;s in my own family. This may have &s;ome weight with the candid reader, to excu&s;e the inaccuracies and imperfections he may di&s;cern in this work.</P>
<P>Had I &s;een the treati&s;e remarked upon in the third part, be|fore I wrote the others, it would have produced &s;ome alterati|ons,
<PB N="xvi" REF="019737_0017_0FACA2E4ECBD8D60" MS="y">
&s;o as to have prevented &s;ome repetitions that become now unavoidable, without detriment to the &s;ubject. Other altera|tions, I am &s;en&s;ible, might be made for the better. The argu|ments, in &s;ome places, might be enforced; and in others, new arguments, perhaps as forcible with the reader, might be added. But in my &s;ituation, I cannot take the trouble of tran&s;cribing and altering: the world mu&s;t have it as it is, or not at all in proper &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to take up the &s;cheme and &s;entiments of the author truly, and to reply to his arguments in their force; and to con&s;ider every text and argument which appeared &s;o weighty as materially to effect the controver&s;y; not troubling my&s;elf or the reader with others. If any are omitted the rea|der may judge weighty, they either e&s;caped my notice, or were thought to be immaterial, or not difficult to a reader of com|mon good judgment.</P>
<P>I read this treati&s;e with candour, in this &s;en&s;e, viz. without any di&s;po&s;ition to find needle&s;s fault, or in matters of little con&s;equence; but I confe&s;s I had no expectation of being con|vinced by his arguments. A rule of judging of doctrines founded in rea&s;on and revelation, which I have long u&s;ed, for|bids &s;uch an expectation. The rule is this: "A doctrine that in the very face of it carries de&s;truction to the moral character and government of God, or to natural and revealed religion, or to the character of our Saviour, cannot be from God." This rule is grounded on this evident rea&s;on: we have &s;tronger evi|dence in &s;upport of the&s;e, than we have of a contrary doctrine. And the &s;pirit and force of this rule, whereby to judge of and reject &s;uch manife&s;t error without he&s;itation, is given by Mo|&s;es, Deut. 13th chapter. Let a doctrine that hath this cha|racter written in the face of it, come recommended to us with ever &s;o much plau&s;ibility of learning, critici&s;m, philo&s;ophy, me|taphy&s;icks, preten&s;ions of good, &s;eeming force of argument, or preten&s;ions of miracles it&s;elf, we are in&s;tantly to reject it without he&s;itation; whether we can &s;ee through the &s;ophi&s;try and fal|licy of it's &s;upport or not. This author &s;ays true, "it is im|po&s;&s;ible that &s;hould come from God which is unworthy
<PB N="xvii" REF="019737_0018_0FACA2E5AE05B148">
of him:" although he wrongly applies it. p. 361. Now, this impleaded doctrine, carries this character of fal&s;hood in the very face of it; and in the con&s;truction given to &s;acred texts to &s;upport it. "That the wicked &s;hould be as happy as the righteous in final i&s;&s;ue, in a &s;tate of final retribution, is de|&s;truction to the moral character and government of God." Every trace of wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, truth and goodne&s;s in character and government, is de&s;troyed in &s;uch a doctrine. There is no government&mdash;it is ab&s;olute confu&s;ion where good and bad fare alike in final i&s;&s;ue. And the &s;cripture is in no|thing more plain and deci&s;ive, than that, in final i&s;&s;ue, "it &s;hall go well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked." Again, it is de&s;truction to natural and revealed religion, by de&s;troying the principles and motives whereby only it can be &s;upported, viz. rewards and puni&s;hments, rendered in final i&s;|&s;ue, according to characters formed in a &s;tate of trial. Take away this inforcement, and a&s;&s;ign one end to the whole human race, (whatever their characters be,) whether univer&s;al, annihi|lation, or univer&s;al happine&s;s, all idea of rational government, and all rational &s;upport of religion, natural and revealed, are no more. If you teach men, that God will not finally deter|mine their &s;tate by "the terms of life and death" he hath ap|pointed to them in this world, what is there left to inforce obe|dience? Further, our Saviour hath given us a copy of the &s;en|tence he will pronounce upon the righteous and wicked in the la&s;t day, to fix our faith, and form our hearts and lives by it. Now, to &s;uppo&s;e he hath given it in &s;uch ambiguity, that we can never be certain of the true meaning of it, and what we are to believe;&mdash;in &s;uch ambiguity as is mo&s;t likely to be mi&s;taken, &s;o that, perhaps, ninety-nine of a hundred, in all ages, have in fact mi&s;taken it;&mdash;in &s;uch ambiguity, that the true meaning, viz. "an age of happine&s;s and puni&s;hment," hath never been hit upon for more than &s;eventeen hundred years after it was delivered to the world:&mdash;I &s;ay, to &s;uppo&s;e this, is ab&s;olute de&s;truction to the character of Chri&s;t, as a pro|phet and judge. For no wi&s;e teacher would attempt to fix the faith of his hearers; and no wi&s;e judge would deliver a ca|pital
<PB N="xviii" REF="019737_0019_0FACA2E66E458138">
&s;entence with &s;uch amazing ambiguity, as that it might be &s;eventeen hundred years before any one would under&s;tand and be able to fix the &s;en&s;e of it. It is infinitely unworthy of the great prophet, light and judge of the world to do it. We know, therefore, previous to critical examination, that all their learn|ed labour to render this &s;entence &s;ceptical and ambiguous, to|gether with their con&s;truction it&s;elf, mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely wrong; whether we can di&s;cover the error and &s;ophi&s;try of it or not. We know, from the nature of the &s;ubject, the &s;entence is given without ambiguity, in &s;uch deci&s;ive words and manner, as was ea&s;y and certain to be under&s;tood in that day. And it would have remained without ambiguity to this day, but for the ill-judged and ill-concerted labours of &s;ome learned men. Cer|tainly, I can no more believe in a con&s;truction which de&s;troys the character of our Saviour, as a prophet and judge, than I can in infidelity or athei&s;m it&s;elf. This is a rule of judging of doctrines that is &s;elf-evidently right. And it ought to be the &s;trong hold of common chri&s;tians, who are unable to &s;ee thro' &s;ubtle, &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;onings in &s;upport of doctrines obviou&s;ly de&s;tructive of the character of God, and of our Saviour, and of the divine government, and &s;ubver&s;ive of "the faith once deli|vered to the &s;aints." But it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e "who are &s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel" to endeavour to detect the error of their critici&s;ms, and of their rules of con&s;truction, with the falla|cy of their rea&s;onings: and bring to view &s;uch plain deci&s;ive rules of true con&s;truction, as to fix and &s;ettle us firmly "in the faith once delivered to the &s;aints." This is attempted in the follow|ing work, with what &s;ucce&s;s is left with the reader to judge.</P>
<P>In fine, I have nothing more at heart, than that both readers and writers may be thoroughly led into the truth as it is in Chri&s;t; and may, by the grace of God, be formed to a pre&s;ent choice of that good part in Chri&s;t which will never be taken away: that we peri&s;h not in the perdition of the ungodly in the great day; but may then, with the redeemed and &s;anctified of this world, inherit that kingdom prepared for them before the foundation of the world.</P>

and corruption, brought forth in a degenerate age like ours. This argument, in&s;tead of force to induce our belief, carries a refutation and condemnation of the doctrine in it. In our turn, we give one &s;tating of the antiquity of it more deci|&s;ive. We aver it the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ruinous error ever broach|ed in the world, and re&s;t the proof on Gen. 3. 1 to the 6. "And the &s;erpent &s;aid unto the woman, ye &s;hall not &s;urely die; for God doth know, that in the day that ye eat thereof, then your eyes &s;hall be opened; and ye &s;hall be as Gods knowing good and evil." v. 4 and 5. The doctrine is obviou&s;ly the &s;ame in both parts of it, viz. a full denial that mankind &s;hould &s;uffer the death in the threatning&mdash;the full wages of &s;in&mdash; "ye &s;hall not &s;urely die"&mdash;with as full a promi&s;e and a&s;&s;uring declaration (di&s;obedience notwith&s;tanding) they &s;hould be tran&s;cendently happy, "as Gods, knowing good and evil." The &s;ame &s;ubtil in&s;inuation of incredibility, as well as full de|nial of the truth and threatning of God, is u&s;ed to introduce both &s;chemes into the world. The old &s;erpent well knew the firm belief of the threatning mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;ubverted before he could bring on &s;eduction and di&s;obedience. He fir&s;t addre&s;|&s;es the &s;trong in&s;inuation of incredibility, to unhinge the mind and &s;hake the foundation of faith; then follows it with a full audacious denial to overthrow it: "And he &s;aid unto the wo|man, yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden?" v. 1. A &s;tartling que&s;tion. Can &s;uch a prohibition come from a God all goodne&s;s? and inforced too with &s;uch an awful penalty as death, an eternal exclu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? It exceeds all belief. In&s;inuation having done its work, gained attention: he follows it with a full denial; "Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die." In this we have the &s;trength of the whole cau&s;e, in both &s;chemes. For this in&s;inuation and argument of incredibility, may alike be inforced with the very &s;ame arguments and way of arguing, in both &s;chemes. The &s;ame objections of incredibility are as full again&s;t the fir&s;t threatning as the re&s;t, in the book of God. It may be &s;aid and argued, that &s;uch a tremendous threatning as death &s;hould ever be executed "exceeds all belief;" becau&s;e man, a finite crea|ture, cannot commit a &s;in of &s;uch infinite ill demerit, as to de|&s;erve
<PB N="3" REF="019737_0022_0FACA2E8A4C48578">
an eternal exclu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. That the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a moment cannot amount to &s;uch an eternal forfeiture and puni&s;hment. That one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, "in eat|ing of the forbidden fruit," &s;hould incur death upon the fir&s;t pa|rents, and &s;ubject millions of millions of his offspring to &s;in, and to calamity and death, to reign for ages and to the end of the world, exceeds comprehen&s;ion and belief. It may be ob|jected to be incon&s;i&s;tent with divine benevolence&mdash;a God all goodne&s;s&mdash;with the end of creation&mdash;the happine&s;s of the creature: and it may be as &s;trongly urged on the one &s;cheme as the other, that God's plan is an univer&s;al plan; uni|ver&s;al good, univer&s;al happine&s;s, and the rich abounding pro|vi&s;ion in creation for man and bea&s;t, might be adduced as proof of it. Moreover, the argument for the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of all men, in their way of arguing, is alike forcible from "the tree of life" as from the mediator and atonement. God made provi&s;ion of eternal life for man, of which he gave an a&s;&s;uring pledge "in the tree of life;" and none can doubt it all-&s;ufficient. The provi&s;ion is made for man, (i. e.) as they argue, for "all men:" all that come under the denomination of men, &s;tand in the &s;ame near and tender relation, and have intere&s;t in God as their common father; &s;o that all are under an equally gra|cious council and de&s;ign of eternal life. It is then a pledge of eternal life, for man, i.e. all men, the whole world, and will admit of no clippings, di&s;tinctions, or exceptions of elect or non-elect, Jew or Gentile, innocent or di&s;obedient, &s;aint or &s;in|ner; and the conclu&s;ion is clear, if the provi&s;ion and pledge be for all, all &s;hall eventually enjoy eternal life: for if he hath made &s;uch provi&s;ion, he is de&s;irous of their everla&s;ting felicity; and it mu&s;t follow that they &s;hall attain it. What &s;hould hin|der it? Our wi&s;hes may be fru&s;trated, but God cannot be di&s;|appointed. It is annihilating his omnipotence to &s;ay he can|not effect it, if he de&s;ires it. It is inconceivable that any &s;hould peri&s;h everla&s;tingly. "His infinite wi&s;dom, power and good|ne&s;s forbid &s;uch a di&s;honourable &s;uppo&s;ition." If he de&s;ires it, he wills it; and his will is "efficacious, uncontroulable, and irri&s;i&s;table." Yea, his will and work is one;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salvation for all men, p. 6, 7, ibid p. 6. and Divine Glory in the Salvation of all men, p. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> it is as al|ready

done; and we may anticipate the great event, and con|gratulate all mankind upon their future pro&s;pect&mdash;univer&s;al, everla&s;ting happine&s;s. The argument runs alike ea&s;y, &s;mooth, and forcible upon both &s;chemes. And it is of importance to remark, the &s;ame foundation error doth attend both &s;chemes, and ruins all their arguments in &s;upport of them, viz. That this promi&s;e and a&s;&s;urance of life, is held out in both, not only in di&s;connection with, but in direct oppo&s;ition to the terms of life appointed of God to men in this life. The appointed terms of life in this world are excluded and &s;et a&s;ide in both &s;chemes; whereas, in the con&s;titution of innocency, our fir&s;t parents could have no hope of this eternal life provided and pledged in the tree of life, but upon their forbearance to eat of the forbid|den fruit and fini&s;hed obedience: con&s;equently, upon tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, they were (this provi&s;ion and pledge notwith&s;tanding) forever cut off from all hope of eternal life by that con&s;titution; and were accordingly drove out of the garden of Eden, and a fla|ming &s;word placed to guard again&s;t all acce&s;s to the tree of life. So the con&s;titution of grace gives no hope to peri&s;hing &s;inners, but in compliance with the go&s;pel terms of life in this world: and tho&s;e who neglect the great &s;alvation, live and die in &s;in and im|penitency, are as effectually cut off all hope of &s;alvation, by this con&s;titution (the all-&s;ufficiency of the mediation and atonement of Chri&s;t notwith&s;tanding) as our fir&s;t parents were by tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|on under that con&s;titution. They cannot be &s;aved by this con|&s;titution of grace or any other, becau&s;e to them "there remains no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins." To &s;ay the condemned in the day of judgment, as workers of iniquity, are yet within the plan of mercy, and &s;hall finally be &s;aved, is to &s;et up an ab&s;urd oppo&s;i|tion between the plan of mercy and the revealed con&s;titution of mercy, in the nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential terms of it, as publi&s;hed to the world by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles. Which leads to another remark: The &s;ame objections lie again&s;t both &s;chemes, with this difference only; they are greater, &s;tronger, and &s;ome more again&s;t that of the univer&s;ali&s;ts. The impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to the finally di&s;obedient by go&s;pel con&s;titution&mdash; from the truth and immutability of God&mdash;the e&s;tabli&s;hed terms of life in it&mdash;the infallibility of the promi&s;es and threatnings&mdash;
<PB N="5" REF="019737_0024_0FACA2EA298614C8">
and from the character and government of God, &amp;c. is alike clear, as that after tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion our fir&s;t parents could never ob|tain eternal life by the con&s;titution of innocency. Surely the &s;tatutes and declarations that exclude them the kingdom of God and eternal life, and con&s;ign them to everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion, are in as clear, &s;trong, and preremtory terms as the fir&s;t threatning, and often repeated, and with this ob&s;ervable differ|ence; there was nothing in that con&s;titution to render it incon|&s;i&s;tent or impo&s;&s;ible, but that mankind (although forever cut off by that) might yet have eternal life through a mediator and atonement, by another, the con&s;titution of grace now e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. But this door of hope is &s;hut to the finally impenitent; ina&s;much as "Chri&s;t will profit them nothing", "and to them there is no more &s;acrifice for &s;in." And we have the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance we can have, that the word of this con&s;titution will not give place to another, but "abide in full force forever." Again, the &s;ame deluding artifice "a pretence of greater good and advantage" attends both &s;chemes, they di&s;play their advan|tages in &s;trong a&s;&s;ertions and colourings, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salvation for all men, p. 2.</NOTE> but with all their art and oratory, they cannot di&s;play them beyond that "ye &s;hall be as Gods, knowing good and evil," tran&s;cendently knowing and immortally happy. No doubt, the indulgence of pre&s;ent appetite, with the pro&s;pect of &s;o great an advance of happine&s;s, had great force "as the greater good" upon the deluded ima|gination of the woman, "when &s;he &s;aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes, and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, and took of the fruit thereof and did eat, &amp;c." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 3.6.</NOTE> and to a deluded imagination error is wont to ap|pear more &s;pecious and taking than the truth of God. But to pa&s;s this artifice without running the parallel of the two &s;chemes in it further, I proceed to a more important remark, viz. both doctrines have the &s;ame ruinous, mo&s;t fatal tendency. They tend to confound the nature of things&mdash;the great and e&s;&s;ential difference between virtue and vice, holine&s;s and &s;in; to annul the di&s;tinction of character between the righteous and the wicked, or render it &s;mall and unimportant in this world; to mi&s;repre&s;ent the character of God, and exclude all ju&s;t ideas of his moral government; and particularly of the great doctrine
<PB N="6" REF="019737_0025_0FACA426AC4D27F0">
of future rewards and puni&s;hments as taught by rea&s;on and the revelation of God. They tend entirely to defeat the de|&s;ign of his threatnings in this world, to re&s;train from wicked|ne&s;s, or to engage men to repentance and life. For if they &s;hall never be executed &s;o as to exclude them everla&s;ting life, where is the terror of them? where the energy of them in the hearts of men to &s;upport the law, authority and government of God over them? The doctrine in its direct tendency operates di&s;regard to the divine authority and laws&mdash;to the go&s;pel terms of life&mdash;and to all obedience in this pre&s;ent life; be|cau&s;e it is all unnece&s;&s;ary to their enjoyment of eternal life: This is as &s;ure to them, upon a foundation that cannot fail, be they ever &s;o wicked, as though ever &s;o holy and good; though not &s;o &s;oon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;cripture it is preremptorily declared, "he that believeth not &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;" "that the un|righteous, &amp;c. &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God:" now to &s;ay the&s;e unbelieving, unrighteous ones &s;hall &s;ee life and inherit the kingdom of God&mdash;that they are brought into the world expectants of a ble&s;&s;ed immor|tality upon a foundation that will not di&s;appoint them, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Salvation for all men, p. 26.</NOTE> is clearly to &s;et up a doctrine directly oppo&s;ite to that of &s;cripture, in import, nature, tendency and operation. This promi&s;&s;ary one, defeats the influence and effects of the threatning; it revives and &s;upports the hope to the di&s;obedient the threat|ning is de&s;igned to cut off: it encourages and imboldens to that unbelief and di&s;obedience the threatning is mo&s;t wi&s;ely de&s;igned and fitted to prevent. e. g. &s;uppo&s;e a parent indeavouring to reclaim a profligate &s;on, threatens him he will ab&s;olutely di&s;inherit him, and puni&s;h him with utmo&s;t &s;everity, if he doth not amend and become obedient in a limited time, &s;ay one year; but, while under this threat, in the cour&s;e of this di&s;cipline, let him know the inheritance was finally &s;ure to him, whether reclaimed or not, and let him be ever &s;o profligate during the whole term&mdash;he &s;hould indeed be pu|ni&s;hed with great &s;everity if he did not amend&mdash;but as to the inheritance, in all the riches, honours and plea&s;ures of it, it was &s;ure to him "upon a foundation which would not di&s;appoint him,"&mdash;what mu&s;t be the effect? The threatning of di&s;heri&s;on, e&s;pecially, would have no force: He would di&s;pi&s;e him for his weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency: and, if con&s;cience and mo|ral &s;en&s;e was in exerci&s;e, would abhor him for an attempt to rule and re|duce him by impo&s;ition and deceit. And &s;hall men impute &s;uch a &s;cheme of folly and abomination to the infinitely wi&s;e and holy God? That be far from us. Let them critici&s;e and turn as they will, we are &s;ure no &s;uch &s;elf-repugnant, incon&s;i&s;tent, &s;elf-de&s;troying doctrine can be found in di|vine revelation.

will be executed, &s;o &s;urely does it operate de&s;truction to tho&s;e who follow the natural dictates and tendency of it. To &s;ay this doctrine is capable of being perverted and abu&s;ed to &s;in as every other doctrine may, is to evade and di&s;gui&s;e the truth. It is the natural tendency and opperation of it, as is evident in the &s;eduction and di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t parents, involving the world of mankind in &s;in and condemnation: for how was that &s;eduction effected, but by a denial of the threatning, ac|companied with an a&s;&s;uring declaration, "they &s;hould be as Gods," tran&s;cendently and immortally happy, their di&s;obedi|ence in this &s;tate notwith&s;tanding. Was their &s;eduction then the abu&s;e of the devil's doctrine, or the natural effect of it, to which it was fitted, and which he de&s;igned? And if it was &s;o fatal to innocent minds, will it be le&s;s &s;o in minds that are dege|nerate? if the force of pre&s;umption be &s;o great already, that (without grounds, and again&s;t the de&s;ign of it) corrupt men will encourage them&s;elves in &s;in from the delay of puni&s;hment: "&s;o that becau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t their evil works is not exe|cuted &s;peedily, therefore the hearts of the &s;ons of men are fully &s;et in them to do evil," how much more will they be embol|dened and hardened in it when taught it never will be ex|ecuted to their final exclu&s;ion from eternal life. To aver their doctrine gives no encouragement to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e "they in&s;i&s;t a man will be mi&s;erable while he is wicked, and that he mu&s;t be virtuous in order to be happy," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divine Glory in the Salvation of all Men, p. 15.</NOTE> avails not, while they maintain with it that let them live and die ever &s;o wic|ked, yet they &s;hall all &s;urely turn from their wickedne&s;s, become virtuous, and enjoy everla&s;ting life in &s;ome future period. In this connexion it operates no effectual re&s;traint, no good to men in this world, but lulls them in &s;ecurity in &s;in. It operates no hurt to the &s;cheme and kingdom of the wicked one: it is of no con&s;equence to him how much the doctrine in this connex|ion is taught and believed, only as it &s;erves the more to delude and harden men; for if he can but hold them in &s;in and impe|nitency to death and the day of judgment, his malicious de&s;ign is accompli&s;hed. Let this a&s;&s;ertion be placed in its connexi|on with this life, where it ought to &s;tand&mdash;that men mu&s;t cea&s;e

to be wicked, turn to God, and be holy in this world, or they cannot be &s;aved and be happy," it is the truth of God, and it will have weight and influence in proportion to the firmne&s;s with which it is realizingly believed.

Here there is &s;uch a parity, that to exalt our apprehen&s;ions of the fullne&s;s and freene&s;s of this mercy, and to incourage our duty in &s;eeking it, there is the greate&s;t propriety and force in our Saviour's addre&s;s to the&s;e tender feelings. "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him? <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke 11.13.</NOTE> But we cannot in the lea&s;t infer, from all the infinite riches of his grace exhibited in this di&s;pen&s;ation, that

he will &s;hew any favor "to the ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted for de|&s;truction" when he &s;its on the throne of judgment, to render righteous retribution to them; for he hath told us expre&s;sly "if his hand take hold on judgment, he will render vengeance to his enemies, and reward them that hate him" and repeatedly, "that his eye &s;hall not &s;pare, nor will he have pity." Mercy is &s;et a&s;ide and precluded exerci&s;e to them, and ju&s;tice will have its cour&s;e. Humane, &s;ocial affections are implanted in us, to &s;timulate us to &s;ocial duties, and for the good of &s;ociety in this world. Parental affections are to &s;timulate us to parental duty, to pre&s;erve, cheri&s;h, feed, cloath, provide for and bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. But the power of their life and death are not put into our hands. There|fore to de&s;troy them without cau&s;e, without right as propo&s;ed in the que&s;tion: again&s;t the command of God, the force of con&s;cience, and all the indearing ties of parental and &s;ocial affections, and the grand intention of them, would be mo&s;t e|normous wickedne&s;s. No wonder, at the putting of the que&s;|tion, the heart recoils again&s;t it, with all it's force. But this concludes nothing, what God as moral governour and righteous judge may and will do, in final judgment. For it is to be no|ted, the&s;e &s;ocial and parental affections are not implanted in us as a rule and &s;tandard, by which to mea&s;ure out the ju&s;tice of God or man. So far from it, that in judging of righteou&s;ne&s;s between man and man, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide&mdash;and the bia&s;ing exerci&s;es of them, are expre&s;sly precluded and forbidden by the &s;tatutes of God. "Thou &s;halt not countenance a poor man in his cau&s;e."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 23.3.</NOTE> "Thou &s;halt not re&s;pect the per&s;on of the poor, nor honour the per&s;on of the mighty; but in righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;halt thou judge thy neighbour."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. 19.15.</NOTE> And Levi mu&s;t know neither father nor mother nor the deare&s;t connections in life, when pur&s;uing and executing righteous judgment.

Now, can it be right to &s;et up the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions (&s;o excluded as a rule in matters of ju&s;tice by the laws of God and man) to be the rule, mea&s;ure and &s;tandard whereby to judge of, to re|ceive or reject the infinitely wi&s;e maxims and rules of everla&s;ting

righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which God now governs the world, and will finally &s;ettle the &s;tates of all men? If this doth not fully con|vince and &s;atisfy, apply this rule to in&s;tances on &s;acred record, and &s;ee the re&s;ult. If Adam, the parent of mankind had lived to the time of Noah, and &s;een the wickedne&s;s of his nume|rous po&s;terity, and had it in his power; would he uncommi&s;&s;i|oned of God, have overwhelmed all the millions of his po&s;terity then exi&s;ting in a flood, except Noah and his family? Surely, he would not. Righteous Lot was vexed with the filthy con|ver&s;ation of the wicked Sodomites; if in his power, would he unauthori&s;ed by God, have burnt up the cities of Sodom and Ghomorrha and all the numerous inhabitants in them, and tur|ned his di&s;obedient wife into a pillar of &s;alt? By no means. Would Abraham, who plead with &s;uch inimitable interce&s;&s;i|ons for them, have executed &s;uch de&s;truction on them? In no wi&s;e. What is the conclu&s;ion by this rule? why, again&s;t the force of divine record, that the old world never was drowned by a flood, nor Sodom and Ghomorrha con&s;umed by fire from heaven, as is reported to us. It exceeds all belief, as it is in|congruous with the tender pa&s;&s;ions and feelings of human na|ture, which is &s;et up as the rule of judging of the divine di&s;pen|&s;ations, of what may or may not be done. God's mercies in|finitely exceed that of the&s;e good men, and therefore it mu&s;t be incredible that he &s;hould execute &s;uch de&s;truction, as they would not. So pernicious is this rule of judging; which is condemned and reprobated by millions of in&s;tances in the di|vine di&s;pen&s;ations in this world. And &s;uch an application to the pa&s;&s;ions is injudicious, and pernicious; it is condemned by the word and providence of God&mdash;by the rea&s;on of man, and the good policy of this world: and it &s;eems can &s;erve no pur|po&s;e, but to blind the mind and pervert the judgment in mat|ters of the greate&s;t moment, and in the end, to promote the cau&s;e of infidelity.</P>
<P>It is objected, that the doctrine of eternal puni&s;hment is in|credible, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the end of the creation, which is the happine&s;s of the creature&mdash;incon&s;i&s;tent with infi|nite benevolence and goodne&s;s, and infinitely good govern|ment.</P>
<P>Upon examination, we do not find any thing in &s;cripture or

rea&s;on&mdash;in the end of creation&mdash;the nature of things&mdash;the con&s;titution of moral &s;ubjects&mdash;nor in the character and go|vernment of God, again&s;t this &s;cripture doctrine; but much, very much to confirm the credibility of it. Scripture &s;aith. Thou ha&s;t created all things; and for thy plea&s;ure they are, and were created. Rev. 4.11. For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever, amen. Rom. 11.36. The Lord hath made all things for him&s;elf: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. Prov. 16.4. Which &s;peak not indi&s;criminate happine&s;s to all men, but the contrary.</P>
<P>It is obvious to rea&s;on, that the work of creation in all the wi&s;dom and glory of it, is a &s;ubordinate means to the moral government of God, as a higher end; and the natural and providential government of God, is al&s;o &s;ubordinate and &s;ub|&s;ervient to his moral government: and this &s;ub&s;ervient to the brighte&s;t di&s;play of the moral perfections and glory of the De|ity; and the highe&s;t &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of all his obedient, moral &s;ubjects, in an in&s;eparable connection, as the ultimate end of the whole. This directly militates again&s;t and &s;ubverts their notion, that the happine&s;s of the creature in their &s;en&s;e, is the ultimate end of creation. And from this view we infer, this &s;upreme and eternal government is, and will be &s;upported by the highe&s;t &s;anctions in nature, tho&s;e which are eternal. The&s;e being apparently the mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;uitable; and the&s;e only adequate, to the infinite importance of it.</P>
<P>It is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God, and his de&s;ign in creation, that his moral &s;ubjects &s;hould be placed in a &s;tate of dangerous trial; previous and preparatory to the en|joyment of the unutterable rewards of his eternal kingdom: and that they &s;hould be dealt with, rewarded or puni&s;hed, ac|cording to their obedience or di&s;obedience, in &s;uch &s;tate of trial. The con&s;titution of angels, as we learn from the apo&s;tacy and puni&s;hment of the fallen angels: the con&s;titution of mankind in innocency: and the con&s;titution of grace, &s;ub&s;equent to the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents&mdash;as facts, are inconte&s;tible proofs of it. But this, is totally incon&s;i&s;tent with their doctrine that the hap|pine&s;s of the creature univer&s;ally, and without di&s;tinction of character, is the ultimate end of creation and the divine govern|ment, as is likewi&s;e the death denounced in the fir&s;t threatning

&mdash;the calamities, death and de&s;truction, which hath come upon millions of mankind in their generations, and the future puni&s;h|ment, which they allow awaits the wicked in the invi&s;ible world. The&s;e inconte&s;tible facts do mo&s;t &s;trongly witne&s;s and evince, that the happine&s;s of the creature without di&s;tinction of chara|cter, is not the grand object pur&s;ued: for if it was, why &s;uch dangerous trial, and &s;uch tremendous puni&s;hment of &s;in, in this world and the future?&mdash;why &s;uch pointed di&s;pen&s;ations of de&s;truction to the wicked for ages of ages, directly oppo&s;ing and fru&s;trating the grand intention pur&s;ued, if the happine&s;s of the creature univer&s;ally, was the main object of creation and divine government? yea, why any &s;tate of trial appointed? why are not all on their creation immediately formed and con|firmed in a &s;tate of immutable and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and in this way the grand object be &s;ecured, if this be the ultimate end of creation? for what is the de&s;ign of a &s;tate of trial? or where is the wi&s;dom, fitne&s;s and goodne&s;s of it, but for the forming of characters&mdash;di&s;clo&s;ing the di&s;tinction of them, and thereby preparing moral &s;ubjects for a &s;tate of retribution: and to illu&s;trate the divine character and government in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible glory&mdash;both in the conducting the divine di&s;pen&s;ations to them in a &s;tate of trial, and in the meet recompences which will be rendered to them, according to the good or evil of them, in an eternal &s;tate. But if indi&s;criminate, univer&s;al happine&s;s to all, in a final &s;tate of retribution, (whatever be their conduct and characters formed in a &s;tate of trial) be the grand object, it is all rendered vain; which is impo&s;&s;ible. Wherefore, the&s;e divine con&s;titutions of trial, in their nature and grand intenti|on, and the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;pen&s;ations of God, pur&s;uant to them, in the recompences we know he hath rendered to the obedient and di&s;obedient, are as facts, inconte&s;tible proofs, that the doc|trine of the indi&s;criminate, univer&s;al happine&s;s of all, is not the object and end of creation, and the divine di&s;pen&s;ations: but the moral government of God in it's infinitely important con|nexions fore-mentioned.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is certainly con&s;i&s;tent with infinite benevolence and good government, that &s;in and mi&s;ery &s;hould exi&s;t in the dominions of God for ages of ages: for it is an indi&s;putable fact, that &s;in and mi&s;ery hath already exi&s;ted in &s;ubjects pa&s;t an|numeration

Therefore, their doctrine of indi&s;criminate happine&s;s to all, as the end of creation and di|vine government, &s;tands condemned by facts open to all the world, to all the univer&s;e, in the&s;e atte&s;tations from God, "that verily there is a reward for the righteous, but a &s;trange puni&s;h|ment to the workers of iniquity." And from the &s;ame facts it is very evident, that in the nature of things, it is not incon|&s;i&s;tent with infinite benevolence and perfect government, that in the finally di&s;obedient, &s;in and mi&s;ery &s;hould remain and be perpetuated to all eternity. For God may righteou&s;ly puni&s;h &s;in with &s;in in them: the &s;in of ob&s;tinacy with a final derelicti|on, and giving up to hardne&s;s and utter de&s;truction, as he hath &s;ometimes done to &s;inners in this world; of which Pharoah and others are in&s;tances. And for what they or we know, the wi&s;e ends of his government may render it in the highe&s;t degree ne|ce&s;&s;ary and important. And that ideal goodne&s;s which &s;up|po&s;es it incon&s;i&s;tent, is evinced, by plain facts, to be un&s;crip|tural and fal&s;e. There is no di&s;puting again&s;t facts which &s;peak in a language unequivocal and deci&s;ive. And to attempt to &s;upport their vi&s;ionary theory, again&s;t &s;uch plain, immoveable, inconte&s;tible facts, by arguments a priori or any others, is utter|ly vain and as ab&s;urd as it would be for a man to attempt to demoli&s;h a brazen wall of a thou&s;and feet thickne&s;s with the breath of his mouth or the throw of a feather again&s;t it. The objection &s;eems fully overthrown by what hath been adduced, and might be more &s;o, by &s;hewing the ab&s;urd and pernicious con&s;equences which would follow, which I wave as needle&s;s.

<P>Doth the Mo&s;t High God &s;et up his moral government and kingdom to be the end and glory of creation, and all his works to be a monument of prai&s;e to him throughout the univer&s;e and to eternity? Rea&s;on dictates the motives and &s;anctions to &s;up|port it; and to &s;ecure the &s;ubjection, obedience and happine&s;s

of his &s;ubjects, will be &s;uitable to his immen&s;e wi&s;dom and ma|je&s;ty &mdash;to his infinite authority&mdash;and to &s;o great and eternal a de&s;ign. Con&s;equently, the good of obedience will infinitely &s;urpa&s;s what with truth and rea&s;on can be &s;ugge&s;ted to induce a revolt: And the evil and terror of di&s;obedience, be &s;uch as his creatures cannot avoid; and &s;hall infinitely exceed what the power of creatures can inflict or threaten with, to turn them a&s;ide. So that unerring truth and rea&s;on &s;hould dictate "the rule of our duty and happine&s;s, under this infinitely good government, is one and the &s;ame;" having infinitely more to hope or fear from God, as obedient or di&s;obedient, than all creation, and all that creatures can do. Now &s;uch, preci&s;ely, are the motives and &s;anctions, promi&s;es and threatnings, rewards and puni&s;hments held forth in the revelations of God. And our duty urged upon this ground; "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10, 31.</NOTE> The terror and evil of it infinitely exceeds that of all which creatures can do. So in that addre&s;s of the infinitely benevolent Saviour, to &s;ecure the fide|lity of chri&s;tians in the mo&s;t fiery trials and terrible per&s;ecuti|ons, "and I &s;ay unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do." Here is the utmo&s;t of creature power; but our Saviour arms us with a fear infinitely beyond it; adding, "but I will forewarn you whom you &s;hall fear; fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke, 12.4, 5.</NOTE> As Matthew ex|pre&s;&s;es it, "is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell." "I &s;ay unto you, fear him." Which words a&s;certain the de|&s;truction of apo&s;tates, &s;oul and body, in hell; or our Lord would not have threatened it: he was infinitely above dealing in vain, &s;uper&s;titious terrors. If we con&s;ult the nature of things, we find virtue and vice, holine&s;s and &s;in, are e&s;&s;entially and eternally different: the one, the object of divine compla|cency and rewarding goodne&s;s; the other an object of infinite abhorrence to the holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of God, and of his vin|dictive wrath. And why may not the one as well as the other, be eternally illu&s;trated accordingly, in the final retribution of an infinitely good and righteous God? Yea, why is it not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a government ab&s;olutely perfect? Further, rewards
<PB N="17" REF="019737_0036_0FACA42EF1CBFC60">
and puni&s;hments have their rea&s;on and foundation in this e&s;|&s;ential and eternal difference in the nature of things, and in the nature, wi&s;dom and end of government. On the &s;ame foundation, characters formed by virtue or vice, holine&s;s or &s;in, intitle to rewards, or &s;ubject to puni&s;hment. And it is e&s;&s;ential to a righteous, perfect government, that all the &s;ub|jects of it be dealt with according to their character and works. Now, if vicious crimes and characters doth &s;ubject to puni&s;h|ment, it mu&s;t be according to the demerit of crimes and exi&s;t|ence of &s;uch character which doth &s;ubject to it. Con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;e the righteous and the wicked to exi&s;t with unchanged characters to eternity, the wickedne&s;s of the wicked unatoned, the offered atonement rejected, and they remain impenitent; then it &s;eems the rewards of the one and puni&s;hment of the other, rendered on the ground of character and demerit, mu&s;t both be eternal: in their own words "they mu&s;t remain mi&s;e|rable as long as they remain &s;inful; not only becau&s;e "they are incapable of reli&s;hing rational happine&s;s," as they alledge, but al&s;o on higher grounds, from the nature of things they remain perpetually the &s;ame objects of indignation to the holi|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice of God; and by the force of a righteous &s;en|tence, inforced by the eternal operation of an infinitely wi&s;e, holy, righteous and good government, in way of retribution. This evinces there is no incredibility in our doctrine, in the na|ture of things, or which attends the nature of the &s;ubject. For if they may ju&s;tly remain mi&s;erable, and mu&s;t do &s;o as long as they remain &s;inful, as they admit, God's grace is his own and he may deny it to them forever; and then, (by their own con|ce&s;&s;ion) they may righteou&s;ly &s;uffer to eternity.</P>
<P>When we advert to the con&s;titution of the moral &s;ubjects of God's kingdom, the &s;cripture doctrine of eternal retributi|on &s;tands manife&s;t to rea&s;on. Our great Creator and &s;upreme Governor, has framed us to be governed by moral laws and rational motives. This will not be denied. He hath im|planted in our nature an inextingui&s;hable and immortal de&s;ire of life and good: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;pirit of in&s;piration addre&s;&s;es to this pa&s;&s;ion, P&s;alm 34, 12.</NOTE> the main-&s;pring by which motives have their operation and influence. He hath implanted in us the pa&s;&s;ions of hope and fear, which are among the mo&s;t powerful &s;prings in rational minds; and are chiefly de&s;igned to &s;ub&s;erve
<PB N="18" REF="019737_0037_0FACA42FABAEC128">
the great de&s;igns of his everla&s;ting kingdom. Surely it is highly rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that in a &s;tate of trial, he would ad|dre&s;s to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t motives in na|ture (eternal life and eternal death) to wind up and inforce the&s;e &s;prings of action, with &s;tronge&s;t energy. The&s;e motives appear the mo&s;t wi&s;e, &s;uitable and energetic for the &s;upport and glory of his government, and to &s;ecure the everla&s;ting holine&s;s and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects. On the other hand, it is very irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, an addre&s;s of motives to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o very unequal as to have no proportion the one to the other, that our hopes be animated with the pro&s;pect and reward of eternal life to the obedient, and our fears awakened only by a temporary puni&s;hment to the mo&s;t rebellious and profligate; and then hu&s;hed and lulled with a&s;&s;urance (after this puni&s;h|ment) of the enjoyment of eternal life. There is not the lea&s;t appearance of wi&s;dom in &s;uch an application. It is alike, but more ab&s;urd than it would be in an army to indulge a centinel to drow&s;e on guard, when occupying a mo&s;t important po&s;t, and in his failure, an army, a kingdom may be lo&s;t. Again, By nature and con&s;titution our &s;ouls are immortal, capable of never-ending happine&s;s or mi&s;ery: and revelation teaches us, that at the re&s;urrection, our bodies will be rai&s;ed and fitted to a &s;tate of immortality. It &s;eems very rational, that the mo|tives and &s;anctions of the divine government, &s;hould corre&s;pond to the immortal nature given us, and pro&s;pect before us: that they &s;hould be of &s;uch weight, moment and duration, as to be infinitely intere&s;ting to us, and determine our happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery throughout our endle&s;s exi&s;tence, as regarded or di&s;re|garded by us. If &s;uch be our natures, and we are to be go|verned by motives, why are not the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t in nature, tho&s;e which are eternal and mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ting to us throughout our immortal exi&s;tence, the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t? Are not the high and awful &s;anctions of eternal rewards and puni&s;hments, in the nature of things, be&s;t fitted to &s;upport the authority and government of God&mdash;to &s;ecure the innocence, obedience, and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and under a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy to inforce and induce com|pliance with the terms of life? It &s;eems too plain to admit di&s;pute. Why then &s;hould the doctrine be thought incredi|ble?

It is boldly a&s;&s;erted, it exceeds all belief&mdash;but of this we find no proof.

Divine ju&s;tice is a perfection as e&s;&s;ential in the divine nature and character as goodne&s;s it&s;elf; and the exerci&s;e and operation of it in govern|ment alike nece&s;&s;ary.

of wrath, &amp;c." are no more the objects of mercy in a &s;tate of retribution, than the objects of mercy, "ve&s;&s;els of mercy," are, at the &s;ame time, objects of punitive ju&s;tice. There is there|fore, no incredibility in the &s;cripture doctrine of the future pu|ni&s;hment, in the nature of things, or deducible from the cha|racter and perfections of God. That ideal goodne&s;s, which &s;uppo&s;es a difficulty and interference, is fal&s;e, imaginary, irra|tional and un&s;criptural, and belongs not, in truth, to God. The &s;ame revelation which teacheth us "he is the rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him," a&s;&s;ures us as peremptorily, "that to him vengeance belongeth, and that he will repay it to the di&s;obedient."</P>
<P>This &s;cripture doctrine, coincides and agrees intirely with our be&s;t conceptions of a wi&s;e, good and perfect government. In the 13th chapter to the Romans, Paul &s;ugge&s;ts to us the true idea of good government, as "ordained for good, to be a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them who do well:" not to give equal and undi&s;tingui&s;hed happine&s;s to all, good and bad; which is directly contrary to the idea of good government &s;ug|ge&s;ted by him. Can we conceive a government infinitely good upon this apo&s;tolick plan, without infinite &s;ecurity and protection, accompanied with eternal rewards to them who do well? and eternal terror and puni&s;hment to the irreconcilable enemies of it? The goodne&s;s of government (con&s;titutionally con&s;idered) very much con&s;i&s;ts in the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and excellency of its laws and in&s;titutions, in an in&s;eparable con|nection with the wi&s;dom and weight of its &s;anctions. In the &s;upreme government of God, in all other re&s;pects infinite in goodne&s;s, we rationally look for the mo&s;t weighty and &s;trong|e&s;t &s;anctions in nature, as be&s;t adapted for the greate&s;t good of government and the &s;ubjects of it. In proportion to the wi&s;|dom and weight of the &s;anctions, is the goodne&s;s of govern|ment. Wherefore eternal &s;anctions are &s;o far from militating again&s;t the goodne&s;s of the divine government, that they are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to render it perfect in goodne&s;s, and are clear illu&s;trati|ons of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Laws are e&s;&s;ential to government, and &s;anctions e&s;&s;en|tial to laws; without which they are not cloathed with the na|ture, nor ve&s;ted with the energy of laws; but &s;ink down into
<PB N="21" REF="019737_0040_0FACA431E4D3C3D0" MS="y">
&s;imple rules of right and wrong. And rea&s;on dictates that the &s;anctions &s;hould be proportionate to the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and importance of the laws and government. Con&s;equently, in the government of the Mo&s;t High, infinitely perfect and eternally important, where the honour of the Great King Eter|nal, and the highe&s;t intere&s;ts of innumerable millions of &s;ubjects to eternity are concerned and to be &s;ecured, the &s;anctions mu&s;t be the highe&s;t and mo&s;t energetick in nature: "eternal life and eternal death." This doctrine is &s;o intere&s;ting, that we can have no conception of a government infinitely good and per|fect, without it. We can have no idea of &s;uch a government without retribution; nor without a full, final di&s;play of ever|la&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> (remunerative or punitive, or both, accord|ing to the fixed character and works of the immortal &s;ubjects of it) in a &s;tate of retribution: it being a fir&s;t dictate of rea|&s;on, that the throne and kingdom of God will be upheld with everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s. Neither can we have conception of &s;uch a government, where the highe&s;t and &s;trong|e&s;t motives and &s;anctions in nature are not employed in it. It is in the&s;e we &s;ee and read the infinite wi&s;dom, care and bene|volence of God to his &s;ubjects, employing the &s;tronge&s;t mo|tives in nature to effect and &s;ecure their &s;ubjection, obedience and life, while he addre&s;&s;eth us with eternal life and eternal death, and that with an amazing Pathos&mdash;"turn and live; turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?" But where could we &s;ee his wi&s;dom and care for the honour of his immen&s;e maje&s;ty and authority, the dignity of his government, and glory of his everla&s;ting kingdom, if un&s;upported with &s;anctions, the high|e&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t energetick in nature i.e. eternal? Nor is &s;uch a perfect government conceivable, where provi&s;ion is not made in the con&s;titution of it, for the eternal exclu&s;ion and exci&s;ion of all the incurable and implacable enemies and &s;ub|verters of it. That government mu&s;t be very weak in wi&s;|dom, &s;ecurity and energy, where no &s;uch provi&s;ion and power is found. To attribute it to the &s;upreme government of the univer&s;e, is highly di&s;honourable; it is to degrade and &s;ink it in wi&s;dom, dignity and power below the little &s;tates and king|doms of this world, where &s;uch provi&s;ion and power is found, and is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ecurity and welfare. And

if there be no &s;anctions, threatnings and &s;tatutes in the divine government, by the force of which all the wicked, implacable enemies of it will be forever cut off and con&s;igned to &s;uch an everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, as to lay them under a di&s;ability and impo&s;&s;ibility of ever injuring or di&s;turbing the kingdom of God and the good &s;ubjects of it; then, it &s;eems, in the nature of things, as they are by nature immortal, they may continue eternally the di&s;turbers of it, and there is no remedy of govern|ment again&s;t &s;uch everla&s;ting evils.

St. Paul &s;ug|ge&s;ts, that in the puni&s;hment of the wicked, "their everla&s;ting de&s;truction," "they can trouble no more:" and &s;ugge&s;ts it as one thing which illu&s;trates the righteou&s;ne&s;s of it. 2 The&s;. 1. 6, 7, 8, 9 ver. in their connection.</P>

For in that way, the very rule of judgment, that every man &s;hall re|ceive according to the deeds done in the body, is de&s;troyed&mdash; the award to the wicked is not according to their de&s;erts, as held forth in the &s;tatutes and threatnings&mdash;the fulfilment doth not corre&s;pond with the declarations&mdash;and the puni&s;h|ment cannot an&s;wer the great ends of government de&s;igned.

He hath declared this provi|&s;ion in the con&s;titution of it, for the final exci&s;ion of all the ob|&s;tinate enemies of it. He hath announced the &s;tatutes by which they &s;hall not enter and inherit his eternal kingdom; and his threatnings which con&s;ign them to the everla&s;ting fire and puni&s;hment prepared for the devil and his angels. And he hath a&s;&s;ured us, that this dreadful puni&s;hment &s;hall be fully executed upon them in all it's terrors&mdash;"that the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in his judgment"&mdash;"that the wicked &s;hall pe|ri&s;h, &s;hall be de&s;troyed forever"&mdash;"that their end is de&s;truc|tion" &mdash;"their end is to be burned"&mdash;"that they &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, everla&s;ting de&s;truction from his pre&s;ence&mdash;&s;hall &s;ink as a mill&s;tone into the &s;ea to ri&s;e no more, and &s;hall be tormented day and night forever and ever." He hath taught us clearly, that he will not &s;ettle the &s;tates of his &s;ubjects for eternity in the way of ab&s;olute &s;overeignty, ei|ther by an act of univer&s;al grace, a&s;&s;igning all to happine&s;s, or by an arbitrary puni&s;hing any of his &s;ubjects, right or wrong, or beyond their de&s;erts; but the puni&s;hment will be accord|ing to the demerit and wages of &s;in: and as righteous moral governor he will &s;ettle the &s;tates of all his &s;ubjects by the laws and rules of his kingdom, in the way of retribution of rewards and puni&s;hments. He exhibits the preparations already made which doth in&s;ure the full execution of this great de&s;ign of fi|nal retribution to all men, according to their character and works in this life. For the great day of judgment is appoint|ed to &s;ettle the great affairs of God's kingdom, and the States of all his moral &s;ubjects, in a governmental, judicial way, for eternity.

the invi&s;ible and eternal world, to &s;ettle the &s;tates of all in this and that world finally and for eternity: it is put in &s;ubjection to him for the great purpo&s;e of compleating the &s;alvation of all his people, and the effectual &s;ubdual of his and their enemies. And in the execution of this great tru&s;t, all enemies will in fact be mo&s;t effectually put down under his feet, by an everla&s;ting &s;entence, judgment and execution. And of this we are now notified to inforce the admonition, to take heed to the go&s;pel in this pre&s;ent life as our only &s;ea&s;on of &s;alvation, and warn us there is no po&s;&s;ible e&s;cape to the neglectors of &s;o great &s;alvation. Heb. 2.1 to the 9th. He proceeds in fol|lowing ver&s;es to &s;hew we now &s;ee him accompli&s;hing his fir&s;t work as a Saviour; by the grace of God opening a door of &s;al|vation to all men upon the &s;ame terms, by ta&s;ting death for every man, and by &s;acrifice taking an effectual method to bring many &s;ons unto glory, even all who believe and obey him: and when he hath compleated his work as a Saviour, he will as &s;urely compleat his work as a judge, in the final de&s;truction of his enemies. This la&s;t point, is a point of &s;uch great impor|tance to the kingdom of God, and to illu&s;trate the power and glory of Chri&s;t in highe&s;t glory, and for the good of mankind, &amp;c. that it is brought up to view again and again on different occa&s;ions: "For we &s;hall all (friends and enemies) &s;tand be|fore the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t: for it is written, as I live, &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God: &s;o then every one of us &s;hall give account of him&s;elf to God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 14. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> Again, "Wherefore God al&s;o hath high|ly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at or in the name (authority and power) of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord (as rightful lawgiver, who hath given the righteous rule of judgment to the world, and righteous judge who renders in &s;entence and execution righte|ous retribution to all) to the glory of the Father" who hath ordained him to this infinitely important office and tru&s;t.
<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;ali&s;ts under&s;tand this &s;ubdual and &s;ubjection of all enemies to be in them "pious and voluntary;" and that Chri&s;t will de&s;troy both fir&s;t and &s;econd death: con&s;equently the final "putting them all down under foot," mu&s;t be (contrary to the natural &s;trong import of the phra&s;e) the &s;aving and exalting them all to favour and happine&s;s. Their rea&s;ons for this con&s;truction we are yet to &s;eek. Surely it cannot be from the u&s;e and force of the original word, &s;ubject; for it is u&s;ed for all and every kind of regular, orderly, governmental &s;ubjection, whether pious or not, by con|&s;traint or willingly. It is u&s;ed for the orderly &s;ubjection of inferiors to &s;uperiors, in the whole circle of this relative duty, in this world; as of &s;ubjects to kings, governors and civil rulers&mdash;of wives to hu&s;bands&mdash;of hearers to the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t&mdash;children to parents, and &s;ervants to ma&s;|ters; as may be &s;een by con&s;ulting the original texts. No one will avow this &s;ubjection is always pious. True, they are bound to be obedient in the Lord, with a pious regard to God: but whether thus obedient or not, they are bound to this orderly &s;ubjection; and God has appointed puni&s;hments in this world to the rebellious. The civil magi&s;trate doth not wear the &s;word in vain, nor have parents and ma&s;ters their authority in vain, where|with to cha&s;ti&s;e the di&s;obedient. And beyond doubt the verb is &s;ome|times u&s;ed for a mo&s;t unwilling and con&s;trained &s;ubjection; as when the devils are &s;aid to be &s;ubject to Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples. The &s;eventy re|turn from their mi&s;&s;ion and make report with joy, "Lord, even the devils are &s;ubject to us through thy name." Luke 10.17. Can any one imagine the devils were then converted into good beings, and this was a pious cor|dial &s;ubjection? If &s;o, why doth our Lord tell them, v. 20, "Notwith|&s;tanding in this rejoice not, that the &s;pirits are &s;ubject unto you, but ra|ther that your names are written in heaven." In the regulation of go|ment, the word &s;ubject is put for an authoritative, ordained, appointed &s;ubjection; and the execution, which is the legal effect and re&s;ult of &s;uch &s;ubjection, effected upon &s;ubjects, is their &s;ubdual and &s;ubjection, whether voluntary or by con&s;traint. Thus all criminals are by authorative ap|pointment, put in &s;ubjection to the con&s;tituted judge or judges of every government: and when traitors and enemies are arrained, convicted, con|demned and executed by the authority of &s;uch judges, the&s;e criminals are then &s;ubdued, &s;ubjected to him who &s;ubjected them. They are effectually &s;ubjected and put down under foot to the authority of law and government. And this appears the plain meaning of the text. Chri&s;t is &s;upreme Lord of all things, and the ordained judge of all the moral &s;ubjects of Jehovah, through all his dominions; and by a divine ordination and appointment now made, all the irreconcilable enemies of this great kingdom are put under him, his deci&s;ion and di&s;po&s;al, to be &s;ubdued, &s;ubjected and put un|der his feet&mdash;(of which the world are now notified by the predictions he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> referred to, by the declarations of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and particular|ly in this text) and when, by righteous &s;entence and execution in the great day, his enemies are all con&s;igned to their de&s;erved puni&s;hment, then will they be all &s;ubdued, &s;ubjected, and put down under his foot. And the in|&s;truction given in this and the forcited texts is, that the authority, laws, and government of God, will finally be mo&s;t compleatly e&s;tabli&s;hed over all: all mu&s;t bow in a willing &s;ubjection to it in their &s;tate of trial, or bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a &s;ubjection and &s;ubdual to and under it in a &s;tate of righteous puni&s;h|ment. Nor can they infer their &s;en&s;e of &s;ubjection, becau&s;e "the &s;on him|&s;elf will then be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him." This &s;ub|jection will no doubt be in the highe&s;t degree "voluntary:" but it is not the thing here intended: For in this &s;en&s;e he was alway &s;ubject to his fa|ther, always doing the will "and things that plea&s;ed him." The apo&s;|tle points us to a &s;ubjection of a different kind, then new, which never before exi&s;ted, but would remain to eternity, when God, the adorable trinity, would be "all in all." Nece&s;&s;ity obliges us to under&s;tand this &s;ubjection to be by way of external regulation, order and arrangement, in re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of the great kingdom of Jehovah: and in|&s;tead of weakening, it greatly &s;trengthens the &s;en&s;e of &s;ubjection before no|ted of the enemies. And our con&s;truction &s;eems confirmed beyond doubt, when it is con&s;idered that the whole paragraph relates intirely to an ex|ternal regulation and arrangement in the divine admini&s;tration, and not to any new acts of grace to be given or works to be done, for bringing in &s;ubjects into the kingdom of God. The characters of friends, that they are Chri&s;t's by pious &s;ubjection in this world, and characters of enemies are fixed for judgment. In that day, they that are Chri&s;t's &s;hall have a glorious re&s;urrection to an immortal, everla&s;ting life; this is the main &s;ub|ject. Then, (at that grand period) &s;ays Paul, cometh the end&mdash;of what? of this world and the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of the kingdom of God&mdash;it will give place to an entire new regulation and arrangement; for Chri&s;t "&s;hall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father." But mi&s;take not, it will not be, till he hath compleated his awful work upon his and his people's enemies: for they are already, by divine ordination and appointment, put in &s;ubjection to him; &s;ome, to be totally de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t to be put under his feet. All inimical rule, authority and power &s;hall be put down and de&s;troyed, and the la&s;t enemy of his people, which &s;hall totally be de|&s;troyed, is natural death. The re&s;t, the moral enemies, &s;hall be &s;ubdued, &s;ubjected and put under his feet, by righteous &s;entence and execution, in a &s;tate of de&s;erved puni&s;hment. This our opponants allow will be done in the day of judgment; and we read of but this one &s;ubdual and putting down all enemies under his feet; none other is intimated in the text or in the revelations of God. Then, When "he hath &s;ubdued them unto him," having compleated his work as Judge, and turned the key of the invi&s;ible world, he hath in his hand, upon them: he will deliver it and the kingdom to God the Father&mdash;which will be followed with two new and grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ments &mdash;the Son him&s;elf &s;ubject&mdash;and God all in ALL&mdash;in admini&s;tration, to eternity. Their con&s;truction of the word, "to internal pious di&s;po&s;ition of the enemies" being plainly again&s;t the whole &s;cope of the paragraph, and the u&s;e of the word in every other part of it, can by no means be ad|mitted. And this paragraph doth in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive manner de&s;troy their &s;cheme, by evincing the impo&s;&s;ibility that their re&s;toration &s;hould ever take place after the day of judgment: becau&s;e the Saviour will then put off his character of Saviour and Judge, and give up the kingdom. To &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;econd death is one of the enemies of mankind he is appointed to de|&s;troy, and if he doth not do it, before the delivering up of the kingdom, he hath not compleated his work; appears one of the mo&s;t wild imaginations that ever troubled the head of any man. The &s;econd death is the righteous puni&s;hment, which God hath prepared and appointed for the enemies of mankind and his kingdom. He hath ordained Chri&s;t as his Judge to con|&s;ign them to it. In this, con&s;i&s;ts Chri&s;t'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> compleat victory and eternal triumph over the old &s;erpent and all his malignant&s;feed.

Wherefore, to &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;t will not inflict this puni&s;hment, before he puts off the character of Judge, is in truth to &s;uppo&s;e he puts off the character, before he hath done his work: or, to &s;uppo&s;e him to de&s;troy it, after it is inflicted, is to &s;uppo&s;e him to give up his own victory and triumph to his enemies, than which what more extravagant? and the epithets poor and low, given to the common con&s;truction, recoils back in full force, upon their own.</NOTE>

All things &s;poken of by the Prophets as preceeding this time, being accompli&s;hed, he will then make a full and final regulation, not only of &s;ome, but of All things at and in his Coming. Now, we know he will per&s;onally come a &s;econd time at the end of the world, in the Great day of the re&s;urrection and final judgment. We have it from our Saviour, 25 Mat. and other places&mdash;from Paul and John and all the apo&s;tles. He will actually then, regulate all things in the great moral kingdom in way of retribution&mdash;deciding and &s;ettling the &s;tates of all, good and bad&mdash;by puni&s;hing the wicked and rewarding the righteous. The text a&s;certains, this is the time of the regulation of all things: "for the heavens mu&s;t receive and retain him till that time." The heavens now reveal him&mdash;and this is the time of this Great re&s;titution and regulation. And having &s;ub|dued and regulated all things, as &s;hewn in the foregoing note "he will give up the kingdom." This text doth then deci&s;ively de&s;troy the notion that there will be any re&s;titution, after the final judgment. That, being the time pointed out in this text for the regulation of all things, and Chri&s;t having in fact regulated ALL THINGS: it is &s;elf-evident there can be nothing more to regu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e.

This is mo&s;t emphatically the time of the regulation of all things, by an eternal arrangement of all things in the moral kingdom of God, in mo&s;t excellent order and infinite perfection. All the darkne&s;s, di&s;orders, irregularities, perplexities and my&s;teries which clouded the divine di&s;pen&s;ati|ons in this world, vani&s;h before the light which breaks forth in that day: "And ju&s;tice and judgment," are &s;een through the univer&s;e, "to be the habitation of God's throne;" in &s;in de|&s;ervedly puni&s;hed&mdash;holine&s;s eternally rewarded&mdash;every moral &s;ubject rewarded or puni&s;hed according to character and work, in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s: This righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o clear and deeply impre&s;&s;ive, that every mouth is &s;topped, and every tongue mu&s;t confe&s;s to God, to Chri&s;t the judge&mdash;"the re|proaches of the ungodly forever &s;ilenced&mdash;all enemies eternal|ly put down, that they who have troubled can trouble no more"&mdash;all the faithful &s;ervants and children of God, exalted

In a word; that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked, and vice ver&s;a, the friends and enemies of government &s;hould fare alike, and be alike happy or mi&s;erable, in a &s;tate of final retribution, is mo&s;t abhorrent and contrary to righteous and good government; and much more to one infinitely perfect. It is fundamentally &s;ubver&s;ive of natural and revealed religion, and of all good go|vernment of God or man; by a total de&s;truction of the great principles and motives of piety and obedience. It is the very thing reprobated in the patriarch's plea, in a di&s;pen&s;ation of divine retribution in this world, as incompatible with the cha|racter of the righteous judge of the world. Gen. 18.25. "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to &s;lay the righteous with the wicked; and that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked, that be far from thee: &s;hall not the judge of all the earth do right?" In the common cour&s;e of Providence, where characters are forming for judgment and retribution, it is very con&s;i&s;tent "that one event &s;hould happen to the righ|teous and wicked;" but in this in&s;tance, God was about to &s;ettle accounts with the inhabitants of Sodom and Ghomor|rha, finally for this world, and execution immediately to fol|low the judgment in way of retribution, according to their cha|racter and works. On this turns the propriety and force of this plea: and on this ground father Abraham urges, "that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked," is incompatible with the character of the righteous judge of the world, and righteous judgment. The plea is good, the &s;entiment altogether ju&s;t and true. God an&s;wers the prayer, and confirms it to be &s;o, in the retribution given. The guilty inhabitants of Sodom and Ghomorrha are forthwith de&s;troyed, but righteous Lot and family are &s;aved, And hereby God de&s;ignedly gives clear in&s;truction, and mo&s;t forcible warning to the world, by way of example,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jude 7th.</NOTE> that in the final retribution he will a&s;&s;ured|ly make an open, vi&s;ible, everla&s;ting di&s;tinction and difference between "the righteous and the wicked," "him that &s;erveth

<P>God's kingdom is everla&s;ting; will &s;tand and endure forever and ever: Surely the motives and &s;anctions, to induce the &s;ubjects who&s;e exi&s;tence will be commen&s;urate to the duration of it, to &s;ubjection and compliance with the terms of life, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be eternal. Temporary rewards, or temporary pu|ni&s;hments only, however great, are evidently altogether incon|gruous in nature&mdash;unequal in dignity and importance, and in|adequate in energy to &s;uch a kingdom and va&s;t de&s;ign. Rea|&s;on dictates they are no more adequate to the &s;upport of &s;uch a kingdom, than family di&s;cipline is to the &s;upport of the great|e&s;t empires of this world. If they be not eternal, where is the energy of his adorable government to be found? where his in|finite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to be &s;een, in adapting and propor|tioning the means to the end? Sin, beyond doubt, is the great|e&s;t evil in the univer&s;e, and that alone which introduceth all the di&s;order, calamity and mi&s;ery that ever was, now is, and ever will be found in it. It is highly rational to believe, that the infinitely wi&s;e God and Governor, in conducting an infi|nitely good and perfect government, will give his &s;ubjects clear and deci&s;ive in&s;tructions of the danger, ill de&s;ert, and fa|tal con&s;equences of &s;in, to warn and guard them again&s;t it; and to &s;ecure their &s;ubjection and life. And this dictate of rea&s;on is fully confirmed by fact: For this was one of the fir&s;t and cleare&s;t in&s;tructions given to man in innocency: "In the day thou eare&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die:" clearly teaching the ill demerit and penalty of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to be an "eternal ex|clu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. And what in&s;tructions of the evil of &s;in can be more clear and deci&s;ive than tho&s;e given in revelation? where the wages of &s;in are denounced to be "death," contra&s;ted with eternal life&mdash;where the puni&s;hment of it is &s;et forth in &s;tronge&s;t language, in way of threatning, and by de&s;cription, literal and figurative, and by exemplifica|tion, to be eternal. How unrea&s;onable it is then to &s;ay, the doctrine is incredible, when clear and deci&s;ive in&s;truction and admonition of the evil and fatal con&s;equences of it, is the very thing which rea&s;on dictates us to look for and expect in a reve|lation from God.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="019737_0051_0FACA43AE8BB6DE0" MS="y">Sin, in the nature and tendency of it, hath an evil and ma|lignity in it which pa&s;&s;eth all conception. In its nature it is a &s;ubver&s;ion of the divine law and government, a contempt of infinite maje&s;ty and authority; robs God of his glory, Chri&s;t of his purcha&s;e, and immortal &s;ouls of eternal life: and in the finally di&s;obedient, operates an eternal reproach to the govern|ment of God, which cannot be removed but in their &s;uffering a puni&s;hment fully adequate to the evil of it. Can a tempo|rary puni&s;hment be adequate? Who will avow it? We are &s;inful and partial, finite and incompetent judges in a matter &s;o much above us: we cannot comprehend the immen&s;ity of the Divine Maje&s;ty, the infinity of his authority and of the crea|tures obligations, the worth of eternal life in his favour, of re|deeming blood and the great &s;alvation contemned, the dignity of his government, the importance and glory of his everla&s;ting kingdom in all the arrangements, connexions and de&s;igns of it, nor any one principle of a deci&s;ive judgment, whereupon we can po&s;&s;ibly determine, by rea&s;on, that a temporary puni&s;h|ment can be adequate to the evil of &s;in: But to our be&s;t ap|prehen&s;ions the contrary is apparent. Wherefore, when God, the great Governor and Judge, who has perfect knowledge of it, denounces the wages of &s;in is eternal death, it is perfectly credible; it is &s;ealed with infallibility. I wave the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject of the infinite evil and ill demerit of &s;in, becau&s;e it appears needle&s;s: it hath been maintained, by many writers, with arguments which have never been an&s;wered, and which, to me, appear unan&s;werable. Until &s;omething is adduced a|gain&s;t it more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> than hath been offered,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is objected, a finite creature cannot commit an infinite offence, to render him de&s;erving an eternal puni&s;hment. This is ea&s;ily &s;aid: But where is the proof of it? It is not &s;elf-evident, and we demand the evi|dence of it; they cannot prove it. The finite capacity of the creature is no proof; but the infinite inferiority and obligations of the finite creature, is one thing that renders the contempt of infinite Maje&s;ty, and di&s;obedience to the infinite authority of our adorable Creator and &s;upreme Lord, &s;o infi|nitely vile and heinous. Is not all &s;in infinitely offen&s;ive to God? the abo|mination which his &s;oul hateth? Who can deny it? If &s;o, is it not becau&s;e there is an infinite evil and offence in it? Do not the finally impenitent and di&s;obedient practically &s;tand in the ju&s;tification of their iniquities? And may not the Supreme Judge of the world, ju&s;tly bear an eternal te&s;timony of in|dignation again&s;t &s;uch offences and hateful characters? Men, finite as their capacities are, may commit &s;uch crimes again&s;t the &s;tate as trea&s;on, robbe|ry, murther, &amp;c. for which they may ju&s;tly be forever cut off (by capital execution) from the kingdoms and &s;tates of this world: why then may they not commit &s;uch crimes again&s;t God and his government, for which they may as righteou&s;ly be eternally cut off and excluded the kingdom of God and the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed, in a &s;tate of puni&s;hment? For if the autho|rity of God, the dignity, nece&s;&s;ity and excellence of his government, and the glory and importance of his kingdom, as far exceeds that of the &s;tates and kingdoms of this world, as &s;uch an eternal puni&s;hment exceeds their capital executions, which none can deny; then &s;uch a puni&s;hment may be as wi&s;e, righteous and nece&s;&s;ary in the divine government, as all allow tho&s;e to be which are executed by men: And the character of finite in the objection hath no weight in it. It is al&s;o objected, the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a moment, and of this &s;hort life in this world, cannot de&s;erve an eternal pu|ni&s;hment. The force of the objection lies in the &s;hortne&s;s of the time which the criminal hath lived, and in which the crime was committed. But this circum&s;tance is comparatively of no weight in judging of the de|merit of crimes. A young murtherer of twenty years old, mu&s;t as certain|ly &s;uffer death, by the laws of God and man, as one of &s;ixty or eighty years old, although he hath not lived half the time: And one who kills in&s;tantly, as another who is a longer time in perpetrating murther. It is the malignity of crimes in their nature and tendency which doth deter|mine their ill demerit, and not the circum&s;tance of time. A robber com|mits murther&mdash;he doeth it in an in&s;tant, by a blow, the thru&s;t of a &s;word, or a ball from a pi&s;tol through the head or heart: A tre&s;pa&s;&s;er goes into his neigh|bour's orchard, robs his pear-tree of &s;ix or eight bu&s;hels of excellent pears, it takes him &s;ome hours to &s;hake off, gather up and carry away the pears, and compleat his tre&s;pa&s;s&mdash;Can any one doubt which of the&s;e crimes is greate&s;t and de&s;erves the greater puni&s;hment? According to the objecti|on, the criminality and ill de&s;ert of the tre&s;pa&s;s exceeds that of the mur|ther by &s;ome hundreds of degrees, in proportion to the length of time in the perpetration of it: whereas by the common &s;en&s;e and &s;uffrage of all men, the murther is far the greater crime and de&s;erves a much &s;everer puni&s;hment; and their judgment is founded in the malignity of it, and in the nature and tendency of it. The circum&s;tance of time in the commi&s;|&s;ion of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion having but little weight with them. This well ground|ed judgment of men is weighty, but we might appeal to an infinitely greater authority to &s;ettle this point. No one &s;uppo&s;es our fir&s;t parents had lived long, or were long in the commi&s;&s;ion of the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; "in eating the forbidden fruit:" and yet for this one tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;o circum&s;tanced in re&s;pect to time, &s;in and mi&s;ery hath entered the world, a cur&s;e is denounced upon the earth, and death intailed upon our fir&s;t parents and their numerous po&s;terity in all ages to the end of the world. A convincing evidence as fact, that we can make no judgment of the malignity of &s;in and puni&s;hment which a righteous God will inflict upon the finally di&s;obedient, "from this circum&s;tance of time," and the objection hath no &s;olid weight in it, however it may &s;erve to amu&s;e, cor|rupt, and delude &s;uperficial minds. If &s;in hath not &s;uch infinite evil and ill demerit in it, as to incur an eternal forfeiture of the favour of God and ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom, where is the nece&s;&s;ity of the great propitiation and eternal redemption of Chri&s;t? And if it doth incur &s;uch a forfeiture, the wicked may righteou&s;ly be forever excluded the kingdom of God: and is not &s;uch a puni&s;hment eternal? To pur&s;ue the tenet we oppo&s;e with one con&s;equence more. If in de&s;erves but a temporary puni&s;hment, then, it &s;eems, when this puni&s;hment is endured, law and ju&s;tice are &s;atisfied, the pri&s;on doors mu&s;t be opened, the everla&s;ting chains knocked off, the pri&s;o|ner &s;et at liberty under the protection of divine government. Whether they bow to the authority of it or not, upon this principle, they cannot be any longer holden; they mu&s;t be &s;et at liberty (altho' they have all their ma|lignity and implacability about them) to roam in the dominions of God, neither ble&s;&s;ed nor cur&s;ed, belonging neither to heaven or hell, or any known place in the univer&s;e. Is this po&s;&s;ible? what more contrary to rea&s;on, and the whole tenor of the revelation of God? the ab&s;urdity of it, mu&s;t be ma|nife&s;t to all men. In what ever way we trace this tenet, the con&s;equential ab&s;urdities of it meet us and &s;tare us in the face.</NOTE> we may re&s;t in it as decided. I &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t two things more to evince the credibility of the infinite ill demerit of &s;in, and the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of it in the finally di&s;obedient. One is, that a temporary puni&s;hment is inadequate, in&s;ufficient, and cannot
<PB N="33" REF="019737_0052_0FACA43BA869EE98">
an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a final, capital puni&s;hment in the govern|ment of God. It hath been already noted, "that temporary &s;anctions and motives are altogether incongruous in nature, unequal in dignity and importance, and inadequate in energy, to the nature and &s;upport of an everla&s;ting kingdom, and to the de&s;ign of illu&s;trating an infinitely perfect government. We add, a temporary, finite puni&s;hment only, of the finally di&s;obe|dient,
<PB N="34" REF="019737_0053_0FACA43C72D64840">
cannot illu&s;trate the character of God and his perfect government, in highe&s;t glory. For &s;uch a puni&s;hment cannot illu&s;trate his immen&s;e Maje&s;ty, his infinite authority, the infinite dignity and importance of his government, together with his infinite holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and hatred of &s;in: nor finally, can it &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ecurity, peace, dignity, honour and authority of his government, as fully and effectually as though their crimes had never been committed; "the important end of all final, capital puni&s;hment." This might be illu&s;trated &s;e|veral ways&mdash;one in&s;tance is &s;ufficient to evince it. If &s;in de|&s;erves only a temporary puni&s;hment, and no more ju&s;tly can, or ever will be inflicted, then it &s;eems the everla&s;ting kingdom of the Mo&s;t High, can never be &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed in a &s;tate of eternal tranquility, &s;ecurity and peace, in infinite dignity and glory, by any puni&s;hment that can be inflicted on the ene|mies
<PB N="35" REF="019737_0054_0FACA43D2BFC0668">
of it. For no temporary puni&s;hment, however extreme and of long continuance, can change the hearts and nature of the wicked, into good &s;ubjects; and after the devil and his an|gels and the finally impenitent from this world, have endured their temporary puni&s;hment, and all that (upon this principle) can be inflicted, they may remain the inveterate enemies and di&s;turbers of it, throughout their immortal exi&s;tence. The end of final capital puni&s;hment is totally defeated. And is it po&s;&s;i|ble, that &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould ari&s;e from the nature of things, or the con&s;titution of the divine government, that the Mo&s;t High mu&s;t (in an ungovernmental manner, again&s;t the plain language of his revealed con&s;titution) either convert his implacable ene|mies into good beings, or annihilate them, or never &s;ettle his great kingdom in eternal peace, &s;ecurity, dignity and glory? This whole re&s;ult and conclu&s;ion, is &s;o abhorrent and repugnant to the &s;upreme, &s;overeign, uncontroulable and infinitely perfect dominion of God, dictated to us by rea&s;on and the revelation of God, as &s;hews the principle that inferrs it, to be ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible to be true. Whereas that puni&s;hment which is re|qui&s;ite in the nature of things to an&s;wer not only tho&s;e ends forementioned, but all the wi&s;e ends of the divine go|vernment and to the final e&s;tabli&s;hment of it in eternal &s;e|curity, peace, dignity and glory, mu&s;t be wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good; and the execution of it, upon the implacable enemies of it, mu&s;t be highly nece&s;&s;ary and important. A temporary puni&s;hment we have &s;een, is wholly inadequate and in&s;ufficient&mdash;that alone which is eternal, can and will do it; and therefore is credible. Which leads to the other particular to evince the credibility of this doctrine, viz. God hath de&s;ign|edly taught us "the infinite ill demerit of &s;in in the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, which he hath denounced again&s;t the di&s;obedient. Capital &s;tatutes and &s;anctions (in the rea&s;on &amp; nature of things) ought to be clear and determinate, both in re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are made liable to the penalty&mdash;and in the proportioning the penalty to the demerit of crimes. In this is di&s;played the wi&s;|dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s of government. Tho&s;e from heaven are perfect and without ambiguity: the&s;e &s;tatutes, &s;an|ctions and threatnings are de&s;igned to teach men the evil, ma|lignity and ill de&s;ert of the crimes; as well as the certainty of
<PB N="36" REF="019737_0055_0FACA43DEA272EF8">
the puni&s;hment annexed, upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and conviction. They do not &s;peak in &s;uch ambiguous language, they &s;hall endure &s;uch puni&s;hment whether right or wrong, whether pro|portioned to or beyond the demerit of the crimes, which would be to e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by law. But in the declaration of the puni&s;hment, we have de&s;ignedly &s;et forth the ill demerit of the crimes which &s;ubject to it, to warn and guard again&s;t the com|mi&s;&s;ion of them. And when executed, it is, among other ends of government, that others &s;eeing the great wickedne&s;s and great puni&s;hment of them "may hear and fear and do no more &s;o wickedly." Men may err in affixing puni&s;hment to crimes, but the Judge of all the earth cannot. Wherefore when he denounceth, the wages of &s;in is eternal death, and that he will puni&s;h the di&s;obedient with everla&s;ting de&s;truction&mdash;he doth de&s;ignedly teach us, that in his unerring judgment, &s;uch is the evil, malignity and ill demerit of &s;in, that it doth as righteou&s;ly de&s;erve eternal death&mdash;as wages is due to the labourer; and that he to whom vengeance belongeth, will &s;urely repay it to the finally di&s;obedient. And the&s;e truths in connection, he teach|eth us in a way mo&s;t &s;uitable to his immen&s;e wi&s;dom, maje&s;ty and authority, and to the wi&s;e and great ends of his govern|ment. When, acting in character, as &s;upreme law-giver and judge of the world, he denounceth this tremendous puni&s;hment as the ju&s;t wages of &s;in, to the workers of iniquity. And the&s;e in&s;tructions and admonitions coming from &s;uch infallible, infinite authority, are de&s;igned to convey the conviction and belief both of this ill demerit and puni&s;hment of &s;in, with deep &s;en&s;ibility and energy to the hearts and con&s;ciences of men; to re&s;train from wickedne&s;s and awaken them to repentance and life. Surely, the&s;e in&s;tructions &s;o given, are mo&s;t highly credible, upon the ground of &s;uch authority only, if the &s;eem|ing objections to our feeble rea&s;on and under&s;tanding were thou&s;and times &s;tronger, than they, are made to appear. For no truth is more &s;elf-evident, than "that the declarations of the God of truth, mu&s;t be true." In the rea&s;on of the thing, this mu&s;t conclude us, it &s;uper&s;edes and precludes all cavils and objections. To judge a priori, or any other ways, and &s;tand upon our own rea&s;on again&s;t the authority of the univer&s;e&mdash;to &s;ay it is incredible, exceeds all belief&mdash;what is it? but to op|po&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="019737_0056_0FACA43EA7D4F5E0">
our under&s;tanding, rea&s;on and erroneous judgment, to the &s;upreme wi&s;dom, unerring, infallible judgment of God, deci|&s;ively given upon the &s;ame matter, in his authorative declara|tions. And what purpo&s;e can it &s;erve? but to prevent the efficacy and defeat the wi&s;e, great and &s;alutary de&s;igns, for which they are given to men in this world. Is this rational, re&s;pectful, dutiful? will it &s;tand before the bar of rea&s;on or the tribunal of God? is not this, to make our&s;elves judges of the law, rather than the obediential receivers and improvers of it, as is de&s;igned? The &s;um of the whole is, there doth not appear a circum&s;tance of incredibility attending the great chri&s;tian doctrine of everla&s;ting rewards and puni&s;hments, when viewed and con&s;idered in its true connection. And I am full in the &s;entiment, that divine revelation is far ea&s;ier and more &s;trongly to be defended with this doctrine, than without it. The &s;ub|lime end of creation and moral government as taught us, by revelation&mdash;the rational and immortal nature wherewith we are endowed&mdash;the nature of things in a variety of views&mdash;the cha|racter and perfections of God and of his government, infinitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t, good and perfect&mdash;the property of his kingdom as everla&s;ting&mdash;the ill-demerit of &s;in&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity and impor|tance of &s;uch a puni&s;hment to his enemies, to illu&s;trate the character of God, of Chri&s;t, and of the divine government, and the doctrine of redemption in highe&s;t glory&mdash;and to e&s;tab|li&s;h the authority and &s;ettle the everla&s;ting kingdom of God, in eternal &s;ecurity and peace, in highe&s;t dignity, perfection and glory, accompanied with the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity and happine&s;s to all his holy, faithful &s;ubjects&mdash;and the cleare&s;t exhibition of the kingdom, power, and glory as the Lord's. The&s;e in connection do indicate the doctrine highly credible, worthy of all acceptation and our firme&s;t belief. Whereas, a revelation from God containing matters of &s;uch infinite mo|ment and eternal importance to the kingdom of God and his &s;ubjects, as the chri&s;tian revelation doeth; if the credit, laws and authority of it were un&s;upported; and the terms of life addre&s;&s;ed to us in it, were uninforced, with the highe&s;t &s;anctions in nature, in the univer&s;e&mdash;eternal life and eternal death, it would be very incredible. The &s;anctions being un&s;uitable to his im|men&s;e wi&s;dom, maje&s;ty and authority; to the dignity of his go|vernment
<PB N="38" REF="019737_0057_0FACA43F699ED8A0">
and importance of his everla&s;ting kingdom&mdash;and as means, inadequate to the all-important de&s;ign of &s;uch a reve|lation. Wherefore, never a doctrine came from the eternal fountain of light and truth, more credible or important to us, than that we have from the highe&s;t authority in heaven and earth&mdash;the Saviour him&s;elf&mdash;he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved,&mdash; but he who believeth not &s;hall be damned." The chri&s;tian, it &s;eems, needeth not to have any unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions; from all the arguments and in&s;inuations of Dei&s;t, &s;ocinians and uni|ver&s;ali&s;ts which can be brought out of the dark cell of &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity, again&s;t the credibility, of the chri&s;tian doctrine, of the everla&s;ting de&s;truction of the finally di&s;obedient."</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words point us to the final de&s;truction of the de|vil's kingdom; when he him&s;elf and his wicked adher|ents &s;hall be con&s;igned to an eternal puni&s;hment. They &s;hew us the dreadful end of the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet&mdash;the two greate&s;t, longe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful apo&s;tacies and corruptions of this world, inimical to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and in &s;upport of that kingdom as de&s;cribed in this prophecy. The devil that deceived them, and the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet, (all the delu|ded wicked under the&s;e di&s;criptions) are here repre&s;ented, as "in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone, and to be tormented day and night forever and ever." Surely the triumph of the wick|ed is &s;hort, for here is the tremendous de&s;truction of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous, powerful and triumphantly wicked on earth. And the &s;ame puni&s;hment is re&s;erved for all the finally wicked of this world, who are expre&s;sly con&s;igned to it in the la&s;t ver&s;e of
<PB N="39" REF="019737_0058_0FACA44071DB2B18">
the context: "And who&s;oever was not found written in the book of life, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire." So that it is a mo&s;t alarming, intere&s;ting &s;ubject to all, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>There are two particulars of this future puni&s;hment clearly held forth in the text, which lead directly to our main &s;ubject, viz.&mdash;"it will be continual and endle&s;s"&mdash;"it is the &s;ame puni&s;hment prepared for the devil and his angels, and to be en|dured by the wicked throughout the &s;ame duration with theirs, which we know to be eternal." A puni&s;hment not only ex|treme in degree, and as hopele&s;s of re&s;titution and deliverance as the being ca&s;t into a lake of fire and brim&s;tone, but al&s;o un|cea&s;ing, perpetual and eternal. For what words can expre&s;s it &s;tronger than the text; "and &s;hall be tormented day and night forever and ever." The&s;e are among the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of eternity to be found in the book of God. And it is to be noted, that the phra&s;e "forever and ever," is never once applied to de&s;truction but to denote it to be perpetual&mdash; as exclu&s;ive of all idea and hope of re&s;toration. So it is appli|ed by the prophet to denote a perpetual de&s;truction. I&s;ai. 34.10. "It &s;hall not be quenched night nor day, the &s;moke there|of &s;hall go up forever: from generation to generation it &s;hall lie wa&s;te; none &s;hall pa&s;s through it forever and ever." And &s;o it is applied to the de&s;truction of the enemies of the chri&s;tian church. Rev. 19.3. "And her &s;moke rofe up forever and ever." And that per&s;onal &s;ufferings are de&s;igned, &s;eems evident from the parallel di&s;cription, chap. 14.11.
<Q>and the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth forever and ever.</Q>
Wherefore, to tho&s;e who &s;uffer the future puni&s;hment, there will be no an|nihilation and ce&s;&s;ation of exi&s;tence&mdash;no deliverence&mdash;no ce&s;|&s;ation nor end to their torment and mi&s;ery. This mu&s;t be the meaning, the doctrine de&s;ignedly taught by the &s;pirit of truth in our text, when, in a literal di&s;cription of it, he a&s;&s;ures us "they &s;hall be tormented day and night forever and ever."</P>
<P>But in direct oppo&s;ition to it, the Univer&s;ali&s;ts maintain; &s;ome, that there will be no future puni&s;hment to the wicked; others, that there will be an end and a re&s;titution of all the wicked to the heavenly happine&s;s, in &s;ome future period; after long and dreadful &s;ufferings in hell.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="019737_0059_0FACA44126EE1C38">What I de&s;ign is (in &s;ubver&s;ion of their horrid error) to con|firm the doctrine in the text, and make evident "that the fu|ture puni&s;hment of the wicked will mo&s;t certainly be hopele&s;s of e&s;cape or re&s;titution&mdash;perpetual and eternal;" by &s;hewing</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The tenor of all the threatnings and all di&s;criptions of the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, &s;trongly import it hopele&s;s of re&s;titution, unlimited and endle&s;s as their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It is confirmed by a variety of mo&s;t pointed declara|tions, fitted and de&s;igned of God, to cut off all pre&s;umption and hope of e&s;cape or re&s;titution to the wicked that die in their &s;ins.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is further confirmed by the con&s;titution of nature, which connects &s;in and mi&s;ery together, and will make the fi|nally wicked nece&s;&s;arily mi&s;erable, as long as they have exi&s;t|ence, unle&s;s this con&s;titution be annulled or &s;uper&s;eded by the grace of God, the author of it; which, by many declarations, he a&s;&s;ures us &s;hall never be.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. It is abundantly confirmed by and throughout the whole con&s;titution of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The doctrine of the future puni&s;hment we maintain, in oppo&s;ition to theirs, was fully believed by the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian church, and by their in&s;pired teachers.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The doctrine of the la&s;t, the eternal judgment, &s;et forth in the word of God, and particularly by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, is deci&s;ive of this controver&s;y: "That the &s;en|tence and puni&s;hment of the wicked will be eternal."</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place&mdash;When we attend to the manner in which this doctine is revealed, we &s;ee "the tenor of all the threat|nings and all de&s;criptions of the future puni&s;hment of the wick|ed &s;trongly import it hopele&s;s of re&s;titution, unlimited and end|le&s;s as their exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t threatning in the book of God, denouncing the puni&s;hment of &s;in in the&s;e words, "in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 2.17. Heb. dying thou &s;halt die.</NOTE> imports an eternal exclu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in mi&s;ery as la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence. Death being directly oppo&s;ed to life and happine&s;s, this mu&s;t be the imported puni&s;hment upon every con&s;truction of it. This puni&s;hment is &s;urely the ju&s;t wages of &s;in, and certainly to be executed upon the di&s;obedient in a &s;tate of retribution,
<PB N="41" REF="019737_0060_0FACA441AF609DC8">
or it would not have been threatned by a God of truth and ju&s;|tice. This is the awful &s;anction to &s;upport the law, authority and government of God, over all the moral world, and in eve|ry con&s;titution of his government. We rationally conclude it of the con&s;titution of angels, becau&s;e this is the puni&s;hment to which the apo&s;tate angels are con&s;igned in a &s;tate of retri|bution. We &s;ee it was the awful &s;anction of the con&s;titution of man in innocency; and we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee it to be the &s;anc|tion of the divine government to mankind under a di&s;pen&s;ati|on of mercy. If this puni&s;hment is the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in, and a wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary &s;anction of the moral government of God, it is a di&s;honourable reflection on the wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, truth and ju&s;tice of God to &s;uppo&s;e a le&s;s puni&s;hment will ever be denounced or executed upon the wicked in a &s;tate of retri|bution. And if this &s;anction was wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary to man|kind in a &s;tate of rectitude, &s;urely, it cannot be le&s;s wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary to them in a &s;tate of degeneracy and corruption: but "as the law was made for the lawle&s;s, and added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions," &s;o we rationally conclude, that this puni&s;hment to the wicked in a &s;tate of retribution, will be held up to a pe|ri&s;hing world in clear, full, deci&s;ive language, of the &s;ame aw|ful import with the fir&s;t threatning; "hopele&s;s of eternal life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and their mi&s;ery as la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence." And the revelations of God do abundantly confirm this dictate of rea&s;on; a&s;&s;uring us this eternal death as contra&s;ted with eter|nal life, is "the wages of &s;in," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6. ult.</NOTE> as ju&s;tly the demerit of &s;in, as the wages due to a labourer, and &s;urely "to be repayed" in a &s;tate of retribution. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 7.10.</NOTE> It is to be noted, this future puni&s;h|ment is con&s;tantly repre&s;ented as "without limitation or end." It is &s;aid of the wicked, "they &s;hall be accur&s;ed and &s;eparated to evil" <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 29.20, 21.</NOTE> or mi&s;ery&mdash;"are appointed to wrath"&mdash;"&s;hall be turned into hell." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 9.17.</NOTE> Repeatedly, "that they &s;hall be ca&s;t out into outer darkne&s;s, where is weeping, wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth"&mdash;&s;hall be "ca&s;t into the lake of fire which is the &s;econd death"&mdash;con&s;igned to this &s;tate of puni&s;hment without any li|mitation or end put to it. And it is to be further ob&s;erved, that this puni&s;hment is commonly repre&s;ented in terms directly oppo&s;ite and exclu&s;ive of life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; as death, the
<PB N="42" REF="019737_0061_0FACA4426E40ED58">
&s;econd death, de&s;truction, perdition, damnation, &amp;c. The de&s;truction and death of the wicked is directly oppo&s;ed to their life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s&mdash;the perdition, utter ruin of the un|godly is hopele&s;s of a re&s;toration or re&s;titution to life and hap|pine&s;s &mdash;the damnation of hell is directly and fully contra&s;ted with the go&s;pel &s;alvation and enjoyment of eternal life&mdash;and this puni&s;hment, in every form of repre&s;entation, announced by the &s;pirit of truth without any limitation, period or end. If there be any period to it, if any limitation or termination of it, let them who a&s;&s;ume it for truth &s;hew it; it belongs to them who a&s;&s;ert it to &s;hew it. It is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;they give up the cau&s;e, by telling us "their pain will be unutterable and for a long duration&mdash;(God only knows how long.")<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Salvation for all men, p. 24.</NOTE> This is a plain, full conce&s;&s;ion, that God, who only can bound it, has declared no limitation, puts no period to it. How pre&s;ump|tuous then, for man to &s;ay there will be an end to it? For what is the plain import of a puni&s;hment without limitation, in the con&s;truction of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e? If a criminal among men is &s;entenced to impri&s;onment for one or &s;ix months, for three or &s;even years, he and we know the period: or if it be during plea&s;ure, there is a hope of relief, and means for it may be u&s;ed: but if the con&s;ignment be unlimited, without day, it is deci&s;ively for life or during his exi&s;tence in this world, in the common acceptation of all mankind. By this rule then, as the future puni&s;hment of the wicked is con&s;tantly and uniformly (in every form and de&s;cription of it) repre&s;ented to us without limitation, period or end, it &s;trongly and deci&s;ively imports it to be as durable and la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence and immortality. And this con&s;truction is confirmed "by the key of doctrine St. Paul gives us, for a &s;ure and deci&s;ive interpretation of the things of the future and invi&s;ible world." It is in tho&s;e words 2 Cor. 4.18. "For the things which are &s;een are temporal, (are tem|porary and will have an end) but the things which are not &s;een (in the future world of which he is &s;peaking) are eternal;" without a &s;ingle exception, and will have no end. Paul was bred a Phari&s;ee, early imbibed the doctrine of the Phari&s;ees and of the Jewi&s;h church, who (except the Sadducees who were a &s;ort of infidels) uniformly believed the doctrine of the
<PB N="43" REF="019737_0062_0FACA443293A5628">
exi&s;tence of angels and devils&mdash;of the &s;pirits of mankind both good and bad in a future &s;tate&mdash;and that they were all immor|tal, their exi&s;tence without end. They believed God to be the rewarder of them who diligently &s;eek him, and the aven|ger of the wicked: and in connexion herewith, they believed the future invi&s;ible world to be a &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments &mdash;they believed a heaven and hell&mdash;that the rewards of the righteous in heaven would be eternal, and the puni&s;hment of the wicked in hell would likewi&s;e be eternal. And this was the rea&s;on why the Phari&s;ees with all their carping di&s;po&s;ition, never once objected to the doctrine of our Saviour, when he &s;o clearly, plainly and repeatedly taught the doctrine of the ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment of the wicked, and in a manner &s;ufficient|ly galling to them. They could not do it, becau&s;e it was their own profe&s;&s;ed faith, and that of the Jewi&s;h church. Nor doth Paul, when converted to the faith of Chri&s;t, alter a &s;in|gle article in this creed; for in the&s;e great doctrines of Godli|ne&s;s, the faith of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian church is one. Paul, a chri&s;tian and an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, teaches the church and world, "that the things of the future and invi&s;ible world, are all (without di&s;tinction or a &s;ingle exception) eternal." Then heaven and hell are &s;o&mdash;then the character, &s;tate and ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of the righteous in that world is fixed and eternal&mdash; and likewi&s;e the character, &s;tate and puni&s;hment of the wick|ed in that world is fixed and eternal. And this key of in&s;pi|ration ought to be deci&s;ive with chri&s;tians of all generations. E&s;pecially, as there is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance in all revelation of a period put to any of the things of the invi&s;ible &s;tate, which the apo&s;tle announces to the world, are all "eternal." How un&s;criptural and ab&s;urd their notion of a next &s;tate, as tempo|rary, when it is directly excluded and con&s;uted by this rule of in&s;piration. Is this puni&s;hment commonly repre&s;ented in terms, which of their own force imply an eternal exclu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in mi&s;ery, as la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence? and always &s;et forth without limitation or end? doth rea&s;on teach us that &s;uch a repre&s;entation of it, imports it to be as durable and la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence? and is it a&s;certained by the rule of in&s;piration before us, that it will be eternal? this ought to conclude our belief of it, as the truth of God.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="019737_0063_0FACA443EC8D0780">We add, this con&s;truction &s;eems further confirmed, by the doctrine of re&s;titution as taught us by in&s;piration. For where re&s;titution from threatned de&s;truction is de&s;igned, the hope of it is u&s;ually &s;et forth and accompanies, or is annexed to the repre&s;entation of the judgment and de&s;ola|tion: and is taught with clearne&s;s according to its im|portance, by the &s;pirit of in&s;piration. There is a perfection in all God's works: a wi&s;dom and perfection in the manner as well as matter of divine revelation. We therefore rationally expect, a &s;imilarity in the repre&s;entation of the &s;ame kind of &s;ubjects. "Where de&s;truction is denounced but re&s;titution is de&s;igned, we find the hope of it, u&s;ually accompanies it." And the wi&s;dom and importance of this mode of in&s;truction, is ob|vious: "that the Lord may be enquired of, to do it for them," &amp;c. Thus, de&s;truction is denounced again&s;t Moab, but with a hope God would not make an end. And the de&s;cription of the judgment clo&s;es,&mdash;"yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, &s;aith the Lord," Jer. 43.47. When de&s;truction is denounced but re&s;titution is de&s;igned, frequently the preci&s;e period of the de&s;truction and of the commencement of the re&s;titution is fixed: and &s;ometimes the in&s;trument, means and circum&s;tances of it, are de&s;cribed. Seventy years, Tyre &s;hall be de&s;olate and forgotten: and at the end of &s;eventy years her vi&s;itation and re&s;titution is announced by the prophet, I&s;a. 23.15, 16, 17, 18. Every one knows, the period of the jewi&s;h de&s;truction and captivity in Babylon was fixed, at &s;even|ty years: with repeated declarations, God would not make a full end, would correct them in mea&s;ure; and accompanied with many and &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of their re&s;titution: the in|&s;trument and means of it de&s;cribed by the hand and procla|mation of Cyrus.</P>
<P>In the judgment and de&s;olation denounced upon Egypt, the period of it is fixed at forty years. The circum&s;tances of its re&s;titution are de&s;cribed, with its di&s;tingui&s;hing character (a ba&s;e, low, the ba&s;e&s;t of all kingdoms) fixed for ages. Ezek. 29.13, 14, 15, 16. The prediction of the de&s;truction of this once great kingdom, and re&s;titution of this low, ba&s;e kingdom, was of importance to "remind and &s;hame I&s;rael for their folly and wickedne&s;s in withdrawing their tru&s;t from God, and pla|cing

it upon this broken reed:" and likewi&s;e to be a clear, &s;trong atte&s;tation and confirmation of the doctrine of in&s;pirati|on to pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and future ages, as long as it &s;hall have ex|i&s;tence. But this and the other re&s;titutions which have been mentioned, are comparitively of no moment to the great re&s;ti|tution of all the damned in hell they tell of: therefore, if this la&s;t be a doctrine of in&s;piration, we rationally expect at lea&s;t as clear, particular, deci&s;ive and circum&s;tantial a de&s;cription of it. Surely the high importance of it be&s;peaks it. Can we find it? In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ited in&s;tances, the people concerned and others, have not to go "to prophetic, figurative de&s;criptions and univer&s;al terms belonging entirely to other &s;ubjects, and not to the doctrine of their de&s;truction, to find their hope of re|&s;titution: No, they and we find their hope of re&s;titution at hand, as accompanying the de&s;cription of their puni&s;hment, or annexed to it. Here then, by the rule and method of in&s;pi|ration, we expect to find their doctrine of future re&s;titution, if any where. Do any of the in&s;pired writers &s;et a period to the future puni&s;hment? Do they annex a hope of re&s;titution to any one of their de&s;criptions of it? Do they tell us the author, the means, or a &s;ingle &s;yllable of a circum&s;tance about it? no, there is a perfect &s;ilence reigns through the &s;cripture as to this doctrine: and all the de&s;criptions of that puni&s;hment are deci|&s;ively without limitation, period or end. Their doctrine of re&s;titution, is then an un&s;criptural, groundle&s;s, hopele&s;s delu&s;i|on. The in&s;pired writers put no period to the future puni&s;h|ment: they annex no hope of re&s;titution to them who peri&s;h in it. We infer, they had no commi&s;&s;ion from heaven to do it, or certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey would have done it. The conclu&s;ion is, no per&s;on on ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th ever had or now hath commi&s;&s;ion from God to teach &s;uch a doctrine: they prophecy the deceit of their own hearts, or the in&s;tigation of the wicked one. To proceed, we find the true doctrine of re&s;titution taught with great clear|ne&s;s and oft repetitions according to the importance of it. Thus the re&s;titution of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, is taught with great clearne&s;s and oft repetitions, by the prophets I&s;aiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Almo&s;t whole chapters are ta|ken up by the prophet Jeremiah in the mo&s;t &s;trong, literal and figurative de&s;criptions and a&s;&s;urances of it; as 24th and others.

And that great re&s;toration to take place before the end of the world, in the final, general call of the Jews and Gentile nati|ons into the kingdom of God, is a grand &s;ubject of revelation, taught by Mo&s;es and the prophets, our Saviour and his apo&s;|tles: it is very often repeated by the prophets, taught by our Saviour in his parables: and it is ob&s;ervable he gives to the Jews their hope of the re&s;toration of their nation and the time of it, in his denunciation of their de&s;truction and that of Jeru|&s;alem.

<P>Moreover, when the&s;e mo&s;t illu&s;trious works of divine grace &s;hall be wrought in our world, illu&s;trating the grace of God and the honour of the Saviour in great glory, and in which the happine&s;s of millions and millions and all the nations of the earth are concerned, in the ingathering of the fullne&s;s of Jews and of Gentiles in the millenium &s;tate; we find this re&s;titution de&s;cribed and exhibited according to the importance of it, in the mo&s;t lively, bold, &s;trong, literal and figurative de&s;criptions humane language is capable of&mdash;"by the binding of &s;atan" &mdash;"the reigning of Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years"&mdash;"by a new hea|vens and a new earth" &amp;c. &amp;c. and heaven and earth called to rejoice in it. It is a divine reality, and will be accompanied with very great rejoicings in heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Now&punc; if the doctrine of the re&s;titution of all the damned in hell, was a divine reality, and a doctrine of &s;uch glory as is pre|tended, "the very glory of the go&s;pel;" we rationally con|clude we &s;hould have had it as clearly &s;tate&punc; as oft repeated, and &s;et forth with equal &s;olemnity, pomp and energy of lan|guage; that heaven, earth and hell would ring with the tidings: and hell indeed would be no more hell, that place of weeping, wailing and torment it is con&s;tantly repre&s;ented to be, but a place of the greate&s;t mercy and joy. Do we find it &s;o? Not a &s;ingle &s;yllable of any deliverance out of it, and nothing of a de&s;cription an&s;werable to the great importance of it, if there was any truth in it. Contrary wi&s;e, hell is con&s;tantly repre|&s;ented as a place or &s;tate of wrath without mercy&mdash;of torment without joy&mdash;and where the con&s;igned to it, "&s;hall be tor|mented day and night forever and ever." And can there be a

more manife&s;t, barefaced delu&s;ion than their doctrine is? One in&s;tance more upon the doctrine of re&s;titution. Natural death is a great de&s;truction&mdash;it is univer&s;al to mankind; but re&s;tituti|on is de&s;igned. It is included in the fir&s;t promi&s;e after the apo&s;tacy, before the &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed. And the doctrine of the re&s;urrection runs through the revelations of God. We know the period of death's reign and of the commencement of the re&s;urrection is fixed. When the la&s;t trumpet &s;hall found, the great day of the re&s;urrection &s;hall commence. We know the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances of the re&s;urrection, both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t. The bodies of the righteous &s;hall ari&s;e &s;piritual, powerful, glorious, immortal in an everla&s;ting life: but the wicked &s;hall ari&s;e to everla&s;ting &s;hame, contempt and damnation. The&s;e are in&s;tances and illu&s;trations of the true &s;cripture doctrine of re&s;titution. Is their's like it? In no in|&s;tance, in no one important circum&s;tance. It is no more like it than the delu&s;ions of &s;atan commonly are to the truths of God. If therefore we make the &s;cripture doctrine of re&s;tituti|on our rule in judging upon the &s;ubject, (and we have none other, their doctrine being oppo&s;ite to the method in which the true doctrine is con&s;tantly revealed, there being no hope of &s;uch re&s;titution accompanying or annexed to any one de&s;cripti|on of the future puni&s;hment, and not a &s;ingle de&s;cription of it, much le&s;s with a clearne&s;s, repetition, &s;olemnity and energy an|&s;werable to its importance) we mu&s;t judge it an incredible and mo&s;t pernicious delu&s;ion. And we &s;hall &s;ee it every way ex|cluded, confuted, and reprobated in &s;cripture before we have done with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in as much as the future puni&s;hment is common|ly repre&s;ented in terms oppo&s;ite and exclu&s;ive of life and ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s, and in every de&s;cription of it without limitation or end, by the con&s;truction of rea&s;on&mdash;the expre&s;s rule of the apo&s;tle, and the &s;cripture doctrine of re&s;titution it&s;elf; it is &s;trongly imported, to be without end, without hope and eternal.</P>
<P>It is to be remembered, that this puni&s;hment is not only thus &s;trongly imported, in every de&s;cription, but it is al&s;o purpo&s;e|ly, expre&s;sly, repeatedly, literally taught and a&s;&s;erted to be eternal; in terms, words and phra&s;es emphatically expre&s;&s;ive of eternity.

It is "forever," "ever|la&s;ting," "and forever and ever;" and this la&s;t phra&s;e "fore|ver and ever" is emphatically expre&s;&s;ive of eternity as appli|ed to God, to denote and de&s;cribe the eternity of his exi&s;tence, of his attributes, of his throne and kingdom, &amp;c. and as de|&s;criptive of his &s;aints everla&s;ting happine&s;s: and no le&s;s em|phatical as de&s;criptive of the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of the wick|ed: it being never applied to de&s;truction but to denote it per|petual, as exclu&s;ive of all idea and hope of deliverance or re&s;to|ration, as before noted. Can there be a more certain rule to fix the meaning of a phra&s;e, than the perpetual, unvaried u&s;e of it throughout in&s;piration? If this will not do it, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to be done. And it is ob&s;ervable, that the very fame words and phra&s;eology is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the perpetual, uncea&s;ing and eternal duration of the glory and happine&s;s of the righteous and of the puni&s;hment of the wicked: as in the &s;entence of the la&s;t judgment, and the phra&s;eology in the text "day and night forever and ever." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Mat. 25.

The&s;e are figurative de&s;criptions of their hopele&s;s &s;tate, given by our Lord him&s;elf.

It is &s;et forth by devouring fire, that &s;hall devour the adver&s;aries&mdash;by eternal fire&mdash;everla&s;ting burn|ings; emphatically the everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And if po&s;&s;ible yet more &s;trongly, by un|quenchable fire, that in the principle of it cannot be quenched; "a fire that &s;hall never be quenched"&mdash;"a worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched." Our Lord has taught us in the 25th of Matthew, what he means by this fire, the fire of hell. In the 41&s;t ver&s;e he tells us, the wicked &s;hall depart into everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. And in the la&s;t ver&s;e he tells us his meaning without a figure, literal|ly, "they &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment." By this key therefore, by unquenchable fire he mu&s;t mean literal|ly "endle&s;s puni&s;hment"&mdash;"by the worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched, a fire that &s;hall never be quenched," he mu&s;t mean a puni&s;hment that hath not and never &s;hall have an end.

again, as contra&s;ted with the enjoyment of eternal life and the inheriting the kingdom of God (in the&s;e figurative de&s;criptions of it) as of very great importance to be mo&s;t firmly believed and realized; in Mark 9.43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. In each de|&s;cription the being ca&s;t into hell&mdash;into hell fire, is contra&s;ted with the entering into life or the kingdom of God: and the impo&s;&s;ibility of the latter, is &s;trongly held forth in the endle&s;s duration of this puni&s;hment: denoted by unquenchable fire, a fire that &s;hall never be quenched, a worm that dieth not and a fire that is not quenched; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">To &s;ay this declaration of Chri&s;t, &s;o oft and &s;olemnly repeated, can prove no more "than that the torments of the wicked &s;hall la&s;t as long as their next &s;tate of exi&s;tence la&s;teth, without determining how long that &s;hall be," is to evade and glo&s;s away the very &s;pirit of the text, and avails not; becau&s;e the Jews and di&s;ciples knew and believed in no other next &s;tate, but that which is eternal; and the words are mo&s;t forcibly de&s;crip|tive of an eternal puni&s;hment: and therefore in no other &s;en&s;e could it be taken by them, or de&s;igned by our Lord. Neither doth it any more avail to &s;ay, "that the words are taken from the prophecy of I&s;aiah," and allude to the puni&s;hment of burning dead bodies, or permitting them to lie above ground to be de&s;troyed of worms&mdash;and "that the fire and worm" can in no other &s;en&s;e be &s;aid "not to be quenched, and not to die;" but as they would continue till the carca&s;es were con&s;umed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salv. for all men, p. 23.</NOTE> For the idea of re&s;titution, deliverance or removal of the bodies from this &s;tate of puni&s;hment, is to|tally excluded and reprobated in their own con&s;truction. They &s;hall ne|ver be removed from the power of the fire and worm, till utter de&s;truction be compleated. And what are the characters of this puni&s;hment &s;o de&s;cri|bed? It is final for this world&mdash;it is unchangeable, there is no deliver|ance out of it&mdash;and it is as la&s;ting as the &s;ubjects of the puni&s;hment; the carca&s;es to which it is applied. So when it is applied to the future world, the &s;ame characters go along with the de&s;cription of it. It is final for the world to come&mdash;it is unchangeable, and there is no deliverance out of it&mdash; and it is as la&s;ting as the immortality of the &s;ubjects of it. So that the genuine proper force of their own con&s;truction, is perdition to their own &s;cheme, and a confirmation of the truth. And this is not only the nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;truction, and the terms &s;uch as will admit of no other, but it is evidently de&s;igned by our Lord. For if he had de&s;igned only to teach them, that the wicked &s;hould endure the future torments, without deter|mining the duration of them, it was &s;ufficient to tell them they &s;hould be ca&s;t into hell fire, for this is de&s;criptive of the future puni&s;hment, and never once u&s;ed but to expre&s;s it. On this &s;uppo&s;ition there needed no more; and the additional de&s;cription &s;o oft repeated, as inculcating and impre&s;|&s;ing &s;omething of very great importance, is rendered entirely needle&s;s, nu|gatory and vain. We are therefore con&s;trained to conclude, that our Lord doth de&s;ignedly give us a de&s;cription of the perpetuity as well as extremi|ty of that puni&s;hment. And he doth in fact repre&s;ent the uncea&s;ing, end|le&s;s duration of it figuratively, "by the fire that is not quenched, and &s;hall never be quenched, and a worm that dieth not," with as &s;trong force as can be literally done by endle&s;s, eternal, or any words that can be u&s;ed. So that there is no evading the force of this text by any cavil or critici&s;m whatever. It mocks and defies the vain and profane attempt.</NOTE> and &s;o often repeated. If the metaphorical worm con&s;cience dieth not, i.e. will never cea&s;e to accu&s;e and torment them, it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible but that their puni&s;hment &s;hould be as la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence: "the &s;moke of their torment (is &s;aid) to a&s;cend forever and ever." If their torments be not eternal, the figure of it "the &s;moke of it a&s;cending forever and ever," could be neither true nor pro|per. On the whole, the figurative di&s;criptions of this puni&s;h|ment, are the mo&s;t &s;trong and emphatical in nature; all of the &s;ame import with the literal and deci&s;ive of it; hopele&s;s of re|&s;titution
<PB N="51" REF="019737_0070_0FACA4496A476CE0">
and of endle&s;s duration. Furthermore the &s;cripture examples of this puni&s;hment, are equally deci&s;ive of it, hope|le&s;s of re&s;titution and eternal. In&s;piration &s;ets forth three re|markable en&s;amples of it&mdash;the de&s;truction of the old world in the flood&mdash;of Sodom and Ghomorrah con&s;umed by fire from heaven&mdash;and of the unbelieving I&s;raelites who peri&s;hed in the wilderne&s;s, excluded God's re&s;t, both by the oath and con&s;um|ing wrath of God. Now, in each of the&s;e en&s;amples, there is an open, vi&s;ible, and eternal &s;eparation between the righteons and the wicked&mdash;never to be re-united in this world. In each example, the wicked are de&s;troyed in a di&s;pen&s;ation of wrath only, without mercy; in &s;upport of the authority and govern|ment of God and for the good of others, but no benefit to them&s;elves: and in each the de&s;truction is hopele&s;s of re&s;titu|tion, and the re&s;titution barred by an impo&s;&s;ibility, natural, moral or both, as will be &s;hewn in another place. So that it &s;eems, no examples of the future puni&s;hment could be pre&s;ent|ed to the eye of man in this &s;tate, more in point and more ab&s;o|lutely deci&s;ive of it "as hopele&s;s and endle&s;s," than the&s;e which in&s;piration gives us. We add one thing more to a&s;certain this point, viz. The future puni&s;hment of the wicked will be the &s;ame&mdash;in the &s;ame place of torment, and as la&s;ting, the &s;ame in duration with the devil and his angels; which we know to be hopele&s;s of re&s;titution and eternal.

And in our text they are de&s;cri|bed as ca&s;t and tormented together "in the lake of fire and brim|&s;tone forever and ever:" determinately repre&s;enting the &s;ame pu|ni&s;hment with the &s;ame duration.

This was the doctrine of the jewi&s;h church, and receiv|ed by the in&s;pired apo&s;tles and chri&s;tian church, in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t age of it. For it is a principle with them, not only of in&s;truction, admonition, and warning, as u&s;ed in &s;everal of the &s;acred epi&s;tles, but of &s;trict rea&s;oning and argumentation. So it is improved by St. James in the 2d chap. of his epi&s;tle, in ar|guing again&s;t a fal&s;e, dead faith, without works, that it cannot &s;ave no more than that of the devil's. Now, if it was not a truth that the devils &s;hould never be &s;aved, an in&s;pired apo&s;tle would not have a&s;&s;umed it as true, and as a principle of argumentati|on. And if it was not a truth, his de&s;igned conclu&s;ion would not follow, viz. that the &s;ubjects of a fal&s;e faith, living and dy|ing &s;o, could not be &s;aved. Again, if it was not an univer&s;al|ly acknowledged truth in the church of God, the argument could not carry univer&s;al conviction in it, as it is manife&s;tly de|&s;igned to do. The conclu&s;ion therefore is, that it is a certain truth that the devils &s;hall never be &s;aved. Their puni&s;hment will be eternal, and that of the wicked equally durable, hope|le&s;s of re&s;titution and everla&s;ting. Now let it be noted, that this doctrine of the future puni&s;hment runs through the revela|tions of God, from the fir&s;t threatning in paradi&s;e, to the 15th ver&s;e of the la&s;t chapter of revelations. And that it ap|pears in the whole repre&s;entation to be de&s;cribed and delivered to the world with alike clearne&s;s, con&s;i&s;tency, preci&s;ion and perfection as other great doctrines (&s;uch as relate to the Me&s;&s;i|ah, to the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the righteous, &amp;c.&amp;c.) which run through the revelations of God. And can there in this view of it, be a doubt whether this puni&s;hment be revealed to
<PB N="53" REF="019737_0072_0FACA44B6D89B700">
us to be temporary or eternal? The one or the other it mu&s;t be, and is de&s;igned to be a&s;certained. Is it revealed as temporary and as what will have an end, when there is no period put to it expre&s;sly, by intimation or implication in any one de&s;cripti|on of it what&s;oever? By no means. Is it not determinately and deci&s;ively revealed of God to be eternal, taking the &s;everal de&s;criptions and whole exhibitions of the doctrine together? Clearly: for thus it &s;tands in the book of God. The fir&s;t threatning imports this puni&s;hment for &s;in, to be an eternal ex|clu&s;ion from life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in mi&s;ery as la&s;ting as their exi&s;tence. It is frequently de&s;cribed by the &s;ame word, and in words and terms of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me import, and con&s;tantly without a &s;ingle variation, without period, end or limitation. It is of|ten in the old te&s;tament and new, literally taught and a&s;&s;erted to be eternal, in words and phra&s;es the mo&s;t &s;trong and em|phatical, expre&s;&s;ive of eternity, that are u&s;ed in the book of God. All the figurative de&s;criptions of it are equally deci&s;ive of it, as hopele&s;s of re&s;titution and of endle&s;s duration. Seve|ral of which can have no meaning if they do not mean endle&s;s; or mu&s;t have a meaning contradictory to the terms in which it is expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;cripture examples have deci&s;ively the &s;ame language and import. And this puni&s;hment is &s;et forth as eternal, by way of disjunction and oppo&s;ition, as contra&s;ted with the everla&s;ting life of the righteous, by a phra&s;e mo&s;t deci&s;ive of perpetual and endle&s;s. The puni&s;hment and happine&s;s both &s;aid to be "day and night forever and ever." And it is as de|ci&s;ively &s;et forth by way of connexion, the puni&s;hment of the wicked the &s;ame, and of the &s;ame duration with the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of the devil and his angels. On the whole, it is evident the duration of this puni&s;hment is de&s;igned to be re|vealed and a&s;certained to us. And can it be more &s;o than in having all the parts, de&s;criptions, and whole exhibition of one import, and centuring in one point, endle&s;s? Can this impor|tant doctrine which runs through the revelation of God, be &s;o revealed to us without de&s;ign, when de&s;ign is &s;o &s;trongly mark|ed through the whole? Or can any thing be de&s;igned le&s;s, or any otherwi&s;e than what is clearly, plainly, fully and deci&s;ive|ly repre&s;ented and imported through the whole? It is impo&s;&s;i|ble; becau&s;e it implies de&s;igned fal&s;hood and deception, de|&s;tructive
<PB N="54" REF="019737_0073_0FACA44C2AD7BE30">
of the moral character of God, and of the doctrine of in&s;piration. Mo&s;t certain then it is, that this puni&s;hment, in all its everla&s;ting terrors, will be executed upon the wicked, in the future and eternal &s;tate. God hath de&s;igned it&mdash;hath re|vealed it&mdash;is able and re&s;olved to do it: and his wi&s;dom, holi|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice, truth and immutability in&s;ure the dreadful execu|tion. For the truth and immutability of God are as truly con|cerned in the execution of his threatnings, as his promi&s;es. So taught the prophet Samuel, "the &s;trength of I&s;rael will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man that he &s;hould repent."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel 15.29.</NOTE> One would apprehend by the united force of all this evidence the conclu&s;ion &s;hould be clear to an unbia&s;&s;ed mind. If lan|guage hath any fixed, determinate meaning&mdash;or if all kinds of de&s;cription can deci&s;ively determine any point of doctrine&mdash; if the import of terms u&s;ed, and the manner in which they are always invariably u&s;ed of a &s;ubject, without end&mdash;together with literal and figurative de&s;criptions, confirmed by examples, by contra&s;t and by connexion, all deci&s;ively fixing the &s;ame con&s;truction of a doctrine, can a&s;certain the meaning and truth of it; then this doctrine of the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of the wicked, is a&s;certained unto us: and we are bound to believe and receive it upon the authority of God, the adorable reveal|er of it. And there is nothing which relates to this doctrine as it &s;tands in the book of God, to induce the lea&s;t doubt about it. And nothing in rea&s;on, or relating to any other doctrine, which ought to have any influence to it. To &s;ay it is incredible; what is it but to oppo&s;e our folly to divine wi&s;dom&mdash;to im|peach the wi&s;dom and truth of God? To &s;ay the original word tran&s;lated eternal, "&s;ignifies &s;ometimes a definite and &s;ome|times an indefinite duration, and the nature of the &s;ubject to which it is applied mu&s;t a&s;certain its meaning," avails nothing in this ca&s;e: For this doctrine doth not &s;tand or re&s;t upon a &s;ingle word. The whole exhibition of this future puni&s;hment, in every de&s;cription of it, is endle&s;s. Wherefore, when the &s;pirit of truth de&s;cribes it literally in perfect agreement with every other de&s;cription, with the import of every particular and the whole, &s;o applied and in &s;uch connexion, it fixes the mean|ing to be &s;trictly eternal. And the meaning is likewi&s;e fixed
<PB N="55" REF="019737_0074_0FACA44CF84E3710">
by their own rule, viz. by the nature of the &s;ubject to which it is applied. When applied to God and his attributes, which are infinite and eternal, then &s;ay they, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood &s;trictly and deci&s;ively as eternal. By the &s;ame rule, the nature of the &s;ubject, when it is applied to beings by con&s;titution of nature immortal (as all mankind good and bad will be in the con&s;titution of &s;oul and body after the re&s;urrection) then it mu&s;t mean eternal. The happine&s;s of the one and the mi&s;ery of the other as la&s;ting as their immortality. Their own rule ap|plied to this important &s;ubject fixes and confirms our &s;en&s;e and con&s;truction of it. And the word is con&s;tantly, invariably and without exception u&s;ed to mean as la&s;ting as the con&s;titution of things to which it is applied; of cour&s;e, when it is applied to beings by nature and con&s;titution immortal, and in an eternal &s;tate, it mu&s;t mean eternal; and there is not a &s;hadow of force in their little critici&s;m. Recour&s;e to prophetic and figurative di&s;criptions which belong to other &s;ubjects, can have no effect to weaken a doctrine &s;o compleatly and deci&s;ively delivered. The meaning of &s;uch texts mu&s;t be a&s;certained by the &s;ubjects to which they relate. Nor will the univer&s;al terms u&s;ed re&s;|pecting the doctrine of &s;alvation and the great atonement, have any force to weaken the faith of this doctrine.

This doctrine &s;o illu|&s;trated and e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ugge&s;ts to us the following remarks.</P>
<P>Remark 1. The &s;upport of the authority, laws and govern|ment of God, is a matter of highe&s;t and eternal importance: and the greatne&s;s of this &s;anction in &s;upport of it, announces it to be &s;o to all the univer&s;e. This puni&s;hment carries in it a declarative te&s;timony of the immen&s;e maje&s;ty and authority of God, the great King Eternal: the infinite evil of contemning and rebelling again&s;t it, and counteracting the infinitely wi&s;e, great and good de&s;igns of his government. It announces the &s;upport of the authority, laws and government of God, to be of
<PB N="56" REF="019737_0075_0FACA44DABB502B8">
the highe&s;t importance, and that he is infinitely able and re&s;ol|ved to &s;upport it in all its dignity and glory; and to carry into full execution all the infinitely important de&s;igns of it: and when he &s;hall execute it upon all the irreconcilable enemies of his kingdom, it will be &s;een in all its importance, and there can ne|ver be a doubt of it more. It announces the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity to the faithful, and the fulfilment of all his promi&s;es to them that love and obey him: for if he executes this threatned judgment upon his enemies, which is as his &s;trange work, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly will he accompli&s;h all his works and de&s;igns of grace and love, which is his delight, in compleating the promi&s;ed &s;al|vation and eternal glory of all his friends and children that love and obey him. The &s;ufferings of the eternal Son of God, for the &s;upport and honor of the divine authority, law and govern|ment, and to open the way of mercy and &s;ecure the &s;alvation of all that believe and obey him, and the final de&s;truction of all his enemies, as a &s;acrifice in &s;upport of it, announces and demon&s;trates the importance of it with &s;tronge&s;t force conceiv|able by us, and perhaps po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things. The everla&s;ting life, from which tho&s;e that peri&s;h are eternally ex|cluded, is in it&s;elf of unutterable importance; but the glory of the divine character, and the &s;upport of his authority and go|vernment in its connections, doth &s;o infinitely &s;urpa&s;s it in dig|nity, excellency, worth and importance, that when they come in competition, it mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to it. And this great ex|hibition of it, mu&s;t inculcate godly fear and highe&s;t reverence, with deep and everla&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions, upon the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed. In&s;piration gives us their language, "&s;aying, great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who &s;hall not fear thee O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thy judgments are mani|fe&s;t." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 15.3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Rem. 2. This doctrine &s;o extended throughout the reve|lation of God, evinces it of va&s;t importance, to be taught, be|lieved and realized, for the &s;upport of the government of God and the good of mankind. Were it not of va&s;t importance to the government of God, &s;uch an infinitely terrible puni&s;hment would never have been threatned;&mdash;would never have been
<PB N="57" REF="019737_0076_0FACA44E6842FDD8">
executed upon rebel angels, and the impenitent of mankind:&mdash; and the final execution of it upon ve&s;&s;els of wrath, would never have been &s;o &s;trongly in&s;ured in the word of God. And it's being &s;o taught and exhibited in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of God to men, in a &s;tate of innocency, by in&s;truction and exemplification before the law; and much more plainly and forcibly under the law and prophets, and under the Me&s;&s;iah; evinces it's va&s;t im|portance to mankind in this world: to re&s;train from wicked|ne&s;s, to reform the vicious, to excite to faith, to repentance, and to all the purpo&s;es of godline&s;s. It &s;eems revealed as an e&s;&s;ential in the divine government, and fundamental in the &s;y&s;tem of revelation.</P>
<P>Rem. 3. This doctrine of the future puni&s;hment in con|nection with future rewards, is a full vindication of the Provi|dence of God: again&s;t all the reproaches of the ungodly and mi&s;takes of good men; in the &s;eemingly unequal di&s;pen&s;ations and di&s;tributions of this world. Particularly, in the pro&s;perity of the wicked, and frequent &s;ingular &s;ufferings of the godly.&mdash; This great my&s;tery of providence in this world, is unfolded and cleared in the doctrine of retribution in the world to come. In a &s;tate of trial and di&s;cipline, all things, mercies, afflictions, &amp;c. come alike to all. And to an&s;wer &s;ome great and good de&s;ign of Providence, the godly may &s;truggle with great adver&s;ity, per&s;ecution, &amp;c. but in the &s;tate of retribution there will be an open, vi&s;ible, everla&s;ting difference between "the precious and the vile, him that profanely &s;wears, and him that fears an oath, him that &s;erveth God and him that &s;erveth him not." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Good men ready to faint under adver&s;ity, need this &s;upport. It is given to them in 73d P&s;alm and other &s;criptures. It is a fir&s;t principle with them, "&s;ure God is good to I&s;rael, to the clean in heart:" di&s;tin|gui&s;hingly good, and will make it fully appear in this world or that to come&mdash;verily there is a reward for the righteous, great, &s;ure and eternal. But who can behold the incon&s;i&s;tent reproaches and cavils thrown out a|gain&s;t the government of God, without a mixture of pity and indignation? One &s;et of men reproach and bla&s;pheme the providence of God, becau&s;e "the tabernacles of robbers pro&s;per, and they who provoke God with hea|ven-daring crimes are &s;ecure;" and ju&s;tice doth not overtake proud, op|pre&s;&s;ing, per&s;ecuting tyrants, who trample the poor and godly under their feet; to puni&s;h them according to their de&s;erts: becau&s;e the wrongs of the oppre&s;&s;ed are not redre&s;&s;ed, nor the pious di&s;tingui&s;hingly rewarded here. Point them to the day of judgment and retributions of eternity, wherein all things will be perfectly righted. Eternity is long enough to recom|pen&s;e evil to them who do evil, and good and happine&s;s to the pious and faithful. Then, another &s;et of men cavil again&s;t an everla&s;ting difference to be made between the righteous and the wicked; and &s;ay, "it exceeds all belief." Thus, the one cavil becau&s;e perfect retribution don't take place in this world; and the other becau&s;e the mo&s;t perfect takes place in that to come. But in the great day, God's ways will be evinced to be equal and his work perfect. And in tho&s;e eternal retributions his truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s will &s;hine forth in eternal honour. And it is in part the de&s;ign of that day, to &s;top the mouth of cavillers&mdash;"to convince the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds and hard &s;peeches," and eternally clear and &s;ilence their impious cavils and reproaches. As Jude 15 v.</NOTE> This teacheth us aloud "it is not a vain thing to &s;erve the Lord, it is our life." Yea, the true and faithful &s;erving of God in this life, is evinced to be of the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible importance to us; by the greatne&s;s of the rewards and puni&s;hments of eternity.</P>

<P>Rem. 4. This doctrine, doth mo&s;t &s;trongly inforce the great, go&s;pel doctrines of regeneration, faith, repentance and holine&s;s in this world, as of utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity and importance to all. Becau&s;e there is no door of hope, to e&s;cape this tremend|ous puni&s;hment, and inherit the great &s;alvation of God, without it. It is this ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that impre&s;&s;es the&s;e doctrines and duties, as of near, home, everla&s;ting importance and con|cern to us.</P>
<P>Rem. 5. This doctrine &s;ets forth the love and &s;aving grace of God, and value of the Saviour's blood, in the highe&s;t point of importance and glory; in effecting, the &s;alvation of all that believe; the whole redeemed world. For, as is the greatne&s;s, ju&s;tice and terror of this puni&s;hment, and the greatne&s;s and glory of it's oppo&s;ite &s;alvation; &s;o, is the tran&s;cendent, excelling glory of this ineffable grace and precious blood; whereby we are delivered from the one, and put in the eternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the other.</P>
<P>Rem. 7. In this exhibition, we &s;ee all the in&s;pired men of God, who treat of this &s;ubject, do &s;et them&s;elves with one mind and &s;pirit, and with like zeal and vigor to &s;upport this doctrine of the future puni&s;hment in it's eternal terrors; to impre&s;s the belief of it; that it might have it's full power and energy on the hearts and con&s;ciences of men, for good. This they do out of piety and faithfulne&s;s to God for the &s;upport of his authority,
<PB N="59" REF="019737_0078_0FACA44FEB7A14C8">
laws and government; and with the mo&s;t &s;incere and ardent benevolence to mankind, to &s;ave them from this wrath to come and urge on their repentance and life. Here's the divine warrant for wi&s;e and good men in all ages, who have followed their example. But &s;urely, no unin&s;pired man or men can be authori&s;ed by God to a direct contrary cour&s;e and doctrine&mdash; to contradict and &s;ubvert the faith of this great doctrine&mdash;to cavil and critici&s;e the terms in which it is delivered to render it doubtful&mdash;to weaken its energy in &s;upport of the divine go|vernment in the hearts and con&s;ciences of men&mdash;and le&s;&s;en its influence to their repentance and life. If the in&s;pired men of God were right in thus &s;erving God, this counter-work can|not be of God, but of the wicked one: it was his fir&s;t and great work in the &s;eduction of mankind to &s;upplant the belief of the threatning, and thereby induce the apo&s;tacy. And it is a &s;erious, intere&s;ting que&s;tion, can men do his work without his wages? Finally, this doctrine &s;hews the infinitely alarming danger of all the impenitent going on in their &s;ins. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t them: already under condemnation to this tremendous puni&s;hment, &s;o extreme and never to have an end. O, who can think of and realize this danger as their own, without an aching heart and mo&s;t &s;olici|tous concern? What can alarm them to flee from the wrath to come, to betake them&s;elves to the go&s;pel way of e&s;cape and lay hold on the hope &s;et before them, if this will not do it? If they hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets, our Saviour and his apo&s;tles te&s;tifying this great condemnation to them, and withal opening the way of life to them in this world; neither would they be per&s;uaded though one ro&s;e from the dead, nor by any means whatever. "Wherefore awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the dead, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give thee light."</P>
<P>We pa&s;s to the &s;econd general argument: 2dly, To &s;hew the doctrine of the future puni&s;hment before &s;tated, is confirm|ed by a variety of mo&s;t pointed declarations, fitted and de&s;ign|ed of God, to cut off all pre&s;umption and hope of e&s;cape or re|&s;titution to the wicked, that die in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t addre&s;s of temptation to mankind, the grand de|ceiver de&s;igned both to &s;upplant the belief of the divine threat|ning, and implant a pre&s;umptuous hope in the human heart of
<PB N="60" REF="019737_0079_0FACA450AC777410">
life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s without complying with the terms of it ap|pointed by God in this &s;tate; and again&s;t the force of the threat|ning. And this pre&s;umptuous hope is deep rooted in the hu|man heart. It is the poi&s;onous &s;ource of innumerable tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, di&s;honours to God and mi&s;chiefs to mankind. It is this induces many to delay and put off duty and repentance; and by it they are encouraged, imboldened and hardened in iniquity to final de&s;truction. The patience and forbearance of God, the mercies of his providence, and all the adorable grace of the go&s;pel are perverted, by the fal&s;e rea&s;onings of the heart, in &s;upport of it. In&s;piration &s;hews it's de&s;tructive ope|ration many ways. "Becau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t their evil works is not executed &s;peedily, therefore the heart of the &s;ons of men is fully &s;et in them to do evil." &amp;c. &amp;c. Now, univer&s;ali&s;ts tell us, all men &s;hall finally be &s;aved, even all tho&s;e, who com|ply not with the go&s;pel terms of life in this world; all the threat|nings and cur&s;es of the book of God again&s;t it, notwith&s;tand|ing. They tell us, "we are brought into being expectants of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality, and upon a foundation that will not di&s;|appoint us."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Salvation for all men, p. 26.</NOTE> And hereby &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h this hope, as well grounded.

fatal error de&s;cribed by the &s;pirit of truth, in its principle, ope|ration and end. "He heareth the words of this cur&s;e," but a|gain&s;t all the force of it "he ble&s;&s;eth him&s;elf" with this pre|&s;umptuous hope, "that he &s;hall have peace," eternal peace; "though he walks on in the imagination and &s;tubbornne&s;s of his heart," and is encouraged, imboldened and hardened by it "to add drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t." But oh! how dreadful the end! eternally cut off from peace and happine&s;s&mdash;"all the cur&s;es of the book of God &s;hall lie upon him," without a hope of removal forever&mdash;and &s;o accur&s;ed &s;hall be &s;eperated to evil and mi&s;ery without end.

Again, what can be more pointed for the de&s;truction of this error, than tho&s;e repeated declarations of the Mo&s;t High? "There is no peace, &s;aith the Lord, unto the wicked." There is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 48.22. and I&s;aiah 57.21.</NOTE> It cannot be &s;poken of the wicked who turn from their wickedne&s;s to God, in this world; for it is abundantly declared "they &s;hall live," have mercy, pardon, peace with God in this world, and eternal peace and happine&s;s in heaven. It is &s;poken then to the wicked that die in a &s;tate of wickedne&s;s: henceforth to eternity there is no peace and happine&s;s to them. That &s;oft, deluding turn, "they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be wicked" in a future &s;tate "before they can have peace," is eva&s;ive and again&s;t the &s;pirit of the texts; which are de&s;igned to cut off all hope of &s;uch turning and peace after death; as is evident in the language of the texts and many parallel &s;criptures. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e it is writ|ten, I&s;aiah 27.11. "It is a people of no under&s;tanding; there|fore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will &s;hew them no favour."

It is diffi|cult to conceive any form of expre&s;&s;ion more pointed to the de&s;truction of this hope, and to exhibit the future puni&s;hment of the wicked ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s, than tho&s;e &s;o frequently u&s;ed.

And he teacheth us, tho&s;e who make the death of Chri&s;t vain, as to the great de|&s;igns of it in this world, &s;hall be forever cut off from the eter|nal benefits of it.

Con&s;equently they do mo&s;t deci&s;ively determine their puni&s;hment will be as la&s;ting and endle&s;s as their exi&s;tence.

If the &s;criptures are of u&s;e to us, learned and unlearned, how can we (giving attention to it) mi&s;take the truth, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch plain, practical importance.

The one teacheth, "the hope of the hypocrite and wicked, &s;hall be cut off and peri&s;h:" the other, that they are brought into being expectants of a ble&s;&s;ed immor|tality, and upon a foundation which will not di&s;appoint them.

AS AN INSTITUTION of government, it is fitted and de&s;igned by infinite wi&s;dom, to exhibit, &s;upport, illu&s;trate and exalt the character, authority and government of God in highe&s;t glory, in the &s;alvation of peri&s;hing &s;inners of mankind.

As an in&s;titution of mercy, it is de&s;igned to exhibit to us, the eternal plan of mercy in Chri&s;t, plainly and particularly, as to "the terms," "the way" and "the time;" in which, mercy and &s;alvation may be obtain|ed, by it. This, being mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and important for us to know, is made as plain, as it is important. This door of mercy and &s;alvation is now opened to the whole world, upon the &s;ame terms; but is limited to this life and &s;tate. At this clo&s;e, it is &s;hut up forever. The letter, &s;pirit, and whole frame of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, &s;hews it made for mankind in this &s;tate; and not in the future: and that mercy and &s;alvation mu&s;t be obtained in this world, or never. Herein, are &s;et forth the two grand periods of limitation as to time, when mercy may be had by us. This life to every one individually&mdash;and the end of this world, to the whole race of mankind. Then the &s;cene clo&s;eth in a &s;tate e&s;&s;entially different in re&s;pect to the admini|&s;tration of the divine government it&s;elf, and all the &s;ubjects of it. Then, this in&s;titution of mercy will operate no more, in way of mercy and relief to tho&s;e who are lo&s;t: but end, with the fini&s;hing the admini&s;tration of Chri&s;t's kingdom; who now rules, di&s;ciplines and &s;aves them that are &s;aved, by this con&s;ti|tution. Yet, this con&s;titution as an in&s;trument of government, will remain in full force&mdash;and operate mo&s;t &s;trongly, but in a
<PB N="73" REF="019737_0092_0FACA45B2DDE7268" MS="y">
way e&s;&s;entially different from what it now doth, viz. as a rule of judgment and final deci&s;ion of the &s;tates of all mankind;&mdash; and in the way of rewards and puni&s;hments, only.</P>
<P>This we apprehend to be a ju&s;t, general exhibition and view of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, in the nature, de&s;ign and operations of it, re&s;pecting mankind. A few illu&s;trations will &s;hew the ju&s;tne&s;s and confirm the truth of it. The tenor of the revela|tions of God, exhibits the following important truths in their connection, viz. This world made and earth given to the chil|dren of men, for a temporary &s;tate of re&s;idence and abode&mdash; mankind, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations introduced upon this The|atre, as being made, acting, and de&s;igned for a future and eter|nal &s;tate. The word of God, the covenant of his grace in every di&s;pen&s;ation of it; with the mini&s;try, in&s;titutions and &s;ervices of religion appointed by God: together with the whole oeco|nomy of providence in all it's di&s;pen&s;ations of light and dark|ne&s;s, mercies, judgments, trials, &amp;c. all fitted and de&s;igned in way of di&s;cipline, to form the minds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and characters of mankind for a future and eternal judgment, and an eternal &s;tate of retribution. All centering in the grand conclu&s;ion, "that this &s;tate and world, to mankind, is a &s;tate of di&s;cipline and trial, only&mdash;the next, the invi&s;ible one, a &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, only;" as contra&s;ted with the idea of di&s;ci|pline, or change of character and &s;tate. And the more clo&s;ely we attend to the tenor, &s;pirit, and complexion of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, the evidence of it, ri&s;es more clear, &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;table. For the provi&s;ion of mercy made in it, is not for the fallen angels and the di&s;obedient &s;pirits of mankind con|&s;igned with them, to the infernal pri&s;on: for verily our Saviour "took not on him the nature of angels," (to be a mediator for the fallen angels, and their a&s;&s;ociates in mi&s;ery) "but he took on him the &s;eed of Abraham;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.16.</NOTE> to be a mediator for mankind; to carry into effect the go&s;pel plan of mercy in this world. And the whole oeconomy and di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t's kingdom in this world, clearly evinces this con&s;titution made for mankind in this &s;tate, and it's &s;aving operations limited, to this world. The grand apparatus of all &s;aving means therein appointed, are for this world only; and not the future. "The
<PB N="74" REF="019737_0093_0FACA45C00B44858">
go&s;pel is the power of God to &s;alvation to every one who be|lieveth in this life, only: the mini&s;try of reconciliation is to reconcile men to God in this world, only: the ordinances of this con&s;titution are for this &s;tate, only: none will be admitted by bapti&s;m into our Lord's kingdom, in the invi&s;ible world; and the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper will be no more (the end of it being compleatly an&s;wered) when, at the end of this world, our Lord &s;hall come and fini&s;h his kingdom with infinite glory: and the di&s;cipline of his kingdom is for this &s;tate only, "that men may not be condemned with the world" in the day of judgment. Likewi&s;e the addre&s;s and invitations of mercy and offers of &s;alvation are all to men in this &s;tate, only: not a &s;ingle one extended to tho&s;e in the infernal pri&s;on.

"He that believeth in this life, &s;hall be &s;aved" in the world to come. "He that believeth not" in this life, &s;hall be damned in the world to come. The commands to believe and repent, inforced with mo&s;t glo|rious encouragements, are only to men in this world:&mdash;not a &s;ingle command or encouragement to any, in the future &s;tate. And mo&s;t of the commanded duties, tho&s;e of &s;elf-denial, chari|ty, &amp;c. are peculiar to this &s;tate. Above all, the great promi&s;es and threatnings, to inforce the terms of life and requi&s;itions of duty pre&s;cribed in this con&s;titution; are made, to things done or not done, in this life. Not a &s;ingle promi&s;e or threatning to any thing, as done or not done, in the future &s;tate. Which is a demon&s;tration, it is wholly adapted to mankind in this world, and will never operate to &s;ave any, that die in their &s;ins. When men die out of this world, they die out of this con&s;titu|tion, and can have no benefit by it, but what is connected with their tran&s;actions in this life.

the works of this life, preparatory to eternal life. Paul tells us, "after death (without change of character or &s;tate) the judg|ment."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 9.27.</NOTE> Then will all be judged and execution be done, "according to their works and the things done in the body." We before ob&s;erved, that our Lord teacheth us, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, that at death good and bad, enter into a &s;tate, not of di&s;cipline, but of retribution. And he pro|mi&s;es the penitent thief, "this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." We read "of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect," and of unimbodied "&s;pirits, of di&s;obedient mankind, in pri|&s;on." Moreover, as the whole go&s;pel con&s;titution is thus e|vidently adapted to mankind in this &s;tate; and all the means and &s;aving operations of it, thus uniformly repre&s;ented as limi|ted to this life and &s;tate: &s;o it is of importance to add&mdash;"all the promi&s;es of the Spirit of all grace (the adorable &s;anctifier of all that are and ever will be &s;aved) are made to men in this life only." All hopes of the Spirit's &s;triving with the wicked, end at death. For the Lord hath declared, "his Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man." And as a confirming te&s;timony of it to the world, he brought the flood upon the old world, and &s;hortned the life of man, Gen. 6.3. Now, if his &s;trivings with men be not limited to this life and world, and if he is ever to be given to them after death and in torment; this &s;hortening the life of man, could be no confirming evidence, "that he &s;hould not always &s;trive with man." To &s;uppo&s;e it, is to de&s;troy this public witne&s;s and te&s;timony of God. All the promi&s;es of the Spirit given us by the prophets, (and they abound with them to the church of God, for the conver&s;ion of Jews and Gentiles, &amp;c.) are evidently made, to mankind in this &s;tate, only. Was it true, that &s;o great a change was ever to be made by his grace, in the damned, as they tell of; it is incredible beyond expre&s;|&s;ion, that no promi&s;e, no notice &s;hould be given of it. He is not to be given to them, and therefore we are &s;olemnly cauti|oned "to grieve not the Spirit," accompanied with that pre&s;|&s;ing earne&s;t, "to day, after &s;o long a time; to day, if you will hear his voice, hearden not your hearts."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 4.7.</NOTE> In the day of judg|ment we are told, the wicked "&s;hall be puni&s;hed with an ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord;" but where

<P>It is very clear in this con&s;titution, that all who are now heirs and &s;hall finally po&s;&s;e&s;s the great &s;alvation "are new creatures, created in Chri&s;t to good works" by the grace of this divine Spirit. "They are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed, ju&s;tified, &s;anctified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God." But all hopes of &s;alvation, to them (that die in their &s;ins) by the &s;acrifice and Spirit of Chri&s;t, is intirely cut off, by that declaration of Paul, Gal. 3.13, 14. "That he was made a cur&s;e, that we might receive the promi&s;e of the Spirit, through faith." It is obvious from this text, that the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t is not de&s;igned, nor will operate to the &s;alvation of any, but tho&s;e who receive the promi&s;e and gift of the Spirit:&mdash;and it is equally obvious, that the faith, by which we receive the promi&s;e, is a grace in this life:&mdash;and a-like evident, that the purpo&s;e for which the pro|mi&s;e is made and the Spirit is given, "is &s;anctification and holine&s;s in this life."

doctrine of very great practical importance, &s;o our Lord hath taken care abundantly to confirm it, in a variety of parables.

For when he comes to judgment "his rewards are with him;" not to give all men &s;alvation, nor to con&s;ign a part of mankind to another temporary &s;tate of di&s;cipline; and &s;o leave the great affairs of his kingdom, un&s;ettled: no, but to &s;ettle them effec|tually, and unalterably, "by rendering to every man according to his works, and the deeds done in the body." For he re|peatedly a&s;&s;ures us, "he will call all to an account:" that he will &s;eparate "the good from the bad, the wicked from the ju&s;t:" that the good and faithful, &s;hall receive his divine ap|probation with ineffable rewards: but &s;lothful, unfaithful &s;er|vants, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of iniquity, "&s;hall be ca&s;t out of his kingdom," from all the means and grace of it; "ca&s;t out of his kingdom into outer darkne&s;s," as contra&s;ted with all the glorious light and grace which now &s;hines in his pre&s;ent ad|mini&s;tration; "&s;hall be ca&s;t out into a &s;tate of weeping, wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth:" and that his &s;olemn deci&s;ions in that day, &s;hall be forthwith put in execution, and terminate in this mo&s;t important i&s;&s;ue, viz.

And our Saviour in his parables, in conjunction with the whole current of &s;crip|ture, deci&s;ively teaches the contrary. I would al&s;o &s;ubjoin the Dr's wit|ne&s;s again&s;t it. In his &s;ermons, "Breaking bread a go&s;pel in&s;titution," p. 47. he tells us, There is no other "coming of Chri&s;t" &s;poken of in &s;cripture, but his "coming at the end of the world, in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels," when a period will be put to the admini|&s;tration of God's kingdom in its pre&s;ent form." And p. 48. he will not come until the "my&s;tery of God is fini&s;hed, and time &s;hall be no more." On which I ob&s;erve, "the coming of Chri&s;t" mentioned 1 Cor. 15.23, is his coming to judgment, for there is none other &s;poken of in &s;cripture. Then the Dr. &s;aith, "a period will be put to the admini&s;tration of the kingdom of God in its pre&s;ent form." Now we read of no other change in admini&s;tration, but that de&s;cribed v. 28. "the Son him&s;elf &s;ubject, and God all in all." Surely, this change will not take place, till the Son hath compleated his whole work with which he is intru&s;ted to bring into effect. In this the Dr. is expre&s;s, "he will not come until the my&s;tery of God is fini&s;hed:" and when this is fini&s;hed, &s;urely there can be no great deal, nor any thing more to be done; nor any long period requi&s;ite for &s;uch a purpo&s;e: nor can there be any next &s;tate, as temporary, after the judgment: for the Dr. is expre&s;s, "time &s;hall be no more." And in page 37, he repre&s;ents tho&s;e who are not awakened to life in this world, as "undone for the future world;" if "undone for the future world," they cannot have everla&s;ting life in it.</NOTE> This illu&s;tration and confirmation of the general exhibit given of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, &s;eems fully deci&s;ive. Since the te|nor of revelation, the letter, &s;pirit, and whole frame of the go&s;|pel con&s;titution, exhibits it to the world made for mankind in this world and not in the future&mdash;and all the &s;aving means, grace and operations of it in recovering &s;ubjects of mercy to eternal life, are limited to this life and world. Will all men be &s;aved at the day of judgment? No, the con&s;titution an|nounces and a&s;&s;ures us, in that day, all the wicked will be con|&s;igned by &s;entence and execution to an everla&s;ting puni&s;hment in righteous retribution, "for the things done in the body." And further, that all hope of end, or re&s;titution from that &s;tate of puni&s;hment, is eternally cut off; becau&s;e the admini&s;tration of the kingdom of mercy comes to an everla&s;ting end with the deci&s;ions of that day.

Thus cut off and ca&s;t out of the kingdom, their mi&s;ery mu&s;t be as la&s;ting and endle&s;s as their immortality; by the force of that con&s;titution "which all along has been, now is, and always will be the only way of life for &s;inful man."

<P>Reflection 3. How inexcu&s;able are the neglectors of this great &s;alvation? &s;ince the God of love, in the go&s;pel con&s;titu|tion, hath publi&s;hed to the world his adorable plan of mercy and &s;alvation for peri&s;hing mankind; and hath opened the door to all upon the &s;ame gracious terms. And addre&s;&s;es our ingenu|ity and all the tender feelings of our hearts, with his infinite benevolence in gift and de&s;ign. "God &s;o loved the world as to give his only begotten &s;on"&mdash;this is the un&s;peakable gift&mdash; "that who&s;oever believeth in him" of all ages, nations and ge|nerations, "&s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life:" this is his all-important de&s;ign. Since he hath &s;et him at the head of this glorious kingdom of mercy, to compleat the &s;al|vation of all that believe in him. And under his reign, ad|dre&s;&s;eth us with the univer&s;al offer of it&mdash;who&s;oever will may come&mdash;and "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved." And hath put it upon the lowe&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, which can con&s;i&s;t with the ho|nour of his adorable authority, maje&s;ty and government. "Be|lieve and thou &s;halt be &s;aved;" "repent, turn and live." And God hath graciou&s;ly furni&s;hed us with all de&s;irable &s;aving means, accompanied with an abundant encouragement of all-&s;uffici|ent grace in the due u&s;e of them. And to induce and inforce our compliance with the terms of life, he not only addre&s;&s;es to our ingenuity and tender feeling, which are but feeble &s;prings of action in degenerate minds; but al&s;o to our hopes and fears, the mo&s;t powerful &s;prings of action in our natures. And to the&s;e he addre&s;&s;es the highe&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t motives in nature and eternity. With the hope "of eternal life," and fear "of ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment." "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." Surely if we are found among the neglectors of &s;o great &s;alvation, and peri&s;h from un|der a con&s;titution which &s;o exalts us, as to heaven, of all men we mu&s;t be among the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. For how ju&s;t, how nece&s;&s;ary by con&s;titution, and how aggravated &s;uch a damnation? If "he that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es law, died without mercy, under two or three witne&s;&s;es," "of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of

<P>Reflection 4. The immutability and eternal duration of this divine con&s;titution, doth indeed carry in it eternal terrors to &s;inners who go on in their &s;ins to perdition; but withal brings to them the highe&s;t encouragements in this life to "turn and live." The in&s;truction is, believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with a living, obediential faith, and this great &s;alvation is a&s;&s;uredly yours. The importunate language of it is, "to day, while it is called to day, hearken to his his gracious voice"&mdash; comply with his gracious terms, that you may e&s;cape the terri|ble de&s;truction of the threatning, and inherit the un&s;peakable good and glory of the promi&s;es. Finally, this divine con&s;ti|tution addre&s;&s;es to believers, to all the faithful in the family of God, the language of &s;tronge&s;t encouragement, &s;upport and con&s;olation in running the chri&s;tian race, and maintaining the chri&s;tian warfare faithful to the end. In this way their victory and triumph, their &s;alvation and glory, will be &s;ure and everla&s;ting. For this purpo&s;e the eternal plan of mer|cy was concerted and is publi&s;hed to the world in this con&s;ti|tution, "he that hath begun will fini&s;h his good work" in infinite perfection and glory. Their Redeemer is Almighty &mdash;he is at the head of this kingdom of mercy&mdash;he hath open|ed the way and e&s;tabli&s;hed the foundation and eternal &s;ecuri|ties of it in his own great &s;acrifice&mdash;he hath all power in hea|ven and earth&mdash;power all-&s;ufficient to &s;ubdue his enemies and compleat the &s;alvation of his people; and he will reign till he hath compleated his work, and the "my&s;tery of God is fini&s;h|ed." He will never give up the kingdom till he comes in his glory, to take vengeance on his enemies, and puni&s;h them with everla&s;ting de&s;truction and compleat the &s;alvation of all that are his: to be eternally "admired and glorified in all that believe." What an addre&s;s of encouragement, &s;upport, and comfort this to all true mourners in Zion, to all the feeble and faint-hearted in the flock of God, in all their afflictions, trials and conflicts? they &s;hall return to the heavenly Zion, with everla&s;ting joys and &s;ongs of &s;alvation. We now pro|ceed to con&s;ider &s;everal particulars of this divine con&s;titution,

which all con&s;pire with united force to a deci&s;ion of this contro|ver&s;y. As fir&s;t, the e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary terms of life and &s;alvation &s;et forth in the go&s;pel con&s;titution and proclamation, cut off all hope and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to tho&s;e that die in their &s;ins. For by this con&s;titution, &s;alvation depends on cer|tain terms as embraced or rejected by &s;inful men, in this life. I &s;hall illu&s;trate it in the article of go&s;pel faith only: this is made ab&s;olutely and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in this life to &s;alvati|on. There is no declaration or promi&s;e of God to be a ground of faith, nor command to believe, nor promi&s;e or encourage|ment to induce faith, nor grace to effect it with divine power to any, beyond the grace. And yet faith is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, "that no man can be in a &s;tate of acceptance with God, till he is a be|liever;" and "men's being believers or unbelievers is the grand di&s;tinction the &s;cripture makes between them," and "&s;o intere&s;ting that &s;alvation or damnation depends upon it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Dr's note, Sermons p. 175.</NOTE> The indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of faith to &s;alvation, is &s;et forth many ways&mdash;by con&s;titution, &s;alvation turns upon it. "He that believeth is pa&s;&s;ed from death to life," "hath everla&s;ting life," and "he that hath the Son hath life," and "he that hath not the Son hath not life," "&s;hall not &s;ee life." By con&s;titution, it holds an immediate, in&s;eparable connection with it: by command, "believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved:" by promi&s;e, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved:" by declaration, "the go&s;pel is the power of God to &s;alvation to every one that believeth," Jew or Gentile&mdash; "we are &s;aved through faith" and believers receive actual "&s;alvation as the end of their faith."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1.9.</NOTE> Hereby tho&s;e who die in unbelief are evidently cut off from &s;alvation.

of &s;in and title to life; but is under condemnation and wrath. And ju&s;tification and glorification are in&s;eparably connected together, Rom. 8.30. and it is mo&s;t evident in this divine con&s;titution, that faith is the appointed medium "of our ju&s;tification to eternal life, and is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to it. Paul teaches it abundantly in his epi&s;tles to the Romans, Galatians, &amp;c. "that the ju&s;t do live by faith," "that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto all and upon all that believe," (unto ju&s;tification and life) and "there is no difference." They "being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s," "that he might be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of every one who believeth in Je&s;us." And in|troduces believing Abraham as an example of ju&s;tification by faith, as a pattern (in the terms and method of &s;alvation) of all true believers, and the father of the faithful, that &s;hall ever be &s;aved. And draws his conclu&s;ion once and again, "therefore we conclude a man is ju&s;tified by faith," "therefore being ju&s;|tified by faith," &amp;c. And declares, "Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth." Rom. 10.4. So that "grace, Chri&s;t and faith are all nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tification of life, and the latter as truly as the former, tho' in a different view."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Sermons, p. 162, at the bottom.

Their con&s;truction is, that ju&s;tification of life is "to &s;inners in common," the gift of it is to "all men, believers and un|believers." The Dr. re&s;tricts it to the &s;ubjects "of faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Their con&s;truction mu&s;t be fal&s;e, for it makes the apo&s;tle directly to con|tradict and overthrow the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, which he la|bours with &s;uch pains and force of argument to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm in this epi&s;tle and el&s;ewhere: for if ju&s;tification of life is come upon all unbe|lievers, it certainly is not come to them through faith.

nece&s;&s;ary to their ju&s;tification and life; the con&s;equence is clear, by this con&s;titution they are and will be con&s;igned to eternal condemnation and wrath. It is evident likewi&s;e, that none but the children of God, by regeneration and adoption, will ever inherit his eternal kingdom. The apo&s;tle &s;ets forth this con|nection, "if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.17.</NOTE> And by this heir&s;hip we ri&s;e to the heavenly inheritance.

And the faith that &s;aves and by which "the ju&s;t do live," is every where in &s;cripture di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, by its &s;anctifying operations and fruits.

<P>We add, no one can be &s;aved by all the provi&s;ion, grace and mercy in the go&s;pel proclamation in any way, but in com|pliance with the terms of life &s;et forth in it. It is of the nature of all proclamations of mercy both of God and man, "to ex|hibit the plan and method of mercy, to di&s;criminate the &s;ub|jects of mercy, and to a&s;certain, limit and bound it by the terms of mercy &s;et forth in them." There is one con&s;tructi|on to both, viz. "the terms of mercy and life &s;et forth," "are a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of them." All hope beyond this is ab|&s;olute pre&s;umption, is unrea&s;onable, un&s;criptural, and again&s;t the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. And the terms of life and &s;al|vation in the go&s;pel proclamation, are &s;o e&s;&s;ential they mu&s;t be &s;upported in all their nece&s;&s;ity and importance to an&s;wer the great de&s;igns of it, to &s;upport the authority and govern|ment of God, do honour to it, and to inforce compliance with the terms and requi&s;itions of it, &s;ubjection and obedience: all hope of it without is vain. And this affords an ea&s;y, conclu&s;ive an&s;wer to all their arguments drawn from the terms of "uni|ver&s;ality" found in the go&s;pel proclamation. It is freely al|lowed, terms of "univer&s;ality" are u&s;ed re&s;pecting the great atonement. "Chri&s;t is the Lamb of God, which taketh
<PB N="87" REF="019737_0106_0FACA3DC6A052808" MS="y">
away the &s;ins of the world;" "he hath made propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world;" hath ta&s;ted death for every man;" i.e. that every man, Jew or Gentile, may be &s;aved upon the &s;ame terms of life: but no one in any other way. The adorable grace of God is &s;et forth in terms of "univer&s;ality," by the angel; "I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all peo|ple" &mdash;"peace on earth, good will towards man:" denoting it is of univer&s;al, infinite importance to all&mdash;a door is opened that they may be &s;aved on the &s;ame terms. Again, "God wills all men to be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of the truth" as the means to it. Not only wills it, but enjoins it by all his dread authority, "commanding all men every where to repent for remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." Yea, enjoins it on all upon peril of damnation: "He that believeth not &s;hall be damn|ed." Now, in that part of the proclamation which exhibits the benevolence and love of God in its highe&s;t glory, "in gift and de&s;ign," this matter is clearly "a&s;certained." Our Lord tells us, John 3.16, "God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotton Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting life." Here the plan of mer|cy is exhibited clearly and in full to us, in the adorable &s;pring and &s;urce of it, the love of God "in the way of its exerci&s;e," in the gift of his only begotten Son," the &s;ubjects of mercy are di&s;criminated, and the extent of mercy expre&s;sly limited by terms, to "who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." Is this declaration upon the plan of the univer&s;al &s;alvation of all men, or of tho&s;e only "who believe?" Did not our Lord under&s;tand the plan of mercy, he came to publi&s;h and carry into execution? Doth he nor give it to us, mo&s;t truly and faithfully? Surely. Then, there is no room for a moment's he&s;itation, his declaration is deci&s;ive "all that believe &s;hall be &s;aved," the re&s;t &s;hall peri&s;h, as excluded, by the terms of &s;alvation &s;et forth in the proclamation, which de|&s;ignedly de&s;criminate "the &s;ubjects of mercy and life." The univer&s;ali&s;ts argue the atonement, grace and mercy are &s;et forth in univer&s;al terms, and in this partial view of the &s;ubject, infer &mdash;therefore "all men &s;hall eventually be &s;aved." The con|clu&s;ion is fal&s;e. And the error of it is manife&s;t; becau&s;e, in
<PB N="88" REF="019737_0107_0FACA3DD2F9EEEE8">
this way, the terms of life and &s;alvation &s;et up in the con&s;titu|tion and proclamation, which make "a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of it," are excluded; and the conclu&s;ion drawn, not only with|out them, but in direct oppo&s;ition to them. Whereas all the e&s;&s;ential parts of the proclamation, with its de&s;ign, mu&s;t be taken together to form a right conclu&s;ion: and then it will be directly contrary to theirs, viz. that all tho&s;e who "believe" and comply with the terms of life, and tho&s;e only, "&s;hall be &s;aved." To the deci&s;ion of this important que&s;tion, who of mankind &s;hall finally be &s;aved? the general terms of grace and mercy mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be limited in their con&s;truction, by "the particular terms of life and &s;alvation" which "di&s;cri|minate the &s;ubjects of it;" otherwi&s;e we introduce an irrecon|cilable oppo&s;ition and contradiction between them: making the terms of life nece&s;&s;ary as they are by con&s;titution, and un|nece&s;&s;ary, as final unbelievers will be &s;aved without them: which is ab&s;urd. Their con&s;truction exhibits the wi&s;dom of God which hath appointed the&s;e terms of life&mdash;the grace of God which hath given them to peri&s;hing &s;inners&mdash;and the au|thority of God which hath enjoined them with the highe&s;t &s;anc|tions, of &s;alvation and damnation, to be incon&s;i&s;tent in exer|ci&s;e, operation and effect, in the &s;ame plan and con&s;titution of mercy: in making the&s;e e&s;&s;ential terms both nece&s;&s;ary and unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;aving &s;ome with and others without them: which is gro&s;sly ab&s;urd and impious.</P>
<P>Moreover, their con&s;truction totally defeats the important de&s;igns to be an&s;wered by the go&s;pel terms of life. The way of &s;alvation by faith is fitted and de&s;igned to an&s;wer the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es in the government of God. For the wi&s;|dom of God hath appointed faith the medium of our union to Chri&s;t, and intere&s;t in all the eternal benefits of his redemp|tion, to di&s;play the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, "as ju&s;t and yet the ju&s;tifier of every one who believeth in Je&s;us"&mdash;"to illu&s;trate the riches and glory of his grace" in this way of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation&mdash;to do infinite honour to the atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t"&mdash;"to cut off all boa&s;ting and glory|ing in the creature"&mdash;"to illu&s;trate the truth, certainty and glo|ry of the promi&s;es made to faith"&mdash;and to reduce and &s;ubject us by faith to the authority and government of God, by means
<PB N="89" REF="019737_0108_0FACA3DDE6DAF1F8">
of which it is re&s;tored in the hearts of his willing and obedient people to the prai&s;e of his grace." In a word, it is for the ho|nour and &s;upport of the authority and government of God and glory of his kingdom, in an in&s;eparable connection with the highe&s;t good of the faithful, the heirs of faith "in their ju&s;tifi|cation, adoption, &s;anctification and final glorification." De|&s;igns the&s;e of &s;uch magnitude, glory, and importance as are undoubtedly infinitely too great to be &s;acrificed to make way for the &s;alvation of the unbelieving and di&s;obedient. Where|fore, we conclude no man can be ju&s;tified and &s;aved but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: &s;o that "as no provi&s;ion of mercy is made for &s;inners continuing &s;uch," final unbelievers mu&s;t ine|vitably peri&s;h for ever, all the provi&s;ion, grace and mercy of the go&s;pel proclamation notwith&s;tanding. So our Lord hath taught us to conceive of this &s;ubject, to argue and draw our conclu&s;ion, in the parable of the &s;upper, Luke 14.16 to 25. The provi&s;ion is full and abundant, the invitation is univer&s;al, but tho&s;e who do not in this life come in upon the invitation and offer, "&s;hall none of them ever ta&s;te of his &s;upper." v. 24. Other arguments might be adduced in proof "that the general terms mu&s;t be limited in con&s;truction, by "the particular terms of life and &s;alvation held forth in the go&s;pel; but it is needle&s;s, for common &s;en&s;e teacheth it: (e.g.) Should any of the &s;overeignties of the earth, i&s;&s;ue a proclamation to their &s;ubjects in rebellion, couched in never &s;o &s;trong, general and univer&s;al terms of grace and benevolence, inforced with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of pardon and re&s;toration to tho&s;e "who would lay down their arms, &s;wear allegiance, &s;ubmit to govern|ment, and become good &s;ubjects, &amp;c." and &s;hould any one take it into his head upon this, to run and preach "glad tidings of great joy"&mdash;"all the rebels in the dominion &s;hall be pardoned, re&s;tored, one as well as another," and alledge in proof of it, "the proclamation exhibiting the plan of mercy is full, the terms are univer&s;al, and it is the very glory of the proclamation that tho&s;e who do not comply with the terms of mercy and pardon held forth in it, nor an&s;wer the de&s;ign of it, &s;hall be finally pardoned and re&s;tored as well as tho&s;e who do; would not every man of common &s;en&s;e, judge &s;uch an one delirious, or void of common &s;en&s;e?

&s;uch general and univer&s;al terms made u&s;e of to &s;et forth the provi&s;ion and grace of the go&s;pel, "if believers only &s;hall be &s;aved? Since &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e they are de&s;igned to teach us "all men &s;hall eventually be &s;aved," and will admit of no other rational con&s;truction.

How could the great de&s;igns of divine government and mercy be carried into execution without them? No one is in&s;erted by name, nor would &s;uch an in&s;ertion an&s;wer the de&s;igns of government in a &s;tate of trial.

Again, how could any one (not named) be warranted to hope and tru&s;t in it upon the terms of life, unle&s;s it was exhibited as all-&s;ufficient and free to all upon the &s;ame terms? The terms, of|fers and commands mu&s;t be univer&s;al, that all might read their concern in it, and to open a door of hope and &s;alvation to all nations and characters of mankind without di&s;tinction or ex|ception of any, on the &s;ame terms, and that the believing of all nations might be &s;aved, and to &s;ubject the unbelieving and di&s;obedient to the blame and righteous condemnation which awaits them. This is undoubtedly the de&s;ign of them. This vindicates the wi&s;dom, u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of them, though they are neither de&s;igned nor fitted in any ju&s;t con&s;truction of them, in the lea&s;t to encourage any hope of &s;alvation but in com|pliance with the terms of life held forth to us. Herein we have a clear con&s;i&s;tency between the general and particular terms&mdash;a perfect harmony in their nature, de&s;ign and u&s;e. The great object of our Saviour's mini&s;try and that of his apo&s;|tles, was evidently to &s;et forth the provi&s;ion of &s;alvation made for &s;inful men, the importance of it, the terms on which it might be had, and to urge compliance with the&s;e terms as the only way in which any would be finally &s;aved. And nothing more di&s;tant from them, than to teach contempt of the&s;e terms as di&s;pen&s;ible, and what would in fact be di&s;pen&s;ed with to the final neglectors and di&s;obedient, again&s;t which their admoni|tions and warnings are mo&s;t pointed. As to the numbers of mankind who &s;hould finally and eventually be &s;aved, it ap|pears not to have been the object of their attention; certain|ly

not of their deci&s;ion. They re&s;t it on this general i&s;&s;ue: an "innumerable multitude out of all nations &s;hall be &s;aved:" as 7th chapter of Revelations, all the believing and obe|dient &s;hall be &s;aved, but all the di&s;obedient "&s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction." And this ought to be deci&s;ive. Hitherto we have argued all hope and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, is cut off by the nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential terms of life held forth in the go&s;pel con&s;titution and proclamation; in which go&s;pel faith is made &s;o ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to it, that "&s;alvation or damnation turns upon it:" "it is e&s;&s;entially and immediately connected with it many ways;" and e&s;&s;entially connected with other pre-requi&s;ites which are made indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation." In a word, &s;o that without it, no one can be &s;aved by all the pro|vi&s;ion, mercy and grace of this divine proclamation, in the true, ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;truction of it. It is this unfolds "the plan of mercy," "di&s;criminates the &s;ubjects of mercy," "and limits the mercy to tho&s;e who comply with the terms of life herein &s;et forth." All hope beyond is ab&s;urd, fatal pre|&s;umption. In this way we &s;ee all hopes are entirely cut off to final unbelievers, without con&s;idering the damnatory clau&s;es annexed to inforce the terms. But the&s;e are annexed, yea, are an e&s;&s;ential of this divine con&s;titution and proclamation, and do more &s;trongly confirm the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. For it is as true, "he that believeth not &s;hall be damned," as "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved," and the&s;e are oppo&s;ite the one to the other: &s;o that he who is a &s;ubject of the cur&s;e cannot be of the ble&s;&s;ing. This is of &s;uch great weight as de&s;erves a di&s;|tinct di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Wherefore we ob&s;erve, &s;econdly, the wick|ed that die in their &s;ins, are by go&s;pel con&s;titution all pro&s;cri|bed and forever excluded the kingdom of God and eternal life, and con&s;igned to a puni&s;hment which excludes all hope and po&s;&s;ibility of it.

We have it from the highe&s;t authority, the Saviour him|&s;elf, John 3.36, "He that believeth on the Son hath ever|la&s;ting life;" "and he that believeth not &s;hall not &s;ee life (i.e. &s;hall not enjoy everla&s;ting life) but the wrath of God abideth on him." Paul announces it in a manner of addre&s;s that im|ports it one of the mo&s;t plain, &s;ure and important truths of the go&s;pel, which he pre&s;umed no chri&s;tian could be ignorant of and no one would deny. 1 Cor. 6.10, 11. "Know ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ays he, (i.e. by the plain doctrine and con&s;titution of the go&s;|pel) that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God?" and to put it forever out of all doubt adds, "be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind, nor thieves, nor cove|tous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God:" intending, no doubt, tho&s;e who&s;e charac|ters the&s;e are at death &amp; the final judgment. It was his con&s;tant doctrine, of which he reminds the Galatians; concluding his annumeration of the works of the fle&s;h thus, "of the which I tell you before, as I have al&s;o told you in time pa&s;t, that they which do &s;uch things &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5.21. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e are Ephe&s;. 5.5. Rev. 21.8. and by an unalterable &s;tatute of this con&s;titution, it is written, Heb. 12.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4. "without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." And by many po&s;itive declarations before cited, which need not be repeated, the wicked are con&s;igned to the damnation of hell. There is no con&s;titution in the world where &s;tatutes of pro&s;cription to traitors and enemies are more plain, and &s;o in-wro't in the con&s;titution, as tho&s;e in the go&s;pel again&s;t the fi|nally di&s;obedient. Now every one knows the force and ope|ration of &s;tatutes of pro&s;cription, viz. that the ju&s;tly pro&s;cribed cannot inherit with the good and faithful &s;ubjects in the &s;tate and kingdom where pro&s;cribed, while the &s;tatutes remain in force. They do not in&s;titute a &s;uit in courts of law and ju&s;|tice being &s;ure of condemnation in them. They apply (if ap|plication for relief be made) to the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, for a repeal of &s;tatute, or to be &s;uper&s;eded by an act of grace, as their only hope. Vain therefore are the hopes of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins: for the&s;e go&s;pel &s;tatutes and declarations can never be &s;uper&s;eded or vacated. They are in-wrought in the
<PB N="93" REF="019737_0112_0FACA3E1A857C240">
divine con&s;titution as an e&s;&s;ential part of it. As an in&s;trument of government, they are as important as the privileges of it; and they are as unalterable and la&s;ting as the promi&s;es of it. The promi&s;es and threatnings con&s;titute the wi&s;dom, &s;trength and glory of the con&s;titution&mdash;both are given with the &s;ame merciful de&s;ign, to inforce the terms and requi&s;itions of it: both are from the &s;ame authority; and both have the &s;ame founda|tion of &s;upport, viz. the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, truth and immutability of God. All the hopes and &s;ecurity of the righ|teous, as well as fears of the wicked, are dependent on it. The whole mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed or peri&s;h forever. Our opponants imagine it may be partly maintained and partly &s;uper&s;eded,&mdash; but this is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature and foundation of it, and is incon&s;i&s;tent with all idea of divine wi&s;dom and perfection. They maintain in &s;ome future period, at or after the day of judgment, the condemning &s;tatutes and threatnings will be &s;u|per&s;eded and vacated, and an univer&s;al re&s;toration take place; then the con&s;titution is de&s;troyed, and all the &s;ecurities of it, peri&s;h with it. And in&s;tead of the &s;alvation of all men, it terminates in this mo&s;t &s;hocking of all conclu&s;ions, viz. an utter uncertainty whether any &s;on or daughter of mankind &s;hall ever inherit eternal life. So infinitely pernicious and de&s;tructive is this horrid error; but we are a&s;&s;ured this "word of the Lord will endure forever"&mdash;"that not a jot or tittle of it &s;hall fail, but all &s;hall be fulfilled." And we are plainly told, the ope|ration of the&s;e excluding &s;tatutes in the day of judgment and throughout eternity, Rev. 20.11. to the end. It is written, viz. "and I &s;aw the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of tho&s;e things which are written in the books, according to their works." By "the book of life" we may under&s;tand "the book of divine revelation" which de&s;cribes the characters of tho&s;e who &s;hall inherit eternal life; and in tho&s;e characters "their names are as in&s;erted and regi&s;tered, for life. And all who&s;e names are not thus found written, are pro&s;cribed to future condemna|tion and puni&s;hment, as v. 15. "and who&s;oever was not found written in the book of life, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire." And in v. 10. their puni&s;hment is de&s;cribed as "never-cea&s;ing and
<PB N="94" REF="019737_0113_0FACA3E26A122828">
never-ending;" "and &s;hall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." This we have &s;hewn is "the imported puni&s;h|ment in every de&s;cription of it;" and that it is repeatedly "a&s;|&s;erted to be everla&s;ting" in words and phra&s;es emphatically expre&s;&s;ive of "eternity, and by figures the mo&s;t emphatical&mdash; "by fire unquenchable" "a fire that &s;hall never be quenched" and "a worm that dieth not." If the figure be dropped and we attend to the meaning, if this doth not mean "a puni&s;hment that &s;hall never have an end" it can mean nothing, or &s;omething directly contrary to the natural and &s;trong purport of it; which is ab&s;urd and impious. And it is confirmed, by examples of de&s;truction in which all hope of deliverance and re&s;titution is barred by an impo&s;&s;ibility natural, or moral, or both. Thus St. Peter teacheth us, "the old world peri&s;hed,"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 3.6.</NOTE> with its in|habitants: con&s;equently, Noah and his family came as to a new world after the flood. Which makes it naturally impo&s;|&s;ible that tho&s;e who &s;o peri&s;hed, &s;hould ever be re&s;tored again to the &s;ame &s;tate as before, with Noah. God had &s;worn the unbelieving I&s;raelites &s;hould not enter into his re&s;t; and they were de&s;troyed in pur&s;uance of his oath: which oath, made the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this re&s;t, morally impo&s;&s;ible to them. Sodom and Ghomorrha are uninhabitable, which renders their re&s;titu|tion naturally impo&s;&s;ible; and they were de&s;igned of God to be en&s;amples of perpetual de&s;truction, in this world and the world to come, and are &s;o improved by the prophets and apo&s;|tles; which renders their re&s;titution likewi&s;e, morally impo&s;&s;i|ble. And the&s;e examples are as fatal to their doctrine of di&s;|cipline, as re&s;titution. For if the future puni&s;hment, be by way of di&s;cipline, why are the&s;e en&s;amples cho&s;en, who all peri&s;hed in di&s;pen&s;ations of vindictive wrath only, without mercy&mdash;not for any good to them that peri&s;hed, but for the honour of the authority, ju&s;tice and government of God; and by way of admonition, for the good of others in this world? why are they cho&s;en, in preference of the many &s;cripture ex|amples, where di&s;cipline and re&s;titution were evidently de&s;ign|ed; while the&s;e examples carry no &s;uch language in them, but deci&s;ively that of vindictive wrath and perpetual de&s;olation? wherefore cho&s;en, but according to their natural import, to
<PB N="95" REF="019737_0114_0FACA3E32E336C50">
teach "the future puni&s;hment to be a retribution of wrath only, and &s;o in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e "to be examples of eternal fire" and puni&s;hment, as Jude 7th? Which excludes all hope and po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;alvation to them that peri&s;h. Moreover, our Lord, in the parable of Dives and Lazarus teaches the future &s;tate of the wicked as well as righteous, to be fixed and unalterable. "There is no pa&s;&s;ing from the one to the other." He al&s;o confirms it in his &s;entence upon Judas, "it had been good for that man, if he had not been born;"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 26.24.</NOTE> for it is evident this cannot be true of him, if he &s;hall ever enjoy eternal life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Again&s;t this deci&s;ive &s;entence &s;ome have argued, Judas &s;hall have eter|nal life, from Mat. 19.28.

But it is forgotten, that the promi&s;e is made and limited to them which followed Chri&s;t "in the regene|ration," to which Judas hath no claim, and that he "fell from his apo&s;tle|&s;hip," after which he was not intitled to the lea&s;t benefit by it; and much le&s;s to one of &s;uch tran&s;cendent importance:&mdash;and that in fact, at death he went not to heaven&mdash;but "to his own place" "perdition," of which Chri&s;t pronounced him "the &s;on" or heir&mdash;and that Matthias was cho&s;en to the apo&s;tle&s;hip in his room, Acts 1.25, 26.</NOTE> He likewi&s;e confirms it, in his &s;entence upon tho&s;e who &s;in and bla&s;pheme again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t. It is a&s;&s;erted in mo&s;t per|emptory terms, "it &s;hall not be forgiven," Luke 12.10. "hath never forgivene&s;s," Mark 3.29. "&s;hall not be forgiven unto men," no, "it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It is to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay, "by this world and world to come" is in|tended the Mo&s;aic and Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation. For this con&s;truction is in it&s;elf without foundation; and if admitted, avails nothing. Becau&s;e, "there is none other name under heaven whereby we can be &s;aved, but the name of Je&s;us: and it is under his di&s;pen&s;ation, he &s;aves all that ever will be &s;aved. For it is a contradiction to &s;ay, he will &s;ave any, after his di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy and life is ended: as truly as to &s;ay, he will &s;ave men after he hath done &s;aving them. Their own con&s;truction teaches, they can't have pardon and &s;alvation, while his di&s;pen&s;ation la&s;ts, which cuts off all po&s;&s;ibility of it for|ever. For after that there is no &s;alvation by his or any other name. So their little critici&s;m has not the weight of a feather, again&s;t a declaration in &s;uch plain, po&s;itive, deci&s;ive terms as will admit of no eva&s;ion, but what amounts to a denial of the letter, &s;pirit and evident meaning of them.</NOTE> Mat. 12.30, 31.

nor the future, all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation is cut off forever. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a word, it is abundantly confirmed by the ground and rule by which they are excluded and condemned, "for things done in the body in this life." This ground and rule is the only one known in this con&s;titution&mdash;it is the &s;ame to the good and the evil, "the ju&s;t and unju&s;t," "they &s;hall all be judged according to their works, good or evil, and "all receive according to the things done in the body." And as this ground and rule is un|alterable, &s;o the exclu&s;ion and condemnation of the wicked by it mu&s;t remain to eternity. As clearly and &s;urely as the ju&s;tification and inheritance adjudged to the righteous &s;hall remain to eternity. It admits no alteration in the character and &s;tate of the righteous or wicked, after this life, and the &s;entence and execution of the great day. We have the expre&s;s deci&s;ive language of it, Rev. 22.11. "He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till: he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous &s;till: and he that is holy let him be holy &s;till. Which evidently cuts off all hope and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to all the condemned in that great day.</P>
<P>A third particular, which &s;trongly confirms this doctrine is, "the great objective de&s;ign of the plan and con&s;titution of mer|cy to mankind in this world, viz. to reconcile &s;inful men to God, to recover them to cordial &s;ubjection in Chri&s;t; to the life of God, to the practice of holine&s;s and a meetne&s;s for heaven in this life; and in this way to bring them to the enjoyment of the great &s;alvation." This is &s;o evident, that he who runs may read it the great object of this divine con&s;titution. The word and mi|ni&s;try of reconciliation, the appointed means of &s;alvation, with the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Spirit of grace, are all to this great end. And "the ordinary way in which God gives his Spirit, to effect a work of grace in the hearts of &s;inners, is in the u&s;e of appointed means. Nor is there ground of hope, in the revelations of God, to be &s;aved any other way."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Sea&s;. Tho'ts. p. 265.</NOTE> Go&s;pel faith, repentance, and holy obedience, as the way of &s;alvation was abundantly taught by the apo&s;tles, and indeed the reigning &s;ubjects of their mini|&s;try. Our Saviour hath taught us the true and only way of life for &s;inful man, "&s;trait is the gate and narrow is the way which
<PB N="97" REF="019737_0116_0FACA3E4AC5234E8">
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." To &s;uppo&s;e there is any other way of life, is to &s;uppo&s;e our Lord taught it not perfectly, but partially and imperfectly, which is impious. "The grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation to men" doth it by "teaching them (effectually) the denial of all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, that we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world, (and not in the future, as the only way in which we are to be) "looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, (of &s;alvation) and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2.11, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</NOTE> to compleat it for us. We know it the great end of our Saviour in coming into the world "to &s;ave his people from their &s;ins" and not in them, Mat. 1.21. and that this was his great objective de&s;ign to men in this world in his great &s;acrifice, as the apo&s;tle adds, "who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works." <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">13, 14.</NOTE> That "he loved his church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it with the wa&s;hing of water by the word, (in this world) that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing; but that it &s;hould be holy and without blemi&s;h"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5.25, 26.</NOTE> to the prai&s;e of his grace, &mdash;"that in the day of judgment and throughout eternity, "he might be glorified and admired in all them that believe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. 1.20.</NOTE> Nor do we read of any others, by whom he will ever be glorified. This is a de&s;ign worthy the wi&s;dom and love of God. It is certainly of the highe&s;t importance to the glory of God and the Saviour, and good of men. Can then, any of mankind ever be &s;aved in a &s;tate of &s;in and oppo&s;ition, to it? Can there be any device in the plan of mercy and con&s;titution of grace, to &s;ecure &amp; effect &s;alvation to mankind without their comporting "with this de&s;ign" in being &s;anctified and meetened for it, in this life? If &s;o, it mu&s;t operate as a &s;uper&s;ede as of &s;ubver&s;ion, to the whole go&s;pel con&s;titution, and particularly, to the terms of life, and to this grand object of it; by rendering it unnece&s;&s;ary and po&s;&s;ible to be totally defeated: and yet, the &s;alvation of all men, be &s;ecured and accompli&s;hed. For if one can be &s;aved without it, then all mankind might be &s;aved without it, upon the &s;ame plan and in the &s;ame way. And it is &s;elf-evident, of
<PB N="98" REF="019737_0117_0FACA3E567FDC330">
cour&s;e this grand object of it might be totally defeated. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this plan, Chri&s;t might have no church in this world to be pre|&s;ented &mdash;yet all men be &s;aved. Now, is &s;uch a &s;elf-incon&s;i&s;|tent, &s;elf-repugnant and &s;elf-&s;ubver&s;ive &s;cheme, in the e&s;&s;ential parts of it; po&s;&s;ible, to be the production of infinite wi&s;dom and perfection?

It is in the highe&s;t degree ab&s;urd, di&s;honorable and impo&s;&s;ible. And the conclu|&s;ion is mo&s;t evident, viz. that the go&s;pel way of life as taught and inforced in this world, is exclu&s;ive of all others, and that none of mankind, but tho&s;e who comport with this great de|&s;ign of it (i. e.) who are &s;anctified and meetened for it in this world, can ever be &s;aved by the go&s;pel plan and con&s;titution of mercy.

<P>All hope of &s;alvation by this divine con&s;titution is limited, to tho&s;e of mankind, who are of a di&s;tinctive, di&s;tingui&s;hing character in this world, comporting with this great objective de&s;ign of it. All hopes of &s;alvation are by the promi&s;es of God, limited, "to the born of God," to the "believing," the "pe|nitent," "the pure in heart," "the obedient" "that do his commandments," "that are the children of Abraham, by imi|tation of his faith and piety." Our Saviour de&s;cribes his &s;heep, for whom he laid down his life, to whom it &s;hall be effectual to &s;alvation, by a di&s;tinctive, di&s;tingui&s;hing character, as called and led by him, "who hear his voice and follow him" and will not follow &s;trangers, Joh. 10.3, 4.5. and admits none as his friends but tho&s;e who do his commandments, Joh. 15.14.

limited to them, and never once extended to the finally di&s;o|bedient, in the revelations of God. In a word, all the promi&s;es of eternal life are made to tho&s;e who are the children of God by regeneration, adoption and divine imitation. "If children, then heirs," &amp;c. Now the children of God are abundantly di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the children of di&s;obedience, and of the wicked one. They are greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed, "by character," "by &s;tate" "by privileges and promi&s;es in this life" "at death" "in the re&s;urrection" "by &s;entence and retribution in the day of judgment" and by "heritage, portion and end" in the future and eternal world. There is no di&s;tinctions clearer, and no truths plainer in the book of God. And is it po&s;&s;ible, to mi&s;|take the purport and de&s;ign of the whole, when pointed out as with the finger of God to us, viz. that "the&s;e to whom &s;alva|tion is &s;o appropriated, and the&s;e only, &s;hall finally be &s;aved." Since a man may as well deny all &s;uch di&s;tinction to exi&s;t in this world, to take place at death, and in the re&s;urrection, as to confound and annul it at the day of judgment, or in eternity, to make way for the &s;alvation of any other; and in direct op|po&s;ition to the letter, &s;pirit and de&s;ign of it; a&s;&s;ign, "one end and portion" to the whole of mankind. For this appropria|tion of &s;alvation and the heavenly inheritance to the &s;anctified in Chri&s;t in this world; by &s;o many &s;cripture de&s;criptions, de|clarations, promi&s;es and benedictions, doth nece&s;&s;arily carry in it an exclu&s;ion of the ungodly: and will do it, while there is, meaning, propriety and force in language. It is the evident de&s;ign of it, and is a full refutation of their wild dream, "that the elect &s;hall fir&s;t be received to favour, and the re&s;t &s;hall fol|low after:" &s;ome be received "in the re&s;urrection morn," and others, after &s;uffering unutterable torments in hell for ages of ages, to which, the &s;criptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gives no countenance. And the denial of all &s;uch di&s;tinction between the godly and ungodly in this world, at death, in the re&s;urrection and final judgment, or annulling of it in the future world, are both alike oppo&s;ite, to the great, important, practical de&s;ign of it.</P>
<P>Which leads me to ob&s;erve fifthly,</P>
<P>The doctrine of the future puni&s;hment we maintain in op|po&s;ition to theirs, is interwoven throughout the go&s;pel con&s;ti|tution, in the letter and &s;pirit of it, in the practical and doctri|nal

parts of it; as a &s;trong inforcement of the requi&s;itions of duty, in it. "Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for what|&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. For he that &s;ow|eth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption: but he that &s;oweth to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life everla&s;ting." Gal. 5.7, 8. &s;o Rom. 8.13. "For if ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die: but if ye through the &s;pirit do mortify the deeds of of the body, ye &s;hall live." Life and death here are oppo&s;ed the one to the other, and are both eternal. For by death can|not be meant that which is natural&mdash;this comes on all through the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Adam&mdash;nor &s;piritual and moral death, for in this &s;en&s;e they are already dead: "tho&s;e that live in plea&s;ure are dead, while they live." It mu&s;t mean, the eternal death that is the ju&s;t wages of &s;in. "To be carnally minded is death; but to be &s;piritually minded is life and peace." "Having their fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end everla&s;ting life," but having their fruit, iniquity, "the end is eternal death:" for "Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will render to every man according to his deeds: to them, who by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life: but unto them that are contenti|ous, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, in|dignation and wrath; tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul that doth evil," Rom. 2.6, to 10. The texts to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, are too many to be recited.

<P>That eternal life in heaven, is the gift of God's grace, and is given to all who &s;hall ever enjoy it by way of promi&s;e; and is limited by promi&s;e, to tho&s;e who are heirs of it in this life.&mdash; Paul teacheth "the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord," Rom. 6.23. that "the inheritance was
<PB N="101" REF="019737_0120_0FACA3E7AF017668">
given to Abraham by promi&s;e," Gal. 3.18. that "they which are of faith are the children of Abraham, and heirs of the pro|mi&s;e, ib. v. 7, &amp; 29. and that "it is of faith that it might be of grace," and that "the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all his &s;eed" Rom. 4.16. meaning his "believing &s;eed," Jew or Gentiles, to whom the promi&s;e is made. St. John tells us, the gift of God is eternal life, that this life is in his Son&mdash;that he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life, 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. and our Lord tells us the way in which we "have the Son and this everla&s;ting life," Joh. 3.36. "He that believeth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life: and he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." Paul tells us "by faith we are all the children of God," Gal. 3.27. "If children then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t, Rom. 8.17. and "if ye be Chri&s;t's then are ye Abraham's &s;eed and heirs according to the promi&s;e," Gal. 3.29. It is plain in the&s;e texts, that eternal life in heaven, is given and be&s;towed on all the &s;aved, by promi&s;e; and the promi&s;e of it is limited to the &s;ubjects and heirs of faith only. They are all made and limited to the godly in this world; they only then, can and &s;hall be &s;aved, according to this divine con|&s;titution. Not a &s;ingle promi&s;e of it to unbelievers that die in their &s;ins, nor to any thing that can be done by them in the future &s;tate. Therefore the &s;entence of wrath mu&s;t abide upon them forever; as they can never have deliverance and &s;alva|tion in the way of the promi&s;e, which is &s;et forth in this con&s;ti|tution, and by which alone it is obtainable. They cannot have it, but of God's gift; they cannot have it, but "by pro|mi&s;e;" they cannot have it "by promi&s;e" unle&s;s heirs of it in this life. How is it po&s;&s;ible, that an eternal exclu&s;ion of the unbelieving and ungodly can be more fixed, and more &s;trongly a&s;certained, than is in this way effected by this con&s;titution, "which all along has been," "now is," "and always will be" the only way of life for &s;inful man.</P>
<P>I mention but one particular more, viz. Their doctrine of &s;alvation is e&s;&s;entially erroneous, and contrary to the go&s;pel doctrine of &s;alvation and redemption. The &s;alvation and re|demption exhibited in the go&s;pel is compleat and perfect, to all the happy &s;ubjects of it. A partial, incompleat, imperfect
<PB N="102" REF="019737_0121_0FACA3E8746DFF40">
&s;alvation, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom and perfection of God&mdash;with the obvious de&s;ign of the go&s;pel con&s;titution; and is not of a piece with the other works of God, "which are all perfect." And therefore is to be rejected as incredible and impo&s;&s;ible. Salvation, as exhibited in the go&s;pel, hath three con&s;tituent parts in it, viz. Salvation from the dominion of &s;in, accompanied with the &s;ub&s;titution and reign of divine grace in the &s;ubjects and heirs of it in this world; in connexion with their deliverance from wrath and de&s;truction in the world to come; and both the&s;e, in connexion with their everla&s;ting po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly inheritance. The&s;e are all in&s;eparably connected in the &s;alvation and redemption exhibited in the go&s;pel con&s;titution, and it knows no other. Chri&s;t the Saviour, "&s;aves his people from their &s;ins," makes them his willing peo|ple in the day of his power in this life, P&s;a. 110.3.&mdash;at death and judgment he delivers and &s;aves them from the wrath to come, and puts them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal life. Their doc|trine drops the two fir&s;t e&s;&s;entials in the go&s;pel &s;alvation, "de|liverance from &s;in in this world," and "from wrath in the world to come," and then a&s;&s;igns "eternal life to the wicked," not at death, nor in the la&s;t judgment, and no body knows when or how. Surely this doctrine is e&s;&s;entially different and con|trary to that taught in the word of God. The contrariety and oppo&s;ition of the two doctrines is obvious at fir&s;t view, in the &s;tating of them; and more &s;o, as they are compared together. By go&s;pel con&s;titution, tho&s;e that &s;hall be &s;aved, are all &s;ancti|fied and meetened for it in this world; but they teach all the un&s;anctified that die in their &s;ins &s;hall be &s;aved. Chri&s;t "came to &s;ave his people from their &s;ins," and we are expre&s;sly taught how and in what way, viz. "by &s;anctifying and purifying to him&s;elf, a peculiar people, zealous of good works," "living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, in this pre&s;ent world," Tit. 2.12, 14. They teach he came and died to &s;ave all the un&s;ancti|fied, that live and die in their &s;ins. Again, he came as truly to &s;ave us "from the cur&s;e" and future torment, as from our &s;ins, "was made a cur&s;e, to redeem us from the cur&s;e," Gal. 3.13. that partaking of his &s;alvation, we might never endure it. Yet again&s;t this de&s;ign of Chri&s;t, and this &s;alvation &s;o plainly taught, they tell us, many whom he &s;aves &s;hall yet endure the

Paul &s;ets forth the a&s;&s;urance of this, in a &s;trong point of light, in an inference drawn from the doctrine of ju&s;tification, by faith. If God hath de&s;igned the ju&s;tified by faith, for eternal life; and hath taken &s;uch an extraordinary &s;tep as "to give his own Son" to die for them when ungodly, "and by the grace of faith, hath brought them into a &s;tate of actual ju&s;tification, including in it, a title to eternal life," much more then (&s;ays he) being now ju&s;tified by his blood, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him." Rom. 5.1, 8, 9. Deliverance and &s;al|vation from the wrath to come, is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an e&s;&s;ential or rather is the very go&s;pel &s;alvation it&s;elf; which Chri&s;t de&s;igned and hath purcha&s;ed for his people, by being made a cur&s;e for them. Which doctrine is confirmed, and this great ble&s;&s;ing in&s;ured them, in the go&s;pel doctrine of ju&s;tification. But they teach many will &s;uffer this wrath to come, and yet be &s;aved. If &s;o, they mu&s;t be &s;aved without the go&s;pel &s;alvation; and what &s;al|vation is that? if they can be &s;aved, it mu&s;t be "without ju&s;|tification by the blood of Chri&s;t: for all that are ju&s;tified by his blood" to a man, "&s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him," by this inference and declaration of the apo&s;tle. And as this great e&s;&s;ential of &s;alvation, "deliverance from the wrath to come," is limited to tho&s;e, "who now in this life are ju&s;tified by his blood through faith," &s;o, the whole go&s;pel &s;alvation is appropriated and limited "to the obedient to Chri&s;t in this world," as Heb. 5.9. "And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal &s;alvation, unto all them that obey him." Why are the heirs and &s;ubjects of eternal &s;alvation, &s;o di&s;cri|minated by character, "tho&s;e that obey him?" Why is Chri&s;t &s;aid to be the author of this &s;alvation "to them" in di&s;tinction from the di&s;obedient; but to point out eternal &s;alvation as ap|propriated, as the peculiar, and limited to them only, "who obey him?" and this con&s;truction is confirmed by this, "he is never &s;aid to be the author of eternal &s;alvation to the finally di&s;obedient; but contrarywi&s;e, it is a&s;&s;erted, that he will "pu|ni&s;h

Yet, they aver again&s;t the plain language, import and de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, and the current doctrine of divine revelation, that he is the author of eternal &s;alvation to all the di&s;obedient, who &s;hall finally be &s;aved by him. Altho' at the &s;ame time, it is naturally impo&s;&s;ible; "tho&s;e, who are un&s;anctified in this world, and endure the wrath to come, can be &s;aved; in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e and plan of &s;alvation as before &s;tated: becau&s;e, it implies and carries in it as full a contradic|tion, as to &s;ay they may be &s;aved, without &s;alvation. Whence it is very evident, their doctrine of the &s;alvation of the finally di&s;obedient is e&s;&s;entially erroneous in it&s;elf; and as totally ex|cluded the go&s;pel con&s;titution, as the Mahometan paradi&s;e. And it reflects high di&s;honor upon the adorable Saviour, as an imperfect Saviour, bringing a partial imperfect &s;alvation to a great part of mankind, whom he undertakes to &s;ave: neither "&s;aving them from their &s;in in this world" nor "damnation in the world to come," according to his own divine, pre&s;cri|bed plan in the go&s;pel.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Doct. tells us, "It would indeed be a reproach to Chri&s;t, to introduce his blood as opperating to the &s;inner's ju&s;tification, in a way that God has not appointed." "If God has made it" nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;in|ner &s;hould be a believer, before he &s;hall be ju&s;tified, or, what means the &s;ame thing, before he &s;hall reap "&s;aving benefit" by the obedience and blood of Chri&s;t, we &s;hall give all due honor to this fini&s;hed work of his, while we con&s;ider it as available to the ju&s;tification (con&s;equently to the eternal &s;alvation) of the believing &s;inner ONLY." "We now give it its proper u&s;e; and &s;hould di&s;grace, rather than honor it, &s;hould we extend its u&s;e, and attribute to it a &s;ufficiency, to a purpo&s;e God never de&s;igned it for." As they mo&s;t evidently do, who attribute to it "a &s;ufficiency" and efficacy to &s;ave all the finally di&s;obedient &amp; unbelieving. See &s;ermons, p. 176, 7, 8. He further tells us, ib. p. 179, near the bottom, it is of meer mercy, "that his faith, by the go&s;pel con&s;titution, intere&s;ts him in the everla&s;ting advan|tages that re&s;ult from the obedience of Chri&s;t to the death of the cro&s;s." "This is the influence of faith."

which is &s;et forth in the go&s;pel. Did our Saviour and his a|po&s;tles teach and warrant us to teach "that &s;inners may go on in their &s;ins," "live in plea&s;ure in this world," "endure the wrath to come," and then "bow to the authority of God," and "have eternal life?" Surely, no &s;uch incongruous, incon|&s;i&s;tent, and horrible connexion, is to be found in the revelations of God. It is directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the doctrine of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. The contrary doctrine of godline&s;s is as clear as the &s;hining &s;un at noon-day, "that we mu&s;t take up his cro&s;s and follow him," "we mu&s;t be wa&s;hed, ju&s;tified, &s;anctified, in the name, by the &s;pirit, and through the faith of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in this world, and in that way "be delivered from the wrath to come," and "inherit eternal life." One would think, that the error, folly and impiety of a doctrine, that &s;tands in &s;uch a barefaced oppo&s;ition to the doctrine and way of &s;alvation &s;et forth in the go&s;pel, "&s;hould be manife&s;t to all men." For ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that doctrine of &s;alvation be from heaven, that is e&s;&s;entially wanting in two important con&s;tituent parts, of the go&s;pel &s;alvation? that teaches men to hope for a partial imperfect &s;al|vation? and when by con&s;titution they are excluded the inheri|tance? and when it becomes impo&s;&s;ible in nature, that they &s;hould enjoy the true, compleat go&s;pel &s;alvation? a doc|trine, that di&s;honours Chri&s;t, as a partial imperfect Savi|our; not &s;aving his people to the utmo&s;t, with the compleat &s;alvation taught by him&s;elf and his apo&s;tles? which reproacheth him as &s;aving tho&s;e who by the con&s;titution of mercy are con|&s;igned to utter perdition and everla&s;ting de&s;truction; and &s;aving them again&s;t the peremptory declarations of it; and by intro|ducing his blood as operating for the ju&s;tification and &s;alvation of &s;inners in a way that God hath not appointed: "yea, in direct oppo&s;ition, to the terms and way of &s;alvation expre&s;sly pre&s;cribed, in the go&s;pel?

If &s;o, it &s;eems both parts of a contradiction may be true. The &s;cripture doctrine of &s;al|vation, and theirs, are e&s;&s;entially different and contrary in their influence and effects, many other ways.

nece&s;&s;ary to men in this world; theirs teacheth it unnece&s;&s;ary to them in this world, to final &s;alvation&mdash;the true doctrine, con|firms and illu&s;trates the truth and glory of the promi&s;es; theirs makes the promi&s;e "void and of none effect." "It is of faith, to the end the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed," Rom. 4.16. But if the final unbelieving and ungodly can by any means and in any way whatever, become "heirs," and attain the in|heritance, then "faith is made void, and the promi&s;e of none ef|fect," as v. 14. becau&s;e neither "faith" nor "the promi&s;e" are of any con&s;equence or efficacy to &s;uch &s;alvation. And the doctrine that teacheth it, overthrows the go&s;pel doctrine "of faith and the promi&s;e," as the only way of &s;alvation. And on the &s;ame ground, the example of Abraham, and all the forcible argu|ments, and &s;trong rea&s;onings of the apo&s;tle, in &s;upport of the doctrine of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation by the faith of Chri&s;t only, are "made void and of none effect," by their doctrine. For if the unbelieving may be &s;aved, "faith is made void," of cour&s;e the doctrine of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, in their connexion with faith, with all their divine &s;upports, are likewi&s;e "made void and of none effect." They have no &s;ort of influence or connexion whatever with &s;uch a &s;alvation; but &s;tand in direct oppo&s;ition to it. 'Tis clear as day, that the doctrine of ju&s;ti|fication and &s;alvation by the faith of Chri&s;t, is the great go&s;pel doctrine that &s;hews &s;inful men, the true, the &s;ure, the only way of &s;alvation, by Chri&s;t. But if "faith be made void" in this e&s;&s;ential, nece&s;&s;ary connexion with ju&s;tification of life and final &s;alvation, as is the ca&s;e if all unbelievers &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved; then this fundamental doctrine, which is the great guide of peri&s;hing &s;inners to eternal life, "is made void" "and of none effect" in the &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle. And will any chri&s;tian ad|mit that doctrine as true, in the face of &s;uch a con&s;equence? In a word, the&s;e two doctrines of &s;alvation nece&s;&s;arily infer two e&s;&s;entially different and contrary rules of final judgment to mankind. The one clearly &s;et forth in the go&s;pel con&s;titution; and the other unknown in it, and reprobated by it. For it is &s;elf-evident to a reflecting mind, that one and the &s;ame rule and mea&s;ure of judgment, cannot ju&s;tify tho&s;e of oppo&s;ite characters; the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, believing and unbelieving, the one approved and the other mo&s;t expre&s;sly condemned by it. It is an evident
<PB N="107" REF="019737_0126_0FACA3ECEDF53E58">
contradiction. The &s;cripture rule of judgment expre&s;sly de|clares, "the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in the judgment, nor &s;in|ners in the congregation of the righteous," P&s;a. 1.5. It ex|pre&s;sly &s;evers the ju&s;t from the unju&s;t, and a&s;&s;igns them an in|finitely different inheritance, portion, and end&mdash;it announceth "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved," but "he that believeth not &s;hall be damned:" that "the righteous &s;hall go into life eter|nal; but "the di&s;obedient &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction:" It de&s;cribes the wicked in their particular cha|racters, and then expre&s;sly excludes them the inheritance of God's kingdom, and con&s;igns them to "the lake of fire," "and &s;hall be tormented day and night forever and ever." Now, it is evidently impo&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e condemned ones, after &s;en|tence and execution; &s;hould ever be approved, ju&s;tified, and &s;aved by this very rule and mea&s;ure of judgment, whereby they are excluded, condemned and con&s;igned to puni&s;hment. And it is to be further noted, that the &s;entence of final retribution, by the &s;cripture rule and mea&s;ure of judgment, is grounded upon the characters formed in this life and &s;tate, and not in the future, "according to the things done or not done in the body." This is the doctrine of revelation throughout. "Every man will be judged according to their works," Rev. 20.12, 13. "We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t: that every one may receive the things done in his body, (i. e. in &s;entence and execution) according to that he hath done, whe|ther it be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5.10. So taught the prophets, our Saviour in his parables, and in his repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment, and &s;o taught his apo&s;tles. And this rule, mea&s;ure and ground of judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt doth nece&s;&s;arily preclude and exclude all change of character and &s;tate; after this life and the final judgment. For the rule being infallible, and the ground of the &s;entence likewi&s;e unalterable, the righteous &s;entence pur&s;uant to it, can never be repealed, rever&s;ed or &s;uper&s;eded by this rule, or in a con&s;i&s;tency with it, and con&s;equently, it mu&s;t eternally remain in full force.

their condemnation, "the evil things done in the body" being in their nature unalterable&mdash;by the force of this divine rule, their condemnation mu&s;t be perpetual and unalterable. This rule of judgment alone, cuts up the doctrine of purgatory by the roots, as taught by papi&s;ts and univer&s;ali&s;ts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This evinces their tenet "that Chri&s;t will not finally and unalterably fix the &s;tates of all men at his &s;econd coming, but there will be a great deal after this to be done," to be an egregious error. Chri&s;t will then fix the &s;tates of all men, they allow&mdash;and how? by a righteous &s;entence of retribation: a &s;entence pur&s;uant to a rule that is unalterable: and upon a ground that is unalterable, "the things done in the body:" which mu&s;t evidently conclude and fix their &s;tates, unalterably. The Dr. is particular upon this point. He tells us "that no one can, in con&s;i&s;tency with truth, be judically declared ju&s;t, unle&s;s he really is &s;o in the eye, of that rule whatever it be, by which he is tried," Serm. p. 4. Can any final un|believer then be judicially declared ju&s;t, by that rule, "the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith?" Can he ever be adjudged to &s;alvation by that rule, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> not &s;hall be damned." Again he tells us, p. 12. "'Tis impo&s;&s;ible a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ence of approbation and condemnation &s;hould be the legal i&s;&s;ue of a proce&s;s upon the &s;ame law, at the &s;ame time," "this would be a glaring contradiction." Then it is impo&s;&s;ible for the wicked, who are condemned for their wickedne&s;s by the go&s;pel in the final judgment, ever to receive a &s;entence of approbation by the &s;ame go&s;pel, adjudging them to eternal life; "it would be a glaring contradiction." And again, p. 13. "If the law cur&s;es him, it cannot ju&s;tify him; if it convicts him of &s;in, it cannot acquit him of guilt: If it condemns him as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, it cannot vindicate him as a righteous per&s;on." Upon this &s;elf-evident ground of rea&s;on and truth, if the go&s;pel which is the rule of judgment, cur&s;es and condemns the final unbeliever and di&s;obedient; it cannot ju&s;tify and &s;ave him, nor can it be done, con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tent with it, as a rule of judgment.</NOTE> For all their purgatories can avail nothing, again&s;t the force of that rule of in&s;piration, that will infallibly determine the &s;tates of all men "according to their per&s;onal character and works in this &s;tate." Doth not the doctrine, that the wicked &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, nece&s;&s;arily infer a rule of judgment, whereby it can be effected, e&s;&s;entially different from, contrary to, and &s;ubver&s;ive of, this &s;cripture rule of judgment? Is not the taking away "the go&s;pel rule of judgment" to take away "the things that are written in this book?" Is it not to add to the things that are written? to &s;ub&s;titute, add and teach another rule for &s;cripture, whereby all the condemned by the go&s;pel rule of judgment, &s;hall yet be ju&s;tified and &s;aved?

For if Chri&s;t hath made a propitiation &s;ufficient for the &s;alvation of all men,&mdash;if it is free and &s;ure to all men upon the &s;ame terms, and he doth in fact u&s;e all &s;uitable means in the go&s;pel to induce their compliance,&mdash;and all who comply with the terms of life &s;hall in fact be &s;aved; and that he doth in fact &s;ave all who are willing to receive his &s;alvation, and who&s;e characters finally will admit them to be &s;aved in con&s;i&s;tence with the nature, terms, de&s;ign and rule of the con&s;titution of mercy, where is there a &s;hadow of foundation for reproach? Again, if tho&s;e that peri&s;h, peri&s;h for their own iniquity; mo&s;t ju&s;tly, under the go&s;pel, for neglecting and rejecting the great &s;alvation; by the force and rule of the con&s;titution of mercy it&s;elf; and circum&s;tanced as their ca&s;e is, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and honor of the divine character, authority and moral government of God: it is inconceivable how any reproach can po&s;&s;ibly be fa&s;tened upon Chri&s;t, the Saviour and Judge. Is it any reflection upon him, that men choo&s;e or refu&s;e for them&s;elves? or that they choo&s;e their own delu&s;ions, and will pur&s;ue them? or, that they &s;hould "reap" as they have "&s;own," and &s;hould receive and be awarded according to their own choice, in their choo&s;ing time? who will avow it? If there was any truth in the &s;ugge&s;tion, their &s;cheme reflects di&s;honor upon Chri&s;t in the &s;ame way, viz. becau&s;e he doth not in fact &s;ave all men with a compleat &s;alvation in this world and world to come. It is a truth he doth not &s;ave all men from their &s;ins, nor from the de&s;tructions which follow them in this world, nor from the wrath to come, as he doth "his peculiar people" "that believe and obey him." Now if the reproach mu&s;t fall upon Chri&s;t, in ca&s;e he doth not finally &s;ave them with the eternal &s;alvation of the people of God: why not on the &s;ame ground that he doth not effect for them this great &s;alvation al&s;o, with which he ble&s;&s;eth his peculiar people? But &s;urely, it can be no reproach to Chri&s;t, not to &s;ave them "who will not come to him for life," who neglect and refu&s;e his &s;alvation, who reject all his overtures, counteract the force of all his &s;aving means, who render his death vain, "who trample under foot his precious blood," "who do di&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace," and con|tinue irreconcilable enemies to God: and when by go&s;pel con&s;titution they cannot be &s;aved. But it would be the highe&s;t reproach to him, to ju&s;tify and &s;ave the wicked: It would be to counteract the divine perfections, to overthrow the moral character, the authority, law, and go&s;pel of God; with all the rules and ends of his moral government. It can be no reproach to him, that he doth not &s;ave them, when in future torment. It is not the work a&s;&s;igned him in the go&s;pel con&s;titution, it is unknown in it. It is excluded and every where reprobated by it. It is no reproach to him as Judge, to exclude and condemn to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, tho&s;e that are excluded by the con&s;titution of mercy, and who are &s;o to be condemned by the righteous rules of it; but it is a high reproach upon his cha|racter to &s;uppo&s;e he will not do it. It is no reproach to him, as &s;u|preme Lord, Governor and Judge of all worlds, to render a righteous and eternal retribution to all moral &s;ubjects according to their character and works: to &s;ettle the kingdom of God in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace: to gain a compleat victory and eternal triumph over all the incur|able enemies of it, whether of heaven or earth, by con&s;igning them to a de&s;erved everla&s;ting de&s;truction; and al&s;o to be admired in all that believe; and to be glorified as a Judge in all the condemned and lo&s;t, as well as in all that are &s;aved, as he a&s;&s;uredly will be. Upon this plain, &s;cripture plan, all ground of reproach to Chri&s;t is evidently taken away, be tho&s;e that pe|ri&s;h many or few. It is much to be wi&s;hed that men, in&s;tead of giving way to a bold &s;ugge&s;tion, would reflect, and range their thoughts in the &s;crip|ture line of truth, and they would at once &s;ee, there is no foundation for this ba&s;e, mo&s;t reproachful reflection, upon the Lord of glory. The &s;ug|ge&s;tion, plainly goes upon the old plan of ca&s;ting off the blame from the &s;in|ner, upon the tempter, or upon God. "The &s;erpent beguiled me, and I did eat," &s;aid the woman. "The woman, which thou gave&s;t to be with me, &s;he gave me of the tree, and I did eat," &s;aid the man. Tacitly and implicitly ca&s;ting the reproach and blame upon God the giver. So if heaven doth not adopt and carry into full execution their corrupt &s;cheme of &s;aving all the wicked, then it &s;eems, the&s;e men will ca&s;t the reproach of all that peri&s;h, upon the Lord of glory. But how groundle&s;s, unju&s;t and impious is it, "when they are judged according to the deeds done in the body," and "receive the things done in the body?" Our Lord exerted him&s;elf faithfully and painfully to &s;ave the Jews from unparrallel'd de|&s;truction. They were not &s;aved, but &s;unk under his neglected admonitions and warnings, into unexampled ruin. Where does he fa&s;ten the reproach and blame? upon him&s;elf, according to this &s;ugge&s;tion? in no wi&s;e, but wholly upon them. "How often would I have gathered thy children toge|ther as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?" "Behold your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate," Mat. 23.37, 38. his judg|ment is infallible. So their mi&s;carriage of &s;alvation, he charges to their ob&s;tinacy. "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." That declaration of God which &s;hut the mouth of Cain, will &s;ilence all the re|proaches of the wicked: "if thou doe&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? and if thou doe&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door," Gen. 4.7. Surely, the blame and con&s;equences, tho' eternal, mu&s;t lie at the "door, where &s;in lieth." And that home addre&s;s, carries &s;trong conviction in it; "if thou be wi&s;e, thou &s;halt be wi&s;e for thy&s;elf: but if thou &s;corne&s;t, thou alone &s;halt bear it," Prov. 9.12. It is natural to ob&s;erve, the charge of reflec|ting reproach upon Chri&s;t, comes with an ill grace from tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;cheme is &s;ubver&s;ive of the character, authority, and moral government of God, and of natural and revealed religion; who&s;e doctrine makes faith void; the pro|mi&s;es &mdash;the example of Abraham&mdash;the go&s;pel doctrine of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation void and of none effect; and &s;ubverts the go&s;pel doctrine of the cro&s;s and rule of final judgment: and di&s;honors Chri&s;t as an imperfect Sa|viour, and by "introducing his blood as operating to the &s;inners ju&s;tifica|tion and &s;alvation in a way not appointed by God," and again&s;t the me|thod pre&s;cribed in the go&s;pel, and many other ways as hath and will be &s;hewn. The charge comes with a peculiar ill grace from "&s;ome of them" who highly di&s;honor Chri&s;t, by a very corrupt con&s;truction of his own words. (E. G.) our Saviour addre&s;&s;es a mo&s;t &s;olemn woe and warning to Judas, as Mark 14.21. "The Son of Man indeed goeth as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man, if he had never been born." The words are expre&s;|&s;ive of high indignation again&s;t the trea&s;on, and a heavy puni&s;hment to the traitor: &s;o that it would have been better for him, "if he had never had a being." To &s;ay, it means, "that he would have e&s;caped all the di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered in this world, and might have been happy, if he had never been born," is a con&s;truction, by which the pointed indignation, the heavy puni&s;hment, with the terror and force of the warning, are all lo&s;t; is not this to di&s;honor Chri&s;t? Again, he gives a pointed de&s;cription of Judas, as "the &s;on of perdition, that is lo&s;t," John 17. v. 6 to 13 in|clu&s;ive. He &s;peaks expre&s;sly "of the men given him out of the world," "to whom he manife&s;ted the Father's name," "to whom he gave his words," "who received them," "have known and believed him &s;ent, by him," "who were with him," "kept by him" and "none of them lo&s;t, but the &s;on of perdition," "that the &s;cripture might be fulfilled." Evi|dently referring to the &s;cripture that predicted his crime and puni&s;hment. How could he have given, a more pointed characteri&s;tic de&s;cription, of Judas? Is it not then to di&s;honor Chri&s;t, fir&s;t to deny Judas is intended, and then to confront and endeavour to overthrow all this evidence of the truth, by mo&s;t fal&s;e and pitiful eva&s;ions? as to &s;ay, "the fallen angel bears the character of perdition," in which there is no truth: "&s;in is pro|duced by him, and therefore &s;tiled a &s;on." But can this &s;on, &s;in, be one "of the men given him out of the world," "to whom he manife&s;|ted the father's name," "gave his words," "who received them," "be|lieved him &s;ent, by him," "who was with him?" &amp;c. How fal&s;e and &s;tupidly ab&s;urd? Or to &s;ay, "the &s;oul of Judas was the breath of God," "and his body produced by ordinary generation," and "neither the fa|ther of his &s;pirit nor his natural parents could be termed perdition." How ridiculou&s;ly impertinent? For Judas by character and righteous de&s;igna|tion, might &s;urely be "the &s;on of perdition," it is the thing intended. Ju&s;t as the malicious Jews were by charter and imitation "of their father the devil, John 8.44. and as Elymas "was a child of the devil," Acts 13.10. "But to put it out of all doubt" we are told "Paul hath declared the &s;on of perdition to be the man of &s;in, who is to be revealed previous to the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t," 2 The&s;. 2.3. this makes bad, wor&s;e&mdash;by a mo&s;t evident perver&s;ion of one &s;cripture, to ju&s;tify the perver&s;ion of ano|ther. For how evident, this man of &s;in which had then no being, who&s;e exi&s;tence was then future, and was to commence &s;ome ages after, cannot be the &s;on of perdition, intended by our Saviour? Can this man of &s;in be one of "the men given him out of the world," "who had been with him," &amp;c. How a&s;toni&s;hing? It &s;eems out of doubt indeed, that tho&s;e who &s;o teach and write, either know not what they are about, or mean to deceive and impo&s;e upon others. And &s;uch perver&s;ions are the more inexcu&s;able, be|cau&s;e the &s;en&s;e of our Saviour, to tho&s;e who attend to &s;cripture language, is very obvious. As "children of wrath" are heirs of wrath, Eph. 2.3. and as "children of God are heirs of God," Rom. 8.27. and as &s;uch, de|&s;tined to the heavenly inheritance. So Judas is a "&s;on of perdition" as an heir of perdition, who hath merited it, and is de&s;ignated and con&s;igned to perdition, by the righteous judgment of God. If &s;uch notorious per|ver&s;ions of &s;cripture, be not to "corrupt the word of God" and "to handle it deceitfully," where can we find it? Equally fal&s;e and more pernicious, is the con&s;truction of "the &s;heep and goats," 25 Mat. By &s;heep we are told "is intended every &s;on and daughter of Adam." But our Saviour points out "his &s;heep" by a di&s;tinctive, di&s;tingui&s;hing character "from the re&s;t of the world," in John 10. v. 3, 4, 5, 16, 26, 27, 28. and the&s;e no doubt are the &s;heep here intended. "The goat"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See &s;ome deductions from the &s;y&s;tem of revelation, p. 19, 20, 21, 22.</NOTE> it is &s;aid "in many places is given as the figure of the fallen angelic nature." But how wild and pre|&s;umptuous, when not an in&s;tance is found to &s;upport it? the matter is very plain. Our Lord had often taught, in the great day "he would fever the ju&s;t from the unju&s;t," &amp;c. here from the 31&s;t to the end, he &s;hews the man|ner of the proce&s;s, viz. "by gathering of all nations of men before him," "by &s;eparating them one from another according to their character "as ju&s;t or unju&s;t" which he &s;ets forth by the natural figure of "a &s;hepherd dividing his &s;heep from the goats;" he will then pa&s;s &s;entence upon the one and the other "according to their character and works." And when the &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed, the wicked will not look up to the Saviour and be &s;aved as they pre&s;umptuou&s;ly teach, "but go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righteous into life eternal." This con&s;truction is mo&s;t plain and ea&s;y, and perfectly agrees with every repre&s;entation of the final judgment throughout revelation. Whereas the con&s;truction we oppo&s;e doth not admit "the ju&s;t &s;hall be &s;evered from the unju&s;t," the good from the bad," "the faithful from the unfaithful," and that "all &s;hall per&s;onally receive in actual re|tribution, "according to the things done in the body," tho' abundantly taught by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles. It is therefore directly oppo&s;ite to and &s;ubver&s;ive of the &s;cripture doctrine of the eternal judgment. It is &s;trange that any who have read the &s;cripture with attention can endure &s;uch an enormous error, and encourage &s;uch teaching, again&s;t that divine pro|hibition in the &s;econd epi&s;tle of John v. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>

Will wickedne&s;s &s;ay, "Lord open unto us," is it not bla&s;phemy to &s;uppo&s;e it? Can it plead "we have eat and drank in thy pre&s;ence, and thou ha&s;t taught in our &s;treets?" Can it be characteri&s;ed "workers of iniquity?" Can wickedne&s;s and what of the devil is in men &s;eparate from the &s;ouls and bodies of men, be "the children of the king|dom?" are we ever &s;o taught? Can it &s;eparate from the wicked "&s;ee Abraham and the patriarchs in the kingdom of God," and be the "ye your&s;elves thru&s;t out?" and be the &s;ubject of "weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth?" and be "tormented day and night forever and ever?" Can it give an account," "be judged according to his works," "receive the things done in the body," or agree with any one &s;cripture de&s;cription of the final judgment and future puni&s;hment?" by no means: it is a &s;taring error. And it &s;eems a man mu&s;t have a &s;trangely perverted under&s;tanding and con&s;cience, to put &s;uch a thin, barefaced, mo&s;t pernicious cheat upon him&s;elf, or to attempt it upon others. For the matter is reduced to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue&mdash;either the &s;ubjects of threatnings and penal &s;tatutes, after condem|nation, mu&s;t per&s;onally &s;uffer the puni&s;hment denounced, or they mu&s;t not. If not, all government of God and man is &s;truck up with one blow&mdash;there is no truth and ju&s;tice in the univer&s;e&mdash;tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors have nothing to fear &mdash;men and devils nothing to &s;uffer&mdash;yea, and Mo&s;es and the prophets, our Saviour and his apo&s;tles are condemned for "u&s;ing the terrors of the Lord, to per&s;uade men" to repentance and reconciliation to God. But if they mu&s;t per&s;onally &s;uffer the puni&s;hment threatned, then it is as certain that the unju&s;t in their per&s;ons &s;hall be re&s;erved to puni&s;hment,"&mdash;and "the finally di&s;obedient &s;hall per&s;onally be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction" as there is truth in the Deity and in the revelation he hath given us.</NOTE> Mat. 8.12. they never were "children of the kingdom," only by the means and privileges of it. The ca&s;ting them out, mu&s;t &s;urely mean, a total deprivation of them; nothing le&s;s can be intended. So that "go&s;pel means of &s;alvation &s;hall never pa&s;s upon them" as they teach.

as their exi&s;tence, as they have no way out of it. Moreover, they cannot be &s;aved by any means ordinary or extraordinary, all hopes of it are excluded and barred, by our Saviour in his parable of Dives and Lazarus&mdash;in the an&s;wer of Abraham to Dives, teaching there is no pa&s;&s;ing from that &s;tate of torment to the &s;ociety of Abraham and the ble&s;&s;ed, Luke 16.26, 31. Neither can they be &s;aved, by any terms of mercy and life pub|li&s;hed in the revelations of God. The&s;e terms are pre&s;cribed for, addre&s;&s;ed and limited to mankind in this &s;tate, only, as hath been &s;hewn. Not a &s;ingle one extended to tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins in the future &s;tate. They cannot be &s;aved by faith, repentance, bowing to the authority of God, and becoming his willing &s;ubjects in that &s;tate, as they may in this. There is not an intimation in the whole book of God, of &s;uch a thing po&s;&s;ible to them in that &s;tate; nor any encouragement for it; nor promi&s;e made to it: which takes away all ground of hope; e&s;pecially, as our Lord hath fixed it upon another i&s;&s;ue, which is deci&s;ive, viz. not upon the footing of any thing whatever to be done by them: but upon that of &s;ufferings only, to the full demerit of their &s;ins. When delivered over to puni&s;hment, and ca&s;t into pri&s;on, "he a&s;&s;ures us with a very &s;trong a&s;&s;eve|ration,

"verily I &s;ay unto thee, thou &s;halt by no means come out thence, till thou ha&s;t paid the uttermo&s;t farthing," Mat. 5.25, 26. Since all means and ways of deliverance are ex|pre&s;sly excluded, but that of &s;uffering the eternal death which is the ju&s;t wages of &s;in: all hope of it mu&s;t be barred and cut off forever. Their re&s;ources of relief are al&s;o particularly ex|cluded and barred. All the hope of peri&s;hing &s;inners is in the infinite mercy and grace of God; but this mercy, by go&s;pel con&s;titution is limited to "ve&s;&s;els of mercy afore-prepared un|to glory," in this world. "And there is no provi&s;ion of mercy for &s;inners continuing &s;uch," but it is written of the wicked "he &s;hall have judgment without mercy," Jam. 2.13. and "they &s;hall have wrath without mixture," Rev. 14.10. Again, all hope from the death and &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, to tho&s;e who make it vain in this world, is totally excluded: for it is writ|ten, "his death &s;hall profit them nothing:" and "there re|mains no more &s;acrifice for &s;in," to them&mdash;neither this or any other, "but a fearful looking for of judgment, which &s;hall de|vour the adver&s;aries." Moreover, they cannot work out their deliverance and &s;alvation by their own ability, or by any thing which can be done by them. For our Lord repre&s;ents them, when "ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s, into a &s;tate of weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth," "as bound hand and foot," Mat. 22.13. under total di&s;ability for &s;uch exertion. But how can this be true of unimbodied &s;pirits, or of the wicked after the re&s;urrec|tion? there is doubtle&s;s important truth and in&s;truction in it: nor is it difficult to find it. In the con&s;titution and frame of human minds, Hope is the main&s;pring of action and exertion: de&s;pair cuts the &s;inews of all endeavour. Therefore the door of mercy mu&s;t be opened, to &s;pring hope and exertion. And when this door is forever &s;hut again&s;t them, all exertion for &s;alvation is as effectually excluded and barred; as activity is to him who is literally "bound hand and foot." And our Sa|viour teacheth us "this door will be &s;hut" again&s;t them, Luk. 13.25. which is another &s;trong evidence "that go&s;pel means &s;hall never pa&s;s upon them."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;t in his human &s;pirit, in the interim between his death and re&s;urrection, went and preached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on. So they con&s;true the words of Peter, 1 Pet. 3.18, 19, 20. "but quickened by the Spirit; by which al&s;o he went and preached unto the &s;pirits in pri&s;on; which &s;ometime were di&s;obedient, when once the long-&s;uffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, &amp;c. But this con&s;truction is incon&s;i&s;tent with the letter of the text, which &s;peaks expre&s;sly of "the &s;pirit whereby Chri&s;t was quickened" in his re&s;urrection&mdash;and not of his human &s;pirit. By which eternal Spirit he in&s;pired Noah a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to teach and warn tho&s;e di&s;obedient &s;inners while the ark was con&s;tructing, who were now in pri&s;on. This is the de&s;igned in&s;truc|tion. And this con&s;truction of theirs is incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign for which the apo&s;tle here and in 2 Pet. 2.5, to the 10th, introduceth the ex|ample of the &s;alvation of Noah, and the de&s;truction of the di&s;obedient of the old world. It is adduced for warning, that the di&s;obedient and ungodly under the go&s;pel, &s;hall be ca&s;t into the pri&s;on of hell, and "be re&s;erved to the day of judgment, to be puni&s;hed;" as exemplified in the di&s;obedient, that peri&s;hed from under the preaching of Noah. And al&s;o to admoni&s;h, encourage and animate chri&s;tians &s;o to do and &s;uffer the will of God, as to an&s;wer the great de&s;ign of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, that they may be ble&s;|&s;ed and enjoy the great &s;alvation of God, as exemplified in that of Noah. Now the de&s;igned in&s;truction, warning, admonition and animating en|couragement are all lo&s;t, in their con&s;truction; which &s;hews it cannot be true. This con&s;truction of theirs, is likewi&s;e confuted, by the manife&s;t ab&s;urdity of it. According to &s;cripture, the work of Chri&s;t and his mini|&s;ters is to preach the go&s;pel to tho&s;e under the di&s;pen&s;ation of his kingdom; and not to tho&s;e that are out of it; as tho&s;e are who die in their &s;ins. How ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;t in per&s;on &s;hould go and preach to tho&s;e in pri&s;on, with whom he has no more concern as a Saviour, than with the devil and his angels their a&s;&s;ociates in character and mi&s;ery; to whom he was not appointed a Mediator and Saviour? How ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e him to go and preach the go&s;pel of life to them, when he knew it would be all lo&s;t labour, and not a &s;oul of them would hear, repent and live? when he knew and had taught the world in the parable of Dives, their characters and &s;tate was fixed, and would admit of no change? and had repeatedly taught, that in the day of judgment they &s;hould be condemned and puni&s;hed, as workers of iniquity? and very expre&s;sly that "they that have done evil, &s;hall come forth unto the re&s;urrection of damnation?" John 5.29. which is deci&s;ive, there is no change of character and &s;tate to them, between death and the re&s;urrection. It is evident their con&s;truction cannot by any means be ad|mited: but if it was, it avails them nothing. For the go&s;pel was not preach|ed to them in pri&s;on, in the exten&s;ive addre&s;s of mercy and hope, in which it is now preached to all the nations of the earth: but is limited "to the di&s;obedient in the days of Noah." The re&s;t of the di&s;obedient, ungodly world, notwith&s;tanding this &s;uppo&s;ed partial, preaching of it, are left un|der condemnation, without hope, re&s;erved to the day of judgment, to be puni&s;hed." Their end is de&s;truction.</NOTE></P>

And con&s;equently, the impo&s;&s;ibility of their &s;al|vation is fully evinced. It &s;eems proper in this place to con|&s;ider two doctrines which are main pillars in the &s;cheme of our opponents, that are directly oppo&s;ite to the exhibition we have given of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, and are to be con&s;idered as objections again&s;t it, viz. One is, that the future puni&s;hment is a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, "to make the &s;ubjects of it a willing people" and fit them for heaven; and not &s;trictly of retribu|tion. It is a di&s;ciplinary, and not capital puni&s;hment. The other is, that at &s;ome unknown period, they will all bow to the authority of God&mdash;and &s;o be delivered and &s;aved. As to the fir&s;t point, it is to be noted, that a &s;tate of trial, and a &s;tate of retribution, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e, of di&s;cipline and of capital pu|ni&s;hment, are as di&s;tinct and contra&s;ted as any two things in nature, as virtue and vice, as life and death&mdash;e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent in nature and de&s;ign. And it is to be ob&s;erved, the &s;cripture con&s;tantly holds up this di&s;tinction, as what makes the grand, the infinite difference between the &s;tates of men in this world and world to come. For there is no doctrine more plain throughout revelation, than that this is, a &s;tate of trial and di&s;cipline; and the future a &s;tate of retribution in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e as contra&s;ted with it. And it is &s;ealed and confirmed beyond doubt, by the doctrine of the eternal judgment, where|in we are taught "every man &s;hall be judged and be rewarded according to his works:" and "he that is unju&s;t, &s;hall be un|ju&s;t &s;till," and "he that is holy &s;hall be holy &s;till." Add to this, every de&s;cription of the future puni&s;hment, announces it to be capital, retribut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> puni&s;hment; and not di&s;cipline. Is death, by the hand of public ju&s;tice, that is the award of ju&s;tice, and cuts men off from the kingdoms of this world, a capital puni&s;hment, with men? &s;o is that death, that cuts off the wicked from the kingdom of God, and in which they mu&s;t endure the ju&s;t, the full wages of &s;in. And the perdition and
<PB N="119" REF="019737_0138_0FACA3F79C76E168">
de&s;truction of the ungodly, pur&s;uant to their demerit, and to judicial &s;entence executed in a di&s;pen&s;ation of wrath and ju&s;tice, nece&s;&s;arily carries the idea of capital puni&s;hment. And when the word eternal or everla&s;ting is added, it is capital, retributive puni&s;hment in the &s;tricte&s;t, highe&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e conceivable by the mind of man. The &s;criptures are very plain, that in the &s;en&s;e of &s;trict retribution, "God will render vengeance to his enemies," "and reward them that hate him." But the idea of di&s;cipline annexed to the future puni&s;hment, &s;hocks us by its ab&s;urdity and impiety, every way. Who&s;e di&s;cipline is it? we know of no di&s;cipline to &s;ave men, but that appoint|ed in the kingdom of Chri&s;t; and exerci&s;ed under his adorable admini&s;tration. But this puni&s;hment is inflicted after the di&s;|pen&s;ation of his kingdom is ended, and the great affairs of it are all &s;ettled in the day of judgment, and on tho&s;e, who are cut off and ca&s;t out of it, and from all the di&s;cipline and pri|vileges of it, and are delivered over to be tormented, &amp;c. Surely, it can be none of his di&s;cipline. If their doctrine of di&s;cipline be admitted, then the devils are now under a di&s;ci|pline of mercy, for &s;alvation. Yea, they are the fir&s;t candi|dates for it, for this puni&s;hment was originally prepared and appointed for them, Mat. 25.41. which &s;uppo&s;ition is abhor|rent to &s;cripture and common &s;en&s;e. Again, if the doctrine of future retribution, be a doctrine of di&s;cipline, then in the day of judgment the righteous will be adjudged to a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, as well as the wicked, in which it will be po&s;&s;ible for them to change their &s;tate, and to lo&s;e their characters and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to eternity. Which is too &s;hocking to be admitted, nor do they admit it. Yet the doctrine of retribution is the &s;ame to both; and the &s;cripture makes no di&s;tinction, "every one &s;hall be rewarded according to their works," and "every one &s;hall receive according to the things done in the body." Con&s;equently, the character and &s;tates of both, will be fixed for eternity in that day, or neither of them. Moreover, according to their doctrine, a &s;tate of outer darkne&s;s is more effectual, &s;avingly to enlighten men, than all the light of the go&s;pel: a &s;tate of wrath and di&s;pen&s;ation of wrath, more effectual to &s;ub|due and &s;often the hearts of men, than a &s;tate of mercy, under all the &s;oftening, transforming means and grace of the go&s;pel:
<PB N="120" REF="019737_0139_0FACA3F829A85268" MS="y">
and a &s;tate of univer&s;al wickedne&s;s into which, all the prodi|gate and abandoned of the earth, with the devil and his angels, are ca&s;t, without a &s;ingle godly &s;oul in it; is a more effectual &s;chool to form to holine&s;s and meeten &s;ubjects for heaven; than the fellow&s;hip of &s;aints, the &s;ociety, examples and prayers of the godly, and all the light, means, and grace of the kingdom of God, in this world. For altho' the latter are effectual for the &s;alvation of many; yet they are not effectual to the &s;alva|tion of all under the di&s;pen&s;ation of it. Whereas that di&s;ci|pline is maintained to be &s;o effectual, as that all that are exer|ci&s;ed with it, &s;hall be &s;aved. What can be more abhorrent to common &s;en&s;e? or more reproachful to Chri&s;t, to his go&s;pel and kingdom? A man that can &s;wallow &s;uch &s;hocking impiety and ab&s;urdity, may &s;wallow a camel. Let this que&s;tion be fairly examined, viz. Can their doctrine agree, with the doc|trine of di&s;cipline taught in &s;cripture, and by common &s;en&s;e? Is that puni&s;hment among men, which is to the &s;ubject of it "death," "de&s;truction," "perdition," utter ruin, di&s;cipline; and not capital? if not, how can a puni&s;hment with everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction, be di&s;cipline? In the &s;cripture exhibition of di&s;cipline, a door of mercy is opened, terms and means of &s;al|vation are appointed, whereby &s;inful men may be reconciled and &s;aved. But the door is &s;hut&mdash;all the&s;e are excluded to tho&s;e, who are cut off and ca&s;t out of the kingdom in the future pu|ni&s;hment. Scripture di&s;cipline, is to form the characters of men for a future judgment and a &s;tate of retribution: af|ter the characters of all, are already formed, di&s;clo&s;ed, and judgment rendered on them, &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed and put in execu|tion, wherein the righteous are rewarded and the wicked pu|ni&s;hed. Again, it is a grand object and end of di&s;cipline as taught by &s;cripture and common &s;en&s;e, to form men to be good &s;ubjects of the &s;tates and kingdoms of this world, and of the kingdom of God. But how can a capital puni&s;hment, that cuts them off and &s;huts them out of both kingdoms, po&s;&s;ibly agree with it? In the divine di&s;cipline, infinite wi&s;dom &s;o tempers judgments with mercies, as to be be&s;t adapted to the good of the &s;ubject. But how can a di&s;pen&s;ation of judgment without mercy, and "wrath without mixture" con&s;i&s;t with it? A grand object of di&s;cipline is the good of the &s;ubject exerci&s;ed
<PB N="121" REF="019737_0140_0FACA3F8ED6BAF80">
with it. But vindictive wrath as held forth in all the di&s;crip|tions of the future puni&s;hment, and the en&s;amples of it in this world, is not for the good of tho&s;e who peri&s;h in it; but for the vindication and &s;upport of the divine character and govern|ment, and for the good of others. How incongruous and ab|&s;urd would it be to addre&s;s a criminal going to execution, in the language of di&s;cipline? to tell him, in the de&s;ign of govern|ment you are going to be hanged for your good; to make you a good &s;ubject, and meeten you for the privileges of that king|dom of which you will be forever cut off, by it. And equally fal&s;e, &s;hocking and more wicked, to addre&s;s &s;inners&mdash;"if you go on in your &s;ins, you will be damned for your good; to meeten you for the inheritance of that kingdom of Chri&s;t and of God, from which you are ca&s;t out, cut off and excluded, by your puni&s;hment." One in&s;tance more, in &s;cripture di&s;cipline, the object is, that men be &s;aved in the day of the Lord, and not condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 5.5. ch. 11.32. and infinite wi&s;dom, love and care is exerci&s;ed in an addre&s;s of the mo&s;t powerful motives, to pre&s;erve and &s;upport the characters of tho&s;e who are heirs and to inherit the heavenly kingdom. They are enjoined "to keep them&s;elves from idols" "un&s;pot|ted from the world," "to &s;hew them&s;elves children of their heavenly father" by divine imitation&mdash;"to &s;hine as lights of the world," "that others by their good works might glorify their heavenly Father," "that they may be pre&s;erved unre|bukeable," "be accounted meet and worthy, the heavenly in|heritance prepared for them." But how e&s;&s;entially different and oppo&s;ite, the di&s;pen&s;ation of God to the wicked in the day of judgment and world to come? Their characters expo&s;ed, and all their wickedne&s;s, &s;ecret and open, laid open to the view of all worlds in the day of judgment: then ca&s;t out of the king|dom as accur&s;ed, and con&s;igned to the mo&s;t ignominious and painful puni&s;hment with the devil and his angels; con&s;igned to &s;hame and "everla&s;ting contempt?" Now, is it po&s;&s;ible that the pre&s;ervation and total de&s;truction and ruin of charact|ers, &s;hould both be appointed "to form characters and meeten &s;ubjects for the &s;ame kingdom &amp; inheritance?" Can both un|der one denomination and character of "di&s;cipline" belong to the &s;ame plan of mercy, and con&s;titution of grace, whereby

<P>I pa&s;s to the other tenet, viz. That all who are con&s;igned to the future puni&s;hment, will in &s;ome future period, bow to the authority of God, and &s;o be delivered and &s;aved. Their prin|cipal &s;upport is, I&s;a. 45.22, 23. "Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth:" (not hell) "for I am God, and there is none el&s;e." "I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not re|turn, that unto me every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear." Refering the particular de&s;ign of the&s;e words to ano|ther place, I &s;hall ob&s;erve two or three things to clear the text from their con&s;truction. I would fir&s;t ob&s;erve, St. Paul twice quotes and applies the&s;e words, but not to e&s;tabli&s;h this future bowing and &s;alvation of the condemned, in the la&s;t judgment. Once it is to &s;et forth the &s;upreme and uncontroulable domin|ion of Chri&s;t over all things, Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. This will be il|lu&s;trate when in fact "every creature (friend or enemy) &s;hall be made to bow to him," and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord," the &s;upreme Governor and Judge of all. But this is con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;truction of his enemies: yea, it is this &s;upreme uncontroulable dominion and powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Chri&s;t that in&s;ures the everla&s;tling &s;alvation of his people, and de&s;truction of his enemies.

"For we mu&s;t all &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t," "for it is written, as I live &s;aith the Lord, every knee &s;hall bow to me, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to God." It is evident from this application of the words of the prophet, that they will have their fulfilment in the day of judgment, and it is the la&s;t fulfilment they will ever have, for it is the la&s;t we read of. But it is certain that "this bowing and confe&s;&s;ing will not be accompanied and connected with the &s;alvation of all men in that day: for the wicked will then be condemned and mu&s;t &s;uffer unutterable pain and torment as they allow.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Salvation for all men, preface, p. 4. and p. 24.</NOTE> Their con&s;truction then is

excluded, confuted and wholly &s;et a&s;ide. I would next ob&s;erve, "this bowing" belongs to the con&s;titution of the kingdom of Chri&s;t in this world; as truly and fully as any other text in the book of God. This cannot be denied: con&s;equently, it mu&s;t and will have its accompli&s;hment in his di&s;pen&s;ation of the kingdom in this world, or in the &s;ettlement of it at the end of the world. For then every thing appertaining to his kingdom will be fulfilled, "and the mi&s;tery of God will be fini&s;hed." This cuts off and excludes their con&s;truction, intirely. To make the matter more plain, I ob&s;erve further; the text hath a &s;pecial reference to two grand, remarkable periods, in which it will have a literal and eminent fulfilment. The fir&s;t period is in the di&s;pen&s;ation of this kingdom in this world; in the in|gathering of all nations, even "the fullne&s;s of Jews and Gen|tiles" into it: "When the kingdoms of this world" by cordial &s;ubjection, &s;hall literally "become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t," Rev. 11.15. The call to "the ends of the earth, to look to him and be &s;aved," hath a pointed reference to this period: it will be &s;o exten&s;ively effectual, as that it may literally and with greate&s;t propriety be &s;aid "that every knee doth bow to him, and every tongue doth &s;wear" fealty and o|bedience to him: and &s;hall openly profe&s;s "in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength," v. 24. and an innumerable mul|titude no doubt will be &s;aved. "In the Lord &s;hall all the &s;eed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified, and &s;hall glory," v. 25. The other pe|riod, is the day of judgment, at the final &s;ettlement of the great affairs of his kingdom. This we &s;ee Paul expre&s;sly witne&s;&s;eth. Then all and every one, willing or unwilling mu&s;t bow, to his authority and &s;entence as &s;upreme Lord and Judge. The unwilling and di&s;obedient mu&s;t bow under the &s;entence and weight of his wrath. The &s;cripture very clearly gives us the key of this con&s;truction; but never once extends it beyond the day of judgment. In this way the text gives us important in|&s;truction and encouragement to bow in a cordial &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t in this world, that we may be &s;aved. And inforces the duty with a &s;olemn admonition and warning, that in ca&s;e we neglect it, we mu&s;t bow to his authority, power and &s;entence, and abide the tremendous, and eternal con&s;equence. But in their con&s;truction, the de&s;igned in&s;truction and admonition for
<PB N="124" REF="019737_0143_0FACA3FB28470130">
the good of the world, is lo&s;t. For this and many other rea&s;ons we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, reject it. Let the que&s;tion be put, Where is this bowing in the future &s;tate, required? where as a term of &s;alvation? where is there any promi&s;e made to it? there is none in the revelations of God: it is unknown in it. It is not that bowing by faith, that is the go&s;pel term of life; that is for this world "to &s;ave us from the wrath to come" and not tho&s;e who are in that &s;tate of mi&s;ery. Go&s;pel faith, e&s;&s;entially differs from that bowing to divine authority they &s;et up, in all re&s;pects. It differs as to &s;tate, &s;ubjects, worlds, and effects. Faith is for this &s;tate, that for the future: the &s;ubjects of the one, are &s;ub|jects of mercy, under a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy: the other "ve&s;|&s;els of wrath, fitted for de&s;truction, in a &s;tate of perdition:"&mdash; the one in this, the other in the world to come: and as different in effect. Faith brings glory to God, to his Son, to his autho|rity and grace: it "purifies the heart from dead works to &s;erve the living God" in this world: "it overcomes the world," &amp;c. but their bowing in the future &s;tate cannot po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer the grand purpo&s;es of faith, in this world. It brings no glory to God and his promi&s;es; doth no honor to Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel; brings no &s;ecurity to piety, to vertue and holine&s;s, and to the intere&s;t of the kingdom of God, in this world. It doth not e&s;tabli&s;h the law, nor the requi&s;itions of the go&s;pel, but makes both void. It cannot overcome the world, for it commences after the earth is peri&s;hed; and there is no world to overcome, in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e. Therefore, this bowing can overcome no|thing, but the whole go&s;pel con&s;titution, with its infinitely im|portant connexions; to which it is directly oppo&s;ed. For the plain language of it is,&mdash;God gives up to his enemies, his infi|nite authority and government as exerci&s;ed in this world: he makes the great &s;acrifice of the honor of it; and of all the re|qui&s;itions of law and go&s;pel in this &s;tate; and cancels all the threatnings and cur&s;es of his &s;acred book; then they bow and take &s;alvation. The &s;uppo&s;ition is big with bla&s;phemy and di&s;|honor, horror and ruin. 'Tis de&s;olation to the character, autho|rity and government of the infinite Jehovah: and it announces ab&s;olute ruin to the whole moral creation. For, this great &s;a|crifice once made, no foundation is left for the confidence, hope and happine&s;s of creatures, to re&s;t upon. This future bowing
<PB N="125" REF="019737_0144_0FACA3FBF08036C8">
is a doctrine of infinite reproach &amp; mi&s;chief, every way. What more ruinous to peri&s;hing &s;inners? while it promi&s;eth them redemption, it lulls them a&s;leep in a &s;tate of condemnation and wrath: while it promi&s;es them liberty and &s;alvation, it rivets the chains of bondage, corruption and mi&s;ery upon them; with a vain delu&s;ive expectation of a future bowing to effect it. It ca&s;ts the highe&s;t reproach upon the eternal judgment, by teach|ing, it will not be final to mankind; nor any manife&s;tation of retributive, vindictive ju&s;tice, again&s;t the objects of ju&s;tice, &amp;c. It is highly reproachful to the infinite maje&s;ty, truth and ju&s;tice of God. When to alarm a lo&s;t, &s;tupid world to their duty and &s;afety, he hath &s;o oft proclaimed it his prerogative and glory "Vengeance is mine, and I will recompen&s;e it:" Yet when the great day of vengeance is come; this doctrine teacheth, no vindictive wrath will be executed upon his enemies; no retri|butive ju&s;tice will be rendered to ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted for de&s;truction;&mdash;it is all "di&s;cipline" in earth and hell. But di&s;|cipline cannot be retribution; no more than light and dark|ne&s;s, black and white, can be the &s;ame. It is highly reproach|ful to the Saviour, teaching that he executes the office, and &s;ettles all the great affairs of his kingdom, as Judge; before he has fini&s;hed his work as a Saviour: After which we are told, "there is a great deal to be done," &amp;c. It doth indeed pre|tend to honor the grace of God and merit of the Saviour: but it ca&s;ts infinite reproach on both, as in&s;ufficient to &s;ave in this world, tho&s;e who are to be &s;aved, thereby: in&s;ufficient, to &s;ave them but by their per&s;onally enduring the future torment to make them a willing people. It is mo&s;t highly reproachful to the kingdom of Chri&s;t, with all the glorious apparatus of in|&s;titutions, means, privileges and advantages of it, accompanied with all the exertions of God and men to &s;ave men in this world. This doctrine teacheth, it all unnece&s;&s;ary; the whole might be &s;pared. This bowing, it &s;eems, will &s;ave them as &s;urely, effectually, and more exten&s;ively. In a word, it levels the go&s;pel and the divine religion taught in it, with the &s;uper|&s;titions of this world, and with no religion at all in point of nece&s;&s;ity in this world, to final &s;alvation. This bowing, it &s;eems, will &s;upply the want of the go&s;pel, and of all religion and vertue in this world, and &s;ave all that need &s;alvation, without it.&mdash;

Who now doth not &s;ee, that this doctrine in the natural opera|tion of it, is an outlet to all vertue and good; and an inlet to all wickedne&s;s to deluge the earth? and that it is mo&s;t &s;ubver|&s;ive of the good and happine&s;s of mankind, in time and eter|nity?

<P>We pa&s;s on to the 5th general propo&s;ition, viz. The doctrine of the future puni&s;hment we maintain in oppo&s;ition to their's was fully believed by the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian church, and by their in&s;pired teachers.</P>
<P>Our opponents, in tracing the antiquity of their doctrine to Clemens and Origin, tacitly conceed it was unprofe&s;&s;ed in the church of God until that period. Till then, the church of God, Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian, were in the undi&s;turbed profe&s;&s;ion of the common doctrine of the future puni&s;hment, we main|tain. We have po&s;itive evidence in the te&s;timony of Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Jo&s;ephus, two approved Jewi&s;h authors, who lived very near the time of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, that the Jews (the &s;adducees who denied any future &s;tate, excepted) believed and maintained the future puni&s;hment to be perpetual and e|ternal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The te&s;timony of the&s;e writers hath been repeatedly cited by the learned, as Dr. Prideau, Dr. Whitby, and lately particularly recited by Dr. Gordon in his doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation examined, pag. 82. to which the reader is referred.</NOTE> We know it is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the profe&s;&s;ed articles of their faith, viz. that "God is the rewarded of them that diligently &s;eek him," and "the avenger of the di&s;obedi|ent." They believed the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t; the future judgment, and a future &s;tate of retribution to the one and the other, and that devils and wicked men would never in|herit the mount Zion of God in heaven: and con&s;equently, to be con&s;i&s;tent, they mu&s;t believe their puni&s;hment to be as la&s;t|ing, as their exi&s;tence and immortality.</P>
<P>Again, when our Lord addre&s;&s;es &s;uch an home application of his doctrine to the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees, with repeated woes again&s;t them for their hypocri&s;y and wickedne&s;s, with an "how

can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell?" "ye &s;hall receive grea|ter damnation," &amp;c. Mar. 23.13, 14, 33, &amp;c. it is morally cer|tain, from their carping di&s;po&s;ition and their particular concern in &s;uch an application, that they would have excepted again&s;t his doctrine, could they have found any po&s;&s;ible room for it. Therefore, their profound &s;ilence upon this head, is a clear, tacit confe&s;&s;ion and &s;trong witne&s;s his general doctrine with all its everla&s;ting terrors, was agreeable to their public faith, how much &s;oever they di&s;liked the pointed application.</P>
<P>Further, it is well known the Jews maintained, that &s;inners of the Gentiles living and dying in idolatry, without the know|ledge of the true God, would be utterly and finally lo&s;t, to &s;al|vation and hope. And in this &s;en&s;e, familiar to the Jews and di&s;ciples, our Lord &s;peaks of Judas as "lo&s;t:" &s;tiles him "the &s;on of perdition," denoting him an heir of and con&s;igned to perdition, as before noted. Paul taught, and the chri&s;tian church believed, this &s;ame doctrine with the Jews; that "Ido|laters &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God," 1 Cor. 6.9. that idolatrous gentiles, continuing in that &s;tate, are "without God" and "hope" of his &s;alvation, Eph. 2.12. that unbelievers under the go&s;pel are in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e "lo&s;t": "but if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To evade the force of all this, it is &s;aid, "yet the Son of Man came to &s;eek and to &s;ave them who were lo&s;t." "He came, not to call the righ|teous, but &s;inners to repentance," &s;ee &s;ome deductions from the &s;y&s;tem of revelation, p. 18. and what then? The inference de&s;igned is, "that all that our Saviour and his apo&s;tles repre&s;ent as lo&s;t, and all the impenitent &s;hall be &s;aved." Never wor&s;e logic and divinity. Our Saviour has taught us the way in which only he will &s;ave them who were lo&s;t. "He that be|lieveth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." He not only calls &s;inners to repentance, but inforces the duty with certain perdition to the impenitent. "Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h." Now will he in the day of judgment, or in any future period, gain&s;ay this doctrine, which he taught on earth? and &s;ay to the finally impenitent and unbelieving, "ye &s;hall not peri&s;h and be damned, but &s;hall be &s;aved? Will any but a thoro' placed infidel affirm it? and yet if he doth not &s;o gain&s;ay it, they are forever lo&s;t, and cannot be &s;aved; and the de&s;igned inference is de&s;troyed.</NOTE> in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not," 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. that Paul had no hope of the &s;alvation of any, but tho&s;e who entertained the go&s;pel faith in this world, is evident, from his great anxiety for the Jews that they might "believe and be

&s;aved:" from his great and ardent labours, "if by any means he might &s;ave &s;ome of them," Rom. 11.14. 1 Cor. 9.22. and from his expre&s;s declaration, that the di&s;obedient to the go&s;pel &s;hould "be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction," 2 The&s;. 1.8, 9. Moreover, there is one article of faith, in which the jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian church were united; which is deci&s;ive, viz. that no one can ever be &s;aved but in compliance with the terms of life, appointed of God to men, in this &s;tate. This &s;eems evident, in the que&s;tion re&s;pecting circumci&s;ion agitated by the apo&s;tles and primitive church at Jeru&s;alem, as recorded in the 15th chap. of Acts. The judaizing teachers and chri&s;tians maintained, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of circumci&s;ion to &s;alvation. They taught "except ye be circumci&s;ed after the manner of Mo&s;es, ye cannot be &s;aved," ver. 1. The &s;imple que&s;tion in di&s;pute was, whether circumci&s;ion and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ritual of the law of Mo&s;es, was an e&s;&s;ential term of &s;alvation under the go&s;pel, or not. This fully implies, their unanimous agreement in this principle, viz. "That the terms of &s;alvation appointed of God to men in this world, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be complied with; and that no one under advantage for it, could ever be &s;aved without it. For if no terms were e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, or if all men might be &s;aved in the future world without complying with any terms in this; the que&s;tion whe|ther circumci&s;ion was nece&s;&s;ary, and they could not be &s;aved without it; was idle, futile, and very ab&s;urd. Surely it is in|credible, that the chri&s;tian church, with thy in&s;pired apo&s;tles at their head, accompanied with the &s;uperintending influences of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;hould be concerned, in the deci&s;ion of a que&s;tion which in reality had no foundation for it. The &s;up|po&s;ition carries the highe&s;t reflection of di&s;honour in it. The conclu&s;ion therefore, forces it&s;elf upon us "that it was the u|nited faith of the jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian church, and their in&s;pired teachers, that of nece&s;&s;ity we mu&s;t comply with the appointed terms of life in this world, or never &s;ee and enjoy the &s;alvation of God." The con&s;equence is clear, the final neglectors of &s;alvation cannot be &s;aved, but mu&s;t be mi&s;erable throughout their exi&s;tence. And what need we more? we have the faith once delivered to, and actually embraced by the &s;aints of God: the faith of the apo&s;tolic church, built upon the apo&s;tles and
<PB N="129" REF="019737_0148_0FACA3FEF9E7DA40">
prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the chief corner &s;tone; which we are told is the pillar and ground of truth. We know no other rule of faith; here we are &s;afe, and no where el&s;e. I &s;ubjoin but one remark: All the arguments of our opponents from &s;cripture, mu&s;t be from mi&s;take and mi&s;con&s;truction of the &s;acred texts: for the in&s;pired penmen, and particularly Paul, never believed their doctrine, but the contrary: which he and they taught, and the church of God received from them. They never taught, that all the unbelieving and di&s;obedient of this world &s;hould be &s;aved in that which is future, "by bowing to the authority of God," becau&s;e it is contrary to their unanimous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">th, as hath now been evinced. They never taught but one doctrine of &s;alvation as heretofore illu&s;trated; and but one way to obtain it, by a cordial compliance with the go&s;pel terms of life in this &s;tate and world: by which, as the rule of judgment, the &s;tates of men will be deci&s;ively and finally determined, in the day of judgment.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">From this principle, and many other ways, it is evident, the jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian church did not believe in two manners of &s;alvation; one for the elect and &s;anctified in the re&s;urrection and day of judgment; the other for the un&s;anctified non-elect, afterwards. It is directly oppo&s;ite to this article of their faith, and the current of &s;cripture. Nor did they believe in their patch-work doctrine of a world to come and next &s;tate, not eternal, con&s;i&s;ting of ages of ages taken off from eternity and the admini&s;tration of God when all in all; and &s;omehow tacked on to time, after "time &s;hall be no more," in which the Saviour, when he hath long before executed his work as a judge, &s;hall compleat his work as a Saviour. The&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic dreams, of vi&s;ionary, theoretic dreamers, have &s;tarted forth into the world long enough &s;ince the days of in&s;piration, and appear as much unknown and di&s;regarded by the church of God, in the days of in&s;piration, as the wild reveries of the Elect Lady in the north of us.</NOTE></P>
<P>This brings us to the 6th and la&s;t propo&s;ition, viz. to &s;hew that the doctrine of the la&s;t, the eternal judgment &s;et forth in the word of God, and particularly by our Saviour and his apo|&s;tles, is deci&s;ive of this controver&s;y; that the &s;entence and pu|ni&s;hment of the wicked will be eternal.</P>
<P>Is not the day of judgment purpo&s;ely appointed, to adju&s;t and &s;ettle the all-important affairs of God's moral kingdom, for eternity? If &s;o, the deci&s;ion will be final, and the contro|ver&s;y is at an end. The deci&s;ions of that day as final and for eternity, or as temporary, makes a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference in the &s;y&s;tem of revelation, and in the practical influence of the
<PB N="130" REF="019737_0149_0FACA3FFABDA8C18">
doctrine upon mankind; and therefore highly merits attention. That there will be &s;uch a final &s;ettlement, in which the king|dom of God will &s;hine forth in eternal perfection and glory; &s;eems a clear dictate of rea&s;on and &s;cripture. And when to be effected, if not in the great day of univer&s;al judgment? They admit there will be &s;uch a &s;ettlement, but &s;ay not at that period. For "there will be a great deal to be done after the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t," &amp;c. If &s;o, it &s;eems, the &s;ettlement of this great kingdom our Lord will then make, will be partial and imperfect: he fini&s;hes the di&s;pen&s;ation of his kingdom before he hath compleated his &s;aving work: and he executes his of|fice of judge, before he has fini&s;hed his work as a Saviour; and before matters are prepared for a final &s;entence and deci&s;ion of the &s;tates of multitudes, who are to be judged by him. How irrational, un&s;criptural and di&s;honorary is all this? The ab&s;ur|dity of that tenet is &s;o glaring, at fir&s;t view, that a few hints will be &s;ufficient to evince and fix the true doctrine.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered&mdash;the tenor of revelation teacheth, this &s;tate of mankind is introductory to one that is eternal:&mdash; this, a &s;tate of di&s;cipline; that, of retribution; that the day of judgment is certainly appointed to decide and &s;ettle the &s;tates of all men, good and bad, for the world to come: that then in fact, the righteous will be adjudged "to life eternal" and the wicked "to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment;" and the belief of that deci&s;ion as final and unalterable to them, is the grand &s;upport of the faith, hope, con&s;tancy and fidelity of the godly in all ages; and that the hopes and fears of all men are every where terminated in the deci&s;ions of that day and no other&mdash;"by thy words thou &s;halt be ju&s;tified, or by thy words thou &s;halt be condemned," "the word that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him in the la&s;t day," is the doctrine of Chri&s;t. Paul prays for his friend and benefactor One&s;iphorus, "that he might find mercy of the Lord in that day:" and Jude teaches us "to keep our&s;elves in the love of God," in that way "look|ing for the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal life." But not a &s;ingle in&s;truction in the book of God, to look for mercy after the deci&s;ion of that day. Who that views the con|curring evidence and force of all this, can doubt, the deci&s;ion of that day will be final? Again, the grand de&s;criptions of
<PB N="131" REF="019737_0150_0FACA4009AFCA160">
the day of judgment, with the infinitely important tran&s;actions and de&s;igns of it, clearly indicate it, final. When all nations and the whole moral world &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled before Chri&s;t&mdash; &s;hall render their account at his bar&mdash;the character and &s;tates of all be fixed by him: &s;entence and execution &s;hall pa&s;s upon all univer&s;ally, both the righteous and wicked:&mdash;What more can be requi&s;ite, to a compleat, final &s;ettlement, of the &s;tates of all men, and the whole moral world? And what can be the meaning of this inconceiveably grand a&s;&s;emblage of the whole moral world, and proce&s;s of the eternal Judge, if it be not final and for eternity? Further, the heavens will reveal Chri&s;t in that day, for the re&s;titution &amp; regulation of "all things &s;poken of by all the prophets,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts 31.21.</NOTE> which remain to be regulated. And when he hath fini&s;hed his work, adju&s;ted &amp; regulated all things &s;poken of in revelation, there can be no more to be done, ac|cording to &s;cripture: it is final and for eternity. Again, Chri&s;t will then come in his glory, and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels of &s;et purpo&s;e, to rai&s;e the dead, judge the world, &s;ettle the kingdom of God, and to be glorified as Savi|our and Judge, in a manner as never before or afterwards. We &s;urely conclude, he will then execute &s;uch an all-important work, as never was before and never will be repeated: that the &s;tates of all that are judged, will be finally fixed; and the king|dom of God will be &s;ettled finally and in highe&s;t perfection and glory; to be adequate and an&s;werable to &s;uch an appearance and de&s;ign. Can a partial, imperfect &s;ettlement be adequate and an&s;werable to &s;uch an infinitely magnificent appearance, and to a de&s;ign corre&s;ponding to, and worthy of it? Doth the &s;pirit of in&s;piration arre&s;t the attention of the church and world of mankind, to look for no more, than &s;uch a work, at his coming? Will &s;aints and angels behold no more than this par|tial, temporary work, in the fini&s;hing of his kingdom, in that great day, for which to glorify the adorable Immanuel? Who can believe it? It is al&s;o to be noted, it is the day of the pub|lic manife&s;tations of the &s;ons of God in their glory, as never before or afterwards; and the day of vengeance of our God a|gain&s;t his enemies: the great day to magnify his word and illu&s;trate the promi&s;es and threatnings of it in the cleare&s;t and

&s;tronge&s;t light: to reveal and manife&s;t his righteou&s;ne&s;s; to vindicate his authority and government, and to di&s;play the glory of his moral character and government, in the open view of the univer&s;e. This done, what more can be needful? Yea, what more can be done, to &s;ettle the all-important affairs of his kingdom in the highe&s;t perfection conceivable, for eternity? and we repeat the que&s;tion, When will it be effected, if not in that great day? In&s;piration gives us a prophetic view of the grand &s;cenes of providence, to take place to the end of the world, and of the unutterably grand &s;ettlement of the kingdom of God and the &s;tates of the moral world in the day of judg|ment: but if this, be not final; it gives us no intimation of the time and manner in which the final &s;ettlement for eternity, by far the mo&s;t important of all, is to be made. This &s;urely is a mo&s;t dark and incredible affair. It is admitted, the &s;tates of the righteous will be then fixed for eternity: and why not of the wicked, likewi&s;e? when there is one judge, one day ap|pointed, and one and the &s;ame rule, for both. Add to this, the &s;cripture no where teach, that he will ever &s;ettle the &s;tate of the finally di&s;obedient in a retribution of mercy; nor any rule given whereby they ever can be adjudged, to eternal life: but in every account of it by our Saviour and all the apo&s;tles, particularly Paul and John, it will be &s;ettled in a di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;trict, retributive ju&s;tice and vindictive wrath. Our Lord will &s;ay to the wicked, "depart ye cur&s;ed," and "the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment," as he teacheth us, 25th Mat. St. Paul exhibits the ground and whole proce&s;s of the day of judgment again&s;t the di&s;obedient, upon the footing of &s;trict, impartial, retributive ju&s;tice. "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompen&s;e tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, re&s;t with us." Here is the righteous ground of it. He proceeds to de&s;cribe the manner of his coming, corre&s;ponding with the de&s;ign of it, in the &s;tronge&s;t language of vindictive wrath "when the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven, in flaming fire," this is the man|ner of his appearance, "taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. 1.5, to the 10th.</NOTE>

this is the work he will execute. St. John teaches, after the judgment "who&s;oever were not found written in the book of life, were ca&s;t into the lake of fire," Rev. 20.15. Now, we read of no mercy for them, no rever&s;al of this judgment, no other deci&s;ion of their &s;tates for eternity: and it being &s;o writ|ten and left, plainly &s;hews it final, and for eternity.</P>
<P>Moreover, every general de&s;cription of the future judgment with its re&s;ult and con&s;equences, exhibit it, as a final &s;ettlement of the &s;tates of all, good and bad. The prophet Malachi re|pre&s;ents it, "the day of God's making up his jewels" for ever|la&s;ting glory: when there will be a perfect, final divi&s;ion made "between the righteous and the wicked," "him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mal. 3.17, 18.</NOTE> And what is the con|&s;equence? "all the wicked &s;hall be burnt up, as an oven."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">ch. 4. v. 1.</NOTE> Is not this final to them? John the Bapti&s;t a&s;&s;ures us "Chri&s;t will thoro'ly purge his floor, gather the wheat into his garner, and burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire? Can any figure more &s;trongly repre&s;ent, a final &s;ettlement? Is not the divi&s;ion perfect, between the righteous and the wicked, intended by the wheat and chaff? and is not the work as fini&s;hed for the chaff, the wicked, when "burnt up with unquenchable fire" as for the righteous? we have &s;een that our Saviour in a variety of parables teacheth us, that at the end of the world, "he will come and &s;ettle the great affairs of his kingdom, by making a perfect &s;eparation between his &s;ubjects according to character, "between good and bad, the ju&s;t and unju&s;t," accompanied with a full retribution, and clo&s;ed with everla&s;ting &s;entences on the righteous and on the wicked. If this doth not clearly and &s;trongly evince it a final &s;ettlement of their &s;tates for eternity, what words, what de&s;cription can do it? One thing more merits attention, the peculiar epithets and empha&s;is put upon the future judgment, indicates it final. It is frequently &s;tiled "the la&s;t day:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.39, 40, 44, 45. &amp; ch. 11.24. &amp; ch. 12.48.</NOTE> and the grand works appropriated to it are, the univer&s;al re&s;urrection, and univer&s;al judgment and deci&s;ion of the &s;tates of the whole moral world. Now as there will be no re&s;urrection of the dead, after that period, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to conclude, there will be no more judgment; and that no one will be adjudged to eternal life, after that day. It is
<PB N="134" REF="019737_0153_0FACA4036DC3DDB8">
repeatedly de&s;cribed as "that day" by way of empha&s;is, to denote it the mo&s;t important day that ever will be. But if the moral kingdom of God, and the &s;tates of all men, will not be finally &s;ettled for eternity at that period, whence this empha&s;is? where is the propriety of it? It is de&s;cribed, as "the eternal judgment:" thus it was taught by the apo&s;tles, and &s;o it was received by the chri&s;tian church and as a "fir&s;t principle of the chri&s;tian faith:" "Therefore leaving the fir&s;t principles of the doctrine of Chri&s;t," &amp;c. "of the re&s;urrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment," Heb. 6.1, 2. but why was it &s;o taught and &s;o received, if the deci&s;ion and &s;entences of that day, be not final and for eternity? Is it not a glaring contradiction, to &s;ay, there will be a judgment after "the la&s;t" and that which is "eternal?" Why &s;hould not this convince and &s;atisfy every one, &s;ince all the de&s;criptions of the future judgment uniformly and deci&s;ively &s;peak the &s;ame doctrine; and there is no intima|tion in revelation of a judgment, alteration, or another deci&s;i|on, after that great day of the Lord. Still dreaming theori&s;ts would fancy another day, and &s;ettlement: but they are preclu|ded by the te&s;timony of God. "For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son," Joh. 5.22. "The Son will execute the office of judge, the power of judg|ment, and fini&s;h the work of judgment, in the "la&s;t day;" and then give up the kingdom and commi&s;&s;ion of Judge unto the Father, and "God will be all in all," in admini&s;tration thro' out eternity. An impartial mind may &s;ee this clearly taught 1 Cor. 15.24, to 29. We have before tran&s;cribed the para|graph at large and ob&s;erved, that "the coming of Chri&s;t," "the re&s;urrection," "the end," "the putting down all enemies, and &s;ubdual of all things unto him," "the delivering up the king|dom," "the Son him&s;elf &s;ubject," and "God all in all," are all &s;et forth, as coeval, cotemporary events to take place toge|ther in the grand period of the la&s;t day: and doth clearly e|vince the all-important &s;ettlement then made; final, and for eternity. How can it be otherwi&s;e, when the di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t's kingdom is at an end? and there is neither judge&mdash; tribunal&mdash;nor day appointed, for any after audit and judg|ment? the &s;pirit of in&s;piration hath connected the&s;e grand events together, nor can they be &s;evered and di&s;connected,

without un&s;criptural pre&s;umption and violence. Upon the whole, we find not a &s;yllable in &s;cripture upon this &s;ubject, a|gain&s;t it: but from all the de&s;criptions given of it, we have e|very rea&s;on to confide in it, as an undoubted truth, "that the day of judgment is purpo&s;ely appointed to adju&s;t and &s;ettle the all-important affairs of the kingdom of God and of Chri&s;t, and the &s;tates of all mankind, for eternity; and was accordingly taught and believed by the apo&s;tles and primitive church, to be "the eternal judgment," and as &s;uch received as "a fir&s;t prin|ciple" of the chri&s;tian faith. The conclu&s;ion is irre&s;i&s;table&mdash; the &s;entence both upon the righteous and wicked to comport with this grand de&s;ign, mu&s;t be "eternal." That day is de|&s;igned to reveal and manife&s;t the righteous judgment of God, in a retributive ju&s;tice and puni&s;hment to the wicked, accord|ing to the demerit of their &s;ins, which is eternal death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6. la&s;t ver.</NOTE> The &s;entence and puni&s;hment awarded in that day, will perfectly agree with all the imported, figurative and literal de&s;criptions of it throughout revelation; which we have &s;hewn, uniformly teach it without end, and eternal.

The go&s;pel con&s;titution, promi&s;es, threatnings and rule of judgment are all unchangeable, and will abide forever. Therefore the &s;entence of condemnation in that day, mu&s;t be eternal; it being impo&s;&s;ible they can ever be de|clared ju&s;t, by the &s;ame con&s;titution &amp; rule of judgment, which condemns them. The ground of the future &s;entence, things done in the body in this life, is unalterable and unchangeable: of cour&s;e, a righteous &s;entence upon it, mu&s;t be irrever&s;ible and eternal: ina&s;much as the ground and rule upon which it is pa&s;&s;ed, will remain everla&s;tingly the &s;ame.&mdash;A puni&s;hment, to an&s;wer the grand purpo&s;e of a full, everla&s;ting vindication of the character, authority and government of God, and to &s;et|tle his kingdom in eternal peace, &s;ecurity, dignity and glory; we have before &s;hewn, mu&s;t be eternal.

Let it be con&s;idered, when our Lord is revealed in his immen&s;e maje&s;ty and glory on the throne of judgment, no one doubts, he will fully &s;upport the dignity and glory of his cha|racter, as judge. From which we infer, "the words in this &s;entence are mo&s;t clear, unambiguous and deci&s;ive." For it is incon&s;i&s;tent with all propriety, decorum and dignity in a judge, to announce a capital &s;entence in any other words, but what are familiar and of a determinate meaning. The &s;ame word, therefore, in the &s;ame &s;entence, mu&s;t have determinately the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and meaning. This word "everla&s;ting" as de&s;crip|tive of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, and of the devil and his angels, mu&s;t have the &s;ame meaning to both. This &s;ame word, in the &s;ame &s;entence, contra&s;ting the duration of the puni&s;hment of the wicked, with the life and happine&s;s of the righteous, mu&s;t deci&s;ively point out the &s;ame duration to both. To &s;uppo&s;e, our Lord means to point out a temporary puni&s;hment to the wicked, and an everla&s;ting happine&s;s to the righteous, by one and the &s;ame word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who know the original, know the &s;ame adjective is u&s;ed in each part of the de&s;cription.</NOTE> in the &s;ame &s;entence, is to &s;uppo&s;e him to u&s;e it with &s;uch amazing ambiguity, impropriety and indeco|rum, as no earthly judge would be guilty of, in a capital &s;en|tence. Far be &s;uch an imputation from the Judge of all worlds. This &s;entence was given by our Lord, and is written to a&s;&s;ure the world how he will &s;ettle the &s;tates of all men, good and bad in the day of judgment, for eternity. And we have ju&s;t the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance in it, that the puni&s;hment of the wicked will be &s;trictly "everla&s;ting" as we have of the life and happine&s;s of the righteous. Again, upon this ground of con&s;truction, puni&s;h|ment is to be under&s;tood, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of "retributive ju&s;tice," and the word "eternal" mu&s;t be taken in that &s;en&s;e in which it would be mo&s;t ea&s;ily and naturally under&s;tood by the Jews and di&s;ciples. And by the u&s;e and repetition of this term of duration, our Lord de&s;igns deci&s;ively, to determine the du|ration

It is a puni&s;hment in the future, invi&s;ible &s;tate, and this word that de&s;cribes the duration of it, mu&s;t naturally be under&s;tood in that &s;en&s;e in which it is u&s;ed, to de&s;cribe the things of the future and invi&s;ible world; which is "the never ending &s;en&s;e:" "the things which are &s;een are temporary, but the things which are not &s;een are eternal."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.18.</NOTE> We mu&s;t doubtle&s;s under&s;tand it, according to the invariable u&s;e of it (i.e.) to be as la&s;ting as the nature and con&s;titution of the things, to which it is applied: being here applied to beings by nature and con&s;titution immor|tal, in an eternal &s;tate; the &s;entence to the righteous and to the wicked mu&s;t be &s;trictly, eternal. The di&s;ciples would natu|rally, yea nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tand it, in the &s;en&s;e taught by the prophets, commonly believed by the Jews, in which they had been educated, and which had been repeatedly confirmed by our Lord, which is &s;trictly eternal. And our Saviour doubtle&s;s de&s;igned it in this &s;en&s;e, in which they would naturally receive it; to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, would be a direct impeachment of his integrity as a teacher, and to di&s;honour him as a judge. More|over, he hath de&s;ignedly and deci&s;ively fixed the duration of the future puni&s;hment, by way of connexion and contra&s;t: it will be as la&s;ting, as "the fire," "the everla&s;ting one prepared for the devil and his angels," with which it is connected; and as la&s;ting, as "the eternal life of the righteous," with which it is contra&s;ted. For why is this word u&s;ed? why, in this connxi|on, and with &s;uch repetition, but to fix the duration of it? and how is it po&s;&s;ible to be more clearly and &s;trongly fixed, in &s;o few words? This mu&s;t be deci&s;ive and determine the contro|ver&s;y. Critici&s;m upon a word in &s;uch a ca&s;e, avails nothing. When the nature, the grand de&s;ign, the con&s;titution and rule of judgment, the grounds of the &s;entence, and the ends of this infinitely important tran&s;action in the la&s;t day, are all con&s;ider|ed, with the deci&s;ive language and manner of the &s;entence, by connexion and contra&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible the apo&s;tles could un|der&s;tand the puni&s;hment of a limited period; which, it is pro|bable they had never heard of. The word "eternal," placed in &s;uch variety of &s;trong connexions, is as determinately fixed, as
<PB N="138" REF="019737_0157_0FACA40674D13D80">
is perhaps po&s;&s;ible for a word to be: and this &s;entence &s;o clear, unambiguous and deci&s;ive (than which perhaps no capital &s;en|rence was ever more &s;o) will do honour to the eternal Judge. It precludes all cavil and critici&s;m, and mocks it with defiance. Indeed, there is &s;omething extremely indelicate, incongruous and ab&s;urd, in critici&s;ing the words of a capital &s;entence, to &s;et a&s;ide the &s;pirit and energy of it. Becau&s;e, from the nature of the thing, they are always &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t plain, clear and determinate. Suppo&s;e one of the carpers of this world, &s;hould critici&s;e the word "death" in a capital &s;entence pro|nounced upon a murderer: he addre&s;&s;es the criminal, with the great mercy of the government which forbid the execution: tells him, &s;uch violent execution &s;hocks humanity with its hor|ror, and our rea&s;on with its incredibility, "it exceeds belief:" and to &s;ooth his fears, adds, You mu&s;t note the word "death" is ambiguous, and certainly u&s;ed in a variety of different con|&s;tructions in &s;cripture, and in common language; and there|fore is doubtful, as connected in the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon you: &s;ometimes it means natural death, &s;ometimes tho' &s;eldom, a violent death, at other times moral death, &s;ome times neither of the&s;e, but only the fear and danger of death: "in deaths oft" &s;ays Paul: not that he often died, but was oft in fear and danger of it: &s;o the &s;entence may put you in fear and danger, and not be literally executed: or, it may mean death in law, that you &s;hall be an outlawry and &s;uffer lo&s;s and damage by it; and this may in part be the meaning of it. But there is ano|ther, a modern &s;en&s;e, which (altho' unknown in &s;cripture and to all the con&s;titutions of the world) is yet the true &s;en&s;e, viz. "that the murder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, the wickedne&s;s it&s;elf, and what of the evil &s;pirit blending with you in&s;tigated to it, &s;hall literally be hang|ed&punc; but you per&s;onally, &s;oul and body, &s;hall &s;lip through the rope, and &s;hall be compleatly &s;aved alive." Would not every man of common &s;en&s;e, reprobate &s;uch an unnatural, barbarous kind of critici&s;m, as a &s;hocking, abu&s;ive impo&s;ition on the pri|&s;oner, and the highe&s;t indignity offered to the judge? And is not the impo&s;ition upon peri&s;hing immortals, and the indignity offered to the &s;upreme and eternal Judge in the &s;ubject before us, beyond all conception greater, and more dete&s;tible? Verily, it appears &s;o horribly impious, to attempt to critici&s;e away the

terrors of the la&s;t, the eternal judgment, and of that deci&s;ive &s;entence, the mo&s;t tremendous that ever was or will be pro|nounced in the univer&s;e, as well may make one's heart and fle&s;h to tremble.</P>
<P>We have now exhibited the proofs propo&s;ed, and tru&s;t it is made deci&s;ively clear and evident under each propo&s;ition, and particularly the la&s;t; that the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, as literally de&s;cribed in the text, will be &s;trictly for ever and ever&mdash;perpetual, and without end. If the future judgment be final, the &s;entence is irrever&s;ible, and it is impo&s;&s;ible the con|demned in that day &s;hould ever be &s;aved. And it behoves us, to realize the certainty, the great practical de&s;ign, and eternal importance of the doctrine, that hath been illu&s;trated. How loudly doth it admoni&s;h the world of mankind, to &s;tand in awe and &s;in not? what more forcible argument to repentance can be adduced, than that of the future judgment, with its eternal con&s;equences, as addre&s;&s;ed by Paul to governor Felix, and the re&s;t of his illu&s;trious audience? well may &s;inners on the brink of this everla&s;ting de&s;truction, tremble like Felix, at the thoughts of continuing in &s;uch a fearful condition, adore God for his pa|tience, and be led to repentance by the riches of his goodne&s;s. With what readine&s;s of heart and adoring gratitude, &s;hould we embrace the offer of life and &s;alvation in Chri&s;t? For, the eternal importance of his redemption may be &s;een and read of all men, in the greatne&s;s and eternal pains and terrors, from which, it de|livers all who believe and obey him. Surely, it ought to be exceedingly important and precious in our eyes. Well may the happy &s;ubjects of it rejoice in the beginnings of it, and lift up their heads with joy at the approach of the great day, when their redemption &s;hall be compleat, and they put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the eternal inheritance. The great day is coming, which will cer|tainly decide our &s;tates, for eternity: and it is ju&s;t as certain, that that everla&s;ting life or death await us in the coming world, as that the future judgment is final. And what can more for|cibly warn us, not to neglect &s;o great &s;alvation; and quicken us to ha&s;ten our preparation for the coming and kingdom of the Lord. The evidence produced may be further &s;trength|ned, and the &s;ubject appear &s;till more clear, when the arguments of our opponents from &s;cripture texts, and their eva&s;ions are con&s;idered and confuted, in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>PROPOSITION III. Chri&s;t died, not for a &s;elect number of men only, but for mankind univer&s;ally, and without exception or limitation. The author alledges in proof the texts which &s;peak of Chri&s;t's dying "for us" "for our &s;ins" "for &s;inners" "for the ungodly" "for the unju&s;t" and as "the lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world" and "hath made propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for us only, but the whole world, "who gave his life a ran&s;om for all" and "ta&s;ted death for every man." And further adds, as though it were on purpo&s;e to prevent a mi&s;conception of this exten&s;ive de&s;ign of his death, he commi&s;|&s;ioned his apo&s;tles, and &s;ent them forth "to preach repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, through his name, to all nations, "yea, to every rea&s;onable creature under heaven," which he infers could not con&s;i&s;tently be done, if in virtue of his death, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and eternal life, had not been attainable by all the &s;ons of men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the &s;alvation of all men the &s;cheme of God. Printed in London, 1784, p. 20, 21.</NOTE> The true inference is, that remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and eter|nal life are attainable by all the &s;ons of men, in the way of faith in Chri&s;t, and repentance towards God, in this life: upon the exerci&s;e of which, it is a&s;certained unto them. This comports with the de&s;ign of the&s;e texts; and &s;tates the de&s;ign of the death of Chri&s;t in its true extent and ju&s;t limitation. The go&s;pel com|mi&s;&s;ion is produced, as teaching "the exten&s;ive de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's death" with &s;uch preci&s;ion "as to prevent mi&s;con&s;truction." It is fatal to their &s;cheme: for, the apo&s;tles were to teach faith and repentance, in their connexion with remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins and eternal life, as attainable by the &s;ons of men in this life, only. This doctrine they were to preach to all "the living nations of the earth; and as opportunity pre&s;ented, to every humane crea|ture

in them, under heaven:" but not to the dead, who died in their &s;ins&mdash;not to any in future torment: con&s;equently, the &s;alvation of all the&s;e, is not attainable; they are excluded out of the commi&s;&s;ion, and from the de&s;ign of this death, as pre|ci&s;ely and deci&s;ively taught in it. They are neither included in the commi&s;&s;ion, nor in a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in revelation, as tho&s;e who are to be &s;aved by the ran&s;om of Chri&s;t. The meaning of the&s;e texts is very ea&s;y, if we take this commi&s;&s;ion, or the go&s;pel con&s;titution for the key of their con&s;truction, as we ought to do. Thus 1 Joh. 2.2. "He is the propitiation for our &s;ins (who are believers) and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the whole world:" &s;o that by becoming believers, they, as well as we, &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be &s;aved by it. We have before &s;hewn, that the univer&s;al terms of the go&s;pel proclamation, exhibiting the fulne&s;s of the provi&s;ion made for the &s;alvation of men, mu&s;t be limited by the terms of mercy and life &s;et forth in it; which de&s;ignedly di&s;criminate the &s;ubjects of actual, final &s;alvation. So our Saviour taught, notwith&s;tanding the provi&s;ion made, and invitation given, is in the fule&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t terms, "be|hold, all things are now ready," "who&s;oever will may come." Yet tho&s;e who refu&s;e the invitation &amp; neglect the go&s;pel terms of life "&s;hall never ta&s;te of his &s;upper." "Chri&s;t hath ta&s;ted death for every man," that who&s;oever believeth on him thro" the world, &s;hall be &s;aved, and yet actual &s;alvation will never be extended to any but the believing and &s;anctified in this world. That this is the genuine meaning and con&s;truction of the&s;e texts, &s;eems very evident by the&s;e &s;hort arguments. (1.) Actual &s;alvation cannot be extended beyond the de&s;ign of God, in providing the Saviour and &s;etting forth this propitiation; which is limited to tho&s;e who believe, Joh. 3.16. "For God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." (2dly.) Actual &s;alvation cannot extend beyond the intention of Chri&s;t in giving this ran&s;om, which is limited to the &s;anctified in this world. "Who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might re|deem us from all iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar peo|ple, zealous of good works," Tit. 2.14. (3dly.) It cannot extend beyond the grace of God, given in pur&s;uance of it, and to render it effectual. But this grace of God which brings
<PB N="142" REF="019737_0161_0FACA4096DEC2A20">
&s;alvation, teaches the only way to it, "by denying all ungodli|ne&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world," Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. (4thly.) Salvation cannot be extended beyond the interce&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;t, which are founded on this ran&s;om and atonement. Now our Saviour tells us expre&s;sly, he prays not for the unbelieving world, Joh. 17.9. but his interce&s;&s;ions are for all who believe in all ages of the world, v. 20. and it is for tho&s;e who come unto God by him, Heb. 7.25. nor is there an in&s;tance of his interce&s;&s;ion, for any who die in their &s;ins. (5thly.) Salvation cannot be extended to tho&s;e who make the death of Chri&s;t vain, in the grand intention of it, in this world. Paul te&s;tifies "Chri&s;t &s;hall profit them nothing," Gal. 5.2. In a word, the con|&s;truction of the&s;e texts is &s;o limited, "that by the con&s;titution of grace founded upon his death and ran&s;om, faith in Chri&s;t always was, now is, and always will be, the only way of life for &s;inful man." This mu&s;t &s;ettle the meaning of tho&s;e texts fin|ally, to the overthrow of the doctrine "that all men &s;hall be &s;aved." Ina&s;much as the intention of them is &s;o expre&s;sly poin|ted out, and the final efficacy of them &s;o deci&s;ively de&s;cribed and limited. For no one will be &s;o hardy as to affirm, that all the unbelieving and di&s;obedient world will be &s;aved, be&s;ide and beyond the intention of the God of &s;alvation, and without and beyond the interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and beyond the intention of his death likewi&s;e&mdash;and be&s;ide, and in &s;ubver&s;ion of the con|&s;titution of grace and mercy it&s;elf, whereby any can be &s;aved.</P>
<P>His general remark is, "If Chri&s;t died for all, his &s;cheme perfectly falls in with the great de&s;ign of his death." It doth not, if it be de&s;igned to open the door of &s;alvation to all, upon the &s;ame terms, and to &s;ecure &s;alvation to the believing and &s;anctified in this life, only, as has been proved. In extending &s;alvation to the finally di&s;obedient, it is in direct oppo&s;ition to the declared de&s;ign of the Father and the Son, in it, in the texts we have alledged. It is very evident in the&s;e texts, that it is de&s;igned to bring men to faith, repentance and go&s;pel holine&s;s in this world, and to limit &s;alvation by it, to the &s;anctified in this world. He adds, "it is far more rea&s;onable to believe that the whole humane kind, in con&s;equence of his death, will finally be &s;aved, than that the greater part of them &s;hould peri&s;h."
<PB N="143" REF="019737_0162_0FACA40A30238838">
Not, if the greater part be unbelieving and di&s;obedient, and as &s;uch are excluded by the con&s;titution of grace and mercy it&s;elf: e&s;pecially, as this con&s;titution is adapted in infinite wi&s;dom to &s;upport the authority and government of God, and to illu&s;trate his moral character and perfections and the honour of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in highe&s;t glory, and for the greate&s;t good of man|kind in this world and world to come, in the method of &s;alva|tion pre&s;cribed in it. It is further added, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 22.</NOTE> "more honour is hereby reflected on God, and greater vertue attributed to the blood of Chri&s;t" on his &s;cheme. How? Is it more honourable in the &s;upreme Jehovah, to give up his authority, law, go&s;pel and government in this world, to his enemies, than to &s;upport and illu&s;trate it in all its energy and glory? Is it honourable for our Saviour to &s;ave tho&s;e who will not have him to rule over them? and, after he hath expre&s;sly declared they &s;hall be bro't and &s;lain in his pre&s;ence? Is it honourable to give up a divine con&s;titution, with &s;uch characters of wi&s;dom, grace, glory and perfection, as above de&s;cribed, becau&s;e his enemies do not like it? Is it honourable or wi&s;e to annul and &s;et it a&s;ide after being confirmed by the promi&s;es, oath and immutability of God, and thereby to de&s;troy the everla&s;ting &s;ecurity of the believing and redeemed world, and to unhinge the moral world of confidence in his adorable truth and immutability? It is not in imagina|tion to conceive greater di&s;honours to God and the Saviour, and mi&s;chiefs to the moral creation, than mu&s;t follow the de|&s;truction of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, to make way for the &s;alva|tion of final impenitents; nor any thing more impo&s;&s;ible. So exceedingly the rever&s;e is their &s;cheme, from what they would glo&s;s it off to the world, to be. This in&s;inuation is &s;ugge&s;ted once and again. To what is already &s;aid, I will only here &s;ubjoin the Dr's te&s;timony again&s;t it, as highly di&s;honourable to God and the Saviour. His words are, "faith in the only begotten Son of God &s;tamps a character, and the greate&s;t and mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting one too, upon the &s;ubjects of it. They have upon them that mark of God, which di&s;criminates them from all o|ther &s;inners in the world: nor can they be ju&s;tified, unle&s;s they have this di&s;tingui&s;hing mark or character. This is as evident a truth as any in the &s;acred books of &s;cripture. And if God has revealed this as a go&s;pel truth, for any to &s;ay, that di&s;hon|our

is hereby reflected on the obedience and blood of Chri&s;t (by limiting ju&s;tification and &s;alvation to believers only) is in reality of con&s;truction, to reproach God: and it would indeed be a reproach to Chri&s;t al&s;o, to introduce his blood as operating to the &s;inner's ju&s;tification (and &s;alvation) in a way God has not appointed." "The fooli&s;hne&s;s of God, is wi&s;er than men," and "the wi&s;dom of this world is always found (e&s;pecially when the rea&s;oning is in direct oppo&s;ition to the all-wi&s;e con&s;titution of God) in the end, "to be fooli&s;hne&s;s with God." If God has made it nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;inner &s;hould be a believer (which can be only in this world) before he &s;hall be ju&s;tified; or, what means the &s;ame thing, before he &s;hall reap &s;aving benefit by the obedience and blood of Chri&s;t, we &s;hall give all due honor to this fini&s;hed work of his, while we con&s;ider it as available to the ju&s;tification of the believing &s;in|ner, only. We now give it its proper u&s;e (and that which is infinitely the mo&s;t honourable) and &s;hould di&s;grace, rather than honor it, &s;hould we extend its u&s;e, and attribute a &s;ufficiency to it to a purpo&s;e God never de&s;igned it for."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See his &s;ermons, p. 174, 5, 6, 7, &amp; 8.</NOTE> And to extend it to the &s;alvation of final unbelievers, is to extend it to a purpo&s;e expre&s;sly again&s;t the de&s;ign of God and our Saviour declared in the texts we have argued from.

<P>To proceed,</P>
<P>PROPOSITION IV. "It is the purpo&s;e of God, according to his good plea&s;ure, that mankind univer&s;ally, in con&s;equence of the death of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall certainly and finally be &s;aved." The fir&s;t text adduced in proof is, Rom. 5.12, to the end. It is as needle&s;s, as it would be tedious, to go over his paraphra&s;e and notes to &s;upport it, which take up about &s;eventy pages. That which immediately concerns us at pre|&s;ent is, his doctrine deduced from v. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 21, viz. that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, the ju&s;tification of life is come upon all men, &s;o that they &s;hall univer&s;ally "reign in life forever." He &s;ays, p. 80. "the plain truth is, final ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation is ab&s;olutely the free gift of God to all men, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that is to &s;ay, he has ab&s;olutely and un|conditionally determined, of his rich mercy, through the inter|vening
<PB N="145" REF="019737_0164_0FACA40BB1888AC0">
mediation of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that all men, the whole race of lap&s;ed Adam, &s;hall finally reign in life, and be prepared for that &s;tate, by being formed into righteous per&s;ons." This is the doctrine he makes this apo&s;tle preach to the world. Certainly, Paul taught no &s;uch doctrine, "that ju&s;tification of life is come upon all the finally wicked, and that they &s;hould reign in eternal life." It involves the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities in it; it is contradicted by the current doctrine of &s;cripture, and is repeatedly refuted by Paul him&s;elf: the word ju&s;tification can|not admit of three or four different &s;en&s;es in the &s;ame continued di&s;cour&s;e, as in his introduction and paraphra&s;e he makes it to do, to &s;upport his tenet; and this tenet is directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the apo&s;tle's doctrine "of ju&s;tification by faith," with all his arguments and illu&s;trations in &s;upport of it; and in fact infers the very conclu&s;ion and doctrine which Paul rejects with the utmo&s;t abhorrence, "with a God forbid." In a word, the &s;cope of the apo&s;tle in the foregoing part of this epi&s;tle, his rea&s;on|ings in &s;upport of, and inferences from his doctrine of ju&s;tifi|cation by faith, in connexion with his grand de&s;ign in the whole, all naturally and nece&s;&s;arily lead us to a con&s;truction e&s;&s;entially different, and &s;ubver&s;ive of this author's con&s;truction and doc|trine. If the&s;e things are true, it is impo&s;&s;ible the apo&s;tle could preach the doctrine we oppo&s;e. Here (1.) the &s;uppo&s;ition that Paul taught this doctrine, involves the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities in it. Paul could not teach the finally wicked &s;hould "reign in life forever," without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds of his &s;acred com|mi&s;&s;ion, and directly contradicting his in&s;tructions given in it, in the letter and &s;pirit of them: which is gro&s;sly ab&s;urd. His commi&s;&s;ion we have recorded, Acts 26.17, 18. "delivering thee from the people, and from the gentiles, unto whom now I &s;end thee; to open their eyes, and to turn them from dark|ne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God, that they may receive the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, &amp; inheritance among them which are &s;anctified by faith that is in me." Chri&s;t's in&s;tructi|ons in this commi&s;&s;ion plainly warrant and limit him, to pro|mi&s;e and in&s;ure the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins and the inheritance of heaven to them, and them only, that are &s;anctified in this world, by faith in Chri&s;t. He could not therefore teach that ju&s;tification of life is come upon all the unbelieving and un|&s;anctified,
<PB N="146" REF="019737_0165_0FACA40C7759A998">
and they &s;hall reign in life forever, without directly contradicting the letter and &s;pirit of his in&s;tructions, in this &s;acred commi&s;&s;ion: which no believer can admit. And the commi&s;&s;ion to the other apo&s;tles carries preci&s;ely the &s;ame in|&s;tructions and limitation in it. They were commi&s;&s;ioned to go forth into all the world, and "preach the go&s;pel to every crea|ture;" and to inforce the requi&s;itions of it, by the&s;e infinitely weighty arguments, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned," Mar. 16.15, 16. They could not go beyond the commandment of the Lord to alter the&s;e terms of &s;alvation and damnation, to &s;ettle the &s;tates of believers and unbelievers, for eternity. They had no authority to alter the terms of life and death to mankind, &s;o deci&s;ively fixed, in their in&s;tructions: and therefore they could not teach that final unbelievers "&s;hould reign in life forever" without contradicting the very language, letter and &s;pirit of their com|mi&s;&s;ion, nor without betraying their &s;acred tru&s;t, in &s;ubverting the terms of life and death they were ordered to publi&s;h to the world: and withal &s;ubverting the adorable authority, the&s;e terms were de&s;igned to &s;upport, and by which, they were com|mi&s;&s;ionated: and the&s;e terms are infallibly fixed, as the only way of life for &s;inful man. No Chri&s;tian can admit &s;o impious an ab&s;urdity. Again, the object of Paul's mini&s;try was, "to open the eyes of men and turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and the power of &s;atan unto God." It is gro&s;sly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, he would take the devil's doctrine, to &s;ubvert his kingdom, to open the eyes of men and turn them from &s;atan unto God.&mdash; This is the fact in the &s;cheme we oppo&s;e. For, the old &s;erpent fir&s;t taught man to di&s;regard the authority, government and threatnings of God; and to rebel again&s;t the term of life ex|pre&s;sly appointed of God to man, in this &s;tate, with a promi&s;e "ye &s;hall not die, but be as gods," i. e. immortally happy. This is the grand &s;nare of rebellion again&s;t God, and of ruin to mankind. This author is more explicit, the ju&s;tification of life is &s;o come upon all men, including all that live and die in re|bellion again&s;t the go&s;pel terms of life, that they &s;hall reign in life forever. Paul could not attempt to open the eyes of the idolatrous gentiles, by teaching, if they lived and died in their idolatry, &s;uper&s;tition and wickedne&s;s, yet they would finally
<PB N="147" REF="019737_0166_0FACA40D2FF417B0">
reign in life forever; for it would infallibly clo&s;e their eyes, and harden their hearts in infidelity, idolatry and wickedne&s;s: he could not teach tho&s;e who live in rebellion to the go&s;pel terms of life, and die enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that they &s;hould reign in life, for he taught them oft mo&s;t affectionately, with tears and weeping, "their end was de&s;truction," Phil. 3.18, 19. Again, we know Paul executed his commi&s;&s;ion by teaching a doctrine as contrary to this, as light is to darkne&s;s; "he was not di&s;obedient to the heavenly vi&s;ion," but taught Jews and Gentiles to repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance," to obtain forgivene&s;s &amp; the heavenly inheritance, as v. 19, 20. And he called the elders of Ephe&s;us to record, "that he was pure from the blood of all men," and "had not &s;hunned to declare the whole coun&s;el of God" nor kept back any thing which was profitable to them. How? by te&s;tifying (not that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, but) to Jews and Gentiles "repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," as nece&s;&s;ary terms whereby they could be &s;aved, Acts 20. 17th to the 28th ver&s;e: he could not therefore ab&s;urdly teach, this contrary doctrine. Moreover, the grand de&s;ign of Paul's mi|ni&s;try, was to reconcile &s;inful men to God, in this world: to reduce them to a willing &s;ubjection and obedience to the divine authority, go&s;pel, law and government, by faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and repentance towards God. As is evident from 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. compared with the 20th chapter of Acts forecited. It was to carry into execution the grand intention of the death of Chri&s;t "to redeem men from all iniquity and purify to him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works" in this life, and of the &s;aving grace of God, given in pur&s;uance of it, and to effect it; and bring them "to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, rignteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world," as he him&s;elf teacheth it, Tit. 2.11. to the end. And for this important end, we know he &s;pent a mo&s;t active life, and all his labours. Therefore we know that Paul could not teach, that all the wicked that live and die enemies to God and the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, "&s;hould reign in eternal life," becau&s;e, in this he would preach rebellion again&s;t the de&s;ign of his mini&s;try, the intention of the death of Chri&s;t, and of the &s;aving grace of God, as revealed to men, as he him&s;elf hath
<PB N="148" REF="019737_0167_0FACA40DEB0CEB78">
declared it. It is teaching rebellion in the con&s;truction of com|mon &s;en&s;e, and of &s;cripture, in the &s;en&s;e in which Hananiah taught it. Hananiah did not in direct terms teach I&s;rael to go on and be wicked, no more than the univer&s;ali&s;ts: but again&s;t all the &s;olemn me&s;&s;ages of in&s;truction, warning, threatning and exhortations to repentance addre&s;&s;ed to them, by the prophet Jeremiah, Hananiah taught them they &s;hould have peace and deliverance: and for this contra&s;ted in&s;truction, he is charged by Jehovah with teaching rebellion again&s;t the Lord; and has the &s;entence and execution of an untimely death; &s;ee Jeremiah 28th chap. To impute &s;uch a doctrine of rebellion to Paul, is a ba&s;e reflection upon the apo&s;tle, and the &s;pirit of in&s;piration. Whatever be the meaning of the&s;e di&s;puted texts, the doctrine we oppo&s;e cannot be taught in them; becau&s;e we &s;ee it involves the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities, and is de&s;truction to the character of the apo&s;tle. He could not &s;o palpably contradict the in&s;tructi|ons in his divine commi&s;&s;ion, nor take the old &s;erpent's doctrine to de&s;troy the devil's kingdom, and turn &s;inner's to God and holine&s;s, when it can only &s;erve to blind and harden them to de&s;truction; nor, teach rebellion again&s;t the declared de&s;ign of his mini&s;try, of the death of Chri&s;t, and for which the &s;aving grace of God is revealed to men. It is impo&s;&s;ible. And that he never taught this doctrine is further evident, (2dly) "be|cau&s;e it is contradicted by the current doctrine of &s;cripture, and repeatedly refuted by Paul him&s;elf." What have the finally wicked to do with peace, and an eternal reign in life; when the God of truth hath repeatedly declared, in ab&s;olute terms "there is no peace to the wicked?" yea, after the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive proclamation of peace to mankind: "I create the fruit of the lips peace; peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, &s;aith the Lord," i. e. to tho&s;e who imbrace the terms of peace: it clo&s;es to them who rebel again&s;t them, "there is no peace &s;aith my God to the wicked," I&s;a. 56.19, 21. Paul could not encourage &s;uch a pre&s;umption of peace to the wicked, when he knew that "all the cur&s;es of the book of God" were levelled again&s;t it, to extirpate it out of the hearts of man|kind; as hath been &s;hewn from Deut. 29.19, and onwards. He could not encourage &s;uch an hope, when he knew it was re|peatedly written, "the hope of the wicked and hypocrite &s;hall
<PB N="149" REF="019737_0168_0FACA40EAACE6F60">
ab&s;olutely peri&s;h, at death." Be&s;ides, our Saviour teacheth us, tho&s;e in future torment cannot pa&s;s from thence, to the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed: "that the door &s;hall be &s;hut to the finally wick|ed:" "that they &s;hall never ta&s;te of his &s;upper," "&s;hall never &s;ee life," "but the wrath of God abideth on them." Could Paul open heaven's gates to the&s;e wicked ones, and teach that they &s;hould reign in life, when &s;o ab&s;olutely excluded from it, in repeated, mo&s;t peremptory terms, by the Lord him&s;elf? No, Paul is as peremptory in teaching the &s;ame doctrine, af|firming
<Q>they &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God: that they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God</Q>
the Father, Eph. 5.5. How ab&s;olute their exclu&s;ion? they have not any inheritance in it by gift, grant, by pre&s;ent title, or in rever&s;ion. In his epi&s;tles to the Corinthians and to the Hebrews, Paul introduces the unbelieving Jews, who were excluded God's re&s;t in Canaan, as examples of in&s;truction, ad|monition and warning that final unbelievers &s;hould never enter the heavenly re&s;t with the people of God. And he a&s;&s;erts of the wicked in peremptory terms "that Chri&s;t's death &s;hall pro|fit them nothing." How then, is it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould reign in life, by it? Are the&s;e the true &s;ayings of God? Are they &s;ealed with his truth and immutability? Surely, they mu&s;t be an everla&s;ting bar to the finally wicked's reigning in eternal life. And the whole go&s;pel con&s;titution &s;peaks the &s;ame lan|guage and witne&s;&s;eth the &s;ame truth, as hath been &s;hewn. It is then, incredible, yea, impo&s;&s;ible, that the apo&s;tle &s;hould teach the contrary doctrine, and of &s;et purpo&s;e too, as this author makes him to do.

of this context "therefore being ju&s;tified by faith" this author under&s;tands "the ju&s;tification of life, as appropriated to be|lievers;" including their exemption from the wrath to come, and in&s;tatement in eternal life, in the great day, as p. 37 and 90. in this, he is undoubtedly right. And I would remark, this is the only &s;en&s;e, in which "ju&s;tification of life" is u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament. The Dr. is full and explicit in this &s;enti|ment. He &s;ays, "the plain truth is, "the ju&s;tification of life" tho' the gift of God's grace, and his gift through the obedience of Chri&s;t unto death, is no where in the &s;acred writings, &s;aid to be be&s;towed upon &s;inners, in common: neither are the &s;inners, upon whom it is be&s;towed, pointed out by their names; but by this grand characteri&s;tic "faith in Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermons, p. 158.</NOTE> In direct con|tradiction to the Dr. this author makes "the ju&s;tification of life," v. 18. to come upon &s;inners in common, upon all men univer&s;ally, &s;o "that they &s;hall reign in life for ever." The Dr. without doubt is right, and this author palpably wrong, The Dr. &s;ays, p. 165. "that no &s;inner &s;hall ever enjoy the be|nefit of Chri&s;t's fini&s;hed work, who is not a believer in him, is a go&s;pel truth: and it is as &s;imple and plain a truth, as that Chri&s;t fini&s;hed his work by dying on the cro&s;s." I wi&s;h the univer&s;ali&s;ts to attend "to this plain and important truth," it might effect their conviction: it is fatal to their &s;cheme. They mu&s;t be believers or never reign in life: and they mu&s;t be be|lievers in this world, or never. Sinners in hell, can never be|come believers in the &s;en&s;e of the go&s;pel con&s;titution. Nor doth this author ever once, in his whole treati&s;e, pretend they will be believers there: Con&s;equently, "this plain, &s;imple, go&s;pel truth" &s;hews "they can never be &s;aved." In the la&s;t ver&s;e of the foregoing chapter, &s;peaking of Chri&s;t, Paul &s;ays, "who was delivered for our offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification." By "our ju&s;tification," meaning," tho&s;e who believe, whether jew or gentile." His preceeding &s;ubject leads to this con&s;truction, only: for he is treating not of the ju&s;tification of &s;inners in common, but by faith only: and par|ticularly as it is oppo&s;ed to ju&s;tification, by law and works. Again, the immediate connexion leads to this con&s;truction, he infers from the example of Abraham, who&s;e faith was imputed

for righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o will our's al&s;o, jew or gentile, "if we be|lieve on him that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us or Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification:" the ju&s;tification of whom, can he mean, but tho&s;e who believe as Abraham did, and not unbelievers? Again, the connexion with what follows, indicates this con&s;truction. For he immediately draws his conclu&s;ion, and points out the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings and privileges connected with, and flowing from, "the ju&s;tification of life" appropriate to believers, as this author allows, "therefore being ju&s;tified by faith we have peace with God," &amp;c. v. 1. of the context and onwards. But this author &s;ays, "he was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification" includes jews and gentiles, us, the whole world; and means our being brought back to a capacity of being ju&s;tified, and put into the go&s;pel method of ju&s;tification, by faith, p. 34. the whole world who are become guilty before God, as ch. 3.19, 20, 21. "the&s;e all now (he &s;ays) under the go&s;pel &s;tand ju&s;tified in fact by the blood of Chri&s;t" in the &s;en&s;e above explained, p. 37. To this I object, it cannot be true of that part of the whole world, who have died in their &s;ins. They are not in fact, in a capacity of being ju&s;tified, by faith: nor are the great ble&s;&s;ings of ju&s;tifi|cation of life, po&s;&s;ible to them: they will not be &s;aved from wrath in the day of wrath, nor then be in&s;tated in eternal life. This he allows, is appropriate to believers. Again, if this doctrine be true, what can we make of our Lord's words, "he that believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him? or, what can we make of it as to the damned, when our Lord's &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed and executed upon them? they belong to the whole world of mankind, and do they in fact &s;tand ju&s;tified, by the blood of Chri&s;t? either this doctrine directly contradicts that of our Saviour, or the terms ju&s;tifica|tion, condemnation, and damnation are utterly confounded. Further, ju&s;tification is a law term, and the ju&s;tified mu&s;t &s;tand approved as righteous, by &s;ome law or other. Upon which, I a&s;k, by what law or rule of judgment do the unbelieving and ungodly &s;tand ju&s;tified before God? not, by the covenant of innocency, for in this author's opinion, the po&s;terity of Adam had no concern in it. Not, by the law of nature, for the apo|&s;tle expre&s;sly excludes ju&s;tification by the law and by works.
<PB N="152" REF="019737_0171_0FACA410FA7C6598">
Not, by the go&s;pel con&s;titution, for none can be ju&s;tified ac|cording to this, but believers. There is therefore, no law or rule, by which ju&s;tification can be predicated of the unbelieving and ungodly. I would add, "a capacity of being ju&s;tified, is not ju&s;tification: and a man's being put in the way to be ju&s;ti|fied, cannot denominate him, ju&s;tified: no more than a man's being in a capacity to be rich can denominate him rich; when he is in fact, wretched poor: nor any more, than a man's being under means and advantages to be a good man, can denomi|nate him good; when in truth and fact, he is very wicked. It is not common &s;en&s;e, but a manife&s;t abu&s;e of language.</P>
<P>This author introduces ver&s;e 9th of the context, "much more then being now ju&s;tified by his blood, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him," as another in&s;tance, where ju&s;tifi|cation mu&s;t be under&s;tood in his lax &s;en&s;e, "of a capacity of ju&s;tification and being put in the go&s;pel way of being ju&s;tified by faith." But why? when the apo&s;tle is ex profe&s;&s;o, drawing his inferences and conclu&s;ions from the ju&s;tification appropriate to believers, ver&s;e fir&s;t&mdash;it is mo&s;t natural to under&s;tand it, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e v. 9. this author &s;ays no, and blames Dr. Dod|dridge for this con&s;truction; for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, becau&s;e the apo&s;tle celebrates the love of God, from the character of the per&s;ons for whom he &s;ent his Son to die, "while ungodly and &s;inners he died for them." This doth not prove, but faith is the medium of our ju&s;tification, and that we cannot be ju&s;tified without it." For the apo&s;tle plainly teacheth us, "this pro|pitiation of Chri&s;t is effectual to our ju&s;tification through faith in his blood," Rom. 3.24, 25, 26. So taught the apo&s;tle, and &s;o teacheth the Dr. &s;peaking of ju&s;tification "as the gift of God, the gift by grace,"&amp;c. he &s;ays, "we were indeed, in the eye of God, without &s;trength, enemies, ungodly, &s;inners, when he purpo&s;ed and contrived the go&s;pel method of &s;alva|tion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Serm. p 149.</NOTE> And yet in a perfect con&s;i&s;tence herewith, he every where, in his &s;ermons and notes maintains, that faith is the medium of our intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and the mean whereby we are ju&s;tified. And a&s;&s;erts "that no &s;inner can have the benefit of Chri&s;t's fini&s;hed work, who is not a believer:" and that no man can be ju&s;tified, while he is an unbeliever."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 165.</NOTE> If the Dr. is right, the apo&s;tle in this text, is &s;peaking of believers only, and

not of &s;inners in common, as "ju&s;tified by his blood." But his &s;econd rea&s;on, he &s;ays, "is deci&s;ive," becau&s;e if we under|&s;tand him in this &s;en&s;e, we &s;hall ab&s;olutely de&s;troy the force of the argument, he u&s;es; for as &s;alvation from wrath is one thing e&s;&s;entially included in that ju&s;tification, which is the re&s;ult of true faith, it would be ridiculous to argue, much more being ju&s;tified meaning hereby this ju&s;tification, we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath: and adds, the word now is emphatical, p. 37. His deci&s;ive rea&s;on, is with me no rea&s;on, and what he calls ri|diculous, has not the lea&s;t impropriety, in it. Surely, when the apo&s;tle had e&s;tabli&s;hed his doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, and proceeds by way of inference, to point out the great benefits of it; there is not the lea&s;t impropriety in illu&s;trating the contents of the doctrine, it&s;elf. But it was highly important, that he &s;hould teach it plainly to the world, for who &s;hould teach it but the apo&s;tles? and it is his &s;pecial de&s;ign to do it, in the two great branches of it, v. 9 and 10. And in this view, his conclu&s;ion is drawn with the greate&s;t propriety and force, as appear thus, Since God hath taken &s;uch an extraordinary mea|&s;ure as to give his Son to die for us while &s;inners and enemies, and hath be&s;towed the grace of faith on us, and brought us into a &s;tate of ju&s;tification of life, wherein we are intitled to reign in eternal life: "much more now (emphatical) being ju&s;tified by his blood" "&s;hall we be &s;aved from the wrath to come," which is an e&s;&s;ential benefit of this ju&s;tification. And by the &s;ame mode of arguing he proceeds in the 10th ver&s;e to infer, the other mo&s;t important privilege, contained in this ju&s;tification. "For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, (through faith, as v. 1.) much more being reconciled, &s;hall we be &s;aved by his life:" &s;aved with a com|pleat &s;alvation, by being in&s;tated immediately in eternal life, in the great day. This is arguing with great clearne&s;s and cogency. And this con&s;truction is far the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and edifying, and be&s;t fitted to impre&s;s every heart with the va&s;t importance of becoming believers; becau&s;e the privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of this ju&s;tification are &s;o infinitely important, on the one hand and on the other: and it is the only &s;en&s;e it will bear.</P>
<P>This author &s;ays, ju&s;tification in the 9th, and reconciliation in the 10th ver&s;e mean the &s;ame thing, though &s;ignified by dif|ferent
<PB N="154" REF="019737_0173_0FACA4128E0124E0">
allu&s;ions, p. 39. Agreed. By reconciliation he means, &s;uch a rechange of &s;tate in &s;inners in common, that they are put into a capacity, whereby, by becoming believers, they may attain eternal life. But this is not a being reconciled to God, nor can they be &s;o denominated, on that ground. It is a great impropriety and abu&s;e of language: as much as it would be, to &s;ay of all &s;inners under the go&s;pel, becau&s;e they have the means, and are under a capacity of getting to heaven, that they are actually in heaven; nor is this what Paul means "by being ju&s;tified and reconciled to God:" as is evident (1.) becau&s;e reconciliation to God, is e&s;&s;entially connected with ju&s;tification of life. And it is the very fir&s;t great ble&s;&s;ing the apo&s;tle de|&s;cribes, as appropriate to believers, v. 1. "Therefore being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace (reconciliation and friend&s;hip) with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And this peace with God is every where appropriated to believers; and is &s;aid to pa&s;s all under&s;tanding; for the importance, ble&s;&s;ings and comforts of it. And why this author did not bring it to view, I know not, unle&s;s he found it difficult to reconcile it with his intended con&s;truction of ver&s;e 10th; and apprehended the di&s;|cerning reader would &s;ee its manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency with it. (2dly) becau&s;e the word reconciliation never means a rechange of &s;tate &s;imply, and no more. I have con&s;ulted all his texts, and find not one that will an&s;wer his purpo&s;e; that which &s;eems mo&s;t to favour it, is 1 Cor. 7.11. "But and if &s;he depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her hu&s;band." He paraphra&s;es "reconciled" let her be rechanged, return back to her former &s;tate of living with him. But common &s;en&s;e teach|eth, that more is implied and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed in this ca&s;e, than is contained in his paraphra&s;e. For what loving hu&s;band or wife ever parted and &s;eparated from one another, without &s;ome difference and alienation of affections? in the nature of the thing, it is an un&s;uppo&s;ible ca&s;e. The removal or healing of the difference, and conciliating of the affections, mu&s;t then, from the nature of the thing be pre&s;uppo&s;ed, and be in fact comprized, in the reconciliation, whereby their &s;tate is rechan|ged, &s;o as to live together. It is needle&s;s to remark upon his other texts, a di&s;cerning reader, will ea&s;ily &s;ee they mean more than &s;imply a change of &s;tate. But (3dly.) what is deci&s;ive,
<PB N="155" REF="019737_0174_0FACA414396490E0">
is, his con&s;truction totally de&s;troys the force of the apo&s;tle's rea&s;onings, and makes his conclu&s;ion an ab&s;olute fal&s;hood, in fact. The apo&s;tle could not infer from the ju&s;tified, in his &s;en&s;e, "much more &s;hall tho&s;e who are put in a capacity to be|come believers, and attain eternal life, be &s;aved from wrath;" becau&s;e, as to all of them, who are final unbelievers, it is a fal&s;|hood, in fact: they mu&s;t &s;uffer the wrath to come, the agonies of the &s;econd death. Had Paul u&s;ed the prepo&s;ition ex or ek they would have argued, they &s;hould be delivered out of a &s;tate of wrath; but as it is, apo tes orges, his meaning is deci&s;ively clear: the ju&s;tified he intends &s;hall not undergo the future wrath. And the &s;ame fal&s;e conclu&s;ion follows, from his notion of reconciliation in the 10th ver&s;e: for all ungodly &s;inners who are now in a capacity of being &s;aved by faith, will not be &s;aved with a compleat &s;alvation in the day of judgment; as is inten|ded in this ver&s;e, in Heb. 9.28. and throughout his writings. And therefore his con&s;truction of the words ju&s;tification and reconciliation, mu&s;t be as evidently fal&s;e, as the fal&s;e conclu&s;i|on it would fa&s;ten upon the apo&s;tle. Moreover, it is certain from this conclu&s;ion, Paul draws, of "the ju&s;tified by the blood of Chri&s;t," viz, "that they &s;hall be &s;aved from future wrath" that believers are intended and they only: for this is a privi|lege, appropriate to them. And it is certain from this declara|tion, that every individual per&s;on that is ju&s;tified by the blood of Chri&s;t, &s;hall in fact be &s;aved from the wrath to come. This is fatal to his con&s;truction of ver&s;e 18. The ju&s;tification of life is not come upon all men; for if it was, they would (by this conclu&s;ion of the apo&s;tle) be univer&s;ally &s;aved from the wrath to come, Whereas, all the finally ungodly &s;hall in fact endure this wrath, and &s;uffer the &s;econd death; this author being judge. Con&s;equently, the ju&s;tification of life in this 18th ver&s;e, mu&s;t be the &s;ame with ver&s;e fir&s;t, and which we have proved to be intended in ver&s;e 9th, and is peculiar to believers: and the all men upon whom it is come, intends all believers, whether jew or gentile, as I tru&s;t will be fully evident, before we quit the &s;ubject. It will likewi&s;e follow, that his key of con&s;truction, viz. that the all men in both &s;ides of the compari&s;on, between Adam and Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be univer&s;ally the &s;ame, is a false one,

<P>The apo&s;tle having inferred to the ju&s;tified by faith, ver. 1. two infinitely important privileges and ble&s;&s;ings which await believers, in the great day&mdash;deliverance from wrath&mdash;and a compleatly glorious &s;alvation, ver. 9th and 10th, proceeds ver. 11th to another great and di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ing they have in the interim, the pre&s;ent time: "And not only &s;o, but we al&s;o joy in God (as our covenant God And Father) through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we have now (by faith, as ver. 1&s;t.) re|ceived the atonement or reconciliation." This makes the word "now" emphatical, the coherence and connexion, clear and &s;trong, the &s;en&s;e exhibited important, and the whole adapted to an&s;wer his de&s;ign, to recommend the doctrine of ju&s;tification, as worthy of all acceptation through the world; on account of the peculiar privileges, ble&s;&s;ings and glories contained in it, and flowing from it, to believers. But this author under&s;tands re|conciliation in ver&s;e 11th the &s;ame as in the foregoing ver&s;e, a change of &s;tate common to believers and &s;inners, through the world. To me it appears ab&s;urd, that after the apo&s;tle had &s;o &s;trongly and of &s;et purpo&s;e de&s;cribed the peculiar happine&s;s and ble&s;&s;ings of believers, he &s;hould conclude in &s;uch a flat man|ner, "that they had received, but what is common to them and an ungodly world. It is incredible. E&s;pecially, as we have &s;hewn the word "reconciled" in the foregoing ver&s;e, will not bear his con&s;truction; and al&s;o, that peace, reconciliation and friend&s;hip with God, is the very fir&s;t appropriate ble&s;&s;ing to believers, de&s;cribed ver&s;e fir&s;t. This author, having thus fixed his wrong &s;en&s;e upon the words "ju&s;tification and recon|ciliation," and hereby got his own mind and the mind of his reader upon the wheel of an ambiguous change of words, by annexing the&s;e wrong ideas to them&mdash;is prepared to apply his damage by Adam and advantage by Chri&s;t, to the &s;ame all men, univer&s;ally: and to fix a &s;en&s;e to the word ju&s;tification of life, ver&s;e 18, not only different from both the &s;en&s;es, in which he had already u&s;ed it; but far remote, from what it is ever u&s;ed, in the whole book of God. I will give the reader the words of the apo&s;tle, and his paraphra&s;e, in two columns.</P>

<P>It is obvious, at fir&s;t view, that in his con&s;truction, this ju&s;ti|fication means, a re&s;urrection to a happy immortality. But &s;urely, ju&s;tification and a re&s;urrection are different things, as different as a p&s;alm book and a te&s;tament, or any two things that can be named. And it is fal&s;e in fact, to aver, that a re|&s;urrection "to reign in life for ever," is come upon all men: for certainly, the re&s;urrection of the wicked, will be to damna|tion, It is al&s;o evident, "that ju&s;tification of life," bears no &s;uch &s;en&s;e, any where el&s;e, in the book of God. Nor doth he pretend to adduce any parallel text, to ju&s;tify this con&s;truction. The &s;ub&s;tance of his rea&s;on for it is, that the oppo&s;ition in the compari&s;on, upon his &s;cheme, requires it. But, if &s;uch a liberty may be taken, to put an unin&s;pired &s;en&s;e upon a text, which is no where found in &s;cripture, to accommodate it to a man's &s;cheme, there is no &s;ecurity in revelation: nor is there any &s;cheme of error in the world, but in this way may be fathered upon the oracles of God. In paraphra&s;ing that clau&s;e of ver&s;e 16. "but the free gift is of many offences, to ju&s;tification," he gives another and more &s;trange &s;en&s;e of the word: He &s;ays, it is a "ju&s;tification including in it their deliverance from &s;in as well as death," p. 26. that is, it includes both &s;anctification and the re&s;urrection: which is not only entirely remote from the &s;en&s;e in which Paul always u&s;es the word, and from which it is ever u&s;ed in &s;cripture; but it tends totally to confound &s;cripture language, and the di&s;tinct, different doctrines taught in it. In his application of his paraphra&s;e and notes, he gives us this re&s;ult, p. 80. "the plain truth is, that final, everla&s;ting &s;alvation is ab&s;olutely the free gift of God to all men, through

Je&s;us Chri&s;t," and &s;o on as before noted. Upon which I would remark, if this gift or grant of God be made to all men, and the apo&s;tle has &s;o taught, it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t, principally collec|ted from ver&s;e 18. where he &s;ays "the free gift came upon all men, unto ju&s;tification of life:" for it is the only text, which exppre&s;&s;es all men, the re&s;t are &s;uppo&s;ed, by implication. Let us traver&s;e this text, and &s;ee if this doctrine be taught in it.&mdash; It is obvious, that this complex <HI>all men,</HI> includes two manner of people, in this world and world to come, who&s;e &s;tates are far more different than was that of E&s;au and Jacob and their po&s;terity, as nations, in this world. For this complex all men, are &s;ome in heaven, &s;ome in hell, and others on earth; in who&s;e ca&s;es, re&s;pecting ju&s;tification of life, there is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference: con&s;equently, this ju&s;tification, as predicated of the whole, mu&s;t carry in it two as extremely wide and different &s;en&s;es, as there is in the &s;tate of this complex all men, on whom it is &s;aid to come. Is this po&s;&s;ible? It is incredible, that Paul &s;hould u&s;e it, in &s;o many different &s;en&s;es, as already noted in the compa&s;s of twenty ver&s;es. But that one and the &s;ame phra&s;e re&s;pecting the &s;ame &s;ubject, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould carry in it two &s;en&s;es &s;o extremely different, as this ju&s;tification applied to all men mu&s;t do; &s;urely "exceeds all belief," and is enough to &s;tun an infidel. Again, to &s;ay "the ju&s;tification of life," one of the mo&s;t important privileges of the go&s;pel and kingdom of God, is come upon all tho&s;e who now are, and ever will be ca&s;t out of this kingdom, and all its ble&s;&s;ings, and be con&s;igned to the damnation of hell, is &s;uch an outrage upon common &s;en&s;e that a &s;avage might blu&s;h to be guilty of. Moreover, if this gift and grant be made to all men, then, the privileges and ble&s;|&s;ings of it, mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame to this complex <HI>all men,</HI> otherwi&s;e this author's key is blown, "the plai&s;ter is not as big as the &s;ore" as he expre&s;&s;es it. Try this gift and grant by com|mon &s;en&s;e, and &s;ee the re&s;ult. Common &s;en&s;e teacheth, that every gift or grant "whether of power or privilege," mu&s;t convey e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame power or privilege, to all the &s;ub|jects of it. E. g. thus, the commi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;try, granted to the apo&s;tles, conveyed the &s;ame and equal powers to all, whom Chri&s;t commi&s;&s;ionated, by it. And the great charter of adoption, granted by our Lord to believers, John 1.12. con|veys
<PB N="159" REF="019737_0178_0FACA416EC79A690">
e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame privileges, to all the &s;ubjects of it. "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to be|come the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name." And thus it mu&s;t be with the important gift and grant "of ju&s;tification of life." The e&s;&s;ential privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of it, mu&s;t appertain, to all the happy &s;ubjects of it. Is it true, that the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of ju&s;tification, appertain to this complex all men, in this world and world to come, on whom it is &s;aid to come? trace the fact. To the one, the believing part of this all men, the ju&s;tification of life brings with it "peace with God," "acce&s;s by faith into his grace wherein they &s;tand," "rejoicing in hope of the glory of God," "glorying in tribulations for the &s;anctified improvement and benefits of them," "a hope that maketh not a&s;hamed," "&s;up|ported by the love of God &s;hed abroad in the heart," and "joy in God as their covenant God and Father" in this world, as the ble&s;&s;ings are annumerated v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11th of the con|text, together with their being approved as righteous, delivered from the wrath to come, and immediately in&s;tated in eternal life, in the great judgment day, as v. 9 &amp; 10th. To the other, the whole unbelieving part of this complex all men, this &s;up|po&s;ed gift and grant conveys not one of the&s;e peculiar annu|merated ble&s;&s;ings in this life, nor at the day of judgment. But the Saviour and Judge tells us, "they are condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on them." And that in the great day "they &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment." And this author &s;ays, in that day, they will be condemned to an age of awful, unutterable puni&s;hment, and will literally die, the &s;econd death. But &s;omehow, and at &s;ome time or another, they will be quickened from that death, and if &s;till &s;tubborn, will be tran&s;muted into a different &s;tate or &s;tates, and be tormented in a different di&s;pen&s;ation or di&s;pen&s;ations for ages of ages, till they are humbled and purified, nobody knows how&mdash;where&mdash; or when&mdash;but when fitted for it, they &s;hall reign in eternal life. Here we have traced the fact as this author would have it.&mdash; Let the reader judge, does this gift and grant as applied to this great complex body, convey the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential privileges and ble&s;&s;ings to all the individual &s;ubjects of the&s;e all men, on whom it is &s;aid to come? by no means: their &s;tates are as different
<PB N="160" REF="019737_0179_0FACA417A6B3AB48">
as heaven and hell. Did the apo&s;tle mean to contain all this variety and contradiction, in this important phra&s;e? Could he mean that this free gift's coming upon men, &s;hould have &s;uch a con&s;truction, contradictory to all the gifts and grants of power or privilege ever given or granted by God or man, thro' the whole world? it is impo&s;&s;ible. Therefore, the all men on whom it is come, mu&s;t mean believers only: on the&s;e only, can it be predicated, and to the&s;e only doth it agree.</P>
<P>I will add once more, "ju&s;tification of life" cannot be ap|plied to all the unbelieving and ungodly, becau&s;e it is a repug|nant contradiction, to the nature, import and de&s;ign of this im|portant privilege. "Ju&s;tification" can no more mean the re|&s;urrection, or the re&s;urrection and &s;anctification, than it can mean election and adoption: &s;uch an application being alike, entirely alien, from the nature and de&s;ign of it. But what I would particularly note is, the apo&s;tle could not per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">haps have cho&s;en a word, more ab&s;olutely exclu&s;ive of the con&s;truction and doctrine we oppo&s;e, than "ju&s;tification:" for the whole of this glorious privilege, con&s;i&s;ts in the ble&s;&s;ings appropriate to believers in this life, and be&s;towed in the day of judgment: in their being approved, &s;aved from wrath, and in&s;tated in eter|nal life, in that day. The doctrine and &s;ubject is then exhau&s;|ted: for the whole privilege and final ble&s;&s;ings of it, are then all be&s;towed of God, and compleatly enjoyed by all the ju&s;tified, the whole believing world, in that day. The doctrine is per|fectly illu&s;trated, fulfilled and fini&s;hed. It is ended, &s;ucceeded, and if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, &s;wallowed up, in another more illu&s;|trious privilege, e&s;&s;entially connected with it, viz. their glori|fication; as in that golden chain, Rom. 8.30. "and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified." Now &s;ince the whole ble&s;|&s;ings of ju&s;tification are then be&s;towed, and the whole de&s;ign of it, then compleated; it is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing, that it can be extended to any others, or any more, than to the believing and ju&s;tified, in that day. Ju&s;tification in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e, can no more be extended to the unbelieving and con|demned in that day, either then, or afterwards to eternity, than a prophecy that hath been already compleatly fulfilled, can be &s;aid to be &s;till in force and yet to be fulfilled. The predication in both ca&s;es, being alike repugnant and ab&s;olutely contradic|tory
<PB N="161" REF="019737_0180_0FACA41866F3B1E8">
to the nature and de&s;ign of the &s;ubject and doctrine, to which it is applied.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t we have made full proof, that the word "ju&s;tifica|tion" will not bear the different con&s;tructions he puts upon it, in &s;upport of his tenet. It is already &s;hewn, that the Dr. ex|pre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, "the ju&s;tification of life" is no where in the &s;acred writings, &s;aid to be be&s;towed upon &s;inners in common; but is appropriate to believers, and repeatedly a&s;&s;erts and proves, "that no one can be ju&s;tified, who is not a believer." With|out recurring to all the texts upon the &s;ubject, by what hath been la&s;t offered we &s;ee the &s;ure and evident ground upon which it &s;tands, viz. "it is a contradiction to the nature, import and de&s;ign of the great doctrine of "ju&s;tification" to apply it to the unbelieving and ungodly "who are condemned already" and will be condemned in the day of judgment. And from what hath been proved it clearly and certainly follows, that the <HI>all men</HI> on whom ju&s;tification of life is come, are believers, only&mdash; that his key, in applying it to all unbelievers, is a fal&s;e one; and that his doctrine of the &s;alvation of all men is not ground|ed on, but is in fact confuted, by this text, in its connexion with the context.</P>
<P>To proceed, (4thly.) the tenet we oppo&s;e, is directly &s;ubver|&s;ive of the apo&s;tle's doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, with all his arguments and illu&s;trations in &s;upport of it: and in fact in|fers the very conclu&s;ion and doctrine which Paul rejects with the utmo&s;t abhorrence, with a "God forbid." It is already &s;hewn, the great doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, will terminate in the tran&s;actions of the day of judgment. The final ble&s;&s;ings of it will then be be&s;towed, and the de&s;ign of it be compleatly an&s;wered and terminate in it. Now, to &s;ay that the condemned in that day, will yet be &s;aved in &s;ome after di&s;pen&s;ations, is entirely to &s;et a&s;ide this whole doctrine as unnece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of men; as u&s;ele&s;s, and no in&s;trument or medium of &s;alvation in fact, to a great part of them, who &s;hall be &s;aved. Surely, Paul could not thus &s;ubvert and aboli&s;h his divine doc|trine of ju&s;tification, by faith. He labours with many argu|ments, to exhibit this doctrine, the only way of life for &s;inful man; and illu&s;trates it in the example of Abraham in the pre|ceeding chapters. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, when he is making his
<PB N="162" REF="019737_0181_0FACA4192A3CC650">
inferences from this very doctrine, to illu&s;trate the importance and glory of it, and comes to this paragraph in di&s;pute, that he &s;hould go intirely off from his main &s;ubject, and &s;et up an op|po&s;ite doctrine, in contradiction to it, viz. that all the unbeliev|ing ungodly world &s;hould be &s;aved, without this ju&s;tification, and in a way &s;ubver&s;ive of it? Is it &s;uppo&s;ible, that he &s;hould introduce this tenet, and another di&s;pen&s;ation for the &s;alvation of all the finally wicked, and thereby &s;et a&s;ide not only this doc|trine of ju&s;tification by faith, but the whole &s;cheme of go&s;pel doc|trine connected with it; as regeneration, faith, repentance, go&s;|pel holine&s;s, go&s;pel precepts, in&s;titutions, promi&s;es, means, du|ties and privileges; in a word, that he &s;hould &s;et a&s;ide the whole oeconomy of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the kingdom of God in this world, as unnece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation? No friend to revela|tion, who well con&s;iders it, can po&s;&s;ibly admit it; for &s;uch an amazing contradiction of doctrine, in a continued di&s;cour&s;e, carries the highe&s;t reflection upon the character of the apo&s;tle as a writer, and upon the doctrine of in&s;piration it&s;elf. Again, the very &s;ame ab&s;urdity attends this tenet, as ju&s;tification by the law, upon which Paul rejects it, viz. it makes "faith void," &amp; the promi&s;e made to faith, and to believers "of none effect:" "for if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promi&s;e made of no effect," Rom. 4.14. This argu|ment is full as &s;trong again&s;t this &s;trange tenet: for if final, condemned unbelievers (who neither have, nor ever can have faith) are heirs, and &s;hall be &s;aved, it is glaringly evident "that faith is made void and the promi&s;e of none effect." The apo&s;tle argues this cannot be, v. 16. "therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the &s;eed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that al&s;o which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." Final unbelievers can never be the &s;eed here meant, nor can Abraham ever be the father of the finally condemned, in the &s;en&s;e intended, in this text. It is further to be noted, the very conclu&s;ion Paul reprobates, with utmo&s;t abhorrence, with a "God forbid" certainly attends this &s;trange doctrine, viz. "it makes void the law." "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the law," Rom. 3.31. The go&s;pel doctrine of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation by faith, doth
<PB N="163" REF="019737_0182_0FACA419E8A41D20">
mo&s;t &s;urely and &s;trongly e&s;tabli&s;h the moral law of God, in its variety of u&s;es, and as of indi&s;pen&s;ibly binding obligation upon all men, believers and others, in this world. It is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon many unchangable grounds, as that of the moral excel|lency and perfection of it, being "holy, ju&s;t and good." Again, as it is the de&s;ign of the Father, in opening this way of life to &s;inful men, to &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;h his authority, law and go|vernment over them; by opening a door whereby he may be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of every one who believes in Chri&s;t, and becomes cordially obedient unto him: and as it is the de&s;ign of the Son of God, in the redemption and &s;alvation of &s;inful men, to e&s;tabli&s;h it upon the mo&s;t &s;ure and unchangeable foun|dations; partly, by magnifying the law, and making it honor|able, in that righteou&s;ne&s;s whereby all the believing world are ju&s;tified, and partly, by his Spirit and grace actually reducing all whom he &s;aves, to become a willing people, cordially obe|dient to the authority, law and go&s;pel of God in this world. Furthermore, Chri&s;t hath a new e&s;tabli&s;hed the binding obli|gation of this divine law, upon all men by his own authority: announcing to the world "not a jot or tittle of the law &s;hall fail;" and that he who teacheth and exemplifieth this law, &s;hall be great in the kingdom of heaven; but he who doth the con|trary &s;hall be lea&s;t, (i. e.) &s;hall have no part in it, Mat. 5.18, 19. Paul teacheth we are under law to Chri&s;t. But what is of &s;pe|cial note is, the very faith whereby we are ju&s;tified and &s;aved, teaches and influences "to a cordial &s;ubjection &amp; obedience to the authority, law and go&s;pel of God. It works by love, puri|fies the heart, and &s;anctifies the life: and by this e&s;&s;ential pro|perty, it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the faith which will not &s;ave; as taught by St. Paul, James and John. So that this very faith e&s;tabli&s;hes and exalts the law of the Lord our God. In a word, this divine law is the indi&s;pen&s;ible rule of our duty and mea&s;ure of our happine&s;s; and without a genuine conformity to it "in go&s;pel holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." It is very evident, that in the&s;e and other ways which need not be mentioned, the go&s;pel doctrine of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation by faith, doth mo&s;t &s;trongly e&s;tabli&s;h the divine law as indi&s;pen&s;ibly binding upon all men in this world, and a cordial &s;ubjection and obe|diential regard to it in this life, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the
<PB N="164" REF="019737_0183_0FACA41AA5D04858">
&s;alvation of men. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God;" but "except a man be born again," "be born of the Spirit" and be made &s;piritual, "he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God," are the doctrines of Chri&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hing this truth. But the doctrine of the &s;alvation of all the final unbelieving and di&s;obedient, teaches rebellion and defiance to the law e&s;tabli&s;h|ing doctrine of faith, and to the law of God, it&s;elf: it teaches that men may live and die rebels to all the laws of God and man in this world, and yet there is not force enough in all the threatnings and cur&s;es in the book of God, to bar and finally exclude them, a reign in eternal life. Is not this to make void the law of God, in the precepts and penalties of it? What doth Paul mean by making void the law, but making it &s;o u&s;e|le&s;s, as that an obediential regard to it in this life, is unnece&s;|&s;ary to the &s;alvation of men? and doth not the doctrine we oppo&s;e, in this very &s;en&s;e make the law ab&s;olutely void? and the very doctrine of faith he was e&s;tabli&s;hing, likewi&s;e void? it is an horribly u&s;urping doctrine: it u&s;urps an authority above all that is called God, in heaven and earth: for it u&s;urps a di&s;|pen&s;ing power over all the authority and laws of God and of mankind: it &s;o di&s;pen&s;es all the obligations of mankind to God and to one another, that in violation of the whole, it pro|mi&s;es the rebellious &s;inner "a final reign in eternal life." What can be a more glaring ab&s;urdity in it&s;elf, or more flagrant con|tradiction to the whole tenor of revelation? to impute it to the grace of God, is a high di&s;honour to his wi&s;dom and grace; becau&s;e it is exhibiting his grace as oppo&s;ing and &s;ubverting the authority, law and government of God, in this world. To impute it to the mediation and blood of Chri&s;t, is to make him in&s;tead of the great &s;upporter, in reality the &s;ubverter of his Father's authority and government in this world; and al&s;o the &s;ubverter of his own authority and government, What di&s;|honours can be greater to the grace of God and to the Soviour of the world, than &s;uch impious imputations? and can &s;uch a doctrine be attributed to Saint Paul? No, he reprobates it, with greate&s;t indignation, with a "God forbid:" and let all good men join him in it, and &s;ay amen, to it. As a concluding evidence that Paul never taught this doctrine and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n this paragraph, we proceed to &s;hew (5thly.) the &s;cope of the
<PB N="165" REF="019737_0184_0FACA41B6AC93B58">
apo&s;tle in the foregoing part of this epi&s;tle, his rea&s;onings in &s;upport of, and inferences from his doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, in connexion with his grand de&s;ign in the whole, viz. to recommend and inforce it, all naturally and nece&s;&s;arily lead us to a con&s;truction e&s;&s;entially different, and &s;ubver&s;ive of this author's con&s;truction and doctrine. I apprehend this author did not recur back far enough to fix the &s;cope of the apo&s;tle and introduce the connexion, truly: had he done it, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf and the world the trouble of his paraphra&s;e and notes. The grand de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle is, to &s;et forth, e&s;tabli&s;h and recommend the doctrine in which he much glo|ried. It is in the fir&s;t chap. v. 16. "For I am not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for it is the power of God unto &s;alvation to every one that believeth, to the jew fir&s;t and al&s;o to the greek." It is &s;urely effectual for &s;alvation to every believer without di&s;tinction or exception: and it is exclu&s;ively, the only way of life for &s;inful man." This &s;eems to be the preci&s;e view and grand intention of the apo&s;tle, as appears by his arguments, illu&s;trations and inferences. The Dr. is full in this &s;entiment; affirming, that "faith in the promi&s;ed &s;eed (Chri&s;t) has all a|long been, now is, and always will be, the only way of life, for &s;inful man." Would the, univer&s;ali&s;ts heartily &s;ub&s;cribe this, the controver&s;y is ended. For the conclu&s;ion is self-evi|dent, "if this be the only way of life" no final unbeliever can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved. To prove his doctrine and compleatly an|&s;wer his intention, the apo&s;tle adduces and &s;ets forth "the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith:" this opens a door of &s;alva|tion to all the living world, upon the &s;ame terms. Jews and gentiles without di&s;tinction or exception, upon becoming be|lievers, &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved. On the other hand, in the nature of it, it is exclu&s;ive of every other way of life: for &s;in|ful men cannot be &s;aved, unle&s;s they be ju&s;tified: and no one can be ju&s;tified but by faith in Chri&s;t. His argumentation is as clear as demon&s;tration, and fully an&s;wers his intention. The jew can have no objection, for it is the way of &s;alvation pointed out in the revelation of God to that people. This is his fir&s;t argument and proof, "for the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God is revealed (in that revelation) from faith to faith," "as it is written, the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith," ver&s;e 17th. That it is exclu&s;ively,
<PB N="166" REF="019737_0185_0FACA41C2907F7A0">
the only way of life, he evinceth by this general argument, viz. that all men, jews and gentiles are under &s;in, and the whole world guilty before God, as he proves by particular inductions, from ver&s;e 18 to v. 9th and 19th of the 3d chap. Whence he argues, therefore no man can be ju&s;tified, but in this way of faith in Chri&s;t, in&s;tituted of God. They cannot be ju&s;tified by works, by any law; not by the law of innocency, by the law of nature, nor by the revealed law of the jews, without faith: they are all alike &s;inners, and &s;hut up to the faith of Chri&s;t as their only hope. He al&s;o proves it by this, "every other way makes faith void and the promi&s;e of none effect." Again, that it is a way of &s;alvation opened to all the living world, he illu&s;|trates by the example of Abraham. Furthermore, that it is effectual and in&s;ures &s;alvation to every believer without excep|tion; he &s;hews we have every a&s;&s;uring rea&s;on and inducement to believe. For the moral perfections of God are all harmoni|ou&s;ly di&s;played in this way of ju&s;tification and life; his holine&s;s and ju&s;tice is honoured in it, "for he can now be ju&s;t and the ju&s;tifier of every one who believes in Je&s;us;" his wi&s;dom and grace are mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played in it: all boa&s;ting is ex|cluded from the creature: the highe&s;t honours redound to the mediation, blood, righteou&s;ne&s;s and redemption of Chri&s;t: and this propitiation is &s;et forth for this very purpo&s;e, that the world through faith in it might be &s;aved: and the promi&s;es of God are gloriou&s;ly illu&s;trate in it. And the la&s;t concluding proof of it is the la&s;t ver&s;e of the fourth chapter. It is the grand intention to be an&s;wered by the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t: "who died for our offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification:" who believe, "to the jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the gentile." With this he clo&s;es his proof of the glorious doctrine he &s;et out to evince. And immediately proceeds to his inferences, to illu&s;|trate the importance and glory of it, in an exhibition of the di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges and ble&s;&s;ings accruing to the ju&s;tified believer. And it is for this double purpo&s;e, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of believers, and to recommend it to the world, as worthy of all acceptation, to induce and engage them to believe and be &s;aved. And the peculiar privileges annumerated v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and the 11th ver&s;es are appropriate to believers. It is they, ver&s;e the 11th, who joy in God, through our Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="167" REF="019737_0186_0FACA41CF0F42290">
Chri&s;t, by whom they have now received the atonement: whereby he becomes their covenant God and Father.</P>
<P>This introduces the paragraph in di&s;pute, wherein he is &s;till pur&s;uing the &s;ame &s;ubject, in another method of illu&s;trating the abounding ble&s;&s;ings to believers, viz. as they are derived to them from Chri&s;t their federal head and &s;urety; in a manner &s;imilar to what &s;in and death are conveyed to the natural po&s;t|erity of Adam. For this purpo&s;e he in&s;titutes the compari&s;on between Adam and Chri&s;t; and &s;hews, that by the grace of God, believers receive righteou&s;ne&s;s and life from Chri&s;t with &s;uper-abounding advantage, in &s;everal very important re&s;pects, above and beyond the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained, in the fir&s;t Adam. Now, in this way, the connexion is ea&s;y, clear and &s;trong. And the grand &s;ubject he had been evincing with &s;o much labour; the tenor of his arguments and illu&s;trations; together with the &s;pecial de&s;ign of his inferences in the foregoing context; all naturally, yea nece&s;&s;arily point out this connexion, and lead us to this con&s;truction. It is this con&s;truction only, that illu&s;trates the go&s;pel the power of God to &s;alvation to every one that believes &mdash;that evinces, ju&s;tification by faith the only way of life, ex|clu&s;ive of all others&mdash;that is be&s;t fitted to e&s;tabli&s;h believers in the faith without wavering, again&s;t the force of per&s;ecution and &s;eduction, by temptation or error. It is this alone that recom|mends this doctrine as worthy of all acceptation, and enforces faith as of the la&s;t importance to peri&s;hing &s;inners&mdash;and in a word, that gives every word and &s;entence in the two &s;ides of the compari&s;on, their natural and full force, as applied to each &s;ide of it. In this con&s;truction, as applied to believers, ju&s;tification and ju&s;tification of life, have their full force, as they are always u&s;ed; and need not be forced to mean, the re&s;urrection, the re&s;urrection and &s;anctification, and be predicated of the unbe|lieving that are condemned already, and that are condemned in the great day, in a &s;en&s;e that carries in it the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;ur|dity and contradiction in terms. And what &s;eems &s;ufficient to decide the ca&s;e is, that believers arc characteri&s;tically pointed out to be the per&s;ons intended ver&s;e 17. "for if by one man's offence, death reigned by one, much more" they which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, "&s;hall reign in life by one Je&s;us Chri&s;t." He evidently &s;peaks of what they
<PB N="168" REF="019737_0187_0FACA41DA583D608">
now receive and are the &s;ubjects of, in this pre&s;ent life, as con|nected with a reign in life, in the future world. But it is be|lievers only, that receive abundance of grace (faith and all the concommitant graces of the divine life) and the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s&punc; whereby they are ju&s;tified in this life, as connec|ted with their reign in life, in the world to come: and the&s;e mu&s;t be intended: for, to &s;ay of all gracele&s;s, ungodly men; that live in defiance of all the laws of God and men, that they are recipients of abundance of grace, and the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, every one &s;ees is a &s;taring fal&s;hood and ab&s;urdity. Be&s;ides, this text is evidently parralel with ver&s;e 11th, where believers are de&s;cribed as receiving the atonement: and with John 1.12. "But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them who be|lieve on his name;" where believers are preci&s;ely and charac|teri&s;tically pointed out. And the &s;ame verb "to receive" is employed in each of the&s;e places. And one thing more, which to me confirms this con&s;truction beyond doubt, is, that the apo&s;tle here employs the &s;ame forcible method of arguing, as in ver. 9th and 10th applied to believers: ina&s;much as they are "now" the happy &s;ubjects of this abundance of grace, and the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, whereby they are ju&s;tified, he argues a for|tiori, "much more &s;hall they reign in life, by one Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Can this method of arguing apply to gracele&s;s, wicked men? ina&s;much as they do not receive abundance of grace, nor the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but do de&s;pite to the &s;pirit of grace, and trample under foot the blood of Chri&s;t, that "much more they &s;hall reign in life?" &s;urely it cannot. To which may be added, all the promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance and of a future reign in life, are made to the &s;ubjects and heirs of faith only, through|out revelation: and doubtle&s;s the apo&s;tle doth intend and doth in fact draw his conclu&s;ion upon this well known go&s;pel foun|dation: and therefore believers only can be intended. To &s;up|po&s;e, all final unbelievers and ungodly are here intended as reci|pients of this abundance of grace, is again&s;t the tenor of &s;cripture, which de&s;cribes them ve&s;&s;els of wrath, &amp;c. as a fact, it is gro&s;sly fal&s;e and a horrible ab&s;urdity: and it is &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as there is no evidence, it ever entered into the mind of the apo&s;tle or any man, for &s;eventeen hundred years after it was wrote; and &s;eems
<PB N="169" REF="019737_0188_0FACA41E71C74170">
coined only to &s;erve a purpo&s;e. To &s;uppo&s;e, they are &s;o de|&s;cribed as recipients of it, becau&s;e they will be purified in hell, or in ages of torment after the future judgment; and then will be the recipients of it, and reign in life, as this author doth; is to &s;uppo&s;e a doctrine mo&s;t ab&s;urd and pernicious in it&s;elf; and when this apo&s;tle hath not given any hint in his writings of &s;uch ages of future di&s;cipline; and when at the &s;ame time, it is &s;ubver&s;ive of the grand doctrine in which he gloried, and hath taken &s;o much pains to illu&s;trate and enforce: for accor|ding to this tenet, it is not the go&s;pel accompanied with the power of God, that &s;aves tho&s;e who believe, exclu&s;ive of any other way of ju&s;tification and life: but it is hell fire&mdash; and the tormenting di&s;cipline of ages, that has this mighty pow|er, to &s;ave the unbelieving world, the greater part of mankind, according to this writer. This is to make the apo&s;tle in his inference, to de&s;troy the text, he would illu&s;trate, with all his arguments and labours to &s;upport it: and in&s;tead of recommen|ding and enforcing it, to render it contemptible to the world. Moreover, unle&s;s believers are here intended, the apo&s;tle's con|clu&s;ion, drawn in the next ver&s;e, v. 18, is not true: "There|fore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even &s;o, by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life." By "all men" in this la&s;t clau&s;e, he means, every one who believes, jew or gentle without di&s;tinction or exception, preci&s;ely according to his doctrine, expre&s;&s;ed in the 18th ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter, which he had been illu&s;trating and recommending to the world. This con&s;truction only, pre&s;erves and &s;upports a con&s;i&s;tency in his doctrine, argumentations, illu&s;trations, and inferences in connexion with his grand de&s;ign in the whole, viz. to teach and enforce the go&s;pel way of ju&s;tification and &s;alvation by faith in Chri&s;t, as of the la&s;t importance to all men, and to re|commend it by the infinite advantage of it to believers, in all points of view, both ab&s;olute and comparative. I am not the lea&s;t moved, by the remark of this writer upon Dr. Doddrige's con&s;truction of ver&s;e 11th and the&s;e texts in di&s;pute, as applied to believers. He &s;ays, p. 32. "It can be no other than a flat contradiction to the expre&s;&s; words of the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, to &s;ay, that in the latter part of this compari&s;on, not all men are meant,
<PB N="170" REF="019737_0189_0FACA41F892E1518">
but believers only, that is a few of them." For if the <HI>all</HI> in the two &s;ides of the compari&s;on, includes the all of mankind in each part, who are de&s;igned to be compared, though one part be not &s;o many as the other, yet there is no contradiction, but the ut|mo&s;t propriety in it. He adds, "if any can bring them&s;elves to embrace a &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age, that is attended with &s;o gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity, I &s;ee not but they are prepared to make the &s;crip|ture &s;peak what they plea&s;e." Why &s;o har&s;h and ha&s;ty a cen|&s;ure? In the two &s;ides of a compari&s;on. whether of men or things, there may be more in number of one character and de|nomination, than in the other; and yet the word all, may with the greate&s;t propriety be applied to de&s;cribe and comprehend the whole in each character and denomination, in the two &s;ides compared. Thus if you compare the &s;aved and lo&s;t of mankind by their di&s;tingui&s;hing character, and &s;ay, all men that believe &s;hall be &s;aved; and all men that believe not &s;hall damned; the all men applied to the fir&s;t part, is as properly u&s;ed, though this writer &s;ays they are few, as in the other part, which he &s;up|po&s;es to be many more. So in this text the judgment through the offence may come upon all men univer&s;ally, and the ju&s;ti|fication of life may come upon all believers in Chri&s;t as univer|&s;ally; and the term all men may with &s;tricte&s;t propriety be applied to both &s;ides of the compari&s;on. For different &s;ubjects are treated of in the compari&s;on, Adam and Chri&s;t, with the influence of their tran&s;actions in re&s;pect to mankind. And e&s;|&s;entially different things are predicated of the one and the other, condemnation comes to all his natural po&s;terity by his offence, but ju&s;tification of life comes to all who are Chri&s;t's, "to all his believing &s;eed" as univer&s;ally, through the world. However, as the term all men, in this la&s;t part, hath induced others be|&s;ides this writer, to a con&s;truction of this paragraph, which it will by no means bear, as Dr. Doddridge hath ob&s;erved; I &s;hall endeavour to fix the certainty and propriety of this application of the term all men, to believers only, in this &s;ide of the com|pari&s;on. Previous to which, I would ob&s;erve, this author in|&s;i&s;ts the word "eternal" in the la&s;t &s;entence to the righteous and wicked, ought to have a different con&s;truction, becau&s;e of the difference between the &s;ubjects of it: for which I &s;ee no rea|&s;on. But if &s;o, &s;urely, with far better rea&s;on, the term all men,
<PB N="171" REF="019737_0190_0FACA41FE975E440">
in the two &s;ides of a compari&s;on, where the &s;ubjects are diffe|rent as life and death, condemnation and ju&s;tification of life, may have a different con&s;truction, according to the &s;ubjects treated of. And my rea&s;ons for fixing this con&s;truction, are the&s;e; the connexion and introduction of this paragraph leads to this con&s;truction only, as has been &s;hewn. The apo&s;tle had been inferring the ble&s;&s;ings appropriate to believers, and gives notice he was proceeding to illu&s;trate the &s;ame &s;ubject, by in|troducing it, ver&s;e 12th, with a Wherefore, &amp;c. This author admits it is brought in as a proof or illu&s;tration of what went before p. 29. Another rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, believers are charac|teri&s;ed in the foregoing ver&s;e from which he draws his conclu|&s;ion, of ju&s;tification of life "come upon them in this ver&s;e. And this author allows, the words "they which receive the a|bundance of grace," plainly intends to &s;pecify the per&s;ons on whom it is be&s;towed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 62.</NOTE> And how? but by a characteri&s;ing of them, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, as is done in all other parts of &s;cripture? A further rea&s;on is, becau&s;e this ju&s;tification of life, is every where el&s;e appropriate to believers, and therefore ought to be under&s;tood here in its natural &s;ignification, agree|able to the invariable u&s;e of it in &s;cripture; add to this, we have proved it will bear no other con&s;truction: and e&s;pecially not that given by this writer. We have &s;hewn that the application of it to all the unbelieving and ungodly, involves in it the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities and contradictions, it &s;ubverts the doctrine and rea&s;onings of the apo&s;tle in the foregoing chapters; and it infers the doctrine he rejects with a God forbid; nece&s;&s;ity, therefore obligeth us, as we would vindicate the doctrine of in&s;piration and the character of this great apo&s;tle as a con&s;i&s;tent writer, to reject the application of the term "ju&s;tification of life" to all the unbelieving and ungodly. And it is far more rational to admit a different con&s;truction of the term "all men" in the two &s;ides of a compari&s;on, than to admit &s;uch palpable ab&s;urdities and contradictions: more e&s;pecially, as there is not the lea&s;t impropriety, in applying &s;uch a different con&s;truction, to &s;uch e&s;&s;entially different &s;ubjects. For it is "an invariable rule, the term <HI>all men,</HI> and all other univer&s;al terms, mu&s;t have a more extended or limited con&s;truction, according to the &s;ubject to which they relate and are applied." Therefore the &s;ubject trea|ted
<PB N="172" REF="019737_0191_0FACA420B47542A0">
of and to which they are applied, mu&s;t fir&s;t be attended to, before we can determine whether they are to be under&s;tood in a &s;trictly univer&s;al or limited &s;en&s;e, and how far limited. And it is al&s;o to be noted, the term all men is often, yea, far oftener u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;tament writings, and par|ticularly in St. Paul's, "than in that which is &s;trictly univer&s;al. Therefore we put no new &s;en&s;e upon it, in this con&s;truction, but affix &s;uch a limited &s;en&s;e as is common, and mu&s;t be put upon many texts, unle&s;s we admit gro&s;s fal&s;hoods. This re|mark we &s;hall illu&s;trate in &s;ome texts, they lay &s;tre&s;s upon. And it may be further noted, that Paul him&s;elf, u&s;eth this very phra&s;e "every man" in the &s;ingular number, rather more em|phatical than the plural, in a &s;en&s;e far more limited, than we do in con&s;truing "this ju&s;tification of life" as the appropriate privilege, of believers in all ages and generations. Thus Col. 1.28. "whom we preach, warning 'every man,' and teaching 'every man,' that we may pre&s;ent 'every man' perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." Here the term "every man" is three times u&s;ed in this ver&s;e, and yet it cannot po&s;&s;ibly mean "every individual of the humane race exi&s;ting from the beginning, to the end of the world." It is an evident impo&s;&s;ibility in nature, that the apo|&s;tles could teach and warn the millions of millions that lived and died in the four thou&s;and years, before they were born. And there were millions of their cotemporaries, whom they had no opportunity or advantage, per&s;onally, to teach and warn. All the&s;e are excepted, exclu&s;ive of the million of millions that have been, and now are, and will be after them, to the end of the world, whom they cannot per&s;onally, teach and warn. The preci&s;e meaning then, according to the truth of fact, mu&s;t be this, viz. "they taught and warned every man jew, gentile or chri&s;tian without di&s;tinction or exception of any, as they had opportunity and advantage for it:" and the term "every man" is u&s;ed with utmo&s;t propriety in this intended de&s;cription; and is far more elegant, than to have in&s;erted the de&s;cription at large. And this is the preci&s;e meaning of the term "every creature" in the apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion, and in the account of their execution of it, preaching the go&s;pel "to every creature under heaven," Col. 1.23. And it is the preci&s;e &s;en&s;e, of "all men" in almo&s;t every text where chri&s;tian duty is required to|wards
<PB N="173" REF="019737_0192_0FACA42165EEA9B0">
all men; as will be illu&s;trate in a more proper place.&mdash; Now, in a &s;imilar &s;en&s;e doth he u&s;e it, of believers in this la&s;t part of the compari&s;on: not only to denote all believers, but al&s;o with that note of de&s;cription added chapter fir&s;t, v. 16. "whether they were previou&s;ly 'jew or gentile' without di&s;|tinction or exception." And if this be intended, it is obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight, ALL MEN, is far more elegant than the de&s;cription at full length; and when the &s;ubject is known, it is equally determinate. Add to this, it is altogether agreeable to that &s;hort, conci&s;e, &s;ententious manner he u&s;es, throughout this pa|ragraph; as every one, at once perceives, who is acquainted with the original.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author will probably at once &s;et me off, for one who is prepa|red "to make the &s;cripture &s;peak what &s;en&s;e I plea&s;e:" but he is mi&s;|taken in the man. The con&s;truction given to this paragraph, and the &s;cope of the apo&s;tle, is not newly taken up to &s;erve a turn, nor from an un|due attachment to common expo&s;itors: but is the re&s;ult of diligent &s;earch and enquiry. When I read the books of Dr. Taylor, &s;o magnified in his preface, I was not &s;o captivated with them as this writer: but was much di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;everal things, particularly his ambiguous u&s;e and change of the &s;en&s;e of the &s;ame words, in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;everal different con&s;tructions, interchangeably backwards and forwards. I was morally certain (previous to critical examination) that he mu&s;t be wrong in it, be|fore I could particularly di&s;cover wherein. To me it was certain, &s;uch an accurate writer as Paul, under in&s;piration and giving familiar in&s;truction to the church and world, in matters of the greate&s;t moment, would never write in &s;uch a perplexing and embarra&s;&s;ing manner. This put me upon a diligent &s;tudy of Paul's epi&s;tles, and particularly this to the Romans; to find and "fix his main <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cope," as the true key, whereby the con&s;truction of his words and phra&s;es mu&s;t be governed, as in all wi&s;e, good and con|&s;i&s;tent writers. The con&s;truction I have given is the re&s;ult of this inquiry. And that before I had opportunity of examining that of Dr. Doddridge, with whom I am happy to agree.</NOTE> This I tru&s;t, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that be|lievers only are intended in this la&s;t part of the compari&s;on; and that they are de&s;cribed by the term "all men," with far greater elegance and propriety than they could be by any other that would fully convey his meaning.</P>
<P>We have now laid before the reader, the evidence we propo&s;e to produce, to make evident, Paul never taught the doctrine imputed to him, "that the finally wicked &s;hall reign in life for|ever:" and have made evident, it involves many mo&s;t gro&s;s ab&s;urdities in it. Paul could not &s;o directly contradict his com|mi&s;&s;ion, betray his &s;acred tru&s;t, &s;ubvert the terms of life and

In a word, that Paul &s;hould preach the go&s;pel a glorious in&s;titution of God, whereby all who be|lieve &s;hall be &s;aved, and teach and urge the things of the king|dom of God and of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with great a&s;&s;iduity, pains and pathos, as of the greate&s;t importance to all men; and yet while recommending this grand &s;ubject with all his force, &s;hould at the &s;ame time, pour &s;uch contempt upon it as to teach all the world &s;hall be &s;aved, though they pay no regard to this divine go&s;pel, to the law and authority of this gracious God, in this life, is &s;uch a &s;taring incon&s;i&s;tence, as I &s;hould think no con&s;iderate man, can any more believe, than that a pure foun|tain can i&s;&s;ue forth both pure and foul, &s;weet and bitter &s;treams, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I might now leave this paragraph, but as the author lays great &s;tre&s;s upon it, as a key for the con&s;truction of a paragraph in the 8th chapter of this epi&s;tle, and another in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians 15th chapter where his great &s;trength lies, with others; it may not be improper to &s;hew his own &s;cheme to be &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed otherways, as that it cannot an&s;wer his purpo&s;e or be admitted. In p. 121, he &s;ays, "the apo&s;tle's way of arguing in this paragraph, and in the 8th chapter, is very unlike that of common commentators and chri&s;tian writers; they ground the &s;uffering &s;tate of mankind, on the &s;in they
<PB N="175" REF="019737_0194_0FACA422EE237660">
have been guilty of, having &s;inned in and fell with Adam in his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: whereas, he &s;ays, the apo&s;tle frees mankind from all blame on the account of the offence of their fir&s;t fa|ther, &amp;c. The prote&s;tant doctrine, here intended to be op|po&s;ed, I take to be this, viz. "That all the natural po&s;terity of Adam, were &s;o included in him as their foederal or con&s;tituted head, in the con&s;titution of innocency, that if he had per&s;evered in obedience through the term of trial, the avails and ble&s;&s;ings of it would have redounded to all his po&s;terity, as well as to him&s;elf; and con&s;equently, the natural and legal re&s;ult of his di&s;obedience, righteou&s;ly comes upon all his po&s;terity." It is in this &s;en&s;e (not actively) they maintain they &s;inned in him and fell with him. This &s;entiment &s;eems to be countenanced, at lea&s;t, ver&s;e 19th, "for as by one man's di&s;obedience many were made "con&s;tituted" &s;inners; &s;o by the obedience of one &s;hall many be made "con&s;tituted" righteous:" for how could they be con&s;tituted &s;inners, by a di&s;obedience to that con&s;titu|tion, if they were no way included in it? or in what way, but in the natural and legal re&s;ults of that con&s;titution? how can they all die in Adam, if in no &s;en&s;e they lived in him, any more than a man can be &s;aid to die, who never lived? It is in op|po&s;ition to the &s;entiment above &s;tated, I conceive, this writer mu&s;t mean "mankind are freed from all blame, on account of the offence of their fir&s;t father." How doth this agree with what he a&s;&s;erts page 45? By the la&s;t clau&s;e of ver&s;e 12th, "in whom or upon which, all have &s;inned," he &s;ays, the apo&s;tle means preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, as when he &s;aid, chap. 3.9. "All are under &s;in;" and again, v. 19. "All the world are become guilty before God;" and yet again, v. 23. "All have &s;inned." For if in fact, all men &s;tand in &s;uch a connected rela|tion to Adam and his fir&s;t offence, that in con&s;equence of it, they are all under &s;in and guilty before God, how are they blamele&s;s in re&s;pect hereto? Is not this to confound language, and to make &s;inful, guilty and blamele&s;s, to mean the &s;ame thing? To pa&s;s this, ver&s;e 15th, "for if through the offence of one many be dead," he paraphra&s;es, "for if the many, that is all men, are &s;ubjected to death through the lap&s;e of the one man Adam." Now if they are all &s;ubjected to death through this offence, this offence is the righteous ground of it: but if
<PB N="176" REF="019737_0195_0FACA423A86CDC98">
they are not &s;o con&s;titutionally connected with Adam and this offence, as to be guilty and ju&s;tly liable to it; how is this of|fence the righteous ground of their &s;ubjection to it, any more than the &s;in of angels? Again, ver&s;e 16, "for the judgment was by one, to condemnation," he paraphra&s;es, "for the judi|cial &s;entence took ri&s;e from the lap&s;e of one man, and proceeded to condemnation, condemnation &s;ubjecting mankind to death, and thereupon to &s;in al&s;o." Upon which I would remark&mdash; every righteous, judicial &s;entence is grounded on, and pur&s;uant to &s;ome law or con&s;titution, as the mea&s;ure of it, and cannot extend beyond it, to reach the innocent as well as guilty. This judicial &s;entence is pur&s;uant to the con&s;titution of innocency. Now, if all the po&s;terity of Adam, were ab&s;olutely excluded that con&s;titution, and ab&s;olutely blamele&s;s, in re&s;pect to that offence, which is the ground of this judicial &s;entence pur&s;uant to it, and were &s;o in the eye of the righteous Judge of the world; why is this terrible &s;entence, carrying &s;in and death in it, exten|ded to all this innocent, blamele&s;s po&s;terity? where is the wi&s;|dom, holine&s;s, goodne&s;s, or &s;trict righteou&s;ne&s;s of it, in this view? would the infinitely wi&s;e and good God, when opening an infinitely wi&s;e and perfect government, which in the final i&s;&s;ue of it, &s;hall di&s;play the glory of his moral character in high|e&s;t lu&s;tre, preface the di&s;pen&s;ation of it with a terrible judicial &s;entence, upon millions of millions in his &s;ight, of ab&s;olute in|nocents? is it &s;uppo&s;ible, when he hath revealed the righteous rule of judgment, "he that ju&s;tifieth the wicked, or condemneth the ju&s;t, they are both an abomination to the Lord, Prov. 17. 15. and hath expre&s;sly forbid it in capital ca&s;es among men, as Deut. 24.16. "The fathers &s;hall not be put to death for the children, neither &s;hall the children be put to death for the fa|thers: every man &s;hall be put to death for his own &s;in." Would he &s;et the counter example of this rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the view of the world, reaching to all generations of mankind? it is incredible. The&s;e &s;eem in&s;uperable difficulties in the way of holding them innocent and blamele&s;s in re&s;pect to this offence, in the eye of the righteous Judge. He &s;hifts his po&s;ition, ver. 19th, and tells us, "by the di&s;obedience of the one man Adam, the many or all men in con&s;equence of "a divine con&s;titution" &s;ubjecting them to a frail mortal &s;tate, occa&s;ioned by this di&s;|obedience

of his, became &s;inners," p. 27. Here it is not by judicial &s;entence, as before, but by a "divine con&s;titution" that all men become &s;inners. The&s;e do not agree, exactly: for a judicial &s;entence, and a con&s;titution, are e&s;&s;entially different things: as different, as a con&s;titution, and the legal, judicial effects, of it. He &s;tates his &s;entiment more clearly, in his note upon Rom. 8.20. "for the creature was made &s;ubject to va|nity, not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him, who &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope." He tells us, "though the devil's temptation was the occa&s;ion of &s;in, and &s;in the occa&s;ion of mankind's &s;ub|jection to vanity, and &s;o the devil may (as well as our fir&s;t pa|rents) in a &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to have been the authors of this &s;ub|jection: yet, the will of God, publi&s;hed in the judicial &s;entence, taking ri&s;e from Adam's lap&s;e, was that, and that only, which really &s;ubjected mankind to vanity, (i. e. to &s;in, calamity and death). This will or con&s;titution therefore, thus taking ri&s;e from Adam's lap&s;e, mu&s;t be the thing intended by the apo&s;tle," p. 105. Upon this &s;tating, it is natural to inquire (1.) if A|dam's di&s;obedience was di&s;plea&s;ing and hateful to God, is it credible a holy God, &s;hould take occa&s;ion from that, to make a con&s;titution by which his natural po&s;terity in all generations, &s;hould likewi&s;e be children of di&s;obedience and wrath; if they were in no &s;en&s;e connected with the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? how could this be plea&s;ing to a holy, &s;in-hating God? what pur|po&s;e of wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, goodne&s;s and government could it po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer? (2dly.) If this will and con&s;titution of God is that, only, which &s;ubjects the innocent po&s;terity of Adam to &s;in, calamity and death; who, in true con&s;truction, is the author of all the&s;e moral and natural evils, which reign through the world? not the devil, nor Adam, they are &s;et a&s;ide as occa&s;ional cau&s;es only; and in contradi&s;tinction from them, it is a&s;cribed to the will and con&s;titution of God, as the efficient or effectual cau&s;e, whereby they are &s;ubjected to them; and &s;o &s;ubjected to them "as this damage certainly and univer&s;ally comes into event," as p. 87. Who is the author of this con&s;titution, but a holy God? And upon this plan, to whom are the re&s;ulting evils to be a&s;cribed, as the author, but to him? And can &s;uch an a&s;cription be endured by any who have ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the glorious moral character of God? In vain doth he lay

blame to Adam as having done hurt, as the &s;ource of death, &amp;c. when he takes of the whole, and a&s;cribes it to the will and con|&s;titution of God, only. Upon his plan, notwith&s;tanding any connexion with Adam and his offence, his po&s;terity might have remained innocent, happy and immortal forever. And it is the con&s;titution of God only, made after this offence, which fixes their &s;tate, as it is. (3dly.) Will it not follow, that in the pro|vi&s;ion and promi&s;e of a Saviour to mankind, he viewed all the po&s;terity of Adam, as an innocent, and blamele&s;s race? For this promi&s;e was given, before the judicial &s;entence was pa&s;t; and &s;o before "the con&s;titution" was made or had any exi&s;tence, which only in fact, &s;ubjected them to &s;in and condemnation. So, he &s;ays, "they were &s;ubjected in hope, and con&s;equent upon this promi&s;e," p. 106, 107. Is this credible? that the infinitely wi&s;e God, &s;hould provide and reveal a Saviour, for an innocent race, who needed none, and might upon his plan, have never needed any; but in con&s;equence of an after divine con&s;titu|tion, which &s;ubjected them to &s;in, condemnation and death? Where is divine wi&s;dom and grace to be &s;een in this? The Dr. gives us the true account, they were in the eye of God, without &s;trength, enemies, &s;inners, ungodly, when he purpo&s;ed and contrived the go&s;pel method of ju&s;tification," &s;ermons, p. 149. (4thly.) Upon this plan of their &s;ubjection, by the &s;o|vereign con&s;titution and will of God, will it not follow, that the provi&s;ion and promi&s;e of a Saviour is a matter of ju&s;tice to mankind; and con&s;equently, the riches and glory of go&s;pel grace, &s;o celebrated in &s;cripture, is excluded? This at lea&s;t in part, is implicitly, conceeded by this author: for he tells us, "their being &s;ubjected in hope may &s;ignify, that it was not merely po&s;terior in point of time, to the hope of deliverance, but con&s;equent upon it, in the purpo&s;e of God; and &s;o con&s;e|quent as that he never would have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entence, had he not intended to have given rea&s;on for this hope," p. 106. By hope, he means of their &s;ufferings terminating finally in their &s;uperabounding advantage. For he tells us, "it is this thought only, &s;o far as I am able to judge, that can reconcile the una|voidable &s;ufferings of the race of men, occa&s;ioned by, and taking ri&s;e from, the lap&s;e of their common father Adam, with the per|fections of God, particularly with his infinitely perfect and un|bounded

benevolence," p. 122. If &s;o, it &s;eems the provi&s;ion of a Saviour, and the celebrated grace of the go&s;pel, became a matter of highe&s;t expediency, and indeed of nece&s;&s;ity; for the&s;e two grand purpo&s;es; one is, to repair and make good the dam|age done to the race of men, by this divine con&s;titution (con&s;e|quent upon the lap&s;e of Adam) which &s;ubjected them to their &s;ins and &s;ufferings; the other is, to vindicate the character of the Mo&s;t High, his ju&s;tice and benevolence particularly, from that indelible reproach and di&s;honour by means of this divine con&s;titution, which could not otherwi&s;e, be removed. Where then is the celebrated divine love and grace of the go&s;pel, to mankind? it is removed out of &s;ight, and in&s;hrouded in a cloud of thick darkne&s;s. For is there any grace, in repairing of inju|ries brought upon the innocent and blamele&s;s? e&s;pecially when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the repairer? Is there divine wi&s;dom and perfection exhibited in &s;uch conduct? What ends of wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and government can be an&s;wered by &s;uch repugnant con&s;titutions, the one in|troducing innumerable natural and moral evils upon an inno|cent, blamele&s;s race; and the other repairing of it again, to pre|vent a&s;criptions of di&s;honour, upon the great author? Is this agreeable to the character we have of the infinitely perfect Be|ing? all who&s;e ways are holy, ju&s;t &amp; good, and need no repairs, becau&s;e he never can do injury or wrong to his creatures. Can this be the grace celebrated in the go&s;pel as rich, free, &s;overeign, unbounded, exerci&s;ed to &s;inners, the ungodly, and ju&s;tly con|demned? Can the&s;e things be &s;o, if the happine&s;s of the crea|ture be the grand object? or if the greater object be in view, the eternal celebration of the moral character and government of God, in highe&s;t glory; in connexion with the highe&s;t hap|pine&s;s of his obedient creatures? It is impo&s;&s;ible. Would a wi&s;e and good parent do thus, ruin the moral character and na|tural con&s;titution of all his children, and make them all di&s;obe|dient to parental government, for the offence of one, in which they had no manner of concern, and when he mu&s;t be at a va&s;t expence to repair the damage? Could &s;uch a reparation be magnified, as great wi&s;dom and grace in him? In no wi&s;e. What is it in true con&s;truction, but to a&s;cribe that conduct to the infinitely wi&s;e and good God, which is abominable in man,

"to do evil, that good may come of it," Rom. 3.8. Nor is this all, for (5thly.) upon this plan, the great glory of the re|demption of Chri&s;t, as well as of the love and grace of God, as exhibited in the go&s;pel, is &s;ubverted and overthrown. Chri&s;t teacheth us, that God &s;o loved the world, (a lo&s;t peri&s;hing, ju&s;tly condemned world) that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth on him might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life. In this &s;tating, the love is unutterable, and incomprehen&s;ible. Saint John tells us, "he was manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the works of the devil." But this plan teaches another doctrine, in contradiction to the whole exhibition of the go&s;|pel, viz. That God &s;ent his Son into the world, to repair the damage and remedy the evils, natural and moral, which he him|&s;elf introduced, "by his own judicial &s;entence and divine con|&s;titution, upon all the innocent, blamele&s;s po&s;terity of Adam," not to de&s;troy the works of the devil, or any evils introduced by Adam's di&s;obedience; for the&s;e are &s;et a&s;ide as occa&s;ional, cau&s;es; but it is the evils, to which, the po&s;terity of Adam were in reality &s;ubjected, "by the will and con&s;titution of God, only." Where then is the greatne&s;s of the love of God and of Chri&s;t, to mankind, in this redemption, as a remedy to evils, &s;o intro|duced? What can be more horrible in &s;uppo&s;ition, than that God &s;hould &s;end his only begotten Son, to do and &s;uffer the amazing things reported of him in the go&s;pel, to de&s;troy his own works, "his own divine con&s;titution," with its appendages and effects &s;in and mi&s;ery introduced, upon a blamele&s;s race? I pur&s;ue it no farther, a di&s;cerning reader will &s;ee it full of hor|ror: It carries de&s;truction to the moral character of God, to the grace of the go&s;pel, and to the glories of Chri&s;t's redemption. What doctrine can equal it, but that which makes a holy God the efficient cau&s;e of &s;in? and they both alike totally &s;ubvert and overthrow the glory of the grace of God, and of the re|demption of Chri&s;t, as exhibited in the go&s;pel. We &s;ee this &s;cheme is &s;o far from bringing more honour to God and the Sa|viour, as is pretended, that in various ways it reflects the highe&s;t reproach and di&s;honour. We never &s;ee the glory of this grace and work of redemption, but when we &s;ee it provided and given of God infinitely free, and as effectually relieving and &s;aving &s;inners, the ungodly and ju&s;tly condemned, who exerci&s;e faith

in Chri&s;t, and repentance towards God. How much more ea&s;y, rational and &s;criptural the prote&s;tant faith, in this important article, to view the whole po&s;terity of Adam as included in him as their con&s;tituted head, in the con&s;titution of innocency? The whole vindication of the character, judicial &s;entence and government of God, then centers in one point, only, viz. in vindicating the wi&s;dom, fitne&s;s &amp; goodne&s;s of that con&s;titution as worthy of God, and in it&s;elf, adapted to the great good of mankind. The vindication &s;tands upon the &s;ame ground, and is no more difficult, than that of judicial &s;entences upon crimi|nals among men. If the law and con&s;titution be good, &s;o is a righteous &s;entence pur&s;uant to it. For the genuine, natural, legal and judicial re&s;ult of every wi&s;e, good and righteous con|&s;titution, mu&s;t be righteous. And &s;urely, it is not a hard mat|ter to vindicate that divine con&s;titution as wi&s;ely adapted for the be&s;t good of mankind; by which no evil could en&s;ue; but by the default of the creature: but it is be&s;ide the pre&s;ent de|bate. What hath been &s;aid is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the intention, to &s;erve as a &s;pecimen to &s;hew, that his con&s;truction of this paragraph, and doctrine inferred is &s;o greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, that it cannot an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, nor by any means be admitted.</P>
<P>The text next offered for proof is, Rom. 8th, from the 19th to the 24th ver&s;e. V. 19. "For the earne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God. v. 20. For the creature was made &s;ubject to vanity, not willingly, but by rea&s;on of him who hath &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope: v. 21. Becau&s;e the creature it&s;elf al&s;o &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. v. 22. For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now: v. 23. And not only they, but our&s;elves al&s;o, which have the fir&s;t-fruits of the Spirit, even we our&s;elves groan within our&s;elves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body." It is need|le&s;s to go over his paraphra&s;e and notes, for the whole force of his argument from this paragraph, centers in one point, "in the con&s;truction of creature and whole creation in this pa&s;&s;age." He &s;ays, "mankind univer&s;ally, are the creature and whole creation here intended; the whole rational creation, the whole world of mankind," p. 116 and 117, and &s;hall be delivered in
<PB N="182" REF="019737_0201_0FACA7DC220EB830">
the liberties of the &s;ons of God. If he fails in his proof of this, or we prove the contrary, his argument is totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t take &s;ome notice of his introduction and key; then examine his &s;cripture witne&s;&s;es, that all mankind are in|tended by every creature, or the whole creation, which if I mi&s;take not will te&s;tify the contrary; and I &s;hall add &s;ome con|firming evidence that all mankind cannot be intended by the creature and whole creation in this paragraph. To introduce the connexion, he &s;ays the apo&s;tle had argued, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf and all good chri&s;tians, v. 17. "And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t: if &s;o be we &s;uffer with him, that we may be al&s;o glorified together," he paraphra|&s;es, heirs to &s;ome valuable inheritance, worthy of &s;o great and munificent a father, and joint heirs to it with Chri&s;t, ina&s;much or &s;ince we &s;uffer with him, &amp;c. Why did he not &s;ay, heirs to the promi&s;ed heavenly inheritance, which the apo&s;tle no doubt intended? wherein tho&s;e that &s;uffer with him &amp; on his account, &s;hall be glorified together. In his note, p. 95. he &s;ays, the a|po&s;tle's argument, from &s;on&s;hip to heir&s;hip lies in this, that the children are at pre&s;ent in &s;uffering circum&s;tances. "Since we are children of God, yet in a &s;tate of &s;uffering, we may argue we are heirs to a better &s;tate: thus we may argue now: but when we have attained that glorious &s;tate, we can no longer argue, if children then heirs." Surely, when we are in actual, full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chartered, promi&s;ed inheritance, we have no need to argue about heir&s;hip, it is altogether &s;uper&s;eded by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but this doth not prove the apo&s;tle argues, from &s;ufferings to heir&s;hip. The fallen angels are in a &s;uffering &s;tate, but they cannot infer heir&s;hip, to a better. The apo&s;tle goes upon firmer ground, he argues, from &s;on&s;hip to heir&s;hip, upon the ground of the go&s;pel con&s;titution and promi&s;es of God. So he argues, Gal 3. "they that are of faith, are ble&s;&s;ed with faith|ful Abraham&mdash;are children of God&mdash;and heirs according to promi&s;e." So to the Ephe&s;ians&mdash;in this text and every where el&s;e. And he argues from joint-heir&s;hip with Chri&s;t, and joint-&s;ufferings with him, for his &s;ake, cau&s;e, intere&s;t and kingdom, which are the &s;ufferings &s;pecially intended, to joint-glorification with him; all upon the ground of promi&s;e, and joint-heir&s;hip: which is a very different foundation from mere &s;ufferings: &s;o
<PB N="183" REF="019737_0202_0FACA7DCE2472580">
that his introduction and key is a mi&s;take, and in like manner is his rea&s;onings upon it. Paul argues, v. 18. that "the &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared, with the glory that &s;hall be revealed in us." He remarks, this glory is future, and to &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s of his arguing, the chil|dren of God are heirs to a glory incomparably beyond their &s;ufferings, and to reconcile them to the thought of its being "glory not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but in expectation only, which they mu&s;t patiently wait for," he makes this paragraph to be intro|duced: on which he argues, if the rational creature, mankind in common, are &s;o the &s;ons of God, as that glory &s;hall be revealed to them; much more &s;hall it be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who are the children of God by adoption: and if this whole rational creation mu&s;t come to this glory through &s;ufferings and after long and patient waiting for; the children of God, as partakers of his nature, have no rea&s;on to complain that it mu&s;t be &s;o with them. And &s;ays, upon this ground al&s;o, chri&s;tians may argue a fortiori, that their &s;ufferings will be over-balanced with a future weight of glory, p. 96, 97, and 101. This arguing &s;eems ill founded, and ineffectual to the apo&s;tle's purpo&s;e. In con|clu&s;ive rea&s;oning, the medium of proof is more evident or better known, than the conclu&s;ion produced by it, was before. But in this ca&s;e, the conclu&s;ion inferred, that pre&s;ent &s;ufferings are not to be compared with future glory, is incomparably clearer in go&s;pel promi&s;es and declarations than his medium of proof it|&s;elf, viz. that all the &s;ons of belial &s;hall ever be revealed to be the &s;ons of God. Again, this arguing &s;uppo&s;es, it was a known principle, that the&s;e &s;ons of belial &s;hould be &s;o revealed, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in fact it is a tenet unknown in the church of God and by the a|po&s;tles, in that day &amp; for &s;ome ages afterwards, and it is conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed|ed in the note, p. 253. This arguing &s;uppo&s;es, that it was better known, that all the wicked who are excluded the kingdom of God &s;hould inherit it, than that the &s;ufferings of good chri&s;tians will be overbalanced, with a future weight of glory. It &s;up|po&s;es, it is more obvious that all infidels will be &s;aved, than that the &s;ufferings of good chri&s;tians &s;hall be graciou&s;ly crowned with an overbalancing reward; and con&s;equently it &s;uppo&s;es the doctrine of infidelity, is a more obvious medium by which to infer the peculiar glories of chri&s;tianity, than the plain doctrines
<PB N="184" REF="019737_0203_0FACA7DDA0F2C4C8">
of chri&s;tianity it&s;elf. Paul was too great a divine, and accurate rea&s;oner, to argue in &s;o ab&s;urd a manner. Nor could it an&s;wer his de&s;ign, to &s;upport chri&s;tians in their per&s;ecutions and trials, &s;uffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Chri&s;t, in his glorious cau&s;e. Would Paul ad|dre&s;s his &s;uffering brethren&mdash;"your bloody per&s;ecutors will be revealed the &s;ons of God, as well as you; and they mu&s;t all come to future glory, through &s;uffering, after long and patient waiting for it; and therefore you have no rea&s;on to complain of your &s;ufferings; but with this con&s;ideration you may well indure with meekne&s;s and patience, all their horrid abu&s;e, cru|elty and wickedne&s;s." Upon the &s;tating of it, every one mu&s;t &s;ee the impertinence and ab&s;urdity of it. And it mu&s;t be in|effectual on the other ground al&s;o forementioned: it was a principle unknown to them, and they could not infer &s;upport from it. This arguing is like &s;eeking light in a dungeon, or building a &s;uper&s;tructure without a foundation. I would ob|&s;erve, it is the &s;anctified, adopted children and &s;ons of God, in this world, the apo&s;tle treats of in foregoing ver&s;es and context, as this author allows, it is the&s;e therefore he undoubtedly means "in the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God," v. 19. But this writer includes all the wicked of mankind in it; "the creature mankind, he &s;ays, waits in earne&s;t expectation for the time, when it &s;hall be revealed, that they are the &s;ons of God, by be|ing gloriou&s;ly immortal, p. 92. he foi&s;ts into the text this la&s;t clau&s;e, "when it &s;hall be revealed that they are the &s;ons of God," again&s;t the force of the connexion, and manife&s;t de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, and when it is never &s;o u&s;ed in revelation of the finally ungodly. In &s;upport of his con&s;truction, that the rati|onal creation is intended by the creature in this text, he argues, "if the meaning be extended, to take in the inanimate part of the creation, much more the rational and moral part, ought to be comprehended:" for though on the one hand, the rational part might properly be &s;tiled (pa&s;akti&s;es) the whole creation, without the inanimate part, yet it would be highly incongruous on the other hand, to give this &s;tile to the le&s;s valuable part, leaving out the mo&s;t excellent, p. 98. He &s;ubjoins, "what is mo&s;t worthy of notice is, the phra&s;e pa&s;akti&s;is, every creature, is never u&s;ed (one di&s;puted text excepted, Col. 1. 15.) in all the new te&s;tament, to &s;ignify more than the whole moral crea|tion,
<PB N="185" REF="019737_0204_0FACA7DE60FF0D50" MS="y">
or all mankind," p. 99. I would produce one text, where more than mankind are intended by the word creature, and ano|ther where they are excluded: "Neither height, nor depth, nor any other creature" in the la&s;t ver&s;e of this context certainly means more than all mankind. And in 1 Tim. 4.4. "For (pan kti&s;ma) every creature of God is good, (for food) and nothing to be refu&s;ed, if it be received with thank&s;giving."&mdash; Where the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of food to eat, all mankind are as cer|tainly excluded in the phra&s;e "every creature:" for our oppo|nents would not countenance maneaters. Nor is it any ab&s;ur|dity to &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t excellent part are here excluded; but it would be a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to include them: and perhaps it will appear not le&s;s ab&s;urd to include them in this di&s;puted text.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to cro&s;s examine his po&s;itive &s;cripture witne&s;&s;es. He &s;ays, "'tis remarkable, when the apo&s;tles were commi&s;&s;ioned to preach the go&s;pel to all mankind, the words are Mark 16.15. pa&s;a kti&s;is, every creature. So, when the go&s;pel is &s;aid to have been preached, in con&s;equence of this commi&s;&s;ion, to all mankind, the &s;ame words are u&s;ed, pa&s;a kti&s;is, Col. 1.25. and that the rational creature, or mankind, is the only meaning of the&s;e words, may certainly be collected from Mat. 28.18. and Luk. 24.47. where the go&s;pel is &s;poken of as intru&s;ted with the apo&s;tles to be preached, is panta ethne, "that is, to all nations of men." So that it is the ra|tional creature, the rational creation, or mankind, that the apo&s;tle is here &s;peaking of," p. 99 and 100. here are his witne&s;&s;es and conclu&s;ion in full length. That men are in|tended by every creature" in the&s;e texts, is granted: but that they do not include "all mankind" we &s;hall prove from the texts them&s;elves, and con&s;equently his conclu&s;ion is ill founded. This commi&s;&s;ion is de&s;igned to open a door and way of &s;alva|tion to all nations upon earth, upon the &s;ame footing. And when it is con&s;idered, the jews were the only covenant people of God, under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation; that they were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the notion they always &s;hould be &s;o; and that the gentiles could not become &s;uch, but in becoming jews, by circumci&s;ion, which occa&s;ioned the controver&s;y, recorded Acts 15. and when it is al&s;o con&s;idered, our Lord's mini&s;try was to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and the temporary mini&s;try
<PB N="186" REF="019737_0205_0FACA7DF210AEC60">
of his di&s;ciples in his life time, was likewi&s;e limited. The&s;e particulars &s;hew us the wi&s;dom and propriety of the clear, ex|ten&s;ive, deci&s;ive and comprehen&s;ive language of the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion, whereby they are now authori&s;ed to preach the go&s;|pel to all nations, jew or gentile, &s;cythian, barbarian, bond or free, as annumerated by Paul, without di&s;tinction or exception. But this is a very different thing from all mankind, in their &s;en&s;e: for the words of the commi&s;&s;ion and the promi&s;e of &s;up|port, &s;hew it limited to mankind upon earth. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature," &s;ays Mark the fir&s;t witne&s;s: "Go ye therefore teach all nations," &s;ays Matthew: "That repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jeru&s;a|lem," &s;ays Luke. Nothing is more evident, than that they were to go from Jeru&s;alem &amp; preach to the nations then living, and every creature in them, as they had opportunity for it; and were to inforce it with "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned," Mark 16.16. They had no commi&s;&s;ion to preach to the million of millions that lived and died in the four thou&s;and years before they were born, to none of mankind in heaven, nor to any in hell; which would have been impo&s;&s;ible to them, while living on earth: and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the mini&s;try, in all ages, are to preach it in like manner, to every humane creature of their cotemporaries, as they have opportunity for it. And the promi&s;e of our Saviour, "Lo I am with you to the end of the world," Mat. 28.20. &s;hews that the commi&s;&s;ion will end, and be no more, at the end of the world. So that "every creature" and "all nations" in the commi&s;&s;ion, cannot po&s;&s;ibly include all mankind from the be|ginning to the end of the world, con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of it, and the truth of fact. Moreover, the apo&s;tles certainly ful|filled their commi&s;&s;ion in their day, according to the full im|port of "every creature:" and their next witne&s;s will give us the preci&s;e meaning of it: Col. 1.23. "and be not moved away from the hope of the go&s;pel which ye have heard, and which was preached to 'every creature' which is under heaven." Their commi&s;&s;ion was fulfilled, not by preaching to all man|kind, from the beginning to the end of the world, which is im|po&s;&s;ible, and is contrary to fact, but it was to every humane
<PB N="187" REF="019737_0206_0FACA7DFE2BAD2C8" MS="y">
creature under heaven, as they had opportunity for it: which therefore is the preci&s;e meaning of their commi&s;&s;ion: and al&s;o, of "teaching every man and warning every man" without di&s;|tinction or exception, as ver&s;e 28 of the &s;ame chapter, as before noted. Wherefore the&s;e texts, when allowed to &s;peak for them|&s;elves, do not prove their all mankind, and whole rational cre|ation, but witne&s;s the contrary, in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive manner. If therefore this di&s;puted text be parallel with them, it cannot po&s;&s;ibly mean all mankind; nor is the phra&s;e u&s;ed in that com|prehen&s;ive and exclu&s;ive &s;en&s;e, in all the new te&s;tament. Their con&s;truction is fully confuted by their own witne&s;&s;es. I &s;hall now proceed to add &s;ome confirming evidence, that all man|kind cannot be intended by the creature, in this paragraph: and this is evident, (1.) becau&s;e the apo&s;tle holds up a di&s;tinc|tion and disjunction through the whole, between the crea|ture, and the &s;ons of God; are not the &s;ons of God a part, and very important part of the rational, moral creati|on? Certainly. If &s;o, and the term creature, intends the whole moral creation, they mu&s;t be included, and cannot be di&s;connected and disjoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from it. But this di&s;con|nexion and disjunction between the creature and the &s;ons of God runs through the whole paragraph. The creature "has earne&s;t expectation, waits, groans, travails in pain, is delivered from the bondage of corruption in the liberties of the &s;ons of God." "And the &s;ons of God, they that have the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, in way of di&s;tinction and disjunction from the creature, groan and wait for the adoption, the redemption of the body." Wherefore, their con&s;truction of the term creature, is again&s;t the &s;pirit and language of the paragraph, and holds up an ab&s;urd contradiction in it, viz. that the &s;ons of God are both included and excluded in the &s;ame term, which is a manife&s;t contradiction and ab&s;urdity. A 2d. rea&s;on, why the finally wicked cannot be intended by the creature in the text, is, becau&s;e the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the apo|&s;tle for the earne&s;t expectation and waiting of the "creature" for the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, is no rea&s;on or cau&s;e, why they &s;hould de&s;ire and wait for it. The rea&s;on here a&s;&s;ign|ed for it is, becau&s;e the creature it&s;elf &s;hall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, "in the liberty of the glory of the
<PB N="188" REF="019737_0207_0FACA7E0A33FA2C8">
&s;ons of God:" that is, in the time of their manife&s;tation. Now the &s;cripture teaches but two manife&s;tations of the &s;ons of God; one in Chri&s;t's glorious reign in this world, in which by &s;uppo|&s;ition, they are not delivered; the other, in the re&s;urrection and la&s;t judgment; when the &s;ons of God will be exhibited to the intelligent creation, in all their glory, and Chri&s;t will be glori|fied in, and with them. To this, the apo&s;tle has &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efer|ence&mdash; this magnificent "adoption &amp; redemption of the body," We read of no after manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, nor can it be expected; for then "&s;hall they be caught up to heaven, and be ever with the Lord." All hope of any after manife&s;ta|tion of them, is excluded by this text, and the current doctrine of &s;cripture. Now it is certain, in this final manife&s;tation of the adopted &s;ons of God, in the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t, the finally di&s;obedient will not be delivered from the bondage of corruption, in the glorious liberties of the &s;ons of God; for their re&s;urrection will be to damnation, as taught by our Saviour, and allowed by this author: and con&s;equently they cannot be the creature that hath earne&s;t expectation, and waits for this manife&s;tation, for they will have no deliverance and benefit by it. This author takes for granted, "that all mankind are in|tended by the creature, and that they are all to be revealed to be the &s;ons of God, by being gloriou&s;ly immortal, and &s;hall be delivered into the liberties of the &s;ons of God;&mdash;and argues from one part, to the other in a circle to &s;upport it; without any &s;upporting, concluding evidence, of any one part of it. The text gives not the lea&s;t hint of their doctrine, but fully con|futes it. The creature that will ever be delivered, will have this deliverance in the time of the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God; but in his final manife&s;tation of them, the finally wicked will not be delivered; after which, there is no deliverance. Their con&s;truction intirely annuls &amp; de&s;troys the rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign|ed, for the creatures expectation, and waiting for the manife&s;t|ation of the &s;ons of God, in every view. The finally wicked will have no deliverance in their final manife&s;tation: and if it be &s;uppo&s;ed they will have deliverance in &s;ome after di&s;pen&s;ati|ons, yet this affords no cau&s;e or rea&s;on why they &s;hould earne&s;tly de&s;ire, expect and wait for this previous manife&s;tation. For this final manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God expre&s;&s;ed in the text,
<PB N="189" REF="019737_0208_0FACA7E1611A4DE0">
hath no &s;ort of connexion with &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed after deliverance: no, not in time, means, place, or worlds, to be any ground or cau&s;e, why they &s;hould &s;o de&s;ire and wait for it. The cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned, and connexion of things in the paragraph is ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, by &s;uppo&s;ing the finally di&s;obedient are intended, by the creature. It is &s;o far from being true, that all mankind are included, that they are ab&s;olutely excluded, from being the creature here intended. The &s;ons of God are excluded by a disjunctive de&s;cription thro' the whole: and the finally wicked are excluded by the cau&s;e of the creature's waiting, expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igned; which cannot agree to them. A 3d. argument, a|gain&s;t their con&s;truction and doctrine is, that it is directly re|pugnant to the main &s;ubject of the apo&s;tle, and to the tenor and &s;cope of his di&s;cour&s;e in the foregoing and &s;ub&s;equent part of the context, in which this paragraph is in&s;erted. The apo&s;tle of &s;et purpo&s;e, is treating of the di&s;tingui&s;hing character, &s;tate, privileges and happine&s;s of the &s;anctified, adopted &s;ons of God, in the foregoing and &s;ub&s;equent part of this chapter, through|out. He in&s;erts many characteri&s;tic marks and rules, whereby this great di&s;tinction in character, &s;tate and happine&s;s may be known; as every one may &s;ee at fir&s;t view, in reading of it. There is not a chapter in revelation more intirely taken up with this important &s;ubject. And it mu&s;t be allowed, that there is not a more certain key of con&s;truction, to every con&s;i&s;tent writer, than his main &s;ubject and de&s;ign: every doubtful word, phra&s;e and &s;entence mu&s;t be con&s;trued into a con&s;i&s;tency with that. Now, is it po&s;&s;ible, when Paul from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t ver&s;e of this chapter, is holding forth a grand, e&s;&s;ential and mo&s;t important di&s;tinction in character, &s;tate, privileges, and happi|ne&s;s in this world &amp; the eternal, between the &s;anctified in Chri&s;t and the re&s;t of mankind; that in the middle of it, he &s;hould &s;top &s;hort, in a full and flat contradiction to the &s;ubject matter, &s;cope and tenor of the whole? that then he &s;hould annul all his rules of trial, throw down all di&s;tinction of character and &s;tate between them, and put all mankind upon the &s;ame footing for eternity? Can it be, that he &s;hould roundly a&s;&s;ert that all the &s;ons of belial and wickedne&s;s, in earth and hell, &s;hould be alike gloriou&s;ly immortal, with the &s;anctified in this world, in the time when the&s;e &s;ons of God are manife&s;ted in their di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
<PB N="190" REF="019737_0209_0FACA7E22B78BD08">
glory, in this world, or the redemption of their bodies? for in this paragraph they are cotemporary, coincident events. Can he here a&s;&s;ert this of all the wicked, in full contradiction to his own doctrine in the 6th and 13th ver&s;es, "to be carnally minded is death;" "if ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die:" al&s;o in contradiction to his account of the la&s;t judgment; that then "the di&s;obedient &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction;" and in direct oppo&s;ition to the plain doctrine taught throughout revelation? this &s;urely cannot be. What is it but to confound all language and &s;entiment; to &s;et up di&s;tinctions of character, &s;tate, privileges and happine&s;s, and then to demo|li&s;h the whole again with a &s;troke; and in effect to teach us that the infinitely wi&s;e, holy, righteous and good Governour and Judge of the world, has no regard to vertue or vice, or to cha|racters formed by the one or the other in this world: but the &s;ons of God, and of belial &s;tand upon the &s;ame footing of favour with God, and their end will be the &s;ame? this is impo&s;&s;ible. It reflects the highe&s;t reproach upon the character of God, of the apo&s;tle, and &s;pirit of in&s;piration. (4thly.) Their con&s;truc|tion and doctrine is evidently fal&s;e, becau&s;e it is directly repug|nant to the de&s;ign of this paragraph, as an argument of &s;upport to &s;uffering chri&s;tians in all their per&s;ecutions and trials in this world. This is evidently the de&s;ign of it; for after de&s;cribing the appropriate happine&s;s of good chri&s;tians, in their relation to God as children, and to Chri&s;t as joint heirs, and a&s;&s;urance of the heavenly glory as founded in it, ver. 17th, "and if children then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t; if &s;o be that we &s;uffer with him, that we may al&s;o be glorified together." He adds, "for I reckon, that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which &s;hall be revealed in us." Then comes in this paragraph in di&s;pute: "for the earne&s;t expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife&s;|tation of the &s;ons of God." A very different time from the "pre&s;ent" is coming on, when there will be a grand exhibition of an innumerable multitude of "the &s;ons of God" out of all nations: when the kingdom of Chri&s;t, for which you and we &s;uffer, will be gloriou&s;ly triumphant over all the nations and kingdoms of this world: and chri&s;tians, &s;o far from a &s;tate of reproach and &s;ufferings, as at pre&s;ent, will then appear in dig|nity
<PB N="191" REF="019737_0210_0FACA7E2E2053E68">
and honour, "the glory of Chri&s;t," and ruling the world. And this will reflect great glory, upon tho&s;e of us, who have previou&s;ly &s;uffered in &s;upport of this glorious cau&s;e, and lead the van of this illu&s;trious army; and may well &s;upport and ani|mate us in it. For it is a cau&s;e of &s;uch va&s;t magnitude, that not only innumerable numbers of mankind, to be delivered and revealed in the glorious liberties of the &s;ons of God, are mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;upport, progre&s;s, &s;ucce&s;s and i&s;&s;ues of it; but it is intere&s;ting to the whole vi&s;ible, inferior creation. So that this whole inferior creation may, by an ea&s;y, &s;trong fi|gure, be &s;aid to be earne&s;tly expecting and waiting for it. For this &s;elf-&s;ame creature, now &s;ubject to vanity and great abu&s;e, which may be &s;aid to groan and travel in pain, under the tyran|ny and manifold abu&s;e of the wicked of the earth, contrary to the end of its creation, "&s;hall be delivered from this bondage of corruption," in the time and by the means "of the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The original is literally, "in the liberty of the glory of the &s;ons of God." I am &s;en&s;ible a noun genetive put adjectively, is often the mo&s;t elegant con&s;truction: but in this ver&s;e the literal one, may be&s;t point out the time and in&s;trumental cau&s;ality, of their deliverance from their ba&s;e va&s;&s;alage and &s;ugge&s;t a &s;timilus to it, viz. it is by means of that divine noblene&s;s and liberality of &s;pirit, which &s;ets them above evil and cruelty, and excites them to do good to all creatures, as they have opportunity; and is "the glory of the &s;ons of God."</NOTE> and &s;hall participate according to its nature, of the glory and ble&s;&s;ings of that &s;tate, when the cur&s;e is removed, and plentiful ble&s;&s;ings will be poured out from hea|ven, upon this lower creation. And not only doth the whole inferior creation travail in pain for the birth of this great event which will attend the go&s;pel and cau&s;e for which we &s;uffer in this world; but our&s;elves al&s;o, the chri&s;tian world, and tho&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence in it, "who have received the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit," "even we our&s;elves, groan within our&s;elves, ear|ne&s;tly looking and waiting for a &s;till more glorious manife&s;ta|tion and adoption, in the view of the intelligent creation, at the redemption of our body;" when a di&s;tingui&s;hing reward will be given, and glory be revealed in and upon tho&s;e who have &s;uffered with Chri&s;t, as v. 18. In this view this paragraph carries weighty argument of &s;upport to &s;uffering chri&s;tians. What could be better adapted, than to addre&s;s to them the va&s;t

And it is in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame &s;upport given to the church of God by the prophets, who pre|dicted the&s;e glorious times, in &s;trong, lively and energetic de|&s;criptions, and by our Saviour in his parables, which &s;et forth the triumphant progre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of his go&s;pel and kingdom in the world, and which are more particularly and &s;trongly &s;et forth in his revelations to St. John. Will their con&s;truction and doctrine an&s;wer as a &s;upport to &s;uffering chri&s;tians? How? what, to tell them that all the reprobate &s;ons of belial and wick|edne&s;s, in earth and hell, are waiting with earne&s;t expectation the manife&s;tation and glorious adoption of the &s;ons of God, and &s;hall have part in it? To tell them, that all who pay no regard to the &s;acred cau&s;e for which they &s;uffer, but live in plea&s;ure, ca&s;ting off all regard to God and religion, and live and die ene|mies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, "&s;hall be revealed to be the &s;ons of God, by being made gloriou&s;ly immortal? yea more, to tell them, that their tyrannie, blood-thir&s;ty per&s;ecutors, tho&s;e roar|ing lions, ranging bears, and devouring wolves, wor&s;e than common bea&s;ts of prey, who were worrying and hurrying them by hundreds and thou&s;ands, as lambs to a bloody execution; were all waiting with earne&s;t expectation, were groaning and travelling in pain, for their manife&s;tation and glorious adopti|on; when "they that groan, &s;hall groan no more," but &s;hall be delivered with them&s;elves, in the liberties of the &s;ons of God? No doctrine could better &s;uit the devil and his wicked in&s;tru|ments. But &s;urely, it is cold frozen comfort to the godly, under per&s;ecution. It carries in it a death chill to the &s;ufferers, and to the cau&s;e for which they &s;uffer. What is it but to tell them, there is no judgment: no redre&s;s of their wrongs: that it is vain to &s;erve the Lord: that their &s;ufferings are fruitle&s;s; for in the time of their manife&s;tation as the &s;ons of God, their ene|mies will be gloriou&s;ly immortal as well as they: for it mu&s;t be at that time, if ever, according to this text.

Wherefore, their con&s;truction and doctrine, be|ing &s;o directly repugnant to the whole &s;cope of the context, and to the argument of &s;upport and comfort to &s;uffering chri&s;|tians de&s;igned in this paragraph, is evidently fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. I will only &s;ubjoin, all mankind cannot be intended by the creature, for it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;cription here given of it, and with the truth of fact. One part of the de&s;cription
<PB N="194" REF="019737_0213_0FACA7E522519D30">
is v. 20. "for the creature was made &s;ubject to vanity, not wil|lingly," which this author con&s;trues "not through any fault of its own." Now this cannot be true of mankind univer&s;ally, for it is certain Adam and Eve were &s;ubjected to condemnation for their own fault: and it is as certain as words can make it, that the creature mankind is &s;ubject to condemnation, &s;in and death, by the &s;in, faulty offence, and di&s;obedience of the one man Adam, Rom. 5.12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. If the words <HI>amar|tia, paraptoma,</HI> and <HI>parakoes,</HI> &s;in, offence and di&s;obedience, do not &s;ignify fault in the creature, there are no words in any lan|guage that can convey and fix it. Now it is by "&s;in" the fir&s;t word, that death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, v. 12. and it is by and through the offence, the &s;econd word, that judgment is come upon all men "to condemnation," v. 15, 16, 17, 18. and by di&s;obedience, the la&s;t word that many are made &s;inners, v. 19. It is true, this &s;ubjection of mankind, comes through the medi|um of the righteous &s;entence of the holy and righteous judge of the world, grounded upon the faulty offence of the creature; and it is this which deci&s;ively di&s;tingui&s;heth it from that &s;ub|jection by &s;overeign act and arbitrary con&s;titution, whereby the inferior part of the creation, without fault of its own, are &s;ub|jected to vanity, as is intended in this text. Men may u&s;e am|biguous words, &s;uch as "occa&s;ion" "taking ri&s;e," &amp;c. and may &s;huffle with them &s;o as to di&s;gui&s;e facts, but cannot alter them. It will appear from the apo&s;tle's words, to every unbia&s;&s;ed ju|dicious per&s;on, that the creature mankind is &s;ubjected to con|demnation, by and through the &s;in and fault of the creature man, and therefore cannot be intended in this ver&s;e 20. The &s;ophi&s;try to evade it is ea&s;ily expo&s;ed. E. g. A man dies a vi|olent death for murder,&mdash;&s;ays a by&s;tander, this man was not &s;ubject to this death by any fault of his own. Why not? he &s;urely dies "for his own iniquity," in the very &s;en&s;e of the law of God. He replies, it is true, he committed the offence, and &s;o the devil that tempted him, as well as him&s;elf, may be &s;aid to be the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of this death: but the fact is, the judgment took ri&s;e from the offence, and proceeded to condem|nation, and it is the judicial &s;entence of the judge that condem|ned him to it, and that only, that really &s;ubjected him to this death. The futility of it is obvious. According to this argu|ing,
<PB N="195" REF="019737_0214_0FACA7E5E0EF0BA8">
no man could ever die for his own iniquity. For accord|ing to the law of God and man, &s;uch death ought to, and mu&s;t come through the medium of a judicial &s;entence. Nor can the other part of the de&s;cription of the creature, v. 20. "who hath &s;ubjected the &s;ame in hope" agree but to the inferior part of the creation. It is they only that &s;hall be delivered from the bon|dage of corruption, in the time of the manife&s;tation of the &s;ons of God, as before &s;hewn. To &s;ay that all the wicked of man|kind are &s;ubjected in hope of a glorious immortality, is to con|tradict the whole tenor of revelation, and the &s;pirit and language of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, which limits the hope of it to the believing, the penitent and &s;anctified in this world; and is con|futed by many as plain texts, as any in revelation. Again, the &s;everal parts of the de&s;cription of the creature and whole crea|tion, will by no means agree to the whole moral creation and mankind univer&s;ally. Is it true that tho&s;e who are without God in the world, are &s;ubjected in hope; when Paul tells us expre&s;sly they are without hope in the world? Is it true of the wicked cut off in wrath, who&s;e hope peri&s;heth at death, that they are &s;ubjected in hope? Is it true of tho&s;e who live in plea&s;ure, riot in wickedne&s;s, and drink in iniquity like water, and refu&s;e the go&s;pel means of deliverance, that they are groan|ing and travelling in pain for deliverance from their bondage? Is it true of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, that they are groaning under the burthen of corruption, and travelling in pain? or is it true of the di&s;obedient &s;pirits in pri&s;on, that they are waiting with earne&s;t expectation, for the manife&s;tation and adoption of the &s;ons of God, at the re&s;urrection, when their own re&s;urrection will be to damnation? Reduce it to fact, and it is exceeding evident their con&s;truction of creature, and whole creation, is every way fal&s;e, ab&s;urd, again&s;t the truth of fact and tenor of &s;cripture. The word of God never deals in error, nor confu&s;ion: it never repre&s;ents the whole moral world (except in their &s;tate of degeneracy and condemnation) as of one chara|cter, nor in one &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery: but con&s;tantly holds up a mo&s;t clear di&s;tinction between the righteous and wicked, in character and &s;tate in this world&mdash;at death&mdash;in the re&s;urrection and la&s;t judgment, and in their de&s;tination to eter|nity, as different as heaven and hell. On the whole, to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="196" REF="019737_0215_0FACA7E6A13F7D68">
the creature and whole creation, to mean all mankind, and the de&s;cription given of it literally; we plainly &s;ee it to be every way fal&s;e, in fact. If we under&s;tand it of the inferior part of the creation, and the de&s;cription figurative, it gives not the lea&s;t countenance to their error; and therefore it affords not a &s;hadow of &s;upport to their ab&s;urd doctrine.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make a brief remark upon his argument, "from tho&s;e who have received the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit," in this and &s;ome other texts. He argues thus, the apo&s;tle "certainly alludes to the jewi&s;h cu&s;tom of offering the fir&s;t fruits of their increa&s;e; which oblation &s;anctified not only the&s;e fruits, but all the re&s;t." And &s;uppo&s;es the gifts and graces they had received, to be a &s;pecimen, pledge, or earne&s;t of what would be be&s;towed upon the re&s;t of mankind; and that the whole race of men were the following harve&s;t. It is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, the offering of the fir&s;t fruits, &s;anctified the re&s;t of the pre&s;ent harve&s;t, but no more. To make his argument from this allu&s;ion clear, and his con|clu&s;ion &s;trong, he mu&s;t &s;hew that the offering of the fir&s;t fruits, not only &s;anctified the re&s;t of the pre&s;ent harve&s;t, but likewi&s;e all the preceeding harve&s;ts up to the beginning of the world; and al&s;o, all &s;ucceeding harve&s;ts to the end of it. This he can never prove: it is confuted by the in&s;titution it&s;elf, which was annual. As to his other texts, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, the believing jews and gentiles of that day were a &s;ort of fir&s;t fruits, as an earne&s;t and in&s;uring pledge of the ingathering of the ful|ne&s;s both of the jews and gentiles, including all nations, into the kingdom of God, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of it in this world; as predicted by the prophets.</P>
<P>We now pa&s;s to his twin texts: Col. 1.19, 20. "For it plea&s;ed the Father that in him all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell: and (having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s) by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf; by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And Ephe&s;. 1.9, 10. Having made known unto us the mi&s;tery of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure, which he purpo&s;ed in him&s;elf: that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him." By heaven in the&s;e texts, this au|thor under&s;tands the aerial heaven which &s;urrounds the earth;
<PB N="197" REF="019737_0216_0FACA7E761714780">
by earth, the earth it&s;elf and all things that appertain to it: and by "reconciling all things in them" the renovation or rechang|ing the vi&s;ible heavens and earth, with all men and things in them; according to Dr. Thomas Burnet's theory of the new heavens and earth. A con&s;truction, which is as foreign to the de|&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, as Sir I&s;aac Newton's principia of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, and not &s;o well founded in truth. His &s;cheme of the re&s;urrection, millenian world, and new heavens and earth, needs no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion here, as I tru&s;t it will be &s;ufficiently confuted in another place. The&s;e texts rightly under&s;tood, are &s;o far from helping their cau&s;e, that I apprehend, taken in connexion with other things &s;aid in the&s;e epi&s;tles, they afford a deci&s;ive argu|ment again&s;t it. Mr. White's con&s;truction of "reheading all things in Chri&s;t," to me appears preferable to this author's. But "the all things in heaven and upon earth" mu&s;t not be taken in his unbounded &s;en&s;e: no, they are limited by the &s;ub|ject he is treating of, viz. "to all things which have been, now are, and ever will be reconciled and ingathered, as his body, in Chri&s;t their head:" whether they be now in heaven with Chri&s;t, or on earth. In the diction of the texts, it &s;eems "the all that are reconciled by him&s;elf, and to him&s;elf;" and "the all that are reheaded in him, whether in heaven or earth "are compre|hen&s;ively intended. And how are they reconciled to God in him, and gathered together in him as their head, but in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel as the means, and by the medium of faith in him? The &s;cripture points out this, and no other way: con&s;equently, all that ever will be reconciled and inga|thered, will be &s;o in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. And what to me con|firms the above-given con&s;truction, is this, that the apo&s;tle is (ex pro&s;e&s;&s;o) treating of true believers, and of the church as his body, of which Chri&s;t is the head, in both the contexts.&mdash; Thus he addre&s;&s;es to the Ephe&s;ians, as "&s;aints and faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us," v. 1. as ble&s;&s;ed with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Chri&s;t, v. 2. as prede&s;tinated by God, to the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto him&s;elf, v. 5. as made accepted in the beloved, v. 6. as having redemption and for|givene&s;s of &s;ins, v. 7. and as "believers who were &s;ealed with the holy Spirit of promi&s;e, which is the earne&s;t of their inheri|tance, until the redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion," v. 13,
<PB N="198" REF="019737_0217_0FACA7E841C0B330">
14. "who&s;e faith in Chri&s;t and love to the &s;aints" he had heard of, v. 15. and concludes the chapter with this de&s;cription of Chri&s;t, "as head over all things to the Church," which is his body, the fulne&s;s of him that filleth all in all," v. 22, 23. It is his church explicitly and deci&s;ively that is "his body," and "his fulne&s;s" as &s;uch, and not all the lap&s;ed race of Adam. He is head over all things in the univer&s;e as &s;upreme Lord and Governor, and for the benefit of his church; but in contradi&s;|tinction from all the re&s;t of our lap&s;ed race, &amp; all other things, "the church only, is his body." In the &s;ame manner is his addre&s;s to the Colo&s;&s;ians, "to the &s;aints and faithful brethren, at Colo&s;&s;e&mdash;he gives thanks and prays for them, &s;ince he had heard of their faith in Chri&s;t, and love to all the &s;aints;" for the hope laid up for them in heaven, and not in the new earth, v. 2, 3, 4, 5. he gives thanks for them as made meet for the inhe|ritance of the &s;aints in light: as delivered from the power of darkne&s;s, and tran&s;lated into the kingdom of Chri&s;t: "as having redemption through his blood, and forgivene&s;s of &s;ins," v. 12, 13, 14. Surely the&s;e are de&s;criptions which do not belong to all the lap&s;ed &s;ons of Adam. And what is to be particularly noted is, that he introduces the text in di&s;pute, with the de&s;cription of Chri&s;t as head of the church, "his body," v. 18. "and he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the fir&s;t born from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre|eminence." Then comes in the&s;e words, "for it plea&s;ed the Father," &amp;c. I &s;hould think it manife&s;t to every eye, that he gives not a hint in either context of a new heaven and earth, nor is he treating of all the lap&s;ed race of Adam, but preci&s;ely and deci&s;ively of believers, and of the church as the body of Chri&s;t, in contradi&s;tinction from an unbelieving and ungodly world. If we pay attention to the &s;ubject matter treated of in both contexts, and the connexion in which this la&s;t text is introdu|ced, it &s;eems mo&s;t natural, yea nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the all things in heaven and earth, to mean all the reconciled to God, and ingathered out of all nations into Chri&s;t their head "by faith in him;" and as comprehending the whole of this happy body. And it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, the term "all things," &s;o applied, to comprehend all of this denomination and de&s;cription of recon|ciled and ingathered in heaven and earth, whatever their previ|ous
<PB N="199" REF="019737_0218_0FACA7E90D81F260">
character might be, whether jew or greek, barbarian, &s;cy|thian, bond or free, as annumerated, Col. 3.10, 11. is both elegant and emphatical. The above exhibition of the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle in the&s;e two chapters, will lead us to a clear de|ci&s;ive &s;en&s;e of "Chri&s;t's filling all things." It is but twice u&s;ed, and both times in this epi&s;tle, and in both alike, with re&s;pect to the church "his body." "Who is head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulne&s;s of him that filleth all in all." Take it in its connexion in the &s;entence, and with his de&s;ign in the context, and it &s;eems evidently de&s;igned to teach us, what Chri&s;t is to his church in the di&s;pen&s;ation of his king|dom in this world; by communication of gifts and grace to in|gather, pre&s;erve, edify, and build it up to the everla&s;ting king|dom of God. And the apo&s;tle's illu&s;tration of it in this &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t fix it deci&s;ively, as ch. 4.10, 11, 12, 13. "he that de&s;cen|ded, is the &s;ame al&s;o that a&s;cended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things." How? he proceeds to &s;hew, "and he gave &s;ome, apo&s;tles; and &s;ome, prophets; and &s;ome, evangeli&s;ts; and &s;ome, pa&s;tors and teachers; for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying the body of Chri&s;t: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t." It is evident the&s;e gifts are imparted for the ingathering and edification of the church, the body of Chri&s;t in this world; and that they are pe|culiar and appropriate to the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel; which will come to a period at the end of the world; as is allow|ed, p. 266. and "Chri&s;t's filling all things," is his imparting the&s;e gifts, with his grace for this important purpo&s;e. And con|&s;equently, his whole work of filling all things, will be complea|ted, at the end of the world. But this author con&s;trues it, "a filling all the lap&s;ed race of Adam, and he will go on imparting gifts to this end, in future di&s;pen&s;ations, until every individual of the human race comes to the unity of the faith," &amp;c. p. 154, 5. without a &s;hadow of proof, again&s;t the force of connexion, and the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle as explained by him&s;elf. I would remark, from what hath been &s;aid, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, Mr. Relly's &s;cheme of the union of all mankind to Chri&s;t, as his body, is altogether un&s;criptural and palpably erroneous: for the church

con&s;i&s;ting of believers, and as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the un|believing world, are repre&s;ented in the above texts, and in all the apo&s;tolic epi&s;tles, as "the body of Chri&s;t." Our Saviour, in his mini&s;try, held up the di&s;tinction mo&s;t clearly: he cha|racteri&s;es his &s;heep as tho&s;e "that are called; and lead out by him, that know his voice and follow him "as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the world," Joh. 10.3, 4. and he &s;peaks of his di&s;ci|ples "as not of the world, as he was not; and as hated by the world, becau&s;e they hated him," Joh. 15.18, 19. and cha. 17.14. and &s;ays expre&s;sly, v. 9. "he prays not for the world, but for tho&s;e given him, for all who believe," v. 20. And the world in the &s;en&s;e here intended, we are taught by Paul, will be con|demned in the great day. Now, is Chri&s;t hated by his body, will he not pray for, but condemn his body, in the great day? how ab&s;urd? And "they that are Chri&s;t's," is a de&s;cription of true believers, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the world, 1 Cor. 15.23. And what is &s;pecially to be noted is, that all the promi&s;es, and great privileges of redemption are every where appropriated to them who are in Chri&s;t, by faith, only. We have already &s;hewn they have ju&s;tification by faith, that they are children of God and heirs of the promi&s;es by faith, Gal. 3.26.29. and to them that are in Chri&s;t there is no condemnation, Rom. 8.1. and to them "who are in him," he is made of God wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption," 1 Cor. 1.30. Who are they? Paul tells you, if any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature; old things are pa&s;t away, behold all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5.17. and he further de&s;cribes them, Rom. 8. as "tho&s;e who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit," as "delivered from the law of &s;in and death, as "mind|ing the things of the Spirit," and "&s;piritually minded," and "as lead by the Spirit, as the &s;ons of God," v. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 14. and &s;ays, v. 9. "now if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his." Surely they who have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, cannot be of his body, for Paul &s;ays expre&s;sly, they are none of his (i.e.) are not of is body: and this di&s;tinction between be|lievers, the church of God, as the body of Chri&s;t; as contradi&s;t|ingui&s;hed from the unbelieving and ungodly: and &s;o, between the righteous and wicked, them that are Chri&s;t's and them that are none of his, is as clear, as any doctrine in &s;cripture, and runs

through the revelation of God. Wherefore his doctrine, that all the reprobate &s;ons of belial in earth and hell are united to Chri&s;t, as members of his body; is a mo&s;t gro&s;s and palpable error; and his &s;cheme of doctrine built upon this union, is a mo&s;t manife&s;t delu&s;ion. I would further remark, that the free incorporation of jews and gentiles without di&s;tinction, into the church of Chri&s;t, by their profe&s;&s;ion of faith in him; and the incorporation of all true believers of all nations in him, as their head, life and hope, &s;o as to become members of his body, and members of the great family of God in heaven and earth, is the mi&s;tery the apo&s;tle is treating of, in both the&s;e epi&s;tles. This is emphatically "his reconciling all things in heaven and earth by him&s;elf and to him&s;elf, and reheading them, in him&s;elf." The prophet taught the conver&s;ion of the gentiles in the reign of Me&s;&s;iah, but the free incorporation of all nations upon the &s;ame footing "of faith," &s;o as to become one church and body of Chri&s;t, and members of the illu&s;trious family of God in heaven and earth, was a great &s;ecret in foregoing ages, compared with the clearne&s;s with which it is revealed by the apo&s;tles. Now, believers of all nations "are no more &s;trangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the &s;aints and of the hou&s;hold of God," Eph. 2.19. &s;ee Heb. 12.22, 3, 4. this I take to be "the mi&s;|tery which hath been hid from ages and generations, but now is made manife&s;t to his &s;aints," to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mi&s;tery among the gen|tiles, which is Chri&s;t in you the hope of glory, Col. 1.26, 27. It cannot be their "my&s;tery of the re&s;toration of all the lap&s;ed race" for this mi&s;tery we &s;ee "was manife&s;t to the &s;aints" whereas theirs, by their own conce&s;&s;ion, note p. 253, was unknown to the apo&s;tles, and of cour&s;e, to the &s;aints. It is to be noted, as the &s;pecial de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, in the&s;e di&s;puted texts, to ex|hibit Chri&s;t, as the only reconciler of all things in heaven and earth, that have been, now are, and ever will be reconciled: and the phra&s;eology in them, conveys this in&s;truction, with great plainne&s;s and force: and it is al&s;o his de&s;ign in the&s;e epi&s;tles, to exhibit his all &s;ufficiency for this important work; to induce &s;inners of all nations to believe in him, and to fix and &s;ettle be|lievers in a firm, perpetual hope and tru&s;t in him, and adherence to his divine go&s;pel, &s;ervice and kingdom: to this end, he gives

In the next words, he goes on to &s;ay to the Ephe&s;ians, "in whom al&s;o we have obtained an inheritance," &amp;c. and the &s;ame to the Colo&s;|&s;ians, "and you that were &s;ometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fle&s;h, through death, to pre&s;ent you holy and un|blameable, and unreproveable in his &s;ight," v. 21, 22. Further, the place, the time and means, and ends of it, as de&s;cribed by the apo&s;tle, do all pointedly and &s;trongly &s;hew the whole work to be accompli&s;hed, in this world. The "place" in which this great work is accompli&s;hed, is &s;pecified and fixed in both texts, it is (epi tes ges) "upon earth," in both. From the expre&s;s de&s;cription "things in heaven" and "things on earth," the un|reconciled, finally impenitent, and tho&s;e in hell, are ab&s;olutely excluded, from the things that ever will be ingathered and re|conciled: and the diction, in connexion with his &s;hewing how this work is now effecting, naturally and plainly indicates the whole work will be accompli&s;hed, during this pre&s;ent earth. But this is more &s;trongly fixed, in the phra&s;e, that points out "the time and means" for the perfecting of it. In the &s;econd text it is, "in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times." The plain meaning I take to be this; this work will be accompli&s;h|ed by the means of the di&s;pen&s;ation of his kingdom and grace, and in the fulne&s;s of the times of the admini&s;tration of it, before the grand expected &s;ettlement of it, at the end of the world, when time &s;hall be no longer. There was a glorious ingather|ing of believers in Chri&s;t their head, in that day; and there will
<PB N="203" REF="019737_0222_0FACA7EBE0E40758">
be a gradual ingathering of them in the more ordinary times of this di&s;pen&s;ation: but in the fulne&s;s of the times predicted for the ingathering of the fulne&s;s of the jews, and of all gentile na|tions, in a long and glorious period, will be the greate&s;t harve&s;t of all; and the whole work will be compleated in the fulne&s;s of the times of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of this kingdom, before the final &s;ettlement of it, in the great day. Then cometh the end of his admini&s;tration of this kingdom, and the end of time. And it is a contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e time, when it &s;hall be no lon|ger. Nor do the in&s;pired writers annex (chronon) or any note of time, to any things whatever, after the la&s;t judgment. This author &s;ays, it &s;hould "be particularly regarded here," this time of Chri&s;t's admini&s;tration ought not to be confined, as mo&s;t di|vines do confine it, to this pre&s;ent &s;tate; but it is to be carried into the re&s;urrection world," &amp;c. p. 147, 148. We do note it, but as an error in him, which has no foundation in revelation. He conceeds (in the note afore referred to) that the apo&s;tles did not know his &s;cheme of re&s;toration; and therefore Paul did not, could not carry it into the re&s;urrection world. And we &s;top, where he confined, and de&s;igned that we &s;hould confine it; not daring to be pre&s;umptuou&s;ly wi&s;e above what is written, and manife&s;tly de&s;igned, by the in&s;pired penman. Moreover, the go&s;pel way and means, whereby this divine work will be effec|ted, as particularly pointed out by this apo&s;tle, &s;hew the accom|pli&s;hment of it in this world. Hence, he &s;peaks of every thing relating to the unity of the body of Chri&s;t, the perfecting of this work and the grand means to effect it, as in this world. As in Ephe&s;. 4.4. and onwards; "there is one body, and one &s;pirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; (which cannot mean the uncalled, unbelieving world) "one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and in you all: but to every one of us is given grace according to the mea&s;ure of the gift of Chri&s;t." He is evidently &s;peaking not of all the lap&s;ed race, but of the church as formed into one body and &s;pirit in Chri&s;t, in this world; and as effected by go&s;pel faith and ordinances. For there is no "calling" by the go&s;pel, no profe&s;&s;ion "of faith," no "bapti&s;m" in the future world, whereby the finally impenitent may be brought into the church of God. And he is more particular in his de&s;cription of go&s;pel
<PB N="204" REF="019737_0223_0FACA7ECA1AAE968">
means which belong to Chri&s;t's kingdom in this world, only, in the next ver&s;es. "Wherefore he &s;aith, when he a&s;cended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men," v. 8. and he tells us preci&s;ely what they are in the next ver&s;es before tran&s;cribed, the go&s;pel mini&s;try and admini&s;trations: and it is to be noted, they will continue till the whole work of the body of Chri&s;t be compleated, "till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t." The whole work will then be compleated; the connexion &s;hews, the go&s;pel mini&s;try will continue till this be effected; but, by the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t they will continue only to the end of this world; and it is conceeded by this author: and this confirms the con&s;truction we have given of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times. The mini&s;try, the di&s;pen&s;ation, and the fulne&s;s of times come to a period in the great day, when the whole work will have been compleated. I have one thing more to add, the great ends to be an&s;wered in this all-important work of Chri&s;t, as &s;pe|cified by the apo&s;tle in the&s;e epi&s;tles, clearly confirm the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. It is that the exceeding riches of God's grace might be manife&s;ted in all the &s;aved, by faith in Chri&s;t; and that they might be to the prai&s;e and glory of his grace in this world, in heaven and eternity: as Eph. 2.7, 8. and every where.&mdash; "It is to the intent, that unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church (called, ingathered and &s;anctified by faith in Chri&s;t, and not the re&s;toration of all the lap&s;ed race) the manifold wi&s;dom of God," Eph. 3.10. As to the happy &s;ubjects them&s;elves, who are cordially reconciled to God and ingathered into Chri&s;t their adorable head, it is that they may be "pre&s;ented holy, unblameable and unreproveable in his &s;ight," Col. 1.22.&mdash;In re&s;pect to Chri&s;t the adorable Sa|viour, it is "that he may pre&s;ent it" (this illu&s;trious body of all the reconciled, ingathered, redeemed &amp; &s;aved out of this world) "to him&s;elf a glorious church, without &s;pot and blemi&s;h," as &s;pecified Eph. 5.27. in and by whom he will be eternally ho|noured and glorified. Now we read of but one pre&s;entation of the redeemed and &s;aved of our world, and that is in the great judgment day; "when Chri&s;t &s;hall be glorified in all his &s;aints, and admired in all that believe," 2 The&s;. 1.10. It &s;eems evi|dent,
<PB N="205" REF="019737_0224_0FACA7ED62FB5A50">
this whole work of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be compleated before that day, to an&s;wer all the&s;e grand intentions of it. How could we expect, in the&s;e epi&s;tles, a more full information of the comple|tion of this whole work of Chri&s;t before the final &s;ettlement of his kingdom, in the great day, than is contained in the&s;e col|lected particulars taken all together. The conclu&s;ion we de|duce is, that the&s;e texts taken in connexion with other illu&s;tra|ting pa&s;&s;ages in the&s;e epi&s;tles, produce a full and deci&s;ive witne&s;s not only again&s;t their con&s;truction of them, but al&s;o again&s;t their whole &s;cheme, re&s;pecting the &s;alvation of the finally di&s;obedient.</P>
<P>I &s;hall briefly notice &s;ome things &s;aid upon the&s;e texts, which may further elucidate the &s;ubject. "By heaven and earth," he under&s;tands "the whole lower world, the earth and all men and things in it, and the heavens that environs it." And he &s;ays, the plain meaning of "it has plea&s;ed God to reconcile all things to him&s;elf, things in heaven and things in earth, is "that he has rechanged their &s;tate, brought them back to that they were ori|ginally in," p. 129. This is &s;o far from "obvious" that we &s;ee it fal&s;e in fact, and know it to be both a natural and moral im|po&s;&s;ibility; as any man with a little unbia&s;&s;ed reflection may &s;ee. Be&s;ides, reconciliation is never predicated upon material, inan|imate things, nor the brutal creation. He in&s;i&s;ts much that "reconciliation" intends "all mankind univer&s;ally are put into a &s;alvable condition," p. 133, 139. But this is not reconcilia|tion, as has been &s;hewn: nor can it prove, that all will be &s;aved. For altho' the way of &s;alvation is open to all upon earth through faith in Chri&s;t; yet many live and die unbelievers, and unrecon|ciled enemies to God; and will be condemned and &s;uffer the future puni&s;hment. And to &s;peak of the&s;e unreconciled, con|demned, and executed enemies, as "reconciled," is contradicti|ous non&s;en&s;e. Nor is it true in fact, that all that die in their &s;ins are put into a &s;alvable condition, by the death of Chri&s;t. The tenor of revelation teaches the contrary, as has been proved. And Paul deci&s;ively gives us his own meaning in the text, in the words which immediately follow: "And you that were &s;ometimes alienated, &amp; enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled," Col. 1.21. Paul evidently means by "reconciliation" &s;uch a change of &s;tate whereby tho&s;e who were before enemies "in their minds" become cordial friends
<PB N="206" REF="019737_0225_0FACA7EE20AD5370" MS="y">
to God; &s;uch a change of temper in them, as fits them for the &s;ervice and kingdom of God, and introduces them into a &s;tate of peace with him, through faith in Chri&s;t. And this is invariably his &s;en&s;e upon this &s;ubject, throughout his epi&s;tles. But the&s;e finally condemned, executed enemies he tells us, will be reconciled by other means, in future di&s;pen&s;ations which will prove more effectual," p. 139. It cannot be by faith, nor by the go&s;pel&mdash;it mu&s;t be then by another con&s;titution&mdash;another go&s;pel; and who dare to preach it, when Paul teaches us tho' it were an angel from heaven, let him be accur&s;ed?" Gal. 1.8. But what the&s;e means and di&s;pen&s;ations are&mdash;and how, or when, or where they will be recovered by them, no body knows, not can tell a &s;yllable about them. It is the blind lead the blind in this dark way; and no dei&s;tical, yea athei&s;tical leap was ever more ab&s;olutely in the dark. Could Paul pour &s;uch contempt upon the glorious go&s;pel, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity, annul the energy, and counteract the efficacy of it; as to encourage the rebellious, they may &s;afely neglect the great &s;alvation; for future means and di&s;pen&s;ations yet more effectual that await them, and which en&s;ure, their e&s;cape and recovery? Could he do it in the face of &s;cores of as plain texts, as ever he wrote? It is im|po&s;&s;ible, it is horridly evil. But what I de&s;ign chiefly to re|mark on, is his manner of making out his "mi&s;tery" of the &s;al|vation of all men, from the&s;e texts. He fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;es, all the lap&s;ed race are included in "the things in heaven and upon earth," who are to be reconciled, recovered and reduced to a regular, well &s;ubordinated whole. Whereas, all that have died in their &s;ins, all the di&s;obedient &s;pirits in the infernal pri&s;on; all the con&s;igned to the future puni&s;hment in the great day, are as ab&s;olutely excluded, in the diction of the texts, as the Ma|hometan creed, is. He then improves this, as a key to the after de&s;criptions of this mi&s;tery. Whereas, the&s;e after de&s;crip|tions are de&s;igned illu&s;trations of that, and &s;o are in truth the true key of the con&s;truction of it. The free incorporation of believing jews and gentiles into the church and body of Chri&s;t, is &s;o evident, in &s;everal of the de&s;criptions of this mi&s;tery as can|not be denied: but he adds "the ultimate intention is, the re|duction or re&s;toration of the whole;" whereas, it is clearly ex|cluded the texts, nor is there a &s;ingle illu&s;tration in either epi&s;|tle,
<PB N="207" REF="019737_0226_0FACA7EEE9277A08">
that gives any countenance to it. In mo&s;t of the&s;e illu&s;tra|ting texts, believers are &s;o pointed out, that he can argue with plau&s;ibility, but from one or two of them, where they are yet manife&s;tly intended. His principal text is, Eph. 3.6. "that the Gentiles &s;hould be fellow-heirs, and of the &s;ame body, and partakers of his promi&s;e in Chri&s;t, by the go&s;pel." He con&s;trues it, jews and gentiles, mankind univer&s;ally, were fellow-heirs, &s;o united together as to make one and the &s;ame body, and copar|tners in eternal life, which, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel," p. 158. Believing jews and gentiles, are un|doubtedly intended here, as well as every where el&s;e, as fellow heirs of the promi&s;e in Chri&s;t." Paul could not intend the wicked that die in their &s;ins; for he tells us expre&s;sly "they have no inheritance in the kingdom of God." He could not mean tho&s;e who died in their &s;ins before the go&s;pel, nor tho&s;e who reject the go&s;pel, nor his unreconciled final enemies, whom he expects to be &s;aved by other and more effectual means and di&s;|pen&s;ations than the go&s;pel; for it is expre&s;s in this text, "the&s;e jews and gentiles become fellow heirs, "by the go&s;pel." The&s;e exceptions exclude no &s;mall part of mankind. Again, the i|dolatrous Gentiles mu&s;t be excluded, for Paul mo&s;t expre&s;sly excludes them this fellow-heir&s;hip. In the 2d cha. v. 12. he de&s;cribes them, as "without Chri&s;t, being aliens from the com|monwealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers from the covenants of pro|mi&s;e, having no hope, and without God in the world." He could not in the compa&s;s of &s;ixteen ver&s;es, &s;et up &s;uch a &s;taring contradiction, as to &s;ay, the&s;e excluded aliens, were all fellow-heirs of the go&s;pel promi&s;e of eternal life: nor could he intend the unbelieving jews whom he repre&s;ents in the 9th, 10th and 11th chapters to the Romans, as cut off by unbelief, and will remain cut off from joint heir&s;hip, till graffed in again, by faith. Again, Paul could not &s;o palpably contradict the apo&s;tolic commi&s;&s;ion, as to teach this joint heir&s;hip, of all mankind: for by this commi&s;&s;ion, neither jew nor gentile could have heir|&s;hip and partner&s;hip in the privileges of the kingdom of God in this world, unle&s;s, they believed and were bapti&s;ed: nor be &s;aved but by faith in Chri&s;t. Again, this apo&s;tle teaches us the inheritance is by promi&s;e, that the promi&s;e is to the believing &s;eed, exclu&s;ively: that ju&s;tification, adoption and heir&s;hip to
<PB N="208" REF="019737_0227_0FACA7EFA1FD37B8">
the go&s;pel promi&s;es, are all by faith. He labours the &s;ubject in the four fir&s;t chapters to the Romans, and &s;econd and third to the Galatians. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that in contradiction to all this, he &s;hould here a&s;&s;ert that all the unbelieving of mankind univer&s;ally, are joint partners in the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel, which he every where el&s;e appropriates to believers. Further, that which alone is &s;ufficient to decide it, that he here intends believing jews and gentiles as fellow heirs, is this; that he is treating of this &s;ubject, this mi&s;tery (and not of the re&s;toration of all men) in both the foregoing chapters. We have &s;hewn it in the fir&s;t, and the &s;econd is in the &s;ame &s;train, throughout. It is tho&s;e "once dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, now quickened," v. 1. "quickened together with Chri&s;t and &s;aved by grace," v. 5. "rai&s;ed up together and made to &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us," v. 6. "&s;aved by grace, through faith," not unbelievers, v. 8. who are God's workman&s;hip created in Chri&s;t to good works, v. 10. "who were in time pa&s;&s;ed gentiles" (not chri&s;tians) and "at that time were aliens, &s;trangers to the co|venants of promi&s;e, without God, Chri&s;t, and hope," v. 11, 12. "but now in Chri&s;t Je&s;us (being believing chri&s;tians) are bro't nigh, by the blood of Chri&s;t," v. 13. "for he is our peace," (meaning believing jews and gentiles) "to make in him&s;elf of twain, one new man, &s;o making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cro&s;s," v. 14, 15, 16. and "have both acce&s;s by one &s;pirit unto the Father," as his child|ren, v. 18. "now therefore" (their &s;tate being changed from idolatrous Gentiles into believing Chri&s;tians) "they are no more &s;trangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;hold of God," v. 19. "built upon the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the chief corner-&s;tone," "an habitation of God through the Spirit," v. 20, 22. which &s;urely cannot agree to the infidel world. Now, the apo&s;tle is pur&s;uing the &s;ame &s;ubject, in this third chapter, as, in the fore|going ones, illu&s;trating the mi&s;tery of the incorporation of be|lieving jews and gentiles into one body in Chri&s;t. And un|doubtedly, it is the&s;e that are intended as "fellow-heirs and of the &s;ame body" in this di&s;puted text. Faith and heir&s;hip to the promi&s;es, are connected together in the go&s;pel con&s;titution, and every where in Paul's writings. Therefore to extend the great
<PB N="209" REF="019737_0228_0FACA7F061E060E8">
promi&s;e of the go&s;pel to all the unbelieving, ungodly world, is mo&s;t manife&s;tly to disjoin what God hath joined together, in a matter of highe&s;t importance to the kingdom of God, and to the &s;ouls of men. I might &s;ubjoin to all this, the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a promi&s;e of joint heir&s;hip and fellow&s;hip granted to all &s;aints in heaven and earth, and to all the reprobate &s;ons of wick|edne&s;s in earth and hell, is as irrational and mi&s;chievous, as it is un&s;criptural. Promi&s;es and rewards be&s;towed pur&s;uant to them, are wi&s;ely de&s;igned to be the great &s;upports of government, to inforce &s;ubjection and obedience: but a promi&s;e of that com|plexion could do no good, but is pregnant with infinite mi&s;chiefs. To &s;et up the promi&s;e in oppo&s;ition to, and in &s;ubver&s;ion of the threatnings and &s;tatutes of di&s;heri&s;on, to final enemies, is not to &s;upport, but to de&s;troy government. Such a promi&s;e, could be no in&s;trument of wi&s;e, holy, righteous and good government, but de&s;truction to it. Where is the inducement to faith, repen|tance, to be good chri&s;tians, dutiful to God and man; if the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel makes all the di&s;obedient joint heirs of eternal life, with the &s;aints of God? What is it but de&s;truc|tion to the character of the infinitely perfect being, by exhibit|ing him as having no regard to &s;in and holine&s;s, or to characters formed by the one or the other; nor to the honour of his adora|ble maje&s;ty, authority, law, go&s;pel and government, in his grant of a promi&s;cuous promi&s;e of eternal life to all his rebellious &s;ub|jects, as copartners with the obedient? a tenet as oppo&s;ite to the tenor of Paul's writings, and of all revelation, as any that can be named. The tempter taught man to rebel again&s;t the term of life, appointed to him of God, with this encouragement, "for God doth know that ye &s;hall be as gods." But to carry the doctrine farther, that all men univer&s;ally, who rebel again&s;t the go&s;pel terms of life and mercy in this &s;tate, "are fellow heirs and copartners of eternal life, by the great promi&s;e of the go&s;pel," &s;eems the &s;ummit of infatuation. Another text is, Paul's commi&s;&s;ion, "and to make all men &s;ee, what is "the fellow&s;hip" of the mi&s;tery, which from the beginning of the world, hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t," v. 9th. The rea&s;ons already given evince "the fellow|&s;hip of the mi&s;tery" in this text, means, "the joint heir&s;hip, and fellow&s;hip of believing jews and gentiles in the church of
<PB N="210" REF="019737_0229_0FACA7F120C78290">
God and body of Chri&s;t:" and this is further confirmed by the text immediately following: "to the intent that "now" unto principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known "by the church" the manifold wi&s;dom of God." The church of the&s;e collected believers mu&s;t be here intended, by which, the&s;e principalities, &amp;c. &s;hould now &s;ee, the manifold wi&s;dom of God, for he had &s;poken of none other; and therefore this is certainly the fellow&s;hip of the mi&s;tery in the foregoing ver&s;e. According to this author, "Paul was to make all men, the whole world of men" to &s;ee "their fellow&s;hip," as fellow-heirs, one mi&s;tical body, and partners in common of eternal life, the great thing promi&s;ed, in the go&s;pel, p. 158, 9. But Paul could not in his &s;en&s;e, make all men &s;ee this mi&s;tery, by preach|ing to the gentiles, in his day: he could not make all the mil|lions who died before he was born, nor all the millions then living, to whom he never preached, "to &s;ee it." Why doth he annex the pronoun "their" fellow&s;hip to this all men? it is not in&s;erted in the text, nor within the meaning of the apo&s;tle. He certainly did not intend this mi&s;tery of iniqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y: for in his key text all things in heaven and earth, all in hell are ab&s;olutely excluded.

He &s;ays this joint partner&s;hip of all men, is &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ted in the words, "who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t," and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gues it p. 159, 160. How doth this prove, Chri&s;t will &s;ave all the wicked, and not condemn them to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, as he hath a&s;&s;ured us he will? He argues "if God created all men by Chri&s;t, we may ea&s;ily collect how he comes to be their common Father, Mal. 11.10. and if their Father, how they are his children; and if they are children, how fit and rea&s;ona|ble it is that they &s;hould be fellow-heirs to, and joint partners in, that happy &s;tate which he hath purpo&s;ed &s;hould take place, when he has gathered all things into one, under the agency of that &s;ame Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom he created them all. This ar|gument concludes as &s;trongly for the joint partner&s;hip of the devil and his angels, as for mankind; for they were all created by Chri&s;t, "and without him was not any thing made which is made." To argue, from the foot of creation, to what is wi&s;e and rea&s;onable in the di&s;pen&s;ation and final retribution of an infinitely wi&s;e, righteous and good government; and &s;o, from the relation of creatures as &s;uch, to creatures in rebellion, to in|duce one and the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, appears &s;o extremely loo&s;e as to carry no conviction in it. If the ratio of heir&s;hip, and of joint partner&s;hip in eternal life, in fact, be grounded on the con|&s;tituted relation of creatures, in creation; then wi&s;e, rational, good moral government, a &s;tate of probation, and characters formed in it for retribution, and all regard to them, are ab&s;o|lutely excluded; and no rebellion can po&s;&s;ibly defeat the inde|fea&s;ible inheritance, on this ground. For the natural relation
<PB N="212" REF="019737_0231_0FACA7F2A2AC8A88">
of creatures to their Creator, mu&s;t eternally remain the &s;ame; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their characters as they may, they are creatures &s;till. But the&s;e great excluded doctrines, are &s;o interwoven throughout revela|tion, that we may as well give up the whole, as exclude them. &mdash;Again, this &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;onablene&s;s of joint partner&s;hip, on the ground of creation, excludes the go&s;pel con&s;titution out of view. All regard to the terms of life and death in it, are plainly excluded in &s;uch a joint partner&s;hip. Did Paul, that affectio|nate lover, preacher and defender of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, in|tend in this pa&s;&s;age, &s;o to exclude it out of view, and out of the world? Be&s;ides, this grounded heir&s;hip, &s;uppo&s;es mankind a race of unoffending creatures; whereas, the truth of fact is, the go&s;pel is a di&s;pen&s;ation of &s;overeign grace and mercy to &s;inful man, "to &s;inners, ungodly, and enemies; which cuts of all hope "of heir&s;hip" on the ground of creation: it opens the way of a mo&s;t happy change from enemies, to become the reconciled friends, adopted children and heirs of God. The terms of heir|&s;hip, life and death are fixed in it, and a compliance with them, inforced by the mo&s;t exceeding great and precious promi&s;es, and terrible threatnings, conceivable by us: and with this view, the promi&s;es are all made, not to men as men, but to tho&s;e of a di&s;tingui&s;hing character, formed in this &s;tate. Now, if heir&s;hip be grounded on the natural relation of creatures, this whole &s;cheme of adoption is &s;et a&s;ide; and the grand intention of the promi&s;es, to inforce the requi&s;itions of go&s;pel duty, and that the heirs be partakers of a divine nature, is &s;uper&s;eded and de&s;troy|ed. In fine, Paul is very expre&s;s, in pointing out the go&s;pel method of adoption, of heir&s;hip and joint fellow&s;hip, in eternal life. "For ye are all" (whether jews or gentiles) "the children of God, by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us," Gal. 3.26. Our Lord gave the charter of it, Joh. 1.12. "But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name." And "the many that will be brought to glory" are all "the &s;ons of God" in this world, by regeneration, faith, adoption and divine invitation, as is evident from the&s;e texts compared: John 3.5. Heb. 2.10. Rom. 8.17. and Mat. 5.45 &amp; 48. their mi&s;tery is plainly an anti&s;criptural, deluding fancy.</P>
<P>The next produced text is, 1 Tim. 2.4. "Who will have
<PB N="213" REF="019737_0232_0FACA7F361600588">
all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." Upon which he argues, "if God is &s;incerely willing and de&s;irous that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, they certainly &s;hall be &s;aved." He might as well argue, that all men do and &s;hall come to the knowledge of the truth, and be &s;anctified by it; which is equally the object of the divine will in the text, and Mr. White allows to be nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation: but it is a certain fact, all men do not come to a &s;anctifying knowledge of the truth in this &s;tate; and as certain from the words of Chri&s;t, that the wicked will be excluded his kingdom and the means of it in the future world; and therefore, their &s;alvation cannot be argued from, but is rather di&s;proved, by the declaration in this text. The plain meaning appears to be this, viz. "It is the will and good plea&s;ure of God, that all men without di&s;t|inction be &s;aved, who comply with the terms of the go&s;pel pro|clamation and con&s;titution; and to this end he wills all &s;orts and nations of men to come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may believe, repent and be &s;aved. This con&s;truction &s;eems mo&s;t obvious, and is be&s;t fitted for the good of men in a &s;tate of probation, and to an&s;wer all the wi&s;e, great and good intentions of the divine government de&s;igned in it. This is a doctrine written as in capitals in the face of the go&s;pel procla|mation &amp; con&s;titution: that was the burthen of Paul's preach|ing; that runs through all his epi&s;tles, and he gives it to us more full and expre&s;s in a parallel pa&s;&s;age, Rom. 10.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17. "For the &s;cripture &s;aith, who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hall not be a&s;hamed. For there is no difference between the jew and the greek: for the &s;ame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him. For who&s;oever &s;hall call on the name of the Lord, &s;hall be &s;aved. How then &s;hall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a preacher? and how &s;hall they preach except they be &s;ent."&mdash;"So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God;" and &s;alvation by faith. That Paul intends, it is the will of God that all &s;orts of men without di&s;tinction be &s;aved, in the way of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, &s;eems evident by his adding, "and come to the knowledge of the truth" (i.e.) that they might be &s;anctified by faith in Chri&s;t, and &s;aved in
<PB N="214" REF="019737_0233_0FACA7F421B14A38">
the way of this divine con&s;titution. This clau&s;e has no force, as applied to the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;alvation of the wicked, in the future world: for if they are to be &s;aved in future di&s;pen&s;ations, and by means more effectual than the go&s;pel, (heaven forgive the bla&s;phemy) their coming to the knowledge of the truth under this di&s;pen&s;ation, hath no &s;ort of connexion, with that extra mode of &s;alvation. Paul could not intend it. In a word, the whole context is taken up with chri&s;tian duty in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, with|out the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of future means, di&s;pen&s;ations, or a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to any that peri&s;h. And therefore there is not a &s;hadow of evidence of their doctrine in the text and con|text. To return to this author: he &s;ays, p. 163. "It is ob|jected, the apo&s;tle is here &s;peaking of all ranks and &s;orts of men, and not of all individuals." To remove which he introduces the whole paragraph. "I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, &s;up|plications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all in authority: that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty: for this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour: who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the know|ledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who gave him|&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time." He &s;ays, it is pa&s;t di&s;pute all men individually are here de&s;igned, for two rea&s;ons: 1. "God's willingne&s;s that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, is brought in as an argument to enforce the duty of praying for all men:" "con&s;equently, we mu&s;t under&s;tand, by all men, the &s;ame per&s;ons in the motive, that are intended in the duty." And then a&s;&s;umes, "Now, all men univer&s;ally are the object of the duty here enjoined. It is for all men without exception we are exhorted to pray: and therefore the&s;e all men, he wills to be &s;aved." We deny his a&s;&s;umption and con&s;equence both, we are not to pray for all men without exception in his &s;en&s;e; nor doth the apo&s;tle mean this; but we are limited to men, who are &s;ubjects of mercy, and under a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy. St. John gives us one exception, expre&s;sly, "tho&s;e that &s;in, the &s;in unto death, 1 Joh. 5.16. The prote&s;tant world give us ano|ther, very ju&s;t and great exception, not to pray for the dead. This exception, includes many millions of mankind, who have
<PB N="215" REF="019737_0234_0FACA7F4E1604020">
died from the beginning the world, to this day. We have no duty to this numerous all men, that have been before us, of prayer or any thing el&s;e. Tho&s;e that have died in their &s;ins, cannot be &s;aved in the day of the Lord; for "their re&s;urrection will be to damnation." Which &s;huts the door of prayer and hope. Nor do our opponents pray for the "all men" that pe|ri&s;hed in the flood&mdash;in Sodom and Ghomorrha&mdash;the I&s;raelites that peri&s;hed in the wilderne&s;s&mdash;the old Babylonians and others who peri&s;hed in wrath. Should they publickly pray for the&s;e "all men," it is pre&s;umed, no congregation of judicious chri&s;t|ians would hear them, a &s;econd time. Their own conduct then condemns their con&s;truction, and confutes their conclu&s;ion. Take the illu&s;trating in&s;tance given us in this paragraph; we are certainly to pray for our pre&s;ent, living rulers, only. We are not to pray for all the wicked kings, governors and rulers which have been before us, for cruel Pharoahs, blood-thir&s;ty Herods, Neroes, &amp;c. "that we might live peaceable and godly lives under them:" nor are "we to give thanks" for the&s;e "all men:" no, they were cur&s;es to the world, while they lived&mdash; it was a mercy to mankind when they were taken away; and we have nothing to do with them. So that his a&s;&s;umption and conclu&s;ion both fail him, in his way of arguing. To &s;ettle the term "all men" yet more clearly, it may not be improper to note, we have many other duties to "all men" be&s;ides praying for them; but in no in&s;tance is it to be taken in the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e, they would fix upon it. Thus, we are required, "to pro|vide things hone&s;t in the &s;ight of "all men," and "to live peace|ably with "all men," <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 12.17, 18.</NOTE> "to do good to all men, e&s;pecially to the hou&s;hold of faith;" <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.10.</NOTE> "to let our moderation be known to all men;" <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4.5.</NOTE> "to be patient to all men, and follow that which is good to all men;" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. 5.14.15.</NOTE> "to be gentle to all men;" <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.24.</NOTE> "to &s;hew meekne&s;s to all men;" <NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 3.2.</NOTE> "to follow peace with all men;" <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.14.</NOTE> and "to honour all men." <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.17.</NOTE> "All men" in the&s;e texts, can't po&s;&s;ibly mean all mankind, from the beginning to the end of the world. Such a con&s;truction would be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity, becau&s;e the whole &s;cheme of chri&s;tian duties to all men, in that way, would be naturally impo&s;&s;ible to be performed. The pre|ci&s;e
<PB N="216" REF="019737_0235_0FACA7F5A0A58F28">
meaning is, "all men" without di&s;tinction or exception, with whom we are conver&s;ant. This mu&s;t be our chri&s;tian de|portment towards them, whether they be good or evil, whether jew or greek, chri&s;tian or infidel. Now, in a &s;imilar limited &s;en&s;e, is this duty of prayer; it is for all men living under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy; and for po&s;terity. Nor, will it follow from our duty to pray for all men, that all &s;hall be &s;aved. The p&s;almi&s;t prayed for his enemies; it availed not for them, but returned into his own bo&s;om. But a deci&s;ive argument a|gain&s;t the &s;alvation of all men may be formed on this ground. Thus, our Saviour never prayed for tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, nor for final unbelievers; nor hath taught us to pray for them: therefore they are not the &s;ubjects of mercy, nor objects of prayer and hope; if they were, they would be prayed for; and con&s;equently, they will never be &s;aved. A 2d rea&s;on given, why God de&s;ires the &s;alvation of all men is, becau&s;e "there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us." Now, it is &s;aid, this is a rea&s;on that extends to all men equally, and without exception." Can this be the rea&s;on why God wills the &s;alvation of men, when his will and purpo&s;e to &s;ave men, in nature, preceeds the providing a Modiator? Can the effect be before the cau&s;e, and the ground and rea&s;on of it? God has opened a way of &s;alvation for all &s;orts and na|tions of men, upon the &s;ame terms. All who comply with them, without di&s;tinction, &s;hall be &s;aved. He wills that all &s;orts and nations of men be taught and prayed for, that they may come to the knowledge and obedience of the truth, that they may be &s;aved. The meaning is exceedingly obvious: he &s;ays, the ju&s;t and full &s;en&s;e, may be collected from Rom. 3.29, 30. "Is he a God of the jews, only? Is he not of the gentiles al&s;o? yes, of the gentiles al&s;o; &s;ince it is one God that ju&s;tifieth the circum|ci&s;ion by faith, and the uncircumci&s;ion through faith." He &s;ays, "in like manner we may argue here, Is he the God of a &s;mall portion of mankind only? is he not the God and Father of all men? &s;urely he is; and equally willing to ju&s;tify them all through "the faith of the go&s;pel." What then? the apo&s;tle's &s;tating, and his own arguing, leaves all final unbelievers to pe|ri&s;h, notwith&s;tanding God's willingne&s;s to &s;ave all believers of every nation, without di&s;tinction or exception. It is directly
<PB N="217" REF="019737_0236_0FACA7F6669C4AE8">
again&s;t his de&s;igned conclu&s;ion that unbelievers &s;hould be &s;av|ed al&s;o. His own arguing limits it to "faith in the go&s;pel." How doth this prove they can be &s;aved without f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and with|out the go&s;pel, in future di&s;pen&s;ations of more effectual means? he can't find a &s;ingle text of the apo&s;tles, but will le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their whole &s;cheme of future &s;alvation, ab&s;olutely excluded, ju&s;t as it doth here. The other branch of the rea&s;on is, there is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, "equally extends to all men." That is, he equally mediates for jew and gentile, all &s;orts of men, that who&s;oever believes in him &s;hall be &s;aved. But this notwith&s;tanding, "who&s;oever believeth not &s;hall be damned." He &s;ays tho&s;e words, "who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time," exceedingly favours his interpretation of v. 4th. So far from it, that it ab&s;olutely confutes it, if we make the de&s;ign for which it was provided and given, and the go&s;pel con&s;titution founded on it, the key of con&s;truction to a&s;certain the meaning of it. For it was pro|vided and given of the Father, "that who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life," Joh. 3.16. and Chri&s;t him&s;elf gave the ran&s;om for all, to &s;anctify and purify to him&s;elf, a peculiar people out of all the nations of the earth," as Tit. 2.14. and Rev. 7.9, 10. and by the go&s;pel con&s;titution founded on it. "Faith in Chri&s;t always was, now is, and always will be the only way of life, for &s;inful man." Now, by this key of con&s;truction, it is evident, "God wills the &s;alvation of all men" in the way of this divine con&s;titution, only,&mdash;and "Chri&s;t gave the ran&s;om for all," to purcha&s;e and &s;ecure final &s;alvation to all the believing and &s;anctified of all nations with|out di&s;tinction or exception. But unbelievers will be excluded the final re&s;t of the people of God&mdash;the death of Chri&s;t will profit them nothing, who make it vain&mdash;and to tho&s;e who re|ject this ran&s;om "there remains no more &s;acrifice for &s;in." Nor can the de&s;ire and will of God, and the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t be fru&s;|trated, as is &s;trangely imagined: for, as it is taught in the above texts, and throughout revelation, it will be accompli&s;hed in the &s;alvation of all believers throughout all nations and generations. And the de&s;ign, great glory and efficacy of this ran&s;om, will be illu&s;triou&s;ly atte&s;ted to all &s;orts of men, of all nations, in the in|gathering of the fullne&s;s of the jews &amp; gentiles, to be ingraffed
<PB N="218" REF="019737_0237_0FACA7F7219E1828">
"by faith in him," as taught by Paul, Rom. 11. This author, argues &s;trenuou&s;ly, from God's willing and de&s;iring the &s;alvation of all men, to the certainty of it, p. 166, 7. "Infinite wi&s;dom, excited by infinite benevolence, and accompanied with infinite power, is able to devi&s;e and execute a &s;cheme of &s;alvation for all men, con&s;i&s;tent with their liberty, as moral agents." (But is it po&s;&s;ible for God to lie? to receive tho&s;e into his re&s;t, whom he hath excluded by his oath? to admit tho&s;e to life, and to in|herit his kingdom, whom he hath expre&s;sly declared "&s;hall not &s;ee life," and again and again, "that they &s;hall not inherit his kingdom.") He goes on, if he de&s;ires they &s;hould be &s;aved, it is con&s;tructively the &s;ame thing "as if it had been &s;aid, he would &s;ave them, in event and fact:" for if he is able and de&s;i|rous of it, he will u&s;e the means, that &s;hall be effectual to it. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the argument. To which, I reply.&mdash; God hath revealed his willingne&s;s to &s;ave all men, and hath ex|pre&s;sly revealed the con&s;titution and terms, by which, and by which only, he will &s;ave all men that are &s;aved. The argu|ment then amounts to this: if he wills to &s;ave men by the go&s;|pel con&s;titution, he wills likewi&s;e to &s;ave them without, and again&s;t it. That is, he wills to honour it, and to &s;upport his authority and government, and illu&s;trate his moral perfections in highe&s;t glory, in exalting believers to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, by it: and yet he wills to di&s;honour it, to &s;et it a&s;ide, and &s;a|crifice the infinitely important intentions to be an&s;wered by it; by &s;aving all final unbelievers in &s;ome other way, which nece&s;|&s;arily &s;ubverts it. The ab&s;urdity of which is obvious, at fir&s;t &s;ight. Is there any force in arguing, becau&s;e he will &s;ave men in his appointed way, therefore he will &s;ave them out of it? the &s;uppo&s;ition is great pre&s;umption, and reflects great di&s;honor upon the wi&s;dom, government, truth and immutability of God. To this pre&s;umption, the devil by an abu&s;e of &s;cripture tempted our Saviour to ca&s;t him&s;elf down from the pinnacle of the tem|ple, if he was the Son of God: "for it is written, he &s;hall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they &s;hall bear thee up, lea&s;t at any time thou da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a &s;tone," Mat. 4.6. The &s;nare lay in this, he left out "in all thy ways," which is expre&s;sly in&s;erted in the text quoted, P&s;al. 91.11. Which was de&s;igned to guard again&s;t all pre&s;umption of &s;ecu|rity
<PB N="219" REF="019737_0238_0FACA7F7E136D690">
and &s;alvation, out of God's way. Had he inforced the temptation with "infinite wi&s;dom excited by infinite benevo|lence, and accompanied with infinite power, is able to contrive and execute a &s;cheme to &s;ave him, as well out, as in the ap|pointed way; it would have availed nothing: he knew it hor|rid pre&s;umption; and repels it with, "it is written, thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God," v. 7. A clear in&s;truction, that &s;ecurity and &s;alvation may not be expected out of God's ap|pointed way; whatever may be urged, from the perfections, or word of God, to infer it. And the u&s;e of go&s;pel appointed means, in order to obtain &s;alvation, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the Dr. is full and expre&s;s, "nor is there ground of hope, in the revelations of God to be &s;aved, any other way," Sea&s;.

<P>Thus much, he thinks, the obvious import of tho&s;e texts, which &s;peak of "the de&s;truction of &s;in," "taking way the &s;ins of men," "and &s;aving them from their &s;ins, as the great de&s;ign of the mediatorial mi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t in the world," p. 171. It is true the&s;e texts teach us, how Chri&s;t will execute his work of &s;aving men, even all men in this world, that will be finally &s;av|ed, viz. by "&s;aving them from their &s;ins." But in his &s;econd coming, he will come to de&s;troy &s;in and the workers of iniquity another way, which will not infer their &s;alvation, but de&s;truction. He cites 1 Joh. 3.8. "For this purpo&s;e, was the Son of God manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil," "that is, vice and wickedne&s;s." As Chri&s;t was manife&s;t to &s;ave men in this way, &s;o it is certain he will in fact, de&s;troy the power of
<PB N="220" REF="019737_0239_0FACA7F8A17C4400">
&s;in and wickedne&s;s in all whom he &s;aves; con&s;equently all who go on impenitently in the &s;ervice of &s;in and &s;atan, cannot be &s;a|ved. And v. 4. "who was manife&s;ted to take away our &s;ins; the &s;ins of all who believe in him; and he certainly will do it." Joh. 1.29. "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;ins of the world." He &s;o takes away the &s;in of the world, that all men without di&s;tinction or exception, who believe in him, &s;hall have the power and guilt of their &s;ins taken away. The name Je&s;us is given to him, Mat. 1. 21. "becau&s;e he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins." Con&s;equently, his enemies who will not have him to rule over them, are not his people, and will not be &s;aved by him: for all his willing people whom he &s;aves with eternal &s;alvation, he &s;aves from their &s;ins in this world, an&s;wer|able to the grand intention of his office as a Saviour, and of his mi&s;&s;ion into the world. The&s;e texts, taken in their true &s;en&s;e and connexion, in the go&s;pel con&s;titution, are &s;o far from teach|ing the &s;alvation of all men, that they &s;trongly infer the con|trary. Neither is there a &s;hadow of evidence in them, that it was the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's manife&s;tation, to de&s;troy &s;in univer|&s;ally in all men; but only, in them who become his willing people, and are &s;aved in this in&s;tituted way: as is illu&s;trated in truth and fact, throughout his di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t main proof of his propo&s;ition is, P&s;al. 8.5, 6. as explained and argued from Heb. 11.6&mdash;9. "Thou made&s;t him a little lower than the angels; thou crowned&s;t him with glory and honour, and did&s;t &s;et him over the work of thy hands: thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet." The&s;e words he &s;ays are applied, "tending to prove the &s;uperiority of Chri&s;t over the angels." (But this is a wrong key to con&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age by, &s;o as to comport with the principal de&s;ign of it.) For having &s;aid, v. 5th, "unto the angels hath he not put in &s;ubjection the world to come:" he then introduces this pa&s;&s;age, and having mentioned tho&s;e words "thou ha&s;t put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet," he goes on and argues as 8th and 9th ver&s;es, "for in that he put all in &s;ubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we &s;ee not yet all things put under him: but we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;uffering of death, crowned with glory and "honour, that he by the grace of
<PB N="221" REF="019737_0240_0FACA7F961B80CB0">
God &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." He &s;ays, the word "all things" mu&s;t be taken in the greate&s;t latitude, (God only excepted) and argues, "if nothing be left un&s;ubjected by him, then the time mu&s;t come when &s;in will be &s;ubjec|ted to him. Now &s;in can be &s;ubjected in no way, he tells us, but by effecting &s;uch a change in &s;inners as to make them Chri&s;t's willing and obedient people," p. 179. But this is &s;aid without proof, that it may not be &s;ubjected another way, in the &s;en&s;e of this text. He further argues, "if all things with|out exception &s;hall be &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t; then the time mu&s;t come, when there &s;hall be no rebels among the &s;ons of Adam, no enemies again&s;t the moral government of God." And he might as well have applied it to the devil and his angels, for they are all &s;ubjected to Chri&s;t, as well as final enemies of man|kind, and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. "For, he &s;ays, there is no way of reducing rebels, &s;o as to de&s;troy their character as &s;uch, but by making them willing &s;ubjects," p. 183. But where doth he find that the character of final enemies will ever be de&s;troyed? the text &s;ays nothing of it, nor is there a hint of it, in all reve|lation. Why may not rebels again&s;t God be reduced, in the way of governmental judicial &s;ubjection, without their charac|ters being de&s;troyed? It is a known fact all over the world, that rebels and enemies are reduced and &s;ubjected to the con|troul and honour of authority, law and government, among men, when cut off by the hand of public ju&s;tice. And in many retributive providences, God hath thus reduced and &s;ubjected them, by his more immediate hand. He concludes, if any &s;u&s;pect he lays too great &s;tre&s;s upon the word "all things," he tru&s;ts they will acquit him and lay the blame upon the apo&s;tle, "for he is &s;ure, the argument concludes thus much, if it con|cludes any thing at all." I mo&s;t heartily acquit the apo&s;tle, for I cannot perceive he has given any occa&s;ion or countenance to &s;uch extravagant rea&s;oning. And if we can rectify his mi&s;taken key, and wrong &s;en&s;e of the word "&s;ubjection" perhaps every one will &s;ee where the blame ought to lay. The true key is found in the foregoing ver&s;es of a context: "Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t heed to the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let them &s;lip. For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;|obedience
<PB N="222" REF="019737_0241_0FACA7FA21B9ED28">
received a ju&s;t recompence of reward; how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect to great &s;alvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s, both with &s;igns and wonders, and with diver&s;e miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, according to his own will," v. 1, 2, 3, 4. then he intro|duces the paragraph in di&s;pute, in an argumentative way and connexion, to inforce the foregoing admonition and warning "of the impo&s;&s;ibility of an e&s;cape, to the neglectors of this great &s;alvation." "For unto the angels he hath not put in &s;ubjection the world to come, whereof we &s;peak;" v. 5. for if it was &s;o, men might imagine an e&s;cape po&s;&s;ible; but all po&s;&s;ibility of it is excluded&mdash;for the world to come, as well as this world and all things in them, are put in &s;ubjection, into the ab&s;olute di&s;|po&s;al the adorable Je&s;us, in the throne of God; to this very end, that all things &s;hould now be regulated and governed by him, and all moral created beings in both worlds &s;hould be &s;ub|jected by his righteous &s;entence in a &s;tate of final retribution, for eternity: and the &s;entence to the righteous and wicked of mankind will be according to the con&s;titution of this go&s;pel, &s;o gloriou&s;ly introduced, and atte&s;ted by God. How then an final neglectors of this &s;alvation e&s;cape? this univer&s;al &s;ubjec|tion, we are taught by prophetic in&s;piration in the text cited. Neither is it any objection, or encouragement to the di&s;obedi|ent, that we do not now &s;ee all things &s;o &s;ubjected to him and by him; &s;ince we &s;ee that which is a certain proof of it. For we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;uffering of death, now in his &s;tate of exaltation "crowned with glory and honour" inve&s;ted with the unlimited power of domi|nion and judgment over both worlds; to &s;ave his people, &s;ub|due his enemies, and regulate and ripen all things for the final &s;ettlement of the kingdom of God and all its concerns according to this go&s;pel. And he is now executing the office of a Saviour, &s;anctifying and &s;aving his people from their &s;ins, bringing many even all that are the &s;ons of God in this world, to glory, as v. 10th. And when he hath compleated this glorious work, he will execute the office of judge, and put down all enemies under his feet by &s;entence and execution: whence it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble, the neglectors of &s;o great &s;alvation can e&s;cape. This I
<PB N="223" REF="019737_0242_0FACA7FAE1CFE240">
conceive to be the thing intended, by the apo&s;tle. The word here u&s;ed to "&s;ubject," is the &s;ame the apo&s;tle u&s;es, Rom. 8.20. where this author &s;ays, a &s;ubjection, by judicial &s;entence, is in|tended. Here, in this pa&s;&s;age, as it refers to final enemies, it mu&s;t undoubtedly intend a governmental, judicial &s;ubjection by &s;entence and execution. For as the connexion &s;hews us, it is de&s;igned, to inforce the warning that impenitent neglectors cannot e&s;cape, it cannot have any force to his purpo&s;e, in any other &s;en&s;e: and it mu&s;t certainly be taken in that &s;en&s;e, which will comport with his de&s;ign, and not in that which will not. His argumentation is clear and &s;trong, in our con&s;truction. If the word, of the con&s;titution introduced by angels was &s;o &s;ted|fa&s;t, that the di&s;obedient could not e&s;cape&mdash;&s;urely, the finally di&s;obedient to the go&s;pel con&s;titution cannot e&s;cape&mdash;ina&s;much as it was &s;o much more gloriou&s;ly introduced by the Lord him|&s;elf, and &s;o extraordinarily atte&s;ted by God: and e&s;pecially, &s;ince the &s;ame Lord who introduced it, and who&s;e honour is in|finitely concerned in the &s;upport of it, is now crowned with glory and honour, with unlimited power of dominion and judg|ment, for this grand purpo&s;e of &s;ubjecting the whole moral creation in a righteous &s;tate of final retribution, for eternity, in the world to come: and he will certainly adjudge the righte|ous to everla&s;ting life, and the wicked to everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment, according to the word and con&s;titution of this go&s;pel. No arrangement of argument can conclude and confirm the impo&s;&s;ibility of their e&s;cape, with &s;tronger force; and no argu|ment more alarming, to inforce the admonition and warning. Let us now &s;ee the force of this other con&s;truction. To the a|larming que&s;tion, how &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation? The an&s;wer it &s;eems, is very ea&s;y&mdash;the time mu&s;t come, when &s;in will be &s;ubjected, when the &s;econd death &s;hall be de&s;troyed, and when their characters as rebels &s;hall be de|&s;troyed, by their becoming a willing and obedient people, and then they &s;hall all univer&s;ally e&s;cape. And the argument of the apo&s;tle proves all this, if it proves any thing at all. This con|&s;truction, is a direct &s;ubver&s;ion of the apo&s;tle's de&s;ign: it ab|&s;olutely de&s;troys his argument, as addre&s;&s;ed to inforce the fore|going admonition and warning, which it renders illu&s;ive and vain: and it renders the argumentation, in its connexion with
<PB N="224" REF="019737_0243_0FACA7FBA0819050">
the foregoing ver&s;es, palpably ab&s;urd, by &s;uch a total de&s;truc|tion of the intention, for which it is introduced. The chief thing in &s;upport of it is this, he &s;ays, "in truth this is the only &s;ubjection, it can rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould be advanced to regal dignity and power, at God's right hand in heaven, that he might accompli&s;h. Sinful men were ab&s;olutely before in &s;ubjection to the kingdom of God's power, as being unable to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance to any of its di&s;plays, however fatal they might be in their tendency. There was no need therefore of Chri&s;t's exaltation in order to force &s;inful men to &s;uch a &s;ub|jection as this," p. 181, 2. In reply, I would &s;ay, the truth is, that God's moral kingdom and government of the moral world, is very different from that of power, exerci&s;ed over the material and unintelligent part of the creation. This moral kingdom is admini&s;tred by way of wi&s;e, righteous con&s;titution, laws and in&s;titutions, and followed with final retribution. The obedi|ence of the &s;ubjects of it, is inforced by &s;uitable rewards and puni&s;hments: and the&s;e to be rendered to all according to cha|racter and de&s;erts, in the appointed time of the &s;ettlement of this kingdom, for eternity. Now, the admini&s;tration of this kingdom, of all the concerns, and over all the &s;ubjects of it, in this world and world to come, is put into the hands of Chri&s;t: all things in this kingdom are put in &s;ubjection under his feet, by an authoritative appointment; to regulate, govern and fi|nally &s;ettle it, and the &s;tates of all its &s;ubjects according to cha|racter and de&s;ert; when &s;in and &s;inners will be de&s;ervedly pun|i&s;hed; obedience and the obedient will be rewarded according to promi&s;e; all the friends of God will be exalted to everla&s;ting honour and happine&s;s; but all his enemies will be put down, "&s;ubjected," in eternal di&s;grace and mi&s;ery: then will all things in truth and fact, in this governmental, retributive manner, be put in &s;ubjection to him, in the genuine &s;en&s;e intended, in this di&s;puted pa&s;&s;age. And how &s;hall Chri&s;t execute this infinitely important tru&s;t, in &s;uch an arrangement and regulation of all things, in his pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, and in the final &s;ettlement of this kingdom, as to illu&s;trate all the excellencies, and an&s;wer all the intentions of an infinitely perfect government; but in a &s;tate of exaltation at the right hand of God, inve&s;ted with un|limited power of dominion and judgment? The &s;imple &s;tating
<PB N="225" REF="019737_0244_0FACA7FC608AEEC0">
of the genuine &s;cripture doctrine in the outlines of it, is &s;uffici|ent to clear the &s;ub;ect of the objection, and &s;uch kind of em|bara&s;&s;ing rea&s;onings. His next text is Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11th ver&s;es, "Wherefore, God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. "He argues here as from the foregoing text, for a pious &s;ubjection, bowing and confe&s;&s;ion, in all. He &s;ays, that this exaltation is, the reward of Chri&s;t's humiliation and death&mdash;and it is to univer&s;al dominion. Granted. And "it is that he might reduce all things univer&s;ally under &s;ub|jection; to the moral kingdom of God, which is now under his admini&s;tration." This he judges the text teacheth. We can|not admit it in his &s;en&s;e, but as we have before explained it, and obviated his con&s;truction, that little needs to be here added. The truth is, he is exalted to &s;upreme, unlimited dominion, to govern all things in infinite wi&s;dom; goodne&s;s and rectitude, during the probation of his moral &s;ubjects; to reduce to him|&s;elf and &s;ave a willing people, in completion of the de&s;ign of his death; to controul the de&s;igns of all his enemies; to &s;ub|&s;erve the all-important de&s;igns of an infinitely perfect govern|ment; and finally to &s;ettle it in governmental order, in highe&s;t perfection and glory, in a &s;tate of final retribution to all his &s;ubjects, according to their characters formed in this &s;tate of trial: then all the pious will bow the knee, in pious, thankful acknowledgements; and then all his enemies will be con&s;train|ed to bow to his authority, and by the force of an ire&s;i&s;tible conviction to confe&s;s it is rightful, and his &s;entence is righteous, to the honour of Chri&s;t the Judge; and to the to glory of the Fa|ther that appointed him. This con&s;truction only naturally and forcibly introduces, the practical in&s;truction and admoni|tion which immediately follows&mdash; "Wherefore work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling," v. 12th. He objects, "there is no moral worth in &s;uch a forced &s;ubjection," p. 190. The apo&s;tle &s;ays nothing of it, in that view. It will illu&s;trate the glory of the divine moral character and government, and be an everla&s;ting &s;upport of the divine authority; to the glory of
<PB N="226" REF="019737_0245_0FACA7FD25D6B8C8">
Chri&s;t and the Father: the end is an&s;wered. He argues, "&s;o far as Chri&s;t is now in the execution of this power, it is the truth of fact, he is endeavouring to reduce mankind under o|bedience, as faithful &s;ubject in the kingdom of God." This is a partial &s;tating of the fact. It is true he is executing a glorious work of &s;aving mercy to &s;inful men in this world: in the completion of which an innumerable multitude out of all nations will be &s;aved from the &s;ervitude of &s;in and &s;atan, be made his willing people, and will be eternally happy in and with the Lord. But this is not his whole work and de&s;ign: he is now, in this world executing a work of vengeance upon his irreconcilable enemies: as is exemplified in the unparallel'd de&s;truction executed upon the infidel jews: and al&s;o in his pour|ing out the viols of his wrath upon his wicked enemies in the &s;everal ages of the world, as &s;et forth in the revelations of St. John. In both ways, he is now illu&s;trating the wi&s;dom, power, mercy and righteou&s;ne&s;s of the divine government, which will be perfectly di&s;played in the great day of retribution. But his chief argument is this, that this forced &s;ubjection and con|fe&s;&s;ion is not to be compared with that of the pious: and that this reward be&s;towed upon Chri&s;t will be great or &s;mall accor|ding to the &s;en&s;e in which we under&s;tand this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. If the whole race be reduced in a future mate, more glory will re|dound to Chri&s;t and to the Father, and more good to men; and therefore his, is the mo&s;t rational and glorious &s;cheme. This is the purport of his rea&s;oning upon this text and el&s;ewhere. To which I would reply: It is certain "tho' I&s;rael be not gathered, Chri&s;t will be glorious in the eyes of the Lord," and in the eyes of angels, and will be eternally admired in all that believe.&mdash; The &s;cripture no where repre&s;ents, the whole race of men as to be recovered and given to Chri&s;t as his reward; but the con|trary is held forth in many texts. "He gave his life a ran&s;om for many," "and he &s;hall ju&s;tify many,"&mdash;" bring many &s;ons of God to glory." 'Tis not the whole world, but them that are given him out of the world "that are given of the Father, and all come to him," "believe in him," "that are called, according to his purpo&s;e&mdash;called, ju&s;tified here and glorified hereafter;" and he is "the author of eternal &s;alvation to all who obey him, and "will be admired and glorified in all who believe." This
<PB N="227" REF="019737_0246_0FACA7FDE1453E10">
is the con&s;tant doctrine of revelation. It is true, the greater the number that is &s;anctified and &s;aved out of this world, the great|er will be that part of Chri&s;t's reward. But this rea&s;oning can apply only to the recovered by his grace under the pre&s;ent di&s;|pen&s;ation of his kingdom: and it may well be a &s;timulus to the mo&s;t wi&s;e, wining, vigorous exertions to pluck &s;inners as brands out of the burning; and in exciting them to faith, repentance, and go&s;pel holine&s;s, that they may be the &s;anctified "jewels" of the Lord, "and a diadem" of glory in the hand of our God. But the &s;cheme of the future re&s;toration of the impenitent, hath no good in it to mankind; it tends only to blind and harden men to ruin, under a deluding expectation of more effectual means: and is full of di&s;honour to the Father and Son, as hath already, and will be further &s;hewn. At be&s;t, this is but a par|tial &s;tating of the glorious reward of Chri&s;t's exaltation. The innumerable miriads of the redeemed by his blood, and &s;aved by his power and grace, again&s;t the power of all enemies inter|nal and external, of earth and hell, in whom he will be glorified in the great day, will be an eminent part of his glorious reward. But it is not the whole. The glorious power and exerci&s;e of his pre&s;ent &s;upreme dominion, di&s;playing his unbounded perfecti|ons, in the allwi&s;e government of all things&mdash;the adorations, &s;ubjection and ready obedience of all angels, principalities and powers to him, as his mini&s;tring &s;pirits, together with the high honour of regulating and &s;ettling all the infinite concernments of God's kingdom, in highe&s;t perfection and glory for eternity in the great day, are eminent parts of the reward of his humi|liation and death: nor, is it in the power of all his enemies to exclude him his full reward; for they are all put into his hand and power: and it is his prerogative glory and an eminent part of his reward, to controul and defeat all their de&s;igns, and put them all in a governmental judicial &s;ubjection, under his feet. This final &s;ubjection of all enemies to him and by him, as righ|teous Governour and Judge of the world, is as truly his reward as the &s;alvation of his people: as &s;uch it is repeatedly predicted and promi&s;ed to him P&s;alm 8th &amp; 110th, in the la&s;t paragraph we have con&s;idered, in the pre&s;ent text, in 1 Cor. 15th chap|ters, and many others. Now, while they argue for their future willing &s;ubjection, they are arguing again&s;t this predicted and
<PB N="228" REF="019737_0247_0FACA7FEA1548FF0">
promi&s;ed reward of Chri&s;t, in their &s;ubdual in a judicial &s;ubject|ion: for there is but one promi&s;ed &s;ubjection of final enemies; and if it be willing, it cannot be judicial: but we are a&s;&s;ured it will be judicial, and will be effected in the la&s;t judgment: and it is the la&s;t grand act of his regal and judicial power, to put down all enemies in a judicial &s;ubjection to the law, authority, government and ju&s;tice of the mo&s;t high God; and the la&s;t re|gulation to be made before he gives up the kingdom, as may yet more fully appear. And when Chri&s;t shall have compleated this mo&s;t important work of the final regulation and arrange|ment of all thingsin the kingdom of God in perfection, for eter|nity: that is, when vice and wickedness &s;hall be &s;ubdued and put down by him, in eternal di&s;grace, in the puni&s;hment inflic|ted upon the workers of iniquity; and piety and holine&s;s &s;hall &s;hine in its true excellence and importance, with eternal lu&s;tre, in the rewards be&s;towed on the rigteous: when all the friends of God &s;hall be exalted in the highe&s;t honour and happine&s;s; and all his ungrateful enemies be &s;ubdued and put down in e|ternal infamy; by a power indeed mo&s;t glorious and irre&s;i&s;tible be their numbers as they may: and not only fo, but in &s;uch a righteous retribution according to character, in which his ado|rable wi&s;dom, truth, goodne&s;s and righteo&s;ne&s;s, and that of the divine government, &s;hall &s;hine forth with a clearne&s;s and &s;trength as the &s;un in its meridian lu&s;tre; &s;o that all the con|demned by the force of irre&s;i&s;tible conviction, &s;hall confe&s;s his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and him Lord of all, to the glory of the Father. Then, &s;hall we &s;ee, &s;omething of the greatness, glory and im|men&s;ity of his reward&mdash;than which, taken in this comprehen|&s;ve view of it, I am per&s;uaded, neither men nor angels can con|ceive a greater po&s;&s;ible to be given him of the Father, in con|nexion with the wi&s;e arrangements of his eternal kingdom. All reproaches will be &s;ilenced , nor will there be an athei&s;t, dei&s;t, arian, or focinian in the univer&s;e. His adorable appearance will &s;trike their fa&s;fe creed out of exi&s;tence: for he will appear in the full glory of his true character, "The great God our Saviour," Tit. 2. 13. and "every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s to Chri&s;t, to God that fits in the throne of' judgment, and hath &s;worn to bring it to pa&s;s, "Rom. 14. 1O, 11z. compared with I&s;a. 45.23. and Rev. 20.12.

be no difficulty of admitting this &s;cheme of the next &s;tate, a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, and of the recovery of the finally di&s;obedient in it, which, it is &s;aid, carries in it more good to mankind, and more honour to Chri&s;t and to the Father; were it not for the previou&s;ly imbibed notion of the pre&s;ent &s;tate only being inten|ded for the recovery of men, and tho&s;e who are not recovered now, mu&s;t be mi&s;erable in the next &s;tate, a &s;tate of endle&s;s tor|ment, p. 191, 194. On which I would ob&s;erve, God hath al|ready formed and revealed the infinitely wi&s;e plan of his divine government, and it belongeth not to &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals of ye&s;terday, to form and obtrude another upon mankind, in lieu of that. How came this previou&s;ly imbibed doctrine, to be received by the jewi&s;h and fir&s;t chri&s;tian church and their in|&s;pired teachers, but by in&s;piration from God? this is difficulty enough, to exclude his, and &s;ufficient rea&s;on for us, to receive this doctrine, &s;o taught of God. His &s;cheme is incon&s;i&s;tent with the plan of divine government, taught in &s;cripture. It is excluded by the terms of &s;alvation, the promi&s;es, the threat|nings and every part of the go&s;pel con&s;titution: and it is ex|cluded by the doctrine of retribution, and of the la&s;t judgment every where taught, in revelation. Moreover, his &s;cheme is ab&s;urd to the rea&s;on of man, as well as abhorrent to the revela|tion of God. Two in&s;tances out of many, may &s;erve as a &s;pe|cimen of it: one is, "that the future judgment is not final&mdash; that Chri&s;t will not unalterably fix the &s;tates of good men or bad in it, but will have a great deal to do after it, to reduce all the condemned rebels of that day to a willing &s;ubjection to the di|vine government," p. 208. Is it honourable to the infinitely wi&s;e Governor and Judge of the world, to repre&s;ent him as ma|king &s;uch an imperfect &s;ettlement of his kingdom, as to need another &s;ettlement, as much as ever; &s;o that he mu&s;t go on di&s;ciplining the rebellious out-ca&s;ts for ages of ages, before he can compleat the &s;ettlement of it for eternity? to me, it reflects great di&s;honour. The other in&s;tance, which hath a clo&s;e con|nexion with it, is, that Chri&s;t will never in fact, make a perfect &s;ettlement of his kingdom; nor give it up, nor put the &s;aints in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their eternal inheritance, nor God be all in all, 'till all the abandoned rebels of mankind are recovered to ho|line&s;s and happine&s;s: &s;o that their good di&s;po&s;ition and re&s;tored

vertue is in fact, "the grand &s;u&s;pending condition" on which the whole of the&s;e great events re&s;ts; and without which, the whole mu&s;t be eternally defeated. So he tells us, "when all things &s;hall, in event, or fact, be reduced under &s;ubjection to him, (meaning the &s;ubjection above &s;tated) then, and not till then, however long a &s;pace of time it may require for its ac|compli&s;hment; then &s;hall the Son be &s;ubject, that God may be all in all," p. 200. Now, the &s;cripture teaches, all Chri&s;t's works are perfect; that he fini&s;hed the work of his fir&s;t coming, upon the cro&s;s; that he will fini&s;h the work of his exaltation in his &s;econd coming to judgment; and will then make the final &s;ettlement of his kingdom; put his &s;aints in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their eternal inheritance in the kingdom of their Father; and in the la&s;t great act of his regal and judicial power, will put down all enemies by &s;entence and execution&mdash;then give up the king|dom, and God be all in all. The &s;aints of God in the various ages of the world, have lived and died in expectation of the&s;e great events, to take place in that day; which are infinitely the mo&s;t important, that can take place in the univer&s;e. But ac|cording to the tenet we oppo&s;e, all expectation of it, in heaven and earth, will be fatally di&s;appointed. Neither God, nor Chri&s;t, nor angels or men, &s;hall &s;ee any of the&s;e things true in event, in that all-important day. Is it honourable to Chri&s;t, to be prevented the final &s;ettlement of his kingdom? to &s;upreme Jehovah, to be kept out of the final admini&s;tration of his king|dom? to the &s;aints, to be kept out of their promi&s;ed heavenly inheritance, in that day, and for ages of ages afterwards, all for the &s;ake of wicked enemies? What overwhelming di&s;appoint|ment to the &s;aints of God, if they fail of the heavenly inheritance in that day? But, &s;till more alarming, the before unknown danger, if their final po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion depends upon the forlorn hope, of the recovered vertue, of all the abandoned part of the crea|tion? This inheritance of the &s;aints, is, certainly connected with their faith, piety, enduring to the end, faithful to death, and with the purcha&s;e and promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, the promi&s;es, oath, truth and immutability of God, and the day appointed to re|ceive it. Now is it wi&s;e, &s;afe, honourable to have the inheri|tance taken off and removed from this ground, and put upon an e&s;&s;entially different i&s;&s;ue, viz. the recovery of all the wicked

part of the creation, whether they &s;hall ever, and at what time they &s;hall enjoy it? when at the &s;ame time, their future reco|very is in nature, an infinite improbability; and as the ca&s;e is circum&s;tanced, a moral impo&s;&s;ibility? Be&s;ides, we are repeat|edly admoni&s;hed, to cea&s;e from man, not to put our tru&s;t in man, and it is written "cur&s;ed is the man that tru&s;teth in man, and maketh fle&s;h his arm." After all this, is this way of the cur&s;e, the way to the heavenly inheritance? Is it credible and honourable to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the hopes of all the &s;aints, &s;hould in fact be &s;u&s;pended; and made to depend upon the courte&s;y, good di&s;po&s;ition, and recovered vertue of all their faithle&s;s in|veterate enemies, for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly inheri|tance? Is this for the honour of God, of Chri&s;t, or for the good of mankind? Is this the way, for all iniquity to &s;top her mouth? for &s;aints to be built up in faith, holine&s;s, and comfort to the kingdom of God? Is this, to encourage piety, vertue and all goodne&s;s, which is the true, great intere&s;t, glory and happine&s;s of mankind? In another view, can any thing be more degra|ding to the character of the infinitely wi&s;e God, than to &s;up|po&s;e he "who puts no tru&s;t in his &s;aints," &s;hould put &s;uch an unbounded tru&s;t in the greate&s;t knaves, in all the mo&s;t faithle&s;s, fini&s;hed villains of earth and hell, as to make the inheritance of his &s;aints, the fulfilment of his promi&s;es to Chri&s;t and to them, and all the concerns of his eternal kingdom, ultimately to re&s;t and depend on the will, power, good di&s;po&s;ition and recovered vertue of all the&s;e mi&s;creants? all to depend upon their reco|vered vertue; When? why, after their characters have been expo&s;ed and ruined, in the great day: and after they have been hardening in puni&s;hment, a thou&s;and years, and for ages of ages afterwards. And how? without go&s;pel, without the grace of the &s;pirit, or a &s;ingle privilege of the kingdom of Chri&s;t; without any means of recovery, but darkne&s;s and torment: for all beyond this, is the chimera of imagination only, and hath not a &s;ingle dictate of rea&s;on or revelation, to &s;upport it. What a &s;cheme of ab&s;urdity, di&s;honour and horror is this! In a word, what can be more di&s;honourable and pernicious, than on the one hand, to exhibit the eternal concerns of the Creator, the Redeemer, and of all the &s;aints of God, as depending upon the vile&s;t of &s;inners and enemies, and upon their recovered vertue?
<PB N="232" REF="019737_0251_0FACA801A288AED8">
and on the other hand, to magnify the wicked, abandoned part of the creation into &s;uch a va&s;t importance and power, of doing great and eternal mi&s;chief; as may on this plan be effected, only by their ob&s;tinate wickedne&s;s? for if all depends on their reco|vered vertue and &s;ubjection; &s;o that then, and not till then, the&s;e &s;cenes of eternal importance &s;hall all take place: it &s;eems clearly to follow, that only by their ob&s;tinate wickedne&s;s they may ruin this moral creation, defeat the &s;aints of their eternal inheritance, and overthrow the eternal de&s;igns of the kingdom of Jehovah. Can a po&s;&s;ibility of this be admitted? it &s;urely cannot, any more than athei&s;m it&s;elf. The &s;cheme then is rot|ten in the foundation, and I know none to exceed it, in ab&s;ur|dity, mi&s;chief and di&s;honour. How vain and ab&s;urd the pre|tence, that this is a &s;cheme of greater good and honour, and adapted to convert dei&s;ts?&mdash;The next text produced, is I&s;a. 45.23, to the end; "Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none el&s;e." "I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that unto me every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear," &amp;c. This pa&s;&s;age we have before con&s;idered; and ob&s;erved, as it belongs to the con&s;titution of Chri&s;t's kingdom in this world, it will certainly have its accompli&s;hment, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of it, or at the fi|nal &s;ettlement of it. And we have &s;hewn it will have a literal fulfilment, in the conver&s;ion of the jews and gentiles; and its final completion in the day of judgment: and it cannot go be|yond it. But this author &s;ays, tho' it will have an accompli&s;h|ment in that day, it is no argument it meant nothing more. He &s;ays, an in&s;tance parallel, and a deci&s;ive illu&s;tration of it is found, Acts 2.28. where Peter applies the prophecy of Joel, "that God would pour out his Spirit upon all fle&s;h" to the out-pouring of the Spirit upon the apo&s;tles in the day of penti|co&s;t." He argues this was one thing intended, but not all; there will be a more glorious out-pouring in time to come." Granted: but this makes nothing in favour of a future bowing, beyond the day of judgment: for this out-pouring of the Spirit will certainly have its full accompli&s;hment under Chri&s;t's di&s;|pen&s;ation, in this world; and therefore is rather a deci&s;ive illu&s;|tration, that there will be no more &s;ubdual by grace, when this di&s;pen&s;ation is clo&s;ed, in the great day.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="019737_0252_0FACA80261025140">We proceed to 1 Cor. 15.24, 25, 26, 27, 28. "Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up (or &s;hall deliver up, in the greek) the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority and power: for he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed, is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he &s;aith all things are put under him, it is manife&s;t that he is excepted, which did put all things under him; and when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him, then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all." This author profe&s;&s;edly lays the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon this pa&s;|&s;age: it was the key that opened to him his &s;cheme, and he judges it &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to &s;upport it, p. 197, 8. and yet he confe&s;&s;es, p. 201, 2. that he could not deduce it from this text, without the help of his con&s;truction of Romans 5th chapter, which hath been &s;ufficiently confuted. We will examine it with attention, and &s;ee if his doctrine will &s;tand upon this foun|dation. To me it appears, that here as u&s;ual, he hath totally mi&s;taken the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, and the true key of con&s;truc|tion. He &s;ays, p. 201. "that it is evident beyond controver&s;y that the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of a univer&s;al re&s;urrection, of the whole race of Adam." Whereas it is evident, there is not a word of the re&s;urrection of the wicked, in the whole chapter; but it is wholly taken up in the de&s;cription of the importance, certainty; and glory of the re&s;urrection of the righteous only, with an&s;wering objections, &amp;c. The importance of the re&s;ur|rection is argued, upon the&s;e two grand principles, viz. the whole doctrine of chri&s;tianity depends upon it, and the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous, in particular; and the certainty of it is evinced by the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t only. And the time, manner, importance and glory of the re&s;urrection of the righ|teous, is illu&s;trated by a particular de&s;cription. Every judicious reader may &s;ee this the contents of the chapter. Chri&s;tianity depends upon this doctrine, and the denial of the re&s;urrection is de&s;truction to the whole doctrine of it, as is argued 13, 14, 15, 16 ver&s;es, "but if there be no re&s;urrection of the dead, then is Chri&s;t not ri&s;en: and if Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en, then is our preaching vain, and your faith al&s;o is vain," &amp;c. The denial of it is like|wi&s;e
<PB N="234" REF="019737_0253_0FACA80320948BB0">
de&s;truction to the chri&s;tian's faith, hope and promi&s;ed ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s, as he proceeds to argue v. 17, 18, 19th. "and if Chri&s;t be not rai&s;ed, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your &s;ins; then they al&s;o which are fallen a&s;leep in Chri&s;t, are peri&s;hed. If in this life only we have hope in Chri&s;t, we are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable." But the whole is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t alone; with which their re&s;urrection and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is connected and mo&s;t firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, by go&s;pel con&s;titution. This he argues, 20, 21, 22, 23d ver&s;es. "But now is Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead (not for him&s;elf alone, but for them that are his) and become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept." Who? them that &s;lept in Chri&s;t, who otherwi&s;e would have peri&s;hed, as v. 18. and &s;o the fir&s;t fruits to them, that his re&s;urrection is an earne&s;t of a like glorious re&s;urrection to them, wherein they will be fa&s;hioned like unto his glory. "For &s;ince by man came death, by man al&s;o came the re&s;urrection of the dead," to them who have &s;lept in Chri&s;t; it is to this immortality and glory. "For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all (that are Chri&s;t's, for of them only is he &s;peaking) be made alive." But when? at his &s;econd coming, as in the following words and paragraph. In what manner and order? "but every man in his own order: Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits, afterwards they that are Chri&s;t's at his coming." All that will be rai&s;ed to immortality and glory, will be rai&s;ed at this revealed, appointed time: and the order of every man will be adju&s;ted by the go&s;pel doctrine of retribution, according to their eminence in piety and u&s;eful|ne&s;s in this pre&s;ent world. As the apo&s;tle proceeds to explain and illu&s;trate 40, 41, 42 ver&s;es and onwards&mdash;"there are al&s;o cele&s;tial bodies, and bodies terre&s;trial, but the glory of the cel|e&s;tial is one, and the glory of the terre&s;trial is another. There is one glory of the &s;un, and another glory of the moon, and ano|ther glory of the &s;tars; for one &s;tar differeth from another in glory. So al&s;o is the re&s;urrection of the dead," in that day. The glorious qualities of the&s;e new rai&s;ed bodies of the righte|ous, clo&s;es his de&s;cription. This gives an ea&s;y and &s;ignificant &s;en&s;e "of every man in his own order:" and we prefer the apo|&s;tle, as his own expo&s;itor, much before this author. His tag|mata, troops and companies, coming out of the place of tor|ment under their own &s;tandards, are all ab&s;olutely excluded.

There is no occa&s;ion, no place for them here, nor in all revela|tion. We read of them no where but in this author, who brings gog and magog out of the place of torment, headed by the devil to inve&s;t the camp of God: which is all the tagmata of this kind we read of, which perhaps will be proved to be a &s;purious invention. From this view of the context, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, there is not a word &s;aid of the re&s;urrection of the wicked in it; nor, a word &s;aid of a re&s;urrection to immortality and glory but in the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t, the time, expre&s;sly fixed for it. The whole context, and the connexion confirms the con|&s;truction we have before given of this di&s;puted pa&s;&s;age. To proceed. Were it a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible writer, I &s;hould &s;ay, his whole rea&s;onings upon this pa&s;&s;age, are &s;ophi&s;tical: they are founded in a petio principii, a meer begging of the que&s;tion. He takes every material article for granted, which cannot be granted him; which he hath not, and never can prove. E. g. (1.) He takes for granted the future general judgment, will not be finally deci&s;ive to men; and yet offers not a &s;ingle proof that there will be any other public judgment to &s;ettle the &s;tates of mankind, good or bad. (2dly.) He takes for granted, that the putting down and &s;ubdual of all enemies here, is pious, and by willing &s;ubjection to the divine authority: when he allows the &s;ame word "&s;ubject" Rom. 8.20. is by judicial &s;entence: and when the apo&s;tle is not treating of the reduction &amp; introduction of new &s;ubjects into Chri&s;t's kingdom, but of the final &s;ettlement of it: and altogether of the external arrangement of things in the kingdom of God: and when it is again&s;t the tenor of &s;crip|ture. (3dly.) He takes for granted, Chri&s;t will continue to reign after the &s;ettlement of his kingdom in the great day, in what he calls the re&s;urrection world, until all final enemies are &s;ubdued: again&s;t the fulle&s;t te&s;timony of &s;cripture. And (4thly.) that his giving up the kingdom, and God's being all in all, is not connected in point of time, with his &s;econd com|ing, the re&s;urrection and the la&s;t judgment: whereas they are evidently &s;o connected in the paragraph it&s;elf, and throughout revelation. We read "of Chri&s;t's appearance and kingdom," his &s;econd coming and giving up the kingdom; but never of a third appearance and giving it up. But he will have them di&s;|connected with that time, and connected with a period far di&s;|tant,
<PB N="236" REF="019737_0255_0FACA804A1C98D28">
ages of ages after the judgment, no body knows when, when all enemies are &s;ubdued: which neither this text nor any others give any hint of. The&s;e are the foundation &s;upports of his &s;cheme as argued from this pa&s;&s;age; which he ought not to have taken for granted, without full, convincing proof. But we &s;hall follow him in his arguments. 1. "Though the apo|&s;tle in this paragraph, turns our view to the end of the media|tory &s;cheme, when Chri&s;t &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, yet he &s;ays, he has evidently guarded again&s;t the error, that expo&s;itors have &s;trangely run into, viz. that this &s;cheme will be fini&s;hed at the &s;econd advent of Chri&s;t, by his then, unalterably fixing the &s;tates of men good or bad," &amp;c. p. 208. He him&s;elf hath &s;trangely mi&s;taken the apo&s;tle to think otherwi&s;e; for we have proved, the la&s;t judgment is final to both; and &s;hall further confirm it. (2dly.) "It is mo&s;t per|emptorily affirmed, that an univer&s;al &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t &s;hall yet be effected; before he delivers up the kingdom." And we have &s;hewn how this will be effected in the la&s;t judgment: by &s;ettling the &s;tates of all men, in final retribution, and the kingdom of God in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, in that period and no other. (3dly.) "It is worthy of &s;pecial notice, the la&s;t enemy mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, which is death, the &s;econd death." In &s;upport of which, he &s;ays (1.) "It is evident from the tenor of the new te&s;tament, that the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer the &s;econd death." And we add, it is al&s;o evident, that it will be eternal, and they will never be delivered from it. But he adds (2dly) "this death may with as much propriety be called any enemy, as the fir&s;t death." We &s;ay no, the fir&s;t death is con&s;idered as an enemy, as while it reigns it holds or bars the righteous from the full and compleat enjoyment of their promi&s;ed inheritance. Therefore it is &s;poken of as an enemy to them, and the la&s;t that &s;hall be de&s;troyed in the day of their redemption and glorious adoption: in this view, and in this only, the apo&s;tle treats of it in this text and context. But the &s;econd death doth not hold the wicked from any promi&s;ed inheritance, for "they have no inheritance in the kingdom of God:" therefore it is no enemy to them, in that &s;en&s;e, in which the fir&s;t death, is to the righte|ous. The &s;econd death, is the puni&s;hment appointed of God for the final enemies of God and of mankind. It is friendly to

mankind in the threatning, to warn and &s;ave them from that place of torment; and in the execution of it, it may an&s;wer an everla&s;ting good purpo&s;e in the great kingdom of Jehovah: it is no enemy to the people of God, they &s;hall not be hurt of it, and in it their enemies will be put down under an impo&s;&s;ibility of injuring them. It is no enemy to the authority and govern|ment of &s;upreme Jehovah, but a great &s;upport of it. It is no more an enemy in the government of God, than capital puni&s;h|ments to traitors and murderers, is in the governments of men. In a word, it is not here or any where el&s;e in &s;cripture &s;poken of as an enemy to be de&s;troyed: and therefore the fir&s;t and &s;econd death, come under &s;uch an exceeding different con&s;truction, that there is no arguing from the de&s;truction of the fir&s;t, to that of the &s;econd. He adds (3dly.) this &s;econd death &s;trictly and properly is the la&s;t enemy, and the only one that is &s;o: it is &s;aid to have no exi&s;tence, till after the fir&s;t death is &s;o far de&s;troyed, as that the wicked are rai&s;ed to life, and then ca&s;t into the lake of fire which is the &s;econd death, p. 210, 211. There are tho&s;e who maintain the intermediate &s;tate, to be a &s;tate of &s;ufferings to the wicked. Our Lord teaches it, in the parable of dives: and Peter &s;peaks of the di&s;obedient &s;pirits in pri&s;on before the re&s;urrection. But if, as hath been &s;hewn, it is no enemy to be de&s;troyed, it is neither fir&s;t nor la&s;t, nor any of the enemies which come within the de&s;cription in this text: and perhaps we &s;hall prove it is eternal, and then there is no hope&mdash;it can never be de&s;troyed: &s;o that his "unan&s;werable rea&s;ons" do not conclude with any force. His 4th general argument is, "It is with a great deal of clearne&s;s and particularity a&s;&s;erted, in this &s;crip|ture, that Chri&s;t &s;hall not give up his tru&s;t, till he has in fact and event &s;ubdued all enemies, p. 214. We reply, This is done in fact and event, when he hath put all moral enemies down in a &s;tate of retribution, by &s;entence and execution, in the la&s;t judg|ment. Nor hath he &s;aid any thing to purpo&s;e in di&s;proof, nor can he po&s;&s;ibly di&s;prove it. 5thly. "In the la&s;t place, it rea|dily falls in with the ob&s;ervation of every attentive reader of this paragraph, that the reign of Chri&s;t in his mediatory kingdom, is to make way for God's being all in all; and will accordingly la&s;t, till he hath ripened and prepared things for the commence|ment of that glorious period," p. 217. Two remarks, may &s;et
<PB N="238" REF="019737_0257_0FACA80620D29E50">
this matter in a true light. Rem. 1. Neither this text or any other teach, that Chri&s;t will reign any longer as the &s;aviour and judge of men, than to the judgment of the great day. His parables, and the whole tenor of &s;cripture, point to this, as ter|minating his reign, as Saviour and Judge. Rem. 2. He will in fact and event in that day, put down all enemies under his feet, and perform the whole work in this pa&s;&s;age, a&s;cribed to his reign: for, he will then put down all inimical 'rule,' 'power' and 'authority,' which is one part of the de&s;cription; and de|&s;troy "natural death" the la&s;t enemy of the righteous, and cau&s;e them to &s;ing in triumph "O death, where is thy &s;ting?" "O grave, where is thy victory?" v. 55. which is another thing de&s;cribed: and he will put down all moral enemies by &s;entence and execution, in a &s;tate of retribution: each particular and the whole work here a&s;&s;igned to his reign, is then compleated. And &s;urely, his reign is then fini&s;hed, when this work is effec|ted: and this mu&s;t be the thing intended. And to confirm it, it may be noted, that all the predictions and declarations of his putting down all enemies, agree in this manner of it; and no other. Thus in the 110th pla&s;m here referred to, his enemies and his people are contradi&s;tingui&s;hed. "He mu&s;t reign till his enemies are made his foot&s;tool," v. 1. "His people &s;hall be made willing in the day of his power," that is, in the di&s;pen|&s;ation of his kingdom, power and grace in this world, v. 2, 3. but in the day of his 'wrath' his enemies will be de&s;troyed, v. 5, 6. So where it is quoted Heb. 11 chapter, we have &s;hewn this judicial putting down all enemies, mu&s;t be the thing inten|ded, for no other con&s;truction will inforce the admonition, as there de&s;igned by it. So Heb. 10.13. "From henceforth expecting, till his enemies be made his foot&s;tool." He is wait|ing, expecting the la&s;t act of his regal, judicial, &s;upreme power to compleat the de&s;ign of his exaltation and kingdom (the &s;al|vation of his people being fir&s;t accompli&s;hed), viz. "in making his enemies his foot&s;tool. As how? In their &s;ubdual by grace? we read not a word of that: but we read in the &s;ame chapter "of fiery indignation which &s;hall devour the adver&s;aries" in a more terrible puni&s;hment, than any &s;uffered under the law of Mo&s;es. "And we know him that hath &s;aid, vengeance belong|eth unto me, I will recompence &s;aith the Lord." "And again
<PB N="239" REF="019737_0258_0FACA806E1AC77D8">
the Lord &s;hall judge his people: it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God," v. 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31&s;t. This &s;urely is not the language of making them his foot&s;tool by grace, but vengeance. The &s;ame la&s;t act of his power and reign in his kingdom before it is given up, is repre&s;ented by John the bapti&s;t. "He &s;hall fir&s;t gather the wheat into his garner;" and then, "burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." So in each of the parables of our Saviour, the righteous are fir&s;t &s;e|cured; then, the wicked are puni&s;hed. And in the exhibition he gives us of the la&s;t judgment, 25 Mat. the righteous &s;hall fir&s;t be in&s;tated in the kingdom prepared for them; and then, the enemies, the wicked &s;hall be put down and con&s;igned over as "accur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire," and "go away into ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment." And this, perhaps, lets us into the true rea&s;on, why Paul makes this &s;olemn pau&s;e, and in&s;erts this pa|ragraph. The glorious reward of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be perfected, in his triumphant, infinite exaltation over all his enemies, who have di&s;puted, oppo&s;ed and bla&s;phemed his reign: and the kingdom of God be &s;ettled in perfect retribution, as well to the wicked as righteous, before it be given up. And it is wi&s;ely de&s;igned for the &s;upport and &s;ecurity of &s;uffering chri&s;tians in all their per&s;ecutions and trials, and for &s;olemn warning to all men, to guard them from error, apo&s;tacy and wickedne&s;s, as what will be infallibly fatal. Becau&s;e all moral enemies mu&s;t be put down in eternal di&s;grace and ruin, at the time when all other enemies &s;hall be de&s;troyed; to compleat the full de&s;ign of our Lord's exaltation and kingdom. He had in&s;erted "the coming of Chri&s;t," "the end," "the giving up the kingdom," as all coincident, in that grand period: but mi&s;take not, &s;ays he, it will not be compleated till he hath exerci&s;ed the la&s;t grand act of his &s;upreme regal and judicial power in de&s;troying all natural, and putting down all moral enemies under foot, by righteous &s;entence and execution; as taught and notified by the prophets, by the forerunner of Chri&s;t, and by our Lord him|&s;elf; and thereby, hath &s;ettled the kingdom in perfection and everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. Then, will he re&s;ign up the admi|ni&s;tration and kingdom. This is by far the mo&s;t natural and u&s;eful con&s;truction; and be&s;t harmonizes with the current doc|trine of revelation: and before we have done, it will appear the
<PB N="240" REF="019737_0259_0FACA807A277DA40">
only one, that it will bear. He tells us, "it is remarkable, this prophecy in P&s;alms, is five times applied to Chri&s;t, in the new te&s;tament," p. 216. It is &s;ufficient to reply; it is as "remar|kable" in all the&s;e times it hath not the lea&s;t reference to his con&s;truction: which is a tacit refutation of it. Now, &s;ince there is but one &s;ubdual of all enemies taught in this pa&s;&s;age; and it is clear, each part of this de&s;cription, and the whole of this work a&s;cribed to the reign of Chri&s;t, will in fact and event, be literally compleated in that day: his tenet of an after or continued reign for their &s;ubdual by grace, is ab&s;olutely exclu|ded. Then, the &s;aints will be taken up with Chri&s;t, to the man&s;ions promi&s;ed and prepared for them, and "will be ever with the Lord." Certainly, the &s;cripture doth not countenance any notion, that he will de&s;cend a third time, to reign in a new earth and re&s;urrection world.</P>
<P>A brief recapitulation and arrangement of what hath been before and now offered upon this pa&s;&s;age, may give the reader, a proper advantage of judging of the con&s;i&s;tence and force of the whole, to e&s;tabli&s;hed the con&s;truction we have given of it, and to refute the other. It appears (1.) there is nothing &s;aid in the context, of the re&s;urrection of the wicked, or to counte|nance his con&s;truction; but it every way favours that which we have given. (2dly.) We before proved, that the apo&s;tle is here treating of an external arrangement of the kingdom of God, in way of governmental regulation; and not of introducing new &s;ubjects into it, in a &s;ubdual by grace: &s;o that our con&s;truction entirely falls in with the &s;ubject he is treating of; but his, is altogether be&s;ide it. (3dly.) It is very evident, that all ene|mies will in fact and event be de&s;troyed and &s;ubdued; and the whole work as de&s;cribed in this text and every part of it, will be literally effected and compleated in the great day: and all moral enemies will be put under his feet and made his foot&s;tool by the la&s;t great act of his &s;upreme regal power, as predicted by the prophets, by the forerunner of Chri&s;t, and repeatedly taught by our Saviour and the apo&s;tles to be exerci&s;ed in the perfect &s;ettlement of his kingdom in retribution, for eternity. And (4thly.) as there is but one &s;ubdual of all enemies, and but one time of effecting it taught in the text; &s;o with this &s;ub|dual then effected, when all enemies &s;hall be ca&s;t out of his
<PB N="241" REF="019737_0260_0FACA808608A75A8">
kingdom, is expre&s;sly connected, the delivering up the king|dom. After which, there is no pretention of &s;ubdual or reduc|tion of enemies, to be brought into it. And (5thly.) it is fur|ther certain, from the repeated declarations of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, that he will reign over them no longer, for their &s;ubdual by grace. For, he hath repeatedly a&s;&s;ured us, the workers of ini|quity &s;hall then be ca&s;t out of his kingdom, from the means, grace and ble&s;&s;ings of it, and accur&s;ed, devoted to utter ruin. Now to &s;uppo&s;e his reign over them any longer, is as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e the continued reign of the governments of this world, over tho&s;e &s;ubjects who have been cut off from them by capital execution: the &s;uppo&s;ition, is a palpable contradiction. It is to &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame &s;ubjects are both in and out of the &s;ame kingdom, at the &s;ame time: which is as &s;taring a contradiction as can be named. Once more, (6thly.) we have proved, the la&s;t judgment will be final, to all men, both good and bad. It is gro&s;sly ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e, the infinitely wi&s;e Governour and Judge of the world, &s;hould make &s;uch an imperfect &s;ettle|ment of his kingdom in that day, in the view of the whole moral creation; as to need another, as much as ever&mdash;it is, if po&s;&s;ible, more ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, he will execute the office of Judge, before he hath fini&s;hed his work as a Saviour&mdash;and full as ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, after he hath compleated his whole great work as a Judge, he &s;hould go on to reign as a Saviour, over &s;ubjects ca&s;t out, and remaining ca&s;t out of his kingdom; with a view to reduce and &s;ave them in &s;ome blind, hidden way, no body knows where, when or how, and finally admit them into the kingdom without public judgment: and that this blind doctrine &s;hould be an article of the chri&s;tian faith.&mdash;And no ab&s;urdity can exceed the &s;uppo&s;ition, that for the &s;ake of &s;tubborn, ob&s;tinate enemies, the Lord of glory &s;hould be prevented the final &s;ettlement of his kingdom, and &s;aints be kept out of the heavenly inheritance: and that all the hopes of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this inheritance, to all the innumera|ble miriads of the redeemed and &s;aved, &s;hould in fact be &s;u&s;pen|ded upon the vertue of the mo&s;t abandoned, mercile&s;s and in|veterate of enemies. Again&s;t all the&s;e impious, horrible ab|&s;urdities, we have proved, the future judgment is exhibited as deci&s;ive, perfect and final in all the particular de&s;criptions of it
<PB N="242" REF="019737_0261_0FACA80921016EB0">
throughout revelation:&mdash;that all the hopes and fears of good and bad men in &s;cripture are ab&s;olutely concentered, in the de|ci&s;ions of that day, as final:&mdash;that it has been the faith of good men in all ages&mdash;and the general fear and dread of the wicked through the earth&mdash;to all which, may be added; it is known to be final by the devils: they believe and tremble in the ap|prehen&s;ion of it, as &s;uch; as &s;eems evident from their addre&s;s to our Saviour, "Art thou come to torment us, to de&s;troy us be|fore the time?" It would be &s;ad indeed, if the faith of chri&s;ti|ans, &s;hould fall &s;hort of that of devils, in an article of &s;uch va&s;t importance: which may well &s;hame this mo&s;t ab&s;urd and per|nicious notion, out of the chri&s;tian world. Now, if the future judgment be final, as hath been proved, and I tru&s;t before we quit the &s;ubject will be put out of all doubt, the &s;ubduing all enemies can admit no other con&s;truction but that we have given, a &s;ubdual by grace is ab&s;olutely excluded, as being an impo&s;&s;i|bility, again&s;t the force of a final &s;entence. It is now &s;ubmit|ted, to the reader, whether the con&s;truction we have given be not rational, con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, with the context, and with the current doctrine of &s;cripture. If &s;o, whether this author's reflection be ju&s;t, p. 226. "No wonder this has been reckoned among the dark and difficult texts in the apo&s;tle Paul's writings, while men have endeavoured to fa&s;ten a &s;en&s;e upon it, that really &s;ets it at variance with it&s;elf, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a reconciliation by any human &s;kill: whereas, according to the &s;en&s;e he hath given, the meaning is quite ea&s;y, and yet con&s;i&s;t|ent." That it has been reckoned a dark and difficult text, is very true, but that it is "beyond human &s;kill to give it a con|&s;i&s;tent con&s;truction" upon the common faith of the chri&s;tian world, is by no means true. The contrary, I tru&s;t, is already clear, and will &s;oon be more evident. Whereas his con&s;truction is already confuted and will be repeatedly &s;o, in the farther di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of his &s;cheme.&mdash;Upon this text, he opens his general &s;cheme&punc; and taken in connexion with the millennium de&s;cribed 20th Rev. and the new heavens and earth de&s;cribed Rev. 21. and 22d chapters&punc; he gives us his whole plan, of the &s;ubdual of all enemies, and of Chri&s;t's continuing to reign for the accom|pli&s;hment of it, and then giving up the kingdom, as he &s;uppo&s;es is intended in this paragraph. I would therefore, give an ex|hibit
<PB N="243" REF="019737_0262_0FACA809E567BAB8">
of his general &s;cheme, in the collected parts of it, in one connected view; make my remarks, and come to a general &s;ettlement upon it, in this place. To introduce it, he &s;ays, "it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h between the&s;e two, "periods," that wherein the mediatory kingdom is in the hands of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that when God as king, will be all in all," p. 217, 218. we &s;ay, it is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e two manners of admini&s;t|ration of the &s;ame kingdom; and that the one ends and the other commences, at one and the &s;ame period, of the la&s;t judg|ment: and then his word 'period' will neither make him mi&s;t|ake, nor mi&s;lead us. He next &s;ays, "the reign of Chri&s;t takes in the whole &s;pace from his exaltation, till all enemies, all hu|man kind are reduced under due &s;ubjection to God." But, he hath not proved it; and we have proved the contrary. He repeats it again, this will prepare the way for the other grand period, &amp;c. All without proof. All this taken for granted, he next divides the reign of Chri&s;t into two periods: the fir&s;t takes in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence to the end of this world: the other, he &s;ays, takes in that which intervenes between the general re&s;urrection and la&s;t judgment; and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e when "God &s;hall be all in all." He imagines there is a ju&s;t founda|tion to &s;peak of &s;uch a period: we have proved the&s;e is no foundation for it, and doubt not to do it to full &s;atisfaction; on which his &s;cheme mu&s;t be up, for ever. His &s;cheme of the reign of Chri&s;t, in this &s;econd period in the re&s;urrection world, as collected from &s;everal parts of his book, is this, viz. "The &s;entence in the la&s;t judgment will con&s;ign the righteous to an age of happine&s;s, and the wicked to an age of puni&s;hment, in the new earth: for the word eternal, he &s;ays, &s;ignifies a cer|tain period, age, "or di&s;pen&s;ation," p. 224. and tells us, the new earth will be "one part a hell for the wicked," and the other "heaven for the righteous," p. 394. and tells us, the pro|mi&s;es of the go&s;pel, re&s;pect this re&s;urrection &s;tate and world; and are not promi&s;es of the eternal life and inheritance, which they &s;hall enjoy, when the kingdom is given up, and "God is all in all." And "the threatnings to the wicked all re&s;pect this &s;tate and period likewi&s;e, p. 222, 223. al&s;o, that Chri&s;t will reign in this re&s;urrection world, over the righteous, di&s;pen&s;ing a glorious reward and happine&s;s to them; and over the wicked
<PB N="244" REF="019737_0263_0FACA80AA1978490">
in way of puni&s;hment and grace, with &s;uitable means to make them a willing people. And in this period and "next &s;tate in hell" all the wicked &s;hall literally and univer&s;ally, die the &s;e|cond death, p. 312, 313. "upon which di&s;&s;olution of &s;oul and body, they will have no more concern with that world, than they have with this, upon the coming on of the fir&s;t death," p. 281. that for a thou&s;and years, the &s;aints &s;hall reign, "un|mole&s;ted:" but at the end of it, tho&s;e wicked dead ones, &s;hall be quickened and live again. For die they mu&s;t in that "next &s;tate" before they go out of it, as hath been &s;aid, to &s;upport his expo&s;ition of Mark 9th. and live again they mu&s;t, for the work he a&s;&s;igns to them, viz. "being found on earth, to go forth, to the four corners of it, and "over&s;pread the &s;urface of it," "headed by the devil, with tempers fierce and cruel exactly fitted" for their predatory expedition of making one grand a&s;|&s;ault, upon the camp of God; to an&s;wer the de&s;cription and do the work a&s;&s;igned to Gog and Magog, Rev. 20. 8, 9. p. 394. and &s;uch &s;hall be the fears and dangers of the whole camp of God, from their "formidable appearance" as to be &s;aved from de&s;truction, only by the extraordinary interpo&s;ition of God, con&s;uming "this rabble rout of adver&s;aries," by fire from hea|ven, ibid, and p. 382, with the text. Here we find them, die the &s;econd death, live again and dead again the third death, and yet not &s;aved. How doth this comport with "their being tormented day and night forever and ever? Rev. 20.10. we are told this means 'ages,' '&s;tates' and 'di&s;pen&s;ations,' (p. 309) into which they &s;hall be "tran&s;muted," into one, and if &s;tubborn and un&s;ubdued in the fir&s;t tran&s;mutation, they mu&s;t die again, be quickened and tran&s;muted into another, no body knows to what number: for it is &s;aid, "wicked men may not be &s;ubdued, till they have again and again, in this and the other form of exi&s;tence, &s;uffered torment, that &s;hall end in death:" the re&s;ult of which &s;hall finally be, their re&s;urrection to reign in life forever," p. 404. In the mean time, while the wicked are under this di&s;cipline, we are told the &s;aints (after that a&s;&s;ault) &s;hall go on to reign unmole&s;ted, for ages of ages, cotemporary, with tho&s;e of the wicked, which is &s;aid to be the meaning of their "reigning forever and ever," Rev. 22.5. and when this la&s;t re&s;urrection of the wicked is compleated, at the end of "for|ever
<PB N="245" REF="019737_0264_0FACA80B614F1980">
and ever," then the la&s;t period &s;hall commence: "when &s;in, &s;atan, death, the &s;econd as well as the fir&s;t death &s;hall be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, and the whole human race be reduced under a free and full &s;ubjection to the government of God," "the kingdom be given up," and "God be all in all."</P>
<P>This I take to be the &s;cheme ju&s;tly delineated: upon which I would make two or three general remarks, and then give a more particular attention to the &s;everal parts of it.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t view, that heaven, earth and hell &s;hould all be found, and be compri&s;ed in "one earth," &s;eems as romantick as Dr. Burnett's gog and magog made out of the &s;lime of the earth; which he &s;ays, "needs no &s;erious refutation." I would next remark, that his new earth doth not well agree with St. John's in the 21&s;t and 22d chapters of the revelations, which he &s;up|po&s;es to be the &s;ame. In St. John's "there is no &s;ea" of tur|bulent &s;pirits; in his, there are gog and magog, the mo&s;t furious of all turbulents. In St. John's, "there are no more cries and tears:" in his, millions are con&s;igned "to weeping, wailing and gna&s;hing of teath." Again, in St. John's "there is no more cur&s;e," "no more death;" in his, the&s;e multitudes of mi&s;erables, endure all the cur&s;es of the book of God, and die the mo&s;t tremendous of all deaths, the &s;econd death. Upon which di&s;&s;olution, they have no more concern with that world than the dead have with this. Which leads to a third remark, it is impo&s;&s;ible upon his own &s;cheme, that his gog and magog &s;hould be the &s;ame, as is intended in the prophecy: for, his &s;cheme &s;ays, they were con&s;igned to an age of torment in hell; and could not come out of that &s;tate till they died there; and that then they had no more concern with it, than the dead have with this. Con&s;equently, they mu&s;t have died there before they could come out: and when quicken'd, mu&s;t be tran&s;muted to &s;ome other &s;tate, where they would have no more concern with that new earth world, than the dead have with this. For cer|tain, when quickened from the &s;econd death, they cannot be found there, roving over the four quarters of that earth, medi|tating and attempting an a&s;&s;ault upon the camp of God: be|cau&s;e, before they died, they belonged to that new earth, re&s;ur|rection world; they lived in it, were tormented and died in it, and can no more belong to it, after death. His wrong notion
<PB N="246" REF="019737_0265_0FACA80C20CD9D10">
of this death, and of ages in the future &s;tate (which will be refuted hereafter) forces him upon the ab&s;urd doctrine of tran&s;|mutation into different &s;tates and worlds. Let it be noted, once for all, the &s;cripture knows and teaches but two &s;tates and worlds for mankind; the one vi&s;ible, the other invi&s;ible; the one temporary, the other eternal. Now, his gog and magog were in the invi&s;ible, new earth, re&s;urrection world: that world where he &s;ays heaven, earth and hell are: there they lived and died, and have no more concerns with it. Certainly then, they cannot infe&s;t the camp of God there, where they have no con|cern, no more than the dead can infe&s;t us, who are living. Be&s;ides, on his general plan, when quickened, they are tran&s;|muted to another &s;tate and world, than that to which they be|fore belonged; with which, after death, they have no more concern. I a&s;k, what world is it? it cannot be the re&s;urrection world, or that world where heaven, earth and hell are; for this they belonged to before. It mu&s;t it &s;eems be then, an anoni|mal, new-created world: and as often as they die and are quickened again, new worlds and &s;tates mu&s;t be created, to accommodate their tran&s;mutation. Can any thing be more irrational, romantick and incredible?</P>
<P>To introduce the more particular remarks which follow, I would ob&s;erve, the apo&s;tle in&s;erts the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, and the reign of Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years; with the &s;ub&s;equent attempt of gog and magog, before the general re&s;urrection and la&s;t judgment. This author tran&s;po&s;es the whole after the judg|ment, into the new earth, as hath been noted. Why this arbi|trary tran&s;po&s;ition, without nece&s;&s;ity? Why is not the com|monly received opinion, the truth? viz. that this fir&s;t is a &s;pi|ritual re&s;urrection of the church of God, to reign in eminence and glory in the &s;pirit, purity and practice of genuine chri&s;tiani|ty, for a long period, termed a thou&s;and years, in this world, before the la&s;t judgment. He &s;ays no, it means the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection in kind, to reign in eternal life. It implies a &s;econd, in which the wicked when fitted for it, will be rai&s;ed in companies in the &s;ame kind of re&s;urrection: and &s;ays, the true &s;eries of events is this: that after the de&s;truction of antichri&s;t, &s;atan will be bound in the bottomle&s;s pit, as Rev. 20th. 1, 2, 3 ver&s;es: that the next event will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> re&s;urrection &amp; la&s;t judg|ment,

as &s;et forth from v. 11th, to the end of the chapter: and that the whole account from the 3d to the 11th v. belongs to his re&s;urrection world, p. 370, 1, 2. If the reader would &s;ee the common con&s;truction vindicated, and a literal re&s;urrection as here contended for, &s;olidly confuted, he may con&s;ult Dr. Whitby's &s;elect treati&s;e on the &s;ubject, and Mr. Lowman on this pa&s;&s;age. But without regard to what they have &s;aid, I mu&s;t follow this author in his peculiar notion. He a&s;&s;igns three rea&s;ons, as in&s;uperable difficulties, again&s;t the received con|&s;truction. (1.) "The fir&s;t re&s;urrection implies a &s;econd, but a &s;econd in kind there cannot be, for this will be the la&s;t, and the judgment in&s;tantly &s;ucceed," p. 382. (2.) That in&s;tantly, after a thou&s;and years reign of genuine chri&s;tianity, there &s;hould be found &s;uch &s;warms of abandoned wicked men "as to com|po&s;e gog and magog, here de&s;cribed as the &s;ands of the &s;ea, "it is &s;aid exceeds all belief." A (3d) is, that the coming of our Saviour, is compared to the coming on of the flood in the days of Noah, for the univer&s;ally prevalent wickedne&s;s of the earth, Mat. 24.37, 38, 39: and when he comes, it is &s;aid &s;hall he find faith in the earth, Luke 18.8. The coming of our Saviour in the&s;e texts, I take to be his coming to the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and not to final judgment: and the di&s;obedient to be puni&s;hed at his &s;econd coming, as de&s;cribed 2 The&s;. 1. 7, 8, 9, are the finally di&s;obedient of all ages and generations, and not of that generation only, which preceeds the judgment. The&s;e texts therefore, to me appear be&s;ide the purpo&s;e. The other objections de&s;erve attention. As to the fir&s;t objection: This glorious &s;tate of the church may be termed the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection of it, not in kind, (it is conceeded to be the la&s;t of that &s;ort) but in reference to the general re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t; when all the &s;ons of God will be manife&s;ted, in all their glory. It will certainly bear, by far, the mo&s;t clear and lively re&s;emb|lance of the glory and happine&s;s of the church in that day, of any &s;tate of it, ever &s;een in this world: and on the ground of this re&s;emblance, may with great propriety be termed, a fir&s;t re&s;urrection. I &s;ee no difficulty in it, for the apo&s;tle doth not limit it to the &s;ame kind of re&s;urrection, nor hath any one au|thority to do it. This con&s;truction heightens and aggrandizes our views of the eminence, glory and importance of this &s;tate
<PB N="248" REF="019737_0267_0FACA80DA1877F00">
of the church in this world, and of that mo&s;t intere&s;ting period to mankind; which &s;eems the direct intention of the apo&s;tle. What can aggrandize our conceptions of it more, than to be taught, that under this long, glorious reign of Chri&s;t, &s;uch will be his &s;ubjects for multitude, moral excellency and happine&s;s, as to exhibit a very lively re&s;emblance of the general, glorious re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t? As to his &s;econd objection: "That in&s;tantly after &s;uch a long and happy reign of pure religion, and immediately preceeding the judgment," as he repre&s;ents it, p. 383, 4, "&s;uch &s;warms of wicked men &s;hould be found on earth," would upon this &s;tating, I confe&s;s, be incredible; but when the mi&s;tating of the fact is corrected, and the text it&s;elf is con&s;ulted, the &s;cripture account is perfectly credible. It &s;tands thus, Rev. 20. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9. "And I &s;aw an angel come down from hea|ven, having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit, and a great chain in his hand: and he laid hold on the dragon that old &s;erpent, which is the devil and &s;atan, and bound him a thou&s;and years, and ca&s;t him into the bottomle&s;s pit, and &s;hut him up, and &s;et a &s;eal upon him, that he &s;hould deceive the nati|ons no more, till the thou&s;and years &s;hould be fulfilled: and after that, he mu&s;t be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on." "And when the thou&s;and years are expired, &s;atan &s;hall be loo&s;ed out of his pri|&s;on, and &s;hall go out to deceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth, gog and magog, to gather them to|gather to battle, the number of whom is as the &s;and of the &s;ea. And they went out on the breadth of the earth, and compa&s;&s;ed the camp of the &s;aints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."&mdash; Upon which I ob&s;erve (1.) 'tis certain, when &s;atan is bound, mankind are living as nations in this world, according to the common cour&s;e of it. This is allowed. And it is &s;aid his con|finement is before the judgment. (2dly) It is fully and &s;trongly implied, that they would continue to live as nations in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, on this &s;ame earth, during the whole thou&s;and years in a &s;tate liable to be deceived. To prevent which is the a&s;&s;igned rea&s;on in the text, wherefore &s;atan is bound. It is thence certain, the re&s;urrection and general judgment cannot be the next event, to his being bound. For if the nations were to be immediately &s;ummoned to judgement and con&s;igned to
<PB N="249" REF="019737_0268_0FACA80E63285DC0">
their future &s;tate, the very cau&s;e of his re&s;traint would be of cour&s;e &s;uper&s;eded and made void: there would be no nations for him to deceive, nor any rea&s;on why he &s;hould be bound to prevent it. The &s;uppo&s;ition of this next event, is a manife&s;t, ab&s;urd incon&s;i&s;tency. And (3dly.) it is as fully and &s;trongly im|plied, as well can be, that mankind &s;hould continue as nations upon this &s;ame earth, during this whole period; and under this circum&s;tance of di&s;tingui&s;hed happine&s;s, above all other periods of time, "that they &s;hould be exempt from his deceptive wiles." It is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted that "the &s;eal is upon him," and that he &s;hould deceive the nations no more, till the thou&s;and years be fulfilled." This cannot be after the judgment: for there will be no nations on earth to be exempt from his wiles. It cannot be applied to tho&s;e in hell, for they are deceived and undone by his delu&s;ions. It is every way clear from the text it&s;elf, that this happy millennium &s;tate will be in this world, before the general judgment. It &s;eems, it will not admit of any other con&s;i&s;tent con&s;truction. (4thly.) This re&s;traint is limited and temporary; the term is fixed, and when it is expired, it is expre&s;sly &s;aid "he mu&s;t be loo&s;ed a little &s;ea&s;on." Certainly, this "little time" is long enough for him to do his horrid work of deceiving the nations again; and of cour&s;e it is long enough for us to account for it: for in&s;piration doth not give us an account that is incredible. This corrects the mi&s;tating of the fact: "that the millennium immediately preceeds the judg|ment; and that in&s;tantly &s;uch &s;warms of wicked men appear on earth." For this "little time" intervenes between the two e|vents: and nece&s;&s;ity obligeth us to conclude it long enough, for the whole work narrated, to be effected in it. It is in&s;erted for this very purpo&s;e. This alone is &s;ufficient to &s;ilence and remove the objection. (5thly.) The continued account, 7, 8 ver&s;es, teaches "&s;atan is loo&s;ed and comes out of his pri&s;on" alone, and not bringing gog and magog with him. They were not ca&s;t in with him, they do not come out with him, they never were there; for the text &s;peaks of them as living among the nations of the earth, who are repre&s;ented as dwelling in the four quarters of the earth in the &s;ame manner, after, as before his re&s;traint, and as they had been all along, during the time of it. They could not be tho&s;e, before deceived by him, tor|mented
<PB N="250" REF="019737_0269_0FACA80F29A915B8">
with him, and who had died a &s;econd death in hell: for he goes forth to deceive them, whom he had been hitherto re&s;trained from deceiving; and not any who were undone by his delu&s;ions. The whole of this plain account is all in favour of the common con&s;truction, that the millennium is before the re&s;urrection and judgment, and is a full ju&s;tification of it: and is irreconcilable with his, which places it after the judgment. The activity of &s;atan when loo&s;ed is great, extended over the four quarters of the earth; his arts doubtle&s;s employed upon the le&s;s enlightened and mo&s;t likely to be deceived of the nati|ons of the earth: and his &s;ucce&s;s is great, the deceived "are as the &s;and of the &s;ea." But what is there at fir&s;t &s;ight, incredi|ble in all this? This "little time" as hath been noted, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient. If any one finds him&s;elf diffi|culted, let him &s;uppo&s;e this little time, but a twentieth part of the thou&s;and years, to which, it &s;eems compared; fifty years; or, a fortieth part, which gives twenty-five years: if he con&s;ult human nature, facts, and the natural circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, he will find time fully &s;ufficient, to account for it. We know how a common cau&s;e of vertue, will in&s;pirit men: how &s;oon did the &s;pirit of it pervade, and combine millions upon this continent? what great things were atchieved, again&s;t the great|e&s;t oppo&s;ition, in a little time, eight years? and the pa&s;&s;ions of evil men are u&s;ually more violent, and their activity greater in pur&s;uing their enterprizes, than the vertuous. How ea&s;ily unprincipled men are deceived, and how impetuous their pa&s;&s;i|ons, when &s;poil in abundance is their object, is well known, as was with gog and magog in Ezekiel, who&s;e &s;pirit is here de|&s;cribed. And when evil and mi&s;chievous men break loo&s;e from re&s;traints, they are very apt to precipitate into great exce&s;s and violence. And it is well known that very great things have in fact been done in a little time, by the united arts of intrigue, deception and violence, as in the &s;udden ri&s;e, and exten&s;ive &s;pread of the mahometan empire, and other in&s;tances. And natural circum&s;tances &s;hew how tempting the object and enter|prize, in this ca&s;e. From the flowing abundance of hundreds of years of peace and plenty, and when under an extraordinary ble&s;&s;ing, from God: as al&s;o from the flattering pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s, in going again&s;t a people unu&s;ed to arms, having for &s;ome
<PB N="251" REF="019737_0270_0FACA80FE247ECB8">
hundreds of years beat their &s;words into plow&s;hears, and lived in the &s;weete&s;t harmony and peace, under the influence of that charity, which thinketh no evil: and therefore might readily be thought to be ea&s;ily &s;urprized, plundered and taken. And when in addition to all this, is con&s;idered the extraordinary pains to deceive, unite and cement all the wicked in the four quarters of the earth, in this grand enterprize; it &s;eems very ea&s;y to conceive, in le&s;s than twenty years, a number from the &s;everal nations, might be inliegued and combined in it, as large as that of Judah and I&s;rael in the days of Solomon, who are &s;aid to be "as the &s;and by the &s;ea," 1 Kings 4.20. Nothing is here taken for granted, but what is natural and &s;uppo&s;able, and the conclu&s;ion deduced is altogether credible. In a word, every part &amp; circum&s;tance in the whole account pleads &s;trongly for it to &s;tand in the connexion, where in&s;piration hath placed it; before the la&s;t judgment: and as &s;trongly, again&s;t the tran&s;|po&s;ition of it, to his re&s;urrection world. The objections be|ing removed, and the common faith of chri&s;tians &s;ufficiently confirmed; I proceed to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome greater difficulties a|gain&s;t his tran&s;po&s;ition, and other parts of his &s;cheme. His notion of this binding of &s;atan in the bottomle&s;s pit, as the next event immediately preceeding the judgment, and to continue a thou&s;and years, is directly oppo&s;ed to plain &s;cripture: for the devil and his angels, are re&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains of dark|ne&s;s to the judgment of the great day, Jude 6. and as &s;ure to be brought into judgment in that day, as the unju&s;t men, who are re&s;erved to it. If the devil here be a collective noun, as he &s;ays may be, v. 10th, p. 294, including the devil and his angels, they are all chained and &s;ealed in the bottomle&s;s pit, before the judg|ment, and to continue &s;o for a thou&s;and years: and their appear|ance in the general judgment, is an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility. And how &s;hall the &s;aints be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with Chri&s;t, to judge the angels as he repre&s;ents? p. 281. As certain therefore, as the&s;e fallen angels &s;hall appear in the judgment of the great day, &s;o certainly fal&s;e, it &s;eems, mu&s;t his con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age be. A plan to &s;ave all men, and to &s;ave the devil and his angels from the future judgment al&s;o, mu&s;t be very extraordinary. Had the writer perceived this con&s;equence, we tru&s;t he would not have adopted his con&s;truction. Again, his notion of the wicked's
<PB N="252" REF="019737_0271_0FACA810A159B840">
di&s;turbing and terrifying the &s;aints of God in the future world is directly oppo&s;ed to, and confuted by many &s;criptures. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> confuted by the &s;cripture doctrine of the future judgment, which in all de&s;criptions of it exhibits the wicked in an utter incapa|city of di&s;turbing or injuring the &s;aints of God. After judg|ment, the wicked are repre&s;ented, "burnt up as an oven," "de&s;troyed," "impri&s;oned in a &s;tate of clo&s;e confinement," "ca&s;t into the lake of fire," &amp;c. How is it po&s;&s;ible, chaff and tares, &s;evered from the wheat and burnt up with unquenchable fire, &s;hould ever injure the wheat gathered into a place of per|fect &s;afety? or, "the wicked &s;ent into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, &s;hould mole&s;t the righteous?&mdash;it is confuted by the con&s;tant repre&s;entations of the future &s;ecurity &amp; ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righ|teous. It is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with their promi&s;ed everla&s;ting re&s;t: with the &s;ecurity of their trea&s;ures in heaven, where no de&s;troyer or di&s;turber can ever come: and with their perpetu|ally enjoying the pre&s;ence and beholding the face of God and the Lamb forever. And it is confuted by the con&s;olation now given them, in this very article: "In nothing terrified by your adver&s;aries; which is to them an evident token of perdition," (which &s;hall devour the adver&s;aries, Heb. 10.27.) "but to you of &s;alvation, and that of God," Phil. 1.28. &s;o 2 The&s;. 1.6, 7, 9 ver&s;es, "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recom|pen&s;e tribulation to them that trouble you," "and to you who are troubled re&s;t with us." How is it effected? we are taught ver. 9th, "when they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with an everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, from that bli&s;sful pre&s;ence of the Lord; which the righteous &s;hall eternally enjoy." From all which, it &s;eems very evident, that the millennium in this prophecy, can upon no &s;cheme be after the general judgment. For, no &s;uch enemies as gog and magog, can ever &s;o mole&s;t and terrify the &s;aints of God, with their "formidable attempts and appearance" after that day. We have already noticed the incon&s;i&s;tency of the &s;cheme of the&s;e rebels. When they died in that next &s;tate, they ought to have quitted that world, and to have been tran&s;muted into &s;ome other. But there they rove, attempt mi&s;chief, and are killed the third time. Now &s;urely, they mu&s;t be tran&s;muted. No, after this de&s;truction by fire, upon the allowed con&s;truction of ver&s;e 10th, p. 294. they are ca&s;t into the lake of fire to be
<PB N="253" REF="019737_0272_0FACA811624986E0">
tormented for ever and ever: after the third death, it &s;eems, they are in the &s;ame world and place to which they were con|&s;igned before the &s;econd death; upon which, they had no more concern with it than the dead have with this living world.&mdash; Here is contradiction upon contradiction, one part of the &s;cheme oppo&s;ing and de&s;troying the other: and this gog and magog who are brought up, as friends, to &s;upport the &s;cheme, are &s;uch outrageous rebels again&s;t its laws of death and tran&s;mutation, as in fact to da&s;h the whole into ruins. Moreover, the &s;cheme is &s;elf-&s;ubverted and de&s;troyed another way. The apo&s;tle has fixed it as explicitly as po&s;&s;ible "that death is the la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed." This means, &s;ays this author, the &s;e|cond death:" and tells us, p. 215, 216. "now the &s;econd death can be de&s;troyed no way what&s;oever, but by putting an end to its power over tho&s;e, who are the &s;ubjects of it." But upon this &s;cheme, this &s;econd death and la&s;t enemy may be de&s;troyed and reign no more; and yet &s;in not be de&s;troyed, nor the wicked ever have a re&s;urrection to reign in life. For when the &s;tubborn wicked have died the &s;econd death, and are quickened and tran&s;muted into the fir&s;t of ages; the &s;econd hath &s;pent its whole force, and is ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed: it can never reign over them again, any more than the fir&s;t death can, after the general re&s;ur|rection: yet, &s;in is not de&s;troyed, they are &s;tubborn &s;till, and under the reign of the third death. And upon this plan, they may be under the fourth, fifth and fiftieth. Infallably they can never be &s;aved, becau&s;e &s;in can never be de&s;troyed in them. The la&s;t enemy that ever will be de&s;troyed, he &s;ays, is the &s;e|cond death: this is de&s;troyed in the fir&s;t quickening and tran&s;|mutation; yet they are under the power of &s;in. Now a man mu&s;t be lo&s;t in natural arithmetick, to &s;ay, the third, fourth, fifth or fiftieth, is the "&s;econd." Their whole &s;cheme then, is &s;elf-&s;ubverted and de&s;troyed, and all their hopes built upon it, are buried in its ruins. Surely, a man, who will not receive conviction and quit an error, when mathematically demon&s;tra|ted, &s;o that he mu&s;t give up his natural arithmetick and the di&s;|tinction of numbers, to retain it, is, irrecoverable by argumen|tation. This de&s;truction of it, is ab&s;olutely unavoidable: for this pleaded &s;econd death, mu&s;t be maintained, to void the argument from the la&s;t &s;entence, and confirm the doctrine of a
<PB N="254" REF="019737_0273_0FACA812215CF460">
next limited &s;tate; to evade the argument from "the worm that dieth not," &amp;c. Mark 9. And the quickening and re&s;urrec|tion from it, mu&s;t be maintained, to &s;upport the doctrine of tran&s;mutation, which becomes nece&s;&s;ary, to avoid the argu|ment, from their being tormented day and night forever and ever, Rev. 20.10. Now, it is infallible, "that death is the la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed," and the &s;cripture teaches but two deaths, the fir&s;t and &s;econd, take which of them they will, (this author takes the &s;econd) the wicked, that are not recovered and &s;aved, when that is de&s;troyed in their quickening from it, can never be &s;aved: for after this la&s;t enemy is de&s;troy|ed, all hopes of the de&s;truction of &s;in in their &s;en&s;e, and con&s;e|quently of &s;alvation, are plainly, ab&s;olutely and finally excluded and de&s;troyed. The like embarra&s;&s;ment, from &s;cripture or rea&s;on, or both, attends all other parts of this &s;cheme. The doctrine of di&s;cipline applied to the future &s;tate, hath been re|futed, and &s;hewn to be attended with &s;uch gro&s;s ab&s;urdities, as can never be admitted. The doctrine of purgatory, and of hell as a purging fire, to prepare the wicked for the heavenly inhe|ritance, is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruptions in all corrupt religion. It is to be abhorred and dete&s;ted by all men, for the "impiety" and "ab&s;urdity" of it. For the impiety of it: for to a&s;cribe that moral, divine change that meetens men for heaven, to the operations of future torment, which every where in &s;cripture is a&s;cribed to the Spirit of Grace, is gro&s;s impiety. It is not pre|tended, that the Spirit of Grace is given to the wicked, there: and if it was, the &s;cripture confutes it. Again, to a&s;cribe &s;uch an omnipotency to this future torment, as to divinely change and &s;anctify all the wicked, when abandoned as accur&s;ed, to utter ruin; is as abhorrent to our rational and moral &s;en&s;e and feelings, as the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is to our natural &s;en&s;es: and it is alike, a mon&s;ter of ab&s;urdity. The &s;ceptical doctrine, of "wi&s;e, rational, more effectual means to be u&s;ed for their recovery," is confuted by the go&s;pel con&s;titution&mdash; by the doctrine of retribution&mdash;by the parable of dives, and by the repeated declarations of our Lord "that they &s;hall be ca&s;t out of his kingdom," from the grace, privileges and means of it. And we have &s;hewn in another place, that by &s;cripture, all hopes are excluded, and every way of e&s;cape is barred, to
<PB N="255" REF="019737_0274_0FACA812E160B938">
tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins. To &s;ay the door of mercy is open to them, is to contradict our Saviour, who &s;aith it is &s;hut. And to &s;ay they are re&s;erved for the great ble&s;&s;ing of life "to reign in life for ever," is in the face of the la&s;t &s;entence, which dooms them as "accur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire and puni&s;hment. And to name no more, to &s;ay that our Lord reigns over them in a di&s;pen&s;ation "of darkne&s;s," "outer darkne&s;s," and "the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever" for the &s;ame purpo&s;e that he now reigns in a glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of light in this world, viz. "to enlighten, &s;anctify and &s;ave men; is &s;uch a mon&s;ter in &s;uppo&s;i|tion, as one would think no man could admit, unle&s;s his mind was &s;o blinded in this in&s;tance, as to &s;ubdue his rea&s;on and mental feelings, to in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>What further proof can be requi&s;ite, to demoli&s;h this &s;cheme utterly, to remove all &s;ceptic doubt, and &s;et the&s;e gentlemen down &s;atisfied in the common chri&s;tian faith? Will it be effec|tual to prove (1.) that go&s;pel promi&s;es, are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance, in the kingdom of our heavenly Father? (2dly.) that the&s;e promi&s;es and this inheritance hath been the great object of the faith and hope of good men in all ages, with a hope which cannot di&s;appoint them? and (3dly.) that in the great day of the re&s;urrection and la&s;t judgment, they will in fact be put in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this inheritance, in that glo|rious kingdom? and la&s;tly, that when the righteous are tran&s;|lated out of Chri&s;t's kingdom, into the kingdom of their hea|venly Father (the kingdom being given up to him) that then the wicked &s;hall be &s;hut out of this kingdom and have no in|heritance in it? All this I &s;hould think, mu&s;t fully &s;atisfy every candid, impartial mind: if we make full proof of it, I can &s;ee nothing wanting. Wherefore I would proceed to &s;hew (1.) go&s;pel promi&s;es are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance in the kingdom of our heavenly father. Mo&s;t readers perhaps may judge this too evident to need proof: and truly, the &s;cripture &s;o abounds with the&s;e great and precious promi&s;es, that I did not expect the&s;e two fir&s;t propo&s;itions would have been di&s;pu|ted. But we are told "that the reward promi&s;ed under the ad|mini&s;tration of Chri&s;t's kingdom in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, in order to per&s;uade men to be his good and faithful &s;ubjects, is not the final happine&s;s God intends to be&s;tow upon them; but the hap|pine&s;s

of that &s;tate which intervenes between the re&s;urrection and God's being all in all," p. 222. In like manner it is &s;aid of go&s;pel threatnings, "that they point out the mi&s;ery of this intermediate &s;tate, and not mi&s;ery that will have no end," p. 223. To clear this point; I would note &s;ome things more generally, to enable any attentive reader to recollect the&s;e precious pro|mi&s;es, in plenty, and then particularize &s;ome in&s;tances of proof. It may be noted, that the great &s;alvation of Chri&s;t in the future world, certainly includes the heavenly inheritance; &s;o that all the promi&s;es of this &s;alvation, are promi&s;es of this inheritance. "Chri&s;t is the author of eternal &s;alvation, to all that obey him:" this &s;alvation certainly includes the heavenly inheritance. The go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion carries this glorious promi&s;e in the face of it. So all the declarations of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, "he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved," &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life&mdash;"believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved," &amp;c. are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance; and the contrary threat|nings to final unbelievers, are threatnings of di&s;heri&s;on and ex|clu&s;ion from that inheritance: and the&s;e are numerous in the go&s;pel, acts, &amp;c. It may al&s;o be noted, all the promi&s;es of "heaven" "the kingdom of God," "the kingdom of heaven," and "of the father," at and after the future judgment, are pro|mi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance. "Ye &s;hall have trea&s;ures in heaven," "great &s;hall be your reward in heaven," "it is the Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom," "ye &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;un in the kingdom of your Father," &amp;c. are all promi&s;es of that &s;ort. The &s;ame may be noted of all the pro|mi&s;es of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s made to that "&s;aith whereby the ju&s;t do live," and "to that repentance which is unto life, and to &s;alvation;" they are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance, and are numerous in the old te&s;tament and new. So are the pro|mi&s;es of &s;eeing God&mdash;that he will be their God, and exceeding great reward&mdash;and that great go&s;pel promi&s;e "he will be their God and they &s;hall be his people, his &s;ons and daughters." As Paul teaches us to argue from the grant of adoption, "if chil|dren, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t," Rom. 8.17. Heirs of what? why of that glorious kingdom when "God is all in all," for Chri&s;t is more than heir, he is Lord of his own kingdom. The&s;e general references might be
<PB N="257" REF="019737_0276_0FACA814943FF5C0">
thought &s;ufficient; but to put it out of di&s;pute, we will particu|larize further proof. We know <Q>that Chri&s;t hath obtained eternal redemption, and is a mediator to this end, that the called (according to God's purpo&s;e) might receive the promi&s;e of eternal inheritance,</Q> Heb. 9.12, 15. They certainly then, do receive this promi&s;e. God hath prepared for them a city and kingdom in heaven, and "they are now come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly (not earthly) Jeru&s;a|lem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born which are written in hea|ven, (not in the new earth) and to God the judge of all," &amp;c. Heb. 12.22, 23. How are they come to all this? not in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion) but by promi&s;e. And "now receive a kingdom which cannot be moved, v. 28th. How do they receive it? There is but two ways, the one by promi&s;e, the other by, or in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is by promi&s;e only, they now receive this king|dom. What kingdom is this? not his re&s;urrection kingdom, for that we are told will be moved and given up. It is that kingdom then, wherein "God is all in all" which cannot be moved, which they now in fact, receive by promi&s;e. St. Peter teaches the &s;ame, "that they are begotten again "to a lively hope,"&mdash;"to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and which fadeth not away, re&s;erved (not in the new earth) but in heaven for them. For who? not all the lap&s;ed &s;ons of Adam, but tho&s;e "who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto &s;alvation, ready to be revealed in the la&s;t time," the la&s;t day, the end of time, 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. And what doth this lively hope &s;tand upon, but the promi&s;e of God? for, every hope of this inheritance not founded on a divine promi&s;e, is pre&s;umptuous and vain. He al&s;o gives the promi&s;e of an in|corruptible crown, to be received at the appearance of Chri&s;t, in the great day, 1 Pet. 5.4. St. John is expre&s;s in point. "This is the promi&s;e that he hath promi&s;ed us, even eternal life," 1 John 2.26. Our Saviour gave this promi&s;e, and ever|la&s;ting con&s;olation to his di&s;ciples, at parting. "Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me: in my Father's hou&s;e (heaven) are many man&s;ions; if it were not &s;o I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you: and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
<PB N="258" REF="019737_0277_0FACA81522B6BBE8">
receive you unto my&s;elf, that where I am ye may be al&s;o." John 14.1, 2, 3. At his &s;econd coming he will receive them into this heavenly inheritance. So they undoubtedly under|&s;tood him; and he without doubt intended it, in this gracious promi&s;e. Neither, doth the fulfilment of the&s;e precious pro|mi&s;es &s;u&s;pend and re&s;t upon the will, power or vertue of the abandoned part of the creation; but upon the oath and immu|tability of God, as the apo&s;tle teacheth, Heb. 6.17, 18, 19 &amp; 20th ver&s;es. "Wherein God willing more abundantly to &s;hew unto the heirs of promi&s;e the immutability of his coun&s;el, con|firmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie, they might have &s;trong con&s;o|lation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the &s;oul, &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t, and which entereth into that within the vail, whi|ther the forerunner is for us entered, even Je&s;us, made an high prie&s;t forever after the order of Melchi&s;edec." The&s;e promi|&s;es &s;o confirmed, are not made to all men, but to tho&s;e who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us. They are not promi&s;es of an inheritance in a new heavens and earth; Chri&s;t hath not entered a forerunner there&mdash;they have no exi&s;tence: but they are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance. For their faith and hope founded on them, as an anchor of the &s;oul enters within the vail, into heaven it&s;elf, where Chri&s;t their forerunner hath entered, to take the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in their behalf, and to in&s;ure their actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the great day ap|pointed for it. Thus clear and numerous are the go&s;pel pro|mi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance, announced by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, to convert &s;inful men to God, to e&s;tabli&s;h and comfort believers, and "to make them good and faithful &s;ub|jects to Chri&s;t." This fir&s;t point being clear beyond di&s;pute or doubt, I proceed to &s;hew (2dly&punc;) that an&s;werable to the great de&s;ign of them, the&s;e promi&s;es and this inheritance hath been the great object of the faith and hope of good men in all ages, and with a hope which cannot di&s;appoint them. This is con&s;tructively conceded in their famous note, p. 253, and need|eth not to be laboured. Paul proves it, by that cloud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> witne&s;&s;es and heroes of faith, who lived before the coming of Chri&s;t, produced by him in Heb. 11th chapter, who were all

looking for and de&s;iring a heavenly city and country (not a new earth one) "prepared for them of God," and lived and died in the faith and hope of it, by embracing the promi&s;es. Our Saviour teaches and urges it the duty of all, "to lay up their trea&s;ures in heaven," not on the earth, new or old; "to &s;eek fir&s;t the ble&s;&s;ings of the kingdom of God," "to labour for the meat that endureth to everla&s;ting life," and not for ages in the new earth. And St. Paul exhorts chri&s;tians "to &s;eek the things that are above, where God and Chri&s;t are," and "to fee their affections on things above, and not on things on earth," new or old: and animates them to it, with the hope "that when Chri&s;t who is their life &s;hall appear, they al&s;o &s;hall then appear with him in glory," Col. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. And he exhibits the&s;e great objects of the chri&s;tian faith and hope, not only as the objects by which chri&s;tians ought to be, but are in fact in|fluenced and governed in their labours and &s;ufferings in this world. 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. and ch. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. "For which cau&s;e we faint not, but though our outward man peri&s;h, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; (here this author admits eternal in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e) while we look not at the things which are &s;een, but at the things which are not &s;een: for the things which are &s;een are temporal; but the things which are not &s;een are eternal. For we know, that if our earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." (Not the new earth). "For in this we groan earne&s;tly, de&s;iring to be cloathed upon with our hou&s;e which is from heaven: if &s;o be that being cloathed, we &s;hall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burthened: not for that we would be uncloath|ed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be &s;wallowed up of life," The connexion &s;hews that at the time when mortality is &s;wallowed up of life, then they &s;hall be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their hou&s;e and inheritance which is eternal in the heavens. Nor can they po&s;&s;ibly fail of it for the rea&s;on added. "Now he that hath wrought us for the &s;elf-&s;ame thing," (this faith, hope and meetne&s;s for it) "is God" (who will certainly com|pleat this whole work) "who al&s;o hath given unto us the earne&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="019737_0279_0FACA816A093FB28">
of the Spirit:" to in&s;ure their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this heavenly inhe|ritance in that appointed time, of the re&s;urrection. And in the following ver&s;es he goes on to &s;hew how they lived and were governed by the&s;e great objects of the chri&s;tian faith and hope. And "the &s;aving grace of God teaches chri&s;tians to be looking for this ble&s;&s;ed hope, at the appearing of the great God our Sa|viour," Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. This was &s;o notoriou&s;ly the com|mon faith of all chri&s;tians in that day and age, that the apo&s;tle appeals upon it, to per&s;ecuted chri&s;tians, in the&s;e words, "Knowing in your&s;elves that ye have in heaven (not on earth, new or old) a better and an enduring &s;ub&s;tance," Heb. 10.34. and exhorts them in the next ver&s;e, "not to ca&s;t away their confidence, which hath great recompence of reward." And in the la&s;t ver&s;e tells them it is "the &s;alvation of the &s;oul." This point cannot labour with any one, who attends to the governing faith and &s;pirit of the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;ti|ans. I will only add, they cannot be di&s;appointed in this hope. "It is a hope that maketh not a&s;hamed," Rom. 5.5. and it is promi&s;ed, "they &s;hall never be confounded." Principally, becau&s;e, as the promi&s;es are founded on the truth and immu|tability of God; &s;o the time of their fulfilment is infallibly fixed and a&s;certained: &s;o that nothing might be wanting to &s;upport "the great con&s;olation of the heirs of the&s;e promi&s;es." Our Saviour and his apo&s;tles have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the time of their ful|filment to the great re&s;urrection and judgment day. So that the faith and hopes of all good men in all ages (unle&s;s a few univer&s;ali&s;ts be counted an exception) will &s;uffer an amazing di&s;appointment, if they are not put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly inheritance, they have been looking, waiting, hoping for, in that day. It is impo&s;&s;ible, for (3dly.) it is certain, that in the great re&s;urrection and judgment day, they will be put into this inheritance, in that glorious kingdom. The evidence of this, I &s;hould think, is as clear and &s;trong, as can be wi&s;hed. All the prophets, from Enoch to St. John, point us to it, as the great day of retribution, and of rendering the rewards and pu|ni&s;hments of the invi&s;ible and eternal world: and there is not a hint in revelation of any other retribution, after this. Our Saviour's motto is, "Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work &s;hall be,"
<PB N="261" REF="019737_0280_0FACA8177306DDC0">
Rev. 22.12. to render to every one the full reward, either of the promi&s;e or threatning. In his parables of the net&mdash;of the &s;ower&mdash;of the pounds and talents he a&s;&s;ures us at the end of the world, he will execute his promi&s;es and threatnings in the recompences of the invi&s;ible world, to the faithful and to the wicked. And in the 25th of Matthew he gives us the proce&s;s of the future judgment, and of the final everla&s;ting &s;entences to the one and the other. The great doctrine of ju&s;tification a&s;|&s;ure us, the ju&s;tified will then be &s;aved from the wrath to come, and be in&s;tated immediately, in eternal life. And our Lord hath promi&s;ed the good &s;hall be rewarded in the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t, Luke 14.14. no doubt with the promi&s;ed rewards in heaven. He repeatedly promi&s;es to them that believe "ever|la&s;ting life, and that he will rai&s;e them up at the la&s;t day." To what? undoubtedly to the inheritance of this eternal life, with which he connects the promi&s;e. Accordingly, Dr. Taylor &s;ays, "that the revival and re&s;urrection of the body is frequently put for our advancement to eternal life."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note on Rom. 8.11.</NOTE> At his coming again he will receive his faithful di&s;ciples to the men&s;ions prepared for them in heaven, according to promi&s;e, John 14.1, 2, 3. And St. Paul makes their re&s;urrection, when death is &s;wallow|ed up in victory, coincident in time, with their receiving their hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, as before noted, 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4. St. Peter teaches, his &s;econd coming will be for the final regulation of all things, &s;poken by all the prophets, Acts 3.21. Certainly then he will fulfil all the pro|mi&s;es and threatnings relating to the future and invi&s;ible world. And con&s;equently, will put the &s;aints into their final and eternal promi&s;ed inheritance. Accordingly this &s;ame apo&s;tle tells us, this "incorruptible inheritance is now re&s;erved in heaven" for tho&s;e "who are kept by the power of God through faith unto &s;alvation, ready to be revealed in the la&s;t time"&mdash;the la&s;t day when time &s;hall be no more&mdash;"at the appearance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," when they &s;hall receive the end of faith, the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls: "the grace to be brought to them at the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," 1 Pet. 1.4, 5, 7 and 13th; and he is as expli|cit as can be, "that faithful under &s;hephards &s;hall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away," "when the chief &s;hep|hard &s;hall appear," and not at the end of ages of ages, after the

future judgment, 1 Pet. 5.4. St. Jude teaches chri&s;tians "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> keep them&s;elves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t (at his coming) unto eternal life," Jude 21. St. Paul is very expre&s;s "that Chri&s;t will appear the &s;e|cond time unto &s;alvation," Heb. 9.28. and chri&s;tians are to be "looking for this ble&s;&s;ed. hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t," to compleat it at his coming, Tit. 2.13. For in that day they &s;hall be put into their promi&s;ed heavenly re&s;t: "re&s;t with us," &s;aith the apo&s;tle, 2 The&s;. 1.7. "In that day" "all that love his appear|ing &s;hall receive their crown, connected with their inheritance, 2 Tim. 3.8. and to pa&s;s &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages which confirm it. I would ob&s;erve, in addition to all the&s;e declarations and promi&s;es of their being put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heavenly inheritance in that day&mdash;they have now the in&s;uring &s;eal and pledge of it, in the &s;pirit of promi&s;e given to, and received by them, which confirms it with the greate&s;t certainty. We read once and again of chri&s;tians receiving "the &s;pirit of promi&s;e," "the &s;eal and earne&s;t of the Spirit," and are &s;aid to be "&s;ealed to the day of redemption," (i.e.) until they are compleatly re|deemed and put into their final inheritance. We have adduced one, 2 Cor. 5.5. under the foregoing head. I will adduce but one pa&s;&s;age more to prove by this medium they will certainly be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in that day, viz. tho&s;e words, "in whom after ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with that holy Spirit of pro|mi&s;e, which is the earne&s;t of our inheritance, until the redemp|tion of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion," Eph. 1.13, 14 ver&s;es. This author admits "this inheritance." to be "the incurruptible, heavenly and eternal inheritance." And that the redemption here intended, is, the redemption and re&s;urrection of the body, in the glorious "adoption of the &s;ons of God," Rom. 8.23. p. 150, 3, 4; and the argument to our purpo&s;e, &s;eems very ea&s;y, clear and &s;trong. The Spirit of promi&s;e is given to believers, as the earne&s;t and in&s;uring pledge of their being put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this heavenly inheritance "at the appointed time:" "this time" is given and noted, the redemption of their bodies and glorious adoption in the great re&s;urrection and judgment day: the pledge and earne&s;t to an&s;wer the intention of it, will continue until they are actually put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but the
<PB N="263" REF="019737_0282_0FACA818E16C3A88">
pledge is only unto this redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and therefore they will infallibly be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this inheritance, in that glorious day. This is of &s;uch weight, that with me it would be &s;ufficient, if there were no futher confir|mation. But we &s;ee the whole tenor of &s;cripture teaches the &s;ame thing. And this author him&s;elf teaches, "the faithful &s;ervants of God will be immediately in&s;tated in eternal life, upon their re&s;urrection in the great day," p. 90. No one will di&s;pute he means eternal, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e. And from this &s;ingle point, their doctrine of the millennium is confuted and ab&s;olutely excluded. It is not po&s;&s;ible to be avoided by a pretence, that although they are "in&s;tated in eternal life," yet the enjoyment of that inheritance may be deferred, till after the millennium and tho&s;e ages are ended. For it is an ab&s;urd con|tradiction&punc; it amounts to this, "that they are put in and yet kept out of their inheritance at the &s;ame time," and becau&s;e all the&s;e forecited &s;criptures, and many others witne&s;s again&s;t it, and for another clear deci&s;ive rea&s;on, which I &s;hall proceed to illu&s;trate, viz. "becau&s;e our Saviour expre&s;sly con&s;igns them to this in|heritance in the kingdom of their heavenly Father, in that great day." The&s;e are his words, "then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right-hand, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world," Mat. 25.34. This cannot be the new earth re&s;urrection king|dom, they tell of, for that is prepared at or after the judgment; but, by this &s;entence, they are introduced to po&s;&s;e&s;s another kingdom "prepared for them before the foundation of the world." It is doubtle&s;s that kingdom they "now receive" by promi&s;e "which &s;hall never be moved," Heb. 12.28. And if we compare this &s;entence, with our Saviour's previous pro|mi&s;e to put them into the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their heavenly Fa|ther's kingdom, in that day: it &s;hould &s;eem it mu&s;t put it out of di&s;pute and doubt, in the chri&s;tian world. For he tells us, in the conclu&s;ion of the parable of the &s;ower, that when he &s;hall &s;ettle the kingdom in the judgment day; then (at that very time) &s;hall the righteous &s;hine forth as the &s;un, in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear it." Mat. 13.43. The kingdom is then changed. The final &s;entence introduces the righteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the heavenly inheritance; and
<PB N="264" REF="019737_0283_0FACA819A0CB2828">
with it, they are tran&s;lated out of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, into the kingdom of their Father, to &s;hine as the &s;un in that king|dom in which "God is all in all." The kingdom is given up in that day, when they are put into actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to "inherit" the everla&s;ting kingdom of their Father. Where then is the new earth, millennium re&s;urrection kingdom? it is ab&s;olutely excluded. By what authority? the highe&s;t in heaven and earth, the &s;upreme Judge of all worlds. And let it be bani&s;hed the chri&s;tian world forever, to be no more a &s;tumbling-block in it.</P>
<P>It remains to be &s;hewn la&s;tly, That at that very time, when the righteous are tran&s;lated out of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, into the glorious kingdom of their Father, and the Son in fact gives up the kingdom to the Father; the wicked &s;hall be &s;hut out of that kingdom, and have no inheritance in it. And the words of our Lord are full and expre&s;s in point: "So &s;hall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man &s;hall &s;end forth his an|gels, and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity; and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire; there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth. Then (at that &s;ame time) &s;hall the righteous &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear it," Mat. 13.40, 41, 42, 43. It &s;eems very evident from the&s;e words, that Chri&s;t will reign no longer&mdash;and that this &s;et|tlement of his kingdom is final and for eternity: for all his good &s;ubjects are introduced "to inherit" the kingdom of the Father. And when caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and conducted by him into the everla&s;ting man&s;ions of glory in this kingdom, after judgment, the kingdom is compleatly given up: and it is at this time all the wicked are ca&s;t out, and con&s;igned to their future puni&s;hment. And all his parables upon this awful &s;ubject, are expre&s;s in their being ca&s;t out at that period. And &s;o is the exhibition of the &s;entences of the la&s;t judgment, Mat. 25th; and when the righteous &s;hall go into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of eternal life in the kingdom of their Father, the wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, as in the la&s;t ver&s;e. And he gives us one more deci&s;ive evidence of it, where he repre&s;ents the di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy to be ended, and the door of mercy to be &s;hut, at that awful period. When he will &s;ay to the wick|ed, "depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, there &s;hall be

weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth, when ye &s;hall &s;ee Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you your&s;elves thru&s;t out." And they &s;hall come from the ea&s;t, and from the we&s;t, and from the north, and from the &s;outh and &s;hall &s;it down in the kingdom of God," Luk. 13.26, 27, 28, 29. It is mo&s;t plain, at that period, when all the righteous &s;hall be tran&s;lated into that kingdom of God, prepared for them before the foundation of the world, and &s;it down in the full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, as their eternal inheritance, and &s;hall &s;hine as the &s;un in it: then &s;hall all the wicked be thru&s;t out of it, accur&s;ed, devoted to mi&s;ery: for they cannot &s;ee them in that kingdom un|til they are actually put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: and this is the date of their final mi&s;ery. And St. Paul is clear, repeated, and expre&s;s in teaching the &s;ame doctrine, that "the wicked &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God," 1 Cor. 9.10. and Gal. 5.21, before cited. And what expre&s;&s;ions can be more &s;trong and pointed than tho&s;e, that "they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and of God" the Father, when the righteous &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in it? Eph. 5.5. Had this author found any texts, &s;o clear and deci&s;ive for his &s;cheme, he would have rung it in both our ears, "what a poor, lean, low con&s;truc|tion, the common con&s;truction, compared to his." As the re&s;ult of the whole, the following grand points &s;eem deci&s;ively clear, viz. "that the deci&s;ion of the la&s;t judgment is final and for eternity, both with re&s;pect to the righteous and wicked: that, at that period, the Son will give up the kingdom, and God will be all in all: that, Chri&s;t will reign no longer in the cha|racter and office of a Saviour and Judge: that their &s;cheme of an intermediate, millennium kingdom, between the final judg|ment and his giving up the kingdom, is a deluding fancy: that, the doctrine of retribution in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e, as oppo&s;ed to the idea of di&s;cipline is fully and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed: and the doct|rine of the final &s;alvation of all the finally di&s;obedient, upon every &s;cheme that hath been or can be advanced, is fully refuted and overthrown. This author admits (p. 8, 10, 11.) if the next &s;tate is final, as we have before &s;hewn and now more fully con|firmed, "that it is impo&s;&s;ible that all men &s;hould be finally &s;aved." But it will not follow, as is &s;ugge&s;ted, that we mu&s;t give a low &s;en&s;e "to Chri&s;t's reigning forever and ever:" for
<PB N="266" REF="019737_0285_0FACA81B20832E60">
he will be adored "as king of &s;aints forever," and as the divine "Logos," who was with God and was God before creation; he will reign jointly with the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t in that kingdom wherein "God is all in all," to eternity. The main point being fully proved and &s;ettled, "that the next &s;tate is final," we become agreed, "it is impo&s;&s;ible that all men &s;hould be finally &s;aved." I &s;hall clo&s;e this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, with this remark. It is evident, that our Saviour and his apo&s;tles not only taught the&s;e great articles of the chri&s;tian faith in their connexion, with great plainne&s;s, but al&s;o laboured to impre&s;s a near, lively, realizing and governing belief of the&s;e invi&s;ible and eternal things upon the hearts and con&s;ciences of men, as of the la&s;t importance to them, to induce them to believe, to live and walk by the faith of them, that they might be &s;aved: the&s;e were "the mighty weapons of their warfare." Now, if they were divinely taught of God, the mo&s;t wi&s;e and effectual way to deal with the hearts and con&s;ciences of men, to direct their views, to controul and &s;ubdue their pa&s;&s;ions, to form their choice, their tempers and effectual pur&s;uit of the ble&s;&s;ings of the king|dom of God, and to make them good men and chri&s;tians: the &s;en&s;ible reader will judge, whether the counter in&s;tructions, to unhinge and un&s;ettle the minds of men, and render them &s;cep|tical about tho&s;e great articles of the chri&s;tian faith; and doubt|ful, about the great and precious go&s;pel promi&s;es of the hea|venly inheritance, and withal to remove invi&s;ible and eternal things, at an almo&s;t immen&s;e di&s;tance, to &s;ome unknown period, ages of ages after the la&s;t judgment, be not of very pernicious con&s;equence to the great intere&s;t of the kingdom of God and to the &s;ouls of men: and he will ea&s;ily judge, from the &s;pirit and doctrines of the in&s;pired teachers, which of the two doctrines is the truth: and by the nature and tendency of them, which of the two &s;chemes is mo&s;t for the glory of God, for the honour of Chri&s;t, and is be&s;t fitted to promote the be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind in this world and world to come.</P>
<P>His clo&s;ing proof is, Gen. 3.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel." It is &s;aid, "by the &s;eed of the woman," Chri&s;t is principally in|tended; and by the brui&s;ing the &s;erpent's head, is &s;ignified his

compleat victory over the devil, under the emblem of a &s;erpent. Agreed. But how will he accompli&s;h this victory, is the que&s;|tion? he tells us "the words are an allu&s;ion to the way of kil|ling &s;erpents, by &s;triking at the head." We doubt it: "that it is expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame thing with killing a &s;erpent." Con&s;e|quently it means, "that he &s;hall de&s;troy the devil," not "his being," but "that kingdom of &s;in," which as a tempter he had introduced into the world, accompanied with "&s;orrow and death," p. 232, 3. To my under&s;tanding, this &s;tating is not clear; it &s;eems too loo&s;e: and ambiguous, by mixing things which come under a di&s;tinct, different con&s;truction. Sin is the di&s;|obedience and rebellion of the creature again&s;t God: but &s;or|row and death is the puni&s;hment of this iniquity, appointed, not by the tempter, but, by God the righteous governor and judge, in vindication of his own injured honour, authority and government, and for the be&s;t good of it. Therefore, the blen|ding &s;in, &s;orrow and death together, as one work and kingdom, according to the argumentative intention of the author, &s;eems confu&s;ion. The truth of fact, I take to be this: the devil was now &s;etting up his kingdom, in oppo&s;ition to that of the Mo&s;t High, by &s;educing his &s;ubjects; with de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the au|thority and moral government of God, and de&s;troy the whole world of mankind. Now, "the kingdom of &s;in" doth not to me, comprehend and convey the idea of this kingdom, clearly. And the de&s;ign of the promi&s;e, as explained by &s;ub&s;equent re|velation, I take to be this&mdash;that Chri&s;t &s;hould entirely de&s;troy the kingdom of the devil, as it is oppo&s;ed to the honour, au|thority and government of God, and de&s;igned for the &s;ubver&s;ion of it; and likewi&s;e defeat his de&s;ign to de&s;troy the whole hu|man race, by opening a way of &s;alvation to mankind, and &s;av|ing a glorious innumerable &s;eed out of them, and finally de&s;troy him and his inimical adhering &s;eed, in utter ruin. From the other &s;tating of this kingdom it is inferred, "this fir&s;t promi&s;e fairly leads us to look for the time, when &s;in &s;hall be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed by him who was born of a woman," and this is called the mo&s;t &s;imple con&s;truction of it, p. 234, 5. to me it appears the very rever&s;e. If &s;in, is the kingdom to be de|&s;troyed, and it &s;hall be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, then it &s;eems it will be de&s;troyed in the devil and his angels, and they
<PB N="268" REF="019737_0287_0FACA81CA1596A20">
&s;hall be &s;aved, as well as mankind. For if &s;in be a kingdom, it cannot be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, while there is any &s;in in the univer&s;e. And it concludes as &s;trongly for the &s;al|vation of the fallen angels, as the finally di&s;obedient of man|kind: and &s;o do &s;everal others of their arguments. If the happine&s;s of the creature be the ultimate end of the creation, and "if all enemies without exception &s;hall be &s;ubdued, and they cannot be &s;ubdued without de&s;troying their characters as rebels, and by their reduction to willing &s;ubjection to the au|thority of God," the&s;e with other arguments, conclude as forci|bly for the final happine&s;s of the devil and his angels, as the finally impenitent of mankind. And this I take to be their true &s;cheme, nor can they be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, without it. Will this text bear &s;uch a con&s;truction? The connexion with the foregoing ver&s;e &s;hews it announced, as a cur&s;e upon the devil and his inimical &s;eed; a cur&s;e of final remedilous de&s;truc|tion; like that of brui&s;ing a &s;erpent's head with an incurable, deadly wound. But in their con&s;truction, we are taught to read it, as a ble&s;&s;ing, and the highe&s;t that could be pronounced upon them. As a cur&s;e, it is written, "I will put enmity be|tween thee and the woman," but in their con&s;truction of the kingdom of &s;in totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, it mu&s;t be e|ternal friend&s;hip between them: as a cur&s;e it is written, "and between thy &s;eed and her &s;eed," "the &s;eed of evil doers," "the children of di&s;obedience in whom he reigns," "the generation of vipers," "the born after the fle&s;h who per&s;ecute them that are born after the &s;pirit," de&s;cribed in &s;cripture as his &s;eed, and Chri&s;t, and them that are his, his willing and obedient &s;ubjects; but in the other con&s;truction, in&s;tead of perpetual enmity, it is I will put away all enmity, between the two &s;eeds, and introduce an everla&s;ting reconciliation, harmony, healing and peace be|tween them. Again, the "brui&s;ing of the head" in the con|nexion of a cur&s;e, teaches the final overthrow of the devil, his inimical &s;eed and kingdom, in a remedilous de&s;truction: but if this "brui&s;ing" fall not upon "the being of the devil" and his inimical &s;eed, but upon the kingdom of &s;in, and de&s;troys it totally and ab&s;olutely; it &s;peeks to the devil and his &s;eed an e|ternal exemption from brui&s;ing and puni&s;hment: as another author expre&s;&s;es it, "by exterminating both natural and moral

evil, and introducing univer&s;al happine&s;s," "final, univer&s;al happine&s;s." Now can any text be more directly oppo&s;ed in the letter and &s;pirit of it, and be more effectually de&s;troyed by any expo&s;ition, than is effected in this text, in &s;uch a con&s;truction?<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The &s;en&s;e given to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;ome other texts, by the univer&s;ali&s;ts, hath repeatedly brought to my mind, a &s;mart turn given, by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll, afterwards ma&s;ter of the rolls, upon a con&s;truction of law given upon Dr. Sacheveril's trial: in the&s;e words, "mala expo&s;itio corrumpit textum; "a fal&s;e or bad expo&s;ition corrupts a text, but what a cur&s;ed expo&s;ition is that, (&s;ays he) which de&s;troys the text it&s;elf?"</NOTE> That "the brui&s;ing the head" &s;hould be an allu&s;ion to the cu&s;|tom and way of killing &s;erpents by &s;triking at the head, when there was no in&s;tance preceeding the &s;entence to allude to; and when the cu&s;tom owes its exi&s;tence to the enmity expre&s;&s;ed in the text; &s;eems unlikely. Whereas, there is not perhaps an object on earth, of greater natural horror and contempt to man|kind, than a vnenomous &s;erpent deeply and mortally wounded in the head, &s;o as to be utterly di&s;abled from hurting, and yet wreathing and agonizing in pain. A fit emblem to exhibit the impotent rage and everla&s;ting &s;hame and pain of final enemies to God. At any rate, the word "brui&s;ing" mu&s;t have a &s;im|ilar &s;en&s;e, when applied to the heel and head in the &s;ame &s;en|tence. Now we know the &s;eed of the woman, "the Me&s;&s;iah," was "brui&s;ed in the heel," in the way of reproach and &s;ufferings. Mu&s;t not the brui&s;ing of the head be likewi&s;e, in a way of di&s;|tingui&s;hed &s;ufferings to him and his inimical &s;eed, &s;ufferings, that are capital, final, without remedy and without end? Surely, the &s;ame word, cannot have an oppo&s;ite meaning, in the &s;ame &s;entence: in one part, mean reproach and &s;ufferings; and in the other part, un&s;peakably the greater "brui&s;ing," mean, an eternal exemption from reproach and &s;ufferings, in everla&s;ting peace and happine&s;s. This would be to confound language utterly, and render it impo&s;&s;ible to fix the meaning of words. Their con&s;truction then is impo&s;&s;ible to be true. It is to be noted, the promi&s;es and predictions of God, (and this text par|takes of both) are be&s;t under&s;tood in their eventual illu&s;tration. And indeed this is the only key where we can have it, by which we can have full &s;atisfaction of their meaning. Now, if we at|tend to the eventual illu&s;tration given by in&s;piration, the gen|eral meaning becomes clear and beyond doubt. The text
<PB N="270" REF="019737_0289_0FACA81E22446278">
doth indeed contain a promi&s;e of the adorable Me&s;&s;iah, that he &s;hall have a &s;eed and generation to &s;erve him more numerous than the &s;tars of heaven&mdash;that he will &s;et up his kingdom a|gain&s;t, to the &s;ubver&s;ion and overthrow of that of the wicked one&mdash;that it &s;hall prevail, become exceeding great and la&s;t forever&mdash;it &s;hall &s;pread over all the nations of the whole world, and innumerable multitudes out of all nations &s;hall be gathered into it, be re&s;cued from the power of &s;in and &s;atan, become his willing &s;ubjects, be made free by the Son of God, and be en|franchi&s;ed in the glorious liberties and happine&s;s of the children of God in this world, in heaven and eternity. That however there may and will be a &s;eed of the old &s;erpent, from Cain thro' many generations, of them that are born after the fle&s;h, who per&s;ecute them that are born after the Spirit, "a &s;eed of evil|doers and generation of vipers, children of di&s;obedience, in whom he reigns, as de&s;cribed in &s;acred record, who are led captive to do his will and &s;upport his kingdom; yet the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t, and followers of the Lamb &s;hall overcome all their &s;piritual enemies, through the blood, power and grace of the Lamb, (&s;atan &s;hall be brui&s;ed under their feet) and having &s;er|ved and &s;uffered with Chri&s;t, &s;hall al&s;o reign with him in eter|nal glory and triumph, in that kingdom of God, which will be eternally triumphant. And when Chri&s;t &s;hall have fully effec|ted his great de&s;igns in this world, and put his people in the compleat po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the great &s;alvation, he will then "brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent" with a mo&s;t tremendous capital puni&s;h|ment, de&s;troying his kingdom and con&s;igning the devil and his angels, and all his inimical &s;eed, who will not have Chri&s;t to rule over them; in the everla&s;ting fire, originally prepared for the devil and his angels. This in &s;ub&s;tance, is the expla|nation and illu&s;tration of this text as a promi&s;e and prediction, which is evidently exhibited, throughout the revelations of God. And it is &s;o far from teaching the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation, that the contrary doctrine is implicitly taught in the brui&s;ing in the text, for the puni&s;hment will certainly fall upon the inimical &s;eed, the workers of iniquity, as well as upon the devil and his angels. But it is objected, &s;in the work of the devil mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, or the Saviour hath not done his work; and how "in any propriety of &s;en&s;e, can it be de&s;troyed, while
<PB N="271" REF="019737_0290_0FACA81EE20C9D20">
millions live in enmity to God?" to which we reply: &s;in is in fact de&s;troyed, according to the meaning of this and other &s;criptures, in the manner already explained. It is totally and ab&s;olutely in all the redeemed and &s;aved. And as to its malig|nity again&s;t God, his government and good &s;ubjects, it is like|wi&s;e effectually de&s;troyed in them that peri&s;h. It can never operate di&s;honour to God, to his authority, laws and govern|ment; nor temptation or any injury to his good &s;ubjects; under an eternal puni&s;hment, according to its full de&s;ert. In this puni&s;hment, divine ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, holine&s;s illu&s;trared, the law is magnified, and the divine authority and government are as firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as though &s;in had never come into exi&s;t|ence. And &s;urely, it can operate no temptation to his good &s;ubjects, under &s;uch a full and eternal illu&s;tration of the infinite ill-demerit and malignity of it. And the con&s;igned to this puni&s;hment, are put under an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of giving any di&s;turbance to the divine government, or doing any injury to the good and happy &s;ubjects of it. So that as it is an object of divine governmental concern (principally regarded in the ap|pointment of Chri&s;t) it is ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed; and the Saviour has compleated his work, in ab&s;olute perfection and glory. As in the governments of this world, when a murderer is appre|hended, convicted, condemned and executed, by the hand of public ju&s;tice: law and ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, and authority and government are as firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the good &s;ubjects are as effectually &s;ecured, as though the murder had not been com|mitted. And in &s;cripture &s;tile, "the land is purged and clean from blood." But that it is the de&s;ign of God and a work a&s;&s;igned to the Saviour, totally and ab&s;olutely to de&s;troy &s;in and the puni&s;hment of it out of exi&s;tence, we certainly no where read in &s;cripture. Contrarywi&s;e, that &s;in will forever exi&s;t, not as tempter, or a plea&s;ure, but as a tormentor in whom it reigns, is abundantly taught us. That the wicked "&s;hall receive the fruit of their doings," "be filled with mi&s;chief," "with their own devices and their own ways," and that "their worm &s;hall never die," &amp;c. the&s;e things are as plainly taught, as words can teach them. It is likewi&s;e objected as inconceivable, how the devil's kingdom can be de&s;troyed, while millions in hell, re|taining their characters as rebels again&s;t God, remain the &s;ub|jects
<PB N="272" REF="019737_0291_0FACA81FA077DBF0">
of it. The whole force of the objection re&s;ts on this cir|cum&s;tance, a &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is but one way to de&s;troy it; which is a mi&s;take in fact. The objection &s;uppo&s;es, it can only be de&s;troyed by re&s;cuing the &s;ubjects of it from &s;in and mi&s;ery, and bringing them to &s;ubjection and &s;alvation, in God. So in fact it is de&s;troyed in re&s;pect to all the &s;anctified, redeem|ed and &s;aved out of this &s;inful world. But there is another way al&s;o, in which it is de&s;troyed, clearly taught us in divine revelation, wherein "the brui&s;ing the head" in this text, will have a final illu&s;tration and fulfilment. It is particularly poin|ted out Rev. 20. 10th and 15th, as hath been before explained. It &s;eems &s;elf-evident, his kingdom is in ab&s;olute ruin, when the devil and his angels and all workers of iniquity, are con&s;igned to the future puni&s;hment, and overwhelmed in ruin everla&s;ting. All rule, authority and power oppo&s;ing the kingdom of God and Chri&s;t, and upholding the devil's kingdom, are eternally put down. It is hell as will as death without order,&mdash;without &s;uperiority or inferiority among the wretched: all are reduced to a level, held and puni&s;hed as the criminals, of the divine ju&s;|tice. Ju&s;t as a kingdom or province in rebellion may be redu|ced by their willing &s;ubjection, or by force of arms and ju&s;tice. The whole may be captivated, reduced and impri&s;oned; the king, princes, nobles and &s;ubjects, all in one &s;tate of condemna|tion and puni&s;hment. The victory is compleat: all authority, power and rule which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the rebellion is put down; and all without di&s;tinction upon a level in puni&s;hment. The kingdom is, as totally in ruin, in this la&s;t way, as in that of wil|ling &s;ubjection. As to the reduced, in the one way and the other, there is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential difference: but none as to the de&s;truction and extinction of the kingdom it&s;elf. Both ways of de&s;troying the kingdom of the wicked one, are clearly and fully taught in &s;cripture; and the latter as clearly and fully as the former. In this view this text gives mo&s;t important in&s;truc|tion and warning to all men: it teacheth us to believe in the adorable Saviour here promi&s;ed and become his willing and o|bedient people, that we peri&s;h not, put have everla&s;ting life, in him. And it warns us to renounce the devil and all his works and ways, in a faithful &s;erving the living God: for if we conti|nue the &s;ervants of &s;in and &s;atan, the time is certainly coming,
<PB N="273" REF="019737_0292_0FACA8208B740990">
when this promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, will de&s;troy the devil's kingdom in an eternal de&s;truction, and in &s;uch a manner as to compleat the everla&s;ting ruin of him and all his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION VI. "The &s;cripture language, concerning the reduced or re&s;tored&punc; in con&s;equence of the mediatory inter|po&s;ition of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is &s;uch as to lead us into the thought that they are comprehen&s;ive of mankind univer&s;ally."</P>
<P>"There is one text he will venture to &s;ay is fully comprehen|&s;ive of this idea, that the redeemed by Chri&s;t are comprehen&s;ive of mankind univer&s;ally." It is Rev. 5.13. "And every crea|ture which is in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."</P>
<P>Upon which he argues, "the&s;e words evidently look forward to the completion of the &s;cheme of God with reference to man|kind, or to the time of God's being all in all; bringing in the &s;inle&s;s intelligences above, as uniting with the whole race of Adam, in giving the glory of their redemption to God, who contrived it, and to Chri&s;t that carried it into execution." "And that mankind univer&s;ally are the per&s;ons &s;inging this hymn of prai&s;e, in concert with the holy angels, he &s;ays, is evident from the enumeration here made, which is in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive terms:" "for it is the creatures in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the &s;eas, and all things in them." And adds, "the whole human kind are found in the places &s;pecified, and the &s;pecification of the places which contains them all, is a &s;ure argument he intended to comprehend them all." And he quotes the de&s;cription in the 20th chapter as parallel to confirm it. "And I &s;aw the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God," that is Chri&s;t the Judge, v. 12. "and the &s;ea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered the dead which were in them," v. 13. He adds, the creatures &s;poken of in the 5th chapter as under the earth, are tho&s;e very ones, of whom it is &s;aid in this place "death and hell gave up the dead in them," (the text doth not &s;ay &s;o, it is without any proof) and "the creatures in the &s;ea" he &s;ays, "are the dead that the &s;ea is here &s;aid to give up," (all without proof) whence he concludes, as the enumeration of creatures in the 5th, is more particular and
<PB N="274" REF="019737_0293_0FACA8215076D800">
&s;tronger than "of the dead" in the 20th, mankind univer&s;ally mu&s;t be comprehended in it." The more natural inference is, the apo&s;tle doth not mean the &s;ame creatures preci&s;ely in the two de&s;criptions. "He is pretty confident, no other &s;en&s;e can be given of this text, allowing the words their due natural force and a con&s;i&s;tent meaning," p. 238, 9, 40, 41. To me it is clear, this con&s;truction cannot be &s;upported by any ju&s;t, known rule of expo&s;ition whatever. He takes for granted the text looks forward to the time when the &s;cheme of God will be compleated, and he will be all in all. If allowed, this cannot help him: for we have proved this will take place at the period of the la&s;t judgment when the wicked will be excluded &s;alvation, and con&s;equently, from taking part in this &s;ong. Be&s;ides, the text is immediately connected with "Chri&s;t's receiving the book and opening the &s;eals" to unfold the grand &s;cenes of providence to take place, to the future judgment, when the wicked, &s;o far from joining with the redeemed in the celebration of this divine &s;ong, "&s;hall be ca&s;t into the lake of fire," Rev. 20.15. Again, he takes for granted, that "every creature" in this text, means mankind, them only, and univer&s;ally; without any &s;upport from the text, the context and connexion; and when it is never &s;o u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament, as we have before &s;hewn; and when we have proved from 1 Tim. 4.4. this very phra&s;e is u&s;ed for the inferior part of the creation, only. He likewi&s;e takes for granted, this de&s;cription and that in the 20th chapter are parallel; whereas, it is clear they are not &s;o in expre&s;&s;ion or de&s;ign. The de&s;ign, in the 5th chapter is to illu&s;trate the glo|ries due and to be paid to God and Chri&s;t in his &s;tate of exalta|tion; not only for the benefits of his redemption, but for his &s;upreme powers of government, and the benefits of his divine admini&s;tration; of which every creature in all this lower crea|tion in earth and &s;eas partake, and therefore may all naturally and literally be taken in with mankind as &s;ub&s;erving his prai&s;e. But the 20th hath re&s;pect to the final judgment, and therefore to mankind only. And the de&s;cription of all the dead rai&s;ed in earth and &s;eas, "of all the dead &s;mall and great &s;tanding before God" is &s;o particular and appropriate to mankind, as cannot po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken. "Every creature" is not found, in this latter de&s;cription. To &s;ettle the meaning of the text, the words
<PB N="275" REF="019737_0294_0FACA821E0DD25A0">
mu&s;t be taken either literally or figuratively; in both ways I conceive his con&s;truction mu&s;t fail of &s;upport. If the de&s;crip|tion "&s;aying" be taken figuratively, "that his adorable admi|ni&s;tration opening upon the world, would be &s;o glorious and exten&s;ively beneficial, that all creatures in earth and &s;eas as well as mankind &s;hould partake of the benefits; and all in fact be made to &s;ub&s;erve the glory and prai&s;e of him that &s;its upon the throne and of the Lamb, in concert with the holy part of the creation: agreeable to other prophetick de&s;criptions "all thy works &s;hall prai&s;e thee, O Lord, and thy &s;aints &s;hall ble&s;s thee," P&s;a. 145.10. And as the idea of the glory of his admini&s;tration was taught the prophet I&s;aiah by the &s;eraphims, when he &s;aw Chri&s;t's glory; "the whole earth is full of his glory," I&s;a. 6.1, 2, 3. and John 12.41. If this be the true meaning of this text, as &s;eems mo&s;t probable, it takes away the whole ground of the other con&s;truction: and if the text be taken literally, and the word creature be limited to mankind and the prai&s;e be vocal only, for which no one hath any warrant, yet I conceive his con&s;truction mu&s;t fail: for the text had doubtle&s;s a literal ful|filment in the time of the vi&s;ion; or which is the &s;ame thing, in the &s;en&s;e intended, it was at that time true, in fact. The diction in the text &s;peaks it plainly. Con&s;equently, if it looks forward to another fulfilment, it will doubtle&s;s be of the &s;ame kind e&s;&s;en|tially. This is the general &s;cripture rule, where a twofold lit|eral accompli&s;hment is de&s;igned: of which the forecited in|&s;tance, Acts 11. is a deci&s;ive illu&s;tration. The future pouring out of the Spirit, will be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, and for the &s;ame grand purpo&s;e, of &s;anctifying and &s;aving men; as in that day. Now in the time of the vi&s;ion, there was none of the wicked rai&s;ed from the dead, out of the earth or &s;eas to join in this di|vine &s;ong; and we infer there never will be, in any future period. They are excluded the text. Again, if taken literally, all that are or ever will be in hell, are excluded. They are excluded in the diction in the text, which limits it to creature, in heaven, on earth, under the earth and in the &s;eas. Hell is left out of the de&s;cription: and there is not a text in &s;cripture, that extends the benefit of Chri&s;t's admini&s;tration to any, after they are &s;ent into that place of torment. Further, it &s;eems it cannot be ful|filled after the future judgment, in which the wicked will be
<PB N="276" REF="019737_0295_0FACA822A09EB928">
condemned; for then the earth and &s;eas will be burnt up, and be no more. And it &s;eems a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity to predicate &s;ight and hearing upon "creatures on earth, under the earth, and in the &s;eas," when in fact there is no earth, no &s;eas nor any crea|tures in them, to be &s;een. Con&s;equently, the condemned in that day mu&s;t be forever excluded a part in this divine &s;ong, by the literal de&s;cription in the text. And it is to be noted, it cannot be fulfilled in the new earth; for it is expre&s;sly in&s;erted in it, "there was no more &s;ea," Rev. 21.1. Upon the literal con&s;truction, this mu&s;t be taken literally. And as there is no &s;ea there for creatures to be in, the diction of the text excludes a fulfilment of it, there. Moreover, if the creature mu&s;t be li|mited to mankind, and the con&s;truction &s;trictly literal; it &s;eems the &s;ight and hearing mu&s;t be &s;o, likewi&s;e. And upon this &s;cheme, what a &s;trange &s;ight and hearing mu&s;t this be extended to &s;ee and hear creatures on the earth and under the earth and in the &s;eas, ages of ages after the future judgment; and as many ages, after there has had been in fact, no earth, nor &s;eas, nor creatures to be &s;een in them. Surely, this &s;ight and hearing mu&s;t be figurative with a witne&s;s: for it figures away the earth and &s;eas and creatures in them, the very foundation of the vi&s;ion it&s;elf: it is &s;uch a figure as is not to be found in revelation, nor in any of the good rhetoricions of this world. Now by all this, it &s;eems evident that his expo&s;ition which includes all the finally wicked in this de&s;cription, cannot be &s;upported, but is every way confuted, by the &s;trict, literal con&s;truction of the text.&mdash; Whereas, the &s;en&s;e we have given of it, is ea&s;y and important, and well comports with the de&s;ign of the prophecy. I will only add, &s;hould we admit the "creature" here, means rational creature only, it will not follow that it means the whole race of mankind; or more, than the holy and obedient part of it, only. For two rea&s;ons: one is, that it is common to find a greater licence in heightening de&s;criptions in poetic, hieroglypic and prophetic writings, than in tho&s;e that are didactic, narrative or argumentative: and we are not bound to the &s;ame &s;trict rule of literal con&s;truction, nor will they often bear it. And this limitation of it, to the holy part of the creation, will very well accord in the connexion of the vi&s;ion: for it is the holy ones in heaven, and elders from our world only, that are employed in
<PB N="277" REF="019737_0296_0FACA82361E3FAC8">
this glorious chorus, in the preceeding part. From whence it is rational to &s;uppo&s;e, this de&s;cription to be a prophetic repre|&s;entation of "every creature" of the &s;ame character, heavenly &s;pirit and temper, on earth and in the &s;eas, that in due time &s;hall be brought to bear a part in this divine &s;ong; and this, revelation very clearly teaches, will be the truth of fact. The other rea&s;on is, that it is agreeable to the &s;pirit of the prophetic writings, to u&s;e &s;uch a &s;trong manner of de&s;cription when the friends of God and his people, only, are intended. Of this we have a deci&s;ive example in the univer&s;al &s;ong of prai&s;e of all in heaven and earth in the de&s;truction of old Babylon, Jer. 51.48. "Then the heaven and the earth, and <HI>all that is therein,</HI> &s;hall &s;ing for Babylon: for the &s;poiler &s;hall come unto her, from the north, &s;aith the Lord." Now a man of ingenuity, who had a &s;cheme to &s;upport by it, would make it very plau&s;ible, that mankind univer&s;ally were concerned in this &s;ong. He would &s;ay, by "heaven and earth" are meant the intelligent inhabit|ants of both worlds; by earth is intended earth and &s;eas, as Col. 1.16; and by "all that is therein" is included and intended all that have ever lived, and died and been buried in earth and &s;eas, which comprehends all mankind. Whereas, what is in|tended by this &s;trong de&s;cription is the friends of God, of ju&s;tice and of the people of God, the jews who were to have deliver|ance by it. The many millions in the foregoing ages, who were gone off the &s;tage, could have no concern in it. The numerous Babylonians who were ruined by the judgment, mu&s;t certainly be excepted, notwith&s;tanding "the all that is therein:" they could not chant the &s;ong of their own de&s;truction again&s;t the force of &s;elf-love, the natural de&s;ire of life and good, and the mo&s;t deep-rooted affections of nature; the &s;uppo&s;ition, is the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity. Again, their va&s;tly numerous connexions, by affinity, commerce, friend&s;hip and the like, con&s;i&s;ting of many thou&s;ands, perhaps millions, mu&s;t be exempted and ex|cluded, on the &s;ame ground. Now I &s;ee not but the text in di&s;pute may ju&s;t as well have the &s;ame limited con&s;truction. The context clearly leads to it, and it is the &s;anctified in this world only &s;hall have part in the &s;alvation on which the &s;ong is &s;uppo&s;edly founded. "The every creature" as applied to all of that di&s;tinctive character, is highly proper. And it is full as
<PB N="278" REF="019737_0297_0FACA82420BE6A70">
ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e who peri&s;h from the &s;alvation of God, &s;hould bear a part in this divine &s;ong, as that tho&s;e who peri&s;hed in Babylon &s;hould take a part in that which was &s;ung on that occa&s;ion. Now either this, or the expo&s;ition we have before given, I apprehend, "will allow the words their natural due force, and a con&s;i&s;tent meaning."</P>
<P>We have now con&s;idered, and I hope fully an&s;wered all his principal proofs; but there are &s;everal other texts which he, and others in that &s;entiment, lay weight upon, which require our notice. Such as the predictions and promi&s;es to Abraham, Gen. 12.2, 3. "And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will ble&s;s thee, and make thy name great, and thou &s;halt be a ble&s;&s;ing. And I will ble&s;s them that ble&s;s thee, and cur&s;e him that cur&s;eth thee: and in thee &s;hall all the families of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." And chap. 18.18. "And all the nations of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him." And chap. 22.18. "In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." Chap. 15.5. "Look now toward heaven, and tell the &s;tars, if thou be able to number them: and he &s;aid unto him, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;eed be." Upon the&s;e texts, it is &s;aid, "that all nations and all the fami|lies of the earth" is naturally expre&s;&s;ive of all mankind; and &s;o u&s;ed in &s;cripture. That the words con&s;idered in them&s;elves, and much more in connexion with the other texts he hath pro|duced, very readily offer this &s;en&s;e: and that none other fully comes up to the number expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t:<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 241, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> and enquires, what con&s;truction can be more honourable? &amp;c. We reply, that which is true, and agreeable to fact. This de&s;cant we judge too &s;uperficial, to form a deci&s;ive or probable conclu&s;i|on upon. So likewi&s;e, is his general de&s;cant upon &s;imilar pro|phecies and promi&s;es, couched in general terms and &s;trong de|&s;criptions. He &s;ays, the partial events, to which they are ap|plied commonly, by no means come up to the full meaning of the &s;trong and exten&s;ively benevolent terms, in which they are expre&s;&s;ed, "and by &s;uch con&s;tructions, there is danger of expo|&s;ing the oracles of God to contempt," p. 251. And I find other writers lay great &s;tre&s;s upon the univer&s;al terms, "all the ends of the earth," "all people," "nations" "kingdoms" "all fle&s;h," &amp;c. in which the&s;e predictions are delivered. It may
<PB N="279" REF="019737_0298_0FACA824E1092F10">
not therefore be improper in this place, to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject generally, to remove the force of the&s;e arguments, at once. And it &s;eems the more proper and requi&s;ite, becau&s;e the&s;e others are chiefly &s;ummary repetitions, or more particular illu&s;trations of the&s;e grand predictions and promi&s;es made to Abraham; referring to the &s;ame grand de&s;ign and work of God. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject in two points of view, perhaps may &s;et it in a clear and convincing light. (1.) By &s;hewing, it is not the de&s;ign of the&s;e or any other texts of &s;cripture, to indicate and a&s;certain the preci&s;e number of mankind that &s;hall finally be &s;aved. (2dly.) That neither the&s;e or any other predictions will bear their con&s;truction, which is confuted by rea&s;on, &s;crip|ture and fact. In the fir&s;t place, it &s;eems evident, it is not the de&s;ign of revelation, to a&s;certain the numbers that &s;hall finally be &s;aved: it is a &s;ecret with God, which he hath never revealed. It is a curio&s;ity, could do us no good; and is wi&s;ely concealed from u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: the whole tenor of revelation teaches, it turns upon the characters formed by his grace in this world; and therefore cannot be known by men, only in the day of judgment, when the characters and &s;tates of all men will be di&s;clo&s;ed and finally &s;ettled. Had this been the de&s;ign of God, why a repetition of promi&s;es, which, in the expre&s;&s;ions and connexions of them by no means carry this &s;entiment in them? when one promi&s;e plainly expre&s;&s;ing all mankind, would have decided the matter? It is not given, and certainly was not de&s;igned. When the que&s;tion was moved to our Saviour, "Are there few that be &s;aved?" Luke 13.23. our Lord had the faire&s;t occa&s;ion in the world, to &s;ettle this matter deci&s;ively, by his own authority, as to the full extent of the plan of mercy and the preci&s;e numbers to be &s;aved. He hath not done it in their favour. Why not? If it was a fit object of revelation, why did not he, who taught the way of God perfectly, reveal it? If it is the very glory of the go&s;pel, how can we acquit him, as to wi&s;dom and faith|fulne&s;s, in not publi&s;hing it, upon &s;o inviting an occa&s;ion? Again, if taught of God, to Abraham, and to the church by Mo&s;es and the prophets, and was in fact a peculiar glory of their doctrine; why did not he, who embraced all occa&s;ions to ex|plain the doctrine of Mo&s;es and the prophets, at lea&s;t refer us to the&s;e promi&s;es to Abraham, as a deci&s;ion of the que&s;tion? an
<PB N="280" REF="019737_0299_0FACA758E1809960">
univer&s;ali&s;t would have done it; would have been glad of the occa&s;ion: for they do it without any occa&s;ion given. Our Sa|viour did it not, neither do the apo&s;tles (tho' often refering to them) once refer to them, in this view. Why did not our Lord do it? Was it becau&s;e "this doctrine that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, was unfit to be publi&s;hed to the world? If &s;o, it con|demns them of pre&s;umption and audacity, in adventuring to publi&s;h to the world, a doctrine, that the wi&s;dom of our Saviour judged unfit to be taught. Or was it becau&s;e, there is no truth in this doctrine? this appears the rea&s;on, in our Lord's reply: that all men will not be finally &s;aved, as is conceded, if the next &s;tate be final, as hath been proved. And doth not this condemn them, for deluding the world with gro&s;s error, under the garb of a glorious go&s;pel truth? It is evident in the reply of Chri&s;t, v. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. "that many will not &s;o &s;eek and &s;trive as to enter into life: that in the great day, all workers of iniquity will be con&s;igned to future mi&s;ery; and the door of divine mercy will be &s;hut again&s;t them, that they cannot be &s;aved. And it &s;eems evident from what hath been &s;aid, that the preci&s;e number that &s;hall be &s;aved is not an object of divine revelation; and that it cannot be de&s;igned in the&s;e promi&s;es, that all mankind &s;hould be the &s;ubjects of the ble&s;&s;ings promi|&s;ed; becau&s;e, the promi&s;es are never &s;o referred to and applied by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles upon the mo&s;t inviting occa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ons; as they certainly would have been, if this was their grand intention. Their con&s;truction is certainly, be&s;ide and again&s;t the intention of them. And this will be more clear, while we &s;hew &s;econdly, their con&s;truction is confuted by the concurrent te&s;timony of rea&s;on, &s;cripture and fact.&mdash;Rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e teaches us, if they are ble&s;&s;ed as families and nations, in Abraham and his &s;eed, it mu&s;t be during their exi&s;tence in fa|mily and national &s;tate: and therefore it cannot look back to the pre-exi&s;tent ungodly families and nations who had a long time peri&s;hed before, and in the flood, and in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gene|rations after it, to that period. For it &s;eems an impo&s;&s;ibility in nature, that they &s;hould be the &s;ubjects of this ble&s;&s;ing accord|ing to the diction of the text, that is, "be ble&s;&s;ed as families and nations;" when they then had not, nor ever would have exi&s;tence more, in family and national &s;tate. And be&s;ides,
<PB N="281" REF="019737_0300_0FACA759B1F89270">
predictions never look backwards, it is again&s;t the nature of them, they always look forward to &s;ome future period of time for their fulfilment. Neither can it extend beyond the end of the world and the la&s;t judgment, for then the wicked will never exi&s;t any more in family and national &s;tate, to be in a capacity for the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, according to the diction of the text. Con&s;e|quently, the ungodly who peri&s;hed before Abraham, and all the wicked that are condemned in the day of judgment, are cut off from all hope of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed, by the very language in which it is expre&s;&s;ed. Again, it cannot be exten|ded to all the families and nations cotemporary with Abraham. The diction is not in the pa&s;t, nor pre&s;ent, but in the future ten&s;e, and points to &s;ome memorable future period, wherein all the families and nations of the earth then living, &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the annexed cur&s;e to his enemies, &s;hews, that his enemies did not belong to the families and nations that &s;hould be ble&s;|&s;ed in him: his friends &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, his enemies &s;hould be cur&s;ed: but that his enemies &s;hould be cur&s;ed and yet ble&s;|&s;ed in him; the &s;ame per&s;ons at the &s;ame time, is repugnant to common &s;en&s;e, and a manife&s;t contradiction. By the &s;ame rule, the families and nations who were accur&s;ed of God, and as &s;uch devoted to utter de&s;truction, could not be the objects of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings: &s;uch as the nations of Canaan, the Amalakites, &amp;c. who were devoted to utter de&s;truction and extirpation: to &s;uppo&s;e the God of Abraham &s;hould ble&s;s them with the ble&s;|&s;ings promi&s;ed to Abraham, and cur&s;e, devote and execute utter de&s;truction on them, as families and nations, is repugnant to all rea&s;on. And it is alike certain, that the&s;e promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings hath not come upon all the families and nations of the natural po&s;terity of Abraham. Is it true of the Edomites? or of the po&s;terity of I&s;hmael? Is it according to their character and &s;tate as predicted by the Spirit of truth? "and he will be a wild man; his hand will be again&s;t every man, and every man's hand again&s;t him: and he &s;hall dwell in the pre&s;ence of all his bre|thren," Gen. 16.22? Is it true of this nation "that all things are reconciled in him," that they all bow to the authority of God, have the faith of Chri&s;t, and the genuine &s;pirit of the go&s;|pel in love and peace and all go&s;pel obedience, as will be the ca&s;e, when the&s;e promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings come upon all the nations
<PB N="282" REF="019737_0301_0FACA75A632C0B28">
of the earth? Who, that is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the Arabians, and knows their character and manners, living by rapine, robbery, theft and murder from generation to generation, can think they are ble&s;&s;ed with the di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ings of Abraham, as families and as a nation? And St. Paul was &s;o far from admitting their unlimited &s;en&s;e, that in direct oppo&s;i|tion to it, he &s;hews us plainly, the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings were not to take place, in all the families of Abraham's natural po&s;terity. Not in his po&s;terity by Keturah, nor by Hagar in the line of I&s;h|mael, "but in I&s;aac &s;hall thy &s;eed be called," Rom. 9.6, 7, 8. and in the line of I&s;aac, in Jacob not E&s;au, v. 13. And it is very evident, that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings have not in fact, come upon all the families, in the line of I&s;aac and Jacob. Were the families of Corah, Dathan and Abiram and their wicked ad|herents, who peri&s;hed in terrible wrath, ble&s;&s;ed with the pecu|liar ble&s;&s;ings of Abraham? Are the Jews now as a nation, in the enjoyment of this ble&s;&s;ing? when for more than &s;eventeen hundred years they have been and now are di&s;per&s;ed, a hi&s;&s;ing, cur&s;e and execration among all nations, as predicted by Mo&s;es? Do all their families in this exiled &s;tate, enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed to Abraham, while the vail is on their hearts, and they remain in blindne&s;s, unbelief and di&s;obedience, ca&s;t out of the kingdom of God and become an execration? Such a con&s;truc|tion of the&s;e promi&s;es as extended to all nations, and all families, to all mankind in all pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and future generations, &s;eems extravagant in the highe&s;t degree. When it is &s;o notorious in fact, it never was, nor now is, true of any one nation on earth in this extent; no, not of the mo&s;t favoured of Abraham's po&s;|terity. Moreover, their con&s;truction &s;uppo&s;es, the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed to the nations and families of the earth, are promi&s;es of the heavenly inheritance to all, to whom they appertain. But upon what grounds? the &s;cripture every where connects this inheritance, not with a family or national character and &s;tate, but always with a di&s;tinctive, di&s;tingui&s;hing, per&s;onal character, in this life. The promi&s;es of it are to them, that "believe," repent, who do his commandments, to the pure in heart&mdash;in a word, to tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with the faith and piety of Abraham: the&s;e only by &s;cripture account, are &s;ubjects and heirs of the heavenly inheritance. But &s;hould weadmit

the&s;e promi&s;es de&s;igned of the heavenly inheritance, &s;till, their cau&s;e is in ruins: for the cur&s;e to the enemies of Abraham, and to the accur&s;ed nations and families, mu&s;t be under&s;tood in the &s;ame way of con&s;truction, to be an eternal exclu&s;ion from this inheritance and con&s;ignment to de&s;truction: for &s;urely, the cur&s;ed, &s;hall not inherit with the ble&s;&s;ed. It is clearly, not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the members of the families and nations on whom this ble&s;&s;ing comes, are the children of Abra|ham by that faith whereby "the ju&s;t do live" and &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the heavenly inheritance. Eli's family were under this ble&s;|&s;ing, and yet his &s;ons were &s;ons of belial, and cut off in wrath. David's family were &s;urely under this ble&s;&s;ing; and yet his &s;ons Amnon and Ab&s;alom, were children of &s;orrow to him: their wicked lives and violent deaths dive&s;ted him of all hope for them, beyond the grave; and produced a wound in his &s;oul in|curable by all the world&mdash;by every thing, but the grace of the covenant, wherein he had per&s;onal &s;afety; whence he drew his comfort and &s;upport, as "all his &s;alvation and all his de&s;ire," 2 Sam. 23.5. Well in&s;tructed and regulated families, profe&s;|&s;ing the chri&s;tian faith and godline&s;s and in covenant with God, are under this ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham: to &s;uch, the apo&s;tles apply the&s;e promi&s;es, as Acts 2.38, 39. Gal. 3.9, 27, 28, 29. and Gal. 4.28. and yet, no judicious per&s;on will &s;ay, all the mem|bers of &s;uch families are, of cour&s;e, heirs of the heavenly inhe|ritance. So likewi&s;e nations, ble&s;&s;ed with the go&s;pel and di&s;|pen&s;ation of the kingdom of God, and profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity; favoured with happy civil and religious privileges, and all de&s;i|rable advantages for obtaining the heavenly inheritance, may be called ble&s;&s;ed: although there may be thou&s;ands of mi&s;era|ble &s;ubjects in them, who make them&s;elves &s;o, by their own folly and wickedne&s;s, running their own ruin, for time and eter|nity. In this &s;en&s;e Balaam, by the &s;pirit of in&s;piration, repeat|edly pronounced I&s;rael, a nation ble&s;&s;ed, and that &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed: in Numb. 23d and 24th chapters. So &s;ays our Lord, "Ble&s;&s;ed are your eyes, for they &s;ee, and your ears, for they hear: for verily I &s;ay unto you, that many prophets and righ|teous men have de&s;ired to &s;ee tho&s;e things which ye &s;ee, and have not &s;een them; and to hear tho&s;e things which ye hear, and have not heard them," Mat. 13.16, 17. and yet he repeat|edly
<PB N="284" REF="019737_0303_0FACA75BE20B2238">
tells us, many unbelieving, impenitent &s;inners under that ble&s;&s;ed di&s;pen&s;ation, would be condemned with the workers of iniquity. The&s;e things &s;erve to expo&s;e the fallacy of their con|&s;truction. But the grand intention of the&s;e promi&s;es expre&s;sly revealed, it &s;hould &s;eem, mu&s;t clear the &s;ubject of all difficulty and di&s;pute. Thus, we are de&s;ignedly taught in them, that God would make Abraham the father of the faithful and &s;aved, of all families, ages and generations; as an example to them of &s;alvation by faith; or of that faith and piety, whereby they might be &s;aved: as Paul teaches us, Rom. 4.11, 12, 13, 16. Their con&s;truction is a direct contradiction to it, by extending the promi&s;e to them, whom our Lord &s;ays are of their father the devil, who live and die without the faith, piety and works of Abraham. Another thing intended is, that the covenant made with Abraham, whereby his own family were ble&s;&s;ed with &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings and privileges in him, &s;hould be extended to all believing families of all nations and ages under the go&s;pel; in which &s;en&s;e all tho&s;e families &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in him; as in the texts forecited in Acts and Galatians. But "the pro|mi&s;e to you and your children," is limited to the called and be|lieving in this world; and is no where extended to the wicked in the future &s;tate. This condemns their con&s;truction, for ex|tending the promi&s;e to the wicked in the future &s;tate, be&s;ide and contrary to the intention of it, for they are excluded out of it. The&s;e texts teach us, the adorable Me&s;&s;iah, &s;hould be of his &s;eed, in and by whom, all the nations have all their ble&s;|&s;ings; and all the believing and &s;aved of all nations, &s;hould be forever ble&s;&s;ed. And what is directly to our purpo&s;e is, we are de&s;ignedly taught in them, that "true believers of all other nations, as well as of the jews, &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved in him," this infallible meaning is given us, Gal. 3.7, 8, 9. "Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the &s;ame are the chil|dren of Abraham. And the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen through faith, preached the go&s;pel before unto Abraham, &s;aying, "in thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;|&s;ed. So then they which be of faith, (of whatever nation) are ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham." Their con&s;truction mu&s;t be thus; the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify and &s;ave all nations, the unbelieving as well as believing, preached be|fore

the go&s;pel to Abraham. The apo&s;tle limits it expre&s;sly to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">believing, "they that are of faith" they and they only in the intendment of the promi&s;e, are children and ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham. A man mu&s;t want eye &s;ight who doth not &s;ee their con&s;truction in extending it to all the believing, is in direct contradiction to the apo&s;tle, and to the intendment of the promi&s;e, as explained and a&s;certained by him. And he is very expre&s;s in point, in a&s;certaining the true intendment of the&s;e promi&s;es to Abraham. He tells us expre&s;sly, the &s;eed intended in this great promi&s;e, is Chri&s;t, v. 16. and confirms both the extent and limitation of the ble&s;&s;ings to them who believe, v. 22. "but the &s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in, that the promi&s;e by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t might be given to them who believe; and illu&s;trates it to the end of the chapter. And this exten&s;ion of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed, to the believing of all nations without difference, and limitation of them to the believing only; is a doctrine that runs through the &s;cripture, and particularly, all the epi&s;tles of St. Paul. And he hath taught and illu&s;trated at large, this limitation of the ble&s;&s;ings to the believing only, in the ca&s;e of the unbelieving jews, the natural po&s;terity of Abraham in the line of I&s;aac and Jacob, in Rom. 9th, 10th, 11th chapters; &s;hewing, they have cut them|&s;elves off from the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, by their unbelief; and will re|main cut off from them, till the glorious period of the recal of that nation and their ingrafting in again, by faith. What can be more deci&s;ively clear, than the limitation of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to the believing only? and their con&s;truction is as directly con|trary to the grand practical, as doctrinal intendment of the&s;e promi&s;es: they are de&s;igned to carry a mo&s;t powerful encour|agement and motive to &s;inners of all nations, to look unto Chri&s;t and turn to God and become his willing people, that they may become the happy &s;ubjects and heirs of the promi&s;es. But by extending them to all the unbelieving and di&s;obedient, the force of this grand motive is annulled, and the great de&s;ign of their reduction in this world, becomes defeated. It is impor|tant to add, the&s;e promi&s;es are de&s;igned to teach and point us to a mo&s;t memorable future time, in which, all the nations of the earth then exi&s;ting, &s;hall literally and remarkably be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, with the ble&s;&s;ings of his kingdom and grace, with
<PB N="286" REF="019737_0305_0FACA75D62F68BD8">
family and providential ble&s;&s;ings, and that for a long and very glorious period. So that all the preceding &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;|pel with jews and gentiles, is but as the fir&s;t fruits to the full harve&s;t, compared with the fulne&s;s of the gentiles in all the na|tions of them, and fulne&s;s of the jews then to be brought into the kingdom of God. So that an innumerable multitude out of all nations and languages, &s;hall be &s;aved, Rev. 7. But two things intirely overthrow their con&s;truction: one is, that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are appropriate to believing nations, and to all believ|ers in them; and are limited to them deci&s;ively, by the rule of expo&s;ition given us, as hath been &s;hewn. They are converted to the faith of Chri&s;t, and &s;o enjoy the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings in him. The other is, that however great and exten&s;ive the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are, they come upon all, who &s;hall ever participate in them, in this &s;tate, before the end of the world. It is while they are in family and national &s;tate, as the diction of the text plainly teacheth. And the &s;ummary repetitions and illu&s;trations of the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed, by the prophets, confirms it. It is promi&s;ed the Sa|viour "he &s;hould have the heathen for an inheritance and the uttermo&s;t part of the earth for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 2.8.</NOTE> But not a &s;oul from hell.

to a happy participation of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, is, "look unto me and be ye &s;aved all the ends of the earth," (including all the nations of the gentiles then living upon earth, but not a &s;oul in future mi&s;ery; they are left out excluded, and have no part in it) "for I am God and there is none el&s;e. I have &s;worn by my&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that unto me every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear.

(This clau&s;e and &s;ome parallel texts &s;eem to intimate, that there might remain &s;ome individuals, unreconciled enemies, but they &s;hould be &s;o few and feeble, as to be a&s;hamed and confounded, and in|capable of offence and di&s;turbance in all God's holy mountain.") And the jewi&s;h nation in all its fulne&s;s, at that time, &s;hall par|take in the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. "In the Lord &s;hall all the &s;eed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified and glory," I&s;a. 45.22, 3, 4, 5. and this work of God, is &s;o particularly and deci&s;ively &s;et forth as to be accom|pli&s;hed in this world, in I&s;ai. 66.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 ver&s;es, and parallel texts, as that the evidence cannot be evaded. Ver&s;e 23. "And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that from one new moon to another, and from one &s;abbath to another &s;hall all fle&s;h come to wor&s;hip before me, &s;aith the Lord." Then, "the glad tid|ings of great joy unto all people" announced by the angel at the birth of our Saviour, will be literally verified, to all people, nations and languages upon earth. Then, "the Spirit will be poured out upon all fle&s;h."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Joel 2.28.</NOTE> "All fle&s;h &s;hall come to him, who heareth prayer."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;a. 65.2.</NOTE> "The glory of the Lord &s;hall be re|vealed, and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 40.5.</NOTE> and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of God."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. 3.6.</NOTE> But when? the prophet tells us, it will be during the continuance of the pre&s;ent planetary &s;y&s;tem and revolutions of days and months, before the earth is burnt up: when it &s;hall come to pa&s;s "that all fle&s;h &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before the Lord, from one new moon and &s;abbath to another." So that if the&s;e texts teach that all men &s;hall be &s;aved; the al&s;o teach they will all be believers and true wor&s;hipers of God; and will &s;ee andenjoy the beginings of this &s;alvation, in this world;

before the la&s;t judgment and final conflagration. And when this call of God, &s;hall have its full effect, in the ingathering of the fulne&s;s of jews and gentiles (while they exi&s;t as nations in this world) into the kingdom of God; then, the&s;e great promi&s;es to Abraham, will have their full accompli&s;hment: and &s;o, as that "all the I&s;rael of God" de&s;igned in them (including the natural and &s;piritual &s;eed of Abraham, as expounded by Paul) "&s;hall be &s;aved." Con&s;equently, all the unbelieving and ungodly, who are condemned in the day of judgment, are excluded the&s;e promi&s;es, and mu&s;t remain forever excluded the ble&s;&s;ings of them. And fanciful theori&s;ts, may as well imagine the whole of this divine work of ingathering and ble&s;&s;ing the nations, &s;hall be effected not on this earth, but in the moon; as that any part of it &s;hall be effected for the wicked, after the day of judgment. There is no time, or place found and allotted in &s;cripture, for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. Then "time &s;hall be no longer" no more. And there is no place in the univer&s;e revealed, in which this great change in nature, character and &s;tate can be effected, in them. Not in heaven, for the change mu&s;t be wrought before, any can enter there: not in hell, for that is a place and &s;tate of wrath without mercy, of weeping and mi&s;ery, and not of joy and &s;alvation. Not in the new earth, for the ble&s;&s;ings of it are the inheritance of them that overcome&mdash;and the wicked have another inheritance a&s;&s;igned them&mdash;" their portion is in the lake of fire," Rev. 21.1, 7, 8. And to &s;uppo&s;e it to be effected in &s;ome new created tran&s;mutation world, is a &s;pecies of infidelity, and &s;uch an un&s;criptural romantic creature of imagination, as is unworthy any regard by any &s;ober, judi|cious chri&s;tian, who&s;e faith is bounded by revelation. So that their con&s;truction of the&s;e glorious predictions and promi&s;es, &s;tands every way confuted in &s;cripture. But tho&s;e words are cited Rom. 11.32. "God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all:" it is &s;aid this may have reference, to a more full admi&s;&s;ion of jews and gentiles in the collective &s;en&s;e into Chri&s;t's kingdom on earth; but may not be the principal meaning: that it is capable of a more exten|&s;ive &s;en&s;e, and to extend it to mankind univer&s;ally, is thought the mo&s;t noble and &s;ignificant, p. 247, 8. This text &s;eems de|&s;igned to exhibit the riches, &s;overeignty and glory of God's
<PB N="289" REF="019737_0309_0FACA75FAB76B198">
mercy in the &s;alvation of both jews and gentiles; ina&s;much as when it is di&s;played efficaciou&s;ly for their re&s;toration and &s;alva|tion, it finds them, all, in a &s;tate of unbelief. And there are two rules in the de&s;cription of this divine work (to name no more) that make it evident, it is wrought in this world, and cannot be extended to all mankind. As (1.) this great work of mercy in the re&s;toration of both, is by "graffing," and there is but one way of "graffing," by faith in Chri&s;t, which is pecu|liar to this &s;tate. "The jews were broken off by unbelief," "the gentiles were graffed by faith" "and &s;tand by faith," v. 20. and "the jews &s;hall be graffed in again, v. 24. as a nation they &s;hall be converted to the faith of Chri&s;t;" &s;hall look to him whom they have pierced and mourn," &amp;c. &s;o, &s;hall their iniquities be pardoned, and they be ble&s;&s;ed with the ble&s;&s;ings of Abraham, and of Chri&s;t, and with the joys of his &s;alvation. This method of mercy in &s;aving &s;inners whether jew or gentile the apo&s;tle teaches expre&s;sly, and profe&s;&s;edly in this chapter, in this great work of mercy in the re&s;toration of the fulne&s;s of jews and gentiles: and he teacheth none other method, nor doth the &s;cripture; and therefore, this "mercy upon all" mu&s;t be "the believing," of all nations without difference; and can|not extend to the ungraffed, unbelieving part of mankind. Which con&s;truction is a mo&s;t noble and &s;ignificant, that which falls in with the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, and &s;upports the go&s;pel con&s;titution of "graffing" and &s;alvation by faith; or that which contradicts and annuls it, is ea&s;y to determine. (2dly.) this great work of mercy, in the re&s;toration of the ful|ne&s;s of the jews and gentiles will be effected in this world; while they remain di&s;tinct nations, retaining their national cha|racters. This &s;eems very clear in the &s;everal parts of the de|&s;cription: particularly, in the great benefits that &s;hall redound to other nations, by the conver&s;ion and recall of the jews into the kingdom of God. "If through their fall &s;alvation came to the gentiles, to provoke them to jealou&s;y," v. 11. that they might return." "If their fall, was the riches of the world, how much more their fulne&s;s," v. 12. Again, "If their ca&s;ting a|way be the reconciling of the world, what &s;hall the receiving them be" (in their conver&s;ion) "but life from the dead," v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. This plainly be&s;peaks them, to be at that time di&s;tinct
<PB N="290" REF="019737_0308_0FACA760716A8340">
nations, and retaining their well known national characters. Otherwi&s;e, how is it po&s;&s;ible, that their conver&s;ion and "ful|ne&s;s" &s;hould more abound "to the reconciling of the world," and their re&s;toration be as "life from the dead" to the re&s;t of the world." And again, how is it po&s;&s;ible, that the fulne&s;s of the jews and gentiles coming in as nations, can be &s;een as co|temporary events, as taught, v. 25, unle&s;s they remain di&s;tinct nations? And this is a note of its accompli&s;hment in this world, taught by our Saviour, and repeatedly by the prophets, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It may not be improper here to notice one text, that hath been much mi&s;taken by &s;ome, Ezek. 16.53. "When I &s;hall bring again their cap|tivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Sa|maria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy cap|tives in the mid&s;t of them." It cannot be meant of the land or lake of Sodom, which it &s;eems will continue a monument of warning to all ages and generations. Nor can it be meant of the Sodomites, that peri&s;hed; that they &s;hould be recovered at the re&s;toration of the Jews; for it &s;eems they will be condemned in the day of judgment, Mark 6.11. But it mu&s;t be the Gentiles, figuratively "Sodom," whom the Jews in pride and con|tempt looked upon, unle&s;s they became Jews, as abandoned to de&s;truction, as the Sodomites. In reproof, they are here taught, in the time of their mercy and re&s;toration, the gentiles &s;hould partake of the &s;ame glorious mercy, and in equal extent and fulne&s;s. I know &s;ome have taken it as a threatning of utter ruin to the Jews, like that of Sodom; but con&s;idering the &s;ub&s;equent promi&s;es to the Jews, I prefer the &s;en&s;e already given.</NOTE> as well as by the apo&s;tle here. And this point is further confirmed in the following context. For upon the coming in of the fulne&s;s of jews and gentiles, is immediately added, v. 26, "and &s;o all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved." And this work of mercy is confirmed in that and the three following ver&s;es: and then illu&s;trated v. 30, 31. "For as ye in times pa&s;t have not believed, yet now have obtained mercy through their unbelief: even &s;o have the&s;e al&s;o not now believed, that through your mercy, they al&s;o may obtain mercy." As &s;ure as the one had obtained the mercy to be ingraffed, by faith, &s;o &s;urely &s;hould the other obtain the like mercy, in this pre&s;ent world. Now if the whole of this work of mercy treated of, re&s;pecting jews and gentiles, is in fact compleated in this world, it &s;eems evidently, again&s;t the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle, to extend this mercy to all the wicked in the future world. I would notice one objection again&s;t what hath been offered:&mdash;it is by &s;ome inferred, from this de&s;cription of the apo&s;tle, "that the non-elect reprobate jews of that time,
<PB N="291" REF="019737_0310_0FACA76122A12C60">
who were broken off by unbelief, enemies for the &s;ake of the gentiles, will be brought in, "in the fulne&s;s of the jews," and that literally all the &s;eed of I&s;rael in all generations, will be comprized in this grand re&s;toration, and be &s;aved." But in the objection, it is forgotten, that nations live and are perpetu|ated on earth, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, only. Tho&s;e that die off, are never re&s;tored, to make a con&s;tituent part of the nation any more; to be the &s;ubjects of its future ble&s;&s;ings or judgments. And con&s;equently, the predictions of ble&s;&s;ings or judgments to nations, have their accompli&s;hment in the generations living in the time of their completion, and not in any foregoing ones. This &s;trikes off the foundation of the objection. Be&s;ides, the &s;uppo&s;ition that predictions look back to foregoing generati|ons, is contrary to the nature of them: the grand de&s;ign of prophecies, is to di&s;clo&s;e the de&s;igns and future events of pro|vidence to take place in this world: the fates of mankind, the ble&s;&s;ings or judgments to come upon nations, while they exi&s;t as nations, before the end of the world. The &s;tate of all men, for the future and eternal world, are to be &s;ettled in the day of judgment, by the great promi&s;es and threatnings re&s;pecting that world; and not by prophecy, but by the &s;cripture rule of retribution. Again, it is not remembered by the objector, that the prophets predicting this glorious re&s;toration of the jewi&s;h nation, do once and again &s;tile them a "remnant," Though this "remnant" will include all the fulne&s;s of the nation in all their di&s;per&s;ions through the world, living, in that period. Thus are they &s;tiled, Micah 5.7, 8. and ch. 7. 18. and Zep. 3.13, &amp;c. They are a "remnant" a precious re&s;idue of that nation re&s;erved in infinite mercy, for the un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings of that grand period, di&s;tingui&s;hed in glory, by all the prophets, above all others, in the annals of time. Moreover, the method of their re&s;toration, is likewi&s;e forgotten, viz. "by graffing in a|gain." And there is but one doctrine of graffing for jew and gentile, and that is "by the faith of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t," while they continue nations its this world, as hath been &s;hewn. Con&s;equently, the re&s;toration plead for in the objection, is an impo&s;&s;ibility in nature, without a re&s;urrection of the unbeliev|ing dead, previous to the general re&s;urrection; which is confu|ted by our Saviour and the current doctrine of revelation. So

that the objection is wholly an anti&s;criptural, groundle&s;s mi&s;t|ake, in fact, On the whole, it &s;eems evident, in this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that the predictions and promi&s;es of ble&s;&s;ings to families and nations, and of the works of God's grace, and recovering mercy de&s;ignated in them, to be wrought for mankind, will certainly have their full accompli&s;hment in this world. And the marks and characters of their certain completion, while they exi&s;t in families and nations in this world, are &s;o inter&s;per&s;ed and inter|woven in the de&s;criptions them&s;elves, as that they can hardly e&s;cape an attentive reader. It is clearly, the mo&s;t obvious and popular con&s;truction, be&s;t adapted to the good of men, and which perhaps hath not been mi&s;taken by one of a million, of tho&s;e who have read them. So that there is not a &s;hadow of evidence, in &s;upport of their doctrine carried in the general terms in which they are expre&s;&s;ed; nor a fig-leaf of hope to be derived from them, to tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, but it is wholly cut off in their certain completion in this world. Neither is there any danger of di&s;credit to &s;cripture, by a&s;certaining their general intendment, when we certainly fall in with their grand de&s;ign; which is, the in&s;truction and be&s;t good of mankind in this world, which is be&s;t &s;ub&s;erved in the con&s;truction given. But it is that con&s;truction, which renders them perfectly loo&s;e and ambiguous, that is, di&s;reputable; that renders them &s;o du|bious and &s;ceptical, that we cannot know, who they re&s;pect and belong to, whether to the living or the dead; nor to what world of &s;ubjects, whether to this or the future; whether one already created, or to &s;ome one or more, yet to be created; and forces us, to Vulcan's forge for a meaning to them: I mean "a creature of fancy" made by the hammer of invention, on the anvil of imagination. This mu&s;t be contemptible in the eyes of judicious chri&s;tians, and tend to expo&s;e the &s;acred oracles to contempt. We have obviated his argument from P&s;a. 68.18. in what hath been &s;aid upon Eph. 4.10. where it is cited, and applied to gifts and go&s;pel means, for the recovery of man|kind in this world, only. Another text is Joh. 12.32. "And I, if I be lifted up will draw all men to me." Here it is &s;aid, is no exception of any individual of the human race; nor have any one a right to limit the merciful effect of Chri&s;t's death. But we have certainly a right to take the meaning from our

Savo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, him&s;elf: and that he meant all &s;orts and nations of men living, jews or gentiles, is evident from his after explana|tory commi&s;&s;ion given to the apo&s;tles, to preach the go&s;pel to all the living nations, and "to every creature." But he has in effect ab&s;olutely prohibited us, from extending it to final un|believers, in the parable of dives, and by teaching us "they &s;hall not &s;ee life" nor "ta&s;te of his &s;upper," and in the great day the door of mercy &s;hall be &s;hut again&s;t them, &amp;c. Another text cited, is Joh. 17.2. "As thou ha&s;t given him power over all fle&s;h, that he might give eternal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him." This he explains, "that he might give eternal life, to the&s;e all men he had &s;ubjected to him," p. 246, 7. That our Saviour did not mean, "all that were &s;ubjected to him" by "all that were given to him," is very evident from his own explanation "of tho&s;e who were given to him" in the &s;ub|&s;equent context and other places. In the 6th and following ver&s;es he &s;peaks of the&s;e "given ones" as "given him out of the world," "who had received and kept his word"&mdash; as "tho&s;e who believe" "for whom" he prays, in di&s;tinction from the re&s;t of the world: and in a parallel pa&s;&s;age he plainly teaches, he had this power over all things given him, for the purpo&s;e of giving eternal life, "to the believing" and not to the unbelieving of mankind: as Joh. 3.35. in connexion with v. 36. "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand"&mdash;and the purpo&s;e follows, "he that believeth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life: and he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." And he further tells us, John 5.37. "All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me:" they &s;hall become believers on him in this world. So that according to the explanation of our Savi|our, he intends "by tho&s;e that are given him," not all that are &s;ubjected to him, but tho&s;e who become believers on him in this world, and no more. If any one thinks this ingenious writer under&s;tands the meaning better than our Saviour, he will give him credit. Tit. 11.11. is cited, p. 248. "For the grace of God, that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared to all men." He &s;ays it may be rendered, "the grace of God, which bringeth &s;alvation to all men, hath appeared." Still the que&s;tion is, how the grace of God brings &s;alvation to all &s;orts and nations
<PB N="294" REF="019737_0313_0FACA76362F708D8">
of men? the next words an&s;wers the que&s;tion, and a&s;certains the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, by pointing out the way, and only way in which it brings &s;alvation to them, "teaching us, that deny|ing all ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world;" "looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t." While this is the only way in which this grace &s;aves all men, who will ever be &s;aved: by &s;anctifying them in "this pre&s;ent world," render it how you will, the&s;e texts in connexion, will be directly in the face of their doctrine and con&s;truction. And I &s;hould think, no man in his right mind, can think, the apo&s;tle intended to extend this grace to &s;ave men, in &s;ome future tran&s;mutation worlds; when he &s;o plainly and deci&s;ively de&s;cribes its efficacy in the &s;alvation, of men, in their &s;anctification, in this pre&s;ent world, only. It is &s;aid 1 Tim. 4.10. "God is the &s;aviour of all men; e&s;pecially of them that believe." The connexion &s;hews, this text has &s;pecial reference to God's providential protection and &s;alvation, and not that which is &s;piritual: and &s;o hath been under&s;tood by the mo&s;t judicious: in this &s;en&s;e, it hath no concern with the point in di&s;pute. But if it refer to Chri&s;t our Saviour, he may with great propriety, be termed the Saviour of all men, as he is the creator and pre&s;erver of all men, and they owe all their mercies and ble&s;&s;ings to his divine mediation and government; and as he hath opened a way by his death, that all &s;orts, cha|racters and nations of men may be &s;aved, by faith in him; and it is becau&s;e they will not come unto him, they are not finally &s;aved: and he is e&s;pecially the &s;aviour of them that believe, as he &s;aves them in fact with an eternal &s;alvation. No more, with force, can be argued from this text. Our Saviour &s;ays, John 10.16. "And other &s;heep I have, which are not of this fold: them al&s;o mu&s;t I bring, and they &s;hall hear my voice: and there &s;hall be one fold, and one &s;hepherd." From whence is argued, the wicked in the future world may be the&s;e other &s;heep, &s;o as that the whole human race &s;hall make one fold, and have one &s;hepherd," p. 229. It &s;eems nothing can be more arbitrary and groundle&s;s, than this con&s;truction: for our Saviour in all his di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ays not a word of their recovery; but many things deci&s;ively again&s;t it, as hath been &s;hewn. By &s;heep in

the foregoing part of this chapter, are meant tho&s;e of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing character in this world; it is mo&s;t natural therefore to &s;uppo&s;e in this text, is intended tho&s;e who &s;hould be called and formed into the &s;ame divine character, in this &s;tate. I have no doubt the calling in of the gentiles, is what is meant, by the other &s;heep to be brought in. Hitherto, he had mini&s;tred and col|lected his &s;heep, from the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: but he would bring in believing jews and gentiles into one fold, and they &s;hould have one &s;hepherd: which is a work appropriated to this, and not the future world. And this is confirmed in the language of the text it&s;elf, "and they &s;hall hear his voice," that is, they &s;hould believe and obey his go&s;pel, which is the con&s;tant mean|ing of it; and this is the &s;pecial work of men, in this &s;tate: there is nothing &s;aid of it in the place of torment. Whoever be meant by "the other &s;heep," the text and context confirms it, that they will be brought in, in this world: the very rever&s;e of his con|&s;truction. As to "the good tidings of great joy &s;poken of, at the birth of our Saviour, Luk. 11.10. we have &s;hewn it will be literally verified, when the fulne&s;s of jews and gentiles are brought in: and in&s;tead of "a few people" as is &s;ugge&s;ted, an innumerable multitude will be collected out of all nations and &s;aved. And as to tho&s;e that peri&s;h, it is in their own default; and it would be impious to reproach the grace of God and the Saviour, for the fault of the creature. And as to the contempt &s;hewn to the common con&s;truction, "as poor and low," here as u&s;ual&mdash;if it be the true, &s;criptural &s;en&s;e, it is certainly the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful to men; and we doubt not, in the grand arrangement of the divine government, it is as far more honourable to God and our Saviour, as it is beneficial to men.</P>
<P>We pa&s;s to his general references, to texts which &s;peak of God as "not keeping anger forever," as not "contending for|ever," "not chiding always," and "not being always wroth." The &s;en&s;e given in their &s;cheme, is tho't the mo&s;t full and &s;ig|nificant, p. 249. But if it is fitted only to delude men, it is the mo&s;t contemptible. I find not the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed, but in reference to the temporary correction of "the broken hearted, and them that fear God"&mdash;and in reference to the temporary correction of the jewi&s;h nation&mdash;to in&s;ure their national re&s;tora|tion in this world, according to God's gracious promi&s;es, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="296" REF="019737_0315_0FACA764E20843D8">
the previous vi&s;itations of his wrath: and in re|ference to &s;inners who turn from their wickedne&s;s by repentance, in this world. I find not an in&s;tance, where it re&s;pects tho&s;e con|&s;igned to the future puni&s;hment; and therefore they are all no|thing to the point in di&s;pute. How great &s;oever the encour|agement to faith, hope, repentance, &amp;c. they give to men in this world, they give none to the damned. The next general reference is, to texts which repre&s;ent the ble&s;&s;ed God "as plen|teous and abundant in mercy; who&s;e mercy endureth forever, is everla&s;ting, and from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, and is over all his works." It is &s;aid that a far more emphatically great and benevolent &s;en&s;e is given to the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, upon the &s;cheme of univer&s;al &s;alvation than the common one; and that upon the common one they can &s;carce have any meaning at all, &amp;c. p. 250. In reply, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve; the ble&s;&s;ed God is thus gloriou&s;ly characteri&s;ed, for the&s;e two purpo&s;es, (1) to exhibit what he is to our &s;inful world, under a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy; and (2dly) to exhibit what he is and will be to all, who comply with the go&s;pel terms of mercy, and become his penitent faithful &s;ervants, and meet ve&s;&s;els of everla&s;ting mercy. To them, he is literally and in the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;|&s;ions, "plenteous" and abundant in mercy, and "his mercy en|dureth forever," and is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, &amp;c. And in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e and view of the &s;ubject, there needs "the help of no art or figure," nothing but eye-&s;ight and attention, to &s;ee, his mercy extendeth over all his works, and creatures in our world, "the whole earth is full of his goodne&s;s and riches." And con&s;idering the innumerable and aggravated provocations of &s;inful men, it is fully and gloriou&s;ly manife&s;t, that he is lite|rally plenteous and abundant in mercy to them, in the plenteous and abundant mercies actually be&s;towed on them in this world, and in his officers of pardon and eternal life to them, upon the mo&s;t conde&s;cending terms of mercy: and 'tis their fault they do not become the &s;ubjects of his mercy, &s;trictly everla&s;ting. And this exhibition of his glorious character and mercy is mo&s;t wi&s;ely fitted, to draw and win &s;inners to repentance; and for the &s;upport and comfort of good men, and the promotion of true godline&s;s, which is the grand de&s;ign of it. But this mercy of God, is not to be extended to the devil and his angels, or to
<PB N="297" REF="019737_0316_0FACA765A1890988">
&s;inners, that are ve&s;&s;els of wrath, in a &s;tate of wrath and retribu|tion: &s;o to extend and apply it, is anti&s;criptural. In the ex|hibition given, the mercy of God, in the &s;cripture characters of it, &s;hines forth, in full glory. Nor is it any diminution or de|rogation of it, to &s;uppo&s;e, it will never be exerci&s;ed to unmeet &s;ubjects; nor, in any way of interference with the rights of ju&s;|tice, and the &s;upport of the authority and government of God. But to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch an exerci&s;e of it, would reflect di&s;honour upon divine wi&s;dom and mercy it&s;elf. But their plan of mercy is e&s;&s;entially different from that of &s;cripture; and is &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel con&s;titution, and the authority and government of God in this world; by emboldening men to &s;in and neglect the great &s;alvation, to their ruin in this world, and world to come: and is as reproachful to God, as it is mi&s;chievous to mankind, as hath been repeatedly &s;hewn.</P>
<P>We have now con&s;idered the paragraphs, &s;ingle texts and general references in &s;upport of the univer&s;al &s;alvation of all men; and find no collective or &s;ingle proof of any force, in the whole: &s;o far from it, that the bigger part of the paragraphs and &s;ingle texts when re&s;tored to their genuine meaning, are deci&s;ive refutations of it. And the palliating concluding ex|cu&s;e, why it is not more clearly revealed, carries as little force in it, as the other proofs. Certainly a doctrine of &s;uch magni|tude, if true, and de&s;igned to be taught and believed in our world, would have been &s;ome where deci&s;ively taught; which we clearly &s;ee, this, is not. When the &s;cripture is &s;o plain and repeated in teaching other doctrines of far le&s;s importance than this, if true; and not a &s;ingle deci&s;ive proof of this tenet given: when the tenor of revelation is, prima facie, directly again&s;t this tenet: and when it is excluded and confuted in almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible way, in which the fal&s;ity of an error can be expo&s;ed and demon&s;trated: in &s;uch a circum&s;tance, if any man will venture his precious &s;oul upon &s;uch a detected, manife&s;t delu&s;ion; one would think he mu&s;t be &s;trangely incon&s;iderate, or infatuated.</P>

<P>Several plau&s;ible things are offered under the fir&s;t objection, to evade the force of tho&s;e texts, which plainly repre&s;ent the future puni&s;hment to be eternal: as "everla&s;ting fire," "ever|la&s;ting

puni&s;hment," "everla&s;ting de&s;truction," &amp;c. I &s;hall not pur&s;ue his mode of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, but &s;elect the &s;everal eva&s;ions contained in it. Eva&s;ion (1.) It is argued from the nature and effects of the fire, by which, it is &s;aid, this puni&s;hment is effected: that it will have an end, and cannot be &s;trictly, eter|nal. It is &s;aid, to be as ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e fire to be &s;trictly e|verla&s;ting, as the hills and mountains: for it tends to an end, and will have an end according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature. Therefore from the nature of the &s;ubject, the term "everla&s;ting" applied to it mu&s;t have a limited con&s;truction. And al&s;o, it tends to de&s;troy whatever is ca&s;t into it, and we know of no bodies that can &s;o endure the force of it, but it will effect their di&s;&s;olution, in time. Whence it is inferred, the future fire and puni&s;hment will not be eternal, p. 273, 4, 5, 6. To me this ar|guing, proves nothing, but how egregiou&s;ly, great men can trifle upon the mo&s;t awful &s;ubjects, when they &s;et them&s;elves about it. For it is admitted, p. 278. "that it cannot be deter|mined, with any certainty, whether the fire of hell is to be un|der&s;tood literally or figuratively." If &s;o, why doth he plead &s;o much, and re&s;t all the force of his arguings, upon the "literal &s;en&s;e?" when if it be under&s;tood "figuratively" there is not the lea&s;t force in it. The figurative fire intended, may be &s;trictly everla&s;ting, and the epithets joined to it, a&s;certain it to be &s;o. He argues, "the epithet everla&s;ting is joined to the puni&s;hment, on account of the fire that will occa&s;ion it:" whereas, it is more natural to under&s;tand the puni&s;hment, as exegetical of the fire. And &s;ays of another text, "it is called eternal judgment, becau&s;e the effect of it will be departing into everla&s;ting fire." Whereas the obvious rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, the effect and puni&s;hment of that judgment will be &s;trictly eternal; without any reference to fire or any other figure. Again, he &s;ays, everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, is evidently termed everla&s;ting on account of the fire that is to bring on this de&s;truction, p. 285. Whereas, there is no evidence of it in the connexion, as he &s;up|po&s;es: but it is more probably &s;o de&s;cribed, to give us the true idea of the future puni&s;hment, it is an eternal &s;eparation from the life-giving pre&s;ence and glory of the Lord, in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery: this is "everla&s;ting de&s;truction." Where are we taught the future puni&s;hment will be effected by the material
<PB N="299" REF="019737_0318_0FACA7675CA26DD8">
fire of this world, that by the laws of nature will have an end? Not in &s;cripture. Contrariwi&s;e, our Lord teaches it, the ever|la&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: and how the material temporary fire of this world &s;hould be a proper pun|i&s;hment for &s;uch unembodied &s;pirits as the devil and his angels is unexplained, and inconceivable by us. Such entirely un|grounded arguing, carries no force in it. If the predication had been expre&s;sly made of the material fire of this world, there would be an appearance of weight in it: but as the "everla&s;ting" is expre&s;sly predicated of the fire of hell; the fire of that invi&s;ible world, where Paul teaches us, "the things of it (without ex|ception) are eternal; there is not a &s;hadow of force in it, or ground for &s;uch a critici&s;m. Be&s;ides, if we are to argue the duration, from this nature of fire, and the bodies thrown into it, "chaff," "tares," and dry "branches," it is fatal to their doctrine. They &s;ay, the puni&s;hment will la&s;t an "age," and to &s;ome for "ages of ages," but it is impo&s;&s;ible by the laws of na|ture, this &s;hort lived fire, upon &s;uch fuel &s;hould la&s;t but a very little while; it can't la&s;t an age, and for ages of ages. And it is ab&s;olute de&s;truction to their doctrine of re&s;toration likewi&s;e. So that they are &s;elf-condemned in their arguing, from &s;uch an ab&s;urd view, of the nature of the &s;ubject. It is not from the nature of the figure "fire" but the epithets and properties a&s;cri|bed to it, that we are de&s;ignedly taught the duration of this puni&s;hment. It is "unquenchable" "everla&s;ting fire," and a "fire that never &s;hall be quenched," the&s;e are the properties a&s;cribed to it. And if the&s;e do not teach it "uncea&s;ing" and "endle&s;s" there is no language that can do it. And it is &s;o forcibly taught, that it cannot be avoided, without direct con|tradiction. For to &s;ay it is temporary and will come to an end, when we are taught it is unquenchable and cannot have an end, and it &s;hall never be quenched, cea&s;e and have an end; is a mo&s;t palpable contradiction. Nor is it to the purpo&s;e to &s;ay, it will not have an end, till it hath effected the di&s;&s;olution of tho&s;e who &s;uffer it: for we are never taught the duration of it, by any &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed effect of it; but by the properties and epithets a&s;cribed to it. So that it is ju&s;t as certain, that it will be uncea&s;ing and endle&s;s, as that the&s;e in&s;pired teachers by the&s;e de&s;criptions, have taught us the duration of this puni&s;hment,

truly. I will only add, the &s;ubject of "this fire" would be plain and ea&s;y, if men would give an impartial attention to the &s;crip|ture repre&s;entation of it, in its connexions. "This fire" is fir&s;t taught by Mo&s;es, Deut. 32.22. "For a fire is kindled in mine anger" (that is, by the &s;ins of the di&s;obedient I&s;raelites) "and &s;hall burn to the lowe&s;t hell."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It is well known "the lowe&s;t &s;chool" always &s;ignifies "the hell," that is, the place of the future puni&s;hment of the wicked.</NOTE> This can't be the fire of this world, that by the laws of nature will come to an end. There is no difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing "this fire" of wrath may be eternal; as everla&s;ting as the immortal objects of it. Yea, it mu&s;t be eternal, if the holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and power of God be eternal, and devils and wicked men continue the immortal &s;ubjects of this indignation. This is the fire of "wrath revealed from hea|ven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and wickedne&s;s of men," "that is poured out without mixture" upon the wicked. This is the unquenchable, everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and their wicked a&s;&s;ociates. And there is no ab&s;urdity, no impropriety in &s;uppo&s;ing this fire to be everla&s;ting. And con&s;equently, there is not a &s;hadow of force, in their arguing from the nature of material fire in this world, and of chaff, tares, &amp;c. again&s;t the everla&s;ting duration of the future puni&s;h|ment. The &s;acred texts, and arguments from them, &s;tand in their full force, this eva&s;ion notwith&s;tanding. They &s;eem con|&s;cious of this, and therefore adduce, Eva&s;ion II. viz. That the fire and puni&s;hment may be &s;trictly "everla&s;ting," and yet the &s;ubjects con&s;igned to that puni&s;hment, may not continue ever|la&s;tingly in it. Several things are &s;aid to render the &s;uppo&s;ition plau&s;ible: "that the puni&s;hment may be &s;aid to be everla&s;ting, becau&s;e the fire is &s;o, although all the &s;ubjects of it, may not endure it forever:" and God may continue this fire a perpe|tual monument of his ju&s;tice, becau&s;e in &s;o large a &s;y&s;tem of rational beings, there may be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rebellious &s;ubjects, to endure this puni&s;hment: and &s;ome may endure it for a &s;hor|ter, and others for a longer duration; and &s;ome and &s;o many will endure it for ages of ages, as that in a collective &s;en&s;e, the con&s;igned to it may be &s;aid, to be tormented day and night forever and ever," &amp;c. this is &s;trenuou&s;ly argued by Mr. Scot and this author, "as a &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e," and as certainly "a
<PB N="301" REF="019737_0320_0FACA768A1DB5BC0">
po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition:" as p. 272, 284, 5, and 304, 5. thence it is inferred, the received doctrine of the future puni&s;hment can|not be maintained. Upon which I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, this eva&s;ion and the foregoing one are not mates and con&s;i&s;tent, but contradict and &s;ubvert each other. Under the fir&s;t we were told, that from the nature of fire, the word "eternal" mu&s;t have a limited con&s;truction, becau&s;e by the laws of nature, it would have an end; and that it is as ab&s;urd to apply the word "ever|la&s;ting" in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e, to it, as to the hills and mountains. But now we are told it is a &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e, that it may be ever|la&s;ting, and yet the &s;ubjects not everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed in it. This I am &s;ure, &s;ays he, is a po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition, p. 285. If this la&s;t &s;tands, the fir&s;t eva&s;ion is given up, and all the rea&s;onings upon it, &s;tand for nothing. Such contradictions, it &s;eems doth not di&s;concert the&s;e writers, and they are too frequent to &s;ur|prize us: we are &s;ea&s;oned to them. But in reply to this &s;econd eva&s;ion, I would &s;ay, as it is entirely un&s;criptural, &s;o it is an ab|&s;olutely un&s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e, that the puni&s;hment &s;hould be ever|la&s;ting, and yet the &s;ubjects of it &s;hould not endure it through|out that duration. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, (1) becau&s;e, it is an ab|&s;urdity or contradiction, in &s;uppo&s;ition. Puni&s;hment and the &s;ubjects of puni&s;hment, are &s;uch correlates, that the one cannot exi&s;t without, nor, any longer, than the other: no more, than accidents can exi&s;t without their &s;ubject: no more, than life or death, happine&s;s or mi&s;ery can exi&s;t, without a &s;ubject of the one, or the other. I deny it (2dly) becau&s;e, this &s;uppo&s;ition, would de&s;troy the force and grand intention of this threatned puni&s;hment, to men in this world. The duration, is the great terror of this puni&s;hment. And if it be revealed to be &s;trictly "eternal," as is conceded in this eva&s;ion, it is certainly de&s;igned that the whole of this endle&s;s duration, &s;hould have force to al|arm &s;inful men, to repentance and life. But if it be once &s;up|po&s;able and known, that the &s;ubjects con&s;igned to it, will not endure it, throughout the endle&s;s duration of it: from that moment, the endle&s;s duration of it, cea&s;es to be an object of fear, and has no force. And con&s;equently, the grand practical intention of the revelation of it, is defeated. The duration of a puni&s;hment for ages of ages, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of it, hath not the lea&s;t force of terror in it, any farther than each &s;ub|ject
<PB N="302" REF="019737_0321_0FACA76962264B58">
him&s;elf per&s;onally, &s;hall endure it. Suppo&s;e it, the mo&s;t terrible in nature or po&s;&s;ible, if it were to be but of one or two hours continuance to us; that duration and its con&s;equences to us, would be the whole terror of it. What others have &s;uffered before, or may do after us, would give not the lea&s;t additional weight to it. This we all do, or may know, by a moment's reflection. To exemplify it in the puni&s;hment of murther. A violent death, is the puni&s;hment to the murtherer, by the laws of God and man. God announced it to Noah, and the execu|tion is indi&s;pen&s;ibly required. The convicted murderer "mu&s;t go to the pit, and no man may &s;tay him." This puni&s;hment hath already exi&s;ted in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects, for &s;ome thou&s;ands of ages and generations, according to the notion we implead: and will continue if there be &s;ubjects of it, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, to the end of the world. And yet the long duration of this puni&s;h|ment in ages pa&s;t, and ages to come, hath not the lea&s;t influence upon any man, to re&s;train him from the crime. It is the pun|i&s;hment with its con&s;equences to him&s;elf, in this world and world to come, and its con&s;equences to his relations and friends, gives its whole and full force. Our Lord perfectly knew this, the in&s;pired prophets and apo&s;tles knew it, and therefore they never would have denounced the future puni&s;hment to be everla&s;ting, and with an intention to awaken &s;inful men to repentance and life, by the endle&s;s duration of it: if this was not in fact to be the portion of all the individual &s;ubjects of it; the intention of the threatning could not po&s;&s;ibly be an&s;wered in any other view of it. Surely, that con&s;truction and &s;uppo&s;ition, that would de&s;troy the force and grand intention of this threatened puni&s;hment to men, in this world; can never be true or admit|ted. (3dly.) We deny it, becau&s;e the &s;ubjects of this puni&s;h|ment, and their continuance in it, throughout this duration, are &s;o de&s;cribed, as will not endure &s;uch a con&s;truction and &s;up|po&s;ition. Thus, our Lord not only de&s;cribes the duration of it, but points out the &s;ubjects that &s;hall &s;uffer it, in its full du|ration. It is prepared for the devil and his angels, and they mu&s;t &s;uffer it. And he con&s;igns the finally wicked, to the &s;ame puni&s;hment and &s;ame duration. And again, he deci&s;ively fixes the endle&s;s duration of the &s;ubjects of this puni&s;hment, in that awful declaration "where their worm dieth not." The pro|noun
<PB N="303" REF="019737_0322_0FACA76A234338C0">
"their" in this connexion, fixes the endle&s;s duration of the &s;ubject, as truly as of the worm: for it cannot be "their worm" if they cea&s;e to exi&s;t; nor any longer, than they continue to be the &s;ubjects of the tormenting worm. Their endle&s;s coexi&s;tence with the never-dying worm, is the very in&s;truction intended, and it is &s;o &s;trongly and deci&s;ively fixed and a&s;certained, that it will bear no other con&s;truction. If their worm &s;hall never die, they &s;hall never cea&s;e to be the &s;ubjects of it. This arguing goes upon the &s;ame general principle adopted by our Saviour, in rea&s;oning again&s;t the &s;adduces, to infer and in&s;ure the re&s;ur|rection and immortal happine&s;s of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, from God's being "their God." It is grounded on the con|nected relation in both ca&s;es, that infers the conclu&s;ion; and in both alike. And why doth our Saviour give this de&s;cription of the never-dying worm? and what intention can it an&s;wer, but &s;trongly to convey this &s;entiment of the &s;ubject of it? Moreover (4thly.) the &s;ubjects of the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment in hell, are as particularly de&s;cribed and marked out, as tho&s;e who &s;hall enjoy the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of heaven: and there|fore, the con&s;truction and &s;uppo&s;ition we implead, cannot be admitted, without introducing ab&s;olute &s;ceptici&s;m, with re&s;pect to the future and eternal &s;tate. It is as certain in &s;cripture, that hell is the portion of all the wicked, as that heaven is, of all the righteous. And the threatnings are as pointed and per&s;onal, to all the wicked, as the promi&s;es are to all the righteous; and the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;s duration of the puni&s;hment is as much a&s;certained to all the wicked in the threatnings, as the endle&s;s duration of the hap|pine&s;s of heaven, is to all the righteous, in the promi&s;es. Con|&s;equently, if the impleaded &s;uppo&s;ition be admitted with re&s;pect to the wicked, it mu&s;t be al&s;o with re&s;pect to the righteous; for certainly, the promi&s;es and threatnings of that God who cannot lie, and impo&s;e upon his creatures, mu&s;t have one rule of con|&s;truction: and if &s;o, the happine&s;s of heaven may be everla&s;ting, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as this future puni&s;hment. That is, to be enjoyed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the large &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e: and by the righteous in the collective &s;en&s;e; not by all of them, but by &s;ome only, and who and how many of them &s;hall in fact en|joy it everla&s;tingly, an ab&s;olute uncertainty. And this will make way for a diver&s;ity in the reward, as well as puni&s;hment.
<PB N="304" REF="019737_0323_0FACA76AE8186F50">
So that notwith&s;tanding the clearne&s;s, certainty and infallibility of the&s;e promi&s;es and threatnings, to all the &s;ubjects of them, re&s;pectively, as they &s;tand in divine revelation: yet, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, we are every one plunged into ab&s;olute &s;ceptici&s;m how it will fare with us per&s;onally and individually, to eternity; whether we be the &s;ubjects of the one or the other. True, if heirs of the promi&s;es, we may by &s;ome of the promi&s;es, be &s;e|cured of a happy immortality; but not in the enjoyment of the everla&s;ting happine&s;s of heaven; for this is a portion to be en|joyed by the righteous, not all of them individually, but in the collective &s;en&s;e only: and no one can know, it &s;eems, by the promi&s;es, how that will terminate in re&s;pect to him&s;elf. What de&s;truction this &s;ceptick conclu&s;ion carries in it, to the moral character of God, to the force of the&s;e threatnings and promi&s;es, to the &s;alutory fears, hopes and joys de&s;igned to be awakened and put in exerci&s;e by the one and the other, and to the intere&s;t of religion and the kingdom of God, is too plain to need point|ing out. And how horrible mu&s;t be the impo&s;ition upon all the rational univer&s;e, in the &s;olemn &s;cene and &s;entences of the la&s;t judgment, upon this impleaded &s;uppo&s;ition? a conclu&s;ion &s;o abhorrent and pernicious in every view, together with the principle and &s;uppo&s;ition which produces it, mu&s;t &s;urely be re|jected with indignation. I will add once more, the &s;upreme unerring Judge, will certainly &s;entence the wicked to this ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment: and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, but every &s;ub|ject, &s;o con&s;igned to it, mu&s;t &s;uffer it, in its full duration. For it mu&s;t be ju&s;t, and the very puni&s;hment threatned to them, or they would not be &s;entenced to it. And to &s;uppo&s;e it will not be executed upon all the condemned to it, is directly to im|peach the truth of the Judge, and the veracity of his infallible &s;entence. And again, it would be the highe&s;t reproach to his character as Judge, to &s;uppo&s;e him to u&s;e &s;uch a prevaricating ambiguity in a final, deci&s;ive &s;entence, as this eva&s;ion mu&s;t imply; as hath been before &s;hewn. In a word, a chri&s;tian may as con&s;i&s;tently, doubt and di&s;pute his own being, as the veracity and everla&s;ting force of the final &s;entence, of the &s;upreme and infallible Judge. And therefore there is not, nor can be, any foundation for, or truth in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the puni&s;hment may be everla&s;ting, and yet the &s;ubjects con&s;igned to it, not be
<PB N="305" REF="019737_0324_0FACA76BA29EF210">
everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed. But the &s;acred texts, that teach the endle&s;s duration of this puni&s;hment, do at the &s;ame time and with the &s;ame force teach, the &s;ubjects of it, &s;hall everla&s;tingly &s;uffer it. Such ungrounded, eva&s;ive critici&s;ms (and we meet with too many of them in the&s;e ingenuous, fanciful authors) are not the genuine product of the noble art of true critici&s;m. This brings to view the genuine &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, with peculiar clearne&s;s and force: but this degenerate kind, &s;erves only to cut up and mangle, &s;acred texts and doctrines.</P>
<P>Eva&s;ion (III.) is this, there is not the &s;ame rea&s;on to under|&s;tand the word "everla&s;ting" in the &s;ame &s;trict &s;en&s;e, when ap|plied to the wicked as to the righteous; becau&s;e there are other texts, which fix the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, as applied to the righteous: as thus, "that they can die no more," are equal to the angels, are "incorruptible," "&s;hall be ever with the Lord," "receive a kingdom which cannot be moved," "an incorruptible inhe|ritance which fadeth not away," &amp;c. Whereas "it is not &s;aid of the wicked, they &s;hall always live in torment without dying," or "that their bodies &s;hall be immortal and incorruptible," but on the contrary, it is declared, "the wicked &s;hall reap corrup|tion," <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 6.8.</NOTE> "&s;hall be de&s;troyed,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 7.13.10.28.</NOTE> "that they &s;hall peri&s;h,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 10.28.</NOTE> "&s;hall &s;uffer death, the &s;econd death;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 21.23.

<P>In reply, I would fir&s;t take off the argument from the&s;e par|ticular texts, and then more particularly point out the invalidity of the eva&s;ion. The fir&s;t text is, Gal. 6.8. "He that &s;oweth to the fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption." By which is under&s;tood, &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of &s;oul and body as is effected by natural death. But the &s;cripture teaches no &s;uch doctrine of the future world. "Corruption" is u&s;ed figuratively, "for &s;in and the puni&s;hment of it," which gives the true meaning of this text. "Evil communication," it is written, "corrupts good manners." Here is no di&s;&s;olution of parts, it morally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars and ruins good manners. And it is u&s;ed for the puni&s;h|ment of &s;in, as when it is &s;aid "they &s;hall utterly peri&s;h in their own corruption," in their &s;ins and the puni&s;hment due to them.
<PB N="306" REF="019737_0325_0FACA76C63392A88">
And this figurative is much the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e in this place, "they &s;hall reap the fruit and wages of their iniquity, a&s;&s;igned to them by the word and ju&s;tice of God. Neither doth the pe|ri&s;hing of the wicked, by any means, carry the idea of di&s;&s;olu|tion in it; as in the text quoted, John 10.28. "And I give them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h." The peri&s;hing of the wicked here, is oppo&s;ed to the eternal life enjoyed by be|lievers; and intends, they will peri&s;h from the &s;alvation of God. This they may &s;urely do, in a &s;tate of endle&s;s mi&s;ery. It con|veys no idea of di&s;&s;olution or end, in any way whatever. Nor can "their di&s;&s;olution" be argued from the word "de&s;troyed." For this de&s;truction is not of their beings, but of their happi|ne&s;s, by continuing in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, only. And this idea, with the endle&s;s duration of it, is plainly pointed out by Paul, in the&s;e words, "who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with an everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and the glory of his power," 2 The&s;. 1.9. It is &s;o far from carrying the idea of di&s;&s;olution, that the contrary is evidently implied, viz. an ever|la&s;ting &s;eparation from the life-giving, happifying pre&s;ence of God, in endle&s;s mi&s;ery. It is certain, de&s;truction cannot mean di&s;&s;olution, as &s;poken of the devils, "unembodied &s;pirits," as, "art thou come to de&s;troy us before the time?" Mark 1.24. and Luke 4.34. it is explained by St. Matthew, as he puts the que&s;tion, to mean "torment," only: "Art thou come to tor|ment us before the time?" Mat. 8.29. It is evident, in the under&s;tanding of the &s;acred writers, "their de&s;truction," and their future puni&s;hment and torment, means preci&s;ely one and the &s;ame thing. Nor, can de&s;truction in the future world, mean di&s;&s;olution, as applied to the wicked, any more than to the devil and his angels. Becau&s;e, "the fire and puni&s;hment is the &s;ame, and the &s;ame duration to both; as hath been be|fore proved, from the words of our Saviour and St. John. Yea more, their own witne&s;s is clearly again&s;t them, Mat. 10.28. "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul: but rather fear him which is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell." De&s;truction in hell, is not di&s;&s;olution; the idea and doctrine of it is de&s;ignedly excluded by our Saviour in this text. And if there was none other of the &s;ame import in the bible, this alone is a full and &s;tanding confutation of it.
<PB N="307" REF="019737_0326_0FACA76D21C366F0">
"Di&s;&s;olution," is a killing of the body, whether in earth or hell, and no more: this, &s;ays our Saviour, men may do, and no more. But purpo&s;ely to exclude this notion, and bring to view an infinitely more terrible puni&s;hment, that God can and will inflict, he tells us, "the de&s;truction" of hell falls upon &s;oul and body both. It will not admit the di&s;&s;olution of the body, for that is the idea directly oppo&s;ed and contra&s;ted: and di&s;&s;o|lution applied to the &s;oul, an "immaterial &s;pirit," is inconceiv|able, and a palpable ab&s;urdity. De&s;truction here then, will bear no other &s;en&s;e than that we have given, "not of being, but of happine&s;s," and that is plain and ea&s;y. From all which, it &s;eems clear, de&s;truction in the future world, as under&s;tood and taught by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, doth not mean "di&s;&s;olution;" but that con&s;truction is fully and deci&s;ively confuted, in &s;everal texts. This prepares the way to &s;hew, the "di&s;&s;olution" of the wicked, cannot be proved by the word "death" and "&s;econd death" as applied to them in the future world: for we &s;ee this notion is excluded, in the doctrine of their de&s;truction taught us; and it is particularly rejected and confuted by our Saviour, in the la&s;t text con&s;idered. And it cannot be introduced and &s;upported by the word "death" or by any texts whatever, a|gain&s;t the force of &s;uch a deci&s;ive authority. And if we take, not imagination, but the &s;cripture for our guide and rule, it &s;eems the meaning may become plain and ea&s;y. For "death," denoting the puni&s;hment of the future world, mu&s;t have a dif|ferent con&s;truction, from natural death; according to the diffe|rent con&s;titution of the two worlds: the one "temporary," the other "eternal." 2 Cor. 4.18. This to me appears an obvious and certain rule of con&s;truction. "Death" then, as applied to the future world, is &s;o far from carrying the idea of di&s;&s;olution in it, as that it is incompatible with it. It is "dying thou &s;halt die" without end, according to the fir&s;t threatning. It is eter|nal, as all things pertaining to that con&s;titution, are. And this rule of con&s;truction ought to govern the meaning of all the&s;e texts, in the &s;ame manner. But in direct contradiction to this rule, this author carries the idea of natural death into the future world; and affixes it to the &s;econd death. He gives us an ima|ginary de&s;cription of it, too long to be in&s;erted, concluding in this, "that upon this di&s;&s;olution, they have no more concern
<PB N="308" REF="019737_0327_0FACA76DE2534310">
with that world, than the dead have with this," as before noted. This is purely the work of imagination. Doth the &s;cripture teach us &s;o; that there is a time when they will have no more concern with that world? no, it gives not the lea&s;t countenance to this pernicious fancy, but teaches the contrary, "their worm &s;hall never die." The fir&s;t threatning, "dying thou &s;halt die," being oppo&s;ed to life and happine&s;s, imports a perpetual exclu|&s;ion from life and happine&s;s, in mi&s;ery as la&s;ting as their exi&s;t|ence, as before noted. And it is ob&s;ervable, no more of this threatning is included in the judicial &s;entence of natural death, than to an&s;wer there two grand purpo&s;es, viz. to exhibit a &s;trong te&s;timony to mankind of the exceeding evil of &s;in, and God's holy indignation again&s;t it: and yet, be con&s;i&s;tent with a new and further &s;tate of trial to Adam and his po&s;terity, upon the ground of the promi&s;ed &s;eed and &s;aviour. The &s;entence is not in the words of the threatning: the word death, is not in it. But "du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t &s;halt thou return." This &s;entence, and the execution of it, in natural death, were not de|&s;igned to teach us the full demerit of &s;in, or the full puni&s;hment in the threatning. Nor is the term &s;econd death, de&s;igned to teach us a di&s;&s;olution of the &s;ame kind with natural death, in the future world; and that &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution is the whole pun|i&s;hment due to &s;in, and contained in the divine threatnings. For the contrary idea and doctrine of it, is clearly and &s;trongly held forth to us, in the de&s;criptions of it, throughout the new te&s;tament: and particularly by Paul, Rom. 6. 21, 22. where "this death" is contra&s;ted with the "everla&s;ting life" that is the end of the faithful &s;ervants of God: and in v. 23, it is contra&s;ted again, with that "eternal life" that is the gift of God to them: "for the wages of &s;in is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord." "This death" &s;o re|peatedly and directly contra&s;ted with eternal life, as given of God and enjoyed by the faithful, is evidently "eternal death." So, his friend Dr. Taylor under&s;tands it truly. Now take this declaration of the apo&s;tle in connexion with the words of the fir&s;t threatning "dying thou &s;halt die," without end or eter|nally, and it gives the true &s;entiment of this death, as oppo&s;ite to that of a temporary di&s;&s;olution, as can be. And again, this idea and &s;entiment, as contrary to a temporary di&s;&s;olution, as
<PB N="309" REF="019737_0328_0FACA76EA20F92F0">
po&s;&s;ible, is carried in all the literal de&s;criptions of this death and puni&s;hment, as everla&s;ting, as "everla&s;ting puni&s;hment," "everla&s;ting de&s;truction," &amp;c. Moreover, to me it &s;eems clear, the apo&s;tle de&s;ignedly excludes this idea of the mortality of the wicked, and purpo&s;ely introduces &amp; teaches that of their immortality in their re&s;urrection. In Rev. 20.14. "Death and hell, hades, were ca&s;t into the lake of fire, this is the &s;econd death." The obvious meaning &s;eems to be this, "the wicked in the general re&s;urrection, which he had been de&s;cribing, &s;hall be rai&s;ed in a &s;tate of immortality." There &s;hall be no more natural death to them&mdash;no more di&s;&s;olution and &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;eparation between &s;oul and body, as hades. The&s;e temporary puni&s;hments are ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed, and are &s;ucceeded by the &s;econd death, which is without di&s;&s;olution, and without end. To this con&s;truction "death &s;hall be no more," "there &s;hall be no more hades," this author oppo&s;es two which he calls in&s;u|perable objections, p. 397. (1.) "It is not true in fact, he &s;ays, for the wicked after they are rai&s;ed from the dead, &s;hall die again, as we have repeatedly &s;hewn." It is true, he a&s;&s;erts and repeats the doctrine of their di&s;&s;olution, once and again: but this is no proof. He neither hath nor can prove it. The argument then, amounts to this, "it is not agreeable to his &s;en|timent and con&s;truction, and therefore cannot be true." It carries all the force it can, it &s;peaks for it&s;elf, without a com|ment. His 2d. rea&s;on is, "if the total de&s;truction of death and hades be meant, how comes it to pa&s;s that total de&s;truction is not the thing meant, when the wicked are &s;aid in the &s;ame words "to be ca&s;t into the lake of fire?" The rea&s;on &s;eems obvious, it re&s;pects two e&s;&s;entially different &s;ubjects: the one re&s;pects tem|poral death and hades, a kind of puni&s;hment, which &s;hall be no more: the other, re&s;pects the wicked now in a &s;tate of immor|tality, con&s;igned to another kind of puni&s;hment, the &s;econd death, without end. The&s;e things are clearly con&s;i&s;tent. And this con&s;truction &s;eems confirmed by ver. 8th of the next chap|ter; where it is affirmed of the wicked "they &s;hall have their part (or "portion" a the word is rendered Mat. 24.51. and Luke 12.46.) in the lake which burneth with fire and brim|&s;tone: which is the &s;econd death." The meaning &s;eems this, "the puni&s;hment repre&s;ented by the lake of fire and brim&s;tone
<PB N="310" REF="019737_0329_0FACA76F61A455D0">
(dreadful and endle&s;s as it is) is the future "portion of the wicked:" this portion and puni&s;hment, and not di&s;&s;olution, is preci&s;ely the thing intended, in the phra&s;e "&s;econd death." The eva&s;ion tells us, it is not &s;aid of the wicked they &s;hall al|ways live in torment without dying:" but their immortality, uncea&s;ing, endle&s;s mi&s;ery is literally taught in tho&s;e words "they &s;hall be tormented day and night forever and ever," Rev. 20.10. the amount is the &s;ame. And our Saviour taught it, not only in the de&s;truction of &s;oul and body in hell; but in &s;uch a plain, &s;trong and deci&s;ive manner, as cannot be evaded, in his a&s;cription of immortality to their worm: which de&s;ignates the immortality of the &s;ubject, the correlate of the worm, as truly as of the worm it&s;elf; and this mu&s;t be his intention, as hath been &s;hewn. It is very true, that immortality, incorruptibility joined with life, is not taught of the wicked in the future world, as it is of the righteous: and it is with wi&s;e, good rea&s;on, and the greate&s;t propriety: becau&s;e, it is a&s;cribed to the righteous as their crowning ble&s;&s;ing and reward: whereas, the immorta|lity of the wicked, is the rever&s;e. A &s;imilar de&s;cription would only have &s;erved to intangle and embarra&s;s, if not confound the &s;ubject; by making the &s;en&s;e ambiguous, as applied to the one and the other. Neither is there any rea&s;on to think, it would have &s;topped the mouths of critical cavaillers; but would rather have given them more advantage to perplex, and em|barra&s;s the &s;ubject. An unbia&s;&s;ed mind, finds the immortality of the wicked, clearly taught in the texts which have been ad|duced: and notwith&s;tanding the idea of a temporary di&s;&s;olution is &s;o plainly, repeatedly and &s;trongly excluded; yet, they will adhere to it. Another in&s;tance perhaps may &s;atisfy the reader, Notwith&s;tanding the apo&s;tle has de&s;cribed a glorious re&s;urrect|ion and happy immortality, as the appropriate privilege of the righteous, in the mo&s;t deci&s;ive manner, 1 Cor. 15th chap. yet we find they will have "death de&s;troyed" to be death &s;wallowed up in the victory of the wicked, as well as the righteous; again&s;t the tenor of &s;cripture and the whole force of the connexion, in the context. So that all his pains and clearne&s;s, doth not prevent this wrong application. Doubtle&s;s, the&s;e great &s;ubjects are taught and left to us in the be&s;t manner, to prevent mi&s;takes, to avoid confu&s;ion, and preclude objections. And to me there
<PB N="311" REF="019737_0330_0FACA770239D62C8" MS="y">
appears a di&s;play of divine wi&s;dom in the different manner, in which the immortality of the righteous and wicked taught unto us.&mdash;I will add, if the&s;e critical gentlemen, in&s;tead of exerting the whole force of genius, upon the impracticable, im|po&s;&s;ible attempt to transfer the &s;ame ideas from a temporary, to an eternal con&s;titution and &s;tate of things; had entered upon the &s;ubject, in a true &s;pirit of critici&s;m, upon the ground of this clear di&s;tinction between the two worlds, they would have found two things of great weight: one is, they would have found the immortality of the &s;ubject, in all the everla&s;ting promi&s;es and threatnings of the go&s;pel. For it is impo&s;&s;ible, everla&s;ting life &s;hould be enjoyed, but by a &s;ubject that is immortal; or that everla&s;ting puni&s;hment &s;hould be &s;uffered, without the immor|tality of the &s;ubject of it. And therefore, in all the&s;e promi&s;es and threatnings, the immortality of the &s;ubject of the one and the other, is as fully and de&s;ignedly taught us, as the endle&s;s ble&s;&s;ing or cur&s;e it&s;elf. It is &s;o nece&s;&s;arily included, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate it in thought, or conceive of the fulfilment in truth, and fact, without the immortality of the &s;ubject. The other thing they would have found and told us is, that the im|mortality of the righteous, as well as the wicked, is far oftener taught us, perhaps four times to one more, in this way, by pro|mi&s;es of life, that carry it nece&s;&s;arily in them; than, in direct a&s;&s;ertions of it. From all which it appears, the eva&s;ion avails nothing; for although the immortality of the wicked, be not taught improperly, as the objection &s;eems to require: yet their mortality and di&s;&s;olution is denied once and again; and their immortality is repeatedly a&s;&s;erted in &s;trong terms, "in their worm that dieth not," which is equivalent to their living always in torment without dying, and "in death and hades ca&s;t into the lake of fire," and other texts that have been cited: and it is likewi&s;e taught, in all the de&s;criptions of their "death," "de|&s;truction" and "puni&s;hment" as "eternal" and "everla&s;ting;" in the &s;ame way and with the &s;ame force, as the immortality of the righteous, is the mo&s;t commonly taught in the promi&s;es. In a word, all the threatnings of damnation and the future pun|i&s;hment, and promi&s;es of &s;alvation, throughout revelation, are without end; and con&s;equently, all the promi&s;es and threatnings of the future world, implicitly teach, the immortality of the
<PB N="312" REF="019737_0331_0FACA77116CE9B98">
&s;ubjects of them: and therefore, what is &s;ugge&s;ted in the eva|&s;ion can be no objection, to applying the word "everla&s;ting" in the &s;ame endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, to the wicked as to the righteous. And the argument, e&s;pecially from the &s;ame word in the final &s;entence, con&s;idered in all the connexions aforementioned, re|mains in its full force. And I am mi&s;taken if the truth and weight of this argument doth not appear with clear and &s;tronger force, the more clo&s;ely it is examined. I would &s;ubjoin one argument more to fix the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, as applied to the wicked, which I have not &s;een noticed by any of the&s;e criticks, which &s;eems to be weighty, viz. the wicked will be &s;entenced to the &s;ame everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, with the devil and his angels. And the word "everla&s;ting" in this &s;entence, carries the immor|tality of the wicked, and the endle&s;s duration of their puni&s;h|ment, in it; as clearly and fully, as that of the devil and his angels. And it is an implied, full confutation of the notion of their di&s;&s;olution; as al&s;o, of their con&s;truction of the word "age and di&s;pen&s;ation" in the la&s;t &s;entence. For where do we find mortality a&s;cribed to them; or, the word eternal, in this limited con&s;truction, applied to &s;et forth the future puni&s;hment of the devil and his angels? they make not the vain attempt to prove it. And yet without this, the argument for the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the word continues in full force. For our Lord doubtle&s;s in|tended to teach the &s;ame duration of puni&s;hment, to the wick|ed, as to them; in this emphatick de&s;cription "the fire," "the everla&s;ting one" prepared for the devil and his angels." If &s;o, and the word "eternal" as applied to them, is always taken in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; it deci&s;ively fixes the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in re&s;pect to the wicked. There are two &s;cripture texts cited to &s;upport this eva&s;ion, which will as properly be con&s;idered under the next, to which we pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The 4th and capital eva&s;ion is, "that the word aion and ai|onios, tran&s;lated forever and eternal, are &s;o far from being con|fined in their meaning to an endle&s;s duration, that they really &s;ignify nothing more than an age, di&s;pen&s;ation or period of con|tinuance, either longer or &s;horter:" and are mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, both in the old and new te&s;tament. And therefore the preci&s;e duration intended in any place cannot be known, but by the previou&s;ly known nature of the &s;ubject, or
<PB N="313" REF="019737_0332_0FACA771A2088640">
other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which explain it. P. 224, 264, and 8.</P>
<P>That if we confine our&s;elves to the mere force of the word, it more probably means a limited than endle&s;s duration, becau&s;e, this is the mo&s;t frequent u&s;e of it in the &s;acred writings," p. 260. And to give the objection the utmo&s;t advantage, and that be &s;uppo&s;ed (which it is &s;aid, can never be proved) "that the word aionios, eternal, &s;ignifies duration without end; and when u&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e, it is in a lax, le&s;s proper way of &s;peaking: yet as the &s;cripture has taught us this lax &s;en&s;e; it may be &s;o applied to the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, and con&s;e|quently it cannot by the force of the&s;e words u&s;ed to de&s;cribe it, be proved to be without end, p. 270, 271. In reply to this eva&s;ion, I would remark &s;ome things generally, upon the &s;eve|ral matters contained in it; and then in a more direct way e|vince, the invalidity of it.</P>
<P>I would fir&s;t ob&s;erve, the u&s;e of the&s;e words &s;ometimes in the lax, limited &s;en&s;e, is no new di&s;covery of the&s;e ingenuous gen|tlemen; it hath been known by learned men of all ages: but that it is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;tament, cannot be admitted. For, it is allowed, p. 284. that it is u&s;ed more than forty times for the future &s;tate and life of the righte|ous: whereas, the whole li&s;t of texts for the limited &s;en&s;e, are a little more than thirty, and &s;ome of them di&s;putable. And when the numerous texts are added, which characterize the ble&s;&s;ed God as eternal and everla&s;ting, and which de&s;cribe his being, throne, kingdom, power, truth, word and glory, as for ever and forever and ever&mdash;and in the doxologes, it will produce a large &s;urplu&s;&s;age, in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. Nor do I believe it true in fact, in re&s;pect to the old te&s;tament. The texts, that celebrate the mercy of God only, as enduring forever, are more in number than all they have produced for a limited con&s;truction. And the texts that teach us, God is everla&s;ting, that his arm, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s, his throne, dominion, kingdom, glory and word are everla&s;ting and endure forever, are numerous; exclu|&s;ive of the promi&s;ed, everla&s;ting rewards of the righteous. But I have given no great attention to this, for with me the frequent u&s;e of the words in the lax &s;en&s;e, is not weighty: we mu&s;t have more &s;olid ground, and a more deci&s;ive rule of con&s;truction, for a judicious mind to re&s;t upon, in matters of eternal concern|ment,
<PB N="314" REF="019737_0333_0FACA7726312F160">
Which leads to another remark, viz. that the frequent u&s;e of a word in &s;cripture, is at be&s;t but a precarious rule&mdash;and that we mu&s;t previou&s;ly know the &s;pecific nature of a &s;ubject, before we can know the &s;en&s;e of a word applied to it, to me appears ab&s;urd. Frequency of u&s;e is evidently precarious, be|cau&s;e, if the &s;ame word do not re&s;pect the &s;ame &s;ubject and world, as when mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed; it is ab&s;olutely no rule at all, or becomes a fal&s;e one. The word "God" frequently de|notes him who is God by nature, and it is frequently u&s;ed of tho&s;e who are not god by nature, and &s;ometimes applied to men as gods by office, by delegation of authority and power. To determine the meaning of the word, in any particular text, we never turn a thought in which &s;en&s;e it is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed, but by the connexion, we &s;ee which is intended by the &s;acred writer, and that determines us in a moment, without any refe|rence to frequency of u&s;e. Ju&s;t &s;o, &s;hould the evident inten|tion of the &s;acred writers determine us to the limited or endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words in di&s;pute. The &s;en&s;e of the &s;ame words, always u&s;ed in a limited con&s;truction, when applied to things and &s;ubjects of this world; is ab&s;olutely changed, when applied to &s;ubjects in the future world, into endle&s;s. This we &s;ee in their own example, of aionios "eternal" joined with zoes, life: For the word "life" is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in &s;cripture for this natural, mortal life "which is of few days and full of trouble." And they tell us, the word aionios mo&s;t commonly &s;ignifies an age or di&s;pen&s;ation, and it hath always a limited con&s;truction when applied to the &s;ubjects of this world. By this rule then, both the&s;e words ought to have a limited con&s;truction when joined and applied to &s;ubjects in the future world; becau&s;e mo&s;t commonly &s;o u&s;ed and it is their invariable &s;en&s;e as applied to the &s;ubjects of this world: whereas, when joined and applied to &s;ubjects in the future world, "everla&s;ting life," they are certainly both endle&s;s. And it is equally true of the words, "death," "de&s;truction" and "puni&s;hment," when applied to &s;ubjects in the future world; as of life, their &s;en&s;e is changed in the &s;ame manner. This in point, &s;hews the fal&s;ity of their r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le of applying the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of words as mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed of &s;ubjects of this world, to the &s;ubjects of the future world.

true, we mu&s;t be appri&s;ed of the general &s;ubject treated of, whether it be God or the creature, a &s;ubject of this world or the future, in order to under&s;tand it. But that the &s;pecial na|ture and properties of the &s;ubject, mu&s;t be fir&s;t known; as that God is eternal, the fire of hell endle&s;s, the immortality of the righteous and wicked, and the reward and puni&s;hment of the future world is endle&s;s, before we can know and fix the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the words, by which, the whole of this &s;ubject is de|&s;ignedly taught us; to me is ab&s;urd. Becau&s;e it &s;uper&s;edes the need of teaching, if the &s;pecial nature and properties of the &s;ub|ject be already known. Be&s;ides, upon this plan, matters of pure revelation can never be taught, if we cannot know the &s;en&s;e and force of the words, by which, it is to be communica|ted to us, without a previous knowledge of the &s;pecial nature and properties of the &s;ubject. For by &s;uppo&s;ition the &s;ubject is before, wholly unknown to us. Now a rule to explain re|velation, that renders teaching needle&s;s, and by which matters of pure revelation (and &s;uch are the eternal concernments of the future world) cannot be taught; is ab&s;urd in a high degree. Surely, the in&s;pired teachers did not impo&s;e this impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k upon jews and gentiles, that they mu&s;t previou&s;ly <HI>know</HI> the &s;pecific nature and properties of the &s;ubjects they taught them, as a prerequi&s;ite to their under&s;tanding the meaning of the words they make u&s;e of, in teaching them. So that the&s;e lear|ned criticks, it &s;eems, have involved the &s;ubject in &s;evenfold more darkne&s;s, than when they took it up. For we are told, "the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words cannot be known with certainty," but by their rules, and the&s;e we &s;ee to be evidently fal&s;e and ab&s;urd: and con&s;equently, they have thrown and left the &s;ub|ject, in a labyrinth of &s;ceptici&s;m.&mdash;Another remark, which may tend to break the force of this objection, is this, "that we always fix the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e to the word "forever" when applied to the &s;ubjects of the future world; and yet it is probably as frequently u&s;ed in the lax &s;en&s;e with us, when applied to the things of this world, as it was in the days of in&s;piration: and we have no rea&s;on to believe but that the limited &s;en&s;e as appli|ed to the things of this world, and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e as applied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e of the future world, was as clear, fixed and certain then, in the mind of the in&s;pired teachers and of them who were taught

by them, as it hath been with the chri&s;tian church ever &s;ince. The word "forever" is frequently and abundantly u&s;ed in the lax, limited &s;en&s;e, in the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s in this world. It is &s;o u&s;ed, commonly, in all ab&s;olute gifts, grants, conveyances and &s;ecurities; as in bills of &s;ale, warrantee-deeds, in ab&s;olute grants by will, of lands and chattels and the like; they are ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the word "forever." Now, the word thus applied, is &s;o limited by the general nature of the &s;ubject, that no one takes it in the &s;trict endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; or to mean any more than that the grantee &s;hould hold the premi&s;es as long as can be by the force of this tenure, according to the nature of the thing and cour&s;e of this world: and yet this frequent u&s;e of the word in this lax &s;en&s;e; and always &s;o when applied to the &s;ubjects of this world, introduces no embarra&s;&s;ment or difficulty in our minds, in affixing the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e to the &s;ubjects of the future invi&s;ible world. Nor can I &s;ee a &s;hadow of rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this di&s;|tinction was not as clear to men in the days of in&s;piration, as it is to us: or that the lax &s;en&s;e applied to &s;ubjects of this, and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e when applied to &s;ubjects of the future world, was not as clear and fixed with him, as it hath been with the body of the chri&s;tian world, ever &s;ince. It is ab&s;urd &amp; incredible to &s;up|po&s;e, they under&s;tood the word as applied to the covenant with Noah and every living creature, and to the temporary &s;tatutes of the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution, to their inheritance in Canaan, to the hills and mountains, and to the &s;ervant who&s;e ears was bored, that "mu&s;t &s;erve forever," Exod. 21. 6. in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e: as, when applied to the everla&s;ting God, to the inheritance of the &s;aint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in heaven, and other &s;ubjects of the future world, where there is nothing to limit it, and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, is by far the mo&s;t natural and rational. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a man to ri&s;e up a|mong us, to di&s;pute the public known faith of the people in this land, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement to this day; on this ground. He argues, you cannot prove they u&s;ed the word "forever" in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, when applied to the &s;ubjects of the invi&s;ible world; unle&s;s, "they always u&s;ed it in this &s;en&s;e, only." But they certainly u&s;ed it &s;ometimes (that is when applied to the things of this world) in a limited &s;en&s;e: and if they u&s;ed it &s;o, in the &s;ingular number, the plural "forever and ever" cannot e&s;&s;entially alter the &s;ignification of the word. Again, they
<PB N="317" REF="019737_0336_0FACA774A161CE90">
certainly u&s;ed it very commonly, in the limited &s;en&s;e, in the cour&s;e of their worldly tran&s;actions. Look into the probate records, you find ab&s;olute gifts and devi&s;es of goods, chattels and lands expre&s;&s;ed by the word "forever." And in their com|mon regi&s;ters, you find ab&s;olute conveyances of lands by deeds of gift or &s;ale, "to them and their heirs forever." Thence it appears, their mo&s;t common and frequent u&s;e of the word "for|ever" was in the limited &s;en&s;e, not &s;trictly eternal. And there|fore, as they have taught us the u&s;e of the word in the lax &s;en&s;e, and that more commonly than in the &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, (if the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e be &s;o) it cannot be thought hard or unrea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e they affixed the limited &s;en&s;e to it, when ap|plied to the &s;ubjects of the future world. Certainly, a &s;tring of &s;uch arguments as long as one's arm, would carry no force of conviction to any judicious per&s;on, who knew it to be their common faith; that in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, the righteous would be forever happy, and the wicked forever mi&s;erable. And the &s;ame fallacy attends the rea&s;oning from the lax &s;en&s;e, and its being frequently &s;o u&s;ed in &s;cripture, when applied to things in this world; it carries not a &s;hadow of proof, that the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e was not always fixed to all the &s;ubjects of the future world. This, if I mi&s;take not, breaks the force of this grand argument and manner of arguing. The different &s;ubjects to which the&s;e words were to be applied in the limited and endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, was no doubt a matter as clear as day, to the in&s;pired teachers; and they taught it clearly, and not in the perplexed, embarra&s;&s;ing manner, as is pretended. Therefore, if we can happily find their due, and the ground they went upon, the &s;ubject mu&s;t be deci|&s;ively clear to us, and the whole foundation of the objection mu&s;t be removed. Wherefore, for a more direct reply, let it be noted, that the word "aion" in the etymology of it, is naturally and for|cibly expre&s;&s;ive of "endle&s;s duration." It is well known to be a compound of ai, always, and on, exi&s;ting; and the idea clearly conveyed by it, is "endle&s;s exi&s;tence." It is further to be no|ted, that the in&s;pired teachers, certainly u&s;ed this noun and ad|jective abundantly, in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; according to its natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">port. For by the&s;e words they abundantly taught the things of the eternal world; u&s;ing the word adaios but twice in the new te&s;tament, as before ob&s;erved. Again, by the force of
<PB N="318" REF="019737_0337_0FACA77562B7A648">
the&s;e words, they taught eternal things, plainly, properly, prac|tically and forcibly; with an intention, that they &s;hould have a governing influence over the hearts and lives of men, learned and unlearned. So did our Lord, "labour not for the meat that peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endureth unto everla&s;t|ing life," "he that believeth hath everla&s;ting life," "the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him, a well of water &s;pringing up unto everla&s;ting life," "he that eateth of this bread &s;hall live forever." So Paul taught "the hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens," &amp;c. And it is obvious, that all the&s;e in&s;pired teachers intended, that jew and gentile, &s;cythian, bar|barian, bond and free, children and &s;ervants, &s;hould under&s;tand eternal things by the force of the&s;e words, whereby they taught them; even tho&s;e who could not determine the &s;en&s;e of the words by any previous knowledge of the nature of the &s;ubject; and that by the knowledge of them &s;o conveyed, they &s;hould be induced to live by the faith of them; and endure through the &s;ervices and trials of this life, "by looking to things un&s;een and "eternal." Now in the whole of this doctrine they could not u&s;e the words, for "a di&s;pen&s;ation," "age and period," but in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e only. For they could not teach eternal things in any other &s;en&s;e of the words; and they certainly &s;o u&s;ed them properly and forcibly. For it is ab&s;urd to &s;ay, they u&s;ed impro|per word or words, who&s;e force was inadequate to their intention. I will add, more than all this, they have taught us, the e&s;&s;ential difference between the con&s;titution of things in this and the fu|ture world; &s;o as deci&s;ively to fix the limited and endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, perpetually, in the u&s;e of them: as in two point to name no more, viz. one is, by divine con&s;titution the things of this world are temporary, and the things of the invi&s;ible world are "eternal." The other is, the pre&s;ent is a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, the future a &s;tate of retribution, of rewards and pun|i&s;hments, only. This is fully &s;ufficient for our purpo&s;e. For the&s;e doctrines fix the limited &s;en&s;e, to all things of this world and &s;tate, to which they are applied: and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, to all things in the invi&s;ible world, with ea&s;e and ab&s;olute certainty. Upon this ground, their perpetual u&s;e of the words, as appli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the&s;e e&s;&s;entually different &s;ubject, is very clear; and the &s;ub|ject ea&s;ily taken up by learned and unlearned, jew and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

&s;cythian, barbarian, bond and free. And their doctrines of the invi&s;ible world as "eternal" would come with certainty and force upon tho&s;e, who could not po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand their pre|vious nature as &s;uch, but as they taught it to them. Thus it was doubtle&s;s taken up in the days of in&s;piration, as it hath been by the chri&s;tian church ever &s;ince, a handful only excepted. The&s;e things are too obvious, to need enlargement. And two things &s;eem plainly to follow from this &s;tating, viz. (1.) That the endle&s;s and everla&s;ting &s;en&s;e, is the primary, mo&s;t proper, and mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words and phra&s;es. And that when they are applied to the things of time in a limited man|ner, it is always in a figurative, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x and le&s;s proper &s;en&s;e. And therefore (2dly.) they ought always to be taken in the never|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding &s;en&s;e, where there is nothing in the known nature of the &s;ubject, or manner of de&s;cription, or &s;ome note and mark (time to limit their con&s;truction.

There being no rea&s;on in &s;uch ca&s;e, to limit, but every rea&s;on for the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. And this rule of rea&s;on, is confirmed by this argument, "the in&s;pired teachers have in fact, them&s;elves limited the con&s;truction, in every in&s;tance, where it is de&s;igned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e limited." I cannot find they have left any thing to ima|gination, and the uncertain rea&s;onings of men, in this important affair. For where a confined con&s;truction is de&s;igned, and it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> obvious from the known nature of the &s;ubject, as "tempo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">" as it is when applied to the covenant with Noah, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution, to the inheritances of Ca|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and to the hills and mountains and the earth it&s;elf: in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e they have con&s;tantly given us, &s;ome character and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of limitation, either in the manner of the de&s;cription, or by &s;ome affixed note of time, as chronon, autou, nun, telia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the like: from whence we rationally conclude, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we know nothing in the nature of the &s;ubject to confine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;e, and they have given us no note of limitation, they always de&s;ign we &s;hould under&s;tand the words in the never|ending &s;en&s;e: for otherwi&s;e they would, after their con&s;tant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, have affixed &s;ome note of time, to them. And as they
<PB N="320" REF="019737_0339_0FACA7770A74BE18">
have affixed no note of limitation to any of the things of the in|vi&s;ible world, the&s;e words &s;o applied, ought always to be taken in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e. And I &s;ee not that any man can have any more right to put a limited con&s;truction to them, when &s;o ap|plied, than by interpolation, to in&s;ert a new text in revelation, contrary to the general import of it. This makes way for an ea&s;y an&s;wer to the argument from two texts of &s;cripture, to prove that the &s;ame words in the la&s;t &s;entence may have a different con&s;truction as applied to the righteous and wicked. The texts are Rom. 16. part of the 25th and 26th ver&s;es, "According to the mi&s;tery which was kept &s;ecret (chronois aioniois) &s;ince the world began; but now is made manife&s;t, according to the com|mandment (tou aioniou Theou) of the everla&s;ting God." And Tit. 1.2. In hope (zoes aioniou) of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promi&s;ed (pro cronon aionion) before the world be|gan. Here it is &s;aid the "adjective" as applied "to God and life" upon the principles of the objectors, is to be taken in the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; but in both ver&s;es where it is joined with "chro|non" it hath a limited con&s;truction. The conclu&s;ion drawn from it is this, that we cannot complain of the con&s;truction they put upon Mat. 25. in affixing the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the word in the &s;ame &s;entence to the righteous, and a limited one to the wicked, as being hard or unrea&s;onable, without condemning our&s;elves, p. 289, 90. The an&s;wer is ea&s;y, the adjective as ap|plied to God, and to life in the future world, hath nothing to limit it; and where in&s;piration doth not limit it, no man hath a right to do it; and we therefore receive it in the end|le&s;s &s;en&s;e. But in the other part, there is a note of time and limitation expre&s;sly &s;et forth; and we accordingly give it a limited con&s;truction; and herein we are clearly &s;elf-con&s;i&s;t|ent. But there is no note of limitation, as it is applied to the wicked in the 25th of Mat. or any where el&s;e, any more than to the righteous; and therefore the ground of complaint re|mains in full force, again&s;t them. And ina&s;much as the &s;entence to both, is on the ground of the &s;ame divine con&s;titution, which is everla&s;ting, and by the &s;ame rule and doctrine of retribution; of nece&s;&s;ity, the word mu&s;t be taken in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as car|rying the &s;ame duration to the righteous and wicked: and for other rea&s;ons which have been a&s;&s;igned. The&s;e adduced texts
<PB N="321" REF="019737_0340_0FACA777CFD081F8">
afford no parallel; they do not touch the force of the argument, which remains in its full &s;trength. But it is &s;trongly objected, if the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words be admited as the mo&s;t pro|per; yet as they are often u&s;ed for an age, and di&s;pen&s;ation, and in a lax, limited &s;en&s;e, and the &s;cripture has taught us this u&s;e of them, it cannot be thought hard and unrea&s;onable &s;o to apply them to the &s;ubjects of the invi&s;ible world, and particu|larly to the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, p. 271, 279. The foundation of this objection is &s;ubverted, by what hath been already &s;aid: but for a more direct an&s;wer, let it be noted (1.) they have never taught us this lax &s;en&s;e, but when the words are applied to the things of this world, to things which we know to be temporary in their nature; or know it by their affixing &s;ome note of time in their de&s;cription: they have never taught us the lax &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words when applied to the &s;ubjects of the invi&s;ible world: we have no in&s;tance, example or warrant for it; and therefore, &s;o to apply them, may well be thought Unwarrantable, and unrea&s;onable. (2dly.) So to apply the words, is contrary to their manife&s;t intention. The in&s;pired teachers certainly intend to teach us the things of the invi&s;ible world, as "eternal" by the force of the&s;e words: and to teach them plainly, forcibly and practically, as of the utmo&s;t impor|tance to mankind, as before ob&s;erved. And in this teaching, they infallibly u&s;e the words in the never-ending &s;en&s;e; for they cannot be taught in any other. It is of no weight to &s;ay, they are often u&s;ed in the lax &s;en&s;e as applied to the things of this world; and when &s;o applied, they have not the &s;ame force as the word "eternal." For let them be ever &s;o often u&s;ed in the lax &s;en&s;e applied to temporary things, yet when improved to teach us "eternal things," the never-ending &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be fixed. For in the lax, limited &s;en&s;e, eternal things can no more be taught of the invi&s;ible, than pre&s;ent world. The moment there|fore, they intend to teach us eternal things, the limited &s;en&s;e is dropped, and the never-ending &s;en&s;e is infallibly fixed. Where|fore, as they plainly and abundantly teach us the things of the invi&s;ible world, as "eternal;" and by that view of them, to form us to practical godline&s;s: and as we know nothing in the nature of tho&s;e things to limit the &s;en&s;e, and they have given us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> note of limitation to any of the &s;ubjects of the future world,
<PB N="322" REF="019737_0341_0FACA77861BA3760">
as they doubtle&s;s would had they been temporary (for it is im|po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould know it, without &s;uch direction): we are therefore nece&s;&s;itated, always to take the&s;e words in the never-ending &s;en&s;e, as applied to the &s;ubjects of that world. And to apply the limited &s;en&s;e, to any of the &s;ubjects of that world, in an arbitrary way, without warrant and again&s;t their manife&s;t in|tention, is unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd. Again, (3dly,) &s;o to ap|ply the words, is contrary to the nature of the &s;ubject and to the con&s;titution of things in the invi&s;ible world, which is "eter|nal." We know all things in this world &s;tand upon a tempo|rary con&s;titution; but the things of the invi&s;ible world are upon one that is "eternal." This difference of con&s;titution between the two worlds, is taught generally, throughout revelation; but expre&s;sly by Paul, 2 Cor. 4. 18. "for the things that are &s;een are temporal (temporary), but the things which are not &s;een, are "eternal." Here he de&s;ignedly teaches us, the grand di&s;tinction in the nature and con&s;titution of things, in this and the future invi&s;ible world, in point of duration; the one tem|porary, and the other eternal. And this fixes the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words as applied to the things of each world, with ea&s;e and certainty&punc; the limited &s;en&s;e to all things in this world, and the never-ending &s;en&s;e to all things infallibly, in the invi&s;ible world. Now to transfer limited, temporary ideas to things, upon an eternal con&s;titution, is directly contrary to the nature of the &s;ubject. It &s;inks our apprehen&s;ions of them, infinitely below their true nature, weight and importance; and it is ab&s;olute confu&s;ion, in the nature of the thing: as truly &s;o, as it would be in treating of colours, to &s;ay, a blue-red, a crow-white and a &s;now-black: as much confu&s;ion in nature and far wor&s;e, than "the yoking an ox and a&s;s together," forbidden by the law of Mo&s;es. Certainly, the in&s;pired teachers from God, never taught the grand doctrines of the invi&s;ible world, the mo&s;t important and influencing in all chri&s;tianity, in &s;uch &s;ceptic confu&s;ion, as to leave every man to fix what &s;en&s;e upon their words, they fan|cied: no, they taught them as eternal, with great di&s;tinctne&s;s and clearne&s;s, as we &s;ee in this in&s;tance, that they might be &s;o received with undoubted certainty; and have a commanding influence over the hearts and lives of men. It is ab&s;urd another way, becau&s;e (4thly.) the annexing ages and di&s;pen&s;ations to
<PB N="323" REF="019737_0342_0FACA77921A6EDE0">
the terms, applied to the things of the future world can an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, but to embarra&s;s and perplex the &s;ubject; for except the impropriety of it, the &s;ubject is as ab&s;olutely &s;ecure on the ground of that con&s;truction, as in that which is mo&s;t common, rational and proper. It can avail them nothing, becau&s;e the &s;tate of the &s;ubjects and the character of the di&s;pen&s;ations, are &s;o infallibly fixed; that the never-ending &s;en&s;e of the&s;e ages and di&s;pen&s;ations, both to the righteous and wicked, in the future world, is ab&s;olutely unavoidable. We know by the con&s;titu|tion of the go&s;pel, and the final &s;entence, that the &s;tate of the righteous and wicked in that world, is ab&s;olutely fixed: the one in happine&s;s, the other in torment. And the character of the di&s;pen&s;ations are likewi&s;e fixed; to the one, reward and happine&s;s; to the other, wrath and puni&s;hment: and the&s;e ages and di&s;pen&s;ations are without end to both; as la&s;ting as their immortality. For there is nothing in the con&s;titution of that world, as there is in this, to limit them: and there is no note of limitation affixed to any of the things of that world; but we are expre&s;sly taught, they are "eternal." And the &s;tate of the &s;ubjects and character of the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations being infallibly fixed, in &s;cripture&mdash;the never-ending &s;en&s;e of the&s;e ages and di&s;pen&s;ations becomes ab&s;olutely unavoidable. The "forever," "forever and ever," "eternal," and everla&s;ting of that world, applied to the righteous and wicked, to the happine&s;s of the one and mi&s;ery of the other; if you will improperly expre&s;s it by ages and di&s;pen&s;ations, is without change or end. In&s;pira|tion hath put no bounds or end to it, nor may any creature in heaven, earth or hell, pre&s;ume to do it. The idea of ages and di&s;pen&s;ations in this connexion, can make no alteration in the nature of the &s;ubject; nor infer and make any change in the character and &s;tate of the righteous or wicked: the character of the di&s;pen&s;ation to the one and the other, remains preci&s;ely and ab&s;olutely the &s;ame, from the fir&s;t, throughout their endle&s;s exi&s;tence. Certainly, when the &s;cripture hath &s;o deci&s;ively fixed the future &s;tate of the wicked, in torment; the words ages and di&s;pen&s;ations applied to it, doth not make the lea&s;t advance towards the idea of mercy and re&s;toration: for it is ages and di&s;pen&s;ations of darkne&s;s, wrath and torment &s;till, without end, as it is emphatically de&s;cribed, "and &s;hall be tormented day
<PB N="324" REF="019737_0343_0FACA779E16C6198">
and night forever and ever" without limitation. Yea, the idea of mercy and re&s;toration is ab&s;olutely excluded, in the ages and di&s;pen&s;ations applied to &s;ubjects, who&s;e &s;tate is thus fixed in torment, by an everla&s;ting con&s;titution and the irrever&s;ible &s;entence of the &s;upreme Judge. Nor can it be introduced and &s;uppo&s;ed, but again&s;t the nature of the &s;ubject, and force of all the de&s;criptions of the future puni&s;hment throughout revelation. For in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;criptions, the &s;tate of the &s;ubject and charac|ter of the di&s;pen&s;ation is fixed, and without end. This infers the&s;e ages and di&s;pen&s;ations to be without end: and their never-ending &s;en&s;e is hereby &s;o a&s;certained, as cannot be avoided, but by affixing to them an arbitrary &s;uppo&s;ed &s;en&s;e, in direct con|tradiction to the doctrine taught and imported throughout re|velation. Their con&s;truction cannot be admitted, becau&s;e (5thly.) it is contrary to the great doctrine retribution, taught us throughout revelation; which a&s;certains the limited &s;en&s;e, to all things whatever in this world; and the never-ending &s;en&s;e to tho&s;e of the future world. We have before proved the fu|ture judgment will be final, the &s;entences of the great day irre|ver&s;ible, and the &s;tate of the righteous and wicked will be un|alterably fixed by them, in the future world. This doctrine a&s;certains the limited &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, how often &s;oever they be applied to the things of this world; and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e, to tho&s;e of the future world. The doctrine of future retribution, which is in&s;eparably connected with that of the final judgment, doth with the &s;ame ea&s;e and certainty determine the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words invariably, as applied to the things of this, and the future world. The &s;cripture teaches us but of two worlds, in which mankind have concern; this pre&s;ent, and the future, in|vi&s;ible world. And it abundantly teacheth us, the pre&s;ent world is a &s;tate of probation, trial and di&s;cipline for mankind, and the future world is a &s;tate of retribution, of rewards and puni&s;hments, only. Perhaps there is no doctrine more impor|tant to the kingdom of God, and of greater influence for the good of mankind, for this world and the future, than the doct|rine of future retribution, in its connexions: nor do I know any doctrine more clearly, deci&s;ively and frequently taught in &s;cripture. Our Saviour taught it mo&s;t plainly, and in a variety of parables, mo&s;t forcibly: the prophets taught it, and the a|po&s;tles
<PB N="325" REF="019737_0344_0FACA77AA15FF9D0">
more abundantly: and in truth, this doctrine runs throughout revelation, from the fir&s;t prophecy of Enoch, to the la&s;t chapter of revelation. Indeed, it &s;eems to be a doctrine of nature, written upon the hearts of all men, the future hopes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs of men without, as well as with revelation, bear witne&s;s to it: and perhaps, there is no one doctrine in religion, in which men of all religions, and of the chri&s;tian in particular, have been more unanimou&s;ly agreed, than in this; that the future &s;tates will be a &s;tate of retribution. Catholicks and prote&s;tants, lu|therans, calveni&s;ts, arminians, and in general chri&s;tians of all denominations, have unanimou&s;ly believed, the future &s;tate after the final judgment, would be a &s;tate of retribution. Now this important &s;cripture doctrine of retribution, gives us an ea&s;y due with certainty to determine the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, as applied to things of this, or the future &s;tate and world. It in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">allibly fixes a limited &s;en&s;e to them, when u&s;ed to &s;ignify an age, or ages, and di&s;pen&s;ations in this world; and &s;o when ap|plied to the hills and mountains, and to the earth it&s;elf: in &s;hort in every ca&s;e, where applied to the things of this &s;tate and world. Becau&s;e, from the nature of the thing, this &s;tate of probation and di&s;cipline mu&s;t and will come to an end; to make way for a future judgment, and to give place to a &s;tate of retribution. And all things pertaining to it will come to a period in the end of the world; and the &s;tates of all men be &s;ettled for retribution, in the day of judgment. On the other hand, this doctrine of retribution, fixes the never-ending &s;en&s;e as clearly and certainly, for the invi&s;ible world to come: it determines the final &s;enten|ces to be irrever&s;ible, the &s;tate of the righteous and wicked to be unalterably fixed by them; and the rewards and puni&s;hments to be as everla&s;ting as the con&s;titution, by which they are awar|ded, and as the immortality of the &s;ubjects of them. For, in that world, both good and bad receive in retribution according to the things done in the body in this life, and not according to what may be done in that &s;tate, in reference to any future one, which would confound and de&s;troy the doctrine, as taught in revelation. A &s;tate of retribution that is final, is in the nature of the thing as fixed and endle&s;s as the &s;ubjects of it. The con|trary &s;uppo&s;ition, is a flat contradiction to the nature of the &s;ub|ject, nor can be admitted but by excluding the idea &amp; doctrine
<PB N="326" REF="019737_0345_0FACA77B61685A58">
of retribution, and &s;ub&s;tituting &s;ome other e&s;&s;entially different, in the room of it. So that the limited &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words when applied to things of this, and the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e when applied to tho&s;e of the future world, is ju&s;t as clear and certain, as the doc|trine of retribution; than which, I find none more &s;o, in all revelation. With this key and the other expre&s;sly given by the apo&s;tle, "the things that are &s;een are temporary; and the things that are un&s;een are eternal," the &s;ubject is as ea&s;y as it is important to all men, the unlearned as well as learned. And thus it was undoubtedly taught and received in the days of in|&s;piration: with which argument I &s;hall clo&s;e this part of the di&s;pute. But previou&s;ly I would ob&s;erve, that what hath been offered, will afford a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the &s;everal embarra&s;|&s;ing difficulties &s;ugge&s;ted upon this &s;ubject. It is repre&s;ented as a matter of &s;urprize "the word eternal and everla&s;ting" is &s;o &s;eldom applied to the &s;uture puni&s;hment. It is &s;aid to be but five times u&s;ed in all the new te&s;tament," p. 259. What then? the final de&s;truction, death, damnation and perdition of the wicked, is abundantly taught, and always without end: and it is taught in &s;uch forcible de&s;criptions, literal and figurative, by exemplification, by connexion and contra&s;t, as to exclude all hope and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to them, as hath been &s;hewn. And the doctrine of retribution, fixes the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e of the words &s;o applied, and fixes their &s;tate unalterable, and their puni&s;hment as la&s;ting as their immortality. Nor doth there appear any he&s;itancy or di&s;pute about it in that age, among tho&s;e who believed in a future &s;tate. It is al&s;o &s;aid, there is a very wide difference between happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, reward and puni&s;hment, which makes it proper to under&s;tand the word e|verla&s;ting, in different &s;en&s;es, as applied to the righteous and wicked; according to the different natures of the &s;ubjects, to which they are applied. An everla&s;ting reward, which is the gift of grace, is agreeable to our natural notions of infinite, per|fect benevolence; but everla&s;ting puni&s;hment is with great dif|ficulty to be reconciled, if at all reconcilable with it. And upon this gronnd we may well admit the endle&s;s &s;en&s;e to the one, and a limited &s;en&s;e to the other, p. 285, 6. This idea of the nature of the &s;ubject, &s;eems no &s;olid ground, of forcible argument.&mdash; If the award to the righteous and wicked, &s;tands upon the &s;ame
<PB N="327" REF="019737_0346_0FACA77C22947E48">
everla&s;ting con&s;titution, and is predicated upon the &s;ame ground, the things done in the body," and is by force of the &s;ame un|erring rule of retribution, and the &s;entence be given by an un|erring Judge, to a &s;tate of retribution, in the &s;ame words to both; of nece&s;&s;ity, the &s;ame duration mu&s;t be intended and carried in them. The&s;e things together ought to govern the con&s;truction, and not the nature of the &s;ubject in that very loo&s;e &s;en&s;e of it. It is al&s;o to be noted, the idea of benevolence is not &s;uch a correlate with mi&s;ery and puni&s;hment, whereby alone, the wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s of it can be determined. It is ju&s;tice, and the wi&s;e, great and good ends of government, are the natural correlates with puni&s;hment, by which to determine the nature, degree, and duration of it, with propriety. And our ideas of infinite, immutable holine&s;s, truth and ju&s;tice are as natural, as tho&s;e of infinite benevolence and grace. And the everla&s;ting di&s;play of the one in the divine admini&s;tration, is as natural and rational an apprehen&s;ion and expectation, as that of the other. Con&s;equently, if the wi&s;e ends of government re|quire it, it is no more incon&s;i&s;tent with our natural and ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the true character of God, that he &s;hould di&s;|play everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the puni&s;hment of the wicked, than everla&s;ting grace, in rewarding the righteous. And it may be further noted, that examples of final capital puni&s;hment to the di&s;obedient, may be as nece&s;&s;ary in the government of God, as in tho&s;e of mankind. This &s;eems conceded and argued by the Dr. in his treati&s;e upon the benevolence of the deity, p. 244, 5, 6. and it is fully proved in the many terrible retributions of providence in this world. And no man with force of rea&s;on, nor without great pre&s;umption can pretend to &s;et bounds to the duration of tho&s;e examples, in the everla&s;ting kingdom of God and in the future &s;tate of retribution. So that this argument is of no force, and &s;eems impertinently urged again&s;t the com|mon con&s;truction and doctrine. The argument again&s;t the infinite ill-demerit of &s;in, "becau&s;e the act of a finite creature and from finite pa&s;&s;ions," &amp;c. has in general been &s;ufficiently an&s;wered, in the fir&s;t part. But it is argued, if &s;in be an infi|nite evil, becau&s;e committed again&s;t an infinite God; then all &s;inners mu&s;t &s;uffer to the utmo&s;t degree, as well as duration. This doth by no means follow. It may on that ground, require
<PB N="328" REF="019737_0347_0FACA77CE1CFF1E0">
an eternal exclu&s;ion from life and heaven and duration of pun|i&s;hment; and yet the degrees of &s;ufferings may be very various, throughout this duration. As we know the natural reproaches and horrors of con&s;cience will be greater in &s;ome than others, and are taught in revelation it will be more tolerable for &s;ome, than others. But there is no difference intimated, in point of duration. Another thing urged is, the &s;mall difference in character between &s;ome of the wicked and &s;ome of the good, which is undi&s;cernable by men, and cannot lay a foundation for &s;uch an amazing difference between them in the future world, p. 320, 321. to which I would reply: there is certainly an e&s;|&s;ential and infinitely important difference between accepting and rejecting the go&s;pel terms of life; or otherwi&s;e &s;alvation and damnation would not be made to depend, upon it. And al|though we, judging by outward appearance cannot determine it, God who &s;earches the heart can, and doth do it. The rule and terms are unalterably fixed, and the final &s;entence will certain|ly condemn all who refu&s;e life, and neglect &s;o great &s;alvation. And God the righteous Judge, knows infinitely better than we, and his rules are certainly, everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. This objection &s;eems to go rather to the con&s;titution it&s;elf, than to the duration of the puni&s;hment. It faults the con&s;titution for condemning tho&s;e, this author judges ought not to be condem|ned. For if by con&s;titution they ought to be condemned, it is righteous it &s;hould be according to their de&s;ert, and to the puni&s;hment declared, in the con&s;titution. Is is added, "a very great part of tho&s;e, who will be mi&s;erable in the other world, were not, that we know of, incurably &s;inful in this."
<Q>And it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed they &s;hould be con&s;igned to endle&s;s tor|ment without another trial,</Q>
&amp;c. p. 321. Why not? If they &s;inned away their day of grace, they may righteou&s;ly be fore|ver excluded mercy. And if the go&s;pel con&s;titution be ever|la&s;ting, it is clear they mu&s;t be &s;o. To which I would add, incurablene&s;s in wickedne&s;s is not the ground and rule of final, capital puni&s;hment, in the government of God, or of mankind; but it is the ill-de&s;ert of the criminals, and the wi&s;e ends of go|vernment to be an&s;wered, in &s;uch executions. Among men, &s;ome that are &s;o far from irrecoverable, as to be actually reco|vered by repentance, mu&s;t yet &s;uffer capital puni&s;hment, by the
<PB N="329" REF="019737_0348_0FACA77DA1A86CB0">
law of the land. The penitent thief on the cro&s;s, is an in&s;tance of this kind. He mu&s;t &s;uffer death, ju&s;tly, by his own confe&s;|&s;ion; and yet a true penitent. And it would be hard to &s;uppo&s;e there are none penitent, among tho&s;e who &s;hed innocent blood; and yet by the laws of God and man, they mu&s;t die a violent death. So that it is evident among men, incurablene&s;s is not the ground of capital execution, but the ill-de&s;ert of the crimi|nals; and becau&s;e law and ju&s;tice mu&s;t have their cour&s;e upon &s;uch offenders, and the good ends of government, require it. And the &s;cripture rule of retribution fixes it altogether upon ill-demerit, "the evil deeds done in the body," and no where re&s;pecting the future world, upon the &s;tate of the mind, as cur|able or incurable. Incurablene&s;s in the &s;en&s;e objected, ap|pears, not the ground of the future puni&s;hment: for if it was, why were the fallen angels, for the fir&s;t offence, without further trial, ca&s;t out of heaven and con&s;igned to puni&s;hment? All we read is, "they kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own ha|bitation," upon which they were bani&s;hed heaven and the hap|pifying pre&s;ence of God, in a &s;tate of puni&s;hment: in which, they have continued almo&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and years; and are now re&s;erved in everla&s;ting chains, to the judgment day: then to be condemned and de&s;troyed in the everla&s;ting fire prepared for them. This objection &s;eems plainly ill founded, and of no force.</P>
<P>It is further added, "the &s;mallne&s;s of the number of tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;aved in the next &s;tate, ought to be e&s;teemed a weighty argument again&s;t interpreting any texts of &s;cripture, &s;o as to mean ab&s;olutely, eternal mi&s;ery. It is &s;aid, if the next &s;tate be final, but few of mankind comparitively, will be &s;aved. For proof, is cited, Mat. 7.14. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." And the few of mankind that appear to have the &s;cripture cha|racters of life upon them from one age to another&punc; is urged as proof, that few will be &s;aved, if the next &s;tate be final. And if but few be &s;aved in final i&s;&s;ue, then he declaims, "what a &s;trange idea mu&s;t we have of the mercy of the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;o celebrated for its un&s;earchable riches and glory?" The birth of the Saviour is &s;poken of "as glad tidings of great joy to all people," and we &s;ay with great propriety, if it opens a door of &s;alvation to all people of all nations, upon the &s;ame gracious
<PB N="330" REF="019737_0349_0FACA77E634C77F0">
terms, in compliance with which, they may be &s;aved: and if they peri&s;h it is in their own default. "An anthem of prai&s;e was &s;ung by the heavenly ho&s;ts to God, for his good-will to men." And we &s;ay with the greate&s;t propriety "if God &s;o loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever be|lieveth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have eternal life." Nor is it the le&s;s to be celebrated, altho' the unbelieving, in rejecting the terms of life, peri&s;h in their iniquity. But, he &s;ays, the total ruin of &s;uch multitudes appears to him a palpable incon|&s;i&s;tency, with the grace of God exhibited in the go&s;pel. How &s;o? when this grace is exhibited as bringing &s;alvation to men, only, in the way of their compliance with go&s;pel terms, in this &s;tate. He adds, "it is incredible that God &s;hould con&s;titute his Son the &s;aviour of men, and the bulk of them be finally and eternally damned." But why is it more incredible than for God to appear in his glory as the redeemer of I&s;rael out of Egypt, and yet the bulk of that people peri&s;h afterwards in wrath, for their murmurings and rebellion? It is &s;urely credible, "if God hath con&s;tituted faith in Chri&s;t the only way of life for &s;inful man," that he &s;hould put his &s;anction of infallibility and immu|tability upon it: and it is an incredible contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e final unbelievers will be &s;aved out of "the only way of life." It is al&s;o &s;aid to be a gro&s;s reflection upon the Saviour, to &s;up|po&s;e they &s;hould peri&s;h, p. 322, 3, 4. This hath been an&s;wered in a note in the &s;econd part: and the reader may find it obvia|ted in the Dr's an&s;wer to an objection of the like import. See his note, &s;ermons, p. 27, 28. Further, can it be any reflection on the Saviour that he doth not &s;ave tho&s;e who will not come unto him for life; and who cannot be &s;aved con&s;i&s;tently with the go&s;pel con&s;titution? &s;urely it cannot. And this author maintains, p. 342, "that their abu&s;e of what is well de&s;igned and adapted for their good, cannot be con&s;trued as an argument again&s;t the di&s;play of God's grace towards them." And it is equally true, that their con&s;equent &s;ufferings for this abu&s;e, can reflect no di&s;honour upon the grace of God, nor upon the Sa|viour. But more effectually to relieve and remove this diffi|culty, let the&s;e few things be con&s;idered. When "the morn|ing &s;tars &s;ang together, and the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy," to celebrate the glories of creation, was there not good ground
<PB N="331" REF="019737_0350_0FACA77F2EB2AA88">
for it? and &s;hall this celebration be reflected on as groundle&s;s, becau&s;e the devil and his angels fell, and will peri&s;h eternally, in the fire of divine wrath, prepared for them? In no wi&s;e. God's redemption of I&s;rael out of Egypt, is a work much cele|brated in &s;cripture: Did they &s;ing God's prai&s;es for it, at the red &s;ea, without grounds? Doth his cutting off the bulk of the nation in wrath, for their after unbelief and di&s;obedience, reflect di&s;honour upon his character as their redeemer, and upon the glory of this work? By no means. No more doth the future puni&s;hment of the wicked. Again, did God con&s;titute his Son a Saviour, to &s;ave men in their &s;ins, and without their believ|ing on him and coming to him for life? or did Chri&s;t undertake to &s;ave men out of the go&s;pel con&s;titution and way of life? If not, the final perdition of the unbelieving and di&s;obedient can reflect no di&s;honour upon the character of God and the Saviour. Moreover, we have rational, firm ground to hope from &s;cripture prophecies, that in the millennium &s;tate, by the ingathering of jews and gentiles of all nations for &s;o many generations, and &s;o long a period, that a very great, if not the greater part of man|kind, will finally be &s;aved. But whether the greater part or not&mdash;we are po&s;itively taught in the 7th chapter of Revelations, it will be "an innumerable multitude out of all nations, which no man can number." And the &s;alvation of &s;uch a numberle&s;s multitude, will &s;urely illu&s;trate the &s;cheme of redemption, as worthy of God and his Son. Be&s;ides, tho&s;e that peri&s;h, tho' lo&s;t in them&s;elves, are not lo&s;t to the divine government: for, in their &s;ufferings they will mini&s;ter to the &s;upport of the au|thority and government of God: and may &s;erve an important purpo&s;e of everla&s;ting in&s;truction, to the grand moral &s;y&s;tem of the creation; and in that way, promote the great good of it. And further, the few comparatively, that are &s;aved in the ages foregoing the millennium; may &s;erve to illu&s;trate, with pecu|liar lu&s;tre, the &s;overeignty, riches, glory and efficacy of the grace of God, with the all-&s;ufficiency of the Saviour, in &s;aving them, in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a world of corruption, &s;nares and dangers, by which multitudes peri&s;h. This may be tho't a &s;ufficient vindication. But there is another way to an&s;wer and remove the difficulty. If the con&s;titution and admini&s;tration of the divine government be ab&s;olutely perfect: particularly, if
<PB N="332" REF="019737_0351_0FACA77FE1D934F8">
God hath formed an in&s;titution and opened a di&s;pen&s;ation, in his infinite wi&s;dom and grace, well fitted to &s;ave a peri&s;hing world, and worthy of all acceptation: and it is in fact conducted with infinite wi&s;dom and propriety, in all ages &amp; di&s;pen&s;ations; and all that comply with the terms of life and become his obe|dient &s;ervants, &s;hall receive &s;alvation, with eternal glory: and the puni&s;hment of the rebellious, &s;hall &s;erve important purpo|&s;es in the divine government: &s;o that in the &s;ettlement of his kingdom in the great day, glory will redound to God in the highe&s;t: which facts, no believer in revelation can deny; then the character of God, of the Saviour, and of the divine govern|ment, is fully vindicated and exalted in honour; be the &s;aved and lo&s;t in the proportion of it, as it may. It depends not upon this la&s;t circum&s;tance, but a higher view of the &s;ubject, viz. the nature and ends of divine government &s;ub&s;erved; and as being accordingly contrived and conducted, with ab&s;olute perfection. Will any avow, that the wi&s;e legi&s;lators and admini&s;trators of a wi&s;e, righteous and good government among men; are an|&s;werable for all the rebellion, mi&s;chiefs and &s;ub&s;equent puni&s;h|ment and mi&s;ery of di&s;obedient &s;ubjects under it? Shall the di&s;honour be reflected on the wi&s;e managers, and not on the criminals? no one will affirm it. The foundation of this de|clamation then, is &s;and. Or, will any affirm, that criminal &s;ub|jects, may not, con&s;i&s;tently with the highe&s;t wi&s;dom and bene|volence, be puni&s;hed adequate to the demerit of their crimes? if they do, the foundation of all government of God and man is overthrown: and if this cannot be maintained, this declama|tion hath no rational foundation, to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>Let not the wicked dare to encourage them&s;elves from their numbers, that it will avail to open another di&s;pen&s;ation of mer|cy, in the future world. Solomon hath precluded &s;uch a vain hope: "Though hand join in hand (be their confederacy in wickedne&s;s ever &s;o &s;trong, and their numbers ever &s;o great) the wicked &s;hall not go unpuni&s;hed." The righteous God, who hath declared it, is able, is re&s;olved, and will put them down in final puni&s;hment. He hath exemplified it again and again in retributions, already put in execution. Did the num|bers, "legions" of angels that fell, open a new trial, to them? Did the numbers of &s;inners in the old world, and in
<PB N="333" REF="019737_0352_0FACA780A23CD0F8">
Sodom, open a new di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy and further trial to them? by no means. And an unbeliever in the threatnings of Noah, again&s;t the old world; and of tho&s;e by the angels a|gain&s;t Sodom, might have argued as &s;hrewdly, and in &s;ome re&s;pects more forcibly, again&s;t their execution: he might have argued, it is incredible, the infinitely benevolent and good God &s;hould de&s;troy a whole world of his children, rational finite creatures, acting upon finite principles; and &s;ave but a handful in the family of Noah: and when it doth not appear they were all incurably wicked, and might not be recovered by &s;ome means within the compa&s;s of infinite wi&s;dom, power and mercy. So in the other in&s;tance, that he &s;hould con&s;ume &s;uch famous cities and plains, with &s;uch numerous inhabitants; and &s;ave &s;o few in Lot's family only, may be &s;aid to be incredible. And in both in&s;tances it might be further urged, they were in fact in a &s;tate of di&s;cipline, and under a di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy, and the time of general retribution not yet come; and therefore it exceeded belief. But &s;uch ab&s;urd rea&s;onings again&s;t the threat|nings of the God of truth, and the wi&s;e maxims and ends of his government, which are above us and render the execution ne|ce&s;&s;ary, are vanity. And in truth, their numbers and pre&s;ump|tuous &s;ecurity in wickedne&s;s, was &s;o far from &s;creening them, that it ha&s;tened their righteous de&s;truction; by rendering it the more nece&s;&s;ary, for the vindication and &s;upport of the charac|ter, authority and government of God, to &s;et them forth as an everla&s;ting example, of in&s;truction and warning. Now, if the greater part of mankind be not finally &s;aved, which many be|lieve will be the effect of the great in gathering in the millen|nium &s;tate; it is pa&s;t doubt, a far greater proportion of mankind will be &s;aved final i&s;&s;ue, than were found in the above in&s;tan|ces: and yet the argument there from numbers, we &s;ee avails nothing: no more can it in the in&s;tance pleaded for.&mdash; The &s;ubject &s;eems to be taken up, upon too &s;hallow grounds, to have force in it. And it is beyond me to conceive any wi&s;e purpo&s;e to be an&s;wered, by &s;uch an arreignment of the divine character and government to the bar of our feeble rea&s;on, and condemning it upon &s;uch &s;lender grounds and partial views of it: and in truth, appears to have more evil in it, than I chu&s;e to expre&s;s. "The wi&s;dom of this world, is fooli&s;hne&s;s with
<PB N="334" REF="019737_0353_0FACA781634E5C50">
God." In fine, it is plead, "the proper cau&s;e and tendency of evils and &s;ufferings in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, is to do men good in a natural or moral &s;en&s;e, or both: and therefore it is rational to &s;uppo&s;e it to be the object of the future &s;ufferings of the wicked." This is argued from the character of God "as the Father of Mercies," and from this, "a change of the mode and manner of wicked men's exi&s;tence" doth not infer a change in the nature of God, "who is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day and forever." And 'tis the language of mankind, and of all ages, and of the &s;cripture, to &s;peak of God as the univer&s;al Father as well as Governour of men. Whence, it is inferred, he will be a Father to the wicked in the future world, and puni&s;h them, to do them good. And it is &s;aid, no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why it &s;hould not be &s;o, p. 325, 6, 7, 8. The force of this arguing hath been already obviated, in the fir&s;t part, and in the &s;econd where this doctrine of di&s;cipline is confuted. And it may be further remarked, that this &s;tating is partly true and partly fal&s;e, that is, &s;ome of the &s;ufferings of men in this &s;tate, are for their good, but others are not &s;o; and the conclu&s;ion will not follow:&mdash; for (1.) it is not true in fact, in di&s;pen&s;ations of retribution in this world, that the good of the &s;ufferers is the object, but the contrary. And the&s;e are the only in&s;tances wherein, from the parity of the ca&s;es, there can be force in the argument. The inhabitants of the old world were not drowned for their good: nor were the inhabitants of Sodom con&s;umed by fire from hea|ven, for their good: nor were the unbelieving I&s;raelites con|&s;umed in wrath, and excluded the re&s;t in Canaan, by the oath of God, for their good. And the&s;e examples are purpo&s;ely &s;et forth to teach us, that the &s;ufferings of the wicked in the future &s;tate, will not be for their good; but for the &s;upport of the divine authority and government, and for the good of others. So that the&s;e examples are in point, and do in fact, &s;ubvert the ground and take away the force of all the&s;e rea&s;onings. I ob|&s;erve (2dly.) it is not merely a change of the mode and manner of wicked men's exi&s;tence in that &s;tate, that is the &s;ubject in di&s;pute; but they are changed into an e&s;&s;entially different &s;tate, under an e&s;&s;entially different con&s;titution, and to an&s;wer a dif|ferent intention in the government of God, in that world, from what is their &s;tate in this. This is a &s;tate of probation and di&s;|cipline,
<PB N="335" REF="019737_0354_0FACA78222B25300">
wi&s;ely adapted for their good; that of retribution. And we know that di&s;cipline is ab&s;olutely at an end, the mo|ment that retribution and capital puni&s;hment takes place. It is &s;o in this world, and mu&s;t be &s;o in the future. The nature of the &s;ubject teaches it: Why &s;hould it be confounded? there|fore, there is no arguing in their manner, from the one &s;tate to the other. They may as well argue, that in the next &s;tate, the righteous and wicked will live promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, and in a mixed &s;tate of good and evil to both; and will live in families, &amp;c. as they do, and becau&s;e they do &s;o, in this; as to argue on that ground, the &s;ufferings of the wicked will be for their good. For the &s;cripture is not more po&s;itive, that by the con&s;titution of that world, the righteous &s;hall be &s;eparated from all evil, to all good; and the wicked &s;hall be &s;eparated from all good, to all evil; nor our Saviour more expre&s;s, that after the re&s;urrection there is no marrying and giving in marriage; than the in&s;pired teachers are "that there is no more &s;acrifice for &s;in to the wick|ed," and "the death of Chri&s;t &s;hall profit them nothing," "and that they have not any inheritance in the kingdom of God," and therefore, that their future &s;ufferings cannot be for their good and &s;alvation, as they may be in this world.</P>
<P>It is very true, that the nature of God is not changed, by this change of &s;tate to the wicked; but it is as true, that he will con|duct towards them according to the nature and pur&s;uant to the intention of a &s;tate of retribution; and therefore not in the cha|racter of a father, but of a righteous revenger of their di&s;obedi|ence. And becau&s;e he is a God that changeth not, he will be the &s;ame in execution, that he is in threatning. And when he executes their threatned puni&s;hment, they &s;hall have "judg|ment without mercy, and wrath without mixture." And it is his immutability, with their con&s;ignment to a &s;tate of retributi|on, by the force of an unchangeable con&s;titution and &s;entence, that &s;eals their de&s;truction, as unalterable and everla&s;ting. I might add, paternal di&s;cipline and government, certainly is not an adequate in&s;titution and means for the governments, &s;tates and kingdoms of this world: and why &s;hould it be thought &s;o for the infinitely more important kingdom of God? It certainly is not. And this is demon&s;trated to be fact, by the many and terrible retributions of providence in this, as well as the future
<PB N="336" REF="019737_0355_0FACA782E1768740">
world: many in&s;tances of it that are executed by men; and many, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t terrible, executed by the more imme|diate hand of God. Be&s;ides, paternal di&s;cipline extended to the future world, is directly contrary to the &s;cripture exhibition of the moral character of God, as righteous governor and judge: and of his moral government, by wi&s;e laws and con&s;titutions, inforced with the highe&s;t &s;anctions and penalties; and to be &s;et|tled in a final &s;tate of retribution, in connexion with the infi|nitely wi&s;e, holy and good ends of it, taught us. It degrades and &s;inks the immen&s;e Maje&s;ty of God, the infinity of his au|thority, the evil of &s;in, the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of go&s;pel duty and obedience, with the dignity and glory of his everla&s;t|ing kingdom, infinitely below the &s;cripture exhibition of this grand &s;ubject. I might further notice, it is repeatedly &s;ugge&s;|ted as a &s;trange thing, that the common con&s;truction of the&s;e words and the common doctrine &s;hould have been &s;o generally received in the chri&s;tian world, and by the learned as well as others; when as Mr. Whi&s;ton tells us, by &s;earching to the bot|tom it is found to have no foundation in revelation; and bears &s;o hard upon the character of God, as infinitely good. They a&s;cribe it to education, to prejudicate notions, &amp;c. but this can|not account for the reception of it in the ages of in&s;piration, by the jewi&s;h and chri&s;tian church; it mu&s;t come from heaven to them; they were taught it by God. As wi&s;e, learned, pious and penetrating men as the chri&s;tian world can boa&s;t, have been in the common &s;entiment: they &s;aw the u&s;e of the&s;e words &s;ometimes in the limited, as well as endle&s;s &s;en&s;e; and were as much concerned to know the truth, as the&s;e writers can be &s;up|po&s;ed to be. And it is irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, and the whole body of the chri&s;tian church, learned and unlearned (a few &s;ocinians &amp; univer&s;ali&s;ts excepted) perhaps as much as ninety-nine of a hundred of all denomina|tions in the &s;everal ages of chri&s;tianity, &s;hould receive the com|mon con&s;truction and doctrine, upon prejudicate notions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps what hath been offered, may &s;hew us the &s;olid grounds and convincing evidence upon which it hath been &s;o generally received. It is manife&s;tly the de&s;ign of the in&s;pired teachers, to teach us the things of the future and invi&s;ible world as "eternal," and to teach them as &s;uch plainly, deci&s;ively and
<PB N="337" REF="019737_0356_0FACA783A2FBB810">
practically; and it is principally by the u&s;e of the&s;e words they do this. And common &s;en&s;e teaches us, that in this u&s;e of them, the never-ending &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be intended by them: for multiply limited ages and di&s;pen&s;ations with what numbers you plea&s;e, they are limited &s;till; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that the idea of "endle&s;s and eternal" can be conveyed by them, but in the never-ending &s;en&s;e. No &s;ooner therefore do we enter into the &s;pirit and views of in&s;pired men, upon this grand &s;ubject, but we &s;ee the never-ending &s;en&s;e affixed to their words: and this is alike plain to the unlearned as learned. Be&s;ides, St. Paul has taught us the e&s;&s;entially different con&s;titution of the two worlds, and given us a deci&s;ive rule for affixing the never-dying &s;en&s;e, to all things in the future invi&s;ible world. "For the things that are &s;een are temporary; but the things that are un&s;een are eternal." In&s;pired men, have not notified us of any &s;ingle ex|ception, as they doubtle&s;s would have done, had there been any exemption and limitation to any of the things of that world. Yea more, they are &s;o far from excepting the future puni&s;hment of the wicked, that all their de&s;criptions of it, literal and figur|ative, by connexion and by contra&s;t, &amp;c. are uniformly and deci&s;ively, without end, as before &s;hewn. Add to all this, they have clearly and abundantly taught us the future general judg|ment will be final; and the &s;ub&s;equent future &s;tate of the righ|teous &amp; wicked, will be a &s;tate of retribution. The&s;e doctrines have appeared mo&s;t indi&s;putably clear and certain, to the body of the chri&s;tian church, in the &s;everal ages of chri&s;tianity. And the&s;e fix the never-ending &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words in the la&s;t &s;en|tence, and as applied to the future &s;tate of the righteous and wicked, with ea&s;e, preci&s;ion, and certainty. For it is &s;elf-evi|dent, the final &s;entence of the great Judge mu&s;t be perpetual; and a final &s;tate of retribution, from the nature of it, mu&s;t be unalterable&mdash;the &s;ame from the fir&s;t moment it commences, during the whole exi&s;tence of the &s;ubjects of it, or throughout their immortality. And wherever the&s;e mo&s;t important doct|rines are taught in the &s;implicity and force, in which they are taught in revelation, they will perpetually inculcate and &s;upport the common con&s;truction and doctrine we contend for, in an in&s;eparable connexion, through all ages of the world. So that in reality there is no wonder in it, that the common con&s;truction
<PB N="338" REF="019737_0357_0FACA7846275FDB0">
and doctrine hath been &s;o very generally received by the chri&s;t|ian world, upon the&s;e and &s;uch like plain &s;cripture grounds. They could do no otherwi&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with &s;cripture, with rea&s;on, and with them&s;elves, in the other important articles of the chri&s;tian faith embraced by them. But the &s;urprize is the other way, how learned men could overlook the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinctions &s;et forth in &s;cripture; and the mo&s;t important doctrines in their nece&s;&s;ary connexions; and &s;o bewilder them|&s;elves and followers in a &s;ubject that &s;tands plain and clear in revelation, in the manner in which it is mo&s;t naturally to be ta|ken up. Perhaps the judicious reader may judge, that Mr. Whi&s;ton and his followers, have been &s;o far from examining the foundation of the common notion to the bottom, as to have been inattentive to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions to clear the &s;ubject; and &s;o as to overlook the true &s;cripture foundation on which the common doctrine doth &s;ecurely and firmly &s;tand. And I can &s;ee no more ground to rely upon Mr. Whi&s;ton's pe|netration and di&s;cretion in this ca&s;e, than in his taking into his creed and cannon of revelation, a number of meer human com|po&s;itions, which have been &s;teadily rejected by the chri&s;tian world, catholic and prote&s;tant. Fanciful men will have their &s;ingularities, but it is &s;ad when they indulge to them in matters of moment, &s;o as to be gro&s;sly mi&s;led by them.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s to the la&s;t argument, to fix the meaning of the&s;e words, viz. the in&s;pired teachers and church of God in&s;tructed by them, under&s;tood the words in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as we do, and not in theirs; and could do no otherwi&s;e: for it is admitted in their own conce&s;&s;ion, their doctrine of re&s;titution was unknown to them. I tru&s;t it hath been clearly already proved, that the Apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians were in the common &s;entiment with us in the&s;e great doctrines, and I take it to be admitted in the note, p. 253. This author adopts the words of Dr. Hart|ley, "po&s;&s;ibly the writers of the old and new te&s;tament did not &s;ee the full meaning of the glorious declarations, which the holy Spirit has delivered to us by their means; ju&s;t as Daniel, and the other prophets, were ignorant of the full and preci&s;e import of their prophecies, relating to Chri&s;t. Or perhaps they did, but thought it expedient, or were commanded, not to be more explicit. The chri&s;tian religion, in converting the various
<PB N="339" REF="019737_0358_0FACA7852125B7C0">
pagan nations of the world, was to be corrupted by them; and the &s;uper&s;titious fear of God, which is one of tho&s;e corruptions, may have been nece&s;&s;ary hitherto on account of the re&s;t. But now the corruptions of the true religion begin to be di&s;covered and removed, by the earne&s;t endeavours of good men of all na|tions and &s;ects, in the&s;e latter times, by their comparing "&s;pi|ritual things with &s;piritual," He adds, "and as knowledge, in other re&s;pects, has been greatly increa&s;ed, it may now be proper that more &s;hould be under&s;tood with reference to the exten&s;ive benevolence of God towards mankind, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than was nece&s;&s;ary in former ages: the &s;upport of chri&s;|tianity may be connected herewith. Perhaps, the amiable light in which it is placed by the above repre&s;entation of it, is the mo&s;t effectual antidote again&s;t infidelity."</P>
<P>By "the full meaning of the glorious declarations" I take to be intended their doctrine of the re&s;toration and &s;alvation of all men, which it is admitted might be unknown to the &s;acred writers: if &s;o, they could not under&s;tand the words in di&s;pute of a limited age or di&s;pen&s;ation, but in the never-ending &s;en&s;e. So that the eva&s;ion given to the la&s;t &s;entence, and to our Savi|our's words, Mark 9th, and other &s;criptures, hath no manner of foundation: for the in&s;pired teachers and writers knew no other "next &s;tate" but that which is eternal. Nor could they under|&s;tand "the mi&s;tery hid from ages" in the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e men: nor heaven and hell in the new earth, as this author doth. That heaven, which is the glorious re&s;idence of God, of the holy an|gels and the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, into which Chri&s;t was received at his a&s;cention, and where he will re&s;ide till the re&s;titution of all things; where he hath directed us to lay up our trea&s;ures, and where the hope, the incorruptible inheritance and crown of good men is laid up and re&s;erved for them, cer|tainly can neither be the aerial heavens which &s;urround this earth&mdash;nor a heaven in an earth to be created, after the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t. And by the phra&s;e "forever and ever," in the revelations of St. John, he could not mean ages and di&s;|pen&s;ations of di&s;cipline, in the re&s;urrection world: nor could Paul have any reference to it in the 15th chapter to the Cor|inthians; for this is all invention to &s;upport the &s;cheme of uni|ver&s;al re&s;toration of which, it is admitted the &s;acred writers
<PB N="340" REF="019737_0359_0FACA785E7CCEF30">
were ignorant. And certainly, they mu&s;t under&s;tand the la&s;t judgment as final, and the doctrine of retribution in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as it hath been commonly received in the chri&s;tian world: and this infallibly fixes the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words for this and the future world, as before &s;hewn. In a word, this conce&s;&s;ion e|very way confirms the common con&s;truction and doctrine; and refutes theirs, as un&s;criptural and delu&s;ive, And were the a|po&s;tles now alive, with the &s;ame in&s;pired &s;entiments and faith, which they embraced and taught, and with which they went down to the grave; could they, in any con&s;i&s;tency with them|&s;elves, but reprobate this &s;trange doctrine, as gro&s;sly erroneous and heretical? The argument as it &s;tands with this conce&s;&s;ion, forms a curious &s;oleci&s;m in logic, and oddity in argumentation. The amount is this, the received con&s;truction and doctrine of the chri&s;tian world upon this &s;ubject, is truly the meaning of the in&s;pired writers; but yet it is not the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of the texts; for the &s;acred writers them&s;elves mi&s;took, and did not &s;ee into the glory of their declarations; but the&s;e &s;harp&s;ighted, unin&s;pired men have penetrated beyond them, into the arcana of revelation, and have found out the mi&s;tical meaning, which be|comes nece&s;&s;ary to be publi&s;hed in this enlightened age, to con|vert infidels. The argument from prophecy &s;eems a &s;lim&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s, as there is not a parity in the ca&s;es to &s;upport the &s;up|po&s;ition. The prophecies of Chri&s;t were de&s;igned to be be&s;t and mo&s;t clearly known in their accompli&s;hment. And there were in&s;pired men then, and living after Chri&s;t to point out their application to him and fulfilment in him, and a&s;certain their meaning with infallibility. (Is this the ca&s;e in this &s;trange doc|trine?) But the plan and true doctrine of &s;alvation, was as nece&s;&s;ary to be clearly under&s;tood and taught in that age, when chri&s;tianity was planting in the world, as it can be in this, or any future age. It was as requi&s;ite then, as now, for the &s;alva|tion of men and the &s;upport of chri&s;tianity, that it &s;hould be taught with undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;implicity and incorrupt integrity, and &s;o that the internal contents of the doctrine, &s;hould render it worthy of all acceptation: (and was certainly &s;o taught by them), for there were "&s;cribes, wi&s;e men and di&s;puters of this world" in that age as well as this, who had as "&s;ceptical a cu|rio&s;ity of examining the doctrines of the bible, and of chri&s;tian|ity,

in order to di&s;cover any flaws and impo&s;itions therein." &s;o that if ever this exotick doctrine was nece&s;&s;ary to be expli|citly taught, it was then; which it is conceded, it was not. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f all doctrine, this, which &s;acrifices the doctrine of the cro&s;s, and renders all chri&s;tianity unnece&s;&s;ary in this world, to final &s;al|vation, cannot &s;upport chri&s;tianity, but ab&s;urdly betrays and &s;ubverts it. This &s;eems but a vain, &s;ham pretence, for undoub|tedly in&s;pired teachers were taught the be&s;t method to &s;upport chri&s;tianity, and their hearts were fully engaged in it. And it is certain they taught the future puni&s;hment, "he that believ|eth not &s;hall be damned" in &s;upport of chri&s;tianity: and it &s;eems here conceded, that it was in the &s;en&s;e commonly received, and "was nece&s;&s;ary hitherto." Who then can have a warrant to contradict them, and condemn this puni&s;hment "as unju&s;t both in the threatning and execution?" or, who hath any right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raign this in&s;pired mea&s;ure to &s;upport chri&s;tianity, of impro|priety and inefficacy, and to &s;ay that it is proper and needful "as a mo&s;t effectual antidote again&s;t infidelity" to be added, that infidels dying in a &s;tate of infidelity &s;hall yet be &s;aved? Hitherto, we have been taught, that the true art of critici&s;ing &s;cripture, con&s;i&s;ts in finding out and exhibiting the in&s;pired meaning of it, and &s;en&s;e of the in&s;pired writers, with clearne&s;s and force: and when this is once effected, the chri&s;tian world were ab&s;olutely concluded by it. But it &s;eems we are now taught a new kind of critici&s;m, in &s;upport of this exotick doct|rine, viz. it is to di&s;card the plain, in&s;pired meaning, and find out a mi&s;tical more glorious one, than the in&s;pired writers were taught or had any knowledge of. Is not this to make the &s;crip|ture a precarious, uncertain rule? May not the wor&s;t of errors and here&s;ies be fathered upon &s;cripture, by deluded men, "as the mo&s;t glorious &s;en&s;e," without a po&s;&s;ibility of detection and confutation? for the eva&s;ion is ea&s;y, "the plain meaning of the in&s;pired writer "may be one thing intended, but it may not be the mo&s;t glorious &s;en&s;e," &amp;c. and if the &s;en&s;e and meaning of the in&s;pired writers doth not conclude us, we are without rule and guide. Is not this new art of critici&s;ing or wre&s;ting &s;crip|ture to a purpo&s;e unde&s;igned by the &s;acred writers, in effect, teaching &s;ceptici&s;m by rule? Can this be connected with the &s;upport of chri&s;tianity? or is this "the mo&s;t effectual antidote

Doth it not directly tend to &s;ubvert chri&s;ti|anity and expo&s;e divine revelation to contempt? for certainly the God of truth, "all who&s;e ways and works are perfect," could never give a revelation to men, the in&s;pired meaning of which, when found, &s;hould be precarious, fallible and uncertain.</P>
<P>This note gives ri&s;e to the&s;e additional queries:&mdash;Is it not ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the in&s;pired teachers and writers did not know the plan and doctrine of &s;alvation in the true and mo&s;t import|ant &s;en&s;e of it; which they were authori&s;ed, and extraordi|narily furni&s;hed to teach the world? Doth not the &s;uppo|&s;ition carry a reflection of di&s;honour upon them, and him that &s;ent them? Is it not an impious pre&s;umption and reflection of di&s;honour, to &s;uppo&s;e, the fear of God taught and encouraged by our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, was a &s;uper&s;titious, (i.e.) a groundle&s;s fear? If they have not taught us the true fear of God, by whom or when &s;hall it be ever taught us? Is not &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion an indirect attack upon the &s;pirit of in&s;piration, and upon their characters as di&s;hone&s;t; "doing evil that good may come of it," and too much to countenance the dei&s;tical, &s;en&s;e|le&s;s cry of prie&s;tcraft? Is it not an ab&s;urd pre&s;umption to &s;up|po&s;e, unin&s;pired men in this day know the &s;cripture plan and doctrine of &s;alvation, better than tho&s;e who were taught it im|mediately by the in&s;piration of God; and better how to time the publication of it to the world, than the in&s;pired writers? Are they wi&s;er in the great things of the kingdom of God, than Mo&s;es, Samuel, Solomon and all the prophets; with our Saviour and all the apo&s;tles? Are they warranted on the ground of this &s;uppo&s;ed extraordinary penetration and in&s;ight into the arcana of revelation, to throw out this exotick doctrine in an age &s;o degenerate, unprincipled and &s;ceptical? Will any judicious chri&s;tian give credit to &s;uch un&s;criptural, enormous claims? Is it not an audacious attempt in &s;uch "Reformers" to undertake to correct and reform the faith of the in&s;pired writers, and their mea&s;ures and motives to &s;upport chri&s;tianity; and to give us "more effectual" ones? Again, is it not admitted in this con|ce&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t implicitly, that we are embracing and defending (in the commonly received con&s;truction and doctrine) the true chri&s;tian and apo&s;tolical doctrine and "faith once delivered to the &s;aints" which we are commanded "earne&s;tly to contend

for;" and that our opponents are oppo&s;ing and &s;ubverting of it with all the ingenuity, art and force they can? con&s;equently, are they not &s;elf-condemned in fathering their doctrine upon the in&s;pired teachers and writers, when it is conceded it was unknown and unde&s;igned by them; and in fact, they taught the contrary doctrine? And can they, con&s;i&s;tently with this conce&s;&s;ion, either teach, write or defend their doctrine, without being &s;elf-condemned? In a word, this note carries in it an antidote again&s;t the reception of their doctrine; as being un|known to the in&s;pired teachers and writers&mdash;certainly be&s;ide their intention&mdash;and when they in fact intended and taught the contrary doctrine, which was nece&s;&s;ary hitherto:" and if nece&s;&s;ary hitherto, it will remain nece&s;&s;ary through all ages of the world. The conce&s;&s;ion in this note, doth by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, every way confirm, the commonly received con|&s;truction and doctrine we contend for, as the faith of the in&s;pi|red writers, which "they once delivered to the &s;aints, which they commanded us to keep, hold fa&s;t, defend and earne&s;tly contend for; and which will be confirmed in the great day, when all contrary error and wickedne&s;s will be condemned. Should any therefore, after this notification, caveat and warn|ing given by our opponents them&s;elves, embrace and hold fa&s;t their un&s;criptural doctrine; will they not &s;in with their eyes open, and be altogether blameable and inexcu&s;able in it? If any &s;hould think there is any thing hard bearing in the&s;e queries and deductions&mdash;to adopt the language of this author on ano|ther occa&s;ion&mdash;I tru&s;t he will acquit me of all blame, on this head&mdash;for if there be any ju&s;t rea&s;on for blame, he mu&s;t blame the authors of this note; for I only exhibit the true contents, and genuine deductions and con&s;equences of it: <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may not be ami&s;s to notice, according to the true &s;pirit of this note, Mr. Whi&s;ton's injudicious cant, upon the topically orthodox, falls with equal force upon the in&s;pired teachers and writers. And it &s;eems this author's charge upon the prote&s;tant world in general (on the ground of their reception of this doctrine of the future puni&s;hment, and &s;ome others in connexion with it) as receiving for &s;acred truths gro&s;s ab&s;urdities, and palpably wrong and di&s;honourable ideas of God; falls alike heavy upon the in&s;pired writers them&s;elves. If &s;o, doth not this evince the faith of the&s;e gentlemen in the matter in di&s;pute to be widely different from that of the in&s;pired teachers? And it &s;eems &s;trange they were not &s;elf-convinced of it. For, it is obvious, our Saviour and his apo&s;tles had no more difficulty of preaching this doctrine of the future puni&s;hment, with freedom, bold|ne&s;s and pathos, than tho&s;e he &s;tiles topically orthodox: and yet this mi&s;|tical &s;cheme was unknown to them; and the&s;e &s;ubterfuges and double in|tenders now thrown out, are inventions which are many centuries too late, to qualify or have any influence upon the preaching of in&s;pired men.&mdash; Whence then, the great difficulty of the&s;e men about it, but from mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ions, or an actual abberration from the true &s;cripture faith? and whence doth this ari&s;e, but from prejudicate notions, fal&s;e maxims, rea&s;on|ings and "vain deceit?" if men, from a prejudicate notion, that this doc|trine is hardly reconcilable with divine benevolence or is unju&s;t, will &s;et them&s;elves to turn and twi&s;t &s;cripture texts every way, to &s;et a&s;ide the doc|trine; in&s;tead of looking into the true foundation on which it is a&s;certained in &s;cripture, and into the rationale of it, whereby it may &s;tand approved to the rea&s;on of man; error is unavoidable.&mdash;Upon peru&s;ing this fa|mous note, I was at no lo&s;s where I &s;hould find our opponents. When the obvious meaning of the &s;acred writers is &s;et a&s;ide, in que&s;t of the ignis fatuus of a more glorious meaning; which, in fact &s;ubverts it, they nece&s;|&s;arily err: ju&s;t as a man that leaves a right path, nece&s;&s;arily takes a wrong one; and the further he goes, the greater the error.</NOTE> which I am

<P>The argument again&s;t univer&s;al &s;alvation from the puni&s;h|ment denounced again&s;t Judas, &s;tands in full force, notwith&s;tan|ding the eva&s;ions here offered, to invalidate it. It is &s;aid to be &s;ufficient to ab&s;olve the meaning of tho&s;e words "good were it for that man if he had never been born," into an aggravated puni&s;hment&punc; without going into a more particular interpretation of them, p. 328, 29. But they are too &s;trong, pointed, and em|phatical, to admit of &s;uch a &s;olution. At this rate, the mo&s;t de&s;criptive and pointed threatnings of God may be eluded, &s;o as never to be literally executed. As well might it be &s;aid, the unbelieving I&s;raelites might enter into Canaan, notwith&s;tanding God &s;wore they &s;hould never enter into his re&s;t. For altho' the puni&s;hment be &s;o de&s;criptively &s;pecified, it may be &s;ufficient to ab&s;olve the meaning of the oath into a heavy puni&s;hment. Can &s;uch a con&s;truction be warranted and honourable to the God of truth? But the chief eva&s;ion is this, the words may be con&s;i|dered as "a prophecy" foretelling that Judas &s;hould practically declare, "by hanging him&s;elf," that to him, in his apprehen&s;ion, it were good he had not been born, had not been brought into being," p. 330, 31. This invented con&s;truction, labours of two difficulties; one is, it hath no countenance in &s;cripture; the o|ther is it &s;tands actually confuted by our Saviour and the apo|&s;tle

Peter. The puni&s;hment denounced in tho&s;e awful words, is not <HI>&s;uicide,</HI> but one that Judas &s;hould &s;uffer, in the future world. For after his decea&s;e, our Saviour &s;peaks of him as "the &s;on of perdition that was lo&s;t," "lo&s;t" to &s;alvation and hope," as under&s;tood in that age, John 17.12. And St. Peter, after the account of his hanging him&s;elf, &s;peaks of him as gone to his own place, no doubt to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment intended by our Saviour in this awful &s;entence upon him, Acts 1.18, 25.</P>
<P>This writer labours hard to make out "the unpardonable &s;in" is pardonable, and that tho&s;e who are guilty of it, may be par|doned and &s;aved. This is a hard ta&s;k, to fal&s;ify the te&s;timony of the faithful and true witne&s;s, and reconcile palpable contra|dictions. Few men would be hardy enough to attempt it, and if it can be done, we expect to &s;ee it effected by tho&s;e who know the glorious meaning of &s;cripture texts, better than the whole chri&s;tian world, and even the &s;acred writers them&s;elves. Our Lord hath declared in the mo&s;t peremptory and ab&s;olute terms, that "bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall not be forgiven," "hath never forgivene&s;s," "&s;hall not be forgiven unto men;" and again, "it &s;hall not be forgiven him neither in this world, neither in the world to come." Did not our Lord, by the&s;e &s;trong, ab&s;olute, peremptory declarations, de&s;ign to put it out of doubt, that &s;uch &s;inners &s;hould never be pardoned and &s;aved? Certainly. And a chri&s;tian may I think, as con&s;i&s;tently attempt to evade and fal&s;ify the truth of the &s;un's &s;hining, when it &s;hines full in his face, as to fal&s;ify the&s;e declarations of Chri&s;t, and maintain that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e very &s;inners may yet be pardoned and &s;aved. There is no art, quibbling, eva&s;ion of &s;ubterfuge whatever, that can elude and fal&s;ify this plain, &s;trong te&s;timony of our Sa|viour "that &s;uch &s;inners &s;hall never be pardoned and &s;aved." And this, if I mi&s;take not, appears in the conce&s;&s;ions of this writer. He concedes, they cannot be pardoned in this world and e&s;cape hell, but mu&s;t undergo the torment of the future world. But it is clear, our Saviour's meaning is not to be li|mited to a pardon in this world; it extends equally to the future world: el&s;e, why doth he expre&s;sly &s;o extend it, and &s;ay, "it &s;hall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor the world to come?" If ever they can be pardoned and &s;aved in the fu|ture world, it fal&s;ifies the declaration of Chri&s;t as truly, as tho'
<PB N="346" REF="019737_0365_0FACA78A62A8D168">
they received an intervening pardon, in this world. Be&s;ides, by go&s;pel con&s;titution there is no forgivene&s;s and &s;alvation to any that go to that place of torment, and by the&s;e &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ions our Saviour de&s;igned at once to cut off all hope of it, to the&s;e bla&s;phemers. The &s;criptures teach us plainly the way to heaven, and in it we e&s;cape hell: but where do they teach us, that the way to it is through hell; and that the&s;e bla&s;phem|ers or any others, &s;hall pa&s;s through the torments of it, into hea|ven? it is as contrary to the tenor of revelation, as any doctrine that can be named. Again, it is conceded, that the&s;e bla&s;phe|mers are "excluded from the go&s;pel privilege of forgivene&s;s," and that "they have no hope from the go&s;pel promi&s;e of for|givene&s;s, becau&s;e they are excepted per&s;ons," p. 335, 6. If &s;o, by go&s;pel con&s;titution they can never inherit heaven; for this inheritance is given, and limited to tho&s;e, who have "go&s;|pel forgivene&s;s," and by "go&s;pel promi&s;e." And if this con&s;titution be the only way of life for &s;inful man," infallibly the&s;e "excepted per&s;ons" can never be &s;aved. To &s;ay, they may yet be &s;aved without go&s;pel forgivene&s;s and promi&s;e, what is it better than infidelity? And is it not a contradiction to &s;ay this &s;cheme of &s;aving men without go&s;pel forgivene&s;s and pro|mi&s;e, is proved by the go&s;pel, to be the go&s;pel plan of mercy? they &s;eem to be gro&s;sly bewildered and entangled by their own &s;ubtlety and &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>It is further conceded, "that this mode of &s;peech was pro|verbial in our Saviour's day: and that when it is &s;aid, "a thing &s;hall not be, neither in this world, neither in the world to come," it was the &s;ame thing with &s;aying, "it &s;hall never be," p. 338. The ground and force of this proverb with the jews, &s;eems to be this: they believed in but two worlds, this, and a future one which is "eternal," in which mankind are concerned: and therefore they could not more forcibly expre&s;s it, "that a thing &s;hould never be, no, not to eternity; than, in this phra&s;e, "it &s;hall not be, neither in this world, nor in the world to come." And doubtle&s;s our Saviour intended it in this very &s;en&s;e, in this application of it. And &s;o the in&s;pired writers under&s;tood it; for they knew nothing of this doctrine of their &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;to|ration. And to &s;uppo&s;e, the&s;e very &s;inners were intru&s;ted to our Saviour to be pardoned and &s;aved; and that he knew and
<PB N="347" REF="019737_0366_0FACA78B21C62228">
intended they &s;hould all be finally pardoned and &s;aved; it &s;eems he could not have applied this proverbial &s;aying to them, but in the way of direct impo&s;ition; which is a bla&s;phemy every chri&s;tian mu&s;t reject with horror. We are nece&s;&s;itated therefore, to take the&s;e &s;olemn declarations of Chri&s;t in the common, ob|vious, popular &s;en&s;e; and they will remain a perpetual and un|an&s;werable confutation of the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Several things are offered, to &s;et a&s;ide the argument again&s;t this impleaded doctrine "from the pernicious bad tendency of it;" &s;ome of which we &s;hall briefly notice. It is &s;aid, "it mu&s;t be plainly &s;hown, that the&s;e doctrines do naturally and directly tend to encourage men in vicious practice," p. 341. Agreed, And this I conceive, hath been clearly and &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, in a variety of ways, in the foregoing pages. It is &s;o obvious at fir&s;t view, that a man needs no &s;mall practice upon him&s;elf, by fal&s;e rea&s;onings, to overcome and &s;tiffle the conviction and &s;en&s;ibility of it. It is &s;o obvious, that &s;ome of his notable wit|ne&s;&s;es, as Origen, Dr. Burnet, &amp;c. had no &s;mall conviction and &s;en&s;ibility of it. And it is a wonder, they had not pur&s;ued their inquiries into the nature and tendency of it, until they were fully convinced it was a doctrine of ungodline&s;s, and could not be of God. The &s;ugge&s;tion, that this doctrine hath not a na|tural bad tendency, is as unphilo&s;ophical, as it is un&s;criptural and contrary to the evidence of fact. For &s;uch is the con&s;ti|tution of human nature in this &s;tate, that the u&s;e of threatning and fear was a requi&s;ite &s;afeguard to man in innocency. And in this degenerate &s;tate, wherein the pa&s;&s;ions of men are &s;o in|ordinate and exorbitant, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the go|vernment of mankind. Thence it is &s;elf-evident, the weak|ening the motive of fear, by taking out the &s;ting and terror of the threatning, and by adding the encouragement of life, to the refractory and di&s;obedient, hath both ways, a natural and mo&s;t pernicious tendency to promote vicious practice. And it was a well grounded fear ari&s;ing hence, founded in the nature of things (and not a &s;uper&s;titious one) that made Origen, Bur|net and others who were deluded into the doctrine, afraid to open it to the world, on account of the pernicious con&s;equen|ces of it. And it is a plain fact, that the &s;upplanting the belief of the threatning, accompanied with an encouragement of life
<PB N="348" REF="019737_0367_0FACA78BE2F01398">
to the di&s;obedient, &s;educed our fir&s;t parents into rebellion: and a pre&s;umptuous hope of future peace encourages and har|dens men in &s;in, and is many ways of mo&s;t pernicious con&s;e|quence, as already &s;hewn. I conceive, the bad tendency of the doctrine every way, hath been abundantly proved; and the argument is forcible and conclu&s;ive. It is al&s;o argued, the common doctrine is not &s;o likely to re&s;train men from &s;in, as this impleaded doctrine.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 352, 3.</NOTE> Why not? If believed and reali&s;ed, in its importance, it mu&s;t have the greate&s;t influence; for the weight of the motive in the common view, exceeds the other, as eternity doth time. And unle&s;s motives are realized, they cannot have influence, on any &s;cheme. And this is the true rea&s;on, why the great go&s;pel motives of life and death both, have no more influence upon many who a&s;&s;ent to them as the truths of God; becau&s;e they do not realize them, in their infi|nite importance. It is &s;aid, "the natural notions they enter|tain of the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to it, and &s;trongly operate to ob&s;truct its influence." If by "natu|ral" be meant "ju&s;t and true &s;entiments of the goodne&s;s and mercy of God," it mu&s;t be mi&s;take; for the&s;e are regulated by &s;cripture: and it is certain, that &s;criptural apprehen&s;ions of the mercy of God, cannot ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition, and ob&s;truct the influence of the divine threatnings. It mu&s;t then be fal&s;e and pre&s;umptuous notions of the divine mercy, un&s;upported by any &s;cripture promi&s;e, and &s;upplanted by many divine threatnings, that hath this ob&s;tructing influence. And whether the drawing the mo&s;t awful &s;cripture threatnings into di&s;pute, and denying them, in the mo&s;t plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of them, doth not tend to confirm and harden men in the&s;e pre&s;umptuous notions, and thereby to ob&s;truct the &s;alutary influence of the threatnings of God, may not be unworthy the attention of our opponents. &mdash;It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, upon their &s;cheme "there is nothing in|credible in the torments of another world." To me it appears the very rever&s;e. This &s;cheme of di&s;cipline, purgatory, new-created worlds, tran&s;mutation &s;tates, means of &s;alvation more effectual than the go&s;pel, &amp;c. &amp;c. appears wholly anti&s;criptu|ral, and pregnant with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of ab&s;urdities: and this I tru&s;t hath been fully evinced. What are the objected difficul|ties to the common &s;cheme, compared with the numerous pal|pable,
<PB N="349" REF="019737_0368_0FACA78CA14E5248">
horrible ab&s;urdities of this? they are light as a feather. What if we, &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures, cannot &s;ee how this pun|i&s;hment is con&s;i&s;tent with the mercy and ju&s;tice of God? It is certain no man can prove it incon&s;i&s;tent with the one or the other, notwith&s;tanding the confident declamation of Mr. Whi|&s;ton and &s;ome others. And what mighty difficulty is there in acknowledging "God is incomprehen&s;ible in his ways and works?" Are there not a thou&s;and difficulties that we cannot &s;ee through in the kingdom of nature and providence and in revelation, where the evidence of truth and facts arre&s;ts and commands our belief? What if we cannot &s;ee and exhibit the rationale of this doctrine to &s;atisfaction, perhaps others can? And what if no man either hath or can do it? yet, as God is incomprehen&s;ible, and his ways and thoughts not as ours, but infinitely above them: and as we know by rea&s;on and revela|tion all the affairs of his everla&s;ting kingdom will be adju&s;ted in ab&s;olute wi&s;dom and perfection, with the concurring har|mony of all his perfections: &s;ince, he hath deci&s;ively revealed this doctrine of the future puni&s;hment, his authority ought ab|&s;olutely to command and conclude our belief. And unle&s;s it doth &s;o conclude us in the articles of the chri&s;tian faith, what claim have we to be chri&s;tians and prote&s;tants? It is added, "the future torments, con&s;idered in the light of this impleaded &s;cheme, are more &s;uitably adapted, in the nature of the thing, to work upon rational and intelligent agents, than in the com|mon point of view," p. 357. I &s;hould be &s;orry if it was true in fact, that motives &s;ugge&s;ted by unin&s;pired men, &s;hould be better adapted "in the nature of the thing" to excite &s;inners to faith and repentance, than tho&s;e taught us by in&s;pired men of God: becau&s;e it tends directly to bring divine revelation and the doctrine of in&s;piration into contempt. And to father this doctrine upon the in&s;pired writers, when it is conceded they were ignorant of it, affords no relief in the ca&s;e, but makes bad wor&s;e: whence ari&s;es a violent pre&s;umption, previous to parti|cular examination, that this is of a piece with the re&s;t of the &s;cheme, "but vain deceit." It is &s;aid, "the end propo&s;ed by them perfectly coincides with benevolence; for they are the cha&s;ti&s;ements of a father, as well as judge, and principally de|&s;igned for the reformation, and con&s;equent good, of the offen|ders

The remark is this, the true and full force of this motive is, upon the common &s;cheme, u&s;ed with &s;inners in this world. They are warned of this place of torment, and warned of it by their Father and compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer, and it is for their repentance and con&s;equent good: and they are taught, this puni&s;h|ment will be in proportion to their de&s;ert, and that they cannot e&s;cape it and have mercy, till they are humbled and &s;ubdued; and the end propo&s;ed, perfectly coincides with benevolence: and yet this "be&s;t calculated motive po&s;&s;ible," proves ineffec|tual to thou&s;ands and millions. What is the con&s;equence, but de&s;truction to their &s;cheme? two ways: one is, it fully confutes their doctrine of more effectual future means: for if the be&s;t calculated po&s;&s;ible motives, to operate upon them in a rational moral way, be u&s;ed with them in this world, it is a contradiction to &s;ay, better and more effectual ones will be u&s;ed with them in the future. The other way is, the force of di&s;cipline is tried upon them in vain, in this world; and therefore their re&s;toration in a future one is a hopele&s;s, de&s;perate affair. For if they are to be recovered in a rational, moral way, and the be&s;t calculated motives to operate this way, po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, have &s;pent their force on them in vain; their recovery by any means and motives whatever becomes ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s. So that their new created, re&s;urrection world, ages of ages of di&s;ci|pline, tran&s;mutation &s;tates, and more effectual means for the re&s;toration of the wicked, turn out again, it &s;eems, upon their own &s;cheme, to be but invented fancies, and deceitful delu&s;ions. Men are ea&s;ily en&s;nared and confounded in their own devices and works, when they attempt to correct the faith of in&s;pired writers, and new model the doctrine of the go&s;pel as they ima|gine to greater con&s;i&s;tency and force. "The fooli&s;hne&s;s of

God, is wi&s;er than men." But to the que&s;tion, what is wanting in a motive, &s;o circum&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon their &s;cheme? I &s;hould &s;ay, it wants every thing, for it wants credibility and a foundation; and hath none in &s;cripture or rea&s;on. It wants three things of moment, to name no more. (1.) It wants the authority of God to enforce it upon the heart and con&s;cience. He hath never taught us, the wicked &s;hall be damned for their good: it is mo&s;t contrary to the tenor of &s;cripture, and ab&s;urd to the rea&s;on of man. It wants, (2dly.) and cannot bring with it, that pre|&s;ent heart-felt nece&s;&s;ity to turn and live, which is requi&s;ite to &s;pring the effectual exertions of habituated &s;inners; and with|out which, they will never be exerted. The nece&s;&s;ity I mean, ari&s;es from this double conjoint view of their ca&s;e, viz. they have no other alternative of choice before them, but life or death, everla&s;ting life or damnation; infallibly following their choice and exertions of good or evil: and that they have no other chance of opportunity, of this choice, but the pre&s;ent life. To impre&s;s the conviction and &s;en&s;ibility of this ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of a pre&s;ent turning for life, this only alternative of choice of life or death, in this only &s;ea&s;on of opportunity, are abun|dantly taught and urged by the in&s;pired teachers and writers; and with a view to excite and &s;timulate pre&s;ent choice and ef|fectual exertions. Here the que&s;tion comes with an irre&s;i&s;ta|ble force of conviction, what complex motive can po&s;&s;ibly be better adapted or more forcible to the purpo&s;e? for the highe&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t motives in nature, and eternity, are conjoined with this &s;hort, uncertain, only &s;ea&s;on of opportunity;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The attentive reader will ob&s;erve, this writer labours the point, page 344, 5, 6, to prove, that although the di&s;couragement to &s;in, and motives were much greater upon the common &s;cheme, than his; yet, the argument would not be forcible&mdash;but in the two la&s;t in&s;tances, the motives being more &s;uitably adapted, and even "in the nature of the thing" to operate with greater force, is u&s;ed as an argument to &s;upport and recommend his &s;cheme.

the choice and effectual exertions connected with it, are by far too numerous to be referred to. We have this only alternative of choice, in the addre&s;s of Mo&s;es, "I have &s;et life and death before you, choo&s;e life that ye may live:" and again, "it is not a vain thing to &s;erve the Lord, it is your life." And repeatedly in the prophets, "turn and live," "turn ye, turn ye, why will you die?" And in the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion, the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t mu&s;t addre&s;s this only alternative, to enforce the reception of the go&s;pel. "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." "He that believeth hath everla&s;ting life, but he that believeth not &s;hall not &s;ee life." "Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h," &amp;c. And the only &s;ea&s;on of opportunity in this life, is plainly and forcibly taught, in divers parables of our Saviour, in the argument of Solomon, "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, device or knowledge in the grave whether thou goe&s;t." And in the words of Chri&s;t, "the night cometh, wherein no man can work."&mdash;In the addre&s;s of the apo&s;tle, "Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation." "While it is &s;aid, "to day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, &amp;c.

And this only alternative of choice, is no where inculcated with greater force, than by our Saviour in the di&s;puted pa&s;&s;age in Mark 9th, to impre&s;s the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;ent cutting off darling lu&s;ts&mdash;this mu&s;t be done in this life, or their fate is inevitable, &mdash;What is it? they cannot enter into the kingdom of God, but mu&s;t "be ca&s;t into hell, where the fire will never be quench|ed and their worm &s;hall never die." The turn they give to this text, to elude the doctrine and alternative taught in it, doth directly contradict, oppo&s;e, and defeat the force of the motive, as de&s;igned by our Saviour.

e&s;cape hell and attain everla&s;ting life, than in their point of view? it would be an impo&s;ition upon any reader, to &s;uppo&s;e him &s;o defective in under&s;tanding, and in mental and moral feelings, as to he&s;itate, in &s;o plain a ca&s;e. And in truth, con|&s;idering the &s;trong bias there is in degenerate nature, to put off the work of repentance to a future &s;ea&s;on, I &s;ee no ground of hope that &s;inners accu&s;tomed to do evil "would ever be wrought up to effectual exertions by their motive, of perpetu|ating their opportunity in a &s;tate of damnation, for ages of ages after the judgment, without any known period. There is the &s;tronge&s;t probability, the hope of future opportunity and a better &s;ea&s;on, would perpetually elude, ob&s;truct and prevent effectual exertions even to eternity, were not the doctrine o|therwi&s;e gro&s;sly ab&s;urd. And undoubtedly the motive in all its force in the common point of view, is highly nece&s;&s;ary; or it would not have been &s;o &s;trongly inculcated in &s;cripture, e&s;pe|cially by our Saviour, and by him made the &s;pecial duty of his mini&s;ters to inculcate this mo&s;t alarming alternative, in all ages of the world.</P>
<P>Their motive hath a third defect, full as great as the others, viz. it wants the great encouragement of the ble&s;&s;ing and effec|tual grace of God to attend it, and render it effectual. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, his go&s;pel is the power of God to the &s;alvation of men. And we have abundant encouragement, from the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, the gracious de&s;ign of the in&s;titution it&s;elf, and the method of &s;alvation plainly revealed in the go&s;pel, that where the doctrines of it are preached in their genuine purity and &s;implicity, and the motives of it in their true force; an effectual ble&s;&s;ing will attend it, for the good and &s;alvation of men. For the great ble&s;&s;ing of &s;alvation, comes by faith, and faith by the word of God, and the word of God by them that are &s;ent, Mark 16.16. and Rom. 10.14, 15, 17. But can any man rationally expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God to attend this muti|lated, perverted go&s;pel? where the main force of the promi&s;es and threatnings, and of the doctrine of retribution and of the la&s;t judgment are extracted and taken away, by ill-grounded, deadening critici&s;ms? where the &s;pirit and force of the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion, in the expre&s;s language of it, is eluded, and the re|wards and puni&s;hments are cut &s;hort from everla&s;ting, to an

age or limited ages in the la&s;t &s;entence? Will God &s;et his holy &s;eal and give his ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch a doctrine of corruption and di&s;honour, that ca&s;ts infinite contempt upon the true go&s;pel; by teaching, in effect and true con&s;truction, that "the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s forever" is more effectual for the good and &s;alva|tion of men, than all the light and grace of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t? It &s;urely "exceeds all belief," however the motive may be mo|dified "by the wi&s;dom of man." So that "the motive circum|&s;tanced as in their &s;cheme" cannot be &s;teadily and firmly be|lieved, to give it operation and efficacy; for the fir&s;t rea&s;on&mdash; becau&s;e there is no firm foundation for faith to re&s;t upon:&mdash;it is inadequate in force, for the &s;econd&mdash;and no good can be expected from it&mdash;nothing but evil, for the third rea&s;on.&mdash; This may &s;erve in part, for an an&s;wer to another argument &s;ug|ge&s;ted to recommend this impleaded doctrine and excu&s;e its publication to the world, viz. "the public officers of religion might be more free and full in urging the doctrine of the future puni&s;hment, on their &s;cheme, than the common one, and be likely to do a great deal more good," p. 354, 5, 6. There can be no force in this &s;ugge&s;tion, if what we have argued be true, that their notion wants credibility and force, and no good can be expected from it, either from the adapted force of the motive it&s;elf, nor from the ble&s;&s;ing of God. It is plead, tho&s;e who do not believe the common doctrine, might upon their plan, teach the future torment to good purpo&s;e. Not, if their plan was unknown to the &s;acred writers, and is but a mutilated pervert|ed go&s;pel; the teaching it mu&s;t do hurt and no good. What good can be done by teaching the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer an age of torment, then die the &s;econd death, and then if &s;tubborn, may die again and again? By what law, can this death again and again (after the &s;econd death) be &s;entenced and executed upon them? by no known law of God, of rea&s;on, or revelation, for this teaches only the fir&s;t and &s;econd death: it mu&s;t be then a romantic, &s;ceptical fancy; and can the teaching this to the world, do good? a man of good &s;en&s;e, unperverted by theory, may as well &s;wallow fire, as to take &s;uch an anti&s;criptural, &s;cepti|cal, ab&s;urd notion into his creed. Be&s;ides, what right hath any man to take upon him a commi&s;&s;ion, which he cannot execute with a good con&s;cience, according to the true &s;pirit, language,
<PB N="355" REF="019737_0374_0FACA79122DBFEF8">
import and intention of it? Can a man hone&s;tly accept the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;upreme judge, in capital ca&s;es of life and death, who&s;e mind is perverted by the doctrine of paternal di&s;cipline into a full belief, that no capital executions by men whatever, are lawful? when he mu&s;t either violate his con&s;cience in the execution of his office; or, di&s;appoint the righteous expectati|ons of God and man from him, by refu&s;ing to pa&s;s the &s;entence of death, upon every murderer that &s;tands convicted before him? Can a man with any more hone&s;ty, undertake to exe|cute the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion, who cannot pronounce that &s;en|tence in it "he that believeth not &s;hall be damned," without this e&s;&s;ential alteration and addition to it, viz. "and yet he may and &s;hall be &s;aved?" If it be demanded, who hath requi|red this alteration and addition at your hands? will it &s;atisfy a judicious chri&s;tian, or avail with the Judge in the great day, to &s;ay, we thought it a more glorious meaning than our Savi|our meant when he gave it, and than the apo&s;tles under&s;tood when they received it, and therefore ventured to add it? Nor hath this plain point in morality yet been proved, that a man may hone&s;tly and rightfully eat the bread of <HI>orthodoxy,</HI> and yet lay wa&s;te the faith it is given him to &s;upport and enforce. It &s;eems requi&s;ite in the nature of the thing, that the&s;e difficulties &s;hould fir&s;t be removed, before this argument can be urged upon us with propriety and force.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Dr. in his "Sea&s;onable thoughts," hath given his &s;entiments very different from this writer. In p. 245, he tells us, "Men vi&s;ibly un|found in the faith, &s;hould, upon no terms, be admitted into the mini&s;try:" and if it appeared afterwards, "they ought to be turned out of it." And page 337, 8, it is the &s;pecial duty of mini&s;ters to guard their people again&s;t the bad influence of all error, in principle and practice. And when it ap|pears, "now is the time they are particularly called to &s;tand up for the good old way," and bear a faithful te&s;timony again&s;t every thing that may tend to ca&s;t a blemi&s;h on true primitive chri&s;tianity." And again, p. 349, "to be &s;ure, tho&s;e ought to do &s;o, in a particular manner, who in&s;tead of guarding people again&s;t error and evil practice, have unhappily been the in&s;truments of leading them into it." This coun&s;el of the Dr. appears to me incomparably &s;afer and better than to encourage the fatal attempt of "doing a great deal of good" upon a plan of doctrine unknown to the &s;acred writers: and of a vi&s;ible pernicious tendency.</NOTE></P>
<P>As to the argument from the pious good tendency of this impleaded doctrine; the contrary hath been repeatedly &s;hewn. As to that page 336, that it is &s;ingularly forcible to induce

meekne&s;s, patience, contentment and re&s;ignation under the trials of this life&mdash;it is un&s;criptural&mdash;it is far fetched&mdash;and far better adapted arguments may be deduced from &s;cripture upon the common &s;cheme: and indeed the argument as there &s;tated, &s;eems rather calculated to fortify and harden men a|gain&s;t the fear of future de&s;truction, than to do them any real &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent life.</P>
<P>I have now done with the eva&s;ions and additional arguments to &s;upport and commend the impleaded &s;cheme; and tru&s;t they are &s;ufficiently confuted. And it is al&s;o plainly &s;hewn, that "it tends to deceive unwary &s;ouls, and turn them a&s;ide from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel;" on which ground we have the concurring wi&s;h of the author him&s;elf, with our own, "that it may meet with no acceptance in the world."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Preface, p. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>To conclude, notwith&s;tanding all "the good words and fair &s;peeches," &s;ubtle critici&s;ms, in&s;inuations and plau&s;ible preten|tions of every kind, employed upon the &s;ubject, upon a careful examination, we find not a &s;ingle rational argument to induce any man to credit this doctrine, and much le&s;s to inculcate it, but very many again&s;t it. It is certain, the common faith of the chri&s;tian world, in the age of in&s;piration and ever &s;ince, is incomparably better fitted and more forcible (than this &s;trange tenet) to &s;upport the authority and government of God, to inforce the requi&s;itions of the law and go&s;pel, to advance the Redeemer's intere&s;t in the world, to promote the be&s;t welfare of church and &s;tate, of families and individuals, and particular|ly to re&s;train &s;inners from &s;in, and &s;timulate them to repentance, and to edify, &s;upport and animate good men in the chri&s;tian life. And therefore is far more worthy of God, and of all ac|ceptation of men. Whence were the tran&s;porting, un&s;peakable joys of the martyrs, from Saint Stephen through all the ages of martyrdom, but from a near, lively view of the things of the invi&s;ible world, "as eternal," without any reference to the temporary things of the new earth world, as now taught? It is certain, this impleaded doctrine, in &s;ubverting the common faith, can do no good, for rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned: and whe|ther it be not more likely to be followed with a bla&s;ting cur&s;e, than pro&s;perous ble&s;&s;ing, the reader will judge. Again, it is certain, the common faith can do us no hurt: we run no ri&s;quo
<PB N="357" REF="019737_0376_0FACA792A14BF8B8" MS="y">
in receiving it, and practi&s;ing agreeable to it. For if all men &s;hall be &s;aved, we are as &s;afe, and &s;hall be &s;aved, as well as they. On the other hand, the hazzard is certainly infinitely great: for if the common faith delivered to the &s;aints, by in&s;pired men of God, be confirmed in the great day, as undoubtedly it will; and yet we tru&s;t to this impleaded faith, and neglect the great &s;alvation, we are unavoidably and everla&s;ting ruined. Now, can any man, who is not lo&s;t to rea&s;on and mental &s;en&s;ibility, he&s;itate, which is the better faith, and which is the wi&s;e&s;t and &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e? Mu&s;t not men act "in defiance of all rea&s;on and intere&s;t" to credit and rely upon this impleaded faith, in this contra&s;ted view? But if this impleaded doctrine be no good to us, nor as taught to the chri&s;tian world, yet it hath another argument to recommend it which is repeatedly urged, "that it is well adapted and may be requi&s;ite, to convert dei&s;ts. If &s;o, I &s;hould think it mu&s;t be on &s;uppo&s;ition, of a predi&s;po&s;i|tion in the dei&s;ts to believe in all unbelief; and therefore the more &s;ubtle and ab&s;urd, the more credible. For this plan is &s;o ab&s;urd, romantick and incon&s;i&s;tent in the parts, that I &s;ee not how they could be taken in, any other way. The argu|ment goes on the &s;uppo&s;ition; they want more forcible addre&s;s of rea&s;on, than they have yet had; which I take to be a mi&s;take in fact. The excellency of the doctrines and in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity, have been repre&s;ented to them, in an amiable and engaging view; and the external evidences to confirm it, hath been &s;et in a clear light before them, as noon-day, by the many able defenders of it, clergy and laity, within a century pa&s;t: they can't therefore want addre&s;s to rea&s;on, and yet they are unreduced. Why? It is the doctrine of the cro&s;s, is their grand difficulty. They are &s;o addicted to their vain amu&s;ements, and infatuated with worldly and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, that they cannot part with the&s;e, for trea&s;ures in heaven. What is the true remedy? This plan &s;ays, complement them with the giv|ing up of the cro&s;s to them, as unnece&s;&s;ary in this world, to their final &s;alvation. They may indulge their plea&s;ures, be purged by fire in the future &s;tate, and be &s;aved. This labours of great difficulty: the doctrine of the cro&s;s is committed in tru&s;t to us, to believe, practi&s;e, teach and enforce. To give it up, is a &s;pecies of trea&s;on in us, again&s;t the great Lord of the <PB N="358" REF="019737_0377_0FACA79362E92A10">
kingdom. After this treachery, they cannot tru&s;t in any plan, as a &s;ub&s;titute, that we can offer them. Be&s;ides, it can do them no good: for if they become nominal chri&s;tians, without taking up the cro&s;s, which they are &s;o taught to be unnece&s;&s;ary, they mu&s;t &s;uffer damnation, as &s;urely, as if they had remained dei&s;ts. And what is wor&s;t of all, is, we put into their hands and furni&s;h them with a &s;tronger argument again&s;t revelation, than all in|fidelity ever hath, or can produce. They would certainly turn the argument upon us, thus&mdash;if by go&s;pel con&s;titution, faith in Chri&s;t, repentance towards God, and the taking up the cro&s;s and following Chri&s;t in go&s;pel holine&s;s, in this life, be not ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;alvation of men; there is no certainty in any thing, in the go&s;pel revelation. And it is certainly, incon&s;i&s;tent with all our ideas of the perfections of God, that he &s;hould give a revelation to men, that cannot be depended on. The con&s;equence is, revelation is de&s;troyed, and infidelity confirmed, on this plan. The rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, and the con|clu&s;ion unavoidable. So that this device for the conver&s;ion of dei&s;ts, turns out &s;elf-&s;ubver&s;ive, and "vain deceit." What then is the true remedy? The wi&s;dom of God and Judge of the world hath taught it, in the go&s;pel commi&s;&s;ion. In&s;pire, animate their hopes, that if they become cordial believers, their reward is great, &s;ure, and eternal: and a&s;&s;ure them by his au|thority, "that he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved;" and by the &s;ame authority, with equal plainne&s;s, &s;olemnity and pathos, an|nounce the other part of the alternative of choice, "he that believeth not &s;hall be damned." This do, to alarm their fears to purpo&s;e, becau&s;e their highe&s;t concernments to eternity, are immediately at &s;take. So that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e hopes and fears may arre&s;t their rea&s;on and attention, to examine the divine credentials of the go&s;pel; that they may believe and be &s;aved. The&s;e are the mo&s;t rational, be&s;t adapted and forcible means and motives, for the conver&s;ion of infidels; the unerring Judge of the world, being judge. 'Tis the&s;e that prevailed and tri|umphed over all oppo&s;ition in the mini&s;try of the apo&s;tles, and have prevailed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages ever &s;ince; and which only, we can rationally expect to prevail, to the end of the world. And the&s;e writers, though unde&s;ignedly, have yet very unhap|pily been barring, in&s;tead of opening, the way for the conver|&s;ion
<PB N="359" REF="019737_0378_0FACA79422B3AEA8">
of infidels, by weakening and di&s;crediting the means and motives to it, appointed by Chri&s;t. Is there not a &s;ingle rati|onal argument for the reception of this impleaded doctrine? Then, let all, both writers and readers, join in the benevolent with of this author "that it might meet with no acceptance in the world," but be bani&s;hed forever. Would we per&s;uade men to believe, to the &s;aving of the &s;oul; it mu&s;t be, by urging the motives in the &s;acred commi&s;&s;ion, in their full force. And would we obtain an eternal weight of glory, we are expre&s;sly taught the way to it, "by looking to things invi&s;ible" as "eternal." AMEN.</P>
