<P>IN Con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent Debate, every impartial Free|holder of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> will be naturally induced to con&s;ider which of the Profe&s;&s;ions in this Country he would ven|ture to chu&s;e as Guardian of his civil and religious Liberties, in a <HI>Government,</HI> where, according to the Con&s;titution, no one Pro+fe&s;&s;ion in particular can be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law, withous a manife&s;t breach and Violation of its original Foundation. But as the Conte&s;t &s;eems particularly to be between the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> we ought, as Members of one common Society, &s;eriou&s;ly to weigh the Merits of both Parties, before we li&s;t our&s;elves under the Banner of ei|ther,&mdash;Neither ought Country, Prejudice of Education, or particular Opinions in Religion, &s;way us with regard to <HI>Government&punc;</HI> becau&s;e even the <HI>Mahometan Juri&s;diction</HI> is to be preferred (with re&s;pect to Liberty of Con&s;cience) to many Countries in <HI>Europe</HI> govern'd by Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I have never read of any Country in the World, where <HI>Quakers</HI> have had Authority except <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> &s;o that all the Examples of their good or bad Admini&s;tration, mu&s;t be drawn from this Place. Now even the mo&s;t prejudiced cannot but acknowledge, after taking an impartial View of the conduct of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that we have been wi&s;ely and judiciou&s;|ly govern'd. For Matters of Fact &s;peak loudly in their Favour. The pre&s;ent amazing Perfection this Province has arrived to in &s;o &s;hort a Time, both in Riches, Trade and Commerce, is owing to the wi&s;e and prudent Ad|mini&s;tration of this good People. Was not every u&s;eful and &s;alutary Plan pur&s;ued by them to encourage Emigrents of all Nations to &s;ettle here? And when they did &s;ettle, did they not enjoy Liberties both civil and religious in the mo&s;t ample Manner? Has the bloody Spirit of Per|&s;ecution ever prevail'd among them to the Detriment of other Chri|&s;tians.

And to whom can the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed go with &s;urer Confidence of Re|lief than to them. And I dare venture to affirm that the&s;e very Con&s;i|derations mov'd the fir&s;t Adventurers from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to &s;end for their poor Relations to populate this Province, who&s;e delightful Plains far &s;urpa&s;s the barren Mountains of <HI>Carentaugher, Slemi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Slevgallion.</HI></P>
<P>Whether any of the&s;e new comers &s;ettled upon unpurcha&s;ed Land belonging to <HI>Indians,</HI> or whether they always kept within Bounds, is a Que&s;tion I will not undertake to determine. But however it appears very unlikely that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould maintain an inviolable friend&s;hip with us, when they might have cru&s;h'd us in a moment, till we were grown a numerous People, and then go to war with us for no rea&s;on when we were able to cope with them in the field of battle.</P>
<P>I &s;hall readily allow that according to the &s;trict rules of <HI>Quaker prin|ciples,</HI> they are not qualified to govern in time of war. And indeed the majority of tho&s;e worthy people them&s;elves are of the &s;ame opinion; for &s;ome time ago, when there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for protecting this province by an armed force, many of the <HI>Friends</HI> who were then in the Hou&s;e of <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> re&s;ign'd their &s;eats, and left the management of public affairs in the hands of people of another profe&s;&s;ion. This part of their conduct certainly argued great prudence and di&s;cretion, as well as wi&s;dom and mode&s;ty. But had their &s;eats been fill'd with <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> we &s;hou'd innevitably have been in a much wor&s;e condition, for it is very evident from undeniable facts, that they are by no means proper men to hold the reigns of government, either in war or peace.</P>
<P>For if a firm attachment to the <HI>King,</HI> and the laws of our country, be nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for a Repre&s;entative of the people, a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> can lay no claim to them; and con&s;equently ought not to be elected. If we are to form any judgment of the pre&s;ent members of that &s;ociety by either their own conduct, or that of their forefathers, we &s;hall find that in the annals both of ancient and modern Hi&s;tory, <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m and Rebellion</HI> were twin-&s;i&s;ters, &s;prung from faction; and their affection for each other has been ever &s;o &s;trong, that a &s;eparation of them never cou'd be effected. What <HI>King</HI> has ever reign'd in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who&s;e Government has not been di&s;turb'd with <HI>Pre&s;byterian Rebellions,</HI> &s;ince ever they were a people? Will they not be an&s;werable for all the inno|cent blood &s;pilt at <HI>Pentland Hills</HI> and <HI>Bothel Bridge?</HI> From whence cou'd they have po&s;&s;ibly learn'd but from <HI>Mahomet</HI> to propogate their Religion with the Sword. If we were to credit their Hypocritical declarations, we mu&s;t believe they are actuated in all their proceedings by the gra|cious influences of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit,</HI> and to be the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> But do they not belie the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> in fathering upon him all the unnatural Rebellions they wickedly rai&s;ed again&s;t their lawful Sovereign <HI>King Charles</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t?</HI> Did the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> teach them to rebel twice, and match to the borders of <HI>England;</HI> and after obtaining every thing they unju&s;tly de&s;ir'd, break their public faith the third time, by entering into a mo&s;t damnable covenant to march an army into <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="009703_0005_0F7A44F90FB1B728">
with a view to extirpate or butcher all tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation,</HI> who wou'd not join them in the wor&s;hip of their great godde&s;s the <HI>Pre&s;|bytery,</HI> which they had &s;et up in their own country&punc; Did the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> teach them to &s;ell their <HI>King,</HI> in imitation of <HI>Judas</HI> who &s;old out <HI>Savior,</HI> even after he had voluntarily re&s;ign'd him&s;elf: Did they not murder their <HI>King</HI> in the face of the &s;un, and put a Tyrant cho&s;en from the very dreggs of the people upon the Throne, who ruled them with a rod of iron, and corrected their harden'd and &s;tubborn di&s;po&s;itions with &s;cor|pions in&s;tead of whips? How did they rai&s;e in&s;urrections in various parts of the kingdom again&s;t <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> And when they collect+ed an army of &s;aints to fight <HI>Cromwell</HI> at the battle of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> did not their mini&s;ters in the name of the Lord a&s;&s;ure the army of &s;ucce&s;s; de|clar'd that they had been &s;eeking <HI>God;</HI> and had obtained an an&s;wer to their prayers? <HI>Cromwell</HI> however &s;oon made it appear that they had be|lied the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and prophe&s;ied fal&s;ely.</P>
<P>Was not the <HI>Scotch Rebellion</HI> one principal cau&s;e of the in&s;urrection of the <HI>Iri&s;h-Papi&s;ts</HI> in the Year 164<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">? The Succe&s;s that attended the one in behalf of the <HI>Kirk,</HI> encouraged the other to pur&s;ue the &s;ame &s;teps in favor of the <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and if &s;o, it may undoubtedly be made a que&s;tion, whether all the innocent blood that was &s;hed in that horrid <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre,</HI> may not be ju&s;tly laid to their charge? Certain it is the Natives of both king|doms &s;eem'd to vie with each other in acts of cruelty. For if the <HI>Ca|tholics</HI> committed many outrages in defending their country again&s;t the inroads and depredations of tho&s;e foreign interlopers who &s;warm'd like locu&s;ts from the barren hills of <HI>Loughaber</HI> in &s;earch of a better country, the <HI>Scotch-Pre&s;byterians</HI> were no way behind hand with them, when with|out the lea&s;t remor&s;e, they murder'd 4,000 of the native <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> men, women and children in the <HI>I&s;le Mc-Gee,</HI> much in the &s;ame manner their offspring murdered the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>However glorious the <HI>Revolution</HI> might be, it is very certain the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> had no hand in it; for it is well known that when the <HI>Eng|li&s;h Church</HI> refus'd to comply with <HI>King James</HI>'s di&s;pen&s;ing power (for which &s;even of their Bi&s;hops were impri&s;on'd, and one of their Univer|&s;ities ruin'd) the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> join'd with that weak, bigotted and tyran|nical Prince, and thank'd his Maje&s;ty in many ful&s;ome Addre&s;&s;es from all parts of the kingdom, for his goodne&s;s in overturning the con&s;titution in favor of them and their dear Brethren the <HI>Catholics.</HI> Many of this &s;ame godly &s;ect took commi&s;&s;ions from <HI>James,</HI> and rais'd Regiments in order to oppo&s;e the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but when the de&s;igns of our <HI>glori|ous Deliverer</HI> were attended with &s;ucce&s;s, then indeed they turn'd tail up|on their old ma&s;ter, and &s;et up their preten&s;ions for merit with the new King, who, being bred a <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd their Religion in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and conferr'd many other acts of favor on them. All this, not|with&s;tanding, cou'd not pre&s;erve his peace, or deter them from plotting again&s;t his Government and per&s;on; for altho' they valued the Man, yet they hated the King, being de&s;irous of no King, but King <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> His

Maje&s;ty, who had been bred up in the principles of moderation in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> recommended a Bill to be pa&s;&s;ed for the Toleration of Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> of that kingdom repre&s;ented it to the people in &s;uch odious and black colors, and petition'd with &s;o much &s;pirit and warmth again&s;t it, as having a pernicious and dangerous ten|dency to de&s;troy the <HI>Kirk,</HI> that it was laid a&s;ide. From this period the <HI>King</HI> de&s;pis'd and abhorr'd them, as a bigotted, &s;tiff-necked, rebellious, pedantic crew, who had gro&s;sly impos'd upon him, in procuring an or|der to ma&s;&s;acre the poor innocent inhabitants of <HI>Glencoe</HI> in cold blood.</P>
<P>I &s;hould exceed the bounds I have pre&s;crib'd to my&s;elf if I was to give a minute account of the Rebellions, which happened in the Year 1715 and 1745 in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when that kingdom was twice up in arms in favor of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> under two of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t <HI>Kings</HI> that ever &s;way'd the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Scepter; I mean <HI>George</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>George</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> Neither has the Government of our pre&s;ent mo&s;t gracious <HI>Sovereign</HI> e&s;|cap'd. It was but the la&s;t &s;ummer that thou&s;ands of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in the North of <HI>Ireland</HI> took up arms under pretence of grievances; but it evidently appear'd that their malice was chiefly bent again&s;t the <HI>Church-Clergy,</HI> who &s;tood in the way of their idol, <HI>Pre&s;bytery;</HI> for they made all the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Clergy in the North fly to the &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Lon|donderry,</HI> in order to avoid being ma&s;&s;acred. From all the&s;e in&s;tances it appears that <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have been always enemies to <HI>Kingly-Govern|ment,</HI> and con&s;equently not fit to be entru&s;ted with any &s;hare of the civil power, when a King reigns: And how can it be otherwi&s;e, &s;eeing that not only their &s;olemn League and Covenant, to which thou&s;ands of them adhere to this day, was founded on Rebellion; but that <HI>Formula</HI> of doc|trine and di&s;cipline, call'd the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> which is the pre|&s;ent infallible &s;tandard receiv'd by the whole body of them, was com|pos'd by a &s;et of men, when they were in open <HI>Rebellion</HI> again&s;t their King; de&s;troying the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and endeavouring to plan, both in Church and State, the Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> after the model of a <HI>Geneva</HI> Republic.</P>
<P>The&s;e few hints may &s;erve as a <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s</HI> for <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> born within the Dominions of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (as Foreigners who go under that name in this Province are not concern'd) who wou'd feign think them&s;elves qualified per&s;ons to &s;it as Repre&s;entatives of a free People. I earne&s;tly hope, every other denomination will take the pains to examine them thro' this per&s;pective, which is no magnifying one; and then judge whether they are fit to be intru&s;ted with our lives, liberties and properties; e&s;pecially if they keep in mind, that whenever this righteous people have the power in their hands, they will tolerate no other profe&s;|&s;ion or opinion but their own, and never cea&s;e till they e&s;tabli&s;h them+&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to exclude all other &s;ects. For the proof of this, witne&s;s <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>New-England;</HI> countries where their reli|gion has been propagated by the Sword, in&s;tead of that peaceful manner recommended by the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009703_0007_0F7A44FD591DC388">Let the righteous blood of the <HI>Quakers</HI> unju&s;tly &s;hed in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> purely for Con&s;cience &s;ake, warn the inhabitants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from tru&s;ting <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> with power, lea&s;t the &s;ame mournful Trage|dies &s;hou'd be acted over again!</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to con&s;ider the Pamphlet intitled the <HI>"Quaker unmask'd"</HI> or <HI>"Plain Truth"</HI> addre&s;s'd (and that &s;eriou&s;ly too) to the Freemen of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author &s;ets out with advi&s;ing us, to find out the "Aggre&s;&s;ors" that the &s;addle at la&s;t may be put on the right hor&s;e. Here I join I&s;&s;ue with him, and do affirm that the rea&s;on of all the pre&s;ent <HI>Party-Rage</HI> was the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> murdering the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> under the Protec|tion of Government; had this not happen'd we &s;hou'd have had none of all this di&s;turbance among us. But how they came to be &s;pirited on to &s;uch an inhuman deed, more than the <HI>Dutch</HI> who are equal &s;ufferers with them on the Frontiers, can be accounted for no otherwi&s;e, than becau&s;e they exceed all other People in acts of brutality. This polite, elegant, witty Pamphleteer condemns the action him&s;elf, but wou'd have us con&s;i|der the alleviating circum&s;tance, "<HI>What are they?</HI>
<Q>Why the Ma&s;&s;acre of the back Inhabitants.</Q>
Here one wou'd have expected that the Gentleman wou'd have attempted to prove the <HI>Lanca&s;ter Indians</HI> guilty; but not a word again&s;t them; not even a pre&s;umption. They had liv'd long 'tis true even from their infancy, in the interior parts of the pro|vince; their characters are well known to be inoffen&s;ive; but we lo&s;t our relations by <HI>Indian Barbarians;</HI> and therefore we will kill <HI>Indians</HI> where|ver we can find them. A fine way of rea&s;oning! Old <HI>King Hendric</HI> who died gloriou&s;ly fighting at the head of his troops for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> wou'd innevitably have been murder'd, had he met with any of the <HI>Paxton-Vo|luntiers</HI> before that time. Tho&s;e brave Fellows al&s;o under <HI>Sir William John&s;on,</HI> wou'd have dyed by the very men, for whom they are going to battle. And not even the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Pre&s;byterian Indian Saints</HI> under the learned, pious and Rev. <HI>Mr. Braynard</HI> would have e&s;cap'd the <HI>Paxton-Boys.</HI></P>
<P>Another alleviating Circum&s;tance our Author mentions, page 6th, is, "that they had long before &s;ent &s;everal petitions to the Governor and A&s;&s;embly, which were conceal'd by ill de&s;igning per&s;ons." I wi&s;h this elegant writer had nam'd the men to whom the Petitions were delivered, that the public might be aware of them. Tho&s;e in Government who act wrong &s;hou'd undoubtedly be brought to the light, that if members of the Hou&s;e, we may mark them at the next election; and if of the Coun|cil, that his Honor may call them to an account for thus bringing him and the Province into di&s;tre&s;s. This is a Piece of Ju&s;tice due to the inno|cent, who are under this indefinite charge? for why &s;hou'd the prudent and ju&s;t be cen&s;ur'd for a fault of which they never were guilty; Be&s;ides, why was not copies of the petitions publi&s;h'd, that the public might judge whether they contain'd any thing worthy the attention of the <HI>Le|gi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009703_0008_0F7A44FE43669EE8">After all, I am induc'd to believe the truth is, the&s;e men acted in the &s;ame manner the <HI>Catholics</HI> did in <HI>Ireland,</HI> Fir&s;t begin the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and then appoint the able&s;t of their Divines to &s;tudy for arguments to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>We are told in this &s;ame &s;ublime pamphlet,
<Q>that &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Barracks</HI> were well known to have been at the battle again&s;t Col. <HI>Bouquet,</HI> and at the Siege of <HI>Fort Pitt</HI> by officers who are in town.</Q>
If &s;o, the&s;e military Gentlemens conduct, upon this occa&s;ion, ought to have been a pattern of humanity to the&s;e brave <HI>Paxton Volunteers&punc;</HI> Parti|cularly when we reflect that<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Capt. Don.</NOTE> one of the&s;e very Officers whom we have the honor to re&s;ide among us, in an engagement with the&s;e <HI>Savages,</HI> was &s;hot, as I apprehend, through the Lungs, and notwith&s;tanding this took up arms in their defence, when likely to be attack'd at the Barracks.</P>
<P>What was it did honor to the characters of <HI>General Amher&s;t</HI> and <HI>Sir William John&s;on</HI> upon the total reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> but their re&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ain|ing our <HI>Indians</HI> and Army from any acts of cruelty upon the <HI>Canadians</HI> or their <HI>Savage Allies,</HI> who had been murdering and &s;calping our Pron|tiers all this war? To kill an enemy in the heat of battle is honorable, but to put him to death when he is di&s;arm'd, tied and bound at your feet, is a cowardly action, and argues a prodigious depravity of <HI>Human Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author produces the Revolution as an in&s;tance to ju&s;tify the <HI>Pax|ton-In&s;urgents.</HI> If he thus mi&s;applies the Bible when he preaches, he &s;hall never be my Teacher. But for curio&s;ity &s;ake, let us &s;ee how the compari&s;on will hold. The whole People of <HI>England</HI> headed by two branches of the <HI>Legi&s;lature,</HI> oppo&s;es the King for perverting the Govern|ment. Therefore about two hundred <HI>lawle&s;s Banditti</HI> of <HI>Paxton</HI> and <HI>Donegall</HI> may attempt to overthrow all the parts of the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania.</HI>&mdash;A Province containing about 250,000 Inhabitants. Such is the great force of our Author's Logic when reduced to form; but I am almo&s;t tired with his ab&s;ur'd and inconclu&s;ive manner of rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Our Author further tells us, page 6th,
<Q>the <HI>Indians</HI> were in great danger of receiving their ju&s;t de&s;erts;</Q>
i. e. the <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> were ju&s;t at hand with intention to murder them, had not their Friends from the Ci|ty, who were in League with them, made them acquainted with the regu|lar force in the Barracks: But he forgets him&s;elf page 8th, where he in|forms us,
<Q>that their de&s;ign was nothing el&s;e, but that their grievances might have a fair hearing.</Q>
Thus he contradicts in one page what he a&s;&s;erts in another, My advice to him is (and I humbly apprehend it is &s;a|lutary) that he wou'd get &s;ome better information of the &s;ubject he un|dertakes to di&s;cu&s;s. when he takes up his pen the next time to write, otherwi&s;e he will be perpetually liable to mi&s;takes and blunders.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> were brave and loyal &s;ubjects to his Maje&s;ty" &s;ays this judicious Pamphleteer. As to their bravery no body will ever di&s;|pute it that has heard of their gallant and loyal behaviour at <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> where only fifty of them compleatly armed were able to vanqui&s;h a nu|merous company of eight men and women, and &s;even &s;mall children, all

coop'd up in a Jail. The &s;ame of this noble and gallant exploit ought &s;urely to be recorded in the annals of <HI>America</HI> for the honor of the reli|gious, chri&s;tian <HI>Pre&s;byterians.</HI></P>
<P>Their Loyalty was equally con&s;picuous in bidding defiance to the pro|clamations of his Honor; trampling upon the ju&s;t and righteous Laws of their Country; and holding a Treaty with his Maje&s;ty's Repre&s;entative as if they were Foreigners at war with <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> What a No&s;e of wax the word Loyalty has been made to &s;erve the vile purpo&s;es of all the in&s;urrections that have been rais'd again&s;t the Sovereign, is well known to tho&s;e, who are the lea&s;t acquainted with Hi&s;tory? The Rebels in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> in 1641, call'd them&s;elves loyal &s;ubjects to <HI>King Charles.</HI> And the <HI>Scotch</HI> Rebels, when they march'd an army to de&s;troy the king, not only warmly profe&s;s'd, but &s;wore to be loyal to him and his hens in their infa|mous covenant.&mdash;Oh! but crys the Gentleman, they did no body any harm. No thanks to them for that For had they gone to rob and plun|der the country, the whole Province wou'd have bravely hunted them down like wolves, Be&s;ides it was politic in them to behave di&s;creetly to the Inhabitants. When the Pretender march'd into <HI>England</HI> the la&s;t Re|bellion, his Adherents behav'd as di&s;creetly as the <HI>Paxton Boys,</HI> yet this did not &s;ave the Leaders of them from the ax and the halter.</P>
<P>I can't comprehend how our Author &s;hou'd know that <HI>Squaws</HI> have charms, had they not made &s;ome deep impre&s;&s;ions on his own heart. For Love <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, is &s;tronger than Death. Po&s;&s;ibly however the jealou&s;y of being rivall'd may have been the cau&s;e of the late di&s;ta&s;te he and his brethren have conceiv'd for the&s;e poor females; it &s;o, I can a&s;&s;ure them, they may with all the freedom in the world repair to the Barracks, and brighten their former acquaintance, as all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this kind are ea&s;ily wa&s;h'd away by &s;tanding in the <HI>Kirk.</HI></P>
<P>I would &s;eriou&s;ly ask this great Writer, or any of his Advocates, what cou'd a &s;ett of men do more in the A&s;&s;embly for protecting this Province, than the people call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> have done&punc; It can be undeniably prov'd that more money has been rais'd in this Province for carrying on the war, than any other in <HI>America.</HI> It can al&s;o be prov'd that the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing money was never di&s;puted, but the mode of taxation: Had our Re|pre&s;entatives given up this inherent right of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> they wou'd have betray'd the tru&s;t repos'd in them by their Con&s;tituents, and de&s;erv'd the cen&s;ure of the very <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> them&s;elves. Be&s;ides their peculiar tenets in religion as is alledg'd, have no influence on their actions relative to Government. For <HI>Quakers</HI> are no more an&s;werable for the bad con|&s;equences charg'd upon their doctrines by the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> when they do not affect their conduct) than <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> are chargeable with all the ab|&s;urdities of <HI>Ab&s;olute Decrees.</HI></P>
<P>Shou'd not a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> be as pa&s;&s;ive as a <HI>Quaker</HI> according to his own principles; for certainly if God fore-ordains whatever comes to pa&s;s, he can no more alter the irre&s;i&s;table decree, than he can overturn the world; con&s;equently all re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an enemy is vain, becau&s;e we

then fight again&s;t the will of God, and re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> which is an abominable crime.</P>
<P>Our Author makes a tedious Harrangue about the <HI>Quakers</HI> for once taking up arms to defend them&s;elves, when the city appear'd to be in the utmo&s;t danger of ma&s;&s;acre, Plunder and de&s;olation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a total overthrow of the very being of our con&s;titution. This is a &s;imilar ca&s;e to that at the Revolution. No one precept in the Go&s;pel is more power|fully enforc'd than obedience to the King; ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, however, for once compell'd the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation,</HI> at the Revolution, to di&s;pen&s;e with this po&s;itive command. Now will our Author be &s;o hardy as to ask,
<Q>if the&s;e are the people, who always profe&s;s obedience to the King according to a divine command;" and then conclude; "what amazing hypocri&s;y appears in their profe&s;&s;ion." "They mu&s;t either confe&s;s that they have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, or that the <HI>Holy Spi|rit</HI> has given them a new Go&s;pel contradictory to the old one; but this is to bla&s;pheme God, and belie the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> yet &s;uch is their con|duct.</Q>
This is the force of his Argument when applied to the Revo|lution; and any one wou'd certainly conclude that our Author by his manner of rea&s;oning was a <HI>Nonjuror:</HI> And indeed I am apt to believe there is &s;omething in it; for I never heard that <HI>Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> country were oblig'd to take the Oaths to the Government, or give any other te&s;t of their fidelity to the King. Whoever heard a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Sermon upon the duty of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment? Are not the Covenanters preaching again&s;t his Maje&s;ty every day, and all by the direction of the Spirit? Four different &s;orts of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have all in the name of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit</HI> damn'd each other in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Mu&s;t not each party have belied the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit,</HI> in anouncing contradic|tory and bla&s;phemous Anathemas in his name? But to conclude. Beware, my Countrymen, of men who wou'd cram Laws down your throats with muskets, daggers, tomahawks and &s;calping-knives. Give me leave to recommend to you a &s;pirit of watchfulne&s;s and jealou&s;y. The Inhabitants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> enjoy the mo&s;t exten&s;ive privileges both ci|vil and religious of any people in the world. Let us then, like true <HI>Britons,</HI> warmly oppo&s;e any that wou'd pre&s;ume to deprive us of them! Let us boldly contend for the cau&s;e of Liberty and our Country, and never be pu&s;illanimous or &s;upine&punc; when we &s;ee men of bad principles at work behind the curtain, to wre&s;t them out of our hands! Let us as we value every thing that is dear and &s;acred to us, endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s the pre&s;ent prevailing faction! And finally, let us exert all our influence and power to keep the Reigns of Government out of the hands of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> (which can be done no other way than by placing our&s;elves under the protection of our gracious and royal Ma&s;ter, <HI>King George</HI> the third of ble&s;&s;ed me|mory) as we are convinc'd, thoroughly convinc'd, of their unfitne&s;s to govern both by experience and undeniable in&s;tances from Hi&s;tory!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Countrymen and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is now come that we mu&s;t either &s;ubmit our necks to the yoke of <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> bondage, or exert our&s;elves with a true <HI>Briti&s;h Spirit</HI> in behalf of our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country.</HI> For was it ever known in any part of the world, that &s;uch as appear'd in defence of a <HI>Government,</HI> &s;hou'd be treated with contempt, and look'd upon as ene|mies to it; and that others cou'd recommend them&s;elves by boldly flying in its face and trampling upon its authority. But &s;uch is the profound, wi&s;e policy of &s;ome of our <HI>State Phy&s;icians,</HI> who have been at work be|hind the &s;cenes to encourage one part of the inhabitants to ri&s;e up in arms, and attempt to draw blood of the re&s;t; tho' happy for us, they are too rampant, and not ea&s;ily rid out of their liberties.</P>
<P>The veil of hypocri&s;y was too thin, and is now plainly &s;een thro' by the good inhabitants of this province, who heartily and &s;incerely pity the poor de&s;picable wretches that were made <HI>Dupes</HI> of upon this occa&s;ion to &s;erve the turn of tho&s;e &s;hallow pated <HI>State&s;men,</HI> who cun|ger up &s;torms and tempe&s;ts to ca&s;t away the &s;hip that they may (like
<PB N="14" REF="009703_0012_0F7A450130ECBC08">
the moon-cur&s;ers of <HI>Cornwal</HI>) murder the crew, and run away with the plunder.</P>
<P>As I am an <HI>American</HI> born, and have neither place nor pen&s;ion under the G&mdash;t, I earne&s;tly hope my dear countrymen will look upon my weak endeavours to &s;erve them, free from prejudice and partiality, and as the overflowings of a heart truly touch'd with a deep &s;en&s;e of their misfortunes, and &s;ympathizing with them under their pre&s;ent unhappy calamity.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not rou&s;e the indignation of every patriot brea&s;t in P&mdash;a to &s;ee &s;o many hireling pens pro&s;tituted to &s;upport arbitrary mea&s;ures; when if they were equally employ'd in vindicating the rights and li|berties of the people; in expo&s;ing wicked mini&s;ters of &s;tate, tho&s;e &s;ons of corruption, who are preparing the minds of mankind for &s;la|very and bondage, they might do honor to them&s;elves, die without a guilty con&s;cience &s;taring them in the face, and their memory (in&s;tead of rotting) wou'd be gratefully rever'd by po&s;terity?</P>
<P>As my principal de&s;ign is to examine the merit of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> for government, without troubling my&s;elf much about pamphlets, that have, or may be written in defence of the <HI>P&mdash;r</HI> and his <HI>Tools</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Freemen</HI> of this Province; neverthele&s;s I look upon it as a Duty incumbent on me ju&s;t to give a <HI>Key</HI> to one of them, call'd the "Conduct of the Paxton Men impartially repre&s;ented."</P>
<P>This Sixpenny Piece con&s;i&s;ts of thirty three Pages, twenty of which the Author has borrow'd in Order to &s;well the Performance, other|wi&s;e I apprehend the thirteen pages of his own dry Reflections wou'd have been &s;old for two Coppers, by which Means the mercenary Views of both Author and Printer wou'd have been entirely di&s;appointed.&mdash; Such are the cunning Schemes projected amid&s;t the Scarcity of Ca&s;h that now prevails, by the&s;e pamphleteering Gentlemen, in Order to make the Public pay for what they were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of before. The Inju|ry he has done to the back Inhabitants by mi&s;repre&s;enting their <HI>Mani|fe&s;to,</HI> can &s;carce ever be forgiven him, for in tran&s;cribing this <HI>Remon&s;|trance</HI> of Grievances, he has artfully &s;ub&s;tituted the Word, "<HI>Quakers,</HI> for <HI>P&mdash;r,</HI> in order I apprehend to throw the blame upon them and their A&s;&s;embly. If the Reader however in the Peru&s;al of the Pamphlet, will bear this in his Mind, and as he goes along, when he meets with words. <HI>Tyrant, Traytor, Rebel,</HI> &amp;c. Apply the fir&s;t to a certain Ruler not much e&s;teem'd, and the two la&s;t to the <HI>Paxton Men,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byterians!</HI> The&s;e with a few more of the like Emendations, may make it tolerable Sen&s;e and what is more give it &s;ome Color of Truth.</P>
<P>Our Author commends the <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> of the Freemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> for murdering <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in the State Hou&s;e, becau&s;e he had tyranni|cally depriv'd them of their Liberty, and reduc'd them to a State of Va&s;&s;alage and Slavery.&mdash;I believe his Employers have more Under|&s;tanding than to thank him for this In&s;tance of his Zeal, as it militates &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t the Cau&s;e for which it was produc'd, and &s;ets &s;uch an Example to the Senators of P&mdash;,a as I am confident they wou'd by
<PB N="15" REF="009703_0013_0F7A4502488F8358">
no Means imitate. Thus I might run a Parallel thro' all his In&s;tances from Prophane Hi&s;tory, to &s;hew that every Example he has adduc'd is in Favor of the People and their Repre&s;entatives. He has taken a Deal of Pains to &s;hew the Similarity between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> (but this was a needle&s;s Undertaking, as every Body knew it before). He has al&s;o endeavor'd to make it appear that all other <HI>Profe&s;&s;ions</HI> intermix'd among them, are the <HI>Heathens</HI> with whom they have to contend. That if there|fore <HI>Force</HI> will not do, <HI>Fraud</HI> may be made u&s;e of to de&s;troy their Op|po&s;ers, by Craft, Treachery, or Di&s;&s;imulation.&mdash;He wou'd feign make us believe too that as God formerly gave the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> by a Charter from Heaven to the Jews; &s;o he has given <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> by Virtue of the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Judith,</HI> cries our Author, tells a Lye to <HI>Holofernus,</HI> makes him drunk, and then &s;evers his Head from his Body with a Scymitar,&mdash;&s;o ought all the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m,</HI> &s;erve tho&s;e of a different Per&s;ua&s;ion who do not coincide with them in Religion and Politics, &s;mite them under the fifth Rib as <HI>Joab</HI> did <HI>Abner,</HI> and betray them with a Ki&s;s into the Hands of their Enemies, as <HI>Judas</HI> did our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Savior.</HI> Might I not as well quote this Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> and apply it with equal Propriety to the late Expedition to <HI>German-town? Holofernus</HI> (i. e. Col&mdash;A.-m-s-g) was the chief Captain of the Army of the Paxton Volunteers, who had formerly march'd We&s;t and &s;ecur'd him&s;elf behind a Tree; till his Forces vanqui&s;h'd the <HI>Catananites;</HI> after which, in the Name of the Ho&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he fired at a Bundle of Deer-Skins which fell before him; for which gallant and brave Exploit he was crown'd with Laurels: He then ruin'd his Sword again&s;t <HI>Judah</HI> to the Ea&s;tward, and &s;aid I will go forth in my Wrath and devour mine Enemies, and &s;traitly block up the Capitol.&mdash;Now had there been a Woman in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as bold as <HI>Judith,</HI> and us'd the &s;ame Means to de&s;troy this <HI>Holofernus</HI> in <HI>Ger|mantown,</HI> wou'd &s;he not be equally entitled to the Ble&s;&s;ings pronounc'd by <HI>Ozias,</HI> that Judith was, according to the curious Application our ju|dicious Author has made to this Text?</P>
<P>What a &s;hocking Opinion mu&s;t Mankind have of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> who fir&s;t kill People, and then erect Courts of <HI>Judicature</HI> to try them? Our Author has been at great Pains to take ex Parte Depo&s;itions, and pub|li&s;h them to the World as &s;ufficient Proof of the <HI>Indians</HI> Guilt. There|fore whether they were innocent or guilty is little to the Purpo&s;e now, as their Doom is irrever&s;able. Will the Verdict of the Public re&s;tore them to Life, &s;uppo&s;e it is given in their Favor. The&s;e Allegations were &s;uf|ficient, if true, to confine them by Virtue of the civil Authority in or|der to bring them to a legal Tryal, that they might either be acquitted or condemn'd by their Country.&mdash;But who, under the Heavens, gave Presbyterians Authority to be their own Carvers, or appointed them Judges, Jurors, Hangmen, and Executioners, to butcher the <HI>Indians,</HI> Man, Woman and Child in cold Blood, without fir&s;t examining either their Merit, or Demerit, or giving them any Chance to plead for them|&s;elves?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009703_0014_0F7A4504F305D038">The <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> want more Members from the back Counties to re|pre&s;ent them, and have added this to the Catalogue of their Grievances upon the Frontiers. Now &s;uppo&s;e it was granted, I believe it wou'd make very little Alteration for the better, as that County has &s;eldom &s;ent a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> to repre&s;ent them, (one qualified being very rarely to be found,) and but a-few from the others; and even &s;ome of tho&s;e that are &s;ent, appear as warm for the Liberties of their Country as any of their Brother Members. Are not the Gentlemen in general who repre&s;ent the five back Counties, I wou'd &s;eriou&s;ly ask this Gentleman, as unani|mous in their Votes again&s;t the P&mdash;r as any of the Members who repre|&s;ent the interior Parts of the <HI>Province?</HI> And are not they the be&s;t Judges from what Fountain the Grievances of their Con&s;tituents flow? Had they prote&s;ted again&s;t the Re&s;olves of the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> publi&s;h'd their Rea&s;ons, and &s;hewn that they were out number'd by a <HI>Quaker Majority;</HI> there wou'd have been &s;ome color of Argument for making &s;uch a Clamor about more Members. But no &s;uch Thing. The&s;e Gentlemen know the odds be|tween &s;ixpence and a Shilling, as well as other People, and think it no Deed of Charity to pay the P&mdash;r's Taxes, who&s;e E&s;tate is &s;aid to be worth, at a moderate Computation, ten Millions Sterling.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that all Means are to be u&s;'d between this, and next Election to unite the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> as one Man to chu&s;e &s;uch Per&s;ons for A&s;&s;emblymen who (upon certain Conditions) will grant any Thing the P&mdash;s demand. This Plot may be conceited by &s;ome-time &s;erving Hirelings of that Party, but I cannot &s;uffer my&s;elf to believe the Majority of the landed Men among them who, by the bye, love Money as well as their Neighbours, and are no <HI>Creatures</HI> to the <HI>G&mdash;t</HI> wou'd ever &s;ubmit to &s;uch a &s;ervile Yoke&mdash;If any Thing induces them it mu&s;t be their clo&s;e Attachment to their peculiar Tenets in Religion; the artful Per&s;ua&s;ions of their Teachers; and the com|fortable hopes of an E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> And if the&s;e Mo|tives prevail what may we expect to be the Con&s;equences? Why&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a Bill exempting the Proprietaries from all Taxes forever,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A Bill &s;ettling an Annuity upon <HI>Deputy Governors</HI> for the Time being of one Thou&s;and per Annum or more. In lieu of which the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians</HI> &s;hall have.</P>

The <HI>Pre&s;byterian Policy</HI> therefore pur&s;ued with indefatigable Zeal, in this,
<PB N="17" REF="009703_0015_0F7A4506401AE6B8">
and the Neighboring <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> ought to awaken the Atten|tion of every true Lover of his Country, and rou&s;e all other Per&s;ua&s;ions, to unite as one Man again&s;t them, being the mo&s;t formidable and dangerous Enemies we have to cope with.</P>
<P>Let us next examine into the Charity of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> &s;o much boa&s;t|ed of, I will not &s;ay to other Societies; for that was never heard of; but even to their own di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Brethren on the Frontiers.</P>
<P>I believe it will be as hard a Task to prove, that ever they, (con&s;ider'd as a Society) rais'd a <HI>general Contribution,</HI> of <HI>their own Money,</HI> for the Relief of the <HI>back Inhabitants,</HI> as it is to prove, that <HI>Quakers</HI> did &s;o; and I think the mo&s;t difficult Work of the two. Here I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of their pa&s;&s;ionate Teachers will be ready to fly in my Face, and ask me, with an angry Tone,
<Q>if we did not give away Hundreds both at <HI>Lanca&s;ter Trea|ty,</HI> and afterwards, when every Body was rai&s;ing Men for them, <HI>ex|cept Quakers.</HI></Q>
I readily own it. But the next Que&s;tion is, pray Gen|tlemen, who&s;e money were you &s;o liberal of? Was it your own, or the cha|ritable contributions of the <HI>Good People of England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> put into your Hands for that U&s;e?&mdash;If it was your own, then you have the&s;e charitable Donations &s;till in your Pockets, to &s;upply the Sums you have advanced, and pay you for your Di&s;bur&s;ments. And if it was not your own, but the Money rais'd in <HI>England,</HI> that you and your Brethren pa|raded away upon at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> and &s;ince made &s;uch a Noi&s;e about your Cha|rity to the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> on the Frontiers, as I am apt to believe it was? why in the Name of Sen&s;e do you a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Merit</HI> of it to your&s;elves, as if you were the only charitable, humane People in the Province.&mdash;Either you mu&s;t candidly confe&s;s that this is the true State of the Ca&s;e, or you have impos'd upon the generous People of <HI>Europe</HI> with fal&s;e Notions.</P>
<P>As many of my Readers, (who are not of their Profe&s;&s;ion) may be un|acquainted with this Piece of <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> craft, I &s;hall unravel the whole My&s;tery of their iniquitous Scheme, contriv'd in their mo&s;t &s;acred A&s;|&s;emblies, by the be&s;t and able&s;t of their Divines and Lay-Elders.</P>
<P>A few Years ago the Heads of this Society petition'd the <HI>Governor</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> for a Charter to incorporate a certain Number of them&s;elves, to rai&s;e Money for the U&s;e of <HI>poor, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters and their Widows;</HI> their Petition being granted with certain Powers and Limitations, the next Con&s;ideration was how to procured Fund.

the va&s;t Numbers of Chri&s;tian Captives doom'd to perpetual Slave|ry, together with the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of contributing Money for their Re|demption. This was undoubtedly a crafty Scheme. For as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had often contributed Money for the Redemption of <HI>Chri&s;tian Captives in</HI> Africa, large Sums were generou&s;ly given for the&s;e pious U&s;es; at which liberal Donations we need not be &s;urpriz'd, if we can credit the <HI>Pre&s;by|terians</HI> them&s;elves, who &s;ay, "that this very Deputy of theirs carried Home with him a Parcel of Squirrel Scalps&punc; and when he had in <HI>Ireland,</HI> work'd up the Pa&s;&s;ions of his Audience by di&s;mal and melancholly Relations of murder'd <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> in the back Woods to a proper Degree of Fer|mentation; produc'd the&s;e as Proofs, declaring they were the Skins of their Heads that were barbarou&s;ly and cruelly torn off by the wild <HI>Indians.</HI> In Con&s;equence, I &s;ay, of this mournful Detail, the People were extreamly charitable; never once dreaming that three fourths of their Donations wou'd never be applied to the U&s;es for which they were given.&mdash;How|ever when the Cheat was di&s;cover'd innocently in <HI>England</HI> by one who was their very good Friend, but not in the Plot, the Pedlar &s;lipt off, and left the be&s;t Part of his Pack behind him, which was detain'd, till proper A&s;&s;urances were given from this Side the Water, that it &s;hou'd not all be mi&s;applied.&mdash;.To &s;ave Appearances then, an Addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to Governor <HI>H</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> from a Deputation of this <HI>Pre&s;byterian Corporation</HI> &s;etting forth their De&s;ire to advance a Sum of Money for the Re|demption of Captives, a Copy of which, with his Honor's An&s;wer was &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> to ju&s;tify the Pedlar's Brief, and confute the &s;up|po&s;ed A&s;per&s;ions of a certain Gentleman, however notwith&s;tanding all this, as Truth will generally prevail he ju&s;tify'd him&s;elf, by de|tecting their Fal&s;hoods, Malice and Knavery in a written Vindication, Sign'd by one of the P&mdash;rs, and <HI>Dr, Chandler,</HI> (the Head of the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in <HI>England</HI>) and tran&s;mitted it over here, by way of a <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s</HI> for them to &s;ee them&s;elves in; but they appear'd &s;o ex|ceedingly ugly and deform'd they were a&s;ham'd to &s;hew this <HI>Gla&s;s</HI> even to &s;ome of their own Brethren.</P>

This Crime I apprehend is equal in Guilt to many made Capital in <HI>England:</HI> If &s;o, what then did our Orator de&s;erve who wickedly defrauded the Public, or what did tho&s;e men de&s;erve, who advis'd him to that ba&s;e and unrighteous Mea|&s;ure?

<Q>Maje&s;ty will judge of Quaker and Pre&s;byterian Loyalty; ac|cording to the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> Proofs that each gives of it in Time of Danger.</Q>
Half a Million of Money given to defend the Govern|ment, is certainly one <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> Proof of Quaker Loyalty; and what is a farther and &s;tronger Confirmation of it, is, that they are heartily willing, and extreamly anxious that his Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd take them under his immediate Protection and Government. They are not a|fraid of loo&s;ing their Charter; of being &s;addled with heavier Taxes; or paying Tythes to the Church Clergy, as this whiffling Politician <HI>&s;quints</HI> at in one of his Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider what are the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> Proofs of Pre&s;byterian Loyalty.

<P>Our general A&s;&s;embly having adjourn'd for a &s;hort Time to con|&s;ult their Con&s;tituents whether an humble Addre&s;s &s;hou'd be drawn up and tran&s;mitted to his Maje&s;ty, praying that he wou'd be pleas'd to take this Province under his immediate Protection and Government; that

is; whether the Freemen of this Province &s;hou'd Petition the King, that we may be <HI>reduc'd to the Form of a King's Government.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;byterians here, upon mature Deliberation, are of opinion, that it is is not <HI>&s;afe</HI> to do Things of &s;uch Importance ra&s;hly; Our Privileges by the&s;e means may be greatly <HI>abridged,</HI> but will never be <HI>enlarged.</HI></P>
<P>We are under the Kings Protection and Government now as much as we can be, for he will never govern us in Per&s;on, and it is of no great <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> whether his Deputy be recommended by the Proprietaries, or by &s;ome other great Men to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Charter</HI> is in <HI>Danger</HI> by &s;uch a <HI>Change,</HI> and let no Man per|&s;uade you to the contrary. There has been a half yearly Meeting of the Quakers in this City, but this Change of Government has not been propos'd in their Meeting, as we can yet under&s;tand, nor is it approv'd of by the Heads of that Society.</P>
<P>This Affair is in all Probability, a <HI>Trap</HI> laid to en&s;nare the unwary, and then to ca&s;t an Odium on the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> for ruining or attempt|ing to ruin the Province.

For the&s;e Rea&s;ons we wou'd earne&s;tly recom|mend it to you to lo&s;e no Time in advi&s;ing all under your Influence, whether of our Denomination or others, from &s;igning any &s;uch Pe|tition&mdash;</P>

<P>By this Letter his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and the Public may plainly &s;ee what &s;ort of Loyal Subjects <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> are to him in this Government, who think it the greate&s;t Cur&s;e that can befal them, to be <HI>reduc'd to the Form of a King's Government:</HI> Their Quarrel is not with a bad King, more than a good one; but their Abhorrence is to the very <HI>Form,</HI> which they utterly dete&s;t, as incon&s;i&s;tent with their <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter platform,</HI> and a perpetual Check to the Rigor of their Di&s;cipline. The general Cry of <HI>modern Pre&s;byterians,</HI> is to glory in the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and their firm Attachment to the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Hanover;</HI> to lay all the Blame of former Rebellions at the Door of the <HI>Covenanters,</HI> and the Oppre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>STEWART.</HI>&mdash;What kind of Affection they have for King <HI>George</HI> is evident in this Letter, by which they are &s;owing the Seeds of Di&s;loyalty among the good People of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI>&mdash;This however is quite agreeable to the Tenor of their Conduct under King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P><Q>When the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners return'd from King <HI>William</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and told the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the King had po&s;itively declar'd, that he wou'd not any longer &s;uffer them to op|pre&s;s and per&s;ecute the <HI>Epi&s;copal Subjects.</HI> The Moderators &s;aid open|ly

that if it were not for the great Army he had with him he dur&s;t not have &s;aid &s;o to them," And however, it wou'd have been wi&s;er in him to have held his Peace, for they own'd no Ma&s;ter but <HI>Chri&s;t."</HI> One of them in a Sermon "declar'd, that <HI>King William</HI> de&s;ign'd to dethrone. <HI>King Je&s;us."</HI> And the Moderator of the General A&s;&s;embly imme|diately after it's Di&s;&s;olution, reflected upon <HI>King William,</HI> as &s;ent in Wrath to be a Cur&s;e to <HI>God's Kirk.</HI>&mdash;Another of their Preachers tells us that they brought in a Dog, (<HI>i. e.</HI> K. Wm.) for Gods Sake, and that he now began to bite the Bairnes <HI>i. e.</HI> the Children.&mdash;One Mr. <HI>Kennedy</HI> in the &s;ame Reign, before the General A&s;&s;embly in which he was Moderator &s;aid in his Prayer, "Lord!

<P>Mr. Borlands in Gallowshields pray'd thus,
<Q>O God! Thou ha&s;t bid|den us pray for Kings, and yet they have been always very trouble|&s;ome to thy <HI>Kirk;</HI> they &s;ay that this new King thou ha&s;t &s;ent us, viz. King William takes the Sacrament from the Hands of a Bi&s;hop kneel|ing; ah!</Q>
That's black Work, that's foul Work. Lord deliver him from Popery, and Prelacy; from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;cience; and the Hard|heartedne&s;s of the <HI>Stewarts.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that nor only Covenanters, but the whole Body of Presbyterians are actuated by the &s;ame rebellious Principles &s;ince the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI> they were before; and that not even the E&s;tabli&s;hment of their Profe&s;&s;ion in <HI>Scotland</HI> can make them in Love with <HI>Monarchy.</HI> Is not the Language of the&s;e Quotations from their Moderators and principal Divines, exactly of a Piece with this treacherous Je&s;uitical Presbyte|rian <HI>Bull</HI> &s;ent forth from the College of Philadelphia? Are the&s;e fit Men to have the Tuition of His Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects? To in&s;till in|to the Youth an evil Idea of <HI>Royal Government;</HI> to in&s;truct them, that a covetous, mercenary, avaritious, tyrannical hard-hearted land-Lord, who is for laying heavy Burdens on his Tenents, and will not touch them with one of his Fingers is to be preferr'd to our mo&s;t <HI>gracious So|vereign;</HI> that his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> will ABRIDGE us of our Privileges, but we may be a&s;&s;ur'd he never will ENLARGE them, or grant us any Favor; and la&s;tly, that the Province may expect nothing but Ruin, De&s;truction and De&s;olation, the Moment we put our&s;elves under <HI>King George the Third.</HI>&mdash;Cou'd a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> cou'd a <HI>Spaniard</HI> entertain a wor&s;e Opi|nion of the glorious Con&s;titution of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> Yet the&s;e are the Men, who wou'd &s;carce have a Mouthful of Bread to &s;upport them&s;elves or their Families, had it not been for his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Royal Bounty and Favor, in promoting a generous Collection by his own good Example; I &s;ay, the&s;e are the Men, who maliciou&s;ly a&s;per&s;e his Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="009703_0021_0F7A450A3AF77198">However &s;ome particular Friends have &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be di&s;train'd upon, rather than pay Taxes towards carrying on the War, yet they have been always pa&s;&s;ive without the lea&s;t murmuring. The Number that en|tertain the&s;e con&s;cientious Scruples is but &s;mall, the Majority of that good People having always contributed their <HI>Quota</HI> as chearfully as any other Society. How therefore <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> or tho&s;e who write in their behalf, can have the A&s;&s;urance to ca&s;t this in their Teeth, above all other People (when they know that they have carried this Point further than any <HI>Quakers</HI> ever did in the World) is a Piece of Effrontery that can only be fitted to their own Foreheads.</P>
<P>In a Book call'd the <HI>Hind let loo&s;e</HI> which is almo&s;t as &s;acred among them as the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Page 701, I find this Declaration.
<Q>The exacting Taxations for maintaining the Army, and the paying of Sub&s;idies, was, and remains to be a con&s;uming crim&s;on wick|edne&s;s, the cry whereof reaches to Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame Author, Page 912, I find Words to this Purport,
<Q>The paying of Sub&s;idies to the pre&s;ent Government, is to furni&s;h that Party of the Dragon's Legions, in their War again&s;t Michael with Sup|plies, which no Body can excu&s;e no more than &s;heding the Blood of their innocent Children to Molach.</Q>
&mdash;Now did ever any Quaker make u&s;e of &s;uch vile Language again&s;t the Government? Did ever a Quaker reckon the granting of Supplies for the King's U&s;e as crying a Sin as the &s;acrificing innocent Children to the Devil?</P>
<P>I appeal to the impartial Part of the Pre&s;byterians them&s;elves, if they think, that our Repre&s;entatives can have any Thing el&s;e in View but the Good of their Country, in the Struggle they make in Behalf of the Liberties of the Province,&mdash;I have often heard that Parliament Men have been blam'd and cen&s;ur'd for &s;elling them&s;elves and their Country, to wicked Mini&s;ters of State, for a Bribe, Place or Pen&s;ion, but never for oppo&s;ing illegal Taxes; arbitrary Power; or Mini&s;terial Corruption.&mdash;The ever memorable <HI>Hambden</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles the</HI> 1&s;t, rather than pay an illegal Tax of 30 S.

It is of no le&s;s importance than the e&s;tabli&s;hing of our mo&s;t holy Religion in this Province; for the Accompli&s;hment of which you know all means, whether ju&s;tifiable or unju&s;tifiable, are to be us'd, &s;eeing the End is &s;o valuable. Our late Behaviour in killing the Savages in in this Place; marching to <HI>Germantown;</HI> and intimidating the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> hath &s;o far recommended our Society to the G&mdash;t that all the Places of Tru&s;t are to be thrown into our Hands, e&s;pecially the Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace. And as you know the New Lights and old Lights who were formerly Ju&s;tices, gave Judgment again&s;t the Followers of each other, according as the Plaintiff or Defendant was of a Party, and not agreeable to the Merits of the Cau&s;e, for which four or five of them were turn'd out, through the intere&s;t of a certain eminent and &s;en&s;ible Courtier; &s;o now as we are all one People again, our Elders who will generally be made Ju&s;|tices, will have it in their Power to be revenged upon all the Enemies of <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m.</HI> This is the fir&s;t Advantage we &s;hall reap from our firm

Attachment to the P&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, e&s;pecially if we can carry our point at the en|&s;uing Election.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Advantage is we &s;hall have an A&mdash;y G&mdash;l of our own per|&s;ua&s;ion; for it it &s;aid the Per&s;onage that holds it now, and who has go|vern'd our G&mdash;s this ten Years is to re&s;ign for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The third is of greater Con&s;equence &s;till and that is, the pa&s;&s;ing &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters"> Laws in Favour of <HI>Pre&s;bytertani&s;m;</HI> this, be a&s;&s;ured, my Friends, is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="6 letters">ated in our Favour upon the following Conditions's Fir&s;t, that the P&mdash;s Lands be exempted from Taxes forever; and what is Six or Seven Hundred a Year, e&s;pecially when not above one fourth of it will be taken from us <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> as the Burden will fall equally upon other Societies; and we &s;hall reap all the Profit?

<P N="2">2dly. A Law rating every Taxable, of whatever Denomination, to|wards &s;upporting our Mini&s;ters; and you all know how much we ought to have this at Heart, as Numbers of us can &s;carce afford a Dram of Whisky in the Morning.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. A Law obliging every Body to attend our Wor&s;hip under Pain of Corporal Puni&s;hment for the fir&s;t Offence, and hanging for the &s;econd; this will oblige the Heatheni&s;h Quakers; the papi&s;tical Church of <HI>Eng|land;</HI> the ignorant and &s;tupid <HI>Dutch</HI> (whom we have now got fa&s;t in a Halter, and upon who&s;e Credulity we have artfully impo&s;ed, by &s;pread|ing &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable, political Romances about the Country) to attend our places of Wor&s;hip; and will be the happy means of adding many Souls to our Number.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. A Law prohibiting all carnal Conver&s;ation between Men and their Wives on the Sabbath-Day, lea&s;t the Fle&s;h &s;hou'd be more powerfull than the Spirit. For the fir&s;t Offence, &pound;. 5 to the Mini&s;ter; for the &s;econd, Excommunication from the Conver&s;ation of all Mankind, and to be given over to Satan to be buffetted, till ab&s;olv'd by the <HI>Kirk,</HI> according to the Plan laid down by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Knox.</HI> Such my Brethren, are the Advantages we &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly reap, if we are able to carry our point at the en&s;uing Election; for that End is this Meeting appointed, that we may fall upon &s;uch ways and means as will be the mo&s;t likely to accompli&s;h it. Dr <HI>A&mdash;n</HI> and I put <HI>W&mdash;n;</HI> (who you know was ca&s;t out of our <HI>Pre&s;bytaries</HI> for ki&s;&s;ing a Girl behind a Bu&s;h in Sermon time on the Sab|bath) upon writing that &s;tupid Epitaph on Mr. F&mdash;n; and altho' it is &s;tuff'd with &s;uch palpable Fal&s;hoods, yet the ignorant <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are no Witches, &s;wallow it down with the greate&s;t Avidity.

<P>I have one Que&s;tion to ask, and that is&mdash; how can all the&s;e good Laws be obtain'd in favor of our Church, if we choo&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI> to re|pre&s;ent us?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Moderator</HI> reply'd, that there were a good many <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> who would be return'd: but it was not material who were cho&s;en this Year, if they cou'd but get <HI>F&mdash;n G&mdash;y</HI> and <HI>R&mdash;s</HI> out, with two or three others; the re&s;t wou'd be like a Body without a Head.&mdash;And they knew if they cou'd but put in whom they pleas'd this Year, by Virtue of the &s;ame Strength, they wou'd be able to put them out the next. For if, &s;ays he, we can change them for one Year, we can always do it, &s;o that we may fill the Hou&s;e with <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The grand points we have to carry is to be unanimous among our|&s;elves, and to blind the <HI>Dutch</HI> by all the Political Du&s;t we can rai&s;e; by encrea&s;ing their Prejudices again&s;t the King; alarming their Fears; and trying to per&s;uade them that the <HI>Pr&mdash;r</HI> is a Prince.</P>

<P>I believe that will be hard to do. I &s;ounded one of them who is a Neighbour of mine upon that Subject the other Day, and the Fellow very abruptly told me, that the fir&s;t Thing he did when he came into this Coun|try, was to &s;wear Allegiance to <HI>King George,</HI> not the P&mdash;r; that <HI>King George</HI>'s Father and Mother were both <HI>Dutch</HI> People, and he wou'd &s;pend the la&s;t Drop of his Blood for them;&mdash;that they might talk of the A&s;&s;embly as they pleas'd, but <HI>Dutch</HI> Men knew the Worth of Money as well as their Neighbours; that no Body cou'd per&s;uade him that it was right for the Country People to pay the P&mdash;r's Taxes; that he lived clo&s;e by one of the P&mdash;s Manors, as fine Land as any in the Province;&mdash;

that it was rated no higher than &s;ome barren &s;tony Hills in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not worth Six-pence an Acre;&mdash;that he knew the&s;e Manors had &s;erv'd upon the Frontiers, as &s;o many lurking Places for the &s;culking <HI>Indians</HI> to mur|der them;&mdash;that had they been &s;ettled, they cou'd have made a better De|fence again&s;t the Inroads of the Savages; but if they are kept unimprov'd, all the Laws or Treaties in the World will never protect the back Inhabi|tants, nor give them one Hour's Security from tho&s;e Barbarians, who have always a &s;afe Retreat in the&s;e Wilderne&s;&s;es inter&s;pers'd among the People, and kept to all Appearance for that U&s;e.

<P>Your Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Dutchman</HI> brings to my Mind &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e I had the other Day with one of my Elders, a Man of tolerable good Sen&s;e and hone&s;t, but extreamely opinionative, proud, loquacious, and one who gives me more trouble in the Se&s;&s;ions, when any Matters of Fornication, Adultery, Slander, Drunkenne&s;s or Lying is di&s;cu&s;s'd among us (which alas! is very frequent] than all the Re&s;t of the Elders put together.</P>
<P>Having called a Se&s;&s;ions about the en&s;uing Election, I expatiated upon the Advantages we &s;hou'd reap in oppo&s;ing the K&mdash;g, and adhering to the P&mdash;r; the many di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of his Favor he hath &s;hour'd upon <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in particular, above any other Denomination in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania&punc;</HI> and that ever memorable Charter for the Incorporation of <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Mini&s;ters to rai&s;e a Fund for their Widows and poor <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters;</HI>&mdash;(you know that is to rai&s;e a Fund for all of us, for we can all ju&s;tly plead Poverty; his own liberal Donation, and the generous En|couragement he gave to the Collection when our Agent was in <HI>England.</HI> Here I was going on with a Di&s;&s;ertation as long as a Sacrament Sermon, and as much to the Purpo&s;e, when I was interrupted by my impertinent Elder, who undertook to be Mouth for the re&s;t of his Brethren, and &s;aid.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I never under&s;tood that the Clergy had any Commi&s;&s;ion from Heaven to &s;ettle the Affairs of this World; I always imagin'd their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to prepare us for the next: Whenever they attempt to regulate King|doms and Provinces, I am always &s;u&s;picious thrt they are making fair Weather with Satan in order to enjoy tho&s;e earthly Kingdoms them&s;elves, which are rejected with the greate&s;t contempt by our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>In the Days of Darkne&s;s and Super&s;tition, the Clergy had engro&s;s'd all the <HI>civil</HI> as well as <HI>religious</HI> Authority in <HI>Europe.</HI> It was the Glory
<PB N="32" REF="009703_0027_0F7A450EB0BF7A18">
however of <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m</HI> at the Reformation to &s;trip them in a great Mea&s;ure of both. In every Attempt they have made &s;ince to regain their lo&s;t Influence they have generally failed; and altho' one would think that the pa&s;t Experience of our Forefathers might convince the Mini&s;ters of this Day, and deter them from &s;uch unparallel'd pride, and con&s;um|mate Folly; yet, &s;uch is the Nature of ambitious Prie&s;ts, that they are ever re&s;tle&s;s, like the foaming Sea, ca&s;ting forth Mire and Dirt, till ei|ther a few of them domineer over the re&s;t, or the whole over us that are Laymen.</P>
<P>The Motive that led me to the&s;e Reflections, was the Con&s;ideration of that imperious <HI>Je&s;uitical Bull</HI> &s;ent forth from our Mini&s;ters in <HI>Philadel|phia</HI> to their Brethren in the Country.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e we have no great Affection for <HI>Kingly Government,</HI> yet why our Mini&s;ters &s;hou'd be &s;uch &s;hallow Politicians as to publi&s;h this to the World under the mild Reign of <HI>George the Third,</HI> who has never done us any Injury, is a Piece of Prie&s;tcraft that I can't account for? Can it ren|der us acceptable to the <HI>King</HI> to proclaim to the World, that our Antip|parhy is to the "Form of his Government," of which he can by no Means dive&s;t him&s;elf, without renouncing his Crown? Surely by this De|claration, viz. "as long as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Circular Letter in No. 2 of the <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s.</HI></NOTE> <HI>form of his Government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts</HI> &amp;c. we declare our&s;elves not only his, but his <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> inveterate Foes.</P>
<P>Neither was it prudent in them to in&s;inuate that we &s;hou'd be <HI>"re|duced,"</HI> by &s;uch a Change; &s;urely they did not mean like half-pay Officers, broken Soldiers, or Wealthy Farmers reduced to Want and Beggary through the Calamities of the Times, and who had Nothing to live upon but daily <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. I am &s;till more a&s;toni&s;h'd when reading their Letter; I find them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch di&s;re&s;pectful Thoughts of our <HI>mo&s;t gracious Sovereign,</HI> as to compare him to a Rat-Catcher by indecently &s;aying he wou'd make <HI>"Traps,"</HI> to catch the poor and worthy Inhabitants of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania!</HI> I love our Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, and therefore blu&s;h and &s;hudder at the Con&s;equences of &s;uch ra&s;h and di&s;loyal Conduct. Men who can make &s;o free with their Sovereign, may well take upon them to lay their peremptory commands upon their Fellow Mini&s;ters, who are their Equals in all re&s;pects, in this thundering and arbirary Tone,
<Q>And let no Man per&s;uade you to the contrary,</Q>
Did ever the <HI>Pope</HI> exceed this in his Conclave? Whatever Mandates they are pleas'd to &s;end us we mu&s;t &s;wallow them down implicitly by Whole&s;ale, without Examination, and not even &s;uffer any Man to Rea&s;on with us on the Subject: Surely if a few Mini&s;ters in Town, who are of a pa&s;&s;ionate Di&s;po&s;ition with &s;uch horrid Pre&s;umption' diametrically oppo&s;ite to our Di&s;cipline, and the &s;ublime precepts of the Chri&s;tian Religion lord it with &s;uch a high Hand over their Brethren in the Country, what will our Mini&s;ters do over us that are Laymen? As for my part I am determin'd to be a free Agent and think for my&s;elf; I have read all the Pamphlets and Speeches that have been publi&s;h'd on the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, and am fully of Opinion that Religion has nothing to do with it; I am al&s;o per&s;uaded, that if our Mini&s;ters &s;pent

the Time, that they trot about the Country after Politicks in correcting their Sermons and adapting them in a better Manner than they have lat|terly done to the U&s;e and Benefit of their Hearers it wou'd be much more for our Edification and their Credit. Can it redound to the Honor of our Profe&s;&s;ion, the Time our Mini&s;ters ought to &s;pend in reading and &s;tudy|ing the Scriptures, is taken up in Writing Lampoons, Satires and Libels upon the honorable and worthy Speaker of the A&s;&s;embly in this Province, and his Son the Governor of a Neighbouring one, and who has been no way concern'd in our late Controver&s;ies? How can our Brethren in the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> ever with any Face reque&s;t that Gentleman to do them any Kindne&s;s, when we here have ba&s;ely in&s;ulted him in the mo&s;t &s;currilous and inhu|man Manner? what is the unpardonable Crime our <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> has com|mitted? Why that <HI>great one</HI> of contending with the P&mdash;r, whether he &s;hall pay his own taxes or we &s;hall pay them for him; I confe&s;s the rea&s;on of my leaving my native Country was to get clear of oppre&s;ive Land lords, and paying of Tithes;&mdash;And while the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> is defending me from the fir&s;t, I &s;hall always admire their Firmne&s;s and Integrity; neither &s;hall I ever willingly contribute to the latter, tho' it were to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of you Sir (&s;peaking to the Moderator) in this Congregation. I love my Profe&s;&s;ion very well, but I love my Liberty better, and think it much more to the Advantage of the Laity to have the Clergy under their Thumb, than the Clergy to have us under theirs.</P>
<P>Shew me an in&s;tance in the Annals of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> where the pre&s;ent Royal Family has attempted to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Circular Letter.</NOTE> "abridge" the religious Li|berties of the People; or taken any Advantage of their inte&s;tine Com|motions to lay any Hard&s;hips upon the Con&s;ciences of their Subjects? Can any one believe that the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> don't love their own Liberties, and the Priviliges of their Con&s;tituents better than the P&mdash;r and his Tools, who wou'd rather &s;ee the Province overflowed in a Deluge of Blood than pay his proportionable Share of the Taxes? It is my humble Opinion that if &s;ix and thirty Turks were on the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> in Place of the pre&s;ent Members, that the &s;ame innate love of Freedom wou'd prompt them to &s;truggle for the Liberties of their Country, and pur&s;ue the <HI>&s;ame mea&s;ures while the &s;ame Bone</HI> of Contention &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.&mdash;That Bone may now be removed by an Ap|plication to the <HI>Crown</HI> to take us under it's immediate Protection, and &s;end us Governors to pa&s;s &s;uch Bills as will lay an <HI>equitable Tax</HI> upon all Lands without any Exceptions?&mdash;And were all the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> to be cho&s;en from among my Countrymen, and Brother Elders to-morrow, were they to give up that &s;ingle point, of an <HI>equitable Tax</HI> upon all E&s;|tates, even tho' they &s;hou'd procure an E&s;tabli&s;hment in Lieu of it for our Mini&s;ters [which by the by, wou'd be no Advantage to us Laymen) I wou'd be one of the fir&s;t that wou'd hang them up as high as Gilderoy, and &s;end their Quarters into all parts of the Province by way of Memento to their Succe&s;&s;ors.&mdash;Here I interrupted my Elder, for I cou'd not bear his Impudence no longer, and a&s;&s;ured him if he was not &s;ilent in an in&s;tant I wou'd cain him; he acknowledg'd, without making any other Reply,

<P>What do you &s;ay? The Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> have not a Right to Petition their <HI>King</HI> a|gain&s;t the Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion of one of their Fellow Subjects, and pray him to deliver them out of Slavery, by taking the Govern|ment into his own Hands, re&s;erving to the People their Rights granted by Charter. Pray if the Repre&s;entatives of a whole Province have no Right to propo&s;e or Stipulate with the Crown in Matters of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to their Con&s;tituents. How came <HI>William Penn</HI> to have a Right in behalf of one Man only, and that him&s;elf, to propo&s;e the Sale of this Government to <HI>Queen Ann,</HI> and Stipulate with her about

the Price; for he at fir&s;t ask'd &s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds more for it, than he afterwards agree'd to take&mdash;and at the Crowns rejecting his fir&s;t offer, he was but in the &s;ame Situation which he was in before he made it; we don't under&s;tand that the <HI>Queen</HI> thought he had no Right, to make Propo&s;als in regard to his Rights, but left it to two of her Mini&s;ters to agree with him as they &s;hould think proper; which will undoubtedly be the Ca&s;e, with regard to the Petition now &s;ent home: Either the <HI>King</HI> will accept the Government on the Terms propo&s;ed; or reject it, and leave us as we are until other Terms can be agreed on.</P>

<P>I make no doubt but that the <HI>King</HI> will accept the Government, upon its being offer'd to him, but the Re&s;ervation of our Liberties is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch faint Terms, that the <HI>King</HI> will take little or no notice of them; and on the change will new moddel them over again, where|by we &s;hall loo&s;e our Rights.</P>

<P>Herein you are again mi&s;taken, for there will be no new Mod|deling, as the Government is already &s;old, and One Thou&s;and Pounds of the purcha&s;e Money paid to <HI>William Penn</HI> at the Time of Sale; and if that was not the Ca&s;e, all our Priviledges are confirmed, either by the Royal Charter, or by Acts of A&s;&s;embly tran&s;mitted home and con|firmed by the Crown, &s;o that the <HI>King,</HI> was he inclin'd to Abridge us of any of our Priviledg<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> on accepting the Government, which I think no Man can po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e, has not that Power to do it.</P>

For my Part, I always under&s;tood it as a Maxim among&s;t <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that no Man is to pay a Sum of Money without receiving in Con&s;ideration that, for which the Money was paid; if then that Maxim be true, and we pay for the <HI>Government,</HI> mu&s;t not that <HI>Go|vernment</HI> be ours, and we have a Right to Elect our Governors as we do our A&s;&s;emblymen.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN making the tour of <HI>Europe</HI> I had the plea&s;ure of writing to you la&s;t from <HI>Belgrade</HI> the Capital of <HI>Hungary;</HI> I have &s;ince had the cu|rio&s;ity, (before I enter <HI>Holand</HI>) to vi&s;it <HI>Tran&s;ylvania,</HI> a Province formerly under the Dominion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> but now belonging to the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany;</HI> and as its <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Waywode,</HI> the name given to the Prince or Governor.</NOTE> <HI>Waywode</HI> is almo&s;t independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Per&s;ons of all Nations, and of every profe&s;&s;ion under Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made a purcha&s;e of the &s;oil from the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who were the original Proprietors; he has al&s;o obtain'd a grant from the <HI>Emperor</HI> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <HI>Waywode</HI> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great di&s;tance from Court, to go|vern the Inhabitants, who flocked from all Quarters to &s;ettle the Coun|try under the &s;anction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the pre&s;ervation of their Religion and Liberties, with an ab&s;olute &s;way.</P>
<P>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friend|&s;hip; but within the&s;e ten years pa&s;t, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them. The original cau&s;e of which is &s;aid to
<PB N="39" REF="009703_0034_0F7A4514CC049578">
be, the <HI>Waywodes</HI> taking the advantage of the &s;implicity and ignorance of the Natives in purcha&s;ing their Lands, with regard to their nature and &s;ituation, as well as de&s;cription; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they &s;old. This, (with the trade driven on among them by &s;ome Chri&s;tians, who fir&s;t made them drunk, and then de|frauded them, and pro&s;tituted their Females,)&mdash;a Sy&s;tem of religion un|known to them and their Forefathers di&s;gu&s;ted them to &s;uch a degree, that they immediately declared War. The <HI>Turks</HI> joining them, there was then a nece&s;&s;ity for the <HI>Waywode</HI> and his Subjects to rai&s;e money. The Delegates being a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult the welfare of the Country, in&s;i&s;ted that a Tax &s;hou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <HI>Waywode</HI> agreed, upon condition, that all his own &s;hou'd be ex|empted, as he had large flocks all over the Country. This, the Dele|gates refus'd, becau&s;e his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own: He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine. This con&s;truction however the Delegates wou'd not ad|mit of. A long di&s;pute then en&s;ued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls &s;hou'd be taxed, which he could not believe was ju&s;t, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd- they &s;aw no rea&s;on why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves &s;hou'd be exempted, and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time laid wa&s;te the Frontiers with fire and &s;word. This inte&s;tine di&s;pute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting di&s;po&s;ition of the Lord of the &s;oil, that he wou'd rather &s;ee a general Ma&s;&s;acre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than &s;uffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</P>
<P>A few of the well affected Natives to the Government, threw them|&s;elves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were a&s;&s;ign'd for the maintain|ance of &s;ome, and others were &s;upported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the &s;tare of <HI>Tran&s;ylvania</HI> upon my fir&s;t arrival at the Capital.</P>
<P>I waited upon his Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle aged Man of &s;mall &s;tature; &s;ur|rounded with half a Dozen of boys who were called Prime Mini&s;ters of State; four young Nymphs of Circa&s;&s;ian breed, and a Calidonian wry nec|ed Mu&s;ician. The Room was filled with in&s;truments of mu&s;ic. A Vio|lin; a harp&s;ichord; &s;ix Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps. He enquired if I under&s;tood Mu&s;ick; I an&s;wered, &s;ome few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he imme|diately gave me a general invitation to accompany him either to the cha&s;e (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, every day during my &s;tay at <HI>Wei&s;&s;enburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had two days elap&s;ed when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Pi&s;s&mdash;Brute&mdash;tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengeful &s;ect, &s;prung
<PB REF="009703_0035_0F7A4515822B7B20">
from the Turks, and Adoters of <HI>Mahomet</HI> as to ab&s;olute Fate, but nominal Chri&s;tians in &s;ome other re&s;pects, having murder'd the innocent Natives Man Woman and Child, who were &s;ettled in the Country, were in full march to butcher tho&s;e under the protection of the City. In Con&s;equence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however en&s;ued, and the <HI>Waywode,</HI> not only put up with the in&s;ult, but meanly &s;toop'd to carre&s;s the rebels&punc; nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their re&s;entment upon the Delegates of the Province, in&s;tead of him&s;elf. This they agreed to. The Dele|gates had no way to &s;ave them&s;elves from de&s;truction, and pre&s;erve the Government from Anarchy but by appealing to the <HI>Emperor</HI> to be taken under his own protection, and re&s;cued from the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Pi&s;s&mdash; Brute&mdash;tarians, and the Tyranny of the <HI>Waywode,</HI> After this &s;trange re|volution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and tho&s;e, who had bravely and generou&s;ly taken up arms to &s;ave his Excellency's wind-pipe from being &s;ever'd in a thou&s;and pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the in&s;tability of Courts, and the wonderful Wi&s;dom of Mini&s;ters of State! It is &s;aid his Excellency's Mu&s;ical In&s;truments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been di&s;concerted ever &s;ince; be that as it will; a &s;udden re&s;olution was taken to call a Council, wherein it was decreed, that there &s;hou'd no Magi&s;trates hold Commi&s;&s;ions under the Government, who had &s;hewn any Love for the <HI>Emperor;</HI> or was not a Pi&s;s&mdash; Brute&mdash;tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</P>
<P>As I had the happine&s;s to be acquainted with Coun&s;ellor Wi&s;eman, a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Gentleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greate&s;t integrity through all the political &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts that had threatened the de&s;truction of the Province, during the whole time by rea&s;on of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <HI>Turk,</HI> he took the fir&s;t Opportunity after the Council broke up to com|municate to me the &s;ub&s;tance of the rebate upon that important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>His Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one A&s;&s;ert<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">rian in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they &s;eem'd all tinctur'd with a re|bellious di&s;po&s;ition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor him&s;elf. That by their late proceedings, in choo&s;ing &s;uch men to repre&s;ent them, who were his bitter Enemies, and in complaining to the <HI>Emperor</HI> again&s;t him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and either oblig'd to re&s;ign his Government, or throw him&s;elf under the Protection of the grand <HI>Turk;</HI> therefore as they had thus &s;hewn their malicious intentions again&s;t his Admini&s;tration, they were no longer to be enrolled among the Number of his Friends. He al&s;o added, that tho&s;e of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion had behav'd in &s;uch a cold indifferent manner (a few in <HI>Wei&s;&s;en|burgh</HI> excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <HI>Emperor</HI> as him&s;elf;&mdash; that their principles in Religion and the max|ims
<PB N="41" REF="009703_0036_0F7A4516321019E0">
by which they and their Ance&s;tors were govern'd for one Thou&s;and Years, were peculiarly adapted to &s;upport the <HI>Emperial Family</HI>&mdash; that the&s;e things being con&s;ider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his per&s;on, or their general concurrence to his mea&s;ures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be tru&s;ted at &s;uch a critical conjuncture. He therefore de&s;ir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect were to be tru&s;ted as Magi&s;trates in the Government, be&s;ides the Pi&s;s&mdash; Brute&mdash;tarians, a Sect who&s;e principles have ever been diametrically oppo&s;ite to Monarchy; and not only * <HI>&s;worn</HI> Enemies to the <HI>Emperial</HI> Family, but murder'd one of the <HI>Emperors</HI> before his own palace; and have always been the forema&s;t in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd again&s;t his Succe&s;&s;ors ever &s;ince. He al&s;o &s;aid, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to e&s;pou&s;e the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s cau&s;e, and whom he "mark'd" out for puni&s;hment; he wi&s;h'd it cou'd be with the lo&s;s of their heads, in&s;tead of their Commi&s;&s;ions. The Enemies were <HI>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and <HI>Trumponius,</HI> the la&s;t he was &s;ome what &s;orry for, as he &s;uppos'd his Ance&s;tors were great Mu&s;icians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate the po&s;terity, by which &s;ome Nations call a Jews-Harp.</P>
<P>The Generality of the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <HI>Waywode;</HI> but when it came to Coun&s;ellor <HI>Wi&s;eman</HI> to give his opi|nion, he begg'd leave to di&s;&s;ent from the re&s;t of the board; and hoped his Excellency wou'd with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd excu&s;e him, if he differ'd with him in &s;ome of the Political Ob&s;ervations he had ju&s;t now made, and unto which Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</HI> and <HI>Brainle&s;s</HI> his Brother Coun&s;ellors had &s;ignified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a &s;hort time <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of the province he ought to u&s;e every method in his power to cultivate a good under&s;tanding with the people;&mdash;that that as a &s;pirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate &s;uch an exten&s;ive province, &s;tripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the Way of either gaining the good opinion of tho&s;e who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the mo&s;t &s;editious; that tho' his Excellency was &s;en&s;ible, how little either him|&s;elf, or the Council troubled them&s;elves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew) there was a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up external ap|pearances; that it was a u&s;eful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;&mdash;that if therefore he abandoned the profe&s;&s;ion of it, he wou'd be held in univer|&s;al di&s;e&s;teem by all its Profe&s;&s;ors &mdash;that if he appeared more Zeal|ous for one &s;ect than another, a general Jealou&s;y wou'd take place a|mong the re&s;t, and perhap unite them all again&s;t him; that if this &s;hou'd happen, the Pi&s;s-Brute&mdash;tarians were not the tenth of his Subjects, and con&s;equently could not &s;upport him again&s;t the other nine;&mdash;that if he made an impartial di&s;tribution of places of Profit and Honour in the Go|vernment, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd them in all their equitable demands, the <HI>Em|peror</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="009703_0037_0F7A451864CA1358">
wou'd have no objection towards the continuing of him in his <HI>Vice-royalty;</HI> no complaints cou'd have any weight again&s;t him; his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps &s;ave him the expence und trouble of a long Journey to defend him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>A&s;&s;ertorians,</HI> the raking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Predece&s;&s;ors wou'd, perhaps, effectually regain their Friend&s;hip; make them drop the pro&s;ecution of their Appeal: and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to di&s;oblige. <HI>Pottonius</HI> (who appears to be particularly &s;ingled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf this twenty Years pa&s;t, for his Integrity, in faithfully di&s;charging the Office of a Magi&s;trate; his fortune places him above the fear of affection of Mankind, in the de|&s;tribution of Ju&s;tice; and therefore he does you Excellency as much ho|nor in accepting of the Commi&s;&s;ion, as you can do him in giving it. As to tho&s;e of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Prie&s;ts, and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater lengths to &s;erve you, than any other Sect among us in &s;ome par|ticulars,</P>
<P>Have they not abandoned their former Principles, violated every obli|ligation that was either civil of &s;acred, or that bound them by the ties of Con&s;cience or honor to be faithful to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in order to &s;upport your Cau&s;e? Have they not pro&s;tituted their Temple, (a place &s;olemnly de|dicated for pious u&s;es) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in?
