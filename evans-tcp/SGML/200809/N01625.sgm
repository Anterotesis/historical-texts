<HEAD>SERMON, I. Shewing the Vertue of CHRISTS Blood to Clean&s;e from Sin.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>I. Epi&s;tle of JOHN, I.7. la&s;t part.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash; <HI>And the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t|his Son clean&s;eth us from all Sin.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e Words we have the com|mendation of the blood of Chri&s;t. By the blood of Chri&s;t we are not to un|der&s;tand the natural blood of Chri&s;t: if a Man had kept &s;ome Ounces of that when it ran out of his &s;ide, it would have done him no good: but the meaning is, the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially his bloody death. The commendation of it is, (1.) That it has an Efficacy to clean&s;e us from Sin. Sin is a pollution and &s;tain: it renders Men offen&s;ive to God, it makes them filthy in the Eye of God; it expo&s;es them to
<PB N="2" REF="001930_0003_0FBA1D1CA6A572A8">Gods wrath: but the blood of Chri&s;t clean|&s;eth us: Rev. 1.5. <HI>Je&s;us Christ wa&s;heth us from our &s;ins in his own blood.</HI> (2.) The greatne&s;s of the efficacy: it clean&s;eth away all &s;in. Some Sins are of a double die, &s;car|let Sins; &s;ome have committed a Multitude of Sins, and nothing el&s;e can clean&s;e from any one Sin, but this clean&s;eth from all. This is amplifyed by the rea&s;on, <HI>His Son:</HI> if he had been a Man, if he had been only the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> his blood would have had no &s;uch vertue: but he being the Son of God, his blood clean&s;eth from all Sin.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>There is Mighty Vertue in the blood of Chri&s;t to Expiate the guilt of Sin.</Q>
<P>The Law of God condemns for Sin. Rom. 6.23. <HI>The wages of &s;in is death.</HI> It brings Men under obligation to &s;uffer Eternal Puni&s;h|ment. All Men by Sin are expo&s;ed to the wrath of God. This begets a great deal of di&s;quietment in the hearts of &s;ome Men, they would gladly be put into a way to be deli|vered from the guilt of Sin; they have tryed &s;ome methods and they don't effect the thing, Prayers and Tears will not do; but this Doctrine gives an account what will do: There is vertue in the blood of Chri&s;t to do it. Some things have a tendency to work this and that Effect, but they are not always
<PB N="3" REF="001930_0004_0FBA1D1FE30852A0">powerful; but there is worth enough in the blood of Chri&s;t to take away Sin. Other things are no ran&s;om for the Soul; but they that have an intere&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t are delivered from the guilt of Sin. It is all one whether Mens Sins be more or &s;ewer, whi|ther more or le&s;s heinous, the blood of Chri&s;t will wa&s;h them clean. Meats and drinks have vertue to nouri&s;h Men, Clothes have vertue to warm them, Phy&s;ick may have vertue to heal them, but the blood of Chri&s;t has vertue to clean&s;e them from their Sins. If a Man have Money, he may purcha&s;e Land or Cattle or Corn, but he cannot purcha&s;e Pardon, but the blood of Chri&s;t will procure the Pardon of Sin. Eph. 1.7. <HI>In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins.</HI> Rev. 5.9. <HI>Thon ha&s;t Redeemed us to God by thy blood.</HI> Wi&s;dom is a defence and Money is a defence, but the blood of Chri&s;t is a defence again&s;t the cur&s;e of the Law: Gal. 3.13. <HI>He hath Redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the Law, being made a cur&s;e for us.</HI></P>
<P>For the proof of this we may con&s;ider the&s;e Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. Argu. <HI>The Father would not have put Christ on this Service, if his Death would not have prevailed for the Pardon of Sin.</HI> Men were the In&s;truments of putting Chri&s;t to death, but the thing was according to the coun&s;el of God: Act. 2.23. <HI>He was delivered by the determinate coun&s;el and &s;ore-knowledge of
<PB N="4" REF="001930_0005_0FBA1D2135D4A7A8">God.</HI> Yea, God appointed him to die for our Redemption: God made him a Prie&s;t to offer up this Sacrifice: P&s;al. 110.4. <HI>Thou art a Prie&s;t for ever after the order of Melchizedeck.</HI> God commanded him to lay down his life: Joh. 10.18. <HI>This Commandment have I recei|ved of my Father.</HI> God called him to &s;uffer upon our account: I&s;ai. 53.6. <HI>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</HI> From hence may we conclude the vertue of Chri&s;ts blood to take away Sin. It was a great thing for the Son of God to &s;uffer: there never was any other &s;uch thing from the foundation of the World, nor ever will be again. The dig|nity of his Per&s;on is infinite, and the love of his Father exceeding great; and there is no fair account, why the Father &s;hould be wil|ling, to lay this puni&s;hment on him, if it would not have had a mighty efficacy for the taking away the guilt of Sin. Would God lay this upon him for nothing, or for a &s;mall matter? Certainly it mu&s;t be upon &s;ome great de&s;ign: God fore-&s;aw the great Good that would come thereby. And would the Son have been willing to undergo &s;uch great Sor|row, if it would not availed for the Expia|tion of abundance of Sin? He knew that many would be redeemed thereby. Math. 20.28. <HI>The Son of Man came to give his Life a ran&s;ome for many.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Argu. <HI>God promi&s;ed to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that his Death &s;hould be accepted for the doing away of Sin.</HI> Chri&s;t did not &s;uffer under an uncer|tainty,
<PB N="5" REF="001930_0006_0FBA1D2389316C90">whether his death would &s;ignify any great matter, whether any number of Men would be the better for it. God gave a great number to him to redeem, and promi&s;ed that his Death &s;hould be accepted as the price of their Redemption: I&s;ai. 53.10, 11, 12.&mdash; <HI>If he make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed,</HI> &amp;c. So I&s;ai. 49.6. <HI>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou may&s;t be my &s;alvation to the ends of the earth.</HI> A number of all Nations &s;hall be &s;aved by him: P&s;al. 2.7, 8. P&s;al. 72.17. <HI>Men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him, all Nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> And what can be a &s;tronger tie, and greatee &s;ecu|rity than the promi&s;e of God? Chri&s;t on the incouragement of this promi&s;e undertook this Service, and God that made &s;uch pro|mi&s;es before he died, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch an e&s;timation of his Sufferings, will not de&s;pi&s;e them now they are accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="3">3. Argu. <HI>From the Sacrifices that were offered of old.</HI> Sacrifices were offered up from the beginning of the World. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.3, 4. And this practice was continued in the Church for Four Thou&s;and Years: there were daily Sacrifices, Sacrifices for the Sabbaths, for the beginnings of the Months, and Yearly Sacri|fices: there were burnt-offerings, tre&s;pa&s;s|offerings, &s;in-offerings, peace offerings, free|will offerings &amp; vows: Multitudes of Crea|tures were offered up in Sacrifice to God: twenty and two thou&s;and Oxen, and an hun|dred
<PB N="6" REF="001930_0007_0FBA1D24C3ABED18">and twenty thou&s;and Sheep at the dedi|cation of the Temple: there was much ex|pence and labour in Sacrificing; and the&s;e were all types and &s;hadows of Chri&s;t: <HI>Col.</HI> 2.17. The&s;e Sacrifices could not purge away &s;in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.4. God did not regard them but as they were types of Chri&s;t. Heb. 10.5. <HI>When he cometh into the World, he &s;aith, &s;acri|fice and offering thou woulde&s;t not, but a body ha&s;t thou prepared me.</HI> The de&s;ign of the&s;e Sacri|fices was to repre&s;ent the Death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to in&s;truct the World about Chri&s;ts Death, to be monitors and remembrancers of the Death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that &s;o the People of God might be continually exerci&s;ing faith on him. And would God have done this if there had not been wonderful vertue in this blood? Why &s;hould they be taught with &s;uch labour and expence to depend upon his death if there were not &s;uch glorious vertue in it? I may add to this the con&s;ideration of other types: the pa&s;sover was a type of Chri&s;t: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.7. So was the brazen Serpent: <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14, 15. And the legal wa&s;hings: God took abundant occa&s;ion to in&s;truct them in the vertue of Chri&s;ts blood.</P>
<P N="4">4. Argu. <HI>From the Sacraments of the New Te&s;tament.</HI> Bapti&s;m &s;hews the efficacy of Chri&s;ts death unto Salvation: thereby is held forth our fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t in his Suffe|rings. Rom. 6.3. <HI>So many of us as have been baptized into Je&s;us Christ, were baptized into his
<PB N="7" REF="001930_0008_0FBA1D2743640EA8">death.</HI> Bapti&s;m is a Seal of the doctrine of faith in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Adult Per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ed their Faith in Chri&s;t before they were baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.36, 37. Bapti&s;m repre&s;ents the wa&s;hing away of the guilt of Sin by the blood of Chri&s;t. So we are taught the &s;ame by the Lords Supper. Therein his death is repre&s;ented as a violent death, and as on our account: Matt. 26.28. <HI>This is my blood which is &s;hed for many for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> 1 Cor. 11.24. <HI>This is my body which is broken for you.</HI> Chri&s;t has appointed, that in this way his death &s;hould be &s;hewed forth, till he comes, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26. And &s;urely it had not been worth the while to have appoin|ted Signs of this unto the end of the World, if it had not procured Salvation. The Wine in the Lords Supper is called <HI>His blood of the New Te&s;tament,</HI> Math. 26.28. becau&s;e it pur|cha&s;es the ble&s;&s;ings of the New Te&s;tament. In the&s;e Ordinances God &s;hews that it is much upon his heart to &s;trengthen our faith in the blood of Chri&s;t. Here we &s;ee &s;olemn Ordinances founded on the doctrine of Salva|tion by the Sufferings of Chri&s;t: if this doctrine were not true there would be no oc|ca&s;ion for the&s;e Ordinances. God has not appointed any Ordinance, that &s;hould be like the &s;tock, <HI>a doctrine of Vanities,</HI> as the phra&s;e is, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.8. God needs no &s;uch wor&s;hip as is not built on a real foundation. If this doctrine were not true, the Sacraments would be a meer mockery.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="8" REF="001930_0009_0FBA1D2B096D9AD0">
5. Argu. <HI>God doth direct us to tru&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> We have many invitations in the Scripture to tru&s;t in him. Math. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> And &s;urely God will not with &s;eeming love draw us into a &s;nare, will not with great appearance of love per&s;wade us to build upon a &s;andy founda|tion Yea al&s;o he commands us to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t. 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is his Command|ment that we believe on the Name of his Son Je|&s;us Christ.</HI> And will God require us to put an honour upon Chri&s;t that he is not wor|thy of? Will he command us to flatter our &s;elves and tru&s;t in that which will not &s;ave us? Will God command us to do, that which we cannot do, except we be out of our wits. If it be not &s;a&s;e to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, we could not do it, unle&s;s we were under a de|lu&s;ion: it would be an hard le&s;&s;on to be bound to do that, which there was no rea|&s;on for. Yea, God commands us upon pain of damnation to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t: Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already, be|cau&s;e he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI> But if there be no &s;afety in believing on him, there is no rea|&s;on that we &s;hould be puni&s;hed for not be|lieving on him. Will God damn Men for not building their hopes for Heaven upon the Sand? will he ca&s;t them into Hell for not tru&s;ting in a broken reed? Further, this com|mand is inforced with a promi&s;e of Salvation.
<PB N="9" REF="001930_0010_0FBA1D2DC6CC7698">Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life.</HI> But God will not reward Men with Eternal life, for tru&s;ting in that which hath no &s;aving vertue in it.</P>
<P>Que&s;tion. <HI>How comes there to be &s;uch vertue in the blood of Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall An&s;wer this in Four Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>I. PROP. <HI>CHRIST Suffered the Cur&s;e of the Law.</HI> That is, the evil that the Law threatned. God was bound to execute the cur&s;e for Sin: Math. 5.18. <HI>No jot or tittle &s;hall pa&s;s from the Law, but all must be fulfilled.</HI> And accordingly the wrath of God fell on Chri&s;t, Sin was puni&s;hed in him, he did not bear a part of the cur&s;e, but the cur&s;e: Gal. 3.13. <HI>He hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e being made a cur&s;e for us.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He Suffered the Cur&s;e of the Law in his Body.</HI> They that &s;uffer for them&s;elves mu&s;t &s;uffer in their bodies: be&s;ide what they &s;uffer in their bodies here, their bodies mu&s;t &s;uffer in Hell: Math. 10.28. <HI>Fear him that can ca&s;t both Body and Soul into Hell.</HI> Therefore they mu&s;t ri&s;e from the dead, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.29. <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.2: The Body is a partaker in Sin and therefore it mu&s;t partake in Suffering. So Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not only die for us, that would not &s;erve the turn, but he died an accur&s;ed death. That was &s;ignifyed by that Law: Deut. 21.23. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that hangeth on a tree.</HI> So
<PB N="10" REF="001930_0011_0FBA1D2F4B3821A0">Chri&s;t bore a painful and an ignominious death. Phil. 2.8. <HI>He became obedient to death, the death of the cro&s;s.</HI> He endured a great deal of pain. P&s;al. 22.16. <HI>They pierced my hands and my feet.</HI> And he died as a Ma|lefactor. There was a nece&s;&s;ity that he &s;hould endure abundance of pain, becau&s;e he was to redeem us from the pains of Hell. He was cruelly Scourged, and horribly Tormented on the Cro&s;s, that we might be delivered from the bodily Torments of Hell.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He Suffered the Cur&s;e of the Law in his Soul.</HI> The Soul of Chri&s;t was filled with &s;orrow. Math. 26.38. <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death.</HI> He had a terrible &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God in his Soul. He did not &s;uffer much of this in the time of his Publick Mini&s;try; but about and in the time of his death, he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of Gods wrath. As &s;ometimes Godly Men do enjoy the &s;en&s;e of Gods favour, &s;o Chri&s;t endured the &s;en&s;e of Gods wrath. God was not angry with Chri&s;t for taking his Office upon him, but for our Sins. And Chri&s;t Je&s;us had a deep &s;en&s;e how God was provoked by the Sins of the Elect, and that the guilt of all tho&s;e Sins was tran&s;lated un|to him. Gods wrath did burn again&s;t him, God looked on him as the guilty Per&s;on: God looked upon him as the object of vin|dictive Ju&s;tice: and he was pur&s;ued by Di|vine Vengeance for tho&s;e Sins: I&s;ai. 53.6. <HI>And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of
<PB N="11" REF="001930_0012_0FBA1D3140F938C8">us all,</HI> &amp;c. 11. v. <HI>He &s;hall &s;ee of the travel of his Soul.</HI> This was the principal part of the puni&s;hment of Sin; this made Chri&s;t &s;weat drops of blood: this was typifyed by that fire on the Altar that did con&s;ume the Sacrifices.</P>
<P>Hereby Chri&s;t &s;uffered the &s;ub&s;tance of that which was due to us. There was no need that Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer the &s;ame in all re|&s;pects, that we &s;hould have &s;uffered, if we had born the puni&s;hment of our own Sins; but it was needful that he &s;hould &s;uffer the Sub&s;tance of our puni&s;hment, therefore it is &s;aid that he endured the cur&s;e: Gal. 3.13. <HI>He was made a cur&s;e for us.</HI> He came to fulfil the Law, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.17. Chri&s;t being our &s;urety was bound to pay our debt; and God did not abate him any thing of the extremity of the cur&s;e that was due to us. He &s;uffered the puni&s;hment of our iniquities, and an&s;wered the challenges of Ju&s;tice. 1 Pet. 2.24. <HI>He bore our &s;ins in his own body upon the tree.</HI></P>
<P>II. PROP. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us who Suffered was the Eternal Son of GOD.</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us was honourable on the account of the excellencies of his humane Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> his Wi&s;dom and his Holine&s;s, but the great dignity of Chri&s;t is, that he was the Son of GOD. This cha|racter is given to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in the <HI>Old Te&s;ta|ment.</HI> P&s;al. 45.6. <HI>Thy throne O God is for ever and ever.</HI> I&s;ai. 9.6. <HI>He is the Mighty God.</HI> And the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> doth con&s;tant|ly a&s;&s;ert it. Math. 3.17. <HI>This is my beloved &s;on.</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>He is the brightne&s;s of his glory,
<PB N="12" REF="001930_0013_0FBA1D36C5C45180">and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</HI> And the works of Creation are attributed to him. Indeed he &s;uffered in his humane Nature on|ly, the divine Nature is not capable of &s;uffe|ring; the divine Nature can't &s;uffer pain or grief: at the time when Chri&s;t was upon the Cro&s;s in the greate&s;t Extremity, the divine Nature was in perfect felicity. But yet his Sufferings were the Sufferings of the Son of God. If one part of a Man &s;uffers, the Man &s;uffers. Indeed the humane Nature is not properly a part of Chri&s;t, yet it is per&s;onally united to him; hence the &s;ufferings of the humane Nature are the &s;ufferings of God. 1 Cor. 2.8. <HI>They crucifyed the Lord of glory.</HI> Acts 3.15. <HI>They killed the Prince of Life. He that was in the form of God &s;uffered the death of the cro&s;s,</HI> Phil. 2.7, 8.</P>
<P>Hence it follows that his temporary &s;uffe|rings were Equivalent to our Eternal &s;uffe|rings. Chri&s;t Je&s;us was in a &s;tate of humili|ation, all the while he was on the Earth, but the extremity of his &s;ufferings were but about a Night and a Day, yet the&s;e did an&s;wer &s;uf|ficiently for our Eternal &s;ufferings. If we had &s;uffered in our own Per&s;ons, we mu&s;t have &s;uffered for ever. Math. 26.41. <HI>Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire.</HI> But his &s;uffe|rings were but temporary, yet they are Equi|valent to ours, becau&s;e of the dignity of his Per&s;on. We were finite Per&s;ons, and He an infinite. Our &s;ufferings mu&s;t have been in|finite in duration, and His were infinite in
<PB N="13" REF="001930_0014_0FBA1D38944BC148">re&s;pect of the dignity of his Per&s;on. Finite creatures cannot bear infinite puni&s;hment in a finite time: but an infinite Per&s;on may bear infinite puni&s;hment in a little time. The &s;ufferings of an infinite Per&s;on, have an in|finite value, and &s;ufferings that are of an in|finite value are equal to the &s;ufferings of meer Men for ever. Acts 20.28. <HI>God has purcha&s;ed the Church with his own blood.</HI> Heb. 9.14. <HI>How much more &s;hall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God, purge your Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>III. PROP. <HI>Chri&s;t who &s;uffered was per|fectly holy.</HI> Many other Men are imperfectly holy, but Chri&s;t was perfectly &s;o: He was not guilty of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: the &s;e|cond <HI>Adam</HI> was not repre&s;ented by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;o not involved in the guilt of his Sin. Other Men come Sinners into the World, but He was holy from his birth. Luke 1.35. <HI>That holy one that &s;hall be born of thee.</HI> Chri&s;t was free from all manner of Sin, both Original and Actual: Heb. 7.26. <HI>He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;eparate from Sinners.</HI> He had great temptations from Men to Sin, but they did not prevail. 1 Pet. 2.23. <HI>When he was reviled, he reviled not again.</HI> He had temptations from Satan, but he did not prevail. Joh. 14.32. <HI>The prince of this World cometh and hath nothing in me.</HI> He always did that which plea&s;ed God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8 29. The mo&s;t famous Men that ever were, were Sin|ners,

<P>Hence, His &s;ufferings might be upon our account. The Lambs that were offered in Sacrifice were to be without &s;pot.

Chri&s;t Je|&s;us in this undertaking was Gods Servant, I&s;ai. 42.1. <HI>Behold my &s;ervant, whom I uphold; mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth.</HI> Chri&s;t was no intruder, He did not thru&s;t him&s;elf into this Service.

<P>For, it is not from the low opinion that you have of your &s;elf that you are afraid, but from the low opinion that you have of Chri&s;t. You &s;ay you are a poor wretched Sinner, you have a bad heart and are extream vile, and run out very much in condemning your &s;elf, as if you had a very humble &s;en&s;e of your own unworthine&s;s, but this is not the thing that hinders your coming to Chri&s;t: Many per&s;ons that have lower thoughts of them&s;elves than you have, do yet venture upon Chri&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding your pretend|ed humility, you have too high thoughts of your &s;elves; but the cau&s;e of your fear is, you are not &s;en&s;ible of the mighty vertue that is in Chri&s;t: it is not becau&s;e you &s;ee your &s;elf a great Sinner, but becau&s;e you don't &s;ee Chri&s;t to be a great Saviour. It is not becau&s;e you have &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of your malady, but becau&s;e you have &s;o little &s;en&s;e of the remedy. Men that are wretched Men are invited to Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>This Doctrine condemns tho&s;e that have a greater value for their own works than for the blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> Some Men make their own works the great foundation of their hope. Luke 18.11, 12. <HI>I am not as other Men, Ex|tortioners, Unju&s;t, Adulterers, or even as this Publican, I fa&s;t twice in the week,</HI> &amp;c. Some Men can depend on their own works without Chri&s;t, but cannot depend on Chri&s;t without their own works. Their great care is to e&s;ta|bli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3. Some becau&s;e of their works, they think God is not angry with them; though their Con|&s;ciences be not healed, yet they are ea&s;ed: &s;ome are &s;triving to get ju&s;tification by works, and are neglecting the offers of Mercy thro' Chri&s;t. You are much out of the way, for there is great vertue in the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001930_0021_0FBA1D458860F948">
Con&s;ider, 1. <HI>You have no Divine Warrant for this.</HI> It is a bold pre&s;umptuous thing to tru&s;t in God without his Word to warrant you. They that go in this way go upon the incouragement of their own carnal rea&s;on: Men have a warrant to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, be|cau&s;e God commands them. 1 Joh. 3.23. <HI>This is his commandment that we believe in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And becau&s;e God invites them: Math. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden.</HI> But where do you find any command to tru&s;t in your own works, or any invitation to do &s;o? or any promi&s;e on that condition? The Scripture is &s;ilent, there is not a tittle that way: You mu&s;t go &s;ome-where el&s;e to find your war|rant; the word of God don't &s;upport that hope: it is a daring thing to tru&s;t in God without any incouragement from him. Men have nothing but bold conjectures, and ra&s;h &s;uppo&s;itions to bear them out therein: they that do &s;o, venture their Souls upon a fooli&s;h imagination.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God declares again&s;t it.</HI> To tru&s;t in God without his word is bad, but to tru&s;t in him again&s;t his word is wor&s;e. God warns them again&s;t it, that it is pre&s;umption with a wit|ne&s;s. To depend upon that as a way of Sal|vation, which God declares to be a way of Damnation, is extream impudence: the foundation of their belief is unbelief. Are we not told that works will not &s;ave Men? Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the deeds of the Law &s;hall no

Be there any &s;olemn war|nings to di&s;courage Men from tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t? Men are afraid though God don't warn them again&s;t it, but they will tru&s;t in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s though warned a|gain&s;t it, as if God je&s;ted with them, when he warned them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Your be&s;t works have matter of condemnati|on in them.</HI> The be&s;t works of Men are &s;in|ful.

Are tho&s;e works meritorious that are puni&s;hable? Do tho&s;e things that de&s;erve Hell, de&s;erve Heaven? Perfect Obe|dience is the price of Heaven, but with what a&s;&s;urance can Men depend on that Obedience which is imperfect? Do Men think that they pay for Heaven by &s;uch works as pur|cha&s;e Hell? Has God changed the price of Heaven? Will &s;uch actions as were wont to provoke the Ju&s;tice of God, now pacify his Ju&s;tice?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Your works don't an&s;wer the Law.</HI> The Law is a &s;tanding rule: As God bound us by his Law, &s;o he bound him&s;elf, he made a Law for him&s;elf, and will not depart from it.

Works have not the nature of &s;atisfaction in them; imperfect works &s;ignify nothing by the Law, to earn eternal Life; the&s;e Men can't claim by the Go&s;pel, becau&s;e they reject Chri&s;t, they can't claim by the Law, becau&s;e they don't keep the Law. <HI>What things the Law faith, it faith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God,</HI> Rom. 3.19.</P>

Conviction of the &s;aving vertue
<PB N="25" REF="001930_0026_0FBA1D504D07FFA0">of the blood of Chri&s;t, is not from common illumination, but from Sanctifying and Sa|ving light: when ever Men are convinced of the &s;aving vertue of Chri&s;ts blood, they will receive him: it is for want of convicti|on and under&s;tanding, that Men do reject Chri&s;t: God gains the Will by convincing the Mind.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is one thing to be convinced of, another to be affected with this dectrine.</HI> Common illuminations are very affecting: Men may be affected with the terrors of hell, yet not certainly believe them; as hypocrites are.

But they that have an intere&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t, make that their plea: that is their great refre&s;hing: Phil. 3.3. <HI>We rejoyce in Chri&s;t Je&s;us and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</HI> When Con&s;cience accu&s;es, they &s;et this again&s;t tho&s;e accu&s;ations. Rom. 8.34. <HI>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chri&s;t that died.</HI> When they think of the Ju&s;tice and Jealou&s;y of God, they remember the dignity of Chri&s;ts Per&s;on. Heb. 1.3. <HI>He who is the ex|pre&s;s image of the Father, has purged our &s;ins by his blood.</HI> They are comforting up them|&s;elves that the <HI>Ju&s;t died for the unjust,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.18. They remember that God has pro|mi&s;ed that Men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.17. When they con&s;ider the provoking nature of Sin, they remember that Chri&s;t has offered a Sacrifice acceptable to God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.2. <HI>They &s;et under his &s;hadow with great delight,</HI> Cant. 2.3. They are beholding the Lamb of God, that takes away the Sin of the world.
<PB N="29" REF="001930_0030_0FBA1D5D11353E30">They likewi&s;e receive &s;trength from Chri&s;t to live holily: the con&s;ideration of the blood of Chri&s;t has a Sanctifying efficacy upon them.

<P><HI>Of Exhortation, to depend on the blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> You want pardon, you are undone, if you be not pardoned. You dare not depend upon your &s;elf, and it is well that you dare not: But you may &s;afely depend upon the blood of Chri&s;t. It is Mens wi&s;dom to be cautious what they do depend upon; it would be a dreadful thing to throw away your Souls: There is no danger in depending upon Chri&s;t. God never propounded any other way to Sin|ners. This is a way agreeable to the Ju&s;tice of God, this is a way contrived by the wi&s;dom of God, this is a proper way to advance the glory of Gods Grace. This is the way that God contrived before the foundation of the World, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20. You need not be afraid of any in&s;ufficiency in the blood of Chri&s;t: Fear to venture you Soul on Chri&s;t, is a re|proaching of God and Chri&s;t; but it is no
<PB N="30" REF="001930_0031_0FBA1D5E8D425538">pre&s;umption to accept Gods offer. It was a &s;afe thing for the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to &s;prinkle the Po&s;ts of the doors with the blood of the pa&s;s|over, when the de&s;troying Angel was to go through the Land of <HI>AEgypt:</HI> It was a &s;afe cour&s;e for them that were &s;tung with the fiery flying Serpents, to look to the brazen Serpent: So, it is a &s;afe thing for you to fall in with the Coun&s;el of God, and tru&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t, <HI>for that clean&s;eth from all &s;ins,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now an&s;wer &s;ome Objections that may ri&s;e in your hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Obj. <HI>It is very uncertain whether I am Elected; and if not, I &s;hall never be &s;aved.</HI> Rom. 11.7. <HI>The Election have obtained it, and the re&s;t are blinded</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The uncertainty of Election is no di&s;couragement. Multitudes of Per&s;ons have come to Chri&s;t and been &s;aved by him, and they were all uncertain of their Election be|fore they came to Chri&s;t: for there is no way to know Election but by Vocation, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. And tho' your Election be uncertain, yet the event of your faith is not uncertain: You u&s;e means for the pre&s;ervation of your Lives, tho' its uncertain whether God have decreed that you &s;hall live any longer. Be|&s;ides, there is an ab&s;olute connexion between Faith &amp; Salvation: if you believe in Chri&s;t that will be a &s;ure &s;ign of Election. 1 The&s;. 1.4, 5. <HI>Knowing brethren your Election of God,
<PB N="31" REF="001930_0032_0FBA1D603805CFE8">for our Go&s;pel came in power,</HI> &amp;c. Faith is a &s;ure fore runner of Salvation. The terms of the Go&s;pel do not run &s;o, If you believe you &s;hall be &s;aved, provided you be Elected; but <HI>he that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life,</HI> Joh. 3.36.</P>
<P N="2">2. Obj. <HI>There are but few that have the be|nefit of the blood of Chri&s;t. Multitudes in Places of Profe&s;&s;ion fall &s;hort of Eternal life.</HI> Math. 20.16. <HI>Many are called and few are cho&s;en.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The rea&s;on why &s;o many fall &s;hort of Salvation is becau&s;e they will not come to Chri&s;t: they refu&s;e and &s;o they peri&s;h, and if you refu&s;e, you will peri&s;h. All that believe in Chri&s;t are &s;aved. Joh. 1.12. <HI>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God.</HI> If you believe in him it will be no &s;trange thing for you to be &s;aved, tho' thou&s;ands fall at your &s;ide, and ten thou&s;and at your right hand: and if there be but few &s;aved, why may not you as well as others obtain? that was no di&s;couragement to <HI>Paul,</HI> or <HI>Peter,</HI> and &s;hould be none to you: you &s;tand as fair as others for Salvation, and will not be rejected if you come.</P>
<P N="3">3. Obj. <HI>I have not the inward Call of the Go&s;pel: all that have that Call are Ju&s;tifyed,</HI> Rom. 8.30. <HI>but I have only the External call, and Multitudes have that, who peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The External call is our warrant to believe. The Go&s;pel is the word of God, and offers of God recorded in the Scripture make it our duty to believe, and are our &s;ecurity in
<PB N="32" REF="001930_0033_0FBA1D619B88CC30">a way of believing. In the External call there is Gods command and Gods promi&s;e, and we mu&s;t be judged by what is written. Rom. 2.16. <HI>God will judge the &s;ecrets of men according to my Go&s;pel.</HI> The inward call is no di&s;tinct call, but only the opening of the eyes to &s;ee the External call to be true. You may not expect any &s;uch revelation as was made to the Prophets. If you believe the Voice of God in his Word, that is enough.</P>
<P N="4">4. Obj. <HI>The blood of Chri&s;t can't move the heart of God to pity me. It &s;eems, that if I had a broken heart, that would move God to pity me; but how can the Sufferings of Chri&s;t move Gods pity to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> You don't need any thing to move God to pity you. The pity of God is only from his own brea&s;t. Ho&s;. 14.4. <HI>I will love them freely.</HI> All that is wanting is, to an&s;|wer the Law for you, to &s;atisfy Ju&s;tice, and pay the price of your Redemption, and this the blood of Chri&s;t has effectually done. It was only the Law that lay in the way of your Salvation, and the blood of Chri&s;t an&s;wers all the challenges of the Law. 1 Pet. 1.19. <HI>We were redeemed with the precious blood of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> His Sufferings were as much as Ju&s;tice doth demand for our Redemption.</P>
<P N="5">5. Obj. <HI>God &s;eems to be too angry with me to accept of me: He must needs be angry with me, becau&s;e I have been provoking of him all my days; and he appears to be &s;o, in that he don't hear my Prayers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="001930_0034_0FBA1D6552525A78">
<HI>An&s;.</HI> God is alwayes angry with Men un|til he pardons them: till the very moment wherein they are pardoned, his anger is not abated But he is never &s;o angry with any Man, but he &s;tands ready to pardon him, if he comes to Ghri&s;t. Acts 10.43. <HI>To him give all the Prophets witne&s;s, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> The an|ger of God is no pa&s;&s;ion, his anger is the an|ger of a Judge, He is angry becau&s;e Men are guilty of the Law; but when they come to Chri&s;t, they are not guilty by the Law, the Law acquits them, and &s;o Gods anger cea&s;es. God is never &s;o angry as to be unfaithful; if he be angry, he will not forget his Word.</P>
<P N="6">6. Obj. <HI>I am not godly but under the power of Sin, and &s;o it &s;eems to be a pre&s;umptuous thing for me to thrust my &s;elf on Chri&s;t: for without holi|ne&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee God,</HI> Heb 12.14.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God doth not expect, that Men &s;hould be fir&s;t holy, and &s;o be encouraged to come to Chri&s;t; they are invited that have no holi|ne&s;s, they that are wretched and blind and naked, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18. They that are a thir&s;t, being de&s;titute of Grace are invited, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.17. There is no need of antecedent holine&s;s, before Men come to Chri&s;t, though there is al|wayes a concomitant holine&s;s: Men come with a &s;pirit of Love and Repentance.

<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>Natural Men are under the government of Self-Love.</Q>
<P>Godly Men are under the influence of a better and higher principle, they have a &s;pi|rit of love to God. P&s;al. 18.1. <HI>I love thee, O Lord, my &s;trength.</HI> But Natural Men are ruled by a &s;pirit of &s;elf-love. The fir&s;t and great Command is, <HI>to love the Lord thy God with all the heart,</HI> Matth. 22.37, 38. But Na|tural Men are wholly de&s;titute of this &s;pirit.
<PB N="36" REF="001930_0037_0FBA1D6E515ACF60">There is much of a &s;pirit of &s;elf-love in the Saints; but other Men are under the power of it. Phil. 2.21. <HI>All &s;eek their own things, and not the things of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Self-love branches out it &s;elf into the love of honour, and profit, and ea&s;e, and carnal plea&s;ure, of their wills, and of their lives; and &s;ome|times the love of one intere&s;t is predominant, and &s;ometimes the love of another, but &s;till they are governed by a &s;pirit of &s;elf-love. Their own hearts tell them, that they &s;hould not be governed by it, but it doth rule them.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this I &s;hall fir&s;t premi&s;e two Cautions, and then prove the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Caution, 1. <HI>They are &s;ometimes over-ruled by a &s;pirit of Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Men that are devo|ted to them&s;elves, are &s;o over-born &s;ometimes with a Spirit of Compa&s;&s;ion, that they forget their own Intere&s;t. Some Men are more com|pa&s;&s;ionate than others: but there is no Man &s;o void of compa&s;&s;ion, but upon &s;ome occa&s;ions pity will prevail upon him. The &s;eeing or hearing of the Mi&s;eries of others, will extort acts of compa&s;&s;ion, and they will be under a nece&s;&s;ity to deny them&s;elves, and relieve them. Men have not the command of their own compa&s;&s;ions, their compa&s;&s;ion doth pre|vail &s;ometimes whether they will or no, and they are forced to neglect their own intere&s;t to relieve others in their di&s;tre&s;s: and this compa&s;&s;ion is not only to friends, but to &s;trangers, per&s;ons that they have no acquain|tance with; yea to Enemies, per&s;ons that
<PB N="37" REF="001930_0038_0FBA1D6FEA999038">they are prone to do a di&s;plea&s;ure to them; yea, to bruit Creatures al&s;o.</P>
<P>Caution, 2. <HI>Sometimes they are over-ruled by Con&s;cience of Good and Evil.</HI> Some things are &s;o manife&s;tly good, that they cannot but give an approbation to them, and &s;ome are &s;o ma|nife&s;tly evil, that Men mu&s;t di&s;approve them. Rom. 2.18. <HI>Thou approve&s;t the things that are excellent being in&s;tructed out of the Law.</HI> Con|&s;cience will bear its te&s;timony for &s;ome things and again&s;t others, though it thwarts their own intere&s;t. Some things appear &s;o right, that they will plead for them, though it be again&s;t their own intere&s;t: And &s;ome appear &s;o wrong, that they will plead again&s;t them. Sometimes carnal Men will &s;tand up in a cau&s;e from the meer dictates of Con&s;cience, though he doth expo&s;e him&s;elf to great cala|mities thereby, it would apparently be his intere&s;t to be on the other &s;ide, but Con&s;cience bears down all before it. The Con&s;ciences of bears down all before it. The Con&s;ciences of Men are very much corrupted, and &s;ome|times they will offer violence to them, for a little gain or plea&s;ure, or to obtain favour with Men: but &s;ometimes it is otherwi&s;e, Con&s;cience will overcome regard to their Re|putation, and regard to their worldly profit, and in obedience to the dictates of Con&s;cience they will forget their intere&s;t: they are &s;et that right &s;hould take place, tho' they &s;uffer for what they do.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e things, I &s;hall now prove the Doctrine. And it appears by an induction of particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="38" REF="001930_0039_0FBA1D750EB19CA8">
1. <HI>They are governed by &s;elf-love in their ill Affection to God.</HI> It is &s;aid of carnal Men that <HI>they have God:</HI> Joh. 15.25. <HI>They hated me without a cau&s;e.</HI> Rom. 1.30. <HI>They are ha|ters of God.</HI> Rom. 8.7. <HI>The natural mind is Enmity to God.</HI> Some of the&s;e Men find af|fections to God, yet they are enemies to him: <HI>They were alienated and enemies to God by wick|ed works,</HI> Col. 1.21. They are wholly de&s;ti|tute of love to God: Joh. 5.42. <HI>You have not the love of God in you.</HI> They could be glad there were no God. They don't like it that he &s;ees them, that he is ju&s;t, that he is able to avenge him&s;elf. And the foundation of this enmity to God is &s;elf-love. They are &s;o addicted to their own intere&s;t as makes them to have a bitter &s;pirit towards God.</P>
<P>They hate God becau&s;e he cro&s;&s;es them in his Laws. They have a de&s;ire to &s;erve their corruptions, but they are re&s;trained by God: they would fain have more liberty in follow|ing their plea&s;ures, than the Laws of God do allow them: &s;o in pur&s;uing the World, but God will not &s;uffer them They dare not do what they have a mind to do, lea&s;t God &s;hould be offended. Carnal Men affect a great deal of liberty, they would walk after the &s;ight of their eyes, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 11.9. but God limits them and controuls them, he tells, that they may not do this and this, and they are forced to deny them&s;elves of many things that they de&s;ire, and they don't know how to bear it. It &s;eems to them that God is an enemy to
<PB N="39" REF="001930_0040_0FBA1D7759B72528">their comfort; they think they could live an happy life, if they were not confined within &s;uch narrow bounds, and &s;o they have an ill affection unto God as an adver&s;ary of their felicity.</P>
<P>So they hate God becau&s;e he afflicts them in his Providence. They have a great many afflictions that are very cro&s;s to them, &s;ome|times they are afflicted with Sickne&s;s &amp; Death in their Families; &s;ometimes their Corn is bla&s;ted, the Worms devour their fruit, Ene|mies di&s;tre&s;s them, their de&s;igns are broken, their joy is turned into &s;orrow, they are in|volved in difficulties, and they attribute the&s;e things to God. Whatever be the in&s;trument of the affliction, yet it comes from God; if it &s;eems to be a meer ca&s;ualty, yet it is ordered by God. Job 12.9. <HI>Who knoweth not in all the&s;e, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</HI> They think it is God that bereaves them, and makes them poor, he could ea&s;ily have pre|vented their &s;orrows, but he has a mind to cro&s;s them, &s;o they look upon him, as an ene|my to their comfort; he is ever and anon plaguing them, and wont &s;uffer them to live quietly, and they are very angry with him. Jon. 4.1. <HI>It di&s;plea&s;ed Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry.</HI> I&s;ai. 8.21. <HI>When they &s;hall be hungry, they &s;hall fret them&s;elves and cur&s;e their King and their God.</HI></P>
<P>So they hate God becau&s;e they are afraid that he will bring mi&s;eries upon them. If they pro&s;per at pre&s;ent, they are afraid that
<PB N="40" REF="001930_0041_0FBA1D7A005553C0">God will go out again&s;t them in ways of di&s;|plea&s;ure. They know, that they are guilty, and they have a terrour upon their &s;pirits, lea&s;t wrath will fall upon them. Job 15.21. <HI>A dreadful &s;ound is in his ears.</HI> They think they &s;hould do well enough if God would but let them alone; but they are afraid that God will damn them. They read many threat|nings in the Scriptures again&s;t Unconverted Men, and they are doubtful that God has determined to de&s;troy them, and they don't know how to bear the thoughts of it. The fear of Hell &s;poils their Mirth, and it is a ter|rible provocation to them: they are even rea|dy to bla&s;pheme God Rev. 16.11. <HI>They bla&s;|phemed the God of Heaven, becau&s;e of their plagues, and becau&s;e of their &s;ores.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are governed by &s;elf-love in their ill Affection to Men.</HI> Men are obliged <HI>to love their Neighbours as them&s;elves,</HI> Matth. 22.39. But no natural Men do in any mea&s;ure live up to this rule; but Men are great enemies one to another. Tit. 3.3. <HI>Hateful and hating one another;</HI> they do but a little good one to another: they do a great deal of hurt one to another, abundance of the mi&s;eries of Men ri&s;e from Men; Men do much more hurt one to another, than the bruit Creatures do to them. They are like pricks in one anothers eyes, and like thorns in their &s;ides. And the foun|dation of this is inordinate &s;elf love; their love to them&s;elves begets enmity to others. 2 Tim 3.2, 3. <HI>Men &s;hall be lovers of them&s;elves,
<PB N="41" REF="001930_0042_0FBA1D7CCCC201A8">di&s;obedient to Parents, unthankful, without natu|ral affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, de&s;|pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sometimes they hate other Men becau&s;e they hurt them. Self-love makes Men tender of their intere&s;t, and if other Men hurt their E&s;tates, their Reputation, their Bodies, their Children, their Spirits are imbittered again&s;t them, they &s;tand ready to revenge their wrongs; they can't bear it, that their intere&s;t is touched; if they have an opportunity they will be even with them, their hearts are me|ditating revenge. <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> will re|venge the wrong done to their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>Joab</HI> will avenge him&s;elf of <HI>Abner</HI> for the death of <HI>A&s;ahel,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 3.27. Yea, if they but &s;up|po&s;e they have hurt them, they will be en|raged, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.19.</P>
<P>Sometimes they are afraid others will hurt them, and that makes them hate them: others have threatned them, have made attempts that way; &s;ometimes they have provobed others, and they expect the fruit of their di&s;plea&s;ure, and upon that account they &s;eek their hurt. <HI>Hanun</HI> had given occa&s;ion of anger to <HI>Lavid,</HI> and then prepares to make War with him, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.6. If they are but jealous, that another will do them a di&s;plea&s;ure, they have an evil eye towards him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.9. Self|love makes them to have an ill affection to|wards others becau&s;e they &s;tand in their way. Men are in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome advantage, and &s;ome others &s;tand in their way, they are
<PB N="42" REF="001930_0043_0FBA1D7E031BBB08">competitours? with them for the &s;ame O&s;hice, others are as well accompli&s;hed as them&s;elves, and they have an intere&s;t in the heart of tho&s;e that have power to preferthem, and &s;o them|&s;elves are in danger of di&s;appointment, and they can't bear them, they will tell of their infirmities, and &s;eek their ruine. <HI>Abner</HI> can't bear <HI>Ama&s;a's</HI> advancement, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.10.</P>
<P>Sometimes they have an ill affection to o|thers becau&s;e they do out-&s;trip them; &s;ome|times others carry more worthily and honou|rably than them&s;elves, and they can't bear them. Eccl. 4.4. <HI>For every good and every right work, a man is envied of his Neighbour.</HI> Some have more knowledge and greater ability, and they can't love them. They would be glad to engro&s;s every thing that is commen|dable. Men are hated becau&s;e of their en|joyments &amp; attainments. <HI>Rachel</HI> envied her Si&s;ter, <HI>Corah</HI> envied <HI>Aaron, Saul</HI> envied <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>Self-love makes Men have an ill affection to others, becau&s;e they blame them. Some Men are much offended, when they are reproved, they are fonder of their reputation, and take a reproof for an affront: they take it to be a great abu&s;e, and bear a grudge on that at|count, &s;tand ready to revenge them&s;elves, and are forward to do a Man a di&s;plea&s;ure on that account. So the Phari&s;ees hated Chri&s;t. So <HI>Abner</HI> hated <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.8. Men love to have others Prophecy &s;mooth things, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 30.10.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Self-love governs in Moral Carriages.</HI> Some Natural Men have their particular Mo|ral vertures: &s;ome Men are of Truth, &s;ome are very ju&s;t, &s;ome are temperare, &s;ome are dutiful to Superiours: Some are adorned with all moral vertues, they have a lovely conver&s;ation, and are much to be commended on the account of their Morality. Matth. 19.20. <HI>All tho&s;e things have I done from my youth.</HI> But they are go|verned therein by a &s;pirit of &s;elf love. Self|love will make Men carry very badly, and &s;elf-love will make Men carry very well. This is the wound of their Morality, that they don't &s;erve God therein, but they &s;erve them|&s;elves. Ho&s;. 10.1. <HI>Ephrains is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto him&s;elf;</HI> they have a &s;elvi&s;h aim in all they do. It is lawful for them to aim at them&s;elves in a &s;ubordinate way, to the glory of God: but they make them&s;elves their la&s;t end.</P>
<P>Sometimes they do it for their Reputation. Vicious carriages are &s;hameful; if they be known they are a di&s;grace to them. Gen 38.23 <HI>Let her take it to her &s;elf lea&s;t we be &s;hamed.</HI> Such carriages are matter of reproach, thereby they make them&s;elves of the number of the fools in I&s;rael; they are de&s;pi&s;ed and render them&s;elves ignominious; their Relations are a&s;hamed of them: it is a di&s;grace to be fami|liar with them. This con&s;ideration is the great thing that influences many Men: they
<PB N="44" REF="001930_0045_0FBA1D8409796A40">can't endure to be objects of contempt and &s;corn; they think of that Scripture, Prov. 6.33. <HI>A wound and di&s;honour &s;hall he get and his re|proach &s;hall not be wiped away.</HI> They hate to be a by-word. This makes them to with&s;tand temptation, they are content to deny them|&s;elves of their plea&s;ures that they might keep a good Name.</P>
<P>Sometimes they carry morally for their profit. Many corrupt carriages are of im|poveri&s;hing Nature; &s;o is Idlene&s;s. Prov. 6.10, 11. <HI>Yet a little &s;leep, a little &s;lumber, a little folding of the hands to &s;leep, &s;o &s;hall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</HI> So is Wontonne&s;s, Prov. 5.10. <HI>Lea&s;t strangers be filled with thy wealth.</HI> So is Intemperance, Prov. 23.21. <HI>The Drunkard and the Glutton &s;hall come to poverty.</HI> Men that are given to that, lavi&s;h away their E&s;tates. And Men ab&s;tain from Vice, becau&s;e they can't endure to be brought to &s;traits and nece&s;&s;ities, they are backward to &s;uch ways as will draw them into Expences; it &s;eems to them a fooli&s;h thing to wa&s;te what they have, they &s;hould bring them&s;elves to Poverty, they can hardly afford to &s;pend for nece&s;&s;ity, much le&s;s for &s;u|perfluity. They conform to many Moral Rules from principles of good Husbandry.</P>
<P>Sometimes they carry Morally to plea&s;e their Friends. Some Per&s;ons are &s;o hardned in &s;in that they don't much regard their Relations. They are like <HI>Eli's</HI> Sons <HI>that did not hearken to the Voice of their Father:</HI> but there be &s;ome
<PB N="45" REF="001930_0046_0FBA1D864EA55038">that have a great Veneration for their Parents, they are &s;en&s;ible that their Parents have a dear affection to them, and they count them wi&s;e and good, &amp; can't bear to grieve them, and their coun&s;els &s;tick upon their hearts. When they have Temptations they think if they &s;hould comply it would be bitter to their Parents, and &s;o they reject Temptation; and they dare not be &s;o bad as others. 2 Chron. 24.2. <HI>Joa&s;h did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord, all the days of Jehoiadah the Priest.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes it is to prevent the Reproach of their Con&s;ciences. They have experience that when they carry orderly, they have not &s;uch Reflections as at other times, their hearts don't twit them, nor revile them. They are more quiet within and can vindicate them|&s;elves, but if at any time they are extravagant, it perplexes them afterward, &amp; they have a &s;torm within; their Con&s;ciences upbraid them, and imbitter their comforts, their car|riages look ugly and ba&s;e, <HI>Judg.</HI> 17.2. And &s;o they re&s;i&s;t Temptation.</P>
<P>So they carry Morally to prevent Judgment. The Scripture is full of In&s;tances of Judg|ment on particular Per&s;ons for &s;inful carria|ges, and they dare not fall in with Temptati|on lea&s;t the wrath of God &s;hould break out again&s;t them, and lea&s;t they &s;hould peri&s;h for ever. Job 31.23. <HI>De&s;truction from God was a terrour unto me.</HI></P>

4. <HI>Self love governs them in their Religion.</HI> Natural Men do perform many duties of Re|ligion.

<P>Some of them have wicked ends in their Wor&s;hip. They have &s;ome ba&s;e de&s;igns when they carry Religiou&s;ly. Mat. 23.14. <HI>They de|vour widows hou&s;es and for a pretence make long Prayers.</HI> They have been Religious that they might avoid duty to their Parents, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.5, 6.

<P><PB N="47" REF="001930_0048_0FBA1DEC4132FDD8">
This is very evident in &s;ome, becau&s;e they ca&s;t off Religion when it is not for their In|tere&s;t. If Men aimed at Gods glory, they would pur&s;ue it to the end of their days: no flatteries would make them ca&s;t it off; no danger would make them relinqui&s;h their Re|ligion: but &s;ome of them after a while are turn coats, they &s;ee an opportunity to mend their E&s;tates, and &s;hake off Religion. <HI>Demas has for&s;aken me having loved this pre&s;ent world,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.10.

<P>Some Men aim at no more Religion than will promote their own Intere&s;t; they love to get &s;o much as will make them acceptable to Men, and don't regard to get more: and &s;ome would fain have &s;o much as will &s;ecure their Salvation, that they may have Eternal Life, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.16. but think it &s;uperflu|ous to afflict them&s;elves to get any further mea&s;ures of Religion.

Some are very de&s;irous to Enjoy God when they die: it is a horrour to them to go to Hell: but they don't regard Gods Pre&s;ence here: they can live contentedly without Communion with God here. But godly Men prefer his Pre&s;ence here. P&s;al. 63.1, 2. <HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth for thee.</HI> Such Men as prefer the enjoyment of God, wont neglect any thing that is need|ful in order to the enjoyment of God. They wont think much of their Time, and their Pains; they will put away their Sins; they will part with any thing rather than loo&s;e God: they will part with E&s;tate, and Ea&s;e, and Liberty, and Life, rather than loo&s;e God. Acts 21.13. <HI>I am ready to die for the Name of Je&s;us.</HI> Rev. 12.11. <HI>They loved not their lives unto the death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Que&s;t. <HI>Do you prefer the Honour of God before any worldly Enjoyment?</HI> The honour of God is of more Moment than your Outward Enjoyments. And it is fit God &s;hould have his honour whatever doth become of your Enjoyments; but many will not &s;tir much out of their way for the honour of God. But tho&s;e Men that pur&s;ue the honour of God, will not live in any Sin for the &s;ake of any worldly Enjoyment. All Sin is to Gods di&s;|honour, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.23. If you e&s;teemed the ho|nour of God above your Enjoyments, you would not endure to live in any Sin for the
<PB N="58" REF="001930_0059_0FBA1E0F8115AA08">&s;ake of them. A Man that prefers the honour of God, will be contented that God &s;hould vindicate his Name by Judgments. Some Men can't bear Judgments, the rea&s;on is they don't care what becomes of Gods honour, &s;o they can &s;houri&s;h in the World. If Men pre|fer the honour of God, they think it is well that God brings Judgments: though they &s;uffer by them, yet they are willing it &s;hould be &s;o. They &s;ay, there is need of them for the vindication of the Name of God. Dan. 9.7. <HI>O Lord, Righteou&s;ne&s;s belongeth unto thee, but unto us confu&s;ion of face.</HI> If you prefer the honour of God, you will part with any en|joyment for Gods honour. Some think much to part with any thing for Gods honour: But <HI>Abraham</HI> parted with his Country, with the Goods that he had taken in Battle, and with his Son for Gods honour.</P>
<P N="3">3. Que&s;t. <HI>Do you prefer the honour of God before your Salvation?</HI> The honour of God is of more worth than your Salvation, and you mu&s;t prefer the honour of God before it. It is not a duty to be willing to be damned for Gods honour. It is fit the Will of Man &s;hould &s;ubmit to the plea&s;ure of God, how|over he will di&s;po&s;e of them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.21. But he don't require Men to be freely willing to be damned, or to choo&s;e damnation for his honour; for God requires Men to &s;eek Salva|tion, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.33. And indeed it is again&s;t Religion to be willing to be damned, for then they will be everla&s;ting enemies to God.
<PB N="59" REF="001930_0060_0FBA1E13C88B9F40">Love to Gods glory will make Men to be un|willing to be the in&s;truments of his di&s;ho|nour. Yea, it is impo&s;&s;ible that Men &s;hould be under&s;tandingly willing to be damned; for it is again&s;t Nature: there is no principle in Man to make him willing. Yet tho&s;e that love God prefer his glory before their Salva|tion: they are &s;atisfyed in the Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of God in damning Men for his ho|nour; they de&s;ire Salvation principally that they may honour God. They do count the honour of God of greater moment than their Salvation, and take a complacency in that, that God will not di&s;honour him&s;elf, but will glo|rify his Name. Jude 25. <HI>To the only wi&s;e God our Saviour, be glory, and maje&s;ty, and dominion, and power, both now and ever, Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Of Conviction, Of the wretchedne&s;s of Natural Men.</HI> There is a con&s;iderable difference be|tween them, as to their outward Conver&s;a|tion. Some of them are rude and prophane, and do openly trample on the Authority of God.

When we read the dreadful threatning that God has denounced again&s;t them, we &s;hall not need to wonder: there is no occa&s;ion to think that God deals hardly with them: for they utterly neglect the end that they were made for, and make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve

Many &s;evere Laws are made in one Kingdom and another to prevent the&s;e Sins, but they break in like a flood, and &s;pread over the World: and this is the cau&s;e of them, Men love them&s;elves more than God. One loves his plea&s;ures more than God, another his profit or his honour; one Mans Self-love works in one channel, anothers in another; this is the root of all wickedne&s;s: the Spirit of every Natural Man has in it the Seed of all wickedne&s;s: In &s;ome it grows up to more maturity than in others; but they are of &s;uch a Spirit as would lead them into every abo|mination. 2 Tim. 3.2, 3. <HI>Men &s;hall be lo|vers of them&s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to Parents,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>GOD created the World without any in|&s;trument, but in Conver&s;ion he make u&s;e of the Go&s;pel as his in&s;trument. The Go&s;pel is but an in&s;trument, for many that enjoy the Go&s;pel never are Converted: but the Go&s;pel is the in&s;trument in this work; the Go&s;pel is not a Phy&s;ical in&s;trument, but it is a Mo|ral in&s;trument of Conver&s;ion. There is no expectation that Men &s;hould be Converted
<PB N="67" REF="001930_0068_0FBA1E2A8371A720">that do not enjoy the Go&s;pel; there may be Reformation without the Go&s;pel, but not Conver&s;ion, for the Go&s;pel is the in&s;trument of Conver&s;ion. The Go&s;pel is not the Means only to bring Nations to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the faith, but al&s;o to bring Men into a &s;tate of Grace. Conver&s;ion prepares Men for pardon of Sin, and heavenly Glory, and the Go&s;pel is the in&s;trument of this work. The Go&s;pel is very &s;erviceable to Men after they are Con|verted: it is very u&s;eful for the increa&s;e of Grace and Con&s;olation; but it is al&s;o the in|&s;trument of Conver&s;ion.

The&s;e works &s;hew that Sin is rebellion again&s;t the Author of their lives; that it is unrea&s;onable to neglect him. Dan. 5.23. <HI>The God in who&s;e hand thy breath is, and who&s;e are all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.</HI> And that God mu&s;t take Sin very heinou&s;ly. I&s;ai. 1.2. <HI>I have nouri&s;hed and brought up Children and they have rebelled against me.</HI> The&s;e works are a Conviction that God is able to avenge him&s;elf on Man for their rebellion; that there is no defence again&s;t the mighty power of God: that he is able to perform all his threat|nings and his promi&s;es.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Law or Covenant of Works, is a Means to prepare Men.</HI> The Covenant of Works con&s;i&s;ts of Precepts and Sanctions, and is very &s;erviceable to promote Mens Conver&s;ion.

<PB N="69" REF="001930_0070_0FBA1E3082708AD0">Actions with the Commands they are con|vinced of their iniquity. Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the Law is the knowledge of &s;in.</HI> Heb 4.12. <HI>The word of God is quick and powerful, &s;harper than any two edged &s;word, piercing even to the divi|ding a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, of the joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</HI> The Law has al&s;o an ex|a&s;perating power, is an occa&s;ion of the work|ings of Corruption, as the dam makes the warers &s;well; and &s;o Men become acquain|ted with their own hearts. Rom. 7.3 <HI>Sin taking occa&s;ion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of concupi&s;cence.</HI> The Law al&s;o condemns Men for Sin, &s;hews them their mi|&s;ery, what de&s;truction they are in danger of, terrifies the Con&s;cience: the Law &s;ays, <HI>The wages of &s;in is death,</HI> Rom. 6.23.

Math. 5.18. <HI>No jot or title &s;hall pa&s;s from the law but all mu&s;t be fullfilled.</HI> The Law doth al&s;o di&s;cover the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Mans condemnation: Rom. 3.19. <HI>What things the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the World become guilty before God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Works of Providence do al&s;o prepare Men for Conver&s;ion.</HI> Gods works of Provi|dence are various, and contribute much to|wards Mens Conver&s;ion. Mercies are a Means to draw Men to &s;eek the favour of God, and Afflictions are Means to awaken Mens Con&s;ciences. Sometimes Men have par|ticular
<PB N="70" REF="001930_0071_0FBA1E368672D548">Afflictions, and they are very &s;ervi|ceable. Job 33.22, 3, 4. <HI>His &s;oul draws near to the grave, and his life to the de&s;troyers; if there be a me&s;&s;enger with him, an interpreter, one among a thou&s;and, to &s;hew to man his upright|ne&s;s; then he is gracious to him, and &s;aith, deli|ver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ran&s;om.</HI> So, Job 36.8, 9, 10. <HI>If they be bound in fetters, and held in cords of affliction, then he &s;heweth them their work and their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions that they have exceeded; he openeth al|&s;o their ear to di&s;cipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh.</HI> Sometimes Publick Judgments are very &s;erviceable to them. Ho&s;. 5.15. <HI>I will go and return to my place, till they acknow|ledge their offence and &s;eek my face: in their af|fliction they will &s;eek me early.</HI> Some Per&s;ons are &s;mitten in Con&s;cience at &s;uch times, and &s;tirred up to be &s;eeking Peace with God. So the great Works of God in the World are u&s;e|ful to this end. Storms and Thunder and Lightning and Earthquakes. 1 Sam. 12.18, 19. <HI>The Lord &s;ent Thunder and Rain that day, and all the People greatly feared the Lord and Sa|muel; and all the People &s;aid unto Samuel, Pray for thy &s;ervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider, 2. <HI>That if God would open the eyes of Men to &s;ee his Glory in the works of Creation, or in the Law, or in Providences, that would make Men holy.</HI> There is a great deal of con|vincing light in the&s;e things, and they
<PB N="71" REF="001930_0072_0FBA1E3854316348">di&s;cover the glory of God. P&s;al. 8.1. <HI>O Lord Our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth?</HI> And if there were but inward di&s;|coveries made to the Heathens thereby, they would love and fear God. There is abun|dant cau&s;e to love God from the di&s;coveries of his glory in the&s;e; the power of God, and wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God manife&s;ted in the works of Creation, are lovely: and the holine&s;s wi&s;dom of God appearing in his Law, are lovely: and the glorious Proper|ties of God appearing in the works of Provi|dence, are lovely; and give &s;ufficient cau&s;e to Men to love and &s;erve God: and upon this account it is that the Heathens are guilty for their not loving &amp; &s;erving God; this makes them without Excu&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20. They have Conviction enough &s;et before them to draw their hearts to God.</P>

<P>4 Con&s;ider, <HI>Why God doth this by the Go&s;pel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ao&s;.</HI> Here take notice of the&s;e four parti|culars,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t is the condition of Pardon and Salvation.</HI> Perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s was the condition of the Covenant of Works Gal, 3.12. <HI>He that doth them &s;hall live in them.</HI> Perfect Obedience fell under a double con&s;i|deration in the Covenant of Works: it was the matter of Ju&s;tification, and &s;o it is &s;till, for we are now Ju&s;tifyed by the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. Therefore he is &s;aid <HI>to bring in ever lasting Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Dan. 9.24. <HI>And by
<PB N="77" REF="001930_0078_0FBA1E4E31A83820">the Obedience of One &s;hall many be made Righ|teous,</HI> Rom. 5.13. And perfect Obedience was al&s;o the condition of Ju&s;tification. But now under the Go&s;pel Faith is the condition of Ju&s;tification. Joh. 5.24. <HI>He that heareth my words and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everlasting life, and &s;hall not enter into condem|nation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from death to life.</HI> It is by Faith that we are accepted: The terms of Ju&s;tification are, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us and thou &s;halt be &s;aved,</HI> Act. 15.31. It is Faith that gives a Man an intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is mo&s;t &s;uitable that among the Graces of the Spirit Faith only &s;hould be the condition of Ju&s;tification. Love to God is as holy an action as Faith: Yet it is mo&s;t &s;uitable that Faith &s;hould be the condition, becau&s;e it doth accept of the Grace of God offered in the Go&s;pel, and is an acknowledgement of the &s;ufficiency of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and God has made it to be the condition of our Ju&s;tifica|tion. Act 10.43. <HI>To him give all the Pro|phets witne&s;s that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive the remi&s;&s;on of &s;ins.</HI> Hence Faith is called our Evangelical Righteou&s;ne&s;s: it is called <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith,</HI> Heb. 11.7. God has made a law concerning our Ju&s;tifi|cation, which is called <HI>the Law of Faith,</HI> Rom. 3.27. And when we believe we have ful|filled the condition of the Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Therefore it is meet that Faith &s;hould be first wrought.</HI> The fir&s;t good thing that is wrought in any Man is Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<PB N="78" REF="001930_0079_0FBA1E50D620F290">this being the condition of Ju&s;tification, it is no ways fit that Men &s;hould have other good things wrought in them before Faith: for it is not fit that Love and Repentance &s;hould be wrought in him, and yet he remain in an E&s;tate of condemnation. Every Man is in an E&s;tate of condemnation until he believes in Chri&s;t. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already,</HI> Joh. 3.18. And it is altogether un|&s;uitable that a Man &s;hould have the Exerci&s;e of Love and Repentance given to him, and yet be &s;uffered to lie in an E&s;tate of condem|nation. But if they were wrought before Faith, then the Man would have a gracious Spirit, and be Sanctifyed, yet remain a Child of wrath and be under the cur&s;e of God, and in a peri&s;hing condition, then Love and Re|pentance would be no &s;igns of Ju&s;tification, and the&s;e Sins which were mortifyed would be imputed, but this would be utterly un&s;ui|table: but &s;eeing Faith is the condition of Reconciliation, it is meet that Faith &s;hould be the fir&s;t good thing that is wrought in the Man. And &s;o it is, God never gives Men Love or Repentance before Faith; whatever appearances there may be of tho&s;e things, all is in hypocri&s;y that goes before Faith; there is no godly Sorrow, no regard to the glory of God, until Men believe in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This Faith in Chri&s;t can be wrought only by the Go&s;pel.</HI> Faith in Chri&s;t is an accepting the offer of the Go&s;pel: Faith is an acknow|ledgment of the Grace of God held forth in
<PB N="79" REF="001930_0080_0FBA1E5242D8CA50">the Go&s;pel, and of the faithfulne&s;s of God in Go&s;pel-promi&s;es, and of the Righteou&s;ue&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; Faith is a coming to Chri&s;t as a Mighty Saviour, and it is impo&s;&s;ible for Men to come to Chri&s;t and know nothing of him. Rom. 10.14. <HI>How can they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</HI> Can a Man admire the excellency of Chri&s;t, and take en|couragement from him, and venture his Soul on him, and yet know nothing of him? Can a Man that is an utter &s;tranger to Je&s;us Chri&s;t glory in him, and prefer his Righteou&s;ne&s;s before all his own works, and build the hopes of his Soul for another World upon him, as a &s;ure foundation, before he is made acquain|ted with the &s;u&s;liciency of Chri&s;t? Let a Man know never &s;o much of the works of Creation, of the Mighty Power of God in making all things out of nothing: and of the Wi&s;dom of God in making &s;uch variety of Creatures, in divers Forms, with great di|ver&s;ity of faculties and vertues; in giving &s;uch perfection to the World, that there is nothing wanting to the integrity of it, this will never prevail upon him to depend upon an unknown Chri&s;t. If a Man be terribly frighted with his Sins and under the awful apprehen&s;ions of the wrath of God, &s;o that his fle&s;h and his heart trembles, that will not prevail upon him to come to an unknown Chri&s;t. Let Men be never &s;o much affected with Mercies or Afflictions, yet he will neg|lect. If he don't know him, there can be
<PB N="80" REF="001930_0081_0FBA1E5548F3F630">no act of Faith without the knowledge of the object of Faith, there can be no act of Faith without the knowledge of the incou|ragements to believe. Faith is a rational under&s;tanding action: In order to the act of faith, there mu&s;t be a knowledge of the Go&s;pel, and the actual con&s;ideration of it, at the very time.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Go&s;pel is not only proper to work Faith, but al&s;o to work every other Grace.</HI> The Go&s;|pel doth not only work the heart to believe, but it draws the heart to other gracious Ex|erci&s;es; when Men &s;ee the love of God in the Go&s;pel, that draws forth love. 1 Joh. 4.19. <HI>We love him, becau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t.</HI> The knowledge of the Go&s;pel makes Men fear God. P&s;al. 130.4. <HI>There is forgivene&s;s with thee, that thou may&s;t be feared.</HI> The Go&s;pel is a proper Means to work a Spirit of Repen|tance, and break the heart for Sin. Luk. 7.38. <HI>She stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wa&s;h his feet with tears.</HI> This was the fruit of her receiving the Go&s;pel, for her &s;ins were forgiven, <HI>v.</HI> 47. By the Go&s;|pel Mens hearts are brought into a prepared|ne&s;s for all holy carriages; the Go&s;pel is an effectual Means not only to draw Men to Chri&s;t, but to work univer&s;al holine&s;s. Tit. 2.11, 12. <HI>The Grace of God that bringeth &s;al|vation, teacheth us to deny ungodline&s;s and world|ly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and god|ly in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> This makes Men New Creatures. <HI>If any man be in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,

<PB N="82" REF="001930_0083_0FBA2177CAC30910">Moral vertues may be lo&s;t. A Man that is ju&s;t and temperate, and a Man of Truth, may de&s;erve a contrary character before he goes out of the World.

And if a Man begins to rejoyce in the apprehen&s;ion of his Conver&s;ion, he is pre&s;ently ca&s;t down with fears, whether he be not mi&s;taken: He reads the promi&s;es that are made to Converted Men, and they are &s;weet and precious to him, he would fain take the comfort of them, but he &s;tands quivering, but dare not apply them to him&s;elf. He thinks of tho&s;e words, <HI>If a man thinks him&s;elf &s;omething when he is nothing, he deceiveth him&s;elf.</HI> And when he reads threat|nings to Unconverted Men, he has an awful &s;ence of the doleful condition of &s;uch Men, and he pities them with all his heart; he can't conceive how they will do to bear tho&s;e mi|&s;eries; he thinks their worldly &s;elicities will be utterly forgotten after a while, and they will mourn at the la&s;t: but then it turns in his thoughts, that may be he is one of them, and he is frighted lea&s;t they &s;hould be execu|ted upon him; he &s;ays, that has been the portion of many Men, that have promi&s;ed great things to them&s;elves; many Mens hopes do utterly fail, when God takes away their Souls, and he &s;ays, if that &s;hould be his por|tion he &s;hould be undone. When his Neigh|bours know nothing of it, he is in angui&s;h of Spirit, becau&s;e he is in &s;u&s;pence, whether he &s;hall hear tho&s;e words, <HI>Come you ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> or, <HI>Go you cur&s;ed.</HI> Some will be ble&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome will be cur&s;ed, but he doth not know which number he doth belong unto. There|fore examine your &s;elves; this doctrine gives
<PB N="87" REF="001930_0088_0FBA2182A13484D0">light into it: The Go&s;pel is the in&s;trument of Conver&s;ion, no body el&s;e can tell, how they were Converted; but if it were true Conver|&s;ion, it was by the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It may be wrought by Go&s;pel promi&s;es.</HI> There be many great and precious promi&s;es. Joh 6.37. <HI>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Math. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> Rev. 3.20. <HI>If any man open unto me, I will come in and &s;up with him and he with me.</HI> The&s;e promi&s;es are a great &s;ecurity to all that come to Chri&s;t, they give an a&s;&s;urance that Men &s;hall be accepted. The faithfulne&s;s of God &s;tands engaged for their Salvation. A Man may Pray, &amp; Read, &amp; Confe&s;s Sin, &amp; Fa&s;t, yet have no &s;ecurity for his Salvation; but if he receives Chri&s;t, God has pa&s;&s;ed his word, and that is the be&s;t &s;ecurity in the World for his Salvation. He has left him&s;elf at li|berty whether he will give Health, or Riches, or Honour, but he has promi&s;ed Eternal Life. And if in the&s;e promi&s;es, or any &s;uch like. God has made a di&s;covery of his Grace and Faithfulne&s;s, and the &s;ufficiency of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o that you have been bold to ca&s;t your &s;elf on him, then you are Converted. It may be you may have many &s;cruples ri|&s;ing in your hearts, becau&s;e you find a great deal of corruption remaining, and the di&s;co|veries are not repeated &s;o often as you hear it is with &s;ome others; or Prayers are not an&s;wered; but you are certainly Converted.
<PB N="88" REF="001930_0089_0FBA2183C7C4B948">The&s;e di&s;coveries do beget Faith and Love and Repentance, which will be pre&s;erved and renewed in the heart, and will end in eternal Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It may be wrought by Go&s;pel Invitations and Commands.</HI> There by &s;everal gracious Invita|tions in the Go&s;pel. Rev. 22.17. <HI>The &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay come, and let him that is a|thir&s;t come: and whoever will, let him take the waters of life freely.</HI> Rev. 3.18. <HI>I coun&s;el thee it buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may&s;t be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayst be clothed.</HI> In the&s;e Invitations God deals truly and uprightly: God doth not make vain &amp; fallacious pretentions of kindne&s;s, but tells his very heart to Men; He don't go about to lead them into a &s;nare, and make appearances as if he were more kind and gracious than he is. There be al&s;o po&s;itive commands. 1 Joh. 3.2. <HI>This is his commandment that we &s;hould believe on the name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Joh. 6.29. <HI>This is the work of God, that ye be|lieve on him, whom he hath &s;ent.</HI> God has put forth his divine authority; He don't only allow us but requires us to believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and he will not command to tru&s;t in a broken reed; he will not enjoyn us to tru&s;t in a lie. And if you have &s;een the Grace of God in the&s;e Invitations, &s;o that not|with&s;tanding your great unworthine&s;s, and your provocations, you have been bold to accept his offers, and if you have &s;een the truth of the Go&s;pel in tho&s;e commands, that
<PB N="89" REF="001930_0090_0FBA2185A8BB5670">it mu&s;t needs be a &s;afe thing to tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, and from the incouragement of Gods Word, venture on Chri&s;t, you are Conver|ted.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It may be by Go&s;pel declarations.</HI> There be many declarations of the truth of the Go&s;|pel. As, 1 Tim. 10 15. <HI>This is a faithful &s;ay|ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Je|&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.3. <HI>Chri&s;t died for our &s;ins, according to the Scriptures.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.24. <HI>Him&s;elf bore our &s;ins in his own body on the tree.</HI> Sometimes God lets light into the Soul, by one of the&s;e, or &s;ome other word to like purpo&s;e, or by the general doctrine of the Go&s;pel though you had no particular word. God has &s;hewed you the truth and glory of the Go&s;pel, it is a &s;ure &s;ign that you are Converted. There be indeed &s;ome common illuminations, that do for the pre&s;ent affect the hearts of Men, that many have had and yet they remain Unconverted; but when the &s;pirit of God convinces Men of the divine and &s;aving vertue that is in the blood of Chri&s;t, they do immediately turn to God. If the Father that is in Heaven doth reveal Je&s;us to be the Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God: If the Comforter doth convince Men of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; that is a &s;ufficient evidence of Conver&s;ion, and that evidence will not go alone. 1 The&s;. 5.13. <HI>Ye heard the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God, which worketh effectu|ally in you that believe.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE, IV.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Of Conviction, That there is &s;ufficient ground in the Go&s;pel to make Men turn to God.</HI> This is the In&s;trument that God works by; and when it is indeed under&s;tood it always pre|vails. Many Men hear the Go&s;pel, but the light don't &s;hine into them; the Go&s;pel is hid to them, and they remain in their Na|tural condition. But every Man who&s;e eyes are opened to &s;ee the Truth and Glory of the things therein revealed, doth turn to God. The Go&s;pel will then have prevailing Efficacy. Some things the more they are under&s;tood, the more they are de&s;pi&s;ed; but if the Go&s;pel be indeed under&s;tood it is evermore &s;uccesful; there is not a Man in the World, that ever failed of being Converted in this ca&s;e. And we may conclude from thence, that there is rea&s;on for Men to do &s;o; for ignorance of the Go&s;pel hinders Mens Conver&s;ion, but the knowledge of it doth effect it.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t needs be &s;o:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con&s;idering that there is great good offered.</HI> That is offered in the Go&s;pel that will &s;a|tisfy the Soul. Men take a great deal of pains for &s;mall things; but the good offered in the Go&s;pel, comprehends all that Men need. The good he offers there is better than Lord&s;hips, and Principalities and Kingdoms; he offers that which is better than Long-Life, that which Men &s;tand in nece&s;&s;ity of, and
<PB N="91" REF="001930_0092_0FBA2189C0CF2358">indeed all that is nece&s;&s;ary. He offers more good than we can comprehend; Peace with God pa&s;&s;es all Under&s;tanding. The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Becau&s;e God could &s;wear by no greater, he &s;wear by him&s;elf.</HI> So I may &s;ay, becau&s;e he could offer nothing greater, he has offered him&s;elf. 1 Pet. 5.10. <HI>He hath called us to his Eternal Glory by Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This good can be attained in no other way.</HI> There have been many other ways thought of: They generally center in Mens own righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, but that will not &s;erve their turn. No Man ever did pro&s;per in that way. The Jews did <HI>not attain to the Law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e they &s;ought it, as it were by the works of the Law,</HI> Rom. 9.31, 32. That way is in|con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice, but God will offer no violence to his law. <HI>No jot or tittle of the Law &s;hall pa&s;s, but all &s;hall be fulfilled,</HI> Mat. 5.18. God will not vary one hairs breadth from the Law. He had rather that his own Son &s;hould die, than ca&s;t the lea&s;t contempt on the Law: and if the Law &s;tand in force, the works of the Law can't ju&s;tify. Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the deeds of the Law &s;hall no fle&s;h living be justifyed in the &s;ight of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is great &s;ecurity, that the good offered in the Go&s;pel &s;hall be obtained in that way.</HI> We have foundation enough to depend upon. God &s;ent Chri&s;t for this end, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. He is appointed of God to be the foundation of the Church, <HI>I&s;ai</HI> 28.16. and God never had a repenting thought of this contrivance.
<PB N="92" REF="001930_0093_0FBA218BD954C1A8">P&s;al. 110.4. <HI>God has &s;worn and will not repent, thou art a Prie&s;t for ever after the order of Mel|chizedeck.</HI> There is a divine vertue in the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t. <HI>God has purcha&s;ed the Church with his own blood,</HI> Act. 20.28. And the word of God is a full &s;ecurity. God has promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in this way: He has pro|mi&s;ed it upon record under his hand: He has promi&s;ed it on Oath, and has appointed Seals to his Covenant; this is not a founda|tion of uncertain hope, but of &s;trong con&s;o|lation, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.17, 18. This is enough to give Men boldne&s;s in a dying day. <HI>The words of the Lord are pure words as &s;ilver tried in a furnace of earth, purifyed &s;even times,</HI> P&s;al. 12.6.</P>

It is prai&s;e-worthy, and a great commendation in them, when they Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord. It is a Mercy when God be&s;tows &s;ui|table comforts on Young Men and Maidens, Zech. 9.17. <HI>How great is his goodne&s;s, and how great is his beauty?

Young Ones are called on in Scripture to prai&s;e and glorify God. Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember thy cre|ator in the days of thy Youth.</HI> P&s;al. 34.11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> Many things are needful to compleat the happine&s;s of a People: and this is very needful among others.

<P><HI>A.</HI> When they carry &s;o as is for his prai&s;e.</P>

<PB N="96" REF="001930_0097_0FBA2196DD568F20">The proper bu&s;ine&s;s of wor&s;hip is glorifying God; when they wor&s;hip him they honour him as God. P&s;al. 29.9. <HI>In his Temple doth every one &s;peak of his glory.</HI> Divine wor&s;hip is too great an honour to be given to any Creature. Rev. 19.10. <HI>Wor&s;hip God.</HI> So Men glorify God, when they Pray to him, and do in religious manner ask ble&s;&s;ings of him, and do a&s;cribe the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoy unto him. They therein give a te&s;timony to the Almigh|ty Power and Goodne&s;s of God, and they ac|knowledge their dependance on him. Pray|er is Prai&s;e: the language of Prayer is, <HI>Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory.</HI> Math. 6.13. So a religious Attending on the Preaching of the Word, is a Prai&s;ing of God. When they are hearing the Word with reve|rence, they therein acknowledge the Autho|rity and Maje&s;ty of God, and his Divine Truth &amp; Faithfulne&s;s: We therein acknow|ledge that his Word is the rule of Faith and Life. That his Word is able to make us wi&s;e unto Salvation; that it is worthy to be belie|ved and obeyed. Act. 10.33. <HI>We are all here pre&s;ent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</HI> So a religious Singing of P&s;alms, is giving glory to God. P&s;al. 147.1. <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord, for it is good to &s;ing prai&s;es to our God.</HI> So a religious receiving the Seals of Gods Covenant, is prai&s;ing God.

<P N="2">2. <HI>By an holy Conver&s;ation.</HI> An holy walk is a practical acknowledgement of the glori|ou&s;ne&s;s of God.

1. Rea&s;. <HI>God de&s;erves it from them as well as from Elder People.</HI> It is to be de&s;ired on Gods account: It is an honour due to his Name.

Lam, 3.27. <HI>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.</HI> God is their Creater as well as of El|der Per&s;ons. Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember thy Crea|tor in the days of thy youth.</HI> They owe their Being to God, and becau&s;e they owe their Be|ing, they owe their Obedience: and they live upon the Mercies of God, as well as Elder Per&s;ons; they dwell on his Earth, breath in his Air, are enlightned by him, and tho' they are in their &s;trength, yet they depend upon the care of God, for their Food and Raiment, Life &amp; Health.

Math. 28.19, 20. <HI>Lo, I am with you alway to the end if the world.</HI> This is fulfilled in various degrees; and it is matter of great lamentation, when there is but a little ble&s;&s;ing upon Ordinances; when the hearts of Men are made fat: as <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 6.9, 10. But when Young Men and Maids do prai&s;e the Name of God, it is a &s;ign that the Spirit of God is pre&s;ent among them.

I&s;ai. 44.3. <HI>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy Seed and my ble&s;&s;ing upon thy Offspring.</HI> This is more a great deal than for God to ble&s;s the labour of their hands. Godly Men are wont to Pray much for a ble&s;&s;ing on Ordinances, they look upon that as a foundation of many other Mercies. And when Young Ones prai&s;e God, they take notice of the goodne&s;s of God in hearing their Prayers; it is a &s;mile upon the People.</P>

They that are Young now are like to be the pillars of the Church, thirty Years hence. Antient Peo|ple mu&s;t die quickly, but if Young Ones are hearty in Religion; it is hopeful Religion will not die. There is rea&s;on to hope that mo&s;t of them that are religious when they are Young, will continue to be &s;o when they are Old. There is rea&s;on to hope that they that flori&s;h now in Gods hou&s;e, <HI>will &s;till bring forth fruit in old age,</HI> P&s;al. 92.13, 14. That <HI>when the outward man decays, the inner man will be renew|ed,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.16. And therefore it is a great encouragement to &s;ee &s;uch embracing Reli|gion. If Religion be upheld in the next Ge|neration, it mu&s;t be by tho&s;e that are Young now; the burden will lie upon them after a while.</P>
<P N="4">4.

Therefore the wi&s;e Man gives that warning: Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce O Young in thy Youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the &s;ight of thine eyes, but know thou, that for all the&s;e things God will being thee into Judgment.</HI> But when they have a religious Spirit and Conver&s;ation, they are in the way to Salvation. If God de&s;igns to bring Men to Salvation, he will make them
<PB N="101" REF="001930_0102_0FBA1D9243F9DE38">to &s;eek after it: and more generally he makes them &s;eek it in the days of their Youth; Re|forming their Manners, crying to God, &s;tu|dying the Scriptures, waiting upon God in his Ordinances, are the Means to prepare Men for Eternal Life: And when the Spirit of Young Ones is much that way, there is occa|&s;ion to rejoyce in the hopes of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ternal Felicity. 2 Epi&s;t. Joh. 4. <HI>I rejoyced greatly that I found of thy Children walking in truth.</HI></P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>Then there is great need that Parents &s;hould train up their Children religiou&s;ly.</HI> Parents are generally careful to bring up their Children to &s;ome Calling, that they may be fitted to do Service to them&s;elves, and others; but they &s;hould be careful to be&s;tow religi|ous Education on them. Prov. 22.6. <HI>Train up a Child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI> Eph. 6.4. <HI>Bring them up in the nurture and admenition of the Lord.</HI> Something is generally done that way, but with too much remi&s;sne&s;s. Neglects this way is one of the things, wherein the degene|racy of the Land doth appear: many Parents are not religious them&s;elves, and it is no won|der that they are negligent in the Education of their Children. But there is great need of it; Children are corrupt by nature; though they have natural Con&s;ciences urging them to that that is good, yet they have depraved di&s;|po&s;itions prompting them to evil. There is a natural contrariety in them to the ways of God.
<PB N="102" REF="001930_0103_0FBA1D942C1241D0">Rom. 8.7. <HI>The natural mind is enmity to God.</HI> And there be many temptations to mi&s;lead them: There be a multitude of temptations to draw forth their corruptions; and there is need of more care than many Parents do take, that they may prai&s;e the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By In&s;truction. It is not &s;ufficient that they are brought to Publick Wor&s;hip, and that they be learn't to Read the Word of God,</HI> but Parents &s;hould &s;ee that they profit by Publick Means, and they &s;hould be in&s;tilling the Principles of Religion into them. <HI>Timothy</HI> had a god|ly Mother, and he was ver&s;ed in the holy Scriptures from a Child, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. And as Parents &s;hould in&s;truct their Children in Principles of Faith, &s;o al&s;o they &s;hould teach them rules of Obedience. That was one of the de&s;igns of the book of Proverbs. Prov. 1.4. <HI>To give &s;ubtilty to the &s;imple, to the Young man knowledge and di&s;cretion.</HI> The law of nature is much obliterated, and there is great need that the Precepts thereof &s;hould be often in|culcated, that convincing light &s;hould be &s;et before them, that they be urged and ex|po&s;tulated with, and that rules be pre&s;&s;ed upon them. Prov. 31.2, 3. <HI>What my &s;on, and what the &s;on of my womb, and what the &s;on of my vows, give not thy &s;trength unto women,</HI> &amp;c. Young People are giddy and heedle&s;s, and coun&s;el had need to be often renewed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By Example. Bad examples are very in|fections: had examples teach iniquity; irritate corruption, and make men bold to tran&s;gre&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="001930_0104_0FBA1D9544843448">And if Parents give bad examples to their Children, it will be no wonder if they tread in their &s;teps. Men live by examples more than by Precepts. <HI>Jeroboams</HI> example did mi&s;chief to all the &s;ucceeding Kings of I&s;rael. But if Parents give good examples, that is a ground of hope, that Children will follow them; good examples are lovely &amp; amiable, and commend them&s;elves to the Con&s;ciences of Children, the hearts of Men give an ap|probation to them, and are drawn on to a liking of tho&s;e ways; they look on the good examples of their Parents as the honour of their Parents and their honour, and the love they have to their Parents makes their good carriages more lovely in their eyes.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By Re&s;traint. It was</HI> Eli'<HI>s fault that he did not re&s;train his Children.</HI> 1 Sam. 3.13. <HI>His &s;ons made them&s;elves vile and he re&s;trained them not.</HI> Parents, have authority to do it, and if other means will not do they mu&s;t exert their au|thority. It is not enough for Parents, that they do not approve of the iniquities of their Children, they may not &s;uffer them to carry &s;infully. A toleration of iniquity in Children makes the Parents culpable, and to be parta|kers of their &s;ins. Some Children are much more teachable than others, and there is no need of re&s;training them, but others are vio|lently &s;et in ways of &s;in, and it don't per|plex their Con&s;ciences to go directly again&s;t the commands of Parents; in &s;uch ca&s;es Pa|rents mu&s;t re&s;train them: this is the way to
<PB N="104" REF="001930_0105_0FBA1D9930674410">prevent the breaking out of iniquity, and to mend their hearts al&s;o. Fond indulging of Children is the way to ruine them: Chil|dren left to them&s;elves do many times bring their Parents to &s;hame.</P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>Of Examination. Whether Young Men &amp; Maidens do Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord?</HI> It becomes us to take notice of this, that we may &s;ee what cau&s;e we have of rejoycing or of &s;orrow. It is worth the while to ob&s;erve not only how Rulers carry, and how the bo|dy of the People carry, but likewi&s;e to mind what Spirit doth appear in Young ones; they that are Young now are like to have a great influence upon Publick affairs after a while, and the better they carry them&s;elves, the more hope there is of their being &s;erviceable after|wards. Young ones had need particularly con&s;ider, whether they do their duty in Prai|&s;ing the Name of God, whether they an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectation of God and Man in this particular: Do you prai&s;e the Name of the Lord?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some are di&s;orderly in the Night time.</HI> Pa|rents make them work diligently in the Day time; but in the evening they gather toge|ther in companies, and &s;pend their time in unprofitable talk: They are like the bea&s;ts that creep forth in the Night. P&s;al. 104.20. <HI>Thou makest darkne&s;t and it is night, wherein all the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t do creep forth.</HI> It is hard to give an account how they &s;pend their time,
<PB N="105" REF="001930_0106_0FBA1D9C409E8608">but they are di&s;orderly: when the Family at|tends Religious duties, they are abroad, and no account can be given of them. Is this to Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord? They &s;hould joyn with the Family in confe&s;&s;ing &s;in, beg|ging mercy and acknowledging Gods good|ne&s;s; but they don't regard the wor&s;hip of God: Can we think that the&s;e Per&s;ons are con&s;cientious, in attending &s;ecret duties of wor&s;hip? Neglects of Family wor&s;hip are a great contempt of God: Are the&s;e per&s;ons con|cerned for the honour of God or the &s;alvation of their own Souls? Have they any due re|gard to the commands of God? doth it lie upon their hearts to give God the Glory of their daily mercies? Do they not plainly manife&s;t, that they have not the &s;pirit of Re|ligion? they run into danger. Prov. 27.8. <HI>As a bird that wandreth from his nest, &s;o is a man that wandreth from his place.</HI> Is this for the prai&s;e of the Name of God, that when the Family go to bed, the Young Man is running about the Town? he has no bu&s;ine&s;s, it is for the &s;atisfaction of &s;ome ju&s;t; he throws him|&s;elf into temptation, and &s;ometimes he gets a wound and a blot.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some of them frequent the Tavern.</HI> The Tavern is a place of re&s;ort: there is a great deal of company in the Evening, on wet days, and on publick days. There they are &s;pending their time unprofitably: There is a great deal of vain, worldly, proud di&s;|cour&s;e, and corrupt communication: they
<PB N="106" REF="001930_0107_0FBA1D9E36C291E8">are &s;waggering &amp; vaporing; &s;ometimes they are jeering good Men, and &s;co&s;ting at Religi|on. Is this prai&s;ing the Name of the Lord? Is this an honour to God? They are not re|deeming the time as the rule is, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.16. They &s;tand about the cup, till they have en|flamed one another. I&s;ai. 5.11. <HI>They continue until night, till wine enflame them.</HI> They drink till they are giddy, and &s;ometimes talk wan|tonly; &s;ometimes they quarrel and reproach one another; is this to prai&s;e the Name of the Lord? Prov. 23.29, 30. <HI>Who hath wo, who hath &s;orrow, who hath contentions, who hath babling, who hath wounds without cau&s;e, who hath redne&s;s of eyes, they that tarry long at the wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt wine.</HI> At the Tavern they wa&s;t what they have earned, the fruit of their labour is con&s;umed; and they are un|der temptation to cheat &amp; extort to get more. Taverns are the nur&s;eries of prophane&s;s: if the Men talk of Religion, they talk of it in an irreligious way; their di&s;cour&s;es are not &s;a|voury: God would not have the le&s;s honour if they were dead and rotten.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Some are given to wanton dalliances.</HI> Men and Maids will be in company together, toy|ing &amp; dallying; they are &s;tirring up corrup|tion in one another. This is not to prai&s;e the Name of the Lord. They go to Meeting on the Sabbath day &amp; at night they are &s;port|ing with one another: If they would medi|tate on what they have heard, &amp; pray over the word, that would be for their profit, but they
<PB N="107" REF="001930_0108_0FBA1D9FC9332DC8">get together, &amp; it is a &s;hame to &s;peak of what they do. Eph. 5.12. <HI>It is a &s;hame to &s;peak of tho&s;e things that are done of them in &s;ecret.</HI> This is not to prai&s;e the Name of the Lord. They watch for one anothers company, as the Ea|gle doth for its prey, &amp; are making provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof. When they have been hearing of a Sermon, they get together and are gratifying their carnal af|fection with wanton talk and ge&s;tures; they throw them&s;elves into great temptations, and are in danger to commit Whoredom: there be many awful in&s;tances, of per&s;ons that have brought blemi&s;hes upon them&s;elves, &amp; brought them&s;elves to &s;hame thereby.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Some neglect the Wor&s;hip of God.</HI> They come univer&s;ally to hear the word of God upon the Sabbath, and generally at other times: how they do attend the &s;ecret duties of Religion, God &amp; their own Con&s;ciences do know, there is rea&s;on enough to &s;u&s;pect many of them; but there be &s;carce five or &s;ix of them in a Town, that do attend the Lords Supper. The Lords Supper is a Memorial of the death of Chri&s;t, therein <HI>we &s;hew forth the Lords death,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.26. Do the&s;e Men prai&s;e the Name of the Lord, when they turn their backs on this Ordinance, and refu&s;e to celebrate this Memorial of Chri&s;ts Pa&s;&s;ion, and to give a te&s;timony to the truth of the Go&s;pel? The Lords Supper is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace: God therein &s;ets his Seal to the &s;aving vertue of the blood of Chri&s;t: and do they
<PB N="108" REF="001930_0109_0FBA1DA17960D7C0">prai&s;e the Name of the Lord, when they refu&s;e to receive the Seal of the Covenant? God in this Ordinance makes an offer of Chri&s;t as &s;lain for our Redemption; and do they prai&s;e the Name of the Lord that refu&s;e to attend it? The coming to this Ordinance is an open ac|knowledgment of the truth of the Go&s;pel; what is the neglecting of it then but an open denial of the truth of the Go&s;pel? Some it may be do neglect it from tenderne&s;s of Con|&s;cience, fearing whether they have liberty to come; but many others do neglect it from a carele&s;s &amp; irreligious &s;pirit, they neither come to it, nor are careful to prepare them&s;elves for it.</P>
<P>USE, III. <HI>Of Exhortation, To prai&s;e the Name of the Lord. David</HI> calls on Young Men and Maids to do it; and indeed God calls on you to do it. This work is not left to old People, God expects it from you al&s;o: You may not &s;ay that elder People do it now, and you will take your turn when you are older, but heartily engage in this work: if it has been neglected hitherto, let it be neglected no long|er; don't rob God of his glory. It is a glo|rious employment to prai&s;e God; the Angels of Heaven do employ them&s;elves that way: this is a debt, you owe to God: he is worthy to be prai&s;ed, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18.3. His Name alone is excellent. Prai&s;e him in all ways of wor&s;hip. Prai&s;e him in all ways of Obedience.</P>
<P>Motives, 1. <HI>All Creatures in the world do it, but Devils &amp; wicked men.</HI> There is great va|riety
<PB N="109" REF="001930_0110_0FBA1DA485FEB6B8">of Creatures in Heaven &amp; Earth; and they do with one voice proclaim the glory of God. If we look up to Heaven, there the An|gels are prai&s;ing God: Tho&s;e Morning Stars &s;ing together: the heavenly Ho&s;ts do prai&s;e God: the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars of light. Look into the Air, there the Clouds &amp; Winds &amp; the Meteors prai&s;e God. Look unto the Earth &amp; the Sea, and all Creatures therein do give a te&s;timony for God. P&s;al. 145.10. <HI>All thy works &s;hall prai&s;e thee.</HI> Indeed the Devils do re|proach God, tho&s;e cur&s;ed creatures are enemies to the honour of God; and a number of Men are drawn in to fall in with the &s;ame de&s;ign. Will you &s;eparate your &s;elves from the re&s;t of the Creatures, to joyn in with the Devils and a crew of ungodly men? When the greate&s;t part of the world are agreed to exalt God, will you for&s;ake them &amp; joyn with the Devil? It becomes you to &s;ay as <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 103.21, 22. <HI>Ble&s;s ye the Lord all ye his ho&s;ts, ye Ministers of his that do his plea&s;ure: Ble&s;s the Lord all his works, in all places of his dominion; ble&s;s the Lord O my &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This will be no burden to you when you come to die.</HI> The living know that they mu&s;t die. You don't expect to continue here always: You are but Strangers in the world, and you don't know but you may die quickly; there is nothing in your Nature, or condition, or in the word of God, that doth &s;ecure long life unto you. <HI>Man is as gra&s;s, &amp; the glory of man as the flower of the field that fadeth away,</HI> I&s;ai.

And if you don't prai&s;e God, that will make it hard work to die: if you han't done the work that you were &s;ent into the World for, that will be heavier than the pains of death: it will &s;ting you to remember your life pa&s;t: how will you dare to go before God to Judgment? It is a doleful condition, when you mu&s;t die, and yet dare not die. Eccl. 5.17. <HI>He hath much &s;orrow &amp; wrath with his &s;ickne&s;s.</HI> Con&s;cience will lay that charge upon you, Dan. 5.23. <HI>The God in who&s;e hand thy breath is, and who&s;e are all thy ways, thou has not glorified.</HI> And you will take up that lamentation, Prov. 5.12, 13. <HI>How have I hated in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof; I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ears to them that in&s;tructed me.</HI> But if you improve your time in &s;erving God, that will be no affliction to you in the evil day, but a comfort; it will be an ea&s;e in death, a relief under your pains, a cordial again&s;t faintings. That was a great comfort to <HI>Hezekiah</HI> when he lay at the point of death. I&s;ai. 28.3. <HI>He &s;aid, Remember now Lord I be&s;eech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI> If you don't prai&s;e the Lord, you would (in vain) de&s;ire that God would forget what you had done; it will be a terrour to you to remember and to think that God doth remember what you have done.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If you dont prai&s;e the Lord, it will make your life uncomfortable. The ways of wi&s;dom are ways
<PB N="111" REF="001930_0112_0FBA1DA8EFF6EA58">of plea&s;antne&s;s, &amp; all her paths are peace,</HI> Prov. 3.17. <HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>It is plea&s;ant to &s;ing prai&s;e to the Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 147.1. It is agreeable to the nature of Man to walk in the ways of upright|ne&s;s. Men are then in their element, it is the per|fection of nature: &amp; it is agreeable to the Con|&s;cience of Man, that approves &amp; applauds an holy life. But unholy living is uncomfortable living. If Men neglect to &s;erve God, they put them&s;elves upon the rack: if Men live a life of di&s;obedience, they live a mi&s;erable life: they don't enjoy them&s;elves; corruptions are hard ma&s;ters. <HI>The wicked is like the troubled Sea that cannot rest, I&s;ai.</HI> 57 20.

When they hear the rebukes of the word, their own hearts do eccho thereunto; and their own Con&s;cience is making apparitions of danger, &amp; threatning of them with the vengeance of God Some are more &s;tupid than others, but upon many occa|&s;ions Con&s;cience will be terrifying them, they have many frightful expectations. Job 15 21. <HI>A dreadful &s;ound is in his ears.</HI> They have aw|ful preoccupations of hell. They are &s;cared with Death &amp; of Judgment: Sometimes they think of the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever;

<P N="4">4. <HI>God gave you rea&s;onable Souls for this end that you may prai&s;e the Name of the Lord.</HI> God has given rational Souls to you that you might under&s;tandingly prai&s;e the Lord. Surely God is angry with Men if they don't u&s;e their Souls to that end that they were made for: He will count them worthy to be de&s;troyed. And this was the end of your Souls, they are fitted for this end, made capable to know &amp; prai&s;e God. Why do you imagine that God has en|dued you with rational Souls? Was it only to keep your body from putrifying? The &s;oul of a bea&s;t would have &s;erved that occa&s;ion. Some bea&s;ts that have only &s;en&s;itive &s;ouls live longer than Men do.

The bruit creatures being de&s;titute of rational Souls are not capable to rebel, they can't &s;in or di&s;honour God, and carry to his reproach: and did God advance you to an higher pitch of excellency, and give you a Soul of a &s;uperiour nature, endued with an|gelical
<PB N="113" REF="001930_0114_0FBA1DAE4625BB00">faculties that you might carry like De|vils? Did God make you better than the bea&s;ts of the earth, that you might make your &s;elves wor&s;e than them? &s;urely it was not worth the while for you to be made to di&s;honour God. You were made to glorify God, and if this be not done by you, you don't an&s;wer the end of your creation.

The account that mu&s;t be given of many Per&s;ons is, that they mind little but the World; they are nothing for Religion; they are &s;wallowed up in the cares of the World; they have &s;omewhat of a Form of goodline&s;s, but no|thing of the Power; they are panting after the du&s;t of the earth; they don't &s;avour of a gracious Spirit. They go to Meeting on the Sabbath &amp; at other times, but the cares of the World do choke the Seed of the Word. And the account that mu&s;t be given of others is, that they are Phari&s;aical, Proud Creatures, mind little but their Ornaments: Or that they are of rude beha|viour; when they &s;hould be in bed they are a|broad in company with Wenches, or that they lie about the Taverns; that they are companions of fools. One would think it &s;hould go to your heart, to con&s;ider, what di&s;cour&s;e there is in Heaven a|bout you; to have an ill name here is a &s;hame, but it is more &s;hameful to have an ill name in Hea|ven: you may well blu&s;h to think that it &s;hould be told in Heaven, that much pains has been taken with you, but that hitherto it is all in vain.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>If you will not Prai&s;e the Name of the Lord upon Earth, you &s;hall not do it in Heaven.</HI> Prai&s;ing God is heavenly work; Saints &amp; Angels will &s;pend an Eternity in Prai&s;ing &amp; Magnifying God; they will be making Melody to the Lord; and you think they will be very happy, according to that, P&s;al. 84.4. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy hou&s;e, they will be &s;till prai&s;ing thee.</HI> But if you neg|lect to prai&s;e God here, God will not admit you among the holy ones there, that are prai&s;ing him. There will be a glorious company in Heaven, &amp;
<PB N="116" REF="001930_0117_0FBA1DB2C402A838">you would fain be one among the re&s;t; you will beg to be admitted, you have de&s;ires that way now, you have your pangs wherein you long to go to Heaven. Numb. 23.10. <HI>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his.</HI> And when you are going out of the World, you will cry earne&s;tly to God to admit you, and will fill your Mouths with arguments; but you will be rejected God will have no compa&s;&s;ion on you, but will harden his heart again&s;t you. He will remem|ber what a life you led here, how you neglected to glorify him, how you did not own his Authority, you did not render to him the glory of his Faith|fulne&s;s; how you preferred other things before him: And he will &s;top his ears again&s;t your crys. He wont object again&s;t you that you were poor &amp; low in the World, or the unholine&s;s of your Pa|rentage, but his objection will be, that you did not honour him. For he &s;ays, <HI>They that honour me, I will honour,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.30. And he will not admit you. <HI>Math.</HI> 25.11, 12. The fooli&s;h Virgins <HI>&s;aid, Lord, Lord open to us, but he an&s;wered &amp; &s;aid, Verily, I &s;ay unto you, I know you not.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>If you won't prai&s;e the Name of the Lord on Earth, you mu&s;t do it in Hell.</HI> It is commonly &s;aid, that wicked men in hell will bla&s;pheme God; and I do not deny it: that is applyed to them, Rev. 16.11. <HI>They bla&s;phemed the God of heaven becau&s;e of their plagues, and becau&s;e of their &s;ores:</HI> Though that is &s;poken directly of Antichri&s;tians, when God brings his Judgments upon them. But un|godly men in Hell &s;hall prai&s;e God: God will prai&s;e him&s;elf by executing mi&s;ery on them; he will &s;hew forth his own glory when he executes revenge upon them; as he did when he brought his plagues upon <HI>Egypt: He cau&s;ed his Name to be declared through the Earth.</HI> But be&s;ides this he will extort prai&s;e from you: now you are
<PB N="117" REF="001930_0118_0FBA1DB4C2B4C3A8">ready to flatter your &s;elf as if you were in no danger; then you &s;hall acknowledge that God is &s;tronger than you; that there is no darkne&s;s now &s;hadow of death, where the workers of iniquity &s;hall hide them&s;elves; then you &s;hall acknowledge your folly &amp; madne&s;s in with&s;tanding the graci|ous calls of God. You will be found likewi&s;e to own the Ju&s;tice of God. Now Men have rea&s;o|nings in their hearts again&s;t it; but then they &s;hall be forced to give a te&s;timony for it. Rom. 3.19. <HI>Every mouth &s;hall be &s;topped &amp; all the world &s;hall become guilty before God.</HI> As Pharaoh acknow|ledged Gods Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Exod. 9.27. <HI>The Lord is righteous, &amp; I &amp; my people are wicked.</HI> Before they would not believe the faithfulne&s;s of God in his threatnings; now they will &s;ay as, 1 Sam. 7.29. <HI>The &s;trength of I&s;rael will not lie nor repent, for he is not a Man that he &s;hould repent.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 1. <HI>It may be objected, That it is not the manner of Young Men &amp; Maids to &s;erve &amp; glorify God: if they &s;hould do it they &s;hould be &s;ingular: they must do as others do.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This is no vindication of you. Irreligion is wickedne&s;s though there be never &s;o many that practice it. The multitude of Sinners is no ju&s;ti|&s;ication of &s;in: neither is it any &s;ecurity: if hand joyn in hand the wicked &s;hall not be unpani&s;hed. Multitudes of Young ones are burning in Hell for their iniquities. If you heard their groans, you would have little heart to follow their example. Neither are the&s;e bad examples an in&s;uperable temptation. <HI>Samuel &amp; David, Solomon &amp; Jo&s;iah,</HI> did vanqui&s;h this temptation, and &s;o may you too.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. <HI>Now is our only time to enjoy our plea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It would be no lo&s;s to you, if you never did enjoy the plea&s;ure of Sin. There be plea|&s;ures to be injoyed in a way of Religion, &amp; they are far better, le&s;s cloying, more &s;ub&s;tantial, and
<PB N="118" REF="001930_0119_0FBA1DB92016AD08"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> durable: the plea&s;ures of Sin have &s;tings in them. Prov. 23.32. <HI>At la&s;t they bite like a &s;er|pent and &s;ting like an adder.</HI> Eccl. 11.9. <HI>Know that for all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> You may get &s;uch a wound by indulging your &s;elves in the plea&s;ures of Sin, that may never be cured. And it may be now is your only time, to &s;ecure eternal life: you have no a&s;&s;urance of any time hereafter to do it. The cour&s;e of Na|ture don't &s;ecure it unto you. There is no pro|mi&s;e from God to &s;ecure it to you: and you are warned to take the pre&s;ent time. I&s;ai. 55.6. <HI>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call you upon him, while he is near.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 3. <HI>It is not to be expected that we &s;hould be as good us Elder People: we are not guilty of any great Extravagances: You would not have us to be as Religious and as Preci&s;e as Elderly Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If you be not better than &s;ome Elderly Profe&s;&s;ors be, you will never enter into the King|dom of God. Men go under an apprehen&s;ion that a little Religion will &s;ecure Salvation, and &s;o they give way to worldline&s;s and lukewarmne&s;s, and loo&s;e walking; and they that will run the ventue of it may: But a&s;&s;uredly the way to life is narrow: Some that have a Name that they live, are dead. There may be &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s &amp; &s;obriety, and con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s and affection, and zeal, and yet Per&s;ons may be in a peri&s;hing condition: it is a mighty change that prepares Men for Salva|tion. And I am afraid that the un&s;avoury car|riages of &s;ome Elder Profe&s;&s;ors, make &s;ome Young ones to harden their hearts, and to think that a little Religion will &s;erve the turn; but you &s;hould remember the words of Chri&s;t: Math. 5.20. <HI>Ex|cept your righteou&s;ne&s;s do exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees, you &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</HI></P>
