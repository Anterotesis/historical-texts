<P>WE have thought it proper to inform the Reader, that we wrote to our former Brethren &s;ome time pa&s;t, informing them of the following Addre&s;s, and that it was nearly ready for the pre&s;s, giving them an invitation to read it before it was printed, with a view, that if they could di&s;cover, and manife&s;t to us any errors that it contained, we &s;hould be glad to correct them; and if we could have been &s;o happy as to have convinced them of &s;ome mi&s;|takes we think they have made in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e in controver&s;y, we &s;hould not have had occa&s;ion, &s;o publickly&punc; to have expo&s;ed them; but they having had &s;ufficient time to con&s;ider the matter &s;ince we wrote, and we not having received any an&s;wer, conclude they do not intend to give any; we therefore think they will have no ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain of our pro|ceeding to print the following Piece without making any farther application to them.</P>

<HEAD>An ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE concern which our former Brethren have expre&s;&s;ed, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, and at &s;everal times, for the peace and harmony of the the Church, is worthy of attention: But whether they con&s;ider their incorporate Body, or Church, to be &s;o, in di&s;tinction from all others, they have not in this Controver&s;y, clearly told us. If they mean by the true Church, all tho&s;e who are <HI>born again from above by the incorruptible Seed and Word of God, that liveth and abideth forever;</HI> and that the&s;e are not re|&s;tricted to their own Church, but are to be found in every other Chri&s;tian Society all over the World, we freely and fully acquie&s;ce in this &s;entiment&mdash; That this is the &s;incere belief of the Society in general we cannot doubt, or call in que&s;tion; But remark, with concern, that the line of conduct which tho&s;e have pur&s;ued, who were immediately concerned in di&s;own|ing us is not favourable to &s;uch an opinion, which we tru&s;t will be fully evinced before we clo&s;e this Addre&s;s. Whether our idea of the true Church, in every re&s;pect, coincides with theirs mu&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, remain undetermined; but that in what is nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve its <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>unity</HI> we are not, in every re&s;pect, agreed, is very clear from the different mea&s;ures we have pur&s;ued for that purpo&s;e &mdash; We have thought it nece&s;|&s;ary in order&punc; not only to pre&s;erve, but to re&s;tore that peace and unity that hath been di&s;turbed in the Society
<PB N="4" REF="018802_0004_0FA8156133A16070">
by the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, to inve&s;tigate the whole of their conduct, as well as ours, in that ca&s;e, that it might, if po&s;&s;ible, appear who were the faulty cau&s;e of it, which they have con&s;tantly declined &s;ince Timothy Davis was di&s;owned about which the unea&s;ine&s;s on our part, aro&s;e&mdash;how far they laboured to &s;uppre&s;s any thing of that nature before, will, we tru&s;t, in the following lines be manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>They alledge that every Church hath an indi&s;puta|ble right to judge of the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of their members to be continued as &s;uch.</P>
<P>No one, we apprehend, will di&s;pute this; but then it ought to be con&s;idered that it is po&s;&s;ible that a Church may mi&s;u&s;e their members and abu&s;e this right. &mdash;This is what we complain of&mdash;how ju&s;tly we hope al&s;o to make appear to the &s;atisfaction of the unpreju|diced reader.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, that the con&s;titution of their Church is &s;uch that it affords &s;ufficient opportunity for us mem|bers to vindicate their &s;everal cau&s;es while they are under-dealing, by appeals from le&s;&s;er to &s;uperior meet|ings, without tho&s;e meetings being called upon after they have fully heard, con&s;idered, determined and &s;ettled a matter.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, That the Church in general gives this liberty is not the matter in que&s;tion; but whether that right, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, hath been &s;uffered fully and freely to operate without any interruption, is the matter now in que&s;tion, and what we wi&s;h to have fairly held up to light, that it may be made manife&s;t whether their proceedings again&s;t us, or ours in our own defence was dictated and influenced by the Light or not? It is an unhappine&s;s with &s;ome, that they are &s;o prejudiced in favour of their own deeds, they are
<PB N="5" REF="018802_0005_0FA815621090B518">
very aver&s;e to having them brought to the impartial examination of the Light, le&s;t they &s;hould be <HI>reproved:</HI> How far this will apply to our oppo&s;ers, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we &s;ubmit to the unprejudiced part of &s;uch who are acquainted with the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.</P>
<P>We think it not un&s;ea&s;onable here to take notice of what they &s;ay in a Letter &s;uper&s;cribed to Jo&s;eph Taber, and tho&s;e in who&s;e behalf he &s;igned a Letter, dated at Dartmouth 14th 7 mo. 1783. which is as followeth, viz.
<Q>It &s;eems &mdash; you have &s;een fit to attempt a Pro&s;ecution by way of Indictment, a matter of &s;uch a nature, as we apprehend, was never before heard of from any profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be the People called Quakers, and which we think the truly thoughtful among you cannot approve.</Q></P>
<P>We an&s;wer. That it appears inconte&s;tably true, that Friends have frequently had recour&s;e to the civil Powers for redre&s;s, when under oppre&s;&s;ion or per&s;ecution; this would have been nothing more had we been concerned in it &mdash; That there was a Pro&s;e|cution is very true, that happened at Roche&s;ter; oc|ca&s;ioned by one Jonathan Macy's publicly oppo&s;ing Benjamin Bumpus in his publick mini&s;try in Friends Meeting-hou&s;e there, to a very great majority of &s;uch Friends who favoured our cau&s;e: That, under this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;uch oppo&s;ition was not only very inju|dicious, but a very unlawful di&s;turbance, notwith|&s;tanding they might have a right in the Meeting-hou&s;e, yet being a very &s;mall minority they could have no ju&s;t preten&s;ions of a right to di&s;turb &s;o large a majority as there was pre&s;ent at that time, no le&s;s intere&s;ted in the Meeting hou&s;e than they. But Macy, with his attendance, it &s;eems, by the afore|&s;aid Letter, were &s;ent to pre&s;erve <HI>Peace</HI> and good
<PB N="6" REF="018802_0006_0FA815639AABCDF8">
<HI>Order;</HI> but unhappy for them, they either forgot their errand, or tho&s;e from whom they received it did not under&s;tand the nature of &s;uch an errand. If &s;uch di&s;turbances as this be the effects of &s;uch friendly attention, as they mention in their letter to us, we &s;hould be glad that &s;uch marks of it might not be often repeated, otherwi&s;e their exhortation to patient &s;uffering may want their example to give it weight and energy &mdash; Macy did not pretend to object to what he had heard, but was &s;o incon&s;iderate as to alledge that he had no right to appear in the Mini&s;try there, being di&s;owned. To this right, which is pretended to be forfeited by being di&s;owned by them we &s;hall &s;peak more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the beforementioned Pro&s;e|cution, although it is &s;trongly urged again&s;t us, we know not of any one of our Member being con|cerned in it, either le&s;s or more, directly or indirectly; yet, with gratitude, we acknowlege the kindne&s;s of &s;uch others who ju&s;tly pitied and felt a &s;ympathy for us under our oppre&s;&s;ion, and thought it quite time to endeavour a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch di&s;order. It is a little &s;urpri&s;ing that the Authors of this Letter &s;hould have &s;uffered them&s;elves to have been &s;o impo&s;ed on &mdash;Men in &s;uch high e&s;teem in the Society for their &s;agacity, penetration, judgment and di&s;cerning, one would have thought would have &s;ifted a Ca&s;e with a little more accuracy, wherein their Reputation would nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer, they might know, if this in&s;inuation &s;hould fail: But it is an unhappine&s;s with &s;ome people that they too ea&s;ily yield their a&s;&s;ent to that, which they wi&s;h to be true of &s;uch as they di&s;affect, often to the wounding of their own Reputation at lea&s;t. We think however, that even this mi&s;take, as great as it is,
<PB N="7" REF="018802_0007_0FA815645C2DE9B8">
is capable of being improved to their, and our advan|tage, by affording them &s;uch a le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction as they might not have had, or that they might have overlooked, by leading them to con&s;ider that however great their religious experience hath been, they are yet liable to mi&s;takes, and to be impo&s;ed on by wrong in|formation; and that too from among them&s;elves&mdash; being convinced of this, they may be led to turn their thoughts towards their former conduct, and &s;ee if they cannot find &s;omething out of the line of Truth there, which we think will not be very difficult, if they are di&s;po&s;ed to indulge a little impartial enquiry&mdash; We doubt not but that we &s;hall be able, before we con|clude, to manife&s;t &s;omething in the line of conduct they have pur&s;ued, that will hardly bear the light unrepro|ved, without entering very minutely into every circum|&s;tance of their proceedings again&s;t us, and &s;hall there|fore &s;ay little of the manner in which the Meeting for Sufferings treated the &s;ubject when they fir&s;t took it up; they were however the fir&s;t that di&s;covered to us any unea&s;ine&s;s in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to the before-mentioned Pro&s;ecu|tion; &s;uppo&s;e we had been concerned in it, altho' we were not, yet we think it would have been much more eligible than &s;uch mea&s;ures as have been adopted by Friends formerly, in taking &s;uch by the &s;houlders as they did not approve as Mini&s;ters, and &s;uch who have attempted to &s;it in their meetings of Church Di&s;cipline, whom they did not approve as Members, and leading or forcing them out of a meeting-hou&s;e, &s;ometimes with much difficulty and not a little confu&s;ion, without any authority from any civil Magi&s;trate, but done alto|gether in an arbitrary and forcible manner. If we had approved, and adopted, &s;uch a mode of Conduct we
<PB N="8" REF="018802_0008_0FA81564DD3887A0">
might ea&s;ily have di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch who have given us di&s;turbance where we are a majority; but if ever &s;uch are di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, where we have the rule in any Meet|ing-hou&s;e, it will be, we think by &s;uch authority as is Divinely in&s;tituted for the <HI>puni&s;hment of evil-doers and the prai&s;e of them that do well,</HI> mentioned by the great Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles in the 13th chap. of his Epi&s;tle to the Romans, where he a&s;&s;erts, not only that the in&s;titution of Magi&s;tracy is Divine, but al&s;o the power of the civil Magi&s;trate under that in&s;titution, which we tenderly recommend to their con&s;ideration, and ob&s;erve in the words of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle that when civil Rulers are in their proper places, they are not a "terror to good works, but to the evil:" Not a terror to tho&s;e who meet together peaceably to wor|&s;hip their Maker in the way that they are per&s;uaded he requireth of them, but to tho&s;e who unrea&s;onably di&s;turb them while they are performing this important duty. "Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good and thou &s;hall have prai&s;e of the &s;ame." Let us then not a&s;&s;ume that Authority with which we have no right to intermeddle, never having been legally introduced: But as &s;uch kind of di&s;tur|bances come under the cognizance of civil Juri&s;diction, we ought to &s;ubmit them to their deci&s;ion, if we cannot in a mild amicable manner &s;ettle them between our&s;elves, and not indulge that &s;elfi&s;h dictatorial di&s;po|&s;ition that &s;eeks to be judge in its own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not from an inclination to expo&s;e them as a re|ligious Society, that we expo&s;e their proceedings again&s;t us to public view, but from a nece&s;&s;ity of vindicating our&s;elves again&s;t their charges and in&s;inuations. We have waited long, and &s;uffered much from them unju&s;tly in our religious characters in the Society, while we
<PB N="9" REF="018802_0009_0FA81565A43A94F8">
wi&s;hed tho&s;e of it who were immediately concerned in di&s;owning us to &s;ee and acknowledge their mi&s;takes in their proceedings again&s;t us, that the Society may in general be undeceived, who have accu&s;tomed them&s;elves, too much, to the following of the voices of &s;uch as they take for their leaders, without examining for them&s;elves; which is quite repugnant to that Doctrine that inforceth the nece&s;&s;ity of every one's knowing the Lord for him|&s;elf: Where this is experienced, they not only know him but know him to be their Teacher, which removes the occa&s;ion of that &s;ervile dependence, many have on their Mini&s;ters and &s;ome other active and a&s;&s;uming Members.</P>
<P>As they, by their afore&s;aid Letter, render all hope or encouragement of their being di&s;po&s;ed to recede from their errors in this ca&s;e, we think we &s;hall be excu&s;able, at lea&s;t, in giving a ju&s;t account of &s;ome of their pro|ceedings again&s;t us; but as &s;ome part thereof is unplea|&s;ant to revive, the undertaking will be di&s;agreable; yet as there appears a de&s;ire, in &s;ome well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons in the Society, to be informed how the matter was con|ducted, and they al&s;o being under the influence of mi&s;|repre&s;entation, we feel a willingne&s;s to oblige them.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved, that the Meeting for Suffer|ings was the fir&s;t that manife&s;ted, to us, any unea&s;ine&s;s with Timothy Davis's Piece on Taxation, who have found means to extend their influence through mo&s;t of the proceedings of the Society again&s;t him, which proved to be a circum&s;tance not favourable to his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was, after this, introduced into the Monthly Meeting of Sandwich, and as far as they acted upon it at that time, they proceeded, in general, agreeable to the Rules of the Society, and re&s;tored him to his former &s;tation in the Church, and for that time di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="018802_0010_0FA8156690BE1E18">
the &s;ubject; where it might finally have termi|nated, had it not been for a few di&s;affected members, who, it is probable, with a view to recommend them|&s;elves to &s;ome other members of influence, in other parts of the Country, under the &s;ame prejudices, by &s;ome means or other conveyed it back to the Meeting for Sufferings, where the unea&s;ine&s;s originated, under a preten&s;ion, that the afore&s;aid Monthly Meeting had been mi&s;led: But allowing, for the pre&s;ent, that it had been mi&s;led, which was far from being the ca&s;e, this was not the way to &s;et it right unle&s;s they thought to mend one error by committing another&mdash;According to the Rules e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Society, it ought to have been carried from the Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, by a complaint again&s;t the pro|ceedings of the Monthly Meeting in that ca&s;e; where he would have had a hearing, if they had allowed him the liberty provided in &s;uch ca&s;es, and the Monthly Meeting would have had a right to have vindicated their proceedings in the ca&s;e; but we &s;hall &s;ee, before we conclude, how that Meeting was treated, and how tamely they &s;ubmitted to it, as unrea&s;onable as the demand upon them was.</P>
<P>If it be a&s;ked why they neglected to carry this ca&s;e in the u&s;ual channel to the Quarterly and Yearly Meeting, and why they carried it to the Meeting for Sufferings.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, It is hard to &s;ay, from the circum&s;tances of their proceedings, whether they acted from a want of under&s;tanding their own Rules, or whether they were apprehen&s;ive, that if he was allowed to defend his own cau&s;e, it would render their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t him too precatious. However, be that as it may, the Meeting for Sufferings, when they received it, ought
<PB N="11" REF="018802_0011_0FA8156720502010">
immediately to have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it, with directions to the Monthly Meeting, that if any of her members remained di&s;&s;atisfied, the way was open to the Quar|terly and Yearly Meeting, for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>How tho&s;e di&s;affected members came to meet with &s;uch unju&s;t countenance from the Meeting for Suffer|ings, is hard to reconcile with that ju&s;tice and chri&s;tian decorum that it ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; for, it &s;eems, they thought them&s;elves &s;ufficiently qualified by hear|ing them ex parte, to carry the matter forward to the Yearly Meeting: And they as in&s;en&s;ible of their <HI>duty</HI> and his <HI>right,</HI> proceeded to act upon it ex parte al&s;o.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid they acted no further upon it than to give their advice.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, Admitting they proceeded no further, yet, when we &s;ee how important they con&s;ider their advice, and would have others, we &s;hall find that it falls little &s;hort of a final judgment, e&s;pecially in this ca&s;e; and that the &s;ubordinate Meetings are little more than their executioners in &s;uch ca&s;es.

<P>Here we think none can he&s;itate how important they con&s;ider their advice, and would have their mem|bers&punc; Their non-compliance with it or labouring to ob&s;truct its force &s;ubjects them to a being dealt with, the con&s;equence of which is, if they will not comply, they mu&s;t be di&s;owned: Witne&s;s the ca&s;e of Ebenezer Ga&s;kil, who&s;e di&s;ownment originated in his neglecting a compliance with the advice of the Elders where he lives, concerning his publick appearance in the mini|&s;try, where no doctrinal errors were ever alledged again&s;t him, as we have ever heard of&mdash;As the advice of the yearly Meeting is held in this point of view, and Timothy Davis's ca&s;e not only treated accordingly, but he not having opportunity to vindicate his cau&s;e after their taking it up the &s;econd time, he was virtually judged and condemned unheard.</P>
<P>But it is objected on the contrary, that the yearly Meeting treated the matter with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, that they &s;ent a Committee to treat with him on the &s;ubject in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, that a moderate examination will &s;uffi|ciently manife&s;t this to be a mi&s;take. If there was a Committee appointed by the yearly Meeting for that
<PB N="13" REF="018802_0013_0FA81568A75C1C60">
purpo&s;e, they failed in it, for there never was any com|mittee from them, in that ca&s;e, that vi&s;ited him by a particular appointment, and if there had been one ap|pointed particularly in that ca&s;e, yet if they were only authorized to advi&s;e and admoni&s;h him, and not to hear and determine the matter in di&s;pute, he was never|thele&s;s condemned without a hearing. There was a committee appointed by the yearly Meeting to vi&s;it the monthly or quarterly Meeting of Sandwich, who made it in their way to vi&s;it Timothy, who told them that he could freely receive them in their private capacities, but not as a committee, legally appointed in that &s;ervice, for that matter was never legally before that Meeting, and con&s;equently they could not be a legal committee, therefore he could not confer with them as &s;uch, which to do, would be to countenance &s;uch irregularity as ought to be di&s;countenanced by every judicious con|&s;cientious per&s;on.</P>
<P>As partial and irregular as their proceedings were, the Monthly Meeting, who had before re&s;tored him to his former &s;tation, were reduced to a compliance with the direction of the yearly Meeting, and rea&s;&s;umed the &s;ub|ject, and accordingly &s;oon <HI>di&s;owned</HI> him; who, if they had refu&s;ed, were liable to have been di&s;owned, or to have had their Meeting taken from them, or di&s;&s;olved. This Meeting al&s;o appointed a Committee of admonition to treat with him, but he did not acknowledge their authority, for the rea&s;ons before-mentioned, in the in|&s;tance of the yearly Meeting Committee, he being tender of the religious rights and liberties of his chri&s;tian Brethren. Nor was there the remote&s;t pro&s;pect of his having a free and impartial hearing at this Meeting, circum&s;tanced as it was, under awe of the yearly Meet|ing. Indeed the whole conduct of that Meeting in this
<PB N="14" REF="018802_0014_0FA81569CB7EC790">
ca&s;e, very clearly manife&s;ted that they intended to carry their point; this we were fully convinced of when they fir&s;t took the matter out of its proper channel, after it had been &s;ettled by the Monthly Meeting, and therefore thought it would an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e to follow them in their various, and uncertain windings and turnings from one thing to another, to an&s;wer their partial views.</P>
<P>As the Monthly Meeting had at fir&s;t fully gone into the &s;ubject, and had all the advantage of hearing of it fairly &s;tated and explained, it was no le&s;s than calling upon that Meeting to give judgment twice in one ca&s;e or to execute the judgment of the Yearly Meeting con|trary to their own. Which conduct, to u&s;e an expre&s;|&s;ion of theirs, is not very <HI>&s;avory,</HI> nor can we think, that in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, they are very good judges of what is truly &s;o, in a religious &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The right of defending one's &s;elf before any judges whatever, either civil or religious, is held very &s;acred by all judicious, con&s;cientious people, and ought never to be given up, or infringed by any Society whatever. The Apo&s;tle Paul &s;eems to have had a very clear &s;en&s;e of that liberty when making his defence before King Agrippa, and expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf on that occa&s;ion, as followeth,
<Q>I think my&s;elf happy, King Agrippa, becau&s;e I &s;hall an&s;wer for my&s;elf this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accu&s;ed of the Jews.</Q>
We cannot but doubt that the Yearly Meeting, when they had this matter under con&s;ideration were in&s;en&s;ible of &s;uch tender &s;entiments and feelings, or they would have called upon him to have an&s;wered for him&s;elf, touching all the things whereof he was accu&s;ed, not by the Jews, or Phari&s;ees, but by a Spirit which, we fear, too generally pre&s;ided among them&mdash;
<PB N="15" REF="018802_0015_0FA8156A46ECF6E8">
Perhaps they were apprehen&s;ive, that if he was allowed that liberty, it might be a means of &s;trengthening, if not increa&s;ing his friends, and they could not then be cer|tain but that they might be too powerful for &s;uch who wi&s;hed to prevail again&s;t him.</P>
<P>If there remains any true &s;en&s;e of feeling with tho&s;e who were &s;o active and bu&s;ily employed again&s;t him, it mu&s;t, we think, lay very heavy upon them.</P>
<P>However lo&s;t to this tender religious right any of that Society may be at pre&s;ent, it appears that they, formerly, had a very clear &s;en&s;e of, and regard for if, by their making &s;uch large provi&s;ion for it by appeals from le&s;&s;er to &s;uperior Meetings: Fir&s;t from Monthly to Quarterly, and finally to the Yearly Meeting.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, this practice is &s;till continued.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, the name of it is; but not the u&s;e and de&s;ign of &s;uch appeals, they being &s;uperceded, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, by a partial application being made to the Yearly Meeting for advice. The carrying of it by way of the Meeting for Sufferings to the Yearly Meeting for advice, naturally foreclo&s;eth, and rendereth futile all attempts to appeal to that Meeting.</P>
<P>Whereas, if this chri&s;tian provi&s;ion and care was attended to as it ought, it would very clearly manife&s;t the impropriety, and ab&s;urdity, of calling upon the &s;ame Meeting to give a counter judgment in the &s;ame ca&s;e, or to rever&s;e their former judgment. To make up a judgment in a ca&s;e, no further than to give advice, only by a partial hearing, where a ca&s;e is liable to come by appeal, betrays very great weakne&s;s, as well as in&s;in|cerity; and what one would hope no man of candour would be active in.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018802_0016_0FA8156ADFEF5E88">It is neverthele&s;s urged by &s;ome, that he might have appealed from the judgment of the Monthly Meeting, who di&s;owned him, and have had a hearing.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, that we are very &s;en&s;ible of that, and as clearly &s;en&s;ible, that they took care to fortify them&s;elves again&s;t any appeal that he could make, unle&s;s to him who judgeth righteou&s;ly, who never <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in coun&s;el nor varied in judgment. Timothy not having had opportunity to vindicate his cau&s;e, gave his oppo&s;ers all the opportunity they could wi&s;h, to &s;pread their influ|ence through the Society, that there was no kind of rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s by appealing to a Quatterly, or Yearly Meeting, from the judgment of a Monthly Meeting, by who&s;e direction, and under who&s;e influence they acted in di&s;owning him. The idea of appealing from one, to another, by who&s;e judgment, and under who&s;e influence the fir&s;t acted, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities, and an appeal in that ca&s;e a mere empty name.</P>
<P>It is objected, that where Monthly Meetings are weak, there have been frequent in&s;tances of application being made to &s;uperior Meetings for advice, which when they have had, they have conformed to, without making any unea&s;ine&s;s in the Society.</P>
<P>An&s;wer: It is not improbable this may have been the ca&s;e; the que&s;tion is not how ea&s;ily they may have impo&s;ed on their Members in time part, but whether &s;uch impo&s;ition is capable of defence upon chri&s;tian principles. Unle&s;s the Church hath always been infal|lible in judgment, which they do not pretend, po&s;itively, to a&s;&s;ert, it will not be &s;afe to follow her advice impli|citly&mdash;no doubt it can be made very clear, that &s;he, and the members under her juri&s;diction, have made many &s;uch mi&s;takes&mdash;The thing to be con&s;idered is whether
<PB N="17" REF="018802_0017_0FA8157010FC3888">
in tho&s;e ca&s;es the intere&s;t, &s;piritual or temporal, or the reputation of any one or more of her members was concerned, and whether they were liable to be brought by appeals to &s;uch meeting as had given their advice already? If not, the ca&s;e is clear they had a right to apply there for advice. But if they were liable to be brought to &s;uch meeting, where &s;uch advice originated, and either <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> or <HI>reputation</HI> was liable to be affected, they are in danger of &s;uffering in con&s;equence of &s;uch meeting being prejudiced in favour of their former advice, when they give judgment. It is generally very hard for &s;uch meetings to recede from their former advice, le&s;t it &s;hould incur the odium of in&s;tability; e&s;pecially as they have &s;aid &s;o much of an infallible judgment in the Church; but their frequent mi&s;takes very clearly manife&s;t that they do not always make u&s;e of it, which we think is a pity, it they are really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it&mdash;It appears, we think, very clear, that &s;uch meetings ought to have &s;o tender a regard to the rights of their members, as not, &s;o far to prejudge any ca&s;e, at lea&s;t, that is liable to come before them by ap|peal, as to give their partial advice in it, but wait to have it regularly brought before them and keep them|&s;elves as clear of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That the weakne&s;s of a meeting may indeed operate again&s;t the right of the aggrieved, we have a &s;orrowful in&s;tance in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, for want of di&s;cretion or a will in Timothy Davis's Judges to do him ju&s;tice; but where this is the ca&s;e it is not likely to mend the matter by applying to a &s;uperior Meeting for advice, where it is liable to come by appeal.</P>
<P>As it appears that every di&s;putable ca&s;e in a Monthly Meeting, is liable to have its final i&s;&s;ue at the Yearly Meeting, we cannot &s;ee what ju&s;t advantage can
<PB N="18" REF="018802_0018_0FA815704DEDEEE8">
be propo&s;ed, by fir&s;t applying there for advice, unle&s;s by the con&s;ent of both &s;ides of the que&s;tion: An ad|vantage no doubt may be gained, but not a ju&s;t one. If the Ca&s;e is &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the advice of a Yearly Meeting is rendered really nece&s;&s;ary by the weakne&s;s of a Monthly Meeting or otherwi&s;e, we can think of no more ju&s;t and equitable way of proceeding, than to let it have its regular cour&s;e there by appeal, where, if they have not already given their advice or judgment in the ca&s;e, there will be &s;ome pro&s;pect of having ju&s;tice done; each party having a right to be heard; and where that right, in time pa&s;t, hath gene|rally been allowed.</P>
<P>Some have urged, that he had full liberty to vindi|cate his cau&s;e at the Monthly Meeting, when they fir&s;t took the matter under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To this we an&s;wer, it is very true that he had that liberty, and the con&s;equence of it was, he was re&s;tored to his former &s;tation in the Church by a Committee of &s;even Friends, all of their own chu&s;ing, and it is not improbable, that he would have been favoured with the like &s;ucce&s;s, if he had had an opportunity to have defended his ca&s;e through the whole proce&s;s.</P>
<P>It may not be improper here to ob&s;erve, that he had no other voice in the choice of the Committee who re&s;tored him to his former &s;tation, that a negative one, which he made u&s;e of &s;o far as to object to &s;uch as he thought di&s;qualified for that &s;ervice; which is by no means equal to a mutual choice; for tho' &s;uch a Com|mittee may con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch, as one may have no par|ticular objection to, yet there may not be any one of them &s;uch a one would have any rea&s;on to make choice of. However, as &s;canty as this liberty is, it is objected to, as being much too large: Larger they &s;ay than
<PB N="19" REF="018802_0019_0FA8157178D210F8">
what is con&s;i&s;tent with their Di&s;cipline; and that his being even pre&s;ent when the afore&s;aid Committee was appointed, was an intru&s;ion; but we mu&s;t confe&s;s it that is the ca&s;e, both we and Timothy remain &s;till in&s;en&s;ible of it.&mdash;It hath generally been the practice within the compa&s;s of this Yearly-Meeting, to allow a negative voice to the per&s;on under dealing; how arbitrary they may be in other Yearly or General Meetings we can|not pretend to &s;ay, but if it be true, that they do not admit even a negative voice in &s;imilar ca&s;es, they ought to be con&s;idered as being indeed very arbitrary, much more &s;o than can be &s;upported by civil or Chri&s;tian principles.</P>
<P>Among &s;uch objections we find one in a Letter from a Member of another Yearly Meeting to Timothy Davis, but from a tender regard to the character of the Author and his brethren, we &s;hall conceal his name, but as his letter is a little extraordinary, we &s;hall take the liberty to tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from it, which is as followeth, viz.
<Q>As far as I have under&s;tood, thou will hardly allow thy &s;elf to be properly di&s;owned, becau&s;e thy Ca&s;e was left to a Committee, cho&s;en by the Monthly Meeting, and that Committee brought it in little or no offence (as I have under&s;tood) but why &s;o, becau&s;e thou was willing from thy teeth out to condemn the publi&s;hing that Piece, which had a ten|dency to undermine and lay wa&s;te the judgment of the &s;en&s;ible part of the Body, but not to condemn the contents of it. Why &s;urely this was a very weak Committee (perhaps thy choice was al&s;o in it) which appears to have had too little regard to the &s;incerity of a member, in condemning his mi&s;conduct. It may be thou wa&s;t pre&s;ent when the Committee was cho&s;en in that monthly meeting, &s;o I was informed, and did
<PB N="20" REF="018802_0020_0FA81571B54D89D0">
object to &s;uch as would not &s;uit thy turn, if &s;o, well might thy Friends judge thy bewildered &s;tate, and that thy acknowledgment, in that part, was no more than from the teeth out; in this ca&s;e, according to the good Rules among&s;t us, thou wa&s;t a di&s;orderly per&s;on to intrude thy &s;elf in the Monthly Meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, after thy matter was brought there. Truly it was high time for Friends, of the neighbouring meetings, to a&s;&s;i&s;t that weak meeting over which by thy great influence, thou had almo&s;t over powered. And how can thou blame Friends for endeavouring to maintain the good Rules e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, let all rea&s;onable men judge in this matter.</Q></P>
<P>If by good rules he means tho&s;e by which they con|ducted this matter, his making his appeal to rea&s;onable men, we think, will rather operate again&s;t him, if the matter was to be judged by &s;uch: Men of a different character would be much likelier to favour his cau&s;e. We think it will hardly be for the reputation of the Society, or tho&s;e rules be refers to, to have them brought under the examination of Rea&s;on. His charge of in|&s;incerity is very injurious as well as unju&s;t. If his meaning can be collected from what he &s;aith, we think it mu&s;t be this, viz. Timothy's acknowledgment mu&s;t be in&s;incere, or to u&s;e his own words, from the teeth out, becau&s;e he only condemned the publication or rather the manner of it, and not the matter contained in the Piece. It is not hard to &s;ee that this conclu&s;ion is very unnatural and injudicious, for the matter of a performance may be very good, when the manner by which it is effected may be very much ami&s;s: It needs no great penetration to &s;ee this&mdash;The truth of the mat|ter is &s;trictly this: They have a Rule that requires their members, when any of them propo&s;e to publi&s;h any

thing, by means of the Pre&s;s, that they lay it before the Meeting for Sufferings, which Timothy not only neglected to do, but proceeded to publi&s;h a piece when he had received their advice to the contrary, they having by &s;ome means got intelligence of the Piece he had wrote. This is thought to be a very great Trangre&s;&s;ion; but there are &s;ome circum&s;tances attending this matter, that are a very great alleviation, viz. when he fir&s;t received the advice from them re&s;pecting the not pub|li&s;hing his piece, he expected that the leading part of the Society were that quiet, peaceable People which they have ever profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be, and that as a body they would not, at lea&s;t, intere&s;t them&s;elves in the di&s;pute between Great-Britain and the Colonies, but when he, afterward, met with &s;everal of their publications, e&s;pecially from Philadelphia, he was obliged, to his great grief, to change his &s;entiments concerning them in that re&s;pect; from tho&s;e publica|tions it appeared very clear that they intere&s;ted them|&s;elves very deeply in the &s;aid public di&s;pute, which was al&s;o farther manife&s;ted by many of them refu&s;ing to pay Taxes to the American Government; all which he con&s;idered as incon&s;i&s;tent with their former princi|ples and practice, and might involve them in much unnece&s;&s;ary Sufferings; to prevent which he was in|duced to publi&s;h the afore&s;aid Piece on Taxation, not expecting, under the&s;e circum&s;tances. to meet with any encouragement from the Meeting for Sufferings: But however, when he came fully to con&s;ider the circum|&s;tances of publi&s;hing his Piece without fir&s;t laying it before the Meeting for Sufferings, for their approba|tion, he could do no le&s;s than con&s;ider it as a mi&s;tep; for let the Society be as much out of the way as they might, he con&s;idered that it did not licence him to
<PB N="22" REF="018802_0022_0FA8157335BC1698">
commit one error to mend another, and therefore told them that he was &s;orry he had not paid more attention to the beforementioned Rule, and laid his Piece before them, before he publi&s;hed it, or words to that purpo&s;e, which they were &s;o far &s;atisfied with, that they gave him no more trouble about tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the afore&s;aid Rule, but then took in hand the matter contained in the Piece, and becau&s;e he would not condemn that, they di&s;owned him; altho' it does not appear that it contains any matter incon&s;i&s;tent with the ancient, and approved practice of the Society, from their fir&s;t appear|ance as &s;uch until very lately.</P>
<P>There appeared at that time, very different Senti|ments, both with re&s;pect to paying Taxes, and the pre&s;ent Revolution; but many that were in favour of the Revolution, when they began to feel the weight of increa&s;ing Taxes, began to exclaim again&s;t it, and continue to find much fault with the pre&s;ent Government. There remains, however, a very con&s;i|derable, as well as re&s;pectable number who continue to ju&s;tify their ancient and approved practice of paying general mixed Taxes under every change of Govern|ment, who are apprehen&s;ive that they, on the other hand, by di&s;claiming the practice of paying &s;uch Taxes, are, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions of the beforementioned Letter writer, labouring to <HI>undermine and lay wa&s;te</HI> Friends Te&s;timony in that ca&s;e, which mu&s;t involve them in much Suffering, that, to con&s;iderate people, appears very unnece&s;&s;ary, to the grief and &s;orrow of many of their mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible experienced members, who were de&s;irous of continuing and &s;upporting a practice that &s;o nearly concerned the <HI>Peace</HI> of Society, both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="018802_0023_0FA81573EC739F98">When this matter was fir&s;t taken under con&s;ideration by the Monthly Meeting, it appeared that the refu&s;ing to pay Taxes was making its way into Society with too much &s;ucce&s;s, by &s;uch who embraced that &s;entiment of refu&s;ing to pay taxes, &amp;c. who &s;oon became very active and a&s;&s;uming, and according to what hath been ob&s;erved, laboured to bear down every thing that ap|peared in favour of Timothy Davis's cau&s;e; and took the freedom to complain of intru&s;ion, tho' without cau&s;e, yet, with as much a&s;&s;urance as if their novel opinions had been received as articles of faith from their fir&s;t appearance as a religious Society.</P>
<P>We do not blame them for the &s;entiment of refu&s;ing to pay Taxes, merely becau&s;e it is new, but becau&s;e we think it an error; but &s;uppo&s;e it were true, it is very imprudent to pre&s;s it &s;o hard, &s;eeing it is new, as to di&s;own any one for publicly oppo&s;ing of it. It would be much more Chri&s;tian like to exerci&s;e a little patience until it is more generally received and e&s;tabli&s;hed. A Sentiment's being either new or old, ought never to be a rea&s;on for either receiving or rejecting it; but its being old, and generally received, demands a very clo&s;e examination and clear conviction before we part with it. A thing's being true or fal&s;e, ought to be the only rea&s;ons for which we either receive or reject it, but we doubt it is an unhappine&s;s with many, that they believe, or reject, according to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e with whom they wi&s;h to continue in favour, whether it be the Church or particular per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Timothy was &s;o far from indulging an inclination to intrude him&s;elf where he had no right, or where his right might even be &s;u&s;pected, although without any rea&s;on, that he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the meeting, who where about to appoint a Committee to hear his ca&s;e,
<PB N="24" REF="018802_0024_0FA81574A5CC1238">
in the following manner.
<Q>Friends, if my being pre|&s;ent, at the appointment of this Committee, is di&s;a|greeable I will withdraw, as I have no inclination to give unea&s;ine&s;s to any.</Q>
And received for an&s;wer, that they <HI>had no objection to his being pre&s;ent,</HI> or words to that purpo&s;e, and he was &s;en&s;ible, they could have no rea&s;onable objection: That this Letter writer's charge again&s;t him, as being an intruder, and a di&s;or|derly per&s;on for being pre&s;ent at the Meeting after his ca&s;e was brought there where the afore&s;aid Committee was appointed, is very indecent and even abu&s;ive.</P>
<P>But to proceed. After he was di&s;owned, it became a que&s;tion of importance with many judicious well-di&s;po&s;ed members, that, as he appeared to be illegally di&s;owned, whether in that ca&s;e it ought to affect his right in Society? Many of whom were determined in the negative; partly in con&s;ideration of that ju&s;t maxim which the Society formerly, when under &s;uffering, were very willing to take the advantage of, viz. That which is not legally done is not done; and partly from a con&s;ideration that their proceedings again&s;t him were without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, after he had acknowledged his fault in publi&s;hing his Piece without the con&s;ent of the Meeting for Sufferings. They were al&s;o &s;oon brought under Dealing for joining him in Prayer, as it is pre|tended to be a breach of their Rules to join with one in that duty not a member of their Church: Many of them notwith&s;tanding continued to join him for &s;ometime, who were at length terrified into a compliance with their or|ders, out of fear of being di&s;owned, and &s;ome after they had been di&s;owned on that account and continued to join him for &s;ome time, went back and made them &s;atisfaction&mdash;There were a large number di&s;owned for joining him, as above, in the duties of external wor&s;hip,
<PB N="25" REF="018802_0025_0FA815756EA139B0">
of which there &s;till remain with him a very hopeful number, among whom is Benjamin Bumpus, a man of a fair character as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t rea&s;on, they confe&s;s, that inclined them to join Timothy Davis and Benjamin Bumpus in their public devotion, was, that they thought them&s;elves fully convinced that they were divinely favoured in it, and therefore thought it not only &s;afe, but an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to join with them or any others favoured in like manner. It is a duty, that we &s;hould think every one mu&s;t acknowledge, to join with tho&s;e that we are convinced our great Lord and Ma&s;ter joins with by his &s;acred influence; nor dur&s;t many of them refu&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding the terror of being di&s;owned was often held up to them for their di&s;couragement; thinking that &s;uch rules as required &s;uch a compliance, as lays its members under a nece&s;&s;ity of acting contrary to the will of Him who only hath a right to all our obedience, ought not to be con&s;idered as binding. Many, never|thele&s;s, were, at fir&s;t, frightned into a compliance, from in&s;inuations, clo&s;ely urged by &s;ome, that could much ea&s;ier terrify weak minds than convince the wi&s;e, that what&s;oever the Church bound on Earth was bound in Heaven: Not con&s;idering that That which is acted even by the Church, if it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the will of Heaven, will never be ratified there, and that there is &s;ome room to think that her conduct, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, is not very con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Will, we think is very clear.</P>
<P>It hath been objected by &s;ome, that to join in prayer with &s;uch who are di&s;owned, is an encouragement to them to continue in a &s;tate of &s;eparation, which they wi&s;h to di&s;courage by an example of di&s;approbation.</P>

"If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembere&s;t that thy Brother hath ought again&s;t thee; leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, fir&s;t be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift." This we think is not very pertinently urged in this ca&s;e when compared with their idea of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, for they very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, that no man ought to take this gift, or honour, to him&s;elf, except he is called of God as was Aaron; or in other words of the Apo&s;tle, viz. "A nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon me, and woe is me if I preach not the Go&s;pel!" What will they do with this nece&s;&s;ity? Is it in their power to di&s;mi&s;s it when they plea&s;e?</P>
<P>We think that, tho' a brother may alledge any thing again&s;t a Mini&s;ter, if it is not a ju&s;t charge, it cannot ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed that he will be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of his nece&s;&s;ity to improve his gift, which cannot ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o pliant as to conform to an unju&s;t charge of a brother, or the partial deci&s;ion of a Church; and therefore this Text will not very well apply in this ca&s;e, unle&s;s they adopt the &s;entiment of preaching by <HI>notes,</HI> and con&s;ider <HI>them</HI> as the <HI>gift</HI> alluded to by our Saviour: This, we confe&s;s, may be left at the Altar, or any where el&s;e, at the di&s;cretion of the Preacher&punc;

<P>It may further be con&s;idered, that it is no le&s;s a <HI>breach</HI> of their <HI>rules</HI> to refu&s;e to <HI>join</HI> with one who is a <HI>member,</HI> than it is to join with one who is not; therefore as it appears that we, according to their di&s;|cipline, are not legally di&s;owned, &s;uch di&s;ownment ought not to affect our liberty, or right in the Church, they therefore by refu&s;ing to join him in prayer, have counteracted their own rules, and according to them they ought to be dealt with, and if they refu&s;e to make &s;uitable &s;atisfaction, they ought to be di&s;owned, if the matter could operate con&s;i&s;tently.</P>
<P>It is the general &s;entiment of &s;uch who are di&s;in|tere&s;ted in the di&s;pute, and who are acquainted with the circum&s;tances of their conduct and &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent revolution, that they were too much &s;harpened by political di&s;affection, which giveth the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;&s;atisfaction of any par|ticular circum&s;tance attending the pre&s;ent controver&s;y to us whom they have di&s;owned, and will remain a powerful ob&s;tacle in the way of a reconciliation, until they, properly and effectually, remove it, by acknow|ledging their error in di&s;owning of us by virtue of &s;uch influence. If it be a&s;ked how this appears? We an&s;wer, from what many of the mo&s;t active and &s;evere again&s;t us have, with much freedom, expre&s;&s;ed in con|ver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the controver&s;y between Great Britain and America, as well as from &s;everal of their publications, e&s;pecially that which they call their <HI>Antient Te&s;timony,</HI> &amp;c. before alluded to.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="018802_0029_0FA8157974A29430">There is &s;omething in their proceedings in this ca&s;e, under &s;uch influence, that &s;o very plainly and clearly di&s;covers an a&s;pect of in&s;incerity and di&s;ingenuity, when coloured over with religious preten&s;ions, that it renders a reconciliation, at lea&s;t, very difficult, if not imprac|ticable upon chri&s;tian principles, unle&s;s they retract their proceedings again&s;t us.&mdash;We, however, &s;incerely wi&s;h them well in every &s;en&s;e of the word; but cannot be free to unite with them in their pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion.

<P>Some of them &s;ay, that they &s;ee no le&s;s an attachment, in the Piece he wrote on Taxation, to the Americans.</P>

<P><PB N="30" REF="018802_0030_0FA81579F4B61848">It is objected, That if he, as well as they, was at &s;ome times actuated by political influence, why doth he fault them? Where is the difference between them in that ca&s;e?</P>
<P>An&s;wer: We have not yet granted that he was in that, or any other publick performance, actuated by political influence: But &s;uppo&s;e he was, and had been equally faulty; the be&s;t thing we can think of, would have been for them equally to have extended their charity and forbearance towards each other. In this re&s;pect there was a very wide difference between them, for it doth not appear by any means, that he had even the remote&s;t thought of withdrawing his charity from them, merely on account of their political &s;entiments, nor did he wi&s;h them to be brought under church dealing in con&s;equence of them: But they would by no means indulge his.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that they would not have taken any notice of his if he had not publi&s;hed them, which were exceedingly di&s;agreeable to Friends.</P>
<P>An&s;wer: So did they, which were no le&s;s di&s;agreea|ble to him and his Friends.

But if he had manife&s;ted him&s;elf to be as partially in favour of Ame|rica as they were in favour of Great Britain, it would have been but ju&s;t to have let one ca&s;e have been a balance for the other, with re&s;pect to any church demands. But this, it &s;eems, would not very well con&s;i&s;t with that &s;pirit of Domination that they ap|pear to be &s;o very anxious for in the church. Can it

be thought that they wi&s;hed to &s;uppre&s;s his Publication, that their's might be the more &s;ucce&s;sful?

<P>It remains a di&s;pute with &s;ome, whether Timothy was di&s;owned for the matter contained in the Piece in di&s;pute, or for &s;ome circum&s;tances attending the Publi|cation; it hath generally been thought that he was di&s;owned for both, until we received the Te&s;timony they gave forth again&s;t him, which puts the matter out of di&s;pute, by which it appears he was di&s;owned for the matter contained in the piece only, which is as followeth, viz.</P>

<P>We wi&s;h not, however, to bear hard upon any who are tenderly &s;crupulous about paying &s;uch Taxes under any Government whatever, who&s;e &s;cruples do not origi|nate in political di&s;affection, but cannot be of their &s;enti|ment in this re&s;pect, but are apprehen&s;ive that their &s;cruples ari&s;e from a want of a well informed judgment. The chief that we fault them in is, that they pre&s;s this new &s;entiment too hard upon &s;uch of their brethren as are differently minded from them&s;elves in that ca&s;e, and generally treat them with &s;hyne&s;s and di&s;re&s;pect; but have not been able to e&s;tabli&s;h a Rule in the Society that forbids paying &s;uch Taxes.</P>
<P>What their ancient, and long approved, Te&s;timony was with re&s;pect to the paying Taxes may be &s;een in the before mentioned Addre&s;s, and al&s;o in their ancient and mo&s;t approved Authors, many of whom are quoted in the &s;aid Addre&s;s, particularly George Fox, who&s;e authority with them, in general, hath been as great, at lea&s;t, as any one of their Authors. See his Book of

Epi&s;tles, p. 137,
<Q><HI>All Friends every where,</HI> who are dead to all carnal weapons, and have beaten them to pieces, &s;tand in that which takes away the occa&s;ion of Wars, which &s;aves mens lives and de&s;troys none, nor would have others;&mdash;and as for the Rulers that are to keep <HI>Peace</HI> for <HI>Peace &s;ake</HI> and for the advantage of <HI>Truth,</HI> give them their <HI>Tribute,</HI> but to bear and carry weapons to fight with the men of Peace (who live in that which takes away the occa&s;ion of Wars) they can|not act in &s;uch things <HI>under the &s;everal Powers,</HI> but have paid their <HI>Tribute,</HI> which they may do &s;till for <HI>Peace &s;ake,</HI> and not hold back the earth, but go over it, and in &s;o doing Friends may better claim their Liberty.</Q></P>
<P>He here gives two very powerful rea&s;ons for the paying of <HI>Tribute.</HI> The fir&s;t is, that it be done for the pre&s;ervation of Peace for Peace &s;ake: The &s;econd is, that in &s;o doing Friends may better claim their Li|berty. We cannot &s;ee with what confidence any can expect their Liberty pre&s;erved, who will not pay their Taxes to enable the Magi&s;trate to defend it from the hands of violence. The&s;e are rea&s;ons, one would think, that none would be weak enough to oppo&s;e&punc; Rea&s;ons no doubt, that Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles had in view when they encouraged, and enjoined, the paying of Tribute or Taxes, and al&s;o becau&s;e it was Ce&s;ar's due, but for no other rea&s;on than for his &s;ervice done, or to be done, to his Subjects; the &s;ame rea&s;ons for which Tribute or Taxes becomes due to the Govern|ment we live under, or any other civil Government.</P>
<P>If Friends will grant that it is the duty of the Magi|&s;trate to pre&s;erve Peace for Peace &s;ake, they mu&s;t al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily grant that it is his duty to &s;uppre&s;s violence, otherwi&s;e Peace will not be likely to take place.&mdash;
<PB N="35" REF="018802_0035_0FA8157E58703DA8">
How far the Magi&s;trate may act in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of violence for Peace &s;ake, perhaps is the matter in di&s;pute. George Fox, and many other Friends who have wrote &s;ince, have thought, that they might go &s;o far in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of violence, as to pay their Taxes for the Peace &s;ake, and leave it with the Magi&s;trate to pre|&s;erve it in any lawful way that he &s;hould think pro|per and mo&s;t for the benefit of the &s;ubject&mdash;The Magi&s;trates have thought, that to an&s;wer &s;o good and &s;alutary a purpo&s;e as the pre&s;erving Peace for Peace &s;ake, they ought to do all that is rea&s;onably in their power to &s;uppre&s;s all kind of violence and intru&s;ion on the Per&s;ons, Properties and Liberties of the &s;ubjects, whether committed by any of them, or by foreigners that &s;hould intrude them&s;elve</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, not any of their Writers more clear in this point than I&s;aac Pennington; nor was there &s;carcely ever an Author better approved among them in general, who, in an&s;wer to what he calls a weighty Que&s;tion, as indeed it was, concerning the Magi&s;trates protection of the innocent; in the col|lection of his Writings expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf thus, Vol. 1. p. 444.
<Q>Whether the Magi&s;trate in righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity is engaged to defend &s;uch who (by the peaceablene&s;s and love which God hath wrought in their &s;pirits and by that Law of Life, mercy, good will and forgivene&s;s which God, by his own finger hath written in their hearts) and taken off from fight|ing, and cannot u&s;e a weapon de&s;tructive to any creature?</Q>
Here followeth his an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q>Magi&s;tracy was intended by God for the defence of the people; not only of tho&s;e who have ability and can fight for them, but of &s;uch al&s;o who cannot, or are forbid by the love and law of God written in
<PB N="36" REF="018802_0036_0FA815815FC919A8">
their hearts &s;o to do. Thus Women, children, &s;ick per&s;ons, aged per&s;ons, and al&s;o Prie&s;ts in Nations (who have ability to fight, but are exempt by their function, which is not equal to the exemption which God makes by the Law of his Spirit in the heart) have the benefit of the Law, and of the Magi&s;trates protection, without fighting for the defence of either.</Q></P>
<P>Here followeth a few very pertinent ob&s;ervations by the Author of the before-mentioned Addre&s;s, viz. <HI>Now, if Magi&s;trates be appointed by God, and it be the Magi&s;trates duty to defend &s;uch, who, either are not able or cannot for con&s;cience &s;ake defend them&s;elves, is it po&s;&s;ible any can be right who lay wa&s;te this ordi|nance, or &s;peak of &s;uch defence as &s;inful? If any man be appointed by God to defend my life, is it po&s;&s;ible that God can authori&s;e me to call him a &s;inner, for doing his duty? Or is it po&s;&s;ible that I can, con&s;i&s;tent with my duty, refu&s;e him that Tribute which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enable him thus to defend me? But had I much greater abilities to &s;peak to this &s;ubject than I am con&s;cious of no rea&s;oning of mine could be of equal autho|rity with the Author above quoted; hear him therefore again, p</HI> 448, <HI>where treating on this peaceable principle profe&s;&s;ed by the Society, he &s;ays,</HI></P>
<P><Q>I &s;peak not this again&s;t any Magi&s;trate or People defending them&s;elves again&s;t foreign inva&s;ions, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> making u&s;e of the Sword to &s;uppre&s;s the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and evil doers within their own borders; <HI>for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things may and doth require,</HI> and a a great ble&s;&s;ing will attend the Sword when it is uprightly borne to that end, and its u&s;e will be honourable; and whil&s;t there is need of a Sword, the Lord will not &s;uffer the Government, or tho&s;e Governors, to want fighting in&s;truments under them,

for the management thereof, who wait on him in this fear, to have the edge of it rightly directed; but yet there is a better &s;tate, which the Lord hath already brought &s;ome into, and which Nations are to expect and to travel towards.</Q></P>
<P>That this Quotation contained the general &s;entiment of the Society at the time of its publication cannot with rea&s;on be di&s;puted, for if it had not, it is not likely they would have publi&s;hed it with a collection of his Works after his death. A further evidence of its general approbations, is the large number of Te&s;timonies of &s;ome of the mo&s;t approved Friends in the Society printed at the beginning of the collection in favour, not only of the Author, but of the Piece. And it ap|pears with no le&s;s certainty that it hath continued to be the received &s;entiment of the Society of Friends in America, by their cau&s;ing of it to be reprinted a few years ago by &s;ub&s;cription, from almo&s;t every part of the Country where there are any Friends. And there|fore it doth not appear to be either his or our particular &s;entiment, but that of the Society in general, both in Europe and America.&mdash;How tho&s;e who encouraged that Publication by their &s;ub&s;criptions, could encourage the di&s;owning Timothy Davis is very unaccountable, as there is nothing in his Piece that can, with any colour of Ju&s;tice, be con&s;trued to be any ways equally in favour of War with that Quotation, and Timothy, as well as we, think our&s;elves to be as much called from the de&s;tructive u&s;e of the Sword as they: But we have quoted that pa&s;&s;age from I&s;aac Pennington, that they may, if po&s;&s;ible, be <HI>convinced</HI> of their <HI>parti|ality</HI>&mdash;What we mean to encourage is mutual charity and forbearance to all Societies.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018802_0038_0FA81582E9805FD8">Now, for &s;uch who are called from the u&s;e of the &s;word it would no doubt be a very great &s;in for them to make a de&s;tructive u&s;e of it; who are, no doubt, de&s;igned to be lights in the World, and to hold out the Olive branch to the Nations until it &s;hall plea&s;e infinite Wi&s;dom to call the re&s;t of mankind in like manner from the u&s;e of the &s;word, when every one &s;hall &s;it quietly "under their own vine, and under their own fig-tree, and none &s;hall make them afraid. Ephraim &s;hall not envy Judah, and Judah &s;hall not vex Ephraim;" for the&s;e will have fully entered into Peace and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Glory and Perfection of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation: But till then it hath plea&s;ed God to provide for the peace and &s;afety of mankind by in&s;ti|tuting Magi&s;tracy for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, while violence and oppre&s;&s;ion remain in the earth, and the keeping peace for peace &s;ake is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>However &s;hocking &s;ome circum&s;tances which may attend the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of violence and inju&s;tice may ap|pear to tender minds, yet they ought to con&s;ider, that they are wi&s;ely ordered by the di&s;po&s;er of all events to prevent much more alarming and dreadful con&s;equences that await a &s;tate of Anarchy: We therefore can hard|ly think that any are &s;o imprudent as to wi&s;h the World to be without Law or Government, if it is not at all times, and at all places, quite as they would have it, however zealou&s;ly they may contend again&s;t the u&s;e of the &s;word in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of violence.</P>
<P>If they are in favour of continuing Magi&s;tracy for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of violence, would they not be willing to give &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward it, as to pay their Taxes, without which Magi&s;tracy cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be upheld, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to hold up the &s;word only a terror to evil-doers; when it becomes a
<PB N="39" REF="018802_0039_0FA81583B26EA500">
terror to others, it is time to take it out of their hands, and place it where it may an&s;wer the de&s;ign of its in&s;ti|tution, viz. that the Magi&s;trate may not only be a terror to evil-doers but a prai&s;e to them that do well.</P>

This objection will ea&s;ily be removed if we properly advert to the rea&s;ons there are for di|ver&s;ity and variety in the Divine Oeconomy. It appears perhaps no where more convincing than in the diver&s;ity of Gifts mentioned by the Apo&s;tle Paul, and his recom|mendation to every one to attend to their own proper gifts, otherwi&s;e they might prejudice the cau&s;e they were engaged in, and the &s;ame rea&s;ons hold good &s;till, and even in temporal matters: And altho' &s;ome may not be qualified or gifted to bear rule in the Church, yet they may be well qualified for Magi&s;trates to rule the World, if they are moral men: And it is evident from the &s;ame Apo&s;tle that we ought to be &s;ubject, and that for con&s;cience &s;ake, not only to tho&s;e Magi|&s;trates of our own Society, but to tho&s;e who do not even profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians; and the&s;e too he calls the Mini&s;ters of God to the &s;ubject for good; for they were then under the Roman govern|ment, who did not profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity: Not that we would encourage the introducing &s;uch into authority, where it can be avoided, who do not at lea&s;t profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian name.</P>

<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations it very naturally followeth, that no church ought to di&s;courage the free exerci&s;e of private judgment, nor think hard of her Members if their &s;u&s;picions are &s;ometimes awakened, e&s;pecially if they are alarmed by her adopting new &s;entiments, contrary to what &s;he hath always firmly adhered to; altho' it is po&s;&s;ible &s;uch new &s;entiments may be true, yet it is as po&s;&s;ible they may not, and therefore it be|comes the duty of the Church to wait on &s;uch di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied members with patience, perhaps they may be ble&s;&s;|ed as a means to &s;et her right if &s;he hath erred, and if not &s;he may be a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch di&s;&s;atisfied members in &s;itting them right; they may however be a mutual ble&s;&s;ing to each other if they truly &s;eek that wi&s;dom which is from above; for the promi&s;e to them that &s;eek is, <HI>that they &s;hall find:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;ee Phillip, ch. 3.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</NOTE> Remembring, as hath been ob&s;erved, that her exi&s;tence as a Church, is only as a collection of individuals, and that therefore &s;he is no longer a Church than while tho&s;e individual mem|bers which con&s;titute her, remain united; who&s;e duty it is, while thus united, by all lawful means, to pre&s;erve

that unity, that the Church may edify it&s;elf in love, either by exhorting, reproving, or encouraging, where nece&s;&s;ary This Chri&s;tian Freedom, in the Spirit of Love, manife&s;ted in go&s;pel tenderne&s;s and care for each other, is the mo&s;t likely means to pre&s;erve true unity and fellow&s;hip in a Church&mdash;Severity ought never to be extended but in wilful ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, where the peace of the church is manife&s;tly endan|gered by them, and perhaps there hath &s;eldom been more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of that nature than where reformation hath been pretended. The multiplying &s;everities in a Church hath &s;eldom been found to be of real &s;ervice: It may indeed &s;ometimes procure a &s;uperficial and &s;ervile obedience, and thereby increa&s;e her hypocrites, but will hardly effect her reformation.</P>
<P>As we are accountable to One before whom each one mu&s;t an&s;wer for him&s;elf and not another, it is highly rea&s;onable that we ought to think, judge and dige&s;t religious matters for our&s;elves, without being confined to the voice of a Church; and it is at lea&s;t equally rea&s;onable that &s;he be not confined to the voice or judgment of an individual, let his authority in the Church be as great as it may: Conviction on either &s;ide ought to be the only rea&s;on for a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Every Church hath an undoubted right to &s;ettle the Terms of its own Communion, provided neverthele&s;s, that they do not interfere with the civil or religious rights of members, or of any one el&s;e&mdash;Whenever they interfere with &s;uch rights, it becomes the duty of the civil Magi&s;trate to interfere. Every Member hath an undoubted right to di&s;&s;ent from the Church when he &s;ees rea&s;on, yet he ought not to u&s;e this liberty to his own, or the Church's di&s;advantage, in &s;uffering &s;mall things, or things of mere indifference, to be magnified

into matters of &s;eparation; but whether the matters of offence are great or &s;mall, the Church as well as her members have each their undoubted right of determination; and cannot well walk togther without chri&s;tian conde&s;cen&s;ion&mdash;But the idea that there is always an infallible judgment in the Church, which &s;ome have embraced, and that &s;he is always led by it, hath been a great hindrance to the exerci&s;e of private judgment and free enquiry, and fixed &s;ome &s;o im|moveably in a &s;tate of bigotry that they receive all from the Church, without indulging a thought of &s;eeking any further for information, that if it even comes from Heaven they dur&s;t not believe it unle&s;s the Church &s;ays it came from thence.&mdash;We ought to con|&s;ider, that a being immediately led by the Spirit of God, and a being only implicitly led by the Church, are very different things. The Primitive Chri&s;tians were not required to follow even the Apo&s;tles any farther than they followed Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>One objection that hath been very &s;trongly urged again&s;t us is, that we have applied to the Earthly Powers for the recovery of what we think to be our civil right in the Society who di&s;owned us, which they refu&s;e to give up, which we think if properly attended to the rea&s;ons for objection, in that ca&s;e, will cea&s;e. And therefore let it be con&s;idered that we made them propo&s;als of &s;ettlement of tho&s;e matters of property in di&s;pute between us and them to no purpo&s;e, they neglecting or refu&s;ing to comply with them, or to treat with us on the &s;ubject, and &s;ince have wholly refu&s;ed, even to &s;ubmit the matter to Reference, le&s;t it &s;hould embarra&s;s the Society in endle&s;s Arbitra|tions, that we &s;aw no way for redre&s;s but the Law: And to have it remain in that un&s;ettled &s;ituation was

likely to produce, as well as continue very di&s;agreeable effects, while each party claimed what the other thought they had no right to; therefore to prevent &s;uch effects, by Ju&s;tice taking place, we thought it advi&s;eable to take the mo&s;t ea&s;y way for a &s;ettlement both to them and us, which appeared to us would be to apply to the General Court. This being al&s;o con&s;i&s;tent with their own Di&s;cipline, one would have thought they would readily have complied.&mdash;They have con&s;tantly urged it as a Rule among them, that Friends <HI>do not attempt to try titles of land in di&s;pute, but that it be referred to the Law for &s;ettlement.</HI> This was the way by which we wi&s;hed it to have been &s;ettled, not with re&s;pect to the land only, but the Meeting-hou&s;es in the &s;ame di&s;putable &s;ituation; where they would have been cited in to have made their defence: But the General Court thought it more properly came under the con&s;ideration of the Judicial Department, fir&s;t advi|&s;ing to a Reference, which we have urged them to, but they, as hath been ob&s;erved, refu&s;e to comply with it.</P>
<P>It is objected that a Petition of that nature, is to them intirely new and unprecedented, and a compliance im|practicable, and therefore unrea&s;onable; and the more &s;o, as it hath been an e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule in the Society that &s;uch as are at any time di&s;owned, do not only loo&s;e their rights as Members, but al&s;o their right to any property they may have had in the Society.</P>
<P>We an&s;wer, That impo&s;&s;ibilities are neither re|quired nor expected: But will it follow, that becau&s;e length of time, or any other circum&s;tance, hath render|ed it impo&s;&s;ible to do &s;ome people &s;trict ju&s;tice, that they are ju&s;tifiable in refu&s;ing it to others in like ca&s;es where it is practicable? If they have always neglected to do ju&s;tice to their di&s;owned members until it is

impo&s;&s;ible to do &s;ome of them &s;trict ju&s;tice, will it follow that they are excu&s;able where it is in their power to do it? It is not a very good argument to &s;ay, that becau&s;e in &s;ome ca&s;es we never have done our duty, therefore, in &s;imilar ca&s;es we never ought to. Their alledging the continued practice of the Church in this ca&s;e will not help them in point of Ju&s;tice, nor add to the reputation of their Church Con&s;titution, when ju&s;tly con&s;idered, however it may have been indulged by the Law, which we hope it will be before we conclude.</P>
<P>They did not argue as they have done here in the ca&s;e of the poor in&s;laved Negroes: They have very clearly manife&s;ted the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a kind of rea|&s;oning in that ca&s;e; therefore, in confuting that kind of rea&s;oning in that ca&s;e; they have nece&s;&s;arily confuted it in all &s;imilar ca&s;es. They did not think the countenance that iniquitous practice met with from civil Authority, nor the indulgence and encouragement it met with from the Society in time pa&s;t, by any means a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to per&s;i&s;t in it. The iniquity of refu&s;ing that unhappy People Ju&s;tice in &s;o tender a point as their Liberty, is perhaps, by tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, more ea&s;ily &s;een than complied with, and it is not unlikely it may be the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, which altho' not attended with circum&s;tances equally moving, yet equally intitled to Ju&s;tice, and therefore demands a very clo&s;e attention.</P>
<P>A &s;uppo&s;ition that we have <HI>forfeited any part of our property to them, in con&s;equence of our being di&s;own|ed by them,</HI> to us appears extremely ab&s;urd; and more e&s;pecially as the di&s;ownment of us, all originated in Timothy Davis's being di&s;owned, who never had a hearing in that ca&s;e&mdash;We wi&s;h them to look at it.&mdash;

In a word, if a per&s;on be ju&s;tly intitled to the property of the Church, or any part of it, no act of theirs can ju&s;tly deprive him of it without his con&s;ent. Whenever an intere&s;t is collected, whether by the Church, or any other collective Body, tho&s;e who contributed to the collecting of it are un|doubtedly intere&s;ted in it, according to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they gave in collecting of it, unle&s;s they have be&s;towed it on that Body as a free donation: If they have, every one knoweth that they have no right of demand on that Body: But if they have not, they have a propor|tionable right to the intere&s;t they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in col|lecting, and never ought to be deprived of it but by their own con&s;ent.</P>

We think they have given cau&s;e for this and much more to have been &s;aid without ju&s;tly incurring the cen&s;ure of bitterne&s;s. But perhaps in &s;ome times of weakne&s;s, &s;omething like this charge may have been di&s;covered, which may not &s;eem very &s;trange if we allow what King Solomon remarks to have any weight, viz. that <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion will make a wi&s;e man mad.</HI> It may then be thought le&s;s &s;trange if &s;ome of us get a little out of the way in that re&s;pect. It is however what we wi&s;h not to indulge&mdash;It is diffi|cult to &s;ay what is really nece&s;&s;ary in one's vindication again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, either verbally or by writing, with|out being thought too fevere, or even bitter or acrid, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who&s;e conduct we expo&s;e&mdash;They are frequently cautioning us again&s;t being too &s;evere and bitter again&s;t them, and we wi&s;h it to have a good effect, but they &s;eem not to be under any apprehen&s;ion of erring in that re&s;pect them&s;elves: We &s;hould be glad to be convinced that they do not: We &s;hall however leave their conduct to manife&s;t what tempers and di&s;|po&s;itions they have indulged towards us in time pa&s;t, and hope they will be better in future, and hope al&s;o to pre&s;erve that di&s;po&s;ition towards them that can render good for evil, and wi&s;h well to all men, and have no rea&s;on to think but that it is the &s;entiment and wi&s;h of tho&s;e among of whom they have di&s;owned.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of the beforementioned Letter &s;igned by I&s;aac Lawton, &amp;c. they expre&s;s them&s;elves thus, viz.</P>
<P><Q>And there having been heretofore, as well as of late, happy in&s;tances of a return from your &s;ituation, we may expre&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, our de&s;ire that you may feel their example to be worthy your &s;erious con|&s;ideration and imitation; which we tru&s;t will be the ca&s;e of all &s;uch as truly &s;eek their own, and the Church's, Peace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="018802_0065_0FA8159D55580128">From this it very clearly appears how high an opinion they have of their Church, &s;o high, that they in&s;inuate that by being &s;eparated from it, we are rendered incapa|ble of &s;eeking either our own, or the Church's, Peace, until we return to her again. In this we mu&s;t take the liberty to di&s;&s;ent from them, and think that all &s;uch who truly &s;eek the peace of that univer&s;al Church which Chri&s;t hath gathered by his holy Spirit, nece&s;&s;arily &s;eek their own Peace; which we hope is at lea&s;t the ca&s;e with &s;ome of us. What examples they may be able to exhibit of any returns to them that is worthy of imi|tation we do not pretend to &s;ay; but think that &s;uch a partial fondne&s;s for, and attachment to their parti|cular Church, is much more to be lamented than imitated.&mdash;What &s;olid &s;atisfaction any one, who is truly humble, can expect to hate from a People &s;o full of them&s;elves, we mu&s;t leave, and that can &s;o ea&s;ily lay a&s;ide, or overlook the example of our Saviour and the Apo&s;tles, as well as their Predece&s;&s;ors, in the in&s;tance of paying taxes, a thing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the upholding Civil Government, divinely in&s;tituted by the Author of our being and well-being: To which examples we &s;hall take the liberty to give the pre|ference, however we may be cen&s;ured by our former Friends, or tho&s;e who have returned to them; and therefore can, by no means, with peace and &s;afety to our own minds, give &s;o much encouragement to a contrary practice and &s;entiment, as to di&s;approve that publick encouragement any of us have heretofore given to the paying taxes. Had it only been the ex|ample of their Predece&s;&s;ors that they had di&s;regarded, or mi&s;con&s;trued, much might have been &s;aid in excu&s;e for them; but that they &s;hould neglect the example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and recommend, with &s;o

much earne&s;tne&s;s, the example of &s;uch, who not pay|ing a &s;uitable attention to the before-mentioned ex|ample, have returned to them again, who were labouring to propagate a contrary practice, and to lay wa&s;te the before-mentioned example, is very extraor|dinary, and what we would wi&s;h them carefully to con&s;ider. What renders the matter &s;till peculiarly di&s;couraging is, than tho&s;e who refu&s;e to pay &s;uch taxes are generally the mo&s;t active and di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Society, which, when they become differently minded, we &s;hall, it is probable, look towards with a much more encouraging pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>They could have &s;carcely &s;ugge&s;ted any thing more injurious and prejudicial to our religious Characters in the Society than that we are not in a &s;ituation to &s;eek our own, or the Church's, Peace; nor could they ea&s;ily have di&s;covered more partiality for them&s;elves; which indeed hath been remarkably manife&s;t through the mo&s;t of their proceedings again&s;t us, as is very evi|dent from what hath been already &s;aid; who have been very indu&s;trious in labouring to foreclo&s;e and prevent us, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from rendering any public, religious &s;ervice to any of our former Brethren; many of whom appeared as ready and willing to attend our meetings for public Wor&s;hip as ever they were, but appear to be afraid of being brought under Church dealing in con&s;equence of it, and &s;haring the fate of many of their Brethren who have been di&s;owned, for no other cau&s;e than joining with us in the external acts of public Wor&s;hip&mdash;We have rea&s;on to think the more &s;trange of their conduct in this Ca&s;e when we reflect that they might have been convinced of the impropriety of &s;uch a procedure by a &s;imilar weakne&s;s that, at a certain time, di&s;covered it&s;elf among the
