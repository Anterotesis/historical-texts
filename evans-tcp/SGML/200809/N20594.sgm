<HEAD>The manner of proceeding in ca&s;es of difference.</HEAD>
<P>The party who finds he has rea&s;on of complaint, is fir&s;t him&s;elf in a calm and friendly manner to &s;peak, or, if at a di&s;tance, write to the party by whom he is injured, or in danger of &s;uffering his ju&s;t right, and endeavour by gentle means, in a brotherly manner to obtain his right; but if it is &s;till refu&s;ed, or neglected, then let him take one or two with him, either the over&s;eers, or &s;ome other judicious friends, or if they live at a di&s;tance, and belong to different meetings, write to, or empower one to act in like manner on his behalf, and in the &s;ame friend|ly way make his claim or demand, and friends &s;o accompanying the complainant, are to give their utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to have the matter ju&s;tly and expeditiou&s;ly ended, either by the parties them&s;elves, or by their im|mediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if the matter appears plain, or is an unconte&s;ted debt, or bond again&s;t which no rea&s;onable objection is made, tho&s;e friends are to advi&s;e the party complained of, to make &s;atisfaction without car|rying the matter further, either to arbitration or the meeting; but if
<PB N="5" REF="027023_0004_0FD2F7F509A1B6A8">
there is either an un&s;ettled difference in accounts, or rea&s;on of debate, then if they cannot per&s;uade the determination thereof by the parties them&s;elves, or procure it by advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they are to per|&s;uade the parties to choo&s;e &s;ome &s;uitable friends as arbitrators, and en|gage them&s;elves to &s;tand to, and abide by the determination of &s;uch re|ferrees, as is u&s;ual in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>If either of the parties refu&s;e &s;uch advice, or endeavours to end the difference, the one &s;o refu&s;ing &s;hould be complained of to the monthly meeting, and notice of &s;uch intention of complaint, that they may attend at the time appointed.</P>
<P>When the ca&s;e is brought into the meeting, the fir&s;t enquiry &s;hould be, whether the above-mentioned go&s;pel order has been duly ob&s;erved? If not, the complaint ought to be returned, and no notice taken of it on the minutes; but if it has been regularly ob&s;erved, then the meeting, to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible, contention and indecent noi&s;e, is to direct the hearing and determination thereof out of the meeting, and in order thereto, the parties may nominate each, one, or mere friends, as the im|portance of the matter may require, and the meeting add, one, or more, as they &s;ee occa&s;ion in the nature of the complaint, or for further ne|ce&s;&s;ary enquiry; and the committee &s;o nominated, are to avoid all unne|ce&s;&s;ary delays, in their determination, and make report if po&s;&s;ible to the en&s;uing monthly meeting.</P>
<P>If either party refu&s;e to attend the arbitration, and &s;ubmit their cau&s;e, and &s;tand to, and abide the award, judgment, and determination of the friends &s;o nominated and appointed, &s;uch per&s;on mu&s;t be dealt with as one di&s;orderly, who regards not peace either in him&s;elf, or in the church, and that &s;lights the love, order, and unity of the brethren; and if, after due admonition, the party per&s;i&s;t therein, let him be di&s;owned and te&s;ti|fied again&s;t by the meeting; after which the other friend may apply to the law for remedy.</P>
<P>But if any find them&s;elves aggrieved by &s;uch award, judgment, or determination, and apply to the monthly meeting for a re-hearing, be|fore the &s;aid judgment be confirmed by the meeting, let it be allowed; except in ca&s;es where bonds are entered into by the parties to abide &s;uch judgment, in which ca&s;es it ought to be final. And if the party is &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied with the judgment of the monthly meeting, and &s;hall notify

Yet it is advi&s;ed, that all coolly and weightily con&s;ider the matter, before they give the meeting &s;o much trouble, and not do it through a perver&s;e, or conten|tious temper; but only when they have good rea&s;on to believe they have ju&s;t cau&s;e &s;o to do, occa&s;ioned by want of due information to the arbi|trators, or manife&s;t mi&s;take, or error in their judgment.</P>
<P>And whereas there may be &s;ome ca&s;es wherein the foregoing method of proceeding cannot be complied with, &s;uch as the parties ab&s;cond|ing with de&s;ign to defraud their creditors, or being overloaded with debts, and other creditors generally coming on him, the claimant mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain manife&s;t damage by the time it will take in going through the meet|ings, or where there may be danger of future damage, as in ca&s;e of executors or admini&s;trators, or &s;uch as act in tru&s;t; it may therefore be nece&s;&s;ary, and it is advi&s;ed, that the monthly meetings re&s;pectively, where &s;uch ca&s;es happen, and on due enquiry appear truly &s;o, permit, or hold excu&s;ed tho&s;e who are really nece&s;&s;iated, in the two fir&s;t-mentioned ca|&s;es, to proceed otherwi&s;e: And in the ca&s;e of executors or admini&s;tra|tors, where it &s;hall appear to the meeting, that the matter is of import|ance, and that it otherwi&s;e may be un&s;afe, and manife&s;tly of dangerous con&s;equence; &s;uch may be permitted to have the matter tried at law, or rather fir&s;t in our friendly way, and then by con&s;ent confirmed by a judgment, as the meeting may &s;ee occa&s;ion upon the matter to advi&s;e and direct; with this caution, that the parties on both &s;ides concerned, &s;till appear and behave towards each other in brotherly love; and in the management of the cau&s;e, or a&s;&s;erting what they apprehend to be their right, that it be done with decency and moderation, without any pro|voking, or unbecoming language: For as a bitter indecent behaviour will cau&s;e our profe&s;&s;ion to be evilly &s;poken of, &s;o on the contrary a chri&s;tian prudence, and meek deportment, will bear a becoming te&s;timo|ny even in courts, and &s;hew that nothing but the nature of the ca&s;e, and our common &s;tation with our neighbours under the law of the na|tion, brings any of us there.</P>
<P>And as it is our duty to &s;eek peace with all men, and to avoid giving provocation, or ju&s;t offence to any, it is advi&s;ed, that friends avoid go|ing

<P N="1">1. The arbitrators &s;hould not con&s;ider them&s;elves as advocates for the party by whom they were cho&s;en; but men, who&s;e incumbent duty it is to judge righteou&s;ly.

<P N="2">2. The parties to enter into written engagements, or bonds in the u&s;ual form, if either of them require it, to abide by the award of the ar|bitrators, or a majority of them, to be made in a limited time.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every meeting of the arbitrators mu&s;t be made known to the parties concerned, until they have been fully heard; nor &s;hall there be any &s;eparate private meetings between &s;ome of the arbitrators, or with one party &s;eparate from the other on the bu&s;ine&s;s referred to them; and no repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e of one party, either by writing or otherwi&s;e, be admitted, without its being fully made known to the other, and, if required, a copy to be delivered to the other party.</P>
<P N="4">4. The arbitrators are to hear both parties fully, in the pre&s;ence of each other, whil&s;t either has any fre&s;h matter to offer, until a certain time limited, by mutual agreement. Let no evidence be withheld or rejected.</P>
<P N="5">5. If there &s;hould appear to the arbitrators, or to any of them, to be any doubtful point of law, they are jointly to agree upon a ca&s;e, and con|&s;ult council thereon. The arbitrators are not required to expre&s;s in the award their rea&s;ons for the deci&s;ion. One writing of the award is to be &s;ealed, and delivered to each party.</P>
<P>It is recommended to arbitrators to propo&s;e to the parties, that they &s;hould give an acknowledgment in writing, before the award is made, that they have been candidly and fully heard.</P>

<HEAD>CONDUCT and CONVERSATION.</HEAD>

<P>That all friends keep to the &s;implicity of truth, and our ancient te&s;ti|mony, in calling the months and days by &s;cripture names, and not by heathen. 1697.</P>
<P>We think it may be u&s;eful and expedient to revive in your remem|brance, &s;ome of the motives which induced our ancient friends to for|bear the vulgar appellations of the months and days, and to ob&s;erve in their conver&s;ations, and writings, &s;uch names as were agreeable to &s;crip|ture, and the practice of good men therein recorded.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael, the people whom God cho&s;e out of all the families of the earth, to place his name among, and to make him&s;elf known unto, were &s;trictly commanded, not only to ab&s;tain from the idolatrous practices of the nations in the mid&s;t of whom they dwelt, but were enjoined to be " circum&s;pect in all things that the Lord com|manded," and even to " make no mention of the names of other gods, neither to let it be heard out of their mouth." Exod. xxiii. 13. This injunction was not relative to any legal or typical rites, external cere|monies, or in&s;titutions of the law peculiar to the Jewi&s;h nation; but was a perpetual command, and &s;tanding ordinance, re&s;pecting the ho|nour of the one Almighty Being, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for|ever; and as &s;uch ought to be regarded by us, and by all the generati|ons of tho&s;e who with the heart believe, as well as with the tongue con|fe&s;s, " that the Lord he is God, and that there is none el&s;e be&s;ides him."

Deut iv. 35. Who hath declared, " I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my prai&s;e to graven images." I&s;aiah xlii. 8.

" I will take away the names of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word Baalim, being the plural number of Baal, &s;ignifying Lord, has relation to the names of divers idols of the heathen, wor&s;hipped in &s;everal places.</NOTE>Baalim out of his mouth, and they &s;hall no more be remembered by their names."

<P>The&s;e meetings are &s;ubordinate, and accountable to each other in the following order, viz. The preparative to the monthly, the monthly to the quarterly, and the quarterly to the yearly meeting: So that if the yearly meeting is at any time di&s;&s;atisfied with the proceedings of any of the &s;aid meetings, or the quarterly with that of the monthly, or the monthly with the preparative, within their limits, &s;uch meetings ought re&s;pectively, with readine&s;s to render a &s;atisfactory account.</P>
<P>Let each preparative meeting choo&s;e two men friends, and two wo|men friends, to attend the monthly meeting, and pre&s;ent on behalf, and by order of &s;aid preparative meeting, what &s;hall be given in charge; each monthly meeting a &s;ufficient number, to attend the quarterly meet|ing to which they belong, and pre&s;ent on behalf of the re&s;pective monthly meeting, what &s;hall be given them in charge, which ought to be in writing and for the like &s;ervice let each quarterly meeting ap|point at lea&s;t four friends of each &s;ex, as repre&s;entatives to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>Let minutes, or due entries be made in every monthly, and quarter|ly meeting, of all &s;uch matters as come before them, and are determi|ned, or that may be removed from the monthly to the quarterly, or from that to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>Let all marriages, marriage-certificates, births and burials, be record|ed in each monthly meeting; al&s;o an account of friends &s;ufferings, for their te&s;timony again&s;t hireling mini&s;ters, and war, which ought to be transferred to the quarterly, and from thence to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>If any monthly or quarterly meeting have occa&s;ion for, and reque&s;t any of the records of another monthly or quarterly meeting, it is de&s;i|red that the meeting &s;o reque&s;ting may be furni&s;hed with &s;uch copies.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="027023_0024_0FD2F8155AB835C0">That full endeavours be u&s;ed in every monthly meeting, to end, with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, all bu&s;ine&s;s that ari&s;es or is brought for their determination, and if any matter be referred from one meeting to ano|ther, let the rea&s;on be minuted why it is referred; but if they find any thing too weighty or inconvenient for them to determine, they may move it to the quarterly meeting, and after due care and endeavours to end any matter, or difference, the quarterly meeting may move it to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>The method of dealing with di&s;orderly per&s;ons, or &s;uch as give of|fence, either to the church, or particular members, is very excellently pre&s;cribed by the &s;aviour of mankind. Matthew, xviii. 15, 16, 17.
<Q>If thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault be|tween thee and him alone, if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word, may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</Q></P>
<P>The eminent apo&s;tle in his epi&s;tle to the Philippians, has the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions: Chap. iv. 8.
<Q>Finally, brethren, what&s;oever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e, think, on the&s;e things.</Q>
Now what&s;oever appears in any contrary to the&s;e, may in general, be &s;aid to come under the notice of friends, over&s;eers, and meeting. And although it is a duty incumbent on meetings, and every faithful member, where any di&s;cords, or unbecoming practices come to their knowledge, to advi&s;e, admoni&s;h, or treat with &s;uch as are guilty, yet that it may not be neglected, it ought to be, more par|ticularly and directly the bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ervice of the over&s;eers.</P>
<P>And it is advi&s;ed, that in &s;peaking to, or dealing with any, it may be done in a chri&s;tian &s;pirit of love and tenderne&s;s, by laying the evil before them, labouring in meekne&s;s to bring &s;uch to a &s;en&s;e of it in them&s;elves, that they may, if po&s;&s;ible, be re&s;tored. And although &s;uch as tran&s;gre&s;s or loo&s;e their hold of truth are apt, while in that condition, to oppo&s;e or be te&s;ty; yet we ought patiently and meekly to in&s;truct
<PB N="26" REF="027023_0025_0FD2F7B85029B200">
and advi&s;e them, &s;o that we may not only have a te&s;timony of peace in our&s;elves, but may &s;o affect the &s;pirits of tho&s;e to whom we &s;peak, as that they may be &s;en&s;ible we have performed a truly chri&s;tian duty to|wards them in brotherly love; after which tender dealing, if any reject the admonition or coun&s;el, the over&s;eers or &s;uch as deal with them, are to acquaint the preparative meeting thereof, that further care may be taken, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rule among friends.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, all other notorious crimes or gro&s;s wickedne&s;s, if any happen, the following practices ought zealou&s;ly to be taken care of and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, viz. Exce&s;&s;ive drinking, &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, lying, unlawful or un&s;eemly keeping company with women, or any other &s;candalous practices.</P>
<P>And it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the over&s;eers, or other weighty friends, to &s;peak to, or deal with &s;uch as are at difference or &s;trife, either about their intere&s;t in worldly affairs, or other re&s;entments, advi&s;ing an agree|ment among them&s;elves and &s;peedy reconciliation, to avoid if po&s;&s;ible, bringing any trouble&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to meetings which may be otherwi&s;e ended; but if they cannot prevail, they are then to take the methods pre&s;cribed for proceeding in &s;uch ca&s;e.&mdash;See conduct and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Such as frequently neglect, or do not in due time, attend meetings, tho&s;e on week-days as well as fir&s;t-days, but &s;tay away on light trivial, or ordinary occa&s;ions; a con&s;tant, or frequent neglect being a mark of declen&s;ion, and when it becomes remarkable, &s;uch &s;hould be more ear|ne&s;tly dealt with and admoni&s;hed; al&s;o, if any, old or young, when come to meeting fall a&s;leep, go out and in frequently, or otherwi&s;e dis|turb the meeting, let them be rebuked and cautioned, fir&s;t privately, and all parents, ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es ought to have a care over their children and &s;ervants in that re&s;pect, and caution them accordingly.</P>
<P>Such as keep company in order for marriage with tho&s;e not of our profe&s;&s;ion, or with any &s;ervant or apprentice without the con&s;ent of the ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s. Such as marry out of the unity of friends, or any method but the decent and orderly way u&s;ed among&s;t friends. Such as go them&s;elves, or &s;uffer their children to go to marriages con&s;umma|ted contrary to the rules of our di&s;cipline, either of tho&s;e that have profe&s;&s;ed with us, or tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, without giving a &s;atisfac|tory rea&s;on for their going, as the levity and wanton behaviour too frequently at &s;uch times, may be a means of corrupting the minds of

Such as do not keep them&s;elves and their children to moderation and plainne&s;s, in je&s;ture, &s;peech and apparel, in furniture of hou&s;es, and &s;uch things as have been cautioned again&s;t, either by the yearly meeting in London, or the yearly meeting here. Such as trade by &s;ea or land, or buy or contract beyond their abilities, and &s;uch as keep not their words or engagements in their dealing, the&s;e being a reproach to truth, and a manife&s;t injury, are to be &s;peedi|ly advi&s;ed, and if they do not amend they are further to be proceeded again&s;t. Such as run races on hor&s;e-back, or on foot, lay wages, or u&s;e any gaming, or needle&s;s and vain &s;ports and pa&s;times. Such as do not maintain our ancient chri&s;tian te&s;timonies again&s;t taking oaths, mi|litary &s;ervices, bearing arms, clande&s;tine or illicit trade, purcha&s;ing prize goods, and being concerned in lotteries of any kind. Such as are guilty of tattling, tale-bearing, reproaching, back-biting, evil|&s;peaking of their brethren or neighbours, or bu&s;ily meddling with the affairs of others, where they are not concerned; the tendency of which being to rai&s;e &s;trife and di&s;cord, or cau&s;e di&s;e&s;teem among brethren and neighbours. Such as write, print, or publi&s;h, any books or writ|ings, tending to rai&s;e contention, or occa&s;ion breach of unity, that have not fir&s;t had the approbation of &s;ome friends appointed by the yearly meeting for that purpo&s;e.

<HEAD>MINISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>MINISTERS are to be approved by the monthly meeting of which they are members, and by them recommended before they are permitted to &s;it in the meetings of mini&s;ters and elders, or to travel abroad as mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of God being the foundation of all true knowledge and experience, both in mini&s;ters and hearer, we earne&s;tly exhort that all would diligently wait upon and mind it: Mini&s;ters, in their public &s;er|vices e&s;pecially, ought always to attend clo&s;ely to their &s;everal and pe|culiar gifts, and mini&s;ter the word faithfully as it is manife&s;ted and re|vealed to them; ob&s;erving a decent and mode&s;t behaviour, in the exer|ci&s;e of their mini&s;trv, and not entangling; them&s;elves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better an&s;wer the holy warfare in which they are engaged, and let the hearers be watchful over their own &s;pirits, and not forwardly judge, or cen&s;ure the te&s;timonies which may be delivered among&s;t them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to mi&s;take in the judgment they may pa&s;s on the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the pre&s;ervation of love and concord, in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill con&s;equences, which attend a ha&s;ty and cen&s;orious judging of the mi|ni&s;try, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to caution friends not to let their own &s;pi|rits &s;way them, but let the &s;pirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will pre&s;erve all in &s;weetne&s;s, and tenderne&s;s one towards another: The due ob&s;ervance of which, will be a great help to mini&s;ters in the di&s;charge of their duty, and the &s;ervice to which they are called.</P>
<P>We further advi&s;e all monthly meetings, to take great care in giving certificates to tho&s;e who travel, to prevent the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;ome|times falls on the church, from a weak and un&s;kilful mini&s;try; and let the elders, when they &s;ee occa&s;ion, advi&s;e mini&s;ters to be very prudent in their conduct, not as bu&s;y-bodies, nor meddling with family, or per|&s;onal

affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to, nor &s;preading reports tending to rai&s;e in the minds of others a di&s;e&s;teem of any; and as &s;oon as their &s;ervice in the mini&s;try is over, that they return to their habitations, and there take a rea&s;onable and prudent care of their own bu&s;ine&s;s, hou&s;ehold, and family.</P>
<P>That there be held in each monthly meeting, a &s;elect meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, once in three months; when being met together, after &s;ome time &s;pent in &s;olid retirement, they may proceed to read and con&s;ider the queries annexed, and form general an&s;wers, to the fir&s;t, &s;e|cond and third quarterly meetings of mini&s;ters and elders; but to the quarterly meeting preceding the yearly meeting, they &s;hould all be clear|ly and di&s;tinctly an&s;wered, and as near in the words of the query as may be; that a &s;uitable number be appointed as repre&s;entatives to the quar|terly meeting, and by the quarterly meeting, to the yearly meeting of mini&s;ters and elders.</P>

<HEAD>QUERIES of the MEETING of MINISTERS and ELDERS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Are mini&s;ters and elders careful duly to attend all their meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, manife&s;ting a religious care to encourage their families in that important duty, and are they good examples in humble waiting therein, in not giving way to drow&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P N="2">II. Are mini&s;ters found in word and doctrine, careful to mini&s;ter in divine ability, and thereby kept from burthening the living?</P>
<P N="3">III. Are the lives and conver&s;ations of mini&s;ters and elders clean and blamele&s;s among&s;t men? are they in unity one with another, and the meeting they belong to, harmoniou&s;ly labouring together for truth's honour, and careful to give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to any?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Do they rule their own families well, bringing them up in plain|ne&s;s which truth requires, in dre&s;s, language, and true moderation, and are they them&s;elves good examples in tho&s;e re&s;pects?</P>
<P N="5">V. Are they peace-makers in families and in the church, not con|cerned in rai&s;ing or &s;preading evil reports, or bu&s;y-bodies where they have no proper bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="30" REF="027023_0029_0FD2F7B8E47E9338">VI. Are they careful to maintain the di&s;cipline in every part there|of, not even to hide their own families from truth's judgment, if occa|&s;ion be given, but impartially to mini&s;ter ju&s;tice, as faithful &s;ervants.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o recommended, that mini&s;ters and elders, watch over one another for good, helping tho&s;e who are exerci&s;ed in the mini&s;try in the right line; di&s;couraging forward &s;pirits that run into words without life and power; advi&s;ing again&s;t affectation of tones, ge&s;tures, and eve|ry thing that would hurt their &s;ervice; yet encouraging the humble, careful traveller, &s;peaking a word in &s;ea&s;on to them that are weary; and let all dwell in that which gives ability to labour &s;ucce&s;sfully in the church of Chri&s;t; adorning the doctrine they deliver to others; being examples to the believers, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, and in purity.</P>

<P>N. B. It is recommended that a regular record be kept of the ma|numi&s;&s;ions already executed, and of &s;uch as may hereafter be executed, for &s;laves &s;et at liberty, in a book to be provided for that purpo&s;e, by each monthly meeting, where there is occa&s;ion for &s;uch record.</P>

<Q>Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf, but &s;halt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all: neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: nor by the earth; for it is his foot&s;tool: neither by Jeru&s;alem; for it is the city of the great King.

<P>A weighty concern being revived, on con&s;ideration of the pernicious effects of the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, on the morals and health of the people of this country; although it appears on the account given, that the members of our religious &s;ociety in general, are pre&s;erved from in|temperance;

And by &s;ub&s;tituting cooling liquors in &s;tead thereof, the labourers in the field, have been enabled to perform their work with more real advantage to them&s;elves and their employers.
