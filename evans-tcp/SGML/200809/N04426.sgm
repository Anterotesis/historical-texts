<P>And the Lord &s;aid unto the Servant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my hou&s;e may be filled.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD erected this vi&s;ible world as a monument of his Glory,&mdash; a theatre for the di&s;play of his adorable perfections.&mdash;The Heavens proclaim his wi&s;dom and power in &s;hining characters, and the whole Earth is full of his goodne&s;s. Man was in his original creation excellently fitted for the &s;ervice of GOD, and for perfect happine&s;s in the enjoyment of the divine favour.</P>
<P>BUT Sin has di&s;turbed the order of nature, defaced the beauty of the creation, and involved Man, the Lord of this lower world, in the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate circum&s;tances of guilt and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE all-&s;eeing eye of GOD beheld our deplorable &s;tate; infinite pity touched the heart of the Father of mercies; and infinite wi&s;dom laid the plan of our recovery. The Maje&s;ty of heaven did not &s;ee meet to &s;uffer the Enemy of mankind, eternally to triumph in his &s;ucce&s;s; nor leave his favourite workman&s;hip, irrecoverably to peri&s;h in the ruins of the Apo&s;tacy. By a method, which at once a&s;toni&s;hes and delights the &s;ublime&s;t &s;pirits above, he opened a way
<PB N="2" REF="005471_0008_101838B019E9A2F0">
for the di&s;play of his mercy, without any violation of the &s;acred claims of his ju&s;tice; in which, the honour of the Law is vindicated, and the guilty Offender acquitted; Sin is condemned, and the Sinner eternally &s;aved. To accom|pli&s;h this ble&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, the beloved SON OF GOD a&s;&s;u|med the nature of man,&mdash; in our nature died a &s;pot|le&s;s &s;acrifice for &s;in,&mdash; by the atoning virtue of his blood he <HI>made reconciliation for iniquity,</HI> &mdash; and by his perfect obedience to the law of GOD, <HI>brought in everla&s;ting righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed his work upon Earth, before he a&s;cen|ded to his heavenly Father, he commi&s;&s;ioned the mini&s;ters of his kingdom, to <HI>preach the go&s;pel to every creature.</HI> He &s;ent them forth to make the mo&s;t exten&s;ive offers of &s;alva|tion to rebellious &s;inners, and by all the methods of holy violence to <HI>compel them to come in,</HI> and accept the invitati|ons of his grace. &mdash; We have a lively repre&s;entation of this in the <HI>Parable,</HI> in which our text is contained.</P>
<P>THE evident de&s;ign of which is, under the figure of a <HI>Marriage-Supper,</HI> to &s;et forth the plentiful provi&s;ion, which is made in our LORD JESUS CHRIST for the reception of his People, and the freedom and riches of divine grace, which invites the mo&s;t unworthy and mi&s;erable Sinners, to partake of this &s;acred Entertainment. The fir&s;t invited Gue&s;ts were the <HI>Jews,</HI> the favourite people of GOD, who were heirs of divine love, while the re&s;t of the world were <HI>Aliens from the commonwealth of I&s;rael, and &s;trangers from the covenants of promi&s;e</HI>: But the&s;e through the power of prevailing prejudice, and the influence of carnal affections, ob&s;tinately rejected the invitation, and were therefore fi|nally excluded from the&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>BUT it was not the de&s;ign of infinite wi&s;dom, that the&s;e co&s;tly preparations &s;hould be lo&s;t, and the table he had &s;pread, remain unfurni&s;hed with Gue&s;ts. Therefore he &s;ent forth his Servant <HI>into the &s;treets and lanes of the city,</HI> and commanded him to bring in <HI>the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind,</HI>&mdash;i, e. the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous and mi&s;erable of mankind;&mdash;yea, to <HI>go out into the high-ways and hedges,</HI> to the wretched and peri&s;hing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and not only invite,

<P>I AM to con&s;ider the <HI>melancholy &s;tate</HI> of the <HI>Heathen</HI> world, while in the darkne&s;s of nature, and de&s;titute of di|vine revelation. &mdash; It is ea&s;y to harangue upon the excel|lency and advantage of the <HI>light of nature.</HI> 'Tis agreea|ble to the pride of mankind, to exalt the powers of hu|man rea&s;on, and pronounce it a &s;ufficient guide to eternal happine&s;s. But let us enquire into the records of <HI>Anti|quity,</HI> let us con&s;ult the experience of all ages; and we &s;hall find that tho&s;e who had no guide but the light of nature, no in&s;tructor but una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on, have wandered in perpetual uncertainty, darkne&s;s, and error. Or let us take a view of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of tho&s;e Countries that have not been illuminated by the Go&s;pel; and we &s;hall &s;ee, that notwith&s;tanding the improvements of near &s;ix thou&s;and years, they remain to this day covered with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t darkne&s;s, and abandoned to the mo&s;t immoral and vitious practices.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005471_0010_101838B6AFECF390">The beauty and good order, every where di&s;covered in the vi&s;ible frame of nature, evidences beyond all rea&s;ona|ble di&s;pute, the exi&s;tence of an infinite and almighty Cau&s;e, who fir&s;t gave being to the Univer&s;e, and &s;till pre&s;erves it by his powerful providence. Says the Apo&s;tle to the Gen|tiles, (Rom. 1.20.) <HI>The invi&s;ible Things of GOD, from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God|head.</HI> And yet many, even among the Philo&s;ophers of the <HI>Gentile</HI> nations, impiou&s;ly denied the eternal Deity, from who&s;e hands they received their exi&s;tence; and bla&s;|phemed his infinite perfections, when &s;urrounded with the cleare&s;t demon&s;trations of his power and goodne&s;s.&mdash;Tho&s;e who acknowledged a Deity, entertained the mo&s;t unwor|thy conceptions of his nature and attributes, and wor&s;hip|ed <HI>the Creature,</HI> in the place of <HI>the Creator, who is GOD ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</HI> &mdash; Not only the illu&s;trious heroes of An|tiquity, and the public Benefactors of Mankind, but even the mo&s;t de&s;picable beings in the order of nature, were enrolled in the catalogue of their gods, and became the object of their impious adoration. <HI>They changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup|tible man, to birds and four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things,</HI> Rom. 1.23.</P>
<P>A FEW of the &s;ublime&s;t genius'<HI>s</HI> of ROME and ATHENS, had &s;ome faint di&s;coveries of the &s;piritual nature of the human <HI>Soul,</HI> and formed &s;ome probable conjectures, that man was de&s;igned for a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence. When they con&s;idered the exten&s;ive Capacities of the humane mind, and the deep impre&s;&s;ions of futurity, engraven in e|very Brea&s;t; they could not but infer, that the Soul was immortal, and at death would be tran&s;lated to &s;ome new and unknown &s;tate. When they &s;aw the Virtuous oppre&s;|&s;ed with various and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Calamities; and the vile&s;t of men triumphing in pro&s;perity and plea&s;ure; they enter|tained di&s;tant hopes, that in a future revolution, the&s;e &s;eem|ing inequalities would be rectified, the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies re|moved,&mdash;the Righteous di&s;tingui&s;hingly rewarded, and the Wicked remarkably puni&s;hed.&mdash;But after all their inquiries
<PB N="5" REF="005471_0011_101838B95A1FA710">
upon this important &s;ubject, they attained no higher, than &s;ome probable conjectures, &s;ome uncertain expectations. &mdash; And when they came to de&s;cribe the nature and &s;ituation of the&s;e invi&s;ible regions of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, they made the wilde&s;t gue&s;&s;es, and run into the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and vain imaginations. The <HI>Heaven</HI> they contrived for the enter|tainment of the virtuous, was made up of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, beneath the dignity of human nature, and incon&s;i&s;tent with perfect felicity: The <HI>Hell</HI> they de&s;cribed for the pun|i&s;hment of the vitious, con&s;i&s;ted in ridiculous terrors, unworthy the belief of a rational and religious Crea|ture.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>practices</HI> were equally corrupt with their princi|ples. As the mo&s;t extravagant errors were received among the e&s;tabli&s;hed articles of their faith, &s;o the mo&s;t in|famous vices obtained in their practice, and were indulged not only with impunity, but authori&s;ed by the &s;anction of their laws. They &s;tupidly erected altars to idols of wood and &s;tone; paid divine honours to tho&s;e, who in their lives had been the greate&s;t mon&s;ters of lu&s;t and cruelty; yea, offered up their Sons and Daughters as &s;acrifices to Devils. The principles of honour, the re&s;traints of &s;hame, the pre|cepts of their Philo&s;ophers were all too weak, to keep their corruptions within any tolerable bounds. The wickedne&s;s of their hearts broke through every inclo&s;ure, and deluged the Earth with rapine and violence, blood and &s;laughter, and all manner of bruti&s;h and dete&s;table impurities.&mdash;It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to read the melancholy de&s;cription of the principles and manners of the heathen world, given us by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> without horror and &s;urpri&s;e. To think, that man once the <HI>friend of GOD,</HI> and <HI>the Lord of this lower world,</HI> &s;hould thus <HI>deny the GOD that made him,</HI> and bow down to <HI>dumb idols</HI>; &s;hould thus by lu&s;t and intemperance, degrade him&s;elf into the character of the <HI>Bea&s;t, which hath no un|der&s;tanding</HI>; and by pride, malice, and revenge, transform him&s;elf into the very image of the <HI>Devil, who was a mur|derer from the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the &s;tate of the <HI>gentile</HI> nations, when the light of the Go&s;pel appeared, to &s;catter the darkne&s;s that over|&s;pread
<PB N="6" REF="005471_0012_101838BDD56A4108">
the face of the Earth. And this has been the ca&s;e, &s;o far as has yet appeared, of all the nations ever &s;ince, upon whom the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>has not aro&s;e with healing in his wings.</HI> Every new-di&s;covered Country opens a new &s;cene of a&s;toni&s;hing ignorance and barbarity; and gives us fre&s;h evidence of the univer&s;al corruption of human nature.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCEED now to con&s;ider the <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate Care</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER towards mankind, in the&s;e their deplorable circum&s;tances. He <HI>&s;ends out his Servants,</HI> to invite them <HI>to come in,</HI> and accept the enter|tainments of <HI>his hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>GOD might have left his guilty creatures, to have eter|nally &s;uffered the di&s;mal effects of their apo&s;tacy, without the lea&s;t imputation of inju&s;tice, or violence of his infinite perfections. The fall was the con&s;equence of man's cri|minal choice, and attended with the highe&s;t aggravations. &mdash;The <HI>Angels that &s;inned,</HI> were made examples of GOD's righteous &s;everity, and are re&s;erved <HI>in chains</HI> of guilt <HI>to the Judgment of the great day.</HI> Mercy, that tender, attribute of the divine nature, did not interpo&s;e in their behalf, to &s;u&s;pend the execution of their &s;entence, or avert GOD's threatned di&s;plea&s;ure: their puni&s;hment is, unalterably decreed, their Judgment is irrever&s;ible; they are the awful monuments of revenging wrath, and are con|demned <HI>to blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever.</HI>&mdash; Now Ju&s;tice might have &s;hewn the &s;ame inflexible &s;everity to rebellious man, and have left the univer&s;al progeny of <HI>Adam,</HI> to peri&s;h in their guilt and mi&s;ery. It was unmerited mercy, that di&s;tingui&s;hed the human race, in providing a Saviour for us; and the mo&s;t &s;ignal compa&s;&s;ion that revealed the coun&s;els of heaven for our recovery.</P>
<P>BUT though Ju&s;tice did not oblige the divine Being to provide for our relief, yet the Goodne&s;s of the indulgent Father of the univer&s;e inclined him to &s;hew pity to his guilty Creatures, who fell from their innocence, through the &s;ubtilty and malice of &s;educing and apo&s;tate Spirits.
<PB N="7" REF="005471_0013_101838BFCF1294E0">
It was agreeable to the divine wi&s;dom, to di&s;appoint the devices of Satan, the enemy of GOD and Goodne&s;s, and recover the creatures he had made, from their &s;ubjection to the powers of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE therefore gave early di&s;coveries of his de&s;igns of mer|cy to our fir&s;t Parents, and immediately upon the apo&s;tacy opened a door of hope for their recovery. He revealed a SAVIOUR to the antient Patriarchs, under dark types, and by di&s;tant promi&s;es; made clearer declarations of his will, as the appointed time drew near, for the accom|pli&s;hment of the promi&s;es, and the manife&s;tation of the Son of GOD in human fle&s;h.&mdash; <HI>And when the fulne&s;s of time was come, GOD &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>THIS divine and illu&s;trious Per&s;on left the bo&s;om of his Father, that he might put on the Character of a &s;ervant; &mdash; de&s;cended from the glories of heaven, that he might dwell on this inferior earth;&mdash; was made under the law, that he might fulfill all righteou&s;ne&s;s;&mdash; &s;ubmitted to the infirmities of human nature, to the &s;orrows and &s;ufferings of an afflicted life, and to the agonies of a painful igno|minious death on a cro&s;s, that he might de&s;troy the power of &s;in, aboli&s;h the empire of death, and purcha&s;e immortality and glory for peri&s;hing Man.</P>
<P>WHILE our LORD JESUS re&s;ided in this lower world, he preached the glad tidings of &s;alvation, and publi&s;hed the kingdom of GOD; confirming his doctrine by nume|rous and undoubted miracles, and recommending his in&s;truc|tions by the charms of a &s;potle&s;s life and conver&s;ation. He &s;ent forth his Apo&s;tles to pur&s;ue the &s;ame gracious de&s;ign of go&s;pelli&s;ing the people, and furni&s;hed them with &s;ufficient powers to pro&s;elyte the nations to the faith. He al&s;o appointed a &s;tanding mini&s;try, to carry on a treaty of peace with rebellious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ners, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages of the Church; to continue, till the number of the re|deeem'd is completed, and the whole <HI>election of grace</HI> placed in circum&s;tances of &s;potle&s;s purity and perfect hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005471_0014_101838C4CE9A3090">THESE mini&s;ters are &s;tyled <HI>the Servants of CHRIST,</HI> by way of eminence: They are in a peculiar manner devoted to the Service of their divine ma&s;ter; from him they re|ceive their commi&s;&s;ion; by him they are appointed to repre&s;ent his per&s;on, pre&s;ide in his wor&s;hip, and teach the laws of his Kingdom.&mdash; To a&s;&s;ume this character without being divinely called, and regularly introduced into this &s;acred office, is a bold inva&s;ion of CHRIST's royal autho|rity, and an open violation of that order, which he has e|&s;tabli&s;hed in his Church.&mdash; The&s;e not only derive their mi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST, but it is <HI>his doctrine</HI> they are to preach, and not the inventions of their own brain:&mdash;it is <HI>his glory</HI> they are to promote, and not their own intere&s;t or honor:&mdash;their bu&s;ine&s;s is not to propagate the de&s;igns of a party, but <HI>the common &s;alvation,</HI> and to <HI>be&s;eech</HI> all, <HI>in CHRIST's name, to be reconciled unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tles, the primitive heralds of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, were &s;ent to make the fir&s;t Tender of &s;alvation to <HI>the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of</HI> ISRAEL; they were comman|ded to begin at JERUSALEM, the centre of the Jewi&s;h Commonwealth: But when the Jews ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in their impenitence and unbelief, they were commi&s;&s;i|oned <HI>to preach the go&s;pel to every Creature under hea|ven:</HI>&mdash; The &s;inners of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were invited to <HI>come in,</HI> and accept of the offers of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THE Prophets pointed out a <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was to come, and proclaimed the joyful approach of a Redeemer, at the time appointed in the &s;overeign coun&s;els of heaven. The mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel now are &s;ent to declare, that the prophecies are accompli&s;hed, the promi&s;e fulfilled, ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, &s;alvation purcha&s;ed; and all that will <HI>come in,</HI> &s;hall receive the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel. They are not only freely to invite Sinners, of all orders and degrees, of all ages and nations; but to a&s;&s;ure them, that <HI>all things are now ready,</HI> and to u&s;e the mo&s;t powerful and per&s;ua&s;ive methods, that they may engage them to comply with the heavenly Call.&mdash; Which brings me to the third thing propo&s;ed.</P>

<P>I AM next to &s;hew, that it is the great duty of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the go&s;pel <HI>to compel &s;inners to come in,</HI> and accept of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; This is &s;o plain|ly contained in my text, that I &s;hall not multiply argu|ments to confirm it. My only bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be to ex|plain the nature of this compul&s;ion, or &s;hew in what manner &s;inners are to be <HI>compelled to come in</HI> to the Chri|&s;tian Church.&mdash; And &s;ure I am, I mu&s;t an&s;wer, negatively, not by the deceitful methods of fraud and di&s;gui&s;e, &mdash; nor the inhuman practices of per&s;ecution and violence. This text indeed has often been alledged by the <HI>per&s;ecu|ting bigots</HI> of all ages, and apply'd to &s;upport the cau&s;e of <HI>religious tyranny</HI>; to the infinite &s;candal of the chri&s;|tian name, and the un&s;peakable detriment of the chri&s;ti|an intere&s;t. &mdash; By this means the Enemies of our mo&s;t holy faith have been &s;trengthen'd in their infidelity, the weak have been turned a&s;ide from <HI>the truth, as it is in JESUS,</HI> and the peaceable kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah tran&s;|formed into a field of blood,&mdash;a &s;cene of helli&s;h and hor|rid cruelties. If this were the <HI>compul&s;ion</HI> recommended in the go&s;pel, then ab&s;olute unrelenting tyrants would be the proper and mo&s;t infallible teachers; then racks and tor|tures would be the genuine and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful method of propagating the faith. But &s;urely every thing of this kind, every violent and driving mea&s;ure, is in direct op|po&s;ition to the precepts and example of our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our, and contrary to the very genius of his go&s;pel, &mdash; which proclaims, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14.</NOTE> <HI>Glory to GOD in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, good-will towards men</HI></P>
<P>THE Princes of this world exerci&s;e a temporal domi|nion over mankind, and by fines levied on their e&s;tates and puni&s;hments inflicted upon their bodies, force men to an outward &s;ubjection to their authority and govern|ment.&mdash; But the kingdom of our Lord is of a &s;piritual

nature: He erects his empire in the hearts of men, and reigns ever <HI>a willing people in the day of his power.</HI> Ex|ternal violence may nece&s;&s;itate men to an external profe&s;|&s;ion of the truth, and procure a di&s;&s;embled compliance with the in&s;titutions of CHRIST; but can never enligh|ten the darkne&s;s of the mind, conquer the rebellion of the will, nor &s;anctify and &s;ave the &s;oul. It may transfigure men into accompli&s;h'd hypocrites; but will never convert them into real &s;aints.</P>
<P>THE Go&s;pel was originally propagated by the power|ful preaching of CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles, by the a&s;ton|i&s;hing miracles which they wrought in confirmation of their doctrine, and the exemplary lives by which they a|dorned their profe&s;&s;ion and character. In&s;tead of propa|gating their religion by the de&s;tructive methods of fire and &s;word, they &s;ubmitted to the rage and cruelty of a ma|lignant world with &s;urpri&s;ing patience, and &s;acrificed their very lives in the cau&s;e of GOD, without any intemperate di&s;coveries of anger and re&s;entment:&mdash; in&s;tead of calling for <HI>fire from heaven</HI> to de&s;troy their oppo&s;ers, they com|pa&s;&s;ionated their ignorance, in&s;tructed them with <HI>meekne&s;s,</HI> coun&s;el'd and exhorted them with <HI>all long-&s;uffering and doctrine,</HI> and even &s;pent their dying breath in praying for their conviction and conver&s;ion, that they might be &s;aved in the day of the LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>Now in imitation of the&s;e primitive Doctors of the chri&s;tian church, the&s;e wi&s;e and &s;ucce&s;sful preachers of the Go&s;pel, it is the duty of the mini&s;ters of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> day, to u&s;e the &s;ame methods of compa&s;&s;ion and friendly vio|lence. A di&s;intere&s;ted zeal for the glory of God, a &s;ted|fa&s;t adherence to the truth, and un&s;haken fidelity in our Ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, with univer&s;al benevolence to mankind, mu&s;t con&s;tantly animate our public di&s;cour&s;es, and be con|&s;picuous in our private conver&s;ation and behaviour. &mdash; We mu&s;t diligently indeavour to convince the under&s;tan|dings, engage the affections, and direct the practice of our hearers.&mdash;Upon this head, it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;cend to a few particulars.</P>

<P>AND for your encouragement, I will only add,&mdash;When I con&s;ider the many prophecies, in &s;acred &s;cripture, of the triumphant progre&s;s of the go&s;pel in the la&s;t ages of the world, I cannot but <HI>lift up</HI> my <HI>head with joy</HI> in an humble expectation, that the <HI>day draws near,</HI> yea, is <HI>even at hand,</HI> when the promi&s;es made to the Son of God &s;hall be more illu&s;triou&s;ly fulfilled: &mdash; <HI>When he &s;hall have the heathen for his inheritance, amd the utmo&s;t ends of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &mdash; When his name &s;hall be great among the gen|tiles, and be</HI> honoured and adored <HI>from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un to the going down of the &s;ame.</HI>&mdash; But if the appoint|ed time is not yet come, and the attempts made to intro|duce this glorious day, fail of de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;<HI>your judg|ment will be with the Lord, and your Reward with your God.</HI> If the gentiles <HI>be not gathered</HI> in; you will <HI>be glo|rious in the eyes of the Lord,</HI> who accepts and rewards his &s;ervants according to the &s;incerity of their de&s;ires, and not according to the &s;ucce&s;s of their endeavours.</P>

<P>GOD our Saviour, in infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion, hath <HI>&s;ent his &s;ervants</HI> to invite you to <HI>come in,</HI> and receive the ble&s;|&s;ings, which infinite wi&s;dom has contrived, and a&s;toni&s;hing grace prepared, for your entertainment.

<P>G&Ograve;D has been plea&s;ed to employ us the me&s;&s;engers of his grace, <HI>Men of like pa&s;&s;ions</HI> with your&s;elves, &s;ubject to the common infirmities of human nature: But the me&s;|&s;age comes from Him, who is KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS; whom you are under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to hear and obey, in point of intere&s;t, gratitude, and duty.</P>
<P>WHAT gracious and conde&s;cending methods has he taken, to allure and invite you! Has he not de&s;cended from heaven to earth; from the boundle&s;s glories of eter|nity, to all the &s;ufferings and afflictions of this mortal life, that he might purcha&s;e and reveal &s;alvation; that he might engage your love, and per&s;wade you to comply with his &s;aving de&s;igns!

<P>WHAT excu&s;es have you to make, that will &s;tand the trial of an enlightned con&s;cience, or ju&s;tify you at the awful tribunal of God?

<P>ARE there any honours comparable to the dignity and character of a child of God, &mdash; a title to the privileges of his hou&s;e and family?

<P>THE deplorable, peri&s;hing State of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the&s;e Parts of <HI>America,</HI> being by &s;everal Mini&s;ters here repre&s;ented to the <HI>Society in</HI> Scotland <HI>for propagating Chri&s;tian Knowledge</HI>; the &s;aid Society cha|ritably and chearfully came into the Propo&s;al of main|taining <HI>two Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> among the&s;e mi&s;erable Pagans, to endeavour their Conver&s;ion <HI>from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD</HI>: and &s;ent their Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome Mini&s;ters and other Gentlemen here, to act as their <HI>Corre&s;pondents,</HI> in providing, di|recting, and in&s;pecting the &s;aid Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Corre&s;pondents were authorized by the Society's Commi&s;&s;ion, they immediately looked out for two Candidates of the evangelical Mini&s;try, who&s;e Zeal for the Intere&s;ts of the REDEEMER's Kingdom, and who&s;e Compa&s;&s;ion for poor peri&s;hing Souls, would prompt them to &s;uch an exceeding difficult and &s;elf-denying Un|dertaking. &mdash; They fir&s;t prevail'd with Mr. <HI>Azariah Hor|ton</HI> to relinqui&s;h a Call to an encouraging Pari&s;h, and to

<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you are plea&s;ed to require of me &s;ome brief and general Account of my Conduct in the Affair of my Mi&s;&s;ion among&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI>; the Pains and En|deavours I have u&s;ed to propagate <HI>Chri&s;tian Knowledge</HI> a|mong them; the Difficulties I have met with in Pur&s;u|ance of that great Work; and the hopeful and encoura|ging Appearances I have ob&s;erved in any of them: I &s;hall now endeavour to an&s;wer your Demands, by giving a brief
<PB N="25" REF="005471_0031_101838FF0139DF90">
but faithful Account of the mo&s;t material Things relating to that important Affair, with which I have been, and am &s;till concerned. And this I &s;hall do with more Freedom, and Chearfulne&s;s, both becau&s;e I apprehend it will be a likely Means to give pious Per&s;ons, who are concern'd for the Kingdom of CHRIST, &s;ome ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of the many and great Difficulties, that attend the Propaga|tion of it among&s;t the poor Pagans, and con&s;equently 'tis hopeful, will engage their more frequent and fervent Pray|ers to God, that tho&s;e may be &s;ucceeded, who are em|ploy'd in this arduous Work: And al&s;o becau&s;e I per&s;uade my &s;elf that the Tidings of the Go&s;pel's &s;preading a|mong the poor Heathen, will be, to tho&s;e who are wait|ing for the Accompli&s;hment of the <HI>Glorious Things &s;poken of the City of our God,</HI> as <HI>good News from a far Country:</HI> And that <HI>the&s;e</HI> will be &s;o far from <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing the Day of &s;mall Things,</HI> that on the contrary the lea&s;t Dawn of Encou|ragement and Hope, in this important Affair, will rather in&s;pire their pious Brea&s;ts with more generous and warm De&s;ires, that <HI>the Kingdoms of this World,</HI> may &s;peedily <HI>be|come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore immediately proceed to the Bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore me, and briefly touch upon the mo&s;t important Mat|ters, that have concern'd my Mi&s;&s;ion, from the Beginning to this pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P>On <HI>March</HI> 15, 1743. I waited on the Corre&s;pondents for the <HI>Indian</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion at <HI>New-York</HI>; and the Week fol|lowing, attended their Meeting at <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in <HI>New-Jer|&s;ey,</HI> and was &s;peedily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by them with Orders to at|tempt the In&s;truction of a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in a Place &s;ome Miles di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Albany.</HI> And on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>April</HI> following, I arrived among the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a Place call'd by them <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> in the County of <HI>Albany,</HI> near about twenty Miles di&s;tant from the City Ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>The Place, as to its Situation, was &s;ufficiently lone&s;ome, and unplea&s;ant, being incompa&s;&s;ed with Mountains, and Woods; twenty Miles di&s;tant from any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabi|tants;
<PB N="26" REF="005471_0032_101839008D3FEC08">
&s;ix, or &s;even from any <HI>Dutch</HI>; and more than two from a Family that came, &s;ome Time &s;ince, from the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had then liv'd (as I remem|ber) about two Years in this Wilderne&s;s. In this Family I lodg'd about the Space of three Months, the Ma&s;ter of it being the only Per&s;on with whom I could readily con|ver&s;e in tho&s;e Parts, except my Interpreter; others under|&s;tanding very little <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>After I had &s;pent about three Months in this Situation, I found my Di&s;tance from the <HI>Indians</HI> a very great Di&s;|advantage to my Work among&s;t them, and very burden|&s;ome to my &s;elf; as I was oblig'd to travel forward and backward almo&s;t daily on Foot, having no Pa&s;ture in which I could keep my Hor&s;e for that Purpo&s;e. And after all my Pains, could not be with the <HI>Indians</HI> in the E|vening and Morning, which were u&s;ually the be&s;t Hours to find them at home, and when they could be&s;t attend my In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>I therefore re&s;olv'd to remove, and live with or near the <HI>Indians,</HI> that I might watch all Opportunities, when they were generally at Home, and take the Advantage of &s;uch Sea&s;ons for their In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Accordingly I removed &s;oon after; and, for a Time, liv'd with them in one of their <HI>Wigwams</HI>: and not long after, built me a &s;mall Hou&s;e, where I &s;pent the Remain|der of that Year intirely alone; my Interpreter (who was an <HI>Indian</HI>) choo&s;ing rather to live in a Wigwam among his own Country-Men.</P>
<P>This Way of living I found attended with many Diffi|culties, and uncomfortable Circum&s;tances, in a Place where I could get none of the Nece&s;&s;aries and common Com|forts of Life (no, not &s;o much as a Mor&s;el of Bread) but what I brought from Places fifteen and twenty Miles di&s;|tant, and oftentimes was oblig'd, for &s;ome Time together to content my &s;elf without, for Want of an Opportunity to procure the Things I needed.</P>
<P>But although the Difficulties of this &s;olitary Way of li|ving are not the lea&s;t, or mo&s;t incon&s;iderable, (and doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="005471_0033_1018390294C42D68">
are in Fact many more and greater to tho&s;e who <HI>ex|perience,</HI> than they can readily <HI>appear</HI> to tho&s;e, who only view them at a Di&s;tance) yet I can truly &s;ay, that the Burden I felt re&s;pecting my <HI>great Work</HI> among the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> the Fear and Concern that continually hung up|on my Spirit, le&s;t they &s;hould be prejudic'd again&s;t Chri|&s;tianity, and their Minds imbitter'd again&s;t me, and my Labours among them, by Means of the In&s;inuations of &s;ome who (although they are call'd <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) &s;eem to have no Concern for CHRIST's <HI>Kingdom,</HI> but had rather (as their Conduct plainly di&s;covers) that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould remain Heathens, that they may with the more Ea&s;e cheat, and &s;o inrich them&s;elves by them; The Burden, I &s;ay, the Fear, and Concern I felt in the&s;e Re|&s;pects were much more pre&s;&s;ing to me, than all the Difficulties that attended the Circum&s;tances of my liv|ing.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Temper of Mind,</HI> in which I found the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> at my fir&s;t coming among them, I may ju&s;t|ly &s;ay, it was much more de&s;ireable, and encouraging, than what appears among tho&s;e who are altogether un|cultivated. Their Heatheni&s;h Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picion and their Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, were in a great Mea&s;ure remov'd by the long continued Labours of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant</HI> among a Number of the &s;ame Tribe, in a Place little more than twenty Miles di&s;tant: by which Means the&s;e were, in &s;ome good Degree, prepar'd to entertain the Truths of Chri&s;tianity, in&s;tead of object|ing again&s;t them, and appearing almo&s;t intirely untracta|ble, as is common with them at fir&s;t and as per|haps the&s;e appear'd a few Years ago. Some of them, at lea&s;t, appear'd very well di&s;pos'd toward Religion, and &s;eem'd much pleas'd with my coming among them.</P>
<P>In my Labours with them, in Order <HI>to turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light,</HI> I &s;tudied what was mo&s;t <HI>plain,</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> and be&s;t &s;uited to their Capacities: and endeavour'd to &s;et before them from Time to Time (as they were a|ble
<PB N="28" REF="005471_0034_1018390749726948">
to receive them) the mo&s;t <HI>important,</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Truths of Chri&s;tianity; &s;uch as mo&s;t immediately con|cern'd their &s;peedy Conver&s;ion to God, and &s;uch as I judg'd had the greate&s;t Tendency (as means) to effect that glorious Change in them. But e&s;pecially I made it the <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Drift</HI> of all my Labours, to lead them into a thorow Acquaintance with the&s;e two Things. &mdash; Fir&s;t, the <HI>Sinfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> of the E&s;tate they were <HI>natural|ly</HI> in: The Evil of their Hearts, the Pollution of their Natures: The heavy Guilt they were under, and their Expo&s;edne&s;s to everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment; as al&s;o their ut|ter Inability to &s;ave them&s;elves, either from their Sins, or from tho&s;e Mi&s;eries which are the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of them; and their Unworthine&s;s of any Mercy at the Hand of God, on Account of any Thing they them|&s;elves could do to procure his Favour, and con&s;equently their extreme Need of CHRIST to &s;ave them. &mdash; And, Secondly, I frequently endeavoured to open to them the <HI>Fulne&s;s, Al&s;ufficiency,</HI> and <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of that <HI>Redemption,</HI> which the SON of GOD has wrought out by his Obedi|ence and Sufferings, for peri&s;hing Sinners: How this Pro|vi&s;ion he had made, was &s;uited to all their Wants; and how he call'd and invited them to accept of everla&s;ting Life freely, notwith&s;tanding all their Sinfulne&s;s, Inability, Unworthine&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I had been with the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;everal Months, I compos'd &s;undry <HI>Forms of Prayer,</HI> adapted to their Cir|cum&s;tances and Capacities; which with the Help of my Interpreter, I tran&s;lated into the <HI>Indian</HI> Language; and &s;oon learn'd to pronounce their Words &s;o as to pray with them in their own Tongue. I al&s;o tran&s;lated &s;undry <HI>P&s;alms</HI> into their Language, and &s;oon after we were able to &s;ing in the Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>When my People had gained &s;ome Acquaintance with many of the Truths of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o that they were capable of receiving, and under&s;tanding many others, which at fir&s;t could not be taught them, by Rea&s;on of their Ignorance of tho&s;e that were nece&s;&s;ary to be previ|viou&s;ly
<PB N="29" REF="005471_0035_1018390C07A19148">
known, and upon which others depended; I then gave them an <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> Account of God's Dealings with his ancient profe&s;&s;ing People, the <HI>Jews</HI>: Some of the Rites, and Ceremonies, they were obliged to ob&s;erve, as their Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And what the&s;e were de&s;ign'd to repre&s;ent to them: As al&s;o &s;ome of the &s;urprizing Mi|racles God wrought for their Salvation, while they tru&s;t|ed in him, and the &s;ore Puni&s;hments he &s;ometimes bro't upon them, when they for&s;ook and &s;inn'd again&s;t him. Afterwards I proceeded to give them a Relation of the Birth, Life, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, and Re&s;ur|rection of CHRIST: as well as his A&s;cen&s;ion, and the wonderful Effu&s;ion of the Holy SPIRIT con&s;equent thereupon.</P>
<P>And having thus endeavour'd to prepare the Way by &s;uch a general Account of Things, I next proceeded to read, and <HI>expound</HI> to them the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> (at lea&s;t the Sub&s;tance of it) in Cour&s;e, wherein they had a more di&s;tinct, and particular View of what they had be|fore &s;ome general Notion of.</P>
<P>The&s;e Expo&s;itions I attended almo&s;t every <HI>Evening,</HI> when there was any con&s;iderable Number of them at Home; except when I was obliged to be ab&s;ent my &s;elf, in Order to learn the <HI>Indian</HI> Language with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant.</HI>&mdash; Be&s;ides the&s;e Means of In&s;truction, there was likewi&s;e an <HI>Engli&s;h School</HI> con&s;tantly kept by my In|terpreter among the <HI>Indians</HI>: which I us'd frequently to vi&s;it, in Order to give the Children and young People &s;ome proper In&s;tructions, and &s;erious Exhortations &s;uited to their Age.</P>
<P>The Degree of <HI>Knowledge</HI> to which &s;ome of them at|tain'd, was con&s;iderable. Many of the Truths of Chri|&s;tianity &s;eem'd fix'd in their Minds, (e&s;pecially in &s;ome In&s;tances,) &s;o that they would &s;peak to me of them, and a&s;k &s;uch Que&s;tions about them, as were nece&s;&s;ary to render them more plain and clear to their Under&s;tand|ings.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="005471_0036_1018390F31DBDAE0">The Children al&s;o, and young People, who attended the <HI>School,</HI> made con&s;iderable Proficiency (at lea&s;t &s;ome of them) in their Learning; &s;o that had they under&s;tood the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language well, they would have been able to read &s;omewhat readily in a <HI>P&s;alter.</HI></P>
<P>But that which was mo&s;t of all de&s;irable, and gave me the greate&s;t Encouragement amid&s;t many Difficulties and di&s;con&s;olate Hours, was, that the Truths of God's Word &s;eem'd, at Times, to be attended with &s;ome <HI>Power</HI> upon the Hearts and Con&s;ciences of the <HI>Indians.</HI> And e&s;peci|ally this appeared evident in a few In&s;tances, who were awaken'd to &s;ome Sen&s;e of their mi&s;erable E&s;tate by Na|ture, and appear'd &s;olicitous for Deliverance from it. Several of them came, of their own Accord, to di&s;cour&s;e with me about their Soul's Concerns; and &s;ome, with Tears, enquired <HI>what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved?</HI> And whether the GOD that Chri&s;tians &s;erv'd, would be merciful to tho&s;e that had been frequently drunk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And although I can't &s;ay, I have &s;atisfactory Evidences of their being <HI>renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</HI> and &s;avingly converted to God, yet the Spirit of God did (I apprehend) in &s;uch a Manner attend the Means of Grace, and &s;o operate upon their Minds thereby, as might ju&s;tly afford Matter of Encouragement to hope, that God de&s;ign|ed Good to them, and that he was preparing his Way in|to their Souls.</P>
<P>There likewi&s;e appeared a <HI>Reformation</HI> in the Lives and Manners of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Their idolatrous <HI>Sacrifices</HI> (of which there was but one or two, that I know of, after my coming among them) were wholly laid a&s;ide. And their Heatheni&s;h Cu&s;tom of <HI>Dancing, Halloeing,</HI> &amp;c. they &s;eem'd in a con&s;iderable Mea&s;ure broken off from. And I could not but hope, that they were reform'd in &s;ome Mea&s;ure from the Sin of <HI>Drunkenne&s;s.</HI> They likewi&s;e manife&s;ted a Regard to the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>: And not only behav'd &s;oberly them|&s;elves,
<PB N="31" REF="005471_0037_10183910C4AA4E30">
but took Care al&s;o to keep their <HI>Children</HI> in Or|der.</P>
<P>Yet after all I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that as there were many hope|ful Appearances among them, &s;o there were &s;ome Things more <HI>di&s;couraging.</HI> And while I rejoic'd to ob&s;erve any Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and Concern among them about the Affairs of their Souls, &s;till I was not without continual Fear and Concern, le&s;t &s;uch encouraging Appearances might prove <HI>like a Morning-Cloud, that pa&s;&s;eth a|way.</HI></P>
<P>When I had &s;pent near a Year with the <HI>Indians,</HI> I in|form'd them that I expected to leave them in the Spring then approaching, and to be &s;ent to another Tribe of <HI>In|dians,</HI> at a great Di&s;tance from them: Upon hearing of which they appear'd very &s;orrowful, and &s;ome of them endeavour'd to per&s;wade me to continue with them; urg|ing that they had now heard &s;o much about their <HI>Souls Concerns,</HI> that they could never more be willing to live as they had done, without a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> and further In&s;tructi|ons in the Way to Heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereupon I told them, they ought to be willing that others al&s;o &s;hould hear about their Soul's Concerns, &s;eeing tho&s;e needed it as much as them&s;elves. Yet further to di&s;&s;uade me from going, they added, that tho&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom I had Thoughts of going (as they had heard) were not willing to become <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as <HI>they</HI> were, and therefore urged me to tarry with them. I then told them, that <HI>they</HI> might receive further In&s;truction without me; but the <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom I expected to be &s;ent, could not, there being no Mini&s;ter near to teach them. And hereupon I advi&s;ed them, in Ca&s;e I &s;hould leave them, and be &s;ent otherwhere, to remove to <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> where they might be &s;upplied with Land, and Conveniences of Living, and be under the Mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant</HI>: Which Advice, and Propo&s;al, they &s;eem'd di&s;po&s;ed to comply with.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005471_0038_101839146FA49FF0">On <HI>April</HI> 6, 1744. I was order'd and directed by the Corre&s;pondents for the <HI>Indian</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion, to take Leave of the People, with whom I had then &s;pent a full Year, and to go (as &s;oon as conveniently I could) to a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Delaware</HI>-River in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Orders I &s;oon attended, and on <HI>April</HI> 29th took Leave of my People, who were mo&s;tly remov'd to <HI>Stockbridge</HI> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant.</HI> I then &s;et out on my Journey toward <HI>Delaware</HI>; and on <HI>May</HI> tenth, met with a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in a Place called <HI>Minni&s;&s;inks,</HI> about an hundred and forty Miles from <HI>Kau|naumeek</HI> (the Place where I &s;pent the la&s;t Year) and di|rectly in my Way to <HI>Delaware</HI>-River. With the&s;e <HI>Indi|ans</HI> I &s;pent &s;ome Time, and fir&s;t addre&s;s'd their <HI>King</HI> in a friendly Manner; and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, and At|tempts to contract a Friend&s;hip with him, I told him I had a De&s;ire (for his Benefit and Happine&s;s) to in&s;truct them in <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> At which he laugh'd, turn'd his Back upon me, and went away. I then addre&s;s'd another <HI>Principal</HI> Man in the &s;ame Manner, who &s;aid he was wil|ling to hear me. After &s;ome Time, I follow'd the <HI>King</HI> into his Hou&s;e, and renew'd my Di&s;cour&s;e to him: but he declin'd talking, and left the Affair to another, who appeared to be a rational Man. He began, and talked very warmly near a Quarter of an Hour together: he en|quired why I de&s;ir'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to become <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;eeing the Chri&s;tians were &s;o much wor&s;e than the <HI>Indians</HI> are in their pre&s;ent State. The Chri&s;tians, he &s;aid, would lie, &s;teal, and drink, wor&s;e than the <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Twas <HI>they</HI> fir&s;t taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to be drunk: And <HI>they</HI> &s;tole from one another, to that Degree, that their Rulers were obli|ged to hang them for it, and that was not &s;ufficient to de|ter others from the like Practice. But the <HI>Indians,</HI> he added, were none of them ever hang'd for Stealing, and yet they did not &s;teal half &s;o much; and he &s;uppos'd that if the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould become Chri&s;tians, they would then be as bad as the&s;e. And hereupon he &s;aid, they would live as their <HI>Fathers</HI> liv'd, and go where their <HI>Fathers</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="005471_0039_10183919CDCB7A98">
were when they died. I then freely <HI>owned, lamented,</HI> and join'd with him in <HI>condemning</HI> the ill Conduct of &s;ome, who are called <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>: told him, the&s;e were not <HI>Chri&s;|tians</HI> in <HI>Heart</HI>; that I hated &s;uch wicked Practices, and did not de&s;ire the <HI>Indians</HI> to become &s;uch as the&s;e.&mdash;And when he appear'd calmer, I a&s;k'd him if he was willing, that I &s;hould come and &s;ee them again: he replied, he &s;hould be willing to &s;ee me again: as a <HI>Friend,</HI> if I would not de&s;ire 'em to become <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI>&mdash;I then bid them farewell, and pro&s;ecuted my Journey toward <HI>Delaware.</HI> And <HI>May</HI> 13th I arrived at a Place called by the Indians, <HI>Sakhauwotung,</HI> within the Forks of <HI>Delaware</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Here al&s;o, when I came to the <HI>Indians,</HI> I &s;aluted their <HI>King,</HI> and others, in a Manner I thought mo&s;t engaging. And &s;oon after informed the <HI>King</HI> of my De&s;ire to in&s;truct them in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> After he had con&s;ulted a few Minutes with two or three old Men, he told me, he was willing to hear. I then preach'd to tho&s;e few that were pre&s;ent: who appear'd very attentive, and well-di&s;po|&s;ed. And the <HI>King</HI> in particular &s;eemed both to wonder, and at the &s;ame Time to be well pleas'd with what I taught them, re&s;pecting the DIVINE BEING, &amp;c. And &s;ince that Time he has ever &s;hewn him&s;elf friendly to me, giving me free Liberty to preach in his Hou&s;e, whenever I think fit.&mdash;Here therefore I have &s;pent the greater Part of the Summer pa&s;t, preaching u&s;ually in the <HI>King</HI>'s Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Place, is but &s;mall: mo&s;t of tho&s;e that formerly belong'd here, are di&s;pers'd, and remov'd to Places farther back in the Country. There are not more than ten Hou&s;es hereabouts, that continue to be inhabited; and &s;ome of the&s;e are &s;everal Miles di&s;|tant from others, which makes it difficult for the <HI>Indians</HI> to meet together &s;o frequently as could be de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t began to preach here, the Number of my <HI>Hearers</HI> was very &s;mall; often not exceeding twenty or twenty-five Per&s;ons: But towards the latter Part of the Summer, their Number increas'd, &s;o that I have frequently had forty Per&s;ons, or more at once: and oftentimes the
<PB N="34" REF="005471_0040_1018391B64A5CA48">
mo&s;t of tho&s;e belonging to tho&s;e Parts, came together to hear me preach.</P>
<P>The <HI>Effects</HI> which the Truths of God's Word have had upon &s;ome of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Place, are &s;omewhat encouraging. Sundry of them are brought to renounce <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and to decline partaking of tho&s;e <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> which they u&s;ed to offer in Sacrifice to certain &s;uppo&s;ed unknown Powers. And &s;ome few In&s;tances among them have, for a con&s;iderable Time, manife&s;t|ed a &s;erious Concern for their Soul's eternal Welfare, and &s;till continue to <HI>enquire the Way to Zion,</HI> with &s;uch Di|ligence, Affection, and becoming Solicitude, as gives me Rea&s;on to hope, that <HI>God who</HI> (I tru&s;t) <HI>has begun this Work in them,</HI> will carry it on, until it &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in their &s;aving Conver&s;ion to him&s;elf. The&s;e not only dete&s;t their old idolatrous Notions, but &s;trive al&s;o to bring their Friends off from them. And as they are &s;eeking Salvation for their own Souls, &s;o they &s;eem de&s;irous, and &s;ome of them take Pains, that others might be excited to do the like.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> la&s;t I heard of a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> re&s;iding at a Place (call'd <HI>Kauk&s;&eacute;&s;auchung</HI>) more than thirty Miles We&s;tward from the Place where I u&s;ually preach. I vi|&s;ited them, found about thirty Per&s;ons, and propo&s;ed my De&s;ire of preaching to them: they readily comply'd, and I preach'd them only twice; they being ju&s;t then remo|ving from this Place (where they only liv'd for the pre|&s;ent) to <HI>Su&s;quahannah</HI>-River where they belong'd.</P>
<P>While I was preaching, they appear'd &s;ober, and atten|tive; and were &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd, having never before heard of the&s;e Things. There were two or three, who &s;u&s;pected that I had &s;ome ill De&s;ign upon them; and urg'd, that the <HI>white</HI> People had abus'd them, and taken their Lands from them, and therefore they had no Rea&s;on to think that they were now concern'd for their Happi|ne&s;s: But on the contrary, that they de&s;ign'd to make them Slaves, or get them on board their Ve&s;&s;els, and make them fight with the People over the Water (as they ex|pre&s;s'd it) meaning the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> However,
<PB N="35" REF="005471_0041_1018391FB0B285B0">
the mo&s;t of them appear'd very friendly, and told me, they were then going directly home to <HI>Su&s;quahannah,</HI> and de&s;ired I would make them a Vi&s;it there, and manife&s;ted a con&s;iderable De&s;ire of farther In&s;truction.</P>
<P>This Invitation gave me &s;ome Encouragement in my great Work; and made me hope, that God de&s;ign'd to <HI>open an effectual Door to me</HI> for &s;preading the Go&s;pel a|mong the poor Heathen farther We&s;tward.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, with the Advice and Direction of the Corre&s;pondents for the <HI>Indian Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> I undertook a Journey to <HI>Su&s;quahannah.</HI> And after three Days tedious Travel, two of them thro' a Wilderne&s;s al|mo&s;t unpa&s;&s;able by Rea&s;on of Mountains and Rocks, and two Nights lodging in the open Wilderne&s;s, I came to an <HI>Indian</HI> Settlement on the Side of <HI>Su&s;quahan|nah</HI>-River, call'd <HI>Opeholhaupung</HI>: where were twelve Indi|an Hou&s;es, and (as nigh as I could learn) about &s;eventy Souls, old and young, belonging to them.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o, &s;oon after my Arrival, I vi&s;ited the <HI>King,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him with Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s: and after a few Words of Friend&s;hip, inform'd him of my De&s;ire to teach them the Knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> He he&s;itated not long before he told me, that he was willing to hear. I then preached, and continu'd there &s;everal Days, preaching every Day, as long as the <HI>Indians</HI> were at Home. And they in order to hear me, deferr'd the De&s;ign of their ge|neral Hunting (which they were ju&s;t then entering upon) for the Space of three or four Days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Men,</HI> I think, univer&s;ally (except one) attended my Preaching. Only, the <HI>Women,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing the Affair we were upon was of a publick Nature, belonging only to the Men, and not what every individual Per&s;on &s;hould concern him&s;elf with, could not readily be per&s;uaded to come and hear: but, after much Pains u&s;ed with them for that Purpo&s;e, &s;ome few ventured to come, and &s;tand at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>When I had preach'd to the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;everal Times, &s;ome of them very frankly propo&s;ed what they had to ob|ject
<PB N="36" REF="005471_0042_101839248C80B2E8">
again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; and &s;o gave me a fair Opportu|nity for u&s;ing my be&s;t Endeavours to remove from their Minds tho&s;e Scruples and Jealou&s;ies they laboured under: And when I had endeavour'd to an&s;wer their Objections, &s;ome appeared much &s;atisfied. I then a&s;ked the <HI>King</HI> if he was willing I &s;hould vi&s;it, and preach to them again, if I &s;hould live to the next Spring: He replied, he &s;hould be heartily willing for his own Part, and added, he wi&s;h'd the young People would learn <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I then put the &s;ame Que&s;tion to the re&s;t: Some an&s;wered, they &s;hould be very glad, and none manife&s;ted any di&s;like to it.</P>
<P>There were &s;undry other Things in their Behaviour, which appeared with a comfortable, and encouraging A&s;|pect; that, upon the whole, I could not but rejoice I had taken that Journey among them, altho' it was at|tended with many Difficulties and Hard&s;hips. The Me|thod I u&s;ed with them, and the In&s;tructions I gave them (I am per&s;uaded) were Means in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to re|move their heatheni&s;h Jealou&s;ies, and Prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity: And I could not but hope, <HI>the God of all Grace</HI> was preparing their Minds to receive <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us.</HI> If this may be the happy Con&s;equence, I &s;hall not only rejoice in my pa&s;t Labours and Fatigues; but &s;hall, I tru&s;t, al&s;o <HI>be willing to &s;pend and be &s;pend,</HI> if I may thereby be in&s;trumental <HI>to turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> I have given you a faithful Account of what has been mo&s;t con&s;iderable re&s;pecting my Mi&s;&s;ion a|mong the <HI>Indians</HI>; in which I have &s;tudied all convenient Brevity. I &s;hall only now take leave to add a Word or two re&s;pecting the <HI>Difficulties</HI> that attend the Chri&s;tiani|zing of the&s;e poor Pagans.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, Their Minds are fill'd with <HI>Prejudices</HI> again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> on Account of the <HI>vicious</HI> Lives and <HI>un|chri&s;tian</HI> Behaviour of &s;ome that are call'd <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> The&s;e not only &s;et before them the wor&s;t Examples, but &s;ome of them take Pains, expre&s;ly in Words, to di&s;&s;uade them from becoming Chri&s;tians; fore&s;eeing, that if the&s;e &s;hould be
<PB N="37" REF="005471_0043_10183926DF98EDA0">
converted to God, <HI>the Hope of their</HI> unlawful <HI>Gain</HI> would thereby be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, The&s;e poor Heathens are extremely attach'd to the Cu&s;toms, Traditions and fabulous Notions of their <HI>Fa|thers.</HI> And this one &s;eems to be the Foundation of all their other Notions, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>'twas not the &s;ame GOD made them, who made the White People,</HI> but another who commanded them to live by <HI>Hunting,</HI> &amp;c. and not conform to the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>white</HI> People.&mdash; Hence when they are de&s;ir'd to become Chri&s;tians, they frequent|ly reply, that <HI>they will live as their Fathers liv'd, and go to their Fathers, when they die.</HI> And if the <HI>Miracles</HI> of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles be mentioned, to prove the Truth of Chri&s;tianity; They al&s;o mention &s;undry Miracles, which their Fathers have told them were anciently wro't among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and which Satan makes them believe were &s;o.&mdash;They are much attach'd to <HI>Idolatry</HI>: Frequent|ly making <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> which they eat in Honour to &s;ome <HI>un|known</HI> Beings, who, they &s;uppo&s;e, &s;peak to them in <HI>Dreams</HI>; promi&s;ing them Succe&s;s in Hunting, and other Affairs, in Ca&s;e they will &s;acrifice to them. They oftentimes al&s;o offer their Sacrifices to the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>Dead</HI>; who, they &s;uppo&s;e, &s;tand in Need of Favours from the Living, and yet are in &s;uch a State as that they can well reward all the Offices of Kindne&s;s that are &s;hewn them. And they impute all their Calamities to the Neglect of the&s;e Sa|crifices.</P>
<P>Furthermore, they are much awed by tho&s;e among them&s;elves, who are call'd <HI>Powwaws,</HI> who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a Power of Inchanting, or poy&s;oning them to Death, or at lea&s;t in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Manner. And they apprehend it would be their &s;ad Fate to be thus inchanted, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould become Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The <HI>Manner of their living</HI> is likewi&s;e a great Di&s;advantage to the De&s;ign of their being Chri&s;tianized. They are almo&s;t continually roving from Place to Place; and 'tis but rare, that an Opportunity can be had with &s;ome of them for their In&s;truction. There is &s;carce

<P>As to the <HI>Hard&s;hips</HI> that nece&s;&s;arily attend a Mi&s;&s;ion among them, the Fatigues of frequent Journeying in the Wilderne&s;s, the Unplea&s;antne&s;s of a mean and hard Way of Living, and the great Difficulty of addre&s;&s;ing <HI>a People of a &s;trange Language,</HI> the&s;e I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent, pa&s;s over in Silence; de&s;igning what I have already &s;aid of Difficulties attending this Work, not for the Di&s;couragement of <HI>any,</HI> but rather for the Incitement of <HI>all,</HI> who <HI>live the Appear|ing and Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> to frequent the Throne of Grace with earne&s;t Supplications, that the <HI>Heathen,</HI> who were anciently <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to Chri&s;t <HI>for his Inheritance,</HI> may now <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>&s;peedily</HI> be brought into his Kingdom of Grace, and made Heirs of immortal Glory. &mdash;</P>
