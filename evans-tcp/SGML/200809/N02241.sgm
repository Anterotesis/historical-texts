I remember, that in the Vi&s;ions of the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> we read, Rev. VIII 10. <HI>A great &s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e upon the foun|tains of Waters; and the name of the &s;tar is cal|led, Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the waters becau&s;e they were made bitter.</HI> The <HI>bitter Servitude</HI> wherein to many Provinces of the Roman Empire were brought, when the <HI>Goths</HI> made their De&s;cent from the North upon it, may be thus pointed out unto us.

<P>CONCERNING this Young Gentleman, I have &s;een this Account given by a Credible Per&s;on, that was Intimately Acquainted with him.</P>
<Q><P>AS he was a Young Man of a Beauti|ful Countenance; of an Hail and Firm Con&s;titution of Body, which enabled him to act with much Vigour, and under|go the Hard&s;hips of the War; So he was of a Plea&s;ant and Spritely Witt; of a Sweet Di&s;po&s;ition; Of a Free and Gene|rous Temper; Mode&s;t and Ba&s;hful in his Behaviour, Full of Life; and full of Love to every One: Of &s;o Conde&s;cending a Spirit, that it &s;ometimes drew him into Inconveniences: Obedient and Re&s;pectful to his Superiors; Kind to all; Far from In&s;ulting over his Inferiors; which gain|ed him great Re&s;pect from tho&s;e that were Acquainted with him; and e&s;pecially of the Souldiers that were under him; He was &s;o far from taking any Advantage, that in their Streights and Difficulties, he has given &s;ometimes to Poor Fellows

that were in Nece&s;&s;ity the Cloathes off his Back, to &s;upply them: Which, to|gether with his Forwardne&s;s on all Acti|ons greatly endeared him to them, and cau&s;ed him to be much Lamented by them.</P></Q>
<P>THE reach of the Mortal <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e</HI> at this Young Gentleman, is now to be Related: But one mu&s;t feel <GAP DESC="foreign"> as was of old &s;aid, <HI>Not one &s;ingle, Commotion of Soul, but a whole A&s;&s;embly of Pa&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ns,</HI> moved at &s;uch a Relation.

<P>BEING left at <HI>Georges</HI> Fort, in command of the Garri&s;on there, on the Thirtieth of <HI>April,</HI> 1724.

Here they lay un|di&s;covered by ours, as ours were by them, until they put off in their Boats from the I&s;land. After they had come &s;ome Di&s;tance

from the I&s;land, Capt. <HI>Win&s;low</HI> being in the foremo&s;t Boat, and Sergeant <HI>Harvy</HI> in the other, there came a Flock of Fowl within Shot of <HI>Harvy'</HI>s, at which one of the Men Imprudently made a Shot, and knock'd down a Fowl in the Water. <HI>Harvy</HI> turning to take up the <HI>Fowl,</HI> Capt. <HI>Win&s;low</HI> advi&s;ed him, that it was be&s;t he &s;hould not follow the Fowl, but that they &s;hould keep together; for, &s;aid he, <HI>We know not what we may meet with, before we reach the Fort.

Heart could not bear to leave them in their Di&s;tre&s;s; but immediately put about his Boat, that he might ha&s;ten to their Succour. Before he could get near them, he found him&s;elf Surrounded with between Thirty and Forty Canoes; whereof &s;everal had four or &s;ix Men a piece aboard; which came off from both &s;ides of the River, and attack'd him with great Fury. They &s;et up an hide|ous Yelling &amp; Howling, expecting thereby &s;o to have daunted them, as to have taken our &s;mall Handful without much Re&s;i&s;tance: But in this their expectation failed them; for Capt. <HI>Win&s;low</HI> and his Brave Handful, notwith&s;tanding the Horror of their Ap|proach, and tho' &s;o out-numbered, and like to be Over-powered, by &s;uch a Multitude of the <HI>Dragons of the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> made ready to give them a warm Reception.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the <HI>general Condolence</HI> with You, upon the Sorrow, which You have lately met withal, I take a very Particular <HI>Share,</HI> and think it my&punc; Duty to give you &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of it.</P>

<P>IF not a <HI>Bird of the Air</HI> falls to the <HI>Earth</HI> with|out the Will of our Heavenly Father; You may be &s;ure that the <HI>Child</HI> Hatch'd under your tender Wing, is not fallen without the Will of Heaven Ordering of it.

<P>IT is a great <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> that you are now put upon. But You will approve your&s;elves the Genuine Children of <HI>Abraham:</HI> And &s;o prove Your Claim to the Ble&s;&s;ings of His <HI>Covenant,</HI> if you overcome the <HI>Reluctancles of Nature</HI> to it.&mdash;<HI>Withhold not</HI> the <HI>Child</HI> whom Thou ha&s;t <HI>Loved,</HI> When GOD calls you to offer it up.

<P>A <HI>Trial,</HI> yea, an exqui&s;ite one, is now made, whether there be any thing, which at the plain Call of GOD you cannot re&s;ign unto Him? or, whether you will not now Seek and Hope to find that <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in having a Glorious CHRIST Concerned for You, and Conver&s;ing with You,
