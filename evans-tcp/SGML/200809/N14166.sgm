<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN religious matters we ea&s;ily run into ex|tremes. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee people embracing one error, under the plau|&s;ible pretence of avoiding another.</P>
<P>Many, through fear of infidelity, during the night of ignorance and &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion, run again&s;t the wild rocks of &s;uper&s;tition and enthu|&s;ia&s;m; and frequently do it with &s;uch force, that they <HI>make &s;hipwreck of the faith,</HI> and have little of <HI>godline&s;s</HI> left, except a few broken pieces of its <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>Numbers, to &s;hun that fatal error, &s;teer quite a contrary cour&s;e: Suppo&s;ing them&s;elves guided by the compa&s;s of rea&s;on, when they only fol|low that of prejudice, with equal violence they da&s;h their &s;peculative brains again&s;t the oppo&s;ite rocks of dei&s;m and profanene&s;s; and fondly con|gratulate them&s;elves on e&s;caping the &s;helves of fanatici&s;m, whil&s;t the leaky bark of their hopes is ready to &s;ink, and that of their morals is per|haps &s;unk already. Thus, both equally over|look &s;ober, rational, heart-felt piety, that lies between tho&s;e wide and dangerous extremes.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="017930_0008_0FA37E357809B018">To point out the happy medium which they have mi&s;&s;ed, and call them back to the narrow path, where Rea&s;on and Revelation walk hand in hand, is the de&s;ign of the&s;e &s;heets. May <HI>the Father of lights</HI> &s;o &s;hine upon the Reader's mind, that he may clearly di&s;cover truth, and notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everity of her a&s;pect, prefer her to the mo&s;t &s;oothing error!</P>
<P>If he is one of tho&s;e, who affect to be the warm votaries of Rea&s;on, he is intreated to be a <HI>clo&s;e</HI>-thinker, as well as a <HI>free</HI>-thinker; and with carefull attention to con&s;ider Rea&s;on's dic|tates, before he concludes, that they agree with his favourite &s;entiments. He has, no doubt, too much candour, not to grant &s;o equitable a reque&s;t; too much ju&s;tice, to &s;et a&s;ide <HI>Matter of fact</HI>; and too much good &s;en&s;e, to di&s;regard <HI>an Appeal to common &s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Should he incline to the oppo&s;ite extreme, and cry down our rational powers; he is de&s;ired to remember, <HI>Right Rea&s;on,</HI> which is that I ap|peal to, is a ray of <HI>the light that enlightens every man who comes into the world,</HI> and a beam of the eternal <HI>Logos,</HI> the glorious <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>God, far from blaming a proper u&s;e of the noble faculty, by which we are chiefly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from brutes, graciou&s;ly invites us to the exerci&s;e of it: <HI>Come now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and let us rea|&s;on together.</HI> Je&s;us <HI>commends the unju&s;t &s;teward,</HI> for rea&s;oning better upon his wrong, than the children of light, upon their right principles. Samuel de&s;ires the I&s;raelites to <HI>&s;tand &s;till, that he may</HI> REASON <HI>with them before the Lord.</HI> St. Pe|ter charges believers to <HI>give an an&s;wer to every
<PB N="xi" REF="017930_0009_0FA37E36B2D35270">
one, that a&s;keth them a</HI> REASON <HI>of their hope.</HI> And St. Paul, who <HI>rea&s;oned</HI> &s;o conclu&s;ively him|&s;elf, intimates, that <HI>wicked men are</HI> UNREA|SONABLE; and declares, that a total dedication of our&s;elves to God is <HI>our</HI> REASONABLE <HI>&s;ervice:</HI> And, while he challenges the vain <HI>di&s;puters of this world,</HI> who would make je&s;ts pa&s;s for proofs, invectives for arguments, and &s;ophi&s;try for rea|&s;on; he charges Titus to u&s;e, not merely <HI>&s;ound &s;peech,</HI> but, as the original al&s;o means, SOUND REASON, <HI>that he who is of the contrary part may be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then, following his advice and exam|ple, pay a due regard both to rea&s;on and revela|tion: So &s;hall we, according to his candid di|rection, break the &s;hackles of prejudice, <HI>prove all things; and,</HI> by divine grace, <HI>hold fa&s;t that which is good.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN APPEAL TO MATTER OF FACT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<P>IN every religion there is a principal truth or error, which, like the fir&s;t link of a chain, nece&s;&s;arily draws after it all the parts, with which it is e&s;&s;entially connected. This leading principle, in Chri&s;tianity di&s;tingui&s;hed from De|i&s;m, is the Doctrine of our corrupt and lo&s;t e&s;tate: for if man is not <HI>at variance</HI> with his Creator, what need of a <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and him? If he is not a <HI>depraved, undone</HI> crea|ture, what nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o wonderful a <HI>Re&s;torer</HI> and <HI>Saviour</HI> as the Son of God? If he is not <HI>in|&s;laved</HI> to &s;in, why is he <HI>redeemed</HI> by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If he is not <HI>polluted,</HI> why mu&s;t he be <HI>wa&s;hed in the blood of</HI> that immaculate <HI>Lamb?</HI> If his &s;oul is not <HI>di&s;ordered,</HI> what occa&s;ion is there for &s;uch
<PB N="14" REF="017930_0011_0FA37E37BAA9D280">
a divine <HI>Phy&s;ician?</HI> If he is not <HI>helple&s;s</HI> and <HI>mi|&s;erable,</HI> why is he perpetually invited to &s;ecure the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> and <HI>con&s;olations</HI> of the Holy Spirit? And, in a word, if he is not <HI>born in &s;in,</HI> why is a <HI>new birth</HI> &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that Chri&s;t declares with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, <HI>without it no man can &s;ee the kingdom of God?</HI></P>
<P>This doctrine then being of &s;uch importance, that genuine Chri&s;tianity &s;tands or falls with it; it may be proper to &s;tate it at large; and as this cannot be done in &s;tronger or plainer words, than tho&s;e of the &s;acred writers, and our pious reformers; I beg leave to collect them, and pre|&s;ent the reader with a picture of our natural e&s;tate, drawn at full length by tho&s;e antient and ma&s;terly hands.</P>
<P N="1">I. Mo&s;es, who informs us, that <HI>God created man in his own image, and after his likene&s;s,</HI> &s;oon ca&s;ts a &s;hade upon his original dignity, by giving us a &s;ad account of his fall. He repre&s;ents him after his di&s;obedience, as a criminal under &s;en|tence of death; a wretch filled with guilt, &s;hame, dread and horror; and a vagabond, turned out of a lo&s;t paradi&s;e into a <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> wil|derne&s;s, where all bears the &s;tamp of de&s;olation for his &s;ake. Gen. iii. 17. In con&s;equence of this apo&s;tacy he died, and <HI>all die in him: for, by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned</HI> in him, who was all mankind &s;eminally and federally collected in one individual. 1 Cor. xi. 22. Rom. v. 12.</P>
<P>The &s;acred hi&s;torian, having informed us how the fir&s;t man was corrupted, ob&s;erves, that <HI>he be|gat a &s;on in his own image,</HI> &s;inful and mortal like him&s;elf; that his fir&s;t-born was a murderer;
<PB N="15" REF="017930_0012_0FA37E3878A582B8">
that Abel him&s;elf offered &s;acrifices to avert divine wrath, and that the violent temper of Cain &s;oon broke out in all the human &s;pecies. <HI>The earth,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>was filled with violence&mdash;all fle&s;h had cor|rupted its way&mdash;and God &s;aw the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth,</HI> &s;o great, <HI>that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil, continually.</HI> ONLY <HI>evil,</HI> without any mix|ture of good: And CONTINUALLY, without any intermi&s;&s;ion of evil. Gen. vi. 5.</P>
<P>When the deluge was over, the Lord him&s;elf gave the &s;ame account of his ob&s;tinately rebelli|ous creature. <HI>The imagination of man's heart,</HI> &s;aid he to Noah, <HI>is evil from his youth,</HI> Gen. viii. 21. Job's friends paint us with the &s;ame colours: One of them ob&s;erves, that <HI>Man it born like the wild a&s;&s;es' colt:</HI> And another, that <HI>he is abo|minable and filthy, and drinks iniquity like water.</HI> Job xi. 12. and xv. 16.</P>
<P>David doth not alter the hideous portrait: <HI>The Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>looked down from heaven upon the children of men; to &s;ee if there were any, that did under&s;tand, and &s;eek God.</HI> And the re&s;ult of the divine in&s;pection is: <HI>They are all gone a&s;ide, they are all together become filthy: There is none that doth good, no not one.</HI> P&s;. xiv. 2. Solomon gives a fini&s;hing &s;troke to his father's draught, by in|forming us, that <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s is bound in the heart of a child,</HI> and not of a child only, for he adds, <HI>The heart of the &s;ons of men is full of evil, and while they live, madne&s;s is in their heart.</HI> Prov. xxii. 15. Eccl. ix. 3.</P>
<P>I&s;aiah corroborates the a&s;&s;ertions of the royal Prophets, in the following mournful confe&s;&s;ions: <HI>All we, like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray&mdash;We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy rags.</HI> I&s;a. liii. 6. and&punc; lxiv. 6.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017930_0013_0FA37E393AEBA9F8">Jeremiah confirms the deplorable truth, where he &s;ays: <HI>The &s;in of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; it is graven upon the tables of their hearts.&mdash;O Jeru|&s;alem wa&s;h thy heart from wickedne&s;s, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved.</HI>&mdash;For <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked: Who can know it?</HI> Jer. iv. 14, and xvii. 1.9.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophets delineate mankind in a na|tural, impenitent &s;tate. And do the Apo&s;tles dip their pencil in brighter colours? Let them &s;peak for them&s;elves. The chief of them in|forms us, that <HI>the natural,</HI> unrenewed <HI>man re|ceives not the things of the Spirit of God,</HI> and that <HI>they are fooli&s;hne&s;s to him.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 14. And he lays it down as matter of fact, that <HI>the carnal mind,</HI> the ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition of every unrege|nerate per&s;on, <HI>is</HI> not only aver&s;e to goodne&s;s, but ENMITY it&s;elf <HI>again&s;t God,</HI> the adorable fountain of all excellence. A blacker line can hardly be drawn, to de&s;cribe a fallen, diabolical nature. Rom. viii. 7.</P>
<P>Various are the names, which the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles gives to our original corruption; and they are all expre&s;&s;ive of its pernicious na|ture, and dreadful effects. He calls it empha|tically <HI>Sin,</HI> a &s;in &s;o full of activity and energy, that it is the life and &s;pring of all others:&mdash;<HI>In|dwelling Sin,</HI> a &s;in which is not like the leaves and fruits of a bad tree, that appear for a time, and then drop off; but like the &s;ap that dwells and works within, always ready to break out at every bud:&mdash;<HI>The body of Sin,</HI> becau&s;e it is an a&s;&s;emblage of all the members which con&s;titute the human frame:&mdash;<HI>The law of &s;in,</HI> and <HI>the Law in our members,</HI> becau&s;e it hath a con&s;train|ing
<PB N="17" REF="017930_0014_0FA37E39F990BD78">
force, and rules in our mortal bodies, as a mighty tyrant in the kingdom which he hath u&s;urped:&mdash;<HI>The old man,</HI> becau&s;e we have it from the fir&s;t man, Adam; and becau&s;e it is as old as the fir&s;t &s;tamina of our frame, with which it is mo&s;t clo&s;ely interwoven:&mdash;<HI>The fle&s;h,</HI> as being propagated by carnal generation, and always oppo&s;ing the Spirit, the gracious prin|ciple, which we have from Adam the &s;econd:&mdash; And <HI>Concupi&s;cence,</HI> that my&s;tic Jezebel, who brings forth the infinite variety of <HI>fle&s;hly, worldly,</HI> and <HI>mental lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are St. James and St. John le&s;s &s;evere than St. Paul, upon the unconverted man. The one ob&s;erves, that his <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> the be&s;t property naturally belonging to him, <HI>de&s;cendeth not from above, but is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h:</HI> And the other po&s;itively declares, that <HI>The whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s.</HI> James iii. 15. 1 John v. 19.</P>
<P>Our Lord, who&s;e &s;pirit in&s;pired the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, confirms their lamentable te&s;ti|mony.

<P N="2">II. I flatter my&s;elf that the doctrine, which we are to try by the touch &s;tone of rea&s;on, has been already &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed from &s;crip|ture. Neverthele&s;s, that the Reader may have the fulle&s;t view of &s;o momentous a &s;ubject, I &s;hall yet pre&s;ent him with a recapitulation of the whole, in the words of our pious Reformers, taken out of the Articles, Homilies, and Liturgy of the Church of England.</P>
<P>The 9th Article thus de&s;cribes our depravity and danger: <HI>Original, or birth-&s;in is the fault, and corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, &s;o that the fle&s;h lu&s;teth always contrary to the &s;pi|rit; and therefore in every per&s;on born into this world, it de&s;erveth God's wrath and damnation.</HI></P>
<P>The 35th Article gives &s;anction to the Homi|lies, in the following words: <HI>The book of Homi|lies contains a good and whole&s;ome doctrine, and therefore we judge them to be read in churches, by mini&s;ters, diligently and di&s;tinctly, that they may be under&s;tood by the people.</HI> Let us then &s;ee, how they &s;et forth the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>whole&s;ome,</HI> though lamentable and humbling doctrine of our lo&s;t e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The title of the 2d is: <HI>A Sermon of the mi|&s;ery of mankind, and of his condemnation to death everla&s;ting by his &s;in.</HI> In the clo&s;e of it, the contents of it are &s;ummed up in the&s;e words: <HI>We have heard how evil we are of our&s;elves; how of our&s;elves, and by our&s;elves, we have no
<PB N="23" REF="017930_0020_0FA37E3E7B213CD0">
goodne&s;s, help, or &s;alvation; but on the contrary, &s;in, damnation, and death everla&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Our church is uniform in her woful accounts of man's mi&s;ery. Hear her in the 1&s;t Homily for Whit&s;unday: <HI>Man,</HI> OF HIS OWN NATURE (&s;ince the fall) <HI>is fle&s;hly and carnal, corrupt and nought, &s;inful and di&s;obedient to God, without any &s;park of goodne&s;s in him, without any virtuous or godly motion, only given to evil thoughts and wicked deeds.</HI></P>
<P>In the Homily on the nativity, &s;he &s;peaks thus: <HI>He</HI> (di&s;obedient man) <HI>was now cur&s;ed and abhor'd. In&s;tead of the image of God, he was now become the image of the devil, the bond &s;lave of hell. Altogether &s;potted and defiled, he &s;eemed to be nothing el&s;e but a lump of &s;in; and therefore, by the ju&s;t judgment of God, he was condemned to everla&s;ting death. Thus, in Adam, all men be|came univer&s;ally mortal, having in them&s;elves nothing but</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prejudiced per&s;ons, who in&s;tead of con&s;idering the entire &s;y&s;tem of truth, run away with a part de|tached from the whole, will be offended here, as if our Church "damn'd every body". But the candid Reader will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that, in&s;tead of dooming any one to de&s;truction, &s;he only declares, that the Saviour finds all men in a &s;tate of condemnation and mi&s;ery, where they would eternally remain, were it not for the compa&s;&s;ionate equity of our gracious God, which does not permit him to &s;entence to a <HI>con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> of <HI>eternal</HI> torments, any one of his creatures, for a &s;in, of which they never were <HI>per&s;onally</HI> guilty; and of which, con&s;equently, they can never have any <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></NOTE> <HI>everla&s;ting damnation of body and &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame doctrine is delivered with the &s;ame plainne&s;s in the 2d part of the Homily on the
<PB N="24" REF="017930_0021_0FA37E3F449585E0">
pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Adam died the death, that is, became mortal, lo&s;t the favour of God, and was ca&s;t out of paradi&s;e, being no longer a citizen of heaven, but a firebrand of hell, and a bond-&s;lave of the devil. And St. Paul bears witne&s;s, that by Adam's offence death came upon all men to condemnation, who be|came plain reprobates, and ca&s;t-aways, * being per|petually damned to the everla&s;ting pains of hell-fire.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to this, we are taught, in the 2d part of the Homily on repentance, that <HI>part of that virtue con&s;i&s;ts in an unfeigned acknowledgement of our &s;ins to God, whom, by them we have &s;o grievou&s;ly offended, that if he &s;hould deal with us according to his ju&s;tice, we de&s;erve a thou&s;and hells, if there were &s;o many.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame vein of whole&s;ome, though unplea|&s;ant doctrine runs through the Liturgy of our church. She opens her &s;ervice by exhorting us <HI>not to di&s;&s;emble, nor cloak, our manifold &s;ins and wickedne&s;s.</HI> She acknowledges in her confe&s;&s;ions, that <HI>we have erred and &s;trayed from God's ways like lo&s;t &s;heep,</HI>&mdash;that <HI>there is no health in us,</HI>&mdash;that we are <HI>mi&s;erable &s;inners, mi&s;erable offenders, to whom our &s;ins are grievous,</HI> and <HI>the burden of them is intolerable.</HI></P>
<P>She begins her bapti&s;mal office by reminding us, that <HI>all men are conceived and born in &s;in.</HI> She teaches in her catechi&s;m, that <HI>we are by nature born in &s;in, and the children of wrath.</HI> She con|fe&s;&s;es in the collect before the general thank&s;|giving, that <HI>we are tied and bound with the chain of our &s;ins,</HI> and intreats God to <HI>let the pitifulne&s;s of his great mercy loo&s;e us:</HI> And in her &s;uffrages &s;he be&s;eeches him to <HI>have mercy upon us,</HI> to <HI>&s;pare us,</HI> and <HI>make &s;peed to &s;ave us</HI>; a language that can &s;uit none but condemned &s;inners.</P>
<P>Duly &s;en&s;ible of our extreme danger till we
<PB N="25" REF="017930_0022_0FA37E3FF9BFE7B0">
have &s;ecured an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, at the grave &s;he &s;upplicates the <HI>mo&s;t holy God, not to deliver us into the bitter pains of eternal death</HI>; and in the litany &s;he be&s;eeches our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>by his agony and bloody &s;weat, by his cro&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> to <HI>deliver us from his wrath and everla&s;ting dam|nation.</HI> Thus is our church every where con|&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf, and with the oracles of God, in repre&s;enting us as corrupt, condemned creatures, in Adam: till we are penitent, ab|&s;olved believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The doctrine to be demon&s;trated in this trea|ti&s;e being thus fully &s;tated, in the con&s;entaneous words of the &s;acred Writers, and our pious Re|formers, I &s;hall clo&s;e this part by an appeal to the Reader's candour and common &s;en&s;e.

<P>If we let our thoughts a&s;cend, from the little &s;ufferers, to the mothers that bear them, we &s;hall find another dreadful proof of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure and of our natural depravity. Does not a good ma&s;ter, much more a gracious God, delight in the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of his faithful &s;ervants? If mankind were naturally in their Creator's favour, would he not order the fruit of the womb to drop from it, without any more inconveniency, than ripe vegetables fall

from the opening hu&s;k, or full-grown fruit from the di&s;burdened tree? But how widely dif|ferent is the ca&s;e!</P>
<P>Fix your attention on pregnant mothers: See their di&s;quietude and fears. Some go before|hand through an imaginary travel, almo&s;t as painful to the mind, as the real labour is to the body. The dreaded hour comes at la&s;t. Good God! What lingering, what tearing pains; what redoubled throes, what killing agonies at|tend it! See the cur&s;e&mdash;or rather, &s;ee it not. Let the daughter of her who ta&s;ted the forbid|den fruit without the man, drink that bitter cup Without him. Fly from the mournful &s;cene, fly to di&s;tant apartments&mdash;But in vain&mdash;The din of &s;orrow pur&s;ues and overtakes you there.</P>
<P>A child of man is at the point of being born; his tortured mother proclaims the news in the bittere&s;t accents. They increa&s;e with her in|crea&s;ing agony. Sympathize and pray, while &s;he &s;uffers and groans&mdash;Perhaps while &s;he &s;uf|fers and dies: For it is po&s;&s;ibly her dying groan that reaches your ear. Perhaps nature is &s;pent in the hard travel; her &s;on is born, and with Jacob's wife, &s;he clo&s;es her languid eye and ex|pires. Perhaps the in&s;truments of death are upon her: The keen &s;teel mangles her delicate frame: As Cae&s;ar's mother, &s;he generou&s;ly &s;uf|fers her body to be opened, that her unborn child may not be torn from her in pieces; and the fertile tree is unnaturally cut down, that its fruit may be &s;afely gathered.</P>
<P>Perhaps neither mother nor child can be &s;aved, and one grave is going to deprive a di&s;|tracted mortal of a beloved Rachel, and a long expected Benjamin. If this is the ca&s;e, O Earth! Earth! Earth! conceal the&s;e &s;lain, cover their

blood, and detain in thy dark bo&s;om, the fear|ful cur&s;e that brought them there. Vain wi&s;h! Too active to be confined in thy deepe&s;t vaults, it ranges through the world: With unrelenting fiercene&s;s it pur&s;ues trembling mothers, and forces them to lift up their voice for &s;peedy re|lief: Though varied according to the accents of an hundred languages, it is the &s;ame voice, that of the bittere&s;t angui&s;h: And while it is reverberated from hamlet to hamlet, from city to city, it &s;trikes the unprejudiced inquirer, and makes him confe&s;s, that the&s;e clouds of unbribed witne&s;&s;es, by their loud, con&s;entaneous evidence, impeach SIN, the tormenter of the woman, and murderer of her offspring.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e is not &s;o fatal, and &s;he is at la&s;t delivered; her labour may be over, yet not her pain and danger; a lingering weakne&s;s may carry her &s;lowly to her grave. If &s;he reco|vers, &s;he may be a mother, and yet unable to act a mother's part. Her pining child &s;ucks her di&s;|ordered brea&s;t in vain: Either the &s;prings of his balmy food are dried up, or they overflow with a putrid, loath&s;ome fluid, and excruciating ul|cers cau&s;e the &s;oft lips of the infant to appear terrible as the edge of the &s;word.</P>
<P>If &s;he happily e&s;capes this common kind of di&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;he may date the beginning of &s;ome chronical di&s;ea&s;e, from her dangerous lying-in; and, in con&s;equence of her hard wre&s;tling for the ble&s;&s;ing of a child, may with the patriarch go halting all her days.

<P>Some will probably &s;ay, "This picture of the world is drawn with black lines, but kinder providence blends light and &s;hade together, and tempers our calamities with numberle&s;s ble&s;s|ings." I an&s;wer: It cannot be too thankfully acknowledged, that, while patience &s;u&s;pends the &s;troke of ju&s;tice, God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, re&s;tores

us a thou&s;and forfeited ble&s;&s;ings, that <HI>his good|ne&s;s may lead us to repentance.</HI> But alas! What is the con&s;equence, where divine grace does not prove victorious over corrupt nature? To all our &s;ins, do we not add the crime of either en|joying the favours of providence with the greate&s;t ingratitude, or of abu&s;ing them with the mo&s;t provoking in&s;olence.</P>
<P>Our actions are far more expre&s;&s;ive of our real &s;entiments, than our words. Why this variety of exqui&s;ite food, &s;ays the voluptuary, who&s;e life loudly &s;peaks what his lips dare not utter? Why this abundance of delicious wines, but to tempt my unbridled appetite, and plea&s;e my luxurious palate?&mdash;Would God have given &s;oftne&s;s to &s;ilks, brightne&s;s to colours, and lu&s;tre to diamonds, &s;ays the &s;elf-applauding &s;mile of a fooli&s;h virgin, who wor&s;hips her&s;elf in a gla&s;s? Would he have commanded the white of the lily thus to meet the blu&s;h of the ro&s;e, and heighten &s;o elegant a proportion of features, if he had not de&s;igned that the united powers of art, dre&s;s, and beauty, &s;hould make me &s;hare his divine honours?&mdash;Why are we ble&s;&s;ed with dear children and amiable friends, &s;ays the ridi|culous behaviour of fond parents and raptured lovers, but that we &s;hould &s;u&s;pend our hap|pine&s;s on their ravi&s;hing &s;miles, and place them as favourite idols in the &s;hrine of our hearts?&mdash; And why has heaven favoured me both with a &s;trong con&s;titution, and an affluent fortune, &s;ays the rich &s;lave of bruti&s;h lu&s;ts, but that I may drink deeper of earthly joys and &s;en&s;ual delights?</P>
<P>Thus ble&s;&s;ings abu&s;ed or unimproved, become cur&s;es in our hands: God's indulgence encou|rages us to offend him: We have the fatal
<PB N="59" REF="017930_0056_0FA37E59794CFDB8">
&s;kill of extracting poi&s;on from the &s;weete&s;t flowers; and madly turn the gifts of providence into weapons, to attack our Benefactor and de|&s;troy our&s;elves. That there are then &s;uch per|verted gifts, does not prove that mankind are in|nocent, but that <HI>God's patience endureth yet daily,</HI> and that a Saviour <HI>ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for us.</HI></P>
<P>Should it be farther objected, that "our plea|&s;ures counter-balance our calamities:" I an&s;|wer: The greate&s;t part of mankind are &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ed with want and cares, toil and &s;ickne&s;s, that their intervals of ea&s;e may rather be termed "an alleviation of mi&s;ery," than "an enjoy|ment of happine&s;s." Our pains are real and la&s;ting, our joys imaginary and momentary. Could we exerci&s;e all our &s;en&s;es upon the mo&s;t plea&s;ing objects, the tooth-ach would render all in&s;ipid and burden&s;ome; a fit of the gout alone damps every worldly joy, while all earthly de|lights together cannot give us ea&s;e under it: So va&s;tly &s;uperior is the bitterne&s;s of one bodily pain, to the &s;weetne&s;s of all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e!</P>
<P>If objectors &s;till urge, that "&s;ufferings are needful for our trial:" I reply, They are nece&s;|&s;ary for our <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> and <HI>correction,</HI> but not for our <HI>trial.</HI> A good king can <HI>try</HI> the loyalty of his &s;ubjects, without putting them to the rack. Let Nero and Bonner <HI>try</HI> the innocent by all &s;orts of tortures, but let not their barba|rity be charged upon a God &s;trictly ju&s;t, and infinitely good.</P>
<P>However, "calamities prove a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;eme."&mdash;And &s;o does tran&s;portation: But who ever inferred from thence, that reformed felons were tran&s;ported for the <HI>trial</HI> of their virtue,
<PB N="60" REF="017930_0057_0FA37E5A395F39B0">
and not for the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of their crimes? I conclude therefore, that our calamities and mi|&s;eries demon&s;trate our corruption, as &s;trongly as the puni&s;hments of the ba&s;tinado and pillory, appointed by an equitable judge, prove the guilt of tho&s;e, on whom they are frequently and &s;e|verely inflicted.</P>

<P>Would to God the multiplied calamities of life were a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for our de&s;|perate wickedne&s;s! But alas! they only make way for the pangs of death.

<P>If the reader is offended, and denies the mor|tifying a&s;&s;ertion, let him vi&s;it with me the mournful &s;pot, where thou&s;ands are daily exe|cuted, and where hundreds make this moment their dying &s;peech. I do not mean what &s;ome call "the bed of honour," a field of battle, but a common death-bed.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, as we go along, tho&s;e black tro|phies of the king of terrors, tho&s;e e&s;cutcheons, which prepo&s;terous vanity fixes up in honour of the decea&s;ed, when kind charity &s;hould hang them out as a warning to the living; let us re|pair to tho&s;e mournful apartments, where weep|ing attendants &s;upport the dying, where &s;woon|ing friends embrace the dead, or whence di&s;|tracted relatives carry out the pale remains of all their joy.</P>
<P>Guided by their groans and funeral lights, let us proceed to the dreary charnal-hou&s;es and
<PB N="61" REF="017930_0058_0FA37E5AF8009410">
calvaries, which we decently call <HI>vaults</HI> and <HI>church-yards:</HI> and without &s;topping to look at the monuments of &s;ome, whom my objector re|members as vigorous as him&s;elf; and of others, who were perhaps his partners in nightly revels; let us ha&s;ten to &s;ee the du&s;t of his mouldered an|ce&s;tors, and to read upon yonder coffins, the dear name of a parent, a child, perhaps a wife, turned off from his bo&s;om into the gulph of eternity.</P>
<P>If this &s;ight does not convince him, I &s;hall open one of the noi&s;ome repo&s;itories, and &s;hew him the deep hollows of tho&s;e eyes, that darted tender &s;en&s;ation into his &s;oul; and odious rep|tiles fattened upon the once charming, now gha&s;tly face, he doted upon.&mdash;But, methinks he turns pale at the very propo&s;al, and, rather than be confronted with &s;uch witne&s;&s;es, acknow|ledges, that he is condemned to die, with all his dear relatives, and the whole human race.</P>
<P>And is this the ca&s;e? Are we then under &s;entence of death? How awful is the con&s;idera|tion! Of all the things that nature dreads, is not <HI>death</HI> the mo&s;t terrible? And is it not (as being the greate&s;t of temporal evils) appointed by hu|man and divine laws, for the puni&s;hment of ca|pital offenders; whether they are named <HI>felons</HI> and <HI>traitors,</HI> or more generally called <HI>men</HI> and <HI>&s;inners?</HI> Let matter of fact decide.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t earthly judges condemn murderers and traitors to be hanged or beheaded; does not <HI>the Judge of all,</HI> &s;entence &s;inful mankind, either to pine away with old age, or be wa&s;ted with con|&s;umptions, burned with fevers, &s;calded with hot humors, eaten up with cancers, putrified by mortifications, &s;uffocated by a&s;thmas, &s;trangled by quin&s;eys, poi&s;oned by the cup of exce&s;s, &s;tabbed with the knife of luxury, or racked to
<PB N="62" REF="017930_0059_0FA37E5BB98E8328">
death by di&s;orders as loath&s;ome, and accidents as various as their &s;ins?</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of their execution, where is the material difference be|tween the malefactor and the &s;inner? The jailor and the turnkey confine the one to his cell: The di&s;order and the phy&s;ician confine the other to his bed. The one lives upon bread and water: The other upon draughts and bo|lu&s;es. The one can walk with his fetters: The other loaded with bli&s;ters can &s;carcely turn him&s;elf. The one enjoys freedom from pain, and has the perfect u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es: The other complains he is racked all over, and is frequently delirious. The executioner does his office upon the one in a few minutes: But the phy&s;ician and his medicines, make the other linger for days, before he can die out of his mi&s;ery. An hone&s;t &s;heriff, and con&s;tables armed with &s;taves, wait upon one; while a greedy undertaker and his party, with like emblems of authority, ac|company the other: And if it is any advantage to have a numerous attendance, without com|pari&s;on the felon his the greater train.</P>
<P>When the pangs of death are over, does not the difference made between the corp&s;es con&s;i&s;t more in appearance than reality? The murderer is di&s;&s;ected in the &s;urgeon's hall gratis, and the rich &s;inner is embowelled in his own apartment at great expence. The robber expo&s;ed to open air, wa&s;tes away in hoops of iron; and the gen|tleman confined to a damp vault, moulders away in &s;heets of lead: And while the fowls of the air greedily prey upon the one, the vermin of the earth eagerly devour the other.</P>
<P>And if you con&s;ider them as launching into the world of &s;pirits; is not the advantage, in one re&s;pect, on the malefactor's &s;ide? He is &s;o|lemnly
<PB N="63" REF="017930_0060_0FA37E5C7ADD7158">
a&s;&s;ured he mu&s;t die; and when the death-warrant comes down, all about him bid him prepare, and make the be&s;t of his &s;hort time: But the phy&s;ician and chaplain, friends and attendants, generally flatter the honourable &s;inner to the la&s;t: And what is the con&s;equence? He either &s;leeps on in carnal &s;ecurity, till death puts an end to all his delu&s;ive dreams; or, if he has &s;ome notion that he mu&s;t repent, for fear of di&s;compo&s;ing his &s;pirits, he &s;till puts it off till <HI>to morrow</HI>; and in the mid&s;t of his delays God &s;ays, <HI>Thou Fool,</HI> THIS NIGHT <HI>thy &s;oul &s;hall be re|quired of thee.</HI> What wonder is it then, if when the converted thief goes from the ignominious tree to paradi&s;e, the impenitent rich man pa&s;&s;es from <HI>his purple bed,</HI> into an awful eternity, and there <HI>lifts up his eyes in</HI> unexpected <HI>torments?</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e are truths too obvious to be denied, wilt thou, Sinner, as the thoughtle&s;s vulgar, blunt their edge, by &s;aying, with amazing un|concern, "Death is a debt we mu&s;t all pay to nature?" Alas! This is granting the point; for if all have contracted &s;o dreadful a debt, all are in a corrupt and lo&s;t &s;tate. Nor is this debt to be paid to <HI>Nature,</HI> but to <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>; other|wi&s;e dying would be as ea&s;y as &s;leeping, or any other natural action: But it is beyond expre&s;|&s;ion terrible to thee, from who&s;e &s;oul the Re|deemer has not extracted <HI>&s;in,</HI> the mon&s;ter's <HI>&s;ting:</HI> And if thou do&s;t not &s;ee it now in the mo&s;t alarming light, it is becau&s;e either thou imagine&s;t it at a great di&s;tance; or the double veil of ra&s;h pre&s;umption, and bruti&s;h &s;tupidity, is yet upon thy hardened heart.</P>
<P>Or wilt thou, as the poor Heathens, comfort thy&s;elf with the cruel thought, that "thou &s;halt not die alone?" Alas! dying companions may increa&s;e, but cannot take off the horror of de&s;o|lution.

<P>WE have hitherto con&s;idered man as a mi&s;erable inhabitant of a wretched world. We have &s;een him &s;urrounded by mul|titudes of wants; pur&s;ued by legions of di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, maladies, and woes; arre&s;ted by the king of terrors: ca&s;t into the grave; and &s;hut up there, the loath&s;ome prey of corruption and worms. Let us now con&s;ider him as a <HI>moral agent</HI>; and by examining his di&s;po&s;ition, cha|racter, and conduct, let us &s;ee whether he is wi&s;ely puni&s;hed, according to the &s;entence of impartial ju&s;tice; or wantonly tormented, at the caprice of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>We cannot help acknowledging, it is highly rea&s;onable, fir&s;t, that all intelligent creatures &s;hould love, reverence, and obey their Creator; becau&s;e he is mo&s;t eminently their Father, their Ma&s;ter, and their King: Secondly, that they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;upport, and love each other, as fellow-&s;ubjects, fellow-&s;ervants, and children of the &s;ame univer&s;al parent: And thirdly, that they &s;hould pre&s;erve their &s;ouls and bodies in peace and purity; by which means alone they can be happy in them&s;elves, profitable to man, and acceptable to God. This is what we ge|nerally call <HI>natural religion,</HI> which is evidently founded upon eternal rea&s;on, the fitne&s;s of things, and the e&s;&s;ential relation of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The propriety of the&s;e &s;anctions is &s;o &s;elf-evident, that <HI>the Gentiles, who have not the</HI> written <HI>law, are a law unto them&s;elves, and do</HI> (but alas!

<P>Since the moral law &s;o &s;trongly recommends it&s;elf to rea&s;on, let us &s;ee how univer&s;ally it is ob&s;erved or broken: So &s;hall matter of fact de|cide, whether we are pure and upright, or pol|luted and depraved.</P>

<P>But, though we &s;eem made of cold inatten|tion, when the &s;ight of divine mercies &s;hould kindle our heart into gratitude and prai&s;e; we &s;oon get out of this languid frame of mind: For, in the pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual gratifications, we are all activity and warmth; we &s;eem an ardent compound of life and fire.</P>
<P>What can be the rea&s;on of this amazing dif|ference? &mdash;What but rebellious &s;en&s;e, and wan|ton appetite, rai&s;ed at the &s;ight or idea of &s;ome forbidden object! The bait of plea&s;ure appears, corrupt nature &s;ummons all her powers, every nerve of expectation is &s;tretched; every pul&s;e of de&s;ire beats high; the blood is in a general fer|ment; the &s;pirits are in an univer&s;al hurry; and though the hook of a fatal con&s;equence is often apparent, the alluring bait mu&s;t be &s;wal|lowed. The fear of God, the mo&s;t ine&s;timable of all trea&s;ures, is already gone; and if the &s;inful gratification cannot be enjoyed upon any other term, a good reputation &s;hall go al&s;o.

<P>Some indeed affirm, that the&s;e conflicts &s;uit a &s;tate of probation and trial. But it is evi|dent, that either our temptations are too vio|lent for our &s;trength, or our &s;trength too weak for our temptations; &s;ince, notwith&s;tanding the

<P>Nor can we exculpate our&s;elves by pleading, that the&s;e triumphs of &s;en&s;e over rea&s;on, are nei|ther long nor frequent. Alas! How many perpetrate an act of wickedne&s;s in a moment, and &s;uffer death it&s;elf for a crime which they never repeated!</P>
<P>See that chry&s;tal ve&s;&s;el. Its brightne&s;s and brittlene&s;s repre&s;ent the &s;hining, and delicate nature of true virtue. If I let it fall, and break it, what avails it to &s;ay, "I never broke it be|fore &mdash;I dropped it but once&mdash;I am exce&s;&s;ively &s;orry for my carele&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;I will &s;et the pieces together, and never break it again:" Will the&s;e excu&s;es and re&s;olutions prevent the ve&s;&s;el from being broken&mdash;broken for ever? The reader may ea&s;ily make the application.</P>
<P>Even Heathen morali&s;ts, by their fabulous account of the companions of Uly&s;&s;es, turned into &s;wine, upon drinking <HI>once</HI> of Circe's en|chanted cup, teach us, that <HI>one</HI> fall into &s;en&s;ua|lity, turns a man into a brute; ju&s;t as one &s;lip into uncha&s;tity or di&s;hone&s;ty, changes a mode&s;t woman into a &s;trumpet, or an hone&s;t man into a thief. Again,</P>
<P>Ought not rea&s;on to have as ab&s;olute a com|mand over appetite, as a &s;kilful rider has over a well-broken hor&s;e? But &s;uppo&s;e we &s;aw all hor&s;emen univer&s;ally ma&s;tered, one time or other, by their bea&s;ts; and forced, though but for a few minutes, to receive the bit, and go or &s;top at the plea&s;ure of the wanton brutes: &s;hould we not wonder, and ju&s;tly infer, that man had lo&s;t the kind of &s;uperiority, which he &s;till main|tains over dome&s;tic animals?

<P>We may then conclude, that the univer&s;al re|bellion of our lower faculties again&s;t our &s;upe|rior powers, and the triumphs of &s;en&s;e over rea|&s;on, demon&s;trate, that human nature has &s;uf|fered as fatal a revolution, as the&s;e kingdoms did, when a degraded king was &s;een bleeding on the &s;caffold, and a ba&s;e u&s;urper lording it in the &s;eat of maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>And has our MEMORY e&s;caped unimpaired by the fall?

The eternal Beauty, for who&s;e contemplation; the &s;upreme Good, for who&s;e enjoyment he was created, is generally forgotten, de&s;pi&s;ed, or hated. If the thought of his holy Maje&s;ty pre&s;ents it|&s;elf, he looks upon it as an intruder: It lays him under as di&s;agreeable a re&s;traint, as that, which the pre&s;ence of a grave, pious ma&s;ter puts upon a wanton, idle &s;ervant: Nor can he quietly pur&s;ue his &s;inful cour&s;es, till he has driven away the trouble&s;ome idea; or imagined with the Epicure a carele&s;s God, who wants re&s;olution to call him to an account, and ju&s;tice to puni&s;h him for his iniquity.</P>
<P>Does any one offer an indignity to his fa|vourite friend, or only &s;peak contemptibly of the object of his e&s;teem, he feels as if he was the per&s;on in&s;ulted, and reddening with indig|nation, directly e&s;pou&s;es his cau&s;e: But every body, the meane&s;t of his attendants not ex|cepted, may with impunity in&s;ult the King of kings in his pre&s;ence, and take the mo&s;t pro|fane liberties with his name and word, his laws and mini&s;ters: He hear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wild bla&s;phemy, and regards it not; he &s;ees the horrid outrage, and re&s;ents it not; and yet, amazing infatua|tion! he pretends to love God.</P>
<P>If he goes to the play, he can fix his roving eyes, and wandering mind, three hours together upon the &s;ame trifling objects, not only without wearine&s;s, but with uncommon delight.

<P>But as the heart-felt love of God is &s;uppo&s;ed to be downright enthu&s;ia&s;m by &s;ome morali&s;ts, who, da&s;hing in pieces the fir&s;t table of the law again&s;t the &s;econd, pretend that all our duty to God con&s;i&s;ts in the love of our neighbour; let us examine the unconverted man's charity, and &s;ee whether he bears more love to his fellow-creatures than to his Creator.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more erroneous than his no|tions of <HI>charity.</HI> He confounds it with the bare <HI>giving of alms</HI>; not con&s;idering that it is po&s;&s;ible to do this kind of good, from the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and <HI>uncharitable</HI> motives.

friendle&s;s old age, or &s;upporting infirm and mutilated indigence, he fancies, that he gives an indubitable proof of his <HI>charity.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes too he affixes to that word, the idea of a fond hope, that every body is going to heaven: For if you intimate, that the rich vo|luptuary is not with Lazarus in Abraham's bo|&s;om, and that the fooli&s;h virgins are not promi&s;|cuou&s;ly admitted to glory with the wi&s;e, he won|ders at.

<P>He con&s;iders not, that <HI>charity</HI> is the fair off|&s;pring of the <HI>love of God,</HI> to which he is yet an utter &s;tranger; and that it con&s;i&s;ts in an uni|ver&s;al, di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to all mankind, our wor&s;t enemies not excepted: A benevo|lence, that &s;weetly evidences it&s;elf by bearing with patience the evil which they do to us, and kindly doing them all the good we po&s;&s;ibly can, both with re&s;pect to their &s;oul and body, their property and reputation.</P>
<P>If this is a ju&s;t definition of charity, the un|renewed man has not even the out&s;ide of it. To prove it, I might appeal to his impatience and ill-humour, his unkind words and cutting ral|leries (for I &s;uppo&s;e him too moral ever to &s;lan|der or cur&s;e any one:) I might mention his &s;u|percilious behaviour to &s;ome, who are intitled to his affability as men, countrymen, and neigh|bours: I might expatiate on his readine&s;s to ex|culpate, enrich, or aggrandize him&s;elf at the ex|pence of <HI>others,</HI> whenever he can do it without expo&s;ing <HI>him&s;elf.</HI></P>

If this is a &s;pe|cimen of the unconverted man's love, what mu&s;t be his hatred!</P>
<P>But I happily mi&s;take: "He is no libertine, he has a virtuous wife, and amiable children, and he loves them, &s;ay you, with the tendere&s;t af|fection."

perhaps only to the fear of con&s;equences, and to the want of natural boldne&s;s, or of a &s;uitable temptation and fair opportunity to &s;in.

That the&s;e &s;eeds lurk within the heart, before they are forced up by the heat of temptation, appears indubitable, if we con&s;ider, 1. That all children, on particular occa&s;ions, manife&s;t &s;ome early inclination to tho&s;e &s;ins, which the feeble|ne&s;s of their bodily organs, and the want of proper ferments in their blood, do not permit them to commit: 2. That infants betray envy, ill-humour, impatience, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, anger, and
<PB N="103" REF="017930_0100_0FA37DD03A64CE88">
ob&s;tinacy, even before they can take particular notice of ill examples, and under&s;tand bad coun&s;els: And, 3. That though uncleanne&s;s, fornication, and adultery, on account of the &s;hame and danger attending them, are commit|ted with &s;o much &s;ecrecy, that the <HI>examples</HI> of them are &s;eldom, if ever, given in public; they are neverthele&s;s &s;ome of the crimes which are mo&s;t univer&s;ally or eagerly committed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if we were not more inclined to vice than virtue, good examples would be as com|mon, and have as much force, as bad ones. Therefore, the generality of bad examples can|not ari&s;e but from the general &s;infulne&s;s of man; and to account for this general &s;infulne&s;s by the generality of bad examples, is <HI>begging</HI> the que|&s;tion, and not <HI>proving</HI> the point.</P>
<P>Add to this, that as weeds, &s;ince the cur&s;e, grow even in fields &s;own with the be&s;t wheat; &s;o vice, &s;ince the fall, grows in the mid&s;t of the be&s;t examples, and the mo&s;t excellent educa|tion: Witne&s;s the barbarous crimes committed by pious Jacob's children, and penitent Adam's elde&s;t &s;on.</P>

What need is there then to &s;uppo&s;e, that he com|municated to his po&s;terity an inbred prone|ne&s;s to &s;in?</Q></P>
<P>To this I reply, It is not one accident or &s;ingle event, but a continual repetition of the &s;ame event, that proves a pronene&s;s. If a man, who is perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, by &s;ome unfore|&s;een

The hour fixed for the ob|&s;tinate engagement is come; and, as if it was not enough that they &s;hould pick each other's eyes out, with the &s;trong bills that nature has given them, human malice, or rather diabolical cruelty, comes to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their native fiercene&s;s. Silver &s;purs, or &s;teel talons, &s;harper than tho&s;e of the eagle, are barbarou&s;ly fa&s;tened to their feet: Thus armed, they are excited to leap at each other, and in an hundred repeated on&s;ets to tear their feathers and fle&s;h, as if they were contending vultures; and if at la&s;t one blinded, covered with blood and wounds, and unable to &s;tand any longer the metallic claws of his antagoni&s;t, enters into the agonies of death; the numerous ring of &s;tamping, clapping, &s;hout|ing, eagerly betting, or horridly cur&s;ing &s;pecta|tors, is as highly delighted, as if the tortured, dying creature, was the common enemy of mankind.</P>

<P>But it is perhaps a different &s;pectacle, that recommends it&s;elf to the bloody ta&s;te of our bap|tized Heathens.

<Q>Famine, pe&s;tilence, and war, are the three mo&s;t famous ingredients of this lower world.

<Q>Who can, without horror, con&s;ider the whole earth as the empire of de|&s;truction! It abounds in wonders; it abounds al&s;o in victims; it is a va&s;t field of carnage and contagion. Every &s;pecies is, without pity, pur&s;ued and torn to pieces, through the earth, and air, and water. In man there is <HI>more</HI> wretchedne&s;s, than in <HI>all</HI> other animals put together: He &s;marts continually under two &s;courges, which other animals never feel; anxiety, and a li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in appearance, which make him weary of him&s;elf. He loves life, and yet he knows that he mu&s;t die. If he enjoys &s;ome tran&s;ient good, for which he is thankful to heaven, he &s;uffers various evils, and is at la&s;t devoured by worms. This knowledge is his fatal prerogative: Other animals have it not. He feels it every moment, rankling and corroding in his brea&s;t. Yet he &s;pends the tran&s;ient moment of his ex|i&s;tence, in diffu&s;ing the mi&s;ery that he &s;uffers; in cutting the throats of his fellow-creatures for pay; in cheating and being cheated; in robbing and being robbed; in &s;erving that he may command; and in repenting of all that he does. The bulk of mankind are nothing more than a crowd of wretches, equally cri|minal and unfortunate, and the globe contains rather carca&s;&s;es than men. I tremble, upon a review of this dreadful picture, to find that it implies a complaint again&s;t providence, and I wi&s;h that I had never been born.</Q>
[<HI>Voltaire's Go&s;pel of the Day.</HI>] <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Wild error is often the guide, and glaring con|tradiction the badge, both of tho&s;e, who reject re|velation, like Voltaire; and of tho&s;e, who indirectly &s;et a&s;ide one half of it, like the Phari&s;ees and Anti|nomians around us. See a &s;triking proof of it. This very author, in another book, (O! &s;ee what <HI>anti-chri&s;tian</HI> morality comes to!) repre&s;ents the horrible &s;in of Sodom as an <HI>excu&s;able mi&s;take of nature,</HI> and a&s;|&s;ures us, that
<Q>At the wor&s;t of times, there is at mo&s;t upon earth, one man in a thou&s;and, that can be called wicked.</Q>
Now for the proof!
<Q>Hardly do we &s;ee one of tho&s;e enormous crimes, that &s;hock human nature, committed in ten years at Rome, Paris, or London, tho&s;e cities where the thir&s;t of gain, which is the pa|rent of all crimes, is carried to the highe&s;t pitch&mdash;If men were e&s;&s;entially wicked, we &s;hould find every morning hu&s;bands murdered by their wives, &amp;c. as we do hens killed by foxes.</Q>
According to this apo&s;tle of the dei&s;tical world, it &s;eems, that the mo&s;t inten&s;e thir&s;t of gold is no degree of wickedne&s;s; that a woman, to be very good, needs only not cut her hu&s;band's throat while he is a&s;leep; and that it even little matters whether &s;he omits the dire murder out of regard to <HI>his</HI> life, or <HI>her own.</HI> What moral philo&s;ophy is here! Why, if the &s;in of Sodom is a peccadillo, a frolick&s;ome mi&s;take; and nothing is wickedne&s;s but a treacherous cutting of an hu&s;band's or a parent's throat; I extend my charity four times beyond thee, O Voltaire, and do maintain, that there is not one wicked man in <HI>five thou&s;and.</HI></P>
<P>I in&s;ert this note, to obviate the charge of &s;evere critics, who accu&s;e me of dealing in 'gro&s;s mi&s;repre|&s;entations, fal&s;e quotations, and forgeries,' becau&s;e I quote &s;ome authors, when they &s;peak as the oracles of God; and do not &s;well my book with their in|con&s;i&s;tencies, when they contradict the &s;criptures, rea&s;on, and the truths which they them&s;elves have advanced in &s;ome happy moments; and becau&s;e I cannot force my rea&s;on to maintain with them, both &s;ides of a glaring contradiction.</P>
<P>O ye dei&s;tical morali&s;ts, let me meet with more candor, ju&s;tice, and mercy from you, than I have done from the <HI>warm</HI> oppo&s;ers of the &s;econd go&s;pel-axiom.

For the &s;ake of &s;uch objectors, I here premi&s;e, by way of digre&s;&s;ion, a few rational ar|guments to evince, as far as my contracted plan will allow, the divine authority of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;acred pen-men, the prophets and apo&s;tles, were holy, excellent men, and <HI>would</HI> not; artle&s;s, illiterate men, and therefore <HI>could</HI> not, lay the horrible &s;cheme of deluding man|kind.

<PB N="135" REF="017930_0132_0FA37DE839FE15A8">
nakedne&s;s, &s;tocks and pri&s;ons, racks and tor|tures; which indeed was all that they could, or did expect, in con&s;equence of Chri&s;t's expre&s;s declarations. Neither was a de&s;ire of honour the motive of their actions; for their Lord him&s;elf was treated with the utmo&s;t contempt, and had more than once a&s;&s;ured them, that they &s;hould certainly &s;hare the &s;ame fate: Be&s;ides, they were humble men, not above working as mechanics for a coar&s;e maintenance, and &s;o little de&s;irous of human regard, that they expo&s;ed to the world the meanne&s;s of their birth and occupations, their great ignorance and &s;candalous falls.</P>
<P>Add to this, that they were &s;o many, and lived at &s;uch di&s;tance of time and place from each other, that had they been impo&s;tors, it would have been impracticable for them to con|trive and carry on a forgery, without being de|tected. And as they neither would nor could <HI>deceive</HI> the world; &s;o they neither could nor would <HI>be deceived</HI> them&s;elves: For they were days, months, and years, <HI>eye</HI> and <HI>ear</HI> witne&s;&s;es of the things which they relate; and when they had not the fulle&s;t evidence of important facts, they in&s;i&s;ted upon new proofs, and even upon &s;en&s;ible demon&s;trations; as for in&s;tance, Tho|mas, in the matter of our Lord's re&s;urrection, <HI>John</HI> xx. 25. And to leave us no room to que|&s;tion their &s;incerity, mo&s;t of them joyfully &s;ealed the truth of their doctrines with their own blood. Did <HI>&s;o many</HI> and <HI>&s;uch</HI> marks of veracity, ever meet in any other authors?</P>
<P N="2">2. But even while they lived, they confirmed their te&s;timony by a variety of miracles, wrought in divers places, and for a number of years; &s;ometimes before thou&s;ands of their enemies, as the miracles of Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples; &s;ome|times
<PB N="136" REF="017930_0133_0FA37DE9025D6C48">
before hundreds of thou&s;ands, as tho&s;e of Mo&s;es. The&s;e miracles were &s;o well known and atte&s;ted, that when both Chri&s;t and Mo&s;es appealed to their authenticity, before their bit|tere&s;t oppo&s;ers, mentioning the per&s;ons upon whom, as well as the particular times when, and the places where, they had been performed; the facts were never denied, but pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, or maliciou&s;ly attributed to the prince of the devils. By &s;uch a <HI>pitiful &s;lander</HI> as this, Porphyry, Hierocles, Cel&s;us, and Julian the apo|&s;tate, tho&s;e learned and inveterate enemies of Chri&s;tianity, endeavoured (as the Phari&s;ees had done before them) to &s;ap the argument founded upon the miracles of Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples.

In this re&s;pect the ca&s;e of the primitive Chri&s;tians widely differed from that of Mahomet's followers: For tho&s;e who adhered to the warlike, violent impo&s;tor, &s;aved their lives and properties, or attained to honour, by their new, ea&s;y, and fle&s;h-plea&s;ing religion: But tho&s;e, who devoted them&s;elves to the meek, &s;elf-denying, crucified Je&s;us, were frequently &s;poiled of their goods, and cruelly put to death; or if they e&s;caped with their lives, were looked upon as the very dregs of mankind.</P>
<P>Add to this, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t profound parts of the &s;criptures, were addre&s;&s;ed to the in|habitants of polite Greece, and triumphant Rome, among whom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Not many noble, not many wi&s;e are called,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle; neverthele&s;s &s;ome of both, even at the ri&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, openly &s;tood up for its truth.

<P N="4">4. When the authenticity of the miracles was atte&s;ted by thou&s;ands of living witne&s;&s;es, religi|ous rites were in&s;tituted, and performed by hun|dreds of thou&s;ands, agreeable to &s;cripture in|junctions, in order to perpetuate that authenti|city.

<Q>In that very day, &s;in &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly &s;eparate between thee and the God of thy life: Thou &s;halt certainly lo&s;e the glorious view, which thou ha&s;t of my boundle&s;s goodne&s;s and infinite perfections: Thou &s;halt infallibly quench the &s;pirit of ardent love, and &s;top the breath of delightful prai&s;e, by which thou live&s;t both to my glory and thy comfort: And thy &s;oul <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins,</HI> &s;hall remain in the filthy pri&s;on of a mortal body, till death breaks it open, to remove thee to thy own place.</Q></P>
<P>And was not this Adam's ca&s;e after his fall? Did he not <HI>know that he was naked,</HI> &s;tript of the glorious image of his Creator? Did not guilty <HI>&s;hame</HI> immediately prompt him to <HI>hide</HI> and pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ct, as well as he could, his degenerate and en|feebled body? Devoid of the ardent love he felt for God before, and of the pure delight he en|joyed in him, was not he left the wretched prey of tormenting <HI>fears?</HI> Did he not evidence his hatred of his heavenly Benefactor, by <HI>dreading</HI> his voice, and flying from him as ha&s;tily as he &s;hould have fled from the infernal &s;erpent?</P>
<P>Was he not deprived of the knowledge by which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, he di&s;covered the nature of Eve, and gave to all living creatures names ex|pre&s;&s;ive of their re&s;pective properties?&mdash;Was he

<P>This &s;pecious objection, which Dr. Watts acknowledges to be
<Q>the very chief point of dif|ficulty, in all the controver&s;ies about original &s;in,</Q>
is wholly founded upon the vulgar no|tion, that we have our &s;ouls immediately from God by infu&s;ion: It will therefore entirely fall to the ground, if we can prove, that we receive them, as well as our bodies, by traduction from Adam: And that this is fact, appears, if I am not mi&s;taken, by the following arguments,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="160" REF="017930_0157_0FA37DFAFA1B2328">1.

<P N="3">3. All agree, that under God we receive <HI>life</HI> from our parents; and if <HI>life,</HI> then certainly our <HI>&s;oul,</HI> which is the <HI>principle of life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Other animals have power to propagate their own &s;pecies <HI>after its kind</HI>; they can gene|rate <HI>animated</HI> bodies: Why &s;hould man be but <HI>half</HI> a father? When did God &s;tint him to pro|pagate the mere <HI>&s;hell</HI> of his per&s;on, the body without the &s;oul?

Is it not, on the contrary, highly rea&s;onable to conclude, that by virtue of the divine appoint|ment and ble&s;&s;ing, the <HI>whole</HI> man can <HI>be fruitful and multiply</HI>; and the &s;oul, under proper cir|cum&s;tances, can generate a &s;oul, as a thought begets a thought; and can kindle the flame of life, as one taper lights another; without weak|ening

<P N="5">5. Does not <HI>matter of fact</HI> corroborate the preceding argument?

<Q>if Adam was converted when he begat a &s;on, he begat a converted &s;oul.</Q>
This does by no means follow; for if he was born of God after his fall, it was <HI>by grace through faith,</HI> and not by nature through generation: He could not there|fore communicate his <HI>&s;piritual regeneration</HI> by <HI>na|tural generation,</HI> any more than a great &s;cholar can propagate his learning together with his &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Should it be again objected, that
<Q>The &s;oul is not generated, becau&s;e the &s;criptures de|clare, <HI>The Lord is the father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h,</HI> and <HI>The &s;pirit returns to God who gave it:</HI></Q>

<P>Should &s;ome per&s;ons reject what I &s;ay of the traduction of &s;ouls, in order to illu&s;trate the de|rivation of original &s;in: and &s;hould they &s;ay, that they have no more idea of the <HI>generation,</HI> than hone&s;t Nicodemus had of the <HI>regeneration of a &s;pirit:</HI> I beg leave to ob&s;erve two things,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If &s;uch objectors are converted, they will not deny the <HI>regeneration</HI> of &s;ouls by the Spirit of God, &s;ince they experience it, and our Lord &s;peaks of it as a ble&s;&s;ed reality, even while he repre&s;ents it as a my&s;tery <HI>unknown</HI> as to the manner of it, John iii. 8&mdash;13. Now if pious &s;ouls have been <HI>regenerated</HI> from the beginning of the world, without exactly knowing <HI>how</HI>; is it rea&s;onable to deny that &s;ouls are <HI>generated,</HI> merely becau&s;e we cannot exactly account for the manner in which that wonder takes place?</P>
<P>Secondly, Should my objectors be ver&s;ed in natural philo&s;ophy, they need not be told, that even the kind of generation, which they allow, is as much a <HI>my&s;tery</HI> to man, as the movement of a watch is to a child, that ju&s;t &s;ees the ca&s;e and the gla&s;s.

<P>For my part, I do not &s;ee, why the &s;ame al|mighty Pre&s;erver of men, who [as St. Paul tells us] <HI>made of</HI> ONE BLOOD the bodies of <HI>all nations of men,</HI> might not <HI>of one</HI> ACTIVE THOUGHT, and ARDENT DESIRE, <HI>have made</HI> the &s;ouls of <HI>all nations of men</HI> al&s;o.

<P>Having dwelt &s;o long upon the manner in which mankind naturally propagate original corruption, together with their <HI>whole</HI> &s;pecies, I hope I may rea&s;onably re&s;ume the conclu&s;ion of my argument, and affirm, that, if Adam cor|rupted the fountain of human nature in him&s;elf, we, the &s;treams, cannot but be naturally cor|rupted.</P>

<P><Q>But this doctrine, you &s;till urge, drives people to de&s;pair.</Q>
&mdash;Yes, to a de&s;pair of being &s;aved by their own merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and this is as rea&s;onable in a &s;inner who comes to the Saviour, as de&s;pairing to &s;wim acro&s;s the &s;ea, is rational in a pa&s;&s;enger that takes &s;hip. Our church, far from &s;peaking again&s;t it, &s;ays, that <HI>&s;inners &s;hould be di&s;mayed at God's rightful ju&s;tice, and &s;hould</HI> DESPAIR <HI>indeed, as touching any hope th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> may be</HI> IN THEMSELVES. Hom. on falling from God, 2d part.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t de&s;pair of our&s;elves, is widely differ|ent from a de&s;pair of God's mercy, and Chri&s;t's willingne&s;s to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners, who flies to him for refuge. This horrible &s;in, this black crime of Judas, &s;prings rather from a &s;ullen, ob&s;tinate rejection of the remedy, than, as &s;ome vainly &s;uppo&s;e, from a clear knowledge of the

di&s;ea&s;e: And, that none may commit it, Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters take particular care not to preach the law without the go&s;pel, and the fail without the recovery: No &s;ooner have they opened the wound of &s;in, fe&s;tering in the &s;inner's con&s;ci|ence, than they pour in the balm of divine pro|mi&s;es, and make gracious offers of a free pardon and full &s;alvation, by the compa&s;&s;ionate Re|deemer, who came to <HI>ju&s;tify the ungodly</HI> and to <HI>&s;ave the lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed tho&s;e only who &s;ee their &s;in and mi&s;ery, will cordially embrace the go&s;pel; for common &s;en&s;e dictates, that none care for the king's mercy, but tho&s;e who know they are guilty, condemned criminals. How exce&s;&s;ively unrea&s;onable is it then to object, that the preaching of man's corrupt and lo&s;t e&s;tate drives people to de&s;pair of divine mercy, when it is ab&s;olutely the only means of &s;hewing them their need of it, and making them gladly accept it upon God's own terms!</P>

<P N="1">I. INFERENCE. If we are by nature in a cor|rupt and lo&s;t e&s;tate, the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of mini|&s;ters is to rouze our drowzy con&s;ciences, and warn us of our imminent danger: It behoves them to <HI>cry aloud and &s;pare not, to lift up their voice like a trumpet,</HI> and <HI>&s;hew us our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and our &s;ins.</HI> Nor are they to de&s;i&s;t from this unplea&s;ing part of their office, till we <HI>awake to righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>lay hold on the hope &s;et before us.</HI></P>
<P>If preachers, under pretence of peace and good-nature, let the wound fe&s;ter in the con&s;ci|ence of their hearers, to avoid the thankle&s;s of|fice of probing it to the bottom: If, for fear of giving them pain by a timely amputation, they let them die of a mortification: Or if <HI>they heal the hurt of the daughter of God's people &s;lightly, &s;aying, Peace! Peace! when there is no peace</HI>; they imitate tho&s;e &s;ycophants of old, who, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing the rich, and offending the great, <HI>preached &s;mooth things, and prophe&s;ied deceit.</HI></P>
<P>This cruel gentlene&s;s, this &s;oft barbarity, is attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences,
<PB N="178" REF="017930_0175_0FA37E0879E99F60">
and will de&s;ervedly meet with the mo&s;t dreadful puni&s;hment. <HI>Give &s;inners warning from me,</HI> &s;ays the Lord to every mini&s;ter: <HI>When I &s;ay to the wicked,</HI> the unconverted, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;urely die; and thou give&s;t him not warning, he &s;hall die in his iniquity,</HI> in his unconverted &s;tate; <HI>but his blood will I require at</HI> THY <HI>hand.</HI> See Matt. xviii. 3. Ezek. iii. 18. and xiii. 10.</P>
<P N="2">II. INFER. If we are naturally depraved and condemned creatures; <HI>&s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>pride</HI> are the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous of all our &s;ins. The deepe&s;t repentance and profounde&s;t humility become us: To <HI>neglect</HI> them, is to &s;tumble at the very thre&s;hold of true religion; and to <HI>ridicule</HI> them, is to pour contempt upon rea&s;on, revelation, and the fir&s;t operations of di|vine grace on a &s;inner's heart.</P>
<P N="3">III. INFER. If the corruption of mankind is univer&s;al, inveterate, and amazingly powerful, no mere creature can deliver them from it. They mu&s;t remain unre&s;tored; or they mu&s;t have an almighty, omni&s;cient, omnipre&s;ent, un|wearied, infinitely patient Saviour; willing day and night to attend to the wants, and public or &s;ecret applications of millions of wretched &s;ouls; and able to give them immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance throughout the world; in all their various trials, temptations, and conflicts, both in life and in death. Is the mo&s;t exalted <HI>creature</HI> &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?</P>
<P>When &s;uch a va&s;t body as mankind, &s;pread over all the earth for thou&s;ands of years, made up of numerous nations, all of which con&s;i&s;t of multitudes of individuals, each of whom has the &s;prings of all his faculties and powers enfeebled, di&s;ordered, or broken:&mdash;When &s;uch an immen&s;e

body as this, is to be re&s;tored to the image of the infinitely holy, glorious, and ble&s;&s;ed God; common &s;en&s;e dictates, that the amazing ta&s;k can be performed by no other than the original Arti&s;t, the great Searcher of hearts, the omni|potent Creator of mankind.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that, notwith&s;tanding the cavils of Arius, the Saviour is GOD OVER ALL <HI>ble&s;&s;ed for ever, all things were made by him, he upholds all things by the word of his power,</HI> and every believer may adore him, and &s;ay, with the wondering apo&s;tle, when the light of faith &s;hone into his benighted &s;oul, <HI>My Lord and my</HI> God!</P>
<P N="4">IV. INFER. If our guilt is immen&s;e, it cannot be expiated without a &s;acrifice of an in|finite dignity: Hence we di&s;cover the mi&s;take of Heathens and carnal Jews, who tru&s;ted in the &s;acrifices of bea&s;ts; the error of Dei&s;ts, Maho|metans, and Socinians, who &s;ee no need of any expiatory &s;acrifice; and the amazing pre&s;ump|tion of too many Chri&s;tians, who repo&s;e a con|&s;iderable part of their confidence in the proper merit of their works; in&s;tead of placing it en|tirely in the infinitely meritorious &s;acrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God, humbly acknow|ledging that all the gracious rewardablene&s;s of the be&s;t works of faith, is derived from his pre|cious blood and <HI>original</HI> merit.</P>
<P N="5">V. INFER. If our &s;piritual maladies are both numerous and mortal, it is evident, we cannot <HI>recover</HI> the &s;piritual health that we en|joyed in our fir&s;t parents, but by the powerful help of our heavenly Phy&s;ician, the &s;econd Adam. How ab&s;urd is it then to &s;ay, that we
<PB N="180" REF="017930_0177_0FA37E09F9263408">
are &s;aved, or <HI>recovered,</HI> by doing good works, without the quickning grace of a Saviour!</P>
<P>A wretched beggar is lame both in his hands and feet: An officious man, in&s;tead of taking him to a per&s;on famous for his &s;kill in relieving &s;uch objects of di&s;tre&s;s, a&s;&s;ures him, that the only way of getting well, is to run of errands for his prince, and work for his fellow-beggars. You ju&s;tly wonder at the cruelty and folly of &s;uch a director: But you have much more rea|&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the conduct of tho&s;e mi|&s;erable empirics, who direct poor, blind, lame &s;inners, labouring under a complication of &s;pi|ritual di&s;orders, and &s;ick even unto eternal death, to &s;ave them&s;elves merely by &s;erving God, and doing good to their neighbours; as if they needed neither repentance towards God, nor faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor yet free grace to enable them to repent, believe, and &s;erve God acceptably.</P>
<P>How much more rational is the evangelical method of &s;alvation! <HI>We are &s;aved,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, we are re&s;tored to <HI>&s;aving health,</HI> and a &s;piritual activity to &s;erve God and our neigh|bour, <HI>not by works, not of our&s;elves</HI>; but <HI>by grace,</HI> by mere favour; <HI>through faith,</HI> through &s;uch an entire confidence in our Phy&s;ician, as makes us gladly take his powerful remedies, ab&s;tain from the plea&s;ing poi&s;on of &s;in, and feed on tho&s;e di|vine truths, which communicate angelical vigor and happine&s;s to our &s;ouls. Eph. ii. 8.</P>
<P N="6">VI. INFER. If our nature is &s;o compleatly fallen and totally helple&s;s, that in &s;piritual things <HI>we are not &s;ufficient of our&s;elves to think any thing</HI> truly good <HI>as of our&s;elves, but our &s;uffi|ciency is of God</HI>; it is plain, we &s;tand in ab&s;olute

<P N="7">VII. INFER.

<P>In our catechi&s;m, they clearly di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween <HI>the outward vi&s;ible &s;ign or form in bapti&s;m,</HI> and <HI>the inward &s;piritual grace:</HI> And by defining the latter, <HI>a death unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> they declare that who&s;oever is not <HI>dead</HI> or dying <HI>to &s;in</HI> and <HI>alive to righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is not truly regenerate, and has nothing of bap|ti&s;m but the <HI>outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign.</HI> In the 27th of our articles they mention, that <HI>bapti&s;m is</HI> not the new birth, but <HI>a</HI> SIGN <HI>of regeneration or new birth, whereby, as by an in&s;trument, they who receive bapti&s;m rightly, are grafted into the church.</HI> And if our church returns thanks for the regeneration of the infants whom &s;he has
<PB N="182" REF="017930_0179_0FA37E0B7A11A190">
admitted to bapti&s;m, it is chiefly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>chiefly,</HI> becau&s;e our church gives thanks al&s;o for Chri&s;t's general grace and mercy to children, declaring her&s;elf <HI>per&s;uaded of the good-will of our heavenly Father towards this</HI> [unbaptized] <HI>infant,</HI> through Chri&s;t, who &s;aid, that <HI>of little children is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> The truth lies between the error of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> who &s;uppo&s;e that unbaptized infants are <HI>&s;inle&s;s</HI> like angels; and that of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who affirm that they are <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> as devils.</NOTE> upon a cha|ritable &s;uppo&s;ition, that they have <HI>received it rightly,</HI> and will, <HI>for their part, faithfully perform the promi&s;es made for them by their &s;ureties.</HI> If they refu&s;e to do it <HI>when they come of age,</HI> far from treating them as her regenerate children, &s;he denounces a general excommunication again&s;t them, and charges them <HI>not to come to</HI> her <HI>holy table, le&s;t Satan brings them, as</HI> he did <HI>Judas, to de&s;truction both of body and &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. INFER.

<P>Un&s;peakably dangerous then is the delu&s;ion of tho&s;e, who&s;e brains and mouths are filled with the notions and expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; while their poor, carnal, unrege|nerate hearts remain perfect &s;trangers to <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="183" REF="017930_0180_0FA37E0C4120B628">IX. INFER. If the corrupt nature which &s;inners derive from Adam, &s;pontaneou&s;ly pro|duces all the wickedne&s;s that over&s;preads the earth; the holy nature which believers receive from Chri&s;t, is al&s;o &s;pontaneou&s;ly productive of all the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, de&s;cribed in the oracles of God: <HI>Good works &s;pringing out</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is to be under&s;tood of a moral, and not of an ab&s;olute, irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity; for faith never un|mans the believer.</NOTE> NE|CESSARILY <HI>of a true and lively faith,</HI> Art. xii.</P>
<P>Such mini&s;ters therefore, as clearly preach our fall in Adam, and that faith in Chri&s;t which is productive of genuine holine&s;s and active love, will infallibly promote good works and pure morality: When tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t <HI>only</HI> upon works and moral duties, will neither be zealous of good works them&s;elves, nor in&s;trumental in turning &s;inners from their gro&s;s immoralities.

And thou wilt con|tinue the hazardous &s;port, till &s;in and wrath con&s;ume thee together. Nor will this be more &s;urprizing, than that one, who carries a bag of gun-powder, and knows not the dangerous na|ture of his load, &s;hould fearle&s;sly ru&s;h through

<P N="5">5. Ignorance of the my&s;tery of iniquity with|in you, mu&s;t, in the nature of the things, cau&s;e you to neglect prayer, or to pray out of charac|ter. As unhumbled morali&s;ts, in&s;tead of ap|proaching the throne of grace, with the &s;elf-aba&s;ement of the penitent Publican, &s;aying, <HI>God be merciful unto me a &s;inner:</HI> you will provoke the Mo&s;t High, by the open profanene&s;s of the Sadducee; or in&s;ult him by the &s;elf-conceited &s;ervices of the Phari&s;ee, boa&s;ting ye

is of no &s;ervice to you, but rather proves, to u&s;e St. Paul's nervous expre&s;&s;ion, the <HI>&s;avour of death unto death.</HI> For when the terrors of the law only &s;uit your ca&s;e, you vainly catch at the comforts of the go&s;pel; or rather, you remain as unaffected under the threatnings of the one, as under the promi&s;es of the other: You look on mount Sinai and mount Sion with equal in|difference, and the warmth of the preacher, who invites you to <HI>fly from the wrath to come,</HI> appears to you an in&s;tance of religious madne&s;s. Nor is it a wonder it &s;hould, while you conti|nue unacquainted with your danger: When a mortal di&s;ea&s;e is neither felt nor &s;u&s;pected, a pathetic addre&s;s upon its con&s;equences and cure, mu&s;t be received by any rea&s;onable man, with the greate&s;t unconcern; and the per&s;on that makes it in earne&s;t, mu&s;t appear exceed|ingly ridiculous.

<P N="7">7. <HI>My people are de&s;troyed for lack of knowledge,</HI> &s;ays the Lord. This is true, particularly with re|gard to the knowledge of our depravity. Reader! if thou remaine&s;t a &s;tranger to it, thou wilt look upon &s;light confe&s;&s;ions of outward &s;ins, as true repentance; and the <HI>godly &s;orrow that work|eth repentance to &s;alvation,</HI> will appear to thee a &s;ymptom of melancholy. Taking an external reformation of manners, or a change of ceremo|nies and opinions, for true conver&s;ion, thou wilt think thy&s;elf in a &s;afe &s;tate, while thy heart continues habitually wandering from God, and under the dominion of a worldly &s;pirit. In a word, &s;ome of the branches of the tree of cor|ruption thou may&s;t po&s;&s;ibly lop off, but the root will &s;till remain and gather &s;trength. For it is plain, that a bad root, &s;uppo&s;ed not to exi&s;t,

<P N="10">10. If it is a de&s;perate &s;tep to turn away from the Prince of life, it is a daring one to approach him with a mere compliment.

<P N="11">11. Some indeed, more con&s;i&s;tent than you, openly throw off the ma&s;k. Seeing neither the unfathomable depth of their mi&s;ery by the fall, nor the immen&s;e height of their aggravated ini|quities,

And if our guilt reaches not up to heaven, why &s;hould the Son of God have come down from thence, to <HI>put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. As we &s;light or reject the Saviour, till we are truly convinced of the evil and danger of &s;in; &s;o we wor&s;hip a fal&s;e god, a mere idol. For, in&s;tead of adoring Jehovah, infinite in his holine&s;s and hatred of &s;in, inviolable in the truth of his threatnings again&s;t it, and impartial in his &s;trict ju&s;tice&mdash;a God in who&s;e pre&s;ence unhum|bled &s;inners <HI>are not able to &s;tand,</HI> and <HI>with whom evil cannot dwell</HI>; we bow to a <HI>&s;trange god,</HI> whom pious men never knew&mdash;a god formed by our own fancy, &s;o <HI>unholy</HI> as to connive at &s;in, &s;o <HI>unju&s;t</HI> as to &s;et a&s;ide his mo&s;t righteous law, and &s;o <HI>fal&s;e</HI> as to break his &s;olemn word, that we mu&s;t <HI>turn or die,</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

<P N="13">13. We may go one &s;tep farther &s;till, and affirm, that till we are deeply convinced of &s;in, far from wor&s;hipping the true God, [which im|plies knowing, loving, and admiring him in all

his perfections] we hate and oppo&s;e him in his infinite <HI>holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI> The proof is obvi|ous: Two things diametrically oppo&s;ite in their nature, can never be approved of at once. If we do not &s;ide with divine holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, abhor our corruption, and condemn our&s;elves as hell-de&s;erving &s;inners; far from approving, we &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t the holy and righteous God, who &s;entences us to eternal death for our &s;in: We &s;hall at lea&s;t wi&s;h he were le&s;s pure and ju&s;t than he is; which amounts to wi&s;hing him to be no God. While proud fiends betray this horrid di&s;po&s;ition, by loud bla&s;phemies in hell; ye do it, O ye unconvinced &s;ons of men, by your aver&s;ion to godline&s;s upon earth. <HI>Haters of God,</HI> is then the proper name, and <HI>enmity again&s;t him,</HI> the &s;ettled temper of all unhumbled, unconverted &s;inners, Rom. i. 30. and viii. 7.</P>
<P N="14">14. When the nature of God is mi&s;taken, what wonder if his law is mi&s;apprehended? <HI>The law is good,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>if a man u&s;e it lawfully</HI>; but if we make an improper u&s;e of it, the con&s;equence is fatal. Since the fall, the law of God, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, points out to us the &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s, and inflexible ju&s;tice, of its divine Au|thor. It teaches us with what ardor and con|&s;tancy we &s;hould love both our Creator and our fellow-creatures. As a bank ca&s;t again&s;t the &s;tream of our iniquity, it accidentally &s;erves to make it ri&s;e the higher, and to di&s;cover its im|petuo&s;ity; for <HI>by the law is the knowledge of &s;in.</HI> It demon&s;trates man's weakne&s;s, who <HI>con&s;ents in|deed to the law that it is good, but finds not how to fulfil it,</HI> Rom. vii. 16, 19. As a battery erected again&s;t our pride, when it has its due effect, it &s;ilences all our &s;elf-righteous pleas, and con|vinces
<PB N="193" REF="017930_0190_0FA37E13B8A265D8">
us that a returning &s;inner <HI>is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Chri&s;t:</HI> a broken law, a <HI>law</HI> which <HI>worketh wrath,</HI> being ab&s;olutely unable to ab&s;olve its violator. &mdash; In a word, <HI>it is our &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t,</HI> and drives us with the rod of threatned puni&s;h|ments, to make us touch the &s;ceptre of mercy, held out to us from the throne of grace.</P>
<P>But, while we remain &s;trangers to our help|le&s;s and hopele&s;s &s;tate by nature, far from making this proper u&s;e of the law, we tru&s;t in it, and fancy that the merit of our un&s;prinkled obe|dience to it, is the way of &s;alvation. Thus we <HI>go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, making light of</HI> the atoning blood, which marks <HI>the new and living way</HI> to heaven. This very mi&s;take ruined the Phari&s;ees of old, and de&s;troys their numerous followers in all ages, Rom. ix. 31.</P>
<P N="15">15. And when we form &s;uch wrong appre|hen&s;ions of the <HI>law,</HI> is it po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have right views of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> and receive it with cordial affection? Rea&s;on and experience an&s;wer in the negative. What &s;ays the go&s;pel to &s;inners? <HI>You are &s;aved</HI> BY GRACE, through mere favour and mercy, <HI>not</HI> by the covenant <HI>of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t</HI> like the Phari&s;ee, Eph. ii. 8. Now, ye decent formali&s;ts, ye fond admirers of your own virtue, are you not utterly di&s;qualified to &s;eek and accept a pardon in a go|&s;pel way? For your &s;eeking it upon the footing of mere <HI>mercy,</HI> implies an acknowledgment, that you de&s;erve the ruin threatned again&s;t &s;inners. And &s;uppo&s;e a pardon were granted you, before you had a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your &s;ad de&s;erts, you could not receive it as an act of <HI>mere grace,</HI> but only as a reward ju&s;tly be&s;towed upon you for the merit of your works. It is plain then, that
<PB N="194" REF="017930_0191_0FA37E1479570420">
according to the go&s;pel plan, none can be fit &s;ubjects of &s;alvation, but tho&s;e who are truly &s;en&s;ible of their condemnation.</P>
<P N="16">16. But as the grace of God in Chri&s;t, is the original and properly meritorious cau&s;e of our &s;alvation: So the grand in&s;trumental cau&s;e of it is <HI>faith</HI> on our part. <HI>Through faith are ye &s;aved,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul.

<P>Thou art happily weary of feeding upon the hu&s;ks of earthly vanities. I have a right there|fore, as a &s;teward of the my&s;teries of God, to bring out of the divine trea&s;ury, the pearls of evangelical truth; and I gladly ca&s;t them before

<HEAD><HI>PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS</HI> on the nature and depth of penitential &s;orrow.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Thou knowe&s;t, that <HI>except thou</HI> truly <HI>re|pente&s;t, thou &s;halt</HI> &s;urely <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> and that there is no true repentance, where there is not true &s;or|row for &s;in. <HI>I rejoice,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul to the Co|rinthians, <HI>that ye were made &s;orry after a godly manner: For godly &s;orrow worketh repentance to &s;alvation, not to be repented of; but the &s;orrow of the world worketh death.</HI> Hence it appears, that there are two &s;orts of &s;orrow &s;pringing from oppo&s;ite &s;ources; <HI>God</HI> and <HI>the world</HI>; the one a <HI>godly &s;orrow,</HI> and the other <HI>the &s;orrow of the world.</HI> Learn to di&s;tingui&s;h them by their various cau&s;es and effects, &s;o &s;halt thou avoid the danger of mi&s;taking the one for the other.</P>
<P>The &s;orrow of the world, which many cover
<PB N="209" REF="017930_0204_0FA37D9C8BEDBDD0">
with the cloak of religion, ari&s;es from fear of con|tempt, dread of poverty, &s;ecret jealou&s;y, revenge di&s;&s;atisfied, love di&s;appointed, baffled &s;chemes, lo&s;&s;es in bu&s;ine&s;s, unkindne&s;s of friends, provo|cation of enemies, or the death of &s;ome idolized relative. Nay, this &s;orrow may &s;ometimes &s;pring from a mixture of &s;elf-righteous pride and &s;lavi&s;h fear. Some cannot bear to be robbed of their fond hopes of meriting heaven by their ima|ginary good works: They lo&s;e all patience, when they &s;ee their be&s;t righteou&s;ne&s;s brought to light, and expo&s;ed as <HI>filthy rags:</HI> They are cut to the heart, when they hear, that their ap|parent good deeds de&s;erve puni&s;hment as well as their black enormities: Or like condemned male|factors, they dread the con&s;equences of their crimes, while they feel little or no horror for the crimes them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Exceedingly fatal are the effects of this &s;or|row, in the per&s;ons whom it overcomes: Their indignant hearts, unable to bear either di&s;ap|pointment, contradiction, or condemnation, ri&s;e again&s;t &s;econd cau&s;es, or again&s;t the decrees of providence; fret at the &s;trictne&s;s of the law, or holine&s;s of the Lawgiver; and pine away with uninterrupted di&s;content. Hence, &s;purning at advice, direction, and con&s;olation, they wring their hands, or <HI>gnaw their tongues with angui&s;h</HI>; impatience works them up into &s;tupid &s;ullen|ne&s;s, or noi&s;y murmuring; they complain, that their <HI>puni&s;hment is greater than they can bear</HI>; and, imagining they are more &s;everely dealt with than others, they ha&s;tily conclude. <HI>Behold, this evil is from the Lord, why &s;hould I wait for him any longer?</HI> Thus black de&s;pair &s;eizes upon their &s;pirits; and, if grace does not interpo&s;e, they either live on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fill up the mea&s;ure of their

iniquities, as Cain, Pharaoh, and Haman; or madly lay violent hands upon them&s;elves, as Ahitophel, and Judas.</P>
<P>This &s;orrow cannot be too much guarded again&s;t, as it not only de&s;troys many per&s;ons, but does immen&s;e hurt to religion. For tho&s;e who are glad of any pretence to pour contempt upon godline&s;s, taking occa&s;ion from the in|&s;tances of this &s;orrow, harden their own hearts, and prejudice all around them again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed, <HI>godly</HI> &s;orrow, which every mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel endeavours to excite; maliciou&s;ly repre&s;enting it as one and the &s;ame with the mi&s;chievous <HI>&s;or|row of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Their mi&s;take will be evident, if we trace godly &s;orrow back to its &s;ource. It does not &s;pring merely from fear of puni&s;hment; but chiefly from humbling views of God's holine&s;s, the impurity of the human nature, the exceed|ing &s;infulne&s;s of &s;in, and the tran&s;cendent ex|cellency of the law, which condemns the &s;inner.</P>
<P>And this happy &s;orrow differs not le&s;s from the other in its effects, than it does in its cau&s;e. The per&s;ons who are ble&s;&s;ed with it, far from murmuring, or fretting at the divine command|ments, &s;ee it to be <HI>holy, ju&s;t, and good,</HI> both in its preceptive and penal part. They &s;o ab&s;o|lutely acquic&s;ce in it, that they would not alter it, if they could. They clear God, accu&s;e them&s;elves, &s;ub&s;cribe their own &s;entence, and ac|knowledge, <HI>It is of the Lord's mercies, that we are not con&s;umed.</HI> Each of them can &s;ay, <HI>Wherefore &s;hould a living man complain, a man for the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;ins? It is good that he &s;hould both hope, and quietly wait for God's &s;alvation: I will there|fore watch to &s;ee what he will &s;ay unto me, for he will &s;peak peace unto his people.</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="017930_0206_0FA37D9E0DED8958">
Thus in a con&s;tant u&s;e of all the ordinances of God, they meekly wait, wre&s;tling with their unbelieving fears, till victorious <HI>faith comes by hearing</HI> of the matchle&s;s love of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and then, <HI>fearing the Lord and his goodne&s;s,</HI> they <HI>&s;ing the &s;ong of the Lamb,</HI> and run upon his de|lightful errands.</P>
<P>As thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;erious reader, the nature, ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and excellence of <HI>godly &s;orrow,</HI> thou art probably de&s;irous of being informed, how deep thine mu&s;t be, to con&s;titute thee a <HI>true</HI> penitent. Know then, that it mu&s;t be deep enough to im|bitter thy mo&s;t plea&s;ing, profitable, and ha|bitual &s;ins, and to prevent thy re&s;ting without a clear &s;en&s;e of thy peculiar intere&s;t in Chri&s;t.&mdash; It mu&s;t be profound enough to make him and his go&s;pel infinitely precious to thee, and to pro|duce, under God, the ble&s;&s;ed effects mentioned in the fifth part of the preceding treati&s;e.</P>
<P>To be more particular, a true penitent may certainly without de&s;pair or madne&s;s, go as far in godly &s;orrow, as David does in his peniten|tial p&s;alms, or our church in the fir&s;t part of the homily on fa&s;ting.
<Q>When good men, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> feel in them&s;elves the heavy burden of &s;in, &s;ee damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell, they tremble, they quake, they are inwardly touched with &s;orrowfulne&s;s of heart for their offences, and cannot but accu&s;e them&s;elves, and open their grief unto Almighty God, and call on him for mercy. This being done &s;e|riou&s;ly, their mind is &s;o occupied, partly with &s;orrow and heavine&s;s, partly with an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all de&s;ire of meat and drink is laid a&s;ide, and loathing of all worldly

things and plea&s;ures comes in place, &s;o that they like nothing better than to weep, to la|ment, to mourn, and both with words and be|haviour of body, to &s;hew them&s;elves weary of this life.</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that godly &s;orrow needs not be equal, either in degree or duration, in all penitents. Tho&s;e, who&s;e hearts, through divine grace, open as readily and gently as that of Lydia, happily avoid many of David's pangs and Job's terrors. The powerful and in|&s;tantaneous, or the gentle and gradual manner, in which &s;ouls are awakened; the difference of con&s;titutions; the peculiar &s;ervices that a few are called to, and for which they are prepared by peculiar exerci&s;es; the horrid aggravations that have attended the &s;ins of &s;ome; and the &s;evere correction, which the Lord is obliged to give others, for their &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t his grace&mdash;all this may help us to account for the various depths of di&s;tre&s;s, through which differ|ent penitents pa&s;s in their way to Chri&s;t and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The Lord does not needle&s;sly afflict the chil|dren of men, any more than a tender father un|nece&s;&s;arily corrects his di&s;obedient children: He only wants us to for&s;ake our &s;ins, renounce our own imaginary righteou&s;ne&s;s, and come to Chri&s;t to be made partakers of his merits, holi|ne&s;s, and felicity. The &s;orrow, which an&s;wers the&s;e ends, is quite &s;ufficient; though it &s;hould be ever &s;o light, and of ever &s;o &s;hort a duration.

Con&s;ider that they are committed by a worm of earth, again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of heaven; and they will all appear to thee infinitely great: e&s;pecially if thou mea&s;ure&s;t them, and thy&s;elf by the true rule, the oracles of God; ca&s;ting away the three fal&s;e &s;tandards which &s;elf-deceivers mea&s;ure them&s;elves by, namely, the good opinion of their worldly-minded neighbours, the defect|ive examples of their fellow-&s;inners, and the flattering &s;ugge&s;tions of their own blind &s;elf-love.</P>
<P>Follow the example of <HI>the noble Bereans: Search the &s;criptures daily, whether the&s;e things are &s;o,</HI> Acts xvii. 11. View in that faithful mir|ror, the picture both of the natural and of the regenerate man, and a&s;k thy con&s;cience which thou re&s;emble&s;t mo&s;t.

<P>To this meditation, add a frequent &s;urvey of the follies of thy childhood, the vanity of thy youth, the worldly-mindedne&s;s of thy riper years, the capital tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which con&s;ci|ence accu&s;es thee of, and the <HI>hardne&s;s of heart,</HI> and <HI>alienation from the life of God,</HI> that the &s;crip|tures charge thee with.

<P>Frequently reflect, how total mu&s;t be our lo&s;s of &s;piritual life, which cannot be repaired but by a <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> a <HI>new birth,</HI> or <HI>a new crea|tion,</HI> Col. iii. 1.

<P>In the mean time, improve the daily oppor|tunities, which thou ha&s;t of &s;tudying human corruption in the life and tempers of all around thee, but chiefly in thy own carele&s;s and deceit|ful heart: Take notice of its pride and &s;elf-&s;eeking, of its ri&s;ings and &s;ecret workings, e&s;pe|cially when unexpected temptations trouble thy imaginary peace of mind: For, at &s;uch a time, thy corruption, like the &s;ediment in the bottom of a vial that is &s;haken, will &s;hew its loath&s;om|ne&s;s and &s;trength.</P>
<P>Conver&s;e frequently, if thou can&s;t, with per|&s;ons deeply convinced of &s;in. Attend a plain,

heart-&s;earching mini&s;try as often as po&s;&s;ible; and when the &s;word of the Spirit, the word of God, pierces thy &s;oul, beware of fretful impatience. In&s;tead of ri&s;ing with indignation again&s;t the preacher, and &s;aying, as proud Ahab did to the man of God, <HI>Ha&s;t thou found me, O mine enemy?</HI> account him thy be&s;t friend, that wounds thee deepe&s;t, provided he brings thee to Chri&s;t for a cure: And when the arrows of the word fly abroad, drop the &s;hield of unbelief, make bare thy brea&s;t, welcome the ble&s;&s;ed &s;haft, and re|member, that the only way of conquering &s;in, is to fall wounded and helple&s;s at the Redeemer's feet.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the impre&s;&s;ions of the word will &s;oon wear off, if thou do&s;t not importunately intreat the Searcher of hearts, to light the candle of his grace in thy &s;oul, that thou maye&s;t clearly &s;ee whether thy <HI>inward parts</HI> are <HI>holine&s;s to the Lord,</HI> as thou fondly &s;uppo&s;e&s;t; or <HI>very wicked|ne&s;s,</HI> as the &s;cripture te&s;tifies.

<P>This <HI>light,</HI> it is true, <HI>&s;hineth in darkne&s;s,</HI> but frequently <HI>the darkne&s;s comprehendeth it not.</HI> That this be not thy dreadful ca&s;e, do not <HI>grieve</HI> and <HI>quench the</HI> convincing <HI>Spirit,</HI> by per&s;i&s;ting in the <HI>wilful</HI> omi&s;&s;ion of any duty, or <HI>deliberate</HI> com|mi&s;&s;ion of any &s;in: Nothing but <HI>ob&s;tinate unbe|lief</HI> darkens the mind, and hardens the heart, more than this.

<DIV2 TYPE="cautions">
<HEAD><HI>CAUTIONS,</HI> Proper for a penitent, who de&s;ires to make his calling and election <HI>SURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="3">III. When thou ha&s;t affecting views of thy lo&s;t e&s;tate, beware of re&s;ting like Felix in &s;ome pangs of fear, fits of trembling, and re&s;olutions of turning to God by and by, <HI>when</HI> thou <HI>&s;halt have a convenient &s;ea&s;on.</HI> Neither give place to de&s;ponding thoughts, as if there was no appeal from the tribunal of ju&s;tice to the throne of grace.</P>
<P>Run not for ea&s;e to vain company, bodily indulgence, entangling affections, immoderate &s;leep, exce&s;&s;ive drinking, or hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Cain built a city</HI> to divert his trouble of mind, and multitudes like him, by <HI>the cares of this world, the deceitfulne&s;s of riches, or the de&s;ire of other things,</HI> daily <HI>choak</HI> the good &s;eed, the preci|ous <HI>word</HI> of conviction, Mark iv, 19.</P>
<P>Be not &s;atisfied with faint de&s;ires of living the life of the righteous, or idle wi&s;hes of dying their death. Remember that <HI>the de&s;ire of the &s;lothful kills him:</HI> and if thou ha&s;t experienced &s;ome drawings of grace, meltings of heart, or breathings after God; &s;it not down at la&s;t, as the Laodiceans, in a carele&s;s &s;tate, <HI>neither hot nor cold.</HI> It is far better to go on thy way
<PB N="218" REF="017930_0213_0FA37DA43A00E850">
weeping, and &s;eeking <HI>the pearl of great price</HI> till thou really find it, than to re&s;t contented with an ha&s;ty conceit that thou art po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, when thou art not.</P>
<P>Stop not in an outward reformation, and a form of godline&s;s, like many, who mi&s;take the <HI>means</HI> or <HI>doctrines of grace</HI> for grace it&s;elf; and becau&s;e they &s;ay their heartle&s;s prayers both in public and private, or go far and often to hear the go&s;pel preached in its purity, fondly hope, that they are the favourites of God, and in the high way to heaven.</P>
<P>Under pretence of increa&s;ing thy convictions, do not bury them in heaps of religious books. Some read till their heads are confu&s;ed, or their hearts <HI>pa&s;t feeling.</HI> Thus, though <HI>ever learning, they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Hear</HI> then, as well as <HI>read</HI> the word of life; but think not thy&s;elf converted when thou ha&s;t <HI>received it with joy:</HI> The &s;tony-ground hearers went as far as this: <HI>Herod</HI> him&s;elf <HI>heard John gladly, honoured him, did many things,</HI> but left the mo&s;t important undone; for he never di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ince&s;tuous woman he lived with; and at la&s;t &s;acrificed to her revenge, the hone&s;t preacher he once admired.</P>
<P>Do not confound the <HI>covenant of works</HI> made with <HI>innocent</HI> Adam <HI>before</HI> the fall, and the <HI>co|venant of grace</HI> made with <HI>&s;inful</HI> Adam <HI>after</HI> the fall, Gen. ii. 17. and iii. 15. and Rom. v. 11.&mdash;21. They are excellent in their place, but when they are mixed together, they de&s;troy each other's efficacy. The dreadful thunders, heard in paradi&s;e lo&s;t; and the melodious &s;ongs uttered in paradi&s;e regained, do not &s;trike <HI>at once</HI> the &s;ame &s;piritual ear. The galling yoke of the law of works, and the heavy load of its con|demnation
<PB N="219" REF="017930_0214_0FA37DA4EDC66DF8">
are dropt; when we take upon us Chri&s;t's ea&s;y yoke, and &s;ubmit to his light bur|den. In a word, the fir&s;t Adam gives place to the &s;econd when we <HI>find re&s;t unto our &s;ouls.</HI> Let then the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> of the law of innocence, be &s;wal|lowed by the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of the go&s;pel: or rather, let it make way for the grace of Chri&s;t in thy &s;oul, as an emetic makes way for a cordial in a di&s;ordered &s;tomach. If thou take&s;t them to|gether, their re&s;pective u&s;e is prevented. The fir&s;t covenant lo&s;es its <HI>humbling</HI> efficacy, and the &s;econd its <HI>re&s;torative</HI> power. Therefore, if thou ha&s;t really <HI>received the &s;entence of death in thy&s;elf</HI>; leave the cur&s;e of the fir&s;t covenant in the grave of Chri&s;t, <HI>crucified for thy &s;ins</HI>; and welcome the pardoning, renovating grace of Chri&s;t, <HI>ri&s;en again for thy ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, re&s;t not contented with &s;peculative knowledge, and unaffecting, though clear ideas of the go&s;pel-way of &s;alvation. Light in an unrenewed under&s;tanding, mi&s;taken for the <HI>my&s;tery of faith in a pure heart,</HI> like an ignis fatuus, or fal&s;e light, leads thou&s;ands through the bogs of &s;in into the pit of de&s;truction, Acts viii. 13.</P>
<P>Pacify not thy con&s;cience by activity in out|ward &s;ervices, and a warmth in God's cau&s;e: Party &s;pirit, or natural &s;teadine&s;s in carrying on a favourite &s;cheme, yea, or &s;eeking thy own glory, may be the &s;prings that &s;et thee on work. Jehu faithfully de&s;troyed Baal and Jezebel, but his zeal for the Lord covered the &s;ecret de&s;ire of a crown. Take care al&s;o not to mi&s;take gifts for graces; fluency of &s;peech for convert|ing power, the warmth of natural affection for divine love; or an impul&s;e of God's Spirit, on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion, for an evidence of

<P>Avoid the &s;elf-conceit of many, who feed on the corrupted manna of their pa&s;t experiences, and confidently appeal to the wa&s;ted &s;treams of tho&s;e con&s;olations, which once refre&s;hed their hearts; when, alas! it is evident, <HI>they have</HI> now <HI>for&s;aken the fountain of living water,</HI> and <HI>hewn to them&s;elves broken ci&s;terns that held no water</HI>; un|le&s;s the mire of evil tempers, &s;elfi&s;h views, and heartle&s;s profe&s;&s;ions of faith, may pa&s;s for <HI>the &s;treams which gladden the city of God.</HI></P>
<P>Neither do thou heal thy&s;elf by touches of &s;orrow, by tears, good de&s;ires, or outward marks of humiliation for &s;in, as king Ahab. Nor by exce&s;&s;ive fa&s;ting, retiring from bu&s;ine&s;s, or hard u&s;age of the body, as many Roman Catholics: nor yet by mi&s;applying the doctrine of prede&s;ti|nation, and &s;etting down notions of election for evidences of &s;alvation, as many Prote&s;tants: No, nor by <HI>doting about que&s;tions, &s;trifes of words, and perver&s;e di&s;putings, which eat as a canker,</HI> as &s;ome in St. Paul's days, and too many in ours, 1 Tim. vi. 4.</P>
<P>To conclude, think not thou art ab&s;o|lutely made whole when the power of outward &s;in is weakened or &s;u&s;pended, when thou ha&s;t learned the language of Canaan, can&s;t &s;peak or write well on &s;piritual &s;ubjects, art intimately acquainted with the be&s;t mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and ha&s;t ca&s;t thy lot among the de&s;pi&s;ed chil|dren of God, taken their part, &s;hared in their reproach, and &s;ecured their e&s;teem and prayers.

faith; becau&s;e it chiefly grew from the &s;eed of prejudice and education, as the faith of Jews and Turks; and not from the &s;eed of divine grace and power, as the faith of St. Paul, Gal. i. 15. and becau&s;e it never yielded the heavenly fruits which <HI>go&s;pel faith</HI> infallibly produces: Such as&mdash;<HI>a vital union with Chri&s;t,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. <HI>The pardon of &s;ins,</HI> Col. i. 14.

<P>Be not afraid of this conviction of unbelief; for it generally goes before divine faith, as the fermentation of a grain of corn in the earth, is previous to its &s;hooting its &s;talk towards heaven. <HI>God concludes,</HI> &s;huts us up <HI>in unbelief,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>that he may have mercy upon</HI> us, Rom. xi. 32. <HI>When the comforter is come,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>he will convince the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not in me.</HI> This is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which peculiarly de&s;erves the name of <HI>&s;in,</HI> as being the <HI>damning</HI> &s;in according to the go&s;pel, Mark xvi. 16. the &s;in that binds upon us the guilt of all our other iniquities, and keeps up the power of all our corruptions.

<P>A conviction of this &s;in is of the utmo&s;t im|portance, as nothing but an affecting &s;en&s;e of its heinou&s;ne&s;s and power, can make us entirely

weary of our&s;elves&mdash;nothing but a &s;ight of its de&s;tructive nature can prevent our re&s;ting with|out a compleat cure.</P>
<P>But when thou art once convinced of unbe|lief, do not increa&s;e the difficulty of believing, by imagining true faith at an immen&s;e di&s;tance. Con&s;ider it as very near thy heart.

<P>Whence ari&s;e, O poor &s;inner, thy back|wardne&s;s and mi&s;givings?

<P>In a little wrath, and for a &s;mall moment, I have hid my face from thee; but with ever|la&s;ting kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee; for I am the Lord thy Redeemer. Believe it, and faith will work by love, and love will ca&s;t out fear: Thus &s;halt thou take hold of my &s;trength, that thou may&s;t make peace with me, and thou &s;halt make peace with me; for I am a &s;trength to the needy in his di&s;tre&s;s, an hiding-place from the wind, a covert from the tempe&s;t, as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the &s;hadow of a great rock in a weary land.</P>
<P>Come then, be not of them that draw back from me to perdition, but of them who be|lieve to the &s;aving of the &s;oul. Far from ca&s;t|ing away thy little confidence, which hath great recompence of reward, hold it fa&s;t; re|&s;i&s;t even unto blood, &s;triving again&s;t the damn|ing

<P>Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which thou ha&s;t done, but according to my mercy I &s;aved thee. I am the Lamb &s;lain from the founda|tion of the world.

&s;word, and declares, <HI>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: They are ju&s;tified from all things, and freely forgiven all tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI>&mdash; And now thou art more than conqueror through him that loved thee. Standing by humble faith in his omnipotence, thou can&s;t do all things, through his grace &s;trengthening thee. Sin has no dominion over thee: The cruel and bloody tyrant, that reigned unto death, is dethroned; and grace, rich grace, &s;weetly reigns through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life. Triumphing in Chri&s;t over thy fierce&s;t enemies, and putting thy victorious foot upon the neck of the <HI>last,</HI> thou challenge&s;t his utmo&s;t rage, and &s;houte&s;t,
<Q>O Death, where is thy &s;ting? O Grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</Q></P>
<P>Now thou &s;ee&s;t and feele&s;t that God is LOVE. Thou dwelle&s;t in Him, and He in thee. <HI>Love,</HI> the fulfilling of the law, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through all thy heart, influences thy looks, words, and actions, and makes thee &s;pring after Je&s;us in the chariot of cheerful obedience: Thy heart is as his heart; and while active grace draws thy willing &s;oul along, God's free Spirit pours the oil of gladne&s;s upon the &s;ervid wheels of thy affections: Supported, and animated by the Lord's pre&s;ence, thou &s;wiftly move&s;t, thou de|lightfully flie&s;t in all the ways of duty: Mount|ains of difficulties &s;ink into plains before thee; wi&s;dom's roughe&s;t ways are ways of plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, and all her paths are peace.</P>
<P>Now thou rejoice&s;t to be thought worthy to &s;uffer &s;hame for Chri&s;t's name, and counte&s;t it all joy, when thou falle&s;t into divers trials. With him the cro&s;s lo&s;es its dreadful a&s;pect and

<P>Chri&s;t crucified works this miracle of grace, for Him thou receive&s;t with every cro&s;s; and the moment thou do&s;t &s;o in the power of his Spirit, God, even thy own God, gives thee his choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ing: He crowns thee with loving-kindne&s;s and tender mercies; and with the in|expre&s;&s;ible complacence of a Father, who re|ceives a lo&s;t &s;on; with the triumphant joy of a Saviour, who embraces a rai&s;ed Lazarus; He &s;ays to the myriads that &s;urround his throne:

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX,</HI> Concerning the evangelical harmony that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween living faith and loving obedience.</HEAD>
<P>THE my&s;tery of our &s;alvation is thus opened by St. Paul, <HI>By</HI> GRACE <HI>are ye &s;aved, through faith, which</HI> WORKETH <HI>by love.</HI> This apo&s;tolic declaration &s;ubdivides it&s;elf into the following propo&s;itions, which, on account of their clearne&s;s and importance, may, with propriety, be called GOSPEL AXIOMS. 1. <HI>Ye are &s;aved by</HI> GRACE. 2. <HI>Ye are &s;aved through a faith which</HI> WORKS <HI>by love.</HI> The&s;e propo&s;i|tions, like two adamantine pillars, &s;upport the whole doctrine of Chri&s;t, concerning <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works; grace</HI> and <HI>rewardablene&s;s</HI>; or <HI>mercy</HI> on God's part, and <HI>obedience</HI> on our own:&mdash;A doctrine, which, though clear as the day, has neverthele&s;s been &s;o ob&s;cured by endle&s;s contro|ver&s;ies, that thou&s;ands of Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts know it in its purity no more.</P>
<P>According to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e axioms, all that go to heaven, give divine <HI>grace</HI> the glory of their &s;alvation; becau&s;e they are all &s;aved by mere favour, through the redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And according to the <HI>&s;econd</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="017930_0261_0FA37DC99B642D30">
axiom, all that go to hell, are obliged to clear divine <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> becau&s;e they are condemned merely for their avoidable unbelief, and ob&s;tinate di&s;|obedience. Upon this evangelical plan, the righteous are <HI>graciou&s;ly</HI> rewarded, and the un|righteous <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> puni&s;hed: The doctrines of God's <HI>mercy,</HI> in giving grace for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and of man's <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> in u&s;ing it bv Chri&s;t's help, &s;weetly coincide; and from their ble&s;&s;ed union &s;prings the ju&s;t proportion of every part of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The&s;e axioms are &s;o &s;trongly maintained, and &s;o frequently alluded to by the &s;acred writers, that whoever rejects either the one or the other, might as well reject one half of the bible. At|tentively con&s;ider them a&s;under, and your un|prejudiced rea&s;on will perceive their <HI>equity.</HI> Im|partially compare them together, and in&s;tead of finding them incompatible, (as &s;ome prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed per&s;ons would per&s;uade us they are) you will &s;ee, that they <HI>harmonize</HI> in &s;o exqui&s;ite a manner, as to an&s;wer the mo&s;t excellent ends in the world.</P>
<P>To give you an idea of their working in the brea&s;t of believers, permit me to compare them to tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite, and yet con&s;entaneous motions of the heart, which anatomi&s;ts call <HI>dia&s;tole</HI> and <HI>&s;y&s;tole.</HI> The one forcibly dilates, the other powerfully contracts, that noble part of the human body; and both together, by means &s;eemingly contrary, cau&s;e the circulation of the blood, and diffu&s;e vital powers through all the animal frame. &mdash;Ju&s;t &s;o pa&s;&s;ive <HI>faith,</HI> and active <HI>love.</HI>&mdash;The one perpetually <HI>receives</HI> favours from God, the other perpetually <HI>be&s;tows</HI> them upon man; and thus, by continually performing their
<PB N="267" REF="017930_0262_0FA37DCADC755EB0">
contrary (not contradictory) offices, they make &s;piritual life circulate through the believer's &s;oul, and enable him to diffu&s;e kindne&s;s and good works throughout the &s;ocial body, of which he is a member.</P>
<P>From the animal, pa&s;s we to the planetary world; and we &s;hall &s;ee another &s;triking em|blem of the harmonious oppo&s;ition, which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts between the two go&s;pel axioms. There we eminently di&s;cover the <HI>centripetal</HI> and the <HI>centrifugal</HI> force. Though oppo&s;ed to each other, they are neverthele&s;s &s;o admirably joined together, that from their exqui&s;ite combination, re&s;ults the harmonious dance of the &s;pheres; I mean, the circular motion of the planets around the &s;un, and around each other.&mdash;Such is the wonderful effect of <HI>evangelical promi&s;es,</HI> and <HI>legal precepts,</HI> when they meet in a due pro|portion in an upright heart. The <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> which are all wrapped up in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> go&s;pel axiom, powerfully <HI>draw</HI> believers to Chri&s;t, who is the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the cen|ter of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem: The <HI>precepts,</HI> which the <HI>&s;econd</HI> axiom nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, drive them forward in the &s;trait line of duty. Being thus delightfully attracted, and powerfully impelled, like planets of a different magnitude, in the fir|mament of the church, believers rapidly move in the orb of evangelical obedience, where the <HI>original</HI> light of Chri&s;t warmly &s;hines into their own &s;ouls, and their <HI>borrowed</HI> light mildly gleams upon their fellow-mortals.</P>
<P>If ever you &s;aw a per&s;on, thus &s;wiftly and evenly moving in the immen&s;e circle of reli|gious and &s;ocial duty; freely receiving all from his God, and freely imparting all to his neigh|bour;
<PB N="268" REF="017930_0263_0FA37DCAFAA57168">
you have &s;een one of the <HI>&s;tars in the Lord's right hand</HI>&mdash;you have &s;een one, who prac|tically holds the two go&s;pel axioms&mdash;one, who <HI>believes</HI> as a &s;inner, and <HI>works</HI> as a believer&mdash;one, in who&s;e heart the doctrines of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works, free grace</HI> and <HI>free obedience, divine faithfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>human fidelity,</HI> are ju&s;tly balanced&mdash;one, who keeps at an equal di&s;tance from the dreadful rocks, upon which <HI>Antinomian believers,</HI> and <HI>An|ti-chri&s;tian workers,</HI> are daily ca&s;t away&mdash;In a word, you have &s;een an adult Chri&s;tian, a man who <HI>adorns the doctrine of Chri&s;t our Sa|viour in</HI> ALL <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>If the two go&s;pel axioms are of &s;uch im|portance, that the health and vigour of every Chri&s;tian, flow from the proper union of their power in his heart; is it not deplorable to &s;ee &s;o many people every where ri&s;ing again&s;t them? <HI>Self-conceited morali&s;ts</HI> violently attack the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> axiom; and <HI>&s;elf-humbled &s;olifidians</HI> will give the <HI>&s;econd</HI> no quarter. Tho&s;e oppo&s;ed a&s;&s;ailants have all, I grant, a zeal for God, but not ac|cording to knowledge; for the <HI>former</HI> know not, that they rob God of <HI>his glory</HI>; and the <HI>latter</HI> do not con&s;ider, that they pour upon him <HI>our &s;hame.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> refu&s;e to acknowledge him the <HI>grand author</HI> of our <HI>bli&s;s:</HI> The <HI>other,</HI> to mend the matter, repre&s;ent him as the <HI>grand contriver</HI> of our <HI>ruin.</HI> Both, neverthele&s;s, have truth on their &s;ide; but alas! it is only <HI>a part</HI> of the truth as it is in Je&s;us; and truth divided, like an animal cut through the middle, is dread|fully mangled, if not entirely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, judicious reader, that as a ju&s;t proportion of &s;ail and bal|la&s;t, next to a favourable wind, makes a &s;hip
<PB N="269" REF="017930_0264_0FA37DCBBAE23418">
&s;ail with &s;peed and &s;afety; &s;o the ju&s;t balance of the two go&s;pel axioms, next to the Spirit of God, makes a believer run &s;wiftly and &s;afely the race that is &s;et before him. He does not properly <HI>run,</HI> he merely <HI>hops</HI> in the way of truth, who, di&s;carding one of the go&s;pel axioms, moves only upon the other. <HI>Antinomian Laodiceans</HI> there|fore, and <HI>Anti-chri&s;tian Phari&s;ees,</HI> are equally blameable. For the piety of the <HI>former</HI> &s;tands only upon the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> axiom; and the devotion of the <HI>latter</HI> has no other ba&s;is than the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> will hear of nothing but faith; the <HI>other</HI> will be told of nothing but <HI>works.</HI> But the <HI>&s;ound</HI> believer is for a <HI>faith</HI> that <HI>works</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Faith unfeigned,</HI> and <HI>obedient love,</HI> are of equal importance to the true Chri&s;tian. Tho&s;e pre|cious graces, which an&s;wer to the go&s;pel axioms, like a well proportioned pair of heavenly &s;teeds, mutually draw the &s;teady chariot of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion acro&s;s the valleys of di&s;couragement, and over the hills of difficulty, which he meets with in his way to heaven. If I might carry on the allegory, I would ob&s;erve, that all the advan|tage, which the right hand &s;teed has over the other, is, that it is <HI>fir&s;t</HI> put in the traces: But this is no proof of his &s;uperiority, for he will be taken off at the gate of heaven; and <HI>obedient love</HI> alone, &s;hall have the honour of drawing the Chri&s;tian's triumphal car through the realms of glory.</P>
<P>Reader, if in the theory and practice you maintain both go&s;pel axioms; if, in&s;tead of &s;etting up the one in oppo&s;ition to the other, you &s;tand upon the &s;criptural line in which they harmonize; you have &s;urmounted the greate&s;t
<PB N="270" REF="017930_0265_0FA37DCC8409D428">
difficulty there is in the Chri&s;tian religion; you hold <HI>the faith once delivered unto the &s;aints.</HI> And now, prepare to <HI>contend for it:</HI> Arm your|&s;elf for the fight; for <HI>Antinomian believers</HI> will attack you on the <HI>left</HI> hand, and <HI>Phari&s;aic un|believers</HI> on the <HI>right.</HI> But be not afraid of their number; patiently receive their double fire. They may gall one <HI>another,</HI> but they cannot hurt <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truth</HI> is great, and <HI>Love</HI> powerful; if you fight under their glorious banners, tho' the ar|rows of contempt, and the brands of calumny, will fly thick around you, you &s;hall not be dan|gerou&s;ly wounded. Only <HI>take the &s;hield of faith,</HI> with this motto, '<HI>By grace I am &s;aved through faith</HI>; and <HI>quench with it the fiery darts</HI> of &s;elf-conceited legali&s;ts. <HI>Put on the brea&s;t-plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> with this in&s;cription,
<Q>Faith works by righteous love, the mother of good works:</Q>
This piece of cele&s;tial armour, will keep off the heavie&s;t &s;trokes of <HI>&s;elf-humbled go&s;pellers.</HI> And animated by the Captain of your &s;alvation, through the oppo&s;ite forces of tho&s;e adver&s;aries, urge your evangellically-legal way, till you ex|change <HI>the &s;word of the Spirit</HI> for a <HI>golden harp,</HI> and your daily cro&s;s for an heavenly crown.</P>
<P>Such is the happy medium, that the author of this book de&s;ires to recommend. Some time ago, he thought him&s;elf obliged to oppo&s;e good mi&s;taken men, who, in their zeal for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> go&s;pel axiom, wanted to repre&s;ent the <HI>&s;econd</HI> as a 'dreadful here&s;y.' And now he lets the&s;e papers &s;ee the light, not only to prove to the free thinkers of his pari&s;h, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> axiom is highly rational; but to convince the enemies of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> axiom, that, though he has expo&s;ed
<PB N="271" REF="017930_0266_0FA37DCD3A42A088">
their mi&s;takes with regard to <HI>works,</HI> he receives the <HI>genuine</HI> doctrines of grace as cordially as they; and is ready &s;cripturally, and rationally, to defend &s;alvation by <HI>faith,</HI> again&s;t: the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objections of &s;elf-righteous morali&s;ts.</P>
<P>He ju&s;t begs leave to ob&s;erve, that the pre|ceding pages guard the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> go&s;pel axiom; that the <HI>Four Checks to Antinomiani&s;m,</HI> guard chiefly the &s;econd; that <HI>the Equal Check to Phari&s;ai&s;m and Antinomiani&s;m,</HI> guards both at once; and that tho&s;e tracts contain a little &s;y&s;tem of prac|tical and polemical divinity, which, it is hoped, &s;tands at an equal di&s;tance from the errors of moral di&s;believers, and immoral believers.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> book is chiefly recommended to di&s;be|lieving morali&s;ts, who deride the doctrine of &s;alvation by grace <HI>through faith</HI> in the day of conver&s;ion, merely becau&s;e they are not properly acquainted with our fallen and lo&s;t e&s;tate. And the <HI>Checks</HI> are chiefly de&s;igned for di&s;believing Antinomians, who ri&s;e again&s;t the doctrine of a believer's &s;alvation by grace <HI>through</HI> the <HI>works</HI> of faith in the great day, merely becau&s;e they do not con&s;ider the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of evan|gelical obedience, and the nature of the day of judgment.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the carele&s;s, &s;elf-conceited &s;in|ner is awakened, and humbled. In the <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> the &s;erious, humbled &s;inner, is rai&s;ed up, and comforted. And in the <HI>Checks,</HI> the fooli&s;h vir|gin is re-awakened, the Laodicean believer re|proved, the prodigal &s;on la&s;hed back to his Fa|ther's hou&s;e, and the upright believer animated to mend his pace in the way of <HI>faith working by love,</HI> and to <HI>perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God.</HI></P>
