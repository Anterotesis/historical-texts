<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ADULTERY is become &s;o fa&s;hionable, and Divorces &s;o frequent, that it may ad|mit of &s;ome debate in the polite world whether the fir&s;t is criminal or the latter di&s;honourable: the law, however, judiciou&s;ly puni&s;hes the one and &s;tigmatizes the other.</P>
<P><HI>Advowtry,</HI> which in the old law-book &s;ignifies adultery, is the &s;in of incontinence between two married per&s;ons; but if only one of the per&s;ons be married, it is, neverthele&s;s, adultery. In this la&s;t ca&s;e, however, it is called &s;imple adul|tery, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other which is compound. This crime was &s;everely puni&s;hed by the laws of God, and the antient laws of the land. The Julian law among the old Romans made it death; but in mo&s;t countries (as is the ca&s;e in England) it is at this period puni&s;hed by fine, and in others by bani&s;hment. According to the law made by William the Conqueror, who|ever, forced a Woman &s;hould lo&s;e his genitals, the offending parts. Before the &s;tatute of the 22d Charles II. which made malicious maim|ing felony, it was a que&s;tion, whether cutting off the privy members of a man taken in adultery with another man's wife was felony or not? as an in&s;tance of which, in the thirteenth year of
<PB N="iv" REF="011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88">
Henry III. one <HI>John</HI> a monk, being taken by Henry Hull in the act with his wife, he cut off the privy-members, of the monk, and was only indicted for a <HI>maheim,</HI> or maiming.</P>
<P>Hence it plainly appears that the &s;tatute enact|ed in the reign of that amorous prince, Charles the Second, who doubtle&s;s had an eye therein to the very bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion, hath wonderfully propagated and &s;ecured the honourable, noble, (I had almo&s;t &s;aid royal) practice of perform|ing the drudgery of matrimonial duty; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e the knight errants of tho&s;e, or the pre&s;ent times, however valorous in e&s;pou&s;|ing the cau&s;es, and the protection of their mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es, would have cho&s;en &s;o publickly (as they have &s;ince done) to manife&s;t their abilities in in|trigues of this kind, had they run the ri&s;k of legally lo&s;ing tho&s;e very <HI>important</HI> parts, which would ever after have di&s;qualified them from entering the li&s;ts of gallantry. I &s;hall not even &s;cruple to &s;uppo&s;e that his R. H. notwith&s;tanding the many di&s;gui&s;es he took upon him&s;elf, and conde&s;cen&s;ions he &s;ubmitted to, would have per|&s;evered either in his intrigue, or his <HI>elegant</HI> cor|re&s;pondence (which was &s;o immediately the means of detection) had not his whole per&s;on (which certainly includes tho&s;e parts) been <HI>&s;acred,</HI> and had he not been convinced that the greate&s;t damages that could happen to him, would be only i&s;&s;uing a little more money out of the T&mdash;y, either for <HI>&s;ecret</HI> &s;ervices or publick law-&s;uits <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide the Damages obtained by Mr. Wilkes again&s;t Lord Hallifax, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> (as in &s;imilar <HI>ca&s;es</HI>) which might, indeed, terminate
<PB N="v" REF="011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88">
in an additional tax upon <HI>any thing</HI> left <HI>untaxed,</HI> or a new Stamp Act <HI>properly modified</HI> to <HI>quiet</HI> the minds of the people of North America.</P>
<P>As to her Lady&s;hip &s;he &s;eemed re&s;olved at all events to imbibe the &s;ublime &s;entiments inherent in r&mdash;l blood; as either &s;he had, or was very near having a &s;imilar connexion with the late duke of Y&mdash;k before his departure for the con|tinent, and which was &s;o generally talked of, that at length it was imparted to Lord Gro&mdash;r, and a &s;eparation had then nearly taken place up|on that account; but upon her promi&s;ing his Lord&s;hip in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner that &s;he would never again &s;peak to <HI>that</HI> R. H. in <HI>private,</HI> he forgave her. Indeed, her Lady&s;hip may plead &s;omething in her excu&s;e, be&s;ides her fond|ne&s;s for an alliance with r&mdash;l blood; as it is well known that her marriage was not a match of her own choice; but &s;trongly recommended to her by her parents. An anecdote is handed about of her fir&s;t acquaintance with his Lord&s;hip, which is as follows: Lord G&mdash; had in his youth led a very debauched life, and had almo&s;t de|&s;troyed his con&s;titution, by a certain di&s;ea&s;e which is never communicated but by the ladies; his phy&s;icians therefore advi&s;ed him, as the only means of pre&s;erving the &s;mall &s;hare of health that he remained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, to marry: he ac|cordingly re&s;olved to marry the fir&s;t woman of family that was agreeable to him, without paying any regard to fortune. Ju&s;t as he had come to this re&s;olution, he was walking one day in Ken|&s;ington gardens, whil&s;t his coach was waiting for him at the gate, and a &s;hower of rain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="vi" REF="011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470">
on, he took &s;helter in the &s;ame alcove where Mi&s;s V&mdash;n (his pre&s;ent lady) and her &s;i&s;ter <HI>Carry</HI> had retired for &s;helter. After &s;ome com|mon conver&s;ation upon the weather, and other general topicks, he a&s;ked the ladies, if they had not a carriage at hand, to do him the honour of taking part of his; which, with very little in|treaty, they con&s;ented to, as it was likely to be a rainy evening. His Lord&s;hip was at fir&s;t-&s;ight &s;truck with Mi&s;s V&mdash; and was only waiting for an opportunity of &s;aying a civil thing to her, when upon the road Mi&s;s V&mdash; declaring,
<Q>&s;he thought his Lord&s;hip's coach was the ea&s;ie&s;t &s;he ever rode in;</Q>
he replied
<Q>he was very happy at its meeting with her approbation; and that &s;he might be mi&s;tre&s;s of it whenever &s;he plea&s;ed.</Q>
She blu&s;hed, without making any reply, which he con&s;trued into a favourable omen; and the next day he applied to her rela|tions to obtain their con&s;ent to pay his addre&s;|&s;es to Mi&s;s V&mdash;. So great a match highly flattered her mother's ambition; and &s;he prevail|ed on Mi&s;s V&mdash; to give his Lord&s;hip her hand, though &s;he then declared he was very di&s;agree|able to her; add to this, her mother, who, on account of her employment in the prince&s;s Ame|lia's hou&s;hold, &s;trove upon every occa&s;ion to &s;hew the greate&s;t re&s;pect to all the r&mdash;l family, con&s;tantly recommended to her daughter <HI>never to refu&s;e any thing</HI> the K&mdash;'s brother reque&s;ted;&mdash; which lady G&mdash;r has mo&s;t <HI>dutifully obeyed.</HI> This &s;he may, at lea&s;t, plead as &s;ome excu&s;e to her relations; but it is a moot point whether it is &s;o good a one as what F&mdash;te made for her to lady
<PB N="vii" REF="011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470">
H&mdash;r&mdash;n &s;ome weeks &s;ince, when he was taking chocolate with her.&mdash;
<Q>Good heaven, &s;aid her lady&s;hip, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that lady G&mdash;r &s;hould prefer the D&mdash; of C&mdash; to lord G&mdash;!</Q>
<Q>not at all, my Lady, <HI>replied the wag,</HI> for his R. H. is only <HI>Dis&mdash;</HI> but his L&mdash;p is <HI>DEATH</HI> it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>Now we have introduced F&mdash;te we &s;hall al&s;o introduce a few more of his <HI>bon mots</HI> up|on this occa&s;ion. He &s;aid the other day,
<Q>the pre&s;ent K&mdash; had created Sir Richard G&mdash;r a <HI>Lord,</HI> and his brother had created him a <HI>Cuc|kold</HI>; dignities &s;omewhat &s;imilar according to the pre&s;ent times; and the more &s;o as they had both tipt his head with gold, the fir&s;t his <HI>coronet,</HI> the la&s;t his <HI>horns.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His R. H. a&s;ked F&mdash;te, the la&s;t time he dined with him at North-End, what he thought about his Letters that were read in court.&mdash;
<Q>Think, plea&s;e your H&mdash;s, (&s;aid Sam) it is impo&s;&s;ible to think about them, as you never once thought when you wrote them.</Q></P>
<P>His R. H. told F&mdash;te, a &s;hort time &s;ince, in great confidence,
<Q>That Lady G&mdash;r was one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible women in England; and that he &s;hould one day or other &s;ee her Letters.</Q>
The day after the trial this genius &s;aid,
<Q>I am convinced of what your R. H. &s;aid.&mdash;She is a damn'd &s;en&s;ible woman as to <HI>parts</HI>; but it was left for a man of your H&mdash;s's penetration to di&s;cover her genius.</Q>
The &s;ame great mimic ob&s;erved,
<Q>That in &s;everal parts of the country a certain per&s;o|nage, in the cour&s;e of his intrigue, was taken,
<PB N="viii" REF="011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8">
by his di&s;gui&s;e in a black wig, for a hor&s;e|&s;tealer and a highwayman; but no where for a <HI>conjurer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted that this cour&s;e of cor|re&s;pondence was not the fir&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;pi|cion: for that lord G&mdash;, having &s;urpri&s;ed a packet with one of the D&mdash; of C's curious epi&s;tles ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his Lady, which Mrs. Reda the mil|lener, oppo&s;ite St. Alban's-&s;treet, Pall-mall, was bringing to her immediately after her lying-in, or at lea&s;t before &s;he had been abroad; his Lord|&s;hip had the great good nature, upon her Lady|&s;hip's a&s;&s;uring him that nothing had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her and the D&mdash; but indi&s;cretions of the lea&s;t vicious kind, not only to forgive her, but a&s;&s;ure her, that if &s;he gave him no cau&s;e for future di&s;content, the di&s;covery he <HI>had made</HI> &s;hould never be public, nor go farther than be|tween him and her. But the interception of the fir&s;t letter annexed rekindled all his re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>The Editor of the&s;e &s;heets has taken the earlie&s;t opportunity of laying them before the public, as this is the mo&s;t important and remark|able Trial that ever came before a court of judi|cature; and the only one that has any &s;imilarity to it, fell out in the la&s;t century, when Robert earl of Southe&s;k charged his R. H. James duke of York (afterwards James II.) with an amour with his counte&s;s; but it was never brought into court: nor is there, perhaps, any precedent in any country of a like proce&s;s; and though no more than 10,000l. damages were granted, it evidently demon&s;trates the integrity and up|right
<PB N="ix" REF="011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8">
&s;entiments of a Briti&s;h jury, who pay no regard to rank, title, or &s;tation, but ad|mini&s;ter ju&s;tice with equal impartiality, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t &s;ubject in the land. His lord&s;hip has thereby obtained all he de&s;ired by this verdict,&mdash;a divorce; and had he received ten times the damages he would have applied it in the like manner he pro|po&s;es doing the&s;e, by di&s;tributing them to the mo&s;t u&s;eful and beneficial public charities. So little temptation, indeed, has money in the eyes of his Lord&s;hip, that it is confidently a&s;&s;erted that 50,000l. were offered from a certain quarter, to &s;top the pro&s;ecution, but nobly refu&s;ed by his Lord&s;hip.</P>

<P>It was contended by the coun&s;el for the defendant, that the laying the damage at 100,000<HI>l.</HI> was exce&s;&s;ive and immoderate; but to this it was an&s;wered, that, in the reign of Charles the Second, much higher damages were &s;ued for by the then Duke of York, again&s;t one Pilkington, a Sheriff of the city of Lon|don, in an action of <HI>&s;candalum magnatum,</HI> in the King's Bench, and a verdict of 100,000<HI>l.</HI> was ob|tained in his favour; and it was farther urged, that when the injury was done to an inferior, that circum|&s;tance alone greatly aggravated the offence.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedderburn, in the cour&s;e of opening the cau&s;e, &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on the ca&s;e becoming more criminal on account of the rank of the defendant: This he in&s;tanced in two ca&s;es; the fir&s;t was that of Lord Belvidere in the kingdom of Ireland, who&s;e bro|ther (Mr. Rochford) having crim. con. with his lady, his lord&s;hip obtained 20,000<HI>l.</HI> damages, tho' the de|fendant's fortune was no way an&s;werable to &s;uch a &s;um. The other was a ca&s;e of defamation brought by James II. when Duke of York, again&s;t a trade&s;|man in the city, when the damages were likewi&s;e laid high: "And the&s;e, continued the learned coun&s;el, were given for very &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons; to &s;hew &s;o|ciety,
<PB N="13" REF="011898_0007_0F874B301DB84AA8">
that where particular duty and re&s;pect is re|quired, an action of criminality becomes doubly &s;o, when the&s;e ties are broke through.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedderburn then methodically &s;tated the facts. He &s;et forth, that his R. H. in his excur&s;ions to Towce&s;ter in Northampton&s;hire, Coventry, Mar|court-Hill, Whitchurch in Shrop&s;hire, Che&s;ter, and St. Alban's, in order to meet Lady G&mdash;r, a&s;&s;um|ed, at different times, the names of 'Squire Morgan, 'Squire Jones, the Farmer, &amp;c. that he &s;ometimes appeared as a young 'Squire di&s;ordered in his &s;en&s;es, and u&s;ed to be called at the inns the Fool, particu|larly at Whitchurch, where a noi&s;e being heard in pa&s;&s;ing from one room to the other, it was di&s;regarded by the people of the hou&s;e, who &s;aid it was only the Fool; and that he had taken down with him to St. Alban's a &s;ervant, who went by the name of Tru&s;ty, for the purpo&s;e of carrying on his intrigue with great|er &s;ecurity: That they had witne&s;&s;es to prove, that Lady G&mdash; was &s;everal times carried to the back door of the D. of C's hou&s;e in the Park, where &s;he went in, and &s;taid for a con&s;iderable time. That &s;e|veral of Lord G&mdash;'s &s;ervants went down to St. Alban's with his Lord&s;hip's brother, who, upon breaking open the door at the inn, found the D. of C. &s;itting on the bed-&s;ide along with lady G&mdash;, with his wai&s;tcoat loo&s;e, and the lady with her Dre&s;den unbuttoned, and her brea&s;ts wholly expo&s;ed; that on their entering, her lady&s;hip made towards the door of communication with the next room, but in the attempt fell; on which he, who was left to guard the door they entered by, went to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which his R. H. availed him&s;elf of, and run out, calling on them, when he got on the other &s;ide of the door, "to take notice, he was not found in the room; and that he would take his Bible oath, he was not."</P>
<P>But Mr. Wedderburn &s;aid, previous to his calling &s;everal witne&s;&s;es to prove this, and many other im|portant facts, he &s;hould read to the court &s;everal let|ters
<PB N="14" REF="011898_0008_0F874B3122264770">

<P>His lord&s;hip meeting with one of his &s;ervants, near Che&s;ter, going with a letter from his Lady to put into the po&s;t, &s;topt him to go upon another errand, taking the letter, and &s;aying he would put it in him&s;elf: he then had the curio&s;ity to open it, which he found to be the fir&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See p. 22.</NOTE> letter from Lady G&mdash; to his R. H. when, after having taken a copy of it, he put it into the po&s;t, and intercepted all the re&s;t.</P>

<P>I Sent a letter la&s;t night but fear you could not receive it while on &s;hore, but I hope it wd not be long getting to you, I hope you are perfectly well, and have had a good voyage &s;o farr.</P>
<P>he appears rather in better temper to day, &s;o I'm in great hopes he did not get enough of the Letter to make out much he &s;tayed out very late la&s;t night which seems to have occa&s;ioned a <HI>weezing</HI> to day, by the means of my Si&s;ters I think I can &s;end and receive my Letters very safe for the future. Carry is out of Town for a few days so in the mean time I &s;end them by another Si&s;ter who comes to &s;ee me every day, and she thinks it &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s I have with Reda about some Milenary that I dont chuse he &s;hould know of so if &s;he gets ever a Letter for me she knows &s;he is not to take it out of her pocket till we are alone &s;o its all cleverly &s;ettled again at present, how miserable I should have been if we could not have contrived to hear from one another, I quite live only upon the thoughts of its not being a great while before I have the happine&s;s of a Letter from you, for I'm very &s;ure you'll write as &s;oon as you can, I know your tender|ne&s;s for me well enough to be certain of that,&mdash;</P>

<P>he seems in a tolerable humour not much one way nor other but still drinks toa&s;t &amp; water and very little wine he had a little weazing last night, I suppose dining out to day wont do him much good he sais as the weather is so cold he could get off his busine&s;s in Wales, but I realy believe he is very glad of any excuse to carry him there as he dont seem to know what to do with him&s;elf at home</P>
<P>I do believe &amp; hope there is no suspicions about you, &amp; indeed tho painful I'm &s;ure to both of us I really beleive it was the mo&s;t prudent thing posible to go before people talked or began to suspect; nothing here has happened worth relating, I've Breakfa&s;t'd din'd &amp; sup't gone to bed &amp; rise at the same hour as u&s;ual but we rehearst our play in my Room the other night, I fancy it will be done middling well its a most horrid play but they will have it, I mu&s;t act both the womens characters we are not to have the general Rehearsal in the Playhouse till Monday evening&mdash; indeed my dear &s;oul you are very prudent in intend|ing to go a little in publick before I come to town, it wou'd really look much too particular just to come out then &amp; might cause remarks which po&s;&s;ibly might be conveyed to my Ld. &amp; every thing of that sort might rouse him &amp; make him more and more ob|servant to prevent our Meetings, and the best thing we can po&s;sibly do now is to make him believe it is

God forbid there should be a Warr if you go what then remains for me but misery, dont lets think on that, no, its wrong, one must not meet misfortunes, but how can I talk so, I'm sure that is not adopting the Style I before proposed to look forward for better times&mdash;I shall long to hear from you my dear life, indeed I do, I am afraid you had a miserable Journey indeed, I hope C&mdash; will manage our letters as you send, if she wont dont be uneasy I'll certainly contrive some other means to write and to hear from you&mdash;I shall write to C&mdash; as soon as I've done this &amp; per&s;uade her all I can, I really think no body can suspect any thing as you said&mdash;so if you send to her the Thurs|day after you get this you'll find another from me, I think I have better now conclude and write my letter to C&mdash; as I imagine he will come home pretty soon, or I could write to you for ever, indeed my dearest Soul I could tire you to death with my non|sense&mdash;I shall only now add what I have often said to you my Deare&s;t Friend, that you may ever be a&s;|&s;ured of my tendere&s;t &amp; most sincere affections &amp; that I shall ever remain in the truest sense of the ex|pre&s;sion</P>

<P>He a&s;ked (as the words <HI>mutual feelings</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Letter III. and Letter XII.</NOTE>, and
<Q>I hope I &s;hall never have occa&s;ion to <HI>repent</HI> this con|fidence,</Q>

Or, why the word <HI>repent</HI> &s;hould be u&s;ed, if it did not &s;trongly imply a foregone di&s;honour?" He ob&s;erv "That it would be given the Jury in evidence that his R&mdash; H&mdash; had a&s;&s;umed the fictitious name of <HI>Morgan,</HI> a country 'Squire, not very <HI>&s;ound</HI> in his <HI>un|der&s;tanding</HI>; that he had taken down a &s;ervant with him to St. Alban's, who went by the name of <HI>Tru&s;ty,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of facilitating this amour." He there|fore a&s;ked, "What pain of mind it mu&s;t co&s;t his R&mdash; H&mdash;, for one of his elevated &s;tation to a&s;&s;ociate him&s;elf for &s;everal days with his own &s;ervant, pa&s;s un|der a fictitious name, and forego all tho&s;e honours and di&s;tinctions u&s;ually paid to his rank, if he had not this di&s;honourable &s;cheme in pur&s;uit?"</P>
<P>After fini&s;hing the&s;e ob&s;ervations, which were made with great accuracy and judgment, he told the Jury, "That they had two principal objects for their ob&s;ervation. The fir&s;t was the very great quality of the defendant, and the &s;econd the irreparable injury &s;u&s;tained by the plaintiff. As to the former, he &s;aid, no given &s;um could be puni&s;hment &s;ufficient, as the elevated rank and &s;ituation of life he &s;u&s;tained, &s;hould the more deter him from &s;etting a bad example to the &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety." He ob&s;erved, "There were certain &s;ituations in life, that made the &s;ame offence more criminal in one than another, on account of the greater duties they may owe the offended party in particular, or &s;ociety in general. This he in|&s;tanced in the ca&s;e of a &s;ervant pro&s;ecuted for <HI>crim. con.</HI> with his ma&s;ter's wife, when the damages were
<PB N="43" REF="011898_0022_0F874B3FD87AF7C0">
laid very con&s;iderable, though the offending party had no fortune to bear it; and this he &s;aid was done for very wi&s;e purpo&s;es; to point out to &s;ociety the great|er breach of duty in a &s;ervant, from whom confidence, re&s;pect, and fidelity, were more immediately expect|ed." He ob&s;erved, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, tho' the da|mages may be thought to be laid high, yet, as it was all the puni&s;hment the law could inflict, none of it ought to be remitted, as they had it now in their power to convince his R&mdash; H&mdash; in particular, and every man of rank in general, "That the laws of England in the hands of a BRITISH Jury, are al|ways &s;uperior to &s;ituation and connections. He like|wi&s;e hoped, that this would, in future, direct his R. H. to nobler pur&s;uits than the &s;eduction of the wife of a Peer, and incline him to copy from a very near relation of his (meaning his M.) who&s;e conjugal at|tachments, ab&s;tracted from his other virtues, not on|ly ornamented the throne he filled, but &s;hewed a bright example to his &s;ubjects in general."</P>
<P>And now, gentlemen, continued the learned and eloquent Coun&s;el, I &s;hall leave you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;entiments, and only direct one thing more to your con&s;ideration; which is, that you have now be|fore you the cha&s;tity and honour of the &s;ex, the &s;anc|tity of marriage, and the cu&s;tody of Briti&s;h morals, and that your determination will &s;everally operate on each of the&s;e."</P>

That when the witne&s;s made the young '&s;quire's bed the next morning, it was mo&s;t exceedingly tumbled, &s;o as &s;he never &s;aw any bed that had been lain in only by one per&s;on, and there were &s;he did not know how many pins in the bed.

That this witne&s;s took an opportunity in the evening to bore two holes in the door of the bed-chamber his lady had made choice of, and &s;topped them with paper.

That the door broke at the hinges, and not at the lock; and the fir&s;t object he &s;aw was lady G. endeavouring to e&s;cape into the next room; in doing &s;o, &s;he fell down; that this witne&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to get up.

<P>The&s;e witne&s;&s;es being examined, the Coun&s;el for the Plaintiff gave the reply, which la&s;ted a full hour, and in one part particularly created a great laugh in ob&s;erving, "That however aggravating the circum|&s;tances were otherwi&s;e, they could not charge his R. H. with intriguing merely for the &s;ake of intrigue, as the <HI>incoherency</HI> of his letters plainly proved him to be really a lover."</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield began about half an hour after &s;ix, and, with his u&s;ual clearne&s;s, &s;ummed up the proof

with the utmo&s;t &s;trictne&s;s and impartiality, and con|cluded with &s;aying, "That the jury were to con&s;ider the damages received, and give an adequate recom|pence to the per&s;on injured, and not give a &s;um as a puni&s;hment upon the per&s;on who committed that in|jury. As in that ca&s;e, it would become rather a fine, which would be incroaching on the power of the court, in who&s;e brea&s;t the inflicting fines alone depends."</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip's &s;peech continued till fifteen minutes before eight, when the jury inclo&s;ed till ten minutes before ten, when, of the three complaints, they found the defendant only guilty of one, and then &s;et off in carriages for Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare, with their verdict, finding for the plaintiff TEN THOUSAND POUNDS damages.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the jury at Lord Mansfield's, in Bloom&s;bury-&s;quare, a number of people, who&s;e curio&s;ity was very great, had collected together round the door; and before the jury had well got into the hou&s;e, many ru&s;hed in with them, Lord Mansfield being acquainted with the arrival of the jury, he came into the hall from his room, by a private door; and being attended by the proper officers of the Court, the u&s;ual que&s;tions were a&s;ked, whether they were agreed in their verdict, and who &s;hould &s;peak for them? when he received their verdict, and imme|diately withdrew. Some of the people, who were neare&s;t the door, after having heard the verdict, com|municated it to others; and a loud huzza was heard, as approbatory of the jury's conduct.</P>
