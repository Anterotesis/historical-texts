<P>ONE Rea&s;on which moved me to write and Print this little Book, was, Becau&s;e, tho' there are many excellent Heart-affect|ing Di&s;cour&s;es in the World, that tend to convert the Sinner: yet I had a De&s;ire to my this &s;imple Method of mine; Wherefore I make bold thus to invite and incourage the Wor&s;t to come to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for Life.</P>
<P>I have been Vile my&s;elf, but have obtained Mercy, and I would have my Companions in Sin partake of Mercy too, &amp; therefore I have writ this BOOK.</P>
<P>The Nation doth &s;warm with vile Ones now, as ever it did &s;ince it was a Nation. My Book in &s;ome places can &s;carce go from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, but twill find a &s;uitable Sub|ject to &s;pread it &s;elf upon.

<P>THE whole Ver&s;e runs thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>And that repentance, and remi&s;|&s;ion of Sins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations, Be|ginning at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The words were &s;poken by Chri&s;t after he ro&s;e from the Dead, and they are here rehear&s;ed after an Hi&s;torical manner, but do contain in them a formal Commi&s;&s;ion, with a &s;pecial <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> therein.

is in &s;pecial mention'd by <HI>Luke,</HI> who &s;aith, That as Chri&s;t would have the Doctrine of Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins preach|ed in his Name among all Nations, &s;o he would have the People of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to have the fir&s;t proffer thereof, <HI>preach it,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>in all Nations; but begin at Jeru|&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles then thought they had a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;o large as to give them War|rant to go and preach the Go&s;pel in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the World, yet by this <HI>Clau&s;e</HI> they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> limited, as to the beginning of their Mi+ni&s;try; They were to begin this Work a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Beginning at Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed to an Ob&s;ervation up+on the Words, I mu&s;t (but briefly) touc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon two things: Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. Shew you what <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> now wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P N="2">2 Shew you what it was to preach the Go&s;pel to them.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t, <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is to be con&s;idere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of, either,</P>
<P N="1">1. With re&s;pect the de&s;cent of her Peo+ple. Or,</P>

<P N="3">3. With re&s;pect to her pre&s;ent State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to her Decays.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to her <HI>De&s;cent</HI>: She was from <HI>Abraham,</HI> from the Sons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Peo+ple that God &s;ingled out from the re&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="3" REF="003637_0004_10023A3CDDD8B388">
the Nations to &s;et his Love upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to her Preference or Exal|tation, &s;he was the place of God's Wor&s;hip, and that which had in and with her the &s;pecial Tokens and Signs of God's Favour and Pre&s;ence, above any other People in the World. Hence the Tribes went up to <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> to wor&s;hip, there was God's Hou&s;e; God's High Prie&s;t, God's Sacrifices accep|ted, and God's Eye, and God's Heart per|petually, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 76.1, 2. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 122.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1 Kings 9.3. But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We are to con&s;ider <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> al|&s;o in her Decays; for as &s;he is &s;o con&s;idered, &s;he is the proper Object of our Text, as will be further &s;hewed by and by.</P>
<P><HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as I told you, was the place and &s;eat of God's Wor&s;hip, but now decay|ed, degenerated, and apo&s;tatized. The Word, the Rule of Wor&s;hip, was rejected of them, and in its place they had &s;et up their own Traditions, they had rejected al&s;o the mo&s;t weighty Ordinances, &amp; put in the room thereof their own little things (<HI>Mat.</HI> 15. <HI>Mark</HI> 7.) <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was therefore now greatly back &s;lidden, and become the place where Truth and true Religion was much defaced.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o now become the very &s;ink of Sin, the &s;eat of Hypocri&s;ie, &amp; the Gulf where true Religion was drowned: Here al&s;o now reigned Pre&s;umption and ground|le&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="003637_0005_10023A39A5CC3560">
Confidence in GOD, which is the bane of Souls. Among&s;t its Rulers, Doctors and Leaders, Envy, Malice, &amp; Bla&s;phemy vented it &s;elf again&s;t the Power of Godli|ne&s;s, in all places where it was e&s;pied: As al&s;o again&s;t the Promoters of it; yea their Lord and Maker could not e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was now become the Shambles, the very Slaughter-&s;hop for Saints. This was the place wherein the Prophets, Chri&s;t, and his People, were mo&s;t horribly per&s;ecuted and murdered. Yea, &s;o hardned at this time was <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in her Sins, that &s;he feared not to commit the bigge&s;t, and to bind her &s;elf by Wi&s;h, under the Guilt and damning Evil of it; &s;aying, when &s;he had murdered the Son of God, <HI>His blood be upon us and our Children.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> did both by Doct|rine, Miracles, and Holine&s;s of Life, &s;eek to put a &s;top to their Villanies; yet they &s;hut their Eyes, &s;top their Ears, and re&s;ted not, till (as was hinted before) they had driven him out of the World. Yea that they might, if po&s;&s;ible, have extingui&s;hed his Name, and exploded his Doctrine out of the World; they again&s;t all Arguments, and in de&s;pite of heaven, its mighty Hand, and undeniable Proof of his Re&s;urrection; did hire Souldiers to invent a lye, &s;aying, <HI>his Di&s;ciples &s;tole him away from the Grave</HI>; on purpo&s;e that Men might not count him

the Saviour of the World, nor tru&s;t in him for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</P>
<P>They were, &s;aith <HI>Paul,</HI> contrary to all Men: For they did not only &s;hut up the Door of Life again&s;t them&s;elves; but forbid that it &s;hould be opened to any el&s;e. <HI>For|bidding us,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>to preach to the Gen|tiles, that they might be &s;aved, to fill up their Sin always, Mat.</HI> 23.35. <HI>Chap.</HI> 15 7, 8, 9. <HI>Mark</HI> 7.6, 7, 8. <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. <HI>to</HI> 9. <HI>John</HI> 8.33, 41. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27.18. <HI>Mark</HI> 3.30. <HI>Luke</HI> 2.65. <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.37. <HI>Luke</HI> 13.33, 34. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2.22, 23. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4.10. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27, 25. <HI>Ch.</HI> 20.11, <HI>to the</HI> 15.1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2, 14 15 16.</P>
<P>This is the City, and the&s;e are the Peo|ple, this is their Character, and the&s;e are their Sins. Nor can there be produced their parallel in all this World. Nay, what World, what People, what Nation, for Sin and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, could, or can be com|pared to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>! E&s;pecially if you ioyn to the matter of Fact, the Light they &s;in|ned again&s;t, and the Patience which they abu&s;ed. Infinite was the Wickedne&s;s up|on this Account which they committed.</P>
<P>After all their Abu&s;ings of wi&s;e Men, &amp; Prophets, God &s;ent unto them <HI>John Bap|ti&s;t,</HI> to reduce them, and then his Son to redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but per&s;ecuted both to the Death.

<P>And now to come to this <HI>Clau&s;e, Be|ginning at Jeru&s;alem</HI>: That is, that Chri&s;t would have <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> have the fir&s;t offer of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="1">1. This cannot be &s;o commanded, be|cau&s;e they had any more Right for them|&s;elves thereto&punc; than had any of the Nations of the World; for their Sins had dive&s;ted them of all Self-de&s;ervings.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor yet, becau&s;e they &s;tood upon the <HI>advance Ground</HI> with the wor&s;t of the Sin|ners of the Nations, Nay, rather the Sin|ners of the Nations, had the <HI>advance Ground</HI> of them: For <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was long before &s;he had added this Iniquity to her Sin, wor&s;e than the very Nations that God ca&s;t out before the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 33.</P>
<P N="3">3. It mu&s;t therefore follow that the <HI>clau&s;e begun at Jeru&s;alem</HI> was put into this Com|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="003637_0007_10023A42CB37FE78">
of meer Grace and Compa&s;&s;ion: Even from the overflowing of the Bowels of Mercy: For indeed they were the wor&s;t, and &s;o in the mo&s;t deplorable Condition of any People under the Heaven.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore their Relation was to <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> or <HI>Jacob,</HI> however they formerly had been the People among whom God had placed his Name and Wor|&s;hip; they were now degenerated from God more than the Nations were from their Idols, and were become Guilty of the highe&s;t Sins which the People of the World were capable of committing. Nay none can be capable of committing of &s;uch un|pardonable Sins they committed again&s;t their God, when they &s;lew his Son, and per&s;ecuted his Name and Word.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Words therefore, thus ex|plained, we gain this Ob&s;ervation,</P>
<P>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t would have Mercy offer'd in the fir&s;t place to the bigge&s;t Sinners.</P>
<P>That the&s;e <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Sinners were the bigge&s;t that ever were in the World, I think none will deny, that believes that Chri&s;t was the be&s;t Man that ever was in the World, and al&s;o was their Lord God. And that they were to have the fir&s;t offer of his Grace, the Text is as clear as the Sun; for it &s;aith, <HI>Begin at Jeru&s;alem.

<P><PB N="9" REF="003637_0007_10023A42CB37FE78">One would have thought, &s;ince the <HI>Je|ru&s;alem Sinners</HI> were the wor&s;t, and great|e&s;t Sinners, Chri&s;t's greate&s;t Enemies, and tho&s;e that not only de&s;pi&s;ed his Per&s;on, Doctrine, &amp; Miracles, but that a little be|fore had had their Hands up to their El|bows in his Hearts Blood.

<P>But we will proceed.

<P>Mercy &s;eems to be out of its proper Channel when it deals with Self righteous Men; but then it runs with a full Stream, when it extends it &s;elf to the bigge&s;t Sinners. As God's Mercy is not regulated by Man's Goodne&s;s, nor obtained by Man's Worthi|ne&s;s

And to this our Text agrees, when it &s;aith, <HI>Beginning at Jeru&s;alem:</HI> Let the <HI>Jeru|&s;alem &s;inner,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, have the fir&s;t Offer, the fir&s;t Invitation, the fir&s;t tender of my Grace and Mercy, for he is the bigge&s;t Sin|ner, and &s;o has mo&s;t Need thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us would have Mer|cy offered in the fir&s;t place to the bigge&s;t Sinners, becau&s;e when they or any of them receive it, it redounds mo&s;t to the Fame of his Name.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as you may perceive, has put him&s;elf under the term of a Phy&s;ician, a Doctor for curing of Di&s;ea&s;es: And you know that Applau&s;e and a Fame, is a thing that Phy&s;icians much de&s;ire.

<P>I am per&s;waded, did Men believe that there is that Grace &amp; Willingne&s;s in the Heart of Chri&s;t to &s;ave Sinners, as the Word imports there is, they would come tumbling into his Arms: But Satan has blinded their Minds, they cannot &s;ee this thing, How|beit the Lord Je&s;us has, as I &s;aid, that o|thers take Heart and come to him, given out a Commandment that Mercy &s;hould in the fir&s;t place be offered to the bigge&s;t Sinners. <HI>Begin</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And thus I end the third Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t would have Mer|cy offered in the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> to the bigge&s;t Sinners, <HI>Becau&s;e that is the way if they receive it, mo&s;t to weaken the Kingdom of Satan, and to keep it lowe&s;t in every Age of the World</HI>: The bigge&s;t Sinners they are Satan's <HI>Colonels,</HI> and <HI>Captains,</HI> the Leaders of his People, and they that mo&s;t &s;toutly make head again&s;t the Son of God.

to work Iniquity, and <HI>dexterous</HI> to manage others in the &s;ame, then is his Kingdom weak. (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.) Therefore I &s;ay, Chri&s;t doth offer Mercy, in the fir&s;t place to &s;uch, the more to weaken his Kingdom. Chri&s;t Je&s;us was glad to &s;ee Satan fall like Light|ning from Heaven, that is, &s;uddenly or headlong; and it was &s;urely, by ca&s;ting of him out of &s;trong Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and by reco|vering of &s;ome notorious Sinners out of his Clutches, <HI>(Luke</HI> 1.17, 18, 19.)</P>
<P><HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> when he would pull down the <HI>Phili&s;tians</HI> Temple, took hold of the two main Pillars of it, and breaking them, down came the Hou&s;e. Chri&s;t came to de&s;troy the works of the Devil, and to de&s;troy by converting Grace, as well as by redeeming Blood. Now Sin &s;warms, and lieth by Legions and whole Armies, in the Souls of the bigge&s;t Sinners, as in Garri&s;ons: Wherefore the way, the mo&s;t direct way to de&s;troy it is fir&s;t to deal with &s;uch Sin|ners, by the Word of his Go&s;pel, and by the Merits of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For Example, tho' I &s;hall give you but a homely one, Suppo&s;e a Family to be very Lou&s;ie, and one or two of the Family to be in chief the Breeders, the way, the quicke&s;t way to clear that Family, or at lea&s;t to weaken the &s;o &s;warming of tho&s;e Vermin, is in the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> to &s;weeten the Skin, Head, and Cloathes of <HI>chief Breed|ers.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="003637_0024_10023A76730E5BB8">
And then, tho' all the Family &s;hould be apt to breed them, the Number of them and &s;o the greatne&s;s of that Plague there will be the more impaired.</P>
<P><HI>Why there are &s;ome People that are in chief the</HI> Devils Sin-breeders <HI>in the Towns and places where they live; the Place Town or Family where they live mu&s;t needs be horrible Lou&s;ie, and as it were eaten up with</HI> Vermin; <HI>now let the Lord Je&s;us in the fir&s;t place clean&s;e the&s;e great Breeders, and there will be given a Nip to tho&s;e &s;warms of Sins that u&s;e to be committed in &s;uch places thro' out the Town, Hou&s;e, or Family where &s;uch</HI> Sin-breeding <HI>Per&s;ons u&s;e to be.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;peak by Experience, I was one of tho&s;e Lou&s;y ones; one of the&s;e great <HI>Sin-breeders</HI>; I infected all the Youth of the Town, where I was born with all manner of youthful Vanities. The Neighbours counted me &s;o, my practi&s;e proved me &s;o; Wherefore Chri&s;t Je&s;us took me fir&s;t, and taking me fir&s;t, the Contagion was much allayed all the Town over When God made one &s;igh, they would hearken, and inquiringly &s;ay, <HI>What's the matter with</HI> John? They al&s;o gave their various Opi|nions of me, but as I &s;aid, Sin cooled and failed, as, to its full Carreer; and when I went out to &s;eek the Bread of Life, &s;ome of them would follow, and the re&s;t be put

<P>But what need I give you an In&s;tance of poor I? I will come to <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> the King: So long as he was a ring leading Sinner, the great Idolater, aad chief for Devili&s;m, the whole Land flowed with Wickedne&s;s; <HI>for he made them to &s;in,</HI> and do wor&s;e than the Heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was ca&s;t out from before them. But when God con|verted him, the whole Land was reformed&punc; Down went the Groves, the Idols and Alters of <HI>Baal,</HI> and up went true Religi|on in much of the Power and Purity of it.

<P>This therefore is another Rea&s;on, why <HI>Je&s;us</HI> would have Mercy offered in the fir&s;t place to the bigge&s;t Sinners, becau&s;e that is the be&s;t way, if they receive it, mo&s;t to weaken the Kingdom of Satan and to keep it poor and low.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="003637_0025_10023A3F351A48B8">And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of the Hearts of &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious in your Town, in your Family, or Country, that this thing would be verified before your Faces?

<P>(<HI>Glorified God</HI>) How is that?

<P N="1">1. The Conte&s;ts that they u&s;ually have with the Devil at their parting with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Knowledge of his Secrets in his Workings.</P>
<P>For the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the bigge&s;t Sinners have u&s;ually great conte&s;t with the Devil at their parting; and this is an help to Satan: For ordinary Saints find afterwards what the vile ones find at fir&s;t; but when at the opening of Hearts, the one finds him&s;elf to be as the other the one is a Comfort to the other. The le&s;&s;er fort of Sinners find but little of this, till after they have been
<PB N="47" REF="003637_0026_10023A2CB6201058">
&s;ome time in profe&s;&s;ion; but the vile Man meets with his at the Beginning. Where|fore he, when the other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the &s;ame be|fore. For I &s;ay he has had it before. Satan is loath to part with a great Sinner: What my true Servant (quoth he) my old Servant wilt thou for&s;ake me now? Having &s;o often &s;old thy &s;elf to me to work Wickedne&s;s, wilt thou for&s;ake me now? Thou horrible Wretch doth not know, that thou ha&s;t &s;inned thy &s;elf beyond the reach of Grace, and do&s;t think to find Mercy now? Art not thou a Murderer, a Thief, a Harlot, a Witch, a Sinner of the greate&s;t &s;ize, and do&s;t thou look for Mercy now? Do&s;t thou think that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will foul his Fingers with thee?</P>
<P>'Tis enough to make Angels blu&s;h, <HI>&s;aith Satan,</HI> to &s;ee &s;o vile a one knock at Heavens Gates for Mercy, and wilt thou be &s;o abominably bold to do it? Thus Sa|tan dealt with me, &s;ays the great Sinner? when at fir&s;t I came to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

of the&s;e: And yet God was &s;o far off from rejecting of me (as I found afterwards) that there was mu&s;ick and dancing in his Hou&s;e for me, for Joy that I was come home unto him. <HI>Oh ble&s;&s;ed be God for grace,</HI> (&s;ays the other) <HI>for then I hope there is &s;avour for me.</HI> Yea, as I told you, &s;uch a one is a continual Spectacle in the Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or every one by to behold God's Grace, and Wonder!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> And as for the &s;ecrets of Satan, &s;uch as Sugge&s;tions to que&s;tion the Being of God, the Truth of his Word, and to be annoyed with devili&s;h Bla&s;phemies: None more acquainted with the&s;e than the bigge&s;t Sinners at their Conver&s;ion; where|fore thus al&s;o they are prepared to be helps in the Church, to relieve and comfort the other.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o here tell you of the Con|te&s;ts and Battles that &s;uch are engaged in, wherein they find the Buffetings of Satan, above any other of the Saints. At which time Satan A&s;&s;aults the Soul with Dark|ne&s;s&punc; Fears, frightful Thoughts of Appa|ritions; now they &s;weat, pant, cry out, and &s;truggle for Life.</P>
<P>The Angels now come down to behold the &s;ight, and rejoice to &s;ee a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of Du&s;t and A&s;hes to overcome Principalities and Powers, and Dominions. But as I &s;aid, when the&s;e come a little to be &s;ettled,

they are prepared for Help for others, and are great Comforts unto them. Their great Sins give encouragement to the Devil to a&s;&s;ault them, and by the&s;e Temp|tations <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> takes Advantage to make them the more helpful to the Churches.</P>
<P>The bigge&s;t Sinner, when he is Con|verted and come into the Church, &s;ays to them all, by his very coming in, <HI>Behold me, all you that are Men and Women of a low and timerous Spirit; you who&s;e hearts are narrow, for that you never had the advantage to know (becau&s;e your Sins are few) the largene&s;s of God.

<P>Wherefore as I have hinted before, when God intends to &s;tock a place with Saints, and to make that Place excellently to flouri&s;h with the Riches of his Grace, he u&s;ually begins with the Conver&s;ition of &s;ome of the mo&s;t notorious thereabouts, and lays them as an Example to allure others, and to build them up when they are converted.</P>

<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Another Rea&s;on, why <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> would have Mercy offered in the <HI>fir&s;t place</HI> to the bigge&s;t Sinners is, Becau&s;e they when converted&punc; are apt to love him mo&s;t.</P>

I would not di&s;|parage the Love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; I know the lea&s;t dram of it, when it reaches to <HI>For|givene&s;s</HI> is great above all the World; but comparatively, there is greater extentions of the Love of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to one, than to ano|ther: He that has mo&s;t Sin, if forgiven, is partaker of the greate&s;t Love, of the greate&s;t Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>I know al&s;o that there is &s;ome, that from this very Doctrine, &s;ay, <HI>Let us do Evil that Good may come,</HI> and that turn the Grace of our God into Laciviou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>After <HI>Martha</HI> had waited long, tried many ways to bring her Si&s;ter to good, and all proved ineffectual: At la&s;t, &s;he comes upon her thus; <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> quoth &s;he, <HI>I pray thee to go with me to the Temple to day, to hear one Preach a Sermon.</HI> What kind of Preacher is he, &s;aid &s;he? <HI>Martha</HI> repli|ed, <HI>It is one</HI> Je&s;us <HI>of</HI> Nazareth, <HI>He is the Hand&s;ome&s;t Man that ever you &s;aw with your Eyes; Oh! he &s;hines in Beauty, and is a mo&s;t excellent Preacher.</HI></P>

and all may be well: For this Pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ne&s;s is a very heinous thing in the Eyes of God: The Soul &s;aith he, that &s;hall do ought pre&s;umptuou&s;ly (whether born in the Land, or a Stranger) the &s;ame re|proacheth the Lord. <HI>And that Soul &s;hall be cut off from among his People,</HI> Numb. 15.20.</P>

<P>Now this Pre&s;umption, then puts it &s;elf in the place of Faith when it tampereth with the Promi&s;e of Life, while the Soul is a &s;tranger to Repentance: Wherefore you have in the Text, to prevent doing thus, both Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins to be offered to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> not Remi&s;&s;ion with|out Repentance; for all that repent not &s;hall peri&s;h, let them pre&s;ume on Grace, and the Promi&s;e while they will, <HI>Luke</HI> 13, 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Pre&s;umption then is that which &s;evereth <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> concluding that the Soul &s;hall be &s;aved by Grace, tho' the Man was never made &s;orry for his Sins, nor the love of the Heart turned there from This is to be &s;elf willed, as <HI>Peter</HI> has it, And this is a de&s;pi&s;ing the Word of the Lord, for that has put Repentance and Faith

<P>Therefore take good courage and believe. The de&s;ign of Satan is to tell the Pre&s;ump|tuous that their pre&s;uming on Mercy is good; but to per&s;wade the Believer, that his believing is impudent bold dealing with God.

all: I therefore am for gathering up the Stones, and for taking the &s;tumbling Blocks out of the way of God's People; and for|warning of them that they lay the &s;tumb|ling Block of their Iniquity before their Faces, and that are for pre&s;uming upon God's Mercy; and let them look to them|&s;elves, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>Al&s;o our Text &s;tands firm as ever it did, and our ob&s;ervation is &s;till of force, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> would have Mercy offered in the fir&s;t place to the bigge&s;t Sinners. So then let none Di&s;pair, let none Pre&s;ume: Let none Di&s;pair that are &s;orry for their Sins, and would be &s;aved by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let none re&s;ume that abide in the liking of their Sins; tho' they &s;eem to know the exceeding Grace of Chri&s;t; for tho' the Door &s;tand wide open for the reception of the Penitent, yet 'tis fa&s;t enough barred and bolted again&s;t the pre&s;umptuous Sinner. Be not deceived, God is not mocked; what|&s;oever a Man &s;ows, that he &s;hall reap. It cannot be that God &s;hould be wheadled out of his Mercy, or prevailed upon by Lips of Di&s;&s;imulation; He knows them that tru&s;t in him&punc; and that &s;incerely come to him by Chri&s;t for Mercy, <HI>Nahum</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P>It is then, not the abundance of Sin com|mitted, but the not coming heartily to God by Chri&s;t for Mercy, that &s;huts Men

out of Doors: And tho' their not coming heartily may be &s;aid to be but a Sin; yet 'tis &s;uch a Sin, as cau&s;eth that all the other Sins abide upon the unforgiven.</P>
<P>God complains of this, <HI>they have not cried unto me with their Heart; they turned, but not to the mo&s;t High. They turned feignedly,</HI> Jer 3, 10. Ho&s;. 7.14.16.</P>
<P>Thus doing, his Souls hates; but the penitent, humble, broken-hearted Sinner, be his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions red as Scarlet, red like Crim&s;on, in number as the &s;and, tho' his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions cry to Heaven again&s;t him for Vengeance, and &s;eem there to cry louder than do his Prayers, or Tears, or Groans, for Mercy; yet he is &s;afe. To this Man God will look, I&s;a. 1.18 <HI>ch.</HI> 66.2.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Would Je&s;us Chri&s;t have Mer|cy offered in the fir&s;t place to the bigge&s;t Sinners? Then here is ground for tho&s;e that as to practice have not been &s;uch, to come to him for Mercy.</P>
<P>Altho' there is no Sin little of it &s;elf, be|cau&s;e it is a Contradiction to the Nature and Maje&s;ty of God; yet we mu&s;t admit of divers Numbers, and al&s;o of Aggravati|ons, two Sins are not &s;o many as three; nor are three that are done in Ignorance &s;o big as one that is done again&s;t light, a|gain&s;t Knowlege, and Con&s;cience. Al&s;o there is the Child in Sin, and a Man in Sin; that has his Skin wrinkled for very

Age. And we mu&s;t put a Difference be|twixt the&s;e Sinners al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o: For can it be, that a Child of Seven, or ten, or &s;ixteen Years old, &s;hould be &s;uch a Sinner; a Sin|ner &s;o vile in Eye of the Law, as he is who has walked according to the cour&s;e of this World, forty, fifty, &s;ixty or &s;eventy Years? Now the Youth, this &s;tripling, tho' he is a Sinner, is but a little Sinner, when compared with &s;uch.</P>
<P>Now I &s;ay, if there be room for the fir&s;t &s;ort, for tho&s;e of the bigge&s;t &s;ize; If there be a Door wide enough for a Giant to go in at, there is certainly room for a Dwarf. If Chri&s;t Je&s;us has Grace enough to &s;ave great Sinners, he has &s;urely Grace enough to &s;ave little ones. If he can forgive, five hundred Pence, for certain he can forgive fifty, Luke 7.41, 42.</P>
<P>But you &s;aid before that the little Sinners mu&s;t &s;tand by, until the great ones have received their Grace, and that's di&s;coura|ging!</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, There are two &s;orts of little Sinners, &s;uch as are &s;o, and &s;uch as feign them&s;elves &s;o; they are tho&s;e that feign them&s;elves &s;o, that I intended there, and not tho&s;e that are indeed comparatively &s;o. Such as feign them&s;elves &s;o, may wait long enough before they obtain Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>But again, a Sinner may be comparative|ly a little Sinner, and &s;en&s;ibly a great one.
<PB N="111" REF="003637_0058_10023AB66C331810">
There is then two &s;orts of greatne&s;s in Sin; greatne&s;s by rea&s;on of Number, greatne&s;s by rea&s;on of throughne&s;s of Conviction of the horrible Nature of Sin. In this la&s;t Sen&s;e, he that has but one Sin, if &s;uch a one could be found, may in his own Eyes find him&s;elf the bigge&s;t Sinner in the World. Let this Man, or this Child therefore put him&s;elf among the great Sinners, and plead with God as great Sinners do, and expect to be &s;aved with the great Sinners; as &s;oon and as heartily as they.</P>
<P>Yea, a little Sinner, that comparatively is truly &s;o, if he &s;hall graciou&s;ly give way to Conviction, and &s;hall in God's light, dilligently weigh the horrible Nature of his own Sins may yet &s;ooner obtain For|givene&s;s for them at the hands of the hea|venly Father, than he that has ten times his Sins, and &s;o cau&s;e to cry ten times harder to God for his Mercy.</P>
<P>For the grievou&s;ne&s;s of the Cry is a great thing with God; for if he will hear the Widow if &s;he cries at all, how much if &s;he cries mo&s;t grievou&s;ly? <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.22, 23.</P>
<P>It is not the number, but the true &s;en&s;e of the abominable Nature of Sin, that makes the cry for Pardon Lamentable. He, as I &s;aid, that has many Sins may not cry &s;o loud in the Ears of God as he that has far fewer; he in our pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e, that is in his own Eyes the bigge&s;t Sinner, is he that &s;oone&s;t findeth Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0">The offer then is to the bigge&s;t Sinner to the bigge&s;t Sinner fir&s;t, and the Mercy is fir&s;t obtained, by him that fir&s;t confe&s;|&s;eth him&s;elf to be &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>There are Men that &s;trive at the Throne of Grace for Mercy by pleading the great|ne&s;s of their Nece&s;&s;ity. Now their Plea, as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in their counting up of the number, but in their &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of their Sins, and in the Vehemency of their Cry for Pardon. And it is ob&s;ervable, that tho' the Birth|right was <HI>Reubens,</HI> and for his Fooli&s;hne&s;s, given to the Sons of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>; yet <HI>Judah</HI> prevailed before his Brethren, and of him came the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 5.1, 3.</P>
<P>There is a heavenly Subtilty to be man|aged in this matter, <HI>Thy Brother came with Subtilty and hath taken thy Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> The Ble&s;&s;ing belonged to <HI>E&s;au,</HI> but <HI>Jacob</HI> by his Diligence made it his own, <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.35. The offer is to the bigge&s;t Sinner; to the bigge&s;t Sinner fir&s;t, but if he for|bears to cry, the Sinner that is a Sinner le&s;s by far than he, both as to the Number and the Nature of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, may get the Ble&s;&s;ing fir&s;t, if he &s;hould have Grace to be&s;tir him&s;elf well, for the loude&s;t cry is heard furthe&s;t; and the mo&s;t lamentable, pierces &s;oone&s;t.</P>
<P>I therefore urge this Head, not becau&s;e I would have little Sinners go and tell God
<PB N="113" REF="003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0">
that they are little Sinners, thereby to think to obtain his Mercy; for verily, &s;o they are never like to have it: For &s;uch words declare, that &s;uch a one hath no true &s;en&s;e at all of the nature of his Sins.</P>

<P>And I &s;ay, Let the love of Chri&s;t con|&s;train to this: Who de&s;erveth our Heart, our Mouth, our Life, our Goods &s;o much as Je&s;us Chri&s;t who has bought us to him|&s;elf by his Blood, to this very end, that we &s;hould be a peculiar People Zealous of good Works?</P>
<P>There is nothing more &s;eemly in the World, then to &s;ee a Chri&s;tian walk as be|comes the Go&s;pel; nor any thing more unbecoming a rea&s;onable Creature, than to hear a Man &s;ay, I believe in Chri&s;t, and yet &s;ee in his Life Debauchery and Profane|ne&s;s: Such Men &s;hould be counted the ba&s;|e&s;t of Men: Such Men &s;hould be counted

<P>It has oft-times come into my Mind to ask by what Means it is, that the Go&s;pel Profe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;o haunted with loo&s;e and carnal Go&s;pelers? And I could never arrive to better Satisfaction in the matter than this: Such Men are made Profe&s;&s;ors by the Devil, and &s;o by him put among the re&s;t of the Godly. A certain Man had a fruitle&s;s Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard; but by whom was it planted there? Even him that &s;owed the Tares, his own Children among the Wheat, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.6. <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.37, <HI>to</HI> 40. And that was the Devil. But why doth the Devil do thus: Not of love to them, but to make of them Offences and &s;tumbling-blocks to others. For he knows that a loo&s;e profe&s;&s;or in the Church, does more mi&s;chief to Religion than ten can do to it that are in the World.</P>
<P>Was it not, think you, the Devil that &s;tirred up the Dam&s;el that you read of in <HI>Acts</HI> 16. to cry out, <HI>The&s;e are the Servants of the mo&s;t high God that &s;hew unto us the way of Salvation</HI>; Yes, it was as is evident,

for <HI>Paul</HI> was grieved to hear it. But why did the Devil &s;tir up her to cry &s;o? But becau&s;e that was the way to blemi&s;h the Go&s;pel, to make the World think that it came from the &s;ame hand as did her Sooth-&s;aying and Witchery, v. 16, 17, 18. <HI>Holi|ne&s;s O Lord, becomes thy Hou&s;e for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Let therefore, whoever they be that pro|fe&s;s the Name of Chri&s;t, take heed that that &s;candal not profe&s;&s;ion which they make of him, &s;ince he has &s;o graciou&s;ly offered us, as we are Sinners of the bigge&s;t &s;ize, in the fir&s;t place his Grace to &s;ave us.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;poken of the Riches of the Grace of Chri&s;t, and of the the Free|ne&s;s of his Heart to embrace the <HI>Jeru&s;alem-&s;inners,</HI> it may not be ami&s;s to give you yet as a Caution, an Intimation of one thing, namely, <HI>That this Grace and Freene&s;s of the Heart is limited to Time and Day, the which who&s;o</HI> over&s;tandeth, <HI>&s;hall Peri&s;h notwith&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>For, as a King who of Grace, &s;endeth out to his rebellious People, an Offer of Pardon, if they accept thereof by &s;uch a Day, yet be|headeth or hangeth, tho&s;e that come not in for Mercy until the Day or Time be pa&s;t. So Chri&s;t Je&s;us has &s;et the Sinner a Day of Salvation, and acceptable times; but he who &s;tandeth out, or goeth on in Rebelli|on beyond that time, is like to come off with the lo&s;s of his Soul. 2 Cor. 6.2.

3.13, 16 <HI>to</HI> 19. <HI>Chap.</HI> 4 7. Luk. 19.31.42.</P>
<P>Since therefore things are thus, it may. be convenient here to touch a little upon the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That this day or time thus limited when it is con&s;idered with Reference to this or that Man, is oft-times undi&s;cerned by the Per&s;on concerned therein; and always is kept &s;ecret as to the &s;hutting up thereof.</P>
<P>And this in the Wi&s;dom of God is thus to the end, no Man when called upon, &s;hould put off turning to God to another time: Now and to Day, is that, and only that which is revealed in Holy Writ, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.22. <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.13, 16.</P>
<P>And this &s;hews us the de&s;perate hazards which tho&s;e Men run, who when Invitati|on or Conviction attends them, put off turn|ing to God to be &s;aved till another, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they think a more fit Sea&s;on and time; for many by &s;o doing defer this to Day, till the Day of God's Patience and long &s;uffer|ing is ended: and then, for their Prayers and Crys after Mercy, they receive nothing but Mocks, and are laughed at by the God of Heaven, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.20 <HI>to</HI> 29. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.65.12 <HI>to</HI> 17. <HI>Chap.</HI> 66.4. <HI>Zech.</HI> 7.11, 12.13.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another thing to be con&s;ider|ed is this, namely, that the Day of God's Grace with &s;ome Men begins &s;ooner, and al&s;o &s;ooner ends, than it doth with others. Tho&s;e at the fir&s;t Hour of the Day, had

their Call &s;ooner than they who were call|ed upon to turn to God, at the <HI>Sixth</HI> Hour of the Day; yea, and they who were hired at the <HI>Third</HI> Hour, had their Call &s;ooner than they who were called at the <HI>Eleventh, Matth.</HI> 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Day of God's Patience began with <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> and al&s;o ended before he was twenty Years old. At thirteen Years of Age he was Circumci&s;ed; and the next Year after <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was born, and then <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> was fourteen Years old: Now that Day that <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was weaned, that Day was <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> rejected; and &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>I&s;aac</HI> was three Years old before he was weaned; that Day was but the &s;eventeenth Year of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> wherefore then the Day of God's Grace was ended with him betimes, <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.24.25. <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.2. <HI>to</HI> 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.30.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cain's</HI> Days ended with him betimes, for after God had rejected him, he lived to beget many Children, and built a City, and to do many other things.</P>
<P>But alas, all that while he was a Fugative and a Vagabond. Nor carried he any thing with him after the Day of his Rejection was come, but this doleful Language in his Con&s;cience, <HI>from God's Face &s;hall I be hid.</HI> Gen. 4.10 <HI>to</HI> 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>E&s;au</HI> thro' his Extravigancies, would needs go &s;ell his Birth right, not fearing (as other confident Fools) but that yet

<P>Let the&s;e things therefore be a further Caution to tho&s;e that fit under the glorious Sound of the Go&s;pel, and hear of the Rich|es of the Grace of God in Chri&s;t to poor Sinners.</P>
<P>To &s;light Grace, to de&s;pi&s;e Mercy, and to &s;top the Ear when God &s;peaks, when he &s;peaks &s;uch great th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gs &s;o much to our Profit, is a great Provocation.</P>
<P>He offereth, he calls, he wooes, he in|vites, he prays, he be&s;eeches us, in this Day of his Grace to be reconciled to him; yea, and has provided for us the Means of Re|conciliation him&s;elf: Now this de&s;pi&s;ed mu&s;t needs be provoking, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</P>

<P>All this while God has not left the Sin|ners, nor is come to the end of his Patience towards him, but &s;tands at lea&s;t with the Door of Grace a jar in his Hand, as being loth as yet to bolt it again&s;t him.</P>
