<P>The Character of Doctor <HI>PRIESTLEY,</HI> is known to &s;tand very high in the literary World. This &s;mall Tract is as much celebrated as any of his numerous Publications. It is &s;aid, that above thirty Thou&s;and Copies of it have been &s;old in En|gland. This affords a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, in fa|vour of that weight of Evidence which it contains.

<P>It would be offering an in&s;ult to your profe&s;&s;ion, to your cha|racters, to your high preten&s;ions to literature, to &s;uppo&s;e that you can be offended with the following publication. As gentlemen you mu&s;t be candid. As Chri&s;tians, you mu&s;t be forbearing. As men of &s;cience, you mu&s;t wi&s;h to give every &s;ub|ject a fair hearing.</P>
<P>We are no longer confined, within tho&s;e &s;oporiferous circles, which were drawn by vindictive bigots, in the darke&s;t ages. We are now &s;en&s;ible, that it is our duty to know the truth, that the truth will make us free. We are convinced, al&s;o, that an implicit faith is not the duty of a Chri&s;tian, but, on the contrary, that we &s;hould prove all things, and hold fa&s;t that which is good, or that every man &s;hould be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind.</P>
<P>If therefore, the &s;entiments which are urged upon us, in the tract before you be founded in truth, you, will give them all their influence upon your&s;elves, and will recommend them, with the ut|mo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, to all your different audiences.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, you have rea&s;on to apprehend, that any errors are propagated in this book, you have a fair opportunity of confuting them. But read, read candidly and impartially, before you pronounce the &s;entence of condemnation, and direct all tho&s;e with whom you have any connection, to give the mo&s;t unbounded &s;cope to their examination of the doctrines in que&s;tion, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ay, that you are afraid of the light or injuriou&s;ly charge you, with being either not able to defend the truth, or willing to conceal it under an impenetrable chaos.</P>
<P>When you &s;eriou&s;ly Weigh the preceding reflections, I &s;hall, I am &s;ure, receive your thanks for the pre&s;ent publication, and you will endeavour to accelerate the circulation of it over all this va&s;t continent.</P>
<P>Suffer me to throw out another ob&s;ervation in vindication of my&s;elf, &s;ome copies of this pamphlet have crept in among us, and are &s;ecretly making many pro&s;elites. on the &s;uppo&s;ition, then, that it is an heretical performance, by thus making it better known, you the phy&s;icians are called in, before it be too late, to extricate the poi&s;on, and to prevent the &s;preading of the contagi|on, before it go beyond the reach of a radical remedy.</P>

<P>I WISH you to be without &s;pot. But, I am afraid, if you examine your own conduct, that you cannot &s;ay, this is altogether the ca&s;e, you have no occa&s;ion to be directed not to imitate tho&s;e who &s;tile them&s;elves the orthodox, in their malicious calumny, in their aptitude to do every injury in their power to tho&s;e who differ from them, or in their habit of condemning unheard, or rejecting without reading them, &s;uch authors as contradict their own &s;entiments. But after you have fully examined the doctrines of any particular church, and are decidedly clear in your own minds, that &s;uch doctrines are diametrically repugnant to the good word of truth, I wi&s;h you to imitate the <HI>orthodox</HI> in not appearing to give any countenance to &s;uch doctrines.</P>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible, according to the expre&s;s declaration of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that THE ONLY TRUE GOD IS THE FATHER of all; and you believe with the apo&s;tle Paul, and with all the other in&s;pired writers of the Old and New-Te&s;tament, that THERE IS BUT ONE GOD EVEN THE FATHER, who was never born, who could not become a child, nor &s;uffer death nor be &s;ubject to any po&s;&s;ible change.</P>
<P>Should you not, therefore, make your light to &s;hine? If only two or three of you were convinced of this great truth, &s;hould you not by publickly prote&s;ting again&s;t the wor&s;hip of more Gods than one, declare your &s;upreme veneration of the one only God?</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that the <HI>true wor&s;hippers wor&s;hip</HI> THE FATHER ONLY, and that the true wor&s;hippers wor&s;hip him <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> But, they cannot be deemed true wor&s;hippers who do not wor&s;hip at all, who put their candle under a bu&s;hel, who hide their talent in the earth, and do not wor&s;hip in the face of men, or, who through the &s;lavi&s;h fear of appearing &s;ingular, give countenance to the wor&s;hip of three, or four Gods.</P>
<P>Come out from among them, and be ye &s;eparate. Be not a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t, and his kingdom. Shew your faith by your works. Wor&s;hip publickly the one Eternal Jehovah. This is your duty, which you cannot controvert or deny. Let it not therefore be &s;aid of you on the la&s;t day, that your fear of your fellow creatures was &s;uperior to your veneration of the Almighty Creator, that you loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e your deeds were evil.</P>
<P>The great Lord of the univer&s;e requireth &s;incerity from us. But we cannot be &s;incere when we appear to give his glory to another.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are my brethren in nature, and equally with me, &s;ubjects of the one univer&s;al parent.</P>
<P>Some of you are charged with duplicity. Some of you are charged with bigotry. Some of you are charged with in&s;incerity, in being &s;aid to appear to conform to what you utterly di&s;approve. The&s;e are heavy charges. Wipe them away, by examining can|didly every thing that has any preten&s;ions to truth, and by adher|ing firmly to whatever your unprejudiced rea&s;on &s;hall convince you is truth.</P>
<P>I believe, you have generally rejected Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e it's doctrines have been perver&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented to you. You have been told that the doctrine of a trinity is it's grand ba&s;is, and that the doctrines of original Sin, prede&s;tination, a &s;atisfaction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the &s;uper&s;tructures. But examine chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, and you will find that it contains none of the&s;e doctrines. It is a pure Sy&s;tem of faith, in the one God, and Father of all: and of peace and good will to men.</P>
<P>It's real doctrines you have now before you, can you &s;ay, that any of the&s;e are unworthy of the divine perfections? Can you &s;ay that any of the&s;e are repugnant to the natural dictates of your own minds? Can you &s;ay, that God could not reveal him&s;elf to men? Can you &s;ay, that the infinitely benevolent Being who&s;e tender mercies are ever over all his works, is not as much di&s;|po&s;ed to enlighten our minds and to re&s;cue us from the &s;nares of Sin and death, as to pre&s;erve our bodies and pour upon us a pro|fu&s;ion of earthly joys? Look to your&s;elves we mu&s;t all hereafter be accountable for the talents we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>This pre&s;ent world is wearing away, The younge&s;t of us mu&s;t &s;oon leave it. If, then, there be another world, this &s;hould be our grand concern. What can I &s;ay more? The great God has not implanted in us wi&s;hes for immortality, without intending us for &s;uch a &s;tate. But if we ca&s;t away his in&s;tructions, and treat them with &s;corn, without any examination of them, what can our ex|pectations be?</P>
<P>The author of all our benefits, is entitled to our uncea&s;ing prai&s;|es. Every thing worthy of him, &s;hould be the &s;ubject of our mo&s;t delightful meditations, and we &s;hould always e&s;teem his fa|vour as better than life.</P>

<HEAD>An Appeal to the &s;erious and candid Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Chri&s;tian Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT one who profe&s;&s;es obedience to the &s;ame Lord, and faith in the precious promi&s;es of the &s;ame go&s;pel with your&s;elves to addre&s;s him&s;elf to you, with all freedom and plainne&s;s of &s;peech, on &s;ubjects relating to our common &s;alvation. I need not tell you that the&s;e &s;ubjects are intere&s;ting. In reality, nothing el&s;e is intere&s;ting in compari&s;on with them. For what is this world compared with the future! What is time compared with eternity! Believe me my brethren, it is nothing but the deepe&s;t concern for the honour of a religion which is the mo&s;t valuable inheritance of the human race, and which &s;ets us above all the follies and vices, all the weakne&s;&s;es and troubles of life, by giving us the mo&s;t &s;olid hope in death, that, has induced me to &s;olicit your attention. But I am confident that you will not think it ill be&s;towed, becau&s;e it is upon a &s;ubject that is near and dear to you, and the con&s;ideration of which cannot, but plea&s;e and profit you.</P>
<P>If, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our common endeavours to <HI>lead,</HI> and to be <HI>led into all truth,</HI> I &s;hall be &s;o happy as to bring you to en|tertain the &s;ame views of the&s;e things with my&s;elf, we &s;hall rejoice together; and if, after all that I may be able to advance, you &s;hould &s;till think differently from me, I tru&s;t you will, at lea&s;t, be di&s;po&s;ed to think with more candour of &s;ome of your fellow-chri&s;tians, who love the go&s;pel, and are zealous for its honour, though you may think them mi&s;taken in their conceptions concerning it. Let me intreat you, therefore, my brethren, to give me a patient and can|did hearing. Attend, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, to what I &s;hall &s;ay from the earne&s;tne&s;s of my heart; and exerci&s;e the rea&s;on which God has given you upon this occa&s;ion, which is the noble&s;t on which it can be exerci&s;ed, and for which you may, therefore, conclude, that it was principally given you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of the U&s;e of Rea&s;on in Matters of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>BE not backward, or afraid, my brethren, to make u&s;e of your rea&s;on in matters of religion, or where the &s;criptures are concerned. They both of them proceed from the &s;ame God and Father of us all, who is the giver of every good and every perfect gift. They cannot, therefore, be contrary to one another, but mu&s;t mutually illu&s;trate and enforce one another. Be&s;ides, how can we di&s;tingui&s;h one &s;cheme of religion from another, &s;o as to give the preference to that which is the mo&s;t de&s;erving of it, but by the help of our rea&s;on and under&s;tanding? What would you your&s;elves &s;ay to a Mahometan, whom you would per&s;uade to
<PB N="8" REF="018741_0007_0FA81B763B4D6198">
abandon the impo&s;ture of Mahomet, and embrace chri&s;tianity, but bid him u&s;e his rea&s;on; and judge, by the help of it, of the ma|nife&s;t difference between the two religions, and the great &s;uperiority of yours to his? Does not God him&s;elf appeal to the rea&s;on of man, when he conde&s;cends to a&s;k us, <HI>Whether his ways be not equal?</HI> Ezek. xviii. 29. Does not the apo&s;tle exhort us that <HI>in under&s;tanding we be men?</HI> 1 Cor. xiv. 20. Are we not expre&s;&s;ly commanded to <HI>prove all things, and then hold fa&s;t that which is good?</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. v. 21. Al&s;o, when we are commanded to <HI>&s;earch the &s;criptures,</HI> John v. 39 more mu&s;t be meant than merely <HI>reading</HI> them, or <HI>receiving implicitly,</HI> the interpretations of others. <HI>Searching</HI> mu&s;t imply an earne&s;t endeavour to find out for our&s;elves, and to under&s;tand the truths contained in the &s;criptures; and what faculty can we employ for this purpo&s;e, but that which is commonly called <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> whereby we are capable of thinking, reflecting, comparing, and judging of things?</P>
<P>Di&s;tru&s;t, therefore, all tho&s;e who decry human rea&s;on, and who require you to abandon it, wherever religion is concerned. When once they have gained this point with you, they can lead you whither they plea&s;e, and impo&s;e upon you every ab&s;urdity which their &s;ini&s;ter views may make it expedient for them that you &s;hould embrace. A Popi&s;h Prie&s;t would require nothing more than this, to make you believe the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and that a man is infallible; or to per&s;uade you to commit the mo&s;t flagrant wickedne&s;s; as a means of <HI>doing God &s;ervice.</HI> For the fir&s;t of the&s;e articles they do not fail to urge the words of &s;cripture, which ex|pre&s;sly &s;ay, concerning the bread that is u&s;ed in the Lord's &s;upper, that it <HI>is the body of Chri&s;t;</HI> Matt. xxvi. 6. and there is no po&s;&s;ibility of replying to them, but by appealing to rea&s;on, as the nece&s;&s;ary and proper judge of the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture. The Papi&s;ts, therefore, as might well be expected, is forward, on all occa&s;ions, to vilify human rea&s;on, and to require men to abandon it; but true Pro|te&s;tants will not part with it. It is by the help of rea&s;on, in con|junction with the &s;criptures, that we guard our&s;elves again&s;t the gro&s;s delu&s;ions of the Papi&s;ts, who, after relinqui&s;hing rea&s;on, have been <HI>made to believe a lie;</HI> and by the diligent and continued u&s;e of the &s;ame power, let us endeavour to combat every remaining error, and trace out and reform every corruption of chri&s;tianity, till we hold the pure <HI>truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> and <HI>obey it in the love thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Do not think that, by recommending the u&s;e of rea&s;on, I am about to decry the &s;criptures. My appeal &s;hall be to both, upon every &s;ubject on which I addre&s;s you; and I think you cannot but &s;ee that the plainne&s;t and mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e of the &s;criptures is in favour of tho&s;e doctrines which are mo&s;t agreeable to rea&s;on. A good man will rejoice to &s;ee them thus go hand in hand, mutually illu&s;trating and enforcing one another.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Of the Power of Man to do the Will of God.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the &s;ubjects with re&s;pect to which I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that you would attend to the voice of rea&s;on and the &s;criptures, and with re&s;pect to which, one mi&s;take will be followed by many others, and mi&s;takes of great con&s;equence, is concerning <HI>the power of man to do the will of God.</HI> It is a favourite opinion with many teachers of religion, that men have <HI>naturally</HI> (or by that con&s;titu|tion and frame which God their maker hath given them) no power at all to do any thing that is good, not even to think a good thought, much le&s;s actually to obey any of the commands of God; &s;o that, if men were left to them&s;elves, they could do nothing but &s;in, and mu&s;t be under a nece&s;&s;ity of aggravating their con|demnation, by every thought, word, and action of their lives. But, my brethren, how does this doctrine agree with the &s;crip|tures, and particularly with the manner in which the Divine Being con&s;tantly expo&s;tulates with the &s;inful &s;ons of men; as when he &s;ays to the Jews,
<Q>Turn ye turn ye from your evil ways, why will ye die, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 11. Wa&s;h ye make you clean.</Q>
Cea&s;e to do evil learn to do well, &amp;c, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 16.</P>
<P>Is it not plain from this, that it depends upon men them&s;elves, whether they will repent and turn to God or not? And how can it depend upon them&s;elves if they have not naturally, a &s;ufficient power to do it? You cannot think that God would command, and expect obedience, when he had not given power to obey; and much le&s;s that he would urge men to provide for their own &s;afety and happine&s;s, when him&s;elf had put an effectual bar in the way of it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that any man's children were &s;hut up in a building that was on fire, while he him&s;elf was without, and had the key: and that, in&s;tead of opening the door, to favour their e&s;cape, he &s;hould only call out to them to flee out of the place, in order to avoid in&s;tant de&s;truction; and that, as the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of this, they &s;hould all peri&s;h in the flames before his eyes; what would you think of &s;uch a father? You would want words to expre&s;s your abhorrence of his cruelty; and yet in this very light do many chri&s;tian divines repre&s;ent the conduct of that God <HI>who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works,</HI> and who has &s;olemnly declared, <HI>that he hath no plea&s;ure in the death of a &s;inner, but rather that he would turn from his way and live</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. yea, <HI>who would have all men to be &s;aved.</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 4.</P>
<P>The conduct of our <HI>merciful God and Father,</HI> is certainly far different from this, and more agreeable to rea&s;on and equity. If he de&s;igned us to be accountable creatures, and treats us as &s;uch we mu&s;t have <HI>talents</HI> given us, which we may either improve or mi&s;improve. If we be the &s;ubjects of his <HI>moral government,</HI> we mu&s;t be in a condition either to <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> or to <HI>break</HI> his laws. A power to do the one nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es a power to do the other; and without this power we &s;hould not be the proper &s;ubjects
<PB N="10" REF="018741_0009_0FA81B779B49BBA8">
of religion; as, in that ca&s;e it would be vain to propo&s;e to us either rewards for obedience, or puni&s;hments for di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;uppo&s;ition of a power in man to do the will of God, any foundation for <HI>pride.</HI> For we mu&s;t &s;till &s;ay, with the apo&s;tle, <HI>What have we that we have not received? and how then can we glory, as if we had not received it? Every good and every per|fect gift comes from God;</HI> and, knowing this, the more we receive of his bounty, the more thankful, and the more humble we &s;hould be. I &s;hall, certainly, be more &s;olicitous to exert my&s;elf in doing the will of God, when, I believe that I have a talent to improve, than if I believe that I have no talent intru&s;ted with me at all; &s;o that I cannot do even &s;o much as the <HI>wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, who hid his talent in a napkin.</HI></P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e per&s;ons who believe that all mankind are ab&s;olute|ly incapable of doing any good, are &s;ometimes heard to invite &s;in|ners of all kinds to come to Chri&s;t, <HI>as they are,</HI> and to &s;ay, that the viler they are, the more welcome they will be to him; as if he was, after this, to clean&s;e them by &s;ome miraculous power. But, my brethren, the invitation of the go&s;pel runs in very different terms. It is, <HI>Repent, and bring forth fruits meet for re|pentance.</HI> Matt. iii. 8. <HI>Repent, and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> Acts iii. 19 And none are invited <HI>to come to Chri&s;t,</HI> but tho&s;e who <HI>labour and are heavy laden;</HI> nor can they <HI>find re&s;t for their &s;ouls,</HI> till they have <HI>actually learned of him to be meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Matt. xi. 28.</P>
<P>What can be more contrary to the maxims above-mentioned, than the whole tenor of that &s;erious expo&s;tulation with the children of I&s;rael in the prophet I&s;aiah, part of which I quoted above? <HI>wa&s;h you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, judge the fatherle&s;s, plead for the widow. Come now,</HI> (and not before) <HI>and let us rea&s;on together, &s;ays the Lord. Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool.</HI> I&s;a. i. 16, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others, who entertain the &s;ame opinion of the utter inability of man to do the will of God, act more con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e &s;en|timents, but far more incon&s;i&s;tently with the &s;criptures, in never preaching to &s;inners at all; though to <HI>call &s;inners to repentance</HI> was the chief end of Chri&s;t's coming into the world. <HI>Matt.</HI> ix. 13.</P>
<P>Whatever repre&s;ents a &s;tate of acceptance with God, as a thing that may be brought about without any efforts of our own, and e&s;pecially if it may be done in a moment, or in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, is &s;ure to be a popular doctrine. Mankind in general care not how little is expected of them, or how little they them&s;elves have to do, in order to get to heaven. But true religion, that alone which affords &s;olid ground of hope towards God, con&s;i&s;ts in a change of heart, affections, and habits; which can only be brought about by &s;erious re&s;olution, and a vigorous and con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ant exertion of our powers.

<P>To believe, as the &s;ame per&s;ons do, that faith and repentance are nothing that we our&s;elves are capable of, but altogether the mira|culous operation of the &s;pirit of God in us and upon us, &s;uppo&s;es that this great and &s;udden change may as well take place at the <HI>la&s;t</HI> hour of life, as at any other; which certainly encourages the mo&s;t unwarrantable and mo&s;t dangerous pre&s;umption, and is far from having any countenance in the &s;criptures.

<P>AS a foundation for this &s;trange doctrine, of the utter inability of men to do what God requires of them, a doctrine &s;o in|jurious both to our Maker and our&s;elves, it is &s;aid that by his fir&s;t offence our fir&s;t parent Adam, and all his po&s;terity, lo&s;t all power of doing any thing acceptable to God for the future; that he was the repre&s;entative of all his po&s;terity; &s;o that when he &s;inned, we all &s;inned; and, every &s;in being an offence again&s;t an infinite God, we all became, from that moment, liable to an infinite puni&s;hment, even the everla&s;ting wrath and cur&s;e of our Maker. And they &s;ay, that, on this account only, it would have been ju&s;t in God to have made us all &s;uffer the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and endle&s;s torments in hell, even though we had never &s;inned in our own per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But, my brethren, you find nothing like any part of this in your bibles. For there you read, <HI>The &s;oul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die.</HI> Ezek. xviii. 4. And long after the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Adam, and to this very day, God is continually calling upon men to <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well;</HI> which certainly &s;uppo&s;es that men always have had, and that we now have, a power to do &s;o. It is allowed that we <HI>&s;uffer</HI> by the &s;in of Adam, as any child may &s;uffer in con&s;equence of the wickedne&s;s of his ance&s;tor; but it is not po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have <HI>&s;inned</HI> in him. Wherever there is <HI>&s;in,</HI> there is <HI>guilt,</HI> that is, &s;omething that may be the foundation of <HI>re|mor&s;e</HI> of con&s;cience; &s;omething that a man may be <HI>&s;orry for,</HI> and <HI>re|pent of;</HI> &s;omething that he may wi&s;h he had not done; all which clearly implies, that &s;in is &s;omething that a man has given his <HI>con|&s;ent</HI> to, and therefore mu&s;t be convinced of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of his being puni&s;hed for But how can any man repent of the &s;in of Adam, or feel any thing like remor&s;e of con&s;cience for it; when he cannot but know that he never gave his con&s;ent to it, and could not po&s;&s;ibly have been, in the lea&s;t degree, acce&s;&s;ary to it? Good and bad conduct are, in their own nature, per&s;onal, and cannot po&s;|&s;ibly

We may receive harm by means of one per&s;on, and benefit by means of another, but no &s;in of the former, or righteou&s;ne&s;s of the latter, can be con&s;idered as ours, in the eye of an equitable and ju&s;t God.

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> Of Election and Reprobation.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSING that all mankind became liable to the ever|la&s;ting wrath and cur&s;e of God for the &s;in of one man, &s;ome divines &s;ay, that it was mercy in God to &s;ave any, though by an <HI>arbitrary decree,</HI> which left all the re&s;t of the human race under an inevitable nece&s;&s;ity of peri&s;hing. But certainly, my brethren, &s;uch <HI>tender mercy is cruelty.</HI> All the creatures of God mu&s;t look up to him as the author of their being, &s;ince it was, undoubtedly, in his power to give, or to withhold it, at his plea&s;ure; and, &s;urely, a good and merciful God would have put a &s;top to the propagation of &s;uch a race of creatures, rather then &s;uffer them to be born in &s;uch &s;hocking circum&s;tances; in which he infallibly fore&s;aw, that the greate&s;t part of them mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to, and even actually &s;uffer remedile&s;s de&s;truction. As &s;urely as I derive my being from a ju&s;t and merciful God, I conclude that the terms on which I came into the world are advantageous to me; and therefore, that it mu&s;t be my own fault only, if I have not rea&s;on to rejoice in it, and to be thankful, for it. But, indeed, I can hardly think that any man &s;eriou&s;ly believes, that the greate&s;t part of his fellow-creatures are born into the world under a predetermined nece&s;&s;ity of being for ever mi&s;erable. For in that ca&s;e, it mu&s;t appear probable that any children which he him&s;elf may be the means of bringing into the world will be for ever mi&s;erable; and &s;urely no man of real goodne&s;s or compa&s;&s;ion would wi&s;h to have children, or be nece&s;&s;ary to their being born in &s;uch circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>If this doctrine be true, what motive can any man have to en|deavour to <HI>flee from the wrath to come.</HI> Matt. iii. 7. when if it is to be his lot at all, nothing that he can do will enable him to e&s;cape it; or what motive can a man have to exert him&s;elf to <HI>lay hold on eternal life,</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 12. when, if he is to enjoy it at all, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;s of it, or of any thing belonging to it, or that is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare him for it? What rea&s;on had the apo&s;tle Paul to exhort Chri&s;tians to <HI>take heed le&s;t they &s;hould fall,</HI> 1 Cor. x. 12. when none that ever did &s;tand could po&s;&s;ibly fall? and what rea&s;on had he to <HI>labour, left after having preached to others, he him&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 27. when, being certain of his conver&s;ion, he mu&s;t have known that that con&s;equence was impo&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>This doctrine, of ab&s;olute election and reprobation, is certainly

a doctrine of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and not a <HI>doctrine according to godline&s;s;</HI> and let divines employ all the ingenuity they are ma&s;ters of, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to clear this opinion from being the cau&s;e of fatal de&s;pair in &s;ome, and as fatal a &s;ecurity in others. If this opinion were true, and men were really aware of their &s;ituation, I &s;hould think it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent their falling into ab&s;olute di&s;traction, through terror and anxiety.

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Of the Divinity of Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>SO fatal have the con&s;equences of the &s;in of Adam been repre|&s;ented, that you have been told, that nothing but the blood of God him&s;elf could rever&s;e them; and therefore you have been taught to believe, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who&s;e proper title is <HI>the &s;on of man,</HI> as well as <HI>the &s;on of God,</HI> was not merely <HI>man,</HI> but very and eternal <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf; without con&s;idering that, by thus ma|king more Gods than one, you are guilty of a breach of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important of all the commandments, which &s;ays expre&s;s|ly, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me,</HI> Exod. xx. 3. But whatever &s;uch divines may &s;ay, the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, in direct contradiction to them, that,
<Q>To us there is but one God, the FATHER, of whom are all things; and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom are all things, and we by him, 1 Cor. viii. 6.</Q>
And again, after &s;aying that we have <HI>one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m,</HI> he adds,
<Q>one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, Eph. iv. 5.6.</Q>
The creed of all Chri&s;tians, therefore, ought to be,
<Q>There is ONE GOD, and one mediator between God and men, the MAN Chri&s;t Je&s;us, 1 Tim. ii. 5.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Father</HI> is frequently &s;tiled <HI>God,</HI> even with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, as well as other beings.
<Q>The God of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of glory, give unto you, that ye may know the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power, which he wrought in Chri&s;t, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead, and &s;et him at his own right hand, &amp;c. Eph. i. 17. &amp;c.</Q>
Chri&s;t him&s;elf u&s;es the &s;ame language.
<Q>I a&s;cend unto my Father, and your Father, and unto my God, and your God, John xx. 17. My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</Q></P>

<Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, the Son can do nothing of him&s;elf, John v. 19. I can of mine own &s;elf do nothing. As I hear I judge, and my judgement is ju&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;eek not mine own will, but the will of the Father, who &s;ent me, v. 30.

Matt. xxviii. 18 <HI>He even calls his Fa|ther</HI> the only true God, John xvii. 3 that they might know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</Q>
It appears to me not to be in the power of language to exclude the idea of the divinity of Chri&s;t more expre&s;sly than by the&s;e &s;olemn words.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the divine communications with which our Lord was favoured, &s;ome things are expre&s;sly &s;aid to be withheld from him. For he him&s;elf, &s;peaking of his &s;econd coming, &s;ays, Mark xiii. 32. <HI>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Fa|ther.</HI> In Matthew xxiv. 36. where the &s;ame ob&s;ervation is re|peated, it is, <HI>but my Father only.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tles notwith&s;tanding their attachment to their Lord, and Ma&s;ter, always pre&s;erve the idea of his &s;ubordination to the Father, and con&s;ider all his honour and power as derived from him.
<Q>He received from God the Father, honour and glory, 2 Pet. i. 17. It plea&s;ed the Father, that in him &s;hould all fullne&s;s dwell, Col i. 19. The revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which God gave unto him, Rev. i. 1. Ye are Chri&s;t's and Chri&s;t is God's, 1 Cor. iii. 23. The head of Chri&s;t is God, 1 Cor. xi. 3</Q></P>
<P>The rea&s;on why Chri&s;t was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed by God the Father, is frequently and fully expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;criptures, viz. his obedience to the will of God, and e&s;pecially in his &s;ubmitting to die for the benefit of mankind.
<Q>Therefore doth my Father love me, becau&s;e I lay down my life, John x. 17. He humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s. Wherefore God has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven and things in earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord to the Glory of God the Father, Phil. ii. 8&mdash;11. Who, for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is now &s;at down at the right hand of God. Heb. xii. 2.</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord &s;ays, that <HI>he and his Father are one.</HI> John x. 30. but he &s;ufficiently explains him&s;elf, when he prays that all his di&s;ciples may be
<Q>one with him, and his Father, even as they are one. John xvii. ii. and he gives them the &s;ame glory
<PB N="15" REF="018741_0014_0FA81B7B82B38358">
which God had given to him, ver. 22.</Q>
Be&s;ides, at the very time that our Lord &s;ays, that he and his father are one, and in the very &s;entence preceding it, ver. 29. he &s;ays, that "his Father is "greater than all. But how could the Father be greater than all, if there was any other, who was &s;o much <HI>one</HI> with him, as to be, in all, re&s;pects <HI>equal</HI> to him.</P>
<P>The mere term <HI>God</HI> is, indeed. &s;ometimes u&s;ed in a lower and inferior &s;en&s;e in the &s;criptures, denoting <HI>dominion</HI> only; as when the Divine Being him&s;elf &s;ays, that <HI>he will make Mo&s;es a god to Pharaoh,</HI> Exod. vii. 1; but &s;urely, there can be no danger of our mi&s;taking the &s;en&s;e of &s;uch phra&s;es as the&s;e; or if it were po&s;&s;ible, our Lord him&s;elf has &s;ufficiently guarded again&s;t any mi&s;con|&s;truction of them when applied to him&s;elf, by the explanation he has given of them; informing us, that if in the language of &s;cripture, <HI>they are called gods to whom the word of God came,</HI> John x. 35 (though, in fact, they were no other than mere men) he could not be guilty of bla&s;phemy in calling him&s;elf only the <HI>Son of God.</HI> Now if Chri&s;t had been con&s;cious to him&s;elf that he was the <HI>true and very God,</HI> and that it was of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence to mankind that they &s;hould regard him in that light, this was certainly a proper time for him to have declared him&s;elf, and not to have put his hearers off with &s;uch an apology as this.</P>
<P>But even this power and dominion, to which Chri&s;t is advanced by God his Father, <HI>who gave all power into his hands,</HI> and who <HI>made him head over all things to his church,</HI> Eph. i. 22, this <HI>media|torial kingdom</HI> of Chri&s;t (as it is &s;ometimes, and with &s;ufficient propriety, termed) is not to be perpetual. For the apo&s;tle Paul, &s;peaking no doubt, under immediate in&s;piration, expre&s;sly &s;ays, that when <HI>the end &s;hall come, that God &s;hall have &s;ubdued all things to his Son</HI> (in which, he ob&s;erves, that <HI>he mu&s;t be excepted who did &s;ubdue all thing unto him</HI>) <HI>he mu&s;t deliver up the kingdom to God, even the</HI> FATHER, <HI>and he him&s;elf &s;ubject to him who had put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 24. &amp;c. Nay, he him&s;elf &s;ays expres&s;ly, that he had not the di&s;po&s;al of the highe&s;t offices of his kingdom, Matt. xx. 23. <HI>To &s;it on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give; but it &s;hall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</HI></P>
<P>So clear, my brethren, &s;o full, and &s;o expre&s;s, is the uniform te&s;timony of the &s;criptures to the great doctrine of the proper <HI>unity of God,</HI> and of the &s;ubordination of Chri&s;t, and all other beings to him, that the prevalence of &s;o impious a doctrine, as the contrary mu&s;t be, can be a&s;cribed to nothing but to that <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity,</HI> which though it <HI>began to work</HI> in the times of the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, was not then ri&s;en to &s;o enormous a height as to at|tack the &s;upremacy of the <HI>one living and true God,</HI> and <HI>give his peculiar glory to another.</HI> This, my brethren, among other &s;hock|ing corruptions of genuine chri&s;tianity, grew up with the &s;y&s;tem of popery; and to &s;hew that nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to the &s;uper&s;tition and credulity of men, when they are <HI>become vain in their imagi|nations,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="018741_0015_0FA81B7C3B331720">
after exalting a man into a god, a creature into a creator, they made a piece of bread into one al&s;o, and then bowed down to, and wor&s;hipped, the work of their own hands.</P>
<P>But though it &s;eemed fit to the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom of God, that all the errors and abu&s;es of popery &s;hould not be reformed at once; and though this great error was left untouched by the fir&s;t reformers, ble&s;&s;ed be God the bible is as open to us as it was to them? and by the exertion of the &s;ame judgment and &s;pirit, we may free chri&s;tianity from the corruptions which they left adhering to it; and then among other excellencies of our religion, <HI>Our Lord will be one and his name one.</HI> Zech. xiv. 9.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k <HI>who,</HI> then, is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if he be not God; I an&s;wer, in the words of St. Peter, addre&s;&s;ed to the Jews, after his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, that <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth was a</HI> man <HI>ap|proved of God, by miracles and wonders and &s;igns, which God did by him.</HI> Acts ii. 22. If you a&s;k what is meant by <HI>man,</HI> in this place; I an&s;wer, that <HI>man,</HI> if the word be u&s;ed with any kind of proprie|ty, mu&s;t mean the &s;ame kind of being with your&s;elves. I &s;ay, moreover, with the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, that
<Q>it became him by whom are all things, and for whom are all things,</Q>
to make this great captain of our &s;alvation in all re&s;|pects, like unto us his brethren, that he might be made perfect through &s;ufferings. Heb. ii. 10.17. and that he might have a feeling of all our infirmities, iv. 13. For this rea&s;on it was that our Saviour and deliverer was not made of the nature of an <HI>angel,</HI> or like any &s;uper-angelic being, but was of <HI>the &s;eed of Abraham,</HI> ii. 16. that is (exclu&s;ive of the divinity of the Father, which re&s;ided in him, and acted by him) a mere <HI>man,</HI> as other Jews, and as we our|&s;elves al&s;o are.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t being made by the immediate hand of God, and not born in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of generation, is no rea&s;on for his not being con&s;idered as a man. For then Adam mu&s;t not have been a man. But in the ideas of St. Paul, both <HI>the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam</HI> (as Chri&s;t, on this account, is &s;ometimes called) were equally men; <HI>By man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 21. And, certainly, in the re&s;urrection of a <HI>man,</HI> that is, of a per&s;on in all re&s;pects like our&s;elves, we have a more <HI>lively hope</HI> of our own re&s;urrection; that of Chri&s;t being both a <HI>proof</HI> and a <HI>pattern</HI> of ours. We can, therefore, more firmly believe, that <HI>becau&s;e he lives, we</HI> who are the &s;ame that he was, and who &s;hall undergo the &s;ame change by death that He did, <HI>&s;hall live al&s;o.</HI> John xiv. 19.</P>
<P>Till this great corruption of chri&s;tianity be removed, it will be in vain to preach the go&s;pel to Jews, or Mahometans, or, indeed, to any people who retain the u&s;e of the rea&s;on and under&s;tanding that God has given them. For how is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>three</HI> per&s;ons, <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &s;hould be &s;eparately, each of them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all divine perfections, &s;o as to be <HI>true, very,</HI> and <HI>eter|nal</HI> God, and yet that there &s;hould be but <HI>one God;</HI> a truth which is
<PB N="17" REF="018741_0016_0FA81B7CD4B49D08">
&s;o clearly and fully revealed, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for men to re|fu&s;e their a&s;&s;ent to it; or el&s;e it would, no doubt, have been long ago expunged from our creed, as utterly irreconcileable with the more favourite doctrine of a <HI>Trinity,</HI> a term which is not to be found in the &s;criptures. Things <HI>above</HI> our rea&s;on may, for any thing that we know to the contrary be true; but things expres&s;ly <HI>contrary</HI> to our rea&s;on, as that <HI>three</HI> &s;hould be <HI>one</HI> and <HI>one three</HI> can never appear to us to be &s;o.</P>
<P>With the Jews, the doctrine of the Divine Unity is, and indeed ju&s;tly, con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fundamental principle of all religi|on. <HI>Hear O I&s;rael, the Lord Our God is one Lord,</HI> Deut. vi. 4. Mark xii. 29. To preach the doctrine of the Trinity to the Jews, can appear to them in no other light than an attempt to &s;educe them into <HI>idolatry,</HI> a thing which they dare not entertain the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of.</P>
<P>The great creed of the Mahometans, is, that <HI>There is one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</HI> Now that Mahomet is not the prophet of God, it is to be hoped they may, in time, be made to believe; but we mu&s;t not expect that they will &s;o ea&s;ily give up their faith in the unity of God. To make the go&s;pel what it was originally, <HI>glad tidings of great joy;</HI> and as at la&s;t it certainly will be to all the nations of the world, we mu&s;t free it from this mo&s;t ab&s;urd and impious doctrine, and al&s;o from many other corruptions which have been introduced into it. It can no otherwi&s;e appear worthy of God, and favourable to the virtue and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>Le&s;t &s;ome common objections &s;hould hinder the reception of the great truth here contended for, I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider and reply to the principle of them. It is often &s;aid that Chri&s;t &s;peaks of his <HI>humanity</HI> only, whenever he repre&s;ents him&s;elf as in|ferior to the Father, and dependent upon him. But the &s;criptures them&s;elves are far from furni&s;hing the lea&s;t hint of any &s;uch me|thod of interpretation, though, according to the Trinitarians, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the true under&s;tanding of them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, when it is applied to the pa&s;&s;ages in que&s;tion, it is far from making them either true in them&s;elves, or agreeable to the obvious purport and de&s;ign of the places in which they are in|troduced. I &s;hall ju&s;t mention a few. Could our Lord &s;ay with truth, and without an unworthy prevarication, that <HI>the Father is the only true God,</HI> John xvii. 3. if any other per&s;on, not implied in the term <HI>Father,</HI> was as much the true God as him&s;elf? Now the term <HI>Father</HI> being appropriated to what is called the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> per&s;on in the godhead, cannot comprehend the <HI>Son,</HI> who is called the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> This key, therefore, is of no &s;ervice in this ca&s;e, and our Lord, by expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf as he has done, could not but lead his hearers into what is called a dangerous mi&s;take.</P>
<P>When our Lord &s;aid that <HI>his Father was greater than he,</HI> did he make any re&s;erve, and &s;ecretly mean, not <HI>his whole &s;elf,</HI> but only <HI>part,</HI> and the inferior part of him&s;elf the other part being equal in power and glory with the Father? How mean the pre|varication, and how unworthy of our Lord!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="018741_0017_0FA81B7D92687A88">When our Lord &s;aid that <HI>the time of the day of judgment was not known to him&s;elf, the Son, but to the Father only,</HI> could he mean that his <HI>humanity</HI> only did not know it, but that his <HI>divinity</HI> (which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be intimately united with his humanity) was as well acquainted with it as the Father him&s;elf? If the human nature of Chri&s;t had been incapable of having that knowledge communicated to it, the declaration would have been needle&s;s; but as that was not the ca&s;e, his hearers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tand him as &s;peaking of him&s;elf in his highe&s;t capacity; as he certainly mu&s;t do, if at all, when he &s;peaks of him&s;elf as the <HI>Son,</HI> corre&s;ponding to the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>If Chri&s;t had not &s;atisfied the Jews that he did not mean to make him&s;elf equal with God, would they not have produced it again&s;t him at his trial, when he was condemned as a bla&s;phemer, becau&s;e he confe&s;&s;ed that he was the Chri&s;t only: and yet no Jew expected any thing more than a man for their Me&s;&s;iah, and our &s;aviour no where intimates that they were mi&s;taken in that expectation. It is plain that Martha con&s;idered our Lord as a different per&s;on from God, and dependent upon God, when &s;he &s;aid to him, John xi. 22. <HI>I know that even now, what&s;oever thou wilt a&s;k of God, God will give it thee.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> Of <HI>ATONEMENT</HI> for Sin by the Death of Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have been taught by divines, that if Chri&s;t be not God, he could not have made an <HI>infinite &s;atisfaction</HI> for the &s;ins of mankind. But, my brethren, where do you learn that the pardon of &s;in, in a finite creature, requires an infinite &s;atisfaction; or, indeed, any &s;atisfaction at all, be&s;ides repentance and reformation, on the part of a &s;inner. We read in the &s;criptures that we are <HI>ju&s;tified freely by the Grace of God,</HI> Rom. iii. 34. but what free grace, or mercy, does there appear to have been in God, if Chri&s;t gave a full price for our ju&s;tification, and bore the infinite weight of divine wrath on our account. We are commanded to <HI>forgive others, as we our&s;elves hope to be forgiven,</HI> Matt. vii. 14. and to be <HI>merciful, as our Father, who is in heaven, is merciful.</HI> But &s;urely we are not thereby authorized to in&s;i&s;t upon any atonement, or &s;atisfaction, before we give up our re&s;entment towards an offending and penitent brother. Indeed, how could it de&s;erve the name of <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> if we did? If he only <HI>repent,</HI> we are commanded to <HI>for|give</HI> him. Luke xvii. 4.</P>
<P>You read in the &s;criptures that Chri&s;t died a <HI>&s;acrifice for our &s;ins.</HI> Heb. ix. 26. So he did; and a &s;acrifice it was, of <HI>a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour to God.</HI> To die, as Chri&s;t did, in the glorious cau&s;e of truth and virtue; to die, as he did, in order to &s;how us an example of patiently &s;uffering death for our religion, and the good of man|kind, and in a firm hope of a re&s;urrection to a future and eternal

life; to die, as he did, in expre&s;s atte&s;tation of his own divine mi&s;&s;ion, by his manife&s;t re&s;urrection from the dead, and as the fulle&s;t proof of that doctrine, by means of which &s;inners are con|tinually reconciled unto God, was a noble &s;acrifice indeed. We al&s;o are commanded to <HI>yield our bodies living &s;acrifices.</HI> Rom. xii. 1. And we are required to offer the <HI>&s;acrifices of prai&s;e continually.</HI> P&s;al. cxvi. 17. But it is plain that all the&s;e are only figurative expre&s;&s;ions, and u&s;ed by way of compari&s;on. Neither our <HI>bodies,</HI> nor our <HI>prayers</HI> can be con&s;idered as <HI>real</HI> &s;acrifices; nor are we, therefore, obliged to &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t was a real &s;acrifice. And though we, like him, &s;hould be called actually to <HI>lay down our lives for our brethren,</HI> 1 John iii. 16. which, in imitation of him, we are enjoined to be ready to do, we &s;hould be &s;acrifices only in the figurative &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>It is true, that no man who is a &s;inner (and all men have &s;inned) can be <HI>ju&s;tified by his works.</HI> We all &s;tand in need of, and mu&s;t have recour&s;e to, <HI>free grace</HI> and <HI>mercy;</HI> but it is a great di&s;honour to God to &s;uppo&s;e that this mercy and grace takes its ri&s;e from any thing but his own e&s;&s;ential goodne&s;s; and that he is not <HI>of him&s;elf,</HI> and independent of all foreign con&s;iderations whatever, what he &s;olemnly declared him&s;elf to Mo&s;es, at the time of the giving of the law, to be, namely, <HI>a God merciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, abundant in goodne&s;s and in truth.</HI> Exod. xxxiv. 6. or that he re|quires any other &s;acrifices, but <HI>the &s;acrifices of a broken &s;pirit, and a contrite heart, which he will never de&s;pi&s;e.</HI> P&s;. li. 17.</P>
<P>Can we wi&s;h for a more di&s;tinct, and perfect repre&s;entation of the manner in which God forgives the &s;ins of his offspring of mankind, than our Saviour has exhibited to us in that mo&s;t excellent parable of the <HI>prodigal &s;on;</HI> in which the good father no &s;ooner &s;ees his child, who had abandoned him, and wa&s;ted his &s;ub&s;tance in riotous living, returning to him and to his duty; but without waiting for any atonement or propitiation, even <HI>while he was yet a great way off, he ran to him, fell upon his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him.</HI> Luke xv. 20. The &s;ame repre&s;entation we &s;ee in the parable of the creditor, who freely forgave his &s;ervant, becau&s;e he humbly <HI>de&s;ired</HI> him. Let us not then, my brethren, deprive the ever ble&s;&s;ed God of the mo&s;t glorious and honourable of all his attributes, and leave him nothing but <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> or rather <HI>vengeance,</HI> which is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid to be <HI>his &s;trange work.</HI> I&s;aiah xxviii. 21.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the doctrine of the &s;atisfaction for &s;in by the death of Chri&s;t, with the doctrine of <HI>free grace,</HI> which, according to the uniform tenet of the &s;criptures, is &s;o fully di&s;|played in the pardon of &s;in, and the ju&s;tification of &s;inners. When, therefore, the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, Rom. iii 24. <HI>That we are ju&s;tified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> the meaning of the latter clau&s;e mu&s;t be interpreted in &s;uch a manner as to make it con&s;i&s;tent with the former; and it is far from requiring any force or &s;training of the text to do it. For it is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e that our <HI>redemption</HI> (or, as the word pro|perly
<PB N="20" REF="018741_0019_0FA81B8155C74D58">
&s;ignifies, and is indeed frequently rendered by our tran&s;lators, our <HI>deliverance</HI>) from the power of &s;in, <HI>i. e.</HI> our repentance and reformation, without which there is no promi&s;e of pardon, is effected by the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who came <HI>to call &s;inners to repentance;</HI> but &s;till God is to be con&s;idered as the <HI>giver,</HI> and not the <HI>receiver</HI> with re&s;pect to our redemption, for we read that <HI>he &s;pared not his own &s;on, but gave him up for us all.</HI> Rom. viii. 32.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that God the Father provided an atonement for his own offended ju&s;tice is, in fact, to give up the doctrine. If a per&s;on owe me a &s;um of money, and I chu&s;e to have the debt di&s;charged, is it not the &s;ame thing, whether I remit the debt at once, or &s;upply another per&s;on with money wherewith to pay me to the debtor's name? If &s;atisfaction be made to any purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t be in &s;ome manner, in which the offender may be a &s;ufferer, and the offended per&s;on a gainer; but it can never be reconciled to equity, or an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e whatever, to make the inno|cent &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of the guilty. If, as Abraham &s;ays, it be <HI>far from God to &s;lay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous &s;hould be as the wicked,</HI> Gen. xviii. 25. much far|ther mu&s;t it be from him to &s;lay the righteous <HI>in&s;tead</HI> of the wicked.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the zealous advocates for this doctrine would con&s;ider, that if it be nece&s;&s;ary, in the nature of things, that the ju&s;tice of God be &s;atisfied before any &s;in can be pardoned, and Chri&s;t be God as well as the Father, whether the ju&s;tice of Chri&s;t ought not to have been &s;atisfied in the fir&s;t place. If &s;o, what other infinite being has made &s;atisfaction to him? But if the divine nature of the Son required no &s;atisfaction, why &s;hould the divine nature of the Father require any?</P>
<P>If it had been incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine ju&s;tice to pardon &s;in upon repentance only, without &s;ome farther &s;atisfaction, we might have expected to have found it <HI>expre&s;sly &s;aid to be &s;o</HI> in the &s;criptures; but no &s;uch declaration can be produced either from the Old or the New Te&s;tament. All that can be pretended is, that it may be <HI>inferred</HI> from it. Though good works are recom|mended to us in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, it is never with any &s;alvo or caution, as if they were not <HI>of them&s;elves</HI> acceptable to God. The declarations of the divine mercy to the penitent are all ab&s;o|lute, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of their having a reference to any <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> on which they are made. <HI>Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</HI> P&s;alm lxxxiv. 5. <HI>To the Lord our God be|long mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es, though we have rebelled again&s;t him.</HI> Dan. ix. 3. When David and other penitents confe&s;s their &s;ins, and intreat for pardon, they refer them&s;elves to the divine mercy only, without &s;eeming to have the lea&s;t idea of any thing farther. <HI>Remember not the &s;ins of my youth, nor my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodne&s;s &s;ake, O Lord.</HI> P&s;alm xxv. 6.</P>
<P>It is particularly remarkable, that when &s;acrifices under the law are expre&s;sly &s;aid not to be &s;ufficient for the pardon of &s;in, we are
<PB N="21" REF="018741_0020_0FA81B82D2ABA1F0">
never referred to any <HI>more availing &s;acrifice;</HI> but to good works only.
<Q>Thou de&s;ire&s;t not &s;acrifice, el&s;e would I give it; thou delighte&s;t not in burnt offering. The &s;acrifices of the Lord are a broken &s;pirit A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e. P&s;alm li. 16 17.</Q>
If any of the Jews had had the lea&s;t notion of the nece&s;&s;ity of any atonement for the &s;ins of mankind, they could not but have expected a <HI>&s;uffering Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> and yet it is plain that the very be&s;t of them had no &s;uch idea. And though our Saviour frequently explains the rea&s;on of his coming, and the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;uffering, it is never on any &s;uch account. If he had done it any where, it might have been expected in tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es by which he endeavoured to reconcile his di&s;ciples to his death, in his &s;olemn prayer before his &s;uffer|ings, at the time of his agony in the garden, or when he was up|on the cro&s;s; yet nothing of this kind drops from him on any of the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When our Lord de&s;cribes the proceedings of the day of judg|ment, he doth not repre&s;ent the righteous as referring them&s;elves to the &s;ufferings or merit of their judge for their ju&s;tification; and the judge him&s;elf expre&s;sly grounds it on their good works only. Though St. Peter, in his di&s;cour&s;e to the Jews on the day of Pente|co&s;t, &s;peaks of their &s;in in murdering Chri&s;t as of a heinous na|ture, he &s;ays not a word of the nece&s;&s;ity of any atonement, or that an ample &s;atisfaction had ju&s;t been made, by means of their very wickedne&s;s. How would a modern divine have harangued upon the occa&s;ion, and what advantage might he have taken of the cry of the Jews, <HI>His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</HI> But St. Peter only exhorts to repentance, and &s;peaks of the death of Chri&s;t as an event that took place according to the foreknow|ledge of God.</P>
<P>All the di&s;cour&s;es of St. Paul upon various occa&s;ions in the book of Acts, are entirely moral. In his celebrated &s;peech at Athens, he only urges his hearers to repentance, from the con&s;i|deration of a future judgment. He &s;ays not a word of what is now called the true go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In &s;hort, it is only from the literal interpretation of a few figurative expre&s;&s;ions in the &s;criptures that this doctrine of <HI>atonement,</HI> as well as that of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tantiation</HI> has been derived; and it is certainly a doctrine highly injurious to God; and if we, who are commanded to imi|tate God, &s;hould act upon the maxims of it, it would be &s;ubver|&s;ive of the mo&s;t amiable part of virtue in men. We &s;hould be implacable and unmerciful, in&s;i&s;ting upon the uttermo&s;t farthing.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my brethren, are the principal heads on which I propo|&s;ed to expo&s;tulate with you, in the plain and free manner in which I have done. Do you your&s;elves,
<Q>&s;earch the &s;criptures and &s;ee whether the&s;e things be &s;o. Pray to the God of truth to lead you into all truth, and may he give you under&s;tanding in all things.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Practical Con&s;equences of the above Doctrines.</HEAD>
<P>THE found knowledge of chri&s;tianity is not of importance as a matter of <HI>&s;peculation</HI> merely; though ab&s;tract truths, e&s;pecially truths that relate to God, and the maxims of his moral government, are not without their utility and obligation; but the truths that I here contend for nearly affect the &s;entiments of our hearts, and our conduct in life; as, indeed, has been &s;hewn in many re&s;pects, already. Con&s;idering God as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the character in which &s;ome divines repre&s;ent him, it is impo&s;&s;ible, while human nature is what it is, that he &s;hould appear in an amiable or re&s;|pectable light. Such a God may, indeed, be the object of <HI>dread</HI> and <HI>terror</HI> to his creatures; but by no means of their <HI>love</HI> or <HI>reverence.</HI> And what is obedience without love? It cannot be that of the <HI>heart,</HI> which, however, is the only thing that is of any real value in religion. Al&s;o, how can a man love his fellow-creatures in general, when he con&s;iders the greate&s;t part of them as the objects of the divine abhorrence, and doomed by him to an everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction, in which he believes that he him&s;elf mu&s;t for ever rejoice? And what can remain of virtue, when the&s;e two great &s;ources of it, the <HI>love of God and of mankind,</HI> are thus gro&s;sly cor|rupted? La&s;tly, how mu&s;t the genuine &s;pirit of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>forgive|ne&s;s,</HI> which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, be deba&s;ed, when God him&s;elf (who&s;e conduct in this very re&s;pect is particularly propo&s;ed to our imitation) is con&s;idered as never for|giving &s;in without &s;ome previous atonement, &s;atisfaction, or interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, loving God, as the compa&s;&s;ionate Father of all his offspring, as <HI>willing that all men &s;hould be &s;aved, and come to the knowledge of his truth;</HI> and al&s;o loving all mankind as our brethren, as, together with our&s;elves, the children of the &s;ame gracious Father, we cannot want the mo&s;t generous and powerful motives <HI>to do the will of God,</HI> and <HI>to provoke one another to love, and to good works;</HI> being in no fear of counteracting the &s;ecret de&s;igns of the Almighty, which we believe are aimed, not at the de&s;truction, but the happine&s;s of all his creatures.</P>
<P>Think not, however, that I am &s;o uncharitable as to &s;uppo&s;e that all tho&s;e who profe&s;s to maintain the doctrines I have been arguing again&s;t, are univer&s;ally de&s;titute of the genuine love of God, or of their fellow-creatures. I am &s;en&s;ible, and truly thankful, that it is not always the con&s;equence; but it is becau&s;e the hearts of &s;uch per&s;ons are really influenced by better principles than tho&s;e which they avow. They by no means habitually regard the Divine Being in the light in which their principles repre&s;ent him, but as the <HI>true Father</HI> of all the creatures that he has made, and, as &s;uch, &s;incerely de&s;irous to promote their be&s;t intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, notwith&s;tanding, if they be a&s;ked, they will not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t is God, the &s;upremacy of the Father, even with re&s;pect to the Son, is, at the &s;ame time, the real &s;entiment,
<PB N="23" REF="018741_0022_0FA81B840BED0638">
of their Minds; and when they lift up their hearts to God, it is only <HI>God the Father</HI> that is the proper object of their adoration. The con&s;tant tenor of the &s;criptures is &s;o contrary to their profe&s;&s;ed creed, that though they dare not call it in que&s;tion, it is not able to counteract the plainer, the more con&s;i&s;tent, and the better prin|ciples which will force them&s;elves upon their minds from conver&s;ing with the bible.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it requires more &s;ubtilty and refinement to enter into the principles above-mentioned, than the common people are ma&s;ters of. They cannot conceive how one man &s;hould &s;in, and another per&s;on, &s;ix thou&s;and years after, be guilty of that &s;in, and puni&s;hable for it; how one per&s;on's righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould be con|&s;idered as the righteou&s;ne&s;s of another; or that three di&s;tinct per&s;ons &s;hould each of them be God, and yet that there &s;hould be no more gods than one.</P>
<P>Men of plain under&s;tandings, in fact, never do believe any &s;uch thing; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the go&s;pel, which was intended to be the &s;olid foundation of the faith, hope, and joy of common people, &s;hould require &s;o much acutene&s;s, as is nece&s;&s;ary to give even a plau&s;ible colour to the&s;e &s;trange a&s;&s;ertions. The attempt to explain them (and, till they be explained, they can no more be believed, than a propo&s;ition in an unkown tongue) can lead to nothing but endle&s;s and unprofitable contro|ver&s;y. It is happy, therefore, that &s;o many per&s;ons make a better u&s;e of the go&s;pel than their tenets would lead them to do, and that they con&s;ider it chiefly as <HI>a rule of life,</HI> and the <HI>foundation of hope after death.</HI> But, as far as the principles I have been arguing again&s;t are believed, they cannot but do harm to tho&s;e who entertain them, as well as bring di&s;grace upon the chri&s;tian name; both which every <HI>lover of the go&s;pel</HI> &s;hould endeavour to prevent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> A conci&s;e Hi&s;tory of Opinions concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will &s;ay, If Chri&s;t be not really <HI>God,</HI> but merely <HI>a man,</HI> though in&s;pired and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by God, how came the chri&s;tian world to fall into &s;o great an error? In return, I might a&s;k, how, if Chri&s;t be truly God, equal to the Father, &s;o many chri&s;tians, and e&s;pecially the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians, and many others in the very early ages of the chri&s;tian church came to think him to be merely a man; when it may be ea&s;ily conceived that, on many accounts, chri&s;tians, who were continually reproached with the meanne&s;s of their ma&s;ter, would be di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>add to,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="018741_0023_0FA81B845796A2A0">
rather than to <HI>take from</HI> his dignity? But it is not difficult to &s;hew by what <HI>means,</HI> and by what <HI>&s;teps,</HI> chri&s;tians came to think as the generality of them now do.</P>
<P>It was the univer&s;al opinion of philo&s;ophers, at the time of the promulgation of chri&s;tianity, that the &s;ouls of all men had exi&s;ted before they were &s;ent to animate the bodies that were provided for them here, and al&s;o that all &s;ouls were <HI>emanations,</HI> or <HI>parts detached</HI> from the deity. For at that time there was no idea of any &s;ub|&s;tance being properly <HI>immaterial,</HI> and <HI>indivi&s;ible.</HI> When the&s;e philo&s;ophers became chri&s;tians, and yet were a&s;hamed of being the di&s;ciples of a man who had been crucified, they naturally gave a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank to the &s;oul of Chri&s;t before he came into the world. They even went one &s;tep farther, and maintained that Chri&s;t had a body in appearance only, and not in reality, and therefore that he &s;uffered nothing at all when he was &s;courged and crucified.</P>
<P>This opinion the apo&s;tle John reprobates with great &s;everity, and even calls it <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> 1 John iv. 3. whereas though it is acknowledged that the other opinion, viz. that of Chri&s;t being <HI>merely a man,</HI> exi&s;ted in the times of the apo&s;tles, it is remarkable that this apo&s;tle takes no notice of it. It was plainly the doctrine of tho&s;e only who maintained that Chri&s;t was not truly a man that gave this apo&s;tle any di&s;turbance, or he could never have &s;aid as he does, 1 John iv. 2. <HI>Every &s;pirit that confe&s;&s;es that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h</HI> (that is, was truly a man) <HI>is of God.</HI></P>
<P>After this, philo&s;ophizing chri&s;tians began to add to the pre-exi&s;tent dignity of Chri&s;t in another way, and at length carried it much higher than tho&s;e upon whom this apo&s;tle animadverted with &s;o much &s;everity. They &s;aid that Chri&s;t was originally <HI>in God,</HI> being his <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> or <HI>logos,</HI> which came <HI>out of him,</HI> and was <HI>per&s;onified</HI> before the creation of the world, in which he was the immediate agent, and that this new per&s;onage was henceforth the medium of all the divine communications to mankind, having been the per&s;on who &s;pake to Adam in Paradi&s;e, to Noah, to Abraham, and all the patriarchs, who delivered the law from mount Sinai, and la&s;tly inhabited the body of Je&s;us of Nazareth.</P>
<P>On this principle they explained many pa&s;&s;ages in the Old Te&s;tament, in which the <HI>word of God</HI> is &s;poken of, as that of the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>by the word of the Lord were the heavens made,</HI> &amp;c. making this <HI>word</HI> to be <HI>a per&s;on,</HI> di&s;tinct from God, who&s;e word it was; whereas nothing can be more plain, then that by the <HI>word of God</HI> in this place, is meant the <HI>power of God,</HI> exerted with as much ea&s;e as men utter words.</P>
<P>The&s;e philo&s;ophizing chri&s;tians, took great pains to explain how the <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> or <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of God could thus become a per&s;on, di&s;tinct from God, and yet God continue a rea&s;onable being; but their account of it is too trifling to be recited in this place. However, it was far from being pretended, in general, that the doctrine of the divinity of Chri&s;t was &s;uch a my&s;tery as could
<PB N="25" REF="018741_0024_0FA81B851E5B06D0">
not be explained. For by <HI>my&s;tery</HI> they only meant &s;omething of a &s;olemn nature, which was unknown till it was revealed or explain|ed. And indeed this is plainly the u&s;e of the word <HI>my&s;tery</HI> in the New Te&s;tament; and it was al&s;o the u&s;ual meaning of the word when the pre&s;ent tran&s;lation of the bible was made; the <HI>my&s;teries of any particular trade</HI> being the <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> of that trade, which yet every ma&s;ter taught his apprentices.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate the doctrine continued till after the council of Nice, in the year of our Lord, 325; but in all this time a real &s;uperiority was always acknowledged in the Father, as the only &s;ource of divinity; and it was even explicitly acknowledged that there was a time when the &s;on of God had no &s;eparate exi&s;tence, being only the <HI>rea&s;on of God,</HI> ju&s;t as the rea&s;on of man is a part, or a property, of man. One of the mo&s;t eminent of the chri&s;tian Fathers &s;ays,
<Q>There was a time when God was neither a Father, nor a judge; for he could not be a Father before he had a &s;on, nor a judge before there was &s;in.</Q></P>
<P>So far were they from &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;on of God to be <HI>Equal to the Father,</HI> that when they were charged, as they frequently were, with making <HI>two Gods,</HI> they generally replied, that the &s;on was only <HI>God of God,</HI> as having proceeded from a &s;uperior God, which is the language of the Nicene Creed; whereas the Father was <HI>God of him&s;elf (autotheos</HI>) by which they meant <HI>underived,</HI> which they held to be the prerogative of the Father only.</P>
<P>In all this time the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians who were not tainted with the heathen philo&s;ophy, maintained the doctrine of the proper and &s;imple humanity of Chri&s;t. Athana&s;ius him&s;elf was &s;o far from being able to deny this, that he &s;ays all the Jews were &s;o fully per&s;uaded that their Me&s;&s;iah was to be a man like them&s;elves, that the apo&s;tles were obliged to u&s;e great caution in divulging the doctrine of the divinity of Chri&s;t. He &s;ays that the rea&s;on why Peter, Acts ii. 22. only calls him <HI>a man approved of God,</HI> and why, on other occa&s;ions in the cour&s;e of that book, and other parts of the New Te&s;tament, he is &s;imply called <HI>a man,</HI> was that at fir&s;t the apo&s;tles did not think proper to do more than prove that Je&s;us was the <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> a Me&s;&s;iah, and that they thought it prudent to divulge the doctrine of the divinity of Chri&s;t by degrees. He likewi&s;e &s;ays, that the Jews of tho&s;e times, meaning the Jewi&s;h Chri&s;tians, being in this error them&s;elves drew the Gentiles into it. Athana&s;ius greatly commends the apo&s;tles for this addre&s;s in their circum&s;tances. But what the apo&s;tles &s;crupled to teach, we &s;hould be &s;crupulous in believing.</P>
<P>It al&s;o clearly appears from eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that the un|learned among the chri&s;tians were exceedingly aver&s;e to the doc|trine of the divinity of Chri&s;t, even in the qualified &s;en&s;e above mentioned, oppo&s;ing what they called the &s;upreme <HI>monarchy</HI> of the Father to the novel doctrine of the divinity of the Son; and the philo&s;ophi&s;ing chri&s;tians were obliged to make laboured apo|logies to the&s;e early unitarians, acknowledging the perfect infe|riority
<PB N="26" REF="018741_0025_0FA81B85DC387CC0">
of he Son to the Father. But at length the&s;e unitarians were over-borne by the &s;uperior influence and popularity of their ad|ver&s;aries, who, from believing Chri&s;t to be God in an inferior and qualified &s;en&s;e of the word, came, in the natural cour&s;e of things, to believe him to be God equal to the Father him&s;elf, and to have exi&s;ted from all eternity indepently of him. But it was &s;everal cen|turies before this doctrine was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. And the Holy &s;pirit was generally con&s;idered either as the &s;ame thing with <HI>the power of God,</HI> that is God him&s;elf (ju&s;t as the <HI>&s;pirit of a man</HI> is a man) or el&s;e a &s;uper-angelic being, inferior both to the Father and the Son, till after the council of Nice.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Arius and his followers, &s;hocked at the doctrine of Chri&s;t being of <HI>the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance</HI> with the Father, maintained that, though he had pre-exi&s;ted, and had been the medium of all the dipen&s;ations of God to mankind, he was, like all other deri|ved beings, <HI>created out of nothing;</HI> the opinion of all &s;ouls having been emanations from the &s;upreme mind being then generally denied by chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Thus did it plea&s;e God, for rea&s;ons unknown to us, to permit the ri&s;e and general &s;pread of the trinitarian and arian opinions, as he permitted the ri&s;e and amazing power of the <HI>man of &s;in,</HI> and many corruptions and abu&s;es of chri&s;tianity utterly &s;ubver&s;ive of the genuine purity of the go&s;pel, till the full time for the reformation of this and other gro&s;s corruptions of chri&s;tianity was come.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> A conci&s;e Hi&s;tory of the Doctrines of Grace, Original Sin, and Prede&s;tination.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a controver&s;y about the nature and u&s;e of bapti&s;m that occa&s;ioned the &s;tarting of the doctrine of <HI>the natural impotence of man to do what God requires of him,</HI> of the imputation of the <HI>&s;in of Adam</HI> to all his po&s;terity, and of the arbitrary <HI>prede&s;tination</HI> of certain individuals of the human race to everla&s;ting life, while the re&s;t of mankind were left in a &s;tate of <HI>reprobation;</HI> and this was &s;o late as four hundred years after Chri&s;t. Before that time it had been the univer&s;al opinion of chri&s;tians, and of Au&s;tin him&s;elf, who fir&s;t advanced the doctrines above-mentioned, that every man has the power of obeying or di&s;obeying the laws of God, that all men may be &s;aved if they will, and that no decrees of God will be the lea&s;t ob&s;truction in the way of any man's &s;alvation.</P>
<P>But Pelagius, a man of good under&s;tanding, and exemplary morals, in his declamations again&s;t &s;ome abu&s;es of bapti&s;m, a&s;&s;erting that bapti&s;m it&s;elf does not wa&s;h away &s;in, as was then generally &s;uppo&s;ed (on which account it was the cu&s;tom with many to defend it till near death) nor could have been appointed for that purpo&s;e, becau&s;e infants, which have no &s;in, are bapti&s;ed, Au&s;tin in oppo&s;ition to him maintained that, though infants have no <HI>actual &s;in</HI> of their own, they have the &s;tain of <HI>original &s;in</HI> in which they were born; though he was far from a&s;&s;erting that Adam was the <HI>federal head</HI> of all his po&s;terity, and that his &s;in was properly <HI>imputed</HI> to them.
<PB N="27" REF="018741_0026_0FA81B86B2971490">
This was an improvement upon the doctrine in after ages. What Au&s;tin maintained was, that men derive a <HI>corrupt nature,</HI> or a <HI>pronene&s;s to &s;in,</HI> from Adam.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, having been led, in the cour&s;e of this controver&s;y, to a&s;&s;ert that by means of original &s;in no man had it in his power to attain to &s;alvation, he was obliged to maintain that it depended upon the <HI>will of God</HI> only who &s;hould be finally &s;aved, and that he <HI>prede&s;tinated</HI> whom he thought proper for that purpo&s;e, indepen|dent of any fore&s;ight of their good works, which it was not in their power to perform without his immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in which he mu&s;t be the fir&s;t mover.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this doctrine of the corruption of human nature, the nece&s;&s;ity of divine grace for the production of every good thought or action, and the prede&s;tination to eternal life with|out regard to good works, advanced by Au&s;tin, prevailed in the we&s;t, chiefly through the authority of his name, it was never re|ceived in the ea&s;tern church, and was much controverted, and held with various modifications, in the we&s;tern. Al&s;o, together with this doctrine of grace, the divines of the Roman Catholic church held the doctrine of <HI>human merit,</HI> founded on the right u&s;e of the grace of God to man. And the pre&s;ent doctrines of <HI>grace, original &s;in,</HI> and <HI>prede&s;tination,</HI> were never maintained in their full extent till after the reformation by Luther, who was a friar of the order of Au&s;tin, had been much attached to his doctrines, and made great u&s;e of them in oppo&s;ing the popi&s;h doctrines, of <HI>indulgence,</HI> founded on that of <HI>merit.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> A conci&s;e Hi&s;tory of the Doctrine of Atonement.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of <HI>atonement,</HI> or of the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;atisfaction</HI> being made to the ju&s;tice of God by the death of Chri&s;t, in order to his remitting the &s;ins of men, aro&s;e from an abu&s;e of the figurative language of &s;cripture, as the doctrine of <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tanti|ation</HI> al&s;o did. But for &s;everal centuries the&s;e figurative expre&s;&s;i|ons were under&s;tood and applied in a manner very different from what they now are.</P>
<P>It was granted by &s;ome pretty early writers, that we were <HI>bought</HI> (or <HI>redeemed</HI>) <HI>with a price;</HI> but then, as we had been the &s;laves of <HI>&s;in,</HI> and were redeemed by God, who ran&s;omed us by the death of his &s;on, it was maintained till after the time of Au&s;tin (the principal author of all the rigid doctrines that are now called <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI>) that the price of our redemption was paid not <HI>to</HI> God, but <HI>by</HI> God, to the <HI>devil,</HI> in who&s;e power we were. Of this opinion was Au&s;tin him&s;elf, who wrote largely on the &s;ubject in his treati&s;e on the doctrine of the trinity. It was long after his time before we find any traces of it, being generally thought that the price of redemption was paid to the offended ju&s;tice of God; and the pre&s;ent doctrine of atonement, founded on the idea of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of an infinite &s;atisfaction being made by
<PB N="28" REF="018741_0027_0FA81B87A3B39E30">
one infinite being for offences of an infinite magnitude, as com|mited again&s;t another infinite being, is &s;ub&s;equent to the refor|mation. This doctrine was advanced by the reformers in the cour&s;e of their controver&s;y with the Papi&s;ts, about the doctrine of human merit, works of penance, and the power of granting in|dulgences. Now can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a doctrine of &s;o much importance, as this is always repre&s;ented to be, &s;hould have been unknown &s;o many ages?</P>
<P>Thus all the&s;e boa&s;ted ancient doctrines are in fact of late date, either having ari&s;en from the principles of heathen philo&s;ophy, or having been &s;tarted and extended in the cour&s;e of controver&s;y, one fal&s;e po&s;ition making another nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport; and an air of awful and deep <HI>my&s;tery</HI> has been no &s;mall recommendation of them to many of the more ignorant.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the <HI>trinity,</HI> having been one of the earlie&s;t, corruptions of chri&s;tianity, will probably be one of the la&s;t to be completely eradicated. But the time, I tru&s;t, is fa&s;t approaching, when, by means of the zeal of truly enlightened and good men in this great cau&s;e, this fundamental error, which gives &s;uch great and ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to Jews and Mahometans, will be removed, and all that has been built upon it will fall to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>MY Chri&s;tian brethren, if the reading of this addre&s;s give ri&s;e to any <HI>doubts</HI> or <HI>&s;cruples</HI> in your minds, with re&s;pect to &s;ome doctrines which you have been u&s;ed to con&s;ider as true and <HI>fundamental</HI> in the chri&s;tian religion, inquire farther; and if you be <HI>&s;atisfied</HI> that you have hitherto been mi&s;taken, dare to avow the truth, and act con&s;i&s;tently with it. Dread the con&s;equences of joining, with an enlightened mind, in the <HI>idolatrous wor&s;hip of any creature,</HI> though enjoined by any human authority; re|membering the words of Chri&s;t, <HI>thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI> Matt. iv. 10. and al&s;o that awful voice from heaven re&s;pecting all antichri&s;tian corruptions of the go&s;pel, in my&s;tical Babylon; <HI>Come out of her, my people that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> Rev. xviii. 4.</P>
<P>Think not to avail your&s;elves of the wretched equivocation of many divines, who imagine that they may &s;afely a&s;cribe all divine honours to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on account of his <HI>union with the Father,</HI> when they believe no more of his <HI>proper divinity,</HI> than profe&s;&s;ed Arians or Socinians. By this artifice they &s;ecure the reputation and emoluments of orthodoxy; but let them con&s;ider the value of the purcha&s;e, and the price they give for it. To mere wordly con|&s;iderations, to the <HI>prai&s;e</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> and <HI>filthy lucre,</HI> they &s;acrifice that <HI>integrity,</HI> for the lo&s;s of which worlds cannot compen&s;ate.</P>
<P>The publi&s;her of the&s;e tracts does not conceal his name through the fear of any thing that <HI>men</HI> can <HI>&s;ay of him,</HI> or <HI>do to
<PB N="29" REF="018741_0028_0FA81B88D209AD00">
him,</HI> but merely to give what he has written a better chance of being read without prejudice. What he has done is out of a &s;incere good-will and compa&s;&s;ion to the multitude, who believe they know not what, or why, and what is of more con&s;equence, who <HI>know not what &s;pirit they are of;</HI> but in&s;tead of <HI>&s;peaking the truth in love,</HI> mi&s;take bitterne&s;s and rancour for a zeal for God and his truth, and al&s;o for the &s;ake of a better &s;ort of people, who are unhappily drawn into the &s;ame delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Authors name was not printed in the fir&s;t Edition.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the deference which the common people always pay to the judgment of men of learning, there can be little doubt but that, if tho&s;e per&s;ons who, having &s;tudied this &s;ubject, have been convinced that Chri&s;t is not God, and ought not to be wor|&s;hipped as God, had openly avowed their opinion, and had had recour&s;e to no mean &s;ubterfuge or equivocation, this fundamental article of true and rational chri&s;tianity had long ago been the prevailing belief; and our religion appearing more worthy of its divine author, there would have been at this time fewer unbelievers in all chri&s;tian countries, and many more converts made to it from other religions. And, compared with this glorious advantage, what has been gained by all the arts and &s;ophi&s;try of mini&s;ters, who have concealed their real meaning under ambiguous expre&s;|&s;ions, le&s;t, as they pretend, they &s;hould too much &s;hock the preju|dices of their hearers?</P>
<P>That &s;ome regard &s;hould be paid to the prejudices of the <HI>weak</HI> is allowed; but let not this lead men to criminal di&s;&s;imulation, or extend to things of &s;o much importance as this, re&s;pecting the <HI>unity of God.</HI> In this ca&s;e, let us keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from every thing that is <HI>di&s;ingenuous;</HI> let the truth be &s;poken in the mo&s;t explicit manner, and let the con&s;equences be left to the <HI>power of truth,</HI> and the <HI>God of truth.</HI> Be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible that while men retain depraved and unworthy notions of God, their devotion &s;hould be &s;uch as God requires; &s;o that this pre|tended tenderne&s;s injures tho&s;e who are the objects of it, as well as bears an unfavourable a&s;pect on the intere&s;ts of chri&s;tianity more at large. Such are the effects of the <HI>wi&s;dom of this world,</HI> when it is put in the place of <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> and a regard to the plain <HI>truth of the go&s;pel</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;ing the purity of the chri&s;tian faith, let us be careful, my brethren, to adorn it by a blamele&s;s and exemplary life.

and by being always ready to do them every kind office in our power.</P>
<P>To judge of our love to God, or of our love to Chri&s;t, directly, by what we <HI>feel</HI> when we think of them, e&s;pecially when we are excluded from the world, as is the cu&s;tom with many, is to ex|po&s;e our&s;elves to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous delu&s;ions. We find in the &s;criptures a much plainer, and &s;afer method of judg|ing in both the&s;e ca&s;es.
<Q>This, <HI>&s;ays the apo&s;tle John,</HI> is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. If ye love me, <HI>&s;ays our Lord,</HI> keep my commandments. Ye are my friends, if ye do what&s;oever I command you; <HI>and</HI> this is my command|ment, that ye love one another. By this &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one for another.</Q></P>
<P>Remember that true chri&s;tian charity is humble, mode&s;t, and diffident; and that he is pronounced to be happy, who <HI>feareth always,</HI> &s;o as to be circum&s;pect in thought, word, and deed; and that, for this purpo&s;e, we are to <HI>put on the whole armour of God,</HI> that we may with&s;tand the temptations of the world.</P>
<P>Rather than indulge a Phari&s;aical pride, in recounting your <HI>experiences,</HI> boa&s;ting how vile you have once been, or thought your&s;elves to be, in order to make others believe how holy and &s;anctified you are now, content your&s;elves with the language and practice of the humble publican, who, &s;peaking to God and his own heart only, cried, <HI>God be merciful to me a &s;inner.</HI></P>
<P>Rejoice in all the real good you &s;ee done by others, whatever may be their ill will, or oppo&s;ition to you; and be e&s;pecially upon your guard, le&s;t your ju&s;t aver&s;ion to what is corrupt in the principles or practices of others, lead you to di&s;like what is good in them. Let not the <HI>Phari&s;aical rigour</HI> of &s;ome throw you into the oppo&s;ite extreme of <HI>levity;</HI> and let not their laying an undue &s;tre&s;s upon praying, preaching, and other means of religion, make you neglect them as we are too apt to do, with re&s;pect to any thing that has been much abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having enough to do with our own hearts, let us be particular|ly upon our guard again&s;t that &s;pirit of <HI>cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which ma|ny profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians indulge with too little re&s;traint. Let us remember that the true chri&s;tian <HI>beareth all things and hopeth all things;</HI> and let us never forget the awful warning of our Lord, "Judge not that ye be not judged: for with what judgment ye "judge, ye &s;hall be judged; and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</P>
<P>Be not moved, my Brethren, by the ra&s;h cen&s;ures and reproach|es of others.
<Q>Per&s;ecution, <HI>of &s;ome kind is what</HI> all who live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer in this world. <HI>To their</HI> wrath, anger, clamour, evil &s;peaking, and malice, <HI>an|&s;wer with</HI> the wi&s;dom that is from above; which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated; full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y.</Q>

<P>You will be called <HI>Arminians</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> by your adver&s;aries, or &s;omething el&s;e that &s;hall expre&s;s more of their hatred and di&s;|like. But let not this offend you. If there be any proper mean|ing in tho&s;e epithets, it can only be that you hold certain opinions which they deem to be fal&s;e, but which you cheri&s;h, as the only genuine doctrines of the go&s;pel. If nothing more is meant by tho&s;e terms, be&s;ides mere <HI>reproach</HI> and <HI>abu&s;e,</HI> think your&s;elves happy, as being <HI>reproached for the name of Chri&s;t.</HI> 1 Peter, iv. 14.

<P>If we be Chri&s;tians indeed, we &s;hall con&s;ider our&s;elves as <HI>not of this world,</HI> but <HI>as citizens of heaven. The friend&s;hip of this world,</HI> therefore, together with popularity, and &s;ucce&s;s in it, ought not to be con&s;idered as any object for us. If we <HI>abide in Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>walk even as he al&s;o walked,</HI> not <HI>being conformed to this world, but being transformed by the renewing of our minds,</HI> we are <HI>heirs of a far</HI> nobler inheritance, <HI>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re&s;erved in heaven for us;</HI> and <HI>when Chri&s;t, who is our life, and for whom we &s;uffer reproach &s;hall ap|pear, we al&s;o &s;hall appear with him in glory.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this addre&s;s with a word of advice and exhor|tation to all <HI>unitarians,</HI> whether they be members of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church or of any &s;ociety of <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this country.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch great importance is the doctrine of the <HI>divine unity;</HI> that nothing will more fully ju&s;tify a &s;eparation from any chri&s;tian church that does not openly profe&s;s it, and much more from tho&s;e that avow the contrary doctrine, directing prayers, and paying &s;upreme wor&s;hip, to any other than the <HI>God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It was for the pre&s;ervation of this great and fundamental doc|trine, that Abraham, and his family by I&s;aac and Jacob, were &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, and made a di&s;tinct people, as it were to be the depo&s;itaries of the true religion, which con|&s;i&s;ts principally in the &s;ole wor&s;hip of the one true and living God, the maker and pre&s;erver of all things. The &s;ame important doctrine was uniformly taught by Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles; though chri&s;tians in after times, like the I&s;raelites after the time of Jo&s;hua, relap&s;ed into that idolatry which has generally prevailed to this day</P>
<P>If it was a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification of the fir&s;t reformers, that they con&s;idered the church from which they &s;eparated as wor&s;hipping
<PB N="32" REF="018741_0031_0FA81B8D48D323D8">
&s;aints and angels; will it not ju&s;tify your &s;eparation from their partial reformations, that you con&s;ider them as praying to and wor&s;hipping one whom you con&s;ider as a <HI>man</HI> like your&s;elves, though honoured and di&s;tingui&s;hed by God above all other men?</P>
<P>To join habitually in public wor&s;hip with trinitarians, is countenancing that wor&s;hip, which you mu&s;t con&s;ider as <HI>idolatrous;</HI> and which, however innocent in them, is highly criminal in you. If they think it a point of con&s;cience not to go to ma&s;s in popi&s;h churches becau&s;e, in their opinion, it is idolizing a <HI>piece of bread,</HI> you ought to make a point of con&s;cience of not wor&s;hipping with them, becau&s;e in your opinion it is idolizing <HI>a man,</HI> who is as much a creature of God as a piece of bread, and ju&s;t as impro|per an object of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the great offence to Jews, Mahometans, and the world at large, being the doctrine of the <HI>trinity,</HI> it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ocieties of chri&s;tians &s;hould be formed expre&s;sly on this principle of the <HI>divine unity,</HI> that it may be evident to all the world, that there are chri&s;tians, and &s;ocieties of chri&s;tians, who hold the doctrine of the trinity in as much abhorrence as they them&s;elves can do. For the conver&s;ion of Jews or Mahometans to chri&s;tianity, while it is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the doctrine of the trinity, no per&s;on who knows, or has heard of Jews or Mahome|tans, can ever expect.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay We unitarians are but few, even in large towns, and &s;till fewer in villages, and there are no men of lei&s;ure or learning among us. But was not this the ca&s;e with the primitive chri&s;tians, and yet this circum&s;tance was no ob&s;truction to the forming of a chri&s;tian church in any place. We read of churches in private hou&s;es.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;emble together, therefore, in the name and in the fear of God, and according to the order of the go&s;pel, every Lord's-day, if there be no more that <HI>two or three,</HI> or even a &s;ingle family of you in a place; read the &s;criptures, and pray together. Al&s;o read &s;ermons, or other works of moral in&s;truction, of which there is, happily, no want at this day. Baptize, and admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper among your&s;elves; and as you grow more numer|ous, form your&s;elves upon &s;ome regular plan of church di&s;cipline; that it may be the means af uniting and keeping you together; and rigorou&s;ly exclude all per&s;ons who&s;e conduct would be a reproach to you.</P>
<P>As to a <HI>learned mini&s;try,</HI> it is acknowledged to be de&s;irable, where it can be had, but it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary. The grave&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons among you, and tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t lei&s;ure, will, in the character of <HI>elders,</HI> &s;elect and read proper prayers and di&s;cour&s;es, and perform all the of|fices of chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, ju&s;t as well as the elders in the primi|tive churches, who had no &s;uch helps as you now have; and miraculous powers were not of long continuance with them.</P>
<P>If you be at pre&s;ent members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, you
<PB N="33" REF="018741_0032_0FA81B8D7655F538">
will find <HI>a reformed liturgy</HI> ready prepared for your u&s;e by Mr. Lind&s;ey. But if you &s;hould prefer the mode of wor&s;hip among the Di&s;&s;enters (but men of &s;en&s;e will not make much account of &s;uch di&s;tinctions) you may in many authors, e&s;pecially at the end of Mr. Holland's &s;ermons, find forms of &s;uch prayers as you have been u&s;ed to: or you may apply to di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of your acquaintance, who will chearfully give you any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are trifling ob&s;tacles to a great de&s;ign. It requires in|deed a proper degree of chr&s;tiain <HI>zeal;</HI> but the object is worthy of it. The example has been already &s;et in Scotland, where it was lea&s;t of all to be expected; and the &s;ucce&s;s has been &s;uch as &s;hould abundantly encourage &s;imilar attempts in this country.</P>
<P>The Bapti&s;ts and Methodi&s;ts, not laying much &s;tre&s;s upon a learned mini&s;try, flouri&s;h greatly, the Independents are now taking the &s;ame methods, and with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s; while the rational Di&s;&s;enters, fancying they would be di&s;graced by the want of a learned mini&s;try, are dwindling away almo&s;t every where.</P>
<P>Whatever inconvenience may ari&s;e from mere <HI>novelty,</HI> it is &s;oon over; and as the Methodi&s;ts are collecting into bodies in all places; a thing of this kind will excite much le&s;s &s;urprize. But what impre&s;&s;ion ought the cen&s;ure of the world to make upon tho&s;e who, as chri&s;tians, profe&s;s to be <HI>above the world,</HI> and to <HI>rejoice that they are counted worthy to &s;uffer &s;hame</HI> in the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and to think them&s;elves <HI>happy</HI> if they be <HI>reproached</HI> on that account. You &s;hould imagine that you hear that awful <HI>voice from heaven,</HI> recorded in the book of Revelation, ch. xviii. 24. <HI>Come out of her</HI> (i. e. of my&s;tical Babylon, the great &s;ource of all the corruptions of chri&s;tianity) <HI>my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P>Be careful, however, to do this in the &s;pirit of chri&s;tian charity, which &s;hould be extended to all men, but e&s;pecially to all that bear the chri&s;tian name. Con&s;ider them as men who are in an error, which is always involuntary. Endeavour to remove the prejudices they unhappily lie under, but forbear all angry reproaches, all in&s;ult, and even ridicule; for religion is a &s;erious thing, and <HI>brotherly love</HI> is the very e&s;&s;ence of it. And if this love is to be extended even to <HI>enemies,</HI> much more &s;hould it be indulged towards our merely <HI>mi&s;taken friends.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this addre&s;s intirely approves of <HI>Mr. Lind&s;ey's Liturgy,</HI> or that which was u&s;ed at the Octagon Chapel in Liverpool; and he would recommend <HI>re&s;pon&s;es</HI> e&s;pecially to &s;ocieties formed in this manner, in which it is particularly de&s;ir|able, that the members, bring nearly on a level, &s;hould each bear his part in the &s;ervice. But le&s;t &s;ome, from the force of habit, &s;hould not be able to reconcile them&s;elves to the u&s;e of a liturgy, and object to the &s;cheme on that account, he intends, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould appear to be wanted, to draw up, or complie and publi&s;h, a &s;et of <HI>Forms for all the occa&s;ions of a chri&s;tian &s;ociety.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE TRIAL OF MR. E. ELWALL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS trial is printed from the author's &s;econd edition, even without altering &s;uch phra&s;es as are peculiar to that deno|mination of chri&s;tians with whom he generally a&s;&s;ociated, and who&s;e &s;tyle he adopted; and certainly the Quakers ought to think them&s;elves honoured even by this kind of relation to Mr. Elwall. Such firmne&s;s in the cau&s;e of truth, and &s;uch pre&s;ence of mind in a&s;&s;erting and vindicating it, as appear in this trial, are truly apo&s;tolical, and have had but few examples &s;ince the fir&s;t pro|mulgation of chri&s;tianity. It is impo&s;&s;ible for an unprejudiced per&s;on to read this account of it (which is written with &s;o much true &s;implicity, per&s;picuity, and &s;trength of evidence) without feel|ing the greate&s;t veneration for the writer, the fulle&s;t conviction and love of the truth, and a proportionable zeal in maintaining it. I &s;hould even think it impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t prejudiced per&s;on to read it attentively, but, if he u&s;e no violence with his own mind, he will receive &s;ome favourable impre&s;&s;ions both of the author, and of that cau&s;e, which he &s;upports with &s;uch becoming dignity, and with a temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, in every re&s;pect worthy of a true chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>So great was the force of truth on this memorable occa&s;ion, that a reputable and hone&s;t Jury, directed by a good-natured and &s;en&s;ible judge, acquitted the criminal contrary to the expre&s;s laws of this country, according to which this glorious man ought to have been &s;entenced to a &s;evere puni&s;hment, as a convicted and avowed <HI>bla&s;phemer.</HI> What mu&s;t a lover of <HI>truth,</HI> and of <HI>free inquiry,</HI> as &s;ub&s;ervient to truth, think of &s;uch laws, and of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of the countries in which they are in force!</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch a monument of the TRIUMPH OF TRUTH might be con&s;tantly held out to the view of all mankind, and particularly in this country where it was exibited.</P>
<P>The Dedication of the treati&s;e, on account of which Mr. Elwall was pro&s;ecuted, is dated <HI>the eighth day of the &s;econd month,</HI> 1724; he &s;peaks of his trial in a treati&s;e intitled, <HI>A declaration again&s;t all kings and temporal powers under heaven,</HI> printed in 1732; and Judge Denton, before whom he was tried, went the Oxford circuit in 1726 and 1728. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it may be concluded, that the former of the&s;e years is the date of this remarkable trial, e&s;pecially as in &s;ome part of the &s;ame year 1726. Mr. Elwall publi&s;hed another defence of the unitarian &s;y&s;tem, in a treati&s;e which he intitled <HI>Dagon fallen before the Ark of God,</HI> which would probably have been mentioned in the cour&s;e of the trial, if it had been publi&s;hed at that time.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH; BEING AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF MR. ELWALL. for HERESY and BLASPHEMY, at STAFFORD ASSIZES.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE &s;o many per&s;ons have earne&s;tly de&s;ired to read this trial, I have here publi&s;hed a &s;econd edition of it, in order to encourage all hone&s;t men, who have the eternal law of God on their &s;ide, not to fear the faces of prie&s;ts, who are gene|rally the grand adver&s;aries of liberty and truth; and the ba&s;tions and bulwarks of all ceremonies, &s;opperies, and ab&s;urd doctrines that are in the world.</P>
<P>I do this for the glory of the Mo&s;t High God, and for the ho|nour of his &s;acred law, and for the good of all my fellow creatures; that they may obey God, and not man; Chri&s;t, and not the pope; the prophets and apo&s;tles, and not prelates and prie&s;ts; and God knoweth this is my &s;incere de&s;ire, that all religion and &s;piri|tual things may be perfectly free, neither forced nor hindered; this being the true liberty of the go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>The kings of the Gentiles exerci&s;e authority, but it &s;hall not be &s;o with you.</HI></P>
<P>About fourteen years ago, I wrote a book intitled,
<Q>A True Te&s;timony for God and his &s;acred Law; being a plain, hone&s;t defence of the fir&s;t commandment of God, again&s;t all the Tri|nitarians under heaven, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HI></Q>
I lived then at <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> where my ance&s;t|ors have lived above eleven hundred years, ever &s;ince the <HI>Saxons</HI> conquered the <HI>Britons.</HI></P>
<P>When this book was publi&s;hed, the prie&s;ts in the country began to rage, e&s;pecially the prie&s;ts of <HI>Wolverhampton;</HI> who had a great hand in the &s;everal troubles I underwent, In &s;hort, they never cea&s;ed till they had procured a large indictment again&s;t me at <HI>Stafford</HI> a&s;&s;izes; where I felt the power of God, enabling me to &s;peak before a very great number of people; being accu&s;ed of here&s;y, &amp;c. But I truly an&s;wered as my beloved brother <HI>Paul</HI> did in his day, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>In that way which &s;ome call here&s;y, &s;o chu&s;e I to &s;erve the God of my fathers, believing all that is written in the law and the prophets.</Q></P>
<P>After the long indictment was read, I was a&s;ked if I pleaded guilty, or not guilty. I &s;aid I was not guilty of any evil, that I knew of, in writing that book; but if they meant whether I wrote the book or not (for they had quoted many pages of the
<PB N="36" REF="018741_0035_0FA81B9054859DC8">
book in that indictment) I owned I did write it; and that if I might have liberty to &s;peak, I believed I &s;hould make it manife&s;t to be the plain truth of God.</P>
<P>Then the judge &s;tood up and &s;aid,
<Q>Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you have had a copy of your indictment?</Q>
I told him I had not had any copy of it. Upon which he turned towards the prie&s;ts, and told them that I ought to have had a copy of it. But they not an&s;wering, he turned to me, and &s;aid, That if I would give bail, and be bound to appear at the next a&s;&s;izes, he would defer my trial till then. But I told him, I would not give bail, neither &s;hould any man be bound for me; that if the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> him&s;elf would, he &s;hould not; for, &s;aid I, I have an inno|cent brea&s;t, and I have injured no man; and therefore I de&s;ire no other favour, but that I may have liberty to plead to the indictment my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon which he &s;aid, very courteou&s;ly, You may. The judge having given me liberty of pleading to the indictment, I began my &s;peech with the &s;acred fir&s;t commandment of God, viz. <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods but Me.</HI> I in&s;i&s;ted upon the word <HI>Me</HI> being a &s;ingular; and that it was plain and certain, that God &s;pake of him&s;elf, as one &s;ingle per&s;on or being, and not three di&s;tinct per&s;ons. And that it was manife&s;t, that all the church of God, which then heard tho&s;e words, under&s;tood it in the &s;ame plain obvious &s;en&s;e as I do; as is mo&s;t evident from the words of the prophet <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> who &s;aid to I&s;rael thus;
<Q>Unto thee it was &s;hewed, that thou mighte&s;t know, that the Lord he is God, there is none el&s;e be&s;ides him; out of heaven he made thee hear his voice, &amp;c.</Q>
I told them, that from the words <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>his,</HI> it was certain God was but one &s;ingle per&s;on, one &s;ingle <HI>he,</HI> or <HI>him,</HI> or <HI>his.</HI> I told them, that all the patriarchs from the beginning of the world, did always addre&s;s them&s;elves to God, as one &s;ingle being. <HI>O</HI> thou <HI>Mo&s;t High God, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth;</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aid to the king of <HI>Sodom, I have lift up my hand unto the Lord, the Mo&s;t High God, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth, &amp;c.</HI> They knew nothing of a trinity, nor of God's being a plurality of per&s;ons; that mon&s;trous doctrine was not then born, nor for two thou&s;and years after, till the apo&s;|tacy and Popery began to put up its filthy head.</P>
<P>Then I told them, that all the prophets witne&s;&s;ed to the truth of the &s;ame pure uncorrupted unitarian doctrine <HI>of one God, and no other but he: Have we not all one Father, hath not one God crea|ted us?</HI> Then I told them the word of God to <HI>Abraham, I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect;</HI> and by the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah, To whom will ye <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> me, or &s;hall I be equal, &s;aith the holy One,</HI> not the holy Three. I told them that the words <HI>Me</HI> and <HI>One</HI> did utterly exclude any other per&s;on's being God, but that <HI>One</HI> &s;ingle <HI>Me;</HI> and that God him&s;elf often te&s;ti|fies the &s;ame truth, by &s;aying, <HI>Is there any God be&s;ides Me?</HI> And then tells us plainly, <HI>There is no God, I know not any: I am
<PB N="37" REF="018741_0036_0FA81B911B8D44B8">
the Lord, and there is none el&s;e: there is no God be&s;ides me.</HI> I&s;aiah xlv. 5.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid I, let God be true, but every man a liar, that is, every man that contradicteth him; for he is the God of truth; he &s;ays, <HI>I lift up my hand to heaven, I &s;ay, I live for ever.</HI></P>
<P>After I had pleaded many texts in the Old Te&s;tament, I began to enter the New: and told them, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the prophet, like unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> held forth the &s;ame doctrine that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had done; for when a certain ruler came to a&s;k him which was the fir&s;t and great commandment (or how he expounded it) he told him the &s;ame words that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had &s;aid. <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord thy God is one Lord,</HI> not three, <HI>and thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. and the &s;cribe &s;aid, <HI>Thou ha&s;t an&s;wered right for there is but one God, and there is no other but he,</HI> &amp;c. Then I mentioned the words of Chri&s;t, in the xviith of <HI>John</HI> and ver. 3. as very remarkable and worthy of all their ob&s;erva|tion: <HI>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> And then I turned my face directly to the prie&s;ts (my pro&s;ecutors, who all &s;tood on the right &s;ide of the judge) Now &s;aid I, &s;ince the lips of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, which always &s;poke the truth, &s;ays, his Father is the only true God; who is he, and who are they that dare &s;et up another, in contra|diction to my ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who &s;ays, his Father is <HI>the only true God?</HI></P>
<P>And I &s;topped here, to &s;ee if any of them would an&s;wer; but the power of God came over them, &s;o that all their mouths were &s;hut up, and not one of them &s;pake a word. So that I turned about over my left &s;houlder, and warned the people in the fear of God, not to take their religious &s;entiments from men, but from God; not from the Pope, but from Chri&s;t; not from Prelates nor Prie&s;ts, but from the Prophets and Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>And then I turned towards the judge and told him, that I was the more convinced of the truth of what I had &s;aid, from the words of my be&s;&s;ed Lord; who &s;aid, <HI>Call no man Father here upon earth; for one is your Father, even God, And call no man Ma&s;ter, for one is your Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</HI> From hence, &s;aid I, I deduce this natural inference, that in all things that are of a &s;piritual nature, we ought to take our religion from God and his prophets, from Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. It will be too long to mention all the texts and proofs that I made u&s;e of; I will only add one or two, as that of <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. viii. 4, 5, 6. where the apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>There is no other God but one; for though there be that are called gods (as there be gods many, and lords many) both in heaven and earth; but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things:</HI> &s;o that I told them here was a plain demon|&s;tration; for he &s;ays, <HI>there is but one God;</HI> and tells us who that one God is, that is, <HI>the Father.</HI> And therefore no other per&s;on could be God but the Father only; and what I had wrote in my book was the plain truth, and founded on God's own words, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018741_0037_0FA81B91D9663E38">In &s;hort, I could plainly perceive there was a general convince|ment through the court. The judge and ju&s;tices of the peace did not like the pro&s;ecution; but &s;aw plainly, that <HI>out of envy the prie&s;ts had done it.</HI> I then began to &s;et before them the odious nature of that hell-born principle of per&s;ecution, and that it was hatched in hell; that it never came from Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that he and his followers were often per&s;ecuted them&s;elves, but they never per&s;ecuted any; that we had now a very flagrant in&s;tance of it by the papi&s;ts at <HI>Thorn;</HI> where they fir&s;t took away the &s;chools where our brethren the prote&s;tants educated their children; then they took away the places of their religious wor&s;hip; then they put them in pri&s;ons; then confi&s;cated their e&s;tates, and, la&s;t of all, took away their lives.</P>
<P>Now we can cry out loud enough again&s;t this, and &s;how the inhumanity, cruelty, and barbarity of it; but, &s;aid I, if we, who call our&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;hall be found acting in the &s;ame &s;pirit, again&s;t others, the crime will be greater in us than in them becau&s;e we have attained to greater degrees of light than they.</P>
<P>However, I told them, that I had put my hou&s;e in order and made up my accounts with all men as near as I could: and that as I owed no man here any thing, &s;o I would not pay a penny towards this pro&s;ecution, And that I was &s;ure of it, that whatever fine they laid on me, or whatever hole or pri&s;on, &s;aid I, you thru&s;t me into, I &s;hall find God's living pre&s;ence with me, as I feel it this day: And &s;o ended my &s;peech.</P>
<P>Upon this a ju&s;tice of the peace, one <HI>Rupert Humpatch,</HI> got up, went to the judge, laid his hand upon the judge's &s;houlder, and &s;aid, My Lord, I know this man to be an hone&s;t man; and what I &s;ay, I &s;peak not by by hear &s;ay, but experience; for I was his next door neighbour three years. Al&s;o another ju&s;tice &s;poke to the &s;ame effect. Then the judge &s;poke to me: Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I perceive you have &s;tudied very deeply into this controver&s;y; but have you ever con&s;ulted any of our reverend clergy, and bi&s;hops of the church of <HI>England,</HI> I an&s;wered Yes, I have; and among others the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> him&s;elf, with whom I have exchanged ten letters, viz. four I have had from him, and &s;ix he has had from me. [At which words, all the prie&s;ts &s;tared very earne&s;tly.] Well, &s;ays the judge, and was not the archbi&s;hop able to give you &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the&s;e points, Mr. <HI>Elwall?</HI> I &s;aid, no; but rather quite the rever&s;e; for that in all the letters I &s;ent to the archbi&s;hop, I grounded my argu|ments upon the word of God and his prophets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; but in his an&s;wers to me, he referred me to acts of parlia|ment, and declarations of &s;tate, &amp;c. whereas I told the bi&s;hop, in one of my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that I wondered a man of his natural and acquired abilities, &s;hould be &s;o weak as to turn me over to human authorities, in things of a divine nature; for though in all things that are of a temporal nature, and concern the civil &s;ociety, <HI>I will be &s;ubject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<PB N="39" REF="018741_0038_0FA81B92A4616290">
&s;ake;</HI> even from the king upon the throne, down to the meane&s;t officer in the land; but in things that are of a &s;piritual nature, and concern my faith; my wor&s;hip of God, and future &s;tate, I would <HI>call no man father here upon earth,</HI> nor regard either popes or councils, prelates or prie&s;ts of any denomination, nor convo|cations, nor a&s;&s;emblies of divines: but obey God and his pro|phets, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. Upon which the judge an&s;wered, Well, if his Grace of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was not able to give you &s;atis|faction Mr <HI>Elwall,</HI> I believe I &s;hall not: and &s;o &s;at down and and re&s;ted him, for I think he had &s;tood up for near an hour and a quarter.</P>
<P>Then he &s;tood up again, and turning to the prie&s;ts, talked &s;oftly to them. I did not hear what he &s;aid, or what they &s;aid to him; but I gue&s;&s;ed from what the judge &s;aid next, for, &s;ays he, Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> you cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that what you have writ, being contrary to the commonly received doctrines of the church, it has given offence to &s;ome of your neighbours, and particularly to the clergy; are you willing to promi&s;e, before the face of the country here, that you will not write any more on this head? I an&s;wered, God forbid that I &s;hould make thee any &s;uch promi&s;e; for when I wrote this book, I did it in the fear of God; and I did not write it to plea&s;e the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor the church of <HI>England,</HI> nor the church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but to plea&s;e that God who gave me my breath; and therefore, if at any time I find my&s;elf drawn forth to write in defence of this &s;acred fir&s;t commandment, or any other of the ten, I hope I &s;hall do it in the &s;ame &s;pirit of &s;incerity as I have done this. And I perceived the judge was not in any wi&s;e di&s;plea&s;ed at my hone&s;t, plain, bold an&s;wer, but rather his heart &s;eemed to be knit in love to me; and he &s;oon declared me acquitted: and then the clerk of the arrraigns, or a&s;&s;izes, &s;tood up, and &s;aid, Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> you are acquitted: you may go out of court when you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>So I went away through a very great croud of people (for it was thought there was a thou&s;and people at the trial) and having &s;poken long I was a-thir&s;t, &s;o went to a well and drank. Then went out of town by a river-&s;ide, and looking about and &s;eeing no one near, I kneeled down on the bank of the river and &s;ent up my thank offering to that good God who had delivered me out of their hands.</P>
<P>By the time that I returned to the town, the court was up and gone to dinner: a ju&s;tice of peace and another per&s;on met me, and would have me to eat and drink with them, which I did: and after|wards as I was walking along the &s;treet, &s;ome per&s;ons hove up a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">-window and invited me up to them, and when I entered the room, I found ten or a dozen per&s;ons, mo&s;t of them ju&s;tices of the peace, and among&s;t them a prie&s;t, whom they called Doctor. One of the ju&s;tices took me by the hand, and &s;aid Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I am heartily glad to &s;ee you, and I was glad to hear you bear your te&s;timony &s;o boldly as you did. Yes, &s;ays another ju&s;tice, and I was glad <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> came off with flying colours as he did:</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="018741_0039_0FA81B9355C51308">Upon which the Prie&s;t &s;aid (in a very bitter manner) <HI>He ought to have been hanged.</HI> I turned unto him, and &s;aid Friend, I per|ceive <HI>thou do&s;t not know what &s;pirit thou art of; for the &s;on of man came not to de&s;troy but to &s;ave,</HI> But thou woulde&s;t have me de&s;troyed. Upon which one of the ju&s;tices &s;aid, How, now Doctor, did not you hear one of the ju&s;tices &s;ay, that he was an hone&s;t man, and that what he &s;aid, was not by hear-&s;ay, but by experience, and would you have hone&s;t men hanged. Doctor? Is this good doctrine? So that the prie&s;t &s;aid but little more for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>So I took leave of the ju&s;tices, and took hor&s;e for <HI>Wolverhamp|ton,</HI> for I knew there would be great joy in my family, for the common people all expected to hear of my being fined and impri|&s;oned. But a farmer that lived near, who had been upon the jury at <HI>Stafford</HI> got to town before me, and the people went all up and a&s;ked him. What have they done to Mr. <HI>Elwall?</HI> Have they put him in pri&s;on? He an&s;wered
<Q>No, he preached there an hour together, and our par&s;ons could &s;ay never a word. What mu&s;t they put him in pri&s;on for? I told our foreman of the jury. Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> was an hone&s;t man, and his father was an hone&s;t man, I knew him very well</Q>
&s;o they were all damped. But there was great joy in my family, and among&s;t all my friends: Prai&s;es, living prai&s;es be attributed to that good God who deliver|ed me out of their hands!</P>
<P>Chri&s;t never told us of that &s;candalous popi&s;h invention, of his human nature praying to his divine nature: but, like a true obedient &s;on of God, &s;ubmitted to death, even that cruel death which the hatred and envy of per&s;ecuting wicked prie&s;ts inflicted on him, becau&s;e he had &s;o plainly and truly told them all of their blindne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride, and hypocri&s;y. And therefore <HI>God rai&s;ed him from the dead;</HI> and for his faithfulne&s;s, <HI>God has exalted him to be a prince and a &s;aviour</HI> to all tho&s;e that obey that pure doctrine which God gave him to teach; <HI>that denying ungod|line&s;s and &s;inful lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly in this world Then are we his di&s;ciples indeed, when we do tho&s;e things that he hath commanded.</HI> Then &s;hall we be &s;aved, not by the merits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that is another popi&s;h invention; for he never did any thing but what was his duty to do, and therefore could not merit any thing for others: but he taught us the true way to find acceptance with God, and that was by "doing the will of his Father which is in heaven: and therein he is the way, the truth, and the life, "becau&s;e no one cometh unto the Father, but by that way.</P>
<P>Neither did he make &s;atisfaction unto God for us. It was im|po&s;&s;ible: and what God never required: But
<Q>he who had no plea&s;ure in the death of &s;inners, but rather that they &s;hould turn from wickedne&s;s and live,</Q>
out of the immea&s;ureable height and depth of his love, directed our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to teach man|kind a never failing way of being reconciled to God, and that was by &s;incere repentance and reformation. This was the go&s;pel
<PB N="41" REF="018741_0040_0FA81B9415876210">
or good tidings of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</HI> He tells us, <HI>I am not come to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance;</HI> and by that beautiful excellent parable of the prodigal &s;on, he illu&s;trates the tender mercy of his God, and our God, of his Father and our Father, without any &s;atisfaction. The compa&s;&s;ionate Father required none at all, but humble con|fe&s;&s;ion and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with &s;incere repentance, and reformation, and then comes <HI>the be&s;t robe, the ring, the &s;hoes, and the fatted calf,</HI> to demon&s;trate the paternal acceptance without &s;atisfaction or &s;acrifice, <HI>but a broken and a contrite heart which he will never re|fu&s;e;</HI> for he can as &s;oon cea&s;e to be God, as cea&s;e to be merciful.</P>
<P>And as to the trinitarians, nothing is more plain, than that they feed upon a&s;hes: <HI>a deceived heart hath turned them a&s;ide,</HI> becau&s;e they will not make u&s;e of tho&s;e rational faculties which God hath given them; nor &s;ay, <HI>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</HI> other|wi&s;e they would never flatter the humble <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> nor make the mo&s;t high God to be a plurality of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>For as to the Holy Gho&s;t (their third God) it is evidently no di&s;tinct per&s;on from God, any more than a man's &s;pirit is a di&s;|tinct per&s;on from the man; &s;o that the Spirit of God is God's &s;pirit; as is manife&s;t from &s;cripture and rea&s;on, Gen. vi. 3.
<Q>My &s;pirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man: And the &s;pirit of God moved upon the face of the waters: And God &s;aid, Let there be light, and there was light. And God &s;aid, Let there be a firmament in the mid&s;t of the waters And God made all things by the word of his power.</Q>
So that the word of God, and the &s;pirit of God, are not di&s;tinct per&s;ons from God, but the power of God, and the energy of God. So the word of a man, and the &s;pirit of a man, are not di&s;tinct per&s;ons from the man, but the man him&s;elf; if his word be fal&s;e, or his &s;pirit be wicked, the man is fal&s;e and wicked.</P>
<P>The &s;ame degree of &s;tupidity that leads trinitarians to call the word of God, and the &s;pirit of God, di&s;tinct per&s;ons, would lead them to call the wi&s;dom of God, the goodne&s;s of God, the love of God, the peace of God, the power of God, and the mercy of God, di&s;tinct per&s;ons; and make God to be a trinity of trinities: for it is certain, God is expre&s;&s;ly called by all tho&s;e names.</P>
<P>But who&s;oever goes about to father this ab&s;urd and horrid doctrine of the trinity upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t, do egregiou&s;ly abu&s;e him; who told us plainly, <HI>his Father was greater than he; and that he could do nothing of him&s;elf,</HI> which is a demon&s;tration that he is not God: For we are &s;ure God is omnipotent, and can do all things of him&s;elf; being &s;elf-exi&s;tent and independent, the &s;upreme cre|ator of the univer&s;e; and in this it is, that the unitarians triumph as un&s;werable, believing in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who told us his Father was <HI>the only true God,</HI> John xvii. 3.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> By the&s;e la&s;t words of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> I my&s;elf was convinced many years ago.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Arguments from rea&s;on again&s;t the trinitarian hypothe&s;is.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the doctrine of the trinity could ever have been &s;ugge&s;ted by any thing in the cour&s;e of nature (though it has been imagined by &s;ome per&s;ons of a peculiarly fanciful turn, and previou&s;ly per&s;uaded of the truth of that doctrine) is not maintained by any per&s;ons to whom my writings can be at all u&s;e|ful. I &s;hall therefore only addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who believe the doctrine on the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being contained in the &s;criptures, at the &s;ame time maintaining, that, though it is <HI>above,</HI> it is not properly <HI>contrary</HI> to rea&s;on; and I hope to make it &s;ufficiently evident, either that they do not hold the doctrine, or that the doctrine of <HI>three divine per&s;ons con&s;tituting one God</HI> is &s;trictly &s;peaking an <HI>ab&s;urdity,</HI> or <HI>contradiction;</HI> and that it is therefore in|capable of any proof, even by miracles. With this view, I &s;hall recite in order all the di&s;tinct modifications of this doctrine, and &s;hew that, upon any of them, there is either no proper <HI>unity,</HI> in the divine nature, or no proper <HI>trinity.</HI></P>
<P>If, with Dr. Waterland, and others who are reckoned the &s;tricte&s;t Athana&s;ians (though their opinions were not known in the time of Athana&s;ius him&s;elf) it be &s;uppo&s;ed that there are three per&s;ons properly equal, and that no one of them has any &s;ort of &s;uperiority over the re&s;t, they are, to all intents and purpo&s;es, three di&s;tinct Gods. For if each of them, &s;eparately con&s;idered, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all divine perfections, &s;o that nothing is wanting to complete divinity, each of them mu&s;t be as properly <HI>a God</HI> as any being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the properties of man mu&s;t be a man; and therefore <HI>three per&s;ons</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the attributes of divinity mu&s;t be as properly <HI>three Gods</HI> as three per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all hu|man attributes mu&s;t be three men. The&s;e three per&s;ons, there|fore, mu&s;t be incapable of any &s;trict or numerical <HI>unity.</HI> It mu&s;t be univer&s;ally true, that <HI>three things</HI> to which the &s;ame definition applies can never make only <HI>one thing</HI> to which the &s;ame definition applies. And when by the words <HI>thing, being,</HI> or <HI>per&s;on</HI> we mean nothing more than, logically &s;peaking, the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> or <HI>&s;ub&s;tratum of properties</HI> or <HI>attributes,</HI> it is a matter of indifference which of them we make u&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="018741_0043_0FA81B967AF4A2D8">Each of the&s;e three per&s;ons may have other properties, but they mu&s;t be numerically <HI>three</HI> in that re&s;pect in which the &s;ame defi|nition applies to them. If, therefore, the three per&s;ons agree in this circum&s;tance, that they are each of them <HI>perfect God,</HI> though they may differ in other re&s;pects, and have peculiar relations to each other, and to us, they mu&s;t &s;till be <HI>three Gods;</HI> and to &s;ay that they are only <HI>one God</HI> is as much a contradiction, as to &s;ay that three men, though they differ from one another as much as three men can do, are not three men, but only one man.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, with the ante-nicene fathers, and with bi&s;hops P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;on and Bull among the modern Engli&s;h writers, that the Father is the fountain of deity, and that the &s;on is derived from him, whether nece&s;&s;arily or voluntarily, whether in time or from all eternity, they cannot be of the &s;ame <HI>rank;</HI> but the Father will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an original, a real, and proper &s;uperiority to the Son; who will be no more than an <HI>effect</HI> of the Father's exertion of his powers, which is, to all intents and purpo&s;es, making the Son to be a <HI>production,</HI> or <HI>creature</HI> of the Father; even though it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed with the antients that he was created out of the &s;ub&s;tance of the Father, and without taking any thing from him. Moreover, as upon this &s;cheme the Son was never capable of giving birth to another per&s;on like him&s;elf, he mu&s;t have been originally inferior in power to the Father, the &s;ource from which he him&s;elf &s;prung. On this &s;cheme, therefore, there is no proper <HI>equality</HI> between the&s;e divine per&s;ons; and the ante-nicene fathers did not pretend that there was, but di&s;tingui&s;hed the Father by the epithet of (<HI>autotheos) God of him&s;elf,</HI> and the Son by the inferior title of (<HI>theos ek theou God of God,</HI> or a derived God.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that there is but one intelligent &s;upreme mind, but that it exerts it&s;elf three different ways, and has three different modes of action, or operation (which was the opinion of Dr. Wallis, and that which was generally a&s;cribed to the antient Sa|bellians) with re&s;pect to one of which the &s;ame divine Being was called the Father, to another the Son, and another the Holy Spi|rit; there is no proper <HI>trinity,</HI> at all. For on the &s;ame principle one man bearing three different offices, or having three different relations or capacities, as tho&s;e of magi&s;trate, father, &s;on, &amp;c. would be three different men.</P>
<P>Some repre&s;ent them&s;elves as believing the doctrine of the trinity by a&s;&s;erting with Dr. Doddridge, that
<Q>God is &s;o united to the derived nature of Chri&s;t, and does &s;o dwell in it, that, by virtue of that <HI>union,</HI> Chri&s;t may be properly called God, and &s;uch regards become due to him, as are not due to any created nature, or mere creature, be it in it&s;elf ever &s;o excellent.</Q></P>
<P><HI>See his Lectures, propo&s;ition</HI> 128, p. 392.</P>
<P>What this <HI>union</HI> is, in con&s;equence of which any creature can be entitled to the attributes and honours of his creator, is not pretended to be explained; but as we cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any idea of an union between God and a creature, be&s;ides that of
<PB N="45" REF="018741_0044_0FA81B97B0B7D128">
God being pre&s;ent with that creature, and acting by him, which is the &s;ame thing that is a&s;&s;erted by the <HI>Arians</HI> or <HI>Socinians,</HI> tho&s;e nominal <HI>trinitarians</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily belong to one or other of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es This is &s;o evident, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible not to &s;uppo&s;e but that they mu&s;t have been much a&s;&s;i&s;ted at lea&s;t in deceiving them&s;elves into a belief that they were trinitarians, by the influence which a dread of the odium and other inconvenien|ces attending the Arian or Socinian doctrine had on their minds. The pre&s;ence of God the Father with any creature, whether it be called an union with him, or it be expre&s;&s;ed in any other manner whatever, can be nothing more than the <HI>deity of the Father</HI> in that creature; and whatever it be that God voluntarily imparts, he may withdraw again at plea&s;ure. And what kind of divinity mu&s;t that be, which is dependent upon the will of another?</P>
<P>Upon none of the modifications, therefore, which have been mentioned (and all others may be reduced to the&s;e) can the doc|trine of the trinity, or of three divine per&s;ons in one God be &s;up|ported. In mo&s;t of them the doctrine it&s;elf is lo&s;t, and where it remains, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Arguments from Rea&s;on again&s;t the Arian Hypothe&s;is.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arian doctrine, of the world having been made and governed not by the &s;upreme God him&s;elf, but by Chri&s;t, the &s;on of God, though no contradiction in it&s;elf, is upon &s;everal accounts highly improbable.</P>
<P>Our rea&s;oning from effects to cau&s;es, carries us no farther than to the immediate creator of the vi&s;ible univer&s;e. For if we can &s;uppo&s;e that being to have had a cau&s;e, or author, we may &s;up|po&s;e that his cau&s;e or author had a higher cau&s;e, and &s;o on <HI>ad in|finitum.</HI> According to the light of nature, therefore, the imme|diate cau&s;e or author of the vi&s;ible univer&s;e, is the &s;elf-exi&s;tent fir&s;t cau&s;e, and not any being acting under him, as his in&s;trument. However, the &s;cheme it&s;elf is not naturally impo&s;&s;ible; &s;ince a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power &s;ufficient to produce the vi&s;ible univer&s;e, which is a limited production, may be <HI>finite,</HI> and therefore may de|rive his power and his being from one who is &s;uperior to him. But though the Arian &s;cheme cannot be &s;aid to be in it&s;elf impo&s;&s;ible, it is on &s;everal accounts, extremely improbable <HI>a priori,</HI> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very &s;trong and clear evidence.</P>
<P>If this great derived being, the &s;uppo&s;ed maker and governor of the world, was united to a human body, he mu&s;t either have re|tained and have exerci&s;ed his extraordinary powers during this union, or have been dive&s;ted of them; and either &s;uppo&s;ition has its peculiar difficulties and improbabilites.</P>
<P>If this great being retained his proper powers during this uni|on, he mu&s;t have been &s;u&s;taining the whole univer&s;e, and &s;uperin|tending all the laws of nature, while he was in infant at the brea&s;t of his mother, and while he hung upon the cro&s;s. And to imagine the creator of the world to have been in tho&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="018741_0045_0FA81B97E0CA64D8">
circum&s;tances, is an idea at which the mind revolts, almo&s;t as much as at that of the &s;upreme God him&s;elf being reduced to them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if Chri&s;t retained and exerci&s;ed all his former powers in this &s;tate of apparent humiliation, he mu&s;t have wrought all his miracles by a power properly <HI>his own,</HI> a power naturally <HI>belong|ing to him,</HI> as much as the power of &s;peaking and walking belongs to any other man. But this is expres&s;ly di&s;claimed by our &s;avi|our, when he &s;aid, that <HI>of him&s;elf he could do nothing,</HI> and that it was the <HI>Father within him who did the works.</HI> Al&s;o, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, it mu&s;t have been this &s;uper-angelic being united to the body of Je&s;us, that rai&s;ed him from the dead; whereas this is an effect which is always a&s;cribed to God the Father only.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, Chri&s;t was dive&s;ted of his original powers, or <HI>emptied him&s;elf</HI> of them upon his incarnation, the whole &s;y&s;tem of the government of the univer&s;e mu&s;t have been changed during his re&s;idence upon earth. Either &s;ome other derived being (which this &s;cheme does not provide) mu&s;t have taken his place, or the &s;upreme being him&s;elf mu&s;t have conde&s;cended to do that which the &s;cheme &s;uppo&s;es there was an impropriety in his doing. For cer|tainly the making and the governing of the world would not have been delegated to another, if there had not been &s;ome good rea&s;on in the nature of things, though it be unknown to us and may be indi&s;coverable by us, why the world &s;hould have been made and governed by a derived being, and not by the &s;upreme being him&s;elf. And this rea&s;on, whatever it was, mu&s;t, as far as we can judge, have operated during the time that Chri&s;t was upon the earth, as well as before.</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t was degraded to the &s;tate of a mere man during his humiliation on earth, rea&s;on will a&s;k, why might not a mere man have been &s;ufficient? Since, notwith&s;tanding his original powers, nothing was, in fact, done by him, more than any other man, aided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by God as he was, might have been equal to.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the object of Chri&s;t's mi&s;&s;ion, and the beings whom it re&s;pected, viz. the <HI>race of man,</HI> we cannot but think that there mu&s;t have been a greater propriety, and u&s;e, in the appointment of a mere man to that office. What occa&s;ion was there for any being &s;uperior to man for the purpo&s;e of communicating the will of God to man? And as an example of a re&s;urrection to an im|mortal life (to enforce which was the great object of his mi&s;&s;ion the) death and re&s;urrection of one who was properly and &s;imply a man, was certainly far better adapted to give men &s;atisfaction concerning their own future re&s;urrection, than the &s;eeming death (for it could be nothing more) of &s;uch a being as the maker of the world, and the re&s;urrection of a body to which he had been united. For, as he was a being of &s;o much higher rank, it might be &s;aid, that the laws of his nature might be very different from tho&s;e of ours; and therefore he might have privileges to which we could not pretend, and to which we ought not to a&s;pire.</P>
<P>If the world was created and governed by a derived being, this
<PB N="47" REF="018741_0046_0FA81B98ADAE5DD0">
being, on whom we immediately depended, would be that to whom all men would naturally look. He would nece&s;&s;arily become the object of their prayers, in con&s;equence of which the &s;upreme being would be overlooked, and become a mere cypher in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As modern philo&s;ophy &s;uppo&s;es that there are innumerable worlds inhabited by rational and imperfect beings (for all <HI>creatures</HI> mu&s;t be finite and imperfect) be&s;ides this of ours, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but that many of them mu&s;t have &s;tood in as much need of the in|terpo&s;ition of the maker of the univer&s;e as we have done. And can we &s;uppo&s;e either that this &s;hould be the only &s;pot in the univer&s;e &s;o highly di&s;tingui&s;hed, or that the maker of it &s;hould undergo as many degradations as this &s;cheme may require?</P>
<P>The doctrine of Chri&s;t's pre-exi&s;tence goes upon the idea of the po&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, of the pre-exi&s;tence of other men, and &s;uppo&s;es an immaterial &s;oul in man, altogether independent of the body; &s;o that it mu&s;t have been capable of thinking and acting before his birth, as well as it will be after his death. But the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;itions which no appearance in nature favours.</P>
<P>The Arian hypothe&s;is, therefore, though it implies no proper contradiction, is on &s;everal accounts, highly improbable <HI>a priori,</HI> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very clear and &s;trong evidence.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> Arguments again&s;t the Trinitarian and the Arian hypothe&s;is from the &s;criptures.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now &s;hew, in as conci&s;e a manner as I can, that the doctrine of the trinity, and al&s;o the Arian hypothe&s;is, has as little countenance from the &s;criptures as it has from rea&s;on. The &s;criptures teach us that there is but one God, who is him&s;elf the maker and the governor of all things; that this one God is the &s;ole object of wor&s;hip, and that he &s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t to in&s;truct mankind, impowered him to work miracles, rai&s;ed him from the dead, and gave him all the power that he ever was, or is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;criptures contain the cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t expre&s;s de|clarations that there is but <HI>one God,</HI> without ever mentioning any exception in favour of <HI>a trinity,</HI> or guarding us again&s;t being led into any mi&s;take by &s;uch general and unlimited expre&s;&s;ions. Ex. xx. 3. "Thou &s;halt have no other God before me." Deut. vi. 4. "Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God, is one Lord." Mark xii. 20.
<Q>The fir&s;t of all the commandments is, Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord.</Q>

<P><PB N="48" REF="018741_0047_0FA81B9B9DFC50B8">On the other hand, not only does the word <HI>trinity</HI> never occur in the &s;criptures, but it is no where &s;aid that <HI>there are three per|&s;ons in this one God;</HI> nor is the doctrine explicitly laid down in any other direct propo&s;ition whatever. Chri&s;t indeed &s;ays, John x, 30. "I and my Father are one;" but he &s;ufficiently explains him&s;elf, by praying that his di&s;ciples might be one with him in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which he was one with the Father. John xvii. 21.22
<Q>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us; and the glory which thou gave&s;t to me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. This one God is &s;aid to have created all things; and no intimation is given of his having employed any <HI>inferior agent,</HI> or <HI>in&s;trument,</HI> in the work of creation. GEN. i. 1. <HI>In the begining God created the heaven and the earth.</HI>&mdash;v. <HI>God &s;aid let there be light, and there was light,</HI> Ps. xxxiii 6. <HI>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the ho&s;t of them by the breath of his mouth</HI>&mdash;v. ix. <HI>He &s;pake, and it was done, he com|manded, and it &s;tood fa&s;t.</HI> Is. xliv. 24. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that &s;tretched forth the heavens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the earth by my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This one God is called the <HI>Father,</HI> i. e. the author of all beings; and he is called God and Father with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, as well as all other per&s;ons.

<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t is &s;aid expre&s;lly to be inferior to the Father, all his power is &s;aid to have been given him by the Father, and he could do nothing without the Father. JOHN xiv. 28, <HI>My Father is greater than I.</HI> 1 COR. iii. 23, <HI>Ye are Chri&s;t's and Chri&s;t is God's.</HI> 1 COR. xi. 3, <HI>The head of Chri&s;t is God.</HI> JOHN v. 19, <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the Son can do nothing of him&s;elf.</HI> John xiv. 10, <HI>The words that I &s;peak unto you I &s;peak not of my&s;elf, but the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the works.</HI> Matt. xxviii. 18, <HI>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</HI> 2 Pet. i. 17, <HI>He received from God the Father honour and glory.</HI> Rev. i. 1, <HI>The revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which God gave unto him.</HI></P>
<P>It is now alledged, that Chri&s;t did not mean that he was inferi|or to the Father with re&s;pect to his <HI>divine nature,</HI> but only with re&s;pect to his <HI>human nature.</HI> But if &s;uch liberties be taken in ex|plaining a per&s;on's meaning, language has no u&s;e whatever. On
<PB N="49" REF="018741_0048_0FA81B9CABE28710">
the &s;ame principles, it might be a&s;&s;erted that Chri&s;t never died, or that he never ro&s;e from the dead, &s;ecretly meaning his divine nature only. There is no kind of impo&s;ition but what might be authorized by &s;uch an abu&s;e of language as this.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some things were with-held from Chri&s;t by his Father, Mark xiii. 32,
<Q>But of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man; no not the angels that are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Matt. xx. 23, To &s;it on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give; but it &s;hall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6 As all the dominion that Chri&s;t has was derived from the Fa|ther &s;o it is &s;ubordinate to that of the Father, 1 Cor. xv 24, &amp;c.
<Q>Then cometh the end, when he &s;hall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he &s;hall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power For he mu&s;t reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The la&s;t enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he &s;aith that all things are put under him, it is manife&s;t that he is excepted who did put all things under him. And when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued to him, then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. Chri&s;t always prayed to the Father, and with as much humi|lity and re&s;ignation, as any man, or the mo&s;t dependent being in the univer&s;e, could po&s;&s;ibly do. Our Lord's whole hi&s;tory is a proof of this; but e&s;pecially the &s;cene of his agony in the garden, Matt. xxvi. 37, &amp;c.
<Q>And he began to be &s;orry and very heavy; Then &s;aith he unto them, my &s;oul is exceeding &s;orrow|ful even unto death, tarry ye here and watch with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, &s;aying, O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this cup pa&s;s from me; neverthele&s;s, not as I will, but as thou will.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. Chri&s;t is not only &s;tiled <HI>a man</HI> even after his re&s;urrection, but the rea&s;oning of the apo&s;tles, in &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages where he is &s;poken of, require that he &s;hould be con&s;idered as a man with re&s;pect to <HI>his nature,</HI> and not in <HI>name</HI> only, as their rea&s;oning has no force but upon that &s;uppo&s;ition. ACTS ii. 22,
<Q>Je&s;us of Nazareth, a man approved of by God, by miracles and wonders, and &s;igns, which God did by him, in the mid&s;t of you</Q>
HEB. ii. 17, "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren. HEB. ii. 10,
<Q>It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many &s;ons unto glory, to make the captain of their &s;alvation perfect through &s;uffering,</Q>
1. COR xv, 21.
<Q>For &s;ince by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection from the dead. For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9 Whatever exaltation Chri&s;t now enjoys, it is the gift of his Father, and the reward of his obedience unto death. PHIL. ii. 8, 9,
<Q>And being in fa&s;hion as a man, he humbled him&s;elf, and
<PB N="50" REF="018741_0049_0FA81B9D1BE386C0">
became obedient to death, even the death of the cro&s;s. Where|fore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name,</Q>
HEB ii. 9
<Q>But we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels for the &s;uffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.</Q>
HEB. xii 2, Looking unto
<Q>Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith; who for the joy which was &s;et before him endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and &s;at down at the right hand of the throne of God.</Q></P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that no u&s;e whatever is made of the doctrine of the incarnation of the maker of the world, in all the New Te&s;tament. We are neither informed <HI>why</HI> &s;o extraordinary a mea&s;ure was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of men, nor that it <HI>was</HI> nece&s;&s;ary. All that can be pretended is, that it is <HI>alluded to</HI> in certain expre&s;&s;ions. But certainly it might have been expected that a mea&s;ure of this magnitude &s;hould have been expre&s;lly declared, if not clearly explained; that mankind might have no doubt what great things had been done for them; and that they might re&s;pect their great deliverer, as his nature, and his proper rank in the creation, required.</P>
<P>The author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews evidently con&s;idered Chri&s;t as a being of a different rank from that of angels; and the rea&s;on why he &s;ays that he ought to be &s;o, is, that he might have a feeling of our infirmities. But, certainly, we &s;hall be more ea&s;ily &s;atisfied that any per&s;on really <HI>felt</HI> as a man, if he was truly a man, and nothing more than a man; than if he was a &s;uperior being, and e&s;pecially a being &s;o far &s;uperior to us as the maker of the world mu&s;t have been, degraded to the condition of a man. Becau&s;e, if he had any recollection of his former &s;tate, the idea of that mu&s;t have borne him up under his difficulties and &s;ufferings, in &s;uch a manner as no mere man could have been &s;upported. And it is &s;uppo&s;ed by the Arians that Chri&s;t had a knowledge of his prior &s;tate, for they &s;uppo&s;e him to have referred to it in his prayer to the Father, for <HI>the glory which he had with him before the world was;</HI> and yet this is hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the account that Luke gives of his <HI>increa&s;ing in wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>No per&s;on, I think, can, with an unprejudiced mind, attend to the&s;e con&s;iderations, and the texts of &s;cripture above recited (which are perfectly agreeable to the tenor of the whole) and imagine that it was the intention of the &s;acred writers to repre&s;ent Chri&s;t either as the &s;upreme God, or as the maker of the world under God. There is another hypothe&s;is, of &s;ome modern Arians, which repre|&s;ents Chri&s;t as having pre-exi&s;ted; but not as having been the creator or governor of the world, or the medium of all the di&s;pen|&s;ations of God to mankind. But tho&s;e texts of &s;cripture which &s;eem to be mo&s;t expre&s;s in favour of Chri&s;t's pre-exi&s;tence; do likewi&s;e, by the &s;ame mode of interpretation, repre&s;ent him as the maker of the world; &s;o that if the favourers of this hypothe&s;is can &s;uppo&s;e the language of the&s;e texts to be figurative, they may more ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e the other to be figurative al&s;o; and that
<PB N="51" REF="018741_0050_0FA81B9DE5C4E648">
whatever ob&s;curity there may be in them, they were not intended to refer to any pre-exi&s;tence at all.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak of Chri&s;t, as the maker of the world, are the following, viz. JOHN i. 1, 10. EPH. iii. 9. COL. i. 15, &amp;c. HEB i. 1, &amp;c. The&s;e, I will venture to &s;ay, are the texts that mo&s;t &s;trongly favour the notion of Chri&s;t's pre-exi&s;tence, and no per&s;on can doubt but that, if they mu&s;t be interpreted to a&s;&s;ert that Chri&s;t pre-exi&s;ted at all, they, with the &s;ame clearne&s;s, a&s;&s;ert that he was the maker of the world. But if the&s;e texts admit of a figurative interpretation, all the other texts, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to the <HI>pre-exi&s;tence only</HI> will more ea&s;ily admit of a &s;imilar con&s;truction. The&s;e two opinions, therefore, viz. that Chri&s;t pre-exi&s;ted, and that he was the maker of the world, ought, by all means, to &s;tand or fall together; and if any per&s;on think the latter to be improbable, and contrary to the plain tenor of the &s;criptures (which uniformly repre&s;ent the &s;upreme being him&s;elf, without the aid of any inferior agent, or in&s;trument, as the maker of the univer&s;e) he &s;hould abandon the doctrine of &s;imple pre-exi&s;tence al&s;o.</P>
<P>In what manner the proper unitarians interpret the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, may be &s;een in my <HI>Familiar Illu&s;tration of particular texts of &s;cripture,</HI> in &s;everal of the <HI>Socinian tracts,</HI> in three volumes quarto, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Mr. Lind&s;ey's Sequel to his Apology,</HI> p. 455, to which I refer my reader for a farther dicu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is only of late years, that any per&s;ons have pretended to &s;eparate the two opinions of Chri&s;t's pre-exi&s;tence, and of his being the maker of the world. All the antient Arians maintained both, as did Dr. Clarke, Mr. Whi&s;ton, Mr. Emlyn, Mr Pierce, and their followers; and I do not know that any other hypothe&s;is, has appeared <HI>in writing,</HI> except that it is alluded to in the Theo|logical Repo&s;itory.</P>

<P N="1">1 IT is acknowledged by early writers of the orthodox per|&s;ua&s;ion, that two kinds of here&s;y exi&s;ted in the times of the apo&s;tles, viz. that of tho&s;e who held that Chri&s;t was &s;imply a man, and that of the Gno&s;tics; of whom &s;ome believed that Chri&s;t was man only in appearance, and others that it was only Je&s;us, and not the Chri&s;t (a pre-exi&s;tent &s;pirit who de&s;cended from heaven and dwelt in him) that &s;uffered on the cro&s;s. Now the apo&s;tle John animadverts with the greate&s;t &s;everity upon the latter, but makes makes no mention of the former; and can it be thought probable

that he would pa&s;s it without cen&s;ure, if he had thought it to be an error; con&s;idering how great, and how dangerous an error it has always been thought by tho&s;e who have con&s;idered it as being an error at all? Maxim 12. H. p. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great objection that Jews have always made to chri&s;ti|anity in its pre&s;ent &s;tate is, that it enjoins the wor&s;hip of more gods than one; and it is a great article with the chri&s;tian writers of the &s;econd and following centuries to an&s;wer this objection. But it does not appear in all the book of Acts, in which we hear much of the cavils of the Jews, both in Jeru&s;alem and in many parts of the Roman empire, that they made any &s;uch objection to chri&s;ti|anity then; nor do the apo&s;tles either there, or in their epi&s;tles, advance any thing with a view to &s;uch an objection. It may be pre&s;umed, therefore, that no &s;uch offence to the Jews had then been given, by the preaching of a doctrine &s;o offen&s;ive to them as that of the divinity of Chri&s;t mu&s;t have been. Maxim 12, 13. L. p 50</P>
<P N="3">3. As no Jew had originally any idea of their Me&s;&s;iah being more than a man, and as the apo&s;tles and the fir&s;t chri&s;tians had certainly the &s;ame idea at fir&s;t concerning Je&s;us, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that, if ever they had been informed that Je&s;us was not a man, but either God him&s;elf, or the maker of the world under God, we &s;hould have been able to trace the time and the circum&s;tances in which &s;o a great a di&s;covery was made to them; and al&s;o that we &s;hould have perceived the effect which it had upon their minds; at lea&s;t by &s;ome change in their manner of &s;peaking concern|ing him. But nothing of this kind is to be found in the go&s;pels, in the book of Acts, or in any of the Epi&s;tles. We perceive marks enow of other new views of things, e&s;pecially of the call of the Gentiles to partake of the privileges of the go&s;pel; and we hear much of the di&s;putes and the eager contention which it occa&s;ioned. But how much more mu&s;t all their prejudices have been &s;hocked by the information that a per&s;on whom they fir&s;t took to be <HI>a mere man,</HI> was not a man, but either God him&s;elf, or the maker of the world under God? Maxim 13. L. p. 55</P>
<P N="4">4. All the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians, after the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, which was immediately after the age of the apo&s;tles are, &s;aid to have been <HI>Ebionites;</HI> and the&s;e were only of two &s;orts, &s;ome of them holding the miraculous conception of our &s;aviour, and others believing that he was the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, as well as of Mary. None of them are &s;aid to have believed either that he was God, or the maker of the world under God. And is it at all credible that the body of the Jewi&s;h chri&s;tians, if they had ever been in&s;tructed by the apo&s;tles in the doctrine of the divinity, or pre-exi&s;tence of Chri&s;t, would &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o generally, if not univer&s;ally, have abandoned that faith?

But prayers to Je&s;us Chri&s;t were not u&s;ed in early times, but gained ground gradually, with the opinion of Chri&s;t being God, and the object of wor&s;hip. Maxim 14. L. p 81.</P>
<P N="6">6 Athana&s;ius repre&s;ents the apo&s;tles as obliged to u&s;e great caution not to offend their fir&s;t converts with the doctrine of Chri&s;t's divinity, and as forbearing to urge that topic till they were fir&s;t well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the belief of his being the Me&s;&s;iah. He adds, that the Jews being in an error on this &s;ub|ject, drew the Gentiles into it. Chry&s;o&s;tom agrees with Athana|&s;ius in this repre&s;entation of the &s;ilence of the apo&s;tles in their fir&s;t preaching, both with re&s;pect to the divinity of Chri&s;t, and his miraculous conception. They both repre&s;ent them as leaving their di&s;ciples to learn the doctrine of Chri&s;t's divinity, by way of <HI>inference</HI> from certain expre&s;&s;ions; and they do not pretend to produce any in&s;tance in which they taught that doctrine clearly and explicitly. Maxim 13. H. p. 12 L. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 53.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hege&s;ippus, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian hi&s;torian, him&s;elf a Jew, and therefore probably an Ebionite, enumerating the here&s;ies of his time, mentions &s;everal of the Gno&s;tic kind, but not that of Chri&s;t being a mere man. He moreover &s;ays, that in travelling to Rome, where he arrived in the time of A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">cetus, he found all the Churches that he vi&s;ited held the faith which had been taught by Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, which, in his opinion, was probably that of Chri&s;t being not God, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> only. Ju&s;tin Martyr al&s;o, and Clemens Alexandrinus, who wrote after He|ge&s;ippus, treat largely of here&s;ies in general, without mentioning, or alluding to the unitarians. Maxim 8 H p 8. R p 8.</P>
<P N="8">8. All tho&s;e who were deemed <HI>heretics</HI> in early times; were cut off from the communion of tho&s;e who called them&s;elves the <HI>orthodox</HI> chri&s;tians, and went by &s;ome particular name; generally that of their leader. But the unitarians among the Gentiles were not expelled from the a&s;&s;emblies of chri&s;tians, but wor&s;hip|ped along with tho&s;e who were called orthodox, and had no par|ticular name till the time of Victor, who excommunicated Theo|dorus; and a long time after that Epiphanius endeavoured to give them the name of Alogi. And though the Ebionites, pro|bably about or before this time, had been excommunicated by the Gentile Chri&s;tians, it was, as Jerom &s;ays <HI>only</HI> on account of their rigid adherence to the law of Mo&s;es. Maxim 5. H. p. 14. L. p. 25.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Apo&s;tles creed</HI> is that which was taught to all catechu|mens before bapti&s;m, and additions were made to it from time to time in order to exclude tho&s;e who were denominated <HI>heretics.</HI> Now, though there are &s;everal articles in that creed which allude to the Gno&s;tics and tacitly condemn them, there was not, in the time of Tertullian, any article in it that alluded to the unitari+ans
<PB N="54" REF="018741_0053_0FA81BA015775898">
&s;o that even then any unitarian, at lea&s;t one believing the miraculous conception, might have &s;ub&s;cribed it. It may, therefore, be concluded, that &s;imple unitariani&s;m was not deemed he|retical at the end of the &s;econd century. Maxim 7. L. p. 27.</P>
<P N="10">10 It is acknowledged by Eu&s;ebius and others, that the an|tient unitarians them&s;elves, con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted that their doctrine was the prevailing opinion of the chri&s;tian church till the time of Victor. Maxim 2 H. p. 18. R. p. 25.</P>
<P N="11">11. Ju&s;tin Martyr, who maintains the pre-exi&s;tence of Chri&s;t, is &s;o far from calling the contrary opinion a <HI>here&s;y,</HI> that what he &s;ays on the &s;ubject is evidently an apology for his own: and when he &s;peaks of <HI>heretics in general,</HI> which he does with great indignation, as no chri&s;tians, and having no communication with chri&s;tians, he mentions the Gno&s;tics only. Maxim 12. H. p. 17. R. p. 15. L. p. 127.</P>
<P N="12">12 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, who was after Ju&s;tin and who wrote a large treati&s;e on the &s;ubject of here&s;y, &s;ays very little concerning the Ebionites. Tho&s;e Ebionites he &s;peaks of as believing that Chri&s;t was the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, and he makes no mention of tho&s;e who believed the miraculous conception. Maxim. 12. H p. 15. L. p 32, 118.</P>
<P N="13">13. Tertullian repre&s;ents the majority of the common or unlearn|ed chri&s;tians, the <HI>Idiot<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> as unitarians; and it is among the com|mon people that we always find the olde&s;t opinions in any country, and in any &s;ect, while the learned are mo&s;t apt to innovate. It may therefore be pre&s;umed that, as the unitarian doctrine was held by the common people in the time of Tertullian, it had been more general &s;till before that time, and probably univer&s;al in the apo&s;tolical age. Athana&s;ius al&s;o mentions it as a &s;ubject of complaint to the orthodox of his age that <HI>the many,</HI> and e&s;|pecially, per&s;ons of <HI>low under&s;tandings,</HI> were inclined to the uni|tarian doctrine. Maxim 4, 10. R p 26 L. p. 49.</P>
<P N="14">14. The fir&s;t who held and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the doctrine of the pre-ex|i&s;tence and divinity of Chri&s;t, acknowledged that their opinions were exceedingly unpopular among the unlearned chri&s;tians; that the&s;e dreaded the doctrine of the trinity, thinking that it infring|ed upon the doctrine of the &s;upremacy of God the Father; and the learned chri&s;tians make frequent apologies to them, and to others, for their own opinion. Maxim 10. H. p. 54.</P>
<P N="15">15. The divinity of Chri&s;t was fir&s;t advanced and urged by tho&s;e who had been heathen philo&s;ophers, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were admirers of the doctrine of Plato, who held the opinion of a &s;econd God. Au&s;tin &s;ays, that he con&s;idered Chri&s;t as no other than a mo&s;t excellent man, and that he had no &s;u&s;picion of the word of God being incarnate in him, or how
<Q>the catholic faith differed from the error of Photinus.</Q>
(the la&s;t of the proper unitarians who&s;e name is come down to us) till he read the books of Plato; and that he was afterwards confirmed in the Catholic doctrine by reading the &s;criptures. Con&s;tantine in his oration to the fathers of the council of Nice, &s;peaks with com|mendation

of Plato, as having taught the doctrine of
<Q>a &s;econd God, derived from the &s;upreme God, and &s;ub&s;ervient to his will.</Q>
Maxim 11. H. p. 20,</P>
<P N="16">16. There is a pretty ea&s;y gradation in the progre&s;s of the doc|trine of the divinity of Chri&s;t; as he was fir&s;t thought to be a God in &s;ome qualified &s;en&s;e of the word, a di&s;tingui&s;hed emanation from the &s;upreme mind; and then the Logos or the wi&s;dom of God per&s;onified; and this <HI>logos</HI> was fir&s;t thought to be only occa&s;i|onally detached from the Deity, and then drawn into his e&s;&s;ence again, before it was imagined to have a <HI>permanent per&s;onality,</HI> di&s;tinct from that of the &s;ource from which it &s;prung. And it was not till 400 years after that time that Chri&s;t, was thought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the Father. Whereas, on the other hand, though it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that the apo&s;tles taught the doctrine of the divinity of Chri&s;t, yet it cannot be denied that in the very times of the apo&s;tles, the Jewi&s;h church, and many of the Gen|tiles al&s;o, held the opinion of his being a mere man. Here the tran&s;ition is quite &s;udden, without any gradation at all. This mu&s;t naturally have given the greate&s;t alarm, &s;uch as is now given to tho&s;e who are called orthodox, by the pre&s;ent Socinians; and yet nothing of this kind can be perceived Be&s;ides, it is certainly mo&s;t probable that the chri&s;tians of tho&s;e times, urged as they were with the meanne&s;s of their ma&s;ter, &s;hould incline to <HI>add to</HI> rather than <HI>take from,</HI> his natural rank and dignity.

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Maxims of Hi&s;torical Critici&s;m, by which the preceding articles may be tried.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN two per&s;ons give different accounts of things, that evidence is to be preferred, which is either in it&s;elf more probable, or more agreeable to other credible te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither is entire credit to be given to any &s;et of men with re&s;pect to what is reputable to them, nor to their enemies with re&s;pect to what is di&s;reputable; but the account given by the one may be balanced by that of the other. Summary View, No. 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Accounts of any &s;et of men given by their enemies only are always &s;u&s;picious. But the confe&s;&s;ions of enemies, and circum|&s;tances favourable to any body of men, collected from the wri|tings of their adver&s;aries, are de&s;erving of particular regard.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is more natural for men who wi&s;h to &s;peak di&s;paragingly of any &s;ect to undervalue their numbers, as well as every thing el&s;e relating to them; and it is equally natural for tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;peak re&s;pectfully of any party, to repre&s;ent the members of it as more numerous than they are. Summary View, No. 13.</P>
<P N="5">5. When per&s;ons form them&s;elves into &s;ocieties, &s;o as to be di|&s;tingui&s;hable from others, they never fail to get &s;ome <HI>particular name,</HI> either a&s;&s;umed by them&s;elves, or impo&s;ed by others. This is nece&s;&s;ary in order to make them the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, long paraphra&s;es in di&s;cour&s;e being very inconvenient. Summary View, No. 8.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="56" REF="018741_0055_0FA81BA1D40DF4F8">6. When particular opinions are a&s;cribed to a particular cla&s;s of men, without any di&s;tinction of the time when tho&s;e opinions were adopted by them, it may be pre&s;umed, that they were &s;up|po&s;ed to hold tho&s;e opinions from the time that they received their denomination. Summary View, No. 4</P>
<P N="7">7. When a particular de&s;cription is given of a cla&s;s of per&s;ons within any period of time, any per&s;on who can be proved to have had the proper character of one of that cla&s;s, may be deemed to have belonged to it, and to have enjoyed all the privileges of it, whatever they were. Summary View, No. 9.</P>
<P N="8">8. When an hi&s;torian, or writer of any kind, profe&s;&s;edly enu|merates the &s;everal <HI>&s;pecies</HI> belonging to any <HI>genus,</HI> or general body of men, and omits any particular &s;pecies or denomination, which, if it had belonged to the genus, he, from his &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, was not likely to have overlooked, it may be pre&s;umed that he did not con&s;ider that particular &s;pecies as be|longing to the genus. Summary View, No. 7.</P>
<P N="9">9. Great changes in opinion are not u&s;ually made of a &s;udden, and never by great bodies of men. That hi&s;tory, therefore, which repre&s;ents &s;uch changes as having been made gradually, and by ea&s;y &s;teps, is always the more probable on that account. Summary View, No. 16.</P>
<P N="10">10. The common or unlearned people, in any country, who do not &s;peculate much, retain longe&s;t any opinions with which their minds have been much impre&s;&s;ed; and therefore we always look for the olde&s;t opinions in any country, or any cla&s;s of men, among the common people, and not among the learned. Sum|mary View, No. 13, 14.</P>
<P N="11">11. If any new opinions be introduced into a &s;ociety, they are mo&s;t likely to have introduced them, who held opinions &s;imilar to them before they joined that &s;ociety. Summary View, No. 15.</P>
<P N="12">12. If any particular opinion, has never failed to excite great indignation in all ages and nations, in which a contrary opini|nion has been generally received and that particular opinion can be proved to have exi&s;ted in any age or country when it did not excite indignation, it may be concluded that it had many partizans in that age or country. For the opinion being the &s;ame, it could not of it&s;elf be more re&s;pectable: and human nature being the &s;ame, it could not but have been regarded in the &s;ame light, &s;o long as the &s;ame &s;tre&s;s was laid on the opo&s;ite opinion. Summary View No. 1.11.12.</P>
<P N="13">13 When a time is given, in which any very remarkable and intere&s;ting opinion was not believed by a certain cla&s;s of people, and another time in which the belief of it was general, the introduction of &s;uch an opinion may always be known by the effects which it will produce upon the minds, and in the conduct of men; by the alarm which it will give to &s;ome, and the defence of it by others. If, therefore, no aim was given, and no defence of it was made within any particular period, it may be concluded that the
<PB N="57" REF="018741_0056_0FA81BA263004038">
introduction of it did not take place within that period. Sum|mary View, No. 2, 3, 6</P>
<P N="14">14. When any particular opinion or practice, is nece&s;&s;arily of cu&s;tomarily accompanied by any other opinion or practice; if the latter be not found within any particular period, it may be pre&s;umed that the former did not exi&s;t within that period. Summary View, No. 5.</P>
<P>It will be perceived that the whole of this hi&s;torical evidence is in favour, of the proper unitarian doctrine, or that of Chri&s;t being a mere man, having been the faith of the primitive church, in oppo&s;ition to the Arian no le&s;s than the Trinitarian hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>As to the Arian hypothe&s;is in particular, I do not know that it can be traced any higher than Arius him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t the age in which he lived. Both the Gno&s;tics and the Platonizing chri&s;|tians, were equally far from &s;uppo&s;ing that Chri&s;t was a being <HI>created out of nothing;</HI> the former having thought him to be an emanation from the &s;upreme being, and the latter the logos of the Father per&s;onified. And though they &s;ometimes applied the term <HI>creation</HI> to this <HI>per&s;onification,</HI> &s;till they did not &s;uppo&s;e it to have been a creation out of nothing. It was only a new modification of what exi&s;ted before. For God, they &s;aid, was always, <HI>logik<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> or had within him that principle which afterwards a&s;&s;umed a per&s;onal character.</P>
<P><HI>Upon the whole, the Arian hypothe&s;is appears to me to be de&s;titute of all &s;upport from chri&s;tian antiquity. Whereas it was never denied that the proper unitarian doctrine exi&s;ted in the time of the apo&s;tles; and I think it evident, that it was the faith of the bulk of chri&s;tians, and e&s;pecially the unlearned chri&s;tians, for two or three centuries after Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
