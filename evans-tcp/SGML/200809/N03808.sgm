<P>&mdash; If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I go to the FATHER.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are the Words of our ble&s;&s;ed SA|VIOUR; and he &s;pake them to his Di&s;|ciples, at a Time, when their <HI>Hearts were troubled.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;e was this: The Hour being ju&s;t come, in which he knew, he &s;hould depart out of the World, he tho't proper to acquaint his Di&s;|ciples with it. <HI>Yet a little while,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am with you.</HI> And again, <HI>Whither I go ye cannot come</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preceeding Chap. Ver 33.</NOTE>. At this &s;ad, and unexpected News, they were filled with Grief. They could not bear the Tho't of parting with &s;o dear a Friend, &s;o good a Ma&s;ter and Lord.</P>
<P>Upon which, that they might not be <HI>&s;wallowed up of overmuch Sorrow,</HI> our compa&s;&s;ionate SAVIOUR proceeds to &s;ay that, which might have a tendency
<PB N="2" REF="004687_0003_100DB8D6C1AF84C0">
to ea&s;e their Minds, and make them calm and quiet. He a&s;&s;ures them, <HI>in his</HI> FATHER<HI>'s Hou&s;e were many Man&s;ions</HI>; and that he was only going to <HI>prepare a Place,</HI> where <HI>he</HI> and <HI>they</HI> might be together for ever. <HI>I go,</HI> &s;ays he, Context, <HI>ver.</HI> 2, <HI>to prepare a Place for you. And if I go, and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my &s;elf, that where I am, there ye may be al&s;o</HI> As if he had &s;aid, "Tho' I am going from you, 'tis only for a Time; and this, in order to your Happine&s;s, to prepare <HI>Man&s;ions</HI> of Glory for you: Nor will it be long before I &s;hall &s;ee you again, and admit you into <HI>my</HI> FATHER<HI>'s Hou&s;e</HI>; when there &s;hall never more be a Seperation between us. A mo&s;t refre&s;hing Con&s;ideration this! enough to compo&s;e their Spirits, and make them chearful at parting with their deare&s;t SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>He then, after &s;ome other Di&s;&s;wa&s;ives from too much Grief, fetches Con&s;olation for them, in the Words of the Text, from that which was the Source of all their Sorrow on his Account, even <HI>their Love to him. If ye loved me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye would rejoyce, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I go to the</HI> FATHER. 'Tis as if he had &s;poken in &s;uch Language as this, "I have already told you, where I am going when I leave you; that I am going to the FATHER, to receive at his Hands, in Reward of my Services and Sufferings for the good of Men, <HI>a Name that is above every Name,</HI> at which, <HI>every Knee &s;hall bow, that is in Heaven, and that is on Earth:</HI> And &s;hall not this be Matter of <HI>Joy</HI> to you? If you love me, as I
<PB N="3" REF="004687_0004_100DB8D8E20AF740">
&s;ee you do by the Tears you drop, at the Pro&s;pect of my Departure from you, you cannot but <HI>rejoyce.</HI> There will, with your <HI>Sorrow,</HI> be a mixture of <HI>Joy.</HI> 'Tis fitting you &s;hould rejoyce for <HI>me,</HI> if you mourn for <HI>your &s;elves.</HI> Yea, your Regards to me will make you to rejoyce".</P>
<P>The Subject fairly offering it &s;elf to Con&s;idera|tion, as &s;uited to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, is this,</P>
<Q>Love to our decea&s;ed, pious Friends, and Relatives, &s;hould influence us to rejoyce, in Con&s;ideration they are gone to the <HI>FATHER.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>Sorrow,</HI> perhaps, we may imagine to be the mo&s;t proper Expre&s;&s;ion of Love, upon the departure of our pious Friends: And it may appear &s;trange, to hear it &s;aid, we ought to <HI>rejoyce. Joy,</HI> we may think unnatural; at lea&s;t, very unbecoming at &s;o mourn|ful a Time. But we are herein greatly mi&s;taken. There is no Occa&s;ion more proper for the exerci&s;e of <HI>religious Joy,</HI> than when our pious Relatives, tho' dear to us as our very Lives, are called out of the World: Nor is there a more generous Expre&s;&s;ion of our Love towards them. This our ble&s;&s;ed SA|VIOUR has taught us, by &s;aying to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>if ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I go to the</HI> FATHER.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this Subject, I &s;hall,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Say &s;ome Things tending to limit and explain the Truth of it.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="004687_0005_100DB8DA98349820">II. <HI>Illu&s;trate the Force of our</HI> SAVIOUR's <HI>Argument, by &s;howing what there is in the Con&s;ideration, that our pious, departed Friends, and Relatives are gone to the</HI> FATHER, <HI>that &s;hould influence us to rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P>The whole will then be followed with the APPLICATION that is proper.</P>
<P N="1">I. In order to <HI>limit, and explain the Truth in the Text,</HI> which is the fir&s;t Thing, let it be &s;aid as fol|lows,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, as if <HI>they did not love</HI> their Friends and Relatives, who <HI>mourn</HI> their decea&s;e. Oar SAVIOUR does not charge his Di&s;ciples with want of Love to him, becau&s;e they were in Tears at the foretho't of hi&s; Death. He knew they had a tender Affection for him; and indeed, this is &s;uppos'd as the Cau&s;e of all their Sorrow, in the Argument, he here u&s;es with them. Nor may our lamenting the Decea&s;e of our <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Friends, be look'd upon as an In&s;tance of want of Love to them. So far from this, that the very Rea|&s;on why we mourn for them is, becau&s;e we <HI>love them.</HI> Love is the Spring from whence all our Tears flow: Nor, if we did not love them, &s;hould we be affected with Grief at their departure from us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor, yet, is our SAVIOUR to be under&s;tood, as tho' he meant to <HI>prohibit our &s;orrowing,</HI> at the Death of our dear Relatives. He does not find Fault with his Di&s;ciples for expre&s;&s;ing their Grief at the News of his approaching Departure. We may rather
<PB N="5" REF="004687_0006_100DB8DE1096CF98">
&s;uppo&s;e, he was plea&s;ed to think they were &s;o much his Friends, and that he was like to die lamented by them. He takes Care indeed to re&s;train their Grief within due Bounds. And immoderate Sorrow is always a Fault, let the Friend or Relative, we are called to part with, be ever &s;o dear. But as to the Thing it &s;elf, 'tis not to be condemned. We may lawfully mourn, if we don't mourn too much; yea, all the natural Expre&s;&s;ions of Sorrow, are but a decent Re&s;pect to the Memory of our departed Friends. 'Tis Stupidity, not true Greatne&s;s of Mind, to be unmoved at their Death. Our SAVIOUR him|&s;elf <HI>wept</HI> over the Grave of his <HI>dead</HI> Friend <HI>Lazarus.</HI> And that is the Remark made upon it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 11.36.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, how he loved him!</HI> And if Tears were a proper Expre&s;|&s;ion of Love from our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, they cannot be an un&s;uitable one from us. He who was <HI>once toucht with the feeling of our Infirmities,</HI> and knows our Frame, and the Weakne&s;s of it, will indulge us in a few Tears, on the Death of a beloved Friend; yea, he would take it ill, if we &s;hould &s;uffer them to die unlamented by us. To go on,</P>
<P N="3">3. When we are bid to rejoyce on Occa&s;ion of the Death of pious Friends and Relations, the Mean|ing is, we &s;hould, at lea&s;t, <HI>mix &s;ome Joy with our Sorrow.</HI> Sorrow there will be, and there ought to be Joy al&s;o: Nor will the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions de&s;troy each other. They may both &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame Brea&s;t;
<PB N="6" REF="004687_0007_100DB8DF99CD4150">
and indeed, there is ju&s;t Rea&s;on, upon the Death of every valuable and pious Friend, for the Excite|ment of both the&s;e different Affections. For in all &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations, there is "a <HI>dark</HI> and a <HI>bright</HI> Side"; there is <HI>"our Lo&s;s,</HI> and <HI>their Gain":</HI> And while we <HI>mourn</HI> the one, we &s;hould <HI>rejoyce</HI> at the other. When we con&s;ider their Death in Re&s;pect of <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> the Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s we are deprived of, as well as the Inconveniencies, Diffi|culties and Troubles, we are become expo&s;ed to, we have Rea&s;on to be <HI>grieved,</HI> and ought to be &s;o: But when we turn our Thoughts, and take a View of their Death, in Re&s;pect of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> the Mi&s;e|ries they are freed from, and the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s they are gone to partake of, there is proper Occa&s;ion for <HI>Joy,</HI> and we ought, in Love to them, to <HI>rejoyce.</HI> But there may be a further Meaning in the Words. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="4">4. When Love to our departed Friends is &s;poken of as that which &s;hould influence us to rejoyce, the Sen&s;e is, we &s;hould <HI>rather</HI> rejoyce than mourn; our Joy &s;hould be <HI>greater</HI> than our Sorrow. <HI>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce.</HI> The Words are <HI>compa|rative</HI>; "Ye would be in a Frame of Mind di&s;|po&s;ing you to the exerci&s;e <HI>rather</HI> of Joy than Grief; ye would nor <HI>&s;o much</HI> mourn, as be glad and triumph." Not that an outward Joy, expre&s;&s;ed in Merriment and Laughter, is here at all encoura|ged; &s;o far from it, that it would be a mon&s;trous Incongruity, 'Tis an inward, rational Satisfaction, that our SAVIOUR would recommend; a Joy ari&s;ing
<PB N="7" REF="004687_0008_100DB8E335E17CD0">
from the Principles of Religion: And &s;uch a Joy does mo&s;t become us, upon Occa&s;ion of the Death of pious, tho' the deare&s;t Relatives: And we &s;hould <HI>chiefly</HI> be in the Exerci&s;e of it, as being the mo&s;t noble, and truly <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Expre&s;&s;ion of our Love to them. <Q>'Tis a poor, ordinary Frame to mourn for our Dead, as ari&s;ing from meer &s;en&s;itive Na|ture. One needs no Improvement of Mind in order to this. There needs neither <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> nor <HI>Chri&s;tianity, Vertue</HI> nor <HI>Religion,</HI> to teach us this low Le&s;&s;on; but to rejoyce in their happy Change, to be glad that they are laid in a Bed of ever|la&s;ting Re&s;t, while we &s;uffer the Lo&s;s of their plea&s;ant Society; this is generous and truly no|ble Love! This is &s;uch an ingenuous greatne&s;s of Mind, as is only the product of <HI>divine Faith,</HI> and <HI>chri&s;tian Hope</HI>; which regulates our Love, and rai&s;es it to &s;uch a Pitch, as nothing below the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD, and the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> can advance it to.</Q></P>
<P>But having &s;aid, what may be tho't &s;ufficient to limit, and explain the Truth in the Text, I now go on,</P>
<P N="2">II. To illu&s;trate the Force of our SAVIOUR's Argument, <HI>by &s;howing what there is, in the Con&s;ide|ration that our pious, decea&s;ed Friends are gone to the</HI> FATHER, <HI>that &s;hould influence us to rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P>Now this includes in it &s;everal Things, all which are &s;o many ju&s;t Rea&s;ons for rejoycing.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="004687_0009_100DB8E4C33D6820">1. Their being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER obviou&s;ly &s;up|po&s;es, that they are <HI>&s;till alive.</HI> Tho' they are dead, their Being is not extinct; they are not fallen from their Exi&s;tence. Their Bodies, 'tis true, are rendred &s;en&s;ele&s;s and inactive, but not &s;o their Souls. Death has had no Effect upon <HI>the&s;e,</HI> but to tran&s;late them to the other World; where they &s;till live, &amp; act more perfectly than ever. <Q>'Tis with them as with the Sun; at Evening it leaves our Horizon under di&s;con&s;olate Darkne&s;s, and &s;ome weak Per&s;ons may think it's Glory buried and extingui&s;hed; but 'tis only gone to the o|ther Hemi&s;phere, and there &s;hines with as much Beauty and Brightne&s;s as ever.</Q> A mo&s;t re|viving Tho't this! And &s;hould fill our Souls with Joy and Gladne&s;s. If, at Death, the Friends whom we loved like our &s;elves, went out of Being; if there was now an End put to their Exi&s;tence, we might well <HI>refu&s;e to be comforted, becau&s;e they are not.</HI> But the Ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. Tho' they are <HI>dead,</HI> they are <HI>yet alive:</HI> They are only <HI>gone to the</HI> FA|THER. And &s;hall we not <HI>rejoyce</HI> at this? We may break forth in the Language of good old <HI>Jacob,</HI> upon the News of his Son <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Welfare, <HI>It is enough, be is alive.</HI> Our dead Friends are alive; they are alive with GOD in another and better World, as truly &s;o as ever they were in this.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER plainly in|tends that they are gone to be <HI>rewarded by him,</HI> Their full Reward they won't indeed receive, till the Day of the appearing of the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> when
<PB N="9" REF="004687_0010_100DB8E745EC4410">
he &s;hall &s;ay to them in tho&s;e Words, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the Foundation of the World.</HI> But they are no &s;ooner dead, but they begin to be happy. The Day of their Death is the Day of their En|trance upon the future Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. So the holy Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> heard it declared by a Voice from Heaven. <HI>I heard,</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 14.13.</NOTE> &s;ays he, <HI>a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying unto me, write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the Dead which die in the</HI> LORD <HI>from</HI> HENCEFORTH: <HI>yea, &s;aith the</HI> SPI|RIT, <HI>that they may re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>what is this Reward,</HI> our pious Friends and Relatives receive by <HI>going to the</HI> FATHER? To which I would &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. They hereby obtain <HI>Deliverance from Sorrow and Trouble of every Kind.</HI> While <HI>here</HI> they were &s;ubjected to Grief and Pain, and often groaned un|der the unea&s;y Burdens that were laid upon them; but being gone to the FATHER, they are forever &s;et free from tho&s;e innumerable Di&s;tre&s;&s;es &amp; Sorrows, which imbitter the pre&s;ent Life, and render it &s;o uncomfortable, even under the mo&s;t advantageous Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>They have now nothing to di&s;quiet them; no Cares, nor Fears; no Lo&s;&s;es, Cro&s;&s;es, nor Di&s;ap|pointments; no painful Di&s;ea&s;es, nor pining Sick|ne&s;s; no wearine&s;s, nor faintne&s;s; neither Hun|ger,
<PB N="10" REF="004687_0011_100DB8EAB35791E8">
nor Thir&s;t. The&s;e Occa&s;ions of Grief are all pa&s;t; they are eternally at re&s;t from them all.</P>
<P>Nor are they now expos'd to tho&s;e <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Griefs, which once pained their pious Minds. They have no Doubts of the Love of GOD, for they are in the actual Enjoyment of it; they have no Fears lea&s;t they are not intere&s;ted in the great SAVIOUR, for they are with him in PARADISE; they have no Su&s;picion of their own Uprightne&s;s, for they have been approv'd of their Judge, and are <HI>entred into the Joy of their Lord</HI>; they have no Complaints to make of their Frailties and Imperfections, the want of Love, and Zeal, and Activity, in the Service of GOD, for they are now in his Pre&s;ence <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle,</HI> and do his Will, with like Perfection, as do the holy Angels.</P>
<P>Neither are our departed pious Friends liable to Grief, on Account of tho&s;e Effects of their Death, that are apt to trouble us. We are touch'd with Concern and Pity to &s;ee them called away from their earthly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and worldly Accommoda|tions; we are grieved to behold their Gha&s;tline&s;s and Deformity, and weep bitterly when they are laid in the Grave to be de&s;troyed by Worms; we are moved with Sorrow to think, they are gone from our World, &s;o that we &s;hall &s;ee them no more, nor enjoy their Society which was once &s;o plea&s;ant to us. We often &s;peak of &s;uch Things as the&s;e; or, at lea&s;t, employ our melancholy Thoughts upon them: But &s;o do not they. It troubles them not, they have left this Earth, with its greate&s;t Advan|tages;
<PB N="11" REF="004687_0012_100DB8EC3B94BF20">
it moves them not, their Bodies are laid in the Du&s;t, to return to Du&s;t; yea, 'tis no Matter of Unea&s;ine&s;s to them, they are parted from their Husbands or Wives, once dear to them as their very Souls: Nor are they in Sorrow, they are gone from their de&s;irable Children, who, it may be, are become poor, helple&s;s, de&s;titute Orphans. <HI>We</HI> are troubled at this, and it once cau&s;ed great Sorrow of Heart to <HI>them.</HI> They were grieved at the Tho't of leaving their beloved Children; it bore hard upon their tender Minds; they found it difficult to reconcile them&s;elves to the Will of Heaven in this Matter; it was one of the greate&s;t Trials to their Faith: But they are now above the reach of Sorrow from the&s;e, or any Con&s;iderations whatever. For being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are in that State, where there &s;hall be <HI>no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither &s;hall there be any more Pain. They &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more; neither &s;hall the Sun light on them, or any Heat: for the</HI> LAMB <HI>which is in the mid&s;t of the Throne, &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them to Fountains of Waters: And</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hall wipe away all Tears from all their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>And now, &s;hall we grieve for our departed Friends, who are thus delivered from the Mi&s;eries of this evil World? Is it not <HI>rather</HI> Matter of Joy, that they are redeemed from Sin, and the unhappy Fruits of it, and are po&s;&s;e&s;t of eternal Ea&s;e and Peace? Their Death is their JUBILEE, the Year of their Relea&s;e from the Trials and Labours, the Vexations, Fears &amp; Hazards, which attended them
<PB N="12" REF="004687_0013_100DB8EFA64F8A78">
in the pre&s;ent State; yea, from all manner of Evil. And &s;hall we not rejoyce? We have ju&s;t Ground for a holy Joy: And we &s;hall certainly be in the Exerci&s;e of it, if we have any <HI>religious</HI> Love for the&s;e our <HI>dead</HI> Friends. If we mourn, let it be for <HI>our &s;elves</HI>; as for <HI>them,</HI> there is no Cau&s;e of Sor|row; true Love will rather urge us to rejoyce.</P>
<P N="2">2. By being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are not only delivered from all Manner of Grief and Trou|ble, but have entred upon the Enjoyment of <HI>po&s;i|tive Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are gone to a <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Place</HI>; called, in Scripture, &s;ometimes <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s <HI>Bo&s;om</HI>; &s;ometimes <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>; &s;ometimes the <HI>City, who&s;e Builder and Maker is GOD.</HI> And to be &s;ure, 'tis a Place of exceeding great Joy &amp; Delight. For 'tis the Place, where the SUPREAM MAJESTY dwells, and has erected the Throne of his Glory, and makes the brighte&s;t Manife&s;tations of Him&s;elf to the ineffable Happine&s;s of his Creatures.</P>
<P>Being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are gone to the <HI>be&s;t and mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Company.</HI> They are gone to dwell with <HI>Patriarchs, Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI>; with their pious departed <HI>Friends,</HI> and <HI>Progenitors</HI>; and with all, whom GOD, in all Ages, from the Days of <HI>Adam,</HI> has been &s;electing from among Men, and preparing to be Heirs to the future, eternal Inhe|ritance; yea, they are gone to <HI>an innumerable Com|pany of Angels, to</HI> JESUS <HI>the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to</HI> GOD <HI>the Judge of all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004687_0014_100DB8EE169111B0">Being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are gone to the <HI>mo&s;t noble Employment</HI>; to wor&s;hip and &s;erve the GOD that made them, without Interruption, with|out Wearine&s;s, without Sin, without the lea&s;t Frailty or Imperfection: Being ever full of Love, Reve|rence &amp; Obei&s;ance, they are ever in a Di&s;po&s;ition to the Work of Prai&s;e and Adoration; yea, they <HI>cea&s;e not Day nor Night, &s;aying, with a loud Voice, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be to</HI> HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE, <HI>and to the</HI> LAMB <HI>for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, being <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they are gone to be made <HI>perfected Spirits in Glory</HI>; perfect in the Love of GOD; perfect in the Service of GOD; perfect in the Enjoyment of GOD, that GOD, <HI>in who&s;e Pre&s;ence is fulne&s;s of Joys, and at who&s;e right Hand flow Rivers of Plea&s;ures for ever more.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall we now mourn for the&s;e our departed Friends? What is the genuine influence of true Love? Does it not put us upon wi&s;hing the Hap|pine&s;s of our dear Relatives? And does it not con&s;train us to rejoyce, when they come to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? And &s;hall we not then be glad, when we take a view of them, as <HI>gone to the</HI> FA|THER, as gone to the Glories of the upper and eter|nal World? However it may appear to an <HI>Eye of Sen&s;e,</HI> 'tis, in the <HI>Eye of Faith,</HI> a ble&s;&s;ed Truth, that our departed, <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Friends are gone to a <HI>Pa|radi&s;e</HI> of Delight, where they have <HI>perfected Spirits,</HI> and <HI>glorious Angels</HI> to conver&s;e with; yea, and an

<HI>infinite GOD</HI> to enjoy: And are the&s;e fit Per&s;ons to be lamented? O no! The greater our Love to them, the more &s;hould we exult at their Felicity. Can we find in our Hearts to de&s;ire they &s;hould leave the Company of Heaven for our's? Would we, were it in our Power, recal them from the Joys of GOD's right Hand? Certainly, our Love to them will nor &s;uffer us to be &s;o unkind: nor &s;hould we &s;o much grieve for our &s;elves, as rejoyce for them, that they are ble&s;&s;ed in the Kingdom of their FATHER. To go on,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Truth that we are upon, that our pious, departed Friends are <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, &s;ugge&s;ts this further Ground of Joy, that they are <HI>gone to the &s;ame Place, whither we our &s;elves, if good Chri&s;ti|ans, &s;hall go our &s;elves.</HI> Our SAVIOUR, not only tells his Di&s;ciples, in the Context, that he was <HI>going from them</HI>; but adds for their Con&s;olation, <HI>that where he was, there they &s;hould be al&s;o</HI>; in the &s;ame Place, with the &s;ame FATHER. This al&s;o is our Comfort upon the Death of pious Relatives. Where they are gone, we &s;hall go our &s;elves, if Partakers of the &s;ame Faith and Holine&s;s with them. They are not gone where we cannot come, but to the "&s;ame Harbour we are bound to, and are upon our Voyage for; Nay, where we our &s;elves have already <HI>ca&s;t Anchor,</HI> by a &s;tedfa&s;t Hope, tho' we are not yet landed, as they are". And what a Motive to Joy is this? Whither could we wi&s;h our Friends, but where they are gone? They are gone to the very Place, we call our <HI>Home</HI>; to the
<PB N="15" REF="004687_0016_100DB8F3ECEF2898">
very Place, whither we are ha&s;tening our &s;elves; yea, to the very Place, which is the great Object of our De&s;ires and Hopes, of our Prayers and En|deavours. O what a joyful Con&s;ideration is this! How &s;hould it fill our Hearts with Gladne&s;s! 'Tis Love to our Friends that makes us grieve, becau&s;e they are gone from us: and &s;hould not the &s;ame Principle cau&s;e us to rejoyce al&s;o? &s;ince they are gone, where we &s;hall &s;ee them again, and live with them again, and that for ever. If we are our &s;elves truly pious, having good Hope towards God, it will be Matter of Joy to us, upon the Death of chri&s;tian Relatives, to extend our View to GOD's eternal Kingdom, in expectation of Meeting, and dwelling with them in that ble&s;&s;ed Place.</P>
<P>The APPLICATION yet remains. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. How <HI>joyful</HI> &s;hould be the tho't of dying to <HI>Chri&s;tians them&s;elves!</HI> To be &s;ure, if they &s;hould rejoyce, that their departed pious Friends are <HI>gone to the</HI> FATHER, they &s;hould much more rejoyce at the Tho't of going there them&s;elves. And yet, how far are they, commonly, from being joyful on this Account? How unwelcome, to the gene|rality of Chri&s;tians, is the Tho't of dying, the one only way of <HI>going to the</HI> FATHER? When laid up|on a Bed of Sickne&s;s, and bro't within View of the Grave, how unwilling to go the Way, whence they &s;hall not return? How earne&s;t in their Reque&s;ts for a longer Reprieve? But 'tis certainly a Shame for Chri&s;tians, who are favoured with &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="004687_0017_100DB8F5AF9EEB00">
Hopes, to be unwilling to die. The Tho't of Death &s;hould be plea&s;ant to them; they &s;hould reflect upon going out of the World, with a holy triumph of Soul, as knowing they are <HI>going to the</HI> FATHER, to have all Tears wiped away from their Eyes, and to be crowned with Glory, Honour, &amp; Immortality, in GOD's everla&s;ting Kingdom.</P>
<P>If we were clearly &s;atisfied of this, we may be ready to &s;ay, we &s;hould be <HI>willing rather to be ab|&s;ent from the Body.</HI> Our <HI>De&s;ire would be to depart, and to be with</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which is far better.</HI></P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, 'tis only a <HI>good Hope,</HI> that we are in the Number of tho&s;e, who when they die, will go to <HI>be with the</HI> FATHER, and <HI>with his Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, that can make the Tho't of dying &s;et upon our Minds with Ea&s;e and Comfort.

the more likely we &s;hall be, to come to a fix'd, &s;a|tisfactory Hope of our good E&s;tate GODWARD: And having this <HI>good Hope thro' Grace,</HI> we &s;hall have no Cau&s;e of Fear upon the Pro&s;pect of Death; but may, at any Time, welcome a Me&s;&s;age to leave all Things here below; rejoycing in the Tho't, that we are now <HI>going to the</HI> FATHER: And we &s;hall have the more Rea&s;on for this, as &s;o many of our dear Relatives are gone before us. The Departure of every pious, amiable Friend, is a fre&s;h incentive to our De&s;ires to follow after, &s;ince we &s;hall go to the FATHER, and to <HI>them</HI> too: Nor can it be, but that the Tho't of Death &s;hould be highly plea&s;ant to us, while we reflect upon it, as that which will tran|&s;late us to tho&s;e Friends above, whom we loved &s;o much here below.</P>

<P>But I would be particular here in recommending this Duty of <HI>holy Joy</HI> to tho&s;e, who were the near Friends and Relatives of that <HI>amiable Per&s;on,</HI> whom we followed to the Grave the la&s;t Week.

with her: Yet, in Ju&s;tice to her Memory, I can't forbear &s;aying, The GOD, who made her, was pleas'd to give her a comely Body, &s;o that <HI>none was more prai&s;ed for Beauty than &s;he</HI>; but the Endow|ments of her <HI>Soul</HI> were far more worthy of Notice, as they were of &s;uperior Excellence.

<P>She was &s;ingularly <HI>&s;weet</HI> in the Temper of her Mind; not &s;oon angry, never pevi&s;h, never cla|morous: but on the contrary, calm and placid; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;erene Brea&s;t her &s;elf, and making all ea&s;y who were about her.</P>
