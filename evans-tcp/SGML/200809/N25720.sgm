<L>Some die upon the ocean, and &s;ome upon the land,</L>
<L>Yet &s;ince 'tis clear howe'er we &s;teer, that life's not under our command,</L>
<L>Let tempe&s;ts howl, and billows roll, and dangers pre&s;s;</L>
<L>Yet &s;pite of the&s;e there are &s;ome joys, us jolly tars to ble&s;s,</L>

<L>LUFF, luff, my lads the gale increa&s;es,</L>
<L>While we &s;cud before the wind;</L>
<L>Reef the main&s;ail, 'till it cea&s;es,</L>

<L>On the larboard tack we venture,</L>

<L>Fearing danger's all a notion,</L>

<L>JOVE'S a God of ten thou&s;and, the monarch I know,</L>
<L>Loves his bottle, girl, &s;ong, and a je&s;t,</L>
<L>Has a mon&s;t'rous regard for choice &s;pirits below,</L>
<L>And is charm'd when his creatures are ble&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he's vex'd when a fool takes it into his head,</L>
<L>That he's lo&s;t if he meddles with plea&s;ure;</L>
<L>And thinks; too, the fellow confounded ill bred,</L>
<L>To refu&s;e when he offers the trea&s;ure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When a zealot has turn'd up the white of his eyes,</L>
<L>With long phiz, and a puritan &s;train;</L>
<L>I have &s;een the God laugh; and in fun from the &s;kies,</L>
<L>Make up mouths at the blockhead again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then pu&s;h round the bottle, let each give his &s;ong,</L>
<L>Wit, humour, and friend&s;hip attend us,</L>
<L>And while for enjoyment our pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong,</L>
<L>Let's a&s;k not his God&s;hip to mend us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus we'll revel 'till morning peeps into our gla&s;s,</L>
<L>Then to &s;cenes of new rapture remove,</L>
<L>To embrace with devotion a wife or a la&s;s,</L>
<L>And be ble&s;t on the bo&s;om of love.</L>
