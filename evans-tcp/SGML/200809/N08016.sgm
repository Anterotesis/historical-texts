<P>NEW-ENGLAND has formerly been a place famous for religion in general, and for family wor&s;hip in particular; but of late, the neglect of this, as well as of other religious duties, has evidently been growing upon us; which has cau&s;ed much grief to pious &s;ouls: yet I have not heard that any di&s;cour&s;e has been publi&s;hed upon this &s;ubject here, the&s;e many years: and as there have lately heen numbers remarkably a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ened in &s;ome parts of the land, that were trai<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> up in the neglect of family prayer, who are &s;till at a lo&s;s about the &s;cripture authority for the daily practice thereof: Therefore the following con&s;i|derations, by the advice of friends, are humbly offered to the public.</P>

<Q><BIBL>I PETER, III. 7.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;That your Prayers be not hindred.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE in&s;pired author of this epi&s;tle, having &s;poken of the <HI>living &s;tone,</HI> which is <HI>di&s;|allowed indeed of men, but cho&s;en of God, and precious</HI>; on whom the &s;aints, <HI>as living &s;tones, are built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e</HI>: and having &s;hewn that tho' many &s;tumbled, and took offence at this glorious rock, yet that he is precious to believers, who are a <HI>peculiar people; that they &s;hould &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who hath called them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light:</HI> He then proceeds to lay down many in&s;tructions and exhortations con|cerning a right behaviour in their &s;everal circum|&s;tances and relations; and among the re&s;t. he &s;peaks particularly to hu&s;bands and wives, concerning how they ought to act towards each other; and gives this as a weighty con&s;ideration to move them to a right walk together, namely, <HI>That your prayers be
<PB N="4" REF="010232_0004_0F7DB5D5AFA8B2E8">
not hindered:</HI> As if he had &s;aid,
<Q>You are to main|tain a con&s;tant trade of <HI>coming</HI> to that <HI>living stone,</HI> and as you are heads of a family, you are daily to practice &s;ocial wor&s;hip: But if relative duties are neglected, and the adver&s;ary can prevail to make a breach between you, that will have a dreadful ten|dency to hinder your daily united prayers.</Q>
For, that <HI>family prayer</HI> is here intended, I think is plain from this con&s;ideration, viz. Injurious treatment, even from near friends, is &s;o far from hindering pious &s;ouls from <HI>per&s;onal</HI> addre&s;&s;es to the throne of grace, that it often makes them more forward and earne&s;t therein. In the prophet <HI>Micah</HI>'s time, when corrup|tion had &s;o far prevailed, that no faithful friend was to be &s;een, and the caution is given, <HI>Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bo&s;om</HI>; and when <HI>a man's enemies</HI> were <HI>the men of his own hou&s;e,</HI> then he &s;ays, <HI>Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my &s;alvation: My God will hear me.</HI> Micah vii. 5&mdash;7. Thus you may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e that the ill behaviour of wife or family may excite, in&s;tead of hindering &s;ecret prayer. (<HI>David</HI> &s;ays, <HI>For my love, they are my adver&s;aries: But I give my&s;elf unto prayer.</HI> P&s;al. cix 4.) But there mu&s;t be agreement in order for &s;ocial wor&s;hip: From whence it appears plain that family prayer is here intended; which I &s;hall attempt to &s;ay &s;omething farther upon, in the fol|lowing manner:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I &s;hall endeavour to open &s;omething of the na|ture of prayer in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Produce &s;ome &s;cripture evidences for the daily practice of family prayer in particular.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Labour to remove &s;ome hinderances that
<PB N="5" REF="010232_0005_0F7DB5D5B74C18F0">
&s;eem to lie in the way of this duty: And then clo&s;e with addre&s;&s;es to &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall endeavour to open &s;omething of the na|ture of prayer in general.</P>
<P>And I conceive that prayer is the &s;oul's approach to God through a glorious Mediator, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Holy Spirit, to pre&s;ent our &s;upplications, prai&s;es, &amp;c. unto him. David calls it a <HI>pouring out our hearts before him.</HI> P&s;al. lxii. 8. Which may be con|&s;idered as comprehending the &s;oul's expre&s;&s;ing its views of him, its regards to him, its de&s;ires of help from him, and its returns of gratitude for favours received. Here ob&s;erve, it is <HI>heart exerci&s;e.</HI> Many draw near with their mouths, while their hearts are far from God: But the prophet &s;ays, <HI>With my &s;oul have I de&s;ired thee in the night; yea, with my &s;pirit with|in me will I &s;eek thee early.</HI> I&s;ai. xxvi. 9. And in true prayer, the heart is <HI>poured out</HI>; the inmo&s;t griefs, burdens and de&s;ires of the &s;oul are laid open before God: Sins are confe&s;&s;ed, wants and mi&s;eries are pre|&s;ented, help is reque&s;ted, arguments are u&s;ed of va|rious kinds: Petitions and reque&s;ts are al&s;o brought for others, at home and abroad, in all places and re|lations. There is likewi&s;e in a right performance of this exerci&s;e, a &s;elf dedication and &s;urrender of our all unto God: As in P&s;al. cxix. 94. <HI>I am thine: Save me, for I have &s;ought thy precepts.</HI> See al&s;o I&s;ai. lxiv. 8, 9. Yea, the very nature of prayer implies in it an engagement to receive and improve what favours the Lord &s;hall grant, to his glory, and in a way of conformity to his will. Hence the work of prai&s;e is twice called by the &s;weet p&s;almi&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> a <HI>paying his vows,</HI> in P&s;al. cxvi. and in P&s;al. lxi. 4, 5, 8. he
<PB N="6" REF="010232_0006_0F7DB5D6713A7290">
&s;ays, <HI>I will trust in the covert of thy wings, for thou, O God, ha&s;t heard my vows.&mdash;So will I &s;ing prai&s;e unto thy name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.</HI> Here take good notice, that this duty was not to be performed only once in a year, month or a week; but it was his daily exerci&s;e; which leads me,</P>
<P N="2">II. To produce &s;ome &s;cripture evidences for the daily practice of family prayer in particular.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t &s;hall be taken from our relation to God as his children.</P>
<P>He is the father of all fle&s;h, as he gave them their exi&s;tence, and gives all their enjoyments: And he is the covenant-father in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to all regenerate &s;ouls. Now children, e&s;pecially little ones, as &s;aints are often called, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 3. John xiii. 33. 1 Joh. ii. 1.12, 13. and iv. 4. and v. 21.</NOTE> are bound both by duty and in|clination very often to come to their parents: And as it is not their bu&s;ine&s;s to provide for them&s;elves, or to be anxious about their future &s;upport, but to come to their parents for whatever they need; &s;o it is their duty, daily to come for in&s;tructions about what they &s;hould do, and faithfully to ob&s;erve the &s;ame. And how loudly does this &s;peak forth the im|portance of daily prayer? Hence, as our Saviour hath informed us that our Father knows what we need; &s;o he has taught us to pray after this manner, <HI>Our Father which art in heaven.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 9&mdash;13.</NOTE> Which words have been very ju&s;tly expounded as a le&s;&s;on that
<Q>teach|eth us to draw near to God with all holy reverence and confidence, as children to a father, able and ready to help us, and that we &s;hould pray <HI>with</HI> and <HI>for</HI> others.</Q>
And that he intended we &s;hould come
<PB N="7" REF="010232_0007_0F7DB5D8D85C2138">
in <HI>this manner</HI> unto our heavenly father, <HI>every day,</HI> appears exceeding plain from the fourth petition, which is, <HI>Give us</HI> THIS DAY <HI>our daily bread:</HI> For as bread (take it in a natural or &s;piritual &s;en&s;e) is what we need every day, and as it is <HI>the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 17.</NOTE> &s;o what can we do le&s;s than to a&s;k him for what we need, and give him thanks for what we receive? Chri&s;t does not &s;ay, give us this week, or this year, but give us <HI>this day</HI> our <HI>daily</HI> bread:&mdash;And tho' the father of our &s;pirits needs no information about our ca&s;e, yet he will <HI>be enquired of</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</NOTE> by us:&mdash;He will have us own our dependance on him, and our obligations to him. And as we have not only per&s;onal, but al&s;o family nece&s;&s;ities and mercies, and as we are taught to &s;ay, <HI>Our</HI> father, give <HI>us this</HI> day <HI>our</HI> daily bread, I think the evidence appears very clear from hence for the daily practice of family wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;piritual prie&s;thood of the &s;aints will afford further evidence for this duty. Our apo&s;tle in chap. ii. 5, 9. calls them <HI>a holy,</HI> and <HI>a royal prie&s;thood</HI>: And John &s;tiles them <HI>kings and prie&s;ts unto God.</HI> Rev. i. 6. Now the main bu&s;ine&s;s of the prie&s;ts was to mini&s;ter in God's &s;anctuary, and offer &s;acrifice upon his altar. Deut. xxxiii. 10. The high prie&s;t was an eminent type of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is now entered, not <HI>into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven it&s;elf, now to appear in the pre&s;ence of God for us.</HI> Heb. ix. 24. All the <HI>levitical</HI> &s;acrifees of atonement pointed out that <HI>one offering,</HI> by which he <HI>hath perfected forever them that are &s;anctified.</HI> Heb. x. 14. He alone has an&s;wered
<PB N="8" REF="010232_0008_0F7DB5DA5EF50C80">
for all our &s;ins: But their thank offerings and free|will-offerings were a figure of the gracious exerci&s;es of the &s;aints. It is their <HI>rea&s;onable &s;ervice</HI> to <HI>pre&s;ent their bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy and acceptable to God.</HI> Rom. xii. 1. And their liberality is called, <HI>an odour of a &s;weet &s;mell, a &s;acrifice acceptable, well-plea&s;ing to God.</HI> Phil. iv. 18. Heb. xiii. 16. Tho' what comes more directly to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, is that their prayers and prai&s;es are &s;o called. David under|&s;tood them &s;o in his day: <HI>Let my prayer</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>be &s;et forth before thee as incen&s;e; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening &s;acrifice.</HI> P&s;al. cxli. 2. And John &s;peaks repeatedly of <HI>odours</HI> and <HI>incen&s;e</HI> which came <HI>with the prayers of the &s;aints.</HI> Rev. v. 8. and viii. 3, 4. Tho&s;e &s;acrifices were to be pre&s;ented at God's altar, which &s;anctified the gift: Hence the &s;acred writer to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in explaining and im|proving the &s;piritual de&s;ign of tho&s;e ancient cere|monies, &s;ays, <HI>We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which &s;erve the tabernacle.</HI> Heb. xiii. 10. i. e. They that &s;till held to the &s;hadow when the &s;ub&s;tance was come, by their unbelief excluded them|&s;elves from the benefits of this glorious altar, from whence the prayers of all &s;aints a&s;cend up before God. The in&s;pired penman having mentioned the place and way of coming, proceeds to our duty in relation thereto.&mdash;<HI>By him therefore</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>let us offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.</HI> Ver. 15.</P>
<P>Now as he was writing to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> there is abundant rea&s;on to conclude that in this he has a particular reference to their <HI>morning</HI> and <HI>evening &s;a|crifice:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="010232_0009_0F7DB5DAF30B0058">
for in the fir&s;t appointment thereof, they were told that it was what they &s;hould offer upon the altar <HI>day by day continually</HI>; and that it &s;hould be a <HI>continual</HI> burnt-offering throughout their generations. Exod. xxix. 38, 42. And it is afterwards called <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>continual burnt offering,</HI> no le&s;s than ten times in two chapters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxviii. 3, 6, 10, 15, 24, 31. and xxix. 11, 16, 19, 22.</NOTE> How clear, then, does the evidence ap|pear, that the command to offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to God <HI>continually,</HI> intends that chri&s;tians &s;hould be as con&s;tant in their offerings of prai&s;e as the <HI>Jews</HI> were in their morning and evening &s;acrifice?</P>
<P>It might be farther ob&s;erved, that the word <HI>conti|nually,</HI> is repeatedly explained by <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> to mean the &s;ame as <HI>every day.</HI> I&s;ai. li. 13. and lii. 5. And it is u&s;ed in three places in &s;cripture for per&s;ons daily diet. <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Mephibo&s;heth, Thou &s;halt eat bread at my table</HI> continually. 2 Sam. ix.. 7. (See al&s;o 2 King. xxv: 29. Jer. lii. 33.) with which compare P&s;al. lv. 17. <HI>Evening and morning, and at noon, will I pray and cry aloud, and he &s;hall hear my voice:</HI> By which it appears that his addre&s;&s;es to God, were as frequent and con|&s;tant as his &s;tated meals: and that was according to the divine command in Deut. viii. 10. <HI>When thou ha&s;t eaten, and art full, then thou &s;halt ble&s;s the Lord thy God, for the good land which he hath given thee.</HI> And the cu&s;tom of looking to God for a ble&s;&s;ing on their food was &s;o well known in <HI>Samuel</HI>'s time, that the <HI>young maidens</HI> that <HI>Saul</HI> and his &s;ervant met, could tell them concerning <HI>Samuel</HI>'s going up to the &s;acri|fice (or fea&s;t, as the margin reads it) that, <HI>The people will not eat until he come, becau&s;e he doth ble&s;s the &s;acri|fice, and afterwards they eat that be bidden.</HI> 1 Sam ix. 13. Which cu&s;tom we have &s;o fully confirmed by
<PB N="10" REF="010232_0010_0F7DB5DBC5DC3E80">
the example of our Lord and Ma&s;ter, that we have the accounts of his practi&s;ing of it, mentioned in no le&s;s than &s;even places by the evangeli&s;ts;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xiv. 19. and xv. 36. Mar. vi. 41. and viii. 6, 7. Luke ix. 16. John vi. 11, 23.</NOTE> and the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> not only imitated this example of his divine ma&s;ter,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvii. 35.</NOTE> but al&s;o declares, that the meats which &s;educers would command men to ab&s;tain from, <HI>God hath created to be received with thank&s;giving of them which believe and know the truth: for</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refu&s;ed, if it be received with thank&s;giving: for it is &s;anctified by the word of God, and prayer.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 3&mdash;5. What can be plainer than this is to &s;hew that we ought to practice prayer to God that he would <HI>&s;anctify</HI> our food to us when we partake of it, and give thanks to him for it. Nay the language of the text plainly &s;hews that we have no right to receive the good crea|ture without <HI>thank&s;giving:</HI> for the apo&s;tle holds forth that God created them for that end, namely, <HI>to be received with thank&s;giving</HI>: and he &s;ays, that nothing is to be refu&s;ed, IF <HI>it be received with thank&s;giving</HI>: q. d. They are all God's creatures, and we have no right to any of them without leave: well they are <HI>&s;anctified by the word of God and prayer</HI>; i. e. the word gives us war|rant to receive them in the way of prayer for a ble&s;&s;ing on them, and thank&s;giving for them; and in no o|ther way. For if we take them without this, what do we better than pilfering or robbing; as God charged the <HI>Jews</HI> with doing of old, <HI>Ye have robbed me, even this whole nation, therefore they had a cur&s;e e|ven on their ble&s;&s;ings, becau&s;e they would not lay it to heart to give glory to</HI> God<HI>'s name.</HI> Mal. ii. 2. and iii. 9.
<PB N="11" REF="010232_0011_0F7DB5DC712711A0">
This duty was &s;o well known in the primitive times of chri&s;tianity, that Paul founds his argument upon it, and gives it as a good rea&s;on why the weak belie|ver, who &s;till thought &s;ome meats to be unclean, &s;hould not judge him that believed they were clean, and &s;o partook of them, viz. becau&s;e, <HI>he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks.</HI> Rom. xiv. 6. By which it is plain that he did not &s;uppo&s;e that any believer would eat of God's good creatures with|out giving him thanks. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he &s;peaks to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> when he a&s;ks, <HI>Why am I evil &s;poken of for that for which I give thanks?</HI> And then adds this command, <HI>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or what|&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 30, 31. Should any &s;ay, that we may give thanks in our hearts, when it is not openly expre&s;&s;ed, I readily grant it; yet where a number make a meal together, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ought to &s;peak; and they mu&s;t have &s;trange notions indeed, who can hold that all the&s;e &s;cripture in&s;tructions and exam|ples refer only to the &s;ecret exerci&s;es of the heart!</P>
<P>Thus by the way I thought it proper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing concerning the right manner of receiving our food. Our</P>
<P N="3">3. Evidence for family prayer, &s;hall be drawn from ancient example. The Patriarch <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he was called of God out of his own country, into the land of <HI>Canaan</HI>; his heavenly friend fir&s;t ap|peared to him in the plain of <HI>Moreh,</HI> and there he builded an altar to him. Then he removed to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Bethel,</HI> and there built another, <HI>and called upon the name of the Lord.</HI> The like he did at <HI>Hebron:</HI> and &s;o did <HI>I&s;aac</HI> at <HI>Beer&s;heba,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> both ar <HI>She|chem,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="010232_0012_0F7DB5DEECB213E0">
and <HI>Bethel.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii 7, 8. and xiii. 18. and xxxiii. 20. and xxxv. 7.</NOTE> Thus the&s;e three eminent fathers, as they removed from place to place, in the place where they pitched their tents, and where their fami|lies dwelt, there they erected altars, and called on the name of the Lord: which &s;peaks forth family prayer &s;trongly indeed. And that <HI>David</HI> did the like, &s;eems to be clear from P&s;al. cxli. 2. So did our Lord with his di&s;ciples. Luk. xi. 1. The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>foot&s;teps of the flock,</HI> which we are directed to <HI>go forth by.</HI> Sol. Song i. 8. To which we may add,</P>
<P N="4">4. That many po&s;itive precepts, which we have in the New-Te&s;tament, plainly include family prayer; &s;uch as that, <HI>Pray without cea&s;ing: In every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, concerning you</HI> 1 The&s;. v. 17, 18 And that in Eph. vi. 18. <HI>Praying always with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit, and watching thereunto with all per&s;e|verance, and &s;upplication for all &s;aints.</HI> None will &s;up|po&s;e that to <HI>pray without cea&s;ing,</HI> and to <HI>pray always,</HI> intends that we &s;hould do nothing el&s;e but pray; yet &s;urely it implies the <HI>daily</HI> practice thereof: And we are here expre&s;ly required to give thanks, not only for &s;ome things, or upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, but <HI>in every thing</HI>; which mu&s;t include family favours as well as others: yea, we are commanded to pray <HI>al|ways</HI> with <HI>all prayer</HI>; and who dare &s;ay, that <HI>all prayer</HI> does not intend family prayer, as well as that which is &s;ecret, and that which is public? And the&s;e du|ties are to be ob&s;erved, not only for a &s;ea&s;on; but we are required to <HI>watch</HI> thereunto with <HI>all per&s;e|verance.</HI> Other pa&s;&s;ages might be mentioned to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but I &s;hall omit them, and ha&s;ten to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="13" REF="010232_0013_0F7DB5E005349C70">5. And la&s;tly, That this exerci&s;e is one character by which God's people are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others. When the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> would di&s;tin|gui&s;h the <HI>Heathen,</HI> which knew not God, from his people, he marks them out by this, that they were <HI>families</HI> that <HI>called not on God's name.</HI> Jer. x. 25.&mdash; Here let none mi&s;take, and think that an external ob&s;ervation of this duty is enough. Men may do that, and yet be in a mi&s;erable &s;tate: but it is with this, as it is with morality; though a per&s;on may have outward morality without &s;aving grace, yet an immoral man is a wicked man: So here, they may pray in their families and clo&s;ets too, who&s;e hearts are not right with God; but prayerle&s;s families are called <HI>heathen</HI> families.</P>
<P>Thus I have touched upon &s;ome of the evidences from &s;cripture, that we have for this practice, which are &s;o plain, that it may well &s;eem &s;trange that any, who hold to the &s;criptures, &s;hould neglect it; but &s;ince many do, I &s;hall proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To labour to remove &s;ome hinderances that &s;eem to lie in the way of this duty. And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I have known &s;ome who would allow that family prayer was a good cu&s;tom enough, but deni|ed there being any command for it. But if Chri&s;t has required us to come with the language of <HI>Our father,</HI>&mdash;to a&s;k that he would give us <HI>this day our daily bread,</HI> which &s;o &s;trongly implies that we &s;hould come thus <HI>every day</HI>; and if we are commanded to offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to God <HI>continually,</HI> which word is &s;o often u&s;ed for the morning and evening &s;acrifice; and if <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> practi|ced calling on the name of the Lord, wherever their

families dwelt; if <HI>David,</HI> and al&s;o Chri&s;t him&s;elf did the like; are we commanded to pray <HI>alway,</HI> with <HI>all prayer,</HI> and are hu&s;bands and wives required to walk &s;o together that their prayers may not be hindered; and have we &s;o many precepts and examples for this exerci&s;e at meal-times; and are &s;uch called heathen families, that call not on God's name, (as has been proved above) what would mortals de&s;ire more to prove to them that God requires them thus to prac|tice? Should any (to evade the force of this rea&s;on|ing) &s;ay, That the&s;e prie&s;ts, altars and &s;acrifices that have been &s;o often mentioned, refer to old <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ce|remonies, that have been long out of date: In re|ply, I would de&s;ire to a&s;k &s;uch per&s;ons a few que&s;ti|ons.&mdash;Were not tho&s;e ancient ceremonies of God's appointment? And had he not &s;ome wi&s;e de&s;ign therein? Were they not &s;hadows of good things to come? Yea, and were they not a part of the &s;crip|tures that were written for <HI>our learning</HI>? Where is the chri&s;tian that dare deny the&s;e things? Surely then, in&s;tead of di&s;regarding of them, we ought to give the <HI>more earne&s;t heed</HI> to the&s;e things which were fir&s;t re|pre&s;ented by &s;uch lively figures, and that have been &s;o clearly explained to us in the new-te&s;tament. But,</P>
<P>I &s;hall come, &s;econdly, to that which I take to be the greate&s;t hinderance of this duty, and that is, <HI>the want of a frame and inclination for it.</HI> "Prayer (&s;ay many) &s;hould be heart exerci&s;e, and when the <HI>I&s;ra|elites hearts were not right with God,</HI> their prayers were looked upon as <HI>flatteries</HI> and <HI>lies.</HI>" P&s;al. lxxviii. 36, 37. But is it not &s;trange that tho&s;e &s;inners <HI>crimes</HI> are now brought for others <HI>excu&s;e</HI>? They <HI>refu&s;ed to walk in</HI> God's <HI>law</HI>; and in&s;tead of taking a thankful no|tice
<PB N="15" REF="010232_0015_0F7DB5E149056708">
of his dealings, they <HI>forgot his works, and his wonders that he had &s;hewed them.</HI> Ver. 10, 11. And in&s;tead of &s;eeking to him for their food, they rather que&s;tioned whether he was able to &s;upply them or not: they &s;aid, <HI>Can God furni&s;h a table in the wil|derne&s;s?</HI> ver. 19. And when he had given them abun|dant evidence of his power and goodne&s;s, and al&s;o &s;ome awful rebukes for their wickedne&s;s; yet, <HI>for all this, they &s;inned &s;till: and believed not for all his wondrous works.</HI> Ver. 32. They &s;tood it out 'till death &s;tared them in the face, and then they would pray. <HI>When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him.</HI> Ver. 34. This is the old way that wicked men have trodden. And, O &s;oul, do&s;t thou chu&s;e their path! They, it &s;eems, would not mock God while they thought they could do without him: no, then they <HI>turned their back un|to him, and not their face: but in the time of their trou|ble, they will &s;ay, Ari&s;e and &s;ave us</HI>! Jer. ii. 27.</P>
<P>One dreadful ingredient in this excu&s;e, is, making our own inclination, in&s;tead of the divine precept, our rule: for though the command is to <HI>pray always with all prayer,</HI> yet the import of this objection is, "Becau&s;e I have not an inclination to &s;uch exerci&s;es, therefore I am excu&s;ed from regarding of them." Horrid excu&s;e with a witne&s;s! Yet horrid as it is, a great deal of pains has been taken to dre&s;s it up, &s;o that its odiou&s;ne&s;s may not appear. Some will plead that &s;aints are called to liberty; but that to pray when they have not freedom of mind for it, would be to work under a yoke of bondage: but &s;uch greatly mi&s;take the nature of the &s;aints liberty, a great part of which, is their open acce&s;s to the Fa|ther, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in all their wants.

contrary to any &s;uch thing. Prayer is for a needy creature to come to God for what it wants, and thank him for what it receives: and &s;urely there is a great difference between a guilty or mi&s;erable creature that comes to <HI>beg</HI> for pardon and help, and a merchant that comes with his goods to <HI>trade</HI> for more. The <HI>beggar,</HI> the more de&s;titute he finds him&s;elf, the more earne&s;t and ince&s;&s;ant are his cries: but the <HI>trader,</HI> if his goods fail, he draws off 'till he can get more. And <HI>Mary</HI> &s;ays, that the Lord <HI>hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath &s;ent empty away</HI> Luk. i. 53. Hence it appears that this very plea &s;prings from a proud, &s;elf-righteous di&s;po&s;ition. It implies as much as this, that if I feel in a good frame of mind, and have &s;omething that is good to bring, then I will come, and if not, I will &s;tay away. David once got into &s;uch a frame that he <HI>kept &s;ilence,</HI> 'till God's hand was &s;o heavy upon him that he could hold in no longer; then he confe&s;&s;ed his tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons, and the Lord forgave his &s;ins: and he adds, <HI>for this &s;hall every one that is godly, pray unto him.</HI> P&s;al. xxxii. 3&mdash;6.

I would earne&s;tly de&s;ire you to view the incon&s;i&s;ten|cy that there is between your profe&s;&s;ion and practice. It is generally allowed, that a leading point in the profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity, is the ordinance of bapti&s;m, notwith&s;tanding men's different judgments about the time and manner of admini&s;tering of it. And tho&s;e who hold to infant bapti&s;m, often bring this as a great argument therefor, viz. That their children will be <HI>heathens</HI> if they are not baptized: while &s;ome others can hardly look upon any to be <HI>christians</HI> that have not been baptized by immer&s;ion. Now, rea|der, art thou of either of the&s;e &s;entiments, what con|&s;i&s;tency can there be between thy profe&s;&s;ion and thy conduct? If of the former, then how can&s;t thou prove that thy family are <HI>chri&s;tians,</HI> when they have the very badge of <HI>heatheni&s;m</HI> that the prophet di&s;tin|gui&s;hes them by? And if thou art of the latter &s;en|timent, how can thy character be any better &s;ecured, while &s;o important an article of chri&s;tian behaviour is neglected. Bapti&s;m is a <HI>putting on Chri&s;t,</HI> and con|tains an engagement to <HI>walk in newne&s;s of life.</HI> Rom. vi. 4. But if we think that one act, without living &s;uch a life, will an&s;wer, &s;hall find our&s;elves greatly mi&s;taken. No doubt but thou wilt find that many outward difficulties, and inward &s;truggles will ri&s;e again&s;t prayer; as well as other duties: but if you will neglect them becau&s;e of that, I leave you to an|&s;wer it to him, who has &s;aid, <HI>Who&s;oever doth not hear his cro&s;s, and come after me, CANNOT be my di&s;ciple.</HI> Luk. xiv. 27.</P>

if any man draw back, Chri&s;t's &s;oul will have no plea|&s;ure in him: which is &s;et in a very &s;triking light in the 81&s;t P&s;alm, where God reminds his people of the wonders which he had done for them, and &s;ays, <HI>Thou called&s;t in trouble, and I delivered thee.&mdash;Hear, O my people, and I will te&s;tify unto thee:&mdash;There &s;hall no &s;trange god be in thee; I am the Lord thy God:&mdash; open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.</HI> As if he had &s;aid,

Depart from evil,</HI> &amp;c. P&s;a. xxxiv. 11, 12.
