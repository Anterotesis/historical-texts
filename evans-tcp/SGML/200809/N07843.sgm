<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the &s;ermons remark'd upon in the following &s;heets, were publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton in the year 1761, it may be a que&s;tion, Why no reply has been made to them long before this time; &s;eeing the doctor has therein attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h a doc|trine, &s;o directly contrary to the &s;entiments and preaching of many divines in New-England? To this, the author of what follows has only to &s;ay, That the &s;ermons had been long publi&s;hed be|fore he got &s;ight of them: After this, he waited, hoping and expecting, that &s;ome able hand would undertake an an&s;wer. But when he de&s;paired of this, he turned his thoughts this way, and has em|ployed his fir&s;t lei&s;ure hours, in attending to the &s;ubject. The re&s;ult of which, imperfect as it is, is now offered to the public. And none, it is hop|ed, will think it is ever too late to defend the truth.</P>
<P>BUT what need, may it be &s;aid, of entering in|to this controver&s;y at all? If the author had a de|&s;ire to publi&s;h his thoughts upon this &s;ubject, he had an undoubted right to do it: but what call was there to engage in a formal controver&s;y with Dr. Mayhew? If the truth is vindicated by &s;olid arguments, what has been &s;aid again&s;t it will fall of cour&s;e. There was no occa&s;ion therefore of making a formal attack upon the doctor's perfor|mance: this mu&s;t proceed from too great a for|wardne&s;s to run into controver&s;y, of which little good comes, and often much hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="010007_0006_0F7B996F34F2EA98">ANS. As this objection is again&s;t the common practice of chri&s;tian writers, from the early days, of chri&s;tianity to this time, and the men mo&s;t not|ed for wi&s;dom and piety, yea, Dr. Mayhew him|&s;elf among the re&s;t, the author thinks him&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently kept in countenance by their example.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, does not this appear to be the mo&s;t pro|per and effectual way, in many ca&s;es at lea&s;t, to detect error, and vindicate the truth? If errors are broached, and contended for by plau&s;ible argu|ments, how can they be detected, and the truth &s;et in an advantageous light, but by particularly &s;howing the fallacy of the pretended argument? If error is openly plead for, it tends to hurt the public, and lead many a&s;tray. And what likelier method can there be taken to prevent the mi&s;chief, than by particularly &s;hewing, how ill grounded and ab&s;urd the arguments are, with which it is &s;upport|ed, and pointing out the book in which they are found? If poi&s;on is publicly &s;old, and &s;pread a|mong the people, under pretence of its being a whole&s;ome food, a true friend to mankind, would not content him&s;elf with pointing out the real qua|lities of good food; but would di&s;cover the poi&s;on of that which pretended to be &s;uch, and tell them where it was, that they might be under advantage to &s;ee for them&s;elves, and avoid the danger.</P>
<P>Controver&s;y, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is too often managed, in an unfair manner, and with un|chri&s;tian heat and bitterne&s;s; and many times is diverted from fair rea&s;oning on the point to be di&s;puted, into per&s;onal quarrel and invectives. This can by no means be ju&s;tified; but it may, and often has been managed, greatly to the advan|tage
<PB N="iii" REF="010007_0007_0F7B996FCDE6C6E0">
of truth. It were ea&s;y to &s;hew, that this has been one &s;pecial and principal means, of the main|tenance and increa&s;e of light and truth in the chri|&s;tian church. One great end of God, in &s;uffering men of an uncommon genius to run into error, and &s;pend their lives in hard &s;tudy and labor, in order to maintain and propagate their tenets, and oppo&s;e the truth, it &s;eems has been, to awaken the attention of men hereby, e&s;pecially of the friends of truth; that, by a clo&s;e and thorough examination of the matter, the error may appear in all its weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency, and the oppo&s;ite truth be &s;et in a more clear and convincing light, than it could be, had it never been oppo&s;ed. To be &s;ure, that this has in fact been the event of controver&s;y and di&s;|pute, in many in&s;tances, none can doubt, who have been in any mea&s;ure attentive to the &s;tate of the chri&s;tian church. And the di&s;pute that a|ri&s;es on &s;uch occa&s;ions, is the means of awakening the attention of multitudes; by which they are the more prepared to receive conviction of the truth, when it &s;hines forth bright and victorious. When opponents are engaged in a doctrinal controver&s;y, not only the love of truth, their zeal for God and his cau&s;e, but their own per&s;onal intere&s;t and ho|nor, will be a powerful motive to &s;tudy and &s;earch oat the matter, and vindicate their cau&s;e in the be&s;t manner they can. And by-&s;tanders, who are properly attentive, and di&s;po&s;ed to embrace the truth wherever it appears, will hereby be under &s;pecial advantage to get in&s;truction: for it would be a wonder, if &s;ome new light is not &s;truck up by this means, even though the controver&s;y &s;hould not be managed every way in the be&s;t manner.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010007_0008_0F7B997065012118">What Dr. Mayhew &s;ays to this point, is wor|thy to be attended to here. Speaking of tho&s;e who greatly di&s;like controver&s;y and di&s;putes on matters of religion, he &s;ays, <Q>A third &s;ort, are tho&s;e good men, who &s;incerely love and practice religion them&s;elves, but yet are &s;uch great lovers of peace, of &s;uch a timid make, and &s;o apprehen|&s;ive of the bad effects of contention, that they think it be&s;t never to enter into debates on reli|gion, or any thing relative to it on any occa&s;i|on; and condemn tho&s;e who do &s;o, as at be&s;t imprudent and ill advi&s;ed per&s;ons. But &s;urely there may be ju&s;t and &s;ufficient cau&s;e for di&s;put|ing, if religion it&s;elf is of any great importance. We are enjoined to contend earne&s;tly for the faith.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> &amp;c. p. 5, 6.</NOTE> It may be added, the more earne&s;tly we contend, the better, if it be with chri&s;tian meekne&s;s and humility. If tho&s;e good, peaceable gentlemen, who are &s;o greatly aver&s;e to, and di&s;|gu&s;ted with all controver&s;y, were univer&s;ally hear|kened to, mo&s;t of the important doctrines of chri|&s;tianity, would &s;oon be given up, or lo&s;t in dark|ne&s;s and ignorance.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould be inclined to think, that the point here controverted, is not of importance enough, to require any great ado about it; and is a &s;uffici|ent rea&s;on again&s;t entering into a public debate upon it: they are de&s;ired to con&s;ider, that the que&s;tion in di&s;pute really is, What is the condition, on which men may obtain &s;alvation? or, What mu&s;t men do, in order to be intere&s;ted in God's favor, and have a title to eternal life? This is
<PB N="v" REF="010007_0009_0F7B9970EF3B7228">
therefore the mo&s;t intere&s;ting que&s;tion that can be thought of: and 'tis of the greate&s;t importance to all, that they make no mi&s;take here, but have a right under&s;tanding of the matter. For &s;urely nothing in religion is of greater importance, than that which teaches us how we may be &s;aved. If &s;alvation it&s;elf is of infinite importance, then 'tis of equal importance that we don't mi&s;take the terms on which it is to be obtained. What we chiefly want a revelation from God for, is, to teach us the terms of his favor, or the way of &s;alvation. And &s;ince a revelation is given chiefly for this end, &s;hall we think it a matter of &s;o little importance, as that 'tis not worth while to enquire into it, or contend for what we think to be the truth of the matter?</P>
<P>Dr. Mayhew thinks what he contends for, to be the &s;um of the glad tidings of the go&s;pel.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 76.</NOTE> Con|&s;equently, in his view, they do not preach nor under&s;tand the go&s;pel, who oppo&s;e him in this point. He therefore thinks it of great importance that it &s;hould be received.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE> 'Tis granted to be &s;o, if it is the truth. If it is not, it is of the la&s;t importance to him, and all others, that they &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of it, and embrace directly the contra|ry, as truth: which, doubtle&s;s appears as greatly im|portant, to tho&s;e who are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. They therefore may be allowed to contend earne&s;t|ly for it.</P>
<P>BUT however ju&s;t and important this controver|&s;y may be, it is &s;urely not well timed, &s;ome will &s;ay. Dr. Mayhew is now engaged in a good and important cau&s;e, in his controver&s;y with the epi&s;|copal
<PB N="vi" REF="010007_0010_0F7B9971AEE53020">
party in New-England. An appearance a|gain&s;t him at this time, may give &s;ome advantage to his other opponents, and tend to weaken his hands. At lea&s;t, this attack, at this time, looks unfriendly to the important and noble cau&s;e he has e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>ANS. That the cau&s;e the doctor is engaged in, is important and noble, the author readily acknow|ledges; and is not a little plea&s;ed, that a gentleman of his abilities and advantages has undertaken it. He certainly de&s;erves the thanks of his country, for what he has done in this matter. And doubtle&s;s has the thanks of all the true friends to the intere&s;t of religion; not excepting even tho&s;e of the church of England, who have impartiality and candor e|nough, to attend to the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The author is willing the world &s;hould know, that he wi&s;hes and prays, that an end may be put to the erecting of epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ions in New-England, in the manner it has been done for &s;o long a time; by which, he has not the lea&s;t doubt, not the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity, but directly the oppo&s;ite, has been greatly promoted. He &s;incerely wi&s;hes, the doc|tor may have the honor and happine&s;s, of being an in&s;trument of this; and would therefore be &s;or|ry to do any thing, that &s;hould tend to prevent it.</P>
<P>But if the doctor &s;hould appear to be wrong in one in&s;tance, this is no argument that he is &s;o in all others. And an attempt to &s;et him right, wherein he is thought to have made a mi&s;take, is an act of friend&s;hip to him. It is al&s;o, perhaps, worthy of remark, that the tenet in which the doc|tor is oppo&s;ed in the following enquiry, is exact|ly agreeable to mo&s;t, if not all of the epi&s;copal par|ty in New-England; &s;o that he herein falls in
<PB N="vii" REF="010007_0011_0F7B997462969D40">
with tho&s;e he oppo&s;es in the controver&s;y mention|ed. The author, therefore, in oppo&s;ing the doc|tor here, equally oppo&s;es tho&s;e whom he appears again&s;t. How then does he &s;trengthen them, and weaken the doctor's hands? May it not be truly &s;aid, that if the doctor &s;hould be convinced of his mi|&s;take in this in&s;tance, if it is one, and e&s;pou&s;e the contrary doctrine, he would be under better ad|vantages in this controver&s;y, than now he is? It is well known, what a noi&s;e mo&s;t of the doctor's antagoni&s;ts have made about his heterodoxy. If he had been quite orthodox, according to the faith of our pious forefathers in New-England, they would not have had this handle, however &s;incerely they now u&s;e it.</P>
<P>The author thinks the doctor worthy of e|&s;teem and honor, for his many excellent ta|lents; his clo&s;e application and diligence in his &s;tudy, his ea&s;y, happy, ma&s;terly way of expre&s;&s;|ing his &s;entiments, &amp;c. but all this is, in his view, rather a rea&s;on why the doctor &s;hould be corrected, if he errs in any important point. For &s;uch an error in <HI>him,</HI> will of cour&s;e be more hurt|ful and fatal to mankind, than in another. If his own conviction of his mi&s;take would have been a &s;ufficient remedy of this evil, application would have been made to him only; but as the ca&s;e &s;tands, a public confutation &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE doctor, without doubt, thought his argu|ments conclu&s;ive, and that he was doing &s;ervice to God and his church, in vindicating, in the be&s;t manner he could, what appeared to him important truth. And he may perhaps think, what is here offered to him and the public, is weak and incon|clu&s;ive.
<PB N="viii" REF="010007_0012_0F7B9975536C0008">
If &s;o, the author does not expect to be contemned or neglected; but that the doctor will be &s;o ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and good to the public, as fairly, and with chri&s;tian meekne&s;s to vindicate his &s;cheme, from the exceptions here taken, and &s;hew that they are indeed without foundation. If he &s;hould be convinced that he has made a mi|&s;take, it is concluded, from his known di&s;po&s;ition to be frank and open, that he will freely confe&s;s it. However that may be, the author, at pre&s;ent, re&s;ts in the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, and chearfully commits it to Him, who is able to plead it mo&s;t effectually, in His own way and time.</P>
<P>THE <HI>tenth</HI> &s;ection is more than was at fir&s;t de&s;ign|ed: but finding that what was &s;aid on the &s;ubject, would naturally lead to the que&s;tion there con&s;ider|ed; and it being an important one, and one about which there is perhaps more enquiry and di&s;pute now, than ever there has been before, tho' little or nothing has been publi&s;hed upon it; it was thought be&s;t not wholly to pa&s;s it in &s;ilence. The author is far from thinking the &s;ubject is exhau&s;t|ed, or that it may not be &s;et in a far more clear and convincing light. If any &s;erious readers, who have been in any degree of darkne&s;s and uncertainty with re&s;pect to this que&s;tion, &s;hall by what is there &s;aid get any light: and if the&s;e hints &s;hall be a help and excitement to any, who are making this the &s;ub|ject of their enquiry, to pur&s;ue the matter, &s;o as to throw greater light upon it, the utmo&s;t that is expected will be an&s;wered. If the author has made any dangerous mi&s;take on this head, and it &s;hall be pointed out by &s;ome wi&s;e, judicious pen, he will mo&s;t gladly &s;tand corrected before the world.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>THE text on which the doctor grounds his di&s;cour&s;e con&s;idered. His incon&s;i&s;tence with him&s;elf, in his way of explaining it, &s;hewn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE words the doctor has cho&s;en as the ground of his di&s;cour&s;e now under con&s;idera|tion, are tho&s;e of our Saviour, <Q>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate,</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 24.</NOTE> This text has been differently under&s;tood. Some &s;uppo&s;e that by the <HI>&s;trait gate</HI> is meant the entrance upon an holy life, or getting into the narrow way which leads to e|ternal life; which is the &s;ame that is commonly called conver&s;ion, or the new birth. And by &s;triving to enter in at this gate, they under&s;tand the exerci&s;es and endeavours of the unregenerate, which are antecedent to their conver&s;ion. But, few or none who under&s;tand the text thus, &s;uppo&s;e there is any certain connection between the &s;triv|ing here exhorted to, and &s;aving conver&s;ion, or that there is any promi&s;e made to this &s;triving.</P>
<P>Others &s;uppo&s;e that by the &s;trait gate our Savi|our means, in general, the entrance into heaven or eternal life.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr. Dedd. &amp; Poli Syn. On the text.</HI></NOTE> And then by &s;triving to enter in at this gate, is meant, a keeping the command|ments

of God, or the holy exerci&s;es of true &s;aints, by which they walk in the way to heaven; fight the fight of faith, and &s;o lay hold on eternal life. And in &s;upport of this la&s;t interpretation, and as an evidence that <HI>&s;triving</HI> in the text, does not mean the unholy exerci&s;es and endeavours of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are wholly under the dominion of &s;in; but the holy exerci&s;es and &s;trivings of the godly, it may be ob&s;erved, that the word in the original, tran&s;|lated <HI>&s;trive</HI> when u&s;ed in other places in the new te&s;tament, as it is often, always denotes the exer|ci&s;es and labor of true chri&s;tians in their way to heaven. And no good rea&s;on perhaps can be gi|ven, why it &s;hould not be under&s;tood in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e here. When St. Paul &s;ays to Timothy, "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eter|nal life," he &s;peaks to an eminently good man; and therefore it mu&s;t be under&s;tood as an exhorta|tion re&s;olutely to per&s;evere in a chri&s;tian cour&s;e. But the word in the original here tran&s;lated <HI>fight</HI> is the &s;ame u&s;ed by the evangeli&s;t in the text un|der con&s;ideration.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Agonizo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> ton kalon agona: Agonize the good agony.</HI> 4 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 12.</NOTE> The &s;ame words St. Paul u&s;es concerning him&s;elf, to denote the chri&s;ti|an cour&s;e he had gone through. "I have &s;ought the good fight." And he makes u&s;e of the &s;ame word, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, with reference to the exerci&s;es of true chri&s;tians, by which they go in the way to heaven. "And e|very one that <HI>&s;triveth</HI> for the ma&s;tery, is temper|rate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a cor|ruptible crown, but we an incorruptible." And he denotes his own exerci&s;es as a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="010007_0015_0F7B9976F3B58898">
by the &s;ame word. "Whereunto I al&s;o labor, <HI>&s;triving</HI> according to his workings which he work|eth in me mightily."</P>
<P>It may be noted here, that the word in the o|riginal in all the&s;e places, was mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed by the Greeks to denote the exerci&s;es and labor of tho&s;e, who were candidates for the prize &s;et up in the Olympic games: for in&s;tance, the vigorous exertion of tho&s;e who ran a race, in order to obtain the prize &s;et up for him who &s;hould out-run. And as the&s;e games in which they ran for the prize, &amp;c. were a fit emblem of the exerci&s;es of the chri|&s;tian life, it is frequently repre&s;ented by them: and hence the word u&s;ed for tho&s;e exerci&s;es, is applied to the chri&s;tiah, to &s;ignify the exerci&s;es and labor by which he &s;trives for eternal life. And the chri|&s;tian cour&s;e is called a race or <HI>agony,</HI> in allu&s;ion to the &s;ame thing.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> xiii. 1.&mdash;<HI>Let us run the</HI> race. <HI>In the original the</HI> agony. <HI>The race itself is callef the agony, the running is agonizing.</HI></NOTE> According to this, to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate of eternal life, or to a|gonize in order hereunto, is to agonize the good a|gony, &s;o as to lay hold on eternal life; to run the chri&s;tian race, the way of true holine&s;s, which is &s;et before us: And is the &s;ame which Chri&s;t exhorts to, when he &s;ays, "Enter ve in at the &s;trait gate."<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> vii. 14.</NOTE> But let it be ob&s;erved that the que&s;tion now in di&s;|pute does not turn upon the interpretation of this text; for let it be under&s;tood in either of the &s;en&s;es above-mentioned, it makes nothing for the doctor's promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate.

it, &s;triving to enter in, mu&s;t intend, a walking in the narrow way of holine&s;s; and then it &s;tands directly again&s;t him. This leads me to con&s;ider the doctor's interpretation.</P>
<P>By the &s;trait gate, the doctor under&s;tands the gate of heaven, or "the gate of eternal lite and happine&s;s."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 6, 7.</NOTE> But contrary to mo&s;t, if not all others, who &s;uppo&s;e this to be the meaning of the &s;trait gate, and in direct contradiction to him&s;elf, as will be &s;een pre&s;ently, he under&s;tlands <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter in at this gate, to mean the endeavours and doings of the unregenerate, who are wholly without all true holine&s;s. To the&s;e <HI>unholy</HI> exer|ci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate, he in&s;i&s;ts, the promi&s;es of regenerating grace and &s;alvation are made; and by the&s;e, he &s;uppo&s;es, however ab&s;urd|ly, they go in the way to heaven, and enter in thro' the gates into that holy city.</P>
<P>The doctor indeed &s;uppo&s;es, that the words may be con&s;idered as a precept given "both to tho&s;e who are, and who are not already in a regenerate &s;tate."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> If &s;o, then they are a command which enjoins both the unholy endeavours of the wicked, and the godly exerci&s;es of the true chri&s;tian. The doctor's argument for this is in the following words. <Q>For be they. in that happy e&s;tate or not, &s;till they ought to u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence to ob|tain the &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;pel; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</Q> It is true that all <HI>ought</HI> to enter in at the &s;trait gate (taking the gate in the doctor's &s;en&s;e of it) and in order to this, they <HI>ought</HI> to be real chri|&s;tians
<PB N="5" REF="010007_0017_0F7B99787047ECA0">
and to live an holy life. And in this view, the command to enter in at this gate is en|joined upon all, whether regenerate or not; as all are under indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations to &s;trive in this manner, in the exerci&s;e of true holine&s;s. If the precept to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, enjoins on chri&s;tians earne&s;tly to &s;eek eternal life in the way of true holine&s;s, or in keeping the com|mandments of God; then it enjoins the <HI>&s;ame</HI> on wicked men, and points out the <HI>very &s;ame</HI> way for them to obtain eternal life in, as for true &s;aints, and not <HI>another</HI> and quite different one; as it mu&s;t do, if it only requires of them tho&s;e doings which have nothing of the nature of true holine&s;s, and are therefore different in nature and kind from what the true chri&s;tian is directed to; they having no more likene&s;s, relation and connection, than god|line&s;s and ungodline&s;s. If, on the other hand, when wicked men are commanded to enter in at the &s;trait gate of eternal life, no more is intended than what they may do, and yet be unholy in heart and life; then no more is intended by the &s;ame command to the regenerate; for doubtle&s;s the command requires the &s;ame thing of one as of ano|ther: and if &s;o, they may enter into eternal life without any true holine&s;s; for the command to <HI>enter in,</HI> &s;urely requires all that is nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to enter in. But none, I tru&s;t, will a&s;&s;ert that the unholy and unclean can, while &s;uch, enter in through the gates into the heavenly city.</P>
<P>The doctor repeatedly &s;ays, there is <HI>but one</HI> way of life and &s;alvation; and challenges any one, who &s;hall &s;ay there are two, or more, to point them out, and &s;hew the difference there is betwixt them;
<PB N="6" REF="010007_0018_0F7B997A5ADC7700">
and yet that both are true and right, the ways of God's revealing.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 13, 14.</NOTE> It &s;eems the doctor him&s;elf is the man, who has found out <HI>two</HI> ways to life and &s;alvation, viz. the way of the unholy and un|clean, and the way of true virtue and holine&s;s, in which they go who turn their feet unto God's te|&s;timonies. But what's mo&s;t remarkable is, that he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that the&s;e two different ways are point|ed out and enjoined by one and the &s;ame com|mand. And now we mu&s;t wait on him to &s;hew the difference, and tell what the command enjoins on one, which it does not on the other.</P>
<P>BUT if We attend to the doctor's de&s;cription of &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate; we &s;hall find that it is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with its intending only the endeavours of the unregenerate (which it mu&s;t, if the words were to his purpo&s;e) but is al|&s;o not con&s;i&s;tent with their being at all intended or included in this &s;triving; it being, according to him, only applicable to the exerci&s;es and doings of real chri&s;tians. When the doctor was giving this de&s;cription, he &s;eems to have in a mea&s;ure forgot the point he chiefly contends for, and gives &s;uch an account of <HI>&s;triving,</HI> &amp;c. as is by no means com|patible to the unregenerate; and &s;o really incon&s;i&s;|tent with what he was about to prove. The read|er mu&s;t judge of the ju&s;tice of this remark, when he has attended to what follows.</P>
<P>To <HI>&s;trive</HI> to enter in at the &s;tralt gate, is, accord|ing to the doctor, to go in the narrow way which leadeth to life; and is oppo&s;ed to the broad way leading to de&s;truction. For he &s;ays, <Q>If we are not in the narrow way, we are of con&s;equence

<P>Further, the doctor &s;ays, <Q><HI>A dependance up|on Chri&s;t, as mediator between God and man,</HI> is implied in the very notion of &s;triving to obtain &s;alvation thro' him.</Q> And that it comprehends a <Q>relying, not on any &s;uppo&s;ed merit in what we do, <HI>but on the mercy of God in Chri&s;t,</HI> for ac|ceptance with him.</Q><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 20, 39, 40.</NOTE> Now, this is the ve|ry thing by which God's people, or true &s;aints are in &s;cripture di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others, as that in which true godline&s;s con&s;i&s;ts: and by it is evident|ly meant that FAITH, &s;aving, precious, holy faith of God's elect, which is peculiar to good men, and by which the ju&s;t do live.

<P>Another pa&s;&s;age of the doctor's is in the follow|ing words. <Q>Our Saviour, who certainly knew every thing relating to this affair, enjoins us to <HI>&s;trive</HI>; or, if the word may be allowed, <HI>to a|gonize,</HI> that we may enter into life: plainly im|porting that the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion is at once of &s;uch va&s;t importance, and attended with &s;uch difficulties, as to call for the mo&s;t anxious con|cern, the mo&s;t fixed re&s;olutions, and unwearied endeavours.

He has, at lea&s;t, &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted this here, however incon&s;i&s;tent with his main de&s;ign.

<P>He appears indeed not wholly unthoughtful of this matter: for upon a review of his de&s;cription of &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, he has the&s;e words, <Q>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, whether any unre|generate &s;inner can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trive <HI>in the manner repre&s;ented above</HI>?

<Q>That all who hear the go&s;pel, are <HI>required,</HI> not only to believe it, but to <HI>repent of their &s;ins,</HI> and to become the <HI>true di&s;ciples</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</Q><NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 66.</NOTE> If they are <HI>required</HI> to repent, &amp;c. then they may and ought to repent, and become <HI>true di&s;ciples</HI> of Chri&s;t; and therefore <HI>may and ought</HI> to &s;trive in the <HI>exerci&s;e of true repentance,</HI> and as real chri&s;tians. And if &s;o, then the que&s;tion, as the doctor has put it, comes to this: <HI>Whether, if unregenerate &s;inners become true penitents and real chri&s;tians, and as &s;uch, in the exerci&s;e of true faith and holine&s;s, &s;trive to obtain the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls, they are hereby intitled to a divine promi&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore, as the doctor has &s;tated it, is not di&s;puted by tho&s;e whom he means to op|po&s;e. For they all allow, that if unregenerate &s;in|ners, &s;trive as they may and ought to do, they &s;hall <HI>certainly</HI> obtain &s;alvation. But at the &s;ame time they may and ought to &s;trive in a right manner, i. e. as real penitents and true chri&s;tians: and the doctor is &s;o happy as to agree with them in this too. Where is the di&s;pute then? We can have none with him on this que&s;tion; for we hold the affir|mative as fully as he can. And now, Whether this is a "fair, ju&s;t and plain &s;tate of the important que&s;tion propo&s;ed," let the impartial judge. The doctor knew, or ought to have known, that they whom he meant to oppo&s;e, hold that no unregene|rate &s;inner &s;trives for &s;alvation as he may and ought to do: and if he had believed the contrary, he ought not to take it for granted, in &s;tating the que&s;|tion to be di&s;puted: for this, in&s;tead of putting
<PB N="16" REF="010007_0028_0F7B99840584E338">
the que&s;tion in a <HI>fair, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>plain light</HI> is real|ty <HI>begging the que&s;tion.</HI> But as he does not him&s;elf believe that unregenerate &s;inners ever &s;trive thus, but has affirmed they do not, this his &s;tate of the que&s;tion, is not only, not fair, or ju&s;t, but &s;ome what &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion really is, whether unregenerate &s;inners while they do nothing but what is con&s;i&s;t|ent with a &s;tate of unregeneracy, <HI>i. e.</HI> reigning wick|edne&s;s of heart, do ever &s;o &s;trive for &s;alvation, as tnat by their <HI>thus &s;triving,</HI> they are intitled to tho&s;e gracious promi&s;es, whereby God is engaged to be&s;tow eternal life upon them?</P>
<P>BUT let us &s;ee if the doctor has &s;ucceeded bet|ter in his <HI>&s;econd attempt.</HI> This is in the following words. <Q>Whether the gracious declarations and promi&s;es of God in his word, are &s;uch as will in any mea&s;ure admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that unregenerate &s;inners, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, may <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> &s;trive, and earne&s;tly en|deavour, in the u&s;e of proper means, to obtain the &s;alvation revealed therein, &s;eeking to God for his Grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and yet po&s;&s;ibly fall &s;hort of eternal life, and peri&s;h in their &s;ins, by rea&s;on that God withholds his &s;pirit and grace from them?</Q> He thinks, "the que&s;tion thus &s;tated, comes preci&s;ely to the &s;ame thing as in the former way." Perhaps it does. But if &s;o, then the matter is not mended; and the que&s;tion is &s;till far from being rightly &s;tated, as has been &s;hewn. All the difficulty in this &s;tate of the que&s;tion lies in the word DESIRE. If he u&s;es this word in the &s;en&s;e in which it is commonly u&s;ed, we &s;hall
<PB N="17" REF="010007_0029_0F7B998487DCCD58">
all agree with him and allow, that the gracious de|clarations and promi&s;es of God in his word, are &s;uch as will not admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they who <HI>de&s;ire the &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;pel,</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly fall &s;hort of eternal life. This therefore is not the que&s;tion in di&s;pute. The promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are beyond que&s;tion made to all who <HI>heartily de&s;ire</HI> the things promi&s;ed. But then we a&s;&s;ert that no unregenerate per&s;on does really and heartily de&s;ire the&s;e things. But of this more here|after.</P>
<P>The dodtor goes on to &s;ay, <Q>It may be reduc|ed to another form, and &s;till narrower compa&s;s thus, viz. Whether unregenerate &s;inners, under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, have <HI>any</HI> day of grace and &s;alvation afforded them; in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that they &s;hall certainly obtain eternal life, provided <HI>they heartily de&s;ire it,</HI> and &s;trive to that end.</Q> Still we are all agreed, none, I tru&s;t will deny this.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>He has expre&s;&s;ed the <HI>true point in que&s;tion,</HI> in the&s;e <HI>&s;everal ways,</HI> not meerly for the &s;ake of having it under&s;tood; but partly, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed, that the bare &s;tating it <HI>thus,</HI> would go a con&s;iderable ways towards a proper re&s;olution of it, with tho&s;e who are tolerably ac|quainted with the general tenor of the holy &s;crip|ture; unle&s;s their minds are unhappily prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in favor of &s;ome un&s;criptural &s;cheme of &s;y&s;tematical divinity.</Q> If he has indeed expre&s;&s;|ed the <HI>true point in que&s;tion,</HI> it appears to be ea&s;i|ly re&s;olved, from what has been ob&s;erved: For no body &s;eems to have any di&s;pute with him. But that he &s;hould imagine this to be the <HI>true point in
<PB N="18" REF="010007_0030_0F7B99854538B350">
que&s;tion</HI>; and that what he here fixes upon as the condition of the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, is ever come up to by unregenerate &s;inners, mu&s;t, I think, be owing to his not being tolerably acquainted with the general tenor of holy &s;cripture: unle&s;s perhaps his mind is unhappily prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favor of &s;ome <HI>un&s;criptural</HI> &s;cheme of <HI>UN&s;y&s;tematical</HI> di|vinity. But this will be more particularly con&s;ider|ed by and by.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the whole matter in di&s;pute is in the doctor's way of &s;tating the que&s;tion over|looked, or rather taken for granted; for if unregene|rate &s;inners ever actually do what he &s;uppo&s;es they mu&s;t do in order to have an intere&s;t in the promi&s;es, without que&s;tion promi&s;es of &s;alvation as made to their doings. But that unregenerate men ever do thus, lies on the doctor to prove, which he has not &s;o much as attempted any where; but as he has taken it for granted in &s;tating the que&s;tion, he has done &s;o thro' his whole performance, and from beginning to end, intirely mi&s;-&s;tated the matter, and really begged the whole que&s;tion in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I will now take leave to give what appears to me to be a fair, ju&s;t and plain &s;tate of this impor|tant que&s;tion before us.</P>
<P>QUEST. Are there any gracious promi&s;es of &s;alva|tion to the exerci&s;es and doings of unregenerate &s;in|ners, who do not &s;trive for &s;alvation as they ought to do; who have no true and hearty de&s;ires of the &s;al|vation offered in the go&s;pel; but are &s;o far from it, that they are under the reigning power of enmity a|gain&s;t God and the Saviour, and do with their whole heart oppo&s;e the way of &s;alvation opened in the
<PB N="19" REF="010007_0031_0F7B9985EFE91F18">
go&s;pel; and continually reject the &s;alvation it &s;elf, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to have any part therein, notwith&s;tanding it is freely offered to their choice and acceptance? The bare &s;tating the que&s;tion thus, I &s;uppo&s;e, will go a con&s;iderable ways to|wards a proper re&s;olution of it, even with all. The doctor him&s;elf, I pre&s;ume, will fully and chearfully e&s;pou&s;e the negative of this que&s;tion, thus &s;tated. But then he may perhaps complain, that the true point in que&s;tion is not expre&s;&s;ed, or at lea&s;t is not fairly &s;tated; becau&s;e the exerci&s;es and doings of unregenerate &s;inners are not ju&s;tly repre|&s;ented; and that is taken for granted in this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, which he &s;hall di&s;pute, and really is the only thing in que&s;tion. But would not &s;uch a complaint be really again&s;t him&s;elf, while the &s;ame objection lies again&s;t his own &s;tate of the que&s;tion? I &s;ay, the doctor has rai&s;ed the unregenerate man too high, and repre&s;ented him as doing mote than e|ver he does. On the other hand he &s;ays, I &s;ink him too low, and repre&s;ent all his exerci&s;es and doings in much too bad a light. Who does not &s;ee that I have as good a right to take for granted what I a&s;&s;ert of the doings of the unregenerate man, as he has, what he has a&s;&s;erted? All mu&s;t &s;ee, I think, by this time, that in order to under&s;tand and &s;ettle the que&s;tion before us, it mu&s;t be fir&s;t deter|mined, what can be ju&s;tly predicated of the doings of unregenerate &s;inners: and that a ju&s;t re&s;olution of this will put an end to the di&s;pute. If it can be proved that the doctor's unregenerate &s;inner is a creature only of his own fancy; a kind of mon|&s;ter; an enemy to God, dre&s;&s;ed up in the attire of a &s;aint, a contradiction almo&s;t in terms: then all he

has &s;aid, and attempted to prove of &s;uch an one, is really nothing to the purpo&s;e. Here then we mu&s;t join i&s;&s;ue, and leave it to the world to judge, who, is on the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>

<P>THE doctor often &s;peaks of &s;inners <HI>de&s;iring &s;alvation.</HI> With relation to this, he u&s;es the word DESIRE above thirty times in this argu|ment. He calls it a <HI>&s;incere</HI> de&s;ire, a <HI>real</HI> and a <HI>hearty</HI> de&s;ire. This is a word of great importance with him. According to him, they who do not heartily and earne&s;tly <HI>de&s;ire</HI> &s;alvation, do not &s;trive for it &s;o as to obtain, and &s;o are not in the way to it.<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 12.</NOTE> And on the other hand, he often &s;peaks of this <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of &s;alvation, as that which will not, can|not fail of &s;ucce&s;s: as if it was the only nece&s;&s;ary condition on the &s;inner's part, to which all the promi&s;es in the go&s;pel are made. And mo&s;t of his arguments derive all their force and &s;trength from this word. 'Tis proper therefore in the fir&s;t place
<PB N="21" REF="010007_0033_0F7B998922F50D08">
particularly to attend to this, and enter into the true meaning of it; otherwi&s;e we may di&s;pute al|together in the dark.</P>
<P>Since the doctor makes &s;o much of this word, and &s;peaks &s;o often of an <HI>hearty de&s;ire of &s;alvation,</HI> and builds &s;o much upon it; it might have been expected that he would have given &s;uch a plain de|finition of this phra&s;e, and &s;o explained the matter, that none could be left at a lo&s;s about his meaning. But this he has not done; we mu&s;t therefore find out his meaning as well as we can, by con&s;idering the various pa&s;&s;ages in which he u&s;es the&s;e words, together with what they are connected. It is plain at fir&s;t view, that he means to &s;peak of the <HI>de&s;ires</HI> of unregenerate per&s;ons; but the que&s;tion is, whe|ther he means only tho&s;e de&s;ires of &s;alvation, which are indeed compatible to an unregenerate man; or &s;omething which is never found with &s;uch, how|ever he may &s;uppo&s;e it; but is peculiar to the re|generate?</P>
<P>By de&s;iring &s;alvation, or eternal life, he evident|ly means the &s;ame with <HI>choo&s;ing</HI> it, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which the people of I&s;rael were exhort|ed to <HI>choo&s;e life.</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> xxx 19. <HI>See p</HI> 53, 54.</NOTE> The doctor &s;peaking of that pa&s;&s;age ob&s;erves, that life was &s;et before them "for their choice" and then has the following words, <Q>And if &s;o, the obtaining it <HI>depended on their choice,</HI> or was connected therewith. And doubt|le&s;s, it is not le&s;s truly and properly &s;et before &s;inners now, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, than it was before the I&s;raelits in the time of Mo&s;es. From whence we may conclude, that if we <HI>re|ally

de&s;ire,</HI> and &s;trive to enter into life, we &s;hall not fall &s;hort of it.</Q><NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 54.</NOTE> And in another pa&s;|&s;age he repre&s;ents this <HI>real de&s;ire</HI> of &s;alvation as be|ing the &s;ame with <HI>accepting of it,</HI> and <HI>coming to Chri&s;t</HI> for it, or at lea&s;t as implying this.<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 55, 56.</NOTE> Hav|ing ob&s;erved that "the &s;criptures &s;peak plainly and directly of &s;inners neglecting the opportunity allowed them for obtaining life, as the real cau&s;e, of their death or de&s;truction," he proceeds to il|lu&s;trate this by various pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, &s;uch as, "how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation? Ye <HI>will not</HI> come unto me, that ye might have life. O Jeru&s;alem&mdash;how often would I have gathered thy children&mdash;and ye <HI>would</HI> not, &amp;c." And then &s;ays, <Q>The&s;e, with innumerable other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, mo&s;t clearly and &s;trongly expre&s;s this &s;entiment; That the true and only rea&s;on why &s;inners peri&s;h, is,&mdash;that they <HI>neglect</HI> the great &s;alvation offered to them; and <HI>will not</HI> come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for life. But neither of the&s;e things can be truly and proper|ly &s;aid of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, as <HI>really to de&s;ire</HI> the &s;alvation revealed, and to &s;trive in order there|to.</Q> From the&s;e, and other pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame import, I think it plainly appears, that by a <HI>real de&s;ire of &s;alvation,</HI> he means a hearty choice of life, a true acceptance of &s;alvation, and coming to Chri&s;t for life, or a taking and accepting of the good things freely offered in the go&s;pel. He has therefore &s;et him&s;elf an ea&s;y ta&s;k, while he under|takes to prove, that they who thus de&s;ire &s;alvation,

<P>UNREGENERATE &s;inners may, while they conti|nue &s;uch, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e de&s;ire &s;alvation.

Such a de&s;ire as this every per&s;on under the go&s;pel has, in &s;ome degree, who has any belief of the truth of divine revelation: And the&s;e de&s;ires are &s;trong, and influence the conduct of men, in proportion to their attention to the&s;e things, and their apprehention and &s;en&s;e of the importance of them to them&s;elves. But this is con&s;i&s;tent with their hating the true cha|racter of the only Saviour, and the &s;alvation which
<PB N="25" REF="010007_0037_0F7C229F1A80DDC8">
he offers freely for their acceptance; and their continuing to reject it with their whole hearts. It is but to delude &s;inners, to repre&s;ent to them, that their concern and de&s;ires of this kind, are the lea&s;t evidence that their hearts are a whit the nearer a true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t, or a real acceptance of &s;al|vation as offered by him; or that there is the le&s;s oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel in their hearts. If the doc|tor, by his DESIRES of &s;alvation, means &s;uch de|&s;ires as the&s;e, which mo&s;t men under the go&s;pel have in a greater or le&s;s degree, and had explained him|&s;elf, mo&s;t of his arguments would appear in their true weakne&s;s, to every one at fir&s;t view. But the&s;e are not truely and properly de&s;ires of the &s;al|vation offered in the go&s;pel, according to the mo&s;t common and natural meaning of the word: becau&s;e that &s;alvation is not properly the object of the&s;e de|&s;ires, but &s;omething el&s;e; yea, &s;alvation as it is of|fered is not de&s;ired, but rejected.

<P>The &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;pel, is offered freely to the acceptance of all; the proclamation is, "Who&s;oever <HI>will,</HI> let him come and take it."

But as it is evident from what has been taken notice of al|ready, that he, at lea&s;t &s;ome times, means &s;ome|thing el&s;e by his de&s;ires of &s;alvation, I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>Men may mo&s;t properly be &s;aid really and hear|tily to de&s;ire &s;alvation, when the &s;alvation it&s;elf is the object of their de&s;ires, the good things in which it con&s;i&s;ts being what they are plea&s;ed with, and choo&s;e for their own &s;ake; and this implies an hearty approbation of the character of the Saviour,
<PB N="27" REF="010007_0039_0F7B998D2A9CAD18">
and the way of &s;alvation by him. They who have &s;uch a de&s;ire of &s;alvation as this do truely choo&s;e life, and may properly be &s;aid to accept of &s;alvati|on; to <HI>receive</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t and come to him for life, or believe on his name. The doctor &s;eems to mean &s;uch kind of de&s;ires as the&s;e, by the de|&s;ires of &s;alvation he &s;peaks &s;o much of, as has been &s;hewn. It is quoted, as has been before ob&s;erv|ed, that to &s;uch de&s;ires as the&s;e the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are made; therefore they who thus de&s;ire &s;alvation &s;hall not fail of it. But &s;uch de&s;ires as the&s;e are holy de&s;ires; and therefore are found no where but in a regenerate heart. The love of ho|line&s;s is it &s;elf an exerci&s;e of holine&s;s: but an hear|ty de&s;ire of holine&s;s for its own &s;ake, implies and is indeed it&s;elf, an exerci&s;e of love to holine&s;s. Now to de&s;ire &s;alvation for its own &s;ake, becau&s;e 'tis what it is, is to de&s;ire holine&s;s for its own &s;ake: for holine&s;s comes into the very e&s;&s;ence of this &s;al|vation. And that approbation of the character of the Saviour, which is implied in true de&s;ires of &s;alvation by him, al&s;o implies love to him, and con&s;equently is an exerci&s;e of love to holine&s;s: for holine&s;s is an e&s;&s;ential, and the mo&s;t important part of the character of the Saviour, without which he could not be the Saviour of &s;inners.</P>
<P>The &s;alvation which the go&s;pel reveals, the way in which it is be&s;towed, and the Saviour him&s;elf, are if I may &s;o &s;peak, &s;o cloathed with holine&s;s, and &s;uch a bright expre&s;&s;ion of it, which is the pe|culiar excellency and glory of the go&s;pel, that the unholy are &s;et at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the&s;e things; and men never will de&s;ire and choo&s;e them untill they have a heart friendly to holine&s;s, which is
<PB N="28" REF="010007_0040_0F7B998D6EA10EB8">
the <HI>new heart</HI> given in regeneration. If the unre|generate have an heart to de&s;ire and choo&s;e the &s;al|vation offered in the go&s;pel, in the &s;en&s;e now ex|plained, it will be difficult to &s;hew what need they &s;tand in of regeneration in order to be &s;aved, or to tell what regeneration con&s;i&s;ts in. For if men have an heart to de&s;ire and choo&s;e holine&s;s for holine&s;s &s;ake, and &s;o to delight in it, as they mu&s;t, in or|der to de&s;ire and choo&s;e the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel, and come to Chri&s;t, they have no need of a <HI>new heart</HI> in order to be holy, and happy in God and the Saviour: this &s;ame principle from whence &s;uch de&s;ires flow being perfected, they will be per|fectly united to the Saviour, and compleatly deliver|ed from &s;in and mi&s;ery, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;al|vation. The need men &s;tand in therefore of being regenerated, or of having a new heart given them, is a demon&s;tration that the unregenerate have no &s;uch de&s;ires.</P>
<P>And this is agreeable to the whole current of &s;cripture repre&s;entation, as might be ea&s;ily &s;hewn, was there need of it. The &s;cripture ranks all man|kind in two cla&s;&s;es. Tho&s;e that love God and his ways, who know and choo&s;e the things that are excellent; and tho&s;e the language of who&s;e hearts to God is, "depart from us, for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways;" who are enemies to the ju&s;t God and Saviour, and neglect and refu&s;e the &s;alvation offered. Of the&s;e, &s;ome may be more concerned about them&s;elves than others, and &s;o have more exerci&s;es, and take more pains to e&s;cape eternal mi&s;ery; but &s;till their hearts are as oppo&s;ite to reconciliation with God, and to the &s;alvation offered as ever; they have &s;till an heart of &s;tone,

a &s;tubborn rebellious heart, and are dead in te&s;pa&s;|&s;es and &s;ins, untill they have a new heart given them, and they are quickened by regeneration.</P>
<P>If the doctor will &s;hew from &s;cripture, that there are &s;ome per&s;ons who are neither dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, nor alive to God; who are neither enemies to God and the Saviour, nor his friends and reconciled to him: or if he will tell what need they &s;tand in of regeneration, who have the&s;e hearty de&s;ires of &s;alvation, which are incon&s;i&s;tent with a hard heart, a neglecting the great &s;alvation offered them, and a refu&s;ing to come to Chri&s;t for life, and will plainly &s;hew what &s;uch a regenera|tion con&s;i&s;ts in, he will doubtle&s;s greatly oblige the chri&s;tian world. But till this is done, we mu&s;t take leave to conclude, that the de&s;ires of the un|regenerate he &s;peaks of, and the regeneration of tho&s;e who fir&s;t have the&s;e de&s;ires, are a figment of his own.</P>

<P>WHAT the doctor, undertakes to &s;upport is, that the endeavours and &s;triving of the <HI>un|regenerate</HI> hare a promi&s;e of &s;ucce&s;fs; and &s;o are

It appears at fir&s;t view they are not wanting in number: the weight and &s;trength of them is now to be inquired into.

But that this may clearly appear, we will briefly con&s;ider each of them.</P>
<P>ARG. 1&s;t <Q>Mankind being con&s;idered in &s;crip|ture as in a &s;tate of &s;in and death, it is declared that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave them: to <HI>&s;ave &s;inners</HI>; to <HI>&s;eck and</HI> to <HI>&s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI></Q><NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 47.</NOTE> The doctor, proceeds, to illu&s;trate this by &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and then adds, <Q>Now, from &s;uch declarations of holy &s;cripture, we may fairly infer that all tho&s;e to whom the go&s;pel is preached, have therein an offer of &s;alvation made to them. And if it re|ally makes an offer, or points out a method of &s;alvation to all; can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any &s;inner WHO IS WILLING AND DESIR|OUS, and &s;trives, to obtain the &s;alvation thus revealed, &s;hould yet be rejected of God and finally peri&s;h? Certainly it cannot.</Q><NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P,</HI> 48, 49.</NOTE> The

whole of this is granted. But what does it prove? that &s;alvation is offered to the acceptance of all: and therefore whoever is &s;o "de&s;irous" to obtain the &s;alvation thus revealed as to "be willing," to have it, and heartily accept of it, &s;hall not be rejected. No|thing can be more certain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> But what is this to an unregenerate &s;inner who <HI>will not</HI> come to Chri&s;t for life, and continues to make light of, and reject, the &s;alvation offered to him?</P>

or in &s;uch a &s;tate as renders repentance <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for them; manife&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es, that God <HI>wills them to peri&s;h,</HI> that he <HI>would not</HI> have them come to repentance; nor really allows them a &s;pace for it in any proper &s;en&s;e: and &s;o is directly contrary to the doctrine of &s;cripture.</Q> All may be &s;aved who truly de&s;ire it, and repentance is im|po&s;&s;ible to none who are willing to repent. But if the unregenerate, do always refu&s;e to repent, there being no difficulty in the way of their repentance and &s;alvation, but the ob&s;tinacy of their own will, what is all this to the doctors purpo&s;e? In this pa&s;&s;age the doctor fully &s;hews that by de&s;iring &s;al|vation, he intends the &s;inners good will in the ca&s;e; and &s;uppo&s;es that the unregenerate may be &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed towards repentance and &s;alvation as that if they peri&s;h, it mu&s;t be owing, not to any deficien|cy in their hearts but to &s;ome fatal difficulty which God has laid in their way which it is impo&s;&s;ible their good will &s;hould remove.

<P>ARG. 4th. <Q>It is further to be remarked, that during this &s;pace given for repentance, or that day of &s;alvation, which the &s;criptures &s;o plainly a&s;&s;ert: &s;inners are earne&s;tly admoni&s;hed, ex|horted and commanded, to &s;eek God, to be re|conciled to him, and to work out their &s;alvati|on.</Q><NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 51.</NOTE> And having produced a number of pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e, he draws the con&s;equence in

the following words. <Q>The&s;e exhortations and commands, are directed more e&s;pecially to &s;in|ners; to the <HI>wicked</HI>; to <HI>&s;imple ones, &s;corn|ers</HI> and <HI>fools</HI>; to &s;uch as were not yet <HI>reconciled, to God.</HI> And can any unprejudiced man think it con&s;i&s;tent with them, to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;inners may be awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery in being in a &s;tate of alienation from God, as to <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to be reconciled to him, and really &s;trive to obtain a part in the &s;alvation thus revealed; and yet fail of it! Judge for your&s;elves</Q>&mdash;We will&mdash;And therefore conclude, that the&s;e exhorta|tions and commands being given to the wicked, &s;corners, and fools, &amp;c. who are the &s;ame with the unregenerate, is no argument that they require nothing but what &s;uch may comply with, and yet remain wicked, &s;corners, and fools; but they are required to <HI>leave off &s;corning</HI>; to <HI>for&s;ake the fool|i&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>ARG. 5th. <Q>Conformably hereto, life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing, are &s;aid to be &s;et before &s;inners, in the word of God, and they are admoni&s;hed to <HI>choo&s;e</HI> life.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 19.</NOTE>&mdash;But with what truth or propriety could life and death be &s;aid to be &s;et before &s;inners, if tho' they <HI>de&s;ired life,</HI> and heartily endeavoured to obtain it, they might

<P>ARG. 6th. <Q>The &s;cripture &s;peaks of &s;ome &s;in|ners as wholly left, and for&s;aken of God, in this world; given up to their own hearts lufts, to incurable blindne&s;s, to &s;trong delu&s;ion, &amp;c. that they <HI>might be damned.</HI> Now if there is any &s;uch thing as &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ges of &s;cripture &s;eem to a&s;&s;ert; and as they are u&s;ually under|&s;tood; it will even from hence follow, that the per&s;ons thus given up of God, were, antecedent|ly hereto, in a &s;alvable &s;tate; that they had in &s;ome mea&s;ure the re&s;traints and &s;trivings of God's &s;pirit; that they were really put into a capacity for obtaining &s;alvation, HAD THEY DESIR|EDIT; and that <HI>their not doing &s;o,</HI> was the rea&s;on of their being thus for&s;aken.</Q><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 54.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve upon all this, that there is no advance made by this argument, it being the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with the foregoing, only in a little differ|ent words. All that the doctor attempts to prove here is, that if the &s;inner under the go&s;pel is not &s;aved, but is given up to ruin, it is becau&s;e he does not de&s;ire and choo&s;e &s;alvation when offered to him, but neglects and refu&s;es it. But how does this help the unregenerate, who always do this?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="010007_0048_0F7B9995B1BC9310">ARG. 7th. <Q>The &s;criptures &s;peak plainly and directly of &s;inners neglecting the opportunity allowed them for obtaining life, as the real cau&s;e of their death or de&s;truction.</Q> Hence he inferrs in allu&s;ion to the &s;criptures he here quotes, <Q>That the true and only rea&s;on why &s;inners pe|ri&s;h, is, that they do not <HI>regard</HI> the hand of God, &s;tretched out to &s;ave them; that they grieve him by their obduracy in &s;in; that they <HI>neglect</HI> the great &s;alvation offered to them; and <HI>will not come</HI> to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for life.</Q> But <Q>neither of the&s;e things can be truely and proper|ly &s;aid of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, as <HI>really to de&s;ire</HI> the &s;al|vation revealed; and to &s;trive in order thereto; even tho' they are not (which is very &s;uppo&s;e|able) already in a regenerate &s;tate.

In this &s;en&s;e it is made po&s;&s;ible to all; and their con&s;tant|ly neglecting and refu&s;ing to de&s;ire and endeavour to become partakers of it, does not alter the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to this, If therefore they mi&s;s of this &s;alvation, becau&s;e <HI>they do not de&s;ire it,</HI> but ne|glect and refu&s;e it, which is true of all unregene|rate men; then this is very con&s;i&s;tent with their falling under "an aggravated condemnation," becau&s;e they "do not actually comply with the method of &s;alvation revealed."</P>
<P>NINE of the doctors fourteen arguments have now been con&s;idered. And as they are all built upon one hypothe&s;is, which has no truth in it, the fal&s;ehood of that being detected, they appear to be perfectly weak and inconclu&s;ive.</P>

<P>The doctor attempts to prove that the conditi|on to which the&s;e promi&s;es of &s;piritual, &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings are made, intends the exerci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate. His arguments for this are now carefully to be enquired into.</P>
<P>He having ob&s;erved, that <Q>it will perhaps be &s;aid, that none but a regenerate man, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>turn at God's, or wi&s;dom's reproof,</HI> or to <HI>wait at the po&s;ts of her doors,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e here intended,</Q> goes on to &s;ay, <Q>But this were an arbitrary a&s;&s;ertion: one for which there is not the lea&s;t colour or foundation. For the per|&s;ons here addre&s;&s;ed, are &s;poken to under the character of <HI>&s;imple ones, &s;corners,</HI> and <HI>fools</HI>; who certainly need wi&s;dom the mo&s;t of any. And the promi&s;e is apparently made for the encou|ragement of &s;uch, to turn at her reproof, and to watch daily at her gates; that they might find her, and thereby <HI>find life.</HI> This was there|fore to be done by them, <HI>antecedently</HI> to their obtaining &s;piritual wi&s;dom; <HI>not in the actual exerci&s;e of it.</HI></Q><NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 57, 58.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="010007_0053_0F7B999BC1892870">The per&s;ons here addre&s;&s;ed are indeed "&s;imple ones, &s;corners and fools, who certainly need wi&s;|dom the mo&s;t of any." But does it hence follow, that they are not called upon and required to o|bey and be <HI>wi&s;e</HI>; but to do &s;omething while they remain &s;corners and fools, or antecedent to their obtaining wi&s;dom? I think not: But directly the contrary: <HI>viz.</HI> that they are required to em|brace wi&s;dom, or be wi&s;e; to cea&s;e from &s;corning, and become obedient: to for&s;ake the fooli&s;h, and live. I tru&s;t the doctor will not deny that <HI>turning</HI> at wi&s;dom's reproof implies thus much. And if &s;o, it cannot mean any thing to be done by them while they continue fools and &s;corners, or con&s;i&s;t|ent with their continuing &s;uch. It appears to me an odd way of arguing, to &s;ay, that &s;eeing they are addre&s;&s;ed in the character of &s;imple ones, &s;corn|ers, and fools, therefore they are called upon to act according to this character; that is, like &s;imple ones, &s;corners, and fools. But thus argues the doctor.</P>
<P>And this is not the only in&s;tance of the doctor's arguing at this rate. In order to prove that the <HI>a&s;king, &s;eeking,</HI> and <HI>knocking</HI> our Saviour &s;peaks of, intends the de&s;ires, prayers and endeavours of the unregenerate, he &s;ays, "The words were &s;poken by him to the promi&s;cuous multitude of his profe&s;&s;|ed followers; and there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that all the&s;e were in a regenerate &s;tate."<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 62.</NOTE> This is as if a doctor of divinity &s;hould gravely under|take to prove that the moral law, contained in the ten commands requires nothing but what unholy,

wicked men do, while &s;uch; becau&s;e it was pub|li&s;hed to a promi&s;cuous multitude, many, if not mo&s;t, of whom were &s;uch. The doctor allows, that <Q>all tho&s;e in general who hear the go&s;pel, are <HI>invited</HI> and <HI>required</HI> to <HI>repent of their &s;ins,</HI> and to become the <HI>true di&s;ciples</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="(&s;)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 66.</NOTE> He repre&s;ents tho&s;e who will not allow this, to be "men of a di&s;ordered mind, hardly fit to be rea&s;oned with." If the doctor will not rank him&s;elf among the&s;e, he mu&s;t allow that our Saviour, when he preached the go&s;pel on the mount, did invite and require all his hearers to repent and become his <HI>true di&s;ciples,</HI> and as &s;uch, with a peni|tent, humble, chri&s;tian temper of mind, to a&s;k, &s;eek and knock; however far he knew mo&s;t of them then to be from &s;uch a temper. But this is to give up the argument under con&s;ideration, as fit to be u&s;ed only by "men of a di&s;ordered mind, hardly fit to be rea&s;oned with." But to return,</P>
<P>The doctor goes on to argue, that if the pro|mi&s;e of wi&s;dom in the texts quoted, is not "made to the turning, waiting and watching of an unre|generate man," then it amounts to no more than this; that upon their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> becoming wi&s;e, they &s;hall <HI>then</HI> have wi&s;dom given them. But &s;uch a pro|mi&s;e, he thinks, not "agreeable to the wi&s;dom of God."<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 62.</NOTE></P>
<P>This, with his words ju&s;t now quoted relating to the&s;e &s;criptures, leads to the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. It does not appear that there is any promi&s;e of wi&s;dom in the&s;e texts, of which they have no degree, who hearken and turn at wi&s;dom's reproof.
<PB N="43" REF="010007_0055_0F7B999D3B7FEF00">
The thing required here is wi&s;dom. They are exhorted to act directly contrary to what &s;corners and fools do, which &s;urely is to act wi&s;ely. "Hear in&s;truction, and <HI>be wi&s;e,</HI> and refu&s;e it not. Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that <HI>heareth me,</HI> watching daily at my gates, &amp;c." Hearing in&s;truction is here &s;poken of as the &s;ame with being wi&s;e, or as that in which wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts; and not as &s;omething which a fool mu&s;t do, as &s;uch, or while he continues a fool, and antecedent to his exerci&s;ing any wi&s;dom. Therefore &s;uch are pronounced ble&s;&s;ed who hear|ken to wi&s;dom, watching daily at her gates, &amp;c. which is it&s;elf an exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom, We have the &s;ame exhortation in a little different words, in the context.<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> viii 5.</NOTE> "O ye &s;imple, <HI>under&s;tand wi&s;dom</HI>: and, ye fools, <HI>be ye of an under&s;tanding heart.</HI>" None can &s;uppo&s;e that what is required here, is &s;omething to be done by the &s;imple and fools, "an|tecedently to their obtaining wi&s;dom;" but they are called upon to be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is evident with re&s;pect to the other pa&s;&s;age referred to by the doctor, "How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? And the &s;cor|ners delight in their &s;corning, and fools hate know|ledge? Turn you at my reproof." Here 'tis &s;up|po&s;ed that they mu&s;t cea&s;e from loving &s;implicity, and no longer delight in &s;corning, and hate know|ledge, in order to turn at wi&s;dom's reproof; or rather, that this is implied in the turning required. Therefore turning is an exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom and o|bedience, in oppo&s;ition to folly and &s;tubborne&s;s. How the doctor could imagine that, here, and in
<PB N="44" REF="010007_0056_0F7B999E091053E8">
the words before con&s;idered, wi&s;dom is promi&s;ed, upon doing &s;omething in which no wi&s;dom is im|plied, I am at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>It is indeed here promi&s;ed, that upon their <HI>turn|ing,</HI> wi&s;dom will <HI>make known her words unto them.</HI> But this only intends that they &s;hall be taken into the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, in con&s;equence of their be|ing &s;o wi&s;e as to embrace her; and &s;hall be train|ed up by her, as the children of wi&s;dom, to great|er degrees of knowledge and under&s;tanding. For "the Lord layeth up &s;ound wi&s;dom for the <HI>righ|teous.</HI>"<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> ii. 7.</NOTE> "To him that <HI>hath</HI> &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more abundance." Give in&s;truction to a <HI>wi&s;e man,</HI> and he will be yet wi&s;er: teach a ju&s;t man, and he will increa&s;e in learning."<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> ix. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>This leads to another remark,</P>
<P N="2">2. It is contrary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e; Yea, a plain contradiction, to &s;uppo&s;e that any per&s;on does hearken to the reproofs and in&s;truction of wi&s;dom, and obey her dictates, while a fool, and antecedent to his having and exerci&s;ing any wi&s;dom. To hearken to wi&s;dom, and turn at her reproof, is &s;urely it&s;elf <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> or an in&s;tance and exerci&s;e of wi&s;|dom. If the dictates of wi&s;dom it&s;elf are wi&s;e; then it is not folly, but wi&s;dom, to hearken to them. If this is not wi&s;dom, it will be difficult to &s;hew what is wi&s;dom, or that there is any &s;uch thing in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>The doctor concludes this argument by &s;aying, <Q>I may venture to appeal to any wi&s;e man, whe|ther &s;uch a promi&s;e would be agreeable to the wi&s;dom of God.</Q><NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 58.</NOTE> I will venture my charac|ter
<PB N="45" REF="010007_0057_0F7B999EC8B4E1C0">
for wi&s;dom, with the public, and with the doctor him&s;elf, &s;o far as to &s;ay, that whatever promi&s;e is made to hearkening to wi&s;dom, and turning at her repoof, is a promi&s;e made to a <HI>wi&s;e act</HI> or the exerci&s;e of wi&s;dom; and that &s;uch a promi&s;e may be agreeable to the wi&s;dom of God. And I hope the doctor will, for time to come, be &s;o <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> and &s;o much of a divine and philo&s;opher, as not to a&s;&s;ert, or even think the contrary.</P>
<P>I COME now to con&s;ider the doctors arguments to prove that <HI>hungering and thir&s;ting after righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> intends the exerci&s;es of the unregenerate. He &s;ays, <Q><HI>there is not the lea&s;t ground to doubt</HI> but that convinced, awakened &s;inners, may and do often, thus hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 60.</NOTE></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Hungering and thir&s;ting &s;uppo&s;es and implies, yea con&s;i&s;ts in a reli&s;h of, and appetite to, the things hungered and thir&s;ted after. So far therefore as &s;inners are without any real, true ap|petite to holine&s;s or righteou&s;ne&s;s, and have no re|li&s;h and love for it, But an aver&s;ion to it; ju&s;t &s;o far there is <HI>ground to doubt,</HI> whether they hunger and thir&s;t after it: Yea, there is ground of <HI>a&s;&s;u|rance</HI> that they do not. But the unregenerate have no &s;uch appetite; for their unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts in the want of it, and the perfect prevalence and do|minion of and inclination and appetite directly con|trary hereto. Therefore, whatever el&s;e they may hunger and thir&s;t after, they do not hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="010007_0058_0F7B999F9399DA50">Be&s;ides, if the&s;e words of our Saviour are con&s;i|dered in their connection, it will appear unrea&s;on|able to apply them to the unregencrate. Hunger|ing and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, is &s;poken of as an abiding, con&s;tant exerci&s;e, and points out a character, as much as any of the re&s;t of the&s;e bea|titudes; &s;uch as the <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> the <HI>merciful,</HI> the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> &amp;c. The doctor I conclude, will not &s;uppo&s;e that the other exerci&s;es or characters mentioned here, intend the tran&s;ient acts of the unregenerate; but the abiding exerci&s;es and cha|racter of true chri&s;tians, which are peculiar and e&s;|&s;ential to them as &s;uch. And there is no rea&s;on why this <HI>one</HI> expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;ingled out, as belonging to the unregencrate only; and not to tho&s;e, who&s;e temper and exerci&s;es Chri&s;t is cha|racterizing thro' this whole pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this the doctor argues in the follow|ing words, <Q>If any &s;hould &s;ay that the regene|rate only, or &s;uch as have already attained unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; this were altogether as contrary to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, as to &s;ay, that a man mu&s;t eat a good meal, in order to be hungry in a literal &s;en&s;e; and that he mu&s;t drink an hearty draught, in order to be a-thir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The mi&s;-repre&s;entation and ab&s;urdity contained in the&s;e words mu&s;t appear, I think, to all who I will calmly attend to the matter. Regeneration; does not con&s;i&s;t in any exerci&s;e of the mind, or any enjoyment: but by being regenerated a foun|dation is laid in the mind for holy exerci&s;es, for hungering and thir&s;ting after rightcoune&s;s, and eating and drinkirg in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, In rege|neration
<PB N="47" REF="010007_0059_0F7B99A0444C1CE8">
is given what may be called an appetite to holine&s;s or a right ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition. And the exerci&s;es of this new ta&s;te or appetite, in which the mind hungers and thir&s;ts, eats and drinks, and en|joys &s;piritual objects, follow regeneration, and are the effect of it. The regenerate therefore have not "attained unto righteou&s;ne&s;s," or active holine&s;s, neither have they eat and drank &s;o as to be &s;ati&s;|fied, until the appetite given in regeneration is ex|erci&s;ed in hungering and thir&s;ting after holine&s;s: which appetite, thus exerci&s;ed, is always gratifi|ed in the enjoyment of the object towards which is exerci&s;ed. And thus the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t is always fulfilled: For men never are filled or &s;a|tisfied, but in the exerci&s;e of holine&s;s; that is, in loving and delighting in divine things, or in hun|gering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s. But in this way, they never fail of being &s;atisfied or filled. The doctor therefore wholly mi&s;-repre&s;ents the matter. If he had put the ca&s;e properly, and ac|cording to truth, it would &s;tand thus. "If any &s;hould &s;ay, that the regenerate only can be &s;up|po&s;ed to hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; this were altogether as contrary to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, as to &s;ay, that a man mu&s;t" <HI>have a &s;tomach prepar|ed, or an appetite to reli&s;h food and drink, in order to his hungering after, or de&s;iring, them.</HI> But that this is <HI>perfectly agreeable</HI> to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, I tru&s;t, will not be di&s;puted by any one, who has the lea&s;t degree of either. And it may be there|fore added, that to &s;uppo&s;e that the unregenerate do ever hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the hungry man de&s;ires food, or the thir&s;ty, drink, is altogether as contrary to all rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="48" REF="010007_0060_0F7B99A0F4D81380">
as to &s;ay, that a man wholly de&s;titute of any ap|petite to food and drink, or with a perfect antipa|thy again&s;t them, is hungery and thir&s;ty in a literal &s;en&s;e, and earne&s;tly longs for them.</P>
<P>The doctor goes on to &s;ay, <Q>This benediction and promi&s;e, more e&s;pecially re&s;pect unregene|rate, heavy laden &s;inners: as do al&s;o &s;uch gra|cious invitations and promi&s;es as the&s;e&mdash;<HI>Ho, e|very one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters&mdash;Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good.</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lv, 1, 2</NOTE> <HI>Who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iv. 14</NOTE> <HI>I am the bread of life, he that cometheth unto me &s;hall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> vi. 35.</NOTE> <HI>If any man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink&mdash;This he &s;pake of the &s;pirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould re|ceive.</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> vii. 37-39.</NOTE>&mdash;Who&s;oever will, <HI>let him take the water of life freely.</HI></Q><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>Concerning the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture it may be ob&s;erved, 1. That if the invitations and promi&s;es contained in them are made to unregenerate &s;inners, and wholly re&s;pect their exerci&s;es and doings while &s;uch; then the unregenerate, while &s;uch, come to the waters of life, and do actually drink of this water: yea, they come to Chri&s;t and believe on him. For the invitation is to this, and to this on|ly the promi&s;e is made. Of this any one may be certain, by carefully reading the quoted pa&s;&s;ages o|ver. It &s;eems the doctor &s;uppo&s;es the unregenerate do all this, by his thus quoting the&s;e words, as o|therwi&s;e they are not to his purpo&s;e. When he
<PB N="49" REF="010007_0061_0F7B99A1AF165DF8">
&s;hall <HI>prove</HI> this, we will acknowledge he has gain|ed his point: but till then, we mu&s;t be confident that none come to Chri&s;t, unle&s;s they are drawn by the regenerating influences of God's &s;pirit; and that they who believe on him are born of God: and that men's unwillingne&s;s, or oppo&s;ition of heart to coming to Chri&s;t, to coming and taking the wa|ter of life, is the only ground of the nece&s;&s;ity of their being born again, in order to &s;ee the king|dom of God. If therefore the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are pa|rallel to that under con&s;ideration, which I am rea|dy to allow, then hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s is the &s;ame with coming to Chri&s;t, and believing on him; therefore is peculiar to the regenerate. This leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That the <HI>hungering</HI> and <HI>thir&s;ting</HI> menti|oned in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, does not intend, at lea&s;t in all of them, a hungering and thir&s;ting <HI>after righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: but &s;omething el&s;e. When Chri&s;t &s;ays, "He that cometh unto me &s;hall <HI>never hunger,</HI> and he that believeth on me &s;hall <HI>never thir&s;t</HI>;" he does not mean a hungering and thir&s;ting <HI>after righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> He makes no promi&s;e here to this hungering and thir&s;ting, which he does to hunger|ing and thir&s;ting <HI>after righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; but the pro|mi&s;e is made to <HI>coming to him,</HI> and <HI>believing on him</HI>; and he expre&s;&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hes the hungering and thir&s;ting he here &s;peaks of from believeing, &amp;c. and repre&s;ents it as incon&s;i&s;tent with it. He that believeth on him <HI>&s;hall not</HI> hunger and thir&s;t: the one is not, cannot be, where the other is. More|over, our Saviour here a&s;&s;erts that they who come to him, &amp;c. &s;hall <HI>never</HI> have any more of that hunger and thir&s;t he here &s;peaks of. But will any

chri&s;tian believe, that no real &s;aint ever hungers and thir&s;ts after righteou&s;ne&s;s? Have they not a reli&s;h and thir&s;t for the waters of life?

By hunger|ing and thir&s;ting then, Chri&s;t here means, a being in a mi&s;erable, de&s;titute &s;tate; or un&s;atisfied de&s;ires, unea&s;ine&s;s and want, without any thing to afford relief; which is &s;ometimes, if not often, meant by hungering and thir&s;ting in &s;cripture. He here promi&s;es that they who come to him and drink the water of life, &s;hall never hunger and thir&s;t a|gain in this &s;en&s;e: &s;hall no more be in that de&s;ti|tute, mi&s;erable &s;tate, in which they were before; which may well be repre&s;ented by a per&s;on fami&s;h|ing with hunger and thir&s;t, without any thing to relieve and &s;atisfy him.</P>
<P>Let us now hear the doctor's argument from the&s;e words. <Q>How unrea&s;onable? how un&s;crip|tural, &s;ays he, were it to &s;uppo&s;e, that by tho&s;e who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, our Lord intends only the regenerate: or &s;uch as have already eaten and drank of that &s;piritual bread and water, which he giveth? <HI>E&s;pecially,</HI> when he declareth above, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hall <HI>neither</HI> hunger nor thir&s;t again!</Q></P>
<P>As all the &s;trength of the argument in the&s;e words lies in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that when our Lord &s;ays, he that cometh to him, &amp;c. &s;hall neither hunger nor thir&s;t again, he means hungering and thir&s;ting <HI>after righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> what has been ju&s;t ob|&s;erved, &s;erves to &s;hew how groundle&s;s and ab&s;urd
<PB N="51" REF="010007_0063_0F7B99A42B49E0F0">
it is. If the doctor's argument is good, it proves that by tho&s;e who hunger and thir&s;t after righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, our Lord intends <HI>only</HI> the unregenerate; and that the regenerate <HI>never do</HI> thus hunger and thir&s;t; &s;o have no true de&s;ires after God and holi|ne&s;s. Yea, it proves, according to the doctor's &s;en&s;e of the words, that the regenerate do not de|&s;ire &s;alvation. By hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, is meant, "Strong and ardent de|&s;ires to attain the righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o the &s;alva|tion revealed in the go&s;pel," as the doctor explains it. Therefore, according to him, the regenerate never hunger nor thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ire &s;alvation; this being peculiar to the unregenerate. According to this, neither David, nor Paul, nor any of the worthies we have on &s;a|cred record, were regenerate; for they hungered and thir&s;ted after righteou&s;ne&s;s; they had &s;trong and ardent de&s;ires after righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>If the&s;e things are duely con&s;idered, it will, I be|lieve, appear, that this argument of the doctor's, takes all its &s;eeming &s;trength only from a gingle of words, by jumbling &s;everal texts together, which have not the &s;ame meaning; and which, if they were taken in the doctor's &s;en&s;e of them, would be incon&s;i&s;tent with each other; with the re&s;t of the bible; with common &s;en&s;e, and even with the doctor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now the reader is to judge, whether in this view of the ca&s;e, the doctor had any real ground for the following words. "Can any man read this, and yet &s;uppo&s;e, that hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the &s;en&s;e of our Saviour, is <HI>always</HI> &s;ub&s;equent, <HI>never</HI> prior, to coming to him,
<PB N="52" REF="010007_0064_0F7B99A4B5380600">
or to regeneration? If he can, however good his heart may be, no one has much rea&s;on to envy him his head."</P>
<P>Why does the doctor expre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o guard|edly? "ALWAYS &s;ub&s;equent, NEVER prior to regeneration. If his argument above is good, and the &s;criptures referred to any thing to the purpo&s;e; it follows, as has been &s;hewn, that hungering and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, or a de&s;ire of &s;alvation is <HI>never</HI> &s;ub&s;equent, but <HI>always</HI> prior to regenerati|on: And if this is not true, the argument comes to nothing. If any man may think hungering and thir&s;ting is <HI>ever</HI> con&s;equent, and not <HI>always</HI> pri|or to regeneration; he may, as con&s;i&s;tently with all the doctor has &s;aid, think this is <HI>always</HI> &s;ub&s;e|quent, never prior to regeneration. But if the doctor had truely and fully expre&s;&s;ed the genuine con&s;equence of his premi&s;es, he would have quite &s;poiled his argument; and it would have appear|ed, at fir&s;t view, that he had proved too much for him&s;elf, or any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>It appears by the la&s;t &s;entence quoted, that I have &s;ufficiently <HI>endangered my head</HI> to the doctor&mdash;However good the doctor's may be in the main, mo&s;t readers, I imagine, will take leave to think it was not perfectly right in this in&s;tance, at lea&s;t. And I will per&s;ume to &s;ay in my turn: Can any man read this, and yet think the doctor's argu|ment &s;trong and con&s;i&s;tent? If he can, no one, I am &s;ure, has <HI>any</HI> rea&s;on to envy him his head.</P>
<P>THE doctors argument, to prove that when our Saviour promi&s;es good things, to them that <HI>a&s;k</HI> for them, he means the a&s;king of the unregenerate, &s;hall be next con&s;idered. He having ob&s;erved,
<PB N="53" REF="010007_0065_0F7B99A56D0A0F50">
that, "the good things promi&s;ed, are &s;uch as are comprehended in the gift of the Spirit," goes on to &s;ay, <Q>The promi&s;e of which, in con&s;equence of a&s;king, &s;eeking and knocking, is &s;o far from &s;uppo&s;ing that the per&s;ons who do &s;o, are already regenerate, or that the Spirit is given them prior to their a&s;king; that it rather, implies the direct contrary: <HI>viz.</HI> that they had not the &s;pi|rit in the &s;en&s;e here intended. For if they are &s;uppo&s;ed, at the time of their a&s;king, to have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, to <HI>abide with them for ever,</HI> as all the &s;ons of God by rege|neration have, what becomes of the promi&s;e? What are they to have in con&s;equence of a&s;k|ing? Is it only the continuance of the Spirit, or larger mea&s;ures of it? But the&s;e are, I think, never called, <HI>giving the &s;pirit,</HI> in the language of &s;cripture: which means the <HI>original</HI> be&s;towment of it [or him] on &s;uch as were de&s;titute of it; in con&s;equence of which, they are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit, or of God.</Q> As a man is but <HI>once</HI> born of God, or of the &s;pirit, &s;o the Spi|rit is, properly &s;peaking, "never <HI>given more</HI> than <HI>once</HI>: For being once given, he is to <HI>be in, and abide with believers for ever.</HI>"<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 64.</NOTE></P>
<P>If the following things are attended to, it will be ea&s;ily &s;een how little weight there is in this ar|gument.</P>
<P N="1">1. The regeneration is produced by the Spirit of God: yet in affecting this change, he is not gi|ven, properly &s;peaking, to abide in them for ever, as a promi&s;ed, abiding principle of holine&s;s: but
<PB N="54" REF="010007_0066_0F7B99A85DBF3048">
the holy &s;pirit is thus given, after regeneration, in con&s;equence of faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to which the gift of the Spirit is often and always promi&s;ed. The &s;pirit of God in regenerating men, operates not as a promi&s;ed gift or agent; but regeneration is effected as an <HI>unpromi&s;ed</HI> favor. There are no promi&s;es to any particular per&s;ons, of the gift of the Spirit, in this &s;en&s;e, to produce this change in them, in which they are wholly pa&s;&s;ive: nor are there any promi&s;es in the bible to regeneration it|&s;elf, or to the regenerate, antecedent to any exer|ci&s;e of holine&s;s, but only to tho&s;e exerci&s;es, which are the fruit and con&s;equence of regeneration. This remark is &s;ufficient to &s;hew the doctor's mi&s;take, in &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;pirit of God is given in regene|ration, as the &s;pirit of promi&s;e, to abide with them for ever; on which mi&s;take the whole force of his argument re&s;ts. But this will be more fully con|firmed by what follows.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho' the &s;pirit of God is in a &s;en&s;e given in regeneration, as it is an effect produced by the &s;pi|rit; yet he is not herein given as he is to the be|liever, as a promi&s;ed, abiding principle of holine&s;s. In this latter &s;en&s;e, in which &s;en&s;e alone he is pro|mi&s;ed, he is given to tho&s;e who believe, or tho&s;e who a&s;k him, which are really one and the &s;ame thing, as will be more fully con&s;idered by and by. Chri&s;t promi&s;es the &s;pirit to tho&s;e who come to him, or believe on him. "Je&s;us &s;tood and cri|ed, &s;aying, If any man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me as the &s;cripture hath &s;aid, out of his belly &s;hall flow ri|vers of living water. This &s;poke he of the Spirit,
<PB N="55" REF="010007_0067_0F7B99A8E695D2A8">
which they that <HI>believe on him</HI> &s;hould receive."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> vii. 37, 38, 39.</NOTE> Now I tru&s;t the doctor will not deny that men mu&s;t be regenerated, or born of God, antecedent to their believing on Chri&s;t, or in order to this: If he &s;hould, the apo&s;tle John will confute him; for he &s;ays, "Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God."<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>John</HI> v. 1.</NOTE> If they who believe on Chri&s;t are already born of God; then when Chri&s;t promi&s;es the Spirit to them who believe on him, he means &s;omething by the gift of the Spirit which is not given in regeneration, and &s;omething more, even that he &s;hould be in them for ever as an abiding principle of &s;piritual life or holine&s;s. Exactly parallel to this, are the words &s;poken by the &s;ame per&s;on, long before, "Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my &s;pirit unto you."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> i. 23.</NOTE> To turn at wi&s;dom's reproof, is the &s;ame with coming to Chri&s;t, or believing on him; and in con&s;equence of this, the &s;pirit is promi&s;ed to be poured out upon them, as our Saviour promi&s;es the Spirit to tho&s;e who come to him, by the &s;ame me|taphor, <HI>water.</HI> We may not hence infer that per&s;ons are to turn to Chri&s;t without the Spirit, or antecedent to regeneration; but that being re|generated by the unpromi&s;ed influence of the di|vine Spirit, they turn at wi&s;dom's reproof, come to Chri&s;t, and believe on him, and &s;o a&s;k him for all good things; to which the Spirit is prom&s;ed, to be in them for ever. We hence &s;ee how great|ly mi&s;taken the doctor was in &s;uppo&s;ing in the pa&s;|&s;age above quoted, that when the &s;cripture &s;peaks of giving the Spirit, it always means, "the origi|nal
<PB N="56" REF="010007_0068_0F7B99AA1979E578">
be&s;towment of him, in con&s;equence of which men are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit of God." For our Saviour &s;peaks of giving the Spirit to them who believe on him; but believing on him is in con&s;equence of the original be&s;towment of the Spirit in regeneration: for &s;uch, St. John &s;ays, are already born of God. Therefore, after men have received the Spirit, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their being born of God, they mu&s;t believe on Chri&s;t, or come to him, and a&s;k him, in order to receive the Spirit in the &s;en&s;e in which he is pro|mi&s;ed by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Exactly agreeable to this are the words of St. Paul. "That we might <HI>receive</HI> the promi&s;e of the Spirit through faith<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 14.</NOTE>" "In whom al&s;o <HI>after that ye believed,</HI> ye were &s;ealed with the holy Spirit of promi&s;e."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rph.</HI> i. 13.</NOTE> Here he &s;peaks of the gift of the Spirit as promi&s;ed to men, in which he doubtle&s;s has reference to the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t now un|der con&s;ideration, among others. And this, he &s;ays, they received <HI>through faith,</HI> and <HI>after they bad believed</HI>: therefore <HI>after</HI> they were regenerate. Faith then is the condition of this promi&s;e, and not any doings of the unregenerate. Again he &s;ays, "And <HI>becau&s;e ye are &s;ons,</HI> God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts."<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 6.</NOTE> He here &s;peaks of the gift or be&s;towment of the Spirit in con&s;equence of their being the &s;ons of God: and he had ju&s;t told how they became the &s;ons or children of God: <HI>viz.</HI> that they were "all the children of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us"<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> iii. 26.</NOTE> And it is worthy of remark here, that the promi&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="010007_0069_0F7B99AAAE810B68">
which Chri&s;t makes of the &s;pirit to his di&s;ciples, to abide with them forever, to which the doctor alludes, is made to tho&s;e who were already regene|rate; and he expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, the world, that is, the unregenerate, cannot receive the Spirit in the &s;en&s;e in which he is here promi&s;ed.<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See John</HI> xiv. 16, 17.</NOTE> He therefore does not mean what the doctor calls "the original be&s;towment" of the Spirit. If the doctor had well attended to all this, the paragraph of his, now un|der con&s;ideration, would mo&s;t probably never have &s;een the light.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho' the &s;pirit operates in a &s;en&s;e and degree in regeneration; yet as he does not regenerate men as being given as an abiding principle of life, but this change is produced as an <HI>unpromi&s;ed</HI> favor, which neither unites them to Chri&s;t, nor gives them an intere&s;t to any promi&s;e in the bible, there appears great propriety in promi&s;ing the Spirit as an abiding principle of eternal life, which compre|hends all good things, to tho&s;e exerci&s;es or acts by which the regenerate actively unite them&s;elves to Chri&s;t, and come to him, tru&s;t in him, and <HI>a&s;k</HI> in his name for this great benefit. And our being directed to believe on Chri&s;t in order to this, and a&s;k for the Spirit in this &s;en&s;e, with a promi&s;e that he &s;hall be given, is no argument, that in order to thus believing and a&s;king, we mu&s;t not fir&s;t be born of God, therefore the doctor's argument is, wholly without foundation. The doctor him&s;elf allows that per&s;ons mu&s;t have the influences of the Spirit of God in order to &s;trive, or a&s;k for the Spi|rit &s;o as to be intitled to the promi&s;e.<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See P.</HI> 21, 40, 73.</NOTE> There|fore
<PB N="58" REF="010007_0070_0F7B99AB73B86AE0">
they have the Spirit in &s;ome &s;en&s;e when they a&s;k, and in order to their a&s;king: and therefore, according to him, the promi&s;e of the Spirit to them who a&s;k does not imply that per&s;ons mu&s;t not have the Spirit in order to a&s;k. If therefore there is any rea&s;on in what he &s;ays, which indeed there is not, it is as much again&s;t him&s;elf, as any body el&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is acknowledged that the Spirit is given <HI>but once</HI> as he is promi&s;ed by our Saviour. He is giv|en to believers never to be taken away: but this gift of the Spirit men never receive in regenerati|on, as has been &s;hewn; but in con&s;equence of that faith, that coming to Chri&s;t, and a&s;king him, for which regeneration lays the only foundation. And as this gift is promi&s;ed to believing and a&s;king; &s;o it can be received in no other way. And never is given but in con&s;equence of a&s;king.</P>
<P N="5">5. As this gift is fir&s;t received in a way of believ|ing and a&s;king, &s;o it is continued, and the Spirit abides in believers by the exerci&s;e of faith, or their continuing to a&s;k for the Spirit in a per&s;evering way. Therefore men are not only to a&s;k for the Spirit in order to their fir&s;t receiving this gift; but are to continue to a&s;k, in order to the Spirit's a|biding in them, and perfecting the work he has begun. This direction and promi&s;e of our Savi|our is therefore applicable to true chri&s;tians at all times.</P>
<P>The doctor does not expre&s;&s;ly deny this; but the whole of what he &s;ays is incon&s;i&s;tent with it. If believers having the Spirit dwelling in them, with a promi&s;e that he &s;hall abide with them for e|ver, renders it ab&s;urd for them any more to a&s;k
<PB N="59" REF="010007_0071_0F7B99AC30B75FE0">
for this favor, which compri&s;es all good things: then certainly they mu&s;t a&s;k <HI>no more,</HI> where once they are born of God, and have received the Spi|rit. And if, true chri&s;tians are never to a&s;k for the Spirit, becau&s;e he is in them, and they have the promi&s;e that he &s;hall abide with them for ever; then they are never more to a&s;k for any good thing, as all the&s;e are comprized in the gift of the Spirit. Does the doctor mean to repre&s;ent prayer as incon|&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd in the true chri&s;tian, who is born of the Spirit of God? It certainly is &s;o, if there is any rea&s;on or propriety in what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>If, as the Doctor ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings and good things are comprehended in the gift of the Spirit: and therefore a&s;king for the &s;pi|rit is the &s;ame with a&s;king for &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, or good things in general. And if when the Spirit is once given, as he is to all the regenerate, there is no rea&s;on or propriety in a&s;king for the Spirit; up|on which po&s;ition the doctor's argument is whol|ly grounded: then they who are regenerate have no &s;piritual good thing to a&s;k for; con&s;equently prayer is no part of their duty: This belongs only to the unregenerate. How contrary to this is the &s;cripture account of the matter! This teaches true chri&s;tians to pray without cea&s;ing: to pray <HI>always</HI> with all prayer. And this, although they already have the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit. There we find &s;uch words as the&s;e. "Likewi&s;e the Spirit al&s;o helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it|&s;elf maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us with groanings that cannot be uttered."<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 26.</NOTE> "Praying always with all

<P N="6">6. On the whole, it appears, that turning at wi&s;dom's reproof, coming to Chri&s;t, or believing on him, a willingne&s;s to take of the water of life, and a&s;king good things of God, are all one and the &s;ame thing, or at lea&s;t imply each other; and therefore the promi&s;e of the Spirit, which is the &s;um of all good, is made to this. But in order to men's coming up to this condition of the promi&s;e, they mu&s;t, according to &s;cripture, fir&s;t be born of the Spirit of God. In order really and heartily to a&s;k for good things there mu&s;t be a real and hear|ty willingne&s;s to have them, or a de&s;ire of them con&s;idered as what they are; and indeed, <HI>a&s;king</HI> is nothing but a proper exerci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch willingne&s;s and de&s;ire. But this is the &s;ame with coming to Chri&s;t, receiving him, or believing on him: In order to which men mu&s;t be regenerat|ed, as has been before &s;hewn. They who with their whole hearts reject all the good things the go&s;pel offers, &s;urely do not in any true &s;en&s;e <HI>a&s;k</HI> for them. But this is true of all unregenerate men.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. <HI>THE Doctor's</HI> ninth <HI>and</HI> twelfth <HI>arguments exa|mined.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE now come to the <HI>ninth</HI> argument which the doctor has produced in favor of his hypo|the&s;is. This is in the following words. <Q>In Eze|kiel [chap. 36.] God declares his purpo&s;e to do many things for the people of I&s;rael: and, a|mong the re&s;t, to give them a <HI>new heart,</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit.</HI> But he adds afterwards. <HI>I will be enquired of by the</HI> hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them. Which unque&s;tionably relates in part to the new heart and new &s;pirit, &s;poken of before. Upon which we may briefly remark, That e|ternal life, or &s;alvation, is connected in &s;cripture with the having a new heart: That &s;uch an heart is the gift of God: That he gives &s;uch an heart, not prior to, but in con&s;equence of, be|ing enquired of, or &s;ought to, for it. And con|&s;equently, that the enquiring of God, here in|tended, is the act, not of the regenerate, but the unregenerate; who are awakened to <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> and &s;eck after it.</Q></P>
<P>If this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture is duely attended to, it will appear, I doubt not, that it affords no foun|dation for what the doctor attempts to argue from it.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="010007_0074_0F7B99B22B7F44E8">There are two things promi&s;ed by God in this chapter, which he would do in behalf of the peo|ple of I&s;rael, now under his correction for their &s;ins; both of which depended, not on them, but on God's &s;overeign determination to do it, not for their &s;akes, but for his own holy name's &s;ake. This is repeatedly declared in this very pa&s;&s;age.<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 22, 23.</NOTE> God is thro' this whole pa&s;&s;age repre&s;ented, not as wait|ing for them to do &s;omething, in order to his be|&s;towing good things promi&s;ed to them on this con|dition; but declares what &s;hall be, in which he him&s;elf is the <HI>fir&s;t mover,</HI> and which he will ac|compli&s;h in and for them, independent of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. One thing promi&s;ed is, that he would bring them from the &s;tate of captivity and affliction in which they now were in Babylon, and re-&s;ettle them in the land of Canaan, in a &s;tate of pro&s;pe|rity, and there greatly increa&s;e and multiply them.</P>

The heart with which they were to make &s;upplication to God, enquire of him and &s;eek him for what they wanted, was not an uncircumci&s;ed, &s;tupid, ignorant, hard, impenitent, rebellious, proud heart; but an heart of fle&s;h, a penitent, humble, obedient heart; a heart to con|fe&s;s and for&s;ake their &s;ins, and loath them&s;elves for them.</P>

<P N="2">2. It is al&s;o evident, that this condition of their deliverance and &s;alvation, the whole of it taken to|gether, is it&s;elf promi&s;ed by God, as what he would work in them. God him&s;elf promi&s;es not only to deliver them out of captivity; but to cir|cumci&s;e their hearts, to give them an heart of fle&s;h, by which they &s;hould become a humble penitent people, and turn to him, and &s;eek him with all their heart, as a proper preparative for the out|ward deliverance he had promi&s;ed. When God &s;ays, in the text under con&s;ideration, "I will yet

for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them," it is to be con&s;idered as a promi&s;e that he will bring them to this, by giving them a hum|ble, praying heart, which they were far from then; which therefore mu&s;t be a <HI>new heart.</HI> God pro|mi&s;es that he will bring them to &s;eek him with their whole hearts, which is expre&s;&s;ed thus in words before cited, "they &s;hall come with weep|ing, and <HI>with &s;upplications</HI> will I lead them." But they could not be brought to this, while their hearts were uncircumci&s;ed, and hearts of &s;tone; but in order to this, God mu&s;t circumci&s;e their hearts to love him, and give them an heart of fle&s;h; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to accompl&s;h it any other. way. So far is this <HI>&s;eeking God</HI> from being ante|cedent to a new heart, and required, as what mu&s;t take place in order to it.</P>
<P>What do they mean who flatter &s;inners that they may &s;incerely and heartily, or with their whole hearts &s;eek a <HI>new heart,</HI> as the condition of ob|taining it, and that to which a new heart is pro|mi&s;ed? Are not all the exerci&s;es of an impeni|tent, rebellious heart, impenitent, rebellious ex|erci&s;es? and does not the old heart perfectly hate and oppo&s;e a new heart? Does not the fle&s;h lu&s;t a|gain&s;t the &s;pirit? and are not the&s;e contrary the one to the other? What &s;inceriry and heartine&s;s then is there in a&s;king for a new heart with a heart &s;o perfectly oppo&s;ite to the thing a&s;ked for? The doctor &s;ays, "It were highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that a man mu&s;t have a new heart, in order to his enquiring of, or &s;eeking God, in &s;uch a manner, as to obtain &s;uch an heart of him."<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 59.</NOTE> It may be

For this is as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;in and ob&s;tina|cy it&s;elf is reconciled to holine&s;s, and &s;ubjection to God's law. There is no &s;uch thing &s;uppo&s;ed in the bible; nor will common &s;en&s;e admit of it, however commonly it has been &s;uppo&s;ed; and tho' the doctor has done it, not only in the argu|ment under con&s;ideration, but through all his per|formance.</P>
<P>On the whole, does it not appear beyond con|tradiction, from this view of the ca&s;e, that <HI>enquir|ing of God,</HI> in the text under con&s;ideration, is the &s;ame with what is called by Jeremiah, when &s;peak|ing of the &s;ame thing, <HI>&s;eeking God,</HI> and <HI>&s;earching for him with their</HI> WHOLE HEARTS; and that this is &s;eeking God with a new heart.

<P>THE doctor takes his <HI>twelfth</HI> argument from the following words of the apo&s;tle Peter. "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godline&s;s, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promi&s;es, that by the&s;e you might be made partakers of the divine nature, hav|ing e&s;caped the corruption that is in the world through lu&s;t."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Peter</HI> i. 3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="010007_0083_0F7B99BC53CE4448">By the "things pertaining to life and godline&s;s," the doctor under&s;tands, the external priviledges of the go&s;pel, among which he reckons "the great and precious promi&s;es." The end of which, he &s;ays, is, our being made "partakers of the divine na|ture," which is the &s;ame with a new heart. And "e&s;caping the corruptions that are in the world thro' lu&s;ts." he takes to be the &s;ame with &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate. And he finally ob&s;erves," that this divine nature or new heart, is given in a way of promi&s;e, or in the fulfilment of the promi&s;|es." Hence he infers that there are promi&s;es of a new heart to the unregenerate, who &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</P>
<P>If by "all things partaining to life and godli|ne&s;s" are meant the gifts, qualifications and peculiar advantages be&s;towed by the divine power, even that mighty power, which is exerci&s;ed towards them who believe,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19.</NOTE> be&s;towed, I &s;ay, on true chri&s;tians, to whom the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking, who have obtained <HI>precious faith,</HI> thro' or in the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>ver.</HI> 1.</NOTE> If by, "exceeding great and precious promi&s;es" are meant the promi&s;es of all good things, made to God's people, but more e&s;pecially of the heavenly inheritance.

However, it may not be improper here to collect the whole of this kind, &s;o as to give a plain &s;hort view of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Man is not only by &s;in plunged into a &s;tate of in|finite guilt; from which he cannot be delivered, con&s;i&s;tent with the law and moral government he is under, unle&s;s he is intere&s;ted in, or united to, the Mediator: but he has al&s;o by his apo&s;tacy lo&s;t the moral image of God, or all true holine&s;s; and con|&s;equently is wholly corrupt, and under the domi|nion of appetites and inclinations directly contrary to God and his law.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Mayhew allows that men are de&s;titute of all true holine&s;s untill they are born again, or have a new heart given them in regeneration. [P. 42.] Yet, [P. 73] he repre&s;ents the exerci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate, as having &s;omething of the nature of obedience to God in them; and therefore <HI>GOOD</HI>; and con&s;equently not <HI>wholly</HI> unplea&s;ing to God. I &s;hould be glad to know of the doctor what that obedience is, which falls wholly &s;hort of true holine&s;s. If it is obeaience to God's law, it is true holine&s;s, if there is any &s;uch thing in nature; if it is not obedience to God's law, How, and in what &s;en&s;e is it any obedience at al.? He will be plea&s;ed al&s;o to tell us, what that is in the exerci&s;|es and doings of the unregenerate, which is of the nature of <HI>GOOD,</HI> and yet has nothing of the nature of true holine&s;s. The world has yet found out but two &s;orts of good, viz natural and moral, holine&s;s and happine&s;s. But as the doctor means neither of the&s;e by the <HI>GOOD</HI> that is found with unregenerate men; he would oblige the world, if he would tell what this new di&s;covered <HI>GOOD</HI> is.</P>
<P>The doctor's repre&s;enting the doings of wicked men as good, and &s;ense degree plea&s;ing to God, brings to my mind the words of Malathy. [chap. Ii. 17.] "Ye have wearied the Lord with your words: yet you &s;ay. Wherein have we wearied him? When ye &s;ay, Every one that doth evil, <HI>is good in the &s;ight of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>he delighteth in them.</HI>" Our Saviour &s;ays, "A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit." Very agreeable to this, a noted author well ob&s;erves," It is the <HI>good tree ONLY,</HI> that bringeth forth <HI>good fruit</HI>; and it is <HI>ONLY</HI> a <HI>good men,</HI> out of the <HI>good trea&s;ure of his heart,</HI> that bringeth forth <HI>good things.</HI> An <HI>HOLY PRINCIPLE</HI> within, is con&s;idered in &s;cripture as <HI>pri|or to good works,</HI> the latter being the exertions and operations of the former." <HI>Dr. Mayhew's &s;ermons on various &s;ubjects. p. 191..</HI></P></NOTE> This is the carnal mind
<PB N="75" REF="010007_0087_0F7B99BEF60EFD40">
which the &s;cripture &s;ays, "is enmity again&s;t God; For it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii.</NOTE> This corruption or viciou&s;ne&s;s of heart being &s;o great and univer&s;al, the &s;inner will not repent, or have any right exerci&s;es towards God and his law, untill his heart is in &s;ome degree renewed and <HI>&s;et right.</HI> In this &s;tate the go&s;pel finds man; in which pardon and &s;alvation, through a mediator are freely offered to his acceptance; and all are invited to come to Chri&s;t, believe on him and tru&s;t in him, for al! they want; being a&s;&s;ured, that on this condition, Chri&s;t, with all his bene|fits, &s;hall be theirs.</P>
<P>But as the way in which this &s;alvation is given, is in a peculiar manner adapted to do honor to the
<PB N="76" REF="010007_0088_0F7B99BFAD18E430">
law which the &s;inner has broken, and vindicate the divine character, to which he is a perfect enemy: and as the Saviour him&s;elf, in all he has done in the character of a Mediator, has above all others condemned &s;in, and manife&s;ted his love of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and hatred of iniquity: and as the &s;alvation it&s;elf which he gives, con&s;i&s;ts &s;ummarily in deliver|ance from &s;in, and the exerci&s;e and enjoyment of true holine&s;s, the &s;inner is in a peculiar manner an enemy to the go&s;pel; to the Mediator, viewed in his true character; to the way in which he &s;aves &s;inners; and to the &s;alvation it&s;elf. And he al|ways continues &s;o while an enemy to holine&s;s, and an impenitent: or until his heart is changed, and he comes to a new temper and di&s;po&s;ition. This change of the corrupt heart is in &s;cripture &s;poken of as the work of the Spirit of God, in which &s;in|ners are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit, to have the &s;tony heart taken away and an heart of fle&s;h, or a new heart given; to be quickened, or made alive from the dead; created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, &amp;c. It is al&s;o called the wa&s;hing; of rege|neration and the renewing of the the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>As men do in their natural &s;tate with their whole hearts reject the good things offered in the go&s;pel: and their doing &s;o, is wholly owing to an inexcutable wickedne&s;s of heart, God is not obliged, in rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, to remove this voluntary wicked inexcu|&s;able oppo&s;ition and bring them to a willing com|pliance with his propo&s;als: Neither has he oblig|ed him&s;elf to do this for any, by promi&s;es to any thing which they &s;hall do, as the condition of it. Therefore whenever, and in whatever in&s;tance, God takes away the heart of &s;tone, and gives a
<PB N="77" REF="010007_0089_0F7B99C0EBE7BF00">
new heart, he acts as being unobliged, or &s;ove|reignly, and be&s;tows an <HI>unpromi&s;ed</HI> favor; and &s;o "has mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will be hardeneth" <HI>i. e.</HI> leaves under the dominion of a hard, &s;tony heart. But when God gives a new heart in regeneration, a foundation is laid in the mind for a di&s;cerning of the truths, of the go&s;pel in their real beauty and excellency, (to which the unregenerate heart, or the mind under the dominion of lu&s;t is wholly blind) and for tho&s;e right exerci&s;es, in which faith or chri&s;tian holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. And all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are made to the&s;e <HI>exerci&s;es</HI> of the mind, in which the mind di&s;cerns divine truth in &s;ome mea&s;ure as it is, and heartily embraces the go&s;pel, &amp;c. And the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of this kind, intitles the per&s;on to all divine promi&s;es; to pardon of &s;in, and eternal life, and to all tho&s;e divine influences, by which he &s;hall per&s;evere in faith and holine&s;s, untill he &s;hall be perfectly delivered from all &s;in, and awake com|pleat <HI>in God's likene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>There mu&s;t therefore be a di&s;tinction kept up be|tween regeneration, which is the work of God in giving a new heart, and in which men are perfect|ly pa&s;&s;ive; and <HI>active</HI> conver&s;ion in which men, being regenerated, turn from &s;in to God, in the exerci&s;e of repentance towards God, and faith to|ward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and in con&s;equence of which they are pardoned and received to favor, and a title to eternal life; and have the gift of the Spirit to dwell with them for ever, as an abiding principle of life and holine&s;s. All this, with eve|ry benefit which men receive by Chri&s;t, is pro|mi&s;ed to tho&s;e who believe, or heartily embrace
<PB N="78" REF="010007_0090_0F7B99C163222400">
go&s;pel, and not to regeneration: for to this, con|&s;idered as antecedent to all <HI>action,</HI> and only as tho foundation of right exerci&s;e, no promi&s;e is made. Neither are tho&s;e influences by which men are re|generated in this &s;en&s;e, meant by giving, or re|ceiving the Spirit, as the Spirit of promi&s;e, by which believers, and they only, are &s;ealed to the day of redemption: but men receive the Spirit, in this &s;en&s;e, as a &s;pirit of adaption, by which all God's children are led, by faith, or a hearty re|ceiving Chri&s;t with all his benefits.<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See John</HI> i. 12, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 14, 26, <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 13.</NOTE> They who will not make and understand this di&s;tinction, mu&s;t think and talk in &s;ome mea&s;ure unintelligibly on this point.</P>
<P>This change therefore, called regeneration, by which a new heart is given; as the foundation of all true di&s;cerning of the things of God's moral kingdom, and of all right exerci&s;es of heart; this change, I &s;ay, "wrought by the Spirit of God immediately and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and altogether imperceptibly to the per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of it; it being impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould know what God has done for him, but by a conciou&s;ne&s;s of his own views and exerci&s;es, which are the fruit and con&s;equence of the divine operation. The&s;e views and exerci&s;es of the regenerate, in which they turn from &s;in to God, or embrace the go&s;pel, are often in &s;cripture &s;poken of as included in that change which is called a being born again, &amp;c. as all the change which is perceptible, and in which man is active con&s;i&s;ts in this. And this is &s;ometimes cal|led by divines <HI>active conver&s;ion,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it
<PB N="79" REF="010007_0091_0F7B99C286F599D8">
from regeneration, or that change in which men are pa&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Men being wa&s;hed by regeneration, and renew|ed by the Holy Gho&s;t; the hard rebellious heart being &s;ubdued in a degree, and a new and oppo|&s;ite bia&s;s, which is by our Saviour called an <HI>hone&s;t and good heart,</HI> being given, the light and truth of God's word, enters into the mind, and it di&s;cerns the things of the Spirit of God in their reality, beauty, wi&s;dom, glory: and in this view and &s;en&s;e of divine truths, the heart approves of the divine character, comes to Chri&s;t for life, or believes on him, and &s;incerely and heartily a&s;ks for the Spirit, or that living water which Chri&s;t gives, and which comprehends all good things. And to this huger|ing and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, coming to Chri&s;t, believing on him and tra&s;ting in him; to <HI>this</HI> a&s;king, knocking, &s;eeking, divine promi&s;|es are made, even to the fir&s;t and lowe&s;t degree of this kind of exerci&s;e. To &s;uch the Spirit is given as a fountain; "a well of living water, &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life."<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iv. 14.</NOTE> And by this actively cleaving to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in a view of his true cha|racter as Mediator and Saviour, and uniting them|&s;elves to him, a proper foundation is laid for their being looked upon and treated, as being in him, and in a &s;en&s;e one with him; &s;o that on his ac|count, out of re&s;pect to his merit and worthine&s;s, they are pardoned and received to favor; they be|come the children of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and heirs of eternal life. And as they have thus received Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, &s;o they walk in

<P>THE unregenerate Sinner may be in a &s;ort con|vinced in his judgment and con&s;cience that he has by his &s;in expo&s;ed him&s;elf to eternal de&s;truction; that he can be delivered from this evil, and obtain &s;alvation only by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by coming to him and believing on him; and that in order to this he mu&s;t have a new heart given him by God, &amp;c. And he may have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of his danger and mi&s;ery, and of the awful con&s;equence of &s;in, as to fill his mind with great unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s. This may, while it continues, deaden him-to all carnal gratifications, and make him afraid to in|dulge him&s;elf to any overt acts of known &s;in; and lead him to make deliverance from future mi&s;ery his great concern, and earne&s;tly to &s;eek this in the u&s;e of all means; being all attention to the great concerns of his &s;oul, and a future world. But all this does not alter the reigning temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion of the heart. There may be yet no more true hatred of &s;in than before, and a reigning en|mity again&s;t the divine character, and law, and a|gain&s;t the go&s;pel; and the heart may therefore be as far from repentance, and acceptance of offered &s;al|vation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t as ever, and really reject and abhor the good things offered in the go&s;pel: and &s;o be far from truly de&s;iring and a&s;king for them, And this is certainly the ca&s;e with every unregene|rate per&s;on, whatever concern and exerci&s;es he may
<PB N="81" REF="010007_0093_0F7B99C5C7F12C30">
have about the &s;alvation of his &s;oul; and whatever he may pretend and think of him&s;elf. If he thinks better of him&s;elf, as thou&s;ands do, it is all delu&s;i|on: And they who go about to &s;trengthen and confirm men in &s;uch delu&s;ion, are &s;trengthening the cau&s;e of the prince of darkne&s;s, in&s;tead of pro|moting the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and the &s;alvation of &s;inners.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore think my&s;elf doing God &s;er|vice, and that which tends to promote the good of mankind, while I attempt to prove, that there are no promi&s;es of regenerating grace or &s;alvation, made to the&s;e exerci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate in the holy &s;cripture.

<P>THAT the doctor's arguments to &s;upport the affirmative of the que&s;tion before us, are by no means &s;atisfactory and conclu&s;ive, I have en|deavoured to &s;hew. I &s;hall now attempt to prove

<P>I. ARG. THAT there are no promi&s;es of regene|rating grace made to the exerci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate, may be argued from many par|ticular pa&s;&s;ages in holy &s;cripture.</P>

But if the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are made to the doings of unregenerate &s;inners, then I they have a title to God's favor, and eternal &s;alva|tion, antecedent to faith, or while they are unbe|lievers; and therefore while they are condemned, and under the doom of eternal damnation. They

are therefore at the &s;ame time, intere&s;ted in all the divine promi&s;es, under God's favor and &s;miles, and accepted of him to a title to life; and yet un|der all the cur&s;es written in God's book, in a &s;tate of condemnation, and under the wrath of God. We cannot avoid this glaring ab&s;urdity and contra|diction, without concluding that there are no pro|mi&s;es of &s;aving mercy made to &s;inners, upon any condition &s;hort of faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and there|fore may be &s;ure there are no &s;uch promi&s;es.<NOTE N="(&s;)" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Mayhew him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts, that all unregenerate men art under a &s;entence of condemnation and death [p. 26] <Q>As &s;inful creatures, &s;ays he, we are already expo&s;ed to perdition from the avageing ju|&s;tice of God; yea, we are actually under a &s;entence of condemnation and death, till &s;uch time as we are delivered there from, by having an intere&s;t in the redemption wrought out by Chri&s;t.

<P>All unregenerate pe&s;ons then are, according to this, in a &s;tate of condemnation and death, and are in the way to eternal de&s;truction.

they &s;ay, is the way to life; and by walking in which, they &s;hall not die, but live: But St. Paul &s;ays, it is the way to death, and by walking in it, they &s;hall die: none being free from condemnati|on, and in the way to life, but they who have the Spirit of God dwelling in them; do live after the the Spirit, do through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body; are in the &s;pirit, and led by the Spi|rit; and &s;o are the &s;ons of God.

<P>St. Paul here divides men into two cla&s;&s;es and no more: one are the &s;ons of God, who have the Spirit of Chri&s;t dwelling in them, who walk after the Spirit and are led by the Spirit, and through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body.

by him. That this is true of all the unregenerate has been &s;hewn;<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sec. III.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that there is no need of dwell|ing long upon it here. It has been ob&s;erved that in <HI>this</HI> men's unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts &s;o that to &s;uppo&s;e them to be in any degree friendly to the go&s;pel at heart, is to &s;uppo&s;e them to be regenerate: or at lea&s;t that they &s;tand in no need of regeneration, in order to &s;alvation. To &s;uppo&s;e the unregenerate are not at heart enemies to the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, and that any of the exerci&s;es of their hearts about this &s;alvation, are not con&s;i&s;tent with enmity again&s;t, and oppo&s;ition to it, is to take away all di&s;tinction be|tween the regenerate and the unregenerate: To be &s;ure, it takes away that by which alone they are di&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;cripture. If any are at a lo&s;s a|bout this, let them read their bibles over, with a &s;pecial view to this point: and then let them tell, what is meant by the unregenerate; what unrege|neracy con&s;i&s;ts in; and what regeneration is, on &s;uppo&s;ition the unregenerate do not with their whole hearts reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t and oppo&s;e the way of &s;alvation by him, as being enemies to God and the Saviour. If they are not willing to be at this pains, let them turn to the viii. chap, to the Ro|mans, the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now under con&s;ideration. There it is &s;aid "the carnal mind is enmity a|gain&s;t God;&mdash;is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." That by the carnal mind is meant the unregenerate heart, in di&s;tinction from tho&s;e who are &s;piritually minded, have the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and walk after the &s;pirit; who love God, and are his children, has been ju&s;t now proved.
<PB N="89" REF="010007_0101_0F7B9912748ABAB8">
And I know not how any one can doubt of this, who will carefully read that chapter. But if the carnal, unregenerate heart, is full of enmity again&s;t God and his law, it is equally an enemy to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel: For the divine character and the holy law of God, are more fully vindicat|ed and honored, and are &s;et in a clearer view, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel, than otherwi&s;e they could be; and are &s;o interwoven through the whole go&s;|pel &s;cheme, that it cannot be under&s;tood and approv|ed of, any further than God's law, and his character therein expre&s;&s;ed, are &s;een and loved: and there|fore every degree of enmity again&s;t God and his law, is, to the &s;ame degree, and in a peculiar man|ner, enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Now that exerci&s;es of enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t, and oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel, and the &s;alvation therein revealed and offered; or tho&s;e which are con&s;i&s;tent with this, are made the condition of a title to and intere&s;t in this &s;alvation; &s;o as that all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are made to &s;uch ex|erci&s;es and acts, I pre&s;ume none will believe. This &s;eems to be &s;o &s;elf-evident, that it is needle&s;s to go about to prove it. Nothing therefore &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to decide the point we are upon, but to keep in view the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and attend to the real character of the unregenerate, and the nature and quality of all their actions.</P>
<P>It is therefore ob&s;ervable, that men, in arguing that there are promi&s;es to the doings of the unre|generate, do always overlook the true character of &s;uch, and of their exerci&s;es; yea &s;uppo&s;e them to be in a degree friendly to Chri&s;t, and the &s;alvation by him.

<P>IV. ARG. If &s;alvation is offered to all who heartily de&s;ire it, really choo&s;e and accept of it, and &s;o truely a&s;k for it: it is offered on terms low enough: as low as any can rea&s;onably de&s;ire; yea, on the lowe&s;t conceivable or even po&s;&s;ible terms. But no unregenerate per&s;on comes up to the&s;e terms. Therefore &s;alvation is not offered or promi&s;ed to any doings of the unregenerate.</P>
<P>If a free gift is offered and promi&s;ed to any one that de&s;ires it, and is willing to take it, it cannot be offered on lower or ea&s;ier terms. If any &s;hould &s;ay, 'Yes, it may be offered or promi&s;ed to a per|&s;on, whether he will have it or no: &s;o that he &s;hall have it, even contrary to his will and choice.' I an&s;wer, this is not to offer it on lower and ea&s;ier terms. It is not to offer it on any terms; neither is it properly any offer or promi&s;e at all: it is only a declaration of what &s;hall be; which is, all things con&s;idered, contrary to the will and inclination of the per&s;on. But indeed there can be no &s;uch de|claration properly and truly made. A per&s;on while unwilling to accept of, and have any gift and en|joyment 9 and while he rejects it with his whole heart, is not capable of receiving it, or of cordial|ly entertaining the offer of it; and therefore is not a &s;ubject capable of &s;uch an offer, with a promi&s;e
<PB N="91" REF="010007_0103_0F7B9913F405B020">
that it &s;hall be his, even while he undervalues, de&s;pi&s;es, and refu&s;es to receive it. If it is offered with a promi&s;e that it &s;hall be his, as &s;oon as he is heartily willing to accept of it, and upon this con|dition only; it is offered on the lowe&s;t terms that ever any offer was, or can be made. Now, it is granted that the go&s;pel offers &s;alvation to all who will accept of it, or are truely willing to have it. But as no unregenerate per&s;on is thus willing to ac|cept of &s;alvation, no &s;uch one ever did, or ever will come up to the&s;e lowe&s;t po&s;&s;ible terms, on which &s;alvation is offered and promi&s;ed.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>This la&s;t propo&s;ition has been proved in the third &s;ection, end under the la&s;t argument.</HI></NOTE> It would be highly ab&s;urd and ridiculous to offer that to any one, which is the object of his peculi|ar aver&s;ion and hatred, under the notion of its be|ing his by &s;omething he is to do as the condition of it, while he continues thus aver&s;e to it: And therefore no &s;uch offer was ever &s;eriou&s;ly and real|ly made. We may therefore be certain God has never done this: but that the lowe&s;t terms on which &s;alvation is offered and promi&s;ed, imply a real choice of this &s;alvation, or a hearty acceptance of it.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Mayhew has &s;uppo&s;ed and allowed this, thro' the whole cour&s;e of his arguments, and in all he &s;ays upon this &s;ubject, as the attentive reader has ob&s;erved.

<P>IF it &s;hould here be &s;aid, that tho' unregenerate &s;inners are not willing to accept of &s;alvation which is freely offered; and that this is both their &s;in and calamity: yet God may offer them <HI>regenerat|ing grace</HI>; and promi&s;e to bring them to a willing|ne&s;s
<PB N="92" REF="010007_0104_0F7B99152A29DA90">
to accept of &s;alvation, by giving them a new heart, upon terms which they, while unregene|rate, may come up to; and &s;o regeneration, and con&s;equently the whole of &s;alvation, may be con|nected with this condition, which really is &s;ome|thing &s;hort of a hearty acceptance of &s;alvation: for this is one thing promi&s;ed to be given, and is im|plied in regeneration.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer.</HI> If we &s;uppo&s;e the grace of regeneration or a new heart, which implies a heart to accept of and tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for &s;alvation, to be offered and promi&s;ed to the unregenerate, on &s;ome condition which they are to come up to and perform, while unregenerate; yet &s;till this is an offer of that to which their hearts are as much aver&s;e, as to &s;alva|tion it&s;elf: they are as far from accepting of &s;uch an offer, as they are from accepting of &s;alvation, and reject and de&s;pi&s;e it as much. The grace of rege|neration, or a new heart, is as contrary to the unre|generate heart, as &s;alvation or holine&s;s it&s;elf: the unregenerate do oppo&s;e and reject this with their whole hearts; for 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed their hearts are <HI>now</HI> in direct oppo&s;ition to the new heart offered; o|therwi&s;e they would &s;tand in no need of a <HI>new heart.</HI> If therefore God offers and promi&s;es to give them a new heart, on any condition, which con&s;i&s;ts in their exerci&s;e and doings, he makes this offer and promi&s;e to exerci&s;es and doings which imply, or are con&s;i&s;tent with, a real op|po&s;ition to, and rejection of, the thing offered and promi&s;ed. The unregenerate heart hates and op|po&s;es a <HI>new heart,</HI> ju&s;t as much as it does the di+vine character and law, or Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; and therefore is no more willing to receive
<PB N="93" REF="010007_0105_0F7B99159F942AE0">
the former than the latter, but rejects it with per|fect abhorence. Therefore there is nothing which the unregenerate may be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, in order to obtain a new heart, which is not it&s;elf an act of oppo&s;ition, or con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect op|po&s;ition to that which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;eek|ing. For in&s;tance: If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that God offers and promi&s;es to give the unregenerate, a new heart, on condition they will <HI>a&s;k</HI> him for &s;uch a favour: this mu&s;t mean an a&s;king without any true de&s;ire of the thing a&s;ked for; yea an a&s;k|ing which is con&s;i&s;tent with an oppo&s;ing and re|jecting the favor offered; and therefore really no a&s;king at all for a new heart, but for &s;omething el&s;e. For &s;o far as the new heart is oppo&s;ite to the heart of the unregenerate, ju&s;t &s;o far does the unregene|rate heart oppo&s;e and hate the new heart, and re|ject the offer of it; and that con&s;tantly, and in all its exerci&s;es which have any relation to, and re&s;pect the new heart, which is the thing offered.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that there is the &s;ame difficulty and ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that a new heart is of|fered and promi&s;ed to the doings of the unregene|rate, by which they would become willing to ac|cept of Chri&s;t and &s;alvation; as there is in &s;up|po&s;ing, that eternal life is offered on &s;ome condi|tion lower than a real willingne&s;s to accept of it.</P>
<P>In a word, if we will not go beyond rea&s;on and plain common &s;en&s;e in this matter, we &s;hall con|clude, that whatever offer of any favor or free gift God makes to men, he offers it to their free acceptance, and promi&s;es that on this condi|tion it &s;hall be their's: and con&s;equently that they can have no title to it, on any condition &s;hort of a
<PB N="94" REF="010007_0106_0F7B99162FCE01B0">
hearty acceptance of it: And that an offer made to a lower or ea&s;ier condition, cannot be rea&s;ona|bly de&s;ired, or even &s;uppo&s;ed. Therefore God in the go&s;pel makes no offers and promi&s;es of &s;alvati|on, or of any thing connected with it, to the ex|erci&s;es and doings of the unregenerate.</P>
<P>V. ARG. FOR God to offer and promi&s;e &s;alva|tion to tho&s;e who with their whole hearts hate and reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his character of Mediator, would be altogether unbecoming: and really in|con&s;i&s;tent with the go&s;pel, and overthrow it. The go&s;pel opens a way of &s;alvation for &s;inners <HI>through a Mediator</HI>; in which they are pardoned, and received to favor, and a title to everla&s;ting life, purely out of re&s;pect to his merits and worthine&s;s; &s;o on his account and in his name. And in this way alone can God pardon the &s;inner, receive him to fa|vour, and be&s;tow eternal life on him, con&s;i&s;tent with his honor and in a way becoming his charac|ter, as &s;upreme lawgiver and judge. But to pardon the &s;inner and receive him to favor, and promi&s;ie eternal life to him, while he remains an enemy to this Mediator, and oppo&s;es and rejects him in this charcter, would be to act directly contrary to this plan; and really to di&s;honor the mediator, and &s;et him a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Therefore in the go&s;pel &s;inners are repre&s;ented as being &s;aved (<HI>i. e.</HI> brought into a &s;tate of pardon and acceptance with God, and to a title to eternal life) <HI>by the blood of Chri&s;t</HI>; or by his merit and worthine&s;s being imputed to them, or reckoned to their account. Accordingly it is by virtue of their union to him, or being <HI>in him,</HI> that they are deli|vered

from condemnation, ju&s;tified, &amp;c. In this way God <HI>may be ju&s;t,</HI> may act a wi&s;e and honorable part, &s;o as in no degree to injure his own character as moral governor; even while <HI>he ju&s;tifies,</HI> par|dons and promi&s;es &s;alvation to, <HI>him who,</HI> though infinitely unworthy and ill-de&s;erving in him&s;elf, <HI>believeth in Je&s;us</HI> the Mediator: <HI>i. e.</HI> who, in a view of his true character, heartily approves and accepts of him, &s;o as actively to unite him&s;elf to him, and be <HI>in</HI> him.<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Rom.</HI> iii. 26. <HI>v.</HI> i, 2. viii <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> He being thus <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> a proper foundation is laid for his being in|tere&s;ted in the Mediator's merits and worthine&s;s; &s;o that he is received to favor and a title to eternal life purely out of re&s;pect to Him.

[P. 72, &amp;c] If truly holy actions might be done by men, and yet they continue out of Chri&s;t, and in oppo&s;ition to him, as the unregenerate do; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there would be no more rea&s;on why divine promi&s;es &s;hould be made to them, than to actions which are not holy: for all &s;inners, con&s;idered as out of Chri&s;t, or not united to him, &s;o as to be in|tere&s;ted in his merits, are on a level in this re&s;pect, whether holy or unholy; they are infinitely unworthy and ill de&s;erving, and cannot be received to favor with God, and a little to life, untill they are united to the Mediator, &s;o as to be intere&s;ted in this merit and worthine&s;s. If the doctor therefore repre&s;ents this objection in its full &s;trength and im|port, it mu&s;t be owned 'tis as <HI>feeble</HI> as he &s;uppo&s;es it to be. But if the objectors mean, that the unregenerate do nothing in that holy man|ner, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their hearts being united to Chri&s;t the Mediator, &s;o as to be a proper ground of their being accepted <HI>to him,</HI> the doctor has not in the lea&s;t degree an&s;wered the objection. There may be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why no promi&s;es &s;hould be made to the exerci&s;es of &s;inners, which have no degree of holine&s;s in them; viz becau&s;e &s;uch exerci&s;es do not unite to Chri&s;t, or imply any union of heart to him, but the contrary. It has been ob&s;erved, that the go&s;pel, or Chri&s;t and the way of &s;alvation by him, are &s;o holy, that the unho|ly heart cannot be plea&s;ed with, but mu&s;t hate and oppo&s;e them. There|fore that exerci&s;e of heart by which &s;inners embrace the go&s;pels or u|nite them&s;elves to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by an acceptance of him, mu&s;t be an <HI>holy</HI> exerci&s;e. In this view, 'tis unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that there are any promi&s;es of &s;alvation, made to the unholy doings of &s;in|ners; and therefore the objection &s;tands good. But there may be good rea&s;on why &s;alvation &s;hould be promi&s;ed to the holy exerci&s;es of the re|generate; becau&s;e, however imperfect they are, they are really an ac|ceptance of Chri&s;t, and unite them to him; &s;o that they lay a proper foundation for their being accepted <HI>in him,</HI> and receiving a title to the heavenly inheritance for his &s;ake: For, as the doctor well expre&s;&s;es it. "It is <HI>for Chri&s;t's &s;ake,</HI> that the&s;e promi&s;es are made to them." [P. 74.] But it has been &s;hewn, that &s;uch promi&s;es cannot be made <HI>for Chri&s;t's &s;ake,</HI> so the&s;e who hate end reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t: But if promi&s;es are made to &s;uch, heaven and Chri&s;t him&s;elf are promi&s;ed to them, for their own &s;akes, or rather, for the &s;ake of their own unholy, wicked exerci&s;es and doings.</P>
<P>The doctor indeed endeavours to palliate this matter a little [P. 73] What he &s;ays it to this effect, the temper and actions of his &s;trivers, are really different from tho&s;e who are proceeding headlong in their criminal cour&s;es and to &s;ay the lea&s;t, are not &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to God. And their doings may properly be called <HI>obedience</HI> to God; and there|fore have &s;omething of the nature of GOOD; and &s;o cannot be <HI>whol|ly</HI> unplea&s;ing to God. It mu&s;t therefore render them <HI>more &s;uitable</HI> ob|jects of his favor and mercy than the&s;e are, who do not &s;trive; but commit iniquity with greedine&s;s." The doctor &s;eems to be con&s;cious that there mu&s;t be &s;ome GOOD qualification in the &s;inner in order to render him a &s;uitable object of God's favor and mercy; otherwi&s;e he would not take &s;o much pains to find &s;omething of this kind in tho&s;e whom be &s;uppo&s;s the objects of this favor. But what does he mean by their being <HI>&s;uitable,</HI> or <HI>more &s;uitable objects of God's favor and mercy,</HI> antecedent to their union to Chri&s;t, and intere&s;t in his worthi|ne&s;s; and con&s;idered as in them&s;elves? Does he mean, there is a pro|per <HI> moral &s;uitablene&s;s</HI> or fitne&s;s; &s;ome moral excellency which recon|mends to God's favor, as a rea&s;on why they &s;hould have mercy rather than others? If this is the ca&s;e, then they need not the merit of Chri&s;t to recommend them to God's favor; for they have upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, merit enough of their own to an&s;wer this end. The doctor repeatedly di&s;claims the notion of merit; but if this is what he means, he holds to the doctrine of merit to all intents. If any &s;inner has any moral good or worth, which recommends him to the divine favor, on the account of its acceptablene&s;s in God's &s;ight, and on this account is a rea&s;on why God &s;hews favor to him rather than to another; he has as <HI>real</HI> merit, as 'tis po&s;&s;ible any creature &s;hould have, tho' it may not be to &s;o great a <HI>degree.</HI> But if by being a <HI>&s;uitsble, or fit object</HI> of God's favor he means any other kind of fitne&s;s, he would oblige us by &s;hewing what it is.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>ANS. This objection &s;eems to have its foundati|on in a &s;uppo&s;ition for which there is no ground, and is indeed directly contrary to the truth of the ca&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> that if &s;alvation is not offered and pro|mi&s;ed to the exerci&s;es and endeavours of unre|generate men, then it is offered to them on terms impracticable, though they are never &s;o well di&s;|po&s;ed, and have a good will in the ca&s;e; and &s;o are not, at all to blame for not coming up to the terms propo&s;ed; there being &s;ome difficulty in the ca&s;e which is in&s;urmountable, however good and great their inclination and de&s;ire may be to do it. As the objectors &s;eem to view the ca&s;e, it may be repre&s;ented by the following compari&s;on. A cer|tain lord, as he was vi&s;iting one of his plantations, &s;aw a large building on fire: and when he came to it, he. found a number of his &s;ervants confined in it. He knowing their &s;ituation, calls to them, tells them the dreadful ca&s;e they are in, and earne&s;tly calls upon them to ari&s;e and come to the door with a promi&s;e that upon their &s;o doing, he will unlock it, and deliver them. At the &s;ame time, both he and they know, that they are fa&s;tned down with chains which they have been trying with all Itheir might to deliver them&s;elves from; but find it impo&s;&s;ible. They cry to him for help,

and do their utmo&s;t, but all in vain: he &s;tands by, and &s;ees them peri&s;h in the devouring flames! Dr. Mayhew, repre&s;ents the &s;tate much in this light in many pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;ermons, as well as in the following words.

<P>I am as ready to confe&s;s, as the doctor that were the ca&s;e as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, there would be no goodne&s;s, or propriety in the offers of the go&s;pel. But in truth it is, as it were, infinitely otherwi&s;e. There is no difficulty in the &s;inner's complying with the offers of the go&s;pel, but what lies in his want of an inclination and true de&s;ire to accept the &s;alvation offered; and a &s;trong and ob&s;tinate incli|nation to the contrary. The ca&s;e really is, as if the above mentioned lord &s;hould find his &s;ervants in the hou&s;e con&s;uming by fire, confined by nothing but their own inclination and lu&s;t, all engaged in gaming and drinking. He opens the door and calls upon them to e&s;cape for their lives, and promi&s;es them that if they are willing to come to him, and engage in his &s;ervice, they &s;hall be &s;afe and happy. But they have &s;uch a di&s;like to his per&s;on and &s;er|vice, and are to attached to their gaming, &amp;c. that
<PB N="100" REF="010007_0112_0F7B991CEFFAF580">
they ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to comply with the propo&s;al. They had rather run the venture of peri&s;hing in the flames: and continue there under the repeated admonitions and calls of their kind lord, untill in|evitable de&s;truction comes upon them.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, 'That tho' this &s;imilitude may fitly repre&s;ent the ca&s;e of &s;inners, who pay no regard to the go&s;pel, but run with greedine&s;s in a cour&s;e of &s;in; yet the ca&s;e of convinced &s;inners, who are concerned about them&s;elves, and earne&s;t|ly &s;eeking deliverance, is different.' It may be ob&s;erved, that there is no material difference, &s;o as any way to affect the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration. The &s;inner, however exerci&s;ed and concerned he is about him&s;elf, and whatever pains he takes to better his ca&s;e, and obtain deliverance; if &s;till he does not actually accept of &s;alvation; does re|fu&s;e &s;o to do from the fixed oppo&s;ition of his heart, to the &s;alvation offered: which oppo&s;ition of heart is of the &s;ame nature and kind, with that of the &s;ecure &s;inner, and is really as voluntary, and eve|ry way as inexcu&s;able; and indeed is more appar|ent, and exerci&s;es it&s;elf in a &s;tronger manner, than that of the &s;ecure &s;inner; as the former actually re|&s;i&s;ts more light, and conviction of con&s;cience than the latter.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e two criminals, under confinement and &s;entence of death, for &s;ome trea&s;onable practices again&s;t their prince. The prince offers to pardon and re&s;tore them to his favor, if they will heartily repent, a&s;k his pardon, and &s;ubmit to his govern|ment and laws, as excellent and good. One of them pays no regard to the propo&s;al; but, uncon|cerned about what he has done, and what is com|ing

upon him, follows his cups, and does not &s;o much as &s;eriou&s;ly attend to the &s;ad ca&s;e he is in. The other thinks of the death that is before him with horror, and can neither eat nor &s;leep in peace: but, on the whole, cannot find in his heart to com|ply with the offer. The more he thinks of it, the more his heart ri&s;es again&s;t his prince. He cannot be willing to a&s;k his pardon, nor does he de&s;ire to live under his government and laws. He tries e|very way he can think of to e&s;cape death, &s;hort of complying with the&s;e terms. He &s;ends petitions every day and hour to his prince: hoping to gain his favor upon &s;ome other conditions. But the longer he tries, the more he is convinced that he mu&s;t peri&s;h, unle&s;s he heartily complies with the propo&s;als made him, and the more clearly he &s;ees and feels the oppo&s;ition of his heart thereto. Now which of the&s;e traitors is, on the whole, the greate&s;t criminal in the &s;ight of the prince? Does the latter do any thing that tends to recommend him to the prince? And if after all he dies, in con|&s;equence of his refu&s;ing to accept of the offered pardon and deliverance, is it any imputation on the goodne&s;s of the prince? or does it appear to be the le&s;s goodne&s;s in him, becau&s;e the traitor re|fu&s;ed to take the advantage of it? Let common &s;en&s;e decide the que&s;tion. And by this, the que&s;|tion before us will be decided.</P>
<P>The terms on which God offers pardon and &s;al|vation to, &s;inners, are not "to them impracticable tho' they de&s;ire it." They are no more imprac|ticable, and in no other &s;en&s;e, than are the terms on which pardon and &s;afety are offered by the prince to the traitor, in the in&s;tance mentioned.

<P>THE doctor &s;eems to think he has done much to &s;et the wonderful goodne&s;s and mercy of God in a clear and &s;tricking light, by proving that there are promi&s;es to the unregenerate. He therefore makes the following, which he calls an <HI>important</HI> inference. <Q>We &s;ee from hence the wonderful goodne&s;s and mercy of God; in as much as he has given us the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance of pardon and eternal life, on &s;uch terms as, by his of|fered grace we may all comply with, <HI>if we de|&s;ire to do it.</HI></Q><NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 77.</NOTE> With the doctor's good leave I will &s;ay, that the goodne&s;s and mercy of God ap|pears equally wonderful, on &s;uppo&s;ition there are no promi&s;es made to the doings of the uneregenerate. For even on this &s;uppo&s;ition, "he has given us the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of pardon and eternal life, on &s;uch terms as we may comply with if we re|ally de&s;ire it. I have therefore as good a right to this inference from my doctrine, as the doctor has from his. Yea I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, <HI>a much better.</HI> In this &s;entence the doctor &s;uppo&s;es that the terms on which pardon and &s;alvation are offered are &s;o difficult, that a real de&s;ire to comply with them, does not get over the difficulty: but there is yet need of God's "offered grace," to a&s;&s;i&s;t and help over that which is otherways in&s;uperable, by the be&s;t de&s;ire, and the utmo&s;t good will in the matter. Whereas, according to the doctrine he oppo&s;es, <HI>a real de&s;ire to comply,</HI> is the compliance
<PB N="104" REF="010007_0116_0F7B99234D7BC070">
it&s;elf; and is the condition on which pardon and &s;alvation are offered; there being no difficulty in coming up to the terms, but what there is in hav|ing a real de&s;ire and hearty good will, or a being truely willing to accept of pardon and &s;alvation. He who comes to this, has no need of any "of|fered grace" to help him to comply with the terms of &s;alvation, as the doctor &s;uppo&s;es; but has <HI>al|ready</HI> complied, and has pardon and &s;alvation in|&s;ured to him. If the doctor's &s;cheme then, &s;hews the "wonderful goodne&s;s and mercy of God," that which he oppo&s;es does &s;o, much more abun|dantly.</P>
<P>But what does the doctor mean by his "offered grace," to help tho&s;e to comply with the terms of &s;alvation, who "really de&s;ire to do it?" If there is <HI>a real de&s;ire to comply,</HI> the heart is <HI>really</HI> gained, and there is a real compliance of heart or will, and what more there is required as the condition of pardon and &s;alvation, in which the heart or will has no concern; and &s;o is not the compliance of the heart, but of &s;omething el&s;e; in order to which compliance we &s;tand in need of God's "offered grace," even when the heart has really complied; I &s;ay, what this is; and how God's "offered grace" helps to it, the doctor has not told, and I am not able to conceive. Untill the doctor &s;hall explain this matter, I &s;hall conclude, that there is no "offered grace" to enable men to comply with the terms of &s;alvation, who&s;e hearts do already re|ally comply, and yet can't comply, untill by this "offered grace" they come up to a compliance in which the heart is not concerned, it being &s;ome|thing more than, and different from a hearty com|pliance.
<PB N="105" REF="010007_0117_0F7B992411065278">
I believe, that no compliance with the terms of &s;alvation is required but an <HI>hearty com|pliance</HI>; and if men are by God's grace a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;uch a compliance, they have all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the ca&s;e, in order to obtain pardon; and therefore that God does not offer any other a&s;&s;&s;t|ance, in order to a compliance.</P>
<P>But let us attend a minute longer to this extraor|dinary pa&s;&s;age of the doctor's. He &s;ays, The won|derful goodne&s;s and mercy of God appears, "in as much as he has given us the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of pardon and eternal life, on &s;uch terms as, by his offered grace, we may all comply with, IF WE REALLY DESIRE TO DO IT." But what if we don't really de&s;ire to do it? Will this in the lea&s;t fully the goodne&s;s of God in making the offer on &s;uch low terms? The doctor &s;uppo&s;es, in his ve|ry putting the ca&s;e, it will not. What then if none of mankind will <HI>really de&s;ire</HI> to comply; or in o|ther words, really and heartily comply with the terms on which pardon and &s;alvation are offered, untill they are regenerated, and have a new heart given them?&mdash;Is not the goodne&s;s of God to be vindicated, and does it not appear to be wonder|ful, in offering pardon and eternal life to every one who is heartily willing and de&s;irous to have them, however far mankind may be from a heart to comply with this condition?</P>
<P>Dr. Mayhew him&s;elf, is as clear and full in this, as any one can be: as appears not only from pa&s;|&s;ages already quoted,<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>P.</HI> 102 <HI>marg.</HI></NOTE> but the following words of his, in the &s;ermons under con&s;ideration. <Q>He

To be &s;ure, it does not appear that a belief that the endeavours of the unregenerate are connected with &s;alvation has any &s;uch influence on per&s;ons to excite and en|courage them earne&s;tly to attend on the means of grace and &s;alvation, as that they who believe this to be true, evidently di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from others in their endeavours. And where this doc|trine is preached up mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly and con&s;tant|ly, it does not appear to have any &s;en&s;ible effect, to rou&s;e and engage &s;inners to zeal and earne&s;t|ne&s;s it this matter. Such congregations don't ap|pear to be more engaged and painful in the things of religion than others, where the contrary doc|trine is preached. But if there is any vi&s;ible dif|ference in this re&s;pect, it is directly the rever&s;e of this. And wherever there have been the mo&s;t remarkable vi&s;ible in&s;tances of &s;inners being awak|ened to a &s;uitable concern about their &s;ouls, and a great and con&s;tant engagedne&s;s in attending on means, it has been under the preaching, which is in the whole tenor of it incon&s;i&s;tent with the no|tion, of there being promi&s;es made to the doings of

unregenerate &s;inners: and all their concern and earne&s;t endeavours have taken place, and continue, under a firm belief of the contrary doctrine.</P>
<P>Now, if it appears from fact and experience, that the doctrine which a&s;&s;erts that there are no promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate, is not matter of di&s;couragement to any in con&s;tantly and earne&s;tly attending on means; and that the oppo&s;ite doctrine does not influence, to &s;tir men up and put them forward in taking pains in this matter; but rather has a contrary influence: have we not rea|&s;on to conclude, that the objection is groundle&s;s, however well &s;upported by good rea&s;on, the ob|jector may think it to be?</P>
<P>It appears from fact, that &s;inners under the go&s;|pel more commonly neglect the proper means of grace and &s;alvation, live in &s;ecuriy and &s;loth, and &s;o finally mi&s;cary, from pre&s;umption, than from de|&s;pair; or for want of greater encouragement and hope. And when they do de&s;pair, &s;o as in any degree to di&s;courage them, and prevent their engaged, re|&s;olute, painful endeavours, this is never grounded on their &s;uppo&s;ing that there are no promi&s;es to their doings; but upon &s;ome delu&s;ion. What &s;e|cure &s;inners under the go&s;pel who are neglecting the means of &s;alvation, want, in order to their be|ing engaged in this matter, is to have their <HI>fears</HI> excited, and not their hope.

They &s;tand in need of having their fears excited, by a &s;ight of the dangerous and awful &s;tate they are in. And when they have any degree of a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of this, they will &s;till have all the hope that is con&s;i&s;tent with

They therefore who make this ob|jection, &s;eem not only to have overlooked matter of fact, but not to attend to human nature, in its natural operations in a &s;tate of unregeneracy: and therefore attempt to argue, not only again&s;t all ex|perience: but in in direct oppo&s;ition to rea&s;on and the nature of things.</P>
<P>But I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THE doctrine that the doings of the unre|generate are connected with &s;alvation, as it is preached up by tho&s;e who hold it, is &s;o far from containing in it more encouragement to them than the oppo&s;ite doctrine, that it tends greatly to <HI>di&s;|courage</HI> &s;inners, who are in any good mea&s;ure ac|quainted with them&s;elves, and even to throw them into de&s;pair.</P>

[P. 20.] He &s;ays, <Q>The &s;triving here enjoined, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to intend &s;triving with <HI>per&s;everace</HI>; not for a month a year, or any definite given time; <HI>but as long as it &s;hall plea&s;e God to conclude us in the world.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this it may be ob&s;erved, That if any are regenerated before they die, or in this life, God does not grant them this favor, and give them a new heart, in fulfilment of any promi&s;e to their doing; or &s;trivings, or becau&s;e there is any connection between their &s;trivings, and this gift of a new heart. For if no &s;triving entitles to any promi&s;e, but that which continues to the end of life, even to the la&s;t breath, then if a new heart and an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t is given <HI>before the end of life,</HI> it is given not as a promi&s;ed mercy; and therefore not out of re&s;pect to any endeavours of the &s;inner, or becau&s;e they have any connection with it. Therefore they who are regenerated, and became true chri&s;tians in this life, do not obtain it by their &s;triving, as having any connection with it; but they become &s;o by the unpromi&s;ed &s;overeign mercy of God. If therefore all who are &s;aved are regenerated, or obtain a new heart, and become real, true Chri&s;tians in this life, then they are all brought into a &s;tate of &s;alvation, have a &s;ure title to life, and are intere&s;ted in all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, not by virtue of their unregenerate &s;trivings, <HI>but before</HI> they obtain any title to God's favor by the&s;e; becau&s;e 'tis <HI>before</HI> they have per&s;evered therein to the end of life.</P>
<P>The doctor's promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate, and their certain connection with &s;alvation, do at length then turn out to be promi&s;es that are never fulfilled or rather no promi&s;es at all; and a connection which is of no avail; but is con&s;i&s;tent with their being eternally lo&s;t. For notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e promi&s;es and this connection, they mu&s;t go out of the world unregenerate, or in their &s;ins; becau&s;e they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the promi&s;es, and the connection does not take place, while they are in this life; as the condition is not fulfilled till the la&s;t breath. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they go out of the world unregenerate, they mu&s;t be damned, un|le&s;s they are regenerated, and became true chri&s;tian in the other world, or after death</P>
<P>Therefore if any hope to obtain a new heart, and become real chri&s;tians in this life, they can according to the doctor's plan have no encouragement to &s;trive under the notion of doing that with which &s;uch a &s;avor is con|nected, but mu&s;t &s;eek it as an unpromi&s;ed, &s;overeign mercy. And they only can be encouraged by the doctor's promi&s;es, who are willing to wait for a new heart till After they are dead; that is, till it is eternally too late to obtain it, according to the divine con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The doctor having ob&s;erved that all per&s;ons tho' unregenerate, who de&s;re &s;alvation and &s;trive in order thereto, &s;hall be &s;aved, unle&s;s they cea&s;e thus to de&s;ire and &s;trive, adds the following words [P. 56, 57] <Q>Not to be &s;ure, without being born of God; but they &s;hall be <HI>renewed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of their minds,</HI> and con&s;equently enter into life.</Q> If they are born of God in this life, or while "It &s;hall plea&s;e God to con|tinue them in this world," they receive this favor <HI>before</HI> they have ful|filed the condition of it, and therefore not as what they have a title to by promi&s;e, for they have not yet fulfilled the condition, which is per|&s;everence in &s;triving <HI>to the end of life.</HI> If they &s;hall be born of God, and renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds after they are gone out of this world, and &s;o out of the body, this is a new doctrine which has hither|to been thoug of contrary to &s;cripiture. In one word,</P>
<P>The doctor &s;uppo&s;es that all who have a new heart given them, receive it as a favor, promi&s;ed to their &s;eeking and &s;triving. But in order to their being entitle to this promi&s;e, they mu&s;t &s;eek and &s;trive as long as they are in the world. Therefore, according to him, none are regene|rated, and made new creatures in this world; but this work is in all ca&s;es put off till after men are dead: So there never was a regenerate per&s;on or real chri&s;tian in this life.</P></NOTE> And he who does not do all this, is &s;o far from being in the way to &s;alvation, that he will certainly be lo&s;t: and therefore can have no rea&s;onable hope of mercy.</P>

So the doctrine that teaches him, he mu&s;t thus di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf or peri&s;h, will be &s;o far from comforting and encouraging him, that it tends only to di&s;courage him: it will be like &s;inging &s;ongs to a heavy heart; and if believed, will certainly deprive him of all hope. The only doctrine that can give &s;upport and hope to &s;uch a &s;inner, and encourage him to attend on means is, <HI>that God has mercy on whom he will have mercy</HI>; and therefore waits not to have &s;inners di&s;tingui&s;h, and recommend them&s;elves to him as more &s;uita|ble objects of his mercy than others, before he will grant them mercy: but in &s;hewing mercy acts as being infinitely above all obligations to any, and as having no regard to worthine&s;s, or le&s;s unworthi|ne&s;s, as what recommends one to his favor, rather then another. This being the ca&s;e, the greate&s;t &s;inner; he who looks on him&s;elf the farthe&s;t from righteou&s;ne&s;s of any, and him&s;elf to be the mo&s;t guilty and unworthy, may hope in the u&s;e of means: and this is his only &s;upport.</P>

<P>IT may &s;till remain a doubt with &s;ome, whether there is really any ground of encouragement for men, e&s;pecially the unregenerate, to u&s;e means to obtain &s;alvation: Or, If there be any, what it is.

<P>QUEST. I. WHAT are the means of grace and &s;alvation; and what it meant by u&s;ing the&s;e means?</P>
<P>QUEST. II. WHY are means to be u&s;ed, and what end does this an&s;wer? And what motive and encouragement is there to this?</P>

<P><PB N="118" REF="010007_0130_0F7B992FAEB46FA8">QUEST. I. What are the means of grace and &s;alvation; and what is meant by u&s;ing the&s;e means?</P>
<P>ANS. THE means of grace and &s;alvation may be con&s;idered as including every thing which is a|dapted and tends to communicate light and truth, re&s;pecting the things of a moral nature, to the mind of man; or to lead his mind to attend to truth, and to excite tho&s;e ideas which are nece&s;&s;a|ry or proper, in order to right exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The grand medium of grace and &s;alvation, and &s;trictly &s;peaking, the &s;ole medium, is TRUTH. It is in the view of this that the mind exerci&s;es it|&s;elf properly, and has true enjoyment. This is the food and life of the mind: Was there no truth, there could be no virtue, or real happine&s;s. As &s;in and mi&s;ery con&s;i&s;t &s;ummarily in the darkne&s;s of the mind, and its alienation from, and oppo&s;ition to light and truth; &s;o all true holine&s;s, and proper mental enjoyment, con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e exerci&s;es which are implied and involved in a proper view and &s;en&s;e of truth; the truth, I mean, which relates to God's moral government and kingdom.</P>
<P>But then, all tho&s;e things, tho&s;e in&s;titutions and exerci&s;es, which tend to in&s;truct mankind in the knowledge of truth; to excite the attention; to convey truth to the mind, and hold it up in its view: all the&s;e, I &s;ay, are in a more remote &s;en&s;e the means of grace and &s;alvation. Such are all tho&s;e things, tho&s;e circum&s;tances and events in the natural and moral world, which are adapted to in|&s;truct mankind. Such, in a &s;pecial manner is di|vine revelation; and all tho&s;e in&s;titutions and ap|pointments therein, to be attended on by men.
<PB N="119" REF="010007_0131_0F7B993117525258">
Such are reading the bible, public and private in|&s;tructions, religious conver&s;ation, &s;erious medita|tion on divine things, &amp;c. and particularly PRAY|ER, which is the mo&s;t &s;olemn way of meditating on divine truth, as it is done as in the pre&s;ence of of God, and in a &s;olemn addre&s;s to him, and has a &s;pecial and peculiar tendency to awaken, in&s;truct and affect the mind.</P>
<P>USING the&s;e means intends two things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>I. Taking methods with men to &s;et truth be|fore them and in&s;truct them, and awaken their at|tention. Thus God is u&s;ing means with men in his providence, which is every way calculated to give in&s;truction to a &s;inful world. But more e|&s;pecially by giving the revelation which is contain|ed in the bible; and ordering it to be publi&s;hed and preached to the world. And according to di|vine in&s;titution, men are u&s;ing means with others for their &s;alvation, by public and private in&s;truc|tions, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Per&s;ons them&s;elves attending on the&s;e means. This is &s;uppo&s;ed in the u&s;e of means, ju&s;t men|tioned: for if there were none to attend on means, there would be no &s;uch thing as u&s;ing means with any, for their in&s;truction.

God's u&s;ing means with men for their in&s;truction and &s;alvation, and directing men to u&s;e means with others, &s;uppo&s;es the propriety and impor|tance of attending on the&s;e means.

The propriety and rea&s;onablene&s;s of taking any pains or method to in&s;truct men, or u&s;ing any means with them to this end, &s;uppo&s;es it proper and rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould give all that at|tention, and take all tho&s;e pains, which are nece&s;|&s;ary in order to be under the be&s;t advance to get the in&s;truction given.

<P>It has has been ob&s;erved that the end of u&s;ing or attending on the means of grace is in&s;tructu&s;ing or ther to lead the mind to the knowledge of that truth which it was before ignorant of, or to renew the attention to truth already known, and fix the mind upon it. The que&s;tion now is, What end this in&s;truction an&s;wers; Of what advantage is it to have the truth &s;et before the mind; and to have the attention of the mind fixed upon it?</P>
<P>ANS. THE benefit, advantage and importance of this to men, is ju&s;t as great as that of an external, divine revalation. For divine revelation is of &s;er|vice to men no further than it is attended to and under&s;tood. The world is as well without it, as with it, if no in&s;truction is given; but this in|&s;truction comes only by attending to the things revealed, in the u&s;e of means. If therefore the revelation which God has made in the bible, is a|dapted to be of any benefit to mankind, with re|&s;pect to their eternal &s;alvation; it is of equal be|nefit to mankind to attend to this revelation, in the diligent u&s;e of all proper means; that hereby they may get and retain the in&s;truction given therein: for without this it will certainly be in vain to them. A revelation not under&s;tood, is of no more advantage than no-revelation at all. There|fore

<P>In order to the &s;alvation of men, it is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould have the ideas and knowledge of tho&s;e things which relate to this &s;al|vation, and in which it con&s;i&s;ts. He who has no idea in his mind of any thing, is not capable of a|ny exerci&s;e of heart, or of any mental enjoyment. No man is capable of any exerci&s;e about that of which he has no idea or knowledge. It is im|po&s;&s;ible that a man &s;hould repent, and believe the go&s;pel, &s;o long as he has no knowledge of tho&s;e truths, in the view of which, repentance and faith are exerci&s;ed.

<P>There are but two po&s;&s;ible ways in which the knowledge of the truths, which are nece&s;&s;ary to be known in order to &s;alvation, can be obtained, viz. by <HI>immediate</HI> revelation, or in&s;piration; or by an external mediate one, or by means The latter is the way which God has taken to &s;et the&s;e truths before the mind.

<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that I am now &s;peaking of that knowledge which the mind is capable of, in|dependent of any degree of right ta&s;te or di&s;po&s;iti|on of the heart, or which the mind may have with|out di&s;cerning and reli&s;hing the beauty of divine things: And is what is commonly meant by <HI>&s;pe|culative</HI> or doctrinal knowledge.

The awakened, convinced &s;inner, who has taken a great deal of pains in the u&s;e of means, and has hereby got a great degree of in&s;truction and know|ledge, and yet continues impenitent, is in this re|&s;pect much more guilty and vile, and a greater cri|minal in God's &s;ight, than if he had never attain|ed to this conviction and knowledge: For now he is guilty of the abu&s;e of, and oppo&s;ition to, all this light and knowledge, which he could not be, while he had it not.

<P>As he who has no doctrinal acquaintance with the truths contained in God's word, is not in a ca|pacity to exerci&s;e any chri&s;tian grace or virtue, whatever foundation there might be for this in the renovation of his mind by regeneration, no one has rea&s;on to expect that his heart will be thus renewed by the &s;pirit of God, while he is in this ca&s;e.

<P>And as the ca&s;e is in a great degree the &s;ame with tho&s;e under the go&s;pel, who have never attended, to it in earne&s;t, they have no rea&s;on to expect to become new creatures by God's regenerating in|fluences, &s;o long as they are in this &s;ituation.

for the exerci&s;e and &s;upport of the divine life: And none have any rea&s;on to expect it will be implanted, or a new heart given, while the man is in &s;uch a &s;tate.</P>
<P>When God created man, he did not fir&s;t form him while the earth was in its chaotic &s;tate, when it was without form, and void and darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep: he did not create him with all his bodily &s;en&s;es and appetites, before there were any objects towards wnich they might exerci&s;e them&s;elves in a manner proper to man's nature, and &s;o as to &s;upport and promote ani|mal life, and afford proper enjoyment and hap|pine&s;s. He did not form an eye before there was any light, or objects to be beheld: He did not produce animal life, dependant on food for its con|&s;tant &s;upport and exerci&s;e, and an appetite for that food, before any materials were made, to become proper food, &s;uited to the appetite, and to &s;up|port and nouri&s;h life. He did not form man be|fore he had provided any place for his &s;ub&s;i&s;ting and exerci&s;ing him&s;elf in a manner proper and &s;uited to his nature. No: He <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ceated an external world, a proper dwelling place for man, furni&s;hed with materials &s;uited to the &s;en&s;es; appetites and life of &s;uch a creature; that there might be a foundation and opportunity for proper exerci&s;es and enjoy|ments, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be created. And we he|&s;itate not to &s;ay, that this was agreeable to wi&s;dom; and that the contrary would not be &s;o.</P>
<P>So in the new creation, God will not form the new creature where there is no proper provi&s;ion, where there are no materials for the life and &s;up|port of the new man, &s;o no opportunity to act,
<PB N="132" REF="010007_0144_0F7B993ED8C0C2F0">
and to act in a manner proper and &s;uitable to his na|ture. But proper materials for this new life mu&s;t fir&s;t be provided. The mind mu&s;t be properly &s;tored with &s;peculative ideas of divine things, and the judgment convinced of the truth; in order to which the man mu&s;t be all attention to the&s;e things in a &s;en&s;e of their high importance to him, as his whole, his eternal intere&s;t turns upon them.

The only likely way for the &s;inner to be|come the &s;ubject of a &s;piritual re&s;urrection, is to have this taken away, by becoming all attention to the things contained in God's word. And the more in&s;truction the &s;inner has, the more fully and clearly he is convinced of tho&s;e truths which do mo&s;t nearly concern him; and the more con|&s;tantly and earne&s;tly he attends to divine truth by hearing, reading, meditation, prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the more his mind is impre&s;&s;ed and affected with it, as the minds of the unregenerate may be; the more hope there is in his ca&s;e; the more likely it

the things relating to the kingdom of God than they. The former attended &s;o con&s;tant|ly, and were &s;o much in his company, that it was made an objection again&s;t him, and he was oblig|ed often to vindicate his conduct with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>It therefore appears from fact and experience that they are in the mo&s;t likely way to be &s;aved, who attend on the means of grace And when the matter is attended to, the rea&s;on of this may ea&s;ily be &s;een, as has been &s;hewn above. We therefore now &s;ee what advantage there is in at|tendance on means, and what is the proper motive aid encouragement thereto. When any one at|tends to his eternal intere&s;t, and feels the infinite importance of it to him, and at the &s;ame time &s;ees the undone, wretched &s;tate he is in as a &s;inner, he will with all his might pur&s;ue that method which appears mo&s;t likely to obtain deliverance from the evil he fears, and promote this intere&s;t. Let the only way be pointed out to him in which he may have hope, and he will want no farther motive and encouragement to attend to it with re&s;olution and earne&s;tne&s;s. This will prove, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, a &s;ufficient motive and encouragement, and will ne|ver fail effectually to influence the per&s;on who is &s;en&s;ible his <HI>all</HI> lies at &s;take, and enters into the in|finite importance of the matter to him. If there|fore any &s;it &s;till in the neglect of the means of grace, it is not owing to any deficiency in the encourage|ment to attend upon them; but to &s;tupidity with regard to their own ca&s;e, and their eternal intere&s;t. And if this encouragement is not effectual, no ima|ginable, or even po&s;&s;ible, encouragement would be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="010007_0147_0F7B9941B466AC40">IF any &s;hould &s;ay, that promi&s;es to the &s;inner's endeavours and per&s;evering attendance on means, would rai&s;e the encouragement much higher: for then there would be no di&s;couragement, but an ab&s;folute certainty of &s;ucceeding in ihis way; the following particulars may perhaps &s;erve to di&s;cover their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I. If there were &s;uch promi&s;es made, the &s;fin|ner would be &s;o far from being ab&s;olutely certain of &s;alvation in a way of attendance on means, that the probability, in his view, and his encourage|ment would not be at all increa&s;ed hereby. And that for two rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;inner could never come to any certain|ty that he had fulfiled the condition to which the promi&s;e is made, or that he is in a likely way to fulfil it. 1. Becau&s;e he could never be certain that he had come up to that <HI>preci&s;e</HI> degree of earne&s;t &s;triving and diligent attendance on means, to which the promi&s;e is made.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Indeed he may be <HI>certain,</HI> as long as he lives, that he has not yet fulfilled the condition; becau&s;e he has not attained to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> &s;o long as he has one breath more &s;o draw, however great the degree of his endeavours now are. The &s;inner therefore can be very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> regements from &s;uch a promi&s;e of being delivered from the mi&s;erable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of unregenerates, and becoming a true chri&s;tian, in this life as has been before ob&s;erved. And this is the &s;ame with no encouragement at all.</NOTE> If there are any promi&s;es made to the doings of the unregenerate, they are made not to any <HI>certain kind</HI> of exerci&s;es and en|deavours, &s;o that the lowe&s;t degree of this kind of &s;eeking intitles to the promi&s;e, but to a <HI>certain degree</HI> of this kind, which is not, neither can be preci&s;ely pointed out, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;ome lower degree, to which the promi&s;e is not made, &s;o that the &s;inner can ever be certain that he has attained
<PB N="136" REF="010007_0148_0F7B994270BC6120">
to that degree. And however near he comes to it, if he, after all, finally falls &s;hort in the lea&s;t de|gree, he is as far from &s;alvation, in this way, as if he had done nothing. This therefore would tend to perplex, rather than incourage the &s;inner. Yea, the &s;inner who has the cleare&s;t view of the viciou&s;ne&s;s of his own heart, and the greate&s;t &s;en&s;e of the reallity and importance of eternal things, will be farthe&s;t from imagining that he has attain|ed to that degree of earne&s;tne&s;s of endeavour to which the promi&s;e is made: and will be mo&s;t ready to conclude again&s;t him&s;elf, as being a &s;tu|pid, indolent, &s;otti&s;h wretch, and de&s;pair of ever obtaining &s;alvation in this way. But,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If the &s;inner could be certain that he has attained to that degree of earne&s;tne&s;s of endea|vour which will intitle him to the promi&s;e, if he <HI>per&s;everes</HI> in it: yet he can have no certainty of per&s;evering, &s;o no certainty of &s;alvation. As his per&s;everance depends wholly on him&s;elf, his own will and re&s;olution, and &s;o he has nothing to rely upon but him&s;elf for it, 'tis the mo&s;t uncertain thing in the world that he &s;hall per&s;evere. He can have confidence in nothing, in this ca&s;e, but his own deceitful heart which is indeed only the confidence and pre&s;umption of a <HI>fool</HI>: for "he that tru&s;teth in his own heart is a tool."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> xxviii. 26.</NOTE> If he is &s;ufficiently in earne&s;t and painful in his endea|vours for &s;ome time; yet if after all that, he is in any degree remi&s;s and negligent one day, or but one hour, all is lo&s;t, and he has got all to begin again; for he has failed of per&s;everance. And
<PB N="137" REF="010007_0149_0F7B99432F6C4DF8">
how does he know that it is not now eternally too late! So that his &s;alvation, on this footing, is the mo&s;t uncertain, precarious thing in the world: or rather may mo&s;t rea&s;onably be de&s;paired of. He who knows his own heart, &s;o far as he who is un|der proper, geneuine convictions does, can take no encouragement from this quarter. This is &s;uit|ed only to flatter and bol&s;ter up the unrea&s;onably &s;elf confident and fool-hardy. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Such promi&s;es, were there any, would only tend to encourage men in a &s;elf confidence, which is as oppo&s;ite to the whole tenor of divine revela|tion, and the peculiar genius and glory of the go&s;|pel, as darkne&s;s is to light; &s;o that the more the &s;inner has of it, the farther he is from Chri&s;t, and the more blind to the way of &s;alvation by him. The preaching up &s;uch promi&s;es therefore, will tend to fix per&s;ons in their &s;elf confidence and de|lu&s;ion, who have no good degree of genuine con|viction of their &s;inful, mi&s;erable &s;tate, and to fa&s;t|en them down in ea&s;e and &s;ecurity; &s;o to pervert the benefit of the means of grace and fru&s;trate the great end and de&s;ign of them, which is to give light and in&s;truction to the &s;inner. But to tho&s;e who are in any mea&s;ure convinced of their true &s;tate; &s;o know how little depandence there is on them&s;elves, how vile and fotti&s;h their hearts are, this doctrine will give no encouragement: but will have directly the contrary influence on them, if they can be made to believe it, as has been before &s;hewn.</P>
<P>QUEST. III. WHAT obligations are men under to u&s;e means?</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="010007_0150_0F7B994453B4D0A8">ANS. THEY &s;eem to be under the &s;ame obliga|tions to this, as they are to repent and believe the go&s;pel. If God commands all men every where to repent, then he requires of them all that is impli|ed in, or is nece&s;&s;ary in order to, repentance. He therefore requires of them to under&s;tand tho&s;e truths which are nece&s;&s;ary to be known in order to repentance: con&s;equently requires all that attenti|on to the things contained in divine revelation, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to under&s;tand tho&s;e truths, a right &s;peculative knowledge of which is implied in repentance. But this implies a diligent u&s;e of the means of grace, as has been &s;hewn. A neglect of any of tho&s;e things, which are im|plied in, or nece&s;&s;ary in order to repentance, is a neglect of, and oppo&s;ition to, the command to repent; &s;o a counteracting and violating our obliga|tions to repent. But he is guilty of this, who ne|glects the means of grace. It has been &s;hewn that there is a certain degree of &s;peculative knowledge nece&s;&s;ary in order to exerci&s;e repentance, which they never have who live in the neglect of all means of grace. Therefore the command to repent, is a command to attend all tho&s;e means nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to attain that knowledge. If men are under a|ny obligation to attend to the command to repent and be converted, or to obey this command, they are under obligation to all that, which is implied in this, or nece&s;&s;ary on their parts in order to it: therefore are under obligation to hear and attend to the truths contained in God's word, with the ut|mo&s;t concern and diligence.</P>
<P>The preaching the go&s;pel therefore, which is the &s;ame with a testifying to all men repentance
<PB N="139" REF="010007_0151_0F7B9944C13C8358">
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; is a call unto all to hearken and attend, as this is implied in repentance and faith. But to hearken and attend, implies the whole that is in|tended by the u&s;e of means. Therefore if any preacher of the go&s;pel doubts whether he has any warrant to call upon and exhort &s;inners to attend the means of grace; he appears not well to under|&s;tand what he is about: for he is really doing this, while he is calling upon and exhorting them to re|pent and believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>THEY</HI> are indeed <HI>already</HI> attending on means, while he is preaching the go&s;pel to them. This is &s;uppo&s;ed; for if they give no attention to what he &s;ays, why does he &s;peaks? Every word he &s;ays, is in effect a call attend And his manife&s;ting his intention to preach in any future time, is a call upon them to attend. For if their attending is not rea|&s;onable and important, there is no rea&s;on in his.preaching; &s;o his in|tention to do it is fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd: con&s;equently his doing it <HI>now</HI> is &s;o In this view then he tho undertakes to preach the go&s;pel; and yet holds that &s;inners are not to he called up a to attend means, is guilty of a glaring ab&s;urdity.</NOTE></P>
<P>And it may be here ob&s;erved, that this is the &s;criptural way of calling upon men to attend means, viz. to call on them to repent and believe the go&s;|pel. And they who &s;o far attend to this call as to feel the infinite importance to them&s;elves that they &s;hould comply with it, will of cour&s;e, and of their own accord go into a diligent u&s;e of means. Many public teachers therefore &s;eem to make a great mi&s;|take here. In&s;tead of calling upon all to repent and believe the go&s;pel, as the only condition of God's favor and eternal life, the mo&s;t they do, with relation to unregenerate &s;inners, is to exhort and urge them to the&s;e doings which are &s;hort of
<PB N="140" REF="010007_0152_0F7B99456DFBE960">
repentance. They teach them to u&s;e means in &s;uch a manner, as rather tends to defeat the pro|per end of means, and &s;o as that they become a means of blinding their eyes, rather then of in|truction; it tends to lead them to re&s;t in means, and make a Saviour of them; to quiet and heal them &s;hort of repentance, and a &s;aving application to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>OBJ. Whatever obligations &s;inners are under to attend the means of grace: yet if they attend, they &s;till &s;in in all they do, while they continne impenitent, yea they are con&s;tantly growing wor&s;e and more guilty, the more pains they take, and as light and conviction increa&s;e. What obligati|ons do they then fulfil? And is not this &s;ufficient matter of di&s;couragement?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I. They do not properly fulfil their obli|gations, if they &s;top &s;hort of true repentance, or real holine&s;s; for nothing &s;hort of this is true obe|dience to God's law. Neverthele&s;s, a neglect of the means is an in&s;tance of the violation of the obligation they are under, which they are not guil|ty of who do attend with concern and engaged|ne&s;s, however guilty and vile they may be in other re&s;pects; which guilt and vilene&s;s may be greatly aggravated by their attendance on means. If a man forbear to kill his neighbour, certainly he does not violate the obligations he is under not to kill, as he does who takes away his neighbour's life, how|ever far he may be from any true love to his neigh|bour, or obedience to any of God's commands; and though he may, on the whole, be more guil|ty than the murtherer.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="010007_0153_0F7B9949C93D6EC8">If a father calls after, and commands his two &s;ons, who are running from him, with a de&s;ign to quit his family and government, as what they per|fectly hate, immediately to return back, and &s;ub|mit them&s;elves to his authority: If they ought to obey their father's command, then they are un|der obligation to &s;top and attend to what he has to &s;ay; for this is implied in what he requires, and nce&s;&s;ary in order to it. Therefore if one turn a|bout and attend to what his father has to &s;ay to him, while the other &s;tops his ears, and runs on till he is out of hearing, the former does not vio|late the obligation to &s;top and hearken, which the latter does, though if he continues to hate his fa|ther, and refu&s;es to return and &s;ubmit to his govern|ment, he cannot be &s;aid to obey his father's com|mand; and may, by the light and conviction laid before him by his father, in con&s;equence of his flopping and attending, be more guilty in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit <HI>to him than</HI> the other who has been out of hearing.</P>
<P>And if any by-&s;tander, who &s;ees them running; oft, &s;hould tell them to &s;top and hear what their father &s;ays, he would herein act a friendly part both to them and their father, and perfectly coincide with his command to them to return and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to him. Indeed, if he &s;hould inculcate this upon them &s;o as to leave their father's com|mand to return, &amp;c. out of view, dwelling on this as if it was the only thing that they had to do: Or as what would on the whole recommend them to their father, and intere&s;t them in his fa|vour; or render them le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to him, tho', after all, they per&s;i&s;ted in their refu&s;al to return
<PB N="142" REF="010007_0154_0F7B994A52020028">
and &s;ubmit to him. I &s;ay, if he &s;hould treat the matter &s;o, it would be &s;o far from vindicating the father's authority, and coinciding with his com|mand, that he might ju&s;tly look upon it at taking part with his rebellious &s;ons, &s;etting up again&s;t him, and flattering them to their own ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> II. However &s;inful and abominable in God's fight the impenitent are in all they do, even in attendance on the means of grace, their &s;inful|ne&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t meerly in this; it does not con&s;i&s;t in their concern about their eternal intere&s;t: in their dread of mi&s;ery, and de&s;ire to e&s;cape it, and obtain happine&s;s, nor in their u&s;ing means in order to this, in reading, hearing praying, &amp;c. but in their impenitency, in the oppo&s;ition of their hearts to holine&s;s, and the only way of &s;alva|tion; and in tho&s;e things which are the attendants and con&s;equence of this, or in the want of their oppo&s;ites, with which all their exerci&s;es are attend|ed, and therefore very criminal. But this can be no rea&s;on why they &s;hould neglect the proper means of &s;alvation. If "the plowing of the wicked is &s;in," &s;hall they therefore not-plow? Shall they not de&s;ire food for them&s;elves and their families, and take the mo&s;t likely method to obtain it?&mdash;Their &s;in does not con&s;i&s;t meerly in their plowing, &s;o that it would be a le&s;s &s;in not to plow, than to do it; but in the wrong views and exerci&s;es of mind with which they plow, and in the want of right ones.</P>
<P>And if by attending, praying, reading, hear|ing, &amp;c. the impenitent &s;inner grows more crimi|nal and vile, as his light and conviction increa&s;es this is not properly owing to u&s;e of means; but to
<PB N="143" REF="010007_0155_0F7B994B385CF480">
to the rooted viciou&s;ne&s;s of the heart. The at|tendance on means is indeed the occa&s;ion of it, as by this, greater light and conviction takes place in the mind: and the wickedne&s;s of the heart takes occa&s;ion by this light to exert it&s;elf with a high|er hand, and more ob&s;tinately.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> III. The &s;inner's growing no better, but re|ally wor&s;e, more guilty and vile, the more light he has and the greater advantages he enjoys, while he continues impenitent, is really no matter of di&s;couragement from attending means in order to get light and in&s;truction, &amp;c. For in the go&s;pel there is no more encouragement given to a le&s;s &s;in|ner than to a greater; that he &s;hall find mercy ra|ther than the other, while both continue impeni|tent, and oppo&s;ers of the way of &s;alvation therein revealed. No one &s;inner has any rea&s;on to hope that he &s;hall be &s;aved rather than an other, becau&s;e he has not been, or is not now, &s;o great a &s;inner as others, while he is impenitent, and at heart an enemy to the go&s;pel. Never did a &s;inner find acceptance with God, on account of the compari|tive &s;mallne&s;s of his &s;ins, or his reformations, which were &s;hort of an hearty compliance with the go&s;|pel. We indeed read of one who took his encour|agement that God would accept and favor him, from his imagining him&s;elf not &s;o criminal and vile as others. But what was the con&s;eqnence? He was rejected: While one who took his encourage|ment to hope for God's mercy quite from another quarter, and which was con&s;i&s;tent with his view|ing him&s;elf as the chief of &s;inners, found favor.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Luke</HI> xviii. 9-14.</NOTE>
<PB N="144" REF="010007_0156_0F7B994B8642DC08">
The go&s;pel offers &s;alvation to the greate&s;t &s;inners: they are as welcome as any other; they are as ac|ceptable to God, and he is as ready to be&s;tow &s;al|vation upon them, as if their &s;ins were not &s;o ma|ny and great, if they will heartily embrace offered mercy, &s;ubmit to, and tru&s;t in a Mediator. In this re&s;pect there is as much encouragement to the mo&s;t guilty and vile, as to any what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And as to obtaining a new heart by regenerating grace, they who are the chief of &s;inners, have as much encouragement to hope for this, in the u&s;e of means, as they who&s;e &s;ins are le&s;s aggravated, and not &s;o many or great. It does not appear from &s;cripture, that God choo&s;es out the lea&s;t &s;inners to be the objects of this mercy; or that he withholds it from any meerly becau&s;e they are &s;o guilty and hateful in his &s;ight: or that he waits till men who have been great &s;inners are &s;o reformed as to be|come, all things con&s;idered, le&s;s vile and guilty. And there is not any thing in the bible that &s;hould lead us to think, that God be&s;tows his regenerat|ing grace on the lea&s;t &s;inners more commonly than on tho&s;e who are greater: But we find much there to teach us, that if he ever does this, it is not be|<HI>cau&s;e</HI> they are le&s;s &s;inners than others; but for &s;ome other rea&s;on.</P>
<P>If &s;inners were to take their only encourage|ment to hope for &s;alvation in the u&s;e of means, from their being le&s;s &s;inners than others, or not &s;o bad as they once were, this would tend to take all encouragement from tho&s;e who are under genuine convictions, and have any true view of their own &s;infulne&s;s, and leave them in ab&s;olute de&s;pair. For all &s;uch, as they have a more clear and full &s;ight
<PB N="145" REF="010007_0157_0F7B994C31B41348">
of their own &s;ins than they can have of others, ara naturally led to view them&s;elves as the greate&s;t &s;in|ners. And as by attendance on means, they get more and more acquainted with their own hearts, their own &s;infulne&s;s increa&s;es in their view, they are &s;o far from looking on them&s;elves as le&s;s &s;in|ners than they were, that they naturally view them&s;elves in a contrary light</P>
<P>The only proper way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;inner, who is under any great degree of genuine conviction of &s;in, and concern about his eternal in|tere&s;t, to attend on means with hope, is not to preach up promi&s;es to his doings, and lead him to expect hereby to become le&s;s &s;inful; but to teach him the true end and de&s;ign of means. He will then know that the great wickedne&s;s of his heart, exerci&s;ed in all he does, and his appearing to him|&s;elf to grow wor&s;e rather than better, which is commonly the chief ground of di&s;couragement to &s;uch, is really no rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means; but rather an encouragement con&s;tantly to attend. For this &s;ight and conviction of his own &s;infulne&s;s, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;al|vation, is kept up in his mind and encrea&s;ed, on|ly by attending on means. In this view his own experience &s;erves to &s;hew the advantage of u&s;ing means, and is matter of encouragement and hope.</P>
