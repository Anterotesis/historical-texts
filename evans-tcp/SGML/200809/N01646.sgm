<P>_I Have in this little Book di&s;|tinctly stated and repre&s;ented that &s;olemn Covenant with Al|mighty God, which we all of us enter into at our Bapti&s;m. Be|cau&s;e &s;ince the receiving of the <HI>LORD's SUPPER</HI> is de&s;ign'd for a Reward and Confirmation of that Covenant, the distinct Knowlege of that is nece&s;&s;ary to our Fitne&s;s for this Sacrament; and I have fur|ther di&s;pers'd through the whole, many weighty Arguments to induce Men to keep clo&s;e to that Covenant; it being to us the only way to Salvati|on; that &s;o I might at once promote in many a Religious and good Life, a fitne&s;s for this Sacra|ment, and the attainment of their everlasting Salvation.</P>
<P><PB REF="001954_0005_0FBA42B0614E3EC0">And having made this the Subject and Scope of this Book, I think it way not be ami&s;s to &s;ug|gest, that it is very fit to be recommended and pre&s;ented by tho&s;e who have taken upon them the charitable Office of being God-fathers, or God mothers to &s;uch as they have pre&s;ented to God at the Font. It is the certain Duty of the&s;e &s;piritual Parents, and the Charge laid upon them by the Church, to concern them&s;elves afterwards, and take all the Care they can, that the Child may be taught, as &s;oon as it is able to learn, what a &s;o|lemn Vow, Promi&s;e and Profe&s;&s;ion, it has made by them. This Duty and Charge they would hereby in &s;ome mea&s;ure perform; e&s;pecially if they would al&s;o concern them&s;elves after a time to know what u&s;e their &s;piritual Children have made of it. Cer|tainly, if the Duties and Charge of this most u&s;e|ful &s;piritual Relation were con&s;cientiou&s;ly mind|ed, and in this and the like ways perform'd; we &s;hould not &s;ee &s;o much deplorable Wiekedne&s;s among Profe&s;&s;ors of Christianity as there is, and we might rea&s;onably hope to &s;ee the next Gene|ration at furthest, deliver'd from the Vices and Madne&s;s of this.</P>
<P>And &s;ince this Covenant is implied in Bapti&s;m, when it is not expre&s;s'd in our way; this Book will be u&s;eful to read in all Families, in order to train up young People in the knowledge of their Ingagements to God, and in the way of their Salvation, and to a fitne&s;s for this ble&s;&s;ed Sacra|ment, that they may be confirm'd in that way. To adapt it the better to &s;uch an u&s;e, I have added in the end a Prayer, which is proper to be u&s;ed after the reading of any part of the Book in the Family or Clo&s;et.</P>

<P>_THOU ha&s;t here repre&s;ented to thee in a little room, I think, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to render thee a meet and profitable Receiver of the holy and comfortable Sacrament of the Body and Blood of JESUS CHRIST our Lord.

the Qualifications requi&s;ite to him that comes to this Sacrament, if thou wilt afford this little Book a &s;erious and frequent peru&s;al. If thou ha&s;t been &s;o unhappy, and &s;o much mi&s;taken in thy true intere&s;t as never to have laid the&s;e things to heart before, and to have liv'd in the neglect of this ble&s;&s;ed Ordinance; I would ad|vi&s;e, I would entreat thee often to read and &s;tudy the&s;e things, till thou art familiarly ac|quainted, and deeply affected with them; that thou maye&s;t to thy advantage come well prepared to this Sacrament. If the things here|in contained have already affected thy Heart, and had a good Influence on thy Life, and thou art a frequent Attendant on this Sacrament, it may &s;uffice to read this Book as often as thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t on the Week before thou come&s;t to it, as a good Week's Preparation for it. And for tho&s;e who communicate every Lord's Day (as I wi&s;h all Chri&s;tians did) it may &s;uffice, commonly, to retire &s;ome time on the day be|fore, or get up the &s;ooner on the Sacrament-day, and &s;eriou&s;ly meditate on the Exerci&s;es herein propos'd, which are de&s;ignd' to excite him that has an habitual fitne&s;s for this Sacrament into an actual one, &amp; are u&s;eful for that purpo&s;e.

<P>Becau&s;e what is requi&s;ite to render a Man a meer Receiver of this Sacrament is al&s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry, and is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a good Chri&s;tian, and to bring him to Heaven: There|fore

And whether this holy Sacrament may be accounted and u&s;ed as a means of Conver&s;ion to a good Life or not; yet I hope, that by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, this little Book may be &s;uch a Means to many, if Men will but think it worth their while to do &s;o much to their own Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, as to read and con&s;ider &s;o &s;mall a Treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The Creation of <HI>MAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN it is &s;aid in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> that <HI>God &s;aw every thing that he, had made, and behold it was very good:</HI> This means, that the Creator, upon the review of
<PB N="4" REF="001954_0009_0FBA42BB4E1E7C98">
his Works, was plea&s;ed and delighted herein; and that he hated nothing that he had made: For, what we hate, we wi&s;h that it were not, e&s;pecially not &s;uch as it is. If therefore the Creator had hated any thing that he had made, he had made it to be &s;uch as he would not have it to be; which is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed of Infi|nite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and of &s;uch Power as is able to make every thing what he plea&s;es it &s;hall be. Mankind therefore, among the other Works of God, were made very good, and were plea&s;ing to our Maker. Indeed he made Man a very Noble and Excellent &s;ort of Creature, &s;uch as mu&s;t be peculiarly plea&s;ing to Him&s;elf, above all things in this lower World: As we may judge, by tho&s;e words in Gen. 1.27. <HI>God created Man in his own Image.</HI> This was the peculiar Glory of Man, and that which chiefly advanced him above the Crea|tures about him. And it did principally con|&s;i&s;t in the&s;e things following: That as he had Faculties capable of knowing, loving, and obeying God, he was di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o; He knew God to be the mo&s;t Excellent Being, and did accordingly reverence and e&s;teem him: He knew him to be the Fountain of Good, and his chief Good, and did accordingly fix the choice of his Will upon him; and valued his Favour and Love, by which he enjoy'd God as his greate&s;t and only felicity. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was then no Error or fal&s;e rea&s;oning in his Under|&s;tanding, no perver&s;e Choice in his Will, no Innordinacy in any of his Appetites, no Mo|tions in them contrary to his Rea&s;on. In No|thing
<PB N="5" REF="001954_0010_0FBA42BCD76ACFE0">
was Man inclin'd to contradict his Du|ty to God, or any of the Eternal Laws of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Upon this Account it was that Man was very good, and belov'd of his Maker. And being &s;o belov'd. he liv'd in perfect Peace and Happine&s;s: He was not encumbred with any Evil; he wanted nothing that he had oc|ca&s;ion for. It appears his kind Creator would not cea&s;e doing for him, till he had provided for all his Nece&s;&s;ities and De&s;ires; that &s;o he might be compleatly happy. Man then enjoy'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the willing and ready Service of all Creatures about him. He enjoy'd him&s;elf, and could with plea&s;ure con&s;ider and prai&s;e God for the Noble and Excellent Nature which God had given him: He had an ea&s;y and quiet Mind, had no conflicts with him&s;elf, had no occa&s;ion to rebuke or fall out with him&s;elf. He &eacute;njoy'd then his God too, being a&s;&s;ur'd of his Favour, and receiving the con&s;tant communications of it. He could with great delight, contemplate and prai&s;e the glorious Attributes of God; and the Divine Wi&s;dom, Power, Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Goodne&s;s and Truth, were very plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant to him, while he was a&s;&s;ur'd that all the&s;e were friendly, and would be favourable to him. This was Man's fir&s;t Condition; a very excel|lent and happy one: But alas! through his own default it did not la&s;t long.</P>

<P>IT is very probable, that all the particular Dealings of God with Man in this Condi|tion,
<PB N="6" REF="001954_0011_0FBA42BE50D7EB90">
are not told us in that &s;hort account which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gives us of the beginnings of the World. It being enough for us to know in general, what is the Spring and Source of all that Sin and Mi&s;ery which is now found among Man|kind; the knowledge of which is of &s;ome U&s;e and importance towards our getting free from both. But what is told us of the Tran&s;acti|ons between God and Man in that State, we may think we &s;hall mo&s;t truly under&s;tand, and mo&s;t rightly interpret, if we guide our &s;elves herein by the Tenour of his dealing with Mankind &s;ince that. From what is told us then of that Time, and from what appears &s;ince, we may learn, That it plea&s;ed the Crea|tor when he had made Man, and had &s;o high|ly oblig'd him, to take upon him the Rela|tion of a Governour to his Creature, as he had the undoubted right of one; and he very ju&s;t|ly thought fit to exerci&s;e a Dominion over him for his good. It was therefore, we may &s;uppo&s;e, promi&s;ed to Man, that he &s;hould en|joy the Favour of his Maker, and a perfect Happine&s;s both of Body and Soul, upon Con|dition that he would continue in the due re|verence and love of his Maker, and obey his Commands. And it was made known to him, that he &s;hould fall from the be&s;t of his Ex|cellency, from that wherein he was &s;o plea&s;ing to his Maker; and from all his Happine&s;s, if he did not continue &s;tedfa&s;t in his Duty, and perfectly perform it, as God had enabled him to do. And this is that which is commonly called, <HI>The First</HI> COVENANT.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> The <HI>SACRAMENTS</HI> of That.</HEAD>
<P>MOREOVER, God having made Man to con&s;i&s;t of a Body and Soul, and knowing that it is natural to him, for the Objects of his Sen&s;es to make great Impre&s;&s;ions, and to have a mighty Influence upon his Mind: His Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s order'd Matters &s;o, as that his Sen&s;es might help to admoni&s;h him of his Duty, and to a&s;&s;ure him of his Happine&s;s in the performance of it. And this we may &s;up|po&s;e was the rea&s;on and Ground of God's &s;epa|rating two Trees in the Garden where he had placed our fir&s;t Parents, for a peculiar and un|common U&s;e: The one call'd, <HI>The Tree of Knowlege of Good and Evil</HI>; the other call'd, <HI>The Tree of Life.</HI> The&s;e we may reckon to have been the Sacraments of the fir&s;t Covenant: For in the&s;e were Spiritual things by God's appointment repre&s;ented by outward and vi&s;i|ble Signs and Actions: Man was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to re|member his Duty and Obligations to his Maker by that Tree, call'd, <HI>The Tree of Knowledge of good and Evil</HI>: For we may &s;uppo&s;e that the Fruit of this Tree was &s;et apart by God whol|ly for the following purpo&s;e: Man was to take care to cultivate this Tree as well as others; but he was to offer the Fruit of it at &s;et times &s;olemnly and religiou&s;ly to God, as a vi&s;ible ac|knowledgment that he own'd him the Maker of all things, and the &s;upreme Lord, and the Proprietor of all. This was re&s;erved, as we
<PB N="8" REF="001954_0013_0FBA42C199DF36F8">
may &s;ay, by God, to be a devoted thing, and Man's Thank-offering to him for all the re&s;t of his Gifts. And for this rea&s;on Man was forbid to eat of it him&s;elf. For we find in later Times, it was always held a very heinous and guilty thing for Men to ear of, or u&s;e what God had &s;eparated and re&s;erved to him&s;elf. Now for &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible outward performance, as the &s;olemn offering of this Fruit to God, and the looking upon it, and u&s;ing it only as a Devoted thing, was an excellent and fit means to admo|ni&s;h Mankind for ever to acknowlege their Cre|ator and Pre&s;erver as the &s;upream Lord and Proprietor of all things; as it was a &s;en&s;ible Declaration that they did make this acknow|ledgment, &s;o it was a &s;en&s;ible Obligation of them&s;elves that they would continue to do &s;o; and the more a help to them to continue it, &amp; to an&s;wer all the Obligations which naturally re&s;ult from it in the Cour&s;e of their Lives.</P>
<P>And then the other Tree was appointed to a&s;&s;ure Man, upon his perfect Obedience, of his Immortality and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. So that whil&s;t he continued &s;tedfa&s;t in his Duty, he had right to take and eat the fruit of this Tree: And he might take it as God's vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible pledge, and as an In&s;trument of Conveyance of Eternal Life and Happine&s;s to him, in like manner, as now we have leave from God to look upon the Rain-bow, not only as the natural effect of the Sun &s;hining up|on a falling Shower, but, as God's vi&s;ible pledge and a&s;&s;urance to Mankind, that he will never again de&s;troy the World with a Deluge of Wa|ter.</P>

<P>THIS Account &s;hews the exceeding great Guilt and Wickedne&s;s of the Sin of our fir&s;t parents. Their Sin was, that they did cat of the forbidden Fruit; and &s;o they u&s;ed and took to them&s;elves what was re&s;erved and de|voted to God: It was the bringing to a common u&s;e, that which was &s;eparated by his appoint|ment to a religious one, and was the profaning of a hallow'd or holy thing. But let it be con|&s;ider'd a little how mon&s;trous and vile this Sin of our fir&s;t Parents was! How &s;oon had they forgotten the mighty obligations which the Creator had &s;o lately laid upon them! How bountiful had he been unto them! And he witheld and re&s;erv'd but one Fruit to him&s;eif; &amp; this, we may &s;ay, they grudg'd &amp; envy'd him: They would not be content with &s;o va&s;t a pro|vi&s;ion as he had made for them, but would needs have this afforded too. The poor de|pending Creature, that deriv'd his Being, and all he had, would needs be &s;ole proprietor and ab|&s;olute Lord of all things on the Earth, &amp; would acknowledge no Superiour! They had no need of this Fruit, were perfectly happy without it; &amp; might have contined &s;o happy, if they would have ab&s;tained from this; but they mo&s;t un|rea&s;onably de&s;pi&s;ed their Happine&s;s, and ha|zarded the lo&s;ing it for the &s;ake of the Satis|faction and Advantage which they expected from this &s;ingle Fruit. The Creator indeed
<PB N="10" REF="001954_0015_0FBA42C617E733A0">
had been &s;o good to them, they would not be lieve he would &s;o &s;everely puni&s;h their eating this Fruit as he had threatned to do; and &s;o that which &s;hould have oblig'd them to be &s;tedfa&s;t in their Duty, was mo&s;t perver&s;ly turn'd into an encouragement to Sin. O vile and &s;hameful Wickedne&s;s! Let us con&s;ider from what a vile original we all &s;pring, and be hum|bled and a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>In yielding to this foul act, they lo&s;t that Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s which they had been endow'd with, and by which e&s;pecially they had been plea&s;ing to their Maker.</P>
<P>In this al&s;o they broke the Condition of the fir&s;t Covenant, which required that they &s;hould con&s;tantly reverence and love their Creator, and obey him in all things. And the &s;ad Con&s;e|quence of this was, That they hereby lo&s;t the Favour of God, and forfeited all their own Happine&s;s. They lo&s;t all right to the good things of this World; to the Obedience and Servicea|blene&s;s of the Creatures which God had made for them. They became liable to the penalty which God had threatned to inflict, and im|mediately upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion did de&s;erve to have been put to Death, and to be thrown into the place of everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, pre|par'd for the Devil and his Angels.</P>

as it was &s;aid, <HI>In the Day thou eatest thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die</HI>: If the Son God had not become a Mediator on their behalf. And he freely undertook to do whatever might be nece&s;&s;ary to tender it con&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of God to receive his rebellious Creatures into Favour again, to relea&s;e their obligation to everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, and re&s;tore them to perfect Happine&s;s. What he then undertook to do to this purpo&s;e, we may learn and conclude from what he did in the fulne&s;s of time: And that was, That he would unite him&s;elf to the Humane Nature, and would be|come Man. In that nature he would perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m a perfect obedience to God the Father, that he might merit for Mankind the Happine&s;s which was &s;etled to be the reward of perfect Obedience. And to excu&s;e Man from the eternal Death which he had de&s;erved by his Sin, he undertook to &s;uffer Death in his &s;tead, and &s;o to make his Death a Sacrifice for the Sin of Mankind. Thus much did he, very kindly and of his own accord, undertake to do for us; and he was accepted of the Father, and a&s;&s;ur'd that he &s;hould, by doing thus, ob|tain the Favour for us which he de&s;ir'd. So he procur'd for Man that he &s;hould not be ut|terly ca&s;t off and thrown into endle&s;s Mi&s;ery; but have other Terms of Favour appointed him: And this di&s;pen&s;ation or Appointment, is that which is called the NEW COVENANT: And it is called the New Covenant in his Blood, becau&s;e it was procur'd by his undertaking to &s;hed his Blood in the Humane Nature as a

Sacrifice for Sin. Upon this our fir&s;t Parents were permitted to live, to enjoy, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, the good things of this world for a while, and had &s;pace allow'd them to make their Peace with God, to recover his Favour, and their own Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t know, that &s;ince it was a &s;etled Law before the Fall of Man, that he &s;hould propagate &s;uch as him&s;elf; and his po&s;terity &s;hould be reckon'd in the &s;ame &s;tate and relati|on towards God with their Father, who began them: Therefore when the fir&s;t Parents o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mankind thus became polluted by their Sin, and were fallen into the &s;tate of guilty Rebels again&s;t God; all their po&s;terity mu&s;t needs come polluted into this world, as unclean things out of unclean, mu&s;t be <HI>born Children of Wrath,</HI> as the Scripture &s;peaks.

<P>FIRST let us take notice of our own part of this Covenant, and ob&s;erve what it is that
<PB N="13" REF="001954_0018_0FBA42CFBAB60398">
God requires of us, to whom the Go&s;pel is preached, which we mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. And becau&s;e all mankind are now con&s;ider'd by God as guilty and polluted Creatures; as having &s;in|ned, and being di&s;po&s;ed to do wickedly; there is fir&s;t required of us, That we repent and turn from Sin. In the next place, becau&s;e we mu&s;t return to God; it is required, That we do be|lieve all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith: And la&s;tly, That we engage our &s;elves, and en|deavour to keep God's Holy Will and Com|mandments, &amp; walk in the &s;ame all the days of our life. But becau&s;e the Heart of Man is deceit|ful and wicked, and we are &s;o backward to do our Duty, that we are unwilling to know it; therefore it will be requi&s;ite to mention &s;ome|what particularly, the Things contain'd under the&s;e three general heads.</P>
<P><HI>The first</HI> main Branch of our Duty is, that we repent and turn from &s;in: To which purpo&s;e we mu&s;t &s;tand at a defiance with all the cau&s;es of &s;in, and re&s;olve they &s;hall not govern us. Therefore has the Church been wont to expre&s;s this Branch of our Duty thus: We mu&s;t renounce the Devil, and all his works; the Pomp and Vanities of this wicked World, with all the covetous De&s;ires of the &s;ame: And all the &s;inful De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h, &s;o as that we will not fol|low, nor be led by them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t renounce the Devil and all his Works. It was by the Craft and In&s;tigation of this Apo&s;tate Spirit, the Enemy of our Happine&s;s, that Mankind were at fir&s;t drawn into Di&s;obedi|ence
<PB N="14" REF="001954_0019_0FBA42D12FD0BCE8">
again&s;t God. We mu&s;t re&s;olve therefore never to have any Corre&s;pondence with him; to abhor and ab&s;tain from all tho&s;e guilty ways of con&s;ulting him, or &s;eeking his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the ungodly World have ever practi&s;ed. We mu&s;t never knowingly, or willingly, obey any of his Commands, nor comply with his Temptations. We mu&s;t re&s;olve to fight again&s;t all tho&s;e Spiritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in our &s;elves, which he infects the humane nature with, &s;uch as Pride, Anger, Envy, Treachery, Lying, Malice, and Cruelty. Mu&s;t abhor to imitate or follow him in the tempting of others to wickedne&s;s; or in the Hatred and Per&s;ecution of good men for the &s;ake of their Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o renounce the Pomp and Vanities of this wicked World, and all covetous De&s;ires of the &s;ame. That is, we mu&s;t re&s;olve and en|gage that we will not let the love of the World rule in our Hearts, which is oppo&s;ite to the Love of God. We will not let our Hearts fix on the Wealth, the Plea&s;ures, or the Dignities, and Honours here below: Nor will make the getting of them the Aim and Scope of our chief En|deavour and care; nor let the Enjoyment of them be our cheife&s;t Delight and Satisfaction. That we will not be guided by the Cu&s;toms of the World, nor follow a multitude to do evil: That our deare&s;t Relations, or our mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t u&s;eful friends and Benefactors, &s;hall not be able to influence us again&s;t the Will of God, and the Dictates of our Con&s;cience: That we will be ready to part with all that is dear, all is nece&s;&s;ary to us, and which we might
<PB N="15" REF="001954_0020_0FBA42D298A07180">
otherwi&s;e lawfully keep and enjoy, when they &s;tand in Competition with our Love and Duty to God. And we will &s;ubmit to any Inconveni|ences in the want even of nece&s;&s;ary things, ra|ther than to do any thing to gain them, which is contrary to the Laws of Divine Love.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t further renounce, mortifie, and aban|don all &s;inful De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h: All the irre|gular &amp; di&s;obedint Inclinations of our corrupt Nature mu&s;t be mortified and &s;ubdued. We mu&s;t chace away tho&s;e fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts which war a|gain&s;t the Soul; the Love of &s;lothful Ea&s;e, and Idlene&s;s, all Intemperance, and La&s;civiou&s;|ne&s;s. We mu&s;t for&s;ake and ab&s;tain from all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual Sins, which abu&s;e and prodigally wa&s;te God's good Creatures; which en&s;lave the Thoughts and Faculties of the Soul to the Ap|petites of the Body; and which render the Soul unfit for the due Exerci&s;es and Operations of its Faculties; and which tend to clog and encum|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er the Body with Di&s;ea&s;es. We mu&s;t renounce all the&s;e three Sources of Evil, the Devil, the World, and the Fle&s;h, and mu&s;t re&s;olve we will not follow nor be led by them. And this is the Fir&s;t main Branch of our Duty under the New Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>The Second</HI> is this: We mu&s;t believe all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith. And this re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uires of us to promi&s;e and perform the Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollowing: That we will &s;eriou&s;ly apply our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elves, as our lei&s;ure and opportunity will al|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow us, to make the be&s;t improvement that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an of the means of Divine Knowledge which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rovidence of God affords us; that &s;o we may

gain as much of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;timable Trea&s;ure as we can: That we will not through Negligence or Hatred of the Truth be ignorant of any im|portant revealed Truth. That whatever does ap|pear to us to be revealed from God concerning him&s;elf and our way to Happine&s;s, we will re|ceive it as a certain truth, becau&s;e it comes from him who is infinite in Wi&s;dom, &amp; cannot be de|ceived; and is a God of Truth, and therefore cannot deceive.</P>
<P>The&s;e Articles of our Faith are &s;ummarily comprehended in that <HI>Form of &s;ound Doctrine,</HI> which is commonly called the Apo&s;tles Creed, among which the&s;e are chief ones. That we be|lieve in God the Father, who hath made us and all the World. That we believe in God the Son, who hath redeemed us and all Mankind; which implies the&s;e things: We mu&s;t believe that all Mankind are guilty before God, and ob|noxious to his Eternal Wrath and Puni&s;hment. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God, died as a Sa|crfice for the Sins of Men: That he &s;ubmitted to an accur&s;ed Death, as the Puni&s;hment of Sin in our &s;tead, and to excu&s;e us from &s;uffering it for ever: That his Death is accepted with the Father as an Atonement for Sin, and &s;hall re|dound to the advantage of all tho&s;e who re|pent and believe on him: Who being heartily &s;orry for their Sins, and fallen out with them, do for&s;ake them and turn to God; and do expect and rely upon the Merit of his Death, to find fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our with God. We mu&s;t believe, that as Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for our Sins, &s;o he ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification&punc; Having made a full Attonement,
<PB N="17" REF="001954_0022_0FBA42D59C16B838">
he was relea&s;ed from the Bonds of Death: and is a&s;cended into Heaven; and that he ever lives there to make Interce&s;&s;ion for us; that is, to ob|tain and be&s;tow upon wretched Mankind, all the ble&s;&s;ed Benefits which his Death has pur|cha&s;ed for them. And we mu&s;t believe in God the Holy Gho&s;t, who graciou&s;ly applies all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings to us, and who &s;anctifies us and all the Elect People of God.</P>
<P>Further: We al&s;o are bound and required to make our open Profe&s;&s;ion of the Religion con|tain'd in the&s;e Articles; and to own it to the World, that we are, and will be the Wor&s;hipers of the one only true and living God, by one Me|diator between God and man, the Man Chri&s;t Je|&s;us. And we mu&s;t chu&s;e rather to &s;uffer any lo&s;s, or to die, than to renounce or deny our Faith. And we are bound al&s;o to lead a Life &s;uitable to the&s;e Articles of Faith, to let them govern our Conver&s;ations as they ought to do: And our Faith mu&s;t work or operate in the Exerci&s;es of Love. This is the Second main Branch of our Duty under the New Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>The Third</HI> is this: That we mu&s;t engage and endeavour to keep God's Holy Will and Com|mandments, and to walk in the &s;ame all the Days of our Life. And this obliges us to the Things following, That we will diligently &s;tu|dy and learn the Will of God, as it is expre&s;s'd in the Laws which he has given us; will not cavil nor di&s;pute again&s;t our Duty, when we &s;hould perform it; will endevour to know our Duty, that we may do it. That we will love his Law, and it &s;hall be our con&s;tant Aim and En|deavour
<PB N="18" REF="001954_0023_0FBA42D71DC16E80">
to conform to it in all things: We ab&s;o|lutely bind our &s;elves, and are bound to live in no willful, known, and pre&s;umptous Sin. That we will not deliberately and knowingly tre&s;pa&s;s a|gain&s;t the Law of God. This Covenant indeed does not require of us to <HI>preform</HI> a perfect Obedi|ence; for that is a thing now above our power: but it binds us to <HI>endeavour</HI> a perfect Obedience; that is, not to be willingly guilty of any known Sin. There is, alas, no meer Man now, that can con&s;tantly &amp; perfectly keep the whole Law of God but <HI>in many things we offend all:</HI> And 'tis one Ble&s;&s;ing of the New Covenant, that it par|dons Sins (as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently) which &s;uppo&s;es Defects in our be&s;t Obedience. There|fore al&s;o our Saviour has taught us to pray as daily for the pardon of Sin, as for our daily Bread. But this Covenant bears with none but involuntary Sins; &s;uch as we commit through Ignorance or Surpri&s;e, and for want of Con&s;i|deration, on a &s;udden, when our Ignorance and Incon&s;ideration are not wilful, nor due to the neglect of our &s;elves. And as for known, wil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and Pre&s;umptuous Sins, and &s;uch as are de|liberately committed; they put us out of this Covenant, and lo&s;e us all right to the Favours and Ble&s;&s;ings of it, till they are bitterly repented of, and utterly for&s;aken.</P>
<P>Thus much we mu&s;t heartily &amp; &s;incerely bind &amp; engage our &s;elves to do; and this is our part of the New Covenant. This is al&s;o called the Covenant of Grace or Favour; and we may &s;ee that it has ju&s;tly that Name, in that it admits of Repentance for Sin, and accepts of that poor
<PB N="19" REF="001954_0024_0FBA42D925493E08">
imperfect Obedience, which is all that we can now perform: And we &s;hall &s;ee that Name fur|ther ju&s;tified, in that it will appear to be one of the Ble&s;&s;ings and Favours of it, that it affords us &s;trength to perform our Duty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> On <HI>GOD's</HI> Part.</HEAD>
<P>AND now I come to repre&s;ent and &s;hew what are the Favours and Ble&s;&s;ings on God's Part, of this New Covenant. What he offers, and promi&s;es, and will be&s;tow, upon our Performance of the Duties and Conditions re|quired of us. And the&s;e may be comprehended under the&s;e three rich and important Heads.</P>
<P><HI>The First</HI> is a full and free Pardon of all our Sins. God will blot our Iniquities, as it were, out of his Remembrance; will forget that we were Sinners, and will treat us as righteous, Will lay a&s;ide his mo&s;t ju&s;t Wrath again&s;t us: and embrace us with the Arms of Mercy and Love. He that might mo&s;t Righteou&s;ly have de|&s;troy'd us with an Everla&s;ting De&s;truction, will rejoyce over us to do us good. He will pardon our mo&s;t numerous Sins; will pardon the great|e&s;t Offences; will pardon even our known, wilful and deliberate Sins, and our Cu&s;toms of Sinning, upon our Repentance and for&s;aking of them. And a general Repentance and a humble Behavour towards God, will obtain the Pardon of tho&s;e infirmities and involuntary Sins which we do not ob&s;erve our &s;elves to be guilty of, and cannot be perfectly free from. And having thus pardoned all our Sins, the Cour&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="001954_0025_0FBA42DAD099FC18">
of Mercy is free; all Ob&s;truction of it is remov'd and we may addre&s;s to God with Boldne&s;s in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as to a reconciled Father; and believe him ready to afford us all that is nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>The next</HI> Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing of this Covenant is, The re&s;toring of the Divine Image in us in our Sanctification. If upon the Propo&s;al of this Covenant to us we do accept of it, and are wil|ling to yeild to the Conditions it requires, and to give up our &s;elves to a Life of Holine&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s according to the Laws of God, He will give us Spiritual &s;trength to perform our Duty &s;o far, as that we &s;hall be accepted through the Mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If we will not undertake, we &s;hall not be able to per|form; but if we will undertake and bind our &s;elves to do our Duty, he will enable us to per|form it. It might &s;eem a &s;trange thing that God &s;hould require of us to bind our &s;elves and undertake to do that which we cannot do of our &s;elves, (as we do in obliging our &s;elves to all tho&s;e things fore-mentioned) if it were not that the very binding our &s;elves to this does entitle us by the Tenour of this Covenant to Grace &s;ufficient for us. In all the Exhortations of the Go&s;pel to an In&s;tance of Duty, we may reckon there is comprehended al&s;o the Offer of Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;hall be afforded to him who yeilds, in the purpo&s;e and de&s;ire of his Soul, to comply with tho&s;e Exhortations. No Man therefore &s;hall have ground to com|plain, that he would leave his known Sins, and do the Duties which he knows he omits,
<PB N="21" REF="001954_0026_0FBA42E05C1871A0">
but cannot do &s;o: For if a man &s;incerely de|&s;ires to leave his Sins, devotes him&s;elf to his Duty, and Diligently u&s;es the Means that may enable him to do it: That is, If he waits on God for this Grace in earne&s;t and per&s;eve|ring Prayer, and a due attendance on the Preach|ing of the Word and the Sacraments, that Man &s;hall infallibly come to be able to do what he thus wills and de&s;ires. For, <HI>He that hungers and thirsts after Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall be filled,</HI> as our Saviour &s;ays; And <HI>God will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> It is the Favour of this New Covenant to help us to do what it requires us to do.</P>
<P><HI>The last</HI> Favour and ble&s;&s;ing of this Covenant, is an Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s both of Body and Soul in Heaven. We are left by it indeed &s;ub|ject to a natural Death; to mind us of our guil|ty Rebellion again&s;t God: That we may not forget we are Sinners, and do de&s;erve an Eternal Death: On purpo&s;e that the &s;ence of this might quicken our de&s;ire and concern to recover the Divine Favour, and make us the more ready and willing to &s;ubmit to the terms of recover|ing it. But Death &s;hall not long have Domi|nion over us: God will not leave the Soul in Hell; that is, it &s;hall not be always &s;eperated from the Body; nor &s;hall the Body be always &s;ubject to the Ignominy and Puni&s;hment of its Di&s;&s;olution. Since the Sins are pardon'd which did de&s;erve Death, the Creature &s;hall be relea&s;ed from it: And our Savour's Re&s;urection from the Dead does e&s;pecially a&s;&s;ure the Re&s;urection of tho&s;e that believe on him, He has al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="001954_0027_0FBA42E30DE37350">
that he will <HI>give them Eternal Life, &amp; rai&s;e them up again at the last day.</HI> The Body, then, however &s;catter'd and di&s;pers'd, and lo&s;t to all knowledge of Men, &s;hall be gather'd together by the Wi&s;dom of God, and be rai&s;ed to Life by his Almighty Power: And it &s;hall be rai&s;ed with great advantage; <HI>It was &s;own a Natural Body, it &s;hall be rai&s;ed a Spiritual Body; It was &s;own in Corruption,</HI> but <HI>it &s;hall be rai&s;ed Immo|tal.</HI> And the Soul &s;hall be again united to it, never to be &s;eperated more: But both &s;hall be taken up to dwell in a glorious happy place, where is <HI>fulne&s;s of joy, and plea&s;ure; for ever|more:</HI> To live in the Fellow&s;hip and Communion of kind, happy, and glorious Angels: To dwell in the Pre&s;ence of God, and contemplate, and prai&s;e, and love him, and rejoyce in his love for ever. This is now the whole Tenour of the New Covenant, which was procur'd for us by the precious Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our kind and powerful Advocate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> The <HI>SACRAMENTS</HI> of this Covenant.</HEAD>
<P>AND this Covenant al&s;o hath its Sacaments. God has appointed &s;en&s;ible Actions and Signs, in and by which it is to be made between Him and Us. In the U&s;e of the&s;e Sacraments, we mu&s;t te&s;tifie our Con&s;ent to this Covenant, and &s;ignifie, that we own our &s;elves engag'd in it. And in the u&s;e of the&s;e mu&s;t we wait for, and expect the Ble&s;&s;ings and Favours on God's part to be afforded us. It is by the&s;e that he
<PB N="23" REF="001954_0028_0FBA42E48DE35028">
has determin'd to convey tho&s;e <HI>Favours</HI> which we can at pre&s;ent receive, which are the Pardon of our Sins, and the Sanctification of our Natures; and al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure that which we are to hope for, our Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s and Glory. The&s;e we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily u&s;e, then, if Means &amp; Opportunity be afforded us to do &s;o, that we may be Partakers of his Favours: And in u&s;ing them, we mu&s;t &s;incerely purpo&s;e and bind our &s;elves to the Performance of our Duty. The Sa|craments appointed to be, as we may &s;ay, The In&s;trument of this Covenant &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, which are all that nearly concern us, are Bapti&s;m, and the Supper of the Lord. The&s;e, and the&s;e only, are now generally nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>By Bapti&s;m we are admitted into this Cove|nant, and make our fir&s;t &s;olemn Acceptance of it. By the Lords Supper we renew it, if it has been broken on our part by any wilful Sin&punc; committed &s;ince we were bapti&s;ed: Or el&s;e we therein te&s;tifie and declare our continuance &s;till in it, and our purpo&s;e and de&s;ire to do &s;o; if any of us have liv'd &s;o happily &s;ince we were baptized, as never to violate or break this Cove|nant by any wilful known Sin.</P>
<P>It is true, when we are baptized in our Infan|cy, we are not capable expre&s;ly to intend &amp; de|&s;ign the performances of our part in this Cove|nant, becau&s;e we cannot then under&s;tand or know it. But this Sacaament is in the pur|po&s;e of God de&s;ign'd for the Scrament of our Ad|mi&s;&s;ion into this Covenant, &s;ince the appearance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the World. And as that which
<PB N="24" REF="001954_0029_0FBA42E62402B448">
was the Sacrament of this Admi&s;&s;ion under the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation, was by God's Appointment admin&s;tred to Children at eight days old; &s;o the Chri&s;tian Church has been wont, even from the Apo&s;tles times, to admini&s;ter Bapti&s;m to In|fants, from whence it is not to be doubted but they learn to do this from the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves: And our Saivour gives a plain Encou|ragement to the Practice, when he &s;ays, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Our Church therefore, as without doubt it ought to do, admini&s;ters Bapti&s;m to Infants that they may partake of the Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Co|venant to their Salvation.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there is an Ingagement on the part of the Baptized Per&s;on <HI>implied</HI> in his re|ceiving Bapti&s;m; the Wi&s;dom and Piety of the Church has thought fit that it &s;hould be <HI>ex|pre&s;s'd</HI> too: That &s;o the bapti&s;ed Per&s;on may be better convinced afterwards, That he did thus engage him&s;elf at his Bapti&s;m. And be|cau&s;e the infant it &s;elf cannot expre&s;s this, the Church has provided, that &s;ome Chri&s;tian Friends &s;hould do it for us, who are al&s;o Wit|ne&s;&s;es that the thing is done. And they are bound to take care, that as we grow up to the U&s;e of our Rea&s;on, we may grow al&s;o in the Knowledge of our part in this Covenant, and may come to under&s;tand what we are bound to.</P>
<P>And that the bapti&s;ed Per&s;on him&s;elf may ratifie and confirm his bapti&s;mal Engagement, he mu&s;t, when he can exerci&s;e his Rea&s;on, and

This our Church has very ju&s;tly ordered &s;hould be &s;olemnly and publickly done in the recieving of Confirmati|on.

<P>But this Di&s;cour&s;e is de&s;ign'd cheifly to bring Men prepar'd to the Lords Supper, that they may worthily and profitably receive that; &amp; therefore it mu&s;t not be diverted &s;o as to in|&s;i&s;t long on any other Subject but what is nece&s;|&s;ary and &s;erviceable to that de&s;ign and end of it.</P>

<P>This Sacrament is ordain'd of God to be a Pledge &amp; Conveyance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, &amp; &s;hall actually &amp; infallibly be &s;o to meet Receivers: God will ne'er be wanting to his Sacraments, nor leave them without the Efficacy he de&s;ings them for, if the Receivers be not wanting to them&s;elves. He faithfully intends the Renewal, and Con|firmation of this Covenant with us in this Sa|crament, and will actually do it if we &s;incerely intend the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>And that the Renewal of our part of the Covenant at this Sacrament is expected and re|quired by God, cannot chu&s;e but be very ea&s;i|ly apprehended. When God offers good things upon Terms and Conditions, he requires the binding our &s;elves to perform tho&s;e Con|ditions, if we will partake of tho&s;e good things; and our embracing the Offers he makes, implies, and ought to imply, the accepting of tho&s;e Terms, and the engaging our &s;elves to perform tho&s;e Conditions. To be &s;ure God never intends we &s;hall be partakers of tho&s;e good things, without performing tho&s;e Condi|tions. When 'tis &s;aid, God <HI>gives the holy Spi|rit to them that a&s;k him,</HI> 'tis imply'd that <HI>a&s;king</HI> is the nece&s;&s;ary Condition and Means of ha|ving; <HI>God gave his only begotten Son, that

they who believe in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have Everla&s;ting Life</HI>; 'Tis required Men <HI>believe</HI> as a Condition of their obtaining Everla&s;ting Life, So when it is &s;aid, <HI>Je&s;us Christ is the Author of Salvation to them that obey him</HI>; and <HI>Repent that your Sins may be blotted out</HI>: The&s;e things evidently imply, that our Sins &s;hall not be forgiven, unle&s;s we <HI>repent</HI> of them; not will the Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us him|&s;elf be a Saviour to us, if we do not <HI>devote our &s;elves to his Service,</HI> and give up our &s;elves to follow his Example and Conduct. Now this being the con&s;tant Tenour of the Go&s;pel; We mu&s;t needs Conclude, that when we are offer'd to be made partakers of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings in this Sacrament, it is required, that if we de|&s;ire them, we mu&s;t bind our &s;elves to perform &s;uch Conditions.</P>
<P>Our receiving therefore of tho&s;e things which are God's Pledges and Coveyances of tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings upon Conditions, is an out|ward Profe&s;&s;ion and Declaration that we bind our &s;elves to do what is required of us! And if that outward profe&s;&s;ion be not attended with an inward and &s;incere Intention, it is hor|rid Hypocri&s;ie, and makes a Man undoubted|ly <HI>guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ:</HI> He is reckoned to have abu&s;ed &amp; profaned the Bo|dy and Blood of Chri&s;t, as did the wretched Men that &s;lew him. The receiving tho&s;e Ele|ments in this Sacrament is an outward profe&s;&s;ion and Declaration that we accept of God's Co|venant, and it certainly bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds us &s;incerely to

intend our performance of the Conditions of it.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle plainly gives this In&s;truction in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. in that he intimates the parta|king of this Sacrament to be a Rite of the &s;ame Nature and Signification with the eating of the Sacrifices which had been offer'd to any god. As the Eating of tho&s;e Sacrifices therefore &s;ignified the owning him for God, to whom the Sacrifice had been made, and &s;o the obliging of them&s;elves to wor&s;hip and obey him; and the Reliance upon that Sacri|fice to find Favour and obtain a Ble&s;&s;ing from him; &s;o the Eating of the Lords Supper mu&s;t be reckon'd to imply and declare the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ions and engagements. This is the Eat|ing of a Sacrifice made to God, even the great Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t; and therefore mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tended with Faith or a Re|liance upon that Sacrifice to find Favour with him; the owning him to be God, and the binding our &s;elves to honour, love and obey him. For this rea&s;on it is that the Apo&s;tle forbids in that Chapter tho&s;e who would par|take of this Sacrament the Eating of any Fea&s;ts upon Sacrifices whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been offer'd to the Heathen Idols; which Sacrifices he &s;ays were offer'd to Devils: <HI>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the cup of Devils&punc; Ye cannot be par|takers of the Lord's Table and of the Table of Devils</HI>; &s;ays he, <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>Ye cannot,</HI> may mean, <HI>'tis impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> you &s;hould &s;incerely intend what is &s;ignified by both the&s;e things; that is, the owning the true God as God, and the owning
<PB N="30" REF="001954_0035_0FBA42F82B657B58">
tho&s;e Devils as God, for in owning one, you do imply the renouncing of the other To be &s;ure the true God requires, if you own him, that you do renounce all other. Or it mu&s;t mean, <HI>You ought not</HI> to do thus. If you partake of the Cup and Table of the Lord, you mu&s;t &s;in|cerely intend thereby the owning of him; and then you mu&s;t not &s;o much as &s;eem to own tho&s;e filthy Devils in eating of the Sacrifices which have been offer'd to them. Therefore he adds in the 22d Ver&s;e, That in doing thus, they did <HI>provoke the Lord to Jealou&s;ie</HI>; becau&s;e they made a &s;hew and appearance of departing from, and of renouncing him herein. The A|po&s;tle then plainly teaches us, that in receiv|ing this Sacrament, we do make profe&s;&s;ion and &s;how of honouring and covenanting with God; and therefore that we ought really and &s;incere|ly to intend it.</P>
<P>I might &s;how that the Name of <HI>Sacrament</HI> was given to this Ordinance by the fir&s;t Chri&s;t|ians, becau&s;e they reckon'd the Celebrating this Supper to &s;ignifie the Binding our &s;elves to &s;erve and honour, love and obey and tru&s;t in God; to be his faithful Subjects and Servants. And &s;o notorious was it, that they u&s;ed it as a Ceremony of covenanting with God; that even the Heathens knew this, and therefore one of them &s;peaking of the Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies in his time for Wor&s;hip (at which they always Celebrated this Sacrament) &s;ays; They met to|gether on a fixed Day before it was light, (this was for fear of their enemies) and did there bind them&s;elves by an Oath or Sacrament not to

commit any Thefts or Adulteries, nor to betray any Tru&s;t, or deal deceitfully with their Neigh|bour, and the like. They then took this Sa|crament as an Engagement to be of the Religion of Je&s;us, and &s;o to perform the Terms and Con|ditions of the New Covenant: We therefore mu&s;t, when we receive it, &s;incerely intend the Confirmation of that Covenant.</P>

<P>Let all Men know then, that when they are come to years, and are capable to know and to renew their Vow and Covenant which they made in Bapti&s;m, they are commanded by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in this way to renew and confirm it. They are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to receive this Sacrament in Confirmation of that Covenant. No Man is left at Liberty whether he will receive this Sacrament or not; but if the Providence of God affords him Means and Opportunity to do &s;o, he is bound to prepare him&s;elf for, and receive it.

the Sacrament it &s;elf. He that does not endeavour to be prepared, &amp; receive it as often as Opportunity is afforded him to do it in that Congregation of Chri&s;tians, which the Order of the Church and Obedience to the Governours of it does oblige him to join with; He does &s;o often neglect and refu&s;e it, as he thus ab|&s;ents him&s;elf from it. But the neglect and re|fu&s;al of this, we mu&s;t know, is the neglect &amp; refu&s;al of the incomparble Ble&s;&s;ings of the New Covenant; of having the pardon of our Sins renewed and Sealed; the Ble&s;&s;ed Influen|ces of the Holy Spirit tenewed upon us; and our Title confirmed to Everla&s;ting Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and our Hopes of it increa&s;ed and &s;trengthened; 'tis to neglect our own Intere&s;t, and to provoke the Di&s;plea&s;ure of God, more than by any o|ther Sins, in neglecting the Offers of his Grace and Mercy.</P>
<P>Let all tho&s;e who never mind this Sacra|ment, nor do ever prepare them&s;elves for it, nor receive it, know, That they do therein in|timate the renouncing of their Covenant with God, and do cut them&s;elves off from all Hopes and Expectations of the Favours and Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant of Grace, till they repent of this guilty Omi&s;&s;ion of their Duty, and &s;o come to this Sacrament prepared for it. Oh wretch|ed Creatures! They chu&s;e to remain in a &s;tate of Damnation.

<P>Whatever pretended Wi&s;hes a Man may have to for&s;ake his Sins, whatever Regret and Re|mor&s;e for them, and whatever Re&s;olutions he makes to for&s;ake them, they will not be acc|epted with God, not bring him into a Title to the Favour of this Covenant, if he has Oppor|tunity and Means to Partake of this Sacrament, and refu&s;es to do it: Becau&s;e 'tis <HI>in</HI> and <HI>by</HI> this Sacrament that God expects &amp; requires the Re|newal of this Covenant after we have broken nit: Our Repentance is not compleated accor|ding to the Will of God till this is done, if he Affords us Means and Opportunity to do this. We are not Allowed to expect that he will Ac|cept our Re&s;olutions and Vows in any other way, when he has Appointed us this way of pre&s;enting them to Him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Is it not a wonderful thing that Men &s;hould forget that this Sacrament is ap|pointed by God as the Means to Convey to them the &s;trength to perform their good Vows and Re&s;olutions? And then he that Neglects this Sacrament, lays him&s;elf under the Power and Tyranny of his Sins, by Neglecting the Mighty Help which Heaven kindly affords him again&s;t it: And he binds upon him&s;elf the Guilt of all his Sins, and as it were Seals Him|&s;elf

<P>Let all Men know, that the Wilful Neglect &amp; Refu&s;al of this Sacrament is a Damnable Sin of Omi&s;&s;ion, and puts every Man that is Guil|ty of it out of a State of Grace &amp; Salvation: And they that Neglect to come to this Ordi|nance when 'tis prepared for them, may very ju&s;tly Fear that God will not Ble&s;s any other to them: For what Ground have they to think He will Ble&s;s one of his Ordinances to them, while they Neglect another, or let them Ob|tain by Prayer &amp; Hearing the Word what he Commanded them to u&s;e this Sacrament for too, that they may Obtain it; And then they that live in Neglect of this, are in great Danger Never to be Saved by any other Means of Sal|vation.</P>
<P>Men may perhaps think them&s;elves very Good Chri&s;tians if they keep their Church, attend the Publick Prayers, and &s;ometimes Hear, &s;ometimes Sleep away a Sermon: But if they Neglect this Sacrament, they mu&s;t Expect God will Reject all there other Performances: <HI>He that breaks the Law, in one Point,</HI> the Scrip-&s;ays, <HI>is guilty of all</HI>; And then he that Neglects his Obedience to any one of God's Commands knowingly &amp; willfully, will be lookt upon and treated by Almighty God as if he had Fulfill|ed none of them.

<P>BUT the common Pretence and Excu&s;e that hinders Men from coming to this Sacra|ment, is, That they are not &s;it for it, and they are afraid of Eating &amp; Drinking unworthily, &amp; of incurring their own Damnation thereby.

<P>And &s;ince in celebrating this Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are to renew and confirm this Covenant which we we have been &s;peaking of between God and us? This will abundantly direct what Preparation and Fitne&s;s is requi&s;ite, that we may be meet Partakers of it to our Profit and Comfort. And it is nece&s;&s;ary that we know what the Terms and Conditions of it are which God requires to be performed on our Parts, and what it offers and promi&s;es on God's Part.

<P>And al&s;o we mu&s;t, certainly, be very thank|ful to the Son of God at this Memorial of his Death, &s;ince he became the Mediator of this Covenant, and has by his Death procured the Favour of New Terms of Salvation, and the offer of Peace and Reconcilement with God upon &s;o gentle and ea&s;y Terms.</P>

<P>Who pitied us in the Mi&s;ery which we had madly pull'd upon our &s;elves which we had deeply de&s;erv'd! Who lov'd Sinners, the mo&s;t hateful things that are! Oh the wonder! that he &s;hould retain Kindne&s;s, and think Thoughts of Love towards us after the Abu&s;e of great creating Love; to us who are altogether unpro|fitable to him! who&s;e Happine&s;s is not at all nece&s;&s;ary, nor can make any addition to his! He had been eternally happy, if we had been for ever lo&s;t and mi&s;erable: Yet he would not &s;ee us lo&s;t; he afforded his help, when all other help utterly failed us, and we mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed, if he had not helped us.</P>
<P><HI>But go on,</HI> my Soul, for the way is &s;till plea|&s;ant, and &s;trowed with new and various de|lights; and con&s;ider too, in what way and me|thod this glorious Per&s;on the Son of God accom|pli&s;hed this great Salvation! what he under|took to do, and what to &s;uffer, that he might &s;ave thee.</P>
<P>Thou mu&s;t know then, that this excellent Per&s;on meditated and de&s;igned no le&s;s conde|&s;cen&s;ion, when he undertook to &s;ave thee, than
<PB N="46" REF="001954_0051_0FBA431AC6F41720">
to become man for thy &s;ake. He intended it then, and in the fulne&s;s of time &s;ubmitted to it. <HI>The word was made Fle&s;h.</HI> The Son of God took a Humane Nature, and became the Son of <HI>David</HI>: For he was born of a Virgin, who was of the Hou&s;e and Family of <HI>David</HI>: A Royal Family indeed; but in this branch of it, at ea&s;t, &s;unk into poverty and contempt. He who made the World, conde&s;cended to be made of a Woman! He who is Lord of Life and Glory, became &s;ubject to the Law that obliges Creatures! He whom the Angels account it their honour to attend and wor&s;hip, made him|&s;elf of no reputation, took upon him the form of a Servant, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the con|tempt and &s;corn of Men. O Son of God, how could&s;t thou endure to live upon this earth &s;o defiled with Sin, to conver&s;e with Sinneri? We mu&s;t needs wonder, that when thou wert in our guilty world, thou did&s;t not &s;hew thy terrible hatred and re&s;entment of the Sins of Men in &s;ending Plagues and De&s;ola|tions about the rebellious world. It is an amazement that thou &s;houlde&s;t here go about doing good! But this was thy con&s;tant prac|tice: It was glorious Love, O adorable Son of God, which brought thee down among us; and Love &s;pake in every Word of thine; Love attended all thy &s;teps; Love to mankind was exerci&s;ed in all thy Actions. What exceeding honour, gracious Lord, ha&s;t thou done our mean Nature, in taking it into a per&s;onal Uni|on with thy &s;elf! Thus ha&s;t thou exalted it above the Angels, and abundantly vindicated

it from the contempt of Devils; who fir&s;t de|filed, and then utterly de&s;pi&s;ed it: So low and mean is thy conde&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;o glorious our exaltation! Behold, my Soul, the Son of God become our brother! And as he is our brother, he does exalt us to become the Sons of God, together with him: And his Father becomes our Father. Oh, <HI>what manner of Love is this, that we &s;hould be called the Sons of God!</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Son of God to &s;ave mankind, that he took to him|&s;elf the humane nature: No, tho' this was much, yet he did more, much more than this. He undertook to die a Sacrifice for the Sins of men, which as God, he could not do; and therefore he became man, that he might be capable of dying: And in humbling, he <HI>hum|bled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cro&s;s.</HI> And here, if ever, my &s;oul, thou wilt be lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, in con&s;idering thy Saviours love to mankind&punc; Thou wilt &s;urely de&s;pi&s;e all things be&s;ide.

<P>Was it the Death of the Cro&s;s? Was my Sa|viour crucify'd? And what kind of Death was this; his Enemies, the unbelieving Jews, cho&s;e it for him, and the Heatheni&s;h <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers executed it. And this Death was the vile&s;t

and the mo&s;t ignominious one in the account of the <HI>Romans</HI>; &s;uch as they put none to but the mo&s;t contemptible Abjects, and the ba&s;e&s;t Malefactors. And this Death was, in the ac|count of the Jewi&s;h Law, an accur&s;ed one: he was reckoned accur&s;ed of God that was <HI>hanged on a Tree.</HI> But let me con&s;ider the Indignities, the contemptuous u&s;age which attended my Saviour's Death, and how painful and afflict|ing it mu&s;t needs have been to him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was condemned to die, he was committed to rude Soldiers who made it their &s;port to injure and abu&s;e him.

I grieve for thy Injuries, and am afflicted with thy pain! After this they platted a Crown of Thorns, and forced it, to make it &s;it fa&s;t up on his Head wounding and tearing thereby his Sacred Tem|ples; and then, my Soul, had I been there, I might have &s;een his own Blood running down and di&s;gui&s;ing his Ble&s;&s;ed Face, Oh what an di&s;gui&s;e of that Maje&s;ty and Meekne&s;s, of that venerable Sweetne&s;s, that awful goodne&s;s which had always dwelt there! They then found out &s;ome contemptible Purple Garment, and put it on him, and put a Reed in his Hand to imitate a Scepter; and then mockt him with the bowing the knee before him, and cry|ing, <HI>Hail King of the Jews.</HI> And to &s;hew how little Honour or Reverence they intended him in this, they mo&s;t di&s;dainfully &s;pit in his Face,

and buffeted him about, among them, from one to another: And with out doubt, he thought him&s;elf the wittie&s;t of the Company, who could devi&s;e the greate&s;t Affront. Thus was he injur'd and abus'd, who came into this World on the Kind De&s;ign of &s;aving lo&s;t Sinners: Thus was the King of Glory, the King, not of the Jews only, but of Heaven and Earth, mockt and de&s;pi&s;ed by the vile&s;t of Men.</P>
<P>When they had tired them&s;elves with this barbarous Sport, and how much rather him? They put his own Cloaths on him again, and led him away to crucifie him. And on him they laid the heavy and ignominious burthen of his Cro&s;s, &amp; he mu&s;t carry a long way, the In&s;trument of his Shame and Death to the place of Exe|cution, but they had u&s;ed him too ill before to leave him &s;till able to carry &s;o heavy a Load; and after he had hardly carried it a little way, he fell under it.

and from his Feet; and heard his Enemies re|viling him there, what Re&s;entments would'&s;t thou have felt! Would not &s;o &s;ad an Object have made thy Tears keep pace at lea&s;t with the drops of his mo&s;t precious Blood?

When eve|ry Wound might be under&s;tood to &s;ay, Sinner, behold how I love thee: All this I endure for thee: How then &s;hould this Sacrament affect thee, which is a lively Memorial of his Death? What a deep &s;ence of thy Saviour's Love and Sufferings &s;hould this create in thee?

<P>But all this which afflicted his Body, was the lea&s;t part of the Sufferings he felt; he &s;uffe|r'd more, abundantly more, then all this in the Suffering of his Soul: For I mu&s;t con&s;ider fur|ther, that this Death of his was an accur&s;ed

O Je&s;u! Was I more dear to thee than thine own Life? Was I to be rather indul|ged than thine own Ea&s;e, and more to be re|&s;pected than thine own Honour; What am I, Lord? Oh, what is Man, that thou art thus mindful of him? There was never Love like thine; none but a God could love thus! Oh a|dorable My&s;tery! Oh Wonder of Wonders. Thy Greatne&s;s is un&s;earchable, thy Love is in|comprehen&s;ible, and thy ways are pa&s;t finding out! With profounde&s;t reverence I adore thy Incomprehen&s;ible Love: I leave off to fathom what I can never reach, and will give up my &s;elf to prai&s;e and admire for ever.</P>

<P>HAve I indeed given my kind and compa&s;&s;i|onate Saviour &s;o much Grief by my Sins, and &s;hall they give me none? <HI>Oh that my Head were Waters, and my Eyes a Fountain of Tears,</HI> to drench my filthy polluted Soul!

How am I fallen from the Dignity and Honour of my Creation; I was made little lower then the Angels by my bounteous Creator; but I have made my &s;elf more vile than the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. I was made &s;ubject to no Creature, not bound to pay any Homage or Service towards the glorious Angles, though made lower than them; but alas, I have made my &s;elf a Slave to the abject, Devil, I have refu&s;ed to &s;erve God my Maker and Friend, and have drudged for my mortal Enemy. Oh wretched Man that I am! I have &s;ought his Service, while I have declined thine; and run after his Temptations, while I have endeavoured to evade thy Commands. Oh, I have been forward to Evil, and backward to all that is Good: I have combined with my Soul's great Enemy, to ha&s;ten and increa&s;e my Damnation.</P>

art thom requited for all thy bounteous Love to Mankind! Who can conceive or ex|pre&s;s the vilene&s;s, the Enormity of Sin! Which is a Contempt of thy infinite Maje&s;ty, a Rebelli|on again&s;t thy unque&s;tionable Authority, and Abu&s;e of thy free Goodne&s;s, a Defiance of thy Almighty Power, a denial of thy incomparable Wi&s;dom, and an Affront to all thy Glorious Attributes: Which is contrary to that Honour and Homage whieh I owe thee as thy Creature. Wo is me that I &s;hould ever offend my Maker! So liberal and &s;o gracious a Father! Wo is me that I &s;hould &s;light and affront the Love of Je&s;us my Redeemer, as I have done in cheri&s;h|ing tho&s;e vile Sins that he came to de&s;troy&punc; Oh Je&s;us, at what a co&s;tly Rate ha&s;t thou lov|ed me, and merited my Love! And how loth, how &s;low am I to entertain the Love of thee: Thou ha&s;t loved, where thy Hatred has been de&s;erved; and I, vile wretch, have hated him that has infinitely de&s;erved my Love. Thy Love to me me has been a va&s;t Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and has cau&s;ed thy Humility and Aba&s;ement; yet woulde&s;t thou love the Unworthy: But my Love to thee would have been my Honour and Glory, my everla&s;ting Advancement; yet have I been unwilling to love thee. Wo is me, I have been ob&s;tinate in Wickedne&s;s! Oh, how have I grieved the Holy Spirit, in neglecting, re&s;i&s;ting, and oppo&s;ing his good and kind Mo|tions in my Soul; turning a deaf Ear to his gentle Admonitions, and refu&s;ing to be con|verted and healed, Oh my God, in our Sins we de&s;pi&s;e thy Will, and do our own! We di&s;own

In our Sins we prefer Earth before Heaven, the Creature before the Creator; and reckon there is more Happine&s;s in the enjoy|ing &s;ome of them, than in the Enjoyment of Thee, the infinite Fountain of Good.</P>
<P>Oh how vile, how enormous a thing is Sin! Who can &s;ufficiently hate it! I &s;ee O Lord, in the terrible Sufferings of my Saviour, thy migh|ty Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Sins of Men, and it terrifies me to think of it. I plainly &s;ee how odious they are to the Divine Purity; in that &s;o worthy and great a Per&s;on, he who is &s;o well and ju&s;tly beloved of the Father, was &s;orely afflicted by the Father him&s;elf, when he bore the Sins of Mankind. I &s;ee thy hatred, O Lord, again&s;t my Sins; I believe it very ju&s;t, and I cannot chu&s;e but hate them too, I will hence|forth <HI>hate every fal&s;e way, but thy Law will I love.</HI> I will love thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ho|line&s;s, and utterly abhor what is &s;o contrary to it, as my Sins. I will account it my greate&s;t Honour to conform to thee, and will abandon and be a&s;hamed to be found in the mo&s;t credi|table, or mo&s;t applauded Sins in the World. Henceforth will all Sin have a mo&s;t deformed and ugly Vi&s;age to my Eye; I &s;hall never think any one charming; I &s;hall never account any one worthy to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But when I con&s;ider, O Lord, the cour&s;e of my pa&s;t Life; when I look into thy Commands,

and compare with them my Thoughts, and Words, and Actions, Oh what a mortifying View does this Examination pre&s;ent me! Oh wretched Creature, I am confounded, I am fil|led with Indignation again&s;t my &s;elf, when I &s;ee how much I have had to do with this vile, this odious thing! Wo is me, and how many are my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions! They are, alas, <HI>more in number than the Hairs of my Head, and my Heart</HI> even <HI>fails me</HI> when I review them. I have &s;in|ned in every Age of my Life, ever &s;ince I could know or chu&s;e my Actions! Oh wretched Crea|ture, how early did I begin to Sin again&s;t thee! How many have been the unheeded Actions of my Life! The mo&s;t of which, I much fear, have been wicked, &s;ince they proceeded from one &s;o prone to do Evil as I. And how many more mu&s;t the Sins of my words in all likeli|hood have been, e&s;pecially while I did not &s;et any watch upon my Tongue, nor keep the door of my Lips. And when I think how ea&s;ie and abundantly the light Mind multiplies thoughts, I tremble to think how my vain, fooli&s;h, vici|ous Mind has multiplied Trangre&s;&s;ions too. Lord, <HI>who can under&s;tand his Errors</HI>! I am a|mazed at the Number of my Sins: I have &s;inned, alas, again&s;t thee in every Circum&s;tance and Condition of my Life. I have &s;inned in every Relation towards Men; not doing that Honour, not paying that Ju&s;tice, not exerci&s;ing that charity to my Neighbour which I ought. I can view none of thy Commands, but it calls to mind many Sins I have been guilty of. Very often have I repeated the &s;ame Sins; <HI>returning</HI> to

them, <HI>as the Dog to</HI> the filthine&s;s of <HI>his vomit</HI>; and, <HI>as the Swine wallowing in the mire.</HI> I have &s;inned again&s;t thy Law, and again&s;t the Go&s;pel: Oh, how cold reception have I given to the Offers of thy Grace and Mercy! How have I neglected the great Salvation! Trampled upon the Blood of the Covenant, and de&s;pi&s;ed my Saviour's dying redeeming Love! Oh how ma|ny of other Mens Sins have I been guilty of! By my ill Example; by giving them needle&s;s and unju&s;t Provocation; by tempting and al|luring them to Sin; by a&s;&s;i&s;ting what I ought to have hindred; by conniving where I ought have be&s;towed reproofs; and by countenancing and abbetting what I ought to have corrected and di&s;couraged. I cannot, alas, pretend to have done any good Action without a Mixture of Evil in it: My be&s;t Works need the Blood of Chri&s;t to clean&s;e them, and make them fit to be pre&s;ented unto thee: And indeed I want that Blood to wa&s;h even the Tears of my Re|pentance. What a mighty Charge am I able to draw up again&s;t my &s;elf! [<HI>Here thou may'&s;t particularly mention tho&s;e Sins thou art &s;en&s;ible of</HI>] But thou, O Lord, knowe&s;t me better than I do my &s;elf; and I dread to think how much more thou can&s;t add to the heavie&s;t Charge that I can bring again&s;t my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I have been &s;o vile as to Sin deliberately a|gain&s;t thee; to do Evil, knowing that I did Evil. I have been ea&s;ily induced to Sin; the &s;lighte&s;t Temptations have prevailed with me; I have been, alas, accu&s;tomed to do Evil. O Lord, thou ha&s;t exerci&s;ed wonderful Patience

<P>O wretched and vile Creature that I am, I have greatly &s;inned, I am become exceeding guilty! What &s;hall I &s;ay unto thee; Oh thou pre&s;erver of Men. I will lay my&s;elf down in the Du&s;t before thee. I am at thy Mercy, O Lord, and mu&s;t own that I have de&s;erved the utmo&s;t &s;everity of thy Wrath. In the &s;ad Suf|ferings of Je&s;us I &s;ee what my Sins have de&s;erv|ed. I &s;ee in his Contempt how I have de&s;erv|ed to be de&s;pi&s;ed. I &s;ee in his Thir&s;t upon the Cro&s;s how I have de&s;erved the want of all things comfortable. I &s;ee in his Agony, and by his Groans under the Divine Wrath, what Di&s;plea&s;ure and Puni&s;hment I have de&s;erved to &s;uffer. I &s;ee in his accur&s;ed Death that I have de&s;erved to die, and be Eternally accur&s;ed and ca&s;t out of the Divine Favour. O Lord, I am unworthy, utterly unworthy to breath in this Air of thine, to inhabit this Earth; to enjoy this chearful Light. I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all thy Mercies. I mu&s;t judge, I mu&s;t con|demn my &s;elf, I mu&s;t own thou wert ju&s;t, and I &s;hould have but my de&s;erts, if I were now &s;hut up in gloomy darkne&s;s; if I were now wrapt in everla&s;ting Flames; if I were feeling the Torments of the never-dying Worm, and of endle&s;s bitter De&s;pair.</P>
<P>Lord, I will puni&s;h, I will take vengeance on my &s;elf for my Sins. I will lead a life of Mor|tification

<P>I Believe there is only one true and living God; who is the Father, the Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; an infinite, eternal, perfect being; the Maker and Pre&s;erver, Owner and Governour of all things. Who has right to the Homage, Wor&s;hip and Obedience of Mankind: Who

has laid upon us his Laws, and takes notice of our Behaviour; that his eyes behold all the Dwellers upon Earth, and try the children of men; That he is always nigh to every one of us, for it is in him that we live, move, and have our being. I believe, O Lord, that thou <HI>art, and art a Rewarder of tho&s;e that diligently &s;eek thee:</HI> Thou ha&s;t appointed a day wherein thou wilt judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and render to every man according to his works: That tho&s;e who are found wicked in that Day &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, but the righteous into Life Eternal.</P>
<P>But I believe al&s;o, that <HI>to the Lord our God belong Mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es, though we have rebelted again&s;t him,</HI> if in the way of his ap|pointment we &s;eek his pardoning Mercy.

The exceeding vilene&s;s, and the unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of our Sins, do magnifie thy Mercy beyond all comprehen&s;ion and prai&s;e.

Oh how &s;ad is it to think of Thou&s;ands of Peo|ple going down alive into the Pit, &s;wallow'd up by &s;udden Earthquakes, and in a moment &s;natch'd hence into Eternity, without any time to prepare for their Departure. How it grieves me to think of the &s;ad Effects of pi|ning Famine in &s;ome Places; of infectious and pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;es in others. It wounds my Soul to con&s;ider the woful Calamities and De|&s;olations that attend horrid Wars! Oh how deplorable a thing is it that Men &s;hould &s;eek to &s;pill the Blood of Men, and give the Car|ca&s;&s;es of their own Kind for a Prey to Birds and wild Bea&s;ts. Lord, rebuke the proud Di|&s;turbers of the World, abate their Pride, a&s;|&s;wage their Malice, and confound their De|vices. Grant that Wars may cea&s;e in all Lands, and gentle Love and happy Peace abound! Pro&s;per, good Lord, tho&s;e that endeavour for a ju&s;t and &s;afe Peace, that they may attain it: and <HI>&s;catter thou the People that delight in War.</HI> Oh that thy Judgments which are abroad in

the Earth, might make the Inhabitants of the World to learn Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and turn them|&s;elves to thee who ha&s;t &s;mitten them, that thou may&s;t heal them.</P>
<P>As a Member of thy ble&s;&s;ed Church I am particularly concern'd for the Tranquility and peace, and the true Spiritual Glory and pro&s;per|ity of that. O Lord, purge out of thy Church whatever does di&s;plea&s;e thee, and is de&s;tructive to the Souls of men. Purge out of it whatever is an Offence to tho&s;e without: Po&s;&s;e&s;s all Chri&s;t|ians with this, that they are oblig'd to Endea|vour that their carriage may adorn &amp; recommend their Religion in the &s;ight of the Infidels; and to take care their <HI>Light may &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they &s;eeing their good works, may Glo|rifie their Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Purge thy Church, we pray thee, from all fal&s;e Doctrines and Here&s;ies; from profane&s;s and Per&s;ecution; from Super&s;tition and Cruelty; from Envy, Ha|tred, Malice, and all uncharitablene&s;s. Bring in|to the way of truth all &s;uch as have erred, and are deceivied: Rai&s;e up them that are fallen; con|firm, and &s;trengthen tho&s;e that &s;tand in Piety and Vertue, and Profe&s;&s;ion of the Truth, Com|fort tho&s;e Parts of thy Church that mourn, and are oppre&s;t under a barbarous Per&s;ecution: And let thine own Right Hand, and Holy Arm, in thy due time, give them a mighty Salvation.</P>
<P>O God of Love, O Prince of Peace, and God of Order, we pray thee, let thy Go&s;pel pro|mote the&s;e good things in thy Church. Grant that there may be <HI>no hurting nor destroying in all thy Holy Mountain</HI>: That all the Members

<P>O Je&s;u, King of Love, &s;ill with thy kind and gentle Spirit all Chri&s;tian Kings, Princes, and Governours. Let no proud wrath, no malicious Envy, no greedy Covetou&s;ne&s;s, no turbulen Ambition reign in any of them: Grant that they all, knowing who&s;e Mini&s;ters they are, may above all things &s;eek thy Hon|our and Glory: And that they may &s;tudy to pre&s;erve the People committed to their Care in Wealth, Peace and Godline&s;s.

<P>E&s;pecially, O Lord, we intreat thee to regard with peculiar Favour, thy Servant <HI>GEORGE,</HI> our mo&s;t Gracious King. Let thy Wi&s;dom direct him in all his Admini&s;trations; thy Al|mighty Pov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> promote his good De&s;igns, that under him we may be Godly and Quietly go|vern'd.

<P>Pour down an Abundance of thy Spirit, we pray thee, O gracious Je&s;u, upon all Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors of thy Church. Repleni&s;h them with all right and &s;ound Knowledge, and a true Under&s;tanding of thy Word. Oh let not their Hearts be governed, or their Actions be guided by the De&s;igns of Covetou&s;ne&s;s or Ambition: but do thou po&s;&s;e&s;s and rule them by a great Zeal for thy Glory, and for thy great De&s;ign, the Salvation of Souls: Grant that they may by their Holy Doctrine, and an&s;werable Lives, be mightily &s;ucce&s;sful in turning many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that they may &s;ave them|&s;elves, and many of tho&s;e that are committed to their Charge.</P>
<P>Since my Goodne&s;s, O Lord, extends not to thee; and thou art above the receiving of any Advantage by the be&s;t returns that I can make for all thy Bounty to me: It &s;hall be my Charge and Care to requite thy Kindne&s;s upon thy Ser|vants to whom I may be profitable. I will love them, O Lord, that love thee, and do all the Good I can, to tho&s;e e&s;pecially that <HI>are

O Lord, I mu&s;t acknowledge it is but too nece&s;&s;ary for me to renew the Obliga|tions which I am &s;o apt to tran&s;gre&s;s.

O Lord, I am infinitely unworthy to come &s;o near thee: Yet it &s;eems, thou do&s;t not regard my un|worthine&s;s, el&s;e thou would&s;t never have invited me. Thou invite&s;t poor &s;inful Creatures in gene|ral to this Feast; thy Gue&s;ts can be none but &s;uch: if all therefore that are unworthy to come, &s;hould ab&s;ent them&s;elves, none of us would be there; and thy va&s;t and kind Preparations would be in vain; I come therefore, mo&s;t gracious God, in Obedience to thy Command and Invitations. But I will come with the lowliest Reverence and Hu|mility; for thou ha&s;t regard unto the lowly: I will come as a returning Prodigal, for thou art willing to receive &s;uch. I will come, hoping in thy infinite Mercy; for there is Mercy with thee, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My great Concern, O Lord, is that I may be in &s;ome good mea&s;ure fit to approach thee, though I can never be worthy; and that I may have and exerci&s;e tho&s;e Qualifi|cations in my attendance on thee which are &s;uit|able to this Sacrament, and which thou require&s;t.

<P>THanks be to God we have &s;o good Provi|&s;ion made by our Church for the Admi|ni&s;tration of this ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament; that any good Soul may receive it with great Devotion and Comfort, who will but &s;eriou&s;ly attend to what is appointed to be &s;aid and done in that Admini&s;tration; as indeed many &s;uch Souls: <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to it, have found by very Comfort|able Experience: Upon which account it were much to be de&s;ired, and very advi&s;able that tho&s;e who are wont to attend this way but once in a Year, when they enter into an of|fice, would per&s;wade them&s;eves to come more frequently to it, that they might do &s;o with the more comfort and advantage to their Souls when that occa&s;ion requires them to do it: For the whole bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o order'd, that 'tis very apt and fit to &s;tir up in us the lively and vigorous Exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e Graces which
<PB N="90" REF="001954_0095_0FBA43844FF5CCD8">
are required to attend it. So that the be&s;t Ad|vice which can be given for our due and pro|fitable Behaviour at the Holy Communion is this: That the Communicant do very clo&s;ely attend to what is order'd to be &s;aid and done by him that Mini&s;ters, or by the Communicant him&s;elf, while they are upon this duty.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the Communicants, e&s;pecially where the Number is great, (as I wi&s;h it were every where) will have &s;ome &s;paces wherein they may employ them&s;elves in &s;ome private Ejaculations and Devotions; I &s;hall not think it contrary to the propo&s;ed Brevity of this Book to afford them &s;ome &s;uch Devout Prayers and Ejaculations as they may u&s;e; and I &s;hall put them in their proper Places. But the&s;e mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">monly very &s;hort, that they may not be diverted from joining with the Publick Office.</P>
<P>To begin then, where we u&s;ually begin this Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>When He that Mini&s;ters is reading tho&s;e Sentences of Holy Scripture, which are de&s;ign'd to Exhort and Encourage the making our Of|ferings to Almighty God: While you have your Offering in your hand, or when you have given it, &s;ay,</P>
<P><HI>O Lord of Heaven and Earth, Maker and Owner of all Things! All that I hvae and am is from Thee, &amp; all is Thine. Thou do&s;t give, and thou ha&s;t right to take and u&s;e what thou plea&s;e&s;t of it: I humbly pre&s;ent This according to my Ability; as an Acknowledgement of thy right in me, and in all that I have; and of thy Bounty in giving it. I pre&s;ent, and I humbly intreat Thee to accept This as a token and Pledge of the Dedi|cation of my &s;elf, and all that I have, to &s;erve and honour Thee. Sprinkle me, O Lord Je&s;us, and this my

duty with thy precious Blood, and obtain for me, by thy Merits, a great Encrea&s;e of all Spiritual Gifts and Graces to thy Glory and my Salvation.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>When the Offerings are all receiv'd and &s;et upon the Altar: He that Mini&s;ters proceeds to make Interce&s;&s;ions to God for the Whole State of Chri&s;t's Church Militant here on earth: In which it becomes every Devout Soul, as a liv|ing Member of than Church, to join with him with very hearty Affections.</P>
<P>After this He proceeds to the immediate Exhortation, which is de&s;ign'd to deter all tho&s;e from drawing near to this Holy Ordi|nance, who are con&s;cious to Them&s;elves that they have been negligent to prepare for it; &amp; who live in any known Sin. And then it goes on to Encourage tho&s;e Humble Penitents, and Faithful Souls, who have been careful to pre|pare Them&s;elves; and to excite in them tho&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions with which they ought to come. It will be very proper for the Communicant, while the Mini&s;ter is reading this, to join with Him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to turn it into a Prayer.</P>
<P>In the next Place you are to join with the Mini&s;ter with Humility and true Godly Sor|row in a Confe&s;&s;ion of Sins, and to receive by Him Gods Ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>To the Sentences of Holy Scripture which He next recites to encourage our Faith and Hope in God, it may be proper to make in your Hearts &s;ome &s;uch An&s;wers as the&s;e,</P>

<P>An&s;wer. <HI>Be thou, O Je&s;us the Righteous, my Powerful Advocate with the Father: O Father, accept of his Death as a Propitiation for my Sins.</HI></P>
<P>To what the Mini&s;ter &s;ays next, you are to make the An&s;wers directed, and to join with Him in the Prai&s;es and Prayers following</P>
<P>After the Bread and Wine is by Prayer of Con&s;ecration &s;et apart to repre&s;ent the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t; and the Mini&s;ters are re|ceiving, you mu&s;t look upon the Elements with an Holy, Awful Reverence, and &s;adly call to mind the Scourging, the Buffetings, the Crown of Thorns, the cruel Nails and &s;pear which wounded and brui&s;ed, which tore and kill'd the Loving Je&s;us: You may remember the more terrible Sufferings and &s;harp Agonies of his Soul; which he endur'd e&s;pecially when He made his Life an Offering for Sin. And you &s;hould call to mind it was for your Sins that gave Him all the&s;e Sufferings and Griefs; that yet He endur'd them for your Advantage And he was Scourged, that by His &s;tripes you

<P>And now, my Soul, thou mu&s;t con&s;ider too the mighty obligation he has laid upon thee.

than thou art able, or will ever be call'd to &s;uffer for his &s;ake? And wilt thou &s;uffer no|thing for him? Was his way to heaven in|cumbred with &s;harp thorns, and will it become thee to murmur if thine be not &s;trow'd with ro&s;es?

The&s;e de&s;ires cannot become thee. It is enough for the di&s;ciple to be as his ma&s;ter; and &s;urely 'tis an honour that the &s;ervant be as his Lord, If thou wilt be a follower of Je&s;us, thou mu&s;t expect, as the world hated him, &s;aw no form or comeline&s;s in him; &s;o it will hate, and it will &s;corn thee: It will not &s;ee any thing to admire in thee.

forgiven him, &s;hould love much; and love will not let thee do any thing willingly, that is &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing and hateful to the kind and holy Je&s;us, as the lea&s;t Sin would be. Con&s;ider, thy &s;ins were pardon'd to oblige thee to for|&s;ake them for ever; and this does greatly oblige thee to it: It were horrid and mon|&s;trous ingratitude then, if the pardon of what is pa&s;t &s;hould encourage thee to begin a new &s;core. O abhor the thoughts of this, and reckon thou art oblig'd to live with great care of thy &s;elf, to take great heed to thy ways, to &s;hun even the appearances of evil, to abhor and avoid all temptations to wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my Soul, the Holy Spirit is come to dwell with thee; to con&s;ecrate thee to be a &s;acred Temple to him&s;elf! O divine gue&s;t! O how great is thy honour and thy happine&s;s! Wilt thou not let him know, that thou do&s;t account it both? Wilt thou not &s;tudy to be ea&s;y to &s;uch a gue&s;t? To &s;hew him the greate&s;t re&s;pects? Know then, that he mu&s;t rule in thy heart; he mu&s;t be, not in compli|ment only, but in reality ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. He is honourable enough, &s;urely, to have &s;uch re|&s;pect done him: And it will be thy advantage to give it him. And thou mu&s;t take care, that thou never admit thy lu&s;ts and vile affec|tions again: He will not dwell with &s;uch vile company; if thou would&s;t retain the hap|pine&s;s of his pre&s;ence, they mu&s;t be for ever bani&s;h'd from thy Soul: And &s;ure it would be very ea&s;y for thee to &s;ee, 'tis not fit that they &s;hould be allow'd &s;o much as a competition with him.</P>

<Q><P N="1">I. O Mo&s;t great and glorious God! Lord of Heaven and Earth, infinite in Ma|je&s;ty &amp; Glory, and in thy Greatne&s;s un&s;earch|able. And as thy Greatne&s;s is infinite, &s;o is al&s;o thy Goodne&s;s; which thou ha&s;t exer|ci&s;ed in a manner &s;uitable to thy excellent Greatne&s;s: For thou art in all things like thy &s;elf, and there is none be&s;ides thee like un|to thee. In wondrous Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s ha&s;t thou made the World, bounteou&s;ly communicating Being and Happine&s;s among thy Creatures. But thy Goodne&s;s has pe|culiarly &s;hown it &s;elf in thy dealing with Mankind, and appear'd in amazing Glories. It appears within us, and in all things that are round about us. Thou ha&s;t made Man a Noble Creature, little lower than the An|gels.

Thou did&s;t endow him with thy glori|ous Image in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holi|ne&s;s Thou crowned&s;t him with honour and dignity, giving him dominion over all the works of thy hands. Thou ha&s;t built this beauteous world for his habbitation, and plentifully furni&s;h'd it with all things nece&s;&s;ary and delightful to him. All our &s;en|&s;es pre&s;ent us with many in&s;tances of thy goodne&s;s to us, the earth is full of it; day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge of this.

<P>But this, O Lord, is that which we mu&s;t, with &s;hame and &s;elf abhorrence, accu&s;e our &s;elves of. All thy Goodne&s;s, and the Obliga|tions of it, were &s;oon forgotten by our Fir&s;t Parents, and they rebell'd again&s;t thee: And we are their true and vile Off-&s;pring, going a&s;tray from the Womb, living in Enmity a|gain&s;t thee, and de&s;pi&s;ing thy Command|ments. All the Wickedne&s;s of the World, and the Affronts ha&s;t received from it, thou did&s;t fore&s;ee; and yet of thy great Patience and Forbearance did&s;t &s;pare our fir&s;t Parents, and permit them to propagate their ba&s;e and corrupt nature!

When we were all guilty before thee, and obnoxious to thy eternal wrath; and thy honour, and thy ju&s;tice did require our utter rejection and perdition: Yet even then did then did thy wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s contrive and afford us a way and means of Salvation: And thy infinite greatne&s;s, tho' &s;o exceeding|ly affronted, did conde&s;cend to a concern to &s;ave us I and a way was found out &s;uitable to thy greatne&s;s and our nece&s;&s;ity. Even then did God the Father &s;o love the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believes in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life: And then did God the Son, in his infinite compa&s;&s;ion to mankind, offer him&s;elf to be our Mediator; and he under|took to purcha&s;e for us the divine favour which we had lo&s;t, at the co&s;t of his own aba&s;ement, in taking our nature, and dying a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of men. O how un|wearied, Lord, has thy kindne&s;s and mercy been towards us! And how odious and dete&s;table are all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ons again&s;t thee!
