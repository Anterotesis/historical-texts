<Q>&mdash;"THAT is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAD the &s;overeign Lord of life &s;elected for death me, who am &s;peaking to you, in&s;tead of him who was your pa&s;tor, and my "fellow-laborer, and com|panion, in the kingdom and patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t," he would, I doubt not, have been concerned, that &s;uch a providence might have quickened his care in preparing to follow after in his turn. And had he
<PB N="6" REF="010254_0004_0F7E25D900A3D950">
been called to preach upon my departure out of the world, as I am upon his, I can|not &s;uppo&s;e but he would have taken occa|&s;ion from &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation to put his hearers in mind of their own end; urging them to con&s;tant diligence, in the u&s;e of all means, that they might get and keep them&s;elves in readine&s;s for it. This is cer|tainly the voice of heaven in the affecting in&s;tance of mortality we are invited this day to lament before God: And it very loudly and &s;olemnly calls to us all. "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." And may the voice of &s;o &s;triking an article in the conduct of God not only enter into our ears, but into our hearts! that it may have an abiding good effect upon our lives.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I &s;hall employ your meditations on the well adapted, important words of the wi&s;e and in&s;pired Solomon, which have been ju&s;t read to you; taking occa&s;ion from them to con&s;ider death as "the end of all men," and to explain and urge the duty of "laying to heart" this &s;e|rious and affecting truth.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010254_0005_0F7E25D96CA7B788">
THE wi&s;e man had been &s;peaking of "the hou&s;e of mourning;" and he &s;ub|joins thereupon the awakening ob&s;ervation in the former part of my text, <Q>that is the end of all men.</Q> His meaning is, that death is the common fate of the whole hu|man race; that we may all as certainly ex|pect to die, and to be carried to the grave, as tho&s;e who&s;e funerals we are at any time called to attend.</P>
<P>ONLY, let it be carefully remembered here, his thus &s;peaking of death, as "the end of all men," is not to be under&s;tood as favoring the notion of tho&s;e, who &s;uppo&s;e that death puts a "final period to man's exi&s;tence." Such an interpretation of his words would be a contradiction, not only to the general doctrine of the Bible, but to the doctrine of this royal preacher him&s;elf in this very book; which is, that "the &s;pirit of a man," when he dies, "goeth up|wards," that is, to God, that God, who, as he &s;ays, "will bring every work into judg|ment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010254_0006_0F7E25D9D9C52718">
HE does not therefore call death "the end of all men," becau&s;e it puts an end to their being; but becau&s;e it terminates their &s;tate in this world; introducing them into a new and different manner of exi&s;tence. Death is their "end," not as they cea&s;e, by means of it, to be any more at all; but as it de&s;troys their pre&s;ent mode of life, with all the connections therewith, and depen|dances thereon, &s;o far as they relate to this lower world.</P>
<P>THE human &s;ystem is a mo&s;t curious piece of divine workman&s;hip. It con&s;i&s;ts of two e&s;&s;entially different parts, a "body" that is wonderfully put together, and ren|dered capable, by means of its various or|ganization, of a great many valuable purpo|&s;es; and a "&s;oul" that is furni&s;hed with powers of a more noble and excellent na|ture, &s;uch as thinking, rea&s;oning, reflecting, and perceiving both plea&s;ure and pain, with admirable variety, in kind and degree, al|mo&s;t without end. Between the&s;e two, though quite different from each other, there is <Q>&s;o intimate a relation as to con&s;titute one per&s;on, or living agent. And &s;uch is
<PB N="9" REF="010254_0007_0F7E25DA940E2BA8">
their mutual dependance, that the "mind" perceives for the whole body, cares for all its members, and directs all its motions: And, on the other hand, the "corporeal organs" convey to the mind the knowledge of ex|ternal objects, and are the fit in&s;truments of its active powers.</Q> This is our frame, and thus we live in the world. In con&s;equence of the&s;e wonderfully formed "bodies" and "&s;ouls," and the clo&s;e union there is be|tween them, we become capable of all tho&s;e employments and enjoyments, whether bodily or mental, &s;ecular or religious, wherein con|&s;i&s;ts the benefit of life, and in the due pro|portioning and regulating of which lies its perfection and glory in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, and its preparation for the en&s;uing one. Now death puts an end&mdash;to what? To the relation there is between &s;oul and body, and their mutual &s;ub&s;erviency to each other, and every thing dependant thereon. No more plea&s;ure is conveyed by the eyes, or ears, or any other of the organs of &s;en&s;ation; no more ideas are introduced into the mind from external nature, at lea&s;t in the u&s;ual way: Nay, the mind it&s;elf can no longer exert any of its powers by the mediation of the body. There is now an end put to all the labors, bu&s;ine&s;&s;es,
<PB N="10" REF="010254_0008_0F7E25DB50629098">
and amu&s;ements of the pre&s;ent life; to all the &s;atisfactions ari&s;ing from external objects, from friend&s;hips, from relations, or &s;ocial communications of any kind; yea, even our very thoughts, depending on the body, do now peri&s;h, together with all our de&s;ires and wi&s;hes, all our projections and contri|vances, whether for our&s;elves or others.</P>
<P>THIS now is the "end" which death brings upon "all men." It at once puts a period to all our plea&s;ures as well as pains, to all our hopes as well as fears, to all our con|nections, di&s;tinctions, and callings, whether civil or religious.</P>
<P>PERMIT me here to make a pau&s;e, and put you in mind of the obligations of love and gratitude you are under to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' who<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is we have the hope of a glorious immortality, notwith&s;tanding all that death can do to deprive us of life. Though death, which is the common lot of all men, will "end" our being in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, di&s;&s;olv|ing the union between our &s;ouls and bodies, and rendering us ab&s;olutely incapable of per|ception and enjoyment from any thing in this lower world; yet, thanks be to God, it will
<PB N="11" REF="010254_0009_0F7E25DDF6404288">
not de&s;troy our exi&s;tence as "living agents." For we are taught, in "the go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God," which has "brought life and immortality to light," that the "&s;oul" &s;ur|vives the funeral of the body, and is intro|duced, by means of death, into another &s;tate, wherein it exerts its active powers in a new and different way, tho' quite unknown to us at pre&s;ent: Nay, we are a&s;&s;ured in the &s;acred books, particularly tho&s;e of the new te&s;ta|ment, that the "end" which death puts to the relation between our &s;ouls and bodies, in con&s;equence of which our bodies are no longer animated with life and activity, but gradually fall to pieces, and crumble into common earth: I &s;ay, we are a&s;&s;ured, in the books of revelation, that this di&s;union, which death makes, &s;hall not la&s;t always; but that the time is coming, and ha&s;tens apace, when our &s;ouls and bodies &s;hall be again united to exi&s;t in this union in the eternal world. Says our Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "The hour is com|ing, in the which all that are in their graves &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and &s;hall come forth." And they who have done well, approving them&s;elves his true di&s;ciples, and faithful followers, &s;hall come forth to enjoy an immortal life of happine&s;s. This
<PB N="12" REF="010254_0010_0F7E25DEDF97D848">
is clearly and fully certified to us by the Apo&s;tle Paul in the&s;e words, "We look for a Savior, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall change our vile body that it may be fa&s;hion|ed like unto his glorious body." And again, "I his corruptible mu&s;t put on incorruption, and this mortal mu&s;t put on immortality. So when this corruptible &s;hall have put on incorruption, and this mortal &s;hall have put on immortality, then &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s the &s;aying, that is written, death is &s;wallowed up in victory. Thanks be to God for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' whom we obtain this victory."</P>
<P>LEL us, my brethren, relieve our minds under the &s;ad pro&s;pect of death, and tho "end" it puts to our being in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, with the hope the go&s;pel gives us, not only of another manner of exi&s;tence in our &s;ouls immediately after death, but of our ex|i&s;ting again both in &s;oul and body, and in a world where there will be "fullne&s;s of joy" forever. Only, let us take care to behave in the pre&s;ent life, &s;o as that our future immor|tality may be this happy and glorious one.</P>
<P>IT is a thought particularly worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious attention, that our exi&s;tence in
<PB N="13" REF="010254_0011_0F7E25DF79C058F8">
the &s;tate that is beyond the grave, and after the general re&s;urrection, will not be a ble&s;&s;ed one, unle&s;s, in this day of our trial, we be|come qualified, for tho&s;e employments and enjoyments that will make it &s;o. We &s;hall all live, 'tis true, notwith&s;tanding death, in the other world; "for as in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive:" But then, this life will be an happy one to tho&s;e only, who &s;o improve their pre&s;ent opportunities, powers and advantages, as to get formed to a meetne&s;s for the glories of the heavenly world.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND this leads me to explain and urge the duty &s;pecified, in the latter part of my text, "the living will lay it to his heart."</P>
<P>NOT that this is always the truth in point of fact. This cannot be the meaning of the words. One might be ready indeed to think, that &s;o common and certain a fate as death would be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered by all; e&s;pe|cially when they have placed before their view a &s;triking example of what will be their own ca&s;e in a very little time, at longe&s;t. But it is found to be far otherwi&s;e in experience, and by ob&s;ervation. Though we know not
<PB N="14" REF="010254_0012_0F7E25DFD1A866A8">
how &s;oon our friends and acquaintance may be called to attend our remains to the dark and &s;ilent grave; yet, we are &s;trangely inat|tentive to &s;o momentous an event. We do not "lay it to heart;" we are not affected with the con&s;ideration of it, &s;o as to "num|ber our days aright, applying our hearts to wi&s;dom," the wi&s;dom of being religious, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nding principally "the one thing needful."</P>
<P>WHEN therefore the wi&s;e man &s;ays, "the living will lay it to heart," his intention is, not to declare what they do in fact; but what they ought to do, and what they will do if they act as is befitting frail, dying creatures.</P>
<P>"THE living will lay it to heart," that is, they will, if they are wi&s;e, fix their thoughts upon their "la&s;t end;" making death the &s;pe|cial &s;ubject of their &s;erious and &s;olemn con|templation. That which is laid to heart engro&s;&s;es the attention. The mind is pen&s;ive, and in a manner taken up with the object before its view. One's thoughts are conti|nually running this way. If therefore "the end of all men" is what "lies upon our heart," we &s;hall, at proper times, e&s;pecially
<PB N="15" REF="010254_0013_0F7E25E097D6E7C0">
when called in the providence of God to la|ment the death of others, turn our thoughts from the things of time and &s;en&s;e, and em|ploy them in &s;erious con&s;ideration of that fatal period which death will put to the ex|i&s;tence of all men, and our own in &s;pecial, on this pre&s;ent &s;tage of action. Not that meer|ly thinking on the human frame, as that which will &s;hortly come to an "end" here, is all that is intended by "laying death to heart;" but this is one thing meant by it: for, that can never be &s;aid, with any propriety or truth, to be "laid to heart," which our minds are not intent upon, &s;o as that it is the &s;ubject of our engaged meditation.</P>
<P>"THE living will lay it to heart." Ano|ther thing, and the principal one here meant, is, that they will be &s;o affected with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of their "end" as to be put upon &s;uita|ble endeavours to get prepared for it. When any thing of a temporal nature "lies upon our heart," we do not re&s;t &s;atisfied barely with employing our thoughts about it; but are &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with concern, as to be urged on to that method of conduct which is ad|ju&s;ted to the object that engages our &s;ollici|tude. And, in this &s;en&s;e, "the living," if
<PB N="16" REF="010254_0014_0F7E25E150266640">
they are wi&s;e, "will lay the end of all men to heart." They wont content them&s;elves with a &s;light and tran&s;ient con&s;ideration of death, like "a man, who, beholding his face in a gla&s;s, &s;traitway forgetteth what manner of man he was"; but this &s;erious and im|portant truth will fill their minds, and excite in them a deep concern; &s;uch an one as will be practical, influencing them to a becoming care, in the u&s;e of all proper means, that they may be fitted for the great event of their dying, and leaving this pre&s;ent world.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, this "laying death to heart," in the &s;en&s;e the wi&s;e man u&s;es the phra&s;e, im|ports &s;uch an awakened vigorous attention to the affairs of our &s;ouls and another world, as will be effectual to di&s;engage us from our &s;ins, and put us upon "living in all good con&s;cience towards God." We &s;hall, if we are &s;uitably affected with "the end of all men," be active in our endeavours to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and daily to improve, every chri|&s;tian grace; abounding in all tho&s;e works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which, "by Je&s;us Chri&s;t are to the prai&s;e and glory of God." We &s;hall cheri&s;h no beloved &s;in, we &s;hall live in the neglect of no known duty; but &s;hall endea|vour
<PB N="17" REF="010254_0015_0F7E25E415EC1368">
to yield a &s;teady, uniform, chearful, uni|ver&s;al obedience to the divine precepts. We &s;hall, in a word, (for I may not enlarge) make it our earne&s;t care, that the &s;everal graces of faith, love, humility, meekne&s;s, patience, contentment, weanedne&s;s from the world, and re&s;ignation to the divine plea&s;ure, may have a real exi&s;tence in us, and di&s;cover that they have by their being thrown out in|to acts, as occa&s;ions may be offered therefor in the conduct of providence, to the glory of God, and our being in a pre&s;ent actual meetne&s;s for the approach of death, and an happy immortality by means of it.</P>
<P>THIS it is, and this only, that makes it fit and rea&s;onable, that our hearts &s;hould be en|gaged in thinking upon "the end of all men." If our attention to this &s;ubject does not awaken a concern in us, and &s;uch an one as will influence us to practical endea|vours that we may be ready for death, it will be to no religious purpo&s;e. This therefore, if not the only, is the principal &s;en&s;e, in which the in&s;pired Solomon is to be under|&s;tood, when he &s;ays, "the living will lay it to heart," that is, if they act up to their cha|racter as rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="010254_0016_0F7E25E490307C48">
LET me now urge both my&s;elf and you to this wi&s;dom of conduct, by making it our great care &s;o to think of our "end," as that we may be fitted for a glorious immortality beyond the grave. To be prepared for this, by getting formed in our minds the principles of piety towards God, faith in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and all the graces and virtues that con&s;titute and adorn the chri&s;tian character, &s;hould be our main bu&s;ine&s;s, the chief em|ployment of our lives in this world. And the &s;ooner we &s;et about this important work, the better: Nor &s;hould any of us dare to run the venture of procra&s;tinating in an affair that is &s;o nearly connected with our eternal welfare.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mayhew, &s;ome years ago, preached and publi&s;hed a volume of &s;ermons, his de&s;ign in which was, to "an&s;wer the pleas of delaying &s;inners," and to "excite them to &s;peed in turning their feet into the path of God's te&s;ti|monies." He has &s;aid every thing pertinent to the &s;ubject, and in a &s;erious, pathetic, and yet mo&s;t convincing man|ner. It were to be wi&s;hed, di&s;cour&s;es &s;o well adapted to put men upon in&s;tant endeavours that they may become religious, were more generally attended to.</NOTE> Young people e&s;pecially are apt to be guilty of this &s;olly; imagining that age is the time for &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s, the proper &s;ea&s;on to make preparation for death and the other world. They &s;uppo&s;e the evil day of death to be at a great di&s;tance, and think it is time enough hereafter to mind
<PB N="19" REF="010254_0017_0F7E25E5882BEF28">
their &s;ouls, and provide for their exi&s;tence in the future &s;tate.&mdash;But how knowe&s;t then, O vain young man, but that an "end" may be &s;oon put to your days here on earth? "There are," as we read in the book of Job, "that die in youth." And it is often &s;een to be the truth of fact, that "one dieth in his full &s;trength, being wholly at ea&s;e and quiet. His brea&s;ts are full of milk, and his bones are moi&s;tened with marrow." And &s;hould any of you be of that number that &s;hall be &s;elected for death in the prime and vigor of life, what a pitiful excu&s;e would it be for your neglect of your &s;ouls, and their everla&s;ting &s;alvation, that you hoped you &s;hould have lived till you were "full of days"! Oh! tis perfect madne&s;s in young people to depend upon life, e&s;pecially upon life protracted till old age, and &s;o to depend upon it as to live thoughtle&s;s of religion, and take no care to provide for their eternal du|ration in another world. Let me be&s;eech you to hearken to that advice of pious David to his &s;on Solomon, "Thou Solomon, my &s;on, know thou the God of thy father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind." And &s;uffer your mind to be impre&s;&s;ed with the powerful motives with
<PB N="20" REF="010254_0018_0F7E25E5DE4AF1A0">
which he enforces this advice, in the words that immediately follow, "For the Lord &s;earcheth all hearts, and under&s;tandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou &s;eeke&s;t him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake&s;t him, he will ca&s;t thee off forever." Be per&s;uaded al&s;o to attend to that exhorta|tion of Solomon him&s;elf, when he had pa&s;&s;ed through the age of youth, and was come to ripene&s;s of years; "Remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou &s;halt &s;ay I have no plea&s;ure in them."</P>
<P>MY being thus particular in &s;peaking to young people, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, may be a word in &s;ea&s;on, as they make &s;o great a part of this congregation. And I the rather thought there was a propriety in it, as, I know, your now decea&s;ed pa&s;tor was greatly concerned that your minds might, in early life, be &s;avingly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;e|rious &s;en&s;e of God, and the principles of ge|nuine chri&s;tianity. To this end he preached, but a few years &s;ince, a cour&s;e of excellent &s;ermons, "exhorting" you, the young peo|ple of his charge, "to be &s;ober-minded."

It was at the de&s;ire of many of you, &s;ignified to him in writing, that they were printed for your &s;piritual edification.

I heartily recommend them to your &s;erious, fre|quent, and con&s;iderate peru&s;al. They are admi|rably well adapted to inform your under&s;tand|ings, to awaken your pa&s;&s;ions and, by all the motives that can be fetched from this world or another, to engage your endeavours, to begin a religious cour&s;e of life betimes, and to go on in it all your days. It will be your own fault, if you are not per&s;uaded, by what you will meet with in them, to make it the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of your life to get formed to a readine&s;s for the world you are ha&s;tening to.</P>
<P>AND let this be the care of us all, be our age, &s;tation, or condition, what it will. There is nothing we can be urged to that more nearly concerns us. 'Tis an affair of ever|la&s;ting importance.</P>
<P>ARE we any of us con&s;cious to our&s;elves, that we have all along, even to this day, lived thoughtle&s;s of our "end," neglecting to make

preparation for it? Oh! what a wretched &s;tate are we in! And how can we be "at ea&s;e in Sion," when we know not how &s;oon, or &s;uddenly, a period may be put to our con|tinuance on the earth? Suppo&s;e the holy God &s;hould &s;peak to us in the language he did to one in the days of Chri&s;t, "this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee:" O the horror of mind we &s;hould be thrown into! When Bel&s;hazzar &s;aw "the hand-writing up|on the wall," though in the mid&s;t of his companions, and in the height of mirth and jollity, how was "his countenance changed"! And how did "his thoughts trouble him"! A lively emblem of the awful &s;urpri&s;e tho&s;e may be &s;eized with, who are overtaken by death, while they had no expectation of &s;uch an event, and had made no provi&s;ion for it. O how are they confounded, and amazed! What angui&s;h filleth their hearts! How cut|ting is the review of their pa&s;t neglects! How tormenting the &s;en&s;e of their lo&s;t op|portunities! And how does the reflection on their pa&s;t folly awaken their pa&s;&s;ions, alarm con&s;cience, and cau&s;e them to turn upon them&s;elves with the keene&s;t re&s;entments.</P>

&s;inner, &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by death, and &s;ent to the place of &s;eparate &s;pirits in the invi&s;ible &s;tate. To be turned out of the world with|out con&s;ideration of our latter end, and, being unprepared for it, to fall under the &s;entence of the &s;lothful and wicked &s;ervant, "ca&s;t ye the unprofitable &s;ervant into outer darkne&s;s," where there &s;hall be "weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth;" what more &s;hocking! what more terrible!&mdash;Who can expre&s;s the in&s;upportable agony of &s;uch a poor &s;oul! It &s;urpa&s;&s;es all language! It goes beyond the reach of conception!</P>
<P>BUT let us turn the pro&s;pect, and &s;uppo&s;e on the other hand, that we have "laid death to heart," have &s;o con&s;idered this "end of all men," as that we have been effectually en|gaged to "yield our&s;elves up to God" thro' Chri&s;t, to love him with all our hearts, and to &s;erve him with all our might, by a due u&s;e of our time, powers and talents:&mdash;In this view of the matter, how &s;afe is our condi|tion! What &s;ecurity may we feel in our thoughts! What peace in our con&s;ciences! What joy in our brea&s;ts! The mo&s;t &s;udden a&s;&s;ault by death would do us no harm, as being prepared for &s;uch an event. We

might have confidence towards God, when|ever, or in what manner &s;oever, we are called hence. And &s;hould the call be &s;udden, O how plea&s;ingly &s;hould we be &s;urpri&s;ed to perceive, that we were now "in the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeru&s;alem," a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect; with an innumerable company of angels; with the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in hea|ven; with Je&s;us the mediator of the new-covenant; and with God the judge of all!" And who is able to de&s;cribe the happine&s;s of that &s;tate we are now in! "Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into man's heart to conceive" of the greatne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>NOTHING beyond this can be &s;aid to urge upon us the duty of "laying the end of all men to heart." The in&s;pired books have propo&s;ed no higher motives to excite our hopes, and alarm our fears, that we might be rou&s;ed to action. And if we will be per|&s;uaded neither by the&s;e mercies, nor terrors of the Lord, we mu&s;t reap the fruit of our own folly. No arguments that are more powerful can be u&s;ed with us.</P>

I HAVE now done with my text; tho', I believe, you expect that I &s;hould, before I conclude, take &s;ome &s;pecial notice of the af|fecting occa&s;ion which gave ri&s;e to the pre|ceeding di&s;cour&s;e from it.

Nor will any &s;u&s;pect the truth of what I &s;ay, who are ac|quainted with the friend&s;hip there was be|tween us. This began upon his fir&s;t commen|cing a Preacher of the Go&s;pel, and has con|tinued ever &s;ince with mutual e&s;teem, confi|dence and delight. I will therefore "mourn in &s;ecret places", God's "putting far from me" &s;o good a friend, his "removing &s;o dear an acquaintance into darkne&s;s". This me|lancholly occurrence has, I am ready to think, excited in my brea&s;t like &s;en&s;ations of grief with tho&s;e which David felt upon the death of his beloved <HI>Jonathan;</HI> and I can, with all &s;incerity, lament over him in the pungent ex|pre&s;&s;ions of his afflicted heart, "I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for thee, my brother JONATHAN; very plea&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me".</P>

<P>"THE Father of &s;pirits" was plea&s;ed, in his di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s, to favor Dr. Mayhew with &s;uperior mental powers. Few &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him either in the quickne&s;s of his apprehen&s;ion, the clearne&s;s of his perception, the readine&s;s of his invention, the brightne&s;s of his imagination, the comprehen&s;ion of his under&s;tanding, or the &s;oundne&s;s of his judg|ment. And, together with the&s;e gifts of God, he was endowed with a &s;ingular great|ne&s;s of mind, fortitude of &s;pirit, and yet &s;oft|ne&s;s and benevolence of temper: all which, being enlarged and &s;trengthened by a good education, and the opportunity of free con|ver&s;e with men and books, &s;oon qualified him to make a con&s;iderable figure in the world; as he was hereby enabled to &s;peak and write with that freedom of thought, that

ju&s;tne&s;s of method, that &s;trength of argument, that facility of expre&s;&s;ion, that liveline&s;s of fancy, that purity of diction, and that appa|rent concern for the good of mankind, which procured him a name, both here and abroad, which will be remembered with honor long after his body is crumbled into du&s;t. It was this that made way for his corre&s;pondence beyond the great waters, which was daily in|crea&s;ing: And, had the wi&s;dom of God &s;een fit to have continued him in life, it might have been of great &s;ervice to his country as well as him&s;elf, if we may judge from what it has already been.</P>
<P>HE was eminently a friend to liberty both civil and religious.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His fir&s;t printed di&s;cour&s;es were upon the &s;ubject of LIBERTY. His view in them was, to a&s;&s;ert and maintain the RIGHT OF PRIVATE JUDGMENT. Few have wrote more copiou&s;ly, more elegantly, or more forceably upon this intere&s;ting point. If, in &s;ome in&s;tances, the Dr's imagination got the better of his judgment, betraying him into too warm and &s;atyrical expre&s;&s;ions, the candid will be di&s;po&s;ed to make all due allowances, con&s;idering his inexperience of the world, being then in his youthful days. It was this performance that fir&s;t &s;pread his &s;ame, and rendered him con&s;picuous as a writer, both here and abroad.</NOTE> And if his zeal, at any time, betrayed him into too great a &s;everity of expre&s;&s;ion, it was again&s;t the attempts of tho&s;e who would make &s;laves either of men's &s;ouls

or bodies. He nobly claimed that which he e&s;teemed equally the right of others, the liberty of thinking for him&s;elf: And he made u&s;e of all proper helps in order to his thinking right. He freely con&s;ulted the writings of men of all per&s;ua&s;ions, not omit|ing to read the works of &s;y&s;tematical divines, and metaphy&s;ical &s;choolmen; tho' he paid no regard to any thing he found in them, but in &s;ub&s;erviency to the &s;acred books of &s;crip|ture. The&s;e he firmly adhered to, as con|taining the revelations of God; making them the one only rule of his religious faith. "What &s;aith the &s;cripture"? was his grand enquiry; and, as his &s;entiments as a chri&s;tian and divine were the re&s;ult therefrom, he had the hone&s;ty and re&s;olution to preach and publi&s;h the truth in Chri&s;t, according to the apprehen&s;ion he had formed of it. If he differed from &s;ome others in a few points<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Two or three years ago a pamphlet appeared among us, under the name of an ob&s;cure per&s;on without re|putation, wrote either by him&s;elf, or a certain offici|cious lay-gentleman of his acquaintance, a&s;hamed or afraid to be known as its author, in which the Dr. was repre&s;ented as an <HI>enemy to the atonement by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> The real writer of that piece, whoever he was, knew little of the Dr, or the true meaning of his works.

they differed as much from him: Nor had they, on this account, any greater right to judge him, than he had to judge them; tho' he did not pre&s;ume to do this, as he tho't, with exact truth and ju&s;tice, that we have all one common Lord to whom we are ac|countable, and by who&s;e judgment ONLY we &s;hall either &s;tand or fall in the coming great day of tryal.</P>
<P>HE was an avowed enemy to all human e&s;tabli&s;hments in religion, e&s;pecially the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of meer ceremonial rites as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to chri&s;tian communion. And as he e&s;teemed this a direct u&s;urpation of that right which is proper only to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only &s;upreme head of the chri&s;tian church, it may be an excu&s;e for him, if he has ever expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with too great a degree of a&s;perity upon this head.</P>
<P>IT was highly offen&s;ive to him, when he perceived in any an evident breach of tru&s;t; e&s;pecially, if the tru&s;t related to the things of religion and another world. And as he had upon his mind a clear and full conviction, in common with many others, that this breach of tru&s;t was ju&s;tly chargeable upon a certain

re&s;pectable &s;ociety at home, tho' they might be led into it thro' repeated mi&s;informations from their corre&s;pondents here; it was this that gave ri&s;e to the &s;everal pieces he wrote upon this &s;ubject; in which he honored him|&s;elf, &s;erved the&s;e churches, and prevented the application of much of that charity for the propagation of Epi&s;copacy, which was in|tended for the propagation of chri&s;tianity. He has received acknowledgments from Eng|land on account of the&s;e writings, and from &s;ome of the Epi&s;copal per&s;wa&s;ion, who were fully with him in his &s;entiments upon the main point he had in view.</P>
<P>BESIDES what has been &s;aid, tho&s;e ac|quainted with the Dr. mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that manline&s;s of Spirit, that friendline&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, that freedom and chearfulne&s;s of temper, which rendered him agreable to tho&s;e who had the opportunity of conver&s;ing with him. They mu&s;t al&s;o have &s;een his amiable behaviour in the &s;everal relations of life. As a hu&s;band, how faithful and kind! As a fa|ther, how tender and affectionate! As a Ma&s;|ter, how ju&s;t and equal! knowing that he had a ma&s;ter in heaven. As a friend, how true to his profe&s;&s;ions! with what confidence

to be tru&s;ted in! As a neighbour, how ready to all the offices of love and goodne&s;s! In|&s;tead of being deficient, he rather exceeded in the acts of his liberality and charity. As a mini&s;ter, how diligent, how laborious, how &s;kilful! making it his care to contrive his di&s;|cour&s;es &s;o as to inform the mind and touch the heart, &s;o as at once to entertain and profit both the learned and the illiterate, the polite and le&s;s cultivated hearer. Few were able to compo&s;e their &s;ermons with &s;o much ea&s;e, and yet &s;o much pertinence; and few preached with greater con&s;tancy, or took occa&s;ion more frequently from occurrences in the con|duct of providence to make what he &s;aid &s;ea|&s;onable and profitable to his hearers.</P>
<P>BUT what is more than all that has been offered, he was, in the judgment of tho&s;e who be&s;t knew him, a man of real piety and true devotion, an upright &s;incere di&s;ciple and &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Was it proper to mention the time, manner and circum&s;tances of his becoming po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that faith in God and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which purified his heart, and became in him an habitual pow|erful principle of virtuous action, I doubt not but even tho&s;e would entertain a good

opinion of him as a real chri&s;tian, who may have been greatly wanting in their candor and charity towards him, becau&s;e, in &s;ome points, his tho'ts did not agree with their's. I have abundant rea&s;on to believe, from what I know of him, that it was his great endeavour to live in all good con&s;cience towards God and man. And &s;hould I appeal to you, the people of his charge, you would all, I doubt not, ri&s;e up and declare his approbation and practice of the "things that were true, ho|ne&s;t, ju&s;t, pure, lovely and of good report". You would appear as witne&s;&s;es and &s;ay, that he had been to you "an example in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in faith, in purity", and in all tho&s;e other virtues which adorn the chri&s;tian's and the mini&s;ter's character: Not that he was without his imperfections and failings. I know he had them, and he knew it too; and every one el&s;e knows that he has many infirmities, who, in any tolerable degree, knows him&s;elf. But he was uniform and &s;teady in his regards to the religion of Je&s;us; not placing it in "tythes of mint, annice and cummin", but the practice of "the weightier matters of the law, judg|ment, mercy and faith": Tho', after all, in|&s;tead of "tru&s;ting that he was righteous", in
<PB N="33" REF="010254_0031_0F7E25F40DBE8A18">
the &s;en&s;e of rigorous law, he e&s;teemed him|&s;elf "an unprofitable &s;ervant", and had his dependance on the mercy of God, thro' the mediation of the only Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In this temper he lived, and in the &s;ame tem|per, I believe, he would have died, had it plea&s;ed the alwi&s;e, righteous and holy Sove|reign of the world to have permitted the free u&s;e of his rea&s;onable powers. And he is now, as to his &s;oul or &s;pirit, we charitably believe, in that invi&s;ible world, which was the great object of his hope, and where he will be happy without any mixture of evil forever.</P>
<P>YOU, his dear relatives, entertain this tho't of him; and while this is your faith, how can you indulge to immoderate grief? Weep you may, but it ought to be for your&s;elves, not for him, who is beyond the reach of &s;in and &s;orrow, and has enter'd into the joy of his Lord.</P>

Her ca&s;e is pitiable. We could not blame her, if, in the agonies of her grief, &s;he &s;hould break forth in tho&s;e affecting words, "have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends!

<P>WE unite al&s;o in our prayers to the God of heaven for the Children, &s;o early in life, bereaved of their earthly father. Wherein could the holy God have more nearly touched them? What greater outward good could he have taken from them? What a guide would he have been to their childhood and youth? How careful would he have been of their education? E&s;pecially, that they might have been fitted to be ble&s;&s;ings in the world, and to do worthily in their generation? But, if their earthly parent would have been good to them, how much more will their father in heaven concern him&s;elf for their welfare; taking them under his &s;pecial guidance, even to death? Their &s;ollicitous mother may hope that he will, and it is our ardent prayer that he would: and &s;he may be encouraged in her hope, and we in our prayer, from the thought, that God has been plea&s;ed to make him&s;elf known under that endearing title, "the father of orphans", the God with

<P>INQUIRE each one of you, wherein you may have had an hand in bringing this evil upon your&s;elves.
