<P>_YOUR repeated reque&s;t, the rea&s;ons you have offer'd, together with the importunity of &s;ome other my Friends, have at length pre|vailed with me to grant you a Copy of that Sermon, I preach'd &s;ome time ago, at your Lecture: In doing which, I have preferr'd your judgment before my own; and have &s;ought to grati|fy you herein, rather than to plea&s;e my &s;elf.</P>
<P>For to me it appears, that I have little con&s;ulted my own Reputation herein. The World will cen&s;ure me, for ap|pearing at all in Print, who am but of ye&s;terday; and the Copy which I have here &s;ent you, is one, but ha&s;tily corrected, which &s;ome time ago I tran&s;cribed for the u&s;e of a private Per&s;on only; being by an extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence (of which you heard) pre|vented
<PB REF="003871_0003_10020827035B6BB8">
from preparing a more correct Copy for you, as I had given encouragement to do; however, I don't think it worth while for me to go about to excu&s;e my &s;elf, by telling under what di&s;advantages this comes forth; nor yet, by declaring to the World, my unwillingne&s;s to come into this. You Sirs, and other my Friends, know how the matter was; And I hope it now is, and ever will be, more my concern, that I be able to give a goal account to God, and my own Con&s;cience than to any Man on Earth.</P>
<P>I have made little alteration in this Copy from what you heard me preach; and doubt not, but that it is the truth, which I ought to teach and maintain, tho' it ap|pears in a very plain dre&s;s, and will find but a very indifferent reception with many. And indeed, your pious zeal and forwardne&s;s to promote the &s;preading &amp; e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of the&s;e Truths, in which you are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and built up, hath been a principal motive with me, to adventure thus to expo&s;e my &s;elf.</P>
<P>And I hope it will &s;till be your care, as well as mine, to do what you may for the propagating and maintain|ing the&s;e fundamental Truths, which are but growing out of fa&s;hion at this Day.</P>
<P>But if it will plea&s;e God (who can work by any means) by his Grace and Ble&s;&s;ing, to make this mean E&s;&s;ay &s;erviceable, for the promoting and e&s;tabli&s;hing of his Truth in the Minds and Hearts of any, that his great Name may have the Glory, and precious Souls the benefit, then your end in Printing, and mine in Writing, will be attain'd.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1. CORINTHIANS XV. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE great Subject which the Apo&s;tle is principally treating of in this Chap|ter, is the Doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> which he a&s;&s;erts and e&s;tabli&s;heth by &s;undry Arguments, principally drawn from the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, where|in having fir&s;t proved that Chri&s;t is certainly ri&s;en, he thence infers that the dead &s;hall certainly ri&s;e, which is an incon|te&s;table proof of the Re&s;urrection, e&s;pecially of all good Men; for Chri&s;t is their <HI>federal</HI> Head, they mem|bers of his <HI>Body my&s;tical,</HI> and if the Head be ri&s;en, it is certain the members &s;hall ri&s;e al&s;o; yea Chri&s;t's Re|&s;urrection is the earne&s;t and fir&s;t fruits of ours. Ver. 20. <HI>But now is Chri&s;t ri&s;en from the dead, and become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="003871_0005_100208293A37C348"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> from it, ver<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Death, by Man came al&s;o the Re&s;urrection of the dead.</HI></P>
<P>And he further illu&s;trates and confirms this in my Text, <HI>For as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive</HI>; i. e. as thro' the Sin of the fir&s;t Adam all Men became mortal, becau&s;e all derive from him the &s;ame &s;inful Nature;&mdash;&s;o through the obedience and merits of Chri&s;t, &s;hall all that are made partakers of the divine Nature, be made both alive and immortal. All that died, died in Adam, all that ever are made alive, are made alive in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But in the Words we may further,</P>
<P N="1">1. Ob&s;erve, The Per&s;ons treated of, <HI>viz</HI> Adam and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the fir&s;t and the &s;econd Adam.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve, That both are &s;poken or treated of, as publick Per&s;ons, Heads, or Repre&s;entatives. And this is evident from the form of the Apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning, wherein he &s;hews that Adam did not act in a &s;ingle capacity for him&s;elf alone, but as a publick Head for all mankind, therefore <HI>is it</HI> that all die in him; i. e. as in their publick Head: For in no other &s;en&s;e could they die in him. And that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>was and is</HI> &s;uch a publick Per&s;on, not only the Apo&s;tle here, but al&s;o the whole Go&s;pel witne&s;&s;eth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ob&s;erve, The <HI>influence,</HI> and <HI>effects,</HI> that the acts and doings of the&s;e publick Per&s;ons <HI>had,</HI> and <HI>have</HI> on tho&s;e they repre&s;ent and act for, viz. <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI> Adam conveys Death to all he acted for: Je&s;us Chri&s;t Life to all his. <HI>In Adam all die,</HI> i. e not only be|came guilty with him in the fir&s;t Sin conveyed to them in the channel of natural Generation, to the expo&s;ing all his progeny to temporal and eternal Death; but
<PB REF="003871_0006_100266E1D64D9C28">
the Phra&s;e al&s;o denote, the conveyance of &s;uch a co+ruption of Nature &s;o communicated to all who abide in him, as is daily working Death in them.</P>
<P>But now! the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t coming in as Man's &s;econd common and covenant Head, for his deliver|ance from this Death, and fulfilling both the penal and preceptive parts of the Law, hath hereby aboli&s;hed this Death, and purcha&s;ed for his People a title to &s;pi|ritual and eternal Life; which by his Grace and Spirit he conveys &amp; communicates <HI>in effectual Vocation</HI> to all, as many as the Father hath given him.</P>
<P>And &s;o a Number of tho&s;e who were dead in Adam, are thus again recover'd and made alive in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> then is plainly this, viz.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That as Adam brought in, and communicates Death to all his natural Seed: So the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath brought in, and communicates Life to all his &s;piritual Seed.</HI> Text, <HI>As in Adam all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive</HI>; i. e. all that ever are made alive.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate and clear up this Doctrinal Truth, by &s;peaking to the&s;e <HI>five</HI> things con|tained in it, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That both Adam and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were treated with, and acted as publick Per&s;ons, Heads, or Repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That both Adam and Je&s;us Chri&s;t had, and have a Seed, whom they &s;o repre&s;ented and acted for.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That as both Adams had, and have a Seed&punc; &s;o both their acts and influences are communicated to their Seed.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>That the one of the&s;e publick Heads con|veys Death with all the cur&s;ed influence of original Sin and Pollution: The other conveys Life with all the fruits of Grace, and ble&s;&s;ings of Salvation to his Seed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003871_0007_100266E543994F78">PROP. V. <HI>That each of the&s;e communications are made much in the &s;ame way and manner.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That both Adam and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were treated with, and acted as publick Per&s;ons, Heads, or Repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P>And in this re&s;pect Adam was indeed a Type of Chri&s;t, did repre&s;ent and re&s;emble him, and is &s;o &s;poken of in the Scripture on this account, Rom. 5 14.&mdash;<HI>Which was the figure of him that was to come.</HI> Adam was the Head of the fir&s;t Covenant; and &s;o was treated with, <HI>for</HI> and <HI>in&s;tead</HI> of all Mankind. He was the common Head and &s;urety of all Mankind, acted for them, and repre&s;ented them, as the Deputy of a Town, Colony, or any Corporation acts for, and repre&s;ents tho&s;e who choo&s;e and &s;end him.</P>
<P>God was plea&s;ed to call and appoint him to this Office, to treat with him in a Covenant way as &s;uch a common Head and publick Per&s;on; did &s;o plight a Covenant with him, wherein Adam became ingaged for, and charged with all his Children that &s;hould de|&s;cend from him; that he was to act for them, and they to &s;tand to what their Covenant Head did: If he &s;hould punctually obey, his Obedience was to be ours too, and we to receive the benefit, if he &s;hould di&s;obey, the act was to be ours too; we mu&s;t &s;tand and fall in our federal Head, we were in his Loins, he our Root in which we grew, and we acted in him, or with him, or by him. This is evidently implied in the Text, and further cleared up in other paragraphs of holy writ, particularly in Rom. 5.12, 17, 18. Here the Apo&s;tle plumply a&s;&s;erts that <HI>Sin came into the World</HI> by Adam, <HI>and Death by Sin; and that this Death hath pa&s;&s;ed</HI> or fallen <HI>on all Men, for that all have &s;inned,</HI> i. e. in Adam their publick Head. And in the 17 and 18 ver&s;es, he tells us to what &s;ad <HI>Effect</HI> this hath pa&s;&s;ed on all, <HI>even unto Condemnation</HI>: And that this Death hath a &s;overeign power over, or reigning influence in the Hearts of Men, that they die in Adam daily.</P>
<P><PB REF="003871_0008_100266E6C8D02A20">Thus the holy Scripture looks upon, or repre&s;ents all Men in their natural or unregenerate State, dead in Adam, and condemned with him in Law. But how could this be, were he not our publick Head, were he not &s;o looked upon &amp; treated with in the fir&s;t Covenant? Where would be the Ju&s;tice of &s;uch a conveyance of Sin, Guilt, and Death, to all his Po&s;terity? Be&s;ides 'tis evident he did &s;tand in the place of &s;uch a publick Per&s;on, and acted as &s;uch, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> the Scriptures &s;peak of him as &s;uch an one, placing him in oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t who is the &s;econd publick Head: So in the 47th ver. of our Context, <HI>The fir&s;t Man is of the Earth earthy, the &s;econd Man is the Lord from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And what! Tho' Mankind was not then capable to depute him to this Office by their own Choice, or Vote; yet infinite Wi&s;dom knew, who was the fitte&s;t Per&s;on to be deputed to this publick Tru&s;t, and therefore could make as wi&s;e a Choice for us, as we could have made for our &s;elves; and 'tis clear the fitte&s;t Per&s;on was in fact Cho&s;en; &s;o that we can't complain of any inju&s;tice done us on this account.</P>
<P>Well! As Adam, &s;o Je&s;us Chri&s;t is al&s;o a publick Head and Repre&s;entative: he is Head of the &s;econd, as Adam was of the fir&s;t Covenant. Chri&s;t is the Head of all the Elect; he was treated with as &s;uch, acted for them, &s;uffered for them, bea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Wrath of God in their room and &s;tead, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ied the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, their Sins were charged to him, layed upon him; and he bear the puni&s;hment of them, I&s;ai. 53.5, 6. <HI>And the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</HI></P>
<P>The Elect were in the eternal <HI>Decree,</HI> involved and wrap'd up with Chri&s;t in the fir&s;t Covenant, even from Eternity, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4 And as &s;oon as Man fell, Chri&s;t actually undertook for all the Elect, became &s;urety to his Father on their account, that &s;o by his own per|&s;onal acts, he might do away Sin and pre&s;ent his Elect to the Father guiltle&s;s and blamele&s;s in and by his own &s;ufferings and merits. And God was plea&s;ed to accept him as &s;uch a Surety, and to plight &s;uch a Co|venant
<PB N="6" REF="003871_0009_100266E849E49F90">
with him, and publickly declares his royal ac|ceptance and approbation of Chri&s;t in this Office, when he did actually appear in the World, to execute that for which he had &s;o undertaken, as in Mat. 3.17. <HI>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, &s;aying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>And it was by virtue of this early undertaking of Chri&s;t, as a publick Head, and his becoming &s;ecurity to the Father for all the Elect, that the Patriarchs and holy Men of old were &s;aved. For ina&s;much as he was become Surety, and was to obey and &s;uffer for them in time; the Law therefore looked on all that were in him thro' believing, as having really &s;uffered the penalty and yielded the obedience required, and &s;o as having fulfilled the Law of the fir&s;t Covenant; be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t was become <HI>Surety,</HI> had put in his <HI>Bond</HI> for us; become engaged to Ju&s;tice to do all for his Elect, <HI>when the fulne&s;s of time &s;hould come.</HI></P>
<P>And thus al&s;o when he did actually come in the Fle&s;h, and did in our Nature obey and &s;uffer, he did this as a publick Per&s;on for us, in our room and &s;tead: Hence that 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>For God hath made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI></P>
<P>And he now appears before the Father in Heaven as our publick Head, he is <HI>there</HI> our Advocate to plead our Cau&s;e, pre&s;ent our Services, and to procure for us all that good which we &s;tand in need of, and pray for. So the Apo&s;tle teacheth, 1 John 2.1. <HI>We have an Ad|vocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous.</HI></P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That Both Adam and Je&s;us Chri&s;t had, and have a Seed whom they &s;o repre&s;ented and acted for.</HI></P>
<P>All for whom they acted, and to whom they &s;tand in in the relation of a common or publick Head, are their Seed. Adam was not only the natural Parent, but al&s;o the federal Head of all Mankind; as they are de&s;cen|dants from him, and in their natural e&s;tate, they are
<PB N="7" REF="003871_0010_100207F30BD03350">
his Seed; his <HI>natural</HI> Seed, his <HI>Covenant</HI> Seed, branches of the &s;ame Stock &s;prang from the &s;ame Root; Before we had our being in the World, we were virtually in Adam's Loins, as the effect is in the Cau&s;e, or as fruit is fir&s;t in the Tree, before it is brought forth, or hath any actual Exi&s;tence.&mdash; Thus in this very &s;en&s;e as I take it, the Tribe of Levi, is &s;aid to pay tithes in Abraham, long before Levi the Father of that Tribe was born, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.9.</P>
<P>And when we actually have our being in the World, we are actually in Adam as our Covenant Head, are his Seed; and hence as one ob&s;erves, <HI>it is</HI> that all Na|tions are &s;aid to be of one Blood, Acts 17.26. <HI>And hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men.</HI>&mdash;We are in Covenant looked upon not only as the natural Seed of Adam, as we &s;pring from him in natural Generation; but al&s;o as his Covenant Seed and Children for whom he acted, and in whom we both &s;tand and fall.</P>
<P>Well! as Adam, &s;o the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath al&s;o a Seed: He al&s;o undertook as a Covenant Head, or publick Per&s;on to tran&s;act for Man, and to purcha&s;e to him&s;elf an <HI>holy</HI> Seed out of the ruined Rubi&s;h, and fallen race of old Adam; that thereby he might bring <HI>many Sons home to Glory at la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When God called him to this his Office, according to P&s;al. 40 7. <HI>Then &s;aid I, lo, I come, &amp;c.</HI> i. e. in an&s;wer to the call of the Father; then did the Father promi&s;e him &s;uch a Seed, to be the reward of his undertaking, I&s;ai. 53.10 <HI>When thou &s;halt make his Soul an offering for Sin, he &s;hall &s;ee his Seed,</HI> &amp;c. And again ver. 11. <HI>He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his Soul and be &s;atisfied, by his knowlege &s;hall thy righteous Servant ju&s;tify many.</HI></P>
<P>All the Elect were Chri&s;t's appointed Seed in the eternal Decree of Election, &s;o cho&s;en in him, according to Eph. 1.4, 5. <HI>According as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love: Having pre|de&s;tinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003871_0011_100266E9D9DDBFF8">And all the <HI>faithful</HI> upon their actual believing, become his real Seed. Faith takes them out of old Adam, Grace cuts them out of the old Stock and in|grafs them into the true Olive, the new Covenant, the &s;econd Adam, whereby they become his Seed, ac|cording to <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>But this brings me to the third thing, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That as both Adams have a Seed, &s;o both their acts and influence are communicated to their Seed.</HI></P>
<P>And this nece&s;&s;arily follows from the former: For if both were publick Per&s;ons or Repre&s;entatives, and both had and have a Seed for whom they, in their pub|lick capacity acted, and who were involved and wrapt up with them in the Covenant, Adam's Seed with him in the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t's Seed with him in the &s;econd <HI>Cove|nant</HI>; then both their acts and doings, mu&s;t needs be communicated to their Seed, &s;o far forth as they acted in this their publick capacity. Indeed their Seed did <HI>really act</HI> in them, or with them, or by them; as a Town acts with and by their Repre&s;entative, or a Colony by their Agent; who&s;e acts and influence &s;o far forth as he acts properly, in his publick capacity, mu&s;t needs be com|municative to all for whom, and in who&s;e name he &s;o acts</P>
<P>And as by the general Vote of mankind, &s;uch a depu|ting of one to repre&s;ent, and act for the whole body, in ca&s;es civil, is allowed to be ju&s;t; &s;o it is certainly no le&s;s ju&s;t in this ca&s;e. Nor can any one ju&s;tly complain of his being wronged, or layed under any di&s;advantage by his being &s;o in, or repre&s;ented by Adam: for it is certain they acted no otherways in him than they would have acted out of him; for the nature of every one being ju&s;t the &s;ame with his, they would have done ju&s;t as <HI>Adam</HI> did, if put upon the &s;ame trial as he was.&mdash; So that it was every whit as well; <HI>yea</HI> and on &s;ome accounts at lea&s;t, more &s;afe for his Children to act in, and by him, then it would have been for them to have acted &s;ingly for them&s;elves, &amp; each one to have made his own Choice.
<PB N="9" REF="003871_0012_100266ED56868E48">
For it is certain that the happine&s;s of his whole Po&s;te|rity (whom nature would make dear to him) being concerned in the Affair, as well as his own happine&s;s, could not but lay him under far greater moral engage|ments to take heed what he did, and &s;o make it &s;eem far more likely that he &s;hould per&s;evere and be faith|ful, than for any other Per&s;on in a &s;ingle capacity who would not be under the &s;ame engaging Circum|&s;tance. So that it &s;hould &s;eem this way fixed, or put Mankind really upon a fairer foot for happine&s;s, than if each &s;ingle Per&s;on had been to have acted for him|&s;elf and to have made his own Choice.</P>
<P>But then it is to be ob&s;erved, that altho' both Adams acted in &s;uch a publick capacity; yet there is a va&s;t odds, a wide difference in the acts and influences them|&s;elves, which the&s;e two publick Per&s;ons communicate to tho&s;e &s;tanding in &s;uch a Covenant relation with them.</P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>For the one conveys Death with all the cur&s;ed influence of original Sin and Pollution: The other conveys Life with all the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of Grace and ble&s;&s;ings of Salvation to his Seed.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Adam by his fir&s;t Sin, brought Guilt and Death on him&s;elf and all his Seed or Po&s;terity; the &s;econd Adam, Chri&s;t, by his obedience and &s;ufferings purcha&s;ed Life and Grace for his. This the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us of in the Text; 'tis there taken for granted, that <HI>in Adam all die</HI>; which is a &s;ad Truth, in a two|fold Sen&s;e, viz. his fir&s;t Sinful act which brought in the <HI>Fall</HI> was our act too, as acted by our publick Head, and &s;o by us in and thro' him,; as al&s;o that &s;inful pra|vity and corruption of Nature, which thereby he pro|cured to him&s;elf, he doth in the way of natural Gene|ration communicate to us; in both which re&s;pects, we all &s;inned in him, and are dead with him.</P>
<P>When Adam put forth his Hand, and took and eat of the forbidden Fruit, he did this, not as a <HI>private</HI> but as a <HI>publick</HI> Per&s;on, as we have before &s;hewn: Hence that his act was our act too, ju&s;tly imputed un|to
<PB N="10" REF="003871_0013_100207F4A7E6F740">
us, and charged on us, and put down to our Ac|count, becau&s;e the act of our Head and Repre&s;entative, and by virtue thereof conveyed unto us. Thus we all died in Adam, he &s;inning, we &s;inned in him, he being condemned for it, we are condemned in and with him; hence that, Rom. 5 18 <HI>By the offence of one, Judgment is come on all Men to condemnation</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Again, by this fir&s;t Sin or Fall, our Father and com|mon Head, Adam, not only lo&s;t the Life and Happi|ne&s;s promi&s;ed to perfect obedience, and incurr'd the Death threatned; but al&s;o he lo&s;t that noble rectitude of Nature, that divine principle of Grace, and &s;tock of Wi&s;dom, with which in his native &s;tate of innocence he was furni&s;hed and indued; the mo&s;t High taking of it from him, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for that fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, for his great abu&s;e thereof; on which followed ignorance, pravity, and perver&s;ne&s;s of Nature, corrupt and evil Principles, indi&s;po&s;ing the Mind for any good, and inclining of it to all manner of Evil.</P>
<P>Now this pravity and corruption of Nature which is &s;piritual Death; according to <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.6. Adam com|municates to all his Seed, and that in the way of natu|ral Generation. How and what this is, will more fully appear in the &s;equel. But allowing the <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> the thing it&s;elf will appear con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of Ju&s;tice. For we being guilty in the fir&s;t great Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion by and with our Covenant Head, and that as &s;oon as we have our being in him, by becoming of the &s;pecies of Man; therefore the &s;ame puni&s;hment be|came ju&s;tly due to us, as to him, for the &s;ame Sin, at lea&s;t the &s;ame for kind.</P>
<P>Now that puni&s;hment which immediately took place on him, for the fir&s;t Sin, was God's ca&s;ting of him out of his favour, and taking from him tho&s;e noble divine habits, or principles of &s;piritual Wi&s;dom and Grace, with which he was dignifyed and endowed in his fir&s;t Creation, called in holy writ the Image of God. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.27. And &s;o leaving of him to fall under the Govern|ment,
<PB N="11" REF="003871_0014_100266EFCF49D950">
or governing influence of a corrupt and depraved mind.</P>
<P>Well now! we being guilty in and with Adam of the &s;ame Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that as &s;oon as ever we become his Seed by having Soul and Body united together, it is but ju&s;t that we &s;hould for the &s;ame Sin be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame way Adam was, viz. by having that &s;tock of Divine Wi&s;dom, Knowlege, and Grace (or what ever men will plea&s;e to call it) withheld from and not be|&s;towed on us, in our Creation or Formation, which was due to our natures as fir&s;t made in innocency, and ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to capacitate and furni&s;h us for perform|ing or yielding that perfect Obedience, which the Law required of us. On which depravation or withholding from us, will nece&s;&s;arily follow that pravity and corrup|tion of Nature of which we are &s;peaking. For Man hereby being left without divine Light, and &s;o incapable to di&s;cern the &s;piritual &amp; real Excellencies of divine and heavenly things, being &s;unk below the chief good, and &s;o con&s;equently without inclination to it, hence the Soul can't chu&s;e and imbrace it; but being &s;till de&s;irous of good, and not rightly apprehending wherein it con&s;i&s;ts, and how it may be attained unto; hence he betakes him&s;elf unto the World for happine&s;s, and would fain attain thereunto by gratifying the de&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and carnal Mind, living in ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, apprehend|ing no greater happine&s;s than he fancies may be enjoyed in this way, &amp;c.&mdash;which certainly is Death in a &s;ound Scripture &s;en&s;e, Rom. 8.6. <HI>To be carnally minded is death.</HI></P>
<P>Now of this original <HI>depravation</HI> or <HI>pravity</HI> of humane nature, I think this further account may be given, viz. Man in his innocent &s;tate, was furni&s;h'd with powers <HI>na|tural,</HI> and <HI>&s;upernatural.</HI> By &s;upernatural powers, I mean &s;uch as capacitated him, clearly to di&s;cern the Will of God, and to entertain right notions about God, and &s;pi|ritual things, and my&s;teries, and perfectly to delight him|&s;elf in the &s;ame. Hereby he was made capable of com|munion with God, and of enjoying him as his chief good; perfectly to do his Duty, and to delight him&s;elf in it,
<PB N="12" REF="003871_0015_100207FA32227900">
and to live a life of communion with Heaven&mdash; <HI>this the Image of God in him.</HI></P>
<P>His natural powers, I call &s;uch as flowed from his na|tural Con&s;titution, and capacitated him for the enjoy|ment of this World, and for taking complacency there|in as a &s;ubordinate good. And <HI>the&s;e</HI> were under the go|vernment &amp; regulation of his divine &s;upernatural Powers. But when Man &s;inned, God (in way of ju&s;t puni&s;hment) took from him the&s;e &s;upernatural Powers, or divine na|ture, or habit, and left him wholly to his natural powers, which immediately a&s;&s;ume the Government, and lead away the Man <HI>captive,</HI> &amp;c. Now this as I take it, is <HI>the natural Man,</HI> &s;poken of in 1 Cor. 2 14. <HI>But the natural man receives not the things of the &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>And now, the Man being become thus depraved and carnal, wholly bent to carnal Plea&s;ures and enjoyments, conceiving his happine&s;s to con&s;i&s;t therein; <HI>hence</HI> he can't but have an inward aver&s;ion, to every thing that tends to thwart, cro&s;s and &s;top him in the pur&s;uit of that, wherein he hath conceived his felicity to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Now the Word of God, and his authority therein, do|ing this; <HI>hence</HI> he can't but dislike and hate it, at lea&s;t in his heart; as what he conceives would abridge him in his happine&s;s, by laying &s;uch re&s;traints on him, as he can't bear, and this inkindles enmity in him, again&s;t God and his holy Law: Which I take to be the <HI>Enmity</HI> &s;poken of, Rom. 8 7. <HI>Becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI></P>
<P>So that all Men <HI>dye in Adam,</HI> in this twofold &s;en&s;e, viz. We are condemned in and with him, for the fir&s;t &s;in: and he communicates this pravity and corrupti|on of nature, to all that de&s;cend from him, in the way of natural generation. And this &s;eems to be the truth, evident both from rea&s;on &amp; Scripture; For Adam could communicate no other nature to his Children, than he had him&s;elf: well, his nature being now depraved and viciated, &s;uch a nature therefore he mu&s;t needs commu|nicate. And the Scriptures &s;eem to give us this very account of the matter. Thus, after the Fall, Adam be|gets
<PB N="13" REF="003871_0016_100266F151315E00">
a Son in his own <HI>likene&s;s,</HI> Gen. 5.3&mdash; <HI>And begat a &s;on in his own likene&s;s, after his image.</HI>&mdash; And we are told what this is, John 3.6. <HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h</HI> And we are a&s;&s;ured, that Children born of corrupt &s;inful Parents, do derive from them no better a <HI>nature,</HI> Job 14.4 &amp; 15.14 <HI>What is Man that he &s;hould be clean? And he which is born of a woman that he &s;hould be righteous</HI>? And the Apo&s;tle confirms all this by tel|ling of us, what the &s;piritual condition of all per&s;ons <HI>is,</HI> while in their natural e&s;tate, wholly corrupt, wholly gone out of the way, &amp;c. Rom. 3.10, 11, 12. <HI>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one</HI> And ver. 13, 14, 16, 17.&mdash;<HI>De&s;truction &amp; mi&s;ery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known.</HI></P>
<P>Well now, Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam in like manner communicates a twofold life to all his &s;piritual <HI>Seed,</HI> viz. The life of Grace in Conver&s;ion, in this World, and a title to Eternal Life, in the other World.</P>
<P>As the fir&s;t Adam by the fir&s;t &s;in, brought all his Pro|geny under a &s;entence of Death; &s;o Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam by his bearing the &s;ins of all the Elect, in his own Body on the Cro&s;s, and being &s;o made a cur&s;e for them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3 13. Hath hereby removed the Sentence of the Law, from all that are his, and purcha&s;ed them a di&s;|charge from that Sentence; hence that, Rom 8.33, 34. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is Chri&s;t that died.</HI> And al&s;o Chri&s;t by him&s;elf yielding, in our Natures, that very Obedience to the moral Law, which in the fir&s;t Covenant, was made the condition of Eternal Life being be&s;tow'd; hath hereby given them a good and legal title unto life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Covenant threatned Death, on the lea&s;t failure in obedience, Gal. 3.10. <HI>It is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them</HI></P>
<P>Adam by the fir&s;t Sin, made him&s;elf and all his Po&s;te|rity, Men of Death, the Law immediately pronounceth
<PB N="14" REF="003871_0017_100266F3CBE2E090">
&s;entence on them, Ezek. 18.4&mdash;<HI>The Soul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die.</HI> Hence Ju&s;tice cannot be &s;atisfied, nor the &s;entence be rever&s;ed, unle&s;s the blood of the offender be &s;hed, the penalty truly &s;uffered, Heb. 9.22. <HI>And without &s;hedding of blood, is no remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Hence Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, undertakes for this, dies in our Na|ture, and &s;uffers the full demands of Ju&s;tice, as our Surety; which upon our believing, becomes ours, by the valid con&s;titution of God; and in the Law looked upon as our own act, and &s;uffering, as tho' &s;uffered by us; becau&s;e done by our Surety and Repre&s;entative; which therefore takes us out of old Adam, in whom we &s;inned; brings us from under the Law &s;entence, and into good terms with <HI>it.</HI> Hence that Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI>; compar'd with Rom. 3.19. and 6.14. <HI>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the reward of Life, was promis'd to <HI>perfect</HI> obedience, to the whole moral Law, as the Apo&s;tle plainly de&s;cribes, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10 5. But this Adam, and we in him, failed of, and &s;o forfeited the reward; and have lo&s;t all claim thereunto, as the Apo&s;tle teacheth us, Rom. 3 23. <HI>For all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI> But Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, hath al&s;o undertaken this for us, to renew our Claim, and in our Nature hath performed and yielded that very perfect obedience for us; hath fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s, as <HI>Matt</HI> 3 15. And that as a publick Per&s;on, as our great high Prie&s;t and Surety</P>
<P>Hereby hath he purcha&s;ed for all that believe on him, the &s;ame title, and legal claim, to Eternal Life, that Adam would have had, and we in him, had he per|&s;ever'd in perfect obedience. Thus the &s;econd Adam &s;aves from the Death brought in by the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; not by any Relaxation of the &s;everity of the fir&s;t Covenant, or Law, but by an exact and punctual fulfillment of the conditions of it, which &s;eems to be the plain mean|ing of the Apo&s;tle in that, Rom 3. ult. <HI>Do we then make void the Law thro' Faith? God forbid; yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI></P>

So Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, hath al&s;o a remedy for this evil di&s;ea&s;e, he re|covers from this &s;piritual Mi&s;ery and Death. He hath purcha&s;ed all Grace for his People, which by his holy Spirit, he conveys and communicates unto all, whom he effectually Calls to be <HI>his,</HI> to their recovery, and Renovation. He renews their &s;piritual powers, im|plants a principle of new Life, per&s;wades and enables them to return to God, and their duty; and makes them alive unto God, and holine&s;s. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.11. He revives again his own lo&s;t Image in them; &s;o making them new Creatures. 2 Cor. 5 17 <HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature: old things are pa&s;t away, be|hold all things are become new.</HI> He likewi&s;e communi|cates unto them, all that influencing, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, &amp; quick|ning Grace, whereby his &s;piritual Seed, &amp; Children, are enabled to overcome the World, vanqui&s;h Temptation, mortify their Lu&s;ts, and to per&s;evere in an holy Life; to the final Salvation of their Souls. Hence that Joh. 1.16. <HI>Of his fulne&s;s have we all received, and grace for grace.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have &s;hewn what both Adams <HI>convey,</HI> &amp; com|municate to their Seed.</P>
<P>Which brings me to the fifth and la&s;t thing, viz</P>
<P>PROP. V. <HI>That each of the&s;e convey; or each of the&s;e communications are made much in the &s;ame way and manner.</HI></P>
<P>So the text intimates to us; As in Adam &mdash; So in Chri&s;t &mdash;</P>
<P>Three things con&s;ider'd will clear up this,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Each of the&s;e communications are made in a Cove|nant way</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e are in pur&s;uance of the Covenant made with each publick head. The fir&s;t Adam being Head

of the fir&s;t or old Covenant, doth therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; com|municate the guilt &amp; cur&s;es of that broken Covena<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> unto all wrap'd up with him therein; becau&s;e &s;uch was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> tenour of that Covenant; that his acts and doings as &s;uch a publick Per&s;on, &s;hould be equally their act, for whom he &s;o acted: and that his influence &s;hould derive to them as above &s;hewn.</P>
<P>So in like manner, that Chri&s;t's Suffering, and Obedi|ence, is made ours in Law, and imputed; and the influ|ences of his Grace conveyed, is in pur&s;uance of the &s;econd or new Covenant. Hence</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As Adam conveys &s;in and guilt to tho&s;e that had not &s;inned actually; So doth Je&s;us Chri&s;t convey righteou&s;ne&s;s to tho&s;e&punc; that had not wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Adam act|ing for us in the Covenant, and we in him; hence upon his fir&s;t &s;inful act, we were all virtually made &s;inners; and &s;o the &s;entence went out again&s;t us; and we were hereby involved in the Cur&s;e, were looked upon as &s;in|ners, &amp; expo&s;ed to the condemning &s;entence of the Law; and this before we made our &s;elves &s;o, by any per&s;onal, &s;inful act of our own. Hence that Rom. 5 14. <HI>Death reigned from Adam to Mo&s;es, even over them that had not &s;inned after the &s;imilitude of Adams tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now to &s;in actually, is to &s;in after the &s;imilitude of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but before we &s;in &s;o, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Death reigns over us. The Apo&s;tle in this, as one ob|&s;erves, doubtle&s;s points at Babes, who die in Infancy, before ever they had committed an actual &s;in; yet Death reigns over them, they are guilty in their federal head.</P>
<P>So Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s in like manner, is conveyed to tho&s;e that had not wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s. Yea all the Elect are cho&s;en, and in the Decree or Covenant of Re|demption looked upon as Righteous, having a Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s engaged for, &s;ecured and laid up for them in the Covenant, long before there is any real conveyance thereof made to them, yea long before they have their being or exi&s;tence in the World; as &s;eems evident from the Eph. 1 4, 5. <HI>According as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we &s;hould be holy,
<PB N="17" REF="003871_0020_100207FF042E9268">
and without blame before him in love: Having prede&s;tinated us unto the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will</HI> compare Rom. 9 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0, 31 <HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay then?

<P N="3">3. <HI>Finally,</HI> It is in the &s;ame way and manner, even thro' our union to either of the&s;e publick Heads, that either of the&s;e communications are actually made, and conveyed to us. No &s;ooner do we become of the &s;pe|cies of Mankind, by having Soul and Body united, but hereby we become united unto Adam, of his Seed and Children; by virtue of which union to him, his Sin is imputed and his Guilt conveyed unto us per&s;onally, together with that whole depravation, pravity, or cor|ruption of Nature which Adam procured, and brought in by his fir&s;t Sin or Fall. What le&s;s than this is con|tained in that ingenious and plump confe&s;&s;ion of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was &s;hapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI></P>
<P>And this corrupt and &s;inful Nature thus derived, di&s;|covers its &s;elf in Children as &s;oon as they can act, which is indeed an inconte&s;table proof of the truth here in hand: Hence that P&s;al. 58.3. <HI>The wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb, they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they be born &s;peaking lies.</HI></P>
<P>Well now in like manner; as &s;oon as a Soul is united to Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, through Faith in his Name, what he hath done becomes that Souls, his merits are applied and his righteou&s;ne&s;s is conveyed, and made over to it, and is in Covenant, and Law looked upon as his own: and that Per&s;on &s;tands righteous and clear before God in the virtue of the &s;ame; hence &s;uch Texts, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.22 <HI>Eph.</HI> 2 61.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003871_0021_100266FA41B8C008">Thro' this union al&s;o is conveyed all needed influ|ences of Grace.

<P>Thus we have endeavour'd to &s;hew what is contained, and wrapt up in the&s;e few Words. <HI>As in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI></P>
<P>Some <HI>Application</HI> or <HI>Improvement</HI> now follows</P>
<P>USE I. Of <HI>Information</HI> in a few things, As</P>
<P N="1">1. Learn we from what was offer'd under the Doctrine, <HI>That Adam and Je&s;us Chri&s;t divide the World.</HI> They are both covenant Heads, and the alone publick Heads, to whom all Per&s;ons in the World &s;tand related in Covenant. All in their natural E&s;tate are the Children and covenant Seed of Adam, have their in-being in him, and &s;o are under the Cur&s;e he brought in; and al&s;o under the Government and influence of a depraved vitiated Nature derived from him, and mu&s;t &s;o remain until by Faith in Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, they get out out of this cur&s;ed Stock by being ingraffed into the new and living one. This is a &s;ad &s;tate and condition, not only of all Heathens, Pagans, Infidels, &amp;c. but al&s;o of all unbelieving, prophane, hypocritical, chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ors: They are &s;till the Children of old Adam and fallen with him, involved, <HI>deeply involved</HI> with him in <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> expo&s;ed to peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>But now all believers, all faithful Chri&s;tians, they belong to the other publick Head, even Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam; they are no longer related to the fir&s;t Adam, no more under the dominion of the Law of the fir&s;t Covenant, Chri&s;t hath fulfilled that Law for them, born the penalty, yielded the obedience therein required, and &s;o hath di&s;charged them from the demands and
<PB N="19" REF="003871_0022_100266FBCEFEF188">
penalties of it, &s;toped its mouth, <HI>that it hath nothing to lay to the Charge of the&s;e Elect of God.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;hews us the wide difference there is between us, who make profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Faith, embrace the &s;ame way of Wor&s;hip, dwell together and Wor&s;hip together, in the &s;ame Family, &s;ame Congregation, and &s;ame vi&s;ible Church, there are &s;ome who are the Chil|dren of the fir&s;t Adam, involved in the Cur&s;e, laden with Guilt, receive of his cur&s;ed influence, and are really heirs of Hell and wrath. Others belong to Chri&s;t, are his happy Seed and ble&s;&s;ed Children, heirs of the Covenant of Grace and thro' him of Glory; who re|ceive of his ble&s;&s;ed influence; <HI>of his fulne&s;s and grace for grace.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! the difference between the Children of Chri&s;t, and the Children of fallen Adam, tho' we di&s;cern it not with a carnal Eye.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence learn al&s;o, from what hath been in&s;i&s;ted on; <HI>That there is no mid-way between a &s;tate of Nature, and a &s;tate of Grace: Or between an e&s;tate of real Ju&s;tifica|tion, and real Condemnation.</HI> There is no medium, no mid-way between the&s;e two. Every Per&s;on in the World, is in an e&s;tate either of compleat Ju&s;tification, or of real Condemnation; there is no being, or &s;tanding in mid-way between the&s;e two. Conver&s;ion is in&s;tantaneous; the Man pa&s;&s;eth immediately out of the one condition, into the other. There are degrees of Sanctification, but none of Ju&s;tification. No Man is partly in an e&s;tate of Ju&s;tification, &amp; partly in an e&s;tate of Condemnation; nor is one Saint more fully ju&s;tified than another. He that hath any title to Heaven, hath all the title that can be; <HI>Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s is equally unto and upon all who believe, without any the lea&s;t difference</HI>; and he that hath not this full title, hath none at all. He that an't fully in Chri&s;t, is fully in Adam, &amp;c. Alas there are many who can't conclude them&s;elves Converts, have no good evidence or warrant &s;o to do; yea who dare not really pretend to do it: Who yet labour to bear them&s;elves up, upon a hope, that their hone&s;t mean|ings, moral lives, duties, alms-giving, &amp;c. will &s;o make

even for their Sins, and be of that worth in the &s;ight of God, as to procure for them acceptance: They fancy they live as well as mo&s;t Chri&s;tians do, they don't wrong their Neighbours in their dealings, they are no Fornicators, no Idolators, they defraud nor, they go the rounds in Duties, make many Prayers; and they think &s;urely there is real worth in all this; and why an't they as likely to find acceptance as any; they can't think that a God of mercy, will &s;end &s;uch as they are to Hell, tho' they do fall &s;hort of a thorough Conver&s;ion, tho' they an't really in Chri&s;t thro' a divine Faith.</P>
<P>But Sirs, if what we have heard on this Subject be true, your hopes, &s;uch hopes, are utterly vain and groundle&s;s; for it is certain you belong to the one, or the other of the&s;e publick Heads; if you are not in Chri&s;t by a thorough work of the Spirit, by a true and &s;ound Conver&s;ion, you are yet in old Adam; and if in him, you are certainly under the Cur&s;e, and can have no acceptance with God: And you &s;hould hearken to what the Scripture &s;aith Joh. 3.18&mdash; <HI>But he that be|lieveth not is condemned already.</HI> &amp; ver. 36. <HI>He that believ|eth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life: and he that be|lieveth not on the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> And that is an awful Text, Rev. 21.8. <HI>The fearful, and unbelieving, &amp;c. &s;hall have their part in the Lake that burns with Fire &amp; Brim&s;tone.</HI></P>

Be&s;ides they have derived &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> impotency &amp; corrup|tion of Nature from old Adam, thro' the mediation of their next immediate Parents, as renders them uncapable of that which is good&punc; &amp; eagerly bent to all that is evil&punc; hence they every day come &s;hort of the glory of God, and run them&s;elves further on the &s;core with him, many ways aggravating all the Guilt that before lay on them, and are daily giving fre&s;h wounds to their poor Souls, trea|&s;uring up to them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath. &mdash; How &s;ad a condition then, are all unconverted Per|&s;ons, all the <HI>natural</HI> Seed of Adam <HI>in</HI>; tho' in&s;en&s;ible &s;ecure and hardened in it. And tho' there is a mo&s;t glo|rious way of e&s;cape provided, yet how indi&s;po&s;ed, and aver&s;e are they to a compliance therewith, they are full of enmity again&s;t it, at lea&s;t in their Hearts, Rom. 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is enmity.</HI>&mdash;And no wonder! &s;ince they are &s;o full of &s;piritual blindne&s;s, as not to be able to &s;ee, either their own Mi&s;ery, or Chri&s;t's Excellency.</P>
<P>Hence being de&s;titute of Divine, and Spiritual Light, and incapable to di&s;cern the Excellencies of God and Chri&s;t &amp; Holine&s;s,'tis no wonder that they cannot love God and Holine&s;s, and hate Sin; without which the will never can convert, nor the Man have any true de|&s;ires to be brought out of his pre&s;ent &s;inful condition.</P>
<P>Indeed in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of blindne&s;s, they may have &s;ome notions, and rational Convictions, that their pre&s;ent condition an't &s;afe; and &s;o may be endeavour|ing to recover them&s;elves by their own doings; &amp; hence many times take pains, and go a great way in moral Vertues and Duties, yet &s;till they have no inward cordial love for Religion and Holine&s;s, 'tis always a burden, and meer vexation to them, and they won't be per&s;waded, to ca&s;t off their own vain confidences, and to &s;ee that all they can do won't help, nor avail them, until they do indeed lay a&s;ide their own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and look out after Faith in Chri&s;t, and an intere&s;t in him, who only can help and &s;ave them, out of their &s;piritual Mi&s;ery.</P>

<P N="4">4. Our Doctrine al&s;o teacheth us, &s;omething <HI>of the happy e&s;tate of Chri&s;t's &s;piritual</HI> Seed. The Text tells us, that <HI>in Chri&s;t they are all made alive:</HI> Tho' they were once dead in Adam, yet now in Chri&s;t they are made a|live, &amp; live evermore. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t delivers all <HI>his</HI> from the death &amp; mi&s;ery brought in by Adam, and gives them the &s;ame, or a better title to life, than Adam would have had, if he had perfectly kept the Law, and performed the obedience therein required.</P>
<P>From &s;piritual Death, or the reigning Power of Sin, he delivers them, by &s;ending his holy Spirit into their Hearts, to dethrone Sin there; &mdash; &s;often the Heart, en|lighten the Mind, per&s;wade the Will, put a new Bias on the Affections, &amp;c. whereby the Temper, Di&s;po&s;ition, and Inclination, of the Mind is alter'd, from &s;inful to ho|ly: Sin and Lu&s;t lo&s;eth the Dominion, and Grace takes the Throne of the Heart, &s;its and rules there; that al|tho' Corruption ri&s;e, and &s;tir around the Heart, and give Trouble, yet it cannot get the Dominion, Grace keeps it down and &s;ubdues it again Hence that, Rom 6.14. <HI>For Sin &s;hall not have Dominion over you</HI> &mdash; compare with P&s;al. 37 24 <HI>Tho' he fall, he &s;hall nor be utterly ca&s;t down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand</HI> From the cur&s;e and condemnation of the Law, hath he redeem|ed them by being made a cur&s;e for them, and &s;o bearing the penalty in their room and &s;tead, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. A title unto life hath he purcha&s;ed for them, by yielding in our natures as our publick head, that very obedience to the Law of the fir&s;t Covenant, which was required of Man in innocency, as the condition of Lifes being continued, and perfect happine&s;s being be&s;towed, which condition Chri&s;t having fulfilled, mu&s;t needs now give the &s;ame title and claim to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And as obedience to the new Covenant, is required in order to our partaking in the &s;aving benefits thereof, &s;o Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed, and by his good Spirit conveys all

<P>USE II. Of <HI>Examination.</HI></P>
<P>If it be as we have heard, then &s;urely it concerns us all to <HI>Examine</HI> our &s;elves, that we may know to which of the&s;e Covenant Heads we belong, in which Adam we are; It is certain we every one of us belong to the <HI>one</HI> or to the <HI>other,</HI> and according as we &s;tand related, &s;o is our e&s;tate good or bad, &s;afe or dangerous: Then let us be advi&s;ed to examine into this matter, and try our &s;elves, that &s;o we may know how it is like to fare with is; 'tis a matter of the la&s;t moment, therefore take heed of carele&s;ne&s;s herein; don't be flighty, don't deceive your&s;elves; remember 'tis the precious Soul that lieth at &s;take, that is to be &s;av'd or lo&s;t, and your end will be as your &s;piritual relation is at la&s;t found to be, either to the fir&s;t, or to the &s;econd Adam. In the one <HI>all die,</HI> in the other <HI>all are made alive.</HI> And for your help here, I will lay down two or three rules of tryal;</P>
<P N="1">1. What Birth have you? Only the natural! are you only Born, or are you al&s;o New-born? For they who de&s;cend from Adam&punc; in the way of natural Generation, are his Seed, and belong to him, as you heard under the Doctrine. But, they that are Born again of &s;piritual re|generation, are the Seed of the &s;econd Adam. Well! what evidences can you produce of your New birth, of your being Born of the Spirit, of your Regeneration? Chri&s;t's Seed are a New born Seed, Joh. 1.13 <HI>Which were born, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> Do you know what this New birth means? Many are ignorant of it, <HI>Nicolemus</HI> tho' a Teacher in I&s;rael was &s;o, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. But do you know by experience, what it is? Have you felt the pangs of it, in deep convictions of your &s;in and mi&s;ery? Have you had a &s;oul humbling, and heart affecting &s;ight of your
<PB REF="003871_0027_10026704041E2748">
peri&s;hing condition in old Adam Not only a &s;ight of federal Guilt &amp; per&s;onal acts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;in, but al&s;o that &s;ad and fearful pravity and pollution of nature, which Adam con|veys to all his Seed, which wholly unfits for all &s;pi|ritual &s;ervice, and pollu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s all the Duties we do perform while in &s;uch a condition, keeping the heart full of En|mity, &amp;c. And have you therefore been brought really to &s;ee, that your help was not in your own Powers? And hath this put you upon an humble, fervent, &amp; dili|gent looking and &s;eeking unto Chri&s;t, to &s;end his holy Spirit to enlighten, help and &s;ave you? In a word, hath the Law &s;lain you, and the Go&s;pel heal'd you? have you been indeed dead in Adam, but reviv'd and made alive in Chri&s;t? How do you live, is it in newne&s;s of life, as becomes &s;uch a New-born &s;tate?</P>
<P N="2">2. Which Covenant doth your Souls cleave unto, and act under the influence of, that of Works or of Grace?</P>
<P>Adam is head of the Covenant of Works, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t of the Covenant of Grace. Well then, would you know to which you belong, in which <HI>Adam</HI> you have your in-being; Examine to which Covenant doth your Souls cleave, to that of Works or of Grace? And would you know this; then reflect and ask your &s;elves, on what &s;core do you perform Duties, is it to ingratiate your &s;elves into God's favour by your own doings, me|rits, &amp; duties? why this is to cleave to the old Cove|nant of Works. So on what account do you look for, and expect acceptance in Duties &amp; Obedience, is it on account of any worth in them, or in you? why this is an old Covenant Spirit. So do you go forth in your own &s;trength unto Duty? this is to cleave to the old Cove|nant, and will argue you belong to old Adam.</P>
<P>But now to go out of &s;elf, to have no confidence in the fle&s;h, to depend on the meer Grace of God in Chri&s;t, to look unto and be as dependant on the holy Spirit for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, di&s;po&s;ition, and ability, to perform duties, as on Chri&s;t the Son to merit acceptance for you&punc; to be thus dependent on meer free Grace for every thing; for a&s;&s;i&s;|tance in all your Obedience, and on Chri&s;t's merits and interce&s;&s;ions alone, for your whole acceptance therein: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is a <HI>new</HI> Covenant Spirit.</P>
