<Q><BIBL><HI>TITUS II. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash; Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Epi&s;tle, out of which I have taken the Text, was &s;ent by <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus.</HI> It would take up too much of the Time allow'd me, to enter upon the Character of this eminent Servant of GOD; e&s;pecially in his Capacity as an Of|ficer in the Church of CHRIST, under which Con&s;ide|ration, and not as a private Chri&s;tian, he is here wrote to.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay, he was one of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Converts, a Fellow-Labourer with him in the Kingdom and Pati|ence of JESUS CHRIST, and his Companion in Travels. It was with <HI>Paul</HI> that he went to <HI>Crete</HI>; and by him he was left there to &s;erve the Ends of the Go&s;pel. Some &s;ay, he was now con&s;tituted <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Crete</HI>; but 'tis remarkable, he is not &s;poken of as the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of this Place, by any of the Fathers within the three fir&s;t Centuries: Nor does the Scripture at all favour &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="005357_0005_101728E237873D90">
a Notion. It rather repre&s;ents him as tarrying here on &s;ome <HI>temporary</HI> Occa&s;ion, than as a <HI>fixt Officer.</HI></P>
<P>The Story is thus,</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> upon their coming to <HI>Crete,</HI> found Things in a very un&s;ettled State. For though con&s;i|derable Numbers had embraced Chri&s;tianity, they had too much neglected <HI>Order.</HI> They had few or no <HI>or|dained</HI> Elders among them; and, perhaps, were not as yet formed into di&s;tinct Churches: Or, if this was the Ca&s;e, they had not got into a <HI>regular State,</HI> without which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible Societies &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t long with|out falling into Confu&s;ion. Now, <HI>for this Cau&s;e</HI> it was, that <HI>Titus was left in Crete, that he might &s;et in Order the Things that were wanting, and ordain Elders in eve|ry City:</HI> Which, when he had done, the more &s;pecial End of his Continuance in this Place was an&s;wered, and he might travel el&s;ewhere, as in all Probability he did.</P>
<P>But however this be, his being at <HI>Crete,</HI> in the Ser|vice of CHRIST, and under peculiar Circum&s;tances of Difficulty, was the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Paul</HI>'s writing this E|pi&s;tle to him; in which, many are the Advices he gives him for the Direction of his Conduct, as one in|tru&s;ted with the Management of the Affairs of CHRIST's Kingdom.</P>
<P>He is very particular in minding him of the <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary Qualifications</HI> for the &s;acred Office, that he might put none into it, who were not fit for &s;o important a Tru&s;t. And he the rather cho&s;e to enlarge upon this Head, as <HI>many unruly and Vain-talkers and Deceivers</HI> were &s;cattered up and down, <HI>&s;ubverting whole Hou&s;es, and teaching Things they ought not for filthy Lucre's Sake.</HI> It may &s;eem &s;trange, that, in the Days of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> there &s;hould be &s;uch Numbers of <HI>fal&s;e Teachers</HI>: But &s;o it was in Fact; yea, and they were grown to &s;uch
<PB N="7" REF="005357_0006_101729368F552FA8">
an Height in <HI>Impudence,</HI> even in tho&s;e primitive Times, that they could exalt them&s;elves above the very <HI>Apo&s;|tles.</HI> And in Order to this, they were &s;o far Ma&s;ters in the Art of Deceit, as to <HI>transform them&s;elves into Angels of Light:</HI> Nor did they &s;tick at any Thing, &s;o they could but le&s;&s;en the <HI>Apo&s;tolic</HI> Reputation, and wind them&s;elves into the Affections of the Populace. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;eems very &s;ollicitous, that the Church might be rid of the&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>dangerous Teachers</HI>; and, as the be&s;t Expedient to this End, directs, that none might have committed to them the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, but <HI>well qualified</HI> Per&s;ons; one e&s;&s;en|tial Requi&s;ite in who&s;e Character he has declared mu&s;t be that, <HI>able, by &s;ound Doctrine, both to exhort and con|vince the Gain&s;ayers.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which it is natural to remark, if none are al|low'd to be intru&s;ted with the Mini&s;try but tho&s;e who have <HI>Ability to convince Gain-&s;ayers,</HI> it mu&s;t certainly be the Duty of &s;uch, when they are in the Mini&s;try, to make U&s;e of this <HI>Ability</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e, who <HI>teach Things which they ought not.</HI> How el&s;e will they an&s;wer one of the expre&s;s Ends of their being put into the &s;acred Office? And to what Purpo&s;e is it, that this <HI>Ability</HI> mu&s;t be found in them, if 'tis not their Duty to make U&s;e of it, as the Occa&s;ion of the Church &s;hall render it needful?</P>
<P>But among all the Directions given to <HI>Titus,</HI> for his Conduct as a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> there is no one of more Weight than that in the Text, <HI>Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</HI> And 'tis of common Obligation on all, whom it has plea&s;ed God to put into the Mini&s;try. They &s;hould all behave &s;o as not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;o as to give no <HI>ju&s;t Occa&s;ion</HI> to be &s;o. That's the Meaning of the Words. O|therwi&s;e, Mini&s;ters would have a hard Ta&s;k indeed. Their Duty would be an utter Impo&s;&s;ibility. For 'tis not in their Power, though they &s;hould be <HI>as wi&s;e as
<PB N="8" REF="005357_0007_101728E418C40AC8">
Serpents, and harmle&s;s as Doves,</HI> to pa&s;s through the World, and not be de&s;pi&s;ed, They may, through the Supply of the SPIRIT of JESUS CHRIST, behave &s;o circum&s;pectly and inoffen&s;ively, as that none may have Rea&s;on to treat them with Contempt; but they can't command the Wills of other Men, they have not the Government of their Pa&s;&s;ions, or Prejudices, or Lu&s;ts. The GREAT SAVIOUR him&s;elf, though a Prophet of un&s;potted Innocence, was yet <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed of Men.</HI> And <HI>&s;hall the Di&s;ciple be above his</HI> LORD? Shall the World vilify the MASTER, and the <HI>Servant</HI> be better treated? The Spirit of too many is &s;uch, that we may expect, be we as cautious as we will, to be derided. And this indeed &s;eems to be implied in the Text it &s;elf. The Exhortation, <HI>Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thee,</HI> plainly &s;uppo&s;es a too great Pronene&s;s in People to treat Mini&s;ters with Contempt; and their Duty lies, not in People's not de&s;pi&s;ing them, but in not de&s;erving their Contempt, in doing nothing that may lay a ju&s;t Foundation for it.</P>
<P>In further &s;peaking to the Text, I &s;hall,</P>
<P N="1">I. Say &s;omething of that <HI>Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> there is in <HI>Peo|ple</HI> to de&s;pi&s;e the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST.</P>
<P N="2">II. Show wherein they &s;hould take Care to avoid the <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> of Contempt.</P>
<P N="3">III. Repre&s;ent the <HI>Obligations</HI> which lie upon them to &s;uch a Care.</P>
<P>The whole will then be followed with &s;ome &s;utable <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. I am, in the fir&s;t Place, to &s;peak of that <HI>Di&s;po&s;i|tion</HI> there is in <HI>People</HI> to de&s;pi&s;e the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST. Not that I would in&s;inuate, as if they were generally faulty in this Re&s;pect. Many there are, GOD be thank|ed, who acknowledge the &s;pecial Relation they bear to JESUS CHRIST, and treat them as <HI>Stewards of the My&s;teries of GOD; e&s;teeming them highly in Love,</HI> both
<PB N="9" REF="005357_0008_101729382DFE98E0">
for their <HI>Office,</HI> and <HI>Work's Sake.</HI> And &s;ome, it may be, think more highly of them than is meet. Tho&s;e, to be &s;ure, do &s;o, who have their <HI>Per&s;ons in Admiration</HI>; blindly receiving all they &s;ay, as though it were infalli|ble Truth. This is doing them too much Honour; yea, 'tis placing them in the Room of CHRIST, and calling them <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>one Ma&s;ter in Heaven. Brethren,</HI> we renounce all claim to &s;uch un|due Reverence. We don't pretend to <HI>have Dominion over your Faith,</HI> but only to be <HI>Helpers of your Joy.</HI> And in&s;tead of an implicit Faith in our Dictates, we commend to you the Example of the noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> who <HI>&s;earched the Scriptures daily,</HI> to &s;ee whether the Things taught them were the Truths of GOD, yea, or nay: Nor dare we advi&s;e you to <HI>hold fa&s;t</HI> what we de|liver to you, in the Cour&s;e of our Preaching, only as you perceive it to be <HI>good,</HI> upon full <HI>Proof</HI> from the Word of CHRIST. <HI>To the Law, and to the Te&s;timony:</HI> If what we &s;ay does not agree herewith, there is no Light nor Truth in it.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, have conceiv'd &s;o high an Opi|nion of the uncommon Sanctity of &s;ome particular Mi|ni&s;ters, in Di&s;tinction from others, and the divine Tea|chings they are under, as to &s;uppo&s;e them to have got beyond all Danger of Mi&s;takes; you may be ready to think it impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould err, while you follow the In&s;tructions of Men filled with &s;uch extraordinary Mea&s;ures of the HOLY GHOST: But you ought to remember, 'tis not always tho&s;e who make the greate&s;t Pretences to the SPIRIT, who are mo&s;t favoured with his <HI>real</HI> Influences; nor are any &s;ince the Days of In|&s;piration, &s;o led by the SPIRIT as to be infallible. A|las! the be&s;t qualified Mini&s;ters are but Men; Men of <HI>like Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> with your &s;elves: And of this they too often give Proof by the Errors they run into, in Prin|ciple as well as Practice. They may not therefore be depended on, as though you could not be mi&s;guided by
<PB N="10" REF="005357_0009_101728EEF100F7B8">
them. Be their Gifts, or Graces, or Zeal, what they will; or let their Pretences to the <HI>immediate</HI> Conduct of the Divine SPIRIT be as peremptory as they will, you mu&s;t not believe this, or the other Thing, to be the Truth, as it is in JESUS, upon their Authority: No, but you mu&s;t bring what they &s;ay, with an unprejudic|ed Mind, to the HOLY BIBLE; clo&s;ing in with it, or rejecting it, as you find it, upon Trial, to agree or di&s;a|gree with that <HI>one only Te&s;t</HI> of all religious Truth: Nor will you otherwi&s;e be able to excu&s;e your &s;elves ano|ther Day. It won't then &s;uffice to plead, that you were told this, or that, by tho&s;e you e&s;teemed Men <HI>ex|traordinarily</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the SPIRIT; for you had the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to repair to, and might have examined what they &s;aid by that &s;acred and unerring Rule: Which, if you neglected to do, believing <HI>Man</HI> rather than GOD, how will you hold up your Heads? 'Twon't le&s;&s;en, but aggravate your Fault, to pretend you &s;ubmitted your Con&s;ciences to meer humane Dictates; for it will then appear, that your embracing any Thing for a Truth of GOD, upon any Authority &s;hort of his, was &s;etting up that Authority in his Throne, and paying that Honour to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator.</P>
<P>But if there are &s;ome, who ri&s;e too high in their Re|&s;pects to Mini&s;ters, are there not others, on the con|trary Extreme, who fall as much too low? And is not this the Spirit evidently prevailing at this Day? Are there not many who vilify the Office it &s;elf, treat|ing it with Sneer and Ridicule? And what Wonder, if the Per&s;ons of Mini&s;ters don't e&s;cape the Scorn and Contempt of &s;uch? They have indeed a pitiful Tho't of all of this Profe&s;&s;ion; and &s;pare none, though of the mo&s;t &s;hining Accompli&s;hments. If they know no|thing more of a Man than that he is a Mini&s;ter, 'tis enough with them to fini&s;h his Character: This alone will give them a low mean Opinion of him; though without either Candour or Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005357_0010_1017293CAF107A28">Not but that there have been, among the <HI>Clergy,</HI> both <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>vicious</HI> Men. It would be a &s;trange Thing indeed if their hadn't. But why mu&s;t the whole Order &s;uffer Reproach on this Account? Is this fair? Is it thought to be &s;o in other Profe&s;&s;ions? If there are any who make them&s;elves vile, let them bear all the Indignity they de&s;erve: But where is the Equity of blaming the Innocent with the Guilty? Are there not Men of Worth in the &s;acred Function, as well as in other Em|ployments? Men of Capacity and Integrity, yea, and of exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s, through their abundant La|bours in the Cau&s;e of GOD? And &s;hall they all, not|with&s;tanding, be condemned, and by the Lump too, as a Parcel of &s;imple, or el&s;e crafty and de&s;igning Men?</P>
<P>This, I know, has &s;ometimes been &s;ugge&s;ted, if not plainly &s;poken out, to the Prejudice of their Reputati|on; and with all the Embelli&s;hments of Wit and Railery. But if Men, profe&s;&s;edly of no Principles, are Enemies to tho&s;e, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to plead the Cau&s;e of Virtue and true Religion, what is it more than might be expected? Nor would they act up to their Character, if, rather than not a&s;per&s;e them, they did not make a handle of any Thing; and in&s;tead of &s;olid Argument exert them&s;elves in prophane Banter.</P>
<P>I may not impertinently add here, 'Tis not only a|mong athei&s;tical vicious Men that Mini&s;ters are treated with Contempt. They have appear'd &s;trangely prone to de&s;pi&s;e one another, and to take all Occa&s;ions to do &s;o; and this has been too much their Way, in all Places, and Ages of the World. If &s;ome Mini&s;ters han't had Light to think, or &s;peak, ju&s;t as &s;ome others would have them, how commonly have they been the Objects of their Contempt? What Names of Igno|miny and Reproach have been ca&s;t upon them? And how has the Spirit of Contempt been propagated from Mini&s;ters to People, to the great Hindrance of the
<PB N="12" REF="005357_0011_101728F090524C88">
Go&s;pel? Perhaps, &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and it may be as faithful Mini&s;ters as any in the Go&s;pel-Church, have &s;uffered more from their own Brethren, and &s;uch among the People as have been &s;et on Fire by them, than they ever have, even from foul-mouth'd Infidels. Says the excellent Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> &s;peaking of the Sectaries of his Day, <Q>They have quite out-&s;trip|ped the <HI>profane Scorners</HI> of the Mini&s;try.&mdash;By ma|ny Years Experience in conver&s;ing with the&s;e Men, I can &s;peak it knowingly, that the chiefe&s;t of their Zeal is let out again&s;t the faithful Mini&s;ters of CHRIST. He is the able&s;t of their Preachers, that can rail at them in the vile&s;t Language. It is their mo&s;t common Di&s;cour&s;e, in all Companies, both god|ly and profane, to vilify the Mini&s;try, and make them odious to all; partly, by Slanders, and partly by Scorns. Is this the Way to win Souls? Where|as formerly they thought, that if a Man were won to a Love of the Mini&s;try, and Ordinan|ces, he was in a hopeful Way of being won to God; now the&s;e Men are diligent to bring all Men to &s;corn them, as if this were all that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;aving of their Souls, and he only &s;hall be happy, that can deride at Mini&s;ters and Di&s;ci|pline. He adds, If any Man doubt of the Truth of what I &s;ay, he is a Stranger in <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I will not go about to draw a Parallel between the late Times in this Land, and tho&s;e referred to by this pious and learned Writer; but thus much I may be allow'd to &s;ay, that the <HI>Body of the Mini&s;ters</HI> were ne|ver treated with more In&s;ult and Contempt than by Multitudes, and of tho&s;e too, who once e&s;teemed them the Glory of <HI>New-England</HI>: Nor were they ever more hardly cen&s;ured than by &s;ome of their <HI>own Order,</HI> from whom they might have expected better Things. It will not be denied, that they have had all Manner of Evil &s;poken again&s;t them, and this, in the Face of
<PB N="13" REF="005357_0012_101728F25FCFE3F0">
crowded Auditories. And are there not Numbers, in many Places, who have learned, from their admired Teachers, to give them no better Names than <HI>Phari&s;ees, blind Leaders of the Blind, Oppo&s;ers of</HI> CHRIST, and what not? And han't this Contempt been thrown upon as valuable Mini&s;ters as any the LORD JESUS CHRIST has in the Country, of as known <HI>Soundne&s;s in the Faith,</HI> and as <HI>exemplary a Walk</HI> in Conformity to the Precepts of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P>Let us not be di&s;couraged, my <HI>Brethren</HI>; what tho' we are de&s;pi&s;ed, not only by Men of no Religion, but tho&s;e who pretend to a great Deal? This was the Lot of <HI>in&s;pired Apo&s;tles</HI>; yea, of JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf: And it has often been the Lot of his mo&s;t faithful Mi|ni&s;ters ever &s;ince. Meerly our being de&s;pi&s;ed, is not our <HI>Fault,</HI> tho' it may be our <HI>Unhappine&s;s.</HI> The Fault is, to de&s;erve Contempt; and we cannot, it mu&s;t be own'd, be too much upon our Guard, that there may be no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to charge it upon us: Which leads me to the next Thing, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew wherein Mini&s;ters &s;hould take Care to give no <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of Contempt. And their Care &s;hould be expre&s;t in the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. If they would not be de&s;pis'd, they &s;hould &s;ee to it that they ben't <HI>ignorant.</HI> It was required under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy, that the <HI>Prie&s;t's Lips &s;hould pre&s;erve Knowledge,</HI> becau&s;e the People were to <HI>a&s;k the Law at his Mouth</HI> And the &s;ame Thing is equally nece&s;&s;ary, under the Di&s;pen&s;ation by JESUS CHRIST. Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters &s;hould be as <HI>Scribes in&s;tructed unto the Kingdom of Hea|ven</HI>; they &s;hould be like the <HI>good Hou&s;holder, who can bring out of his Trea&s;ure Things new and old.</HI> 'Tis mentioned by the <HI>in&s;pired Paul,</HI> as an <HI>e&s;&s;ential Qualifi|cation</HI> of a Guide to Souls, that he be <HI>apt to teach,</HI> and <HI>able, by &s;ound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince the
<PB N="14" REF="005357_0013_101728F6B5AD45A0">
Gain&s;ayers.</HI> And can the Mini&s;ter be thus fitted for his Office, without con&s;iderable Degrees of Knowledge? He ought, certainly, to be a Man above the common Level for natural Capacities: Nor is this enough; but his Powers ought to be well cultivated by a good Edu|cation. He ought to have Skill in the learned Arts and Languages, &s;o as to be ready to make u&s;e of them in the Service of the Sanctuary, as Occa&s;ion may call for it: Nor otherwi&s;e will he ri&s;e above ju&s;t Contempt.</P>
<P>It may rea&s;onably be expected of Mini&s;ters, that they &s;hould have made con&s;iderable Attainments, particu|larly in the Knowledge of <HI>Divinity.</HI> How el&s;e &s;hould they be Teachers of others in this noble Art? Shall Men be ignorant in their own Profe&s;&s;ion? How in|congruous is this? What can more &s;trongly tend to render them de&s;picable? What will actually bring up|on them greater Contempt?</P>
<P>Not but that illiterate Men are &s;ometimes mightily cried up; raw ignorant Novices highly applauded and admired: But 'tis only among &s;uch as have need to <HI>abound yet more and more in Knowledge and Judgment:</HI> As for others, who, by Rea&s;on of U&s;e, have <HI>their Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern both Good and Evil,</HI> they readily per|ceive the In&s;ufficiency of Teachers, <HI>under&s;tanding nei|ther what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm.</HI> Nor would it be &s;trange, if, in their Behaviour, they &s;hould ex|pre&s;s the low Opinion they entertain of them. And the Contempt due to &s;uch <HI>blind Guides</HI> will, with Ju&s;|tice, be reflected on others of the &s;ame Order, if they appear forward to invite them into their Pulpits; e&s;pe|cially, if they do it to the Neglect of tho&s;e who are of known e&s;tabli&s;hed Merit, and hereby baulk their own Judgment to fall in with the popular Humour.</P>

of Ignorance: And there are, among our Hearers, a con&s;iderable Number, eminent for their good Sen&s;e and acquired Accompli&s;hments: And it mu&s;t needs be di&s;ta&s;teful to &s;uch, to behold tho&s;e &s;et up for <HI>publick Teachers, who need them&s;elves to be taught which be the fir&s;t Principles of the Oracles of GOD.</HI> They can't help conceiving a mean Thought of &s;uch Medlers with what they are neither qualified for, nor called to; and their being care&s;&s;ed, not only by the <HI>Populace,</HI> (which is no Wonder) but by tho&s;e cloathed with the <HI>&s;acred Character,</HI> is a Damage to Mini&s;ters in general. It makes their Credit run low; and in vain will they complain, if they are treated as a Set of Men knowing very little, though they pretend to know a great Deal.</P>
<P>It will, doubtle&s;s, be here &s;aid, the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them|&s;elves, the fir&s;t Preachers of the Go&s;pel, were a Set of ordinary Men, de&s;titute of the Advantage of Learning. And 'tis readily own'd, the mo&s;t of them were &s;o. But then 'tis ob&s;ervable, they were not allow'd to go forth from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to teach the Nations, <HI>'till they had been endued with Power from on High.</HI> i. e. 'till the HOLY GHOST had, in a miraculous Manner, fitted them for their Work. So that 'tis a Mi&s;take to think the Apo&s;tles commenc'd Preachers, while unfurni&s;h'd for the &s;acred Employment. 'Tis true, they did not pa&s;s thro' a Cour&s;e of Study preparatory to their Mi&s;&s;ion as Mini|&s;ters; but 'tis as true, that the Want of this was abun|dantly made up, by the Effu&s;ion of the HOLY GHOST upon them in miraculous Gifts; enabling them not on|ly to &s;peak with Tongues, but without previous Me|ditation, and &s;o as to be <HI>infallible Guides</HI> to Men, in the Way to Salvation.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, while they are meer Novices, may take upon them the Office of the Mini&s;try, expecting the Be&s;towment of the SPIRIT, in <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts; as in the Days of the Apo&s;tles. But they herein err,

not con&s;idering the Difference between the State of Things <HI>now,</HI> and when the Go&s;pel was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> made pub|lick. It was nece&s;&s;ary the Chri&s;tian Revelation &s;hould be <HI>approved of GOD, by Signs, and Wonders, and Mi|racles, done in the mid&s;t of the People</HI>; and that it &s;hould al&s;o be infallibly delivered to the World, as the &s;tand|ing Rule of Men's Faith and Practice, which, it could not have been, if holy Men had not &s;poken, and wrote it, as mov'd and in&s;pired by the HOLY GHOST: Whereas, there is no Need of the like <HI>extraordinary</HI> In|fluence of the Divine SPIRIT, <HI>now</HI> that Chri&s;tianity has received its Confirmation and been e&s;tabli&s;ht, in the World, as a Religion coming from GOD. Accord|ingly, the Way of becoming qualified to be Mini&s;ters of this Religion is, not by any miraculous Interpo&s;ition of Heaven, but by Attendance to Reading, Meditation and Prayer. In this Way, we may hope, thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, to be furni&s;ht with all &s;utable mini&s;terial Gifts: But if, in&s;tead of Labour and Pains, in the U&s;e of <HI>ordinary</HI> Means, we expect the De&s;cent of the HOLY GHOST in <HI>Tongues of Fire,</HI> or depend on <HI>extraordinary Revelations,</HI> or <HI>immediate Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> we &s;hall only ren|der our &s;elves meet Objects of Contempt. Who have all along been the able&s;t Defenders of Chri&s;tianity? Who have &s;et its Doctrines in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent Light? Who have explain'd and urg'd its Precepts, in the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and convincing Man|ner? Who have been the grand Supporters of its Wor&s;hip and Order? Can this Honour be claimed by your Pretenders to <HI>immediate Revelations,</HI> and <HI>extraor|dinary Influences</HI> from above? Mu&s;t it not rather be given to tho&s;e, who, by hard Study, and a con&s;iderable Stay at the School of the Prophets, have, through a Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endeavours, got their Minds furni&s;ht with de&s;irable Mea&s;ures of Knowledge and good Under&s;tanding? There is no Room for Debate on the Matter. No Man, &s;ince the Days of the Apo|&s;tles, was ever &s;utably qualified for the Mini&s;try, but in
<PB N="17" REF="005357_0016_10172942CEB94980">
the Way of Labour and Pains, in an Attendance on the <HI>ordinary</HI> Means of In&s;truction: And tho&s;e who have left this Way of GOD's Appointing, in Expecta|tion of <HI>extraordinary</HI> Supplies from the SPIRIT, have too commonly, &s;ooner or later, run wild, to the expo|&s;ing, not only them&s;elves, but the whole Mini&s;try, yea, Religion it &s;elf, to Contempt.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly, it will be further urged, does not GOD &s;ometimes take Occa&s;ion, from the Labours of Men of &s;mall Parts, and little Learning, to &s;erve the Ends of his own Kingdom? And if GOD approves of Per|&s;ons of &s;uch a Character, why &s;hould not we? The An&s;wer whereto is ea&s;y. A Di&s;tinction ought always to be made between GOD's Approbation of a Thing, and his taking Occa&s;ion from it to do Good: Nor can the former be at all collected from the latter. 'Tis readily allow'd, the alwi&s;e merciful GOD may over-rule the Mini&s;trations of weak ignorant Men for &s;piritual Advantage to Souls; but it cannot be argued from hence, that he looks upon &s;uch Per&s;ons as fit to be in|tru&s;ted with the &s;acred Mini&s;try. In Order to know his Mind in this Matter, the great Que&s;tion ought to be, what are the <HI>Qualifications</HI> the BIBLE, that public, &s;tanding, authentic Revelation of the Divine Will, makes nece&s;&s;ary to be found in tho&s;e who would be Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters? And if it appears, that it requires <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>con&s;iderable Degrees</HI> of it, tho&s;e only are fit to be put into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e Mini&s;try, who are thus qualified. There is, no Doubt, a Latitude in this Ca&s;e. A Man may be qualified for the Mini&s;try, tho' he &s;hould not be furni&s;ht with Knowledge in the highe&s;t Degrees: But then, he mu&s;t have Knowledge in <HI>&s;uch a Propor|tion as to an&s;wer the Scripture Demands,</HI> or he is certain|ly an un&s;utable Per&s;on to be employed as a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>And this is a Matter of greater Importance than many may be ready to imagine. For 'tis remarkable,
<PB N="18" REF="005357_0017_101728FE534A89A0">
when GOD would repre&s;ent a People as in the mo&s;t deplorable Circum&s;tances, 'tis in &s;uch Language as that, I&s;a. lvi. 10, 11. <HI>His Watchmen are blind: They are all ig|norant; they are dumb Dogs, they cannot bark. &mdash; They are Shepherds that cannot under&s;tand.</HI> On the contrary, when he is returning to a back&s;liding People, in a Way of Mercy, and would be&s;tow the riche&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings on them, that is mentioned as one of the greate&s;t, Jer. iii. 15. <HI>I will give them Pa&s;tors according to mine own Heart, which &s;hall feed them with Knowledge and Under|&s;tanding.</HI> And again, Chap, xxiii. 4. <HI>I will &s;et up Shep|herds over them, which &s;hall feed them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters, if they would not be de&s;pi&s;ed, mu&s;t not &s;et a <HI>bad Example.</HI> The De&s;ign of their Office is to di&s;engage Men from their Vices, and per&s;wade them to a &s;ober, righteous and godly Life, in Conformity to the Precepts of the Go&s;pel. And &s;hall they, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ed Bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to turn Men from the Power of Sin and Satan, be the Servants of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? How un&s;eemly is this? Thou that &s;aye&s;t, a Man &s;hould not commit this, or the other evil Deed, do&s;t thou do the &s;ame thy &s;elf? Thou that magnifie&s;t the Law in thy preaching, do&s;t thou in thy Practice di&s;honour GOD by breaking it? How &s;hocking is &s;uch a Con|duct? And what but Contempt can be the Effect? 'Tis ob&s;ervable, when the <HI>Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Malachi,</HI> departed from the Way of the LORD, and corrupted his Covenant, <HI>The LORD of Ho&s;ts &s;aid unto them, Therefore have I made you</HI> CONTEMPTIBLE, <HI>and</HI> BASE <HI>before all the People.</HI> And the like may be ex|pected by all Mini&s;ters, who behave after the &s;ame ill Manner. 'Twould be ju&s;t in GOD to give them up to Contempt: Nor if they were ba&s;e in the Eyes of the People, would it be beyond their De&s;ert. A vici|ous Man, and yet a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, how gro&s;s the Incon&s;i&s;tency! A Man of GOD, and yet vain, or proud, or covetous, or intemperate, or idle
<PB N="19" REF="005357_0018_10172946038D7450">
and unfaithful, how palpable the Ab&s;urdity! There is not, on the Earth, a more meet Object of Reproach. He has forfeited all Right to the good Opinion of Men; and &s;hould he claim their Reverence, in Virtue of his Office, he would only render him&s;elf &s;till more contemptible.</P>
<P>Nor may it be thought, that &s;uch an one would be likely to do much good. Who would believe, or re|gard, what he &s;aid? He would rather harden Men in Sin, than recover them from it. He would rather make them &s;u&s;picious of the Truth of Religion, than concerned to become the Subjects of it. There are, in one Word, no &s;uch effectual Hinderers of the Go&s;pel, and Ob&s;tacles in the Way of its Succe&s;s, as wicked Mini&s;ters: And the greater the Contempt they meet with, the better.</P>
<P>Only let it be remembred, tho&s;e only ought to be e&s;teemed <HI>wicked</HI> Mini&s;ters, who <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> appear to be &s;o. If there is an agreeable Harmony between the Manner of their <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> they ought not to be loaded with bad Names, and treated with the Contempt due to abandoned Sinners. This, it may be feared, has been too common a Practice in the&s;e Times; but it's being a common Practice won't make it a Chri&s;tian one. We ought not to look into the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Mini&s;ters in&s;tead of their <HI>Lives,</HI> and judge them to be <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> and <HI>unconverted,</HI> from a pre|tended Knowledge of their inward Principles and Springs of Action. This is to a&s;&s;ume to our &s;elves the Prero|gative of GOD, who only has an In&s;pection into hu|mane Hearts, and allows us to judge of one another only from what is <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>vi&s;ible. By their Fruits &s;hall ye know them.</HI> This is the Rule out SAVIOUR has given us; and 'tis a Rule particularly refering to the Ca&s;e of <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and the only one by which we may
<PB N="20" REF="005357_0019_101728FFD97FC560">
form a Judgment of their Character. 'Tis true, they may not be the Men <HI>inwardly,</HI> they appear to be <HI>out|wardly</HI>; but this is none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s. The De|termination of Men's State, does not belong to us, but to JESUS CHRIST, who, when he comes in the Glory of his Father, will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and manife&s;t the Coun&s;els of all Hearts.</P>
<P>I may add to what has been &s;aid, Mini&s;ters, if they would command Re&s;pect, mu&s;t be <HI>Men of exemplary Holine&s;s.</HI> They mu&s;t not think it enough, if they keep at a Di&s;tance from every Thing mean and ba&s;e; if they ab&s;tain from all gro&s;s and notorious Crimes: But they &s;hould expre&s;s a Care to &s;hew out of a good Conver&s;ation their Works with Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom. It &s;hould not content them, that they are blamele&s;s as the Stewards of GOD, not &s;elf-willed, not &s;oon angry, not given to Wine, not given to filthy Lucre; but they &s;hould be Lovers of Ho&s;pitality, Lovers of good Men, &s;ober, ju&s;t, holy, temperate: In all Things &s;hewing them&s;elves Patterns of good Works, and Ex|amples of the Believers, in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity. This was the Direction PAUL gave TIMOTHY, as that which would not only &s;et him above Contempt, but procure for him all &s;utable Re&s;pect: Nor could he have advi|&s;ed to a more effectual Expedient to beautify his Cha|racter, and &s;ecure a good Reputation. There is a &s;trange Power in <HI>exemplary Virtue</HI> to command Rever|ence. It will, beyond the fine&s;t Accompli&s;hments of Learning, or the greate&s;t Eloquence in Preaching, ren|der the Mini&s;ter amiable in the Eyes of People; they can't but love and honour him; yea, even profane Sin|ners, if not given up to a reprobate Mind, will treat him with a decent E&s;teem, while they behold his good Conver&s;ation in CHRIST. And this al&s;o will give a &s;ingular Energy to his Preaching. A <HI>bad Life</HI> will turn the Edge of the keene&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es, delivered from
<PB N="21" REF="005357_0020_1017294A5B973798">
the Pulpit; but when the Mini&s;ter exhibits, in his Be|haviour, a Pattern of what he preaches, his Doctrine will be likely to &s;trike the Mind with a divine Force, and an&s;wer the &s;aving Ends to which it is de&s;igned.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters, if they would not be de&s;pi&s;ed, mu&s;t not expo&s;e them&s;elves by an undue Performance of the <HI>public Offices</HI> of their Station. 'Tis ju&s;tly expect|ed they &s;hould manage the&s;e with a becoming Dexteri|ty; for they profe&s;s to have Ability to do &s;o. And if they are <HI>Blunderers</HI> wherein they pretend to be <HI>Ma&s;|ters,</HI> how &s;hould it be but that they &s;hould &s;ink in the E&s;teem of Mankind? 'Tis thus in all other Profe&s;&s;i|ons: Nor will the Sacredne&s;s of the mini&s;terial Cha|racter prevent its being &s;o here. Mini&s;ters may want the Art of managing in the common Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of Life, and not be thought the wor&s;e of; becau&s;e they pre|tend to no Skill in Affairs of &s;uch a Nature: But they do pretend to have Skill in managing the <HI>public Offices</HI> of Religion. Praying, and Preaching, and over-&s;eeing the Affairs of GOD's Hou&s;e, are the proper Duties of their Calling; and if they are really wanting in a Faculty decently to perform the&s;e Duties, their Character mu&s;t run low in the Opinion of all &s;u|table Judges. But to be di&s;tinct here.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Mini&s;ters &s;hould take Care to manage their <HI>pub|lic Prayers</HI> &s;o as not to expo&s;e them&s;elves to Contempt. It is not indeed to be expected, they &s;hould all be able, in the like ea&s;y, natural, flowing Language, to lead in the Addre&s;&s;es of a Congregation to the Divine Maje&s;ty. Some, it has plea&s;ed GOD to furni&s;h with the Gift of Prayer, to an eminent Degree. They never &s;hine brighter, than when they are called, and it may be on a &s;udden, to repre&s;ent &s;ome &s;pecial Ca&s;e before the Throne of Mercy. Their Mouths are fill'd with Arguments, and they can utter them&s;elves to the Ravi&s;hment of the devout praying A&s;&s;em|bly.
<PB N="22" REF="005357_0021_10172902C880BE18">
But though all are not alike gifted; yet all, methinks, &s;hould be able to go out of the common Road, as Occa&s;ion may call for it, without rambling, or &s;tammering, or running into Tautologies. If any are wanting in &s;uch an Ability, it may be fear'd, whether they have taken that Pains, in the U&s;e of Means, which is proper, in Order to their attaining the Gift of Pray|er. Or, if it &s;hould be the Ca&s;e of &s;ome, that they are born down with Over-mode&s;ty of Temper, or po&s;&s;e&s;s not the Faculty of conceiving quick enough for a ready Utterance, they might do better to pray by &s;ome well-compos'd Form, than to run the Hazard of falling into Contempt by di&s;gu&s;tful He&s;itations.</P>
<P>Nor is it enough that Mini&s;ters pray well as to <HI>Mat|ter:</HI> They &s;hould take Heed to the <HI>Manner</HI> al&s;o, that it be with Seriou&s;ne&s;s, in Oppo&s;ition to all Levity and Airine&s;s of Temper; with an apparent Awe and So|lemnity of Spirit, and with &s;uch an awakened Fervour and Devotion, as &s;hall make it evident, they reali&s;e the Worth, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e &s;piritual and eternal Ble&s;&s;ings, which they a&s;k at the Hands of the great and good GOD.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add here, they &s;hould be particularly careful not to mingle their own Pa&s;&s;ions and Prejudices with their Prayers: Nor &s;hould they oblige a whole A&s;&s;em|bly to be of their Mind, in Matters of doubtful Di&s;|putation, or el&s;e come to an unde&s;ired Pau&s;e in their Devotion. Mini&s;ters, when praying in publick, are to be con&s;idered as the Mouth of the Congregation; and as &s;uch, there is a manife&s;t Impropriety in their going into the U&s;e of &s;uch Petitions, or Thank&s;givings, as a great Part of the Congregation can't, in Faith, join with them in offering up to GOD. I the rather mention this, becau&s;e it may have been too much a Practice, among &s;ome Mini&s;ters, more e&s;pecially in the late Times, to expre&s;s them&s;elves in Language,
<PB N="23" REF="005357_0022_1017294BE22ED2F0">
they could not but know, if they allowed them&s;elves to think, a con&s;iderable Number of tho&s;e they were praying with could not give their hearty Amen to. What others may think I know not; but to me, it appears a Matter of no &s;mall Importance, that there be an Agreement between tho&s;e who pray, re&s;pecting the Things they pray for. And our SAVIOUR him&s;elf &s;eems to have taught as much, in that Declaration of his, Matth. xviii. 19. <HI>I &s;ay unto you, that if any two of you &s;hall agree on Earth, as touching any Thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And it is as &s;utable an <HI>A&s;&s;embly of wor|&s;hipping Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;hould be agreed, re&s;pecting what they a&s;k of GOD in Prayer, as that <HI>two private Per|&s;ons</HI> &s;hould: Nor otherwi&s;e may they encourage a hope, that it &s;hall be done for them according to what they de&s;ire. And if this was more thoroughly con&s;i|dered, it might put Mini&s;ters upon greater Care, &s;o to adapt their Prayers, as that all might harmoni&s;e in &s;ending them up to the Throne of Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Mini&s;ters &s;hould take care that their <HI>Preaching</HI> be &s;uch as may give no Occa&s;ion of Contempt. And here &s;uffer me, with an hone&s;t Freedom and Sim|plicity, to mention &s;ome of the many Things which call for the Care of Mini&s;ters, if they would not be de|&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>And to be &s;ure, they &s;hould not in their Preaching <HI>in|vade the Province of others.</HI> Their Work does not lie at large, but is re&s;trained within proper Bounds. They are Pa&s;tors to particular Flocks: The&s;e are their &s;pecial Charge; they have taken the Over&s;ight of them, and &s;hould employ them&s;elves in feeding them with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding. Not that they are &s;o confin'd, that they may not preach but to their own People. This they may do; but it &s;hould always be within the <HI>Rules of Order.</HI> They &s;hould not go into other Pa|ri&s;hes
<PB N="24" REF="005357_0023_101729049D4C6D60">
to keep up an unrea&s;onable Di&s;affection in Peo|ple to their own Mini&s;ters: Neither &s;hould they pre|&s;ume to preach there, tru&s;ting in them&s;elves that they are righteous, but harbouring in their Brea&s;ts unchari|table Su&s;picions of their Brethren, as carnal and un|converted.</P>
<P>It may look like Zeal for CHRIST, and a vehement De&s;ire to do good to Souls, for Mini&s;ters to go about from Pari&s;h to Pari&s;h, &s;pending them&s;elves and being &s;pent, through their abundant Labours: And they may be care&s;&s;ed on this Account by many Per&s;ons, as having more of the Spirit of CHRIST and his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> than their Brethren. But whatever Charity may be di&s;po&s;ed to hope, GOD only knows the true Spring of &s;uch a Conduct. It may, po&s;&s;ibly, be Pride and Self-Conceit, or a vain Itch to be admired and applauded: And among all who a&s;cribe it to &s;uch a Cau&s;e, (as there are many that will) they will be contemned. But be the Motive what it will, ever &s;o Chri&s;tian, or Noble, the Practice, I believe, is bad; as tending, in the natural Cour&s;e of Things, to introduce Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order: Nor has it ever yet fail'd of &s;inking the Credit of the Mini&s;try, in a le&s;s or greater Degree.</P>
<P>But after all, if any are fond of going about from Place to Place, thinking they &s;hall hereby have Op|portunity of doing GOD good Service; why won't they go where they will invade no Man's Right, nor occa&s;ion Schi&s;ms and Separations. Are there not tho&s;e, even in this Province, and among the Engli&s;h too, (to our Shame be it &s;poken) who are de&s;titute of the Go&s;pel, in the Mini&s;try of it? And are there not va&s;t Numbers, in the neighbouring Governments of VIR|GINIA and NORTH-CAROLINA (not to &s;ay any Thing of the Natives) who live almo&s;t in heatheni&s;h Dark|ne&s;s? And would it not di&s;cover as much Love to Souls, and as di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal to &s;erve the Redeemer's

<P>Nor ought Mini&s;ters to think it enough, if they are careful about the Language of their Sermons; but the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> al&s;o &s;hould be the Effect of Me|ditation and Study.

The <HI>Matter</HI> of their Preaching &s;hould be the pure Go&s;pel of CHRIST.

And this they &s;hould do like Men of Skill; and in or|der to it, &s;hould apply them&s;elves to their Work with Care and Diligence. So <HI>Paul</HI> advi&s;ed <HI>Timothy</HI>; call|ing upon him to <HI>&s;tudy,</HI> if he would <HI>approve him&s;elf to GOD a Workman that needed not to be a&s;hamed.</HI> And he el&s;ewhere recommends to him <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Medita|tion,</HI> that <HI>his profiting might appear to all Men.</HI> And if &s;uch an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Per&s;on as <HI>Timothy</HI> was obliged to the U&s;e of Pains and Study, much more is this a Duty in the <HI>ordinary</HI> Officers of the Church.</P>
<P>Not that a Mini&s;ter, if he has tolerable Qualificati|ons for his Work, need be at much Pains to make Sermons that will plea&s;e &s;ome &s;ort of Hearers.

And though through want of Judgment, they may'nt be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between an <HI>extempore</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e, and one that has co&s;t the Preacher a great Deal of hard Study; yet the latter, if as it ought to be, will be much

better adapted to promote their &s;piritual Profit; and there is more Rea&s;on to expect a divine Ble&s;&s;ing will accompany it to this End. Be&s;ides, a proper Re&s;pect ought to be paid to all Hearers; to the <HI>&s;trong</HI> as well as the weak, to the <HI>knowing</HI> as well as the ignorant&punc; And this there may be, where &s;utable Care has been taken to prepare what is to be delivered in public; for it may be accommodated to the Capacity of tho&s;e who are <HI>illiterate,</HI> and yet &s;o contrived as to fall in with the Reli&s;h of the more <HI>intelligent:</HI> Whereas, if it is crude and indige&s;ted, though it may not be di&s;|lik'd by the weak and injudicious, it will be de&s;pis'd by tho&s;e of better Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be &s;aid, tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who take little or no Thought before-hand what they &s;hall &s;ay, are the Men who depend on the SPIRIT of GOD; and the Help they obtain from him more than makes up for the Want of Preparation by Study. None, I would hope, will e&s;teem Preparation by Study an Ar|gument of the Want of a ju&s;t Dependance on the SPIRIT; for &s;o far is this from the Truth of the Ca&s;e, that they who are mo&s;t careful to make &s;utable Prepa|ration, take the Method in which they may mo&s;t rea|&s;onably expect the divine Influences; and they are the mo&s;t likely Per&s;ons to be favoured with them: Where|as, it may be fear'd, tho&s;e, who venture into the Pul|pit without Fore-thought, pre&s;ume upon the SPIRIT rather than tru&s;t in him; and 'tis too often apparent, that they receive no great Help from him.

Reflection on the ble&s;&s;ed SPIRIT of GOD to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Thing.</P>
<P>It may take with &s;ome People to be told by Mini|&s;ters, they knew not the Text they &s;hould preach from, till they came into the Pulpit; and they may be ready to think the Men in&s;pir'd; e&s;pecially, if they are able to deliver them&s;elves with Freedom and Zeal. But People ought to know, there may be great Warmth and Volubility in Speech, without any extraordinary Help from the SPIRIT. And the plain Truth is, the SPIRIT of GOD does not a&s;&s;i&s;t Mini&s;ters <HI>now,</HI> as in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Days of the Go&s;pel. He did it <HI>then</HI> by <HI>im|mediate Revelation</HI>; he does it <HI>now</HI> in a Way more <HI>humane,</HI> by his Ble&s;&s;ing on their Studies. And while Mini&s;ters, in this Way, depend on his Help, they may humbly hope to obtain it: Whereas they will de|ceive them&s;elves, and impo&s;e on People, if they go a|bout to excu&s;e their Neglects in the U&s;e of <HI>ordinary</HI> Means, pretending to <HI>extraordinary</HI> Communications from above.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters likewi&s;e &s;hould preach as tho&s;e who are in <HI>earne&s;t.</HI> The Bu&s;ine&s;s they are engaged in is the mo&s;t &s;olemn that can be. They have to do with Souls, one of which is of more worth than the whole World: And 'tis their <HI>Salvation</HI> or <HI>Damnation</HI> they are to treat with them upon. And &s;hall they be cold and lifele&s;s in an Affair of &s;uch infinite Importance? Matters of ever|la&s;ting Life and Death &s;hould not be &s;poken of, in ordi|nary Di&s;cour&s;e, but with a becoming Sollicitude: Much more, when Mini&s;ters be&s;peak Men in the Name of GOD, upon the Concerns of Heaven and Hell, &s;hould they do it with all Solemnity of Spirit. And if, when they are talking upon the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing Truths, they &s;peak as if they were a&s;leep, or had not upon their Minds a &s;erious Sen&s;e of their awful Weight and Reali|ty, how can it be that they &s;hould affect the Hearts of
<PB N="29" REF="005357_0028_10172956820E4E60">
their Hearers? They will rather be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;light both them and what they &s;ay? Tho', that they might not do this injuriou&s;ly, they &s;hould be very careful they don't run into Mi&s;takes, taking that for <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> in &s;ome, and an <HI>awakened Fervour</HI> in others, which may be no certain Indication of either. The Tempers of Mini&s;ters are very different, and &s;o are their Organs of Speech; in&s;omuch, that if they had all the &s;ame Con|cern about &s;piritual and divine Things, they would not be alike in the Manner of its Di&s;covery. And it ought to be particularly notic'd, <HI>meer Loudne&s;s of Voice</HI> is no Sign at all of a &s;utable Frame of Mind. There may be the <HI>&s;till &s;mall Voice,</HI> and the Heart, at the &s;ame Time, &s;eriou&s;ly and thorowly warm'd with a Sen&s;e of eternal Things; as on the other Hand, there may be a <HI>noi&s;y boi&s;terous Fervency,</HI> that is only <HI>hi&s;trionical</HI> and <HI>af|fected:</HI> And it very ill becomes the Mini&s;ter, and tends rather to harden Sinners than do them any &s;piritual Good. There is very little therefore to be collected meerly from the Voice of the Preacher. The <HI>Manner</HI> is more to be regarded: And if he really feels what he &s;ays, be his Voice great or &s;mall, it will ordinarily be perceived by di&s;cerning Hearers. And he &s;hould always endea|vour to &s;peak, not as tho' it were a Ta&s;k, and he cared not what he &s;aid; but as having upon his Mind an a|wakened Sen&s;e of the Worth of Souls, and the Weight of everla&s;ting Concerns.</P>
<P>Further, Mini&s;ters, in their Preaching, &s;hould apply to the <HI>Under&s;tandings</HI> of their Hearers, and not lay out all their Endeavours to work on their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Not that 'tis improper to &s;peak to the <HI>Affections</HI>; for they have their U&s;e in Religion, and it may &s;erve a great many good Purpo&s;es to excite and warm them. But then, it ought to be remembred, the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> is the leading Power in Man, and ought, as &s;uch, in the fir&s;t Place, to be applied to. To be &s;ure, the Under|&s;tanding ought not to be neglected. Light and Heat
<PB N="30" REF="005357_0029_1017290EE664C028">
&s;hould always go together, and keep Pace with each other: Nor unle&s;s there is a due Proportion of the former, will it turn to any good Account, if there be ever &s;o much of the latter: Nay, Heat in the Affecti|ons, without Light in the Mind, will &s;erve rather to make Men wild, than religious; as has been too often verified by &s;ad Experience. Whenever the Pa&s;&s;ions therefore are addre&s;t to, a good Foundation ought to be fir&s;t laid in the Under&s;tanding: Or otherwi&s;e, the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be manag'd &s;o as to inform the Mind, at the &s;ame Time it kindles the Affections. And now the Preaching is &s;uted to work, in a regular Man|ner, upon the Powers of humane Nature; and if the Effect is not the &s;piritual Edification of Hearers, they can rea&s;onably reflect the Blame no where but on them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>A rambling incoherent Di&s;cour&s;e delivered in terri|ble Language, and with great Vehemence of Voice and Action, will have, I am &s;en&s;ible, a more powerful Tendency to di&s;turb the Pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially of &s;ome People. But where is the Advantage of throwing the Pa&s;&s;ions into a Tumult? Of what Service can it be to rai&s;e them to &s;uch a Height, as that the due Exerci&s;e of the rea&s;onable Nature &s;hall be ob&s;tructed? 'Tis true, Men may, in this State, appear to be religious, and this to an extraordinary Degree; but their Nature all the while is inverted, tho&s;e Powers got to be uppermo&s;t which were made to be kept under Re&s;traint: And while they continue in this Condition, under the Government of their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> in&s;tead of their <HI>Under&s;tandings,</HI> they are in extreme Hazard; for there is no Wildne&s;s, whether in Theory or Practice, but they are liable to be driven into it. The &s;hort of the Matter is, as Men are rea|&s;onable Creatures, they are to be preached to as &s;uch. The Addre&s;s &s;hould be made, not &s;o much to their Pa&s;&s;ions as to their Under&s;tandings; at lea&s;t, all pro|per Care &s;hould be taken to enlighten the Mind, and
<PB N="31" REF="005357_0030_10172958098977A0">
convince the Judgment, as well as to move the Affec|tions. And if in&s;tead of &s;peaking to the <HI>Minds</HI> of Men, Mini&s;ters will lay out all their Pains to work upon their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> as though herein lay the whole Value of Religion, they will certainly expo&s;e them&s;elves to all, who have any tolerable Acquaintance with the Frame of humane Nature.</P>
<P>Moreover, Mini&s;ters in their Preaching &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the great and <HI>important Truths</HI> of Religion, and not be&s;tow their greate&s;t Pains upon le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Points; the <HI>Circum&s;tantials</HI> and <HI>Externals</HI> of Divine Wor&s;hip: Much le&s;s &s;hould they &s;pend their Breath about needle&s;s Que&s;tions, which <HI>mini&s;ter to Strife,</HI> rather than <HI>godly Edi|fying.</HI> The&s;e are not the Things which &s;hould take up their Thoughts and Labours, unle&s;s they intend to bring them&s;elves into Contempt. If they would acquit them|&s;elves with Honour, they mu&s;t dwell upon tho&s;e Truths, which have a near and clo&s;e Connection with the Sal|vation of Men's Souls; &s;uch as the undone State of Man by his Apo&s;tacy from God, and the Method of his Recovery, as reveal'd in the Go&s;pel. And as 'tis by JESUS CHRIST, and him alone, that a new and living Way has been open'd for the Entrance of Sinners into the holy Place, HE &s;hould be the great Subject of all our Sermons. Their main Scope &s;hould be, to unfold the My&s;tery which was hid from Ages and Generations, but made manife&s;t in the&s;e la&s;t Days, by the Incarnation of our JESUS, and the &s;everal Offices he has &s;u&s;tained and executed, in our Nature, and in Order to effect our Salvation.</P>
<P>I may ob&s;erve here, the Scripture ever takes notice of three Things with Reference to the Affair of Man's Redemption. The fir&s;t is the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD <HI>purpo|&s;ing</HI> it. It's particular in its Care to fix our Thoughts on the Good-will and free Mercy of GOD, as the true, original, eternal Source of this Ble&s;&s;ing. Next to the
<PB N="32" REF="005357_0031_1017291204FD82F8">
Grace of GOD, it gives all due Honour to the <HI>Merits</HI> of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. 'Tis with a View to him, for his Sake, and on his Account, that the Sinner is &s;poken of as ju&s;tified and &s;aved. The&s;e great Go&s;|pel Favours are granted to him, not for any Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which he has done, but in Con&s;ideration of the mediatorial Performances and Sufferings of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Redeemer is con&s;idered as the Ground and Rea&s;on, that on the Account of which he is intere&s;ted in the Mer|cy of GOD to eternal Life. But be&s;ides the Grace of GOD, and the Merits of CHRIST, there is what the Scripture calls a <HI>Meetne&s;s</HI> for the Inheritance, a Pre|paredne&s;s in the Frame of the Sinner's Heart for the heavenly Glory, wrought in him by the Power of the HOLY GHOST. And without this, 'tis as impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be happy as that Light &s;hould have Communi|on with Darkne&s;s, or CHRIST with Belial. He mu&s;t be chang'd from a Servant of Sin, to a Servant of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; he mu&s;t be made to put off the old Man, and to put on the new Man, or he cannot inhe|rit the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>And now, the&s;e are the Things which &s;hould com|prehend the Sum of our Preaching; and the rather, becau&s;e, in their proper Place, they are all nece&s;&s;ary, and equally nece&s;&s;ary, in order to Salvation. Had it not been for the infinite Compa&s;&s;ions of the All-mer|ciful GOD, he never would have purpo&s;ed, or accom|pli&s;hed our Redemption. Had it not been for the LORD JESUS CHRIST, what he did and &s;uffered in our Nature and Stead, we &s;hould have had no Title to Sal|vation, no Righteou&s;ne&s;s that would have been a &s;uffi|cient Ground for the Be&s;towment of this Mercy. And if we are not transformed by the renewing of the HOLY GHOST; if we are not made holy in the internal Frame of our Minds, in Conformity to the Image and Will of GOD, neither the Grace of GOD, nor Merits of the
<PB N="33" REF="005357_0032_1017295B1857F2E8">
REDEEMER will be of any Avail to our Salvation: For while under the Dominion of Sin, and in Slavery to e|vil Pa&s;&s;ions and corrupt Inclinations, we harbour Mi&s;e|ry in our Brea&s;ts; and could we be &s;uppo&s;ed, in this Condition, to have a Right to Heaven, and to go there, we &s;hould really carry the very Seeds of Hell along with us: Nor could we be happy, as rea&s;onable Creatures, even in that Place of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think it enough, if, in their Preaching, they magnify the Grace of GOD, and do honour to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST; but 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary al&s;o that they explain to Men, and urge upon them, that Holine&s;s of Heart and Life, without which they cannot &s;ee the Lord; together with the <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Influence</HI> of the HOLY SPIRIT in the Work of Sancti|fication. The&s;e Things are all in&s;i&s;ted on in the <HI>Bible,</HI> and &s;everally repre&s;ented as having a nece&s;&s;ary Con|nection with Salvation: And they &s;hould, in like Man|ner, be in&s;i&s;ted on by Mini&s;ters in their Preaching. There is no Incon&s;i&s;tency between the Truths, but a perfect and glorious Harmony. Men may, 'tis true, confound them in their Thoughts; they may place their own Holine&s;s in the Room of CHRIST, or the the Grace of GOD; making it &s;erve a Purpo&s;e it was never intended to, nor is &s;ufficient for: And &s;o, under the Notion of exalting the Grace of GOD, or the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the REDEEMER, they may entertain a Thought of inherent per&s;onal Holine&s;s, as a Thing almo&s;t in&s;ignificant. But in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, they abu&s;e the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, conceiving ami&s;s of the&s;e Truths. For they <HI>all</HI> have their U&s;e in the Af|fair of Salvation; yea, in their proper Place, they are <HI>all</HI> nece&s;&s;ary: Nor can there, be Salvation with|out them <HI>all.</HI> And People &s;hould be told &s;o by Mini|&s;ters. 'Tis indeed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office to &s;et the&s;e Truths in a clear and di&s;tinct Light; and to this End &s;hould their Preaching be mainly calculated.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005357_0033_1017291575925330">Only, as there is Danger le&s;t proud Man &s;hould a&s;|cribe too little, in the Affair of Salvation, to the Grace of GOD, and depend upon his <HI>own Works</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s by Faith,</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;hould be particu|lar in guarding again&s;t this Fault: Tho' they &s;hould take Care, in the doing of it, that they don't run into the contrary Extreme; &s;peaking after &s;uch a Manner of per&s;onal evangelical Holine&s;s, as to make it of very little Service: Whenas 'tis a Matter of &s;uch Impor|tance, that without it we are barr'd Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, both by the Appointment of God, and the Frame of our own Natures. And they &s;hould the rather be con&s;tant in affirming, that they which have believed in GOD might he careful to main|tain good Works, becau&s;e 'tis too common a Thing for profe&s;t Chri&s;tians to be negligent of a good Life; yea, it would be well, if they were not &s;ometimes in a Temper of Mind to take Occa&s;ion, even from the Grace of GOD, to continue in Sin.</P>
<P>Moreover again, Mini&s;ters &s;hould be <HI>uniform</HI> in their Preaching; making it appear that they are Men of fixed and &s;teady Principles. Not that they may not change their Minds, if they have unhappily fallen into Error, and ju&s;t Grounds of Conviction are laid before them. It would be to their Honour, in this Ca&s;e, to own their Mi&s;take; and no wi&s;e Man would think the wor&s;e of them for it, but the better. But a Change of Sentiment, ari&s;ing from a thorow deliberate Examina|tion, is a Thing quite different from a fluctuating and incon&s;tant State of Mind: And if, from &s;uch a vo|latile Di&s;po&s;ition, Mini&s;ters are pepetually wavering in their Thoughts, to Day of this Mind, and to Mor|row of another, it will very much tend to weaken their Credit: Nor may they expect any Thing &s;hort of Con|tempt, if they <HI>tempori&s;e</HI> in their Sermons, &s;peaking one Thing to one People, and another Thing to another, on Purpo&s;e to &s;ute their Humours, and recommend

them&s;elves to the &s;everal Parties there may be among them.

It may, for the pre&s;ent, 'tis true, be of &s;ome Di&s;&s;ervice to our Intere&s;t; but, in the End, it will bring us into E&s;teem, and &s;ecure for us a la&s;ting good Reputation: Whereas, if we &s;hift and change, to gain the Applau&s;e of this, and the other Party, we &s;hall not only act a mean and ba&s;e Part, but take the ready Way to expo&s;e our&s;elves to Contempt: And it &s;eldom happens, but &s;uch <HI>Servility</HI> meets with its ju&s;t De&s;ert, &s;ooner or later.</P>
<P>In fine, Mini&s;ters &s;hould not be wanting in a Care about the <HI>external Manner</HI> of their Preaching. This indeed is a Matter of the lea&s;t Importance; though, perhaps, mo&s;t recommending to the Generality of Peo|ple: For which Rea&s;on, it would not be mi&s;pent La|bour, if Mini&s;ters took &s;ome Pains that they might be Ma&s;ters of a <HI>good Pronunciation,</HI> and <HI>becoming Ge&s;ture</HI>: To be &s;ure, they &s;hould avoid di&s;agreeable <HI>Tones</HI> and <HI>Whines</HI>; as al&s;o unnatural <HI>Di&s;tortions of Countenance,</HI> and <HI>Motions of the Body</HI>: Neither &s;hould they turn <HI>Mimicks,</HI> endeavouring to <HI>&s;peak</HI> and <HI>act,</HI> not like them|&s;elves, but tho&s;e they admire: They may herein Aim at being more agreeable, but they really make them&s;elves ridiculous. Above all, they &s;hould take Heed of &s;peaking and acting as if they were be&s;ide them&s;elves; for, in this Ca&s;e, People will be apt to take them to be &s;o, and treat them with the Contempt due to &s;uch.</P>
<P>The&s;e now, and &s;uch like are the In&s;tances, in <HI>Preach|ing,</HI> which &s;hould employ the Care of Mini&s;ters, if they would not be de&s;pi&s;ed. I go on, and &s;ay,</P>

If <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> is an Ordinance of JESUS CHRIST, it ought to be made U&s;e of, in Obedience to him, upon all &s;utable Occa&s;ions: Nor may Mini&s;ters expect any other than to be <HI>ba&s;e</HI> in the E&s;teem of People, if they &s;neak &amp; cringe, and pro&s;|titute this In&s;titution of the Son of GOD to the Pre|judices, Pa&s;&s;ions, or Humors of Men.

Our Fa|thers found the Advantage of it in their Day; and it would be of like Service in ours, wi&s;ely and faithfully admini&s;tred, both for the Credit of the Mini&s;try, and the Edification of the&s;e Churches in Peace and Ho|line&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the la&s;t Place, Fourthly, Mini&s;ters &s;hould take Care they don't hurt their Character, by an undue Per|formance of the <HI>more private Duties</HI> of their Calling. Their Duty is not confin'd to their <HI>public</HI> Admini&s;trati|ons: They have a great Deal to do in <HI>private</HI> a|mong their People. They mu&s;t vi&s;it the &s;ick, com|fort the Mourners, in&s;truct the ignorant, warn the wicked, reduce the wandring, &s;trengthen the feeble-minded, bind up the broken-hearted; and, in &s;hort, &s;ute their Coun&s;els, and Warnings, and Con&s;olations, to the re&s;pective Ca&s;es of tho&s;e they have to do with. And they &s;hould be always in Readine&s;s to attend <HI>the&s;e Du|ties</HI> of their Station; not &s;pending &s;o much of their Time about &s;ecular Employments, or in Studies foreign to their Office, as to take them off from the faithful Di&s;charge of them: Neither &s;hould they be partial in their Re&s;pects; but endeavour, by all Means, to do Good to <HI>all,</HI> preferring no one before another.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005357_0037_1017291B56604198">In a Word, Mini&s;ters will unavoidably have frequent Occa&s;ions to conver&s;e with their People: and they &s;hould ever be careful to do it, after &s;uch a Manner as not to be thought moro&s;e, haughty, or un&s;ociable; yet &s;hould they keep at a Di&s;tance from every Thing light, and vain, or mean. They &s;hould be conde&s;cending, but not &s;ervile; they &s;hould be plea&s;ant and affable, yet &s;olid and grave; and though they &s;hould not be backward to religious Di&s;cour&s;e, yet they &s;hould take Care that it be brought in &s;o as not to look forc'd and affected: And the whole of their Conver&s;ation &s;hould be &s;uch, as may have a Tendency to pre&s;erve in the Minds of People, both a Love to them, and a Venera|tion of them.</P>
<P>And having thus, in a plain, though imperfect Manner, con&s;idered a few of the many In&s;tances, where|in the Care of Mini&s;ters is nece&s;&s;ary, if they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves to Contempt; I now go on,</P>
<P N="3">III. In the la&s;t Place, to repre&s;ent the Obligations which lie upon them to expre&s;s this Care. And the&s;e are &s;olemn and weighty. The <HI>Honour</HI> of CHRIST calls for it; the <HI>Succe&s;s of their own Mini&s;try</HI> depends very much upon it; Nor can they otherwi&s;e give a <HI>good Account of them&s;elves another Day</HI>: To which I might add the Regard they owe to the <HI>Credit of the Clergy in Common.</HI> The&s;e are the Particulars the Time will per|mit me but briefly to touch upon.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Honour</HI> of CHRIST is concerned in the Care of Mini&s;ters not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. They are his Ser|vants, as they act in his Name, and by Authority de|rived from him. And &s;hall they e&s;teem it a &s;mall Thing, whether they are ba&s;e, or honourable in the E|&s;teem of Mankind? If they are de&s;pi&s;ed, and the Con|tempt comes through their own Faulty Imprudences, will not the Di&s;grace, however unju&s;tly, be reflected on
<PB N="39" REF="005357_0038_101729648BEA4EE8">
him who &s;ent them? What greater Abu&s;es have been offered to the Name of CHRIST, than tho&s;e which have been occa&s;ioned by the Follies and Vices of Mi|ni&s;ters? And &s;hall the Thought of being thus inju|rious to our LORD and SAVIOUR &s;it ea&s;y on our Minds? Shall we be unmindful of our Character, and take no Pains to act up to the Dignity of our Office, when our MASTER will &s;uffer &s;o much through our Neglect? Who&s;e Honour &s;hould we be tender of, if not his who has &s;eparated us from our Brethren, and called us by his Grace to the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel? The Ho|nor of the REDEEMER &s;hould lay near our Heart: And yet, what more di&s;tant from it, while our Conduct is &s;uch as tends to make us contemptible; for the Con|tempt will finally, though injuriou&s;ly, be turn'd upon CHRIST him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Succe&s;s of our Mini&s;try</HI> depends very much upon our not being held in Contempt. If People have a de&s;picable Thought of us, of what Advantage will our Preaching be to them? They will conceive the &s;ame Opinion of our Sermons, as they do of our Per|&s;ons; And &s;hould we preach the pure Truths of GOD, and do it with the Eloquence of Angels, it would have little or no good Effect upon them. The <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old &s;eem, in this, to have been well ac|quainted with humane Nature. For when they would ob&s;truct the Mini&s;try of our SAVIOUR, it was by ba&s;e Attempts to le&s;&s;en his Reputation. <HI>Is not this,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>the Carpenter's Son</HI>? And they wickedly mi&s;re|pre&s;ented him to the People as one of a bad Character, a Profaner of the Sabbath, a Friend to Publicans and Sinners; and, in &s;hort, a Per&s;on of no Religion him&s;elf, and that would keep them from having any too, if they minded what he &s;aid; rightly judging, that, if they could but de&s;troy his Credit, they &s;hould, at the &s;ame Time, render his preaching in&s;ignificant: And &s;o it unhappily prov'd, in re&s;pect of Multitudes, in that Day.
<PB N="40" REF="005357_0039_1017291E8C65B8A8">
And the Effect will be the &s;ame <HI>now,</HI> and in all <HI>future Time</HI> to the End of the World. There is indeed no &s;uch Thing as preaching &s;o as to an&s;wer any good End, where Mini&s;ters have lo&s;t their Reputation, and in&s;tead of Re&s;pect are tho't of with Contempt by People. <Q>We may ob&s;erve (as One expre&s;&s;es it), when Men are prepo&s;&s;e&s;t in Favour of any one, every Thing almo&s;t which he &s;peaks, appears weighty and &s;igni|ficant. Opinion gives Lu&s;tre to, and begets a high E&s;teem even of his Weakne&s;&s;es. When Opinion hath rai&s;ed a Man up to a great Height, there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;ublime and extraordinary in all his Performances. On the contrary, when a Man's Cre|dit is &s;unk and under Water, what little Regard is paid to what he &s;ays? He is under &s;uch an unhappy Di&s;advantage, that if he could &s;peak like an <HI>Oracle,</HI> it would hardly &s;tick and make an Impre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>And what a powerful Argument is this to engage our Care that we don't expo&s;e our &s;elves to Contempt? Are we content to live u&s;ele&s;s? Are we willing to go on in a Round of attending the Duties of our Calling, and do no good? Thus 'tis likely it will be, if we do not look to our &s;elves, and take &s;utable Care to main|tain a good Character. It is this that mu&s;t prepare Men's Minds for a favourable Reception of what we preach.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we do not u&s;e did proper Mea&s;ures to keep from Contempt, we &s;hall not be able to give a <HI>good Ac|count of our &s;elves another Day.</HI> Not but that it may be our Lot to be de&s;pi&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t faithful Endeavours to de&s;erve the E&s;teem of People: In which Ca&s;e, the greater the Contempt we have pa&s;&s;|ed through, if we have behav'd well under it, the brighter will be our Crown in the Day of CHRIST. But if we have brought Contempt on our &s;elves, by our Follies and Vices, the Fault is our own. And if
<PB N="41" REF="005357_0040_101728DE26A520A0">
by thus rendring our &s;elves de&s;picable, we have not on|ly hindered the Efficacy of our Mini&s;try, but unhappi|ly been the Occa&s;ion of the Ruin of tho&s;e Souls, we might have &s;aved; how dreadful will be the Account we mu&s;t give up unto GOD! Should the People of our Charge acco&s;t us at the Bar of CHRIST; We were &s;tum|bled at your Imprudences; we were unhing'd, in our religious Sentiments, by your Un&s;teddine&s;s; we be|came indifferent to the Practice of Piety, through your Want of Zeal in recommending it to us; we gradually lo&s;t all &s;erious Sen&s;e of Divine Things, hardened our &s;elves in Sin, and &s;ettled in Profane&s;s and Infidelity, from the loo&s;e, vain, evil Example you &s;et before us: I &s;ay, &s;hould our People thus be&s;peak us, before the Tribunal of Judgment, how would it cut us to the Heart, and pierce our very Souls? Should they go on, and &s;ay; Had you behav'd &s;o as to gain our E&s;teeem and Reverence; had you preached, and con|ver&s;ed, and lived, &s;o as to render Religion amiable in our Eyes; had you been faithful in your Warnings, &s;kilful in your Coun&s;els, and watched for our Souls as tho&s;e who were earne&s;tly de&s;irous of their everla&s;ting Salvation, it had not been with us, as it is at this Day. To you it is, in a great Mea&s;ure owing; to your Negligence and Un&s;aithfulne&s;s; to your Want of Love to our Souls, and Care of their everla&s;ting Well-Being, that we are now plac'd at the left Hand of CHRIST, and mu&s;t be doom'd to a Departure from him, into the Place of weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of Teeth. Would not &s;uch a Charge as this make every Joint of us to tremble? Should not we be &s;truck with Horror to be thus challeng'd by the Souls committed to our Over&s;ight, in the great and terrible Day of the LORD? There is no Guilt like that of the Blood of Souls. It crieth for Ven|geance: And O who can conceive the Weight of Vengeance we mu&s;t &s;uffer, when Multitudes of lo&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="005357_0041_1017292016F86AB8">
Souls &s;hall ri&s;e up, and call for it to be poured out upon us!</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the Souls of our <HI>own proper Charge,</HI> we &s;hall, if we make our &s;elves mean, be accoun|table for all the Damage that may herefrom ari&s;e to Religion in general; which will be greater than we can well imagine. Contempt will ea&s;ily and naturally be derived from our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to the Cau&s;e we are ma|naging; in&s;omuch, that if we are <HI>ba&s;e</HI> in the Opinion of the World, Religion will be &s;o too. When <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sons, by their &s;hameful Mi&s;conduct in the <HI>Prie&s;t's Of|fice,</HI> had <HI>made them&s;elves vile,</HI> the next Thing we hear of is, that <HI>Men abhorr'd the Offerings of the LORD.</HI> And the Effect will be the &s;ame now. If Mini&s;ters behave &s;o as to forfeit their Credit, it will make Way for the Prophanation of divine Ordinances, or a Neglect to attend on them; and from Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s about the Things of Religion, Men will proceed to violate its &s;acred Laws, and from one Degree of Wickedne&s;s they will go on to another, 'till they have made them&s;elves abandoned Sinners. And do we think the Blame of this no Ways belongs to us? It will <HI>all,</HI> if we have ju&s;tly expos'd our &s;elves to Contempt, be charged on us, to the aggravating our Condemnation, in the Day of reckoning. And better would it have been for us, if we had never been born. In vain &s;hall we plead that we have prophe&s;ied in CHRIST's Name, that we have broken the Bread of Life, and poured forth the Wine of Salvation;&mdash;It will rather expo&s;e us to the more angry Re&s;entments of our Judge: Nor will any of the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI> drink deeper of the Cup of the LORD's fiery Indignation. I may add, in the la&s;t Place,</P>
<P N="4">4. We are bound to the U&s;e of all proper Care not to fall into Contempt, becau&s;e of the <HI>Damage</HI> which may hereby accrue to the <HI>Mini&s;try in Common.</HI> Were the Hurt confined to our &s;elves, the Obligation would be
<PB N="43" REF="005357_0042_1017296A96E0A8B0">
the le&s;s; but it will probably &s;pread from our <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> in general will &s;uffer through our Mi&s;management. This, it mu&s;t be owned, is very unfair. The Body of the Clergy ought not to be tho't the wor&s;e of, becau&s;e &s;ome may make them&s;elves vile. But &s;uch is the Temper of the World, that they will not re&s;train their Contempt to the <HI>particular</HI> Mini&s;ters who may de&s;erve it, but will extend it to <HI>all</HI> of the &s;ame Order. And very &s;evere have been the Reflecti|ons on the <HI>whole Clergy,</HI> as occa&s;ion'd by the ill Conduct of a few. It is too common, indeed, upon the Mi&s;car|riage of one, to hear it &s;aid, they are all alike; and &s;ometimes the <HI>Office</HI> it &s;elf mu&s;t be a&s;per&s;ed, and even the Wi&s;dom of GOD called in que&s;tion for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing it. And &s;hall not a Regard to the <HI>mini&s;terial Order</HI> make us careful of our Credit? We &s;hould certainly take heed, we do not expo&s;e our &s;elves to Contempt, be|cau&s;e if we do, it will not re&s;t on our own Per&s;ons, but will more or le&s;s affect the <HI>whole Body of Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>The APPLICATION remains. And</P>
<P N="1">1. We learn from what has been &s;aid, that the Work of Mini&s;ters is <HI>very difficult.</HI> The Pains they mu&s;t take to keep from being de&s;pi&s;ed &s;hows it to be &s;o. How hard a Thing is it to attend the vari|ous Duties of our Office, &s;o as to de&s;erve the E&s;teem of People, and Pre&s;erve in their Minds a becoming Re&s;pect for us? Unle&s;s we are Men of good na|tural Abilities, and acquired Accompli&s;hments; at the &s;ame Time, maintaining a Care of good Works, it is impo&s;&s;ible: And even in this Ca&s;e, what Caution and Prudence, what active Zeal and Diligence, what Re&s;olution and Courage, are nece&s;&s;ary? <HI>O who is &s;uffi|cient for the&s;e Things!</HI> If an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of JESUS CHRIST cried out under the Weight of Care that lay upon him, how much more Rea&s;on have we to do it, who are not endowed with his <HI>Graces</HI> or <HI>Gifts</HI>? We can't be too
<PB N="44" REF="005357_0043_10172925E5419518">
&s;en&s;ible of the Need we &s;tand in of divine Help: Nor can we too frequently repair to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find the Grace that may be &s;ufficient for us.</P>
<P N="2">2. What Rea&s;on have Mini&s;ters to be <HI>humbled,</HI> that they have taken no more Care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from Contempt? Who of us can &s;ay, that our Con|duct has been unexceptionable? That we have be|hav'd in our Office &s;o as to give no Occa&s;ion of Re|proach? Dare we, any of us, the be&s;t of us, lay our Hands upon our Hearts, and ju&s;tify our &s;elves before GOD? We have all, at one Time or another, acted below our Character, in a le&s;s or greater Degree: And the more &s;en&s;ible we are of it, and humbled for it, the more worthy we &s;hall be of Re&s;pect and Honor. And have we not, &s;ome of us, &s;o expos'd our &s;elves as that <HI>human Frailty,</HI> cannot be our Excu&s;e? Are we none of us, by criminally neglecting our Studies, le&s;s know|ing in Things pertaining to the Kingdom of CHRIST, than we might and ought to have been? Have we none of us too often ventured into the Pulpit, when we have had nothing to &s;ay there, but what, through Want of previous Meditation and Care, has been crude and indige&s;ted, and &s;itted rather to bring us into Di&s;|credit with judicious Hearers, than to profit their Souls? Have we, none of us, been too carele&s;s of our Lives, behaving after &s;uch a Manner as to prejudice People again&s;t Religion, rather than recommend it to their Love and Practice?</P>
<P>I &s;ay not the&s;e Things to &s;ugge&s;t Evil of the <HI>Body of the Mini&s;ters of this Generation</HI>; for I really believe, and would take this Opportunity to declare it, that they are as pious, and faithful, and laborious a Set of Men, as any Part of the Chri&s;tian World is favoured with. I am indeed &s;en&s;ible they are too commonly de&s;pi&s;ed at this Day, and to as great a Degree as was ever known in the
<PB N="45" REF="005357_0044_1017296EE9959970">
Country; but I tru&s;t in GOD, the Contempt is injurious. Not that I think it is &s;o, in Re&s;pect of them all: And 'tis, perhaps, principally owing to <HI>&s;ome of our own Or|der,</HI> that the Credit of the Mini&s;try runs &s;o low. Are there none among us, who&s;e Conduct, in the late Day of Trial, has led People into a mean Thought of Mi|ni&s;ters in general? Did we all di&s;cover that Know|ledge of the World, and of the Frame of human Na|ture, and act with that prudent Foreca&s;t, which might have been expected of Men of our Character? Did we all &s;tand up for the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and in <HI>De|fence</HI> of its <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Ways,</HI> with the Courage and Faithfulne&s;s which became the Servants of JESUS CHRIST? Have we, none of us, too much connived at tho&s;e <HI>Errors in Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>Irregularities in Prac|tice,</HI> which have had a dreadful Tendency to &s;ink the Credit of the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> yea, and of <HI>Religion</HI> too, in the Land? Have we, none of us, invited into our Pul|pits Men of mean Parts, and no Learning, at who&s;e Performances we our &s;elves have been a&s;hamed? Have we, none of us, taken Part with tho&s;e, who have treat|ed the be&s;t Mini&s;ters in the Country with Neglect, to &s;ay nothing wor&s;e? Have we, none of us, had the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of &s;ome particular Mini&s;ters <HI>in Admiration,</HI> to the reflecting an unju&s;t Odium on others? Have we not flattered them beyond all Bounds of Mode&s;ty, and by our Flatteries &s;trengthened their Influence to hurt the Reputation, and together with it the U&s;efulne&s;s of the <HI>Min&s;try,</HI> GOD has &s;et up in <HI>the&s;e Churches?</HI> And what is wor&s;e than all this, have we, none of us, acted in the proper Charges of our Brethren, &s;o as to leaven the Minds of their People with evil Surmi&s;ings again&s;t them, though Men of as good Reputation for their mini&s;terian Gifts and Faithfulne&s;s, as our &s;elves? Have we not &s;poken of them in a Manner &s;o cen&s;orious and uncharitable, as to bring them into Di&s;e&s;teem, in their own Pari&s;hes? Have we not &s;ided with People in the Di&s;grace they have heaped upon them? Have we not
<PB N="46" REF="005357_0045_101729707017B8C8">
encouraged them in their Alienations, Di&s;affections and Separations? Or, if we have had too much Policy, or too little Courage, to be <HI>open</HI> in the&s;e Things, have we not by <HI>&s;ecret Whi&s;pers,</HI> and <HI>Clo&s;et-In&s;inuations,</HI> done the Bu&s;ine&s;s as effectually? I charge nothing upon any in particular; but GOD knows, and we all know, that there has been great Guilt as to the&s;e Things: And &s;o far as we are any of us, Sharers in it, we have Rea&s;on for deep Humiliation before GOD. A <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> Mini|&s;try will be a <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> one. Wherein therefore we have had a Hand in bringing our Brethren into unde&s;erv'd Contempt, we have done great Di&s;&s;ervice to the Inter|e&s;t of the REDEEMER; nor could we, in any Thing, have more pleas'd the Enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s: For his Kingdom is never more likely to be in a flou|ri&s;hing State, than when the Mini&s;try of a Land is in|juriou&s;ly held in Contempt. The good LORD humble and pardon us all, wherein we have been faulty! And may we be more upon our Guard in Time to come!</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters &s;hould do what they can to <HI>keep one another from being de&s;pi&s;ed</HI>; not by countenancing one another in Wickedne&s;s; nor yet by &s;tanding up for each other, in that which is a Di&s;honour to Men of our Character. This would be to bring, both our &s;elves, and the whole Mini&s;try, into Di&s;grace. But we &s;hould be tenderly concerned for the Reputation of our <HI>Fellow-Labourers</HI> in the LORD, and ready, in all &s;utable Ways, to advance it. We &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to pre|fer our Brethren in Love, to hope well, and believe well, and &s;peak well of them, &s;o far as there is Rea&s;on to do &s;o. And if it is the Unhappine&s;s of any to be treated with Di&s;re&s;pect, not becau&s;e they are in them|&s;elves worthle&s;s; or have acted a mean and ba&s;e Part, but becau&s;e they have to do with &s;uch as are unrea&s;on|ably prejudiced again&s;t them, we &s;hould both pity them, and u&s;e our be&s;t Endeavours, as we may have Opportunity, to wipe off the Dirt that is thrown up|on
<PB N="47" REF="005357_0046_10172928D9FF0780">
them. To be &s;ure, we &s;hould not encourage <HI>Bu&s;y-Bodies</HI> in coming to us with their idle tatling Stories; neither &s;hould we &s;trengthen <HI>contentious</HI> Men in their Alienations and Di&s;affections; much le&s;s &s;till may we allow our &s;elves in <HI>&s;ecret Whi&s;pers</HI> to the Di&s;advantage of our Brother, while we dare not tax him to the Face, with the Evil we in&s;inuate behind his Back.&mdash;Mini&s;ters may do a great Deal to &s;upport the Reputation of one another; and if they would heartily endeavour to do it, &s;o far, I mean, as they might with Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee the <HI>Clergy</HI> in better Repute than they enjoy at this Day.</P>
<P N="4">4. How careful &s;hould Mini&s;ters be to <HI>introduce none into the &s;acred Office</HI> who are like to be de&s;pi&s;ed? We are the Per&s;ons to whom it belongs, according to the Appointment of JESUS CHRIST, to &s;eparate Men to the Work of the Mini&s;try: And we ought to be cautious on whom we <HI>lay Hands</HI> for this Purpo&s;e. We &s;hould not <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> do it in an Affair of &s;uch Impor|tance; nor indeed at all, till fir&s;t &s;atisfied, that the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of the Per&s;ons are &s;uch, as that there is no Pro&s;pect of their falling into Contempt. And in Or|der to this, there &s;hould be &s;ome <HI>Trial</HI> of them before they are intru&s;ted with the Care of Souls. It might be be&s;t, if we countenanced none in <HI>preaching</HI> 'till they had fir&s;t been <HI>examin'd.</HI> I know it has been a long Cu&s;tom for <HI>young Men</HI> to go into the Pulpit, when they them|&s;elves think fit to do &s;o. Perhaps, the Churches in this Land are the only ones, who take &s;o little Care in a Matter of &s;uch Con&s;equence to the Intere&s;t of the Kingdom of CHRIST. 'Tis high Time it was rectifi|ed: And if, as a Means to &s;o good an End, Mini&s;ters would be peremptory in refu&s;ing their Pulpits to <HI>all</HI> Candidates, 'till they had pa&s;s'd their <HI>Trials</HI> before proper Judges, it might be of &s;ingular Service.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005357_0047_101729736226FF08">To be &s;ure, all rea&s;onable Care &s;hould be taken, that none be &s;et apart for the Service of CHRIST, in the Go&s;|pel-Mini&s;try, but <HI>faithful Men</HI>; &s;uch as are both <HI>apt,</HI> and <HI>able to teach</HI>; &s;uch as are of <HI>good Behaviour,</HI> and have a <HI>good Report without.</HI> Raw, ignorant, unfurni&s;h|ed Men, ought never to have committed to them the Admini&s;tration of divine Ordinances.

<P N="5">5. We &s;ee, from what has been &s;aid, the Rea&s;on we have to be thankful for the <HI>Means of Education</HI> among us. Not but that &s;ome, in the&s;e Days, have expre&s;&s;ed a mean Opinion of <HI>Learning,</HI> and of the <HI>Colleges,</HI> where are the be&s;t Means for the Acquirement of it. It is a Pity any in <HI>holy Orders</HI> have been &s;o unadvi&s;ed as to lead People into this Thought. They are herein very unlike to our pious <HI>Fore-Fathers,</HI> who had &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Learning</HI> as a Qualification for the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> that they &s;oon founded a <HI>College</HI> in the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and Straits and Difficulties; from whence, through the Smiles of Heaven, our Churches have, all along, been &s;upplied with <HI>able</HI> Mini&s;ters; Men who have been a Credit to the &s;acred Function, and, I may &s;ay, an Honour to the Country. And &s;hall this, and the other School of the Prophets more lately erected, be now &s;lighted and neglected? We ought rather to rank them among&s;t the riche&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings, which call for our Thankfulne&s;s to Almighty GOD: Nor can we lay our&s;elves out too much to &s;trengthen the Reputati|on

and U&s;efulne&s;s; e&s;teeming them the be&s;t Security again&s;t an <HI>ignorant,</HI> and therefore a <HI>contemptible</HI> Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And it were to be wi&s;hed, the young Men, in the&s;e Schools, would wi&s;ely improve the Price put into their Hands to get Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding. And let me advi&s;e the <HI>Candidates of the Mini&s;try,</HI> tho&s;e in par|ticular who may be here pre&s;ent, not to ru&s;h too ha&s;tily into the <HI>&s;acred Employment,</HI> le&s;t they expo&s;e not only them&s;elves, but Religion al&s;o to Contempt. Give your|&s;elves to Reading, Meditation and Prayer; and conti|nue in the&s;e Things, 'till you have attained, under the Divine Influence, a &s;utable Furniture, both of <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> for the Service of the Sanctuary. And don't tru&s;t your own Judgments in a Matter of &s;o great Importance. And, if you &s;hould be urg'd to enter upon Preaching, by tho&s;e who know not whether you are qualified for the Bu&s;ine&s;s, be not overcome to yield to their Entreaties; but wait 'till you are declared <HI>fit,</HI> by &s;uch as are proper Judges in the Ca&s;e. And don't be di&s;couraged from Labour and Pains to get furni&s;h'd with con&s;iderable Mea&s;ures of <HI>Learning,</HI> both <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Humane,</HI> becau&s;e, as the Times are, it may be of little Service to recommend you to the E&s;teem of ma|ny People. The State of Things, it is to be hop'd, won't always continue as at pre&s;ent: or however, you will find the Advantage of previous hard Study, thro' your whole Life; be&s;ides that you will be hereby qua|lified to be greater Ble&s;&s;ings, in your Day, wherever the Providence of GOD &s;hall fix your Place of Labour.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>People</HI> &s;hould learn, from what has been &s;aid, not to de&s;pi&s;e Mini&s;ters, nor do any Thing that may tend to bring them into Di&s;credit. I mean not, <HI>Brethren,</HI> to blame any of you for entertaining a mean Tho't of Mini&s;ters, or expre&s;&s;ing the low Opinion you have of them, when, by their Behaviour, they have forfeited a Right to your Regards. 'Tis fit and proper your Sentiments of, and

Conduct towards us, &s;hould be adju&s;ted to our <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Character? And if we make our &s;elves <HI>contemptible,</HI> we ought to be <HI>ba&s;e</HI> in your E&s;teem. But then, you &s;hould take Care you don't de&s;pi&s;e us, when we give you no &s;ufficient Occa&s;ion to treat us with Contempt. You &s;hould not watch for our Halting, nor aggravate every Infirmity we may be betray'd into; but be rea|dy to make all rea&s;onable Allowances in our Favour, con&s;idering we are Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions with your&s;elves, and liable not only to the &s;ame, but to more and great|er Difficulties and Temptations. Don't de&s;pi&s;e us for common Frailties, but rather cover them with the Man|tle of Charity. Don't take up, and harbour in your Brea&s;ts, unju&s;t Prejudices, either again&s;t our <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> or the <HI>Office</HI> we &s;u&s;tain: In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, &s;hould we behave ever &s;o circum&s;pectly, you would turn every Thing to our Di&s;advantage: Nor would it be in our Power, &s;hould we both <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>live</HI> like <HI>Angels,</HI> to make you think well of us. Take Heed e&s;pecially, that you do not de&s;pi&s;e us for tho&s;e Things, which ought rather to recommend us to your Veneration. If we reprove you for your Vices, don't be di&s;affected to us; for this we mu&s;t do, or we cannot be faithful to him who &s;ent us. If we &s;ee you expos'd to Danger, or turning out of the <HI>good old Way,</HI> don't take it ami&s;s if we are free in telling you of it; for we are moved hereto from the Love we bear to you. If we &s;tand up in Defence of the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Or|der</HI> of the Go&s;pel, don't &s;ay we are <HI>carnal,</HI> and treat us as though we were your Enemies, and the Enemies of JESUS CHRIST; for 'tis in Obedience to him, and out of Compa&s;&s;ion to your Souls, that we thus run the Hazard of your Di&s;plea&s;ure. In a Word, dive&s;t your Minds, as much as may be, of every wrong Bia&s;s, and candidly form your Sentiments of us, not from this or the other particular Action, not from our being of this or the other Party; but from what appears in our <HI>ge|neral
<PB N="51" REF="005357_0050_1017297980A8CED8">
Conduct</HI>: And if this is &s;uch as will allow you to think honourably of us, be in a Temper to do &s;o; and do not carry it towards us with Neglect, much le&s;s Contempt, unle&s;s there is evident Rea&s;on given for it: And then, if we find Fault, we &s;hall be unju&s;t to you, and partial to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>And you &s;hould not only take Care, that you do not de&s;pi&s;e us, but that you do not do any Thing that may tend to bring us into Di&s;credit. If any of you &s;hould not reli&s;h our Manner of preaching, as not be|ing &s;o well &s;uted to your particular Turn of Mind, do not prejudice others again&s;t it, who may be both grati|fied and profited by it. If any of you &s;hould be &s;o defective in your Charity as to &s;u&s;pect, whether we are the Men <HI>inwardly</HI> we appear to be outwardly, do not leaven the Minds of others with the like evil Surmi&s;|ings; don't &s;peak of us as <HI>Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing</HI>; do not &s;o much as <HI>whi&s;per</HI> a Thing &s;o injurious to our Character. If any of you &s;hould be fond of the Preaching of Men of &s;mall Capacities and no Learn|ing, do not &s;o in&s;i&s;t upon our taking them into our Pulpits, or &s;eparating them to the Work of the Mini|&s;try, as to force us to di&s;oblige you, or expo&s;e our|&s;elves to tho&s;e who have more Knowledge and Judg|ment.</P>
<P>And here let me recommend to you one Thing, which, if duly con&s;idered, would be of great Service to the <HI>Credit</HI> of the Mini&s;try; and that is, that you be well &s;atisfied, not only of the <HI>good Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of your Children, but their <HI>Promptne&s;s to learn,</HI> before you de|vote them to the Service of GOD, in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of his SON. Don't think it will tend, either to <HI>their Re|pute,</HI> or the Benefit of the <HI>World,</HI> to give them an <HI>Education,</HI> with a View to the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> if their <HI>natural Abilities</HI> are of the <HI>lower Size.</HI> They may better <HI>&s;erve their Maker, and Generation,</HI> in &s;ome other

Employment. They may have a <HI>Genius</HI> for one or other of the various Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of Life, though not a Turn of Mind fitted to make them &s;hine as <HI>Mini&s;ters:</HI> And 'tis Pity, their U&s;efulne&s;s in the World &s;hould be ob&s;tructed, by a Mi&s;take in their Education which can't ea&s;ily be afterwards mended. And if your Circum&s;tances in Life &s;hould &s;et you above your Neighbours, either in Point of Riches, or Honour, do not think it will be a Di&s;grace to you, to devote your Sons to the Work of &s;erving at GOD's <HI>Altar,</HI> if they appear to be peculiarly di&s;pos'd to it, and form'd for it. 'Tis true, they will not, in this Station of Life, be in the Way of <HI>worldly Preferments</HI>; but yet, what more noble Employment than that of <HI>Co-workers</HI> with CHRIST, in forming Men to a <HI>Meetne&s;s</HI> for the eternal Service and Enjoyment of GOD in Heaven? And if your Sons &s;hould be <HI>In&s;truments</HI> in turning ma|ny Sinners to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, would not this reflect an Honor, even upon you, both in this World, and that which is to come?</P>
<P>Let me further &s;ay, as Mini&s;ters, when low in the World, and hard put to it for a Livelihood, are too often de&s;pi&s;ed, take Care you don't withhold from them more than is meet. And where 'tis the Lot of any to be fix'd among People, who, thro' Prejudices again&s;t the Go&s;pel, do little towards their Sub&s;i&s;tence, &s;uffer me to be&s;peak for them your charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for tho&s;e e&s;peci|ally, who, at the De&s;ire of this <HI>Convention,</HI> and as en|couraged by Promi&s;es of Help from them, have gone forth into &s;uch difficult Service. One De&s;ign of our being now together is, to contribute to the Support of the&s;e <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI>; and, I doubt not, you will join with us in this Act of Piety. We have had Experi|ence of your Goodne&s;s in former Collections, and tru&s;t the pre&s;ent one will be enlarged through your Libera|lity. May we all, both <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> freely give as we have freely received; and to our Bounties
<PB N="53" REF="005357_0052_1017297F5AFE4740">
let us add our Prayers, that the&s;e Servants of the LORD may be carried through all their Difficulties, and &s;uc|ceeded in their Endeavours to do Good to Souls, to the Joy of their Hearts here, and the brightning their Crown of Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>In fine, and above all, &s;ee to it, as you have any Value for our Credit, that our Mini&s;try be not lo&s;t upon you. If you reap no &s;piritual Profit by our La|bours for the Good of your Souls, but continue in your Sins, and grow wor&s;e in&s;tead of better, nothing will have a more dreadful Tendency to bring us into Di&s;|grace. The Language of your Impenitence will be, that we are a u&s;ele&s;s Set of Men: Nor will the Ene|mies of Religion fail of improving it to our Reproach. Whereas, if, under our Mini&s;try, you are effectually taught to deal ju&s;tly, and love Mercy, and walk hum|bly with GOD, this would put to Silence tho&s;e who might be di&s;pos'd to &s;peak Evil again&s;t us, and procure for us a Name better than precious Ointment. If, by Means of our Preaching, you are convinced of Sin, and turn'd from the Power of it; if your Tempers are rectified, and Manners reform'd; if you are really brought to love GOD and your Neighbour, and, in one Word, to po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e that Faith and Hu|mility, and all tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Graces, wherein the I|mage of GOD and the Power of Religion do truly con&s;i&s;t, we &s;hall not need any other Recommendation; you will then be a living &s;tanding Proof of our U&s;e|fulne&s;s: And we &s;hould herefrom be under Advantage to do &s;till greater Service, to our own Comfort in this World, and our &s;hining, in the next, as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</P>
<P>And now, may we all, both <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> receive what we have heard, &s;o far as it is the Truth in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in the Spirit of Love and Meekne&s;s. 'Tis probable, we &s;hall never all of us be together again in

this Hou&s;e. The Faces of &s;ome, who were pre&s;ent the la&s;t Year, we &s;hall &s;ee no more, 'till we meet in the Day of the appearing of the SON of MAN. May we look to our&s;elves, and &s;o behave in our Stations, as that we may then be found at the right Hand of CHRIST, and have Admi&s;&s;ion into that Kingdom, prepared be|fore the Foundations of the World, where we &s;hall no more be in a Temper to de&s;pi&s;e, nor &s;hall ever give Occa&s;ion for Contempt; where we &s;hall no more treat one another with Bitterne&s;s, Anger and Clamour, but live together in perfect Love and Peace; where, in|&s;tead of differing and contending with each other, we &s;hall all be of one Mind and one Heart; joining with the innumerable Company of Angels and glorified Saints, in &s;aying with a loud Voice, Ble&s;&s;ing, and Ho|nor, and Glory, and Power, be unto HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE, and unto the LAMB for ever and ever. Amen, and Amen.</P>
