<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THE King Eternal, Immortal, Invi&s;ible,</HI> is the <HI>only wi&s;e GOD.</HI> There is but One only living and true GOD, and infinite Wi&s;dom is e&s;&s;ential to Him. <HI>He is the light, and in Him is no darkne&s;s at all. Wi&s;dom</HI> in general is reckon'd to con&s;i&s;t, in pitching upon &s;ome <HI>&s;uitable &amp; proper end,</HI> and then taking the <HI>be&s;t method</HI> to obtain that end. The highe&s;t &amp; be&s;t <HI>end</HI> (according to our conception) that GOD Him&s;elf can pitch upon, is <HI>His own Glory. He hath made all things for Him&s;elf. Of him, thro' him, to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</HI> GOD <HI>glorifies Him&s;elf,</HI> in <HI>exerting</HI> &amp; <HI>manife&s;ting</HI> his Perfecti|ons of <HI>Power, Holine&s;s, Goodne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o far as the marks or &s;ignatures of GOD's perfections appear in his works (whether Men duely ob&s;erve them or not) &s;o far they &s;hew forth <HI>His glory.</HI> P&s;al. <HI>19.1. The heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work.</HI> And the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of GOD very particularly appears, in &s;o contriving, directing, or attempering (if we may &s;o expre&s;s it) the manife&s;tation of the divine Attributes, that there &s;hall be no Incon&s;i&s;tence or
<PB N="ii" REF="002987_0003_0FE648CD125C5140">
Jarring, but the mo&s;t beautiful con&s;ent, harmony and agreement between them. This Harmony is apparent in all GOD's works, <HI>(P&s;al. 104.24. O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all,)</HI> but very brightly and con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;hines forth, even in the mo&s;t lively colours, in the great affair of Redeeming Sinful Men, thro' <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> our <HI>LORD. P&s;al. 85.10. Mercy and Truth are met together; Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &amp; Peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other.</HI></P>
<P>This truth is well illu&s;trated, demon&s;trated, and applied in the following Sermons, compos'd (as I think is very evident) with much diligent &s;tudy, and by the gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, <HI>who is the wi&s;dom of GOD, &amp; the power of GOD;</HI> and in whom are bid, <HI>all the Trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge.</HI> As the&s;e Sermons mu&s;t needs have ca&s;t the Reverend Author much study &amp; la|bour in compo&s;ing them, &s;o they tend directly (by the divine ble&s;&s;ing) to yield great profit to &s;erious and diligent Readers; being well adapted &amp; &s;uited, to in&s;truct the Ignorant, and alarm the hardened, to rouze &amp; awaken the &s;tupid &amp; &s;ecure, to guide the doubting, to unhinge &s;elf-confident Hypocrites, to comfort the feeble-minded, to &s;upport the weak: Indeed to animate to the Mortification of every corruption, and to the exerci&s;e of every Grace, and practice of every Duty. As the&s;e Sermons evi|dence, that the Author <HI>&s;tudies to &s;hew him&s;elf approved unto GOD, a workman that need not be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, and faithfully di&s;pen&s;ing the my&s;teries of GOD</HI>; &s;o al&s;o do his other mini&s;terial performances publick

and private: &s;o that I have often thought, it's a great favour not only to the Church and Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> but al&s;o to the <HI>College</HI> (and therein to the whole Province) that he is fixed in that publick Po&s;t and Station, a&s;&s;ign'd by Providence to him. I pray GOD long to continue his Life and Health, and make him more and more a ble&s;&s;ing to all he's concern'd with. Tho' he's but <HI>Young,</HI> yet his labours are very In&s;tructive and Profitable.</P>
<P>And here I would take occa&s;ion to &s;ay, 'tis with great plea&s;ure &amp; delight, that I've read the printed Di&s;cour&s;es of many of the <HI>Younger Mini&s;ters</HI> in the Province. They &s;o plainly teach, and urge the belief of Scripture-truths; &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s a compliance with what the Go&s;pel requires, in the mo&s;t Important Articles of <HI>Repentance of Sin, Faith in CHRIST, and Obedience to Him;</HI> &s;o zealou&s;ly di&s;&s;wade from all Wickedne&s;s, and exhort to all Holine&s;s in Heart and Life; that I've taken great &s;atisfaction in reading of them. To me it looks like an hopeful &s;ymptom, that GOD yet has Mercy in &s;tore for this poor, &s;in|ful, degenerate People (among whom the Power of Godline&s;s is much decay'd) in that He rai&s;es up (as others are taken off by Death) &s;o many able and faithful Mini&s;ters among them. The LORD greatly increa&s;e the Number of &s;uch, and multiply the Gifts and Graces of His Spirit to them! May it plea&s;e the LORD more and more to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;ucceed His Mini&s;ters, and make them In&s;trumental of &s;aving good, to va&s;t multitudes of Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002987_0005_0FE6AEE20F78D890">And as our <HI>College</HI> and <HI>Schools</HI> have hitherto been great ble&s;&s;ings to this Land, in training up able &amp; faithful Mini&s;ters to di&s;pen&s;e the My&s;te|ries of GOD; &s;o, may the divine &s;miles long continue tho&s;e Seminaries, even to late&s;t Po&s;terity, that there may proceed from thence, &s;treams making glad the city of GOD, even many Sons of Renown, who &s;hall take this People by the Hand, and lead them in the right ways of the LORD!</P>

who <HI>excel</HI> in Wi&s;dom as well as <HI>Strength,</HI> he <HI>charges with folly,</HI> Job. 4.18. GOD has made very bright and clear di&s;coveries of this Perfection in all his Works. There are vi&s;ible marks, and Characters of it in every Creature that he has made; and if we would but take pains to view the World, and ob&s;erve the wonderful contrivance there is in every part of it, how they are &s;uited to one another, and how they are all accommo|dated to an&s;wer their various intentions; we &s;hould all break forth in holy admiration with the devout P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 104.24. <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wi&s;dom ha&s;t thou made them all.</HI> But now in none of the Works of GOD does this Perfection appear more Glorious than in the Work of our <HI>Redemption</HI> by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In this, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle in the Text, <HI>He has a|bounded toward us in all wi&s;dom and prudence.</HI></P>
<P>The holy Apo&s;tle, in the foregoing Ver&s;es of this Chapter, we find Ble&s;&s;ing and Prai&s;ing GOD for <HI>all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Christ</HI>; which GOD had ble&s;&s;ed his People with. And here he In&s;tances, Fir&s;t, in their <HI>Election and Prede&s;tination,</HI> as the &s;pring and fountain of all other Ble&s;&s;ings; and then in their Regeneration, and Sanctification, their Adoption, their Accept|ance with GOD, and their Pardon. And now all the&s;e benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of Redemption, he tells us, are <HI>in and thro' the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Thus they were <HI>cho&s;en in him,</HI> that is in Chri&s;t, <HI>that they &s;hould be holy and without blame, v.</HI> 4. So they were <HI>Prede&s;tinated to the Adoption of
<PB N="3" REF="002987_0008_0FE6AEECC1B40518">
Children by Chri&s;t Je&s;us. v.</HI> 5. And they are &s;aid to be <HI>accepted in the beloved, that is,</HI> the be|loved Son of GOD, <HI>v.</HI> 6. and to have <HI>Redemp|tion thro' his blood, even the forgivene&s;s of their Sins, v.</HI> 7. And now as our Redemption is a&s;|cribed to Chri&s;t, as what he had purcha&s;ed by his Blood: &s;o is it at the &s;ame time a&s;cribed to the free rich and &s;overeign Grace of GOD. Thus we are &s;aid to be Adopted by Chri&s;t Je&s;us; but it is <HI>according to the good plea&s;ure of his Will.</HI> And we are &s;aid to be accepted, in the Beloved, but it is <HI>to the prai&s;e of the glory of his Grace.</HI> And altho' we have Redemption thro' his blood, even the forgivene&s;s of Sins: Yet this is <HI>according to the riches of his Grace.</HI> As in the fore men|tioned ver&s;es. And now the Apo&s;tle con&s;i|dering how our Redemption was purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, and &s;o Divine Ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, and at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame act, Divine Grace, and the riches of it magnified; he ob&s;erves, as in our Text, that <HI>herein</HI> GOD had <HI>abounded towards us in all wi&s;dom and prudence.</HI> That is, in this work of our Redemption he has not only abounded towards us in Grace and Mercy, but in all Wi&s;|dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>And therefore from the&s;e Words I propo&s;e to con&s;ider &s;omething of the Infinite Wi&s;dom of GOD in our Redemption. I &s;ay, <HI>Something</HI> of this Wi&s;dom: for it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;earch into the depths of Divine Wi&s;dom in this grand affair. There are &s;uch Depths of Wi&s;dom, and &s;uch Un&s;earchable My&s;teries in it, that the An|gels

tho&s;e bright Intelligences, with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s and inten&s;ne&s;s are looking into them; yet they cannot fathom them: much le&s;s can it be expected from &s;uch &s;hallow &s;hort &s;ighted Creatures as we. However a &s;erious Meditation of the&s;e things, may &s;erve to enlarge our thoughts of GOD in this Wonderful Contrivance, and may rai&s;e our Hearts in the highe&s;t Admiration and Adoration of what we cannot comprehend. And therefore this is the Doctrine that by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance I propo&s;e to &s;peak to from the words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>In the Method GOD has taken, for the Redemption of Mankind, there are Glorious Manife&s;tations of Infinite Wi&s;dom, and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text tells us that herein GOD has abound|ed towards us, in all Wi&s;dom and Prudence: there are abundant riches, unfathomable depths of Wi&s;dom, in this wonderful work.</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e for the clearing this Doctrine, is,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. Briefly to explain the <HI>Nature of Wi&s;dom</HI>; and &s;how what it is, and wherein it con&s;i&s;teth.</P>

<P N="2">II. <HI>Prove the Doctrine</HI>: and &s;how there are Glorious Manife&s;tations of Wi&s;dom in the Me|thod GOD has taken for the Redemption of Man.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to explane the</HI> Nature <HI>of Wi&s;dom; and &s;how what it is, or wherein it con&s;i&s;ts&punc;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002987_0010_0FE6AEF16A0D1B30">Now in General; Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in propo|&s;ing the mo&s;t <HI>Noble Ends</HI>: and then in project|ing and pro&s;ecuting the mo&s;t proper, and &s;uitable <HI>Means</HI> for the accompli&s;hment of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing the mo&s;t noble Ends.</HI></P>
<P>Wi&s;dom belongs only to National Beings: only to &s;uch as are capable of actual de&s;ign, &amp; inten|tion: of aiming at, and propo&s;ing &s;omething as their end in what they do. And now the Wi&s;|dom of &s;uch a Being partly con&s;i&s;ts in propo|&s;ing &s;uch ends, and having &s;uch things in view, that are the mo&s;t <HI>Excellent</HI> and worthy of the aims, and de&s;igns of &s;uch a Being. Thus Wi&s;|dom, as applied to Man, con&s;i&s;ts in his con&s;ider|ing his own Nature, the dignity and capacity of it; and in aiming at tho&s;e things that are &s;uitable to, and worthy of &s;uch a Nature. And now con|&s;idering what GOD is in him&s;elf; and the rela|tion he &s;tands in to us; the glorifying and the enjoying of him are the highe&s;t and the noble&s;t ends we can propo&s;e for our &s;elves. Accordingly for a Man to aim at the&s;e things, principally, and at other things only in a Subordination and Sub&s;erviency to the&s;e; is &s;o far a point of Wi&s;|dom. Whereas on the other hand; he that is thoughtle&s;s, and unconcerned about the&s;e things, and has his thoughts and de&s;igns carried no high|er than to the gratifications of his lu&s;ts, and car|nal de&s;ires; is guilty of folly, and is looked upon as a fool in the &s;ight of GOD, and of every truly wi&s;e Man. But then Wi&s;dom don't altogether
<PB N="6" REF="002987_0011_0FE6AEF184805BE8">
con&s;i&s;t in the bare <HI>aiming</HI> at &s;omething that is great and excellent; for a Man may oftentimes have very good aims and de&s;igns; by which altho' he may obtain the Character of an hone&s;t, yet not of a wi&s;e Man. For</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in pitching upon the mo&s;t proper means, for accompli&s;hing the ends pro|po&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>When a Man propo&s;es any thing that is wor|thy of a Man, to propo&s;e and aim at: and when he is able to lay all things together in his own Mind, to &s;ee the difficulties, and inconveniences on one &s;ide; and the dangers on the other: and is able to pitch upon the mo&s;t direct, the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and the mo&s;t effectual methods, to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es; &s;o as to &s;teer clear of all the incon|veniences, or difficulties that attend either &s;ide: I &s;ay, in thus fixing upon the be&s;t rules and me|thods for the accompli&s;hing any affair, lies a great part of Wi&s;dom. But</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It con&s;i&s;ts in pro&s;ecuting the&s;e Methods, for the accompli&s;hing the end propo&s;ed, with &s;uch vigour, diligence, and con&s;tancy, as the nature of the thing requires.</HI></P>
<P>Wi&s;dom is not meerly Speculative: but Prac|tical. He is not the wi&s;e Man that aims well; or projects a good Scheme, for the accompli&s;hing his end: but he that practi&s;es upon it, puts his Scheme into execution, and pro&s;ecutes his de&s;igns in proportion to the nece&s;&s;ity and importance of
<PB N="7" REF="002987_0012_0FE6AEF892CE83A0">
them. When he pur&s;ues things of the greate&s;t Moment and Importance, &amp; wherein there is the greate&s;t danger of mi&s;carrying, with the great care, watchfulne&s;s &amp; a&s;&s;iduity; while he pur&s;ues matters of an inferiour Nature in a more &s;lack and moderate manner. Such an one may be ju&s;tly termed a Wi&s;e Man, a Man of Prudence.</P>
<P>But then Wi&s;dom appears more or le&s;s con|&s;picuous, according to the nature, and circum|&s;tances of the Affair about which it is exerci&s;ed. Thus if it be a plain and ea&s;y ca&s;e; attended with little or no difficulty in the contrivance, or management of it: if it be a ca&s;e that Men are acquainted with: and the way wherein it mu&s;t be managed, lies plain before us, without any &s;tudy or deep thought about it; this Wi&s;dom wont ap|pear very con&s;picuous. But when the ca&s;e is difficult, and greatly perplexed, when almo&s;t every one that thinks of it, is po&s;ed and puz|led about it, and knows not which way to turn, but there appears in&s;uperable difficulties in the way; then for a Man in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to &s;ee clearly into it, to contrive and pur&s;ue a way wherein he may &s;teer clear of all the difficulties that &s;eem to lie in it, and accompli&s;h his end; this makes his Wi&s;dom to &s;hine, and appear glorious in the eyes of others. So that it is in perplexed, and diffi|cult ca&s;es, that Wi&s;dom is to be tried, and exer|ci&s;ed, and the fulle&s;t proofs, and manife&s;tations given of it.&mdash;Now the&s;e hints may &s;erve to give &s;ome Idea of the Nature of Wi&s;dom in general, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts. And &s;o I proceed to the Second thing propo&s;ed, which was,</P>

But it was the Advancement of his declarative Glory (as it is &s;ometimes called by Divines) That is, to &s;peak intelligibly; He did not propo&s;e to add to his Perfections; for that he knew was impo&s;&s;ible, but he propo&s;ed to make his Perfections <HI>appear</HI> more Glorious and Con&s;picuous to all his Rational, and Intelligent Creatures, that are capable of beholding his Works, and ob&s;erving tho&s;e Divine Perfections that are Exerci&s;ed, and Manife&s;ted in them. Indeed GOD's manife&s;ting his Glory in this man|ner,
<PB N="9" REF="002987_0014_0FE6AEFC4A0F9790">
is what he aims at in all his Works: this was what he had in view, in the Work of Crea|tion; and his end was an&s;wered by it. For the <HI>Invi&s;ible things of him,</HI> that is, his being and per|fections, <HI>from the Creation of the World, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made: even his Eternal Power and Godhead,</HI> Rom. 1.20. And it is the &s;ame thing he had in view, in the work of our Redemption. The main and prin|cipal de&s;ign of GOD herein was, to manife&s;t and di&s;play the Glory of all his Perfections, and not any one of them in particular; &amp; make them all &s;hine more Glorious in the Eyes of his Creatures. It was to make known his almighty power, his un&s;potted holine&s;s, his inflexible ju&s;tice, his un|&s;earchable depths of wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and the immen&s;e riches of his goodne&s;s, and grace.</P>
<P>And now what more noble end; and more wor|thy of GOD than this, could he propo&s;e? For as I &s;aid before: He could not propo&s;e to advance his e&s;&s;ential glory and happine&s;s, becau&s;e it is infi|nite. And now next to <HI>that,</HI> what could he pro|po&s;e &s;o proper and &s;uitable, as to have this his Glory manife&s;ted, &amp; acknowleg'd among his Crea|tures? to let them &s;ee and behold more, and more of his Greatne&s;s and his Glory? What greater, or better thing could GOD propo&s;e, than to manife&s;t his Glory &s;o to all his Rational Creatures, in Heaven, and Earth, as that they may be moved, and excited thereby, to give him the glory due unto his Name; to adore him as the mo&s;t High GOD; to love and fear him; to obey and &s;erve him, to &s;ubmit to him; to place their Happine&s;s in the
<PB N="10" REF="002987_0015_0FE6AEFC5E0BC1D8">
enjoyment of him, and to place their confidence in him! Surely if any thing, this is worthy of GOD to aim at; in any of his Works: nay in|deed, there is nothing el&s;e worthy of the great GOD, to aim at in his works; &s;ave in a &s;ub&s;er|viency and &s;ubordination to this. And thus &s;o far as a good end and de&s;ign will go; the Wi&s;dom of GOD appeared in our Redemption. For the highe&s;t, and noble&s;t end that could be, was propo&s;ed in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Wi&s;dom of GOD in our Redemption appears, by <HI>con&s;idering the Difficulty and &s;eeming Impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining the end propo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>GOD (as I ob&s;erved before) propo&s;ed to advance the glory, not only of &s;ome, but of all his Perfecti|ons in our Redemption. He propo&s;ed not only to make known the riches of his Mercy and Grace, but al&s;o his power, ju&s;tice, truth and holine&s;s. But here lay the difficulty: <HI>viz.</HI> in not only maintaining the harmony of the&s;e attributes; but in making them all appear more Glorious than ever, in the Salvation and Recovery of fallen Man. And it was a difficulty that all the Men on Earth, or all the Angels in Heaven, could never overcome. They could not find out a way to reconcile them; much le&s;s to advance the glory of them in &s;uch a work. For we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that Man had wilfully &s;inned, and &s;o de&s;troyed him&s;elf: he had broken Covenant with GOD, and turned Rebel again&s;t him; and had thereby expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the Penalties of the Law, that were threatned in ca&s;e of di&s;obe|dience: and now if GOD had without any con|&s;ideration
<PB N="11" REF="002987_0016_0FE6AF03B7EE92B0">
overlooked the willful violation of his law, which was &s;uch a practical contempt of his Authority, and abu&s;e of his Goodne&s;s: and had pardoned and acquitted Sinful and Rebellious Man; it would indeed have magnified and illu&s;t|rated the Infinite Grace, and Mercy of GOD; it would have &s;hown him to be a GOD of Infinite compa&s;&s;ion: but what would have become of all the other Perfections? How could the honour of them have been &s;ecured; if GOD had pardoned and &s;aved Sinners? How would he have &s;ecured the honour of his Ju&s;tice, which inclines and ob|liges him, to a&s;&s;ert, and maintain the Rights and prerogatives that belong unto him; and con&s;e|quently to &s;ee to it, that every Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion re|cieve a ju&s;t recompence of reward? And how could he have &s;ecured the honour of his holine&s;s, and &s;how that hatred and abhorrence of &s;in, which his holine&s;s obliges him unto; and yet embrace the Sinner in his Arms of Mercy and Favour? And then again, how could he have &s;ecured the honour of his truth and veracity, when he had &s;o plainly and po&s;itively threatned Death to the Sinner, if he had &s;aved their Souls from Death? Here I &s;ay, lay difficulties beyond the brighte&s;t Angel in Heaven to have cleared up. Who could have found out a way wherein GOD might be merciful to the Sinner, and yet ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and receive full &s;atisfaction for all the wrong done to him by &s;in? Who could have contrived a way wherein he could &s;how infinite love to Sin|ners, and at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame action, manife&s;t an infinite hatred, and abhorrence
<PB N="12" REF="002987_0017_0FE6AF03D07F1D30">
of the &s;in it &s;elf? Who could find out a way where|in GOD might relea&s;e the Sinner from puni&s;h|ment, and yet fully execute the threatning de|nounced again&s;t him? Who could have pitched upon a Method wherein GOD &s;hould exerci&s;e in|finite tenderne&s;s, and compa&s;&s;ionatene&s;s to Sin|ners: and by the &s;ame act fill them with a dread of his Maje&s;ty, and with the mo&s;t convincing apprehen&s;ions of what a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living GOD? The&s;e difficulties lay in the way, when GOD enter|tained thoughts of Mercy concerning us; and &s;urely nothing but Infinite Wi&s;dom could recon|cile the&s;e &s;eeming contradictions: much le&s;s could any thing &s;hort of Infinite Wi&s;dom con|trive a way that would di&s;play all the Divine Perfections: but yet thus it is in the ca&s;e before us. So then,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Wi&s;dom of GOD appears gloriou&s;ly in our Redemption, <HI>if we con&s;ider how fully he has an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed in the Method he has pitched upon for our Redemption.</HI></P>
<P>The End propo&s;ed by GOD (as I hinted before) was not only to maintain the harmony of his per|fections with each other; but to make them all &s;hine the more gloriou&s;ly. And now this end is fully obtained in the method that GOD has taken for it. For in this Work all the Perfections &s;hine with a greater brightne&s;s, and lu&s;tre than ever: herein <HI>mercy and truth not only meet together, and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s each other:</HI> but they are all magnified and become more illu&s;trious. That
<PB N="13" REF="002987_0018_0FE6AF076A0BEA80">
the Mercy and Grace of GOD is magnified, and di&s;played herein, every one mu&s;t acknowledge; who will but ju&s;t con&s;ider what a wretched, mi&s;|erable, and undone condition we were in by rea&s;on of Sin; what infinite provocation we had given to GOD, and how unworthy we were of his favour; and how much co&s;t and pains he has been at to redeem and &s;ave us: and what a glorious and compleat Salvation is wrought out for us. But then not only the Mercy, but the Ju&s;tice of GOD has been greatly magnified, and advanced here|by, as does mo&s;t evidently appear, by GOD's in|&s;i&s;ting upon a full &s;atisfaction for Sin, before ever he would pardon the Sinner: if not from the Per&s;on of the Sinner; yet from a &s;urety, or one in his &s;tead. He in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon a compleat and full &s;atisfaction, that when there was none but his own Son could &s;atisfie the demands of Ju&s;tice; rather than forgive, before the debt was paid to the utmo&s;t farthing, he gave him up to be Sacri|ficed for us. And then again, it is certain that GOD never appeared more glorious in Holine&s;s; than in the Death and Sufferings of Chri&s;t when he was purcha&s;ing Redemption for us. For what could di&s;cover a greater hatred of Sin and Indig|nation again&s;t it, than the putting his only be|gotten, and dearly beloved Son into &s;uch inex|pre&s;&s;ible agonies, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when our iniqui|ties were laid upon him! And to mention no more; as for the Truth &amp; Veracity of the Divine Nature: He that con&s;iders how GOD in&s;i&s;ted up|on the death of our Sub&s;titute, or Surety; (and al&s;o that all Mankind are now brought into a
<PB N="14" REF="002987_0019_0FE6AF0784DBA318">
mortal dying State, and that by an irrever&s;ible, and irre&s;i&s;table decree, it is appointed for all men once to die; cannot but &s;ee, that GOD has had a peculiar regard for the honour of his truth in our Redemption. For altho he redeems and &s;aves &s;ome of the Children of Men from the Condemn|ing Sentence of the Law; yet in effect, yea and to all intents and purpo&s;es, the threatning was executed: but then if to this we add the many promi&s;es he has made in times pa&s;t, concerning Chri&s;t and the Redemption to be wrought out by him, which he has &s;o fully accompli&s;hed; we &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied that GOD has made clear manife&s;tations of <HI>this,</HI> that <HI>he is a GOD of truth and without iniquity,</HI> yea that <HI>it is Impo&s;&s;ible for GOD to lye.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I might go on to all the other per|fections: for they are all di&s;played, and the glory of GOD advanced in every article; by the method of Redemption, GOD has pitched upon. In&s;omuch that the Multitudes of the heavenly Ho&s;t unite in giving glory to Him on that account; Singing as they did upon our Saviour's coming into the world to accompli&s;h this wonderful work, Luke 2.14. <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> Chri&s;t's coming into the world, as it brought <HI>Peace on Earth and &s;hewed good will towards men,</HI> &s;o it brought <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if the manife&s;ting the glory of the Divine Perfections, be the highe&s;t, &amp; the noble&s;t end, that GOD can propo&s;e: and if the obtaining this end in the Redemption of Man was attended with the
<PB N="15" REF="002987_0020_0FE6AF1116520510">
utmo&s;t difficulties; difficulties in&s;uperable to any created rea&s;on: and if GOD notwith&s;tanding the difficulties, has fully accompli&s;hed his end in the method he has pitched upon; then according to the foregoing de&s;cription of Wi&s;dom, it follows that GOD has abounded towards us in all Wi&s;|dom and Prudence; and has proved him&s;elf to be the Infinitely and the only wi&s;e GOD.</P>
<P>This may &s;uffice for a general proof of the Doctrine. But as particular In&s;tances of Contri|vance, in the grand affair of our Redemption, will &s;erve to give a more clear and convincing demon&s;tration of the infinite Wi&s;dom of GOD in this matter; &s;o I propo&s;e, as GOD &s;hall enable and give opportunity, to de&s;cend into &s;everal par|ticular in&s;tances of the manner of GOD's car|rying on the Redemption of Man, and ob&s;erve to you as I go along what Wi&s;dom and Contrivance there was in managing it after &s;uch a particular manner: by taking notice of the Wi&s;e, the Great and the Good Ends that are an&s;wered thereby. But I &s;hall not enter on the&s;e at pre&s;ent; but conclude with a brief</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. What we have heard concerning <HI>Wi&s;dom in general,</HI> may &s;erve to inform us, <HI>Who are the truly wi&s;e Men, and how we must manage our &s;elves, if we would obtain this Character.</HI> Surely they are not the wi&s;e Men, who con|tent them&s;elves with little mean and inferiour views and de&s;igns; altho' they pur&s;ue never

&s;uch proper means to accompli&s;h them. They may e&s;teem them&s;elves wi&s;e, and a fooli&s;h world may call them &s;o, who are prudent and politick in temporal Affairs; who make their worldly intere&s;t the highe&s;t mark they aim at, and pur&s;ue this with utmo&s;t diligence and con|&s;tancy: but now &s;uch worldly wi&s;dom will be found in the conclu&s;ion to be egregious folly. For if we con&s;ider the dignity of our Natures, the &s;uperiour powers and faculties with which they are endowed; we &s;hall be &s;en&s;ible that it is beneath and unworthy &s;uch rational, and im|mortal Souls as ours, to let our views and de|&s;igns terminate in worldly objects; and have our concerns carried no higher than the fading, peri&s;hing enjoyments of this pre&s;ent life. And therefore if we would be ju&s;tly accounted wi&s;e not only in the fight of Men, but in the fight of GOD, who is the be&s;t judge of true Wi&s;dom; we mu&s;t take off our affections from the things here below, and not fix <HI>our eyes upon that which is not.</HI> Our grand concern mu&s;t not be about the world, nor the things of it; but we mu&s;t con&s;ider there are greater things for us to have in view: even the Glory of GOD, and the eternal Salvation of our immortal Souls. The&s;e are the only things worthy to be the chief End, and &s;cope of rational Beings; and as the be&s;t and only way to accompli&s;h the&s;e Ends, is the keeping the Commandments of GOD revealed in his word: &s;o if we would be truly wi&s;e Men, we mu&s;t above every thing el&s;e aim at the glory of GOD, and the ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="17" REF="002987_0022_0FE6AF124858A478">
enjoyment of him. And the&s;e de&s;igns we mu&s;t according to the nature &amp; importance of the things, pro&s;ecute with utmo&s;t &s;peed, di|ligence, and con&s;tancy, by tho&s;e unerring rules laid down in the Oracles of GOD. In &s;hort, we mu&s;t be truly Religious; and then we &s;hall be truly Wi&s;e. Job 28.28. <HI>And unto man he &s;aid, behold the fear of the Lord, that is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What we have heard of the nature of Wi&s;dom may &s;erve to recommend it to us, and quicken us to a more diligent &s;earch after it.</HI> He that con|&s;iders the Nature of true Wi&s;dom, will find it a mo&s;t excellent vertue; greatly, and above all, to be de&s;ired. This is that which inriches, and enobles a Man, and makes him more excellent than his Neighbour. For as rea&s;on rai&s;es a Man above the level of Bea&s;ts: &s;o wi&s;dom rai&s;es one Man above another, makes him really a better Man in the fight of GOD, who is the be&s;t able to judge in &s;uch a matter. This then is what we &s;hould all be ambitious of, and earne&s;tly endeavouring after. Prov. 4.7. <HI>Wi&s;|dom is the principal thing, therefore get wi&s;dom, and with all thy getting get understanding.</HI> And &s;urely, <HI>Happy is the man that findeth wi&s;dom, and the man that getteth under&s;tanding; for the mer|chandize of it is better than the merchandize of &s;ilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold,</HI> Prov. 3.13, 14.</P>
<P>To conclude, There are many u&s;eful and practical Inferences might be drawn from what
<PB N="18" REF="002987_0023_0FE6AF125F2F6DD0">
has been &s;aid of the Wi&s;dom and Prudence of GOD, that has abounded in the work of our Redemption; but I &s;hall leave them to clo&s;e the &s;ubject withal; and &s;hall at pre&s;ent only &s;ay in general: &mdash;</P>
<P>Since GOD, in the affair of our Redemption, has abounded towards us in all Wi&s;dom, and Prudence, <HI>Let us give him the glory of it.</HI> Let us acknowledge, and adore him as the only wi&s;e GOD, who is wonderful in Coun&s;el, and excellent in working. Let us apply our &s;elves to him, as to the fountain of wi&s;dom, for all that wi&s;dom that is profitable, and nece&s;&s;ary to di|rect us in all our ways; agreable to the Exhor|tation, and Encouragement given by the Apo&s;tle, James 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and up-braideth not, and it &s;hall be given him.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, from the infinite Wi&s;dom of GOD appearing in the work of our Redemption; let us be convinced, that every thing is ordered by con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom, and Prudence: and let us accordingly acquie&s;ce, and re&s;t &s;atisfied in all the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence; how dark and unaccountable &s;o ever they may ap|pear to us; believing and realizing <HI>this,</HI> that altho' we can't &s;ee thro' many of GOD's deal|ings and di&s;pen&s;ations to us; yet that <HI>he</HI> does, and that nothing befalls us, but what is the re&s;ult of infinite and unerring Wi&s;dom.

<P>HAving in the former Di&s;cour&s;e, given a general proof of the Doctrine; and &s;hown that GOD in the Method he has taken for the Redemption of Man has abounded towards us in all Wi&s;dom, and Prudence: I propo&s;ed for the more full, clear, and convincing evidence of this truth, to give &s;ome particular Instances in the affair of our Redemption, and &s;how how the Wi&s;|dom of GOD is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nife&s;ted and di&s;played in them; by mentioning &s;ome of the wi&s;e, great, and good Ends that are an&s;wered by them.</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>GOD's refu&s;ing to treat with Man, any other way than by a</HI> MEDIATOR, <HI>was an In|&s;tance of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' GOD entertained thoughts, and purpo&s;es of Mercy concerning us, in our fallen, and un|done E&s;tate; yet he did not &s;ee cau&s;e to deal with us Immediately, and by him&s;elf: but in and by
<PB N="20" REF="002987_0025_0FE6AF1C0E62B188">
a third Per&s;on, or Mediator. Hence the Apo&s;tle tells us, that as there is <HI>one God</HI>: &s;o there is <HI>one Mediator between God and Man,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.5. Since the fall, GOD has not &s;een cau&s;e to reveal his mind, and will, or any way to communicate him|&s;elf to us, but by a Mediator. Nor will he allow us to come into his pre&s;ence; to pay our adorati|ons, or make our addre&s;&s;es unto him, but in and thro' a Mediator that he has appointed for us. Thro' this Mediator only <HI>have we acce&s;s by one Spirit unto the Father,</HI> Eph. 2.18. He does not allow us to come before him in our own Name, to pre&s;ent our Prayers, and Prai&s;es on our own account, and therefore does the Apo&s;tle direct us in Col. 3.17. <HI>Whatever ye do, in word or deed; do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us</HI> (who is the Mediator) <HI>giving thanks to God, and the Father by him.</HI> And our <HI>Spiritual &s;acrifices are accept|able to God, only thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5. And now in this there appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence. Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. This &s;erves to &s;et forth the Infinite purity, and holine&s;s of the Divine Nature.</P>
<P>If GOD (after we had &s;inned again&s;t him, and brought &s;uch a dreadful pollution, and de|filement upon our natures) had given us free li|berty of acce&s;s into his pre&s;ence; without the help, mediation, or interce&s;&s;ion of another: How would he have &s;hown, or manife&s;ted the infinite di&s;tance between him&s;elf, and a &s;inful creature? Would he not by admitting us into his pre&s;ence without a Mediator, have appeared too reconcile|able
<PB N="21" REF="002987_0026_0FE6AF1D3841B7D8">
to Sin &amp; Sinners? Would he not have there|by ob&s;cured the glory of his holine&s;s, and have given &s;ome countenance to Sin? If GOD had al|lowed an immediate intercour&s;e with Sinners; how could it have appeared to Men or Angels that GOD bore an infinite hatred of all Sin, as is declared of him? And therefore GOD to main|tain the honour of his holine&s;s, keeps Man at a di&s;tance from him. Our iniquities had &s;eparated between us, and our GOD, and hid his face from us; and GOD would not &s;uffer us to approach unto him, after that, but thro' a Mediator, that he had appointed, to con&s;ecrate a new, and a living way for us. But he looks upon it as daring pre|&s;umption in any, to offer up either prayers, or prai&s;es to him in their own names: and he rejects such offerings with utmo&s;t dete&s;tation &amp; abhor|ence. By which it plainly appears that he is of <HI>purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</HI> and that <HI>the wicked &s;hall not stand in his fight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>treating with Man only in and by a Mediator, &s;erves for this good purpo&s;e,</HI> viz. <HI>to &s;et forth the greatne&s;s of the Divine Maje&s;ty, &amp; to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls with an holy awe, &amp; reverence of him.</HI></P>
<P>When GOD refu&s;es to have any thing to do with us; or that we &s;hould have any thing to do with him, but by a Mediator, it leads us to this apprehen&s;ion of him, that there is &s;uch infinite Maje&s;ty and Greatne&s;s with him, as cant with any propriety admit &s;uch du&s;t and a&s;hes as we are into his immediate pre&s;ence. When an Earthly
<PB N="22" REF="002987_0027_0FE6AF1D52A25ED8">
Monarch, keeps his Subjects at &s;uch a di&s;tance as not to permit them to come into his pre&s;ence, nor ask to receive any favour from him immediately, but only by the mediation of the Nobility, and the great Men that make his Court; it &s;erves to &s;et forth the grandure of &s;uch a Prince, and rai&s;es the apprehen&s;ions of his Subjects concerning the &s;plendor and greatne&s;s of his Maje&s;ty, and fills them with fear, and trembling at the thoughts of coming into his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Thus the King of Heaven, that we might have &s;uitable apprehen&s;ions of his Maje&s;ty, and his glory, keeps us at a di&s;tance; as he did the Chil|dren of I&s;rael from Mount Sinai, when he de&s;cend|ed upon it, to deliver the Law unto them: and wont &s;uffer our approaches to him, any nearer than by a third Per&s;on, or Mediator: who being GOD as well as Man; is able, and worthy to approach his immediate pre&s;ence, which we are not. And now as hereby GOD plainly teaches us, that he will be wor&s;hipped with reverence, and godly fear, that he will be Sanctified by all them that draw near unto him, and before the people he will be glorified: &s;o it &s;erves to fill us with an holy awe, and reverence towards the infinite Maje&s;ty of Heaven, when ever we are about to wait upon him: which is a mo&s;t wi&s;e contrivance. For it is highly proper that GOD's <HI>excellency &s;hould make us afraid, and his dread fall upon us,</HI> that we &s;hould <HI>&s;erve the Lord with fear&punc; and rejoyce with trembling.</HI></P>

Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;ays of him, <HI>that he dwells in the light which no Man can approach unto: whom no man hath &s;een, nor can &s;ee,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.16. It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to have acce&s;s into the immediate pre&s;ence of the Divine Maje&s;ty without being overcome with &s;uch in|finite Glory.

<P N="2">II. <HI>Another in&s;tance of Divine Wi&s;dom, was GOD's in&s;isting upon a</HI> SATISFACTION <HI>for Sin, in order to his Pardoning, and Saving the Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>By Satisfaction for Sin, we are to under&s;tand &s;omething that will repair the wrong done to GOD by Sin. Now GOD is wronged by Sin as
<PB N="24" REF="002987_0029_0FE6AF2753D2EBB0">
his perfections are practically denied, clouded, and di&s;honored by it: and con&s;equently what|ever is done, or &s;uffered, that will vindicate the divine perfections, and make them appear as bright and glorious, as if we had never Sinned; is what I under&s;tand by <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> And now, That GOD did require a &s;uitable &s;atisfaction for Sin, that is, for the wrong done to him by Sin, appears from this; that GOD has taken care that &s;uch a &s;atisfaction &s;hould be made, and becau&s;e all that are ju&s;tified, and &s;aved from condemna|tion, are &s;aved by vertue of that Satisfaction. GOD determined that <HI>without &s;hedding of blood</HI> to make attonement, <HI>there &s;hould be no remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in,</HI> Heb. 9.22. Accordingly Chri&s;t's &s;hedding his blood, and all the &s;ufferings he underwent, was to make &s;atisfaction for &s;in. And he that will attend the mo&s;t plain, and obvious &s;en&s;e of many places of Scripture, will be convinced of this truth. Thus we are &s;aid to be <HI>bought with a price,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. And we are &s;aid to be <HI>redeemed not with corruptible things, &s;uch as &s;ilver, and gold: but with the precious blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.19. And we are &s;aid to <HI>have redemption thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins, in the ver&s;e</HI> proceeding the Text: which plainly teaches us there was &s;atisfaction made by the blood of Chri&s;t, and that upon the account of <HI>that &s;atisfaction</HI> it is that GOD ever pardons and &s;aves a Sinner. And there are a multitude of other Texts that &s;erve to confirm this point. As where Chri&s;t is &s;aid <HI>to dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for us, to be made &s;in for us, to be made a cur&s;e for us, and to bear our &s;ins in his own body on the
<PB N="25" REF="002987_0030_0FE6AF289CD3CE78">
tree.</HI> But I &s;hall not enter into this controver&s;y with the <HI>Socinians</HI>; who deny the Doctrine of Chri&s;ts Satisfaction: but &s;hall take the thing for granted.</P>
<P>And now behold the Wi&s;dom, and the Prudence of GOD in it! Indeed it is not for us &s;ay ab|&s;olutely, GOD could not have pardoned without a Satisfaction: he might for any thing we can tell; by a &s;overeign act of Grace hare pardoned all the World, and pa&s;&s;ed by the wrong, and di&s;hon|our done to him y Sin. But this we may ven|ture to &s;ay; that it was much the be&s;t that there &s;hould be a &s;uitable price paid for our ran&s;om. For altho' GOD in pardoning without &s;atisfaction might have magnified his goodne&s;s, his mercy, and his grace: Yet it does not appear to us, how the honour of his other perfections could have been &s;ecured, much le&s;s advanced. Nay it &s;eems to us, as if &s;ome reflection would un|avoidably have been ca&s;t upon GOD, if he had not in&s;i&s;ted upon a &s;uitable &s;atisfaction. Would not his &s;potle&s;s purity, and holine&s;s been called in que&s;tion, and a doubt ari&s;en among his Rational Creatures, whether he bore &s;uch an infinite hatred to Sin, as was declared of him? Or would there not have been &s;ome di&s;honourable reflection up|on his Ju&s;tice? For how could we imagine GOD to be ju&s;t to him&s;elf and maintain the rights and prerogatives that belong to him; and yet &s;uffer Sin to go unpuni&s;hed? How could we imagine GOD to be ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and yet &s;uffer his Laws to be violated, and thereby his Authority to be trampled upon, his goodne&s;s abu&s;ed, and all
<PB N="26" REF="002987_0031_0FE6AF28B38CB760">
his perfections implicitly denied; and he demand no &s;atisfaction for it, nor take any other notice of it than to forgive the offender and receive him into favour? But &s;uppo&s;ing GOD &s;hould have e&s;caped any reflection, as to his being unju&s;t to him&s;elf; yet if GOD had pardoned without &s;atisfaction, would it not be &s;aid by &s;ome, as if GOD had not wi&s;ely contrived the Covenant, that he at fir&s;t made with Man; that he had given a hard and unrea&s;onable law, and laid too heavy a yoke upon us, or had threatned too &s;evere a penalty, or had given too great power to the Devil in tempting our fir&s;t Parents; which GOD being now &s;en&s;ible of, forgave them without any Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But then to &s;ay no more: If no di&s;honour &s;hould be reflected on GOD on the&s;e accounts; yet we cannot &s;ee but that he would at lea&s;t be charged with mutability, and changeablene&s;s of mind. For GOD having po&s;itively threatned Death, in ca&s;e of &s;in, and di&s;obedience, what le&s;s could be &s;aid but that he had altered his mind, if he had pa&s;&s;ed by their &s;in without having Death &s;uffered either by them&s;elves, or by their &s;urety, and even this would have been no &s;mall di&s;honour to GOD: for this is one of the glories of the Divine Nature, that <HI>he is not a man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent,</HI> Numb. 23.19. <HI>He is of one mind, and none can turn him,</HI> Job 25.13. <HI>And he is Lord that changes not.</HI> Mal. 3.6. All which being laid to|gether makes it appear how highly proper&punc; if not nece&s;&s;ary, it was, for GOD to in&s;i&s;t upon a Satis|faction
<PB N="27" REF="002987_0032_0FE6AF2F236DE688">
for Sin; before he pardons it. And this al&s;o &s;hows the infinite Wi&s;dom of GOD, that altho' he was infinite in Mercy, and ready to pardon; yet at the &s;ame time took care, that Mercy &s;hould not prevail to the damage of any other Perfections. For GOD by demanding a Satisfaction for Sin has wi&s;ely, and impartially con&s;ulted the honour of all his attributes. For by demanding Satisfaction for Sin, he remains as holy, and as ju&s;t as ever, even in the eyes of all his Creatures. By this, al&s;o he &s;tands by his own Laws, that he gave to Man at fir&s;t, and a&s;&s;erts the holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s of them, and that nothing hard or unrea&s;onable was im|po&s;ed upon us. Moreover by this he &s;hows him|&s;elf to be immutable; that there is not the lea&s;t variablene&s;s, nor &s;haddow of turning, but that he is always of one mind, by this it appears that he has the &s;ame regard for his own honour as ever, that he has the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of Sin and of his Laws that ever he had.</P>
<P>And then la&s;tly, altho' at fir&s;t view, it may &s;eem that there is no great Mercy, or Grace ex|erci&s;ed in the pardoning Sinners; when there has been a full, and compleat Satisfaction made for all the wrong done by their Sin: Yet if we con&s;ider that GOD might have refu&s;ed any but a Per&s;onal Satisfaction, and in&s;i&s;ted upon that rule, <HI>that the Soul that &s;ins &s;hall die</HI>; it appears to be an act of Grace to accept of the Satisfaction made by a &s;urety. And if we do but con&s;ider who the Surety was and by whom the Satisfaction for Sin was made; the glory of
<PB N="28" REF="002987_0033_0FE6AF2F372101B0">
divine grace and mercy will in this way &s;hine as bright as any of the Divine Perfections.</P>
<P>Which leads me to the third In&s;tance.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>GOD's appointing the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>his only begotten</HI> SON <HI>to be the Mediator, to undertake the work of our Redemp|tion; was another in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, &amp; Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>We may &s;uppo&s;e a grand Council held by the Sacred THREE that bear record in Heaven; to pitch upon a proper Per&s;on to undertake the Salvation of Men, and to be a Mediator between us. And here we may &s;uppo&s;e the Father &s;aying, as in I&s;aiah 6.8. <HI>Whom &s;hall I &s;end, and who will go for us</HI>? To which we may &s;uppo&s;e the Son to reply in the following words, <HI>Here am I, &s;end me.</HI> And this was agreed and con&s;ented to: accordingly he was &s;ent into the World to a&s;&s;ume our Nature into per&s;onal union with his Divine Nature. Hence we read John 1.14. <HI>that the word,</HI> that is the Eternal Word, <HI>the word that was with God and the word that was God and by whom all things were made, was made fle&s;h and dwelt among us.</HI> And now Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth</HI> the Son of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was the very per&s;on. For he was once &amp; again declared by an audible voice from Heaven, to be the beloved Son of GOD. And that Per&s;on is expre&s;sly declared to be the Mediator between GOD, and us, 1 Tim. 2.5. <HI>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Now GOD's ap|pointing his own Son, to be the Mediator was an
<PB N="29" REF="002987_0034_0FE6AF33CDFA5E80">
in&s;tance of con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom. And that for this rea&s;on in general; becau&s;e he was the mo&s;t proper, and &s;uitable per&s;on that could be for this Office. It is certainly an in&s;tance of prudence to chu&s;e the mo&s;t proper per&s;on for any &s;ervice: and herein appears the Wi&s;dom of GOD. For the per&s;on he has con&s;tituted, and appointed to be Mediator, is the mo&s;t proper per&s;on that could be for that Office.</P>
<P>And this will appear if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. Some of the <HI>Qualifications</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for a Mediator.</P>
<P N="2">2. How peculiarly the&s;e Qualifications centred in the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the Son of GOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us con&s;ider &s;ame of the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifi|cations of a Mediator.</HI></P>
<P>Now, by nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications; I mean &s;uch as will capacitate, and enable a per&s;on fully, and in the be&s;t manner to an&s;wer the ends of the Office; &s;uch Qualifications as will enable him not only to keep up the harmony but to advance the Glory of all the Divine Perfections, in the Salvaion, and recovery of fallen Man.</P>
<P>And here it may be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. One Qualification nece&s;&s;ary for a Mediator is, that he &s;hould be <HI>cho&s;en and approved of GOD.</HI> For as GOD might have in&s;i&s;ted upon a per&s;onal Satisfaction from us, and might have refu&s;ed whatever &s;hould be offered by another, even altho' it was in it &s;elf equivalent; &s;o it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary he &s;hould have the choice, &amp; approbation of the per&s;on who&s;e &s;acrifice, and offering he would accept on our account.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="002987_0035_0FE6AF33E43C65D0">2. Another nece&s;&s;ary Qualification for a Me|diator is, that <HI>he &s;hould be perfectly pure, and holy: free from all manner of Sin, and Guilt of his own.</HI></P>
<P>For if a Mediator &s;hould have any Sin of his own, that would be enough and more than he could &s;atisfie for; and con&s;equently his Sufferings how &s;evere &s;oever, could be of no avail for the Sins of others.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is further requi&s;ite for a Mediator, <HI>that he be one that was not under a previous obligation to the law, he is to obey in this &s;tead of others.</HI></P>
<P>For if he &s;hould have been under obligations to fulfill the Law before his undertaking the Me|diator&s;hip, his obedience to the law would be only doing his duty: and &s;o could have no merit in it for others. His obedience could not have been a meritorious obedience and &s;o could not have been imputed to us for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another nece&s;&s;ary Qualification of a Me|diator is, that <HI>he &s;hould be very near and dear to GOD, greatly beloved of him.</HI></P>
<P>It was very nece&s;&s;ary for the illu&s;trating the Divine Perfections in the work of our Redemp|tion. Thus it was nece&s;&s;ary that the Mediator &s;hould be the beloved of GOD's Soul, to manife&s;t his holine&s;s, and hatred of Sin in puni&s;hing him, when our iniquities were laid upon him: for if it was one that GOD had no particular regard for, it would not appear &s;o clearly, when he &s;hould be under the Divine Wrath, that it was all for Sins imputed to him. It might look as if GOD pun|i&s;hed him &s;o &s;everely more for want of love to him, than thro' hatred of Sin. Moreover impartial,
<PB N="31" REF="002987_0036_0FE6AF3DE34E40F8">
and inflexible Ju&s;tice appears more con&s;picuous in inflicting the full de&s;ert of Sin upon him that is dearly beloved, and for whom we have the mo&s;t tender regards, than on one that we have little or no affection for. And then again, it was very nece&s;&s;ary for the manife&s;tation of Di|vine Grace that the per&s;on whom GOD gives to be a Mediator to die, and &s;uffer for us, &s;hould be infinitely dear unto him. For if it had been one that GOD had little or no regard for; there would not appear any great mea&s;ure of Love, in giving him for us: but the nearer and dearer the per&s;on is to GOD, that he gives to redeem and &s;ave us, the more clearly would hiss love &amp; grace be manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>Moreover, it was nece&s;&s;ary the Mediator &s;hould be very near and dear to GOD, for the comfort and encouragement of &s;uch: that they might be well a&s;&s;ured of his intere&s;t with GOD, of the pre|valency of his Interce&s;&s;ions, and of their per&s;ons and performances being accepted <HI>in the Beloved.</HI> Surely when the Saints con&s;ider that the Mediator is one in whom GOD is ever well plea&s;ed, it will encourage their hopes, and &s;trengthen their faith in him, and they mu&s;t look upon them&s;elves as &s;afe and &s;ecure with him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Qualification requi&s;ite for a Me|diator <HI>is that he &s;hould partake of both Natures, between which he Mediates: that is, that he &s;hould be both GOD, and Man.</HI></P>
<P>That the Mediator &s;hould partake of both Na|tures, &s;eems very nece&s;&s;ary; &s;eeing he was to un|dertake for both parties. He was as a days man
<PB N="32" REF="002987_0037_0FE6AF3DF71B7F88">
to lay his hand upon us both: and by partaking of both natures; he mu&s;t needs have an impartial regard for each.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary the Mediator &s;hould be GOD to give vertue, and value to his &s;ufferings. For nothing le&s;s than the &s;ufferings of him, who is truly GOD can give &s;uch demon&s;trations of in|finite ju&s;tice, and holine&s;s, as to &s;ecure the honour of the&s;e perfections in the Salvation of Sinful Man.</P>
<P>Moreover, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mediator was &s;uch as required nothing le&s;s than the Wi&s;dom and the Power of GOD to accompli&s;h it. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mediator is to convert, &amp; change the hearts of Sinners, to &s;ubdue, and conquer their enemies for them, even <HI>principalities, and powers, and the ruler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the darkne&s;s of this world</HI>: to overrule all things in providence for the good of the Redeemed: his bu&s;ine&s;s is like|wi&s;e to di&s;cern and ob&s;erve the motions of Mens Hearts, as well as their outward carriage, and to judge the &s;ecrets of Men. Now the&s;e things re|quire that Wi&s;dom and Power that dont belong to any Creature, but are Divine Prerogatives. Surely nothing le&s;s than the <HI>Wonderful Coun&s;el|our, and the mighty God</HI> could <HI>perform all the&s;e things for us.</HI></P>
<P>But then it was as nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o that the Me|diator &s;hould be <HI>Man,</HI> and that in order to his be|ing capacitated to &s;uffer for Sin at all; or at lea&s;t in order to his Suffering in the &s;ame Nature that offended&punc; which mu&s;t be thought highly rea&s;on|able, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: for if he had
<PB N="33" REF="002987_0038_0FE6AF3F13F6DAE8">
taken any other than the humane nature, the fallen Angels might have laid claim to the merit of his Sufferings as &s;oon as we, but &s;eeing he took not on him the nature of Angels; but the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham</HI>; it gives the mo&s;t comfortable a&s;&s;urances, that his undertaking is on our account, and that he is our Mediator, and Saviour. And then as he was to teach men the way to Salva|tion by his Doctrine, and by his Example; &s;o upon the&s;e accounts it was mo&s;t rea&s;onable, yea very nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould take upon him our nature, <HI>be made fle&s;h and dwell among us.</HI> And as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>in all things,</HI> upon all ac|counts, <HI>it behoved him</HI> that was to be the Media|tor, <HI>that he &s;hould be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a merciful, and faithful high Prie&s;t in things pertaining to God, to make re|conciliation for the &s;in of the people.</HI></P>
<P>Now the&s;e are &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tions for a Mediator.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us con&s;ider <HI>how peculiarly Chri&s;t the Son of God was thus Qualified</HI> for this Office; which will &s;how the Wi&s;dom and Prudence of GOD, in making choice of him for that &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And here it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that there was no per&s;on in Heaven, or Earth that was &s;o eminent|ly, and peculiarly Qualified for it, as he was. For as he was the per&s;on that GOD <HI>Cho&s;e,</HI> ap|proved, and accepted of; &s;o had he all other ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualifications. Thus he was perfectly <HI>pure</HI> and holy: it is &s;aid of him that <HI>he knew no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.22. <HI>And he was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, &s;epa|rate
<PB N="34" REF="002987_0039_0FE6AF3F2ACB94E8">
from &s;inners,</HI> Heb. 7.26. He was free not only from all actual &s;in, but from all natural corruption: for altho' he was born of a Woman; yet his Conception was in &s;uch a way, as to e&s;cape the natural pollution; (the wi&s;dom of which may hereafter be con&s;idered) by which means he had nothing of his own to an&s;wer for, and therefore all his Sufferings mu&s;t be purely on our account.</P>
<P>Moreover, con&s;ider him <HI>as GOD,</HI> and he was under no previous obligation to obey the Law of GOD given to Man. For altho' there was an exact conformity to the&s;e Laws in the Divine Mind, they being all holy, ju&s;t and good, yet it had not the nature of obedience: for obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ctly &s;peaking, is a &s;ubjection to a law from the Authority of the Lawgiver. But now in this &s;ence, Chri&s;t as he was GOD was under no obli|gation to obedience; for he was the Lawgiver him&s;elf, and was &s;ubject to no Superiour Autho|rity; and therefore for him to put him&s;elf into &s;uch a &s;tate, wherein he might yeild obedience to the Law, as it was an act of Infinite conde&s;cention in him; &s;o there mu&s;t needs be infinite merit in &s;uch obedience.</P>
<P>And further he had this peculiar Qualification that he partook of both natures; he was both GOD, and Man, as is mo&s;t frequently, and fully declared of him, in the word of GOD, where he is called, <HI>the great God, and our Saviour,</HI> Tit 2.13. And <HI>the only wi&s;e God,</HI> Jude 25. Where al&s;o all Divine attributes are a&s;cribed to him: and all Divine homage and adoration directed to be paid
<PB N="35" REF="002987_0040_0FE6AF4794A07CB0">
to him. And we are al&s;o a&s;&s;ured from the &s;ame Infallible Oracles, that the Eternal Word was made fle&s;h, <HI>John</HI> 1.14. And that he who is the Mediator between GOD and us, is the <HI>Man</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And then again, as another nece&s;&s;ary Qualifi|cation of a Mediator was that he &s;hould be one very <HI>near and dear</HI> to GOD; &s;o none on this ac|count was ever qualified to &s;uch an high degree as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for he was infinitely near and dear unto GOD. Who can be &s;o dear to him as his only begotten Son? He once &amp; again declared him to be <HI>his beloved Son, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om he was well plea&s;ed.</HI> As at his Bapti&s;m; and Tran&s;|figuration, <HI>Matt.</HI> 3. &mdash; 17. And he is em|phatically called, THE BELOVED, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. Intimating to us that he is beloved above all others: on which account there was no per&s;on in whom GOD could have manife&s;ted his impartial Ju&s;tice, his infinite hatred of Sin, and yet at the &s;ame time his infinite love to Sinners, as in the per&s;on of his Son. Nay it may be &s;aid in that the Son of GOD &s;eems to be the mo&s;t proper of the Sacred THREE in the glorious Godhead. It does not &s;eem as if infinite holine&s;s, and ju&s;tice, infinite love, and grace would have appeared &s;o con&s;picuous, if any other per&s;on in the Trinity had undertaken this work. And &s;o the Wi&s;dom of GOD appears in pitching on this very per&s;on in particular, and not on the Father, or the Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Spirit: and this would appear with re&s;pect to the Father in particular, if we might venture to form any notion of the matter, from the Relation of a
<PB N="36" REF="002987_0041_0FE6AF47A86D6550">
Father and a Son among Men. Now affection more naturally de&s;cends from Parents to Children; than a&s;cends from Children to Parents. And therefore the highe&s;t, and &s;tronge&s;t affection, we can imagine among Men, is that of a Father to a Son, e&s;pecially to an only Son: and con&s;equent|ly a Man could not give a better manife&s;tation of his impartiality, and ju&s;tice; than in puni&s;h|ing &s;uch a Son according to the demerit of any Crimes he may be guilty of; and not &s;pare him at all, thro' natural affection: nor could a Man &s;how greater love, and kindne&s;s to another than in giving up &s;uch a Son for his &s;ake, or than for &s;uch a Son to be willing to be given up. I &s;ay, con&s;idering the cour&s;e of natural affections, this appears to be a greater thing, than for a Son to deal &s;o by a Father. And now the Son of GOD is infinitely nearer, and dearer to him than a fir&s;t born or an only Son. And con&s;equently it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to conceive of &s;o high an in&s;tance of impartial ju&s;tice, and infinite holine&s;s; as GOD's puni&s;hing his Son &s;o &s;everely, when our iniquities were laid upon him: nor of &s;o high an in&s;tants of love as when he gave this his Son to die for us, or when this Son con&s;ented to give him&s;elf for us; to leave the bo&s;om of his, Father, to be made fle&s;h, and dwell among us. And hence our Saviour tells us, John 3.16. That <HI>God &s;o loved the world that he gave his</HI> ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. And now &s;ince GOD's de&s;ign was to magnifie, and illu&s;trate his ju&s;tice, his holine&s;s, and his grace, we cannot but &s;ee and admire the Wi&s;dom and Contrivance, in the very

<P>There are many more in&s;tances of Wi&s;dom, in managing this affair of our Redemption: but I mu&s;t leave them to another opportunity.</P>
<P>And now in a word: let us admire, and adore the Wi&s;dom of GOD; that does thus far di&s;cover it &s;elf in this grand affair. Let us &s;ee and ac|knowledge the Divine prudence in refu&s;ing to treat with Sinners any other way than by a Me|diator; in demanding, and receiving full &s;ati&s;|faction for Sin before he would pardon and &s;ave the Sinner, and e&s;pecially in making choice of his own Son, for our Mediator, and Saviour, &s;o eminently, and peculiarly qualified for the office: who is able to maintain, yea and advance the honour of all the Divine perfections; even when he &s;aves to the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto GOD by him. And now &s;ince the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Mediator, that GOD in his infinite Wi&s;dom has appointed for us; let us believe him to be the mo&s;t proper per&s;on for that Office; and let us te&s;tifie our con&s;ent to it by accepting, &amp; imbrace|ing him with all our hearts, as our Mediator, and Saviour. Let us receive him in all his Media|torial Offices; as the Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King of our Salvation. Let us commit the whole affair of our Salvation to him, looking upon him as able, and al&s;ufficient. Let us depend upon him for righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;trength, and for eternal life; and for every thing that may &s;it and qualifie us

<P>THE point before us is to prove the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the Redemption of fallen Man.

<P N="4"><PB N="39" REF="002987_0044_0FE6AF53216B9678">IV. <HI>The manner of GOD's promi&s;ing, and publi&s;hing the</HI> NEWS <HI>of a Saviour to fallen Man, di&s;covers a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD publi&s;hed his gracious purpo&s;es to &s;ave Man, appears from the many prophe&s;ies, and promi&s;es of a Saviour recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, many ages before he appeared unto us. Thus Man had no &s;ooner Sinned, and ruined him&s;elf, but GOD promi&s;ed a Saviour to him, in Gen. 3 15. <HI>That the &s;eed of the Woman &s;hould break the Serpents head.</HI> Which altho' it may &s;eem a dark and ob&s;cure promi&s;e to us, at this day; yet doubtle&s;s they under&s;tood more by it, than we could po&s;&s;ibly have gathered from the words; had we not received the fulfillment of the promi&s;e, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the interpretation. And now this was the promi&s;e, or the Go&s;pel, which the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Patriarchs lived upon; and were ju&s;tified by their faith in it. But then afterwards, when thro' di&s;tance of time, the pro|mi&s;e grew more dark perhaps, and unintelligible to them or at lea&s;t when they began to doubt, and be di&s;couraged, becau&s;e of the delay of the fulfillment of it; then GOD renewed the promi&s;e with con&s;iderable additions, to <HI>Abraham</HI>; reveal|ing to him, that the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or Saviour &s;hould be of his &s;eed, and that in him &s;hould <HI>all the Fami|lies of the Earth be ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> Gen. 12.3. And then he went on further; and declared to <HI>Jacob,</HI> of which of his Sons, he &s;hould come, even of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and not only declared of what tribe he &s;hould de&s;cend; but al&s;o gave a certain
<PB N="40" REF="002987_0045_0FE6AF53353E2080">
<HI>period</HI> of time: before which he &s;hould come, <HI>viz</HI> before the <HI>Scepter</HI> entirely <HI>departed from Judah, or the lawgiver from between his feet,</HI> Gen. 49 10. And then GOD went on gradually as he found there was occa&s;ion for it to make further di&s;coveries of the Me&s;&s;iah; as to inform of what particular Family, or Lineage he was to come; and al&s;o of the Miraculous Circum|&s;tances of his Birth, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 7.14. &mdash; 9.6, 7. And a multitude of particular circum&s;tances re|lating to his Life, and Death were prophe&s;ied of him; as that he &s;hould be a <HI>Man of &s;orrow, and acquainted with grief; that he &s;hould be wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &amp; brui&s;ed for our iniquities, and at la&s;t pour out his Soul unto death.</HI> And much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 53<HI>d.</HI> Chapter, which is &s;o very expre&s;s, and particular that it &s;eems to be rather an Hi&s;tory than a Pro|phe&s;y of tho&s;e times. And then as the time drew nearer; GOD proceeded to reveal the par|ticular time when the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould appear to the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 9.24. <HI>Seventy weeks,</HI> that is prophetical weeks, which make four hundred, and ninety years, <HI>are determined unto thy people, to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &amp; make an end of &s;in, and to make reconciliation for in|iquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to &s;eal up the vi&s;ion, and prophe&s;y, and to anoint the most holy.</HI></P>
<P>But then, be&s;ides a multitude of promi&s;es, and prophecies concerning Chri&s;t, in almo&s;t every age of the Church; there were certain <HI>Ceremonies</HI> in&s;tituted, and app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inted by GOD; to typify, and
<PB N="41" REF="002987_0046_0FE6AF5451095018">
keep up a lively &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t to their minds: and lead them to a fre|quent thought, and con&s;ideration of him, and of the promi&s;es, and prophecies relating to him.</P>
<P>Thus, altho' we have no expre&s;s mention of GOD's appointing <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> immediately after the fall; yet we have abundant rea&s;on to think he did; from their coming &s;o early into the practice of it: and e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that GOD had re&s;pect unto their offerings; when they were made with &s;uitable di&s;po&s;itions of mind: as it is &s;aid he had to the offerings of <HI>Abel,</HI> Gen. 4.4. which we can't &s;uppo&s;e he would, unle&s;s he had in&s;tituted, and appointed &s;uch Sacrifices to be offered to him. But then afterwards, we find them expre&s;sly commanded; and what a va&s;t variety of them was in&s;tituted under the Law; for the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who were then the on|ly vi&s;ible Church, that GOD had in the World. And now the&s;e Sacrifices could not be appointed, from any virtue, or merit in them&s;elves, to make atonement for Sin: for they were utterly in|&s;ufficient for this. The Apo&s;tle tells us, Heb. 10.4. <HI>It was not po&s;&s;ible for the blood of bulls, and of goats, to take away &s;in.</HI> And they them&s;elves were &s;en&s;ible of this: e&s;pecially the wi&s;er and more under&s;tanding part of them. As appears from what the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>Mich.</HI> 6.6, 7. <HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord, and bow my &s;elf before the high God? &s;hall I come before him with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old? will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou&s;ands of Rams, or with ten thou&s;and of rivers of oyl? &s;hall I
<PB N="42" REF="002987_0047_0FE6AF5467403BA8">
give my fir&s;t born for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul</HI>? Which inter|rogations plainly intimate, that the&s;e Sacrifices altho' never &s;o many, and co&s;tly, could not make atonement for Sin; and con&s;equently were only typical of the great Sacrifice Chri&s;t was to make of him&s;elf, once at the end of the World, to take away Sin. And the de&s;ign of them was, no doubt, to keep up a thought of Chri&s;t in their minds, and to lead them to a dependance upon him alone for Pardon, and Salvation. And altho the thoughts of the common and more ignorant peo|ple might terminate with the Sacrifices before them: yet it cant be thought but that the wi&s;er of them, had their thought, and their dependance, upon a more perfect Sacrifice.</P>
<P>And now GOD in the&s;e promi&s;es, prophecies, and typical repre&s;entations; that he made of Chri&s;t before his coming, has manife&s;ted a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence; in as much as many great, and good ends, have been an&s;wered by them. The&s;e things have been very much for the glory of GOD, and of great &s;ervice, and benefit to Mankind.</P>

to him, con&s;idering not only the matter of the promi&s;e it &s;elf, but al&s;o the time and &s;ea&s;on in which it was made! Our fir&s;t Parents having acted &s;o contrary to the po&s;itive prohibition, that GOD had given them, and therein abu&s;ed his Goodne&s;s, as well as rebelled again&s;t his Sovereign Authority: They could expect nothing but that GOD's Anger &s;hould wax hot again&s;t them, and that he &s;hould Immediately proceed to pronounce, and then execute the Sentence of death upon them. But behold that which they thought would have been the day of vengeance, became <HI>a time of love.</HI> And the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, in&s;tead of executing vengeance upon them, meditated mercy for them, and promi&s;ed the &s;ame unto them. And now, how could GOD have manife&s;t|ed his grace to our fir&s;t Parents more illu&s;triou&s;ly; than when he had called them forth, after they had thro' &s;hame, and guilt endeavoured to flee from his pre&s;ence: and when they &s;tood trembling before him, expecting every moment to have the dreadful Sentence pa&s;&s;ed and executed on them; to have at that very juncture the promi&s;e of a Saviour made unto them! Surely that mu&s;t needs fill their hearts with the highe&s;t admira|tions of his infinite grace. And altho' GOD did proceed to denounce the Sentence of Death for their Sin, and did actually turn them out of Paradi&s;e: yet how gracious did he appear when he gave them the promi&s;e of a Saviour before hand, to be a cordial to &s;upport and comfort them? How wonderful did his grace appear, that before he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t them of their earthly Paradi&s;e,

he gave them the comfortable hopes &amp; pro&s;pects of an Heavenly one! But then as that fir&s;t pro|mi&s;e was a wonderful manife&s;tation of grace, and mercy to <HI>Men</HI>: &s;o was it a &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;covery of divine grace to all the <HI>Angels in Heaven.</HI> They had &s;ome time before, &s;een their fellow Creatures that rebelled, actually turned out of Heaven; without any promi&s;e or pro&s;pect of Mercy. But now to hear GOD making a promi&s;e of a Saviour to fallen Man; mu&s;t needs fill them with Sur|pri&s;e and Wonder at the Sovereign di&s;tinction of Divine Grace: and in&s;tead of the lea&s;t murmur again&s;t GOD for pa&s;&s;ing by their Brethren that fell, or envious thought at Men, whom GOD thus di&s;tingui&s;hed by his grace, they were filled with raptures of joy at the unexpected manife&s;t|ation of grace and mercy, and no doubt broke forth in Songs of prai&s;e, as they did when the Saviour, the mercy promi&s;ed, actually appeared, Luke 2.14. <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, good will towards men!</HI></P>
<P>And now as the fir&s;t promi&s;e, being thus con|trived, with regard to the Time of it, was a &s;urpri|zing manife&s;tation of Grace to all the rational Creation: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ll the other promi&s;es that follow'd, relating to Chri&s;t, &s;erved very much to illu&s;trate the Grace of GOD.

<P>Indeed there &s;eems to be no other way, or at lea&s;t no &s;uch effectual method, for GOD to manife&s;t the infinite truth, and veracity of his nature, as by foretelling things to come, and then by bringing them to pa&s;s exactly as he foretold them. And thus GOD to manife&s;t the glory of his truth, for many ages and generations before hand promi&s;ed a Saviour, and foretold by the mouth of his Prophets, many particular in&s;tances relating to his coming. And now all tho&s;e being accompli&s;hed to a tittle when he came, it gives a clear demon&s;tration (to all, that have ever read the Prophecy, and the Hi&s;|tory) of the infinite truth, and faithfulne&s;s of GOD, it plainly &s;hows that he is not <HI>a man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould re|pent:</HI> but that when he has &s;aid, he will cer|tainly do it, and <HI>that heaven, and earth &s;hall &s;ooner pa&s;s away, than one word that he hath pro|mi&s;ed, or foretold.</HI></P>

<P>GOD's promi&s;ing the &s;eed of the Woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be the Saviour of the World; and his foretell|ing &s;o many remarkable circum&s;tances relating to his Birth, his Life, and Death, many hun|dreds, nay thou&s;ands of years before hand; and every thing coming to pa&s;s exactly as he fore|told them; this plainly demon&s;trates that he knows things future, &amp; at a di&s;tance as well as tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent. And then he that has this pre&s;cience, or knowledge of things future in &amp; of him&s;elf, mu&s;t needs have the ab&s;olute government of all things in his hands.

It was therefore agreed upon in the infinite Councils of GOD; that the Son of GOD or the Eternal <HI>Word &s;hould be made fle&s;h and dwell among us,</HI> which was ac|cordingly accompli&s;hed; as we find, <HI>John</HI> 1.14.</P>
<P>But now altho' he a&s;&s;umed the Humane Na|ture; yet it was not in the common, and natural cour&s;e, by ordinary generation. For he was conceived by the power of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>: without having any natural Father after the fle&s;h. A particular ac|count
<PB N="51" REF="002987_0056_0FE6AF6F6F9CE378">
of this miraculous conception we have in <HI>Luke</HI> 1.31, 34, 35. The Angel being &s;ent to the Virgin, <HI>&s;ays to her, Behold thou &s;halt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a &s;on, and &s;halt call his name Je&s;us</HI>: to which &s;he replies, <HI>How &s;hall this be, &s;eeing I know not a man</HI>? To which the Angel an&s;wers: <HI>The holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the power of the highe&s;t &s;hall over&s;hadow thee.</HI> And &s;o in&s;tead of being with Child by any man, &s;he was as the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew</HI> declares <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.18. <HI>With Child by the holy Ghost.</HI> And now the Wi&s;dom and the Prudence of GOD ap|pears in this. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By this action he has manifested the glory of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certainly a miracle, and altogether beyond the power of nature, for a <HI>Virgin</HI> to con|ceive: and nothing le&s;s than the power of that GOD, that is above nature, could accompli&s;h it And now this almighty power has GOD made known in the conception, and birth of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. By this GOD makes it plainly appear to all his Creatures, that he can <HI>do whatever he plea&s;es, and that nothing is too hard for him.</HI> By this he lets us know, that by his almighty Spirit he can work in and upon us, according to his good plea&s;ure; that he can convert and change our hearts; which is beyond the power of nature, and cau&s;e us to be born again of the Spirit. And as he prepared the womb of the Virgin for the reception of the Son of GOD, &s;o he can prepare a room in our hearts for him, and &s;et <HI>open the everla&s;ting doors of our Souls for this king of glory
<PB N="52" REF="002987_0057_0FE6AF6F87CAC810">
to come in,</HI> and make us <HI>the habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t's a&s;&s;umption of the Humane Nature in &s;uch a miraculous manner, was an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, <HI>as it appears to us, the only way to e&s;cape the Taint of Original Sin.</HI></P>
<P>If he had been begotten after the ordinary way, the guilt &amp; the corruption of our fir&s;t Parents would have de&s;cended to him; as much as to the re&s;t of their Po&s;terity. Therefore GOD, to pre|vent this, took care that he &s;hould be conceived in another manner, whereby he &s;hould wholly e&s;cape the pollution that cleaves to all the natural de&s;cendants of <HI>Adam</HI>: and by the manner of his conception he did entirely e&s;cape. Hence the Angel calls him <HI>that holy thing which &s;hould be born,</HI> Luke 1.35. And now the taking effectual care for his e&s;caping the guilt and pollution, that was natural to man, was an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom and Prudence, Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. Hereby the <HI>Divine Holine&s;s</HI> was made very con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>For by this GOD plainly &s;hows, that rather than his Son, in taking our nature, &s;hould be tainted with our corruption, he would prepare a body in a miraculous manner for him. By which it plainly appears that GOD will have nothing to do with Sin, but only to puni&s;h it: that he will keep it at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from him&s;elf: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat altho' he was willing to conde&s;cend &s;o far, that his Son &s;hould take our nature upon him with its natural infirmities; yet Sin mu&s;t by all means be excepted; and that he could have to do
<PB N="53" REF="002987_0058_0FE6AF74ED5A8CC8">
with any thing but Sin. Surely by this it plainly appears that he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and that it is the abominable thing that his Soul hates.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereby Je&s;us Chri&s;t was (in this re&s;pect) <HI>qualified to be a Mediator</HI>; which he could not have been, had he been guilty of Original Sin.</P>
<P>Perfect holine&s;s was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a Mediator: and therefore if Chri&s;t had been under the guilt of original Sin, he would have been ut|terly unqualified for his office. He would then have had his own &s;in to an&s;wer for; and &s;o could not have made &s;atisfaction for our Sins; nor could he ever have appeared in the pre&s;ence of an holy GOD for us; nor could he have wrought out a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s to cloath &amp; cover us withall: and &s;o indeed the whole affair of our Redemption by him would have been fru&s;trated, and come to nothing. Now GOD wi&s;ely con&s;idered this matter, and &s;o &s;ent him into the World in &s;uch a manner as to have no Sin of his own; but to be perfectly pure, and holy: which abundantly accompli&s;hed him for the office of a Mediator, and rendered his &s;ufferings infinitely meritorious for the pardon, and ju&s;tification of every Sinner, that repents and believes in him. Thus much may &s;uffice for the fifth In&s;tance.</P>
<P N="4">VI. <HI>GOD's &s;ending his Son into the World at that</HI> PARTICULAR TIME <HI>and</HI> SEASON, <HI>to purcha&s;e Redemption for us,</HI> was another In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>Altho' GOD promi&s;ed a Saviour to our fir&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="002987_0059_0FE6AF7507645198">
Parents, quickly after they had de&s;troyed them|&s;elves, yet he did not pre&s;ently appear to them. And altho' they, and all the Saints of old, were ju&s;tified, and &s;aved by vertue of what he has un|dergone and &s;uffered in our &s;tead, yet he did not make his per&s;onal appearance in the World to offer up him&s;elf a Sacrifice for Sin, till about four thou&s;and years after the fall of Man: and then as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Gal. 4.4. <HI>In the full|ne&s;s of time God &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.</HI></P>
<P>And now in this appeared the Wi&s;dom of GOD. For as there is a great deal of Wi&s;dom in timing a matter well, and doing it in the fitte&s;t, and mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on: &s;o this Wi&s;dom appears in <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> coming into the World at that particular time in which he came. For it was the fitte&s;t time, the be&s;t time that could be; no time &s;o pro|per, and &s;uitable as that particular &s;ea&s;on in which he appeared. No other time whether &s;ooner or later would have an&s;wered the end &s;o well.</P>
<P>Thus for In&s;tance, Suppo&s;ing he &s;hould have come quickly after the fall of Man; and the fir&s;t born of <HI>Eve</HI> &s;hould have been the promi&s;ed &s;eed, (as &s;he her &s;elf imagined when &s;he &s;aid upon the birth of <HI>Cain</HI> &s;he <HI>had gotten a man from the Lord,</HI> Gen 4.1. or <HI>a man the Lord,</HI> as the words properly &s;ignify, <HI>i. e.</HI> God-man, or the Me&s;&s;ias, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Pool</HI>) I &s;ay &s;uppo&s;ing this, yet it would not have an&s;wered the end &s;o well: becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There could not have been tho&s;e particular de&s;criptions of him, in prophecies, and promi&s;es, types and &s;hadows as now there are:</HI> and &s;o one
<PB N="55" REF="002987_0060_0FE6AF7D287744A8">
of the be&s;t arguments we now have for the prov|ing him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, the cho&s;en of GOD, would have been wanting. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There would have been only our fir&s;t Parents to hear his Doctrines, &amp; to atte&s;t unto his miracles</HI>: which would have been a very &s;lender evidence for matters of &s;uch importance, matters of fact, upon the truth of which our Religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>One good Argument that the miracles Chri&s;t wrought (for the confirmation of his Doctrines) were real and no delu&s;ion, is that they were not done <HI>in a Corner,</HI> but in the &s;ight of Multitudes, who as they were able to atte&s;t to the truth of them, &s;o they were able to di&s;cover it, if there had been any cheat in them. But now this argu|ment would have been wanting in the beginning, quickly after the fall, when there was no other than our fir&s;t Parents.</P>
<P>And altho' we may &s;uppo&s;e, the&s;e inconvenien|ces would have been remedied in a few ages after, when men had multiplied, and repleni&s;hed the Earth, and that then GOD might have &s;ent forth his Son as well as when he did: &mdash;</P>
<P>Yet in an&s;wer hereto it may be &s;aid; that this would not have corre&s;ponded with &s;ome other wi&s;e purpo&s;es, and de&s;igns of GOD. Thus as GOD intended to honour &s;ome particular per&s;ons, by Chri&s;t's de&s;cending from them, according to the fle&s;h; as that he &s;hould be of the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> of the Lineage of <HI>David</HI>; &s;o the&s;e men mu&s;t be them&s;elves, before Chri&s;t could de&s;cend from them. And many others he de&s;igned for eminent Types of Chri&s;t,
<PB N="56" REF="002987_0061_0FE6AF7D41F45DC0">
and others &s;o far favoured as to prophe&s;y concern|ing him, and to give &s;ome particular de&s;cription of him: Now th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e men mu&s;t be born, and live in the World, and prophe&s;y of Chri&s;t before he could come. Furthermore as GOD had wi&s;ely determined to choo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut a particular Nation, for his own peculiar People, and vi&s;ible Church in the World, and among them to have Chri&s;t typified, and &s;hadowed forth by certain Sacri|fices and Ceremonies: So there mu&s;t be this Nation and People offering up the&s;e Sacrifices, and attending the&s;e Ceremonies, before Chri&s;t the great Sacrifice, and Antitype &s;hould come. So that he could not come &s;ooner than he did.</P>
<P>Neither would it have done to have tarried longer before he came: for <HI>that</HI> would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with other wi&s;e &s;chemes, &amp; purpo&s;es of his: and would al&s;o have been a great di&s;cour|agement to Men, &amp; they would have been ready to &s;ay in de&s;pair; Where is, or what is become of the promi&s;e of his coming?</P>
<P>So that all things con&s;idered, the time he actual|ly came in, was the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on for it: and that becau&s;e it was the exact time that was prophe&s;ied he &s;hould come in. And if he had come &s;ooner, or tarried longer, the prophe&s;ies would not have been fulfilled &s;o to a tittle as now they are. And thus neither the truth of GOD, nor the knowledge of GOD would have appeared &s;o con&s;picuous, as now they do. And &s;ome doubts, and &s;cruples would nece&s;&s;arily have ari&s;en about him, whether he was the Chri&s;t or no.</P>
<P>But then again, according to the prophecies,
<PB N="57" REF="002987_0062_0FE6AF8059D8F950">
there was a general expectation of him among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and as Hi&s;torians tell us, among the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o; that is, of a mighty King, who &s;hould be born in tho&s;e days: which &s;erved very much to prepare the people to receive him, when he came among them.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there was at that time a great decay of Piety, &amp; of true Religion: &s;o that there wanted a more than ordinary Prophet to revive it, and none le&s;s then the Son of GOD, was able to give a revival to it. The profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD had &s;unk &s;o deep in the meer Ceremonies of their Religion, to the gro&s;s neglect of the weightier matters of the Law, that it was high time to have them aboli&s;hed: Which could be done no otherwi&s;e than by the coming of Chri&s;t, in whom they all had their accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>And then to mention no more, it being a time of univer&s;al Peace (as has been ob&s;erved by Hi&s;|torians) throughout the World; this made it a very proper time for the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> to enter. For as a time of Peace gave them lea&s;ure, and op|portunity to think, and di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e things; &s;o it created a general Commerce, and Corre&s;pon|dence in the World, which very much facilitated the carrying the Go&s;pel, or the News of a Saviour into all parts of it. Now the&s;e con&s;iderations being laid together, make it very evident that our Lord came into the World in the mo&s;t pro|per &s;ea&s;on for it; and con&s;equently the Wi&s;dom and Prudence of GOD appears in &s;ending him at that very time <HI>to be made fle&s;h and to dwell among us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="002987_0063_0FE6AF806FDA6D60">There are many other In&s;tances of Divine Wi&s;dom in managing the affair of our Redemption. But I mu&s;t leave them at pre&s;ent, and conclude with a hint or two by way of,</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Inf. 1. <HI>How thankful &s;hould we be for the Promi&s;es, and Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament</HI>!</P>
<P>For however u&s;ele&s;s &s;ome may imagine them to be now &s;ince Chri&s;t is come, and the Go&s;pel &s;et up and e&s;tabli&s;hed; yet they are really of va&s;t &s;ervice to the Chri&s;tian World: and are &s;ome of the chief &s;upports of the Chri&s;tian Faith. It is certainly a matter of great importance to have it &s;ufficiently, &amp; &s;atisfactorily proved unto us that Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth</HI> is the Chri&s;t, the true Me&s;&s;iah, the anointed, and cho&s;en of GOD: and we &s;hould be thankful for any arguments to &s;trengthen, and confirm us in the Faith of this grand fundamen|tal Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity. And now as the Promi&s;es, and Predictions of the Old Te&s;tament afford mo&s;t convincing arguments in this matter, we &s;hould be thankful for them. We &s;hould &s;earch the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;tament as well as of the New: and &s;tudy tho&s;e things that are &s;poken of Chri&s;t; and compare them with the Hi&s;tory of him: and we &s;hall find &s;uch an exact harmony, and corre&s;pondence, as will mightily &s;trengthen our faith in him.</P>
<P>Inf. 2. Was Chri&s;t conceived in a miraculous manner, to e&s;cape the natural pollution of Sin?
<PB N="59" REF="002987_0064_0FE6AF86C0BEB068">
<HI>This &s;hould lead us to lament and bewail the cor|ruption of our Natures, and groan to be delivered from it.</HI></P>
<P>For by GOD's being willing to take our Na|ture into per&s;onal union with the Divine, but in &s;uch a manner as wholly to e&s;cape the &s;in that cleaves to us, he plainly &s;hows the infinite evil of Sin, &amp; that Sin is the very thing that &s;eparates between GOD and us. We &s;hould therefore la|ment, and bewail the Corruption of our Natures. Becau&s;e, altho' Chri&s;t was willing to be like us in every thing el&s;e; yet he would not be like us in this, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.15. This then mu&s;t be our grief and &s;orrow, that we are <HI>&s;hapen in iniquity, and that in &s;in our Mothers conceived us.</HI> And we mu&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire to be delivered from this body of &s;in, as being the very thing that now hinders our union to Chri&s;t, and communion with him. For as our Nature could not be united to his Divine Nature, but as it was perfectly pure, and holy; &s;o we can't be united to him, nor have communion with him, before our corrupt nature is mortified, and &s;ubdued within us And as it was by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t that Chri&s;t e&s;caped the pollution of our Natures: &s;o it is by the power of the &s;ame almighty Spirit that this pollution, and corruption is ever taken out of us. This mu&s;t therefore be our heart's de&s;ire, &amp; prayer to GOD, that as Chri&s;t was conceived by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t, and was perfectly free from Sin: &s;o we may be born of the Spirit, and thereby &s;anctified in the whole man through|out in Spirit, Soul and Body, and made holy as he that has called us, is holy</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="002987_0065_0FE6AF86D48382B8">Inf. 3. From what we have heard, <HI>let us all be fully &s;atisfied as to the time of Chri&s;t's appearing in the World.</HI></P>
<P>Some are ready to wi&s;h that Chri&s;t had tarried till this time, before he appeared in the World; that they might &s;ee him, and conver&s;e with him, and behold his Miracles: and think they &s;hould have been more fully confirmed in the Faith of him. But now &s;uch men are vain in their im|aginations. They don't con&s;ider that they have as great advantages for believing in Chri&s;t, as tho&s;e that lived in Chri&s;t's time, and conver&s;ed with him: and con&s;idering that he came at the very time that was predicted of him, and con|&s;idering the other demon&s;trative proofs we have of his having been in the World; the matter is plainer, and more evident, than if he &s;hould have lap&s;ed the time prophe&s;ied of, and waited till this time to make his per&s;onal appearance. Where|fore let us not give way to any &s;uch vain de&s;ires, but be &s;en&s;ible that he came in the fitte&s;t &s;ea&s;on and let us acquie&s;ce and re&s;t &s;atisfied in it. And altho' we have not &s;een him, yet let us love him; let us believe on him, and accept of him as our only Saviour, placing oar dependance upon him, and &s;ubmitting our &s;elves entirely to him; and then we may be a&s;&s;ured of this, that when he &s;hall appear the &s;econd time at the end of the World, <HI>in the glory of his Father and of the holy Angels, we al&s;o &s;hall appear with him in glory</HI>: AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>Sermon, <HI>IV.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="7">VII. ANother In&s;tance of the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the affair of our Redemp|tion, was, <HI>The poor Condition and low Circum|stances, in which</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>appeared in the World</HI></P>
<P>That Chri&s;t appeared in a very poor and low condition, is &s;ufficiently evident from the Hi&s;tory of him in the Go&s;pel. As for his <HI>Parents,</HI> altho' they were of the tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI>; yet they appeared to be but in very mean circum&s;tances. His Father was but of an inferiour Occupation; a <HI>Carpen|ter</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>Matt.</HI> 13.25. And as for our Sa|viour's <HI>Birth,</HI> it was attended with peculiar circum&s;tances of meanne&s;s, and poverty. There was no other room prepared for the Mother of our Lord to be delivered in, than that of a Stable: there <HI>&s;he brought forth her fir&s;t born &s;on, and laid him in a manger,</HI> Luke 2.7. And afterwards when he grew up, he did not grow rich, nor appear with any external or earthly grandeur, as the Jews expected the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> would: but in|&s;tead of this he took upon him the form of a Servant, and made him&s;elf of no reputation, as the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.7. So Poor was he that he had not &s;o much as an hou&s;e of his own, nor any certain dwelling place; he could &s;ay as in Matt. 8.20. <HI>Foxes have bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of man

hath not where to lay his head.</HI> And &s;o &s;traitned was he &s;ometimes for Money, that he had not wherewith to pay his tribute-money, (which amounted to no more than fifteen pence) before he wrought a miracle for it, <HI>Matt.</HI> 17.27.</P>
<P>And now Chri&s;t's appearing in &s;uch low, and de&s;picable circum&s;tances on worldly accounts, (altho' to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, &amp; rock of offence) was an in&s;tance of wonderful Wi&s;|dom and Prudence. For</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It was mo&s;t &s;uitable and becoming,</HI> that he who had our Sins imputed to him, and was about to &s;uffer and make &s;atisfaction for them, &s;hould appear in low &amp; humbling circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t con&s;ider that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was coming on our account: he had taken our Sins upon him, and had undertaken to make &s;atisfaction for them: and therefore a low and humble &s;tate mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t proper for him. Sin is a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for humiliation and aba&s;ement, and humility always becomes a Sinner. And therefore as Chri&s;t was made Sin for us, humility and a low appearance in the World did be&s;t become him. There would have been no congruity, nor agreeablene&s;s in Chri&s;t's coming with external pomp, and glory, at the &s;ame time that he came loaded with our iniquities, and was to be wounded, and brui&s;ed, and die for them. How indecent is it for a Criminal at the Bar to appear in a fine dre&s;s, with great attendants, and other ornaments and marks of greatne&s;s, which he might properly enough appear with at another time. Now
<PB N="63" REF="002987_0068_0FE6AF90114D7950">
altho' Chri&s;t was really no Criminal, becau&s;e <HI>he knew no Sin of his own</HI>; yet imputatively he was the greate&s;t Sinner: for GOD <HI>had laid upon him our iniquities.</HI> So that &s;uch a low condi|tion &s;uited be&s;t with the circum&s;tances he was then under, and with the de&s;ign of his coming.</P>
<P N="2">2. His appearing in &s;uch low circum&s;tances was an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, <HI>as it &s;erved very much to illu&s;trate and &s;et forth the infinite Grace and Conde&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The more Chri&s;t humbled him&s;elf, the more he exalted his mercy, and grace. And what a wonderful di&s;play of grace is it for him, who was the Eternal Son of GOD, to leave the Bo|&s;om of his Father, to leave the realms of light and glory: where he had <HI>thou&s;ands of Angels bowing before him, and a thou&s;and times ten thou|&s;and mini&s;tring unto him:</HI> to come into this World in the lowe&s;t and meane&s;t circum&s;tances of any man in it: for the Lord of Heaven and Earth, yea the GOD over all ble&s;&s;ed forever, to appear in the form of a Servant, to become a Man of &s;orrows and be acquainted with grief, to be cloathed with poverty and loaded with contempt! And we find the Apo&s;tle taking notice of this as a wonderful di&s;play of Grace, 1 Cor. 8.9. Says he, <HI>Ye knew,</HI> (intimating the thing was &s;o plain that every one might &s;ee, and <HI>know) the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who though he was rich; yet for our &s;akes became poor; that ye thro' his poverty might be made rich.</HI> And the &s;ame Apo&s;tle takes further notice of this wonderful grace and conde&s;cen&s;ion, Phil. 2.6, 7.

<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> (as I hinted before) looked for a Me&s;&s;iah, that &s;hould appear in earthly Pomp, and Grandeur; one that &s;hould &s;ubdue all their Enemies for them, and re&s;tore the Kingdom to I&s;rael, and rear up the Throne of his Father <HI>David</HI> that was fallen, and re&s;tore that Nation to all, yea and to greater &s;plendor, riches, and greatne&s;s than in <HI>David's</HI> or <HI>Solomon's</HI> days. And tho&s;e mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of their's, aro&s;e from the gro&s;s and carnal &s;en&s;e they put upon the Prophecies relating to the coming of Chri&s;t. But now this was far from being the de&s;ign of his coming: it was to &s;et up not a temporal, but a &s;piritual Kingdom, and that not to be confin'd to the Jews, but to extend to the Gentiles al&s;o. He was to be a <HI>Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the glory of his people I&s;rael.</HI> Whereas if Chri&s;t had appeared in external Pomp, and Greatne&s;s, in the form of an Earthly Prince, and Monarch; it would have confirmed the Jews in their mi&s;taken notion of his Kingdom: and no doubt they would then have all flocked to him, and owned him for their King and Ruler, and put them&s;elves under his Govern|ment, and protection. But now from what
<PB N="65" REF="002987_0070_0FE6AF94651BF060">
Principles would they then have accepted of Him &amp; &s;ubmitted to Him? Not from any true Chri&s;tian Principles; not from any love to GOD, nor re|gard for his Glory, or in obedience to his Com|mand: nor from a real hatred of &s;in, or de&s;ire to be freed from the &s;piritual bondage they were under to their corruptions, and &s;piritual enemies: But all would have been from carnal, and worldly views; to advance them&s;elves in this world; to have their external, and political Privileges re|&s;tored to them. And now Chri&s;t was &s;en&s;ible of this before he came: and in his great Wi&s;dom determined to appear in a quite different manner from what they expected.</P>
<P>And by his Appearing in &s;uch a low condition, he took the mo&s;t effectual method to convince them of their error, and to let them know that his Kingdom was not &s;uch an one as they expected. He hereby plainly taught them, that it did not con&s;i&s;t in earthly Riches, in &s;plendid Courts, and royal Palaces; but that it was all of a &s;piritual Nature: that it was a Kingdom that comes with|in Men, and is &s;eated in their hearts; and that the acts of Royalty which he performs, are the pardoning Mens &s;ins, the &s;ubduing and mortify|ing their lu&s;ts; the re&s;training &amp; conquering our &s;piritual enemies for us; the guarding us by his power; the guiding us by his coun&s;el, till he re|ceives us to his Kingdom, and Glory, re&s;erved in Heaven for us. Now Chri&s;t's appearing in the manner that he did, had a natural tendency to lead Men into &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion of the nature of his Kingdom; or at lea&s;t to lead them into the
<PB N="66" REF="002987_0071_0FE6AF947B04DF18">
full belief of it, when he expre&s;sly told them as he did, That <HI>his Kingdom was not of this World,</HI> John 18.36. And by this he al&s;o taught them that if they looked for any great temporal Ad|vantages, it was not worth while to come to him. And &s;o,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It proved a very good means to prevent per|&s;ons flocking to him, and profe&s;&s;ing &s;ubjection to him from meer</HI> Worldly <HI>views.</HI></P>
<P>If Chri&s;t had appeared in outward greatne&s;s, many that never did own him, would have pro|fe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjection to him; and he would have been thronged with a number of Hypocrites and pro|fe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects, who knew or at lea&s;t &s;avoured no|thing of the nature of his Kingdom. But now by his appearing in &s;uch a manner as he did; none or but few in compari&s;on were di&s;po&s;ed to own him, but &s;uch as had &s;ome other notion of his Kingdom than that of an earthly one. And &s;o in &s;hort, altho' if he had appeared in outward greatne&s;s, he would have had more profe&s;&s;ed and pretended &s;ubjects; yet he would not have had more, if &s;o many real and hearty ones.</P>
<P N="5">5. His manife&s;ting him&s;elf as he did appears a wi&s;e contrivance, <HI>from the happy tendency of it to lead Men into a contempt of this World, and to the apprehen&s;ion of &s;omething &s;uperiour to outward Pomp and Geatne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>For when the Son of GOD, who mu&s;t needs know the exact worth and value of every thing, had &s;o little regard to earthly grandeur, as not to cloth him&s;elf with it, nor take any particular no|tice of tho&s;e that were; he plainly &s;how'd his
<PB N="67" REF="002987_0072_0FE6AFA07B4C9A60">
own contempt of this World and all things in it: and what better argument could we have to de&s;|pi&s;e it, to look and live above it; and to give the preference infinitely to a renewed nature, an holy heart and an harmle&s;s life; which Chri&s;t him&s;elf had &s;o much greater regard for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an for all the outward pomp and glory of this World.</P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Another in&s;tance of divine Wi&s;dom, <HI>was the</HI> METHODS <HI>taken to</HI> PROVE <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t the true</HI> MESSIAH, <HI>the Saviour that was pro|mi&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Here indeed, I might fir&s;t of all &s;ay in general, that it was Wi&s;dom, and Prudence in GOD <HI>to prove</HI> him the Me&s;&s;iah. For unle&s;s he had given &s;ome evident proof, and demon&s;tration of it, there would have been no &s;ufficient grounds for any to believe in him; and &s;o none would have received any benefit by him And therefore GOD in his Wi&s;dom and Grace did, upon his coming, give proofs, and demon&s;tration of his being the Chri&s;t. And now the Methods he took for this, manife&s;t a great deal of Wi&s;dom, and Prudence; which will appear by a brief con&s;ideration of the Ways and Methods taken to prove him to be the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>; and the&s;e may be reduced to Three heads; <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>His Accompli&s;hing the <HI>Prophecies</HI> concerning Him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>His working <HI>Miracles.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>And,</HI> the <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> that were given of him, when he was on Earth.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="68" REF="002987_0073_0FE6AFA0936E0B78">1. One Method for proving JESUS to be the CHRIST, was his <HI>accompli&s;hing the Prophecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah.</HI></P>
<P>You may remember I told you in a former di&s;|cour&s;e, that there were many Prophecies con|cerning Chri&s;t in the old Te&s;tament, which an&s;wered many wi&s;e and good Ends: one of which was that they &s;erved to point out the Me&s;|&s;iah, when he &s;hould come, and di&s;tingui&s;h him from any Impo&s;tor; accordingly Chri&s;t when he came, took this Method to prove him&s;elf to be the Chri&s;t, by accompli&s;hing every Prophecy and Prediction concerning him. There were many things foretold concerning his birth; as the time when, and the place where; &s;o were there many things &s;poken of his life, and death, and many circum&s;tances relating thereto. All which Chri&s;t took care exactly to fulfill: as will evidently ap|pear to any one that will compare the Hi&s;tory with the Prophecy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Method he took was, <HI>to work Mi|racles.</HI></P>
<P>As for his doing any Miracles before he was a|bout to enter upon his Publick Mini&s;try we have no account: but after that we have almo&s;t innu|merable in&s;tances of Miraculous operations per|formed by him; and tho&s;e of every kind. He wrought Miracles upon the Wind, and the Seas, &s;tilling them by a word's &s;peaking; upon the Wa|ter, turning it into Wine; upon Bread &amp; Fi&s;hes, multiplying them miraculou&s;ly for the feeding va&s;t Multitudes with a &s;mall quantity of them; upon Trees, cau&s;ing them to wither immediately
<PB N="69" REF="002987_0074_0FE6AFA1D36754B8">
at his Command; and what a Multitude of Mi|racles did he work upon the Bodies of Men; healing all manner of di&s;ea&s;es in a Miraculous manner without the u&s;e of means. He cau&s;ed the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the dumb to &s;peak, the blind to &s;ee, and the lepers to be clean&s;ed. Nay by Him Devils were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the dead rai&s;ed to life.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Te&s;timonies that were given of him,</HI> was another Method made u&s;e of for the proving him to be the <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And here we might begin with the Te&s;timonies that were given by the Inanimate Creation: Such as the extraordinary Star that appeared (a|bout the time of his Birth) to the <HI>Magi,</HI> or wi&s;e Men of the Ea&s;t, and led them to the very place where the Child lay, and they fell down, and wor&s;hipped him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.11. And then at his Death univer&s;al nature &s;eem'd to give te&s;timony concerning him. For when he was hanging on the Cro&s;s, the <HI>Sun was darkned, and there was darkne&s;s over all the earth, and the vail of the Temple was rent front the top to the bottom, the earth quaked, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened</HI>; which, as it filled the Centurion and tho&s;e that were with him with exceeding fear and trembling, &s;o it drew forth that confe&s;&s;ion from them, <HI>that truly this was the Son of GOD,</HI> Mat. 27 54.</P>
<P>But then not only &s;uch Inanimate Creatures gave te&s;timony of him, but GOD al&s;o at that time endowed Men, and Women with a Pro|phetick Spirit to te&s;tify concerning him. Thus good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> who had been <HI>waiting for the
<PB N="70" REF="002987_0075_0FE6AFA1E9F01968">
Con&s;olation of I&s;rael,</HI> was kept alive to the birth of Chri&s;t; and when he was brought into the Temple, to have the cu&s;toms of the law performed upon him, this good old Man was brought thither by the Spirit, who took the Child in his arms, declaring him to be the Per&s;on whom GOD <HI>had prepared before the face of all People, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people I&s;rael,</HI> Luke 2.31, 32. And <HI>Anna</HI> an ancient Prophete&s;s, did at the &s;ame time al&s;o <HI>te&s;tify of him to all them that looked for Redemption,</HI> Luke 2.37, 38.</P>
<P>And after this when he was grown up, there was his fore-runner, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, who being to prepare the way for him, te&s;tified concer|ning him, that he was the Chri&s;t. Thus be&s;ides many other times, we find him upon Je&s;us's coming towards him, pointing out to him and &s;aying to tho&s;e that were with him, as in Joh. 1.29. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;ins of the World.</HI> But then Chri&s;t was te&s;tified of not only by Man, but by the Angels in Heaven. Thus an Angel was &s;ent to tell the Virgin, That <HI>She was to be with Child by the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and to bring forth <HI>an holy thing, which &s;hould be called the Son of God.</HI> And then he is &s;ent again to tell <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> that his e&s;pou&s;ed Wife was <HI>with Child by the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and that the Child that &s;hould be born of her, &s;hould be called <HI>Je&s;us: b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cau&s;e he was to &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</HI> And then again at his Birth the Angels are &s;ent to inform the Shepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s in and about Bethlehem, that that very day <HI>there was born to them, in the city of
<PB N="71" REF="002987_0076_0FE6AFAE20E641A8">
David, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord</HI>: And tell them where they &s;hould find him. And up|on it a multitude of them joyn in con&s;ort, &s;inging, <HI>Glory to GOD in the Highe&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. As in Luke 1<HI>&s;t</HI> &amp; 2<HI>d.</HI> Chapters.</P>
<P>But then not only the <HI>Angels</HI>; but the very <HI>Devils</HI> were forced to confe&s;s, and bear te&s;timony of him, that <HI>he was the Son of GOD,</HI> Matt. 8.29. And then that there might be nothing wanting, but that there might be the fulle&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t evidence in this matter; GOD him&s;elf gave te&s;timony concerning him once and again by an audible voice from Heaven. Thus at his Bapti&s;m, when he came up from the Water and the Spirit of GOD <HI>like a Dove</HI> lighted upon him; then a voice came from Heaven, <HI>&s;aying, This is my be|loved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed,</HI> Matt. 3.17. And after the &s;ame manner was it at his Tran&s;|figuration on the Mount.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e were the ways that were taken to prove and demon&s;trate Je&s;us of Nazareth to be the Chri&s;t, and herein appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence. For</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a Method <HI>the mo&s;t convincing, and de|mon&s;trative that could be.</HI></P>
<P>What more effectual way can we imagine, could be taken, to convince Rational Creatures, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is the Chri&s;t, than the method that has been taken for it? What could be a more con|vincing evidence, that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, than his being found with all tho&s;e marks and cha|racters upon him, that were predicted of the
<PB N="72" REF="002987_0077_0FE6AFAE34910BE8">
Me&s;&s;iah, and accompli&s;hing every prophecy to a tittle that was made concerning him? This alone one would think &s;ufficient to convince a Man of unprejudiced rea&s;on. But if we add to this the many and mighty Miracles, which he wrought for the confirmation of what he declared, and profe&s;&s;ed concerning his being the true Me&s;&s;iah: and at the &s;ame time con&s;ider how ab&s;urd it would be to &s;uppo&s;e, GOD would enable him to work &s;uch a Multitude of Miracles for the proof of a thing that was not true: I &s;ay, he that con|&s;iders the nature of GOD, and the nature of mi|racles, and the declared de&s;ign of tho&s;e wrought by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, would have &s;ufficient matter of conviction by them, that he was what he profe&s;&s;ed and declared him&s;elf to be. But then if to all this we add the expre&s;s te&s;timony of men Divinely in&s;pired, of Angels, and of the very Devils, and la&s;t of all, of GOD him&s;elf who has once and again by an audible voice declared him to be <HI>his beloved Son</HI>: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will be impo&s;&s;ible to gain&s;ay, or &s;tand again&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he force of &s;uch ir|refragable arguments. And none but &s;uch as are given up to judicial blindne&s;s of mind and hardne&s;s of heart, would pretend to evade the force of them. The method GOD has taken, is not to force Men to the profe&s;&s;ion and acknow|ledgement of Je&s;us for the Chri&s;t, contrary to our Judgment; but he has con&s;idered us as Ra|tional Beings: and has laid matter of conviction before our minds to induce us by the force of rational argument, not only to confe&s;s with our mouths, but to believe in our hearts, that Je&s;us
<PB N="73" REF="002987_0078_0FE6AFAFABE04CC0">
is the Chri&s;t. And now GOD's taking a method &s;o convincing, and demon&s;trative, as it was an act of Wi&s;dom; &s;o it was of Grace, and conde&s;cention in GOD to our natures and capacities.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Method for proving <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be the <HI>Christ,</HI> was wi&s;ely contrived, <HI>as it was very much for the honour of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' Chri&s;t did not appear with any marks of Earthly greatne&s;s; yet in the Method that was taken to prove him to be the Chri&s;t, he honoured him&s;elf, and had peculiar marks of honour put upon him. Thus he magnified his Truth, by ac|compli&s;hing the prophecies and promi&s;es, &s;o ex|actly as he did, and &s;how'd that as he <HI>was full of grace,</HI> &s;o was he <HI>full of truth.</HI> And then he illu&s;trated and made his great Power known in the many &amp; mighty Miracles which he wrought; by them he &s;hewed that all power was given to him in Heaven and Earth; that univer&s;al nature was at his command, and that his Kingdom ruled over all. And altho' the Jews were &s;tumbled at his appearing in the form of a Servant; yet by the Miracles that he wrought, he appeared to have an infinitely greater Empire and Govern|ment than they ever expected for their Me&s;&s;iah. Moreover his Miracles were of &s;uch a Nature, as to magnifie his Goodne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ions to Men. They were not meerly for the &s;ake of &s;howing a Miracle, as <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI> was when his Rod was turned into a Serpent, and then returned again into a Rod: much le&s;s were they like &s;ome of the other Miracles wrought by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> even tho&s;e miraculous Plagues, and Judgments,
<PB N="74" REF="002987_0079_0FE6AFAFC5CB6218">
teaching them, <HI>by terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> But in&s;tead of this, mo&s;t, if not all Chri&s;t's Mi|racles were Miracles of goodne&s;s, kindne&s;s and benignity; for the benefit, relief and comfort of Mankind. We don't read of any Miracles of his that were injurious to men, but acts of kind|ne&s;s to the Per&s;ons that were the &s;ubjects of them, which &s;erved to &s;et forth how abundant he was in goodne&s;s. I don't remember above two in|&s;tances objected again&s;t this ob&s;ervation. One is the Devils entring into the herd of Swine, and their running into the deep and being drowned. The other is that of his cur&s;ing the <HI>Barren Fig-tree,</HI> and cau&s;ing it to dry, and wither away. Now as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it may be &s;aid in an&s;wer to it, that it was no Miracle at all: for the Miracle was in di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Man, of the Le|gions of Devils that had entred into him. And as for the Devils entring into the Swine, it was only by permi&s;&s;ion: that is, Chri&s;t did not &s;ee cau&s;e to re&s;train them. As for the &s;econd, it ap|pears from Matt. 21.19. <HI>to &s;tand in the high way</HI>&punc; and &s;o had no particular proprietor that was in|jured by the cur&s;ing of it. But then if it had been any Man's propriety, it's being a barren tree, the cau&s;ing it to wither, could be no injury or damage.</P>
<P>And then again, how great was the honour done to Chri&s;t by the <HI>Te&s;timonies</HI> that were given of him? Thus altho' he was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger, yet the appearance of that bright and &s;hining Star, and the Songs and Acclamations of joy by the Heavenly Ho&s;t,
<PB N="75" REF="002987_0080_0FE6AFB80DA70A78">
upon his Birth, were much greater honour, than to have been born in a Palace.</P>
<P>And then again, GOD's proclaming him once and again <HI>his only begotten Son in whom he was well plea&s;ed,</HI> was an infinitely greater honour than for the whole I&s;raeliti&s;h Nation to have proclamed him their King and &s;ubmitted to him. Nay, when he was hanging and dying on the Cro&s;s, as the vile&s;t Malefactor, yet by the Sun's withdrawing it's light, the Earth's quaking, the Rocks rending, the Graves opening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there was more honour done him, than if he had been &s;eated on the throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the Princes and great Men bowing before him. Thus altho' he appeared in outward meanne&s;s, yet care was taken, that even in the deepe&s;t of his humiliations, there &s;hould be a great deal of honour done unto him.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Method &s;hows the Wi&s;dom of GOD, <HI>as hereby GOD has taken effectual care to vindi|cate his Ju&s;tice in the de&s;truction of tho&s;e, that will not believe in</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>after they have heard of him.</HI></P>
<P>As GOD will certainly puni&s;h with an ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction, the Infidel and Unbelieving, &s;o it is very requi&s;ite that he &s;hould appear ju&s;t when he &s;peaks, and clear when he judges and condemns them. And now by the Method he has taken to prove Je&s;us to be the Chri&s;t, he has given &s;uch convincing proof and demon&s;tration of it, as to leave all without excu&s;e, and ju&s;tly puni&s;hable, that will not believe on him: by this means he left the Jewi&s;h Nation wholly without
<PB N="76" REF="002987_0081_0FE6AFB8252DE608">
excu&s;e for not receiving him as their Lord Me&s;&s;iah, and made that utter de&s;truction as a People, that GOD quickly brought upon them, to be very ju&s;t, and righteous. And by this means GOD will al&s;o vindicate him&s;elf in the &s;evere&s;t, and heavie&s;t puni&s;hment, that he brings on unbe|lievers&punc; for having laid &s;uch a foundation for faith in Chri&s;t, when he &s;entences the unbelie|ving to the everla&s;ting burnings prepared for the Devil, and his Angels, we mu&s;t &s;ay as in Rev. 16.7. <HI>Even &s;o, Lord God Almighty, true, and righteous are thy Judgments!</HI></P>
<P>I have not time to enter upon any other In|&s;tances of Wi&s;dom in this grand affair of our Redemption at pre&s;ent. And &s;o &s;hall conclude with applying and improving what has been now delivered.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Inf. 1. What we have heard of the poverty and meanne&s;s of Chri&s;t's appearance, <HI>&s;hould pre|vent our undervaluing, or de&s;pi&s;ing any of the Saints, for their being poor and low in the World.</HI></P>
<P>That many of the Children of GOD are in poor and low circum&s;tances, is no le&s;s evident, than it is common for them to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and undervalued by others upon the account here|of. A poor Man, altho' a Saint and a child of GOD, is oftentimes the object of contempt: his Grace wont &s;ecure him from the contempt of the men of this World. But now how unrea|&s;onable
<PB N="77" REF="002987_0082_0FE6AFBE4D4F41D0">
is <HI>this?</HI> For by what we have heard we find that a per&s;on may have true greatne&s;s, and real excellence, and yet have little or nothing of this World's good. For thus it was with our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf, he was in a very low condition on worldly accounts; but yet he had that in him that recommended him to our highe&s;t e&s;teem: altho' he was poor yet he was <HI>the chief among ten thou&s;ands; altogether lovely.</HI> And thus it is with many of the Saints: they have little of this World's goods; and yet they are worthy of our love and e&s;teem. They have that in them that is infinitely more ex|cellent than all earthly good, they have a prin|ciple of Saving Grace which is better than &s;ilver and gold, more precious than rubies; and all the things we can de&s;ire, are not to be compared with it. They have the &s;ame Mind and Spirit in them that was in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: they have the Image of GOD upon them, and are in favour with him, which ought to re|commend them to us, let them be ever &s;o poor on worldly accounts.</P>
<P>Here therefore let me &s;ay, that he that de&s;|pi&s;es a Saint becau&s;e he is poor, de&s;pi&s;es the Grace of GOD, de&s;pi&s;e his image and like|ne&s;s, and implicitly de&s;pi&s;es Chri&s;t him&s;elf for appearing in a low condition, &amp; Chri&s;t looks up|on the contempt offered to his Saints as offered to him&s;elf, Luke 10.16. <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me: and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent me.</HI></P>

<P>I don't mean that any &s;hould make them|&s;elves poor, to be conformed to Chri&s;t in it, nor be &s;o &s;atisfied in a poor condition as to neglect all lawful means for the bettering their circum&s;tances.

We &s;hould argue with our &s;elves, that if Chri&s;t put him&s;elf into &s;uch a low condition for our &s;akes, &s;urely we &s;hould be content, when he orders out no wor&s;e for us than for him&s;elf, and &s;hould con&s;ider the force of tho&s;e words of his, Matt. 10.24.25. <HI>The Di&s;ciple is not above his Ma&s;ter, nor the Servant above his Lord: it is enough for the Di&s;ciple that he be as his Ma&s;ter, and the Servant as his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Inf. 3. <HI>Let us all be thankful for the wi&s;e and effectual Method that has been taken, to convince the World that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>If GOD had not taken &s;uch a way to con|vince us of this truth, how much doubt and uncertainty &s;hould we labour under? And what danger would there be of our being carried away with an evil heart of unbelief? How thankful then &s;hould we be that GOD has

left &s;o little room for us to doubt in a matter of &s;uch infinite importance to every one of us?

<P>We are told, John 1.14. <HI>The Word was made fle&s;h, and dwelt among us.</HI> He did not only a&s;|&s;ume the Humane Nature; but he tabernacled or dwelt here upon Earth among Men, and conver&s;ed with them for a time. He lived upon Earth between thirty and forty Years, according to the be&s;t Chronologers. Indeed mo&s;t of that time was &s;pent in a private man|ner, with his Parents, and (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) working with his reputed Father at the Car|penter's Trade. Hence he is called not only the Carpenter's Son; but <HI>the Carpenter,</HI> Mark, 6.3.
<PB N="80" REF="002987_0085_0FE6AFC5C329CC98">
But when he was about thirty years old, the age (that the Prie&s;ts, were allowed to mini&s;ter in holy things) he &s;et out upon his Publick Mini&s;try. At which time al&s;o he called his Di&s;ciples to accompany him in his Mini&s;try; to hear his Doctrines, to &s;ee his Miracles, and to ob&s;erve his Life and Conver&s;ation. And as for his Preaching, the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of it was Repentance, Faith, Humility, and Meek|ne&s;s, Charity and Forgiving one another, a Con|tempt of this World, Heavenly mindedne&s;s, Sincerity and uprightne&s;s, and the like. A great part of his publick Preaching was im|ployed in expo&s;ing tho&s;e carnal interpreta|tions, and corrupt glo&s;&s;es, which the <HI>Jews</HI> had put upon the Law; and in teaching them the Spirituality and Exten&s;ivene&s;s of the Divine. Precepts: that they extended not only to the gro&s;&s;er, and more external acts, but that they reached to the very thoughts, de&s;ires and in|tents of the Heart. It was al&s;o imployed very much in reproving the <HI>Jews</HI> for their Hypocri|cy and for re&s;ting &s;o much in carnal Ceremo|nies, and vain traditions. He taught them al&s;o that he was the Chri&s;t that they had ex|pected, who was prophe&s;ied of, and promi&s;ed to them; and invited, exhorted and directed all to come to him and believe in him, a&s;&s;uring them there was no other way to the Father, or to eternal Life, but in and thro' him.</P>
<P>And then as to his Life and Conver&s;ation, it was altogether worthy of, and agreable to the Per&s;on he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be, and altogether
<PB N="81" REF="002987_0086_0FE6AFCA1CE59158">
conformed to the doctrines he taught, and the precepts he laid down for others. He &s;at before them an exact Pattern of what he taught them. The &s;ame rules of living that he preached up to them, he ob&s;erved is his own life. He confor|med to the law of GOD in every article that be|longed to him. He never was guilty of the lea&s;t fault, or failing, or mi&s;conduct in the whole cour&s;e of his life: and there could be <HI>no fault found in him.</HI> But as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays it became him, Heb. 7.26. <HI>He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled &s;eparate from &s;inners.</HI> He went about doing good: <HI>glorifying GOD on earth, and fini&s;hing the work that GOD had given him to do. As he &s;ays of him&s;elf,</HI> Joh. 17.4. And now in all this there appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>And that upon this account in general, &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>That this was the mo&s;t effectual way to e&s;tabli&s;h the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation; which Chri&s;t was then a|bout to &s;et up in the World.</HI></P>
<P>It was now high time to abrogate and lay a&s;ide the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation of Ceremonies, and car|nal Ordinances; for the <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;unk all their religion into Ceremony and outward form. And the Ceremonies they laid &s;o great &s;tre&s;s upon, were not &s;o much tho&s;e that had been taught them by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> as what they received by tradition. And hence we have our Saviour complaining of them, for <HI>making the Commandment of GOD of none effect by their tradition,</HI> Mat. 15.6. They thought that if they were careful <HI>to wa&s;h their hands before meat; and tyth'd mint, anni&s;e and cummin,</HI> and the like, they might &s;afely neglect
<PB N="82" REF="002987_0087_0FE6AFCA322203D0">
the <HI>weightier matters of the law; righteou&s;ne&s;s, mercy, and faith.</HI></P>
<P>It was therefore very nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Ce|remonies &s;hould be aboli&s;hed: and that a more refin'd and &s;piritual religion &s;hould be &s;et up; whereby Men might do their duty in a more &s;pi|ritual manner, and from more &s;ublime and hea|venly principles, than the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> led them into.</P>
<P>But now, how &s;hould this be done? who would undertake to bring it to pa&s;s? For the <HI>Jews</HI> had received the law by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> whom they ju&s;tly e&s;teemed as one of the greate&s;t Pro|phets that had ri&s;en among Men. This is the Te&s;timony given of him after his Death, Deut. 34.10. <HI>That there aro&s;e not a Prophet &s;ince in I&s;rael like unto</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>whom the Lord knew face to face</HI>: That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, whom GOD conver&s;ed with, and communicated him&s;elf to, in &s;uch a familiar, immediate manner.</P>
<P>And then, be&s;ides the great, and ju&s;t veneration they had for <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> there is to be con&s;idered, that if had been a law of long &s;tanding, which their Fa|thers had been in the practice of, and in the &s;ame way (as they imagined) for two thou&s;and years. And they looked upon all the Judgments that had befallen their Nation, to be the fruit of their A|po&s;tacy from, and neglect of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> All which things, we may &s;uppo&s;e made it very difficult to bring the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ews</HI> off from their law, and e&s;pecially from their oral traditions, which they looked upon to be above the written law; to embrace another di&s;pen&s;ation of a more &s;ublime and &s;piritual nature.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="002987_0088_0FE6AFD3D83547E8">And now, who &s;o proper to undertake this affair, as the Son of GOD him&s;elf? There was no meer Man that could have appeared with greater Authority than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did: and therefore no &s;uch could have appeared with Authority &s;uffi|cient to abrogate, or &s;uper&s;ede what he had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the Me&s;&s;iah, the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at Anti-type, or &s;ub&s;tance of all the Cere|monial law, &s;hould appear, in order to the aboli&s;h|ing of it.

Add now this Pro|phet was Chri&s;t: as appears from <HI>Acts</HI> 3.22. So that Chri&s;t's coming and dwelling with the <HI>Jews,</HI> his preaching, and prevailing as he did, was the mo&s;t effectual means to lay a&s;ide the Ceremonial law, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. His coming into the World, and dwelling a|mong us, as he did, was a plain demon&s;tration <HI>of his Humanity; that he was really and truly Man, and &s;o one of their Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>If Chri&s;t had fir&s;t appeared in the World at his full growth and Man's e&s;tate, and had when
<PB N="84" REF="002987_0089_0FE6AFD3EBF3D0D8">
he &s;hewed him&s;elf for a while di&s;appeared, there would many doubts have ari&s;en about his Huma|nity, they would have looked upon him only as &s;ome Spectre; &s;ome Spirit only appearing in hu|mane &s;hape; and would not have believed him to be really and truly Man. And &s;o not one of their Brethren rai&s;ed up from among them, and con&s;equently not that Prophet that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fore|told them of; whom they were to hearken unto. And &s;o they would have had more pretence for their not hearkning unto him and rejecting him. But now by his being born among them in a na|tural and ordinary way (how miraculou&s;ly &s;o|ever he was conceived) and by coming into the World an Infant, and growing up as other Chil|dren do, both in Wi&s;dom, and in Stature, till he came to Man's e&s;tate, and living above thirty years among them: I &s;ay, by this he took the mo&s;t effectual method to convince them that he was really and truly Man, in all things made like unto his Brethren, with all humane Infirmities, &s;in only excepted: and con&s;equently that he was one of their Brethren: which, together with other circum&s;tances concurring, gave mo&s;t convincing evidence, that he was <HI>that Prophet</HI> that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had told them, GOD would rai&s;e up unto them, unto whom they were to hearken; even altho' it was to lay a&s;ide &s;ome of the&s;e things that <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> him&s;elf had taught them.</P>
<P N="2">2. His dwelling among Men, and teaching them per&s;onally, <HI>gave great Authority to the Doctrines them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="002987_0090_0FE6AFD604726998">He being about to aboli&s;h the legal, and &s;et up the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation: It &s;eem'd very proper that Chri&s;t &s;hould come in his own Per&s;on to make this mighty alteration and change in their con&s;titution: becau&s;e this was the mo&s;t effectual way to give Credit &amp; Authority to his doctrines. For altho' he appeared to be really, &amp; truly Man; yet he appeared with marks of Divinity upon him, and proved him&s;elf to be the Son of GOD. And now what could give &s;uch Authority to any doctrines, or di&s;po&s;e per&s;ons more readily to re|ceive them, than for the Son of GOD him&s;elf to teach them? That which gives Authority to any doctrine, is the apprehen&s;ion of its coming from GOD. Now what better evidence could there be of a doctrin's coming from GOD than its being delivered by the Son of GOD, who came out from the Bo&s;om of the Father, and whom the Father did once, and again by an audible voice from Heaven, declare to be <HI>His beloved Son, and commanded them to bear him?</HI> Mat. 17.5.</P>
<P>So that altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> had a great veneration for <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and look'd upon the Mo&s;aical con&s;titu|tion to come from GOD, (as indeed it did) yet when Chri&s;t the Son of GOD per&s;onally appeared, there was &s;ufficient rea&s;on for them to hearken to his doctrine, altho' it was to lay a&s;ide the Cere|monial law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> For altho' they might have de&s;pi&s;ed any meer Man that had taught any thing contrary to their law, and treated him &s;hamefully, as the Husbandmen in the Parable did the Servants of the Hou&s;eholder; but as he &s;aid, &s;o GOD might ju&s;tly expect, that &s;urely,
<PB N="86" REF="002987_0091_0FE648A5860463D8">
<HI>they would reverence his Son,</HI> Mat. 21.37. So that it was wi&s;ely contrived of GOD, that when he had <HI>at &s;undry times, and in divers manners &s;poken to the Fathers by the Prophets, he has in the&s;e la&s;t days,</HI> when he was &s;etting up the Go&s;pel King|dom, <HI>&s;poken to us by his Son.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST's coming, and dwelling among Men was very proper when he was about to lay a&s;ide the Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Jewi&s;h Church, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Go&s;pel; <HI>becau&s;e they had their accompli&s;hment in Him, and were &s;uper|&s;eded by Him.</HI></P>
<P>We are told, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.1. That <HI>the law,</HI> that is the Prie&s;thood, the Sacrifices, and Ceremonies of it, were <HI>&s;hadows of good things to come.</HI> That is, they were &s;hadows or dark repre&s;entations of Chri&s;t, and of the great Sacrifice he &s;hould once make of him&s;elf; and of the benefits he &s;hould purcha&s;e for us by that Sacrifice. And now, as the &s;hadow was to continue till Chri&s;t the Sub|&s;tance came, and no longer: &s;o it was nece&s;&s;ary, when the legal Con&s;titution which was only a &s;hadow of Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel &s;tate was to be aboli&s;hed, that Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;hould make his appearance in the World: who being the Antitype, or the Sub&s;tance that was &s;hadowed out, might &s;uper&s;ede, &s;catter, and remove tho&s;e &s;ha|dows. For by his coming, and accompli&s;hing what they prefigured of him, he made it appear, that they had an&s;wered the end for which they were In&s;tituted at fir&s;t, and that there was no further occa&s;ion for them And thus the Apo&s;tles, after they had received the holy Gho&s;t, under&s;tood it;
<PB N="87" REF="002987_0092_0FE6AFD9DA8AAD80">
and were accordingly for laying the whole Cere|monial law a&s;ide: excepting in a few particulars which they &s;ubmitted to for Peace-&s;ake, whil&s;t a Judaizing &s;pirit continued among the Chri&s;tian Jews.</P>
<P N="4">4. CHRIST's dwelling among us when he was made fle&s;h, was very &s;erviceable to the De|&s;ign he was upon; <HI>becau&s;e his Life was &s;o con|formed, to his Doctrines, and Precepts, as to be a mighty recommendation of them, and &s;erved very much to lead Per&s;ons into the Belief and Practice of them.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;carce any thing that recommends a vertue more, than to have it drawn out and de&s;cribed in a Man's life. Examples we all find are more powerful than Precepts. Accordingly our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;aw cau&s;e, not only to deliver his Precepts to us; but al&s;o to tran&s;cribe them in his own life: and thereby has left on record the mo&s;t perfect Pattern of holine&s;s, that ever was in Man; which was certainly the mo&s;t effectual way to credit, e&s;tabli&s;h, and promote the holy and &s;piritual Religion of the Go&s;pel he was &s;etting up.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Life and Conver&s;ation he led in the World, <HI>He demon&s;trated his Truth, and Sincerity, with re&s;pect to the Doctrines, and Precepts that he taught them.</HI></P>
<P>His Life, and Conver&s;ation being &s;o agreable to what he taught them, gave &s;ufficient proof that he was &s;incere and hearty in what he &s;aid, that he told them nothing but what he believed, and knew to be true. He reproved them for no|thing
<PB N="88" REF="002987_0093_0FE6AFD9F3E02AA8">
but what he refrained from him&s;elf. He commanded them nothing but what he conformed to him&s;elf, &s;o far as it could belong to him: the rules he gave to others, he made the rules of his own conduct; which mu&s;t needs convince Men that they were what he knew to be the be&s;t rules for Men to govern them&s;elves by. For it can't be thought he would practice according to his own rules, unle&s;s he knew in his heart that they were the be&s;t. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. His Life, and Conver&s;ation &s;erved very much <HI>to &s;et forth the Excellency of his Religion.</HI></P>
<P>In order to the &s;incere, and hearty practice of Chri&s;tianity, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;ee, and have a convincing evidence of the beauty &amp; excellency of it. And now what external way is there that can &s;o elegantly &s;et forth the beauty of holine&s;s, and the excellency of all Chri&s;tian graces, as the perfect copy of them drawn in a Man's life? They are much more livelily expre&s;s'd, in actions than in words. It is the living the&s;e vertues and graces, and not &s;o much the &s;peaking them, that recommends them. And thus did our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour recommend them to us by his own life: for he &s;trictly ob&s;erved his own Precepts, &s;o far as they cou'd relate to him. Now what could recommend a life of piety, and devotion, a life of Ju&s;tice, and Charity, an heavenly Walk, and Conver&s;ation, &s;o much as Chri&s;t's &s;etting a perfect Pattern of the&s;e things before us? For, as it rendred Chri&s;t him&s;elf amiable in the eyes of all, but &s;uch as were perver&s;ely &s;et again&s;t him: &s;o did it give a Reputation to the vertues
<PB N="89" REF="002987_0094_0FE6AFDC06AC2140">
them&s;elves. They never appeared &s;o glorious, as in the life of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> And there is nothing of outward means, that is now more help|ful to encourage and promote piety, and holine&s;s, goodne&s;s, and charity, a contempt of this world, and the like, than the &s;urveying our Saviour's life, as it is recorded in his Go&s;pel. Which fur|ther &s;hows the Wi&s;dom and Prudence of GOD, in ordering Chri&s;t's abode with us for a time, and living &s;uch a life among Men. For &s;ince &s;uch an holy and &s;piritual Religion was to be &s;et up, it was certainly a point of Wi&s;dom to take the mo&s;t effectual means for the recommending of it unto the World.</P>

And &s;o it is now become even
<PB N="92" REF="002987_0097_0FE6AFE5059B2A58">
an act of Ju&s;tice in GOD, to pardon, and be re|conciled to the &s;inner that repents, and believes in Je&s;us. Hence the Apo&s;tle tells us, 1 Joh. 1.9. <HI>If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful, and</HI> JUST, <HI>to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It is with regard to our Surety, an act of Ju&s;tice in GOD, to forgive the &s;ins of Be|lievers; and he will be faithful and ju&s;t to do it. And now in &s;uch a wonderful manner as this, does the death of Chri&s;t remove all the difficulties in the way to our being pardoned and ju&s;tified; which &s;eemed in&s;uperable, and would have puz|led not only the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, but the brighte&s;t Angel in heaven; which &s;erves to &s;et forth the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the contrivance.</P>
<P N="2">2. This was the mo&s;t effectual way that could be contrived, <HI>for the illu&s;trating the infinite Love, and Grace of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to be contrived, that could &s;o clearly di&s;play the boundle&s;s riches of divine Grace, as the &s;ufferings, and death of the Son of GOD. How could GOD the Father have expre&s;&s;ed greater love, and grace, than in parting with his only begotten &amp; dearly beloved Son out of his own Bo&s;om; to receive all the Ignominy, and reproach that Men could put upon him, and to endure the cruel, &s;hameful, and cur&s;ed death of the Cro&s;s? And then how could Chri&s;t have manife&s;ted greater love, and grace to Man than in laying down his life for us? There is nothing &s;o dear to Man, of a temporal nature, as LIFE. It is an undoubted truth, al|tho' &s;poken by the father of lies, <HI>Skin for skin,
<PB N="93" REF="002987_0098_0FE6AFEB8163F118">
yea all that a man hath, will he give for his life,</HI> Job 2.4. Accordingly the highe&s;t in&s;tance of love that can be among Men, is for one Man to part with, or lay down, his life for another: and this is an in&s;tance of love that is exceeding rare among Men, and can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to be exerci&s;ed towards any, but a very particular friend. For thus &s;ays our Saviour, (who be&s;t knew the degree of love that Men could exerci&s;e towards one another,) Joh. 15.13. <HI>Greater love hath no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n than this; that a man lay down his life for his friend.</HI> And where is the Man that has &s;o great a love as this? But as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. 5.8. <HI>GOD has commended his love to us</HI> (given higher manife&s;tations of it) <HI>in that while we were &s;inners,</HI> and enemies, <HI>Chri&s;t dyed for us.</HI> And now herein appeared the Wi&s;|dom of GOD: becau&s;e as he intended to make a glorious manife&s;tation of his love and grace, he has mo&s;t effectually an&s;wered his end, by Chri&s;t's enduring the Cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame for <HI>our &s;akes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Death of Chri&s;t was a wi&s;e contrivance, as it was the mo&s;t effectual Method that could be, <HI>to di&s;cover the infinite Evil of Sin, and to de|ter us from a &s;inful cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>It was very proper, and requi&s;ite for the Sove|reign of the World, when he was about to pardon and &s;ave Sinners, to give &s;ome full manife&s;tations of the horrid and odious nature of &s;in: and take effectual care, not to give us the lea&s;t encourage|ment to go on in &s;in: but that we &s;hould have as much rea&s;on to be afraid of it, and to &s;trive
<PB N="94" REF="002987_0099_0FE6B1220377B5E8">
again&s;t it, as ever. And now what way could be taken to convince us more effectually, that &s;in was the wor&s;t of Evils; that it was infinite|ly offen&s;ive to the pure Eyes of GOD's Glory; and infinitely dangerous for us to go on in &s;in; than to &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">readful effects of it upon our Saviour, when it was imputed to him? How could we have had a more lively Idea of the horrid nature, and the dangerous con&s;equences, of &s;in; than by the dying groans and agonies of the Son of GOD; when he bore our &s;ins in his own body on the tree? Here we find, that when he had our &s;ins upon him, he was ready to &s;ink under the weight of them, and would have done &s;o, had it not been for his Divinity which &s;upported him. Into what an agony did &s;in put him, when <HI>his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as exceeding &s;orrow|ful, even unto death</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that he <HI>&s;weat as it were great drops of blood: and cryed to his Father, again, and again,</HI> that if it <HI>were po&s;&s;ible, the bitter cup might pa&s;s from him!</HI> And when he cryed out in &s;uch angui&s;h of Soul upon the Cro&s;s, <HI>My God, my God! why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!</HI> Now if the Son of GOD him&s;elf was ready to &s;ink un|der the weight of his Father's wrath, when he undertook to &s;atisfie for our &s;ins; this will na|turally and nece&s;&s;arily lead us to conclude, that there is an infinite Evil in &s;in: and that it would be a mo&s;t fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD, with the guilt of &s;in upon us. We are naturally led to argue after this manner: If the Son of GOD could not help crying out, when under the wrath of GOD for
<PB N="95" REF="002987_0100_0FE648A7EA8C0B48">
our &s;in, how in&s;upportable will our torments be, who are obliged to receive the puni&s;hment of our own Iniquities? Was Chri&s;t's Soul ex|ceeding &s;orrowful, when he was making &s;atis|faction for &s;in, how then will our hearts endure, or how &s;hall our hands be &s;trong, when GOD &s;hall come to deal with us?</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how the death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t give the mo&s;t convincing evidence of the evil of &s;in; and afford one of the be&s;t argu|ments to di&s;&s;wade and deter us from it. And here I will venture to &s;ay; altho' &s;ome may think that if they did but hear the crys of the damned in hell, they &s;hould be affrighted from their &s;inful ways; yet that the dying crys and groans of the Son of GOD are as &s;trong an ar|gument to di&s;&s;wade and deter us from &s;in: and he that will not be moved by this con&s;ideration, neither would he be effectually per&s;waded, al|tho' one &s;hould come from the bottomle&s;s Pit with the flames of hell about him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another wi&s;e and good End an&s;wered by the death of Chri&s;t, <HI>is that it affords mighty En|couragement to Sinners, to come unto him: and a &s;ure foundation of Comfort, to all &s;uch as are in him.</HI></P>
<P>Since Chri&s;t had undertaken our Salvation, and we were to be ju&s;tifyed, and &s;aved by <HI>faith</HI> in him; it was nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;ome|thing to convince us that he was able to &s;ave us: thereby to encourage us to repair to him, and depend upon him for Salvation. And now what could &s;o convince us of his being able to
<PB N="96" REF="002987_0101_0FE6AFEB966A6740">
&s;ave us, as the &s;eeing him pay the price of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Redemption, and make full &s;atisfaction to GOD for our &s;ins; by &s;uffering the puni&s;hment due unto us for them? for if we &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e Chri&s;t proclaiming him&s;elf a Saviour, able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that &s;hould come unto GOD by him, and yet had never endured the&s;e cruel &s;ufferings, and this cur&s;ed death: I &s;ay, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, we &s;hould not have been &s;o much encouraged to go to him, nor have &s;uch a foundation to depend upon him, as now we have. We &s;hould have been more doubting, and unbelieving. For the con|&s;ideration of the inflexible Ju&s;tice of God, his glorious Holine&s;s, his immutability &amp; Truth, would naturally rai&s;e great doubts in our minds, whether he would ever pa&s;s by our &s;ins, without a &s;atisfaction for the wrong done to all his perfections by them.</P>
<P>But now Chri&s;t having made his Soul an offering for &s;in, and been obedient unto Death, even the death of the Cro&s;s; and thereby having made full &s;atisfaction for the wrong done by &s;in; he has given the mo&s;t convincing evidence, that he is a compleat Saviour. Since he has paid a price for our ran&s;om, having been wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities; we may with courage, and confidence go to him, and depend upon him; a&s;&s;ured, <HI>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. For as he &s;trongly argues in 34. <HI>v. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chri&s;t that dyed.</HI> So that
<PB N="97" REF="002987_0102_0FE6AFF7F44D53F8">
indeed the death of Chri&s;t is one of the greate&s;t encouragements &s;inners have to come unto him for life: for as the Apo&s;tle tells us, Heb. 9.26. <HI>He has taken away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. And by that one offering hath perfected for ever them that are &s;anctified,</HI> Chap. 10.13.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another good End an&s;wered by the Death of Chri&s;t, <HI>was the Confirmation of his Doctrines.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t had taught that he was the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> prophe&s;ied of, and promi&s;ed; that he was the Son of GOD, and the Saviour of the World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now the&s;e being the grand Doctrines of Chri&s;ti|anity, the very foundation of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion; it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould give the highe&s;t te&s;timony that could be, of the truth here|of. And what fuller confirmation could he have given, that he taught nothing but what he be|lieved, and knew to be true, than to lay down his life for the te&s;timony that he had given, and to &s;eal his Doctrines with his blood?</P>
<P N="6">6. Another good End an&s;wered by the Suffer|ings and Death of Chri&s;t is, <HI>That they &s;erve not only as a Pattern, for direction to us in &s;uffering and dying; but al&s;o as an Argument, to reconcile us unto &s;ufferings, and death it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t a&s;&s;ured his Di&s;ciples, and followers, that in the World they &s;hould have tribulation: and they all find it &s;o by experience. But now the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and his behaviour under them, &s;erve as a <HI>Pattern,</HI> to direct us how we mu&s;t be|have our &s;elves under &s;ufferings, and under the apprehen&s;ions &amp; approaches of death. If he had
<PB N="98" REF="002987_0103_0FE6AFF80DD945D8">
not been a Man of &s;orrows, he could not have left us a Pattern of &s;uffering-graces. How could he have left us an Example of Patience, of profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;ignation to the will of GOD; or of a forgiving &s;pirit towards his Enemies, and the like; if he had not had bitter cups to drink, and received injuries and abu&s;es from Men?</P>
<P>But then he becomes not only a more full and perfect Pattern and Example to us hereby; but his &s;ufferings &s;erve mightily to <HI>&s;upport,</HI> and com|fort the Saints under their afflictions. If they meet with the fore&s;t trials, &amp; the heavie&s;t afflicti|ons, they have this to comfort them; That it is no more than what their Lord and Ma&s;ter him|&s;elf met withall. And indeed there are &s;carce any &s;ufferings to be met with in this life, but that we may comfort our &s;elves with this thought; That Chri&s;t had a &s;hare of the &s;ame. And our Savi|our offers this as an argument of comfort to his Di&s;ciples. Joh. 15.18. <HI>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</HI> And now his having been under the &s;ame troubles and afflictions, affords great comfort, from this con&s;i|deration; that he knows how to pity us, to &s;uc|cour, and &s;upport us under them. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. la&s;t. <HI>In that he him&s;elf having &s;uffered, being tempted, he is able to &s;uccour them that are tempted.</HI> Fur|thermore, <HI>The captain of our &s;alvation became per|fect thro' &s;ufferings,</HI> Heb. 2.10. After he had &s;uf|fered a while, he entred into his glory. And this &s;erves wonderfully to reconcile us to, and comfort us under &s;ufferings; becau&s;e after the &s;ame man|ner we mu&s;t be perfected. 1 Pet. 1.10. <HI>But the
<PB N="99" REF="002987_0104_0FE6AFFB9CF03018">
God of all grace, which hath called us unto his eter|nal glory, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, after that ye have &s;uffered a while, make you perfect.</HI> And thus even Death it &s;elf is made more ea&s;y to Belie|vers, and the Grave &s;weetned by Chri&s;t's having been there before them: e&s;pecially con&s;idering that as they are to be conformed to him in the likene&s;s of his Death, they will al&s;o in his Re|&s;urrection: An in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom hereafter to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another good end an&s;wered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ings and Death of Chri&s;t, <HI>was an entire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the de&s;igns of his Enemies; advancing his own Kingdom and Intere&s;t in that very way, which his Enemies thought wou'd ruin and de&s;troy it.</HI></P>
<P>Men, &amp; Devils, the Enemies of Chri&s;t, thought nothing &s;o effectual to de&s;troy him and his in|tere&s;t, as to put him to death. The Devil him|&s;elf no doubt thought that it Je&s;us was but once dead, his Intere&s;t would be de&s;troyed and his own Kingdom would &s;till remain undi&s;turbed. Accordingly the Devil entred into <HI>Judas,</HI> tempt|ing him to betray his Ma&s;ter: and filled the <HI>Jews,</HI> e&s;pecially the Chief Prie&s;ts and Scribes and Phari&s;ees, with &s;uch rage and malice again&s;t him, that they prevailed &s;o far as to get him Crucified, and having thus actually procured his Death, the Devil and the unbelieving Jews concluded they had given a mortal &s;troke to his intere&s;t, and that his de&s;igns and attempts would have been wholly fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>But behold how the Wi&s;dom of GOD out-did all the Policy of Earth and Hell! For that which
<PB N="100" REF="002987_0105_0FE6AFFBB1965600">
it was thought would have utterly de&s;troyed the Intere&s;t and Kingdom of Chri&s;t, was the very means of advancing it, and de&s;troying the King|dom of Satan. When he thought he had given a mortal blow to Chri&s;t, it proved a deadly wound to him&s;elf. The Serpent, by brui&s;ing the heel of the Seed of the Woman, had his own head brui&s;ed and broken. And here is the Wi&s;|dom of GOD in a My&s;tery, that Chri&s;t by dying overcame death, and <HI>de&s;troyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.14.</P>
<P>Other in&s;tances of Divine Wi&s;dom in the affair of our Redemption, mu&s;t be left to another oppor|tunity. And I mu&s;t conclude at pre&s;ent with one word briefly, by way of Exhortation.</P>
<P><HI>Let us all be thankful to Chri&s;t the Eternal Word,</HI> that when he was made fle&s;h he was plea|&s;ed to dwell among us for &s;o long a time as to give &s;ufficient evidence that he was one of us; and did really partake of fle&s;h and blood with us.</P>
<P>And let us be thankful for the excellent Doctrines and Precepts, that he has delivered un|to us, for the rule of our faith and manners; and for the tran&s;cript he has given of his own pre|cepts in his Life, whereby he has mightily re|commended them unto us, giving us therein the cleare&s;t view of the amiablene&s;s of Religion and the beauty of Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially let us be thankful <HI>for his Suffer|ings and Death</HI>; which, altho' &s;o bitter to him, yet were &s;o much for the Glory of GOD, and of infinite advantage to Mankind. And &s;ince
<PB N="101" REF="002987_0106_0FE6B00400F70260">
Chri&s;t has died for us, let us not only admire and adore the riches of his love and grace herein, but be al&s;o encouraged herefrom to fly to him for refuge, and depend upon him for Salvation. Let us believe and be per&s;waded that by his Death he has fully &s;atisfied Divine Ju&s;tice, and paid our debt to the utmo&s;t farthing; in&s;omuch that GOD can now be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of him that believes in Je&s;us. GOD forbid, that we &s;hould glory &s;ave in the Cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us! Becau&s;e by that only can we be delivered from the Cur&s;e of the Law and &s;aved from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>And now in&s;tead of taking encouragement to go on in Sin, becau&s;e Chri&s;t has died and made &s;atisfaction for it; let us be more than ever <HI>de|terred from a Sinful cour&s;e.</HI> Let us but con&s;ider how much it co&s;t the Son of GOD to make &s;ati&s;|faction for Sin; and then con&s;ider how dreadful our condition mu&s;t needs be, if we mu&s;t an&s;wer for our own Sins (as we mo&s;t certainly &s;hall) if we die in them: and this will make us afraid of Sin. Let us con&s;ider, if Sin fetched &s;uch dreadful groans from the Son of GOD, what &s;hrieks and crys it will fetch from us in the Flames of Hell forever, when we come to bear the puni&s;hment of our own Iniquities.

<P N="11">XI. IN the RESURRECTION <HI>of Chri&s;t from the Dead, and his</HI> AS|SENSION <HI>into Heaven, there appears a great deal of Divine Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour having by &s;hed|ding his bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od, and laying down his Life, made full &s;atisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice for &s;in: He did not long continue under the power of Death&punc; but aro&s;e again from the dead the third day according to the Scriptures; and having &s;hown him&s;elf a|live to his Di&s;ciples and to many others for forty days; He then a&s;cended up into Heaven, and fits at the right hand of GOD the Father, where he ever lives to make Interce&s;&s;ion for us. And now
<PB N="103" REF="002987_0108_0FE6B009111A3C20">
in this affair there appears a great deal of the Wi&s;dom and Prudence of GOD: and that whe|ther we con&s;ider the manner and circum&s;tan|ces of it: or the wi&s;e and good Ends that have been and are an&s;wered by it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Manner</HI> of Chri&s;t Re&s;urrection and A&s;|cen&s;ion, <HI>and the circumstances that attended them,</HI> di&s;cover much of the divine Wi&s;dom &amp; Prudence.</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that as it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that Chri&s;t &s;hould ari&s;e from the Dead: &s;o it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be done in &s;uch a way &amp; manner as to afford inconte&s;tible Evidence of the certainty of it, and that there &s;hould be no room left for doubts and jealou&s;ies to unprejudi|ced minds. For a great deal depended upon his Re&s;urrection. The whole Chri&s;tian Religion hung upon it. For having foretold his Re&s;ur|rection; if he had not ri&s;en according to his word, he would have proved him&s;elf to be an Im|po&s;tor; and all that intere&s;t which he had gained in the world would &s;oon have come to nothing. Whereas on the other hand, his ri&s;ing again from the dead being what he him&s;elf foretold, and be|ing in it &s;elf a mo&s;t miraculous operation, mu&s;t needs &s;erve very much to e&s;tabli&s;h his doctrines, and confirm to every one, that he was the Per&s;on he had declared him&s;elf to be. Therefore it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that when he aro&s;e there &s;hould be &s;uch proof, and demon&s;tration of it, as would be &s;atisfactory to a rational Unprejudiced per&s;on; for unle&s;s there be &s;ufficient proof of his Re&s;urrection from the dead, there would not be &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe his doctrines, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to
<PB N="104" REF="002987_0109_0FE6B00926992638">
imbrace his Religion. And now this was well con&s;idered and thought of by GOD, and accor|dingly the affair of his Re&s;urrection as to the man|ner, and circum&s;tances of it, were &s;o contrived as to leave no room for doubts, or uncertainties in the matter, to &s;uch as will but be &s;atisfied with the &s;ame degree of evidence in <HI>this,</HI> as they are in a thou&s;and other i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tances.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall not de&s;cend to all the particu|lar circum&s;tances that might be mentioned rela|ting to this affair, but &s;hall content my &s;elf with &s;ome general hints, which will &s;erve to &s;how that there has been a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Coun|&s;el in the management of it.</P>
<P>And here I might &s;ay, fir&s;t of all, that the <HI>Time</HI> in which Chri&s;t aro&s;e after his death, was wi&s;ely contrived; which was on the third day. For it was very nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould continue under the power of death &s;o long a time, as to make it evi|dent that he was really dead. If he had revived quickly after he gave up the Gho&s;t; People would not have readily believed that he had been dead, but only that he had fainted, or fallen into &s;ome fit; as many per&s;ons do, and to appearance are dead, but recover them&s;elves again There|fore to prevent any doubts or cavils as to the reality of his death, he continued in the &s;tate of the dead till the third day: which is beyond the time that any can be &s;uppo&s;ed to continue in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">oon, or fit.</P>
<P>And it was al&s;o wi&s;ely &amp; graciou&s;ly contrived that he &s;hould ri&s;e within &s;o &s;hort a time after his death. For if he had continued much longer

the power of death, before he triumphed over it in his Re&s;urrection; &s;o was there in the cir|cum&s;tances that attended his Re&s;urrection, which afforded full demon&s;tration that he did really and truly ri&s;e from the dead, and that they were not in the lea&s;t impo&s;ed upon. And here it is to be ob&s;erved as an act of Wi&s;dom in Chri&s;t that before his death, he told them when he &s;hould ri&s;e, even on the third day. Whereby he gave not only his Di&s;ciples, but even his Enemies, fair opportunity to watch his Sepulchre, and &s;ee whe|ther he was as good as his word, or no.

For they remembring what he had &s;aid concerning his ri&s;ing on the third day, &s;u&s;pected that <HI>his Di&s;|ciples would come by night and &s;teal him away, and then &s;ay he was ri&s;en, and &s;o the la&s;t error would be wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI> The Chief Prie&s;ts there|fore and the Phari&s;ees de&s;ire of Pilate, <HI>That the Sepulchre might be made &s;ure until the third day.

&s;o as there was none, it &s;erved to confirm the truth, and certainty of the fact. For th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e that were &s;et to watch the Sepulchre, were hereby ena|bled to witne&s;s to his Re&s;urrection; and did lay &s;ufficient matter for conviction before the Chief Prie&s;ts and Elders to leave them inexcu&s;able for their perver&s;ene&s;s, and infidelity. For when the Soldiers were according to their orders watching on the Morning of the third day (as doubtle&s;s they did) with a great deal of care being the day he told them he &s;hould ri&s;e; I &s;ay, when they were lo king out &s;harply, expecting his Di&s;ciples would come to &s;teal him away: behold at that very time the Angel came down from Heaven, and rolled away the &s;tone from the Door of the Sepulchre, and &s;at upon it in &s;uch brightne&s;s, and lu&s;tre, as that the Soldiers were all filled with Amazement; <HI>they did &s;hake and became as dead men.</HI> And the Angel tells the Women that came ju&s;t at that time to &s;ee his Sepulchre, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was not there, but was ri&s;en from the dead, as he had &s;aid; and invites them to come near, and &s;ee the place where he had lain. And not only cer|tain Women, but &s;ome of his Apo&s;tles came al&s;o and &s;aw that he was gone out of the Sepulchre.</P>
<P>But now if he had gone immediately into Hea|ven, without making his per&s;onal bodily Appear|ance among Men, there would have been a great deal of room left for doubts and &s;u&s;picions among Men; and indeed if he had not appeared vi&s;ibly among Men, it would have been morally impo&s;|&s;ible to bring Men into the belief of his Re&s;ur|rection. This therefore was wi&s;ely con&s;idered by
<PB N="108" REF="002987_0113_0FE6B017FA207670">
Chri&s;t. He accordingly abode &s;ome time upon Earth after his Re&s;urrection, and &s;hewed him&s;elf frequently unto his Di&s;ciples; he conver&s;ed with them, and eat with them; and cau&s;ed <HI>Thomas</HI> that was the mo&s;t doubting of his Di&s;ciples, to feel of him, to &s;ee the print of the Nails in his hands, and to thru&s;t his hand into his &s;ide that had been pierced with the Spear, by which he gave the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Evidence that he was indeed ri&s;en, and had the very &s;ame body he laid down in the Grave.</P>
<P>But then becau&s;e a few are more ea&s;ily deluded, and impo&s;ed upon, than a great number, and were not &s;o ready to believe any wonderful thing rela|ted by a few per&s;ons: This therefore did Chri&s;t con&s;ider, and &s;hewed him&s;elf not only very fre|quently to his Eleven Di&s;ciples, but he &s;hewed him&s;elf to a great multitude at once, even to above five hundred Brethren, as appears from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.6. And now herein appeared the Wi&s;dom of GOD, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Act. 1.3. <HI>That he &s;hewed him&s;elf alive after his Pa&s;&s;ion by many infallible proofs; being &s;een of them forty days, and &s;peak|ing of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>And as he took care to give infallible proofs of his Re&s;urrection, &s;o did he al&s;o to prove his A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven. That he did not ju&s;t ap|pear, and then dye again, but that as he &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, he a&s;cended to <HI>his Father and their Father, to his God and their God</HI>; for he did not go up <HI>Incognito,</HI> but he took his Di&s;ciples with him to the Mount of Olives: and when he had ble&s;&s;ed them, and in a &s;olemn manner taken his
<PB N="109" REF="002987_0114_0FE6B026771F4848">
leave of them; and while their eyes were fixed upon him, he A&s;cended up gradually towards Heaven; &s;o that they actually &s;aw him going up till a cloud interrupted. But then that no|thing might be wanting to &s;trengthen their faith in this matter; two of the Angels that came to wait upon Chri&s;t in his triumphant progre&s;s to Heaven, are &s;ent back to tell them not to gaze any longer, becau&s;e he was a&s;cended to Heaven, and that they &s;hould &s;ee him return in like man|ner, as they had &s;een him go up: that is at the day of Judgment, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.10, 11. And then for a further confirmation, we have the Te&s;timony of the ble&s;&s;ed Proto-Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI>; who becau&s;e he was the fir&s;t that dyed for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, had a glorious revelation made to him, and de|clares ju&s;t before his death, That <HI>he &s;aw the hea|vens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God,</HI> Act. 7.56.</P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee a great deal of Wi&s;dom, and Prudence in the Manner of Chri&s;t's ri&s;ing from the dead, and a&s;cending to Heaven: for they have been carried on in &s;uch a manner as to afford &s;uffi|cient and &s;atisfactory evidence to rea&s;onable and unprejudiced minds.</P>
<P>Some may po&s;&s;ibly think it would have been better if he had appeared more pub|lickly after his Re&s;urrection; and that if he had then &s;hewed him&s;elf to his Crucifiers, and the Infidel Jews, they would have believed on him. But to this it may be &s;aid that he gave &s;ufficient demon&s;tration of his Re&s;urrection. And that this even the Chief Prie&s;ts and Elders them&s;elves
<PB N="110" REF="002987_0115_0FE6B0268F32F208">
had &s;ufficient matter for Conviction offered to them by the report they received from the Soldiers, whom they them&s;elves had appointed to watch the Sepulchre, and which were doubt|le&s;s &s;uch as they could put confidence in. Which together with the Miracles he had wrought in in their pre&s;ence before his death, and other concurring circum&s;tances for the proof hereof, made it altogether unnece&s;&s;ary for him to do any thing further to convince them. For when &s;uitable, and &s;ufficient means won't an&s;wer it is no ways con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of GOD to &s;toop to all the perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate humours of Men. But I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Re&s;urrection &amp; A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t there will appear a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence, if we con&s;ider <HI>the wi&s;e, and good Ends that are an&s;wered hereby.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t &s;erved <HI>for the confirmation of all his Doctrines, &amp; of the Religion, that he came to &s;et up among Men.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour had told them before hand of his ri&s;ing again from the dead within three days, which as it would be a &s;ign or token of his coming from GOD, &s;o would be a confirma|tion of all he had taught them. But now if he had not ri&s;en from the dead as he promi&s;ed, he would have proved him&s;elf an Impo&s;tor, and de|ceiver of the People, and his Religion that he was &s;etting up would have come to nothing. But now by his being &s;o good as his word in this grand Article of his Re&s;urrection, he has confirmed the truth of all that he &s;aid unto
<PB N="111" REF="002987_0116_0FE6B027C2B36030">
them. By this he has given demon&s;tration that GOD was with him; and that he was &s;uch a Divine Per&s;on, even the Son of GOD, as he had declared: as the Apo&s;tle tells us, Rom. 1.4. <HI>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, ac|cording to the Spirit of holine&s;s by the re&s;urrection from the dead.</HI> And now if his Re&s;urrection de|clared him to be the Son of GOD, it does by con&s;equence declare the truth of all that he had taught &amp; commanded. For if he was the Son of GOD, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to deliver anything but what is agreable to truth. And now, as I &s;ay he was declared to be the Son of GOD with power by his Re&s;urrection from the dead, that is, his Re&s;urrection was a demon|&s;tration of his being the Son of GOD. (For if he had nor been the Son of GOD, he could not have rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the dead by his own power. And mo&s;t certainly GOD would never have rai&s;ed him from the dead, if he had fal&s;e|ly pretended to be the Son of GOD. For as it is impo&s;&s;ible for GOD to lye, &s;o is it impo&s;&s;ible for him &s;o far to confirm a lye, or countenance bla&s;phemy, as he would have done in rai&s;ing Chri&s;t from the dead, if he had not been the Son of GOD, as he profe&s;&s;ed.) So that the Re&s;ur|rection of Chri&s;t affords anirrefragable argu|ment for the truth of Chri&s;tianity. In&s;omuch that if we do but believe that Chri&s;t <HI>both died and ro&s;e again and revived,</HI> we mu&s;t believe, we mu&s;t receive and embrace Chri&s;tianity, and be fully &s;atisfyed in the truth of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection, as it &s;erves to a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="112" REF="002987_0117_0FE6B027D93AE490">
us that he had by his death made full &s;atis|faction for &s;in, <HI>&s;o it affords &s;trong Con&s;olation to all that believe in him.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t having undertaken for us, and our &s;ins being laid upon him; if his Death had not been a &s;atisfactory &s;acrifice, he could not have ri&s;en from the dead, much le&s;s have a&s;cended into Heaven. Therefore his ri&s;ing from the dead plainly teaches, yea a&s;&s;ures us, that by the <HI>one offering of him&s;elf he fini&s;hed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and made an end of &s;in, and brought in an everlasting righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Chri&s;t's being di&s;charged from the Pri&s;on of the Grave, makes it evident that by his death he &s;atisfyed the demands of Ju&s;tice, and had paid the debt to the utmo&s;t far|thing that he had undertaken for: which mu&s;t needs afford joy, &amp; con&s;olation to all that believe in him; becau&s;e they have a&s;&s;urance hereby that their &s;ins are &s;atisfyed for, their debt paid, and they di&s;charged, and no condemnation belong|ing to them. For the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t in a peculiar manner ju&s;tifies them or frees them from Condemnation; or rather gives a&s;&s;urance of their Ju&s;tification, by a&s;&s;uring them that &s;atis|faction is made for them. As the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom. 4.25. <HI>He was delivered for our offences, and rai&s;ed for our Ju&s;tification.</HI> That is, &s;ays an Expo&s;itour, <Q>Chri&s;t did Meritoriou&s;ly work our Ju&s;tification by his Death. But the Effi|cacy, and perfection of it with re&s;pect to us, depends on his Re&s;urrection. By his Death he paid our debts, by his Re&s;urrection he re|ceived our acquittance.</Q> If he had continued
<PB N="113" REF="002987_0118_0FE6B034E18B1110">
under the power of death, his death would have been of no benefit to us. But every true Believer may now &s;ay in holy triumph and joy, as in Rom. 8 34. <HI>Who is he that Codemneth! It is Chri&s;t that died, yea</HI> rather <HI>that is ri&s;en again</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion &s;erved <HI>intirely to take away the &s;candal of the Cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t's Sufferings, and Death were &s;uch as carried a great deal of Ignominy, and Reproach with them. To &s;uffer and die at all was Infinite Humiliation: but the death he died was the mo&s;t &s;hameful as well as cruel death, which was inflicted only upon &s;laves, and only the vile&s;t of them. So that this would have been a perpetual reproach to him; and would have been a &s;uffici|ent rea&s;on for every Man's not believing in him, as their Saviour, who him&s;elf had died as the vile&s;t Malefactor; unle&s;s this reproach and &s;candal were &s;ome way or other taken off. The Preach|ing of <HI>a crucified Chri&s;t was to the Jews a &s;tum|bling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.23. And well it might, if they had preached no|thing el&s;e concerning him, or if nothing further could be &s;aid of him. But now his glorious Re|&s;urrection and triumphant A&s;cen&s;ion &s;erved en|tirely to remove <HI>this &s;tone of &s;tumbling, and rock of offence.</HI> For his Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion did him more honour than he could &s;uffer re|proach by that cur&s;ed death of the Cro&s;s. By this he has appeared with more Magnificence and Glory than all earthly pomp and greatne&s;s could po&s;&s;ibly have afforded him By this <HI>he was de|clared to be the Son of God with power.</HI> He has
<PB N="114" REF="002987_0119_0FE6B034F523E1C0">
herein triumphed over death, and the grave: and &s;hewed that altho' he &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of death; yet he could not be held by the Chains of death, but that as he had power to lay down his life, &s;o he had power to take it again.</P>
<P>And now what rea&s;on is there to be in the lea&s;t &s;candalized at Chri&s;t, altho' he was dead, &s;ince GOD has rai&s;ed him from the dead, and he is now alive, and lives for ever more, and has the keys of hell and of death? Who need be offended at Chri&s;t's <HI>enduring the cro&s;s and undergoing &s;uch &s;hame,</HI> &s;ince he is now <HI>&s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God</HI>!</P>
<P N="4">4. Another good end an&s;wered by the Re&s;ur|rection of Chri&s;t is, <HI>that it affords a powerful ar|gument for our own Re&s;urrection to an Immortal State.</HI></P>
<P>The doctrine of the Re&s;urrection, altho' it was never thought of by the heathen World, and &s;eem|ed incredible to them when they fir&s;t heard of it; yet it is a doctrine of great importance, very ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the believed; and becau&s;e it appears with &s;ome difficulty, to believe that our bodies af|ter they have for thou&s;ands of years been moulde|red into du&s;t, will be gathered together, and for|med into the &s;ame bodys again; hence it is very nece&s;&s;ary that this doctrine &s;hould &s;ome way or other be well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and confirmed, in or|der to bring Men into the full belief of it.</P>
<P>And now what way could GOD have taken more effectually to convince Men of the truth of this doctrine than by giving a Specimen or Ex|ample of it; as he did in Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection
<PB N="115" REF="002987_0120_0FE6B03674907B60">
from the dead. Indeed, before the coming of Chri&s;t, &s;ome per&s;ons had been miraculou&s;ly rai&s;ed from the dead: as the Son of the Woman of <HI>Za|rephath</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 17. and the Son of the <HI>Shunamite</HI> by the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> 2 <HI>King.</HI> 4. But the&s;e were only rai&s;ed to a mortal &s;tate, they died again; as did all tho&s;e without doubt that our Saviour him&s;elf rai&s;ed from the dead whil&s;t he dwelt among us, and &s;o they were no examples of our being rai&s;ed to Im|mortality. And altho' &s;ome have been tran&s;la|ted to an Immortal &s;tate, &s;uch as <HI>Enoch</HI> &amp; <HI>Elijah</HI>&punc; yet they never actually died as other Men. So that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the fir&s;t that ever truly died and then ro&s;e with an immortal Body, after the manner that all Mankind &s;hall be rai&s;ed at the la&s;t day.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Matthew,</HI> in reckoning up the &s;trange things that happened at Chri&s;t's death, mentions this, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.52. <HI>That the graves were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints that &s;lept aro&s;e.</HI> But then by the next ver&s;e it looks mo&s;t probable, and the generality of Expo&s;itors agree to it, that this was after his Re&s;urrection; and that the Evangeli&s;t is only &s;umming up in gene|ral the wonderful Events that happened about that time. And this agrees be&s;t with what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 Cor. 15.20. <HI>Chri&s;t being ri&s;en from the dead is become the first fruits of them that &s;leep.</HI> And with his being called <HI>the fir&s;t begotten of the dead,</HI> Rev. 1.5. Which could not truly be &s;aid if any had ri&s;en before him. So that Chri&s;t's Re|&s;urrection was a pledge and token of our Re&s;ur|rection;
<PB N="116" REF="002987_0121_0FE6B03690360258">
and a&s;&s;ures us that we &s;hall all ri&s;e again: they <HI>that have done good to the Re&s;ur|rection of life</HI> and happine&s;s; <HI>they that have done evil to the Re&s;urrection of damnation.</HI> But e&s;pe|cially does the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t afford full a&s;&s;urance to Believers that they &s;hall ri&s;e again, for he is their my&s;tical, and &s;piritual Head, and they are the Members: and if the Head be ri&s;en all the Members mu&s;t certainly follow. And now that the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is a good ar|gument for our Re&s;urrection, appears from the Apo&s;tle's arguing it from that con&s;ideration, 1 Cor 6.14. <HI>And God hath both rai&s;ed up the Lord, and will al&s;o rai&s;e us up by his own power.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.14. <HI>Knowing that he which rai&s;ed up the Lord Je&s;us, &s;hall rai&s;e up us al&s;o by Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Another good end an&s;wered by the Re&s;ur|rection and A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, <HI>is that it &s;erves to rai&s;e our Minds above this World, and &s;et them upon things that are above.</HI></P>
<P>For &s;ince Chri&s;t has left the World, and gone to Heaven, if we have a &s;incere and hearty love for him, we &s;hall follow him with our hearts; we &s;hall look upon him as our trea&s;ure, <HI>and where our trea&s;ure is, there will our hearts be al&s;o.</HI> The thought that Chri&s;t has left the World, &amp; gone to Heaven, will cau&s;e the believing Soul to de&s;pi&s;e &amp; ca&s;t an holy contempt upon this World, and will carry out the Soul in longing de&s;ires to get to that ble&s;&s;ed place where he is, that we might behold, and partake of his Glory. The Apo&s;tle thought that to be with Chri&s;t was far better than to be here, in &s;o much that he was willing to be
<PB N="117" REF="002987_0122_0FE6B0402A75CFE0">
ab&s;ent from the body, and leave this World, to be pre&s;ent with the Lord, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.23. And the thought that Chri&s;t is gone to Heaven will put every &s;aint upon looking upward, will fix his affections there, and will put him upon making his Intere&s;t there, as &s;ure as he can. It leads them to con&s;ider that this World is not their home, but where Chri&s;t their Saviour dwells, to whom they expect and hope at la&s;t to be received. And hence does the Apo&s;tle argue with us after this manner, Col. 3.1. <HI>If ye then be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, &s;eek tho&s;e things that are a|bove, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right hand of God.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Another good End an&s;wered by the Re&s;ur|rection &amp; A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t is, <HI>that by this means we have a powerful Advocate &amp; Interce&s;&s;or with the Father.</HI></P>
<P>For being ri&s;en from the dead and a&s;cended to Heaven, He there appears in the pre&s;ence of GOD for us, pre&s;enting his crucifyed Body, and pleading the Merits of his &s;ufferings &amp; obedience on our behalf; which as it is of infinite advan|tage, &s;o it mu&s;t needs afford un&s;peakable comfort to the Saints.

that intere&s;t thro' the &s;everal Ages of the World to this day.

<P N="1">(1.) Let us con&s;ider the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> imployed in carrying on this great, and difficult affair, <HI>who were a few poor Illiterate Fi&s;her-men</HI>; and it will appear to be a &s;urprizing in&s;tance of di|vine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Indeed con&s;idering the difficulty, and impor|tance of the work, we &s;hould have thought (if we had been con&s;ulted in the matter) that no Beings inferiour to the glorious Angels could have carried on this affair to effect: Humane rea&s;on would have thought that the only, or the more likely way would have been for tho&s;e bright Intelligences, who excel in wi&s;dom and &s;trength, to have come down among Men, to prevail with them to receive, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">orace the &s;ublime Doctrines and Duties of Chri&s;tianity. But altho' this might appear mo&s;t agreable to the wi&s;dom of Man, yet it did not to the wi&s;|dom of GOD. And if we do but thorowly con&s;ider the matter, we &s;hall &s;ee the Per&s;ons that GOD pitched upon, to be much more proper and &s;uitable. For if tho&s;e Mini&s;tring
<PB N="123" REF="002987_0128_0FE6B05457D4A1B8">
Spirits had come down in vi&s;ible Shapes among Men, and the Go&s;pel had been delivered by the Mini&s;try of Angels, as the law was from Mount Sinai, it would indeed have filled Men, as it did the I&s;raelites, with terror and amazement, and frighted Men into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it: but they would not have been per&s;waded into an hearty entertainment of the Go&s;pel from &s;uch clear, rational Convictions, as now they were; and as is proper for rational and free Agents to be. Moreover, if &s;uch powerful In&s;truments had been immediately and apparently imploy|ed in this work, the power of GOD in the &s;ucce&s;s of the Go&s;pel would not have been &s;o vi&s;ible, and apparent, nor &s;o readily owned, and acknowledged as now it is.</P>
<P>But then &s;uppo&s;ing we &s;hould have thought it proper to imploy Men, &s;ome of our &s;elves, as In&s;truments to carry on this affair, yet &s;urely we &s;hould have concluded that the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t effectual cour&s;e would have been to chu&s;e the highe&s;t ranks and orders of Men for that &s;ervice: tho&s;e that had the greate&s;t E&s;tates, were highe&s;t in authority, and that had the mo&s;t powerful and exten&s;ive Influence upon others. But now even this upon a more thorow con&s;ideration does not appear to be &s;o wi&s;e, and prudent a cour&s;e as that which the wi&s;dom of GOD made choice of. For altho' perhaps ma|ny more People might have profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tia|nity than there did; yet they would not have done it from &s;uch true, rational &amp; Chri&s;tian principles: they might perhaps have come into

the profe&s;&s;ion of it, for fear of their &s;uperiours, or for fa&s;hion &s;ake, or to plea&s;e tho&s;e they had their dependence upon; or from &s;ome &s;uch like temporal views, and not from any real Convictions in their own minds of the truth and excellency of Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf. Nay they would rather &s;u&s;pect that it was the &s;ubtil contrivance of the great Men, to keep the Peo|ple in greater awe, and in more perfect &s;ub|jection to them. So that altho' there might have been more profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, yet there would not have been &s;o many real and hearty ones. And &s;o GOD has &s;hown that <HI>his thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways,</HI> in pitching upon &s;uch as were the mo&s;t unlike|ly of any to carnal rea&s;on at the fir&s;t thought, for this &s;ervice, even Men of an inferiour Rank, who had no advantage of Education, and Learn|ing, or of E&s;tates, or of Authority; and &s;o in &s;hort, nothing in them&s;elves by nature, or birth, or outward circum&s;tances that could recommend them unto the People. Now, I &s;ay, &s;uch were the Men that GOD fir&s;t &s;ent forth to preach the Go&s;pel to the World; and certainly there was a great deal of wi&s;dom &amp; prudence herein.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They were the least likely of any to be &s;u&s;|pected of being about to</HI> impo&s;e a cheat <HI>upon the World.</HI></P>
<P>For none could think that &s;uch Men who had no more advantages of Education, or E&s;tate, or Authority, or Reputation in the World, than a company of Fi&s;her-men, &s;hould undertake to
<PB N="125" REF="002987_0130_0FE6B05B975E8F28">
draw a new Scheme of Religion, full of &s;trange doctrines, out of their own Brains, and think to per&s;wade the World into the belief and practice of it. I &s;ay, no body would ever &s;u&s;pect &s;uch a company of Men to be upon &s;uch a de&s;ign as this. For however &s;trange, and incredible the things they taught might be to the generality of Mankind, yet they would not think but that the&s;e poor Men, who appeared with &s;o much &s;implicity, did believe what they &s;aid them|&s;elves. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The&s;e were the most likely Men to per&s;wade the World that what they taught</HI> came from GOD, <HI>and ought to be received by them.</HI></P>
<P>For, fir&s;t, it would appear very certain to all that con&s;idered it, that the&s;e illiterate Men could not them&s;elves be the Authors of that Religion they preached. Who could ima|gine that Men of no better Education than they, could have drawn up the fulle&s;t, &amp; mo&s;t exact Compendium of all moral Duties; and have given the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and the mo&s;t refined and &s;piritual Notion of all divine moral ver|tues, that ever the World was favour'd with by the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t learned Jew or Heathen!</P>
<P>And then as their circum&s;tances were &s;uch that no body could believe them to be the Au|thors of the Religion they recommended to the World: So it plainly appeared they were not imployed as Tools or In&s;truments by the wi&s;e, and learned, or great Men of that day; becau&s;e the Rulers, and the great Men almo&s;t univer|&s;ally oppo&s;ed, &amp; appeared again&s;t their de&s;igns,
<PB N="126" REF="002987_0131_0FE6B05BAE288F10">
and did all they could to cru&s;h, and overcome them. And then it appears as clearly that they were not &s;et on work by the Devil, becau&s;e what they taught was &s;o directly contrary to his intere&s;t, and tended to the overthrow and de&s;truction of his kingdom. From all which it follows that they received it from GOD; for if they could not be the Authors them&s;elves, nei|ther had they it from Men or Devils, who el&s;e could they receive it from, but GOD him|&s;elf?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The</HI> power of GOD <HI>was more clearly ma|nife&s;ted by the Go&s;pel's prevailing under their Mini&s;try of it, than it would by the Ministry of other Men.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle tells us, 2 Cor. 4.7. <HI>We have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</HI> The more weak the In&s;truments are that GOD makes u&s;e of for the &s;preading his Go&s;pel, and for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, the more is the divine Power magnifyed and made known therein. And therefore GOD made u&s;e of &s;uch Men at fir&s;t in &s;preading the Go&s;pel, to make it evident, that it was not <HI>by the enticing words of Men's wi&s;dom,</HI> that it was not by the Authority or In|fluence of Men, but by his own almighty Power, that the Go&s;pel &s;pread and prevailed as it did, by which means the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves are excluded from all manner of glory|ing or boa&s;ting, becau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of their Mini&s;try. And tho&s;e that experienced, and felt the ble&s;&s;ed effects of the Go&s;pel on their Souls,
<PB N="127" REF="002987_0132_0FE6B05E919071D8">
are led to &s;ee, acknowledge, and adore the al|mighty power and infinite grace of GOD therein.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Wi&s;dom of GOD appeared <HI>in the manner of furni&s;hing, and accompli&s;hing</HI> the A|po&s;tles for the important bu&s;ine&s;s He was &s;end|ing them about.</P>
<P>It is the part of a wi&s;e Man, when he imploys any in his &s;ervice, to &s;ee that they be duely qualifyed, and &s;ufficiently accompli&s;hed for the &s;ervice they are to attend. And thus the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his infinite Wi&s;dom &amp; Prudence, when he &s;ent forth his Apo&s;tles to preach the Go&s;pel, and propagate Chri&s;tianity in all parts of the World; took effectual care that they &s;hould be &s;ufficiently qualifyed, and fitted out for &s;uch weighty and difficult &s;ervice. In|deed he did not furni&s;h them with Silver or Gold or any earthly authority: for the&s;e things would not contribute to the de&s;ign he was &s;end|ing them out upon, which was to &s;et up not an Earthly but a Spiritual Kingdom; and there|fore in&s;tead of tho&s;e, he endowed them with the holy Gho&s;t, in his extraordinary and mira|culous gifts, which at once accompli&s;hed them for their bu&s;ine&s;s. And they were not permitted to depart from Jeru&s;alem before they received the promi&s;e of the Father, <HI>Act.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P>Thus as it was left in charge to them that they &s;hould go and teach all Nations, it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be able to di&s;cour&s;e with each in their own language, &s;o as to be under|&s;tood by them. Accordingly before ever they
<PB N="128" REF="002987_0133_0FE6B05EA78BEAA8">
departed from Jeru&s;alem, <HI>there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and &s;at upon each of them, and they were all filled with the holy Gho&s;t, &amp; began to &s;peak with other tongues,</HI> even in any language what&s;oever. And as there <HI>was of every Nation under Heaven,</HI> at Jeru&s;alem, (which by the way gives us another in&s;tance of divine Wi&s;dom, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e wonderful tran&s;acti|ons with re&s;pect to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &s;hould be at &s;uch a time, and place, where there was a re&s;ort of all Nations, who &s;hould &s;ee and hear of the&s;e matters, the wonderful news of which they doubtle&s;s &s;ent abroad to their re&s;pective Nations, which might prepare them for the more ready receiving of the Go&s;pel when it was &s;ent unto them:) But as I &s;aid, there being of all Nati|ons at Jeru&s;alem, they heard the Apo&s;tles at once &s;peaking to every one in his own parti|cular language: at which they were all ama|zed, knowing that they were <HI>Galileans,</HI> and &s;o had never learned the&s;e language. A parti|cular account of which we may read, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. ch. the beginning. So that there appeared to be a miraculous effu&s;ion of the holy Gho&s;t; which at once not only qualified them for going into the World and teaching every Nation, Tongue and Language; but it al&s;o gave great authority to their Mini&s;try, and was a witne&s;s from Hea|ven for them, that they were going on GOD's Errand, and in a bu&s;ine&s;s that he approved of, and was greatly concerned for.</P>
<P>But yet the alwi&s;e GOD knowing it was not &s;ufficient for the Apo&s;tles in their grand under|taking
<PB N="129" REF="002987_0134_0FE6B06D15D7F310">
to have barely the gift of Tongues: be|cau&s;e altho' they &s;hould be able to &s;peak in every man's tongue; yet if they had not the Spirit to guide them, and to dictate to them what they &s;hould &s;ay, it would have been to little purpo&s;e: This therefore were they endowed with, even the Spirit of truth, or infallibility, to lead and guide them into all truth, as our Saviour had promi&s;ed them <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.13. They had a Spirit of in|fallibility, if not con&s;tantly and in every action, yet upon all nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, to direct them what to do, and dictate to them what to &s;peak: and e&s;pecially when they were about to preach or to write any thing for the u&s;e, and benefit of the Church, they were under the guidance of that Infallible Spirit. For this is the account that one of them gives us in that matter, 1 Cor. 2.13. <HI>Which things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the words which man's wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth.</HI></P>
<P>But then further, GOD knew that the Apo&s;tles having the Spirit of infallibility would not induce People to believe them, unle&s;s they were able to give &s;ome external demon&s;tration of their being &s;ent of GOD. Therefore GOD in his great Wi&s;|dom, and Goodne&s;s, to all the other gifts of the Spirit, added that of working Miracles, in&s;omuch that the Apo&s;tles were able to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Devils, to heal all manner of di&s;ea&s;es, yea and upon occa|&s;ion to rai&s;e the Dead; all which Miracles they did in the name of Chri&s;t, by which they exalted his Name among the People, and gave &s;ufficient rea&s;on for them to believe in him. And thus
<PB N="130" REF="002987_0135_0FE6B06D29673288">
were the Apo&s;tles every way furni&s;hed for the &s;ervice they were imployed in: they were able to &s;peak to every man in his own language to deliver to them the infallible Oracles of GOD, without any error or mi&s;take, and to confirm the &s;ame by divine &s;igns and miracles; which was &s;ufficient to leave any People without excu&s;e, that would not believe their report, nor receive the Go&s;pel which they delivered to them. For &s;urely the&s;e Men &s;poke in the demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with power, a power &s;ufficient to work Conviction in the Minds and Con&s;ciences of men, and not force them contrary to their minds, as the &s;ecular power, and the power of the Sword too often do.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>The</HI> Hard&s;hips and bitter Sufferings, <HI>that GOD ordered out for the Apo&s;tles, and fir&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> was a wi&s;e contrivance for the advancing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the World.</P>

<P>Here it mu&s;t be &s;aid that it was nece&s;&s;ary for the Apo&s;tles to give the &s;tronge&s;t evidence po&s;&s;i|ble that they really believed, yea &amp; that not upon &s;lender grounds, but that they certainly knew the truth of tho&s;e things they taught and urged others to the belief of. They taught the World that Je&s;us of Nazareth was the true Me&s;&s;iah, that he wrought all tho&s;e, (&amp; innumerable more) Mi|racles that are recorded in the Go&s;pel, and that after he was put to death by the Jews, he aro&s;e again from the dead on the third day, and a&s;cended up into Heaven. The&s;e things they declared to be true of their own certain know|ledge. that they were eye-witne&s;&s;es of them. Now the&s;e appeared &s;trange things to the World, and they were with difficulty per&s;uaded to be|lieve them. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary in order to per&s;uade Men into the belief of them, that tho&s;e who related them &s;hould give all po&s;&s;ible demon|&s;tration of their &s;incerity, that they believed and knew the&s;e things to be &s;o. And now what more effectual way could be taken for this than
<PB N="132" REF="002987_0137_0FE6B06E86469140">
by &s;uffering per&s;ecution even unto death, in their witne&s;&s;ing to the truth of what they declared? Surely they could have no temptation to pur&s;ue in declaring tho&s;e things, if they knew them to be forgeries, and lyes, or if they were not fully a&s;&s;ured of the truth of them, &s;ince they had no pro&s;pect of any temporal advantage; but only poverty, whipping, impri&s;onment and death: and had as little rea&s;on to expect any better treat|ment in the other world, if they were guilty of lying and fal&s;hood. For according to their own Doctrines and Principles LIARS were to have their portion in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone forever, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. And there|fore the per&s;ecutions they underwent for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, gave the &s;tronge&s;t demon&s;trations of their &s;incerity and that they really believed and certainly knew the truth of what they &s;uf|fered for. So that altho' it might look like hard and &s;evere treatment from GOD to his Children and Servants, yet GOD was very wi&s;e and pru|dent in &s;uffering the Church to be &s;o &s;everely per&s;ecuted in the former ages of it; for he knew how to uphold and carry his Servants through &s;uch &s;ufferings, with patience and chearfulne&s;s, and he knew how to reward them for it by be|&s;towing a far more exceeding, &amp; eternal weight of glory on them in the other World. And &s;urely it was in infinite mercy to the Church to this very day as it affords a mo&s;t powerful argument for the truth of Chri&s;tianity, by putting that matter beyond all doubt with re&s;pect to the &s;in|cerity of the Apo&s;tles.</P>

<P N="4">(4) Another wi&s;e and good Method that GOD has taken for the propagating, and perpetuating Chri&s;tianity, was <HI>the pre&s;erving the Writings of the Apo&s;tles for the benefit of the Church in all Ages.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Apo&s;tles were not &s;uffered to con|tinue by rea&s;on of Death.

And therefore GOD in
<PB N="135" REF="002987_0140_0FE6B07A74B5E580">
his great Wi&s;dom put it into the Hearts of the Apo&s;tles to commit to Writing the&s;e Sacred Ora|cles of the New-Te&s;tament, guiding them there|in by his Infallible Spirit. The&s;e Scriptures, as well as tho&s;e of the old Te&s;tament, were <HI>given by in&s;pirations of God, &amp; are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction or in&s;truction in righteou&s;|ne&s;s; that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furni&s;hed unto all good works,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

For it is mo&s;t certain that tho&s;e Writings of the Apo&s;tles, the Scriptures of the New Te&s;tament, are under GOD the very &s;upport of the Church, and with|out them it would long before this time have come to nothing.</P>
<P N="5">(5) <HI>The Ordinances of the Go&s;pel</HI> are a wi&s;e contrivance for the pre&s;erving, and upholding the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>GOD de&s;igned that the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hould continue to the end of the World. But here lay a difficulty and danger, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Ages that &s;hould be at a great di&s;tance from the time of Chri&s;ts appearing in the fle&s;h, le&s;t they &s;hould be ready to doubt and disbelieve the facts, and call the whole Religion into que&s;tion:
<PB N="136" REF="002987_0141_0FE6B07A8F8E9310">
As there are too many &s;uch in the World at this day, who call in que&s;tion all revealed Re|ligion. But now Chri&s;t, to prevent our &s;inking into Dei&s;m, and to leave tho&s;e without excu&s;e that do &s;o, did at the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h certain Or|dinances to be continued in his Church, until his &s;econd coming. Thus the Night before he &s;uffered, in&s;tituted the <HI>Sacramental Supper,</HI> to be attended in all Ages of his Church, as a &s;tanding memorial of his Death, until he comes. And al&s;o the Ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> which he in&s;tituted before his A&s;cen&s;ion to be as an Initi|ating Ordinance, and to be performed in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P>And now, if I had time, I could &s;how that the&s;e Ordinances having been kept up in the Church to this day, are mo&s;t convincing argu|ments for the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and leave all without Excu&s;e that wont believe tho&s;e things&punc; which the&s;e Ordinances are, &amp; have been declared all along to be the Monuments and Memorials of; altho' it be for near Seventeen hundred years.

<P N="6"><PB N="137" REF="002987_0142_0FE6B07FAFA1F458">(6.) <HI>The Prophecies of the Go&s;pel</HI> were a wi&s;e contrivance to maintain Chri&s;tianity in the World.</P>
<P>As I have ob&s;erved in a foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, the Prophecies of the old Te&s;tament were wi&s;e|ly contrived, as they &s;erved to point out the Me&s;&s;iah, when he &s;hould appear, &s;o the Pro|phecies of the new Te&s;tament are wi&s;ely con|trived to be of great u&s;e, &amp; benefit for confirm|ing the Truth of Chri&s;tianity.

And con&s;equently that what other things they wrote of at the &s;ame time, were by the In&s;pi|ration of the &s;ame Spirit of Truth: for it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed that GOD would give his Spirit to foretel future Events, to Per&s;ons that would make no other u&s;e of it than to make it a means of impo&s;ing lyes and fal&s;e-hoods upon the World</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="002987_0143_0FE6B07FC9516BF8">And altho' the Church has not as yet received &s;o much benefit by the&s;e Prophecies, becau&s;e of the uncertainty with re&s;pect to the meaning of them; yet they &s;eem to be re&s;erved for pecu|liar u&s;efulne&s;s for the Church in the latter Days: when Dei&s;m &amp; Infidelity &s;hall prevail, and the pre&s;ent arguments made u&s;e of for proving the Truth of Chri&s;tianity be born down by the Corruptions of Men. Then I &s;ay we may conclude that the&s;e Prophecies which have been kept as a re&s;erve, will by their accompli&s;h|ment, and their being more fully under&s;tood, be a powerful means of reviving, and &s;trength|ning the evidences for Chri&s;tianity.</P>

the beginning, is abundantly evident from the Hi&s;tories of it in all Ages.

By the di&s;putes and con|trover&s;ies things were more thoroughly &s;earched, and examined into; which always proves of ad|vantage to that &s;ide which is the Truth.

And now by reading and &s;tudying the Ancient Controver&s;ies of the Church, and their frequent references to the Scriptures of the old, and new Te&s;tament, as now we have them in our Bibles; it appears that the Scriptures that we now have in our hands, were agreed upon by all Parties to be the Word of GOD: which mu&s;t needs afford very great &s;atisfaction to us, and help very much to remove the doubts and &s;cruples that may ari&s;e in our minds about the Scriptures, and convince us,

<DIV3 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>And here I might from the &s;everal In&s;tances of divine Wi&s;dom in the Method of propogating and e&s;tabli&s;hing Chri&s;tianity, draw &s;ome u&s;eful and practical Inferences; but I &s;hall mention only two or three, and &s;o conclude at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Inf. 1. <HI>We ought not to be prejudiced again&s;t any per&s;ons meerly for their external poverty and meanne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>For the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves were poor, and yet Chri&s;t &s;o far honoured them as to make them the Pillars of his Church, &amp; the grand In&s;truments in &s;etting up his Go&s;pel-Kingdom, and their Names &s;hall be handed down with the greate&s;t honour to the late&s;t Po&s;terity. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not be de&s;pi&s;ed, or rejected becau&s;e of their outward Poverty. Let them be ever &s;o mean on out|ward accounts, they mu&s;t be honoured, and re&s;pected as the Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and he that de&s;pi&s;eth them, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent them.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="002987_0146_0FE6B09074A48830">Inf. 2. <HI>Here is ground of Encouragement, that whatever Service GOD calls us unto, he will furni&s;h and qualify us for it.</HI></P>
<P>He did &s;o when he &s;ent forth his Apo&s;tles, he &s;ufficiently qualifyed them for their Office; and therefore whatever Service GOD &s;hall call us unto we have abundant Encouragement to &s;eek to him, to depend upon him for all &s;upplies of Wi&s;dom and Grace, that &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for us. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Wi&s;dom of GOD to call to any Service, and not qualify for it: And therefore if we are but &s;ure that he calls us to the Service, we may &s;afely accept of it in a humble confident dependance upon GOD for his Grace and Spirit that &s;hall be &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us.</P>
<P>Inf. 3. <HI>Outward Afflictions, altho' ever &s;o great, are no certain mark of GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Never any Men endured &s;orer Afflictions than the Apo&s;tles, yet GOD was far from being angry or di&s;plea&s;ed at them: for they were in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay of their duty, in the way that plea&s;ed him; and they were in a peculiar manner hear and dear to Chri&s;t. We mu&s;t not therefore judge of GOD's love or hatred by the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence. For this we are taught by the Preacher, Eccl. 9.1. <HI>No man knoweth either love, or hatred by all that is before him.</HI> Nay, if any way, we &s;hould argue GOD's love from the Af|flictive di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence; for &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Heb. 12.6. <HI>Whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;tneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he re|ceiveth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="002987_0147_0FE6B0908C8F4D30"><HI>To Conclude,</HI> Let us adore the Riches of divine Wi&s;dom in contriving and pro&s;ecuting &s;uch Methods, for the propogating and pre&s;erving the Intere&s;t of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in the World, even unto this day; and the good foundation there is laid for the continuance of it to the end of the World.</P>

<P N="3">3. This Redemption includes the <HI>implanting Principles of Grace and Holine&s;s in our Souls</HI></P>
<P>This Redemption is not only a negative kind of happine&s;s, but it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;omething that is po&s;itive. It contains in it not only the ab&s;ence of &s;in &amp; corruption, but the pre&s;ence of divine Grace. Indeed the ab&s;ence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or a freedom from &s;in, is the pre&s;ence of grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Soul: but yet it affords a di&s;tinct Idea in our minds: as the ab&s;ence of darkne&s;s is the pre&s;ence of light; yet we may form &s;ome di&s;tinct Ideas of them. So here, as the Souls of the Redeemed are freed from the guilt, and power of &s;in, &s;o at the &s;ame time they are endued with principles of grace and holine&s;s: As they are brought out of dark|ne&s;s, &s;o they are brought into marvellous light; <HI>They who were &s;ometimes darkne&s;s, are now made light in the Lord.</HI> Their Under&s;tandings are in|lightned in the knowledge of the Truth: the eyes of their minds opened to behold <HI>won|drous things out of Gods law.</HI> They are enabled to di&s;cern &s;piritual things in a &s;piritual manner. Moreover, the will is renewed: there is a holy gracious temper, and di&s;po&s;ition of Soul formed within them, whereby they are brought to be in love with GOD and Holine&s;s, and to take the greate&s;t delight in his Commandments. More|over the Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;anctifyed and &s;et in order, being put under the Govern|ment of an inlightned and a &s;anctifyed Under|&s;tanding.

And &s;o indeed this redemption in|tends the Sanctification of the whole Man, Spirit, Soul and Body: And that every grace of the ho|ly Spirit be implanted in the Soul. It intends their being endowed with faith, with love and charity, with humility, patience, &s;elf-denyal and every other grace. In &s;hort, the Image of GOD is re&s;tored and reimpre&s;&s;ed upon their Souls; and they are made <HI>Pure as Chri&s;t is pure, and holy as he that has called them is holy:</HI> not in degree, <HI>but in kind.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Our eternal Salvation and Happine&s;s</HI> is con|tained in this redemption that is wrought out for us.</P>
<P>This is not only a temporal but an eternal Redemption. Hence, Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have ob|tained <HI>Eternal Redemption</HI> for us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.12. And he is &s;aid to be <HI>the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him,</HI> Heb. 5.9. Now this in|tends not only an eternal freedom from all &s;in and &s;orrow, the wages of &s;in; but the everla&s;ting fruition of all good and happine&s;s. So that all &s;uch as are redeemed by Chri&s;t, are delivered from the power of Death and the Grave, are ac|quitted in the Day of Judgment, and &s;hall a&s;cend with Chri&s;t to Heaven, and there dwell in his pre&s;ence, where is fulne&s;s of joys, and &s;et down at his right hand, were are rivers of plea&s;ures for evermore; where they partake of &s;uch hap|pine&s;s and glory, that neither Eye hath &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither has it &s;o much as entered into the heart of Man at pre&s;ent to conceive of.

in the exalted Services of their Redeemer in giving ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, glory and power to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I proceed in the next place to &s;how that the working out, and procuring &s;uch a Salvation for us, <HI>was an In&s;tance of wi&s;dom and prudence.</HI></P>
<P>And it is &s;o,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As it is a perfect and compleat</HI> Redemption, and &s;uch an one as <HI>&s;uited the ca&s;e of fallen Man.</HI></P>
<P>Since Chri&s;t had undertaken the great work of our Redemption, it was requi&s;ite for his own vindication, and honour, to procure &s;uch a Salva|tion, as would be &s;uitable for us, and that would be every way &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the end; for otherwi&s;e he would have betray'd his own wi&s;|dom, as not having thorowly con&s;idered our ca&s;e in our fallen State, and what was needful to re&s;tore us to a State of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But now Chri&s;t having wrought out a Salvati|on for us, which is perfect both as to the nature, and degree of it; having &s;aved and delivered us from tho&s;e very things that we needed to be &s;a|ved from, and to &s;uch a degree as we &s;tood in need of Salvation, &s;howed a great deal of Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Men are &s;ometimes ready to do another a kindne&s;s, and to help him out of his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; but for want of prudence and di&s;creti|on, they oftentimes mi&s;s their aim, and what they do to help him, oftentimes proves not only ineffectual, but hurtful and prejudicial to him. But now GOD di&s;covers his wi&s;dom and di&s;|cretion, in a due con&s;ideration of our fallen cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="149" REF="002987_0154_0FE6B0ADEA999808">
and of all our wants and nece&s;&s;ities, and in procuring &s;uch a Salvation as would relieve us under them all. He wi&s;ely con&s;idered how we had expo&s;ed our &s;elves to mi&s;ery, and de&s;truction by our Sins; He accordingly took care to find out a ran&s;om for our Sin, whereby we might be delivered from the cur&s;e of the law, and &s;aved from the wrath to come, to which our Sins had expo&s;ed us. Furthermore, He con&s;idered how we had in&s;laved our natures by Sin, and brought our &s;elves under bondage to our lu&s;ts and cor|ruptions, and contracted &s;uch a temper, as would incline us to a perpetual black&s;liding; and that therefore it would be to no purpo&s;e to pardon our Sins, unle&s;s he found out a way at the &s;ame time to cure us of our &s;trong propen&s;ions and inclina|tions to it, and &s;o prevent <HI>our returning again to folly after God had &s;poken peace unto us.</HI> He has therefore in his great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, at the &s;ame time that he made way for our being pardoned and ju&s;tified; taken effectual care that we &s;hould be renewed and &s;anctified, the &s;inful di&s;po&s;itions within us &s;ubdued and mortified, &s;o as that we may be not only kept back from pre|&s;umptuous Sins, but from the indulgence of any Sin, and then &s;erve GOD in holine&s;s and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s for the time to come.</P>
<P>So again, as in our original make and con&s;titu|tion, we were capable of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ed GOD him&s;elf in the &s;weete&s;t fellow&s;hip &amp; com|munion with him in this World, and in the near|e&s;t and mo&s;t immediate communion with him in the World to come: and con&s;equently we mu&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="002987_0155_0FE6B0AE0409C488">
be unhappy, unle&s;s we are re&s;tored to this un|&s;peakable priviledge. This therefore has GOD in his great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s taken care of, that we &s;hould be freed not only from hell and de&s;truction, and from the reigning power of Sin, but that we &s;hould have &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of grace and holine&s;s upon our hearts, &s;uch a love of GOD and Chri&s;t, delight in him, and likene&s;s to him; as &s;hould fit us for communion with him here, and the enjoyment of him hereafter.</P>
<P>So that in &s;hort, Chri&s;t has &s;o fully con&s;idered our ca&s;e, that the Redemption he has purcha&s;ed is what exactly &s;uits our circum&s;tances: It re|moves all the evils we had involved our &s;elves in by Sin; and brings us into as happy, if not a more happy &s;tate than if mankind had never &s;in|ned. And &s;urely &s;o bring as much good out of &s;o much evil is certainly an in&s;tance of wonder|ful wi&s;dom. But then</P>
<P N="2">2. It is an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, as it is &s;uch a Redemption that &s;erves very much <HI>to &s;et forth the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>As was ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon tho&s;e words, <HI>Wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing the mo&s;t noble Ends, and in pur&s;uing the mo&s;t proper means to accompli&s;h the &s;ame.</HI> Now the Glory of GOD is a de&s;ign worthy of GOD him&s;elf, and the highe&s;t end he can propo&s;e, and con&s;equently every Method GOD takes that is effectual to promote this, is an in&s;tance of wi&s;dom in him. Now the Redemption that Chri&s;t has purcha|&s;ed, and wrought out for us is of &s;uch a nature that it directly tends to advance the Glory of GOD, and that in two ways.</P>

<P>The nature and degree of this Redemption is &s;uch that &s;eparate from our Unworthine&s;s of it, and &s;eparate from the infinite co&s;t and pains GOD was at to accompli&s;h it; I &s;ay, the nature of it is &s;uch, that exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, it di&s;covers wonderful goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s in GOD. For it is certain that an infinite favour and benefit is be&s;towed upon all that are the &s;ubjects of it. For this Redemption is &s;o great, and &s;o &s;uited to our natures and nece&s;&s;ities, that it affords a compleat, and perfect happine&s;s unto us; a happine&s;s as great as we can de&s;ire, or are capable of enjoying. We had undone our &s;elves, we had corrupted, defiled and degraded our natures, and made our &s;elves more vile than the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, and more mi&s;erable too: for we had lo&s;t the divine Image; had forfeited the divine Favour, and had expo&s;ed our&s;elves to the revenging Ju&s;tice of GOD, &amp; &s;o to all the torment &amp; mi&s;ery that our natures were capable of enduring. Now the Redemption wrought out for us implies a delivering us

from all the&s;e evils; and not only &s;o, but the putting us into a far more glorious and happy &s;tate than we were in, before the fall. Which &s;erves to illu&s;trate the immen&s;e goodne&s;s, and infinite mercy of GOD unto us. What a won|derful di&s;play of divine goodne&s;s is it to acquit Men from the guilt&punc; and &s;ave them from the puni&s;hment of Sin? How bright and glorious does the divine pity and compa&s;&s;ion appear, in freeing Men from the &s;lavery and bondage they are in by nature to their lu&s;ts &amp; corruptions; in re&s;cuing them out of the hands of Satan, and tran&s;lating them out of the kingdom of darkne&s;s, into the kingdom of GOD? How abundant in goodne&s;s, and how rich in Mercy does GOD ap|pear to be, in delivering us from the pit of ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery &amp; de&s;truction, from the place that burns with fire &amp; brim&s;tone, and where is weep|ing and wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth for ever; and in opening the gates of Heaven to us and gi|ving us an abundant entrance into his everla&s;ting Kingdom, where is fulne&s;s of joy and rivers of plea&s;ure for evermore?

<P>In the Redemption of Sinners, there is, the con|verting &amp; turning them <HI>from darkne&s;s to light; and tran&s;lating them out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of the Son of GOD.</HI> Which change requires no le&s;s than Almighty power to accompli&s;h it.

Fur|thermore, this is the di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and driving out the Devil, the &s;trong man armed who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Souls; there is a conquering and over-coming Principalities and Powers, and the rulers of the darkne&s;s of the world; who do their utmo&s;t to ob&s;truct and hinder our Conver|&s;ion. In &s;hort, in our Redemption there is a Re|generation, or new Birth. Hence we are &s;aid, <HI>to be born again,</HI> Joh. 3.3. There is al&s;o a Re&s;ur|rection to life.

<P N="3">3. This Redemption is of &s;uch a nature as &s;erves to &s;et forth the glory of <HI>divine Holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If the Redemption wrought out for us had con&s;i&s;ted only in the pardon of Sin, a Re&s;toration to the divine Favour, and a delivery from Hell and Mi&s;ery, while the natural propen&s;ions and inclinations to Sin remain'd within; we and all the rational Creation &s;hould have been ready to doubt of the infinite Purity and Holine&s;s of the divine Nature. For how could any have thought that GOD bore &s;uch an infinite hatred again&s;t Sin, if he &s;hould have forgiven Sinners, and been reconciled to them, at peace with them, while their love to Sin, and aver&s;ion to all that is good and holy remained in them. But now GOD's taking care to free us from the power of Sin, from our love to it, and delight in it, as well as from the guilt and puni&s;hment of it, is a &s;ufficient vin|dication
<PB N="155" REF="002987_0160_0FE6B0BFF4C85058">
of the divine Holine&s;s. GOD takes care that all &s;uch as are <HI>Ju&s;tified freely by his Grace,</HI> are al&s;o <HI>renewed and &s;anctified by his Spirit.</HI> When he clean&s;es us from the guilt of Sin, he clean&s;es us <HI>from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit</HI>; and is by degrees perfecting us in holine&s;s: which &s;hows how high a regard GOD has for holine&s;s, and what a hatred and abhorrence he bears to all im|purity.

<P N="2">2. The nature of our Redemption is &s;uch, as tends much to the glory of GOD; <HI>Ina&s;much as it di&s;po&s;es and enables the Redeemed to give Glory to Him in an Active way and manner.</HI></P>
<P>Had GOD only pardoned our Sins, and relea&s;ed us from puni&s;hment, and if we had after that remained under the power of Sin and Lu&s;t; in|&s;tead of giving Glory to GOD for &s;uch an un|&s;peakable Mercy, as the delivering us from de|&s;truction and mi&s;ery: we &s;hould take encourage|ment to go on yet further in our rebellions again&s;t him, we &s;hould be more daring and pre&s;umptuous, and do more than ever to di&s;honour and di&s;plea&s;e that GOD that had forgiven us our former tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es again&s;t him; and &s;o in&s;tead of adoring and prai&s;ing him for his infinite Mercy and Grace, we &s;hould rather in&s;ult him as being <HI>altogether

&s;uch an one as our &s;elves.</HI> But now as they that are redeemed from the puni&s;hment of Sin, are renewed al&s;o in the &s;pirit of their minds, and are transformed into the divine Image, &s;o they have &s;uch a temper and frame of &s;pirit, which di&s;po&s;es them to give unto GOD the Glory due unto his Name, and to &s;hew forth his prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>The Redemption wrought out for Sinners is of &s;uch a nature, That it gives us the brighte&s;t di&s;co|veries of the excellencies and perfections of the divine Being, and &s;o &s;erves to fill us with the mo&s;t exalted thoughts, and adoring apprehen&s;ions of him. By this Redemption we have a more con|vincing &s;en&s;e of our dependance upon him, and that all we receive comes from him. He that is Redeemed is made &s;en&s;ible of his infinite Obliga|tions to GOD, not only for the outward Mercies that he daily receives; but for his redeeming love and grace that has been manife&s;ted towards him. And that very temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind which is wrought in him by Redemption, and which is part of his Redemption; fills him with the highe&s;t love &amp; gratitude to GOD &amp; awakens his Soul, and all within him to ble&s;s and prai&s;e his holy Name, and excites gracious purpo&s;es, and endeavours to ble&s;s the LORD whil&s;t he lives, and to give thanks unto him whil&s;t he has any Being, nay, and not only to &s;peak, but to live GOD's prai&s;es by being devoted to the Fear and Service of GOD, and imployed for his honour. But then further, this Redemption di&s;po&s;es and enables not only to live a life of prai&s;e in this

Hence, we find them repre&s;ented, as <HI>falling down before the Lamb, &s;inging a new &s;ong, &s;aying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the &s;eals of it: for thou wa&s;t &s;lain and ha&s;t re|deemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue, and people, and nation.

Surely we &s;hould ble&s;s the <HI>Lord God of I&s;rael, who hath thus vi&s;ited and redeemed his people.</HI></P>
<P>Inf. 2. <HI>We &s;ee an in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perable Connection be|tween a Pardoned and Regenerate state here, and a Glorified &s;tate hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>This is the con&s;tant and &s;tated rule of Chri&s;t in our Redemption, that <HI>whom he calls, them he ju&s;tifies, and whom the ju&s;tifies, them he al&s;o glori|fies,</HI> Rom. 8.30. So that none can be par|doned and &s;aved from the guilt and puni&s;h|ment of Sin, or received to Heaven at la&s;t; but &s;uch as have been effectually called out of darkne&s;s into marvellous light, out of a &s;tate of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure into a &s;tate of Grace. A thorow Con|ver&s;ion to GOD, and a pardoned &s;tate are in&s;e|parable concomitants: GOD has joyned them together; and we cant put them a &s;under.

and brought to a true Repentance for Sin, and to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For it is impo&s;&s;ible from the nature of GOD, and from the tenor of the Covenant of Grace that we are under, for a Man in an Unregenerate, Uncon|verted e&s;tate, to be pardoned and reconciled to GOD. So that all &s;uch as look upon them|&s;elves in a &s;tate of Peace &amp; Reconciliation with GOD, and have never experienced a gracious Change in their hearts, do mi&s;erably deceive them&s;elves, they cry Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace. <HI>For there is,</HI> there can be <HI>no Peace, &s;ays my God, to the wicked,</HI> I&s;ai. 57.1.</P>
<P>Inf. 3. <HI>How much does it concern us all to have this very Redemption in all its parts applied unto us!</HI></P>
<P>More Men are willing to have this Redemp|tion, in part applyed to them; but not in the full extent &amp; latitude of it. They are willing to have their Sins pardoned, and to be &s;aved from Hell, and the wrath to come; to go to Heaven, and obtain eternal Life and Happine&s;s when they die. But then as e&s;&s;ential a part of this Redemption as any, they are not de&s;irous of, nor concerned about: nay, they had rather be with|out it, <HI>viz.</HI> A Redemption from the <HI>power of Indwelling Sin &amp; Corruption, and from the power of all their &s;piritual Enemies.</HI> They are content to live in their Sins; and the &s;lavery they are in to their Lu&s;ts, is no burden to them: they are ea&s;y and quiet while they are the captives of Satan, and are led away by him at his plea|&s;ure; nay, they delight in Sin, and roll it as a

<P N="14">XIV. <HI>THE</HI> MANNER <HI>of</HI> APPLYING <HI>this Redemption to any of the Children of Men,</HI> is another In&s;tance of wonderful Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>I have in &s;ome former di&s;cour&s;es, &s;hewn how the Wi&s;dom of GOD was manife&s;ted in the way and method that was taken for purcha&s;ing and procuring Redemption for us; and &s;o bring|ing us into a &s;tate of Salvation by a Redeemer, I am now to con&s;ider the manner of Applying this Redemption to us which opens another Scene of amazing Wi&s;dom &amp; Prudence in GOD. It is not only nece&s;&s;ary that Redemption &s;hould
<PB N="162" REF="002987_0167_0FE6B0DB108998C8">
be purcha&s;ed for us: but that it &s;hould be al&s;o Applyed unto us. And now as there was in the purcha&s;ing and procuring; &s;o is there in the Ap|plying this Redemption, a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence. Which will appear by a di&s;tinct con&s;ideration of the &s;everal <HI>Parts</HI> of Redemption; &s;uch as Ju&s;tification, Regeneration and Sanctifica|tion, and eternal Salvation and Happine&s;s at la&s;t; and the <HI>Manner</HI> how they are applyed to us, and we made the Partakers of them.</P>
<P>But before I do this, I would briefly ob&s;erve in general, <HI>by or from whom</HI> we receive this Redemp|tion, who is the Author of it, and by whom we come to receive it.</P>
<P>Now all the &s;aving benefits of Redemption come <HI>originally from the Father, thro' the Merits &amp; In|terce&s;&s;ion of the Son, by the Agency &amp; Operation of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, <HI>The Father</HI> is to be con&s;idered as the <HI>Fountain</HI> of all &s;aving Grace and Mercy that is ever conveyed to the Sinner. Free and Sove|reign Grace and Mercy is to be con&s;idered as flowing originally from him. Hence, he is called the Father of Mercies, and the GOD of all Com|fort, and &s;o of all Grace, 2 Cor. 1.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God even the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort.</HI> And he even the Father is &s;aid to have <HI>ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places:</HI> As in the 3 d. ver&s;e of the context.</P>
<P>But then Secondly, The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are <HI>purcha|&s;ed and procured by Chri&s;t the Son of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>He has purcha&s;ed them for us by his Obedience
<PB N="163" REF="002987_0168_0FE6B0DE8615A1E8">
and Death. Hence we are &s;aid to <HI>have Redemp|tion thro' his blood, the forgivene&s;s of our Sins, according to the riches of his Grace.</HI> In the ver&s;e immediately preceeding the Text. And we are &s;aid to be <HI>Ju&s;tified freely by his Grace,</HI> (the Grace of GOD) <HI>thro' the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. 3.24. And the <HI>Church is &s;aid to be purcha&s;ed,</HI> or redeemed <HI>with his blood,</HI> Act. 20.28. But then he actually procures and draws forth the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings by his Interce&s;&s;ion. For &s;ince his A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven, he appears in the pre&s;ence of GOD for us pleading the Merits of his Obe|dience and Sufferings, in our behalf. So that whatever Mercy or Grace is be&s;towed on us, it is by vertue of his prevailing Interce&s;&s;ion. Hence he is &s;aid to <HI>be able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t tho&s;e that come unto God thro' him, &s;eeing he ever lives to make incerce&s;&s;ion for them,</HI> Heb. 7.25.</P>
<P>But then Thirdly, <HI>Whatever benefits Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed or does procure for us, they are applyed or conveyed to us by the hand of the holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t when he was about to leave the World, tells his Di&s;ciples that he would pray the Father, and he would &s;end them another comforter, that &s;hould abide with them for ever; even the &s;pirit of truth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.16, 17. And a&s;&s;ures them that when he is come he will reprove the world of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of Judgment, 16.8. Now the holy Gho&s;t being &s;ent into the world, is the prime Mini&s;ter, or Agent in Chri&s;t's Kingdom to carry on his work among Men; and to apply to them the benefits that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for them. HE it is that works all true and &s;aving
<PB N="164" REF="002987_0169_0FE6B0DE9CE771D0">
Grace in the Soul. Hence he is called <HI>the Spirit of Grace,</HI> Heb. 10.29. He it is al&s;o that applies all true comfort, and the joy of GOD's Salvati|on. Hence, he is called the <HI>Comforter,</HI> Joh. 16.7. He it is that <HI>Helps our Infirmities,</HI> Rom. 8.26. And the <HI>Love of God</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>be &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is given unto us,</HI> Rom. 5.5. And every Vertue and Grace is &s;aid to be the fruit of the Spirit, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.22, 23. That is, the effect of the Spirit, <HI>what is</HI> wrought in us by the Spirit of GOD.</P>
<P>And thus we &s;ee that all the Per&s;ons in the &s;a|cred Trinity had a hand in carrying on the grand affair of our Redemption; which is &s;uch an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom as helps very much to confirm the doctrine before us: for as the Three that bear re|cord in Heaven are equal in power and glory; &s;o it is a wi&s;e contrivance to have each of them &s;o concerned in every affair that brings any glory to GOD, as that they &s;hould be equal Partners in the glory; and now as there is great glory accruing to GOD by the wonderful work of our Redemp|tion, &s;o each Per&s;on in the God-head by having a hand in the work will have a &s;hare in the glory. By this means there is glory to the Father, to the Son, and to the holy Gho&s;t. The glorious per|fections of each Per&s;on are magnified &amp; honoured hereby; and Angels and Saints give glory to them. Hereby they are moved to give glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> GOD the Father as the Father of Lights, and the Fountain of all Grace &amp; Mercy; from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift de&s;cends. And to &s;ay as in the afore-mentioned, Eph. 1.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="165" REF="002987_0170_0FE6B0E749BCE798">
be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> Hereby they will be moved al&s;o to give glory to the Son of GOD, and to &s;ay, as in Rev. 5.12, 13. <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain to receive power, and riches, and wi&s;dom, and &s;trength, and honour, and glory &amp; ble&s;&s;ing. Ble&s;&s;ing and honour and glory, and power be to him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</HI> Hereby they will be moved al&s;o to give glory to the di|vine Spirit for working divine &amp; heavenly Grace within them, acknowledging it to be by the grace of GOD, and the almighty influences of the holy Spirit, that <HI>they are what they are.</HI> Acknowledging that their New-Birth, by which they are fitted to enter into the Kingdom of GOD, has been by the holy Spirit, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.5.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly con&s;idered by whom this Redemption is be&s;towed on us. I proceed now to that which I more e&s;pecially intended to in&s;i&s;t upon, <HI>viz.</HI> The con&s;ideration of the &s;everal parts of Redemption, and the manner of their being applyed to us, and &s;o as I go along, take notice of the divine Wi&s;dom and Prudence that di&s;covers it &s;elf therein.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall divide or di&s;tingui&s;h the Re|demption of a Sinner into the&s;e general parts, <HI>viz.</HI> Redemption, Regeneration and Sanctification, and his future Glorification or Happine&s;s in Heaven; and &s;hall con&s;ider the manner how each of the&s;e are applyed to the Sinner, and how the Wi&s;dom of GOD abounds herein. Here then,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="166" REF="002987_0171_0FE6B0E75DA003D0">1. <HI>In the</HI> JUSTIFICATION <HI>of a Sinner,</HI> there appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tification of a Sinner is his being par|doned and forgiven; his being acquitted and de|livered from the guilt and puni&s;hment of &s;in, his being accepted as Righteous in the Sight of GOD; his being re&s;tored to the divine favour, and intitled to eternal Life and Happine&s;s: all which is upon the account of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s be|ing imputed to us, and received by Faith.</P>
<P>Now the Wi&s;dom of GOD in applying this part of Redemption to a Sinner, appears in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the cau&s;e, matter and foundation of the Sinners Ju&s;tification, <HI>which is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In the qualifications required, and made nece&s;&s;ary in order to our Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>cau&s;e and foundation</HI> upon which GOD ever Ju&s;tifies a Sinner; which is the <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to them,</HI> di&s;covers a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>For the Illu&s;tration of this head, I &s;hall &s;ay he&s;e things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. With the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>there is a per|fect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Ju&s;tification of a Sinner is upon the ac|count of <HI>this</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s being <HI>Imputed</HI> to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the <HI>Imputation</HI> of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, there appears a great deal of <HI>Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>With the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t there is a</HI> perfect <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="002987_0172_0FE6B0EBD6BD5D88">Indeed there is a twofold Righteou&s;ne&s;s with Chri&s;t.

He is a Righteous LORD</HI>: and <HI>an Holy GOD, a GOD of Truth and without Iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI> But then if we con&s;ider him as GOD-Man Mediator, and there is a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith him. And this is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is here intend|ed; for it is by vertue of this Mediatorial Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, that a Sinner is ever Ju&s;tified. And that there was a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s with Chri&s;t as Mediator, appears, in that he was perfectly freed from the taint of Original Sin, being con|ceived in a miraculous manner, by the over-&s;had|dowing of the holy Gho&s;t. Hence he is called, <HI>that holy thing,</HI> Luk 1.35. And in that, He did, as he &s;aid, <HI>it became him to fulfill all Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in the cour&s;e of his Life, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.15.

In&s;omuch that altho' the&s;e &s;ufferings were but temporary, and of but &s;hort continuance, yet con&s;idering the dignity of the Per&s;on, and how infinitely near and dear he was to GOD, and con&s;idering al&s;o the nature of his Sufferings; and they are equivalent to our Suffering an eternal death (as has been &s;hown at large in one of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;es) and &s;o wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a full Satisfaction for &s;in. The debt con|tracted was hereby paid to the utmo&s;t farthing: and &s;o GOD con&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, could be reconciled to the repenting and believing Sinner.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is by the <HI>active Obedience</HI> of Chri&s;t, that there is &s;uch a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought out for us.</P>
<P>In order to Chri&s;ts having a perfect Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, it was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a per|fect Conformity to the Precepts of the law, as well as an enduring the penalties of it: for with|out this his &s;ufferings mu&s;t have been upon his own account; for his own Sin as the high Prie&s;ts of old, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.27. Could not be Meritorious for us. Or if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e any Merit in his Sufferings, whereby the Sinner might have been &s;aved from eternal death and de&s;truction, yet there would not have been wherewith to have purcha&s;ed eternal life &amp; happine&s;s: and &s;o all the
<PB N="169" REF="002987_0174_0FE6B0F6F248B610">
Salvation procured by the meer &s;uffering the pe|nalty of the law, would have been only negative. And therefore cho&s;e to make him&s;elf a compleat Saviour, and to purcha&s;e a po&s;itive as well as a negative happine&s;s, to bring us to Heaven, as well as deliver us from Hell, has performed a perfect Obedience to the whole law of GOD. Hence it is &s;aid of him, 1 Pet. 2.22. <HI>That he did no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth.</HI> And that he was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled &s;eparate from Sinners, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.26. And hence he him&s;elf could &s;ay to his Father, as in Joh. 17.4. <HI>I have glorified thee on earth, and fini&s;hed the work which thou ga|ve&s;t me to do.</HI> And hence the Father could give this Te&s;timony of him once and again from Hea|ven, as in Math. 3.17.17.5. <HI>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> Which could not be &s;aid in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, if he had not <HI>fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and always done <HI>tho&s;e things that plea&s;e the Father.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Ju&s;tification of a Sinner is by the</HI> Impu|tation <HI>of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t unto him.</HI></P>
<P>That is, when a Sinner is pardoned &amp; acquitted from the condemning Sentence of the divine Law, re&s;tored to the divine Favour, and intitled to e|ternal Life; it is upon the account of the Merits of Chri&s;ts Obedience and death accepted for him. Chri&s;t undertook the Office of a Mediator between GOD &amp; us, and became a &s;urety for us. Accor|dingly, all that he did and &s;uffered was upon our account, in our room and &s;tead, and GOD ac|cepts of it upon the account of all tho&s;e that be|lieve in Chri&s;t, and obey his Go&s;pel. GOD ac|cepts
<PB N="170" REF="002987_0175_0FE6B0F70A208780">
of it on their account &s;o far, as to be recon|ciled to them, and to treat them with as much kindne&s;s and re&s;pect, and to be&s;tow as great fa|vours and ble&s;&s;ings upon them, as if they them|&s;elves had per&s;onally &s;uffered the penalties of the law, and &s;atisfied the demands of Ju&s;tice, and had al&s;o yielded a perfect Obedience to the law. And now when GOD treats a per&s;on after this manner, he may be &s;aid to ju&s;tify him: and his doing it upon the account of what Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered in our &s;tead, is the Imputation of his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s unto us. For GOD, by ju&s;tifying a Sinner upon the account of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, does &s;o far impute the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to the Sinner, that to all intents and purpo&s;es it is his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. That is, he receives as much benefit by it, as if it had been his own per&s;onal Righteou&s;ne&s;s. GOD is as much at Peace with him and as propitious to him, as if he had wrought out a Righteou&s;ne&s;s him&s;elf, becau&s;e of the Righ|teous of Chri&s;t: and this is what we are to un|der&s;tand by the Imputation of it.</P>
<P>And now that this is the way of a Sinners Ju&s;ti|fication, is evident from the word of GOD, where the Doctrine of a Sinners Ju&s;tification by Je&s;us Chri&s;t is taught, and no where el&s;e. And there we are taught, That what Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered was upon our account. Thus it was Prophe&s;ied of him, That <HI>he &s;hould be wounded for our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our Iniquities. That he &s;hould make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, and bear the &s;ins of many,</HI> I&s;ai. 53 5, 10.12. Accordingly, &s;ince his coming into the World, he is &s;aid to <HI>have

<P N="3">3. In the Imputation of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, there is a great deal of <HI>Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Ina&s;much as GOD has pitched upon the <HI>only &s;uitable and &s;ufficient</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that could be Imputed to us for our Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>It is certainly a point of Wi&s;dom, to make choice of, and pitch upon what may be &s;uitable and &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed. Now the End propo&s;ed was the Ju&s;tification of a Sin|ner, by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of another unto him. And now what Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;o proper, &s;o &s;uitable, and that could an&s;wer the End &s;o effectually as the Mediatorial Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? As for the Infinite Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of GOD, and which is E&s;&s;ential to the divine Nature, it is Incommunicable, and &s;o can't be Imputed to any Creature for its Ju&s;tification. So that notwith&s;tanding any thing that could be done as to the transferring of that Infinite Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to us, we mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for ever.
<PB N="173" REF="002987_0178_0FE6B10769030DD0">
Nay, this E&s;&s;ential Ju&s;tice of the divine Nature would have inclined and obliged GOD to puni&s;h us for ever.</P>
<P>And then as for any Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own, <HI>That</HI> would by no means have an&s;wered for our Ju&s;tification before GOD: for as the Prophet &s;ays, I&s;ai. 64.6. <HI>All our Righteou&s;ne&s;s are as filthy Rags.</HI> Our Righteou&s;ne&s;s is altogether imperfect, attended with innumerable Infirmities and Sins: and if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that we were able now to perform a perfect Obedience; yet that would by no means be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify us, becau&s;e it could not &s;atisfie for our former Violations of GOD's Law. And then again, if we con&s;ider the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the holy Angels, and we &s;hall find the incapacity and in&s;ufficiency of it to &s;atisfie for our offences, if it was imputed to us. For altho' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Angels is per|fect in its kind, and is &s;ufficient for them&s;elves; yet there can't be the lea&s;t Merit in it: all their Righteou&s;ne&s;s is no more than they owe to GOD their Maker and Pre&s;erver, and therefore it could not in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure &s;atisfy for our guilt. But now as for the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t wrought out by his active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, it was infinitely Meritorious, becau&s;e his Obedi|ence and &s;ufferings were what he did not owe to GOD for him&s;elf: And now this was the only Righteou&s;ne&s;s that could be Imputed to us, that could be of any &s;ervice, or that could an&s;wer the End for our Ju&s;tification. And therefore the di|vine Wi&s;dom &amp; Prudence appears in fixing upon this Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to be imputed to the Sinner for his Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="174" REF="002987_0179_0FE6B10781799BF8">2. There is Wi&s;dom, ina&s;much as GOD by <HI>the &s;ame act, magnifies his Justice, and his Grace.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has contrived the Ju&s;ification of a Sin|ner in &s;uch a manner, that he makes both his Ju&s;tice, and his Mercy to appear very glorious in it. It is certain that the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner is an act of free and &s;overeign Grace; and GOD does in &s;uch in act &s;how him&s;elf to be abundant in Mercy and rich in Grace. And in|deed how could GOD &s;how him&s;elf more Mer|ciful and Gracious than in pardoning the &s;ins and rebellions of his Creatures, who were un|der infinite obligations to obey and &s;erve him, and in receiving them into &s;pecial favour, and intitling them to eternal Life and Happine&s;s, who contrary to all their obligations in point of duty, gratitude, or intere&s;t, have ri&s;en up again&s;t him, and done all they could to di&s;honour and provoke him? But then at the &s;ame time, and by the &s;ame act that he di&s;plays his &s;overeign Grace, he al&s;o makes very glorious manife&s;tati|ons of his infinite and inflexible Ju&s;tice: and that becau&s;e he receives full &s;atisfaction for every &s;in he pardons. When GOD forgives our debts, yet he &s;hows that he is very ju&s;t to him|&s;elf, in that he won't do it till the debt be paid by our Surety to the utmo&s;t farthing. And al|tho' eternal Life to which Believers are inti|tled, is the free <HI>gift of God</HI>; yet it is an act of Ju&s;tice, becau&s;e it is fairly purcha&s;ed for them by Chri&s;t; even by his mo&s;t perfect, and meri|torious Obedience. So that when GOD is di&s;|covering boundle&s;s riches of Grace to us in our

Pardon and Ju&s;tification: he &s;hows that he is infinitely Ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and won't in the lea&s;t abate of his right, nor give up any thing that is his due: That altho' he is willing to &s;ave us, yet that he is as careful not to wrong or injure him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon &s;etting forth the Wi&s;dom of GOD in this matter; becau&s;e I have prevented my &s;elf by what has been &s;aid under &s;ome of the foregoing In&s;tances of divine Wi&s;dom: as particularly, that of GOD's in&s;i&s;ting <HI>upon a &s;atisfaction for &s;in, before he would pardon the &s;inner</HI>: And that, <HI>of Appointing his own Son to be the Mediator,</HI> who was able, and who ac|cordingly has made full Satisfaction for &s;in. Neither &s;hall I at pre&s;ent, proceed to con&s;ider the Qualifications GOD requires &amp; be&s;tows in order to our Ju&s;tification, and the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein: but leaving the Con&s;ideration hereof to the afternoon; I &s;hall conclude, at pre&s;ent with &s;ome <HI>Improvement</HI> of what has been &s;aid. And here,</P>
<P>Inf. 1. From what we have heard in the for|mer part of this di&s;cour&s;e, we learn, <HI>How careful we &s;hould be to acknowledge and adore each Per&s;on of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, in the Affair of our Re|demption.</HI></P>
<P>For each Per&s;on is concerned in carrying on this grand Affair, and therefore they ought all to be &s;uitably acknowledged and adored by us. This is part of the glory that was propo&s;ed by them, in having a hand in this &s;tupendous work;
<PB N="176" REF="002987_0181_0FE6B1090F54BA78">
even to receive the acknowledgments and ado|rations of the Redeemed: (as we have already hinted) Surely then we ought to give to each Per&s;on the glory due unto his Name upon the account hereof. GOD has taken care that they &s;hould be acknowledged and adored by us, in commanding every one to be Baptized <HI>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Matth. 28.19. And by the form of &s;olemn Benediction left us by the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. 13.14. <HI>The Grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Gho&s;t be with you all.</HI> We &s;hould therefore con&s;ider them in their &s;everal ways of working, and acknow|ledge them in &s;uch acts of wor&s;hip and adora|tion, as is &s;uitable to them. Thus we mu&s;t direct our Prayers, our Prai&s;es, and all acts of religious Wor&s;hip, to the Father, in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son, by the help of the Holy Spirit: believing that no duty can find acceptance with GOD, but thro' the Merits &amp; Mediation of the Son; and that no Duty can be performed, &s;o as any way to be accepted, but what is done by the help of the Holy Spirit. For this we are taught, not only that our <HI>Spiritual Sacrifices are accepta|ble to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5. But <HI>that the Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infirmities,</HI> Rom. 8.26.</P>

they always go together. He that &s;incerely and heartily depends upon the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t for Ju&s;tification, will be clothed with it: for this Righteou&s;ne&s;s is received by faith. And &s;eeing it is &s;uch a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch mu&s;t needs be in a very &s;afe condition that are intere&s;ted in it: What need &s;uch be afraid, that have the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to cloth and cover them?

Surely the Merits of his blood are &s;ufficient to make Atonement for the greate&s;t Sins, and &s;ecure the chiefe&s;t Sinner from all Condemnation. And it is certain, that his Obedience was &s;o per|fect, and his Mediatorial Holine&s;s &s;o &s;potle&s;s; that if it be but imputed to the vile&s;t Sinner, he can't but be accepted of GOD, and intitled to eternal Life. So that there is ab&s;olute perfect &s;afety to all them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that are found clothed with his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that Ju&s;tifieth Who is he that condem|neth? it is Chri&s;t that died, yea, rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us,</HI> Rom. 8.33, 34. What Chri&s;t has done, and &s;uffered is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice; and &s;ince GOD is plea|&s;ed to accept of the &s;atisfaction he has made, in behalf of all that believe in him; it is impo&s;&s;ible for any &s;uch to peri&s;h. Wherefore let &s;uch as are

<P>Inf. 3. We learn the <HI>&s;ad condition of tho&s;e, who have not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Christ imputed, and made-over to them.</HI></P>
<P>For if the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner be only by the Imputation of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; then &s;uch as have not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t made over to them, are not Ju&s;tified, but are yet in their Sins; the guilt of Sin, and &s;o the wrath of GOD abideth on them, and they are every Moment in danger of dropping into the burning Lake: for they have nothing to &s;ecure, or &s;ave them from it. As for any Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of their own, it is all but as filthy Rags; it can't hide their &s;hame nor cover their Nakedne&s;s: it can't recommend them to the favour of GOD, nor intitle them to any ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s. So that notwith&s;tanding all their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they are wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor and blind, and naked: they mu&s;t an&s;wer for them&s;elves, and &s;o mu&s;t bear the puni&s;hment of their own Iniquity, in the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, where is weeping and wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth for ever.</P>
<P>Inf. 4. And to conclude, <HI>Let us all with utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;eek after this mo&s;t perfect Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, to be Imputed to us, that we might be Ju&s;tifyed and Saved thereby.</HI></P>

But yet this does not &s;uppo&s;e that we apprehend our ca&s;e to be de&s;perate &amp; remedi|le&s;s; but on the contrary, it &s;uppo&s;es that we have a &s;en&s;e of the infinite Mercy of GOD in CHRIST, and that <HI>there is forgivene&s;s with him that he may be feared, and plenteous redemption.</HI> And the apprehen&s;ion of this, in&s;tead of embold|ning the Sinner in his &s;inful cour&s;es, helps to fill the penitent with grief and &s;hame, and &s;or|row for his Sins, with an utter hatred and ab|horrence of all Sins, with an holy indignation again&s;t him&s;elf for having &s;o often committed that abominable thing, which is &s;o hateful and offen&s;ive to GOD: and which has &s;o defiled and degraded him&s;elf, and made him more vile than the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. Yet this is not all that is contained in a true Repentance: it carries a Sinner further than <HI>this</HI>; even to full purpo|&s;es and re&s;olutions, by divine Grace, again&s;t all Sin what&s;oever. This is the language of a true Penitent, <HI>Wherein I have done Iniquity, I will do

no more.</HI> And then finally, <HI>It</HI> intends our dili|gent, and earne&s;t endeavours again&s;t Sin, even again&s;t tho&s;e Sins that do the more ea&s;ily be&s;et us, and that have the mo&s;t frequently overcome us. And then altho' this may not come into the Idea of Repentance according to the &s;trict Notion of it; yet it is the natural, nece&s;&s;ary &amp; con&s;tant effect of it; namely, an actual for&s;ak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of our Sins, a Reformation of our Lives, and a turning our feet into the paths of GOD's Commandments.</P>
<P>And now that &s;uch a Repentance as this is re|quired, and in&s;i&s;ted upon in order to our bring pardoned, and accepted as righteous in the &s;ight of GOD, is very evident from the whole current of Scripture; wherein pardon, and forgivene&s;s of our Sins, is never propo&s;ed to us, but upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that we are truly humble, and peni|tent for them. This we find to be the tenor of the old Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation. <HI>Who&s;o cove|reth his &s;ins &s;hall not pro&s;per, but he that confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh them &s;hall find mercy,</HI> Prov. 28.13 <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way &amp; the Unrighteous men his thoughts, &amp; let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</HI> I&s;ai 55.7. By which we &s;ee that altho' GOD is ready to pardon, and pro|claims his Name the Lord, the Lord GOD, mer|ciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity and tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in: yet the Sinner in order to be forgiven, mu&s;t confe&s;s and for&s;ake his &s;ins, mu&s;t be truly humble &amp; penitent for them. And then further, as this was in&s;i&s;ted upon under the legal, &s;o is it as much under the evangelical di&s;pen&s;a|tion;
<PB N="185" REF="002987_0190_0FE6B12E1A2F79D8">
for there it appears as plainly that without Repentance there is no Remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Re|pentance was the Doctrine which <HI>John</HI> the fore-runner of CHRIST, and who was to prepare the way for him, taught by his Preaching, and by his manner of Living: which may be con&s;idered as an allegory, and &s;erves to teach us, that Repen|tance is the fore-runner of Remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in; and that it prepares the way for CHRIST to be&s;tow a pardon upon us. But then this was the Doctrine that CHRIST him&s;elf began his publick Preaching with. <HI>Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</HI> Mat. 4.17. And he &s;ays. <HI>It behoved him</HI>; or it was nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>That Repentance &amp; Remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his Name,</HI> Luk. 24.47. Ob&s;erve the order, <HI>Repentance &amp; Reme&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Fir&s;t <HI>Repen|tance,</HI> and then Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins; Repentance in order to Remi&s;&s;ion. And this we find to be the A|po&s;tles method, for when <HI>Peter</HI>'s Sermon had prick|ed many to the heart, &amp; they cryed out, <HI>Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do</HI>? he tells them <HI>to Re|pent, and be Baptized in the Name of Je&s;us Christ, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> Act. 2.38. Plainly teaching that Repentance was nece&s;&s;ary to for|givene&s;s. So in chap. 3. v. 19. <HI>Repent ye there|fore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out.</HI> By all which it appears that GOD requires and in&s;i&s;ts upon Repentance in order to our &s;ins being blotted out And now the Wi&s;dom and the Prudence of GOD di&s;covers it &s;elf herein.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Altho' GOD forgives the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of his Law, yet he maintains the honour of his Law by this means.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="002987_0191_0FE6B12E2E048868">If GOD &s;hould pardon a Sinner that remains Impenitent, it would be a di&s;honour to Him&s;elf, and a di&s;paragement to his Law: for what could be thought in &s;uch a ca&s;e but that GOD had given too rigid, and &s;evere a law to us, and had impo&s;ed an unrea&s;onable Service on us in the Injunctions of his Word, and con&s;equently that the law was not &s;o holy, nor the Commandment &s;o holy, ju&s;t and good as it is declared to be, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. which GOD being &s;en&s;ible of, forgave them, and over|looked their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his law, without any penitent acknowledgement of a fault in them, and as if he him&s;elf was rather in an error than they.</P>
<P>But now by GOD's in&s;i&s;ting upon deep humili|ation and thorow Repentance for all our Sins, in order to their being pardoned and forgiven; there is a demon&s;trative te&s;timony given to the holi|ne&s;s, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of his Commandments: for every true Penitent acknowledges all this. When a Man unfeignedly repents of his Sins, he implicitly, if not expre&s;sly, acknowledges the ho|line&s;s, and the goodne&s;s of the&s;e Commands, that he has lived in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of. For unle&s;s a Man has a &s;uitable &s;en&s;e of this he can't have a &s;en&s;e of the evil of Sin, and &s;o can't be thorowly humbled for his own Sin. And now as every true Penitent does acknowledge the goodne&s;s of the divine Law, and his own indi&s;pen&s;able Obligati|ons to it; &s;o hereby the honour of the law is maintained, even altho' the Sinner be forgiven, infinitely beyond what it would be, if an Im|penitent Sinner &s;hould obtain a pardon. Now there can't be the lea&s;t reflection upon the divine

Law in GOD's pardoning the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of it, for be&s;ides the full &s;atisfaction that is made for Sin; the Sinner him&s;elf magnifies the law of GOD, and makes it honourable, by honouring it in his heart, and retracting every thing that he has &s;aid or done, that &s;howed any contempt of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In this Method the glory of divine Holine&s;s will not be at all Eclip&s;ed, altho' he receives the Sinner into favour.</HI></P>
<P>If GOD &s;hould receive impenitent Sinners into favour; if he &s;hould embrace them in his bo&s;om, and make them the &s;pecial objects of delight, and complacence, what would all the World of rational Beings have &s;aid upon it, but that GOD was become altogether &s;uch an one as our &s;elves? Surely it would have rai&s;ed a univer&s;al doubting in the brea&s;ts of Angels &amp; Men, whether he was <HI>&s;o glorious in Holine&s;s,</HI> and whether he <HI>was of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</HI> But now, by refu&s;ing to pardon a Sinner, or to receive him in|to favour, before he be truly humbled for his &s;in, or before his heart is broken for his &s;in, and bro|ken off from all &s;in, he &s;hows that he bears the &s;ame hatred to &s;in as ever, and is not in the lea&s;t reconciled to it. Surely every one will look upon GOD as glorious in holine&s;s, that ob&s;erves the hatred and di&s;plea&s;ure he di&s;covers again&s;t all ob&s;tinate and impenitent Sinners, and his re&s;olu|tion to abandon them for ever; and how he &s;hews favour to none but &s;uch as have by a deep and thorow Repentance returned unto him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In this Method Men are better prepared and di&s;po&s;ed to give GOD the glory of his Mercy, Pinardoning and Saving them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="002987_0193_0FE6B12F71C04460">If impenitent Sinners (while they continue &s;uch) were pardoned, in&s;tead of being thankful to GOD for manife&s;ting &s;uch infinite Grace to them: they would only take the opportunity to abu&s;e his Goodne&s;s, and turn his Grace into wan|tene&s;s, by going on pre&s;umptuou&s;ly in their &s;ins, and rebellions again&s;t him. But now a Man that is fir&s;t brought to Repentance, and then to a Par|don, he will be filled with adoring thankfulne&s;s to GOD for &s;uch an infinite Mercy: for the hum|ble Soul will be &s;en&s;ible what a dreadful condition he was in without a Pardon, and how utterly un|worthy he was of one, and what an act of free, &s;overeign Grace it is in GOD to forgive him, and &s;ave him from the wrath that is to come, and to receive him into favour. I &s;ay, the true Peni|tent will have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things as will inlarge his Soul in the utmo&s;t thankfulne&s;s to GOD, when he &s;hall thus have Mercy on him.

<P N="4">4. <HI>By this means there is not that danger of a Pardoned Sinners returning to his Sinful Cour&s;es, and &s;o walking unworthy of his Pardoned Staff.</HI></P>

But now GOD, by taking care that Men &s;hould be brought to Repentance before they are pardoned, and relea&s;ed from puni&s;hment, has effectually prevented this. For a Sinner being brought to &s;uch a fight &amp; &s;en&s;e of Sin as really to hate and abhor it; there will not be that danger of his returning again to it; altho' his pa&s;t offences &s;hould be pardoned and pa&s;&s;ed by. Indeed every Man even the very be&s;t would relap&s;e, and return to their &s;inful cour&s;es; if GOD did not re&s;train and uphold them by his Grace.

Nay the thoughts that he has received &s;uch an infinite Mercy from GOD as the pardon of his Sins, will make him more careful, &amp; more fearful than ever of abu&s;ing the riches of divine Grace that have been magnifyed towards him, by returning a|gain unto &s;in and folly.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Another thing that GOD requires in order to our being Justifyed, is Faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and herein al&s;o there appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>That Faith is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to our Ju&s;tification and Salvation, is plainly taught us in that Go&s;pel, wherein alone the Doctrine of a Sinners Ju&s;tification, and the Man|ner of it is revealed unto us; therein our Sa|viour tells us. That <HI>who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life: and that he that believeth on the &s;on hath everla&s;ting life; and he that believeth not the &s;on &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> Joh. 3.16, 36.

Accordingly, we are expre&s;sly &s;aid to be ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ied by Faith: Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being justi|fyed by faith, we have peace with God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> And we are &s;aid to be &s;aved by Grace <HI>thro' Faith,</HI> Eph. 2.8. And then the Righteou&s;ne&s;s, even the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is imputed to us for our Ju&s;tification, is &s;aid to be by Faith, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 9.

of God by faith</HI>: (<HI>i e.</HI>) the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t received by faith in him. Now the faith &s;poken of in the&s;e places, and which GOD re|quires of us in order to our Ju&s;tification is in general this; Namely, <HI>A receiving of Chri&s;t as our only Saviour, and a depending entirely upon him for Salvation in the way of the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>And this contains and implies many things in it: for, as many things are requi&s;ite to the ren|dring Chri&s;t a compleat, and an al&s;ufficient Sa|viour; &s;o he that receives him as his Saviour, and re&s;ts upon him alone for Salvation, mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to believe all tho&s;e qualifications to be in him, and to accept of him in every Office which is nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;u&s;tain and execute, in order to his accompli&s;hing Salvation for us.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As it was nece&s;&s;ary that Chri&s;t in order to his being a Compleat Saviour, &s;hould &s;u&s;tain &amp; execute the Prophetical Office: &s;o Faith in Chri&s;t intends our receiving him as the great Prophet &s;ent from GOD unto us.</HI></P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary that he who undertook our Salvation &s;hould be fully acquainted with the Mind &amp; Will of GOD, and the way to life and happine&s;s.

<PB N="192" REF="002987_0197_0FE6B13920D21D68">
the Office of a Prophet. For this was foretold of him that he &s;hould be a Prophet: Deut. 18.15. <HI>The Lord thy God will rai&s;e up unto thee a Prophet, from the mid&s;t of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me, unto him &s;hall ye hearken.</HI> Now this Prophet was CHRIST, as appears by the Apo&s;tles (who were under the direction of the infallible Spirit) applying the Prophecy of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to him, <HI>Act.</HI> 3.22. Accordingly he executes this Office. He did &s;o in his publick Mini&s;try, and in the whole reve|lation that he made of GOD, of Him&s;elf, and of the way to life by him, and in tho&s;e gifts of the holy Gho&s;t wherewith he endowed the Apo&s;tles, to accompli&s;h them for teaching all Nations, as he had commanded them. Moreover, this Office is now Executed in the &s;tanding revelation which he affords us in the Go&s;pel, in the gifts of teaching which he affords unto his Mini&s;ters; and more e&s;pecially in the &s;ecret, but mo&s;t effectual teach|ings and illuminations, which he affords to the Souls of Men, in their Regeneration and Conver|&s;ion, whereby they come to under&s;tand, and di&s;|cern &s;piritual things in a &s;piritual manner. Now then that faith in Chri&s;t which is nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Ju&s;tification, intends our receiving him as &s;uch a Prophet: It intends, that we believe as we are told. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.18. That Chri&s;t <HI>was in the bo&s;ome of the Father</HI>; was fully acquainted with him, and his Mind and Will, and made the fulle&s;t, and the true&s;t declaration of him. It intends, that we look upon all that he has taught as true &amp; faith|ful &s;ayings, as the infallible Oracles of GOD. We mu&s;t believe all the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel,

even the mo&s;t &s;ublime and my&s;terious of them, becau&s;e Chri&s;t who is full of Truth, as well as Grace, has revealed them unto us. We mu&s;t be|lieve the Precepts, that the Rules of living which he has taught us, are exactly agreable to the will of GOD, and the direct way to plea&s;e him, and to be happy in him. Moreover, we mu&s;t believe the Promi&s;es, and the Threatnings and that they will be intirely accompli&s;hed and executed, as the Scriptures declare. But then, if we would re|ceive Chri&s;t in his Prophetical Office, we mu&s;t depend upon him, for tho&s;e inward teachings, and tho&s;e &s;piritual Illuminations that we &s;tand in need of. We mu&s;t depend upon him not only to give us an External Knowledge of divine Truths, but for a Spiritual di&s;cerning of them: Now faith in Chri&s;t intends that we thus receive him as a Prophet.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As it was nece&s;&s;ary that Christ &s;hould Under|take and Manage the Priestly Office in order to his being a Compleat Saviour to us; &s;o that Faith in Chri&s;t by which we are Ju&s;tifyed, is a receiving Him as our great High-Priest.</HI></P>
<P>In order to Chri&s;t's becoming a Saviour to us; it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould offer up a Sacri|fice to GOD, to make Atonement for our Sins; and then to plead the Merits of that Sacrifice on our behalf, that &s;o we might be intitled to the benefits and ble&s;&s;ings purcha&s;ed thereby, and this is properly the Prie&s;tly Office. And this we find the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to have been in the faithful Execution of; for he has offered a Sacri|fice to GOD, which mu&s;t needs be &s;ufficient to

When he con|&s;iders of his Sin, and the Cur&s;es of the Law that are denounced again&s;t the Sinner: he fetches all his comfort from this, that he has an <HI>Advocate with the Fathers, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous, who is a Propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only; but for the &s;ins of the whole world,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.1.</P>

It is a depending upon him for Grace, and &s;piritual Strength, as be|ing &s;en&s;ible that without him we can do nothing: and on the other hand, that we can do all things thro' Chri&s;t &s;trengthning us.

And it is in &s;hort, a looking up|on Chri&s;t as every way fitted &amp; qualified for a Saviour, and as the only one that is &s;o: and a committing the whole affair of our Salvation to him; renouncing all tru&s;t, or dependence on our &s;elves, or any but Chri&s;t; believing that he, and he only is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t.

<P>Nothing is more unrea&s;onable in its &s;elf, no|thing does &s;o di&s;honour GOD, or deny him the glory due unto his Name, as a &s;elf glorying and a &s;elf boa&s;ting &s;pirit: and there is nothing that would maintain and keep &s;uch a temper within us &s;o much, as for us to be ju&s;tifyed and re&s;to|red to the divine Favour, while we remained in Unbelief.

Faith helps a Man to &s;ee him&s;elf to be nothing, it gives him to &s;ee that he has not, and could not do any thing towards his reconciliation with GOD, or re&s;toration to the divine Favour. Yea, it gives him to &s;ee that the very faith by which he is ju&s;tifyed, is not of him&s;elf, but is the gift of GOD, and &s;o it takes away all foundation for boa&s;ting; becau&s;e it tells us that all we have, we've received; and &s;o enables us to argue with Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 4.7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ from another, and what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why doe&s;t thou glory, as if thou had&s;t not received it?</HI> Thus does faith &s;erve to keep the heart of Man hum|ble, even at the receiving the greate&s;t favours and ble&s;&s;ings, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our minds that they are freely given to us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This faith required in order to our Ju&s;tifica|tion, prepares and di&s;po&s;es us to give the glory thereof to Chri&s;t which is the glory due to his Name.</HI></P>
<P>For by our depending upon Chri&s;t for Sal|vation, we acknowledge that all our Salvation mu&s;t come from him; and &s;o when we receive it we &s;hall give the glory of all to him. Faith
<PB N="199" REF="002987_0204_0FE6B156A5DB5478">
tells, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind of the pardoned, re|newed and &s;anctifyed Man, that it is all freely given him of GOD, and that it is all the fruit of free, rich and &s;overeign Grace. This is the language of Faith, <HI>By the grace of God I am what I am. By grace ye are &s;aved thro' faith, and that not of your &s;elves, it is the gift of God. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but ac|cording to his mercy he &s;aved us. And &s;o not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the glory.</HI></P>
<P>And now this is Wi&s;dom in GOD, becau&s;e as he de&s;igns his own glory in the Ju&s;tification and Salvation of a Sinner; &s;o what more effectual way to di&s;po&s;e them to it than by en|dowing their hearts with faith, whereby they &s;ee, and &s;o mu&s;t needs acknowledge to his glory, all Mercy and Grace coming from him, without the lea&s;t merit, or worthine&s;s of their own.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This Faith fits and di&s;po&s;es a Man to walk worthy of &s;uch an Infinite Mercy, as that of a pardon.</HI></P>

He will have his heart influ|enced with love to GOD, and filled with the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ires, and diligent endeavors to be living to GOD, and to the prai&s;e &amp; glory of his Name.

&s;en&s;e of the Infinite Mercies of GOD, to pre&s;ent him&s;elf a living Sacrifice to him. This will In|fluence him, from the con&s;ideration that he is not his own, being bought with a price, to glorify GOD in his Body, and in his Spirit, which are his; by which he will not only &s;peak, but live GOD's Prai&s;es, and in a practical manner give him the glory of his Mercy: which he would not, if there was not a principle of faith Implanted in the Soul in order to his Ju&s;tification: which &s;erves to &s;hew the Wi&s;dom of GOD in requiring this of us.

<P>All the <HI>Improvement</HI> I &s;hall make of what has been &s;aid upon this head, &s;hall be only in a word, to Exhort all <HI>to the exerci&s;e of Repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>GOD who has the &s;ole power of di&s;pen&s;ing par|dons, will never be&s;tow one, but upon the peni|tent, and believing Sinner. Without Repentance there is no remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and he that believes not &s;hall be damned. Therefore, as ever we would be in a pardoned State, (and Oh how hap|py is the Man that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e!) We mu&s;t &s;trive after a penitent, and believing heart. Let us by &s;erious thought &amp; meditation be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our &s;elves with &s;uitable apprehen&s;ions of the In|finite Evil there is in Sin; that we might mourn over out own Sins, and repent of them. But e&s;pecially let us pray to GOD that he would &s;end his Spirit to convince us of our Sins, and to &s;et them &s;o in order before us as that we might abhor

our &s;elves, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes. And &s;ince Faith is not of our &s;elves, but the gift of GOD, let us apply our &s;elves to him in all the ways that he has directed, for the precious faith of his Elect, whereby we may receive the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t as he is offered to us in the Go&s;pel, and re&s;t upon him alone for Salvation. And when we have attained to this, we &s;hall be prepared for the pardoning Mercy of GOD.

<P>But now among &s;erious &amp; thoughtful Per&s;ons, that are greatly concerned about their future &s;tate: Such a Que&s;tion as this will naturally ari&s;e within them: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Q. <HI>How &s;hall we know when we are in &s;uch a penitent, believing State, as will intitle us to the pardoning Mercy of GOD?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Now the be&s;t, and the only certain way of knowing this, is, by the fruits and effects of &s;uch a principle of faith, and penitence in the Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The tree is known by its fruit.</HI> If there be &s;uch a Repentance as is real, and &s;uch a Faith as is of the operation of GOD, they will have &s;uch effects upon us, as will di&s;cover them&s;elves to be true and genuine. Here I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If the Repentance be &s;incere, and &s;uch as fits for the pardoning Mercy of GOD; it will produce a univer&s;al Reformation of our Lives.</HI></P>
<P>He that is heartily &s;orry for, and really hates his &s;ins, will mo&s;t certainly for&s;ake them. And
<PB N="202" REF="002987_0207_0FE6B1584640A1B8">
therefore he that lives in the willful allowance of any known &s;ins, has never truly repented of them. And let not that Man think that he has received the pardoning Mercy of GOD: for verily he is &s;till in the Gall of bitterne&s;s, and bonds of iniquity.</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That faith which will Ju&s;tify us before GOD, will always have the&s;e effects</HI>: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It will always purifie the Heart.</HI> Act. 15.9.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tifying Faith refines and &s;piritualizes the Mind, and delivers it from tho&s;e dark and gro&s;s Ideas, that a carnal mind labours under. There will be more ju&s;t and true Notions of GOD, and Chri&s;t, and &s;piritual things, there will be a &s;pi|ritual di&s;cerning of them beyond what is ever experienced by an Unbeliever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It always works by love.</HI> Gal. 5.6.</P>
<P>It gives us &s;uch realizing apprehen&s;ions of the Infinite love of GOD in Chri&s;t, as will influence our hearts in love unto him who has expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch infinite love to us. It will fill us with holy de|&s;ires after him, and the greate&s;t delight in him, and in all tho&s;e ways wherein we may have Communion with him. Moreover it will excite a &s;incere &amp; fervent Charity towards our fellow-Creatures, enabling us to love our Neighbour as our &s;elves, and to expre&s;s it in all acts of Ju&s;tice, and Charity that we are capable of, and have op|portunity for.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It helps us to overcome the World.</HI> 1 Joh. 5.4.</P>
<P>It gives us &s;uch realizing views and pro&s;pects of the Eternal and Invi&s;ible World; as enables us to ca&s;t an holy contempt upon this pre&s;ent

<P>Now the&s;e are &s;ome of the con&s;tant effects of a true Repentance, and a &s;aving Faith&punc; And therefore when ever we find a principle in us working after &s;uch a manner, we may conclude there is wrought within us a Repentance unto Salvation never to be repented of, and the Faith of GOD's Elect, the end of which will be the Sal|vation of our Souls.</P>

<P>THE In&s;tance of Divine Wi&s;dom under con|&s;ideration, is, <HI>the Application of the Re|demption purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, and the manner of it.</HI></P>
<P>And under this head,</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed a di&s;tinct handling the &s;everal parts of our Redemption; &s;uch as our Ju&s;tification, Re|generation, and the progre&s;s of it in Sanctification, and our future Glorification: and at the &s;ame time to con&s;ider the manner of the Application of the&s;e things unto us, and the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appear therein.

Ju&s;tification; and how GOD has in that affair abounded towards us in Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</P>
<P>I now proceed to con&s;ider another part of that Redemption that Chri&s;t has wrought out for us, and the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears in the Ap|plication of it. So then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In the Regeneration, or Conver&s;ion of a Sin|ner, and the progre&s;s of it in Sanctification, there appears Infinite Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>The Regeneration, or Conver&s;ion of a Sinner is his having a thorow Change wrought in his heart. It is his being brought out of a State of Nature, into a State of Grace. It con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ubduing our Lu&s;ts and Corruptions; and in Implanting gracious and holy principles in the Soul: in re|moving the habits of &s;in, and the natural aver&s;i|ons from that which is good, and in inclining our hearts to GOD, and to every thing that is holy, ju&s;t and good. In &s;hort, it is <HI>the Creating a clean heart, and renewing a right &s;pirit within us. It is a quickning us who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins</HI>: breathing a Spiritual Life into the Soul. It is an <HI>Opening mens eyes, turning them from dark|ne&s;s to light, and from the power of &s;atan unto God.</HI></P>
<P>As for Sanctification, it is the progre&s;s of this gracious Change wrought in us at our Conver&s;ion; it is our growth in Grace, a going from one degree of it to another, and our abounding more &amp; more in the fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And now that there is a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence di&s;|playing it &s;elf in this affair, will abundantly ap|pear, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The work it &s;elf, even that of Converting Sin|ners, working divine Grace in the Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="205" REF="002987_0210_0FE6B167DD536688">2. <HI>The Manner &amp; Method GOD takes in the Work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The outward Means made u&s;e of in this Work.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If we con&s;ider the Work of Regeneration or Conver&s;ion it &s;elf, we &s;hall &s;ee a great deal of the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</HI></P>
<P>For (as I have already ob&s;erved) the highe&s;t, and la&s;t End GOD can propo&s;e, is his own glory; and con&s;equently the pur&s;uing tho&s;e things that will effectually promote this, is to act wi&s;ely, and with the Prudence that becomes him; and there|fore if the work of Conver&s;ion be &s;uch a work as tends to the glory of GOD, it mu&s;t be look'd up|on as an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom in GOD to perform it, and &s;urely if any of the works of GOD &s;erve to declare his glory, this, of the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners will: for it &s;erves to the glory of GOD on two accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it prepares, di&s;po&s;es, and enables a num|ber of his Creatures in an active manner to give glory to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it &s;erves to di&s;play and magnifie &s;everal of the divine Perfections.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Conver&s;ion of Sinners is for the glory of GOD, as it prepares, di&s;po&s;es and enables a num|ber of his Creatures in an active way and manner to give glory to him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is with every one that is Converted, and brought into a &s;tate of Grace. Before their Conver&s;ion they (in the greatne&s;s of their folly) go a &s;tray from GOD; and by their &s;in and di&s;|obedience do greatly di&s;honour him, and offer in|finite affronts to him; but when once there is a
<PB N="206" REF="002987_0211_0FE6B167F22B1420">
gracious Change wrought in their hearts (as there is in Regeneration) they are at once di&s;po&s;ed, and enabled to give unto the LORD the glory due unto his Name. When once the heart of a Sin|ner is changed, he &s;ees &s;o much of the greatne&s;s, and the glory of GOD, e&s;pecially in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that fills him with the highe&s;t love, e&s;teem and admiration of him. The Soul Con|verted is inlarged in thankfulne&s;s to GOD, and is for &s;hewing forth the prai&s;es of him who has called him out of darkne&s;s into this marvellous light. He is for glorifying GOD in his body, and in his &s;pirit which are his: he is di&s;po&s;ed to ble&s;s the LORD whil&s;t he lives, and to give thanks unto him whil&s;t he has any Being. True Grace in the heart di&s;po&s;es a Man not only to prai&s;e GOD on Earth; but qualifies to joyn the heavenly Ho&s;t in &s;inging Prai&s;es and Hallelujahs to GOD, and the Lamb for ever in Heaven. As we have them repre&s;ented in the vi&s;ions of <HI>John, Rev.</HI> 5.9. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The work of Conver&s;ion &s;erves to illustrate &s;everal of the divine Perfections.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is a work that &s;erves very much to &s;et forth the Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>The glory of divine Power appears in propor|tion to the difficulty of the work that he accom|pli&s;hes. The further any work is beyond our Power, or beyond the reach of any Creature, the more gloriou&s;ly does the mighty Power of GOD &s;hine forth in the accompli&s;hment of it. And now what work is greater, or more beyond the Power of any Creature among all the great, and
<PB N="207" REF="002987_0212_0FE6B174A2AE8E28">
marvellous works of GOD, than this of Conver|ting, and Changing the hearts of Sinners? The Creating us at fir&s;t was a great and wonderful work of GOD, and &s;erved very much to di&s;play his <HI>Eternal Power and God-head</HI>: But the Con|verting us, and Creating us a-New in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto holine&s;s, &amp; good works, &s;eems to be as great (if not a greater) Manife&s;tation of divine Power. For in the fir&s;t Creation there was nothing to op|po&s;e, or re&s;i&s;t GOD in it; but in our Conver&s;ion, or the New Creation, there is a great deal of Op|po&s;ition, or Re&s;i&s;tance from the World, the Devil, and our own Corrupt hearts.</P>
<P>The Devil ever &s;ince he &s;educed our fir&s;t Pa|rents, has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Souls for him&s;elf. He is that <HI>Spirit that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience,</HI> Eph. 2.2. He does all he can to oppo&s;e and hinder the work of Grace upon our Souls; he exerts all his power, and the utmo&s;t skill and policy, to keep us in &s;lavery &amp; &s;ubjection to him, and our own lu&s;t; he endeavours to rai&s;e within us all po&s;&s;ible prejudices again&s;t GOD, and all that is good: and there are Legions of the&s;e cur&s;ed Fiends that combine together to op|po&s;e our Conver&s;ion, that unite their Power and Subtility to keep us in Slavery to our lu&s;ts, and to hinder the Strivings of GOD's Spirit accompa|nying the outward Means of Grace from taking effect upon us. Therefore GOD in Converting a Sinner, makes his great Power known: for in that work he triumphs, yea, and enables the Sin|ner who was in Slavery and Subjection to them now, to triumph <HI>over Principalities and Powers,
<PB N="208" REF="002987_0213_0FE6B174B70AA708">
and the Rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world.</HI> In Conver&s;ion GOD &s;hows Him&s;elf to be Stronger than the Devil, <HI>That &s;trong man armed,</HI> becau&s;e he overcomes him, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls of him, <HI>takes from him all his armour wherein he tru&s;ted, and divideth his &s;poils.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, There is a glorious Manife&s;ta|tion of divine Power in inlightning the dark Minds, and in removing the natural Oppo&s;ition that prevails in the hearts of Men &s;ince the fall again&s;t GOD and holine&s;s. Was it an illu&s;tra|tion of divine Power, to open the eyes of the blind, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were born blind? How much greater Power mu&s;t needs he exerci&s;ed in inlightning a dark Soul? In opening the eyes of our Under&s;tandings; <HI>which were darkned&punc; being alienated from the life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of our hearts?</HI> What Power is there put forth in breaking &amp; di&s;&s;olving our hard &amp; &s;tony hearts? in &s;ubduing our &s;tubborn &amp; rebellious wills? Verily when GOD does thus of unwilling make us willing, it mu&s;t needs be in the day of his mighty Power: for it is beyond the Power of any meer Creature to accompli&s;h. And there|fore when ever &s;uch a Change is wrought, GOD makes his great Power known, and &s;hows what the P&s;almi&s;t <HI>heard once, yea twice, that Power belongeth unto him,</HI> P&s;al. 62.11.</P>
<P>And here, I cannot but ob&s;erve how proper and &s;uitable, and &s;o how very Wi&s;e &amp; Prudent it is in GOD to manife&s;t his Power in this mat|ter in particular: for if GOD had never put
<PB N="209" REF="002987_0214_0FE6B176136FEFD8">
forth a power &s;ufficient for the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners, there would have been danger of &s;ome re|flections being ca&s;t upon him, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was not able to reduce his rebellious Creatures that had revolted from him, to their duty &amp; allegiance. GOD never did Convert any of the fallen Angels, but &s;uffers them to go on in their rebellions a|gain&s;t him. And if he had never Converted any of the Children of Men, but had only puni&s;hed them for their Sin, he would not have &s;hown that power and dominion over the hearts of Men, which now he has: for how would it have appeared that GOD has the hearts of all in his own hands, and can turn them as the rivers of Water are turned, unle&s;s he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a change upon &s;ome of them, as there is wrought, in their Conver&s;ion, even an entire change of the temper &amp; di&s;po&s;ition of the heart? If all the World had remained in their Sin, would it not have been &s;aid, that when once we had revolted from GOD, and gone over to the Devils &s;ide, GOD could not reduce us, and bring us back into his Service? Whereas now by making &s;ome of the&s;e rebellious ones even &s;ome of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of them, a willing and obedient People in the day of his power, he Convinces all the World, that he could have reduced all his rebellious Creatures (even the Devils them&s;elves) to their Loyalty and Sub|jection if he plea&s;ed; for in the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners he exerts a power over them, as well as over the hearts of Men, and therefore altho' GOD &s;uf|fers the Devils with the greate&s;t part of Mankind to go on in their rebellions again&s;t him, it appears

<P>As it is an act of power, &s;o it is an act of &s;o|vereign Grace, to Convert a Sinner. It is an In|finite Mercy to the Sinner to have &s;uch a change wrought in him, &amp; &s;o infinite Goodne&s;s &amp; Kindne&s;s in GOD to do it. We brought our &s;elves into this wretched &s;tate of ignorance, blindne&s;s &amp; darkne&s;s, we ca&s;t our &s;elves out of the kingdom &amp; &s;ervice of GOD, and made our &s;elves &s;laves and va&s;&s;als to the Devil, and to our own Lu&s;ts.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Order, Method and Manner of GOD's proceeding in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, is a fur|ther di&s;covery of the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the work.</HI></P>
<P>Under this head I &s;hall con&s;ider, (1) The Or|der GOD ob&s;erves in working this Change. (2) The Secret, My&s;terious and Un&s;earchable way of the Spirit's working this Regenerating Change in the Soul. (3) The variety of Per&s;ons on whom GOD be&s;tows converting Grace.

<P N="1">1. <HI>If we con&s;ider the Order and Method GOD ob&s;erves in working this Change in the heart, we &s;hall &s;ee the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, GOD when he works a gracious Change in the Soul, begins with the higher and nobler Faculties, and &s;o proceeds to the inferiour powers of it. To go upon the common di&s;tinction of the faculties of the Soul, into the Under&s;tand|ing, Will and Affections; it has been di&s;|puted by Divines, Whether this Regenerating work begins upon the Will, or the Under&s;tanding? but the difference between them is not very great in the conclu&s;ion; for all will allow this in the acts of a Regenerate Soul, after the charge wrought, the Under&s;tanding is the leading and governing faculty, and the Will follows the dictates of it. And &s;o without entring into the di&s;pute (which I have not time for at pre&s;ent) I will &s;uppo&s;e that GOD begins the work in the Under&s;tanding inlightning that in the fir&s;t place; removing the
<PB N="212" REF="002987_0217_0FE6B17F32A8D770">
darkne&s;s &amp; blindne&s;s which our Souls thro' Sin and Lu&s;t are covered with. Since the Fall the Under&s;tanding is darkned, <HI>being alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in them:</HI> and hence the natural Man, <HI>i. e.</HI> a Man in the State of Nature, <HI>knows not the things of the Spirit of God; but they are fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him, neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;|cerned.</HI> The natural Man &s;ees nothing in GOD, or Chri&s;t, or in Religion that is excellent and de&s;ireable; by which means he de&s;pi&s;es, and neglects them, and follows after lying Vanities. Now GOD in the Work of Conver&s;ion begins with enlightning the Under&s;tanding, and offer|ing Conviction to it. The fir&s;t &s;tep GOD takes &s;eems to be to open Mens eyes, and give them to &s;ee the evil of Sin, and the wondrous things out of GOD's Law. To &s;ee our need of Chri&s;t, his ful|ne&s;s, and &s;ufficiency for us, and his infinite readi|ne&s;s to receive us upon our coming unto him. I &s;ay, this is the fir&s;t &s;tep GOD takes in conver|ting a Sinner, to give him a clear, and convincing Sight of the&s;e things, a lively Apprehen&s;ion and full Per&s;wa&s;ion of them in his own Mind, beyond what he ever had before, and beyond what any Man in his natural E&s;tate attains unto: and now the Under&s;tanding being enlightned, the Will al|&s;o is renewed; and &s;o is per&s;waded and inclined to follow the Dictates of the inlightned Under|&s;tanding. But now when I &s;peak of this as ano|ther &s;tep that GOD takes in our Conver&s;ion, I dont &s;uppo&s;e any di&s;tance of time in this work of GOD upon the Soul from the other, but that the
<PB N="213" REF="002987_0218_0FE6B18317401278">
Will and the Under&s;tanding are both wrought upon together, the one is before the other in order of Nature only, not in time. For it is by the clear light, and &s;trong Conviction brought to the Un|der&s;tanding, that the Will is moved &amp; per&s;waded to comply with its Dictates.</P>
<P>And now GOD's proceeding with us in &s;uch a way, is Wi&s;dom in GOD: And that for this ea&s;y rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Becau&s;e this is a dealing with us agreably to our Natures, as Rational Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>It is very Wi&s;e and Prudent for GOD, in all his workings with, and upon his Creatures, to con|&s;ider the particular Natures he has given to them, and to deal with them accordingly. And thus he deals with us in the work of our Conver&s;ion; for having given rational and intellective powers to us, powers of Under&s;tanding, &amp; Apprehending, and then of Willing &amp; Choo&s;ing according to the dictates of the Under&s;tanding; he accordingly when he Converts a Man, begins with the Under|&s;tanding, <HI>that</HI> being the leading and governing faculty, and makes u&s;e of <HI>this</HI> to incline &amp; per|&s;wade the Will; and &s;o the Man makes a rational Choice, and is per&s;waded from rational con&s;idera|tions. If GOD &s;hould &s;o work upon the Will in the fir&s;t place, as to incline and di&s;po&s;e a Man, to hate Sin, to make choice of GOD, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ways of Religion, before he had rectifyed and inlight|ned the Under&s;tanding, and &s;o given him to &s;ee the evil of Sin, and the excellency of Religion, he would not have dealt with us according to the ra|tional Nature that he has given us; and &s;o our
<PB N="214" REF="002987_0219_0FE6B1832BB70A40">
Conver&s;ion to GOD would not have been a proper rational act. The proper rule and method for a rational Being is to follow the dictates of his rea|&s;on; and to chu&s;e and refu&s;e as his rea&s;on &s;hall inform and direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im. And therefore GOD i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his great Wi&s;dom takes care not to break in upon this order of Nature, even in that great and &s;uper|natural work of our Conver&s;ion. He will have us Convinced of the evil of Sin in order to our repenting of and for&s;aking it. He will have us &s;ee the beauty of Holine&s;s, the excellency of Religion, in order to our making choice of it, and complying with its Precepts. He will have us &s;ee the fulne&s;s and &s;ufficiency there is in Chri&s;t, and the need we &s;tand in of him in order to our receiving him. And now in this method, our Conver&s;ion, in&s;tead of breaking in upon, or offer|ing any force to our faculties, is an improving, a rectifying and &s;trengthning them. For our Con|ver&s;ion or turning to GOD is only the regular act and exerci&s;e of our rational Powers put into &s;uch a motion by the &s;upernatural Grace of GOD; and &s;o every regenerate act in us is only acting according to our rea&s;on under the highe&s;t and be&s;t Improvement, and not the lea&s;t inver&s;ion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Nature, nor any force, or violence offer|ed to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If we con&s;ider the &s;ecret, my&s;terious, and un|perceptible was of the Spirit's working this Regene|rating Change within the Soul, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;omething of the Wi&s;dom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>That our Regeneration, or Conver&s;ion is wrought by the Spirit of GOD is &s;ufficiently taught us in
<PB N="215" REF="002987_0220_0FE6B191940945C0">
the Scriptures, which declare this to be the &s;peci|al work of the Spirit of GOD; for therein we find not only the &s;everal parts of Conver&s;ion di&s;|tinctly a&s;cribed to the Spirit; but the whole work in general. Thus our Saviour &s;peaks of our being Regenerated or <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> as nece&s;&s;ary in order to our entring into the kingdom of GOD, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.5. And it is called, <HI>the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Tit. 3.5. But now the Spirit of GOD works this Saving Change in a mo&s;t &s;ecret, my&s;terious and unperceptible manner; as our Saviour tells us, Joh. 3.8. <HI>The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou bearest the &s;ound thereof, but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth: &s;o is every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> The way of the Spirit is un&s;earchable, we cannot find out the manner of it's operations upon us in the work of Conver&s;ion. Indeed the effects of it are plain, and very di&s;cernible, but not the manner of its operation. The Spirit of GOD works with and upon our Spirits in &s;uch a manner that we can't perceive any thing but the working of our own Minds, in the change that is wrought in them. The Spirit works &s;o &s;ecretly that we can perceive nothing in us but the free Exerci&s;e of our own rational powers. It is <HI>we our &s;elves</HI> that apprehend the evil of Sin, and the beauty of Chri&s;t, and the excellency of Religion: it is <HI>we our &s;elves</HI> that are &s;orry for Sins, and re&s;olute again&s;t them; <HI>we our &s;elves</HI> re&s;olve upon a reli|gious cour&s;e of life; and <HI>we our &s;elves</HI> take de|light in the ways of GOD: but now the&s;e good thoughts, and motions in our hearts how much &s;o

And now for GOD by the &s;ecret motions of his Spirit to work every good di&s;po&s;ition within us in &s;uch a manner that it can't be di&s;tingui&s;hed from our &s;elves; it &s;hows how un&s;earchable the ways of GOD are, and what an intimate Knowledge He has of, and what free acce&s;s He has to, and what power He has over our Spirits: which &s;hould lead us to fear and reverence Him, who&s;e great|ne&s;s is un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t finding out: yea, and to acknowledge Him in every good di&s;po&s;ition found in us, and in every good work performed by us; how much &s;o ever it appears to be of our &s;elves.</P>

and Liberty in this matter.

Sometimes GOD makes choice of the Rich, and oftentimes of the Poor of this World. Sometimes GOD Converts the le&s;s &s;inful &amp; &s;candalous, and &s;ometimes he pa&s;&s;eth by &s;uch, and &s;aves &s;ome of the Chief of Sinners.

Thus various is GOD in his be&s;towing Conver|ting Grace upon per&s;ons, not taking all, nor re|jecting all of any &s;ort of People whatever. And now the divine Wi&s;dom and Prudence appears in &s;uch a Conduct of him&s;elf. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By this GOD &s;hews his Sovereignty, and that Divine Grace is in his hands to di&s;pen&s;e it to whom&s;oever he plea&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain that GOD has &s;uch an ab&s;o|lute Sovereignty over the Children of Men as well as over the re&s;t of his Creatures as to deny, or di&s;pen&s;e his Grace to whom, and when, and where, and how he plea&s;es; he has right to have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom

he will to harden. Now it is highly proper that GOD &s;hould manife&s;t this Sovereignty which be|longs unto him, and let us know that he is not obliged to one more than to another; but that he may, and does do what he plea&s;es with his own, with the works of his own hands. And now GOD does mo&s;t fully di&s;cover <HI>this,</HI> in the vari|ous manners of his be&s;towing converting Grace. For by GOD's chu&s;ing &s;ome, and rejecting others of every &s;ort, we are utterly at a lo&s;s for any certain Rule that GOD goes by in be&s;towing his Grace, but that of his own Will. We find that outward Riches and Greatne&s;s don't move GOD to afford his &s;pecial Grace, becau&s;e we may &s;ee multitudes of &s;uch going on in their Sins. We al&s;o find that outward Poverty don't move GOD to Inrich them with his Grace; becau&s;e we &s;ee multitudes of &s;uch as poor on &s;piritual, as they are on temporal accounts. We al&s;o find that de&s;cending from godly Parents, and being fa|voured with a religious Education altho' the mo&s;t likely way of any, yet does not always &s;ucceed, becau&s;e many that have been as highly privi|leged on the&s;e accounts as any, have proved &s;ome of the vile&s;t and mo&s;t abominable Wretches in the World: So that we can't find any certain Rule that GOD goes by, but he takes one here, and another there, without any con&s;tant regard to Circum&s;tances, which naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to us that GOD herein Acts according to his &s;overeign Will &amp; Plea&s;ure. And now whatever will lead us to &s;ee and acknowledge the Divine Sovereignty in this matter, may be con&s;idered as an In&s;tance
<PB N="219" REF="002987_0224_0FE6B19EC4C534E8">
of Wi&s;dom, becau&s;e the Glory of GOD is very much concerned in our believing and acknow|ledging this Perfection of the Divine Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>This way of management &s;erves to convince us that our Conver&s;ion is not of our &s;elves, but of GOD; and that the glory of it belongs unto him.</HI></P>
<P>If only &s;uch Per&s;ons as de&s;cended from godly Parents, or lived in godly Families, and &s;o were favoured with a religious Education were Conver|ted, we &s;hould be ready to impute all to their Education and In&s;truction, and to the good Exam|ples that have been &s;et before them; and not think of it's being the immediate Operation of the Spirit of GOD. We &s;hould be ready to look up|on the&s;e Privileges not only as Means, but as the Cau&s;e of our Conver&s;ion, and &s;o GOD would not have the glory of this wonderful work a&s;cribed to him, to whom alone <HI>it doth appertain.</HI> But now GOD by Converting &s;ome that have de&s;cend|ed of wicked Parents, and have been de&s;titute of the advantages of a religious Education, or of having good Examples before them: And by his Converting &s;ome al&s;o in their Old Age, when they have by their long cu&s;tom in Sinning &s;trengthned the habits of it, &s;o as that it would be as ea&s;y for an Ethiopian to change his skin, and the Leopard his &s;pot, as for them to for&s;ake their evil ways, and turn to GOD of them&s;elves; I &s;ay, GOD by be&s;towing regenerating Grace upon &s;ome &s;uch, di&s;covers to us that it is not in the power of coun&s;els, cautions, admonitions, and good exam|ples to convert Men, but that when ever any are brought into &s;uch a State, the Spirit of GOD has
<PB N="220" REF="002987_0225_0FE6B19ED8107A08">
been at work upon them. And &s;o every one will be led to a&s;cribe this not to the power of means; but to the power of GOD, acknowledging to his glory, that it is not in the power of coun&s;els or examples, nor in the power of pious Parents to convey Grace to their Children: but that it is by the Grace of GOD that Converted ones <HI>are what they are</HI>; that they <HI>are &s;aved by grace, thro' faith, and that not of them&s;elves,</HI> nor of any In&s;truments, <HI>but it is the gift of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>GOD's be&s;towing regenerating Grace in &s;uch a, Promi&s;cuous manner, is very u&s;eful to pre|vent any from &s;inking into de&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P>For if &s;ome of all &s;orts be Converted. Rich as well as Poor, the Children of the wicked as well as of the godly; &s;ome of the greate&s;t Sinners as well as of the lea&s;t; then none have any rea&s;on to be entirely di&s;couraged. Indeed &s;ome that have often &s;tifled the checks and convictions of their own Con&s;ciences, grieved, and done de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace; they may perhaps have &s;o provoked GOD, as to be given up to their own hearts lu&s;ts, and &s;o the day of Grace may expire with them before the day of life. (<HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 81.12.) But none can certainly know this; and it is certain there have been In&s;tances of the Conver&s;ion of exceeding vile Sinners, and therefore one that is never &s;o great a Sinner knows not but he may be another In&s;tance wherein the mighty Power, and Grace of GOD &s;hall be mag|nifyed. So that con&s;idering what In&s;tances of Conver&s;ion there have been it may keep all even the vile&s;t Sinners from utter de&s;pair, which is of
<PB N="221" REF="002987_0226_0FE6B1A11C4D6068">
great Service, as it will prevent them from growing more de&s;perate in their &s;inful Cour&s;es, and prevent their giving over all Means that GOD has appointed for their Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4 I may add al&s;o, <HI>That this is a way to pre|vent Per&s;ons from having too great a dependance upon their particular Circum&s;tances.</HI></P>
<P>Men are exceeding apt to depend upon their particular Circum&s;tances&punc; and conclude from thence that they are or &s;hall be Converted. Thus the rich Man that is made to pro&s;per in the World, is ready to conclude with him&s;elf that GOD has &s;pecial Favour for him, and concludes that as GOD has ble&s;&s;ed him with temporal, &s;o he will al&s;o with &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. The poor Man he al&s;o depends very much upon his Circum&s;tances, pre&s;uming upon what the Apo|&s;tle &s;ays, of GOD's <HI>Choo&s;ing the poor of this world: make them rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom,</HI> Jam. 2.5. Others again have great dependance upon their Parentage, their being de&s;cended of godly Ance&s;tors, as if regenerating Grace run in the Blood, boa&s;ting as the proud Phari&s;ees &amp; Sadduces that they <HI>had Abraham to their Father.</HI> But now the manner of GOD's di&s;pen&s;ing regenerating Grace, will lead us to reject &s;uch Confidences as the&s;e; and teach us that the&s;e things are by no means to be depen|ded upon; and &s;o many a one is driven off from that pre&s;umptuous Hope, they would otherwi&s;e have peri&s;hed in.</P>
<P>And thus if we con&s;ider the order GOD ob|&s;erves in beginning this work of Grace in the
<PB N="222" REF="002987_0227_0FE6B1A132BBBF48">
Soul, the way of the Spirit's working this Grace within us, and the variety of Per&s;ons whom GOD makes choice of to be the Subjects of this Grace, we may &s;ee that it is all by Coun&s;el and the re&s;ult of con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;idered is, the Means made u&s;e of by GOD, in the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners, and the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears therein. But this I mu&s;t leave to another Op|portunity. And I &s;hall Conclude at pre&s;ent with a word or two by way of <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Since the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner is &s;uch a mighty Work as to require the Almighty Power of GOD to accompli&s;h it; let none of us be &s;o vain as to think this to be a work within our own Power.</HI></P>
<P>For (as we have heard) the turning a Sin|ner from darkne&s;s to light, and bringing him out of the Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of the Son of GOD, requires an Almighty Arm to accompli&s;h it. The &s;ame Power that gave Being to the World at fir&s;t, that rai&s;ed us up to a natural Life, mu&s;t rai&s;e us to a new &amp; &s;piritual Life. It is the Almighty Power of GOD which rai&s;ed up JESUS from the dead, mu&s;t make us to know him and the power of his Re&s;urrection and enable us to dye unto Sin, and live unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Therefore that Man is a great &s;tranger to him&s;elf, and to the greatne&s;s of this work, that imagines it may be performed by the &s;trength of Nature without the &s;pecial and &s;upernatural Grace of GOD, and he will &s;till re|main a &s;tranger to this work in his own Soul, &s;o long as he engages in it in his own Strength.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="223" REF="002987_0228_0FE6B1AD5B02C798">2. <HI>What we have heard of the Order in which GOD proceeds in the Converting a Sinner, af|fords one Mark to know whether we are in a Con|verted State or no.</HI></P>
<P>Namely, <HI>Our being wrought on by Grace after the manner mention'd.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that GOD does is to enligh|ten the Mind, by which he per&s;wades the Will, and excites the Affections. Now therefore if we would know whether we are Converted, we mu&s;t con&s;ider whether ever GOD has opened the Eyes of our Minds: Have we another &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of &s;piritual things than in times pa&s;t?

Do we &s;ee Chri&s;t in his beauty &amp; glory? Do we &s;ee our need of him, and his fulne&s;s &amp; &s;ufficiency for us in &s;uch a manner as to embrace him with all our hearts as our Prince &amp; Saviour? La&s;tly, Have we ever &s;een &s;o much of the beauty of Holine&s;s, and of the holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and good|ne&s;s of the divine Commandments, as to make Choice of them for the Rule of our Lives? Now when we find our Minds thus enlightned as to have &s;uch a &s;piritual di&s;cerning of &s;piritual things, we may conclude there is a work of Grace begun. But until we find &s;uch an appre|hen&s;ion &amp; di&s;cerning of &s;piritual things we may conclude we are in a State of Nature, what|ever pangs of Affections and Devotion we may

&s;eem to have at &s;ome particular Sea&s;ons; for if our Affections are not &s;tirred up from &s;uch &s;pi|ritual views &amp; apprehen&s;ions of &s;piritual things, they are &s;tirred up by Nature and not by Grace: for Grace begins with the Under&s;tanding, the leading Faculty of the Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Since GOD deals &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly in be|&s;towing converting Grace, let none be di&s;coura|ged; but let us all tru&s;t in him, and hope in his Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' we can find nothing in our &s;elves to recommend us to him, yet we may hope for his Grace; for it is nothing that he &s;ees in any that moves him to be&s;tow his Grace upon them, but it is all owing to his &s;overeign Will &amp; Plea&s;ure: and therefore altho' we are never &s;o Unworthy, GOD may have Mercy on us, and turn us unto him&s;elf; nay &s;ometimes he chu&s;es &s;uch to make his Power and his Grace the more manife&s;t and con&s;picuous. And altho' it would be mo&s;t hor|rible perver&s;ene&s;s in any to go on in Sin that Grace might abound, yet when we have gone very far in Sin, it may give us &s;ome Encourage|ment to hope in GOD who&s;e Mercies are Infi|nite, and who can as ea&s;ily Convert one Sinner as another.</P>

<P>Surely the glory of it all belongs unto him; let us then give him the glory due unto his Name. Don't be &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine that becau&s;e you did not perceive the motions of the Holy Gho&s;t, di&s;tinct from the natural motions

But con&s;ider how &s;ecretly the holy Spirit works in and upon our Spirits: therefore where ever we find the work wrought within us, in how natural and unperceptible a way &s;o ever it has been performed; yet be &s;ure to acknowledge it as the work of GOD, and that it is he that has wrought in us both to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And let us a&s;cribe it to him as an act of free, and &s;overeign Grace.

<P>THE point I am upon is the Regeneration and Conver&s;ion of a Sinner, and to ob&s;erve the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears therein. And here I have already con&s;idered the work it &s;elf, and &s;hewn how much it manife&s;ts the glory of GOD, e&s;pecially the glory of his Power, and of

his Grace: and &s;o the Wi&s;dom of GOD that he is plea&s;ed to perform &s;uch a mighty work as the Converting and Changing the hearts of Sinners. I have al&s;o in the next place con&s;idered the Or|der, Method and Manner of GOD in performing this work; that is, I have &s;hewn how, and where he begins this work in the Soul; namely, in the Under&s;tanding, enlightning that, and then per|&s;wading the Will: and that this work is perfor|med by the &s;ecret, unperceptible operations of the holy Spirit, and that GOD makes choice of a great variety of per&s;ons on whom to be&s;tow this Con|verting and Saving Grace, even &s;ome of all &s;orts, in all which I &s;hewed there is a great deal of Wi&s;|dom and Contrivance.</P>
<P>Now what remains is to con&s;ider the Outward Means made u&s;e of by GOD in the Conver&s;ion and Sanctification of Sinners. So then,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If we con&s;ider the Means made u&s;e of by GOD in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, we &s;hall &s;ee much of the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</HI></P>
<P>Under this head, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the Wi&s;dom of GOD,</P>
<P N="1">1. In making u&s;e of any Means at all in our <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In the Manner of making u&s;e of them, and how far he makes u&s;e of them in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Means them&s;elves, the &s;uitablene&s;s of them to an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed for them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider the Wi&s;dom of GOD in appoin|ting &s;ome Outward Means to be attended by usin order to our Conver&s;ion, and our progre&s;s in Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Sanctification.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="002987_0232_0FE6B1B91A2928A8">That GOD is able to Convert a Sinner by an act of his immediate Power, without the help of Means, and Second Cau&s;es, none can doubt of who believe that Almighty Power belongs unto him, nor is it much to be doubted, that GOD has done &s;o. The Conver&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems to have been an in&s;tance; for he was not brought to believe in Chri&s;t from any arguments, or com|mon Means that were u&s;ed, which by the &s;ecret workings of the Spirit proved effectual on him: but notwith&s;tanding all the common Means that had been u&s;ed with him; he was as bitter again&s;t the Chri&s;tians as ever, and was in his rage hurry|ing to <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to per&s;ecute them; but GOD Converted him at once as he was on his way, by a miraculous Light from Heaven that &s;hown round about him, and by a more glorious Light that &s;hone into him, giving <HI>him the light of the know|ledge of the glory of GOD in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>: without any u&s;e of the ordinary Means: but this is not the common way in which GOD Converts Sinners unto him&s;elf; but it is by the u&s;e of certain Means that he has in&s;tituted and appointed for that End. Thus Prayer is an in|&s;tituted Means of Grace by which we may obtain the holy Spirit in the Regenerating and Sancti|fying Influences of it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.13. The word of GOD is al&s;o &s;poken of as a Means made u&s;e of for our Regeneration. Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth.</HI> And this mu&s;t be by our Hearing of it, and attending to it. For as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Rom 10.17. <HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="002987_0233_0FE6B1B92D74B418">
Other means of Grace al&s;o are appointed for us, which I &s;hall take particular Notice of before I fini&s;h the point under con&s;ideration; by all which it appears that GOD has appointed certain Means to be made u&s;e of for begetting and in|crea&s;ing a principle of Grace in the Soul: and now here is Wi&s;dom and Prudence. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the fir&s;t place, the Power of GOD is as much manife&s;ted in the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner, in the u&s;e of Outward Means, as if he &s;hould do it by an Immediate act of his Power, without the concur|rence of Second Cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The Converting or Changing the heart of a Sinner, is &s;uch a work as will always require Al|mighty Power to accompli&s;h it: and therefore let it be done by an Immediate act, or in the u&s;e of Means, yet &s;uch a Power mu&s;t and will be mani|fe&s;ted therein. GOD's making u&s;e of Means, and obliging us to attend upon them don't prevent his exerting the &s;ame Almighty Power, as if he &s;hould do it at once by an immediate Voice, or Light from Heaven: For unle&s;s the Almighty Spirit of GOD accompany the Outward Means to give life, and efficacy to them, they would ne|ver be able to Convert a Sinner; but tho&s;e who have the riche&s;t and mo&s;t plentiful enjoyment of Outward Means would remain in their Sins, of which we have innumerable In&s;tances. So that every one that &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders of it, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have experienced this mighty work of Grace in their own Souls, will be &s;en&s;ible of, and obliged to acknowledge, that how u&s;eful &s;oever Outward Means have been, the change has
<PB N="229" REF="002987_0234_0FE6B1BBE02D6188">
been wrought in them by the power of the <HI>divine Spirit,</HI> that the &s;ame Almighty power which com|manded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s at fir&s;t, has cau&s;ed it to &s;hine into their Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is wi&s;ely contrived by GOD to make u&s;e of certain means in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, <HI>as herein the work of the Spirit is carryed on in a Secret, Unperceptible way, altogether agreable to, and in Concurrence with our Natural Powers and Faculties.</HI></P>
<P>If the Conver&s;ion of Sinners &s;hou'd be brought about in &s;uch a &s;udden, immediate &amp; vi&s;ible manner from Heaven, as that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> it would be like the other miraculous operations of the holy Spirit, and not in that &s;till and &s;ecret way which the holy Gho&s;t de&s;igned to work in, and upon us. Our Saviour tells us that, that the <HI>Kingdom of God that is within men,</HI> that is &s;et up in Mens hearts, <HI>cometh not with ob&s;ervation,</HI> Luk. 17.20. It was not to come with outward &s;hew, in &s;uch a vi&s;ible, and glorious manner as to be ob&s;erved in its coming; but it was to come within Men, to be wrought in Mens hearts in &s;uch a &s;ecret manner as not to be ob&s;erved by others till it manife&s;ted it &s;elf by the ble&s;&s;ed Effects of it in Mens lives.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the work was wrought in an im|mediate Manner, there would not be the u&s;e of our natural and rational Powers &amp; Faculties, nor any concurrence of our own Endeavours, but we &s;hould &s;eem to be wholly Unconcerned about the matter: but now by the u&s;e of Means, altho' the Spirit works the change in our hearts as really and truly as if he did it without Means, yet now we
<PB N="230" REF="002987_0235_0FE6B1BBF4A96648">
&s;ome way or other concur, and are concerned in the work. By there being Means appointed we have the opportunity of Exerci&s;ing our own na|tural Powers of Judgment and Choice: By there being Means made u&s;e of we have the opportunity of being inlightned &amp; in&s;tructed in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uty in a natural, rational way without any immediate extraordinary revelation from Heaven to us in particular. By the Means appointed we have life and death, ble&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng and cur&s;ing &s;et before us, and the opportunity of chu&s;ing or refu&s;ing. And &s;o indeed, altho' GOD in the work of Conver&s;ion does really work in us both to Will and to Do of his own good plea&s;ure; yet we may be &s;aid in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to work out our own Salvation. And it is highly proper, and &s;o wi&s;ely ordered by GOD, that it &s;hould be &s;o, con&s;idering that Heaven is pro|po&s;ed as a reward, and Hell con&s;idered as a pun|i&s;hment, and that we &s;hall be &s;entenced to one of the&s;e, according as we do, or do not comply with the terms of Salvation propo&s;ed to us.</P>
<P>And this leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. In the third place, That it is wi&s;ely ordered by GOD to make u&s;e of Means in the work of Conver&s;ion, <HI>as it puts the affair of our Conver&s;ion &s;o much in our own hands as to render us utterly inexcu&s;able if we are not Converted, and &s;o will vindicate the Ju&s;tice of GOD in the &s;entence of Condemnation he &s;hall pronounce upon all &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>Were no &s;ort of Outward or ordinary Means appointed to be made u&s;e of by us in order to our Conver&s;ion; but if GOD &s;hould &s;trike down one at one time, and another at another time by a
<PB N="231" REF="002987_0236_0FE6B1C7DB0079C0">
vi&s;ible appearance, and audible voice from Hea|ven, even perhaps when they were in their full Career of wickedne&s;s, in&s;tead of being attendent upon him in any duty&punc; I &s;ay, if this were the con&s;tant method of Converting Sinners, Men would have nothing to do towards their own Con|ver&s;ion, they would not have any tendency to|wards it: and then one Cour&s;e of life would bid as fair for Conver&s;ion as another for ought we know. And now in this ca&s;e, if a per&s;on remained Uncon|verted, it could not be looked upon as a crime, but an unhappine&s;s that he was pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;o the Ju&s;tice of GOD could not appear &s;o clear in pun|i&s;hing him for remaining in an Unconverted E&s;tate, becau&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to know, much le&s;s to do any thing that has &s;o much as a tendency towards it. But now by GOD's ap|pointing certain Means to be made u&s;e of, and at|tended by us in order to our Conver&s;ion, he does in &s;ome &s;en&s;e put it into our own power, and leaves it to our choice, whether we will be Converted or no. For altho' Conver&s;ion be altogether the work of GOD; yet the making u&s;e of the&s;e Means wherein he is wont to convey &s;aving Grace to the Soul, is in our power who live under the free En|joyment of them. Thus for in&s;tance, GOD ap|points the <HI>Reading &amp; Hearing the Word</HI> as Means of our Conver&s;ion, now this we can attend upon; it is as much in our power as any natural Action that we perform, to Read the word of GOD, to go to his Hou&s;e, and &s;et under the Preaching of it. And as <HI>Prayer</HI> is another Means of Grace, &s;o this we are able al&s;o to attend upon. And therefore
<PB N="232" REF="002987_0237_0FE6B1C7EE5D3B70">
if we dont diligently and carefully attend upon the&s;e, and &s;uch like Means of Grace, it is our own fault: And &s;o it becomes our own fault that we are not Converted, becau&s;e we dont make u&s;e of the Means that GOD appoints for that End as we ought. And this will render every Man that lives, and dies in an Unconverted E&s;tate under the Means of Grace, utterly inexcu&s;able before GOD. For if the Sinner &s;hould plead he could not Convert him&s;elf; yet his Mouth will be &s;top'd wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;uch a reply as this from GOD, that he might have made a better u&s;e of the Means of Grace that were appointed, that he either neglected them, or was carele&s;s in his attending upon them. Other|wi&s;e he might have been Converted as well as others: and their de&s;truction will appear to be of them&s;elves, and their Condemnation very ju&s;t and equitable. And &s;urely it is the Wi&s;dom of GOD &s;o to order things, as that even in the ever|la&s;ting De&s;truction of the Ungodly, it will appear that Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment are the habita|tion of his Throne, and &s;o to have this &s;ung to his everla&s;ting honour, Ju&s;t &amp; True are all thy ways, thou King of Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I proceed to Con&s;ider the Manner of GOD's making u&s;e of Means in our Conver&s;ion,</HI> and the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears therein.</P>
<P>As it is an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom in GOD to make u&s;e of any Outward Means; &s;o this Wi&s;dom ap|pears more Con&s;picuous in the Manner of his making u&s;e of them: for he makes u&s;e of &s;uch Means, and no other, &s;o far, and no farther than will an&s;wer &s;ome very wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es.
<PB N="233" REF="002987_0238_0FE6B1C9444BB370">
Here I &s;hall mention a few particulars under this Head.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD's <HI>giving Succe&s;s &s;o frequently to the Means that he has appointed, and making them for the mo&s;t part the In&s;trument of our Conver&s;ion, di&s;|covers divine Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>When GOD Converts Sinners he does it for the mo&s;t part in and by the Means that he has appointed, they are generally the In&s;truments of our Conver&s;ion, and it is Wi&s;dom in GOD that it &s;hould be &s;o. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hereby GOD puts Honour upon his own In&s;titutions, and gives further Te&s;timony that they are means of his own Appointment.</HI></P>
<P>It is highly proper that GOD &s;hould put Honour upon his own In&s;titutions, and give con|vincing Evidence to us that they are from him, that &s;o we might Honour them by an high E|&s;teem of them, and a reverent and devout At|tendance on them. And now there is no way appears &s;o effectual for this, as the giving Suc|ce&s;s to the Means, and making them an&s;wer the propo&s;ed End of their In&s;titution. Thus for In&s;tance, how could GOD magnify his word and make it honourable any ways &s;o effectually, as by making it the In&s;trument of our Regene|ration &amp; Conver&s;ion? By cau&s;ing it to come with &s;uch demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with &s;uch Power as to enlighten our dark Minds, to enliven our dead Souls, and to make us <HI>wi&s;e unto Salvation?</HI> So again what greater honour can be done to the mini&s;terial In&s;titution, or what greater confirmation can be given of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="234" REF="002987_0239_0FE6B1C959B0CC28">
appointing an order of Men to di&s;pen&s;e his Word &amp; Ordinances, and of his being pre&s;ent with them, than is giving Succe&s;s to their Mini&s;try; and making them the In&s;truments of turning Men from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD? The&s;e are &s;eals of their Mini&s;try, proofs &amp; confirmations of their Commi&s;&s;ion's being received from CHRIST the King and Head of the Church: and &s;o any of the divine Ordinances when they are accompanied with the mighty Power of GOD &s;o as to convert Sinners &amp; edify Saints, it honours the Ordinances and &s;hews that GOD is with us of a truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD's giving Succe&s;s to Means <HI>leads us highly to Prize and Value them, and to be more Thankful for them.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;ee the Means of Grace prove ef|fectual for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, when we find the Ordinances to be quick &amp; powerful, and by the Di&s;pen&s;ations of them great additions made unto the Church of &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved, it will naturally lead us to an high E&s;teem of them, to look upon them as very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o an un&s;peakable Favour to enjoy them. For what can be a greater Ble&s;&s;ing than to enjoy tho&s;e Means which (with the Concur|rence of the divine Power which is wont to at|tend them) are able to &s;ave our Souls? There|fore if we have any regard for our precious and immortal Souls, we &s;hall have an high e&s;teem for tho&s;e Means &amp; In&s;truments that GOD will own and ble&s;s for their Salvation. We &s;hall
<PB N="235" REF="002987_0240_0FE6B1D4E601E778">
be enlarged in greater Thankfulne&s;s for them than for any outward good things what&s;oever. This will put Men upon prai&s;ing the Lord for giving them his Statutes and his Judgments; this will put them upon ble&s;&s;ing the GOD and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for ble&s;&s;ing them with &s;uch &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and &s;o GOD will have the glory due unto his Name for the&s;e Means, as well as we the benefit &amp; advantage of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. GOD's giving Succe&s;s to his own in&s;tituted Means well &s;erve this good End, <HI>That it will Encourage us to the more diligent Attendance upon them, as being the mo&s;t, yea the only likely way of obtaining converting Grace.</HI></P>
<P>When the Word, Ordinances, and all the Means of Grace have little or no good Effect upon Per&s;ons, when tho&s;e that attend upon them are no better than tho&s;e that neglect them, it becomes a &s;tumbling block to many; they are apt to entertain &s;lighty thoughts of the Means them&s;elves as if they were in&s;ignificant, and are ready to &s;ay, It is in vain to wait upon GOD in them. But now when we &s;ee the divine Ble&s;&s;ing accompanying the outward Means of Grace, &s;o as that many Sinners are Converted, and Converts are filled with Righteou&s;ne&s;s by them; when we &s;ee them <HI>flouri&s;h in the Courts of our God, that are planted in the hou&s;e of the Lord</HI>: It will convince us of the Advantage of attending divine Ordinances, the Sin and Folly of neglecting them, and it will Encourage us to be waiting upon GOD in the ways of his
<PB N="236" REF="002987_0241_0FE6B1D4FA5BA2E0">
appointment, if we have any regard for our Souls, or any concern for being brought into a State of Grace. Surely when we &s;ee that they are ble&s;&s;ed who watch daily at Wi&s;dom's Gates, waiting at the Po&s;ts of her Doors, it will en|courage us to do likewi&s;e; we &s;hall be encoura|ged to go with them that keep holy Days, to the mountains of Zion, to the Hou&s;e of the GOD of Jacob, where the Lord commands the Ble&s;&s;ing. But I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. That as it is Wi&s;dom in GOD to give Suc|ce&s;s for the mo&s;t part to the Means appointed, &s;o on the other hand it is al&s;o Wi&s;dom in him &s;ometimes <HI>to Deny his Ble&s;&s;ing with Means, or at lea&s;t not to give &s;ucce&s;s always in proportion to the outward Means enjoyed.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' GOD does for the mo&s;t part, yet he does not always tye him&s;elf up to his in&s;tituted Means in be&s;towing converting Grace. Some|time he works without the common Means, as in the forementioned In&s;tance of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI> But whether there be any &s;uch In&s;tances as <HI>that,</HI> now a days, yet this is mo&s;t certain, that GOD does not always &s;ucceed the Means of Grace in the &s;ame degree &amp; mea&s;ure, nor in any exact proportion to what Means are enjoy|ed. This we often find that the &s;ame Means are to &s;ome a &s;avour of Life unto Life, and a &s;avour of Death unto Death to others. We find that the Word &amp; Ordinances, altho' di&s;pen&s;ed and admini&s;tred as faithfully in one Place as in ano|ther, yet not with the like Succe&s;s, no nor with the like Succe&s;s in the &s;ame Place. Sometimes
<PB N="237" REF="002987_0242_0FE6B1D64B7D4CA8">
the number of Converts increa&s;es daily under the Means of Grace; and at another time altho' the &s;ame Means are u&s;ed, the &s;ame Word prea|ched, the &s;ame Care &amp; Watchfulne&s;s exerci&s;ed over the Flock, yet the Mini&s;ter will have occa|&s;ion to complain, that he labours in vain and &s;pends his &s;trength for nought. Nay it may be ob&s;erved further, That among tho&s;e who enjoy the riche&s;t Means, and are mo&s;t plentifully fed with Knowledge &amp; Under&s;tanding, by the mo&s;t burning &amp; &s;hining Lights, the able&s;t Mini&s;ters of the New-Te&s;tament, eminently qualified aright to divide the Word of Truth; and who are careful to give to every one their portion in due Sea&s;on, yet there is not &s;uch Increa&s;e of Converts, as in &s;ome other Places where they are not favoured with &s;uch precious Means, nor with one to go in and out before them &s;o eminently gifted and qualifyed for that Ser|vice. Oftentimes an hone&s;t, but weak and or|dinary Preacher, &s;hall do more good with his Preaching than the mo&s;t learned and judicious Divine. Nay we may ob&s;erve further &s;till even with re&s;pect to our &s;elves, that the very &s;ame Word or Ordinance has not always the &s;ame Effect &amp; Influence upon us. There are &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Word of GOD, that we have perhaps oftentimes heard &amp; read, and they have had no manner of Effect upon us; and yet at another time the &s;ame Word will migh|tily affect our Hearts, and perhaps prove the Means of our Conver&s;ion. So on the other hand, what may very much affect us at one time,
<PB N="238" REF="002987_0243_0FE6B1D660DEE2F0">
may be very awakening to our Con&s;ciences, and may warm our Affections, and excite our Devoti|ons; may yet at another time have no manner of Effect upon us. Now GOD's dealing in &s;uch a various manner, &s;ometimes with-holding as well as at others affording Succe&s;s to the Means, is a wi&s;e Contrivance. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This &s;erves to prevent our depending too much upon outward Means, as if there was power or vertue in them to Convert us.</HI></P>
<P>We are all exceeding prone to tru&s;t to out|ward Means, and depend on &s;econd Cau&s;es. If per&s;ons do but enjoy the Means of Grace, if they &s;et under an eminent Preacher, and give their con&s;tant Attendance upon divine Ordi|naces, they are apt to depend upon them, and think their Condition &s;afe, and look no further, concluding the&s;e will be able to &s;ave their Souls. But now, GOD by not always proportioning the Succe&s;s according to the Excellency of the Means, teaches us that Means are of them&s;elves a vain thing to tru&s;t unto. GOD by with-hol|ding a Ble&s;&s;ing &s;ometimes from the be&s;t of Means, when he affords a remarkable Ble&s;&s;ing to more ordinary Means, plainly &s;hews us that there is no real vertue in the outward Means, that they are dead &amp; ineffectual of them&s;elves, and are utterly unable of their own power to convey any &s;aving Grace into the Soul. For if the Vertue was in the Means them&s;elves, then the be&s;t Means would always prove the mo&s;t powerful: but becau&s;e we often &s;ee the con|trary, it affords &s;ufficient Evidence that the
<PB N="239" REF="002987_0244_0FE6B1D8A5A81F18">
Vertue and Power is not in the Means, and affords a &s;ufficient Caution again&s;t depending upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This leads us to have all our dependance upon GOD notwith&s;tanding the Means, and to give the glory of our Conver&s;ion to him alone.</HI></P>
<P>For when the Means of Grace are not &s;uc|ceded according to the degree &amp; mea&s;ure of them Enjoyed; when the riche&s;t Means, and the mo&s;t plentiful Enjoyment of them fail of Succe&s;s equal to more Inferiour Means and a greater Scarcity of them: As it &s;hews the Ver|tue is not in the Means, &s;o it makes it very evident that all the &s;aving Efficacy is from GOD, and that it is entirely depending on GOD whe|ther Means &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful or un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that when any have been Converted by out|ward Means, tho&s;e Means have been accompa|nied with a &s;pecial Ble&s;&s;ing from GOD, even the powerful Operations of the divine Spirit. So that this way of managing leads or at lea&s;t has a natural tendency to lead every Per&s;on to wait upon GOD for his Ble&s;&s;ing upon the Means of Grace they enjoy, and whenever they prove effectual for Salvation, to pa&s;s over the Means in a thankful Acknowledgment of GOD for them, and to give the Glory of all to him: This will lead us to a&s;cribe not to Means, but to GOD, acknowledging to his Glory, that how u&s;eful &s;oever Means have been, yet that it is GOD that works the &s;aving Change, that it is he that Creates the clean Heart, and Renews the right Spirit within us, and &s;o in this way GOD
<PB N="240" REF="002987_0245_0FE6B1D8B9DD8D88">
the Efficient Cau&s;e of our Regeneration will have the Glory of his own work rendred to him, where|as otherwi&s;e it would be mo&s;t likely to be paid to the In&s;truments, made u&s;e of by him therein.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another In&s;tance of the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the Manner of making u&s;e of Means, <HI>Is his Con|fining us to the particular Means that he him&s;elf has appointed, and not allowing us to run after the Inventions of Men.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD has in&s;tituted and appointed certain Means in and by which he will convey his Grace to &s;uch as duly attend on them, has been already ob&s;erved. And now, as the&s;e divine In&s;titutions mu&s;t be carefully attended, in order to our re|ceiving the Regenerating Grace of GOD, &s;o no other Means, no humane Inventions may be at|tended with any Expectation of meeting with the divine Grace in them. Altho' GOD is very ready to convey his Grace, yet it mu&s;t be in the chan|nels that he him&s;elf has made for it to flow in. If we would draw the waters of life, it mu&s;t be out of the&s;e Wells of Salvation that GOD has dug for us, it mu&s;t be out of the&s;e Ordinances that are appointed by Chri&s;t for us, &amp; not out of tho&s;e that are but humane Inventions. GOD confines his Graces to his own Ordinances, them he will own &amp; ble&s;s, but the multiplying Ordinances, and Ceremonies of our own Invention in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, how plau&s;ible &s;o ever they may be, yet is far from being plea&s;ing to GOD, or any way profitable to us. He in&s;i&s;ts upon our waiting upon him in the particular ways that he has pre|&s;cribed in order to our obtaining his Grace: And
<PB N="241" REF="002987_0246_0FE6B1DD8B8CCD68">
altho' another way may appear as likely in the natural tendency of it, yet it will by no means an&s;wer the End. The Rivers of <HI>Dama&s;cus, Pher|phar</HI> and <HI>Abana,</HI> had doubtle&s;s as much natural vertue in them, as the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> to cure the Lepro&s;y; but <HI>Naaman</HI> the Syrian mu&s;t bath him|&s;elf in <HI>Jordan,</HI> if he would be clean&s;ed, becau&s;e this was the divine Pre&s;cription, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 5 10. And thus GOD expects &amp; requires that in order to obtain his Grace, we &s;hould wait upon him in tho&s;e particular ways that he has pre&s;cribed in his Word, and no other. The Commi&s;&s;ion to the A|po&s;tles, was to teach them to ob&s;erve all things that Chri&s;t had Commanded them, and nothing more, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.20. They were not to tran&s;gre&s;s the Commandments of GOD by their Traditions, as the Phari&s;ees did, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.3. For our Saviour &s;ays, in vain do they wor&s;hip him, that <HI>teach for doctrines the Commandments of men,</HI> as in the 9th. <HI>v.</HI> of that Chapter; that is, To wor&s;hip GOD in a way that is only taught by Men, and no where pre&s;cribed by GOD, is a vain wor&s;hip. In &s;hort, the Word of GOD is the Directory for divine Wor&s;hip, and there mu&s;t we re&s;ort for di|rection at all times; and therefore the Inquiry ought to be not &s;o much, What &s;aith the Church? or what &s;ay the Fathers? or what &s;ays humane Rea&s;on? but <HI>what &s;aith the Scripture</HI>? Therein we are taught what is good, and all that the Lord our GOD requires of us&punc; and we mu&s;t clo&s;ely ad|here to the divine Pre&s;criptions therein, and not multiply Ordinances &amp; Ceremonies, under a vain pretence of plea&s;ing GOD thereby, or of being in a
<PB N="242" REF="002987_0247_0FE6B1DDA464BA08">
more likely way to obtain his Grace. That ge|neral Command, <HI>Deut.</HI> 12.32. is as applicable (from the general rea&s;on of it) to tho&s;e under the Chri&s;tian, as to tho&s;e under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;a|tion, <HI>What things &s;oever I Command you, ob&s;erve to do it, thou &s;halt not add thereto, nor dimini&s;h from it.</HI> And now here is Wi&s;dom. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD knows infinitely better than we, what Means of Grace are most proper, and &s;uitable for us to attend upon.</HI></P>
<P>GOD who has a perfect knowledge of him&s;elf, of us, and of all things el&s;e, mu&s;t needs know be&s;t, which way is the mo&s;t proper for us to wait upon him in, and which the mo&s;t &s;uitable way for him to convey his Grace to us: and therefore it is wi&s;ely, as well as graciou&s;ly done in him to pre|&s;cribe the way him&s;elf, &amp; not leave it to us.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is Wi&s;dom in GOD to confine us to the Means &amp; Ways of Wor&s;hip that he has pre&s;cribed, <HI>Becau&s;e of the vain, fooli&s;h and extravagant di&s;|po&s;ition there is in the heart of Man, with re&s;pect to the Modes of Religious Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed it is the temper of &s;ome Men to neglect all Means of Grace, they are for &s;itting &s;till, till GOD &s;hall by an immediate act of his Power work the mighty Change within them: They are not for attending any Ordinances, but expect the Motions of the Spirit of GOD without it. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that GOD &s;hould him&s;elf pre&s;cribe the Ordinances, and Means of Grace, to quicken &s;uch to attend upon them, as ever they ex|pect to meet with the divine Grace. But then on the other hand, it is the temper of a great part of
<PB N="243" REF="002987_0248_0FE6B1E9F7AE74A0">
Mankind to abound in religious Ceremonies, they are full of their own Inventions, and are for mul|tiplying religious Ordinances beyond what GOD has pre&s;cribed, thinking to honour &amp; plea&s;e GOD, or at lea&s;t to make &s;ome Atonement for their de|fects in moral Duties, by adding to his Ordinances, and doing more in that way than he requires. We find by Hi&s;tory and Ob&s;ervation, that not only the Ignorant Nations, who have only the light of Nature to guide them, have run into the Super|&s;titious ob&s;ervance of a multitude of the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and ridiculous Ceremonies in Religion, but that even tho&s;e who have had the light of Scrip|ture to guide them, yet when they have gone off from the divine Directory therein, and have been for adding &s;omething of their own Invention to the divine Ordinances, they have by degrees run into as idle, ridiculous and extravagant Ceremo|nies as the mo&s;t ignorant Heathen. Thus it was with the Nation of the Jews, they were in their degenerate State continually di&s;po&s;ed to add to the divine In&s;titutions, one Ceremony to another of their own, till they came to that Condition they were in, when our Saviour complains of them, for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Commandments of GOD by their tradition; for running all their Religion into meer formality, and empty Cere|mony, &s;uch as their frequent wa&s;hing their hands, their cups and platters, their Super&s;titious re|fraining from eating with Publicans and Sinners, their Super&s;titious building up the Tombs, and garni&s;hing the Sepulchres of the ancient Prophets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o we find among them that call them|&s;elves
<PB N="244" REF="002987_0249_0FE6B1EA0F612240">
Chri&s;tians, that by their not confining them|&s;elves to the Means, the Ordinances, that Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles had appointed, but giving way to their own corrupt and carnal rea&s;oning&punc; they have run unto as burden&s;om Ceremonies, as they of the Jewi&s;h Nation. To in&s;tance particularly in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> how many vain, burden|&s;ome, and ridiculous Ceremonies, yea what gro&s;s Super&s;tition and Idolatry have crept into it, by their not adhering to the Scripture directory, but following their own Inventions. Which &s;erves to &s;et forth the divine Wi&s;dom and Prudence, in pre&s;cribing certain Means and Ordinances for us, and limiting us to them, and not allowing us to follow our own fooli&s;h Imaginations. For in &s;hort, vain Man would be wi&s;e tho' he be born as the wild a&s;&s;es Colt: We are wi&s;e in our own conceit, we are apt to imagine there are many ways of plea&s;ing GOD, be&s;ides tho&s;e that he has pre&s;cri|bed: we are ready to think &s;uch a Ceremony and &s;uch a Formality in our religious Wor&s;hip would plea&s;e the Almighty, would help our devotion and would have a more natural tendency to beget, and to increa&s;e Grace within us, than barely tho&s;e plain &amp; &s;imple Means that GOD has pre&s;cribed. And by what we have &s;een of others we may be &s;atisfyed that if GOD had not given us a general directory how, and after what manner we mu&s;t wait upon him for his Grace, we &s;hould quickly in|tangle our &s;elves in as heavy a yoke of bondage as that of the Mo&s;aical di&s;pen&s;ation; in&s;tead of &s;tand|ing fa&s;t in the liberty where-with Chri&s;t has made us free. By which it appears how thorowly GOD

<P N="1">1. Is GOD plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of Outward Means in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners? Hence <HI>the &s;ad Condition they are in who are de&s;titute of the Means of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Such are without the Means of Conver&s;ion and Salvation, and this is the ca&s;e of the Heathen World that have not the Go&s;pel, nor the Ordinan|ces of it, they are peri&s;hing for lack of vi&s;ion; they are in a peri&s;hing State becau&s;e they are de&s;titute of the Means of obtaining that Faith in Chri&s;t which is nece&s;&s;ary according to the tenor of the Go&s;pel for our Salvation: For how &s;hould they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher, and how &s;hall they Preach unle&s;s they be &s;ent? Wherefore we &s;hould pity &s;uch Regi|ons of darkne&s;s, and &s;hould pour out our Souls in Prayer to GOD for them, that he would find out ways for their coming to the knowledge of him,

that he would rai&s;e up, and &s;end forth &s;uch as &s;hall carry the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel (the appointed Means of knowledge) to them.</P>

<P>We are highly favoured of the Lord with re|&s;pect to the Means of Grace that GOD gives us richly &amp; freely to enjoy, but it mu&s;t be &s;poken to the &s;hame of many, that they are very carele&s;s in the Improvement of them.

Now &s;uch are inexcu&s;able whoever they are, and ju&s;tly reprovable; this is to de&s;pi&s;e and neglect the way that GOD him&s;elf has appointed for your Conver&s;ion, and &s;urely you cant expect to obtain Converting Grace in any other way: for altho' GOD can be&s;tow this Grace without the help of Outward Means, yet you have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on in the world to expect it who live either in the wilful or carele&s;s neglect of the Means that he has appointed.</P>

<P>We find the Outward Means of Grace by their

Unle&s;s we do &s;o, it is in vain to attend upon them: for unle&s;s he ble&s;&s;es them, they can be of no &s;aving Good &amp; Benefit to us. Therefore when ever we are about to attend upon any of the In&s;tituted Means of Grace, we &s;hould hum|bly acknowledge &amp; profe&s;s, that we don't de|pend upon the Means them&s;elves, but upon him that has appointed them. Accordingly when ever we are about to read, or hear the Word of GOD, or attend upon the holy Sacrament, our Eyes and our Hearts &s;hould be up unto GOD for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his own In&s;titutions, and this is the way to meet with GOD in his Ordinances. This is the way to receive a Ble&s;&s;ing from the Lord, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s from the GOD of our Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What we have heard of GOD's</HI> Confining <HI>us to the Means of his own Appointment, teaches us the In&s;ignificancy of all humane Inventions in order to our obtaining the Grace of GOD.</HI> It has been too much the temper &amp; di&s;po&s;ition of the Church of GOD in all Ages, but e&s;pecially in the degenerate Ages of it, to be making &s;ome additions of their own Invention in the Wor|&s;hip of GOD, when the Life of Godline&s;s has

And &s;ometimes indeed from an indi&s;creet Zeal, and from &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Notions with re|&s;pect to the Almighty, Per&s;ons have been exci|ted al&s;o to make &s;ome Additions to the ways of Wor&s;hip that GOD has In&s;tituted. But now &s;ince GOD in his great Wi&s;dom is plea&s;ed to confine us to the Means of his own appointment, all &s;uch Inventions of Men mu&s;t needs be vain and in&s;ignificant; and how plau&s;ible &s;o ever the Arguments may be that are offered for them, yet they can't by any means be ju&s;tifyed, nor is there any foundation to expect to meet with the divine Grace in our attendance upon them. For in our attending on the Means of Grace, &s;o as to receive any Benefit by them, two things &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary:</P>

<P><PB N="249" REF="002987_0254_0FE6B1F958925FF0">For they are far from having the like Encou|ragement of meeting with the Spirit of GOD in humane Inventions, as in the divine In&s;titu|tions: Nay GOD having always &s;hown his di&s;|plea&s;ure at unin&s;tituted Ceremonies in Religion, there is abundant rea&s;on to conclude that his Spirit will not accompany them; and &s;o they can't be attended with Faith &amp; Dependance upon GOD for his Ble&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t not with any &s;ufficient foundation for &s;uch a Faith. But then further. The grounds and foundations for adding any Ceremonies of our own in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, to the divine In&s;titutes, is what will naturally draw us off from exer|ci&s;ing that dependance upon GOD for his Ble&s;&s;ing in order to their an&s;wering the End pro|po&s;ed; for upon Inquiry it will be found that the be&s;t and mo&s;t plau&s;ible Argument for adding any humane Ceremonies in divine Wor&s;hip, is, <HI>The natural aptitude &amp; fitne&s;s of them to Compo&s;e our Spirits, to &s;tir up our Affections, and to quicken our Devotion.</HI> They will plead for &s;uch or &s;uch a Ceremony, that is a very &s;ignificant one, that it has a natural tendency to help Men's Devo|tions. But now this Argument naturally di|verts &amp; hinders that dependance upon GOD for the Influences of his Spirit, which there ought always to be.

<P N="3">3. I now proceed in the third place to con&s;i|der <HI>the Means them&s;elves,</HI> the <HI>Propriety, &s;uita|blene&s;s &amp; &s;ufficiency of them to an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed for them,</HI> and &s;o the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears therein.</P>
<P>Now the outward Means of Grace may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into tho&s;e that GOD has expre&s;ly commanded us to attend upon, and tho&s;e which he in the cour&s;e of his Providence cau&s;es us to meet withal: <HI>i. e.</HI> The Means of Grace may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Providen|ces</HI>: For the Providences of GOD may be con|&s;idered as Means of Grace, as well as the Or|dinances of the Go&s;pel.

<P N="1">I. I &s;hall con&s;ider the <HI>divine Ordinances,</HI> or <HI>In&s;tituted Means of Grace,</HI> and the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears in them.</P>
<P>And here before I proceed to a particular Con&s;ideration of them, I would ob&s;erve in general, <HI>That they are plain, &s;imple &amp; ea&s;y Means.</HI> There is nothing ab&s;tru&s;e, intricate or difficult in them; they don't abound in number, there

are but few of them; they are not pompo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and co&s;tly, and &s;o are far from being difficult, or burden&s;om, but may very ea&s;ily be attended by us. They are not &s;o numerous or tedious as to be any great Interruption to our worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s; nor are they &s;o dark &amp; my&s;terious as to require any great Labour &amp; Pains to get a &s;ufficient Un|der&s;tanding of them. And now there being but a few plain and ea&s;y Means appointed by GOD for us to attend upon, is an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As it is an Encouragement to attend upon them, and leaves tho&s;e the more inexcu&s;able that neglect them.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed the proud heart of Man is &s;ometimes apt to de&s;pi&s;e the plainne&s;s &amp; &s;implicity of the Go&s;|pel-di&s;pen&s;ation. Men are apt to be plea&s;ed with a Religion more pompous, and attended with more co&s;tly and burden&s;ome Ceremonies: but yet it is mo&s;t certain that the more ea&s;y and plain the duties of Religion are, the more encouragement there is to attend upon them, and the le&s;s they have to &s;ay for their neglect.</P>
<P><HI>Naaman the Syrian</HI> was offended becau&s;e the Prophet directed to &s;o plain, &s;imple and ea&s;y a Method of cure, as that of wa&s;hing &s;even times in the waters of <HI>Jordan.</HI> But his Servants argu|ed very &s;trongly with him for his complying with &s;o ea&s;y a Method, &s;ince if he had required &s;ome great thing he would have done it. <HI>My Father</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>if the Prophet had bid thee do &s;ome great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then when he &s;aith unto thee, wa&s;h and be clean,</HI> 2 King. 5.13. So here, if GOD had
<PB N="254" REF="002987_0259_0FE6B204C060D8F8">
appointed many burden&s;ome Ordinances as he did under the law, we &s;hould have thought it rea|&s;onable for us to attend upon them; but how much rather now they are &s;o plain &amp; ea&s;y? What will any Per&s;on under the Go&s;pel have to plead for the neglect of the Means of Grace? Surely the plainne&s;s &amp; the ea&s;ine&s;s of them will render them inexcu&s;able; and now it is Wi&s;dom in GOD to leave &s;uch without excu&s;e, becau&s;e the more in|excu&s;able per&s;ons are, the more ju&s;t and righteous will GOD appear in Judging &amp; Condemning them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The plainne&s;s &amp; &s;implicity of the Means, <HI>has a tendency to prevent our &s;inking &s;o much into meer Formality, which otherwi&s;e we &s;hould be in danger of.</HI></P>
<P>The more numerous and pompous the Ordinan|ces are, the more apt Men are to re&s;t in the Out|ward form of the duty, and lo&s;e that temper and frame of Spirit, which is nece&s;&s;ary and preparato|ry for our receiving the divine Grace in and by the Ordinances. And I believe this may gene|rally be ob&s;erved, that as where the life &amp; power of Godline&s;s decrea&s;es, the more Ceremony and Formality in Religious Wor&s;hip is in&s;i&s;ted on: So when Religious Rites and Ceremonies prevail beyond what is Commanded, there the life and power of Religion decays: for at &s;uch times Mens hearts &amp; thoughts are &s;o taken up with the Form, that they leave the Sub&s;tance; their care will na|turally terminate in ob&s;erving the particular Form &amp; Mode, and when they have done that they are apt to re&s;t in it. And therefore GOD in his great Wi&s;dom pre&s;cribes &s;uch plain and &s;imple Means, that we might not tru&s;t to them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="255" REF="002987_0260_0FE6B20D228BA890">3. The more &s;imple and plain the Means are, by which GOD brings about our Conver&s;ion, <HI>the clearer Manife&s;tation there is of the Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Power is always manife&s;t according to the greatne&s;s of the work, and according to the weakne&s;s of the Means that he makes u&s;e of therein. The trea&s;ure of the Go&s;pel is, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, committed to earthen Ve&s;&s;els, to weak frail Men; to Men &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities with other Men; and what is the rea|&s;on of it? <HI>That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.7.</P>
<P>But thus much for the Means in general, and of the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the plainne&s;s, and &s;im|plicity of them.</P>
<P>I now proceed to con&s;ider the In&s;tituted Means of Grace them&s;elves, and the Propriety and Suita|blene&s;s of them, and &s;o the Wi&s;dom of GOD in appointing the&s;e very Means of Grace in particu|lar. Now the Means of Grace that I &s;hall take particular Notice of, are, the Written Word of GOD, the publick Mini&s;try of it by his Amba&s;&s;a|dors, Prayer, Singing of P&s;alms, Sabbaths and Sa|craments.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Written Word of GOD is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, in which there appears very much of the Wi&s;dom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>From the beginning of the World even until <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s time, there dont appear any Written Word; and the only way there was for conveying the knowledge of GOD and of Religion was by Oral Tradition: but when the Age of Man was &s;hort|ned, and there was a quicker &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Gene|rations,
<PB N="256" REF="002987_0261_0FE6B20D37C1C208">
Traditions grew &s;o uncertain, that GOD &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary, and did accordingly in his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s provide a &s;tanding Re|velation for his Church that &s;hould be more fixed and certain, and upon which they might &s;afely depend. For when he had made choice of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for his own peculiar People, he wrote to them the great things of his Law. As for a Summary of the moral Law which was to be a univer&s;al &amp; perpetual Rule for the Church, GOD him&s;elf wrote it in Ta|bles of Stone; and as for that Law that parti|cularly concerned the Jewi&s;h Church, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was commanded to commit it to Writing, <HI>Exod</HI> 34.27, 28. And whether Writing was ever known among Men before or no, yet we have no certain account of any &s;o ancient as tho&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> But &s;ince that, GOD has in the &s;eve|ral Ages of the Church till the Apo&s;tles Times, rai&s;ed up one &amp; another, who being under the Gui|dance &amp; In&s;piration of the holy Gho&s;t, have Com|po&s;ed all tho&s;e Books which make up the Scrip|tures of the old &amp; new Te&s;tament, collected in our Bibles; and now this is called the Word of GOD, becau&s;e it was <HI>given by In&s;piration of God: holy Men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.21. And now this Word is a Method appointed and made u&s;e of by GOD, for the Regeneration &amp; Conver&s;ion of Sinners, to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and to bring them out of the Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of the Son of GOD. Thus we find it declared to be a Means of our Regeneration, Jam. 1.18.
<PB N="257" REF="002987_0262_0FE6B21507D3BD08">
<HI>Of his own will begat be us with the word of truth.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle &s;ays with re&s;pect to the Corin|thians, 1 Cor. 4.15. <HI>That he had begotten them thro' the Go&s;pel</HI>; that is, the Go&s;pel was the Means of their Regeneration &amp; Conver&s;ion.

And we are told in general by the A|po&s;tle, Rom. 10.17. <HI>That faith,</HI> or &s;aving Grace, <HI>Comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI> And now the Wi&s;dom of GOD in appointing this Word of his as the Means, or In&s;trument of Con|veying &s;aving Grace, will appear, by con&s;idering how well it is &s;uited and adapted to an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed. And now he that will but look into this perfect law of liberty, and &s;earch the Scriptures thorowly, will find they are every way accommodated to their de&s;ign, and the fitte&s;t In|&s;trument that can be, in the hand of the Spirit, to promote the Regeneration &amp; Conver&s;ion of Sinners. There is nothing nece&s;&s;ary to be known &amp; under|&s;tood by us but the Go&s;pel &s;ufficiently informs us of it. It gives us the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t di&s;cove|ries of GOD, of his Nature and Perfections, of his Works, and of his Will, that can be. It informs us of our Fall and Apo&s;tacy in our fir&s;t Parents, and of the wretched E&s;tate &amp; Condition we were brought into thereby, and the way of Man's reco|very by JESUS CHRIST. Moreover, it fully informs us of what is our duty, not only in general, but of our duty in all Ca&s;es, under all the various Stations &amp; Relations, that we &s;tand in to GOD, or to one another; for in his Word he hath &s;hewed
<PB N="258" REF="002987_0263_0FE6B2151C5A9F08">
us what is good, and all that the Lord our GOD requires of us. But then the word of GOD is not only u&s;eful in enlightning our Minds, but it is as well adapted to per&s;wade our Wills. It &s;ets before us the evil Nature of Sin, and the fatal Con&s;equences of it, &amp; &s;o affords the mo&s;t powerful Arguments to repent of all our Sins, and to turn from them. Furthermore, It &s;ets before us the fulne&s;s and &s;ufficiency there is in Chri&s;t, and his readine&s;s to receive us, and at the &s;ame time re|pre&s;ents to us our wretched and undone condition without an Intere&s;t in him: which mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t powerful arguments to encourage &amp; ex|cite us to go to him for Life, and to place all our dependence upon him. Moreover, do we need to be excited and per&s;waded unto our Duty, to love GOD, to fear Him and keep his Com|mandments? Surely there is nothing better pro|jected to an&s;wer this de&s;ign than the Go&s;pel: for it affords the mo&s;t Cogent, and moving Argu|ments herefor that can be imagined: for it not only &s;ets forth the Greatne&s;s, the Glory, and the Maje&s;ty of the LORD, to rai&s;e an holy awe with|in us towards Him, but it &s;ets forth his infinite love &amp; goodne&s;s, e&s;pecially to the Children of Men in &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing In&s;tances, as mu&s;t needs have a mo&s;t powerful tendency to inflame our hearts in love unto him. And it &s;ets forth the rea&s;ona|blene&s;s of Religion, the excellency of the divine Commands, the obligations we are under to ob|&s;erve them, the danger of di&s;obeying them, the infinite advantage, and the exceeding great Re|ward in keeping them; the &s;tronge&s;t Motives

to Obedience. Nay there are no Motives nothing to work upon our Under&s;tanding, our Will, our Affections, our Hopes, our Fears, but we may find them in the word of GOD. In &s;hort, it is profita|ble <HI>for Doctrine, for Reproof, far Correction, and for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be perfect, thorowly furni&s;hed for all good works.</HI> And it is able to <HI>make us wi&s;e unto &s;alva|tion,</HI> thro' faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And now herein appears the Wi&s;dom of GOD, that when he un|dertook to make a revelation of Him&s;elf, and of the way of Salvation, and happine&s;s, he has done it &s;o fully, as not to leave any one thing unre|vealed, that is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, or that is capable of moving, and exciting us to our duty, and &s;o to comply with the terms of life and happi|ne&s;s. The &s;ufficiency of the Scriptures for the end propo&s;ed, &s;ets forth the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein&punc;</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The publick Mini&s;try of the Word is another In&s;tituted Means of Grace, wherein much of the Wi&s;dom of GOD appears.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has not only written to us the great things of his Law, and Go&s;pel, by which we may by a diligent &s;earching of the Scriptures get ac|quainted with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, with re&s;pect both to our faith &amp; practice: but be&s;ides this, GOD has in&s;tituted the publick preaching of his Word. He has appointed pub|lick &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, and He has appointed an Order of Men, to preach the Word of GOD unto them. This was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Apo&s;tles, and for which they were &s;eparated, by that Commi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="260" REF="002987_0265_0FE6B22002F37A58">
and Command to them by our Lord, Matth. 28.19&punc; <HI>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, bapti&s;ing them,</HI> &amp;c. Or that, in Mark 16.15. <HI>Go ye into all the world and preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</HI> And this is the office and bu&s;ine&s;s of the ordinary Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; according|ly this among other things is given in &s;olemn Charge to them, <HI>Preach the word, be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, and out of &s;ea&s;on.</HI> And now that this publick preaching of the Word by an order of Men &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e, is a Means for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, is abundantly evident from the effects of it. No le&s;s than three thou&s;and were Converted by <HI>Peter's</HI> Sermon, after he had received the promi&s;e of the Father: and innume|rable are the in&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom the word preached has been quick and powerful for their Conver&s;ion, and Edification. Nay, the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our Con|ver&s;ion, or our arriving to a &s;aving Faith. Rom. 10.14, 15, 17. &mdash; <HI>How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? And how &s;hall they preach ex|cept they be &s;ent? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI> And now the Wi&s;dom of GOD in this In&s;titution will appear if we con&s;ider, either the publick preaching of the Word it &s;elf, and the particular u&s;efulne&s;s of it, or the per&s;ons that are imployed in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us con&s;ider the publick preaching of the Word it &s;elf, and what a tendency it has to pro|mote the de&s;igned End,</HI> viz. <HI>The Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners</HI>; and we &s;hall &s;ee much of the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="002987_0266_0FE6B2214A747BB0">This is the way to have the Go&s;pel &s;pread, and the knowledge of it prevail among a People, beyond what it would do, if nothing but Reading of it was injoyned. Moreover, this is the way to keep up and promote the Credit of the Go&s;pel, and of Chri&s;tianity among a People. This is the way to induce per&s;ons to the profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and to the external Practice of it at lea&s;t. Fur|thermore, by the Preaching of the Word the Doctrines, and Duties of the Go&s;pel are more fully opened, and explained, the truth and rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of them cleared up, which mu&s;t have a mighty tendency to &s;trengthen our faith in the truth of Chri&s;tianity, and to quicken and encourage us to the practice of it. And then finally, the Doctrines, &amp; Duties of the Go&s;pel being publickly preached, come with more &s;olemnity, and with greater au|thority than any other way: and for this I may appeal to the Experience of Chri&s;tians, whether the truths of the Go&s;pel delivered in a &s;erious and &s;olemn manner from the Pulpit, dont u&s;ually come with more weight &amp; authority, &amp; affect you more than the &s;ame truths received any other way: and now the publick &s;olemn preaching of the Word having a tendency thus to affect tho&s;e that &s;it under the di&s;pen&s;ation of it, &s;hows the Wi&s;dom of GOD in the In&s;titution of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If we con&s;ider Who they are that are &s;et apart for, and imployed in the Ministry of the Word, we &s;hall &s;ee more of the Divine Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>And now con&s;idering the Difficulty and Impor|tance of the work, one would ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thought at fir&s;t view, that none le&s;s than Angels world have

been imployed in it, but GOD who&s;e thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways, has committed this grand affair to <HI>Men,</HI> to <HI>frail Men,</HI> to <HI>&s;inful Men,</HI> to <HI>Men under guilt and liable to the wrath of God as well as others, to Men of the like Corruptions and pa&s;&s;ions with other men.</HI> And now the Wi&s;dom of GOD in committi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g the glorious Go&s;pel to our tru&s;t will appear, by con|&s;idering in the fir&s;t place, That this is the way to have the truths of the Go&s;pel delivered to us in a <HI>more ea&s;y, familiar, and le&s;s terrible manner than could be any other way.</HI> If GOD &s;hould &s;peak immediately from Heaven, or &s;end his Go&s;pel to us by the Mini&s;try of Angels, as he did the Law to the Children of I&s;rael, we &s;hould all be ready to &s;ay, as they did to Mo&s;es, <HI>Speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God &s;peak with us, le&s;t we die,</HI> Exod. 20.19. GOD has therefore con&s;ide|red our frame, and has committed the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try to &s;ome of our &s;elves, to Men <HI>formed out of the clay,</HI> as we are, <HI>who&s;e terror &s;hall not make us afraid,</HI> but with whom we may conver&s;e with freedom, and altho' we are to &s;it under their Mi|ni&s;try with reverence, con&s;idering them as the Me&s;&s;engers of the LORD of Ho&s;ts, yet there is nothing to terrify or affrighten us.</P>
<P>Again, This trea&s;ure of the Go&s;pel being com|mitted to Earthen ve&s;&s;els, to weak frail Men, &s;erves <HI>to &s;et forth, and make the power of GOD more Con&s;picuous,</HI> when it proves Effectual for the Conver&s;ion of Sinners.</P>
<P>The Strength of GOD is made perfect in our weakne&s;s. And hence &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. 4.7.
<PB N="263" REF="002987_0268_0FE6B22E1E1DD2D8">
<HI>We have this trea&s;ure in Earthen ve&s;&s;els, that the excellency of the power may be of God &amp; not of us.</HI></P>
<P>But then again, The Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel being committed to Men <HI>that can preach more experimentally to others than could be by any other Creatures,</HI> this mu&s;t needs be a great advan|tage to their Mini&s;try, and &s;o di&s;cover the Wi&s;|dom of GOD in appointing them.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters being of the &s;ame frame and con|&s;titution, and under the &s;ame common circum|&s;tances with other Men; they feel the &s;ame workings of Corruption, and the &s;ame workings of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit of GOD within them, they meet with the &s;ame &s;nares, and are in all things tempted as other Men, have the &s;ame failings, infirmities and imperfections, and are to have the &s;ame work of Grace wrought upon them, and &s;o are brought into a Converted, and &s;aving State, after the &s;ame manner that other Men are. And now this mu&s;t needs give great ad|vantage to their Preaching, and wonderfully enable them to adapt and accommodate their di&s;cour&s;es to the circum&s;tances of their hearers. For if a Mini&s;ter does, and every good Mini&s;ter will, frame his di&s;cour&s;es very much from his own Experience, he will be &s;ure of &s;uiting the Ca&s;es of many others; for Mini&s;ters and People have the &s;ame Corruptions, and meet with the &s;ame Temptations, and doubtle&s;s, do very often feel the very &s;ame workings of their Spirits within them. And upon this account, I think I may venture to &s;ay, That a good Experienced Chri&s;tian endowed with the ordinary Mini&s;terial
<PB N="264" REF="002987_0269_0FE6B22E3234D438">
gifts, is better qualified for a Preacher to &s;in|ful Men, than an Angel from Heaven: for al|tho' we mu&s;t allow them to be Creatures of much greater Sagacity and wi&s;dom than Men, yet they have never experienced the workings of a corrupt Nature wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hin&punc; they never knew what it was to endure the Divine De&s;ertion, or to have the light of GOD's Countenance hid from them, they never knew what it is to be under Afflicti|ons, and &s;o never experienced the workings of their Spirits&punc; under &s;uch Circum&s;tances: and therefore cant be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak &s;o feelingly and experimentally, if &s;o intelligently, about tho&s;e things as an Experienced Mini&s;ter, who has felt all the&s;e things in his own Soul.</P>
<P>Once more, Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel (if they are as they ought to be) have this advantage, to <HI>give a Specimen or Example if that Religion they recommend to others, in their own lives.</HI></P>
<P>And now their Example is advantagious upon two accounts Namely, that it gives Credit to Religion, by a&s;&s;uring their Hearers that they believe what they teach them, and are under the Influence of tho&s;e Doctrines and Pre|cepts they recommend to them. And then Se|condly, it &s;hews them that the Religion taught them is practicable, becau&s;e they &s;ee &s;uch as are under the &s;ame Corruption, and expo&s;ed to the &s;ame Temptations, in the practice of it. And this advantage we &s;hould lo&s;e if we had Prea|chers &s;ent immediately from Heaven unto us. For an Angel from Heaven altho' he be perfectly pure and holy, yet his Example would not be &s;o Influential on Mankind as one from among
<PB N="265" REF="002987_0270_0FE6B230823F0ED8">
our &s;elves. For if one of tho&s;e pure &amp; &s;potle&s;s Spirits &s;hould de&s;cend, and preach up a holy life, and urge it among other things from his own Example, the argument would not be &s;o likely to affect us: We &s;hould be ready to think that the holine&s;s he recommends may do for the An|gelick order, for tho&s;e that have no principles of Corruption, and are perfected in holine&s;s; but we &s;hould &s;ee &s;o much Sin &amp; Corruption in our &s;elves, as that we &s;hould be di&s;couraged from at|tempting the Imitation of &s;uch pure &amp; holy ones.</P>
<P>But then, as the Wi&s;dom of GOD appears in appointing Men, and not any other Creature, to Preach the Word, &s;o does it al&s;o appear in ap|pointing, and fixing upon a certain order of Men for that purpo&s;e, whom he rai&s;es up and quali|fies for it. Are all Prophets? Are all Apo&s;tles? are all Teachers? No, for all are not called, to it, nor qualified for it. And none may take this Office upon them but they that are called of GOD unto it. And now the Wi&s;dom of GOD in this is very manife&s;t: for it is very nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e who undertake to teach the great Doctrines, and Duties of the Go&s;pel, &s;hould give them&s;elves wholly to the Study of them. So every Man could not attend upon it, becau&s;e there are other affairs that mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be carried on. And therefore GOD in his Wi&s;e &amp; &s;overeign Providence &s;o over-rules the hearts, and di&s;po&s;itions of Men, as to incline &s;ome to one Calling, and &s;ome to another, for the good order, and comfortable carrying on of the affairs of the World. And &s;ome he inclines and di&s;po&s;es to be Studying, &amp; thereby accompli&s;hing them|&s;elves,

and then puts them into the Mini&s;try: And having ordained that they who Preach the Go&s;pel &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel; and that they who are taught in the Word &s;hould Communicate to him that teacheth in all good things: He has hereby made provi&s;ion for the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, that they &s;hould give them&s;elves wholly to the Study, &amp; Mini&s;try of the Word. And &s;urely in this way GOD has wi&s;ely contrived for the good of his Church. For in this way provi&s;ion is made for the Churches of Chri&s;t to be furni&s;h|ed with burning and &s;hining lights, with faith|ful Pa&s;tors, able Mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;ta|ment, that &s;hall feed the People with knowledge, and under&s;tanding.

And our Saviour has told us, what would be the &s;ad Effect of that: Namely, <HI>That if the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch,</HI> Mat. 15.14.</P>
<P>And thus much for the Wi&s;dom of GOD in In&s;tituting a publick Mini&s;try of the Word in order to the Conver&s;ion of Sinners. I may not proceed at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider the other In&s;ti|tuted Means of Grace, but &s;hall Conclude with a word or two by way of APPLICATION.</P>

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s you are de&s;igned for, is of the greate&s;t Importance of any in the World.

<P N="4">4. This might be Improved by Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, <HI>to Encourage them in, and prompt them to the faithful di&s;charge of their Office.</HI></P>
<P>For con&s;idering the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try is of Divine In&s;titution, when any are called of GOD to that Office, they may depend upon his pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing to accompany his own Ordinance; nay, it is no more than Chri&s;t has a&s;&s;ured them of, when he told his Apo&s;tles, <HI>That he would be with them always to the End of the World,</HI> Mat. 28.20. But then the con&s;ideration, that the de&s;ign of their Office and Mini&s;try is to Convert Sinners, and Edify Saints, &s;hould put them upon doing their u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mo&s;t, that the End of their Office may be an|&s;wered. Here I might &s;ay, that Mini&s;ters ought to undertake the Mini&s;try of the Word not for any carnal, worldly &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns, but to an&s;wer the End of their In&s;titution, which is the Conver|&s;ion of Sinners, and having engaged in this Ser|vice, they &s;hould give them&s;elves wholly to it; they mu&s;t be diligent in their Studies, earne&s;t and

<P>But to conclude at pre&s;ent,</P>
<P>Let us look upon our &s;elves to be advantaged above the greate&s;t part of the World much every way, <HI>but chiefly for that unto us are committed the Oracles of GOD.</HI> And now as we would adore the Wi&s;dom of GOD in writing the great things of his Law and Go&s;pel unto us, and in &s;ending forth his Emba&s;&s;adors to Preach the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and &s;hew Men the way to Salvation; &s;o let us adore the &s;overeign Goodne&s;s &amp; Grace of GOD to us, that the lines are fallen to us in &s;o plea&s;ant a place, and that he has given us &s;o goodly an heritage; that he has given us his Word to be a lamp to our feet, and as a light unto our paths, and his Mini&s;ters to guide our feet in the way of peace; verily he hath not dealt &s;o with many other Nations: for as for his Statutes, and his Judgments they have not known them. And now &s;ince we Enjoy &s;uch precious Means of Grace, let us con&s;i|der what is expected from us, &amp; what will become

of us, if we &s;hould neglect to improve the price that is put into our hands to get Wi&s;dom and Grace. Let us con&s;ider that our being lifted up to Heaven with Privileges, will be only the means of aggravating our Guilt, and &s;o of &s;inking us the deeper into the bottomle&s;s Pit, if we don't Im|prove them aright. Let us take the Apo&s;tle's Advice &amp; con&s;ider the Argument with which he inforces it, Heb. 2. beg. <HI>Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t heed to the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let them &s;lip: for if the word &s;poken by Angels was &s;ted|fa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion &amp; di&s;obedience recei|ved a ju&s;t recompence of reward, How &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great Salvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was Confirmed to us by tho&s;e that heard him!</HI></P>
<P>Let us then take heed le&s;t we receive the Grace of GOD in vain; but let us do our ut|mo&s;t that the Word and the Mini&s;try of it which we have &s;et under all our Days, may an&s;wer the Ends of their In&s;titution upon us, and if once we come to be Converted and brought into a State of Grace by the Word and the Preaching of it, then we &s;hall ri&s;e in our E&s;teem of it and of tho&s;e that di&s;pen&s;e it unto us.

<P>So then,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>PRAYER is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, wherein we may &s;ee the Wi&s;dom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>As for Prayer I can't pretend to de&s;cribe it better than I have it done to my hands, in that Excellent Catechi&s;m we have in common U&s;e among us. Namely,</P>
<P>That <Q>It is an Offering up of our De&s;ires to GOD for things agreable to his Will in the Name of CHRIST, with Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins, and thankful Acknowledgment of his Mercies.</Q></P>
<P>And now that Prayer is In&s;tituted &amp; appoint|ed by GOD, appears from the whole current of Scripture, where this is con&s;idered as an Act of religious Wor&s;hip due to GOD, and what he expects &amp; requires at our hands, and is angry with tho&s;e that re&s;train Prayer before him; yea and threatens to pour out his Fury upon them that Call not upon his Name; and where he al&s;o declares him&s;elf delighted with, and glo|rified by the Prayers and Prai&s;es of the Upright. But then be&s;ides &s;uch plain Intimations of the Duty of Prayer, we find it expre&s;ly required and demanded of us, Eph. 6.18. <HI>Praying always with all Prayer, and Supplication in the Spirit.</HI> 1 The&s;. 5.17. <HI>Pray without Cea&s;ing.</HI> 1 Tim. 2.8. <HI>I will that Men Pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath &amp; doubting.</HI> And now that this Duty of Prayer is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, or that in the way of this Duty we are
<PB N="276" REF="002987_0281_0FE6B2557618B970">
to obtain the regenerating and &s;aving Grace of GOD, is evident from the encouraging Promi&s;es to &s;uch as attend this Duty in a right manner. For thus &s;ays our Saviour, Matth 7.7, 8. <HI>Ask and it &s;hall be given you: Seek and ye &s;hall find: Knock and it &s;hall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that &s;eeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it &s;hall be opened.</HI> So Joh. 16.23. <HI>Verily, Verily I &s;ay unto you, what&s;oever ye &s;hall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</HI> But then the holy Spirit in a particular manner, (by which alone regenera|ting and &s;anctifying Grace is wrought in the Soul,) is to be obtained in the way of Prayer, Luk. 11.13. <HI>If ye then being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> Accordingly the Apo&s;tle Encoura|ges us to <HI>Come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need,</HI> Heb. 4.16. And now Prayer is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our receiving, that there is no ob|taining without it. <HI>Ye have not, becau&s;e ye ask not,</HI> James 5.2.</P>
<P>And now GOD's obliging us to give our &s;elves unto Prayer, in order to our obtaining the regene|ting Grace of GOD and to have it carried on in Sanctification, is an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, becau&s;e nothing is more proper in general than that Divine Grace &s;hould be &s;ought for in order to its being obtained. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THIS is the way to have the Fountain of all Grace &s;uitably honoured, and acknowledged by us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="002987_0282_0FE6B25702355690">By our applying our &s;elves to GOD in a way of Prayer for renewing &amp; &s;anctifying Grace, we profe&s;s and acknowledge him to be not only the Father of all Mercies; but the GOD of all Grace: and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is acknowledged as the meritorious Cau&s;e of all. Our going to GOD in a way of Prayer for his Grace, plainly implies our belief that he has it to be&s;tow, and our Coming in the Name of Chri&s;t, is a practical Acknowlegment that he has purcha&s;ed this Grace for us, and that it is only thro' him that it may be obtained. And accordingly if we obtain the Grace of GOD upon our &s;eeking to him for it in a way of Prayer, we &s;hall be the more natu|rally led to give him the Glory of it. When Con|verting Grace or &s;anctifying Grace comes as the An&s;wer of our Prayers, we &s;hall plainly &s;ee, and &s;o &s;hall readily acknowledge, that it is not of our &s;elves, but the gift of GOD. And now &s;ince all Grace is derived from GOD thro' Chri&s;t, there is all the rea&s;on in the world that he &s;hould have the glory of it, and therefore it is wi&s;ely &amp; prudently Contrived when he in&s;i&s;ts upon being &s;ought unto, and inquired of to do it for us.</P>

<P>It is very proper and nece&s;&s;ary that every one in order to his obtaining the &s;pecial and &s;aving Grace of GOD, &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible that by Nature he is entirely de&s;titute of it, that <HI>in

<P N="3">3. <HI>Prayer is a Means of Grace very proper and &s;uitable, as it &s;erves to di&s;po&s;e and prepare our Hearts to receive the Divine Grace, and to put the &s;ame into Exerci&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Prayer has a tendency to open the Heart, to &s;often it, and thereby fit it to receive the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of divine Grace: the making it our con&s;tant Practice to &s;eek to GOD for his Grace to Renew &amp; Sanctify us, leads us to think of the Excellency and the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, and this will have a tendency to excite our De&s;ires after it: and tho&s;e De&s;ires if we &s;hould not &s;uppo&s;e them to be Grace, yet they open and prepare the Heart to receive it, and will put us upon u&s;ing our Endeavours, in a diligent and careful Attendance upon the Means of Grace in order to our obtaining it, until at length we find &amp; feel the Grace of GOD working within us. This we may doubtle&s;s have Experienced, that by Exerci&s;ing our &s;elves in the Duty of

Prayer holy &amp; gracious De&s;ires have been ex|cited within us, which have grown to holy Purpo&s;es and Re&s;olutions, till indeed the Habits of Grace have been rooted in our Souls. He that Prays with that earne&s;tne&s;s &amp; fervency that he ought, will find that the very Praying for any Grace in particular, is very helpful to the Exerci&s;e of it. Thus for In&s;tance does a Man Pray that he may Love GOD, he will find that his very Praying for this, and the Arguments that occur to his own Mind, and which he pleads with GOD for it, will help very much to put him in the Exerci&s;e of Love unto him. The very Praying that he may Love the Lord his GOD with all his Heart, will very much help to inlarge his Heart in Love unto him, he will find his Affections &s;tir|red, and inflamed by the very Petition. And thus we &s;hall find it with re&s;pect to any par|ticular Grace we Pray for, or any particular Sin &amp; Lu&s;t that we Pray again&s;t. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to the other Parts of Prayer. Such as Confe&s;&s;ion of Sins, which &s;erves to bring our Sins to our Remem|brance, and &s;o to prepare and di&s;po&s;e our Hearts to Repentance for them, and watchfulne&s;s a|gain&s;t them. So again the Calling to Mind GOD's Mercies, helps to enlarge our Hearts in Love &amp; thankfulne&s;s to him. And then la&s;tly, our Interce&s;&s;ions for others, helps to excite our Charity towards them we Pray for. So that Prayer, if it be duly &amp; carefully attended, has a natural tendency, aptitude and fitne&s;s to con|vey

&s;aving Grace into the Soul, or to put it into Exerci&s;e, which &s;hews &s;omething of the Wi&s;|dom of GOD in obliging us to give our &s;elves unto Prayer in order to our obtaining the rege|nerating Grace of GOD, and to continue there|in in order to our growth in Grace, and our advancement to further degrees of Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>SINGING of P&s;alms, Hymns &amp; &s;piritual Songs is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, very proper and &s;uitable for the End,</HI> and &s;o di&s;covers the Wi&s;|dom of GOD therein.</P>
<P>Under the Law, not only Vocal, but In&s;tru|mental Mu&s;ick was directed to in the Wor&s;hip of GOD.

Thus we find in the New Te&s;tament expre&s;s Precepts and Coun&s;els for Singing P&s;alms to GOD, and particular Directions how, and when it is to be performed by us. Thus, Eph. 5.19. <HI>Speaking to your &s;elves in P&s;alms, Hymns, and &s;piritual Songs, Singing &amp; making Melody in your Hearts to the Lord.</HI> So, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16. almo&s;t the &s;ame

And the Apo&s;tle directs us as to the manner of it, when he tells us what his own Re&s;olution was, namely, that he would <HI>Sing with the Spirit, and with the Understanding,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.15. Furthermore, We have &s;ome general Direction as to Times &amp; Sea&s;ons for this Duty in <HI>James</HI> 5.13.

<P N="5">5. <HI>The</HI> SABBATH, <HI>or the &s;etting apart one Day in &s;even from worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, for the imme|ate Wor&s;hip &amp; Service of GOD,</HI> is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, wherein much of the Wi&s;dom of GOD appears.</P>
<P>This GOD ordained from the beginning, that one Day in &s;even &s;hould be &s;eparated and de|voted to his immediate Service. GOD fini&s;hed his Work of Creation in Six Days, and he re&s;ted the &s;eventh Day, and GOD ble&s;&s;ed it, and &s;anctifyed it for him&s;elf. Gen. 2.3. <HI>And God ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh Day, and &s;anctified it, becau&s;e that he had rested from all his work which he had created and made</HI> So early as this was the In|&s;titution of the Sabbath; and GOD renewed the In&s;titution of it, when he made it one of tho&s;e Ten Words or Commandments which he delivered in &s;uch an awful &amp; glorious manner upon Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> Exod. 20.8. <HI>Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy: Six Days &s;halt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the &s;eventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou &s;halt do no manner of Work,</HI> &amp;c. And as this Com|mand is founded upon a particular Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> GOD's working Six Days in the Creation of the World, and then Re&s;ting the Seventh Day and Ble&s;&s;ing it; &s;o this is a rea&s;on that holds for one as well as for another; for Chri|&s;tians as well as Jews: and upon that account we are all as much obliged to keep a Sabbath as they; that is, one Day in &s;even: if not the
<PB N="284" REF="002987_0289_0FE6B26AAF4D8710">
particular Day; for &s;o far it is a moral Precept founded on rea&s;ons perpetually &amp; univer&s;ally obliging. But then as to the particular Day of the &s;even, That is but a po&s;itive In&s;titution; and for particular Rea&s;ons may be changed. Accordingly ever &s;ince the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead, which was on the Fir&s;t Day of the Week, that Day is fixed upon for the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, as the &s;eventh Day of the Week was for the Jewi&s;h Sabbath. And this is a Day wherein we are to &s;eparate our &s;elves from the World, the Cares and the Bu|&s;ine&s;s of it, except what is of Nece&s;&s;ity &amp; Mer|cy; and Imploy the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Time in publick and private Duties of Religion. And now GOD's appointing one Day in &s;even to be &s;epara|ted from the World to the Duties of Religion, is a Means of Grace wherein much of the Wi&s;|dom of GOD appears, becau&s;e it <HI>has &s;uch a happy tendency to promote the work of Conver&s;ion and Sanctification within us.</HI> For he that con&s;iders any thing will be &s;en&s;ible that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us in order to our Conver&s;ion, and the progre&s;s of Grace in Sanctification, that our Minds &s;hould at &s;ome particular Times be ta|ken off from the World, the Bu&s;ine&s;s &amp; Cares of it, and fixed upon the things that are Divine, that are heavenly and of a &s;piritual Nature. We mu&s;t have time to think not only of pro|viding for our Bodies; but al&s;o to think how to &s;ecure the Salvation of our Souls. And we all know too well by Experience that when we are engaged in worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, we can't
<PB N="285" REF="002987_0290_0FE648B2DE55B770">
attend the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion and of our Souls to any purpo&s;e: We find that when our Hands are engaged in worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, our Heads and our Hearts will be very much taken up about the &s;ame, in&s;omuch that whatever thoughts of GOD or of Religion ari&s;e in our Minds at &s;uch a Time, they are very di&s;tracted, broken &amp; in|terrupted, &s;eldom or never ripen &s;o as to produce any good Purpo&s;es, much le&s;s to produce any good Practices. So that we our &s;elves, if we were re|&s;olved upon working out the Salvation of our Souls, &s;hould think it highly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et &s;ome time apart from our &s;ecular Affairs to attend that Bu&s;ine&s;s. And becau&s;e we &s;hould find our &s;elves very apt, from the hurries of worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, to po&s;tpone, and put off the time with the hopes of being more at lei&s;ure, and having a more conve|nient Opportunity for it; and when that time we allotted upon comes, &s;hall find &s;omething el&s;e to interrupt &amp; hinder us: I &s;ay we &s;hould find our &s;elves &s;o apt to defer &amp; put off the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, that our own Rea&s;on would tell us, that if ever we intended to pur&s;ue the Work of Con|ver&s;ion &amp; Salvation to any purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t not leave the Times for the Exerci&s;es of Religion va|riable, and at uncertainties; but mu&s;t &s;ix upon &s;ome certain, &s;tated Times, wherein to attend that Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not &s;uffer our &s;elves (unle&s;s upon &s;ome extraordinary Occa&s;ions) to be diverted or hindred from it. Our own rea&s;on upon a little Experience of our &s;elves would &s;ugge&s;t this to be very nece&s;&s;ary Accordingly this is a Ca&s;e that GOD has wi&s;ely con&s;idered, and has &s;tated
<PB N="286" REF="002987_0291_0FE6B26CE6164A38">
and fixed &s;ome certain Times for his more im|mediate Service, &amp; attendance upon religious Duties. He has not left it variable &amp; uncertain, for every one to appoint a time for them&s;elves as it would &s;uit their particular Occa&s;ions; &s;ome one Day, and &s;ome another; but he has fixed a certain Time, a particular Day for all to Imploy in &s;piritual Exerci&s;es, which every one knowing may order their Affairs accordingly. And as there was Wi&s;dom in having the Time fixed and &s;tated, &s;o the proportion of time &s;et apart for re|ligious Exerci&s;es is a further In&s;tance of Divine Prudence; <HI>namely, A Seventh part of Time.</HI> GOD in appointing but one Day in Seven, has graciou&s;ly accommodated him&s;elf to the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Men: for the Sabbaths are not &s;o frequent, nor do they take up &s;o much of our Time, but that every Man may ea&s;ily &s;pare &s;uch a proportion from his Secular Occa&s;ions to attend the Service of GOD, and of his Soul; and it leaves Men utrerly inexcu&s;able, that look upon the Sabbath as a burden, and neglect to &s;anctify it as they ought, by re&s;ting from all worldly Im|ployments &amp; Recreations. For when GOD who is the Lord of our Time, and has a right to us, and to all our Service, allows &s;ix Days for our own Imployment, it mu&s;t needs be very ba&s;e &amp; un|grateful to deny him the religious Services of the Seventh. But then on the other hand it was Wi&s;dom in GOD not to &s;et the Sabbaths at a greater di&s;tance from each other. For he knew what Carnal and Earthly Hearts we have with|in us, and how apt we are while imployed in
<PB N="287" REF="002987_0292_0FE6B276DB2E7730">
worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s to have our Affections ingro&s;&s;ed thereby, and that if the Revolutions of the Sab|bath were more &s;eldom, wherein we were to be called off from worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s &amp; worldly Cares, we &s;hould quickly &s;ink into &s;uch a worldly Frame of Spirit, that we &s;hould not without the utmo&s;t difficulty be recovered out of it. We all find by Experience that while we are pur&s;uing our world|ly Bu&s;ine&s;s, the World and the things of it &s;teal our Affections, and we grow &s;o cold, carele&s;s and unconcern'd about Religion and the grand Affairs of our Souls, that we need to be taken off from our worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t once a Week to en|gage in religious Exerci&s;es in a &s;et &amp; &s;olemn man|ner, to prevent our Souls cleaving unto the du&s;t, and to elevate and rai&s;e them up to the Contem|plation of, and delight in things more noble and truly Excellent.</P>
<P>Furthermore, The Sabbaths ought to be &s;o near together as that with proper and &s;uitable Care the Word we Read or Hear, and the Ordinances we attend, may in &s;ome good mea&s;ure be retained by us for our u&s;e until the return of another, which we could not &s;uppo&s;e if there was a much grea|ter di&s;tance between them. In &s;hort, A Sabbath &s;eems to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the begetting, &s;upporting &amp; advancing Religion among a Peo|ple; it &s;eems as if not only the Life &amp; Power, but the very form &amp; &s;hew of Religion would ut|terly fail, if the Keeping of a Sabbath Day &s;hould be laid a&s;ide: and therefore it mu&s;t needs be an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom, as well as Goodne&s;s in GOD to appoint a Sabbath, and at &s;uch di&s;tance as
<PB N="288" REF="002987_0293_0FE6B276EE4801D8">
that every Man may ea&s;ily &s;pare the time from his outward Affairs to attend upon them, and yet &s;o near together, as that the good Impre&s;&s;ions that are made upon our Mind on one, may with Care remain till the return of another.</P>
<P>I might go on, and &s;how the Wi&s;dom of GOD in In&s;tituting &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies for publick Wor|&s;hip, together with the Sacraments of the New Te&s;tament, from the &s;uitablene&s;s of them to an|&s;wer their Intention: But I mu&s;t leave the Con|&s;ideration of them at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e I think what has been already &s;aid ought not to pa&s;s without &s;ome particular</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>So then in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What we have heard concerning the Duty of Prayer, and of it's being a Means of Grace, teaches us, That if ever we would obtain the Converting and Saving Grace of GOD, we mu&s;t</HI> give our &s;elves unto Prayer.</P>
<P>Since GOD has appointed it as a Means by which he will convey his Grace &amp; Spirit to us, there is all the rea&s;on in the world that it &s;hould be attended by us. Since Converting Grace is to be obtained in the way of Prayer, and it can't be expected without it, &s;urely we &s;hould <HI>Pray with|out Cea&s;ing,</HI> and &s;hould <HI>Pray always with all Prayer,</HI> even with all Kinds of Prayer, <HI>viz.</HI> Pub|lick, and Private or Family, and Secret or Clo|&s;et Prayer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We &s;hould attend upon</HI> Publick <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Prayer is a part of that publick Wor&s;hip that is to be paid to GOD in his Hou&s;e; hence his
<PB N="289" REF="002987_0294_0FE6B2780BFD36C0">
Hou&s;e is called an <HI>Hou&s;e of Prayer,</HI> I&s;a. 56.7. We mu&s;t therefore go into GOD's Tabernacle and wor&s;hip at his Foot&s;tool: we mu&s;t joyn the A&s;|&s;emblies of GOD's People, in offering up our united Prayers &amp; Supplications to the GOD of all Grace, for the be&s;towing his Grace &amp; Spirit upon us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We mu&s;t attend</HI> Family-<HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;ee to it that our Families be &s;uch as <HI>Call upon the Name of the Lord</HI>: Our Hou&s;es mu&s;t be Hou&s;es of Prayer: Our Families little A&s;&s;em|blies for Divine Wor&s;hip; with whom we are to Implore the divine Grace &amp; Spirit to be afforded to us, and to our Children &amp; Servants, that we and they may be renewed by divine Grace, and &s;o made the Children and Servants of GOD by Regeneration.</P>
<P N="3">3. But then be&s;ides this, <HI>There is</HI> Clo&s;et <HI>or</HI> Secret <HI>Prayer to be attended by us.</HI></P>
<P>When we pray we mu&s;t <HI>enter into our Clo&s;et, and when we have &s;hut the Door, mu&s;t pray to our Father that is in Secret, and our Father that &s;ets in Secret &s;hall reward us openly</HI>; as our Saviour him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.6.</P>
<P>And now, If we would <HI>obtain Mercy &amp; find Grace to help in time of need</HI>; we mu&s;t be fre|quent in our Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace: No Day &s;hould pa&s;s without our fervent Suppli|cations to Heaven both in the Morning and the Evening of it. Nay the Practice of the devout P&s;almi&s;t is very commendable, and &s;hould be Imitated by tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s will allow of it: who &s;ays, P&s;al. 55.17. <HI>Evening &amp; Morning,
<PB N="290" REF="002987_0295_0FE6B27820DB31A0">
and at Noon will I Pray &amp; Cry aloud, and he &s;hall hear my Voice.</HI> So is that of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding the Decree that was made again&s;t it, and the Danger he knew he run by it, of being Ca&s;t into the Den of Lions, yet Kneeled three times a Day and prayed &amp; gave Thanks, as he did aforetime, <HI>Dan.</HI> 6.10, 11. Nay in &s;hort, We ought always to be in a praying Frame, and ought much more frequently than this to be offering up our pious Ejaculations to GOD, even upon every Occa&s;ion, be&s;ides the more &s;tated Times of &s;olemn Prayer.</P>
<P>And now to move &amp; per&s;wade to the Practice of this Duty of Prayer, meerly from the Con|&s;ideration, that it is a Means of Converting &s;aving Grace unto us, let us con&s;ider two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The</HI> Excellency <HI>and the</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity <HI>of Con|verting Grace.</HI></P>
<P>It is the one thing needful, and comprehends all other Ble&s;&s;ings. This is the Re&s;toration of the Divine Image, and what renders us the Ob|jects of GOD's Delight &amp; Complacence, and fits us for the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t intimate Commu|nion with him, and for the full &amp; everla&s;ting Enjoyment of him. Now &s;urely this is worth our &s;eeking &amp; asking for. This is the Wi&s;dom, the Merchandize of which is better than the Mer|chandize of Silver, and the gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more precious than Rubies, and all the things we can de&s;ire are not to be compared with her: She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that re|taineth her. Surely then we ought to Cry after this
<PB N="291" REF="002987_0296_0FE6B27EE8AA3B88">
Wi&s;dom, and lift up our voice for Under&s;tanding: we &s;hould &s;eek for her as for Silver, and &s;earch for her as for hid Trea&s;ure. For it is infinitely Worth our taking &s;uch Pains to obtain.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider <HI>How</HI> rea&s;onable <HI>a thing it is that we &s;hould apply our &s;elves to GOD in a way of Prayer for his Grace.</HI></P>
<P>We could not de&s;ire nor expect to obtain this Grace upon more ea&s;y terms than asking for it. There are none of us can think it rea&s;onable or proper that GOD &s;hould be&s;tow his Grace upon us without a &s;uitable Acknowledgment of him by humble Addre&s;&s;es &amp; Applications to him. There is nothing more ju&s;t &amp; rea&s;onable than that GOD &s;hould be &s;ought unto and <HI>Inquired of to do it for us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider <HI>How</HI> Inexcu&s;able <HI>we &s;hall be, if we remain in our Unconverted State, thro' our Neglect of Prayer to GOD for his Grace to Change us.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared this is the Ca&s;e of many, that they remain in a gracele&s;s, unconverted State, becau&s;e they have not &s;ought to GOD by Prayer for his Grace: They wickedly &amp; wilfully re|&s;train Prayer before GOD, they will rather go without the Grace of GOD than ask him for it. Or if they are not &s;o &s;tubborn &amp; wilful as to re|fu&s;e to pray, yet thro' a &s;inful Carele&s;ne&s;s &amp; In|con&s;ideratene&s;s they neglect it one time after another. Or if they &s;hould &s;ometimes attend the outward part of the Duty yet it is only for Fa&s;hi|ons &s;ake, and to &s;ave their Credit &amp; Reputation among Men; or to quiet &amp; &s;till their own Con|&s;ciences,
<PB N="292" REF="002987_0297_0FE6B27F00B47738">
without any proper de&s;ires of the Grace of GOD: For tho' they wor&s;hip him with their Mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hs &amp; honour him with their Lips, their Hearts are far from him. And now as &s;uch Men &s;hall not receive any thing from the Lord, but will remain in their gracele&s;s State: &s;o they will be utterly Inexcu&s;able, they will have no &s;uffi|cient Plea for their remaining in a State of Na|ture and going on in a &s;inful Cour&s;e. It wont be enough for them to &s;ay they could not Con|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt or Change their own Hearts; becau&s;e if they would have &s;ought to GOD aright for his Grace, they might have obtained it; for our Saviour has a&s;&s;ured us, That <HI>our heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him,</HI> Luk 11.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What we have heard of &s;inging P&s;alms and Spiritual Songs, as an In&s;tituted Means of Grace, aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds Matter of Reproof to &s;uch who Undervalue &amp; Neglect this Duty.</HI></P>

that the Wi&s;dom of GOD very clearly &s;hines in In&s;tituting &amp; Appointing them.</P>
<P>I now go on to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Solemn</HI> A&s;&s;emblies <HI>for Publick Wor&s;hip, is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace &s;o well adapted to an&s;wer the End, that the Wi&s;dom of GOD very vi&s;ibly appears therein.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD has appointed &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies, holy Convocations for the wor&s;hipping him in a publick manner is very evident from his Word; where the thing is not only plainly &amp; nece&s;&s;arily implyed, but fully expre&s;&s;ed. Thus if we look back into the Jewi&s;h State, we &s;hall find that pub|lick Wor&s;hip, even the Wor&s;hipping GOD in &s;o|lemn A&s;&s;emblies was In&s;tituted for them. Nay (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Sherlock.</NOTE> ob&s;erves) <Q>The whole of that Wor|&s;hip commanded by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;eems to be of a publick Nature, and to be performed in a pub|lick manner. Publick Places were appointed for the Wor&s;hip of GOD, &s;uch as the Taber|cle fir&s;t of all, and the Temple, where all the Sacrifices were brought to be offered by the Prie&s;ts, who were publick Per&s;ons. More|over, there were publick Times of Wor&s;hip In&s;tituted by GOD for that Nation, &s;uch as the &s;eventh day Sabbath, the new Moons and annual Fe&s;tivals, when all their Males were to appear three times in a Year before the Lord, which are called <HI>holy Convocations,</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;emblings together.</HI></Q> Lev. 23. And they are called <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> &amp; <HI>&s;olemn Meetings,</HI> I&s;a. 1.13.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="002987_0302_0FE6B36202BD9D48">And as there were &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies for pub|lick Wor&s;hip under the Law, &s;o are there under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, and it is a Duty plainly and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed all along throughout the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>This is contained &amp; implyed in the very Name of a <HI>Church,</HI> that is given to Chri&s;tians; for (as the forementioned Author ob&s;erves) <Q>the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> properly &s;ignifys a Meeting and A&s;&s;embly which is called together; hence he defines a Chri&s;tian Church to be a <HI>Society of Men united, and combined together in the faith and wor&s;hip of Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> It is a Society that agree to wor&s;hip GOD &amp; CHRIST, or GOD thro' CHRIST, in a united, that is a publick manner.</P>
<P>Furthermore, &s;ome of the Ordinances of Chri&s;t were &s;uch as was requi&s;ite they &s;hould be at|tended by the Meeting of Chri&s;tians together in one Place, and &s;o in a publick manner. As par|ticularly that of the Lord's Supper. Accordingly we read of their <HI>coming together in the Church,</HI> and their <HI>coming together into one place,</HI> to eat the Lord's Supper, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.18, 20.</P>
<P>But yet to &s;ay no more on this head, the A|po&s;tle to the Hebrews, Chap. 10.25. Expre&s;sly cautions and forbids, <HI>The for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome was.</HI> Now this prohibition nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es a po&s;i|tive Precept to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together; and that a&s;&s;embling together could be for nothing el&s;e than for the publick wor&s;hip of GOD in the ways of his appointment: their Meeting toge|ther was to offer up their united prayers &amp; prai&s;es,
<PB N="298" REF="002987_0303_0FE6B362188A41D0">
to hear the word of the Lord di&s;pen&s;ed by his Emba&s;&s;adors, to attend upon the Sacraments, to receive the Ble&s;&s;ing that GOD commands in his Hou&s;e, and the like.</P>
<P>And now GOD's appointing and ordaining Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies, wherein we may in a pub|lick united manner pay our religious wor&s;hip to him, is of &s;uch a nature and tendency, both for the honour of GOD, and for the bringing for|ward their own Conver&s;ion, and promoting their Sanctification, that a great deal of the Wi&s;dom of GOD appears therein. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hereby GOD has a great deal of Honour done him which is due unto his Name.</HI></P>
<P>Every one that con&s;iders who GOD is, and the relation he &s;tands in to any of his Creatures, will be &s;en&s;ible that all the honour that can po&s;&s;ibly be paid him by any of them, is due unto him: and it is certainly the Wi&s;dom of GOD to get all that honour &amp; glory from them that they are capable of rendring to him, becau&s;e it is the high|e&s;t end he can propo&s;e. And now as every pri|vate act of religious Wor&s;hip is a doing honour to GOD, much more is He honoured by the pub|lick acknowledgments, and adorations that are paid unto him. When a People meet together in a &s;olemn manner, and offer up their united Prayers and Prai&s;es to Him, it is &s;uch an open, publick acknowledgment of his Infinite Being and Perfections, and of all his wondrous Works, that it &s;erves very much to magnify and honour him in the face of the World; and yet it is but an honour that is ju&s;tly due unto him. For he is
<PB N="299" REF="002987_0304_0FE6B36A87F840B0">
our common Father; <HI>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</HI> Mal. 2.10. Surely then we ought openly to own him as &s;uch, and publickly to manife&s;t our honour, reverence and regard for him. He is likewi&s;e our common bountiful Benefactor; He be&s;tows upon us not only the private per&s;onal &amp; particular Mercies that we enjoy, but all tho&s;e publick Ble&s;&s;ings that we enjoy in common with others. As Men are joyned and united together in Bodies or So|cieties, whether Natural, Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tick, &s;o there are mercies &amp; favours which they need, and which they receive as &s;uch a Society or Community. And &s;urely there is all the rea&s;on in the World, that as &s;uch they &s;hould acknow|ledge their dependance upon GOD, by uniting their prayers for the publick Mercies they need, and their prai&s;es for tho&s;e favours they have received. But it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o much to con&s;ider the ju&s;tice and rea&s;onablene&s;s of publick Wor&s;hip, as it is an honour due to GOD; but as it is an In&s;tituted Means of Grace and &s;o the &s;uitablene&s;s of it to promote the Conver&s;ion, and Sanctification of Sinners.</P>
<P>Therefore I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The In&s;tituting publick Wor&s;hip is an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom in GOD, as it has &s;uch a wonderful aptitude and fitne&s;s (thro' the operations of the Spirit of GOD accompanying it) to begin and to increa&s;e the Work of Grace within us.</HI></P>
<P>By what has been formerly &s;aid, it appears that acts of Wor&s;hip, &s;uch as prayer, reading and hearing the Word, and the like, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

helps to Conver&s;ion, altho' performed in a pri|vate manner; but they are much more &s;o when they are done in Publick A&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;ti|ans, all joyning together in divine Service And now this way of wor&s;hipping GOD is eminently &s;erviceable on the&s;e accounts, <HI>viz.</HI> as it gives credit to Religion, and as it gives Men an op|portunity for making an open Profe&s;&s;ion of it, and al&s;o as it &s;erves to &s;timulate, to animate and quicken us in our duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The wor&s;hipping of GOD in a publick man|ner is wi&s;ely contrived as it &s;erves to give credit, and reputation to Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certainly of great advantage to the intere&s;t of Religion, and would very much tend to promote the &s;ame in and among Men, to have all bars, hindrances and impediments removed out of the way, and to have all po&s;&s;ible encou|ragements to induce, and per&s;wade us to the embracing of it. And now con&s;idering how pre|cious a good Name is in it &s;elf, and con&s;idering how naturally we de&s;ire the honour and prai&s;e of Men, no outward con&s;ideration can be more powerful to per&s;wade us to the external profe&s;|&s;ion and practice of Religion, than its being in fa&s;hion, its being a thing of good report and for a Man's honour to profe&s;s and practice it. And altho' this be a very inferiour motive to Religi|on, and what will by no means render our reli|gious performances acceptable to GOD; yet by being brought into the practice of Religion from &s;uch a con&s;ideration, they may at length by the Spirit of GOD &s;etting in be led to act from higher
<PB N="301" REF="002987_0306_0FE6B36FF52D8680">
and more noble Principles. And now Religion and the wor&s;hip of GOD being carried on in a publick manner &s;erves very much to give repu|tation to it, and thereby to recommend it to our practice: for when all Men among whom we dwell make a publick profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and in a publick manner attend religious duties, they hereby declare for it, they own it, and approve of it; and &s;o it can't be any &s;hame or di&s;grace, but an honour and reputation to a Man to be religious, nay it is a &s;candal and a reproach to a Man in &s;uch a Place not to be religious. And thus we find it among our &s;elves, that becau&s;e every Man almo&s;t attends upon religious Duties in a publick manner, it is &s;o far from being a reproach to be religious, that &s;uch are branded with infamy and di&s;grace that are openly and profe&s;&s;edly Irreligious. So that this is one ad|vantage of publick Wor&s;hip, or of Religion's be|ing carried on in an open publick manner, that it prompts &amp; encourages every Man that has a regard to his credit and good name, to attend upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Publick Wor&s;hip is a very &s;uitable means of Grace, and &s;o wi&s;ely contrived, as by it <HI>we make a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emn profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and thereby bind our &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ster to GOD, and to our Duty.</HI></P>
<P>By our joyning our &s;elves with any Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, we make a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. And by every act of publick Wor&s;hip, we openly, and in the pre|&s;ence of all the People profe&s;s, and declare our &s;elves to be the Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST:
<PB N="302" REF="002987_0307_0FE6B3700E27CB68">
every time we come to the Hou&s;e of GOD for divine Wor&s;hip, we declare CHRIST to be our LORD and Ma&s;ter, we profe&s;s a &s;ubjection to his Laws and Ordinances, and an entire con|formity to his Will, as it is revealed to us in his Go&s;pel. We profe&s;s to love &amp; &s;erve him, we profe&s;&s;edly &amp; in the eye of the World make a &s;olemn &s;urrender, and dedication of our &s;elves to GOD.</P>
<P>Now &s;uch a publick act of Wor&s;hip is very proper, as it is a mighty &s;pur and motive to Religion; for he that in a publick &s;olemn man|ner profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian, if he be not void of thought and con&s;ideration, will be led to look upon him&s;elf under peculiar obli|gations to be religious, becau&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion: for if he thinks any thing of the matter, he will bethink how unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd it is to profe&s;s to be Chri&s;tians to the World, and to attend upon the external Duties, and not be Chri&s;tians in our hearts; he will think how ab&s;urd it is to call Chri&s;t Lord, Lord, as he does by going to his Hou&s;e &amp; Ordinances, and not be careful to do what he Commands. He will al|&s;o mo&s;t naturally be led to think how provo|king it mu&s;t needs be to GOD and CHRIST to mock him, as he does when he don't live as he profe&s;&s;es and pretends by his outward Atten|dance on Ordinances; and now &s;urely &s;uch thoughts will have a mighty tendency to &s;tir Men up to &s;ee to it that their hearts and lives be more agreable to their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="303" REF="002987_0308_0FE6B37C154D8D60">3. Publick Wor&s;hip is very proper as <HI>it &s;erves very much to quicken and &s;tir up our Devotion.</HI></P>
<P>All private and &s;ecret acts of Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hip have a tendency to put us into a grave, &s;erious and devout frame of &s;pirit, but more e&s;pecially is it &s;o as to all acts of publick Wor&s;hip. When Chri&s;tians joyn together in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, they &s;timulate and &s;tir up one another to a higher &s;train of Devotion, and make one ano|ther more lively, active &amp; vigorous in the Wor|&s;hip of GOD. If we are apt to be dull, lifele&s;s and formal in private Duties of Religion; yet the joyning with others in tho&s;e Duties will oftentimes &s;erve to cure us of &s;loth &amp; dulne&s;s, and make us fervent in &s;pirit when we are &s;er|ving the Lord.

Furthermore it is con&s;i|dered as our conforming to Chri&s;t in his Death, and his Re&s;urrection, that as he died for &s;in and ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification; &s;o Bapti&s;m &s;ig|nifies our dying to &s;in, and living to righteou&s;|ne&s;s. For thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 6.3, 4. <HI>Know ye not that &s;o many of us as were bapti&s;ed into Je&s;us Christ, were baptized into his Death; therefore we are buried with him by bapti&s;m into death, that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life.</HI> And now if we con&s;ider the&s;e things, the outward &s;ign, and the things &s;ignifyed by Bapti&s;m, we &s;hall &s;ee a great deal of &s;ignificancy, &s;uitablene&s;s and propriety in the Ordinance to an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed, even to prepare and di&s;po&s;e us to receive the Grace of GOD; and &s;o the wi&s;dom of GOD in appointing it.</P>

And what could be more &s;ignificant of this than Water?

Moreover Chri&s;t is very frequent|ly &s;poken of in the Old Te&s;tament under this Metaphor. Thus he is called, <HI>A well of living Waters,</HI> and <HI>Streams from Lebanon,</HI> Cant. 4.15.

<P N="1">1.

<P>It is cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainly an advantage to a Man to be bound unto his duty, provided he be &s;en&s;ible of his obligations, becau&s;e this will put him upon u&s;ing the greater care and endeavour to do it, and will put him upon being the more earne&s;t with GOD for his Grace to help him in it. Now he that is Baptized, if he will give him|&s;elf leave to think, will be naturally led to con|&s;ider, that by his Bapti&s;m he is laid under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to be the Lord's, he will con&s;ider that by his Bapti&s;m he is made a mem|ber of that body of which Chri&s;t is the head, and therefore ought to be in entire &s;ubjection to him: He will con&s;ider that by his Bapti&s;m he is dedicated and given up to GOD, and that

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Ordinance is a very fit in&s;trument to prepare us to receive the Grace of GOD, as it gives us all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement to be &s;eeking after it, and the &s;ure&s;t foundation to depend upon obtaining it.</HI></P>
<P>In order to our obtaining the Grace of GOD, we mu&s;t &s;eek for it and as we mu&s;t have &s;ome encouragement to put us upon &s;eeking, &s;o it is
<PB N="310" REF="002987_0315_0FE6B38D8CEE70A8">
nece&s;&s;ary that this &s;eeking &s;hould be with hum|ble hope and confidence of obtaining. <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, but let him ask in faith nothing wavering,</HI> Jam. 1.5, 6. But now this faith, or confidence mu&s;t be upon &s;ome foundation, and among other things our Bap|ti&s;m affords a very good foundation for us to depend upon GOD for his Grace. For by Bap|ti&s;m we are united to Chri&s;t as to our head, and now this we may be a&s;&s;ured of, that Chri&s;t as the head is willing to communicate to all his mem|bers. We by Bapti&s;m are ingraffed into him, and &s;urely he will as readily convey &s;piritual life and nouri&s;hment into us, as the root &amp; &s;tock does to the branches, if we are but ready to re|ceive it. In &s;hort, as I have &s;aid before, it is a Seal of the Covenant of divine Grace wherein Chri&s;t with all the ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant are not only repre&s;ented, but are ready to be be&s;tow|ed upon us, if we will but receive him: the Word and Covenant of GOD &s;tands engaged to this in Bapti&s;m, which gives us all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urance of obtaining upon our &s;eeking. And now our having &s;uch a&s;&s;urance enables us to &s;eek with the confidence that is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare us to receive it. Many other things might be &s;aid as to the u&s;efulne&s;s of Bapti&s;m, and &s;o the Good|ne&s;s, and the Wi&s;dom of GOD in making it a &s;tanding Ordinance in his Church.</P>
<P>But I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is an Or|dinance wonderfully adapted, for conveying Spiri|tual &amp; Saving benefits unto our Souls.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="002987_0316_0FE6B39A4886E838">This is an Ordinance in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t the Night before he &s;uffered&punc; a particular account of which In&s;titution we have, <HI>Matth.</HI> 26.26. And in other Evangeli&s;ts The outward Elements &amp; Signs are Bread &amp; Wine, broken and poured out, eaten &amp; drunk, by which religious Ceremony is repre&s;ented and &s;ignifyed the Death and Suffe|rings of Chri&s;t for us. 1 Cor. 11.26. <HI>For as of|ten as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death till he come.</HI> But then it is not only a repre&s;entation of his &s;ufferings, but of all the ble&s;&s;ings that he has purcha&s;ed by his Death; yea, and an actual Exhibition of them to all that come in a right manner to the Ordi|nance. 1 Cor. 10.16. <HI>The cup of ble&s;&s;ing which we ble&s;s, is it not the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t? and the bread which we break, is it not the commu|nion of the body of Christ</HI>?</P>
<P>Furthermore, this Ordinance is to be con&s;ide|red as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, as well as Bapti&s;m, wherein as GOD promi&s;es and en|gages all the benefits of the New Covenant to us; &s;o we do herein renew our Covenant-engage|ments to GOD. Every time we come to this Or|dinance we profe&s;&s;edly renew the dedication of our &s;elves to GOD, and lay our &s;elves under new and fre&s;h obligations to love him &amp; &s;erve him, and to keep all his Commandments.</P>
<P>And now he that will but con&s;ider the Ordi|nance it &s;elf, the nature, and the de&s;ign of it, will &s;ee that it is wi&s;ely contrived to an&s;wer it's de|&s;ign, even to convey the Grace of GOD unto us if not for our Conver&s;ion, yet at lea&s;t for our &s;piritual

nouri&s;hment, and growth in Grace. It is an Ordinance that has a wonderful tendency to put as into a &s;erious, devout frame of &s;pirit, to &s;tir up our affections, and thereby fit and prepare our hearts for the Spirit of GOD to work upon. Nay it gives us &s;uch lively repre&s;entations of Chri&s;t, of his dying love, and his &s;aving benefits, that our eye affects our heart to &s;uch a degree as to put every Grace within us into exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus for in&s;tance, what could be contrived more powerfully to di&s;cover to us the evil of Sin, and &s;o to di&s;po&s;e our hearts to unfeigned Re|pentance for all our Sins, than to &s;ee the Eter|nal SON of GOD wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities? What could better convince us of the infinite Evil there is in Sin, than to &s;ee the cruel &s;ufferings that the Son of GOD endured before he could make A|tonement for it? What could be more effectual to &s;et us again&s;t &s;in, and to beget an hatred and abhorrence of it within us, than to &s;ee the &s;or|rows, the tortures, the inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies it put the Son of GOD unto, when it was but Im|puted to him? And what could &s;erve better to &s;trengthen our re&s;olutions again&s;t &s;in for the time to come, than to &s;ee Chri&s;t bleeding and dying for &s;in, and to con&s;ider that by our return|ing again to &s;in we do as it were crucify afre&s;h the Lord of Life, and put him to an open &s;hame? Now all this is done in the holy Sacrament, for therein Chri&s;t is evidently &s;et forth as cru|cifyed among us.</P>
<P>Again, what better way could there be con|trived to &s;tir up devout affections, and to inflame
<PB N="313" REF="002987_0318_0FE6B39CE2B3A2F0">
our hearts with love, than to have a &s;en&s;ible re|pre&s;entation of an Unparallel'd in&s;tance of infinite love made unto us? What could &s;erve better to fill our hearts with love to GOD and CHRIST, than to &s;ee GOD expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch infinite love to us as to give his only begotten, and dearly be|loved Son to dye for us? And to &s;ee the Lord JE|SUS CHRIST expre&s;&s;ing a love to us &s;tronger than death, which many waters could not quench, nor the floods drown? To &s;ee him who knew no &s;in of his own, made &s;in for us, and to bear our &s;ins in his own body on the tree, and to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t cruel, cur&s;ed and &s;hameful death on our accounts? Verily GOD has commended his love to us in that while we were yet Sinners, CHRIST dyed for us; and &s;urely our hearts mu&s;t be very hard and &s;tupid, if they are not warmed &amp; melted, if they are not all in a flame of love at the &s;en|&s;ible repre&s;entation of this dying love in the holy Sacrament.</P>
<P>Again, what better and more effectual method could be taken to excite and &s;trengthen our faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, than to &s;ee him &s;uffering the penalties of the law for us, and &s;atisfying the demands of divine Ju&s;tice on our account, and &s;o making way for GOD, con&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s, and the honour of all his perfections, to pardon, and accept us? What can &s;erve better to convince us that he is the al&s;ufficient Saviour, able to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t; than to &s;ee him not only pleading in our behalf, but to &s;ee him paying the price for our ran&s;om, to &s;ee him make his Soul an offering for &s;in, and pouring it
<PB N="314" REF="002987_0319_0FE6B39CF808C1D0">
out unto death for us, and thereby fini&s;hing tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and making an end of &s;in, and bringing in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s? All which is &s;et before us in this ble&s;&s;ed Ordinance, and that in &s;uch a lively and affecting manner, that whil&s;t we are at it, celebrating the Memorials of his death, our Souls will make their boa&s;t in GOD their Saviour, &s;aying with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chri&s;t that dyed, yea rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us. Who &s;hall &s;eparate us from the love of Chri&s;t</HI>? Rom. 8.34, 35.</P>
<P>And thus I might go on to other in&s;tances, but the&s;e may &s;uffice to &s;how how well this Sacrament is adapted to excite and &s;trengthen divine Grace within us, and &s;o the Wi&s;dom of GOD in this ble&s;&s;ed In&s;titution.</P>
<P>And thus I have con&s;idered the in&s;tituted Means of Grace, tho&s;e that we are to make u&s;e of, and give our Attendance upon, and have taken notice of the Wi&s;dom of GOD appearing in the &s;uitablene&s;s and propriety of them to an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next thing I am to con&s;ider is, the Means that GOD him&s;elf makes u&s;e of, Namely, The dealings and di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence towards us, and to ob&s;erve how wi&s;ely GOD or|ders things in the cour&s;e of his Providence to pro|mote our Conver&s;ion, and growth in Grace; but this mu&s;t be defer'd to another opportunity: And I &s;hall conclude with a brief Improvement of what has been offered at this time.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="315" REF="002987_0320_0FE6B3A9B439F6F0">1. <HI>How Thankful &s;hould we be for the free En|joyment of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Ordinances?</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly it is an un&s;peakable favour and privilege to have liberty to go to the Hou&s;e of GOD, and there to attend upon him in the duties of his publick Wor&s;hip. It is what the Primitive Chri&s;tians were oftentimes debarr'd from, and when ever they met together for the wor&s;hip of GOD it was in jeopardy of their lives; and this has been the lot, &amp; portion of many of the Saints in almo&s;t all ages of the Church. But now we, in&s;tead of having any thing to debar, or hinder us from the publick wor&s;hip of GOD in the ways of his appointment, have all po&s;&s;ible encourage|ment for it. We are Invited &amp; Commanded to attend publick wor&s;hip, not only by the Word of GOD, but by the Civil Authority placed over us, even &s;o far as to expo&s;e our &s;elves not only to di&s;|grace, but even to humane Penalties for the neg|lect. Now &s;urely this is a favour &amp; privilege that calls for our highe&s;t thankfulne&s;s. How thank|ful would the Primitive Chri&s;tians, and the Per|&s;ecuted Saints be for &s;uch liberties as we enjoy? And therefore if we have the true &s;pirit &amp; tem|per of Chri&s;tians, we &s;hall be grateful for, and careful how we improve &s;uch peculiar advanta|ges. This is the language of the devout P&s;almi&s;t, and will be of every true Saint in &s;ome good mea|&s;ure. <HI>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Ho&s;ts!

<P>It is very evident that &s;ome per&s;ons are very carele&s;s about attending the publick Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of GOD in his Hou&s;e.

Others there are that from a &s;pirit of Dei&s;m and Infidelity de&s;pi&s;e the Ordinances: for denying the divine Authority of the Scriptures, they by con&s;e|quence deny the obligations to attend the Ordi|nances therein pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Others there are that altho' they don't run to the &s;ame exce&s;s of folly &amp; madne&s;s in their Prin|ciples, yet have too &s;lighty apprehen&s;ions of the nece&s;&s;ity of attending the publick Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of GOD's Hou&s;e. They will pretend they can profit as much by &s;taying at home, and Reading &s;ome good Books in their own hou&s;es, as by going to the Hou&s;e of GOD; that they can Read as good or better Sermons at home than they hear at the Church; and &s;o &s;ometimes from &s;ome prejudice again&s;t the Mini&s;ter, or from &s;ome little bodily Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or from &s;ome little difficulty

<P>And then again, others there are who altho' they come to the Hou&s;e of GOD, and attend the more common parts of divine Wor&s;hip; &s;uch as the Prayers, the Singing, and the Preaching of the Word, yet are very carele&s;s and negligent about attending upon the Sacraments. Some remain Unbaptized for a long time, or if they have been given up to GOD in Bapti&s;m, yet they neglect to renew the dedication of them&s;elves by their own act, they live many years without owning the Covenant; and when they do it, they are even forced to it, to e&s;cape the &s;candal and di&s;grace of their Childrens being Unbaptized; &amp; when they have gone &s;o far in order to their receiving Bap|ti&s;m for their Children, yet here they come to a &s;tand, and neglect to renew and ratify their Co|venant engagement at the holy Supper, but in|&s;tead thereof for many years, nay oftentimes all their days turn their backs upon that holy Ordi|nance.</P>
<P>Now what we have heard &s;erves to reprove all &s;uch per&s;ons, and leaves them utterly inexcu&s;able whoever they are.

<HEAD>Sermon, XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I Am yet upon the con&s;ideration of the Means of Grace, and of the Wi&s;dom of GOD that appears in the Methods that are taken for bring|ing Men into, and carrying them on in a &s;tate of Grace. And you may remember that I di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the Means of Grace into tho&s;e that GOD has In&s;tituted &amp; Appointed for us to attend upon: &s;uch as written Word, and all the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel: and tho&s;e Means that GOD him|&s;elf makes u&s;e of, &s;uch as the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence. Now I have already con&s;idered tho&s;e Means of Grace that GOD has In&s;tituted and Appointed for us to attend upon; in order to our having the divine Grace conveyed thro' tho&s;e &s;acred Channels into our Souls; and as I went along I endeavoured to &s;how the wi&s;dom of GOD in appointing &s;uch Means for us, by &s;hewing the &s;uitablene&s;s and fitne&s;s of them to an&s;wer the end. propo&s;ed in the In&s;titution of them.</P>
<P N="2">II. And now my bu&s;ine&s;s at this time is to con&s;ider the other outward Means of Grace that are made u&s;e of in the Conver&s;ion of Sinners, and for their further progre&s;s in Grace and Holine&s;s, Namely, <HI>The di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence towards us.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD makes u&s;e of Providences as well as Ordinance in bringing Sinners home unto him&s;elf, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> evident from the frequent, if not con&s;tant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Saints; for there are

&s;carce any that have been brought into a &s;tate of Grace, or that have made any advances in it, but what (if they have been careful in their ob&s;erva|tion) will be able to &s;ay that the Providences of GOD have been very helpful to them. And he that will but con&s;ider the manner of GOD's dealings, and di&s;pen&s;ations towards Sinners in the cour&s;e of his Providence before their Conver&s;ion, and afterwards for their progre&s;s in Grace, will &s;ee a great deal of the Wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</P>
<P>Here therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider the various di&s;|pen&s;ations of divine Providence made u&s;e of in the bringing per&s;ons into a &s;tate of Grace, and for their progre&s;s &amp; growth therein, and the wi&s;dom of GOD that appears in them from the fitne&s;s; and natural tendency of them to prepare Mens hearts for the impre&s;&s;ions of divine Grace. For if the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence are &s;o ordered, is to be very fit means, or in&s;truments in the hand of the Spirit for promoting our Conver&s;ion and Sanctification, we mu&s;t acknowledge that they are ordered in wi&s;dom. But before I pro|ceed to con&s;ider any of the di&s;pen&s;ations of Pro|vidence in particular, I would ob&s;erve this in general, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That GOD's making u&s;e of &s;o great a variety of Providences towards tho&s;e he is about to bring, or has brought into a &s;tate of Grace, is an in&s;tance of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD is very various in the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence towards the Children of Men, and even towards tho&s;e that he intends, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about to be&s;tow &s;aving Grace upon, is &s;ufficiently

evident to every Man of any ob&s;ervation or ex|perience. Some he cha&s;tens with the rod of Af|fliction, and that in a very great variety both as to kind &amp; degree. Some he exerci&s;es with In|ward troubles, the troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Mind; &s;ome with Outward troubles, &s;uch as &s;ick|ne&s;s and pain, poverty, reproach, and contempt, lo&s;&s;es, cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments. But then on the other hand, others there are that GOD cau&s;es goodne&s;s and mercy to follow them; he &s;atisfies their Mouth with good things, and crowns them with loving kindne&s;s, and tender mercies. But then oftentimes the &s;cene is changed with re&s;pect to the &s;ame per&s;ons. GOD does &s;eldom or never keep the &s;ame cour&s;e with any per&s;on all his life long but he is often changing his hand with them, &s;ometimes laying Afflictions on them, and then removing his hand from off them, and cau&s;ing them to &s;ee good days according to the days wherein they have &s;een evil. This we &s;ee to be the Method of GOD's dealings and di&s;pen&s;ations towards the Children of Men, not confining him|&s;elf to any particular, certain way of managing us, but putting us &s;ometimes into pro&s;perity, and &s;ometimes into adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>And now GOD, exerci&s;ing &s;uch a variety of Providences is very wi&s;ely contrived. Becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is &s;uch a difference in the natural Tempers of Men whom GOD brings into a &s;tate of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Whether from the different Formation of our Bodies, or the various Contexture of the Parts, or however el&s;e it comes to pa&s;s, yet it is mo&s;t cer|tain,
<PB N="323" REF="002987_0328_0FE6B3C0D5B96E90">
that there is a very great difference in the natural tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of Men, di&s;tinct from that which is made by the renewing and &s;anctifying Grace of GOD; and therefore they require a very different way of management to prepare them for the reception of divine Grace at fir&s;t, or for their improvement in it afterwards. So different are the tempers of Men, that the &s;ame kind of Providences, con&s;idered only in their natural tendency, will have a very different effect upon them. And altho' it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that GOD by his Almighty Spirit, can make any Providence produce the &s;ame effect upon the mo&s;t different &amp; oppo&s;ite tempers; yet a Providence that would be very &s;erviceable to one Man on &s;piritual accounts, would (&s;eparate from the &s;pe|cial operations of the Spirit) be very hurtful to another. Some Mens natural tempers are &s;uch that they can't bear a great deal of outward Pro&s;|perity, a full &s;ail would over&s;et &amp; de&s;troy them; it would exalt them above mea&s;ure, and make them grow proud &amp; in&s;olent, it would lead them into an unmindfulne&s;s &amp; regardle&s;sne&s;s of GOD, and of their duty to him, and all his goodne&s;s would be turned into wantone&s;s; their Spirits are &s;uch as need to be kept under, and nothing but a &s;eries of Afflictions &amp; Troubles can keep them humble, or make them thoughtful &amp; con&s;iderate: whereas on the other hand, there are other Men who&s;e natural tempers are &s;uch, that they can be more ea&s;ily led and drawn to Repentance by the goodne&s;s of GOD, than driven by Afflictions, that are apt to be dejected, di&s;couraged, and even to
<PB N="324" REF="002987_0329_0FE6B28383877528">
fall into de&s;pair when the hand of GOD lyes heavy upon them: if they meet with Afflictions their Spirits are apt to &s;ink under them, they are rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to give out, to neglect their duty &amp; bu&s;ine&s;s from &s;uch a de&s;pairing thought as this, that it is in vain to &s;erve the Lord any longer; and &s;o ma|ny &s;uch per&s;ons in&s;tead of being driven from their &s;ins, and driven nearer to GOD by Afflictions, they are driven further from him, and make their ca&s;e more difficult &amp; de&s;perate than before.</P>
<P>And now con&s;idering the various tempers of Men, and what different ways of management are requi&s;ite to produce the &s;ame effect; it mu&s;t needs be wi&s;dom in GOD to make u&s;e of a variety of Providences, and deal very differently with tho&s;e whom he de&s;igns to bring home unto him|&s;elf, as the mo&s;t likely way to an&s;wer the end.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The temper of every particular Man is &s;uch, as makes it nece&s;&s;ary for him to be exerci&s;ed with a great variety of Providences.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' from the different tempers of Men &s;ome require more of one kind of Providences than a|nother, yet there are none but what require a change of Providences. It is very requi&s;ite for the mo&s;t part that GOD &s;hould be changing his hand, &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ing Mercies, and &s;ometimes Af|flictions to us. As for Pro&s;perity, there is &s;carce any Man that can bear an uninterrupted &s;eries of it; it would be very difficult, and &s;omething extraordinary would be nece&s;&s;ary to be done to keep down &s;uch a Mans Pride, and to make him humble and penitent, and to keep him &s;o. How
<PB N="325" REF="002987_0330_0FE6B28E722D13D8">
difficult would it be to convince a Man (that &s;hould meet with no interruption or di&s;turbance in his worldly Enjoyments) of the evil of &s;in, when he feels &s;o little of the ill effects of it? How difficult to per&s;wade him that GOD was angry with him for his &s;ins, when he cau&s;es goodne&s;s and mercy to follow him continually? So again how could &s;uch a Man have &s;uch a feeling, convincing &s;en&s;e of the vanity of the World, and all things in it as to de&s;pi&s;e it, and rai&s;e his heart above it? How would a Man come to him&s;elf, and be brought to &s;erious thought &amp; con&s;ideration? How would he be awakened out of his carnal &s;loth &amp; &s;ecurity, and quickned to &s;eek after another and a better Place if he did not meet with afflictions to inter|rupt his pre&s;ent comfort? In &s;hort, we are all by nature &s;uch fools, as that a life of uninterrupted pro&s;perity would de&s;troy us</P>
<P>And then on the other hand, the ca&s;e would be as difficult and dangerous for us&punc; for who could bear with a con&s;tant cour&s;e of &s;orrow and trouble, without any metigation or relief? If Men were kept in the fire of affliction, and under the rod of divine correction, without any mixture of outward comforts; <HI>The Spirit would fail before him, and the &s;ouls that he hath made.</HI> Men would be very apt to be di&s;couraged from &s;eeking the Lord or wait|ing upon him they will (when his hand lyes long and heavy upon them) be ready to murmur and complain, to have hard thoughts of GOD, and think it is vain to &s;erve him and will mo&s;t cer|tainly want the proper motives to love him: and altho' they may be brought to &s;ee &s;omething of
<PB N="326" REF="002987_0331_0FE6B28E8997AC58">
the evil of &s;in from the ill effects of it which they feel; yet this is not likely to produce any thing more than an attrition which is only a &s;orrow for &s;in, becau&s;e of the evil effects and con&s;equen|ces of it upon our &s;elves, and not that true con|trition of Soul which con&s;i&s;ts in an hearty &s;or|row for &s;in from a love to GOD, and becau&s;e he is di&s;honoured and offended thereby.</P>
<P>And now as we &s;ee that no particular way of dealing with any per&s;on &s;erves to well as a vari|ety of Providences, therefore GOD is often chan|ging his hand, &s;ometimes di&s;pen&s;ing mercies, &s;ome|times afflictions, as he &s;ees the ca&s;e calls for: As he is <HI>leading them to Repentance by his goodne&s;s, drawing them with the cords of a man, and the hands of love</HI>; &s;o it is as certain, that <HI>whom the Lord loves he cha&s;tens, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such a variety of Providences is very u&s;eful to Men in their pre&s;ent &s;tate and condition, let it be what it will, which &s;hows the Wi&s;dom of GOD in &s;uch frequent Changes and Alternations he orders out for us.</HI></P>
<P>Such frequent changes of Providence are of &s;er|vice to Men, whether they are at pre&s;ent in pro&s;|perity, or in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;uppo&s;ing a Man at pre&s;ent in very pro&s;|perous and comfortable Circum&s;tances, if GOD was not wont to alter his di&s;pen&s;ations, &s;uch an one would think that his mountain &s;tood &s;trong, and that he &s;hould never be moved, he would put far from him the evil day, and would be ready to &s;ay, Soul take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink &amp; be merry,
<PB N="327" REF="002987_0332_0FE6B28FB0A4A300">
for thou ha&s;t goods laid up for many years, and GOD and Religion, and the grand concerns of his Soul would be laid a&s;ide. But now GOD by or|dering &s;uch frequent Changes, and giving &s;uch &s;udden turns in his Providences takes away all rea&s;on and foundation for Mens depending upon a long uninterrupted continuance of their pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances; for when they &s;ee and con|&s;ider the many changes that have happened to others, they cannot but look upon their own pre&s;ent de&s;ireable condition to be very uncertain. The Providences of GOD being &s;o various, we can look upon nothing as certain that we po&s;&s;e&s;s. Riches for ought we know may take to them&s;elves wings &amp; fly away; friends may for&s;ake us, health may be de&s;troyed, and all our comforts fail us at once. And now the uncertainty of earthly En|joyments is of great &s;ervice to us, and &s;o wi&s;ely ordered by GOD, as it &s;erves very much to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;en our e&s;teem of earthly things, and prevent our putting our tru&s;t and confidence in them.</P>
<P>So on the other hand, if Men were under afflic|tive Circum&s;tances, if GOD never altered his hand throughout the cour&s;e of a Man's life, &s;uch would be dejected &amp; di&s;couraged, they would &s;unk under the thoughts of &s;pending all their days in mi&s;ery and &s;orrow, and would be ready upon &s;uch terms to choo&s;e &s;trangling and death rather than life: but now GOD's varying and changing his hand is a mighty &s;upport and encouragement to &s;uch. This gives them grounds to hope the &s;cene will be changed as to them, and that they &s;hall &s;ee good days according to the days wherein they have
<PB N="328" REF="002987_0333_0FE6B28FC9CCBE48">
&s;een evil; this enables them patiently to bear their pre&s;ent calamity, and encourages them to pray for deliverance, and quietly to wait for the &s;alvation of GOD.</P>
<P>But thus much for the wi&s;dom of GOD in order|ing out variety of Providences for us in general.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider, <HI>Some of the di&s;pen&s;ati|ons of divine Providence, that are made u&s;e of to prepare us for the Grace of GOD, or to advance us in it; and the wi&s;dom of GOD appearing therein, from the fitne&s;s and tendency of them to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider. The <HI>Merciful di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence, and we &s;hall &s;ee them well adapted to an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed, and &s;o the wi&s;dom as well as goodne&s;s of GOD in ordering out the &s;ame unto us.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD does frequently di&s;pence his fa|vours to the Children of Men, and cau&s;e goodne&s;s and mercy to follow them is too evident for the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible or ungrateful to deny, and there|fore there is no need of &s;pending time for the proof of it. He is frequently cau&s;ing his good|ne&s;s to pa&s;s before us, yea the whole Earth is full of his goodne&s;s; and we have all ta&s;ted &amp; &s;een that the LORD is good, altho' &s;ome have received more largely of his goodne&s;s than others. Some are wonderfully &s;miled upon &amp; pro&s;pered in the world. <HI>Job</HI> was &s;uch an in&s;tance, of which he gives an elegant de&s;cription after the &s;cene was changed, Chap. 29th. at the beginning, <HI>O that I were as in months pa&s;t, as in the days when God pre&s;erved me, when his candle &s;hined upon my head,
<PB N="329" REF="002987_0334_0FE6B29A19F35750">
&mdash; when the &s;ecret of God was upon my taberna|cle, when the almighty was yet with me; when my children were about me; when I wa&s;hed my &s;teps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oyl,</HI> &amp;c. And this is the ca&s;e of many per&s;ons, GOD cau&s;es whatever they do to pro&s;per, he gives them health and &s;trength, riches and honour, peace &amp; plea&s;ure. And now this is a wi&s;e and proper management towards &s;ome per&s;ons that GOD is about to bring or has already brought into a &s;tate of Grace.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As it may be very helpful in leading them to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' outward peace and pro&s;perity may be hurtful to &s;ome tempers, and &s;erves to harden them in &s;in rather than &s;often, and melt them into penitence: and altho' an uninterrupted cour&s;e of pro&s;perity may be dangerous for any, and lead them into an unmindfulne&s;s of GOD, and of their duty to him; yet there are &s;ome that can bear a turn of outward Pro&s;perity; and the merciful Providences of GOD, by the concurring influences of his Spirit, prove &s;oftning and melting to them, and help to lead them to or carry them on in an ingenious &s;orrow for &s;in. For when a Man con|&s;iders that he as well as others is a Child of di&s;|obedience, and &s;o a Child of wrath, and that he has been as great a Sinner all his days as many others have been, and yet when he &s;ees GOD puni&s;hing and correcting others for their &s;ins, in the &s;ore afflictions that he is bringing upon them, exerci&s;ing them with poverty and contempt, with &s;ickne&s;s &amp; pains, with lo&s;&s;es and cro&s;&s;es of every
<PB N="330" REF="002987_0335_0FE6B29A30833468">
kind: and he who has been as great a Sinner is &s;pared, and not only delivered from the&s;e evils; but encompa&s;&s;ed with all the comforts of life. I &s;ay, when a Man does thus con&s;ider how boun|tifully GOD deals with him beyond what he has to others, no more unworthy than him&s;elf; it mu&s;t needs have a tendency to inlarge his heart in love and thankfulne&s;s to GOD, and help to fill him with &s;hame and &s;orrow for his &s;ins, which have been &s;uch ungratefull returns to GOD for his benefits. Kindne&s;&s;es have a natural tendency to &s;often us, and if there be any &s;park of ingenui|ty, they will &s;tir it up within us; and this is the end of GOD's goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s, to &s;tir up our ingenuity, if we have any, and to bring us to an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">genuous &s;orrow for our &s;ins; <HI>the goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance,</HI> Rom. 2.4. And it is not to be doubted but that many a Man has been very powerfully wrought upon by the goodne&s;s of GOD: Some remarkable in&s;tances of it have made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon Mens hearts as have never been worn off, and which have been &s;o cul|tivated &amp; improved by the concurring influences of GOD's Spirit, as to produce an ingenuous &s;hame and &s;orrow for &s;in, an hatred of it, and full re&s;olutions again&s;t it. Merciful Providences when accompanied with the Spirit of GOD will &s;erve wonderfully to &s;often Mens hearts, to di&s;|&s;olve them into tears of Godly &s;orrow &amp; penitence for &s;in, even unto a Repentance unto Salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Merciful di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Provi|dences &s;erve to inlarge our hearts in love &amp; thank|fulne&s;s to GOD, and to encourage us in his Ser|vice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="002987_0336_0FE6B29DBAD562D8">If GOD &s;hould be cha&s;tning us with the rod, &amp; vi&s;iting us with &s;tripes continually, we &s;hould be apt to have hard thoughts of him as unkind and unmerciful; we could not have &s;uch reali|zing &amp; &s;en&s;ible apprehen&s;ions of his goodne&s;s and his mercy, as we ought. And if he &s;hould continue his hand heavy upon us, whil&s;t we are endeavouring to &s;erve him, and to conform our &s;elves unto his precepts, it would be very apt to di&s;courage us, and be a &s;trong temptation to lay a&s;ide all religious duties, and break forth in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of anger and de&s;pair, as tho&s;e, Job 21.15. <HI>What is the Almighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him? and what profit &s;hall we have if we pray unto him?</HI> And in 2 King. 6.33. <HI>Behold this evil is of the Lord, why &s;hould I wait for the Lord any longer?</HI></P>
<P>But now GOD by di&s;pen&s;ing his favours to us, and be&s;towing the ble&s;&s;ings and comforts of this life upon us, helps to give us a quite different apprehen&s;ion of him: this convinces us of his goodne&s;s &amp; his mercy, in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible man|ner, and by having &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Convictions of the immence goodne&s;s of GOD, we &s;hall have our hearts inlarged in love and thankfulne&s;s un|to him, and our mouths filled with prai&s;es. <HI>Abrahams</HI> Servant was &s;o affected with the good|ne&s;s of GOD in giving him &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s in his &s;eeking a wife for his Ma&s;ters Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> That <HI>he bowed his head and wor&s;hipped the Lord,</HI> Gen. 24.26. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were &s;o affected with the good|ne&s;s and mercy of GOD in their deliverance out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and in the overthrow of the Aegyptians

<P>But then, the merciful providences of GOD, &s;erve not only to excite our love &amp; gratitude, but al&s;o to encourage us to engage in his Ser|vice, and to go on in it with the greater chear|fulne&s;s: Every act of kindne&s;s helps to confirm us in this, That he is a good Ma&s;ter to &s;erve, and that he is a plentiful rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him. The P&s;almi&s;t was encou|raged to learn and to ob&s;erve GOD's Statutes upon the account of the divine goodne&s;s both in his nature, and in the communications of it in his Providence, P&s;al. 119.68. <HI>Thou art good, and doe&s;t good, teach me thy &s;tatutes.</HI> And &s;urely the con&s;ideration hereof, and e&s;pecially the daily experience of the divine goodne&s;s and mercy, affords abundant encouragement to engage in the ob&s;ervance of his Commandments; for &s;ince GOD is &s;o good, as all the in&s;tances of his good|ne&s;s to us manife&s;t him to be, we may conclude that his Commandments are good, and that in keeping of them there will be a great reward.</P>

<P>Thus, if GOD is plea&s;ed to ble&s;s a Chri&s;tian with a good E&s;tate, and a plentiful &s;upply of the good things of this life, it will give him an op|portunity for, and his heart being inclined by the Grace of GOD, he will actually honour the Lord with his Sub&s;tance, by imploying a &s;uita|ble proportion of it in acts of Piety &amp; Charity, in propagating &amp; &s;upporting the Go&s;pel, and there|by advancing the intere&s;t of Religion, in which the glory of GOD is mo&s;t of all concerned, and al&s;o in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;upplying the wants of the Poor and needy, by which means, <HI>The ble&s;&s;ing of him that is ready to peri&s;h will come upon him.</HI> And not only &s;o, but hereby he will make to him&s;elf friends of the Mammon of un|lighteou&s;ne&s;s, which when he fails will receive him into everla&s;ting Habitation.

<P>There is nothing of outward Means that has a more powerful tendency to awaken Men out of their carnal &s;loth and &s;ecurity, to put them upon &s;erious thought and con&s;ideration, or that is &s;o effectual to di&s;cover the evil nature and con&s;equences of &s;in, as afflictions.

<P>Afflictions are as nece&s;&s;ary for the Soul, as Phy&s;ick is for the Body, they &s;erve to purge a|way iniquity, and to take away &s;in, and make us partakers of divine Holine&s;s. And now &s;ince nothing of outward means is more powerful than afflictions for the bringing us home to GOD, &s;o the wi&s;dom of GOD appears in ordering out afflictions for &s;uch as he has purpo&s;ed and de|termined to bring into a &s;tate of Grace. But as there are &s;everal kinds of afflictions that GOD exerci&s;es &s;uch withal in order to their Conver&s;i|on, &s;o I &s;hall mention &s;ome of them, and very

briefly hint at the &s;pecial u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;ome af|flictions in particular, &amp; &s;o the wi&s;dom of GOD in the particular kinds of afflictions that he makes u&s;e of. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes GOD exerci&s;es per&s;ons with lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, and reduces to Poverty, even to &s;uch &s;traits and difficulties that they know not how to turn them&s;elves, for a comfortable &s;upport in the World.</HI></P>
<P>But now GOD is very wi&s;e &amp; prudent in this, becau&s;e it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome per&s;ons to be thus dealt withal, and it &s;erves for many good purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, it &s;erves to <HI>give Men a most &s;en&s;i|ble demon&s;tration of the Vanity of the World, and &s;o affords a powerful argument to wean us from it.</HI></P>
<P>We are all apt to be fond of the World and the things of it, we are apt to place too much dependance upon earthly Riches; but now GOD by depriving us of the&s;e outward comforts, by con&s;uming our E&s;tates, &amp; wa&s;ting our Sub&s;tance, and bringing us to Poverty, he effectually teaches us, they are all uncertain Riches, not fit for us to place any confidence in, he hereby gives us a feeling &s;en&s;e and realizing apprehen&s;ion of the truth of what the Preacher &s;ays, Eccl. 1.2. <HI>Va|nity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</HI></P>
<P>But then again, <HI>Cutting us &s;hort with re&s;pect to outward good things, and reducing us to &s;traits and difficulties, may be very &s;erviceable to bring us to ca&s;t our care upon GOD, and to place our dependance more and more upon him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="002987_0342_0FE6B2B32DE3F878">We are all exceeding apt to wor&s;hip the Creature, by putting too much tru&s;t &amp; confidence in it: We are ready to &s;ay to the Gold, Thou art my hope, to the fine Gold, Thou art my confi|dence; &amp; &s;o tru&s;t in uncertain riches more than in the living GOD. But now GOD by taking away th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things that we more e&s;pecially de|pend upon, leads us to depend upon him, and to be ca&s;ting our care upon him; for when other things fail, it affords an argument for our going to GOD, and tru&s;ting in him and waiting upon him. Such a condition will quicken as to apply our &s;elves to our heavenly Father, as our Savi|our has directed, <HI>to give us our daily bread</HI>; for when the &s;treams (on which we had too much dependance) are dried up, we &s;hall be naturally led to the fountain.</P>
<P>But then again, <HI>Such low and difficult Circum|&s;tances give Men the opportunity of Exerci&s;ing and Improving in the Grace of Contentment.</HI></P>
<P>The time for the Exerci&s;e of Contentment &s;o as to appear any great virtue in us, or for us to improve in this Grace, is the time of outward adver&s;ity, when our circum&s;tances are low and difficult in the World, &amp; &s;o there is the &s;tronge&s;t temptations again&s;t it. For by &s;triving after Contentment with &s;uch things as we have, and again&s;t Envy at tho&s;e who are in better Circum|&s;tances, we &s;hall advance in this excellent Grace, and come nearer and nearer to the &s;pirit and temper that was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="002987_0343_0FE6B2B346EC7600">And then la&s;tly, <HI>Poverty, and the want of out|ward good things, may &s;erve very much to quicken us in our pur&s;uits after heavenly Riches.</HI></P>
<P>When all things here below fail, when a Man is poor and low in the World, and has little or nothing of this Worlds goods to depend upon, this will lead him to think of other Riches, and will afford a very good argument to him to be laying up trea&s;ures in heaven. The Apo&s;tle tells us, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.5. That <HI>God hath cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the king|dom, which he hath promi&s;ed to them that love him.</HI> And now when a Mans outward riches fail him, and he grows poor and low in the world&punc; how natural will it be for him to take encouragement from the words of the Apo&s;tle to be&s;tir him&s;elf &s;o as to become rich in faith, and to &s;ecure a more enduring &s;ub&s;tance than any thing here below, even bags that wax not old, a trea&s;ure in the heavens.</P>
<P>And now if Poverty or Straitne&s;s of Circum|&s;tances has a tendency to, and will if &s;anctified by the Spirit of GOD produce &s;uch good effects, it is certainly wi&s;dom &amp; kindne&s;s in GOD to or|der it out for the lot &amp; portion of &s;ome per&s;ons. Indeed <HI>Agur</HI> de&s;ired to be delivered <HI>from Poverty</HI> as well as <HI>Riches,</HI> and it mu&s;t be acknowledged to be a thing very unde&s;irable, yea, and attended with many &s;nares &amp; temptations; yet we have rea&s;on to believe, and acknowledge that it is a &s;tate of life very nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome per&s;ons, who&s;e tempers are &s;uch, that they would pine and grow poor in Grace, if worldly Riches &s;hould be increa&s;ed to them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="339" REF="002987_0344_0FE6B2B6A3894658">2. <HI>Sometimes GOD afflicts per&s;ons with Re|proach, Di&s;grace and Contempt.</HI></P>
<P>And this he does in wi&s;dom, for it &s;erves many <HI>good purpo&s;es,</HI> which I mu&s;t only briefly mention.</P>
<P>Thus &s;uch kind of Affliction &s;erve very much <HI>to &s;ubdue and mortify our Pride.</HI></P>
<P>For when we &s;ee others de&s;pi&s;e us, and have but a mean opinion of us, it will lead us to &s;u&s;|pect, whether we have not had too high thoughts of our &s;elves, and will have a tendency to mode|rate our opinion of our &s;elves, and bring us to a complyance with the direction of the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 12.3. <HI>That a man think not of him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think, but to think &s;oberly, according as God hath dealt to every men the mea|&s;ure of faith.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, A Mans &s;uffering in his Name and Reputation, and lying<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> under any re|proach and &s;candal, will have a tendency to make him the more watchful and circum&s;pect, it will be an argument with him to take more heed to him&s;elf, to his Words and to his whole Carriage &amp; Conver&s;ation. If he has any regard for his good Name (which is as great riches) he will endeavour by a blamele&s;s life and con|ver&s;ation to recover his reputation, and regain his credit among Men, <HI>and that tho&s;e who have &s;poken evil of him as of evil doers, may be a&s;hamed as fal&s;ely accu&s;ing his good conver&s;ation in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>But then la&s;tly, It will have a tendency to make Men careful to approve them&s;elves unto GOD, and their own Souls, that when others reproach &amp; de&s;pi&s;e them, their own Con&s;ciences

may have no occa&s;ion to reproach them, &s;o long as they live, but that they may have this for their rejoycing in the mid&s;t of outward contempt and &s;corn, even the te&s;timony of a good Con|&s;cience&punc; That in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of GOD they have had their Conver&s;ation in the World.</P>
<P>So that upon the&s;e accounts, reproach and contempt from the World may be a very u&s;e|ful and profitable Affliction to us.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Oftentimes GOD afflicts with bodily Sickne&s;s and pains, by which he brings them down, even to the very gates of the Grave, and &s;o under fearful apprehen&s;ions of Death.</HI></P>
<P>And this is ordered in Wi&s;dom, as it &s;erves many important u&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus, when &s;ickne&s;s &s;eizes violently upon us, and death begins to &s;tare us in the face, it &s;erves at once to rouz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us out of our carnal &s;loth and &s;ecurity, and puts us upon thinking of Death and Judgment, and ETERNITY in good earne&s;t; it puts us upon more earne&s;t prayer to GOD for his Mercy and Grace, than at any other times. It al&s;o &s;tirs us up to examine our &s;elves, upon looking back upon our pa&s;t lives, and renewing our repentance and &s;orrow for &s;in, and it excites the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s and diligence in making our Calling and Election &s;ure. Moreover, &s;uch times of &s;ickne&s;s and danger, cau&s;es all the Glory of this World to vani&s;h and di&s;appear, and to be de&s;pi&s;ed in our Eyes; then we have a more &s;en|&s;ible apprehen&s;ion of the vanity of the World, and of all things in it.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="002987_0346_0FE6B2BFCCE06300">Furthermore, a time of &s;ickne&s;s and danger puts us upon making &s;olemn promi&s;es and re&s;o|lutions, that we will for&s;ake our &s;ins, and live more to the glory of GOD than ever; which altho' they are too often forgotten when their &s;ickne&s;s and danger is over, yet when it is ac|companied with the Spirit of GOD, it leaves &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ions upon Mens minds as have a mo&s;t powerful influence upon their lives ever after; their re&s;olution, and their care has been like that of the P&s;almi&s;t&punc; P&s;al. 66.13, 14. <HI>I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath &s;poken, when I was in trouble.</HI> And &s;urely when it has &s;uch effects as the&s;e, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to rejoyce and be thankful to GOD all our days, for his wi&s;dom and his goodne&s;s in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vi&s;iting of us.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Sometimes GOD exerci&s;es with inward trou|bles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and this al&s;o with a great deal of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>GOD &s;ometimes hides his face from his Chil|dren, and then they are troubled, their fears and doubts ari&s;e about their &s;piritual Condition, and they are greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their Minds lea&s;t they are yet in their &s;ins, and &s;o under the wrath of GOD, and in danger of Hell, and eternal De|&s;truction. Now altho' &s;uch &s;piritual doubts and fears are &s;ome of the &s;ore&s;t Afflictions we can meet with in the World; (<HI>for a wounded &s;pirit who can bear?</HI>) yet the tendency of them is &s;uch, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kes them capable of, and they oftentimes do prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to us.</P>
<P>For &s;uch kind of afflictions put Men upon Ex|amining

them&s;elves with the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s imaginable, to find what is ami&s;s; by which means if there be any &s;in or lu&s;t lurking in them, it will be di&s;covered, to be repented of, and for|&s;aken.</P>
<P>And then again, it puts Men upon a more clo&s;e walking with GOD, and upon the greate&s;t care and watchfulne&s;s lea&s;t they fall into &s;in. When a Man is under &s;uch doubts &amp; fears about his &s;piritual State, he will be more careful how he performs duty, and more fearful of neglecting it, or being formal &amp; lifele&s;s in the performance of it. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his mind will make him fervent in &s;pirit whil&s;t he is &s;erving the Lord. And then when GOD &s;hall return to &s;uch an one, and &s;peak peace unto him, the Experience he has had of the &s;ad Condition of tho&s;e who have GOD withdrawn from them, will make him careful lea&s;t he return again unto folly, and thereby &s;hould again have the light of GOD's coun|tenance hid from him.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Sometimes GOD in his holy Providence permits tho&s;e whom he is bringing, or has brought into a &s;tate of Grace, to fall into gro&s;s and &s;canda|lous Sins,</HI> which in the conclu&s;ion proves very u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to them, and &s;o the wi&s;|dom of GOD is to be &s;een &amp; acknowledged in it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, GOD permits them to fall, for he does not by any po&s;itive act of his cau&s;e them to fall; but he for wi&s;e and good rea&s;ons &s;ees cau&s;e &s;o far to withdraw his re&s;training Grace, that they are overcome by the temptations they meet with, and &s;o fall into &s;ome &s;candalous &s;in; &s;ometimes

Now altho' the&s;e things reflect great di&s;honour upon GOD, and are very provoking and offen&s;ive to the pure Eyes of his Glory, wounding to Mens Souls, and hurtful to Religion, yet GOD who can bring good out of the greate&s;t evil, does &s;ometimes &s;o order it, as that &s;uch gro&s;s and &s;candalous falls prove u&s;eful and &s;erviceable to a Man afterwards. Nay I believe it has oftentimes proved a very great in&s;trument of a &s;inners Conver&s;ion: his having committed a &s;candalous &s;in puts him upon more thoughtfulne&s;s than ever he exerci&s;ed before; and he is led by it to con&s;ider the evil there is in &s;in in general, as well as of that &s;in in particular; and we may oftentimes ob&s;erve per&s;ons growing more &s;erious and circum&s;pect after &s;ome &s;candalous fall, than ever they were before. Furthermore, it &s;erves to humble them, and cau&s;es them to walk &s;oftly all their days. It al&s;o leads them to con&s;ider the weakne&s;s, &amp; impotency of Men when left to them|&s;elves, and will lead them to be more watchful again&s;t tho&s;e things that have in times pa&s;t pro|ved in&s;naring to them: and &s;o, in &s;hort, one foul and &s;candalous &s;in &s;ometimes prevents many le&s;s notorious ones, which yet might have been as of|fen&s;ive to GOD. Moreover, the &s;candalous falls of &s;ome &s;erve as warnings to others, and may make them more upon their watch and guard: for they admini&s;ter this coun&s;el, and admonition to all, 1 Cor. 10.12. <HI>Let him that thinketh that he &s;tand|eth,

<P>I might go on to in&s;tance in &s;ome other parti|cular Afflictions, and &s;how the u&s;efulne&s;s of them on &s;piritual accounts. I might likewi&s;e take oc|ca&s;ion to ob&s;erve the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence towards the wicked and ungodly, even &s;uch as live and dye in their &s;ins, even the merciful and afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence towards &s;uch, and &s;how to what good purpo&s;e they are capable of being improved by others, for the bringing them into, or forwarding them in Grace and Holine&s;s; and &s;o the wi&s;dom of GOD that appears in them. Thus I might &s;how that the awful Judgments which GOD oftentimes in his Providence brings upon Sinners in this World, is capable of being improved to great advantage by others, as it &s;erves very convincingly to di&s;cover the divine hatred and abhorrence of &s;in, and to warn us of the danger of going on in any &s;inful cour&s;es; &amp; &s;o oftentimes &s;erves to deter per&s;ons from going on in their &s;inful practices, left they &s;hould fall under the like terrible Judgments.

<P>So al&s;o might I &s;how how the outward pro&s;pe|rity that GOD affords &s;ometimes to Sinners, may
<PB N="345" REF="002987_0350_0FE648B66F510980">
be of great u&s;e and &s;ervice to the Children of GOD. For altho' we are ready to cry out with wonder &amp; &s;ay, <HI>Wherefore doth the wicked pro&s;per</HI>? And altho' the P&s;almi&s;t confe&s;&s;es, <HI>That his feet were almo&s;t gone, and his steps had well nigh &s;lip'd, and he was envious at the fooli&s;h, when he &s;aw the pro&s;perity of the wicked.</HI> P&s;al. 73.1, 3. Yet it will appear that GOD has very wi&s;e &amp; gracious de&s;igns in it, e&s;pecially towards his Children, even to &s;trengthen their faith, and to advance them in Grace and Holine&s;s. Thus for in&s;tance, it affords a very good argument for a future &s;tate, wherein GOD will make a remarkable difference between him that &s;erveth GOD, and him that &s;erveth him not. Moreover, it may &s;erve to give us a more inlarged thought of the glorious rewards of the other World, and a meaner apprehen&s;ion of the goods of this pre&s;ent World; for by this we &s;ee that GOD e&s;teems the goods of this World as no|thing, not worth the making a difference, as to them, between the righteous and the wicked.

<P N="1">1. <HI>It is matter of &s;hame &amp; humiliation, that we have made no better Improvement of the various di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="002987_0351_0FE6B2C226C8E4E0">By what we have heard, we learn, That every Providence whether Merciful or Afflictive may be improved to great advantage, and may help us forward in Grace &amp; Holine&s;s; but what improve|ment have we made of them?

That goodne&s;s of his which &s;hould have led them to Repentance, has been ba&s;ely abu&s;ed, by our taking encouragement there-from to go on &s;till in our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. On the other hand, GOD has been &s;ometimes driving us by the rod of Correction, but we oftentimes have been &s;o &s;tupid as to refu&s;e to receive In&s;truction by it. We have been Murmuring and Impatient under Afflictions, and have hardned our Necks under Reproofs, in&s;tead of returning to him that has been &s;miting of us. Now we have rea&s;on to be humble that we have made no better advantage of the various turns of Providence, and may well blu&s;h and be a&s;hamed that we have made &s;uch an ill improvement of them; and &s;urely many of you who have been &s;o ungrateful, and &s;o incorrigible, may ju&s;tly fear that GOD will &s;peedily leave you to your &s;elves, will let you alone, and u&s;e no more means with you to reclaim you, but will give you up to your own hearts lu&s;ts, and then every turn of Providence, in&s;tead of being any way &s;ervice|able to you, will only &s;erve to help you fill up the mea&s;ure of your &s;ins, and ripen you the fa&s;ter for eternal De&s;truction.</P>

<P>For &s;ince every Providence is capable of being improved to good advantage, and &s;ince GOD knows what kind of Providences are be&s;t for us, we ought to acquie&s;s in all his di&s;pen&s;ations. Who need Murmur or be Impatient under Afflictions, when every Affliction may be of &s;o great profit to us. Afflictions oftentimes prove the means of our Conver&s;ion &amp; Salvation, they &s;erve to further the Saints in Grace, and to work out for them a far more exceeding &amp; an eternal weight of glory; what foundation then is there for Murmuring or Impatience under Afflictions? We may be &s;ure that the Father of Spirits cha&s;tens his Children for their profit, and therefore if we would govern our &s;elves by Rea&s;on, we &s;hould de&s;ire GOD to order out &s;uch a &s;tate of life for us, as will be mo&s;t for our &s;piritual Advantage, even altho' it be an afflicted one. <HI>To Conclude,</HI></P>
<P>Let us all ob&s;erve the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence towards us, and let us con&s;ider how every turn of Providence may be improved by us, and in what ways e&s;pecially they may be helpful to us in working out our Salvation.

<P>WE are yet upon the Fourteenth general In&s;tance of the wi&s;dom of GOD in the affair of our Redemption, Namely the <HI>Application of this Redemption to us, and the manner of it.</HI></P>
<P>And for the regular handling of this point you may remember that I divided the Redemption that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, and which is applyed to us into three general parts, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Pardon &amp; Ju&s;tification of the Sinner.</P>
<P N="2">2. His Regeneration or Conver&s;ion, and the progre&s;s of Grace in Sanctification.</P>
<P N="3">3. His Glorification, or eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t of the&s;e have been particularly, and di&s;tinctly handled. And I have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure &s;hewn how the wi&s;dom of GOD has abounded not only in the manner of a &s;inners Ju&s;tication, but al&s;o in the means and methods made u&s;e of

for our Regeneration and Sanctification. And I am now come to the la&s;t or fini&s;hing &s;troke of our Redemption, <HI>viz. our Glorification.</HI> As Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed Pardon and Grace, &s;o he has purcha&s;ed eternal Life and Glory for us. And now in the application, or be&s;towment of this glory and hap|pine&s;s, there will be bright di&s;coveries of divine wi&s;dom and prudence to &s;uch as &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;i|der the nature of this Glory, and the &s;teps and methods taken in receiving us unto it.</P>
<P>So then,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the Glorification of the Saints, or in GOD's receiving any of the Children of Men to his King|dom and Glory, there appears a great deal of Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>Under this head I propo&s;e to con&s;ider &s;omething of the nature of the Glory it &s;elf. The Per&s;ons that &s;hall be received to it. The Evidences and A&s;&s;urances GOD is giving of it. And the Time and Manner of arriving at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and en|joyment of it. Each of which will make &s;ome Con&s;iderable Di&s;coveries of the divine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Nature and Degree of the Glory &amp; Hap|pine&s;s that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, and is now pre|paring for us, is &s;uch as to manife&s;t and di&s;cover the Wi&s;dom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed as for this Glory and Happine&s;s, it is out of the reach of our Capacities to comprehend; much le&s;s to de&s;cribe.

Neverthele&s;s the Scriptures do give us &s;ome general hints concer|ning the &s;tate of the ble&s;&s;ed by which we may have &s;ome general, but not adequate Ideas of the heavenly Glory. Thus we may gather from the Scriptures, that altho' the happine&s;s of Hea|ven is repre&s;ented by &s;en&s;ible Metaphors; yet that it is not a carnal, but a &s;piritual kind of hap|pine&s;s; that we &s;hall be made perfect in holine&s;s; that there wont be the lea&s;t Inclination, nor Pro|pen&s;ion to &s;in remaining in us, but that we &s;hall be perfectly pure and holy; and that we &s;hall dwell in the pre&s;ence of GOD and CHRIST, and have a mo&s;t glorious vi&s;ion, and full fruition of him; that we &s;hall enjoy every thing that can gratify our pure and perfectly refined natures, even Rivers of plea&s;ure and fulne&s;s of joys; and that every thing that can di&s;turb or afford any unea&s;ine&s;s to us &s;hall be entirely bani&s;hed that ble&s;&s;ed Place; that all the former things will be entirely pa&s;&s;ed away, that there will be no more &s;ickne&s;s nor pain no more &s;orrow, nor any more death, but all tears &s;hall be wiped away from our Eyes. It is likewi&s;e repre&s;ented as a &s;tate where|in we &s;hall have the greate&s;t honour conferr'd upon us and &s;hall be employed in the mo&s;t de|lightful Exerci&s;es, even to joyn in Con&s;ort with all the holy Angels in &s;inging Prai&s;es and Hallelu|jahs, giving ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory and power to him that &s;itteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="002987_0356_0FE6B2D6B5AAD888">Moreover, the account the Scriptures give con|cerning the duration of the Glory is, that it is <HI>Eternal</HI>; and &s;o will never have an end: It is called <HI>eternal Life,</HI> an <HI>everla&s;ting Kingdom; A crown of glory that fadeth not away; an Inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI> And now here is <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e this is a glory and happine&s;s &s;uited to our rational Nature.</HI></P>
<P>As it is infinite goodne&s;s in GOD to provide a happine&s;s for his Creatures, &s;o he di&s;covers his wi&s;dom in &s;uiting the happine&s;s to the nature of the Creature on whom he be&s;tows it. That which would be a compleat happine&s;s to one kind of Beings, would not be &s;o to another: that which would be a compleat happine&s;s to a meer &s;en&s;i|tive Creature, can by no means be &s;ufficient for a rational one. Now GOD has wi&s;ely con&s;idered our frame and con&s;titution, and has provided a happine&s;s that is altogether &s;uitable to &s;uch na|tures as ours. We are in our make and con&s;ti|tution not meerly &s;en&s;itive, but rational Creatures: we have rational and immortal Spirits formed within us; and as this is the mo&s;t noble part of our con&s;titution, &s;o GOD has had a particular regard to the Soul in the happine&s;s he has provi|ded for us. The good which he has laid up for them that love and fear his Name, is of &s;uch a nature, as to gratify all the rational and immor|tal de&s;ires of our Souls, in a more e&s;pecial manner&punc; Indeed many Men thro' the carnality of their hearts, and their having been &s;trangers to any other but &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, are ready to imagine
<PB N="352" REF="002987_0357_0FE6B2D6CDC01C70">
the happine&s;s of Heaven to con&s;i&s;t in the free and full gratification of their &s;en&s;itive Appetites: but what a poor kind of happine&s;s would this be for a man, for a rational Being? What &s;atisfaction would that be to a rational &amp; immortal Soul? And there|fore GOD in his infinite Wi&s;dom has con&s;idered us as Men, and not as Bea&s;ts, in the happine&s;s he has re&s;erved in Heaven for us: and has &s;uited it to our Superiour, that is to our Spiritual &amp; Rati|onal part. But then as our bodily and fle&s;hly Appetites, if they are ungratifyed afford a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s &amp; di&s;turbance to us, and would interrupt and hinder the Soul from taking the full delight and &s;atisfaction in divine and &s;piritual Enjoyments; therefore GOD has wi&s;ely taken care that we &s;hall not carry &s;uch gro&s;s &amp; &s;en&s;itive Appetites with us to Heaven. The&s;e gro&s;s and corruptible Bodies, and con&s;equently the&s;e gro&s;s and carnal and &s;en&s;itive Appetites will be left be|hind, and our Bodies will be refined and &s;piritua|lized before they get to Heaven. They are to lye down in the Grave and &s;ee Corruption; but they will be refined in their Re&s;urrection; <HI>It is &s;own a natural body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.44. And con&s;equently the de&s;ires of the whole Man will be pure and &s;piritual in the Re&s;urrection State, and &s;o the happine&s;s of Heaven which is of a &s;piritual Na|ture will be altogether &s;uited to our refined Na|tures, and will perfectly gratifie every de&s;ire, we &s;hall carry with us into that high &amp; holy place.</P>

<P>It is highly proper that when GOD is plea&s;ed of his &s;overeign grace to Adopt any of his Crea|tures, &amp; bring them into the high &amp; near relation of Children, he &s;hould be&s;tow &s;omething on them worthy of &s;uch a Father, who is the high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth, to give to &s;uch as are his Children and his Heirs. And now as GOD thro' the riches of &s;overeign Grace has been plea&s;ed to make choice of &s;ome of the Children of Men, to make them his own Children by Regeneration, and by Adoption, &s;o they are look'd upon &amp; con|&s;idered as Heirs of GOD, even Co-heirs with CHRIST. For thus the word of GOD allows us to argue, Rom. 8.17. <HI>And if Children then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chri&s;t.</HI> Now I &s;ay, &s;ince they are the Children &amp; the Heirs of GOD, it is highly proper the Inheritance &s;hould be &s;uch an one as is worthy of &s;uch a great, &s;uch an heavenly Father to grant, and &s;uitable for the Children of &s;uch a Father to receive.

Their Souls are re&s;tored to their primitive rectitude and perfection: the Image of GOD, which con&s;i&s;ts in knowledge, righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s, is re|impre&s;&s;ed upon their natures; they are clean&s;ed from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and are per|fected in holine&s;s, and thereby are fitted for the pre&s;ence of the holy GOD, and to dwell in the high and holy place, and fitted for the So|ciety of holy Angels, and to joyn with them in holy Exerci&s;es &amp; Imployments. And after &s;uch a manner is every true Believer, who are the per|&s;ons GOP calls to his Kingdom and Glory, fitted and prepared for it beforehand. Every Saint has an heavenly temper wrought in him before ever he is brought to dwell in Heaven. They are all trained up in the bu&s;ine&s;s and employ|ments of Heaven, while&s;t they are here upon the Earth, in&s;omuch that Heaven may be &s;aid be be|gun with them, even whil&s;t they are here upon Earth: for the devout wor&s;hipping and &s;erving GOD in religious duties here in his Tabernacles below, and the &s;weet communion &amp; fellow&s;hip, the delight and joy, the Saints do often experience in them, are emblems of the mo&s;t glorious Servi|ces, the ravi&s;hing delights and joys of his Temple above. For the difference lies not &s;o much in kind, as in perfection and degree. So that the Saints, the Children of GOD, and the Heirs of Heaven, are here in the School of Chri&s;t trained up to it whil&s;t on Earth; and when they are made meet for, they are received to the Inheri|tance

<P>Now &s;urely, it is wi&s;dom in GOD to exclude all &s;uch as are &s;o unfit for that glorious place; for why &s;hould he receive &s;uch into the heavenly Glory, that would not only pollute and defile the place, interrupt and di&s;turb the ble&s;&s;ed Society there, but would de&s;pi&s;e and reject the glories of that place, and take no manner of delight or &s;a|tisfaction in them!</P>

<P>When we con&s;ider what vile and &s;inful crea|tures we are by nature, and what infinite provo|cation we have offered to GOD by our &s;inful practices, and how much we have de&s;erved, and &s;o how ju&s;t it would be with GOD to have pun|i&s;hed us with an everla&s;ting de&s;truction from his pre&s;ence, and from the glory of his power, into the Lake that burns with fire &amp; brim&s;tone; and when we con&s;ider that in&s;tead of this there is an

<P N="2">2. <HI>Since there is &s;uch a glory and happine&s;s pro|vided for the Saints, and re&s;erved in the Heaven for them, let us have our Eye continually upon it.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould be frequently meditating upon the future glory and happine&s;s, we &s;hould be often thinking with our &s;elves of the greatne&s;s and the excellency of it: we &s;hould con&s;ider it as a good &s;uited to our natures, to afford a perfect happine&s;s unto us; as that which is able to &s;atisfie the mo&s;t inlarged de&s;ires of our Souls, and what is commen&s;urate al&s;o with the everla&s;ting duration of them. I &s;ay, let us mu&s;e and meditate on this happine&s;s, and let us

compare it with the world and all the fading glories of it: and it would &s;erve wonderfully to fill us with an holy contempt of this world, and all its enjoyments. Then we &s;hall &s;ee and be convinced, that there is nothing in this world, not all the pomp, riches and grandeur of it, to be compared with the glory that &s;hall hereafter be revealed in us. The fervent, &s;erious and rea|lizing thought of the heavenly glory, would rai&s;e up our affections from earth to Heaven; we &s;hould then &s;et our affections on things a|bove, and not on things on the earth. If we would &s;pend more time to think upon Heaven, and the happine&s;s of it, our Souls would not cleave unto the du&s;t, as now they do; we &s;hould not look upon this world as our home, we &s;hould not look upon the riches of it as our trea&s;ures, nor content our &s;elves with a portion here, but we &s;hould be for laying up trea&s;ures in Heaven. This would put us upon living above this world, and would q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icken us in our pur&s;uit after, and preparations for the coming world. This would quicken us to endeavour after tho&s;e things that accompany Salvation, and that are nece&s;&s;ary to qualify us for the Inheritance among them that are fanctifyed. Having this hope in us, and ha|ving it frequently in exerci&s;e, we &s;hall <HI>be purify|ing our &s;elves, even is God is pure; clean&s;ing our &s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, perfect|ing holine&s;s in the fear of God</HI>; that &s;o we may be fit <HI>for the high, and the holy place, into which nothing can enter that defiles.</HI> And it is becau&s;e Men don't take time to think of the&s;e things,
<PB N="365" REF="002987_0370_0FE6B2FB271BB418">
nor to bring them&s;elves to a realizing apprehen|&s;ion of them, that they are &s;o little affected with them, and are &s;o carele&s;s in &s;ecuring an intere&s;t in them. Wherefore let us think more of Hea|ven, &amp; le&s;s of the pre&s;ent world: and it is mo&s;t certain, that if our trea&s;ure was in Heaven, our hearts would be there al&s;o; yea, and our Con|ver&s;ation would then be more in Heaven than now it is.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From what we have heard, we may gather one very good rule by which to judge of our &s;elves, whether we have an intere&s;t in the future Glory, or not; Namely, our being fitted &amp; qualifyed for it.</HI></P>
<P>For by what has been &s;aid, we find that none &s;hall ever go to Heaven, but &s;uch as by the Grace of GOD are fitted and prepared for it. As the ve&s;&s;els of wrath are <HI>fitted</HI> for de&s;truction, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.22, 23. &s;o the ve&s;&s;els of mercy are afore <HI>prepared</HI> unto glory and &s;uch are made <HI>meet</HI> for the Inheritance among the Saints in light, before they become partakers of it, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.12. So that none can go to Heaven, but &s;uch as are fit for the high and holy place. And therefore the be&s;t way to know whether we have an intere&s;t there, is to &s;ee, and examine our &s;elves, whether we are fit for it: if we can find our &s;elves fitted and prepared for Heaven, we may depend upon it that we have an intere&s;t, and &s;hall in due time have an open entrance mini&s;tred to us into the everla&s;ting Kingdom. For GOD never fits a per&s;on for glory and happine&s;s, but he will re|ceive him unto it at la&s;t. But if we don't find our &s;elves fitted for it, if we don't find a &s;piritual,
<PB N="366" REF="002987_0371_0FE6B2FB4EED55B8">
holy, heavenly frame of Spirit, producing a blamele&s;s, heavenly Conver&s;ation, we may con|clude that we have no lot or portion there.</P>
<P>Wherefore let us all Examine and Try our &s;elves by this rule; let us look into our hearts, and let us ob&s;erve our lives to &s;ee what manner of per&s;ons we are. Let us &s;ee whether we have &s;uch a &s;uperlative love to GOD and CHRIST reigning in our Souls, as fills us with the mo&s;t longing de&s;ires after, and the greate&s;t delight in having Communion, and fellow&s;hip with the Father, and with the Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Does it appear to us to be our greate&s;t happine&s;s, to dwell in the pre&s;ence of GOD, to be imployed in &s;erving, prai&s;ing and glorifying of him for ever? Have we &s;uch an hatred of &s;in, and love to holine&s;s wrought in our Souls, that Heaven recommends it &s;elf to us chiefly, becau&s;e of its perfect purity and holine&s;s? Is the Society of the Saints on Earth the mo&s;t delightful Com|pany to us? And is &s;erious, &s;piritual, heavenly di&s;cour&s;e and conver&s;ation with them the mo&s;t de&s;irable and delightful to us? Can we call the Sabbaths of the Lord our delight? And is it with the voice of joy and prai&s;e, that we go to the Hou&s;e of the Lord, and attend upon him in the duties of Religion? Now if we can find the&s;e things in us we find a heavenly temper, and a fitne&s;s for Heaven, and may upon good grounds depend upon obtaining an Entrance in|to it; the&s;e heavenly qualifications are earne&s;ts and pledges of the glory &amp; happine&s;s we &s;hall at length be brought to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P>

<P>GOD in his infinite wi&s;dom has &s;een cau&s;e for ever to Exclude &s;uch the Kingdom of Heaven, who have not been born again, but live and dye in their &s;ins; and from what we have heard, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ee there is a great deal of rea&s;on for it. Now therefore what folly is it for an ob&s;tinate impe|nitent Sinner to hope for or expect it, whil&s;t he continues in &s;uch a &s;tate? For Heaven, as we have &s;aid, is an high and holy place, into which nothing &s;hall or can enter that defiles, that work|eth abomination, or that maketh a lye. Now he that is under the guilt, and filth of &s;in, having never been wa&s;hed in the blood of the Lamb, mu&s;t needs be very polluting &amp; defiling to the holy place: and therefore 'tis not po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an one to enter. Moreover, how can a Man with all his &s;ins upon him think of approaching before the holy GOD? With what face could he appear in his pre&s;ence, that has &s;o often re|belled again&s;t him, before he has humbled him|&s;elf to the very du&s;t for his &s;in, and has obtained pardon and reconciliation with GOD thro' Chri&s;t? But if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that GOD would deny him&s;elf &s;o far, as to permit &s;uch an one to enter thro' the gates into the cele&s;tial City, what would he do there? You that never loved GOD, nor any of his ways here on earth, and who&s;e language to GOD has been, <HI>Depart from us, for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways</HI>; what plea&s;ure can you think of taking in
<PB N="368" REF="002987_0373_0FE6B309B95A28D0">
approaching before GOD in paying religious Wor&s;hip and Adoration to him for ever, when the &s;hort &s;ervices of his wor&s;hip are &s;uch a wea|ri&s;omne&s;s and burden to you whil&s;t on earth? You that never loved the Saints on earth, but hated, de&s;pi&s;ed &amp; rejected them, with what plea|&s;ure can you think of being linked to them for ever? Or what plea&s;ure could you take in them? Verily you would be burden&s;ome and unea&s;y to each other. In &s;hort, as the Apo&s;tle argues, 2 Cor. 6.14, 15. <HI>What fellow&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? and what communion hath light with darkne&s;s? and what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial?</HI> No more fel|low&s;hip, concord or communion could an impe|nitent Sinner have with Chri&s;t, or with the Saints in Heaven. So that it is the greate&s;t pre&s;umption, folly and madne&s;s in the world, for any whil&s;t under the dominion of &s;in, to think of going to Heaven; for they will mo&s;t certainly be di&s;appointed. Such are &s;o unfit, as well as unworthy of that place, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to gain admi&s;&s;ion; the gates of Heaven will be &s;hut again&s;t them, and altho' they cry, Lord, Lord open unto us, it will be in vain, and CHRIST their Judge will in his Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice &s;ay, Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</P>

<P>Now GOD is giving us Evidences and A&s;&s;u|rances hereof,</P>

<P>Therein we have Him a&s;&s;erting and declaring that this &s;hall be the Portion of all true Believers. Thus our Saviour tells us, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25 46. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> that is, the wicked, <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> So Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth, and is Baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> So, Rom. 2.7. <HI>To them who by pa|tient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, honour and immortality, eternal life.</HI> And &s;o in a multitude of other places, is eternal life &amp; hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="370" REF="002987_0375_0FE6B30CF5C06BF8">
&s;poken of as what every true Believer &s;hall be received unto: And it is &s;aid to be pro|mi&s;ed, and that from the beginning before the World began. <HI>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, hath promi&s;ed before the world be|gan,</HI> Tit 1.2. But then there is not only the word and promi&s;e of GOD, but he has for the further certainty of it confirmed it by an Oath. Heb. 6.17, 18. <HI>Wherein God willing more abundantly to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w unto the heirs of promi&s;e the immutability of his coun&s;el, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie, we might have a strong con&s;olation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et be|fore us.</HI> And now the&s;e exceeding great &amp; pre|cious promi&s;es being thus confirmed, make it a|bundantly evident that there is a glory &amp; a hap|pine&s;s prepared for all the Children of GOD, to which they &s;hall be received. For,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, there is Almighty Power whereby he is able to accompli&s;h his promi&s;es. None can oppo&s;e or hinder him from accompli&s;hing every word that he hath &s;poken. He has the keys of Heaven, as well as of Hell, &amp; of Death: as he can &s;hut, and none can open; &s;o he can open, and none can &s;hut.</P>
<P>And then again, the&s;e promi&s;es are &s;trengthen|ed and confirmed by Infinite &amp; Immen&s;e Good|ne&s;s, which inclines and di&s;po&s;es GOD to do good to all his Creatures, and e&s;pecially to fulfill all the good that he has promi&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>Again, the infinite Ju&s;tice of GOD &s;erves to &s;trengthen the promi&s;es; for altho' eternal Life

be the free gift of GOD unto us; yet con&s;idering it with re&s;pect to Chri&s;t our Mediator &amp; Surety, it is no more than is ju&s;tly due; for he purcha&s;ed it for us, and now according to the tenor of the new Covenant, it is an act of Ju&s;tice in GOD to be&s;tow this glory upon the Saints; and we are &s;ure that <HI>the Judge of all the earth will do right.</HI></P>
<P>And then la&s;tly, there is the immutable Truth and Faithfulne&s;s of GOD, whereby he is not only always of the &s;ame mind he was when he made the promi&s;es; but is al&s;o obliged to fulfill them, and to &s;uffer Heaven &amp; Earth &s;ooner to pa&s;s away, than one word that he hath &s;poken.</P>

<P>But now we find by Experience, that there is no remarkable difference in this life, with re&s;pect to the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine Providence; for as the Preacher &s;ays Eccl. 9.2. <HI>All things come a|like to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that &s;acrificeth, and to him that &s;acrificeth not; as is the good, &s;o is the &s;in|ner; and he that &s;weareth, as he that feareth an Oath.</HI> Oftentimes the wicked pro&s;per and grow great in the world, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued as other men.

death. <HI>Whilst &s;ome of the Saints are cha&s;tned every morning, and plagued all the day long.</HI> And now altho' this is at fir&s;t apt to excite the envy of the Saints, &amp; tempts them before they have con&s;i|dered the matter, to &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 73.13. <HI>Verily I have clean&s;ed my heart in vain.</HI> Yet upon a thorow con&s;ideration, it will be found that the&s;e are the Providences that afford the mo&s;t comfortable Evidences of the future Glory and Happine&s;s re&s;erved in Heaven for them.</P>
<P>If GOD &s;hould make a very remarkable diffe|rence between the righteous and the wicked in this world; that is, if he &s;hould cau&s;e goodne&s;s and mercy to follow the Saints, even all their days, &s;o as to make whatever they do to pro&s;per; and &s;hould be con&s;tantly pur&s;uing the wicked with plagues and judgments, till he had cut them off; we &s;hould be ready to look upon this pre&s;ent world as the place of rewards and puni&s;hments, and that the portion of the Godly was in this life. But now &s;ince the goods and evils of this life are &s;o promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ed to the Children of Men, we may &s;trongly and &s;afely argue with the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 58.11. <HI>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</HI> As certainly as he is GOD that judgeth in the Earth, &s;o certainly there is a reward for the righteous.</P>

<P>GOD knows our frame and con&s;titution, and how much we are moved by our hopes &amp; fears; He knows that the pro&s;pect of a reward is one of the mo&s;t powerful motives to duty.

The evi|dence, that GOD has given of the future glory, is well contrived to carry us thro' the duties of Mor|tification, and &s;elf-denyal; to bear with patience the afflictions and troubles of the pre&s;ent life This will enable us patiently and chearfully to bear afflictions with the people of GOD, rather than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on, being a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e light afflictions which are but for a moment, will work out for us a far more exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.

<P>Death is the king of Terrors: Nature abhors a di&s;&s;olution, and &s;hrinks at the thoughts of it: &s;o that the Saints and Children of GOD need &s;ome|thing to &s;upport them in a dying hour; &s;ome|thing

to enable them to look death in the face with courage, and with calmne&s;s of Spirit to &s;ub|mit to the fatal &s;troke. And now what could be contrived to afford &s;o much courage and comfort to them at &s;uch a time, as the joyful pro&s;pect and a&s;&s;urance of a glorious Immortality after this life is ended? What can be a greater &s;upport to us at our leaving the pre&s;ent world &amp; all our friends, e&s;tates, and earthly comforts behind us, than the hopeful pro&s;pect of going to GOD the be&s;t friend of all, to the delightful company of Angels and Saints made perfect, and to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in|finitely more &s;ub&s;tantial and enduring riches, honours, and plea&s;ures, than this world can po&s;&s;i|bly afford us? What better cordial could be provided for a fainting dying Saint, when the world, and all things here below fail, and when his fle&s;h and his heart fail, than the comfortable evidences of GOD's love, and the a&s;&s;urances that he will never leave nor for&s;ake him; but will be the &s;trength of his heart, and the portion of his Soul for ever? Verily there is nothing can afford &s;o much courage, and patience, under the la&s;t &s;truggles of nature, and the dreadful A|gonies of Death, as the pro&s;pect of having the &s;cene &s;o quickly changed, and that their pa&s;&s;ing thro' the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death is only to bring them to that glorious place, where all tears &s;hall be for ever wiped away from their eyes, where there &s;hall be no more &s;ickne&s;s, nor pain, nor any more death. So that GOD has wi&s;ely and graciou&s;ly con&s;idered us, in making known his purpo&s;es of mercy and grace to us:
<PB N="378" REF="002987_0383_0FE6B32455296B60">
how could we have been moved to our duty, or left without excu&s;e, if we had neglected it? how could we have been &s;upported under the num|berle&s;s troubles, and &s;orrows of the pre&s;ent life; and how could we have been comforted in the hour of death, if GOD had not brought life and immortality to light, and a&s;&s;ured us of that glo|rious Re&s;t that remains in Heaven for the People of GOD!</P>
<P>But thus much for the wi&s;dom of GOD in the Evidences and A&s;&s;urances he is giving us of the future glory.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;ay in the next place,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If we con&s;ider the Way and Manner by which the Saints are brought to this Glory &amp; Happine&s;s, we &s;hall &s;ee much of the wi&s;dom of GOD therein.</HI></P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They mu&s;t pa&s;s thro' the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death, before they arrive to the Regions of Light and Glory.</HI></P>
<P>It is appointed for all men once to die, Heb. 9.27. <HI>And what man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death? Shall he deliver his &s;oul from the hand of the grave?</HI> P&s;al. 89.48. The Saints are no more exempted from this decree of Heaven than Sinners: there is no di&s;charge in that war for any; the &s;econd death devours one as well as another. The Saints in all Ages have been &s;ub|ject to death as well as other men, and have not arrived to Heaven and Happine&s;s, but by under|going this di&s;&s;olution of nature. <HI>Abraham, Mo&s;es, David, Paul,</HI> and all the mo&s;t celebrated Saints that have been in the world, have pa&s;&s;ed to Hea|ven
<PB N="379" REF="002987_0384_0FE6B32FF7C9B148">
thro' this dark valley. Indeed there are two and but two in&s;tances from the beginning of the world to this day, that have e&s;caped the mortal &s;troke, and without ta&s;ting of death, did pa&s;s im|mediately Soul &amp; Body into Heaven, (only un|dergoing, as we may &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a change as will pa&s;s upon tho&s;e who &s;hall be found alive at our Lord's appearing in Judgment) Namely <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah.</HI> And here by the way I cannot but ob&s;erve the wi&s;dom of GOD in the&s;e excep|tions, and in giving to the&s;e eminent Saints an immediate pa&s;&s;age to Heaven, for among other things this great &amp; good end was an&s;wered here|by, <HI>viz.</HI> A confirming to the world not only the Doctrine of the future State, but of the Re|&s;urrection of the Body in particular. For when they were &s;een or known to be tran&s;lated up to glory, it mu&s;t needs afford a very convincing ar|gument to the other Saints, that they &s;hall at length come to the participation of the &s;ame glory, even the glory and happine&s;s of the whole man, body as well as Soul, altho' the man fir&s;t be made to &s;ee corruption; and from a &s;tate of corruption be rai&s;ed to a glorious immortality, from which tho&s;e two eminent Saints were freed.</P>
<P>And then again, we may &s;ee more of the wi&s;|dom of GOD, if we con&s;ider the particular times when the&s;e per&s;ons were in &s;uch an extraordinary manner taken up to Heaven. Thus the fir&s;t tran&s;lation, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch</HI> was in the old world before the flood. The &s;econd, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Elijah</HI> was under the law; by which there has been a very convincing Te&s;timony both to the

old world, and tho&s;e that lived under the law, of the Re&s;urrection of the body, and the future State. And as for the Go&s;pel-&s;tate, there in|deed life &amp; immortality are brought to a much clearer light, not only from the much clearer and fuller account that is given of the matter in the Scriptures of the new Te&s;tament, than of the old, but al&s;o from the Example of Chri&s;t's own Re&s;urrection from the Dead, and vi&s;ible A&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven.</P>
<P>So that there has been a &s;en&s;ible te&s;timony given for the Re&s;urrection of the body, and the future &s;tate to the three grand Ages of the world; Namely, the <HI>Antediluvian,</HI> the <HI>Legal,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>; which &s;hews the wi&s;e &amp; ten|der care GOD has taken to &s;upport the &s;tagger|ing faith of his Church, in the &s;everal Ages of it.</P>
<P>And then again, as GOD de&s;igned to make the di&s;covery of the&s;e things in a gradual man|ner, &s;o we may ob&s;erve the divine wi&s;dom in managing the&s;e tran&s;lations or a&s;cen&s;ions into Heaven in &s;uch a manner, as to render each one a brighter, and fuller Evidence than the other; thus as to <HI>Enoch,</HI> who was the fir&s;t, we have no further account of his tran&s;lation, than that <HI>He was not, for God took him,</HI> Gen. 5.24. but no ac|count of the circum&s;tances of it. But in the tran&s;lation of <HI>Elijah,</HI> the Sons of the Prophets were apprized of it before hand, and <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or was made an eye-witne&s;s of it: for he &s;aw the <HI>Chariot of fire, and the hor&s;es of fire,</HI> that came to wait upon his Ma&s;ter, and &s;aw him actually go up in a whirlwind into Heaven,

2 <HI>King.</HI> 2.3, 11. But when life &amp; immortality was to be brought to the cleare&s;t light, the Ex|ample is more according to the manner, that all the Saints &s;hall be received up to glory; for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of death, and then aro&s;e again from the dead, of which he gave many infallible proofs, being &s;een of <HI>Cephas,</HI> and of the twelve; yea, and of above five hundred at once, and then was &s;een of the Apo&s;tles actually to a&s;cend into Heaven, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.5, 6. <HI>Act.</HI> 1.9, 10. But thus much for this Digre&s;&s;ion. I now proceed to &s;how the wi&s;dom of GOD in making it the common lot and portion of the Saints to pa&s;s thro' the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death before they a&s;cend to glory. And it is an in&s;tance of wi&s;dom, in|a&s;much as,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This is but agreable to the threatning de|nounced again&s;t our fir&s;t Parents, and all their Po&s;terity, for their Sin and Apo&s;tacy from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>GOD threatned our fir&s;t Parents, with re|&s;pect unto the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, <HI>That in the day they eat thereof they &s;hould &s;urely dye,</HI> Gen. 2.7. Now as they were con&s;i|dered as the Repre&s;entatives of Mankind and acting in this capacity, when they eat the for|bidden fruit, &s;o we all became equally expo&s;ed to the threatned penalty, &amp; accordingly brought into a mortal dying &s;tate: according to what the Apo&s;tle tells us, Rom. 5.12. <HI>As by one man &s;in entred into the world, &amp; death by &s;in: and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that</HI> (or as in the Margin) <HI>in whom, all have &s;inned.</HI> And now altho' with

re&s;pect to the Saints &amp; true Believers, the &s;ting of death is taken away, and it is made a gain|ful and a happy change to them; yet GOD ob|liges them to undergo this di&s;&s;olution, that &s;o the letter of the law in the threatning may be executed &amp; thereby the Truth of GOD effectu|ally &s;ecured, even altho' it be turned to the ad|vantage of the Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. One good <HI>End an&s;wered by the death of the Saints, is the frequent manife&s;tation of the won|derful Power of divine Grace at &s;uch a time.</HI></P>
<P>There is no time &s;o trying to a Man as when Death approaches, and &s;tares him in the face and he expects in a few days or hours to leave the world, and take an everla&s;ting farewell of all things in it; to endure the agonies of death, and then to lye down in the rotting Grave, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to &s;ee corruption. But now GOD often|times takes &s;uch opportunities to di&s;cover the Power of divine Grace in the Souls of his Saints, and Servants; by enabling them at &s;uch times to &s;hew &s;uch a &s;teddy faith and hope, and con|fidence in GOD; &s;uch patience, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;ignation, &s;uch calmne&s;s, peace and joy, which nothing le&s;s than the &s;upernatual Grace of GOD is able to effect. How does the Power of di|vine Grace appear in tho&s;e Saints to whom GOD is plea&s;ed to manife&s;t him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o far, as to give them a&s;&s;urance of their future good e&s;tate, in inabling them to receive the arre&s;ts of death, not only with calmne&s;s, and compo&s;edne&s;s of mind, but with holy triumph, and joy, from the delightful pro&s;pect of being pre&s;ent with the
<PB N="383" REF="002987_0388_0FE6B33A8C3FD570">
Lord, when ab&s;ent from the body, to behold and partake of his Glory? How powerful does the Grace of GOD appear in &s;uch, who from a firm belief of the future State, of that glory, honour and immortality which they are intitled to, can in holy triumph &s;ay, as 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57. <HI>O Death where is thy &s;ting? O Grave where is thy victory? the &s;ting of death is &s;in, and the &s;trength of &s;in is the law, but thanks be to God that giveth us the victory, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Death of the Saints &s;eems requi&s;ite, in order to their laying a&s;ide their pre&s;ent Corrupti|ons, and their entring upon an Incorruptible and Immortal Sate.</HI></P>
<P>The Bodies we at pre&s;ent carry about with us, are <HI>Corruptible bodies.</HI> Now it is very nece&s;|&s;ary in order to our entring into the heavenly State, that the&s;e gro&s;s, heavy, infirm and un|active bodies &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, as being alto|gether unfit for that pure and holy place; or for tho&s;e refined, and &s;piritual Exerci&s;es and En|joyments. Now therefore GOD has wi&s;ely or|dered it that we &s;hould put off the&s;e clayie, mouldering tabernacles, in order to our receiving more glorious, and perfect ones at the Re&s;ur|ruction, even more refined and &s;piritual bodies, which will be more fit habitations for the Spi|rits of ju&s;t Men, that will be made perfect, and be no clog and hindrance to the Soul in any of its operations. And this is the account the A|po&s;tle gives of the matter, &s;peaking of the Re|&s;urrection of the dead, and of the difference be|tween the bodies they lay down, and tho&s;e they
<PB N="384" REF="002987_0389_0FE6B33A9F3D7F60">
&s;hall a&s;&s;ure at the Re&s;urrection, 1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44. <HI>It is &s;own in corruption, is is rai&s;ed in incorruption; it is &s;own in di&s;honour, it is rai&s;ed in glory; it is &s;own in weakne&s;s, it is rai&s;ed in power; it is &s;own a natural body, it is rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body.</HI> In &s;hort, the changing our vile bodies by Death is, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, for this rea&s;on, which is certainly a very &s;ufficient one, Namely, that <HI>they may be fa&s;honed like unto Chri&s;t's glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to &s;ubdue all things unto him&s;elf,</HI> Phil. 3.21.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is wi&s;dom in GOD to order Saints as well as Sinners, to pa&s;s thro' the dark valley of the &s;ha|dow of death, becau&s;e of the Inconveniency that would ari&s;e from their po&s;&s;ing out of the world after a different manner.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, if there was only this one Inconvenience in it, viz. <HI>That then every man's State with re&s;pect to another World would be certainly known, accor|ding to the manner of his pa&s;&s;ing out of the world, by those that are left behind</HI>: I &s;ay, if there was only this inconvenience, it would be &s;ufficient to &s;how the divine Prudence in ordering the &s;ame way of going out of the world both to the righ|teous, and to the wicked. If there was any difference made between Saints and Sinners in the way of their leaving the world; that is, if the righteous &s;hould be &s;o far priviledged&punc; as to e&s;cape the pangs of death, and be tran&s;lated, as <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI>; but Sinners &s;hould be &s;ubject to the &s;troke of death, then only by knowing which way a man made his Exit, by

<P>For altho' we pay &s;uppo&s;e it would afford the greate&s;t comfort to mourning Relations, to &s;ee their friends going out of the world in the way a&s;&s;igned for the righteous, becau&s;e this would give them an a&s;&s;urance that they are gone to glory and happine&s;s; yet on the other hand, how in&s;uppor|table would be the grief and the di&s;tre&s;s of ten|der Parents, e&s;pecially, when their Children &s;hould be taken from them in the way a&s;&s;igned, for the wicked, by which they would certainly know that they are lo&s;t for ever, that they are gone to Hell, to &s;uffer the vengeance of eternal Fire!</P>
<P>It is very cutting and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to have any near Relation go out of the world, That we fear is gone to the place of Hypocrites &amp; Unbelievers: but there is now generally &s;ome hope mixed with their fears; there is at lea&s;t a <HI>Who can tell but they have found mercy at the la&s;t</HI>!

<P>But Then further, what an ill improvement would be made of &s;uch a certain knowledge, with re&s;pect to every man's future &s;tate, as there would be, if there was a con&s;tant difference between Saints and Sinners, as to the manner of their de|parture hence! Then we &s;hould find &s;ome among Sinners, and gone to the place of Torments, who by their profe&s;&s;ion and outward carriage, every man reckoned among the Saints: And how would this cau&s;e the Enemies of the Lord to bla&s;pheme? And how would it prejudice them again&s;t the ways of GOD&punc; and make them &s;u&s;picious of and uncharitable towards many Chri&s;tians that are &s;incere, and upright before GOD? Then al&s;o we &s;hould perhaps &s;ee many whom we ranked with the wicked to belong to the number of the righteous, and how would this Encourage the wicked to indulge them&s;elves in tho&s;e things which tho&s;e that went before them had been guilty of, and yet found mercy. And
<PB N="387" REF="002987_0392_0FE6B347462CFA78">
many other inconveniences would ari&s;e from the certain knowledge of every man's &s;tate that are gone out of the world; and therefore GOD in wi&s;dom has hid it from us by &s;o ordering it that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, with re&s;pect to their leaving the pre|&s;ent world; &s;o that no man can know either love or hatred by the manner of his departure: for all die; as dyeth the Sinner, &s;o dyeth the Saint, as to the external cau&s;e of it. And altho' the Souls immediately upon their departure from the body go to very different places, yet this is invi&s;ible, and unknown to us that &s;urvive; and we mu&s;t wait till we get among them, if not till the Re|&s;urrection, and the Judgment, before we &s;hall cer|tainly know what is become of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Another &s;tep the Saints are to take in order to their arriving at perfect bli&s;s and happine&s;s, and in which al&s;o the wi&s;dom of GOD appears, is the Re&s;urrection of their bodies.</HI></P>
<P>The doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the body (how unknown&punc; &s;oever to the heathen world, and how incredible &s;oever it appeared to them when they fir&s;t heard of it) is neverthele&s;s a doctrine according to Truth. For we have not only the Example of Chri&s;ts own Re&s;urrection, who is head of the Church, which is his body, and every particular Believer a Member of this body, from whence we may argue their Re&s;urrection; for if the head be ri&s;en, the members will al&s;o follow: and hence Chri&s;t in his Re&s;urrection, is &s;aid to <HI>become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.20. But it is expre&s;sly taught in the word of
<PB N="388" REF="002987_0393_0FE6B347590E69D8">
GOD, and univer&s;ally believed by the People of GOD; the old-Te&s;tament Doctrine was, that <HI>Death &s;hould be &s;wallowed up in victory,</HI> I&s;ai. 25.8. And Chri&s;t in the new Te&s;tament &s;ays expre&s;sly, That <HI>the hour is coming in which all that are in their Graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall come forth, they that have done good, to the Re&s;urrection of life,</HI> Joh. 5.28, 29. Now this is wi&s;ely ordered by GOD.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e it will be a glorious Manife&s;tation of the wonderful Power of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>There was infinite Power, as well as Wi&s;dom, and Skill, di&s;played in forming our bodies at fir&s;t out of the du&s;t of the Earth; and there will be as glorious a Manife&s;tation hereof in rai&s;ing them up again at the la&s;t day; when they have been di&s;&s;olved into du&s;t and &s;cattered upon the face of the whole Earth. The doctrine of the Re&s;urrecti|on &s;eem'd incredible to the heathen world, be|cau&s;e of the difficulties that appeared in it; but the more difficult the work is, the more glorious manife&s;tation there will be of the divine Power in accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e it is very requi&s;ite for Compleating the future Glory and Happine&s;s of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>The happine&s;s of the Soul in its &s;eparate &s;tate is not the full and compleat happine&s;s of the Man; for the body is an e&s;&s;ential part of the humane Con&s;titution, and there is not a perfect Man but where Soul and Body are united, and con&s;equently not a perfect happine&s;s to the Man, but where both the e&s;&s;ential parts of his nature are &s;harers in it. Now therefore as GOD de|&s;igned
<PB N="389" REF="002987_0394_0FE6B34871921BF8">
the happine&s;s of the Saints in Heaven &s;hould be perfect and compleat; &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary that their bodies be rai&s;ed, that they might be glorified, and made happy with the Soul: and it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be rai&s;ed a &s;piritual body, that it might be more like unto the Soul, and &s;o in&s;tead of clogging or hindring, they may be helpful to each other in their operations, and enjoyments in the heavenly world.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another thing nece&s;&s;ary in order to the Saints arriving at the future Glory, (and in which there appears much of the wi&s;dom of GOD) is their Appearing before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST, to be tryed and judged, according as their works have been.</HI></P>
<P>As it is appointed for all Men once to dye, &s;o after that is the Judgment. And we are expre&s;s|ly told, That <HI>we mu&s;t all appear before the Judg|ment Seat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he done, whether it be good or bad,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.10.</P>
<P>Now here I might ob&s;erve the wi&s;dom of GOD,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the Per&s;on appointed to be the Judge of the World, Namely, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> For he is the mo&s;t &s;uitable Per&s;on that can be for that Office.</P>
<P>His par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking both of the divine &amp; the humane Natures, peculiarly qualifies him beyond any o|ther Per&s;on for Judge of the World.</P>
<P>His partaking of the divine Nature eminently qualifies him for it; as hereby he is Omni&s;cient, and &s;o can't be deceived, or impo&s;ed on: He mu&s;t needs be al&s;o infinite in Ju&s;tice, and &s;o will do right, and can do no wrong. Moreover as he
<PB N="390" REF="002987_0395_0FE6B3488AB45F28">
is GOD, he is Omnipotent, whereby he is able to execute every Sentence that he pronounceth.</P>
<P>And then his being <HI>Man,</HI> was a further quali|fication of him for a Judge among the Children of Men. His being of our own Nature a&s;&s;ures us that he is our friend, and having been touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, having been tempted in all things like as we are, we may conclude that he will make as favourable allow|ances for our Infirmities, and imperfections, as can be con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of GOD. And thus becau&s;e GOD had determined to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and becau&s;e he would have that grand affair carried on with all po&s;&s;ible fairne&s;s, and impartiality, he committed it to his Son, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us: which is the rea|&s;on that is given for it, Joh. 3.27. <HI>And hath</HI> (i. e. the Father hath) <HI>given him authority to execute Judgment, becau&s;e he is the Son of man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I might ob&s;erve the wi&s;dom of GOD <HI>in the pomp and glory with which the Son of GOD will appear to judge the World.</HI></P>
<P>When the Son of GOD appears to judge the quick and dead, he will appear in Power and great Glory; with his own Glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy Angels; which &s;eems to be a piece of honour highly nece&s;&s;ary to be con|ferred on him. For &s;ince his fir&s;t appearance was in the form of a Servant, and with all the marks of external meanne&s;s, and poverty (which indeed very well became the de&s;ign of his fir&s;t coming, which was to make reconciliation for &s;ins by bearing them in his own body on the tree:)
<PB N="391" REF="002987_0396_0FE6B353803F00E8">
So when he appears again (which will be upon another occa&s;ion, even to &s;et as the glorious Judge of the World) it is highly proper for him to appear after a different manner, even with Power and Glory, that &s;o tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected him, becau&s;e he was a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief, might &s;ee and be a|&s;hamed to con&s;ider what a glorious Per&s;on they offered &s;uch contempt unto. Moreover, this is the way to have the proce&s;s of that great and no|table day of the Lord be as it ought, very <HI>augu&s;t and &s;olemn.</HI> And then la&s;tly, this glorious appear|ance of Chri&s;t to Judgment, as it will &s;erve to terrifie and torment the wicked, &s;o it will be for the comfort and the joy of the Saints. This coming of his with his mighty Angels, as it will be to take vengeance on them that know not GOD, and that obey not his Go&s;pel; &s;o it will be to be glorifyed in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>I might al&s;o ob&s;erve, that GOD's not recei|ving the Saints to their full glory before they have pa&s;&s;ed a tryal, and have been acquitted, and ap|plauded at the bar of Chri&s;t, is wi&s;ely ordered.</HI></P>
<P>For hereby the divine Ju&s;tice &amp; Impartiality will be &s;ufficiently vindicated, even whil&s;t he re|ceives &s;ome to everla&s;ting life; and at the &s;ame time &s;ends others away into everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>When every Saint pa&s;&s;es an exact tryal at the Bar of Chri&s;t, and gives an account unto his Judge of his behaviour in the body; and when Chri&s;t proceeds with him according to the rules of the
<PB N="392" REF="002987_0397_0FE6B353932B8050">
Go&s;pel which he lived under, (for I meddle with none but &s;uch as are under the Go&s;pel) it will then very clearly appear that with righteou&s;ne&s;s he judges the world, and the people with equity. It will then appear to his immortal honour, that he who is the Judge of all the Earth will do right, and that with him is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, that he acquits none but &s;uch as according to the Go&s;|pel-Covenant are to be acquitted and di&s;charged. And that he condemns none that according to the Covenant of Grace could lay any claim unto a pardon: &s;o that Chri&s;t in going by a certain rule in Judging, without the lea&s;t bias by favour or affection will give occa&s;ion for that &s;ong of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and of the Lamb, to be &s;ung of all the Angels and Saints that are about his throne of Judgment, <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.3, 4. &mdash; <HI>Ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou king of Saints: who &s;hall not fear thee, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy.</HI></P>
<P>And thus as the Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t will be vindicated and honoured, &s;o the Saints them&s;elves by being brought to Judgment, will be vindicated from all tho&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, re|proaches and reflections that have been unju&s;tly and uncharitably ca&s;t upon them in this world: and it gives al&s;o an opportunity for the publi&s;h|ing the virtues and graces, and good deeds of the Saints to the world of Angels and Men, to their immortal honour; by which means the Saints coming to a tryal, is of un&s;peakable advantage to them, as well as great glory to GOD him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now when the Judgment is over, when every Man has received a &s;entence according as
<PB N="393" REF="002987_0398_0FE6B354E2C1FEB8">
his works have been; when the Saints have re|ceived the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you</HI>: and the wicked have received that dreadful heart-breaking &s;entence, <HI>Go, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels</HI>; and are accordingly bound hand and foot, and ca&s;t into the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, to endure that &s;trange puni&s;hment re&s;erved for the workers of iniquity; Then &s;hall the Saints a&s;cend with Chri&s;t, and all the Multitudes of the heavenly Ho&s;ts (that waited on him) into Hea|ven, and &s;hall go every one to tho&s;e Man&s;ions of Glory, which he is now preparing for them, and &s;hall there partake of &s;uch a glory and happine&s;s as eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it &s;o much as entred into the heart of man to con|ceive of: And there to continue not for a few days or years only, but throughout the infinite Ages of ETERNITY.</P>
<P>And thus I have gone thro' the whole affair of our Redemption, from the foundation to the fi|ni&s;hing &s;troke of it, and in every &s;tep hereof we have &s;een &s;o much of divine wi&s;dom &amp; prudence appearing, and manife&s;ting it &s;elf, as may well fill us all with the mo&s;t admiring &amp; adoring ap|prehen&s;ions of that GOD, who has with &s;uch un|&s;earchable and unerring wi&s;dom conducted and managed this whole affair, cau&s;ing us to break forth with the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 11.33. <HI>O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom &amp; knowledge of God!</HI></P>
<P>I purpo&s;e (GOD willing) one di&s;cour&s;e more upon the &s;ubject, which will be taken up in pious

<P><HI>And now to conclude the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us all be thankful to GOD that he has plea|&s;ed to give us &s;uch Evidences and A&s;&s;urances of the future Glory, as to leave no room to doubt about it.

<P>THE Doctrine which has been &s;o often in|&s;i&s;ted on, is, as you may remember, this:</P>
<P>Namely,</P>
<P><HI>That in the grand affair of our Redemption by JESUS CHRIST, there have been glorious Manife&s;tations of divine Wi&s;dom and Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>And for the illu&s;trating and confirming this Doctrine, I have &s;hown wherein Wi&s;dom and Prudence con&s;i&s;ts. I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn in general, that the wi&s;dom of GOD has been clearly manife&s;ted in the work of Redemption: 1. From the End that was propo&s;ed herein; Namely, the Manife&s;tation of the Glory of GOD. And then 2ly. The difficulty &amp; &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibility of accompli&s;hing this End in our Redemption. And la&s;tly, by &s;hewing how fully this grand end and de&s;ign of GOD has been accompli&s;hed in the Redemption of fallen Man through JESUS CHRIST, by the glorious Manife&s;tations there have been of all the divine perfections in this &s;tupendous work.</P>

hereby to Men, by the application of the holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from Heaven for that end, &s;ays, The&s;e are the things <HI>which the Angels de&s;ire to look into,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.12. And con&s;idering what a wonderful work of GOD this is, It is no won|der that &s;uch bright Intelligences are looking and &s;earching into it. The <HI>works of the Lord are great &s;ought out of all them that have plea&s;ure therein,</HI> P&s;al. 111.2. And what greater work than that of Redemption?

<P>When it is &s;aid, Which things the Angels <HI>de&s;ire to look into,</HI> it is ob&s;erved by Expo&s;itors, That the word &s;ignifies a bowing down the head, &amp; &s;tooping to look into a thing; it is a looking diligently and earne&s;tly: It implies, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Pool</HI>) "A prying, or looking narrowly into it", which argues great de&s;ire to know it.

<P>This Text is al&s;o ob&s;erved to have an allu&s;ion to the two Cherubims that &s;tood above the Ark, with their faces towards the Mercy-Seat, and their eyes fixed &s;teadily upon it, in and under which are concealed all the glorious My&s;teries
<PB N="399" REF="002987_0404_0FE6B3D3C11F9900">
of our Redemption: For in the Ark was the law of GOD which we had broken, and &s;o had ex|po&s;ed our &s;elves to all tho&s;e Cur&s;es that are de|nounced again&s;t every one that continues not in all things that are written in the Book of the law to do them; which &s;erved to repre&s;ent the condition of Man in his fallen &s;tate without a Saviour, in which &s;tate he was expo&s;ed to the wrath of GOD, and the penalties of his broken law, which were death and damna|tion: but now over or upon this law was the Mercy-Seat, which repre&s;ented that notwith|&s;tanding the law was broken, and according to the tenor of it there was no Mercy to be had, yet &s;ome how or other the law &s;hould be &s;atisfied, and we &s;hould obtain Mercy. In &s;hort, here was a repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t, who having fulfilled the law, and fatisfied the de|mands of it by his Obedience and Death, he has erected a throne of Grace, and prepared <HI>a mercy-Seat</HI> for us to repair unto. And the Cherubims turning their eyes down upon the Mercy-Seat, are only a repre&s;entation of the Angels, who are actually looking with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s upon the wonderful contrivance of Man's Re|demption. When Man had &s;inned, they doubt|le&s;s thought their ca&s;e as de&s;perate as that of the fallen Angels; all their wi&s;dom and &s;aga|city could not think of a way how GOD could maintain the harmony of his perfections in our recovery.

<P>Wi&s;dom is &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing excellency, and perfection of a rational Being, that it de|mands honour and re&s;pect wherever it is found.

prudence in the work of Man's Redemption, than is po&s;&s;ible for Men or Angels to conceive of, much le&s;s to exerci&s;e and manife&s;t them&s;elves; &s;o there is infinitely more e&s;teem and honour, and reverence due to him, than there can be to the brighte&s;t Man or Angel. We &s;hould admire and adore him for all his great and marvelous works, becau&s;e in wi&s;dom has he done them all; but e&s;pecially for the a&s;toni&s;hing work of our Re|demption, <HI>in which he has &s;o abounded towards us in all wi&s;dom and prudence.</HI> We &s;hould think of him, and behave our &s;elves towards him, with a profound reverence, as the <HI>only wi&s;e God.</HI> We mu&s;t honour him in our <HI>hearts</HI> above every other Being; con&s;idering that his <HI>thoughts are a great deep</HI>; and that he is <HI>wonderful in coun&s;el,</HI> as well as <HI>excellent in working.</HI> Neither may we <HI>&s;peak</HI> of him without the greate&s;t reverence; and as for our whole carriage and behaviour towards him, it mu&s;t be &s;uch as is due to a GOD, that is wi&s;e in heart, &amp; mighty in &s;trength. Verily we &s;hould all, with the holy Angels, &s;tand amazed at this wonderful contrivance of our Redemption; and whil&s;t we are filled with joy and prai&s;e, for the un&s;peakable Mercy that we receive hereby, we al&s;o &s;hould be filled with no le&s;s fear and re|verence, for the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom and contri|vance there has appeared in it; and the language of our Souls &s;hould be that, in Rom. 16 27. <HI>To God only wi&s;e, be glory thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Here is enough to &s;atisfie us, that however dark and unaccountable any of the ways of GOD
<PB N="402" REF="002987_0407_0FE6B3D51C051880">
may be to us; yet that they are conducted, and governed by infinite and unerring wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>If, as the Preacher tells us, Prov. 23.3. <HI>The hearts of kings,</HI> that is of earthly kings, <HI>are un|&s;earchable</HI>; infinitely more &s;o is the heart of <HI>him, who is the king Eternal, Immortal, Invi&s;ible, and the only wi&s;e God. Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God? Can&s;t thou find out the Almighty to per|fection</HI>? Job 11.7. <HI>For ha&s;t thou not known? hast thou not heard, concerning the everlasting GOD the LORD the Creator of the ends of the earth; that there is no &s;earching of his under&s;tanding</HI>? I&s;ai. 40.28. And no wonder there is no &s;ear|ching of his under&s;tanding, <HI>for as our Lord is great, and of great power,</HI> &s;o <HI>his under&s;tanding is infinite,</HI> P&s;al. 147.5. GOD's ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts; for as the heavens are higher than the earth, &s;o are his ways than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts. And therefore, altho' &s;ome of the ways of GOD are dark and my&s;terious to us, and we can give no account of them, nor what de&s;igns are an&s;wered by &s;uch a particular way of ma|nagement; yet what we have &s;een of the won|derful wi&s;dom of GOD in other of his works, e&s;pecially in that of Redemption, &s;hould &s;et us down fully &s;atisfied, that in wi&s;dom he performs them all; and that it is owing only to the nar|rowne&s;s, and &s;hortne&s;s of our thoughts, that we don't &s;ee the wi&s;dom of GOD in the&s;e, as well as in other of his works. And therefore as to tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD that we can't &s;ee thro', we mu&s;t be far from calling in que&s;tion the wi&s;dom
<PB N="403" REF="002987_0408_0FE6B3E301A40758">
of GOD in them, but mu&s;t attribute it to our own ignorance. Here I might mention a few of the ways of GOD which &s;eem dark and unaccounta|ble to us, and yet we mu&s;t believe are all ordered with con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and prudence.</P>
<P>Thus for in&s;tance,</P>
<P><HI>Who can give any account why GOD hated</HI> E&s;au <HI>the Elder, and loved</HI> Jacob <HI>the Younger Bro|ther, and that whil&s;t they were in the womb, and before either of them had done good or evil</HI>?</P>
<P>That it was &s;o, appears by comparing, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25.23. <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.2. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.11, 12, 13. together.</P>
<P>We can't &s;ee why they might not both have been beloved, and accepted as well as one; or if there mu&s;t be but one we can't &s;ee why <HI>E&s;au</HI> and his Po&s;terity might not have been accepted, and <HI>Jacob</HI> been rejected. Now the whole account we can give of this matter is, That GOD herein di&s;|plays his &s;overeignty; and if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his chu&s;ing one and rejecting the other; yet it can be no rea&s;on why he cho&s;e <HI>Jacob</HI> and rejected <HI>E&s;au.</HI> But now altho' we can a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for it, yet when we con&s;ider with what wi&s;dom and prudence he acts in other things, we may be &s;ure he did in this, and that he &s;aw rea&s;on &s;ufficient for rejecting the Elder, and choo&s;ing the Younger, altho' it don't appear at pre&s;ent unto us.</P>
<P>So again, <HI>Who can give any rea&s;on why</HI> Jacob <HI>&s;hould come at the ble&s;&s;ing by fal&s;ehood, and lying, as he did?</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Gen.</HI> 27. <HI>ch.</HI> we find that in order to his getting the ble&s;&s;ing from his elder Brother, he
<PB N="404" REF="002987_0409_0FE6B3E3147F5080">
told a direct and po&s;itive lye to his Father, &s;ay|ing, That <HI>he was E&s;au his fir&s;t-born,</HI> v. 19. <HI>His very &s;on E&s;au,</HI> v. 24. upon which <HI>I&s;aac</HI> ble&s;&s;ed him, and GOD confirmed the ble&s;&s;ing to him. But now who can give any account why the ble&s;|&s;ing &s;hould be brought about after &s;uch a manner, by lying, and deceit, and not in an hone&s;t way? E&s;pecially con&s;idering that GOD <HI>is a GOD of Truth,</HI> and that <HI>lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.</HI> Why did not GOD who has the hearts of all in his hands &s;ecretly turn the heart of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to his Son <HI>Jacob</HI>? or why did he not let him know that <HI>Jacob</HI> was the per&s;on that he intended to confer the ble&s;&s;ing on? as he told <HI>Abraham,</HI> That not in <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> but in <HI>I&s;aac</HI> his Seed &s;hould be called? But now, altho' we can't give an ac|count of this matter, yet we may be &s;ure that GOD can: and that in this as well in other affairs he has acted wi&s;ely, and that &s;ome good ends or other are an&s;wered by it.</P>
<P>Again, Who can give the rea&s;on why the Son of GOD <HI>took not on him the nature of Angels, but the Seed of Abraham?</HI></P>
<P>Why did GOD pa&s;s by the Angel that re|volted from him, re&s;erving them in everla&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s to the judgment of the great Day, when he had pity on the fallen race of Adam? But now altho' we can &s;ee nothing but that the glory of GOD might have been as much advanced, if he had acted quite otherwi&s;e; yet con&s;idering the wonderful di&s;plays of wi&s;|dom in the Redemption that is wrought out for Man, we may be &s;ure it was wi&s;ely projected by
<PB N="405" REF="002987_0410_0FE6B3E4493C9020">
GOD to make choice of fallen Men, rather than fallen Angels, to make them the Monuments of his free, and &s;overeign Mercy.</P>
<P>So again, It is unaccountable to us that &s;o great a part of the world <HI>lies in Ignorance, and are peri&s;hing for lack of wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>Since Chri&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Heb. 2.9. <HI>Ta&s;ted death for every man</HI>; and is &s;aid to be <HI>the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the whole world,</HI> 1 Joh. 2 2. and &s;ince his &s;ufferings were infinitely meritorious, and his blood of &s;ufficient value to wa&s;h away the guilt of the whole world; and &s;ince it is declared, as in 2 Pet. 3.9. <HI>That God is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance</HI>: I &s;ay, con&s;idering the&s;e things, it &s;eems &s;trange and unaccountable to us, that the greate&s;t part of the world by far are entirely de&s;titute of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and have not &s;o much as heard of a Saviour. Since there is merit enough in Chri&s;t, for the pardon and &s;alvation of all, and &s;ince there is &s;o much glory to GOD, and joy in Heaven at the Conver&s;ion of every Sinner, why are there not more Converted and Saved, yea, why &s;hould not every knee in earth as well as in Heaven bow at the Name of JESUS, and every tongue confe&s;s him to be LORD, to the Glory of GOD the Father? Or at lea&s;t why have they not the opportunity to come to the knowledge of the&s;e things, and the offers thereof made unto them? Now altho' it may be beyond our skill to give an an&s;wer to the&s;e things; yet when we con&s;ider with how much wi&s;dom our Redemption has been
<PB N="406" REF="002987_0411_0FE6B3E45EA72B00">
carried on, we cannot in the lea&s;t doubt but that GOD has &s;ome very good rea&s;ons for &s;uffering &s;o great a part of the world to lie in Ignorance.</P>
<P>And to add no more, What account can we give for the death of &s;uch Multitudes in their In|fancy? That GOD &s;hould &s;o immediately de|&s;troy the works of his own hands, without giving the lea&s;t opportunity for the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e no|ble Powers, with which he endowed them? But GOD managing other things with &s;uch wi&s;dom, may a&s;&s;ure us, that he has very good rea&s;on for this.</P>
<P>And &s;o there are many other things, which how dark and my&s;terious &s;oever they appear to us, yet we may be &s;ure that GOD acts with con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom in them all. And altho' we can't tell the rea&s;on of &s;uch a conduct now; yet we &s;hall, if we are the Children of GOD &s;ome time or other come to &s;uch a knowledge of them, as will afford wonderful &s;atisfaction to us. As our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;aid to <HI>Peter,</HI> upon his asking with wonder, why he wa&s;h'd his Di&s;ciples feet, <HI>Saying, What I do, thou knowe&s;t not now, but thou &s;halt know hereafter.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>How ought we to Acquie&s;ce, and re&s;t fully &s;atisfied with every di&s;pen&s;ation of divine Provi|dence towards us?</HI></P>
<P>Some of GOD's dealings with us are very dark and my&s;terious, e&s;pcially many of the af|flictive di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence that he exerci&s;es us withal; &s;o that many of the Chil|dren of GOD are ready to &s;ay unto GOD with Job, <HI>Job</HI> 10.2. <HI>Shew me wherefore thou contende&s;t
<PB N="407" REF="002987_0412_0FE6B3EBE2AB2AF8">
with me.</HI> But now, in&s;tead of being impatient, or di&s;contented; in&s;tead of murmuring, and complaining, we &s;hould (from the manife&s;tations GOD has made of his wi&s;dom in the work of our Redemption) &s;et down &s;atisfied with all the al|lotments of divine Providence, realizing this to our &s;elves that GOD governs every thing in in|finite and unerring wi&s;dom; that he knows in|finitely better than we do what is be&s;t for us: and that he has done, and always will do that which is for the be&s;t; and that he can never err, or be mi&s;taken in any of his managements. We mu&s;t believe that GOD never took one wrong &s;tep in the whole cour&s;e of his Providence, and that he never will or can; and this &s;hould q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iet us in all our times of trouble and darkne&s;s. Are we in poor and low circum&s;tances? Do we meet with lo&s;&s;es &amp; cro&s;&s;es, and di&s;appointments? Do we lo&s;e our friends, our e&s;tates, our good names, our health, and ea&s;e, and the comforts of life? And do we lo&s;e the light of GOD's coun|tenance, which is more than all the re&s;t? We mu&s;t be quiet, not a murmuring word may pro|ceed out of our mouths, nor an impatient thought be harbored in our hearts: but we &s;hould con&s;i|der after this manner, That if GOD in the affair of our Redemption has managed with &s;uch con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom, as we have heard, &s;urely be knows how to order our circum&s;tances in the world. And indeed, for us to find fault with any of the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, is to deny the divine wi&s;dom, and to &s;et up our own above it.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="408" REF="002987_0413_0FE6B3EBF5661310">5. <HI>We learn where to go for wi&s;dom and pru|dence, to direct us in all our affairs.</HI></P>
<P>Surely, that GOD that has managed the affair of our Redemption, with &s;o much wi&s;dom and prudence, can enable us to manage all our affairs with di&s;cretion. He mu&s;t needs be the infinitely wi&s;e GOD, and the fountain of all wi&s;dom, that managed that affair: and now to whom &s;hould we go but unto him? Surely, we ought to apply our &s;elves to him to be guided, and directed in all our affairs. We are commanded <HI>to acknow|ledge him in all our ways</HI>; and we are encouraged by his gracious promi&s;e <HI>of directing our paths for us,</HI> Prov. 3.6. And there is a further Invitation, and Command given us from the &s;acred Oracles, Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and up|raideth not, and it &s;hall be given him.</HI> Here then <HI>let us cea&s;e from our own wi&s;dom,</HI> and acknow|ledge, and adore the divine wi&s;dom, by tru&s;ting in the LORD with all our hearts, and not lean to our own under&s;tanding; but at all times, and in all ca&s;es, let us &s;eek to him for guidance and direction. This we mu&s;t do in all the ordinary and common affairs of life: but e&s;pecially &s;hould we &s;eek for divine direction in all weighty, doubtful and perplexed ca&s;es. We mu&s;t look upon him as he is, <HI>The wonderful Coun&s;ellour,</HI> and that no ca&s;e is too difficult for him to direct, or advi&s;e us in. For &s;urely there never was a ca&s;e &s;o difficult, and perplexed, as that of our Redemption: and therefore he that could ma|nage that &s;o thorowly, and compleatly without
<PB N="409" REF="002987_0414_0FE6B3EE5E5292C0">
any error or mi&s;take in the lea&s;t article, can never be pos'd or puzzled in any ca&s;e what&s;o|ever. Verily the mo&s;t dark, and intricate ca&s;es are as plain to him as any. He is never at a &s;tand to know what is be&s;t to be done. Now to this <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> we ought to &s;eek, and upon him we ought to wait, for all the wi&s;dom that is profitable, and nece&s;&s;ary to direct; and if he un|dertake for us, we may be &s;ure of being led in the right way; for as he cannot be deceived, &s;o neither will he deceive or fail them that put their tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Since there has been &s;uch glorious di&s;plays of divine Wi&s;dom in our Redemption; What inexcu|&s;able Folly and Wickedne&s;s are &s;uch guilty of, as refu&s;e to accept of this Redemption, as it is offered to them?</HI></P>
<P>Has infinite wi&s;dom been exerci&s;ed, not only in the manner of purcha&s;ing, but of applying this Redemption, and in the terms on which it is propounded, and offered unto us? Surely then we practically deny the wi&s;dom of GOD in this offer, whil&s;t we wilfully refu&s;e to accept of pardon, and &s;alvation, as it is offered unto us. And now how vile, and wretched, and what pride and ignorance is it, for any of us to deny the wi&s;dom of GOD in our Redemption? as every one does, that won't accept of Salvation upon the terms that it is offered unto him in the Go&s;pel. Surely the matter was wi&s;ely concerted, and we may &s;afely &s;ay, That Salvation could not have been brought about in a better way; it could not have been purcha&s;ed, nor could it have been
<PB N="410" REF="002987_0415_0FE6B3EE73AB43B0">
offered on better terms. Now then how inexcu|&s;able are they that find fault with the way of Man's Salvation! What indignity and affront is this to GOD, for &s;uch worms of the du&s;t as we, we who are but of ye&s;terday, and know nothing, to &s;et our carnal rea&s;oning up again&s;t the wi&s;dom of GOD, as if we could have found out a better way for Salvation, than what infinite wi&s;dom has pitched upon! CHRIST Crucified was to the Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Greeks fool|i&s;hne&s;s; and &s;o he is to carnal Unbelieving hearts: But to them that Believe, CHRIST appears to be the wi&s;dom of GOD, and the power of GOD; and at length mu&s;t appear &s;o to the Wicked and Unbelieving, either in this world by their Conver&s;ion, or in the world to come to their Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>We ought to be Studying and Searching more and more into the Wi&s;dom of GOD, in this grand Affair.</HI></P>
<P>The more we &s;earch into this wonderful work of GOD, the more we &s;hall di&s;cover of the riches of divine wi&s;dom therein. And the further we trace the foot-&s;teps of divine wi&s;dom, the more we &s;hall be led to admire and adore that infinite Being, that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this glorious excellency and perfection. Therefore if we would have more inlarged thoughts of GOD, of his wi&s;dom, as well as of all other perfections of the divine Nature, we mu&s;t he &s;earching yet further and further into this glorious and a&s;toni&s;hing work of our Redemption. Here are &s;uch My&s;teries of

wi&s;dom as well as &s;uch riches of love and grace as are un&s;earchable; we cannot by &s;earching find out GOD, we can never find out his wi&s;|dom in this work unto perfection. Neverthe|le&s;s, the more we &s;tudy and &s;earch into the&s;e things, the more will the&s;e My&s;teries of wi&s;|dom open unto us: and the more inlarged will our thoughts be of GOD him&s;elf, and the high|e&s;t reverence and regard to him will be excited in us. Therefore this &s;hould be the main &s;ub|ject of our &s;tudies, and of our deepe&s;t Medita|tions; our Time &s;hould be very much taken up in a &s;erious and devout Contemplation here|upon. A few cur&s;ory thoughts upon this won|derful work won't an&s;wer the end; they won't inlarge our Minds, nor influence our Hearts. It is when we &s;et our &s;elves to mu&s;e on the&s;e things, and when our hearts have dwelt &s;ome time upon this matter, that the fire burns with|in us. The Apo&s;tle found &s;o much of the be|nefit and advantage of it, that he <HI>counted all things but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Je&s;us Christ his Lord,</HI> Phil. 3.8. And he was &s;o fully per&s;waded of the u&s;efulne&s;s of it, that he determined to know nothing, or preach no|thing among the Corinthians, but JESUS CHRIST <HI>and him Crucified,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.2.</P>
<P>The Angels have looked further into the&s;e things than we, and this has filled them with more admiring and adoring apprehen&s;ions, and keeps them in &s;uch con&s;tant po&s;tures of prai&s;e, giving ble&s;&s;ing and honour, and glory, and power
<PB N="412" REF="002987_0417_0FE6B3FC5C45A008">
to him that &s;itteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever. And &s;o &s;hould we, if we had but &s;een as far into the&s;e glorious My&s;teries as they.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="8">8ly. and la&s;tly, <HI>How &s;hould we long to get to Heaven, to &s;ee, and celebrate more and more the glories of divine Wi&s;dom, in this wonderful work</HI>?</P>
<P>Whil&s;t in the pre&s;ent State, it is but a &s;mall part that we can know of it, and what we do &s;ee, is darkly &amp; very imperfectly. Our Minds are too much darkned, weakned and contracted by the remains of Sin and Corruption, to have a clear, and full di&s;cerning of this admirable Contrivance. Whil&s;t in this world we are in our Child-hood, and we think as Children, and &s;peak as Children, with re&s;pect to the glorious My&s;teries of our Redemption. But when we &s;hall arrive at the heavenly world, where that eternal Redemption, which was purcha&s;ed for us, &s;hall be perfected in us, we &s;hall have an infinitely more inlarged thought, than we can have at pre&s;ent, of this affair. Then the&s;e un&s;earchable depths of divine wi&s;dom will open them&s;elves to us; then the whole Contrivance will be unravel'd, and tho&s;e things that are dark and unaccountable to us at pre&s;ent will be cleared up to us, to our un&s;peakable joy and &s;atisfaction. Then tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of di|vine Providence, which are very dark to us at

pre&s;ent, will appear to have been ordered in the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t manner that could be. And in &s;hort, we &s;hall then &s;ee that all the Me|thods that GOD has taken with us in every &s;tep and &s;tage of our lives, have been managed with con&s;ummate Prudence: which will fill us with adoring Apprehen&s;ions of him; and not only incline, but inlarge our Souls, to celebrate the glories of his Wi&s;dom, and of his Grace for ever.</P>
<P>And now how &s;hould we de&s;ire, and long to be brought to that glorious Place, where the foot-&s;teps of divine wi&s;dom will be made &s;o Manife&s;t and Con&s;picuous? And how earne&s;t|ly &s;hould we de&s;ire to be of that ble&s;&s;ed Num|ber, on whom the divine wi&s;dom will be exer|ci&s;ed, and by whom it will be magnified and adored? How &s;hould we rejoyce to think of going to joyn tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Companies of glo|rious Angels, that are with the greate&s;t earne&s;t|ne&s;s and inten&s;ne&s;s looking into the&s;e things; and who have gone &s;o far into them, as to be able to inform us of many wonders of wi&s;dom, and grace, that we never imagined or thought of before?</P>
<P>But now, if ever we would obtain a Man&s;ion in that ble&s;&s;ed Place, where there are &s;uch Ma|nife&s;tations of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST, we mu&s;t now be complying with the Terms of Salvation, as they
<PB N="414" REF="002987_0419_0FE6B3FDB9C31048">
are offered to us in the Go&s;pel. We mu&s;t believe that the Go&s;pel-way to Salvation is the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t way that could be; and mu&s;t with all thankfulne&s;s accept the gracious offers, and invitations that are made to us there|in. We mu&s;t now believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and accept Him as our only Saviour; we mu&s;t put our &s;elves over into his hands, to be ju&s;tify'd and &s;anctify'd, to be guided and governed, to be protected and up|held, and to be eternally &s;aved by him; depend|ing upon him, to perform all things for us.</P>
<P>And then he that has abounded in wi&s;dom, as well as grace, in purcha&s;ing Redemption for us, will al&s;o in Applying the &s;ame unto us. He will then make u&s;e of the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t Means, not only to bring us into a &s;tate of Grace, but to carry us on therein from one &s;tep to another, till he bring us to the perfection of it. In a word, He will then guide us with his pru|dent, and unerring <HI>Coun&s;el, till he receives us up to Glory: Where we &s;hall plainly &s;ee the Wi&s;dom of GOD, that is now in a My&s;tery, even the hidden Wi&s;dom, which GOD ordained before the World, unto our Glory.</HI></P>
