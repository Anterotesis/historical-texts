<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Piece of Medical Hi&s;tory does natu|rally addre&s;s it &s;elf to you, con&s;idering that I have the plea&s;ure of being one of your number, that you have been fellow labourers in the management of this di&s;temper, and therefore competent judges of this performance, and that where difficult or extraordinary Ca&s;es have oc|curred in any of your private practice, I was favoured to vi&s;it the Patients in order to make a minute clinical enquiry: in &s;hort, without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance this piece would have been le&s;s perfect, and not &s;o well vouched.</P>
<P>As this di&s;temper continues to &s;pread and pre|vail in &s;everal Towns of this and the neighbour|ing Provinces, I thought it might prove a piece of humanity and benevolence, if after many months diligent ob&s;ervations made in mo&s;t of the varieties which occur in this Illne&s;s, I did en|deavour to reduce them to &s;ome ea&s;y di&s;tinct Hi&s;torical and Practical Method. The vanity of appearing as an Author or writer was no in|ducement, becau&s;e we all know that in a planta|tion life neither honour nor credit are to be acquired by writing. It is not publi&s;hed by way
<PB N="ii" REF="004012_0004_10036506CF03EAF8">of a Quack bill to procure Patients and their money, as has been the practice of &s;ome void of mode&s;ty and truth; becau&s;e the Di&s;temper is al|mo&s;t over in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and while it prevailed here I could not well have attended more pati|ents than what I had from time to time under my care, and make with attention the proper ob&s;ervations at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>A &s;econdary rea&s;on for my writing is, to induce &s;ome Gentlemen of the profe&s;&s;ion in our other Provinces and Colonies, where this di&s;temper does or may prevail; to give &s;ome account of its appearance with them, in order to di&s;cover what influence, progre&s;s of time, varieties of climate and Soil may have in the phoenomina of this di&s;ea&s;e. This method, of taking things originally that is from the life, if pur&s;ued (but by abler hands) in the Epidemical Di&s;tempers which may from time to time happen among&s;t us, may be of con&s;iderable advantage in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>A Speculation that is a novelle might have been compo&s;ed &s;ooner, but not a real Hi&s;tory: for as among&s;t Naturali&s;ts, many repeated ob&s;er|vations and experiments are requi&s;ite to form e&s;tabli&s;hed truths or conclu&s;ions; &s;o it ought cer|tainly to be in the practice of Medicine, where no affair of Speculation or curio&s;ity, but the life and death of a fellow Citizen is the object of our enquiry.</P>

<HEAD>The Practical Hi&s;tory of a new Epidemical <HI>Miliary Fever</HI> with an <HI>Angina &V;lcu&s;culo&s;a.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Di&s;temper did emerge 20th. <HI>May,</HI> 1735. in <HI>King&s;ton</HI> Town&s;hip 50 Miles Ea&s;tward from <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> it was no foreign importation, <HI>King&s;ton</HI> being an inland place, of no Trade or con&s;iderable communication. The fir&s;t &s;eized was a <HI>child who died in three Days Illne&s;s;</HI> about a Week thereafter in another Family at four Miles di&s;tance, three Children were &s;eized &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, and died al&s;o the third Day; it continues &s;preading gradually in that Town&s;hip, &s;eizing here and there particular Families with that degree of violence, that <HI>of the fir&s;t circiter forty decumbents none recovered</HI> as we were informed. It was vulgarly called the <HI>Throat Illne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>a Plague in the Throat,</HI> and alarmed the Provinces of <HI>New-England</HI> very much. Some died of a &s;udden or acute <HI>Necro&s;is;</HI> but mo&s;t of them by a <HI>Symptomatick affiction of the Fauces or Neck;</HI> that is by <HI>Sphacelations</HI> or corro&s;ive <HI>&V;lcerations</HI> in the <HI>Fauces,</HI> or by <HI>an infiltration and tumefaction</HI> in the Chops and fore part of the Neck, &s;o turged, as to bring all upon a level between the <HI>chin</HI> and <HI>&s;ternum,</HI> occa&s;ioning a <HI>&s;trangulation</HI> of the Patient in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>After a few Weeks it &s;preads into the neigh|bouring Town&s;hips, but with more mildne&s;s. The
<PB N="2" REF="004012_0006_1003650D80396F20">fir&s;t <HI>appearance</HI> that we can recollect of it in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> was 20th <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> on a Child of Capt. <HI>Stannys</HI> at the North End; having <HI>white &s;pecks</HI> in the Throat, and a <HI>cutaneous efflore&s;cence:</HI> A few more in the &s;ame Neighbourhood were &s;eized in like manner, about the &s;ame time. Towards the end of <HI>Septem|ber</HI> it appeared in &s;everal parts of the Town, with a complaint of <HI>&s;orene&s;s in the Throat, Ton&s;ils, &s;welled and &s;peckt, Uvula relaxed, &s;light Fever, flu&s;h in the Face, and an Ery&s;ipelas like efflore&s;cence on the neck, che&s;t and extremities;</HI> but being of no fatal or bad con&s;equence, nothing more than a common cold was &s;u&s;pected. Our fir&s;t alarm was from a young Man <HI>How</HI> Aet. 20. in the beginning of <HI>October:</HI> His <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> runs thus; He was lately arrived from <HI>Exeter</HI> to the Ea&s;tward, where his Brother died of this Illne&s;s; his <HI>Symptoms</HI> were great pro&s;tration of Strength, a &s;peck in one of the <HI>Ton&s;ils,</HI> colliquative <HI>Sweats, Pul&s;e</HI> not high and full, but low, hard, &s;tringy, unequal and more frequent than natural, <HI>deglutition</HI> good to the la&s;t, no <HI>Sphacelation</HI> in the Throat, no eruption; from a ra&s;h incon&s;iderate opinion of forcibly quelling the <HI>Malignity,</HI> he was thrice let Blood, had &s;ome Emeticks and Cathar|ticks admin&s;tred, and <HI>by profu&s;e evacuations was gra|dually reduced, &s;o as to die of a gentle decay of natural Strength,</HI> the 6th Day of Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>Beginning of <HI>November</HI> it &s;pread con&s;iderably in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> e&s;pecially among&s;t <HI>Children,</HI> with more vio|lent Symptoms, and &s;everals die of it in various Periods: it &s;eemed to be at the hight, as to Num|bers ailing and quantity of Deaths, the &s;econd Week of <HI>March;</HI> that Week there were 24 Buri|als, whereas <HI>communibus annis</HI> in that Sea&s;on they are only 9 or 10 <HI>per</HI> Week.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004012_0007_100386AA58729B20">
It is generally in &s;o con&s;iderable a Degree <HI>more favourable in Bo&s;ton,</HI> than in the Town&s;hips where it fir&s;t prevailed; that many can &s;carce be per&s;uad|ed of its being the &s;ame Di&s;temper: It is neverthe|le&s;s e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, there is no Symptom, even the mo&s;t malignant that has appeared in <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> but what the like has occured in <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Perhaps <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> dry healthy air, good feeding, con|&s;titutions le&s;s <HI>P&s;orick,</HI> and the better management of the Sick, favoured us; the rea&s;ons for its proving more mortal in the other Towns, may be, the Country woodland and fre&s;h water damps, (the <HI>Sheep</HI> in fenny lands are mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of and &s;uffer mo&s;t by the <HI>Rot)</HI> their coar&s;e Food, &s;alt Pork diet, <HI>P&s;orick</HI> Con&s;titutions, (which is one of the principal <HI>Endemial di&s;temperatures in New-Eng|land)</HI> bad Lodgings, and that <HI>mi&s;chievous Practice</HI> of u&s;ing this Di&s;temper with profu&s;e evacuations, whereby the laudable and &s;alutary <HI>cuticular</HI> erupti|on has been &s;o perverted as to be noticeable only in a few, and in the&s;e it was called a <HI>Scarlet Fever;</HI> the great pro&s;tration of Strength e&s;&s;ential to this Di&s;temper is &s;o much increa&s;ed, as to render <HI>Na|ture</HI> an under match for the a&s;&s;aults of this Illne&s;s and its con&s;equences. In fact to the Ea&s;tward in &s;ome Country Towns, at certain times have died 1 in 3 of the Sick, in others 1 in 4, in &s;carce any fewer than 1 in 6, whereas in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> not above 1 in 35 have died.</P>
<P>As in mo&s;t <HI>Epidemical</HI> acute Illne&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially <HI>eruptive Fevers,</HI> (witne&s;s the <HI>Small Pox</HI>) &s;o in this, are very many varities or degrees, from the mo&s;t gentle and <HI>benign</HI> to the mo&s;t <HI>malignant. Symptoms</HI> did vary chiefly from &s;omething in&s;crutable in the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> of Families and Per&s;ons; the <HI>Scropho|lous and P&s;orick</HI> were the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of it, and

The Tongue from the beginning is fur'd as in a <HI>Mercurial ptyali&s;m,</HI> urine high coloured, Blood by U.

The <HI>alvine excrement</HI> is of a dark ca&s;t and very fetid.</P>
<P>This Standard kind when left to nature, with a warm &s;oft <HI>Regimen,</HI> had generally an ea&s;y and &s;a|lutary cour&s;e in &s;ix or &s;even Days; but when by a hot cordial method, or on the other extreme, by being too much expo&s;ed to the cold, or by officious <HI>profu&s;e evacuations</HI> Nature was difturbed in her Work; the Di&s;temper was protracted, or &s;ome con|&s;equential ails from an imperfect defecation en|n|&s;ued.</P>
<P>Where Nature required any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the prin|cipal <HI>intentions</HI> were with regard to the cuticular eruption and the <HI>ulcu&s;cula</HI> in the Throat. Any Af|fection of the Throat does frequently produce a natural <HI>ptyali&s;m: Mercurials</HI> u&s;ed with di&s;cretion are a kind of &s;pecifick in &s;uch like ulcers &amp; <HI>ulcu&s;cula,</HI> and in fact here they moi&s;tned the Throat and Mouth, &s;topt the &s;preading of the <HI>ulcu&s;cula,</HI> and promoted the ca&s;ting off of the &s;loughs; and as an acce&s;&s;ory advantage (the Patients being mo&s;tly Children) <HI>de&s;troy'd Worms:</HI> among&s;t all its pre|parations <HI>Calomel</HI> an&s;wered be&s;t, the gentle vomit|ing or few &s;tools that it occa&s;ioned in &s;ome, did not confound the natural cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper: <HI>Turbith</HI> proves generally too &s;trong a revul&s;ion, and the Eruption is thereby too much diverted; this
<PB N="6" REF="004012_0010_1003643AD7F8F298">Di&s;temper did not well bear any other evacuations but <HI>Mercurials.</HI> Any detergent <HI>Gargle,</HI> with an addition of the <HI>Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes,</HI> was of good u&s;e, e&s;pecially for the <HI>Vlcu&s;cula,</HI> and did promote the di&s;charge of a ropy Phlegm lodged in the <HI>Fauces.</HI> As to the <HI>cuticular efflore&s;cence,</HI> it was not a &s;carlet <HI>&s;uffu&s;ion,</HI> but a <HI>miliary</HI> palpable erupti|on, or in lieu thereof in &s;ome con&s;titutions a con|tinued gentle breathing <HI>Sweat;</HI> and in a very few, who have naturally a <HI>liberior tran&s;it us</HI> by the <HI>Pores</HI> than is u&s;ual, no &s;en&s;ible cuticular excretion; in all the morbid <HI>effluvia</HI> di&s;covered them&s;elves by their peculiar &s;mell: The&s;e were with good effect &s;olli|cited by <HI>Snake-root Tea;</HI> or (as in &s;ome Per&s;ons) where this did occa&s;ion an <HI>ardor</HI> or burning heat, in&s;tead of a breathing mellow Sweat, <HI>Sp.

When the Eruption began to decline a few <HI>loo&s;e Stools</HI> were very refre&s;hing. The Pati|ent being up, and having recovered a competent degree of Strength, is <HI>to be purged</HI> once or twice, to carry off any feculency that may have remained in the Blood and Juices.</P>
<P>For a more di&s;tinct conception of the <HI>varities in this Di&s;temper,</HI> they may be reduced to three <HI>Cla&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Tho&s;e who die the fir&s;t, &s;econd and third day of Illne&s;s, by an irremediable <HI>Necro&s;is of the Oeco|nomy:</HI> in &s;uch the Seizure is generally &s;udden, a &s;inking pain at the Stomach, an extreme pro&s;tra|tion of Strength, a titubating low pul&s;e, in &s;ome a &s;tupor, in others a delirium, in &s;ome children

<P N="2">II.

Some by peculiarity of con&s;titution, and from im|proper admini&s;trations do die or have an incipicent recovery &s;ooner: others for the like rea&s;ons or &s;ome particular accidents (u. g. if about the time of regular <HI>mon&s;truation,</HI> the complicated fret occa&s;i|ons wor&s;e Symtoms, and of longer continuance) have this period protracted and in &s;uch (where death is inevitable) the Symptoms of death may continue a day or two longer, that is the Patient may die the eighth or ninth day.

Where the Brain is af|fected as in <HI>Vigiliae, jactantia, delirium, Coma, &s;tupor,</HI> &amp;c; gly&s;ters, Ve&s;icatories &amp; <HI>&s;uppedanea</HI> are to be u&s;ed. Where faintne&s;s or great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, give toa&s;ted Bread &s;oaked in &s;ome gene|rous Wine and Water, or volatile Spirits in their common drinks; <HI>Bezoars, Te&s;tacea</HI> and the like are of no u&s;e, the Shop <HI>Cordial Juleps</HI> and mixtures are only &s;ugar'd drams. To enumerate all the other accidental Symptoms which do happen here, in common with other acute di&s;ea&s;es, would be trifling.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Con&s;equential ails,</HI> which may be enumerated as in the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The natural Effects of an inten&s;e corro&s;ive &s;cor|butick
<PB N="10" REF="004012_0014_100364BB811870F8">like colliquation of the Blood and Juices. Ana|&s;arcous</HI> &s;welling or blotedne&s;s of the face, in &s;ome to that degree as to &s;hut up the Eyes; the &s;ame <HI>Oedemetous</HI> &s;wellings in the extremities, in a few an Infiltration in the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Petechiae,</HI> Purple &s;pots, &s;corbutick like <HI>&s;ugillations</HI> upon the leaft &s;cratch or brui&s;e; <HI>hamorrhages</HI> of all &s;orts, by the No&s;e, from the Lungs in expectoration, by Stool, by Urine, <HI>Profluniums</HI> in Women <HI>tempore non debito;</HI> the&s;e are di&s;mal <HI>phanomina</HI> in the &s;tate of any acute Fever, u. g. <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and &s;carce any recover; but in our di&s;temper being only &s;hort tem|porary con&s;equential ails, &s;carce any of them prov|ed mortal, but gave way to a &s;oft milk diet, in &s;ome to <HI>Cortex Peruw.</HI> or <HI>Elixir Vitrioli</HI> in others; a Girle aet. 14. with haemorrhages of &s;everal &s;orts, with Purple &s;pots, and &s;corbutick like &s;ugillations, recovered, notwith&s;tanding of a very loo&s;e <HI>Regi|men.</HI> N. B. The&s;e were not to be attributed to the <HI>Mercurial</HI> admini&s;trations, becau&s;e they equally happened to tho&s;e who had taken no Mercury.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Where the de&s;ecation has not been compleat,</HI> from want of natural &s;trength, or from catching cold, or from undue evacuations: the <HI>reliquiae</HI> were thrown off by <HI>&V;rtications,</HI> by <HI>Ve&s;ications</HI> in &s;everal parts of the Body, by <HI>&s;erpiginous</HI> eruptions chiefly in the face, by purulent <HI>Pu&s;tules,</HI> by Boils, by &s;wel|lings and <HI>impo&s;tumations</HI> in the groin, armpits and other parts of the Body. The mo&s;t frequent con|&s;equential ail of this kind is, when from cold re|ceived, the <HI>glands</HI> and cellulary tegument called the <HI>panicula adipo&s;a</HI> in the fore part of the neck becomes infiltrated and ob&s;tructed; if not &s;oon re|&s;olved by the continued fotus of warm woollens and hot animating applications; the induration in|crea&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="004012_0015_100386C59605B200">and &s;preads every way, &s;o as to &s;uffocate &s;ome, in others they &s;phacelate and become Ulcers mortal or of difficult cure: thus a few have died with us in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> but many in the Country. By catching cold likeways the <HI>Ton&s;ils</HI> have afterwards inflamed and come to &s;uppuration: In a young Woman the <HI>Ton&s;ils</HI> and <HI>&V;vula</HI> being much ulcera|ted, did unite and coale&s;ce into one ma&s;s and re|main &s;o; this might have been prevented by fre|quent gargling.</P>
<P>While the&s;e indurations are only in the form of <HI>Kernels</HI> as they are vulgarly called, woollen mufflers, <HI>Empl. de Ranis cum Mercurio</HI> and the like, with gentle <HI>Catharticks,</HI> &s;oon re&s;olves them. <HI>Catapla&s;ms</HI> in this ca&s;e have done much mi&s;chief; becau&s;e &s;o &s;oon as they are become cold, they act as a chilling damp upon the part, and de&s;troy its vitality. When they arrive to the &s;tate of putrid flaccid Ulcerations, dige&s;tives and &s;oft fomentations in|tenerate tenerate the part and occa&s;ion the Ulcer to &s;pread; &s;pirituous animating de&s;iccative dre&s;&s;ings have done better. Expo&s;ing the part to the cold, either in &s;tate of Tumefaction only, or in the &s;ub&s;equent ex|ulcerations aggravates the ail.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From the violence which the Nerves have &s;uffered in this Illne&s;s;</HI> even where the Symptoms were ap|parently mild, they all complain of great faintne&s;s and Univer&s;al weakne&s;s, particularly in the joints-Some Women have Hyfterick affections, in a few upon recovery imbecility of mind or &s;illine&s;s, in &s;ome &s;tammering or lo&s;s of Speech for a few days, &s;ome have had &s;hort fits of Melancholy, &s;ome were &s;eized with Epileptick fits, but not &s;o as to become habitual. All the&s;e di&s;orders &s;oon vani&s;hed, as the Patient recovered his Strength in cour&s;e of time,
<PB N="12" REF="004012_0016_1003644C52E91C38">and by the help of a re&s;torative cordial <HI>Regimen</HI> and diet.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Other con&s;equential ails in common with other fevers;</HI> particularly where the Strength of nature has been much impared by the di&s;temper it &s;elf, or by immoderate evacuations, the Patient is left in a langui&s;hing weakne&s;s. Where the Eruption has been impeded by being expo&s;ed to the cold, or by un&s;ea&s;onable <HI>&V; S.</HI> or <HI>Catharticks;</HI> the patient falls into <HI>Hectical wa&s;tings,</HI> fatal to &s;ome in a very &s;hort time. All who underwent immoderate evacuati|ons, were a long time in recovering of their Strength.</P>
<P><HI>SCHOLIA or &s;ome general remarks upon the whole.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This &s;eems to be a new kind of Epidemical di&s;|ca&s;e.</HI> It is not the &s;ame with the <HI>Aphthae</HI> which have at times prevailed in <HI>Holland,</HI> as de&s;cribed by <HI>Fore&s;tus,</HI> and mentioned by <HI>Boerhaave</HI> in his Colleg|es. <HI>Tournefort</HI> &s;ays there is a di&s;temper not uncom|mon in the <HI>Levant, viz</HI> a Carbuncle or plague &s;ore in the bottom of the Throat; it carries off chil|dren in a few days, but does not affect grown People as does ours. Capt. <HI>Morton</HI> of late <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> Colony, who wrote many years ago his <HI>New. England Memorial,</HI> &s;ays that an. 1650. a di&s;ea&s;e in the Mouth and Throat prevailed, which proved mortal to many in a &s;hort time; but he does not de&s;cribe it, and mentions nothing of a Fever. In <HI>Bo&s;ton November</HI> 1719. a &s;light milary fever chiefly with children, but was over in two or three days, unle&s;s by catching cold it continued appearing and di&s;appearing alternately for &s;ome days longer; there was no complaint of the Throat, and no deaths en&s;ued. It is not the &s;ame with the &s;ore Throats which are ob&s;erved from
<PB N="13" REF="004012_0017_100386CCDDF24A50">time to time in &s;ome of our Country Towns, e&s;pe|cially in the Winter &s;ea&s;on: the&s;e are Endemial and con&s;titutional, being tumefactious and exulce|ratious with fluxion in the <HI>Fauces</HI> and Neck; pro|ceeding from an inten&s;e &s;cropholous, &s;corbutick, or <HI>P&s;orick</HI> habit (in &s;uch &s;ubjects ve&s;ications by <HI>Can|tharides</HI> did putrifie) without any Eruptive fever: ours have generally an Eruptive fever or tendency that way, &s;o that of tho&s;e who have died in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> not above one in &s;even died of any Throat ail, but of this fever. It is however ob&s;ervable that the Serophulous and P&s;orick, are mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of this di&s;temper, and &s;uffer more remarkably.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Epidemical di&s;temper is no creature of the Sea&s;ons,</HI> it having prevailed from <HI>May</HI> 1735. when it fir&s;t emerged, the whole year or all the Sea&s;ons round. <HI>It is no produce of peculiar climates and &s;oils,</HI> becau&s;e it hath made its appearance in various places from <HI>Pemaquid</HI> in 44 N. Lat. to <HI>Carolina</HI> South|ward, and as we are lately informed, it is in our <HI>We&s;t India I&s;lands.</HI> It is remarkable that in damp places, as near large Ponds, fre&s;h water Rivers, woodlands, and the like, it has done the greate&s;t execution, as does the <HI>Rot</HI> among&s;t <HI>Sheep</HI> in fenny Lands.</P>
<P><HI>It is not per&s;onally infecting after the rate of the Plague, Small Pox,</HI> &amp;c. where every Per&s;on is &s;u&s;|ceptible, excepting a very few <HI>anomolous</HI> con&s;titu|tions. Children are the mo&s;t obnoxious to any infection; but with us &s;everal Children in the family, where the di&s;temper appeared, have e&s;cap|ed: it is true where it happens in a family, it fre|quently &s;eizeth &s;everals, as is the ca&s;e with our Country <HI>Peripneumonick Fevers,</HI> and our Autumnal remitting &s;low Fevers, which cannot be &s;aid to be
<PB N="14" REF="004012_0018_100386D1C9EC15B8">contagious. The di&s;tance in time of Infection to be &s;uppo&s;ed received from a &s;ick Per&s;on, to the time of the di&s;temper's appearing in the &s;uppo&s;ed infected, could never, with any rea&s;onable allowance of latitude, be reduced to any rule, as in Small-Pox, Mea&s;les, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We have <HI>Anatomically</HI> in&s;pected Per&s;ons who died of it with &s;o inten&s;e a <HI>faetor</HI> from the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, that &s;ome Practioners could not continue in the room; but without be|ing infected our &s;elves or carrying it into families. Many children without re&s;erve, frequent the hou|&s;es and chambers of the &s;ick, and e&s;cape. <HI>It does therefore proceed from &s;ome undi&s;covered quality of the air, affecting only peculiar con&s;titutions of per&s;ons and families:</HI> notwith&s;tanding of its being generally favourable, it proves fatal to certain families; ma|ny families for this rea&s;on have buried all or mo&s;t of their children, u. g. <HI>Boynton</HI> of <HI>Newbury-Falls</HI> lo&s;t his eight children, at <HI>Hampton-Falls</HI> in 5 fa|milies died 27 Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is a very anomalous Illne&s;s,</HI> &s;ome complain a day or two before they are confined, &s;ome are &s;eized as it were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, it is generally mo&s;t &s;evere with the&s;e la&s;t. In &s;ome a &s;orene&s;s of the Throat and darting pain there, reaching the Ears, is previous to all other Symptoms; in others the common Symptoms of a fever appear, before any inflamation or &s;pecks are perceivable in the <HI>Fauces.</HI> Some have a &s;ore Throat without any perceivable cruption, only a gentle breathing continued Sweat, or an increa&s;ed in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration with the peculiar &s;mell of the morbid <HI>effluvia.</HI> Some (but very few) have the cuticular eruptions without any &s;loughs in the Throat; only the <HI>Ton&s;ils, &V;vula, and velum Palati,</HI> tumified and inflamed; and in a few,
<PB N="15" REF="004012_0019_100364A818E52370"><HI>a purulent</HI> di&s;charge from &s;ome parts deeper than the <HI>Fauces,</HI> that is lower than the &s;ight can reach, the&s;e are not without danger. Many of tho&s;e who died early of a <HI>Necro&s;is,</HI> had no tumefaction, infla|mation or &s;pecks in the Throat.</P>
<P>The time of Eruption is very uncertain; in a very few it preceeds the &s;orene&s;s of the Throat, in a few it goes <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the affection of the <HI>Fauces;</HI> but generally it is (not much) later than the fir&s;t complaints of the Throat, in a young Woman it was later by 14 days.</P>
<P>In ruddy complexions the efflore&s;cence is very di&s;cernable; it is not &s;o di&s;tinctly perceivable in Brunets, Indians, and Negroes; unle&s;s the miliary Eruption have a con&s;iderable <HI>Relievo</HI> as in &s;ome, they generally &s;cale and peal notwith&s;tanding. Sometimes it appears only in the cheeks, &s;ometimes only a few clu&s;ters in the extremities. Sometimes the <HI>&s;uffu&s;ion</HI> was &s;carce miliary and vani&s;hed in&s;en|&s;ibly by becoming gradually paler without &s;caling. Where the Miliary Eruptions were con&s;iderable, the extremities peel in &s;craps or &s;trips like <HI>Exuviae;</HI> in one or two the nails of the fingers and toes did ca&s;t off. The period or continuance of Eruption is &s;ometimes prolonged by weakne&s;s of nature, by undue evacuations, or by the Patients being expo&s;|ed to the cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. In &s;ome who were very &s;lightly affected, their Illne&s;s was of a much &s;horter continuance, than is de&s;cribed in the Standard kind. <HI>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who died of the Phy&s;ician died by immoderate evacuations.</HI> As to the deaths, only a few were occa&s;ioned im|mediately by any di&s;temperature of the Throat; they were generally the effect of the Fever, either by an immediate <HI>Necro&s;is</HI> at fir&s;t &s;eizure, or by the
<PB N="16" REF="004012_0020_100386D9C61E4CA8">ordinary fatality of Fevers, or by con&s;equential ails. In <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> at a medium of the la&s;t eight heal|thy years (1723. 1724. 1725. 1726. 1727. 1728. 1732. and 1733) in the Months of <HI>October, Novem|ber, December, January, February, March, April</HI> to 18th <HI>May,</HI> died <HI>pr. an.</HI> 268 Whites and Slaves; this year in the &s;ame &s;pace of time died 382, is 114 <HI>extra</HI> deaths, and may be re&s;onably charged to this Illne&s;s, it being otherways a healthy time: of the&s;e 114. about 71 ca&s;es came to my knowledge, whereof in the fir&s;t period died 35, in the &s;econd period 28, and of con&s;equential ails, 8. Of the&s;e 71, only about 10 can be &s;aid to have died of &s;ore Throats. Of the&s;e 71 only 9 were upwards of 14 <HI>aet.</HI> According to the neare&s;t e&s;timate I can make in round numbers, about 1 in 35 have died, that is about 4000 Per&s;ons in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> have had this di&s;tem|per, which is about one 4th part of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Summer 1735 was unu&s;ually wet and chilly with many Ea&s;terly winds, in the Summer &amp; Autumn it prevail'd and was very mortal in &s;everal Country Towns. In <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> it began in Autumn, but did not prevail until Winter, which was not rigid with hard fro&s;ts as is u&s;ual, but with a very di&s;agreeable chill in the air, e&s;pecially in the Month of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, in which Month was our greate&s;t Mortality.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Mo&s;t Malignant di&s;tempers affect to throw off their malignancy by &s;ome Emunctory.</HI> The de&s;pumation of this acrid inqination of the juices in our di&s;temper, that is, its natural <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> &s;eems to be by the patent and &s;alutary <HI>Emunctories</HI> of the <HI>Fauces</HI> and skin. In corro&s;ive taints, u. g. Venereal and others, a <HI>Mer|curial ptyali&s;m</HI> and &s;udorifick decoction of the <HI>woods,</HI> an&s;wer be&s;t; this gave us the hint of promoting
<PB N="17" REF="004012_0021_100386DDE23FBB10">the tendency of nature in our Illne&s;s, by Mercurials, and gentle breathing Sweats a bed; which with good management &s;eldom fail'd, excepting where the <HI>Necro&s;is</HI> was irremediable from the beginning.</P>
<P><HI>Some affiction of the Throat &s;eems to attend mo&s;t kinds of Eruptive Fevers.</HI> In the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> (even where the pu&s;tules and other Symptoms were in the &s;mal|le&s;t degree) they all complain of a &s;orene&s;s of the Throat, but without ulcerating. In the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> there is a hoar&s;ne&s;s, and &s;orene&s;s of the Throat. <HI>In ours</HI> be&s;ides the &s;orene&s;s, tumefaction, and inflam|mation in the <HI>Fauces;</HI> there are &s;pecks or &s;loughs of a mellow white or Cream colour, like tho&s;e on the in&s;ide of the cheeks in a Mercurial ptyali&s;m; the Scrophulous and Venereal ulcers in the Throat are yellow; Aphthae are more of the nature of <HI>phlyc|tenae;</HI> many of our Patients complain of a copperi&s;h ta&s;te or peppery &s;mart in the Throat, as they ex|pre&s;s it.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>As in all other di&s;tempers &s;o in this there do &s;ome|times happen violent Symptoms, meerly from the Regimen and Medicines u&s;ed;</HI> which on that account are not of that bad con&s;equence, as if they had proceeded from the di&s;temper in its natural cour&s;e u. g. in &s;ome con&s;titutions a <HI>Turbith bolus</HI> operates with violence, &s;o as to occa&s;ion &s;hiverings, tor&s;ions of the Bowels, and Spaims, as if the Patient were moribund: <HI>Calomel</HI> even in very &s;mall do&s;es &s;eizeth the Mouth of &s;ome to a very con&s;iderable degree of inconveniency.</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>We did not ob&s;erve any genuine &s;econd &s;eizures.</HI> It is true, being Winter Sea&s;on, many common &s;ore Throats, that is, relaxations of the <HI>&V;vula</HI> and in|flammations of the Ton&s;ils; have pa&s;&s;ed with the le&s;s ob&s;erving practitioners, for the genuine Epe|demick
<PB N="18" REF="004012_0022_100386E3B6944E28">and were u&s;ed accordingly; &s;uch have after|wards had this Illne&s;s, and was erroneou&s;ly called a &s;econd &s;eizure. N. B. Our <HI>Epidemick</HI> is attended with no cough, unle&s;s when complicated with a cold or &s;ome old habitual <HI>Tu&s;&s;is:</HI> upon recovery, it leaves frequently a &s;mall <HI>catarrhous</HI> colliquation or cough, but of &s;hort continuance.</P>
<P>In &s;ome after being well, upon catching cold, the <HI>Ton&s;ils</HI> have been inflamed even to &s;uppuration; in others the <HI>&V;vula</HI> and <HI>Velum Palati</HI> infiltrated and &s;ome <HI>phlyctenae</HI> or common <HI>Aphthae,</HI> have appeared. Such have al&s;o by &s;ome been deem'd as &s;econd &s;eizures, and u&s;ed as &s;uch.</P>
<P>After a long continuance of cold chilly Weather, there &s;et in &s;uddenly warm Weather hot as mid Sum|mer. <HI>May</HI> 25th, 26th, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;everal children, who formerly had this Eruptive &s;ever, have an efflore&s;cence or <HI>miliary</HI> eruption by the heat, as is not unu&s;ual with children in hot weather: this was by mi&s;take of &s;ome practitioners and others, called a &s;econd &s;ei|zure.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>No conditions of Mankind were exempted</HI> (in our Epidemical Autumnal <HI>dy&s;entery A.</HI> 1734. the Ne|groes e&s;caped) Europeans, We&s;t-India I&s;landers, Indi|ans and Negroes, of all ages, were equally &s;ubject to it: but, as in mo&s;t Epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, it affected Chil|dren and the younger Per&s;ons more generally.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>This is a Real Hi&s;tory of the di&s;temper as it ap|peared in Bo&s;ton New-England,</HI> taken clinically from the life and not copied. There is no &s;troak or clau&s;e, but what I can vouch by real not imaginary ca&s;es. It is founded only upon ob&s;ervations or <HI>phaenomina,</HI> that is upon the Symptoms that appeared in the cour&s;e of this Epidemical di&s;ea&s;e; it mu&s;t therefore be of permanent truth.</P>
