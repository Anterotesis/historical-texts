<HEAD>A Second LETTER to a Friend, relating to the Defeat of the French and Indians at Lake-George.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter to you, relating to the <HI>Ohio-Defeat,</HI> I took a brief Notice of our <HI>Crown-point</HI> expedition; di&s;covering &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at its having been &s;o long delayed. I am now well plea&s;ed with that delay; as it has given occa&s;ion to the <HI>greate&s;t Action,</HI> in its kind, that ever happened in <HI>North-America.</HI> Never was &s;uch a battle fought here before!&mdash;Never had we op|portunity before of gaining &s;o glorious a conque&s;t over &s;o great an army!&mdash;I gave it al&s;o as my opinion, <Q>that the <HI>New-England</HI> troops, by rea&s;on of this delay, would have the <HI>whole power of Canada</HI> to contend with;</Q> in which I happened to make a right judgment. For, the day you publi&s;hed my letter, an expre&s;s arrived from General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> advi&s;ing, <Q>that the &s;pies he had &s;ent out were returned, and bro't him intelligence, that <HI>all Canada</HI> was in motion, the roads filled with waggons, tran&s;porting all manner of &s;tores to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and numbers of men continually going there to reinforce <HI>Fort-Frederick</HI></Q> Upon which the <HI>General</HI> went on to &s;ay, <Q>that a large reinforcement was, in this &s;ituation of affairs, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary on our &s;ide;</Q> recommending it to the &s;everal <HI>New-England</HI> colonies "to be as &s;peedy in making it as might be;" and a&s;&s;uring them, <Q>that, in the mean time, in&s;tead of being idle, he would employ his men in building a <HI>Fort</HI> at the entrance upon the carrying-place towards <HI>Lake George,</HI> or, as the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>Lake Sacrament,</HI> and after that, clear a road thro' the carrying-place to the head of the <HI>Lake,</HI> and build another fort at that important pa&s;s, by which time he hoped the reinforcements would be rai&s;ed and &s;ent, enabling him to proceed on his de&s;ign.</Q> It was while our <HI>General</HI> was at <HI>this pa&s;s,</HI> and before he had built the &s;econd fort, or received any reinforcements, that he was attacked by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007382_0003_102B8CCDCBDA1690">
You have probably &s;een his Letter to the <HI>Governours</HI> of the <HI>&s;eve|ral Colonies</HI> concerned in the <HI>Crown-point</HI> expedition; giving an account of his engagement with, and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t, the enemy: For it was printed the very day it came to hand, that every one might be ac|quainted with its contents. And if you have &s;een this letter, you mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with it, and conceive an high opinion of the <HI>General'</HI>s merit. Perhaps, the be&s;t bred <HI>regular</HI> could not have di&s;po&s;ed matters, under like circum&s;tances, with greater wi&s;dom.&mdash;And the vein of mode&s;ty that runs thro' his whole narrative cannot but recommend him to all who are capable of di&s;cernment.&mdash;But as his letter was wrote &s;o &s;oon after the action, it was impo&s;&s;ible the account of things &s;hould be particular enough to &s;atisfy the curiou&s;ly inqui&s;itive.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore give you a <HI>&s;ummary Ab&s;tract</HI> of what we have more lately received, that may be depended on for fact; from whence you will ea&s;ily be let into a clear and ju&s;t Idea of this whole Matter. And, as you will probably expect it from me, I &s;hall hereupon add a few tho'ts tending to &s;et the <HI>importance</HI> of this <HI>conque&s;t</HI> in a proper light before you; not forgetting, before I fini&s;h, to acquaint you with the <HI>reinforcements</HI> the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies have rai&s;ed and &s;ent to guard again&s;t a di&s;appointment as to the <HI>pre&s;ent expedition:</HI> Upon which you will be at no lo&s;s to determine, that the burden laid upon the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies is, in point of <HI>charge,</HI> far beyond what they are able to bear, if <HI>Great-Britain</HI> does not interpo&s;e for our help.</P>
<P>I have been at the pains to con&s;ider and compare a number of let|ters, which have been &s;ent from the army, e&s;pecially from the officers in it, and tho&s;e among them, who&s;e Character I am acquainted with; I have likewi&s;e had per&s;onal conver&s;ation with a Gentleman of di&s;tinc|tion, who, a full week after the action was over, was &s;ent an expre&s;s by the <HI>General</HI> to this town; and with another al&s;o who came away about the &s;ame time: And the <HI>&s;um</HI> of what I have collected, I &s;hall relate to you under <HI>three divi&s;ions,</HI> an&s;werable to the <HI>three engagements</HI> our men had with the enemy.</P>
<P>On the 7th of this in&s;tant, a number of <HI>Mohawks,</HI> who had been out as &s;couts, returned, and informed the General, that they had found three large roads from the &s;outh-bay, which they were &s;atisfied could not be made but by the marching of &s;o many con&s;iderable bodies of men, who were probably gone to attack our fort at the carrying-place.
<PB N="4" REF="007382_0004_102B8CCF57C3D108">
The <HI>General,</HI> upon this, di&s;patched two expre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> the fir&s;t expre&s;s was killed by the enemy in going to the fort; and General <HI>John&s;on'</HI>s letter &s;ent by him to Col. <HI>Blanchard</HI> was found in the <HI>Aid de Camp'</HI>s Pocket.</NOTE> that evening to Col. <HI>Blanchard,</HI> the commanding officer <HI>there,</HI> the latter of which returned about 12 o'clock with this account, "that they had both heard and &s;een the enemy, and that they were about four miles from the fort." A council of war having been call'd the next morning, the re&s;ult was, that a 1000 men &s;hould be detached from the army under the command of Col. <HI>Williams,</HI> with 200 Indians under the command of <HI>Hendrick</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> &s;achem, and &s;ent to annoy the enemy, whether at the &s;ort, or in their retreat from it, ei|ther as victorious, or defeated. This was accordingly done, without any lo&s;s of time; and it made way for, what I call, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> engage|ment. For this detachment had not marched above 2 miles and an &frac12; before they <HI>unexpectedly</HI> found them&s;elves within reach of the enemy. They were fir&s;t di&s;covered by an advanced Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> with <HI>Hendrick</HI> at their head; who immediately fired upon them. This gave the alarm to Col. <HI>Williams,</HI> who endeavoured with a number of men to &s;ecure a <HI>rocky eminence</HI> hard by, from whence, as from a kind of ca&s;tle, he might annoy the enemy. But, as they had intelli|gence of his march, by a &s;cout they had &s;ent out, they had &s;ecured it before, lay there in ambu&s;cade, and upon his approach within &s;ure reach of their guns, they ro&s;e up, fir'd, and kill'd him, and many more, dead on the &s;pot. By this time the fight became very fierce on both &s;ides. The advanced party of <HI>Indians</HI> behaved with the utmo&s;t intrepidity; but perceiving they &s;hould be &s;urrounded, and de&s;troyed, they gave way; and as they pa&s;&s;ed by our men, they told them of their danger, and advi&s;ed to a retreat. They went on not|with&s;tanding, fighting with undaunted courage and re&s;olution; but finding them&s;elves over-powered with numbers, and almo&s;t encircled, they quitted the ground, firing as they gave back with con&s;tancy and fury. Five or &s;ix Hundred of them retreated with &s;uch dexterity, and vigorous exertment, that the return of this <HI>detachment</HI> to the camp was hereby rendered, in a manner, &s;afe and ea&s;y. The <HI>French Ge|neral</HI> owned, that we kill'd more of his men in this fight, than we lo&s;t of our own. And my informer a&s;&s;ures me, this acknowledgment of his was agreeable to the truth of fact. For he &s;aw him&s;elf, the
<PB N="5" REF="007382_0005_102B8CD143B704F0">
next day, and counted, upwards of 140 dead bodies in the place where the fight fir&s;t began; tho' he could not tell the preci&s;e number that were <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e they had been &s;tripped by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and lay naked. And be&s;ides this heap, as it were, of dead bodies, he tells me, they were &s;cattered more or le&s;s the whole way between the place where the engagement began, and the Camp. He further gave me to under&s;tand, that he took out his watch, when the fire was fir&s;t heard at the camp; that he penciled the time; that it was preci&s;ely 11 o'clock wanting 5 minutes; and that the retreat was not fini&s;hed till &frac12; after 12: So that this retreat, and the fight previous to it, con|tinued one hour and 35 minutes; from whence it appears, that our men were not over ha&s;ty in getting out of the way of danger: For they were di&s;tant from the camp no more than 2 miles and an &frac12;.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">General <HI>John&s;on,</HI> judging of the di&s;tance by the fire, &s;ays, it was 3 or 4 miles; but my informer a&s;&s;ures me, he was pre&s;ent with the &s;urveyer, when the di&s;tance be|tween the fort at the carrying-place, and camp, was accurately mea&s;ured with a chain; that it was 13 miles; and that the di&s;tance of the place where this fight began, from the camp, was no more than 2 miles and an &frac12; at farthe&s;t.</NOTE> To me it &s;eems very wonderful, con&s;idering the &s;uperiority of the enemy in number, and their coming upon our men <HI>unawares,</HI> that they were not intirely routed.</P>
<P>Some have found fault with this detachment; &s;uppo&s;ing that they &s;hould rather have been cut to pieces, than have turned their backs upon the enemy. But they herein talk wildly. A good retreat is the next glory to a victory. When troops are over-powered with numbers, and unawares too, the true&s;t courage is di&s;covered in de|vi&s;ing and executing the be&s;t methods to come off with as little lo&s;s as may be. Had our men been upon equal terms with the enemy, I &s;hould have tho't they had acted unworthy of the Name of <HI>New-England</HI> men, if they had given way upon any con&s;ideration what|ever. But they had now to contend, not only with a large body of <HI>regular veterans,</HI> but with <HI>irregular</HI> troops more numerous than them&s;elves. And, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, what would <HI>bravery,</HI> conducted by wi&s;dom, direct to, but to make as good a retreat as they could. They might have &s;tood, 'tis true, till they had all been killed; but, in that ca&s;e, they would have ju&s;tly merited the cha|racter of mad-men. Tis probable, I own, this retreat (at lea&s;t in regard of a number) might be attended with &s;urprize, di&s;order and confu&s;ion: And it mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been miraculous; as many of
<PB N="6" REF="007382_0006_102B8CD2E55649E0">
our young Men were here, who never before heard a gun fired in anger. Be&s;ides, there was not &s;o much as one <HI>regular</HI> in our whole army, either among the officers, or private men.&mdash;And further, they were now engaged, not with <HI>regulars</HI> only, but with <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> the manner of who&s;e fighting is <HI>irregular</HI> and <HI>confu&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;The wonder to me is, not that they retreated, or that numbers of them might be di&s;ordered in their retreat; but that they &s;hould be able, upon the whole, to make &s;o good a retreat; annoying the enemy all the while they were retreating, and yet managing their retreat &s;o as to come off with comparatively &s;o &s;mall a lo&s;s. Col. <HI>Williams,</HI> Major <HI>A&s;hley,</HI> Capt. <HI>Inger&s;ol,</HI> Capt. <HI>Porter,</HI> Capt. <HI>Ferral,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stod|dert,</HI> Capt. <HI>McGin,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stevens,</HI> Lieuts. <HI>Burt</HI> and <HI>Pumroy,</HI> fell in this engagement, with a con&s;iderable number of our private men. <HI>Hendrick,</HI> the noted <HI>Mohawk</HI> Sachem, fell likewi&s;e, with a number of <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>It may properly eno' be ob&s;erved here;&mdash;when the <HI>Mohawks</HI> found their <HI>great Sachem</HI> dead and &s;calped, they were exceedingly enraged; &s;urrounding the tent were the <HI>French General</HI> lay, and in&s;i&s;ting that he &s;hould be delivered into their hands, that they might &s;calp him al&s;o. It was with great difficulty he was &s;aved from fall|ing a &s;acrifice to their fury. Our officers were obliged to remove him from tent to tent to keep him concealed from them, and finally found it nece&s;&s;ary, notwith&s;tanding the badne&s;s of his wounds, to tran&s;port him privately to <HI>Albany;</HI> where he now is in a dangerous condition, if on this &s;ide the grave. The <HI>French</HI> han't behaved thus humanly and kindly towards <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners. When they hear of this and other civilities towards their <HI>General,</HI> and the other captives with him, it will, I hope, make them a&s;hamed of their pa&s;t conduct, and teach them to treat our people in a more human way, &s;hould any fall into <HI>their</HI> and the <HI>Indian'</HI>s hands, while united in any action.</P>
<P>It was not long after the return of this detachment to the Camp, before the enemy appeared in &s;ight, and found our men in readine&s;s to give them a warm reception. This was owing to the notice they had of their approaching towards them, and the gradual manner of it, occa&s;ioned by the above fight and retreat. It might have been of dangerous con&s;equence, had they &s;uddenly made an attack upon our camp; but as we had this warning, opportunity was happily
<PB N="7" REF="007382_0007_102B8CD5239056F0">
given us to throw up a <HI>brea&s;t-work</HI> of trees (as General <HI>John&s;on</HI> calls it); to plant a number of cannon in &s;uitable places about it; to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome eminences on our left flank, under the guard of a field-piece advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated; to line our brea&s;t|work throughout with men; and, in &s;hort, to put things in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, time and circum&s;tances would permit, to defend our&s;elves, and de&s;troy the enemy. And now came on the <HI>&s;econd Battle,</HI> perhaps, the mo&s;t furious and re&s;olute, on both &s;ides, that ever was fought in <HI>North-America.</HI> It opened between 11 and 12 o'clock (keeping to the <HI>General'</HI>s account) with the fire of the <HI>French</HI> regulars; but in a few minutes, the fire became general, and nothing was heard but the noi&s;e of guns. This part of the attack was mo&s;tly made upon our left wing, bearing towards the center; and it was principally &s;u&s;tained by the <HI>Connecticut</HI> troops, who behaved with great activity and valour. When the <HI>French</HI> found, upon a long and ob&s;tinate tryal, that they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed if they continued here, they moved to the <HI>right</HI> of our camp, where the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> regiments were po&s;ted; and upon this attack al&s;o they maintained a bri&s;k and re&s;olute fire for a long time, but were &s;o weaken'd by the warm and dextrous oppo&s;ition they met with, that their fire gradually grew feeble, and with ob|&s;ervable intermi&s;&s;ions: Upon which our brave men, together with the <HI>Indians,</HI> jumpt over the brea&s;t-work, re&s;olutely fell upon them <HI>hatchet</HI> in hand, drove them off the ground, pur&s;ued after them, &s;lew a great many, and took about 30 pri&s;oners, among whom was Baron <HI>de Die&s;kau,</HI> the General of all the troops lately come to <HI>Canada</HI> from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This Engagement, with the pur&s;uit, la&s;ted about 7 hours. Our lo&s;s was le&s;s now, than in the former fight; but the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the <HI>French</HI> was greater: According to the be&s;t accounts we killed, in this battle, 3 or 4 hundred of their men, officers and pri|vate &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>When General <HI>John&s;on'</HI>s letter fir&s;t came to town, we were ready to think, the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t have lo&s;t at lea&s;t a thou&s;and men; as the battle was of &s;uch long continuance, and we had the advantage of <HI>Cannon,</HI> and a <HI>Brea&s;t-work</HI> of trees to defend our&s;elves. Our Idea al&s;o of the bravery of the <HI>French</HI> was, by rea&s;on of this advan|tage, very much enlarged; and it &s;eemed nothing extraordinary that our army, under the above circum&s;tances, &s;hould get the better of
<PB N="8" REF="007382_0008_102B8CD705A07DA0">
them. But, from Major <HI>Hore,</HI> who came to this Government la&s;t week upon an Errand from the army, is one of its officers, and was excellently active in the late fight; as al&s;o from another Gentleman who came &s;ince, we were led to conceive more ju&s;tly of the matter. Our wonder now was, not that a 1000 were not killed, but that &s;o many as 3 or 400 &s;hould be &s;lain in this battle. For their account is, "that the battle was fought upon a plain, covered with pitch-pine trees, of various &s;izes, &s;ome &s;maller, &s;ome greater, as is common in &s;uch plains, in their natural &s;tate of wildne&s;s, and a thick under-growth of &s;hrubs, intermixed with brakes, as high as a man's wa&s;te; that no part of this plain was cleared, except only the road we had made from the fort at the Carrying-place to the Camp; that the <HI>French regulars</HI> marched in this road, and began the fight drawn up in order; that they kept their order but a &s;mall &s;pace of time, not long enough to receive a &s;econd di&s;charge from our Cannon; and that the battle was now carried on in the <HI>Indian</HI> way by the whole <HI>French</HI> army, <HI>regulars</HI> as well <HI>irregulars,</HI> &s;ome fighting behind trees, and &s;tumps, and others &s;quatting &s;o as to be defended by the under-growth of &s;hrubs and brakes." Tis ea&s;y, upon this Repre&s;entation of the Matter, to &s;ee, that the enemy were upon equal terms with us, tho' we had a kind of brea&s;t-work; nay, as it was nothing more [&s;o I am inform'd by one that was pre&s;ent when it was made] than bodies of trees laid &s;ingly upon the ground, round the Camp, and in many places &s;o as not to touch one another, I am ready to think, they had the advan|tage of us; e&s;pecially as the under-growth near the Camp had be|fore been cut down for the conveniency of the army. And from hence al&s;o it will not appear &s;trange, if our Cannon [three or four of which were the only ones that could be u&s;ed, and the&s;e not more than 3 or 4 rounds, it being to little purpo&s;e to fire them] did not do them the damage, we, upon the fir&s;t hearing of the &s;tory, might be apt to imagine. The plain truth is, after the <HI>regulars</HI> became <HI>irregulars</HI> in the manner of their fighting, there was no great &s;laugh|ter made, either by our <HI>Cannon,</HI> or <HI>random Mu&s;quetry.</HI> The chief execution was now done, partly by our men's watching for op|portunities to fire, when they could catch any of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Indi|ans</HI> within full view; for they are mo&s;t of them &s;o dextrous in the u&s;e of the Gun, as to be pritty &s;ure of taking a man down within an hundred yards di&s;tance: And partly, by their ru&s;hing upon them, to|wards
<PB N="9" REF="007382_0009_102B8CD90A9FF0B0">
the clo&s;e of the battle, and pur&s;uing them, not only with their Guns, but hatchets al&s;o.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the <HI>Hatchet</HI> (a weapon our men were all armed with) is, in our way of fighting, a more fatal in&s;trument, than even the <HI>broad Sword,</HI> or <HI>Bayonet,</HI> if managed with &s;kill. The <HI>Indians</HI> will readily fa&s;ten it in a man's &s;kull, at more than a rod's di&s;tance. Many of our people are equally dextrous in the <HI>throw</HI> of it; and all our men know its u&s;e &s;o well, that tis certain death to a man to be within fair reach of their aim, when &s;tretched forth to &s;trike with it.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our men, after they had entered on action, were lea&s;t fearful of any ill con&s;equence from the <HI>regulars;</HI> and they &s;uffered lea&s;t from them: Tho' none among the enemy &s;uffered &s;o much from us as <HI>the&s;e regulars,</HI> thro' their unacquaintedne&s;s with the <HI>American</HI> method of fighting. Few of them, comparatively, whether officers, or private men, are tho't to have e&s;caped with their lives. How el&s;e can it be accounted for, that the <HI>General</HI> &s;hould be taken alone? So I was particularly informed he was by Major <HI>Hore,</HI> who&s;e ac|count of this fact is confirmed by &s;everal letters from the army, particularly by one from General <HI>Lyman.</HI> Tis &s;carce credible, that the chief commanding officer, and one of &s;uch importance to the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t, &s;hould be left by all his <HI>regulars,</HI> both officers and common &s;oldiers, and in a wounded condition too, if they were generally alive. One would think, they mu&s;t, for &s;hame, have kept with him at all hazards. Thus much, I think mu&s;t be allowed to be certain; either that they were generally &s;lain, or &s;truck with &s;uch a panic, upon being pur&s;ued by our men, as to be out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>General <HI>John&s;on</HI> and Major <HI>Nichols</HI> were wounded in this engage|ment; and they only among the field-officers. The <HI>General</HI> re|ceived a Ball in his thigh; but he can now walk about, and we hope will be able to proceed in per&s;on in further pro&s;ecution of our de&s;ign, when the reinforcements are arrived. Col. <HI>Titcomb</HI> was the only officer, at lea&s;t above a Captain, that fell in this &s;econd battle. He was &s;hot dead on the &s;pot. And his fall is the more to be regretted, as he was well experienced in the method of battering forts. He had a principal hand in the erection of all the batteries at <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> and commanded one at that &s;iege, which was known by his name, and was eminently galling to the enemy. He went then, and now al&s;o, chiefly for the publick benefit; and his name ought to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity with honour.</P>
<P>One thing more may be worthy of notice with reference to this battle; and that is, that among the 2 or 300 arms that have already

been bro't into the Camp, a number appear to have been tho&s;e that were taken from us at the <HI>Ohio-defeat:</HI> From whence it is obvious to collect, that &s;ome of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or <HI>Canadians,</HI> or both, that came off conquerors at the <HI>Monongahela,</HI> were &s;lain at <HI>Lake-George.</HI>&mdash;This was the fate particularly of Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>Piere,</HI> who&s;e death is perhaps the greate&s;t lo&s;s the <HI>French</HI> could have met with, at this day; as he was the chief commander of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had mo&s;t influence to engage them in any de&s;ign again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> Engagement, as I may properly call it, was occa&s;ion'd thus.&mdash;Col. <HI>Blanchard,</HI> the chief officer at the Carrying-place, not knowing but they might need help at the <HI>Camp,</HI> detached to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance between 2 and 300 men, mo&s;tly <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Yorkers,</HI> under the command of Capt. <HI>McGinnis.</HI> Between 4 and 5 o'clock they reached the place were Col. <HI>Williams</HI> had been attacked in the morning, and there they found about 500 of the enemy (chiefly <HI>Indians</HI>), who had fled from the former battle, and were come hither to refre&s;h them&s;elves, &s;calp our dead, take their packs, and get off. Our men fell upon them with the greate&s;t fury, made pri&s;oners of &s;ome, killed a great many, and intirely routed them; driving them off the ground, and recovering more of their packs than they could carry with them to the Camp.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This engagement was begun near the place, where the <HI>French</HI> had encamped the night before, and where they had left their baggage. Accordingly being thus driven off, our people the next day, bro't in 4 or 5 waggon loads of Ammunition, Provi&s;ions, Blankets, &amp;c. And they &s;ince find, that their flight was &s;o ha&s;ty, and &s;o much in a fright, that, as they fled, they dropt their blankets, bread, and even &s;ome of the &s;calps of our men.</NOTE> It can &s;carce be accounted for, that they &s;hould be able to accompli&s;h all this, upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition than <HI>that</HI> of the enemy's being di&s;|pirited with the dre&s;&s;ing they had received a little before, and mul|tiplying, in their fright, the numbers with which they were now be&s;et. We lo&s;t but a few men in this fight. General <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;ays, two were killed, eleven wounded, and five mi&s;&s;ing. Among the wounded is Captain <HI>McGinnis,</HI> who behaved with prudence and valor. He is &s;ince dead of his wounds. The &s;laughter of the enemy was very con&s;iderable. The account we have received is, that we &s;lew near an hundred of them: Thus ended the memo|rable 8th day of this in&s;tant <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>Our lo&s;s, upon the whole, amounts to 187 <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> 126 killed, and 61 mi&s;&s;ing: Tho', of the mi&s;&s;ing, 20 are returned, and probably
<PB N="11" REF="007382_0011_102B8CDCCBB75808">
more by this time. I can't learn, that the <HI>Indians</HI> lo&s;t more than from 15 to 20. The wounded are 94 <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and about 10 or 12 <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-regiments are the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, as they were mo&s;t in action. Two of their 3 colonels were killed, and one of their majors [another was wounded], be&s;ides &s;everal of their Captains and Lieutenants; and among them, are the greater part of the private men that were &s;lain. The lo&s;s on the enemy's &s;ide was much greater than on our's. We know not the number of their wounded; but between five and &s;ix hundred were probably &s;lain in all the en|gagements, and it may be yet more; for our people are daily finding dead bodies. The account from <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Albany</HI> is 700: But the preci&s;e number of the &s;lain will never be known. The <HI>Indians,</HI> we are all &s;en&s;ible, are &s;trangely &s;ollicitous to hide their dead, and will run all hazards to this end. And they have doubtle&s;s concealed numbers of their killed men. We are &s;atisfied of this, not only from their known temper and practice, but from our having found at lea&s;t 40 <HI>biers,</HI> [poles with cro&s;s-&s;ticks of wood, ha&s;tily put together] be|&s;meared with blood, upon which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, they carried off numbers of their &s;lain. Our people have al&s;o found &s;ome of their concealed dead, particularly 4 or 5 <HI>Indians</HI> in a &s;unk piece of land.</P>
<P>I may properly take notice here of, what I e&s;teem, an exce&s;s of civility in our people towards the <HI>French.</HI>&mdash;They &s;ent out parties, as &s;oon as they could with conveniency, not only to bury their dead, but to bury as many of them as might be without the knowledge of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to prevent their being <HI>&s;calped.</HI> This I call an <HI>exce&s;s</HI> of civility, not indeed con&s;idered in it&s;elf &s;imply, but comparing it with the conduct of the <HI>French</HI> towards us. They took no care to &s;ave any of our men, who fell at the <HI>&s;outhward,</HI> this &s;ummer, from being <HI>&s;calped;</HI> but &s;uffered them all, officers as well as common &s;oldiers, to have this indignity offered to them by the <HI>Indians:</HI> And moreover, they left their dead bodies upon the field of battle, as we have been well a&s;&s;ured, to putrify and rot there, unle&s;s they were devoured by the wolves and crows, and other bea&s;ts and birds of prey. Con&s;idering this inhuman conduct of the <HI>French,</HI> I can't but think, we exceeded in our civilities to the dead at <HI>Lake-George.</HI> For we have learnt by long experience, that unle&s;s we treat them as they treat us, we may expect ill u&s;age at their hands.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Number</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> engaged in this bat|tle, it remains &s;till uncertain. In the <HI>New-York</HI> News-paper, that
<PB N="12" REF="007382_0012_102B8CDEF672EF30">
came to Town la&s;t po&s;t, they are &s;aid to have been 3376. The account &s;tands thus. <HI>Regulars,</HI> 1126. <HI>Militia,</HI> 1200 form'd in 12 companies, with 20 regulars in each company. <HI>Indian Traders,</HI> 300. <HI>Militia officers volunteers,</HI> 30. <HI>Cadets,</HI> about 20. <HI>Indians</HI> 700. <HI>Total,</HI> 3376. 'Tis evident, I believe, from General <HI>Die&s;kau'</HI>s papers, that he bro't this number with him from <HI>Canada,</HI> thus par|ticularly a&s;certain'd: But whether he left any at <HI>Crown-point,</HI> or <HI>Ti|conderogo,</HI> and if any, how many, cannot perhaps be reduced to a cer|tainty. Thus much we may venture to &s;ay, as he knew our force, tis highly probable, he came with one that was &s;uperior. I cannot therefore &s;uppo&s;e, he had le&s;s than 2000 <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>In|dians,</HI> be&s;ides 5 or 600 <HI>regulars</HI> at lea&s;t. We had about 2100 <HI>New-England</HI> men, and between 2 and 300 <HI>Indians.</HI> The re&s;t of our men were partly confin'd by &s;ickne&s;s, but mo&s;tly left at the <HI>Carry|ing-place</HI> to take care of the <HI>fort</HI> there.</P>
<P>Having thus given you as particular an account, as you can rea|&s;onably expect, at pre&s;ent, of this <HI>victory</HI> over the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> I can't, in con&s;i&s;tency with the regard I have for my Country, re&s;train my &s;elf from going on to repre&s;ent, in a few words, the IMPORTANCE of it to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>You will, at once, be &s;en&s;ible of its great <HI>Importance,</HI> if you only turn the tables in your mind, and &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>French</HI> had been <HI>victors,</HI> in&s;tead of our army.</P>
<P>Some, by giving a loo&s;e to their imaginations, have &s;trangely heightened our melancholy condition, in this view of the matter. They have, in their fancies, block'd up all communication with our Troops at <HI>Lake-Ontario,</HI> and delivered our <HI>Governor,</HI> who is now there, a prey into <HI>French</HI> hands;&mdash;they have look'd upon <HI>Albany</HI> as be&s;ieged, and taken;&mdash;yea, they have tran&s;ported the enemy to <HI>New-York,</HI> and entertain'd fearful apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting the fate even of that <HI>city.</HI>&mdash;But the&s;e are vain imaginations, the imagery of mere fancy; and mu&s;t appear &s;o to all, who will only call to mind, what was done at <HI>Albany, Connecticut,</HI> and the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> parts of <HI>this Government,</HI> when it was known, that our army was attacked, but unknown what would be the i&s;&s;ue. We have been well a&s;&s;ured, they were beating to arms, and would have been upon the enemy, with trible their number, in a fortnight's time, had not tidings of our being conquerors rendered their immediate progre&s;s needle&s;s.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e fancied con&s;equences would not have taken
<PB N="13" REF="007382_0013_102B8CE0F7DADBD0">
place, had the <HI>French</HI> come off victorious: yet others, and very mi&s;chievous ones too, mu&s;t have followed. Our <HI>fort</HI> at the Carrying-place would certainly have fallen into their hands, and together therewith all the artillery, ammunition, and &s;tores, which had not been taken by them at the <HI>Camp;</HI>&mdash;awful numbers of our men mu&s;t have been &s;lain, and captivated; and, in a word, our whole army routed, and an entire end put to our de&s;ign again&s;t <HI>Crown-point,</HI> at lea&s;t for this year:&mdash;All which has been happily prevented, by its being or|dered in providence, that the victory &s;hould fall on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>The <HI>po&s;itive</HI> advantages of this conque&s;t are al&s;o very &s;ignal, and may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> worthy of particular notice.</P>
<P>Hereby the di&s;grace that was reflected on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> arms, on the banks of the <HI>Monongahela,</HI> is wholly wiped away. Were 300 of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;lain <HI>there?</HI> A much greater number of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> (5 or 600) were &s;lain <HI>here.</HI>&mdash;Were the <HI>Engli&s;h regu|lars</HI> &s;truck with a panic, when attacked <HI>there</HI> by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indian irregulars?</HI> The <HI>French Regulars,</HI> and <HI>veterans</HI> al&s;o, were &s;eized with an equal fright <HI>here,</HI> when pur&s;ued by <HI>New-England Irregu|lars:</HI> Otherwi&s;e they would not have fled &s;o univer&s;ally, and in &s;uch hurry, as to leave their <HI>fir&s;t officer</HI> alone, not having a &s;ingle man to help him.&mdash;Was the <HI>Briti&s;h General</HI> mortally wounded in <HI>that</HI> en|gagement? So was the <HI>French General</HI> in <HI>this:</HI> (he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead of his wounds, before this time) Only the advantage lies on our &s;ide; for <HI>our General</HI> was carried off by his own men, whereas the <HI>French General</HI> was left to fall a pri&s;oner into his enemies hands.</P>
<P>Hereby an happy turn has been given to the &s;pirits of our men on the one hand; and an unhappy one to the enemy's on the other. Our people, to an ob&s;erving eye, were plainly under a depre&s;&s;ure, oc|ca&s;ioned by the <HI>horrid &s;laughter</HI> at the <HI>&s;outhward,</HI> the like whereto had never before been &s;een, or heard of, in the Country; while, on the other hand, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were flu&s;ht with the victory they had obtained, and di&s;po&s;ed therefrom to undertake any thing, imagining there would be no &s;tanding before them: But, by what was done at <HI>Lake George,</HI> this &s;tate of mind has luckily been inverted. We are now rai&s;ed in our &s;pirits, they &s;unk in their's:&mdash;We go on, in our de&s;ign, animated with new life and vigor; they oppo&s;e us di&s;|couraged and intimidated:&mdash;We act again&s;t them as conquerors; they again&s;t us as having been fairly beat from the field of battle, and quite routed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007382_0014_102B8CE2A9769FC0">
In fine, hereby the &s;trength of the enemy has been greatly weak|ened. They have lo&s;t their <HI>General,</HI> an experienced warrior, who was purpo&s;ely &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to be at the <HI>head</HI> of their military affairs; and they have lo&s;t al&s;o, together with him, mo&s;t of their offi|cers of di&s;tinction and worth, and a great number of their common &s;oldiers. 'Tis true, 2 or 3 of our chief officers, and 10 or 12 inferior ones, all men of bravery, were &s;lain in the &s;ame field of battle, as well as a con&s;iderable number of our private men: But the lo&s;s on their &s;ide, with re&s;pect to officers as well as common &s;oldiers, is far greater than on our's. Their pri&s;oners &s;ay, their army is ruined. And, per|haps, after a deduction of their dead, their wounded, their captivated, their de&s;erters, their lo&s;t and peri&s;hed in the woods, their number (fitted for action) will not be more than <HI>half</HI> what it was, when they came forth again&s;t us. This is certainly a great advantage to us, and an equal di&s;advantage to them. They will doubtle&s;s, be rein|forced from <HI>Canada;</HI> but &s;o will our army from <HI>New-England:</HI> And <HI>Canada,</HI> we know, can't &s;upply &s;uch numbers of men, as it is in the power of <HI>New-England</HI> to do. And, by rea&s;on of this effort of the <HI>French,</HI> in which they were intirely di&s;appointed, we are better able to judge, what reinforcements may be nece&s;&s;ary, and are more warmly &s;pirited to rai&s;e and &s;end them, with the quicke&s;t di&s;patch.</P>
<P>And this minds me of my promi&s;e, not to forget to give you <HI>&s;uch an account</HI> of the&s;e reinforcements, as may be &s;ufficient to open to you the <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a large remittance from <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> And to this end, I need not be <HI>particular.</HI> It might be imprudent, under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to be &s;o: Tho' I may tell you, the <HI>General-A&s;&s;embly</HI> of this province, who are now &s;itting, have, this week, acted the part of wi&s;e and kind fathers to this people, in &s;end|ing home a repre&s;entation of what has been done, with reference to this affair; and I cannot but hope, and believe, it will procure a re|moval of that heavy weight of <HI>charge</HI> that is now lying on us, and mu&s;t &s;ink us into ruin, if we don't receive &s;upport from out <HI>mother-country.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay in general, that the reinforcements already gone, and now going, to our army, will make it a very formidable one, I mean, for this part of the world; and the charge, ari&s;ing from the pay, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, [almo&s;t doubled in its co&s;t, by the difficulty of tran&s;portation] of &s;uch a body of men, mu&s;t appear, to all who will allow them&s;elves to think, to be far beyond the utmo&s;t ability of a few poor, infant, colonies; as the <HI>New-England</HI> ones certainly are. They
<PB N="15" REF="007382_0015_102B8CE492B91F10">
are all engaged in the pre&s;ent expedition; they will all therefore need a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho' this is emphatically true of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-Province: Nor can it be denied, that <HI>they</HI> have the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t</HI> claim [I would not &s;ay an exclu&s;ive one] to the pity and help of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> They are the <HI>Principals</HI> in the enterprize on foot, and bear the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> part in it. But this is not all: The better half of each of the Regiments rai&s;ed, this &s;pring, upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment, under Major General <HI>Shirley,</HI> and Major General <HI>Pepperrell,</HI> were inhabitants of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI>-Bay; and the other two regiments, which are gone to <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> were almo&s;t <HI>wholly</HI> made up of men of the &s;ame <HI>Province.</HI> 'Tis true, the&s;e regiments are in the pay of the <HI>crown:</HI> But &s;till, the benefit of the labour of &s;o many men, in their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, is lo&s;t to the Pro|vince; and further, the proportion of the tax that would have fallen to their &s;hare, mu&s;t now be taken from them, and fa&s;tened upon the other members of the Govern|ment; which, you are &s;en&s;ible, will greatly increa&s;e their burden. Be&s;ides, no longer ago than la&s;t year we were at the expence of erecting a fort on the banks of <HI>Kenne|beck</HI>-River, under the cover of 8 or 900 men rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e, principally with a view to &s;ecure our Sovereign's rights in tho&s;e parts; the expence of which fort, in its erection, and maintenance to this day, has amounted to <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> our money, at the lowe&s;t computation. Nor is this all yet: As we are at war, not only with the <HI>Indians</HI> near <HI>Canada,</HI> but with all the tribes of <HI>ea&s;tern Indians,</HI> (the <HI>Penob&s;cots</HI> excepted, again&s;t whom al&s;o we are upon the point of proclaiming war,) we are obliged to keep a con&s;iderable number of our men con&s;tantly &s;couring the woods, from <HI>ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>we&s;t,</HI> in a line of 2 or 300 miles, to defend our out-&s;ettle|ments again&s;t their depredations.&mdash;In &s;hort, one <HI>&s;ixth</HI> part of the effective men in the Province are, at this day, in military &s;ervice; and more than <HI>double</HI> the number in our own pay, than when we went again&s;t <HI>Cape-Breton:</HI> And if the burden of that expedition was ju&s;tly tho't too heavy for us, much more is this the truth of the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent.&mdash;We &s;tand indeed a &s;ad chance of being an undone people, if we are not pitied, and relieved from the other &s;ide of the water.&mdash;'Twill otherwi&s;e be certainly impo&s;&s;ible for us to engage in any enterprize the next year.&mdash;We &s;hall have neither a heart-di&s;po&s;ing us, nor money enabling us, thereto: Whereas, if we are reimbur&s;ed this charge, and properly a&s;&s;ured, that any other attempts &s;hall be carried on at the expence of the <HI>Crown,</HI> it will give a &s;pring to our vigor, and we &s;hall join heart and hand in exerting our whole power to promote the &s;ervice of our King in &s;courging his and our enemies.</P>
<P>And if we are thus &s;upplied with money, let the <HI>&s;outhern colonies &s;leep on;</HI> let <HI>New-York</HI> government in particular, ingloriou&s;ly &s;it &s;till, and do nothing<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho' <HI>New-York</HI> &s;upply'd only 800 men upon the pre&s;ent expedition (300 of which they did not rai&s;e in their own government, being unwilling to lo&s;e &s;o much of the labour of their people): yet when a <HI>large</HI> reinforcement was found nece&s;&s;ary, even a <HI>greater</HI> number of men than was at fir&s;t &s;ent, they cho&s;e to lay upon their oars, not troubling them&s;elves to rai&s;e a &s;ingle man: So that the <HI>whole reinforcement</HI> of our army has been from the <HI>New-England</HI> colonies, who, to their honour be it &s;poken, have exerted them&s;elves beyond what could have been expected. 'Tis plain, from the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>conduct,</HI> our <HI>&s;outhern</HI> brethren have di&s;covered, that if any thing is done to purpo&s;e again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> it mu&s;t be done by <HI>New-England.</HI> And &s;hall they not be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in point of money, from <HI>Great-Britain?</HI>&mdash;Can it, in the name of rea&s;on, be tho't equal, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> colonies &s;hould be dimini&s;hed and impo|veri&s;hed, while the growth of the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> ones, in number and riches, is hereby promoted?&mdash;From the character we have of Governor <HI>Hardy,</HI> and the &s;pirit he has already di&s;covered, we hope <HI>New-York,</HI> under his admini&s;tration, will act more like friends to the common <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> intere&s;t.</NOTE>, while the
