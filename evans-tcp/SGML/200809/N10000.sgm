<OPENER><SALUTE>My Chri&s;tian Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LITTLE thought when I wrote the&s;e Sermons they would ever have been more public than the Preaching would make them. That they were compo&s;ed in ha&s;te, under many Avocations, and in early Life, are Rea&s;ons why I &s;hould decline com|mitting them to the Pre&s;s. But when I con&s;ider that Affection you &s;hewed me when I fir&s;t came among you, the great Kindne&s;&s;es and &s;teady Attachment I have ever &s;ince experienced, and the very general and repeated De&s;ire expre&s;&s;ed for their Pub|lication: I thought it not be&s;t to refu&s;e, and this mu&s;t be my Apology to the World.</P>
<P>THE Subject of them (Salvation) is the greate&s;t and noble&s;t, and demands your mo&s;t &s;erious Attention. And might I hope what is here offered would awaken or

&s;trengthen in you a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of it; it would give me a Satisfaction and Joy inex|pre&s;&s;ible. "For what is our Hope or Joy, or Crown of Rejoicing, are not even ye in the Pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming."</P>
<P>TO lead you to believe in Je&s;us as the Way, the Truth and the Life, as the only Foundation of your pre&s;ent or future Happine&s;s; and to excite you to a Temper and Conduct worthy his Name, has been the De&s;ign of my con&s;tant Preaching. Faith in Chri&s;t, and a practical Subjection to his Go&s;pel, I pray may ever be your habitual and di&s;tingui&s;hing Character.</P>
<P>THAT my Mini&s;try may be &s;ucce&s;sful to the&s;e Purpo&s;es, that I may have a daily Remembrance in your Prayers; and that the be&s;t of Heaven's Ble&s;&s;ings may re&s;t on you and your's, is the &s;incere De&s;ire of your affectionate Friend and Pa&s;tor,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS World is the Place of our Birth but not of our Abode; we cannot expect always to continue here. There mu&s;t be a Time, and how &s;oon is known only to God, when we are to be called hence, mu&s;t quit the Scene. That an End &s;hould be put to our Being is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed. Rea&s;on tells us otherwi&s;e, and Revelation certainly a&s;&s;erts the con|trary; and we have as much Evidence as we can, 'till we arrive at our de&s;tined Home. A &s;erious, an earne&s;t Concern about our future Condition, mu&s;t be both our Duty and Intere&s;t. We know the &s;tate <HI>there</HI> is different: Everla&s;ting Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery;

and as we realize the&s;e, &s;o &s;hall we be &s;ollicitous about the Que&s;tion in the Text, "what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?"</P>
<P>IN &s;ome preceeding Ver&s;es we find Paul and Silas going to their Devotions in the Hou&s;e of Lydia, who had been converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith and baptized. While pa&s;&s;ing, they met a Woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Spirit of Divination, and who brought by this Means her Ma&s;ters much Money. She declared to the People who they were; and they being grieved to &s;ee her in &s;uch unhappy Circum&s;tances, commanded the Spirit by whom &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to leave her. Her Ma&s;ters finding that now their Hopes of further Profit were at an End, were enraged at Paul and Silas, and entered a Complaint to the Magi&s;trates&mdash;that they exceedingly troubled the City&mdash;taught Cu&s;toms which were not lawful for them to receive, neither to ob&s;erve, being Romans. They were therefore commanded to be beaten, ca&s;t into Pri&s;on; and Orders given
<PB N="3" REF="012709_0007_0F8B8E21442E7328">
to the Jailor to keep them &s;afely: Who hav|ing received &s;uch a Charge thru&s;t them into the inner Pri&s;on, and made their Feet fa&s;t in the Stocks. They were not intimidated with the&s;e Things, but at Midnight and when all were a&s;leep, they prayed and &s;ang Prai&s;es to God. Upon this there was &s;ud|denly a great Earthquake, &s;o that the Foundations of the Pri&s;on were &s;haken, and immediately all the Doors were opened and every one's Bands were loo&s;ed. And the Keeper of the Pri&s;on awaking out of his Sleep, and &s;eeing the Pri&s;on-Doors open, he drew out his Sword, and would have killed him&s;elf, &s;uppo&s;ing, the Pri&s;oners had fled. But Paul cried with a loud Voice, &s;aying, do thy&s;elf no Harm, for We are all here. Then he called for a Light and &s;prang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out and &s;aid as in our Text, Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="012709_0008_0F8B8E22051EDA20">"GOD, we are told, does often rou&s;e up Men's &s;leepy and &s;en&s;ele&s;s and lethargic Minds by &s;ome pre&s;ent Terror, Judgment or Affliction, which brings them to con&s;ider the Concerns of their Souls and another World, when Nothing el&s;e will. This &s;hakes off their thoughtle&s;s Security, and alarms their &s;tupid and unthinking Minds, to look about them, and &s;ee what a dange|rous Condition they are in." But if this &s;hould not be the Ca&s;e, yet the Que&s;tion a&s;ked by the Jailor is important and ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and if properly con&s;idered may be u&s;eful to us.</P>
<P>I SHALL therefore make two or three Ob&s;ervations therefrom.</P>
<P>FIRST. We may ob&s;erve the va&s;t Im|portance of Salvation.</P>
<P>THIS the Jailor &s;uppo&s;ed when he a&s;ked the Que&s;tion, and this mu&s;t be by Others.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012709_0009_0F8B8E22CAC6B678">MAN was made upright, but he &s;oon &s;ought out many Inventions. Sin has enter|ed into the World, and Death by Sin, and &s;o Death has pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned. We are the Children of fallen Man, and are Our&s;elves Sinners. The Importance of Salvation therefore, will ap|pear, if we con&s;ider&mdash;The unhappy Situa|tion of Per&s;ons without it&mdash;and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>THOSE who are not in a State of Sal|vation are defiled and corrupted. They are e&s;tranged from God, under the In|fluence of Sin, and are di&s;po&s;ed &s;o to continue; they are unclean and unholy. This is the Ca&s;e with All who reject and refu&s;e the Salvation offered them, have not received nor are influenced by it. The Apo&s;tles found it &s;o in their Day. They declare of the Gentile World, that they were Enemies of God, being in a State of Idolatry and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. II. 1.</NOTE> That they
<PB N="6" REF="012709_0010_0F8B8E238B2FA1D8">
were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, wherein in Time pa&s;t they walked according to the Cour&s;e of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Di&s;|obedience. That <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. iv. 17, 18.</NOTE> they walked generally in the Vanity of their Mind, having their Under&s;tanding darkened, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Igno|rance that is in them, becau&s;e of the Blindne&s;s of their Heart: Who being pa&s;t Feeling have given them&s;elves over to work all Uncleanne&s;s with Greedine&s;s. So cor|rupt and defiled did they find them. And as to the Jews, they were al&s;o, by far the greate&s;t Part of them, by an univer&s;al Cor|ruption of Manners, lo&s;t in Sin. Their whole Head was &s;ick and their Heart was faint; and, as emblematical of their Corruption, it is repre&s;ented that there was no Soundne&s;s in them, but they had Wounds and Brui&s;es, and putrifying Sores. And if we con&s;ider &s;ome who call them|&s;elves
<PB N="7" REF="012709_0011_0F8B8E244254D510">
Chri&s;tians, and would think it hard to be deprived of the Name, yet do we not &s;ee many of The&s;e lead unholy, ungodly Lives, notwith&s;tanding all the Threatnings denounced again&s;t Sinners, all the terrible Things recorded in the Word of God. They &s;light and di&s;regard them. They have &s;inned, and will &s;in, and will not be deterred from it. They are unconcerned about their future Condition, overlook their Souls, as though they were of no Con&s;e|quence, can &s;ee them peri&s;hing before their Eyes without Remor&s;e or Compunction. Such then mu&s;t certainly be corrupted, e&s;tranged from God and Goodne&s;s, and therefore their Situation unhappy.</P>
<P>THEY al&s;o continually lie under the Anger of Almighty God.</P>
<P>IF defiled and corrupted, are e&s;tranged from Him, and if &s;o are his Enemies, and expo&s;ed to his Re&s;entment. For God is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and he is angry with
<PB N="8" REF="012709_0012_0F8B8E269ABF0008">
the Wicked every Day. And the Thoughts of this ought to alarm and terrify All who are con&s;cious of any wilful Wickedne&s;s or Immorality. For who knoweth the Power of God's Anger, which can excite Horrors and Pains in the Minds of Sinners, inten&s;e and durable beyond all Conception and Imagination. If we are afraid of falling under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Great and Powerful of this World, who yet, when they have done their utmo&s;t, can only kill the Body, how much more fearful mu&s;t it be to fall into the Hands of the ever living and holy God, who after he hath killed, hath Power to ca&s;t into Hell. Certainly, when God's utter Abhorrence of Sin is con&s;idered, and of tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to continue under it's Dominion; their Situa|tion mu&s;t be deplorable, and evince the Importance of Salvation.</P>
<P>AND they can have no inward Peace and Quietne&s;s of Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="012709_0013_0F8B8E2ACDA197F0">UNHAPPINESS mu&s;t ever attend the Practice of Sin. Mi&s;ery comes along with it, brings Torment to the Mind and Di&s;ea&s;e to the Body. All Ungodline&s;s has this Tenden|cy, and there are frequently In&s;tances there|of. The Fermentation of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and all the Effects of a &s;inful Mind, mu&s;t make Men unhappy. A State of Innocence would not have produced this. Man would have been a Stranger hereto. We read indeed of "the Plea&s;ures of Sin," but be&s;ide that they are of the ba&s;er and gro&s;&s;er Kind, 'tis &s;aid of them, "They are but for a Sea&s;on, for a Moment, and the End of them is Heavine&s;s. That the Ways of Sin may &s;eem broad and plea&s;ant, but that they lead down to Death and take hold on Hell." It is <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxii. 17.</NOTE> "Righteou&s;ne&s;s that gives Peace, and it is the Effect of that which is Quietne&s;s and A&s;&s;urance forever." It is for wicked Men to dread God, and to endeavor to bani&s;h the Thoughts of Him out of their Minds. What Peace and Satisfaction can

&s;uch have, who mu&s;t know that their Con|duct is di&s;honorable and ungrateful to God, unworthy their Characters, and will be pro|ductive of the greate&s;t Evils? Which brings me to &s;ay, that,</P>
<P>THOSE who are not in a State of Sal|vation, are liable to, and mu&s;t &s;uffer ever|la&s;ting Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>"THE Wages of Sin is Death."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE> Tho&s;e who reject the Means of Grace and Salva|tion, mu&s;t expect to reap the Fruit of their own Way and be filled with their own Devices. "The &s;ame, &s;ays the Scripture,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiv. 10.</NOTE> &s;hall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without Mixture into the Cup of his Indignation, and he &s;hall be tormented with Fire and Brim&s;tone, in the Pre&s;ence of the holy Angels, and in the Pre&s;ence of the Lamb. And the Smoke of their Torment a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever." That State is eternal, is what will

know no End, and compared with which, the longe&s;t Life of Plea&s;ure, hath not the Proportion of a &s;ingle Moment. Such then mu&s;t depart from the Pre&s;ence of God to dwell with Devils and damned Spirits for|ever, in the Place where the Worm dieth not and the Fire is not quenched.</P>
<P>NOW let us con&s;ider the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of tho&s;e who are of the contrary Character, are in a State of Salvation.</P>
<P>THEY are delivered from the Power and Dominion of Sin. They are redeemed from all Iniquity, that Sin &s;hould no longer reign in their mortal Bodies, that they might fulfil the Lu&s;ts thereof. The Situa|tion of Sinners we &s;ee is, that they are in Bondage and Slavery, &s;ubject to their Lu&s;ts, and to the Temptations, Arts and Cunning of a de&s;igning Adver&s;ary. But tho&s;e who are &s;aved, are in Mea&s;ure delivered here|from. The Creature &s;hall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the
<PB N="12" REF="012709_0016_0F8B8E2C80642C88">
glorious Liberty of the Sons of God. Their nobler Faculties have got the A&s;cendency and are triumphant. They are not carried away with every Sin and Temptation. Ini|quity has not the Dominion, but is rejected and renounced. They have the Influences of the Spirit of God, that Comforter which was promi&s;ed and is provided. And they po&s;&s;e&s;s him not as a tran&s;ient Vi&s;itant, but as a con&s;tant Gue&s;t; a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to mor|tify the Deeds of the Body, overcoming their Corruptions, all the Oppo&s;itions they meet with, helping their Infirmities, and purifying their Souls. And they are con|formed to God, his Image and Likene&s;s; are clean&s;ed from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit.</P>
<P>THEY have al&s;o the Pardon of their Sins. And what a glorious Privilege mu&s;t this be. "Ble&s;&s;ed, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. XXXII. 1.</NOTE> &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, is he who&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is forgiven, who&s;e Sin is co|vered; ble&s;&s;ed is the Man unto whom the

Lord imputeth not Iniquity." By this mu&s;t be meant, a full Indemnification from all pa&s;t Sins and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. It is to forget, forgive and remember them no more. It intends the Abolition of them, their Guilt, and freedom from the de&s;erved De&s;truction con&s;equent upon them, and a Reception to the divine Mercy. The Book is cro&s;&s;ed, the Debt is cancelled; and they are not &s;ubjected to the Payment. The Obligation to Puni&s;hment is made void. God no longer accounts Men ob|noxious, but the Sentence again&s;t them is revoked. This a&s;&s;uredly will be the Ca&s;e; for God is good, he is ready to forgive, he is plenteous in Mercy to all that call upon him. "There is no Condemnation to any who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h but after the Spirit."</P>
<P>AND they &s;hall at la&s;t be received to everla&s;ting Glory and Happine&s;s. They &s;hall be made to enter into the Joy of their Lord. The Wicked mu&s;t go away into

everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, but the righteous into eternal Happine&s;s and Life. Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed this by his Blood; entered Hea|ven by a new and living Way, and has con&s;ecrated it for them, through his Fle&s;h. He gives unto them eternal Life and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of his Hands. We have the De|clarations of God him&s;elf: who is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, or the Son of Man that he &s;hould repent. And who has de|clared, that they &s;hall inherit the Kingdom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth.

"Good Men have the &s;ure Word of Prophecy to found and direct their Faith. Here therefore they may fix their Foot with full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, rejoicing in Hope of the Glory of God."
<PB N="15" REF="012709_0019_0F8B8E2F87EE4218">
Certainly then our Salvation is not an in|different Thing, &s;eeing, without it, we &s;hall be forever mi&s;erable, and with it everla&s;t|ingly happy. And the&s;e mu&s;t evidence it's Importance.</P>
<P>DO we then &s;ee the Importance of Sal|vation, how thankful ought we to be that it is offered us.</P>
<P>THIS indeed is worthy our Thanks and demands our Gratitude. To God, who is the Author of it, who has found out a Way for Man whereby he may be reconciled to Him and be at Peace with his own Con|&s;cience. To Je&s;us, for that Compa&s;&s;ion and Grace which were &s;o con&s;picuous in him. God found out a Way for the Peace of Man, but that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s it, Chri&s;t him&s;elf dies, offers up his Body as an aton|ing Sacrifice. For it plea&s;ed the Father that in him all Fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell, and (having made Peace through the Blood of the Cro&s;s) by him to reconcile All Things
<PB N="16" REF="012709_0020_0F8B8E3097CC58A0">
to him&s;elf. And he is &s;till the Be&s;tower of it to Men. When therefore they are &s;en&s;ible of it's Importante, they eagerly and readily embrace the Way offered; are thankful there is one, their Hearts overflow with Joy and Gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE va&s;t Importance of Salvation &s;hews us the Stupidity of tho&s;e who are carele&s;s and unconcerned about it.</P>
<P>DID Men con&s;ider, they could not be &s;o negligent and heedle&s;s. It mu&s;t be owing to their Inattention to the great Things of their Peace, that they conduct as they &s;o often do: This is their Bane&mdash;this their Ruin. This is the Charge God brings again&s;t his People I&s;rael. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. I. 3.</NOTE> "My People, &s;ays he, do not con&s;ider." And in the Seventh of Ho&s;ea he complains of the Hy|pocri&s;y and Impiety of his People; but this was their Unhappine&s;s. "They con|&s;ider not in their Hearts, that I remember
<PB N="17" REF="012709_0021_0F8B8E3115757820">
all their wickedne&s;s. On Account of this, Sinners are often compared in the Scrip|ture to the brutal Creation. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. vii. 12.</NOTE> "He goeth after her &s;traitway as the Ox goeth to the Slaughter, and con&s;idereth not that it is for his Life." Therefore is it Men are &s;o ea&s;y as to their Wickedne&s;s, they do not con&s;ider the Tendency and End thereof. "He knoweth not that the Dead are there, and her Gue&s;ts in the Depths of Hell." "This is the Sleep and Lethargy of the Soul: It keeps Men unconcerned, though they are in the Way to Ruin, and upon the very Brink of De&s;truction." And if Men become religious, de&s;irous of Salva|tion in good Earne&s;t, they mu&s;t be awaken|ed out of their Stupidity, brought to think; and to &s;ay, as with the Jailor, "What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?"</P>
<P>LET us then be all excited by the Grace of God to con&s;ider how great this Salva|tion is, and to &s;eek after it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012709_0022_0F8B8E3346207370">IT is of the utmo&s;t Importance, demands our Attention, our greate&s;t Care. Con|&s;idering who is the Author, and who the Purcha&s;er; Nothing can be greater. Con|&s;idering Our&s;elves, our Character and Situ|ation, none can need it more. No great Arguments then are wanting to excite to it. The Unhappine&s;s of not being &s;aved is &s;et before us; the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of being &s;o, &s;hewn us; and None can be at a &s;tand. Now then is the Time&punc; now the accepted Time, and now the Day of Salvation. Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and Chri&s;t &s;hall give you Life. Know in this your Day the Things that concern your everla&s;ting Wel|fare, before they &s;hall be for ever hidden from your Eyes. Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, "con&s;ider your Ways." "Keep your Hearts with all Diligence." Seek him to enable you to know your true Intere&s;t and pur&s;ue it. To do it with Alacrity, with a Zeal adequate to it's Importance and Worth.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012709_0023_0F8B8E34030AD2E8">THE SECOND OBSERVATION I make from the Words is, That there is Some|thing to be done by us, in order to our being &s;aved. Here we &s;hall endeavor to con&s;ider&mdash;What is to be done&mdash;and then evince the Truth of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT is to be done.</P>
<P>NOW if we look into the Ver&s;e following our Text, we &s;hall find the Direction of Paul and Silas to the Jailor, when he a&s;ked what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved.

There are different Kinds of Faith, and accordingly have different Objects; as human, divine, and chri&s;tian.

<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord made a Declaration of his Father's Will to the World, and that "in tho&s;e Sermons, Parables and Di&s;cour&s;es of his which we find recorded in the four Evangeli&s;ts, in which the Will of God con|cerning the Way and Method of our Sal|vation is revealed.

<P>THE HISTORY. Thar there was &s;uch a Per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and as there de|&s;cribed. That he was the Son of God. In this Character he is repre&s;ented. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">i Luke i. 35.</NOTE> That holy Thing, &s;ays the Angel to Mary, which &s;hall be born of thee &s;hall be called the Son of God. This is the Character of one who is born of God and overcomes the World, that he believes that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 5.</NOTE> So when any were converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, they believed this. Thus the Eunuch tells Philip,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Acts VIII. 37.</NOTE> I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God.

Chri&s;t that he is the Son of God. And 'tis &s;aid of every one that &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God, that God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John IV. 15.</NOTE> So is it al&s;o &s;aid, that he was &s;ent of God. God &s;o loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son. And Chri&s;t &s;ays, I proceeded forth and came from God, nei|ther came I of my&s;elf, but He &s;ent Me. And being thus &s;ent, that he lived as is de|clared, performed tho&s;e wonderful Things recorded, &s;uffered an ignominious Death on the Cro&s;s, was laid in the Grave, ro&s;e from the Dead and a&s;cended to Glory.</P>
<P>HIS DOCTRINE is &s;aid to contain Pre|cepts, Promi&s;es and Threatnings. And a Faith in Chri&s;t includes a firm Belief of the&s;e, "of the Precepts of the Go&s;pel as the Matter of our Duty, and the Rule of our Life; and of the Promi&s;es and Threat|nings of it as Arguments to our Duty, to encourage our Obedience and deter us

from Sin." So that he who believes in Chri&s;t, believes the Go&s;pel, and believing that, he believes the Truth of it, and All it contains.</P>
<P N="2">2. To believe in Chri&s;t is to tru&s;t in, and depend on Him alone, for Salvation.</P>
<P>HE alone can procure it, and it is only He that can be tru&s;ted in for it. Now this may imply&mdash;that we are fully &s;atisfied and believe we can obtain Salvation only in, and by Chri&s;t&mdash;and al&s;o a full Per&s;wa|&s;ion of his being an able and all&s;ufficient Savior.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT we believe and are fully &s;ati&s;|fied we can obtain Salvation only in, and by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>CHRIST is the only Mediator between God and Man&mdash;the Medium of Acce&s;s to Him, or Means of Reconciliation with Him. The Apo&s;tle Peter when he had
<PB N="24" REF="012709_0028_0F8B8E3A08BEC118">
cured the lame Man, and was brought before the Rulers on that Account, thus declares: &dagger; Be it known unto you all, and to all the People of I&s;rael, that by the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God rai&s;ed from the Dead; even by Him doth this Man &s;tand before you whole. This is the Stone which you Builders rejected, which is now become the Head of the Corner. Neither is there Salvation in any other: For there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we can be &s;aved. The Favor of God being forfeited by Sin, Chri&s;t undertakes to make Atonement&mdash; to open a door whereby &s;inful Men may draw nigh to God, have Hopes of Audi|ence, Forgivene&s;s and Acceptance. His Death was to expiate Guilt by making Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice. Accordingly we read, "God laid upon Him the Iniqui|ties of us All&mdash;that we have Redemption through his Blood, even the Forgivene&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="012709_0029_0F8B8E3AC7010F70">
of Sins." It was this only that obtained it, we being redeemed not with corruptible Things as of Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Chri&s;t, as a Lamb without Blemi&s;h, and without Spot. To believe therefore in Chri&s;t is to be &s;atisfied there is no other Way and de&s;ire none.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY, &s;ays Dr. Doddridge, is the Religion of Sinners, and it never will be really welcome to a Soul that is not &s;en&s;ible of the Malignity of Sin. Many of Mankind forget God, do not &s;eek after him at all, will not have him to reign over them. But if their Con&s;ciences be properly awakened, they mu&s;t &s;ee their Dependence on him, and their Need of an Intere&s;t in his Favor: And as having ju&s;tly offended, they want one to interpo&s;e for them. For having proper Notions of God, they are &s;en&s;ible that his Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s are e&s;&s;ential to his Nature, as his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s. And there|fore when they con&s;ider them&s;elves as ap|pearing

in his Pre&s;ence, guilty of the greate&s;t Crimes, they mu&s;t be led to cry out, from a deep and inward Sen&s;e, Who is able to &s;tand before this holy Lord God? Where|with &s;hall I come before the Lord, and bow my&s;elf before the high God? Surely I need &s;ome perfectly righteous Mediator, high in his Favor, to introduce me to him, and to render my Acce&s;s &s;afe and comfor|table, by appearing as a Day's-Man betwixt us, to lay his Hand upon us both. And this tho&s;e who believe in Chri&s;t readily acknowledge, and heartily acquie&s;ce in.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY have al&s;o a full Per&s;wa&s;ion of his being an able and all&s;ufficient Savior.</P>
<P>THEY believe the truth of the Declara|tion, "that he is able to &s;ave to the utter|mo&s;t all that come unto God by him; &s;eeing he ever lives making Interce&s;&s;ion." They con&s;ider him as appointed of God. That God has laid in Zion, for a Foundation, "a tried Stone, a precious Corner Stone, a
<PB N="27" REF="012709_0031_0F8B8E3CA3FB0F40">
&s;ure Foundation." That God is infinitely wi&s;e and good, knows what are the be&s;t Means, mo&s;t adapted to an&s;wer Ends; and that whatever he determines to be be&s;t, they may undoubtedly rely on. They con&s;ider his Character, as the Son of God, and the Manner of his Appearance. That it was nece&s;&s;ary He &s;hould take Fle&s;h upon Him; and that &s;uch an high Prie&s;t became Men, who was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled and &s;eparate from Sinners. And They view Him as accepted of God&mdash;that He was an Offering and Sacrifice to Him for a &s;weet &s;melling Savor. Being therefore convinced of the&s;e Thins, they do accordingly tru&s;t in, and depend upon Him for Salvation. "Heartily con&s;ent to own and accept Him in the Characters He bears; and have their Spirits impre&s;&s;ed &s;uitably to the Nature and Importance of what they a&s;&s;ent to con|cerning Him. As He is the only Savior of Sinners, &s;et forth in the Go&s;pel for a Propitiation; through whom Pardon and
<PB N="28" REF="012709_0032_0F8B8E3ED2EAD1B8">
Acceptance with God may be had; and as He is &s;ufficient therefor: So their Belief of the&s;e is attended with the committing of them&s;elves to Him, to be &s;aved in His own Way, and a firm reliance upon Him as able and willing to perform all the kind Offices for them which are included in the Character of a Savior."</P>
<P N="3">3. FAITH in Chri&s;t is productive of new Obedience.</P>
<P>THIS will ever be exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e who believe in Je&s;us, and whenever this Obedience is wanting, Mankind may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, they are mi&s;taken, notwith&s;tand|ing all their Pretences.</P>
<P>THEREFORE was it, that the Apo&s;tle directs Titus (that his Hearers might not be deceived in &s;o important a Matter) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus III. 8.</NOTE> "to affirm it (not tran&s;iently but) con|&s;tantly, that they who have believed in

God be careful to maintain good Works." He &s;uppo&s;ed this mu&s;t be &s;o, if they had true Belief. And thus is it el&s;ewhere repre|&s;ented. Thus, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom.

And put no Difference between us and them, purifying their Hearts by Faith.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts XV. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>FAITH, REPENTANCE, CHRISTIAN OBEDIENCES, HOLINESS, LIKENESS to God, &amp;c. though variou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed, are but one and the &s;ame Thing. There can|not be one without the other. He who truly and properly believes in Chri&s;t, does
<PB N="30" REF="012709_0034_0F8B8E4179F4EA00">
&s;incerely repent of his Sins, and if there is Time for it, heartily endeavors by the Grace of God to render an Obedience to all His Precepts.</P>
<P>AND I find it ob&s;erved by Writers on the Subject of Faith, that where it is men|tioned as a Condition of Salvation, it denotes not only a naked A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of this Propo&s;ition; that He is the Son of God, and the Me&s;&s;enger of God's Mind and Will to the World, and the Savior of Sinners; but that it includes al&s;o whatever is naturally con&s;equent thereunto. For thus&punc; &s;ay they, it is very ordinary with the Scripture to expre&s;s the natural Effects and Con&s;equences by their Cau&s;es. This is the Love of God, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle John,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Epi&s;t. V. 3.</NOTE> that we keep his Commandments. Whereas in Strictne&s;s of &s;peaking, our keeping His Commandments, is only the Effect or Con|&s;equence of loving Him. So &s;ays the wi&s;e Man.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. VIII. 13.</NOTE> The Fear of the Lord is to hate
<PB N="31" REF="012709_0035_0F8B8E41A37558C8">
Evil, whereas indeed this is only the Effect or Con&s;equence of the Fear of the Lord. And thus by knowing, and hearing, and remembring of God; the Scripture u&s;ually expre&s;&s;es the con&s;equent Effects of them. And &s;o al&s;o Faith or believing, when it is u&s;ed as connected with eternal Life, mu&s;t always imply it's natural Effects and Con&s;e|quents: i. e. &s;incere and univer&s;al Obedience to tho&s;e Rules of holy Living which the Go&s;pel pre&s;cribes: For this is the mo&s;t na|tural Effect of our believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John V. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Who&s;oever believes that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t is born of God, i. e. who&s;oever &s;o believes the Truth of this Propo&s;ition as to practi&s;e upon it, and govern his Life and Actions according to the Tenor and Direction of it, is truly a Child of God. For he who believes Chri&s;t to be the Me&s;&s;ias, but continues ob&s;tinately di&s;obe|dient to his Laws, is &s;o far from being a Child of God, that he thereby becomes ten Times more a Child of the Devil. For,
<PB N="32" REF="012709_0036_0F8B8E42434C0E20">
&s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. XIII. 2.</NOTE> If I have all Faith and have not Charity, I am Nothing. For, &s;ays he again, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. V. 6.</NOTE> For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither Circumci&s;ion availeth any Thing or Uncir|cumci&s;ion, but Faith which worketh by Love. And what he means by this, he tells us, Gal. VII. 16. Circumci&s;ion is Nothing and Uncircumci&s;ion is Nothing but the new Creature. And what he means by this, he tells us, 1 Cor. VII. 9. Circumci&s;ion is Nothing and Uncircum|ci&s;ion is Nothing but keeping the Com|mandments of God. So that the only Thing which is genuine and will be advan|tageous&punc; is Faith working by Love. Faith working by Love is the new Creature, and the new Creature is keeping the Command|ments of God.</P>
<P>THIS then may &s;erve to correct the Mi&s;takes of tho&s;e who place the whole of &s;aving Faith upon a bare Dependance on Chri&s;t for Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="012709_0037_0F8B8E43C0F7A288">HOW many are there that have, and will have no other Conception of it? And it is to be feared, flatter them&s;elves to their Ruin and De&s;truction.

There can be no true Faith in Chri&s;t without believing in His Go&s;pel, and in His whole Character as therein repre&s;ented; &s;o neither can there be this, without an Obedience to His Injunctions.

"Repent and turn from your evil Ways, &s;o Iniquity &s;hall not prove your Ruin." "Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved." And how ear|ne&s;tly are Men threatned, when pur&s;uing the contrary Conduct?&mdash;"That if they will not repent, they &s;hall be de&s;troyed," "That he that believeth not is condemned already. He that believeth not the Son &s;hall not &s;ee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him."</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o incumbent on us to be active in the Affair of our Salvation, in Reference to the Rule of final Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="012709_0047_0F8B93CEC2085ED8">THAT there will be a Day of Judgment, mu&s;t be evident to us from our own Make and Con&s;titution. Man has a Spirit formed within him, &s;omething that directs him, who&s;e Faculties are capacious, and are de|&s;igned for Continuance. He is capable of forming proper Judgment of Things, and knowing the Nature of Actions; of recol|lecting and reviewing Things pa&s;t, and looking forward in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to tho&s;e that are future, their Effects and Con&s;e|quences. He mu&s;t therefore be accounta|ble, and was de&s;igned to be judged.</P>
<P>THE Force and Apprehen&s;ions of our Con&s;ciences prove it to us. The Unea&s;ine&s;s or Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the Commi&s;&s;ion of a good or bad Action, and this when Actions are &s;ecreted from the Knowledge of all Mankind; and which mu&s;t be owing to a &s;ecret Foreboding or Pre&s;age, that they mu&s;t hereafter account for the Sin com|mitted.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="012709_0048_0F8B93D0F8EC0198">THE Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. The unequal Di&s;tribution of Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments. And the Revelation God has afforded, do al&s;o fully point it out. It is declared, "That Men are once to die, and after Death the Judgment&mdash;That God has appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that Man whom He hath ordained; whereof He hath given A&s;&s;urance unto all Men, in that He hath rai&s;ed Him from the Dead."</P>
<P>IF then there is to be this Judgment, there mu&s;t be &s;ome Rule, by which God will proceed in the final Determination. Now the Apo&s;tle Paul declares, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. I. 16.</NOTE> "that God will judge the Secrets of Men by Chri&s;t Je&s;us according to the Go&s;pel." The Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t then is the Rule whereby Men are to be judged.

<P>GOD be&s;tows temporal Ble&s;&s;ings when and where he plea&s;es. He cau&s;es it to rain upon one city and not on another; favor|ing &s;ome Men with outward Pro&s;perity, and cau&s;ing Adver&s;ity to be the Lot of others. He is not accountable herein; He has a right to be&s;tow his Favors and Ble&s;&s;ings as He &s;ees fit.</P>
<P>BUT now in judging Men in order to reward or puni&s;h, He acts differently. He views their Character and State; the Ad|vantages
<PB N="46" REF="012709_0050_0F8B93D1C2B2CFA8">
they have had, and the Di&s;advan|tages they have labored under. He acts by the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom and im|partial Ju&s;tice, not by capricious or arbi|trary Power. Every Man mu&s;t receive according to the Things done in the Body. God we &s;ee, it is &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle, is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons. He that hath &s;inned without Law, &s;hall peri&s;h without Law; and he that hath &s;inned in the Law, &s;hall be judged by it. If we &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, we overthrow our natural Notions of Him, and indeed all Revelation. It therefore cannot be.</P>
<P>TO whom then much is given&mdash;much is required&mdash;much is expected; and to whom little is given, the one Talent; if that is properly improved, no more is de|manded. And herein the infinite Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God are manife&s;ted; that He deals with Men as He has capacitated them, afforded them Knowledge; and as they have improved. i. e. He deals with
<PB N="47" REF="012709_0051_0F8B93D2A6F92858">
them as rational, accountable Creatures, and will reward them as &s;uch. Somewhat there|fore mu&s;t be done in order to his finally proceeding with them.</P>
<P>AND this is requi&s;ite in Reference to the divine Authority and Perfections.</P>
<P>THERE is a Harmony of the divine Attributes in the Salvation of Men. They all act in Concert in this grand Affair. One is not exerted at the Expence of the other, but All unite. But now, were there No|thing to be done by Men, Infinite Wi&s;dom would be called in Que&s;tion. The divine Purity and Holine&s;s would be taxed: The infinite Truth and Faithfulne&s;s would be doubted.</P>
<P>THE Wi&s;dom of God is con&s;picuous in contriving &s;uch an Expedient as He has, to reconcile the divine Ju&s;tice and Mercy together, when our Iniquities had &s;et them at Variance. He has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed all Things

as that they mu&s;t ultimately redound to his Glory and the Good of Men. "Here|in He hath abounded in all Wi&s;dom and Prudence:" but certainly this would not appear, it mu&s;t defeat it&s;elf, if Men might be indulged in Sloth and Negligence; and would be &s;ubver&s;ive of their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>GOD is Holy. Holine&s;s is e&s;&s;ential to his Nature. To de&s;troy Sin and make Men like to Him, He &s;ent his Son. And 'till that Image which has been de&s;troyed by Sin is renewed, Men are incapable of the Enjoyment of Him. But might they be idle and carele&s;s, would it not appear as though God was indifferent about it, or connived at it? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm L. 21.</NOTE> "Thou thoughte&s;t I was altogether &s;uch an one as thy&s;elf: But I will reprove thee."</P>
<P>SUCH is the Ju&s;tice of God, that He &s;everely animadverts on tho&s;e who tran&s;|gre&s;s his Laws; and He mu&s;t govern All

with the greate&s;t Impartiality. He has declared that He will. And his Ways and Judgments are true and righteous. "He will puni&s;h the World for their Evil, and the Wicked for their Iniquity. The righ|teous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his Countenance doth behold the Upright." And therefore it mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary, if we believe this, to endeavor to for&s;ake Sin and live to God. If we think otherwi&s;e, how can we &s;uppo&s;e God to be indeed as He is de&s;cribed?</P>
<P>GOD mu&s;t be an all-perfect Being: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute Rectitude. Every Perfection mu&s;t agree. Did they not, He would &s;ink in his Character, and of Con&s;e|quence cea&s;e to be God. So that, upon the whole, the Truth of the Ob&s;ervation mu&s;t appear. We have Nothing to do by Way of Merit and Claim, but Something mu&s;t be done in the Way of Duty, as we are intelligent, accountable Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="012709_0054_0F8B93D522E0B218">WE may therefore adore and prai&s;e that Being who has thus conducted. The Method He has appointed is con&s;i&s;tent with his moral Government, and the State of Men as fallen, but as rational&mdash;As under Obligations to improve their Faculties, to &s;erve and obey Him. In this Way his Grace is honored. There is Nothing in|con&s;i&s;tent with his Perfections, and no En|couragement is given to the Corruption or Inactivity of Man. We are therefore to re|verence his Name and render Him Thanks.</P>
<P>WE al&s;o &s;ee that it is not for us to &s;tand &s;till and expect Salvation.</P>
<P>GOD we find expects and requires Some|thing of us; He has therefore given Means for our Improvement. They are admirably adapted to the Purpo&s;e, and it is ordinarily in the U&s;e of the&s;e that He meets with Men, ble&s;&s;es and enables them to believe to the &s;aving of their Souls. If they reject them, they can have no Rea&s;on to expect God

will appear for them, but that they mu&s;t be given over to Blindne&s;s of Mind, and Hardne&s;s of Heart, and die in their Sins.</P>
<P>AND whatever Men in Health, and while engaged in the World, may think, yet it is certain, when they come to quit the Scene, and Eternity opens to their View, their Conceptions in the general are different. I believe it is &s;eldom that one goes out of the World, if he has his Sen&s;es, but blames Him&s;elf for not doing more than he has: Either that he has not prayed to God at all, or not enough, or that he has not attend|ed on his Wor&s;hip and Ordinances, or not with that Devotion and Sincerity he ought. But why &s;hould Men, when going out of Life, di&s;tre&s;s them&s;elves with the&s;e Things, if they were needle&s;s, if it mattered not whether they were done; and were of no Con&s;equence to Salvation and Happine&s;s? The Mind of Man thus mi&s;giving is a &s;trong Evidence that we ought to be work|ing out our Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="012709_0056_0F8B93D99FE42770">MEN therefore are not to be inactive. If they per&s;wade them&s;elves that they may, and their Lives are agreeable to this Per&s;wa&s;ion, they are undone, and that forever.</P>
<P>GOD has been plea&s;ed to &s;end his Son into the World to die: Salvation is to be &s;ought for only through Him. A Man mu&s;t then labor earne&s;tly after it. And though his Diligence is not the Ground and Foundation of his Acceptance with God, as I have &s;aid, and do always preach, yet or|dinarily Nothing will avail without.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e then who have Ground to hope, they know and believe in the only true God and in his beloved Son, &s;ee that they endeavor to grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t. To this End they &s;hould often reflect on future un&s;een Things. Knowing that "Faith is the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not &s;een:" and labor to have their
<PB N="53" REF="012709_0057_0F8B93DA62924010">
Souls more affected with them than with the Vanities of the World. They &s;hould be much in Prayer to God for the A&s;&s;i&s;tances of his Spirit, not be a&s;hamed to own their Weakne&s;s; but be diligently &s;eeking for that Strength they need. By this Means they will be making con&s;tant Advances in Religion. The Evidences of their Salva|tion and Happine&s;s will be &s;tronger and clearer. Their Difficulties will le&s;&s;en. They will find God "a Sun and a Shield, and that He will withhold no good Thing from them."</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e who are yet in their Sins, be excited to throw off their Sluggi&s;hne&s;s. Be not di&s;couraged from the Difficulty of the Work. Con&s;ider God's Grace is all|&s;ufficient, and that He is ready to afford it, if you &s;incerely and heartily de&s;ire it. Think not that the &s;ecuring the Happine&s;s of your immortal Souls is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Minute, an Hour or Day; but mu&s;t be the Work of your Lives. That is little
<PB N="54" REF="012709_0058_0F8B93DAB9F56ED0">
enough, and yet enough if improved aright. Cry to Him therefore for his Grace, that ye be not De&s;pi&s;ers of the Salvation offered, and made known in the Go&s;pel; and &s;o e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment threatned therein, and which will be inflicted on tho&s;e who mu&s;t in the great Day be judged by, and have rejected it. You have every Thing to invite you. O then "take hold of God's Strength and eternal Life is before you."</P>
<P>THE THIRD AND LAST OBSERVA|TION I make from the Words is, That our Salvation is what above all Things we ought to be concerned for.</P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall endeavor to &s;how&mdash;When we may be &s;aid to be above all Things concerned for our Salvation&mdash;and then why we &s;hould be thus concerned.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN we may be &s;aid to be above all Things concerned for our Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="012709_0059_0F8B93DB85205508">NOW this is &s;o when it dwells mo&s;t fre|quently upon the Mind, we give the greate&s;t Attention to, are chiefly inqui&s;itive about it, and prefer it to every Thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>MAN is a compound Being, con&s;i&s;ting of Soul and Body; and as the Natures of each are different, &s;o are their De&s;ires and Aims. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Faculty of collecting in &s;ome Mea&s;ure his Thoughts, and governing his Imagination, fixing the Mind upon tho&s;e Things that will enoble and profit Him; and an&s;wer the End of his Being. For as &s;oon as Men give way to Thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and Vice is predomi|nant, they forget the De&s;ign of their Being &mdash;what they are&mdash;what they were made for; and put them&s;elves upon an Equality with the brutal Creation.</P>
<P>NOW proper Attention to any Thing is an Application of Mind, according to it's Nature and Importance, thereby to become acquainted with, and have clearer
<PB N="56" REF="012709_0060_0F8B93DDB2836D50">
Apprehen&s;ions of it. And when Men are &s;ollicitous about their Salvation, they will endeavor rightly to con&s;ider, ponder and weigh it with the utmo&s;t Impartiality, that thereby they may &s;ecure it, their Lives be|come duly influenced; and they may act in Conformity to that, to which it would per&s;wade them. Man being a rational thinking Creature, is to be principally go|verned by his Thoughts; and they will be engaged in tho&s;e Things he has the &s;tronge&s;t Inclination to, and takes the greate&s;t Satisfaction in. And if Men are made &s;en&s;ible of the great Worth and Im|portance of Salvation, they will be mo&s;t thoughtful and inqui&s;itive concerning it.</P>
<P>THIS will lead them to be afraid of mi&s;&s;ing it, to guard again&s;t tho&s;e Things that will endanger, and to pur&s;ue tho&s;e that will tend to further and promote it.</P>
<P>SALVATION is a great Thing, not &s;o ea&s;y a Matter as Many may imagine it to be.
<PB N="57" REF="012709_0061_0F8B93DE1AED14E8">
Our Lord tells us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. VII. 14.</NOTE> "Wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to De|&s;truction, and Many there be that go in thereat: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the Gate and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and Few there be that find it."</P>
<P>WE have indwelling Lu&s;t and Corruption to grapple with. A Law in our Members warring again&s;t the Law of our Minds, and bringing us into Captivity to the Law of Sin. We have certain Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions implanted within us, which in them&s;elves are Good, but which are not always re|&s;trained. They are capable of, and often are wrought upon and turned into different Cour&s;es, and upon different Objects, con|trary to our Rea&s;on and the Word of God. It requires great Pains and Vigilance to keep them in due Subjection: And the breaking out and indulging them is the Grief of good Men, and is acknowledged by them. "The Good I would, &s;ays the

Apo&s;tle Paul, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. VII. 19.</NOTE> I do not, but the Evil which I would not, that I do." And All mu&s;t find, that when they would do Good, Evil is pre&s;ent with them. This then is not an ea&s;y Thing. If we give way, &s;uffer them to get the A&s;cendancy, it is certain we cannot be &s;aved; and to get the entire Ma&s;tery over them, we &s;hall find it difficult.</P>
<P>WE are al&s;o expo&s;ed to the Sollicitations of evil Spirits. They &s;urround us with innumerable. Temptations, are inveterate Enemies that mu&s;t con&s;tantly be oppo&s;ed. The&s;e the Scripture informs us were once holy and happy, but are now quite the rever&s;e. They rebelled again&s;t their Ma|ker and Sovereign, and were bani&s;hed the Regions of Light and Bli&s;s. Their Pride is di&s;appointed, and they indu&s;triou&s;ly la|bor to deceive and ruin Man, who by the Grace of God may obtain that Happine&s;s which they can never expect. Agreeable to this is that of the Apo&s;tle Peter, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. V. 8.</NOTE>

Your Adver&s;ary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, goeth about &s;eeking whom he may devour. Now when Men have &s;uch powerful and &s;ubtle Adver&s;aries, it requires great Re&s;olution and Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. "Whom re&s;i&s;t &s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith;" the Expre&s;&s;ion implies in it Difficulty: There is Need of great Circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>AND Mankind are conver&s;ant with &s;en|&s;ible Objects. They are u&s;ed to Sen&s;e, and readily follow it's Perceptions. The Objects pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and have a &s;ur|prizing Force and Influence. And the&s;e they &s;ee. But it is not thus with the Re|ward of Salvation. That is Spiritual and is at a Di&s;tance; is principally to be enjoyed hereafter. We are therefore apt to "look at the Things which are &s;een, but not at the Things which are not &s;een; for the Things which are &s;een are temporal, but the Things which are not &s;een are eternal."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="012709_0064_0F8B93E003736088">AND then if we con&s;ider how exten&s;ive and univer&s;al is our Duty, if we would be really religious; how much is included in, and will follow that Belief which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Saving of our Souls: That every Action of Man is to be regarded; that "He that offends in one Point is guilty of All," it mu&s;t be difficult. There would be no great Difficulty in being &s;aved, if Men might indulge one Sin and di&s;card the other, perform this Duty and neglect that. But this he is not, nor can be al|lowed.

<P>NOW tho&s;e who are above all Things concerned for their Salvation, are &s;en&s;ible of this. It leads them to be on their Guard, and to endeavor their utmo&s;t, that they may not finally mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>THEY labor to know them&s;elves, what are their prevailing Vices and Temptations, and to lay a&s;ide every Weight and the Sin

They pre&s;s on with all their Might, toward the Prize, toward that Heaven "which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for them by his Blood, which the Spirit of God prepares them for; and to which God ince&s;&s;antly calls and invites them."</P>
<P>THEY endeavor to &s;oar above the de|lu&s;ive Amu&s;ements of a vain tran&s;itory World; and to think of another and better Happine&s;s.. It is but a little, it is true, that they know at pre&s;ent, but enough for their Encouragement; they keep it in their Eye, and it quickens them.</P>
<P>THEY know they have their Duties and various Departments&mdash;that it is the Duty of All, the Work of every One, to take Care of his Soul, to be fitted for that

<P>AND finally, having the highe&s;t Concern for their Salvation, they will readily part with all their Intere&s;t in this World, rather than forego their Intere&s;t in the other.</P>
<P>THEY are fully &s;en&s;ible of, and believe what Chri&s;t has declared, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. X. 37.</NOTE> that "He that loveth Father or Mother more than Him

<P>AND this was indeed verified in the Apo&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians. They renounced All, underwent the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries, &s;ubmitted to all Manner of Tor|ments, hazarded their Lives, gave them up for the Sake of propagating that Religion, the Belief of which would &s;ave their Souls and tho&s;e of others.</P>

<P>IF therefore Men would e&s;cape this, and go to Heaven when they die; they mu&s;t &s;ee, they are &s;avingly acquainted with Chri&s;t, have &s;ecured an Intere&s;t in Him who is the great Savior of Sinners; their Souls enlightened in the Knowledge of Him and &s;anctified by his Grace.</P>
<P>AND there is Nothing that is worthy the like Notice or Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="012709_0071_0F8B93EAA11E64C0">A DESIRE of Good, of Happine&s;s, is implanted in the Con&s;titution of human Nature; this All agree in, though they differ in the Thing it&s;elf and in the Means of obtaining it.</P>
<P>NOW all temporal Happine&s;s is un&s;ati&s;|factory in it's Nature, and fleeting and tran|&s;itory. This is apt to engro&s;s the Faculties of the Soul, and by Rea&s;on of it's Weak|ne&s;s and Imperfection it readily catches at it. But when gratified is di&s;appointed, and is &s;till to &s;eek an Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT could it be found herein, yet our own Experience &s;hews us, that every Thing here is of a tran&s;itory Nature, appears but a little while and then vani&s;hes. Riches take to them&s;elves Wings and flee away. Friends leave us; They mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Stroke of Death. All the Enjoyments of Time and Sen&s;e will have an End. And it is upon this Con&s;ideration, (upon the Vanity, Uncertainty, and little Dependance

there is to be had on Men and Things of the World) that we are exhorted to re|nounce our Dependance upon, and check that Satisfaction Men are apt to have in them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. CXLVI. 3, 4.</NOTE> Put not your Tru&s;t in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no Help; his Breath goeth forth and he returneth to his Earth. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Col.

But now if Salvation is &s;e|cured to us we &s;hall enjoy an Happine&s;s &s;uited to our Souls, and which &s;hall know no End, but be growing, and increa&s;ing through all Eternity. So that upon the whole, this is what above all Things we ought to be de&s;irous of and concerned for.</P>
<P>IF it be then as has been &s;aid, how few are there that are properly concerned for their Salvation?</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="012709_0073_0F8B93EF39D5A230">MANY may not think of it at all. Others may admit it at Times, but do not per&s;e|vere. Though their Attachment to Sin is not wholly &s;ufficient to exclude "at pre|&s;ent," yet great enough to prevent going any Lengths, and &s;o of "finally" excluding it.</P>
<P>THEY perhaps have &s;et out with Warmth and Zeal, re&s;olutely bent upon for&s;aking Sin and living to God; but this has been but of &s;hort Duration. Particular Provi|dences may have affected them (as the Earthquake did the Jailor in the Text) and for a while they felt the Force of their Im|pre&s;&s;ions, but they have gradually abated; they become indifferent about their Sal|vation, at lea&s;t to exerci&s;e that Diligence and Indu&s;try required; and a &s;mall Occa|&s;ion of Temptation will make them give it up. They keep up the Appearance, but can turn them&s;elves into any Shape, when their Intere&s;t requires it; become fickle and incon&s;tant, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no Steadine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="012709_0074_0F8B93F007DA73C8">WE &s;hould then be &s;ollicitous to think properly of this Matter, to guard again&s;t Deception, think of Salvation as it is, what is expected and required; and how unhappy mu&s;t be our Situation without.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then, to exhort you to embrace the Salvation made known and offered in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THIS is tendered to All, to the greate&s;t Sinner as well as the lea&s;t. None may de|&s;pair. However vile and wicked, however they may have de&s;pi&s;ed the Riches of God's Goodne&s;s, Forbearance and Long-Suffering, yet if they have a De&s;ire to return, if they are willing to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t. accept his Offers, they &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be happy. Thus the Apo&s;tle Paul, after mentioning a Num|ber of Vices, tells the Corinthians, "that &s;uch were &s;ome of them," i. e. they had practi&s;ed &s;uch Things. But, &s;ays he, "Ye are wa&s;hed, &s;anctified and ju&s;tified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the Spirit of your God."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="012709_0075_0F8B93F07A4315B8">NOT that a Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Vices would recommend to the divine Favor, but they are mentioned to &s;hew, that none may de&s;pair of the Grace and Mercy of God; that there is a Sufficiency in the Merits of Chri&s;t for the greate&s;t Sinners, if they believe in and obey Him.</P>
<P>NONE thin can make any Objections. "Who&s;oever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life freely. Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the Waters, yea come buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price." Look to Je&s;us whom ye have pierced, and mourn; and let it be your chief Concern to &s;ecure an Intere&s;t in Him.</P>
<P>THINK what God expects of tho&s;e to whom He has afforded great Knowledge. That we are they, who are favored with the Go&s;pel. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malachy IV. 2.</NOTE> The Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s hath ari&s;en upon us with Healing in his Wings." We have the greate&s;t and mo&s;t

important Truths revealed&mdash;Our In&s;uffi|ciency to &s;ave our&s;elves, that God has provided Salvation, wherein He will be appea&s;ed and we ju&s;tified. We have our Duty fully revealed, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Ho|line&s;s, of a Change in Heart and Life&mdash; the Knowledge of the other World made known, it's Rewards and Puni&s;hments. We have the greate&s;t Advantages, Means of Grace afforded, frequent Opportunities of hearing the Word and being in&s;tructed in it. Some of us have publickly and &s;o|lemnly owned our&s;elves the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and Him to be our Lord and Ma&s;ter; and have repeated Sea&s;ons of renewing the Obligations we have laid our&s;elves under. How highly are we favored? lifted to Hea|ven in Point of Privileges&mdash;Privileges im|proveable to eternal Happine&s;s and Glory.</P>
<P>AND now what mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of a Neglect? Can we plead Ignorance, that we are unacquainted with the Way to Life after having enjoyed &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing Favors.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="012709_0077_0F8B93F21A2AFD68">SHALL we plea&s;e our&s;elves, that becau&s;e we have to ea&s;e our Con&s;ciences performed &s;ome Parts of Religion, tho&s;e that are the lea&s;t oppo&s;ite to our favorite Vices, that we &s;hall e&s;cape; or that our Sentence &s;hall be moderated, our Puni&s;hment le&s;&s;ened? In vain are all &s;uch Imaginations. In vain may we think of "gentle Flames:" Con|demnation aggravated mu&s;t be our Portion. Our Wilfulne&s;s will not be over-looked, our Mi&s;ery mu&s;t be accumulated. What Man|ner of Per&s;ons ought we then to be? how concerned that we re&s;t not in any Change, &s;hort of one which is univer&s;al and per|manent.</P>
<P>O LET us be excited to improve the Means of Grace and Salvation.</P>
<P>PRAY to God daily and con&s;tantly thro' Chri&s;t. This is an Act wherein we ex|pre&s;s our Dependance, that our Condition is imperfect; and that our Reliance mu&s;t be

on God For All we want. And as we have Time allotted for the public Wor&s;hip and Service of God, we ought to embrace the Opportunities for our Attendance, not be ab&s;ent, let &s;mall Things divert us from it. This no Doubt is a great, an happy Means of advancing the Honor and Glory of God, and promoting the Salvation of the Souls of Men, therefore it mu&s;t be incum|bent on All; Every Man is obliged by his Example to &s;upport the Solemnity and Credit of it; and they contract Guilt who wilfully and cau&s;ele&s;sly neglect it.</P>
<P>WE are favored with the Ordinances of God's Hou&s;e, and it is nece&s;&s;ary we improve them, and endeavor to an&s;wer their End.</P>
<P>PARENTS &s;hould give up their Children to God in Bapti&s;m, and when they do, they ought to under&s;tand it's De&s;ign and their Obligations.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="012709_0079_0F8B93F518A1B5B8">AN Attendance on the other Ordinance is the Duty of Men. They are to &s;ee their Views and De&s;igns are good, and labor to reap it's Benefit. When they con&s;ider what glorious Things are intended, and therein pre&s;ented to their View, it &s;hould inkindle a Flame of divine Love in their Souls, and excite them to make the mo&s;t &s;uitable Returns.</P>
<P>IN a Word, we &s;hould All humbly ca&s;t our&s;elves on the Mercy of God, and intreat Him for his Goodne&s;s Sake in Chri&s;t Je&s;us to have Compa&s;&s;ion on us, and by his Grace and Spirit "&s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h our Hearts and direct our Ways, that having cho&s;en the good Part, we may never relinqui&s;h it."</P>
<P>AND thus have I fini&s;hed the Subject I have been &s;ome Time upon. I have not labored for a nice Arrangement of Words, for Poli&s;h or Ornament. My De&s;ign has been, with the greate&s;t Plainne&s;s, and I hope I can &s;ay, with Sincerity and Faithfulne&s;s,

<P>MAY Saints be built up in their mo&s;t holy Faith, and Sinners quickned in their Enquiry "what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved."</P>
<P>O MAY we All endeavor in the &s;everal Places and Relations in which God has fixed us, to re&s;tore and increa&s;e vital Religion, promote it's Reputation by our countenanc|ing it. Then might we hope God would pour out his Spirit upon us and his Ble&s;&s;ing. He would own us as His, give evident Tokens of his Favor; and receive us to dwell with Him for ever.</P>
