<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>DR. Chandler propo&s;es, at the clo&s;e of his defence, (p. 266) 'that the debate be reduced within a narrower compa&s;s, and that nothing that does not immediately re|late to the merits of the cau&s;e be offered on either &s;ide.' Had he made this propo|&s;al, when he undertook to open the plan for an American epi&s;copate, &s;aying nothing but what directly tended to give it admi&s;&s;ion in|to the mind as rea&s;onable, he would at once have le&s;&s;ened my labour, and prevented the tre&s;pa&s;s that has been committed upon the patience of tho&s;e who have been our rea|ders. If, in his 'appeal,' in my 'an|&s;wer' to it, and in his 'defence' of it, ma|ny pages are filled with have no more relati|on to an 'American Epi&s;copate,' than the di&s;pute 'whether Aaron's linnen Ephod was of blue, or a &s;ea-water-green,' the Doctor very well knows where the blame ought to be laid. No one would have thought it an a&s;per&s;ion, if he had taken it wholly to him&s;elf. The limitation he propo|&s;es though proper at fir&s;t, does not <HI>now</HI> wear &s;o equitable an a&s;pect, at lea&s;t, as coming from him. He has taken the fulle&s;t liberty, not
<PB N="vi" REF="011598_0004_0F877A42621AF8E8">
only in his 'appeal,' but in his 'vindica|tion' of it; and now he would re&s;train others, keeping them within tho&s;e bounds he has leaped over, and putting it out of their power to remark upon the greate&s;t part of what he has been plea&s;ed to offer. This does not look fair. However, from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of that re&s;pect which is due to the Publick, I &s;hall endeavour to make the tryal of their patience as light as may be; &s;till depending &s;o far upon their candor, as to &s;ay what may be nece&s;&s;ary in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, though it &s;hould not always imme|diately relate to the grand point in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>THE Doctor further propo&s;es, "that no invective or abu&s;e, nothing that &s;avors of bigotry or barbarity, be &s;uffered to mingle in the debate; but that ingenuous, &s;ober rea&s;oning &s;hould decide it." He would have made this propo&s;al with a better grace, if he had more fully exemplified, in his own conduct, what he has here recomended. It is true, his air in writing &s;ometimes car|ries the appearance of candor and mildne&s;s; nor is it generally mi&s;becoming the gentle|man, or the chri&s;tian. But will any pre|tend, that his manner is not too often very like their's who are actuated by a &s;pirit of 'bigotry?' Has he no where treated his opponents with 'invective and abu&s;e?' Are there no in&s;tances, in which he has had re|cour&s;e to eva&s;ive art, rather than &s;olid argu|ment? Has he never &s;ub&s;tituted popular exclamation in the room of good rea&s;oning?
<PB N="vii" REF="011598_0004_0F877A42621AF8E8">
Do we never find him 'di&s;ingenuou&s;ly' en|deavouring to make others think he has an|&s;wered powerfully, when he him&s;elf knew he had &s;aid nothing to the purpo&s;e? Nay, has he never &s;o di&s;honoured his own character as only to laugh loud, when &s;o pre&s;&s;ed as to be unable to make a ju&s;t or &s;ober reply? The intelligent reader, I doubt not, has ob|&s;erved in&s;tances in all the&s;e kinds; and we &s;hall have occa&s;ion, in proper time and place, to hold them up to publick view. After all, the propo&s;al here made is not objected to, &s;o far as I am concerned in it. I e&s;teem it a chri&s;tian as well as rea&s;onable rule of conduct, and &s;hall accordingly endeavour to govern my&s;elf by it in what may follow. Should the Doctor think fit to write again, it will be eminently proper in him not to forget to do him&s;elf, as he propo&s;es that others &s;hould do in this debate. I would advi&s;e him to bear it habitually on his mind, that Epi&s;co|palians as truly as other denominations of chri&s;tians, may be &s;o &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed in fa|vor of their own &s;ide, as to be equally in|capable of perceiving the force of the mo&s;t powerful argument; and that it may, with as much truth, be &s;aid of them, that 'in &s;eeing they will not &s;ee,' and 'in hearing they will not under&s;tand.'</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it impertinent to &s;ubjoin here, that it ought not to be looked upon as any fault of mine, if the reader &s;hould be detained from the GRAND POINT in di&s;pute, longer than he might

rea&s;onably expect. I chu&s;e particularly to mention this, that the Doctor may be up|on his guard for time to come, and not act &s;o unfair a part as to endeavour to fa&s;ten that blame, in this re&s;pect, upon others, which he only, in ju&s;tice, is accountable for; as he has put them upon taking notice of what he has &s;aid that is fo|reign to the MAIN SUBJECT, or to pa&s;s it over as impertinent.</P>
<P>I now go on to offer what I have to &s;ay in reply to the Doctor's 'defence;' and in the doing of it, I &s;hall follow the order in which he has given us his thoughts.</P>

<HEAD>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Introductory Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>HE complains bitterly, in this part of his defence, e&s;pecially of the MANNER, in which he has been oppo&s;ed. As I am not the named per&s;on again&s;t whom the&s;e complaints are made, and feel within my &s;elf a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not having given any ju&s;t occa&s;ion for them, it would be impertinent in me to remark upon them. The <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel,</HI> who are particularly pointed out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e evidenced to the world their ability to vindicate them&s;elves; and, it is probable, the Doctor will hear from them, if they &s;hould think it worth while to take notice of the charges he has exhibited again&s;t them. I would not be taxed with officiou&s;ly going out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my own line to do that which is the pro|per bu&s;ine&s;s of others, and for the doing of which they are much better qualified than I can pretend to be.</P>
<P>NONE of the Doctor's ob&s;ervations have any &s;pecial reference to me, until we come to the la&s;t, which he calls "a mo&s;t mate|rial one," and to which he "reque&s;ts the attention of every reader." I al&s;o, in my turn, could make a reque&s;t. It is only this rea&s;onable one, that the reader, while he attends to the Doctor's "mo&s;t material ob&s;er|vation," would impartially con&s;ider what may be offered, wherein it relates to me, in an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>AFTER a 'dead &s;ilence,' for a while, as
<PB N="10" REF="011598_0006_0F877A44730A7B88">
to any 'di&s;&s;atisfaction' relative to the plan that had been propo&s;ed, 'it was at length di&s;covered (&s;ays the Doctor) that a number of per&s;ons had entered into a combination to run down the appeal, and vigorou&s;ly to oppo&s;e, at any rate, the re&s;idence of Bi&s;hops in America.' The combination he here &s;peaks of, with as po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance as though he him&s;elf had been an a&s;&s;ociate, has not, tak|ing me into it, the lea&s;t foundation in truth; but is wholly a phantom of his own imagination. I never heard of a '&s;ettled plan of operation,' in which I was to bear a part, and make what, the Doctor &s;ays, 'may, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, be called a regular attack upon the appeal,' till I had this information of it from him. The hone&s;t truth is, I undertook to an&s;wer the appeal, becau&s;e I could hear of no one at New-York, Philadel|phia, or in any part of New-England, who ap|peared di&s;po&s;ed to engage in this work. Had I then known what the Doctor &s;ays was 'at length di&s;covered,' I &s;hould certainly have &s;tood by a &s;pectator only. As it had been publi&s;hed, 'that if no objections were offered again&s;t the propo&s;|ed american Epi&s;copate, it would be taken for granted all parties were &s;atisfied,' I was unwill|ing <HI>total &s;ilence</HI> &s;hould be con&s;trued an argument of <HI>general &s;atisfaction,</HI> when I knew nothing was more contrary to the truth; and it was for this &s;pecial rea&s;on that I entred upon an affair, which I &s;aid, in the adverti&s;ement to my an&s;wer, 'would expo&s;e me to much ill will.' This has been &s;hamefully verified &s;ince by the &s;currilous treatment I have met with in &s;ome of the New-York periodical papers, occa&s;i|oned by my attempting to comply with an epi&s;|copal de&s;ire publickly made known; although
<PB N="11" REF="011598_0006_0F877A44730A7B88">
the <HI>manner</HI> in which it was done has been com|plained of by &s;ome as over-mild and candid.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the Doctor's imaginary plan of operation, a furious on&s;et has been made on the harmle&s;s well-meant appeal, be|gun by Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> in 'regular form,' and &s;upported by the <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel</HI> in 'week|ly &s;kirmi&s;hes,' in which they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by 'occa&s;ional &s;allies of a number of volun|tiers,' and the whole performed with 'as much &s;pirit and warmth as the friends of the&s;e adventurers could wi&s;h.' And what was the &s;ucce&s;s? Shockingly bad on the &s;ide of its opponents! For, &s;ays the Doctor, 'notwith|&s;tanding all their re&s;olution, alertne&s;s, and cau|tion, they have been obliged to give up the grand object of the conte&s;t as above explain|ed.' And here he particularly brings me in as giving up this grand point in di&s;pute. Says he, 'Dr. Chauncy declares for him&s;elf and his brethren (p. 180) in the following words; <HI>We de&s;ire no other liberty, than to be left unre&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of our religious principles, in &s;o far as we are good members of &s;ociety. And we are perfectly willing Epi&s;|copalians &s;hould enjoy this liberty to the full. If they think Bi&s;hops, in their appropriated &s;en&s;e, were con&s;tituted by</HI> CHRIST, <HI>or his apo&s;|tles, we object not a word again&s;t their hav|ing as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be content to have them with</HI> AUTHORI|TY ALTOGETHER DERIVED FROM CHRIST.' So again, in p. 189, '<HI>It is not</HI> SIMPLY <HI>the exerci&s;e of any of their religious principles that would give the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, nor yet the exerci&s;e of them under as many</HI> PURELY SPI|RITUAL <HI>Bi&s;hops as they would wi&s;h to have;
<PB N="12" REF="011598_0007_0F877A45381FA148">
but their having Bi&s;hops under a</HI> STATE E|STABLISHMENT.' The&s;e, it is acknowledg|ed, are my words; but with what truth, or ju&s;tice, the Doctor could &s;ay, they contain that in them which looks like my 'giving up the main point' in debate, is be&s;t known to him&s;elf. He mu&s;t have been &s;trangely inattentive, if he did not perceive, that the Bi&s;hops in his plan, and tho&s;e I &s;pake of, were ESSENTIALLY different, and con&s;equently that I might oppo&s;e the former, while I had no objection again&s;t the latter. What he has here introduced with no &s;mall parade, and pe|remptorily affirmed for truth, amounts to no more than a declaration of the &s;en&s;e he is plea|&s;ed to put upon my words; which &s;en&s;e it may be worthy of notice. I had purpo&s;ely ta|ken care to guard again&s;t, in as explicit a man|ner as I well could. The Bi&s;hops I had 'not a word to object to,' the Bi&s;hops that 'would give no unea&s;ine&s;s,' were particularly de&s;cri|bed as having 'AUTHORITY ALTOGETHER FROM CHRIST,' and as being 'PURELY SPI|RITUAL' Bi&s;hops. The&s;e, the Doctor could not but know, were, in my apprehen&s;ion, quite different from the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed in his plan, and that I had largely endeavoured to &s;how wherein they were &s;o. And yet, at the very entrance upon his defence, and before he had &s;o much as attempted to offer a word in proof that his Bi&s;hops, and tho&s;e I expre&s;&s;ed my approbation of, were the SAME, he would prepo&s;&s;e&s;s his readers with the thought, that this was the real truth; and con&s;equently that I had wrote many &s;cores of pages in oppo&s;i|tion to that, again&s;t which 'I had not a word to object.' Is this 'ingenious?' Would not
<PB N="13" REF="011598_0007_0F877A45381FA148">
the Doctor have done him&s;elf more honour, and his cau&s;e more &s;ervice, if, in a way of '&s;o|ber rea&s;oning,' he had endeavoured to make it evident, that I had acted a weak, ridiculous, and incon&s;i&s;tent part, before he virtually told the world that I had &s;o done. Notwith&s;tand|ing this boa&s;ted a&s;&s;urance, enough was &s;aid in the an&s;wer to the appeal to &s;atisfy any rea|&s;onable man, that the Bi&s;hops propo&s;ed by Dr. Chandler, and tho&s;e 'not objected to' by Dr. Chauncy, were as widely different, as this world is from another; and it may hereafter appear, that the a&s;&s;igned rea&s;ons for this difference have not been in the lea&s;t invalidated by any thing the Doctor has offered in his long la|boured defence. He has indeed very &s;ligh|tily pa&s;&s;ed over this MOST ESSENTIAL part of the di&s;pute; though more than once called upon to make out the right of Epi&s;copalians to &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are &s;pecified in his publi&s;h|ed plan. If he would do ju&s;tice to his own character, and promote the cau&s;e he is en|gaged in, he mu&s;t not &s;ub&s;titute arbitrary mi&s;|con&s;truction in the room of &s;olid rea&s;oning, and upon this footing triumphantly a&s;&s;ure his readers, 'the matter being brought to this i&s;&s;ue, he might give up all further controver&s;y.'</P>
<P>THE Doctor, having &s;aid (p. 11) that 'his chief bu&s;ine&s;s was with me,' goes on to 'con|tra&s;t his own diffidence with my gigantic con|fidence.' What gave the occa&s;ion for this? The reader may wonder when I tell him its ri&s;e. The Doctor introduced his appeal by in|forming the Publick, 'that he was appointed to this &s;ervice by the convention of the cler|gy of New-York, and the Jer&s;ies, with &s;ome of their brethren from the neighbouring pro|vinces:'
<PB N="14" REF="011598_0008_0F877A460DC39328">
Whereas, I introduced my an&s;wer to the appeal by &s;aying 'that I could not pretend to &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing honour, but was prevail|ed upon to engage in the cau&s;e by the de&s;ire of private friends only.' The Doctor &s;hrewdly infers herefrom, that he is a man of 'diffi|dence,' but that I am a 'giant for confidence;' for no rea&s;on but becau&s;e I pre&s;umed to en|ter the li&s;t with one &s;o eminently important, as to be &s;elected by a venerable body of the Clergy to write an 'appeal to the Publick.' Some of his readers may po&s;&s;ibly e&s;teem this incen&s;e offered to him&s;elf an illu&s;tration of his &s;ingularly mode&s;t 'diffidence;' but, I am &s;ure, none of them can account his treatment of me a ju&s;t &s;pecimen of that 'ingenious rea&s;oning' &s;tript of all 'abu&s;e,' which he recommends to others in the management of the pre&s;ent di&s;|pute. It would be ea&s;y, becau&s;e it would be natural, by comparing the manner of the Doctor's 'coming forward' with mine, to make repri&s;als, by inverting the order of the contra&s;t he has brought to view; but the occa&s;ion is too trifling, and I an't di&s;po&s;ed to deal in that which may look like returning 'railing for railing.'</P>
<P>I HAD complained, 'that the arguments in &s;upport of the PETITIONS for an American Epi&s;copate had been kept &s;ecret,' and that 'an authentick knowledge of them, though appli|ed for, was rejected." To this the Doctor re|plies (p. 12) 'I know nothing of &s;uch appli|cation, or rejection.' I am di&s;po&s;ed to think, he here wrote as he thought. But, if he had taken time for recollection, it is probable he would have called to mind what he might not then have had in actual remembrance. Did he never hear of a formal application made
<PB N="15" REF="011598_0008_0F877A460DC39328">
by Dr. Stiles in a letter to the Clerk of the New-York convention, de&s;iring a copy of their petitions, e&s;pecially their petition to the King, and of the formal negative put upon this rea&s;onable reque&s;t? Did he never hear of any controver&s;y between the American Whig, and this Clerk of the convention, relative to the petition to the King, wherein he was called upon to put an end to the di&s;pute by producing the words of the petition, which he refu&s;ed to do? The Doctor mu&s;t be a much greater '&s;tranger in I&s;rael' than I took him to be, if he never heard of the&s;e things. Be&s;ides, I could, were it proper, name one member at lea&s;t of this convention who was applied to for a copy of the petition to the King, but in vain. Should the Doctor be ignorant of the&s;e truths, &s;urely his ignorance is no proof that they are not &s;uch. There might have been the 'applications' and 'rejections' com|plained of, though he knew nothing of them. But, &s;ays he, 'the complaint is altogether groundle&s;s; for the plan upon which it was propo&s;ed that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to Ame|rica, and the <HI>arguments</HI> afterwards <HI>made u&s;e of in &s;upport of our petitions,</HI> actually were publi&s;h|ed a con&s;iderable time before the petitions were &s;ent.&mdash;And afterwards it was voted by our convention, that more particular informati|on &s;hould be publi&s;hed, and the whole matter ex|plained, for the &s;atisfaction of all parties; in con|&s;equence of which the appeal was drawn up, and publi&s;hed.' What is all this to the pur|po&s;e? It is true, &s;uch arguments, in &s;upport of the plan for American Bi&s;hops, as were thought fit to be publickly u&s;ed, we have been made acquainted with. But the que&s;|tion
<PB N="16" REF="011598_0009_0F877A469B848A58">
is, are the&s;e the ONLY ones that enforced the petitions that were &s;ent Home? Will the Doctor venture to &s;ay, NO OTHERS w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e u&s;ed? If this is the truth, how comes it to pa&s;s, that the&s;e petitions are &s;ecreted to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s day? If ALL that they contain has been al|ready publi&s;hed, what po&s;&s;ible harm can th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be in giving copies of them? It ought not to be taken ami&s;s, if, in this view of the ca&s;e, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome things are &s;aid, in &s;upport of the&s;e petitions, which the Cler|gy who &s;ent them, are not willing &s;hould be publickly known. It cannot otherwi&s;e be accounted for, that they &s;hould thus &s;tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y refu&s;e a copy of them. If any credit is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the word of a Gentleman of well e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, who was favoured with a &s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, though not with a copy, of one of the&s;e peti|tions, it contained that in it which has ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r been made publick, by any who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;upport of the plan for an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies. I am fully &s;atisfied, in common with many others, that the true cau&s;e, at bot|tom, why we can have no 'authentic know|ledge' of the contents of the&s;e petitions is, their having that in&s;erted in them, which the Epi&s;copal Clergy, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves, do not chu&s;e the publick &s;hould be let into. The Doctor would have acted a more fair and honourable part, if he had plainly &s;aid &s;o, and not endeavoured to turn his readers off with di&s;gui&s;ed amu&s;ement.</P>

<HEAD>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Fir&s;t Section.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;ection he de&s;igned as a defence, in part at lea&s;t, of the '&s;ketch of argu|ments' he had brought to view, in his 'ap|peal,' in favour of Epi&s;copacy in general. It is a pity he put him&s;elf to the trouble of giving us this &s;ketch. I remon&s;trated again&s;t it, in my an&s;wer, p. 14, and for the&s;e rea|&s;ons. The plea, in what he had undertaken, would, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, 'be equally valid, whether the&s;e principles were founded right|ly, or wrongly;' and no valuable end could be an&s;wered by this trouble, unle&s;s to increa&s;e the number of his pages, which would DETAIN his readers from attending to the MAIN POINT he propo&s;ed for debate; and needle&s;sly too, as he gave us only a repetition of arguments that had been before repeated over and over again &s;o as to be even nau&s;eous. He has &s;een fit frankly to acknowledge, defen. p. 77, 'that he was convinced what was &s;aid upon the general &s;ubject, however ju&s;t in it&s;elf, or proper in the|ory, had been better omitted.' And yet, he has wrote no le&s;s than ninety-eight pages (more a great deal than one third part of the whole of what he has offered) in &s;upport of that, concern|ing which he was 'convinced' it had been bet|ter if he had &s;aid nothing. And what is a&s;to|ni&s;hing,
<PB N="18" REF="011598_0010_0F877A478FF0D368">
not being &s;atisfied with barely in&s;inu|ating, he has peremptorily declared, p. 77, that his 'adver&s;aries have eagerly laid hold of a &s;ub|ject which has been already debated for almo&s;t 200 years, and will probably be debated for 200 years to come; by this means keeping the PRIN|CIPAL OBJECT of this controver&s;y, which is an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE, at a di&s;tance, and as much as po&s;&s;ible out of &s;ight.' Who could have imagined, that one who profe&s;&s;es a regard to his own honour and character, could be capable of reflecting blame upon others, not only in an in&s;tance wherein he him&s;elf has been gro&s;sly faul|ty, but wherein the faultine&s;s of others, if in|deed they are at all faulty, is wholly owing to him as its real and only occa&s;ional cau&s;e? Was not the Doctor the very per&s;on, who, by his needle&s;s '&s;ketch of arguments' to &s;upport Epi&s;|copacy in general, 'kept out of &s;ight the grand object in pur&s;uit?' And did he not hereby render it nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who an&s;wered him to do the like, at lea&s;t for a while, and until they might, with allowance from him, bring this object into view?

brings me in making that my CHIEF BUSI|NESS, which was only a &s;mall part of it, and would not indeed have been any part, if he had not un&s;ea&s;onably and needle&s;sly called me to it. The 'other object', which, &s;ays the Doctor, in the next words, 'the curio&s;ity of the Publick called him to pur&s;ue, is an object from which I propo&s;e to be no longer diverted by an endle&s;s di&s;pute concerning Epi&s;copacy.' And yet, if the reader can give credit to it, he has &s;till gone on, in contradiction to his own purpo&s;e, for more than 20 pages; though he had before wrote upon the &s;ame &s;ubject more than 70. Per|haps, when he calmly reflects upon his injudi|cious unfairne&s;s, not to &s;ay incon&s;i&s;tency with him&s;elf, as above opened to him, he may be put to the blu&s;h. It is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould think, he has &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;o 'ingenuous' as might rea&s;onably have been expected: Nor will it, after this, appear any thing &s;trange, if we &s;hould meet with &s;till more gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;en|tations.</P>
<P>THE Doctor introduced the fir&s;t &s;ection in his 'appeal' with ob&s;erving, 'that the church of England is epi&s;copal, and con&s;equently holds the nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops to govern the church, and to confer eccle&s;ia&s;tical orders.' It was &s;aid in an&s;wer, 'that the church of England neither holds, nor is obliged to hold, the DIVINE RIGHT of Bi&s;hops in the appropriated &s;en&s;e, to govern the church, or confer holy orders; and that none of her public offices, or any part of the &s;y&s;tem of her conduct, are founded on this principle.' The Doctor replies, def. p. 16, 'If it be by vir|tue only of the <HI>jus humanum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy that Bi&s;hops are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;till the ends for which they are nece&s;&s;ary cannot be obtained without

them &s;o long as we are &s;ubject to the authority that requires them.' It is at once ea&s;y and &s;uf|ficient to &s;ay here, as the authority requiring is by &s;uppo&s;ition <HI>meerly human,</HI> no complaints can rea&s;onably be made by tho&s;e who could have none to make, if they acknowledged and ho|noured no one but JESUS CHRIST as SU|PREME HEAD of the chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>BUT the JUS DIVINUM of Epi&s;copacy is what the Doctor has all along pleaded for, and it is THIS RIGHT only I ever pretended was not the doctrine of the church of England. And, upon fur|ther examination, in con&s;equence of what the Doc|tor has offered, I am abundantly confirmed in the per&s;ua&s;ion, that this doctrine was never intend|ed to be delivered as her faith, in any of her public offices; no, not in her 'preface to the book of ordination,' which has the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;pect this way. The Doctor thinks the DIVINE RIGHT of Epi&s;copacy is clearly and fully a&s;&s;erted in this preface. Having cited tho&s;e words of it he &s;up|po&s;es make for his purpo&s;e, which I &s;hall throw into the margin, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'It is evident to all men diligently reading holy &s;cripture, and ancient authors, that, from the apo&s;tles time, there have been the&s;e orders of mini&s;ters in CHRIST's church; Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Dea|cons.

But, by its being printed in the Old Engli&s;h letter, it mu&s;t be of ancient date. At the bottom of the title page are the&s;e words 'LON|DON, printed by <HI>Robert Barker</HI> and <HI>John Bill,</HI> Prin|ters to the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty. Upon comparing THIS with the PRESENT ordinal I find, that in conformity to the commi&s;&s;ion granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d to &s;everal Bi&s;hops and other Divines, to review the book of common pray|er, and the book of the form and manner of mak|and con&s;ecrating of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons, and to prepare &s;uch alterations and additions as they thought &s;it to offer, that they did accordingly make and prepare a number of alterations and addi|tions, and &s;ome very momentous ones; which were approved by his Maje&s;ty, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Parliament in the 14th year of his reign. THIS is the ordinal that has been in u&s;e ever &s;ince. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to point out mo&s;t of the&s;e alterations, in marginal notes, upon what may follow. One very material alteration I &s;hall take notice of here. In the OLD ordinal the words, in the preface, are, 'which offices were evermore had in &s;uch reverent e&s;timation, that no man <HI>by his own private authority</HI> might pre&s;ume to execute any of them [the before|mentioned offices] except he were fir&s;t called&mdash;and al&s;o by public prayer and impo&s;ition of hands, ap|proved and admitted thereunto. And therefore, to the intent that the&s;e orders &s;hould be continued, and reverently u&s;ed and e&s;teemed in this church of Eng|land, it is requi&s;ite that no man (not being at this pre&s;ent, Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, nor Deacon) &s;hall execute any of them except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted, according to the form hereafter fol|lowing.' In the NEW, they are thus altered, 'which offices were evermore had in &s;uch reverend e&s;tima|tion, that <HI>no man might pre&s;ume to execute any of them,</HI> except he were fir&s;t called&mdash;and al&s;o by public pray|er and impo&s;ition of hands were approved and admit|ed thereunto <HI>by lawful authority.</HI> And therefore, to the intent&mdash;<HI>no man &s;hall be accounted, or taken to be, a lawful Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, or Deacon, in the church of England, or &s;uffered to execute any of the &s;aid functions,</HI> except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto according to the form hereafter following, <HI>or hath had formerly epi&s;copal con&s;ecration or ordina|tion.</HI>' It is obvious, at fir&s;t &s;ight, according to the PRESENT ordinal, that no man may be looked upon as a LAWFUL mini&s;ter of the church of England, who has not had epi&s;copal ordination; but it it does not appear, that this was the ca&s;e while the OLD or|dinal was in u&s;e.

It is in fact true, that, under the OLD ordinal, tho&s;e were admitted to officiate as mini&s;ters in the church of England, who were not epi&s;copally ordained: whereas, I &s;uppo&s;e, an in&s;tance of this kind cannot be produced &s;ince the 14th of <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd.</NOTE> Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, or Deacon in the

It is true, it accounts no one a LAWFUL Bi&s;hop, or Prie&s;t, or Deacon, of the church of England, unle&s;s admitted to office by LAWFUL authority, in the manner pre&s;cribed.

Does this preface affirm, with the Doc|tor, that the power of <HI>government</HI> and <HI>ordina|tion</HI> are by GOD appropriated to Bi&s;hops, and &s;o appopriated to them as that they ought to be exerci&s;ed by no other, and, if they are, that they have no validitv? Let him, if he can, give the lea&s;t &s;hadow of proof, that this idea was intended to be conveyed as the &s;en&s;e of the church of England. Until he is able to do this, it will be a vain thing in him to pretend, that this is the doctrine of the Engli&s;h church, as held forth in this preface.

In the OLD book, Prie&s;ts were called, in the exhortation, 'Me&s;&s;engers, Watch|men, Stewards, and PASTORS of the Lord;' but in the NEW, the word PASTORS is de&s;ignedly left out, taking from Prie&s;ts the <HI>pa&s;toral power,</HI> and making them little or nothing more than Bi&s;hop's Curates.&mdash; In the OLD the Bi&s;hop a&s;ked the Prie&s;t, whether he did think in his heart, that he was truly called, ac|cording to the will of GOD, and the order of the church of England, to the <HI>mini&s;try</HI> of Prie&s;thood: in the NEW, it is to the ORDER, as well as mini&s;try; making prie&s;thood an order of it&s;elf di&s;tinct from deacon&s;hip and Epi&s;copacy.&mdash;In the OLD, the two Bi&s;hops who pre&s;ent the elected Bi&s;hop to the Arch|bi&s;hop, &s;ay, 'Mo&s;t reverend father in GOD, we pre&s;ent unto you this godly and well learned man to be con&s;ecrated a Bi&s;hop:' In the NEW it is, to be ORDAINED as well as con&s;ecrated; intimating here|by, that he was to be commi&s;&s;ioned to a new, di&s;|tinct, and higher office in the church. In the OLD, that part of the litany was read, which &s;ays, 'that it may plea&s;e thee to illuminate all Bi&s;hops, PAS|TORS, and Mini&s;ters of the 'church with true know|ledge.&mdash;In the NEW, the words are, 'Give grace, we be&s;eech thee to all Bi&s;hops, THE PASTORS OF THY CHURCH;'&mdash;as though none were PASTORS but Bi&s;hops. And whereas, in the OLD book, the prayer for the Bi&s;hop was, 'that it may plea&s;e thee to ble&s;s this our brother, and &s;end thy grace upon him, that he may duly execute the office whereunto he is called to the edifying thy church;&mdash;In the NEW it is, 'that he may faithfully &s;erve thee in this office to the edifying, and WELL GOVERNING, of thy church.'&mdash;</P>
<P>It is glaringly evident, from the&s;e alterations, that the reviewers of the OLD ordinal were much higher in their notions of Epi&s;copacy than the fir&s;t reform|ers, in who&s;e days it was compiled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. And it is plain likewi&s;e, that they were in <HI>Laud</HI>'s &s;entiments concerning Epi&s;copacy, and intended to make the&s;e the doctrine of the church of England. But they happily failed herein. Whether this was owing to inattention, or to a non-acceptance of the other alterations, they might have made, either by the King, or Parliament, I cannot &s;ay. Certain it is, notwith&s;tanding all the alterations that now ap|pear, and have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the power of ORDAINING, which is pretended to be the mo&s;t ES|SENTIAL one belonging to Bi&s;hops, is &s;till left un|touched, or rather &s;tands confirmed in the PRESENT ordinal; as may be &s;een abundantly proved in the above extract from Mr. <HI>Shaw.</HI></P></NOTE> to which every Clergyman is obliged to give his 'unfeigned a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent.' This therefore cannot be pretended to be only
<PB N="30" REF="011598_0016_0F877A4CBA2E9B88">
the particular opinion of &s;ome private per&s;ons, but mu&s;t be owned to be the e&s;tabli&s;hed doc|trine of the church, to which all her &s;ons are by a mo&s;t &s;acred vow bound to conform.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rubrick,</HI> immediately after the ordina|tion-prayer &s;ays, 'the Bi&s;hop with the PRIESTS pre&s;ent &s;hall lay their hands &s;everally upon the head of every one that receiveth the order of
<PB N="31" REF="011598_0016_0F877A4CBA2E9B88">
prie&s;thood.' As prie&s;ts are not to ordain with|out the Bi&s;hop, &s;o neither is the Bi&s;hop to or|dain without Prie&s;ts. If the former would be e&s;teemed invalid, &s;o, for ought I can &s;ee, mu&s;t the latter too: I am &s;ure, it would be expre&s;sly contrary to the rules of the church, by which &s;ome Prie&s;ts are required to be always pre&s;ent with, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting of the Bi&s;hop in all ordina|tions; as appears by the <HI>Rubrick</HI> abovemention|ed, compared with other parts of the office, and Can. 31, 34.</P>
<P>IT cannot, with any colourable pretence, be &s;aid, that the joining of Pre&s;byters with the Bi|&s;hop in this &s;olemn act does only &s;ignify their witne&s;&s;ing to, or approbating, the thing done. If thus were all, it might as well be done by the laity who were pre&s;ent, or the Deacons; and yet, it is certain, they are not permitted to lay on hands in ordination (as the Prie&s;ts are); though they are permitted to be &s;pectators, wit|ne&s;&s;es, or approvers, as well as they. Be&s;ides, it is evident from the ordination-commi&s;&s;ion, that the office of Prie&s;t is conveyed by the Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byters JOINTLY. 'Receive the HO|LY GHOST for the office and work of a Prie&s;t in the church of GOD, now committed unto thee by the impo&s;ition of OUR hands.' From whence it is as plain as words can make it, that prie&s;tly orders in the church of England are to this very day conferred by the BISHOP AND HIS PRESBYTERS TOGETHER; that the office is re|ceived from their JOINT AUTHORITY; that the Bi&s;hop ought not to ordain without his Pre&s;|byters, any more than without prayer, or impo|&s;ition of hands, which are all made e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary; yea, that he cannot do it without a very material, but ab&s;olutely unwarrantable,
<PB N="32" REF="011598_0017_0F877A4D69CD04F0">
alteration of the words in the commi&s;&s;ion, and perverting the de&s;ign of it, changing the word OUR into MY, and &s;aying, 'by the impo&s;ition of MY hands, in&s;tead of OUR hands; by which variation, how &s;mall &s;oever it may &s;eem, the Bi|&s;hop would lodge the &s;ole power of ordaining in him&s;elf, contrary to the letter and intention of the office, which nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that Pre&s;byters have the &s;ame intrin&s;ic power with the Bi&s;hop: otherwi&s;e it would be no other than a &s;olemn piece of mockery to deliver the commi&s;|&s;ion in the name of the Pre&s;byters EQUALLY with the Bi&s;hop. For how could they convey pow|er to others which they had not in them&s;elves? None certainly &s;hould lay on hands at all in giv|ing mini&s;terial authority, but &s;uch to who&s;e of|fice it belongs to commit the &s;ame doctrine to others, which them&s;elves have received a com|mi&s;&s;ion to be teachers of, no more than any &s;hould con&s;ecrate the elements in the euchari&s;t, who were never impowered to admini&s;ter the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>THERE is not the lea&s;t appearance of any di&s;|tinction by the words in the office, that the granting the commi&s;&s;ion is only from the Bi&s;hop, and that what the Pre&s;byters do in conjunction with him is only con&s;enting to what he does. The church, in the <HI>preface</HI> to the book of or|ders, &s;uppo&s;es impo&s;ition of hands nece&s;&s;ary to the conveying the office of the prie&s;thood. She therein requires PRIESTS, by the <HI>Rubrick,</HI> to lay on hands together with the Bi&s;hop: and, upon the performing of that action, the Bi&s;hop de|clares in expre&s;s words, 'that the office and work of a Prie&s;t is committed unto thee by the impo|&s;ition of OUR hands; which can never be meant, in any proper way of &s;peaking, of the Bi&s;hops
<PB N="33" REF="011598_0017_0F877A4D69CD04F0">
hands alone, but include his Pre&s;byters, who were partners in laying hands with him, as hav|ing a &s;hare al&s;o in conveying the power which was by granted by that action, by a right inhe|rent in their office; though, by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of the country, they are re&s;trained from exerci&s;ing it ALONE, as the BISHOP HIM|SELF ALSO IS. He may indeed ordain a Dea|con without the concurrence of his Pre&s;byters, and in this ca&s;e the impo&s;ition of his own hands alone is required: whence it is plain, that the church makes a manife&s;t di&s;tinction betwixt what the Bi&s;hop can do ALONE, and what he cannot do WITHOUT his Pre&s;byters. She allows him to ordain Deacons by his SOLE power, and there|in the office is conferred ONLY by the impo&s;iti|on of his own hands: but when he is to or|dain Prie&s;ts, he mu&s;t then have the concurrence of his Pre&s;byters with him, and the office is &s;aid to be conferred by the impo&s;ition of OUR hands, that is, of Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byters CONJUNCTLY. That is done by BOTH TOGETHER, which the church allows not to be done by EITHER SEPARATELY.</P>
<P>THIS may be illu&s;trated from the office of 'con&s;ecrating Bi&s;hops,' which is made exactly to corre&s;pond with that of 'ordering Prie&s;ts,' and therefore mu&s;t be allowed to be a parallel ca&s;e. In this office, conformable to the other, (<HI>mutatis mutandis</HI>) the 'Rubrick', ju&s;t after the ordination-prayer, requires the Arch-Bi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent (of whom there mu&s;t be two at lea&s;t) to lay their hands upon the elected Bi|&s;hop, upon which action the Arch-Bi&s;hop im|mediately pronounces the commi&s;&s;ion, (as the Bi&s;hop does in the ordination of Prie&s;ts) but declares, 'the office is committed by the impo|&s;ition of OUR hands;' that is, the epi&s;copal func|tion
<PB N="34" REF="011598_0018_0F877A4E18E67F18">
is conveyed by the impo&s;ition of the hands of the Arch-Bi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops together, with|out whom he ought not to con&s;ecrate a Bi|&s;hop. Now, if a Bi&s;hop can no more ordain a Prie&s;t without the concurrence of his Pre&s;byters, than an Arch-Bi&s;hop can con&s;ecrate a Bi&s;hop without the concurrence of his Bi&s;hops; if Pre&s;|byters are required to u&s;e the '&s;ame action' to|gether with the Bi&s;hop in the ordination of 'Prie&s;ts,' as Bi&s;hops are with the Arch-Bi&s;hop in the con&s;ecration of a 'Bi&s;hop,' <HI>viz.</HI> impo&s;i|tion of hands; and if the commi&s;&s;ion granted to 'Prie&s;ts' by the Bi&s;hop and his Pre&s;byters be in the '&s;ame words' with the commi&s;&s;ion granted to Bi&s;hops by the Arch-Bi&s;hop and his Bi&s;hops, <HI>viz.</HI> 'committed unto thee by the impo&s;ition of OUR hands;' it mu&s;t undeniably follow, that Pre&s;byters have as much an inherent right in their office (in the opinion of the church of England) for ordaining Prie&s;ts, as Bi&s;hops have in their's for con&s;ecrating Bi&s;hops.'</P>
<P>IT cannot be pretended, that the Arch-Bi&s;hop ALONE conveys the power, and that the Bi&s;hops who join with him in laying on of hands do it meerly as witne&s;&s;es to, or approvers of, his act; becau&s;e the Arch-Bi&s;hop's power over Bi&s;hops is granted to be meerly eccle&s;ia&s;tical, I mean owing to human in&s;titution, and not to a divine right.</P>
<P>LET men make what preten&s;ions and eva&s;ions they will, it is certain, from the 'book of orders,' and the practice of the church of England, that &s;he allows Pre&s;byters to ordain in conjunction with their Bi&s;hop, which mu&s;t be under&s;tood, if words and actions have any determined &s;en&s;e, by virtue of a divine right inherent in their office.</P>
<P>IF this be not her &s;en&s;e, what an ab&s;urdity
<PB N="35" REF="011598_0018_0F877A4E18E67F18">
mu&s;t &s;he be guilty of in ordering their concurrence in the &s;ign, who have no manner of intere&s;t or right in the mini&s;terial conveyance of the thing &s;ignified by it? Ju&s;t as if it &s;hould be &s;aid, a Deacon hath power to u&s;e the words of in&s;titu|tion in Bapti&s;m, and to apply the proper ele|ment, but yet hath not power to bapti&s;e; or that a Pre&s;byter may con&s;ecrate the euchari&s;tical elements, according to CHRIST's in&s;titution, and di&s;tribute them to the People, and yet not have power to admini&s;ter the LORD's &s;upper.</P>
<P>IF impo&s;ition of hands in ordination be a meer cypher, and empty formality, in Pre&s;by|ters, will it not be concluded, that &s;o it is in Bi&s;hops too, and that the laying on of the hands of the one and the other is but a needle&s;s ce|remony, and &s;ignifies no more to the convey|ance of mini&s;terial authority, than if the hands of meer laymen were impo&s;ed? But, if this ex|ternal rite be &s;uppo&s;ed to convey the mini&s;terial commi&s;&s;ion from the Bi&s;hop, why does it not import the &s;ame thing from Pre&s;byters, who are enjoined it by the &s;ame authority as the Bi&s;hop, and in conjunction with him? Will not every one naturally conclude, that &s;ince the <HI>action is the &s;ame,</HI> &s;ince it is done at <HI>the &s;ame time,</HI> in the <HI>&s;ame manner,</HI> with the <HI>&s;ame words,</HI> and declared by the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf to be for the <HI>&s;ame end,</HI> that it conveys the <HI>&s;ame powers?</HI>' Thus Mr. <HI>Shaw.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole, if there is no incon&s;i&s;tency between the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>ordinal,</HI> and the <HI>preface</HI> to it, the Bi&s;hops &s;poken of, in the <HI>latter</HI> are not Bi&s;hops in the Doctor's &s;en&s;e, that is, Bi|&s;hops who are <HI>divinely</HI> ve&s;ted with the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> right to convey holy orders. For, according to the appointed rule, no man can be ordained a Prie&s;t without the laying on of the hands of
<PB N="36" REF="011598_0019_0F877A4EEAC858C8">
Pre&s;byters as well as of the Bi&s;hop. The or|daining power is lodged, not in the Bi&s;hop ONLY, or EXCLUSIVELY, but in the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and Pre&s;byters CONJUNCTLY. If Pre&s;byters cannot ordain by them&s;elves ALONE, neither can the Bi&s;hop. There mu&s;t be, according to the book, the concurrence of BOTH. It is from hence evi|dent, that the re&s;traint laid both upon Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, as to the exerci&s;e of their ordain|ing power, is meerly eccle&s;ia&s;tical. The church of England certainly allows an <HI>inherent right</HI> in BOTH to ordain, though &s;he allows neither to exerci&s;e this right but within certain limitations. And though &s;he accounts none LAWFUL Bi|&s;hops or Pre&s;byters but &s;uch as have been LAW|FULLY admitted to office, &s;he is far from NUL|LIFYING the orders given by either. She no|where declares ordination by Pre&s;byters to be invalid, though &s;he e&s;teems it not LAWFUL. And herein &s;he differs from tho&s;e few of her high flying &s;ons, who would make their own uncharitable notions her avowed doctrine.</P>
<P>WHAT has been above offered in proof, that the <HI>jus divinum</HI> of Epi&s;copacy, according to the Doctor's &s;en&s;e of it, is not contained in the 'pre|face to the book of ordination,' will receive fur|ther illu&s;tration, if we con&s;ider what were the &s;entiments of the fir&s;t reformers, tho&s;e of them in &s;pecial who had a hand in compiling the ordinal.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid, from Dr. <HI>Calamy,</HI> (an&s;w. to the appeal, p. 8) 'that in the year 1537, the Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Arch-Deacons, and Clergy of England, in their book intitled, 'the in&s;truc|tion of a chri&s;tian man,' &s;ub&s;cribed with all their hands, and dedicated to the King, expre&s;sly re|&s;olve, that Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops, by GOD's LAW, are ONE and the SAME.' To this the Doctor re|plies
<PB N="37" REF="011598_0019_0F877A4EEAC858C8">
(def. p. 22) '<HI>Collier</HI> has given an ab|&s;tract of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of this book. In this ab&s;tract there is nothing like what the Doctor would prove from it, but &s;omething extremely unlike it.' <HI>Collier</HI>'s &s;ilence is to lit|tle purpo&s;e. Meerly an omi&s;&s;ion of his, which might have been de&s;igned to &s;erve his own ends, ought to be e&s;teemed as nothing, when oppo&s;ed to direct po&s;itive evidence given in the ca&s;e by one of an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation for veracity, e&s;pecially as he has quoted the very words of the book it&s;elf. And as to the pa&s;&s;age in this ab&s;tract, which is '&s;o extremely unlike' to what I had brought to view, it can have this appear|ance to tho&s;e only who are di&s;ordered in their &s;ight. If there is any 'unlikene&s;s,' it mu&s;t be in the following words, which the Doctor has di&s;tingui&s;hed by the manner of printing, 'BI|SHOPS <HI>are authori&s;ed by our Saviour to</HI> CONTINUE THE SUCCESSION, <HI>and</HI> PERPETUATE THE HI|ERARCHY.' But it ought to be remembered, it had been &s;aid before, 'Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts are one and the &s;ame thing': and, if &s;o, its being &s;aid afterwards, 'that Bi&s;hops are authori&s;ed to continue the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,' conveys preci&s;ely the &s;ame idea as if it had been &s;aid, 'Prie&s;ts are authori&s;ed' to do this. This pa&s;&s;age cannot be made at all 'unlike' to the other, unle&s;s the whole Clergy of the church of England in that day are made to contradict them&s;elves; for which no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned but that of &s;erving a pre&s;ent turn.</P>
<P>THE Doctor allows, that the book intitled, 'a nece&s;&s;ary erudition for any chri&s;tian man,' which though 'drawn up by only a committee of the King's nomination,' was yet authori&s;ed by both hou&s;es of Parliament, prefaced by the King
<PB N="38" REF="011598_0020_0F877A4F9E65E7F8">
him&s;elf, and publi&s;hed in 1543 by his com|mand; I &s;ay, the Doctor allows (p. 23) that, in this book, it is declared, 'that the &s;cripture &s;peaks expre&s;sly of no more than the two orders of Prie&s;ts and Deacons;' con&s;equently, Bi&s;hops mu&s;t be, in the apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e reform|ers, of the &s;ame rank and order with Prie&s;ts, their office the &s;ame, and the &s;uperiority of the one above the other by the ordinance of man, and not of GOD. But, &s;ays the Doctor, from <HI>Col|lier</HI> 'the ERUDITION makes <HI>orders</HI> one of the &s;even &s;acraments, and defines it a gift of grace for admini&s;tration in the church; that it is con|veyed by con&s;ecration and impo&s;ition of the Bi|&s;hop's hands; that in the beginning of chri&s;ti|anity, this character was given by the Apo&s;tles.' He then adds, 'how to reconcile the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages may be difficult; and until this be done, they can prove but little on either &s;ide.' There is nothing to reconcile in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages. If, as the&s;e reformers &s;ay, 'the &s;cripture makes men|tion of only the two orders of Prie&s;ts and Dea|cons,' Bi&s;hops cannot, in their opinion, be a di&s;tinct order from Prie&s;ts; con&s;equently, when they further &s;ay, 'the gift for admini&s;tration in the church is conveyed by con&s;ecration and im|po&s;ition of the Bi&s;hop's hand,' by Bi&s;hop they mu&s;t mean an officer of the &s;ame rank or order with Prie&s;ts, unle&s;s they are made fooli&s;hly, as well as needle&s;sly, to contradict them&s;elves, when their words are as capable of a con&s;i&s;tent con|&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT is evident then, beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;|pute, from the 'in&s;titution' and 'erudition;' that, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, 'Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts were one and the &s;ame order' in the opinion of the church of England. But, &s;ays

the Doctor, (p. 25) 'at this &s;tage of the reforma|tion, it is no wonder that we meet with &s;ome crude expre&s;&s;ions relating to Epi&s;copacy.' And again, (p. 24) 'among the doctrines that had not been fully canva&s;&s;ed, by <HI>Cranmer</HI> and his friends, mu&s;t be reckoned that of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government.' But the plain truth is, the &s;entiments of the church of England, relative to Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, were much the &s;ame in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, as they were in the days of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth,; in order to evince which I had re|cour&s;e (an&s;. to app. p. 9) to the '&s;elect a&s;&s;em|bly called by King <HI>Edward</HI> for the re&s;olution of &s;everal que&s;tions relative to the &s;ettlement of religion.' To which the Doctor replies, 'It was at this time [in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth] and not ten years afterwards, in the reign of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the Sixth, as Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> following his blind guide, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dr. would not have di&s;covered too much reverence for a celebrated Bi&s;hop of the church of England, if he had here u&s;ed a &s;ofter epithet.

In a marginal note, (p. 17) he adopts the &s;entiments of a puny writer, in one of the New-York peri|odical papers, concerning this truly great man, by calling the account he gives of his <HI>Irenicum</HI> 'a ju&s;t one.' Says he, 'I do not &s;cruple to declare, that I look upon the <HI>Irenicum</HI> to have been a ha&s;ty, indi|ge&s;ted, partial account of principles and facts.'

It is to little purpo&s;e to &s;ay, 'he wrote it at the age of 24;' or to bring him in &s;aying, 'there were many things in it, which if he was to write again, he would not &s;ay.'

This '&s;trong proof' follows in the&s;e words, 'For in the &s;ame copy of que&s;tions and re&s;olutions, Dr. <HI>Leighton</HI>'s an&s;wer to the eleventh que&s;tion is; 'I &s;uppo&s;e that a Bi&s;hop hath authority of GOD, as his mini&s;ter, by &s;cripture to make a Prie&s;t; but he ought not to admit any man to be a Prie&s;t, and con&s;ecrate him, or to appoint him to any mini&s;try in the church without the Prince's licence and con&s;ent. And that any other man hath authority to make a Prie&s;t by &s;cripture, I have not read, nor any example there|of.' To the twelfth que&s;tion <HI>Leighton</HI> an&s;wers, 'I &s;uppo&s;e that there is a con&s;ecration required, as by impo&s;ition of hands; for &s;o we be taught in the en&s;amples of the Apo&s;tles.' Now <HI>Durell,</HI> in his Vindiciae, &s;ays, 'That, having had an op|portunity of examining the original manu&s;cript, he found that Cranmer <HI>gave his con&s;ent to the&s;e two opinions of</HI> Leighton, &s;ub&s;cribing to each <HI>Th: Cantuarien&s;is.</HI>' It is ob&s;ervable, the '&s;trong proof' that <HI>Cranmer</HI> changed his opinion is re&s;ted upon the evidence of <HI>Durell,</HI> which is really no evidence at all, if Mr. <HI>Boy&s;e</HI> may be believed, who &s;peaks of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of the ancient Epi&s;copacy, p. 21.</NOTE> as 'an author too notorious for his many fal&s;hoods and mi&s;takes in this kind to be depended on.'

For, &s;ays he (p. 27) 'Why <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> left out this pa&s;&s;age is plain; it interfered with the de|&s;ign of his <HI>Irenicum</HI>: but why <HI>Burnet</HI> omitted it is doubtful.' There can be no doubt in the

ca&s;e. If this pa&s;&s;age was not in the original manu&s;cript the rea&s;on of his not in&s;erting it is at once evident. If it was there, he mu&s;t, with|out all controver&s;y be e&s;teemed a di&s;hone&s;t pub|li&s;her of original manu&s;cripts; which would, in this ca&s;e, be very extraordinary, as it would have been to his purpo&s;e to have given us the&s;e words, and he could have no imaginable tempta|tion thus unfairly to &s;uppre&s;s them. But &s;hould it be &s;uppo&s;ed true, that <HI>Cranmer</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed his con&s;ent to the opinion of <HI>Leighton,</HI> as &s;ignified in the above quoted an&s;wers to the tenth and twelfth que&s;tions, it would not argue that he had changed his &s;entiments as to this, that 'Bi|&s;hops and Prie&s;ts were not two things, but one office in the beginning of CHRIST's religion.' The only words upon which &s;uch a change of opinion can be grounded are the&s;e, 'I &s;uppo&s;e that a Bi&s;hop hath authority of GOD, as his mini&s;ter, by &s;cripture to make a Prie&s;t&mdash;and that any other man hath authority to make a Prie&s;t by &s;cripture I have not read.&mdash;But for aught any thing that is here &s;aid, Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts might, in <HI>Leighton</HI>'s opinion, be one and the &s;ame order of officers in the church of CHRISt; and nothing appears in any of his other an&s;wers in contradiction hereto. And as to the words, 'That any other man hath authority to make a Prie&s;t I have not read,' it is evident that 'by any other man is meant, any other man not ve&s;t|ed with clerical authority. The general &s;train of all the an&s;wers to this eleventh que&s;tion plain|ly leads to the thought, that it was intended for the &s;ettlement of this point, whether the power of making Prie&s;ts was appropriated to the Clergy, &s;o as that it might not be exerci&s;ed by meer laymen. It was by no means de&s;igned
<PB N="44" REF="011598_0023_0F877A51D86EF970">
to decide the que&s;tion, Whether ordination was appropriated to Bi&s;hops in oppo&s;ition to, or exclu&s;ion of, Pre&s;byters? This is put beyond di&s;pute by the an&s;wer particularly of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of York to that que&s;tion, which is this, 'That a Bi&s;hop may make a Prie&s;t may be de|duced from &s;cripture&mdash;And that ANY OTHER THAN BISHOPS OR PRIESTS may make a Prie&s;t we neither find in &s;cripture, or out of &s;crip|ture.</P>
<P>THE plain truth is, it does not appear from any one of the an&s;wers, to any of the propo&s;ed que&s;tions, that there was a difference in the &s;en|timents of the&s;e Bi&s;hops and Divines as to the ONENESS, or SAMENESS, of the ORDER of Bi|&s;hops and Pre&s;byters; though they might dif|fer in their opinion about the DEGREE in the &s;ame order. The Arch-Bi&s;hop of York's an&s;wer to the tenth que&s;tion, 'Whether Bi&s;hops or Prie&s;ts were fir&s;t,' will convey to us a clear and ju&s;t idea of this; as we find in it &s;uch words as the&s;e, 'the name of a Bi&s;hop is not a name of ORDER but a name of office, &s;ignifying an over|&s;eer. And although the inferior Shepherds have al&s;o care to over&s;ee their flock, yet forasmuch as the Bi&s;hop's charge is al&s;o to over&s;ee the She|pherds, the name of over&s;eers is given to the Bi&s;hops, and not to the other; and as he is in DEGREE higher, &s;o in their con&s;ecration we find difference even from the primitive church.' I &s;hall yet add; to the 13th que&s;tion, 'Whether (if it fortuned a chri&s;tian Prince learned to con|quer certain dominions of infidels, having none but temporal learned men with him) if it be de|fended by the law, that he and they &s;hould preach and teach the word of GOD there, or no? and al&s;o make and con&s;titute Prie&s;ts, or no?
<PB N="45" REF="011598_0023_0F877A51D86EF970">
I &s;ay to this 13th que&s;tion, <HI>Leighton</HI>'s an&s;wer is, 'I &s;uppo&s;e the affirmative thereof to be true; <HI>quamvis pote&s;tas clavium refidet praecipue in Ec|cle&s;ia.</HI>' And to the fourteenth que&s;tion, Whe|ther it be forefended by the law (if it &s;o fortune that all the Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts of a region were dead, and that the word of GOD &s;hould remain there unpreached, and the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m and others unmini&s;tred) that the King of the re|gion &s;hould make Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts to &s;upply the &s;ame or no?' His an&s;wer is, 'I &s;uppo&s;e the affirmative to be true, in ca&s;e that there cannot Bi&s;hops or PRIESTS be had forth of other coun|tries conveniently.' The&s;e an&s;wers are e&s;&s;ential|ly different from what the Doctor would have given to the&s;e que&s;tions, and ab&s;olutely incom|patible with the divine right of Epi&s;copacy in his &s;en&s;e of it. And yet, the&s;e &s;elected Bi&s;hops and Divines were perfectly unanimous in &s;aying, that, in the ca&s;e propo&s;ed, 'learned laymen not only may, but ought to preach and teach GOD's word;' and the greater part of them declare it to be their opinion, that the 'PRINCE, (in this &s;ame ca&s;e) and his TEMPORAL LEARN|ED MEN may make and in&s;titute mini&s;ters, or Prie&s;ts.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s Hi&s;t. reform. p. 231, 232, 233, 234.

Enough, I tru&s;t, has been already &s;aid to &s;how, that no valid proof has been given, that <HI>Cranmer</HI> &s;ub|&s;cribed <HI>Leighton</HI>'s an&s;wers; or, if he did, that this was &s;ufficient to fa&s;ten on him a change of &s;entiments relative to Epi&s;copacy: nor am I yet per&s;uaded to think, that there are any proofs from which it will appear, that it was ever his '&s;ettled belief that Bi&s;hops are &s;uperior to Pre&s;|byters by apo&s;tolical in&s;titution.' It is a pity the Doctor has not quoted the pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Cran|mer</HI>'s writings, upon which he finds that there was 'no fluctuation in his principles on this head.' He &s;peaks of a '<HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> he compiled, in which, if we may believe Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> he fully owns the divine in&s;titution of Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts.'

right of Epi&s;copacy a&s;&s;erted.</HI>' This &s;ermon is, I conclude, the very one repaired to by Mr. <HI>Dru|ry</HI> in order to prove that <HI>Cranmer</HI> retracted his opinion about Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts; to whom Mr. <HI>Boy&s;e</HI> replies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ancient Epi&s;copacy, p. 8.</NOTE> 'the pa&s;&s;age he has cited in this &s;ermon no way a&s;&s;erts Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops to be at the beginning two di&s;tinct orders.' If the Doctor will bring to view this, or any other pa&s;|&s;age, in this &s;ermon, or in any other writing of <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and from thence point out to us the affirmed change in his &s;entiments, we will rea|dily &s;ubmit; but until then we &s;hall beg leave to think, that he ever adhered to the opinion, 'that Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops were at one time, and not two things, but one office in the be|ginning of CHRIST's religion.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid, (an&s;. to app. p. 12) from Mr. <HI>J. Owen,</HI> and upon his authority, 'that the noti|on of the right of Bi&s;hops to govern and ordain, as being officers in the church &s;uperior to Pre&s;by|ters, by divine appointment, was fir&s;t promoted in the church of England by Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</HI>' The Doctor takes occa&s;ion from hence to play with the word PROMOTED to make his readers merry.

It is a 'my&s;terious' word; it contains in it '&s;ome &s;ecret meaning, which he does not com|prehend;' it 'mu&s;t be unfolded,' or, notwith|&s;tanding what may be the meaning of this un|&s;earchable word, 'he mu&s;t take the liberty to believe, that the national e&s;tabli&s;hment of this doctrine again and again, and making it a fun|damental principle of our reformation, was do|ing &s;omething to PROMOTE it.' I a&s;&s;ure the Doctor I would not have u&s;ed this word, which
<PB N="48" REF="011598_0025_0F877A562178B1F0">
appeared to me a harmle&s;s, well meaning one, could I have fore&s;een the &s;trange influence it would have on him. It has certainly very much ob&s;tructed his di&s;cerning faculty: otherwi&s;e, it would not have appeared to him, that the &s;upe|riority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters, by divine ap|pointment, was a doctrine that had been 'again and again nationally e&s;tabli&s;hed;' much le&s;s that this was a 'fundamental principle of the re|formation.' Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> without all doubt, was the FIRST, I will not &s;ay that PRO|MOTED this doctrine, le&s;t a word of &s;o profound a meaning &s;hould puzzle the Doctor; but he was the FIRST, in oppo&s;ition to any 'national e&s;tabli&s;hment,' or its being at all a principle, much le&s;s 'a fundamental one of the reforma|tion,' that openly a&s;&s;erted, and pleaded for this doctrine. Perhaps the Doctor, now I have &s;ub|&s;tituted a plain word, in&s;tead of a 'my&s;terious' one, will be convinced of this by what has been offered to his view: if he is not, I am &s;atisfied, the impartial Public will.</P>
<P>HE goes on, 'if the meaning' of this incom|prehen&s;ible word <HI>promoted</HI> 'be, that none before Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI> contended for the &s;uperiori|ty of Bi&s;hops over Pre&s;byters, by divine appoint|ment, in their writings, I mu&s;t &s;till deny it; as I am able to produce abundant evidence to the contrary.' The reader will remember, I brought in Arch Bi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> as the fir&s;t promoter of Epi&s;copacy upon the plan of a divine right, from Mr. <HI>J. Owen,</HI> depending on his authority. Of what great importance is it, whether he was the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, or fourth that contended for this doctrine? And yet, the Doctor has taken up eight or nine pages in endeavouring to prove, that a few others wree before <HI>Laud</HI> in pleading
<PB N="49" REF="011598_0025_0F877A562178B1F0">
the divine right of Epi&s;copacy. But the unhap|pine&s;s is, he is gro&s;sly mi&s;taken in the idea he has given of the &s;entiments of the men he has named. They were, it is true, Epi&s;copalians upon the foot of divine right, in a qualified, mi|tigated &s;en&s;e; but not in the &s;en&s;e in which <HI>Laud</HI> and the Doctor, plead for this right. It was not the opinion of any one of them, that the right of Bi&s;hops, by divine appointment, to govern and ordain, was &s;uch, as that it could not, as the ca&s;e might require, be altered: and they were clear and full in &s;ignifying their &s;en|timents to this purpo&s;e. I have by me a book, intitled, 'A repre&s;entation of the government of the church of England, according to the judg|ment of her Bi&s;hops unto the end of Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI>'s reign,' by <HI>Stephen Lob,</HI> as I find his name in&s;erted, in the title page, by Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI>; in which are extracts, from all the writers Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> has mentioned, and many more, making it evident, beyond denial, that their notion of Epi&s;copacy, upon the <HI>jure divine|&s;hip</HI> plan, was &s;o qualified as to be con&s;i&s;tent with an intire change in the exerci&s;e of governing and ordaining power: but it mu&s;t &s;uffice, that I may not take up too much room, to bring to view a few of the&s;e extracts, from only two or three of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the&s;e writers; and I have &s;elected the&s;e principally for in&s;truction to the Doctor, and to let him and the Public know, that he is HIGHER in his church-principles than the HIGHEST it was in his power to name, when HIGH notions of Epi&s;copacy fir&s;t began to be broached.</P>

<P>UNTIL the Doctor &s;ees fit to profe&s;s his rea|dine&s;s to fall in with the&s;e &s;entiments, I &s;hall think my&s;elf at liberty to believe, that <HI>Laud</HI> was the FIRST who promoted Epi&s;copacy, conforma|bly to the idea, he, and the very &s;mall party he is joined with, entertains concerning it.</P>
<P>AS, upon the point of <HI>Re-ordination,</HI> he 'does not undertake to contradict me, (to u&s;e his own words, p. 42) but to place it in a proper point of light,' I &s;hall only de&s;ire the reader to take notice of one thing he has omitted, which is of far greater importance than any thing he has offered. It is the act of the thirteenth of <HI>Eli|&s;abeth,</HI> which runs thus,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lob</HI>'s repre&s;ent. of the government of the church of England, p. 59, 60.</NOTE> That every per&s;on un|der the degree of a Bi&s;hop, which doth or &s;hall pretend to be a Prie&s;t or mini&s;ter of GOD's holy word and &s;acraments, by rea&s;on of ANY O|THER FORM of in&s;titution, con&s;ecration, or or|dering, than the FORM NOW USED in the reign of our mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign Lady&mdash;&s;hall&mdash; declare his a&s;&s;ent, and &s;ub&s;cribe to all the arti|cles

In con&s;e|quence of this act, <HI>Whittingham</HI> and <HI>Travers,</HI> tho' not ordained according to the FORM THEN IN USE, might notwith&s;tanding be LAWFUL mi|ni&s;ters of the church of England. I mention this to let the Doctor know, that he was mi&s;ta|ken in his declaration, (p. 45) 'that through|out the whole reign (that is of Queen <HI>Eli&s;a|beth</HI>) we are con&s;idering,&mdash;it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed law&mdash;that no man &s;hould be accounted or taken to be a lawful Bi&s;hop, Prie&s;t, or Deacon, in the church of England, or &s;uffered to exe|cute any of the &s;aid functions, WITHOUT EPIS|COPAL ORDINATION.' This is &s;aid in direct contradiction to the abovementioned act of the thirteenth of <HI>Eli&s;abeth,</HI> which continued in force till <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd; when, by another act, 'eve|ry one, not in holy orders by EPISCOPAL OR|DINATION,' was di&s;abled from 'holding any par&s;onage whatever, as if he had been natu|rally dead.' <HI>Whitingham</HI> and <HI>Travers</HI> were there|fore LAWFUL mini&s;ters in the church of England, tho' not EPISCOPALLY ordained; and their holding benefices was not 'by permi&s;&s;ion thro' the nece&s;&s;ity of the times,' but in perfect agree|ment with the then e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the nation.</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it improper to add here, more e&s;pecially for the u&s;e of the Doctor, and his friends, that this act of the thirteenth of <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> is a full proof, that it was not her opinion that ordi|nation

was, by divine appointment, appropriated to Bi&s;hops in di&s;tinction from Pre&s;byters, &s;o as that or|dination by Pre&s;byters only was invalid. Had this been her &s;entiment, &s;he could not in con&s;i&s;tency herewith have given her fiat to this act. Now, let it be particularly remembered, the Doctor has told us, (p. 41) he has 'proved, that the doctrines of the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, in the reign of Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth,</HI> mu&s;t have been agreable to the Queen, and to the principal per&s;ons about her court.' If &s;o, <HI>Whitgift, Bancroft, Bil&s;on,</HI> and other epi&s;|copal writers in this reign, were not for ordi|nation by Bi&s;hops, &s;o as to nullify ordination by Pre&s;byters; nor could they di&s;own any as LAWFUL mini&s;ters of the church of England MEERLY becau&s;e they had been ordained by Pre&s;byters only. The divine right of Epi&s;copa|cy, in the Doctor's &s;en&s;e, could not therefore be the doctrine of the church of England in the reign of Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> (as I have before prov|ed it was not in the reigns either of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, or <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth); and to &s;ay that it could, would be to &s;ay, that two contradic|tory e&s;tabli&s;hments were in force at one and the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now proceeds to &s;how, that there is 'authority in the church of England purely eccle&s;ia&s;tical;'&mdash;But, as in reply (p. 211) to my third objection to the plan of an American Epi&s;copate, he only &s;ays 'it has been an&s;wered already, [he mu&s;t mean in this part of his de|fence, or it is no where endeavoured to be an|&s;wered] I &s;hall po&s;tpone what might have been offered here, until I come to ju&s;tify the force of this objection. Only, I &s;hall think it proper to in&s;ert, in this place, a few pertinent words from <HI>Burn,</HI> who is an author the Doctor will

not &s;u&s;pect to have been wanting in his regard to the church of England. Says he, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, vol. 2. under the word &s;uprema|cy.</NOTE> 'The truth is, that, after the abolition of the papal pow|er, there was no branch of &s;overeignty with which the Princes of this realm, for above a century after the reformation, were more delighted than that of being the &s;upream head of the church: imagining (as it &s;eemeth) that all the power which the Pope claimed and exerci|&s;ed (&s;o far as he was able) was, by the &s;tatutes abrogating the papal authority, annexed to the imperial crown of this realm.&mdash;The Pope arro|gated to him&s;elf a juri&s;diction &s;uperior, not only to his own canon law, but to the municipal laws of kingdoms. And the&s;e Princes of this realm abovementioned &s;eem to have con&s;idered them|&s;elves as POPES IN THEIR OWN DOMINIONS.'&mdash;</P>
<P>THE Doctor, after he had wrote fifty-eight pages, very pertinently introduces his reader, a&s;king, 'What is all this to the purpo&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate?' And then as pertinent|ly an&s;wers the que&s;tion by &s;aying, 'I know not.' Why then did he commit &s;o gro&s;s a tre&s;|pa&s;s upon the patience of the Public? It is true, he &s;aid nothing, in his appeal, 'about the opi|nion of the reformers upon the points of Epi&s;|copacy, and the King's &s;upremacy;' but it is as true, that he &s;aid that which contradicted their opinion, and made it nece&s;&s;ary in an&s;wering his appeal, to &s;et this matter in a ju&s;t light. He has therefore really, though unde&s;ignedly, &s;neer|ed at him&s;elf. If his <HI>&s;ketch of arguments</HI> 'was to <HI>the purpo&s;e</HI> of an American Epi&s;copate,' it was to <HI>the purpo&s;e</HI> to make an&s;wer to it; if it was not
<PB N="58" REF="011598_0030_0F877A5A1987CFF8">
to this purpo&s;e, as is certainly the truth, he knows as well as I, that HE ONLY is the object of ridi|cule for giving occa&s;ion to that which was im|pertinent, as not being to the purpo&s;e of the main point to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>HE now comes to defend his darling doctrine of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the line of Bi|&s;hops. And here he has &s;unk much below my expectations; not having offered any one thing that will bear being examined, though in a cur|&s;ory way only.</P>
<P>I HAD allowed, 'that none have authority in the chri&s;tian church but tho&s;e who derive it from CHRIST, either <HI>mediately,</HI> or <HI>immediate|ly</HI>;' &s;ugge&s;ting, that this was 'the opinion of the Coloni&s;ts of whatever denomination:' up|on which the Doctor, taking it for granted that authority, if conveyed <HI>mediately,</HI> mu&s;t be con|veyed by <HI>per&s;onal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> labours hard to prove a &s;elf-evident truth, namely, 'that where a thing is to be conveyed from one per&s;on to another, not immediately, but by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive communi|cation through a number of intermediate hands, if any one in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion fails of making the conveyance, the thing evidently &s;tops, and pa&s;&s;es not on to the per&s;on to whom it is intended'. Who ever di&s;puted this, which is &s;o evident, up|on the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re propo&s;al, that it cannot be made more to by any method of rea&s;oning whatever? It is a pity the Doctor did not think it proper to prove the <HI>only thing</HI> that here needed proof, <HI>viz.</HI> that authority can be conveyed <HI>mediately</HI> from CHRIST, in no way but by per&s;onal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il he is able to prove this, it is to no pur|po&s;e to &s;ay, 'if the authority fir&s;t given to A is to pa&s;s on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to B, to C, to D, and to E; &s;hould the conveyance &s;top, or be interrupt|ed

at C, &s;o that it pa&s;&s;es not on to D; in that ca&s;e D does not receive it, and therefore cannot convey it to E, unle&s;s D is able to give what it has not.' This pompous &s;hew of demon&s;tra|tion may delude weak minds, but is altoge|ther a rope of &s;and, unle&s;s it be fir&s;t proved, that the authority is &s;o given, that it can in no <HI>medi|ate</HI> way be conveyed, but in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from A to B, and &s;o on. We join with the Doctor in &s;ay|ing 'That no number of men on earth, nor all the Angels in Heaven, can give authority from CHRIST not given to them, or renew this au|thority if lo&s;t.' And what then? Is it not ob|vious to the mo&s;t vulgar under&s;tanding, that the grand point in di&s;pute is here begged, and &s;up|po&s;ed to be granted, namely, that authority is given by CHRIST to be communicated by per|&s;onal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that there is no other <HI>me|diate</HI> way in which it can be communicated? The Doctor might have known, as he pretends an acquaintance with <HI>Hooker</HI>'s 'immortal work,' that the church, at lea&s;t in his opinion, is the <HI>true original &s;ubject</HI> of all power from CHRIST; and that &s;he may <HI>take it away</HI> even from Bi|&s;hops, if they are <HI>proud, tyrannical, and unre|formable in their dealings,</HI> as GOD knows has too often been the ca&s;e. He accordingly declares, <HI>we are not &s;imply, and without exception to urge a lineal de&s;cent of power from the Apo&s;tles by con|tinued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops in every effectual ordi|nation.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

The <HI>colony-churches</HI> are &s;o far 'from certainly believing' what the Doctor would here make them believe, that they care nothing about an uninterrupted line, either of Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;byters; as they know they have power from CHRIST to con|&s;titute officers for all the purpo&s;es of the go&s;pel-mini&s;try, &s;hould it &s;o happen, that the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in regard of Pre&s;byters, as well as Bi|&s;hops, had been interrupted and broken.</P>
<P>THE Doctor goes on, 'as to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the line of Bi&s;hops, I am &s;till of opinion, that it is incumbent on the objectors to prove, that it has been interrupted'.

It has never yet been done, and I challenge the Doctor to do it: nor indeed was it ever the 'univer&s;al practice,' in any age, even to this day, to 'acknowledge none for Bi&s;hops, but tho&s;e who were ordained by Bi&s;hops,' upon the plan of a DIVINE RIGHT. He goes on, 'the con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops was a public act&mdash;e&s;teemed to be a matter of &s;uch importance that the report of it was immediately carried even to di&s;tant places&mdash;and, in di&s;puted ca&s;es, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover, whether the per&s;on was, in re|ality, a Bi&s;hop or not; or, &s;uppo&s;ing the con|trary, that no one would receive epi&s;copal con|&s;ecration from &s;uch hands.' I &s;hall leave it with common &s;en&s;e to judge, whether this is any other than a &s;andy bottom to build one's faith upon, in a matter of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential concern as the un|interruption of this line is made to be. And what the Doctor yet adds is as weak an one. Says he, 'We know from &s;cripture, that IF &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is as nece&s;&s;ary, as, upon a &s;pe|culative examination, it appears to be, CHRIST has promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve and continue it to the end of the world.' That is, in plain engli&s;h, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, allowed, and taken for granted,
<PB N="64" REF="011598_0033_0F877A5C5C2BD290">
that CHRIST has made an uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary, he will take care, in virtue of his promi&s;e, to pre&s;erve and continue it. A nota|ble di&s;covery this! Who, be&s;ides the Doctor, that regards his character, would declare in the face of the world, that he was 'abundantly &s;atis|fied with the&s;e various kinds of evidence,' in an affair e&s;&s;entially connected, in his view, with ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation, which, when examined, appear to be meer nothing?</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid, that, to make the very being of a church, and all covenant hopes of &s;alvation, to re&s;t upon &s;o precarious a foundation as an unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the line of Bi&s;hops, was to expo&s;e the religion of CHRIST to ridi|cule;&mdash;That it would follow upon this doc|trine, that the public wor&s;hip of the non-epi&s;co|palian Coloni&s;ts, of all the di&s;&s;enters in England, and of all the reformed churches who had no mi|ni&s;ters but &s;uch as were ordained by Pre&s;byters, would be an affront to CHRIST; and that, at the reformation, if the popi&s;h Bi&s;hops had &s;tuck to their old principles, and di&s;continued the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion by refu&s;ing to ordain any but tho&s;e of their own communion, it would have been the duty of the laity to have lived without go&s;pel ordinances till a new commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent from Heaven to give authority to admini&s;ter them;&mdash; And I am greatly confirmed in the propriety and force of the&s;e objections by what the Doc|tor has &s;aid in an&s;wer to them. Let the reader compare what we have both offered, and judge for him&s;elf. And, perhaps, he will not judge differently from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claude,</HI> in the like ca&s;e; who&s;e words are the&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; of the reform. part 4, p. 97.</NOTE> 'To &s;peak

<P>IT was further ob&s;erved, in an&s;wer to the ap|peal, 'That the wor&s;t of this doctrine of an unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is, its being derived through the church of Rome;' concerning which it is declared by the church of England in her ho|milies, 'that as at pre&s;ent it is, and hath been for nine hundred years, it is <HI>&s;o far</HI> from being of the nature of the TRUE CHURCH, that NO|THING CAN BE MORE;' be&s;ides which, &s;he ex|plicitly &s;peaks of this church as a FOUL, FIL|THY, OLD, WITHERED HARLOT, the FOULEST and FILTHIEST that was EVER SEEN.' What now is the Doctor's reply? He gives it in a pa&s;|&s;age he quotes from Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s defence, the whole force of which, &s;o far as there is any, lies in the&s;e words, 'Harlot as &s;he is, &s;he may bring forth children, as well as an hone&s;t and virtuous matron, and &s;ometimes children far better than their parent.

<P>THE Doctor &s;ays nothing further, in this &s;ec|tion, in his own defence, that calls for enlarge|ment by way of reply.</P>
<P>THOUGH he had needle&s;sly introduced an ex|tract, in his appeal, from <HI>Chilling&s;worth</HI>'s de|mon&s;tration of Epi&s;copacy, I thought it proper to take &s;ome notice of it.

<P>HE does not deny, that Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> when he wrote his vindication of the church of Scot|land, 'believed Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters to be &s;e|veral degrees of the &s;ame office.' But he adds, 'his &s;ub&s;equent writings afford innumerable proofs, that he afterwards believed the doctrine of Epi&s;copacy, both by the evidence of &s;crip|ture, and the practice of the primitive church.' When he wrote his vindication, he believed the doctrine of Epi&s;copacy in the &s;en&s;e that nineteen in twenty of the members of the church of England believed it then, and believe it now; but that
<PB N="68" REF="011598_0035_0F877A5EEAC01B68">
he ever believed it in the Doctor's &s;en&s;e, or that he ever wrote any thing from whence this can be made evident, I &s;hall not be per&s;uaded to think, until I have better proof of it than bare affirmation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;trange the Doctor has given us no proof from any of the 'writings' of Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> as they 'afford innumerable proofs,' that he believed the doctrine of Epi&s;copacy, in the impleaded &s;en&s;e. It may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, it was not in his power to do this; and the rather, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hop de|clared the &s;entiments mentioned in the an&s;wer to the appeal, when Epi&s;copacy was in its zenith, and it might be expected, on that account, that he would have &s;poken as highly of it, as his con&s;cience would permit. And yet, he is particularly expre&s;s in mak|ing Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, not <HI>di&s;tinct orders,</HI> but <HI>dif|ferent degrees</HI> only in the &s;ame office. His words are the&s;e, which I choo&s;e to quote, that the reader may &s;ee in how full and &s;trong a manner he delivers his &s;entiments upon this head.

The fir&s;t branch of their pow|er is their authority to publi&s;h the go&s;pel, to manage the wor&s;hip, and di&s;pen&s;e the &s;acraments; and this is ALL that is of DIVINE RIGHT in the mini|&s;try, in which Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters are equally &s;harers: But be&s;ides this, the church claim|eth a power of juri&s;diction, of making rules for di&s;ci|pline, and executing the &s;ame; all which indeed is &s;utable to the common laws of &s;ocieties, and the ge|neral rules of &s;cripture, but hath no po&s;itive warrant from any &s;cripture precept.&mdash; I herefore, as to the management of this juri&s;diction, it is in the church's power to ca&s;t it into what mould &s;he will.'&mdash;</NOTE>: nor I &s;hall believe, that <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> ever departed &s;o far from the &s;entiments of his

<HI>Irenicum,</HI> as to fall in with the Doctor in his no|tion of the <HI>jure divinino-&s;hip</HI> of Bi&s;hops in di&s;tinc|tion from Pre&s;byters, before I &s;ee it otherwi&s;e evidenced than by his naked a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>I SHALL take this opportunity to a&s;&s;ure the Doctor, that I am not a&s;hamed openly to de|clare, that I pay 'more deference to <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Rector of Sutton, than to <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> Dean of St. Paul's, or Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, in the di&s;pute relative to Epi&s;copacy.' He may call this 'par|tiality, ab&s;urd, and prepo&s;terous:' But it may be, the Public will think with me, that a <HI>rec|tor&s;hip,</HI> or <HI>bi&s;hopric</HI> might have &s;ome influence to enlarge his notions of the power and dignity of Bi&s;hops, though never that I know of, to the height the Doctor would carry them.</P>
<P>AS to Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her,</HI> that known and ce|lebrated antiquary, it is as evident as a fact of this nature can be, that it was his &s;ettled opini|on, 'That Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters differ only in degree, not in order. What the Doctor has &s;aid tends only to di&s;gui&s;e, not to invalidate this truth. I never &s;aid, or thought, that the Arch-Bi&s;hop e&s;teemed <HI>ordination</HI> by Pre&s;byters <HI>regular,</HI> where there were Bi&s;hops by whom it might be obtained. But it is indi&s;putable, even from the very words omitted by me, in the Arch-Bi|&s;hop's letter to <HI>Bernard,</HI> but cited by the Doc|tor, that he accounted <HI>ordination by Pre&s;byters to be valid in places where Bi&s;hops&punc; cannot be had</HI>; which is e&s;&s;entially incon&s;i&s;tent with the Doctor's &s;cheme. The plain truth is, the Arch-Bi&s;hop neither thought Bi&s;hops were a di&s;tinct order from Pre&s;byters, or that ordination was, by di|vine appointment, appropriated to that order. This is, beyond all rea&s;onable di&s;pute, evident from his own words, profe&s;&s;edly u&s;ed in arguing

<HEAD>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Second Section.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctor has &s;een fit, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, to pa&s;s over almo&s;t eve|ry thing, this &s;ection relates to, that was mate|rial; choo&s;ing to detain his readers, from the main point, by calling their attention to that which is of comparatively &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>HE thought it proper, in his appeal, to make a di&s;tinction 'between the &s;everal things that had been added to the epi&s;copal office, and tho&s;e which originally and e&s;&s;entially belong to it.' It was &s;aid in reply, 'The que&s;tion is not, whe|ther the&s;e and &s;uch like appendages to the epi&s;|copal office will be de&s;tructive of the powers which e&s;&s;entially belong to it; but whether they do not unfit the per&s;ons ve&s;ted with it for the proper di&s;charge of the duties of it? in&s;omuch that it would be unrea&s;onable to add &s;uch ap|pendages, and as much &s;o to expect, if they are added, that chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors &s;hould not com|plain of it as an intolerable grievance.' The Doctor affects, to be at a lo&s;s to know, who I meant by 'chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors,' by his crying out 'Profe&s;&s;ors of what!' I will tell him, pro|fe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="72" REF="011598_0037_0F877A6269003358">
of faith in CHRIST, as the one only SU|PREME HEAD of the church, in oppo&s;ition to all other claims, whether they are made by the POPE, or any chri&s;tian PRINCES or STATES whatever. He then &s;ays, 'Whether the addi|tion of &s;uch append<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ges be rea&s;onable, or un|rea&s;onable, is nothing to me; and, which is much more, it is nothing to the ca&s;e of &s;uch an Epi&s;|copate as is propo&s;ed for America.' Why then, in the name of wonder, did he &s;ay any thing about the&s;e appendages? If it was nothing to him, that is, the cau&s;e he was defending, and nothing to the ca&s;e of an American Epi&s;copate, it was mo&s;t certainly to no purpo&s;e for him to &s;ay a word about them.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecuting the di&s;tinct on he had made, he ob&s;erved. 'He who has a &s;mall dioce&s;s has the &s;ame epi&s;copal powers, as he that has a large one; and it matter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not as to the validity of the act, whether it be performed by the one or the other.' To which it was an&s;wered, as he has &s;ummed up the an&s;wer, 'It certainly does as to his capacity to &s;erve the ends of his office; and there is, in proportion, the &s;ame incongruity in placing Bi&s;hops at the head of large dioce&s;&s;es, as in having an univer&s;al one.' What now &s;ays the Doctor to this? His reply is, 'This con&s;i|dered as an an&s;wer to me, and in no other light are we authori&s;ed to con&s;ider it, amounts to no more than this; that although what I &s;aid is al|lowed to be true, yet &s;omething that I did not &s;ay is entirely fal&s;e. The thing which I did not &s;ay is, that a Bi&s;hop is as able to &s;erve the great ends of his office in a large dioce&s;s as in a &s;mall one.' It is true, he did not &s;ay this; but it is as true, that it was with propriety, and irre&s;i&s;table
<PB N="73" REF="011598_0037_0F877A6269003358">
force that I &s;aid it. He knows, or is gro&s;sly ignorant, that we never di&s;owned the validity of epi&s;copal acts, where Bi&s;hops had large dioce&s;&s;es. He knows al&s;o, unle&s;s he is an utter &s;tranger to the non-epi&s;copalian &s;entiments, that we judge it highly improper, and an intolerable grievance, that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be at the head of large dio|ce&s;&s;es; becau&s;e it de&s;troys their capacity to &s;erve the ends, de&s;igned by CHRIST in the in|&s;titution of their office. His only bu&s;ine&s;s therefore was to &s;how, that this appendage did not affect the Bi&s;hop's capacity to an&s;wer the ends of his appointment. As the 'validity' of epi&s;copal acts was never called in que&s;tion, on account of the largene&s;s, or &s;mallne&s;s, of their dioce&s;&s;es, his mentioning this appendage was quite impertinent, unle&s;s with a view to prove, in oppo&s;ition to us, that it would con&s;i&s;t with the Bi&s;hops duty; which, it &s;hould &s;eem, he does think was any part of what he was called to. However, he goes on, 'If I had &s;aid this [that a Bi&s;hop is as able to &s;erve the ends of his office in a large dioce&s;s, as a &s;mall one,] unle&s;s the large dioce&s;s is &s;uppo&s;ed to be larger than in any prote&s;tant country&mdash;it would not have been &s;o very exceptionable."&mdash;Much might be &s;aid here, but I &s;hall make no other an&s;wer than this, that when the Doctor under&s;tands the full meaning of tho&s;e words of our Saviour, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' and has his mind impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the duty incumbent on a Bi|&s;hop in the church of CHRIST, I have no doubt but he will alter his &s;entiments upon this head.</P>
<P>HE now pa&s;&s;es on to the trite worn-out in|&s;tances of <HI>Aerius</HI> and <HI>Colluthus,</HI> but without &s;ay|ing any thing worthy of detaining us very long.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Aerius</HI>; I had &s;aid, 'That <HI>Epiphanius</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="011598_0038_0F877A631805F6A0">
was the fir&s;t that found fault with him, for his opinion of the parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.' Upon this the Doctor, that he might make &s;ome &s;hew of learning, egregiou&s;sly trifles. The on|ly thing that needs a remark is, his ob&s;erving, 'If an intimation is intended, that <HI>Ephiphanius</HI> was the only per&s;on that, <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> con&s;idered the doctrine of <HI>Aerius</HI> as exceptionable, or that the parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters was generally admitted in the fourth century, the &s;ugge&s;tion is groundle&s;s. The united voice of antiquity, and even the conce&s;&s;ions of our mo&s;t con&s;iderable ad|ver&s;aries, prove the contrary with invincible evidence.' This is not the fir&s;t or &s;econd time, that the Doctor has di&s;covered his little acquaintance with antiquity; though he &s;peaks with po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, as though he was the mo&s;t learned antiquary. Epi&s;copal writers of the fir&s;t figure, &s;uch as <HI>Reignolds, Jewel, Bridges,</HI> Bi&s;hop of Oxford, <HI>Whitaker,</HI> Regius Profe&s;&s;or of divinity in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge, Stil|lingfleet,</HI> and others, would have informed him, had he not read the original authors, that <HI>Je|rom, Au&s;tin, Ambro&s;e, Sedulius, Prima&s;ius, Chry|&s;i&s;tom, The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phy act,</HI> were, as to the identity of order upon the footing of divine right, of the &s;ame opinion with <HI>Aerius,</HI> though they lived much about the &s;ame time; and, I may add, &s;o were <HI>Clement</HI> of Rome, <HI>Polycarp, Ju&s;tin,</HI> and <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> who lived before him. It is not there|fore in the lea&s;t probable, that <HI>Aerius</HI> was con|demned CHIEFLY, as the Doctor or &s;ays, for his opinion concerning the parity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. Had this been the ca&s;e, mo&s;t of his co-temporaries mu&s;t have been condemned likewi&s;e, as they were chargeable with the &s;ame mon&s;trous here&s;y. It is far more rea&s;onable to
<PB N="75" REF="011598_0038_0F877A631805F6A0">
think, that he acted in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>then</HI> general practice, exciting, in con&s;equence of his opinion, divi&s;ions and di&s;cord; and that this, among other things, was the true rea&s;on of his condemnation. And this indeed appears to be the purport of the account, the Doctor him&s;elf has given us from <HI>Mo&s;heim,</HI> the only evidence he has brought to prove, that <HI>Aerius</HI> was con|demned, not 'meerly or only,' as I had &s;aid, but CHIEFLY for his opinion concerning the identity of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Collythus</HI>; he has added an 'extract from the &s;ynodical epi&s;tle of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Egypt, Thebais, Lybia,</HI> and <HI>Pontapolis,</HI> and from a joint letter of the Clergy of the Province of <HI>Marco|tis,</HI> both pre&s;erved in the works of <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI>' But if he had &s;een fit, as he was de&s;ired, to con|&s;ult <HI>Blondel</HI>'s Apologia, or what is &s;aid from it in the Irenicum, he would have found a full an&s;wer to the&s;e extracts. I &s;hall here lay before his view what is &s;aid in the Irenicum as a &s;um|mary of <HI>Blondel</HI>'s repre&s;entation. It is in the&s;e words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. p. 381, 382.</NOTE> 'Fir&s;t, the pronouncing &s;uch an ordina|tion null doth not evidence, that they looked on or|dination as belonging, of divine right, only to Bi|&s;hops; for we find, by many in&s;tances, that act|ing in a bare contempt of eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons was &s;ufficient to degrade any from being Pre&s;|byters.

<P>I NOW come, my readers, to hold out to your view, not a 'CURIOSITY,' but a marvellous phenomenon in the 'regions of controver&s;y.' The Doctor had &s;aid, in his appeal, 'No in|&s;tance of an ordination by meer Pre&s;byters can be found in the church for &s;everal ages.' It was offered in reply, 'We &s;hould take it kindly to have pointed out to us &s;o much as ONE in|&s;tance, within the long period of an hundred and fifty years from CHRIST, of an ordination by any Bi&s;hop, in any part of the chri&s;tian world; meaning by a Bi&s;hop, an officer in the church &s;uperior to a Pre&s;byter. I have lately been looking over the extracts I made twenty years ago from the FATHERS OF THE TWO FIRST CENTURIES, and do not find a SINGLE EXAM|PLE of an ordination by Bi&s;hops, in the appro|priated &s;en&s;e, within the time before &s;pecified. If the Doctor would pre&s;ent us with one [that is from the FATHERS within this time] it would be to me a great favour.' What now is the Doctor's an&s;wer? It follows in the&s;e words, 'Behold, reader, a curio&s;ity. This very &s;ame challenge he made in his <HI>Dudlean</HI> lecture, (p. 70) to which a formal and direct an&s;wer has been given by Mr. <HI>Leaming.</HI> His words are as follow: I will comply with his (Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s) demand; and I hope he will allow the autho|rity of my author. I might produce many, but for brevity's &s;ake &s;hall mention but one in|&s;tance; and that is the ordination of <HI>Titus</HI> by
<PB N="77" REF="011598_0039_0F877A63E570CB08">
St. <HI>Paul.</HI> That <HI>Titus</HI> had an epi&s;copal ordina|tion appears from the charge St. <HI>Paul</HI> gave him, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. 'For this cau&s;e left I thee in Crete, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;et in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I HAD APPOINTED THEE' St. <HI>Paul</HI> charged him to 'rebuke with all authority;' and again, 'a man that is an heretic, after the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond admonition, reject.' Here St. <HI>Paul</HI> com|mitts to <HI>Titus</HI> the whole power of ordaining el|ders in Crete, and of governing them, and all the chri&s;tians in that I&s;land. This authority is clearly expre&s;&s;ed, and the bounds, in which he was to exerci&s;e it, di&s;tinctly marked out. Thus it appears, that this was an <HI>epi&s;copal ordination</HI> in our &s;en&s;e of the matter. Our Bi&s;hops claim nothing but the very &s;ame power that St. <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Titus</HI> over the I&s;land of Crete.' Hav|ing cited this pa&s;&s;age from Mr. <HI>Leaming,</HI> he goes on, 'Is not this a fair and full an&s;wer to the Doctor's demand? Ought he then to be un&s;a|tisfied, when all that he a&s;ks has been given him?' Unle&s;s the Doctor [<HI>Chandler</HI>] will allow me to &s;uppo&s;e, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es under&s;tanding but in a very low degree, which I would not chu&s;e to do, I mu&s;t hold my&s;elf obliged to think, that he KNEW that this was neither a <HI>fair</HI> or <HI>full</HI> an|&s;wer; and that I had no rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with it, as NOTHING that I a&s;ked, in&s;tead of EVERY THING, had been given me. Was it po&s;&s;ible one of common di&s;cernment &s;hould not perceive the gro&s;s impertinence of Mr. <HI>Leam|ing</HI> in bringing to view a pretended SCRIPTURE in&s;tance of epi&s;copal ordination, when the in|&s;tance I de&s;ired, in as plain language as I could &s;peak, was one from the FATHERS of the chri&s;|tian church. Would the Doctor have thought
<PB N="78" REF="011598_0040_0F877A656616BF68">
I had given a <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>full</HI> an&s;wer to that affirma|tion of his, 'There is not an in&s;tance of ordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion by Pre&s;byters to be found in the chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;everal ages,' if I had only &s;aid, 'I might produce many, but for brevity's &s;ake &s;hall men|tion but one in&s;tance,' and that is the ordination of <HI>Timothy</HI> by the laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;bytery; producing only tho&s;e arguments that had been u&s;ed an hundred times over to prove, that this was an ordination by Pre&s;by|ters? I am e&s;&s;entially mi&s;taken in the Doctor, and that convened body which fir&s;t put him up|on writing, if they would not have laughed at the mention of &s;uch an in&s;tance, in oppo&s;ition to the above affirmation, and treated it with contempt as being altogether trifling. He pro|ceeds, 'Is it not very extraordinary, that he (Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>) &s;hould &s;o roundly repeat the de|mand without the lea&s;t notice of Mr. <HI>Leaming</HI>'s an&s;wer?' The Doctor will not venture to &s;ay, he had not read the following words of mine concerning Mr. <HI>Leaming,</HI> in the letter prefixed to Mr. <HI>Welles</HI>'s an&s;wer to him, 'Was I inclined to engage in the epi&s;copal controver&s;y, I &s;hould chu&s;e for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a di&s;pute, than he appears to me to be.' This is &s;ufficient to account for my re|petition of the demand, when &s;o fair an occa&s;ion was offered for it. The Doctor will doubtle&s;s think it &s;ufficient. And as to my doing this 'without taking the lea&s;t notice of Mr. <HI>Leam|ing</HI>'s an&s;wer,' the plain truth is, I did not e&s;teem it worthy of the lea&s;t notice, or that any one el&s;e would, that had any con&s;iderable degree of in|tellectual di&s;cernment. Be&s;ides, the Doctor knows Mr. <HI>Welles</HI> had wrote an an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Leaming,</HI> in which he nullified this produced in|&s;tance,
<PB N="79" REF="011598_0040_0F877A656616BF68">
and all that was &s;aid upon it; particu|larly &s;ignifying to him, and to the Public that, the example of epi&s;copal ordination wanted, and de&s;ired, was to be &s;elected, not from the <HI>&s;crip|ture,</HI> but from one or another of the FATHERS of the two fir&s;t centuries: Notwith&s;tanding which, the Doctor has carefully avoided a com|pliance with my demand; though repeatedly made, and &s;o particularly explained as not to be capable of being mi&s;under&s;tood. How then could he, without blu&s;hing, go on, and &s;ay, 'I have &s;ometimes met with per&s;ons who would al|ledge the arguments of <HI>others</HI> that had been an|&s;wered, and the objections of <HI>others</HI> that had been confuted [He is him&s;elf an eminent in&s;tance of this] without taking notice of the &s;aid an&s;wers and confutations; but Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> is the fir&s;t man I have found in any of the regions of con|trover&s;y, that could, without any &s;ymptoms of perturbation, deal thus with <HI>his own</HI> arguments and objections, after they had been formally an|&s;wered and confuted.'&mdash;One cannot help think|ing that the Doctor found him&s;elf greatly puz|led, not knowing what to &s;ay. To give the de&s;ired in&s;tance was not in his power&mdash;To de|clare that it was not, would have had an ill a&s;|pect on the cau&s;e he was defending&mdash;To &s;ay no|thing might have le&s;&s;ened his reputation as the &s;elected epi&s;copal-champion. The be&s;t method therefore was to &s;ay &s;omething, though it &s;hould not be to the purpo&s;e; but to do it in the u&s;e of language that might lead ignorant readers to imagine, that he had effectually done the bu&s;ine&s;s. If the Doctor can give a better account of his conduct, let him do it.</P>
<P>HE now knows, if he is capable of being made to know, that what I de&s;ire is, an in&s;tance
<PB N="80" REF="011598_0041_0F877A662FCB1F68">
of EPISCOPAL ORDINATION, in the appropria|ted &s;en&s;e, from &s;ome or other of the FATHERS within an hundred and fifty years from CHRIST. The demand, he owns 'is fair;' and it is mode&s;t likewi&s;e, as ONE INSTANCE ONLY is required, which he may fetch from any part of the then chri&s;tian world. He is either able to give an in&s;tance, or he is not. If he is able, let him do it; and I will frankly acknowledge, in the face of the world, that I have been mi&s;taken: If he is not able, let him as frankly and openly acknow|ledge it, and not divert his readers with telling them of <HI>curio&s;ities</HI> and <HI>extraordinaries</HI> in the re|gions of controver&s;y, which have no exi&s;tence but as creatures of imagination. I &s;hall only add, as I am in &s;ome &s;ollicitude for him, le&s;t he &s;hould not be able, meerly of him&s;elf, to pro|duce the de&s;ired in&s;tance, I would advi&s;e him to call in the aid of the learned convention, of which he is a member; or if they &s;hould not be &s;uf|ficient, let him &s;eek further help from any of the epi&s;copal Clergy on the American Continent. It is really worth his while to be at &s;ome pains in this matter; for unle&s;s he produces the de|manded in&s;tance of ONE EPISCOPAL ordination, he cannot, with any tolerable face, in time to come, a&s;k for an example of ordination by PRES|BYTERS: Nor may he think he is at all wrong|ed, if we give no credit to his word, &s;hould he hereafter &s;ay, as he has done, (p. 63) That 'we know, by the be&s;t hi&s;torical evidence, that it has been the UNIVERSAL practice of the church, from the TIME OF THE APOSTLES TO THE PRESENT HOUR, TO ACKNOWLEDGE NONE for BISHOPS, WHO WERE NOT ORDAINED BY OTHER BISHOPS.' And for his encouragement I now publicly a&s;&s;ure him, that I will receive as <HI>ge|nuine</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="011598_0041_0F877A662FCB1F68">
any in&s;tance he may be able to bring from the certainly <HI>&s;purious,</HI> or <HI>interpolated,</HI> epi&s;tles of IGNATIUS, the great oracle of Epi&s;copalians.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o con&s;ider the ex|ample of the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> which I had mentioned in proof of ordination by Pre&s;byters. And he &s;ays here, in direct oppo&s;ition to as known a truth as is contained in hi&s;tory, 'That the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> were Epi&s;copalians; yea, '&s;uch high-flyers that they claimed an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in a line of Bi&s;hops as &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters.' If he had affirmed this of the church of Scotland, it would not have been more di&s;tant from the truth. Nothing is more evident, than that, among the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> long before they had that name, and from the twelfth century when they were thus denominated, ordination was performed by co|ordinate Pa&s;tors, or Pre&s;byters, a&s;&s;embled in &s;y|nods; as may be &s;een in the account of the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> publi&s;hed by <HI>Paul Perrin</HI> of Lyons, under the head of di&s;cipline. Nay, that famous Epi&s;copalian, Dr. <HI>Reignolds,</HI> who more than equalled in learning either <HI>Mo&s;|heim,</HI> or Dr. <HI>Alix,</HI> peremptorily affirms, in his let|ter to Sir <HI>Francis Knolls,</HI> that the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> were of the &s;ame opinion with <HI>Aerius</HI> as to the identi|ty of the order of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters. The unknown writer of the an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Owen,</HI> to whom the Doctor is obliged for his account of the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> indeed &s;ays, 'They did affirm, that they had lawful Bi&s;hops, and a lawful un|interrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the Apo&s;tles to this day'&mdash;But we all know the equivocal u&s;e of the name Bi&s;hops; and that it may as well mean officers in the church of the &s;ame order with Pre&s;byters, as of a &s;uperior order. In the latter &s;en&s;e, the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> never pretended to have
<PB N="82" REF="011598_0042_0F877A66D91BA490">
<HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> or a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of them from the Apo&s;tles, as is evident from the general &s;train of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical hi&s;tory; in the former, they might po&s;|&s;ibly affirm this. It is mo&s;t probable this author, or the writer he quotes from, confounded the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> with the Bohemians; though it is not true, even in this view, that the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;poken of, would be plea&s;ing to the Doc|tor. For the epi&s;copacy of the Bohemian church was not &s;uch an one as he is a &s;tickler for. Says the learned <HI>Comenius,</HI> in his ratio di&s;ciplinae fra|trum Bohemorum, (p. 19, 20.) 'It is true, the Bohemians have certain Bi&s;hops, or &s;uperinten|dants, who are con&s;picuous for age and gifts, and cho&s;en by &s;uffrages of all the mini&s;ters for the keeping of order, and to &s;ee that all the re&s;t do their office. Four, or five, or &s;ix &s;uch have they, as need requires; and each of the&s;e has his dioce&s;s. But then the dignity of the&s;e, be|yond the other mini&s;ters, is not founded in the prerogative of honours and revenues, but in that of labors and cares beyond others. Accor|ding to the canons of the Apo&s;tles, a Pre&s;byter and Bi&s;hop are one and the &s;ame thing; only a Bi&s;hop among them &s;ignifies an in&s;pector, or &s;uperintendant: And therefore the Bi&s;hops of the unity are in equal honour among them&s;elves, ex|cept that one of them pre&s;ides for the &s;ake of order.'&mdash;But I mu&s;t not enlarge here. I may have &s;aid too much already.</P>
<P>THE Doctor concludes this &s;ection with a few feeble attempts to defend &s;ome part of what he had &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of confirmation. Three texts he brought to view, in his appeal, in &s;up|port of this rite of the church of England. I was particular in taking notice of each of them. To the fir&s;t and third of the&s;e texts he has not
<PB N="83" REF="011598_0042_0F877A66D91BA490">
&s;een fit, no doubt for a very good rea&s;on, to &s;ay a word. In an&s;wer to the &s;econd, he complains of being 'accu&s;ed of unfairly quoting a text of &s;cripture; a crime (&s;ays he) which I hold in ab|horrence&mdash;I am &s;orry Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> could think me capable of committing &s;uch a flagrant act of impiety.' I have carefully looked over what he has offered to exculpate him&s;elf from the crime, he &s;ays, I had charged him with; and &s;hall be glad, if the impartial Pubilc find rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied, 'that he did not &s;uppre&s;s the latter part of a text, becau&s;e if he had given the whole, it would have been at once vi&s;ible to the reader, that it would have been nothing to his pur|po&s;e. I will not &s;ay a word to weaken the effort he has made to clear up his character in this point; but willingly &s;uffer it to be &s;een in its full force.</P>
<P>IF the reader &s;hall think it worth while to turn to the an&s;wer I was particular in making to the two objections again&s;t <HI>confirmation,</HI> the Doctor endeavoured, in his appeal, to remove out of the way, he may, perhaps, be let into the true rea&s;on why he pa&s;&s;ed over what was there offered in total &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDED what I had to &s;ay, on the rite of <HI>confirmation,</HI> with an extract from the di&s;&s;enting Gentleman again&s;t Mr. <HI>White.</HI> The Doctor has thought it &s;ufficient to give us, in an&s;wer, the reply of Mr. <HI>White.</HI> And I &s;hall think it &s;uf|ficient, in return, only to beg the reader to com|pare this reply of Mr. <HI>White,</HI> with my extract from the di&s;&s;enting Gentleman; and if he can bring him&s;elf to think it worthy of the name of a reply, let him repair to what this &s;ame di&s;&s;ent|ing Gentleman has &s;aid in an&s;wer to it, in his fifth &s;ection; more e&s;pecially that part of it
<PB N="84" REF="011598_0043_0F877A67A00BC7F8">
which is contained in p. 172, 173. He will then need nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urther to convince him, unle&s;s he is in a di&s;po&s;ition not to believe that the &s;un &s;hines, though he beholds it in its meridian lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>IT only remains here to a&s;&s;ure the Doctor, in acknowledgment for his advice, that I have not the opinion of Mr. <HI>White</HI> that he has; e&s;teem|ing him no more than a child in compari&s;on with Mr. <HI>Towgood</HI> And this, I believe, is the real &s;entiment of all, in the impartial world, who have had opportunity to read their performances.

<HEAD>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Sections.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Sections, in the appeal, were prin|cipally contrived to give opportunity for a declamatory application to the pa&s;&s;ions; and they were abundantly employed to this purpo&s;e. Nothing that could be thought of, or hyperbo|lical<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y expre&s;&s;ed, was wanting in order to im|pre&s;s the reader's mind with a deep &s;en&s;e of that wretched, deplorable, oppre&s;&s;ed, per&s;ecuted, pe|ri&s;hing condition, the poor church of England in America was unhappily reduced to, through the want of Bi&s;hops in this part of the world. The&s;e topics of harangue, enlarged on in the ap|peal, were particularly replyed to in the an&s;wer to it. The Doctor has &s;aid little that is new or material in 'the defence' he has made. It would therefore be a needle&s;s tryal of the reader's pa|tience to detain him here: However, he will, I tru&s;t, bear with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e while I take &s;ome brief no|tice of a few things, wherein he has gro&s;sly fail|ed in his rea&s;oning, or that fairne&s;s with which he &s;hould have repre&s;ented facts.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;een fit to make two previous remarks. The fir&s;t occa&s;ioned by his &s;aying, 'none but
<PB N="86" REF="011598_0044_0F877A686E293AF0">
Bi&s;hops have a right to govern the church, was to this purpo&s;e, 'That it was difficult, or rather impo&s;&s;ible, to conceive how it &s;hould be believed, that none but Bi&s;hops have a right to govern the church, while it is believed, at the &s;ame time, that the King is the &s;upreme Governor of it, according to the article [the Doctor] referred to, which declares that he hath the CHIEF POW|ER, the CHIEF GOVERNMENT in all eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal cau&s;es.'&mdash;The only reply is, 'This matter has already been placed in &s;o full and clear a light, that to enlarge upon it would be paying but an ill compliment to the reader's under|&s;tanding.' I may rather with exact truth &s;ay, if would be an affront to his under&s;tanding to &s;uppo&s;e, that he could imagine what had been &s;aid, in p. 50 and a few pages onwards, relative to the King's &s;upremacy, &s;hould have the lea&s;t tendency to remove away this difficulty, which can be no otherwi&s;e done, than by making both parts of a mo&s;t apparent contradiction true. It may be worthy of the reader's notice here, I had &s;aid, from the &s;everal acts of Parliament, relative to the King's &s;upremacy, that he is ve&s;ted with ALL POWER to exerci&s;e ALL MANNER of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and that Arch Bi&s;hops, Bi|&s;hops, and all other eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, have NO MANNER of juri&s;diction eccle&s;ia&s;tical but BY AND UNDER THE KING'S MAJESTY, who hath full power and authority to hear and determine ALL MANNER OF CAUSES ECCLESIASTICAL. To this the Doctor has not thought fit to &s;ay a word. I had al&s;o been particular in ob&s;erving, 'That whatever authority the Clergy of the church of England, whether &s;uperior or inferior, are ve&s;ted with, it is, in all its branches, re&s;trained, by the STATE, within certain bounds, beyond
<PB N="87" REF="011598_0044_0F877A686E293AF0">
which they have no authority: In&s;omuch, that all the Clergy of the Kingdom, with the Bi&s;hops at their head, have no con&s;titutional right to make the lea&s;t deviation.' To all this, and much more of the like import, the Doctor has made no other an&s;wer, than by referring us to what he had &s;aid in &s;ome preceeding pages con|cerning the King's &s;upremacy, which is &s;aying nothing, becau&s;e nothing is there attempted to be &s;aid in reply to the&s;e difficulties. It will, I am apt to think, be at once obvious to the rea|der, why he did not chu&s;e to point out to us, how NONE BUT BISHOPS have a right to govern the church, when they are &s;o far from being her ONLY Governors, that they are nothing more than SUBORDINATE rulers, and can do nothing in the church but according to the AUTHORI|TATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS of the King and his Parliament.</P>
<P>THE other remark, as the Doctor has repre|&s;ented it, 'relates to the difference betwixt the complaint as made at the head of this &s;ection, and its appearance in the explanation that follows.' The reader here meets with a notable in&s;tance of his critical ju&s;tice, and candid fairne&s;s, in &s;o quoting my words as to find occa&s;ion to remark upon them. For I had, in expre&s;s terms, made the difference between the complaint, and its after-vindication, to con&s;i&s;t, not meerly, or only, in what was &s;aid 'at the head of this &s;ection;' but IN THAT PARAGRAPH, SOME WORDS OF WHICH [namely the&s;e, <HI>none but Bi&s;hops have a right to govern the church</HI>] WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING. This e&s;&s;ential part of the re|marked difference the Doctor has been plea&s;ed intirely to leave out in quoting my words; and unle&s;s he had been thus unfair, there would

have been no propriety or pertinency in the re|ply he has made to them: It is wholly ground|ed on his unaccountably leaving that out, which he ought to have put in. He owns indeed, that he had &s;aid, (ap p. 27) 'The American chur|ches, while without Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be without government;' upon which he &s;ays, 'If he [Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>] had this general expre&s;&s;ion in his view' he did wrong in &s;aying it was at the head of the &s;ection.' He is here chargeable with inexcu&s;able inattention, not to &s;ay any thing wor&s;e. How otherwi&s;e could he have made the &s;uppo&s;ition, 'if he had this general expre&s;&s;ion in view,? when, in pointing out the difference between the complaint, and its vindication, it was, in the mo&s;t plain language, directly held out to view? His in&s;inuating, that 'I did wrong in &s;aying it was at the head of, the &s;ection,' could be intended only to make way for the &s;ingularly beautiful piece of wit that follows, 'Few of his readers, I believe, would ever think of looking for the <HI>head</HI> of a thing in the <HI>middle</HI> of it.' One would naturally &s;uppo&s;e, from &s;o &s;triking a flight of fancy, that 'this general expre&s;&s;ion' was to be found in the <HI>middle</HI> of the &s;ection; whereas, it is the very <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thing, after what is briefly &s;aid by way of introduction, that we meet with. It is not ea&s;y to conceive, how the Doctor came to call the <HI>head</HI> of a thing its <HI>middle</HI>; and upon a mi&s;repre&s;entation too, which any common reader might rectify upon ocular in&s;pection.</P>
<P>HE goes on to &s;ay, with reference to this ge|neral propo&s;ition, without Bi&s;hops the church of England in America mu&s;t be without go|vernment, 'I took notice, that it is to be under|&s;tood in a qualified &s;en&s;e: But &s;urely there can he no incon&s;i&s;tency in this.

It is neither common, nor con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;trict method or good &s;en&s;e, to limit a propo&s;ition that is not capable of limitation. The Doctor's propo&s;ition is of this kind. Can there be government with exceptions and limi|tations, when all right to exerci&s;e government is denied, and for want of this right there is wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery? The complaint there|fore &s;hould not have been in ab&s;olute terms, when a limited mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igated meaning only was intended. This is wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I aimed to &s;how in my remark, and principally with a view to give particular di&s;tinct notice to the reader, that it was in a 'qualified limited &s;en&s;e only,' that I was called to con&s;ider this complaint. It was accordingly in this qualified &s;en&s;e that I did con&s;ider it up|on the head of <HI>ordination</HI> as well as <HI>government,</HI> and in perfect conformity to the &s;en&s;e in which the Doctor him&s;elf endeavoured to vindicate his own complaint. If the reader will only carry this in his mind, when he reads what he has &s;aid (p. 101, 102) he will at once perceive, that the whole of it is a meer vain &s;hew, altoge|ther unworthy of any one who pretends to rea&s;on fairly.

<P>SAYS he, 'As to ordination, the general pro|po&s;ition is true without any exception. For without Bi&s;hops, upon the principles of the church of England, there cannot be ordinati|on in a fingle in&s;tance.' And what then?

He goes on, 'The Doctor [<HI>Chauncy</HI>] di&s;tingui&s;hes; <HI>no ordination, and ordination with inconvenience and charge, are quite different things.</HI>' Who in his &s;en&s;es ever thought, or &s;aid other|wi&s;e? In&s;tead of 'laboring under a great con|fu&s;ion of ideas,' my antagoni&s;t mu&s;t have no ideas but what are different from the ideas of all other per&s;ons, if he can di&s;pute this. But, &s;ays he, 'The po&s;ition which he controverts is this, that there can be no ordination in America, without Bi&s;hops in America.' If he here means, that I di&s;pute whether epi&s;copal ordination can be obtained by Americans, unle&s;s there are Bi|&s;hops in America; it is neither true, nor con|&s;i&s;tent with his own vindication of his own com|plaint; or with my an&s;wer to it.

He goes on, 'In oppo&s;ition to which [the po&s;ition, there can be no ordina|tion in America without Bi&s;hops in America] he argues, that we may have ordinations in America <HI>with inconvenience and charge</HI> But how can we, without Bi&s;hops, have ordination in America? Why, &s;ays my very logical opponent, by having them in England.' The Doctor is here illogical|ly in&s;en&s;ible, that he is &s;neering at him&s;elf.

and the only ones, in the virtue of which he endeavours to &s;upport h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s complaint upon the head of ordination. If therefore there is any thing ridiculous in &s;aying, 'We may have or|dinations in America by having them in En|gland,' he only mu&s;t bear the ridicule; for he is the only per&s;on that made this a matter of complaint; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s more clamarous upon this &s;uppo&s;ed grievance than any other.</P>

<P>THE Doctor, in his 'appeal, p. 34, had com|plained of the <HI>expence</HI> of a voyage to England for ordination; to which the reply was made that is contained in p. 82 of the 'appeal an|&s;wered.' This reply, however candid and ju&s;t, gave occa&s;ion to my being very &s;currilou&s;ly treated in one of the New-York periodical pa|pers: And Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> him&s;elf, in his 'ap|peal defended,' has remarked upon it in a man|ner much below the gentleman, not to &s;ay the chri&s;tian divine. The reader will bear with me, while I &s;et this matter in a clear and full point of light.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid, in the 'appeal,' p. 34, 35, in order to repre&s;ent the di&s;advantage of being obliged to go to England for orders, 'That the expence of this voyage cannot be reckoned at le&s;s, upon an average, than one hundred pounds &s;terling to each per&s;on.

The expence mu&s;t therefore gene|rally fall upon &s;uch, as having already expend|ed the greate&s;t part of their pittance in their education, will find it extremely hard to rai&s;e a &s;um &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e' The&s;e are the Doctor's words, and the whole of them. In reply hereto it was &s;aid, 'appeal an&s;wered, p. 82, 'Anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r rea&s;on [that is, of the di&s;advan|tage attending the affair of ordination] is, the expence of the voyage, which cannot be reck|oned at le&s;s, upon an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erage, than one hundred pounds &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rling to each per&s;on.' And this is aggravated by the con&s;ideration 'that the ex|pence mu&s;t generally fall upon &s;uch, as, hav|ing a ready expended the greate&s;t part of their pittance in their education, will find it extreme|ly hard to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient &s;um for the purpo&s;e.' I candidly &s;uppo&s;e the Doctor had never &s;een, or, if he had, did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remember, at the time of writing the account of the Society, publi&s;hed in 1706, in which they &s;ay, (p 74) 'All young &s;tudents in tho&s;e parts (meaning the Colonies) who de&s;ire epi&s;copal ordination, are invited into England; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Society.' According to this invitation there is no hard&s;hip, as to the article of 'expen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e' that can be com|plained of, unle&s;s ab&s;urdly, but by the Society them&s;elves; and they can have no ju&s;t rea|&s;on for complaint, as the money they expend in this way is as properly be&s;towed, as in the &s;up|port of the mi&s;&s;ionar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es them&s;elves.' This, ver|batim, is what I &s;aid, and all that I &s;aid. Who
<PB N="95" REF="011598_0048_0F877A6B577C44A0">
could have imagined, that what is here offer|ed, in &s;o candid a manner, without &s;o much as an har&s;h or provoking word, &s;hould have been made an handle for the ba&s;e and injurious re|flections that have been ca&s;t upon me!&mdash;But let us hear what the Doctor has &s;aid, in his 'ap|peal defended.' Having owned, (p 124.) 'That I very candidly &s;uppo&s;ed he had never &s;een, or, if he had, did not remember, at the time of writing, the account of the Society, publi&s;hed in 1706;&mdash;he goes on to argue, 'The com|plaint made in the 'appeal' is, that the voyage is <HI>expen&s;ive</HI>; the an&s;wer by Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> is ma|nife&s;tly contrived to excite the idea, that it is not expen&s;ive.' It is really unaccountable he &s;hould be able to move his pen to write thus, when he could not but know, if in &s;eeing he would &s;ee, that my an&s;wer, in the whole of it, was ground|ed upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the voyage was attended with <HI>expence</HI>; nor is there a word in it, from whence it can be inferred, that I did not think this to be a certain truth. He proceeds, 'The complaint &s;ays, the expence, upon an average, is an hundred pounds &s;terling to each per&s;on; the an&s;wer leads the reader to believe, that it is not a farthing.' He &s;hould rather have &s;aid, it leads the reader to believe, that it would not be a farthing, if the Society defrayed the charge conformably to the promi&s;e they publi&s;hed for the encourage|ment of Colony-&s;tudents to go to England for orders. And, as they have never revoked this promi&s;e that we non-epi&s;copa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans know of, (for &s;uch revokation is no where contained, that we can find, in the publi&s;hed accounts of their proceedings) we ought, in honor to them, to &s;uppo&s;e, that they, and not the &s;tudents they
<PB N="96" REF="011598_0049_0F877A6E8BE44408">
have invited into England, are at the expence of the voyage, unle&s;s it is otherwi&s;e defrayed. He &s;ays yet further, 'But this is not the wor&s;t of it; the an&s;wer appears to me to be <HI>artfully</HI> calculated to lead the reader al&s;o to believe &s;omething further&mdash;namely, that concerning a plain matter of fact, with regard to which it is impo&s;&s;ible any Mi&s;&s;ionary can be mi&s;taken, I publi&s;hed to the world an ab&s;olute, wilful fal|&s;hood; a fal&s;hood, which was known to be &s;uch, not only by every Mi&s;&s;ionary on the Con|tinent, but by every member of the Society both here and at home, and by every Bi&s;hop in the Kingdom. So that I fear the Doctor really intended to lead his readers to believe me to have been in this matter, both a notorious liar, and abominably &s;tupid. I have freely mentioned what I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, and what I know to be &s;u&s;pected by many others. If he can exculpate him&s;elf, I think it greatly con|cerns him to do it: Or if any of his friends can clear him, it is in their power to do him a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. Nothing le&s;s, in my opinion, can excu&s;e him to the world, and to his own con&s;cience, than proper evidence that he him|&s;elf believes, and has rea&s;on for believing, that I have actually been guilty of &s;uch ba&s;e and ab&s;urd conduct, as his in&s;inuations manife&s;tly imply'&mdash;It mu&s;t, I &s;hould think, appear to the reader, that the Doctor, in&s;tead of being 'very candid,' has di&s;covered a total want of candor in what he has here &s;aid. He expre&s;sly declares, 'That I had very candidly &s;uppo&s;ed, he had not &s;een, or did not remember, the Society's engagement in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">06; and yet, in direct contradiction to this acknowledged candor, he would lead the reader to think, that it was my intention to
<PB N="97" REF="011598_0049_0F877A6E8BE44408">
repre&s;ent him as an abominably &s;tupid liar. It was in truth my real de&s;ign, explicitly as well as candidly &s;ignified, to guard him again&s;t en|tertaining any &s;uch thought. What other imaginable end could I have had in view? I &s;hould have acted the part, not of an 'art|ful calculator,' but of a weak &s;illy per&s;on, to have made the &s;uppo&s;ition, the Doctor him&s;elf calls a 'very candid one,' if it had been my intention to make the reader believe he was 'a notorious liar,' as having publi&s;hed a known wilful fal&s;hood. What &s;hould lead him '&s;trongly to &s;u&s;pect' this was my de&s;ign, I am not able to conjecture, unle&s;s he felt within him&s;elf a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt in this matter; which might be the ca&s;e. For though I neither &s;aid, nor intended to &s;ay it before, I &s;ay it now in plain words, that he did not declare the truth, how|ever 'impo&s;&s;ible it was that any Mi&s;&s;ionary &s;hould mi&s;take in &s;o plain a matter of fact,' if he intend|ed to make his readers believe, agreeably to the evident import of his words, 'That the expence of the voyage to England for orders, was, to each per&s;on,' out of his own pocket, without exception, 'one hundred pounds &s;terling.' I am &s;ure he did not know this to be true, becau&s;e I know it to be fal&s;e: Nor does any Mi&s;&s;ionary on the Continent know it to be true, becau&s;e the con&s;ciences of &s;ome of them will tell them to their faces, that pious donations have wholly, or in great part, defrayed the expence of their going home for holy orders. It is indeed com|mon in the&s;e parts, however it may be where the Doctor re&s;ides, for candidates to be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their voyage: I believe there are tho&s;e, who have cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic for ordi|nation, without being at any epxence of their
<PB N="98" REF="011598_0050_0F877A6F2AFC3238">
own. It does not therefore belong to me, but to the Doctor, to 'exculpate him&s;elf.' or to get &s;ome friend to do it for him: Nor otherwi&s;e can he 'excu&s;e him&s;elf to the world, or his own con&s;cience,' for what he has here publi&s;h|ed that is not agreeable to truth. How far he might do this 'wilfully,' or '&s;tupidly' or 'no|toriou&s;ly,' or 'abominably,' is be&s;t known to him&s;elf; though I am &s;o candid as to think, that he did it rather through want of due con|&s;ideration, which is a fault he is too apt to be betrayed into.</P>
<P>HE has been plea&s;ed, in a note, at the bottom of p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to in&s;ert the following words, 'The author of a <HI>fictitious</HI> letter from <HI>a member of the Society,</HI> which has been publi&s;hed in one of the New-York papers has endeavoured to vindicate Doctor <HI>Chauncy</HI> from the charges of fal&s;hood and in&s;incerity, which had been brought again&s;t him [in another of the&s;e papers] on account of his conduct in this affair. But, unle&s;s he &s;hould have the good luck to meet with an abler and fairer advocate, his reputation mu&s;t &s;uffer, wherever the ca&s;e &s;hall be known.'

<P>IT may de&s;erve the reader's &s;pecial notice, though the Doctor would, from a <HI>fictitous</HI> writer, in&s;inuate, that I was chargeable with fal|&s;hood, he has not ventured, in his own reply, to exhibit &s;uch a charge.

<P>HAVING made this acknowledgment, he goes on to repre&s;ent the 'invitation of the Society' as nothing to my purpo&s;e. Says he, 'It ap|pears

that it was only occa&s;ional.'&mdash;Very true; but what was the occa&s;ion? The reader will be be&s;t able to judge from the invitation it&s;elf, which I &s;hall here in&s;ert at large; and the ra|ther, that the Public may, from what they &s;hall &s;ee with their own eyes, be indi&s;putably con|vinced, that I have been treated with great di&s;|ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nuity and ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an account of the Society for propagat|ing the go&s;pel in foreign parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> London, printed by <HI>Jo&s;eph Downing,</HI> 1706, p. 74, 75, it is &s;aid, 'All young &s;tudents in tho&s;e parts [the Colonies] who de&s;ire epi&s;copal ordination, are invited into England, and their EXPENCES of coming and returning are to be DEFRAYED BY THE SOCIETY, in pur&s;uance of an ORDER MADE TO THAT EFFECT. And the form of a letter was prepared, and allowed to be &s;ent to the GO|VERNOR OF NEW-ENGLAND, and one of the like importance to the EPISCOPAL CLERGY in tho&s;e parts, encouraging the &s;ending over hi|ther &s;uch young &s;tudents as are inclinable to be ordained, and to embrace the mi&s;&s;ion.'</P>
<P>IN an ab&s;tract of the proceedings of the So|ciety, annexed to Dr. <HI>Kennet</HI>'s &s;ermon, Feb. 15, 1711, 1712, p. 44, is the following pa&s;&s;age, 'The Society apprehending that nothing would more effectually tend to ju&s;tify their good en|deavours, and to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of them, than to INFORM THE WORLD of their founda|tion, e&s;tabli&s;hment, and continual progre&s;s, did agree, that the book, called, 'An account of the Society for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts, with their preceedings and &s;ucce&s;s, Lon|don, for <HI>Jo&s;eph Downing,</HI> 1706, 4 to,' &s;hould be reprinted with a continuation down to the pre|&s;ent time.'</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="011598_0051_0F877A7013395748">FROM the&s;e extracts, it appears, with a meri|dian lu&s;tre, that the Society wanted and de|&s;ired Colony Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and that this was the OCCASION of their publi&s;hing their invitation, wherein they PROMISE to defray the EXPENCE of &s;uch as &s;hall be inclined to go home for holy orders: and this 'invitation' and 'promi&s;e' were, without all doubt, communicated in the 'letter' that was prepared to be &s;ent to the EPIS|COPAL CLERGY, that they might communicate them to the Colony-&s;tudents for their encou|ragement to go home for ordination. And it is ob&s;ervable, five or &s;ix years after the fir&s;t pub|lication of the 'account' in which this invita|tion and promi&s;e are contained, it was agreed and ordered by the Society, that it &s;hould be RE|PRINTED to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of their pro|ceedings. Who now can &s;uppo&s;e, that the printed and reprinted INVITATION and PRO|MISE of the Society ought not to be looked up|on as an obligation lying on them, in point of honour and ju&s;tice, to defray the expence of the voyage to England for orders, unle&s;s it is made known to them that it has been defrayed &s;ome other way?</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays the Doctor, before the fir&s;t candi|dates f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m this Country went home for holy orders, the invitation was recalled, or rather had expired.' He would do well to tell us, how it &s;hould expire, if it was not recalled. And let him, if he can, produce its revokation in any account the Society have given of their proceedings. Until he is able to do this, he mu&s;t excu&s;e us Non-epi&s;copalians, if we are not|able to &s;ee, but that the Society is STILL as &s;trongly obliged as ever to make good their PRO|MISE to the Colony-&s;tudents, unle&s;s it may have
<PB N="102" REF="011598_0052_0F877A719A70BCE0">
been vacated in any in&s;tances by the payment of the expence of the voyage by their epi&s;copal friends here. The Doctor may, if he plea&s;es, call this invitation of the Society an 'antiquated' one, and compare it to 'one of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes again&s;t the <HI>Lollards</HI>;' but it is ea&s;y to perceive, that he here &s;ub&s;titutes laughter in the room of &s;ober argument, and for a very good rea&s;on no doubt. He would ju&s;tify the invita|tion as 'antiquated' by &s;aying, 'That neither the fir&s;t candidates that went home for holy or|ders, nor any of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, <HI>&s;o far as I can learn,</HI> have received benefit from it.' This, if true, is really &s;trange, and reflects no &s;mall di&s;|honor on the Society. But the Doctor, per|haps, may in time make higher attainments in learning of this kind, than he is at pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and find that both the 'fir&s;t candi|dates,' and '&s;ome of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors' too, have received benefit from this invitation and promi&s;e of the Society. I am the rather di&s;po&s;ed to be|lieve, that this is the truth of the ca&s;e, from that re&s;pect which is due to &s;o venerable a body of men; and a&s;&s;ure the Doctor, though he
<Q>has &s;o publicly and boldly a&s;&s;erted</Q>
the contrary, it has no influence to put me upon '&s;u&s;pecting my own ignorance' in this matter. For it is no infrequent thing with him to affirm that, both 'publicly and boldly' which he never would have done, had it not been for want of more knowledge.</P>
<P>HE very ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ures the Public, (p. 153) That 'I will not allow that the church of En|gland, in the Colonies, is di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;tig|mati&s;ed by a want of tho&s;e religious privileges, which are granted to all other denominations;' and for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e 'Epi&s;|copalians
<PB N="103" REF="011598_0052_0F877A719A70BCE0">
are allowed the &s;ame liberty with all other per&s;ua&s;ions, and do, with as much free|dom from mole&s;tation, wor&s;hip GOD in the pre|ci&s;e way they them&s;elves are plea&s;ed to chu&s;e:' Upon which he cries out, 'Can he be &s;erious when he &s;ays this? Or does he mean to in&s;ult us?' I mean to in&s;ult no body; but I &s;eriou&s;ly &s;pake a real truth. 'Is it the truth, that we have the &s;ame <HI>liberty</HI> with all other per&s;ua&s;ions?' I af|firm it is the exact truth. 'Do not they all en|joy their own religious &s;y&s;tems compleatly, and in every part? But can this be predicated of the church of England?' If it cannot, it is not ow|ing to any want of liberty, but to their not u&s;ing that liberty which is equally granted to all deno|minations without di&s;tinction. 'We complain that we are de&s;titute of the power of ordination, and are not allowed to enjoy &s;everal of the in&s;titu|tions of our church, which we hold in great e|&s;teem and veneration'. The an&s;wer is &s;hort and ea&s;y. Epi&s;copalians are as much allowed, as other denominations, to procure for them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he full enjoyment of all the &s;piritual privileges of the Kingdom of CHRIST. Nothing re&s;trains them from deriving, whenever they plea&s;e, or|daining, governing, or any other religious pow|er, in it's pure, naked, &s;imple, &s;piritual nature, which is all they de&s;ire, from the Bi&s;hop in Cana|da, or Penn&s;ylvania; or from a Bohemian or Wal|den&s;ian Bi&s;hop; [it will be no difficulty with the Doctor that he is an high-flying one] if they cannot derive the&s;e powers from an Engli&s;h one: They are indeed at full liberty to ran&s;ack the whole earth, that they may enjoy their tru|ly apo&s;tolic Epi&s;copacy. If other denominati|ons have their own Pa&s;tors and Teachers, their own religious wor&s;hip, government and di&s;ci|pline,

What &s;hould h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der?

Should it be &s;aid, their principles re&s;train them from the procurement of apo&s;tolic Epi&s;copacy in any way but from the King or &s;tate, and by being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all the other Colony-denominati|ons: In this ca&s;e, the reply was given in the an&s;wer to the appeal, in the&s;e words, 'It is from their principles only that they are hamper|ed with difficulties.' The Doctor, upon this, has di&s;covered, as he had often done before, that his peculiar talent is not that of rea&s;oning. He can perceive no difference between difficul|ties, &s;uffered upon principle, in con&s;equence of the non-be&s;towment of di&s;tingui&s;hing favour, and difficulties that are &s;uffered for not com|plying with the arbitrary, tyrannical precepts of men, in violation of the rights of con&s;cience&punc; Yea, he would make us believe, that difficulties &s;uffered, upon principle, through want of a grant of favour, may, with as much pertinency, be complained of, as any of the tortures the Saints of the Mo&s;t High have been harra&s;&s;ed with, for their adherence to their GOD, from
<PB N="105" REF="011598_0053_0F877A7238556AD0">
the greate&s;t per&s;ecutors that ever exi&s;ted. I &s;hall only &s;ay here, for once borrowing the Doc|tor's own polite words, 'This is the weake&s;t of all the weak things he has &s;aid.'</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved, ap. an&s;. p. 130, 131, 'That the Non-epi&s;copalian Clergy and Laity, in the town of Bo&s;ton, in one week only, &s;ub&s;cribed two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for a fund to &s;up|port Mi&s;&s;ionaries among the Indian natives, up|on condition there might be an incorporated &s;ociety among them&s;elves for conducting and managing this important affair; that an incor|porating act was prepared, and pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;everal branches of the government here, and &s;ent home for the Royal &s;anction, without which it could not continue in force: But that it &s;oon met with a negative, by means of which this whole money was lo&s;t, and as much more we had good rea&s;on to expect would be &s;ub&s;cri|bed.' This was complained of as a great hard|&s;hip. And it was then added, 'We &s;hould e&s;teem the hard&s;hip much greater, if, in any mea&s;ure, it was brought upon us by EPISCOPAL influence. I will not too po&s;itively &s;ay it was; but this I will &s;ay, and in the words of a letter from home.'&mdash;The words were in&s;erted at large. What now &s;ays the Doctor? In&s;tead of taking the lea&s;t notice of this letter, he mentions it, from one he calls the very &s;en&s;ible author of a vindication of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's &s;ermon, as 'an utter improbability, that a number of eminently pious men, who have the conver&s;ion of the Savages much at heart, would oppo&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure for that purpo&s;e' I am hear|tily &s;orry I am obliged to &s;ay, that this 'num|ber of eminently pious men' have given the Public &s;o little rea&s;on to think, that they have the
<PB N="106" REF="011598_0054_0F877A72E0507600">
conver&s;ion of the Savages much at heart.' Had this been the real truth, it is impo&s;&s;ible but they &s;hould have done much more than they have ever yet done to promote their conver&s;ion. They have made it abundantly evident, that they had at heart the PROPAGATION OF EPIS|COPACY, much more than the 'conver&s;ion of the Savages;' and, if we may be permitted to judge from their conduct, we &s;hall naturally, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, be obliged to think, they would be in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e any plan for the conver&s;ion of the Savages, that did not propo&s;e to convert them by EPISCOPISING them. He &s;ubjoins, from the &s;ame very &s;en&s;ible author, an extract of a letter, from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the <HI>mo&s;t im|portant</HI> members of the Society to his friend in this Country, in which it is &s;aid, 'The plan, as pre&s;ented, was liable to &s;everal objections; par|ticularly, that the members were to be accoun|table only to them&s;elves. However, the So|ciety made NO OPPOSITION TO IT.' It was not &s;aid, the Society, in their character as &s;uch, made oppo&s;ition to our incorporating act. It may be true, as this letter declares, that the Society made no oppo&s;ition; but it may be as true, notwith&s;tanding what is here affirmed, that &s;ome of its members, and its mo&s;t important ones too, in their private capacity, might oppo&s;e it with their whole influence. The Doctor al|&s;o brings in Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> 'after enquiry upon the &s;pot' as &s;aying, 'I can affirm upon very good authority, that neither the <HI>Society,</HI> nor any <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> AS SUCH, oppo&s;ed the act of the Bo&s;ton a&s;&s;embly.'&mdash;This may be true, and not incon&s;i&s;tent with the account that has been given us by others, who were upon the &s;pot as well as Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> and as capable of
<PB N="107" REF="011598_0054_0F877A72E0507600">
making enquiry as he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be. The letter the Doctor has pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence &s;ays, 'There is rea&s;on to think, an account of the incorporating act was &s;ent to LAMBETH as early as to&mdash;The Arch-Bi&s;hop was prejudic|ed &mdash;Umbrage was taken at the new &s;ociety&mdash; The lea&s;t attempt to take &s;ub&s;criptions here would have blown up the &s;u&s;picions of the church, and &s;ociety, into an open &s;lame.' This account we had from one, who, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, was under as good advantages, as Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> to know the truth of the affair. And it is ob&s;er|vable, Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s affirmation is de&s;ignedly worded with particular guard and caution. 'Neither the <HI>Society,</HI> nor any Epi&s;copalians, AS SUCH, oppo&s;ed the act.' No one ever &s;aid, the <HI>Society,</HI> AS SUCH, made oppo&s;ition; though, not|with&s;tanding what is here affirmed, &s;ome of its members, and even the Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canter|bury, its Pre&s;ident, might be in the oppo&s;ition: And it may, in like manner, be true, that Epi&s;|copalians might u&s;e their influence again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing this act, though they might not do it AS SUCH. His &s;aying, 'it was rejected upon po|litical and commercial rea&s;ons, when there was not one Bi&s;hop pre&s;ent,' may, to weak minds, have a plau&s;ible appearance; but the di&s;gui&s;e is thin, and ea&s;ily &s;een through. It was never imagined, had there been EPISCOPAL influence, but that it would be kept out of &s;ight, in the management of the affair at the board of trade. They mu&s;t been blunderers in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed, if they could not have a&s;&s;igned &s;ome other rea&s;ons of their conduct, than that they had been applied to by Bi&s;hops, or an Arch-Bi&s;hop, though not in their capacity as members of the Society, or as ve&s;ted with the epi&s;copal office. The Doctor now
<PB N="108" REF="011598_0055_0F877A73D17256D0">
&s;peaks of my taking no notice of '&s;o clear and full evidence of the Society's innocence, as one of the &s;trange modern phenomena, which admit not of an ea&s;y &s;olution.' It is at once &s;olved by only &s;aying, it was none of my bu&s;i|ne&s;s to take notice of this evidence, until he had produced it; upon which I have made it very plainly to appear, that, in&s;tead of being 'clear and full evidence,' it is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eality no evidence at all. The reader will, I believe, think it very extraordinary, in the Doctor, to call me to an account for taking no notice of evidence he had not laid before me, and knew not that I had ever &s;een, while, at the &s;ame time, he is him&s;elf chargeable with taking no notice of the letter he had placed before his eyes, containing much &s;tronger counter-evidence. I will not account for this, by &s;uppo&s;ing 'he wrote in a hurry, and did not give him&s;elf time for recollection:' A much better rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned, namely, his finding him&s;elf unable to return a ju&s;t an&s;wer to the contents of &s;o material a letter.</P>
<P>MANY other things, contained in this part of the Doctor's defence are ju&s;tly liable to excep|tion; but he de&s;ires 'the controver&s;y may be brought into a narrower compa&s;s; and the rea|der, I imagine, will think with me, that it would be needle&s;s to take any further notice of what is here &s;aid, as being remote from the GRAND POINT in di&s;pute. To this therefore I &s;hall now immediately proceed.</P>

<HEAD>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Eighth Section.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctor comes, in this &s;ection, to in|validate the objections that had been brought again&s;t the propo&s;ed plan for an Ame|rican-Epi&s;copate. And here it might have been expected to find him exerting him&s;elf <HI>with</HI> the greate&s;t vigor and &s;trength. But we are greatly di&s;appointed. He di&s;covers le&s;s &s;pirit, and is le&s;s convincing, in what he has offered upon this MAIN POINT in controver&s;y, than in any part of his performance. He &s;eems indeed to have kept this GRAND OBJECT out of &s;ight as long as he could, if we may judge from the 198 pages he wrote before he came to it. And it would have been, perhaps, as much to his ho|nor, if he had wholly pa&s;&s;ed it over in &s;ilence, unle&s;s what he has &s;aid had carried more weight with it.</P>
<P>BEFORE he enters upon the con&s;ideration of the objections to the epi&s;copal plan for Ameri|ca, he takes notice of two or three other things, which mu&s;t detain us a while.</P>
<P>IN the 'appeal an&s;wered,' in a marginal note at the bottom of p. 133, mention was made of a copy, that had appeared in one of the public news-papers, of the petition that was &s;ent by a
<PB N="110" REF="011598_0056_0F877A745C7BE2A8">
number of epi&s;copal Clergymen to the Univer&s;ity at Cambridge, in which &s;ome things ju&s;tly ex|ceptionable were pointed out. The Doctor's reply is, 'I can and do a&s;&s;ure him [Dr. <HI>Chaun|cy</HI>] that it is fictitious and fal&s;e; and that the Convention &s;ent home no &s;uch addre&s;s, nor any that contained &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions with the&s;e he cen&s;ures.' I al&s;o can and do a&s;&s;ure Dr. <HI>Chand|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> that it would have given both my&s;elf, and the Public, much greater &s;atisfaction, if he had here in&s;erted a copy of the petition it&s;elf, properly au|thenticated. We might then have judged for our|&s;elves, and not been put upon yielding implicit faith in his bare word; which though true in his own apprehen&s;ion, might po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e in the view of others. Whatever the Doctor, or the Convention may think, it carries with it no good a&s;pect, that they &s;o re&s;olutely keep &s;ecret their petitions, when copies of them have been de&s;ired; putting us off by telling us, they do not contain that in them which we have heard they do, and in &s;uch ways that we &s;hall believe what we have heard, until we have opportunity to &s;ee with our own eyes.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid, ap. an&s;w. p. 135, 'Some of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians, in the&s;e parts, for &s;obriety, good &s;en&s;e, and a &s;teady attachment to the intere&s;t of the church of England, have declared it to be their opinion, that Bi&s;hops would be of no &s;ervice here, and that they did not de|&s;ire they &s;hould be &s;ent.' The Doctor, upon this, affects to be at a lo&s;s to know what 'pe|culiar idea' I intended to convey by the phra&s;e 're&s;pectable Epi&s;copalians;' which could not ea&s;ily be accounted for in any other per&s;on, as I was particular in repre&s;enting them re&s;pectable 'for their &s;obriety, good &s;en&s;e, and &s;teady at|tachment
<PB N="111" REF="011598_0056_0F877A745C7BE2A8">
to the church of England.' He is much puzled to under&s;tand the meaning of the 'indefinite word, SOME;' whether I intended by it 'two, or two hundred.' It could not well have been 'impo&s;&s;ible' for him to have known my meaning, in the u&s;e of this innocent word, if he had only allowed him&s;elf to read the imme|diately following &s;entence. 'And it is to me, as well as to MANY I have conver&s;ed with upon this head, EPISCOPALIANS among others, very que&s;tionable, whether, if the members of the church of England, in the&s;e northern Colonies, were to give their votes, and to do it without pre|vious CLERICAL influence, they would be found to be on the &s;ide of an American Epi&s;copate.' One might 'po&s;&s;ibly' have gue&s;&s;ed at what I meant by the word, SOME, after this explana|tion of my&s;elf. But the Doctor cho&s;e rather to make a &s;hew of being witty, than to argue; though his wit is wholly grounded upon a par|tial repre&s;entation of what I had &s;aid. He goes on, 'I que&s;tion whether there is an Epi&s;copalian on the Continent, either of a more or le&s;s re|&s;pectable character, including in it &s;ome degree of attachment to the intere&s;t of the church, that has objected again&s;t an Epi&s;copate upon the plan of the appeal.'&mdash;What he here &s;ays, put into plain Engli&s;h, is this; he que&s;tions whether truth can be &s;poken unle&s;s by him&s;elf, and a few others who &s;peak as he would have them. But why does he que&s;tion, whether any Epi&s;copalian has objected to an Epi&s;copate upon his plan? The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e 'he mu&s;t act a very un|natural, incon&s;i&s;tent part. For how ab&s;urd is it for a man, who is attached to the church of En|gland in America, not to wi&s;h its &s;oundne&s;s and health?' And here he goes on repeating, in a
<PB N="112" REF="011598_0057_0F877A7537AA8CA0">
way of argument, what he had often urged be|fore in favour of his American Epi&s;copate. But what is all this to the point? It is a <HI>fact,</HI> not a <HI>&s;peculative truth,</HI> we are now upon. And the Doctor mu&s;t know, unle&s;s he is a great &s;tran|ger to the world, that <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>&s;peculative argu|ments</HI> do not always harmoni&s;e with each other. Be&s;ides, where is the difficulty in &s;uppo&s;ing, that mo&s;t Epi&s;copalians on the Continent may have a quite different notion of the plan for an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, from that the EPISCOPAL CLERGY have of it, who were its ONLY FOR|MERS, and the ONLY PETITIONERS that it might be carried into execution? Might they not be apprehen&s;ive of danger from a plan con|trived by the CLERGY, and &s;ent home for rati|fication, without their con&s;ent, or being applied to for it? Surely, it is not impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould think, notwith&s;tanding all the Doctor has &s;aid, that the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops into the Colonies would do more hurt than good. This, I know, is, in fact, the opinion of MANY Lay-epi&s;|copalians, and, I believe, of the greater part of them in the New-England Colonies. I &s;hall only add here, &s;peculative arguments are no more &s;uted to invalidate the truth of this fact, than they would be to prove that there were no Epi&s;co|palians on the Continent. For it would be a much ea&s;ier ta&s;k to prove it &s;peculatively ab&s;urd there &s;hould be any, than that they &s;hould be again&s;t the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>THE Doctor animadverts upon nothing fur|ther, until he comes to p. 138, where he &s;ays, that 'I objected to their plan becau&s;e I thought it had been illegally &s;ettled.' And for aught any thing he has proved to the contrary, the ob|jection to the plan, for this rea&s;on, &s;tands firm and

un&s;haken. He &s;ays, 'I take it for granted, that what has been done by our friends and &s;uperiors at home relating to it [the plan] has been done without the King's approbation.' And well I might, as we were told of a &s;cheme for the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Colonies, &s;ettled by Clergymen at home, and approbated by Clergymen here, to the <HI>intire n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">glect of his Ma|je&s;ty,</HI> without who&s;e LICENCE, not even the CON|VOCATION have any right to &s;ettle &s;uch a plan, or &s;o much as ATTEMPT to form it. The Doc|tor allows, 'that the two hou&s;es of Convocation have no authority, without a ROYAL LICENCE, to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any canon, by whatever name it might be called, which &s;hould concern either doctrine or di&s;ci|pline.' But &s;ays he, 'This notwith&s;tanding, the Clergy, even in convocation, are &s;till, in &s;everal <HI>inferior</HI> in&s;tances, left perfectly free.' It would be &s;trange, if they were not. But how does this prove, that they are 'left perfectly free' in &s;uch SUPERIOR in&s;tances as the &s;ettlement of a plan for the new modelling the power of Bi|&s;hops? The King's &s;upremacy, as head of the church, is not more nearly concerned in any ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical affair whatever. He goes on, 'The two hou&s;es of Parliament cannot, without a Roy|al licence attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any &s;tatute, more legally than the two hou&s;es of Convocation can enact a canon' This is ex|pre&s;&s;ed very much as it would have been by one who did not under&s;tand the proper rights of Parliament. If the thing meant is, that the two hou&s;es of Parliament, and the two hou&s;es of Con|vocation, are under the &s;ame con&s;titutional re&s;traint, he is entirely mi&s;taken.

<P><PB N="115" REF="011598_0058_0F877A75EE1B40D0">THE Doctor takes occa&s;ion here perempto|rily to declare, 'That I have pronounced all con&s;ultations of their Bi&s;hops for the intere&s;t of religion to be, in general, an infringement of the King's &s;upremacy, unle&s;s a licence for that purpo&s;e is formally granted from the Crown.'

<P>SENSIBLE, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the in&s;ufficiency of all that had before been offered, the Doctor now gives us the following very extraordinary infor|mation.

Why, 'by this charter, or commi&s;&s;ion, the mem|bers are warranted to concert mea&s;ures, and to &s;ettle plans, for the carrying on the de&s;ign of that incorporation in the mo&s;t effectual manner.' Very tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but was it any part of the de&s;ign of that incorporation to '&s;ettle plans' for a new modelled church of England?

<PB N="117" REF="011598_0059_0F877A76AF5B5E08">
Royal &s;upremacy. For it is not meerly a plan for &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, that is incon|&s;i&s;tent herewith; but a plan that propo&s;es their mi&s;&s;ion to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government and di&s;cipline in a manner quite different from that which is enjoined by the au|thority of the King and Parliament. The pro|po&s;ed plan, as 're&s;umed and dige&s;ted with pe|culiar attention;' is of this &s;ort; and there|fore a direct violation of the &s;eventy-third can|on, which enjoins, 'That no Prie&s;ts, or Mini|&s;ters of GOD's word, nor any other per&s;ons &s;hall meet together in any private hou&s;e, or el&s;ewhere, to con&s;ult upon any matter, or cour&s;e to be ta|ken by them, or upon their motion, or direction by others, which may any way tend to the <HI>im|peaching,</HI> or <HI>depraving</HI> of the doctrine of the church of England, or of the book of common prayer, or of any part of the government or di&s;|cipline now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of En|gland, under pain of excommunication <HI>ip&s;o fac|to.</HI>' The Doctor &s;ays here, 'Whoever knows any thing of the hi&s;tory of the times in which the canon was framed, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it was de&s;igned again&s;t a very <HI>different &s;ort</HI> of per|&s;ons from tho&s;e ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rable prelates, who formed and &s;ettled the plan for an American Epi&s;co|pate.' If vene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able prelates at home formed this plan, and epi&s;copal Clergymen here appro|bated it in conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed bodies for the purpo&s;e, they are chargeable with the very crime this can|on was de&s;igned to guard again&s;t; and it is more aggravated in them, than in 'the different &s;ort of per&s;ons' it might be &s;uppo&s;ed would be liable to condemnation by it. He adds, 'And as it was de&s;igned again&s;t a very different &s;ort of per&s;ons, &s;o the words of it <HI>clearly point out
<PB N="118" REF="011598_0060_0F877A7772574C70">
a very different conduct.</HI>' The conduct of the per&s;ons concerned in the forming and approba|ting this plan, is as like that pointed out and condemned, in the canon, as words can make it. There has been 'the meeting together of Prie&s;ts and others;'&mdash;they have met together 'in private hou&s;es or el&s;ewhere;&mdash;and the de|&s;ign of their meeting was 'to con&s;ult upon a cour&s;e to be taken by them, or upon their mo|tion,' in order to affect an alteration 'in &s;ome part of the <HI>government,</HI> or <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> now e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the church of England:' which, without all di&s;pute, is the very fault intended to be te&s;tified again&s;t in the canon. There is no way, indeed, in which this e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of government in the church of England can be more directly and effectually <HI>impeached,</HI> or <HI>de|praved,</HI> than by practical endeavours to get it changed. And it will not be pretended, that this is not the tendency of the propo&s;ed and publi&s;hed plan. Whether the 'combinations and con&s;ultations,' to this end, 'are factious,' or not, mu&s;t be determined by the canon it&s;elf; which certainly &s;uppo&s;es them to be &s;o.</P>
<P>I SAID, in my an&s;wer to the appeal, the pro|po&s;ed plan 'is a plan for altering the govern|ment and di&s;cipline of the church of England in the Colonies.' To which the Doctor replies, 'Does he then believe the canon was intended to &s;ecure the government and di&s;cipline of the church of England in the Colonies? Without this intention the propo&s;al of any alteration in the form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government here can be no violation of the canon.' Why do Colony-epi&s;copa|palians glory in being members of the church of England, if there is no church of England here. And if there is, it is as as rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="011598_0060_0F877A7772574C70">
the canon was intended to guard its e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form of government again&s;t <HI>impeachment</HI> or <HI>depravation</HI> here, as at home. But, &s;ays the Doctor, 'What is the nature and tendency of the alteration propo&s;ed? Is it to deprave the government of the church of England at home? No; it is in reality to honour it, by endeavour|ing to bring the government of the church here much nearer to her pattern, than it is, or can be, while de&s;titute of Bi&s;hops.' One, having no bia&s;s on his mind, would not think it reflected much honour on the government of the church at home to make alterations and amendments in it, before it is thought fit to be exerci&s;ed here. And the &s;uppo&s;ed alteration mo&s;t certainly <HI>de|praves</HI> it, as it re&s;trains Bi&s;hops from the exer|ci&s;e of that government over the <HI>Laity,</HI> they are entitled to, not only from the grant of the King and Parliament, but, as the Doctor believes, of JESUS CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles. He goes on, 'Nor is the plan for a different mode of an Epi&s;|copate for the church of America, any <HI>impeach|ment</HI> of that under which it exi&s;ts in England.' The propo&s;ing, and endeavouring, an alteration e&s;&s;entially carries in it the idea of an impeach|ment. It is not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be altered without being impeached. What imaginable rea&s;on can there be for a change in any mode of government, unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed, in&s;ufficient, imperfect, and not &s;utable to be exerci&s;ed, in tho&s;e re&s;pects at lea&s;t, wherein a change is de|&s;ired and endeavoured. And this is the very thing here meant by its being <HI>impeached.</HI> But, &s;ays the Doctor, 'As to &s;uch externals, the church of England has always allowed them to be things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the circum&s;tances and
<PB N="120" REF="011598_0061_0F877A781B7F4E80">
opinions of different Countries, or even of the &s;ame Country in different ages.

It is an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le thing to &s;ay, 'That circum&s;tances in America require that the ex|ternals of an Epi&s;copate &s;hould be under a re|gulation peculiar to this country.' Epi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">opa|lians <HI>here</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in <HI>England</HI> are members of one and the &s;ame church; and no circum&s;tances, un|le&s;s tho&s;e of a meer worldly nature, which have nothing to do with a purely &s;piritual kingdom, can make it fit, &s;utable, or rea&s;onable, that the mode of an Epi&s;copate &s;hould be different from what it is at home.</P>
<P>THE reader will, perhaps, by this time be di&s;|po&s;ed rather to wonder, than 'laugh,' at the Doctor's 'audaciou&s;ne&s;s' in making &s;o light of the 'fulminations' of an e&s;tabli&s;hed canon again&s;t <HI>impeaching,</HI> or <HI>depraving</HI> the con&s;titutional go|vernment and di&s;cipline of the church of En|gland. He, together with the other framers, approba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d publi&s;hers, of the propo&s;ed plan of <HI>impeachment</HI> would do well to con&s;ider, whether they are not, by the determination of their own church, 'excommunicated' per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE way being thus prepared, we now come to the GRAND POINT in debate, the propo&s;ed plan for an American Epi&s;copate. According to the Doctor's de&s;ire, in his 'appeal to the Pub|lic,' objections were brought again&s;t this plan. He has endeavoured in his 'ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal defended,' to take off the force of them. We &s;hall impar|tially
<PB N="121" REF="011598_0061_0F877A781B7F4E80">
examine what he has &s;aid upon each ob|jection di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>OBJECTION I. 'The government and di&s;ci|pline of the church of England, under the pro|po&s;ed American Epi&s;copate, is injurious both to the church, and the Bi&s;hops that are to pre&s;ide over it.'</P>
<P>'IT is injurious to the church.' And why? 'Becau&s;e it is to operate on the Clergy only. The lay-members of the church of England may not be favoured with the benefit of the governing authority of the Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent.' What &s;ays the Doctor in reply? He rea&s;ons thus, 'If the Laity are not to be affected by the Bi&s;hops au|thority, they are certainly not to be injured by it; that which does not operate at all, produc|ing no effect either injurious, or beneficial. With regard therefore to the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline o|ver the Laity, no benefit is propo&s;ed, and no inju|ry is to be feared.' Is this a fit an&s;wer for the public view? Are not Bi&s;hops appointed, in the &s;en&s;e even of the church of England, for the be|nefit of the Laity, as truly as the Clergy? Are not the Laity as capable of receiving benefit from Epi&s;copal authority, duly exerci&s;ed, as the Clergy? And if they are capable of being bene|fited by the exerci&s;e of this authority, mu&s;t they not be injured, if a &s;top is put to its operation, in relation to them? Its not being permitted to operate at all, in regard of them, is, in the na|ture of the thing, injurious, and in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the benefit that is lo&s;t by this non-permi&s;&s;ion. No one, I believe, before the Doctor ever &s;aid, it was not injurious to deprive the Laity of a &s;piritual priviledge they are &s;up|po&s;ed to be entitled to, and by a grant from JESUS CHRIST. And if CHRIST has grant|ed
<PB N="122" REF="011598_0062_0F877A78D73A78E0">
them this privilege, for their &s;piritual good, what power on earth can ju&s;tly deprive them of it? If &s;uperior Clergymen at home, and infe|rior ones here, &s;hould combine together, and project a plan to prevent their being under the governing authority of Bi&s;hops, they would cer|tainly plan away an indubitable privilege they are entitled to as members of the church of England; and, if they are really Epi&s;copa|lians, they mu&s;t look upon &s;uch treatment as highly <HI>injurious</HI> and abu&s;ive. The Doctor, in an&s;wering this part of the objection, has done no great honour to him&s;elf. He could &s;carce have &s;aid any thing that would have more expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s of what he undertook to defend.</P>
<P>THE propo&s;ed plan was &s;aid to be 'injurious al&s;o to the Bi&s;hops it would have &s;ent to the Colonies.' And for this rea&s;on, 'Becau&s;e they are, in a meer arbitrary manner, re&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of that authority, which, in the judgment of the&s;e very planners, properly be|longs to them, both by apo&s;tolic appointment, and the con&s;titution of the church of England.' The Doctor replies, 'If &s;uch a re&s;traint is not injurious to the church, it will be difficult to prove that it can be injurious to the Bi&s;hops.'&mdash; It is not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be any other than in|jurious to the church, as it deprives its Laity of a privilege they are as certainly entitled to as the Clergy, and that might be as advantagious to them. But he &s;ays further, 'Are we to con|&s;ider the authority of Bi&s;hops as &s;o much <HI>pri|vate property,</HI> which belongs to them, and every limitation of it as &s;o much <HI>damage</HI> &s;u&s;tained by the Bi&s;hops? And yet, unle&s;s we con&s;ider it under &s;ome &s;uch idea, I &s;ee not how it can be made out, that any <HI>prudent</HI> re&s;traints of their
<PB N="123" REF="011598_0062_0F877A78D73A78E0">
authority can be an injury to them.' Ocular de|mon&s;tration only could have convinced me, that the Doctor was capable of &s;inking &s;o much be|low a man of common under&s;tanding in his rea|&s;oning here. Does he not believe, has he not &s;trenuou&s;ly pleaded, that the governing autho|rity of Bi&s;hops is derived from JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf? And if CHRIST has ve&s;ted Bi&s;hops with their governing authority, is no <HI>injury</HI> done to them, arbitrarily to re&s;train them in the exerci&s;e of this authority? If CHRIST has empowered, and commanded Bi&s;hops to exer|ci&s;e authority over the Laity, as well as Clergy, &s;hall it be deemed no <HI>injury</HI> to be confined in the exerci&s;e of this authority to the Clergy only? It is amazing, one of the Doctor's character &s;hould not be able to &s;ee, that Bi&s;hops were ca|pable of '&s;u&s;taining damage' in other ways be|&s;ides that of being touched in their 'private property!' If he had allowed him&s;elf to con|&s;ider, he mu&s;t have known, that a good Bi&s;hop would have e&s;teemed him&s;elf more highly <HI>injured</HI> by being re&s;trained in the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of the au|thority committed to him by CHRIST, than by &s;uffering in his private property.' A <HI>total</HI> re&s;traint of authority over the Laity is here cal|led a 'prudent one; but it can be &s;o, only in regard of political worldly ends to be an&s;wer|ed by it. I entirely agree with the Doctor in what he adds, 'He that is fond of exerci&s;ing power for the &s;ake of exerci&s;ing it, without re|garding whether it tends to edification or de|&s;truction, is unworthy of it.' But what he aims at proving by this is beyond me to find out. Surely he will not &s;ay Bi&s;hops are &s;o fond of the de&s;tructive power here de&s;cribed, as to make it expedient to re&s;traim them from the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="124" REF="011598_0063_0F877A7A5B93B910">
any power at all over the Laity! And unle&s;s he means this, I &s;ee not to what end he has made the remark. And, in every conceivable view of it, it holds as &s;trong again&s;t their having pow|er over the Clergy as over the Laity. This is all he has thought fit to &s;ay in an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objection. The reader can have no ju&s;t idea of the utter in&s;ufficiency of this reply, unle&s;s he compares it with the objection, as &s;tated and il|lu&s;trated in the 'appeal an&s;wered.'</P>
<P>OBJECTION II. 'The Bi&s;hops, in this plan, are &s;o widely different from the Bi&s;hops of the church of England at home, that it is not rea|&s;onable they &s;hould be de&s;ired, or &s;ent.' The Doctor &s;ays, in an&s;wer, 'The Bi&s;hops, in this plan, are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> the &s;ame with the Bi&s;hops at home, how widely &s;oever they may differ in &s;ome circum&s;tances.' Can they be <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> the &s;ame, if they are <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> re&s;trained in the exerci&s;e of that authority which is proper to their office, and they have full &s;cope to exerci&s;e at home? And yet, this is the exact truth. It is expre&s;sly propo&s;ed, that they &s;hall have no rule over the Laity; that is, that they &s;hall be deprived of one half of that authority, as to its exerci&s;e, which is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to them as Bi&s;hops. He goes on, 'But let them be never &s;o different, if &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are propo&s;ed are fitter for the Colo|nies, than &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are in England, then it may be rea&s;onable that they &s;hould be both de&s;ired and &s;ent.' The plain an&s;wer is, they are not fitter for the Colonies, than for the Mo|ther-Country; and it is unrea&s;onable they &s;hould be de&s;ired for, or &s;ent to, the Colonies, until they are fir&s;t enjoyed at home. It was &s;aid in illu&s;trating this objection, 'Shall a compara|tive handful of epi&s;copal profe&s;&s;ors, mo&s;t of whom,
<PB N="125" REF="011598_0063_0F877A7A5B93B910">
in many of the Colonies, are &s;o in&s;ufficient as that they are upheld in Being, with re&s;pect to their religious denomination, at the charitable expence of a di&s;tant Society;&mdash;&s;hall the&s;e ima|gine them&s;elves &s;o important as that, for their &s;akes, the powers and appendages of Bi&s;hops &s;hall be &s;o mightily abridged? Surely the whole body of Di&s;&s;enters in England, and a very con|&s;iderable part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church there, are as well worthy the national attention; and it is as fit, their reque&s;ts, often repeated, &s;hould be an&s;wered. When this is done it will be time, and not before, to expect that this plan &s;hould be con&s;idered, and brought into effect.&mdash; To this, and much more of the like import, the Doctor has only &s;aid, That he 'had before giv|en a full and &s;ufficient an&s;wer:' But where, he has not told us; nor can I find that he has any where given &s;uch an an&s;wer, or even attempted to do &s;o. He has al&s;o &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed over what was argued from the doctrine of <HI>uniformity,</HI> made &s;o important a matter in the church of En|gland; as that it would mar the glory of this uni|formity to clothe the &s;ame officers of the &s;ame church not with the &s;ame, but widely differing powers; and that there would not, in this ca&s;e, be the appearance of con&s;i&s;tent regularity in one and the &s;ame eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution.&mdash;This &s;ilence of the Doctor, in an&s;wer to objections he openly 'invited objectors to make, that they might be fairly and candidly debated before the tribunal of the Public,' will, I fear, be con&s;trued to his di&s;advantage, if not to the hurt of the cau&s;e he is defending.</P>
<P>HE goes on to the next con&s;ideration, which is, 'That if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies, with the&s;e re&s;trained powers, unde&s;ira|ble
<PB N="126" REF="011598_0064_0F877A7B18A2BF58">
con&s;equences might be naturally feared, both <HI>here</HI> and at <HI>home.</HI>'</P>
<P>AN unde&s;irable con&s;equence to be feared <HI>here</HI> is, 'That the Bi&s;hops would throw off this re|&s;traint as &s;oon as might be; embracing all op|portunities, and u&s;ing all likely means, to reco|ver tho&s;e appendages to their office they had been deprived of.' This was &s;aid, and &s;hewn, to be no unrea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition. The Doctor replies, 'Was it ever before offered as a rea&s;on, why exorbitant power &s;hould not be limited, (and &s;uch the Doctor e&s;teems to be the power of Bi&s;hops in England) becau&s;e the per&s;ons cur|tailed would endeavour to throw off the re&s;traint as &s;oon as may be?' This que&s;tion, as thus ge|nerally put, is quite be&s;ide the ca&s;e. We never objected to the propo&s;ed limitation of the power of Bi&s;hops, as being in it&s;elf, in its own pro|per nature, unrea&s;onable and unfit; but to the confinement of it to the Colonies: and for this good rea&s;on, among others, that it would &s;trong|ly tend to defeat it&s;elf. The Bi&s;hops under a re&s;traint of their power <HI>here,</HI> would naturally be di&s;po&s;ed to throw it off, if the like re&s;traint did not take place at <HI>home</HI>; and they would have this plau&s;ible plea to make in their own ju&s;tifi|cation, that they aimed at nothing more than was allowed to be rea&s;onable and proper in En|gland. The plain truth is, if the exorbitant power of Bi&s;hops ought to be re&s;trained at all, it is as rea&s;onable it &s;hould be re&s;trained at <HI>home</HI> as <HI>here</HI>; and it is a good rea&s;on, why it &s;hould not be re&s;trained there, that &s;uch an unfair, partial, and unju&s;t re&s;traint would, in all probability, through the lu&s;t of power, which even Bi&s;hops are not totally delivered from, &s;oon come to no|thing here. But &s;ays the Doctor, 'Why are
<PB N="127" REF="011598_0064_0F877A7B18A2BF58">
we to &s;uppo&s;e, that the American Bi&s;hops will be unea&s;y under &s;uch a limitation of their pow|er, as the plan expre&s;&s;es?' The rea&s;on is obvi|ous, namely, becau&s;e Bi&s;hops have di&s;covered, in all pa&s;t ages, that corruption was &s;o far unmor|tified in them, as to con&s;i&s;t with a &s;trong incli|nation to enlarge the &s;phere of their power, whenever they had any plau&s;ible pretence here|for; as they certainly would have in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e. But 'whatever power or privilege, they [the propo&s;ed Bi&s;hops] &s;hall once po&s;&s;e&s;s, by virtue of their office, they will continue to hold, as long as they &s;hall remain in the office; and as they know the terms before they accept of it, there can be no di&s;appointment. And why &s;hould they be unea&s;y, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hops at home are inve&s;ted with civil authority? The Bi&s;hops at home may as properly be unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s, becau&s;e they are not, like &s;ome of their order on the Continent of Europe, &s;overeign Princes.' Some Bi&s;hops at home, in times pa&s;t, whatever may be the truth at this day, were un|ea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s for want of more honour and power; and, without all doubt, would have u&s;ed any means, could they probably hoped for &s;ucce&s;s in the u&s;e of them, in order to their be|ing as '&s;overeign Princes' as any 'Bi&s;hops on the Continent of Europe.' And no &s;ecurity can be given us, if the de&s;ired Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent, and upon the propo&s;ed plan too, that they would not be &s;oon &s;o 're&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y,' as to affect that very change, in their re&s;trained dig|nity and power, which is &s;o much feared. The Doctor goes on, 'Perhaps the unea&s;ine&s;s of the American Bi&s;hops may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the reflection, that, de&s;titute as they are of civil power, they are Bi&s;hops of the &s;ame church with
<PB N="128" REF="011598_0065_0F877A7E8C5F6390">
their brethren in England.' And it may natu|rally be &s;uppo&s;ed, they would be 'unea&s;y,' if not at fir&s;t, yet, in a little time, from the re|flection, that they were deprived of that power, it is as rea&s;onable they &s;hould be ve&s;ted with, as their brethren of the &s;ame church, and in pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame office, at home. But 'they will not be able to avoid this further reflection, that they are Bi&s;hops of the &s;ame church in <HI>dif|ferent</HI> countries, and under <HI>different</HI> circum|&s;tances; which e&s;&s;entially alter the ca&s;e.' It is not probable they would ever make this re|flection, as there would be no ju&s;t rea&s;on for their &s;o doing. It is, in truth, nothing better than a vain pretence. The &s;ame epi&s;copal-mode of church government is as proper for the Mo|ther-Country, as the Colonies. Nothing in the &s;ituation of America, or in the circum&s;tances of the Country, or of the Epi&s;copalians in it, can make it rea&s;onable, or fit, that the epi&s;copal-mode &s;hould be 'different' here from what it OUGHT to be at home, unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Kingdom of CHRIST is not that &s;pi|ritual one he has declared it to be, but a King|dom who&s;e government is founded on worldly policy, and is to be &s;upported upon principles of the &s;ame kind. What but the wi&s;dom of this world could ever lead any man to think, that the profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples of the &s;ame LORD, of the &s;ame religion, and of the &s;ame &s;ubjection to the &s;ame &s;piritual government, &s;hould be dif|ferently governed, becau&s;e they happen to live in different places? No con&s;iderations, but tho&s;e of this world, can be mentioned, that will ju&s;|tify, as rea&s;onable, that epi&s;copal mode of go|vernment here, which will not render it equally fit in England. Says the Doctor yet farther,
<PB N="129" REF="011598_0065_0F877A7E8C5F6390">
'This &s;ame kind of rea&s;oning would operate as &s;trongly again&s;t epi&s;copal <HI>Clergymen</HI> in America, as again&s;t Bi&s;hops. The Clergy of the church of England at home, are, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upported by tythes; therefore, it may be &s;aid, if <HI>Clergymen</HI> of the church of England are once admitted in this Country, under whatever re|&s;trictions and limitations, they will not be ea&s;y, until they &s;hall have &s;ecured to them&s;elves the tythes of our e&s;tates.' The fact here &s;uppo&s;ed is, I believe, &s;trictly true, that the Clergy of the church of England will never be '<HI>ea&s;y</HI> until they have &s;ecured to them&s;elves' from our e&s;tates here, what will be, in &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ignifi|cation, the &s;ame thing with the tythes in En|gland. The Doctor him&s;elf very obviou&s;ly, however unde&s;ignedly, led us to &s;u&s;pect this in &s;ome hints he dropped in his appeal; and that is attempting to be done, or actually is done, at home, re&s;pecting GLEBE-LANDS for the church of England in America, which puts it beyond all doubt. But this notwith&s;tanding, we object not again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of epi&s;copal Clergy|men, or even Bi&s;hops, into America, if they have no authority, but that which is 'altogether from CHRIST,' and not from this world.</P>
<P>AT <HI>home,</HI> it was &s;aid, two ill con&s;equences might be looked for. One was, 'That va&s;t numbers there, who have long complained of the too largely extended power claimed and ex|erci&s;ed by Bi&s;hops, might think them&s;elves hard|ly treated, that no regard &s;hould be paid to their intreaties, while a comparatively few incon&s;i|derable profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England in America are heard, and an Epi&s;copate &s;ettled for them according to their mind.' To this the Doctor an&s;wers, 'The reader can hardly avoid
<PB N="130" REF="011598_0066_0F877A800DDC2FF0">
remarking, that here, and in many other places, the Doctor forgets his proper bu&s;ine&s;s and cha|racter. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to an&s;wer the appeal upon the principles of the Di&s;&s;enters; but in|&s;tead of this, he frequently endeavours to rai&s;e difficulties and objections which cannot pro|perly be made, but upon principles oppo&s;ite to his own, and of tho&s;e whom he repre&s;ents, in this controver&s;y.' The Doctor has injudici|ally mi&s;placed this remark. Had he made it under the former objection, it would have ap|peared more plau&s;ible. As brought in here, it is really a blunder. Surely, Di&s;&s;enters at home might, in their proper character as &s;uch, complain of hard treatment, &s;hould the reque&s;t be granted to a few comparatively incon&s;iderable American Epi&s;copalians, which, for a long time has been, and &s;till is, denied them; though the reque&s;t from them is equally rea&s;onable. It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible but that they &s;hould feel, and groan under, &s;uch partiality. But, upon what|ever principles this, or any others, difficulty is rai&s;ed, it is proper, if a real one, it &s;hould be mentioned by way of objection, as objections of all kinds were called for. And the Doctor is now informed, if he needs information, that tho&s;e he improperly calls <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this part of the world, are, upon chri&s;tian principles, in real earne&s;t that the epi&s;copal LAITY may not be impo&s;ed on by their planning Clergy. The former objection, under which the Doctor's pre|&s;ent remark would have been more pertinent, was principally made with a view to &s;erve them; as there has been a combination of their Cler|gy to carry into execution, &s;o far as they were able, a &s;cheme they had contrived for their own &s;akes, to the intire neglect of them; though
<PB N="131" REF="011598_0066_0F877A800DDC2FF0">
much more worthy of the mo&s;t ample pro|vi&s;ion they could have made for their &s;pritu|al profit, under the government of the de|&s;ired Bi&s;hops. The Doctor goes on, 'It will never be admitted as an objection <HI>coming from the Di&s;&s;enters here,</HI> or in England, that many at home will grow more clamorous again&s;t the pre&s;ent power of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, in con&s;e|quence of the &s;ettlement of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed for the Colonies.' What bu&s;ine&s;s had the Doctor with tho&s;e he calls <HI>Di&s;&s;enters here,</HI> when the objected difficulty was the un|ea&s;ine&s;s the propo&s;ed plan might give the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters at home?</HI> Be&s;ides, he ought to have known, there are no <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in any of the Co|lonies to the northward of Maryland, unle&s;s <HI>epi&s;|copal</HI> ones. Moreover, it was not mentioned as an objection, that Di&s;&s;enters at home would 'grow more clamorous in con&s;equence of the &s;ettlement of the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate&punc;' This he repre&s;ents as my objection, but without any ju&s;t foundation from what I had &s;aid. There is a great and wide difference betwixt Di&s;&s;enters being 'clamorous again&s;t the power of the En|gli&s;h Bi&s;hops,' upon the &s;ettlement of the pro|po&s;ed Epi&s;copate here, and their 'thinking them|&s;elves hardly treated, that no regard &s;hould be paid to their intreaties, while a few compara|tively incon&s;iderable Epi&s;copalians, in America, are heard, and an Epi&s;copate &s;ettled for them according to their mind.' The&s;e were my words, and they contain a ju&s;t rea&s;on for &s;uch &s;en&s;ati|ons as naturally ari&s;e from hard and partial treat|ment, which there may be without being at all 'clamorous.' The Doctor has only this to &s;ay further here, 'Should the objection be made by any who have a right to make it, it is &s;ufficient
<PB N="132" REF="011598_0067_0F877A80AD0CE1F8">
to refer them to what has been already &s;aid to the purpo&s;e.'&mdash;Surely, if he had a right to 'in|vite objectors to propo&s;e their objections, that they might be fairly debated before the tribunal of the Public.' they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, at lea&s;t by him, to have this right which he &s;eems to que&s;tion. His bu&s;ine&s;s was to point out the impropriety, or in&s;ufficiency, of &s;uch objections as any might make, not to &s;ugge&s;t that they had no right to make them. But what is it he had already &s;aid, to which he refers us? It is in the&s;e words, 'That &s;uch an Epi&s;copate may be erect|ed HERE with ea&s;e; but it cannot be effected in ENGLAND, without &s;ubverting an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and making a very vi&s;ible alteration in the national con&s;titution&mdash;a work never to be undertaken but in the greate&s;t extremity, and, even then, not without a trembling hand.' We have nothing more here than an affirmation of his own opinion; though he knew it was the opi|nion of others equally capable of judging, that he is certainly and gro&s;sly mi&s;taken.&mdash;The propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate could not be erected <HI>here</HI> with that 'ea&s;e' he would in&s;inuate. It would, without all doubt, be the occa&s;ion of effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e, it would have, were it to be erected at <HI>home</HI>; and they would probably be, in proportion, as great and general. As to its '&s;ubverting an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and making a very vi&s;ible alteration in the national con&s;titution,' he has him&s;elf given us a full and &s;ufficient an&s;wer. For he has told us, (p. 205) That 'as to &s;uch externals [as the plan for an American Epi&s;copate would propo&s;e &s;hould be altered] the church of England has al|ways allowed them to be things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the circum&s;tances and opinions of different coun|tries,
<PB N="133" REF="011598_0067_0F877A80AD0CE1F8">
or even of the &s;ame Country in different ages.' Perhaps, he will allow, if he will not the impartial Public will, that the circum&s;tances and opinions of the pre&s;ent age make it as rea&s;ona|ble and fit, as they well can do, that the&s;e AL|TERABLE EXTERNALS &s;hould be ALTERED. And I will venture to &s;ay, it is, in the pre&s;ent day, extremely nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch an alteration &s;hould be undertaken. The &s;ooner the better. And it might, without much difficulty be accompli&s;hed, if gone upon, not 'with a trembling hand,' but a re&s;olution of &s;pirit becoming men and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THE other ill con&s;equence, as the Doctor has been plea&s;ed to repre&s;ent it, is, 'That the Bi|&s;hops in England will be jealous, that an in|va&s;ion of their authority was intended'. I nei|ther &s;aid, nor intended to &s;ay, that any in|va&s;ion of their authority was intended, but on|ly that they 'might ea&s;ily and naturally argue from what was done here to what might, with as much rea&s;on, be done there:' Upon which account, it was further &s;aid, 'It can be &s;carce &s;uppo&s;ed, it &s;hould e&s;cape the thought of our Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops, that the &s;ettlement of &s;uch an Epi&s;copate in America, as is propo&s;ed, may pre|pare the way for &s;uch a change in the power of Bi&s;hops at home, as they would not be very fond of.' To which the reply is, 'I will only remind the Doctor of one circum&s;tance which he happened to forget; namely, that this very plan has been formed and introduced by tho&s;e Bi|&s;hops them&s;elves, and con&s;equently &s;hould they be jealous that any inva&s;ion of their power is therein intended, they mu&s;t be jealous that they have intended to invade it them&s;elves". I can a&s;&s;ure the Doctor I did not forget, that a few Bi&s;hops at home might have an hand in the formation of this plan; but
<PB N="134" REF="011598_0068_0F877A8126B48DD8">
that they all, or generally, had, I have never yet &s;een rea&s;on to believe. But if it was the joint contrivance of them all, it would only ar|gue this, that they were inattentive to what might be the re&s;ult of this plan in the natural cour&s;e of its operation; or that they were above fearing con&s;equences; or, in fine, that they de&s;igned this plan as only an entering wedge to make way for the creation of more Bi&s;hops, who, in proper time, might be clothed with like dignity and power with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE impartial public will judge, whether the Doctor has &s;ucceeded better in his an&s;wer to this, than the foregoing objection. I could wi&s;h, for his own &s;ake, he had acquitted him&s;elf more like a man of thorough under&s;tanding, 'that came prepared' to plead for the truth only, and not 'to object at any rate, rather than not to object at all'</P>
<P>OBJECTION III. 'THE church of England knows no &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are &s;pecified in this plan, nor can they, in con&s;i&s;tency with its con|&s;titution, be &s;ent to the colonies'. As this is an objection e&s;&s;entially de&s;tructive of the propo&s;ed plan, if it exhibits the real truth, it was ju&s;tly expected the Doctor would have been particu|larly careful to demon&s;trate that it did not. And yet, to the &s;urpri&s;e of his readers, the whole he has thought fit to offer is contained in the&s;e words, 'this objection, and all that has been &s;aid to &s;upport it, has been fully an&s;wered already'. What mu&s;t the public &s;ay of his &s;o|lemn call for objections to be fairly debated be|fore their tribunal, when, upon this call's being complied with, by mentioning, and &s;upporting, an e&s;&s;entially important objection, he virtually declines debating on it by dogmatically affirm|ing,
<PB N="135" REF="011598_0068_0F877A8126B48DD8">
'that it has been fully an&s;wered already, and all that has been &s;aid to &s;upport it? And this is the more extraordinary, as he has not re|ferred to the page, or even the part of his book, in which this full and very particular an&s;wer is to be found. I have carefully looked over the whole he had 'already' wrote, and cannot find any thing that re&s;embles the an&s;wer he de&s;cribes. What he has offered upon the King's &s;uprema|cy, page 49, and three or four pages onwards, looks the mo&s;t this way; and this, I conjecture, is what he refers to: But it is far, very far, from being an an&s;wer to 'all that was &s;aid' in &s;upport of the pre&s;ent objection. This I &s;hall now endeavour to make evident to the reader; and may venture, in the doing of it, to engage his attention for a while, without being charged with keeping out of &s;ight the grand point in controver&s;y,</P>
<P>THE plan &s;ays, 'The Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America &s;hall have no authority, but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is de|rived ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not from the STATE. The objection again&s;t this plan is, 'The church of England knows no &s;uch Bi&s;hops, nor can they, in con&s;i&s;tency with its con&s;titution, be &s;ent to the Colonies.' And why? Becau&s;e the con&s;titutional &s;upre|macy of the King is &s;uch, that there can be no Bi&s;hops without his licence for their election; nor, when elected, and con&s;ecrated, can they exerci&s;e any authority, not in purely &s;piritual mat|ters, but BY and UNDER him, and within the limits that have been pointed out by the STATE. They may not vary a title in any one thing per|taining to the exerci&s;e of their authority. How then can their authority be ALTOGETHER from
<PB N="136" REF="011598_0069_0F877A81E7B321B8">
the CHURCH, not from the STATE? If, con|&s;i&s;tently with the con&s;titution, they can ex|erci&s;e no authority, as officers in the church of England, but BY and UNDER the King as SUPREME GOVERNOR. and in exact confor|mity to the ORDERS of the STATE, how is it po&s;&s;ible their authority &s;hould be '&s;uch as is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, not at all from the STATE? This, to ordinary under&s;tandings, looks very like a direct contradiction. In this way of arguing the objection was largely &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>LET us now &s;ee, whether what the Doctor has offered upon the King's &s;upremacy is 'a full an&s;wer to all that has been here &s;aid.' He has cited the thirty-&s;eventh article of the church of England, which contains her doc|trine of the King's &s;upremacy; he has cited al|&s;o the Queen's injunctions to which this article refers: But, it is to be particularly ob&s;erved, in his whole arguing upon this point, he attempts to prove no more than this, that 'the church was believed to have certain powers of a &s;pi|ritual nature, which this &s;upremacy does not in|clude, and which our Princes are &s;o far from pretending to convey, that all manner of right to exerci&s;e them, in their own per&s;ons, is there|in formally and expre&s;sly di&s;claimed.' That this is what he endeavoured to prove, is made indi&s;putably clear from the manner in which he illu&s;trates his argument. Says he, 'Let it be con&s;idered, that every man is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, a King in his own hou&s;e and family; and no cler|gyman has a right to come into it to perform any eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, to admini&s;ter bapti&s;m for in&s;tance, without his leave and con&s;ent. Upon him it altogether depends, whether the
<PB N="137" REF="011598_0069_0F877A81E7B321B8">
Clergyman &s;hall have a proper and <HI>lawful</HI> au|thority to perform this office in his family. But is it not evident, that the giving him that authority is a very different thing, from inve&s;ting him with the general-power to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments? In like manner, as a Kingdom may be con&s;idered as a large family, the King is the political father of this family; and as &s;uch is &s;u|preme over all per&s;ons belonging to it, whether &s;piritual or temporal. And without his con&s;ent or authority, no Bi&s;hop, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;on, can lawfully officiate within his dominions. But the giving this authority, by commi&s;&s;ion, or in any other way, does not convey to any man his &s;acred character; but always &s;uppo&s;es him to have been previou&s;ly inve&s;ted with it, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST.' What the Doctor has here &s;aid, by way of illu&s;tration, is highly exceptionable, and &s;erves little to any other purpo&s;e than to make it certain, that all he aims at proving is only this, that, notwith&s;tand|ing the King's &s;upremacy, it is from CHRIST, not the King, that the authority of Bi&s;hops, as &s;uch, in the church of England, is conveyed to them. It is, with me, beyond all doubt, that his labor upon this head is altogether in vain. The Queen's words, in her injunctions, as quo|ted by the Doctor, are the&s;e, 'Her Maje&s;ty nei|ther doth, nor ever will, challenge any autho|rity, other than that was challenged and lately u&s;ed by the &s;aid noble Kings of famous memo|ry, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, and King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, which IS, and was of antient time, <HI>due to the imperial Crown of this Realm.</HI>' What now is the authority that was challenged and u&s;ed by the&s;e noble Kings? It is nothing &s;hort of this; that they were ve&s;ted with 'ALL POWER

If the Doctor &s;hould be able to prove this to be within the compa&s;s of po&s;&s;ibility, he would di&s;|cover a far higher reach of thought than he has ever yet done But we have no need to enlarge here. Should it be &s;uppo&s;ed, not grant|ed, that the authority of Bi&s;hops does not flow from the Crown, but from the church, which is the utmo&s;t the Doctor has endeavoured to prove, it will not follow from hence, that he has an&s;wered, or &s;o much as attempted to an&s;wer, 'all that is &s;aid in &s;upport' of the objection in debate. Dare he &s;ay, that the authority of the clergy of the church of England, whether &s;upe|rior or inferior, let him derive it from what &s;ource he plea&s;es, can be con&s;titutionally exerci|&s;ed in any one in&s;tance, but as pointed out by the

King and Parliament? Can the whole Clergy of England, with all the power they are ve&s;ted with from CHRIST, make the lea&s;t alteration in the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of wor&s;hip, ordination, or government? Is there any one thing, in the&s;e mo&s;t important religious points, that they can depart or vary from? If now their autho|rity, as to ITS EXERCISE, is intirely under the direction, re&s;traint, and &s;overeign controul of the King and Parliament, how gro&s;sly ab|&s;urd mu&s;t it be to propo&s;e the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, with &s;uch authority only, as is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not at all from the STATE? There are no &s;uch Bi&s;hops in the church of England, nor can there be till the King is deprived of that &s;upremacy, which has been granted to him by acts of Parliament, and the pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment is ei|ther nullified, or e&s;&s;entially altered. It will not be in the power of the Doctor fully to an|&s;wer 'all that has been &s;aid', until he h&aacute;s in|telligiby informed us, how that authority is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not from the STATE, which can be exerci&s;ed, neither in the affair of wor&s;hip, ordination, govern|ment, or di&s;cipline, but BY and UNDER the guidance, controul, and &s;overeignly pre&s;cribed order, not of the CHURCH, but of the STATE: This is his proper bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;This he &s;hould have undertaken in his reply to this ob|jection&mdash;And this is &s;till incumbent on him, if he would entertain the lea&s;t hope, upon ju&s;t grounds, of &s;upporting &s;o &s;trange a pro|po&s;al as that of the mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Bi&s;hops to America, as are unknown to the church of En|gland, and cannot be &s;ent but upon the &s;ubver|&s;ion, or great alteration, of the pre&s;ent eccle&s;i|a&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="011598_0071_0F877A836172E1A8">I SHALL only add, the objection in debate was enforced by ob&s;erving, 'That this depen|dance on the STATE, notwith&s;tanding the de|&s;ired authority ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, is the true &s;ource of all the hard&s;hips and grie|vances, on account of the want of Bi&s;hops in America, that have been &s;o bitterly complain|ed of.

To all which the Doctor has no where dropped a word, though he has 'fully an&s;wered all that was &s;aid.'

<P>OBJECTION. IV.

Nothing more follows from hence, than that he is informed of &s;omething he did not know before. But though he would affect to be ignorant of a real truth, he is free to declare his faith in an imaginary one, namely, 'That a large majority of the &s;everal per&s;ua&s;ions, ex|cepting the people called Quakers, notwith|&s;tanding the declarations that have been publi&s;h|ed again&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments in the gro&s;s, had al|ways a re&s;erve in favour of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of

their <HI>own</HI> religion.' Was it to the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent argument, I could ea&s;ily, notwith|&s;tanding 'the hi&s;torical accounts, and authentic anecdotes, in the Doctor's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,' make it appear, with a meridian lu&s;tre, 'That the Pu|ritans, in the reign of Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth,</HI>' are in|juriou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented in what he has here given us 'from <HI>Maddox</HI>'s an&s;wer to <HI>Neal.</HI>' And he mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s, if I tell him, that we are not &s;urpri&s;ed at his endeavouring to unco|ver the nakedne&s;s 'of his ance&s;tors,' as he is a DESERTER from that GREAT CAUSE which brought them over to this then de&s;olate land: Nor is it beyond what we expected, to find him, and many of the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who are either <HI>pro&s;elites</HI> them&s;elves, or the <HI>&s;ons</HI> of <HI>pro|&s;elites,</HI> fired with extraordinary zeal in propa|gating high-church principles. This has all a|long been the way, on this &s;ide the Atlantic, in which converts to the church, e&s;pecially clerical ones, have endeavoured to give proof of the &s;in|cerity of their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>HE now comes to the point in debate, and agrees with me, 'That if I, and tho&s;e of my per|&s;ua&s;ion, do not de&s;ire an e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;upport of our religious &s;entiments, we cannot be rea|&s;onably blamed, if we are not di&s;po&s;ed to en|courage one in favour of the epi&s;copal Colo|ni&s;ts.' But &s;ays he, 'What has the ca&s;e of re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hments to do with the American Epi&s;copate, which has been offered to the Pub|lic?' He knew, or might have known, that the objection &s;uppo&s;ed they had a great deal to do with it; and, in&s;tead of a&s;king &s;uch a needle&s;s que&s;tion, he &s;hould have evinced, upon the foot of &s;olid argument, that they had no connection with, or relation to, each other. But he con|tents
<PB N="142" REF="011598_0072_0F877A8433BF5468">
him&s;elf with only going on a&s;king, 'Does this plan propo&s;e an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church?' It undoubtedly does. 'Will the execution of it imply, or amount to, any &s;uch thing?' Yes; or it can never be carried into execution. 'Will the in|troduction of Bi&s;hops, who &s;hall have no authority, but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical nature, &s;uch as is derived altogether from the church, and not from the &s;tate; [and &s;o on to the con|clu&s;ion of the plan;] I &s;ay, will the introducti|on of &s;uch Bi&s;hops as the&s;e amount to an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment? Nay, can it have any more a&s;pect again&s;t the civil or religious privileges of the Coloni&s;ts, than again&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Crim Tar|tars'?</HI> Surely the Doctor could not but know, before he a&s;ked the&s;e que&s;tions, that it was only a&s;king, whether we thought there was any weight, or force, in the produced objection. How unaccountable therefore is it, that he could imagine, that he had &s;aid any thing to the pur|po&s;e, by <HI>barely</HI> putting the&s;e que&s;tions! They are really nothing more than &s;o many &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed affirmations: and will he call this argu|ing? He propo&s;ed, that every objection &s;hould be fairly debated before the tribunal of the Public; but, in&s;tead of debating upon this, he roundly and repeatedly affirms, by way of que|ry, that it has no validity in it. His proper work was, to make it clearly evident, by good rea&s;oning, that the propo&s;ed plan did not imply an e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that it could, without one, be carried into effect; the contrary to which will, without all doubt, be found the truth of fact, if ever this plan takes place. If it &s;hould, it mu&s;t be by the con&s;titution of a new church of England in the Colonies; but how this can be effected without an e&s;tabli&s;hment, accord|ing

to the true idea of this word, no one, unle&s;s it be the Doctor, can explain. This is what he ought to have done in an&s;wer to the pre&s;ent objection; and until we are thus favoured, we &s;hall take the liberty to think, we are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, while we are not di&s;|po&s;ed to encourage the planned epi&s;copal e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, as we de&s;ire no e&s;tabli&s;hment of our own mode of religious government, or di&s;ci|pline.</P>
<P>THE Doctor now gives us a curious &s;pecimen of his talent at nice, &s;trict, clo&s;e rea&s;oning. I had &s;aid, 'It does not appear to us, that CHRIST has entru&s;ted the &s;tate with a right to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments. If the &s;tate in England has this delegated authority, mu&s;t it not be owned, that the &s;tate in China, in Turkey, in Spain, mu&s;t have this authority al&s;o? What &s;hould make the difference in the eye of true rea&s;on? Hath the &s;tate in England been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by Heaven by any peculiar grant, be|yond the &s;tate in other Countries? If it has, let the grant be produced. If it has not, all &s;tates have, in common, the &s;ame authority. And as they mu&s;t &s;everally be &s;uppo&s;ed to exert this authority in e&s;tabli&s;hments conformable to their own &s;entiments in religion; what can the con&s;equence be, but infinite damage to the cau&s;e of GOD, and true religion? And &s;uch in fact has been the con&s;equence of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, in all ages, and in all places'. Some of the&s;e bad con&s;equences were then particularly mentioned. Let us now &s;ee the Doctor's rea&s;on|ing to invalidate what was thus offered again&s;t the <HI>right</HI> of &s;tates to make religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. Says he, 'The &s;ame argument with which the Doctor endeavours to overthrow it
<PB N="144" REF="011598_0073_0F877A84DDC640E0">
[this right of &s;tates] is as forcible again&s;t the <HI>right of private judgment.</HI> This will evidently appear from the following experiment. If a per&s;on in England has this right, mu&s;t it not be owned that a per&s;on in China, in Turkey, in Spain, mu&s;t have it al&s;o', and &s;o on, applying what I had offered again&s;t the <HI>right of &s;tates</HI> to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, to the <HI>right of private judgment</HI>; as though the argument was equally forcible again&s;t the latter as the former. But &s;urely the Doctor does not believe, that the <HI>right of &s;tates</HI> to make religious e&s;tabli&s;hments is as clearly and indubitably a grant from GOD, as the <HI>right of private judgment</HI>! And if he does not, what doth his arguing prove? The ca&s;es mu&s;t be parallel, or the rea&s;oning from the one to the other cannot be conclu&s;ive. It is allowed, the bad effects that follow from the exerci&s;e of <HI>private judgment</HI> are no proof, that men have not univer&s;ally a right to judge for them&s;elves. And why? Becau&s;e they have this <HI>right</HI> granted to them by GOD him&s;elf, and we are as &s;ure of it as that he has granted them any other right whatever. Is the ca&s;e the &s;ame with re&s;pect to the <HI>right of &s;tates</HI> to make religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments? Is not their pretended <HI>right</HI> founded en|tirely on its &s;uppo&s;ed connection with the real intere&s;t of religion? It is therefore a good argu|ment again&s;t this <HI>right,</HI> though none at all again&s;t the <HI>right of private judgment,</HI> that, in&s;tead of being advantageous, it has been infinitely hurt|ful to the cau&s;e of GOD, and true virtue. The religion of Je&s;us, in particular, has &s;uffered more from the exerci&s;e of this pretended right, than from all other cau&s;es put together; and it is, with me, pa&s;t all doubt, that it will never be re&s;tored to its primitive purity, &s;implicity,
<PB N="145" REF="011598_0073_0F877A84DDC640E0">
and glory, until religious e&s;tabli&s;hments are &s;o brought down as to be no more. In &s;hort, when the Doctor &s;hall make it evident, that the <HI>&s;tate-right</HI> we are con&s;idering &s;tands upon the &s;ame bottom, and is as inconte&s;tably a grant from GOD, as the <HI>right of private judgment,</HI> we &s;hall then allow, that the bad con&s;equences flow|ing from the exerci&s;e of the&s;e rights are as for|cible an argument again&s;t the one as the other, that is, no argument at all; but, until then we &s;hall think this arguing altogether below one, who would be e&s;teemed a gentleman endowed with a good capacity for rea&s;oning. I am obli|ged to &s;ay, the Doctor &s;eems to have no great ta|lent at an&s;wering objections, or has been unac|countably carele&s;s in the doing of it. In&s;tead of recommending to the reader what has been wrote again&s;t <HI>religious e&s;tabli&s;hments,</HI> I would ad|vi&s;e him to con&s;ult his own rea&s;on, and to pay a regard to the dictates of COMMON SENSE, and he need not then fear being led a&s;ide either by 'Bi&s;hop <HI>Warburton</HI>'s alliance between the church and the &s;tate, or Dr. <HI>Stebbing</HI>'s e&s;&s;ay concerning civil government, or Dr. <HI>Roger</HI>'s vindication of the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, or Bi&s;hop <HI>Ellys</HI> on &s;pi|ritual liberty, or a late elegant e&s;&s;ay on e&s;ta|bli&s;hments in religion, in an&s;wer to the confe&s;|&s;ional.'</P>
<P>OBJECTION V. 'The church of England in the Colonies, in its comparative low &s;tate, in|&s;tead of an Epi&s;copate, upon this plan, or any other, needs rather the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of its friends to &s;upport its pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, and others that are &s;till wanted.' The reply be|gins, 'The Doctor forgets that the church of England, in &s;everal of the Colonies, is not in that comparative low &s;tate he &s;peaks of; but is
<PB N="146" REF="011598_0074_0F877A85AB72CD80">
able to &s;upport, and does &s;upport, its Mini&s;ters in general as amply as any &s;et of Clergymen are &s;upported in the Briti&s;h dominions.' This I did not forget, though I took no notice of it, for this very good rea&s;on, becau&s;e it did not appear, that the church of England in any of the&s;e Colonies had complained for want of Bi&s;hops, or were di&s;po&s;ed to petition for them. The only com|plainers and petitioners are re&s;idents in the other Colonies, where the church of England is in the comparatively low &s;tate that was repre&s;ented. Neither Clergy, nor Laity in the Colonies where epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters are &s;o 'amply &s;up|ported,' have made any &s;tir, that we know of, about the want of Bi&s;hops, or &s;ignified their de|&s;ire of their mi&s;&s;ion. But, &s;ays the Doctor, 'Suppo&s;ing the church throughout the Colonies needed the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of its friends to &s;upport its Mini&s;ters, yet this would be no proof that it does not need al&s;o an Epi&s;copate.' If it would be no proof of this, it would fully prove, that the epi&s;copal Clergy, in the Colonies, are boundle&s;s in their de&s;ires of charity. One would think, the amazing &s;um that is annually, and charitably, expended in &s;upporting Mi&s;&s;ionaries, might &s;atisfy the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lurdie&s;t beggars, without han|kering after as much more charity as would be &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of Bi&s;hops.

as many Mi&s;&s;ionaries as would be needful there, would be &s;wallowed up by one Bi&s;hop only. And would this tend &s;o much to the honour of GOD, and the good of &s;ouls, as if it was ex|pended in &s;upport of mi&s;&s;ions that are really ne|ce&s;&s;ary?' Upon this the Doctor cries out, 'It is &s;urprizing to &s;ee what advantages are claimed by &s;ome people! How they can make u&s;e of the &s;ame argument to different purpo&s;es! When other ends are to be an&s;wered, the writers again&s;t the church can tell us, that the Society have no power to apply their funds to other u&s;es than were intended by the donors&mdash;But now an Epi&s;copate is in view, it is thought rea&s;ona|ble and ju&s;t that the Society &s;hould alienate a fund, more &s;trictly appropriated to a particular u&s;e than any other in their power, (for this may be truly &s;aid of the fund for the &s;upport of Ame|rican Bi&s;hops) and expend it upon Mi&s;&s;ionaries to be &s;ent to Carolina, and other places, provi|ded always, that &s;uch places are at a due di&s;|tance from New-England.' It is not ea&s;y to conceive, what could give occa&s;ion for this &s;trange remark. Not a word was &s;aid of the fund appropriated for the &s;upport of American Bi&s;hops, or of the Society's expending one far|thing of this fund to other u&s;es than were intend|ed by the donors. It was only &s;aid in gene|ral, 'That charity which might be &s;ufficient for the maintenance of as many Mi&s;&s;ionaries as were wanted would be &s;wallowed up by one Bi|&s;hop only.'

in the Doctor's opinion, make up this deficien|cy, &s;hould Bi&s;hops be &s;ent? This, and this on|ly, is what I had in view. And as Mi&s;&s;iona|ries were peculiarly wanted in Carolina, and other places, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, and I believe, up|on ju&s;t grounds, that it would be more for the honour of GOD, it &s;hould be expended this way, than in &s;upporting Bi&s;hops. What the Doctor has here &s;aid is therefore quite aliene from what was really intended, nor in the lea&s;t an an&s;wer to it. Had he looked within, I can &s;carce think his con&s;cience would have &s;uffered him to in&s;inuate, that I &s;pake of mi&s;&s;ions to Ca|rolina, becau&s;e at 'a due di&s;tance from New-England.' He knows, that the expre&s;sly nam|ed object of the Society's care is, the mi&s;&s;ion of Clergymen for the admini&s;tration of the word and &s;acraments in tho&s;e Colonies, where there was no provi&s;ion at all, or a mean one, for the publick wor&s;hip of GOD. And he mu&s;t know likewi&s;e, unle&s;s he is &s;trangely ignorant, that Carolina is the Colony, if there is any one on the American Continent, where, as we have of|ten been told in the &s;ociety-&s;ermons, they had &s;carcely any form of public wor&s;hip; where even the LORD's day was hardly di&s;tingui&s;hed from other days, but by greater idlene&s;s and profane|ne&s;s; and where bapti&s;m and the LORD's &s;up|per were &s;carcely known to be admini&s;tred. Why then would he &s;ugge&s;t, that I mentioned Carolina, becau&s;e 'duly di&s;tant from New-En|gland?' He has not herei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;covered that chri&s;tian concern for the propagation of the go&s;|pel, according to the acknowledged de&s;ign of the Society's charter, which might have been expected from a Mi&s;&s;ionary in virtue of it. He adds, 'As the Society have never acted the part

of unfaithful &s;tewards, in other ca&s;es, we can be under no apprehen&s;ions that they will in this.' I &s;ay not, that they have acted an unfaithful part; but this I will &s;ay, it is the real truth of fact, to whatever cau&s;e it may be owing, that they have employed few Mi&s;&s;ionaries, next to none, in Carolina, where they were mo&s;t needed, and multiplied them where there was little, if any need at all of them; and in &s;ome places they have &s;upported, and are &s;till &s;upporting them, where the churches to whom they mini&s;ter are abundantly able, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, to &s;upport the go&s;pel. And though guarding the Coloni&s;ts again&s;t, or delivering them from, the delu&s;ions and &s;uper&s;titions of POPERY, is one e&s;&s;ential part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Society, as pointed out in their charter, they have &s;o &s;trangely neglected Canada, which, ever &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, has been a Province in &s;ubjection to the Briti&s;h Crown, as to give occa&s;ion for a letter to them, from the Chaplain to the garri&s;on at Montreal, wherein he &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab&s;tract of the proceedings of the Society, annex|ed to the &s;ociety-&s;ermon preached Feb. 17, 1769, by the Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> 'That the Romi&s;h Prie&s;ts avail them&s;elves greatly of the neglected &s;tate of the church of England in tho&s;e parts; per&s;uading the Canadians, that we have not religion &s;o much at heart as they.' Let the impartial Public judge, whether it would not be a much &s;tronger argument of the Society's faithfulne&s;s as &s;tewards, to take effectual care that Carolina and Canada have a full &s;upply of Mi&s;&s;ionaries, rather than New-England, New-York, the Jer|&s;ies, or Penn&s;ylvania, where there is no pretence

of any want of them, but meerly to uphold a different mode of admini&s;tration in one and the &s;ame religion.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid, 'As to the Colonies, extending from Penn&s;ylvania to the northermo&s;t bounds of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province, notwith&s;tanding the pious care of the Society at home, and the va&s;t charity they have been annually expending in favour of the church of England, from their fir&s;t incorporation to this day, it has grown but little in compari&s;on with the other denominati|ons of chri&s;tians, not having got as yet beyond its infant &s;tate.' Says the Doctor in reply, 'I conceive he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken as to the fact. In Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey, and New-York, I will not be po&s;itive that the church has encrea&s;ed beyond the proportion of other denominations for fifty years pa&s;t&mdash;But in the New-England Colonies it appears, from good accounts, that the church has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed; and that the number of its profe&s;&s;ors at this day bears a greater proportion to the number of inhabi|tants, than it ever has done before. I may be mi&s;taken with regard to &s;ome of the New-En|gland Colonies: But'&mdash;. He has hitherto &s;poken cautiou&s;ly, but not like one who appears to have a &s;ufficient acquaintance with the real truth of fact. Upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination, it would be found, that the increa&s;e of other denomina|tions, beyond the increa&s;e of Epi&s;copalians, is greater in New-England, than in New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, or Penn&s;ylvania; and this greater increa&s;e is rapidly going on in all the Colonies that con&s;titute what is called New-England, ex|cepting the Colony of Connecticut, in which there has been the greate&s;t increa&s;e of the church of England; but there is nothing 'amaz|ing,'
<PB N="151" REF="011598_0076_0F877A872AB6D080">
as the Doctor's epithet is, in this increa&s;e: Nor had he the lea&s;t rea&s;on to go on &s;aying, 'I cannot at pre&s;ent recollect an example, in any age or country, wherein &s;o great a proportion of pro&s;elites has been made to any religion in &s;o &s;hort a time, as has been made to the church of England in the we&s;tern divi&s;ion of that populous Colony; unle&s;s where the power of miracles, or the arm of the Magi&s;trate, was exerted to pro|duce that effect.' Notwith&s;tanding the hyper|bolical mode in which the Doctor here flouri&s;hes, there are not one tenth part &s;o many Epi&s;co|palians, even in the we&s;tern divi&s;ion of Con|necticut, as there have been &s;terling pounds ex|pended in order to pro&s;elite them: Nor are there more epi&s;copal churches in all the New-England Colonies, than there have been thou|&s;ands of pounds &s;terling &s;pent to found and &s;up|port them. And they are, by far the greater part of them, not excepting tho&s;e in the above|mentioned 'we&s;tern divi&s;ion,' in &s;o weak and low a &s;tate, that there would be no hope of their continued exi&s;tence, if that charity was withdrawn, which, at fir&s;t, gave being to them, and has all along &s;upported them in being: Whereas, the churches of other denominations, without the help of charity from abroad, or the expectation or de&s;ire of any, are become numerous, and continually increa&s;e in number, beyond what has been known in any age, or place, &s;ince the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;poken of the church of England here, 'as being in its infancy, not able to &s;tand upon its own legs, and &s;o far from a &s;tate of matu|rity, as not to make it worth while for a Bi&s;hop to come here.' The Doctor replies, 'infant and feeble as &s;he is, he has allowed that &s;he may

be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">70,000 &s;trong in the Colonies&mdash;Now can he po&s;&s;ibly think, when he allows him&s;elf time for con&s;ideration, that the church of England in America, containing 270,000 members, in which are included mo&s;t of the governors and princi|pal per&s;ons in the Colonies, is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is not worth while for a Bi&s;hop to take the charge of it?' When I &s;uppo&s;ed the church of England might contain 270,000, I took into the computation all the Epi&s;copalians on the Ameri|can Continent. But when I &s;pake of her as in 'an infant feeble &s;tate, not able to &s;tand upon her own legs,' my view was (as may be &s;een in the pa&s;&s;ages with which the&s;e words are connect|ed) to her exi&s;tence in the &s;even Colonies, ex|tending from Penn&s;ylvania to the utmo&s;t north-ea&s;t bounderies of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province; in all which, though they contain by far the greate&s;t number of inhabitants on this Conti|nent, there are not more than 26 or 27 thou&s;and profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England, who are &s;cattered over an extent of 600 miles in length, and more than an 100 in breadth. And 'of the&s;e, (as was ob&s;erved in my an&s;wer, pag. 156, to which the Doctor has made no reply) it would be no wrong to the truth, if it &s;hould be &s;aid, a very con&s;iderable part went over to the church, not &s;o much upon &s;ober inquiry and real princi|ple, as from di&s;gu&s;t at the pari&s;h-mini&s;ter, or unhappy prejudices ari&s;ing from the placing a meeting-hou&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch important difficul|ty in the towns where they lived.' In this view of the church of England, which is certainly a ju&s;t one, what occa&s;ion is there for Bi&s;hops, at lea&s;t in the&s;e parts of America? I had nothing to do with the Colonies to the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylvania. They have neither complained for
<PB N="153" REF="011598_0077_0F877A87D96B4748">
want of Bi&s;hops, or de&s;ired the mi&s;&s;ion of them. When this is the ca&s;e, we &s;hall doubtle&s;s &s;ay that upon the matter, which is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. The above de&s;cribed &s;even Colonies only, contain the complainers and petitioners; and as the So|ciety's chief &s;olicitude, as well as charity, has been laid out to epi&s;copi&s;e the&s;e Colonies, they are eminently,if not &s;olely, the Colonies for which Bi&s;hops have been &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ought after. But the church of England mu&s;t make a more re|&s;pectable figure in the&s;e Colonies, before &s;he may hope for &s;uch a &s;uperior order of men as Bi&s;hops. Will it become their dignity to be &s;upported by charity, and to be placed at the head of churches &s;o dependant on charity, as that if it is withheld, they mu&s;t, by far the grea|ter part of them, fall into non-exi&s;tence? The church (as the Doctor loves to call it&mdash;as though there was no other church) mu&s;t wait until it arrives at a &s;tate of much greater maturity, be|fore it will be worth while for Bi&s;hops to come here. It is acknowledged the Governor, in mo&s;t of the&s;e Colonies, is commonly in name, an Epi&s;|copalian; though &s;ometimes de&s;titute of every thing el&s;e that looks like religion.&mdash;Surely &s;uch Governors cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have much at heart the affair of an Epi&s;copate, unle&s;s they &s;hould view it as connected with their worldly intere&s;t in one &s;hape or another. It is quite re|mote from the truth to &s;ay, that 'mo&s;t of the principal per&s;ons in the Colonies' are of this per&s;ua&s;ion, unle&s;s by principal per&s;ons are meant, tho&s;e who are appointed to their civil po&s;ts from home. In general there are 50 prin|cipal per&s;ons to one, in the Non-epi&s;copal Colonies, who are not members of the church of England, but of churches of other denomi|nations.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="011598_0078_0F877A895CF4C010">THE Doctor now leaves me for a while, in or|der to con&s;ider the objections I had introduced as offered by Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> again&s;t this plan, in reply to a &s;uppo&s;ed high dignitary of the church of England. As it was the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the 'appeal' to remove objections again&s;t the American Epi&s;copate, 'the &s;uffering the&s;e ob|jections to lie again&s;t it, without li&s;ping a word to take off the force of them, 'was mentioned as a failure. The Doctor has excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying, 'He had not &s;een the&s;e objections, though he had in vain made inquiry after them.' The excu&s;e is 'candidly accepted' as a good one. 'But (&s;ays he) what excu&s;e can Doctor <HI>Chauncy</HI> make for taking no notice of what was powerfully offered by Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> in an&s;wer to the&s;e very objections of Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>?' There is no need of making any excu&s;e, as, in compli|ance with the invitation given in the 'appeal,' my bu&s;ine&s;s was, not to an&s;wer objections, but to bring them that they might be an&s;wered by the Doctor. Now he has adopted what he ima|gines was 'powerfully offered by Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI>' it is become proper I &s;hould take notice of it; but, had I done this before, I might have been taxed with officiou&s;ne&s;s; I &s;hould certainly have acted out of character as an objector, and pre|vented my&s;elf in that which ought not to have been expected until now.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Doctor brings in Mr. <HI>Apthorp,</HI> he &s;ays a few words, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, he intended &s;hould be looked upon as an an&s;wer to the 'ex|pedient I &s;ugge&s;ted to compromi&s;e matters be|tween Epi&s;copalians and other denominations in the Colonies;' but as he has &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed over what I had largely offered in illu&s;tration of the propriety and rea&s;onablene&s;s of this expedient, I

have nothing to do here but to de&s;ire the reader to turn to p. 150, 169, 160 of the an&s;wer to the 'appeal;' and he mu&s;t then be convinced, that the Doctor, under the pretence of &s;aying &s;omething, has really &s;aid nothing.</P>
<P>NOW comes in Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>'s an&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s objections. This an&s;wer was publi&s;h|ed before the Doctor's death, and the only rea|&s;on he made no reply to it was, that neither he, or his friends, thought it worthy of &s;uch notice. It was, as they imagined, wrote principally with a view to recommend him&s;elf to a certain great man, who&s;e favour might be advantagious to him. However, if he had been permitted, in the alwi&s;e government of Heaven, to have lived until this time, he would, doubtle&s;s, upon this occa&s;ion, have pointed out the utter in&s;ufficien|cy of this Gentleman's an&s;wer to his objections. And though he might have done it to better pur|po&s;e than I can, divine Providence has put a fa|tal bar in the way of the Public's having this &s;a|tisfaction. The reader, while he remembers it is the Doctor's friend that appears in his behalf, will not attribute to him any defect he may di&s;|cern in the vindication of his objections.</P>
<P>'THE Doctor, (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI>) affects to doubt whether the &s;cheme propo&s;ed by his an|&s;werer be not meerly his own, in&s;tead of being, as is a&s;&s;erted, the real and only one that has been in view; and &s;ays, that if this a&s;&s;ertion be true, he and others have been mi&s;informed.' The reply is, 'Let his or their informers &s;ay on what grounds they have ever affirmed a different one to have been framed; or el&s;e let them take &s;hame to them&s;elves for inventing fal&s;hoods, or venting imaginations for facts; and let the Doctor &s;et a mark on them, and be more cauti|ous

whom he believes hereafter.' What was &s;aid by the Doctor is here &s;et in a very partial and unfair light. In&s;tead of properly quoting his words, as he u&s;ed them in a connected cour&s;e of rea&s;oning, this writer has given them, or ra|ther the &s;en&s;e in which he under&s;tood them, in a di&s;joined ab&s;olute form. The writer the Doctor replies to, after he had propo&s;ed a &s;cheme for a Colony-Epi&s;copate, a&s;&s;ures us, 'This is the real and only &s;cheme that hath been planned for Bi|&s;hops in America; and whoever hath heard of any other hath been mi&s;informed through mi&s;|take or de&s;ign.' Says the Doctor in an&s;wer, 'To &s;peak for my&s;elf, then, I am one of tho&s;e who have been thus <HI>mi&s;informed</HI>; and I know of others who have been &s;o, in common with me &mdash;He &s;peaks of this &s;cheme with great a&s;|&s;urance, as if he were at <HI>head-quarters,</HI> and cer|tainly knew it to be the <HI>real</HI> and <HI>only</HI> one. Po&s;|&s;ibly, this may be the ca&s;e. But he is not known; nor has he informed us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on what ground or authority he goes in giving this ac|count of the matter. The declaration of an anonymous writer, how confidently &s;oever he may expre&s;s him&s;elf, is not, &s;urely, &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us, that this is the true &s;cheme planned.&mdash; It may po&s;&s;ibly be only his own &s;cheme, the &s;cheme of a private man; and until it comes with better authority, or in a more authentic way, we may con&s;ider it as an imaginary one.'&mdash; Let Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> 'take &s;hame to him&s;elf' for pretending to an&s;wer an objection, without &s;o much as &s;aying a word to invalidate &s;uch perti|nent and &s;olid rea&s;oning in &s;upport of it. I can|not &s;uppo&s;e Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> him&s;elf will think, that what is here &s;aid is 'powerfully offered;' if he &s;hould, without all doubt, the impartial Public will judge otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="011598_0079_0F877A8A1AF10C88">HE goes on to tell us of '&s;ucce&s;&s;ive propo&s;als for American Bi&s;hops, made at different times, through a long cour&s;e of years, by men of high rank and character in the church; all which agree with what the an&s;werer has avered.' He likewi&s;e gives us at large 'Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler</HI>'s &s;cheme, as one 'that might have peculiar weight with the Doctor;' and &s;peaks of it as exactly &s;i|milar to that in the an&s;wer to his ob&s;ervations.' What is all this to the purpo&s;e? We know, and the Doctor knew, there has long been a de&s;ign to introduce Bi&s;hops into the Colonies, and that plans have been formed to accompli&s;h this de&s;ign. But &s;hould there have been a general agreement in the&s;e plans, they may be nothing more than the &s;chemes of <HI>private men</HI>; and this indeed is the truth of fact. They are not to be looked on as &s;chemes &s;et forth upon the foot of <HI>proper autho|rity.</HI> The planners of them had no &s;uch au|thority; and whatever they might intend, or pretend, if ever an Epi&s;copate is authoritatively &s;ettled in America, it may be, for aught any or all of them can &s;ay, upon a plan very different from that which they have propo&s;ed. Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp</HI> is plea&s;ed to &s;ay of the propo&s;ed plan, 'That it is &s;uch a &s;imple and beautiful plan of the mo&s;t antient and moderate Epi&s;copacy, that it &s;hould, not only remove all the Doctor's ap|prehen&s;ions, but the &s;cruples of every rational and learned Di&s;&s;enter again&s;t that apo&s;tolic form of government.' Where does this writer find, in any of apo&s;tolic epi&s;tles, the model of an epi&s;|copate without any authority to govern the La|ity? Let him, if he can, produce a text, in any part of the new-te&s;tament, wherein <HI>ruling the Clergy, in di&s;tinction from the Laity,</HI> is made the proper work of Bi&s;hops. He would likewi&s;e do
<PB N="158" REF="011598_0080_0F877A8AEACEADE0">
what was never done before, if he would point out that part of the chri&s;tian word, where the Bi&s;hop's dioce&s;s, in the 'mo&s;t ancient times,' ex|tended an hundred miles in breadth, and &s;everal hundred in length. Until he it able to prove, that &s;uch was 'the mo&s;t antient Epi&s;copacy,' no rational or learned Di&s;&s;enter again&s;t the propo&s;ed plan, will entertain an opinion of it as, in any mea&s;ure, agreeing with the 'apo&s;tolic form of government.' This Gentleman has not di&s;co|vered here the mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, with either the apo&s;tolic Epi&s;copacy, or that which took place in the mo&s;t antient times.</P>
<P>HE goes on, 'Suppo&s;ing this to be the real &s;cheme, the Doctor owns that it &s;ets the matter in a le&s;s exceptionable point of view, than he had &s;een it in before.' Very true; and I am ready to own the &s;ame thing. But this does not make the &s;cheme unexceptionable. He now com|plains, 'The Doctor cannot forbear going fif|ty years back to ridicule &s;ome harmle&s;s, though ill cho&s;en, phra&s;es, in which the &s;ub&s;tance of it [the &s;cheme] is expre&s;&s;ed.' As he had occa&s;ion to &s;peak of the Society's ab&s;tract, printed in 1715, in which, among other rea&s;ons for an Epi&s;copate in the Colonies, 'the ble&s;&s;ing all manner of people &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch holy im|pre&s;&s;ions as are made by the impo&s;ition of the Bi&s;hops hands,' is particularly mentioned; it will, I believe, be thought excu&s;able in him, if he has called this a matter '&s;ublime, my&s;terious and &s;acred,' pa&s;&s;ing it over with nothing more than a contemptuous &s;neer. But, &s;ays this wri|ter, 'He well knows, or ea&s;ily may, that we a&s;cribe no more efficacy to the laying on of Bi|&s;hops hands, then his brethren do to the laying on of Pre&s;byter's hands.' The Doctor could not
<PB N="159" REF="011598_0080_0F877A8AEACEADE0">
po&s;&s;ibly know this, becau&s;e it is not the truth of fact. Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> mu&s;t be very ignorant of the &s;entiments of Non-epi&s;copalians, if he does not know, that we conceive quite differently of the laying on of Pre&s;byters hands, from what many, at lea&s;t, of the church of England do of the laying on of Bi&s;hops hands. Do Epi&s;copa|lians never &s;peak of an <HI>indelible character</HI> as im|pre&s;&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop's hand in ordination? Do they never lead people to think, as if there was an in&s;tituted connection between the impo|&s;ition of his hand in confirmation, and the be|&s;towment of the Spirit in his gracious influences? The&s;e are the fal&s;e and ridiculous notions they deride, not ordination or confirmation, meerly as &s;uch, by the laying on of Bi&s;hops hands. And, perhaps, ridicule is the fitte&s;t way in which &s;uch my&s;teriou&s;ly &s;acred matters can be treated. Nei|ther Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> or any of his brethren, object to the performance of the offices of ordination or confirmation by per&s;ons of that order, to which Epi&s;copalians conceive they are committed.' But, &s;ays this writer, 'The Doctor thinks we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficiently of the whole ex|erci&s;e of our religion, becau&s;e our young peo|ple may be confirmed, and Clergymen ordained for us, and properly in&s;pected afterwards; pro|vided they will all go from America to Europe for the&s;e purpo&s;es. Can he &s;ay with a good con&s;cience, that liberty like this is all he &s;hould de&s;ire for him&s;elf, and his brethren?' And here he is intreated 'to read over &s;ome words of his an&s;werer, to which he has made no reply'. The words are the&s;e; 'The American Di&s;&s;enters from our communion, would think it in&s;uppor|tably grievous to have no mini&s;ters, but &s;uch as received ordination in England or Ireland; or
<PB N="160" REF="011598_0081_0F877A8C225B3250">
to be witheld from the u&s;e of any religious rite, which they e&s;teemed as highly as we do confir|mation; or to have their church de&s;titute of a &s;uper-intendency, which they conceived to be of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution. I &s;hould in &s;uch a ca&s;e be a zealous advocate for them, as not yet en|joying the full toleration to which they had a right. And &s;urely they ought to a&s;k their con|&s;ciences very &s;eriou&s;ly, why they oppo&s;e our ap|plication for &s;uch indulgence, as they would claim for them&s;elves; and whether indeed &s;uch oppo&s;ition is not downright per&s;ecution; and that in a matter meerly &s;piritual, without the mixture of any temporal concern'. The rea|&s;on why the Doctor made no reply to the&s;e words was, not becau&s;e 'they admit of none,' but be|cau&s;e they are quite be&s;ide the ca&s;e in di&s;pute. The American Non-epi&s;copalians neither enjoy or de&s;ire to enjoy, any other liberty than to provide &s;uch Pa&s;tors, to officiate in &s;uch &s;ervices among them, as they think are agreable to the word of GOD. Such liberty is equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Epi&s;copalians. If the other denominations more fully and conveniently enjoy the exerci&s;e of their religion, it is not in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure owing to their being favoured with greater li|berty, but to their greater care of them&s;elves under <HI>that permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> which is <HI>equally granted</HI> to all denominations. If there is any one <HI>purely &s;piritual</HI> privilege, which Epi&s;copalians do not as fully enjoy as any of the other denominations, it is owing to them&s;elves, and not to any want of liberty in this re&s;pect. Their liberty is pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame with the liberty of the other per|&s;ua&s;ions. Was it not, I &s;hould be as 'zealous an advocate for them,' as this Gentleman could be for us under like circum&s;tances; as thinking
<PB N="161" REF="011598_0081_0F877A8C225B3250">
that they were hardly u&s;ed. The true rea&s;on why Epi&s;copalians do not AS FULLY enjoy the exerci&s;e of their religion, as the other denomina|tions is, not becau&s;e they are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of equal liberty, but becau&s;e they do not make the like full u&s;e of it. The&s;e other denominations would continue until dooms-day without Pa&s;tors to officiate in any religious &s;ervice among them, if they waited for their mi&s;&s;ion from the <HI>&s;tate</HI> at home: Nor would they complain of this as a burden, much le&s;s an in&s;upportable one. They are intirely &s;atisfied, as they have the grant of liberty to provide for them&s;elves the full enjoy|ment of all the &s;piritual privileges of the King|dom of CHRIST. Epi&s;copalians are equally partakers in the &s;ame granted liberty; and they &s;hould be contented herewith, and not complain of it as an in&s;uperable hard&s;hip, that the <HI>&s;tate at home</HI> does not furni&s;h them with Bi&s;hops in order to the compleat exerci&s;e of their religion. Did chri&s;tian churches in the fir&s;t ages of the go&s;pel, make &s;uch complaints? If they might be permitted to provide &s;piritual officers for the &s;piritual &s;ervices of chri&s;tianity, it was all they de&s;ired; and it is all that can rea&s;onably be de|&s;ired at this day. And &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion is as compleatly enjoyed by Epi&s;copalians, as by any of the other denominations on the Continent.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> proceeds, 'The Doctor, &s;till flying to ridicule in defect of argument, inti|mates, how much the Epi&s;copalians in America need to be <HI>well ruled</HI> and <HI>governed</HI>&mdash;how much the Clergy need to be <HI>united,</HI> and reduced to <HI>or|der</HI>'. The Doctor did not undertake to argue upon the&s;e things, as is here &s;ugge&s;ted. He purpo&s;ely avoided it, le&s;t he &s;hould not 'expre&s;s him&s;elf with quite &s;o much gravity and &s;olemni|ty'
<PB N="162" REF="011598_0082_0F877A8C8052AC10">
as &s;ome might think proper. It is not there|fore ea&s;y to account for this remark upon what the Doctor mentioned in tran&s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only, unle&s;s it was that occa&s;ion might be here from taken to tell us, 'that the American Clergy are unanimous in their wi&s;hes to be under the immediate in&s;pection of Bi&s;hops re&s;ident among them; which con|currence implies quite the contrary to a pre&s;ent di&s;orderly &s;tate of that Clergy'. That tho&s;e among the Clergy, who petitioned for Bi&s;hops are 'unanimous" at lea&s;t in pretence, in their wi&s;hes to have them, is not di&s;puted; but that the whole American Clergy are thus unanimous is far from being a 'known' fact. No evidence has yet been given, that the Clergy, any more than the Laity, in tho&s;e Colonies which are cal|led Epi&s;copal, are at all de&s;irous of being under the 'immediate in&s;pection of Bi&s;hops'; nor is it thought to be a fact capable of being evidenced. How far this may imply 'a pre&s;ent di&s;orderly &s;tate of that Clergy', I leave with this writer to &s;ay. He adds, with reference to the American epi&s;copal Clergy in common, 'they are, perhaps, as faithful to their tru&s;t, and as blamele&s;s in their manners, as any body of men in the chri&s;tian mini&s;try'. It would give me real and great plea|&s;ure, was I as fully &s;atisfied of this, as this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iter &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>HE now brings in the Doctor &s;aying, 'great inconveniences are likely to follow from the &s;en|ding Bi&s;hops to America'; and then an&s;wers, 'He &s;ays al&s;o, it is readily owned that our appre|hen&s;ion of what may po&s;&s;ibly or probably be the con&s;equences of it, ought not to put us on in|fringing the religious liberty of our fellow-&s;ub|jects and chri&s;tian brethren. Nay, he adds, nei|ther have we any power to do &s;o, if we were
<PB N="163" REF="011598_0082_0F877A8C8052AC10">
<HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>wicked enough to de&s;ire it</HI>; our charter granting &s;uch liberty to <HI>all prote&s;tants</HI>'. What now is the con&s;equence of the&s;e conce&s;&s;i|ons? 'Therefore, &s;ays this writer, Bi&s;hops may, by that charter, &s;ettle even in New-England'. So purely &s;piritual Bi&s;hops might without it, or in any part of the chri&s;tian world, in virtue of that liberty wherewith CHRIST has made the profe&s;&s;ors of his religion free. It follows, 'And if the having Bi&s;hops among them be part of the religious liberty of the Epi&s;copalians, as it evi|dently is; the Di&s;&s;enters ought not to oppo&s;e it on account of apprehended con&s;equenes'. There is a great and wide difference (as has been abun|dantly proved) between purely &s;piritual Bi&s;hops, and &s;uch Bi&s;hops as are &s;pecified in the propo&s;ed plan. We make no oppo&s;ition to Bi&s;hops that have 'authority altogether from CHRIST, and not the &s;tate'. If we oppo&s;e Bi&s;hops of a contra|ry &s;pecies, we oppo&s;e no part of that epi&s;copal liberty which is RELIGIOUS; and &s;hould great inconveniences be likely to follow from the &s;en|ding &s;uch Bi&s;hops, oppo&s;ition to their mi&s;&s;ion would, on this account, be highly rea&s;onable, and not the lea&s;t infringement on RELIGIOUS liberty.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays this writer, 'What are the bad con&s;equences apprehended?' He an&s;wers, 'Bi|&s;hops, the Doctor tells us, are ambitious and unquiet'. In reply whereto he &s;ays, 'So are Pre&s;byters, and all &s;orts of men too often.' But this proves nothing, unle&s;s he could have &s;aid further, that their &s;phere of influence was equally exten&s;ive, in con&s;equence of which there was equal danger, from their intrieguing with great men at home, or with Governors and principal men here, of carrying into execution &s;uch &s;chemes as might be greatly hurtful, both in a civil and
<PB N="164" REF="011598_0083_0F877A8E0A4E5610">
religious &s;en&s;e. It follows, 'The Doctor will own that Bi&s;hops are now, and long have been as quiet an order of men as any in the nation.' He will be far from owning this, 'if it be true, as many affirm [the&s;e are the Doctor's words, p. 64] that <HI>high church tory-principles</HI> are lately <HI>re|vived</HI> in England, and greatly favoured by &s;ome, who&s;e influence may go far towards bringing them into as much reputation, as they have been in di&s;grace &s;ince the death of Queen <HI>Ann.</HI>'</P>
<P>THE Doctor had &s;aid, 'Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that Bi&s;hops are to be <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> &s;ent to America with &s;uch limited powers [as are mentioned in the propo&s;ed plan,] to re&s;ide in the epi&s;copal Colo|nies, and to have no concern, but with Epi&s;co|palians. Have we &s;ufficient ground to think, that they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would, to the day of doom, or for a long time, remain contented with &s;uch powers, or under &s;uch limitations? In a word, that they would continue &s;uch inoffen&s;ive harmle&s;s creatures as this Gentleman &s;uppo|&s;es.'&mdash;To this the reply is, 'Who knows whe|ther the New-Englandlers will not hang Qua|kers and Witches again?' It is conceded, no one knows that they will not, &s;hould the propo&s;ed mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops take place; for, in England, where there is no complaint for want of Bi&s;hops, both Quakers and Witches have been hanged in much greater numbers than they ever were here. This writer goes on 'The Clergy of En|gland are in general friends to religious free|dom: The people of England, Whigs and To|ries, are unfavourable to clerical power; and a far greater danger, than the Doctor's imagi|nary one, is that of their laying a&s;ide all regard to the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and to chri&s;tianity it|&s;elf.' The Doctor him&s;elf, in an&s;wering a like reply of his Antagoni&s;t, fully an&s;wered what is
<PB N="165" REF="011598_0083_0F877A8E0A4E5610">
here &s;aid; though this writer, in&s;tead of attend|ing to it as he ought, has only repeated, in ef|fect, the &s;ame thing over again. I have nothing therefore to do here, but to quote the Doctor's own words. Says he, 'All this being t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n for granted, yet may not times alter, and admini&s;tra|tions change? Who knows what the next reign and admini&s;tration may be? or whether attempts towards an oppre&s;&s;ive enlargement of power, may not be as much encouraged, ae it is &s;up|po&s;ed they would be frowned on, during the pre&s;ent?' Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> &s;ays further, 'There never was &s;o little pro&s;pect, that a &s;pirit of reli|gious intolerance would revive here,' that is, in England. I heartily wi&s;h there was no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the truth of what is here affirmed. He goes on, 'If it &s;hould, it might not extend to New-England&mdash;But even &s;uppo&s;ing it to reach thither, the effects would be very little by the circum&s;tance of no Bi&s;hop being already placed in America.'&mdash;The Doctor &s;hall &s;peak for him&s;elf here al&s;o. Says he, 'We are cer|tainly much more &s;ecure again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion in the ab&s;ence of Bi&s;hops, than we &s;hould be if they were once fixed here. <HI>Ob&s;ta principiis</HI> was never thought an ill maxim by wi&s;e men,' and &s;o on, with pertinency, the be&s;t part of a page; all which, this writer has been &s;o wi&s;e as to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence. But, &s;ays he, 'The whole appre|hen&s;ion [of bad con&s;equences] is groundle&s;s'. And why? 'The Engli&s;h Di&s;&s;enters, who have &s;ix and twenty Bi&s;hops e&s;tabli&s;hed among them fear no harm from them. Why then &s;hould the New-England Di&s;&s;enters fear any, if one or two &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, with much le&s;s pow|er, in one or two neighbouring Provinces?' It is more than this writer knows, that the Di&s;&s;en|ters
<PB N="166" REF="011598_0084_0F877A8E96D07440">
at home 'fear no harm:' or &s;hould this be true, it is far from being &s;o that they &s;uffer none. They now are, and ever will be, in &s;uf|fering circum&s;tances; unle&s;s the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England is di&s;&s;olved, or great|ly altered from what it is at pre&s;ent. And there is nothing felt or feared by Di&s;&s;enters at home, but we, in this part of the world, may feel, or have rea&s;on to fear, &s;hould the de&s;ired Bi&s;hops be &s;ent to the Colonies. The paragraph we have been con&s;idering is thus concluded, 'So public a declaration as has been made of the model of Epi&s;copacy, propo&s;ed to be followed in Ame|rica, will it&s;elf be an effectual barrier again&s;t any undue exten&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical power; of which the Doctor affects to be &s;o apprehen&s;ive,' This being a meer naked, un&s;upported affirmation, nothing more is needful to be &s;aid upon it, than only to affirm the direct contrary, that it will not be an effectual barrier, and that the Doctor did not affect to be apprehen&s;ive, but really was &s;o, and upon ju&s;t grounds.</P>
<P>THE Doctor ob&s;erved, 'If Bi&s;hops are &s;ent to America, they mu&s;t be well &s;upported; this is beyond doubt. By whom? or by what means?' And here he largely argued to &s;how it to be highly probable, 'that it would be, if not at fir&s;t, yet in time, by a tax laid on the Colonies to this end.' Among other things, he pertinently re|marked, 'If Bi&s;hops were &s;peedily to be &s;ent to America, it &s;eems not wholly improba|ble from what we hear of the unu&s;ual tenor of &s;ome late parliamentary acts and bills, for rai&s;ing money on the poor Colonies <HI>without their con&s;ent,</HI> that provi&s;ion might be made for the &s;upport of the&s;e Bi&s;hops, if not of all the church-clergy al&s;o, in the &s;ame way.' To

all which Mr. <HI>Apthorp</HI> is plea&s;ed to give us the following weighty an&s;wer, 'If no proper maintenance can be found for them, he needs not be unea&s;y at the project of &s;ending them; and that it is not to be at the expence of the Colonies, he has &s;een in Bi&s;hop <HI>Butler</HI>'s &s;cheme, with which the others agree' It is not po&s;&s;ible any one &s;hould have a conception of the pertinency, force, and elegance of the Doctor's objection, as &s;et forth at large in his rea&s;oning upon it, by read|ing only this cur&s;ory, &s;lighty, and, I may &s;ay, trifling an&s;wer to it.</P>
<P>AMONG the inconveniences that might re&s;ult from the appointment of Bi&s;hops in America, the Doctor mentioned the&s;e, 'That, by the increa&s;e of the epi&s;copal party [which might be effected by this appointment, and is doubtle&s;s one principal rea|&s;on why it is &s;o much de&s;ired] they might get a majority in our hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly; that, in con|&s;equence thereof, the church of England might become the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of all the&s;e Co|lonies; that a &s;acramental te&s;t, or &s;omething like it, might en&s;ue, to exclude Non-conformi&s;ts from places, preferment, and civil offices, <HI>as in England</HI>; and that taxes might be impo&s;ed on us all in common, for the maintenance of the&s;e Bi&s;hops, and the epi&s;copal Clergy'.&mdash;Upon the&s;e inconveniences the Doctor argued largely, clo&s;e|ly, and cogently. What now &s;ays Mr. <HI>Ap|thorp?</HI> In taking notice of this objection, he does as he had all along done before, that is, contents him&s;elf with nibling at here and there a &s;entence which he is plea&s;ed to pick out, with|out concerning him&s;elf with the Doctor's whole rea&s;oning in connection. Let us take a view of his reply. Says he, 'The Doctor imagines, that appointing Bi&s;hops in America would probably
<PB N="168" REF="011598_0085_0F877A90766C8A78">
increa&s;e the epi&s;copal party there; and then great evils might follow.' What a poor, lame, lank repre&s;entation is this of what the Doctor had offered! However, let us attend to what follows. 'I cannot di&s;cern in what other way it can increa&s;e their party, than by &s;upplying them more ea&s;ily with a competent number of mini&s;ters; taking care that the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;hould be diligent and exemplary; and promoting an early &s;en&s;e of piety among their young people, The&s;e are no evils.'&mdash;The Doctor never li&s;ped a word in complaint of them as &s;uch. But &s;ure|ly this writer's knowledge of mankind is very &s;canty, if he is capable of 'di&s;cerning' no other ways, than tho&s;e he has &s;pecified, in which the epi&s;copal party might be increa&s;ed. Would the glare of epi&s;copal dignity have no influence upon &s;ome &s;ort of per&s;ons? Would the con|nection of American Bi&s;hops with tho&s;e at home, and their power with great men there, have no effect upon the &s;ons of this world, who might have in view this or the other po&s;t of honor or profit? A variety of other ways might ea&s;ily be mentioned, wherein the epi&s;copal party might be increa&s;ed&mdash;But I forbear. He goes on, 'The Doctor indeed &s;ays, that pretexts might ea&s;ily be found for enlarging the power of the&s;e Bi&s;hops, and increa&s;ing the number.' The re|ply is, 'But enlarging their power would imme|diately rai&s;e a clamour that could not be with|&s;tood.' Is not this as good a rea&s;on, at lea&s;t a very good one, why they &s;hould not be &s;ent at all, unle&s;s with &s;uch powers as are 'altogether from CHRIST, not from the &s;tate?' Should they be &s;ent, would it not rai&s;e a clamour? And if it could be with&s;tood, it would not, perhaps, be with &s;o much ea&s;e as &s;ome may be ready to ima|gine.
<PB N="169" REF="011598_0085_0F877A90766C8A78">
But 'if a few Bi&s;hops proved di&s;agreea|ble, more would not be added.' This is more than this Gentleman knows, or has any authority to affirm. Nay, 'though they &s;hould prove agree|able and u&s;eful, more would be &s;ent only to &s;uch Provinces as cho&s;e them.' Perhaps, by Pro|vinces are meant the comparatively few Epi&s;co|palians that live in them; and by their choice of Bi&s;hops, their being contented with having them &s;ent to them: In this &s;en&s;e, it may be true, 'more Bi&s;hops would be &s;ent only to &s;uch Pro|vinces as cho&s;e them'; but, in the common and ordinary &s;en&s;e in which the&s;e words are under|&s;tood, it is not true, that even the fir&s;t propo&s;ed Bi&s;hops would be &s;ent, or cho&s;en, by any Pro|vince on the Continent. It follows, 'In the &s;hort &s;tay which one of them would choo&s;e to make in New-England, he would not bring over many per&s;ons to our church. And therefore how terrible things &s;oever Epi&s;copalians, if they &s;hould become the majority, may attempt and perform there, they will be almo&s;t, if not quite as likely to accompli&s;h, without a Bi&s;hop a|mong them, as with &s;eeing one now and then.' If Bi&s;hops were &s;ent, though New-England &s;hould not be, at fir&s;t, the place of their re&s;idence, it would be the <HI>dioce&s;s</HI> of one of them; and though, when he came upon a vi&s;itation, he might 'chu&s;e to make but a &s;hort &s;tay,' he would, by rea&s;on of his &s;uperiority in dignity and influence, be able to effect more 'terrible things' than all the Epi&s;copalians put together, &s;hould they be the majority. Mo&s;t certainly, he would not be &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as is de&s;ired, if this 'majority' would be 'almo&s;t, if not quite, as likely' to ac|compli&s;h their &s;chemes 'without ever &s;eeing him, as with &s;eeing him now and then.' This
<PB N="170" REF="011598_0086_0F877A91268AB300">
writer would make us believe, if Epi&s;copalians, by becoming the majority, 'had power, there is no rea&s;on to think they would be oppre&s;&s;ive; for they are not oppre&s;&s;ive in the Colonies where they actually have it: Or that they would at|tempt, for they could not with any mode&s;ty, or any hope of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;uch laws again&s;t the Di&s;|&s;enters, as the Di&s;&s;enters have not attempted again&s;t them.' Is an e&s;tabli&s;hment, obliging Di&s;&s;enters to pay, in common with Epi&s;copalians, towards the &s;upport of the church of England, no degree of oppre&s;&s;ion? Such an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment has been attempted 'with &s;ucce&s;s,' if not with 'mode&s;ty' in one or two of the Colonies, where Epi&s;copalians are the majority;&mdash;Nay, e|ven in New-York, where there are ten to one that are not Epi&s;copalians, epi&s;copal art and po|licy, if I have not been mi&s;informed, has &s;ubjec|ted one County to this &s;ame kind of oppre&s;&s;ion. So that, in&s;tead of there being no rea&s;on to think there would be &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments in all the Colonies, there is the highe&s;t rea&s;on to think this would be the ca&s;e, if Epi&s;copalians &s;hould become the majority. It is added, if the zeal of the New-England Clergy threatens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> danger, Bi&s;hops would temper it, as they have done in England, in&s;tead of inflaming it.' It would tend greatly to the ea&s;e of our minds, if this could be as &s;trongly proved, as it is here affirmed. Bi&s;hops have not been remarkable, in any ages that are pa&s;t, for 'tempering, in&s;tead of inflaming', a zeal in their Clergy that portended danger.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it appears, that this writer had no good foundation for his hope, 'that the Doctor would, on con&s;idering further, endea|vour to reconcile his Countrymen to the admi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="171" REF="011598_0086_0F877A91268AB300">
of Bi&s;hops'; that is, &s;uch Bi&s;hops as the plan propo&s;es &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies. Far from being in the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to this, he was abundantly confirmed in the rea&s;onablene&s;s of what he had wrote to prevent &s;uch a recon|ciliation, by the weakne&s;s of this lame effort to remove away the objections he had made again&s;t the planned American Epi&s;copate.</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>Chandler</HI> now appears again in per|&s;on, and &s;eemingly plea&s;ed, that the offered ob|jections could, 'within a much &s;maller com|pa&s;s, be an&s;wered and confuted.' Without all doubt, was he to be the judge, the confutati|on would be accounted ab&s;olutely complete; but, it is to be remembered, not he, but the im|partial Public are the determiners in this ca&s;e: and, po&s;&s;ibly they may think, the feeble attempt he has made to invalidate the&s;e objections, is ra|ther a confirmation, than a confutation of them.</P>
<P>I COMPLAINED of the Doctor for giving us only a long &s;tring of needle&s;s que&s;tions, in&s;tead of good rea&s;oning, in order to ju&s;tify the propo|&s;ed plan for an American Epi&s;copate. This took up one paragraph. In the next, my de|mand was, 'What right have they to this Epi&s;|copate? How came they by it'? And here I was explicit and large in endeavouring to &s;how, that they had no &s;uch right. What &s;ays the Doctor? He replies, 'I am unable to account for &s;o great a confu&s;ion of ideas as di&s;covers it|&s;elf in the&s;e two paragraphs.' If the fir&s;t of the&s;e paragraphs 'di&s;covers any confu&s;ion of ideas,' it mu&s;t be a confu&s;ion of them in his own mind, or in his manner of expre&s;&s;ing them; for it was nothing more than a repetition of his own que&s;tions, with this application of them, 'Surely he could not imagine, that any man of
<PB N="172" REF="011598_0087_0F877A91A5536F68">
good under&s;tanding would be otherwi&s;e moved by them, than to wonder he &s;hould only harangue, when it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to argue!' As to the 'confu&s;ion' in the other paragraph, it is no|where di&s;covered, unle&s;s in what he has &s;aid up|on it. And, in truth, his arguing here very evi|dently di&s;covers, that his conceptions of it were indi&s;tinct, or rather that he did not under&s;tand it; though it was expre&s;&s;ed as clearly and fully as any thing that was offered on the controver|&s;y. Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> &s;ays he, '&s;eems very &s;trenu|ous to deny that the church of England in Ame|rica has any right to the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed; but then he declares him&s;elf perfectly willing we &s;hould have it.' It is impo&s;&s;ible, if he had en|tertained in his mind a clear and ju&s;t concep|tion of what I had &s;aid, that he &s;hould affirm 'I had declared my&s;elf perfectly willing they &s;hould have the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate,' unle&s;s he had uttered a downright fal&s;hood. I challenges him to produce any &s;entence in this paragraph, or in any other part of my an&s;wer, in which this is declared either directly, or even con&s;equentially. It is indeed a flat contradiction to all that I had &s;aid. What he means, in the following words, by my 'choo&s;ing, perhaps, that this Epi&s;copate &s;hould be granted as a matter of favour, rather than of right,' is beyond me to inve&s;tigate. I &s;aid not a word about 'favour' in this re&s;pect; but confined my&s;elf wholly to the matter of 'right.' It mu&s;t therefore be owing to &s;ome &s;trange 'confu&s;ion in his ideas,' that he &s;hould go on, and inquire, 'What need is there of this di&s;tinction, and to what purpo&s;e will it &s;erve, if it is not to operate again&s;t us?' This is a 'di&s;tinc|tion' intirely of his own framing. It never en|tered into my heart, not is there a word con|tained
<PB N="173" REF="011598_0087_0F877A91A5536F68">
in this whole paragraph that could lead him to make it. It is to me altogether unac|countable, how he came to think of it. He proceeds, 'Our claim is, that we may be upon an equal footing with the other denominations in America.' I have more than once affirmed, and abundantly proved, in the&s;e papers, that they are upon this equal footing; and call upon him to prove the contrary. Says he, 'In order to this, [our being upon an equal footing it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould be allowed the enjoyment of <HI>our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution</HI> in the &s;ame com|pleat manner, as it is enjoyed by them.' By '<HI>our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution,</HI>' he mu&s;t mean here the con&s;titution of the church of England; but to enjoy this in as compleat a manner, as other denominations enjoy their's, is not to enjoy it agreeably to the propo&s;ed plan, but to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of it; as will pre&s;ently appear. He goes on, 'of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution Bi|&s;hops make an e&s;&s;ential part, and therefore with|out an Epi&s;copate we cannot enjoy it.' Nei|ther can they <HI>compleatly</HI> enjoy it with Bi&s;hops, unle&s;s they have authority over the Laity as well as Clergy; for &s;uch authority is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> part of the con&s;titution. Nay further, this con|&s;titution cannot be <HI>compleatly</HI> enjoyed without <HI>&s;piritual courts,</HI> and the exerci&s;e of epi&s;copal au|thority in the <HI>preci&s;e way</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> that has been &s;olemnly e&s;tabli&s;hed by King and Parlia|ment. The Doctor has here in&s;en&s;ibly endea|voured to prove a great deal too much, unle&s;s he intended to give us a remote in&s;inuation of what might be expected, &s;hould the propo&s;ed plan be complied with, namely, that the church of England was not yet in the full and compleat enjoyment of her con&s;titution; her enjoyment mu&s;t ri&s;e &s;till much higher. He adds, 'Our
<PB N="174" REF="011598_0088_0F877A92959A8098">
claim is ju&s;tified by the common principles of human nature, of the chri&s;tian religion, and of civil &s;ociety' If &s;o, the claim is as well found|ed as a claim can be. But what proof has he given us that their claim is thus founded? It follows in the&s;e mo&s;t remarkable words, 'We call it a right becau&s;e all good writers agree in calling a right thus founded by that name.' What is this to the purpo&s;e? Who ever que&s;ti|oned, whether a claim thus founded might be called a right? His bu&s;ine&s;s was to prove, that their claim, or right, to the propo&s;ed Epi&s;co|pate was thus founded, that is, upon the princi|ples he had before &s;pecified. But not a word is offered in proof of this. It re&s;ts upon nothing more than his naked affirmation. He &s;ays yet further, 'For words we do not contend. What we in&s;i&s;t upon is this, that the church of En|gland is, in all re&s;pects, fairly entitled to as full a toleration in the Colonies, as other churches in the Colonies enjoy. And it cannot be thus to|lerated unle&s;s it be &s;uffered to EXIST IN ALL ITS PARTS.' If the church of England cannot be FULLY TOLERATED in the Colonies, unle&s;s it is &s;uffered to EXIST IN ALL ITS PARTS, it is at once evident, that we mu&s;t have in Ameri|ca not only Bi&s;hops, but Deans, Prebends, Arch-Deacons, &s;piritual courts with their Chancellors, and the whole train of officers employed in ma|naging that SPIRITUAL authority which is ex|erci&s;ed over both Clergy and Laity: For the&s;e are PARTS of the con&s;tituted church of England. It is &s;trange the Doctor, while arguing for no|thing more than that limited Epi&s;copate he had propo&s;ed, &s;hould endeavour to do it upon a plan that would make it rea&s;onable, that the church of England &s;hould exi&s;t here IN ALL RE|SPECTS,
<PB N="175" REF="011598_0088_0F877A92959A8098">
and IN ALL ITS PARTS, as it does at home. But he ought to know, that in order to this, &s;omething more than 'a fair and full toleration' would be nece&s;&s;ary. There mu&s;t be an ESTABLISHMENT, which he will not allow he ever thought of; as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently. The plain truth is; as it was 'our bu&s;ine&s;s as opponents,' we have &s;hewn, that the Colony-Epi&s;copalians are treated in preci&s;ely 'the &s;ame manner' with the other denominations&mdash;They are all, without exception, upon the &s;ame foot|ing of liberty, in virtue of the granted tolerati|on; and if Epi&s;copalians do not enjoy any &s;pi|ritual privileges &s;o fully as any of the other de|nominations, it is not owing, in the lea&s;t mea|&s;ure, to the want of a PERMISSION herefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; for the GRANTED PERMISSION is the &s;ame to all; making no manner of difference between one de|nomination and another.</P>
<P>I HAD &s;aid, appeal an&s;wered p. 180, 'If Epi&s;copalians think Bi&s;hops, in the appropriated &s;en&s;e, were con&s;tituted by CHRIST, or his Apo&s;|tles, we object not a word again&s;t their having as many of them as they plea&s;e, if they will be content to have them with authority ALTOGE|THER FROM CHRIST. But they both claim and de&s;ire, a great deal more. They want to be di&s;tingui&s;hed 'by having Bi&s;hops upon the foot|ing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT'? I then went on to argue &s;omewhat largely again&s;t their having a right to &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Doctor replies, 'Where did he learn that we want Bi|&s;hops upon &s;uch a footing?' and affirms, 'That I could learn it, neither from the appeal, or from any thing that has been publi&s;hed on the &s;ide of the church;' yea, he &s;olemnly declares, 'I know of no &s;uch thing, I have &s;een nothing that has
<PB N="176" REF="011598_0089_0F877A9420CCED48">
been written, &s;ince the reign of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> either in England or America, in print or in manu&s;cript, that indicates &s;uch a de&s;ire'. He goes on yet farther, and &s;ays, 'I have met with nothing in conver&s;ation with Clergymen or Laymen, in or out of convention, from whence I can learn or &s;u&s;|pect, that there is an Epi&s;copalian, within the Briti&s;h dominions, that aims at or expects an Epi&s;copate here upon the footing of a &s;tate e&s;ta|bli&s;hment'. The Doctor, when he wrote thus, mu&s;t have had in his thoughts an e&s;tabli&s;hment for the &s;upport of the epi&s;copal Clergy, either &s;uperior, or inferior, or both. In this view, an e&s;tabli&s;hment was not propo&s;ed in the 'appeal,' nor is it pleaded for in the writings on the &s;ide of the church that I know of; nor can I &s;ay, that it was ever mentioned by the convention: Though I am far from thinking it to be a truth, that there is no Clergyman or Layman, in the American Colonies, that does not expect and wi&s;h, that an e&s;tabli&s;hment upon this footing, will be brought into event &s;ooner or later. I &s;aid no|thing about &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment. But an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and a &s;tate one too, mu&s;t take place, or the church of England here can never have the Epi&s;copate that has been propo&s;ed and de&s;ired. The Doctor will own, the Epi&s;copate that has been planned for the Colonies is widely different from that which exi&s;ts at home. American Bi|&s;hops &s;hall have no authority over the Laity;&mdash; their &s;piritual courts mu&s;t not be held in this part of the world;&mdash;and they them&s;elves are to be confined in their power within certain pre|&s;cribed boundaries. How is all this to be ac|compli&s;hed? Mu&s;t there not be the interpo&s;i|tion of the &s;tate? Can it be effected in any
<PB N="177" REF="011598_0089_0F877A9420CCED48">
other way? And if the &s;tate interpo&s;es to con|&s;titute a Colony Epi&s;copate, it mu&s;t be under their patronage, guidance, and controul, as to the ex|erci&s;e of its powers. And what is this, in real meaning, but an e&s;tabli&s;hment? The church of England, in this ca&s;e, will be di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the other denominations; and, in&s;tead of be|ing only tolerated as they are, will be as truly, if not as fully, an e&s;tabli&s;hed church here, as it is in Great-Britain. But Colony-Epi&s;copalians have no right to be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed; as was abundantly proved in an&s;wer to the appeal, to which the Doctor has &s;aid nothing by way of reply, for no other rea&s;on, it may well be &s;up|po&s;ed, but becau&s;e he could not. If he had here pointed out, as it was his proper bu&s;ine&s;s to do, the way in which the Epi&s;copate propo&s;ed in the appeal, and by the writers on the &s;ide of the church, could be carried into effect without a <HI>&s;tate-e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> he would have &s;aid &s;omething to the purpo&s;e; but, having wi&s;ely avoid|ed this, we are left to think, the American Epi&s;copate they have planned is virtually, and in reality of &s;en&s;e, the &s;ame thing with a planned epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is to us incon|ceivable, how their de&s;ired Epi&s;copate could, in any other way, take place in the Colonies. In vain therefore does he complain, that 'they are abu&s;ed by petulent tongues and abu&s;ive pens for being charged with aiming at a &s;tate e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.' We &s;hould feel 'remor&s;e of con|&s;cience, if we did not without he&s;itation' object again&s;t the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate for this very rea&s;on, becau&s;e, by aiming at it, an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Epi&s;copacy in America is equally aim|ed at. The impartial Public are to determine, not Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> whether they are ju&s;tly char|ged, or 'unwarrantably condemned.'</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="011598_0090_0F877A94D244E910">HE &s;till goes on, in his defence, a number of pages; but, as there is &s;carce any thing in them that relates to the <HI>grand point,</HI> and nothing, &s;o far as I am able to judge, of &s;ufficient weight to call for particular notice; if the reader will only compare what he has offered in the&s;e pages, with the an&s;wer to the appeal, I am per|fectly willing, without &s;aying a word more, to leave the di&s;pute to the determination of his im|partial judgment. But, at the &s;ame time, I would a&s;&s;ure the Doctor, that his 'fear,' lea&s;t he &s;hould have '&s;omewhat broken in upon my re|po&s;e,' is entirely groundle&s;s. He may fondly imagine, he has 'pleaded the cau&s;e he under|took' with &s;uch &s;uperiority of good &s;en&s;e, and &s;ound rea&s;oning, as to give me 'di&s;turbance;' but he has been the occa&s;ion of no other unea|&s;ine&s;s to me than that of di&s;appointment; for he has fallen much below my wi&s;hes as well as expectations; not having wrote &s;o as to give opportunity for a tryal of &s;trength. He has candidly excu&s;ed my in&s;ufficiency, as it was my hard lot to prove, 'that good is evil, and evil good; that darkne&s;s is light, and light is dark|ne&s;s, which could not be done without '&s;uch a genius and abilities as are not to be found'. I wi&s;h I could make &s;o good an apology for him. His ta&s;k was ea&s;y. He had only to plead the cau&s;e of truth; and yet, he has done it with &s;o little appearance of ingenuous &s;olid arguing, that, I fear, his cau&s;e will &s;uffer in the opinion of all that are capable of di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>I INTENDED to have come to a conclu&s;ion here, by pre&s;enting to the reader, in one view, the &s;um of what has been &s;aid on both &s;ides, that he might the more ea&s;ily make a judgment in the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But I mu&s;t omit this, that I may have

room for a matter of much greater importance; the treatment of the Pre&s;byterian church at New-York, in relation to the charter they peti|tioned for, both to the government there, and to the King at home. And I the rather chu&s;e to hold this up to public view, as it is an alarm to all the Colonies on the Continent, giving them &s;olemn notice what they may expect, &s;hould Epi&s;copalians ever come to have the &s;uperiority in their influence. Nothing has been offered, in a way of rea&s;oning, again&s;t the planned Ame|rican Epi&s;copate, that carries with it &s;uch FEEL|ING FORCE as the negative to the prayer of this petition, with the rea&s;ons upon which it is grounded.</P>
<P>THAT the reader may perceive the propriety of my introducing this affair, I would ju&s;t re|mind him, that the Doctor, in his appeal, had &s;poken of the 'mildne&s;s, tenderne&s;s, and mo|deration of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops for a cour&s;e of years pa&s;t;' in&s;omuch, that they had '&s;carcely afforded an in&s;tance of rea&s;onable complaint, e&s;pecially to Di&s;&s;enters:' In an&s;wer whereto, he was told of the rejection of the petition of the Presbyterian church at New-York for a char|ter;' which was effected through the interpo&s;i|tion, particularly, of the Bi&s;hop of London, oc|ca&s;ioned, without all doubt, by ungenerous re|pre&s;entations from Epi&s;copalians in America.</P>
<P>As I am not, from per&s;onal knowledge, ac|quainted with this affair any more than the Doc|tor, what I propo&s;e is to hand to the Public, in an appendix, the clear, full, and yet conci&s;e, ac|count of it, which has been tran&s;mitted to me from New-York: previou&s;ly giving this intima|tion, that the facts, contained in the account to

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE true hi&s;tory of the various applications of the Pre&s;byterians of the City of New-York for a charter, and of their various di&s;appointments, is &s;uccinctly this.</P>
<P>A number of Gentlemen purcha&s;ed a lot of ground in 1719, for the erecting of a church to wor&s;hip in, af|ter the mode of the e&s;tabli&s;hed per&s;ua&s;ion in North-Britain. There was not then in this Colony, nor is there to this day, any general provi&s;ion made by law, for the regulation of churches, or for the &s;upport of the Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel&mdash;It is therefore expedient in this Country, for the pre&s;ervation of the temporalities of every church, and the maintenance of good order, that the congregation be incorporated&mdash;Charters for &s;uch purpo&s;es had been granted to the low Dutch, and epi&s;copal churches; and the Colony being peopled from Scotland as well as England, the Scotch founders of the Pre&s;byterian church in New-York, thought they had rea&s;on to hope government would not be le&s;s fa|vourable to them, than to the Emigrants from South-Britain; and could not imagine that the &s;ons of the church of Scotland, united to England by act of Par|liament, and the ties of allegiance as natural born &s;ubjects, were not to have equal countenance, with tho&s;e of the foreign reformed church of the united Ne|therlands, between which and the church of Scotland, there is no e&s;&s;ential di&s;parity, and very little even in point of meer form. With confidence therefore they pre&s;ented a petition to Col. <HI>Schyler,</HI> who commanded in chief in 1721, for letters of incorporation. The Epi&s;copalians oppo&s;ed the grant, though they were them&s;elves then ju&s;t emerging from their ob&s;curity; for, at that time, the low Dutch congregations figured
<PB N="ii" REF="011598_0092_0F877A9625838FB8">
as the fir&s;t churches in Town, and are &s;till the mo&s;t numerous, though many of their riche&s;t families are gone off for the &s;ake of the language, to the Engli&s;h churches. When Governor <HI>Burnet</HI> arrived, the Pre&s;by|terians renewed their attempt, and the ve&s;try of trinity church their oppo&s;ition. They were heard again&s;t the petition, and to the &s;candal of the council-board were indulged in their contemptible narrow minded bigotry. The Governor, though favorably inclined to his country|men, was unwilling to proceed without direction from home&mdash;He wrote to the board of trade in 1724, and their Lord&s;hips con&s;ulted Coun&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or <HI>We&s;t,</HI> who &s;ub&s;cri|bed an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion in the following terms.</P>
<P>'UPON con&s;ideration of the &s;everal acts of unifor|mity that have pa&s;&s;ed in Great-Britain I am of opinion, that they do not extend to New-York, and con&s;equently an act of toleration is of no u&s;e in that Province; and therefore, as there is no provincial act for uniformity ac|cording to the church of England, I am of opinion, that by law &s;uch patents of incorporation may be granted as by the petition is de&s;ired.</P>
<P><HI>Richard We&s;t,</HI> Aug. 20. 1724.</P>
<P>No charter could however be obtained, and di&s;cou|raged by &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s &s;ollicitations, the congregation for the pre&s;ervation of their e&s;tate, ve&s;ted it in March 1730, in the general a&s;&s;embly of the church of Scotland, who &s;till hold the fee, but have i&s;&s;ued a declaration continuing the application of it, to the pious u&s;es, for which it was originally purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all oppo&s;ition, the Scotch church flouri&s;hed under the long and laborious mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> who &s;ettled here in 1727; and when the Lutherans applied for a charter to Lieutenant Governor <HI>Delancy</HI> in 1759, the Pre&s;byterians made a third application&mdash;The Lutherans were encouraged by gentlemen then in the council, who promi&s;ed to be-friend them; and the Pre&s;byterians by favourable ex|pre&s;&s;ions from the Lieutenant Governor, who had fre|quently declared his abhorrence of the former oppo&s;ition as illegal and unrea&s;onable; and when the petition was preferred, he received Mr. <HI>Bo&s;twick,</HI> the then Mini&s;ter, and his Elders and Deacons, politely, and profe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="iii" REF="011598_0092_0F877A9625838FB8">
his readine&s;s to grant their reque&s;t, if the Council would concur.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Smith,</HI> &s;ince one of the Judges, was one of the board, when the petition of the Presbyterians was read, and referred to a committee; but no opportunity was given for a trial of Mr. <HI>Delancey</HI>'s &s;incerity: for Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> the only Non-epi&s;copalian member, was cho&s;en chairman of the Committee, and was unable to pre|vail upon the re&s;t of the council to meet; and, if he could, would have lo&s;t his own vote by being in the chair.</P>
<P>OBLIGING the Lutherans at that time, if any &s;uch in|tention there really was, would have di&s;covered a parti|ality too barefaced; and therefore, while the Presbyte|rians petition was neglected, that of the Lutherans was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily pretended to be put in a way for obtaining the royal order from home; and thus the council were to be behind the curtain, and avoid popular cen&s;ure.&mdash;It &s;o happened however, and perhaps by intriegues from this quarter, that the Lords of trade could not &s;ee it ex|pedient to advi&s;e the gratification of their reque&s;t; and accordingly a letter came from their Lord&s;hips to Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olden,</HI> which cut off the rea&s;onable expectations of that &s;ociety of loyal Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>THE Presbyterians had experienced many inconveni|ences for want of a charter; and though the ju&s;t, and generous admini&s;tration of Sir <HI>Henry Moore,</HI> prompted them to make a fourth attempt, yet upon a doubt now &s;tarted, whether his commi&s;&s;ion authori&s;ed him to grant incorporating patents, and from a want of confi|dence in his council, it was thought mo&s;t prudent to lay the ca&s;e, of this di&s;tant di&s;per&s;ion of the church of Scotland, before his Maje&s;ty&mdash;A petition was accord|ingly prepared, and tran&s;mitted with a draft of the charter de&s;ired in March, 1767.</P>
<P>THE negotiation of this bu&s;ine&s;s was tru&s;ted to the late Dr. <HI>Samuel Chandler,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Debert</HI>; but it fell &s;olely upon the latter, Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> dying about the time of the arrival of the papers in London. The Earl of Dartmouth, &s;o renowned for his catholici&s;m, and readine&s;s to promote the intere&s;t of our common chri&s;tianity, then pre&s;ided at the board of trade, and en|tered
<PB N="iv" REF="011598_0093_0F877A96DAC414D0">
fully into an opinion of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the reque&s;t, and advi&s;ed Mr. <HI>Debert</HI> to put the petition in|to the King's hand, before the co-operation of cer|tain friends, who&s;e aid was a&s;ked, could be obtained.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to lay the petition before the Lords of the privy council, and to refer it to the board of trade. The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Plan|tation affairs &s;u&s;pended a report, until they had an an&s;wer, from Sir <HI>Henry Moore,</HI> to a letter they wrote to him on the 29th of July, 1766.</P>
<P>THIS letter was accompanied with a copy of the pe|tition and the draft of the charter&mdash;They were all com|municated by the Governor to his council; and on the 17th of July, 1767, the petitioners offered to attend the call of the board, for the &s;upport of their allegati|ons, by a petition which was that day read in coun|cil, and left with their clerk, for the u&s;e of the com|mittee.&mdash;A few days after Mr. <HI>Hor&s;emanden,</HI> as the olde&s;t member of the board, was waited upon to ap|point a time to receive a reque&s;t for this purpo&s;e, but declined it.</P>
<P>NO report was delivered until the 15th of April, al|though the letter from the Lords of trade arrived here on the 4th of November preceding, and there were many in|termediate meetings of the council. I believe the mi|nutes will prove that the members met every week.&mdash; At one of the&s;e meetings, in the latter end of March, the Chief Ju&s;tice was called out, and in an&s;wer to an intreaty for a &s;peedy report to the Governor, &s;aid with tartne&s;s '<HI>That the matter need not be pu&s;hed, and that he wi&s;hed the government had not troubled them with the peti|tion</HI>'. A Gentleman took the liberty to &s;ay, that all the Lords of trade required was to be informed, whe|ther the allegations were true; to which he replied, '<HI>Of that there is no doubt.</HI>'</P>
<P>THE report appears, however, by its date, to have been fini&s;hed about that time. We do not learn, that the committee were waited upon <HI>now</HI> by the ve&s;try of trinity church, nor was it nece&s;&s;ary, as their church war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ens were of the council. Mr. Chief Ju&s;tice was one, and Mr. <HI>Reade</HI> the other, and as chairman of the committee had the honour to make their report.
<PB N="v" REF="011598_0093_0F877A96DAC414D0">
That it was not earlier delivered, may be imputed to a de&s;ire to render the petition abortive, or to the then tickli&s;h &s;tate of things, a di&s;&s;olution of the a&s;&s;embly in pur&s;uance of a &s;eptennial act being at hand, and <HI>James Delancey</HI> named as a candidate for the City of New-York, who had two uncles in council, zealous for the public confidence, and intere&s;ted in retarding a report which would naturally give offence; but the Gover|nor's importunity forced them to &s;peak out.&mdash;It does not appear that there was a &s;ingle member di&s;&s;enting to this report.</P>
<P>THE petitioners a&s;ked for a copy on the 20th of April, 1767, but this reque&s;t was denied, and by this means their adver&s;aries had frequent opportunity for ex parte repre&s;entations again&s;t the mea&s;ure, in a cour&s;e of private corre&s;pondence; which was doubtle&s;s im|proved by the Clergy, and the draft&s;men who fabricated the report.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Henry Moore</HI> lo&s;t no time in tran&s;mitting it.&mdash; The petitioners (who one would imagine had a right to be heard) were ignorant of its contents, and under all po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantages; nor could give any &s;utable directions to their Agent.&mdash;Whether the council kept the &s;ecret from the Epi&s;copalians without doors, judge you. The Bi&s;hop of London, notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ted moderation of the order, appeared twice to op|po&s;e the petition before the Commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and Plantations, as thought he grant of the privilege, of &s;ecuring a hou&s;e &s;et apart by Prote&s;tants, wor&s;hipping according to the u&s;age in North Britain, was repug|nant to the benevolence enjoined by the go&s;pel of CHRIST: and though Lord <HI>Clare,</HI> who&s;e zeal for li|berty, and the rights of private judgment, may be ar|gued from a well known event in the hi&s;tory of his life, was then premier at the board of trade, a report was made to his Maje&s;ty, which &s;oon after i&s;&s;ued in a final rejection of the petition. In this report, the que&s;tion, Whether his Maje&s;ty, con&s;i&s;tently with the obli|gations he was under by his coronation oath, founded on the act of the fifth of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> entitled, 'an act for &s;ecuring the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,' could grant the reque&s;ted charter, being left undecided; the
<PB N="vi" REF="011598_0094_0F877A979D266ED0">
report was, it would be 'inexpedient, upon the princi|ples of general policy, to give the Pre&s;byterian church of New-York any other privileges than it is entitled to by the law of toleration.'</P>
<P>WHATEVER liberties the people of England may think fit to take at this day, in remarking upon the acts of their Sovereign, the Americans conceive them&s;elves bound to &s;peak on &s;uch occa&s;ions, with the mo&s;t pro|found deference. The light, however, in which his &s;ervants have thought fit to hold up the reque&s;t of the Scotch church of New-York, every man may never|thele&s;s con&s;ider and animadvert upon with &s;ome free|dom. They are an&s;werable to the whole world for their conduct; and have proceeded upon a principle, that de&s;erves the con&s;ideration of all the Colonies. No|thing has contributed more to the acqui&s;ition and cul|tivation of the&s;e e&s;&s;ential parts of the Empire, than the &s;ea&s;onable and well policed a&s;&s;urance we have had for free indulgence in matters of religion: And a repug|nant &s;pirit will be as ruinous to our peace and pro&s;pe|rity, as it is di&s;graceful to a Gentleman, and incon|&s;i&s;tent with religion and philo&s;ophy, freedom of enquiry, and human felicity. We have &s;een an A&mdash;m-&s;&mdash;n of corrupt and di&s;&s;olute M-n&mdash;rs, mercile&s;sly gra&s;p|ing at our liberties and e&s;tates; and it is &s;ome con&s;ola|tion, that our di&s;appointment in a reque&s;t friendly to the rights of con&s;cience, may be attributed to men, who&s;e influence at the court of a good King, will probably very &s;oon be at an end.</P>
<P>I ONLY add, that although there have long &s;ince been petitions preferred <HI>here,</HI> by the French Prote&s;tants, and the Low Dutch churches of Orange Town, New-Hemp&s;ted, Marble Town, Bodche&s;ter and Wawar&s;ing, nothing final is determined upon them; while it is the u&s;ual practice, to grant charters to the epi&s;co|pal churches without the lea&s;t he&s;itation. It is not long, &s;ince the little congregation at Albany was in|corporated with power to hold an immen&s;e revenue. Another patent is i&s;&s;ued to provide for Clergymen's widows, by an income of many thou&s;ands per annum; and at this very juncture the Society for propagating the go&s;pel, though re&s;trained from taking real e&s;tates at home, are a&s;king for grants of the crown lands here in mortmain for the epi&s;copal churches, to the amount
<PB N="vii" REF="011598_0094_0F877A979D266ED0">
of thou&s;ands of acres. In &s;ome in&s;tances they have been gratified already. The&s;e facts are mentioned, to &s;hew the &s;pirit of the oppo&s;ition to the petitions of the non-epi&s;copal churches, who, in&s;tead of &s;oliciting for ample endowments, de&s;ire nothing more than <HI>purcha|&s;ed</HI> e&s;tates, barely &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of the go&s;|pel; and to ju&s;tify our fears that the pre&s;ent &s;truggles of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries and others to introduce Epi&s;copacy in|to America, originate from ambitious de&s;igns for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulent hierarchy in this Country, with prelatical di&s;tinction and power.</P>
<P>THE reader will not, I tru&s;t, be out of patience, if he is detained, while I <HI>contra&s;t</HI> the above account with an <HI>act</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-government,</HI> con&s;picuously exemplifying that candour, fairne&s;s, and impartial equi|ty in <HI>Non-Epi&s;copalians,</HI> which were &s;o remarkably wanting in tho&s;e of the contrary denomination, with reference to the affair that has been ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>act,</HI> having had the ROYAL SANCTION, with|out the lea&s;t ob&s;truction from the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;y pretence of 'a breach of the coronation-oath,' or a 'violation of any acts of uniformity,' or its being 'incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound policy,' has, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of the reign of George the 2nd, been a &s;tanding law of this Province.</P>
<P>IT was occa&s;ioned by a motion made in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, in behalf of the Pa&s;tors and Deacons of the church to which I am related, that they might be &s;trengthened in their endeavours to &s;ecure the payment of an annuity, given to them by will, out of the rents of a valuable farm, to be by them yearly di&s;po&s;ed of for|ever for the benefit of a well-di&s;po&s;ed, and promi&s;ing, but needy, &s;tudent at <HI>Harvard</HI>-College, in Cambridge. It was at once thought, that this was a matter of com|mon concern; and, accordingly, an act was prepar|ed, and pa&s;&s;ed by both hou&s;es, (in which, unle&s;s we &s;hould except one or two, there were no epi&s;co|pal members) and readily &s;igned by the Governor; taking in all Prote&s;tant denominations, EPISCOPA|LIANS by name: And the whole was done of their own m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er motion, under the influence of candor, ho|nour, and a becoming &s;en&s;e of the regard that ought to be paid to the rule of right, without partiality. Epi&s;|copal applications were not needed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they
<PB N="viii" REF="011598_0095_0F877A98638A1948">
made. The act, wherein it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be recited, is as follows,</P>
<P>'<HI>WHEREAS many grants and donations have heretofore been made by &s;undry well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, in and by &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions and terms as plainly &s;how it was the intent and expectation of &s;uch grantors and donors, that their &s;everal grants and donations &s;hould take effect &s;o as that the e&s;tates granted &s;hould go in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: But doubts have ari&s;en in what ca&s;es &s;uch donations and grants may ope|rate, &s;o as to go in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI>:</P>
<P>For a&s;certaining whereof:</P>
<P>'BE it enacted by the GOVERNOR, COUNCIL, and hou&s;e of REPRESENTATIVES, That the Deacons of all the &s;everal Prote&s;tant churches, not being epi&s;copal churches, and the <HI>Church Wardens</HI> of the &s;everal <HI>epi&s;|copal</HI> churches, are, and &s;hall be, deemed &s;o far <HI>bodies corporate,</HI> as to take in <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> all grants and donations, whether real or per&s;onal, made either to their &s;everal churches, the poor of their churches, or to them and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and to &s;ue and defend in all actions touch|ing the &s;ame; and wherever the Mini&s;ters, Elders or Ve&s;try &s;hall in &s;uch original grants or donations have been joined with &s;uch D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Church Wardens as donees or gran|tees in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;uch officers and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, together with the Deacons or Church War|dens, &s;hall be deemed the corporation for &s;uch purpo&s;es as afore&s;aid. And the Mini&s;ter or Mini&s;ters of the &s;e|veral prote&s;tant churches of whatever denomination, are and &s;hall be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">med capable of taking in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion any par&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age land, or lands granted to the Mini&s;ter and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, or to the u&s;e of the Mini&s;ters, and of &s;uing and defending all act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons touching the &s;ame; &s;aving that nothing in this act &s;hall be con&s;trued to make void any final judgment of any court of common law or Judge of probate; &s;aving al&s;o, that no alienation of any lands belonging to churches hereafter made by the Deacons without the con&s;ent of the church or a com|mittee of the church for that purpo&s;e appointed, or by Church W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdens without the con&s;ent of the Ve&s;try, &s;hall be &s;ufficient to pa&s;s the &s;ame. And that no alienation hereafter made by Mini&s;ters of lands by them held in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hall be valid any longer than during
<PB N="ix" REF="011598_0095_0F877A98638A1948">
&s;uch alienors continuing Mini&s;ters, unle&s;s &s;uch Mini|&s;ters be Mini&s;ters of particular Towns, Di&s;tricts, or Precincts, and make &s;uch alienation with the con&s;ent of &s;uch Towns, Di&s;tricts, or Precincts, or unle&s;s &s;uch Mini&s;ters &s;o aliening be Mini&s;ters of Epi&s;copal Churches, and the &s;ame be done with the con&s;ent of the Ve&s;try'.&mdash;</P>
<P>HAD <HI>Epi&s;copalians</HI> at New-York been in the exerci&s;e of like candor and impartiality with <HI>Non-epi&s;copalians</HI> in this Province, their Pre&s;byterian brethren would have met with no difficulty in obtaining, from the Govern|ment there, the charter they de&s;ired: Nor, had they &s;ent no ungenerous unfriendly repre&s;entations to dig|nified Clergymen at home, is it in the lea&s;t probable the KING would have rejected the petition they made to him. As there was no <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts act,</HI> it readily obtained the KING's <HI>fiat.</HI> And there is no rea&s;on to think, but he would as rea|dily have granted the <HI>charter</HI> petitioned for, by the New-York Pre&s;byterians, as it meant preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-act,</HI> had not epi&s;co|palian Yorkers, in council, or out of council, or both, tran&s;mitted &s;uch illiberal accounts, to great men in Eng|land, as excited their zeal, and urged them on to endea|vours to bring this petition to naught.</P>
<P>IT is to be hoped, the generous candor, and impar|tial ju&s;tice, exemplified by the non-epi&s;copal Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Province, will have &s;ome good effect upon Epi&s;copalians in the other Colonies. It is powerfully adapted to &s;uch a purpo&s;e; and cannot well fail, if duly con&s;idered, of putting to &s;hame that narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit, that bigotry of &s;entiment, and party-partiality, which are incon&s;i&s;tent with a freedom in doing to others, as we would they &s;hould do to us. It may rea&s;onably be expected, the noble example of undi&s;tingui&s;hed can|dor and goodne&s;s, that has been brought to view, will engage the New-York Epi&s;copalians, from a &s;en&s;e of honour, friendline&s;s, impartiality, and ju&s;tice, heartily to join with the Pre&s;byterians there in endeavours, that they may be put upon the &s;ame equitable footing with them&s;elves, by being favoured with a charter of incor|poration for the temporalities of their church. Unle&s;s there &s;hould be the di&s;covery of &s;uch a temper and con|duct,
<PB N="x" REF="011598_0096_0F877A9934EAC0C0">
in vain it will be to expect, that our fears, re&s;|pecting the propo&s;ed American Epi&s;copate, &s;hould be &s;ilenced. If Epi&s;copalians of inferior &s;tation, and com|paratively &s;mall importance, can, by handing accounts to dignitaries at home, effect &s;uch mi&s;chief to the other denominations, what may not be feared from the in|fluence of Bi&s;hops, re&s;iding in the Colonies!</P>
