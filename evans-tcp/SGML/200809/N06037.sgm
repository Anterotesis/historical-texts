<P>THIS Chapter begins with a Prophecy of Times of Di&s;tre&s;s and Sorrow coming on <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> named here <HI>Ariel,</HI> which &s;ignify's <HI>the Lion of God.</HI> It might be &s;o called, either becau&s;e it was a great and &s;trong City, thought to be impregnable; or becau&s;e it was the Royal City, where King <HI>David</HI> had his Throne, who was a &s;ignal Type and Ance&s;tor of the holy <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Lion</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah;</HI> or becau&s;e it was the City GOD had cho&s;en for his own Habitation, and fortify'd by his Pre&s;ence; or becau&s;e there was the <HI>Altar of God</HI> for <HI>Burnt-offering</HI> (&s;ometimes called <HI>Ariel</HI>) which was a nota|ble
<PB N="2" REF="007665_0003_102DBA86DE79F0E0">
Symbol of the Divine Pre&s;ence, the chief Strength and Glory of the City, and which as a <HI>Lion</HI> devoured the Sacri|fices offered thereon continually.&mdash;Yet, Iniquity being found in this Favourite-City of God, here's a WO denounced again&s;t it. The Inhabitants are a&s;&s;ured by the Prophet, that notwith&s;tanding all their Temple-Privileges, on Account of which they &s;eemed to have a <HI>Lion-like</HI> Fortitude and Confidence, they &s;hould for their Sins be <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>brought down</HI> wonderfully: and that all their Oblations and Devotions, whereby they thought to appea&s;e an incen&s;ed God, &s;hould be vain, and not &s;erve to &s;ecure them again&s;t the Judg|ments, which their abounding Iniquity de&s;erved. They might go on killing their Sacrifices, making many Prayers, and multiplying their publick Solemnities; yet none of the&s;e Things &s;hould profit them at all, but a righteous and provoked God would &s;till pur&s;ue his Controver&s;y with them.</P>
<P>Alas, we may flatter our &s;elves, and deceive our Neighbours, with a Form of Godline&s;s, and a fair Shew in the Fle&s;h; but the omni&s;cient Eye of Him with whom we have to do, can &s;ee thro' the thicke&s;t Ma&s;k of Hypocri&s;y: and as He is not capable of being deluded, &s;o neither will He bear to be mocked, with heartle&s;s Services, and meer external For|malities in Religion. The mo&s;t &s;plendid and abundant Oblations, exclu&s;ive of a <HI>broken Heart</HI> and a <HI>contrite Spirit,</HI> which are the <HI>Sacrifices of God,</HI> will never plea&s;e Him; much le&s;s avail to appea&s;e his offended Ju&s;tice, and atone for our Sins. But notwith&s;tanding all &s;uch Attempts to &s;tay the Current of Divine Judg|ments, God's Hand will be &s;tretched out &s;till; nor will He turn away his Anger from us, while our Hearts remain unhumbled, and our Sins unrepented.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007665_0004_102DBA8B1D368FB8">
The Prophet here lets the People of <HI>Ariel</HI> know, that however they might <HI>add Year to Year,</HI> proceed to keep their annual Fa&s;ts, &amp; from time to time abound in their expiatory <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> &s;tated and occa&s;ional; yet, &s;eeing they were a People impenitent and unreformed, a holy God would maintain his Controver&s;y with them, and te&s;tify his ju&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure in a Succe&s;&s;ion of wa&s;t|ing and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Judgments; again&s;t which all their Helpers &s;hould afford them no Protection: but in Ca&s;e of final Ob&s;tinacy, their De&s;truction &s;hould be &s;ure and inevitable; and their De&s;olation &s;hould come <HI>in an In&s;tant &s;uddenly,</HI> when they were not aware, by Means unthought of, &s;ubject only to the Direction of Divine Providence, and uncontroulable by all the Power of Mortals.&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited of the Lord of Ho&s;ts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and great Noi&s;e, with Storm and Tempe&s;t, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Some under&s;tand the Prophet as &s;peaking <HI>metaphori|cally;</HI> u&s;ing this Variety &amp; Pomp of Words only to ex|pre&s;s the very mi&s;erable State the People of <HI>Ariel</HI> would be reduced to, by the numerous and great Calamities ha&s;tning upon them.&mdash;But whether we are to take the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in a <HI>figurative,</HI> or in a <HI>literal</HI> Sen&s;e, I &s;hall not now &s;tand to di&s;pute. Doubtle&s;s both Con|&s;tructions may be &s;afely admitted. Yet I chu&s;e at pre&s;ent to follow the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Text, as the Gene|rality of Expo&s;itors view it in that Light, and as the De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e principally is to lead you into &s;ome devout Reflections, &s;uitable to the late tremen|dous Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, which are the &s;pe|cial Occa&s;ion of the Appointment of this Day of gene|ral Humiliation and Prayer; I mean, tho&s;e great and terrible <HI>Earthquakes in divers Places,</HI> whereby &s;ome noted Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> have been de&s;troyed, and where|with we in <HI>America</HI> have been alarmed.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007665_0005_102DBA8C9F056FD0">
I might profitably employ &s;ome Meditations on the other Articles enumerated in the Divine Threatning before us; which are of Importance enough to claim our Attention. But for the &s;ake of Brevity, as well as Pertinence, I have &s;ingled out <HI>That,</HI> &s;ome In&s;tances of which gave Ri&s;e to this Day's Solemnity, for the particular Subject of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts,&mdash;with Earthquake and great Noi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the&s;e Words, I propo&s;e to pur&s;ue the following Method. Fir&s;t, I &s;hall take Notice of the <HI>Character,</HI> by which the Divine Maje&s;ty is here de|&s;cribed; <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;Then &s;peak of his <HI>vi&s;iting</HI> his People.&mdash;And of his doing this particularly by <HI>Earthquake and great Noi&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Finally, apply the Subject, in &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable Reflections and Exhortations, as the Time will allow.</P>
<P>I. I am to &s;ay &s;omething upon the exalted <HI>Character,</HI> under which GOD is here &s;poken of; <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet now &s;peaking in the <HI>Name</HI> of God, and delivering a Divine Me&s;&s;age and Menace to his People, he fitly in&s;erts this Divine <HI>Character,</HI> to give the greater Weight and Importance to his Words, by pointing out the <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible Author</HI> of the Judgments denounced in that awful Threatning, which the Prophet was only the Me&s;&s;enger to bring unto them. He might have contented him&s;elf with barely &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited</HI> with this and the other Judgment: but it gives an additional Force and Empha&s;is to his Words, there's a &s;acred Energy, a peculiar Dignity, Maje&s;ty and Solemnity in the Language, when he &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts.</HI> His naming the Divine Being, under this augu&s;t Character, tended to &s;trike an Awe upon the threatned People, to draw Attention to the Prophecy, and indeed to per&s;uade to
<PB N="5" REF="007665_0006_102DBA8E21CB0810">
the Belief of it. For the in&s;erting of GOD's Name in this terrible Commination, was an implicitly pawn|ing of GOD's Veracity for the Truth of it: and the Mention of Him under &s;o grand a Character, carry'd in it a further Motive of Credibility, re&s;pecting the Certainty of the Event; &s;ince there can be no re&s;i&s;t|ing the Power, nor flying from the Pre&s;ence, of Him who is <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts.</HI>&mdash;It is ob&s;ervable, the Judgments, &s;pecify'd in this Denunciation, are &s;uch as carry with them very legible Signatures of <HI>the Fin|ger of GOD.</HI> Natural Rea&s;on apprehends an invi&s;i|ble almighty Agent very eminently &amp; more immediately operating in them. <HI>Thunder,</HI> &amp; <HI>Earthquake,</HI> &amp; <HI>Tem|pe&s;t,</HI> &amp; <HI>the Flame of devouring Fire</HI> (e&s;pecially if this be under&s;tood of the Lightning from Heaven, or the &s;corching Beams of the Sun, or the Eruption of &s;ubter|raneous Fire) the&s;e are &s;uch Events as evidently claim the great GOD for their prime Efficient, and exclude all human Agency. When therefore the Prophet was denouncing a WO to <HI>Ariel,</HI> which it was GOD's &s;ole Prerogative to execute, there mu&s;t be allowed a De|cency and Fitne&s;s in the Thing, that he &s;hould ex|plicitly mention GOD's Name in the Denunciation, and that he &s;hould mention Him under this &s;ublime and &s;triking Character, "the LORD of Ho&s;ts."</P>
<P>It is a Divine Appellation frequently occurring in Scripture, "The GOD of Ho&s;ts." (In the Hebrew, &s;ometimes ELOHI, &s;ometimes ADONAI, <HI>T&s;eba&ograve;th.</HI>) But here, and in &s;ome other Places; it is (JEHOVAH <HI>T&s;eba&ograve;th</HI>) "the LORD of Ho&s;ts."</P>
<P><HI>Jehovah</HI> is the appropriate Style of the &s;upreme Being; "the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t,&mdash;"which <HI>Three</HI> are <HI>One,</HI> the only "living and true God. And it imports his nece&s;&s;ary Exi&s;tence, and Self-exi&s;tence, his Self-&s;uffi|ciency, and All-&s;ufficiency, his Con&s;tancy and Immu|tability.

It intends much the &s;ame with that Title or Name, under which he revealed him&s;elf to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> I AM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some judge, we have a Name of our Saviour equivalent to this in the Greek Te&s;tament. One ob&s;erves, "That <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.5. &Ogr;'&OHgr;&Ngr;, &amp;c. may be rendered, <HI>The</HI> I AM, God over all,&mdash;by way of Appo&s;ition.</NOTE> (and, I AM THAT I AM) or that to <HI>John</HI> in the Revelation, "I am Alpha and Omega, the Be|ginning and the Ending, (the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t,) which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty." One who is Being it &s;elf, and has all Fulne&s;s of Being in Him&s;elf; a Being inderivative, independent, infinite, eternal, unchangeable, in his Nature and Perfections.&mdash;"His Name alone is JEHO|VAH." This Name, tho' common to the &s;everal Per&s;ons in the &s;acred Trinity, who all have the &s;ame common E&s;&s;ence, yet is not attributed to any other Being in the Univer&s;e. It is generally tran&s;lated by the Septuagint, &Kgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Sgr;, which, Criticks ob&s;erve, comes from ,&Kgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&OHgr;, that &s;ignify's, "I am."&mdash;The Word, JEHOVAH, is judged to be properly of ab&s;olute Signification; not in its primary Sen&s;e a Word of Re|lation, not a meer Title of Office, or Authority; but (as much as <HI>Man</HI> is) a Title of Nature, or E&s;&s;ence: and commonly &s;o u&s;ed.</P>
<P>But here it &s;eems to have a relative Application: JEHOVAH <HI>T&s;eba&ograve;th,</HI> tran&s;lated "The LORD of Ho&s;ts. The Name, u&s;ed in this Conjunction, &s;peaks God's &s;upreme Excellency and univer&s;al Dominion. He is "JEHOVAH of Ho&s;ts," or (in the Language of the New-Te&s;tament) "LORD of all,&mdash;"GOD, over all, ble&s;&s;ed for evermore." It teaches us his excellent Greatne&s;s. "His Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven."&mdash;And it teaches us his exten&s;ive Power and Rule. He &s;uperintends and governs all <HI>Ho&s;ts,</HI> whether of Heaven, Earth, or Hell.
<PB N="7" REF="007665_0008_102DBA94A5CD75B0">
They are all under his Feet, at his Command and Di&s;po&s;e; as well as inferior to Him in point of Na|ture and Properties.</P>
<P>This Word, <HI>T&s;eba&ograve;th,</HI> is retained in the Greek Te&s;tament, though according to the Idiom of that Tongue, it is read <HI>Saba&ograve;th.</HI> Nor have the Authors of our Engli&s;h Ver&s;ion &s;een fit to tran&s;late it; but give us the original Word in &s;everal Places. (<HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 29. and <HI>Jam.</HI> 5. 4.) In that Pa&s;&s;age quoted by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> from the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> what in the Hebrew is JEHOVAH <HI>T&s;eba&ograve;th,</HI> is in the Greek <HI>Kurios Saba&ograve;th;</HI> which, turned into Engli&s;h, is "The LORD of Ho&s;ts." It may &s;erve to correct a vulgar Mi&s;take, if I ob&s;erve that &s;ome of the Unlearned very corruptly read it <HI>Sabbath;</HI> and mi&s;s-under&s;tand the Places where they meet with it, as if "the Lord of <HI>Saba&ograve;th,</HI>" and "the Lord of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI>" were one and the &s;ame Title: whereas they are two Titles, of very different Mean|ing.&mdash;Several of the Fathers mi&s;took <HI>Saba&ograve;th</HI> for one of the Names of GOD: they &s;eem to have con&s;trued it as put in Appo&s;ition with <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or <HI>Lord.</HI> But were it a Name of God, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s have found it &s;ometimes u&s;ed alone by it &s;elf, as his other Names frequently are: Whereas, this Word is never &s;o apply'd to Him, but always in expre&s;s Conjunction with &s;ome one or other of his known Titles. And indeed Expo&s;itors, well under&s;tanding the Hebrew, in which Language the Word properly &s;ignifies "Ho&s;ts," or Bands of Soldiers, have u&s;ually tran&s;lated it, whether into Greek, or Latin, or other Tongue, by &s;ome Word of that Import. Tho' &s;ometimes, when mentioned in Relation to GOD, they have given it a lax Con&s;truction, and render'd it by the Word "Omnipotent," or Al|mighty. The Septuagint-Ver&s;ion retains the Letter of the Original in our Text: but in &s;everal other Places it u&s;es a Liberty, and turns the &s;ame Phra&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="007665_0009_102DBA96D0F500E0">
in this free Manner (&Kgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Sgr; &Pgr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Kgr;&Rgr;&Agr;&Tgr;&OHgr;&Rgr;) the "LORD Omnipotent."&mdash;Not that the <HI>Seventy</HI> took the Hebrew Word, TSEBA&Ograve;TH, properly to im|port a Name or Attribute of God: but they cho&s;e a free Tran&s;lation of it &s;ometimes; and that not unju&s;ti|fiably, &s;ince He who is called "the LORD of Ho&s;ts," indefinitely, and &s;o "the LORD of All," mu&s;t needs "be the Lord omnipotent," or "God almighty."&mdash;At other Times they render it, &Kgr;&Ugr;&Rgr;&Igr;&Ogr;&Sgr; &Tgr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Dgr;&Ugr;&Ngr;&Agr;&Mgr;&Egr;&OHgr;&Ngr;, <HI>Dominus Virtutum,</HI> "the LORD of the Powers:" meaning either his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every Power (or Perfection) in him&s;elf, and &s;o it &s;peaks the &s;uperlative Excellency of his Nature; or his governing all created Powers, and &s;o &s;peaks the Supremacy of his Domini|on:&mdash;which, in the Re&s;ult, come much to the &s;ame Thing. So that it is well expre&s;&s;ed in our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation, "The LORD of Ho&s;ts." This is the Name by which He is known, in Oppo&s;ition to fal&s;e Gods, and to Gods metaphorically &s;o called. <HI>Amos</HI> 5.27. "The LORD, who&s;e Name is the GOD of Ho&s;ts." "Even the LORD GOD of Ho&s;ts, the LORD is his Memorial." <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 12.&mdash;5. By this "we know, that the Lord is great, and that our LORD is above all Gods."</P>
<P>This de&s;criptive Appellation &s;peaks the ble&s;&s;ed GOD &s;upreme Monarch of the Univer&s;e, infinitely &s;uperiour to all &s;econd Cau&s;es, tran&s;cendent in Dignity and Maje&s;ty to all other Beings; having all Agents whatever, in univer&s;al Nature, under his re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Government, and at his ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al. It &s;eems to carry in it an Allu&s;ion to &s;ome powerful Captain-General, having va&s;t Armies under his Command, in|tirely &s;ubject to his Will, and di&s;po&s;ed, ordered, and managed as he plea&s;eth. GOD is truly the &s;overeign and univer&s;al Commander, having all Things in Subjection to Him, and all Events under his Conduct &amp; Controul, All Creatures, in all Worlds, "in the Heights above,
<PB N="9" REF="007665_0010_102DBA98824E4178">
and in the Depths below," belong to GOD's Ho&s;ts; and are, in their various Degrees and Ways, &s;ub&s;ervient to his Glory, as well as governed by his Providence.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance,</P>
<P>There is "the Ho&s;t of <HI>Heaven,</HI>" which we often read of in Scripture: and if by Heaven we under|&s;tand the World of Spirits, the upper and the invi&s;ible eternal World, called "the holy Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens," then by the Ho&s;t of Heaven are meant e&s;pecially the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, "the Princi|palities and Powers in heavenly Places." We are told of "the Armies of Heaven," among whom the great GOD doeth what&s;oever He plea&s;eth: and of a "Multitude of the heavenly Ho&s;t, prai&s;ing GOD," at the Birth of the holy Child JESUS: which means "an innumerable Company of Angels."&mdash;We read (1 Kin. 22. 19.) <HI>Micaiah</HI> &s;aid to the King of I&s;rael, "I &s;aw the LORD &s;itting on his Throne, and all the Ho&s;t of Heaven &s;tanding by Him." The&s;e mean "the Angels of Heaven," who are "mini&s;tring Spi|rits," ever waiting on the mo&s;t High, attending his Or|ders, and fulfilling his Will. Hence that of the royal Prophet (<HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103. 20, 21.) "Ble&s;s the LORD, ye his Angels, that excel in Strength, that do his Com|mandments, hearkning to the Voice of his Word. Ble&s;s ye the LORD, all ye his Ho&s;ts; ye Mini&s;ters of his, that do his Plea&s;ure."&mdash;The&s;e are they whom the LORD &s;pake of, when he an&s;wered <HI>Job</HI> out of the Whirl|wind, &s;aying, "The Morning-Stars &s;ang together; and all the Sons of God &s;houted for Joy," at his laying the Foundations of the Earth.&mdash;And of "the Angels of Light" e&s;pecially we are to under&s;tand that in the <HI>Levites</HI> Prayer (<HI>Neh.</HI> 9. 6.) "Thou, even thou art LORD alone; thou ha&s;t made Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens, with all their Ho&s;t:&mdash;and the Ho&s;t of Hea|ven wor&s;hippeth Thee."&mdash;Though, it is not to be un|der&s;tood
<PB N="10" REF="007665_0011_102DBA9AEA8AD6B0">
exclu&s;ively of "the Spirits of ju&s;t <HI>Men,</HI>" re|ceived up into Glory. For the&s;e al&s;o belong to "the heavenly Ho&s;t, and are continually "wor&s;hipping Him that liveth for ever and ever." The&s;e are a Multitude, that no Man can number." And all are &s;till in Subjection to "the Father of Spirits," he Rector of human Souls, and Lord of Angels. Both Species may be comprehended in <HI>Enoch'</HI>s Prophecy: "Behold, the LORD cometh with ten Thou&s;ands of his Saints, to execute Judgment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if by Heaven we under&s;tand the lower Heaven, the vi&s;ible Region of the Skie, "the Firmament of his Power," then by the Ho&s;t of Heaven are meant more immediately the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Stars.</HI> The&s;e &s;eem e&s;pecially intended where we read of Men's "wor&s;hip|ping the Ho&s;t of Heaven," an Idolatry of ancient Date, and of univer&s;al Practice in the heathen World. Hence that Caution to the I&s;raelites, who having the Example &s;o near them, were in Danger of getting a Snare to their Soul, by learning the Way of the World: <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 15, &amp;c. <Q>Take ye good Heed unto your &s;elves, le&s;t ye corrupt your &s;elves, and make you a graven Image,&mdash;and le&s;t thou lift up thine Eyes unto Heaven, and when thou &s;ee&s;t the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Ho&s;t of Heaven, &s;hould&s;t be driven to wor&s;hip them.</Q>&mdash;The cele&s;tial Bodies are in the Number of JEHOVAH's Ho&s;ts; not to be wor&s;hipped, but to &s;erve him, and to lead Men up to the Wor&s;hip of Him, their Creator and Lord. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 148. <Q>Prai&s;e ye the LORD. Prai&s;e ye the LORD from the Heavens: Prai&s;e Him in the Heights.&mdash;Prai&s;e ye him, all his Ho&s;ts. Prai&s;e ye him, Sun and Moon: Prai&s;e him, all ye Stars of Light.&mdash;Let them prai&s;e the Name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.</Q>&mdash;It was he, that "made great Lights, the Sun to rule
<PB N="11" REF="007665_0012_102DBA9E77D44068">
by Day, and the Moon and Stars to rule by Night." He "by his Wi&s;dom &s;tretched out the Heavens:" He "prepared the Light and the Sun; and the Moon and Stars hath He ordained."&mdash;He "appointeth the Moon for Sea&s;ons:" and by his Con&s;titution and Pro|vidence, "the Sun knoweth his going down. He cau|&s;eth "the Day-&s;pring to know his Place. "He telleth the Number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names.&mdash;"They continue this Day according to his Ordinances: for all are his Servants." He maintains them in their Being, Situation, Motion, Operation &amp; In|fluence: and all, in their Place, do his Will. They mini|&s;ter to the De&s;igns of Goodne&s;s, and of Ju&s;tice, in his Government of the moral World, and contribute much to the Advancement of his Glory. They even "&s;tand &s;till," at his bidding, and when it will &s;erve his Ends. So, the "Sun &s;tay'd in the mid&s;t of Heaven, over <HI>Gi|beon,</HI> and the Moon over the Valley of <HI>Ajalon,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> when the LORD fought for I&s;rael, until the People had avenged them&s;elves on their Enemies." And we read in the Song of <HI>Deborah,</HI> "They fought from Heaven, the Stars in their Cour&s;es fought again&s;t <HI>Si&s;era.</HI></P>
<P>But, to de&s;cend now to the lowe&s;t Territories of Heaven, the <HI>Meteors</HI> of the Air belong al&s;o to the Ho&s;t of GOD. "He createth the Wind, and bring|eth it out of his Trea&s;uries. "The Lord hath his Way in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Du&s;t of his Feet. "He cau&s;eth the Vapours to a&s;cend; He covereth the Heaven with Clouds, and they are turned about by his Coun&s;el.&mdash;He prepareth the Dew &amp; Rain for the Earth, and "water|eth the Hills from his Chambers. He is the Father of the Rain, and &s;endeth it where, and when, and in what Mea&s;ure he plea&s;eth. "He cau&s;eth it to come, whether for Correction, or in Mercy.&mdash;He al&s;o "thun|dereth
<PB N="12" REF="007665_0013_102DBA9FF9C79C58">
with the Voice of his Excellency, and &s;catter|eth his Lightnings, like Arrows.&mdash;He produces and commands "the Trea&s;ures of the Snow, and the Trea&s;ures of the Hail; which he re&s;erveth again&s;t the Time of Trouble, again&s;t the Day of Battle and War.&mdash;"He &s;cattereth the Hoar-fro&s;t: He ca&s;teth forth his Ice. Who can &s;tand before his Cold?&mdash;The Cold is his; and &s;o the Heat: they ri&s;e to what Degree, and in what Place, he plea&s;eth: According to his Covenant with <HI>Noah,</HI> they cea&s;e not to this Day, and by them He &s;mites whom He will, with their pinching or &s;corching Powers.&mdash;He "maketh Win|ter and Summer," and orders all the varying Occur|rences and Events of both. "He &s;endeth forth his Commandment," and they obey. He faith to one, Go; and it goeth: and to another, Come; and it cometh. "Fire, and Hail, Snow, and Vapour, and &s;tormy Wind, all fulfil his Word.&mdash;And I may properly enough add here; The living Creatures in the Air, "the Fowls of the Heaven," the&s;e al&s;o are under his Rule, and execute his Will. They are to be reckoned among "the Armies of Heaven": and when "the Lord uttereth his Voice before this his Army, his Camp is very great," and he appears "&s;trong to exe|cute his Word," whether by "Birds of Prey," or by "Swarms of Flies," &s;uch as we read of among the Plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which God &s;ent "to the End they might know, that He is the LORD in the mid&s;t of the Earth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all the&s;e, GOD hath his <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Ho&s;t. The Earth hath its Ho&s;t, as well as the Heavens. Hence we read in <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s Hi&s;tory of the Creation, "Thus the Heavens and the Earth were fini&s;hed, and all the Ho&s;t of them." By the Earth here is to be under&s;tood the whole Terraqueous Globe, including both Sea and Land. Now, "the Sea is his; for he

made it: and his Hands formed the dry Land.&mdash;"The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulne&s;s thereof; the World, and they that dwell therein. For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it upon the Floods.&mdash;"He created the Earth, and all Things that are therein; the Sea, and all that therein is: and he pre&s;erveth them all." They are his Work, his Care, and apply'd to his U&s;e, as he &s;ees fit, from Age to Age. "He doth what&s;oever he plea&s;eth in Heaven, and Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep Places.&mdash;"In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth; the Strength of the Hills is his al&s;o.&mdash;"He ruleth the raging of the Seas;" and rai&s;eth or &s;tilleth the Waves thereof. "The Earth is full of his Riches, &s;o is this great and wide Sea, wherein are Things creeping innumerable, both great and &s;mall. There go the <HI>Ships:</HI> and there is that <HI>Leviathan,</HI> whom he hath made to play therein. The&s;e all wait on him." The Ships that (richly laden) pa&s;s thro' the Paths of the Ocean, and all the living Creatures, that inhabit the watry Element, are under his ab&s;olute Government, Direction, and Controul. So are all the numberle&s;s Species of Animals, that co|ver the Face of the Earth. The Bea&s;ts of the Field, as well as Fi&s;hes of the Sea, and even the Worms of the Du&s;t, as well as Birds of the Air, &s;en&s;itive Crea|tures of every Kind, which &s;warm in all Parts of the Univer&s;e, they univer&s;ally belong to GOD's Armies, and he employs them to what Purpo&s;es he plea&s;eth, in the Kingdom of Providence. Any of the&s;e appear to Men a formidable Ho&s;t, when God commi&s;&s;ions and arms them to de&s;troy. "The Adder in the Path, "the Boar out of the Wood, "the Bear by the Way, "the Lion in the Wilderne&s;s, &amp;c. are a Terror to Mankind; much more, Troops of them collected together. It is therefore remarked, as an aggravating Circum&s;tance of our Saviour's Temptation in the Wilderne&s;s, "He

was with the wild Bea&s;ts."&mdash;But they are all in Sub|jection to the great LORD of the Univer&s;e. "The wild Bea&s;ts of the Field (&s;ays he) are mine: every Bea&s;t of the Fore&s;t is mine, and the Cattle on a thou&s;and Hills.&mdash;"The Eyes of all wait upon him. "He giveth to the Bea&s;t his Food."&mdash;And therefore claims his Service. "Prai&s;e the LORD from the Earth, ye Dragons,&mdash;Bea&s;ts, and all Cattle, creep|ing Things, and flying Fowl.&mdash;"Let every Thing that hath Breath prai&s;e the LORD.&mdash;They are all among the Ho&s;ts, of which GOD is the LORD. Having mentioned "Heaven and Earth," as the Sum of the Univer&s;e, he &s;ays (I&s;ai. 45. 12.) "ALL their Ho&s;t have I commanded.&mdash;Nor are we to overlook Things inanimate, the Trees of the Wood, the Herbs of the Field, the Minerals of the Ground, Trea&s;ures hid in the Sand, &amp;c. the&s;e al&s;o are to be numbred a|mong the LORD's Ho&s;ts: and by them he executes his Plea&s;ure, whether in Judgment, or in Mercy.</P>
<P>But among the numerous Ho&s;ts in this inferiour Creation, <HI>Mankind</HI> bear a di&s;tingui&s;hing Figure. And when God is &s;tiled "the LORD of Ho&s;ts," it &s;ome|times more immediately refers to the intellectual Part of the World, who are united in various Communi|ties, Kingdoms, Provinces, Towns, Families, &amp;c. of all which GOD is the &s;upream Head, Former, Pre&s;er|ver, and Ruler. "He created Man upon Earth.&mdash;"He hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the Face of the Earth. He deter|mineth the Times fore-appointed, and the Bounds of their Habitation.&mdash;"He ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,&mdash;and is "the Governour among the Nations:"&mdash;pre&s;iding over all Societies and Per&s;ons; ruling the Spirits, as well as the Bodies of Men, and ordering all the Incidents of human Life.&mdash;If we &s;peak of publick Calamities, tho&s;e "three &s;ore Evils, Pe&s;tilence, Fa|mine,

and Sword," are the grand Artillery of Heaven, the Judgments of GOD's Hand, which he &s;endeth to pu|ni&s;h a &s;inful People. In particular, the Sword is his: and he &s;heaths or un&s;heaths it, as he plea&s;es. He "mu&s;tereth the Ho&s;t of the Battle," and &s;ucceeds, or defeats, at his Plea&s;ure. The Events of War are at his ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;e. "The Victory is his," on whatever Side it turns. He is "the LORD of Ho&s;ts,&mdash;"the GOD of Armies,&mdash;in the literal, military Sen&s;e.&mdash;More e&s;pecially is he "the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,"</HI> LORD of the Church, the religious A&s;&s;emblies of his People, which are &s;ometimes figuratively called his Ho&s;ts. He only is the Object of Wor&s;hip, and he has the &s;ole Right of Empire over his People in the Matters of Divine Wor&s;hip. He is the &s;ole Lord of Con&s;cience; and he only has "Dominion over our Faith."&mdash;It is written, "Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.&mdash;"Wor&s;hip him, all ye Gods.&mdash;Kings of the Earth, and all People; Princes, and all Judges of the Earth; both Young Men and Maidens, Old Men and Children: let them prai&s;e the Name of the LORD: for his Name alone is excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven.</P>
<P>But to add one Remark further,</P>
<P>Even the <HI>infernal</HI> Ho&s;t is under a Divine Re&s;triction and Providential Government. "The Angels that &s;inned," were immediately "ca&s;t into Hell, and clapt in Chains of Darkne&s;s," even "everla&s;ting Chains." The&s;e, altho' in a Sen&s;e &s;ometimes &s;aid to be "loo&s;ed out of their Pri&s;on," and the Devil compared to "a roaring Lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour," yet are always under Check. "The Devil and his Angels, with all their confederate Forces, Sinners on Earth, and lo&s;t Souls in Hell,&mdash;the whole "Power of Dark|ne&s;s," have a Divine Re&s;traint upon them: and the glorious GOD, by his infinitely &s;uperiour Wi&s;dom and

He de&s;erves and claims our highe&s;t Homage, the &s;upreme Love of our Hearts, and intire Service of our Lives. GOD is worthy, and makes the Demand, that a Re&s;pect to him &s;hould be our reigning Principle, his Will our governing Rule, and his Glory our predominant End. This is of moral Obligation upon us.&mdash;But alas, we are in a fallen State, and can never ri&s;e up to the Perfection of moral Duty, becoming the Maje&s;ty and Holine&s;s of him "with whom we have to do." Nor can we hope to do him acceptable Service, without previous Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Mediator of the New Covenant, the Propitiation for our Sins, and our Advo|cate with the Father. With what Humility does it become Sinners to approach the Maje&s;ty of Heaven? And what Care to make u&s;e of the Mediation of Chri&s;t? Always "coming to God by him; and what&s;oever we do, in Word or Deed, doing all in his Name," with a believing Eye to the Merits and Interce&s;&s;ion of the Lamb of God: And indeed "calling on the Name of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>" paying him all the Ho|mage,

Thus, "honouring the SON, even as we honour the FATHER," both being ONE, with Re|&s;pect to Union in "eternal Power and Godhead;" for which Rea&s;on, we are a&s;&s;ured, "He that &s;o honour|eth not the SON, neither honoureth he the FATHER him&s;elf.&mdash;There is "one GOD, even the Father," and there is al&s;o "one LORD," even the Son.

But, to add another Reflection,</P>
<P>This Divine Character, "the LORD of Ho&s;ts," ad|mini&s;ters abundant <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> &amp; <HI>Encouragement</HI> to all &s;incere Believers &amp; true Wor&s;hippers of God. Surely it is your Safety, Intere&s;t and Honour, and therefore your Wi&s;dom, my Friends, that you are engaged in the Ser|vice of him who is "the LORD of Ho&s;ts;" a Name "great in <HI>Zion,</HI>" and &s;uch as &s;peaks him your mo&s;t rightful Proprietor, King, and Judge, and all-&s;ufficient Saviour. It is your happy Privilege, that he "who&s;e you are and whom you &s;erve," is "able to do for you exceeding abundantly above all that you a&s;k or think." Verily, the LORD of Ho&s;ts is on your Side: and &s;ince HE is <HI>for</HI> you, who or what &s;hall be <HI>again&s;t</HI> you? Nay, being in Friend&s;hip with him, you are al&s;o in League with all his <HI>Ho&s;ts</HI> in Heaven and Earth; nor &s;hall the Ho&s;t of <HI>Hell</HI> it &s;elf, however they may hate and di&s;tre&s;s you, be able finally to "prevail a|gain&s;t you": much le&s;s need you "fear what <HI>Man</HI> can do unto you."&mdash;O follow "the Captain of your Sal|vation"; and he will in the End bring you &s;afe to Glory, by the Conduct of his almighty SPIRIT. Yea, he "maketh his <HI>Angels</HI> mini&s;tring Spirits;" and they "encamp round about them that fear GOD," and who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation.&mdash;Even all his mighty Ho&s;ts, cele&s;tial and terre&s;trial, &s;hall &s;ide with you a|gain&s;t the infernal Ho&s;t, and con&s;pire to promote your eternal Safety and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. The Hills may be level'd with the Valleys, and Mountains be removed, and &s;ink in the mighty Waters: yea, Earth and Hea|ven may pa&s;s away: but you being "joined to the LORD in an everla&s;ting Covenant," the Promi&s;e is &s;ure, from his Power and Faithfulne&s;s, that "all Things &s;hall work together for Good to you." You being CHRIST's behold, "All Things are yours, and &s;hall turn to your Salvation." The mo&s;t violent Gu&s;ts of

Though "God cometh out of his Place to puni&s;h the Inhabitants of the Earth," though "he maketh of a City an Heap; of a defenced City, a Ruin;" though "all Joy is dark|ned, the Mirth of the Land is gone, and all the Merry-hearted do &s;igh": yet "the LORD will ordain Peace for you", whether exempted from the common Cala|mity, or not. And con&s;cious of having &s;ecured an In|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t by Faith, you may glory in the LORD, and &s;ay in that Day, "Lo, this is our GOD; we have waited for him, and he will &s;ave us: this is the LORD, we have waited for him, and we will re|joyce in his Salvation." Though even univer&s;al Nature were all in a Combu&s;tion, though the Heavens were blazing over your Heads, the Earth burning under your Feet, and all the Ho&s;ts of both &s;eemingly arming for your De&s;truction; yet are you &s;afe, perfectly &s;afe, in the Hands of him who is "the LORD of Ho&s;ts;" nor need be di&s;mayed, in the lea&s;t, even at the Terror of a di&s;&s;olving World.&mdash;<HI>You</HI> I mean, who are among

<P>But "the <HI>Ungodly</HI> are not &s;o."

Surely, "the LORD is great; and greatly to be feared." With the LORD of Ho&s;ts is terrible Maje&s;ty, and irre&s;i&s;tible Power. "Our GOD is a con&s;uming Fire.&mdash;"Who &s;hall not fear him!" Shall not "<HI>Man,</HI> that is a Worm," con&s;ider and be "afraid of him!" Much more <HI>&s;inful</HI> Man, that is odious to his Holine&s;s, and obnoxious to his revenging Ju&s;tice! Oh, "who can &s;tand before this holy LORD GOD, when once he is angry! or, whither can you flee from his Pre&s;ence!&mdash;"His Eyes behold the Nations;" his Eyes, that are "as a Flame of Fire," penetrate the darke&s;t, and reach the mo&s;t di&s;tant Rece&s;&s;es; "his Hand &s;hall find out all his Enemies:" and he hath his powerful Ho&s;ts every where, prepared to "fight the Battles of the LORD"; by the very lea&s;t of which he can bring you low, yea, de&s;troy you in a Moment. Should the LORD commi&s;&s;ion his Ho&s;ts to make War again&s;t you, for your De&s;truction, how weak will be your Re&s;i&s;t|ance, and how certain your Ruine? Should a righ|teous GOD bid "the Decree bring forth," and call to the Mini&s;ters of his Vengeance to do their Office, you may look that "the Heaven &s;hall reveal your Iniquity, and the Earth ri&s;e up again&s;t you." And Hell gapes to receive your guilty Soul. The Ho&s;ts of the LORD, every one of them, from an Angel to an In&s;ect, wait his Commands, and ever &s;tand ready to

They are above and beneath you, they are before and be|hind, on your right Hand and on your left, yea, even within, as well as without you. There is no re&s;i&s;ting, nor e&s;caping, if the LORD of <HI>Ho&s;ts</HI> empower and arm and &s;end them again&s;t you. Will you not then "trem|ble for Fear of him?

"Acquaint your &s;elves now with him, and be at Peace; thereby Good &s;hall come unto you." Get reconciled to God in Chri&s;t, fear and love, and &s;erve him: &s;o you will be &s;ecured of his powerful Friend&s;hip, and the Friend&s;hip of all his Ho&s;ts. But, continuing impenitent Rebels&punc; what remains for you, but "a fiery Indignation, that &s;hall devour the Adver&s;aries?&mdash;Certainly, "dying in your Sins," you will "fall into the Hands of the liv|ing God," under the Revenges of his unappea&s;able Ju&s;tice: and then all the Ho&s;ts of the Lord will join in pouring Indignation and Contempt upon you.&mdash;Even in the pre&s;ent World, awful Judgments await you. For "God is angry with the Wicked every Day." And if he &s;hould ari&s;e, and whet his Sword, and come to deal with you in his hot Di&s;plea&s;ure, "could your Heart undure, or your Hands be &s;trong!" Oh, "whither will you flee for Help in that Day? And, where will you leave your Glory?"&mdash;How will you defend your &s;elves again&s;t the Wrath of Almighty GOD? Or, how will you be "able to abide in the Day of his fierce Anger?" Before it be too late, "con&s;ider this, ye that forget GOD, le&s;t he tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver!" O con&s;ider "what you will do in the Time of Vi&s;itation:" or rather inquire now, "what you mu&s;t do to be &s;aved," even with an everla&s;ting Salvation!&mdash;And ha&s;ten the Flight of Faith to|wards

<P>This is a figurative Expre&s;&s;ion, frequent in Scrip|ture-U&s;e.

When God fulfils his Promi&s;es, or his Threatnings, in &s;ending Good, or Evil, he is &s;aid to vi&s;it us.</P>

Prayers of Faith.&mdash;When <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> lay on his Death-bed, he a&s;&s;ured his Brethren, by the Spirit of Prophecy, that "GOD would vi&s;it them, and bring them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of that Land." Accordingly, when GOD rai&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for a Deliverer, and &s;ent him to the I&s;raelites, he &s;aluted them with a con&s;olatory Me&s;&s;age in tho&s;e Terms, "The GOD of your Fathers hath appeared unto me, &s;aying, I have &s;urely vi&s;ited you." And of the People, believing the glad Report, it is &s;aid, "When they heard that the LORD had vi&s;ited the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and that he had looked upon their Affliction, they bowed their Heads and wor&s;hipped." This was a Vi&s;itation for Good, in Mercy and in Truth.&mdash;So with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Jews</HI> Re&s;toration from their Captivity in <HI>Babylon,</HI> GOD is &s;aid to "vi&s;it them, and perform his good Word towards them".&mdash;The&s;e Providential Vi&s;itations were <HI>Typical</HI> of that more abundantly gracious Vi&s;itation, which GOD made to his People, in the Fulne&s;s of Time, by his Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the great Saviour, "worthy of more Glory than <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI>" Even the fame which that godly Prie&s;t <HI>Zacharias</HI> celebrated in his Song of Prai&s;e. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD GOD of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> for he hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his People; and hath rai&s;ed up an Horn of Salvation for us." This is what the royal P&s;almi&s;t, if interpreted by the Apo&s;tle, &s;eems to have had principally in his Eye, where he &s;ays, "What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? and the Son of Man, that thou <HI>vi&s;ite&s;t</HI> him?"

<P>I thought it not unmeet to premi&s;e the Mention of the&s;e Vi&s;itations for Good, and in Mercy, though not intended in the Text: And &s;urely wherein we have been "vi&s;ited of the LORD of Ho&s;ts," in this bene|ficial Sen&s;e, we &s;hould take a thankful and admiring Notice of the gracious Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Kindne&s;s of GOD to us.&mdash;We &s;hould pray for &s;uch Divine Vi&s;i|tations, whether of a temporal, or a &s;piritual Refe|rence. "Remember me, O LORD, with the Favour thou beare&s;t to thy People: O vi&s;it me with thy Sal|vation; that I may &s;ee the Good of thy Cho&s;en."&mdash;And we &s;hould be concerned, that we may "glorify GOD in the Day of Vi&s;itation", in every &s;uch Day, when vi&s;ited with <HI>Good,</HI> in any In&s;tance, and of what|ever Kind.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e there are other Vi&s;itations, that are in a Way of <HI>Judgment:</HI> and the&s;e are directly pointed to in our Text.&mdash;The Scripture &s;peaks el&s;e|where expre&s;ly and abundantly of a being "vi&s;ited with <HI>Evil.</HI>" In this Sen&s;e we are to under&s;tand tho&s;e general Expre&s;&s;ions: "Shall not I vi&s;it for the&s;e Things? &s;aith the LORD.&mdash;"This is the City to to be vi&s;ited. Agreably we read, "I will bring Evil upon them, even the Year of their Vi&s;itation.&mdash;And again, "What will ye do in the Day of Vi&s;itation, and in the De&s;olation that &s;hall come from far?&mdash;We read of God's "vi&s;it|ing Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the Rod:&mdash;and vi&s;iting in his Anger.&mdash;There are judicial and penal, di&s;ciplinary and angry Vi&s;itations, as well as gracious and beneficent.

"Thou ha&s;t vi&s;ited and de&s;troyed them."&mdash;The&s;e Vi|&s;itations are the Matter of many Divine <HI>Threatnings.</HI> "Now will he remember their Iniquity, and vi&s;it their Sins: they &s;hall return to <HI>Egypt,</HI>" their ancient Hou&s;e of Bondage.&mdash;"They &s;hall fall, among them that fall: in the Time of their Vi&s;itation they &s;hall be ca&s;t down, &s;aith the LORD.&mdash;And again, "In the Time of their Vi&s;itation they &s;hall peri&s;h.&mdash;Accordingly our engli&s;h Tran&s;lators &s;ometimes cho&s;e to depart from a literal Ver&s;ion of the Word, and only give the Sen&s;e.

The&s;e Vi&s;itations, in a Way of Anger and Puni&s;h|ment, are fearful Vi&s;itations, and to be deprecated by us: yet certainly to be looked for, as they are ju&s;tly de&s;erved, if we "provoke the Lord to Jealou&s;y," by "going on &s;till in our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es," notwith&s;tanding Divine Warnings and Reproofs, and by "de&s;pi&s;ing the Riches of his Goodne&s;s and Long&s;uffering to|wards us.</P>

This is called "our vi&s;iting him, in the Time of Trouble.&mdash;He certainly expects this Return from us. And thus the End of his corrective Vi&s;itations being an&s;wered, we may hope, that he will not proceed in a Way of Controver&s;y with us; or at lea&s;t, that he "will not make a full End of us, but correct us in Mea&s;ure," and forbear to pour out all his Wrath.&mdash;If we do indeed "return to the mo&s;t High," and "vi&s;it him," in the Name of the ble&s;&s;ed Mediator, with our penitential Confe&s;&s;ions, and our believing Prayers, following the &s;ame with "Fruits wor|thy of Repentance," and "&s;hewing our Faith by our Works," we may humbly hope, that he will "ari&s;e for our Help, and &s;hew us his Mercy;" that he will "vi&s;it us with his Salvation," and "not rebuke us in his &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

III. I am to &s;peak of God's vi&s;iting us with the <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>Among the various Articles enumerated in our Text, this is one. "Thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited of the LORD of Ho&s;ts with <HI>Earthquake and great Noi&s;e.</HI>&mdash;What the <HI>Earthquake</HI> means, and what the <HI>great Noi&s;e</HI> attending it, none of you who have &s;o lately felt the one, and heard the other, can want any De|&s;cription. All therefore I &s;hall do here, is briefly to a&s;&s;ert a <HI>Divine Agency</HI> in this Event; and then con|&s;ider it under the Idea of a Divine <HI>Vi&s;itation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Earthquake is undoubtedly one of the won|drous <HI>Works</HI> of the LORD of Ho&s;ts.&mdash;He that ori|ginally gave Being to the Earth, al&s;o gives Birth to the Events that happen therein. He is "the Creator of all the Ends of the Earth." He laid the Founda|tion of it, in the Beginning, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it by his Wi&s;dom and Might. He projected and executed the primitive Plan of its Form, its Compo&s;ition, its Place in the Creation, its Powers, Motions, Productions, and Effects: and in all he &s;upports, pre&s;erves, and governs it to this Day. He hath given it &s;uch a Proportion of Magnitude, &s;o equally poi&s;ed it on every Side, &s;o adju&s;ted all its relative Circum&s;tances, &s;o contempered all its various internal Contents, and made every Thing therein "in Number, Weight and Mea&s;ure," in &s;uch Harmony, Con&s;i&s;tency, and Regularity, with &s;uch Aptitude and Inclination to the &s;everal Ends and U&s;es they were de&s;igned for, and with &s;uch powerful Tendencies to the Good of the Whole: that we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, the Earth would never have experienced &s;uch Di&s;orders, nor &s;uffered &s;uch Convul&s;ions, as it doth, had it not been for the Sin of Man; and were it not for the &s;pecial Inter|po&s;itions of a DIVINE AGENT, who&s;e over-ruling

Hand, and &s;overeign (all-controuling, but uncontroul|able) Dominion extends to the whole Sy&s;tem of Nature.</P>
<P>What &s;aith the Scripture? "In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth;" &s;ubterraneous Caverns, and whatever pa&s;&s;es in them, all at his ab&s;olute Di&s;|po&s;e: "The Strength of the Hills is his al&s;o;" their Magnitude, Altitude, Con&s;i&s;tence, and Influence, given or taken away by him, at his Plea&s;ure. "The Sea is his," and "He treadeth on the Waves of the Sea." He hath "appointed the Sands for the Bound thereof." He governs it in all it's Motions, Fluxes and Refluxes, and the various Con&s;equences thereof&punc; He retains it within it's de&s;tin'd Limits, or cau&s;es it to break over its Boundaries, in terrible Inundations, where and when he plea&s;eth. "And his Hands form|ed the dry Land;" which gives him therefore a Right of Propriety in it, and of Dominion over it; and over all Things either upon the Surface, or within the Bowels of it.&mdash;"The Earth is the LORD's, and the Fulne&s;s thereof." And whatever Revolutions or Vici&s;|&s;itudes happen <HI>on</HI> it, or <HI>in</HI> it, he pre&s;ides, and governs all. The <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of the Earth is his: all its Produce, all its Incumbents, all it's Contents, at his ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al; and he adds, or dimini&s;hes, as he plea&s;eth, and with a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Power moderates in all terrene Affairs. The <HI>Earth</HI> it&s;elf is the LORD's. He "form'd it to be inhabited," by whom, and in what Parts he plea&s;eth: and as he has an indi&s;putable Right, where he will, to "make it a Land de&s;olate and not in|habited," &s;o whenever this Event happens, and where-ever, or by whatever Means, a Divine Agency is to be &s;een and owned therein. "Lo; he that formeth the Mountains, and treadeth upon the high Places of the Earth; the LORD, the GOD of Ho&s;ts is his Name:" and at his Plea&s;ure, he converts them into Valleys, or &s;inks them in the Ocean; or only threatens

their Overthrow, by a mighty Tremor and Convul&s;ion. Be the Force and Effects of an Earthquake in one De|gree or another, we are ever taught to a&s;cribe it to GOD. Sometimes "He removeth the Mountains," and is &s;aid to "&s;hake the Earth out of its Place:" but if only "the Pillars thereof tremble," if the per|petual Hills bow, tho' they be not &s;cattered, it is &s;till the Operation of his almighty Hand. In every &s;uch Ca&s;e, we mu&s;t make the P&s;almi&s;t's devout Confe&s;&s;ion, "THOU ha&s;t made the Earth to tremble;" even al|tho' we have no Occa&s;ion to add his Complaint, "Thou ha&s;t broken it; heal the Breaches thereof."&mdash;Though it be &s;aid in the Story of God's Appearances to the Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> that "the LORD was not in the <HI>Earthquake,</HI>" this is by no Means to be under&s;tood as if God were not the Author of it, but only that here|by he made no &s;pecial Di&s;coveries of his Mind and Will to the Prophet.</P>
<P>There may have been Earthquakes purely miraculous, and &s;upernatural; not owing to any natural Cau&s;es, at lea&s;t in their natural Cour&s;e of Operation. As, that in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Elijah:</HI> And that at the Promulgation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when "GOD came down on <HI>Si|nai,</HI> and the whole Mount quaked exceedingly." So that in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Corah:</HI> And tho&s;e which accom|panied our LORD's Death and Re&s;urrection: So, that which "&s;hook open the Pri&s;on-Doors," in the Story of the Jaylor: And perhaps that miraculous Event on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> was the Earthquake and great Noi&s;e. "Suddenly (it is &s;aid) there came a Sound from Heaven, as of a mighty ru&s;hing Wind, and it filled the Hou&s;e;" filled it with Noi&s;e and Tremor, at lea&s;t: in which the Apo&s;tle notices the Fulfilment of ancient Prophecy: "I will &s;hew Won|ders in Heaven above, and Signs in the Earth beneath.</P>

But, without Que&s;tion, u&s;ually the Earthquake, though a rare and &s;urpri&s;ing Phaenomenon (and never yet fully accounted for, on any Hypothe&s;is) happens agreably to the Laws of Nature, and has its imme|diate Origin from Cau&s;es natural: very much the &s;ame perhaps with tho&s;e that give Ri&s;e to Thunder.&mdash;But the Inve&s;tigation of the&s;e is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Philo&s;ophy, and the Controver&s;ies on this Head may well enough be left to "the Di&s;puters of this World.</P>
<P>Theology points us to GOD, as the fir&s;t Cau&s;e. Whatever be the &s;econdary Cau&s;es, and Rea&s;ons in Nature, without Controver&s;y "the LORD of Ho&s;ts" is the grand Operator, the prime Efficient. Being the Creator and Proprietor of the univer&s;al World, the Author and Pre&s;erver of all natural Cau&s;es, and of all their Virtues, In&s;tincts, and Principles of Operation; He has an indi&s;putable Claim to Government over them, and exerci&s;es his &s;overeign Right (as before ob&s;erved) in guiding, influencing, limiting, and over-ruling them, according to the Coun&s;el of his own Will, in Sub&s;erviency to the De&s;igns of his Providence. Indeed &s;uch are the &s;trange Appearances &s;ometimes in the natural World, that it looks as if Nature had then broke loo&s;e from all Law and Order, and natural Agents were left to act at Random, with a wild Rage and unbounded Licen&s;e. But the Truth is, amid&s;t all their Impetuo&s;ity, mutual Contrariety, and Confu&s;ion, they are "not without Law to God," but &s;till are re|&s;trained and governed by his almighty Hand, and "ful|fil his Word." Not an Earthquake happens, whether great or &s;mall, and whatever its natural Cau&s;es or Effects, but GOD is the &s;upreme Author. It is pri|marily the Work of him who is the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</P>

Truly, whenever this is a Con&s;equence of the Earth|quake, it is, however for Correction, yet in Mercy. Though a terrible Vi&s;itation, yet is it a merciful one in the Event, when &s;anctify'd of God for &s;aving Ad|vantage to Souls; e&s;pecially when con&s;iderable Num|bers are the happy Subjects of good Impre&s;&s;ions, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on. A gracious Vi&s;itation by the HOLY SPIRIT, attending this Vi&s;itation in Providence, how|ever grievous and tremendous for the pre&s;ent, turns it into a beneficial one, and joyous, in the Reflection. Yea, though it prove the De&s;truction of many Lives, yet if "the Remnant are affrighted, and give Glory to the GOD of Heaven," by making a wi&s;e U&s;e of &s;uch a bereaving and de&s;olating Vi&s;itation, to the Ends of Religion, and the &s;aving of the Soul, it is to them eventually a Vi&s;itation in Mercy, and for their be&s;t Good.</P>
<P>It remains to ob&s;erve, more directly to the Purpo&s;e of our Text,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Earthquake is mo&s;t commonly a Vi&s;itation in holy <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> at a People, for their <HI>Sins.</HI></P>
<P>The Earthquake u&s;ually carry's the Face of an <HI>angry</HI> Vi&s;itation, procured by <HI>Sin.</HI> The fir&s;t Sin of Man, not only brought Wrath upon him&s;elf, and on his Offspring; but "&s;ubjected the Creature to Vanity," and entailed a "Cur&s;e upon the Ground:" which the accumulative Guilt of new Rebellions, among the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive Inhabitants of the Earth, provokes God to put in Execution from Age to Age. So outragious and ob&s;tinate was the Wickedne&s;s of the Generality even of <HI>Adam'</HI>s more immediate Po&s;terity, that "God re|pented he had made Man upon the Earth;" and ac|cordingly, by a terrible Execution of Ju&s;tice, the World that then was, being overflowed with Water, peri&s;hed." An univer&s;al and mo&s;t fatal <HI>Inundation!</HI> An Example of "Perdition of ungodly Men," not to be parallel'd,

but by the final <HI>Conflagration,</HI> which "the Earth that now is," we are a&s;&s;ured by Revelation, is "re&s;erved unto." Yet in the mean Time, particular Cities, or Countries, are not exempt from a &s;imilar Overthrow and De&s;olation: In&s;tances of which there have been many, both ancient and modern, and &s;ome very re|cent. As "GOD &s;pared not the old World," &s;o neither &s;pared he <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and other heathen Cities in the new World, in like Manner giv|ing them&s;elves over to Filthine&s;s, but "condemned them with an Overthrow, making them an En&s;ample of Vengeance, to them that after &s;hould live ungodly." Nor hath God &s;pared even his own profe&s;&s;ing People (whether Jews, or Chri&s;tians) when their Apo&s;tacy has ripen'd them for De&s;truction. Hence that of the Prophet <HI>Amos,</HI> &s;peaking to I&s;rael, in GOD's Name; "Some of you I have overthrown, as I overthrew <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah.</HI>" An expre&s;s Scripture-In|&s;tance of this we have in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Corah</HI> and his wicked Accomplices, who were partly de&s;troyed by Fire from Heaven, and partly &s;wallowed up by an Earthquake, in the Days of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI>&mdash;The Words of <HI>Amos,</HI> dated expre&s;ly "two Years before the Earth|quake," when he prophe&s;y'd, "that the Land &s;hould tremble," and that GOD would "&s;mite the Winter-Hou&s;e, with the Summer-Hou&s;e, and the great Hou&s;es &s;hould have an End; that he would "&s;mite the great Hou&s;e with Breaches, and the little Hou&s;e with Clefts; that "the Songs of the Temple &s;hould be Howlings in that Day, there being many dead Bodies in every&punc; Place," &amp;c. this Prophecy, it is thought, was fulfil'd in that memorable In&s;tance which the Prophet <HI>Zecha|riah</HI> refers to, where he takes Notice how the People "fled from before the Earthquake in the Days of <HI>Uzziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI>". Which, by this Hint, &s;eems to have been a great and terrible Earthquake, &s;ome|thing
<PB N="37" REF="007665_0038_102DBAD8D069C840">
like that which "all I&s;rael fled" from before, in the Wilderne&s;s. Perhaps the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> who was contemporary with <HI>Uzziah,</HI> refers to this &s;ame Event, which he might be an Eye-witne&s;s to in tho&s;e Words of his&punc; <Q>Becau&s;e they have de&s;pi&s;ed the Word of the Holy One of I&s;rael, therefore is the Anger of the LORD kindled again&s;t his People, and he hath &s;mitten them; and the Hills did tremble, and their Carca&s;es were torn in the mid&s;t of the Streets.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> the Jewi&s;h Antiquary &s;eems to confirm this Thought, when he informs us, from Tradition, of &s;uch Circum&s;tances attending this Earthquake; that "it rent the Roof of the Temple, and tore down a Moun|tain, which rolling along choak'd up the High-ways, and coverd the King's Gardens all over with Rubbi&s;h." It might then happen, according to the Prophecy of <HI>Amos,</HI> that there were "many dead Bodies;" or according to <HI>I&s;aiah'</HI>s Report, that "the Carca&s;es of Men were torn in the Streets." While they "fled from before the Earthquake," the falling Mountain might catch and cru&s;h them; the Rocks, thrown down and rolling along, might overtake and de&s;troy them; and many might peri&s;h by the Fall of the Hou&s;es, that were &s;hook down. This was a judicial Vi&s;itation: the Prophet expre&s;ly a&s;cribes it to "the Anger of the LORD kindled again&s;t his People; and" vi&s;iting their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions upon them.&mdash;The&s;e Scripture-Accounts teach us always to view it as an <HI>angry</HI> Vi&s;itation, for Sin, when the Earthquake is the Means of awful Deaths and Deva&s;tations, in whatever Part or Age of the World this happens. Such undoubtedly was that which the Jewi&s;h Antiquities acquaint us, fell out in the Reign of <HI>Herod</HI> (a little before Chri&s;t's Coming) when the whole Land was &s;haken in a mo&s;t amazing Manner, a Multitude of Hou&s;es thrown down, and &s;ome Thou&s;ands of the Inhabitants bury'd in the
<PB N="38" REF="007665_0039_102DBADB31D33FC0">
Ruins.&mdash;And &s;uch undoubtedly were the "Earthquakes in divers Places," that fell out according to our LORD's Prediction, not very long after his A&s;cen&s;ion, when (as Hi&s;tory informs us) &s;ome great and populous Cities, yea, Numbers of them at a Time, were overthrown and de&s;troyed: in which De&s;olations, not Pagans only, but Jews&punc; and Chri&s;tians too, many of them were in|volved.&mdash;And we have Rea&s;on to think, &s;uch al&s;o were tho&s;e in following Ages, which befel many Cities where Chri&s;tianity had once flouri&s;hed, but Apo&s;tacy having taken Place and prevailed, this proved their utter Ruin.</P>
<P>The Time would fail me, to tell of <HI>Antioch</HI> (the City fir&s;t honoured with the Name <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>) of <HI>Sar|dis,</HI> of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> &amp;c. (in the Number of the &s;even Churches in the <HI>Revelation;</HI> which have long &s;ince peri&s;hed by Earthquakes, that left them &s;carce any Mark or Memorial where they &s;tood) and of &s;everal Parts of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> (often vi&s;ited with Earthquakes, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t intirely de|moli&s;hed by them) and of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> (formerly a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> City, though now <HI>Mahometan;</HI> always &s;ubject to Earthquakes; a very terrible and de&s;tructive one befel it about two Years &s;ince) and of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with adjacent Places, (very lately, and mo&s;t dreadfully overthrown) and of <HI>Cadiz</HI> (another recent In&s;tance) with other Places, where Earthquakes and Inundati|ons have de&s;troyed much Sub&s;tance, and many Lives&punc; As al&s;o of Places in the <HI>American</HI> Parts of the World&punc; <HI>Antigua, Nevis, Jamaica, Lima,</HI> &amp;c. which have &s;ometimes been almo&s;t de&s;troyed by Earthquakes.&mdash;Nay, though we are not to judge the People of &s;uch Places to have been "Sinners above all Men", yet if the <HI>like Sins</HI> were abounding among them, as the Scrip|tures tell us were the procuring Cau&s;es of <HI>like De&s;o|lations</HI> in other Places of old, it is no Breach of Cha|rity,

to &s;uppo&s;e the Places I have mentioned, were "vi&s;ited of the LORD of Ho&s;ts," in this fearful Man|ner, for their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and have been "thrown down in his Anger.&mdash;"Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Na|tion: but Sin is the Reproach of any People." When "the Foundations of the Earth are moved exceed|ingly, when a Place "falls," and e&s;pecially if it "ri&s;es not again," it is a Sign "the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions thereof are heavy upon it," and a Token of "Wrath gone out from the LORD again&s;t it.&mdash;When "the Cur&s;e devour|eth the Earth," in particular Spots of it, and &s;preads De&s;olation among its Inhabitants, the Scripture teaches us to look on it as a Sign, that "the Earth is defiled under its Inhabitants, becau&s;e of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions," and that an angry Providence has "vi&s;ited for the&s;e Things.&mdash;As it is written, "Who hath harden'd him|&s;elf again&s;t GOD, and hath pro&s;pered? Which re|moveth the Mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his Anger."&mdash;But is the Lord di&s;plea&s;ed at the Mountains? Or is his Indignation again&s;t the Earth? No, but again&s;t them that dwell upon it; who by their Iniquities provoke him to Wrath, which he &s;ees fit &s;ometimes to manife&s;t in this terrible Way.&mdash;Such angry Vi&s;itations are divine Re|mon&s;trances to the &s;uffering People, again&s;t their Sins: and loud Warnings to the re&s;t of the World, to hear and fear. "Go ye now (&s;aith the Lord) to my Place which was in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> where I &s;et my Name at the fir&s;t; and &s;ee what I did to it, for the Wickedne&s;s of my People <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>However, &s;uppo&s;ing there be <HI>only</HI> Earthquake and great Noi&s;e, without any detrimental Effects, yet is it to be looked on a <HI>Vi&s;it</HI> from the LORD of Ho&s;ts, and u&s;ually in <HI>Anger.</HI> Though Hou&s;es &s;tand, and no Life be lo&s;t, no de&s;tructive Inundation breaking in, nor "Flame of devouring Fire" breaking out; yet may
<PB N="40" REF="007665_0041_102DBAE042FCA9E8">
it be an <HI>angry</HI> Vi&s;itation. There are various Signs of Re&s;entment, be&s;ides &s;tabbing with the Sword, or &s;miting with the Fi&s;t. Anger may be &s;hewn by the Counte|nance, as well as by the Hand; by a Frown, as well as by a Scourge: And by lighter Strokes, or meer Shakings of the Rod, as well as by heavy and de|&s;troying Blows. If God "appoints over us <HI>Terror,</HI>" though without <HI>Con&s;umption;</HI> e&s;pecially if he "&s;mites us with <HI>great Terror</HI> and <HI>A&s;toni&s;hment,</HI>" as in the Earth|quake, if it ri&s;es to any high Degree; when "our Lips quiver, and our Fle&s;h trembleth," at the dreadful Sound in our Ears, and threatning Agitation we feel and &s;ee of all Things about us; and when withal a guilty Con&s;cience, at &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Sea&s;on, awakes, and &s;mites, the Sinner with Remor&s;e and Horror, in the Remembrance of Sin. and under the Apprehen&s;ion of an angry God vi&s;iting his Iniquities. Though indeed this may eventually "turn to his Salvation," yet is it really a Di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Wrath,</HI> a Di&s;play of the "fiery Law" and incen&s;ed Ju&s;tice of Heaven; and appears &s;uch, at pre&s;ent, to the alarmed Sinner.</P>
<P>The Earthquake that fell out at our SAVIOUR's Crucifixion, proclaimed a Divine Indignation at the horrid Fact. The P&s;almi&s;t probably refers to that, where he prophetically &s;ays, "Then the Earth &s;hook and trembled, becau&s;e GOD was wroth." And tho' in the Scripture-Story we do not read of Deva&s;tations by it, of Hou&s;es falling, or of Lives lo&s;t; yet we do of "the People's &s;miting their Brea&s;ts," and returning from the Place of Execution in great Con&s;ternation and A&s;toni&s;hment. The Earthquake with great Noi&s;e, tho' in the Event harmle&s;s, as to outward Effects, yet carry's in it a tremendous Appearance, has the A&s;pect of an angry "Vi&s;itation from the LORD of Ho&s;ts;" and in all common Ca&s;es is to be con&s;idered by us in that Light. As it is written, <Q>The LORD is the true GOD, he is
<PB N="41" REF="007665_0042_102DBAE215E85278">
the living GOD, and an everla&s;ting King&punc; at his Wrath the Earth &s;hall tremble.</Q></P>
<P>But it is Time I come to a CONCLUSION; which I &s;hall do with applying this Subject in a few practical Reflections and Exhortations.</P>
<P N="1">1. In general, let us then &s;ee and own the <HI>Agency</HI> of GOD in the great and terrible Earthquakes, this and other Places have lately felt. Let us reali&s;e it, that herein they and we have been indeed "<HI>vi&s;ited</HI> of the LORD of Ho&s;ts.&mdash;It would be <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> to a&s;cribe the&s;e Events to meer Ca&s;ualty, or Chance: and it would be <HI>vain Philo&s;ophy,</HI> to terminate all our In|quiry in meer natural Cau&s;es. The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> (&s;o called) would be "wor&s;e than an <HI>Infidel,</HI>" not to carry up his Views, to that ALMIGHTY AGENT, who go|verns all Events in univer&s;al Nature. May none a|mong them that name the Name of CHRIST, have that Complaint lying again&s;t them; "LORD, when thy Hand is lifted, they will not &s;ee."&mdash;O that there never were Occa&s;ion to <Q>declare this in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and publi&s;h it in <HI>Judah,</HI> &s;aying, Hear now this, O fooli&s;h People; and without Under&s;tanding, which have Eyes, &amp; &s;ee not, which have Ears, &amp; hear not! Fear ye not ME? &s;aith the LORD: will ye not tremble at MY PRESENCE?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us admire the <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Long-&s;uffering</HI> of GOD towards a <HI>World lying in Wickedne&s;s,</HI> that he no <HI>oftner</HI> repeats his angry Vi&s;itations by de|&s;tructive and terrible Earthquakes.</P>
<P>This Di&s;pen&s;ation may, for its <HI>Unu&s;ualne&s;s,</HI> be term|ed "his <HI>&s;trange</HI> Work. Men's peri&s;hing by Means of an Earthquake was on<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> called "a <HI>new</HI> Thing&punc; (<HI>Num.</HI> 16. 30.) And it has been a <HI>rare</HI> Thing ever &s;ince, com|paratively with their dying by Sickne&s;s, called "the Vi&s;itation of all Men." It is le&s;s infrequent indeed in &s;ome Parts of the Earth, than in others, and perhaps
<PB N="42" REF="007665_0043_102DBAE45AC25F50">
will become more and more common in this la&s;t Age of the World. In a natural Sen&s;e, "the Earth waxes <HI>old,</HI> as doth a Garment:" and an old Garment ea&s;ily admits of Rents. But if we take it in a moral Sen&s;e, as the World grows <HI>old in Sin,</HI> and the final Di&s;&s;olution approaches nearer, we may rea&s;onably expect a greater Frequency of this Divine Judgment.&mdash;In the mean Time, what admiring Thoughts &s;hould we have of the Riches of God's &s;paring Goodne&s;s and Forbearance towards "this pre&s;ent evil World," in general!</P>
<P N="3">3. In particular, let us take a thankful Notice of his <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing Mercy to us;</HI> while we a&s;cribe <HI>Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to him, in his <HI>terrible Doings towards others.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;hould "our Souls magnify the LORD, and our Spirits rejoyce in GOD our Saviour," that We have never yet been "vi&s;ited of the LORD of Ho&s;ts" in the like de&s;tructive Manner as many other Parts have been!&mdash;We have learnt by Experience, that we dwell in a Land liable to the Earthquake. And doubt|le&s;s there are the like Provi&s;ions in <HI>Nature</HI> for Earth|quakes of equal Force, to produce calamitous Effects, corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e in other Places: Nor have we any Grounds to flatter our &s;elves as if &s;ufficient <HI>mo|ral</HI> Cau&s;es were not found among us, even among us.&mdash;<HI>Who then has made us to differ?</HI> And <HI>why</HI> are we di&s;tingui&s;hed from others? Certainly we mu&s;t re|&s;olve it into the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of Him "who hath Compa&s;&s;ion on whom he will have Compa&s;&s;ion." To this it is intirely owing, that the <HI>Vi&s;itations</HI> made us in this Way, though we have Rea&s;on to conclude them <HI>angry</HI> Vi&s;itations, have hitherto been but <HI>di&s;ci|plinary,</HI> and mingled with much Clemency and Ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>As va&s;t as the Mi&s;chiefs impending over us in the Time of our Vi&s;itation, &s;o great is the Deliverance we have received! Let us reflect, and realize, how
<PB N="43" REF="007665_0044_102DBAE687B6D2B0">
the LORD of Ho&s;ts appeared "marching through the Land in Indignation," threatning every Town with in&s;tant Ruin, every Family with immediate De&s;olation, every Per&s;on with &s;udden De&s;truction!&mdash;Let us think; Might not our <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> which tottered and reeled in &s;o amazing a Manner, have fallen in Pieces, and become our Graves!&mdash;Or might not the <HI>Ground</HI> have cleaved under our Feet, and &s;wallowed us up in its di&s;mal Hollows! Might not the Flame of devouring <HI>Fire</HI> have broken out, and con&s;umed us in a Moment! Or the <HI>Sea</HI> have rolled in it's angry Billows, and over|whelmed us with a de&s;olating Flood!&mdash;Truly, we were vi&s;ited in a fearful Manner, and we trembled "becau&s;e of the Shaking of the Hand of the LORD of Ho&s;ts, which he &s;hook over us:" but be&punc; hold, he hath &s;aved us out of our Fears, and hath wrought for us "this great Deliverance."&mdash;Not a Hou&s;e is fallen,&mdash;not a Life is lo&s;t,&mdash;not even a Limb broken! "Prai&s;e ye the LORD."&mdash;"How great is his <HI>Goodne&s;s!</HI>" and how great his <HI>Power,</HI>&mdash;in our wonderful Pre&s;ervation! The &s;ame Divine Hand, that &s;hook our Dwellings in &s;o tremen|dous Manner, held their &s;everal Parts in Union, and re&s;cued their re&s;pective Inhabitants from being cru&s;hed by the Fall of them. The &s;ame Almighty Arm, that &s;hook the Land and Ocean, kept the Foundations from breaking up, and prevented our being deluged by invading Waves, or con&s;umed by re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Flames. He who is "mighty to &s;ave," as well as able to de&s;troy, has wrought marvellou&s;ly for us. His Wrath was kindled, his Hand was &s;tretched out, he terribly &s;hook us, and threatned to &s;mite with a killing Blow: but "Mercy rejoyced again&s;t Judgment." He li&s;tned to the Pleadings of his own Bowels: and "in the mid&s;t of Wrath be remembred Mercy." The compa&s;&s;ionate Keeper of the Vineyard interceeded for the barre&s;t

Figtree, "Spare it this Year al&s;o." And we are once more reprieved from impendent, merited De&s;truction. Though the great Terror has been repeated, yet &s;o likewi&s;e has&punc; been the great Deliverance. We mu&s;t confe&s;s, "It is of the Mercies of the LORD, that we are not con&s;umed," and made the Monuments of his vindictive Ju&s;tice, even as others.</P>
<P>Very &s;urpri&s;ing and mo&s;t melancholy Accounts we have had of late De&s;olations, made by the <HI>Earth|quake</HI> in various Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> more e&s;pecially at LISBON, the Metropolis of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and one of the wealthie&s;t Cities upon Earth: but now lying in Ruins, &s;uppo&s;ed irreparable.

<P>"GOD hath &s;poken in his Holine&s;s."&mdash;We have had a loud Lecture on the Exi&s;tence, Providence, and Perfections of GOD; on the Frailty of Man; the Va|nity of Creature-Helps; our Need of a better Portion than one in the Earth, "this little Dwelling-place of Worms," un&s;table too, and liable to &s;uch &s;hocking Vi|ci&s;&s;itudes; our Need, con&s;equently, of an Intere&s;t in GOD, who is "the Portion of <HI>Jacob,</HI>" through Faith in CHRIST; and &s;o, the Wi&s;dom of the happy Few,

And I earne&s;tly recommend to Per|&s;ons of <HI>every Age,</HI> and <HI>every Order,</HI> Amendment of Life; a due Sen&s;e of their entire Dependence upon the Favour of GOD for every Moment of their Lives, which being thus remarkably pre&s;erved, they are more than ever bound to devote to his Service.</Q>&mdash;May all that bear the Sword of Ju&s;tice, and all &s;ubject to it, hear the&s;e united Calls from GOD and Man.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sure I am, there is great Occa&s;ion; from the abound|ing Iniquity of the Times, for all to join their Endea|vours to promote a Reformation of Manners: and we have had a loud Call to this, in the late awful Vi&s;ita|tion. If we hear and obey, we may hope, that God will "repent him of the Evil he may have thought to bring upon us." But otherwi&s;e, we may ex|pect &s;till angry Vi&s;itations from his provoked Ju&s;tice, and De&s;truction in the End. If we go on to abu&s;e his Patience, we may look, that he will do more terrible Things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that he will not only &s;hake our Earth, but tear up its Foundations; di&s;&s;olve both Church and State, &amp; bury an impenitent People in one common Grave of De&s;olation and Ruin.&mdash;"Thou <HI>Capernaum,</HI> which art lifted up to Heaven, &s;halt be brought down to Hell.&mdash;"Be in&s;tructed, O <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> le&s;t my Soul depart from thee, le&s;t I make thee de&s;olate, a Land not inhabited.&mdash;"Ye that make mention of the LORD, for <HI>Zion'</HI>s &s;ake keep not Silence, and give him no Re&s;t, until he make <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> a Prai&s;e in the Earth, until the Righteou&s;ne&s;s

thereof go forth as Brightne&s;s, and the Salvation there|of as a Lamp that burneth."&mdash;The Divine Author of an Earthquake is equal to this grand Effect. He is &s;uperiour to all Difficulties. He can remove Moun|tains of Guilt, and &s;hake down the &s;trong Holds of Sin and Satan. He can demoli&s;h the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;h and advance the Kingdom of his dear SON. He can effect the mo&s;t glorious &amp; happy &s;piritual Revo|lution, and that very &s;uddenly. But "for this he will be enquired of, to do it for us.&mdash;O let all the Friends of our <HI>Zion</HI> unite their fervent Cries to the GOD of all Grace, that "the SPIRIT may be poured from on high.&mdash;This, and this only, will bring on a &s;ettled and pro&s;perous State of Things; and thus &s;hall "Glory dwell in our Land.</P>
<P>To conclude,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Divine Vi&s;itations with the Earthquake, we have been meditating on, &s;hould remind us of <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> ha&s;tning upon us.&mdash;Though we &s;hould never &s;ee another Vi&s;itation in that Way; yet there is "the Vi&s;itation of all Men" certainly awaiting us. "There is a Time to die;" and "the Grave is ready for us.&mdash;By Sickne&s;s, or Accidents, more common than the Earthquake, and equally irre&s;i&s;tible, Death may arre&s;t us. Then the Earth will be opened for us, and we mu&s;t go down into the Pit of Corruption. Nor know we the Day of our Death. It may come as <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> as an Earthquake. And Oh how deplora|ble our Ca&s;e, if &s;urpri&s;ed in our Sins, unprepared for &s;o great a Change!&mdash;We look al&s;o for <HI>eternal Judg|ment:</HI> and we are told, <HI>"That Day</HI> will come as a Thief in the Night; will come upon Men <HI>unawares;</HI> even as the Flood of old did upon the World of the Ungodly, and as the Vengeance upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> in a Day when they looked not for it.&mdash;"Be ye therefore ready, le&s;t the LORD coming <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> &s;hould find you &s;leep|ing.
<PB N="51" REF="007665_0052_102DBAF91CF888D0">
&mdash;Oh the Con&s;ternation and Horror, which in an In&s;tant unprepared Sinners will be thrown into, at the unexpected coming of the Day of GOD! You may &s;ee a faint Re&s;emblance of it in the De&s;criptions given by the Prophet, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 2. 19, &amp;c. and by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 15, &amp;c. which I leave you to read at your Lea&s;ure.&mdash;Verily "the Day of the LORD JESUS," when he &s;hall "be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire," though it will be a joyful Day to "his Saints, in whom he then will be admired and glorified," yet will it be a terrible Day to Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinners, whom he will then "take Vengeance on, and puni&s;h with ever|la&s;ting De&s;truction;" which al&s;o will be "&s;wift De|&s;truction;" and attended with every aggravating Cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>O let us all now be "per&s;uaded by the Terror of the Lord," to &s;eek an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t; and be concerned to &s;ecure Him for our Friend, who is to be our Judge. So &s;hall we have Peace in Life, Hope in Death, and Boldne&s;s in the Day of Judgment; that great Day of GOD our SAVIOUR, when the Earth &s;hall open, not to &s;wallow up the Living, but to give up the Dead; when "all that are in their Graves &s;hall come forth; they that have done Good, to the Re&s;urrection of Life, but they that have done Evil, to the Re&s;urrection of Damnation:" When "the Heavens &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved and the Earth burnt up, with all the Works therein.&punc; "Neverthele&s;s we, according to his Promi&s;e, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;"Wherefore, Beloved, &s;eeing ye look for &s;uch Things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in Peace, without Spot and blamele&s;s. And account the Long-&s;uffering of our LORD Salvation.&mdash;To HIM be Glory and Dominion for ever. AMEN.</P>
