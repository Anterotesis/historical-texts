<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I BLESS God that I was ever acquainted with Doctor GEORGE DE BENNE|VILLE, for &s;uch an humble, pious, loving man I have &s;carcely ever &s;een in my pil|grimage through life.&mdash;To &s;uch as con&s;ider this account as romantic, ab&s;urd, and incon|&s;i&s;tent, I &s;hall only &s;ay, "that if they had known the author as well as I did, I doubt not they would have thought of him in a good mea&s;ure as I do." I think it impo&s;&s;i|ble that a man of his piety, humility, bene|volence, and univer&s;al good character, &s;hould have been guilty of deliberately im|po&s;ing upon mankind; and from the very nature and circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, I can|not &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf. I have no doubt of

the truth of this relation my&s;elf, and have delivered it faithfully as I received it.

<HEAD>LIFE AND TRANCE OF <HI>Doctor George De Benneville.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I GEORGE DE BENEVILLE, was born in London, July 26th, 1703. My father George De Benneville was a French refu|gee, per&s;ecuted for his religion. He re|tired with his family and connections in|to England upon the invitation of his maje&s;|ty king William, who took a tender care of them, and employed them at his court.</P>
<P>My mother was of the Granville family. She had nine children in five years after mari|age, having twins four years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and I being the la&s;t, &s;he died as &s;oon as I was born. She knew that &s;he would die at that time, and therefore &s;he was very often drawn whil&s;t &s;he was pregnant, to pray for me, and it appears that the Lord heard her prayers and granted her reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o very young when my father died, and was brought up by one of my un|cles. After the death of my mother, Queen Anne her&s;elf provided me a nur&s;e, and &s;he had the care of my fir&s;t years.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="049018_0005_102646B780202290">When arrived at the age of twelve years, I was very wild believing my&s;elf to be of a different ma&s;s from mankind in general, and by this fond imagination I was &s;elf-exalted, and believed-my&s;elf to be more than other men: but God &s;oon convinced me to the contrary.</P>
<P>As it was de&s;igned that I &s;hould learn na|vigation, I was &s;ent to &s;ea in a ve&s;&s;el of war belonging to a little fleet bound to the coa&s;t of Barbary with pre&s;ents, and to renew the peace with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripolis. Being arrived at Algiers, as I walked upon deck I &s;aw &s;ome Moors who brought &s;ome refre&s;hments to fell; one of them &s;lipped down and tore a piece out of one of his legs, two of his companions having lain him on the deck. each of them ki&s;&s;ed the wound, &s;hed|ding tears upon it, then turned towards the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, they cried in &s;uch a man|ner that I was much moved with anger at their making &s;uch a noi&s;e, and ordered my waiter to bring them before me. Upon demanding the rea&s;on of their noi&s;e, the pre|ceived that I was angry, a&s;ked my pardon, and told me the cau&s;e was owing to one of their brothers having hurt his leg by a fall, and that they ki&s;&s;ed the wound in order to &s;ympathize with him, and likewi&s;e &s;hed
<PB N="7" REF="049018_0006_102646B9087C5D00">
tears upon it and took part with him, and as tears were &s;alti&s;h, they were a good re|medy to heal the &s;ame; and the rea&s;on of their turning towards the &s;un's ri&s;ing was to invoke him who created the &s;un to have compa&s;&s;ion upon their poor brother, and prayed he would plea&s;e to heal him. Up, on that I was &s;o convinced, and moved within, that I thought my heart would break, and that my life was about to leave me; my eyes with tears, and I felt &s;uch an internal condemnation, that I was obliged to cry out and &s;ay, "Are the&s;e Heathens? No; I confe&s;s before God they are Chri&s;ti|ans, and I my&s;elf am a Heathen!" Behold the fir&s;t conviction that the grace of our Sovereign Good employed: he was plea&s;ed to convince a white per&s;on by blacks! one who carried the name of a chri&s;tian by a pa|gan, and who was obliged to confe&s;s him&s;elf but a heathen. But that was &s;oon overcome and forgot. But God who always &s;eeks to convince and &s;ave his poor creatures, did not leave his poor wandering &s;heep; for &s;ome time after my return home, being pre|&s;ent by invitation at a ball, and having over heated my&s;elf. I order my &s;ervant to pre|pare linens for me to change, and as I was putting it on, I fell into a fainting fit, and
<PB N="8" REF="049018_0007_102646BB734C2BF0">
had a vi&s;ion of my&s;elf, burning as a fire|brand in hell, and coming to my&s;elf; again, I cried out, "I am damned!" Prayers were de&s;ired in the French Churches for one who had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es and was melancholy&mdash; The mini&s;ters often vi&s;ited me, and would fain have made me believe that I had not committed any very great &s;ins, and that I had behaved according to my rank and &s;ta|tion. Then I was obliged to an&s;wer them, that if they had no other things than tho&s;e to tell me, they could an&s;wer no pur-po&s;e but as fig leaves to cover my &s;hame, and my damnable e&s;tate: that it was in vain to come and vi&s;it me with &s;uch comfort, for that I felt my&s;elf condemned. Then they an&s;wered me in another manner than be|fore, &s;aying, &s;ince I would not receive their remon&s;trances it might be looked upon as a mark that peradventure I was de&s;tined from the begining to condemnation.</P>
<P>Then they gave me up and came no more to vi&s;it me&mdash;After that I continued in the &s;tate of condemnation during the &s;pace of fifteen months, believing that all the world but my&s;elf might be &s;aved, and that I ne|ver could be &s;aved, becau&s;e my &s;ins, as I thought, were too many and too great to be forgiven. At length after the fifteen
<PB N="9" REF="049018_0008_102646BD0536E278">
months were expired, after having pa&s;&s;ed through many temptations, it happened to me one day having laid my&s;elf down to re|po&s;e that I was awakened out of my &s;leep, and heard a voice within me, which pro|nounced the &s;entence of my condemnation, and left me no room to hope. I then di&s;cover|ed the root of all my &s;ins and iniquities within my heart: that di&s;covery brought me into an extreme agony Di&s;pair entered in|to my &s;oul, which was now pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides with mi&s;ery, cau&s;ed e&s;pecially by &s;uch great unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart, which was the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of all my troubles; I could di&s;cover no remedy for my di&s;ea&s;e, but thought that my &s;entence of damnation was going to be executed: the &s;orrow of my &s;oul was even to death: I de&s;ired to die, but death fled from me: I could find no remedy but to leave my&s;elf to the ju&s;tice of my judge for a condemned criminal as I was: I knew that his judgements were ju&s;t, and that I had merited much more than I felt.</P>
<P>Thus abandoning my&s;elf to ju&s;tice, and waiting for its accompli&s;hment in me, I di&s;|cover between ju&s;tice, and me the criminal, one of a mo&s;t maje&s;tic appearance, who&s;e beauty, brightne&s;s, and grandeur can never be di&s;cribed: he ca&s;t &s;uch a look of love on me as
<PB N="10" REF="049018_0009_102646C14E7A63F0">
penetrated through me, the fire of which &s;o embraced my &s;oul that I loved him again with the &s;ame love. He per&s;uaded me in my, heart that he was my Saviour, Mediator and Reconciliator, and while I thought there|on, he began to intercede for me in this manner, &s;aying, "My father, behold me with thy paternal regard, I have made ex|piation for this &s;inner, who hath received in him&s;elf the &s;entence of condemnation. I have taken human nature for him. I have &s;uffered all kind of ignominy for him. I have &s;hed my blood even to the la&s;t drop for him. I have &s;uffered the &s;hameful death of the cro&s;s for him. I have de&s;cended into the aby&s;s of hell for him, that I might deliver him. I have been put to death for his of|fences, and rai&s;ed again for his ju&s;tification, and where his &s;ins abound, our grace abounds much more. Oh! my heavenly father, pardon this poor &s;inner, and cau&s;e thy mercy to come to him." The judge or ju&s;tice had nothing more to &s;ay. The &s;en|tence di&s;appeared. Then I heard his eternal univer&s;al voice, which penetrated through me with divine power, &s;aying, "Take cou|rage my &s;on, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee." Immediately all the burthen of my &s;ins and iniquities was gone, all the &s;tings and re|proaches
<PB N="11" REF="049018_0010_102646C2D781F5A8">
cea&s;ed in a moment, a living faith came in their &s;tead, and the tears of &s;orrow were all wiped from my eyes; I ca&s;t my&s;elf at the feet of my mediator, reconciler, &s;aviour, and interce&s;&s;or, and embraced him with an enlivening faith, melting into tears of love, humility, and nothingne&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord and my God, thou ha&s;t &s;aved me thro' pure grace; what &s;hall I ren|der to thee for all thy benefits? Oh! my di|vine love, whom I honor and adore, give me a pure a holy heart, filled with thy vir|tues and thy love, even &s;uch as thou would&s;t that I &s;hould have; and renew a right &s;pi|rit within my brea&s;t. Now know that thy marvellous mercy hath given me a &s;avior before I knew my danger and &s;lavery; a phy&s;ician who had the care of my di&s;ea&s;e be|fore that I felt or knew the &s;ame; a redeem|er who undertook to pay the debt that I was neither willing nor able to pay. Oh! my benefactor, guide me by the efficacy of thy &s;pirit to walk in the way of thy truth and univer&s;al love. Teach me thy eternal and univer&s;al word; &s;peak my Lord and my God, for thy &s;ervant heareth. Give me thy grace, oh my divine love, that I may have the eyes of my faith fixed con&s;tantly upon thee, and that I may follow thee whe|ther&s;oever
<PB N="12" REF="049018_0011_102646C59DABD340">
thou maye&s;t plea&s;e to lead me. That thy holy will may be accompli&s;hed in time and eternity, to the prai&s;e of thy glory, and my compleat &s;alvation.</P>
<P>O my dear &s;oul, &s;ink, thy&s;elf down in|to nothingne&s;s and the deepe&s;t humiliation, and adore in &s;pirit and in truth; honor the ocean of love, and the great wonders of the wi&s;dom and power of thy God, who hath employed all the&s;e boundle&s;s in comprehen&s;i|ble miracles to re&s;tore and to &s;ave thee, and not thee only, but all the human &s;pecies, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. Oh! the depth of the riches, both of the wi&s;dom and power of God, how un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out: for of him and through him, and for him are all things. To him be glory eternal.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e his goodne&s;s &s;hines. for God hath loved me before that I was born. Oh! what grace. God him&s;elf hath loved me in my fallen e&s;tate, whence I was wholly lo&s;t. Oh! what mercy: God hath even loved me when I was altogether un|worthy, and that freely too.&mdash;Oh! what love.</P>
<P>He hath given me his well-beloved &s;on: and in giving his beloved &s;on, he hath given me his paternal heart: and at the time that
<PB N="13" REF="049018_0012_10263998D1C86610">
he took human nature, he became my pa|rent, that by this parentage he might oblige him&s;elf to have a right to love and to have the care of me. I feel him the ju&s;t, for my offences and wickedne&s;s which he had ta|ken to bear as his own, brought before the mo&s;t righteous judgment &s;eat, where he him&s;elf alone paid the la&s;t penny of the dreadful debt of all the world. I beheld him upon the cro&s;s deface and de&s;troy the obligation that was again&s;t me, and after that he entered once for all into the holy place by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption for me. Approach then now, Oh! my &s;oul, love him which ha&s;t loved thee fi&s;t. Love him eternally, with all thy heart, with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy might, who hath made thee to know by ex|perience the great my&s;teries of his holy love, re&s;pecting all his creatures.&mdash;Hallelujah&mdash; Amen.</P>
<P>O what an alteration from being a child of darkne&s;s to a child of light; now I know in whom I have believed, and de&s;ire to con|&s;ecrate my&s;elf to my Lord, my Sovereign Good, the remainder of my days.</P>
<P>My conver&s;ion made a great noi&s;e among the people, for they &s;aw me prai&s;ing and adoring my divine Savior on all occa&s;ions,
<PB N="14" REF="049018_0013_102646C85D804EA0">
and before all company where I came with|out exception; calling and exhorting each one to &s;ubmit to the love of God, ju&s;t as they found them&s;elves, and although their &s;ins were many and great, his grace was geater to receive and pardon, but that we mu&s;t come as we are, for he is the begining and the end of the conver&s;ion of all the human &s;pecies, and who&s;oever is not converted by him, and to him, is not converted at all.</P>
<P>The French mini&s;ters were very unea&s;y at what they heard concerning me, doubt|ing that I was not a true prote&s;tant, and therefore they demanded a written confe&s;&s;i|on of my faith; I told them paper would &s;uf|fer any thing to be written upon it, truth or fal&s;hood, but that I was not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s with my mouth what I believed in my heart, and that if they would let me know when they would meet together, I would be ready to appear before them to give them an account of my faith, and the wonders which the mo&s;t holy trinity had wrought within me.</P>
<P>The time was fixed and I appeared be|fore them. They a&s;ked me many que|&s;tions, but we could not agree, for they held prede&s;tination, and I held the re&s;tora|on of all &s;ouls; becau&s;e having my&s;elf been
<PB N="15" REF="049018_0014_102646CBDB30AD98">
the chief of &s;inners, and that God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the efficacy of his holy &s;pi|rit, had granted me mercy and the pardon of all my &s;ins, and had plucked me as a brand out of hell, I could not have a doubt but the whole World would be &s;aved by the &s;ame power. They an&s;wered me that I mu&s;t not take it ill that they could not own me as a member of their church. I replied, that I was very well content to be ca&s;t out, and that my con&s;olation was, that they were not able to blot my name out of the book of life.</P>
<P>Soon after I got acquainted with &s;ome per&s;ons who led a very retired life, having received a deep knowledge of them&s;elves thro' grace: we &s;ometimes met together, but we &s;oon were per&s;ecuted with reproach.</P>
<P>After that I received a voice of grace in|wardly to go and preach the go&s;pel in France; I re&s;i&s;ted it more than once or twice, fearing per&s;ecution. but I was &s;truck with a &s;ickne&s;s and had pain like the agony of death, was ready to die, and knowing it was becau&s;e I had not hearkened to that voice that had called me to bear witne&s;s to the truth of <HI>France,</HI> I humbled my&s;elf be|fore my God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Lord, a&s;ked pardon for my offences, and promi&s;|ing
<PB N="16" REF="049018_0015_102646CD65C5B168">
to &s;ubmit my&s;elf to follow his voice, upon which I was immediately healed; and grew more robu&s;t than I had ever been be|fore. Then I heard his voice once more, calling me to go to France to preach the go&s;|pel, and I found my&s;elf obliged in my &s;oul to follow the voice, through with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>I took pa&s;&s;age at Dover for Calais, and immediately upon my arrival I began to preach and proclaim the good news in the market, even the eternal &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t within us, and that each one of us might be &s;aved by pure grace, and that who&s;o|ever knowing him&s;elf, feeling the burden of his iniquities, having recour&s;e to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, refining him&s;elf without re&s;erve, with all his &s;ins, even had he found him&s;elf in his dam|nable e&s;tate, &s;hould be delivered, and ob|tain the pardon of all his &s;ins.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had done I was taken before a magi&s;trate, who made me to know that my conduct was contrary to the &s;tature of the king: I was then conducted to pri&s;on, where I was no &s;ooner arrived than all the fear of per&s;ecution vani&s;hed; my &s;oul was &s;trength|ened in the Lord Je&s;us; I felt the love of my divine &s;avior very near accompained with his divine light. After &s;ome days had
<PB N="17" REF="049018_0016_102646D0242207D0">
pa&s;t, I was brought before the ju&s;tice, &amp; exa|mined by what order I preached; I told him who I was, and that I was drawn by the &s;pecial grace of my God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the power of his holy &s;pirit, to teach the nations, and that for refu&s;ing to obey the voice of my God I was taken very &s;ick. While they were examining me there came in an old man with a white beard; all the ju&s;tices &s;aluted him: he &s;aid to them, have nothing to do with this per&s;on, for I have &s;uffered much this night pa&s;t on his account, and retired immediately.</P>
<P>I was then condemed to eight days im|pri&s;onment, as it was the fir&s;t time, and to be conducted by the &s;ervant of the magi&s;trate out of the bounds of the city, letting me know that if I was found employed in the &s;ame manner a &s;econd time, my life would be in danger.</P>
<P>I was about 17 years of age when I began to preach in France. In this manner I em|ployed two years in that kingdom, preach|ing the go&s;pel in high and low Normandy, the country of my father, for he was born in the city of Rouan.</P>
<P>There were many mini&s;ters of us toge|ther; <HI>Mon&s;r. Durant, de la Chevrette; Du|moulin, L'Achar, &amp;c.</HI> We met together
<PB N="18" REF="049018_0017_102646D2B5C8DC20">
in mountains and woods, to the number of 400 where God very often wrought great wonder by the power of the go&s;pel, among men and women, and even boys and girls, of the age of twelve or fifteen years, that did not even know how to read or write.&mdash; They were convinced by the power of grace, and began to proclaim the go&s;pel with a mo&s;t marvelous &s;trength of &s;pirit, without any fear, being embraced by love divine.</P>
<P>We were many times taken pri&s;oners du|ring the two years, &s;ometimes by means of our own brothers, who would go and inform the &s;oldiers in the ma&s;hel&s;ey where we were met together.</P>
<P>Many of us were hanged, others whiped by the hands of the hangman, and brand|ed with a hot iron; all their goods confi&s;|cated, and they &s;ent on boad the galleys, but all that did not weaken us, but on the the contrary, the grace of our divine love &s;trengthened us to a wonder.</P>
<P>At la&s;t we were &s;urrounned by a par|ty of &s;oldiers one day when we were a&s;&s;em|by the &s;ide of <HI>Dieppe,</HI> where many of us were taken pri&s;oners, among whom was my&s;elf, and a Mr. <HI>Durant,</HI> a young man a|bout 24 years of age, of <HI>Geneoa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="049018_0018_102646D60E54C320">After a month impri&s;onment we were condemned to die, he to be hanged, and I to have my headcut off. We were conduct|ed together to the place of execution; he &s;ung the 116 p&s;alm when on the ladder, and died joyfully.</P>
<P>I was then conducted to the &s;caffold, my eyes were ordered to be bound to prevent my &s;eeing, but upon my earne&s;t reque&s;t that was omitted.</P>
<P>I then fell upon my knees, and praying the Lord that he would not require my blood at their hands, as they knew not what they did; my &s;oul was filled with exceeding joy. The executioner bound my hands, and while he was employed in &s;o doing a courier arrived from the king, which was Louis XV, with a reprieve for the criminal. Immediately the joy of my heart was gone, and darkne&s;s entered into my &s;oul. I was then reconducted to pri&s;on at Paris, where I was confined &s;ometime before I was libera|ted thro' the interce&s;&s;ion of the queen.</P>
<P>Many things happened to me during my exile in France, and the time of my con|finement One may ea&s;ily di&s;cover here, that the grace of our God never leaves tho&s;e who tru&s;t in him and are faithful, un|til death.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="049018_0019_102646D7A2EEA850">After my relea&s;ement I retired into Ger|many, where I began to learn the language with great difficulty. I found many &s;ouls who were convinced by grace, and who led a very retired life among the French refu|gees at Bulin, Madeburg. Brandeburg, Brun&s;wick in the Palatinate, Hamburg, Al|tona, Stade, Gluck&s;tadt, Bremen, the country of Hanover, in Flanders, Brabant, the low land of Holland, the country of Walden&s;es and many other places.</P>
<P>I found work all round, &s;ouls who de&s;i|red to be &s;aved. I had al&s;o a large acquain|tance among the nobility in Germany, and Holland; we had a large communion of brethern and &s;i&s;ters in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>I was wholly employed in traveling from place to place, in vi&s;iting the brethern and preaching to the nations, in the German, French, and Dutch language. There were many a&s;&s;emblies of brethern all around: in &s;ome places we had liberty, and where that could not be had publicly, we met &s;ecretly in particular families; but neverthele&s;s grace wrought wonders in convincing &s;ouls, and leading them to a real deep knowledge of them&s;elves, and of the damnable e&s;tate into which all men are plunged by nature, for
<PB N="21" REF="049018_0020_102646DA3B0D4770">
none can obtain &s;alvation without being fir&s;t damned in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I was much concerned about the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, and their e&s;tate deeply effected me. I had al&s;o an acquaintance with a company gentry, who dwelt together near Siegen, &s;ome of them were married, but only dwelt together as brethern and &s;i&s;ters. The ba|ron of Peuchink, the lord of Flei&s;hbein; and the court of mar&s;ey, who was employ|ed in writing books, which are printed in French and German. They led a very re|tired life, filled with love and friend&s;hip to all the world, without bound, and were very charitable both to friends and enemies.</P>
<P>Our acquaintance with each other happen|ed in a wonderful manner.&mdash;One day bro|ther Mar&s;ey had a vi&s;ion concerning me, when I had arrived in the Palatinate, being about twenty leagues from him. I was drawn by grace, being engaged in pro&s;trat|ing my&s;elf in &s;pirit before the pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t holy trinity, and having a vi&s;ion, I di&s;covered a marvellous throne with &s;even foot-&s;tools, upon each foot-&s;tool were two candle&s;ticks of gold, and upon the throne I &s;aw a greater table with &s;even candle&s;ticks of gold placed in a round figure upon it.; then I &s;aw many with robes, whiter than
<PB N="22" REF="049018_0021_102646DCD50BCD58">
&s;now, who &s;tood up near the candle&s;ticks of gold on each &s;ide of the foot-&s;tools and a|round the table. Immediately the candle|&s;ticks were lighted &amp; chairs were brought that each one might &s;et down, then they began to honor the mo&s;t high, &s;o that my &s;oul was le&s;t in admiration: then altogether bend|ing their knees, the whole company adored the mo&s;t holy trinity; the vi&s;ion vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant, and I came to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some little time after my brother Mar&s;ey &s;ent a letter to me, writen after this manner.</P>
<P>My well beloved and dear brother in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, the mo&s;t holy trinity di&s;covers many wonders to his children, who are rooted upon the rock of deliverance, and have their eyes of faith fixed upon their &s;overeign good; he honors them with his univer&s;al pre&s;ence, and embraces them with the fire of heavenly love; as I have been favoured with the con&s;olation of &s;eeing you in his holy Pre&s;ence, I hope you will not deny that communion in the body that we have had together in &s;pirit, to the prai&s;e of the glory of our God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, by the efficacy of his holy &s;pirit.&mdash;Thus wi&s;hes and dwells for ever, MARSEY your Brother, united by the grace of God, Amen."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="049018_0022_102646E039AA2D30">After I had pa&s;&s;ed about 18 years in Germany, and Holland, I became &s;ickly of a con&s;umptive di&s;order, occa&s;ioned by being greatly concerned for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, and much di&s;quited becau&s;e the great|e&s;t part by far walked in the ways of per|ver&s;ne&s;s, and neglected their conver&s;ion, which cau&s;ad me great trouble, and I took it &s;o to heart that I believed my happine&s;s would be incomplete, while one creature re|mained mi&s;erable. Sometimes I was little comforted within by grace in&s;ome manner, but that did not la&s;t long.</P>
<P>I dwelt at that time in the country with the brethern near the city of Mons, an Ha|guiauth near the border of France, in the emperor's dominions.</P>
<P>My fever increa&s;ed to &s;uch a manner as reduced me almo&s;t to a &s;keleton, &s;o that they were obliged to feed me as an infant. While I lay in this weak &s;ituation, I was fa|voured thro' grace with many vi&s;ions: in one it appeared to me that I was conducted into a fine plain, filled with all kinds of fruit trees, agreeable both to the &s;ight and &s;mell, loaded wiih all kinds of the mo&s;t delici|ous fruits, which came to my mouth, and &s;atisfied me as with a river of plea&s;ure: &s;ame time I beheld the inhabitants, they were
<PB N="24" REF="049018_0023_102646E1C6919078">
beautiful beyond expre&s;&s;ion, cloathed in garments as white as &s;now. They were filled with humility, and their friend&s;hip and love was towards all beings: they &s;a|luted me with the mo&s;t profound reverence and mo&s;t lovely air, &s;aying to me with the voice of love, which penetrated thro' me: &mdash;"Dear &s;oul take courage, be comforted, for in a little time you &s;hall &s;ee the wonders of God, in the re&s;toration of all the human &s;pecies, without excepcion."</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s of my body &s;o increa&s;ed that I was certain of dying. I exhorted my breathern to be faithful unto death,! to be &s;tedfa&s;t, immoveable, and to be always turning inward with an enlivening faith, to behold with a fixed attention the Lamb of God, with believing eyes, and to hear|ken to his eternal word within them, and that then they &s;hould receive of the fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t's grace upon grace, by which they &s;hould be &s;trengthened to abide &s;tedfa&s;t unto the end.</P>
<P>As I had communion with many a&s;&s;em|blies of brethern, but in particular with that connected with my dear brother Mar&s;ey; the brethern there had a vi&s;ion of my death and &s;ent brother Mar&s;ey to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>When he arrived he found me in the
<PB N="25" REF="049018_0024_102646E4382EF710">
agonies of death: he embraced me with a ki&s;s of peace &amp; love, and &s;aluted me in the name of the brethern, who recommended them|&s;elves to me, and de&s;ired that I would remember them before the throne of God &amp; the Lamb.</P>
<P>He then took leave of me and I felt my|&s;elf die by degrees, and exactly at midnight I was &s;eparated from my body, and &s;aw the people occupied in wa&s;hing it, according to the cu&s;tom of the country. I had a great de&s;ire to be freed from the &s;ight of my body, and immediately I was drawn up as in a cloud, and beheld great wonders where I pa&s;&s;ed, impo&s;&s;ible to be written or expre&s;&s;|ed. I quickly came to a place which ap|peared to my eyes as a level plain, &s;o ex|ten&s;ive that my &s;ight was not able to reach its limits, filled with all &s;orts of delightful fruit trees, agreeable to behold, and which &s;ent forth &s;uch fragrant odours that all the air was filled as with incen&s;e. In this place I found that I had two guardians, one at my right hand, and the other at my left, exceeding beautiful beyond expre&s;&s;ion, who&s;e boundle&s;s friend&s;hip and love &s;eemed to penetrate through all my inward parts.&mdash; They had wings, and re&s;embled angels, ha|ving &s;hining bodies and white garments.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="049018_0025_102646E7ACF58198">He that was at my right hand came before me and &s;aid&mdash;"My dear &s;oul and my dear brother, take courage, the mo&s;t holy trinity hath favored you to be comforted with an everla&s;ting and univer&s;al con&s;olation, by di&s;|covering to you how, and in what manner he will re&s;tore all his creatures without ex|ception, to the prai&s;e of his glory, and their eternal &s;alvation; and you &s;hall be witne&s;s of this, and &s;hall rejoice in &s;inging and tri|umph with all the children of God, there|fore as a reward for the friend&s;hip and love that you have borne for your neigh|bors, on who&s;e accounts you had many ex|treme griefs, and &s;hed many tears, which &s;hall be all wiped away from your eyes by God him&s;elf, who &s;hall turn all your griefs to exceeding great gladne&s;s." Then he took his place at my right hand. After that the &s;econd guardian who was at my left hand appeared before me, and &s;poke thus: "My dear &s;oul, my dear bro|ther, be of good cheer, thou &s;halt be &s;trength|ened and comforted after your griefs, with an univer&s;al and eternal con&s;olation&mdash;You mu&s;t be prepared to pa&s;s through the &s;even habitations of the damned; be of good cou|rage, and prepare your&s;elf to feel &s;omething of their &s;ufferings, but be turned inward

deeply, during the time, and you &s;hall thereby be pre&s;erved." Then he took his place at my left hand: immediately we were lifted up in the air, and &s;ometime after we arrived in a dark ob&s;cure place, where no|thing but weeping, lamentation, and gna&s;h|ing of teeth, could be under&s;tood. A dread|ful place, as being the repo&s;itory of all &s;orts of damned &s;ouls, under condemnation with the torments, pains, griefs and &s;ufferings which their &s;ins had merited, for each one had his works to follow him in death. All iniquities and &s;ins were reduced to &s;e|ven cla&s;&s;es or habitations: there was an eter|nal confu&s;ion there, that which one made the other de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The duelli&s;t, in his fire of anger burns a|gain&s;t his enemy, and they pa&s;s as a fire-brand of hell, one thro' the other.</P>
<P>You might &s;ee fornicators, idoliters, a|dulterers, thieves, the covetous, drunkards, &s;landerers, ravi&s;hers, &amp;c. each being la|boring and being employed with his &s;ins and iniquities. One might al&s;o &s;ee all kind of conditions of men, divines, deputies, controvertors, advocates, judges, lawyers, and in a word one might di&s;cover what&s;o|ever any of them had done upon earth. In each habitation, I di&s;covered that tho&s;e who
<PB N="28" REF="049018_0027_102646EBB4EE56B8">
were aba&s;ed and that appeared &s;orrowful for their &s;ins, were &s;eperated from the others of their &s;ort that were not yet &s;o. I was then conducted into each of the &s;even habitati|ons of the damned, where I knew one I had been acquainted with upon earth. I di&s;covered al&s;o that he had an habitation a|mong the damned, and that they were able to &s;ee the elect from that habitation where he was, but were not able to pa&s;s through, be|cau&s;e there was a great gulph between them, &s;o that all are obliged to dwell where they are.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe my condition. as I had great compa&s;&s;ion towards the &s;uf|ferers. ina&s;much as I had part of their &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>After we had pa&s;&s;ed thro' we were lifted up &s;ome di&s;tance from the place, where we repo&s;ed our&s;elves; and a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to us, who watered or refre&s;hed us as with a river of plea&s;ure, &s;aying eat my belove|ed &amp; drink my friends, to refre&s;h your&s;elves after all your toils and pains; my dear &s;oul, and my dear brother, (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me) the mo&s;t holy trinity always works wonders in all times within his poor crea|tures without exception, and he will order for a time and half a time, that you &s;hall

<P>Beholding the me&s;&s;enger attentively, I di&s;covered that he had a mo&s;t glorious body, dre&s;&s;ed in a robe whiter than &s;now, filled with the mo&s;t exalted love and friend|&s;hip, joined with the deepe&s;t humility, which penetrated me thro' and through, and &s;uddenly there was heard a great multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, and the me&s;&s;enger &s;aid, as he flew to join the &s;ame, with a &s;weet voice&mdash;"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and who is to come."</P>
<P>The multitude were innumerable, and there was one who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in granduer, beauty, brightne&s;s, maje&s;ty, magnificence and excellence, all the others; even the &s;on of the living God, being the brighine&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per|&s;on, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by him&s;elf purg|ed our &s;ins, &s;at down at the right hand of the maje&s;ty on high.</P>
<P>As the multitude approached the glory

cau&s;ed us to fall down, and to adore in &s;pi|rit and in truth the &s;on of the living God, who marched in the mid&s;t of the multiutude.</P>
<P>After they had pa&s;&s;ed us, we were lifted up, and cau&s;ed to follow them, for the air carried us the way they went, in a different manner than before. Oh! the wonders of our God! When we arrived in the place of the &s;even habitations of the damned, we could preceive no more darkne&s;s, ob&s;curity, pains, torments, lamentations, afflictions, nor gna&s;hing of teeth; all were &s;till and quiet, and an agreeable &s;weetne&s;s appeared thro' the whole. Then all the heavenly ho&s;t &s;houted with one voice and &s;aid, "An eter|nal and everla&s;ting deliverance, an eternal and everla&s;ting re&s;toration, univer&s;al and everla&s;ting re&s;titution of all things." Then all the multitude adored the mo&s;t holy trini|ty, and &s;ung the &s;ong of the Lamb, even the &s;ong of the triumph for the victory gained by him, in the mo&s;t harmonious manner, and at the end, all the multitude being upon their knees, &s;aid with a loud voice, "Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord, God Almighty, ju&s;t and true are thy ways, Oh!

from each, and being cloathed in white robes. they followed the heavenly ho&s;t, prai&s;ing and glorifying the mo&s;t high for their deliverance; one might know them a|mong&s;t the others: they all retired by a dif|ferent way than that which they came. The me&s;&s;enger then came and conducted us into a mo&s;t wonderful place, and ordered my two guardians to conduct me into five cele&s;tial man&s;ions, where the Lord's elect abide; and then to reconduct me to dwell yet a time and a half time in my earthly ha|bitation, and to preach to the lower world the univer&s;al everla&s;ting go&s;pel; and that the mo&s;t Holy Trinity hath a pure univer|&s;al love towards all the human race, with|out exception, and to each in particular; then turning him&s;elf towards me he &s;aid, my dear &s;uol thou &s;halt be favored of the mo&s;t Holy Trinity, to be conducted by thy guardians, who &s;hall never leave thee: when thou &s;halt have need of their coun&s;el; thou neede&s;t but to call them; and they &s;hall be day and night pre&s;ent at thy &s;ervice; they &s;hall conduct thee into five of the heavenly man&s;ions at this time, where thou &s;halt par|take in a certain degree, of the cele&s;tial glo|ry as much as thy &s;pirit &s;hall be able to re|ceive, as not being yet &s;anctified and purifi|ed

<P>After that my guardians conducted me into five cele&s;tial habitations, where I di&s;|covered many wonders. Some had greater brightne&s;s, glory, and maje&s;ty than others, and as the places were, &s;o were the inhabi|tants; &s;ome were clothed in garments whi|ter than &s;now; others had tran&s;parent bo|dies, and others again had white bodies re|&s;embling chry&s;tal. It is impo&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s the&s;e things. They were moved by boundle&s;s burning love, ri&s;ing up, and then plunging them&s;elves into the deepe&s;t hu|mility: all their motions were penetrating,

They have no need of any way of &s;peaking there, but the language and motions of eternal and univer&s;al love without words for their actions, their motions &s;peak more than all words. I was then conducted into five habitations of the elect. At the fir&s;t a great multitude came before us with &s;ongs to the honor and glory of the mo&s;t high, and of the victory gained over the damned. They received us with triumph, great zeal, love and friend&s;hip, &s;a|luting us with profound humility, and con|ducting us into a large room: there was a great table covered and furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of fruit, not only plea&s;ant to behold but al&s;o exceeding delicious to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In the mean while we were taking our re|pa&s;t, the cele&s;tial multitudes formed &s;ongs, and &s;ung p&s;alms of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to the mo&s;t holy trinity. After that we were conducted into all the five cele&s;tial ha|bitations, (that I was to &s;ee) where I &s;aw

many wonders, impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe.

All the elect, with the heavenly &s;pi|rits, joined their interce&s;&s;ion with that of their Royal High Prie&s;t, the only chief king, being reconcilers, &s;aviors, and re|&s;tores in the &s;ame &s;pirit.&mdash;This mutual in|terce&s;&s;ion appeared like incence a&s;cending on high into the &s;anctuary of the Lord. Over again&s;t the throne I di&s;covered Adam, with Eve, rejoicing in the only mediator between God and men, and adoring toge|ther the mo&s;t Holy Trinity for the deliver|ance of their children out of the great mi|&s;eries and eternal condemnation into which their &s;in and fall had brought them, and upon their bended knees adoring the only mediator for the interce&s;&s;ion he makes in behalf of mankind. Al&s;o I beheld a multi|tude of &s;pirits flying and enflamed with the fire of heavenly love, while we adored,

<P>Being in this manner conducted into five cele&s;tial habitations, I di&s;covered many my|&s;teries, &s;aw many miracles, and beheld the wonders of the mo&s;t Holy Trinity among the children, the elect, the heavenly inha|bitants, and perceiving how &s;ome &s;urpa&s;&s;ed others in brightne&s;s, light, &s;plendor, and maje&s;ty, in friend&s;hip, love, humiliation and &s;elf-aba&s;ement, concerning of which things my tongue is too feeble to &s;peak, and my pen to write.
