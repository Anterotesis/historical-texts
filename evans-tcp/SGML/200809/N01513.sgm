<HEAD>ANSWER To what has been offer'd as Argument again&s;t the Validity and Force of an Act of A&s;&s;embly, Entituled, <HI>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called</HI> Quakers, &amp;c. Pa&s;&s;ed in the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> in the 13<HI>th</HI> Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS there has been of late an Objection, without any Foun|dation in Law or Rea&s;on, &s;tarted again&s;t the People call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> their being Imploy'd in any Places or Po&s;ts of Profit or Tru&s;t in this Province; which Objection, in my Opinon, has a Tendency of no le&s;s Con&s;equence than the rendring the Municipal Laws thereof of no Force or Effect for the Future, and Subverting the Civil Government; I have Judg'd it Nece&s;&s;ary for the Satisfaction of the Minds of the Scrupulous, and Stopping the Mouths of the Clamorous and Siditious, until a more Effectual Method may be pur&s;u'd, if Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to require, to &s;et that Affair in &s;o clear a light, that the Half-&s;ighted may See, and the half-witted be Convinced of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Ab&s;urdity of that Objection. The re&s;t can &s;ee and under&s;tand without my Help.</P>
<P>The whole Force of their Objection Leans upon this. <HI>There is,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>an Act pa&s;&s;ed in</HI> Great Britain, <HI>in the Fir&s;t Year of His Majesties Reign, Entituled,</HI> An Act for making Perpetual an Act of the 7<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> Years of the Reign of his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>William the Third, Entituled,</HI> An Act that The Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;hall be accepted in &s;tead of an Oath in the u&s;ual Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Act of the fir&s;t of King <HI>George</HI> Extends that Act of King <HI>Williams</HI> to the Plantations, by the la&s;t Clau&s;e in it, in the&s;e Words,
<Q><HI>Provided always,</HI> That &s;o much of <HI>this</HI> Act as Relates to the Affirmations to be made by the People call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> &s;hall be Extended to that Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> call'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> forever, and to the Plantations belonging to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for Five Years, and to the end of the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament after the &s;aid Five Years, and no longer.</Q>
And that Act of King <HI>William</HI> has in it the following Clau&s;e,
<Q><HI>Provided, and be it Enacted,</HI> That no <HI>Quaker</HI> or reputed <HI>Quaker</HI> &s;hall BY VIRTUE OF THIS ACT, be qualified or permited to give Evidence in any Criminal Cau&s;es, or Serve on any Jury's, or bear any Office or place of Pro|fit in the Government, any thing in THIS ACT contained to the Contrary not|with&s;tanding.</Q>
<HI>Now,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>The Law past in this Province &s;ome time ago for qualifiing That People for Places of Profit and Tru&s;t, is by that of the fir&s;t of King</HI> George, <HI>above mentioned, Repealed and of no longer Force, and Con&s;equently</HI> Quakers <HI>can no longer enjoy Places of Profit,</HI> &amp;c. This is all that has come to my Ears upon this head that has the Appearance of any Meaning in it.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I &s;hall ob&s;erve in General, into what a woeful Condition mu&s;t the Plan|tations be Plung'd, if &s;uch Laws as &s;hall by a Legi&s;lature, I awfully Con&s;tituted by virtue of the Letters Pattent, under the broad Seal, be Enacted for the Good
<PB N="2" REF="001796_0002_0FB832B591357CB0">
Government and Ea&s;e of the Subjects there, &s;hall by Implication or Con&s;truction, he deemed to be Repealed upon the Sugge&s;tion of any petty Attorney who &s;hall or may affirm for Excu&s;e, that he may &s;ay what he thinks fit for the Benefit of his Clyent.</P>
<P>But in the next place, That Act of A&s;&s;embly is not &s;o much as by Implication Repealed; for the Words in that Act upon which they lay the &s;tre&s;s of this Argu|ment, are the&s;e, "<HI>Provided,</HI> That no <HI>Quaker</HI> &s;hall by Virtue of <HI>THIS</HI> Act, be Qualified, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, I know no Quaker that pretends that he is or can by Virtue of THAT Act be qualified, but I believe every Quaker thinks that he is or may be qualified <HI>by Virtue of an Act of A&s;&s;embly,</HI> Entituled, <HI>An Act that the Solemn Affir|mation and Declaration of the People called</HI> Quakers, &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ed in this Province, and &s;ent home for the approbation of the Soveraign above two Years ago, and for any thing I have heard to the contrary, Approv'd and Ratify'd. It is as plain as Words can make it, that <HI>That</HI> Act of the 7<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> of King <HI>VVilliam</HI> has <HI>No Negative</HI> but upon it &s;elf, and Con&s;equently cannot be alledged in Bar to any Laws already Enacted in the Plantations, or even &s;uch as may be Enacted; for by the&s;e Letters Patent, which give a being to this Government and Legi&s;lature, all &s;uch Laws as &s;hall be Enacted by the Governour, Council and A&s;&s;embly, are declared to be in Full Force from the time of Enacting. The Governour, indeed, by his In&s;tructions is Commanded
<Q>Not to give his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent to any Bills of Unu&s;ual and Extaordinary Nature and Importance, wherein the Prerogative Royal of the Crown, or the Property of the Subject may be prejudiced, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e all Laws enacted there, are in Force from the time of Enacting; and if he Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;es in this point, He is accountable for it.</Q>
But the Law in Que&s;tion is &s;o far from the Su&s;pition of being of that Nature, that it is exactly conformable to the Governours In&s;tructions, and what he had in Command from the Soveraign, in the following words, being the 60<HI>th</HI> and 61<HI>st</HI> In&s;truction to him under the Queens hand and Seal,</P>
<Q>AND Whereas We have been Informed that divers of our good Subjects In|habiting tho&s;e parts do make a Religious Scruple of Swearing, and by rea&s;on of their Refu&s;al to take an Oath in Courts of Ju&s;tice, and other places, are or may be lyable to many Inconveniencys, <HI>Our Will and Plea&s;ure is,</HI> that in Order to their ea&s;e in what they conceive to be matter of Con&s;cience, &s;o far as may be con&s;i&s;tent with good Order and Government, you take care that an Act be pa&s;|&s;ed by the General A&s;&s;embly of our &s;aid Province to the like Effect as that pa&s;t here in the 7<HI>th</HI> and 8<HI>th</HI> Year of his late Maje&s;tys Reign, Entituled <HI>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called</HI> Quakers, <HI>&s;hall be accep|ted in&s;tead of an Oath in the u&s;ual Form,</HI> and that the &s;ame be tran&s;mitted to Us, and to our Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations, as before directed. And whereas We have been further informed, That in the fir&s;t Settlement of the Govern|ment of our &s;aid Plantation, it may &s;o happen that the Number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to Serve in our Council, of the General A&s;&s;embly, and in <HI>other Places of Trust or Profit there,</HI> will be but &s;mall, it is therefore <HI>Our Will and Plea&s;ure,</HI> that &s;uch of the &s;aid People called Quakers as &s;hall be &s;ound capable of any of tho&s;e Places or Imployments, and accordingly be Elected or appointed to Serve therein, may, upon their taking and &s;igning the Declaration of Allegiance to Us, in the Form u&s;ed by the &s;ame People in this Kingdom, together with a Solemn De|claration for the true Di&s;charge of their re&s;pective Tru&s;ts, be admitted by you into any of the &s;aid Places or Imployments.</Q>
<P>Which In&s;tructions are contained al&s;o in His pre&s;ent Maje&s;tys In&s;tructions to the Governor, dated at <HI>St. James</HI>'s the Fir&s;t Day of <HI>July,</HI> 1715. word for word.</P>

<HEAD>A SPEECH Made by the Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> in the Supream Court at <HI>Burlington,</HI> the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May,</HI> 1716. before the Grand Jury was Sworn and Affirmed.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now the &s;ixth time I have had the Honour to &s;it here in the Month of <HI>May.</HI> I was called to the Office of Chief Ju&s;tice at a time when it was vacant, without my &s;eeking. In the Opinion of many Per&s;ons the greater part and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable for Wealth and Intere&s;t, of the fir&s;t Settlers in the <HI>We&s;tern-Divi&s;ion,</HI> are of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> or &s;o reputed to be; and the&s;e (among&s;t other things) do di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, by refu&s;ing to take an Oath in Form by Law pre&s;cribed to be u&s;ed generally. The late Queen <HI>Anne</HI> (of ble&s;&s;ed Memory) having this under her Royal Con&s;ideration, by her In&s;tructions to his Excellency, our Governour, was graciou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not only to appoint &s;ome of the People call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> to be of her Maje&s;ties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Council for the Province of <HI>Nova Ce&s;aria</HI> or <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> but al&s;o gave leave and encouragement to others of them to bear Offices of Tru&s;t and Profit in the Government, which could not otherwi&s;e be effected than by Qualifying them in their own way of <HI>Affirmation.</HI> Pur&s;uant hereunto an Act of A&s;&s;embly was pa&s;&s;ed in the 13<HI>th</HI> Year of her &s;aid Maje&s;tys Reign, entituled, An Act that the &s;olemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;hall be accepted in&s;tead of an Oath in the u&s;ual Form, and for Qualifying and enabling the &s;aid People to &s;erve as Jurors, and to execute any Office or Place of Tru&s;t or Profit within this Province. By which Law, the&s;e People (being Affirmed as that Law directs) are admitted to &s;erve on all Inque&s;ts, Grand and Petty Jurys (except on petty Jurys in Cau&s;es Criminal) any Law Cu&s;tom or U&s;age to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. Our mo&s;t Gracious Soveraign Lord King <HI>George,</HI> upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, in a publick
<PB N="4" REF="001796_0004_0FB832BFF07BE168">
manner did declare, That the Indulgence and Toleration granted by Law to &s;crupu|lous Con&s;ciences, was no way incon&s;i&s;tent with the Civil and Religious Con&s;titution of the Kingdom. His Maje&s;ty has likewi&s;e renewed the Commi&s;&s;ion and confirmed his Excellency Brigadeer <HI>Hunter</HI> in the Government of this Province with the In|&s;tructions relating to the People called <HI>Quakers.</HI> And why &s;hould private Per&s;ons &s;et up for and pretend to be Wi&s;er than the Laws, Wi&s;er than their King and Gover|nours, and Wi&s;er than their Legi&s;lators? This Act of Parliament made in favour of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in the fir&s;t year of his Maje&s;ties Reign, which was &s;o of|fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iou&s;ly obtruded to the Court in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, backt with the Ra&s;h and Precipi|tant Opinions of &s;ome Gentlemen at the Bar, in my Opinion, was altogether then Mi&s;-under&s;tood and Mi&s;-interpreted by them; for it was very plainly de&s;igned as a Favour and Indulgence to all the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who were among&s;t his Maje&s;ties Subjects in all and every of his Dominions, and no manner of Re&s;traint of any Liberty and Indulgence which they then were, or might be otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thereafter. At that time (as I &s;uppo&s;e it was intended) it gave me &s;ome Sur|prize, and coming from a private hand at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> printed on a &s;mall &s;ingle Sheet, in no Statute Book of publick Laws, from no Board of Trade, Secre|tary of State, or other Officer or Mini&s;ter directed to the Governour of either this or the Neighbouring Province, the Opinion which I then gave, was, That as yet I could not take any Notice of it as a publick Law, nor give my Opinion upon it, being only a Pre&s;umptive Evidence of the being of &s;uch Law. And there being a Po&s;itive notorious Act of A&s;&s;embly of this Province for Qualifying the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> to &s;erve on Jurys of all Sorts (except in Criminal Cau&s;es) on that Affirmation, I did Order the Secretary to qualify them accordingly, which (contrary to his Duty) he po&s;i|tively Refu&s;ed to do, by means whereof, we had no Grand Jury this la&s;t Term, I did pronounce him in Contempt of the Court, and Impo&s;ed a Fine upon him for this Contempt. And now having better con&s;idered of the Sub&s;tance and Intent of this Law or Statute, I am fully prepared to give my Opinion thereof, with relation to the Inhabitants of this Divi&s;ion who are Quakers or reputed Quakers. My fir&s;t Ob|&s;ervation is, That this Paragraph of the Statute is only Negative of it &s;elf; for the Words are, Provided and be it Enacted, That no Ouaker or reputed Quaker &s;hall by virtue of <HI>This</HI> Act be Qualified or permitted to give Evidence in any Criminal Cau&s;es or &s;erve on any Jurys, or bear any Office or place of Profit in the Government, any thing in This Act contained to the contrary in any ways notwith&s;tanding. Then again, this Act of Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is an Enlargement of the Quaker Privieldge to what it never was before, It makes that perpetual to them in <HI>England,</HI> which before was Temporary, and expired or near expiring by its own Limitation; Carrys the &s;ame into that part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>Scotland,</HI> where it was not before, and makes it perpetual there; and into the Plantations generally for Five Years. This does no ways hinder, but that by virtue of the Act of A&s;&s;embly of this Province, which is a Municipal Law thereof, the Quakers or reputed Quakers are qualified to be of Jurys, and Evidence, and bear Offices of Tru&s;t and Profit in the Government; nor but that they may be &s;o qualified hereafter by any other Law hereafter to be made for that or the like purpo&s;e, Although by virtue of <HI>That</HI> Act of Parliament they are not &s;o qualified.</P>
<P>It is true, there are other inhabitants in <HI>Burlington,</HI> who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and it were to be wi&s;hed they were more numerous, and better di&s;po&s;ed towards the Government thereof, under the be&s;t of Princes, and a prudent and well de&s;erving Governour, who bears the par|ticular Marks of his Maje&s;tys Royal Favour. Can any of the&s;e &s;ay, that whil&s;t they behaved them&s;elves well, they were denyed to have the Oathes admini&s;tred to them

in due Form of Law, and their Priviledges? The promi&s;cuous Return of both &s;orts upon the Sheriffs Pannels to &s;erve on Grand Jurys, with the Differences of Parties, has been an Occa&s;ion of great Ob&s;truction to the Courts of Judicature, notwith|&s;tanding my frequent Admonitions to the contrary. I am not altogether ignorant of the Authors of tho&s;e Di&s;turbances, having been pre&s;ent at <HI>Burlington</HI> the greate&s;t part of the time of that Se&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;embly, when that Law, in Favour of the Quakers, was in Framing; the pretended Zeal for the Church, and its &s;uppo&s;ed and Imaginary Danger, with the humour of new invented Di&s;tinctions, run to a very great Height, &s;o that &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;eemed to be almo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to a total Contempt of Government, and Rebellion. I &s;hall forbear naming Per&s;ons in hopes that the&s;e ill humours are evaporated and at an end; I do be&s;eech you to be at the pains to read that Grave and &s;age Advice given by his Grace the mo&s;t Reverend Father in God <HI>Thomas</HI> late Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the other Right Honourable the Lords Bi&s;hops then in and about <HI>London,</HI> of the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, in their printed Declaration, and con&s;ider whether it is not worthy of all our Regard and Obedience. The&s;e groundle&s;s and &s;ubtil Di&s;tinctions and Jealou&s;ies, which of late had like to bring the State and Con&s;titution of the Government into Danger, are now over in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> By the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon his Maje&s;tys Arms, and his prudent Conduct; Let them not Survive here; Let us for the future Re&s;ovle to lay a&s;ide all bitter Envying and Stri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e one again&s;t another, on any Store what|&s;oever, and heartily endeavour to pre&s;erve, maintain and improve that Harmony, Love and Peace which our mo&s;t Gracious Soveraign Lord the King has given &s;uch A&s;&s;urances of to all his Loving Subjects what&s;oever. Why &s;hall Moderation and <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity</HI> be laid a&s;ide as U&s;ele&s;s, Anti-chri&s;tian and Heterodox, and <HI>Envy, Hatred</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> pa&s;s upon us for Zeal and Religion!</P>
<P>I do under&s;tand the Grand Jury of <HI>Burlington,</HI> at the la&s;t General Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, after an Unpre&s;idented manner, have found an Indictment again&s;t Me, for what I have done in the Execution of my Office upon the Bench, in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, as al&s;o Indictments again&s;t &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Figure and Di&s;tinction in the Go|vernment; Were it an Offence only again&s;t me Per&s;onally, I thank God, I could pa&s;s it by without the lea&s;t Re&s;entment; (I am ready to believe they were none of their own Framing, e&s;pecially that again&s;t my Self,) but as it is an open Affront put upon me, as I repre&s;ent the Kings Per&s;on, it de&s;erves Correction. The Law does not &s;uppo&s;e that a Judge is Infallible, and therefore he is not accountable in Law for a Mi&s;take in his Opinion; and in many ca&s;es the Judges of <HI>England</HI> are of different Opinions. And the Law provides well for the Support of the Dignity of &s;uch Per&s;ons as do repre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty in the Office of Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice. The Judgment for Striking in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, &amp;c.</HI> &s;iting the Courts, is, That the Offender &s;hall be Impri&s;oned during his Life, Forfeit all his Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chatte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and that his Right Hand be cut off at &s;uch a place; Which Judgment is given by the Common Law. It is one of the &s;pecies of High-Trea&s;on to Kill and Murder a Ju&s;tice of either Bench, in their Places doing their Offices. If any Man in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall,</HI> or in any other place, &s;itting the Courts of Chancery, Exchequer, the Kings Bench, the Common-Pleas, or before Ju&s;tice of A&s;&s;ize, or of Oyer and Ter|miner, &s;hall draw a Weapon again&s;t any Judge or Ju&s;tice, though he &s;trike not, this is a great Mi&s;pri&s;on, for the which he shall loo&s;e his Right Hand, and Forfeit his Lands and Goods, and his Body to perpetual Impri&s;onment. The Rea&s;on given for it, is, Becau&s;e it tendeth <HI>Ad Impedimentum Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s Terrae,</HI> To the Hinderance of the Law of the Land.

the Offence (which is the occa&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e) above what it is, but to &s;how you, That as in the&s;e Higher Crimes again&s;t his Maje&s;ties Ju&s;tices upon the Bench, doing their Offices, an extraordinary Puni&s;hment is to be inflicted, &s;o in &s;maller Offences committed again&s;t them, for the doing of their Duty in their Offices, the Law will proportionably require a &s;harper Reproof, than for the like Offences again&s;t Per&s;ons in a private Capacity. I shall not take upon my &s;elf to direct this Puni&s;hment, but cannot think that any of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who were of that Grand Jury, can properly &s;erve in that Tru&s;t again, until they &s;hall make Ran&s;om for that Offence, which I &s;incerely de&s;ire may be Moderated, being inclineable to believe, That none of them did compo&s;e tho&s;e Pre&s;entments, and that they were prepared to their hands.</P>

<HEAD>The Charge to the Grand Jury at <HI>Burlington,</HI> the Fir&s;t Day of <HI>May, 1716.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Would have introduced my Charge this time to the Grand Jury, by &s;aying &s;ome|what concerning the Nece&s;&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of Government, and what a great &s;hare of our <HI>Chri&s;tian Duty</HI> it is, to be &s;ubject and Obedient thereunto, and to Support it. It is a thing &s;o well known, that few will offer to di&s;pute it, yet &s;o little regarded by many, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned and urged. It is a thing &s;o Copious, more might ea&s;ily be &s;aid on that head, than my Time will now permit; <HI>I</HI> &s;hall therefore confine my &s;elf to that nervous and &s;ollid Argument of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had imbraced the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and lived under the Obedience and Government of <HI>Heathen</HI> Rulers and Magi&s;trates, <HI>chap.</HI> 13. from <HI>ver.</HI> 1. to <HI>v.</HI> 8.
<Q>Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be are ordained of God; Who&s;oever there|fore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God, and they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation; For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the Evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame; for he is the Mini&s;ter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain; for he is the Mini&s;ter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake; for for this cau&s;e pay we Tribute al&s;o; for they are Gods Mi|ni&s;ters attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</Q>
St. <HI>Peter</HI> writing to the Strangers who had imbraced the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> in his fir&s;t general Epi&s;tle, was of the &s;ame Mind, his words are.
<Q>Submit your &s;elves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords &s;ake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or to Governours, as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well; for &s;o is the Will of God.</Q></P>
<P>The Health and very Life of Government con&s;i&s;ts in the due Execution of the Laws, and this is the Prerogative of the Crown, and this the King does by his Mi|ni&s;ters and Officers, who do repre&s;ent his Per&s;on, in the due Execution of their Offices; Without this the Law is but a dead Letter. And it is for this end we are now met here. And for that we are Judges of Record, by the order of the Laws,

we cannot take Knowledge of Offences without the Information of others, and therefore, by the Kings Authority, you are called together here, according to antient Practice in <HI>England,</HI> and the former U&s;age, as Men, who by common intend|ment, do know &s;uch Offences, as we have power to deal withal, committed within the &s;everal places of your Habitations in the County of <HI>Burlington.</HI> Let there be no more Strife and Di&s;-uniting among&s;t you, on the &s;core of that mixture of Per&s;ons which the Law has allowed to &s;erve.

<P>The Service which you are now to perform, is of very great Importance; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> It concerns the Honour of God, and the Advancement of his Glory, and the Sup|pre&s;&s;ing of Satans Kingdom.

If you carefully ob&s;erve your Oath, you shall do much Good, an&s;wer all the&s;e good Ends, and be Prai&s;e Worthy; but if Contrary-wi&s;e (which I hope there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s no rea&s;on to apprehend) any of you should be Tempted to Violate your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olemn Engagement, you should draw down upon your &s;elves the Vengeance and Di&s;plea&s;ure of God, and &s;ubject your &s;elves to the Puni&s;hment of the Law.
