<HEAD>A DISSERTATION UPON ORATORY, AND Philological Inquiry, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the infancy of Society, before the darkne&s;s of barbari&s;m has been di&s;&s;ipated, every &s;tudy, the final end of which is in|tellectual improvement, is either unknown or contemned: But when refinement be|gins to dawn, then by degrees men form a reli&s;h for the more exalted &s;tudies, and, as their opportunities permit them, ex|change corporeal occupation and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, for more enlightened labours and refined delights.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="036948_0004_100B5432191B9CC0">
<P>BUT of all the intellectual &s;tudies, there are none which receive a later or &s;lighter attention than tho&s;e of Orato|ry and Philology; yet perhaps none which require more early and judicious care. If the &s;ignification of words be in|determinate, our knowledge of the things &s;ignified by them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be confu&s;ed. If our language be defective, our metaphy&s;ics may be incompatible, our logic incongruous, and our very mo|rality unintelligible, if not even ab&s;urd. And the&s;e are Sciences of them&s;elves &s;ufficiently involved in darkne&s;s, not to need any additional perplexity from the ambiguity or contradiction of language. But the attainment of per&s;picuity is not the &s;ole advantage accruing from a critical &s;tudy of language; but the beauty of ex|pre&s;&s;ion and the cogency of argument are derived in a con&s;iderable degree from the &s;ame &s;ource. It not only &s;erves to
<PB N="5" REF="036948_0005_100B5434D0B924A8">elucidate our Ideas, it directs, it improves, it inforces them. In fine, <HI>Liberty</HI> receives no le&s;s &s;upport, than Literature does energy and ornament from forcible and elegant language. If men therefore wi&s;h to di&s;|cour&s;e intelligibly, much more, if they a&s;|pire to impre&s;s conviction, or impart de|light, they &s;hould not remain unacquainted with the in&s;truments by which the&s;e effects are produced. Hence Oratory and Philolo|gy ever engaged the attention of tho&s;e who have been &s;olicitous and able to plea&s;e and to per&s;uade; and to minds &s;u&s;ceptible of every elegant impre&s;&s;ion and open to every refinement of ta&s;te, any attempt to ad|vance this knowledge can (I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e) neither be unacceptable nor unu&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036948_0006_100B5436F6B15F90">
THE Engli&s;h language labours under pe|culiar defects and enjoys peculiar excellen|cies. To have the&s;e defects and excellencies (at lea&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable of them) placed before our Eyes mu&s;t be u&s;e|ful, ina&s;much as it will &s;ugge&s;t the means of avoiding tho&s;e blemi&s;hes which di&s;grace a &s;tyle, of adopting tho&s;e beauties which en|hance it, of tranferring from foreign lan|guages tho&s;e graces wherein our own may &s;eem to be deficient, and of neglecting &s;uch innovations as have been created thro' ig|norance or caprice, and are unallied to pro|priety of &s;peech or the genius of our tongue.</P>
<P>We &s;hall con&s;ider it under the heads of Simplicity, Energy, Copiou&s;ne&s;s and grace, and endcavor to call forth into view, &s;ome of the principal beauties and defects, by impartially comparing it with tho&s;e of Greece and Rome. Should I fail in this attempt, I mu&s;t hope for indulgence; &s;hould I err, for correction.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="036948_0007_100B543920A0CC68">
<P>THE &s;ubject is important, delicate and exten&s;ive. It would be vain therefore to hope that I &s;hall e&s;cape inperfection: It is &s;ufficient for me that I &s;hall offer hints upon which &s;uperior abilities may improve.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of Oratory is particu|larly incumbent upon the ri&s;ing youth of America. The influence of the revolu|tion will give efficacy to their exertions, &s;ince where Liberty is e&s;tabli&s;hed Oratory will flouri&s;h. And not only honor, but the well being of the country demand tho&s;e exertions, &s;ince when Oratory mo&s;t generally flouri&s;hes, Liberty is mo&s;t &s;e|cure. There are circum&s;tances that now combine in their favour, with which the &s;tudents of Oratory in ancient days, &amp; even your predece&s;&s;ors in this country, were una&s;|&s;i&s;ted. I &s;incerely wi&s;h, and confidently ex|pect, that their abilities, improving the&s;e circum&s;tances, will give to this country, al|ready
<PB N="8" REF="036948_0008_100B543B43B088C8">rendered illu&s;trious, additional bril|liancy.</P>
<P>IN the &s;chool of Oratory which was in|&s;tituted under the reign of The&s;eus, the youth of abilities was taught to di&s;pute juridically and to deceive <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eti de, tanantia dei dunasthai peithein, ka|thoper kai en tois &s;ullogi&s;mois. <BIBL>Ari&s;t Rhetor.</BIBL></NOTE> as in the regu|lar form of &s;yllogi&s;m. In the Lyceum, the Portico and the Academy, where gene|rous precepts flowed from eloquent lips, the young philo&s;opher had the opportunity of li&s;tening. But now, in this ri&s;ing country, he may not only learn the accu|mulated wi&s;dom of every age, but he may learn to apply that wi&s;dom to the great purpo&s;es of life. Neither a foren&s;ic
<PB N="9" REF="036948_0009_100B543D5F94D2D8">Sophi&s;t as in the one ca&s;e, nor an indolent auditor as in the other, he is taught to emulate with active diligence tho&s;e pow|ers that once pre&s;erved Greece in the en|joyment of her liberties, and that a&s;&s;i&s;ted to re&s;cue this country.</P>
<P>IN former times the works of great ma&s;ters (which are the true models for improvement) were &s;carce and difficult of acce&s;s; but now by the happy art of Gottenburg, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inventor of Printing.</NOTE> the glowing pages not only of the Hi&s;torian <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thucydides and I&s;aeus&mdash;See Plutarch in vita Demo&s;then.</NOTE> and the orator from whom the great Athenian copied, but of the great Athenian him&s;elf and of his Roma competitor, are endowed (if I may &s;o &s;peak) with a benevolent ubiquity, by which while pre&s;ent with all, they invite all to rival them. And by the encourage|ments
<PB N="10" REF="036948_0010_100B543F8A464F60">here given to compo&s;ition, of which &s;o many &s;pecimens have lately been exhi|bited; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Upon the Death of General Wa&s;hington.</NOTE> they who are animated with the laudable ambition of excelling in that art which governs the &s;oul, in&s;lead of be|ing obliged like the orators of old to have recour&s;e for improvement to the unfaithful mirror of the cave, or to the uncon&s;cious waves of the ocean, enjoy the ine&s;timable advantage of a rational and indulgent peo|ple, to in&s;pin admire and reward their E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory &s;hould be carefully &s;tudied and we &s;hould always bear in mind its u&s;es, and direct our inve&s;tigations in &s;uch a manner, as to render our knowledge ap|plicable to purpo&s;es of practicable utility. The annals of remote antiquity are in general mere chioniclen of names and dates, which form in fact the only links
<PB N="11" REF="036948_0011_100B5441E6B26710">whereby the events they record are con|nected.</P>
<LG>
<L>Who's the Hi&s;torian? Is it he that moulds</L>
<L>And forms his matter but to &s;uit the ends</L>
<L>Of faction, and of party? Is it he</L>
<L>That, little anxious about facts, contrives</L>
<L>To flatter &s;ome great patron? Is it he</L>
<L>That rounds a period by a breach of truth,</L>
<L>And forms antithe&s;es by joining men</L>
<L>And things that never met? Or, is it he</L>
<L>That centers all the&s;e graces in himself?</L>
<L>No: 'tis the man that, undi&s;inay'd by fear,</L>
<L>Addicted to no party, &s;peaks the truth.</L>
</LG>
<P>But we ought not to be &s;atisfied with being mere Hi&s;torians. If Hi&s;tory, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cicero.</NOTE> who is the me&s;&s;enger of Antiquity, were not to be al&s;o the mi&s;tre&s;s of life, her documents would be of little u&s;e, except to divert the anxieties of the reclu&s;e Hypochondriac; her volumes would be of little value, ex|cept
<PB N="12" REF="036948_0012_100B54444BEA7DC8">to &s;well the Library of the lettered &s;peculi&s;t. But Hi&s;tory was not meant to be the &s;olace of the indolent, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tacitus.</NOTE> it is her province and her prai&s;e to be the guide of the active. Since few can by mere pru|dence di&s;tingui&s;h the ju&s;t from the preju|dicial, the u&s;eful from the dangerous: Many are taught by the events of others. Mark, however, that the in&s;tructions of hi&s;|tory are not fitted for the regulation of private intercour&s;e, but for the momen|tous admini&s;tration of public affairs. To the &s;tate&s;man and to the patriotic Orator, &s;he manife&s;ts her&s;elf the light of truth and the &s;oul of memory: To all, however in|experienced, &s;he liberally di&s;pen&s;es wi&s;|dom, and points out, with an unerring hand how they may a&s;&s;ert and defend the deare&s;t privileges of mankind. Thus it is that Hi&s;tory is &s;ub&s;ervient to Oratory,
<PB N="13" REF="036948_0013_100B5446697A4558">as Oratory is to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WITH &s;imilar recommendations, Com|po&s;ition courts attention. Nothing (&s;ays Tully, is &s;o conducive to Oratory as wri|ting. And we find that the greate&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Plutarch in vita Demo&s;thenes.</NOTE> Ora|tor the world ever produced, did not deem it unworthy his genius to &s;pend &s;everal months in a cave, in poli&s;hing a &s;peech; to tran&s;cribe Thucydides eight times, and to labour for the &s;pace of an Olympiad in imitating the orations of I&s;aeus&mdash;we mu&s;t allow ample authority to the a&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>THUS wi&s;ely did the&s;e founders provide Hi&s;tory and compo&s;ition as &s;upporters for Oratory, which may it&s;elf be &s;tyled the e&s;cutcheon of freedom. To demon&s;trate this, the annals of the world evince, that it has been by the influence of this divine
<PB N="14" REF="036948_0014_100B54488B1FA030">art, which arou&s;es, per&s;uades and in&s;pirs, that ever the oppre&s;&s;ed have been awaken|ed from their ignominious acquie&s;cence, have been taught to know the dignity of their nature, and animated with courage to a&s;&s;ert their rights. It may be u&s;eful to en|quire how this has happened.</P>
<P>FEW &s;tates have been originally free, and, what is remarkable, &s;till fewer have become free. The cau&s;e of this &s;eems to be, that Oratory, which is the in&s;trument of freedom, cannot flouri&s;h under arbitra|ry government; &s;ometimes however it may happen that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. S. Adams, General Wa&s;hington &amp;c</NOTE> one or two great and good men, endowed with abilities which fear does not repie&s;s, and animated with a love for the public good which ambition or intere&s;t cannot warp, may become ora|tors; the&s;e men may command the &s;ouls of their countrymen, and arou&s;e them to
<PB N="15" REF="036948_0015_100B544AAFA6BEE8">vindicate their native rights. This coun|try hazarded what appeared at fir&s;t ra&s;h|ne&s;s to many; but the beneficial con&s;e|quences are now very vi&s;ible to all the indu&s;trious throughout the United States. I think the Hi&s;tories of every age and of every nation concur in demon&s;trating the truth of the&s;e principles. As they are of &s;uch moment, they ought to be illu&s;trated and confirmed by applying to Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Te&s;timonies of Hi&s;tory, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, are often tedious, but they are always impartial and conclu&s;ive: And I hope that truth will be received with plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t con&s;titution which human &s;ociety knew was by no means propitious to the birth of cio|quence. The families of the Patriarchs were ruled with ab&s;olute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plato de legib. l. iii. and he adduces in cor|roboration of his opinion the Cyclopean polite, &s;ee Hom. Ody&s;s, l. i.</NOTE> authority; and
<PB N="16" REF="036948_0016_100B544CD36BC570">there was little other occa&s;ion for &s;peech than to &s;ignify the will of the aged father. Men were thus from their infancy habitu|ated to implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and when in time they found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport public ho&s;tilities, they crowded, without reluctance or compunction, around the de&s;potic banners of &s;ome illu&s;trious chief|tain.</P>
<P>SUCH was the early government of the Jews.

<P>IN Greece alone did a Democracy exi&s;t; and climate &s;eemed happily to con|&s;pire with con&s;titution to elevate the Gre|cians above the re&s;t of mankind. Le&s;s fierce than the northern Europeans, le&s;s effeminate than the A&s;iatics, they were neither always in the field like the one, nor always on the couch like the other: they had lei&s;ure and genius to in|vent arts; and wi&s;dom and courage to pro|tect them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ari&s;t. de Rep. l. vii. c. 7.</NOTE> Here it was accordingly, in the mid&s;t of Republics, that eloquence was called into exi&s;tence. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cicero de orat. l. 1. c. 5.</NOTE> And it is wor|thy of remark that where eloquence was fir&s;t known, there &s;he was mo&s;t perfect: Like the tutelary Godde&s;s of the place of her nativity, another offspring of the head, &s;he appeared con&s;umate at her birth.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="036948_0019_100B5452BA119DA8">
Examming the records of Hi&s;tory we become convinced that eloquence not only abhorred de&s;poti&s;m, but di&s;cerned and abandoned &s;uppo&s;ititious freedom. The &s;tudy of oratory (&s;aid Tully) was not com|mon to Greece, but peculiar to Athens. For who hath known an Argive, a Corin|thian or a Theban orator: unle&s;s we ex|cept Epaminondas, a man of &s;ingular ac|compli&s;hments. Or hath a Spartan orator been heard of even to this day? Lace-daemon was called a free &s;tate, but the people had no right to propo&s;e laws, nor to alter or debate upon &s;uch as the Senate would propo&s;e, and hence their con&s;tant Laconic &s;tyle. Carthage too was called a free State; but its government (as Ari&s;|totle proves) was in fact an oligarchy. At Carthage nothing was accounted ba&s;e if it &s;upplied lucre: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polybius.</NOTE> The votes of the electors were avowedly purcha&s;ed: And the peo|ple,
<PB N="20" REF="036948_0020_100B545572A272B8">who were the agents and factors of all other nations, intent as they were upon traffic, and accu&s;tomed to naval di&s;cipline, were not le&s;s regardle&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, than they were ignorant of the charms and energies of &s;peech. In &s;hort, do we wi&s;h for a criterion of genuine con|&s;titutional Freedom? enquire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diony&s;ius Halicar.</NOTE> if oratory flouri&s;hes in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>By comparing the number and &s;tyle of the Athenian orators, with the political tran&s;actions of the different periods in which they lived, it not only appears that when Athens was mo&s;t free, then were her citizens mo&s;t generally eloquent; but it is al&s;o di&s;cernable that among her great orators the excellence of each was accu|rately paralleled by the &s;pirit of indepen|dence with which he was in&s;pired. How far did Ly&s;ias, I&s;ocrates, I&s;aeus, Demo&s;|thenes
<PB N="21" REF="036948_0021_100B54579A812BE8">outvie Timaeus, So&s;igenes, Phila|grius and Molo? Among the former how inferior to the re&s;t was the mild I&s;ocrates, who&s;e very cen&s;ures were couched in panegyric, and who, if he afforded any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to liberty, did it rather by depre|cation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Oration to Philip</NOTE> than by patronage!</P>
<P>From the death of Phocion, 'till the time of Dyoni&s;ius the Halicarna&s;&s;ian (which was about the Augu&s;tan age of Rome) the original and Philo&s;ophic &s;pe|cies of eloquence <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dyony&s;. Halic</NOTE> was gradualy decaying, and in the time of Dyoni&s;ius was almo&s;t extinct. The cha&s;te and native Attic mu&s;e (&s;ays he) was de&s;poiled of her property and her re&s;pect, by the meretricious in+trigues of the Phrygian, who &s;upplanted her, and &s;educed all the cities of Greece.

<P>The &s;ubject would take up too much time to trace, with accuracy, the progre&s;s of eloquence through Greece and Rome, although new proof;s would &s;till ari&s;e in corroboration of what is here advanced.

This great di&s;&s;imilarity in the origi|nal &s;tructure of the Language nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a great diver&s;ity in the expre&s;&s;ion. The direct and immediate con&s;equences of
<PB N="43" REF="036948_0043_100B5486A4F73608">it, we find are, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor Louth's Engli&s;h Grummer.</NOTE> that in the Engli&s;h Lan|guage, &s;ub&s;tantives have but one variation of ca&s;e, whereas in the Latin they have five: Adjectives admit of no variation, ex|cept that which expre&s;&s;es the degrees of compari&s;on; and verbs do not undergo above five or &s;ix mutations from their ori|ginal form, though in &s;ome Languages they undergo as many hundreds. The&s;e peculiarities in the formation of the Eng|li&s;h Language &s;ufficiently diver&s;ify it from almo&s;t every other: For though there are many modern Languages, who&s;e inflexions do not much exceed ours in point of num|ber, yet there is none wherein the&s;e defi|ciencies are &s;o adequately &s;upplied, nor is there, perhaps, any language, the &s;tructure of which is altogether &s;o &s;imple as ours.

<PB N="44" REF="036948_0044_100B548973B61150">qualities in a Language, yet if they ex|clude other advantages of a more impor|tant and requi&s;ite nature, our endeavors &s;hould rather be directed to add to its com|plication, than to continue the exclu&s;ion of more favorable acce&s;&s;ions. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t important that &s;eems to be incompati|ble with &s;uch plain &s;implicity, is Melody of Language; an acqui&s;ition of too happy utility not to be &s;trongly de&s;irable, and who&s;e lo&s;s, &s;implicity of &s;tructure alone can never compen&s;ate.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems then that to this cau&s;e has been owing in a great mea&s;ure that va&s;t multi|tude of mono&s;yllables wherewith our lan|guage
<PB N="45" REF="036948_0045_100B548B9A28FDB0">abounds: a circum&s;tance which will be found hereafter very prejudicial to melody. As the final &s;yllables of our words remain unvaried, the advantages which in other languages re&s;ult from in|flexion, are procured with us by auxiliary mono&s;yllables. Many of the&s;e are of an uncouth and awkward pronunciation: and particularly incommodious, for this rea|&s;on, that their quantity is indi&s;tinctly, if at all marked, whereby their pronuncia|tion is un&s;ettled and wavering; and above all, ungraceful in ver&s;ification, where yet their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is very often indi&s;pen&s;ibly required. But the zeal of our ance&s;tors to pre&s;erve their language in its original Teutonic form, con&s;piring with its own pronene&s;s, has added &s;till more to this defect, by their etymological deductions. They imagined the introduction of poly|&s;yllables would have been an unpardona|ble innovation; but yet perceiving the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying them&s;elves with
<PB N="46" REF="036948_0046_100B548D225ACCC0">terms to denote tho&s;e combinations of ideas which the Romans had taught them to form, they contracted the Roman words into as conci&s;e a pronunciation as po&s;&s;ible; and thus though they naturali|zed them, yet they entirely dive&s;ted them of their primitive harmony, and cloath|ed them in the rugged har&s;hne&s;s of their own ta&s;te. Many examples which illu&s;|trate the ju&s;tice of this ob&s;ervation may be &s;een in Doctor Wallis; I &s;hall ju&s;t mention a few; <HI>&s;cape</HI> from <HI>excipio, &s;tretch'd</HI> from <HI>extractum, &s;cour</HI> from <HI>exco|rio, mend</HI> from <HI>emendo.</HI> I think, that, though the puerency of Doctor Wallis's imagination occa&s;ioned him &s;ometimes to &s;tretch his derivations too far, yet his final deductions are generally founded in rea&s;on and rea&s;son truth.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e cau&s;es combining with acci|dent, and perhaps re&s;ulting from the phlegmatic &s;implicity of the original form|ers,
<PB N="47" REF="036948_0047_100B548F5DFA35A8">have be&s;towed on our language that &s;uperabundance of mono&s;yllables, of which we complain as &s;o injurious to melody. That this effect mu&s;t en&s;ue is evident; in &s;ome ca&s;es no doubt mono&s;yllables may be arranged to advantage; but it is no le&s;s indubitable that their general tenden|cy is to ob&s;truct the run of a period, to render it rough and uneven, and to inter|cept the melodious flow of the cadence. And this I take to be one principal cau&s;e why our periods are frequently de&s;titute of that &s;moothne&s;s and harmony, which &s;o eminently characterize, and &s;o engagingly adorn tho&s;e of the ancients. Another no le&s;s remarkable cau&s;e, however, contributed to this; which I &s;hall mention here as it may enable us to a&s;certain how far the former operates. I mean the &s;uperior op|portunities the ancients had of modulating their &s;tyle by inver&s;ion. For as the rela|tions and dependencies of words in a &s;en|tence were expre&s;&s;ed among them by &s;imi|larity
<PB N="48" REF="036948_0048_100B54926BDFF6D0">of termination (a mode equally free from ob&s;curity and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion) they were at liberty to tran&s;po&s;e their words in &s;uch an order as was mo&s;t aptly accommo|dated to their varieties of length and tone; but we, having no adequate equiva|lent to this, are obliged to depend upon juxta po&s;ition alone, which, though perhaps the mo&s;t natural, is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Kaims.</NOTE> confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t inconvenient method, &s;ince it deprives us, in a great mea&s;ure, of the benefit of tran&s;po|&s;ition, which be&s;ides improving the har|mony, adds much to the dignity, force and elevation of a period.&mdash;Still as we &s;trutinize the Engli&s;h language, new cau&s;es pre&s;ent them&s;elves of its e&s;&s;ential defect in melody: and &s;till ari&s;ing in the chief part from the peculiar form of its &s;tructure.</P>
<P>THE next that appears is a &s;uperabun|dance of <HI>Con&s;onants</HI>: A due proportion of vowels and con&s;onants &s;eems as nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="49" REF="036948_0049_100B5494922C1D68">as of high and low notes in mu&s;ic, to|wards the production of melody.</P>
<P>The antient Languages are excellent in this re&s;pect; the coalitions of &s;oft and rough form a melodious equanimity of &s;ound, which renders the pronouciation ea&s;y and mu&s;ical; whereas in our language an a&s;perity of &s;ound and a roughne&s;s of tone predominate, which indicate &s;ome|thing repugnant to delicacy, and very often render the expre&s;&s;ion inadequate to the idea; &s;o, that &s;hould the one endea|vor to excite the refined and delicate feel|ings, the other may counteract its de&s;ign, and repul&s;e them by its &s;everity. This latter defect appears to owe its origin to the multiplicity of mono&s;yllables, before remarked.</P>
<P>FOR we may perceive that in a mono|&s;yllable one vowel is generally &s;ufficient to give utterance to four or five, and
<PB N="50" REF="036948_0050_100B54961AC71270">&s;ometimes even to &s;ix or &s;even con&s;onants, &s;o that the &s;ound of each may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, as for in&s;tance, <HI>grunt, drudg'd &s;natch'd, &s;tretch'ts.</HI> But in words of a greater length, as &s;ufficient lei&s;ure cannot be afforded to dwell &s;o long on each par|ticular &s;yllable as would be requi&s;ite to articulate many con&s;onants, therefore the mixture of vowels and con&s;onants mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more equal, and of cour&s;e, more uniform and harmonious: Thus, for in&s;tance, compare the&s;e words with the foregoing, <HI>Magnanimity, Reiterate, Antici|pation.</HI> But as words of the former &s;pecies are infinitely more numerous in our lan|guage than of the latter, it is plain how hard and rough mu&s;t be our pronunciation, and evident from whence it proceeds. It has been ob&s;erved, however, by a learned Critic, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Ward in his Treati&s;e on Oratory.</NOTE> that what we have deemed a defects, is in rea|lity
<PB N="51" REF="036948_0051_100B5498E80B8E70">an acce&s;&s;ion of value; for the ob&s;erves (and judiciou&s;ly) that where a language like the Italian abounds in vowels, the &s;ound of it mu&s;t be &s;oft, effeminate and languid, where|as a predominancy of con&s;onants be&s;tows &s;ublimity, energy and animation. But this can only relate to their equal and propor|tional inter&s;per&s;ion through every part of language; and I fear that when they come in the que&s;tionable &s;hape in which they vi&s;it our tongue, the&s;e effects may be doubted or denied: Their mode of con|veyance &s;eems better adapted to impedi|ment than to animation; to laconic di&s;|&s;onance than to energetic maje&s;ty: and to the production of almo&s;t any other cha|racter than that of &s;ublime and &s;onorous.

<P>THUS we have endeavoured to trace by its &s;everal channels that inharmoniou&s;ne&s;s with which our language labours, and we find that the &s;implicity of its formation is the ultimate &s;ource. And indeed when
<PB N="54" REF="036948_0054_100B549F5687D668">we compare our language with tho&s;e of Greece and Rome, in re&s;pect of this cir|cum&s;tance, we find the greate&s;t rea&s;on to deplore our inferiority. The a&s;cendancy &s;eems not only to have been mea&s;ured out to them from the beginning, along with the genius of their tongue, but al&s;o to have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and regularly en|crea&s;ed through their diligence in acquir|ing adventitious acce&s;&s;ions. As we are in a great mea&s;ure deprived of one of the&s;e &s;ources of advantage, it more immediately behoves us to apply with attention to ex|tract improvement from the other: I mean from our own diligence, nor will it be &s;o unworthily employed: To harmonize the diction, to attune the di&s;cordance of &s;tyle, and above all to accommodate the expre&s;|&s;ion to the feelings of the heart, cannot certainly be unworthy motives to atten|tion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longinus a&s;cribes Aill greater advantages to it&mdash;Section 39.</NOTE> Nor can they be e&s;teemed &s;o by the

Di&s;coveries no doubt may be made in Philo&s;ophy by a &s;tranger to the elegancies of language, and com|mon tran&s;actions may be negociated by the illiberal. But he to whom the trea&s;ures of the under&s;tanding are dear, who wi&s;hes to expand his intellectual powers, and to comprehend the cogency of his &s;peech; who &s;eeks to convey information in the vehicle of delight, and who de&s;ires to partake tho&s;e plea&s;ures which imagina|tion &s;ugge&s;ts; he, I &s;ay, mu&s;t not neglect the harmony of language, nor e&s;teem &s;uch philological inquiries unworthy.&mdash; The beauties of native harmony which al|ready &s;ub&s;i&s;t are comparatively but &s;ew, and of trifling importance, there yet re|mains an exten&s;ive field for the ingenuity and &s;agacity of the reformer; and the
<PB N="56" REF="036948_0056_100B54A3E0EC9AA8">Engli&s;h language, from the imperfection of not only this, but of mo&s;t other branches, &s;eems (&s;o far from being on the decline) not yet to have attaine the previous &s;um|mit of perfection&mdash;It &s;eems however to be &s;peedily verging towards it. As to the pre excellencies in re&s;pect of harmony which the Engli&s;h enjoys over the ancient languages, their paucity renders them in|&s;ignificant; yet there are &s;ome that &s;hould be ob&s;erved. We frequently accent the la&s;t &s;yllable, which be&s;ides inducing the advantages and beauties that re&s;ult from rhyme (of which the ancient languages are <HI>for this rea&s;on</HI> incapable) renders the pronunciation even in pro&s;e, more lively and mu&s;ical, and tends to produce that re|gular and equable proportion of accents which &s;mooths the period, promotes the delivery, and adorns the cadence. Ano|ther advantage of our language above the Roman is, that a great part of their words
<PB N="57" REF="036948_0057_100B54A60DE94F50">end in <HI>m,</HI> a broad and hollow &s;ound; but the generality of Engli&s;h words find their termination either in <HI>n</HI> or <HI>y,</HI> &s;ounds which are evidently more efficient of melody.</P>
<P>The next important contingency of lan|guage, and which conduces in a principal degree to con&s;titute its character, is <HI>&s;ignifi|cancy</HI>; a quality which though perhaps more ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to language than the preceding, yet has been thus far po&s;t|poned, as not &s;eeming to be &s;o intimately connected with its peculiarity of &s;tructure, And under this head our language a&s;|&s;umes a more re&s;pectable and flouri&s;hing appearance: Its peculiar energy and force of expre&s;&s;ion have ju&s;tly been the &s;ubject of admiration and prai&s;e: to &s;ay it equals the Greek is no exaggerated commenda|tion; but its &s;uperiority over every other language (except perhaps the Hebrew) admits not of a doubt. The recency of
<PB N="58" REF="036948_0058_100B54A7995A8250">its exi&s;tence has perhaps contributed to this in no &s;mall degree. There remain but few traces of the old Saxon, upon which it was grafied: the Greek, the Roman, the Norman, nay even the Ita|lian and the Dutch, have poured in &s;uch plentiful &s;upplies, as to render it rather the heir of many families, than the here|ditary de&s;cendant of a &s;ingle lineage.&mdash; The Tutonic and Roman languages were its original parents, but it has culled the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and energetic &s;ounds not only from them, but almo&s;t from every other with who&s;e people the Engli&s;h had any intercour&s;e. In &s;hort it is like the &s;tatue of Zeuxis, in which were com|bined the excellencies of the principal beauties of Greece. But be&s;ide this hap|pine&s;s which we owe to the &s;ingular judg|ment of our predece&s;&s;ors, and which uni|ver&s;ally pervades our language and may be exemplified in almo&s;t every word we
<PB N="59" REF="036948_0059_100B54AA63EC6170">utter, there are &s;ome other in&s;tances of &s;ignificancy which may admit a more par|ticular illu&s;tration. Of the&s;e the princi|pal is that ob&s;erved by doctor Lowth, oc|ca&s;ioned by its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing two articles, whereby the extent of the &s;ignification is determined with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE is another extrin&s;ical in&s;tance of the energy and &s;ignificancy of our lan|guage (which I &s;hall ju&s;t mention, as it has been de&s;canted upon by other writers;) that is its capacity, in common with the Greek, of forming a compound adjective, by uniting an adjective and a &s;ub&s;tantive or adverb, as <HI>fair-haired youth, ro&s;y-fin-gered Aurora, dark-minded doemon, lack-lu&s;tre eye, quaint-eyed vi&s;age, &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e combinations, of which the Roman lan|guage is by no means &s;o <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Latin examples&mdash;Verbi potens &s;acerdos&mdash;Auri|comum rus&mdash;&amp;c.</NOTE> generally &s;u&s;cep|tible, have a beautiful effect when formed

<Q>Dixais egregie notum &s;i callida verbum. Reddi|derit junctura novum. <BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, that the general tenor of our language far exceeds the La|tin in re&s;pect of &s;ignificancy, yet it &s;eems to be inferior in &s;ome few particulars; as for in&s;tance in diminutives, &s;uch as homun|culus, animula, vagula, &amp;c. which abound very much in that language, and are al|ways extremely beautiful: in ours, diminu|tives are very infrequent, I can reckon only a few, but they are &s;uch as confirm, in the livelie&s;t manner, the opinion of a deficiency; &s;treamlet, eaglet, flowrer, hi&s;|lock, lambkin, hamlet, droplet, nymphlin.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e a great delicacy in
<PB N="61" REF="036948_0061_100B54AEB88F2040">&s;everal verbs and nouns compounded of the prepo&s;ition &s;ub, which &s;erves to di|mini&s;h the force of the words with which it is connected; as &s;ubru&s;ticus, &s;ubraucus, &s;ubira&s;ci, &amp;c.&mdash;we have &s;omething analo|gous to this in our termination in <HI>i&s;h,</HI> as blacki&s;h, &s;alti&s;h, &amp;c. which, as Doctor John&s;on ob&s;erves, when applied to adjec|tives, dimini&s;hes the compari&s;on &s;omewhat below the po&s;itive; but this diminution is far inferior, both in point of &s;ervice and beauty to the Latin; for, as the &s;ame writer continues, it is &s;eldom added but to words expre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;ible qualities, and mo&s;tly of one &s;yllable; and is &s;carcely u&s;ed in a &s;tyle that is &s;olemn or &s;ublime.</P>
<P>THE Latin verbs frequentatives; as &s;crip|tito, declamito, have al&s;o a peculiar grace: to the&s;e, Engli&s;h verbs exhibit nothing analogous. Such beauties as the&s;e, not depending upon any original texture of language, but merely upon accidental and
<PB N="62" REF="036948_0062_100B54B0468309B8">&s;upervenient cau&s;es, are ea&s;ily imitable. To transfer them directly from one lan|guage to another may be too har&s;h a pro|ceeding: but when the principles of beau|ty are once e&s;tabli&s;hed, particular illu&s;tra|tions continually pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The mind, among&s;t the perpetual vici&s;&s;itude of objects which pa&s;s in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before it, will naturally attract and combine tho&s;e that tend to excite the feelings once re|marked. And though the attainment of excellence may &s;ometimes be previous to the knowledge of what con&s;titutes that quality, yet &s;uch an ab&s;tract, or general knowledge, nece&s;&s;arily predi&s;po&s;es the mind to &s;elect and dwell upon particular in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>THERE is another light in which lan|guages are capable of being compared, I mean in re&s;pect of their <HI>copiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And this is a &s;ubject which demands our atten|tion equally for its Philo&s;ophical as its Phi|lological
<PB N="63" REF="036948_0063_100B54B26A244CB0">importance. Here it is that the deepe&s;t marks of the genius and propen|&s;ities of a people are impre&s;&s;ed; their manners are delineated by this expre&s;&s;ive peneil, which only pourtrays the truth; for never does impartial language expa|tiate or amplify upon &s;ubjects uncongenial to the di&s;po&s;ition of its nation. The de|licate luxuries of the Per&s;ian were inex|pre&s;&s;ible in the language of the hardy Scythian: The political or foren&s;ic dialect of an Athenian was jargon to the heedle&s;s and peaceful inhabitant of Arcadia: while the meandering rills, the verdant lawns and the &s;hady bowers of a &s;hepherd were ju&s;t as ineffable by the &s;torm-borne citizen of Carthage</P>

In &s;hort, the arguments which probability and moral certainty furni&s;h for hi&s;torical deductions, are no where more exuberant than in the copiou&s;ne&s;s of lan|guage. And though a regular applica|tion profe&s;&s;edly for this de&s;ign would be laborious, tedious, and perhaps in the

<P>IN copiou&s;ne&s;s of words and univer&s;ality of expre&s;&s;ion, the Engli&s;h far exceeds not only the ancient, but even the modern languages.

THAT the language of <HI>Greece</HI> &s;hould be found inadequate to the fulne&s;s of mo|dern knowledge is not to be wondered at, con&s;idering the early period of its exi&s;t|ence: It &s;hould rather excite our admira|tion to find a people perpetually involved in dome&s;tic feuds and external wars, mak|ing &s;o rapid a proficiency in literary im|provement; and by their application and happy genius, attaining a knowledge of which their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were too indolent even to receive information.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, however, though they redound to the honor of Greece, yet infer &s;uch a deficiency in her acquirements, as plainiy declare her language incomplete in point of copiou&s;ne&s;s. The Greek is a very polite or affectionate language; the mode of addre&s;s is always in the &s;uperlative degree; as <HI>Philtate, Belti&s;te,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT is to modern times alone that we are
<PB N="72" REF="036948_0072_100B54C7542B3158">to look for a language fraught with all the in&s;truments of knowledge: And where &s;hould we more naturally expect to meet with &s;uch a one, than in that country which has produced the mo&s;t illu&s;trious adepts in every intellectual &s;cience?</P>
<P>AFTER allowing the&s;e encomiums to the Engli&s;h language which it &s;o ju&s;tly merits, it is &s;omewhat irk&s;ome to de&s;cend to ani|madver&s;ion. But there is one in&s;tance, which however trivial, yet appears &s;o &s;trik|ing a deviation from its general character, that it would be partiality not to mention it. Amid the unbounded richne&s;s and luxu|riancy of our tongue, one word, <HI>Love,</HI> &s;eems to &s;tand without any &s;ynonimous or appropinquating expre&s;&s;ion. The ardour of lovers generally &s;urmounts this ob&s;tacle by the re&s;ource of Tropes and Figures: But &s;trictly &s;peaking, though there are a thou&s;and different modifications of this pa&s;&s;ion, and a thou&s;and different degrees

<P>IT has often been &s;aid that our attention &s;hould not be arre&s;ted by words, but &s;hould be fixed on things; that grammati|cal di&s;qui&s;itions are puerile contentions; and &s;uch like common-place contumelies again&s;t philological inve&s;tigations. But can any one re&s;lect for a moment, without acknowledging, that our thoughts can nei|ther be &s;atisfactorily adju&s;ted, nor correct|ly imparted, unle&s;s we po&s;&s;e&s;s words aptly accommodated to them; and con&s;equently that the improvement of language mu&s;t ever keep pace with the progre&s;s of the under&s;tanding. Language is the attire in
<PB N="74" REF="036948_0074_100B54CB0A62A160">which knowledge mu&s;t be cloathed: and, like our bodily ve&s;ture, may either en|cumber, di&s;gui&s;e, and ob&s;cure it, or may di&s;tingui&s;h its rank, di&s;play its &s;trength, and enhance its native beauty.</P>
<P>IT is the duty of philology to interpo&s;e for the welfare of mankind. The in|fluence of language upon thought has, in all ages and countries, been con&s;iderable. Poverty of language circum&s;cribes the flight of ideas: inaccuracy of expre&s;&s;ion precludes preci&s;ion of thought, and equi|vocal words generate erroneous opinions.</P>
<P>THE ancients, e&s;pecially the Greeks and Romans, took con&s;iderable pains to poli&s;h and improve their languages; and in modern times &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed men in England and France have not di&s;dained to employ their talents in the &s;ame way. And if propriety of &s;peech be worthy of &s;uch attention when we

<P>AFTER having fir&s;t attended to our language, which is naturally entitled to pur chief regard, our next attention &s;hould be turned to that, by means of which the intercour&s;e of the learned in different parts of the world is mo&s;t generally upheld.&mdash;</P>

<PB N="82" REF="036948_0082_100B54DC996AD9E8">regulation of our conduct; where congre|gations have been continually wearied with ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, which &s;eldom &s;atisfies the mo&s;t learned, and rather &s;ilences, than convinces the enquiring mind; where men have endeavored to explain my&s;teries, &s;ome of which are inexplicable, and others not to be under&s;tood, but by per&s;evering &s;tudy; the con&s;equence has been, that many have been driven into di&s;gu&s;t from li&s;tening to preachers, from whom they could reap no advantage, and others have been induced to view chri&s;tianity rather as a &s;y&s;tem of &s;peculative opinions, than as a religion, the be&s;t calculated to promote the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>

<PB N="83" REF="036948_0083_100B54DE244B4280">benevolence and peace. All the genius and learning of the heathen world; all the penetration of Pythagoras, Socrates and Ari&s;totle, had never been able to pro|duce &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of moral duty, and &s;o rational an account of providence and of man, as are to be found in the new te&s;ta|ment. Chri&s;tian charity, which ought to regulate mens di&s;po&s;itions, &s;hould be in|culcated from the pulpit, as the ba&s;is of order and happine&s;s among mankind; for the po&s;itive and contentious, the rude and quarrel&s;ome (whether preachers or hearers) are the pe&s;t of &s;ociety. How ami|able appears a good di&s;po&s;ition, when con|tra&s;ted with a malicious or envious one, which wraps it&s;elf up in its own narrow intere&s;t, looks with an evil eye on the &s;ucce&s;s of another, and, with an unnatural &s;atisfaction, feeds on his di&s;appointments or mi&s;eries: If mankind would be happy, let them guard again&s;t this malignant &s;pirit:

<P>THE natural weakne&s;s of the human mind, has rendered it at all times &s;u&s;cep|tible of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which free-thinkers and athei&s;ts have arfully attempt|ed: And the ignorant and un&s;u&s;piciou: have too often been deluded by the mo&s;t abominable doctrines, conveyed under a &s;ubtile di&s;gui&s;e. To prevent con&s;equences &s;o de&s;tructive to the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of mankind, nothing &s;eems more nece&s;&s;ary or effectual, than the cultivation of knowledge, through every rank of life: <HI>That</HI> kind of knowledge particular|ly, which may convey to the mind &s;atis|factory

<P>To be convinced that there is a God, to us invin&s;ible, who&s;e exalted nature is far beyond the finite comprehen&s;ion of man; it is requi&s;ite that we acquire &s;ome humiliating ideas of our&s;elves, and avoid the wretched error of tho&s;e who, attribut|ing too much to human rea&s;on, deny the exi&s;tence of every thing they cannot un|der&s;tand.</P>
<P>THE narrow limits of our under&s;tand|ing, and the boundle&s;s perfection of the deity, are no uncommon &s;ubjects of pul|pit eloquence: The facts are often pre&s;&s;ed upon our minds, and frequently (it mu&s;t be hoped) have the proper effect. Some|thing more, however, there &s;eems yet ne|ce&s;&s;ary toward the conviction of mankind, which might reach more generally the dif|ferent cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety&mdash;guard them

<P>THE church is the only &s;chool where the public mind can be &s;aid to be culti|vated, and its morals formed; and where we are to learn the nece&s;&s;ary duties towards our creator and each other. Even here, &s;ome divines &s;eem too inattentive to &s;ub|jects of the fir&s;t importance&mdash;they apply them&s;elves principally to the con&s;ideration of moral truth, and ethical &s;y&s;tems, that teach men tho&s;e common duties in &s;ociety, which even con&s;cience it&s;elf will dictate: but the belief of a Deity on which the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of religion and vir|tue mu&s;t be founded, is taken for granted, or &s;carcely ever inforced.</P>
<P>IT may be an&s;wered, that &s;ubjects which require a mode of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion above the comprehen&s;ion of common capacities, are
<PB N="87" REF="036948_0087_100B54E7CBB17C08">not the mo&s;t eligible for the pulpit; and that the exi&s;tence of a Deity, being the fir&s;t principle of a Chri&s;tian's creed, needs no enquiry before a Chri&s;tian congrega|tion. But how often is the mind found to give its a&s;&s;ent to propo&s;itions without proof? and though youth follow the ex|ample and per&s;ua&s;ion of their parents, how little acquainted mu&s;t they really be, with the true principles of their faith, until they arrive at a maturity of judg|ment, capable of di&s;criminating between truth and delu&s;ion? Nay we may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that this imperfect degree of know|ledge is a misfortune attendant on far the greate&s;t part of mankind; and if &s;o, how liable mu&s;t they be to impo&s;itions? How ea&s;ily &s;haken in their belief? How readily led from a &s;tate of ignorance to that of &s;ceptici&s;in, and from thence to infidelity? But as it is the <HI>fool</HI> who &s;ays in his heart there is no God, &s;o the more our know|ledge
<PB N="88" REF="036948_0088_100B54E95358E950">is encrea&s;ed, our minds improved, and our faculties extended, the more per|manent will be our belief of that impor|tant truth: that the Deity, though invi&s;i|ble to the mortal eye, is yet perceivable to the rational mind, in <HI>the&s;e his lower works.</HI></P>
<P>LET us remark that the mo&s;t &s;atisfac|tory evidence, the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of a divine being, are deducible from our &s;en&s;es; every object affords this proof; all nature demon&s;trates the God of na|ture; and it is only nece&s;&s;ary to lead the mind to a proper coutemplation of the&s;e objects, by di&s;covering to it &s;ome of tho&s;e peculiar properties that before lay unob|&s;erved, and it mu&s;t yield to the propo&s;ition unequivocal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>RIGHTLY therefore has the Apo&s;tle a&s;|&s;erted that the invi&s;ible things of God (whereby he means his eternal power and
<PB N="89" REF="036948_0089_100B54EB6E3963A8">Godhead) are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the things which are made.&mdash; Unfortunately indeed all mankind are not equally capable of di&s;covering the nature of Gods works; and therefore they do not alike perceive his infinite power and wi&s;dom. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of that in|&s;truction, as the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and e&s;&s;en|tial to the &s;upport of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>NOTHING can enlarge the mind more, than an exten&s;ive view of the works of God. He who be&s;t knows the de&s;ign and effect of things, will mo&s;t clearly di&s;co|ver their cau&s;e; and he who is acquaint|ed with the wi&s;dom, order, harmony, and u&s;e of the &s;everal parts of this &s;ublu|nary &s;y&s;tem will &s;oon cry out, "The&s;e are thy glorious works, Parent of good?" THOUGH the pulpit perhaps is not &s;o well calculated for arguments of this kind, yet the mini&s;ters &s;hould make &s;uch
<PB N="90" REF="036948_0090_100B54ED8E2BEE00">attempts among&s;t their hearers, and it would redound to the prai&s;e of this country, that whil&s;t other people are in&s;ulting, and even dethroning, the maje&s;ty of God, they were anxious to pre&s;erve the knowledge of him, without which we de&s;erve not the name of men.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible much more might be &s;aid on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, but I would not intrude upon your time and patience: An abler pen may perhaps improve the&s;e hints.</P>
<P>IT is to be &s;incerely hoped and wi&s;hed, that the fa&s;cinating arts of oratory may attain perfection among the ri&s;ing genera|tion of tho&s;e wide extended &s;tates, and I tru&s;t that yet I may be a witne&s;s of that improvement, which from every au&s;pice there is rea&s;on to fore&s;ee.
