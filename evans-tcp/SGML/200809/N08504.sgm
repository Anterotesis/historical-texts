<P>_THIS is the Word of the Lord God to all people this Day, this lies not in airy profe&s;&s;ion, and in vain Imigination, and what&s;oever el&s;e it is that you deck your &s;elves withal; you mu&s;t every particular Man and Woman be born again, el&s;e you cannot en|ter

into the Kingdom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Chri&s;t in that prepared Body, wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> that &s;tanding Doctrine to this Moment of time, and will be &s;o while any Man breathes upon the Earth; there is no other Way, no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <HI>Regeneration.</HI> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to &s;et forward from Earth to Heaven, all being driven out of Paradi&s;e by the Cherubim &s;et with a flaming Sword, there is no returning to that ble&s;&s;ed Life, but by the Lo&s;s of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cau&s;e Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of Return again but by this new Birth. As you are all driven and forced out <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are &s;et to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, &s;o you mu&s;t return into the favour of God again, by the Light of Chri&s;t; and you have Line upon Line, Pre|cept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. As the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> was made a living Soul, &s;o the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> is a quickening Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickened, and rai&s;ed up into the Life of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> till the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> be taken away from them.</P>
<P>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a &s;lain people to the Life of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> in which Life there was a working of the My&s;tery of Iniquity in every
<PB N="7" REF="010874_0004_0F851BD2EFB564E8">
Part of Man. One cries, lo! here is Chri&s;t, another, lo! there is Chri&s;t, and every one is following his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is &s;till but the vain Spirit of Man, running and &s;triving to recover him&s;elf; and this is the Cau&s;e there is &s;o much Profe&s;&s;ion of God, and &s;o little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be regenerated, you mu&s;t come to the Light of Chri&s;t, there is no other Way to it. He will &s;earch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and &s;et your Sins in order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compa&s;s you about; therefore you mu&s;t &s;ee your &s;elves a lo&s;t Peo|ple, a &s;inful People, and &s;o come to feel the Weight of your Sins upon your Con&s;ciences, there is no other Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, 'till you have a Trumpet &s;ounding in your Ears, to awaken you, that you may ari&s;e from the dead, that Chri&s;t may give you Light; there is no other Way, dear People, you mu&s;t bring your Deeds to the Light of Chri&s;t, and abide in the Sentence of Condemnation: If you &s;ave your Lives, you lo&s;e them; if you Will lo&s;e your Lives for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, Chri&s;t's Forerunner, declared, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of who&s;e Shoes I am not worthy to unloo&s;e, he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire, who&s;e Fan is in his Hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and
<PB N="8" REF="010874_0005_0F851BD3A555E068">
will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable Fire.</HI> What is it the bet|ter for you to read the Scripture, if you know not this fiery Bapti&s;m, which all mu&s;t know that are re|generated; deceive not your &s;elves, Chri&s;t will <HI>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and</HI> that <HI>obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;tand here as a Witne&s;s of the Lord of Life this Day, there is no Way for People to come to Salvation, but they mu&s;t know Chri&s;t revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but rendering Vengeance upon the carnal Mind, &s;elf-plea&s;ing, and all inordinate Affection; he comes with Vengeance to take away thy Life&mdash; he will baptize thee with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire. If thou knowe&s;t not this, thou art not a true Chri&s;tian, thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph.</P>
<P>If thou live&s;t at home in the Body, and flye&s;t for thy Life, and wilt not be willing to lo&s;e thy Life for Chri&s;t, if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt not have Chri&s;t to wa&s;h thee (&s;ome for Shyne&s;s, and &s;ome for &s;elf Love will refu&s;e this) if Chri&s;t doth not wa&s;h thee thou ha&s;t no part in him; you mu&s;t come to Chri&s;t to purify you in the Fiery Furnace; <HI>the Day of the Lord &s;hall burn as an oven,</HI> (as the prophet &s;peaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Venge|ance, the Day of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who redeem|eth his People from their Sins, <HI>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and e&s;tabli&s;hed with Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010874_0005_0F851BD3A555E068">Do not make the Way to Heaven ea&s;ier in your Minds and Imaginations than indeed it is, and think it not &s;ufficient to live in an outward Ob&s;ervance of the Ways of God.

and to deck thy &s;elf with them, thou can'&s;t not be &s;aved without the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. What &s;aith thy Con&s;cience, art thou brought to this Change of thy Mind, and of thy Conver&s;ati|on? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your Pride and Haughtine&s;s? Are you willing to part with your vile Affection?

<HEAD>A Short Account of the LIFE, and CONVINCEMENT, of <HI>WILLIAM DEWSBURY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IN the Year 1688, died <HI>William Dew&s;bury,</HI> one of the fir&s;t Preachers among tho&s;e cal|led <HI>Quakers,</HI> having been a very zealous Teacher, and an eminent.

He was born in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and in his Youth was a Shepherd, and afterwards put <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a Clothier; but when the civil Wars broke out, he became a Soldier, and joined with tho&s;e who &s;aid they fought for the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Now though he was religious according to his Knowledge, yet growing more and more &s;erious, and turning his Mind inwardly, he &s;aw there were inward and &s;piritual Enemies to encounter with, according to the Saying of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>We wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood; but again&s;t &s;piritual Wick|edne&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> And this State was inwardly mani|fe&s;ted to him in the words of our Saviour, <HI>put up thy Sword into the Sheath.&mdash;If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight.</HI> This wrought &s;o powerfully upon his Mind, that he could no longer

meddle with martial Affairs, but left the Army, and returned to his former Calling; endeavouring to improve in true Godline&s;s, in which he &s;o advanced gradually, that when <HI>George Fox</HI> in the Year 1651, came to <HI>Balby</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and preached the Go&s;pel there, he could not but con&s;ent to the Doctrine de|clared by him, as being the &s;ame of which he him|&s;elf was already convinced in his Mind, <HI>viz.</HI> that Heed ought to be given to the inward divine Re|provings for that which is evil; which Doctrine was preached by <HI>George Fox</HI> under the Denominati|on of <HI>the true Light, which enlighteneth every Man coming into the World.</HI> And that Heed mu&s;t be given thereunto, as being <HI>the Grace which brings Salvation,</HI> of which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Titus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 11. &s;aying, <HI>that it hath appeared to all Men. &mdash;W.
