<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CUSTOMS</HI> generally approved, and <HI>Opinions</HI> received by Youth from their Superiors, become like the natural Produce of a Soil, e&s;pecially when they are &s;uited to fa|vourite Inclinations: But as the Judgments of God are without Partiality, by which the State of the Soul mu&s;t be tried, it would be the highe&s;t Wi&s;dom to forego Cu&s;toms and popular Opinions, and try the Trea&s;ures of the Soul by the infallible Standard <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NATURAL Affection</HI> needs a careful Ex|amination: Operating upon us in a &s;oft Man|ner; <HI>it</HI> kindles De&s;ires of Love and Tender|ne&s;s, and there is Danger of taking it for &s;omething higher. To me it appears an In&s;tinct like that which inferior Creatures have; each of them, we &s;ee, by the Ties of Nature, love <HI>Self</HI> by; that which is a Part of <HI>Self</HI> they
<PB REF="007341_0003_102B5B98E35B6C10">
love by the &s;ame Tie or In&s;tinct. In them it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure does the Offices of Rea&s;on, by which, among other Things, they watchfully keep, and orderly feed their helple&s;s Offspring. Thus <HI>Natural Affection</HI> appears to be a Branch of <HI>Self-love,</HI> good in the Animal Race, in us likewi&s;e, with proper Limitati|ons; but otherwi&s;e is productive of Evil, by exciting De&s;ires to promote <HI>&s;ome</HI> by Means prejudicial to <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OUR</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;eems to give a Check to this irregular Fondne&s;s in Nature, and, at the &s;ame Time, a Pre&s;ident for us: <HI>Who is my Mother, and who are my Brethren?</HI> Thereby intimating, that the earthly Ties of Relation&s;hip, are, comparatively, incon&s;ide|rable to &s;uch who, thro' a &s;teady Cour&s;e of Obedience, have come to the happy Experience of the Spirit of God bearing witne&s;s with their Spirits that they are his Children:&mdash;<HI>And he &s;tretched forth his Hands towards his Di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, Behold my Mother and my Brethren: For who&s;oever &s;hall do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven</HI> (arrives at the more noble Part of true Relation&s;hip) <HI>the &s;ame is my Brother, and Si&s;ter, and Mother,</HI> Mat. <HI>xii. 48.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="007341_0004_102B5B9A673B22F8"><HI>THIS</HI> Doctrine agrees well with a State truly compleat, where <HI>Love</HI> nece&s;&s;arily operates according to the Agreeablene&s;s of Things on Principles unalterable and in them&s;elves perfect.</P>
<P><HI>IF</HI> endeavouring to have my Children emi|nent among&s;t Men after my Death, be that which no Rea&s;ons grounded on tho&s;e Principles can be brought to &s;upport; then to be tempe|rate in my Pur&s;uit after Gain, and to keep al|ways within the Bounds of tho&s;e Principles, is an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty, and to depart from it, a dark unfruitful Toil.</P>
<P><HI>IN</HI> our pre&s;ent Condition, to <HI>love</HI> our Chil|dren is needful; but except this <HI>Love</HI> pro|ceeds from the true heavenly Principle which &s;ees beyond earthly Trea&s;ures, it will rather be injurious than of any real Advantage to them: Where the Fountain is corrupt, the Streams mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be impure.</P>
<P><HI>THAT</HI> important Injunction of our Saviour, <HI>Mat. vi. 33.</HI> with the Promi&s;e annexed, contains a &s;hort but comprehen&s;ive View of our Duty and Happine&s;s:&mdash;If then the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mankind in this Life, is, to fir&s;t &s;eek an|other; if this cannot be done, but by attend|ing to the Means; if a Summary of the Means is, <HI>Not to do that to another
<PB REF="007341_0005_102B5B9BEB49BDC8">
which, in like Circum&s;tances, we would not have done unto us,</HI> then the&s;e are Points of Moment, and worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>WHAT</HI> I write on this Subject is with Re|luctance, and the Hints given are in as gene|ral Terms as my Concern would allow: I knew it is a Point about which in all its Branches Men that appear to aim well are not generally agreed, and for that Rea&s;on I cho&s;e to avoid being very particular:&mdash;If I may happily have let drop any Thing that may excite &s;uch as are concerned in the Practice to a close Thinking on the Subject treated of, the Cand<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="2 letters"> among&s;t them may ea&s;ily do the Subject &s;uch further ju&s;tice, as, on an impartial Enquiry it may appear to de&s;erve; and &s;uch an En|quiry I would earne&s;tly recommend.</P>

<HEAD>SOME CONSIDERATIONS On the KEEPING of <HI>NEGROES.</HI></HEAD>

<Q><P>Fora&s;much as ye did it to the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye did it unto me,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS Many Times there are different Motives to the &s;ame Actions; and one does that from a generous Heart, which another does for &s;elfi&s;h Ends:&mdash;The like may be &s;aid in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are various Circum&s;tances a|mong&s;t them that keep <HI>Negroes,</HI> and dif|ferent
<PB N="2" REF="007341_0007_102B5BA12C8BB790">
Ways by which they fall under their Care; and, I doubt not, there are many well di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons among&s;t them who de&s;ire rather to manage wi&s;e|ly and ju&s;tly in this difficult Matter, than to make Gain of it.</P>
<P>BUT the general Di&s;advantage which the&s;e poor <HI>Africans</HI> lie under in an en|light'ned Chri&s;tian Country, having of|ten fill'd me with real Sadne&s;s, and been like undige&s;ted Matter on my Mind, I now think it my Duty, through Divine Aid, to offer &s;ome Thoughts thereon to the Con&s;ideration of others.</P>
<P>WHEN we remember that all Nations are of one Blood, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 20. that in this World we are but Sojourners, that we are &s;ubject to the like Afflictions and Infirmities of Body, the like Di&s;orders and Frailties in Mind, the like Tempta|tions, the &s;ame Death, and the &s;ame Judgment, and, that the Alwi&s;e Being is Judge and Lord over us all, it &s;eems to rai&s;e an Idea of a general Brother+hood, and a Di&s;po&s;ition ea&s;y to be touch+ed with a Feeling of each others Afflicti+ons: But when we forget tho&s;e Thing and look chiefly at our outward Circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="3" REF="007341_0008_102B5BA34A8A9008">
in this and &s;ome Ages pa&s;t, con|&s;tantly retaining in our Minds the Di|&s;tinction betwixt us and them, with re|&s;pect to our Knowledge and Improve|ment in Things divine, natural and art|ificial, our Brea&s;ts being apt to be filled with fond Notions of Superiority; there is Danger of erring in our Conduct to|ward them.</P>
<P>WE allow them to be of the &s;ame Spe|cies with our&s;elves, the Odds is, we are in a higher Station, and enjoy greater Favours than they: And when it is thus, that our heavenly Father endoweth &s;ome of his Children with di&s;tingui&s;hed Gifts, they are intended for good Ends; but if tho&s;e thus gifted are thereby lifted up above their Brethren, not con&s;idering them&s;elves as Debtors to the Weak, nor behaving them&s;elves as faithful Stewards, none who judge impartially can &s;uppo&s;e them free from Ingratitude.</P>
<P>WHEN a People dwell under the libe|ral Di&s;tribution of Favours from Heaven, it behoves them carefully to in&s;pect their Ways, and con&s;ider the Purpo&s;es for which tho&s;e Favours were be&s;towed, le&s;t, through Forgetfulne&s;s of God, and
<PB N="4" REF="007341_0009_102B5BA5AF2949B8">
Mi&s;u&s;ing his Gifts, they incur his heavy Di&s;plea&s;ure, who&s;e Judgments are ju&s;t and equal, who exalteth and humbleth to the Du&s;t as he &s;eeth meet.</P>
<P>IT appears by Holy Record that Men under high Favours have been apt to err in their Opinions concerning others. Thus <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> according to De&s;cription of the Prophet, <HI>Isai.</HI> lxv. 5. when ex|ceedingly corrupted and degenerated, yet remembred they were the cho&s;en People of God, and could &s;ay, <HI>Stand by thy&s;elf, come not near me, for I am belier than thou.</HI> That this was no chance Language, but their common Opinion of other People, more fully appears by con|&s;idering the Circum&s;tances which attend|ed when God was beginning to fulfil his precious Promi&s;es concerning the Gather|ing of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>THE Mo&s;t High, in a Vi&s;ion, undecei|ved <HI>Peter,</HI> fir&s;t prepared his Heart to be|lieve; and, at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> &s;hewed him of a Certainty that God was no Re&s;pector of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE Effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t upon a People with whom they, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians, would not &s;o much as cat,
<PB N="5" REF="007341_0010_102B5BA8EEBB8810">
was &s;trange to them: All they of the Cirqumci&s;ion were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee it; and the Apo&s;tles and Brethren of <HI>Judea</HI> contended with <HI>Peter</HI> about it, till he, having rehear&s;ed the whole Matter, and fully &s;hewn that the Father's Love was unlimited, they are thereat &s;ttuck with Admiration, and cry out; <HI>Then hath God al&s;o to the</HI> Gentiles <HI>granted Repentance unto Life!</HI></P>
<P>THE Opinion of peculiar Favours be|ing confined to them, was deeply rooted, or el&s;e the above In&s;tance had been le&s;s &s;trange to them, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They were generally acquainted with the Writings of the Prophets, by whom this Time was repeatedly &s;poken of, and pointed at. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hortly before expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>I have other Sheep, not of this Fold, them al&s;o mu&s;t I bring,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> His Words to them after his Re&s;urrection, at the very Time of his A&s;cention, <HI>Ye &s;hall be Witne&s;&s;es, to me, not only in</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Judea, <HI>and</HI> Sa|maria, <HI>but to the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE concuring Circum&s;tances, one would think, might have rai&s;ed a &s;trong
<PB N="6" REF="007341_0011_102B5BAA713EEF00">
Expectation of &s;eeing &s;uch a Time; yet; when it came, it proved Matter of Of|fence and A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider Mankind otherwi&s;e than Brethren, to think Favours are peculiar to one Nation, and exclude others, plain|ly &s;uppo&s;es a Darkne&s;s in the Under|&s;tanding: For as God's Love is univer|&s;al, &s;o where the Mind is &s;ufficiently influenced by it, it begets a Likene&s;s of it&s;elf, and the Heart is enlarged towards all Men. Again, to conclude a People froward, perver&s;e, and wor&s;e by Nature than others (who ungratefully receive Fa|vours, and apply them to bad Ends) this will excite a Behaviour toward them unbecoming the Excellence of true Religion.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;uch Error, let us calmly con&s;ider their Circum&s;tance; and, the better to do it, make their Ca&s;e ours. Suppo&s;e, then, that our Ance&s;tors and we had been expo&s;ed to con&s;tant Ser|vitude in the more &s;ervile and inferior Employments of Life; that we had been de&s;titute of the Help of Reading and good Company; that among&s;t our&s;elves we had had few wi&s;e and pious In&s;truc|tors; that the Religious among&s;t our
<PB N="7" REF="007341_0012_102B5BAE1F3BD1B0">
Superiors &s;eldom took Notice of us, that while others, in Ea&s;e, have plen|tifully heap'd up the Fruit of our La|bour, we had receiv'd barely enough to relieve Nature, and being wholly at the Command of others, had generally been treated as a contemptible, ignorant Part of Mankind: Should we, in that Ca&s;e, be le&s;s abject than they now are? Again, If Oppre&s;&s;ion be &s;o hard to bear, that a wi&s;e Man is made mad by it, <HI>Eccl.</HI> vii. 7. then a Series of tho&s;e Things alter|ing the Behaviour and Manners of a People, is what may rea&s;onably be ex|pected.</P>
<P>WHEN our Property is taken contrary to our Mind, by Means appearing to us unju&s;t, it is only through divine Influ|ence, and the Enlargement of Heart from thence proceeding, that we can love our reputed Oppre&s;&s;ors: If the <HI>Negroes</HI> fall &s;hort in this, an unea&s;y, if not a di&s;con&s;o|late Di&s;po&s;ition, will be awak'ned, and remain like Seeds in their Minds, pro|ducing Sloth and many other Habits ap|pearing odious to us, with which being free Men, they, perhaps, had not been chargeable. The&s;e, and other Circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="8" REF="007341_0013_102B5BAFA3ACDBB8">
rightly con&s;idered, will le&s;&s;en that too great Di&s;parity, which &s;ome make between us and them.</P>
<P>INTEGRITY of Heart hath appeared in &s;ome of them; &s;o that if we continue in the Word of Chri&s;t (previous to Di&s;|ciple&s;hip, <HI>John</HI> viii. 31.) and our Con|duct towards them be &s;ea&s;oned with his Love, we may hope to &s;ee the good Effect of it: The which, in a good De|gree, is the Ca&s;e with &s;ome into who&s;e Hands they have fallen: But that too many treat them otherwi&s;e, not &s;eeming concious of any Neglect, is, alas! too evident.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Self-love</HI> pre&s;ides in our Minds, our Opinions are bias'd in our own Fa|vour; in this Condition, being concerned with a People &s;o &s;ituated, that they have no Voice to plead their own Cau&s;e, there's Danger of u&s;ing our&s;elves to an undi&s;turbed Partiality, till, by long Cu&s;|tom, the Mind becomes reconciled with it, and the Judgment it&s;elf infected.</P>
<P>To humbly apply to God for Wi&s;dom, that we may thereby be enabled to &s;ee Things as they are, and ought to be, is very needful; hereby the hidden
<PB N="9" REF="007341_0014_102B5BB1D9BB2880">
Things of Darkne&s;s may be brought to light, and the Judgment made clear: We &s;hall then con&s;ider Mankind as Brethren: Though different Degrees and a Variety of Qualifications and Abilities, one dependant on another, be admitted, yet high Thoughts will be laid a&s;ide, and all Men treated as becometh the Sons of one Father, agreeable to the Doctrine of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P><Q>HE hath laid down the be&s;t Crite|rion, by which Mankind ought to judge of their own Conduct, and o|thers judge for them of theirs, one towards another, <HI>viz. What&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI> I take it, that all Men by Nature, are equally entituled to the Equity of this Rule, and under the indi&s;pen&s;able Obligations of it. One Man ought not to look upon an|other Man, or Society of Men, as &s;o far beneath him, but that he &s;hould put him&s;elf in their Place, in all his Actions towards them, and bring all to this Te&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> How &s;hould I ap|prove of this Conduct, were I in their Circum&s;tance and they in mine?</Q> <HI>A.

Ar&s;ect's</HI> Con&s;iderations, Part III. Fol 107.</P>
<P>THIS Doctrine being of a moral un|changeable Nature, hath been likewi&s;e inculcated in the former Di&s;pen&s;ation; If <HI>a Stranger &s;ojourn with thee in your Land ye &s;hall not vex him; but the Stranger that dwelleth with you, &s;hall be as One born a+mong&s;t you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf Lev.</HI> xix. 33, 34. Had the&s;e People come voluntarily and dwelt among&s;t us, to have called them Strangers would be proper and their being brought by Force, with Regret, and a langui&s;hing Mind, may well rai&s;e Compa&s;&s;ion in a Heart rightly di&s;po&s;ed: But there is Nothing in &s;uch Treatment, which upon a wi&s;e and judi|cious Con&s;ideration, will any Ways le&s;&s;er their Right of being treated as Strangers. If the Treatment which many of them meet with, be rightly examined and com|pared with tho&s;e Precepts, <HI>Thou &s;halt not vex him nor oppre&s;s him; he &s;hall be as one born among&s;t you, and thou &s;halt love him as thy&s;elf,</HI> Lev. xix. 33. Deut xxvii. 19. there will appear an im|portant Difference betwixt them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007341_0016_102B5BB6C733B448">IT may be objected there is Co&s;t of Purcha&s;e, and Ri&s;que of their Lives to them who po&s;&s;e&s;s 'em, and therefore needful that they make the be&s;t U&s;e of their Time: In a Practice ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable, &s;uch Objections may have Weight; but if the Work be wrong from the Beginning, there's little or no Force in them. If I purcha&s;e a Man who hath never forfeited his Liberty, the natural Right of Freedom is in him; and &s;hall I keep him and his Po&s;|terity in Servitude and Ignorance? <Q>How &s;hould I approve of this Con|duct, were I in his Circum&s;tances, and he in mine?</Q> It may be thought, that to treat them as we would willingly be treated, our Gain by them would be in|con&s;iderable: And it were, in divers Re|&s;pects, better that there were none in our Country.</P>
<P>WE may further con&s;ider, that they are now among&s;t us, and tho&s;e of our Nation the Cau&s;e of their being here; that what&s;oever Difficulty accrues there|on, we are ju&s;tly chargeable with, and to bear all Inconveniencies attending it, with a &s;erious and weighty Concern of

<P>HOW deeply &s;oever Men are involved in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Difficulties, Since|rity of Heart, and upright Walking be|fore God, freely &s;ubmitting to his Pro|vidence, is the mo&s;t &s;ure Remedy: He only is able to relieve, not only Per&s;ons, but Nations, in their greate&s;t Calamities.</P>
<P>DAVID, in a great Strait, when the Sen&s;e of his pa&s;t Error, and the full Ex|pectation of an impending Calamity, as the Reward of it, were united to the agravating his Di&s;tre&s;s, after &s;ome Deli|beration, &s;aith, <HI>Let me fall now into the Hands of the Lord, for very great are his Mercies; let me not fall into the Hand of Man,</HI> 1 Chron. xxi. 13.</P>
<P>TO act continually with Integrity of Heart, above all narrow or &s;elfi&s;h Mo|tives, is a &s;ure Token of our being Par|takers of that Salvation which <HI>God hath appointed for Walls and Bulwarks,</HI> I&s;a. v. 26. Rom. xv. 8. and is, beyond all

<P>A SUPPLY to Nature's lawful Wants, joined with a peaceful, humble Mind, is the true&s;t Happine&s;s in this Life; and if here we arrive to this, and remain to walk in the Path of the Ju&s;t, our Ca&s;e will be truly happy: And though herein we may part with, or mi&s;s of &s;ome glaring Shews of Riches, and leave our Chil|dren little el&s;e but wi&s;e In&s;tructions, a good Example, and the Knowledge of &s;ome hone&s;t Employment, the&s;e, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, are &s;ufficient for their Happine&s;s, and are more likely to prove &s;o, than laying up Trea&s;ures for them, which are often rather a Snare, than any real Benefit; e&s;pecially to them, who, in&s;tead of being exampled to Tem|perance, are in all Things taught to prefer the getting of Riches, and to eye the temporal Di&s;tinctions they give, as the principal Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Life. The&s;e readily overlook the true Happine&s;s of Man, as it re&s;ults from the Enjoyment of all Things in the Fear of

<P>IT is the Conclu&s;ion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and his Apo&s;tles, as appears by their Lives and Doctrines, that the highe&s;t Delights of Sen&s;e, or mo&s;t plea|&s;ing Objects vi&s;ible, ought ever to be ac|counted infinitely inferior to that real intellectual Happine&s;s &s;uited to Man in his primitive Innocence, and now to be found in true Renovation of Mind; and that the Comforts of our pre&s;ent Life, the Things mo&s;t grateful to us, ought always to be receiv'd with Temperance, and never made the chief Objects of our De&s;ire, Hope, or Love: But that our whole Heart and Affections be princi|pally looking to that <HI>City, which hath Foundations, who&s;e Maker and Builder is God.</HI> Did we &s;o improve the Gifts be|&s;towed on us, that our Children might have an Education &s;uited to the&s;e Doc|trines, and our Example to confirm it, we might rejoice in Hopes of their being Heirs of an Inheritance incorruptible.</P>

<P>ABRAHAM was called of God to leave his Country and Kindred, to &s;ojourn a|mon&s;t Strangers: Through Famine, and Danger of Death, he was forced to flee from one Kingdom to another: He, at length, not only had A&s;&s;urance of being the Father of many Nations, but became a mighty Prince, <HI>Gen.</HI> xxiii. 6.</P>

<P>THE numerous Afflictions of <HI>Joseph,</HI> are very &s;ingular; the particular Provi|dence of God therein, no le&s;s manife&s;t: He, at length, became Governor of <HI>E|gypt,</HI> and famous for Wi&s;dom and Virtue.</P>
<P>THE Series of Troubles <HI>David</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through, few among&s;t us are ignorant of; and yet he afterwards became as one of the great Men of the Earth.</P>
<P>SOME Evidences of the Divine Wi&s;|dom appears in tho&s;e Things, in that &s;uch who are intended for high Stations, have fir&s;t been very low and dejected, that Truth might be &s;ealed on their Hearts, and that the Characters there imprinted by Bitterne&s;s and Adver&s;ity, might in after Years remain, &s;ugge&s;ting compa&s;&s;ionate Ideas, and, in their Pro&s;|perity, quicken their Regard to tho&s;e in the like Condition: Which yet further appears in the Ca&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> They were well acquainted with grievous Suffer|ings, a long and rigorous Servitude, then, through many notable Events, were

<P>IF we call to Mind our Beginning, &s;ome of us may find a Time, wherein our Fathers were under Afflictions, Re|proaches, and manifold Sufferings.</P>
<P>RESPECTING our Progre&s;s in this Land, the Time is &s;hort &s;ince our Begin|ning was &s;mall and Number few, com|pared with the native Inhabitants.

<P>WHEN we trace back the Steps we have trodden, and &s;ee how the Lord hath opened a Way in the Wilderne&s;s for us, to the Wi&s;e it will ea&s;ily ap|pear, that all this was not done to be buried in Oblivion; but to prepare a People for more fruitful Returns, and the Remembrance thereof, ought to humble us in Pro&s;perity, and excite in us a Chri|&s;tian Benevolence towards our Inferiors.</P>

<P>IF the Chri&s;tian Religion be con&s;ider|ed, both re&s;pecting its Doctrines, and the happy Influence which it hath on the Minds and Manners of all real Chri&s;ti|ans, it looks rea&s;onable to think, that the miraculous Manife&s;tation thereof to the World, is a Kindne&s;s beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ARE we the People thus favoured Are we they who&s;e Minds are opened influenced, and govern'd by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, and thereby made Sons of God?

<P>IF we, by the Operation of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, become Heirs with him in the Kingdom of his Father, and are re|deemed from the alluring counterfeit Joys of this World, and the Joy of Chri&s;t re|main in us, to &s;uppo&s;e that One remaining in this happy Condition, can for the Sake of earthly Riches, not only deprive his Fellow Creatures of the Sweetne&s;s of Freedom (which, rightly u&s;ed, is one of the greate&s;t temporal Ble&s;&s;ings) but therewith neglect u&s;ing proper Means, for their Acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, and the Advantage of true Religion, &s;eems, at lea&s;t, a Contradic|tion to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>WHOEVER rightly advocates the Cau&s;e of &s;ome, thereby promotes the Good of all. The State of Mankind was harmo|nious in the Beginning, and tho' Sin hath introduced Di&s;cord, yet, through the wonderful Love of God, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, the Way is open for our Redemption, and Means appointed to re&s;tore us to primitive Harmony.

<P>OUR Duty and Intere&s;t is in&s;epara|bly united, and when we neglect or mi&s;u&s;e our Talents, we nece&s;&s;arily de|part from the heavenly Fellow&s;hip, and are in the Way to the greate&s;t of Evils.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, to examine and prove our&s;elves, to find what Harmony the Power pre&s;iding in us bears with the Divine Nature, is a Duty not more in|cumbent and nece&s;&s;ary, than it would be beneficial.</P>

<P>IF we ob&s;erve Men, both Apo&s;tles and others, in many different Ages, who have really come to the Unity of the Spirit, and the Fellow&s;hip of the Saints, there &s;till appears the like Di&s;po&s;ition, and in them the De&s;ire of the real Hap|pine&s;s of Mankind, has out-ballanced the De&s;ire of Ea&s;e, Liberty, and, many Times, Life it&s;elf.</P>
