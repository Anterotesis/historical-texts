<OPENER><SALUTE>My Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD, perhaps, have had rather le&s;s need than I have at pre&s;ent, to apologize for the inaccuracy of the fol|lowing Di&s;cour&s;es, had they been compo&s;ed with any de&s;ign to make them more public than by preaching them. However, it is, even now, almo&s;t needle&s;s to a&s;k Your candor towards One, who has &s;o long expe|rienced it; and to a&s;k candor of &s;ome Others, would, I know, be in vain. The&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;uch as they are, were written and preached, with a &s;in|cere de&s;ire to &s;erve You in Your mo&s;t im|portant intere&s;t: I mean, to a&s;&s;i&s;t You in under&s;tanding &s;ome of the doctrines, and to excite You to practice all the duties, of the Go&s;pel. With the &s;ame view it is, that they are now publi&s;hed. I hope they will not be quite u&s;ele&s;s to You;

or, indeed, to any who &s;hall read them with a chri&s;tian &s;pirit, in&s;tead of doing it in the antichri&s;tian, illiberal &s;pirit, of cap|tiou&s;ne&s;s and party.</P>
<P>THE doctrinal &s;entiments running thro' them, are &s;uch as I have been led into, and confirmed in, by a careful inquiry af|ter truth, e&s;pecially in the HOLY SCRIP|TURES, without a zealous attachment to, or prejudice again&s;t, the opinions of Others. However, I pretend not to be exempted from mi&s;takes. There may po&s;&s;ibly be errors in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es: If there are, I am very &s;orry; and as heartily de&s;irous that tho&s;e who read, may di&s;cover and avoid, them. And if &s;ome per&s;on that is wi&s;er than my&s;elf, would point them out to Me, he would make me his debtor; e&s;pecially if he &s;hould do it in the &s;pirit of charity and meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF there are any con&s;iderable, or dan|gerous errors in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I may venture to &s;ay, they are not di&s;gui&s;ed by any kind of artifice: They do not ju&s;t peep thro' the ma&s;k of &s;tudied, equivocal, and ambiguous phra&s;es; nor &s;kulk in the dark, as it were from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what they are, and a fear of being detec|ted: They appear in open day-light, with all the naked boldne&s;s of truth and innocence. For I have conceived,
<PB N="iii" REF="007488_0004_102B8F7FEFBFEC38">
That the the end of &s;peaking, e&s;pecially of preaching, was to expre&s;s, not to di&s;|gui&s;e, a man's real &s;entiments: Tho' I know that I, herein, differ from many of my own Order! This will be a great ea&s;e and advantage to any Per&s;on, who &s;hall bring a charge of <HI>here&s;y</HI> again&s;t me; and undertake to convict me of it, whether privately or publickly. But You are &s;en&s;ible, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> that there is &s;ome difference betwixt railing and rea|&s;oning; and, con&s;equently, betwixt a man's being &s;colded at, and refuted. I wi&s;h &s;ome other people knew this al&s;o! But I mu&s;t now declare, once for all, That I will not be, even <HI>religiou&s;ly</HI> &s;colded, nor pitied, nor wept and lamented, out of any principles which I believe upon the authority of Scripture, in the exerci&s;e of that &s;mall &s;hare of rea&s;on which God has given me: Nor will I po&s;tpone this authority, to that of all the good <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Church, even with that of the good <HI>Mothers</HI> added to it!</P>
<P>THE only favour which I have, now, to a&s;k of You, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> and of O|thers who may happen to read the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, is, That you would do it with an open, unprejudiced mind; and then either reject, or believe and practice, ac|cording to the light and conviction of
<PB N="iv" REF="007488_0005_102B8F817687EE30">
your own con&s;ciences. Religion is a matter of too great importance to be only &s;lightly thought of: It demands Your fir&s;t and la&s;t attention. And as I hope You are all too &s;en&s;ible of common human frailty, to be uncharitable bigots and party-men in religion; &s;o I hope You are, on the other hand, too wi&s;e to be &s;ceptics: The two extreams, into which men of weak and wicked minds often run; &s;ometimes, indeed, out of the one, directly into the other, without &s;topping a moment at the golden medium.</P>
<P>YOU have a ju&s;t title, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> to my warme&s;t good wi&s;hes, and to my prayers, by virtue of the relation in which I &s;tand towards You: The&s;e wi&s;hes and prayers are, That You may all <Q>know the truth as it is in JESUS;</Q> and final|ly partake of that ble&s;&s;ed life, and glorious immortality, brought to light by HIM, thro' the Go&s;pel. But, in the mean time, I will not forget to wi&s;h You all temporal and worldly pro&s;perity; being, in all re&s;pects,</P>

<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> I am to repre&s;ent the obligation lying upon all Chri&s;tians in general to be <HI>Hearers</HI> of the Word and Go&s;pel of the Kingdom. I &s;ay, lying upon <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> becau&s;e it is to &s;uch, that the apo&s;tle is here &s;peaking; not to uncon|verted <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but to tho&s;e of the <HI>twelve Tribes &s;cattered abroad,</HI> who were already pro&s;elyted to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith;</HI> as appears from the Epi&s;tle it&s;elf. However it is not meant, that this is the duty of Chri&s;tians, exclu&s;ively of others. Our Saviour having commanded, that the go&s;pel &s;hould be preached <HI>for a witne&s;s</HI> to all People; all are accordingly required to hearken to it; and tho&s;e who refu&s;e to do this, are, in the language of &s;cripture, &s;aid to <HI>judge them&s;elves</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="007488_0011_102B8F8CE78399C0">
<HI>unworthy of eternal life.</HI> But &s;eeing the apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> here directs his Di&s;cour&s;e to profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch.</P>
<P>IT is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when Per&s;ons are once become Believers of the Go&s;pel, they need have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> farther concern to hear, and to attend to it, from time to time; as tho' this <HI>wi&s;dom of God in a my&s;tery,</HI> were to be learned all at once, and di&s;regarded afterwards. The apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in a manner that pre&s;uppo&s;es it to be the known, acknowledged duty of Chri&s;|tians in common, to give con&s;tant and diligent Heed to <HI>the word which began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed by them that heard him:</HI> For his Exhortation chiefly re&s;pects the <HI>manner</HI> in which this word of Truth ought to be received; the duty of Hearing it <HI>in general,</HI> be|ing rather taken for granted, than directly a&s;&s;erted. And by his u&s;ing the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>hearing the word,</HI> repeatedly, as he does in the Context, it is at lea&s;t probable, that he had a &s;pecial reference to hearing it preached <HI>in Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> at <HI>&s;tated Times,</HI> by tho&s;e who&s;e &s;pecial <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> it was to <HI>teach,</HI> to <HI>reprove,</HI> to <HI>rebuke,</HI> and <HI>exhort, with all long &s;uffering and doctrine.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> did not de&s;ign to preclude, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and private, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> places, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> them. But
<PB N="5" REF="007488_0012_102B8F8F8128E000">
whoever will be at the pains to look into the Chapter, will, if I mi&s;take not, find that St. <HI>James</HI> had a particular reference to the &s;tated, and divinely in&s;tituted method of Chri&s;tian edifi|cation in the A&s;&s;emblies and Churches of the Saints; wherein one Per&s;on, at lea&s;t, exerci&s;ed the office of a Teacher; in&s;tructing the young and ignorant, &s;tirring up the minds of the more knowing, and inculcating upon all, the practice of Chri&s;tian piety and virtue.</P>
<P>THIS was one very con&s;iderable end, tho' not the only one, propo&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;titution of Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies. And it is, in a great mea&s;ure, by this means that Chri&s;tianity has been handed down from age to age, from generation to generation; tho' not with equal purity and advantage in all times and places. And one may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, upon the whole, great good has re&s;ulted to the world from this practice; and that Chri&s;tians cannot, under any pretence whatever, <HI>for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves to|gether,</HI> for the mentioned purpo&s;e, without be|ing highly culpable. This is a Method of in|&s;truction and edification, that is plainly of divine in&s;titution, and therefore demands the regard and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all Chri&s;tians, at all times, and in all places, wherein it is practicable. Nor can con|forming to this in&s;titution, be u&s;ele&s;s and unpro|fitable to any, who a&s;&s;emble to hear the word with that <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> which the Apo&s;tle injoins: I
<PB N="6" REF="007488_0013_102B8F910904F1D8">
mean, provided the Go&s;pel is preached to them in any tolerable degree of purity and integrity. To be &s;ure the upholding of the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t be very advantageous to all that frequent them, if the holy Scriptures are read therein from time to time, in a language that is under&s;tood by all. Which, by the way, ought, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be one &s;tated and con&s;tant part of the religious exerci&s;e in the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies: Nor is the Omi&s;&s;ion hereof very con&s;i&s;tent with that regard Chri&s;tians in general profe&s;s, for the&s;e &s;acred writings; and which they evidently claim, as being <HI>given by in|&s;piration of God;</HI> and the great rule of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> The&s;e Scriptures at lea&s;t, are "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that every man and child of God may be perfect, and throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works." To them we ought &s;urely to give "diligent heed, as unto a light &s;hining in a dark place; they be|ing a &s;ure word of prophecy;" and graciou&s;ly given us of God, to guide our feet into the paths of truth and peace, until the dawn of a more perfect day, "and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in our Hearts."</P>
<P>NOR can it be rea&s;onably tho't, that the word preached even by fallible men, is altogether u&s;e|le&s;s and unprofitable to them that duly attend upon it. On the contrary, this is very condu|cive to the good end mentioned; and, as was
<PB N="7" REF="007488_0014_102B8F933A751A68">
intimated before, claims our regard, as an in&s;ti|tution of our Saviour, the Head of the Church; Who when he a&s;cended up on high, gave not only Apo&s;tles, Prophets and Evangeli&s;ts; but al&s;o "<HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying of His body, 'till we all come in the uni|ty of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea|&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t; that we be no more children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine."</P>
<P>HOWEVER imperfectly this bu&s;ine&s;s of public teaching and exhorting; of expounding the holy Scriptures, and urging the motives to evangelical obedience, may often be performed; yet it is un|que&s;tionably &s;ub&s;ervient to very good ends; and &s;hould not be contemned and di&s;regarded by any that call them&s;elves Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples. It will be no great compliment upon the <HI>Clergy</HI> (an order of men which I am not much di&s;po&s;ed to flatter) to &s;ay, that there are many per&s;ons in all coun|tries, who are not &s;uch proficients in Chri&s;tian knowledge, as to be quite pa&s;t receiving any in|&s;truction from them; e&s;pecially from &s;uch of them as "rightly divide the Word of truth." And &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who pre&s;ume this to be their own ca&s;e, may after all be a little mi&s;ta|ken in them&s;elves; and think as much too highly of their own abilities, as they do too lowly of
<PB N="8" REF="007488_0015_102B8F951EB7E058">
tho&s;e of others. To be &s;ure, one &s;hall hardly meet with more vain, &s;uperficial, empty Creatures, than among&s;t tho&s;e who take it upon them to run down that order of men; and to &s;et them at naught, as tho' all their in&s;tructions were u&s;ele&s;s to the world, at be&s;t. And the Clergy mu&s;t be very ignorant indeed, ignorant of the rudiments and fir&s;t principles of Chri&s;tianity, were they not able to in&s;truct a multitude of the&s;e blu&s;tering <HI>Sparks,</HI> and fooli&s;h, conceited <HI>Scoffers,</HI> who take it upon them&s;elves to run them down.

<P>IT is not to be doubted, indeed, but that, a|mong&s;t the <HI>Laiety,</HI> (I u&s;e this <HI>term</HI> merely for di&s;tinction &s;ake; not by way of reproach and contempt, as it has too often been u&s;ed by &s;ome arrogant <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks.</HI>) It is not to be doubted, I &s;ay, but that among&s;t the Laiety there are ma|ny per&s;ons, from whom a great part of the Cler|gy might be glad to be in&s;tructed, even in mat|ters that are more peculiarly their own province. But on the other hand, it is to be remembred, that there are great numbers of children and youth; and many per&s;ons of adult age, that are either of mean education, or none at all; many poor, labouring people, who have no time for reading and contemplation; and many others &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed with a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and

<P>MEN that are truly wi&s;e, are &s;en&s;ible that they need &s;omething be&s;ides &s;peculative knowledge, &s;omething be&s;ides the &s;cience of religion, con&s;i|dered as the furniture of the head.

They are aware how apt good impre&s;&s;ions on the heart, are to wear out, or at lea&s;t to grow faint and dim, if not frequently renewed. They know that the &s;pirit of devotion, and the religion of the heart, is a fire which will in&s;en&s;ibly langui&s;h and go to decay, in the damps and mi&s;ts and impure vapors of this world, if it be not often &s;upplied with new fewel from heaven, and from that word of God which is &s;ometimes like a fire, to melt and inflame the heart, as well as, at others, like a &s;word to pierce, or a hammer to break it in pieces. They are &s;en&s;ible how expedient and profitable it is, to have the great proofs of Chri&s;|tianity &s;et before them from time to time; to|gether with the great motives to holine&s;s of life; the maje&s;ty and perfections of God; the love and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the vanity of this world; the excellency and happine&s;s of reli|gion; the glories and terrors of the la&s;t day; the joys of the righteous, and the de&s;truction and mi&s;ery of the wicked.

<P>WERE it only for example-&s;ake, the more knowing part of Chri&s;tians ought certainly to countenance and encourage the publick religious exerci&s;es of the Lord's Day, by attending upon them.

<HI>may peri&s;h, for whom Christ died.</HI> When|ever it &s;hall come to be generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the religious exerci&s;es here intended, are de&s;igned only for the benefit of the vulgar and illiterate; and when they &s;hall accordingly be neglected by per&s;ons of knowledge and capacity, it will &s;oon be looked upon as di&s;reputable for <HI>any</HI> to attend upon them, as being a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of their ignorance. And &s;o every one, will think him|&s;elf under a &s;ort of obligation to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the publick wor&s;hip of his Maker, and from the place where his word is read and preached; in order to prove to the world that he is a man of <HI>wi&s;dom.</HI> And indeed there are many among&s;t us who give no other evidence be&s;ides this, of their &s;uperiority to the bulk of mankind; tho' I cannot at pre&s;ent think it a conclu&s;ive argument.</P>
<P>BUT to draw towards a conclu&s;ion of this di&s;|cour&s;e: It is manife&s;tly the duty of all Chri&s;tians in common to hear the word; particularly, to hear it in the public <HI>a&s;&s;embly of the Saints,</HI> upon the &s;tated times for &s;uch religious exerci&s;es. It is the duty of the young and old, wi&s;e and &s;imple, male and female, bond and free, to come and <HI>&s;it before God as his People &s;itteth,</HI> (to u&s;e the language of Scripture); and con&s;tantly to at|tend upon the appointed means of in&s;truction and edification. The go&s;pel injoins this upon all, without making any exception. The far greater part of Chri&s;tians are not pa&s;t being taught and
<PB N="15" REF="007488_0022_102B8FA762BF5ED8">
in&s;tructed in this way: Some may have their pure, and others, their impure minds, &s;tirred up: Some may be inlightned in their duty: Others may have known duties inculcated upon them to advan|tage; and ALL may be furthered in the way that leads to eternal life, provided they hear the word with a &s;uitable temper of mind. It is no &s;ufficient excu&s;e for neglecting the publick wor&s;hip, that the Per&s;on who <HI>officiates,</HI> is not one of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed capacity and great learning; or that he is not even <HI>as one that has a plea&s;ant voice, and can play well upon an in&s;trument.</HI> It is better to hear the great doctrines, duties and promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, from the mouth of a plain, illiterate man, than not to hear them at all: And the &s;oul may be caught up to Heaven, altho' not wafted thither by mu&s;ic and harmonious founds.</P>
<P>To conclude, therefore, let me be&s;eech all tho&s;e who claim the worthy and &s;acred name of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> (for with others I am not now con|cerned) to be <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> hearers of the word. There are no excu&s;es for neglecting this, ca&s;es of <HI>nece&s;|&s;ity</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> being excepted, which will not &s;how either the ignorance, or the pride and va|nity, of tho&s;e who make them. And it a man is not &s;o much as a <HI>hearer,</HI> we have &s;urely no rea&s;on to think that he is a <HI>doer</HI> of the word, or will be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed. Chri&s;tians ought doubtle&s;s to be left at liberty where, and with whom they will a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e men|tioned:
<PB N="16" REF="007488_0023_102B8FA8ED0A2AA8">
And &s;hould exerci&s;e their rea&s;on, di&s;cre|tion and con&s;cience in making the choice. But they are ab&s;olutely inexcu&s;able if they do not at|tend the publick wor&s;hip &s;ome where or other; even tho' there may be no &s;ect, church or deno|mination of Chri&s;tians, with which they can in|tirely fall in. It is one of the chief honours of the pre&s;ent age, that the principles of religion, particularly of religious liberty, are better under|&s;tood, and more generally e&s;pou&s;ed, than they have, perhaps been, &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles. It were to be wi&s;hed, that practical Chri&s;tianity had made progre&s;s in the &s;ame proportion. But it cannot be denied, that many, together with &s;ome vulgar errors and &s;uper&s;titions, have in a manner thrown off even the <HI>form of godline&s;s;</HI> laying no &s;tre&s;s at all upon tho&s;e outward ordi|nances and in&s;titutions, upon which too great a &s;tre&s;s has doubtle&s;s been laid heretofore.

However, I &s;hall take the liberty to con&s;ider the words in a greater latitude, as de&s;igned to injoin upon us all that care and reverence, that candor and love of truth, that &s;implicity and docility of mind, which be|come &s;inful creatures, when the Go&s;pel is prea|ched to them; and which are &s;utable to the na|ture and de&s;ign of this di&s;pen&s;ation of the Grace of God to the World. And the admonition may accordingly compri&s;e in it the following par|ticulars:</P>
<P>THAT we hear the word with <HI>care</HI> and <HI>atten|tion,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to &s;loth, li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, and a lazy indifference:</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="007488_0027_102B8FB0336CD738">
WITH <HI>patience</HI> and <HI>affectionate regard</HI> to the truth, altho' nothing <HI>new</HI> &s;hould be &s;aid upon the &s;ubject treated, in oppo&s;ition to that vain curio&s;ity and love of novelty, which we &s;ee in tho&s;e that have <HI>itching Ears:</HI></P>
<P>WITH <HI>candour</HI> and <HI>impartiality,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to all per&s;onal prejudice, and to the &s;pirit of party:</P>

<P>AND la&s;tly, With a &s;ingle view, and an hearty de&s;ire, to receive chri&s;tian edification; and to obtain that which is the great end of the Go&s;pel-revelation, and of our Faith in it, <HI>even the Salva|tion of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>LET me inlarge a little upon the &s;everal par|ticulars hinted at above.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE &s;hould hear the word with <HI>care</HI> and <HI>attention,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to &s;loth, li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, and a lazy indifference. Chri&s;tians ought not, at any time, to be <HI>&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> but ever <HI>fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord.</HI> But there is a pecu|liar impropriety in withdrawing our attention, and indulging to &s;loth, when we are a&s;&s;embled to wor&s;hip God, and to hear his word. The
<PB N="22" REF="007488_0028_102B8FB1C08CF9D8">
coldne&s;s and carele&s;ne&s;s, with which many Chri|&s;tians &s;it under the di&s;pen&s;ation of this heavenly doctrine, is very &s;urpri&s;ing, and hardly to be ac|counted for. The Go&s;pel is not only the word of Him that &s;peaketh from heaven; but it is that wherein we are all particularly intere&s;ted, and far more &s;o than we are in any thing be&s;ides. This is that Go&s;pel which contains the overtures of peace and reconciliation, which God is making to his &s;inful Creatures; wherein "Life and im|mortality are brought to light"; which contains all the &s;olid grounds of our hope and expecta|tions of future bli&s;s; and which we ought in rea|&s;on to look upon as <HI>good news from a far coun|try;</HI> "a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all ac|ceptation". With what rai&s;ed attention? with what holy reverence? with what humble grati|tude, does it then become us to hear and receive this ingrafted word, which is able to &s;ave our &s;ouls; and which is &s;poken to us &s;olely for that end? But alas! were a trifling, unconcerning &s;tory told us, from a remote part of the world, by &s;ome romantic traveller, many per&s;ons would be at lea&s;t as attentive to it, and &s;ome much more &s;o, than they are in our religious a&s;&s;emblies, to tho&s;e glad tidings which Chri&s;t, the true and faithful witne&s;s, has brought from Heaven to Earth. Altho' God, who "at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, &s;pake to the fathers by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken to
<PB N="23" REF="007488_0029_102B8FB39A0E5960">
the world by his Son"; yet many to whom this go&s;pel of the Kingdom is preached, and who profe&s;s to believe it, pay far le&s;s regard to it, than they would to an account of the <HI>Mogul-Empire;</HI> of the wars of <HI>Kouli Kan;</HI> and of many other things, if po&s;&s;ible, both le&s;s intere&s;ting to them, and le&s;s con&s;iderable in their own nature. They could not doze and &s;lumber more, while the mo&s;t idle, the mo&s;t unintere&s;ting tales were tel|ling, than they do, when the Go&s;pel of their Salvation is read or preached to them. Good God! what impiety? what infatuation is this? Is this to pay a due regard to thy overtures of peace and happine&s;s to rebellious mortals! Is this to give proper heed to the Revelation which thou ha&s;t made of thy &s;elf by thy Son! Is this to hear, and to receive with meekne&s;s, the in|grafted word! Is it not rather to &s;top the ear again&s;t the voice of divine love and compa&s;&s;ion! Is it not rather to throw manife&s;t open contempt upon thy word, than to pay any honor to it!</P>
<P>SOME of tho&s;e per&s;ons whom I here intend, are &s;o far from hearing the word with a becom|ing attention, that they do not hear it all; but de&s;ignedly compo&s;e them&s;elves to re&s;t in the place of public wor&s;hip, as tho' they <HI>had not hou&s;es to &s;leep in;</HI> or rather, as tho' they were determined to &s;how how much they <HI>de&s;pi&s;e the Church of God,</HI> and at once to ca&s;t contempt both upon God and Man. For this is done by tho&s;e who
<PB N="24" REF="007488_0030_102B8FB5D98A1DD0">
&s;it in the &s;eat of the <HI>&s;leepers,</HI> as well as tho&s;e who &s;it in that of the <HI>&s;corners.</HI> And it is pro|bable that few would be thus pa&s;t <HI>hearing,</HI> were they not fir&s;t <HI>pa&s;t feeling, having their con&s;ciences &s;eared as with an hot iron.</HI> In &s;hort, the inde|cent cu&s;tom of which I am now &s;peaking, is e|qually an affront to God and man; an equal con|tradiction to all piety, and good manners: Nor will any allow them&s;elves in it, who have not both a <HI>&s;tony heart,</HI> and a <HI>brazen front.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. CHRISTIANS ought to hear the word with <HI>&s;obriety</HI> and <HI>due decorum,</HI> in oppo&s;ition not only to a dull indifference and o&s;citancy; but al&s;o in oppo&s;ition to that indecent levity and rudene&s;s, which we &s;ometimes &s;ee in our religious a&s;&s;em|blies. The tidings which the Go&s;pel brings are too intere&s;ting to be heard with coldne&s;s and care|le&s;ne&s;s; too &s;erious, &s;olemn and &s;acred, to be heard with unholy mirth, and wanton gaiety. The important nature and &s;ubject of this me&s;&s;age from God to man, evidently demand a devout and reverential, as well as a diligent and fixed attention in the hearer. However &s;ome &s;eem to indulge them&s;elves as much in un&s;ea&s;onable, un|&s;eemly levity of mind, as others do in an irreli|gious lumpi&s;hne&s;s, and a certain lifele&s;s, &s;piritle&s;s gravity. Nor is the former of the&s;e, any more than the latter, a &s;utable frame and temper with which to receive the ingrafted word. To hear it

<P>OUR Saviour's di&s;cour&s;es often bore a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear re&s;emblance one to the other. The Apo&s;tles did not always preach new doctrines; nor yet ex|pre&s;s the old in different language. Yea, they profe&s;&s;edly deliver the <HI>&s;ame things</HI> over again; altho' the per&s;ons to whom they wrote and prea|ched, <HI>already knew them, and were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e truths.</HI> And in fine, when our Lord was in&s;tructing his Apo&s;tles in their mini&s;terial office, he tells them, that <Q>every &s;cribe which is in&s;truc|ted unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man which is an hou&s;holder, which bringeth out of his trea&s;ure things <HI>new</HI> and <HI>old.</HI></Q></P>

<P>IF &s;o be then, we know the grace of God in truth; if we have ta&s;ted and &s;een that the Lord is gracious; if we truly hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; the&s;e old doctrines and command|ments, will be ever new and grateful to us.

<P>LASTLY; and to &s;um up all in one word: We &s;hould hear with a &s;ingle view to our being edified as Chri&s;tians; and that we may, at length receive that which is the great end of the go&s;pel, and of our faith in it, the Salvation of our Souls. Whenever we go to hear, we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly re|flect with our&s;elves what is the grand &s;cope and de&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity, that &s;o we may hear with a temper and di&s;po&s;ition corre&s;ponding thereto. This is the &s;um of all that has been &s;aid above up|on the &s;ubject; the re&s;ult and conclu&s;ion of this whole matter. Now we cannot but know, that this go&s;pel of the kingdom, which is, from time to time, preached to us, is a di&s;pen&s;ation of the grace of God to a guilty lo&s;t world; a revelation of his mercy to us by his Son, con&s;idered as &s;inful peri&s;hing creatures, ju&s;tly liable to wrath and de|&s;truction; a di&s;covery of God's kind intentions

towards us in general; and more particularly, of the method which his infinite wi&s;dom has pitched upon, and ordained, for our re&s;toration to his favour, to true wi&s;dom, holine&s;s and happine&s;s; the end of all being the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>THIS is the manife&s;t &s;cope and aim of the Chri&s;tian revelation: And while we keep this in view, we can hardly fail of perceiving how, and with what temper this divine me&s;&s;age ought to be received. The nature of the thing will &s;carce permit one that attends to it, to be at any lo&s;s in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.

candor, fairne&s;s and impartiality; with a de&s;ire to inform and better our minds; and, in fine, with an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that the end of it may be an&s;wered in the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. This is plainly the manner, this the way, this the temper and di&s;po&s;ition, with which we ought to hear and receive the ingrafted word.

If not, we &s;hall in the language of &s;cripture, "receive the grace of God in vain."</P>
<P>BUT there is &s;omething previou&s;ly requi&s;ite in order to our receiving the word in the manner de&s;cribed, which is, that we renounce all our gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts; tho&s;e vicious habits which the light of nature condemns; which darken and pervert our under&s;tanding; and make us di&s;reli&s;h the pure truths and doctrines, as well as the du|ties of the go&s;pel.

<P>I ANSWER, That the Apo&s;tle, by <HI>laying apart all filthine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. cannot be here &s;uppo&s;ed to mean any thing more than a <HI>partial</HI> reformation of mind and manners; &s;uch a one as does not come up to our idea of evangelical holine&s;s; but which is, at the &s;ame time, a &s;tep towards it; as it prepares and qualifies a per&s;on for receiving the word as he ought to do; as it renders him a proper &s;ubject for the go&s;pel to work upon. And if we under&s;tand him thus, it will wholly remove all appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency. For cer|tainly we may &s;uppo&s;e a vicious man reformed in &s;ome con&s;iderable mea&s;ure: and yet de&s;titute of that true principle of piety and holine&s;s, which it is the de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel to beget in us. But in order to &s;et this matter in as clear a light
<PB N="53" REF="007488_0059_102B8FF3A59DDE18">
as I can, I would premi&s;e two or three things more particularly, as follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is a real and manife&s;t difference be|twixt a per&s;on, who is only free from tho&s;e gro&s;s pollutions of the world; from that great depra|vity of mind and manners, intended by a <HI>&s;uper|fluity of naughtine&s;s,</HI> and a thorough Chri&s;tian; one who is already made meet for, and entitled to eternal life. If it may be &s;aid of the former, that he is "not far from the kingdom of God;" the latter is actually in it, and a loyal &s;ubject of it. If one of them is not intirely under the do|minion of &s;in; the other is a <HI>&s;ervant of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> If one is in &s;ome mea&s;ure delivered from the habits and practice of vice; the other has the po&s;itive principles and habits of virtue. If one has in part, "put off the old man with his deeds, which is corrupt according to deceitful lu&s;ts"; the other has "put on the new man, which after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. If one is not wholly &s;ubjected to the devil, "the &s;pirit that worketh in the chil|dren of di&s;obedience"; the other has a divine nature implanted in him, being "renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind". In fine, there is plainly a di&s;tinction to be made, betwixt one who has only &s;o much &s;en&s;e of religion and virtue, as to make him ab&s;tain from tho&s;e heinous immoralities which the light of nature condemns; and one who is,
<PB N="54" REF="007488_0060_102B8FF52E17A308">
in the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, a righteous good man, "bringing forth good things out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart."</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Go&s;pel is the great means which God has appointed for the rai&s;ing of men to that new, &s;piritual and divine life, which con&s;titutes the <HI>Chri&s;tian character.</HI> It is e&s;pecially in this di&s;|pen&s;ation of grace, that we have the things that "pertain to godline&s;s". Hereby, and herein, are given to us "great and precious promi&s;es, that by them we may be made partakers of a di|vine nature, having [before] e&s;caped the corrup|tions that are in the world thro' lu&s;t."</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the Go&s;pel may have this happy effect upon us, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be heartily embraced; that it &s;hould be <HI>received in meekne&s;s.</HI> If it is not received at all, it can have no &s;uch influence upon us; nor indeed can it, unle&s;s it is received with that temper of mind, which our Saviour and the Apo&s;tles always re|commend to us.</P>
<P>THESE things being premi&s;ed, whoever at|tends to the thing, will ea&s;ily &s;ee that a per&s;on who runs to every <HI>exce&s;s of riot</HI> and debauchery; one who <HI>commits iniquity with greedine&s;s;</HI> and &s;ays no re&s;traints upon him&s;elf; that has no <HI>fear of God before his eyes;</HI> nor any awakened &s;en&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="007488_0061_102B8FF76C26D758">
of religion; that &s;uch a per&s;on, I &s;ay, is not in a <HI>pre&s;ent capacity</HI> for receiving the Go&s;pel, in the manner it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be received, in order to its being to him "the power of God unto &s;alvation". There is a certain preparation, or previous qualification for entertaining this hea|venly doctrine, of which he is de&s;titute. Per&s;ons who are all immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;uality and vice; tho&s;e in who&s;e mortal bodies &s;in reigns triumphant; and who&s;e very "mind and con&s;cience is defiled," mu&s;t be reformed in <HI>&s;ome degree,</HI> and brought to more &s;ober reflection, before they either will, or can in the nature of the thing, give &s;uch a meek and cordial reception to the ingrafted word, as is requi&s;ite in order to their being &s;aved by it.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;trong antipathy in a man who is under the government of pride and &s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts, to the doctrines and precepts of the Go&s;pel: So that he cannot in a moment, bring him&s;elf to a proper temper of mind to receive it, tho' he were de&s;irous of it. He has that <HI>carnal mind</HI> which is <HI>enmity again&s;t God;</HI> which is not <HI>&s;ubject to his laws,</HI> neither indeed <HI>can be:</HI> So that they who are thus <HI>in the fle&s;h,</HI> are not in an immediate ca|pacity to <HI>plea&s;e God,</HI> by receiving his word with meekne&s;s; much le&s;s, by the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e virtues and graces which good men are the &s;ub|jects of. They who&s;e great concern it is, "to make provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof"; they that do not "hunger and thir&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="007488_0062_102B8FF99F588D28">
after righteou&s;ne&s;s"; they that have no concern for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls; but give full &s;cope to their vicious inclinations; the&s;e per&s;ons, con|tinuing &s;uch, cannot, by any means, be &s;uppo|&s;ed to be in a condition for receiving the word; they cannot receive it with that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, with that humility and meekne&s;s, with that love to the truth, with that hearty de&s;ire of improvement, with which it is to be received by all, in order to it's grand de&s;ign being an&s;wered upon them. No; 'til their con&s;ciences are alarmed; 'til they &s;ee in &s;ome mea&s;ure the folly and danger of &s;in, 'til they find &s;ome inclination to turn from it to God, that they may obtain his favour, and life e|ternal, they will not truly <HI>receive</HI> the Go&s;pel into their hearts; tho' they may hear it with their ears from day to day.</P>
<P>VICE, when indulged to a great degree, puts a &s;trong, tho' &s;ometimes an unperceived, un&s;u&s;|pected, bya&s;s upon the human mind; &s;o that &s;ome per&s;ons who imagine they hear with all due candor, impartiality and meekne&s;s, are very far from it in reality; hearing with great prejudice, and a &s;ecret di&s;gu&s;t, which prevents it's taking root in their hearts, and producing the good fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Any one that plea&s;es, may &s;ee that this is a &s;entiment which runs thro' the &s;criptures, and which often occurs in the new-te&s;tament more particularly. Thus our Sa|viour &s;ays, that "he that doeth evil, hateth the
<PB N="57" REF="007488_0063_102B8FFB284D0C10">
light, and will not come to the light, le&s;t his deeds which are evil &s;hould be reproved". Ac|cordingly he applies to the vicious and hardened <HI>Jews</HI> of his time, the emphatical words of the prophet&mdash;"In them, &s;ays he, is fulfilled the prophecy of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, <HI>By hearing ye &s;hall hear and &s;hall not under&s;tand; and &s;eeing, ye &s;hall &s;ee, and &s;hall not perceive. For this peo|ple's heart is waxed gro&s;s; and their ears are dull of hearing; and their eyes they have clo&s;ed, le&s;t at any time they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears; and &s;hould under&s;tand with their heart; and &s;hould be converted, and I &s;hould heal them.</HI>" Conformably hereto the A|po&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome, to whom the go&s;pel is <HI>hid;</HI> and tells us <HI>who</HI> they are. "If our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t; in whom the god of this world has blinded the eyes of them that believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious Go&s;|pel&mdash;&s;hould &s;hine unto them." So in the well-known parable of the &s;ower, the <HI>good &s;eed</HI> is repre&s;ented as taking effect, and producing fruit to purpo&s;e, only when it fell upon <HI>good ground,</HI> adapted and prepared to receive it; <HI>i. e.</HI> accor|ding to our Lord's own explanation, the word &s;own takes effect only in tho&s;e who receive it into an <HI>hone&s;t and good heart.</HI> There is a degree of integrity, hone&s;ty and uprightne&s;s, previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a cordial and effectual re|ceiving of the go&s;pel, according to our Saviour's
<PB N="58" REF="007488_0064_102B8FFD33266410">
doctrine. Tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of this, being wholly &s;unk into vice and voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, will not hear to purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e who have that tem|per which our Saviour expre&s;&s;es by an <HI>hone&s;t and good heart,</HI> he el&s;ewhere &s;tyles <HI>his &s;heep;</HI> antece|dently to their actually believing in him; and a&s;&s;ures us that they will <HI>hear his voice and follow him.</HI> And in conformity to this principle, we are to under&s;tand tho&s;e words of our Lord, which &s;o often occur in his di&s;cour&s;es.&mdash;"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Let tho&s;e hear, who have in them the principles of recovery; tho&s;e who are not &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of religion and virtue, as to be pa&s;t it.</P>
<P>IT is not much to be wondered at, if re&s;olved hardened tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; if tho&s;e who commit in|quity with greedine&s;s, rolling it as a &s;weet mor&s;el under their tongue; if tho&s;e who are given up to all <HI>filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s;</HI> it is not to be wondered at, if &s;uch abandoned &s;inners often hear the go&s;pel of the kingdom, without receiving any con&s;iderable benefit from it. They are not at pre&s;ent, proper matter for it to work upon. Tho' they hear the truth, and the doctrines of &s;alvation, they cannot receive it in the love of it, <HI>having plea&s;ure only in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> They are &s;tupi|fied with the poi&s;onous draught, which they have taken. And the word is no &s;ooner heard perhaps, than it is forgotten, and &s;natched away from them, as it were by &s;ome evil, malicious &s;pirit; &s;natched
<PB N="59" REF="007488_0065_102B8FFF47425A48">
away, like the <HI>&s;eed</HI> which fell by the <HI>way &s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>The mind that is carnalized, and depraved to the degree that is here intended, is moreover a very unfit habitation for the Holy Spirit of God; without who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed influences, the &s;eed &s;own in our hearts, does never take root and bring forth fruit. In the language of the book of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> <Q>Froward thoughts &s;eparate from God&mdash;[And] Into a malicious &s;oul wi&s;dom &s;hall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is &s;ubject unto &s;in: For the Holy Spirit of di&s;cipline will flee de|ceit; and remove from thoughts that are with|out under&s;tanding; and will not abide when unrighteou&s;ne&s;s cometh in.</Q> That pure di|vine truth, which we do not love; that Spirit of grace and di&s;cipline, which we quench and grieve, by the habitual indulgence of our &s;en&s;ual appetites, cannot but be unwelcome gue&s;ts to our &s;ouls, thus deba&s;ed and imbruted. This <Q>&s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s, and the &s;pirit that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience;</Q> throw a thick veil over the human mind; and unite in darken|ing and blinding it. They extingui&s;h every di|vine ray, 'ere it can pierce the gloom; and put out that candle of the Lord, which was originally lighted up in our hearts to guide us to Him. They de&s;troy our natural &s;en&s;e and feeling of moral and religious truths; and e&s;pecially all the mental faculties, however bright before. They hebetate and blunt all the noble powers of the
<PB N="60" REF="007488_0066_102B900125043A10">
&s;oul; and render it un&s;u&s;ceptiable of good im|pre&s;&s;ions. They de&s;troy all reli&s;h of intellectual and &s;piritual enjoyments; and take away the heart from God; from his word and in&s;titutions; and even from tho&s;e things which the light of nature &s;trongly recommends to the love and practice of all men, who have not thus abu&s;ed and perverted their minds. And when the light that is in us, is thus turned into darkne&s;s, thro' long, invetrate habits of &s;inning again&s;t the light, "how great is that darkne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Is it very &s;trange, if &s;uch abandoned &s;inners do not receive with <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> the ingrafted word? Is it to be wondered at, if per&s;ons &s;o intirely un|der the dominion of fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, and the God of this world; per&s;ons thus lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of virtue and religion; &s;hould have their minds blinded to &s;uch a degree, that the Go&s;pel is hid from them; not being able to &s;hine thro' &s;uch a thick, gro&s;s and impure <HI>medium,</HI> into their hearts, "to give them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?" No &s;urely; if they do not admit, but exclude this heavenly light, it is what might be expected. For it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary in the nature of the thing, that men &s;hould be awakened to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of religion; that they &s;hould be brought to &s;ober reflection; and deve&s;t them&s;elves, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the gro&s;&s;er habits of &s;in and vice, previou&s;ly to the word's being ingrafted into their hearts &s;o effec|tually
<PB N="61" REF="007488_0067_102B912F074F7D90">
as to transform them into the divine like|ne&s;s; and cau&s;e them to bring forth fruit unto God. The light of rea&s;on mu&s;t be permitted to &s;hine into our hearts, before the light of revelation can be cordially received; the voice of natural con&s;cience mu&s;t be heard, and li&s;tened to, before the voice of God in his word will be duly regar|ded: We cannot be <HI>chri&s;tians</HI> in temper and conduct, without being fir&s;t <HI>&s;ober</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> in our lives, without fir&s;t <HI>laying apart all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s,</HI> and ab&s;taining from gro&s;s vice and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s. This is a nece&s;&s;ary preparation for, and the fir&s;t &s;tep towards, our becoming <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in reality; and being "holy in all manner of conver&s;ation and godline&s;s."</P>
<P>IT is not only tho&s;e which are peculiarly ter|med <HI>&s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts,</HI> that &s;tupify the con&s;ciences of men, and indi&s;po&s;e them for receiving the truth in the love of it. All other kinds of gro&s;s im|moral indulgence, have a &s;imilar tendency to ren|der the heart callous; and in&s;en&s;ible to the im|pre&s;&s;ions of evangelical truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. All kinds of vice in general, are contrary to that religion, which is <HI>pure and undefiled before God.</HI> So that tho&s;e who give the reins to any known and heinous &s;in; tho&s;e who <HI>&s;ell them&s;elves to do any kind of iniquity,</HI> cannot reli&s;h <HI>the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</HI> Both the doctrines and duties of Chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t needs be di&s;gu&s;tful to their depraved and vitiated ta&s;te: And it is at lea&s;t
<PB N="62" REF="007488_0068_102B84A61EDDDB00">
morally, if not naturally impo&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould receive the Go&s;pel into their hearts, 'till &s;uch time as they renounce all gro&s;s immoralities; 'till they come to be tho'tful and &s;erious; and are heartily de&s;irous to know "the things that be|long to their peace."</P>
<P>No man can &s;incerely and cordially embrace the go&s;pel, while he remains hardened in &s;in; and is unconcerned about his &s;alvation. The re|ceiving of it with meekne&s;s, pre&s;uppo&s;es that a per&s;on's con&s;cience is awakened; that he is &s;en&s;i|ble of his &s;ins; that he is &s;orry for them, willing to for&s;ake them, and to become the &s;ervant of God and righteou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis prepo&s;terou&s;ly ab|&s;urd to think that any one can properly receive the ingrafted word; or "believe to the &s;aving of his &s;oul," before he is brought to &s;uch a temper of mind; or while he per&s;everes in his tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, with a &s;eared con&s;cience, having no <HI>fear of God before their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be objected, perhaps, that the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity, is to reform a vicious, de|generate world: And if &s;o, the mo&s;t corrupt and abandoned men, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be got beyond the reach of it; &s;ince God undoubtedly accommodates all means to the ends propo&s;ed in them. Whereas in what has been &s;aid above, the Go&s;pel is &s;uppo&s;ed to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted and accommo|dated only to the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are the <HI>lea&s;t corrupted</HI> and <HI>depraved;</HI> while tho&s;e who are the
<PB N="63" REF="007488_0069_102B84A7A710A7F8">
<HI>mo&s;t</HI> abandoned, and who con&s;equently <HI>mo&s;t need</HI> to be reclaimed from the error of their ways, are not in a capacity of receiving it in &s;uch a manner as is nece&s;&s;ary to that end. If only tho&s;e who have already put away <HI>all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s,</HI> can receive the word with <HI>meek|ne&s;s,</HI> &s;o as to be &s;aved by it; the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be quite u&s;ele&s;s to a great, if not the greate&s;t part of mankind; and it is to no purpo&s;e to preach it to them.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that to &s;ay a man is not in a <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> temper and di&s;po&s;ition to give that humble and meek reception to the go&s;pel, which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being &s;aved by it at la&s;t; is quite a different thing from &s;aying, that he can receive <HI>no good</HI> at all from it; and that it mu&s;t prove a <HI>u&s;ele&s;s, dead letter to him.</HI> The&s;e things are very di&s;tinct; nor does the latter follow from the former, by natural deduction and inference. For altho' &s;ome per&s;ons, by rea&s;on of their great wickedne&s;s, and hardne&s;s of heart, are not in an immediate and pre&s;ent capacity to embrace the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, with that &s;incerity and humility, which is nece&s;&s;ary before the de&s;ign of it can be fully an&s;wered upon them; yet by hearing it from time to time, they may, with the ordinary ble&s;&s;|ing of God, and that grace of His, which always accompanies the word preached, be awakened out of their fatal &s;lumber; and in the language of &s;cripture, <HI>pricked in their hearts,</HI> &s;o as to be &s;e|riou&s;ly
<PB N="64" REF="007488_0070_102B84A991F0E540">
inqui&s;itive, <HI>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved?</HI> In other words, the go&s;pel may take hold of their hearts to &s;uch a degree, as to convince them of the folly and danger of going on in their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions; and make them heartily &s;ollicitous to <HI>fly from the wrath to come;</HI> and to obtain eternal life. And when per&s;ons are thus &s;topped in their mad career; brought to think upon their ways; and made &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive about their &s;alva|tion; then it is, that they have the temper of mind with which the Go&s;pel ought to be received, tho' they had it not before.</P>
<P>WHAT I intend, is this, That altho' no man who is gro&s;ly vicious and immoral; that is &s;ecure and unconcerned; that &s;ins with an <HI>high hand;</HI> boldly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of God, and violating the law of his mind; that tho' no &s;uch per&s;on, I &s;ay, is now in a temper of mind for receiving the go&s;pel as it mu&s;t needs be received, before the full de&s;ign of it can be an&s;wered upon him; yet he may po&s;&s;ibly hear it &s;o as to bring him to that temper. In which re&s;pect, the Word preach|ed may be beneficial to the wor&s;t of men, as well as to the le&s;s abandoned: For &s;urely it is &s;o to all whom it rouzes from their lethargy in &s;in, to &s;ober thoughtfulne&s;s and reflection; producing &s;ome reformation in them, tho' at pre&s;ent very imperfect. Our Saviour pronounces <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> not only tho&s;e who are already <HI>filled with righteou&s;|ne&s;s;</HI> but al&s;o tho&s;e who <HI>hunger and thir&s;t</HI> after
<PB N="65" REF="007488_0071_102B84AB189601A0">
it; becau&s;e they are in a hopeful and probable way to be filled. By &s;uch, the go&s;pel will be re|ceived in a manner &s;utable to the de&s;ign of it: They are prepared to have it actually <HI>ingrafted</HI> into their hearts; and it is to be hoped, that He <HI>who has</HI> thus, by his word and &s;pirit, <HI>begun a good work in them, will perfect it unto the day of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THUS is the go&s;pel calculated for the good of all. Tho&s;e who are not depraved to a great de|gree, will of cour&s;e receive it, and be truly good and virtuous by it. And even the more vicious and abandoned part of mankind, may be awaken|ed and influenced by it to &s;uch a degree as &s;hall make them de&s;irous of relinqui&s;hing their former &s;ins, and <HI>turning their feet into God's te&s;timonies;</HI> that &s;o they may obtain the pardon and &s;alvation offered to &s;inners in it. And tho&s;e who are brought to this temper of mind, will then of cour&s;e receive the &s;piritual and incorruptable &s;eed into their hearts, as into <HI>good ground,</HI> into a &s;oil prepared for, and adapted to it. In con&s;e|quence of which they will "bring forth fruit, &s;ome thirty, &s;ome &s;ixty, and &s;ome an hundred fold."</P>
<P>BUT alas! it was never &s;uppo&s;ed that the go&s;pel, however <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> would prove <HI>effectual</HI> in the event, for the reformation and &s;alvation of all tho&s;e to whom it is preached. Many of tho&s;e to whom it was preached of old, as it is to us now,
<PB N="66" REF="007488_0072_102B84B678EEEF98">

For he then told them what &s;hould be the portion of tho&s;e who <HI>believed not,</HI> as well as of tho&s;e who believed, and gave heed to their doctrine.

<P>LET me conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, with a few &s;hort reflections.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts to us the wi&s;dom of applying our&s;elves to the concerns of religion, and another world, in youth, before the habits of &s;in and vice, are become &s;trong and inveterate. Per&s;ons u&s;ually wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, 'til &s;uch time as they begin to reform and grow better: The farther we proceed in the paths of iniquity, by &s;o much more difficult will it be for us to re|treat; to receive the go&s;pel of the kingdom into our hearts; and to become Chri&s;t's true di&s;ci|ples; his loyal &s;ubjects. Such is the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, that it &s;teals upon us unawares, and hardens us by in&s;en&s;ible degrees; 'til in proce&s;s of time, it takes a deep and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of us, &s;o that it is as ea&s;y for "the <HI>AEthiopian</HI> to change <HI>his &s;kin,</HI> or the <HI>Leopard his &s;pots,</HI>" as for us, thus <HI>accu&s;tomed to do evil,</HI> to <HI>learn to do well.</HI> So that tho&s;e who do not in early life, remember their Creator, and receive the Go&s;pel of their Re|deemer with <HI>meekne&s;s;</HI> may come at length to receive it with mockery and deri&s;ion; "crucifying

to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put|ting him to an open &s;hame:" To whom there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;in." And thus the go&s;pel which was <HI>ordained unto life,</HI> proves only <HI>the &s;avour of death unto death.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. LET us not conclude that we are true Chri&s;|tians, and intitled to the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel, merely becau&s;e we are not flagrantly immoral and vicious in our lives. For altho' we may, in the &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle, have <HI>laid apart all filthi|ne&s;s, and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s;</HI> we may yet fall &s;hort of that <HI>holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> The go&s;pel has not an&s;wered it's de&s;ign upon us, 'til we have &s;o received the <HI>truth</HI> into our hearts, as to be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> by it; 'til we are "transformed by the renewing of our minds, and the wa&s;hing of the Holy Gho&s;t," into the image of God and of our Saviour. This is the great end propo&s;ed in the go&s;pel; in order where|unto, it is to be meekly hearkened to from time to time; it mu&s;t be <HI>ingrafted</HI> into our hearts; and incorporated, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, with our very &s;ouls and natures&mdash;But I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak more upon this point hereafter, in another di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

If your own hearts condemn you, as habitual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of God's commandments, remember that "He is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things;" and that He "now commandeth all men every where to repent, for that he hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s." We are apt to be partial to our&s;elves; to make too favoura|ble allowances; to make the be&s;t of every thing, on our own &s;ide. But if, notwith&s;tanding this natural propen&s;ity to think and judge favourably of our&s;elves, our own hearts &s;till mi&s;give and condemn us; how much more &s;urely will that God condemn us, who is greater than our hearts? Who is no re&s;pector of per&s;ons? and who&s;e judg|ment is always according to truth?</P>
<P>BE a&s;&s;ured, that while you are knowingly and habitually guilty of any immoral practices, you

<HEAD>SERMON IV. Upon the Nece&s;&s;ity of yielding a practical Obedience to the Go&s;pel, in order to obtaining the Salvation propo&s;ed in it.</HEAD>

<Q><HI>LAY apart all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naugh|tine&s;s, and receive with meekne&s;s the ingrafted word, which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, de|ceiving your own &s;elves.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is unque&s;tionably the duty of all Chri&s;tians to be <HI>hearers</HI> of the word read and preached in the a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;aints; this being a divine in&s;titution: As was &s;hown in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> di&s;|cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>next,</HI> the duty of <HI>receiving</HI> the word with <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> was more particularly con&s;idered, and inforced.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="007488_0080_102B9003B3BCDF80">
IT was &s;hown in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> di&s;cour&s;e, That in order to our receiving the word in a &s;utable man|ner, &s;o that the de&s;ign of it may be an&s;wered up|on us, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we <HI>lay apart all filthi|ne&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s;</HI> or in other words, that we renounce vice and immorality in all its <HI>gro&s;&s;er forms.</HI> It is not po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who are regardle&s;s even of <HI>natural</HI> religion; and who are given over to work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s; it is not po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch abandoned &s;inners, continuing &s;uch, to receive the <HI>revealed</HI> word of God with a proper temper of mind. They are not in a pre&s;ent capacity for giving a due reception to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. There is &s;omewhat previou&s;ly requi&s;ite, or preparatory, thereto; which is, that they relinqui&s;h their bru|tal lu&s;ts, and all gro&s;s immoralities; and are heartily de&s;irous of being taught the way that leads to eternal life: Then, and not before, are per&s;ons capable of giving that cordial and meek reception to the ingrafted word, which is required in order to the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;hort view of the &s;ubject, &s;o far as it has been treated already: And the next thing in cour&s;e, according to the method propo&s;ed, is to &s;how,</P>
<P><HI>FOURTHLY,</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>obeying</HI> the Go&s;pel, in order to our receiving the &s;alvation of it. The apo&s;tle tells us, that <HI>the ingrafted word is</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="007488_0081_102B900542C25450">
<HI>able to &s;ave our &s;ouls:</HI> But immediately &s;ubjoins, <Q>But be ye <HI>doers</HI> of the word, and not <HI>hearers only,</HI> deceiving your own &s;elves.</Q> q.d. "God having revealed to you the way of life and &s;alva|tion, it behoves you carefully to hearken to this revelation, and meekly to receive it. But I warn you again&s;t &s;o fatal an error as this, that barely hearing the Go&s;pel of the kingdom, without o|beying it, will intitle you to that &s;alvation which is revealed to &s;inners therein. You will gro&s;ly and fatally delude your &s;elves, if you expect &s;al|vation upon any other terms, than tho&s;e of con|forming your tempers and manners to the rules of life contained in this revelation, which you hear, and profe&s;s to receive."</P>
<P>IT will be apparent to every one who carefully looks into this Epi&s;tle, that St. <HI>James,</HI> the author of it, de&s;ignedly combates &s;ome libertine notions of Chri&s;tianity, which began in tho&s;e early times, to creep into the church; which notions when|ever, and wherever they prevail, mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel; which is to make men truly good and virtuous here, in order to their being happy hereafter.</P>
<P>IT is indeed &s;trange that all men, even upon the mo&s;t &s;light and cur&s;ory view of Chri&s;tianity, as it is delivered to us in the <HI>new te&s;tament,</HI> &s;hould not immediately &s;ee that it is <HI>a doctrine according to Godline&s;s,</HI> not a doctrine of <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that the great aim of it, is to make us fear and love
<PB N="76" REF="007488_0082_102B9006F7405538">
God, and work righteou&s;ne&s;s; that it promi&s;es eternal life only to the pure in heart, and holy in all manner of conver&s;ation; and that it is &s;o far from giving wicked men, continuing &s;uch, any hopes of pardon and &s;alvation, that it a&s;&s;ures them of the contrary, in the mo&s;t plain, &s;trong and emphatical terms. It is very &s;trange that every one &s;hould not at once &s;ee that this is the real truth of the ca&s;e; without attempting to evade the matter by any kind of di&s;tinctions or refine|ments. But alas! &s;o devoted are &s;ome men to their lu&s;ts, and at the fame &s;o loth to renounce all the hopes of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality, that they will endeavour to make a life of &s;in and di&s;obedi|ence, no in&s;uperable ob&s;truction or bar, in the way of their &s;alvation; &s;peaking peace to them|&s;elves while they are walking in the paths of de|&s;truction, and the mo&s;t certain, inevitable ruin. Thus it is that &s;ome per&s;ons in every age and country, &s;ince the Go&s;pel has been promulgated to the world, have been <HI>deceiving their own &s;elves;</HI> by imagining, that the being <HI>doers of the word,</HI> was not really nece&s;&s;ary in order to the obtaining of God's favour, and future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I am to &s;how in general in this di&s;cour&s;e, the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the Go&s;pel in order to our being intitled to the &s;alvation of it: leaving &s;ome of the mo&s;t common mi&s;takes and errors concerning this important point, to be <HI>more particularly</HI> con&s;idered and refuted hereafter.
<PB N="77" REF="007488_0083_102B9009D6483558">
And that all &s;uch notions in general, are vain and delu&s;ory; that the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be <HI>obeyed,</HI> as well as heard and received; and that no incor|rigible &s;inner &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God; appears, in the <HI>first</HI> place,</P>
<P>FROM a general view of Chri&s;tianity, as con|taining <HI>precepts</HI> and <HI>commandments,</HI> given for the regulating of our <HI>conduct,</HI> as well as <HI>principles</HI> and <HI>doctrines,</HI> for the regulating of our <HI>faith.</HI> Whoever looks into the new te&s;tament, will find <HI>there</HI> a &s;y&s;tem of religion, which con&s;i&s;ts partly of doctrinal truths to be a&s;&s;ented to, and partly of commands, pre&s;cribing to us what is to be done; the former being u&s;ually called the <HI>Cre|denda,</HI> the latter, the <HI>Agenda</HI> of religion. It is not more plain and evident, that Chri&s;tianity con|tains certain principles that are to be believed; principles re&s;pecting the nature and moral govern|ment of God; the per&s;on and offices of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a future exi&s;tence; the re&s;urrection of the body; a judgment to come; and a &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments to &s;ucceed; (this is not more evident, I &s;ay) than that the &s;ame reli|gion contains a great variety of precepts, injunctions and prohibitions, delivered to us as to creatures that have <HI>a part to act;</HI> precepts re&s;pecting our behaviour towards God, towards our Redeemer, towards our neighbour; and &s;ome that more im|mediately re&s;pect the government of our&s;elves. In other words, it is not le&s;s certain and obvious,
<PB N="78" REF="007488_0084_102B900B5DDE6490">
that the go&s;pel con&s;iders us as active moral Crea|tures, who&s;e hearts and manners are to be formed and regulated by the laws therein contained; than that it con&s;iders us as intellectual Creatures, who ought to receive and embrace the truths that are therein revealed to our under&s;tandings. It being evident then, from the mo&s;t cur&s;ory view of Chri&s;tianity, that it is not only a rule of <HI>faith,</HI> but of <HI>practice</HI> al&s;o; it is as certain, that we are obliged to <HI>obey</HI> it, con&s;idered in the latter of the&s;e re&s;pects, as that we are bound to <HI>believe</HI> it, con|&s;idered in the former. No one can &s;how, that we are more &s;trongly obligated to believe what God has revealed, than we are to do what he has required. He is doubtle&s;s as ju&s;t in his com|mands, as he is true and faithful in his words and promi&s;es: Nor can his Authority be more pro|perly called in que&s;tion in one ca&s;e, than his vera|city in the other. From hence it appears, that we are no le&s;s bound to be <HI>doers of the word,</HI> than we are to be <HI>hearers</HI> and <HI>believers</HI> of it. All the laws which God has given us, were given that they might be ob&s;erved; not that they might be broken. And indeed if they may be di&s;regarded with impunity; I &s;ee not why it is nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould even be believers. For it is to be re|membred, that tho' this is one of God's com|mandments, <HI>that we believe in him whom he hath &s;ent;</HI> yet it is not <HI>more truly one of them,</HI> than this, that we <HI>love</HI> Him, and <HI>love</HI> our neighbour.
<PB N="79" REF="007488_0085_102B900D43D40E88">
And why that command, by which <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith</HI> is in|joined upon us, may not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and &s;et a&s;ide as being of no con&s;equence; as well as &s;ome other commandments of the Go&s;pel, no one can a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on. So that if we may be &s;aved without <HI>doing the word,</HI> I am bold to a&s;&s;ert we may be &s;aved without <HI>believing</HI> or <HI>receiving</HI> it. God requires the latter no more plainly and peremptorily than he does the other. And as &s;oon as any one will &s;how how we may be intitled to &s;alvation, without obedience; I will &s;how, at lea&s;t by &s;imilar, if not by the &s;ame Arguments, how we may be intitled thereto, without believ|ing one &s;yllable of the Chri&s;tian revelation, with whatever evidence of its truth it may come to us.</P>
<P>WE may con&s;ider, the matter in a differ|ent point of light, which will bring us to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion at la&s;t.&mdash;We are the profe&s;&s;ed <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> of Chri&s;t, acknowleding him for our <HI>teacher, ma&s;|ter</HI> and <HI>lord.</HI> We are therefore to con&s;ider what &s;ort of <HI>teacher</HI> he was; what he undertook to in&s;truct men in in; order to know whether we really come up to the character of his di&s;|ciples, or fall &s;hort of it. There have been differ|ent kinds of teachers in the world; and &s;till are. Some in&s;truct in one art or &s;cience, &s;ome in another. Now our Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, came into the world, as a teacher of true religion. He came to make known to us many divine truths; tho&s;e things that belong to our peace;
<PB N="80" REF="007488_0086_102B900EDCED4600">
and to in&s;truct us how to &s;erve God in this World, in order to our being happy in his favour in the world to come. Here his teachings and in&s;truc|tions all terminate, as to the end of them. Now a <HI>di&s;ciple</HI> of any one, is he that learns of him that &s;cience, art or bu&s;ine&s;s, of which he is the pro|fe&s;&s;ed teacher. He that does &s;o, is truly and pro|perly a di&s;ciple; otherwi&s;e he is only a nominal one. A per&s;on, in ancient times, would not have been deemed a di&s;ciple of <HI>Socrates,</HI> while he lived after the principles and maxims of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> altho' he frequented the &s;chool of the former, and not of the latter. Let him have called him&s;elf by what name he would, others would reckon him a di&s;ciple either of one or of the other, according to the principles which he embibed, and the maxims of living, which he embraced and fol|lowed. How then, does <HI>he</HI> come up to the character of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple, who does not learn of him, that temper and behaviour, that art of holy and virtuous living, which Chri&s;t came to teach; and which is indeed the &s;ame thing with that practical obedience to the word, the nece&s;&s;ity of which I am now endeavouring to &s;how? Tho&s;e who live and act according to other rules and maxims, than tho&s;e of our divine ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, cannot, with truth and propriety, be &s;tyled his di&s;ciples and followers, any more than an <HI>Epicurean</HI> Voluptuary could be called a di&s;ciple of <HI>Socrates</HI> or <HI>Plato.</HI></P>

INDEED if the whole, or principal de&s;ign of our Saviour, in taking upon him&s;elf the character and office of a teacher, had been <HI>to give us a Creed;</HI> or to in&s;truct us in certain religious notions and principles, without referring them to prac|tice; we might, in that ca&s;e, be called his di&s;|ciples, if we embraced tho&s;e principles, however flagitious we might be in our lives and manners. But when we reflect, that the le&s;&s;on which Chri&s;t came to teach us, re&s;pects the regulation of our hearts, tempers and behaviour; that the great aim of all his in&s;tructions, is to reclaim men from their evil and vicious cour&s;es; and to bring them to a re&s;emblance of the divine purity, goodne&s;s and holine&s;s, in order to their being happy here|after; when we reflect, I &s;ay, that Chri&s;t's doc|trines and in&s;tructions all terminate in this point, it is manife&s;t that tho&s;e who call them&s;elves his di&s;ciples, without departing from iniquity, and living as he has taught them to live, compliment them&s;elves with a name, which does not belong to them; and have no nea&s;on to expect any good will finally accrue to them from his media|tion. They are de&s;titute of the main, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic, of Chri&s;tians; which is a temper and behaviour corre&s;ponding to the maxims and precepts of Chri&s;t's religion; and to that example which he has left us, <HI>that we might follow his &s;teps.</HI></P>
<P>AGREABLY to what is here &s;aid, we often find
<PB N="82" REF="007488_0088_102B901348FCACA8">
our Saviour reproving the incon&s;i&s;tency and ab&s;ur|dity of tho&s;e, who, while they acknowledge him for their Lord, do not walk according to his injunc|tions. "Why call ye me, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> &s;ays he, and <HI>do not</HI> the things which I &s;ay." q. d. "With what propriety, with what mode&s;ty, can you own &s;uch a relation to me, as that of di&s;ciples to a ma&s;ter and Lord, while you do not demean your&s;elves an&s;werably thereto? While you give no heed to my words and coun&s;els; but &s;et them at naught? Either live according to the&s;e rules which I teach and pre&s;cribe; or cea&s;e to mock me, and to delude your&s;elves, by calling me your Lord"</P>
<P>AT another time, when our Saviour was &s;peak|ing of him&s;elf as one divinely authori&s;ed to draw di&s;ciples and followers after him; and accordingly invited people to <HI>come unto him,</HI> and to <HI>learn of</HI> him; this was not &s;o much, that they might be in|&s;tructed in certain &s;peculative truths, as that they might learn the art of governing their tempers, and living well. "Come unto me, &s;ays he,&mdash;take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye &s;hall find re&s;t unto your &s;ouls." We here &s;ee, that tho' by coming to Chri&s;t, is intended receiving him in the character of a divine teacher; yet this is in order to a farther end; which is, &s;ubmitting to be directed by him in the way to happine&s;s. There is no <HI>coming,</HI> or <HI>going</HI> to Chri&s;t, to any good pur|po&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="007488_0089_102B9014D2A7BDD8">
without <HI>taking his yoke</HI> upon us, and learn|ing of him to be <HI>meek and lowly in heart.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole then, Chri&s;tianity appears to be a practical &s;cience; the art of living piou&s;ly and virtuou&s;ly. The drift and &s;cope of our great ma&s;ter's doctrine and preaching, was to make us abandon our &s;ins and lu&s;ts of every kind; and to form us to a re&s;emblance of him&s;elf, who is <HI>the image of the invi&s;ible God.</HI> Tho&s;e who do not learn of him to be &s;incerely good, learn nothing to pur|po&s;e; and <HI>know nothing as they ought to know it.</HI> We cannot be called his true di&s;ciples and follow|ers, without putting on that temper and be|haviour, which his laws and example recommend to us, or rather injoin upon us. And if we are not <HI>really</HI> his di&s;ciples, but are &s;o in <HI>name</HI> only, certainly we cannot hope for &s;alvation by him. So that con&s;idering the matter in this light, it is evidently nece&s;&s;ary that we <HI>obey</HI> the word, as well as hear and believe. And we do but <HI>deceive our own &s;elves,</HI> if we expect to be &s;aved upon any ea&s;ier terms.</P>
<P>BUT for the farther confirmation of the point before us, let me produce two or three pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, wherein the end of Chri&s;t's coming into the world, and of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is more explicitly declared. Our Saviour tells us, that he came "to call &s;inners to repentance." <HI>St. Paul</HI> &s;ays, that he "gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
<PB N="84" REF="007488_0090_102B901747748220">
unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works." The &s;ame apo&s;tle tells us, that the grace of God has appeared unto us, "teaching us that, denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world." <HI>St. John</HI> tells us, that who&s;e com|mitteth &s;in, is of the Devil; and that "for this purpo&s;e the Son of God was manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the Devil." And we know, that our Lord was called <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> becau&s;e he was to "&s;ave his people from their &s;ins." From the&s;e and &s;uch-like pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, the nece&s;&s;ity of departing from iniquity, and of obey|ing the go&s;pel, is manife&s;t. Surely that cannot be looked upon as unnece&s;&s;ary, which is thus de|clared to be one great end of our Lord's mani|fe&s;tation in the fle&s;h. But how is this declared end of the go&s;pel, and the grace of God appear|ing therein, an&s;wered upon us, if we per&s;evere in our evil ways, in&s;tead of being led to repentance? If we indulge to ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, in&s;tead of denying them? If we are zealous of bad works, in&s;tead of good? If the works of the Devil are practi&s;ed by us, in&s;tead of being de&s;troy|ed in us? If we remain under the dominion and power of &s;in, in&s;tead of being made free from it, and becoming the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s? Can any one imagine that the true intent and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's go&s;pel is an&s;wered upon them, before they "cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well?"
<PB N="85" REF="007488_0091_102B901976C43F98">
Certainly no vicious, unrighteous man, is what the Go&s;pel is intended to make him: No per&s;on of this character, has complied with the true and declared de&s;ign of this di&s;pen&s;ation of the grace of God. And if not, is it not manife&s;tly ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a one, can be intitled to the &s;alvation revealed therein? Why may not a vicious <HI>Heathen,</HI> who never heard of the go&s;|pel, be intitled to the ble&s;&s;ings of it, as well as a vicious <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> on whom it has had no effect? and who is as wicked, perhaps, if not more wicked, than he would have been, if this grace had never appeared to him? Will not a profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian, who has not really complied with the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, any more than a <HI>Pagan,</HI> be as certainly condemned hereafter, as if he had been a <HI>Pagan</HI> him&s;elf? It does not appear from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that any good &s;hall finally re&s;ult to tho&s;e who hear the go&s;pel, but in proportion as they are made really better by it; having fallen in, and concurred with the de&s;ign of God's grace revealed to us therein.</P>
<P>WE may con&s;ider this matter &s;till in another light; which will farther evince the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the word. The Go&s;pel informs us, that in order to our &s;alvation, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be <HI>born again; born of God; born of the &s;pirit;</HI> that we <HI>put off the old man with his deeds;</HI> that we <HI>put on the new man;</HI> that we <HI>walk in the &s;pirit,</HI> and <HI>bring forth the fruits of the &s;pirit;</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="007488_0092_102B901B04D66358">
and the like. Now I would a&s;k, what is the meaning of all the&s;e phra&s;es? What is the true import, and real amount of them? Is it not mani|fe&s;tly, this, that &s;inners mu&s;t, by the go&s;pel, and the co-operation of the &s;pirit and grace of God therewith, be turned from &s;in to righteou&s;|ne&s;s? that their hearts which were before corrupt, and e&s;tranged from God, mu&s;t be purified, and turned to him? And that, in con&s;equence hereof they "walk in all his commandments and ordi|nances blamele&s;s?" This is manife&s;tly that <HI>new birth,</HI> or <HI>regeneration; that putting off the old man with his deeds,</HI> and <HI>putting on the new man,</HI> of which the &s;criptures &s;peak: And the thing is in it&s;elf very plain and intelligible, how great a <HI>my&s;tery</HI> &s;oever, either the ancient or modern <HI>Nichodemus'</HI>s and <HI>ma&s;ters in I&s;rael,</HI> have made of it. If therefore, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a man be born again, in order to his &s;alvation; and if this is the proper notion of regeneration; then cer|tainly it is nece&s;&s;ary to obey the go&s;pel, in order to that end. For &s;uch a change of heart and man|ners, as is denoted by the terms <HI>born again,</HI> and <HI>born of the &s;pirit,</HI> implies and involves in it, the obedience here intended.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that &s;ome per&s;ons have invented another &s;ort of <HI>regeneration,</HI> which leaves the &s;ub|ject of it much as it found him,&mdash;"to every good work r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bate;" and which a man may <HI>experience,</HI> without being really any better than
<PB N="87" REF="007488_0093_102B901D912D7DD0">
he was before; any more like to God; any more ob&s;ervant of his laws. Yea, I wi&s;h there was not rea&s;on to &s;ay, that <HI>that</HI> which many have taken to be their <HI>regeneration,</HI> and a being <HI>filled with the &s;pirit,</HI> might be more properly called a <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;</HI> leaving them much wor&s;e than it found them; le&s;s careful to "order their conver&s;ation aright;" le&s;s ju&s;t, &s;ober, humble and charitable, than they were in what they called their carnal, unregene|rate, unconverted &s;tate. According to this No|tion of regeneration, I acknowledge that a per&s;on may be born again, and yet not become a <HI>doer of the word.</HI> But the &s;criptures know of no re|generation, be&s;ides that which con&s;i&s;ts in a real change of heart and manners, from &s;in and un|righteou&s;ne&s;s to holine&s;s; a regeneration, from which obedience to the laws of Chri&s;tianity is in&s;ep|arable; and with which, habitual &s;inning is ab&s;o|lutely incon&s;i&s;tent. "Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him; and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God." So that while we keep to <HI>this idea</HI> of regeneration, to &s;ay that it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be born again, is, in effect to &s;ay neither more nor le&s;s than this, that it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould become holy in heart and conver&s;ation, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance and grace; which is the &s;ame thing, in other words, with being <HI>doers of the word,</HI> or yielding a practical obedience to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. It is, therefore, to be hoped that none who a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="88" REF="007488_0094_102B901F194A5D80">
the nece&s;&s;ity of the former, will call in que&s;tion the nece&s;&s;ity of the latter.</P>
<P>IT may be added here, that the <HI>repentance</HI> of &s;inners is always &s;uppo&s;ed in the new te&s;tament, to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible condition of, and a meet qualification for, their receiving pardon and eter|nal life. But what is the proper notion or idea of evangelical repentance? of that repentance, with|out which &s;inners cannot be &s;aved? Is it only a fla&s;hly, &s;uperficial &s;orrow for &s;in? &s;uch a &s;orrow and contrition, as is con&s;i&s;tent with per&s;evering therein? Surely no. It involves in it a turning from &s;in, to God and righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is the active principle of a new life; a life of holine&s;s, and obedience to the divine commandments. The repentance which falls &s;hort of this; which leaves the heart un&s;ubdued to God; the repentance which leaves a &s;inner as it found him; and is not accompanied with a reformation of mind and manners; is not that <HI>repentance unto life,</HI> which is intended in the go&s;pel: It is a vain, ineffectual &s;orrow; and &s;carce better than that "&s;orrow of the world which worketh death." Now if this is the proper notion of repentance; or if repentance implies in it, a for&s;aking of our pa&s;t &s;ins, and en|tering upon a new cour&s;e of life; and if &s;uch re|pentance is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;alvation; then certainly the <HI>hearing</HI> of the word, without <HI>doing</HI> it, cannot intitle us to eternal life. Evangelical repentance is, in &s;hort, go&s;pel-obedience in its <HI>root</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="007488_0095_102B9020F59A1F48">
and <HI>principle;</HI> and wherever it is, it will bring forth the <HI>fruits</HI> that are <HI>meet</HI> for it. So that to a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, and yet to &s;up|po&s;e we may be &s;aved without obedience and righteou&s;ne&s;s, is a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity and contra|diction.</P>
<P>BUT let us con&s;ider a little more particularly, to whom it is that the go&s;pel it&s;elf promi&s;es eter|nal life; and whether the&s;e promi&s;es are not evi|dently re&s;trained and confined to obedient Chri&s;|tians; to the <HI>doers</HI> of the word. Now the Apo&s;|tle tells us, that Chri&s;t, "being made perfect be|came the author of eternal &s;alvation to <HI>all them that obey him.</HI>" Is there not here a plain limita|tion of that &s;alvation of which Chri&s;t is the author, to tho&s;e who do his commandments? Does not the form of expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed, manife&s;tly imply, that &s;uch as do not practically conform to the laws of Chri&s;t, as well as believe and tru&s;t in him, &s;hall not finally &s;hare in that redemption which he has wrought out? Again, our Saviour &s;ays, that the <HI>righteous</HI> "&s;hall go away into life eter|nal;" and that the <HI>righteous</HI> &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father." Is the &s;ame ever &s;aid in &s;cripture, of the wicked and di&s;|obedient? Or of all men in common without any di&s;criminating mark? Again, our Lord likens tho&s;e who hear his &s;ayings, and <HI>do them,</HI> to "a wi&s;e man that built his hou&s;e upon a rock," which would not fall. But does he make u&s;e of the
<PB N="90" REF="007488_0096_102B902329DF7798">
&s;ame &s;imilitude, when he &s;peaks of tho&s;e who hear his &s;ayings, and <HI>do them not?</HI> Thus He tells us, that they which "do the will of his Father which is in heaven," &s;hall enter into the king|dom of heaven hereafter. Is the &s;ame ever &s;aid of tho&s;e who per&s;evere in their di&s;obedience to God's will? So we are told, that "to them who by patient continuing in well-doing, &s;eek for glory, honor, and immortality, God will render eternal life." Is the &s;ame promi&s;e made, in any part of the Go&s;pel, to tho&s;e that per&s;evere in do|ing evil? In &s;hort, nothing can be more appa|rent, than that the &s;cripture-promi&s;es of &s;alvation, are uniformly re&s;trained and limited to &s;uch as obey the go&s;pel; to &s;uch as having <HI>received the word with meekne&s;s</HI> "into good and hone&s;t hearts," bring forth the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s with patience.</P>
<P>BUT, that no doubt may be left upon the minds of any, with reference to &s;o important a point, I &s;hall now &s;how that all incorrigible &s;in|ners in general, are &s;o far from having any title to the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel, that they are excluded herefrom, and &s;entenced to future woe and mi&s;ery, by the mo&s;t expre&s;s and po&s;itive declarations of the Go&s;pel it&s;elf. Thus the apo&s;tle tells us, that "to them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, God will render indignation and wrath; tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul of man that doth evil:"
<PB N="91" REF="007488_0097_102B90250E639030">
That "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s:" And that "the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be reveal|ed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that <HI>obey not the Go&s;pel</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with an everla&s;ting de&s;truction."&mdash;Hear the expo&s;tulation and admonition of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle in another of his epi&s;tles. "Know ye not, &s;ays he, that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor whoremongers, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, &amp;c. &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God." Has not our Saviour plainly told us to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that the wicked "&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment?" Has he not told us, that in the judgment of the great day, he will &s;ay even to many who have <HI>eaten and drank in his pre&s;ence,</HI> "Depart from me, I know you not, all ye that work iniquity?" And not to multi|ply pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in &s;o plain a ca&s;e, only call to mind the &s;olemn words of our Saviour, in his la&s;t me&s;&s;age to the Churches, in the <HI>Revela|tion</HI> of <HI>St. John,</HI> towards the end&mdash;"I am Al|pha and Omega, the beginning and the end&mdash;He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things.&mdash;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and &s;orcerers, and idolaters, and all

<P>YOU now &s;ee what the plain, expre&s;s, repeated declarations of the Go&s;pel are; how they limit the &s;alvation revealed in it, to them that obey the truth; how they cut off from all hope of eternal life, and con&s;ign over to future puni&s;hment, all the irreclaimable workers of iniquity. God, who has the &s;ole right of ordaining and fixing the terms upon which his &s;inful creatures &s;hall be received into favour again; and enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of his pre&s;ence in the kingdom of Hea|ven: God him&s;elf, I &s;ay, has declared, that the hardened, irreclaimable tran&s;gre&s;&s;or &s;hall never <HI>enter into his re&s;t;</HI> and that only the pure in heart &s;hall &s;ee him, and be happy in the enjoy|ment of him. Nor are we to conceive of the&s;e terms as <HI>arbitrarily</HI> fixed, by him who&s;e will none can re&s;i&s;t, who&s;e hand none can &s;tay, and who is not accountable to any one for his pro|ceedings. No: We are to conceive of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> terms that are fit and rea&s;onable to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the all-wi&s;e, and all-good, as well as all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">

Sovereign of the world. It would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with his infinite wi&s;dom, and perfect goodne&s;s and holine&s;s, to have accepted &s;inners to his favour, and promi&s;ed eternal life to them, but upon condition of their returning to Him, and keeping his commandments.</P>
<P>AND if we duly attend to the thing, we &s;hall &s;ee that &s;uch a temper and practice as the Go&s;pel requires of us, is nece&s;&s;ary not only as a <HI>condition,</HI> but as a <HI>qualification</HI> for future happine&s;s. Altho' this world is much better adapted to the depraved ta&s;te and temper of wicked men, than the king|dom of heaven; yet they cannot be happy even here. God has con&s;tituted us in &s;uch a manner; He has given us &s;uch a nature, that vice is an irreconcileable enemy to our happine&s;s; and vir|tue alone, friendly to it. "The way of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors is hard:" and "the wicked are like the troubled &s;ea which cannot re&s;t." Thus it is in this pre&s;ent &s;tate; and thus it mu&s;t needs be, in any other. A foundation mu&s;t be laid for happine&s;s, in the purity and moral rectitude of our minds. Were a wicked man to be this day tran|&s;lated to heaven, with all his lu&s;ts and unholy pa&s;&s;ions about him, there is nothing there which would corre&s;pond to his ta&s;te and reli&s;h, &s;o as to make him truly ble&s;&s;ed in the enjoyment. Could the &s;ociety of ju&s;t men made perfect? could the fellow&s;hip of holy angels, be delightful to an im|pure, bruti&s;h creature? What fellow&s;hip hath light with darkne&s;s?

Chri&s;t with Belial, or the &s;ons of Belial? What happine&s;s can one who is every way unlike to God, and who&s;e carnal mind is enmity again&s;t him, have in being in his glorious pre&s;ence? or how is &s;uch a one capable of enjoying him? Wicked men, in&s;tead of expecting any felicity from the pre&s;ence and vi&s;ion of God, might adopt the language of the apo&s;tate angels, "Farthe&s;t from him is be&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>IF then we are not even in a capacity for enjoying the happine&s;s which the Go&s;pel reveals, in the kingdom and pre&s;ence of God, while we retain our lu&s;ts and vices, how vain and ab&s;urd is it to imagine we can be intitled to it? We mu&s;t obey the go&s;pel, and have our tempers conformed to the holy maxims and precepts of Chri&s;tianity, before we are capable &s;ubjects of that felicity which is brought to light thereby.

they would &s;oon turn their new heaven into a real hell; and the place of their expected bli&s;s, would prove only the place of their torment. For wherever the wicked are; in whatever region, in whatever world, they cannot but be mi&s;erable in a greater or le&s;s degree. So the God of nature, &s;o the all-wi&s;e governor of the world, has ordain|ed; and <HI>His coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>UPON laying together the &s;everal things that have been &s;aid above, I think it plainly appears, that obedience to the go&s;pel is not only a thing that is <HI>fitting, rea&s;onable,</HI> and <HI>very proper,</HI> for tho&s;e that <HI>believe;</HI> (as &s;ome would repre&s;ent it) but that it is ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> in order to our obtaining eternal life; nece&s;&s;ary, both as the condition upon which God offers &s;al|vation to us, and as the qualification for future glory and happine&s;s. This is &s;o clearly, &s;o often, &s;o emphatically declared in the holy &s;criptures, that one need not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that who&s;oever is not a <HI>doer of the word,</HI> as well as a <HI>hearer,</HI> has no more ground to expect &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, than the fallen <HI>angels;</HI> altho' he took not upon him <HI>their</HI> nature, but the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham.</HI> It is to impre&s;s this important truth upon our minds the more effectually, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has, in &s;ome of his di&s;cour&s;es, introduced wicked <HI>believers,</HI> as making their &s;everal excu&s;es, and pleas for mercy in the day of judgment; all which he rejects as in|&s;ufficient and vain. In the&s;e repre&s;entations of the
<PB N="96" REF="007488_0102_102B902E2AF67D48">
la&s;t day, we &s;ee the formali&s;ts in religion, I mean the&s;e <HI>who hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;tanding before their righteous Judge; we hear them &s;aying, "We have eaten and drank in thy pre&s;ence; and in thy name ca&s;t out devils; and thou ha&s;t taught in our &s;treets;" and pleading, upon this foundation, for admittance into the kingdom of heaven. And at the &s;ame time we hear this ju&s;t, and merciful Saviour of men, an|&s;wering, "Depart from me, ye that work iniqui|ty!" So that this matter is repre&s;ented to us in the &s;tronge&s;t light po&s;&s;ible. And can any, after this, hope for mercy in the day of Judgment, tho' they indulge them&s;elves at pre&s;ent in impiety and vice? They cannot, without making Chri&s;t a liar, and his Go&s;pel a fable:&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEREFORE to conclude: As we de&s;ire to have a part in the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t; as we have any dread of falling under the condemnation of the wicked; as we have any regard to the words of our Redeemer, to the will of our ma|ker, to the honor of our religion, to the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls; let us hearken to the Admonition in the text, "Be ye doers of the word; and not hearers only, deceiving your own&s;elves." Let us apply our&s;elves in earne&s;t to the regulating of our tempers and manners; in which attempt we cannot but prove &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;ince it is God that worketh in us and with us. It is not more &s;ure that there is an heaven, than it is, that they who
<PB N="97" REF="007488_0103_102B9030B6E35C70">
obey not the go&s;pel, &s;hall never enter into it. It is not more certain that there is an hell, than that all the impenitent workers of iniquity &s;hall &s;uffer the pains of it. And among&s;t all the Wicked, none will be &s;ubjected to &s;orer puni&s;hment, than the hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors of religion, who pretend to know God, but in works deny him; who call Chri&s;t their Lord and ma&s;ter, but di&s;obey his commandments. To &s;uch, the ingrafted word is &s;o far from being, in the event, the power of God unto &s;alvation; that it is in &s;ome &s;ort, <HI>the mini&s;tration of death,</HI> as the apo&s;tle terms <HI>the Law;</HI> binding them over to a heavier, and more inevitable puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>DO you really de&s;ire the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls? Would you be indeed heirs of that glorious inheritance which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for &s;in|ners? Surely you do. Why then, my brethren, be at the pains to comply with tho&s;e terms on which it is offered to you. Give up your pride and coveteou&s;ne&s;s; give up your malice and envy, give up all your worldly lu&s;ts. "If your right hand offend you, cut it off; if your right eye of|fend you, pluck it out. For it is better to enter into life thus, than having two hands and two eyes to be ca&s;t into hell fire, where the worm dieth not. The Go&s;pel it&s;elf cannot give life to you, unle&s;s it is ingrafted into your hearts; &s;o that your tempers and manners are formed to a re&s;emblance of the divine author of it. Let your

faith purify your hearts, and work by love. Do your duty to God, love and obey your Redeemer; do unto all men as you would that they &s;hould do unto you; be &s;ober and temperate in all things, as tho&s;e that &s;trive for the ma&s;tery: And "hope unto the end for the grace that &s;hall be brought unto you, at the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as obedient children, not fa&s;hioning your&s;elves ac|cording to your former lu&s;ts."&mdash;I cannot clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e better than with the words imme|diately following my text&mdash;"If any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a gla&s;s: For he be|holdeth him&s;elf, and goeth his way, and &s;traitway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But who &s;o looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hear|er, but a doer of the work, this man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed."</P>

<P>MANKIND are liable to many errors and de|lu&s;ions, even tho' they take pains to be rightly informed. They are &s;till more liable to err, in tho&s;e ca&s;es where they are not cautious and wary, but almo&s;t indifferent whether they are deceived or not. But mo&s;t of all are they in danger of falling into mi&s;takes, when they have a &s;ecret prejudice again&s;t the truth; and are more di&s;po&s;ed to em|brace the wrong &s;ide of a que&s;tion than the right, by rea&s;on of &s;ome wrong bya&s;s upon their minds. For men are not only liable to be impo&s;ed upon and deceived by others; but in &s;ome ca&s;es, they impo&s;e upon, and <HI>deceive their own&s;elves.</HI> And hence it is that we are as frequently cautioned again&s;t &s;elf-deception in &s;cripture, as we are ad|moni&s;hed to take heed that we are not deceived by others. This caution is never more nece&s;&s;ary, than when we are inquiring into the terms of ac|ceptance and &s;alvation, propo&s;ed to us in the Go&s;pel; whether we con&s;ider the importance of forming a right judgment in this matter, or the natural propen&s;ity and inclination which there is in us, to make tho&s;e terms as ea&s;y and agreable to our&s;elves as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

ALL men would be happy hereafter; but with as little difficulty to them&s;elves as may be; as little &s;elf-denial; as little labour; as little care to work out their &s;alvation. This I doubt not, is the true &s;ource of many licentious, li|bertine doctrines, tending to reconcile a vicious immoral life, with the hopes of God's favour, and future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; altho' nothing can be more repugnant to &s;ober rea&s;on, and the whole current of the Chri&s;tian revelation Vicious men are loth to give up their beloved lu&s;ts, and to live that pious and holy life which the go&s;pel injoins upon us. And therefore they per&s;wade them&s;elves to believe that there is no &s;uch ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it as &s;ome pretend; and endeavour to evade the force of all tho&s;e arguments which are brought to evince it. However wicked they are, they are not willing to think them&s;elves &s;uch per&s;ons as the Go&s;pel excludes from that life and immortality, which are brought to light thereby. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the &s;criptures, however plain|ly and peremptorily they &s;peak as to this point, are often tortur'd and wre&s;ted; and made, whe|ther they will or no, to favour men's lu&s;ts, and ill-grounded hopes. The mere &s;ound of a word or phra&s;e, &s;hall often carry more conviction in it, in the apprehen&s;ion of men who would fain be happy without being good, than in the whole cur|rent of revelation: And drowning men, we know, will catch at &s;traws. For example; how
<PB N="102" REF="007488_0108_102B903AB6F8B930">
greedily do many per&s;ons of licentious practices lay hold on &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, that we are "&s;aved by grace;" that we are "ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law;" that we mu&s;t be "found in Chri&s;t not having our own righteou&s;ne&s;s;" and the like? Many vicious per|&s;ons think they find great ground of peace, con|&s;olation and hope, in &s;uch-like expre&s;&s;ions; and conclude from them, that the go&s;pel-covenant of grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, is of &s;uch a nature, as not to require repentance and new obedience as the indi&s;pen&s;able condition of &s;alvation; but &s;uch as will admit of the &s;alvation of habitual &s;inners, pro|vided they believe in Chri&s;t, and rely wholly up|on his righteou&s;ne&s;s. This, in general, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the error which <HI>St. James</HI> aims at refuting more particularly in the &s;econd chapter of his epi&s;tle: An error which very early appeared in the church; and in the &s;upport of which, <HI>St. Paul'</HI>s doctrine had been alledged. And if there is any &s;uch thing as a fundamental error of the judg|ment, this is doubtle&s;s one. It is a mi&s;take con|cerning the <HI>general nature</HI> of that covenant of grace and mercy, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in Chri&s;t, for the re&s;toration and &s;alvation of &s;inners. It is moreover an error of &s;uch a &s;ort, as naturally tends to confirm men in their wicked cour&s;es; &s;ince, according to this notion, it is needle&s;s for them to for&s;ake tho&s;e cour&s;es; and to obey the commandments of Chri&s;t, in order to their future
<PB N="103" REF="007488_0109_102B903C46E5D2C8">
happine&s;s. So that per&s;ons who are fallen into this delu&s;ion may &s;in, as it were, upon principle; at lea&s;t they may &s;in, without hazarding their &s;alvation, according to their own notion of the terms on which it is offered.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed particularly to lay open the vanity and ab&s;urdity of this notion, I would premi&s;e one thing in order to prevent mi&s;-con|&s;truction; e&s;pecially to guard again&s;t the charge of cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s and uncharity. And that is, that how much &s;oever any man may be mi&s;taken in opinion concerning the terms of &s;alvation; yet if he is practically in the right, there is no doubt but he will be accepted of God, who con&s;iders our frame, and knows our weakne&s;s. Po&s;&s;ibly many per&s;ons, according to who&s;e principles obedience to the Go&s;pel is not nece&s;&s;ary, may yet be as truly <HI>doers</HI> of the word, as tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en|timents concerning this matter, are more confor|mable to rea&s;on and &s;cripture. And it is cer|tain that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hall not be excluded from &s;alvation, merely on account of their erroneous opinion It is infinitely di&s;honourable to the all good and perfect Governor of the world, to imagine that he has &s;u&s;pended the eternal &s;alva|tion of men upon any niceties of &s;peculation: Or that any one who hone&s;tly aims at finding the truth, and at doing the will of his Maker, &s;hall be finally di&s;carded becau&s;e he fell into &s;ome erro|neous opinions. He who&s;e heart is right with
<PB N="104" REF="007488_0110_102B903E242D5E28">
God; he who &s;eeks his will in his word, with an unbia&s;&s;ed mind; and he who con&s;cientiou&s;ly obeys the go&s;pel, can be guilty of no error for which an infinitely good and merciful Being will condemn him.</P>
<P>I ADD, that altho' &s;uch a &s;incere inquirer after the truth, &s;hould embrace opinions which give countenance to vice and libertini&s;m, in a natural and fair con&s;truction; yea, altho' the &s;ame prin|ciples, &s;hould, by being acted upon, prove the de&s;truction of other per&s;ons; yet &s;urely he, who&s;e practice is not influenced by them; but is conformable to the &s;tricter maxims of piety and virtue laid down in the Go&s;pel, will reap the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the end. And altho' mo&s;t men are not &s;o good as their principles oblige them to be; yet it is certain that &s;ome men are better: Which I take to be the ca&s;e of many, who place the whole of religion in faith, and de|pendance upon the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: For many &s;uch, doubtle&s;s live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly and godly in the world.</P>
<P>INDEED if per&s;ons fall into &s;uch errors as are, in their own nature, incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian piety and virtue; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> errors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mu&s;t needs be fa|tal; becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured that no righteous per&s;on &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the kingdom of God.

&s;uch errors mu&s;t be fatal in their <HI>con&s;equence;</HI> tho' not nece&s;&s;arily &s;o, con&s;idered in them&s;elves. How incon&s;iderable any error may be in it&s;elf; if the effect of it is either the making a man vicious, or keeping him &s;o, to him it is and mu&s;t be fatal in the event: Tho' to others it may not prove &s;o; becau&s;e it may not have the &s;ame effect upon them. Nor, indeed, is there any &s;peculative er|ror, however great, which can exclude a good and upright man, who obeys the laws of Chri&s;|tianity, from the kingdom of heaven: Tho' it may probably prove, in &s;ome degree, prejudicial to his virtue; retard him in his progre&s;s towards Chri&s;tian perfection; and &s;o prevent his obtaining &s;o bright a crown of glory, at the end of his race, as he might otherwi&s;e have done. Accord|ingly we read of &s;ome that build <HI>wood, hay, &s;tub|ble,</HI> i. e. fal&s;e, ab&s;urd, and hurtful doctrines, up|on the ba&s;is of Chri&s;tianity, who yet &s;hall be &s;aved at la&s;t, tho' "&s;o as by fire."</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations &s;hould, on the one hand, keep us from being cen&s;orious towards our fellow Chri&s;tians; and from dealing out our <HI>anathema's</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e that are in error. On the other hand, they &s;hould make us &s;incerely inqui&s;itive after the truth our&s;elves, and zealous in the de|fence of it. It is, by no means, an indifferent thing, whether people have ju&s;t conceptions of Chri&s;tianity or not; tho' all parties have perhaps laid too much &s;tre&s;s upon their own peculiar &s;en|timents;
<PB N="106" REF="007488_0112_102B90423B42E218">
and been wanting in candor and for|bearance towards others. The more ju&s;tly people conceive of the doctrines of the Go&s;pel, the more likely they are, humanly &s;peaking, to live as be|comes their profe&s;&s;ion. Mi&s;taken notions of re|ligion, e&s;picially &s;uch as evidently di&s;annul the obligations to obedience, rendering the command|ments of God of none effect, &s;hould certainly be oppo&s;ed and refuted; altho' they &s;hould not be ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with a good life, and evan|gelical righteou&s;ne&s;s. If we ought to "contend earne&s;tly for the <HI>faith</HI> once delivered to the &s;aints;" we ought certainly to contend with as much earne&s;tne&s;s at lea&s;t for that practical piety and virtue, without which no one can be a &s;aint; and which is, in fact, the end of all faith.</P>
<P>IT is not very &s;trange if tho&s;e, who&s;e principles allow them to live wickedly, &s;hould <HI>allow them|&s;elves</HI> in it: E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider how many there are, who allow them&s;elves to do &s;o, contrary to their principles.&mdash;There are great numbers of per&s;ons in the Chri&s;tian world who, altho' they acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience to the go&s;pel, yet practically deny it, led away by their own lu&s;ts and enticed. What then can be naturally expected of tho&s;e, who imagine they have a di&s;pen&s;ation for &s;inning? and that good works are of little or no account in the chri&s;tian religion! It is rather to be wonder'd at, that any of the&s;e deluded per&s;ons &s;hould be good, (as it is
<PB N="107" REF="007488_0113_102B9043C9C71510">
to be hoped they are) than that &s;o many of them &s;hould be wicked, as there is rea&s;on to fear. For it is very unu&s;ual for men to be better than their own principles oblige them to be: tho' it is very common for them to be much wor&s;e than they can be, in con&s;i&s;tancy with them.</P>
<P>THE delu&s;ions to which I had a particular re|ference above, may all be reduced to one grand, capital error; which is this, That the merits of Chri&s;t's obedience and &s;ufferings, may be &s;o ap|plied or imputed to &s;inners, as to be available to their ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, altho' they are de&s;titute of all per&s;onal inherent goodne&s;s. This grand mi&s;take is variou&s;ly modified; it puts on different forms and appearances; and &s;cripture-terms and phra&s;es are brought to &s;upport it. When it is cloathed in &s;cripture language, it is expre&s;&s;ed thus; that we are <HI>&s;aved by grace;</HI> that we mu&s;t be <HI>found in Chri&s;t not having on our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law;</HI> that we are <HI>ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e are the phra&s;es which, I &s;uppo&s;e, have been the mo&s;t commonly abu&s;ed and perverted to &s;erve &s;o bad a purpo&s;e, as that of mak|ing men believe they may be in a &s;tate of favour with God, while they live in di&s;obedience to his commandments. They all amount to much the &s;ame thing, both in their natural and true &s;en&s;e as they are u&s;ed by the &s;acred writers, and in the opinion of tho&s;e who wre&s;t and pervert
<PB N="108" REF="007488_0114_102B90464FDDF360">
them. However I &s;hall con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly; and endeavour to re&s;cue them from the fal&s;e, ab|&s;urd glo&s;&s;es which have been put upon them, greatly to the prejudice of pure and undefiled re|ligion. And I hope it will &s;ufficiently appear, that tho&s;e who u&s;e the&s;e phra&s;es in order to di&s;|parage good works, and evangelical obedience; or in order to &s;how that we may be ju&s;tified and &s;aved without being <HI>doers of the word, deceive their own&s;elves,</HI> and delude tho&s;e who believe them. For they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be tho't to fa|vour &s;o licentious an opinion, 'til they are mi&s;un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>IT is only the fir&s;t of them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That we are <HI>&s;aved by grace,</HI> that will be con&s;idered in this di&s;|cour&s;e. Now that we are really &s;aved by grace, no one who believes the &s;criptures will deny; this being not only a doctrine of &s;cripture, but ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the the very words of &s;cripture. But tho&s;e who imagine that, becau&s;e we are &s;aved by grace, obedience to the go&s;pel is not nece&s;&s;ary, as the condition on our part, in order to &s;alvation, draw a conclu&s;ion which is very unnatural. If the&s;e things are reconcileable one with the other; if it <HI>may</HI> be true that we are &s;aved by grace, and yet true that we cannot be &s;aved without obedi|ence: then certainly the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of obedience, does not at all militate again&s;t the doctrine of our &s;alvation by grace. For if there be no real repugnancy betwixt the&s;e principles,
<PB N="109" REF="007488_0115_102B9047D7278550">
they may be both equally true; nor can the fal&s;hood of one be inferred from the truth of the other.</P>
<P>MY bu&s;ine&s;s here therefore, is, to &s;how that there is no incon&s;i&s;tency betwixt the&s;e doctrines; that tho' we are &s;aved by grace, yet we are &s;aved in the way of obedience, and con&s;equently, that it is a perver&s;ion and abu&s;e of the &s;cripture doc|trine of grace, to infer from it, that obedience to Chri&s;t's Commandments, is not the go&s;pel con|dition of our acceptance with God, and obtaining eternal life by him.</P>
<P>NOW, that to be &s;aved by grace, in the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, does not imply that we are &s;aved without, or independently of, obedience and per|&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, is very evident in general from hence, That <HI>that</HI> grace of God which has appeared unto us, teaches us, not that we may hope for &s;alvation while we continue in &s;in; but that <HI>denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world; looking,</HI> in con&s;equence of our living thus, <HI>for the ble&s;&s;ed hope.</HI> If even the grace of God which is revealed to us, teaches us that we are to turn from our &s;ins to God; it mu&s;t be an ab&s;urd inference, that we need not turn from &s;in to God, becau&s;e this grace is revealed to us, and we are &s;aved thereby.

and &s;erve him, therefore we need not do &s;o; but may obtain his favour without! St. <HI>Paul</HI> has ex|pre&s;ly caution'd us again&s;t &s;uch an abu&s;e of the doctrine of God's grace.

THIS is, I think, &s;ufficient to &s;how in <HI>general,</HI> that all tho&s;e mi&s;under&s;tand the &s;cripture doctrine of our &s;alvation by grace, who infer from it, that our &s;alvation is not &s;u&s;pended upon our obedience to God's commandments. But let us be a little more <HI>particular</HI> in con&s;idering the &s;everal &s;igni|fications of the term <HI>grace,</HI> in the new te&s;tament; that &s;o we may &s;ee whether either of them mili|tates again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of obedience and good works.</P>
<P>AND let us begin with the primary and mo&s;t general notion hereof; which is <HI>favour;</HI> or &s;ome act of <HI>goodne&s;s, genero&s;ity</HI> or <HI>bounty,</HI> as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from tho&s;e acts which come within the known laws of common equity and ju&s;tice. In conformity to this fir&s;t and mo&s;t general &s;en&s;e of the term, when it is &s;aid that we are &s;aved by grace, the meaning is, that we do not merit &s;al|vation; that we cannot demand it upon the foot|ing of natural ju&s;tice; but it flows from another fountain, even from the abounding goodne&s;s and mercy of God. It proceeds wholly from his un|de&s;erved favour; and is to be acknowledged as <HI>his gift,</HI> not claimed as <HI>our due.</HI> And that our &s;alvation is of grace in this &s;en&s;e, I as firmly be|lieve, and am as ready to a&s;&s;ert, if not &s;o able to prove, as any other per&s;on whatever. Our &s;al|vation took its ri&s;e in the mere bounty and good|ne&s;s of God. And the &s;ame over-flowing good|ne&s;s, in which it had it's origin, is con&s;picious in
<PB N="112" REF="007488_0118_102B904EB79B0BE0">
every part of it, 'til it is, or rather &s;hall be, com|pleated and perfected in the regions of immortal bli&s;s. But does it follow from hence, that this &s;alvation does not accrue to us in the way of obedience to Chri&s;t's commandments? May it not be true, that God requires this obedience of us, as what is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation; and yet be true, at the &s;ame time, that He manife&s;ts his favour, and great goodne&s;s to us herein? Certainly our obedience, however nece&s;&s;ary it may be, is not &s;o valuable and meri|torious, as to be an adequate con&s;ideration for the &s;alvation and eternal happine&s;s of our &s;ouls: So far from this, that we ought to look upon our|&s;elves as <HI>unprofitable &s;ervants,</HI> even tho' we had done all tho&s;e things that are required of us. How then could it ever enter into the heart of man to imagine, that if obedience to the go&s;pel is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation, then it could not be true that we are &s;aved by grace; as if &s;uch obedience excluded grace; and left no room for the exerci&s;e of it? Tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t &s;et a very undue and di&s;proportionate value upon our im|perfect obedience, who imagine it leaves no place for the manife&s;tation of divine grace or favour in our &s;alvation; and that whatever God is plea&s;ed to confer upon us in con&s;equence hereof, is only the paying of a debt, or rendering the labourer the reward, to which he has intitled him&s;elf, on the footing of common equity.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="007488_0119_102B905098ECB108">
THE rea&s;oning of &s;ome per&s;ons upon this point are very &s;trange and unaccountable; and, I think quite incon&s;i&s;tent. For one while they tell us, that our obedience, and be&s;t good works, are only as <HI>filthy rags;</HI> &s;o very mean and contemptible, that they cannot be truly acceptable to God, or fit to be rewarded by him: Yea, that they are attended with &s;o much &s;in and imperfection, that they mu&s;t be odious to him; and rather need a pardon, than entitle us to a reward. But, in the next, if not the &s;ame breath, we are told, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e <HI>filthy</HI> and <HI>abominable</HI> good works, if &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary and conducive to our &s;alvation, would &s;ubvert the doctrine of our being &s;aved by grace: Which is to &s;ay in other words, that imperfect and &s;inful as they are, they are yet &s;o valuable, &s;o ex|cellent, &s;o meritorious, that they leave no room for God to exerci&s;e grace in our &s;alvation! But if our works of righteou&s;ne&s;s are all &s;o imperfect, not to &s;ay &s;o <HI>filthy,</HI> as they are &s;ometimes repre|&s;ented to be, one would think there was no dan|ger of excluding divine grace, by &s;aying that obedience to the Go&s;pel is made the condition of our &s;alvation. Tho' obedience is required in or|der to our &s;alvation, it cannot be tho't meritorious of it. The truth lies betwixt the two extremes mentioned above. Our obedience and good works are really acceptable to God in &s;ome degree; otherwi&s;e he would not have required us to per|form them, and promi&s;ed to reward them; as he
<PB N="114" REF="007488_0120_102B905221DF2480">
has mo&s;t certainly done. But yet they are not &s;o valuable in their own nature, as to merit eternal life for tho&s;e who perform them. God is infinite|ly gracious, in accepting this imperfect obedience thro' Chri&s;t, and in be&s;towing eternal life upon the &s;ubjects of it. This is therefore a reward, not of merit on our &s;ide, but of grace on God's part. How unju&s;tly then, are tho&s;e who hold the nece&s;|&s;ity of per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s; and believe that God will graciou&s;ly reward our obedience, thro' Chri&s;t, charged with maintaining the doctrine of merit, in oppo&s;ition to grace? This is but too common a &s;lander, made u&s;e of by captious un|charitable men, to bring a reproach upon tho&s;e whom they di&s;like.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, that the mo&s;t perfect man does not work out a righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;trictly legal. Salvation therefore cannot be ob|tained, but upon the footing of grace or favour. Yea, I may add, that altho' our obedience were perfect, it would &s;till be favour and bounty in God, to be&s;tow eternal life upon us in con&s;equence of it. We might indeed, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, claim an exemption from puni&s;hment and mi&s;ery, according to the immutable laws of right and equity. But to a&s;&s;ert that the mo&s;t perfect righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and obedience of a creature, would, in it's own nature, on account of it's inherent worth, and independently of any promi&s;e of God, intitle that creature to endle&s;s happine&s;s, is to a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="115" REF="007488_0121_102B905467A8E0B8">
more than any man can prove. It would evident|ly be grace in God to confer endle&s;s immea&s;urable bli&s;s, upon a creature, who had in no in&s;tance violated his laws. The reward would be more, infinitely more, than adequate to the &s;ervice per|formed. Who can pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the holie&s;t angel in heaven, has by his obedience, &s;trictly &s;peaking, merited everla&s;ting happine&s;s? or, that it is not grace in God, to confer this up|on any creature whatever? If God makes a crea|ture happy during his obedience, it is the utmo&s;t that ju&s;tice requires. Such a creature might, without receiving any wrong or injury, be de|prived of his exi&s;tence and happine&s;s together, after per&s;evering in his obedience for any given time. The Author of his being, is not that I know of, ab&s;olutely obliged to pre&s;erve him for|ever, becau&s;e the creature has not &s;werved from his duty. And if God is not bound in ju&s;tice to make &s;uch a creature eternally happy, it mu&s;t be grace in him to do it; for betwixt ju&s;tice and grace, there is in this ca&s;e no medium. Certain|ly then, it is grace in God to be&s;tow endle&s;s happine&s;s upon tho&s;e who have violated his laws, however penitent and reformed they are. And this, I hope, is &s;ufficient to &s;how, that altho' we cannot be &s;aved, without obedience to the Go&s;|pel; and altho' this is, properly &s;peaking, the condition upon which pardon and eternal life are offered to us; yet it may be &s;till equally true, that
<PB N="116" REF="007488_0122_102B9056CEC9DBB0">
we are &s;aved by grace, as that &s;ignifies favour and unmerited goodne&s;s in the Creator and Lord of all.</P>
<P>It will come to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t, if by grace we under&s;tand more particularly the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. The term is often u&s;ed thus in &s;crip|ture; and indeed this is the mo&s;t common &s;en&s;e of it. And the Go&s;pel is called grace, by a u|&s;ual figure, in re&s;pect of the &s;ubject of it; be|cau&s;e it is a declaration and manife&s;tation of God's grace or favour towards &s;inners. Hence we read of <HI>the Go&s;pel of the grace of God.</HI> And this di&s;|pen&s;ation of mercy, is &s;ometimes &s;tyled grace more e&s;pecially in contradi&s;tinction from the <HI>Mo|&s;aic,</HI> or <HI>Legal</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation. So it is &s;aid, that "the <HI>Law</HI> was given by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> but <HI>Grace,</HI>&mdash;came by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And in general, where-ever law and grace are oppo&s;ed to each other in the new te&s;tament, grace means the Go&s;pel, the good news of pardon and eternal life, brought from heaven to earth by the Son of God, and preached to the world by his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>NOW if we under&s;tand the term in this appro|priate &s;en&s;e, when we are &s;aid to be &s;aved by grace, the meaning will be, that we are &s;aved by the Go&s;pel, or in the way which the Go&s;pel reveals to us; which is a declaration of God's favour and mercy to &s;inful creatures; a declaration of his gracious purpo&s;e to forgive and &s;ave tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, upon certain terms therein marked out;
<PB N="117" REF="007488_0123_102B9058AF5F7CB8">
and which does not in&s;i&s;t upon perfect Obedience, as the Law of MOSES &s;eems, according to the letter of it, to have done.

<P>IT may be here a&s;ked again, how our be|ing &s;aved by grace, in this &s;en&s;e, militates again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of repentance from dead works, and &s;incerely obeying that Go&s;pel, by which we are to be &s;aved? What tho' we are not, neither can be, &s;aved upon the footing of mere law, whether the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or the law of nature? What tho' we are &s;aved by, or in the way of, a new and merciful covenant e&s;tabli&s;hed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us? a covenant of Grace, wherein provi&s;ion is made for the re&s;toration of &s;inners to the divine favour? Will it follow from hence, that we are &s;aved without any kind or degree of obedience? It is not incon&s;i&s;tent even with a covenant of grace, that it &s;hould propo&s;e to us certain terms and conditions for our acceptance, in order to our obtaining the ble&s;&s;ings thereof. And tho' we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the terms on which the go&s;pel offers &s;alvation to us, are tho&s;e of faith and new obedience, would this make it cea&s;e to
<PB N="118" REF="007488_0124_102B905A93CCB5D8">
be a covenant of grace? Surely, the covenant may be very gracious, tho' it promi&s;es pardon and eternal life, only to penitent, obedient be|lievers.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, to be &s;aved by grace, meaning here|by the go&s;pel of God's grace, is to be &s;aved in that way, in that method, which the go&s;pel opens, provides for us, and pre&s;cribes to us. To know particularly what that way is, we mu&s;t look into the go&s;pel it&s;elf: And if we do &s;o, we &s;hall find that it is &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that obedience to the pre|cepts of it is nece&s;&s;ary; that this is the very thing which it makes nece&s;&s;ary; the great, or rather the only, condition upon which it offers &s;alvation to us. For in this di&s;pen&s;ation of the grace of God, it is, that we are a&s;&s;ured, that Chri&s;t is be|come the author of eternal &s;alvation to all them that obey him; and that tho&s;e who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall fall under condemnation hereafter. Since, therefore, to be &s;aved by grace, is to be &s;aved in the way which the go&s;pel reveals to us; and &s;ince the go&s;pel it&s;elf expre&s;sly requires repentance and &s;incere obedience in order to our &s;alvation; it is a very ab&s;urd inference, that becau&s;e we are &s;aved in this method of grace, therefore we are not &s;aved in the way of obedience; which is indeed the on|ly way that the go&s;pel knows of: Unle&s;s by be|ing &s;aved in the way of obedience, you mean
<PB N="119" REF="007488_0125_102B905C1D3B0458">
obedience that is perfect and &s;trictly legal; for if that is what is intended hereby, it is certain that no one is &s;aved in that way, no one having per|formed &s;uch obedience. But it will not follow, that becau&s;e perfect obedience is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation, therefore no obedience at all is nece&s;&s;ary to that end: Nor are we charge|able with turning the go&s;pel of God's grace into a covenant of works, in repre&s;enting all the ble&s;&s;ings of it as confined to tho&s;e who, "having believed in God, are careful to maintain good works."</P>
<P>TO proceed, the term grace is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to expre&s;s a heavenly, divine principle in the hearts of tho&s;e who are born again. I am not certain, indeed, that the &s;cripture ever u&s;es the term in this &s;en&s;e; tho' this being now common with theological and practical writers, we will take the propriety of it for granted. And if we are &s;aved by grace in this &s;en&s;e, it is the very thing which I would prove, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we are &s;aved by holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and evangelical obedience; not without it. For what do we mean by this divine principle, this grace in the hearts of the re|generate, but a principle of goodne&s;s, or holine&s;s? a principle, which makes us re&s;emble God, and prompts us to live in obedience to his command|ments? To be &s;aved by grace, under&s;tanding thereby a principle of real &s;anctity in the heart, and &s;uch a one as is always productive of good
<PB N="120" REF="007488_0126_102B905EC6210BC8">
fruits in the life, is &s;o far from being repugnant to the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of evangelical obedience, that it is the very &s;ame doctrine, only expre&s;&s;ed in different words. For when it is &s;aid, that o|beying the go&s;pel is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation, or that we are &s;aved by &s;uch obedience; nothing more is intended, than that it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a gracious principle as was &s;poken of above; a principle of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which manife&s;ts it&s;elf in a good conver&s;a|tion; and that who&s;oever is endowed therewith, has the promi&s;e of eternal life. So that they who a&s;&s;ert we are &s;aved by grace, in this &s;en&s;e of the term, are &s;o far from contradicting tho&s;e who maintain the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience, and the effi|cacy of it, that they a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame thing them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT will make no material difference, as to the point now before us, if by grace we under&s;tand, not a principle of goodne&s;s and holine&s;s in the heart, but tho&s;e influences and operations of the &s;pirit of God upon the heart, by which that good principle is produced therein. This, if I mi&s;take not, is what people often mean by the term grace. Let us therefore under&s;tand it thus, for the pre|&s;ent; and con&s;ider whether our being &s;aved by grace, militates again&s;t the other &s;uppo&s;ition, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we are &s;aved in the way of obedience to Chri&s;t's commandments. And now, under&s;tand|ing the term thus, when it is &s;aid we are &s;aved by
<PB N="121" REF="007488_0127_102B9060A36C0228">
grace, the meaning mu&s;t be, That God &s;aves us by begetting or producing in us, a principle of holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that we could not be &s;aved, did He not thus give his holy &s;pirit to renew and &s;anctify us: Or this may be expre&s;&s;ed more in the phra&s;e of &s;cripture, thus, That God &s;aves us by "working in us both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure": Or thus, that He "&s;aves us by the wa&s;hing of regenera|tion, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t:" Or, "thro' &s;anctification of the &s;pirit unto o|bedience." Very well: it is readily acknowled|ged, that it is by the operations of the &s;pirit of God upon our hearts, that we attain to true holi|ne&s;s; and that we cannot be &s;aved without his ble&s;&s;ed influences, in turning us from &s;in to righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. But what does this make again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ity of obedience? The being &s;aved by grace in this &s;en&s;e, pre-&s;uppo&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s, of per&s;onal purity, and &s;anctity of heart and manners. For the grace of God, or the gracious influences of his Spirit, in turning us from unrighteou&s;ne&s;s to obedience, would not be nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation, where not obedience it&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to that end. The nece&s;&s;i|ty of the former, ari&s;es only from the nece&s;&s;ity of the latter. For if you &s;uppo&s;e that righteou&s;ne&s;s and obedience, are not nece&s;&s;ary to the end men|tioned, and that we may be &s;aved without them; certainly that grace of God, by which we are
<PB N="122" REF="007488_0128_102B90622A1C7CB0">
made righteous, is unnece&s;&s;ary al&s;o. The grace of God, meaning thereby the gracious influences of his &s;pirit, contributes to our &s;alvation, only as it produces in us that holine&s;s which is the con|dition of our being &s;aved, and by which we are made meet for the kingdom of Heaven. So that to &s;ay, we are &s;aved by grace, in this &s;en&s;e of the term, is in effect to &s;ay, that we are &s;aved by that divine and heavenly principle which is wrought in us by the good Spirit of God, co-operating with the go&s;pel of his Son; and that we could not be &s;aved, unle&s;s we were thus <HI>crea|ted anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works.</HI> And this, &s;urely, is very con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that we are &s;aved in the way of obedience to the Go&s;pel, or by our being <HI>doers of the word.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE mentioned are the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;en&s;es of the term grace: Nor can I readily think of any other or different meaning, that can be affixed thereto, when we are &s;aid to be &s;aved thereby. The &s;en&s;e of the propo&s;ition, mu&s;t be either (1) in general, that we are &s;aved by the favour and bounty of God to us, in oppo&s;ition to the doc|trine of merit; or (2) that we are &s;aved by the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> or (3) that we are &s;aved by being truly holy; by what &s;ome call a principle of Grace in the heart; or (<HI>la&s;tly</HI>) by God's produ|cing &s;uch a principle in us, by the gracious influ|ences of his Spirit; which comes to the &s;ame
<PB N="123" REF="007488_0129_102B9063B35DCBA8">
thing, with re&s;pect to the point now in hand. And the doctrine of our being &s;aved by grace, in any, or in all of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, does not militate in the lea&s;t degree again&s;t the doctrine of our being &s;aved by obedience to the Go&s;pel; and of our ob|taining, in this way an intere&s;t in God's peculiar love here, together with an inheritance hereafter in the kingdom of heaven. The nece&s;&s;ity of o|bedience is rather e&s;tabli&s;hed, than overthrown and refuted, by the &s;cripture doctrine of our &s;al|vation by Grace.</P>
<P>TO conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, therefore, let us take heed, while we acknowledge our &s;alvation to be of grace, that we do not pervert this doctrine to the encouraging of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, either in our|&s;elves or others. To the honor of God, and the go&s;pel of his Son, we are bound to confe&s;s, that we are &s;aved by Grace. But &s;urely it is not to his glory, nor to the honor of the Chri&s;tian reve|lation, to imagine that we are &s;aved by grace in any &s;uch &s;en&s;e, as would render obedience to our Saviour's commandments unnece&s;&s;ary. On the contrary, it would be highly di&s;honourable to both, to conceive thus. Such an imagination does, in effect, deve&s;t God of his holine&s;s, and all his moral perfections. It is to repre&s;ent him as giving men a di&s;pen&s;ation for indulging their lu&s;ts, by an expre&s;s revelation from heaven. For, in truth, what el&s;e is it, to a&s;&s;ert that the go&s;|pel
<PB N="124" REF="007488_0130_102B90661F5AA068">
is a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that even tho&s;e who live and dye in their &s;ins, are not excluded by the terms of it, from the hope of im|mortal happine&s;s? And that the gates of heaven are &s;et open to all tho&s;e who believe, whether they work righteou&s;ne&s;s or work iniquity? If this is not to repre&s;ent God as being indifferent to virtue and vice; if it is not to abu&s;e his grace, and turn it into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s; if it is not to make Chri&s;t the mini&s;ter of &s;in, rather than the Saviour of men from it; it will be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what is really &s;o; yea, that any thing can be &s;o. Nor can there be a greater di&s;honor done to Chri&s;tianity, than is done to it by tho&s;e who repre&s;ent it in this light.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE one of the wi&s;er &s;ort of <HI>Pagans,</HI> who had as yet never heard any thing concerning the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;hould have an account given thereof to this purpo&s;e; <Q>That it was a very <HI>gracious</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, ina&s;much as it did not require in its profe&s;&s;ors, &s;incere piety, and the practice of virtue, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to their being happy after death; but only re|commended the&s;e things as being decent, and a proper way of expre&s;&s;ing our gratitude to God; and that the mo&s;t vicious men, provided they hear and believe this revelation, tru&s;ting intirely to the righteou&s;ne&s;s and obedience of Him who&s;e name it bears, &s;hould certainly obtain eternal life:</Q> What would &s;uch an intelligent <HI>Pagan</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="007488_0131_102B9067A92A8F18">
naturally conclude? Certainly that this preacher of <HI>free Grace</HI> was be&s;ide him&s;elf; or, which is &s;till wor&s;e, that he was a very abandoned man, and not only vicious him&s;elf, but de&s;irous to corrupt others by his licentious doctrine. He would not believe that the religion, of which &s;uch an account was given him, was really a revelation from hea|ven; but would very naturally and ju&s;tly con|clude it was the invention of &s;ome wicked man, or, at be&s;t the dream of a weak one. But yet I am bold to &s;ay, that this is, and mu&s;t be, the account given of Chri&s;tianity, by all tho&s;e who deny the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience thereto, and of per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s; and who infer from the doctrine of our being &s;aved by grace, that we may be &s;aved without goodne&s;s. Take heed therefore, my Brethren, le&s;t any man deceive you, and le&s;t you deceive your own&s;elves, with vain empty words, and fal&s;e hopes. "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only." And re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>That</HI> doctrine which teaches that men may obtain &s;alvation, without <HI>cea&s;ing to do evil, and learning to do well;</HI> without yielding a &s;incere obedience to the laws of Chri&s;tianity; (that <HI>That</HI> doctrine, I &s;ay) is not &s;o properly called a DOCTRINE OF GRACE, as it is, a DOCTRINE OF DEVILS.</P>

<Q><HI>LAY apart all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s, and receive with meekne&s;s the ingrafted word, which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own &s;elves.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONGST other Things, the nece&s;&s;ity of our being doers of the word, and not hearers only, in order to our obtaining the &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;pel, has been di&s;tinctly &s;hown from this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture. But becau&s;e St. <HI>James</HI> here &s;peaks as if there was at lea&s;t &s;ome danger of our deluding our&s;elves
<PB N="128" REF="007488_0133_102B906BC1809908">
with an imagination, that obeying the go&s;|pel is not really nece&s;&s;ary to the mentioned end, in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e I entered upon a con&s;ideration of tho&s;e mi&s;takes re&s;pecting this important point, into which many Chri&s;tians have fallen, even from the early days of Chri&s;tianity; and to which the Apo&s;tle refers in &s;ome parts of this epi&s;tle. The errors and delu&s;ions which I here intend, re&s;pect the general &s;cheme of our &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, and the nature of that covenant of grace, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in and by Him. Which er|rors and delu&s;ions, have, I &s;uppo&s;e, chiefly proceeded from a mi&s;con&s;truction of cer|tain expre&s;&s;ions in the writings of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> And indeed St. <HI>Peter</HI> ob&s;erved long &s;ince, that in the epi&s;tles of this his beloved Bro|ther, there were "&s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which they that are unlearn|ed and un&s;table wre&s;t&mdash;unto their own de&s;truction."</P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ions which &s;eem at lea&s;t as likely to be thus wre&s;ted by the <HI>un|learned</HI> and <HI>un&s;table,</HI> as any other in tho&s;e epi&s;tles, are &s;uch as the&s;e; That we are <Q>&s;aved by grace; That we mu&s;t be found in Chri&s;t, not having our own righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that we are ju&s;tifi|ed by faith, without the deeds of the law.</Q> For from the&s;e, and &s;uch-like expre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="129" REF="007488_0134_102B906D5A6BC758">
&s;ome have in fact imagined, that per&s;o|nal righteou&s;ne&s;s, inherent holine&s;s, or obedience to the Go&s;pel, (call it which you plea&s;e) is not really nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to our acceptance with God, and to our obtaining the &s;alvation revealed to us, and purcha&s;ed for us, by Chri&s;t: And it is to be feared, that many, from age to age, have thus deceived them&s;elves to their own de&s;truction. The&s;e &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ions which have been perverted, &s;o as to render the commandments of God of none effect, and to annul the obliga|tions to evangelical obedience, terminate nearly in the &s;ame point at la&s;t. How|ever it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly; and to &s;how how far they are from countenancing any &s;uch licentious doctrines as have been grounded upon them. The former of them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we are "&s;aved by grace," was con&s;idered in the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>LET us now proceed to a con&s;iderati|on of the &s;econd, re&s;pecting our being <HI>found in Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. The pa&s;&s;age at large &s;tands thus in the epi&s;tle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Philip.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 7,&mdash;10.</NOTE> <Q>But what things were gain to me, the&s;e I coun|ted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t; yea doubtle&s;s, and I count all things but lo&s;s for the excel|lency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord; for whom I have &s;uffered

the lo&s;s of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chri&s;t: And be found in him, not having mine own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the faith of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his re&s;urrection, and the fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings, being made conformable to his death.</Q></P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age having been made great u&s;e of, in order to &s;how, that our own per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s is of little or no ac|count in the &s;ight of God; and that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, imputed to us, and received by faith, is the &s;ole ground of our acceptance with Him, I &s;hall con|&s;ider it the more carefully and di&s;tinctly. I will give &s;ome &s;hort and general ac|count of St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s de&s;ign here: And then point out more particularly, both what that righteou&s;ne&s;s is which he here di&s;|claims and renounces, and what that is which he builds his hopes upon, and glories in. From whence, I doubt not, it will appear, that he is &s;o far from con|tradicting any thing which has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, concerning the nece&s;&s;i|ty of obedience to the Go&s;pel, that he, in effect, a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame thing him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="007488_0136_102B90717771A250">
NOW it is to be remembred, and par|ticularly ob&s;erved, for the right under|&s;tanding of this pa&s;&s;age, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was, both by birth and religion, a <HI>Jew:</HI> He had been educated in the principles and prac|tices of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> as he him&s;elf in|forms us. He had been &s;o zealous in this way, as to become, very early, a bitter enemy to the name and religion of Chri&s;t; and thus he continued to be, 'til he was miraculou&s;ly converted to the Chri&s;tian faith, in his journey to <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> And the pa&s;&s;age quoted above, repre&s;ents to us in general, how entirely his &s;entiments concerning religion, and the way of ac|ceptance with God, were changed from what they had formerly been:&mdash;how contemptibly he now tho't of many things, in which, while he was a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> he gloried in, and depended upon, as a &s;ufficient and acceptable righteou&s;ne&s;s:&mdash;how highly he now accounted of Chri&s;t, who&s;e name he was wont to bla&s;pheme; and who&s;e di&s;ciples he had per&s;ecuted:&mdash;how &s;ollicitous he was to attain to that righteou&s;ne&s;s which the go&s;pel pre&s;cribes, and to that Salvation which is therein re|vealed to &s;inful Men. This is the general de&s;ign and &s;cope of the pa&s;&s;age we are con&s;idering. And &s;urely a per&s;on newly converted from <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI>
<PB N="132" REF="007488_0137_102B9073703F6120">
from a per&s;ecuting <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> to a di&s;ciple of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to under|value all his former attainments in religion, and to renounce all dependance upon them for &s;alvation, without being &s;up|po&s;ed to undervalue that obedience which the go&s;pel requires, or to renounce all de|pendence thereupon in the grand affair of his acceptance with God, and obtaining eternal Life. My meaning is, that it does not follow from the Apo&s;tle's di&s;claiming, and depreciating the former righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he mu&s;t di&s;claim and depreciate the latter al&s;o. For tho' one may be really worthle&s;s and in&s;ignificant, the other may be truly valuable, and acceptable in the &s;ight of God. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of a <HI>Pha|ri&s;ee,</HI> may be contemptible, and yet the obedience of a Chri&s;tian be of great price, and great efficacy with God. Unle&s;s it can be &s;hown that the Apo&s;tle here re|nounces &s;ome other righteou&s;ne&s;s than a <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> one, as that is oppo&s;ed to the obedience and good works of a &s;incere Chri&s;tian, this pa&s;&s;age is not to the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e who alledge it in order to prove, that a Chri&s;tian's obedience is not that which entitles him to the &s;alvation which Chri&s;t has wrought out, and which is re|vealed to us in his go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="007488_0138_102B9075F926BCC0">
LET us, therefore, as was propo&s;ed inquire a little more particularly, what righteou&s;ne&s;s that is, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> re|nounces? whether it is only the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> or the obedience and good works of a Chri&s;tian? And for the re&s;olving of this point, let us go to the preceeding context, where he gives us an account of what, as a <HI>Jew</HI> and a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> he had formerly valued him&s;elf upon.</P>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to the unconverted <HI>Jews,</HI> who relied upon their external privileges, upon their circumci&s;ion, and other ritual ob&s;ervances, he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>We are the circumci|&s;ion, which wor&s;hip God in the &s;pirit, and re|joice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h, ver.</HI> 3. As if he had &s;aid, "The <HI>Jews</HI> vaunt of their being circumci&s;ed: But we Chri&s;tians, altho' we may not have externally received that rite, are yet the true &s;piritual &s;eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> being circumci&s;ed in heart, which is the thing &s;ignified by that outward &s;ign. We are more truly the circumci&s;ion, according to the &s;piritual meaning of the law, than they who glory only in the vi&s;ible &s;ym|bole of internal purity: For we &s;erve God in &s;pirit and in truth; and glory in our relation to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the end of the law; having no dependence on
<PB N="134" REF="007488_0139_102B907785137040">
tho&s;e carnal ordinances, and weak and beggarly elements, which they who are &s;till zealous of the law, value them&s;elves upon." <HI>Though I might al&s;o have confidence in the fle&s;h. If any man thinketh he hath whereof he might tru&s;t in the fle&s;h, I more.</HI> ver. 4. <HI>q. d.</HI> "Think not that I &s;peak with con|tempt of the&s;e fle&s;hly ordinances, from a principle of envy; or becau&s;e I could not glory in the ob&s;ervation of them as well as others, if I judged this was any ju&s;t ground of confidence. No: If &s;uch things might ju&s;tly be tru&s;ted in; if any man whatever can, with rea&s;on, place his dependence upon things of this na|ture, I am bold to &s;ay that I my&s;elf can do it with as much ju&s;tice and propriety, as any other per&s;on; yea with more than the greater part of tho&s;e that do &s;o." The Apo&s;tle proceeds to explain him&s;elf in the next words&mdash;<HI>Circumci&s;ed the eighth day, of the &s;tock of I&s;rael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Phari&s;ee.</HI>" ver 5. <HI>q. d.</HI> "You may judge by what follows, with how much more ju&s;tice I could glory in <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> privileges, and legal, ceremonious ob&s;ervances, than mo&s;t other per&s;ons, did I value my&s;elf upon them. For I was circumci&s;ed exactly on the eighth day, according to the very letter of the law;
<PB N="135" REF="007488_0140_102B9079B8BC17F8">
which is more than every Jew can boa&s;t. I de&s;cended directly from the loins of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and am one of the tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who was &s;o peculiarly beloved of our common Father: I am not a pro|&s;elyte, nor the &s;on of a pro&s;elyte, but a natural born <HI>Jew,</HI> a branch &s;prung up from the original &s;tock of the <HI>Hebrews:</HI> And I was moreover one of that &s;ect, which is of the greate&s;t note and reputa|tion among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> the &s;ect of the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI>" The Apo&s;tle proceeds with the catalogue of his privileges, &amp;c. <HI>Con|cerning zeal, per&s;ecuting the church; touch|ing the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law, blamele&s;s.</HI> ver. 6. <HI>q. d.</HI> "Nor was I one of the cold, lifele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> religion: So far from it, that I di&s;tingui&s;hed my&s;elf by my zeal for it; yea, &s;o warm and &s;anguine was I in the cau&s;e, that I exerted my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, to beat down all that did, or &s;eemed to oppo&s;e it; and accordingly became a violent per&s;ecutor of the church of Chri&s;t. And, to &s;um up all in one word, I was &s;o &s;trict an ob&s;erver of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> ac|cording to the common way of interpre|ting it, that no per&s;on, however critical and zealous, could blame me, or tax me with deviating from the righteou&s;ne&s;s of it."</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="007488_0141_102B907B46678E90">
NOW the&s;e are the things which St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;erts, gave him greater ground of confidence, and glorying in the fle&s;h, than mo&s;t of his countrymen, who &s;till adhered to the law in oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel, could pretend to: Upon which, however, he renounces all dependence for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and acceptance with God. But it will be proper to inquire more particu|larly into the Apo&s;tle's meaning, in the la&s;t words quoted above, where he &s;ays that he had been <HI>blamele&s;s, touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s that is in the law;</HI> this being, as I apprehend, a point of con&s;iderable importance. By this, then, I think he mu&s;t intend one or the other of the three things following: Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT he had been, in the mo&s;t &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, perfect and &s;in|le&s;s: Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT he had been blamele&s;s and perfect in a lower and le&s;s proper &s;en&s;e; as other good men under the law were &s;aid to be, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome deviations from their duty: Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT he had been blamele&s;s with relation to the ceremonial part of the law; which it &s;eems, the Jews of that corrupt, degenerate age, generally e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t excellent, and chiefly gloried in.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="007488_0142_102B907D40404520">
THE righteou&s;ne&s;s which the apo&s;tle here intends, whatever it be, he certain|ly di&s;claims as an in&s;ufficient ground of tru&s;t and dependence, in the next words.&mdash;<HI>But what things were gain to me, tho&s;e I counted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t.</HI> The connecti|on plainly &s;hows, that he contemned and di&s;pi&s;ed all his former righteou&s;ne&s;s, in compari&s;on of that which is of God by faith.</P>
<P>NOW we may be very certain that the Apo&s;tle is not to be under&s;tood in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e mentioned: He does not mean, that he had perfectly kept the whole law of MOSES, in its greate&s;t extent and lati|tude. For (1) it is generally acknow|ledged by Chri&s;tians, that that law com|prehends the law of nature, as well as the law of ceremonies, and carnal ordinan|ces: In which latitude, our Saviour him|&s;elf expounds it. (2) St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays expre&s;sly, in his epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> that all, <HI>Jews</HI> as well as <HI>Gentiles, have &s;in|ned;</HI> that all the world is become guilty before God; and that every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped. In which places he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak exclu&s;ively of him|&s;elf. (3) We divers times find him la|menting the &s;ins which he had commit|ted, while he was in his <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tate; particularly that of per&s;ecuting the church
<PB N="138" REF="007488_0143_102B90803B18E030">
of Chri&s;t. (4) If he had been perfect in this &s;en&s;e, he could not have undervalued &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s, or needed any other. For a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s is undoubtedly &s;ufficient for any man: And the language of the law it&s;elf is, "That the man that doth the&s;e things, &s;hall live in them." From the&s;e con&s;iderations, not to mention any more, it is evident that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> by his having been <HI>blamele&s;s touching the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law,</HI> could not in|tend that he had perfectly obeyed the law in its utmo&s;t latitude and rigor.</P>
<P>IT remains, therefore, that he is to be under&s;tood either in the &s;econd or third &s;en&s;e mentioned: i. e. That he had been blamele&s;s and perfect, as other good men under the law, were &s;aid to be, not|with&s;tanding &s;ome deviations from it: Or that he had, with the greate&s;t punctu|ality, ob&s;erved the ritual part of it, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from the moral. Let us con&s;ider, which of the&s;e things he in|tends. And that he is to be under&s;tood in the la&s;t mentioned &s;en&s;e, will, I think, appear very probable at lea&s;t, from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT does not appear from St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s &s;tory, as we have it in the new te&s;tament, that he was really a good man, antece|dently to his conver&s;ion to the faith of
<PB N="139" REF="007488_0144_102B9081C70378A0">

Chri&s;t; or that he had any righteou&s;ne&s;s be&s;ides that which was proper to his &s;ect, as a <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> And how much this righte|ou&s;ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in outward formalities, and ceremonious u&s;ages: how little of good morality went into the compo&s;ition of a <HI>Phari&s;ee'</HI>s righteou&s;ne&s;s; how far it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell &s;hort of that &s;incere piety and undi&s;&s;em|bled virtue, which was e&s;&s;ential to a right|eous character, even under the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> no one can be ignorant, who has read the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> with due attention. That which our Saviour terms, <HI>The righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees,</HI> did not in|clude in it real &s;anctity of heart and man|ners; &s;uch as good men under the law were the &s;ubjects of. If it had, he would not &s;urely have told us, that except our righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>exceeds</HI> it, we cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven: For it will not, I pre&s;ume, be doubted but that all truly pious and holy men, whether under the legal or evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;hall not actually be admitted into that king|dom hereafter. How does it appear, that the Apo&s;tle was a better man than tho&s;e of his &s;ect generally were; who, as is plain from our Saviour's account of them, were not only imperfect, as the be&s;t men are in this world; but de&s;titute of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which is attainable; and of
<PB N="140" REF="007488_0145_102B908376018020">
which many good men under the law were actually the &s;ubjects? It is not very ea&s;y to reconcile the &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>Saul'</HI>s being a good man, with the known fact of his being &s;o bitter a per&s;ecutor of the church; and his continuing to breath out threatenings and &s;laughter again&s;t it, for &s;o long a time together. To de&s;ire to do the will of God, is e&s;&s;ential to the charac|ter of a good man: And our Saviour had &s;aid, That <Q>if any man would do his will, he &s;hould know of his doctrine whether it were of God, or whether he &s;pake of him&s;elf.</Q> Can it ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, then, that <HI>Soul,</HI> had he been really a good and upright man, could have been, for &s;o long a time, under a mi&s;take in this matter; and been &s;o outrageou&s;ly zealous as he was, to extirpate the religion of Chri&s;t? I will not ab&s;olutely deny the po&s;&s;ibility of this; but yet think it is very improbable. Be&s;ides, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems, in &s;ome of his epi&s;tles, to attribute his be|coming a good man, to his becoming a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t; particularly where he &s;ays, that it was "the law of the &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, that had made him free from the law of &s;in and death." Now if his conver&s;ion from &s;in to God, was co|temporary with his conver&s;ion from <HI>Ju|dai&s;m</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> (which is probable
<PB N="141" REF="007488_0146_102B9085717E7C88">
from the account he gives of him&s;elf) it follows, that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law, he mu&s;t mean only that external, <HI>phari&s;aical</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s before-mentioned; not that internal and &s;anctity, of which good men were the &s;ubjects un|der the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps be objected, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares he verily tho't with him&s;elf that he ought to do tho&s;e things which he did, contrary to the name of Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth;</HI> that he had lived, before his becoming a Chri&s;tian, in all good con&s;cience towards God: And that this &s;uppo&s;es him to have been a righteous man, in the qualified &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, antecedently to his conver&s;ion to the faith of Chri&s;t. However this &s;eems not to be conclu&s;ive and &s;atisfactory: For there are doubtle&s;s many wicked men who act con|&s;cientiou&s;ly, e&s;pecially in the bu&s;ine&s;s of per&s;ecution, when their heads are heated with religious, party-di&s;putes, and their hearts burn with a fal&s;e zeal. Men may act con&s;cientiou&s;ly, for the time, in things of this nature, and indeed in almo&s;t all others; and yet not be truly good and virtuous. When our Saviour tells his di&s;|ciples that <Q>the time would come, when who&s;oever killed them, would <HI>think that he did God &s;ervice;</HI></Q> I &s;uppo&s;e none
<PB N="142" REF="007488_0147_102B9087CE33AA78">
imagine that he means good and virtuous men would do thus, merely becau&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to act con&s;cientiou&s;ly towards God, thinking they do &s;ervice to him. No; The obvious &s;en&s;e is, that men of corrupt minds, and de&s;titute of the truth, would be &s;o infatuated, &s;o blinded with bigotry, and enmity again&s;t the go&s;pel, that they would per&s;ecute even to death, the preachers and profe&s;&s;ors of it, not on|ly without pity and remor&s;e, but even with a firm per&s;wa&s;ion that they were di&s;charging their duty to God; i. e. with a good con&s;cience towards Him. It is not therefore implied in what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays of him&s;elf, that he had been a truly right|eous, good man. It does not nece&s;|&s;arily, or naturally, amount to any thing more than this, all circum&s;tances being con&s;idered; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That he had been zeal|ous in the religion he profe&s;&s;ed; a con|&s;cientious ob&s;erver of the law, as interpre|ted by the <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> and that when he was embruing his hands in the blood of the innocent, he was &s;o far from doing what he knew to be &s;inful, that he fol|lowed the dictates of a mi&s;taken con|&s;cience. All which is rather an evidence, that the light within him was then dark|ne&s;s, and that he was depraved to great degree, than that he was really the pious

man, and <HI>&s;trict morali&s;t,</HI> which &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e him to have been.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the Apo&s;tle is not to be un|der&s;tood as a&s;&s;erting that he had been a careful ob&s;erver of the moral part of the law, appears from hence. He is here arguing again&s;t the <HI>Jews;</HI> and evidently &s;peaks of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law, according to the notions and inter|pretations thereof, which generally pre|vailed among&s;t them: He rea&s;ons with them, or rather again&s;t them, upon their own principles, in order to confute them the more effectually. And is it not ma|nife&s;t from the new te&s;tament, that the righteou&s;ne&s;s which the <HI>Jews</HI> of this time, e&s;pecially the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> laid the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon, and chiefly gloried in, was a mere ceremonious, or ritual righteou&s;|ne&s;s? a righteou&s;ne&s;s, which had little or no concern with their hearts and morals? This was evidently the ca&s;e. And it is much the mo&s;t natural &s;uppo&s;ition, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> here u&s;es the&s;e terms, [the right|eou&s;ne&s;s which is in the Law] in the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> &s;en&s;e of them; intending &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s thereby, as the&s;e words would have &s;ignified in the mouth of a common <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> It was not directly to his purpo&s;e, to u&s;e them in any higher, or more exalted &s;en&s;e.</P>

3. THIS is farther evident, <Q>Becau&s;e he &s;peaks of &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s as was reckoned matter of <HI>confidence in the fle&s;h;</HI> which is his way of de&s;cribing the po&s;itive part of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> law, which was of a carnal nature, related to, and affected the fle&s;h; whereas the moral righteou&s;ne&s;s therein required was not <HI>fle&s;hly;</HI> nor is it, that I remem|ber, ever &s;poken of as &s;uch.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P N="4">4. THE particular things which the Apo&s;tle enumerates in this pa&s;&s;age, as giv|ing him greater rea&s;on of confidence and boa&s;ting, than many others could pretend to, are all relative to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> oeconomy;&mdash;his lineal de&s;cent from <HI>Abraham, circumci&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c. He does not &s;o much as hint at any particular branch of true moral righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he could ju&s;tly lay claim to, unle&s;s his per&s;e|cuting zeal can be looked upon as &s;uch. Now if the Apo&s;tle had really intended to repre&s;ent him&s;elf as a pious, virtuous man, antecedently to his becoming a Chri&s;tian, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would have in|&s;tanced only in his <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> privileges, and
<PB N="145" REF="007488_0150_102B908B38E66BE8">
things of a ceremonious, external nature? Is it not much more natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that he would, in this ca&s;e, have in&s;tan|ced in the great and important precepts of the moral Law, which he had care|fully ob&s;erved? He certainly knew, at the time of his writing this epi&s;tle, what|ever he did before, that the keeping of the&s;e latter commandments, was much more commendable, and acceptable in the &s;ight of God, than the things of which he &s;peaks; but yet wholly omits them. This is, I think, a plain demon&s;tration, that by his having been blamele&s;s touch|ing the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law, he means no more, than that he had kept the ceremonial law with the utmo&s;t pre|ci&s;ion and exactne&s;s; &s;o as to &s;tand, in that re&s;pect, at lea&s;t upon an equal foot|ing with any of his countrymen.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF by the righteou&s;ne&s;s that is in the law, the Apo&s;tle had intended the moral purity and good works required thereby; it is not &s;uppo&s;eable that he would have &s;poken of it, in the ver&s;es immediately following, in &s;uch &s;trong terms of contempt as he does; &s;aying that he counted it <HI>lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>dung.</HI> Indeed he often &s;peaks, in other places, of the mo&s;t compleat righteou&s;ne&s;s of the be&s;t men, as imperfect; as attended with &s;ome faults and failings; and therefore
<PB N="146" REF="007488_0151_102B908DA63A77F0">
in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them before God, according to the rigor of law: But this is a very different thing, from &s;tyling &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>dung:</HI> Nor do the &s;criptures any where authori&s;e our &s;peaking of the moral virtues of good men in &s;uch contemptuous lan|guage. This is incon&s;i&s;tent with the whole &s;pirit, and the con&s;tant language of &s;cripture; wherein the moral virtues of good men are always mentioned with honor, and the highe&s;t epithets of commendation. But if we &s;uppo&s;e the Apo&s;tle intends only tho&s;e <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> privi|leges, and that ceremonious righteou&s;|ne&s;s, wherein the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> chiefly tru&s;t|ed, without any reference to the <HI>weigh|tier matters of the law;</HI> it will be ea&s;y to account for his &s;peaking of &s;uch a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the manner he does. This righteou&s;ne&s;s, not containing in it any thing truly good, but con&s;i&s;ting merely in the <HI>form of godline&s;s</HI> without the <HI>power,</HI> might be fitly enough compared to <HI>dung,</HI> or to <HI>filthy rags;</HI> and renounced as a worthle&s;s thing. But to &s;peak in &s;uch reproachful language of the moral virtues, which con&s;i&s;t &s;ummarily in the love of God and man, and an imitation of the divine perfections; is, in it&s;elf &s;o ab&s;urd, and approaches &s;o near to profanity and
<PB N="147" REF="007488_0152_102B908FE3AB2A20">
bla&s;phemy, that I cannot think &s;o wi&s;e and good a man as St. <HI>Paul</HI> could ever be guilty of it. He always &s;peaks in quite a different &s;train concerning obedi|ence to the moral part of the law; tho', as was &s;aid before, he a&s;&s;erts that no man has &s;o exactly and perfectly obeyed the law, as to be ju&s;tified thereby; and therefore admoni&s;hes us to rely upon the grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as revealed in the Go&s;pel, for acceptance with him.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;everal rea&s;ons mentioned, I think we may conclude, with a good degree of certainty, that when the A|po&s;tle declares he had been "blamele&s;s touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s that is in the law", his meaning is not, that he had been &s;inle&s;s; nor even that he had been a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the moral part of the law, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with common human frailty: But only, that he had been righteous in the <HI>phari&s;aical</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word; that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the righteou&s;ne&s;s which that &s;ect tru&s;ted in; which gave them confidence in the fle&s;h; and which con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t wholly in cer|tain external privileges, and ceremonious u&s;ages; as appears fully from the new-te&s;tament, particularly from the following pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;"The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and all the Jews except they wa&s;h their hands eat

not&mdash;And many other things there be, which they have received to hold; as the wa&s;hing of cups and pots, and brazen ve&s;&s;els and tables"&mdash;"Woe unto you, Scribes and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> hypocrites; for ye tythe mint and ani&s;e and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the law"&mdash;"Ye make clean the out-&s;ide of the cup and the platter; but within are full of extortion and exce&s;s&mdash;Ye are like un|to whited &s;epulchres, which indeed ap|pear beautiful outward; but are within full of dead mens bones and all unclean|ne&s;s: Even &s;o ye appear righteous unto men; but within ye are full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity"&mdash;"Ye make void the law of God thro' your traditions."&mdash;The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages give you a true Idea of the reli|gion chiefly in vogue, in the days of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles; I mean a|mong&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> e&s;pecially the &s;ect of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> that <HI>&s;trait &s;ect,</HI> to which St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays he belonged. And this is manife&s;tly the righteou&s;ne&s;s which this Apo&s;tle intends in the pa&s;&s;age we are con&s;idering; which he calls <HI>the righteou&s;|ne&s;s that is in the law;</HI> and <HI>his own righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This is that righteou&s;ne&s;s which he once depended upon, accounting it <HI>gain</HI> to him; and which he afterwards renounced, accounting it no better than
<PB N="149" REF="007488_0154_102B9093555699C8">
<HI>lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>dung,</HI> in compari&s;on of <HI>the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith.</HI> Nor can there well be a greater perver&s;ion of his meaning, and true de&s;ign, than to repre|&s;ent him as &s;peaking in this manner con|cerning that real holine&s;s and moral good|ne&s;s, by which men are made like to the ble&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>LET me make one &s;hort reflection here before I proceed any further. Since it is plain that the Apo&s;tle, by <HI>his own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which he renounces in &s;uch &s;trong terms of contempt, means only his <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> priviledges, and an external <HI>phari|&s;aical</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s; this &s;hows the ab&s;ur|dity of applying what is here &s;aid to the virtues and good works of Chri&s;tians; of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who live under the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, and practically conform them&s;elves to it. Such per&s;ons, are often told, that they mu&s;t have no dependence upon <HI>their own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> their virtues and good works; that this righteou&s;ne&s;s, is no better than <HI>dung,</HI> &amp;c. And all this loo&s;e, irrational kind of talk, is pretended to be grounded upon, and &s;upported by, the doctrine of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> particularly in the pa&s;&s;age now under con&s;ideration. Whereas it is very manife&s;t, that this great Apo&s;tle had not the lea&s;t reference to the good works of Chri&s;tians; nor even to
<PB N="150" REF="007488_0155_102B909590BF00A8">
the moral duties required by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> but only to that &s;uperficial, cere|monious righteou&s;ne&s;s, in which the <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI> were wont to tru&s;t and to glory; a righteou&s;ne&s;s altogether different from, and inferior to, that which is intended by tho&s;e, who &s;o zealou&s;ly warn us not to have any dependence upon our obedi|ence to Chri&s;t's commandments; &s;o total|ly different from it, that no argument can be drawn from one to the other. And how well &s;oever tho&s;e may mean, who apply what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays concerning his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, while he was a per&s;ecuting <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> to evangelical obedi|ence; it is demon&s;trable that they gro&s;ly wre&s;t his meaning; and in&s;til very fal&s;e and pernicious notions of religion into the minds of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed: Having &s;een what the apo&s;tle here intends by his <HI>own righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is <HI>in,</HI> or <HI>of, the law;</HI> and which he di&s;claims as being of little or no value; let us now inquire what it is which he oppo&s;es thereto; and in which he tru&s;ts and triumphs.</P>
<P>NOW he tells us, that he de&s;pi&s;ed his own former righteou&s;ne&s;s; and account|ed it as lo&s;s and dung, for [or in compa|ri&s;on of] <HI>the excellency of the knowledge of
<PB N="151" REF="007488_0156_102B909824DA5380">
Chri&s;t Je&s;us his Lord:&mdash;that he might win Chri&s;t, and be found in him&mdash;having the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is thro' the faith of Chri&s;t; the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith; that he might know him, and the pow|er of his re&s;urrection, and the fellow&s;hip of his &s;ufferings, being made conformable unto his death</HI>&mdash;The &s;everal things here men|tioned, the Apo&s;tle oppo&s;es to his former righteou&s;ne&s;s, while he was a <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> Let us con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly, that we may &s;ee, whether they do not compri&s;e in them obedience to the go&s;pel? and con&s;equently, whether the Apo&s;tle does not rather oppo&s;e his <HI>own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which was of the <HI>law,</HI> to <HI>evangelical pu|rity</HI> and <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> than to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t <HI>imputed?</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing he mentions is, <HI>the ex|cellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us his Lord.</HI> By which knowledge, if he di|rectly intends nothing more than a gene|ral &s;peculative knowledge of Chri&s;t, and the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation; yet this will make nothing again&s;t the worth and im|portance of evangelical obedience. But if, as it is mo&s;t probable, he means what &s;ome call a practical experimental know|ledge of Chri&s;t; or &s;uch a knowledge as is productive of obedience to his com|mandments; then this is not only no ob|jection
<PB N="152" REF="007488_0157_102B9099ABC97900">
again&s;t, but a direct confirmation of, what has been &s;aid upon this point. For the Apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e will then be, that he contemned his former, <HI>phari&s;aical</HI> righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, as worthle&s;s, in compari&s;on of that real purity and &s;anctity, of which tho&s;e are the &s;ubjects, who truly know Chri&s;t. And in this complex &s;en&s;e, the knowledge of Chri&s;t is often to be under|&s;tood in the new te&s;tament: <HI>i. e.</HI> it com|prehends both a &s;peculative knowledge of him, and a frame of mind, and an ex|ternal behaviour, conformable thereto. Thus it is &s;aid, <HI>Hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that &s;aith I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a Lyar and the truth is not in him.</HI> So it is &s;aid to be <HI>life eternal, to know the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath &s;ent.</HI> This mu&s;t mean, to know God, and his only begotten Son, &s;o as to love and &s;erve them, in the man|ner the go&s;pel requires us to do.

<P>THE Apo&s;tle adds&mdash;<HI>That I may win Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>St. <HI>Paul</HI> here carries on a very hand&s;om and agreable allegory, in which all the metaphors are taken from traders or merchants&mdash;He &s;eems here to con&s;ider Chri&s;t, as the mo&s;t important and valuable thing, which he was therefore &s;ollicitous to &s;ecure to him&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;Mr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rce.</HI></NOTE>.

The expre&s;&s;ion here u&s;ed is &s;o general and indeterminate, that no argument can be drawn from hence, either for or a|gain&s;t, what I am now more particularly endeavouring to &s;how.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins&mdash;<HI>and be found in him.</HI> The phra&s;e [being <HI>in Chri&s;t</HI>] is u|&s;ed in a twofold &s;en&s;e in the new te&s;ta|ment. Sometimes it intends no more than an outward profe&s;&s;ion of his name and religion; or being a member of his vi&s;ible Church, which is his body. At other times it means being in him as his true di&s;ciples and followers: and intere&s;t|ed, by faith and &s;incere obedience, in that &s;alvation which he has purcha&s;ed for all &s;uch. Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> explains it; "He that <HI>keepeth his commandments,</HI> dwelleth <HI>in him.</HI>" And St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf; [<HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 1.] "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who <HI>walk not after the fle&s;h,</HI> but <HI>af|ter the &s;pirit.</HI>" Agreably hereto, it is &s;aid in the <HI>apocalyp&s;e,</HI> that ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die <HI>in the Lord</HI>&mdash;; for they re&s;t from their labours, and <HI>their works do fol|low

them.</HI>" From the&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages it appears, that to be <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> in the mo&s;t eminent and important &s;en&s;e of the Phra&s;e, is to be intere&s;ted in the redempti|on and &s;alvation which he has wrought out, by <HI>keeping his commandments;</HI> by <HI>walking after the &s;pirit;</HI> or by doing tho&s;e good <HI>works,</HI> which are &s;aid to <HI>follow</HI> the righteous into another world, when they depart out of this.</P>
<P>NOW when the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es his ardent de&s;ire, that he might be found <HI>in Chri&s;t;</HI> it &s;eems mo&s;t natural to under|&s;tand him in this latter &s;en&s;e, i. e. as wi&s;hing to be found and acknowledged at la&s;t, as one of Chri&s;t's faithful &s;ervants; one of tho&s;e, to whom the great and pre|cious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are made. We can &s;carce &s;uppo&s;e that he would ex|pre&s;s &s;o great a &s;ollicitude as he here does, to be found in Chri&s;t, only by an out|ward and formal profe&s;&s;ion of his religi|on; or by faith alone, as it is oppo&s;ed to evangelical obedience. To be found in Chri&s;t in this &s;en&s;e only, he certainly knew would avail him nothing at the la&s;t day. And if we under&s;tand him in the other, as we ought undoubtedly to do; &s;urely there is nothing here which looks like di&s;paraging, or undervaluing, the virtues and good works of Chri&s;tians; or which
<PB N="155" REF="007488_0160_102B909EF3876BE8">
intimates that the Apo&s;tle di&s;claimed all tru&s;t and dependence upon his living in obedience to Chri&s;t's laws. His words imply the direct contrary: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be a faithful and o|bedient &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, as the only way of obtaining &s;alvation by him.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle goes on&mdash;<HI>Not having mine own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law; but that which is thro' the faith of Chri&s;t; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith.</HI> What he means by his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was of the law; has been particularly &s;hown above; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> his <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> priviledg|es, and his &s;trict adherence to the cere|monial part of the law, according to the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> So that the in|quiry now is only, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> intends by the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is <HI>thro' the faith of Chri&s;t,</HI> the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is <HI>of God by faith;</HI> and which he oppo&s;es to that righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, on which he had formerly relied.</P>
<P>NOW by this he may po&s;&s;ibly mean, that real holine&s;s of heart and manners, which is the genuine effect of faith, of faith in Chri&s;t, and in God thro' him. Agreable to this interpretation, we read of faith that <HI>worketh by love,</HI> that <HI>over|cometh the world,</HI> and the like. And e|vangelical righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that holine&s;s,
<PB N="156" REF="007488_0161_102B90A12B0FF4D0">
the root and principle of which is faith; as it might be properly enough termed the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is thro' the faith of Chri&s;t, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith; &s;o it might, with equal propriety, be oppo&s;ed to <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> priviledges, and an external, <HI>phari&s;aical</HI> conformity to the law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> And this righteou&s;ne&s;s might be &s;aid to be <HI>of God,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to the other, either becau&s;e it is that righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which He has pre&s;cribed and required, and promi&s;ed to accept; or be|cau&s;e it is attained by grace and help de|rived from Him. And if we under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle thus, as many do, not with|out &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on; this pa&s;|&s;age will &s;urely make directly again&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e practice it is to &s;peak con|temptuou&s;ly of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> obedience; and to repre&s;ent it as being of no efficacy to|wards procuring Acceptance with God, and eternal life. Nor does this interpre|tation render the obedience and atone|ment of Chri&s;t needle&s;s; for it is only thro' him, that our imperfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s is accepted and rewarded.</P>
<P>However, there is another interpretation, which &s;eems rather more agreable to the doctrine and language of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in other places; and which is, I think, to be prefer|red accordingly. By <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> here, I

<P>THUS I have endeavoured to explain this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, wherein the Apo&s;tle, renouncing his own righteou&s;|ne&s;s which was of the law, as in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify him, and give him a title to e|ternal life, betakes him&s;elf to the pardon|ing mercy and grace of God, revealed in
<PB N="164" REF="007488_0169_102B90B0C5E53378">
the Go&s;pel of his Son, thro' faith. And I think it appears that tho&s;e who apply it to the controver&s;y among&s;t Chri&s;tians at this day, concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith and works, as if it favoured the <HI>modern notion</HI> of ju&s;ti|fication thro' the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, imputed to us, and received by faith alone, intirely mi&s;take the &s;cope, and true &s;pirit of the pa&s;&s;age. It relates to an old di&s;pute betwixt the unchri&s;tia|nized <HI>Jews,</HI> who boa&s;ted of their privi|leges, and depended upon an external, ceremonious righteou&s;ne&s;s; and the di&s;|ciples of Chri&s;t, who a&s;&s;erted the in&s;uffi|ciency of &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the par|doning mercy of God, as revealed to Sinners thro' his Son. And that which the apo&s;tle here expre&s;&s;es &s;o ardent a de|&s;ire after, is neither more nor le&s;s than this, that he might be, both in faith and practice, a Chri&s;tian, in order to his be|ing intitled to the divine acceptance, and life eternal. It is a gro&s;s perverting of &s;cripture, to interpret this pa&s;&s;age, as if the Apo&s;tle had been &s;peaking of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works</HI> of <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in the <HI>modern</HI> &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e terms, oppo&s;ing one of them to the other; and repre&s;enting the former, exclu&s;ively of the latter, as what intitles us to the Salvation purcha&s;ed by

Chri&s;t. Nothing could well be more re|mote from his true de&s;ign; or more in|con&s;i&s;tent with the general tenor of &s;crip|ture. It may be added, that giving this turn to the pa&s;&s;age has a natural and di|rect tendency to make Chri&s;tians le&s;s cau|tious and circum&s;pect, le&s;s careful to live up to their profe&s;&s;ion, than they ought to be.</P>
<P>ALAS! could &s;orrow enter the man&s;i|ons of the ble&s;&s;ed, how would it affect this holy Apo&s;tle to &s;ee his doctrine abu|&s;ed to the encouraging of Vice and licen|ciou&s;ne&s;s, to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e &s;ouls, for which Chri&s;t died! We cannot be ignorant how &s;ollicitous he was, while he was fulfilling the mini&s;try which he had received of the Lord, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould adorn their lives with a conver&s;a|tion becoming their high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and how much he was grieved when he &s;aw any contradict their profe&s;&s;ion by their behaviour. In this very epi&s;tle, yea in this very chapter, a part of which we have been con&s;idering, he has left us a proof hereof. "Many walk, &s;ays he, of whom I have told you oft, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t; who&s;e end is de&s;truction, who&s;e God is their belly, and who&s;e glory is in their

&s;hame; who mind earthly things." Nor was he le&s;s careful to live piou&s;ly and virtuou&s;ly him&s;elf, le&s;t he &s;hould fall &s;hort of &s;alvation at la&s;t, than he was to inculcate the practice of religion upon o|thers. Both his manner of preaching, and his manner of living, with the great motive of it, may be judged of by the following pa&s;&s;age in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI>&mdash;"Know ye not that they which run in a race, run all; but one receiveth the prize: So run that ye may obtain. And every one that &s;triveth for the ma&s;tery, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I there|fore &s;o run, not as uncertainly; &s;o fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t that by any means when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away." This, &s;urely, is not the language of One, who thought his Salvation &s;ecured by faith in the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Another, without holine&s;s, and per&s;everance therein to the end.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the holy &s;crip|tures a&s;&s;ure us, that all the impeni|tent workers of iniquity &s;hall be con|demned in the judgment of the great Day; notwith&s;tanding they &s;o plainly teach us, that only the pure in heart &s;hall &s;ee God; notwith&s;tanding we are &s;o fre|quently admoni&s;hed to be doers of the word; and not to hope for the favour of God, either here or hereafter, without for&s;aking our &s;ins, and working righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;

notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Things, I &s;ay, it is very hard to convince &s;ome people, that they cannot be accept|ed of God thro' Chri&s;t, upon other and ea&s;ier terms than &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem, at fir&s;t view, to imply in them.</P>
<P>IN the two la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, I con&s;ider|ed, and endeavoured to refute, two mi&s;|taken notions re&s;pecting this important point; which notions are grounded up|on a mi&s;con&s;truction of tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture, that we are <HI>&s;aved by grace;</HI> and, that we mu&s;t be <HI>found in Chri&s;t, not having our own righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ion, which has not been le&s;s abu&s;ed, to &s;erve the cau&s;e of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, than either of the former. The expre&s;&s;ion I intend, is that which occurs divers times in the e|pi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we are <HI>ju&s;|tified by faith.</HI> This &s;eems to have been the <HI>&s;heet-anchor,</HI> with many: And there|fore I &s;hall examine the <HI>weight</HI> of it the more carefully, in this and the en&s;uing, di&s;cour&s;e: not doubting but it will ap|pear too light for their purpo&s;e. The doctrine of the go&s;pel undoubtedly is, that we are <HI>ju&s;tified by faith;</HI> but it is a great mi&s;take to infer from hence, that we are accepted to the divine favour, and entitled to eternal life, without unfeigned

repentance, and new obedience. What|ever notions we may entertain of <HI>ju&s;tifi|cation;</HI> it is &s;till evident that every unre|formed Sinner, every one who hears the word, and does it not, is the object of God's wrath; and cannot become an heir of eternal life, but by being <HI>made free from &s;in,</HI> and <HI>having his fruit unto holine&s;s.</HI> Peo|ple may amu&s;e them&s;elves with <HI>terms</HI> and <HI>di&s;tinctions,</HI> as long as they plea&s;e; and a&s;cribe their ju&s;tification to whatever they will: But after all, the &s;cripture is plain, that every wicked man is out of his Ma|ker's favour; and mu&s;t continue &s;o, till he cea&s;es to do evil, and learns to do well.</P>
<P>BUT in order to my &s;peaking with as little ambiguity as may be, upon the point before us; and to prevent mi&s;con&s;tructi|on; I would premi&s;e a few things con|cerning the nature of ju&s;tification. A &s;hort account hereof, will open the way for what is to follow, concerning the manner in which, and the terms upon which, we are ju&s;tified before God.</P>
<P>THAT which is intended by ju&s;tifica|tion in the new te&s;tament, may be better under&s;tood by a brief de&s;cription, than by any formal definition of the thing.</P>
<P>NOW evangelical ju&s;tification may be con&s;idered with relation to the Author of it; who is almighty God. For, &s;ays the
<PB N="173" REF="007488_0178_102B90C260D21598">
apo&s;tle, "It is God that ju&s;tifieth." And if we con&s;ider it under the notion of an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' we &s;ometimes &s;peak of ju&s;tification as an <HI>Act</HI> of God; yet it can hardly be conceived of as any thing really di&s;tinct from his written word, or the gracious promi&s;es and declarations of the go&s;pel. The terms upon which we are accepted to favour, pardoned and ju&s;tified, are already laid down in the holy Scriptures: So that tho&s;e who comply there|with, are ju&s;tified of cour&s;e, upon &s;uch compliance. The&s;e terms are &s;table and fixed; &s;o that every one who comes up thereto, is intitled to the mercy revealed; tho&s;e who do not, are &s;till under condemnation. There is nothing arbitary, or capricious, in the ju&s;tification of one, and the condemnation of another. But God ju&s;tifies one, and condemns another, by, and in his word; according as men do, or do not comply with his will there made known. No one is under condem|nation, but whom the word and law of God condemns; no one i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;tified, but whom the Go&s;pel ju&s;tifies. We do not, &s;urely, imagine that there is any &s;entence of ab&s;olution, or ju&s;tification, formally pronounced in heaven, when a man is ju&s;tified; tho' we &s;ometimes expre&s;s our&s;elves after this man|ner. No: God's &s;entence of ab&s;olution, or ju&s;tification, is in his revealed word; not any thing di&s;tinct from, or inde|pendent of, what he has there declared; but this is the very thing it&s;elf. There is no <HI>Act</HI> of ju&s;tification to be conceived of, either as prior, or &s;ub&s;equent to, or different from, the go&s;pel-declarations of mercy. In them it is that we have our pardon and ju&s;tification. God is to be con&s;idered as &s;peaking to us in his word, and as pronouncing the &s;entence which <HI>that</HI> pronounces, whether of pardon and life or condemna|tion and death: Which &s;entence will be ratified, be put into execution, and will fully take effect, in the judgment of the great day. To &s;ay a man is ju&s;tified, or that he is under con|demnation, expre&s;&s;es the relation in which he &s;tands to God's word and law: The former means, that he is One, to whom the gracious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel belong; the latter, that he is One, again&s;t whom a cur&s;e is denounced. It would pro|bably have prevented a great deal of confu&s;ion, and unintelli|gible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, upon the &s;ubject of ju&s;tification, had it always been con&s;idered in this light; as being only the &s;entence which God pa&s;&s;es on a man, in, and by his word; in&s;tead of being con|&s;idered as a divine <HI>act,</HI> intirely di&s;tinct from, and independent of, it.</NOTE> <HI>act</HI> of God; it is an act of his mer|cy,

grace and favour, in contradi&s;tinction from his ju&s;tice: For, &s;ays the &s;ame A|po&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> we are "ju&s;tified freely by his grace." The truth, and the ground, of which a&s;&s;ertion will appear, if we con|&s;ider ju&s;tification with regard to the &s;ub|ject of it; or who it is that is ju&s;tified; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law of God, or a &s;inner: For &s;ays St. <HI>Paul,</HI> "God ju&s;|tifieth the ungodly." All having &s;inned, ju&s;tification mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be of grace, entirely unmerited. God ju&s;tifies no per|&s;on under the notion of his being inno|cent, or perfectly righteous, whether <HI>in|herently</HI> or <HI>imputatively.</HI> Nor would the ju&s;tification of &s;uch a one, be an act of grace; it would be only an act of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider evangelical ju&s;tificati|on, with relation to the great Mediator; it is his purcha&s;e, the fruit and effect of his Death. In other words, He, by what he has done and &s;uffered for us, has laid the foundation for our being ju&s;tifi|ed; according to God's appointment, and the oeconomy of the go&s;pel. Ac|cordingly it &s;aid, that we are ju&s;tified by the grace of God, <HI>thro' the redemption that is in Chri&s;t, whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

LET us for the further illu&s;tration of the &s;cripture notion of ju&s;tification, con|&s;ider what benefits are implied therein; and what privileges accrue to the &s;ubjects of it. Now that which is primarily in|tended hereby is, pardon, impunity, or exemption from the puni&s;hment due to &s;in, according to the law of God. That this is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t proper notion of evangelical ju&s;tification, appears from the account and de&s;cription which the apo&s;tle gives of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 5,&mdash;"To him that&mdash;believeth on Him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s: Even as <HI>David</HI> al&s;o de&s;cribeth the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteou&s;ne&s;s without works; &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ed are they who&s;e i|niquities are forgiven, and who&s;e &s;ins are covered; ble&s;&s;ed is the man unto whom the Lord will not impute &s;in." From this pa&s;&s;age it is obvious, that to <HI>ju&s;tify,</HI> to <HI>impute righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> without works, to <HI>forgive iniquity,</HI> to <HI>cover &s;in,</HI> and <HI>not to im|pute &s;in,</HI> are expre&s;&s;ions nearly &s;ynonimous, &s;ignifying in general the very &s;ame thing, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the remi&s;&s;ion of the penalty denoun|ced again&s;t the violators of God's law: So that ju&s;tification is primarily, and mo&s;t properly oppo&s;ed to the marking and puni&s;hing of iniquity.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="007488_0181_102B90C8AB49F090">
HOWEVER this is not the whole of what is implied in evangelical ju&s;tificati|on. It is not a mere negative; but in|volves in it, po&s;itive ble&s;&s;ings, and glori|ous privileges. For example; he that is ju&s;tified, becomes, at the &s;ame time, an object of God's peculiar love; and, from a &s;tate of enmity, comes into a &s;tate of peace and reconciliation with Him. Thus the apo&s;tle tells us, that "being ju&s;tified&mdash;we have <HI>peace</HI> with God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And the per&s;on thus ju&s;tified is, according to the gracious promi&s;es and declarations of the go&s;pel, entitled both to God's peculiar care and guardian&s;hip in this world, and to glory in the other. He is accounted innocent and righteous, when ab&s;olved from his &s;ins, in his Ju&s;tification; and acquires thereby a right to happine&s;s, as tho' he had never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. There is not on|ly <HI>no condemnation belonging to him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8 1.</NOTE>; but he has, by virtue of God's gracious pro|mi&s;e, <HI>a right to the tree of life; and to enter in thro' the gates into the city.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">2. 14</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS, in brief, is the &s;cripture notion and idea of ju&s;tification. Perhaps the term may be &s;ometimes u&s;ed in the new te&s;tament, in a more lax, vague, and in|determinate &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to be applicable, as holine&s;s is, to the whole collective body
<PB N="177" REF="007488_0182_102B90CAF7AEAB50">
of profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians. But whether it is ever thus u&s;ed, or not, is not mate|rial to the point in hand. For we are now &s;peaking only of &s;uch a ju&s;tification, as implies in it the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, the &s;pecial favour and friend&s;hip of Heaven, and a &s;ure title to eternal happine&s;s; and con&s;equently &s;uch a one, as is peculiar to &s;ome, not common to all, who profe&s;s the religion of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>AND the que&s;tion now before us is, How this ju&s;tification accrues to us? What terms and conditions tho&s;e are, up|on which it is offered, and granted, to &s;inners? Whether we are, in this &s;en&s;e, ju&s;tified only by faith, or believing, as faith is di&s;tingui&s;hed from repentance, and newne&s;s of life? Or by faith, con&s;idered in a larger &s;en&s;e, and as virtually com|prehending &s;uch repentance, and new o|bedience. It is acknowledged upon all hands, that many even of tho&s;e who hear the glad tydings of the go&s;pel, and have taken upon them&s;elves the Chri&s;tian name and character, are not the &s;ubjects of this ju&s;tification. Many of them are, doubtle&s;s, as truly under condemnation, and as much the heirs of wrath, as if God had never revealed pardon and mer|cy to a &s;inful world. To what, then, is this di&s;tinction owing? In general it
<PB N="178" REF="007488_0183_102B90CC89CFDF10">
mu&s;t be owing to this, that &s;ome com|ply with the terms, on which their ju&s;ti|fication is &s;u&s;pended, while others reject them: for the terms are the &s;ame to all. God does not act the part of a Sovereign here, in ju&s;tifying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man, and leaving another under condemnation. Tho' we have no right to pre&s;cribe rules of con|duct to Him; he has pre&s;cribed them to Him&s;elf; and according to them he in|variably di&s;pen&s;es the ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant, without <HI>re&s;pect of per&s;ons</HI>&mdash;Now that God has &s;u&s;pended the ju&s;tifi|cation of &s;inners, not upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith only, in the re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, mentioned above; but upon faith, con&s;idered as comprehen|&s;ive of repentance from dead works, and of evangelical obedience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When evangelical obedience is &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to evangelical ju&s;tification; the meaning is not, that we mu&s;t actually perform a great number of good works, &s;uch as the go&s;pel requires, before we can be ju&s;tified. True repen|tance includes in it the principle of obedience; &s;o that every &s;incere penitent, is a good man, in the qualified &s;en&s;e of &s;crip|ture, even before he <HI>brings forth fruits meet for repentance:</HI> And he is no &s;ooner &s;uch, than he is pardoned and ju&s;tified. It is not imagined, that after his heart is really turned from &s;in to God, his ju&s;tification is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;pended upon his making this manife&s;t by his good works; or by a cour&s;e of external o|bedience to the laws of Chri&s;t: Which notion involves tho&s;e who embrace it, in many difficulties. Perhaps a per&s;on who believes the go&s;pel, and is become a &s;incere convert in his heart, being <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works,</HI> may be taken out of the world before he has &s;cope and opportuni|ty given him, to exerci&s;e the good principle he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, in an obedient life. Shall we &s;ay then, that &s;uch a man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not ju&s;tified, becau&s;e he has performed no works of go&s;pel obedi|ence? By no means. His repentance, and inward &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the terms of the go&s;pel, virtually contain all the good works which the go&s;pel requires. In the &s;ight of God, who know|eth the hearts of men, he had complied with the terms of mercy and &s;alvation, according to their true intent and mean|ing, altho' this was not manife&s;ted by his outward conduct. His willing and obedient heart, placed him in the cla&s;s of tho&s;e, to whom the go&s;pel offers mercy and &s;alvation, tho' he died before he had time, out of this <HI>good trea&s;ure, to bring forth good things.</HI> And altho' he had lived ever &s;o long after his being thus renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind; yet it is e|vident that he would have been ju&s;tified from that very time; and antecedently to his doing good works in the &s;en&s;e of the go&s;pel. The promi&s;es being made to &s;uch a <HI>temper,</HI> it is un|rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that his ju&s;tification would have been &s;u&s;pended upon the actual performance of tho&s;e works of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which naturally flow therefrom, whenever there is opportunity for it. Be&s;ides; if the actual performance of good works, is nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tification; it may rea&s;onably be inquired, how many good works are nece&s;&s;ary to that end? and how long a Man mu&s;t live, after he is inwardly convert|ed to God, in order to yield &s;uch an outward obedience to his commandments, without which he cannot be ju&s;tified? The&s;e que&s;tions, for the &s;ub&s;tance of them, have often been a&s;ked; but never an&s;wered to the &s;atisfaction of impartial, un|prejudiced men. They are, indeed, unan&s;werable; and the bare propo&s;ing of them, is &s;ufficient to &s;how, that They go upon a wrong hypothe&s;is, who &s;uppo&s;e that any acts of exter|nal obedience are the ground of our ju&s;tification, or nece&s;&s;ary in order there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> That obedience to the go&s;pel, to which the promi&s;es of forgivene&s;s and eternal life are made, is an hearty belief, and inward &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the terms, of it; &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion thereto, at will, whenever there is opportunity and &s;cope for it, be accompanied with a corre&s;ponding obedi|ence of life. And this is all the obedience, for the nece&s;&s;ity of which, in order to ju&s;tification. I argue in this, and the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome, who a&s;cribe our ju&s;tificati|on to faith alone, may comprehend under the term faith, all that godly &s;orrow, and internal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the terms of the go&s;pel, which others intend when they a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience, and deny the &s;ufficiency of faith to ju&s;tify. In this ca&s;e, there is indeed a contradiction in words, but the real &s;en&s;e of the parties is the &s;ame.</NOTE>; I &s;hall en|deavour to make manife&s;t by &s;everal ar|guments.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="007488_0184_102B90CF18C4BE78">
BUT there is a vulgar prejudice, which I would beg leave briefly to obviate, here. Tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of evan|gelical obedience in order to ju&s;tification,
<PB N="180" REF="007488_0185_102B90D0A1F9C8D0">
are often accu&s;ed of holding, that good works are meritorious; and accordingly they are ranked with the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in this re&s;pect. Than which conduct of their adver&s;aries, there cannot well be a|ny thing more invidious, di&s;ingenuous and abu&s;ive. We con&s;tantly di&s;claim the doctrine of merit. We a&s;&s;ert that Chri&s;t, by what he has done and &s;uffered, has procured mercy, ju&s;tification, and eter|nal life for us: Altho' we think that we cannot be ju&s;tified, according to the te|nor of the new covenant, but by faith in, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer. And even after we have obeyed the go&s;|pel, we account it great grace in God to accept us, and to be&s;tow eternal Life up|on us. Is this to teach that obedience and good works merit ju&s;tification! Let us &s;ee how ea&s;ily this charge might be retorted upon tho&s;e that bring it. Faith, or believing, is as much <HI>our act,</HI> &s;ome|thing

Their faith is put into, and holds, the &s;ame place in this affair of ju&s;tificati|on, with our obedience to the go&s;pel. How meritorious with them, is that &s;in|gle act of obedience, <HI>believing in Him whom God hath &s;ent!</HI> No; they will doubtle&s;s tell us, that they do not con&s;i|der faith as what merits ju&s;tification; but only &s;uppo&s;e, that, according to the go&s;|pel covenant of grace, the ju&s;tification which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, is annexed to believing; that they are ju&s;tified up|on account of what He has done and &s;uffered, not upon account of the inhe|rent worth and merit of faith. Very well: This &s;ufficiently vindicates them from the imputation of making that one act, <HI>believing,</HI> meritorious of ju&s;tification and eternal life. And in the &s;ame way do we clear our&s;elves of the charge of making <HI>obedience</HI> to the go&s;pel, meritori|ous. It is only &s;ub&s;tituting the word o|bedience in the room of &s;aith, thus: <Q>We do not con&s;ider obedience as what me|rits

We are ju&s;tified upon account of what He has done and &s;uffered for us; not upon account of the inherent worth and merit of our obedience.</Q></P>
<P>PUTTING the matter in this light, and thus turning the tables, does, I think, &s;how, that we are as far from making o|bedience in general, meritorious, as they who tax us therewith, are from making their faith &s;o. For to that faith, to that one act of obedience, they a&s;cribe all the efficacy in the matter of ju&s;tification, which we a&s;cribe to faith and obedience conjunctly. And altho', in &s;ome of them, the bringing of &s;uch an invidious charge again&s;t their brethren, may be charitably imputed to ignorance; yet, in others, it is but too evident that it proceeds from &s;omething el&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>HAVING thus premi&s;ed what &s;eemed to be needful, I proceed now more di|rectly to what was intended; <HI>namely,</HI> to &s;how, That ju&s;tification, in that &s;en&s;e of the term, which has been explained a|bove, accrues to &s;inners, not by faith con|&s;idered exclu&s;ively of, and in di&s;tinction from, repentance and evangelical obedi|ence;

<PB N="184" REF="007488_0189_102B90D881D7E4B0">
&s;uch a con&s;truction upon them, they be|ing fairly capable of another. It will not be expected that I &s;hould con&s;ider all the pa&s;&s;ages here referred to: I &s;hall therefore &s;elect only a few of the principal of them; tho&s;e upon which the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s has been laid; which are in the epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> And if a fair and natural ac|count can be given of them, without re|curring to the <HI>&s;olifidian</HI> doctrine, this will be a clue to the under&s;tanding of all o|thers, either exactly parallel, or &s;imilar, to them.</P>
<P>WE may begin with that of the Apo&s;|tle in his epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans: There|fore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law.</HI> [Chap. 3. ver. 28.] Are not faith and obedience here di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other? And is not ju&s;tification expre&s;ly attributed to the former, exclu&s;ively of the latter? I an&s;wer, that by <HI>the law</HI> is often intended the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, the law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and by <HI>faith,</HI> the di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And if we under&s;tand the terms thus in this place, the &s;uppo&s;ed difficulty intirely vani&s;hes. For then the meaning of the apo&s;tle will be no more than this, That a man is ju&s;tified by the go&s;pel, or in the method of the go&s;pel, even without ob&s;erving the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and
<PB N="185" REF="007488_0190_102B90DAB0EB4120">
whether he be <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> cannot be ju&s;tified by <HI>the law,</HI> which they have violated; but mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to Chri&s;t, who is the end thereof for ju&s;tification: And the <HI>Gentiles</HI> may, in this way, attain to ju&s;tification altoge|ther without the law. So that both of them are upon one and the &s;ame footing, with relation to the divine acceptance. It is the go&s;pel of God's grace alone, which can ju&s;tify either of them; and in this method, one may be ju&s;tified as well as the other. Now as <HI>the law,</HI> and <HI>faith,</HI> meaning thereby the <HI>mo&s;aic,</HI> and the e|vangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, are frequently oppo&s;ed the one to the other in this man|ner, this interpretation is not unnatural; and indeed it is favoured by what imme|diately follows,&mdash;<HI>Is he the God of the Jews only? is be not al&s;o of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles al&s;o. Seeing it is one God, which &s;hall ju&s;tify the circumci&s;ion by faith, and the uncircumci&s;ion thro' faith.</HI></P>
<P>THE proceeding context al&s;o favours this interpretation. The Apo&s;tle had been &s;howing at large, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of nature; and the <HI>Jews,</HI> the revealed law of God, the law given by <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> From whence he con|cludes, [<HI>ver.</HI> 19 and 20] that all the world, <HI>Jews</HI> as well as <HI>Gentiles,</HI> were
<PB N="186" REF="007488_0191_102B90DC936D3888">
become <HI>guilty before God;</HI> and &s;o could not plead a legal righteou&s;ne&s;s for ju&s;tifi|cation. In the three following ver&s;es St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of that gracious provi&s;ion, which God had made in the go&s;pel, for all &s;inners in common, whether under the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> law, or the law of nature; <HI>for there is no difference.</HI> By faith, by the go&s;pel, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion thereto, all &s;inners may at|tain to ju&s;tification. The three next ver|&s;es contain a more particular account of the method in which this ju&s;tification ac|crues to &s;inners; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by <HI>the grace of God, thro' the redemption that is in Chri&s;t; whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation,</HI> &amp;c. In the next ver&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI> triumphs over the boa&s;ting, &s;elf-righteous <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e dependence, for ju&s;tification, was not upon the Mercy of God in Chri&s;t, but upon their legal works,&mdash;<HI>Where is boa&s;ting then,</HI> &s;ays he? <HI>It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, what becomes then of that glorying, to which the <HI>Jews</HI> are &s;o much addicted? It is entirely pre|cluded; and the very foundation of it de&s;troyed. How is this done? by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es?</HI> No: but all boa&s;ting is effectually excluded by the law of faith; by the evangelical method of ju&s;tification; which &s;uppo&s;es that the &s;ubjects of it are
<PB N="187" REF="007488_0192_102B90DE6EC2FE38">
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; and which mu&s;t therefore be of grace. The words which I pro|po&s;ed to explain, immediately follow; and they are an inference drawn from what had been &s;aid above; or rather the &s;um of it, expre&s;&s;ed in a few words&mdash;<HI>Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, Since therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> have &s;inned as well as the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> &s;ince <HI>every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped;</HI> and all men be condemned, by law; and &s;ince God has revealed a gracious method of accep|tance with him by Chri&s;t, making no difference betwixt <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> &s;ince the&s;e things are &s;o, we may be a&s;|&s;ured, that how much &s;oever the <HI>Jews</HI> may boa&s;t of their <HI>own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law,</HI> and de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> yet they neither are, nor can be ju&s;tified, by their obedience to the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (it being imperfect) but mu&s;t have re|cour&s;e to the law of faith, to the Go&s;pel of God's grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: And in this way, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> may attain to ju&s;|tification as well as they; even tho' they do not ob&s;erve the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> nor have any thing to do with it.</P>
<P>NOW &s;uppo&s;ing this to be the true, as it is not an unnatural, interpretation of the pa&s;&s;age; it makes nothing in favour
<PB N="188" REF="007488_0193_102B90E04E9F8BA8">
of the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, in the <HI>modern &s;en&s;e</HI> of the term <HI>faith;</HI> or as faith is oppo&s;ed to evangelical obedi|ence. The amount of it is only this, that ju&s;tification cannot come by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> but only by a compliance with the go&s;pel; by believing it, and heartily &s;ubmitting to it.</P>
<P>BUT it has been ob&s;erved, that the a|po&s;tle here &s;peaks of the <HI>deeds</HI> OF LAW, without the <HI>article:</HI> From whence &s;ome have argued, that he does not mean par|ticularly the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation; but law in general, law ab&s;olutely taken: And if &s;o, it is &s;aid, that faith is here oppo&s;ed no le&s;s to evangelical works, than to the deeds of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law: And con&s;e|quently, that believing ju&s;tifies us, exclu|&s;ively of obedience of any kind.</P>
<P>NOW tho' the <HI>Article</HI> is both u&s;ed and omitted in the new-te&s;tament, in &s;uch a manner, that no &s;tre&s;s can be laid upon a critici&s;m of this &s;ort; yet I will not con|tend about that point here. We will, if you plea&s;e, take if for granted, that, by <HI>law,</HI> the Apo&s;tle intends not particularly the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation; but law in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute, unlimited &s;en&s;e. Let us &s;ee to what his words will amount upon this &s;uppo&s;ition. And I think they will come nearly to the &s;ame thing, as to the
<PB N="189" REF="007488_0194_102B90E275D069B8">
particular point now before us. For then St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s &s;en&s;e will be this: That all men having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law they were re&s;pectively under; the <HI>Jews,</HI> the revealed law of God, and the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the law of nature; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould attain to ju&s;tification in a way &s;trictly legal. For in order to ju&s;tificati|on by the <HI>deeds of law,</HI> of any law what|ever, it is nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e deeds &s;hould be exactly conformable to that law. And no mans deeds having been thus conformable to law, it is impo&s;&s;ible that either <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> that any man whatever, &s;hould be ju&s;tified in that way. It is nece&s;&s;ary that grace and mercy in|tervene, in order to the ju&s;tification of a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or. But tho' we are not ju&s;ti|fied by the deeds of law, in the &s;en&s;e a|bove expre&s;&s;ed; it does not follow that we are ju&s;tified by faith or believing <HI>only,</HI> as faith is di&s;tingui&s;hed from repentance and newne&s;s of life. Nor is there any nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing that the apo&s;tle here u&s;es the term faith in that re&s;trained &s;en&s;e. Altho' we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that faith is here u&s;ed as comprehen&s;ive of evangelical o|bedience, when we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tifi|ed thereby; this would not be incon&s;i&s;t|ent with what is immediately added,&mdash;<HI>without the deeds of law.</HI> There is no con|tradiction
<PB N="190" REF="007488_0195_102B90E45A5B7B78">
in &s;aying that we are ju&s;tified by faith, including &s;ubjection and obedi|ence to Chri&s;t in our idea of faith; and &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, that we are not ju&s;tified by the <HI>deeds of law:</HI> For the lat|ter is only &s;aying, in other words, that we are not ju&s;tified by a perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s; or by works exactly conformable to law. In &s;hort, tho' faith is here op|po&s;ed to the <HI>deeds of law,</HI> it is not oppo&s;|ed to repentance, and evangelical holi|ne&s;s; but only to &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s as would ju&s;tify a man in the eye and &s;en&s;e of law; and &s;o be incon&s;i&s;tent with grace in the Law-giver.</P>
<P>WHETHER, therefore, the Apo&s;tle is &s;peaking only of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or of law in the mo&s;t unlimited, ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e; it comes exactly to the &s;ame thing, as to the point now in que&s;tion. Upon nei|ther of the &s;uppo&s;itions is there any need of under&s;tanding him as oppo&s;ing faith, to the obedience of faith, or to go&s;pel holine&s;s; but only to the deeds of law, in <HI>that &s;en&s;e</HI> wherein he u&s;es the&s;e terms: Which &s;en&s;e is manife&s;tly this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> works exactly corre&s;ponding to the demands of law, whether that of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or that of <HI>nature.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e, it is indeed evident, that no man is ju&s;tified by the deeds of law; becau&s;e, as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>all
<PB N="191" REF="007488_0196_102B90E642D85CF0">
have &s;inned.</HI> But it may be &s;till true that we are ju&s;tified by our obedience to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT I will go one &s;tep further here, by way of conce&s;&s;ion; and allow, for the pre&s;ent, that the Apo&s;tle oppo&s;es faith, not only to a <HI>legal righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but even to all <HI>external acts</HI> of <HI>evangelical obedience.</HI> And even this &s;uppo&s;ition will not mili|tate in the lea&s;t degree, again&s;t any thing I have &s;aid; or favour the common <HI>&s;olifidian</HI> doctrine. Acts of external obe|dience, or good works, mo&s;t properly &s;o called, are &s;uch as proceed from an obe|dient and good heart; from a righteous principle within. It is the <HI>good tree</HI> only, that bringeth forth <HI>good fruit;</HI> and it is only a <HI>good man,</HI> out of the <HI>good trea&s;ure in his heart,</HI> that bringeth forth <HI>good things.</HI> An holy principle within, is con&s;idered in &s;cripture as <HI>prior</HI> to good works; the latter being the exertions and operations of the former. And, as was &s;aid in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e, a man is ju&s;tified in the &s;en&s;e of the go&s;pel, and in the &s;ight of God, <HI>a&s;&s;oon</HI> as he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this good principle; and, therefore, <HI>antecedently</HI> to his doing any of tho&s;e good works, which flow from it: Yea, he is ju&s;tified, tho' he &s;hould not live to per|form any good works at all. So that it
<PB N="192" REF="007488_0197_102B90E82071DCC8">
may be allowed, con&s;i&s;tently enough with what has been &s;aid, that the apo&s;tle here oppo&s;es faith, to all <HI>external acts</HI> of o|bedience in general; whether of o|bedience to law, or to the go&s;pel. But yet it will not follow, that he oppo&s;es it to a principle of goodne&s;s and holine&s;s in the heart; the nece&s;&s;ity of which princi|ple, in order to our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, is all that I am arguing for. Tho' this principle, wherever it is, will be actually, and always, productive of an obedient life, provided there is time and &s;cope given for it to exert it&s;elf. So that none can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thereof, ex|cepting tho&s;e, who&s;e external conduct is agreeable to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;According to this la&s;t explanation of the apo&s;tle's words, faith is con&s;idered as <HI>virtually</HI> and <HI>radically,</HI> containing evan|gelical obedience; not as &s;omething di&s;|tinct from it: And therefore St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not here teach the doctrine of ju&s;ti|fication by faith, <HI>in the modern &s;en&s;e;</HI> but the contrary.</P>
<P>IT appears, if I mi&s;take not, from what has been &s;aid above, that there is no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of under&s;tanding the apo&s;tle, in this place as oppo&s;ing faith to obedi|ence, in the way that many interpret him; or as a&s;&s;erting that we are ju&s;tified
<PB N="193" REF="007488_0198_102B90EA061D9510">
by faith exclu&s;ively of obedience. His words will fairly admit of a different &s;en&s;e; which is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE next pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall con&s;ider, wherein faith and obedience may &s;eem to be oppo&s;ed to each other, is <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 31, <HI>&amp;c.&mdash;But I&s;rael which followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath not attained to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s? Wherefore? Be|cau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith; but as it were by the works of the law.</HI> This pa&s;&s;age coincides &s;o nearly, in &s;en&s;e and de&s;ign, with that which we have been con&s;ider|ing, that the le&s;s needs to be &s;aid upon it. By <HI>I&s;rael's following after the law of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is intended the <HI>Jews</HI> endeavour|ing to work out, or to perform, &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s, as would, of it&s;elf and in its own nature, be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify them in the &s;ight of God. They hoped to be ju&s;tified merely by a &s;trict adherence to, and ob&s;ervation of the law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> However, in the language of the apo&s;tle, they did not <HI>attain to the law of righteou&s;|ne&s;s: i. e.</HI> they did not attain to that ju&s;|tification unto life, which they were in pur&s;uit of; but failed in the attempt. <HI>Wherefore?</HI> How does it come to pa&s;s, that they did not attain to ju&s;tification? This que&s;tion the apo&s;tle an&s;wers in the
<PB N="194" REF="007488_0199_102B90EC6FB14E08">
next words. It was becau&s;e they &s;ought to be ju&s;tified in an improper manner; in a way wherein it is impo&s;&s;ible that a|ny &s;hould be ju&s;tified; neglecting that method which God had pointed out. It was <HI>becau&s;e they &s;ought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law:</HI> or, by <HI>works of law;</HI> (for the <HI>article</HI> is here o|mitted.) The plain meaning is, that the generality of the <HI>Jews</HI> of this corrupt age, had rejected the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ub|mitting to him, and &s;eeking ju&s;tification and eternal life, by him: They imagin|ed, that they were to be ju&s;tified merely by obedience to law; and that they &s;tood in no need of the grace of the go&s;pel. For which rea&s;on, they did not attain to ju&s;tification; it being impo&s;&s;ible that ju&s;ti|fication &s;hould come by law, unle&s;s where there is a <HI>perfect</HI> conformity thereto. It is manife&s;t, that law, not tempered and relaxed by grace, mu&s;t condemn all tho&s;e that fall &s;hort of the perfection required by it. So that the <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e &s;ole de|pendence was upon their own legal righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, could not, in the nature of the thing, be ju&s;tified in this way. Whereas <HI>the Gentiles</HI> (as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the preceeding ver&s;e) <HI>which followed not after righteou&s;ne&s;s, attained to righteou&s;ne&s;s, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of faith: i. e.</HI> The

<HI>Gentiles,</HI> who did not pretend to work out &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s as would entitle them to ju&s;tification in the eye of law; obtained ju&s;tification notwith&s;tanding; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that, ju&s;tification which God has re|vealed in the go&s;pel, thro' faith.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;urely no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;up|po&s;ing that faith and evangelical obedi|ence are here oppo&s;ed to each other; as if righteou&s;ne&s;s, or <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> came by the former, and not by the latter. Faith is only oppo&s;ed to an imaginary, legal righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;uch a one as the <HI>Jews</HI> tru&s;ted to, de&s;pi&s;ing and rejecting the grace of the go&s;pel. And this pa&s;&s;age will receive farther illu&s;tration from ano|ther, in the 10th Chap. of the &s;ame epi&s;|tle, ver. 3 and 4. The apo&s;tle &s;ays, that the <HI>Jews, being ignorant of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God For Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s to every one that believeth.</HI> The &s;en&s;e is:&mdash;Altho' the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation was never de&s;igned for a law, in the exact ob&s;ervation of which, the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be accepted and ju&s;tified of God; but had a typical reference to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> thro' whom, in a way of grace, ju&s;tification comes; yet the <HI>Jews</HI> being ignorant of
<PB N="196" REF="007488_0201_102B90F0472D47C0">
this method of ju&s;tification thro' grace, which God has ordained for &s;inners; having perverted the law, which had <HI>a &s;hadow of good things to come,</HI> from its ori|ginal meaning and true de&s;ign; and vain|ly attempting to work out &s;uch a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as would render the intervening of grace needle&s;s; &s;uch a one, as might give them a title to ju&s;tification upon the footing of mere law; the <HI>Jews</HI> having thus mi&s;taken the matter, have not &s;ub|mitted to, but oppo&s;ed, that method of ju&s;tification which God has ordained and revealed, thro' faith. For Chri&s;t is typi|fied and prefigured in the law it&s;elf, as the end of it, for ju&s;tification, to all tho&s;e who believe in, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to Him.&mdash;Is there any nece&s;&s;ity of &s;up|po&s;ing that the apo&s;tle here oppo&s;es be|lieving in Chri&s;t, to obeying his go&s;pel? It is plain, that he oppo&s;es believing, on|ly to the conduct of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who went about <HI>to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> i. e. who expected to be ju&s;tified upon the footing of mere law; not being &s;en|&s;ible that they fell &s;o &s;hort of the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s required therein, as to &s;tand in need of the grace of the Go&s;pel; and who, therefore, rejected the promi&s;ed Saviour. This pa&s;&s;age is, I think, ex|actly parallel to that, con&s;idered above.

And in both of them, the term <HI>faith</HI> is u|&s;ed in a complex &s;en&s;e, for believing in Chri&s;t, and &s;incerely obeying his go&s;pel; not in the re&s;trained &s;en&s;e of &s;ome <HI>modern</HI> divines; as if our ju&s;tification were &s;u&s;|pended on the former, exclu&s;ively of the latter: For which notion there is no foun|dation in the new-te&s;tament.</P>

this foundation that he &s;ays, our &s;alvati|on is of grace?

<P>1&s;t. THAT the apo&s;tle is not here &s;peaking particularly concerning our ju&s;|tification; but concerning our &s;alvation in general: "By grace are ye <HI>&s;aved.</HI>"</P>
<P>2dly. EVEN tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the doc|trine of ju&s;tification by faith only, in op|po&s;ition to evangelical obedience, gene|rally hold the nece&s;&s;ity of works, or obe|dience, in order to &s;alvation: (a di&s;tincti|on, the vanity of which will be &s;hown in the next di&s;cour&s;e) So that, this pa&s;&s;age either proves nothing to their purpo&s;e; or it proves too much; and more than they are willing to allow, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we are not only ju&s;tified, but &s;aved, with|out works.</P>

faith al&s;o: For believing is our own act; and expre&s;ly called a <HI>work,</HI> by our Saviour, as has been ob&s;erved before. Whereas St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, on the contrary, that we are <HI>&s;aved by grace thro' faith.</HI> I would, if po&s;&s;ible, expre&s;s what I here intend, &s;o us not to be mi&s;under&s;tood. It is &s;aid by &s;ome, that if our ju&s;tification and acceptance with God, depended up|on our obeying the Go&s;pel; upon any thing we do, be it what it will; then we &s;hould be ju&s;tified, not by grace, but by <HI>works;</HI> and con&s;equently there would be room left for <HI>boa&s;ting,</HI> which is not to be allowed. Well then, believing in Chri&s;t is our own act; it is our work, tho' not done without the divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance. E|ven this, mu&s;t therefore be excluded, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent argument, le&s;t &s;ome ground of boa&s;ting &s;hould remain. Faith is as much excluded, by the pre&s;ent ar|gument, from having any hand in our ju&s;tification, as obedience in any other re&s;pect.

<P>4thly. ALL occa&s;ion of boa&s;ting &s;eems to be taken away, if we exclude works from being any meritorious cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification and &s;alvation; even tho' they are not excluded from being the conditi|on of it. If we acknowledge our obedi|ence is very imperfect, &s;o that we cannot be ju&s;tified upon the footing of mere law; if we acknowledge, that we cannot claim Salvation as our due, by virtue of any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done; if we acknowledge our&s;elves in|debted for it to the grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this, &s;urely, leaves no room for boa&s;ting; tho' we may &s;till very con&s;i&s;|tently hold, that our ju&s;tification is &s;u&s;|pended upon our hearty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t, and &s;incere obedience to his com|mandments. The a&s;&s;erting of this is not contradicting what the apo&s;tle &s;ays, that we are not &s;aved by <HI>works;</HI> but perfectly con&s;i&s;tent therewith. He intends no more, than that we are not &s;aved upon the footing of mere law; by &s;uch works as would exclude grace; and leave room for boa&s;ting. And his meaning, I hum|bly conceive, might be expre&s;&s;ed thus,
<PB N="201" REF="007488_0206_102B90FA29E6CE80">
more at large. "Take heed, that ye do not exalt your&s;elves, or over-rate your own works, to the di&s;honoring and &s;ub|verting of the grace of God: For it is by His grace and free bounty, that you are &s;aved; not in the way of obedience to law, con&s;idered as a covenant of works; but in the way of faith, which is reveal|ed thro' Chri&s;t, to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of Law. You are not &s;aved by works, or by a legal obedience; or on account of the intrin&s;ick value and merit of any thing you do. You have not obeyed a|ny law of works &s;o perfectly, that &s;alva|tion becomes your due. And of this I admoni&s;h you, le&s;t any man &s;hould proud|ly boa&s;t; or think more highly of him|&s;elf and his works than he ought to do, to the di&s;honor of divine grace."</P>
<P>THIS appears to me to be the true &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle. And if it is, the pa&s;&s;age does not favour the doctrine of ju&s;tifica|tion by faith alone, in the <HI>modern &s;en&s;e</HI> of the terms: But is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the contrary &s;cheme; wherein obe|dience to the go&s;pel is &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary in order to our acceptance with God. There is a wide difference betwixt &s;aying, that we are ju&s;tified and &s;aved by works, merely upon the footing of law; (which is what the Apo&s;tle denies) and &s;aying,
<PB N="202" REF="007488_0207_102B90FC138F4F18">
that we are ju&s;tified and &s;aved, by believing in, and &s;ubmitting to Him that was <HI>the End of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and who has redeemed us from the cur&s;e thereof: (Which is what he denies not.) The former is, indeed, to &s;ubvert the grace of the go&s;pel, and to leave room for boa&s;t|ing; the latter does neither; but duly exalts the grace of God; and leads us to <HI>think &s;oberly of our&s;elves, as we ought to think.</HI></P>
<P>IT is hoped, that what has been &s;aid upon the&s;e &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the illu&s;|tration of others, which &s;peak of our be|ing ju&s;tified by faith, and not by works. Tho' I do not pretend, as yet, to have proved any thing more, than that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages do not e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine which they are commonly alledged in &s;upport of. And this, certainly, they do not; becau&s;e they fairly admit of another con&s;truction, than that which is put up|on them.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES I. 21, 22.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>LAY apart all filthine&s;s and &s;uperfluity of naughtine&s;s, and receive with meekne&s;s the ingrafted word, which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own &s;elves.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a very obvious inference from this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, That in order to the Salvation of our Souls, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be <HI>doers of the word,</HI> as well as <HI>hearers</HI> and believers of it; and that they who expect to be &s;aved upon any other terms, delude, and impo&s;e upon, them&s;elves. However, there is great rea&s;on to fear, that many per&s;ons do actually thus <HI>deceive their own &s;elves,</HI> in a matter of the la&s;t importance; fondly imagining, from what
<PB N="205" REF="007488_0210_102B9101BA5FD900">
the &s;cripture &s;ays concerning our being <HI>&s;aved by grace;</HI> being <HI>found in Chri&s;t, not having our own righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and being <HI>ju&s;tified by faith;</HI> that obedience to the go&s;pel, is not an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of our obtaining eternal life. I have therefore, in &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es, been en|deavouring to <HI>undeceive</HI> tho&s;e, who may have thus <HI>deceived them&s;elves;</HI> and to guard others again&s;t the like fatal de|lu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN my la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, I entered upon a con&s;ideration of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture, wherein our ju&s;tification with God, is &s;aid to be <HI>by faith;</HI> by faith <HI>without works; without the deeds of law,</HI> and the like. From whence many have conclud|ed, that obedience to the Go&s;pel was not nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified; but that faith alone, (in the <HI>modern</HI> re|&s;trained &s;en&s;e of the term, as it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from repentance and newne&s;s of life) is available thereto. It has been &s;hown that there is no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of under|&s;tanding the pa&s;&s;ages intended, in this &s;en&s;e; and that a fair and intelligible ac|count may be given of them, without having recour&s;e to the modern <HI>&s;olifidian</HI> doctrine. There is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing, that when the apo&s;tles oppo&s;e faith and works to each other, a&s;&s;erting that we
<PB N="206" REF="007488_0211_102B9103EFE3E340">
are ju&s;tified by the former exclu&s;ively of the latter, they intended to oppo&s;e faith, to repentance and evangelical obedience. No more <HI>may</HI> be intended by the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions, than that we are not ju&s;tified upon the footing of mere law; but by the grace of God revealed in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed now, as was propo&s;ed in the SECOND Place, to &s;how, That the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which &s;peak of our being <HI>ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of law,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cannot po&s;&s;ibly</HI> mean, That we are ju&s;tified by faith, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from re|pentance and new obedience, in any to|lerable con&s;i&s;tency with the general doc|trine of &s;cripture: And that it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the term faith, in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, in a larger &s;en&s;e; as comprehending repentance and evan|gelical obedience in it; not as contradi&s;|tingui&s;hed therefrom.</P>
<P>To make which point evident, I mu&s;t ju&s;t remind you of what was &s;aid, in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the &s;crip|ture-notion of ju&s;tification, and the ble&s;|&s;ings and privileges included in it, as it re|&s;pects us, &s;inful creatures. Ju&s;tification, as was there premi&s;ed, involves in it, the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, the acceptance of our per&s;ons to the favour and friend&s;hip of God, and a title to eternal life in the
<PB N="207" REF="007488_0212_102B9105D270EAB0">
kingdom of heaven. This is the idea which the holy &s;criptures give us of ju&s;ti|fication.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Vid. Serm. 7. page 172, 173, 174.</NOTE> And I de&s;ire that this may be kept in mind; otherwi&s;e the en&s;uing di&s;|cour&s;e will not be fully under&s;tood.</P>
<P>NOW, That <HI>faith,</HI> when we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified thereby, <HI>without the deeds of law,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cannot</HI> mean faith, exclu&s;ively of repentance and obedience; but <HI>mu&s;t</HI> intend faith, con&s;idered as the principle of evangelical holine&s;s, and as virtually comprehending it, will appear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I. WHATSOEVER is nece&s;&s;ary in or|der to the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, is al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to ju&s;tification; becau&s;e the pardon of &s;in is a principal part of our ju&s;tification. It is a manife&s;t re|pugnancy to &s;ay, that we can be ju&s;ti|fied without that which is nece&s;&s;ary to our forgivene&s;s, if forgivene&s;s is includ|ed in the idea of ju&s;tification. This would be, in effect, to &s;ay, that we are ju&s;tified without, and independently of, that upon which our ju&s;tification is &s;u&s;|pended. Since ju&s;tification before God, involves in it the pa&s;&s;ing by our offen|ces, we cannot, certainly, become the &s;ubjects of it, till we have complied with tho&s;e terms, on which God has expre&s;ly made our forgivene&s;s with him to depend.
<PB N="208" REF="007488_0213_102B910807F18DD8">
And if we look into the new-te&s;tament, we &s;hall find, that God has &s;u&s;pended our forgivene&s;s with him, upon our for|giving tho&s;e that have injured us. "If ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, &s;ays our Saviour, your heavenly Father will al&s;o forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es: But if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." Since then, the forgiving of our neigh|bour is nece&s;&s;ary to our forgivene&s;s; it mu&s;t be equally nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;tification; unle&s;s any will &s;ay, that we may be ju&s;tified without being for|given: i. e. in effect, be pardoned with|out being pardoned. For it really comes to this, if pardon is included in ju&s;tifica|tion, and an e&s;&s;ential part of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That ju&s;tification compri&s;es in it the pardon of &s;in, was &s;hown in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e: Nor will this be deni|ed by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t likely to deny the general doctrine here advanced: &s;ince ju&s;tification is thus defined in the <HI>A&s;&s;embly's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> "Ju&s;tification is an act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God's free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our &s;ins, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOW &s;ince, at lea&s;t, <HI>that one</HI> chri&s;tian duty of forgiving an offending brother, is requi&s;ite in order to our being forgiven our&s;elves; and, con&s;equently, in order to our being ju&s;tified; how can the faith, by which we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified, be oppo&s;ed to chri&s;tian obedience? or un|der&s;tood exclu&s;ively of it? Is it not a ma|nife&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="007488_0214_102B910991AB6830">
contradiction to &s;ay, that we are ju&s;tified by faith alone, in the <HI>modern</HI> &s;en&s;e, by faith as di&s;tingui&s;hed from obe|dience; and yet to &s;ay, that our forgive|ne&s;s with God (a primary and principal branch of our ju&s;tification) is &s;u&s;pended on the condition of forgiving our neighbour his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es? There cannot well be a greater &s;oleci&s;m, or repugnancy. We are therefore reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity; to this dilemma: We mu&s;t either deny, that our forgivene&s;s is &s;u&s;pended upon our for|giving others; (tho' our Saviour has ex|pre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted it) or el&s;e we mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that the faith, by which we are ju&s;tified, involves obedience in it, in|&s;tead of being oppo&s;ed thereto. The al|ternative is unavoidable; there is no me|dium in this ca&s;e, if pardon is an e&s;&s;ential part of ju&s;tification; which is now taken for granted.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;ufficient to &s;how in general, that the vulgar notion of ju&s;tification by faith alone, cannot be true. It is at lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, that we add to our faith, <HI>that one</HI> virtue of forgiving others their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es. And here I may a&s;k, Whether, &s;ince this one is required, in order to our being pardoned and ju&s;tified, it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that all other chri&s;tian virtues are nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ame
<PB N="210" REF="007488_0215_102B910BD9EE9490">
end? What ground is there to imagine, that this one duty is made nece&s;&s;ary, and that others, of equal importance, are un|nece&s;&s;ary? Our Saviour's particularly mentioning and requiring this, does not exclude others; but it may be naturally inferred, that all other evangelical graces and virtues are nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e: E&s;pe|cially &s;ince no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign|ed, why our pardon and ju&s;tification &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended upon this, rather than upon many other duties of Chri&s;tianity; &s;uch as the love or fear of God, love and gratitude to our Saviour, and ju&s;tice to|wards man. Indeed if there is &s;uch a natural and nece&s;&s;ary connection betwixt the &s;everal graces and virtues of Chri&s;tia|nity, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e; if he that is de&s;ti|tute of one, mu&s;t needs be de&s;titute of all; and if he that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one, mu&s;t al&s;o be the &s;ubject of all; it follows, that they are all equally nece&s;&s;ary to par|don and ju&s;tification, or equally unnece&s;|&s;ary: So that the requiring of any one, is, in effect, the requiring of all; and if there is any one, which is not nece&s;&s;ary, no other can be nece&s;&s;ary. This is, indeed, only an argument <HI>ad hominem.</HI> And be|cau&s;e I am not certain, that there is real|ly, any &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary concatenation or connexion, betwixt the various graces
<PB N="211" REF="007488_0216_102B910E0FCFD230">
and virtues of Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall not in|&s;i&s;t upon it. But,</P>
<P>2dly, THAT faith cannot be oppo&s;ed to evangelical obedience, when we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified thereby, appears from the &s;cripture-doctrine of <HI>repentance.</HI> It will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be denied, that par|don, or the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, is &s;u&s;|pended on our repentance. But becau&s;e tho&s;e, with whom I am concerned, can deny almo&s;t any thing, I &s;hall prove this point before I deduce the con&s;equence intended. The few pa&s;&s;ages following may &s;uffice&mdash;"Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon."&mdash;"I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth; but that the wicked for&s;ake his way and live"&mdash;"Ex|cept ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e per|i&s;h."&mdash;"That repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name."&mdash;"Repent and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out."&mdash;"Te&s;tifying both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith to|wards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."&mdash;"He that covereth his Sins &s;hall not pro&s;per; but who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh them,

&s;hall find mercy."&mdash;"If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s."&mdash;The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages abundantly &s;how, that our forgivene&s;s, pardon, or acceptance to the divine favour, depends upon our repenting of our &s;ins; that eve|ry true penitent &s;hall obtain mercy; and that all impenitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall final|ly be condemned.</P>
<P>NOW if repentance is really nece&s;&s;ary in order to our obtaining pardon, it mu&s;t be equally nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified: Since, as has more than once been ob&s;erved, our pardon is involved in our ju&s;tification, and is an e&s;&s;ential and principal part of it. It is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be ju&s;tified without that repen|tance, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the pardon of our &s;ins: for this were to &s;uppo&s;e, that ju&s;tification is &s;omething di&s;tinct from, and prior to, our forgivene&s;s. Repen|tance, then, being nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being pardoned; and therefore ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified; let us briefly con&s;ider the &s;cripture notion of repentance; and what is implied in it. Now it is manife&s;t, that by repentance, the &s;cripture intends, a turning from &s;in to God, accompanied with humiliation and &s;orrow for having offended Him. It
<PB N="213" REF="007488_0218_102B911173FCB740">
is a principle of holine&s;s and univer&s;al o|bedience; the beginning of a new life, devoted to God and his Service. Evan|gelical repentance, therefore, compri&s;es in it, evangelical obedience: So that if the former be nece&s;&s;ary in order to par|don, and ju&s;tification unto life, the latter mu&s;t be &s;o too. To &s;ay, that repentance is nece&s;&s;ary, and yet to &s;ay that the for|&s;aking of our &s;ins, and entering upon a cour&s;e of obedience to God's command|ments, (in which repentance con&s;i&s;ts) is unnece&s;&s;ary, is a plain contradiction.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e premi&s;es, the conclu&s;ion is very obvious to tho&s;e who will, with|out prejudice, attend to it; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we are not ju&s;tified by faith alone, exclu|&s;ively of evangelical obedience; but by faith, con&s;idered as the beginning, and the great principle of it. Is there not a very manife&s;t repugnancy betwixt the&s;e two propo&s;itions?&mdash;Repentance, which involves in it a turning from &s;in to God, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our forgivene&s;s and ju&s;tification:&mdash;But yet faith alone, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from repentance and new obedience, ju&s;tifies us. He mu&s;t have a head peculiarly turned for making &s;ubtile di&s;tinctions, that will undertake to recon|cile them. They are contradictory; and &s;ince the former of the&s;e propo&s;itions has

<P>THE rea&s;oning under this head, may perhaps &s;eem intricate and ab&s;tru&s;e to &s;ome. But the argument, if I mi&s;take not, is &s;trictly conclu&s;ive. The &s;um of it is this&mdash;Pardon being an e&s;&s;ential part of our ju&s;tification; and repentance be|ing nece&s;&s;ary in order to pardon, repen|tance mu&s;t al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary in order to ju&s;tification. And &s;ince repentance in|volves evangelical obedience in it, and is, indeed, the beginning of it; &s;uch obedi|ence mu&s;t al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified. And therefore, when the &s;criptures &s;peak of our being ju&s;tified by <HI>faith, faith</HI> cannot be oppo&s;ed to <HI>obedience,</HI> in the <HI>modern</HI> way of interpretation; but mu&s;t comprehend it. So that tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon by the <HI>Solifidians,</HI> are not only capable of a different &s;en&s;e from that which they put upon them; but there is an ab&s;olute <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of interpreting them otherwi&s;e. Indeed if the pardon of &s;in is not an e&s;|&s;ential part of our ju&s;tification; or if re|pentance is not nece&s;&s;ary in order to par|don; or, la&s;tly, if repentance does not involve in it a turning <HI>from dead works, to &s;erve the living God;</HI> then the argu|ment u&s;ed above, is inconclu&s;ive; and
<PB N="215" REF="007488_0220_102B911616E3DD00">
faith alone may ju&s;tify. But if tho&s;e po|&s;itions are true, as they evidently are, the <HI>modern</HI> notion of ju&s;tification by faith alone, mu&s;t be both fal&s;e and futile: And the advocates for it, amu&s;e them&s;elves with the more found of words.</P>
<P>3dly, WHATSOEVER is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his peculiar love and complacency, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;tification. But in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his &s;pecial love and compla|cency, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we for&s;ake our Sins, and obey the Go&s;pel: This is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;tification. The two propo&s;itions from whence this conclu&s;ion is drawn, I &s;hall briefly prove.</P>
<P>THE <HI>former</HI> of them is, That what|&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being at peace with God, and becoming the objects of his peculiar love and compla|cency, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;ti|fication: The proof of which is &s;hort and ea&s;y. It is in our ju&s;tification, that we commence the objects of the divine love, as expre&s;&s;ed in the propo&s;ition; neither before we are ju&s;tified, nor afterwards; but at the &s;ame in&s;tant. And indeed our being thus reconciled to, and at peace with, our Maker, is not any thing really
<PB N="216" REF="007488_0221_102B9117A0143050">
di&s;tinct from our being ju&s;tified; but one of the ble&s;&s;ings or privileges implied therein. So that our becoming the ob|jects of God's &s;pecial love, is not only cotemporary with our ju&s;tification; but the former is involved in the latter, in&s;e|parable from it, and an e&s;&s;ential part of that compound idea. It is a contradicti|on to &s;uppo&s;e a man ju&s;tified, without &s;uppo&s;ing him beloved of God; or <HI>vice vers&acirc;,</HI> beloved of God, and yet not ju&s;ti|fied. The ideas are coincident, and mu|tually imply each other: So that who&s;o|ever is ju&s;tified, is at peace with God, and the object of his complacency; and who&s;oever is thus at peace with God, is ju&s;tified of him. Now the&s;e ideas (or the&s;e things) being thus coincident, thus in&s;eparable, and thus mutually inferring and implying each other, it is a contra|diction to &s;uppo&s;e that any thing &s;hould be requi&s;ite in order to one, which is not equally requi&s;ite in order to the other. To &s;uppo&s;e that our being beloved of God, depends upon one condition, and our being ju&s;tified, on another condition; is to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e things di&s;tinct, and &s;e|parable from each other; which they are not, according to the &s;cripture account of them. We are therefore, if we ad|here to this account, obliged to own,
<PB N="217" REF="007488_0222_102B911928EBFB90">
that what&s;oever God has required of us in order to conciliate his &s;pecial love and friend&s;hip, is equally required in order to our being ju&s;tified of him. Certainly more cannot be nece&s;&s;ary in order to the former, than is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the latter: For if more were nece&s;&s;ary, it would follow, that we might be ju&s;tified without, and antecedently to our being in a &s;tate of favour and friend&s;hip with God; which were a manife&s;t repug|nancy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other</HI> propo&s;ition to be proved, is, That, in order to our becoming the ob|jects of God's &s;pecial love, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that we for&s;ake our &s;ins, and obey the go&s;pel: The proof of which is &s;till more plain and direct. For <HI>there is no peace,</HI> faith God, <HI>to the wicked.</HI> He has &s;aid, that he is <HI>angry with the wicked every day; and that if they turn not he will whet his &s;word</HI>&mdash;No one, in &s;hort, can look in|to his bible, without finding <HI>the wrath of God there revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men;</HI> a|gain&s;t all impenitent and unreformed Sin|ners. So far are per&s;ons of this character from being the objects of God's &s;pecial love and complacency! The doctrine of &s;cripture, from <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the <HI>Revelation</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> is, that &s;o long as men per&s;e|vere
<PB N="218" REF="007488_0223_102B911B512FB050">
in their evil ways, they are at en|mity with God, and abhorred of him; that they cannot be reconciled to Him, or He to them, without <HI>turning their feet into his te&s;timonies.</HI> This is what the &s;cripture, thro'out, repre&s;ents to us as in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our be|ing at peace with our offended Maker; and to our being beloved of him as his &s;ervants and children.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion follows of cour&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that we cannot be ju&s;tified without, or antecedently to, our thus turning unto God, and doing the will of our Father which is in Heaven. Becau&s;e, as was &s;aid before, what&s;oever is requi&s;ite in or|der to the former, mu&s;t, in the nature of the thing, be equally nece&s;&s;ary in order to the latter. Whenever the &s;cripture &s;peaks of our being ju&s;tified by <HI>faith,</HI> there is, therefore, a nece&s;&s;ity of under|&s;tanding the term <HI>faith,</HI> in a complex &s;en&s;e; not as it is contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from re|pentance and obedience, but in &s;uch a latitude as to include them. For other|wi&s;e there will be an irreconcileable con|tradiction betwixt tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Scrip|ture, and many others: I now mean, more particularly, &s;uch as make the for|&s;aking of our &s;ins, and the keeping of God's commandments, nece&s;&s;ary in or|der
<PB N="219" REF="007488_0224_102B911D2FFD81D8">
to our becoming the objects of his paternal love and favour. If this is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, it is ab&s;urd, and even a plain contradiction to imagine, that we can be ju&s;tified by <HI>faith only;</HI> under&s;tanding faith in the modern re&s;trained &s;en&s;e; and as it is oppo&s;ed to go&s;pel-obedience.</P>
<P>4thly, WHATSOEVER is nece&s;&s;ary, according to the terms laid down in the go&s;pel, in order to our having a <HI>title</HI> to eternal life in the kingdom of heaven, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified in this world. But in order to our hav|ing &s;uch a title, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that we repent of our &s;ins, and obey the go&s;pel: This is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>THE <HI>former</HI> propo&s;ition is, that what|ever the go&s;pel makes nece&s;&s;ary in order to our having a <HI>title</HI> to eternal life hereaf|ter, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our ju&s;tifica|tion here. The truth of which, can, I think, admit of no di&s;pute; it being evi|dent from the account already given of ju&s;tification, and the ble&s;&s;ings and privi|leges implied in it. A title to eternal Life is involved in the &s;cripture-idea of ju&s;tifi|cation; and is an e&s;&s;ential part of it. We can neither be ju&s;tified without this title; nor have this title without being ju&s;tified; they mutually infer and imply each o|ther,
<PB N="220" REF="007488_0225_102B911F6A374BF8">
and are in&s;eparable. So that it is a contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that we are ju&s;tified antecedently to our having a title to &s;alvation; or upon any other, or low|er terms, than tho&s;e to which the pro|mi&s;e of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is made. A&s;&s;oon as a man is ju&s;tified, or rather in his ju&s;ti|fication, this title is given to him; and not before. While we keep to the true idea of ju&s;tification, as it involves in it the promi&s;e of future glory, and a right, thro' grace, to the Heavenly inheritance; we cannot even make the &s;uppo&s;ition of our being ju&s;tified on other terms than tho&s;e, on which eternal life is offered to us, without perceiving the &s;elf-repugnan|cy of it. The ideas of ju&s;tification, and of the title here intended, tho' different in &s;ome re&s;pects, are yet &s;o far coincident, and have &s;uch a connexion and mutual dependence, that we may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that whatever God requires of us in order to our being entitled to Heaven and happi|ne&s;s, mu&s;t al&s;o be required in order to our ju&s;tification. For otherwi&s;e we might be ju&s;tified without having the title mention|ed; <HI>i. e.</HI> ju&s;tified without &s;omething, which is implied in the very notion of ju&s;tification; which is a contradiction.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other</HI> propo&s;ition is, That in or|der to our having a title to eternal life,
<PB N="221" REF="007488_0226_102B9120F2E09110">
it is nece&s;&s;ary that we repent of our &s;ins, and obey the go&s;pel. And agreably here|to it is &s;aid, "Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have <HI>right</HI> to the tree of life." There are no promi&s;es of future glory and happine&s;s, made in the &s;criptures, to impenitent, per&s;evering tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. They are all made to tho&s;e who confe&s;s and for&s;ake their &s;ins. The go&s;pel is &s;o far from giv|ing any title to future glory, to the im|penitent workers of iniquity, that it ex|pre&s;sly condemns them, and cuts them off from it. "Know ye not, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, that the the <HI>unrighteous</HI> &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators," &amp;c. It is &s;aid, that God will render to them that "obey not the truth, but obey un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wrath; even upon every &s;oul of man that doth evil." It is not, &s;urely po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame go&s;pel, which &s;peaks thus to, and of, the wicked and di&s;obedient, condemn|ing them to future woe and puni&s;hment, &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, entitle them, by it's promi&s;es, to life everla&s;ting&mdash;Now &s;ince nothing is required of us, in order to our being entitled to eternal life, but what is equally required in order to our being ju&s;tified; (as was &s;hown above)
<PB N="222" REF="007488_0227_102B9123EE321C60">
and &s;ince, in order to our being entitled to eternal life, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we re|pent of our &s;ins and obey the go&s;pel, (as we have ju&s;t now &s;een) it undoubtedly follows, that repentance and evangelical obedience are nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified. And hence it is farther evident, that when we are &s;aid to be ju&s;|tified by <HI>faith, faith</HI> is not, in &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture, contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from repentance and new obedience; but mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be con&s;idered as compri&s;ing them in it.</P>
<P>5thly, THE main point to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, will be &s;till more evident from a cur&s;ory view of St. <HI>James'</HI>s doctrine in this epi&s;tle: One main de&s;ign of which appears plain|ly to be, the re&s;cuing of St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s doc|trine of ju&s;tification, from the abu&s;es and fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es which began, even then, to be put upon it by licentious men. Or, at lea&s;t, St. <HI>James</HI> de&s;igned to guard the Church in &s;ucceeding times, again&s;t &s;uch abu&s;es and corruptions in this re&s;pect, as he &s;aw likely to creep into it, and which have, &s;ince, actually over&s;pread and di&s;|honoured a con&s;iderable part of it. For that this apo&s;tle profe&s;&s;edly oppo&s;es the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith only, in the <HI>modern</HI> &s;en&s;e of the term, is as evident as words can make any thing to be. And
<PB N="223" REF="007488_0228_102B9125CF137388">
all the attempts that have been made to reconcile St. <HI>James'</HI>s doctrine, to the fond conceits of tho&s;e who are for exalting faith, at the expence of holine&s;s and good works, are equally futile and un|natural.</P>
<P>IT is more e&s;pecially in the &s;econd chapter of this epi&s;tle, that the apo&s;tle ex|plodes and refutes the&s;e fooli&s;h and per|nicious conceits. At the tenth ver&s;e he tells us, That "Who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law," (meaning the <HI>law of liberty,</HI> as it is called ver. 12, and which is no o|ther than the go&s;pel-rule of life and man|ners) and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." The plain meaning of which is, that who&s;oever &s;hall habitually tran&s;gre&s;s any one known precept of the go&s;pel, is not in a &s;tate of favour with God; but as certainly lies under condem|nation, as if he violated them all. The apo&s;tle then admoni&s;hes us to live and act in all re&s;pects, as becomes tho&s;e who are hereafter to be judged according to this law&mdash;"So &s;peak ye, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liber|ty." Now if we are to be judged by this law, it is certain that we &s;hall be either ju&s;tified or condemned by it, according as we have, or have not, yielded a &s;incere and univer&s;al obedience to the precepts
<PB N="224" REF="007488_0229_102B912756812390">
of it. This is nece&s;&s;arily implied in our being judged by it. From whence it is an obvious inference, that we cannot <HI>now</HI> be ju&s;tified by this law of liberty, [the go&s;pel] without obeying it. This law will be the &s;ame, in it&s;elf, in the day of judgment, that it is at pre&s;ent: And all who will be condemned by it, in that day, are equally condemned by it now. It cannot now ju&s;tify the &s;ame per&s;ons, whom it will condemn, when it &s;hall be put into execution by the judge of quick and dead. Or will any one &s;ay, that we may now be ju&s;tified by the law of liber|ty, on account of our <HI>faith;</HI> and yet be condemned by it hereafter, on account of our <HI>di&s;obedience?</HI> This &s;eems to be too ab&s;urd for any one to a&s;&s;ert or &s;uppo&s;e. But were it &s;uppo&s;eable, yet <HI>That</HI> ju&s;tifi|cation, which does not exempt us from future condemnation; <HI>That</HI> which we may be the &s;ubjects of here, and yet be &s;entenced to woe and mi&s;ery hereafter for our &s;ins, is a thing of but little value or importance to us; Our great concern is, to know and to do that, which will en|title us to the approbation of our Judge, in the great day of his appearing. Even the law of liberty will not then ju&s;tify us, unle&s;s we have &s;incerely obeyed it: And this being the ca&s;e, it is manife&s;t, as was
<PB N="225" REF="007488_0230_102B9128DFAF0DB0">
&s;aid before, that it cannot ju&s;tify us now, if we di&s;obey it; that law being &s;till the &s;ame. And all the <HI>Solifidians</HI> in the world might be defied to an&s;wer this &s;ingle ar|gument, were there no others.</P>
<P>BUT the apo&s;tle proceeds (ver. 14.) more particularly to con&s;ider the in|fluence of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works;</HI> and from thence to the end of the chapter, pro|fe&s;&s;edly combates this notion, that a man is ju&s;tified by the <HI>former,</HI> independently of the <HI>latter</HI>&mdash;"What doth it profit, my brethren, tho' a man &s;ay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith &s;ave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Can faith <HI>&s;ave</HI> him?" Some who a&s;&s;ert the &s;ufficiency of faith to <HI>ju&s;tify;</HI> &s;till allow that it is not &s;ufficient to <HI>&s;ave:</HI> But the Apo&s;tle makes no &s;uch idle di&s;tinction. The &s;cope of his argument requires, that by <HI>&s;aving,</HI> he &s;hould here mean <HI>ju&s;tifying;</HI> and accordingly he &s;ub|&s;titutes the latter term in the room of the former, in the following ver&s;es.</NOTE> him?" As if he had &s;aid: Of what &s;igni|ficancy or advantage is it, for a man to talk and boa&s;t of his faith, if his faith is not accompanied with obedience? Can faith entitle <HI>Him</HI> to the favour of God, and eternal life, who does not obey the commandments of Chri&s;t, as well as be|lieve in him? Vain, ab&s;urd imagination! He goes on: "If a brother or &s;i&s;ter be naked, and de&s;titute of daily food; and one of you &s;ay unto them, Depart in
<PB N="226" REF="007488_0231_102B912B9C6A4EA8">
peace, be you warmed, and filled; not|with&s;tanding ye give them not tho&s;e things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? Even &s;o faith, if it hath not works is dead being alone." <HI>q. d.</HI> If you give your nece&s;&s;itous brethren only good words, in&s;tead of relieving their wants; of what &s;ignificancy is this? It is rather to mock and in&s;ult them, than to do them any real kindne&s;s. And faith is ju&s;t as in&s;ignificant as tho&s;e good words, if it is not attended with charity and righteou&s;ne&s;s. Being thus alone, it is a dead u&s;ele&s;s thing; and can no more ju&s;tify or &s;ave the &s;ubjects of it, than fair &s;oft words can feed and cloath tho&s;e, who are peri&s;hing with hunger and cold.&mdash;"Yea a man may &s;ay, Thou ha&s;t faith, and I have works: Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will &s;hew thee my faith by my works." As if he had &s;aid: Yea, one might rea&s;on after this manner with you; You pretend to have faith; and perhaps you really have: But I have works, which demon&s;trate that I have faith. Whereas you cannot make it appear, even that you have any faith, unle&s;s your behaviour bears wit|ne&s;s for you. Shew me, if you can, that you have any faith, without works: This is impo&s;&s;ible; but I will make it evident
<PB N="227" REF="007488_0232_102B912D23B58290">
that I am a believer, by my good life. So that faith is not only in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify and &s;ave a man; but no man can even prove that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, with|out works.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle proceeds: "Thou be|lieve&s;t that there is one God; thou do&s;t well: the devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead." <HI>q. d.</HI> Thou wilt tell me, perhaps, that thou believe&s;t in the One true God. Be it &s;o: Thus far it is well: But you cannot rea&s;onably think that you are hereby ju&s;tified; for even the apo&s;tate angels believe, and yet ju&s;tly tremble; being <HI>re&s;erved in chains under darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day:</HI> To which condemnation you al|&s;o &s;tand expo&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding your faith, while you per&s;evere in your &s;ins. O vain, fooli&s;h man! wilt thou not at length be &s;en&s;ible, that faith without o|bedience, is a dead u&s;ele&s;s thing, of no profit or advantage? St. <HI>James</HI> goes on to illu&s;trate and confirm his doctrine by the example of <HI>Abraham.</HI> "Was not <HI>A|braham</HI> our father ju&s;tified by Works, when he had offered <HI>I&s;aac</HI> his &s;on upon the Altar? See&s;t thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect." <HI>q. d.</HI> You may be convin|ced
<PB N="228" REF="007488_0233_102B84A23AEFF788">
by the &s;tory of <HI>Abraham,</HI> that a man mu&s;t <HI>obey</HI> as well as <HI>believe,</HI> in order to his being ju&s;tified. For was not he, our common father, and the father of the faithful, ju&s;tified, in effect, by works; when he &s;ubmitted to the command and authority of God, in preparing to &s;acri|fice his &s;on? See&s;t thou not how his faith was exerci&s;ed, and exerted it&s;elf in works of obedience, receiving thence all its value and efficacy? And that it would have been imperfect, dead and u&s;ele&s;s, had it not been accompanied with an obedient heart. "And the &s;cripture was fulfilled which &s;aith, <HI>Abraham</HI> believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s; and he was called the friend of God." <HI>q. d.</HI> And thus was the &s;cripture verified, which tells us, that <HI>Abraham</HI> was a reli|gious believer in God; and this his pious and obedient faith, procured him the di|vine approbation; it being, thro' grace, reckoned to him and accepted of God, as righteou&s;ne&s;s. So that he was high in the divine favour; and obtained that glorious te&s;timony, that he was God's Friend: Which character he could never have obtained, had he not added works to his faith. "Ye &s;ee then, &s;ays the A|po&s;tle, how that by works a man is ju&s;ti|fied, and not by faith only." <HI>q. d.</HI> Ye
<PB N="229" REF="007488_0234_102B9130E929E338">
may be a&s;&s;ured therefore, that it is by o|bedience to God's commands, that a man is ju&s;tified in his &s;ight; and not, as &s;ome may vainly imagine, only by believing.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle having ob&s;erved, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> as well as <HI>Abraham,</HI> was ju&s;tified by works; clo&s;es this &s;ubject with the fol|lowing &s;imilitude. "As the body with|out the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o faith without works is dead al&s;o." As if he had &s;aid: So far is it from being true, that faith a|lone is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify us, and that our obedience is not al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to that end; &s;o far is this from being the truth of the ca&s;e, that obedience gives to faith all its worth and value and efficacy. In &s;hort works are to faith, that which the &s;pirit is to the body. As the body, being deprived of the &s;pirit which &s;hould inform and animate it, becomes a mere carca&s;e, a dead lump of matter, void of all vigor and energy, and unable to perform any of the proper vital functions; &s;o faith, being &s;eparated from works, or not attended with them, is a dead, u&s;ele&s;s thing; and as unable to ju&s;tify the &s;ubjects of it, as a breathle&s;s corps is to perform the actions of a living man.</P>

oppo&s;es, directly and profe&s;&s;edly oppo&s;es, and not only oppo&s;es, but refutes, the notion of ju&s;tification by faith alone; or faith con&s;idered independently of obedi|ence. Tell me, then, do not tho&s;e per|&s;ons &s;ow di&s;cord betwixt brethren, who interpret St <HI>Paul</HI> as teaching the contrary doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, ab&s;tract|ly con&s;idered, and in contradi&s;tinction from works? They certainly make as wide a breach betwixt the&s;e two apo&s;tles, as happened heretofore betwixt the latter of them, and <HI>Barnabas.</HI> And this they do without any nece&s;&s;ity. Becau&s;e what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays concerning ju&s;tification <HI>by faith without the deeds of law,</HI> admits of a fair and ea&s;y interpretation, in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with St. <HI>James'</HI>s doctrine as explained a|bove: Whereas St. <HI>James'</HI>s doctrine here, cannot, by all the &s;ubtlety of man, be na|turally and fairly explained in any toler|able con&s;i&s;tency with St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s, provided the de&s;ign of St. <HI>Paul</HI> was to oppo&s;e faith to evangelical obedience; and to teach, that ju&s;tification comes by the former, exclu&s;ively of the latter.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal ways, in which St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s doctrine may be made to harmo|nize with St. <HI>James'</HI>s, without putting any unnatural force upon the words of either. For example; (1.) When St.

<HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, that we are ju&s;tified by <HI>faith, faith</HI> may be under&s;tood <HI>objectively;</HI> as if he had &s;aid, we are ju&s;tified by the <HI>go&s;pel;</HI> and not by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> And this interpretation is much counte|nanced by the &s;cope of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, where he treats of ju&s;tification. (2) Whenever faith is to be under&s;tood <HI>&s;ub|jectively,</HI> (as it certainly <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be in many places) it is no unnatural con&s;truction, to under&s;tand the term as comprehen&s;ive of the <HI>whole chri&s;tian temper,</HI> and that obe|dience which the go&s;pel requires of us.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that this cannot be St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s meaning, becau&s;e he oppo&s;es faith to <HI>works,</HI> and to the <HI>deeds of law;</HI> &s;ince faith really includes them, accor|ding to this interpretation: Tho' this is the principal difficulty, it admits of a very ea&s;y &s;olution. For by works, and the deeds of law, in the&s;e places, may be meant, either the ceremonial and ritu|al ob&s;ervances of the <HI>mo&s;aic</HI> law; as if the apo&s;tle had &s;aid, "A man is ju&s;tified by believing and obeying the go&s;pel; not by tho&s;e legal ob&s;ervances, to which the <HI>Jews</HI> are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t:" Or by works and the deeds of law, may be un|der&s;tood a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would exclude grace, and which no one ever performed; as if he had &s;aid, "We
<PB N="232" REF="007488_0237_102B91371DBFD840">
are ju&s;tified by a &s;incere, tho' imperfect obedience to the go&s;pel, thro' the mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; not by our works, con&s;idered as &s;trictly conformable to law; in which &s;en&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that any <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;or</HI> of the law &s;hould be ju&s;ti|fied&mdash;Now in either of the&s;e ways, the di&s;tinction which St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes betwixt faith and works, when he oppo&s;es the one to the other, is &s;ufficiently pre&s;erved: And either of the&s;e interpretations will perfectly harmonize with St. <HI>James'</HI>s doctrine, That a man is not ju&s;tified by faith, exclu&s;ively of that obedience to the laws of Chri&s;t, which ought to accompa|ny it; and without which it is dead.</P>
<P>THE Attempts made to reconcile St. <HI>James</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> on the contrary hy|pothe&s;is, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that St. <HI>Paul</HI> teaches the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone, or faith in contradi&s;tinction from evangeli|cal obedience) have hitherto been to little purpo&s;e: unle&s;s it is to &s;how the perplex|ing &s;treights, to which the advocates for that hypothe&s;is are driven; and how un|able they are to &s;upport it, without u&s;ing unnatural violence with the &s;criptures. Let me give a &s;pecimen of the&s;e attempts, in order to &s;upport and verify this a&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;uppo&s;ed that St. <HI>Paul</HI> and
<PB N="233" REF="007488_0238_102B9138A979E798">
St. <HI>James</HI> &s;peak of two <HI>kinds</HI> of faith; the former, of a true, evangelical and opera|tive faith, the latter of a dead, hi&s;torical, and notional faith, quite different there|from: That the fir&s;t kind ju&s;tifies without, and independently of, works; but that the latter does not. In an&s;wer to which, I &s;hall make one or two &s;hort remarks.</P>
<P>IT is evident that St. <HI>James</HI> intended no &s;uch di&s;tinction; becau&s;e he &s;peaks of faith at large, in the mo&s;t general and un|limited &s;en&s;e. "Can faith &s;ave him."&mdash;"What doth it profit"&mdash;"Faith without works is dead."&mdash;"A man is ju&s;tified&mdash;not by faith only. "He does not &s;ay, that this or that <HI>particular kind</HI> of faith cannot <HI>&s;ave,</HI> cannot <HI>profit,</HI> cannot <HI>ju&s;tify,</HI> without works: But the &s;en&s;e is plainly this, that <HI>No kind</HI> of faith whatever, can &s;ave, pro|fit or ju&s;tify, without works; or of it&s;elf alone. Moreover,</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle is here &s;peaking of &s;uch a faith as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Rahab</HI> were the &s;ubjects of. The <HI>former</HI> of whom, at lea&s;t, it is to be pre&s;umed, had as good a faith as any one can pretend to, &s;ince he is called the <HI>father of the faithful.</HI> And yet the apo&s;tle denies that either of the&s;e per|&s;ons was ju&s;tified by faith alone; He a&s;|&s;erts that they were ju&s;tified by works&mdash;"Was not <HI>Abraham</HI> our father ju&s;tified
<PB N="234" REF="007488_0239_102B913A4B23E208">
by works"&mdash;"Likewi&s;e al&s;o was not <HI>Ra|hab</HI> ju&s;tified by works."&mdash;Now if <HI>Abraham</HI> him&s;elf, the goodne&s;s, and evangelical nature of who&s;e faith, is not di&s;puted by any, was not ju&s;tified by faith, con&s;ider|ed in contradi&s;tinction from, and in op|po&s;ition to, works; certainly no other believer can be thus ju&s;tified by faith a|lone. But,</P>
<P>LET us, for the pre&s;ent, take it for gran|ted, that St. <HI>James</HI> is not &s;peaking of a true evangelical faith, when he &s;ays, that faith cannot &s;ave, profit or ju&s;tify, without works; but &s;peaking of &s;uch an idle, hi&s;|torical and inoperative faith, as is pre|tended by &s;ome: And let us then &s;ee what his doctrine will amount to. And I think it will be manife&s;tly this, according to the pre&s;ent hypothe&s;is; <ABBR><HI>viz;</HI></ABBR> That tho' an <HI>idle, hi&s;torical, inoperative</HI> faith, cannot ju&s;tify without works; yet <HI>&s;uch a faith</HI> might &s;ave, profit and ju&s;tify, with works: (for this is plainly implied.) But there is another <HI>peculiar</HI> kind of faith, a truly e|vangelical, a living and working faith, which ju&s;tifies without works, and ex|clu&s;ively of them! And again: when the apo&s;tle &s;ays, (ver. 24.) "Ye &s;ee then how that by works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith <HI>only</HI>"; according to the pre|&s;ent hypothe&s;is, the &s;en&s;e (or rather the
<PB N="235" REF="007488_0240_102B913D24841D30">
non&s;en&s;e) of the a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be this; That a man is ju&s;tified, not <HI>only</HI> by a dead, inoperative, and idle faith, a faith that worketh not; not <HI>only</HI> by &s;uch a faith; but by &s;uch a faith in <HI>conjunction</HI> with good works! Now let me a&s;k any &s;ober man, Whether &s;uch <HI>&s;tuff</HI> as this, is worthy the pen of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle? And whether this method of reconciling St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James,</HI> is not to pervert and wre&s;t the plain meaning of the latter; and make him &s;peak right-down <HI>Non|&s;en&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER way of reconciling St. <HI>James</HI> to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> (or rather of making him contradict him&s;elf) is this: It is &s;aid, that he is not here &s;peaking of what is nece&s;&s;ary to our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God; but of what is nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;tification of our <HI>faith;</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to the making it <HI>evident</HI> to others, that we have <HI>true</HI> faith. It is &s;aid, that tho' faith, ex|clu&s;ively of obedience or works, ju&s;tifies us before God; yet we cannot exhibit a proof and evidence of our faith to others, without works: And that accordingly, by being ju&s;tified, the Apo&s;tle here means, ju&s;tified to the world, and in the &s;ight of all men, as true &s;incere chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>LET us briefly examine this pretended &s;olution of the difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="007488_0241_102B913F075DC1E8">
And it is to be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>THAT this is quite an arbitrary inter|pretation; altogether unwarranted, and unnatural. The <HI>ju&s;tifying of a man's faith</HI> is, in it&s;elf, an uncouth, ridiculous ex|pre&s;&s;ion: And tho&s;e make much too bold with the apo&s;tle, who apply that to <HI>faith,</HI> which he &s;ays of <HI>men,</HI> of <HI>per&s;ons.</HI> The principal, if not the only thing alledged in &s;upport of this interpretation, is, that St. <HI>James</HI> &s;peaks, in ver. 18. of <HI>&s;hewing</HI> our faith by works. Upon this &s;lender foundation it is, that &s;ome men have in|terpreted all that he &s;ays in this pa&s;&s;age concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of obedience and works to ju&s;tification, of the need of works in order to <HI>&s;hew</HI> that we have faith. Whereas it is evident, that what the a|po&s;tle &s;ays in <HI>that</HI> ver&s;e, is merely inci|dental; &s;omething quite di&s;tinct from his main argument, and general de&s;ign. Having before &s;hown, that faith without works, was unable to &s;ave; that it was a dead, u&s;ele&s;s, unprofitable thing; he then tells tho&s;e with whom he is arguing, (as it were in a parenthe&s;is) that faith was &s;o far from ju&s;tifying them, that they could not even make it <HI>manife&s;t</HI> that they had any faith at all, but by their works. He tells them, that one <HI>might,</HI> were it needful, rea&s;on with them thus: But he lets this
<PB N="237" REF="007488_0242_102B9140D4555280">
matter drop, with a bare mention; and then returns to his main argument; which he pur&s;ues to the end of the chapter.</P>
<P>BUT that the apo&s;tle does not intend the ju&s;tifying of our faith, or making it <HI>appear</HI> to the world, that we have faith; is demon&s;trable from ver. 24.&mdash;."Ye &s;ee then how that by works a man is ju&s;tifi|ed, and <HI>not by faith only.</HI>" According to the&s;e goodly interpreters of &s;cripture, the &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be this&mdash;"Ye &s;ee then how that a man's faith is ju&s;tified, or made <HI>e|vident</HI> to the world, by good works, and not <HI>only</HI> by faith." Or thus, "Faith is made to <HI>appear,</HI> not <HI>only</HI> by faith it&s;elf; but partly by faith and partly by works." Which, be&s;ides the Non&s;en&s;e of it, di|rectly militates even again&s;t that part of the pa&s;&s;age, (ver. 18) which they think warrants this interpretation. For there it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that faith cannot be <HI>&s;hewn at all,</HI> by faith it&s;elf; but <HI>only</HI> by works. And indeed, had St. <HI>James</HI> talked at the rate which they would make him, to &s;up|port their favourite &s;y&s;tem, One might be apt to que&s;tion, not only his in&s;piration, but even the &s;oundne&s;s of his under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IT is farther to be ob&s;erved, that St. <HI>James</HI> is &s;peaking in this pa&s;&s;age, concern|ing what is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>&s;alvation:</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="238" REF="007488_0243_102B9235D53342E8">
("Can faith &s;ave him?") It is therefore much more natural to under&s;tand him as treating here, of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, on whom alone our &s;alva|tion depends, than of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of men. We may be &s;aved hereafter, altho' men &s;hould think and &s;peak evil of us, and condemn us: Or we may peri&s;h, tho' we &s;hould <HI>appear righteous unto men.</HI> But in order to our &s;alvation hereafter, it is indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be ju&s;tified of God in this world: For it is only tho&s;e, "whom He fir&s;t ju&s;tifies, that He after|wards glorifies." We may therefore fair|ly conclude, that this is the ju&s;tification here di&s;cour&s;ed of.</P>
<P>AGAIN: That the apo&s;tle is treating of ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, ap|pears from what he &s;ays concerning <HI>Abraham.</HI> When he "believed God," and when "faith wrought with his works," "it was<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be ob&s;erved, that the particular que&s;tion here is not, <HI>What</HI> it was that was <HI>imputed to Abraham for righteou&s;|ne&s;s?</HI> whether it were his faith only, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from his obedience; or both of them conjunctly; or, as &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e, the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t? But the point is, whether the acceptance of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s per&s;on to the divine fa|vour, and his ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, is not implied in <HI>that phra&s;e?</HI></NOTE> imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s." By whom was it impu|ted? Certainly by that God, in whom he
<PB N="239" REF="007488_0244_102B84AF28A42108">
tru&s;ted and whom he obeyed; as appears from <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. 6. the place here referred to,&mdash;<HI>He believed in the LORD, and HE counted it to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Now we know, that for God to <HI>impute righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to a man, and to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> him, are phra&s;es that are equivalent in &s;cripture. So that there can be no rea&s;onable doubt, but that it is ju&s;tification in God's &s;ight, that is meant here, and throughout this pa&s;&s;age. Nor was <HI>Abraham</HI> only <HI>called the friend of God</HI> by men, on account of his obedience: but it was his obedient faith which <HI>made him &s;o.</HI> It is therefore evident, that St. <HI>James</HI> is not treating of ju&s;tification before men.</P>
<P>AND indeed it is, even at fir&s;t view, a very &s;trange unnatural &s;uppo&s;ition, that the apo&s;tle &s;hould labour &s;o much, <HI>only</HI> to prove that a man cannot <HI>appear</HI> ju&s;t and righteous in the &s;ight of men, merely by his faith, which is <HI>invi&s;ible;</HI> or without living righteou&s;ly. This is both &s;elf-evi|dent, &s;o as to need no formal proof; and, at the &s;ame time, a matter, comparative|ly &s;peaking, of but little importance. Tho' this is plainly the main &s;cope and drift of this whole pa&s;&s;age, unle&s;s it is our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, that is intended in it. And this con&s;ide|ration alone, is, I think, &s;ufficient to
<PB N="240" REF="007488_0245_102B84B0F2C4AC70">
that it is of a higher, and far more important ju&s;tification, than one in the eyes of men, that St. <HI>James</HI> is di&s;|cour&s;ing. The zeal and warmth which he di&s;covers in the cour&s;e of his argu|ment; the &s;olemnity and pathos of his expre&s;&s;ions; in &s;hort, the whole air of this pa&s;&s;age, is a demon&s;tration that the apo&s;tle is treating on a &s;ubject no le&s;s intere&s;ting, than that of our ju&s;tification with God, and the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. And the other &s;uppo&s;ition, that he is &s;peaking only of what is nece&s;&s;ary to make our faith <HI>apparent,</HI> that &s;o we may be ju&s;tified in the opinion and <HI>&s;ight of men,</HI> is as incon&s;i&s;tent with good <HI>Critici&s;m,</HI> as it is with <HI>&s;ound Theology.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have given you a <HI>&s;pecimen</HI> of the methods taken to make the&s;e two a|po&s;tles harmonize; taken, I mean, by tho&s;e who will have it, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> taught the doctrine of ju&s;tification by <HI>faith,</HI> as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>evange|lical obedience.</HI> The two methods which I have mentioned, are all that I have met with, which &s;eem to claim any notice. And how in&s;ufficient, how unnatural, even the&s;e &s;olutions are, it is pre&s;umed need not be made more apparent than it is already.

<PB N="241" REF="007488_0246_102B84B2C20522B8">
are demon&s;trably fal&s;e.

<P>BUT, as has been ob&s;erved before, it is ea&s;y to reconcile all that St. <HI>Paul</HI> has &s;aid concerning ju&s;tification by faith, with the doctrine, that evangelical obedience is required in order to our being ju&s;tified: (Which la&s;t is certainly the doctrine of St. <HI>James.</HI>) How this may be done, has been &s;hown before.&mdash;But if it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> ever taught the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone, in contradi&s;|tinction from obedience, the only que&s;|tion is not, How he can be reconciled with St. <HI>James?</HI> Another que&s;tion which naturally ari&s;es, is, How he can be recon|ciled with <HI>him&s;elf?</HI> In all his epi&s;tles, he a&s;&s;erts that impenitent, unreformed &s;in|ners, lye under wrath and condemnation. He therefore <HI>te&s;tified to them repentance to|wards God,</HI> as well as <HI>faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in order to their getting out of this &s;tate of condemnation; to their being reconciled to God, and entitled to eternal life. <Q>De&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the riches of

Certainly it is. How then can it be &s;up|po&s;ed that this &s;ame apo&s;tle in the &s;ame epi&s;tle, &s;hould teach, that faith alone, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from repentance and new obedience, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify us; and that it actually does &s;o? or if he had taught this latter doctrine, who could re|concile it with the other? and vindicate him again&s;t the imputation of <HI>&s;elf-contra|diction?</HI> The doctrines are diametrically repugnant to each other: And whoever &s;hall undertake to &s;how on one hand, that repentance and new obedience, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our obtaining the favour and mercy of God; and yet, on the other hand, that we are ju&s;tified by faith exclu|&s;ively of repentance and new obedience, will, I am per&s;waded, only <HI>darken coun&s;el by words without knowledge.</HI></P>

I INTENDED to have brought divers other arguments to &s;how the fal&s;hood of this too common doctrine, that we are ju&s;tified by faith alone, as faith is oppo&s;ed to go&s;pel-obedience.

<P N="1">1.

IF that faith which ju&s;tifies us, in|cludes in it a principle of obedience, as one e&s;&s;ential property of it, (as they generally a&s;&s;ert) then it is mo&s;t futile and ab&s;urd to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> faith and obedience, in the manner they do, one to the other; as tho' the former ju&s;tified us independently of the latter. For what is this, in effect, but to oppo&s;e a thing to it&s;elf; to that which is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of it? It is as if we &s;hould oppo&s;e the &s;un to the light and warmth of it; or the great <HI>Father of lights,</HI> to his e&s;&s;ential attributes: It is as if it were &s;aid, that tho' God made the worlds; yet they were not produced by his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; but exclu&s;ively of them!</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT the futility of this di&s;tinction, and the fal&s;hood of what is intended by it; is &s;till further evident from the pa&s;&s;age in St. <HI>James,</HI> which was con&s;idered above. For it appears from thence, not only, that we cannot be ju&s;tified by a faith that is without obedience; but al&s;o that it is obedience which gives to faith all it's life, efficacy and perfection. Without this, any faith, all faith is vain, dead, and unprofitable; utterly in&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify and &s;ave the &s;ubjects of it. It is this principle of obedience that is, as it

were the &s;oul and &s;pirit of faith; the very, the only thing, by which we can be ju&s;tified. So widely do tho&s;e mi&s;take the matter, and differ from St. <HI>James,</HI> who a&s;&s;ert, that tho' a ju&s;tifying faith is always productive of obedience; yet it is not this operative quality, which gives vir|tue and efficacy to it; but that a true faith ju&s;tifies, exclu&s;ively of the obedience im|plied in it. The Apo&s;tle more than inti|mates, that if faith con&s;idered indepen|dently of obedience, could ju&s;tify us, the <HI>Devils</HI> them&s;elves might be ju&s;tified as well as we!&mdash;But the&s;e men, it &s;eems, will not allow that <HI>that,</HI> upon which the a|po&s;tle lays, in a manner, the <HI>whole</HI> &s;tre&s;s of our ju&s;tification, &s;hould have any &s;tre&s;s <HI>at all</HI> laid upon it in this affair. Even while they allow, that the quality which e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hes a ju&s;tifying faith from any other, is its being operative; yet it mu&s;t not be allowed, that faith ju&s;ti|fies upon account of this di&s;tingui&s;hing quality, le&s;t it &s;hould follow that we are ju&s;tified <HI>by works!</HI> This (tho' we &s;hould not be uncharitable) looks too much as if the&s;e men were determined to &s;ay <HI>any thing;</HI> and even plainly to contradict <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> rather than not contradict the apo&s;tle when he &s;ays, that "a man is ju&s;tified by works, and not by faith only."</P>

4.

But if we con&s;ider faith in contradi&s;tinction from the&s;e virtues; and from all obedi|ence to God's commandments, no intel|ligible and rational account can be given of it; why it &s;hould have that prehemi|nence? why it &s;hould ju&s;tify? why it &s;hould be <HI>imputed for righteou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> But all this will be <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>my&s;tery;</HI> which, tho' accounted by &s;ome, the chief glory of the go&s;pel, &s;eems to me to be no real part of it's glory.

Even the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, who is tho't by &s;ome to exalt faith &s;o much, as to render every thing el&s;e incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on of it; even this &s;ame apo&s;tle undervalues faith

when put in competition with the moral virtues. "Tho' I have ALL FAITH, &s;ays he, and have not charity, I am NOTHING." And again, "Now abide&s;t faith, hope, charity, the&s;e three; but the GREATEST of the&s;e is CHARITY." And this is that <HI>more excellent</HI> way, which he &s;hews unto us, after exhorting us to "covet earne&s;tly the <HI>be&s;t gifts.</HI>" Thus St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the great champion for ju&s;tifica|tion by faith, undervalues &s;aith when con&s;idered in di&s;tinction from, and in compari&s;on of, virtue and obedience: Which plainly &s;hows, that when he &s;peaks of our being ju&s;tified by faith, he cannot mean faith, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from charity, and other chri&s;tian virtues; but as inclu|ding them.&mdash;As to the preheminence which &s;ome give to faith, in the affair of ju&s;tification, on account of its being <HI>the hand that lays hold</HI> on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and a <HI>going out of our&s;elves;</HI> the&s;e things, I confe&s;s, are beyond my compre|hen&s;ion: Only it were to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome people would not go out of their <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> as well as out of <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> and both amu&s;e <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and pe&s;ter <HI>others,</HI> with unmeaning phra&s;es, and mere <HI>Jargon.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus con&s;idered this notable <HI>di&s;tinction,</HI> (that tho' true faith includes a

principle of obedience; yet it does not ju&s;tify us con&s;idered as containing that principle, but exclu&s;ively of it, and as oppo&s;ed to it;) I &s;hall ju&s;t mention another, which is equally <HI>edifying;</HI> and which has, indeed, been already hinted at in this di&s;cour&s;e. The di&s;tinction I mean, is this, That tho' faith alone ju&s;ti|fies us in this world, and <HI>intitles</HI> us to &s;alva|tion in the world to come; yet obedience to the go&s;pel is nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified at Chri&s;t's tribunal here|after, and &s;o, in order to our being actual|ly &s;aved at la&s;t.</P>
<P>NOW if what is here &s;aid were indeed true, it would &s;carce be worth while to give our&s;elves much concern about the terms of ju&s;tification <HI>here;</HI> whether we are <HI>now</HI> ju&s;tified by faith alone, or not? This cannot be a very intere&s;ting and im|portant que&s;tion, provided it is certain that we mu&s;t <HI>both</HI> believe in Chri&s;t and obey Him, in order to our being <HI>finally</HI> ju&s;tified and &s;aved by Him, when he &s;hall come to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s. The grand intere&s;ting point, is, What the go&s;pel requires of us in order to our be|ing acquitted in that great day of retri|bution; and to our "going away into life eternal"? Which point being once re|&s;olved, the other is but of very little impor|tance.

It is rather a matter of curious &s;peculation for men of lei&s;ure, than of &s;erious concernment to the &s;ouls of Chri&s;|tians. So that there is either no founda|tion for this di&s;tinction; or, if there is, tho&s;e who make it might be much better employed in inculcating that piety and virtue, which is acknowledged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; than in eternally in&s;i&s;ting upon the doctrine of ju&s;tification <HI>here</HI> by faith <HI>only;</HI> as if there could be no chri&s;|tianity, no religion, without it!</P>
<P>BUT when this di&s;tinction comes to be examined, there is really nothing in it: it is wholly without foundation; and the thing intended by it, is demon&s;trably fal&s;e. We are not ju&s;tified here, and entitled to &s;alvation, on one condition; and ju&s;tified and actually &s;aved hereafter, on another; but on the &s;ame. That which the go&s;|pel has made nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being acquitted and &s;aved in the day of judgment, it has made equally nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being ju&s;tified now, and entitled to &s;alvation. For (as has been ob&s;erved already in this di&s;cour&s;e) the go&s;pel is the rule, by which tho&s;e who are under the di&s;pen&s;ation of it, are to be judged hereafter. So that we &s;hall then be either acquitted or condemned, ac|cording as we have, or have not, com|plied
<PB N="254" REF="007488_0259_102B91592A13F130">
with the terms of it according to their true intent and meaning, whatever tho&s;e terms are. And the&s;e terms being the &s;ame now that they will be hereafter, without the lea&s;t variation, it undeniably follows, that &s;uch per&s;ons as will be con|demned by the go&s;pel then, mu&s;t be e|qually condemned by it now; and that &s;uch as will then be ju&s;tified by it, and no others, can be ju&s;tified by it at pre|&s;ent, or intitled to the &s;alvation of it. Betwixt the ju&s;tification and condemna|tion of the go&s;pel, there is no medium. Whom it does not ju&s;tify, it condemns; whom it condemns not, it ju&s;tifies. Nor does length, or di&s;tance of time, make any alteration in this ca&s;e. We cannot be ju&s;tified only by believing, at pre&s;ent, unle&s;s we may be ju&s;tified only by be|lieving, hereafter; provided the terms of the go&s;pel, like the author of it, are "the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and forever:" So that what the&s;e men take for an impor|tant <HI>theological di&s;tinction,</HI> turns out (like &s;ome of St. <HI>Athana&s;ius'</HI>s) to be no better than a palpable <HI>contradiction.</HI> For there cannot well be a more glaring repugnan|cy than to &s;ay, that the &s;ame go&s;pel which will condemn men for their di&s;o|bedience in the day of judgment, does not al&s;o condemn men equally for their di&s;o|bedience

to <HI>Deity,</HI> and a <HI>moral Governor.</HI> The ancient pagan Morali&s;ts generally con&s;i|dered morality only in this light. When they teach that the law of rea&s;on, or the law of nature, is to be followed and ob|&s;erved, (on many branches of which, they treat with great propriety) they u&s;ually mean no more, than that men are bound to practice ju&s;tice, benevolence, &s;obriety, and the other virtues of private and &s;ocial life, as being, in their own nature, convenient, fitting and decent. This is a notion of virtue and obedience, which falls va&s;tly &s;hort of the Chri&s;tian idea; not only be|cau&s;e Chri&s;tians are under obligation to practice other duties be&s;ides tho&s;e which nature dictates; but al&s;o becau&s;e chri&s;ti|anity ultimately re&s;olves all duties into the will of God, con&s;idered as the all-wi&s;e, good, and righteous Lawgiver, and the moral Ruler of the world. "There is one Lawgiver, &s;ays St. <HI>James,</HI> who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy." And "He that &s;aid, do not commit adultery, &s;aid al&s;o, do not kill." Our obedience is, "doing the <HI>will</HI> of our Father which is in heaven." What|ever duty we are bound to practice, it is con&s;idered as injoined upon us by the authority of almighty God. All our good and virtuous actions, are con&s;idered as a tribute which we owe to Him; as a <HI>&s;a|crifice</HI>

For the divine will and authority, does, as it were, involve and &s;wallow up all other obligations; even the laws of nature and rea&s;on, as they are &s;ometimes called, being the laws of Him who is Lord of nature, and the Fountain of all rea&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT what has now been &s;aid, only di&s;tingui&s;hes the obedience of Chri&s;tians from &s;uch virtue as a mere <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> may, in &s;ome degree, be the &s;ubject of. For a man may be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ju&s;t, bene|ficent, temperate, &amp;c. from an internal &s;en&s;e of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and fitne&s;s and advantage of being &s;o; altho' he is &s;o far from obeying and honouring God there|in, that he does not even believe his exi&s;tence.

This is the <HI>characteri&s;tick</HI> of the obedience we are con&s;idering: hereby it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from any other.

<P>THE great <HI>principle</HI> of chri&s;tian obe|dience, is <HI>chri&s;tian faith;</HI> faith in Chri&s;t, and in God thro' him.

Chri&s;t came into the world in his Father's name, as &s;ent and commi&s;&s;ioned by Him, to declare and reveal Him. And in His name he &s;pake to the world con|cerning God, and His kingdom. All he taught, did and &s;uffered, refered ultimate|ly to the Father; the end thereof being to

<P>IT is very evident that no man can obey as a Chri&s;tian, who has not the faith of a Chri&s;tian.

But if a <HI>Mahometan</HI> or <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> known to be &s;uch, &s;hould per|form many of the&s;e duties, no one, &s;urely, would call this <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> obedience. Evan|gelical faith being wanting, there cannot,

properly &s;peaking, be any thing of evan|gelical obedience in any actions whatever.</P>
<P>SUCH faith in Chri&s;t, and in God thro' him, as is mentioned above, has a very natural and apparent <HI>tendency</HI> to make the &s;ubjects of it truly pious and virtuous; and to yield that obedience to the go&s;pel, which is required of them. As far as the belief of any thing; as far as any faith, in the primary and mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e of the term, can influence the tempers and practices of men; &s;uch a faith as I am &s;peaking of, bids the faire&s;t of any, to have a good influence upon men's hearts and manners; to turn them from &s;in to God; and to induce them to obey his commandments. What can be &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ufficient and effectual to this good end, if a belief of &s;uch truths as are re|vealed in the go&s;pel; if believing Chri&s;t to be really that divine me&s;&s;enger which he is &s;aid to be; if believing, that he came into the world to redeem us, according to the evangelical account of this matter; if believing in God, thro' him, believing in his righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s; his good|ne&s;s and mercy; his promi&s;es and threat|nings; what, I &s;ay, can be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uf|ficient and effectual to turn men from &s;in to righteou&s;ne&s;s, if &s;uch a faith as this, has not that influence and efficacy? if it leaves

&mdash;The account which the apo&s;tle gives us of &s;ome renowned men before the coming of Chri&s;t, (who&s;e faith was not e&s;&s;entially different from our's) is agreable to what is &s;aid above. <Q><HI>By faith,</HI> Mo&s;es, &s;ays he, when he was come to years, refu&s;ed to be called the &s;on of Pha|roah's daughter&mdash;<HI>By faith</HI> he for&s;ook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King; for he endured as <HI>&s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible</HI></Q>&mdash;"And what" (as the a|po&s;tle goes on) <Q>&s;hall I more &s;ay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samp&s;on, and of Jeptha, of David al&s;o and Samuel, and of the prophets; who <HI>thro' faith</HI> &s;ubdu|ed kingdoms, <HI>wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Thus was faith the great operative prin|ciple in good men, even before the com|ing of Chri&s;t: It was the &s;ame principle in general, which wrought in the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians: And it is this principle that operates in good men, in all &s;ucceding ages. This is the heavenly &s;eed, which taking root in the heart, &s;prings up, and ripens into good fruit: This is the &s;ource and fountain from whence obedience flows: And without &s;uch a principle of faith, there can, as has been ob&s;erved before, be no obedi|ence properly <HI>evangelical.</HI> But</P>

NOTWITHSTANDING the vi&s;ible, apparent tendency of faith, to produce o|bedience; to make men truly pious and virtuous; and altho' no per&s;on does, or can, obey the go&s;pel, but from this prin|ciple; yet it is manife&s;t both from &s;crip|ture, and daily ob&s;ervation, that people may be the &s;ubjects of faith, while they live in di&s;obedience to Chri&s;t's command|ments: They may have faith, without having their tempers and manners con|formed to the dictates of it: Their lives and practice may be contrary to what they profe&s;s to believe; yea, to what they actually do believe. So that tho' faith is the true principle of obedience, in all tho&s;e who obey; yet it is not, in fact and event, a principle of obedience in all that believe; for there are vicious be|lievers; as well as vicious infidels.

<P>IT is very evident then, that faith is not really a practical principle in the hearts of all <HI>believers:</HI> Some of them are very little, if any thing, the better for their faith&mdash;And there is one thing that de&s;erves a particular notice here: Which is, That the Apo&s;tles, in their epi&s;tles to particu|lar per&s;ons, or to chri&s;tian churches, ne|ver &s;peak of the <HI>vicious, impenitent</HI> profe&s;|&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, as being <HI>de&s;titute of true faith;</HI> or as being really <HI>unbelievers,</HI>

while they profe&s;&s;ed to have faith. On the contrary, they always take it for granted, that the&s;e per&s;ons, however wicked, were really believers notwith|&s;tanding their wickedne&s;s; exhorting them to repent and amend; and to live &s;uitably to their holy vocation. In this re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, there is a very remark|able difference betwixt the Apo&s;tles, and &s;ome modern preachers of the go&s;pel. The latter &s;peak to, and of, all the wick|ed profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, as unbelievers, as de&s;titute of <HI>true</HI> faith; upon a pre|&s;umption that where faith is, there will always be obedience; or, that no true believer, can remain vicious. Now I am bold to &s;ay, that this manner of preaching is altogether <HI>un&s;criptural;</HI> and that there cannot be a &s;ingle in&s;tance produced, from the writings of the apo&s;tles, which ju&s;ti|fies it. For, as was &s;aid before, They al|ways take it for granted, that men may be really <HI>believers,</HI> and addre&s;s them <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> how much &s;oever their lives and morals might re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>pagans</HI> and <HI>infidels.</HI> So that we cannot rea&s;onably doubt, but that faith, <HI>true faith,</HI> which is a principle of obedience in &s;ome per&s;ons, is not <HI>&s;o</HI> in others; not <HI>working by love,</HI> nor producing <HI>the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>SOME will probably inquire, How
<PB N="284" REF="007488_0289_102B919519C8BD10">
it comes to pa&s;s, that faith, which is the principle and &s;ource of obedience in &s;ome per&s;ons, &s;hould not be &s;o in others, uni|ver&s;ally? Why the hearts and manners of many &s;hould be influenced by their faith; while the hearts and manners of as many, perhaps a much greater num|ber, &s;hould be &s;o much at variance with their faith? &s;o oppo&s;ite to what they pro|fe&s;s to believe; and which they really do believe, according to the pre&s;ent hypothe|&s;is? And, indeed, tho' the po&s;&s;ibility of this, and the truth of the &s;uppo&s;ition, is evident from the whole current of &s;crip|ture, and verified by daily experience; yet it may well be accounted one of the greate&s;t &s;peculative difficulties that occurs, upon the &s;ubject of religion: And it is one, of which it is, perhaps, beyond the &s;phere of human under&s;tanding to give a clear and full &s;olution; &s;ince it &s;eems plainly to run up into the old que&s;tion concerning <HI>liberty;</HI> &s;o that They who can fully clear up all the difficulties attending the doctrine of human freedom, as op|po&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, can be at no lo&s;s for an an&s;wer to this&mdash;But who They are, I have not yet found&mdash;</P>
<P>SOME think this fact is &s;ufficiently ac|counted for, only by &s;uppo&s;ing that good and wicked men under the go&s;pel, (tho'

both of them are truly believers) believe in different degrees of inten&s;ene&s;s. There are doubtle&s;s degrees in faith; there is a &s;trong and lively faith, as well as a weak and languid. Tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of the former, it is &s;aid, are obedient to the dictates of it; faith, in them, becom|ing an operative, practical principle: Whil&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e faith is feeble and weak, do not give them&s;elves up to the guidance of it; this weak faith not being a practical principle, as the other is: But if it were &s;trengthened to a certain degree, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is &s;uppo&s;ed, it wou'd become &s;o; and certainly be productive of good fruit.&mdash;Thus, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, it comes to pa&s;s, that faith is actually a principle of obedi|ence in &s;ome per&s;ons, and not in others. But this is far from being a full &s;olution of the difficulty: For the que&s;tion &s;till occurs, how it comes to pa&s;s that &s;ome men are thus <HI>&s;trong in faith;</HI> while others give but a feeble and cold a&s;&s;ent to the great truths of chri&s;tianity? Be&s;ides, if there is any &s;uch thing as human liberty, it is certain that, of different men, who&s;e faith is the &s;ame, both for kind and degree, &s;ome may act agreably, others contrary thereto: And to &s;ay, that all men who&s;e faith is alike &s;trong, mu&s;t act alike, is, in effect, to deny that men are free creatures;

Liberty, as oppo&s;ed to nece&s;&s;ity, I take to be &s;omewhat of this kind. Great perplex|ities and difficulties ari&s;e upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of it; but much greater, upon the denial. All human language is exactly accommodated to the doctrine of freedom: &s;o that we could neither under&s;tand each other, nor our&s;elves, without the idea of liberty; or a power both of choo&s;ing and acting <HI>variou&s;ly,</HI> or <HI>differently,</HI> within a certain &s;phere, under the <HI>&s;ame</HI> given circum&s;tances. For this is the true, proper notion of liberty: At lea&s;t, this is the &s;en&s;e in which the terms <HI>liberty, freedom, active power,</HI> are u&s;ed in this note. And without the idea of &s;uch a power, what do we mean by &s;uch forms of expre&s;&s;ion as the&s;e, which are common? <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we can do &s;o or &s;o; but cannot do another thing: That we would do this or that, if we could; but cannot: And, <HI>vice vers&acirc;,</HI> That we could do this or that, if we would; but will not: That we will try, or u&s;e our endeavours to do &s;o or &s;o; and do it, if we can. This is the language of nature; and every man under&s;tands the&s;e forms of expre&s;&s;ion: Which, yet, would be quite &s;en&s;ele&s;s and unintelligible to us, without the idea and &s;uppo&s;ition of liberty. There would be no foundation for &s;uch a di&s;tinction betwixt what we can, and what we cannot do, &amp;c. All men have therefore the idea of liberty: which is, indeed, one of the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple of all our ideas: Even children have it. And</P>
<P>IT may be fairly argu'd that we are free, and con&s;cious to our&s;elves of our being &s;o, from our having this idea. For how did we, <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> come by it? It could not, I think, come into our minds, <HI>originally,</HI> from any thing external and material; or by means of any of our corporeal &s;en&s;es and or|gans. There &s;eems to be nothing in all vi&s;ible nature, which could &s;ugge&s;t it to us at fir&s;t; tho' &s;pontaneous animal motion bids the faire&s;t for it. If we had not actually experienced the thing our&s;elves, we could have no more idea of it, than a blind man, of colours, or a deaf one, of &s;ounds. This idea could be gotten only by reflecting upon what has pa&s;&s;ed in our own minds; upon what we have experienced in our&s;elves, by a kind of internal &s;en&s;ation. We are, therefore, <HI>con&s;cious</HI> of our freedom: So that tho&s;e who deny there is any liberty in man, do not only contradict the experience of others; but their own. For they have this idea, no le&s;s than others; which yet, they could not have, but from experience.</P>
<P>HOWEVER: If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that we do not get the idea of active power, by reflecting on our own experience; but that it might be <HI>naturally</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind <HI>ab extra,</HI> by animal motion, of which we are daily witne&s;&s;es; or by a|ny other phoenomena in nature: It will, even from hence follow, that there are really &s;ome phoenomena in nature, which corre&s;pond to this idea; for otherwi&s;e the idea could not have been <HI>naturally</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted to our minds by the&s;e appearances. So that, even upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it follows that the notion of liberty, or active power, is a <HI>natural</HI> one; bro't into our minds by daily ob&s;ervation. And if this is the ca&s;e, it is &s;urely <HI>natural</HI> to believe there is freedom: Con&s;equently to deny this, is <HI>unnatural;</HI> and to contradict a man's own daily ob&s;ervation. For we do not live a day without &s;eeing what has, at lea&s;t, the <HI>appearance</HI> of liberty; and what, according to the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, originally &s;ugge&s;ted to us the no|tion, or idea of it.</P>
<P>THERE is, demon&s;trably, liberty <HI>&s;omewhere;</HI> in &s;ome <HI>One</HI> Being, at lea&s;t. All things could not have proceeded in an eternal &s;eries of nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es and effects, each of which is both an effect with relation to &s;omewhat preceeding, and a cau&s;e with relation to &s;omething following. We mu&s;t a&s;cend, and follow the chain, 'till we come to a fir&s;t Mover, how di&s;|tant and remote &s;oever: Which fir&s;t Mover, mu&s;t be a free Being, or have a principle of active power, which is the &s;ame thing. He cannot be nece&s;&s;arily actuated by any thing: Which would be, in effect, to &s;uppo&s;e there is a Cau&s;e of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e; or that the fir&s;t Cau&s;e is a nece&s;&s;ary effect of ano|ther nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;e, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To deny to this great fir&s;t Cau&s;e, the power of imparting to his creatures a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of freedom; or of making a free creature, who can either chu&s;e and act, or not, within a certain &s;phere, (how narrow and limited &s;oever that &s;phere may be) is making much <HI>too free with Him.</HI> There is not the lea&s;t contradiction or ab&s;urdity, in the &s;uppo&s;ition of a creature's having active power, or being a <HI>free agent.</HI> And</P>
<P>IF active power be not an <HI>incommunicable</HI> attribute of the Creator; (which we have no rea&s;on to think it is) or if a creature may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> be endow'd with liberty; we have no rea&s;on to <HI>doubt</HI> but that we have it <HI>our&s;elves:</HI> Since, upon &s;up|po&s;ition that we were actually free, we could not be more <HI>experimentally</HI> certain that we were &s;o, than we are at pre&s;ent. That we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of active power, is &s;o immediately, &s;o experimentally known by us; and we have &s;uch an inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and feeling of it; that no difficulties, merely <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> can overthrow, or in any mea&s;ure invalidate, this evidence of it. We are not more certain of any one thing, ex|cept, perhaps, of our own exi&s;tence, than that we are free creatures.</P>
<P>BUT it will perhaps be &s;aid, that tho' we do, indeed, <HI>&s;eem</HI> to our&s;elves to be free; yet we may not <HI>really</HI> be &s;o: This may be all a delu&s;ion.&mdash;To which it is an&s;wered, that if this &s;hould in fact be the ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to know it to be &s;o; or to have any rea&s;on to think it &s;o; &s;ince we are as immediately and experimentally certain of our freedom, as we are of any one thing whatever, with the &s;ingle exception mentioned before. Tho&s;e notions and principles, which lead People to doubt of their freedom, mu&s;t in their own nature, be far more precarious than <HI>that</HI> is. We might as well call in que&s;tion the te&s;timony of any, or all of our &s;en&s;es, as doubt the truth and certainty of our experience in this ca&s;e; this con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of our freedom, I mean, whatever &s;peculative difficulties may lye in the way. We might as plau&s;ibly, at lea&s;t, que|&s;tion the exi&s;tence of an external, material world; que&s;tion whether we <HI>really</HI> &s;ee, hear, &s;mell, ta&s;te or feel, any thing; becau&s;e of the difficulties which occur re&s;pecting the <HI>modus</HI> of that communication and intercour&s;e, which there is betwixt <HI>body</HI> and <HI>mind:</HI> We might as plau&s;ibly, at lea&s;t, &s;ay, that tho' things <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be &s;o and &s;o; yet they may not be <HI>ready</HI> &s;o; but we be deluded by fal&s;e appearances: We might, I &s;ay, as plau&s;ibly talk thus, as call in que&s;tion the <HI>reality</HI> of our free|dom, becau&s;e we cannot clearly &s;ee <HI>how</HI> we can be free, con|&s;i&s;tently with &s;ome &s;peculative opinions; nor fully &s;olve all the difficulties ari&s;ing upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of our being &s;o. The <HI>former</HI> is not more certainly a matter of daily experience to us, than the <HI>latter:</HI> We are con&s;cious of, and feel, our freedom <HI>within</HI> us, as truly and certainly as we &s;ee or feel cor|poreal objects <HI>without</HI> us.</P>
<P>IF men will not re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;uch experience; but will &s;till doubt the truth of their own outward &s;en&s;es, and in|ternal con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; &s;aying, that tho' things <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be thus, yet they may not be &s;o in <HI>reality;</HI> there is no remedy&mdash;The&s;e are the faculties which the Author of our beings has given us: Nor have we any other way of coming to the truth, which is better than this, or even &s;o &s;ure and infallible. If the truth of the&s;e faculties, or the certainty of the te&s;timony which they bear, is called in que&s;tion, we are, of cour&s;e, reduced to a total ab&s;olute <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m;</HI> having no <HI>Data,</HI> no fir&s;t principles, on which to proceed in any ca&s;e whatever; whether with reference to religion, or common life: We may doubt of every thing, or believe any thing; even <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation</HI> will be no longer an ab&s;urdity, or incredible for the good old <HI>prote&s;tant rea&s;on,</HI> that it is a contradiction to <HI>experi|ence</HI> and <HI>common &s;en&s;e.</HI> For altho' all our &s;en&s;es <HI>&s;eem</HI> to con|tradict it; yet it <HI>may</HI> be really true&mdash;</P>
<P>CERTAINLY tho&s;e things, of which we have &s;uch an imme|diate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch an experimental knowledge, as is here intended, and as we actually have re&s;pecting our own freedom; ought not to be called in que&s;tion, upon any pre|tence of <HI>&s;peculative</HI> difficulties: Which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, and in their own nature, be more doubtful and precarious. We are to look upon the former as <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> (as they really are) from which if we once depart, we have ab&s;olutely no footing; no ground at all left to &s;tand upon; but are plunged into an aby&s;s, or endle&s;s labyrinth of doubts, from whence no clue can extricate us&mdash;And, indeed, what a <HI>paradox</HI> is this? that men &s;hould deny what they acknowledge <HI>&s;eems,</HI> even to them&s;elves, to be true from <HI>experience,</HI> on account of difficul|ties merely <HI>&s;peculative!</HI> This is the ca&s;e with relation to li|berty: For the&s;e men univer&s;ally confe&s;s, that they <HI>&s;eem</HI> to them&s;elves to be free.&mdash;This is &s;uch a degree of <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m;</HI> it is &s;uch <HI>infidelity</HI> to common-&s;en&s;e; &s;uch a want of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>tru&s;t</HI> therein, and to tho&s;e faculties which God has given us for the more immediate, and the mo&s;t infallible, guide of life; that one would think it impo&s;&s;ible, were there not examples of it! Moreover,</P>

<P>THE doctrine of liberty only accords naturally to that com|mon <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e of things, of actions and characters, which all mankind in all ages, in all countries, have had, and have: I mean, their &s;en&s;e of ill de&s;ert, and its contrary, both in them|&s;elves and others. It is indeed the notion or &s;uppo&s;ition of li|berty, (ever intimately pre&s;ent to the human mind, tho' &s;ome perver&s;ely di&s;own it: It is, I &s;ay, this idea of liberty) which partly con&s;titutes that moral &s;entiment, and internal feeling, which is here intended. All men know what <HI>peculiar</HI> &s;enti|ment <HI>that</HI> is, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the human mind, upon &s;eeing, or only hearing of, &s;ome remarkable in&s;tance of cruelty, inju&s;tice or perfidy. This &s;entiment (or, call it what you plea&s;e) is clo&s;e|ly connected with the notion of liberty: Or rather, the former cannot be, without the latter; which is really a con&s;tituent part of it. There is &s;ometimes indeed a momentary re&s;entment and anger, re&s;embling it, rai&s;ed in our brea&s;ts, even again&s;t inanimate, <HI>inactive</HI> beings. But we &s;oon check &s;uch re&s;entment by reflecting, that <HI>that</HI> at which we are angry, was inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ely pa&s;&s;ive, that it had no &s;elf moving, active principle; but was actuated in &s;ome manner, as to it&s;elf, quite unavoidable. This &s;ingle reflection, that the being, or thing, could not help, could not avoid what has happened, immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all re|&s;entment; tho' we may have received harm and damage there|from. Which &s;hows, that there is a clo&s;e, an intimate connexi|on, betwixt the ideas of <HI>blame-worthine&s;s</HI> and <HI>liberty;</HI> &s;o that the former cannot be without the latter, as was hinted before. Nor can a man calmly and cooly think any action really culpa|ble, or him that did it, of ill-de&s;ert, without pre&s;uppo&s;ing, that he was a free being: At lea&s;t no man can think &s;o, 'till he has <HI>made him&s;elf</HI> another <HI>kind</HI> of creature than God made him.</P>
<P>AND now, &s;ince the great Author of our being has framed our minds in &s;uch a manner, that we thus naturally connect the idea of liberty, with that of demerit, or ill-de&s;ert; &s;o that it is almo&s;t, if not altogether impo&s;&s;ible, to have the latter of them without the former; we may fairly conclude, that <HI>He Him&s;elf</HI> cannot re&s;ent, or be angry with his creatures for, any thing be&s;ides the abu&s;e, or the neglect, of their own freedom and active powers. Con&s;equently, He neither does, nor will puni&s;h them, properly &s;peaking, for the omi&s;&s;ion of that which they had no power to perform, or the doing of that which they could not forbear. We cannot be more certain that there is really a righteous moral government e&s;tabli&s;hed in the univer&s;e, than we are of this: We cannot even have the idea of &s;uch a con&s;titution, without taking this &s;uppo&s;ition along with us, our minds being moulded and fa&s;hioned as they are. And whether it becomes Us to attribute &s;uch a kind of proceeding to the Au|thor and Lord of all, as we all nece&s;&s;arily condemn in each other, under the names of <HI>cruelty, inju&s;tice, tyranny, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all are left to judge!&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT it is particularly to be ob&s;erved, that both the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> revelations, proceed wholly upon the &s;up|po&s;ition that men are free creatures. This point is never once brought into que&s;tion; but is always taken for granted: And upon this foundation the whole &s;uper&s;tructure of precepts, exhortations, promi&s;es and threatnings, is apparently built: Revelation, in this re&s;pect, exactly co-inciding with, and cor|re&s;ponding to, the natural &s;entiments, the common feelings of men's own brea&s;ts and con&s;ciences. So that human liberty is, in fact, the true ba&s;is of the moral con&s;titution of things; or God's moral government as di&s;tingui&s;hed from his natural: It is the ba&s;is of <HI>all religion,</HI> whether natural or revealed. And from hence it follows, that any &s;y&s;tem of principles which militates again&s;t this doctrine; or which cannot be &s;upported, but by the denial of it, mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily be fal&s;e;</HI> and (tho' chri&s;ten'd by the venerable name of <HI>religion</HI>) mu&s;t be a <HI>real contradiction to all religion.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if it could be truly &s;aid, (as it cannot) that Chri&s;tianity either a&s;&s;erts, or &s;uppo&s;es, men not to be free creatures; 'tis plain, Chri&s;tianity ought not to be credited. For we are more certain of this <HI>fact,</HI> that we are free, from daily <HI>experience;</HI> than we can be of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, in the way of <HI>in|ference, deduction,</HI> or <HI>rea&s;oning:</HI> Which rea&s;oning all mani|fe&s;tly depends on the truth of &s;ome <HI>hi&s;torical facts,</HI> of which we mu&s;t, in the nature of the thing, be le&s;s certain than we are of the <HI>other.</HI> No revelation, therefore, can po&s;&s;ibly over|throw the doctrine of human liberty: So far from this, that any pretended one which contradicts it, ought to be accounted an <HI>impo&s;ture,</HI> for that very rea&s;on. We could not <HI>rationally</HI> have been believers in Chri&s;t, without being fir&s;t believers in our own &s;en&s;es, had we been &s;pectators of his miracles; or, even the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of them, <HI>feeling in our bodies,</HI> that we were healed by him: (<HI>Mark</HI> 5. 29.) Nor can any man &s;et Chri&s;tianity at variance with the experience and feeling, with the <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of mankind; or exalt <HI>faith</HI> to triumph in their ruines; without being fir&s;t more truly an Enemy to <HI>them,</HI> than he is a Friend to religion afterwards&mdash;</P>
<P>WHAT good ends Chri&s;tians can propo&s;e to them&s;elves, e|ven in making it a <HI>que&s;tion,</HI> whether men have liberty or not? (which, &s;urely, is never made <HI>one</HI> in the holy &s;criptures) I am unable to conceive. But their attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h the nega|tive, is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing; unle&s;s they were &s;ure that they were right, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;take: For &s;hould they happen to be wrong, they cannot well be in&s;en&s;ible of the fatal mi&s;chiefs which may naturally follow, if they could per&s;wade people to believe, that they <HI>can chu&s;e and act no otherwi&s;e than they do;</HI> thus furni&s;hing them with a full and ample excu&s;e for all the impieties, and villanies, which they are either guilty of at pre&s;ent, or may have an inclination to commit! And how <HI>gravely</HI> &s;oever men may talk, or write, while they are en|deavouring to reconcile the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity with our daily experience; with our natural notions of virtue and vice, merit and demerit; with a righteous moral government, and with the religion of the <HI>Bible;</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s it appears to me, to be no better than <HI>formal, &s;olemn</HI> trifling upon a &s;ubject, which ought not to be trifled with! In &s;hort, if any &s;peculative prin|ciple can be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be contrary to the common &s;en&s;e, or &s;entiments, of mankind; to be immoral; to be impious; it is <HI>this,</HI> of an univer&s;al nece&s;&s;ity: For it really <HI>terminates</HI> in <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> if pur&s;ued in its ju&s;t and natural con&s;equences.</P>
<P>IT is, probably, a great while before men can bring them|&s;elves heartily to acquie&s;ce in this opinion: Common rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e greatly reluct at it. And if it ever &s;its quite ea&s;y upon peoples minds at la&s;t, it is becau&s;e their minds are, <HI>by &s;ome means or other,</HI> corrupted and debauched. Some per&s;ons, doubtle&s;s, have recour&s;e to this doctrine, as a <HI>&s;alvo</HI> for their vices; and that they may find re&s;t from a <HI>guilty con&s;cience.</HI> For this is a &s;hort, tho' not a wi&s;e and &s;afe method, for men to rid them&s;elves of the remon&s;trances and upbraidings of <HI>that</HI> offici|ous, trouble&s;ome companion: Tho' I would not, by any means, &s;ugge&s;t, that this is <HI>always</HI> the ca&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>OTHERS &s;eem to have embraced this doctrine, merely be|cau&s;e they tho't it follow'd from &s;ome <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> and <HI>anatomi|cal</HI> principles, which they had laid down, and were not willing to part with. Thus, particularly, a learned Phy&s;ician and Anatomi&s;t, who, not long &s;ince, wrote in defence of it, tells the world, That he had great reluctance at embracing it; be|cau&s;e it &s;eemed to him, at fir&s;t, to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the na|tural idea of vice and virtue, and the principles of religion; (in which he &s;eems to have been a &s;erious believer) However, he &s;ays, he found him&s;elf obliged to admit it, in con&s;equence of his <HI>hypothe&s;is</HI> concerning the <HI>vibratory</HI> motion of the <HI>nerves;</HI> the <HI>medullary</HI> &s;ub&s;tance; the <HI>&s;pinal</HI> marrow, &amp;c.!</P>
<P>IF &s;ome other Gentlemen had, with equal plainne&s;s and hone&s;ty, declared to the world their rea&s;ons for embracing this doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity, it is probable they would have &s;aid, "It was becau&s;e they were <HI>re&s;olved,</HI> at all adventures, to defend <HI>their (religion,</HI> &s;hall I call it? or <HI>irreligious?) hypothe&s;is;</HI> which they knew not how to defend well without it." How|ever, <HI>That &s;y&s;tem of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">heology</HI> is, perhaps, as indefen&s;ible with, as without this doctrine: Since it is, hereby, weakened and pulled down <HI>in &s;ome re&s;pects,</HI> in the &s;ame proportion that it is &s;trengthened and built up in <HI>others.</HI> The doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity, if true, would, indeed afford a &s;olution of &s;ome of the diffi|culties re&s;pecting fore-knowledge, prede&s;tination, and <HI>Their me|chanical</HI> conver&s;ion: But if the&s;e Gentlemen de&s;ign, in <HI>Their &s;y&s;tem</HI> to vindicate the <HI>moral</HI> Character of God, and the equity of his dealings; particularly in con&s;igning the <HI>wicked</HI> to endle&s;s torments, <HI>rather</HI> than the <HI>holie&s;t</HI> man on earth, or <HI>angel</HI> in heaven; if this, I &s;ay, is ready <HI>any part</HI> of their de&s;ign, they are &s;o far from receiving any help at all, in this re&s;pect, (wherein they needed &s;o much) from the doctrine I am &s;peaking of; that <HI>that</HI> which was before their <HI>grand difficulty,</HI> is heighten'd, hereby, into an <HI>ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility</HI>&mdash;For</P>
<P>IT is to no purpo&s;e for the&s;e Gentlemen to tell us, That <HI>vicious</HI> men are <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> puni&s;hed, becau&s;e they are not actuated by a foreign, <HI>external</HI> con&s;traint; but will, and chu&s;e to &s;in, and do it voluntarily: Which is the method in which &s;ome of them have endeavoured to vindicate the divine ju&s;tice in the perdition of the wicked. This is equally eva&s;ive and futile. For what they call <HI>willing</HI> and <HI>chu&s;ing</HI> to &s;in, and doing &s;o <HI>vo|luntarily,</HI> is either that which the &s;inner might have avoided, or that which he could not avoid: Let them <HI>chu&s;e</HI> their alter|native If they &s;ay, this was avoidable; then the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity is given up: If, unavoidable; then the objection a|gain&s;t puni&s;hing the &s;inner for it, remains in its full &s;trength: For if the &s;inner (it &s;eems we <HI>mu&s;t &s;till call him &s;o!</HI>) could not po&s;&s;ibly have avoided thus <HI>willing, chu&s;ing,</HI> and acting; but was, in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive moment of his exi&s;tence, even from the fir&s;t, laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing ju&s;t as he did; whether this were owing to any <HI>external</HI> con&s;traint, or to &s;ome <HI>internal, o|riginal</HI> bya&s;s, or impul&s;e of <HI>nature;</HI> makes not the lea&s;t altera|tion in the ca&s;e, &s;o far as divine ju&s;tice is concerned in it.

<P>SOME, by faith, which they call a prin|ciple of obedience, &s;eem evidently to in|tend believing, together with that repen|tance; that humble and pious temper of &s;oul, which is the fruit of God's &s;pirit, co|operating with our &s;incere de&s;ires to obey and &s;erve him: <HI>i. e</HI> they mean internal goodne&s;s and holine&s;s, as well as &s;aith.

<P>THE <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> of evan|gelical obedience having been con|&s;idered in the forgoing di&s;cour&s;e; we are now to con&s;ider the <HI>extent</HI> of it; and to give a &s;hort de&s;cription thereof, as it is found in good men, who are the heirs of &s;alvation.

<P><PB N="309" REF="007488_0314_102B91C5523CF9D0">
I HAVE, more e&s;pecially, two rea&s;ons for &s;peaking of the <HI>extent</HI> of chri&s;tian o|bedience; and giving a &s;hort de&s;cription of it, as it is actually found in the hearts and lives of Chri&s;t's true di&s;ciples. One is, that they who are <HI>really</HI> chri&s;tians, and not only <HI>nominally</HI> &s;uch, may have the great and ble&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction of know|ing that this character belongs to them; and &s;o may rea&s;onably <HI>hope for the mer|cy of God unto eternal life;</HI> being &s;till excited by this very hope, to purify them|&s;elves yet more; to make farther progre&s;s in piety and virtue; and to <HI>perfect holi|ne&s;s in the fear of God.</HI>&mdash;The other end which I have in view, is, that tho&s;e who are not truly <HI>doers of the word,</HI> may not <HI>deceive their own &s;elves;</HI> that they may not hope to be <HI>ble&s;&s;ed in their deed;</HI> but may know wherein they fall &s;hort of what is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the chri&s;ti|an character; and &s;o be excited to amend their ways, 'till they come up thereto.</P>
<P>THESE two ends may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be both attained by laying before you the chri&s;tian rule of life and conduct, (by which we are to be judged hereafter) in order to your comparing your own tempers and manners therewith. Tho&s;e who&s;e hearts and manners corre&s;pond to this law of liberty, (allowing for &s;uch de|viations
<PB N="310" REF="007488_0315_102B91C732870B18">
as may properly come under the head of human infirmities) may ju&s;tly have confidence towards God; and <HI>a&s;&s;ure their hearts before Him.</HI> On the other hand, tho&s;e who&s;e own hearts condemn them, as being pre&s;umptuous, wilful tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors of this <HI>law of liberty,</HI> may be equally &s;ure that they are not heirs to the ble&s;&s;ings annexed to the ob&s;ervance, but to the condemnation annexed to the vio|lation, of it. The go&s;pel, as it is a rule of life to us, and as we behold the glory and perfections of God therein, is a &s;ort of &s;piritual fountain, or intellectual mirrour; by looking into which, we may di&s;cern the true features and lineaments of our &s;ouls. In this it is, that the good man may di&s;cover the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s</HI> (the di|vine image) in him&s;elf, as it were by re|flexion from it: It will give him back, and make him &s;ee, his own likene&s;s; his <HI>o|ther &s;elf:</HI> And, at the &s;ame time that it &s;hews him all that is truly beautiful and amiable in his <HI>inner man,</HI> it will al&s;o &s;hew him, wherein <HI>that</HI> &s;till needs poli&s;hing and adorning.

and undivided, to God thro' Chri&s;t; &s;o as to be internally di&s;po&s;ed to yield obe|dience to all his known commandments. There is no true principle of chri&s;tian piety and goodne&s;s in the heart, but what is an univer&s;al one; not confined to this, or the other precept and duty, but extended to all of them in general. This will be e|vident to any one, who attentively con|&s;iders what is implied in a principle of o|bedience to God, and of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority. For this is really a principle uniform, and con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, thro'|out. He that truly loves virtue, as being what it is, loves it univer&s;ally; tho' a man may in many ca&s;es put on the appearance of it, without really loving it at all. So he that truly loves God, and reverences his authority, as &s;uch, reverences it uni|ver&s;ally, &s;o as to have a temper of mind di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit, in all re&s;pects, to the divine will, without re&s;erve or limita|tion. In this re&s;pect, there is a wide difference betwixt a due principle of obe|dience to God's will, as di&s;covered to us in the go&s;pel of his Son, and a principle of obedience to any human authority, whether civil or parental. No one but God, has an ab&s;olute, unlimited authority over us. We may therefore (and indeed ought to) have re&s;erves in our brea&s;ts,

or limitations? and that God's holy will and commands, as made known to us in the go&s;pel, are the only mea&s;ure and &s;tandard of that obedience which is truly chri&s;tian? Is it not incongruous to imagine, that we can really reverence the divine authority, with reference to <HI>any</HI> of the divine commandments, without doing &s;o as to <HI>all</HI> of them? The &s;ame principle of love, reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to God and our Saviour, which is even nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a truly chri&s;tian obedience to any one commandment; mu&s;t and will run thro', and take place with re|ference to the whole divine law; to all points and branches of it.

His Lord&s;hip tells us, that that interpretation <Q>amounts to this: All laws are founded upon one and the &s;ame authori|ty of God; therefore every offence again&s;t any law, is a contempt of the authority upon which all laws depend; and therefore every act of di&s;obedience, is a breach of the whole law.&mdash;To tho&s;e who have plain &s;en&s;e, and can fol|low it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ays, this mu&s;t appear ab&s;urd: And that the true and natural interpretation,</Q> is to be collected from the new-te&s;tament <Q>Notion of love, as being the fulne&s;s of the law, and of all the commandments being comprehended in this &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI></Q> And when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, that <HI>who&s;oever offends in one point, is guilty of all;</HI> his Lord&s;hip tells us, that <Q>in this ver&s;e, he con|&s;iders the royal law, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour,</HI> &amp;c. as the whole law.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip judges, that the common interpretation is <Q>evidently liable to all the difficulties of the <HI>Stoic'</HI>s paradox that all offences are equal&mdash;So that there will be no dif|ference between killing your neighbour and your neighbour's hor&s;e; for he that has forbid you killing your neighbour, has likewi&s;e forbid you doing any act to the hurt and detri|ment of your neighbour.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip &s;ays farther, that <Q>the apo&s;tle's inference in the latter part of the ver&s;e [i. e. ver. 11.] does not an&s;wer to the principle laid down in the former,</Q> in the common method of interpretation. <Q><HI>He that &s;aid do not commit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ultery, &s;aid al&s;o do not kill.</HI> This is his principle: And he infers, <HI>Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art be|come a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law</HI>&mdash;But what is this towards &s;howing that the breach of one law, is the breach of all?</Q></P>

<P>HIS Lord&s;hip, interpretation &s;eems as <Q>evidently liable to all the difficulties of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> paradox,</Q> as the old one.

So that it &s;eems to be as true according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as it is according to the <HI>other</HI> interpretation, that there is <Q>no difference between killing your neighbour and your neighbour's hor&s;e</Q>: For that law of charity which &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill thy neighbour,</HI> &s;ays al&s;o. <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill thy neighbour's hor&s;e:</HI> And the <HI>whole</HI> of this law, his Lord&s;hip tells us, is actually broken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, who <Q>offends in any <HI>one</HI> point of charity or duty.</Q>&mdash;But if any think the <HI>Stoic'</HI>s paradox may be avoided here, by &s;aying, that tho' any parti|cular offence again&s;t our neighbour is a breach upon the whole law of charity; yet the nature and circum&s;tances of &s;ome of|fence, may render them more criminal than others. Why may not the &s;ame paradox be al&s;o avoided, in the old way, by &s;aying, that tho' every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is, in a &s;ort, the violation of all God's law in general, as it is a violation of that <HI>one</HI> ge|neral authority, on which all laws depend; yet the nature and circum&s;tances of &s;ome &s;ins again&s;t this one great authority, may render them more heinous than others? <Q>To <HI>&s;ome</HI> men who have plain &s;en&s;e, and can follow it,</Q> there will, per|haps, appear no more <HI>ab&s;urdity</HI> in this latter method of &s;olving the difficulty, &s;o far as it relates to the <HI>&s;toical</HI> paradox, than there will appear in the former.</P>
<P>AND tho' his Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that <Q>the apo&s;tle's inference in the latter part of the [11th] ver&s;e, does not an&s;wer to the principle laid down in the former,</Q> in the old way of interpretation; I mu&s;t beg leave to think it an&s;wers as well thereto, in this, as in his Lord&s;hip's interpretation: Tho' One would not di&s;&s;ent from &s;uch an acknowledged ma&s;ter of rea&s;on and critical learning, but with caution and diffidence. This 11th ver&s;e evidently contains the grounds of the a&s;&s;ertion in the preceeding ver&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That who&s;oever offend, in one point is guilty of all</HI> [points.] And con&s;idered in this light, the meaning of the inference. <HI>Thou art become a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law,</HI> mu&s;t be this, Thou art a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> law, &s;o as to make thee <HI>guilty of all;</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed ver. 10. This is the de&s;ign of the argument, both in his Lord&s;hip's method of interpretation, and in the other; it is common to them: Only his Lord&s;hip confines the words, <HI>guilty of all,</HI> to the great law of charity; the per&s;on &s;poken of, is guilty of break|ing that <HI>whole</HI> law, tho' not of all laws in general. And a|greably hereto, his Lord&s;hip, by a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law, ver. 11. under&s;tands <Q>a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of this <HI>whole</HI> law, <HI>Thou &s;halt love,</HI></Q> &amp;c. So that in both methods of interpretation, the inference in the latter part of ver. 11, mu&s;t an&s;wer, not only to the principle laid down in the former part; but al&s;o corre&s;pond to the Propo&s;ition to be proved, <ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> that he who offends in <HI>one</HI> point is guilty of <HI>all</HI> (points.) And the que&s;tion is, How this inference an&s;wers better, either to the principle in the for|mer part of the ver&s;e, (which is the medium to prove the pro|po&s;ition,) or to the propo&s;ition it&s;elf, upon his Lord&s;hip's hypo|the&s;is, than upon the old. Upon the old one the argument &s;tands thus, The one great Lawgiver, on who&s;e authority all laws depend; and who has &s;aid, Do not commit adultery, has &s;aid al&s;o do not kill: Therefore, if thou do&s;t not commit adultery, but yet kille&s;t, thou art a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of his whole law; &s;o that thou art <HI>guilty of all</HI> [points] thereof; <HI>i. e.</HI> as thou violate&s;t that one authority which extends equally to all points. If the inference does not an&s;wer to the principle, (or medium) or to the propo&s;ition to be proved, in this way: Let us &s;ee, whether it an&s;wers to either of them any better, in his Lord|&s;hip's. Upon his hypothe&s;is, the thing to be proved is, That who&s;oever offends <HI>again&s;t his neighbour</HI> in one point, breaks the <HI>whole</HI> law of charity; or is <HI>guilty of all</HI> [points of that royal law.] The principle or medium of proof (in his Lord&s;hip's tran&s;lation) is this&mdash;"<HI>For the law which &s;aid,</HI>" &amp;c. And the argument, I humbly conceive, mu&s;t &s;tand thus&mdash;The &s;ame royal law which <Q>has forbid you killing your neighbour, has likewi&s;e forbid you doing any act to the hurt and detriment of your neighbour</Q>: Therefore if thou do&s;t not kill thy neighbour; but yet injure&s;t him in any <HI>one</HI> re&s;pect, thou art become a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of this <HI>whole</HI> law of charity; &s;o that thou art <HI>guilty of all</HI> [points] thereof; <HI>i. e.</HI> as thou violate&s;t that one royal law, which extends equally to all points of &s;ocial duty and benevolence. This is evidently the true &s;tate of the argument, upon his Lord&s;hip's hypothe&s;is; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not able to &s;ee, that the inference an|&s;wers any better, either to the principle, (or the medium of proof) or to the propo&s;ition to be proved, in this method of interpretation, than it does in the old. If it does not follow, that becau&s;e all laws depend upon one and the &s;ame authority of God, therefore he who tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth one law, is a tran&s;gre&s;|&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> law, or <HI>guilty of all</HI> [points;] it &s;eems not to follow, that becau&s;e all particular &s;ocial duties are compre|hended in one and the &s;ame law of charity, therefore he who tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth one branch of that law, is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> of it, or is guilty of all [points] thereof. There &s;eems to be as much "occa&s;ion for niceties and di&s;tinctions" in one ca&s;e, as there is in the other.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip judges, that his tran&s;lation "<HI>For the law which &s;aid,</HI>" in&s;tead of&mdash;<HI>For he that &s;aid,</HI> removes the difficul|ty which there is, otherwi&s;e, in this pa&s;&s;age. However he candidly allows, that <Q>the words in the original are of doubt|ful interpretation;</Q> as they certainly are. And &s;ince the term <HI>law,</HI> is not in the original; and the <HI>Greek</HI> participle may be as well referred to that <HI>One Lawgiver,</HI> expre&s;ly mentioned by St. <HI>James</HI> in this epi&s;tle, as to the law it&s;elf, whether the <HI>royal law,</HI> or the law in its utmo&s;t extent and latitude; there &s;eems to be no real nece&s;&s;ity for departing from the common tran&s;lation. But admitting his Lord&s;hip's tran&s;lation to be pre|ferable, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee, how this helps the matter in any degree. For what is the law? or what can it &s;ay, con&s;idered independently of the will and authority of the <HI>One Law-giver?</HI> Thus ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, it lays us under no <HI>obligation:</HI> nor can it be broken in a moral or religious &s;en&s;e. It is only <HI>ink</HI> and <HI>paper,</HI> if written; only <HI>&s;ound,</HI> if articulately pronounced;&mdash;even tho' pronounced in <HI>Thunder,</HI> as at <HI>Sinai.</HI> So that tho' the true <HI>critical</HI> rendering were, "<HI>For the law which &s;aid,</HI>" &amp;c. as his Lord&s;hip judges it is; yet we are obliged to recur to the will and authority of the Law-giver; and to con&s;ider <HI>Him</HI> as &s;peaking to us in and by the law. The law, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is only the will of the Legi&s;lator, in &s;ome way or o|ther made known to us: And this equally, whether the royal law of charity <HI>only,</HI> be intended by St. <HI>James,</HI> or the <HI>whole</HI> law of God in general. So that tho' his Lord&s;hip's tran&s;lation were received; yet this would not, I humbly conceive, in any degree, tend to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;en&s;e of the apo&s;tle's doctrine, or to overthrow the common. This &s;eems to be no more than a <HI>verbal</HI> critici&s;m; which cannot, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, (tho' it might in many others) make the lea&s;t alteration in the &s;en&s;e and true de&s;ign of the writer: Settle this point how you will, either one way or the other; yet the re&s;ult will be exactly the &s;ame at la&s;t.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be added, (becau&s;e his Lord&s;hip lays &s;tre&s;s upon it) that tho' St. <HI>James</HI> is certainly &s;peaking, in the preceeding context, more directly concerning the great law of charity and the &s;ocial duties; yet this does not &s;eem to be a &s;ufficient ground for under&s;tanding him in the 10th and 11th ver&s;es, as &s;peak|ing of that royal law, and of the&s;e duties, <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> of others. The rea&s;oning here, may be naturally extended to all other laws, all other branches of duty; and &s;till be as good and conclu&s;ive, as if it were re&s;trained to the law and duties of charity. And there is, perhaps, as truly a connexion betwixt all chri&s;tian vir|tues in general, &s;o that they may be re&s;olved into <HI>one,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> love and reverence</HI> to the <HI>One great and good Law-giver</HI> as there is a connexion betwixt all the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> virtues, &s;o that they may be re&s;olved into that <HI>one,</HI> of <HI>loving our neighbour as our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>UPON the whole; whatever of difficulty, or paradox, there is in this pa&s;&s;age, in the old method of interpretation, it &s;eems evidently to <HI>remain</HI> in his Lord&s;hip's. For it is particularly to be ob&s;erved, (tho' his Lord&s;hip has not mentioned it) That when a man who tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth in <HI>one</HI> point, is &s;aid to be guilty of all; the word <HI>all</HI> is <HI>plural</HI> in the original; and &s;o cannot naturally be refered to any <HI>one</HI> general law. It is u&s;ed in op|po&s;ition to the <HI>one point,</HI> or <HI>one re&s;pect,</HI> in the preceeding clau&s;e: And the obvious con&s;truction is, that who&s;oever of|fends thus in <HI>one</HI> point, is (<HI>in &s;ome &s;en&s;e or other</HI>) guilty in <HI>all</HI> points. The grand difficulty really lies here: And this, I humbly conceive, is not, in any mea&s;ure, le&s;&s;ened by his Lord&s;hip's ob&s;ervations. For tho' you admit his propo&s;ed emendation in the ver&s;ion; tho' you admit all which he &s;ays upon the context; tho' you allow, that St. <HI>James</HI> is &s;peaking only of that royal law of charity; (which extends to all points of &s;ocial duty, and prohibits all kinds of injury to your neigh|bour) tho' you conceed all this, &s;till the que&s;tion returns, Why, or in <HI>what &s;en&s;e,</HI> he who offends in <HI>one</HI> point of this great <HI>royal law,</HI> mu&s;t needs be a trangre&s;&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> of that law? or quality as to <HI>all</HI> points thereof? This remains as much a difficulty, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the great law of charity only, is here treated of; as it is upon the old &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of God's law in general All God's laws may be con&s;idered as <HI>one general</HI> law, con&s;i&s;t|ing of various points, or branches; as well as all the particu|lar laws of ju&s;tice and charity, may be reduced to that one, royal law, <HI>Thou &s;halt love,</HI> &amp;c. Nor has the apo&s;tle's rea&s;on|ing, ver. 11. any more obvious a tendency to prove, (on his Lord&s;hip's &s;uppo&s;ition) that he who offends in <HI>one</HI> point of the general law of love, is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> of that law, or guilty of <HI>all;</HI> than it has to prove, (on the other &s;uppo&s;i|tion) that he who offends in <HI>one</HI> point of God's general, uni|ver&s;al law, is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the whole of that law, or guilty of <HI>all.</HI> The rea&s;oning, I humbly conceive, receives no ad|ditional clearne&s;s, weight or cogency, by &s;uch a change of the &s;uppo&s;ition. For there is &s;till a general law, con&s;i&s;ting of in|numerable <HI>parts,</HI> or <HI>branches,</HI> the <HI>whole</HI> of which, it is &s;aid, is broken, by him that offends in <HI>one</HI> point of it. And whether it were <HI>The law,</HI> which &s;aid, or the <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> which &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not,</HI> &amp;c. this makes not, &s;o far as I am able to &s;ee, the lea&s;t alteration in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT which makes this pa&s;&s;age appear &s;o paradoxical as it does to many, is a palpable mi&s;take of St <HI>James'</HI>s &s;en&s;e; in &s;uppo&s;ing him to a&s;&s;ert &s;omething which he does not; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that offending in <HI>one</HI> point, or as to one particular law, is what <HI>makes, renders,</HI> or <HI>con&s;titutes</HI> a man guilty with reference to all others; or <Q>that an offence again&s;t one law, is a breach of all laws, however different they are in kind or degree.</Q> This would, indeed, be rather a contradiction than a paradox; and equally &s;o, whether &s;aid only with reference to the vari|ous points of the <HI>royal law</HI> of love; or to the various branches of God's law in general. But the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts no &s;uch thing as either. He a&s;&s;erts only, that the man who thus offends in <HI>one</HI> point <HI>is</HI> [really] guilty of all; and that he <HI>is</HI> a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the [whole] law: Which is quite a different thing from &s;aying, that <HI>in that very act,</HI> by which a man offends again&s;t one precept, he offends again&s;t all the re&s;t. Let us therefore keep to the very words of the apo&s;tle&mdash;"He <HI>is</HI> guilty of all" But how? in what &s;en&s;e guilty? Certainly he does not <HI>exter|nally</HI> di&s;obey all the laws of God: For the &s;ame man is &s;up|po&s;ed, in the former part of the ver&s;e, to keep the <HI>whole</HI> law, [outwardly] with <HI>one</HI> &s;ingle exception&mdash;Now look to the 26th ver. of the preceeding chapter; and there you will find a &s;ure and ea&s;y clue to the apo&s;tle's meaning: <HI>If any man among you &s;eem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, that man's reli|gion is vain.</HI> Offending in that <HI>one</HI> point, or giving a wicked licence to the tongue, is a proof that <HI>all</HI> a man's religion is vain; however religious he may <HI>&s;eem</HI> to him&s;elf or others to be: Yea tho' he <HI>&s;eem</HI> to keep the <HI>whole</HI> law in other re&s;pects, he <HI>deceiveth his own heart;</HI> and is guilty with reference to <HI>all</HI> the commandments: For &s;ince &s;uch a man does not truly and piou&s;ly ob&s;erve <HI>any</HI> of the commandments; but his religion is all <HI>vain;</HI> certainly he is guilty in all points; or with relation to all the commandments. For there is really no medium be|twixt <HI>truly</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> keeping the commandments, and <HI>really</HI> breaking them. Such a man is, therefore, guilty of <HI>all;</HI> a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the <HI>whole</HI> law. Tho' he does not tran&s;gre&s;s the whole, BY offending in <HI>one</HI> point; (which it were ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e) yet his thus offending in <HI>one</HI> point, is a proof and e|vidence of his being wicked and hypocritical at the bottom. And an evil and wicked heart is more properly a contradiction to, and a <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> of, all God's commandments; than any external conformity thereto, without a pious, good heart, is <HI>obedience</HI> to them.</P>
<P>FOR the farther illu&s;tration of this pa&s;&s;age, it is to be ob&s;erv|ed, That, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oting of <HI>mere</HI> law, any &s;ingle deviation, tho' but for a moment, and in the lea&s;t point, would render a man a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of that <HI>whole</HI> convenant of works; or of that whole law. The whole law in this ca&s;e would be, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e <HI>one;</HI> [<HI>one</HI> covenant:] that it mu&s;t be either <HI>wholly</HI> kept, or <HI>wholly</HI> violated, by every per&s;on under it. There could be no medium here. Such a <HI>unity</HI> is of the very nature and e&s;&s;ence of a di&s;pen&s;ation merely <HI>legal.</HI> But the apo&s;tle is here &s;peak|ing to Chri&s;tians, upon chri&s;tian principles; the principles of evangelical grace. And tho' he u&s;es the terms <HI>law,</HI> in the 10th and 11th ver&s;es; yet he means the chri&s;tian law, as contradi&s;|tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> covenant of works: This he calls <HI>the law of liberty,</HI> ver. 12. And there is really &s;uch an <HI>unity</HI> even in this covenant of grace al&s;o, that it mu&s;t be either <HI>wholly</HI> kept, or <HI>wholly</HI> broken, by each man that is under it. This appears from the condition of it, on our part: Which is <HI>faith,</HI> in that comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e in which the word is often u&s;ed in &s;cripture; <HI>i. e.</HI> as including uprightne&s;s of heart to|wards God; which every man is either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, or not. So that every man either <HI>wholly</HI> keeps, or <HI>wholly</HI> breaks this covenant of grace. This uprightne&s;s, or &s;incerity towards God, is oppo&s;ed to <HI>perfection</HI> on one hand; and <HI>both</HI> to <HI>re|fined hypocri&s;y,</HI> and to <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> &s;inning, on the other. It is the <HI>medium</HI> betwixt them. No &s;incere chri&s;tian is perfect; no one is an habitual tran&s;gre&s;&s;or in any one point. The former is incompatible to the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of mankind; the latter is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;incerity towards God; or with faith, in that &s;en&s;e of the term before alluded to. And the&s;e things being con&s;idered, the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age will, I con|ceive, be intelligibly expre&s;&s;ed; and the rea&s;oning of the a|po&s;tle &s;et in a true and convincing light, in the following <HI>paraphra&s;e</HI> of the 10th and 11th ver&s;es, <HI>q d.</HI> Who&s;oever &s;hall <HI>externally</HI> ob&s;erve the whole go&s;pel rule of life, excepting in one point, wherein he knowingly and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly offends; tho' he may <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be religious, yet that man is certainly de|&s;titute of &s;incere piety to God; his religion is <HI>vain;</HI> he <HI>decei|veth</HI> his own Heart. This is an evidence that he obeys <HI>none</HI> of the commandments in a truly chri&s;tian manner; and there|fore, that he is guilty with re&s;pect to <HI>all</HI> of them in general. For remember, that the &s;ame great Lawgiver, who forbids murder, forbids adultery al&s;o; and His commands, you know, are equally obligatory in all ca&s;es: So that who&s;oever truly knows and loves Him, and &s;incerely reverences his au|thority, will have no re&s;erves, but pay a &s;acred regard to all his commandments. And therefore, tho' you &s;hould not actually commit adultery, in the common <HI>gro&s;s</HI> &s;en&s;e; yet if you commit murder, or live in the practice of any other known &s;in; this proves you to be &s;uch contem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of God and his authority, as cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed truly, and in a chri&s;tian manner, to ob&s;erve any of his laws, however you may flatter your&s;elves. And if you do not properly ob&s;erve any of them, you mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be adjudged tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the <HI>whole</HI> chri&s;tian law; and guilty, in a greater or le&s;s degree, with reference to all points of your duty in general. Sincerity and piety towards God, being wanting, you are nothing; and are cut off from all rea&s;onable hopes of &s;alvation, even tho' you are under the merciful covenant of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I HAVE been the longer in endeavouring to &s;how the true &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age, and wherein the force of St. <HI>James'</HI>s rea|&s;oning lies; becau&s;e I conceive this to be a point of real im|portance.

Piety and virtue, or evangelical holine&s;s, is a <HI>uniform</HI> character. No man can be habitually pious in &s;ome re&s;pects, and yet habitually impious in others: No man can truly love virtue, as &s;uch, in &s;ome in|&s;tances,
<PB N="335" REF="007488_0340_102B91FFE5F3CE18">
without loving it in all. He may, indeed, do many pious and virtuous ac|tions, if you con&s;ider them externally; and view only the &s;urfaces of things: But <HI>God looketh at the heart;</HI> and while <HI>that</HI> re|mains rebellious to <HI>one</HI> commandment, God accounts the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, as he real|ly is, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, <HI>guilty of all.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole: A truly good man pre&s;umes not to &s;ay in his heart, "<HI>The&s;e</HI> commandments will I keep, becau&s;e I can do &s;o, without much trouble or incon|venience to my&s;elf; but <HI>that</HI> other I will di&s;obey, becau&s;e it is irk&s;ome to fle&s;h and blood; and requires great &s;elf-denial." This is evidently the language of &s;tub|borne&s;s and rebellion; 'tis the language of an heart un&s;ubdued to the authority of God; an heart unanimated with love and gratitude to Chri&s;t; an heart un&s;anctified by the Holy Spirit; and therefore <HI>un&s;ealed to the day of redemption.</HI> The language of a truly good man's heart, is this,&mdash;"O my God! O my Redeemer, and Saviour! I am not mine own, but bought with a price: Therefore will I be <HI>wholly</HI> thine; I will glorify God in my body and in my &s;pirit which are his; I will do nothing which thou ha&s;t forbidden; I will re|nounce every lu&s;t however dear: I will, by thy grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>walk in all thy
<PB N="336" REF="007488_0341_102B9201CE554FC0">
commandments and ordinances blamele&s;s.</HI>"&mdash;He that has not &s;uch a principle of univer|&s;al, unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God and his Redeemer, rooted in his heart; has <HI>none</HI> that is <HI>truly chri&s;tian:</HI> But he is &s;till <HI>alienated from the life of God thro' the ig|norance that is in him, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of his heart.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hown, That chri&s;tian piety and virtue is a uniform, univer&s;al principle in the heart, extending it&s;elf to <HI>all</HI> the precepts of the go&s;pel; &s;o that who|&s;oever truly obeys in one in&s;tance does &s;o in all in&s;tances; and who&s;oever di&s;obeys habitually in one re&s;pect, is, in a &s;en&s;e, <HI>guilty</HI> of all; I proceed now to give a more particular de&s;cription of this obedience, as it is found in <HI>the heirs of &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>IT appears from what has been &s;aid a|bove, that chri&s;tian obedience is partly internal, partly external. It begins in the <HI>heart,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, or a principle of real piety and virtue &s;eated <HI>there.</HI> Thence it diffu&s;es it&s;elf into the actions and lives of men, regulating and animating all their outward deportment. Tho&s;e who are really the &s;ubjects of chri&s;tian piety, or evangelical holine&s;s, are the &s;ame men <HI>within,</HI> that they are <HI>without,</HI> or in appearance. If you could look into the brea&s;t of a good man you would there &s;ee that, which cor|re&s;ponds
<PB N="337" REF="007488_0342_102B92035641E428">
and an&s;wers to his outward be|haviour; the latter being only a re&s;em|blance and copy of the former; tho' one attends the other as certainly and invari|ably as the &s;hadow does the &s;ub&s;tance, there being an in&s;eparable connexion be|twixt them. So that, on one hand, He is certainly no chri&s;tian, all who&s;e religion is within, not exerting it&s;elf in a good exter|nal behaviour: And, on the other hand, He is no chri&s;tian, all who&s;e religion is ex|ternal, having nothing which corre&s;ponds thereto in his own heart and brea&s;t. The one has neither the <HI>power</HI> nor the <HI>form</HI> of godline&s;s: The other, tho' he has the form, yet he denies the power thereof; being like tho&s;e, whom our Saviour com|pares to "<HI>whited &s;epulchres,</HI> which indeed appear beautiful <HI>outwards,</HI> but are <HI>within</HI> full of dead men's bones, and of all un|cleanne&s;s."</P>
<P>AGAIN: As the precepts of the go&s;pel may be di&s;tributed under the two heads of <HI>negative</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive; i. e.</HI> commands prohibiting the doing of &s;ome things, and injoining the doing of others; chri&s;tian obedience may be di&s;tributed into <HI>negative</HI> and <HI>po&s;itive,</HI> likewi&s;e; &s;o as to corre&s;pond to the&s;e different kinds of precepts. The true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t accounts him&s;elf o|bliged, not only to ab&s;tain from what his
<PB N="338" REF="007488_0343_102B9204E1F392F8">
Lord has forbidden, but to do tho&s;e things which he has required. Accordingly he avoids with care, all tho&s;e paths which he is admoni&s;hed not to walk in; and con|&s;cientiou&s;ly performs the duties which are injoined upon him. He knows that in the judgment of the great day, according to our Saviour's own repre&s;entation of it, men will be condemned, not only for committing tho&s;e crimes which the go&s;pel has forbidden, but al&s;o for omitting tho&s;e duties which it has required us to practice. He is therefore cautious, on one hand, le&s;t he &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t any of the negative commandments; and careful on the other, to fulfill all the duties and obli|gations lying upon him.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to ob&s;erve, that chri&s;tian obedience re&s;pects both the <HI>morals</HI> of the go&s;pel, and the <HI>po&s;itive in&s;titutions</HI> of it. A true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t e&s;teems him&s;elf bound to conform to the <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> wor&s;hip, and the <HI>ritual</HI> or <HI>ceremonial</HI> part of Chri&s;t's religion, as well as to that part of it which we di&s;tingui&s;h therefrom, by the name of <HI>moral.</HI> With him, every thing is an e&s;&s;en|tial branch of duty and obedience, which Chri&s;t's laws have actually and plainly in|joined, by whatever name it is called, whether morality, or po&s;itive in&s;titution. Indeed the <HI>obligation</HI> is, in a &s;en&s;e moral,
<PB N="339" REF="007488_0344_102B9206C7898CD8">
altho' the duty, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, may not be &s;o. For certainly we are under a mo|ral obligation to comply with the <HI>whole</HI> will of God and our Redeemer, in what way &s;oever it is made known to us; whe|ther by the light of nature, or by revela|tion and po&s;itive command. I do not, in|deed, a&s;&s;ert that a chri&s;tian lays an <HI>equal</HI> &s;tre&s;s upon every thing which Chri&s;t has commanded. There were &s;ome <HI>weightier matters</HI> of the law, of old: There are al|&s;o &s;ome <HI>weightier matters</HI> of the go&s;pel now: And our Saviour and his apo&s;tles, have evidently made this di&s;tinction. However, a &s;incere chri&s;tian does not think any of his Lord's commandments of &s;o little importance, that they need not be obeyed. There is, in &s;hort, no <HI>trifle</HI> in our religion, unle&s;s you will &s;ay, that the Author of it was a <HI>Trifler!</HI>&mdash;All the real duties of it are &s;olemn, weighty and important, in their re&s;pective places; and all &s;tamped with a divine authority. The whole &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tian duties, or of chri&s;tianity reduced to life and practice, is like a goodly <HI>fabrick,</HI> ari&s;ing into uni|formity, proportion and beauty, by a corre&s;pondence and due adju&s;tment of the various parts. A &s;kilful <HI>Architect</HI> will o|mit nothing which might contribute to the regularity, the &s;trength and beauty of
<PB N="340" REF="007488_0345_102B920959259388">
the whole <HI>pile,</HI> merely becau&s;e it is not a main <HI>pillar</HI> in the building, nor a part of the <HI>foundation.</HI> Neither will a wi&s;e and good man neglect any one duty, under the vain pretence, that it is not a <HI>fundamen|tal</HI> one; or that his &s;piritual <HI>edifice</HI> will &s;tand &s;trong enough without it. And tho&s;e who excu&s;e them&s;elves from known, plain duties, under this hypocritical pretext, will find that they have not <HI>built their hou&s;e up|on a rock,</HI> but only upon the <HI>&s;and;</HI> and <HI>great</HI> will be the <HI>fall thereof.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t be a little more particular &s;till, in this account of the chri&s;tian temper and character, as it re&s;pects God, our Sa|viour, our neighbour, our &s;elves.</P>
<P>THE &s;incere Chri&s;tian has an undi&s;|&s;embled love and veneration for God, as the be&s;t and greate&s;t, and mo&s;t glorious of Beings. He heartily re&s;pects and ho|nors Him; is thankful for His mercies; tru&s;ts and hopes in Him; and prizes His favour above all things. Hence it is to him as his meat and his drink to do the will of his Father, who is in heaven. He is patient under adver&s;ity, as being &s;ent or permitted by Him for wi&s;e and good ends. In pro&s;perity, he confides not in the uncertain things of this world; <HI>but in the living God, who giveth him all things richly to enjoy.</HI> He is truly grateful to
<PB N="341" REF="007488_0346_102B920AE05C2A18">
Him, as the original author and be&s;tow|er of every thing good and de&s;ireable, whether pertaining to life or godline&s;s. He is heartily &s;orry and penitent for his &s;ins; confe&s;&s;ing them, from time to time, with humility and a contrite heart; pray|ing for the forgivene&s;s of them, in the &s;pirit of the <HI>Publican;</HI> and imploring the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he may walk more as becomes a child of God for the future, and be <HI>kept by his power thro' faith unto &s;al|vation.</HI> To which end, he does not only <HI>pray,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>watch;</HI> and is diligent in the improvement of all the means which God has appointed, in order thereto; thinking it great pre&s;umption and impiety to tru&s;t in God for &s;alvation, in any other way than that which He has ordained.</P>
<P>THE true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, loves <HI>Him</HI> al&s;o in &s;incerity; and heartily e&s;teems and honors him, as being the <HI>image of the in|vi&s;ible God,</HI> the <HI>brightne&s;s of his glory,</HI> the <HI>expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</HI> He con&s;iders him as the great Amba&s;&s;ador and Prince of peace, whom God &s;ent into this apo&s;|tate, guilty world, to &s;ave &s;inners; to &s;ave that which was <HI>lo&s;t.</HI> This he accounts <HI>a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation;</HI> as <HI>good tidings of great joy to all people.</HI> He loves and honors this great Mini&s;ter of heaven, as One who has &s;hown the mo&s;t
<PB N="342" REF="007488_0347_102B920CC3EFEF40">
amazing kindne&s;s and conde&s;cention to guilty men, in becoming incarnate; in undergoing poverty and reproach, and <HI>enduring the contradiction of &s;inners again&s;t him&s;elf;</HI> in pouring out his &s;oul unto death, and <HI>bearing our &s;ins in his own body on the tree.</HI> The true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t cannot think of the&s;e things, without being filled with plea&s;ing admiration, with holy gra|titude, love and joy. And having a fixed belief of their truth, and a thorough &s;en&s;e of them upon his heart, he accordingly repo&s;es his tru&s;t in Chri&s;t for &s;alvation, in &s;ubordination to the Father, who &s;ent him on this gracious errand. He willingly re|&s;igns him&s;elf into the hands of his great Redeemer, in full confidence that he is <HI>able to &s;ave them unto the uttermo&s;t, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unto God by him;</HI> and that he is faithful to <HI>keep that which is committed to him.</HI> And knowing that God has exalted him, that he might be a <HI>Prince,</HI> as well as a <HI>Saviour,</HI> he con&s;iders him as his Lord and Sove|reign, whom he is bound to obey; and accordingly &s;ubmits to be governed by his laws. Without this he knows that Chri&s;t can profit him nothing. However this is not the only motive of his obedience; Love and gratitude to One, who has laid him under &s;uch mighty obligations, are a &s;trong incentive thereto; and he is &s;en&s;i|ble
<PB N="343" REF="007488_0348_102B920E4D868258">
he can never <HI>live</HI> enough to <HI>Him,</HI> who has <HI>died</HI> for him. From the&s;e and &s;uch|like con&s;iderations, the &s;incere Chri&s;tian chearfully conforms him&s;elf to the com|mandments of his Redeemer; often cal|ling to mind the time when the heavens which have received him, &s;hall again re|veal him with his mighty angels, in the glory of the Father; to be <HI>admired in all them that believe;</HI> and to render to the ir|reclaimable workers of iniquity, accord|ing to their doings: The contemplation of which final &s;cene, and great deci&s;ive day, when the <HI>my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini|&s;hed,</HI> fills him with &s;acred awe, mixed with holy hope and joy; all con&s;piring to make him diligent that he may be found of his Judge in peace, <HI>without &s;pot and blamele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>CHRISTIAN obedience may al&s;o be con&s;idered with particular reference to our fellow-men. A chri&s;tian looks upon all men as his <HI>brethren</HI> by nature; as the offspring of the &s;ame God, the common Father of all. He accordingly bears a hearty good will and benevolence to all; e&s;pecially when he reflects, that Chri&s;t &s;o loved them, as to <HI>give his life a ran&s;om for all.</HI> This exten&s;ive charity makes him bear a part both in the joys and &s;orrows of others: He is not an indifferent, uncon|cerned

&s;pectator of the woes and calami|ties that befall his fellow-mortals; or like the rock on the &s;ea-&s;hore, which proudly looks down on the &s;hipwreck at its foot, without a groan, or &s;ympathizing tear. No! He feels for all; <HI>weeping with them that weep,</HI> and <HI>rejoicing with them that do rejoice.</HI> As he has opportunity, he <HI>does good to all men;</HI> but <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> to them that are of the <HI>hou&s;hold of faith.</HI> He is &s;incerely de&s;irous of acting &s;uch a part upon the &s;tage of life, as may render him &s;ervice|able to the world, whatever &s;tation pro|vidence has a&s;&s;igned him;&mdash;&s;erviceable, more particularly, to tho&s;e, with whom he has any &s;pecial connexion or inter|cour&s;e. He therefore proceeds, accord|ing to his capacity, in all the tran&s;actions of civil and &s;ocial life, by the rules of ju&s;|tice, charity and prudence. Is he a civil ruler? The apo&s;tle's de&s;cription is exem|plified in him;&mdash;<HI>He is the mini&s;ter of God for good; a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI> Is he a private &s;ub|ject?

He does not judge, and condemn, and &s;et at naught his brother, merely be|cau&s;e he is of a different per&s;wa&s;ion in re|ligious matters; this common practice be|ing as contrary to the &s;pirit and genius, and to the expre&s;s precepts of the go&s;pel, as either <HI>drunkenne&s;s</HI> or <HI>&s;tealing, adultery</HI> or <HI>profane &s;wearing.</HI> In fine here; the real Chri&s;tian loves his neighbour as him&s;elf; and from this principle, does unto all men <HI>what&s;oever he would that they &s;hould do unto him.</HI> By this grand, comprehen&s;ive max|im, he regulates all his &s;ocial behaviour; even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where expre&s;s, po&s;itive

<P>LASTLY: Chri&s;tian obedience may be con&s;idered with relation to a man's &s;elf. And if we con&s;ider it in this light, the true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t keeps under his bo|dy, and brings it into &s;ubjection: Or in the language of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in another place, He, <HI>thro' the &s;pirit, mortifies the deeds of the body.</HI> The rational and &s;piritual part in him (which is <HI>king by divine right,</HI> in the oeconomy and con&s;titution of man) bears &s;way over animal nature, re&s;training the &s;ubject-pa&s;&s;ions, and giving law to them. No &s;in <HI>reigns</HI> in his mortal body, &s;o that he <HI>obeys</HI> it in the lu&s;ts thereof. He is nei|ther a gluttonous man, nor a wine-bibber, nor an unclean per&s;on; but is &s;ober and temperate in all things, as one that &s;trives for the ma&s;tery.

<P>THUS I have con&s;idered the <HI>extent</HI> of evangelical obedience; and given you a &s;hort de&s;cription of it, as it is found in the hearts and lives of good men. It is, in|deed, only the out-lines, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;trong and di&s;tingui&s;hing features of the <HI>new man,</HI> which I have drawn: There is not time to fill up and fini&s;h the picture.

Some per&s;ons would, probably, have been better plea&s;ed, if I had talked more of high <HI>flights,</HI> and <HI>raptures,</HI> and <HI>exta&s;ies,</HI> and le&s;s about the <HI>morality</HI> of the chri&s;tian cha|racter. But &s;uch things, in this kind of painting, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, appear to me to to be no better than vain <HI>ornaments,</HI> and <HI>flouri&s;hes,</HI> and a gaudy <HI>drapery;</HI> which ra|ther ob&s;cure, than heighten and improve, the beauties of a piece. The chri&s;tian character is &s;o amiable in it&s;elf, without any thing of this &s;ort, that it &s;tands in no need thereof to recommend it to tho&s;e, who have a true and ju&s;t <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> It is not every chri&s;tian that is caught up with Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> into the <HI>third heaven,</HI> and hears <HI>un|&s;peakable words,</HI> and has a <HI>multitude of re|velations</HI> given to him: And many that only <HI>fancy</HI> this is the ca&s;e with them, are <HI>lifted up above mea&s;ure;</HI> thinking them|&s;elves &s;o <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> that they have no need to be <HI>moral.</HI> In &s;hort, to &s;peak of things of this nature, I mean of the&s;e flights and raptures, as common to &s;incere chri&s;tians, and the evidences of a good e&s;tate, (as many do) has a direct tendency to mi&s;lead and beguile people; but none at all, to edify them, or make them <HI>wi&s;e to &s;alvation.</HI> For which rea&s;on I have cho&s;en to con|fine my&s;elf within the limits of &s;trict, &s;ober truth, in &s;peaking upon this important

point. Nor can I think that any man has a right, according to the doctrine of the go&s;pel, to look upon him&s;elf as a favourite of heaven, and an heir of the promi&s;es, the temper of who&s;e mind, and who&s;e out|ward behaviour, does not in general cor|re&s;pond to the account given above. In|deed that kingdom of God which is <HI>with|in</HI> us, con&s;i&s;ting in righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, is, in &s;ome re|&s;pects, like His external and vi&s;ible king|dom: It is, as a <HI>grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed,</HI> (which is the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of all) when it fir&s;t takes root in the heart: but it afterwards becometh a <HI>tree,</HI> &s;hooting its branches to heaven; and, being watered with the dew thereof, and warmed by the influences of Him, who is a <HI>Sun</HI> as well as <HI>Shield,</HI> it beareth more than <HI>twelve manner of fruit,</HI> grateful to God and man. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that all truly good men may not be able to &s;ee, with equal clearne&s;s, the evidence of their being &s;uch; becau&s;e this mu&s;t depend, in a great mea&s;ure, up|on the progre&s;s they have made in good|ne&s;s and holine&s;s.

<P><PB N="361" REF="007488_0366_102B92326513AF18">
THIRDLY, The end hereof, <HI>namely,</HI> That He may give <HI>every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things comprehend the whole &s;ubject, which is to employ our thoughts at this time: And, being con&s;idered, they will lead us to &s;ome practical reflections of the mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting na|ture.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider, what is im|plied in this a&s;&s;ertion, That <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked;</HI> &s;o that it is extremely difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, exactly to <HI>know it.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>heart</HI> of man, in the moral, &s;crip|tural and theological &s;en&s;e, intends the mind, or &s;oul; that living, active prin|ciple within us, which thinks, choo&s;es, determines; and which is, properly &s;peak|ing, the agent in all we do whether good or bad, the body being only its in&s;tru|ment; intirely pa&s;&s;ive, and therefore not, in &s;trict propriety, the &s;ubject of any moral or religious qualities whatever. So that to &s;ay the hearts of men are de|ceitful and wicked, and to &s;ay that <HI>men</HI> are &s;o them&s;elves, amounts to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t. And accordingly, in com|mon di&s;cour&s;e, when we &s;peak of a wick|ed and good, a deceitful and hone&s;t heart,
<PB N="362" REF="007488_0367_102B9233EFE8BD70">
a&s;cribing one to one man, and the other to another; we intend hereby to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the real characters of men, con&s;i|dered in a religious or moral view; and to give to them re&s;pectively, that which belongs to them: This is what we de&s;ign, in this manner of &s;peaking, however un|ju&s;tifiable it may be, to make &s;o free with our neighbours characters, as we often do.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervation, it is evident that when it is &s;aid, that <HI>the heart is deceitful, &amp;c.</HI> it cannot be intended, that the hearts of all men are &s;o: For this would be, in effect, to &s;ay that all men are <HI>deceitful</HI> above all things, and <HI>de&s;pe|rately wicked.</HI> To &s;ay which, in ab&s;olute terms, and without limitation, would in fact be, to take away that di&s;tinction which we always make betwixt the cha|racters of men, &s;aying that the&s;e are up|right and good but tho&s;e fal&s;e and wick|ed: Which di&s;tinction betwixt men, is al&s;o con&s;tantly &s;uppo&s;ed, taken for grant|ed, and a&s;&s;erted, in the holy &s;criptures.

<PB N="363" REF="007488_0368_102B84AD38EC7AB0">
that a per&s;on's heart, is thus <HI>deceitful,</HI> thus <HI>de&s;perately</HI> wicked, is to characterize him as a bad man, directly the rever&s;e of him, whom the &s;cripture &s;tyles good and up|right. We mu&s;t therefore, either totally confound all characters, a&s;&s;erting that there are no &s;incere good man, or el&s;e we mu&s;t acknowledge that the&s;e words in the prophet, are &s;poken of the hearts of the wicked, exclu&s;ively of others. For it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to &s;how, who is the good man in di&s;tinction from the wicked, or who the wicked man, in di&s;tinction from the good, if it is common to all men to have hearts that are &s;o <HI>deceitful</HI> and <HI>wicked.</HI> You can &s;ay nothing wor&s;e of the wor&s;t men, than you actually &s;ay of the be&s;t, if you apply this to all men in general: So that either your di&s;tinction betwixt good men and bad, mu&s;t be vain and groundle&s;s; or el&s;e you wre&s;t and pervert the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, when you apply this wor&s;t of characters to all men without exception. However, it is not de&s;igned in what is here &s;aid, to intimate that the hearts of any men are perfectly upright and good. There is doubtle&s;s a degree of deceitfulne&s;s and wickedne&s;s in the hearts of the be&s;t.

<P>WHEN it is &s;aid in the text, that the heart is deceitful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is evident that the prophet had the <HI>Jews</HI> more e&s;pecially in his eye, who&s;e general, national character at this time, was that of a profligate, abando|ned people, in the common gro&s;s &s;en&s;e; in contradi&s;tinction from a pious and vir|tuous people: Such they are repre&s;ented to be, in this very chapter; and particu|larly

The heart plays &s;uch jugg|ling, legerdemain tricks with it&s;elf! Men that are void of fairne&s;s and probity of mind, evidently put deceptions upon them&s;elves, in various ways; in&s;en&s;ibly flattering them&s;elves, that they are certain|ly and truly good, and upright, while they certainly are not; but live in the prac|tice of flagrant immoralities, which every one almo&s;t, except them&s;elves, &s;ees plainly enough. So deceitful are men, even with regard to them&s;elves! And the clue mentioned, if pur&s;ued, would lead us thro' all the doublings, and labyrinths of a di&s;hone&s;t heart; that <HI>den</HI> of brutal lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions; that <HI>cage of unclean birds;</HI> that <HI>dark vault,</HI> which is <HI>full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanne&s;s,</HI> tho' the <HI>monument</HI> over it may appear white and beautiful.</P>

GOD judges of men's characters, not by outward appearances, but by their hearts: His eye penetrates into the mo&s;t &s;ecret re|ce&s;&s;es of our &s;ouls; and therefore His "judgment is according to truth." He takes cognizance of our hearts in all we do. When we come before him to &s;erve him, and "&s;it before him as his people &s;it|teth," he ob&s;erves whether we do it in &s;in|cerity and devotion, or whether our hearts are &s;till "far from him." When we pray to, or prai&s;e him, he ob&s;erves whe|ther we wor&s;hip him "in &s;pirit and in truth," or for a <HI>pretence</HI> only; and that we may get leave of our con&s;ciences to in|dulge our lu&s;ts. When we impart of our temporal &s;ub&s;tance to the nece&s;&s;itous, he ob&s;erves whether this is done in chri&s;tian charity, and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, or that we "may be &s;een of men." Whatever good things we do, and whatever &s;ins we ab&s;tain from, he ob&s;erves whether we do thus from a &s;en&s;e of duty, and a regard to his authority, or merely from &s;ome prudential and worldly con&s;iderations. He di&s;criminates exactly betwixt the in|ward characters of all men; knowing who are truly good and upright, notwith|&s;tanding their numerous imperfections and failings; and who are at the bottom &s;till vicious, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome things

<P>NOR does &s;uch a perfect knowledge of our hearts, as is here intended, only im|ply in general, that God di&s;tingui&s;hes be|tween good men and bad; but al&s;o that he ob&s;erves in what degree either of the&s;e characters belongs to us; what enhances the guilt of &s;ome; what le&s;&s;ens that of others; what exalts and en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bles our vir|tues; what tarni&s;hes and &s;ullies them.

On the other hand, he &s;ees our evil devices, purpo&s;es and inclinations, altho' they never become effect. In fine here, when God is &s;aid to &s;earch our hearts, and try our reins, the meaning is, that none of tho&s;e artifices and di&s;gui&s;es which men u&s;e, in order to impo&s;e upon one another; nor any of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e deceits and delu&s;ions, which they &s;ometimes put e|ven upon them&s;elves, can in the lea&s;t degree conceal their true character from almighty God.

tho' briefly, con&s;idered, the &s;ub|ject will be clo&s;ed with &s;ome practical inferences and reflections.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider the brevity of life.

<P>BUT the duration of this our mortal life is as nothing, even with relation to &s;ome finite Beings: I mean tho&s;e which were pre&s;ent, and mini&s;tring &s;pirits to God, when the foundations of the earth were laid; and when it was &s;aid, <Q>Let US make man. The <HI>Angels,</HI> tho&s;e

that will never end. Let us, therefore, now draw &s;ome practical inferences and reflections from this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>AND here, in the fir&s;t place: Altho' it may be natural for us to lament our mor|tal and &s;orrowful condition in this world; yet &s;ince this is by the appointment of God, we ought humbly to acquie&s;ce in it, without murmuring. Our duty is &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, not complaining or finding fault. God had an indi&s;putable right either to give us life and being, or not; to give it to us either for a longer or &s;horter time; and to make our condition either more or le&s;s happy, as &s;eemed proper to his un|erring wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. We have no demand upon his ju&s;tice for a longer or happier life, than that which he be|&s;tows upon us in this world, &s;hort and unhappy as it is. Nor &s;hould it be ever for|gotten, that perfect wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s, are the rule of his di&s;pen|&s;ations towards his creatures. The State we are now in, is &s;uch a one as God judged proper to place us in, in order to manife&s;t to Us, if not to other beings in other worlds, his holine&s;s and righteous &s;everity; his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the workers of iniquity. It is a &s;ignal mani|fe&s;tation of his anger again&s;t the fir&s;t tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors of his law in this world; and a

perpetual <HI>memento</HI> to Us, their po&s;terity.

really no &s;uch thing as long life in this world. There are but few men, if any, who would be willing that the gla&s;s of life, which is turned up at their birth, and then begins to run, &s;hould be choaked and &s;topped before it is run quite out: We choo&s;e to &s;ee the la&s;t &s;and fall, and to at|tain to the full mea&s;ure of man's days on earth. Nor does this &s;atisfy all: Even three&s;core and ten, or four&s;core years, when, by rea&s;on of unu&s;ual &s;trength, they are attained to, &s;eem but a &s;hort life to tho&s;e few who arrive at them, being &s;pent as a "tale that is told."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90, 9.</NOTE> The P&s;almi&s;t's que&s;tion in the beginning of the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now read, [<Q>What man is he that de&s;ireth life, and loveth many days?</Q>] does not, therefore, imply, that there are few, or none, who thus de&s;ire to live long. Tho' interrogations often carry in them a negation; their &s;en&s;e is always to be determined by circum&s;tances, and the &s;ubject &s;poken of. Accordingly the true import of this que&s;tion, mu&s;t here be, That mankind in general breath this wi&s;h, de&s;iring to &s;ee many days: which is a truth, evident from our daily ob&s;ervation and experience.</P>
<P>THAT they may live long, is plainly the wi&s;h of people in gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ral; &s;o that this may be called their <HI>Common Prayer,</HI> whe|ther

made with, or without Book and Form: All in a manner conform to it, without any &s;cruples of con&s;cience: You will &s;carce find a &s;ingle Di&s;&s;enter. It is the wi&s;h and prayer, which is common to all nations, to all &s;ects and parties, to people of all religions; and even to tho&s;e who have no religion at all. Here Pro|te&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, Jews and Mahome|tans, and pagan Idolaters, are agreed; all joining unanimou&s;ly in the &s;ame petition. In this point, the high and low, the rich and poor, bond and free; in this the young and the old, male and female, people of all conditions, occupations and characters, are well united. Good men and bad, are not at variance here; both generally con&s;enting in the &s;ame wi&s;h and conclu&s;i|on, tho', perhaps, induced thereto by dif|ferent, or even contrary, principles. They who de&s;pi&s;e this world, and they who court and adore it; Saints and Sinners, here &s;hake hands; and even the Athei&s;t is not &s;ingular: For he will pray to <HI>Nature,</HI> and his <HI>Stars,</HI> tho' not to GOD, to grant him many days on earth. That life is a de&s;ireable good, might, then, be an article in every per&s;on's creed; and indeed, the le&s;s people believe of <HI>other things,</HI> the more firmly do they generally believe <HI>this;</HI> &s;o that the greate&s;t <HI>Sceptics</HI> are, here, the
<PB N="457" REF="007488_0462_102B92E133AB5350">
greate&s;t <HI>bigots;</HI> being attached to this life and world, in the &s;ame proportion that they doubt of another. We might there|fore change and invert the P&s;almi&s;t's que&s;|tion, and a&s;k&mdash;<Q>What man is he that de&s;ireth <HI>not</HI> life, and loveth <HI>not</HI> many days?</Q> And, indeed, the que&s;tion thus put, does, I &s;uppo&s;e, as fully and exactly expre&s;s his meaning, as it does in the other way; the negative par|ticle making no real alteration in the &s;en&s;e of &s;uch interrogatories; the true intent of which, can be determined only by the nature of the &s;ubject, to which they relate.</P>
<P>IT is farther to be ob&s;erved, that the royal P&s;almi&s;t does not here &s;peak with &s;uch an air, as would lead one to &s;u&s;pect, that he di&s;approved or condemned this common de&s;ire of living to old age. He &s;peaks of it, not as being in it&s;elf criminal; but as what was natural to man, and therefore innocent; at lea&s;t under certain re&s;trictions and limitations. Mortality and death, are unnatural; as unnatural as di&s;obedience to God, which was the original cau&s;e thereof. And mere nature cannot but be fond of life, and de&s;irous of removing death to as great a di&s;tance as po&s;&s;ible. When I &s;ay, that mere <HI>nature</HI> cannot but do &s;o, I mean that a man can|not, unle&s;s he is influenced by &s;ome high|er
<PB N="458" REF="007488_0463_102B92E555F798A0">
principle than that of natural rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e; or el&s;e lies under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ome heavy calamity, which makes life a burden to him. The former is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e good men, who&s;e trea|&s;ure and heart and hope are in heaven, <Q>whither the Fore-Runner is for them entered, even Je&s;us:</Q> The latter is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e wretched, tho&s;e de&s;perate men, who &s;eek an a&s;&s;ylum from pain and &s;orrow here, in a tragical, voluntary death. Had the de&s;ire of long life been in it&s;elf criminal, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that the P&s;almi&s;t would have encou|raged this de&s;ire in us, by telling us, in the next words, what is the mo&s;t likely way to prolong it, and render it happy&mdash;<Q>Keep thy tongue from evil; and thy lips from &s;peaking guile: depart from evil, and do good, &amp;c.</Q> That is, Let him that loveth many days, that he may &s;ee good, keep his tongue, &amp;c. This is the coherence and natural connexion of the P&s;almi&s;t's words.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, That long life is often &s;poken of in &s;cripture, as a good, a real ble&s;&s;ing, the reward of piety. You know the &s;tory of good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> when he was "&s;ick unto death." And God &s;ometimes encourages the obedience of the young, with the hopes of living long.&mdash;<Q>Honor

thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long</Q>&mdash;Thus al&s;o God &s;ays of the good man, <Q>Becau&s;e he hath &s;et his love upon me, I will deliver him&mdash;with long life will I &s;atisfy him, and &s;hew him my &s;alvation.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> So length of days is &s;aid to be in the right hand of wi&s;dom. And you know, that to die in youth; to be cut off in the mid&s;t of One's days, by a premature death, is u&s;ually con|&s;idered in &s;cripture, under the notion of a real evil: and it is &s;ometimes repre&s;ent|ed as the effect of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. To which purpo&s;e are the following pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;<Q>Bloody and deceitful men &s;hall not live out half their days&mdash;Be not wicked over much; for why &s;hould&s;t thou die before thy time.</Q> Many o|ther pa&s;&s;ages might be added to the&s;e: But it is needle&s;s. As long life is the de|&s;ire of all in general; &s;o the &s;cripture re|pre&s;ents it as being no unrea&s;onable, to be&s;ure no criminal, de&s;ire: It is &s;poken of as the reward of piety; good men are encouraged with the hopes of it. Un|timely, or premature death, on the con|trary, is often con&s;idered as an evil; and threatned as a cur&s;e.</P>
<P>NOW it may be u&s;eful, in farther di&s;|cour&s;ing upon this &s;ubject, to inquire, In what re&s;pects long life is a ble&s;&s;ing? or
<PB N="460" REF="007488_0465_102B92ECD042B070">
why it &s;hould be accounted &s;o? It will then be &s;hown, that the practice of reli|gion tends to prolong the life of man, and to make it happy: So that it is incum|bent upon all, who love many days that they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee good, to depart from evil and do good, to fear God and keep his commandments: For <Q>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his ears are open unto their cry.</Q> The&s;e things being done, the &s;ubject will be clo&s;ed with &s;ome practical reflections, as the time will allow.</P>
<P>SINCE we all naturally de&s;ire to live long, it were to be wi&s;hed, that we de|&s;ired this upon rational motives, and con|&s;iderations which it becomes &s;uch crea|tures as we are, to be influenced by. Let us therefore inquire, as was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P>FIRST, In what re&s;pects long life is de&s;ireable? why it &s;hould be accounted a ble&s;&s;ing? and how far it is really &s;o? In order to our making a proper e&s;timate of life, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we con&s;ider it as it is; that we con&s;ider it with tho&s;e advantages, and tho&s;e equally real di&s;ad|vantages, with which the po&s;terity of <HI>Adam</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s it; that we con&s;ider the re|ference which this life has to another; to the true ends and purpo&s;es of life; and that we con&s;ider what influence our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="461" REF="007488_0466_102B92F07AFA5F98">
behaviour, will have into our future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, according to the principles of religion. Without having all the&s;e things before us, and keeping them con&s;tantly in view, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould judge ju&s;tly upon this &s;ubject: We &s;hall not rea&s;on, but only rave; and bewilder our &s;elves in an endle&s;s maze of uncertainty and error. If the foundation be not properly laid, the &s;uper&s;tructure, however regularly built upon it, will be only as an airy ca&s;tle in the land of Fai|ries. If we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent life, ei|ther as more or le&s;s happy than it really is; or if we detach it from futurity, as having no connexion with another &s;tate; we &s;hall never come to a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion con|cerning the point before us: We &s;hall ne|ver know in what re&s;pects life is a ble&s;|&s;ing; how far it is &s;o; how it is to be conducted in order to make the mo&s;t and be&s;t of it: We &s;hall always either under or over-rate its value; and the re&s;ult of all, will be no better than a dream or reverie; at lea&s;t, it will not be real wi&s;|dom, and &s;alutary truth.</P>
<P>LET me therefore remind you of a few facts, and well-known principles, which are to be taken along with us; and which are &s;o fundamental, that without them we cannot duly e&s;timate the value of life; but
<PB N="462" REF="007488_0467_102B92F2CF5049C0">
mu&s;t needs wander far from the truth.</P>
<P>IT is to be premi&s;ed, then, That the pre&s;ent life is, at be&s;t, a &s;cene of great trouble and di&s;quietude. This world was originally de&s;igned for a place of happi|ne&s;s, by our Creator: But man's apo&s;tacy from God, has changed it, tho' not into an hell, yet into an habitation of much &s;orrow and vexation. For notwith&s;tand-&s;tanding the many delights, (far more, in|deed, than we could claim as our due) which Providence be&s;tows upon us here; yet &s;o numerous, various, and ince&s;&s;ant, are the adver&s;ities to which we are &s;ub|jected, that we cannot but groan under them, as under a load and burden, from which we would gladly be delivered, were it po&s;&s;ible without putting off the&s;e bodies.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, with relation to the plea&s;ures of this life, that they are flattened and dimini&s;hed by old age. Youth is the principal &s;ea&s;on for reli&s;hing and enjoying tho&s;e, which are properly called animal, &s;en&s;itive and worldly plea|&s;ures, as contradi&s;tingui&s;hed from rational, moral, and religious. It is &s;aid with pe|culiar propiety&mdash;<Q>Rejoice, O <HI>young</HI> Man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth:</Q> For after people get pa&s;t the meridian of life,
<PB N="463" REF="007488_0468_102B92F696978608">
the reli&s;h for &s;uch enjoyments gradually fails; much in the &s;ame proportion that animal nature it&s;elf decays. To which it is to be added, that old age is u&s;ually at|tended with many po&s;itive pains peculiar to it&s;elf, youth being a &s;tranger to them, tho' not to all others. And notwith&s;tand|ing &s;ome exceptions, that is doubtle&s;s a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of advanced age in ge|neral, which the P&s;almi&s;t gives: <Q>If, by rea&s;on of &s;trength, they be four&s;core years; yet is their &s;trength labour and &s;orrow.</Q> <HI>Solomon</HI> has dwelt longer up|on this gloomy theme of old age; and painted the &s;cene with deeper &s;hades. The years are then come, when the mo&s;t &s;ay, that they have no plea&s;ure;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Ecle&s;.</HI> 12. 1.&mdash;</NOTE> when the &s;un and the light, the moon and the &s;tars are darkened; when the keepers of the hou&s;e tremble, and the &s;trong men bow them&s;elves; when the grinders cea&s;e becau&s;e they are few, and tho&s;e that look out of the windows are darkned; when they ri&s;e up at the voice of the bird! and all the daughters of mu&s;ic are brought low; when they are afraid of that which is high, and fears are in the way; when the almond-tree flouri&s;heth, and the gra&s;|hopper is a burden; and de&s;ire it&s;elf fail|eth. This is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s de&s;cription of that old age, with its common infirmities and
<PB N="464" REF="007488_0469_102B92FA6A251FA0">
pains, to which we are &s;o de&s;irous of liv|ing. And tho' we &s;hould attain to it; yet it is to be remember'd, that we are not immortal; but mu&s;t unavoidably die at la&s;t, how long &s;oever our lives may be protracted.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t al&s;o remember, that whether we die young or old, we are to live for|ever after this mortal cour&s;e is fini&s;hed; and either be inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy in ano|ther &s;tate, in the favour and loving-kind|ne&s;s of God; or inconceivably wretched, under his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure. This is our time of trial and probation. Tho' we are a &s;inful, apo&s;tate race, yet we are candidates for heaven; &s;o that if we are here reconciled to our Maker, thro' Him that was <HI>made &s;in for us;</HI> and &s;erve God faithfully, we become his children; be|ing <Q>heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t</Q> to an incorruptible inheritance. And the greater degrees of true wi&s;dom, of holine&s;s and virtue, we attain to in this world; by &s;o much the brighter crown of glory, will the righteous Judge of all, give us hereafter. On the other hand, tho&s;e who live and die in their &s;ins, are of cour&s;e and con&s;equence, heirs of the <HI>&s;econd death;</HI> and mu&s;t be mi&s;erable in proportion as they have abu&s;ed the good|ne&s;s, forbearance, and long-&s;uffering of
<PB N="465" REF="007488_0470_102B92FC52CC0AD0">
God; and mi&s;employed the talents com|mitted to their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THE things which have been briefly premi&s;ed, are the common, well-known principles of religion; how little &s;oever they are attended to in a practical &s;en&s;e. And the&s;e principles, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to keep continually in our eye, in order to our forming a proper judgment of hu|man life; in order to our knowing, whe|ther length of days is de&s;irable, or not; and if it is, for what rea&s;ons, and how far it is &s;o.</P>
<P>AND in conformity to the&s;e maxims, it may be laid down for a certain truth, That long life is very little, if at all, to be de&s;ired for its own &s;ake, or upon ac|count of any happine&s;s to be attained here, which is purely of a worldly nature, detached from religion, and the hopes of a better life to come. If this is really an happy &s;tate, upon the whole, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, and without any reference to a|nother; it mu&s;t, indeed, be acknowledged to be a de&s;ireable one in the &s;ame propor|tion; and long life might be wi&s;hed for, were it only in re&s;pect of that felicity which is to be reaped here. I do not ab|&s;olutely deny this to be the ca&s;e: But, alas! when we ballance the account; when we come to weigh the common
<PB N="466" REF="007488_0471_102B9300B01EB1F0">
&s;orrows of life, again&s;t the common joys of it, the &s;cale of happine&s;s will, I believe, very little preponderate, if at all, as to the greater part of mankind. Many of the pains of life are, probably, far more inten&s;e and vivid, than any of its plea&s;ures, and they are, certainly, of much longer duration. People &s;ometimes lie in extreme torture for whole days, weeks, and months, if not years together, with &s;carce any intermi&s;&s;ion: In compari&s;on of which pains, all &s;en&s;ual, and worldly plea&s;ures, are very &s;hort-liv'd; and the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble, probably, the &s;horte&s;t. We never find our&s;elves, nor &s;ee others, for any con&s;iderable time together &s;wallowed up in joy and rapture, as we often &s;ee them &s;wallowed up of &s;orrow and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT leave uncommon, extraordinary examples both of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, out of the que&s;tion for the pre&s;ent; and con&s;ider mankind in general, the main body of the &s;pecies as they ri&s;e. They always have been, now are, and always mu&s;t be, poor and low in the world; ob|liged to toil hard, to ri&s;e early, and &s;et up late, in order to get a livelihood for them&s;elves and families, eating the bread of carefulne&s;s.

"&s;prings eternal in the human brea&s;t," rather than any po&s;itive happine&s;s and enjoyment, which makes people &s;o fond of this life. By this hope we are led on from goal to goal, from one &s;tage of life to another, &s;till expecting to find &s;ome greater good and &s;atisfaction than we have found already; which hope u|&s;ually proves abortive in the end. So that tho&s;e who have lived long, who have had all the means of procuring worldly happine&s;s which any ever had, and gone the round of every &s;en&s;itive en|joyment, have at la&s;t been compelled to own, that all is but <HI>vanity</HI> and <HI>vexation of &s;pirit;</HI> that what the world calls happi|ne&s;s, is &s;carce more than a &s;hadow or a dream: And it is wi&s;e in others to tru&s;t Their experience, le&s;t them&s;elves &s;hould al&s;o be di&s;appointed in the end.</P>
<P>THE re&s;ult of what has been &s;aid, is, That the pre&s;ent life, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, if it may be properly called an happy one upon the whole, is yet &s;o but in a very low degree; and therefore, that long life is but little to be de&s;ired, for the &s;ake of any happine&s;s that can, probably, be attained to here: (Tho' I will not contra|dict the common opinion of the world &s;o much as to &s;ay, that the &s;orrows of life are, generally &s;peaking, more than a bal|lance
<PB N="474" REF="007488_0479_102B931CA1C30160">
to the enjoyments of it, being ab|&s;tracted from hope:) From whence it fol|lows, that life it&s;elf, and length of days up|on earth, are a ble&s;&s;ing, chiefly, con&s;idered with relation to futurity; as this &s;tate is introductory to another, and as long life here gives us greater opportunity and advantage than a &s;hort one, for acquaint|ing our&s;elves with God; for &s;erving Him, and our generation according to his will; for working out our &s;alvation, and &s;ecu|ring to our&s;elves a happy immortality af|ter death. Such a life as the pre&s;ent, however long, unle&s;s con&s;idered in this connexion with futurity, and &s;omewhat that is to &s;ucceed it, would, I think, de|mand no great thanks to the Author of it; it being but an incon&s;iderable good in it&s;elf. But taken with its proper con|nexions and references, it cannot but be looked upon as a great ble&s;&s;ing, which demands our &s;incere prai&s;e and thank&s;giv|ing to the bountiful Donor thereof. It is a price put into our hands to get that true wi&s;dom; to do that good in the world; to gain tho&s;e religious qualities and good habits, which will make us in &s;ome mea&s;ure happy even now, and which will, thro' the goodne&s;s and grace of God, in&s;ure to us, and terminate in, eternal felicity. It is chiefly in the&s;e
<PB N="475" REF="007488_0480_102B9322019B06A8">
re&s;pects, that long life is de&s;ireable. To be candidates for immortal bli&s;s and glo|ry, and put in a way of obtaining them, is certainly a great privilege. And length of days, or a long preparatory, probatio|nary &s;tate, where &s;o much is depending as there is upon the pre&s;ent life, is cer|tainly preferable to a &s;hort one. The more time is allowed us, the more effec|tually we may provide for our future well-being; the more we may acquaint our&s;elves with God and his ways; the greater improvement we may make in piety and virtue. And this will give us greater peace and hope in our latter end; and both qualify us for, and intitle us to, a brighter crown of immortality, than a lower degree of goodne&s;s would have done.</P>
<P>SURELY, when we have &s;o great an intere&s;t at &s;take; when the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls depends upon our becoming truly wi&s;e and good here, it is both natu|ral and rea&s;onable to de&s;ire, that this op|portunity for making provi&s;ion for ano|ther world, for an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is no ground to think, taking the holy &s;criptures for our guide, that tho&s;e who live and die in their &s;ins, &s;hall ever have a future opportunity to redeem their pre&s;ent mi&s;car|riages; or any other time of trial, after this life is terminated. So far as I am able to &s;ee, the utmo&s;t which the&s;e fooli&s;h, mi&s;erable men can hope for, is to be <HI>annihilated</HI> after &s;uffer|ing unutterable torments: Tho' I do not a&s;&s;ert, that they can, according to the &s;cripture account, hope for &s;o great a favour as even this would be, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to be <HI>utterly blotted out of being!</HI> However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture &s;eem, at fir&s;t view, to countenance this &s;uppo&s;ition.</NOTE> <HI>eternal</HI> &s;tate, &s;hould

be protracted as long as may be; as long as is con&s;i&s;tent with the good plea&s;ure of God, and this our mortal condition. The making due preparation for another world, however practicable it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a &s;hort time, is yet a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great importance, as no con&s;iderate man would choo&s;e to have hurried over, or crowded into a little narrow &s;pace, if it could be avoided. Po&s;&s;ibly a per&s;on may be &s;o fooli&s;h and improvident, as to neglect in childhood and youth, which are vanity, this mo&s;t important of all con|cernments: And when this is the ca&s;e, as God knows it too often is, is it not a great favour to have a farther time allow|ed for this purpo&s;e; that &s;o we may re|deem in maturer life, or in old age, the follies and mi&s;conduct of our youth; and may do that work at la&s;t, which ought to have been done at fir&s;t? A&s;k a man who apprehends he is ju&s;t going out of the world, and is con&s;cious that he has hi|therto lived a wicked, profligate life, what he would give for two or three years more, in which to make his peace with God?

And even good men, when they have the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution, unle&s;s they have already attained to a full a&s;&s;u|rance of faith and hope, cannot well help making the prayer which the P&s;almi&s;t did in his &s;ickne&s;s, <Q>O! &s;pare me, that I may recover &s;trength before I go hence, and be no more.</Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;alm</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 13.</NOTE> From the&s;e things we learn the true worth of time, the u&s;e and end of life, the improvement which we ought to make of it; how de&s;ireable long life is, and for what rea&s;ons.

<P>PEOPLE are &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;irous of living long in this world; and pro|mi&s;e them&s;elves &s;o much happine&s;s from it, that it will, doubtle&s;s, appear fanciful and romantic to many, to &s;ay there is &s;carce any thing to be enjoyed here, for which it is worth while to live. But &s;till
<PB N="481" REF="007488_0486_102B9338004F3558">
this is the truth of the ca&s;e: This world is a &s;cene of folly and confu&s;ion, of di&s;ap|pointment and &s;orrow. It's plea&s;ures are precarious, &s;uperficial and tran&s;ient; its troubles are certain, &s;ub&s;tantial, and almo&s;t uninterrupted. So that, were there to be an end of us at death, few or no con|&s;iderate men, could ever expect to enjoy much good; or, con&s;equently, much de|&s;ire to live long here. Such is this life, when con&s;idered in it&s;elf: But the pro&s;|pect clears up, when we con&s;ider the refe|rence which the pre&s;ent &s;tate has to, and its connexion with, another after death. Life is valuable, and length of days to be wi&s;hed for, as it gives us an opportunity to acquaint our&s;elves with God, and to &s;ecure eternal felicity to our&s;elves, when our days here &s;hall be numbered and fi|ni&s;hed. In any other re&s;pect, whether we live long, or die &s;oon; yea, whether we live at all or not, &s;eems to be no ve|ry intere&s;ting point. But this matter was &s;poken of in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e. It was propo&s;ed to &s;how, in the</P>
<P>SECOND Place, That if we are de&s;irous of living long, and of making the be&s;t of life while it la&s;ts, it becomes us to con|duct our&s;elves by the maxims of religion: Or, in the language of the P&s;almi&s;t, to <Q>keep our tongues from evil, and our

lips from &s;peaking guile; to depart from evil, and do good; to &s;eek peace and pur&s;ue it.</Q> The practice of pure, undefiled religion, has a natural tendency to prolong human life, and to render it, in &s;ome degree, happy. For the righ|teous are not only intitled to the favour of almighty God hereafter, but to his peculiar care and guardian&s;hip in this world. Even here, <Q>the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous; and his ears are open unto their cry.</Q> Godline&s;s hath promi&s;e both of <HI>the life that now is,</HI> and al&s;o of that which is <HI>to come;</HI> &s;o that it is <HI>profitable unto all things:</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> And all kinds of arguments are u&s;ed in the holy &s;crip|tures, to induce us thereto. The prin|cipal of them, are tho&s;e which are drawn from a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments: But tho&s;e that may be drawn from pre&s;ent convenience and inconvenience, tho' of far le&s;s weight and force with a wi&s;e man, are not wholly pa&s;&s;ed over in the &s;acred oracles: And, indeed, the latter may po&s;&s;ibly have a greater influence up|on &s;ome minds, than the former.</P>
<P>THE P&s;almi&s;t takes it for granted, that the rea&s;on why men generally de&s;ire life, and love many days, is, that they may <HI>&s;ee good:</HI> They do not de&s;ire life, merely for the &s;ake of living; but in hopes of li|ving
<PB N="483" REF="007488_0488_102B933E520A2A00">
happily. And he a&s;&s;ures us, that the mo&s;t likely means, both of prolonging our lives, and of making them quiet and happy, is to pur&s;ue the paths of piety and virtue. This being the manife&s;t &s;cope and drift of the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;idera|tion, this &s;econd head of di&s;cour&s;e, I think, naturally re&s;olves it&s;elf into two propo&s;i|tions; <ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>THAT the practice of religion is the mo&s;t probable means of <HI>lengthening</HI> out our lives: And</P>
<P>THAT it is al&s;o the mo&s;t likely way for us to <HI>&s;ee good,</HI> or to live happily. God has connected the duty and intere&s;t of men together, not only &s;o that they &s;hall, in the re&s;ult of things, find them&s;elves gain|ers by &s;erving Him; but &s;o that religion is advantageous to them in the <HI>Interim,</HI> e|ven in this world; only the ca&s;e of <HI>per|&s;ecution for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake,</HI> is to be ex|cepted.</P>
<P>1^&s;^t. THE practice of religion is the mo&s;t likely means of <HI>prolonging</HI> human life. It has a direct natural tendency to lengthen out a man's days; while irreligion and vice have plainly a contrary one.

<P>ALL irregular affections, and inordi|nate pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as anger, malice, pride and envy, prey al&s;o upon the &s;pirits and life; tho' not &s;o apparently, perhaps, as bodily exce&s;&s;es.

<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved, That in the &s;ame proportion that religion tends to health and length of days, it is al&s;o productive even of temporal happine&s;s. The felici|ty of animal life, &s;uch as it is, has a clo&s;e connexion with health and &s;oundne&s;s of body; and is, indeed, in&s;eparable there|from. The corporeal di&s;ea&s;es which in|temperance and other vices bring upon men, and by which their lives are cur|tailed, al&s;o dimini&s;h their happine&s;s; ren|dering them incapable of reli&s;hing and enjoying even tho&s;e animal plea&s;ures, which are the grand object of their pur&s;uit. Do you imagine that he who, by crimi|nal indulgences and exce&s;&s;es, and a liber|tine cour&s;e of life, has enfeebled his body, and impaired his health, can receive as much happine&s;s from tho&s;e objects which God has accommodated to our nature, con&s;idered as &s;en&s;itive creatures, as One who, by ob&s;erving the rules of &s;obriety and moderation, pre&s;erves him&s;elf in health and vigor? Far from it! Such a man fru&s;trates his own aim: and while he is criminally gra&s;ping at more plea&s;ure than he ought, deprives him&s;elf in a great mea&s;ure, even of that which he might in|nocently enjoy; yea, often brings &s;uch pains and di&s;ea&s;es upon him&s;elf, as make

<P>RELIGION and virtue are al&s;o condu|cive to the felicity of life, as they gene|rally procure the e&s;teem and good will of men; even of tho&s;e, who have little or no religion them&s;elves. They promote that peace and good under&s;tanding betwixt

man and man, in which happine&s;s here very much con&s;i&s;ts. <Q>When a man's ways plea&s;e the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</Q> This is not, indeed, univer&s;ally the ca&s;e. Even our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his apo&s;tles, were as much or more maligned by the world, than any other per&s;ons who were ever in it. Here were &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tan|ces: But in general it is unque&s;tionably true, that a religious and virtuous con|duct attracts the good-will, and procures the good offices of mankind. A good man is far le&s;s likely to get into trouble|&s;ome contentions and broils, and to have enemies, than a proud, ambitious, cove|tous or wrathful one. Daily ob&s;ervation confirms this. And there are &s;ome vir|tues, which have a more immediate and direct tendency to conciliate the friend&s;hip of men; to promote and to e&s;tabli&s;h that good harmony which is &s;o conducive to happine&s;s: I mean tho&s;e virtues, which are more e&s;pecially alluded to in the text&mdash;Let him that would <HI>&s;ee good,</HI> <Q>keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from &s;peak|ing guile let him depart from evil, and do good; &s;eek peace, and pur&s;ue it.</Q></P>
<P>IT is moreover, and indeed very par|ticularly to be ob&s;erved, That inward peace, and tranquility of mind, is not to

And 'till a man has taken a fatal opiate, and laid his con|&s;cience a&s;leep, it will frequently call him to a &s;evere reckoning for his evil deeds.

And how unhappy is that man, who&s;e own heart condemneth him? who, in&s;tead of being able to look up to his Ma|ker with confidence, cannot even look him&s;elf in the face, without blu&s;hing and trembling? This, in general, is the ca&s;e of wicked men; there is no peace to them. Even in their greate&s;t pro&s;perity, they are frequently di&s;quieted by con&s;cious guilt; and in adver&s;ity, that God, who is the <Q>confidence of the ends of the earth,</Q> is a terror to them.

It animates a good man, in every condi|tion; it gives him &s;trength to do, and re|&s;olution to bear all things. It delights at home and abroad; in company and in &s;olitude: It brightens our days, and &s;wee|tens our nightly &s;lumbers. From youth to age, it pre&s;erves the good in perfect peace, their minds being &s;tayed upon God. Thro' this, they are happy even without tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and enjoyments, in which others place all their felicity; &s;o that <Q>having nothing, they po&s;&s;e&s;s all things.</Q> It at once di&s;arms both life and death of their &s;ting and terrors&mdash;O ble&s;&s;ed hope! it is thou which turne&s;t mourning into gladne&s;s of heart, darkne&s;s into light, and death into life: It is thou which turne&s;t the &s;ufferings of time, into the triumphs of immortality; and cau&s;e&s;t us, even in this vale of tears, <Q>to rejoice with joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory!</Q></P>

and that vice and irreligion have the con|trary tendency, to &s;horten, and make them mi&s;erable. But when I &s;peak of religion as having &s;uch a natural tenden|cy, this is not de&s;igned, by any means, to exclude the providence of God, his care and guardian&s;hip of the righteous. Things have no other tendency, than what God him&s;elf has given them: It is He that has e&s;tabli&s;hed all their connexions, and who con&s;tantly maintains them by his power and providence, "working all in all."

And altho' this is not a &s;tate of retribution, but of di&s;cipline; yet God even now knoweth them that are his, and &s;hews them his peculiar favour; while he, in &s;ome degree, cha&s;tizes the impious and vicious, in the cour&s;e of his providence.

If there are any of them, who have not yet num|bered their days aright, nor applied their hearts to wi&s;dom, it behoves them to do it now, and to redeem the time.

<P>THERE is &s;carce a more melancholly &s;ight to a per&s;on of &s;ober reflection, than a man who is ju&s;t dropping into his grave with old age, &s;till tho'tle&s;s of God, and

It is matter of great grief to the wi&s;e and good, to &s;ee the Young thus incon&s;iderate; thus forgetful of the God that made them; thus regardle&s;s of their future intere&s;t: But to &s;ee the Aged &s;o, is much more &s;orrowful. There is con&s;iderable ground to hope, that the Young may live to &s;ee the error of their ways, and become wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. But when life is already, in a manner, run out; when men have, as it were, one foot in the grave; and are &s;till pur&s;uing vani|ty, &s;traws and bubbles, with all the tho't|le&s;s levity and wantonne&s;s of youth; there is, alas! but little ground for hope with re|&s;pect to them. If their ca&s;e is not quite de&s;perate, it is not far from being &s;o. And &s;urely tho&s;e who have &s;pent a long life in &s;in and folly, mu&s;t have a much more aw|ful account to give of them&s;elves at la&s;t, than they who have &s;pent only a &s;hort one in the &s;ame manner.

The Young are generally hard to be per&s;uaded of this truth, however certain, and however im|portant it is to them, both with relation to this world and another, to time and to eternity. They plea&s;e them&s;elves with fal&s;e notions of happine&s;s; of an happine&s;s independent of God, the &s;ource of all be|ing, of all good;&mdash;of happine&s;s in the a|bundance which a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth; of hap|pine&s;s in worldly honors and preferments; of happine&s;s in a &s;en&s;ual cour&s;e of life.
