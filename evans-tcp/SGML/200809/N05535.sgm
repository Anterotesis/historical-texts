<P><HI>Finally,</HI> dear Souls, in the Reach|ings forth of well-wi&s;hing Love, I ear|ne&s;tly intreat you all, that you don't entertain any Hardne&s;s or Re&s;entment again&s;t any Friend, or Friends, &s;urmi&s;|ing, That &s;uch and &s;uch have borne hard upon you in the Admini&s;tration of Church-Di&s;cipline; for, by &s;o doing, you may &s;oon &s;till more hurt your Con|ditions, block up your own Way, and &s;till &s;et your&s;elves at a farther Di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Some who have given ju&s;t Occa&s;ion, by their undue Liberties, for the Cen|&s;ure

of the Church, have neverthele&s;s been &s;o far from that Humility that al|ways attends true Repentance, that their refractory Deportment to their offend|ed Friends hath height'ned their Offence, yea, even &s;hut clo&s;e that Door again&s;t them&s;elves, whereby they might in due Time probably have been re-admitted into Unity with the Society. It will, I a&s;&s;ure you, dear Souls, be much more plea&s;ing, and acceptable to all the true in Heart, to receive you again, in at the Door afore&s;aid, than it was to ex|clude you; for, as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>More is the Joy over one lo&s;t Sheep (over one Sinner that repenteth) than over Ninety and Nine ju&s;t Per&s;ons which need no Repentance,</HI> yea, even <HI>in the Pre&s;ence of the Angels of God,</HI> Luke xv. 7, 10. Let no poor droop|ing Souls therefore de&s;pair, or de&s;pond, for by the Door afore&s;aid all may be reconciled, rein&s;tated, and re-united, though far gone a&s;tray, as to the Ends of the Earth.</P>

<P>It has been, and is ob&s;erved, that &s;ometimes Per&s;ons that have given real Occa&s;ion for the Line of Judgment to be &s;tretched over them, have taken &s;uch a Di&s;gu&s;t at the ju&s;t Cen&s;ure, when pa&s;t upon them, that they have for&s;ak|en religious A&s;&s;emblies; who by &s;o doing do evidently demon&s;trate great Weakne&s;s, and that they give way to the Spirit of the Enemy, who is always &s;eeking Advantage again&s;t us frail Mor|tals, in order to draw us farther and farther from the Truth, and nearer and nearer to his own dark Kingdom; Wherefore, I again mo&s;t earne&s;tly in|treat you, in much Love and Good|will, that ye who have taken Offence of

Plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that neither civil nor religious Society (morally &s;peaking) can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or be pre&s;erved from utterly relap&s;ing and falling away into Confu&s;ion, without proper Rules and Government: And what &s;ignify Rules if not ob&s;erved? And proper Mea&s;ures taken with tho&s;e that knowingly tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;ame?
