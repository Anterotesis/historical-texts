<P>At the performing the la&s;t Motion of the above command, all the <HI>Drummers</HI> are to beat a March, and the <HI>Major</HI> is immediately <HI>to take his Po&s;t on the Right of the Battalion,</HI> and the <HI>Adjutant</HI> on <HI>the Left of the Battalion, dre&s;&s;ing in a Line with the Rank of Officers.</HI> As the <HI>General</HI> pa&s;&s;es along the Front, the <HI>Officers</HI> are <HI>to Salute</HI> Him with their Half Pikes or Parti&s;ans, and to time it in &s;uch a manner, that each may ju&s;t fini&s;h his Salute and pull off his Hat, when the <HI>General</HI> comes oppo&s;ite to him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OFFICERS</HI> Po&s;ts in Exerci&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Ceremony of Viewing the Regiment is over, the General then ac|quaints the Colonel what he would have per|formed. And the General for the mo&s;t part orders the Manual Exerci&s;e to be performed; then to go thro' &s;ome part of the Firings, and la&s;tly to March by Him either in grand divi&s;ion, &s;ub-divi&s;ions or &s;ingle Company's.</P>
<P>In time of Exerci&s;e, all the Commi&s;&s;ion Offi|cers, as al&s;o the Lieutenant Colonel's Po&s;t, is in the Rear of the Battalion, the Officers eight Paces in the Rear of the Serjeants, the Lieu|tenant
<PB N="6" REF="003633_0007_100238854F419FD8">Colonel four paces behind them, the Serjeants on the Flanks are to March in a di|rect Line to the Front, and as &s;oon as the two Serjeants who were placed on the Flanks of the Front Rank have Marched forty paces, they are to &s;tand; on which the other Ser|jeants are to do the &s;ame: the Serjeants mu&s;t take care to divide the Ground on the Flanks equally among&s;t them The <HI>Drummers</HI> are to March and form them&s;elves into a Rank entire behind the Major. The method of per|forming this is, in the following manner, fir&s;t, The Major is to direct the orderly Drummer to beat a Ruff to give the Officers notice, after that a Flam or double Stroak upon which the Lieutenant Colonel, and the re&s;t of the Officers face to the Right about on their left Heels.</P>
<P>At the &s;econd Flam they are to advance their Half Pikes, and the Serjeants their Halberds. At the third Flam, the Officers, Serjeants, &amp; the three Divi&s;ion of Drummers are all to March to their Po&s;ts, beginning with the Left feet. The Officers are to March thro' the Battalions to their Po&s;ts before mentioned and to &s;tand: When the Major finds that all are in their proper Po&s;ts of Exerci&s;e, he is to order to another Flam to be beat, at which the Officers and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their Left Heels.</P>
<P>The Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels. The Serjeants on the Left Flank are to face to the Right on their Right Heels. As &s;oon as they have faced the Officers are to plant their Half Pikes, the En&s;igns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds on their Right, in which Po&s;ition they
<PB N="7" REF="003633_0008_10023888DBD0D1B0">are to remain till they are ordered to their for|mer Po&s;t after the Exerci&s;e is over. The Drum|mers are to have their Drums always braced and &s;lung during the whole time the Battalion is under hands.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Exerci&s;e is over, the Officers, Serjeants and Drummers are to be ordered to their Po&s;ts in the following manner: Fir&s;t a ruff of Drum to warn them, then a Flam at which the Officers advance their Half Pikes, the En&s;igns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds: After which the Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels, and the Serjeants on the Left are to face to the Right on their Left Heels: At the &s;econd Flam they are all to March to their former Po&s;ts, and as &s;oon as they have got there the Major orders a third Flam to be beat, at which the Officers plant Half Pikes, and the En&s;igns their Colours, and the Serjeants and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their right Heels: After which the Serjeants plant their Halberds.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erve,</HI> when the Officers are ordered to take their Po&s;ts of Exerci&s;e which is in the Rear, the Colonel is not to go to the Rear, but to March &s;trait forward and place him&s;elf by the General, with his Half Pike in his Hand during the Exerci&s;e; and as &s;oon as the Officers are ordered to the Front he is to take his Po&s;t. When the Command falls to the Major by the ab&s;ence of the Colonel or Lieut. Colonel, al|tho' he is to take the Colonel's Po&s;t at the Head of the Regiment, and &s;alute with his half Pike, yet when the Regiment is to perform the Ex|erci&s;e he is always to do it on Hor&s;e-back,
<PB N="8" REF="003633_0009_1002388C0120C9B0">even the Command of a Regiment not being &s;ufficient to excu&s;e him from that part of his duty before a General.</P>
<P>In the ab&s;ence of the Field Officers the El|de&s;t Captain takes the Command, and acts in every re&s;pect as the Colonel would have done were he pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OFFICERS</HI> to your Platoons.</HEAD>
<P>IN dividing the Battalion into Platoons, they &s;hould be compo&s;ed of an equal number of Files, or at lea&s;t not above one File &s;tronger than another, and tho&s;e &s;hould be on the Flanks and Colour Platoons. As &s;oon as the Platoons are told off there mu&s;t be an Officer appoint|ed to each to command them, taking an equal proportion of Captains and Lieutenants and En&s;igns if any there be that carry half Pikes, for the purpo&s;e. The Lieut. Colonel with the remaining part of the Officers are to March and Po&s;t them&s;elves in the Rear of the Battalion, in the &s;ame manner as they do at Exerci&s;e; the Captain, Lieutenant &amp; En&s;ign with Half Pikes that have not Platoons drawing up into one Rank in the Rear of the Serjeants, and the Lieut Colonel in the Rear of the Officers, and oppo&s;ite to the Colour Platoon. The Serjeants &s;hould be di|vided to the &s;everal Platoons, and Po&s;ted in the Rear of the &s;ame. The Colonel and the En&s;igns with the Colours remain in their former Po&s;ts at the head of the Battalion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003633_0010_10020208121F1D48">
There are many rea&s;ons for there being &s;ome Officers Po&s;ted in the Rear, I &s;hall mention only two. They are of great Service in leading the Battalion off in order when they are command|ed to retire. Again, &s;hould there be no Officers in the Rear when the Battalion is ordered to the Right about, the Men would be apt to March off too fa&s;t, and by that means break their Ranks, and fall into Confu&s;ion, or not halt in due time; which inconveniencies are prevented by Officers being there.</P>
<P>The Battalion being prepared to Fire by Pla|toons, the Officers that command them are to place them&s;elves to the Right and Left of their Platoons facing towards the Colours thus; the Officers to the Right of the Colours are to place them&s;elves to the Right of their Platoons, and the Officers to the Left on the Left of their Pla|toons, being only advanced a &s;hort pace towards the Front Rank of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Po&s;ting Drummers.</HI> The two Divi&s;ion of Drummers on the Right and Left are to Po&s;t them&s;elves on the Flanks and dre&s;s in a Line with the Front Rank of Men, and the Center Divi&s;ion of Drummers are to be Po&s;ted before the Colour Platoons, which Drummers are to move to the Right and Left when tho&s;e Platoons Fire. After they have Fired and Loaded then they are to return as they were, at the &s;ame time the <HI>Colonel</HI> Colours and Haut boys (if any there be) are to move to the Right and Left, and as &s;oon as the Colour Platoons have Fired, are to return to their former Po&s;ts; but when the Bat|talion Fires together, the Colours mu&s;t then fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of

<P>The la&s;t part of the Ceremony of Reviewing, is, that of Marching by the General, either by Grand divi&s;ion, Sub divi&s;ions, or &s;ingle Com|pany's.</P>
<P>When a Battalion is divided into three equal Parts each Divi&s;ion is then called a Grand divi|&s;ion: Sub-divi&s;ions are &s;ormed by dividing each Grand-divi&s;ion into three, four or five equal parts, according to the number of Files in each Grand divi&s;ion, the Regiment being three deep, the Sub-divi&s;ions then form Platoons.</P>
<P>By Companies, is the Marching each Compa|ny by it &s;elf, with its own Officers, Serjeants and Drummers.</P>
<P>Before the Regiment Marches off, the Files are to be Clo&s;ed either to the Right, Left or Center; after which the Ranks are to the Clo&s;ed to clo&s;e order, and then ordered to Wheel by Grand or Sub divi&s;ion. Upon the Ranks being Clo&s;ed, the Officers are to fall back on the heads of their &s;everal Divi&s;ions.</P>

The Serjeants are to be divided equally to three Grand-divi&s;ions, and to March on the Right and Left Flanks, if the Regiment is three deep the Drummers are to fall in be|tween the fir&s;t &amp; &s;econd of each Grand-divi&s;ion; If the Regiment is &s;ix deep, then the Drummers are to fall in between the third and fourth Rank of each Grand-divi&s;ion. The Battalion in March|ing off are to open to their former di&s;tance four paces, for which end the Rear Ranks are not to move till tho&s;e in their Front have got to their proper di&s;tance. In Marching, the Major is to Salute on Hor&s;e-back, unle&s;s he commands the Regiment, which if he does, he is to March on Foot, and in the Colonel's Po&s;t, and Salute with his Half-Pike.</P>

All the Officers who March in the &s;ame Rank are to be very exact in performing their Motions together; the Motions may be taken from the Officer that Marches on the Right. After the Officers have Saluted, they are not to Bow their Heads in pa&s;&s;ing by the General, but to March with their Hats off, till they have pa&s;|&s;ed him about eight paces, and then to put them on; and when they have got twenty paces from the General, they are to reduce their Pike.

<P>The Officers having taken their Po&s;ts in the Front of the Battalion, the Major is to order one of the Gra|nadiers to beat the Drummer's Call, upon which the En&s;igns who are to carry the Colours and the Drum major, with one half or two thirds of the Drummers are to repair to the Head of the Com|pany of Granadiers, where the Drummers are to be formed into Ranks in the Rear of the En&s;igns facing outward.

Note, on &s;ending for the Colours the Compliment then paid by the Battalion is that of Shoulder'd Arms; but when the Colours are brought to the Regi|ment they are received with re&s;ted Arms, and the Drummers who remain beat a March, which is the rea&s;on that one third of the Drummers at lea&s;t remain with the Battalion. The &s;ame Com|pliment is paid to the Colours when they are &s;ent from the Battalion; but when the En&s;igns go for the Colours and return without them the Batta|lion is only to be Shoulder'd. As &s;oon as the Lieutenant comes to the place where the Co|lours are lodged, he is to draw up his Detach|ment three deep, and then order the Granadiers to fix their Bayonets, as follows: Poi&s;e your Firelocks; Re&s;t on your Arms; Draw your Bayonets; Fix your Bayonets; Recover your Arms; Re&s;t your Firelocks on your left Arm. After the&s;e Motions are performed the En&s;igns are to take the Colours, &amp; the Lieutenant marches back to the Battalion, in the &s;ame order that he came from it, the En&s;igns carrying their Co|lours advanced and letting them fly.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Lieutenant comes to the Batta|lion, he mu&s;t draw up his Detachment on the Right or Left Flank (according to which Flank
<PB N="16" REF="003633_0017_1002389F05ED0B48">he comes to fir&s;t) and halt his Men; but the En&s;igns with the Colours followed with the Drummers are to move on till they have ad|vanced a little before the Officers of the Batta|lion, and then Wheel to the Right or Left in|ward according to the Flank they are on, and March along the Front of the Officers till they come to their Po&s;ts in the Center, which they are to fall into. When the En&s;igns fall into their Po&s;ts, the Drum major is to Wheel the Drum|mers to the Front and March them about ten paces forward, then Halt, and after he has or|dered them to cea&s;e Beating, he is to &s;end them to their re&s;pective Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the En&s;igns with the Colours, and the Drummers have wheeled inwards, in order to March to the Center, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to Face to the Right (if they are drawn on the Left of the Battalion) and march along the Ranks to their former ground; the Lieutenant with the Front Rank of Granadiers marching between the Officers and Front Rank of the Battalion; but if they are drawn up on the Right of the Granadier Company, he is then to face his Detachment to the Left and march it a|long the Front of the Granadiers only, and as &s;oon as they come on their former Ground, he is to order them to Halt and immediately pro|ceed to unfix the Bayonets.</P>
<P>After this the Major is to order the Battalion to Shoulder their Arms. As &s;oon as the Colours are &s;ent back, as the Military phra&s;e is, the Drum|mers Call is to be beat at the Head of the Gra|nadiers; on which the En&s;igns with the Colours, and the Drum-major with the &s;ame number of
<PB N="17" REF="003633_0018_100238A09125FFD8">Drummers are to repair thither immediately, and draw up as before. The Lieutenant of Grana|diers are to order the &s;ame Detachment, or an equal number of Granadiers to fix their Bayonets and re&s;t them on their left Arms; and as &s;oon as the Major has ordered the Battalion to <HI>Pre&s;ent their Arms,</HI> he is to March back the Colours to the place where they are to be Lodged, the Drummers Beating the Troop as before. The En&s;igns are to carry the Colours back in the &s;ame manner they brought them, that is, advanced and flying; and as &s;oon as they arrive at the place, and the Detachment is drawn up, they are to furl their Colours and lodge them. When this is done, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to unfix and return their Bayo|nets, and re&s;t their Firelocks on their left Arms; after which he is to March back in the &s;ame manner he carried the Colours to the Bat|talion, unle&s;s he is ordered to di&s;mi&s;s his Men as &s;oon as the Colours are lodged; in which ca&s;e when the Bayonets are returned in &s;tead of pre&s;enting, he is to order them to re&s;t their Fire|locks, then Club and di&s;mi&s;s them with the Ruff of a Drum.</P>

<HEAD>Directions for Forming the <HI>SQUARE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUppo&s;ing there is four Platoons of Grana|diers, and &s;ixteen other Platoons, that con|&s;titute the Battalion: the Square may be formed by three Words of Command.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Form the Square.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>March.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Face Square.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
At the fir&s;t word of Command the two inward Platoons of Gra|nadiers, and the &s;ix Platoons on the Right, the &s;ix Platoons on the Left, Face all to the Right about on their left Heels, the Officers in the Front &amp; Rear of tho&s;e Platoons doing the &s;ame, as al&s;o the Serjeants who are po&s;ted in the Rear of tho&s;e Platoons. The two outward Platoons of Granadiers with their Officers, as al&s;o the two divi&s;ion of Drummers on the Flanks, face to the Right and Left inwards. The four Platoons in the Center keep their proper Front. At the &s;e|cond word of Command, <HI>March.</HI> The Platoons which faced to the Right about, Wheel inward, and as &s;oon as the Platoons which form the Right, Face, and tho&s;e that compo&s;e the Left, Face, have Wheeled a Quarter of the Circle, they are to &s;tand. Put the two Platoons on the Right of the Battalion and the two on the Left, being to compo&s;e the Rear Face, are to continue Wheel|ing, inwards, another Quarter of the Circle, by which the Right and Left Platoons of the Batta|lion join in the Center of the Rear Face.</P>
<P>The two Platoons of Granadiers which Faced to the Right about, Wheel at the &s;ame time with the Platoons of the Battalion, but in&s;tead of Wheeling on the extremity of the Flanks, they may incline inward, till the Granadiers in the Right come oppo&s;ite to the interval between
<PB N="20" REF="003633_0021_100238A96662D3F8">the &s;econd and third, and the Granadiers on the left till they come oppo&s;ite to the Interval be|tween the fourteenth and fifteenth Platoon, and then to Wheel and March directly in the Rear of tho&s;e Platoons, &s;o that tho&s;e Platoons of Granadiers will be on the Rear Angles, which they are to cover the two Platoons of Gra|nadiers which faced to the Right &amp; Left inwards are at the &s;ame time to March in a direct line, to the Right &amp; Left Flanks of the four Center Pla|toons, which &s;tood, and when they come to the Flanks of tho&s;e Platoons, they are to &s;tand, be|ing to form on the Front Angles. The Officers and Serjeants Face as the Platoons do, on which they are po&s;ted.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as the Men have Faced Square, the Colonel, Major, En&s;igns with the Colours, Ad|jutant and Drummers, March into the Square; and the Drummers are to be divided into four Divi&s;ions, placing one in the Rear of each Face, which the Drum major is to perform.</P>
<P>The Field Officers can have no fixed Po&s;t a&s;|&s;igned them.</P>
<P>The En&s;igns with their Colours, are to po&s;t them&s;elves in the Center of the Square</P>
