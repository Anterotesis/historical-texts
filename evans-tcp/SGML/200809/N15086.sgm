<P>How many who are openly regardle&s;s of its precepts of virtue, and pride them&s;elves in their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who&s;e external demeanor is not &s;o reprehen&s;ible, and who pay &s;ome attention to the outward duties of religion, is it not to be feared there are va&s;t numbers who are &s;trangers to its &s;pirit; who entertain unju&s;t ideas con|cerning it; who flatter them&s;elves they are the heirs of redemption, when their &s;ins are unab|&s;olved;

<P>And, it is pre&s;umed, you are now &s;en&s;ible, that until very lately, even your&s;elves were of the number of tho&s;e who are nominal pro|fe&s;&s;ors only of the go&s;pel, and, therefore, in that "broad way of iniquity that leadeth to de&s;truction!"</P>
<P>But, happily, through divine goodne&s;s, it is hoped, that you now have more perfect conceptions of Chri&s;tianity and of your &s;tate through &s;in!&mdash;That you are now convinced of its nature and demerits!&mdash;That you now, from principle, dete&s;t it; wi&s;h to be delivered from its penalty; to be liberated from its power; to po&s;&s;e&s;s holine&s;s of heart, and the favour of heaven!</P>
<P>YOU are, however, involved in di&s;tre&s;s. You weep for &s;in, without comfort! You &s;eek the divine favour; but do not obtain it! You are athir&s;t for the waters of life; but cannot ap|proach them! And, perhaps, &s;ome of you are tempted to conclude, that never was any &s;orrow equal to that with which you are afflicted!</P>
<P>BUT &s;uffer not your&s;elves to de&s;pair of de|liverance from your &s;tate of woe! And permit me to endeavour to mini&s;ter con&s;olation to

<P>On account of your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions you are expo&s;ed to the cur&s;e of the divine law: and of your&s;elves you are unable to appea&s;e heavenly ju&s;tice.

<P>And how many have there been who, while this change was in its accompli&s;hment, have for days, weeks, months, or, perhaps, even years, endure great perturbation of mind, and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit?</P>
<P>But there have been great numbers who have not been thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, before they en|joyed the con&s;olations of the go&s;pel; and many have no &s;ooner &s;orrowed for &s;in, but they have rejoiced in the manife&s;tations of the divine love towards them.</P>
<P>There is a great diver&s;ity in penitents with re&s;pect to their apprehen&s;ions of the nature of evil; the di&s;tre&s;s they experience by rea&s;on of their &s;ins, and the degrees of &s;atisfaction, peace and joy they are favoured with.</P>

<P>The advantages of prayer are many and great; particularly, by the due performance of this duty, your penitence for &s;in, faith in Chri&s;t, and love to God, will be increa&s;ed; you will have clearer apprehen&s;ions of divine truths; your affections will be &s;piritualized, and you will be enabled to ri&s;e &s;uperior to tho&s;e temptations by which you may be a&s;&s;aulted.</P>
<P>It hath been remarked, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for piety, have al&s;o been di&s;tingui&s;hed for their attention to devotion; the practice of which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to your proficiency in grace.</P>

<P>FOURTHLY: When you &s;hall obtain con&s;o|lation, through Chri&s;t, commemorate his death and pa&s;&s;ion, in the manner he hath pre&s;cribed.</P>

<P>This ordinance was typical of our delive|rance from eternal death, "through the &s;prink|ling of the blood of Chri&s;t,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 2.</NOTE> and was ho|noured by him until he ordained, in its place, a new Pa&s;chal Supper, on the evening imme|diately preceding his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>As this &s;ervice is explicitly enjoined on us,&mdash; "This do in remembrance of me;"&mdash;as it is in it&s;elf mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and is attended with great advantages to our&s;elves; to neglect it therefore, is to &s;in, not only again&s;t God, but al&s;o again&s;t our own &s;ouls!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="019154_0019_0FAA5DF280382AE8">FIFTHLY: Embrace each opportunity of hearing the divine word preached.</P>
<P>Should the preacher, at any time, happen to be of a denomination different from that by which you are di&s;tingui&s;hed, hear him without prejudice, and with a de&s;ire to receive edifica|tion from what he may deliver.</P>
<P>Remember that truth is truth, by whom&s;o|ever it is &s;poken; and that the preaching of <HI>no per&s;on whatever</HI> &s;hould be regarded by you, <HI>any farther</HI> than it is <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>&s;acred oracles.</HI></P>
<P>Some per&s;ons, that they may receive the greate&s;t advantage from the &s;ermons they hear, make a practice of reducing their texts, and al&s;o the &s;ub&s;tance of the di&s;cour&s;es, to writing; and it mu&s;t be granted that &s;uch conduct may be particularly beneficial, and render &s;ermons more permanently u&s;eful.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY: Avoid bigotry and a &s;pirit of re|ligious di&s;putation The former is reproachful to Chri&s;tianity, and is often productive of bad con&s;equences: and the latter, it is conceived, is attended with many more evil, than good effects. It is frequently &s;ubver&s;ive of the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and occa&s;ions, in men, wrath, hatred, pride, and other &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the fir&s;t age of the go&s;pel, when its profe&s;&s;ors were &s;eriou&s;ly concerned to obtain &s;alvation, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t affection for each other; they being, we are in|formed, "of one heart, and of one mind."</P>
<P>But when the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity began to be de&s;ti|tute of its &s;pirit, they divided into &s;ects and parties; en|tertained hatred and prejudice again&s;t one another, merely by rea&s;on they di&s;agreed in religious &s;entiments; and often for a particular &s;o immaterial as this, deprived each other of many earthly ble&s;&s;ings, and even of life it&s;elf! And, perhaps, with much greater zeal, than they executed ju&s;tice on per&s;ons guilty of the mo&s;t flagrant acts of wickedne&s;s!</P>
<P>The &s;acred writings give no countenance to religious prejudice, enmity, animo&s;ity and contention, but the re|ver&s;e. "Judge not," &s;ays our Lord, "that ye be not judged." Matt. vii. 1.</P>
<P>Before the Apo&s;tles had received the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, and, con&s;equently, while unacquainted with the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, they "&s;aw one ca&s;ting out devils in the name of Chri&s;t," and took upon them to "forbid him; becau&s;e he followed not with them." But their conduct, in this in&s;tance, was di&s;approved of by their divine Ma&s;ter. Mark ix. 38.</P>
<P>"Him that is weak in the &s;aith," &s;aith Saint Paul, "receive ye," (in affection) "but not to doubtful di&s;|putation."</P>
<P>He adds: "Who art thou that judge&s;t another man's &s;er|vant? To his own ma&s;ter he &s;tandeth or falleth."&mdash;"Why do&s;t thou judge thy brother? Or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? For we &s;hall all &s;tand before the judg|ment &s;eat of Chri&s;t." "Every one of us &s;hall give an ac|count of him&s;elf to God. Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more." Rom. xiv.</P>
<P>Happy would it be, if Chri&s;tians in general, were as &s;oli|citous to excel in piety, as apparently they are, in ortho|doxy of faith!&mdash;Is it not to be feared, there are many that are <HI>heretical</HI> in their <HI>practice,</HI> who <HI>pride them&s;elves</HI> in the <HI>truth</HI> of their <HI>principles?</HI></P>
<P>Uncharitable it would be, not to admit there are <HI>&s;ome,</HI> of every denomination of Chri&s;tians, who obtain &s;alvation. And if CHRIST <HI>him&s;elf</HI> receives into his kingdom, <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who differ from us in religious opinion and mode of wor|&s;hip, why &s;hould not WE receive <HI>&s;uch</HI> into the arms of affection?</P>
<P>If, in a &s;hort period, <HI>one heaven,</HI> will receive all the &s;aints on earth, wherefore &s;hould they not endeavour to be as affectionate to each other <HI>here,</HI> as they will be <HI>hereafter?</HI></P>
<P>And can Chri&s;tians, with equal mode&s;ty and certainty, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> regard any thing to be the <HI>te&s;t</HI> of <HI>error,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> as a <HI>life</HI> of <HI>impiety?</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT three years &s;ince, the Author of the preceding Addre&s;s, preached a Sermon, in Kingwood, in the State of New-Jer&s;ey, on the &s;ubject of Regeneration, which di&s;cour&s;e was then printed.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons, on whom, through divine goodne&s;s, it made &s;erious and happy impre&s;|&s;ions, reque&s;ted the Author to compo&s;e a prayer, adapted to their &s;ituation, and to an|nex it to the &s;ermon.</P>
<P>This reque&s;t was complied with; and that form of devotion is now re-printed, for the advantage of &s;uch per&s;ons of penitence as may read this pamphlet, and have occa&s;ion of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in their addre&s;&s;es to the Almighty.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>O THOU that art my Creator, pre&s;erver and benefactor! Again&s;t thee, O God! again&s;t thee have I &s;inned! With &s;hame and &s;orrow, I acknowledge and deplore my manifold tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, which render me mo&s;t unworthy of thy favour, and ju&s;tly expo&s;e me to thy indig|nation and wrath!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="019154_0039_0FAA5CCCA4BDBF18">But O thou who art a God of pity; that delighte&s;t not in the death of a &s;inner, but woulde&s;t rather he &s;hould turn from his wick|edne&s;s and live, look down, I humbly be&s;eech thee; in conde&s;cen&s;ive goodne&s;s look down from thy throne of mercy, and behold me in compa&s;&s;ion! Pardon, I intreat thee, my ini|quities, through the merits of thy beloved Son! Through the purity of his blood, may I be clean&s;ed from &s;inful defilement! Give peace to my troubled mind, and let me be|come an object of thy affection!</P>
<P>Deliver me, O Lord! I pray thee, not only from the puni&s;hment due to &s;in, but al&s;o from its power and dominion! Let it no longer reign in my mortal body! No longer may I be in bondage to the Prince of Darkne&s;s! No longer may I even incline tran&s;gre&s;s thy holy law! Through the power of thy grace, may all evil be mortified and &s;ubdued in me! Through the efficacy of thy &s;pirit, may my &s;oul be regenerated; be renewed, and tran&s;|formed into thy likene&s;s! May my mind be duly illuminated with the light of divine truth! May my affections be &s;upremely fixed on thee, O God! who art mo&s;t worthy of all love! And henceforth, may my life be intirely conformable to thy righteous will!</P>
<P>Though numerous foes may a&s;&s;ault me in the path of &s;alvation, yet, O Lord God of &s;trength! through thy aid, may they be van|qui&s;hed!

May I be enabled to triumph over all oppo&s;ition in the practice of religion; to go on from one degree of holine&s;s to another, and, at length, arrive to the fulne&s;s of chri&s;|tian perfection!</P>
<P>Ever be plea&s;ed to indulge me, O Lord, I be&s;eech thee! with the light of thy counten|ance! At all times may I be favoured with the con&s;olations and joys of thy holy &s;pirit! And may I be pre&s;erved from every thing that &s;hall be either offen&s;ive to thee; reproachful to chri&s;tianity, or injurious to my&s;elf! Particu|larly, from &s;piritual pride; from an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition, and a pre&s;umptuous confidence in my own ability to conflict with &s;in and Satan! As without thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance, O God! I cannot do any thing that is good, wilt thou, in mercy, incline and enable me &s;ucce&s;sfully to approach thee in all thy holy ways, that from thee I may receive a &s;upply of grace for all my &s;piritual wants! And prepare, O Lord! with ardour I implore thee; prepare my heart, in due &s;ea&s;on, to draw near, in an acceptable manner, to that holy &s;acrament, appointed by the merciful and divine Je&s;us, to be expre&s;&s;ive of his death, un|til he &s;hall come again! In mercy grant, that the emblems of his holy pa&s;&s;ion, may be re|ceived by me with the profounde&s;t reverence; and with the mo&s;t fervent gratitude, love and prai&s;e! That at this &s;acred banquet, each grace and virtue in me may be nouri&s;hed, e&s;tabli&s;hed,

and confirmed! And that a proper &s;en&s;e of the &s;ufferings of thy beloved Son, for the atone|ment of human guilt, may occa&s;ion me pro|perly to perceive the demerits of &s;in, and cau&s;e me to flee it with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation and abhorrence!</P>
<P>O Father of mercies, the God of love and of grace! What &s;hall be rendered unto thee for thy inconceivably rich and unmerited cle|mency, manife&s;ted to &s;inful men, through the Son of thy affection! How &s;hall I &s;ufficiently admire, adore, and prai&s;e thee, that I enjoy the glorious light of the go&s;pel! That not|with&s;tanding all my &s;ins, thou ha&s;t &s;o long waited to be gracious to me! And that thou ha&s;t now inclined my &s;oul to make my peace with thee, and to weep for my offences! O that my repentance may be &s;uch as &s;hall need not to be repented of! That my faith in Chri&s;t may increa&s;e in &s;trength! And that I may be thine, for ever thine!</P>
<P>Lord, humbly do I commit my&s;elf unto thee! To thee do I offer my&s;elf a &s;acrifice, both &s;oul and body, which is my rea&s;onable &s;ervice! O that thou woulde&s;t deign to accept of the unworthy offering! That thy arm of omnipotence may ever be extended for my &s;afety! That, through thy goodne&s;s, I may e&s;cape the temptations of the world, the fle&s;h and the devil, and at la&s;t enter into thy hea|venly kingdom!</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="019154_0042_0FAA5CD21FB5F738">Grant it, O Lord! thou who heare&s;t the petitions of humble &s;uppliants; grant it with humility and fervency I pray, for the &s;ake of the merits and mediation of the divine, com|pa&s;&s;ionate Je&s;us; to whom with thee and the Holy Gho&s;t, three Per&s;ons, but one God, be a&s;cribed all honour and glory, adoration and prai&s;e, now, henceforth, and for ever!
