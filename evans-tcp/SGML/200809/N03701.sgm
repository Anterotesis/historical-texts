<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THEN I &s;ee a Book well written for the <HI>In&s;truction of Mankind,</HI> I al|ways ways hope it will &s;pread its good Influences as far and wide as it finds Readers. But when I meet with a valuable Treati&s;e, who&s;e De&s;ign is to improve the &s;acred <HI>Skill of Preaching,</HI> I am ready to per&s;wade my&s;elf, <Q>Surely this will become a more exten&s;ive Benefit; and the good Influences of it will reach as many whole A&s;&s;emblies of Men, as there are Mini&s;ters who &s;hall happen to read it.</Q> For this Rea&s;on I cannot but take a &s;pecial Satisfaction in recommending the&s;e <HI>two Di&s;|cour&s;es</HI> to the World, which, in my Opinion, are founded upon the general Principles of Chri&s;tianity, and therefore invite the Peru&s;al of All, being writ|ten without the narrow Spirit of a Party. They &s;eem to be calculated for the common Good, nor have I ob&s;erv'd any Thing in them that can ju&s;tly give Di&s;gu&s;t, or awaken any rea&s;onable Re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, without Controver&s;y, that there are &s;ome Things wherein &s;everal of the Preachers of the <HI>pre&s;ent Time</HI> have the Advan|tage of our Learned and Pious Fathers: But there are other Excellencies in the Sermons of the <HI>Puri|tanical Age,</HI> which I would rejoice to find more &s;tudiou&s;ly revived and cultivated in our Day. A|mong
<PB N="viii" REF="004534_0006_100D64208AA616E8">
the&s;e I know none of more eminent Nece&s;&s;ity, Glory, and U&s;efulne&s;s, than tho&s;e <HI>two</HI> which are the Subjects of this little Book; I mean the <HI>Evangelical Turn of Thought</HI> that &s;hould run thro' our mini|&s;try, and the <HI>Experimental Way of Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on practical Subjects.</P>
<P>It hath been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that where a great and univer&s;al Neglect of <HI>preaching Chri&s;t</HI> hath prevailed in a Chri&s;tian Nation, it hath given a fatal Occa&s;ion to the Growth of <HI>Dei&s;m</HI> and <HI>Infide|lity;</HI> for when Per&s;ons have heard the Sermons of their Clergy, for many Years together, and find little of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in them, they have taken it into their Heads, that Men may be very good Men, and go &s;afe to Heaven without <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> and there|fore, tho' they dwell in a Land where the Go&s;pel is profe&s;s'd, they imagine there's no Need they &s;hould be <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> But what a Blot and Reproach would it be to our Mini&s;try, if <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Hea|thens</HI> &s;hould multiply among us, through &s;uch a wo|ful Neglect of preaching the <HI>peculiar Doctrines of Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, let us con&s;ider how little hath been our <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in compari&s;on of the Multitudes converted by our Fathers in the Day of their Mini&s;try. Hath not this been Matter of &s;ore Complaint the&s;e many Years pa&s;t? Now it is worth our Enquiry, whe|ther it may not be a&s;cribed to the <HI>Ab&s;ence of Chri&s;t</HI> in our Sermons. And what Rea&s;on indeed can we have to expect the <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> and Influence of the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> if we leave his Per&s;on, his Offices, his Grace, and his Go&s;pel, out of our Di&s;cour&s;es, or give but a &s;light and ca&s;ual Hint at the&s;e glorious Subjects, which ought to be our daily Theme? This is what our Author would put us in mind of in his <HI>fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="004534_0007_100D64220F740A18">And perhaps another Cau&s;e of our <HI>Want of Suc|ce&s;s</HI> hath been this, That we have too much left off the Way of our Fathers, in di&s;tingui&s;hing the Cha|racters of our Hearers, and dividing the Word a|right to Saints and Sinners, to the &s;tupid and the profane, the awaken'd and convinc'd, the mournful and penitent, the pre&s;umptuous and ob&s;tinate, the de&s;erted and de&s;pairing.</P>
<P>This Method appears eminently in the Labours of the former Age. Tho&s;e two great and good Men, Mr. <HI>Flavell,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> might be divided in their Sentiments on other Subjects, but you find this Conduct runs thro' all their practical Writings, This is a great Part of what the <HI>&s;econd Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> here recommends to us, under the Title of <HI>Experi|mental Preaching.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author indeed a&s;&s;umes not &s;o much to him&s;elf, as to addre&s;s any be&s;ides <HI>Students</HI> and <HI>Younger Mini&s;ters.</HI> But if in the <HI>middle Age of Life</HI> we &s;hould examine our Performances by the Light of this Treati&s;e, 'tis po&s;&s;ible we and our People might be Gainers by it.</P>
<P>Have we not been too often tempted to follow the <HI>Modi&s;h Way,</HI> and &s;peak to our Hearers in gene|ral Terms, as though they were all converted al|ready, and &s;ufficiently made Chri&s;tians by a Natio|nal Profe&s;&s;ion? Have not &s;ome of us &s;pent our la|bour to build them up in the Practice of Duties, without teaching them to &s;earch whether the Foun|dation has been laid in an entire Change and Re|novation of Heart? Do we lead them con&s;tantly to enquire into the inward State of their Souls, the &s;pecial Tempers and Circum&s;tances of their Spirits, their peculiar Difficulties, Dangers and Tempta|tions,
<PB N="x" REF="004534_0008_100D6424996CDD88">
and give them peculiar A&s;&s;i&s;tance in all this Variety of the Chri&s;tian Life?</P>
<P>With how much more Efficacy does the Word of God impre&s;s the Con&s;cience, when every Hearer finds him&s;elf de&s;cribed without the Preacher's per|&s;onal Knowledge of him? When his own &s;piritual State is painted to the Life, and (as it were) &s;et before his Eyes in the Language of the Preacher? When a Word of Conviction, Advice, or Comfort, is &s;poken &s;o pertinently to his own Ca&s;e, that he takes it as directed to him&s;elf. How much more powerful and more penetrating will our Sermons be, when tho&s;e who <HI>come into our A&s;&s;emblies</HI> &s;hall be <HI>convinced and judged,</HI> and have the <HI>Secrets of their Hearts made manife&s;t, and confe&s;s that God is in the mid&s;t</HI> of us <HI>of a Truth?</HI></P>
<P>The Peru&s;al of the&s;e excellent <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> in Manu&s;cript hath given me &s;o much Satisfaction, that I take a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure to think that the Pre&s;s will communicate them to the World, and then I hope for a further Share of Profit, by keeping them always at my Right Hand when I am preparing for the Service of the Sanctuary. May the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God teach tho&s;e who enter into the &s;acred Office, this holy Skill of <HI>winning</HI> Souls! May He awaken us all to &s;ee what may be mended in our Mini&s;trations, in order to publi&s;h the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t with more illu&s;trious and divine Succe&s;s!</P>

<HEAD><HI>DISCOURSE I.</HI> Of Preaching CHRIST. Addre&s;s'd to YOUNGER MINISTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE profe&s;s our&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and are, I hope, upon careful and rational Enquiry &s;atisfied that the Religion of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> comes from God; and that it is a mo&s;t glorious Di&s;pen&s;ation, not only for the &s;ublime Wonders of its Doctrine, and the Divine Pu|rity of its Precepts, but that it excels all other Religions in the Strength of its Motives, the Richne&s;s of its Promi&s;es, and the Sufficiency of the Divine Aid attending it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004534_0014_100D643165C53468">Now in all the peculiar Glories of this Reli|gion, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is interwoven, like <HI>Phidias</HI>'s Name in the Shield, which could not be effaced without de&s;troying the Shield it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Doctrines concerning <HI>Je&s;us</HI> make the Glory and Advantage of his Religion; and &s;o run through the whole, that <HI>preaching Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>preaching the Go&s;pel,</HI> are, in Scripture Style, &s;y|nonymous Terms: As in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 23.&mdash;ii. 2. and innumerable other Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>preaching of Chri&s;t</HI> is our Bu&s;ine&s;s, our Charge, and our Glory; but oh! <HI>who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e thing?</HI> Give me leave then, my dear Brethren and Friends, to remind my-&s;elf and You, what Regard a Mini&s;ter &s;hould have to our Redeemer in his Preaching and other Admini|&s;trations.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Let us make</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>the De&s;ign and End of our Preaching.</HI> If we &s;eek principally to plea&s;e Men, then are we not the Servants of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> If we look no farther than our own Humour, Reputation, or temporal Advantage, and expend our Talents to our own private U&s;e, how &s;hall we make up our Accounts to our Ma&s;ter? and what Reward can we expect from him?</P>
<P>Our ultimate End &s;hould be the per&s;onal Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> That the Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as God, is the ultimate End of the Go&s;pel, none can doubt: Nay, as a Creature, he is in his Perfections and Felicity, far &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the Creation;
<PB N="17" REF="004534_0015_100D6433A0C0B848">
&s;o that it is &s;aid of this divine Per&s;on, Heb. ii. 10. <HI>All things are for him, as well as by him.</HI> Is he not worth ten thou&s;and of us? More worth than the World? The only begotten Son of God, whom the highe&s;t Angels adore? Now if the Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Per&s;on, to the Honour of the Father, be the principal End in the divine Schemes and Actings, it &s;hould al&s;o be our high|e&s;t View and De&s;ign. Nor want we Motives of Gratitude to lead us to this: He is the Founder of our Religion, to whom all our Hopes are ow|ing: He has honoured us, and well de&s;erved that we &s;hould honour him: Nor is there any Danger of le&s;&s;ening the Honour of God the Father there|by, when we con&s;ider him, as the Scriptures re|pre&s;ent him, <HI>as one with the Father, the equal Image of the invi&s;ible God, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI></P>
<P>Again, as the Glory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Per&s;on &s;hould be our ultimate End; &s;o the advancing the King|dom of his Grace among&s;t Men, is to be the &s;ub|ordinate End.</P>
<P>The Recovery of fallen Creatures to Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s is the immediate De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel. Chri&s;t <HI>is come into the World to &s;ave Sin|ners,</HI> 1 Tim i. 15. And he &s;ends us to preach his Go&s;pel, that we might promote the &s;ame Sal|vation, <HI>That Men might live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, looking for that ble&s;&s;ed Hope,</HI> Tit. ii. 11, 12, 13. To make Men holy, to bring them to the Faith of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Imitation of him, and Communion with him, here and hereafter, to the Glory of the Father through <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be the
<PB N="18" REF="004534_0016_100D6436AF037620">
con&s;tant End of our Preaching. We &s;hould not think it enough to inform, to amu&s;e, to plea&s;e, to affect, but we mu&s;t aim farther than this, to bring them to tru&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and withal, to make them penitent and holy; and every Subject mu&s;t be managed with this View: And let it be our great Care, on a more &s;peculative Subject (as &s;uppo&s;e one of the &s;ublime Doctrines of Grace) &s;till to keep the End in view, and apply it practically, or our Labour is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us by all Means endeavour to &s;ave precious Souls, but yet aim at a higher End than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that we our &s;elves may be <HI>a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t unto God,</HI> 2 Cor. ii. 15. And then, though we mi&s;s of our &s;econdary End, and are not, as we could wi&s;h, <HI>the &s;avour of life unto life,</HI> unto any great Number; yet in being the <HI>&s;avour of death unto death to them that peri&s;h,</HI> we &s;hall be In&s;tru|ments of glorifying the Ju&s;tice and Long &s;uffering of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and be Witne&s;&s;es for God, <HI>that there has been a Prophet among&s;t them;</HI> our primary End is an&s;wered, <HI>our Labour is with the Lord,</HI> and we in the mean time are &s;upported, <HI>tho' I&s;rael be not gathered, for the word &s;hall not return empty.</HI></P>
<P>Nay farther, it is not enough that the Strain of our Preaching is adapted to the true De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, but we mu&s;t at Heart &s;incerely in|tend it; otherwi&s;e, tho' our Di&s;cour&s;es be un|exceptionable, yet if our De&s;igns be wrong and ba&s;e, though others be &s;aved through our Mini|&s;try, <HI>we &s;hall be ca&s;t-aways.</HI></P>

<P>When we are upon the Subject of Duty, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is by no means to be forgotten; for to per&s;uade Men to practical Godline&s;s, is one of the mo&s;t difficult Parts of a Mini&s;ter's Work. Men will hear with a curious Satisfaction a &s;peculative Di&s;|cour&s;e; and with &s;ome Joy attend to the Di&s;plays of God's Grace; nay, a <HI>Felix</HI> may tremble when Judgment is preached: Many indeed will bear to hear of Duty too; but to induce them to practi&s;e it, <HI>hic labor, hoc opus:</HI> Here we had need call in all Helps, and take all Advantages, which the Go&s;pel as well as the Light of Nature can furni&s;h.

But here I mu&s;t be more particular in explaining how we &s;hould regard <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in preaching Duty.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="004534_0020_100D316A73E7CBC8">1. Let us repre&s;ent Duty as the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Fruit of Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and Love to him. When by Faith we behold a crucified <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> do we not tremble at the Severity of Gods Ju&s;tice, and regret and hate tho&s;e Sins that occa|&s;ioned his Sorrows? When we farther con&s;ider, that <HI>by his &s;tripes we are healed,</HI> can we forbear <HI>to love him who hath fir&s;t loved us?</HI> Shall we not <HI>live to him that died for us?</HI> Can we have the Heart to <HI>crucify him afre&s;h?</HI> No, let us make his Service our Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Sufficience our Con|fidence, his Life our Example, and his Ble&s;&s;ings our Portion and Choice.</P>
<P>From &s;uch Actings of Faith and Outgoings of Love, flows that divine Temper which con&s;titutes the new Creature, and lays the Foundation of all right Go&s;pel-Obedience. Thus therefore let us continually trace Go&s;pel Duties up to their Foun|tain-head, that the People may learn, 'tis not out|ward Reformation that will &s;tand the Te&s;t in the Day of Judgment, but an inward Renewal of the Soul; that <HI>the tree mu&s;t fir&s;t be made good, before there can be any good fruit;</HI> and that all mu&s;t be done for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;ake, and flow from <HI>faith work|ing by love,</HI> Gal. v. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us enforce Duties with Motives re&s;pect|ing <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> as grateful Love to him &s;hould con|&s;train us; as Fear of his Wrath &s;hould awe us; as we would approve our &s;elves the Di&s;ciples and Followers of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> as we would enjoy Commu|nion with him; as we would promote his Honour and Intere&s;t; and as we would have Joy, and not Confu&s;ion, at his appearing. Not that we &s;hould
<PB N="23" REF="004534_0021_100D63882E5D3F58">
neglect any Motives which the Light of Nature can furni&s;h, and are level to the Capacities of the People: We have need enough of all; but if we go no further than the&s;e, our Exhortations will want far the greate&s;t Part of their Weight: We mu&s;t <HI>be&s;eech and exhort by the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> 1 The&s;&s; iv. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us con&s;ider Duties, as to be performed by the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> Telling the People, that our Fruitfulne&s;s depends on our being engrafted into this Vine; and that a Holy Walk is being <HI>led by the Spirit;</HI> and when we do good, it is <HI>not we, but the grace of God that is in us;</HI> that out of a &s;en&s;e of Weakne&s;s, <HI>we mu&s;t be made &s;trong, and do all things through Chri&s;t &s;trengthning us,</HI> Phil. iv. 13.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="4">IV. <HI>Let us deliver our &s;elves in a Style becoming the Go&s;pel of</HI> Chri&s;t: Not with <HI>great &s;welling words of vanity,</HI> or in the Style of the Heathen Sophi&s;ts, or Words that <HI>Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth,</HI> and may perhaps &s;ound be&s;t in our own Ears; but let us u&s;e <HI>great plainne&s;s of &s;peech,</HI> and &s;eek to find out &s;uch <HI>acceptable words,</HI> as may be&s;t reach the Under&s;tanding and Affections of the bulk of an Auditory.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004534_0022_100D638A331C4A20">As for the affectionate Part of a Di&s;cour&s;e, Brethren, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon a View of antient and modern Learning, you allow that the Men of the Ea&s;t, and next to them the antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> ex|celled in Fire, and Works of the Imagination; and that the Moderns inhabiting milder we&s;tern Climates, even the <HI>French</HI> (from whom upon many Accounts we &s;hould expect the mo&s;t of this Sort) produce but an empty Fla&s;h, in compari&s;on of the &s;olid Heat of the Antients; and rather a|mu&s;e us with little Delicacies, than by ma&s;terly Strokes command our whole Souls.

<P>And now, Brethren, let me lay before you &s;ome Rea&s;ons and Motives to back this friendly Admonition concerning <HI>preaching Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(I.) 'Tis the way to have our Labours accep|ted of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to have Communion with him in our Work: &mdash; Even <HI>Paul</HI> cries out, <HI>Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?</HI> With how much more rea&s;on have we? Does not our chearful Progre&s;s in our Work depend on a divine <HI>Afflatus,</HI> and the Spirit di&s;pen&s;ed by <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> But
<PB N="25" REF="004534_0023_100D638C7208BB28">
if we take no Notice of him in our Preaching, and do not di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves from the moral Philo&s;ophers of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> how can we expect any more of this enlivening and encouraging Pre|&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> than they had; nay, we have le&s;s ground to expect it, if we wilfully &s;light and &s;lur &s;o noble a Revelation, which they were never favour'd with.</P>
<P N="2">(II.) 'Tis the way to win Souls to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and make lively Chri&s;tians. The Succe&s;s of the Go&s;|pel is certainly no le&s;s owing to the Power of its Motives, than to the Clearne&s;s, Fulne&s;s, and Pu|rity of its Precepts. The&s;e peculiar Motives of the Go&s;pel have all &s;uch a Re&s;pect to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that they are enervated if he be di&s;regarded: The Go&s;pel Scheme is what God in his Wi&s;dom has pitch'd upon to reform Mankind, and &s;ave them; and he &s;eems in Honour concerned to crown it with greater Succe&s;s than any other Scheme what|&s;oever; <HI>the preaching of Chri&s;t crucified is the power of God,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 23, 24 If we maim the Go&s;pel, and &s;uppre&s;s a good Part of it, we can expect but a very defective Succe&s;s in the Nature of Things; nay, may we not fear God's Honour is concerned in &s;uch Ca&s;e to bla&s;t us, and we &s;hall be like to labour almo&s;t in vain.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervation agrees with this Theory: The great Ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on, who have le&s;s regard to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in their preaching, may, indeed, have a Charm for one of an hundred, who have a Ta&s;te of the Beauties of fine Rea&s;oning, and be of u&s;e to them, whil&s;t the Bulk of an Auditory is a&s;leep: Alas! with what Heart can we go on, entertain|ing
<PB N="26" REF="004534_0024_100D638F62301EF8">
two or three, to the &s;tarving of mo&s;t of the Souls in an Auditory. May we not al&s;o ob&s;erve a happier Effect of a Strain prudently evangelical on Chri&s;tians them&s;elves; that they who &s;it un|der it are more lively, zealous, ready to every good Work, and heavenly-minded, than tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who have heard le&s;s of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="3">(III.) It is a direct Imitation of the Apo&s;tles of <HI>Chri&s;t: Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, whil&s;t upon Earth, preached the Go&s;pel in Parables, in a concealed Manner, di&s;tantly and with re&s;erve: He could not &s;o fully take the Advantage of his Re&s;urrection, Satis|faction, A&s;cen&s;ion, and the like, not yet done, made or proved: He had many things to &s;ay, which his Di&s;ciples could not then bear, but he declares them afterward by his Spirit in his A|po&s;tles: They therefore are the true Pattern of our preaching, now, after the My&s;tery of Re|demption is brought to light, and hath its full Evidence.</P>
<P>How then did the Apo&s;tles preach <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> 'Tis endle&s;s to attempt a full Detail of Particulars; any part of the Apo&s;tolical Writings is Authority &s;uf|ficient to our Purpo&s;e; and therefore I've been &s;paring in Quotations all along, as needle&s;s, to tho&s;e who will look into the&s;e Writings with this View. And here we don't de&s;ire to alledge or in&s;i&s;t upon any Pa&s;&s;ages in their Writings, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be writ and in&s;erted for Rea|&s;ons peculiar to that Age and Country in which the Apo&s;tles wrote, and in which perhaps we are not &s;o much obliged to imitate them in our preach|ing; for what will remain after all the&s;e are put

out of the Account, will, I am &s;atisfied, be as full to our Purpo&s;e, as the&s;e that are &s;truck off.</P>
<P>I'll only then, by way of Specimen, &s;elect &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles Di&s;cour&s;es on Duties mo&s;t moral, where we are apte&s;t to forget a mention of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or re&s;pect to him, that it may at once appear the Apo&s;tles &s;hunned not the pre&s;&s;ing &s;uch Duties, or a regard to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in the treating on them.</P>
<P>I <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 8. Hone&s;ty is pre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e Mo|tives&mdash;the <HI>unrighteous thieves and extortioners, &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God</HI> (which in the Style of the New Te&s;tament is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Kingdom of Grace and Glory.)&mdash;That Chri&s;tians <HI>are con|verted by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and ju&s;tified by his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 15. Cha&s;tity is enjoyned, as <HI>our bodies are members of Chri&s;t, as we are one &s;pirit with him, temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, and bought with a price.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. and ix. Alms is recommended, as it will bring a large Tribute of <HI>prai&s;e to God for our &s;ubjection to the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t&mdash;and Chri&s;t became poor for our &s;akes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tit.</HI> iii 2 Evil &s;peaking is forbidden, becau&s;e <HI>we were fooli&s;h and wicked; but the grace of God has made the difference; not for our righteou&s;ne&s;s, but of his free mercy he has regenerated us, and given us his holy Spirit, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we are ju&s;tified, and heirs of glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004534_0026_100D6393EB4A0800"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. Subjects are commanded to obey Magi&s;trates, becau&s;e <HI>the Go&s;pel-day is come, and we &s;hould put on Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>

<P>Now what is there in the&s;e Motives peculiar to one Age or Nation? Are not all the&s;e as good now as formerly? And are Men &s;o ready in their Duty, that we have no need of them?</P>
<P>Nay, it is worth Ob&s;ervation, that the Apo&s;tles do not confine them&s;elves to Motives peculiarly adapted to the Duty they are pre&s;&s;ing, and which &s;erve to enforce one Duty rather than another; but, as you may look back &amp; &s;ee, when &s;uch proper Motives are not at hand, they take without any &s;cruple common or general ones, which will e|qually enforce any Duty what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould not we introduce the Pecu|liarities of the Go&s;pel on all Occa&s;ions, as frequent|ly as the Apo&s;tles did? If our Schemes of Theo|logy will not allow us, we have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="29" REF="004534_0027_100D63962D971CB0">
we are in a different Scheme from the Apo&s;tles. Are we afraid Men will make perver&s;e u&s;e of &s;uch Doctrines as the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed for Motives? The Apo&s;tles cho&s;e to venture it, and why &s;hould not we? If we will not dare to preach &s;uch a Go&s;pel as may be perverted by Men of corrupt Minds to their own Injury, we mu&s;t not expect to be In&s;truments of any Good: If we'll be <HI>the &s;avour of life</HI> to &s;ome, we mu&s;t expect to be <HI>the &s;avour of death</HI> to others, or not preach at all.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s even the <HI>Remon&s;trant</HI> Scheme (which, I think, con&s;iderably &s;inks the Doctrines of Grace) does allow room to regard <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> abundantly more than mo&s;t Preachers of that Set do: I would meet them on their own Principles: What hinders their frequently inculcating the Merits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> the Depravity of our Natures, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, the Aids of Grace, and Union and Communion with <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> The&s;e Topicks, it were to be hoped, might have their Effect: But alas! how few of the <HI>Remon&s;trants</HI> improve to Advan|tage &s;o much of the Go&s;pel as they hold and re|ceive: And it makes me le&s;s inclined to this Scheme, that it &s;o generally draws tho&s;e that em|brace it into a Strain of Preaching, even on prac|tical Subjects, &s;o different from that of the Apo|&s;tles; and inclines them, I know not how, to &s;up|pre&s;s tho&s;e glorious Motives (which yet their own Principles might allow) by which the Apo&s;tles enforced Go&s;pel Duties.</P>
<P N="4">(IV) So only &s;hall we de&s;erve the Name of Preachers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;Only did I &s;ay? I am a|fraid this may &s;ound too har&s;h &mdash;Come let us

put the Matter as &s;oft and candid as common Sen&s;e will allow us&mdash; So &s;hall we mo&s;t evident|ly or be&s;t de&s;erve this honourable Title.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t a Preacher keeps off from the Peculia|rities of the Go&s;pel, and &s;ays nothing but what the Light of Nature would al&s;o &s;ugge&s;t and autho|rize, give me leave to &s;ay, a Stranger might po&s;|&s;ibly doubt whether he is a Dei&s;t or a Chri&s;tian; the Que&s;tion is like an imperfect Mathematical Problem, which equally admits of different So|lutions.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Gho&s;ts of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Seneca</HI> to come, meer Strangers, into an A&s;&s;embly where one was haranguing the People in this ab&s;tracted Man|ner; I am apt to think <HI>Seneca</HI> would claim him as a Philo&s;opher of his own Sect and Religion. Now if <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould al&s;o make his claim to him as a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> how could the Que&s;tion be decided without allowing <HI>Seneca</HI> to be a Preacher of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o.</P>

<P>No que&s;tion you may have heard many hone&s;t People expre&s;s their Di&s;&s;atisfaction with many Preachers, in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e: <Q>They go on con&s;tantly in a general Way that does not come clo&s;e to the Heart, reaches not my Ca&s;e and Ex|perience, and I cannot edify by them.</Q>&mdash;Their Complaint is not altogether without Meaning or Rea&s;on, as I hope you'll be convinc'd by and by.</P>
<P>To keep a little in view that Pa&s;&s;age of Scrip|ture I've mentioned, the <HI>dividing the Word</HI> may mean the&s;e four Things.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Going through the variety of Go&s;pel Subjects:</HI> Declaring the whole Coun&s;el of God, the Doc|trines of Grace, Threatnings, Promi&s;es, and Du|ties of Morality; and giving each its due Pro|portion.</P>
<P>Some finding their Thoughts flow mo&s;t readily and affectionately on the Doctrines of Grace, and that by the&s;e they be&s;t command the Affections of the Hearers, are altogether upon them; and neglect to <HI>teach the people to ob&s;erve what Chri&s;t has commanded them</HI> I bear many of them wit|ne&s;s they have a <HI>zeal for God,</HI> but I wi&s;h it were more <HI>according to knowledge:</HI> They do not &s;ure &s;ufficiently con&s;ider that Holine&s;s is the De&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity; and our Preaching on other Heads, is in order the better to enforce Duty, and make Men like to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="004534_0034_100D63A55171E1A0">I am afraid, from what I've ob&s;erved, that this Strain of Preaching will encrea&s;e the Number of &s;uch Hearers, whom our Saviour de&s;cribes by the &s;tony Ground in the Parable of the Sower; name|ly, &s;uch who are all Notion and Affection, with a forward Profe&s;&s;ion; but have an un&s;ubdued Will, no Root in them&s;elves, and bring forth no fruit to God. This Strain, I fear, though it brings many toward <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> will bring but few &s;afely to him: Many of their Hearers, with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> much in their Mouths, will prove but Hypocrites &s;ettled on their Lees, and Slaves to Lu&s;t. Nor is this Strain more happy for the uniform Growth of the &s;incere Chri&s;tian: They that fit under it, are too frequently low, imperfect, and partial in prac|tical Godline&s;s; di&s;temper'd with Conceit and prepo&s;terous Zeal for Words and Phra&s;es, and Things of little or no Con&s;equence; perplexed and perplexing others with a thou&s;and ground|le&s;s Scruples; <HI>children in under&s;tanding,</HI> and it were happy were they &s;o in Malice too; but a|las! their Narrowne&s;s of Mind infects the Heart with uncharitable Affections to Chri&s;tians of diffe|rent Per&s;wa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Others having not arrived at the Reli&s;h of the Doctrines of Grace them&s;elves, &s;uppre&s;s them in their Preaching, and are altogether on Morality; enforcing it with no Motives of the Go&s;pel, ex|cept &s;ome of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;ed to Fear.&mdash;&mdash; The&s;e, if they are Ma&s;ters of much Fire, may convince &s;ome; but it fares with mo&s;t of their Convicts, as with the Man in the Parable, out of whom the unclean Spirit went for a while; hut finding his Hou&s;e empty, returned with &s;even more; and

the latter End of &s;uch is wor&s;e than the Beginning. &mdash;Or el&s;e, the awakened Hearer takes up with a proud Dependance upon a mi&s;taken, external, and Phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash; Or el&s;e the convinced Sinner, not being by his Teacher led to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> proceeds not, &s;ettles not, but abiding long under the doubtful Concern, is wearied with it, weary of it, and comes to nothing; which &s;eems to be the thought in <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> xiii. 13. <HI>Ephraim is an unwi&s;e &s;on; he &s;hould not &s;tay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</HI>&mdash;Or la&s;tly, if any are converted under his Mini&s;try, 'tis very u&s;ual that they are forced to de&s;ert it, to find rich|er and &s;weeter Pa&s;ture for their Souls.</P>
<P>Some of their Hearers may po&s;&s;ibly prefer this Strain of Preaching; but it does not thence follow they are the better for it: And here I'll recite a Paragraph out of <HI>Remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages in the Life of a private Gentleman.</HI> <Q>Spiritual &s;earching Di&s;cour&s;es I did not &s;o much &s;avour as meer moral Doctrines; tho' God knows too immoral my&s;elf.&mdash; The Hopes I had conceived of the Strength of my good Re&s;olutions render'd them grateful&mdash;<HI>Se|neca</HI>'s <HI>Morals</HI> I read with great Plea&s;ure&mdash; Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s <HI>Saints Re&s;t</HI> frighted me, &s;o in read|ing a few Pages, I threw it by!</Q></P>
<P>Thus with Regret he tells us what little Pro|fit he had in that Way, of his Fondne&s;s of which he was a&s;hamed, when he came to be of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Mind, <HI>to count all dro&s;s and dung that he might gain Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="004534_0036_100D63A9CAFD2FC8">II. <HI>The putting of a Thought in &s;everal di&s;tinct Views and Lights for different Purpo&s;es and De|&s;igns.</HI> The &s;acred Writers are herein our Pat|tern, and that not by Chance, but for wi&s;e Rea|&s;ons. One View is de&s;igned to rai&s;e one Affecti|on, another View, to excite another of a diffe|rent Sort: And farther, one of the Views is de|&s;igned as an Antidote again&s;t the Poi&s;on, which the Corruption of Mens Hearts might draw out of the other.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, the Terms and Way of our Ju&s;tification and Salvation are frequently &s;tated thus&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>That we mu&s;t be found in Chri&s;t, having on the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith,</HI> Phil. iii. 9. and <HI>we mu&s;t be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him,</HI> 2 Cor. v. 21.</P>
<P>And this View is exqui&s;itely adapted to hum|ble us, to draw forth Love and Gratitude, and encourage our Hopes and Dependance.</P>
<P>But le&s;t this Phra&s;eology alone made u&s;e of, &s;hould beget Security, at other Times we are told&mdash;</P>
<P>That <HI>by works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only; and that faith without works is dead,</HI> Jam ii. 24, 26. and that the Enquiry at the la&s;t Day &s;hall be, who has <HI>fed the hungry, cloathed the naked?</HI> &amp;c. Matt. xxv.</P>
<P>And mo&s;t commonly the&s;e two Views are uni|ted in the &s;ame Paragraph; that one may prevent
<PB N="40" REF="004534_0037_100D63AB4FC7B410">
the ill Con&s;equences Man's Perver&s;ene&s;s would draw from the other: As Phy&s;icians finding &s;ome dangerous Effect likely to follow from a Drug of &s;overeign Virtue, mix &s;ome other with it to pre|vent the fatal Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>So we are &s;aid to be <HI>elect according to the fore|knowledge of God, through &s;anctification of the Spi|rit unto obedience, and &s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 2.</P>
<P>Again we are told, that <HI>by grace we are &s;aved through faith, the gift of God, not of works; for we are his workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t unto good works,</HI> Eph. ii. 8.9, 10.</P>
<P>I may give another In&s;tance, in the different Ways the Scripture &s;peaks of Power and Duty.</P>
<P>Sometimes we are told, that <HI>we cannot come to Chri&s;t except the Father draw,</HI> John vi 44. That <HI>without Chri&s;t we can do nothing,</HI> John xv. 5. That <HI>if we live, it is not we, but Chri&s;t that liveth in us,</HI> Gal. ii. 20.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Views tend to hide Pride from Man, to create a Diffidence of our&s;elves, and to centre our Hopes and Dependance in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But le&s;t the &s;lothful and wicked Servant &s;hould make his Impotence his Excu&s;e; we are called upon to <HI>turn and make us new hearts,</HI> exhorted to <HI>ask and we &s;hall receive,</HI> and are a&s;&s;ured <HI>God will give the Spirit to them that ask him,</HI> Luke xi. 9, 13.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004534_0038_100D3168E5D58FE8">And how happily are the&s;e two Views united in Phil. ii. 12, 13. <HI>Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that work|eth in you to will and to do.</HI></P>
<P>Now, le&s;s skilful Dividers of the Word deal entirely in one of the&s;e Views only, and neglect the other; and whil&s;t they are labouring to ex|cite one good Affection, they rai&s;e another of a bad Tendency together with it: To this in part is owing that there are &s;o many low or di&s;tempe|red Chri&s;tians. Nor is this Partiality more happy at effecting the real Conver&s;ion of Sinners, who generally under &s;uch Management are either left a&s;leep, and &s;ettled in a fond Conceit of their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or el&s;e <HI>&s;tumble at the rock of of|fence,</HI> (in a different Manner indeed from what the <HI>Jews</HI> did) thinking to find by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> a Way to Heaven without Holine&s;s or moral Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Di&s;tinctly explaining and enforcing particu|lar Duties, and oppo&s;ing particular Sins.</HI> It is true, the whole Scheme of Go&s;pel Duty is dedu|cible from the general Heads of Faith and Love; but alas! mo&s;t Mens Minds are &s;low, confu&s;ed, and erroneous in long Deductions, and it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to lead them on in every Step, and to &s;hew what particular Duties to God, our Neigh|bour, and our Selves, will flow from the&s;e Prin|ciples, and are nece&s;&s;ary to make the Man of God perfect. We mu&s;t particularly teach them to <HI>add to their faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly-kindne&s;s and charity,</HI> if we would not leave them <HI>blind and unfruitful,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="004534_0039_100D63B156094FC8">
2 Pet. i. 7. And we &s;hould in a particular Man|ner &s;peak of <HI>the fruits of the Spirit, as love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, and temperance;</HI> and at proper Sea&s;ons explain and enforce each of them, <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 22, 23 We &s;hould apply the Lamp of the Word to detect and di&s;grace all the particular <HI>works of darkne&s;s,</HI> and to make manife&s;t <HI>the fruits of the fle&s;h; &s;uch as adultery, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, wrath, &s;trife, &s;editions, here&s;ies, envyings, murders, drunkenne&s;s, revellings, and &s;uch like,</HI> Gal. v. 19, 20, 21.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould read to a &s;ick Per&s;on a learned Lec|ture of the Benefit of Health, and exhort him to take care to recover it; but never enquire into the Nature of his Di&s;ea&s;e, or pre&s;cribe proper Me|thods and Medicines for the Cure; he would hardly acquie&s;ce in me for his Phy&s;ician, or re&s;ign the Care of his bodily Health to me.</P>
<P>Nor is it a more likely Way to the Soul's Health to re&s;t in general Exhortations to Holine&s;s only, without di&s;tinctly handling the &s;everal Branches thereof, and Sins oppo&s;ite thereunto.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Particularly applying to the &s;everal Ca&s;es, Tempers, and Experiences of the Hearers.</HI> Be&s;ides many Thoughts &s;uited in general to all Ca&s;es, there might properly ari&s;e in the Application of mo&s;t Subjects, Thoughts di&s;tinctly proper to the Converted and Unconverted, to notional Hypo|crite, and meer Morali&s;t, to Mourners, to Back|&s;liders and lazy Chri&s;tians, and at &s;everal Times to a much greater Variety of Characters, and Per&s;ons.</P>

<P>Brethren, from your Acquaintance with the Scriptures, you'll ea&s;ily perceive that I could as happily run this Specimen much farther thro' the &s;acred Writings. And if you peru&s;e the Wri|tings of the mo&s;t powerful &amp; &s;ucce&s;sful Preachers, particularly the <HI>Puritan</HI> Divines, you'll &s;ee that they herein imitated the great Leaders of the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; and were large in their par|ticular Application to &s;everal Sorts of Per&s;ons; &s;uiting their Di&s;cour&s;es to all the Variety of the Hearts of Men, and Sorts &amp; Frames of Chri&s;tians, according to the true Precepts of Oratory and Chri&s;tianity. In this Way they found their own Hearts warmed, and thus they reached the Hearts

of their Hearers; whil&s;t many were imagining the Mini&s;ter had been told of their Ca&s;e, and made the Sermon for them: and &s;o was verified that Pa&s;&s;age in Heb. iv. 12. <HI>The word of God is quick and powerful&mdash;a di&s;cerner of thoughts and intents of the heart.</HI></P>
<P>Now what Succe&s;s can we rea&s;onably expect, if we do not take into clo&s;e Con&s;ideration the Ca&s;e of our &s;everal &s;piritual Patients?</P>
<P>If a Man profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> &s;hould admini&s;ter or give out one con&s;tant Medicine for Fevers, and another for Con&s;umptions, and &s;o for other Di&s;tempers, without con&s;idering the Age, Con&s;ti|tution, Strength, and Way of Living of his Pa|tient; and not vary his Method and Medicines as tho&s;e varied; we &s;hould hardly call this the regular Practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick:</HI> Nor can I think this general and undi&s;tingui&s;hing Way will be more &s;afe, or likely to an&s;wer its End, in <HI>Divinity</HI> than in <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>

<P>Above all then, carefully &s;tudy your own Hearts, and preach over the ruder Sketches of your Sermons to your &s;elves fir&s;t; by which Means the corre&s;ponding Workings of your own Hearts and Affections may furni&s;h you with pro|per

Thoughts wherewith to apply clo&s;ely to all, who&s;e Temper, and Experience, and Ca&s;e is like your own: for what is &s;upplied to your imperfect Notes, out of the applicatory Meditations of your own Minds on the Subject, will very probably, according to the u&s;ual way of the Spirit, happily and powerfully reach tho&s;e of the &s;ame Make in like Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But alas! one Man's Experience falls far &s;hort of all the Variety of Men's Hearts, and of the Spirit's Work; nay, tho&s;e who&s;e Heads are turn|ed for clo&s;e and regular Thought, and who&s;e Time has been &s;pent in Study and Letters, as they go on more rationally and evenly in Religion, have le&s;s variety of Experience, than many of a different Mold and Way of thinking. Here it will be needful then to look out of our &s;elves, and take a larger View, in order to be acquainted with Ca&s;es and Tempers different from our own; and with &s;uch Methods of the Spirit's Work, as we our &s;elves have never experienced, but many others have. Now the be&s;t and original Way of getting this Acquaintance with Men, and with God's Workings in them, (and I may add of Sa|tan's Workings al&s;o) is by conver&s;ing freely with the &s;erious People of our Flock.</P>
<P>I know your Thoughts will prevent me with an Objection: You'll &s;ay, this is almo&s;t impracti|cable, e&s;pecially among&s;t Per&s;ons of Politene&s;s and Figure; the&s;e alas! too rarely will u&s;e any &s;uch Freedom with us, in laying open their Hearts, and communicating their Experiences to us, as to give us the needful Information. &mdash; If we ever
<PB N="52" REF="004534_0049_100D63C76403CD88">
do arrive at any Acquaintance with the Expe|rience of Chri&s;tians, 'tis little thanks to &s;uch as the&s;e; they expect we &s;hould preach &s;uitably to them, and that with as much rea&s;on as <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar</HI> demanded of the Wi&s;e Men to interpret a Dream they knew not. The middle and lower Sort of People indeed, are more unre&s;erved to grave Mini&s;ters of Age and Standing; but will hardly u&s;e the &s;ame Freedom with young Men.</P>
<P>To help you over this Difficulty, I would ob|&s;erve; that as for <HI>the Polite,</HI> and <HI>Men of &s;ome Thought and Reading,</HI> your own Experience, with the Allowances and Corrections a moderate Skill in Human Nature will enable you to make, may lead you into happy Conjectures at their Way of Thinking: Be&s;ides, in the time of their Vi&s;itation, under &s;ome &s;ore Affliction, you &s;hall find them more communicative; and an Hour's free Di&s;|cour&s;e, with &s;uch as can give a rational and intel|ligible Account of them&s;elves, in a Sea&s;on when they are di&s;po&s;ed to do it, is as valuable and u&s;e|ful, as it is rare and difficult to enter into.</P>
<P>Again, have an Eye upon <HI>the &s;erious Youth,</HI> whom Nature and Providence has de&s;igned to place in a &s;uperior Cla&s;s; and e&s;pecially at a Time when the Impre&s;&s;ions of Religion are new to them: You &s;hall find them more open than elder Per|&s;ons, if you court their Intimacy, and relieve their Ba&s;hfulne&s;s: And if you can &s;ee into the Heart of a Youth, then with the proper Allow|ances for the Alterations that Age and Bu&s;ine&s;s will make, you may pretty well gue&s;s at their Turn of Mind in more advanced Years.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="004534_0050_100D63C9976B4128">With the Generality of <HI>&s;erious and more ad|vanced Chri&s;tians,</HI> there needs not &s;o much Nice|ty, to get into &s;uch a &s;piritual Intimacy with them as we de&s;ire; the laying a&s;ide Nicety and Cere|mony, and getting into &s;uch a grave good-natu|red Way as our Character requires, is more than half-way to our Purpo&s;e: Where this is in&s;ufficient to encourage the People to Freedom, lead them into it by communicating fir&s;t, either what your &s;elves have experienced, under the Name of a third Per&s;on (if Mode&s;ty or Prudence require) or el&s;e what you have learned from others, with|out betraying the Confidence they have put in you: By the&s;e Methods we &s;hall &s;eldom fail of drawing &s;erious People on to &s;uch a Freedom, as will be of U&s;e to them and our&s;elves. &mdash; If we heartily go about it, we are pretty &s;ure to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I may farther Hint at a compendious Way for the gaining much Knowledge of Men's Hearts in a little Time. <HI>viz.</HI> If you have any tolerable Skill in the different Tempers and Complexions of Mankind, di&s;tribute in your Thoughts your People into Cla&s;&s;es, according to their natural Ge|nius and Temper, and &s;elect one of each Cla&s;s to be more particularly acquainted with; for among&s;t tho&s;e whom Nature has formed alike, you &s;hall find upon farther Enquiry, a &s;trange Uniformity in the Spirit's Work and Way of Proceeding with them.</P>
<P>I might recommend a Way of knowing the&s;e things at &s;econd Hand, <HI>viz.</HI> from the mo&s;t po|pular and experimental Authors; but this way is far inferior to the other; and we &s;hall but faintly

paint any Phaenomenon of the Heart, by copying another Picture; 'tis infinitely preferable to do it from the Life. Yet would I earne&s;tly recom|mend the Peru&s;al of &s;uch Authors, as deal much in an experimental Strain, and have been very &s;ucce&s;sful in it; but with a different De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> That we may learn from them, how to de&s;cribe, in a di&s;creet and lively Manner, &s;uch Ca&s;es as we our &s;elves have ob&s;erved; and how to addre&s;s properly to tho&s;e Ca&s;es, with the like Thoughts and Expre&s;&s;ions, as have in the Cour&s;e of their Preaching happily an&s;wered the End.</P>
<P>After all, rightly to divide the Word of Truth, with true Wi&s;dom, is a Matter of no &s;mall Diffi|culty; but if we carefully and diligently go about it, with a Zeal for our Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t, and &s;en|&s;ible of our own In&s;ufficience, <HI>asking wi&s;dom of God,</HI> we know <HI>he giveth liberally,</HI> and will &s;ure|ly make us <HI>wi&s;e to win &s;ouls,</HI> to the Honour of his Name, and our own <HI>rejoicing in the day of the Lord Je&s;us;</HI> to whom with the Father and Holy Spirit, that one God whom we adore, be paid the highe&s;t Honours and Prai&s;es to eternal Ages. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE good Acceptance which the two preceeding Di&s;cour&s;es met with, when they were fir&s;t publi&s;hed by the Author, (a lit|tle before his Death) and the &s;peedy Demand of a &s;econd E|dition, together with the fre|quent Enquiries which have been made for them &s;ince they have been out of Print, encourages this Republication of them. Were it proper for me to add any thing to that Recom|mendation which is prefixed to them, I might mention the Acceptance which they have al&s;o met with in Foreign Parts. For, be&s;ides a large Edition printed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they have lately been tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed in the <HI>German</HI> Language, by Order of the Reverend Dr. FRANCK, the pre|&s;ent worthy Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity in the Univer|&s;ity of <HI>Hall</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI> The Reverend Dr. WATTS, who corre&s;ponds with that Profe&s;&s;or, &s;ent him the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es the la&s;t Year; with which he was &s;o well plea&s;ed, as not only to give them a very high Encomium in his next Letter to the Doctor, but to get them tran&s;lated into

<HI>High-Dutch,</HI> and in&s;erted in a Collection of Pa|pers, which is publi&s;hed in that Country about once a Month, for the Advancement of Religion. In return for this Pre&s;ent, which proved &s;o very acceptable to the good Profe&s;&s;or, he &s;oon after &s;ent the Doctor a <HI>Latin</HI> Tran&s;lation of a Letter, which his excellent Father, and Predece&s;&s;or in the Divinity Chair at <HI>Hall,</HI> had publi&s;hed in the <HI>German</HI> Language, pretty much on the &s;ame Sub|ject; which the Doctor has been &s;o kind as to communicate to me, and which I have tran&s;lated into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and here added to the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es of my Brother's; in hopes that, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, it may be a con&s;iderable Means of fur|thering the good De&s;ign of them, <HI>viz.</HI> to form skilful Labourers for the Lord's Vineyard, and to revive that too much neglected Strain and Way of preaching, which large Experience has abun|dantly proved to be mo&s;t u&s;eful and &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The two proceeding Di&s;cour&s;es were originally prepared for Academical Lectures, and were de|livered by the Author to a Set of Pupils, who were training up under his In&s;truction for the Service of the Sanctuary. In the Letter, which is now added, we have the Sentiments of one of the mo&s;t celebrated Preachers and Divines, and perhaps one of the mo&s;t truly Apo&s;tolick Men, that &s;ome pa&s;t Ages have known, on the &s;ame Subject: A Man whom God did very uncom|monly own, not only as a Preacher and a Tutor, but above all in that almo&s;t miraculous Work (if I need &s;ay <HI>almo&s;t</HI>) his building and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Orphan-Hou&s;e at <HI>Glaucha</HI> in the Suburbs of <HI>Hall;</HI> a Work which both in the Beginning and Pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="004534_0055_100D63D64B545C30">
of it can be attributed to no Means &s;o pro|perly as to the Power of Faith. A Hi&s;torical Ac|count of that Affair, wrote by the Profe&s;&s;or him|&s;elf, as it was laid before <HI>Frederick I.</HI> King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to who&s;e Dominions <HI>Hall</HI> belonged, and who in the Year 1700 gave a Commi&s;&s;ion to four of his Privy Coun&s;ellors to examine &s;trictly into it, was afterwards publi&s;hed, under the Title of <HI>Pietas Hallen&s;is,</HI> and has &s;ince been tran&s;lated in|to <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be unacceptable, to &s;uch Per&s;ons e&s;pecially as have not read that larger Account, to give a brief Ab&s;tract of it in this Place.</P>
<P>When the Profe&s;&s;or was fir&s;t &s;ettled as a Mini|&s;ter at <HI>Glaucha,</HI> he, according to the Cu&s;tom of charitably di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Parts, appoin|ted one Day in every Week for the Poor to come to his Door for Alms. Their Mi&s;eries, but e&s;pe|cially the gro&s;s Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s which generally prevails among that &s;ort of People, very &s;en&s;ibly touch'd him; and above all to &s;ee Num|bers of Children among them growing up in that di&s;&s;olute Way of Life, was to him a very affec|ting and pitiful Sight. This made him re&s;olve on &s;ome Attempt for their &s;piritual as well as their bodily Relief. Accordingly every <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> which was his Day for di&s;tributing Alms, he took all the Poor that came, into his Hou&s;e; and there, be&s;ides giving them Money, he in&s;tructed the Children, in the Pre&s;ence of the Elder Per&s;ons, in the Principles of Religion, and concluded with Prayer. This Exerci&s;e was &s;et up in the begin|ning of the Year 1694. The Number of the Poor who came to this Exerci&s;e (many of them
<PB N="60" REF="004534_0056_100D63D7CFA04650">
probably for the &s;ake of the Alms) &s;oon increa&s;ing, and con&s;equently the Charge that attended it in|crea&s;ing too, obliged the Profe&s;&s;or to &s;eek for &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance in carrying on this good Work. For that Purpo&s;e therefore he &s;et up an Alms-Box in his Parlour, with the&s;e Words written over it, 1 John iii. 17. <HI>Who&s;o hath this World's Goods, and &s;eeth his Brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God is him?</HI> and under it, 2 Cor. ix. 7. <HI>Every Man according as he purpo&s;eth in his Heart, &s;o let him give, not grudgingly, or of nece&s;&s;ity, for God loveth a chearful Giver.</HI> This was intended aS a tacit Admonition to all that came in, to open their Hearts towards the Poor. About a quarter of a Year after this Box was &s;et up, a certain Per|&s;on put into it at one time, to the value of <HI>Eigh|teen Shillings and Six Pence Engli&s;h.</HI> When the Profe&s;&s;or took this Sum into his Hands, he &s;aid, in full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, <Q>This is now a con&s;i|derable Fund, worthy to be laid out in &s;ome important Undertaking; therefore I will even take this for the Foundation of a Charity-School.</Q> And immediately he laid out eight Shillings of it in Books, and hired a poor Student to teach the Children two Hours in a Day. When his Stock was ju&s;t &s;pent, &s;ome Friends who came to vi&s;it the Profe&s;&s;or, and were much plea&s;ed with his charitable E&s;&s;ay, contributed more; upon which the two Hours teaching were enlarged to five, and Alms were di&s;tributed to the Children three times a Week, to engage them to come more con&s;tantly to School. But after Matters had gone on in this Way for &s;ome time, this Profe&s;&s;or but too plainly &s;aw that all his Endeavours upon tho&s;e

poor Vagrants were like to be fru&s;trated, by their keeping &s;uch bad Company out of School-time. Some of them ran away with their Books, and re|turned to School no more. This made him re|&s;olve to choo&s;e out twelve of the mo&s;t hopeful of the Children, and to venture upon their Main|tenance, as well as their Education. At fir&s;t he put them out to Per&s;ons of known Integrity and Piety, to be educated by them. But as this little Beginning came to be known abroad, &s;everal Per|&s;ons &s;ent in Contributions to carry on &s;o good a De&s;ign; particularly the Lord put it into the Heart of a Per&s;on of Quality to give a <HI>Thou&s;and Crowns,</HI> and two other Per&s;ons contributed <HI>Four Hundred.</HI> Upon which a Hou&s;e was purcha&s;ed, and converted into an Ho&s;pital for the poor Or|phans. This was in the Year 1696. Afterwards Alms were &s;ent in by &s;everal other Per&s;ons; ma|ny of them came from unknown Hands Accor|dingly more Children were &s;till admitted into the Ho&s;pital, till the Hou&s;e grew too &s;trait for them; which put the Profe&s;&s;or on a De&s;ign of building a large and commodious Ho&s;pital; for he clearly fore&s;aw, that the hiring of more Hou&s;es, &s;cattered up and down, would be attended with very great Inconveniences. One Gentleman had lately &s;ent him <HI>five hundred Crowns,</HI> with a De&s;ire that &s;ome part of that Sum might be di&s;po&s;ed of to poor Stu|dents; which the Profe&s;&s;or looked upon as a Call of Providence, to make indigent Scholars a part of his Care. This enlarged his charitable De&s;ign beyond his former Intention. He now wanted a Building that would hold at lea&s;t two hundred Per&s;ons; but his Stock of Money was by this time &s;o far &s;pent, that, as he writes, he had not enough
<PB N="62" REF="004534_0058_100D63DAF3B6A9A8">
to build a &s;mall Cottage. No wonder then that &s;everal of his Friends di&s;&s;waded him from &s;o ha|zardous an Undertaking! But the Lord &s;trength|ened his Faith in &s;o powerful a Manner, and &s;up|ported him with &s;uch a Pre&s;ence of Mind, as car|ried him above all Di&s;couragement. Accordingly <HI>July</HI> 13. 1698. the Foundation of a &s;pacious Ho&s;|pital was laid, in THE NAME OF GOD, without any &s;ettled Fund, or &s;o much as a Promi&s;e from any great Per&s;ons to contribute to the building of it. <Q>And now, the Profe&s;&s;or writes, I was to wait upon God, and from Week to Week to receive at his Hand what he would be graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to furni&s;h me with for carrying on the Building.</Q> It mu&s;t al&s;o be remembered, that the weekly Expence of maintaining the Poor, which he had already under his Care, was very con&s;iderable; but nothing could di&s;courage the pious Profe&s;&s;or, his Faith kept Pace with his grow|ing Charity, and he had a firm Tru&s;t in Provi|dence for the fulfilling tho&s;e kind De&s;ires, which he was confidently per&s;waded God had put into his Heart. Nor were his Expectations in this Matter at all di&s;appointed; for the Building was carried on &s;ucce&s;sfully, and the Poor &s;upported all the time merely by &s;eemingly accidental Contribu|tions, which were &s;ent in from time to time by charitable Per&s;ons, living not only in <HI>Germany,</HI> but in mo&s;t other Prote&s;tant Countries in <HI>Europe.</HI> So that in the Year 1702 the Ho&s;pital was fini|&s;hed, which had co&s;t <HI>five thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and was peopled with above two hundred Poor. The Steps of Providence in carrying on this Affair were indeed very extraordinary. God &s;everal Times &s;uffered the good Profe&s;&s;or's Faith to be
<PB N="63" REF="004534_0059_100D63DD4ABE1388">
tried by very pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ities; as when the Workmen were to be paid, the Poor to be main|tained, and yet the Stock of Money was quite exhau&s;ted, and there was no rational Pro&s;pect of any further Supply. This often happened, but his Recour&s;e was always to God by Prayer, which as con&s;tantly met with a gracious An&s;wer. I will here &s;et down two or three Pa&s;&s;ages of this &s;ort, by way of In&s;tance, out of a great Number that are recorded in the <HI>Pietas Hallen&s;is</HI> Memorable In&s;tances of the Power of Faith and Prayer!</P>
<Q><P>At one time, he writes, all Provi&s;ions were gone, when the Steward declared there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of buying &s;ome Cattle to furni&s;h the Table, and other Nece&s;&s;aries. Under the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances I found one Comfort, which was a <HI>Pre&s;ence of Mind in Prayer,</HI> joined with a confident Dependance upon the Lord, who heareth the very Cry of the young Ra|vens. When Prayer was over, I heard &s;ome|body knock at the Door, which when opened there was an Acquaintance of mine holding in his Hand a Letter, and a Parcel or Money wrapt up, which he pre&s;ented to me, and I found therein <HI>fifty Crowns,</HI> &s;ent a great Way for the Relief of our Poor.</P>
<P>At another time, there was Want again in every Corner. The Steward brought me his Book and de&s;ired me to defray the Weekly Charges&punc; My Recour&s;e was to God through Faith. The Expences were nece&s;&s;ary, and I &s;aw not the lea&s;t Provi&s;ion, nor any way to pro|cure it. This made me re&s;olve to retire into
<PB N="64" REF="004534_0060_100D63E0E59DF970">
my Clo&s;et, and to beg the Lord's A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a Nece&s;&s;ity; but as I was preparing for Prayer, I received a Letter from a Mer|chant, intimating that he was ordered to pay a <HI>thou&s;and Crowns</HI> to me for the Relief of the Ho&s;pital. This put me in mind of that Saying, I&s;ai. lxv. 24. <HI>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that before they call, I will an&s;wer; and while they are yet &s;peaking, I will hear.</HI> Neverthele&s;s I entred into my Clo&s;et, but in&s;tead of begging and praying, as I had de&s;igned, I prai&s;ed and extol|led the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>Another time, I &s;tood in need of a great Sum of Money, in&s;omuch that an 100 <HI>Crowns</HI> would not have &s;erved my turn, and yet I &s;aw not the lea&s;t appearance how I might be &s;upplied with an hundred Groats. The Steward came and &s;et forth the Want we were in. I bid him to come again after Dinner, and I re&s;olved to put up my Prayers to the Lord for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. When he came again after Dinner, I was &s;till in the &s;ame Want, and &s;o appointed him to come again in the Evening. In the mean time a Friend of mine came to &s;ee me, and with him I joined in Prayers, and found my &s;elf much moved to prai&s;e and magnify the Lord for all his admirable Dealings towards Mankind, even from the beginning of the World; and the mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tances came readily to my Remembrance whil&s;t I was praying. I was &s;o elevated in prai&s;ing and magnifying God, that I in&s;i&s;ted only on that Exerci&s;e of my pre&s;ent Devotions, and found no Inclination to put up many anxious Petitions to be delivered out of
<PB N="65" REF="004534_0061_100D63E296166F28">
the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity. At length my Friend taking his leave, I accompanied him to the Door, where I found the Steward waiting on one Side for the Money he wanted, and on the other, a Per&s;on who brought an <HI>Hundred and fifty Crowns</HI> for the Support of the Ho&s;pital.</P></Q>
<P>Thus was this famous Ho&s;pital, which has &s;ince been one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Ornaments and Supports of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany,</HI> built without any other Fund but that of Faith. Surely, we mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</HI> Whether it may pa&s;s for a Miracle or no, yet thus much I take for certain, that if any Popi&s;h Mona&s;tery had ever been founded in the &s;ame Manner, and &s;uch remark|able Steps of Providence had attended the Build|ing of it, as did actually attend this Prote&s;tant Ho&s;pital at <HI>Hall,</HI> the World would have rung with the Noi&s;e of the Miracle, and it had indeed been a much better Miracle than any which the Papi&s;ts boa&s;t of. But to return to the Story. The Ho&s;pital being thus fini&s;hed, at lea&s;t as far as was intended when the Foundation was laid, it was &s;till to depend immediately on Providence for its future Support and Maintenance Nor for this did the Profe&s;&s;or's Faith fail, nor were his Hopes di&s;appointed; for the Author of the Preface to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation of Profe&s;&s;or FRANCK's <HI>Chri&s;tus &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">crae Scripturae Nucleus,</HI> informs us, that in the Year 1706 the State of the Ho&s;pital was as follows.</P>
<P>Ten Schools, in which 988 Children were in|&s;tructed by 72 Ma&s;ters. The Number of Per&s;ons
<PB N="66" REF="004534_0062_100D63E41D118F10">
lodged and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Ho&s;pital was 360, and 84 poor Students of the Univer&s;ity had their Diet there. Eight poor Widows were maintained, with a Chaplain and a Maid Servant, and Provi&s;ion al&s;o was made for the Relief of ca&s;ual Poor</P>
<P>The Death of this excellent Profe&s;&s;or, which happened in the Year 1727, in the 65th Year of his Age, filled many Per&s;ons with Fear, that this good Work of Charity, now it mu&s;t be deprived of the Support of his Influence and Prayers, would langui&s;h and die too, but in this their Fears have been happily di&s;appointed. It was Honour e|nough for this holy Man to be &s;uch an illu&s;trious In&s;tance of Faith, and to be the In&s;trument of &s;o great and good a Work: But the Lord has &s;ince made it appear that the Work was his, and that the Re&s;idue of the Spirit is with him. For I find in the before-cited Preface, that at the Conclu&s;ion of the Year 1731, which was four Years after Dr. FRANCK's Death, the number of the Scholars and Children in the &s;everal Schools of the Or|phan-Hou&s;e amounted to 2300, and the number of Students who in&s;tructed them to 160. I am further informed by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Zeigen|hagen,</HI> the pre&s;ent worthy Pa&s;tor of the <HI>German</HI> Church at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, that the Ho&s;pital &s;till con|tinues in a very flouri&s;hing State, and that &s;ome further Additions were made to the Buildings, but about three Years ago.</P>
<P>Many u&s;eful In&s;tructions might be deducted from this Narrative. What Arguments for a Providence, what Encouragement to Prayer, what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to Work of Charity, might it yield us?
<PB N="67" REF="004534_0063_100D63E65036AE38">
But I have already &s;welled this Preface almo&s;t be|yond all rea&s;onable Bounds, and therefore mu&s;t not in&s;i&s;t here on the&s;e Topicks.</P>
<P>I have only to ob&s;erve further, that the Letter which follows was written by this great and good Man about two Years before his Death, in which we have his Opinion and Judgment, ripen'd by Age and large Experience, concerning <HI>the mo&s;t u&s;eful Way of Preaching.</HI> And what Mini&s;ter, who is in good Earne&s;t concerned to approve him|&s;elf faithful in his Work, to advance the Honour of Chri&s;t, and do good to Souls, would not be glad to con&s;ult &s;o great and experienced a Ma&s;ter? And who would not pay &s;ome con&s;iderable Defe|rence to the Judgment of &s;uch an Apo&s;tolick Man, a Man &s;o highly honoured of God, as Pro|fe&s;&s;or FRANCK was?</P>
<P>The good Profe&s;&s;or him&s;elf had, it &s;eems, &s;uch an Opinion of this little Piece, as to de&s;ire it might be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity. He therefore in&s;ert|ed it entire in a Preface to a Quarto Volume of Sermons which he publi&s;hed in the Year 1726, on purpo&s;e, as he there declares, that it might not be lo&s;t, as &s;ingle Sheets are apt to be; but that Po&s;terity might know his Thoughts upon this Matter And after the End of it, he declares in a very &s;olemn Manner, <HI>as in the Pre&s;ence of the Lord,</HI> that what he had thus written was the Re|&s;ult of his own Experience; and that the&s;e Rules and Directions which he had given to other Mi|ni&s;ters, were the &s;ame that he had con&s;tantly fol|lowed and practiced upon in the whole Cour&s;e of his own Preaching and Mini&s;try.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER To a FRIEND Concerning the mo&s;t u&s;eful WAY of <HI>PREACHING.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured and dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion which you have propo&s;ed to me, <HI>viz. How a faithful Mini&s;ter, who earne&s;tly de&s;ires to &s;ave and to edify the Souls of his Hearers, to gain Sinners unto Chri&s;t, and to inflame their Hearts with a growing Love to their Saviour, may be&s;t adapt his Preaching to the&s;e excellent Purpo&s;es?</HI> I can only at pre&s;ent &s;ugge&s;t a few things briefly; whereas if I had more Lei&s;ure, I &s;hould choo&s;e to write more copiou&s;ly on &s;o weighty a Subject.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="70" REF="004534_0066_100D63EDCE3E9B40">I. I mu&s;t take it for granted that a Mini&s;ter, who &s;incerely de&s;ires and who is likely to do good by his Preaching, is &s;uch a one, both in Heart &amp; in Life, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;cribes, 2 Tim. i. 13, 14. <HI>Who holds fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words</HI> (or the pure Apo&s;tolic Doctrine) <HI>which he has heard, in faith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and <HI>who keeps that good thing which has been committed to him by the Holy Gho&s;t which dwelleth in him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It will not a little &s;ub&s;erve the good Ends propo&s;ed in the Que&s;tion, for a Mini&s;ter, very frequently, to lay down in his Sermons the di|&s;tingui&s;hing Marks and Characters both of the Converted and of the Unconverted, and that with all po&s;&s;ible Plainne&s;s, that &s;o every one of his Hearers may be able to judge of his own State, and may know to which of the&s;e two Cla&s;&s;es he belongs. But then great Care mu&s;t be taken that tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters are ju&s;tly drawn: For it may ea&s;ily happen, thro' a Preacher's Un|skilfulne&s;s in this Affair, that the Unconverted, on the one hand, may be deceived into a good Opinion of their pre&s;ent State, and may grow thereupon more &s;ecure and carele&s;s; and that &s;ome converted Per&s;ons, on the other hand, may be unrea&s;onably di&s;quieted and filled with ground|le&s;s and fruitle&s;s Fears. However, a prudent Mini&s;ter, who has experienced a Work of Grace upon his own Heart, will have no great Difficul|ty &s;o to de&s;cribe it to others, as &s;ufficiently to guard again&s;t the Mi&s;takes on both &s;ides; and to lead both one and the other, by the unerring Light of Scripture, into the Knowledge of the true State of their own Souls.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="71" REF="004534_0067_100D63F0C1BDDCA0">III. For this Purpo&s;e al&s;o let a Mini&s;ter care|fully and clearly di&s;tingui&s;h in his Preaching, be|twixt mere Morality and true Religion; betwixt the moral hone&s;t Man and the &s;ound Believer, who, from a deep Conviction of the Depravity of his Nature and the Errors of his Life, has learn'd to hate Sin from his Heart, and lives by the Faith of the Son of God. For it is hardly credible what Multitudes of Per&s;ons there are, even in Chri&s;tian Countries, where the Go&s;pel is publickly and faithfully preached, who, though they are wi&s;e enough in other Matters, yet in this are they gro&s;ly ignorant, and thereby mi&s;erably deceive their own Souls.</P>
<P N="4">IV. And, becau&s;e this kind of Self-Deceit is &s;o very common, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary for a Mini|&s;ter to in&s;truct his Hearers with all po&s;&s;ible Plain|ne&s;s, in the Duty of Self-examination; and very often to exhort them to it: As more e&s;pecially to enquire, If ever they were awakened from their natural Sleep in Sin? If they have e&s;caped out of the Snare of the Devil? If ever they have had a lively and affecting Sen&s;e of the Corruption of their own Hearts, and of the Mi&s;ery of their natural State? And, in &s;hort, whether they have good and &s;olid Rea&s;ons to conclude that they are regenerate Per&s;ons? Whether they can find in them&s;elves the genuine Marks of a true Conver|&s;ion to God, and a living Faith in Chri&s;t? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or whether, on the other hand, they do not con|clude that they are true Chri&s;tians and in a State of Salvation, merely from their being moral ho|ne&s;t Men, and their not living in any gro&s;s and &s;candalous Sin? And, perhaps too, from their &s;ay|ing
<PB N="72" REF="004534_0068_100D63F246CFAAE8">
Prayers, hearing Sermons, and frequenting the Places of public Wor&s;hip, and from their practi&s;ing &s;uch like outward Duties of Religion? Or again, whether they do not flatter them&s;elves that their eternal State is &s;afe, merely becau&s;e their Lives are not altogether &s;o bad as the Lives of &s;ome others?</P>
<P N="5">V. It would al&s;o be of very con&s;iderable u&s;e for a Mini&s;ter often to explain, and to &s;hew the Difference betwixt a Legal and an Evangelical Frame and Principle of Religion; or betwixt that &s;lavi&s;h Fear, by which alone it is that &s;ome Per|&s;ons, even of a &s;erious Turn of Mind, are forced and dragg'd as it were to their Duty, and that E|vangelical Newne&s;s of Spirit, that filial Love to God and Delight in his Service, which u&s;ually grows and flouri&s;hes in the Soul where it is once planted, and which produces a free, uncon&s;train|ed and acceptable Religion. This would be an excellent Means, not only of awakening Sinners out of their carnal Security, but of turning them throughly unto God, to a holy Walk and to a plea&s;urable Conver&s;e with him, even &s;uch as be|comes his Children. And for this End it is of very great Moment, that a Mini&s;ter not only in&s;truct his Hearers what they mu&s;t do, and how they ought to act, but that he al&s;o labour fully to ap|pri&s;e and to convince them, by the Evidence of Scripture, of their own native Weakne&s;s and Impotency for all that is &s;piritually good; and that he further &s;hew them, by the &s;ame Word of Truth, from whence they mu&s;t look for, and from whom they may hope to receive, all Grace and Strength, not only to renew their Souls in
<PB N="73" REF="004534_0069_100D63F3C978D9B8">
their fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, but al&s;o afterwards to ena|ble them to perform every Duty, as well of out|ward as of inward Religion. They mu&s;t be told that they can do nothing without Chri&s;t, accord|ing as he has a&s;&s;ured us, John xv. 5. <HI>Without me ye can do nothing.</HI> And again, that by the Help of his Grace they may do all things, according as St. <HI>Paul</HI> writes, Phil. iv. 13. <HI>I can do all things thro' Chri&s;t &s;trengthning me.</HI> Thus &s;hould Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters con&s;tantly make it the Aim and Drift of their Preaching, to lead their Hearers to Chri&s;t, and to his Grace; to Him by <HI>who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed,</HI> and who&s;e Blood takes away all the Sins of all that truly repent &amp; believe, &amp; by who&s;e <HI>divine power all things are given to us that pertain to life and godline&s;s,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 3. Thus the Holy Apo&s;tles preached; the&s;e were the Topicks which they in&s;i&s;ted much upon; and if their Example is not followed in this matter, it will be no wonder if our modern Preaching comes va&s;tly &s;hort of the Succe&s;s of theirs: And by this means &s;ome of our Hearers will be in danger of &s;inking into a mere Legal Frame and Spirit of Bondage, while they are pre&s;s'd to Duty and Working, but not en|couraged by the Grace of Chri&s;t, nor directed where to look for Strength to perform it; and others of them will take up with a fal&s;e Peace, a carnal Security, for want of being directed to Chri&s;t, who is the only Foundation of the Sin|ner's rea&s;onable Hope and &s;olid Comfort. But on the other hand, when both the&s;e Points are well explain'd and duly in&s;i&s;ted on, no other Means are &s;o powerful to awaken &s;ecure Sinners, to bring them to Chri&s;t, and to &s;ettle their Souls in &s;olid
<PB N="74" REF="004534_0070_100D63F60DA247B8">
Peace and Comfort. Hereby, under the Influ|ence of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, they find them&s;elves tran&s;ported as it were into a new Life; and now they go on with Vigour and Plea&s;ure in the Prac|tice of univer&s;al Piety.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It would further be u&s;eful, and it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that Mini&s;ters &s;hould not only preach up the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion, and in&s;truct their Hearers to depend on the Grace of Chri&s;t for it, but al&s;o that they &s;hould, very frequently, in their Sermons explain the Nature and the whole Pro|gre&s;s of Conver&s;ion, &s;ometimes more largely and di&s;tinctly, and at other times more briefly, en|deavouring thereby to lead their Hearers into a true Knowledge of the State of their Souls; and &s;hewing them how they mu&s;t repent of their Sins, what they mu&s;t do to be &s;aved from their natural Mi&s;ery and Ruin, and, in &s;hort, how they may obtain the full Salvation of the Go&s;pel; that &s;o every one may be able to give an An&s;wer to that mo&s;t important Que&s;tion, <HI>What mu&s;t I do that I may be a Child of God and inherit eternal Life?</HI> For let a Mini&s;ter entertain his Hearers with the &s;ublime&s;t Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, let him al&s;o declaim again&s;t Sin and exhort them to their various Duties in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and pathe|tick manner, and let all be adorned with the fi|ne&s;t Beauties of Wit and Eloquence; yet, after all, if his Sermons are not &s;o contrived and fram|ed as, at the &s;ame time, to inform the Ignorant how they may obtain an Intere&s;t in the Go&s;pel-Salvation for them&s;elves, and what Means and Methods God has appointed for that Purpo&s;e; what will it profit them? No more than a parcel
<PB N="75" REF="004534_0071_100D63F845F6D330">
of Shreds of Cloths, of various Dyes, tho' they were of the fine&s;t Thread and livelie&s;t Colours, would &s;erve the Purpo&s;e of a Man who wants a hand&s;ome Garment; whereas a Sermon that informs the ignorant Sinner, not only of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Conver&s;ion, but al&s;o how that happy Change may certainly be effected in his own Soul, may not unfitly be compared, in re&s;pect to its U&s;efulne&s;s, to a complete Garment, made all of a Piece, well fitted to the Man's Shape that wants it, and which he may therefore put on and wear with Honour and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But now in order to all this, a Mini&s;ter mu&s;t take Pains with his own Heart, as well as in com|po&s;ing his Sermons; he mu&s;t have a Zeal for Chri&s;t, and mu&s;t aim at nothing &s;o much as to bring Sinners to him&punc; This &s;hould be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the De&s;ign and Drift of every Sermon that he preaches, that &s;o if a Per&s;on &s;hould hap|pen to hear him but once in all his Life, he might, even by means of that one Sermon, get &s;ome No|tion of the one thing needful, and be ju&s;t enter'd at lea&s;t into the Way of Salvation. For this &s;hould every Mini&s;ter &s;tudy and &s;trive, and for this &s;hould he continually pray that God would fill his Heart with pious Zeal and holy Wi&s;dom, that &s;o he may divide the Word of Truth aright, and admini&s;ter Grace unto Hearers.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It might probably make &s;ome good Im|pre&s;&s;ions on the Minds of the People, was a Mi|ni&s;ter pretty often to inculcate, with great Plain|ne&s;s and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Prayer; and more particularly what need they have to pray
<PB N="76" REF="004534_0072_100D63FA805B2020">
very earne&s;tly to the God of all Grace that he would &s;et home his Word upon their Hearts, that he would bring the good Seed to Perfection in their full and ble&s;&s;ed Conformity to him&s;elf. And further, &s;o great is the Ignorance of many Per|&s;ons concerning the Duty of Prayer, that they &s;eem to have no other Notion of it than merely a reading &s;ome Forms out of a Prayer-Book. This makes it to be as nece&s;&s;ary, as it would pro|bably be a u&s;eful thing, for a Mini&s;ter to lead them, as it were by the Hand, into this Path of their Duty; that is, to explain it to them in a mo&s;t ea&s;y and familiar manner, to &s;hew them that it requires no great Art and Skill to pray acceptably unto God; for they are to &s;peak to him as Children to a loving Father, they are to &s;pread before him their Sorrows and Complaints, they are to tell him of the State and Condition of their Souls, ju&s;t as they find and feel it; and they need not be at all &s;ollicitous about Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion and elegant Phra&s;es in their &s;ecret Prayers; for God regards the Sen&s;e of the Heart, rather than the Language of the Lips. The Scriptures them|&s;elves furni&s;h us with &s;everal Examples of &s;uch artle&s;s and yet acceptable Prayers. Let a Mini|&s;ter then diligently in&s;truct his Hearers how they are, in the fir&s;t Place, to get their Hearts di&s;po|&s;ed for Prayer; and it may be of u&s;e too to a&s;&s;i&s;t and furni&s;h the more ignorant with Words and &s;it Expre&s;&s;ions; but at the &s;ame time let him in|form them that they need not tie them&s;elves to u&s;e tho&s;e very Words, nor any Form whatever; but that they &s;hould learn to pour out their Hearts unto God, in &s;uch Words by which they can be&s;t expre&s;s the real Sentiments and Affections of their
<PB N="77" REF="004534_0073_100D63FC07D24DD8">
own Souls, according to the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. lxii. 8. <HI>Ye people, pour out your hearts before him.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. It is further extreamly nece&s;&s;ary that Mini&s;ters &s;hould very often take Occa&s;ion to ex|plain in their Sermons that Renewing or Change of the Mind, which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to all true Reli|gion, and which yet, alas! but very few Per&s;ons &s;eem to under&s;tand, or indeed to have almo&s;t any Notion of. Nor is it enough to explain that fir&s;t and mighty Change, which is at once made in a Sinner at his Conver&s;ion, when he comes to love that Good which before he hated, and to hate that Evil which he before loved, when from being an Unbeliever he becomes a Believer; or when his fal&s;e and dead Faith is changed into a true and &s;aving one: But that further progre&s;&s;ive Change &s;hould al&s;o be much recommended, in which the Chri&s;tian mu&s;t be improving to the very End of his Life, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> refers to, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 18. <HI>But now</HI> (the Veil which was upon the Heart being taken away, and the Spirit of the Lord ha|ving taken up his dwelling in it, Ver&s;es 16, 17.) <HI>we all with open face beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Hereby the Mind is more and more renewed, the Chri&s;tian grows up in the Spirit and Temper of Chri&s;t, and his lovely Image is drawn upon the Soul in fairer Lines every Day than other.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is of con&s;iderable Moment al&s;o that the whole Faith and Duty of a Chri&s;tian be repre&s;ent|ed in its mo&s;t amiable and attractive Light, that &s;o Sinners may be won to Religion upon a full
<PB N="78" REF="004534_0074_100D63FFCD233C48">
Conviction, that if they would do well for them|&s;elves and obtain true Peace and Comfort, the &s;horte&s;t, the &s;ure&s;t, and indeed the only Way is to turn in good earne&s;t from Sin to God and Ho|line&s;s; and that Religion is by no means a grie|vous and melancholy thing, which any need be afraid of, but full of Plea&s;ure and greatly de|&s;ireable even for its own Sake; and tho' it calls us indeed to a pre&s;ent Combat, and requires us to &s;ight and &s;trive again&s;t Sin; yet this is but in or|der to Peace and to a certain Victory, which will much more than recompence the Toils of the War.</P>
<P N="10">X. It were much to be wi&s;hed that Mini&s;ters would not take up more of their Sermons than needs mu&s;t in explaining their Text, but rather, after as &s;hort an Explication of it as is &s;ufficient to lead their Hearers into the true Sen&s;e and Mean|ing, (which mu&s;t by no means be neglected) ha|&s;ten to the Application; and in that, let a Mini|&s;ter addre&s;s him&s;elf to his Hearers with a becom|ing Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Earne&s;tne&s;s; let him apply his Subject both to Saints and Sinners, to the Con|verted and to the Unconverted, in order to a|waken the Secure and Carele&s;s, and to build up true Believers in their Faith and Holine&s;s. Ex|perience would &s;oon &s;hew that this is by far the more profitable Way, than to &s;pend almo&s;t the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, as &s;ome do, in explaining their Text and Subject, and then clo&s;e with a very &s;hort Application, becau&s;e the Time is gone.</P>
<P N="11">XI. It were al&s;o greatly to be wi&s;hed, that tho&s;e Under-Shepherds of the Flock of Chri&s;t would
<PB N="79" REF="004534_0075_100D6401FA75ED58">
make it more de&s;ignedly and zealou&s;ly the Pur|po&s;e of their Preaching to bring Sinners to him, who is the great Shepherd of the Sheep; that they would &s;trive by the mo&s;t winning Argu|ments they can po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e, and e&s;pecially by &s;uch as the Grace of the Go&s;pel will naturally &s;ugge&s;t, to per&s;wade and even to compel them to come to him. As the Hen when &s;he lights on a few Crumbs or Grains of Corn, how earne&s;tly does &s;he invite her Brood to come and &s;hare the Trea&s;ure with her! She will by no means be &s;a|ti&s;fied nor leave off calling them till they come. Thus did our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; how graciou&s;ly did he call and invite Sinners to come to him in the Days of his per&s;onal Mini&s;try upon Earth! As Matt. xi. 28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. A|gain John vii. 37, 38. <HI>If any man thir&s;t, let him come to me and drink: He that believeth on me, as the &s;cripture &s;aith, out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living water.</HI> And much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e we find him &s;peaking in &s;everal other Places. Thus al&s;o we hear the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, inviting Sinners unto Chri&s;t, I&s;ai. lv. 1. <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the wa|ters,</HI> &amp;c. and thus St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the New Te&s;ta|ment, 2 Cor. v. 11. <HI>We be&s;eech you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI> And thus doth the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> over and over in his divine Wri|tings. Remarkable to this Purpo&s;e al&s;o are tho&s;e Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour concerning <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> Matt. xxiii. 37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy children even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing!</HI> Chri&s;t called Sinners to come to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as their proper Lord and Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="80" REF="004534_0076_100D640431C19068">
as their only Redeemer and Saviour; whereas <HI>we,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul, preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 5. and therefore we endeavour to bring Sinners not to our&s;elves, but to Him. But now in order to this, and that a Mini&s;ter may be thus happily &s;ucce&s;sful in his Preaching, he mu&s;t not only &s;incerely love his People and have an affectionate Concern for their Salvation, but he mu&s;t be an ardent Lover of Chri&s;t too; he mu&s;t wi&s;h and de&s;ire and covet nothing &s;o much as to bring all that hear him to Chri&s;t, to deliver every one of them, as it were, into his gracious Arms, could he but per&s;wade them to be &s;o happy; that thus they may learn, even by the Example of their Mini&s;ter, to love the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="12">XII. For this purpo&s;e it is farther requi&s;ite that a Mini&s;ter &s;hould very often take Occa&s;ion to di&s;|play, in the mo&s;t lively Colours that he can, the Excellency and Glory of Chri&s;t's Per&s;on, the Kindne&s;s of his Heart and the exceeding Riches of his Grace both as he is God and Man, as he is now a glorious triumphant Saviour, as well as once he &s;u&s;tained &amp; executed the &s;ame Office in a hum|bled &amp; &s;uffering State. And that he further inform his Hearers what excellent Ble&s;&s;ings are trea&s;ured up in Chri&s;t to be be&s;towed on all his Friends and People, that &s;o they may be drawn to him by a Principle of De&s;ire and Love, that they may mo&s;t willingly give him their Hearts; and that &s;o it may be the Breathing of their Souls and the Matter of their mo&s;t earne&s;t Prayer to Chri&s;t, that he would be plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his Love to them, that he would <HI>&s;hed it abroad in their heart by his
<PB N="81" REF="004534_0077_100D6405B55D06A8">
holy Spirit,</HI> Rom. v. 5, that he would more and more reveal to them the Glory of his Maje&s;ty, that he would impre&s;s and affect their Minds with a lively Sen&s;e of it, that &s;o they may yet more and more love and honour him their heavenly Spou&s;e, by whom it is that they have, and that they farther hope for Acce&s;s to and Acceptance with the Father, and with whom they al&s;o hope to dwell for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Love of Chri&s;t ought to be much more in&s;i&s;ted on by Preachers than what is com|monly done; becau&s;e when we apply to our&s;elves in a right Manner, his Pa&s;&s;ion, Death and Atone|ment, his Merits, and that Purcha&s;e of Salvation which he hath made for us, the Knowledge of his Love to us, and of our Pardon and Ju&s;tification thro' Faith in his Blood, it is the true&s;t Spring and mo&s;t powerful Attractive of our Love to him. Now the more we love Chri&s;t, and that for this very Rea&s;on, <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us,</HI> the better will every other Branch of our Religion flouri&s;h, every other Grace and every Duty will then flow from its proper Fountain; and therefore the more a Mini&s;ter endeavours to in&s;til this Principle of &s;acred Love into the Hearts of his Hearers, the more comfortable Succe&s;s will he probably &s;ee of his Labours, in their &s;piritual Improvement and growing Obedience to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially, and in the fir&s;t Place, let every Mini&s;ter look to his own Heart; and &s;ee to it that he him&s;elf loves Chri&s;t fervently, le&s;t he &s;hould be as <HI>the &s;ounding bra&s;s and as the tinkling cymbal,</HI> which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 1.
<PB N="82" REF="004534_0078_100D64075247B7D0">
And be&s;ides, without a &s;incere Love to Chri&s;t in his own Soul, there will be little Probability of his recommending him effectually to the Love of others. It is not enough for him to preach a great many Sermons upon the Love of Chri&s;t, and to exhort his Hearers to love him; for if his own Heart is not warmed with this &s;acred Love, his Di&s;cour&s;es on that Subject will be apt to be cold and lifele&s;s, and therefore unprofitable and fruit|le&s;s. Nothing could be more pertinently an|&s;wered in a few Words, to one that asked ano|ther, How he might learn to be a good and a u&s;eful Preacher? than this, <HI>Si multum ames Chri&s;|tum,</HI> You mu&s;t learn to be a zealous Lover of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But then let it be further noted, that &s;incere Love to Chri&s;t will always expre&s;s it&s;elf not only in Words, but by &s;uitable or corre&s;pondent Ac|tions. So our Saviour has taught us, John xv. 14. <HI>Ye are my friends,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if ye do what&s;oever I command you;</HI> i. e. this is the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial Evidence of your &s;incere Friend&s;hip, and that you truly love me.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I reckon al&s;o the Duties of Self-denial and Weanedne&s;s from the World and its carnal Plea&s;ures, and, in &s;hort, from all the pre&s;ent things of Sen&s;e and Time, to be among tho&s;e more important and nece&s;&s;ary Subjects which Mini&s;ters &s;hould often preach upon, oftner indeed than mo&s;t of them do. The&s;e are Subjects which our Saviour Chri&s;t, when he was a Preacher upon Earth, very much in&s;i&s;ted upon in his Sermons, as you may &s;ee particularly Matt. xvi. 24, 25, 26.
<PB N="83" REF="004534_0079_100D64098939FBF8">
<HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him|&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s and follow me.</HI> Luke xiv. 26. <HI>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>yea and his own life al&s;o,</HI> i. e. in Compari&s;on of me, <HI>he cannot be my di&s;ci|ple.</HI> And how needful are the&s;e Subjects now? For alas! how many Per&s;ons are there, who can talk well about Chri&s;t and Religion, nay who carry a fair Appearance of Virtue and Godline&s;s, and who perform many outward Duties with Re|putation and Honour, and yet not having learn|ed to deny them&s;elves, their Love of the World not being &s;ufficiently mortified, they are ea&s;ily overcome in a Day of Trial, and &s;acrifice their Religion and their Souls to their worldly Intere&s;t. Let Self-denial then be earne&s;tly recommended, and that, not merely as a moral Virtue or philo|&s;ophical Attainment, I mean not upon &s;uch Prin|ciples only as the Heathen Morali&s;ts u&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon; but let it be recommended and urged as a Chri&s;tian Grace, as that which flows chiefly from Love to Chri&s;t, even &s;uch a Love as will make us ready to deny our&s;elves the Plea&s;ures, Riches and Honours of this World, all manner of &s;en&s;ual Gratifications, and our very Lives them&s;elves, <GAP DESC="foreign"> for his Sake, as Chri&s;t not only ex|pects but requires of us, <HI>Matt.</HI> xvi. 25.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Tho' the diligent reading of the Scrip|tures them&s;elves, even the in&s;pired Writings of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles, and the very Words of our Saviour Chri&s;t, &s;hould be chiefly recom|mended, as they are undoubtedly far preferable to any other Books of mere human Compo&s;ure; yet be&s;ides the&s;e a Mini&s;ter may very profitably
<PB N="84" REF="004534_0080_100D640BC02ED448">
recommend to his Hearers &s;ome other good Books of Religion, both ancient and modern, to be read by them at home in their own Clo&s;ets or Families: Such Books I mean as are written in a truly evan|gelical Strain, and with a Spirit of lively Devo|tion and Piety, which would be no incon&s;iderable Means, both of pre&s;erving and nouri&s;hing the Fire of divine Love in their Hearts. I might mention, by way of In&s;tance, <HI>Martin Statius's Lutherus Redivivus,</HI> which is nothing el&s;e but an Abridgment of <HI>Luther</HI>'s Works, in which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages are collected into a narrow Room, and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages more e&s;pecially, as have the mo&s;t direct and powerful Tendency to awaken and to excite the Minds of Men to lively practical Religion. However, I mention this but as one In&s;tance, out of a great many ve|ry excellent and u&s;eful Books which the Provi|dence of God has now furni&s;hed his Church with|al, and which we ought to account as a precious Trea&s;ure to it. And further, let not any Mini|&s;ter think that 'tis the People only who are to be profited in their Souls by the reading &s;uch good Books, while all the u&s;e that he is concerned to make of them for him&s;elf, is only to form his Stile by reading them, or to borrow Thoughts from them, or it may be to &s;teal Sermons out of them (which is &s;hamefully the Practice of too many Preachers) but he &s;hould read them, chiefly and in the fir&s;t Place, with a View to his own &s;piritual Edification. He &s;hould endeavour &s;o to u&s;e and improve the Gifts which God has be&s;towed on o|ther Men, as that his own Soul may be the better for them as well as the Souls of the People to whom he preaches</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="85" REF="004534_0081_100D640D47FC4408">XVI. Once more, let faithful Mini&s;ters by no means forget to recommend it to their Hearers, that they would familiarly acquaint them&s;elves and conver&s;e with &s;erious, lively, and growing Chri&s;|tians, and with &s;uch more e&s;pecially as excel in the Gift and Spirit of Prayer; for as a live Coal kindles another that is cold and dead, &s;o will the &s;avoury Di&s;cour&s;e, the fervent Prayers and the holy Conver&s;ation of warm and lively Chri&s;tians, be a probable Means of kindling the &s;ame Fire of divine Love in the Souls of dead Sinners; or at lea&s;t of nouri&s;hing &amp; improving the &s;acred Flame in the Hearts of their more intimate Chri&s;tian Friends. Mini&s;ters &s;hould therefore do all they can to promote &s;uch Chri&s;tian Conver&s;ation, a|mong&s;t the more &s;erious part of their Hearers: Ob&s;erving however the Rules of nece&s;&s;ary Pru|dence, particularly that of the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. xiv. 40. <HI>Let all things be done decently and in or|der.</HI> They &s;hould exhort them as St. <HI>Paul</HI> does the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians,</HI> Col. iii. 16. <HI>Let the word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all wi&s;dom, teaching and ad|moni&s;hing one another in p&s;alms and hymns and &s;pi|ritual &s;ongs, &s;inging with grace in your hearts unto the Lord;</HI> to which pious Purpo&s;e that large and rich Trea&s;ure of &s;acred Hymns, both ancient and modern, with which God has graciou&s;ly ble&s;&s;ed his Church, is not a little conducive, for which therefore we are bound to render him immortal Prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly an&s;wered your Que&s;tion, and given you my Thoughts on the mo&s;t u&s;eful Way of Preaching. May God, for Chri&s;t's Sake, attend what I have written with his effectual

Ble&s;&s;ing. To him I would now humbly offer up the following Prayer.</P>
<P><Q>O Lord God! give, I be&s;eech thee, both now and at all times hereafter to thy Church, Pa&s;tors and Teachers after thine own Heart, even &s;uch as &s;hall bring the Sheep of Chri&s;t into his Fold, and who, thro' the Influence of thy good Spirit, &s;hall feed them with &s;aving Knowledge and Under&s;tanding.
