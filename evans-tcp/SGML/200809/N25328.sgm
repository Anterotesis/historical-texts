<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AT a period like this, when the great ma&s;s of the people ap|pears entirely devoted to Political pur&s;uits; when ancient preju|dices, or Utopian plans, actuate the views and engro&s;s the atten|tion of all; and &s;chemes of &s;upporting or reforming our &s;y&s;tem of Government, &s;upply a thou&s;and requi&s;ites to fill up the blank &s;paces in the minds of men; but to which requi&s;ites there are &s;o many objections; a publication which &s;hould attempt a part in dive&s;ting the general pur&s;uit of &s;ubjects, &s;o petulant and inflam|matory, might neither be unnece&s;&s;ary nor unacceptable. A Chro|nicle like this, &s;eems long to have been wanting to concenter in one point of view, the &s;cenes of wickedne&s;s and criminality, of brutality and lu&s;t, of farcical ab&s;urdities, and ridiculous propen|&s;ity, which have, during the cour&s;e of later years, &s;o &s;trangely attracted the notice of the Public, and demanded the interpo&s;ition of the law: various publications have, indeed, given many de|details of the&s;e important circum&s;tances to the world, but every one in &s;uch a mode as to be liable to the greate&s;t objection. The form of Depo&s;ition, is the way in which every Trial, however unintere&s;ting, has been given; a mode which the fanciful &s;cenes of the mo&s;t amu&s;ing &s;ubject could hardly enliven, but which mu&s;t be peculiarly cold and repul&s;ive, when employed as the vehicle of facts neither extraordinary nor important. The minute&s;t occur|rences, &s;o circum&s;tantially repeated, the &s;ame ground &s;o frequently traver&s;ed, and the perpetual recurrence of the dull &s;tile of legal procedure, form objections invincible again&s;t the imperfect col|lection we at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s of Trials for the violation of the Hy|meneal vow. The large&s;t collection we have at pre&s;ent, is totally inadequate to a full comprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject, as it compri&s;es at mo&s;t only the cour&s;e of twenty years, viz. from 1760, to 1780. The inexhau&s;tible fund of intere&s;ting matter contained in the State Trials, the &s;triking occurences of various Courts of Ju|risdiction,
<PB N="iv" REF="033585_0004_0FF78F79D0CB1E38">
and the va&s;t number of Trials, &s;ince the year 1780, which exi&s;t only in a fugitive &s;tate, call loudly for a completer mode of collection, than has as yet been attempted. Our grand object will be to pre&s;ent to the Public, a &s;eries of circum&s;tances of &s;uch mingled &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and ab&s;urdity, &s;uch criminal turpitude and &s;uch ridiculous weakne&s;s, compri&s;ing &s;cenes &s;o wildly ridicu|lous, and &s;o extravagantly ab&s;urd, as mu&s;t arre&s;t every attention, and furni&s;h food for every di&s;po&s;ition; and this we &s;hall convey in the ea&s;y mode of <HI>Narrative,</HI> by which we &s;hall &s;implify the mo&s;t intricate occurrences, and obviate that complaint of dulne&s;s and langour, which has &s;o long and &s;o ju&s;tly been urged again&s;t the&s;e compo&s;itions. That neighbouring nation, which led the way to poli&s;hed grace, and ob&s;equious gallantry in modern Europe, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;cience of &s;uperior breeding, and matured the refined eloquence of Courts, introduced, with her fa&s;cinating influence, the contempt of tho&s;e ties of connubial love which are really &s;o &s;acred; and, before &s;he uttered her political metaphy&s;ics, contaminated private life by the le&s;s laboured doctrines of her ac|compli&s;hed men of fa&s;hion and courtiers. Royalty and elegance &s;eem to have yielded, in that country, to the &s;tern virtues of haughty Republicani&s;m; and England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es devotees of plea|&s;ure, &s;eemingly re&s;olved to wear the glaring laurel of profligate fame, which France has re&s;igned: You know it, (meaning the di&s;honour of your bed) &s;aid a celebrated French morali&s;t and wit, it is but a trifle, if you are ignorant of it, it is nothing. We &s;eem, in many in&s;tances, to have improved on this con&s;olatory ax|iom: to have con&s;idered the knowledge, nay, it might be nearly &s;aid, the damning &s;ight of our mo&s;t infamous di&s;honour as nothing: of this the &s;tores of novel information, we have to bring forwards will afford deci&s;ive proof, and the whole arrangement of curious matter, furni&s;hes heroines among&s;t the ladies, not unworthy of being ranked with an Errington or a Newton, though as yet want|ing their fame and characters among the Gentlemen de&s;erving of being ranked in the highe&s;t cla&s;s of &s;educers, although capricious fortune has denied them their well earned celebrity.</P>
<P>To the youthful, the gay, and the fa&s;hionable, the &s;cenes of frolic and amu&s;ement, of &s;ubterfuge and intrigue, of art and of temptation, now intended to be laid before them, will &s;upply an
<PB N="v" REF="033585_0005_0FF78F7BB0271660">
inexhau&s;tible fund of amu&s;ement, and afford a &s;pecies of relaxation, conveying more in&s;truction for the u&s;e of dome&s;tic life, than the mo&s;t au&s;tere dogma of morality can offer. To men of a &s;erious and contemplative turn, this Work will not be without its u&s;e: the le&s;&s;ons of morality we &s;hall occa&s;ionaly inter&s;per&s;e, will, in concert with their own reflections, &s;upply a fund of argument highly gra|tifying to philo&s;ophical minds; if there are per&s;ons who a&s;&s;ert that we have nearly run the career of human affairs, that we have trod over the &s;teps of Rome, Athens and Sparta, and attained the climax of national depravity: to &s;uch men it will &s;urely appear highly nece&s;&s;ary, to exhibit the aggregate view of what lengths we have gone in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, which, by &s;triking at the root of dome&s;tic felicity, endangers the whole religion and moral character of the State. From &s;uch men, we naturally mu&s;t expect the warme&s;t patronage, and con&s;ider their approbation of our plan, as the be&s;t evidence of the warmth they feel for the welfare of their country.</P>

<HEAD>The Trial between the Right Hon. Sir Richard Wor&s;ley, Bart, and George Maurice Bi&s;&s;ett, E&s;q. Defendant, for Criminal Conver&s;ation with the Plain|tiff's Wife, on Thur&s;day 21&s;t of Feb. 1782,</HEAD>
<P>THIS Trial, not more celebrated in the annals of gallantry, than in the records of judicial proceeding; quoted alike by the gay amateurs of di&s;&s;ipated plea&s;ure, and the &s;edulous inve&s;tigator of legal bu&s;ine&s;s, we have cho&s;en for the opening of the&s;e intere&s;ting Memoirs. The volatile indifference of this modern Me&s;&s;alina, the de&s;picable meanne&s;s of her wretched Hu&s;band, and the evidence of her Gallants, now directly pointed, and now curiou&s;ly evafive, furni&s;h a &s;ource of &s;uch mingled amu&s;ement and in&s;truction, as few in&s;tances po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, or indeed of equalling.</P>
<P>This cau&s;e was tried before the Right Honourable Willlam, Earl of Mansfield, and a Special Jury.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>The Declaration &s;tated, that the defendant, on the 19th of November, 1781, and at other times between that day and the 24th of the &s;ame month, at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, in the county of Middle&s;ex; with force and arms, made an a&s;&s;ault on Seymour, the wife of the plaintiff, and then and there debauched, de&s;lowered, lay with and carnally was connected with her, the &s;aid Seymour, to the plaintiff's damage of 20,000l.</P>
<P>To this declaration the defendant pleaded not guilty, and thereupon i&s;&s;ue was joined.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e was opened by Mr. Attorney General, who &s;tated, that the plaintiff lived at Apuldurcomb, in the I&s;le of Wight, and was worth about 5000l. a year; that Lady Wor&s;ley was the daughter of Sir John Fleming, and that Sir Richard had a fortune of about 70,000l. or more with her: the plaintiff and &s;he were married on the 15th of September 1775, and had i&s;&s;ue two children, a &s;on and a daughter, that the defendant was an officer in the Hamp&s;hire Militia, of which the plaintiff was Colonel, and that their acquaintance had been only from the end of February, or commencement of March, 1781; and that it originated in con&s;equence of a bur|gage tenure Mr. Bi&s;&s;et po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the I&s;le of Wight, and which, added to an e&s;tate of 800l. a year in Somer&s;et&s;hire. made his income about 1500l. a year; this burgage-ten|ure, Sir Richard, impelled by parliamentary motives, wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e: this occa&s;ioned their fir&s;t meeting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oon afterwards Sir Richard gave Mr. Bi&s;&s;et a com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ion in his regiment. That the greate&s;t intimacy now took place between them: the plaintiff had a hou&s;e at Maid&s;tone, and the defendant, while at camp in Cox|heath,
<PB N="9" REF="033585_0008_0FF78F841A001508">
regularly vi&s;ited him there. That after the break|ing up of the camp, they came to Lewes, where Sir Richard had a hou&s;e; and Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett lodgings; and the greate&s;t friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, till that un|happy event, the ground work of this action, took place.</P>
<P>After this opening, the evidence for the plaintiff was brought forwards. The marriage of the 15th of Sep|tember 1775, was admitted. Captain Lever&s;age, an of|ficer in the Hamp&s;hire Militia, and an acquaintance and neighbour of Sir Richard's, declared, that he had no knowledge of Captain Bi&s;&s;ett, previous to his &s;eeing him on the parade a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> High Wickham, after his receiving his commi&s;&s;ion from Sir Richard; that he recollected Sir Richard Wor&s;ley and Captain Bi&s;&s;ett's being at Coxheath together: and that there &s;eemed to be the greate&s;t intima|cy between Sir Richard and his Family, and him; Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett, Captain Lever&s;age &s;aid, &s;eemed to him a man of fa&s;hion, and exten&s;ive intimacy with the brighter circle of &s;ociety. At the breaking up of the camp, he came with Sir Richard's family to Lewes, and vi&s;ited al&s;o at Maid&s;tone. Mr. Bi&s;tett had lodgings at Lewes, and was frequently at Sir Richard's hou&s;e there. On Sunday the 18th of November, Lady Wor&s;ley drank tea and &s;upped at the hou&s;e of Captain Lever&s;age, at Lewes, on the in|vitation of the Captain and his family; Captain Bi&s;&s;ett came with her. Sir Richard Wor&s;ley did not come in pur&s;uance of the invitation, but about ten o'clock in the evening, &s;ent an apology by Captain Wor&s;ley, that he was not well and wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed; that he could not attend that evening, and was then taking &s;ome &s;ack whey for his indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>This invitation to Captain Lever&s;age's hou&s;e was gen|eral: married ladies, as well as their hu&s;bands, being in|vited. Lady Wor&s;ley came about &s;even o'clock in the evening. This friendly a&s;&s;embly, Lady Wor&s;ley was the fir&s;t who attempted to break up: &s;he intimated a de&s;ire to part between twelve and one o'clock. Mrs. Lever|&s;age was apprehen&s;ive, that the company was not perfect|ly agreeable to her, by her eagerne&s;s to go, and wi&s;hed
<PB N="10" REF="033585_0009_0FF78F85DC8B2100">
her not to urge her departure; Lady Wor&s;ley &s;at down again, and Captain Bi&s;&s;ett looking at his watch, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her Lady&s;hip, &s;aid, Don't go yet; up|on this &s;he &s;taid till a quarter pa&s;t one.</P>
<P>On their departure, Captain Lever&s;age took a light, intending to accompany them home, Sir Richard's hou&s;e being nearly oppo&s;ite; he went within a few yards of the door, when Captain Bi&s;&s;ett begged he would not give him&s;elf any further trouble; on this, Captain Lever&s;age wi&s;hing them a good night, returned home. About four or five o'clock in the morning, he was awaked by a vio|ent rapping at his door: he aro&s;e directly, and going to the window, found it was one of Sir Richard's &s;ervants, who brought his ma&s;ter's compliments, and a polite me&s;|&s;age, de&s;iring Lady Wor&s;ley would come home; the Captain told him Lady Wor&s;ley had been gone ever &s;ince one o'clock: in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, Sir Richard him&s;elf appears; Lever&s;age, &s;ays he where is Lady Wor&s;ley?</P>
<P>When Captain Lever&s;age came to this occurrence, the Attorney-General, actuated, no doubt by a laudable zeal for his client's intere&s;t, &s;topt him, and after a&s;king one or two que&s;tions not very material, left him to the cro&s;s-examination of Mr. Bearcroft, from which as little remarkable occurred.</P>
<P>A Mr. Sadler proved the hand writing of Captain Bi&s;|&s;ett, in two letters; the fir&s;t evinced the friendly inter|cour&s;e which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the plaintiff and the de|fendant; it congratulated Sir Richard on his Lady's hap|py delivery of a daughter, and expre&s;&s;ed the writer's great anxiety for Lady Wor&s;ley's health, and his earne&s;t de&s;ire for her return to quarters: the &s;econd letter was wrote the morning of the elopement; inclo&s;ed the Cap|tain's commi&s;&s;ion, which Sir Richard was de&s;ired to ac|cept, and named Lord Deerhur&s;t's Cleaveland Row, as the place where an an&s;wer would be expected.</P>
<P>Francis Godfrey, a &s;ervant of Sir Richard Wor&s;ley's remembered Lady Wor&s;ley's going to Captain Lever|&s;age's; &s;he told him at going out, that if any body called
<PB N="11" REF="033585_0010_0FF78F88F82EFAF8">
for her, &s;he &s;hould not &s;up at home that evening: he &s;at up for her till between five and &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing; about five Sir Richard called him, and &s;ent him to Captain Lever&s;age's; Sir Richard, he &s;aid, appeared to be much di&s;turbed; after repeated enquiries after Lady Wor&s;ley, he was told that &s;he had left Captain Lever|&s;age's at one in the morning, accompanied by Captain Bi&s;&s;ett. This man had only lived with Sir Richard one day.</P>
<P>Mr. Stubbs, the landlord of the hou&s;e where Captain Bi&s;&s;ett lodged, did not remember his coming home on this memorable morning; but between three and four, the Captain knocked at his chamber door, and begged to light a candle; in this he was accommodated: he was then in his bed-gown, and directly returned to his room; in a &s;hort time he came out of his room and called the &s;ervant, Conolly, and begged him to go down &s;tairs; in a little time he called the man again, and then the man or &s;ome other per&s;on went out of the door; in about ten minutes the &s;a&s;h was thrown up. Mr. Stubbs go out of bed to know if the Captain wanted any thing, but was an&s;wered in the negative: &s;oon after the per&s;on, whoever it was, came in again, and ju&s;t afterwards a chai&s;e arrived at the door: it did not, however, &s;top, but went on to turn about, and &s;ome time after, the Captain and &s;ome other per&s;on went down &s;tairs, and the chai&s;e drove off.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney-General que&s;tioned what the time might be, but Lord Mansfield remarked. this is nothing but travelling a long way about; why don't you come to the point and bring them to London at once?</P>
<P>T. Bourn, the waiter at the Royal Hotel, in Pall Mall, remembered a Lady and gentleman coming there about two in the morning, of the 19th of November; he went to the chai&s;e door, and the Gentleman let the window down about half way; on his attempting to open the door, the gentleman pulled it up again: he &s;topped a &s;hort time, and the window was let down half way again, and as he was opening the door, the window was once more thrown up. Mr. We&s;ton then came to the door, and the Gen|tleman
<PB N="12" REF="033585_0011_0FF78F8CE9E59DD0">
and lady &s;tepped out; they entered the hou&s;e very quickly, and was &s;hewn up &s;tairs into a room named the Apollo, a large drawing-room, and they then ordered breakfa&s;t directly. The waiter carried breakfa&s;t up &s;tairs and prepared a bed for them as near the dining-room as he po&s;&s;ibly could, and then, &s;aid he, they went to bed.</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield a&s;ked, how he knew they went to bed: the waiter's rea&s;on for thinking &s;o was, that he went to take the things away, and they had left the dining-room. His Lord&s;hip again a&s;ked, if he &s;aw them go into the bed-room; to which he was an&s;wered, no: what induced the waiter to think they lay together in one bed, he declared, was the plain rea&s;on that there was no other bed in the room: they &s;taid at the Hotel four or five days, and during that time pa&s;&s;ed for man and wife; not that they &s;aid any thing importing that they were &s;o, but, knowing no otherwi&s;e, he &s;uppo&s;ed that to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Ann Watkin&s;on, the hou&s;e-keeper at the Royal Hotel, knew that the Lady and Gentleman, relative to whom the waiter had &s;worn, lodged in that hou&s;e, that their dining-room was called the Apollo, and their bed-cham|ber No. 14. She was ordered to prepare the bed-room and accordingly did: &s;he never &s;aw them in bed, but &s;he imagined they were, as it was prepared for them; and &s;he al&s;o heard them &s;peak in bed: &s;he &s;aw the bed after|ward, and was convinced that &s;ome per&s;on had lain in it. She never heard any conver&s;ation between them, and did not know who they were when they came into the hou&s;e, but had been informed &s;ince: when &s;he once went into the room there was a lady there, and &s;he a&s;ked Lady Wor&s;ley her name, and &s;he an&s;wered that her name was Wor&s;ley.</P>
<P>Mrs. Commande, who lived at the Royal Hotel, re|collected a Lady and Gentleman coming there, on the 19th Novem. and remaining there till the 24th &s;he did not then know them, but had &s;ince been acquainted that their names were Lady Wor&s;ley and Captain Bi&s;&s;et: they did not a&s;&s;ume any name while they remained there nor was &s;he able to ob&s;erve any thing in their behaviour,
<PB N="13" REF="033585_0012_0FF78F8E83775440">
which could empower her to judge of the form of their connexion. On the morning they went away, (the 24th) Lady Wor&s;ley's name was mentioned; the occa&s;ion was, Mrs. Commande introducing two of Sir Richard's &s;er|vants, a woman and a groom, to Lady Wor&s;ley and Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett, while they were in bed; &s;hortly afterwards, Captain Bi&s;&s;ett &s;ent for her into the dining-room, de&s;ired to know her motives for &s;hewing &s;uch per&s;ons into Lady Wor&s;ley's bed-room, and &s;aid, &s;uch behaviour to ladies of quality would not benefit their hou&s;e; it was a|bout one o'clock in the morning Mrs. Commande &s;aid, when &s;he &s;aw Lady Wor&s;ley and Captain Bi&s;&s;et in bed together.</P>
<P>A Mr. Herne only &s;aid, that he was the receiver of Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett's rents; the amount of which were 800l. or &s;omewhat better than 800l. a year.</P>
<P>This was the whole of the evidence adduced for the plaintiff; &s;everal particulars of it, perhaps, afford &s;cope for remark to the curious ob&s;erver. How au&s;picious was the commencement of the Friend&s;hip between Sir Rich|ard and the Captain! he di&s;covered, no doubt, &s;ome kin|dred virtue in the brea&s;t of Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett, which attached him by the mo&s;t congenial &s;ympathy. With the view of having &s;o valued a friend near him, he offers him a com|mi&s;&s;ion in that part of the Hamp&s;hire Militia, which he him&s;elf commands: yet luckier, the Captain entertains as high a regard for <HI>Lady</HI> Wor&s;ley as for his friend; doubt|le&s;s, at fir&s;t, a very pure attachment! but then comes this unfortunate invitation to a friend's hou&s;e, and &s;till more unfortunately at this very cri&s;is, poor Sir Richard finds him&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed, and is nece&s;&s;itated to remain at home, nur&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ack whey, whil&s;t the &s;cheme of his blacke&s;t di&s;honour is planning; his wife and her lover, tempted by the opportunity, at once forfeit all their claims to virtue, and elope: the romantic attachment of the friends, is in a moment di&s;&s;olved. Sir Richard, with a patience truly exemplary, waits till five in the morning, and then &s;ends his man to beg his Lady to return home; he comes back with the doleful inteligence, that &s;he has
<PB N="14" REF="033585_0013_0FF78F9063515220">
left the hou&s;e where &s;he &s;upped, &s;ome hours, in company with her guardian Captain. Sir Richard is &s;tark raving mad at this news, and immediately repairs to his friend's hou&s;e; after alarming the whole neighbourhood, he can gain no better tidings&punc; but here the prudence of his coun|&s;el, the Attorney-General, interrupted Captain Lever|&s;age's evidence, and prevented our hearing tho&s;e effecting bur&s;ts of tender anxiety, which mu&s;t have placed Sir Rich|ard's character in the mo&s;t amiable point of view; how|ever, let us in pity hope, that the &s;ituation of his mind was not &s;o cruelly agonizing, as to have rendered Shake&s;pear's lines applicable to him:

We will rather &s;uppo&s;e that another potion of that &s;ack whey which unque&s;tionably &s;upported him during the ab&s;ence of Lady Wor&s;ley, re&s;tored tranquility to his ag|itated mind; we cannot even imagine, that his re&s;entment was &s;o bitter, as to induce him to order his &s;ervants to penetrate the room where there Lady &s;lept, and thereby give occa&s;ion to tho&s;e pathetic remon&s;trances, which his friend Captain B. was obliged to make u&s;e of to the offi|cious waiting-woman, who &s;o impertinently intruded them into the pre&s;ence of <HI>a lady of quality.</HI></P>
<P>The evidence for the defendant now came forwards; and Mr. Bearcroft, in an&s;wer to this evidence, did not at|tempt to make any defence in controvertion of the charge exhibited again&s;t the defendant, but was very ready to admit, that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. The only que&s;tion which then remained was upon the &s;ubject of damages; in mitigation of which only he would de|fend his client; and did not doubt to prove, to the &s;ati&s;|faction of the jury, that Sir Richard not only acquie&s;ced under repeated acts of his own di&s;honour with various per&s;ons, but even excited and encouraged it: on which&mdash;</P>

to, or con&s;enting at all, or contributing to the debauch|ery of his wife, or joins in it, he ought not to recover a verdict.</P>
<P>Mr. Bearcroft then &s;tated, that he could not only prove this to be the fact, but that he &s;hould prove by the af|fidavits of the woman who attended the bath at Maid|&s;tone, that the plaintiff there had ab&s;olutely rai&s;ed the de|fendant upon his &s;houlders, to view his naked wife while bathing, and at the &s;ame time called to her, &s;aying, Sey|mour! Seymour! <HI>Bi&s;ett is looking at you!</HI> and that &s;he, on coming out after &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, joined the Gentlemen; and they all went off together in a hearty laugh at the tran&s;action which had pa&s;&s;ed. The bathing-woman was ill, and could not attend the trial her&s;elf to give evidence of this fact; but that it had been agreed be|tween the parties, that the attornies on each &s;ide &s;hould go down to the place for the purpo&s;e of taking the affida|vits, and in order to view the &s;ituation, which they had done, and which affidavits would be read.</P>
<P>That the defendant could not po&s;&s;ibly be the father of the child born in Augu&s;t la&s;t, as his fir&s;t acquaintance with the plaintiff commenced only in March; &s;o that he had not ba&s;tardized the plaintiff's i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>He wondered why they had not called &s;ome per&s;ons belonging to, or about the family, in orderto prove how the parties lived together; a circum&s;tance very material in a ca&s;e like this: they had only called one per&s;on be|longing to the family; and that was the butler, who had lived in the hou&s;e but one day, and who, of cour&s;e, could not &s;peak to that point.</P>
<P>That the licentious conduct of Lady Wor&s;ley, was &s;o notorious, that it had been the &s;ubject of common con|ver&s;ation; and that many Ladies of di&s;tinction, in the I&s;le of Wight and el&s;where, had frequently remon&s;trated with Sir Richard on that &s;ubject, and told him, that if he did not attempt to re&s;train her conduct, her character would be ruined and de&s;troyed; that the an&s;wer Sir Rich|ard made was, that Lady Wor&s;ley liked it, and he cho&s;e to do it to oblige her; upon which a very &s;en&s;ible Lady,

<P>Mary Mariott being unable to attend the trial, the following affidavits were read.</P>
<P>Mary Mariott depo&s;ed, that Lady Wor&s;ley u&s;ed to come to the cold bath, near Maid&s;tone, to bathe, and that &s;he u&s;ed to attend her; that Sir Richard and Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett were generally with her; and that the la&s;t time &s;he came, which was about noon, in September la&s;t, and at the latter end of the hop-&s;ea&s;on, Sir Richard Wor&s;ley and Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett &s;taid at the door without, while &s;he ba|thed; that after &s;he had bathed, &s;he retired into a corner to put on her &s;hift, as Ladies u&s;ually do after bathing, and then returned to dre&s;s her&s;elf, and &s;at her&s;elf down on the &s;eat: that there is a window over the door of the building in which the bath is, and which is the only inle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for light into the bath, and from which any per&s;on, who is &s;itting down on the &s;eat, may be &s;een, but not when re|tired into the corner; that when &s;he had almo&s;t fini&s;hed dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, Sir Richard tapped at the door, and &s;aid, "Seymour! Seymour! Bi&s;&s;ett is going to get up to look at you," or words to that effect; and, looking round, &s;he &s;aw his face at the window; that he continued there about five minuets; that &s;he did not &s;ee the plaintiff on the out|&s;ide, but believes he mu&s;t help the defendant up; and that after Lady Wor&s;ley had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, &s;he went out, and they were all mery and laughing together: that, excepting this, &s;he never &s;aw any improper conduct or behaviour in the &s;aid three per&s;ons, unle&s;s what is above &s;tated may be thought &s;o.</P>
<P>In addition to this, there was another affidavit read, in which &s;he <HI>believed</HI> that Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett could <HI>not</HI> have got up to the window, unle&s;s he had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sir

Richard, or &s;tood upon his &s;houlders; and that Sir Rich|ard might ea&s;ily have pulled him down if he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Right Honourable Lord Deerhur&s;t &s;aid, that he was fir&s;t acquainted with Lady Wor&s;ley, in the year 1779: he e&s;teemed her conduct as very di&s;&s;olute, and thought that conjugal fidelity was not one of her vir|tues: he was intimate with Sir Richard, but never wit|ne&s;&s;ed any exertions made by him, to check the lewd depravity of her life. His Lord&s;hip being on a vi&s;it at Sir Richard's hou&s;e, in the I&s;le of Wight; Sir Richard &s;eeing Lady Wor&s;ley pa&s;s by the window, &s;aid to Lord Deerhur&s;t, that many young men had a&s;&s;ailed her virtue: but that all had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that he gave him full liberty to attempt her cha&s;tity, this his Lord|&s;hip con&s;idered as the effect of a light and airy man|ner; and this Lord Mansfield &s;aid, went for nothing. Lord Deerhur&s;t continued at Sir Richard's hou&s;e ten days; during that time, Sir Richard once found him in the dre&s;&s;ing-room adjacent to her Lady&s;hip's bed-cham|ber, at four o'clock in the morning. Sir Richard pre|tended amazement at finding him there, and exclaimed, Deerhur&s;t, how came you here? after that his Lord&s;hip retired to his bed-chamber; he was, however, &s;uffered to attend Lady Wor&s;ley, as if no remarkable occurrence had taken place: he attended her to Southampton, at King&s;ton and Godalmin, at all the&s;e places alone, and with the knowledge of Sir Richard. At King&s;ton and Godalmin, Lord Deerhur&s;t met her by apointment. Mr. Howarth, one of the defendant's coun&s;el, a&s;ked his Lord&s;hip, if he was criminally connected with Lady Wor&s;ley at the la&s;t-mentioned place; but his Lord&s;hip claimed the protection of the Judge, and Lord Man&s;|field decided, that it was a que&s;tion he had no right to an&s;wer. On the cro&s;s examination of Mr. Attorney-General, Lord Deerhur&s;t denied any particular permi&s;|&s;ion from Sir Richard to attend Lady Wor&s;ley, and &s;aid, that other Gentlemen attended her Lady&s;hip, without objection from Sir Richard. His Lord&s;hip acknow|ledged carrying a me&s;&s;age from Sir Richard to Lady
<PB N="18" REF="033585_0017_0FF78F9B6D166F48">
Wor&s;ley at the Hotel, and receiving for an&s;wer, that he might inform Sir Richard, that it was in vain for him to attempt the recovery of Lady Wor&s;ley, as &s;he was de|termined never to unite with him again.</P>
<P>The acquaintance of Lord Peterborough with Lady Wor&s;ley, commenced nearly about the opening of Rane|lagh, in the year 1780: he was fir&s;t introduced to her at Sadler's Wells, by Lord Deerhur&s;t; he had not any in|timacy with Sir Richard, either then or afterwards, nor even &s;poke to him during his acquaintance with Lady Wor&s;ley: he made no remarks on the behaviour of Sir Richard and his Lady, as he never &s;aw them together, but did not think her conduct quite con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a decent and virtuous married woman.</P>
<P>Bouchier Smith, E&s;q. was acquainted with Lady Wor|&s;ley, in the year 1779; he thought &s;he betrayed a great di&s;regard of character; he was in company with Lady Wor&s;ley, on a party at Shooter's Hill, when they met Sir Richard in a phaeton, and her Lady&s;hip many times a&s;ked him to accompany them, but he refu&s;ed, and &s;et off for town; he did not remark any thing el&s;e particu|lar that day.</P>
<P>The Marquis of Graham's acquaintance with Lady Wor&s;ley, begun four years prior to the trial; he had no intimacy with Sir Richard, he &s;ometimes vi&s;ited at his hou&s;e, but not frequently. Lady Wor&s;ley was gay, free, and airy, in a manner he thought carried rather too far for a married woman; he did not ob&s;erve any ab&s;olute impropriety or immode&s;ty in her conduct, as far as it re|&s;pected conver&s;ation: to a que&s;tion which nearly related to him&s;elf, the Marquis refu&s;ed to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>A Mr. Clark gave an account of the fir&s;t interview be|tween Sir Richard Wor&s;ley and Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett, and the oc|ca&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>The Honourable Charles Wyndham's acquaintance with Lady Wor&s;ley, commenced between three and four years before the trial: he was not accquainted with Sir Richard at that time, and &s;ince his intimacy has been very &s;light: he never thought the conduct of Lady Wor|&s;ley
<PB N="19" REF="033585_0018_0FF78FA0C9C937F0">
becoming; he remembered Lady Wor&s;ley's pre&s;ent|ing him with a gold-ring in Ken&s;ington Gardens.</P>
<P>Doctor O&s;born remembered Lady Wor&s;ley about Au|gu&s;t, in the year 1780, at Sir Richard's hou&s;e in town: being que&s;tioned as to the condition he found her in, he replied, 'Between a patient and a phy&s;ician, there is an implied &s;ecrecy; the nature of the ca&s;e required it, and that being the &s;tate of the ca&s;e I &s;hould hardly conceive my&s;elf at liberty to declare it; but I have the Lady's per|mi&s;&s;ion to give the truth: he &s;aid, he was not employed by Sir Richard: being again que&s;tioned as to the &s;itua|tion in which he found her, he replied, 'I believe it was never known; at lea&s;t I never was a&s;ked my opinion of the di&s;order; nor did I think it nece&s;&s;ary to mention it, my bu&s;ine&s;s was to cure her; and I do not chu&s;e to talk upon the &s;ubject, one way or other.'

<P>Here the evidence for the defendant clo&s;ed. Mr. J. Farrer, the plaintiff's attorney, was brought forwards and &s;worn on his behalf: he &s;aid, he went down to the cold bath mentioned in the affidavit; he &s;aw the place on which Mr. Bi&s;&s;ett got to look into the bath, and believed that he might mount it with a great deal of ea&s;e, and without the help of Sir Richard; it was about brea&s;t high; there was an arm chair placed on the out&s;ide; and when he was on the chair, he &s;aid, he could rai&s;e him&s;elf to the window with great facility: the window was about four feet high, and the &s;eat on the out&s;ide of the bath.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney-General made a &s;hort reply on the &s;ub|ject of damages.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD MANSFIELD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury,</P>
<P>There ari&s;es upon this evidence a &s;erious que&s;tion for your con&s;ideration.&mdash;The nature of the action is &s;uch, that the defendant cannot confe&s;s a verdict, becau&s;e this
<PB N="20" REF="033585_0019_0FF78FA2607C8F10">
is between the Hu&s;band and Wife and the Adulterer; and further proceedings may be had; therefore, the ver|dict, you give mu&s;t be out of the truth and ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e, and the ju&s;tice of the evidence.</P>
<P>Now, the &s;ingle que&s;tion is, Whether Sir Richard has not been privy to the pro&s;titution of his wife? a&s;&s;enting to, and encouraging and exciting even this defendant? And, if he is &s;o, upon your opinion of the evidence, he ought <HI>not</HI> to recover in this action&mdash;if he is not, why then the only que&s;tion that remains, is upon the &s;ubject of damages; upon which I will not &s;ay a word to you. You are the be&s;t judges of that.</P>
<P>This woman, for three or four years, has been pro&s;|tituted with a variety of people; that is extremely clear. A &s;tronger in&s;tance than the Doctor's appearance this day, and what he has &s;aid, need not have been brought. &mdash;In the year 1779, Lord Deerhur&s;t knew Lady Wor&s;ley; &s;he was very profligate, and no &s;tep was taken by Sir Richard to prevent her: he continued in the i&s;le of Wight ten days, and he has mentioned a conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between them and Sir Richard, which ought to be laid out of the ca&s;e, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be ironical: "That many young men had tried her, without &s;ucce&s;s; and that he might take his chance with her." But he &s;ays, once the plaintiff found him in Lady Wor&s;ley's dre&s;&s;ing-room at four o'clock in the morning; and he only &s;ays to him, "Deerhur&s;t, how came you here?" And there is no further explanation or examination between them. Is it not extraordinary to find a Gentleman in his Lady's dre&s;s|ing room at four o'clock in the morning; and nothing fur|ther &s;aid? All is well; they are all good company the next morning; and &s;ome few days afterwards, Lady Wor&s;ley is going to Southampton. At the &s;ame time Sir Rich|ard goes eight miles with her, and leaves Lord Deerhur&s;t to go on with her to Southampton: he goes on with her to Southampton; he &s;tays there twenty-four hours, and &s;he &s;tays three or four days:&mdash;<HI>yet there is no appearance of jealou&s;y in the Hu&s;band!</HI> This evidence de&s;erves your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="033585_0020_0FF78FA4303A5BF8">Another piece of evidence is, that of the woman at the bath at Maid&s;tone; &s;he &s;wears, &s;he <HI>believes</HI> it was im|po&s;&s;ible for Mr. Bi&s;&s;et to have got up the height of the balcony, to look into the bath, unle&s;s he had &s;tood up|on Sir Richard's &s;houlders: but this is matter of belief; and they have called the Attorney, and you have heard his evidence: he went down there to take the affidavits: he &s;ays he got up with a great deal of ea&s;e, and with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that he got up fir&s;t on an arm-chair which &s;tood on the out&s;ide of the bath; and then it was only four feet above him; &s;o that, if he had not &s;tood upon Sir Richard's &s;houlders, he might ea&s;ily have pulled him down if he plea&s;ed; in&s;tead of which, he only taps at the door, and &s;ays Seymore! Seymore! <HI>Bi&s;&s;ett is looking at you.</HI> And when &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed and comes out, &s;he joins them, and they are all jolly and merry, and laughing, and &s;o away together.</P>
<P>This is the evidence which they have given; and if upon that evidence you think the Hu&s;band was privy to con|&s;enting, and encouraging this debauchery, he ought not to have your verdict; but if you think he is entitled to your verdict, then the only point for your con&s;ideration is, What damages you will give&mdash;You will con&s;ider of your verdict, and give what damages you think proper.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Jury went out of court, and after debating near an hour, returned with a verdict for the plaintiff, giving him <HI>only One Shilling</HI> damages.</P>
<P>The whole of the evidence for the defendant, is not le&s;s curious than the te&s;timony brought forwards in favour of the plaintiff: the remark made by the Lady, who had &s;o frequently advi&s;ed Sir Richard on the conduct of his Wife, mu&s;t have been peculiarly grateful to a man of his refined and delicate &s;entiments; when his amiable good nature prevented him from repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e irregularities of Lady Wor&s;ley's conduct, which their mutual friends apprehended, might terminate &s;o di&s;agreeably, the kind compliment of his being the mo&s;t <HI>contented</HI>&mdash;Hu&s;band the Lady ever knew, mu&s;t have been particularly con&s;oling: and the word Hu&s;band &s;o kindly &s;ub&s;tituted for that of
<PB N="22" REF="033585_0021_0FF78FA5F05444C8">
Cuckold! but how was this poor Gentleman deluded through the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s? relying on that virtue, he had intuitively di&s;covered in the bo&s;om of Captain Bi&s;&s;ett, he with the mo&s;t unaffected &s;implicity, and &s;upe|riority to mean &s;u&s;picion, a&s;&s;i&s;ted that Gentleman in tak|ing a &s;urvey of Lady Wor&s;ley's charms, when uncovered in the bath. And yet perhaps, this was the fir&s;t temptation which &s;hook his friend's virtue, though none of the parties betrayed any &s;ymptoms of apprehen&s;ion, that any thing wrong had happened, but retired laughing, joking; com|pletely merry, happy, and wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Richard's conduct, with re&s;pect to Lord Deerhur&s;t, was not le&s;s expre&s;&s;ive of confidence in his wife: and here the ob&s;ervation mu&s;t &s;trike us, of that general want of acquaintance with Sir Richard, which mo&s;t of the young men of fa&s;hion who appeared on the Trial pro|fe&s;&s;ed: though &s;o friendly with his Lady, they knew but little of him; doubtle&s;s, the elevation of Sir Richard's integrity, and the refined purity of his &s;entiments, were circum&s;tances but little congenial to the pur&s;uits and at|tachments of tho&s;e characters; their particular re&s;erve, however, as to betraying any circum&s;tances which might have affected the Lady's honour, may be urged as an exception in favour of their nicety: what could be a great|er in&s;tance of Sir Richard's purity, than his obliging per|mi&s;&s;ion to Lord Deerhur&s;t, to a&s;&s;ail the virtue of Lady Wor&s;ley; or the good natured manner in which he pa&s;&s;ed over the extraordinary circum&s;tance of his being &s;o near her bed-chamber, at four o'clock in the morning! This could have aro&s;e from nothing but the con&s;cious virtue of Sir Richard's own immaculate bo&s;om: and how mu&s;t we commi&s;erate, that &s;o amiable a man &s;hould &s;uffer by fraud and deception!</P>
<P>To have &s;een things in the light Sir Richard did, he doubtle&s;s mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a different kind of vi&s;ion from that of per&s;ons in general: perhaps a &s;omewhat re|&s;embled the 'poetical &s;econd &s;ight' of Puff in the Critic, when the di&s;tracted heroine of the Poet's Tragedy, is ra|ving, in all the agonies of de&s;pair, for the lo&s;s of her lover,

the in&s;piration of the Mu&s;es pourtrays the Spani&s;h Fleet in the livelie&s;t colours to her di&s;turbed mind; but her fa|ther, who, to u&s;e the language of Puff's friend, 'makes an allowance for this poetical &s;econd &s;ight,' declares, that the 'Spani&s;h fleet &s;he cannot &s;ee, becau&s;e <HI>'tis not in &s;ight.</HI>' The character of this father is repre&s;ented by the Author, as that of a 'plain matter of fact man;' exactly this 'plain matter of fact man,' was Lord Mansfield: ca&s;ting wide the poetic fiction, a fancied &s;econd &s;ight, or whatever mode of refined illu&s;ion Sir Richard might be impelled by; he appealed only to well atte&s;ted and corroborated circum&s;tances; and directing the Jury by irre&s;i&s;tible ar|gument, left to the Baronet the &s;ad recompence afforded him by the verdict.</P>
<P>What the feelings of Sir Richard were, when he heard the determination, it would not be very ea&s;y to imagine: the contemptuous pity of his friends, the indig|nation of the Public, and the &s;entiments of his own mind, mu&s;t have afforded a happy combination: the impartial Public did not he&s;itate in giving their judgment, and all po&s;terity who may hear of the curious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, will find no difficulty in delivering an adequate deci&s;ion.</P>

Saunders, addre&s;&s;ed to her, de&s;iring her to read it at her lei&s;ure; and that &s;uch letter contained many &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ions of love and regard; and mentioned, if James Al|tham was to die, he would leave her two hundred pounds; and that, if his wife died, he would marry her, if he had not a quarter of an hour to live.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the &s;um of &s;ixty pounds was afterwards paid by the &s;aid Rev. James Altham, that &s;uch letter might be cancelled, and all conver&s;ation relating thereto, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,</P>
<P N="3">III. That the Rev. James Altham appointed to meet Ann Saunders in a place called the Shrubbery, and that &s;he met him accordingly; and that then and there the Rev. James Altham, and Ann Saunders, committed the crime of adultery together; and that, on another day, James Altham prevailed on Ann Saunders to lie with him, in the entry or pa&s;&s;age of the hou&s;e inhabited by Mr. John Edwards.</P>
<P N="4">IV. James Altham is charged with having confe&s;&s;ed that he had twice lain with the &s;aid Ann Saunders, and thereby committed the crime of adultery with her.</P>
<P N="5">V. That he is vicar of St. Olave Jewry, and rector of St. Martin, Ironmonger-lane.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That, &s;peaking of his amours in public company, affirmed that Mrs. Elizabeth Wenham had ki&s;&s;ed and &s;macked him, and called him "her dear Jemmy;" that he &s;poke very indecently of the &s;aid Mrs. Elizabeth Wen|ham; and intimated that her ha&s;band, Mr. John Wen|ham, was not a &s;ufficient man for her; and that Mrs. Wenham wanted him, the &s;aid James Altham, to lie with her.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That he had &s;aid that he was of a very warm con|&s;titution, and that he had been concerned with fifty wo|men in the pari&s;h of Harlow, in E&s;&s;ex; and, as a proof of the warmth of his con&s;titution, that he went home and laid with his wife immediately after lying with Ann Saunders in the Shrubbery.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That he had &s;aid he kept a girl whil&s;t he was at college, and mentioned how he &s;upported her. That he
<PB N="27" REF="033585_0026_0FF78FB415F765D8">
was very unguarded in his conver&s;ation, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed him in ob&s;cene and indecent terms, &s;uch as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e highly improper for a clergyman to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That he frequently importuned Ann Tavner to be criminally acquainted with him; and tried his utmo&s;t to prevail on her to con&s;ent to gratify his criminal inclina|tions, by promi&s;ing what a friend he would be to her. That after trying every method of per&s;ua&s;ion with her, he even attempted to force her; and once, in particular, he called upon her in the morning, and began putting his hand in her bo&s;om, and then tried to put his hand up her petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches; and, if &s;he had not re&s;i&s;ted to her utmo&s;t, &s;he verily believes he would have carnally known her, and thereby have committed the crime of adultery.</P>
<P N="10">X. That he called on Sarah Smith, wife of James Smith, of Harlow, and endeavoured to prevail on her to take her &s;i&s;ter, Ann Saunders, from Mr. Edwards's, where &s;he then lived as a &s;ervant, becau&s;e Mr. Edwards was a &s;ingle man; and that he then told Sarah Smith, that he loved Ann Saunders beyond any other woman; that he had been dying for her eight or nine months; and that was the rea&s;on why he wi&s;hed &s;he would take her from Mr. Edwards's, that he had even fainted away when he had &s;een her; and that Mrs. Altham had told him &s;he was &s;ure he loved that girl, that he had made Ann Saun|ders &s;ome pre&s;ents.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The libel further &s;ets forth, that Ann Saunders confe&s;&s;ed, that James Altham had once lain with her in the Shrubbery, behind Mr. Edwards's hou&s;e; and a|nother time in the entry or pa&s;&s;age of the &s;aid hou&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ann Saunders of Oakely, in E&s;&s;ex, who was aged &s;e|venteen years and upwards, &s;aid, that &s;he knew James Al|tham for &s;ix years pa&s;t, by living &s;ervant at Dr. Fi&s;her's in Harlow, where Mr. Altham frequently vi&s;ited; and further verified his per&s;on as being a prie&s;t in holy orders, and a married man.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, it was about the latter end of 1778, when Mr. Altham fir&s;t began to take particular notice of her,
<PB N="28" REF="033585_0027_0FF78FB6E625F208">
by taking hold of her, and &s;queezing her hand, &s;miling upon her, and making u&s;e of very endearing expre&s;&s;ions. And that a &s;hort time before Chri&s;tmas in that year, he met her and one Elizabeth Purkis, as they were walk|ing in the road; that he called her to him, and &s;aid he wan|ted to &s;peak to her, and that going about nine or ten yards from Elizabeth Purkis, he a&s;ked her if &s;he would accept of a pair of &s;ilver buckles, which &s;he refu&s;ed, &s;ay|ing, &s;he did not want any, and that &s;he would not accept them: they then parted.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after, it &s;eems Mr. Altham came to her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and put a pair of &s;ilver buckles in her hand, and immediately went into the parlour. On the Ea&s;ter Sunday following, he gave her a pocket-book with a &s;ilver cla&s;p, and a &s;et of in&s;truments.&mdash;In June follow|ing, he took many opportunities of frequenting her com|pany and being alone with her, when he behaved with the utmo&s;t fondne&s;s and affection.&mdash;About this time, it &s;eems he gave her a letter, and told her to read it at her lei&s;ure, and then either return it to him, or burn it: this letter con|tained many &s;trong profe&s;&s;ions of love and regard for her; and particularly mentioned, that if Mrs. Altham was to die he would marry Ann Saunders, even if he had not a quarter of an hour to live.&mdash;Ann Saunders &s;eemed well acquainted with Mr. Altham's hand writing.</P>
<P>This letter, it appears, being accidentally found in Ann Saunders's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by her brother, the circum&s;tance &s;oon came to the ears of Mr. Altham, who employed &s;ome of her relatives, and a Mr. Lu&s;hington, to get it out of their hands; but as they could not obtain this letter by per&s;ua&s;ion, Mr. Lu&s;hington, at length, paid &s;ixty pounds on Mr. Altham's account, and it was then given up.&mdash; Yet &s;o &s;trong was the de&s;ire of this gentleman, for the enjoyment of the per&s;on of Ann Saunders, that the pay|ment of this money by no means abated his ardour: on the contrary, according to her own te&s;timony, &s;he very &s;oon after met him in the Shrubbery by appointment. The time being evening, and after dark, was perfectly Congenial to the good man's de&s;igns; for, according to
<PB N="29" REF="033585_0028_0FF78FB882AFE1A8">
the young lady's own account, he there and then prevail|ed over her to lie with him&mdash;&s;o that in the &s;tarched phra&s;e of the law, they had the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies; and thereby committed the foul crimes of fornication, adultery, and incontinence.</P>
<P>This occurred in the month of April; but about the lat|ter end of May, Mr. Altham happening to find her alone in the hou&s;e of Mr. Edwards, at Harlow, again prevailed upon her to lie with him in the entry or pa&s;&s;age of the hou&s;e. It &s;eems, that &s;he propo&s;ed going up &s;tairs into a room, but the godly zeal of this good man was &s;o warm, that he in&s;i&s;ted upon fulfilling the fir&s;t great command, "Increa&s;e and multiply," in the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this renewed intimacy, it &s;eems that Mr. Altham was frequently &s;oliciting Ann Saunders, to come and live with him.&mdash;It is to be ob&s;erved, that this gentleman's friends &s;et up the plea of in&s;anity; in excu&s;e for his conduct; and if even this plea was valid, it mu&s;t be admitted, upon his telling Ann Edwards, that he would not mind murdering his wife and children, if &s;he would come and live with him, or words to the very &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>Some particulars, in this extraordinary trial, offer a variety of reflections to the philo&s;ophical ob&s;erver.&mdash;Mr. Altham, appears to have been continually boa&s;ting to the women, of his prowe&s;s in the feats of love, and the varie|ty of his connections with the &s;ex. Few, very few wo|men indeed, cordially de&s;pi&s;e a rake: Mr. Altham's &s;uc|ce&s;s plainly proves it: while, lamentable to be told, any preten&s;ion to extraordinary virtue, or cha&s;tity in the male &s;ex, is univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash;'Oh Lud! A fellow's cha&s;|tity,' &s;ays an old lady in a drama; 'why, I never heard of &s;uch a thing in my life!'&mdash;Conformably to this maxim, it &s;eems Mr. Altham had told Ann Saunders, that he could lie with Mrs. Seed, a married woman, whenever he cho&s;e or with her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth Seed, both of Harlow. In|deed, it does not &s;eem that this gentleman thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ny thing &s;o much, as of increa&s;ing the lambs of his flock.</P>
<P>As we have treated of the letter, and the negociation in general terms, we &s;hall now come to its contents, and
<PB N="30" REF="033585_0029_0FF78FBA322ED510">
the manner of its being di&s;covered. It &s;eems, that Mr. John Edwards, &s;urgeon and man-midwife, of Harlow, with whom Ann Saunders lived &s;ervant, being one day in want of a pen and ink, he went into a room oppo&s;ite to her's, which was not u&s;ed, where he &s;aw &s;everal papers lying upon a &s;helf, and among them a letter addre&s;&s;ed, "Dear Nanny!" he &s;oon knew this to be Mr. Altham's hand-writing; and as he directly conceived there had been an intimacy between the parties, it al&s;o occurred to him, how urgent Mr. Altham had been with Ann Saunders's &s;i&s;ter, to take her away from his hou&s;e (Mr. Edwards's), under the idea that he being a &s;ingle man and living almo&s;t alone, made it exceeding dangerous for a young woman to &s;tay with him!&mdash;Mr. Edwards as it is natural to &s;up|po&s;e, immediately read the contents of this curious Epi&s;tle; and it is much to be regretted, that a copy of it was not pre&s;erved: there is no doubt, that as it was got out of the hands of the oppo&s;ite party, for the con&s;idera|tion of &s;ixty pounds, it was immediately and totally de|&s;troyed. It is certain, that it contained the following ver&s;es:
<Q><L>Dear maid, &s;ince thou ha&s;t charm'd my &s;ight,</L>
<L>Oh let my arms thy neck infold;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e brea&s;ts &s;o fair, tho&s;e eyes &s;o bright,</L>
<L>What joy, what plea&s;ure to behold!</L></Q></P>
<P>The young woman to whom this was addre&s;&s;ed, it &s;eems, was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the danger of this precious e|pi&s;tle, as Mr. Edwards had hardly come out of the apart|ment, when he met her coming in with great ha&s;te; he in|formed her that he knew what &s;he was in &s;uch ha&s;te about, but that he had got the letter in his pocket, and was de|termined to &s;hew it to her &s;i&s;ter. She then pre&s;&s;ed him very hard to deliver it up to her, but as he peremptorily refu&s;ed it, &s;he began crying; but this was to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>So far from this indulgence, Mr. Edwards happening to &s;ee Mr. Smith and his wife, the brother and &s;i&s;ter of Ann Saunders, that day, he read the contents of it to them but did not give them the letter. It is commonly &s;aid, that a woman cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> keep a &s;ecret; but from this and a
<PB N="31" REF="033585_0030_0FF78FBD50FD03A8">
thou&s;and other in&s;tances, it is highly probable, that that proverb is equally applicable to the men.</P>
<P>The next day it &s;eems, Mr. Edwards met Mr. Altham in the fields, and after walking together &s;ome time, he introduced the affair of Ann Saunders; at lea&s;t &s;o much of it as had then got abroad: in reply to which, Mr. Al|tham readily confe&s;&s;ed that he had lain with her, but was very reluctant in acknowledging the letter in que&s;tion. He indeed confe&s;&s;ed, that he had written to her, but in|tirely declined entering into any particulars.</P>
<P>The letter, in a few days after, was given by Mr. Ed|wards to Mrs. Smith, the &s;i&s;ter of Ann Saunders; and it was al&s;o &s;hewn to a number of per&s;ons, mo&s;t of whom identified it as the genuine hand-writing of the Reverend James Altham.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, that when Mr. Lu&s;hington came to Ann Saunders's friends, to agree with them to have it given up, he at fir&s;t offered her but ten ponds; however, her brother had the addre&s;s to increa&s;e this price to &s;ixty, which was paid in the cour&s;e of a few days:&mdash;and when finally given up, it was remembered, among other warm expre&s;&s;ions, that Mr. Altham would never cea&s;e to love her as long as he lived; and only reque&s;ted, that &s;he would let him be an hour, or a night alone with her; he al&s;o a&s;ked her &s;hortly after, whether, if he parted with his wife, &s;he would come and live with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards al&s;o depo&s;ed, that in conver&s;ation with the Rev. James Altham, he had confe&s;&s;ed to him, that he was of a very warm con&s;titution, and that he had been concerned with fifty women in the town and pari&s;h of Harlow; and as a particular in&s;tance of the vigour of his con&s;titution, he further informed him, that directly after lying with Ann Saunders in the &s;hrubbery, he went home and immediately obliged his wife to undergo the &s;ame proof of his amorous affections.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that in cour&s;e of this trial, &s;everal of the witne&s;&s;es were a&s;ked, if they really believed that Mr. Altham was in&s;ane; to this, the general an&s;wer was Dr. Monro's excepted, that they had heard that he had been
<PB N="32" REF="033585_0031_0FF78FC198343A60">
put in a private mad-hou&s;e under the care of Doctor Monro, but that this was &s;u&s;pected to have been done by his relations, merely to evade the force of the law.</P>
<P>William Poole of Sheering, farmer, aged &s;ixty-&s;ix, depo&s;ed, that he had been rather intimately acquainted with Mr. Altham, and that at the Tythe-fea&s;t, at Harlow, Mr. Altham, after dinner; and &s;itting down with &s;ome of the pari&s;hioners and inhabitants, introduced a conver&s;ation about dogs, and particularly &s;aid, "that he had a great pa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e animals, and women too;" to which W. Poole replied, Yes, Sir, I believe it, and you have paid for it lately, alluding to his connection with Ann Saun|ders. Mr. Altham then expre&s;&s;ed great virulence again&s;t the people who concerned them&s;elves in that bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;aid, he would &s;hoot two or three of them if it was not for the law. To this Poole an&s;wered, he &s;hould not talk of &s;hooting people, though to be &s;ure he was a man of great &s;pirit. That I am, rejoined Altham; and he immediately went on to tell them that he kept a girl when at college and even mentioned how he &s;upported her. He informed the company at the &s;ame time that the wife of John Wenham, E&s;q. was over head and ears in love with him; that &s;he was at his hou&s;e the other day, and ki&s;&s;ed him, and &s;macked him, and called him her dear Jemmy, O my dear Jemmy! and the like; and that at Dr. Legas's, &s;he a&s;ked him to have her.&mdash;To this one Edward Wife, who was pre&s;ent, &s;aid in a &s;erious manner&mdash;Aye! what can &s;he want to have you for? What, &s;aid Mr. Altham, why to r...r her, to be &s;ure. Mr. Poole then &s;aid to him, do you con&s;ider that you are a clergyman, and a ju&s;tice of peace; I think this conver&s;ation may give you a great deal of trouble; to which Mr. Altham replied, he did not care for any body.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this evidence it al&s;o appeared, that Mr. Altham had been married to two wives, before the one he then had; but that he had treated them both with much tenderne&s;s and affection.</P>
<P>Ann Tavner, wife of Francis Tavner of Harlow,
<PB N="33" REF="033585_0032_0FF78FC3330B42C0">
&s;wore, that about November 1776 her hu&s;band was arre&s;ted for debt, and confined in Chelmsford Goal; and that when Mr. Altham heard of it, he came to her to enquire into her hu&s;band's affairs, and &s;aid he would do his utmo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, or to that ef|fect; and that he always promi&s;ed to be a friend to her, and particularly mentioned, that he would get her hu&s;band out of goal in a fortnight's time. After this, he began to call upon her very frequent|ly, &s;ometimes every day, and generally three or four days in the week; &s;till he did not procure her hu&s;band's enlargement till four or five months after he had propo&s;ed it. During this time, he had made particularly free with her, taking very great li|berties; &s;uch as putting his hands in her bo&s;om, and attempting to put them up her petticoats. In addition to this, he very frequently &s;olicited her to be criminally acquainted with him, trying his utmo&s;t to prevail upon her: &s;ometimes, after he had exhau&s;ted him&s;elf in per&s;ua&s;ions, he would even attempt open force; particularly one morning in Feb. 1777, when he began putting his hand into her bo&s;om, and then tried to put it up her petticoats, after he had unbuttoned and opened his breeches; when &s;he really believed, that if &s;he had not re&s;i&s;ted to the utmo&s;t degree, by &s;truggling and falling up|on her knees with her cloaths under her, he certain|ly would have had the carnal knowledge of her body. To this &s;he added, that &s;he thought his be|haviour &s;o barbarous, that &s;he could not help cry|ing.</P>
<P>Here it appears, in favour of Mr. Altham, that he was by no means devoid of humanity, as he was &s;o much af|fected by this behaviour, that he promi&s;ed he would ne|ver be guilty of the like again; and though under no ac|tual obligation, promi&s;ed, and really effected, her hu&s;|band's liberty in the cour&s;e of three weeks: however he had not quite relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ire for the wife, nor for|got his defeat &s;ome months after the relea&s;e of her hu&s;|band,
<PB N="34" REF="033585_0033_0FF78FC4D3C0E668">
as he &s;ent for her to inform her, he would &s;end him for a &s;oldier, for not keeping up his payments to him. But, though he thus di&s;graced his former liberality, he never put tho&s;e threats in execution.</P>
<P>Thomas Speed, a mal&s;ter, of Harlow, &s;aid, that walk|ing one day in Harlow church-yard with Mr. Altham, by his de&s;ire, he began a&s;king him whether he had heard any thing of Ann Saunders's affair. Altham then told him, that he certainly had lain with her, and that &s;he was very willing he &s;hould. Well, &s;aid the other, and I heard that you found her a maid: 'No, by G&mdash;d,' replied Al|tham, &s;he was 'as open as that pond,' pointing to a pond ju&s;t by. And upon Speed's mentioning, that he thought this conduct very unbecoming in a man of his cloth, he &s;aid, in an&s;wer to it, that he was a man of a very vigorous and warm con&s;titution; and that he had lain with a wo|man five times within an hour and a half.&mdash;He then went on and told him, that a certain lady not an hundred miles off, had been familiar with him; and that if di&s;covered, it would cau&s;e a &s;eparation between her and her hu&s;band. This lady, the witne&s;s thought to be Mrs. Wenham. Mr. Altham told Speed, that he had not that experience in women that he had; as there was hardly three in the pari&s;h but would whore, if they were clo&s;ely followed.</P>
<P>Mary Special depo&s;ed, that as Mr. Wenham and his wife, a Mi&s;s Nichol&s;on and her&s;elf, were going to Hatfield fair, Mr. Wenham had dropped their company to &s;peak to Mr. Altham, whom he &s;aw in Hatfield church-yard; and that as &s;oon as Mrs. Wenham heard his voice, &s;he immediately went up to them, and in the hearing of all the company, &s;aid to the Rev. James Altham, "Sir, will you &s;ay that I ki&s;&s;ed you, and called you my dear Jemmy?" and that he then made an&s;wer that he would &s;ay it; on which Mrs. Wenham gave him &s;everal blow a upon the face with all her might; to which he made no manner of re&s;i&s;tance, but only exclaimed, See! &s;ee how I am u&s;ed.&mdash;However he per&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="35" REF="033585_0034_0FF78FC91FAF5018">
he would &s;ay it again, and even take 'his &s;acrament upon it. Mr. Altham's prote&s;tations, notwith&s;tand|ing, were totally void of foundation: and only add another melancholy in&s;tance of the force of malig|nant di&s;appointment, and exce&s;&s;es, the fatal effects of tho&s;e &s;ituations, which people bring them&s;elves into, by giving up the reins of rea&s;on to lu&s;t and &s;en&s;uality.</P>
<P>Mary Church, wife of John Church, farmer, of Matching, &s;poke the mo&s;t in favour of Mr. Altham's in&s;anity; and &s;aid, that a &s;ong was handed about Harlow fair made again&s;t him; that he had often complained to her about it, and was very often much agitated in con&s;equence of this &s;ong. This, it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, is a new argument, which proves, that there is hardly any depravity &s;o complete, as to be in&s;en&s;ible to ridicule, what|ever may be the vehicle by which it is conveyed.</P>
<P>Among other in&s;tances of eccentricity in Mr. Altham, Mrs. Church mentioned, that he once cal|led at her gate, where he kept talking and rambling from one &s;ubject to another, for two hours toge|ther: he then mentioned, that he had had a thought of making away with him&s;elf; but that he thanked God that he had prevented him. That he likewi&s;e cried very much; and &s;aid, he had done a thing by which he had di&s;honoured Mrs. Altham and him&s;elf very much; but that he had prayed to God, and God had forgiven him: and then added, I know he has forgiven me; and how do you think that I know it? I have lately had a large &s;um of money left me; and do you think that would have hap|pened if God had not forgiven me?</P>
<P>In treating of the &s;ong, we neglected to &s;ay that it had a picture at the head of it with three faces, and that its title was, "The wicked Vicar of E&s;&s;ex:" the author was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Mr. Whitnell, a clerk to John Wenham, E&s;q. at his office in the city.</P>
<P>W. Cotterell, of Man&s;ion hou&s;e-&s;treet, London,
<PB N="36" REF="033585_0035_0FF78FCBCD3D7B08">
depo&s;ed, that one Saturday afternoon, Mr. Altham called at his hou&s;e, on his coming to town to do du|ty at his church the next day; but did not then &s;tay two minutes, appearing, as he had done at other times, in a violent hurry and bu&s;tle, &s;aying he had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do. That between nine and ten at night, he returned very unexpectedly laughing and rubbing his hands, and &s;aid, he was come to &s;up with him, being the only time he ever &s;upped with him in his life; and then added, laugh|ing I know how you trade&s;men live and would not put you out of your way and have therefore brought my &s;upper in my pocket; at the &s;ame time &s;hewing two goo&s;berry tarts he had in his pocket. Mr. Cotterell was much &s;urpri&s;ed at his di&s;cour&s;e and manner; but neverthele&s;s, making an apology for taking him up two pair of &s;tairs, his hou&s;e be|ing then repairing, he introduced him to his wife, whom he had never &s;een before. That he then began laughing again, and &s;aying what he had brought in his pocket for his &s;upper; upon which Mrs. Cotterell ob&s;erved, &s;he was &s;orry he had given him&s;elf that trouble, for they had a goo&s;berry-pye in the hou&s;e, which was accordingly brought upon the table. Mr. Altham declared he was uncom|monly glad of it, being remarkably fond of goo&s;ber|ry-pye, and &s;at down to partake of it; but &s;oon after calling to their maid-&s;ervant, who was wait|ing, &s;aid to her in the mo&s;t &s;trange way, Poll come, hither, my dear? Don't be afraid, child, I won't bite you. Do you love goo&s;bery-pye? He then took the two tarts out of his pocket, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the maid taking them immediately into the kitchen, and eating them for her &s;upper. That, in order to humour him, the &s;ervant was obliged to take the tarts into the kitchen; but returning to wait at ta|ble &s;ooner then he imagined &s;he could have eaten them, he would not be &s;atisfied till &s;he went back a|gain, and ate the tarts. He then began to talk with
<PB N="37" REF="033585_0036_0FF78FCD7199D488">
Mrs. Cotterell, about his having a maid or two in the country, and he liked to make them a pre&s;ent now and then, and he bought a net-hood for one of them, which he would &s;hew to Mrs. Cotterell; and accordingly took it out of his pocket, &s;aying, the girls in that country wore tho&s;e kind of things, and they were very becoming, and he thought it would be a very pretty pre&s;ent for his maid. Then hold|ing it a little time in his hand, he told Mrs. Cotterell &s;he &s;hould &s;ee how he looked in it, and thereupon put it on his own head, and tied it under his chin; and in that manner jumped and &s;kiped about the room in it in the mo&s;t antic mannner, now and then looking into the gla&s;s, and a&s;king Mrs. Cotte|rell how it became him, and whether &s;he ever &s;aw a par&s;on in a net-hood before; and other expre&s;&s;i|ons in the &s;ame &s;trange kind of way.</P>
<P>After running on in this manner for &s;ome time, and having drank a gla&s;s of wine, he jumped up, and &s;aid he mu&s;t go to his inn, or he &s;hould be locked out, and accordingly between ten and eleven he went away, de&s;iring Mr. Cotterell to come to his church the next day. They went as de&s;ired, but Mr. Altham was not, at mo&s;t, more than ten mi|nutes in the pulpit, and the whole congregation appeared in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at the extreme &s;hortne&s;s of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the abruptne&s;s of his conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>After church, Mr. Cotterell and his wife went home, and were &s;carcely got into the hou&s;e, when Mr. Altham followed them there, and &s;aid laugh|ing, "Egad, I have given them a bobtail; now I'll go to Woodford, and get a dinner at Keepe's for nothing (meaning a gentleman of his acquaintance there) and a good feed for my hor&s;e, and be at home in a chevy:" at the &s;ame time jumping about, and acting with his arms as if riding expeditiou&s;ly, he went away apparently in a violent hurry.</P>
<P>Hugh Tarling a bricklayer, of Harlow, &s;aid, that when he was building a wall at Harlow, Mr.
<PB N="38" REF="033585_0037_0FF78FCF0D5D8A10">
Altham u&s;ed to be with them frequently, running on, and talking in the mo&s;t free and familiar man|ner, as if they were his equals, and would hand bricks to them; and one time would in&s;i&s;t on laying a brick him&s;elf, and then bragged how well he did it, and how clever he was, and could even &s;ift cin|ders, or turn his hand to any thing, and that noth|ing came ami&s;s to him. That &s;ome time, in the middle of his employment with the bricklayer, he would &s;uddenly, and abruptly &s;et off, and run home|wards as hard as he could drive, and after being gone perhaps twenty minutes or &s;o, run back again in the &s;ame manner, and quite out of breath. That one morning he came, about four o,clock, and knocked him up, &s;aying, he mu&s;t and would &s;ee him directly, and made a fre&s;h noi&s;e at the door. That he then had his night-cap on, and his &s;word-cane in his hand; and upon Tarling's going down to him, he found his bu&s;ine&s;s was, to in&s;i&s;t upon his taking a little fence down, which jutted a litle into the road, and run on a great deal about his being a magi&s;trate, and he would have it done; and if he would not do it, he would be the ruin of him, and &s;o on. That after, he told him to get his hat, and go with him, which he accordingly did; and in their way, &s;topt ju&s;t by a pond in the road, and began talking about the pre&s;byterians, and Mr. Wenham in particular; and complained how they per&s;ecuted him, and that they wanted to be the ruin of him, although he wanted to be at peace with them and every body, and a deal to that effect; and at la&s;t worked him&s;elf up to &s;uch an agony, as to talk of throwing him&s;elf into the pond to drown him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Altham, at other times in his flighty fits would talk of the di&s;&s;enters, and of Mr. Wenham in particular, in terms of great anger and re&s;entment, &s;aying, he would fight him or any man with &s;word pi&s;tol or fi&s;t, and would often run on a great deal in a wild and unconnected way, about his fighting
<PB N="39" REF="033585_0038_0FF78FD4B68C89E0">
and running; as that he could fight or run with any man in England: he would then jump and &s;kip about in a very antic manner, and run and put him&s;elf into fighting attitudes, by way of di&s;playing his &s;kill and cleverne&s;s in what he was talking about; he was then very apt to &s;wear much, which he was never guilty of before. And when he u&s;ed to talk of the di&s;&s;enters per&s;ecuting and tormenting him, he would bur&s;t into tears; and u&s;ed to harp much upon Mr. Parkhur&s;t, his father in law, and Mrs. Al|tham; and what a good and excellent man Mr. Park|hur&s;t was, and that their was not &s;uch a per&s;on in the world; and as for Mrs. Altham, there was not &s;uch a woman in a thou&s;and; and if it was not for them, he did not know what would become of him. And this &s;trange and unaccountable conduct, in talking and behaviour, happened, as Tarling thought, all or mo&s;tly in the &s;ummer and autumn of the year 1779.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Mrs. Wenham he &s;aid, that finding Mr. Altham at Mr. Legas's the apothecary, he began talking a great deal about that lady, and how &s;he had met him the day before at Hatfield fair, and had beat him mo&s;t cur&s;edly, and very near knocked him down, and then damned him and &s;aid, "What do you &s;ay now, you dog?" Upon which he replied, "Madam, what I have &s;aid I &s;till per&s;i&s;t in." Mrs. Wenham then &s;pitting in her hand, and clench|ing her fi&s;t, attacked him again, and repeated her blows &s;everal times. Upon Tarling a&s;king him what it was for, he replied nothing, but becau&s;e he had &s;aid &s;he had put her arms round his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him; and he then added, "By God, Tarling, &s;he did in this very entry; and to tell you the truth, I believe what &s;he wanted me to do was to r...r her. As to her, &s;he was a woman, and therefore I &s;corn|ed to &s;trike her again; but by God, if it had been that potgutted &s;on of a bitch, Wenham, damn him, I'd have broke every bone in his &s;kin." That he then began to put him&s;elf into fighting po&s;tures,
<PB N="40" REF="033585_0039_0FF78FD6532E52F8">
and to talk and run on about his fighting; and how much money he had given to learn to fight, and of the &s;trength of his arm, and that he was a very devil at fighting, and was able to fight any man in England, and a great deal to that effect; after which changing the &s;ubject, he run on a great deal about his prowe&s;s among the women, and that if it was not on Mrs. Altham's account, who was one of the be&s;t women in England, he could do any thng he plea&s;ed among the women, and &s;wore, that if he plea&s;ed, 'he could r...r fifty or a hundred of them in a night,' and more to that effect: by every part of his conduct and di&s;cour&s;e on that occa&s;ion, Tar|ling was convinced he was then ab&s;olutely in&s;ane, and incapable of con&s;idering or reflecting on what he &s;aid or did.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Legas, of Harlow, &s;aid, that as he was riding by Mr. Altham's hou&s;e, in company with Wenham, Mr. Altham being in his garden, called out to Mr. Wenham for his Ea&s;ter offering; upon which Mr. Wenham &s;topped and gave him five &s;hil|lings; that Mr. Altham appeared much offended, and a&s;ked Mr. Wenham what he meant by offering him &s;uch a &s;um, and whether it was not meant for the clerk and not for him, and that he never took le&s;s than a guinea of a gentleman; and, upon Mr. Wenham's &s;aying, he intended it for him, he flew into a mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, and, his rage getting the better of his rea&s;on, railed at and abu&s;ed Mr. Wen|ham in particular, and the di&s;&s;enters in general, ve|ry much; &s;wearing violently, and at length &s;trip|ping off his coat, and calling Mr. Wenham a &s;coun|drel and a coward, and other names of that &s;ort, challenged him to come down and fight him, and by &s;uch violent behaviour, a number of people were gathered round them. Mr. Legas afterwards rode on with Mr. Wenham, who was much offen|ded at Mr. Altham; and called him a ra&s;cal and a &s;coundrel, and &s;aid he would bring an action again&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="033585_0040_0FF78FD7EA863330">
him, for &s;topping and a&s;&s;aulting him in the high|way; adding, that the fellow was crazy, and be|haved like a madman, and other expre&s;&s;ions of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>He al&s;o boa&s;ted to Mr. Legas, what a great dan|cer he was; and at other times has told him, that if he had been bred to the navy, he was the only per&s;on in the world for the king to have &s;ent out to &s;ight Paul Jones, and if he had, he would have taken him at any rate. That on tho&s;e occa&s;ions he would always jump and &s;kip about, and act the part he was talking of performing. That at tho&s;e very early and un&s;ea&s;onable hours in the morning, he &s;ometimes in&s;i&s;ted upon his going home with him to breakfa&s;t, and would make his &s;ervants get up and get breakfa&s;t, and after breakfa&s;t he would go to bed again.</P>
<P>One morning in particular, as he was jumping and &s;kipping about the chairs, and bragging of his activity, he happened to &s;ee Hugh Tarling, the bricklayer at Harlow, coming towards his hou&s;e; he threw up the &s;a&s;h, and called him in, when he ran on a great deal about Mrs. Wenham, that &s;he was very fond of him, and vexed that he would not lay with her; adding, that he was the only man that was fit for her, as that fat-gutted fellow Wenham, could not half do her bu&s;ine&s;s; and then turning to Tarling, and catching him by the coat, &s;aid, Why, Tarling, it is nothing at all to me, I make nothing of it, I could lay with a hundred women in a night, I could, indeed, Tarling, and make nothing of it.</P>
<P>But with all this eccentricity, Mr. Altham had his fits of piety; he would often deplore Mr. Wen|ham's defection from the Church of England; would even cry, and fall upon his knees, &s;aying, "if Wenham would but turn to his mother Church, I would die a martyr to my religion;" and had of|ten begged and entreated the witne&s;s to go to Mr.
<PB N="42" REF="033585_0041_0FF78FD9A450D060">
Wenham from him, and endeavour to prevail on him to return to the church, which, to humour and pacify him, the other told him he would do, but never with any intention of doing it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time Mr. Altham &s;aw Dr. Monro, he &s;aid he would &s;hew him a trick by way of di&s;play|ing his activity, which perhaps he had never &s;een before; then placing his hat on the ground, and taking up one leg in one hand, and pulling the other hand over his head, in that maner he hopped &s;everal times round the hat, and then &s;tooped and picked it up in his mouth, without altering the po&s;ition of his hands, or letting go his leg.&mdash;Very con&s;i&s;tent indeed, with the dignity of the &s;acred function!</P>
<P>And by the depo&s;ition of Robert Ma&s;ter, it would &s;eem, that Mr. Altham, with his other fervours, had &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m, for be|ing once at dinner with the Rev. Robert Fowler, at Harlow, he broke out in a poetical rhap&s;ody on his favourite dog Zelio, declaring, that the&s;e ver|&s;es were the only lines he ever wrote, and that they were the effect of in&s;piration!</P>
<P>Such was the aggregate of the evidence adduced upon a trial, which, for a variety of &s;ituation, cir|cum&s;tance and character, has never been exceed|ed.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that there was any other in|&s;anity in this ca&s;e, than the almo&s;t uncontrouled dominion of violent pa&s;&s;ions, over a mind warped, but by no means devoid of &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;There was by far, too much method in the&s;e proceedings for &s;heer madne&s;s; yet, if any per&s;on would heap a greater degree of criminality upon Mr. Altham, than upon another per&s;on, an account of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion as a clergyman, it would be very unju&s;t, and unphilo&s;ophical. Nature is &s;uperior to every re|ligious form or in&s;titution in the world; and what|ever may be taught to the contrary, there is &s;carce|ly

any virtue or &s;anctity una&s;&s;i&s;ted by the tempera|ment and con&s;titution of the body: the&s;e, it is cer|tain, are the &s;tronge&s;t influencers of virtue and good order, as that una&s;&s;i&s;ted religion, and education are the weake&s;t: hence it is a lamentable truth, that, in Popi&s;h countries e&s;pecially, the crimes and enor|mities of &s;ome of the clergy, have only been ren|dered the more violent by re&s;traint.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Er&s;kine to the Jury.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I am coun&s;el for the plaintiff, Mr. Campbell; and although I feel on this occa&s;ion for the unfortunate &s;ituation of my client, which my duty in this place naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to my mind&mdash;yet, if I could have di&s;charged from my mind the painful &s;en&s;ations I feel at this time, by this cau&s;e being po&s;tponed or entirely put an end to, I &s;hould have derived par|ticular &s;atisfaction as far as it regards my&s;elf: for I do not know any &s;ituation more unplea&s;ant, than when it falls to the lot of an advocate to &s;tate tran&s;|actions which bring a reproach upon human nature it&s;elf. If I prove what is &s;tated to me, it mu&s;t &s;trike at all the confidences and con&s;olations of the human mind.</P>
<P>The defendant, who is charged with criminal conver&s;ation with the wife of the plaintiff, is the uncle of that unfortunate lady&mdash;not an uncle by marriage, but her mother's brother. That, I dare &s;ay is &s;ufficient to engage your indignant attention in this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, as I under&s;tand the adultery, the in|ce&s;tuous adultery is to be denied, and in&s;i&s;ted upon as the principal part of the defence; I have not the lea&s;t difficulty in &s;tating to my learned friend, that it will be abundantly e&s;tabli&s;hed in proof: but although I &s;hall make out to your perfect &s;atisfaction, that in point of fact the adultery has been committed, I &s;hall not wa&s;te your time in making any ob&s;ervations on the nature of &s;uch a ca&s;e. All that I &s;hall do at pre&s;ent, is to &s;tate tho&s;e circum&s;tances which may be nece&s;&s;ary to be known, in order to enable you to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>As to the plaintiff, he is a captain of the 74th regi|ment, and was married to his pre&s;ent wife in 1786. She was bred up in the Roman Catholic religion, and was the daughter of a Colonel Frazer, who was in the &s;ervice
<PB N="45" REF="033585_0044_0FF78FE28BECDF28">
of the Ea&s;t-India Company. This lady was religiou&s;ly educated, and brought up in the &s;tricte&s;t morals, although &s;he has not been proof again&s;t the &s;eduction of the de|fendant. In the year 1788, the plaintiff &s;ettled his af|fairs in this country, and was preparing to go to India, and it was then under&s;tood that Mrs. Campbell intended to accompany him. At the time that Captain Camp|bell was preparing to embark for India, the defendant, who is a Major in the Ea&s;t-India &s;ervice, came back to this country with a con&s;iderable fortune, and found his own niece (Mrs Campbell) under the protection of her mother, Mrs. Frazer, the pre&s;ent plaintiff being ab&s;ent. One is &s;orry to lay any charge to any individual, I am &s;orry to be obliged profe&s;&s;ionally to lay a charge to any gentleman, and much more &s;o, when it is a charge on human nature, which we all wear and carry about us. Yet I am afraid the evidence in this cau&s;e obliges me to &s;tate, from the moment the defendant returned into Englan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he had conceived the diabolical purpo&s;e of de|bauching her affections from her hu&s;band, with a view to that criminal intercour&s;e. So early did the plan of &s;e|duction on the part of the defendant commence, that the hu&s;band found, before Major Hook had been three weeks in England, a difference in the &s;tile of the letters which he received from his wife.&mdash;She then began to &s;ugge&s;t ob&s;tacles to her going to the Ea&s;t-Indies. There was &s;omething fretful and peculiar in her corre&s;pondence, and he found at la&s;t, without any thing that &s;ugge&s;ted to his mind any criminal intercour&s;e, (for how could he po&s;|&s;ibly entertain &s;uch an idea) but he had occa&s;ion to &s;ee that &s;he was con&s;iderably under the influence of the de|fendant. And Major Hook was propo&s;ing to take a journey to Scotland, to &s;ettle a difference which had ta|ken place between him and the plaintiff&mdash;not on the idea, you may be &s;ure, of any criminal intercour&s;e be|tween him and the daughter of his own &s;i&s;ter, but a dif|ference had taken place, becau&s;e the defendant had pre|&s;umed to give his advice with regard to certain matters, and which was contrary to the inclination of Captain
<PB N="46" REF="033585_0045_0FF78FE434BA2370">
Campbell, The defendant had the art to procure the father of Captain Campbell, to in&s;i&s;t upon his &s;on's leav|ing Mrs. Campbell behind him, and the defendant was to be a &s;ort of guardian to her in her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The plaintiff and his father were at variance, and the de|fendant kept the coals alive.&mdash;The defendant went down to Scotland and caried this lady with him: pretending to the plaintiff's father that there were great quarrels between her and her hu&s;band, and that it would be infinitely bet|ter that &s;he &s;hould remain with her mother, than ac|company Capt. Campbell to the Ea&s;t-Indies. All this time the defendant was carrying on a plan of criminal &s;e|duction, which ultimately gave ri&s;e to this action.&mdash;The defendant gained his purpo&s;e, becau&s;e, for &s;ome time his niece remained under the care of her mother. The hu&s;|band went to the Ea&s;t-Indies; and the uncle pretended to live with Mrs. Campbell as a parent, at the moment they were carrying on this adulterous commerce.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is a very material part of this ca&s;e to &s;tate that before the defendant had been three weeks in England, he carried this lady to Scotland, under pre|tence of carrying her to the plaintiff's father to reconcile her and his &s;on. I &s;hall prove the defendant in &s;uch a &s;ituation with her, and although I do not believe that the adultery was then committed, in that they had that crimi|nal intercour&s;e which mu&s;t be the foundation of this action, yet it will be &s;ufficient to convince you he had ca&s;t his eye upon her at that time, and therefore to that, all that happened afterwards mu&s;t be refered. This was about three or four weeks after the defendant returned to Eng|land, and when the plaintiff was in barracks. It was at that time Captain Campbell &s;aw his wife's affec|tions alienated from him. It was at that time he com|plained of the uncle giving her fine cloaths. Though he only con&s;idered this as proceeding from the kind di&s;po|&s;itions of an affectionate parent, it was productive of ex|tremely bad con&s;equences to him. So far was the de|fendant from imagining that ince&s;tuous commerce, that my learned friends come here boldly to maintain their
<PB N="47" REF="033585_0046_0FF78FE705E7F298">
client is ab&s;olutely innocent, not only of the commerce, but that his mind or immagination never &s;ugge&s;ted &s;uch an idea to him. That, therefore, is the nature of the de|fence, that this ince&s;tuous commerce never &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to the imagination of the defendant, and that he is perfectly innocent.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty, Gentlemen, Capt. Campbell could be made believe it, when he heard it the fir&s;t time in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and immediately came home in con|&s;equence of the report. I am extremely glad, gentlemen, the cau&s;e has not gone off. I under&s;tand I have now the witne&s;&s;es in Court. They will be called, and they are many in number, I &s;hall prove fir&s;t of all, that they were found in &s;ituations at Ram&s;gate, three weeks after his arrival, &s;hameful and &s;candalous to relate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall prove afterwards that they were &s;een almo&s;t in the very act of adultery, and that repeatedly; and if that is not proof &s;ufficient, where &s;hall we find it? I &s;hall prove it was his con&s;tant habit to &s;leep with her every night in the &s;ame bed, the whole of the night.</P>
<P>It is to be repre&s;ented, I under&s;tand, that my witne&s;&s;es come here to mi&s;repre&s;ent the&s;e facts. They are uncon|nected with one another, they lived in the hou&s;e with Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell at different times. They are per&s;ons over whom my client has no manner of influence, and therefore, unle&s;s you believe them corrupted with money, to come here to perjure them|&s;elves in the face of God and man, to fa&s;ten an im|putation on a man whom they believe to be innocent, you cannot refu&s;e to find that fact, which is the foundation of this action.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no farther ob&s;ervations on this ca&s;e. It is of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature; like every other ca&s;e, it mu&s;t depend on the complexion that belongs to it when you have heard both &s;ides.</P>
<P>I &s;hall lay &s;uch a ca&s;e before you as I have &s;tated; my learned friend will then be heard on the other &s;ide; and happy &s;hall I be if his client is not guilty; for every man mu&s;t wi&s;h &s;uch a ca&s;e was not proved. The evidence
<PB N="48" REF="033585_0047_0FF78FEB4AE667C0">
is of the &s;tronge&s;t kind of any &s;ort I ever received to urge on your attention.</P>

<P>Mr. Cleeve, who was examined by Mr. Mingay, proved, that he married the parties on February the 17th. 1786; he &s;aid &s;he was a Mi&s;s Frazer, the daughter of Mr. Colonel Frazer. Her father was in India. He al&s;o &s;tated, that the plaintiff and the defendant are cou&s;ins? And that the lady, when married, was &s;eventeen or eigh|teen.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell, fir&s;t cou&s;in to the defendant, and bro|ther to the plaintiff, being examined by Mr. Holroyd, and cro&s;s-examined by Mr. Bearcroft, &s;aid, that he went to France with Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, in 1787, &s;oon after their marriage; in company with his own wife, and Mrs. Frazer, the mother of Mrs. Campbell. He liv|ed under the &s;ame roof with them about two months, and never ob&s;erved any thing but the greate&s;t harmony between the bride and bridegroom.</P>
<P>Mr. Bearcroft was very particular in que&s;tioning this witne&s;s, as to the behaviour of the plaintiff towards his wife: but nothing could be di&s;covered that was not con|&s;i&s;tent with the duty of a tender and affectionate hu&s;band &mdash;nothing that could ju&s;tify&mdash;or even apoligize&mdash;for the depraved conduct of the lady. He proved, that a bundle of papers which were &s;hewn him, was the hand|writing of Mr. Campbell. He knew the lady before &s;he was married; and, as &s;he was only, he &s;aid, 15 or 16, he had no doubt, from that and other circum&s;tances, but it was a match of pure inclination.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Hender&s;on was next examined by Mr. Holroyd: this witne&s;s lived as cook with Mrs. Frazer, in 1788; in which year, in the month of July, the fami|ly went to Ram&s;gate. In a &s;hort time afterwards, they were joined by Major Hook, Mr. Campbell being then either at Chatham or Port&s;mouth. Their &s;tay at this place was about ten weeks.</P>

parlour one day, with a bit of bread to the Major and Mrs. Campbell, &s;aid the witne&s;s, I &s;aw the Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r one hand round her neck, and his legs upon her lap.&mdash;Did you ob&s;erve any thing with re&s;pect to her hair? Her hair, replied Mrs. Elizabeth, was rolled round his left arm, and his right-hand was in the handkerchief that co|vered her neck.&mdash;This witne&s;s further &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that when the Major fir&s;t arrived at Ram&s;gate, Mrs. Campbell was very much alarmed, and fainted away at his coming in.&mdash;This circum&s;tance aro&s;e, no doubt, from the &s;udden remor&s;e of a troubled con&s;cience, which at the be&s;t of times, certain|ly could never be at re&s;t. If &s;he felt &s;o much at the &s;ight of her uncle, who was a <HI>partner</HI> in her guilt, how much in truth, ought &s;he to have been afflicted at the &s;ight of her hu&s;band! who, according to all the evidence, treated her in the mo&s;t tender manner.</P>
<P>In September the family again came to town, Mrs. Frazer and Mrs. Campbell going to their hou&s;e in Brook|&s;treet, and Major Hook to his own.</P>
<P>Jo&s;eph Rippington was next examined by Mr. Er&s;kine. He was hired by Major Hook as his valet, in May 1789, at which time the Major was at the Bath hotel, cohabit|ing with his niece. After living here about three weeks, they removed to Sackville-&s;treet, where they continued about two months. At this time, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the lady had made her uncle as happy as this kind of connexion could make him; and yet is this witne&s;s &s;ent to &s;cour the &s;treets of London, to procure ob&s;cene prints, which the Major &s;aid he wanted to &s;end to India but, as will be pre&s;ently &s;een, for quite a different pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Did you buy the&s;e prints, a&s;ked Mr. Er&s;kine? I bought &s;ome. I have &s;ome of them here in my pocket of the &s;ame nature. Now, Sir, did you ever &s;ee any of the&s;e prints in the Major's hand?&mdash;Yes, I did. I went into the room one day&mdash;But did they expect you, when you went in? No, Sir, they did not, an&s;wered the valet. You went into the room when he did not expect you with a me&s;&s;age; what did you then &s;ee? Why, Sir, he
<PB N="50" REF="033585_0050_0FF78FF2F1285DA8">
had got one of the prints, I had purcha&s;ed for him, in his hand, and &s;he was looking over his &s;houlder at it. When I came in, &s;he turned her head away, and walked to the window.</P>
<P>The examination of this witne&s;s clo&s;ed, by his de&s;crib|ing &s;ome particulars of a journey through South Wales undertaken by the Major and Mrs. Campbell, no other &s;ervant being with them except this valet. The Major, &s;aid he, would not take any lodging at any inn, unle&s;s there were rooms adjoining, and a middle door leading from the one room into the other.</P>
<P>Robert Green, examined by Mr. Mingay, lived with Major Hook, in the year 1790, when Captain Campbell was abroad. He refided then in Duke-&s;treet, Manche&s;|ter-&s;quare. When I had been in Major Hook's &s;ervice about &s;ix weeks, &s;aid he, though before that I had &s;u|&s;picions from what I had &s;een, I thought there was &s;ome|thing going on that was improper betwen the uncle and his niece. One day, after dinner, more from curio&s;ity than any thing el&s;e, I went up into the drawing-room, and I perceived Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell &s;itting on the couch which &s;tood behind the door, in a very tender way, with one arm round Mrs. Campbell's neck, and the other up her petticoats. I plainly perceived Mrs. Campbell's naked thigh.</P>
<P>How fickle and incon&s;tant is fortune! As a further proof it, we here ob&s;erve Major Hook at the very <HI>&s;um|mit</HI> of &s;en&s;ual felicity, and in the next paragraph be|hold him in as critical and mortifying a &s;ituation as a gentleman could well be placed in: di&s;appointment, chagrin, remor&s;e, nay, almo&s;t madne&s;s, conflicting in the bo&s;om of a beautiful young lady, while with a fatal weapon in her hand, &s;he was &s;eeking for <HI>revenge</HI> on him! It is not for us to &s;ay the fir&s;t cau&s;e of this undo|ing; but it &s;eems to be certain, from this outrageous conduct of Mrs. Campbell, that &s;he would, if po&s;&s;ible, have retrieved her honour, by &s;acrificing her uncle.</P>
<P>One day after this, continued the witne&s;s, Major Hook &s;aid to Mrs. Campbell, I am going out, and
<PB N="51" REF="033585_0051_0FF78FF5AF0CB550">
&s;hall be in at dinner, (the dinner was a cod's head and &s;houlder, and &s;auce); Major Hook did not come in, upon which Mrs. Campbell waited till &s;ix o'clock; &s;he &s;eemed to be in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and ordered me to take the dinner down, and &s;aid &s;he would not have any din|ner.</P>
<P>When the Major came home I let him in; it was a|bout half pa&s;t ten at night. He went into the drawing-room, after which I went down into the kitchen. After I had been there about a quarter of an hour, I heard a violent &s;cream and cry of murder. With that I went into the drawing-room, and perceived Major Hook &s;tanding in one corner of the room, with a chair before him, and Mrs. Campbell was trying to &s;trike him with a po|ker. With that he de&s;ired me to quit the room, which I did, and went down into the kitchen. After I had been there about ten minutes I heard a violent cry out again, and Mrs. Campbell ran down &s;tairs. This was a|bout half-pa&s;t eleven at night. She ran into the &s;treet; the Major followed her, and de&s;ired me to go after her, I overtook her &s;ome way down the &s;treet. Her hand|kerchief was all torn, and the Major's wai&s;tcoat was al&s;o very much torn. For God's &s;ake, Mrs. Campbell, &s;aid I, con&s;ider what you are about, con&s;ider what condition you are in. You will be &s;ent to the watch-hou&s;e. On this &s;he returned. She went into the parlour, and &s;hut her&s;elf up there. Major Hook &s;aid, Herriot, I in&s;i&s;t upon your coming out. She did come out, and ran up &s;tairs. Her foot &s;lipped, and &s;he either fainted or pre|tended to faint away.</P>
<P>The Major &s;tood over her, and when &s;he recovered, &s;aid, Ye wh&mdash;e! ye d&mdash;d wh&mdash;e: ye wor&s;t of wh&mdash;s! To which &s;he replied, I confe&s;s I am a wh&mdash;e, but I am a wh&mdash;e only to you. You, who ought to have been my protector, guardian, and friend, have been the utter ruin and de&s;truction of my&s;elf and family as long as I live.&mdash;Oh! my hu&s;band!</P>
<P>No feeling mind, whether that of male or female, can &s;carcely refrain from <HI>pitying</HI> Mrs. Campbell at this aw|ful
<PB N="52" REF="033585_0052_0FF78FF74D0363F0">
period of her amour; and though it is, perhaps, im|po&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould ever more regain a tranquil &s;tate of mind, &s;he may yet receive &s;ome con&s;olation in the almo&s;t certain hope, that the example of her fatal in|di&s;cretions will operate mo&s;t powerfully on the minds of every female yet untainted. While <HI>her</HI> &s;tory lives, and an uncle dares make the &s;malle&s;t criminal advance to his niece, we tru&s;t, that &s;he would &s;purn him from her with marked and inflexible indignation; that &s;he would not from delicacy, &s;pare the viper, but in&s;tantly hold him up to the execration of every one within the cir|cle of his acquaintance. Cuckoldom, in its be&s;t point of view, is a crime of no common magnitude; it is a &s;pecies of robbery that would di&s;grace a highwayman, for he boldly ventures his life: the &s;educer, who ven|tures nothing but his <HI>money,</HI> will &s;end your wife panting with pollution into your arms, when you take her joy|fully to your bo&s;om; but, if &s;he does not <HI>de&s;pi&s;e,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t certainly <HI>laugh</HI> at your raptures.</P>
<P>Do you recollect, proceeded the coun&s;el, at any time, when you lived with Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell, that you had the curio&s;ity to go into their bed-chamber to look at their bed? I do, replied the witne&s;s. A wo|man of the name of Betty White, who lived at No. 18, and who made the beds, &amp;c. u&s;ed to come down &s;tairs to me, and make me go up and look at Mrs. Campbell's bed. She &s;aid there had been more than one in bed: and I always &s;aw the marks of two</P>
<P>This witne&s;s confirmed what had been &s;aid before, of the mode of engaging rooms at the different inns on the road; and, in addition thereto, &s;aid, that one day after dinner, while at Swan&s;ea, he was with the children, Major Hook's &s;ons, when he perceived the Major and Mis. Campbell lying on the foot of the bed in her bed|room. Here the coun&s;el very properly a&s;ked, what po&s;|ture they were in? As &s;oon as the Major &s;aw me, I put him into a &s;urpri&s;e; he &s;tarted up, &s;aid the witne&s;s, and the flap of his breeches was turned down. His face was as red as fire at the &s;ame time he was lying in this
<PB N="53" REF="033585_0053_0FF78FF8EC1B3E98">
manner.&mdash;Did you ob&s;erve any part of Mrs. Campbell? Yes, Sir, I could &s;ee her thighs.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrow cro&s;s-examined the witne&s;s; and again adverted to the curio&s;ity of Betty White, who had invi|ted him to look at the bed after the Major and Mrs. Camp|bell had ri&s;en. He acknowledged having &s;een <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> el&s;e in the bed, be&s;ides the impre&s;&s;ion of two per|&s;ons; but, from delicacy, he did not point it out to Betty White, who was &s;tanding in another part of the room.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> rank in life mu&s;t commit crimes, at which ju&s;tice and decency revolts, how much is it to be regretted, that they are &s;o carele&s;s of its publi|city! Inferiors will, of cour&s;e, follow the pernicious ex|ample; and having their ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s to copy from, proceed &s;tep by &s;tep, till they imagine that to be meritorious, which is, in fact, di&s;graceful to human na|ture.</P>
<P>The wife of this la&s;t witne&s;s, al&s;o lived with Mrs. Campbell about &s;ix weeks; &s;he attended her to Swan|&s;ea; and gave &s;atisfactory information about the &s;itua|tion of the &s;leeping rooms. Major Hook had his three children with him; the elde&s;t of whom was eleven or twelve, the two others about two years of age, the&s;e children &s;lept in a room between tho&s;e of the Major and Mrs. Campbell: and &s;ometimes the elde&s;t &s;lept with his father. The door of her mi&s;tre&s;s's room, and the door of the children's room, were left open by her orders. The Major has frequently come in before &s;he left the room. Very often Major Hook, half undre&s;&s;ed, has come in|to Mrs. Campbell's room when &s;he was quite undre&s;&s;ed: but always withdrew when he &s;aw the witne&s;s</P>
<P>Elizabeth Hurn, Elizabath Taylor, James Wood|row, and William Lewis, all &s;aid, that the Major and Mrs. Campbell had been &s;een by them in loving, though not in criminal &s;ituations: they de&s;cribed &s;ome of the Major's nocturnal <HI>marches</HI> from his own chamber to that of his niece's.</P>
<P>Jean Grynds, examined by Mr. Er&s;kine, had lived in the &s;ervice of the defendant in 1792, as cook; at
<PB N="54" REF="033585_0054_0FF78FFE23928D58">
which time Mrs. Campbell lived with the Major. Du|ring that five months, tell us, &s;aid the coun&s;el, if you &s;aw any thing particular, and what? I &s;aw, an&s;wered the witne&s;s, Major Hook and Mrs. Campbell together in his room, I went into Mrs. Campbell's room, but &s;he was not there, and in coming by the Major's door, I found it was &s;hut: the Major's room was almo&s;t clo&s;e to her's. I had the curio&s;ity to look through the key-hole; when I &s;aw the Major lying along the foot of the bed &s;tark-naked as he could be; and Mrs Campbell &s;it|ting be&s;ide him on the bed, with her hand on his back. She, indeed, was dre&s;&s;ed, but the Major had no &s;hirt on at all. While I &s;tood there, Mrs. Campbell drew the curtains at the foot of the bed. When I could &s;ee no more, I in&s;tantly went down &s;tairs. The Major, previous to this, had been bathing.</P>
<P>It was admitted, in the cour&s;e of the evidence, that Captain Campbell went into barracks in 1788, &s;ailed January 26, 1789, for India: and returned in 1792.</P>
<P>Mr. Bearcroft's addre&s;s to the Jury on the part of Major Hook.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip:</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury,&mdash;The evidence which has been given on the part of the plaintiff in this cau&s;e, enti|tles me to your full and mo&s;t patient hearing. My title I put upon this circum&s;tance, that the ca&s;e as it now &s;tands, is of a nature and of a complexion that mu&s;t &s;trike every mind, as undoubtedly a very aggravated ca&s;e. And it is of con&s;equence, that every generous mind will allow this follows when &s;uch a ca&s;e is proved, that tho&s;e who are to decide upon it, &s;hall well view and con&s;ider it in order, that the judgment, which they ultimately give may be temperate and moderate; for, unle&s;s it be tempe|rate and moderate, it can never be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;hould not be entitled to a moment's at|tention from you, if I attempted to di&s;&s;emble the weight which I feel on my &s;houlders.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e which has been proved on the part of the plaintiff, has been &s;tated, and ju&s;tly &s;tated on this evi|dence
<PB N="55" REF="033585_0055_0FF78FFFB9837AF0">
in two very &s;trong words&mdash;a ca&s;e of Ince&s;tuous Adultery. I admit it. I allow that &s;uch a ca&s;e calls &s;eri|ou&s;ly on the feelings of tho&s;e who hear it, and of tho&s;e who are to determine; but it is my duty to remark to you, and it will be the principal part with which I &s;hall trouble you, to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ituation in which you &s;tand. You are not put there, nor does my Lord &s;it there, I am &s;ure he will tell you, to puni&s;h the defendant criminally, for any crime or any offence. Perhaps it might be thought an opprobrium to the common law of England, that it a&s;&s;erts no criminal juri&s;diction of &s;uch offences. But you will recollect there are particular ju|ri&s;dictions, and different di&s;po&s;itions of the power of pun|i&s;hment, and different courts of different juri&s;dictions. Becau&s;e the common law has no &s;uch juri&s;diction, let no per&s;on run away with the notion that &s;uch offences can|not be puni&s;hed in England. Puni&s;hed they are, and &s;e|riou&s;ly. But that juri&s;diction is in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and not in the courts of common law. I wi&s;h to remark to you, that there is another place where the criminal part of &s;uch kind of conduct is to be con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, my Lord will tell you, that the que&s;tion in this cau&s;e (I do not mean to trouble you with wit|ne&s;&s;es) for you to decide &s;imply, relates to damages: what &s;atisfaction you will give by your verdict to the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when I am endeavouring to guard again&s;t mixing and running together different juri&s;dictions, when I am attempting to &s;hew you that you ought not to blend the criminal juri&s;diction with the civil damages, you are to give to the party, I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood, as not to be contending by my defence, that you are to dive&s;t your&s;elves of the other parts of the ca&s;e. Take it as a matter of aggravation, but permit me to &s;ay, and I &s;ay it &s;ubject to the correction of the noble and learned Judge, that you ought not, that you have no power, in the &s;itu|ation in which you &s;tand, to give vindictive damages. Vengeance, puni&s;hment for crimes, belong to another
<PB N="56" REF="033585_0056_0FF790018CD02AA8">
juri&s;diction. You will take care in the verdict you &s;hall pronounce, that you will not by any means mix other juri&s;dictions, which you have no right to take any notice of, with the que&s;tion of damages which you are to give the party.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it was &s;tated to you in the out&s;et, that it was under&s;tood that the coun&s;el for the defendant, inten|ded to in&s;i&s;t upon the innocence of the defendant, and to impute to the plaintiff an attack of this kind by the means of perjury.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, no powers, no per&s;ua&s;ion, after the evi|dence that has been given to-day, &s;hould prevail on me to &s;tand up as coun&s;el for a party to attempt to do any thing of the kind. It never entered into the mind of the defendant to give any &s;uch in&s;tructions. It would have been gro&s;sly ab&s;urd &s;o to have done. It would have been an additional offence, I confe&s;s, on which to have founded an argument; for, I &s;hould then have thought it an additional offence, to endeavour to acquit the de|fendant by charging the plaintiff with a foul con&s;piracy, with the intent to bring &s;uch a ca&s;e as this again&s;t the de|fendant, and &s;upport it by a variety of &s;uborned witne&s;|&s;es. I di&s;claim any &s;uch idea. My client di&s;claims it.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury,&mdash;having &s;aid this, having marked this line, which &s;eparates trial, judgment, and puni&s;hment, from a que&s;tion or civil damages, I am un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of chiefly relying upon that ground.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, with re&s;pect to the damages, I have but few and very few ob&s;ervations to make. The plaintiff quitted his wife; the plaintiff went to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and left her here. It has been attempted to call a witne&s;s to prove, that he intended to carry her with him. As that is an ingredient for your con&s;ideration, I call upon you as a piece of ju&s;tice, which I am &s;ure you will not deny me, to take that as a fact which is not proved. I pre&s;s my ob&s;ervation farther. I &s;ay, I have a right I think to a&s;k you, and you will not refu&s;e it, to con&s;ider it as a clear fact, that Mr. Campbell did not mean to take his wife with him, but to leave her here.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="033585_0057_0FF790032A1DEBE0">Gentlemen, with re&s;pect to the manner in which the parties have lived together, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that there is not that full and &s;atisfactory proof that might be expected in a ca&s;e of this kind. Per&s;ons who are near relations to the plaintiff, and others, &s;eem to leave that liable to ob&s;ervation, and liable to &s;ome degree of &s;u&s;picion. But do not under&s;tand me to pre&s;s it farther than is proper. I admit there is &s;ome evidence of their living well together. And, perhaps, my Lord will tell you, when &s;ome evidence is given, and that evidence is not contradicted, it mu&s;t be taken that &s;uch per&s;ons lived well together. You mu&s;t take it &s;o.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, with re&s;pect to the damages you are to give to the plaintiff, there is another circum&s;tance, which Juries, during my experience in the profe&s;&s;ion, have al|ways attended to, and it is e&s;&s;ential that they &s;hould; I mean the Situation and Abilities of the party who is to make &s;atisfaction. My learned friend, who never forgets even in the out&s;et to &s;erve his client's ca&s;e, though &s;ome|times he re&s;erves his &s;tronge&s;t powers for a reply, told you, the defendant in this ca&s;e was a per&s;on who re&s;ided many years in India, and has returned to Europe with a great fortune: a de&s;cription that was proper for Lord Clive, Sir Francis Sykes, and many other per&s;ons, that we are in the habit of calling Nabobs. That de&s;cription however, very little &s;uits my client. Not a title of evi|dence has been given, not a que&s;tion was a&s;ked about his circum&s;tances, and my learned friend has fini&s;hed his ca&s;e. Now as to that, he is a Major, and has returned home with a few thou&s;ands in his pocket: a great part of it is gone, and he is about to return to his former &s;itu|ation in the army in the Ea&s;t-Indies. It is in evidence to you that he has three children. They can be guilty of nothing. The&s;e are the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e. In a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing damages again&s;t the father, as &s;ome of you probably are, I tru&s;t that is a circum&s;tance which you can never be prevailed upon totally to forget.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, with the&s;e con&s;iderations, therefore, I mu&s;t &s;urrender his ca&s;e to your temper and moderation.
<PB N="58" REF="033585_0058_0FF790065F4F7120">
I call no witne&s;&s;es for the rea&s;on I have &s;tated. You are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;e. You will recollect, as I have &s;aid, you are not trying this man for crimes and of|fences, but you are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the damages that &s;uch a per&s;on as this &s;hall pay to the plaintiff under all the cir|cum&s;tances that belong to this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the doctrine which I take the liberty of impre&s;&s;ing on your minds, is the doctrine of good &s;en&s;e, general ju&s;tice, and I take the liberty of &s;aying, that it is the peculiar doctrine of the law of England. I know per|fectly well it is &s;tated, by great authority, and we read in all books, that attention &s;hall be paid in the que&s;tion of damages; nay, even of criminal puni&s;hment and fine, to the abilites of the party. Nothing is proved on the part of the plaintiff but that this gentleman has re&s;ided &s;ome few years in India; and though a few return with great fortunes, others do not.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the&s;e are the ob&s;ervations, that under &s;uch a ca&s;e, I believe I have a right to make. I have been extremely diligent and careful not to make any impro|per ones. I hope and tru&s;t I have &s;ucceeded, becau&s;e mo&s;t undoubtedly, in a ca&s;e of this &s;ort, I am extremely anxious to defend my client.</P>
<P>I &s;urrender him, therefore, without farther ob&s;ervation on the ca&s;e, to your moderate and temperate ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Lord Kenyon's addre&s;s to the Gentlemen of the Jury.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;During the period of four or five years, it has been a painful part of my duty too often to a&s;&s;i&s;t Juries, as far as I am capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, in admini&s;tering ju&s;tice to the parties in cau&s;es of this kind. And if I could but promi&s;e my&s;elf that this were to be the la&s;t, that the reformation of the morals of the people might not be totally extingui&s;hed, to my mind it would admini&s;ter great comfort indeed; for I confe&s;s I never did hear cau&s;es of this kind, &s;erious cau&s;es of this kind, without feeling extremely for the di&s;tre&s;s of the party who has &s;uffered this injury, and who has been obliged to appeal to the laws of his country for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The manly, prudent, and di&s;creet manner in which the learned gentlemen who has ju&s;t &s;at down, has left
<PB N="59" REF="033585_0059_0FF7900AD16A05E8">
the ca&s;e of the defendant, has delivered me from the painful and odious ta&s;k of drudging through that horri|ble &s;tory, which has ju&s;t been detailed by the witne&s;&s;es who have been examined.</P>
<P>It has been admitted that the ca&s;e is proved, and there|fore the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict, and the &s;ole con&s;ideration is the quantum of the damages. You have been put in mind, and very properly, that this is a civil action, and that it is not a proceeding to puni&s;h the par|ty, as if he had been guilty of a breach of any criminal law of the country. But, gentlemen, when you are cal|led upon to proportion your damages to the injury the plaintiff has received, I hardly know how to mea&s;ure out that &s;atisfaction in pounds, &s;hillings, and pence.</P>
<P>There are certain ca&s;es where &s;ome other mode of proceeding is to be adopted; but this action is brought by a per&s;on of in&s;ulted honour, and to whom no dama|ges can be given adequate to the offence. The per&s;on who takes one's goods and chattles, is &s;aid to have taken that which has been &s;laves to thou&s;ands; but he that takes from another his good name, takes from him that which does not enrich him, but takes from the other that which makes him poor indeed.</P>
<P>Whether this action may not be re&s;embled to &s;ome|thing of the kind, it is for you to judge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall call back to you the outlines of the ca&s;e, that which the plaintiff has enjoyed, and that which he has lo&s;t: you were told, this was a match formed in con&s;e|quence of the mo&s;t ardent affections; that it was a love match, and as far as the &s;ituation in which they lived to|gether was di&s;clo&s;ed, they lived in the greate&s;t harmony and comfort till he went to India, and it was done away in the manner you have heard. But it is hinted rather than &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;omething wrong appeared in the plaintiff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s leaving his lady behind him.</P>
<P>What! has every young officer, who is called upon to di&s;charge his duty to his country, the means of carrying his family with him? How few per&s;ons are able to carry along with them all their comforts: and, if he was torn
<PB N="60" REF="033585_0060_0FF7900CABF74B78">
away from the&s;e comforts: and, if he was unfortunately torn away from the&s;e comforts here, is he to part with them for ever? Is there no hope he might be received into the arms of a wife whom he affectionately loved? Was he cautious and regardfull of her affection before he went abroad? Where could he have left her, except in the hou&s;e of her own mother? Had he not a right to ex|pect from the neare&s;t and deare&s;t calls of nature, that the uncle, the brother of her own mother, would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in protecting her, that wanted the immediate protection of her hu&s;band. But has &s;he received that protection? I have a right to appeal to part of the evi|dence&mdash;&s;he was a wh&mdash;e, a d&mdash;d wh&mdash;e, the wor&s;t of wh&mdash;es, &s;he replied, &s;he became a wh&mdash;e through his means: that &s;he was his only, and that he who ought to have been her father and her protector, had been the ruin of her and her family; alas! her poor hu&s;band!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, did &s;he fall an ea&s;y prey into the arms of this Ince&s;tuous Adulterer? As far as we are able to judge, all po&s;&s;ible means were fir&s;t u&s;ed to corrupt her mind, in order that afterwards he might debauch her body. Books to inflame her pa&s;&s;ions, prints mo&s;t in|decent to be exhibited by any body to any body, are exhibited by the uncle to his own neice, the wife of a|nother man.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is very true, in a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing damages of this kind, one would wi&s;h that they &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion to the circum&s;tances of the party who is to pay them. What his &s;ituation is I do not know, but this I do know, that poverty, abject poverty, is no an|&s;wer to a call of this kind; to a man injured to the extent this gentleman has been.</P>
<P>I can point out to you no rule but that which has been &s;ugge&s;ted certainly to con&s;ider it temperately, certain|ly to con&s;ider it moderately. But at what &s;um, temper and moderation, in a ca&s;e of this kind, ought to &s;top, it is for you to judge, and not for me to &s;ugge&s;t to you.</P>
<P>The Jury withdrew about half an hour to con&s;ider of their verdict, and afterwards found for the plaintiff damages,&mdash;Three Thou&s;and Pounds.</P>

<HEAD>The Trial of Robert Newberry, for a Rape on the body of Jane Skinner, a Child about the age of Ten years. At the A&s;&s;izes held at King&s;ton, in Surry; March, 1759.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES Brooks.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in the nature of a guar|dian over the infant Jane Skinner, who was then with her mother in Deadman's Place. On Monday October 16, the pri&s;oner came to me in London, to let me know the child was ill, and would not di&s;cover what was the matter with her, till her papa came, (&s;he meant me, whom &s;he u&s;ed to call &s;o.) When I came to her mo|ther, I a&s;ked her &s;ome que&s;tions, but &s;he told nothing. The grandfather of the child called me out, and &s;aid &s;he had got the running of the reins. The next morning I took her to Mr. Hammond's, a &s;urgeon and man-mid|wife; he would not examine the child without a woman; when the woman came, Mr. Hammond was gone out. Going back. I took the child into an apothecarey's &s;hop, told him &s;he was bad, and de&s;ired him to let me have &s;omething. I &s;aid to the child, Now, Jenny, I charge you to tell me what ails you; if nobody has meddeled with you, this will do you good: but if any boys have been rude with you, this will kill you. Then &s;he &s;aid, Bob Newberry had. The mother fainted away, and I was much confu&s;ed, I called in the pri&s;oner, and a&s;ked him what he had done to the child? Nothing, he &s;aid; and I took him into a room, unbuttoned his breeches, and his &s;hirt appeared in an uncommon way. I &s;ent for a &s;urgeon, who is here and de&s;ired him to &s;earch them both: he did, and &s;aid they were both foul: I took the pri&s;oner before Ju&s;tice Clark: there he owned that he got this di&s;ea&s;e by one Peg Mackinto&s;h, going to or

<P>I am a rug-maker: the pri&s;oner was my apprentice: at the time the fact was committed, I was next door at dinner, and had left the child in the care of the grandfather and pri&s;oner, About three or four days after that, I heard the child complain that &s;he could not make water: I &s;ent her &s;hift to a chyme&s;t, to de&s;ire to know what was the matter with her; he &s;aid &s;he was foul he gave me three do&s;es of phy&s;ic, which I gave her. The &s;urgeon that &s;earched her &s;aid &s;he was foul. When the pri&s;oner was taken up, he cried, and &s;aid he did it that day I dined at Mrs. Miller's. I &s;aid, When did you get this di&s;temper? he &s;aid, as he was going to Peckham Fair, and that one Peg Mackinto&s;h gave it him. I know no more of it.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Er&s;kine's Addre&s;s to the Jury.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am coun&s;el for the plaintiff, Mr. William Bro|mel, who is a &s;urgeon and apothecary in Newca&s;tle upon Tyne. The defendant, Sir M. W. Ridley, is a man of independent fortune in the neighbour|hood of that town, and repre&s;enting it in Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I am not in&s;tructed, nor is it, I a&s;&s;ure you, my inclination to go out of this ca&s;e to make any ob&s;ervations, much le&s;s to declaim on the de|fendant, on account of the unplea&s;ant nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s that brings us into a court of ju&s;tice. On the contrary, if I pur&s;ued my own inclinations, and my own inclinations are left perfectly free, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the defendant, in all other re&s;pects, is undoubtedly a man of character and honour; and
<PB N="66" REF="033585_0066_0FF7901A0FCA6390">
he is married to a lady (I do not &s;peak from in&s;truc|tion, but from my own per&s;onal knowledge of her for a great many years) of the mo&s;t amiable and plea&s;ant di&s;po&s;ition. This is therefore, undoubt|edly, an unfortunate cau&s;e for Sir Matthew White Ridley, even as it affects him in this re&s;pect. I have nothing to do with his &s;ufferings, but ought rather to turn my attention to the &s;ufferings which mu&s;t be felt much more on this occa&s;ion by my cli|ent.</P>
<P>Mr. Bromel had been married to this lady eight or ten years and had a child by her, a daughter. I am &s;orry to remark, that my experience on this &s;ubject is but too large, which ari&s;es from the de|pravity of the times in which we live.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pur&s;ue this cour&s;e. I &s;hall &s;imply &s;tate what I am afraid my witne&s;&s;es will prove, and &s;hall not give any glo&s;s or colour to the &s;ubject, nothing beyond that which I think properly belongs to it.</P>
<P>The wife of the plaintiff is a mo&s;t beautiful wo|man, and when &s;he was married to her hu&s;band, was extremely young; and whether from any le|vity in her behaviour which makes a woman an ob|ject of temptation and &s;u&s;picion, a report for &s;ome time prevailed to her prejudice at Newca&s;tle. As I under&s;tand re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es will &s;tate this is the fact, I therefore think it infinately better I &s;hould &s;tate it in the opening, le&s;t it might throw any prejudice on the cau&s;e, which, when it comes to be examined, will entitle me to call on the de|fendant for large damages in this ca&s;e,</P>
<P>It is extremely true, this unfortunate lady, from her own beauty and levity of behaviour, knew &s;he had &s;ubjected her&s;elf to &s;uch a report in a nar|row circle, in con&s;equence of &s;ome malignity which beautiful women are but too frequently the &s;ub|jects of. Undoubtedly &s;uch a report prevailed, and within the knowledge of my client. I need hardly &s;tate to you how much a hu&s;band mu&s;t feel on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="033585_0067_0FF7901F7471DB88">If I am broke in upon in the evidence which I &s;hall produce in &s;upport of the plaintiff's ca&s;e, I deliver up my client to be treated with all the contempt with which any man ought to be treated, if he was not watchful and properly jealous of the ho|nour of his wife; if he was inattentive to her, and winking at her notorious adultery; or putting her into the hands of another for &s;uch purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>This report blew over; for a &s;ea&s;on &s;he had lo&s;t the affections of her hu&s;band. A few more years had pa&s;&s;ed over their heads, and the plaintiff was living happily and comfortable with his wife, till his peace was broke in upon, and ruined for ever.</P>
<P>This cau&s;e was certainly not brought here for public example. I do not mean to in&s;i&s;t upon it that this is any &s;ort of per&s;ecution. I mean merely to &s;tate that this is the &s;ituation of an injured man &mdash;of an injured hu&s;band; and I think the injury &s;ufficiently great, without bringing in aid any cir|cum&s;tances that might tend to inflame the minds of you the jury.</P>
<P>Sir Matthew White Ridley was not only a mar|ried gentleman, but was chief magi&s;trate of New|ca&s;tle, at the time this injury was committed. He was al&s;o repre&s;entative of it in Parliament; and, gentlemen, you will con&s;ider how much he has di&s;graced all the&s;e &s;ituations, by de&s;cending to com|mit a crime which is now the &s;ubject of indignation.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand this defendant comes here with this double &s;ort of ca&s;e. In the&s;e cau&s;es, what is to be contended on the other &s;ide is pretty general|ly known. We are fir&s;t to have the fact of adul|tery re&s;i&s;ted, and it is to be contended, that the defendant is wholly innocent of it. If he is, we &s;hall &s;ee it. On my part, I &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h his guilt beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of contradiction.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of defence is this. Adulterers do not frequently give them&s;elves the trouble to en|quire how far a woman is virtuous before the hour
<PB N="68" REF="033585_0068_0FF7902111EE4178">
of appetite commences, but afterwards; and when the hu&s;band is ruined, and his peace of mind de|&s;troyed, then the adulterer is to hunt out what the lady was. On this or that occa&s;ion &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be this or that &s;ort of woman, in order to endeavour to le&s;&s;en the damages for the lo&s;s of her comfort and &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>I think this a whole&s;ome &s;pecies of defence, to wit, if it can be &s;hewn in a cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of ju&s;tice, that the hu&s;band, in&s;tead of treating his wife with affection and regard; if, in&s;tead of protecting her as he ought; if he is carele&s;s as to her conduct; if he permits her to mi&s;behave: and if he, as it were, encourages her in it, by conniving at particular in&s;tances that have come within his know|ledge; if he delivers her over almo&s;t into the hands of the adulterer, he cannot be driven out of a court of ju&s;tice with too much &s;hame and too much contempt. Though to Sir Matthew White Ridley, in former times, this woman, from her conduct, had become an object of &s;u&s;picion; if &s;he in con&s;equence of the reports that were circulated in prejudice of her virtue, had con&s;idered her conduct, and had become more and more affectionate to her hu&s;band; if &s;he was beginning, or had entirely got the better of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions; if &s;he was the mother of his child, and his affectionate wife in every part of her conduct; if ju&s;t as that &s;ort of &s;en&s;ation began to be felt by the hu&s;band; if ju&s;t when he had recovered his peace again; if he was broke in upon, and made a fit object for the hand of &s;corn to point out, (for &s;uch is the unhappy condition of every man in the plaintiff's &s;ituation however innocent) this defendant will have much to an&s;wer for to my much injured client. If a man happens to be married to a woman who mi&s;conducts her&s;elf, and di&s;honours her hu&s;band's bed, let his con|duct to her have been ever &s;o properly and exemplary, though he had afforded her every &s;pecies of protection, and &s;hewn her every kind of indulgence that might be ex|pected from a good and affectionate hu&s;band; yet the moment &s;he deviates from the paths of virtue, he in&s;tant|ly becomes the &s;ubject of &s;corn and contumely. I can|not
<PB N="69" REF="033585_0069_0FF79022B21D73D8">
conceive a more cruel &s;ituation. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with this &s;ort of opening.</P>
<P>The plaintiff was a mo&s;t affectionate hu&s;band to his wife. He was careful to di&s;cover whether &s;he was faith|ful to him, and no proof appearing of her infidelity, he continued to cheri&s;h her with that love, which his duty required he &s;hould.</P>
<P>Sir Matthew White Ridley, when he was mayor of Newca&s;tle, and had given the plaintiff a place under him, and had put him near to his per&s;on, took the advan|tage of that relation, to rob my unfortunate client of his peace of mind, and of that which was mo&s;t dear and valuable to him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no farther ob&s;ervations on this ca&s;e. The influence of the defendant, his life, his character, his fortune, are extremely well known to you; and from a long acquaintance with him, I believe him to be very much of a gentleman in all other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I have confined my ob&s;ervations to the cau&s;e before you, I &s;hall now call my witne&s;&s;es, and prove my ca&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="evidence">
<HEAD>EVIDENCE FOR THE PLAINTIFF</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t witne&s;s called on the part of the plaintiff was John Wil&s;on. He depo&s;ed, that he was intimately ac|quainted with Mr. Bromel and his lady; that they al|ways &s;eemed to him to live in the utmo&s;t harmony and friend&s;hip, and to have the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in each other's &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A few years ago, reports were circulated through New|ca&s;tle, which reflected on Mrs. Bromel's character and reputation, and which reports very &s;en&s;ibly affected Mr. Bromel, who &s;pared no pains to inve&s;tigate the truth of them: in con&s;equence of the mo&s;t minute examination, and &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny into the foundation of them, he was led to conclude that they were perfectly and complete|ly fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Eleanor Swinney, was next examined in &s;upport of the plaintiff's ca&s;e, and &s;he was the only witne&s;s to &s;ub&s;tan|tiate
<PB N="70" REF="033585_0070_0FF79028AD985530">
the fact upon which this action was grounded, name|ly, the adultery.</P>
<P>She depo&s;ed, that &s;he lived &s;ervant with the plaintiff; and that one night &s;he found the defendant and Mrs. Bromel together in the very act of adultery, on the &s;tair|ca&s;e in Mr. Bromel's hou&s;e, in Newca&s;tle. She did not di&s;cover this to any body, till eight months after. The rea&s;on &s;he a&s;&s;igned, why &s;he had kept it &s;ecret &s;o long, was that Mrs. Bromel told her that &s;he would poi&s;on her&s;elf if the witne&s;s &s;hould reveal to her ma&s;ter that &s;he had &s;een her mi&s;tre&s;s and Sir M. W. Ridley, in the act of a|dultery.</P>
<P>Mr. Law, as coun&s;el for Sir M. W. Ridley, made a mo&s;t excellent defence for his client. It had, he &s;aid, been fairly admitted by his learned friend, in the out&s;et, that the character and reputation of the plaintiff's wife, had been extremely &s;u&s;picious long before the defendant and &s;he had become acquainted. And this was a mo&s;t material circum&s;tance for the con&s;ideration of a jury. It had al&s;o been very candidly admitted, that the Gen|tlemen of the Jury were not a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e of trying the defendant for a crime; but the only que&s;|tion was (if they believed the &s;ervant, who undoubtedly, if credit was given to her te&s;timony, had proved the a|dultery) what damage they would give. Even if the Jury &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to believe her te&s;timony, he &s;ubmitted that this was only a ca&s;e for very &s;mall dama|ges.</P>
<P>He remarked on the va&s;t number of actions of this &s;ort that were brought into courts of ju&s;tice, &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of getting money, as it frequently turned out, that the hu&s;band had even encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his wife in the commi&s;&s;ion of this offence. When that was the ca&s;e, it did not lie in his mouth to complain that he had &s;uffered that to which he had freely a&s;&s;ented; and which, perhaps, could not po&s;&s;ibly have happened but by his con&s;ent or connivance. He did not however contend, that was the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent plaintiff.</P>
<P>The defendant was a gentleman of high honour, and
<PB N="71" REF="033585_0071_0FF7902A45146A40">
had a large family of children by his mo&s;t amiable lady. The Gentlemen of the Jury were complete judges of every cau&s;e of this kind, and he had no difficulty in com|mitting to them the ca&s;e of his client; being perfectly a&s;&s;ured that they would do &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice between the parties.</P>
<P>Lord Kenyon, in his excellent addre&s;s to the Gentle|men of the Jury, after lamenting the frequency of actions of this nature, and the depravity of the age, ob&s;erved, that there were infinite degrees of &s;hades in actions of this &s;ort, and that each of them depended on circum&s;tances peculiar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the adultery which was the foun|dation of the action, had been proved, if credit was given to Mrs. Swinney. It therefore &s;eemed that the plain|tiff was entitled to their verdict and the &s;ingle que&s;tion was undoubtedly the que&s;tion of damages. He &s;hould not &s;ay a &s;ingle &s;yllable on that point to the twelve Gen|tlemen who were a&s;&s;embled before him: they were per|fectly competent to the ta&s;k of deciding between the parties in this cau&s;e; and he could admini&s;ter no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to them. It was extremely probable &s;ome of the Gentlemen of the Jury were hu&s;bands them&s;elves. His lord&s;hip de&s;ired them to put them&s;elves in the &s;ituation of the plaintiff, and whatever damages they &s;hould think them&s;elves entitled to in that ca&s;e, to give the &s;ame to the plaintiff.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Jury withdrew for twenty mi|nutes, or half an hour, to con&s;ider of their verdict, and found for the plaintiff&mdash;Damages, Four Hundred Pounds.</P>

<HEAD>Trial of Mrs. Liege, for Adultery with Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, during the ab&s;ence of her Hu&s;band. In the Con|&s;i&s;tory Court of London, February 24, 1791.</HEAD>
<P>THIS trial pre&s;ents us with a feature of novelty upon its very fir&s;t face; viz. a Sailor's divorce; a thing as re|markable for its rarity, at lea&s;t according to the forms of law, as Sailor's weddings, without the&s;e forms, are for the frequency of their occurrence.</P>
<P>Peter Liege, gentleman, of Broad-&s;treet, in the pari&s;h of St. George in the Ea&s;t, aged 71 years and upwards father of Peter William Liege, the principal party in this cau&s;e, &s;aid, that in June 1783 his &s;on was the comman|der of the merchant &s;hip the Kent, then bound to Phila|delphia, and that when that &s;hip &s;ailed from England, with many other pa&s;&s;engers, there was a lady and her daughter who went by the name of Taylor, but who&s;e real name he had &s;ince learned was Thomas. Peter W. Liege, he &s;aid, at the time of his &s;ailing was a batchelor, free from all contracts, &amp;c. and that when he retuned to England, about a twelvemonth after, in June 1784, he brought the daughter of Mrs. Thomas with him, &s;ince Mrs. Liege, and whom he under&s;tood he was married to about the month of September 1783, at Philadelphia. At their return afore&s;aid, they took lodg|ings in Broad-&s;treet, and lived and cohabited together at bed and board, and con&s;ummated their marriage, hav|ing two children, a boy and a girl, &s;ince dead.</P>
<P>In the year 1787, it &s;eems, that Peter W. Liege en|tered into the Ea&s;t India &s;ervice, as mate of a &s;hip, and in con&s;equence of that was mo&s;tly abroad, in parts be|yond the &s;ea, in his profe&s;&s;ion, till March 1789. When

Mr. Liege &s;ailed in the Nottingham Ea&s;t Indiaman, in March 1789, he left his wife in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his apart|ment and furniture in Broad-&s;treet, and Mr. Alderman Curtis, being his agent, had orders to &s;upply his wife with &s;uch money as &s;he &s;tood in need of. Mr. Liege returned to England in June 1790; but as his father was appri&s;ed of the conduct of his wife, he no &s;ooner heard that the &s;hip Nottingham had arrived in the Downs, but he wrote a letter to his &s;on, informing him that his wife had conducted her&s;elf improperly during his ab&s;ence, and de&s;iring he would not &s;ee her till he had fir&s;t &s;een &s;ome of his friends. Of cour&s;e he believed that the &s;aid Mr. Liege did not quit the &s;hip Nottingham till &s;he came in|to long Reach. He further &s;aid, that he verily believed that Elizabeth Liege did commit adultery with one Wingtworth Tonge, or &s;ome &s;trange man or other, by whom &s;he had a female child; of which he was inform|ed &s;he was delivered in Parker's Buildings, near Ber|mond&s;ey Spa&mdash;And further, that his &s;on never lived or cohabited with her &s;ince his return to England.</P>
<P>The Reverend Jacob Duch&eacute;, of Sloane-&s;treet, Chel|&s;ea, and a mini&s;ter among the people called Swedenbor|gians, confirmed the te&s;timony of the marriage of the parties, &s;aying, that being well acquainted with Dr. White, the Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop of Penn&s;ylvania he very well knew the manner and character of his hand-writing, having frequently &s;een him write and &s;ub&s;cribe his name &mdash;He therefore believed the Exhibit to contain a true copy of the entry of the marriage of the parties.</P>
<P>Ann Mitchell, of Lamb Green, in the pari&s;h of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermond&s;ey, &s;pin&s;ter, aged 16 and up|wards, &s;aid, that &s;he went to live as a &s;ervant-maid with Mrs. Liege, at No. 4, Parker's Buildings, who then re&s;ided with a man that &s;he took to be Mr. Liege, as he always went by that name, and pa&s;&s;ed for Mrs. Liege's hu&s;band, but whom &s;he &s;ince under&s;tood was a Mr. Wingtworth Tonge. All the time &s;he lived with them, &s;he &s;aid, they cohabited together as man and wife, and lay &s;everal times naked and alone in the &s;ame bed;
<PB N="74" REF="033585_0074_0FF7903377B5C7A0">
and, therefore, this young <HI>delicate</HI> witne&s;s verily be|lieved they had oftentimes committed the <HI>foul</HI> crime of adultery, and all that, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Martha Moody, the wa&s;herwoman, next depo&s;ed, that living in Parker's Building's, &s;he was al&s;o engaged to attend Mrs. Liege during her lying-in, and that when fir&s;t engaged by Mrs. Liege &s;he under&s;tood &s;he was a married woman, and that her hu&s;band was to come to her very &s;oon: and that &s;he was al&s;o pre&s;ent when Mrs. Liege was delivered of a female child, about four o'clock one morning, in the month of September.</P>
<P>She further mentioned, that &s;he nur&s;ed Mrs. Liege &s;even weeks in the whole, but, that during the la&s;t three weeks, a man came and re&s;ided with her, who called him&s;elf Mr. Liege, but who&s;e name &s;he has &s;ince un|der&s;tood to be Tonge. As in this interval &s;he &s;lept in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and u&s;ed to take the infant to its mother to &s;uckle two or three times in a night, &s;he had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing them naked and in bed together; and, therefore, &s;he al&s;o verily believed that they had often committed the foul crime of adultery together.</P>
<P>Henry Radford, &s;urgeon and man-midwife, of New|ington-Place, &s;aid, that on the 26th day of Augu&s;t la&s;t, he received a note from Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, of whom he had a &s;light knowledge, informing him that he had a female friend that wanted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that he was &s;oon after introduced to a lady who&s;e name he has &s;ince learned is Liege; that &s;uch lady was then with child, and very near her time; and that he accordingly delivered her of a female child, on Friday the 3d of September following, about five in the morning in the pre&s;ence of Martha Moody.</P>
<P>Mary Penney, wife of John Penney, taylor, of Bird|&s;treet, in the pari&s;h of St. George's, Middle&s;ex, traced the connection further back. She &s;aid, &s;he and her hu&s;|band lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e in Broad-&s;treet with Mrs. Liege, when a per&s;on of the name of Tonge u&s;ed to come backwards and forwards to vi&s;it Mrs. Liege, and u&s;ed to continue, perhaps alone, with her a con&s;iderable

time. All this witne&s;s then under&s;tood of Mrs. Liege was, that &s;he was a married woman, and had a hu&s;band in the Ea&s;t Indies, and that &s;he then appeared to be about &s;ix months gone with child.</P>
<P>Abraham Wat&s;on Rutherford, of Bond Court, St. Stephens, Walbroke, London, merchant, &s;aid, that he was well acquainted with Peter William Liege, on ac|count of marrying his &s;i&s;ter in 1785, and had known him in all for a period of 27 years. He perfectly re|membered their taking lodgings in Broad-&s;treet, and co|habiting together as lawful man and wife, and their hav|ing two children&mdash;That Mr. Liege made three voyages as ma&s;ter or mate of different &s;hips, leaving Mrs. Liege in town during the &s;ame; and that on his departure the la&s;t time, he gave Mr. Rutherford 40 guineas partly for the payment of the rent of Mrs. Liege's apartments at different payments, the remainder to be given to Mrs. Liege, at Mr. Rutherford's direction. And he further under&s;tood from Mr. Alderman Curtis, who was Mr. Liege's owner, that he had orders to &s;uply Mrs. Liege with money to the amount of twenty or twenty-five pounds a year. And that whenever the &s;aid Mr. Liege was going a voyage, he always laid in a &s;tock of liquor, coals and other nece&s;&s;aries for her u&s;e, and in every o|ther re&s;pect always made an ample provi&s;ion for her, fully adequate to his circum&s;tances and &s;tation.</P>
<P>During Mr. Liege's ab&s;ence, he had frequently &s;een his wife in London, and other places adjacent; but being informed of her improper conduct, as &s;oon as he heard of the arrival of her hu&s;band in the Downs, he wrote two letters to him, informing him of the &s;ame, and cautioning him not to admit his wife into the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould &s;he come to vi&s;it him, till he had &s;een him, which happened on the 31&s;t of May, when Mr. Liege came to Mr. Rutherford's hou&s;e, who afterwards ac|compained him along with a Mr. Thomas Seddon to Mrs. Liege's apartments, when &s;he, being taxed with an adulterous intercour&s;e with a Mr. Wingtworth Tonge, acknowledged it before them all, and added,

<P>THIS Trial, of merited celebrity, in the annals of pro&s;titution, for the audacious &s;cenes of impudent pro|fligacy it contains, is the next we &s;hall offer.</P>
<P>Of the evidence produced before the Epi&s;copal Court, James Bradley, a labouring man, of Moul&s;ey, remem|bered, that between &s;ix and &s;even years previous to the Trial, Major Arabin and his Wife came to live there:
<PB N="77" REF="033585_0077_0FF790389288A8D0">
he per&s;onally knew Thomas Sutton, jun. E&s;q. he well re|collected, that one day in the &s;ummer of 1782, as he and William Harwood, a labouring man, were walking to|gether up Moul&s;ey Common, by a place called Little|bale's Shrubbery, William Harwood &s;topped him and &s;aid, 'they &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome <HI>game!</HI> and pointing into the &s;hrubbery, he &s;aw Mrs. Arabin, the wife of Major Arabin, on the ground therein, with her petticoats up, and Thomas Sutton, E&s;q. jun. on her, in the very act of Adultery, as he mo&s;t firmly believes; and when they had fini&s;hed, he &s;aw Thomas Sutton, jun. E&s;q. get up, and help the &s;aid Mrs. Arabin up from the ground, and &s;aw him button up his breeches, and wipe his breeches knees with his handkerchief, and they then walked away together:' he entertained no doubt as to the identity of their per&s;ons, knowing them perfectly, and it then being a fine day, and he not farther from them than about a dozen yards; he had al&s;o frequently &s;een them riding out together, both before and after the &s;triking circum&s;tance ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>Maria Haynes, of Chert&s;ey, per&s;onally knew Major Arabin and his wife, and Thomas Sutton, jun. E&s;q. a|bout four or five years ago, being pa&s;&s;ing through a meadow near Moul&s;ey Common, about two or three in the afternoon, it being hay-making time, &s;he perceived Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton walking together alone, as &s;he had oftentimes &s;een them before, and pre&s;ently after|wards &s;aw them retire into a hollow way leading to a place called the Spa: Mrs. Arabin &s;eated her&s;elf upon the bank formed by the hollow, and Mr. Sutton unbuttoned his breeches, and gently throwing him&s;elf upon her, he pulled up her clothes, and &s;he plainly &s;aw him in the act of carnal copulation with her, being only about three or four yards di&s;tant from them, and concealed by the in|tervention of &s;ome trees and bu&s;hes.

<P>James Poulter, of Vauxhall, about four or five years previous to this Trial, entered into the &s;ervice of Major Arabin and his wife, as gardener and footman, at their hou&s;e at Ea&s;t Moul&s;ey: an acquaintance, he knew &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between the families of Major Arabin and Thomas Sutton, E&s;q. &s;en. who was Lord of the Manor, and par|ticularly between Mrs. Arabin and Thomas Sutton, jun. E&s;q. Quickly after he had been in the family of Mr. Arabin, he noticed the di&s;tingui&s;hed attention which Mr. Sutton ob&s;erved towards his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and with which &s;he appeared particularly well plea&s;ed: he oftentimes &s;aw them go out in company with each other, during the ab&s;ence of his ma&s;ter, arm in arm, in various places near Moul&s;ey, and the &s;cene of their excur&s;ions was more e&s;|pecially a &s;hrubbery named Littlehale's Shrubbery, be|longing to Thomas Sutton, E&s;q. His mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed gene|rally to ride out twice or three times a week on hor&s;e|back, attended by him; and Mr. Sutton, jun. u&s;ed al|mo&s;t invariably to join her, and ride with her upon Monl&s;ey Common; and if Mr. Sutton did not arrive as early as Mrs. Arabin, &s;he u&s;ed to di&s;patch him home on &s;ome frivilous pretence, only that &s;he might with more convenience wait for the arrival of her lover: when they have been riding together, Mr. Sutton more than once ki&s;&s;ed, and u&s;ed other familiarities with Mrs. Arabin, on hor&s;eback; &s;uch as putting his hand into her pocket|hole: when his mi&s;tre&s;s returned home, &s;he has twice or three times told Mr. Arabin, that &s;he had been at Sid|don

Wells, a place frequented by ladies for the purpo&s;e of bathing; when, in reality, &s;he has only been in com|pany with Mr. Sutton.</P>
<P>James Lawrence Brown, came per&s;onally to know Mr. and Mrs. Arabin, by living in the &s;ervice of George Molyneux, E&s;q. the brother of Mrs. Arabin. One Sun|day in the &s;ummer of 1779, or 1780, he being at the hou&s;e of Mr. Arabin, at Moul&s;ey, and his ma&s;ter and Mr. Arabin being gone out together, Betty Dod&s;on, a &s;ervant in the family, told him, that her mi&s;tre&s;s and Mr. Sutton (whom he knew by &s;ight) were in the parlour alone; in about three quarters of an hour afterwards, he, being in the kitchen, heard the parlour door open, and going to &s;ee, ju&s;t catched a glimp&s;e of Mr. Sutton, going out at the front door of the hou&s;e, and al&s;o perceived Mrs. A|rabin coming out of the parlour: &s;oon afterwards Bet&s;y Dod&s;on called him into the parlour, and going in, he per|ceived one of the windows to be very much blinded, and an arm-chair near the window much tumbled and pow|dered, and &s;everal black pins upon it: ju&s;t before the chair upon the ground, he &s;aw &s;ome &s;eed or matter which comes from a man in the act of copulation; on di&s;cov|ering the &s;ame, he called Betty Dod&s;on, and pointed with his foot to the &s;ame, and &s;he looked at it and &s;miled: from this he was in his con&s;cience &s;atisfied, that Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton had had criminal conver&s;ation, and committed the crime of adultery with each other.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Dod&s;on lived &s;ervant in the family of Mr. and Mrs. Arabin. Mrs. Arabin had one child during her marriage, and &s;he verily believed that Mr. Arabin behaved to his wife in a manner be|coming a good hu&s;band, and was ever particularly indulgent in his conduct towards her. Soon after &s;he went to live with them, they went to re&s;ide at their country hou&s;e at Ea&s;t Moul&s;ey, and the fre|quency of Mr. Sutton's vi&s;its there &s;oon became apparent: he and Mrs. Arabin found frequent op|portunities of being alone together, and particular|ly when Mr. Arabin was out, which was general|ly
<PB N="80" REF="033585_0080_0FF77DCD355F19E8">
the ca&s;e in the forenoon, he being either on hor&s;eback, or el&s;e obliged to attend his duty as a Major in the Hor&s;e Guards: directly he was gone, it frequently happened that Mr. Sutton called, and &s;oon afterwards he and Mrs. Arabin u&s;ed to walk or ride together; at other times when Mr. Arabin has gone out, Mr. Sutton has pre&s;ented him&s;elf in a field before the hou&s;e, and Mrs. Arabin on &s;eeing him, would wave her handkerch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ef to him, put on her things, &amp;c. and immediately repair to him: at all times they were arm in arm together, and would frequently retire into a &s;ummer-hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance from Mr. Arabin's dwelling-hou&s;e: oftentimes after their excur&s;ions, Mrs. Arabin's dre&s;s would look very loo&s;e and di&s;ordered, e&s;pecially her hair and head, though &s;he was remarkably nice in adju&s;ting her attire previous to her going out. One Sunday in the year 1779 or 1780, Mr. Arabin and Mr. Molyneux went out together, and &s;oon after Thomas Sutton, E&s;q. came in, and went into the parlour to Mrs. Arabin; after they had remained there &s;hut up alone for the &s;pace of half an hour, they went out. Betty Dod&s;on going into the parlour directly, impelled by curio&s;ity to &s;ee which way they went, found the curtains let down, though they were not &s;o before; Mr. Molyneux's &s;ervant followed her into the room, and while &s;he was drawing up one of the curtains, called her to him, and upon the ground clo&s;e by an arm-chair, he &s;hewed her &s;ome &s;eed or matter, which comes from a man in the act of copulation, and a&s;ked her if &s;he knew what it was? And upon attentively looking at it, &s;he re|plied &s;he did, and could well undertake to &s;peak po&s;itive|ly thereto, being a married woman: the cover of the arm chair was very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umbled and dirted with hair|powder, and &s;everal black pins were upon it, and from all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, Betty Dod&s;on was well convin|ced that Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton had had the carnal knowledge of each other.</P>
<P>Towards the winter of the year 1779, Betty Dod&s;on &s;aid, they u&s;ed to walk alone in a &s;hubbery very near to

the hou&s;e (the &s;hrubbery called Littlehales) and very frequently arm in arm; after Mr. Sutton had gone, Mrs. Arabin u&s;ed to come to Betty Dod&s;on under the &s;hed where &s;he was milking, and &s;it down and compo&s;e her hair and dre&s;s, which at the&s;e times have appeared very much ruffled, though &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed very neatly when &s;he went out. When the family was in town, at Major Arabin's hou&s;e in Poland-&s;treet, Oxford-road, Mr. Sutton u&s;ed frequently to walk by the door and if the Major was not within, Mrs. Arabin would go out and call after him. Betty Dod&s;on twice &s;aw them meet in the &s;treet when &s;he was going to market, and on their meeting they very cordially joined and walked off arm in arm together.</P>
<P>What excellent topics for &s;candal, mu&s;t the proceedings of this frolick&s;ome couple have furni&s;hed to the barren circle of a country vicinity; the retailers of &s;candal, and the &s;elf-appointed cen&s;ors of morals, who abound &s;o plentifully in every neighbourhood, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the ridings out, the &s;hrubby excur&s;ions, &amp;c. &amp;c. and tho&s;e decent little intimacies of friend&s;hip, the publicly &s;aluting a Lady, or putting a hand into her pocket-hole to&mdash;look for her &s;nuff-box or handkerchief, with a &s;ur|pri&s;ing combination of mirth and re&s;entment; the vari|ous clo&s;ettings of the parties of Mr. Arabin's hou&s;e, mu&s;t have furni&s;hed a fund of the mo&s;t inexhau&s;tible en|tertainment for the kitchen fire-&s;ide, and contributed wonderfully towards improving the <HI>morals</HI> of the do|me&s;tics of the family: how admirable an opportunity did the &s;ervant of Mr. Molyneux di&s;cover to di&s;play a joking drollery, when pointing with his foot towards the arm-chair in the parlour (from whence Mrs Arabin and Mr. Sutton had ju&s;t retired) he a&s;ked Betty Dod&s;on her opinion of a certain appearance very vi&s;ible on the floor! and how excellent an occa&s;ion did it furni&s;h to &s;how her &s;kill and knowledge as a <HI>married woman,</HI> when attentiv|ly con&s;idering it, &s;he found her&s;elf enabled to reply with &s;o much pointedne&s;s to the intimation of the queri&s;t.

Mr. Sutton, jun. was very much in the company of Mrs. Arabin in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, and his attention &s;eemed to give her a pecu|liar &s;atisfaction: they oftentimes walked out arm in arm, and rode out together, and many liberties were taken by each party with the other on the&s;e occa&s;ions: in the ab&s;ence of Mr. Arabin, they have been &s;everal times &s;hut up by them&s;elves in the parlour at Moul&s;ey; after their departure, the chairs and carpet have been covered with powder, black pins, &amp;c. and almo&s;t always in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that &s;ome per&s;ons appeared to have lain on them whenever they went out together, the dre&s;s of Mrs. Arabin was particulary neat and &s;mart; one even|ing when every per&s;on was out excepting this foot|boy, Thomas Girdler and his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;ent him to fetch a pot of beer, and on his returning with it, &s;he came into the kitchen, took the beer from him, and carried it into the parlour her&s;elf: about elev|en at night he heard the parlour bell ring, and go|ing in, his mi&s;tre&s;s told him to take the pot away, which he found quite empty; from which circum|&s;tance, and her not requiring his attendance as u&s;ual, he was &s;atisfied that Mr. Sutton had been in company with her during the greater part of that evening.</P>
<P>On the next evening, Mr. Arabin being from home the boy &s;u&s;pecting that his mi&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Mr.

Sutton were alone together though he had not heard him come into the hou&s;e, re&s;olved to look through the key-hole; taking off his &s;hoes, he &s;tept &s;oftly to the parlour door; li&s;tening, he heard the creaking of a chair, and the &s;ound of two per&s;ons voices, and looking through the key-hole, he perceived, by the fire light, his mi&s;tre&s;s and Mr. Sutton in an arm-chair clo&s;e to each other: upon this, he run and a&s;ked a boy called William Charles, to come and &s;ee, which he did, and then they both looked through the key-hole; he was perfectly &s;atisfied that the parties then committed adultery together. The next morning, one of the chairs appeared to be very much tumbled and powdered, with &s;everal black pins on it; the print of a mans foot on the whole fill of the window was remarkably plain, and that was apparantly occa|&s;ioned by Mr. Sutton's getting in at the window, in order to enter the hou&s;e with the greater &s;ecre&s;y. Ano|ther day, when Mr. Arabin was from home, Mrs. Ara|bin ordered the cloth to be laid for dinner in the libra|ry-room oppo&s;ite the bed-chamber door: after dinner, &s;he went into the kitchen, and told the footboy to get &s;ome large coals and leave them on the top of the &s;tairs, &s;aying, &s;he would take them in her&s;elf; the boy &s;aw no more of her that evening; the next morning entering the room, he perceived the carpet and chairs to be very much powdered, black pins laying about &amp;c. from which he was convinced, that his mi&s;tre&s;s and Mr. Sut|ton had been the whole afternoon &s;hut up together.</P>
<P>During the family's re&s;iding at Moul&s;ey, the footboy &s;aid, his mi&s;tre&s;s and Mr. Sutton u&s;ed frequently to ride out together; the boy attended them, and was very often ordered to ride on and leave them alone: &s;ometimes they would ride together till very late, and Mr. Sutton never u&s;ed to accompany Mrs. Arabin to her own hou&s;e, but always left her before they came near there; when &s;he arrived home, &s;he u&s;ed fre|quently to tell Mr. Arabin that &s;he had not met any
<PB N="84" REF="033585_0084_0FF7904B549F4048">
per&s;on during her ride. When the family was in town, in the winter of 1783, Mr. Arabin going one day to Ea&s;t Moul&s;ey, he had not been out of the hou&s;e long before Mr. Sutton called, and enquired if Mr. or Mrs. Arabin were at home; the footboy told him, that his mi&s;tre&s;s was gone out, and his ma&s;ter was in the coun|try; but as he was &s;peaking, Nanny Gatehou&s;e, Mrs, Arabin's maid, came running down &s;tairs, and informed Mr. Sutton that her mi&s;tre&s;s was at home, but that &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing, and that if he would walk &s;omewhere and call in half an hour, he might &s;ee her; he did go away, and returned in about that time, and was &s;hewn into the dining-room: pre&s;ently afterwards, Nanny Gatehou&s;e came to the footboy, and told him he mu&s;t deny Mrs. Arabin to every body but Mr. Sutton; he &s;taid with her at that time longer than an hour, and, as the boy had every rea&s;on to think, was alone with her during the whole of the time, in the back room into which the dining-room led; two of the chairs were very much powdered e&s;pecially the back parts of them.</P>
<P>Thomas Parker; &s;ervant to Major Arabin, was or|dered by his ma&s;ter to go to the Pari&s;h Church of St. Mi|chan, in the city of Dublin, and examine the regi&s;ter-book of Marriages kept for that pari&s;h: he found an entry of the marriage of William John Arabin, E&s;q. and Henrietta Molyneux, &s;pin&s;ter, of which he took a copy, and then carefully compared it with the original: and he was well convinced, that William John Arabin his ma&s;ter, and Henrietta Arabin his wife, were the &s;ame parties as tho&s;e mentioned in the regi&s;ter. Thomas Parker remembered, when the family was at Moul&s;ey, frequently &s;eeing Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton, jun. walking arm in arm, in a &s;hrubbery, near the hou&s;e, called the Manor hou&s;e, or Littlehale's &s;hrubbery, belonging to Mr. Sutton's fa|ther, and at other places contiguous to Moul&s;ey; at the&s;e times Mr. Arabin was generally from home, and when Mrs. Arabin has returned from the&s;e excur&s;ions, her hair has appeared tumbled, and her dre&s;s greatly di&s;ordered and rumpled, though &s;he was very neat when
<PB N="85" REF="033585_0085_0FF7904D077437E8">
&s;he went out, which, indeed, always was the ca&s;e when &s;he intended meeting Mr. Sutton.</P>
<P>One day, while the re&s;idence of the family was at Moul&s;ey, in the year 1779, as Thomas Parker entered the hou&s;e, Bet&s;ey Dod&s;on, and Lawrence Browne, told him that there had been <HI>fine work</HI> in the parlour, between Mrs. Arabin and Mr. Sutton, and de&s;ired him to &s;tep into the parlour and &s;ee; on entering it, Tho|mas Parker perceived an arm-chair to be very much tum|bled, and a great deal of hair powder upon it; ju&s;t be|fore the chair on the ground, he ob&s;erved &s;ome wet, o|ver which a per&s;on's foot had apparently been drawn, but what &s;uch wet was, he could by no means form an opinion by his own ob&s;ervation, as the &s;ame was nearly rubbed out: on that day Major Arabin and Mr. Moly|neux had gone out pretty &s;oon in the morning, and did not return till nearl dark in the evening: after the fa|mily's arrival in town in the winter of the year 1779, Mrs. Arabin u&s;ed oftentimes to walk out attended by Thomas Parker, on the pretence of paying vi&s;its, but almo&s;t always Mr. Sutton jun. met her in the &s;treet, and then it was their cu&s;tom to walk together for a con&s;ider|able time; on Mrs. Arabin's return, &s;he has frequently told her hu&s;band, in the pre&s;ence of Thomas Parker, that &s;he had been paying vi&s;its to &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, when &s;he has, in reality, been the whole time in com|pany with Mr. Sutton; afterwards &s;he has di&s;patched Thomas Parker, with cards to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;he has told her hu&s;band &s;he has been vi&s;iting with the view of preventing detection.</P>
<P>William Graham, gentleman, clerk in the office of Me&s;&s;rs Graham, Attornies at Law, Lincoln's Inn, prov|ed Mr. Arabin's obtaining damages by action, in the &s;um of one hundred pounds, again&s;t Thomas Sutton, jun. E&s;q. in a cau&s;e tried in the Court of King's Bench, before William Earl of Mansfie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and a Jury duly im|pannelled and &s;worn: he al&s;o te&s;tified, that the copy of the verdict was a true copy. This was the whole of the evidence on the part of the pro&s;ecution; on the other
<PB N="86" REF="033585_0086_0FF79141B9B869B8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, nothing was advanced. The Sentence was, that 'upon hearing the depo&s;itions in this cau&s;e, it was de|creed and adjudged, that Mrs. Henrietta Arabin be divorced from bed, board, and mutual cohabitation with William John Arabin, E&s;q. her hu&s;band, and by rea&s;on of Adultery.'</P>
<P>To the particular ob&s;ervations which have occurred little more can be added, than that on a view of the whole of the glaring circum&s;tances adduced in the cour&s;e of evidence, a&s;toni&s;hment mu&s;t be the prevailing feeling in every reflecting mind.</P>

<HEAD>The Trial of the celebrated Mrs. Erring|ton, for Adultery with Arthur Mur|ray Smith, E&s;q. Captain Buckley, Captain Southby, Captain Roberts; the Rev. Mr. Walker, Mr. Trayte, Mr. Clarke, and Mr. Daniel.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t depo&s;ition in this curious trial, is that of Mary Steven&s;on, who lived as a &s;ervant with Mr. and Mrs. Errington. Herevidence amounts to this: That a Captain Smith lived at her ma&s;ter's hou&s;e about three months; that her ma&s;ter was in the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, and generally left home about eight o'clock in the morning, and did not return till four or five in the after|noon, or later; that during her ma&s;ter's ab&s;ence, &s;he has almo&s;t daily &s;een Captain Smith toying with and ki&s;&s;ing her mi&s;tre&s;s, and putting his hand in her bo&s;om, and through her pocket holes, at which &s;he would &s;eem plea|&s;ed and happy: at other times &s;he has &s;een her mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="87" REF="033585_0087_0FF77DD46B510CE0">
&s;itting on the Captain's knee, with her arm round his neck or on his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t have created &s;trange emotions in the bo|&s;om of the &s;pectator, who was then about twenty-three or twenty-four years of age. She doubtle&s;s imagined &s;omething was intended be&s;ides picking the lady's pocket when the Captain put his hand through her pocket holes. Her feelings mu&s;t afterwards have been greatly heighten|ed; for, from the circum&s;tances that followed, &s;he mu&s;t have known that tho&s;e degitations were a prelude to a more capital &s;cene.</P>
<P>She then &s;ays, that, "in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band, when Captain Smith and her mi&s;tre&s;s have been together in the parlour, the little boy has been &s;ent out of the room, and &s;he has frequently, after that, found the door fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide; and, her mi&s;tre&s;s hearing her, would &s;ometimes open the door to her, and &s;ometimes not, but give her &s;ome an&s;wer from within; and that, when &s;he has opened the door, &s;he would appear rather embara&s;&s;ed, her hair being greatly di&s;ordered, and her handkerchief and cloaths much rumpled." She there|fore &s;ays, that, "&s;he believes, in her con&s;cience, that the &s;aid parties, at &s;uch times, were criminally connected with each other"</P>
<P>After mentioning &s;ome trifling particulars, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Captain Smith going frequently into her mi&s;tre&s;s's bed-chamber, and &s;he into the Captain's, and that the beds were afterwards found greatly tumbled; &s;he &s;ays, 'She has twice or thrice &s;een her mi&s;tre&s;s in the Captain's breeches, coat and wai&s;tcoat; and that, at &s;uch times, the Captain and &s;he would help to undre&s;s each other.</P>
<P>Whether Polly Steven&s;on envied her mi&s;tre&s;s, we can|not undertake to &s;ay, but, it clearly appears, that this toying between the Captain and her mi&s;tre&s;s, engaged much of her attention, for &s;he often watched them into the hay-loft together, whither they repaired under pre|tence of finding eggs; and &s;he &s;ays, 'Her mi&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he returned, had her cloaths much tumbled, and in great di&s;order.' At tho&s;e times, &s;he &s;ays, 'She had no doubt
<PB N="88" REF="033585_0088_0FF790500F1B2448">
upon her mind, that the &s;aid parties had a criminal connection."</P>
<P>Mrs. Polly al&s;o watched the waters of the poor curate of Batter&s;ea. Cruel, indeed, that he could not be ad|mitted to give her mi&s;tre&s;s a little &s;piritual con&s;olation, but &s;he mu&s;t put a carnal con&s;truction upon his intentions. She &s;ays, 'She &s;aw Mr. Walker and her mi&s;tre&s;s come out of the bed-chamber together,' and without further evidence of any thing criminal &s;he runs immediately to the kitchen and tells her fellow &s;ervants, that &s;he be|lieved 'the par&s;on and her mi&s;tre&s;s had been in a fit to|gether on the bed.'</P>
<P>How depraved mu&s;t the mind of Polly Steven&s;on have been, to form &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition! Does &s;he ima|gine that nothing but carnalities can be practi&s;ed in a bed-room? Might not he and Mrs. Errington, who was one of his pari&s;honers, have been joining in &s;ome religious exerci&s;es, in&s;tead of perpetrating the horrid crime of a|dultery? Might they not have been conning over the
<Q>le&s;&s;ons of the day, and turning over the &s;heet of the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s?</Q>
Might he not have pulled out of his pocket 'The Whole Duty of Man,' and have poin|ted out particular intere&s;ting practical pa&s;&s;ages! Was he not, thought in a &s;ubordinate degree, the &s;hepherd of the pari&s;h; and was not &s;he one of his lambs?&mdash;But, if a tran&s;action will bear two con&s;tructions, Polly &s;eems to delight in giving it the wor&s;t. It is po&s;&s;ible that, having a &s;trong tendency to fornication her&s;elf, &s;he &s;up|po&s;es a 'pair of people' cannot go into a 'bed-room' without committing adultery; and actually &s;ays, that '&s;he firmly believe that a criminal connection had pa&s;&s;ed between them.' She does not indeed mention the gro&s;s and indelicate words 'carnal knowledge.'</P>
<P>She then relates that 'her mi&s;tre&s;s, being once in a coach with her, put her head out of the window, and a&s;ked a &s;mart officer how he did, and he came up to the coach, and the coach &s;topped, and he opened the door and got in; and Mrs. Errington carried him to her hu&s;|band's hou&s;e, where he &s;taid to tea, and continued alone
<PB N="89" REF="033585_0089_0FF790542DA950D8">
with her in the parlour &s;ome time; and that, from their conver&s;ation it appeared, that &s;uch officer was an entire &s;tranger to Mrs. Errington. That a great intimacy af|terwards took place between them, and it appeared that this officer's name was Buckley.</P>
<P>The Captain made his attacks in nearly the &s;ame or|der as Captain Smith, and in particular, regularly be&s;ieg|ed the bo&s;om and the pocket-holes. Mary Stephen&s;on ob&s;erves al&s;o, that, 'whil&s;t her ma&s;ter was on a journey to Oxford, her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;taid out all night twice,' and &s;eems to conjecture that captain Buckley was with her.</P>
<P>Jacob Endamaur comes forward as the next witne&s;s, and &s;ays, 'he was a &s;ervant to Mr. and Mrs. Erington, and has frequently &s;een Captain Smith and his mi&s;tre&s;s ki&s;&s;ing, toying, and romping together, and has &s;een his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;itting upon the Captain's knee, and her hair and cloaths in great di&s;order.' He makes no criminal charge again&s;t the curate, but only &s;ays, he u&s;ed now and then to vi&s;it and drink tea at the hou&s;e of his &s;aid ma&s;ter, and that he never &s;aw any thing improper pa&s;s between him and his mi&s;tre&s;s.'</P>
<P>He then confirms the evidence given by Mary Ste|ren&s;on, re&s;pecting captain Buckley, and adds, that 'about two months before he left Mr. Errington's &s;ervice, as he went into the parlour, where Captain Buckley and his mi&s;tre&s;s were alone together, to throw &s;ome coals on the fire, and entering rather &s;uddenly, he &s;aw his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;itting in an elbow|chair, and Captain Buckley &s;tanding before her; that upon his coming in, Captain Buckly turned immediately away, and appeared to be buttoning up his breeches; and they appeared to be in very great confu&s;ion.'</P>
<P>Hence he concludes, that 'they either had been, or were prevented by him from being, criminally acquainted together.'</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, however, who pretend to be in the &s;e|cret affirm, that nothing of that kind was then tran&s;acting; but the lady was admini&s;tering &s;ome|thing
<PB N="90" REF="033585_0090_0FF7905606888FC8">
to the Captain, in a particular part, to de&s;|troy a &s;pecies of te&s;taceous in&s;ects, which were at that time very trouble&s;ome and inconvenient to him. She was acting, it is pre&s;umed, the part of 'Lady Bountiful,' by endeavouring to de&s;troy &s;uch noxious ver|min; and yet Jacob Endamaur mo&s;t uncharitably con|jectures, that &s;he was engaged with the Captain in bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a very different nature!</P>
<P>He adds, that 'he has often &s;een them ki&s;&s;ing and fondling each other; and once &s;aw the Captain ki&s;&s;ing her naked brea&s;t.' He concludes with &s;aying, 'that he does in his con&s;cience believe, that the &s;aid parties had frequently had the carnal knowledge of each other.'</P>
<P>Philip Dixon, clerk to Mr. Errington, be&s;ides con|firming &s;ome of the particulars already mentioned, depo|&s;es, that captain Buckley, at fir&s;t, 'would &s;tand in a lane ju&s;t by the hou&s;e, as if upon the watch: and, up|on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, Mrs. Errington would go to him, and bring him home, or &s;tay &s;ome time with him, and he has known her &s;tay in the lane with him till eleven o'clock at night. That at length, the Captain grew more audacious in his behavior, and would come with|in about a quarter of an hour after Mr. Errington was gone out; and, without a&s;king any que&s;tions, would run up &s;tairs, whi&s;tling or &s;inging, into Mrs. Errington's bed-chamber, dre&s;&s;ing-room, or parlour, wherever &s;he happened to be. That once, in particular, he remem|bers Captain Buckley and Mrs. Errington coming into a room called the library, where the deponent u&s;ually &s;at to write, and while they were in the room, the Captain went up to her in a very familiar manner, and, as &s;he re|tired backwards, he followed her until &s;he came with her back again&s;t the bookca&s;e; and then pu&s;hed his hand in a mo&s;t indecent manner, again&s;t her cloaths, between her thighs, and Mrs. Errington gently pu&s;hed him from her, and they both went out of the room.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars are &s;o very open and apparent, as to require very little comment or elucidation. Mrs. Errington, on their fir&s;t interview, behaves with great
<PB N="91" REF="033585_0091_0FF79057ACE2D458">
freedom to the Captain; and he in his turn &s;eems to have exactly followed her example. In &s;hort he acted as ma&s;|ter of the hou&s;e, and one would imagine he really thought him&s;elf &s;o; but his audacity at la&s;t was in&s;up|portable; Mr. Philip Dixon therefore, communicated his &s;u&s;picions, or rather facts, to Mr. Errington, and a &s;eperation con&s;equently took place between him and his wife, and Mr. Dixon believes that Mr. Errington has never &s;ince cohabited with her.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance of her behaviour, mentioned by Mr. Dixon, is too material to be ommitted. He &s;ays, 'Mr. Errington's hou&s;e in Adam-&s;treet, was exact|ly faceing the hotel, kept by William O&s;borne, in the &s;ame &s;treet; and that Mrs. Errington, when her hu&s;band was ab&s;ent upon bu&s;ine&s;s, very frequently went out and &s;taid for hours together, and often u&s;ed to return home with various gentlemen, &s;trangers to the deponent, and appeared but newly acquainted with Mrs. Errington.</P>
<P>There never was a more indu&s;trious woman in her line, than our heroine. Idlene&s;s &s;he &s;eems to have had an aver&s;ion to, and upon all occa&s;ions preferred an active life. Her genero&s;ity too was unbounded; &s;he did not confine her&s;elf to a &s;mall circle, and deal out favours with a par&s;imonious hand, but liberally di&s;tributed them to every one that a&s;ked, and frequently even una&s;ked. If the riches of a kingdom depends upon its population, (a point in which all our politicians &s;eem to be agreed) Mrs. Errington mu&s;t certainly be a valuable member of &s;oci|ety; her whole time is employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of pro|creation, and &s;he con&s;tantly exerts her be&s;t endeavours to make new &s;ubjects for the &s;tate. She has not, indeed, been very &s;uce&s;sful in her endeavours, therefore &s;he may exclaim, in the language of Addi&s;on,
<Q><L>'Tis not in mortals to command &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>But we'll do more, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpronius, we'll de&s;erve it.</L>
<BIBL>CATO.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is however a ju&s;t and a general ob&s;ervation, that
<PB N="92" REF="033585_0092_0FF7905AAEAD8238">
the ladies who labour too hard in the bu&s;ine&s;s of propa|gation, &s;eldom propagate much. This appears to be preci&s;ely the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; and, if every woman was as indefatigable in this bu&s;ine&s;s as Mrs. Er|rington, the king might 'lack &s;oldiers, and &s;ailors,' which would be a heavy lo&s;s at this moment.</P>
<P>Luke Carter comes forward next with his te&s;timony. He was al&s;o a &s;ervant to Mr. and Mrs. Errington. He &s;ays Captain Smith and his mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed to romp, play, and toy together; and goes upon the &s;ame ground as the re&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es; but &s;ays nothing new, except that the Captain u&s;ed to chuck his mi&s;tre&s;s under the chin, and gent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;queeze her hand. Luke appears to be an arch fellow, and &s;eems to have a particular allu&s;ion when he mentions the Captain's 'playing at chuck un|der the chin.' Probably it was at &s;ome con&s;iderable di&s;|tance <HI>under</HI> the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">!</P>
<P>Simon Orchard, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged &s;ixteen years, is the next wit|ne&s;s. He was foot-boy to Mr. Bran&s;ton, in Lyme-Re|gis, at a time when Mrs. Errington boarded there. He depo&s;es that, 'being one day in his ma&s;ter's parlour upon &s;ome errand, Mrs. Errington called him to her, and taking a book out of her pocket, &s;hewed him &s;everal in|decent pictures therein, exhibiting the private parts of both &s;exes, which &s;he particularly pointed out to him, and told him, &s;uch pictures were a repre&s;entation of the &s;everal methods in which gentle-folks and poor folks were connected together.</P>
<P>Mrs. Errington, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, had always an eye to bu&s;ine&s;s, and as poor &s;imple Simon was, at that time, only &s;ixteen years of age, &s;he was apprehen&s;ive that he might have been daunted, had &s;he proceeded in a more direct manner. She was determined, however, to have a reli&s;h of him, and her mode of angling for him was truly ingenious.</P>
<P>Simon proceeds with his evidence, and &s;ays that, 'a|bout two days afterwards, as one Mr. Daniel, an attor|ney's clerk in the town, was pa&s;&s;ing by on hor&s;eback, Mrs. Errington tapped again&s;t the parlour window, and
<PB N="93" REF="033585_0093_0FF7905F05C20790">
Mr. Daniel immediately alighted, tied up his hor&s;e at the door, and walked in; when Mrs. Errington met him at the door, and a&s;ked him to take a walk round the gar|den; and they accordingly walked together in the orch|ard behind the hou&s;e, and Simon afterwards &s;aw them &s;itting upon the gra&s;s; but, on their ob&s;erving him, &s;he came and beat him about the head for watching them, and then returned to Mr. Daniel.'</P>
<P>He then relates, that a Captain Roberts, and a Cap|tain Southby, had practi&s;ed great familiarities with Mrs. Errington, and from their having been &s;hut up in rooms together, he &s;uppo&s;es they at tho&s;e times committed adul|tery.</P>
<P>He next depo&s;es, that 'Mr. Trayte, po&s;tma&s;ter of Lyme, vi&s;ited Mrs. Errington, and they behaved with great familiarity to each other; that he &s;aw them play|ing in the orchard together; and, when Mrs. Errington ran round the trees, Mr. Trayte pur&s;ued her till &s;he fell down, and he then caught hold of her, and &s;he &s;aid he had hurt her leg, and pulled her petticoats above her knee; and Mr. Trayte put his hand upon her knee: that he then a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in getting up, and &s;he ran and fell again, and pulled up her petticoats nearly as high as &s;he had done before; that, about half an hourafter wards, they got into the kitchen together, and Mrs. Errington went into the &s;tore-room and fetched a &s;yringe, which Mr. Trayte took from her and filled it with water, and di&s;charged it under her petticoats."</P>
<P>This appears to have been a very extraordinary kind of amu&s;ement for Mr. Trayte. After having ju&s;t had two views above the lady's knee, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive why he &s;hould have recour&s;e to a pewter &s;quirt, and to di&s;charge the contents of it under her petticoats. He may be a tolerable good 'Po&s;tma&s;ter,' but he mu&s;t be a wretched 'wh&mdash;e-ma&s;ter,' not to think of a better expedi|ent to cool the lady's warm premi&s;es. Had either of her Captain's been then upon duty, they would have acted more 'en militaire.' The po&s;t ma&s;ter of Lyme-Regis &s;tands but a poor chance of obtaining a wife (if he has not already got one) for having worked an improper

'engine,' and treated a very 'reverend' looking figure with unbecoming levity.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a very cruel di&s;a&s;ter happened to poor Simon and &s;uch a one as fully retaliated for his watching Mr. Trayte and Mrs. Errington. The poor fellow de|po&s;es, that 'the next night as he was a&s;leep in his bed, he was waked by the bedcloaths being &s;triped off him, and ob&s;erved Mrs. Errington in her &s;hift only, and Phebe Lu&s;h, which then lived fellow &s;ervant with him, by his bed-&s;ide, and Mrs. Errington pulled up his &s;hirt and caught hold of his private parts, and pulled him out of bed by the &s;ame, and &s;aid &s;he would pull him down &s;tairs; but he at length got away from her by tearing down the bo&s;om of her &s;hift.'</P>
<P>Alas, poor Simon! If you had not been looked up|on as a youth of veracity, I &s;hould hardly have credit|ed &s;uch a tale; this being the fir&s;t time, by what I can learn, that Mrs. Errington attempted to treat &s;uch, 'mat|ters' with di&s;re&s;pect, much le&s;s with a degree of cruelty. But the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing part of this tran&s;action is, that, after having taken a 'thing in hand,' &s;he could ever think of quitting the room till &s;he had fini&s;hed it.&mdash;Perhaps &s;he is not fond of miniatures.</P>
<P>'The next night, continues ma&s;ter Simon, 'ju&s;t as he had undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oing into the bed, Mrs. Errington came into the room, and made him put on his breeches, and then took him down &s;tairs into her bed-chamber, and placed him under the bed&s;tead of his fellow-&s;ervant, Mary Mitchell, which &s;tood even with Mrs. Errington's bed, and bade him hide him&s;elf till the &s;aid Mary Mitchell &s;hould come to bed, and was gone to &s;leep, and that &s;he would then &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>But when the mi&s;tre&s;s and maid were undre&s;&s;ing to go to bed, the maid heard &s;omething breathe hard, and, by the help of the candle, &s;he di&s;covered poor Simon, and &s;ent him to his own bed.</P>
<P>Poor Simon mu&s;t have thought him&s;elf in a very whim|&s;ical &s;ituation, when placed under Mary Mitchell's bed|&s;tead. He was not &s;o entirely an infant, as not to be able
<PB N="95" REF="033585_0095_0FF79062590E5E20">
to form &s;ome imperfect idea of what Mrs. Errington meant, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he would '&s;peak to him after Mary Mitchell was gone to &s;leep.' Simon could not, at that early period be ignorant of the mode of ge&s;tation, though perhaps he had then only a theoretical knowledge of it; and he mu&s;t have been well convinced, that Mrs. Errington intended he &s;hould attempt the practical part. It &s;eems evident indeed, that Simon experienced tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations which &s;uch a &s;ituation mu&s;t naturally create, and that he was amply &s;upplied with materials to act the part of a man, or he would not &s;o readily and quiet|ly have complied with the lady's injunctions of crawling under the bed&s;tead, and to continue in that di&s;agreeable hiding-place, till &s;he ordered him to mount. In the words of the poet Mrs. Errington wanted.</P>
<Q>To teach the young idea how to &s;hoot.</Q>
<P>But it does not appear, from the evidence given that he was led out of the room in the &s;ame manner that he was taken out of bed by Mrs. Errington.</P>
<P>The next morning, a ma&s;ter Simon depo&s;es, 'he &s;aw Mrs. Errington &s;tanding before the fire with her petti|coats as high as her knees, in the pre&s;ence of Phebe Lu&s;h, Mary Mitchell, and his ma&s;ter's &s;on, who was then about five years of age, and, &s;eeing &s;ome hair lying upon a paper, a&s;ked what it was, and the little boy &s;aid Mrs. Errington had been cutting it off under her petti|coats; and then a&s;ked Mrs. Errington to give him &s;ome; when &s;he replied, if &s;he cut off any more, Mr. Errington would know it.'</P>
<P>Thus clo&s;es the evidence of ma&s;ter Simon: but there appears a deficiency in his depo&s;ition; for he does not mention a &s;yllable about the colour of this hair.</P>
<P>Mrs. Errington appears, upon all occa&s;ions, to con&s;i|der the propriety of her actions. She did not choo&s;e to part with a hair more, le&s;t it &s;hould be mi&s;&s;ed by her hu&s;band; but &s;he never thought it nece&s;&s;ary to refu&s;e tho&s;e favours that could not be mi&s;&s;ed by Mr. Erring|ton, though of ten thou&s;and times the value.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="033585_0096_0FF7906418583938">Phebe Lu&s;h is the next witne&s;s on the trial; &s;he cor|roborates what Simon Orchard had depo&s;ed, re&s;pecting the mode of Mrs. Errington's dragging him out of bed by the middle; &s;he al&s;o mentions Mrs. Errington's &s;hew|ing her &s;ome indecent pictures; and &s;he adds that, 'one day in the kitchen, &s;he, in a very indecent manner took up her petticoats, and, with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, cut off &s;ome hair from her private parts, and gave &s;ome to Mary Mitchell, and &s;ome to this deponent, and bade them keep it for her &s;ake; and, to the be&s;t of this deponent's re|memberance. Simon Orchard, the foot-boy, came into the kitchen whil&s;t &s;he was about it.'</P>
<P>It &s;eems perfectly clear, from what has been already advanced, that the fir&s;t tuft of hair which was generou&s;|ly be&s;towed by Mrs. Errington, to tho&s;e about her, was all taken from one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the premi&s;es; and the beard appearing afterward to be rather unequally divided, &s;he gave it a &s;econd 'mowing,' in order to bring matters in|to a due proportion and uniformity.</P>
<P>Mary Mitchell next &s;teps forward with her te&s;timony. She was cook to Mr. Bran&s;ton when Mrs. Errington boarded at his hou&s;e. She corroborates the evidence given by &s;everal others, and adds, that Mr. Clarke, one af|ternoon amu&s;ed him&s;elf with taking off Mrs. Errington's &s;tockings, and putting them on again, frequently ki&s;&s;ing her.'</P>
<P>This was a &s;trange kind of penchant of Mr. Clarke's! &mdash;'Pulling off her &s;tockings and putting them on again. It reminds us of Motteux, who tran&s;lated Don Quixote. He had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to women: but, as he advan|ced in years, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to art to give him ability as well as inclinations. We never heard, indeed, that he had recour&s;e to the ma|noeuvre of practi&s;ing upon legs and &s;tockings, like Mr. Clarke; but he had other methods equally extraordina|ry; and, at length, Nature became &s;o far debilitated, that nothing but hanging by the neck for a few moments, would give him that ela&s;ticity nece&s;&s;ary for con&s;umma|tion. Extraordinary as it may appear, he frequently &s;ubmitted to this operation, in order to procure a grati|fication,
<PB N="97" REF="033585_0097_0FF79069357800E8">
which, like Mrs. Errington, he con&s;idered as the only bu&s;ine&s;s worth attending to. At length, however, his life became a forfeit for his imprudence.&mdash;He was tuck'd up as u&s;ual in a two pair of &s;tairs room, in the pre|&s;ence of three 'filles des joye;' and, ju&s;t as he was &s;u&s;|pended, hearing that &s;ome dancing bears were perform|ing in the &s;treet, they all ran down to enjoy a &s;ight of the entertainment; and, forgetting, for a while, the &s;ituation in which they had left Mon&s;ieur Motteux; when they returned, they immediately cut him down, but he was totally incapacitated for bu&s;ine&s;s, and al&s;o dead! Thus al|&s;o, died the mu&s;ician KOTSWARRA, who&s;e exploits are &s;o brilliantly recorded in a new publication called Mo|dern Propen&s;ities.</P>
<P>Mary Mitchell mentions &s;everal particulars, which have already been fully related; and, further ob&s;erves, that, when Mrs. Errington &s;howed the ob&s;cene pictures, &s;he would talk in a very immode&s;t manner.</P>
<P>The &s;ame witne&s;s al&s;o &s;ays, that 'Captain Southby and Mrs. Errington being in a room together, &s;he tried at the door, and found it fa&s;tened, or locked within &s;ide; that Mrs. Errington called from within, and a&s;ked her what &s;he wanted; and Mary Mitchell told her the din|ner was ready; and &s;he told the deponent it mu&s;t wait, for &s;he was not ready for it yet; that, in the cour&s;e of half an hour more, Mrs. Errington and Captain South|by came out of the parlour, and the latter went immedi|ately away; that Mrs. Errington appeared quite heated, and looked confu&s;ed, and her hair and cap, and the hand|kerchief about her neck were in great di&s;order; that &s;he had no &s;tays on, being in her morning dre&s;s, which ap|peared very much tumbled.'&mdash;She adds that, '&s;he after|wards found the carpet much tumbled, and believes, from her con&s;cience, that the &s;aid parties had then the carnal knowledge of each other.</P>
<P>Mrs. Errington, it mu&s;t be admitted, paid but little attention to her dinners, when matters of more con&s;e|quence were tran&s;acting. We cannot ab&s;olutely &s;ay how &s;he was engaged while the repa&s;t was cooling, but
<PB N="98" REF="033585_0098_0FF7906AD3D78760">
we can give a &s;hrewd conjecture; and Molly Mitchell appears to favour our opinion. The Captain and &s;he, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, were taking a wet and a reli&s;h together; or he might probably be in&s;tructing her in &s;ome new evo|lutions, with the modern methods of attack and defence. She is a woman who thir&s;ted after knowledge, and if the Captain had any thing new to communicate, &s;he was &s;ure to pump him out of it. Polly Mitchell &s;uppo&s;es the Captain di&s;charged his mu&s;ket, for, though &s;he did not hear the report, &s;he &s;melt the powder; and Mrs. Erring|ton appeared to have been very much heated in the en|gagement.</P>
<P>The dinner was now cool, and Mrs. Errington, it is pre&s;umed, was equally &s;o; for &s;he &s;at down to table with as much indifference as if &s;he was retiring to bed with her hu&s;band. She picked a bit of the wing of a capon, without the lea&s;t appetite; though, but half an hour before, it is thought, &s;he had a mo&s;t voracious pro|pen&s;ity.</P>
<P>Molly Mitchell relates yet another &s;cene, which has not been depo&s;ed to by any of the other witne&s;&s;es. She &s;ays, that &s;he 'once attended Mrs. Errington to bathing, and, while &s;he was in the bathing machine, with only her &s;hift and petticoat on, &s;he called to a gentleman, who was a &s;tranger to this deponent, by the name of Love, and de&s;ired him to come in, which he did, and &s;taid about a quarter of an hour in the machine with her, and her bo|&s;om all the while was quite expo&s;ed to his &s;ight.'</P>
<P>The &s;ame witne&s;s corroborates the clipping &s;cene, and that 'Mrs. Errington gave her and Phebe Lu&s;h &s;ome hair in a paper, and told them to keep it for her &s;ake, and &s;ays, &s;he believes Mrs. Errington cut off &s;uch hair from her private parts.</P>
<P>Private parts &s;eems to be an improper term here, for what is meant to be under&s;tood by it! for, from the im|men&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s which appears to have been tran&s;acted there, Molly Mitchell would have expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with more propriety, if &s;he had called them her 'public parts.' But, perhaps, Polly is not cen&s;urable in this re&s;pect, as
<PB N="99" REF="033585_0099_0FF7906C6B2AA8C0">
the re&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es make u&s;e of the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion. The term, is probably technical, in Doctors Commons, and frequently occurs in their learned and elaborate di&s;|qui&s;itions. It is a &s;ubject often handled by the profe&s;&s;ors of eccle&s;ia&s;tical law; and every proctor is &s;o well ac|quainted with it, that (to u&s;e a figurative expre&s;&s;ion) it is a bu&s;ine&s;s that he has at his 'fingers ends.'</P>
<P>Towards the conclu&s;ion of Mary Mitchell's evidence &s;he &s;ays, with great gravity, 'that &s;he thinks Mrs. Erring|ton did not behave in a &s;ober, decent, mode&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Bran&s;ton, of Lyme-Regis, gentleman, depo&s;ed nothing that has not been already mentioned. But among other things, he &s;ays, that, 'as far as fell un|der his ob&s;ervation, Mr. Errington behaved to his wife with great tenderne&s;s and affection, in every re&s;pect, as a good hu&s;band.'</P>
<P>James Baxter another witne&s;s, &s;ays, 'he was watch|man and attendant on the officers on guard at the Bank of England, in the riots in June, 1780, and &s;till continues in the &s;ame &s;ituation; that Captain Buckley, of the Cold&s;tream regiment of guards, u&s;ed occa&s;ionally to do duty there; and that Mrs. Errington, towards the latter end of the year 1781, frequently vi&s;ited him when on duty, and laid with him all night in one and the &s;ame bed.'</P>
<P>Captain Buckley, it appearsby this, had double duty to perform, and he &s;uppo&s;ed he was as &s;afe as the Bank from di&s;covery; but ma&s;ter James Baxter, who had been engaged by the city to prevent riots, could not endure &s;uch riotous proceedings. He thought it an abominable offence, that people who were not free of the city, &s;hould come within the centre of its walls, to commit the foul crime of adultery. Had any one of the aldermen or com|mon council thought proper to amu&s;e him&s;elf with a lady on his premi&s;es, he would, perhaps, like a good citizen, have winked at it; but for people to bring their harlots from the We&s;tmin&s;ter end of the town, to defile the more pure city of London, was a matter which his con&s;cience would not permit him to conceal from the community.</P>

<P>At the age of fifteen, Mi&s;s Harriot &s;et her tender heart on a promi&s;ing youth; and &s;hewed much emotion and &s;en&s;ibility on occa&s;ion of his death, which was by bath|ing in the Thames.</P>
<P>In her &s;ixteenth year, the mo&s;t heedle&s;s &s;pectator might have run and read the language of her &s;u&s;ceptible &s;oul, in her &s;parkling eyes, comely &s;miles, and high heaving bo&s;om. The fragrance of &s;pring was not &s;o de|lightfull as her breath; the ro&s;es of &s;ummer bloomed in her cheeks. She aro&s;e to perfection, attracted the eyes of the gay and wanton youths; and grew the envy of her &s;ex. At nineteen, the fair one anticipated the &s;pringing plea&s;ures of the di&s;tant day, and longed to peep into the page of futurity.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Mi&s;s Harriot, accompained by her maid, vi&s;ited the gyp&s;ies of Norwood, and received from tho&s;e pretenders to &s;ooth-&s;aying, certain dark pre|dictions which highly plea&s;ed her fond imagination; be|holding a repre&s;entation of tho&s;e &s;cenes in which &s;he was to act a capital part.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the&s;e fal&s;e augurs pre&s;ented Mi&s;s a &s;pou&s;e who&s;e air and addre&s;s but ill accorded with her warm wi&s;hes; becau&s;e he appeared employed chiefly in in di&s;puting with the par&s;on about tythes; and engaged in a &s;tudy rather too dry for a lady of her vigorous and volatile deportment.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s Harriot, in due time be&s;towed her gentle hand on Mr. Errington, and made him happy in her charms; in time &s;he produced a pledge of their mutual love; or, to u&s;e the language of the law, 'They lived and cohabited together, bed and board, as hu&s;band and wife, and con|&s;ummated their marriage by the pro-creation of children.' So truly loving were they in their lives, during the fir&s;t twelve-months, that they might with a great degree of propriety have demanded the &s;litch of bacon at Dunmow. Happy, they dwelt on the banks of the &s;ilver Thames, in the plea&s;ant village of Batter&s;ea; and in that Ely&s;ium, might have long enjoyed the pure&s;t plea&s;ures, without a mixture of alloy, had not an in&s;inuating &s;erpent entered their paradi&s;e, and by his cunning, &s;educed this daughter of Eve, to ta&s;te the forbidden fruit, that grew in the 'middle' of the garden.</P>

<P>With all the re&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es, he affirmed, that Mrs. Levering u&s;ed frequently to call Gideon Ginchenet out of the work-&s;hop, and detain him for hours together; this was &s;o frequent in Mr. Le|vering's ab&s;ence, that on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the notice of the re&s;t of the men was &s;o much attracted, that they u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, "Come Gideon, your mi&s;tre&s;s wants you; &s;he cannot do without you."</P>
<P>John Healy an apprentice to Mr. Levering, &s;aid, that his mi&s;tre&s;s would frequently hurry him and another to bed, &s;aying Ginchenet &s;hould follow immediately; but which hardly ever occurred while they kept awake.&mdash;He had al&s;o &s;een them playing together in a manner that &s;hewed an un|common degree of intimacy; and in particular he had &s;een Ginchenet take hold of his mi&s;tre&s;s's hand in the kitchen and ki&s;s it, &s;he at the &s;ame time &s;uffer|ing

him to pull her about without finding the lea&s;t fault with him&mdash;&s;he at other times pulling his hair and &s;lapping his face. One night in particular, he remembered, that Mrs. Levering came into their bed-room with a candle in her hand, when Ginchenet got up in his &s;hirt and followed her; and this witne&s;s afterwards putting on his breeches, followed him into the kitchen, where he found Mrs. Levering, her daughter, and another little girl, but did not ob&s;erve any indecent familiarities between the parties at that time; on the contrary, Mrs. Levering affected to complain of Ginchenet's appearing before her in that manner; her daughter cried at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Another night, being in bed with Ginchenet, Mrs. Levering came into the room, and pulled the cloaths nearly off the former&mdash;Ginchenet then &s;aid, he would not go; on which &s;he left the room, and began crying as &s;oon as &s;he got to the door, &s;aying, he would repent it.&mdash;Yet, before &s;he went away, &s;he pulled the bed-cloaths off a &s;econd time, as low as their knees. It &s;eems, that Healy being awake when &s;he fir&s;t entered the room, he ob&s;erved the &s;hadow of her fingers again&s;t the wall, beckoning Ginchenet to follow her, which he was at fir&s;t de-determined to take no notice of.</P>
<P>Fanny Pounsford, wife of John Pounsford, one of Mr. Levering's journeymen, u&s;ed to attend Mr. Levering's children, at his hou&s;e in Gun-&s;treet, Spital-fields; &s;he &s;aid, Mrs. Levering was an aban|doned woman&mdash;&s;he knowing them &s;everal years, had ob&s;erved Mrs. Levering take great liberties with Ginchenet, while an apprentice, having him to dine, drink tea, and &s;up with her in Mr. Lever|ing's ab&s;ence; be&s;ides calling him out of the &s;hop at other times, to treat him with hot wine and other liquors, indulging him with getting him what he liked to eat&mdash;he, in return, u&s;ed to bring home tarts, &amp;c. to treat his mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;And as a proof of Mrs. Levering's in&s;atiable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he affirmed,
<PB N="105" REF="033585_0105_0FF7907DE3A01A18">
that &s;he had known her call Ginchenet ten times a day out of the &s;hop from his work; &s;he had likewi&s;e &s;een him ki&s;s her hand, and call her a pretty woman; at other times, he has attempted to take money out of her pocket, and on her hindering him, he has called her a &s;habby creature to her face, and the like.</P>
<P>Jane Hill, &s;ervant to Mr. Levering, went over the &s;ame evidence, adding, that &s;he heard her mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;ay in Ginchenet's pre&s;ence, that &s;he loved him and hated her hu&s;band; and that they were almo&s;t always playing together; and in fine, that one night in Mr. Levering's ab&s;ence, going into her mi&s;tre&s;s's room unawares, &s;he heard them in bed together. And that another time, Mr. Levering coming home rather unexpectedly, Ginchenet was in his wife's bed room, when he knocked at the door, and had much diffi|culty to get into his own apartment in his &s;hirt, be|fore Mr. Levering was let in.</P>
<P>Lucy Coleman another &s;ervant, te&s;tified, that Mrs. Levering was loo&s;e in her manners; and that &s;he owned to her, that &s;he doated on Ginchenet, and loved the ground he walked upon, and could live happier with him on a cru&s;t of bread, than with her hu&s;band upon thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Lucy Coleman further depo&s;ed, that one night when Gideon Ginchenet had come home from a journey, very much fatigued and gone to bed, &s;he was &s;ent out about eleven o'clock, for &s;ome beer, by her mi&s;tre&s;s, who ordered her not to knock at the &s;treet door on her return, as &s;he would wait for her and let her in; that on her return &s;he was much &s;urpri&s;ed on finding no per&s;on at the door, and more &s;o on &s;eeing a light in the counting-hou&s;e that was very near the pa&s;&s;age, towards which &s;he &s;aw a man, whom, at fir&s;t, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a robber, till &s;ee|ing him feel her mi&s;tre&s;s's brea&s;ts, and ki&s;s her, &s;he heard her &s;ay, "Don't Sadler! don't you &s;ee the girl?" They then went up &s;tairs, and the girl fol|lowed them towards the kitchen that was on the
<PB N="106" REF="033585_0106_0FF7907F79A9D358">
&s;ame floor; Mrs. Levering then a&s;ked him if he would have any &s;upper, to which he replied, No; but &s;aid he would drink &s;ome &s;mall beer&mdash;they then &s;taid in the kitchen half an hour, taking the &s;ame liberties as before; but as the man a&s;ked her mi&s;|tre&s;s to let him look at &s;ome needle-work in the dining-room, they both went in there, where they again ki&s;&s;ed one another: and as the witne&s;s found the door was open, and thought they did not hear her, &s;he looked into the room, and plainly &s;aw them &s;tanding clo&s;e together near the fire-place, Mr. Sadler with his back towards her, with his breeches quite hanging down, his hands round her mi&s;tre&s;s's wai&s;t, and his head at the &s;ame time in|clined upon her bo&s;om, while &s;he leaned her head upon his &s;houlders; &s;he at the &s;ame time &s;aw her cloaths &s;o far drawn up, as to di&s;cover part of her belly, and one of her thighs quite naked; but was prevented from making further ob&s;ervations, by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he heard &s;omething upon the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>In this depo&s;ition, &s;he had no doubt, but that the parties were then in the act of adultery together; neither were her &s;u&s;picions that &s;he heard &s;omebody upon the &s;tairs unfounded, for &s;he had not been long in the kitchen, before &s;he heard Mr. Levering call out and &s;ay, "I'll &s;hoot you, Sadler! I'll enter an action again&s;t you to-morrow." Mr. Sadler imme|mediately ran down &s;tairs, and Mr. Levering after him; but the other having &s;hut the &s;treet-door, he followed Mrs. Levering into the kitchen, &s;truck her, and &s;aid he would &s;hoot her.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, being determined &s;he &s;hould &s;tay no longer in his hou&s;e, he &s;ent for two watchman; but as they refu&s;ed to take charge of her, &s;he &s;lept with her maid that night, and went away to her brother's the next day.</P>
<P>This witne&s;s further proved, that &s;he brought a letter from Mrs. Levering, to Gideon Ginchenet, after this &s;eparation, which was opened by her hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="033585_0107_0FF7908140860498">Mrs. Levering, it &s;eems, had four children by her hu&s;band; and &s;eems to have had the culpabili|ty of her conduct increa&s;ed &s;o much the more, as her hu&s;band was of a temper the mo&s;t kind and in|dulgent.&mdash;There is hardly a doubt, from what may be collected from this trial, but that from her im|portunity with Ginchenet, and her publicity with Sadler, that &s;he was in a very &s;triking degree a Mrs. Errington in miniature.</P>
<P>A &s;entence from bed, board, and mutual coha|bition, was obtained in the u&s;ual way.</P>

<HEAD>Trial of John Curtis, a Publican, in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, London, for a Rape upon Sarah Tipple, Spin&s;ter, during the Old Bailey Se&s;&s;ions, in February, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es being examined &s;eparate, and Sa|rah Tipple Sworn, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;I am a &s;ingle woman, I go to &s;ervice; at the time of this a&s;&s;ault I lived &s;ervant with Mr. Curtis; and I am nineteen next Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>I went to my place to Mr. Curtis's on Monday, this affair happened on Tue&s;day. I was up three pair of &s;tairs making of the beds, and my ma&s;ter came up &s;tairs and bolted the door; he in&s;i&s;ted vio|lence upon me immediately.</P>
<P>Q. You mu&s;t explain&mdash;He entered my body; he took and threw me on to the bed, and I called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I &s;hrieked but once, and he put his hand and crammed the &s;heets into my mouth; as &s;oon as
<PB N="108" REF="033585_0108_0FF79084B42A7630">
he came into the room he bolted the door, he ne|ver &s;poke to me at all; he threw me on the bed without &s;peaking to me; he put his private parts into mine.</P>
<P>Q. What pa&s;&s;ed then, did you make any re&s;i&s;t|ance?&mdash;Yes.</P>
<P>Q. How did he manage to keep you down on the bed! did you re&s;i&s;t?&mdash;He forced me down, and he laid on me in &s;uch a manner, that I could not get away.</P>
<P>Q. Had you &s;tays on? I had a pair of &s;tays on.</P>
<P>Q. Did you make all the re&s;i&s;tance in your power? con&s;ider one hand was engaged at your mouth? I re&s;i&s;ted as much as I could.</P>
<P>Q. Did you try to do him any injury?&mdash;Yes, all that lay in my power. I could not get away at any rate in the world.</P>
<P>Q, What pa&s;t after he put his private parts into yours? How long might he be in that &s;ituation? How did he force him&s;elf on you? Did you &s;ee him take down his breeches?&mdash;He did that after he put his hand to my mouth, and then he forced his private parts into mine, and &s;omething warm came from him.</P>
<P>Q. During this time could not you make any re|&s;i&s;tance?&mdash;He put the &s;heet into my mouth, and I could not; I had done all that lay in my power.</P>
<P>Q. How long do you conceive he remained in that &s;ituation on your body?&mdash;Five minutes: After this was over he went out immediately and went and brought up &s;ome water; I was almo&s;t dead, and he brought up &s;ome water for me to drink, as I had fainted.</P>
<P>Q. What was your complaint?&mdash;I felt my&s;elf &s;o ill I could not get up; I was there about three weeks afterwards; I did not know a &s;oul in the world in London.</P>
<P>Q. When you did get up, whom did you find in the hou&s;e?&mdash;I did not get up for about two hours;
<PB N="109" REF="033585_0109_0FF7908898588370">
my ma&s;ter was in the hou&s;e, and the other partner too; there was a good many people in the tap-room, but I did not know them. There is a woman that lives up one pair of &s;tairs, but I did not know her at that time.</P>
<P>Q. When was it after this happened to you that you fir&s;t made any complaint?&mdash;I found my&s;elf very bad indeed, and I thought it might be becau&s;e I had never known any body before; at la&s;t I ap|plied to a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>Q. Did you not complain to your ma&s;ter of this ill-treatment?&mdash;No, I did not at all. But I went to live in Little-Mitre court, in Fenchurch-&s;treet, I was &s;o bad I could not &s;tay; after I found I had the bad di&s;temper I a&s;ked the pri&s;oner, my ma&s;ter, to get me into the ho&s;pital, and he &s;ent a con&s;table to take me up, I had left him a long time before I found out that I was &s;o; about nine weeks.</P>
<P>Q. Did you tell him he had committed a rape on you?&mdash;I did not know any thing about committing a rape; all I a&s;ked of him was to get me into the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Q. Will you &s;wear upon your oath that you have never known him but that one time?&mdash;I never had any connection with him but then: he &s;ent for a con&s;table and took me up; he &s;aid I in&s;ulted him for money, but I did not.</P>
<P>Q. What an&s;wer did he make to that?&mdash;I did not hear him &s;ay &s;o, the con&s;table told me &s;o; the con|&s;table came and told me I mu&s;t go along with him, and he took me to the Compter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Knowlys.</HI> Now my girl tell us a little more about this: There was a man of the name of Potts that lodged in the hou&s;e?&mdash;There was.</P>
<P>Q. Did not the other two &s;ervants &s;ay, you was very fond of Potts.&mdash;They did &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. Did not Hannah, one of them, &s;ay you &s;ome|times got out of bed and cuddled Potts. Young woman was not you turned out of doors for being found in bed with Potts?&mdash;I was not.</P>

<P>Q. You had never known any thing of this &s;ort before?&mdash;Never before in my life.</P>
<P>Q. Which part of the bed did you fall again&s;t? &mdash;It was the &s;ide of the bed near the foot, and my head towards the other &s;ide,</P>
<P>Q. When he threw you on the bed, I &s;uppo&s;e you &s;u&s;pected his intention?&mdash;I did, and &s;hrieked out.</P>
<P>Q. You never &s;hrieked out more than once?&mdash;He put the &s;heet into my mouth, immediately cram|med it in; the &s;heet was in my mouth all the time of the bu&s;ine&s;s, he was holding it down with his hand.</P>
<P>Q. Then he had only one hand at liberty, for one hand was con&s;tantly employed in keeping down the &s;heet in your mouth; that was &s;o?&mdash;It was.</P>
<P>Q. How was your two hands employed again&s;t his one?&mdash;My two hands were behind me.</P>
<P>Q. Pray, who was it put your hands in that &s;hape?&mdash;Seeing him bar the door, I was frightened, and I held my hands &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. You &s;u&s;pected, when you &s;aw him bar the door? I did not know what he was going to do, I thought he was going to kill me, or &s;omething, I cried out, and he immediately chucked me on the bed.</P>
<P>Q. Then he &s;hoved you on the bed the moment that he barred the door; how far is the bed from the door?&mdash;It is clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Then you had time to make one cry and no more; how came your hands to fall behind you? &mdash;I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. That was rather odd, was not it; did you ever in your life when you fell, having your hands

clo&s;e by your &s;ide, had your hands behind you be|fore; how could they be twi&s;ted backwards by that fall?&mdash;I cannot tell.</P>

<P>Q. They then remained pinioned like a fowl?&mdash; Exactly &s;o; he prevented me, he lay on me.</P>
<P>Q. The man is not two or three ton weight?&mdash; I made all the re&s;i&s;tance I po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Q. How could he by laying on you prevent your drawing one hand from under you?&mdash;I made all the re&s;i&s;tance I could.</P>
<P>Q. Then you really could not get one hand from under your back; that man is not a very fat man?&mdash;The moment I &s;aw him bar the door, the moment my &s;trength failed me directly. I being in a &s;trange place, what did I &s;uppo&s;e that that man was going to do!</P>
<P>Q. Did you &s;lap his face?&mdash;I did not.</P>
<P>Q. Did you pull his hair?&mdash;I could not get a|way.</P>
<P>Q. Did you kick him at all?&mdash;I kicked him all that lay in my power.</P>
<P>Q. Then you almo&s;t overturned him by your kicking?&mdash;I don't know, I cannot &s;ay but what I might.</P>
<P>Q. Here he lays on you, and you kicking about, it is natural you &s;hould almo&s;t overturn him?&mdash;I did all that was in my power.</P>

<P>Q. How did you try to get up; the moment that you fell down, he threw him&s;elf upon you; where was your petticoats?&mdash;He pulled up my petti|coats.</P>

<P><PB N="112" REF="033585_0112_0FF79090AD700CB0">Q. How did he manage with his other hand?&mdash; And then he laid his knee on me, and in that &s;itu|ation he lay on me; he kept my petticoats high up with his knee.</P>
<P>Q. And in that &s;ituation he did it?&mdash;No, he did not do it &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. What did he do with his knee?&mdash;After he pulled up my petticoats he laid his knee on me to keep them up while he pulled down his breeches.</P>
<P>Q. He continued his knee there then?&mdash;No, he did not.</P>
<P>Q. What kept your coats up?&mdash;He took his knee up when he unbuttoned his breeches; he was on the bed, and my coats kept up.</P>
<P>Q. Did they keep up of their own accord, or did you keep them up?&mdash;He kept them up, to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>Q. Now, how did he keep them up?&mdash;he had not three hands, had he?&mdash;No.</P>
<P>Q. Now, let us di&s;po&s;e of the two; how did he keep them up?&mdash;I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Q. How high were your clothes?&mdash;My clothes were quite up to my chin.</P>
<P>Q. And you &s;truggled and kicked about a good deal, did not you?&mdash;All that lay in my power.</P>
<P>Q. Still they kept up to your chin; you was quite a maid at this time?&mdash;I never knew a man before.</P>
<P>Q. Will you tell us how he managed to bring his private parts to your's? can you &s;ay how he did that?&mdash;No.</P>
<P>Q. Did you cro&s;s your legs?&mdash;No.</P>

<P>Q. Cannot you tell me how he managed to in|troduce his private parts to you, becau&s;e you know you was a maid?&mdash;No.</P>
<P>Q. Nor where his hand was? was it employed to prevent your &s;truggling?&mdash;He laid on me.</P>
<P>Q. Really, my girl, in the way you de&s;cribe it, I cannot &s;ee how &s;uch a thing could be effected?&mdash; He certainly did.</P>

<P>Q. Never felt it about your per&s;on at all?&mdash; Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Then how was it employed?&mdash;He took his other hand to put his private parts into mine.</P>

<P>Q. When one hand was on your mouth, and the other hand was &s;o employed, a very little &s;trug|gle would have put him off; how came it you did not get rid of him when both hands were engaged? &mdash;I did all in my power.</P>
<P>Q. Did he continue this hand to his private parts all the time that he did this to you?&mdash;No, not all the time.</P>
<P>Q. How did he employ it afterwards?&mdash;I cannot tell you, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>Q. How came you to tell nobody of this affair? &mdash;I had no friends nor any acquaintance in London or el&s;e I would have told them.</P>

<HEAD>The Ca&s;e of John Bury, E&s;q. of the County of Devon, who was divorced for want of his Te&s;ticles. Tried in 1561.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN BURY, E&s;q. was a man of con&s;iderable lan|ded e&s;tate, which principally lay in the county of Devon, where he re&s;ided. Being at length tired of a &s;ingle life, he re&s;olved to enter on the holy &s;tate of matrimony; and for this purpo&s;e, paid his addre&s;&s;es, and &s;hortly after mar|ried, one Willimot Gifford, of the &s;ame county; a lady
<PB N="116" REF="033585_0116_0FF7909ACA848140">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing many per&s;onal charms. The marriage took place the 20th of November, in the fir&s;t year of Queen Mary.</P>
<P>The bride, who felt all the force of nature, was much &s;urprized when the next morning came, to find that her hu&s;band had ri&s;en, and that nothing of a very tender concern had occurred; but &s;he concluded, that his extreme re&s;|pect for her had prevented him from taking the la&s;t liberty in a precipitate manner; and con&s;oled her&s;elf, that &s;he was to be initiated into the my&s;teries of Hymen by degrees. The next night, however, proved equally, if not more, un&s;atisfactory as the former; for the round-a-bout en|dearments which he be&s;towed, only made her the more de&s;irous of an in&s;tant explanation. Delicacy forbade her to point the way; or certain it is, that &s;he would have compelled him to di&s;charge the duties of his &s;tation. Days, and weeks, and months and years, pa&s;&s;ed on ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner: they went to bed to repo&s;e, and ro&s;e again to follow the bu&s;ine&s;s, or the plea&s;ures of the day. Let us for a moment pity a blooming young lady, in the height of blood and vigour, married to a man who could not deprive her of that virgin mark which &s;he had pre|&s;erved with much care, for heightening his opinion, and for adding to the common &s;tock of love: and while we commi&s;erate, let us not blame her for communicating her deplorable &s;ituation to a female confidant. This confidant was a mother, who de&s;cribed to her all the pro|ce&s;s of the tender communication between man and wife: now were the eyes of poor Willimot opened, her indignation was ju&s;tly rai&s;ed, and &s;he very properly de|termined to call her un-family hu&s;band before the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Judge, charging him to be 'impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta Willimote, propter vitium perpe|tuum, &amp; incurabile impendimentum ad generationem, &amp; ejus inhabilitatem;' and therefore de&s;iring to be divor|ced.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this charge, &s;everal witne&s;&s;es were cal|led, two of whom were phy&s;icians: the&s;e unravelled the whole my&s;tery, by declaring, that the &s;aid J. Bury, E&s;q,
<PB N="117" REF="033585_0117_0FF7909C617B1738">
had but one little &s;tone about the &s;ize of a bean. In further proof it was a&s;&s;erted by &s;everal experienced ma|trons, that Willimot was at that time a virgin, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word. The&s;e facts were of &s;o &s;trong a na|ture, that Bury, at length, made a full confe&s;&s;ion; on which the Judge pronounced a &s;entence of divorce.</P>
<P>But what mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed us&mdash;and, what no doubt, will mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h our readers&mdash;was, the circum&s;tance that this impotent man &s;hould, &s;ome &s;hort time after|wards, marry another woman called Philip Monjoy, and that &s;he &s;hould be delivered of a &s;on by him! Perhaps this event favours as &s;trongly of Cuckoldom, as any other in the annals of gallantry: for, notwith&s;tanding this au&s;|picious birth, we find an interruption of matrimonial joys occurred in a &s;hort &s;pace of time; Mrs. Monjoy, without appealing to the laws&mdash;perhaps &s;he could not go into Court with clean hands&mdash;precipitately left her hu&s;band, and married a Mr. Langeden, with whom &s;he ever after continued.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, perhaps, not unrea&s;onable to conclude that Bury had been cornuted by Langeden, to whom the birth of the &s;on may be attributed. In Bury's dole|ful &s;ituation, he no doubt con&s;idered the affair as a piece of friend&s;hip: and, on the other hand, if he took the atchievement to him&s;elf, it mu&s;t wonderfully have con|tributed to the good gentleman's peace of mind: for though on his examination at the &s;uit of his fir&s;t wife, he acknowledged that &s;he was a virgin, for aught he knew to the contrary; it is not impo&s;&s;ible but the Graham or the Forman of that day, might have fleeced his pur&s;e, on the pretence of removing his unfortunate defect.</P>

<HEAD>Trial of the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, Wife of the Hon. Edward Foley, E&s;q. and Daughter of Willi|am Earl of Coventry, for Adultery with the Right Hon. Charles Henry Earl of Peterborough, in the Con&s;i&s;|torial and Epi&s;copal Court at Doc|tor's Commons.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance of licentious wickedne&s;s, and infamous indifference to public opinion, almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any preceding relation, in &s;candalous and bare-faced de|fiance of every &s;entiment of decency!</P>
<P>The Libel exhibited before the Epi&s;copal Court, &s;tated the marriage of the Hon. Edward Foley, and the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, the then Right Hon. La|day Ann Coventry, on the 24th of October, 1778: the nece&s;&s;ary documents were produced and properly au|thenticated. Mr. Foley and his Lady, lived together with every affection on his part, and were commonly reputed, taken, and acknowledged to be man and wife by their relations, neighbours, and acquaintance; about the latter end of the month of November, 1783, Lady Foley &s;et out for London, and went to the hou&s;e of Mi&s;s Fo|ley, in Chandos-&s;treet, to make preparations for a jour|ney to the Continent; and Mr. Foley intended to fol|low her to London, but having been informed that a cri|minal intimacy had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and was &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between his wife and the Earl of Peterborough, he declined his intention, and immediately &s;eparated him&s;elf from union and company with Lady Foley.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time in the year 1781, that Lord Deer|hur&s;t, brother to lady Foley, introduced the Earl of
<PB N="119" REF="033585_0119_0FF7909FD59281B8">
Peterborough to the acquaintance and friend&s;hip, and into the hou&s;e, of Mr. Foley, and from that time a &s;trong intimacy continued: in or near the months of Ja|nuary, February, and March, 1782, whil&s;t Mr. Foley re&s;ided in Weymouth-&s;treet, the Earl of Peterborough frequently paid morning vi&s;its to, and dined with, Mr. Foley and Lady Foley his wife, and was always enter|tained by Mr. Foley, in the mo&s;t friendly and ho&s;pitable way: about the month of April 1783, the Earl of Pe|terborough returned from the Continent; Mr. Foley then lived in Somer&s;et-&s;treet, and his Lord&s;hip there re|newed his intimacy and vi&s;its to Mr. Foley and his wife: the latter, in Augu&s;t 1783, came from Hereford&s;hire to London, and went to live at the hou&s;e of the Hon. Mi&s;s Foley in Chandos-&s;treet; here al&s;o they were frequently vi&s;ited by the Earl of Peterborough: after this they went to Ha&s;tings, accompanied by Lord Peterborough, and from thence to Brighthelm&s;tone, where his Lord&s;hip &s;taid but one day: in November en&s;uing, Mr. Foley and Lady Foley returned to London, to a hou&s;e in South-&s;treet, where his Lord&s;hip was very frequent in his attendance: about the latter end of April 1784, Lord Peterborough went to Cheltenham in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, for the benefit of his health, as he pretended, and from that place wrote to Mr. Foley, at Stoke Court, in Hereford&s;hire, about 30 miles di&s;tant, enquiring after his and Lady Foley's health: and Mr. Foley had not then the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion that any thing criminal &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between lady Foley and him: an invitation was &s;hortly &s;ent to his Lord&s;hip, to come and &s;pend &s;ome time at Stoke Court, which invitation he accepted, and in May 1784, paid his fir&s;t vi&s;it to Mr. Foley and Lady Foley at Stoke Court, and from that time until about the Second of September 1784, his Lord&s;hip &s;everal times vi&s;ited them there for the cour&s;e of a few days, and then returned to Cheltenham: about the &s;econd of Sep|tember, he came back to Stoke Court, with his &s;ervants and hor&s;es, and continued entirely to re&s;ide there till about the 20th: Lord Peterborough having thus, by
<PB N="120" REF="033585_0120_0FF790A3D52813A0">
various acts, e&s;tabli&s;hed an intimacy in Mr. Foley's fa|mily, and taken opportunity thereby to &s;educe the affec|tions of Lady Foley from her hu&s;band, &s;he being a wo|man of a profligate and adulterous di&s;po&s;ition, they did mutually carry on a wicked and criminal corre&s;pondence, which continued to be a matter of great notoriety.</P>
<P>About the month of March 1784, Mr. Foley and Lady Ann Foley his wife, went to a ball given by his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of Wales, at Carleton Hou&s;e. Mr. Foley did not &s;tay long at Carleton Hou&s;e, but re|tired and left Lady Foley there, who &s;taid till about four or five the next morning, and then left Carleton Hou&s;e in Mr. Foley's coach, accompanied by the Earl of Pe|terborough, and no per&s;on be&s;ides; his Lord&s;hip order|ed the coachman, Thomas Simmonds, to drive to his Lord&s;hip's mother's hou&s;e, in Dean-&s;treet, Soho, which he accordingly did; when they arrived there, the Earl of Peterborough ordered Thomas Andrews, the footman not to knock at the door, and Thomas Simmonds &s;taid on the coach box; the blinds of the coach were drawn up, and they &s;topped in that &s;ituation about an hour: during that time the coachman and footman perceived the coach to be in motion &s;everal times, though the hor&s;es &s;tood quite &s;till; the coachman, as he &s;at on the box, looked through the front window of the coach, and the morning being remarkably fine, and the moon &s;hining &s;o clear as al|mo&s;t to equal the light of day, he plainly &s;aw the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley laying upon her back, upon the back &s;eat of the &s;aid coach, with her naked thighs ex|po&s;ed, and Lord Peterborough laying upon her, and be|tween her naked thighs, and they were then in the very act of carnal copulation; and the motion of the coach was occa&s;ioned thereby.</P>
<P>Frequently, at other times, in the winter of the year 1783, and the &s;pring of the year 1784, Thomas Sim|monds the coachman, hath, at nights, drove the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, and the Earl of Peterborough, in Mr. Foley's coach, about the &s;treets of London, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oachman hath, by his Lord&s;hip's order, &s;topt many
<PB N="121" REF="033585_0121_0FF790A696EE5C80">
times; the blinds have been pulled up, and Lady Ann and the Earl have had the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies, and committed the crime of Adul|tery: in May 1784, when his Lord&s;hip was at Mr. Fo|ley's hou&s;e at Stoke Court, William Maull, ma&s;ter of the Crown Inn, at Worce&s;ter, by order of Mr. Foley, &s;ent his &s;ervant, Benjamin Smith, with a pair of job|hor&s;es, for the u&s;e of his carriage; about three weeks af|ter Benjamin Smith went to Stoke Court with the job|hor&s;es, he drove Lady Foley and Lord Peterborough alone together, in his Lord&s;hip's coach, about two miles from Stoke Court, near Ea&s;twood, in the turnpike road to Sudbury; and as he was driving the carriage gently up hill, he looked through the front window of the coach, and plainly perceived Lady Foley laying on her back, on the bench in the coach, with her thighs naked, (the coach had a large double window in the front, and a nar|row bench within, to communicate from one &s;eat to the other) and extended and expo&s;ed towards his &s;ight, and Lord Peterborough was then laying upon her, in the very act of carnal copulation, and continued in that po|&s;ition &s;everal minutes, thus having the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies, and committing the crime of Adultery. After his Lord&s;hp and Lady Ann had left the coach, Benjamin Smith found, in one of the pockets thereof, a white handkerchief, with &s;everal marks or &s;tains thereon, and which had been u&s;ed by Lord Pe|terborough and Lady Foley, or by one of them, to wipe their, or one of their private parts.</P>
<P>Shortly after this occurrence, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and his Lord&s;hip in a phaeton, to the top of Stoke Park, near the double gates there, where Lord Peterborough ordered him to &s;top; getting out of the phaeton, his Lord&s;hip propo&s;ed a walk to Lady Ann, upon which &s;he left the carriage, and they walked to|gether about fifty yards from the place where the car|riage &s;tood, and then Lady Ann laid her&s;elf down on the gra&s;s near &s;ome gor&s;e; his Lord&s;hip upon this di|rectly unbuttoned his breeches, and pulled up her petti|coats,
<PB N="122" REF="033585_0122_0FF790A82F3DA4A8">
and laid down upon her; and they had there the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies: they continued on the ground together about ten minutes, and, during that time, they were perceived by Benjamin Smith with the utmo&s;t clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the en&s;uing day, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and the Earl, in the phaeton, to the top of Stoke Park, near the double gates there, and clo&s;e to the &s;pot they were at the day before; here he &s;topped by Lord Peterborough's orders, and Lady Ann and his Lord&s;hip de&s;cending from the phaeton, walked on together for the &s;pace of one hundred yards among the trees; there they &s;topped, and Lady Ann put her back to and leaned again&s;t an oak tree, and either &s;he or Lord Peterborough pulled her petticoats up to her wai&s;t, and thereby expo|&s;ed her naked thighs; his Lord&s;hip then pulled down his breeches and got between her legs and thighs, and then carnally enjoyed her there, leaning again&s;t the oak-tree, they had the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each others bo|dies, and committed the foul crime of adultery, which fact was clearly &s;een by Benjamin Smith, and J. Hookey, Lord Peterborough's &s;ervant.</P>
<P>One day, &s;ome time between May and September 1784, Benjamin Smith drove Lady Ann and his Lord|&s;hip in a phaeton, on the turnpike road from Stoke Court, to the city of Hereford; during the journey, he per|ceived Lady Ann with her petticoats up &s;itting in the &s;aid Lord Peterborough's lap, who&s;e breeches were down and her hand therein, and on his Lord&s;hip ob&s;erving that Benjamin Smith noticed it, he &s;aid, Po&s;tboy, mind your hor&s;es, and don't look at us!</P>
<P>On Friday the 9th. of July 1784, Lady Ann Foley and Lord Peterborough had a meeting, and agreed to continue their criminal intimacy on the en&s;uing Sunday; the next Monday was the day fixed for the election of Members of Parliament, for the city of Hereford, and on Saturday the 10th, being the Saturday before the election. Lord Peterborough &s;ent a letter to Lady Ann Foley, intimating therein, that he had repented having
<PB N="123" REF="033585_0123_0FF790AA4DABBD98">
appointed Sunday for their interview; that he thought Mr. Foley's arrival on the next day a certainty, as the Hereford election would be on Monday; that, his Lord|&s;hip conceived, would be a more eligible day, as her Lady&s;hip would be certain of Mr. Foley's ab&s;ence; in conclu&s;ion, his Lord&s;hip named the three-mile &s;tone from Ledbury, as the place, and Monday at half after five as the time of meeting.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 30th September, 1784, Lady Ann Foley and Lord Peterborough were together in a walk in the &s;hrubbery, near the grotto, in Mr. Foley's grounds, at Stoke Court, and his Lord&s;hip was &s;tanding with La|dy Ann in his arms; her arms were round his neck, and her legs round his, with her cloaths up to her wai&s;t, and her nakedne&s;s expo&s;ed from the wai&s;t downwards; his arms were round her body, and both their bodies in mo|tion, and they were then in the very act of carnal copu|lation, and then had the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies, and thereby committed the foul crime of adultery: all this was plainly &s;een by John Davies, a a bricklaye, who had been that day employed in pul|ling down a pigeon-hou&s;e in Stoke Park, and was re|turning from his work, and walking along the road, pa|rellel with the &s;aid &s;hrubbery; he heard Lady Ann Fo|ley cry out three times, 'Oh dear," and &s;ay, 'you hurt me!" All this was a matter of public notoriety.</P>
<P>Samuel Purlewent, of Lincoln's Inn, Gentleman, pro|ved the marriage of the Hon. Mr. Foley and the Right Hon. Lady Ann. Foley. Mr. Purlewent was employed as agent by Mr. Foley's attorney, Mr. White, and &s;aid, that in Hillary Term la&s;t, Edward Foley brought his action in his Maje&s;ty's Court of King's Bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, again&s;t the Right Hon. Charles Henry Earl of Peterbo|rough and Monmouth, for damages &s;u&s;tained by rea&s;on of a criminal corre&s;pondence carried on by the Earl, with Lady Ann Foley, the wife of Edward Foley: in the month of March in the year 1785, the cau&s;e came on to be heard at the A&s;&s;izes held at the city of Hereford, before Sir George Nares, Knt. and Sir James Eyre, Knt.
<PB N="124" REF="033585_0124_0FF790AE4C5B8360">
and a Jury of lawful and hone&s;t men, duly impannelled and &s;worn, at which A&s;&s;izes the deponent was pre&s;ent; when the Jury having heard the evidence, brought in a verdict for the Hon. Edward Foley, the plaintiff, with two thou&s;and five hundred pounds damages. Mr. Pur|levent al&s;o depo&s;ed to the authenticity of a copy of the verdict exhibited; and al&s;o to the identity of the per&s;ons of the Hon. Edward Foley, the Right Hon. Lady Ann Foley, and Charles Henry Earl of Peterborough and Monmouth,</P>
<P>John Robin&s;on, of Bolton-&s;treet, Piccadilly, Gentle|man, depo&s;ed to the hand-writing of the Earl of Peterbo|rough; what appears &s;ingular is, that this gentleman does not affix the &s;ignature of his name, but his mark to his depo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This was the whole of the evidence adduced; upon the hearing of which the Court adjudged, that a defini|tive &s;entence be promulgated; viz. it was therefore pro|nounced and decreed, that the Hon. Edward Foley, E&s;q. &s;hould be divorced, &amp;c. from bed, board, and mutual cohabition with his wife, by rea&s;on of Adultery by her committed.</P>
<P>Surely the &s;candalous &s;cenes here related, could not have been exceeded by any of the &s;hocking enormities committed by the great and noble, during the licentious reign of our &s;econd Charles! what an admirable &s;cheme, on the return from Carlton Hou&s;e, was that of Lord Pe|terborough's ordering the coach to proceed to his mo|ther's hou&s;e in Dean-&s;treet, and there to &s;tand &s;till, while the amorous pair, 'hot with the Tu&s;can grape, and high in blood,' (and inflamed her Lady&s;hip perhaps had been by &s;ome liquor, during her &s;tay at Carlton Hou&s;e) enjoy|ed them&s;elves in &s;oft daliance: it is curious to con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the &s;ervants on the coach-box, their &s;ur|pri&s;e on hearing his Lord&s;hip's order to let the coach <HI>&s;tand &s;till</HI> in the &s;treet; they might po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e it was their intention to <HI>repo&s;e</HI> &s;ome little &s;pace in that &s;itu|ation: the chuckling and grinning, and broken hints of tho&s;e candid interpreters of awkward &s;ituations, livery
<PB N="125" REF="033585_0125_0FF790B0EA69C1F0">
&s;ervants, may however, be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at; and then how mu&s;t the philo&s;ophy of Thomas Simmonds, the coachman, have been puzzled, at &s;eeing the coach move, while the hor&s;es &s;tood perfectly &s;till, till venturing to look through the window, he, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the light of the moon, perceived that memorable &s;cene &s;o highly complimentary to the delicacy of modern manners, and &s;o peculiarly honourable to the character of her Lady&s;hip as a wife, and the feelings of his Lord&s;hip as a friend! How would the good old Lady have been affected, had &s;he known the &s;cene of wickedne&s;s her &s;on was tran&s;acting at her door! Perhaps &s;he was at that very moment, offering &s;ome prayer for &s;trengthening the religious and moral principles of his Lord&s;hip!</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;cenes, it appeared, frequently occurred in the &s;treets of London, and they &s;eem freaks of the imagina|tion, this amiable couple mu&s;t have been very partial to; but the country was a place more adapted to this mode of indulgence; in bye-roads, &amp;c. the favourite propen|&s;ity might be humoured, without much hazard of de|tection, except from the curio&s;ity of the driver, which was an evil to be feared alike in every place; thus driving gently up hill near Sudbury, the po&s;tillion perceived them in the la&s;t expo&s;ure of &s;hamele&s;s guilt, nor mu&s;t the &s;cenes where Lady Ann reclines her&s;elf on the gra&s;s, or leans her&s;elf back again&s;t the oak-tree, be left unnoticed, though fit only to grace the annals of vulgar pro&s;titution. The&s;e circum&s;tances according to the evidence of the po&s;tilion, happened about the month of May; the Spec|tor &s;omewhere, advi&s;es his fair readers again&s;t too great an intimacy with Sylvan &s;cenes in that month; but had the high-bred dames of fa&s;hion, of that period, even degraded them&s;elves by ob&s;cenities like tho&s;e we have been obliged to relate, that cen&s;or of the public morals would, perhaps, almo&s;t have de&s;paired of the efficacy of precept, and have vented his &s;entiments only, in indignant exclamation, or contemptuous &s;arcar&s;in.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t her Lady&s;hip's feelings and &s;entiments have been, when his Lord&s;hip admoni&s;hed the po&s;tilion, on
<PB N="126" REF="033585_0126_0FF790B28A712438">
his looking at them, to mind his hor&s;es, and not the em|ployment of the company he was driving! O virtuous education, pride of birth, female dignity and delicacy, how were ye all degraded, lo&s;t! the meane&s;t wretch could not have &s;tooped to lower infamy. Imperial Rome we will no longer &s;urvey as prodigies, thy Agrippina's, Me&s;&s;alina's, &amp;c. England can vie with thee in &s;ome of thy mo&s;t profligate exhibitions of moral evil.</P>
<P>The occurrences of this Trial, indeed, only take the lead of numberle&s;s others of equal atrocity; &s;ome more heightened by wantonne&s;s, and more caricatured by burle&s;que: the utmo&s;t impartiality, the &s;tricte&s;t adhe|rence to truth, will be ob&s;erved in every narration; no favour will be allowed to rank or influence, nor will an already degraded name be cru&s;hed by unmerited obloquy: as our materials are drawn from the mo&s;t authentic &s;ources our means of information are unbounded; it is to the public we write, and, therefore, truth and candour will ever be the grand directors of our compo&s;itions.</P>

The fir&s;t legal &s;tep taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s, was to have a form of interrogation drawn up (and this was partly done by the commands of the lady's confe&s;&s;ors) The lady in her charge, does not tax her hu&s;band with the want of the organs nece&s;&s;ary for generation; but only urges, that the&s;e organs are ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of mo|tion. This kind of imbecility, is what the Canons call <HI>frigidity.</HI></P>
<P>When the Marquis was interrogated by the proper of|ficers, he readily an&s;wered every que&s;tion but that, a&s;k|ing

<P>The Report made in pur&s;uance of an Order of Court.</P>
<P>We have, in a &s;pecial manner, examined the exterior genital parts of the Marquis de Ge&s;vres: we have ob|&s;erved, that he is advantageou&s;ly provided with all his parts, having their natural con&s;i&s;tence, colour, dimen|&s;ion, and figure. But, becau&s;e erection accompanied with firmne&s;s and &s;ome duration, is al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary towards proving the virile power; and we did not ob&s;erve any &s;uch thing in him, during our in&s;pection, we &s;u&s;pend our judgment touching his potency. We do not, however, infer, that there is impotency in him, from our not having &s;een that token of virility; becau&s;e it does not always appear, and there are men, to whom the pre&s;ence of other men is an ob&s;tacle to the appear|ance of &s;uch a token.

<P><PB N="138" REF="033585_0138_0FF790D295B626B8">Upon this acknowledged perfection of the parts, with re&s;pect to figure only, did the Marquis move for the non &s;uitment of his wife; but again&s;t him it was expre&s;sly pleaded by the lady<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s advocate, that conformation alone, or the natural &s;hape of the penis, is only a condition <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI>; and that nothing was clearer than the po&s;i|tion, "that figure and motion do not always meet in one and the &s;ame &s;ubject.&mdash;There may be motion without figure, and figure without motion&mdash;what proves the lat|ter beyond a doubt is, that the canon law has ab&s;olutely two different chapters, one entitled, <HI>de Frigidis</HI> of the cold, the other <HI>de Maleficiatis,</HI> of the ill-made. Tho&s;e men, like the Marquis, it is evident, are called the <HI>frigid;</HI> but the operations of the ill-made, were &s;uppo|&s;ed to be hindered by &s;orcery.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve, that in ca&s;es of impotency, in one of the parties, canons recommend cha&s;tity to both! The canon we allude to, was made under Gregory I. but Gregory II. who &s;ucceeded him, was too wi&s;e to lay any re&s;traint upon a woman's &s;uing for a divorce; he contented him&s;elf by &s;imply recommending the hu&s;|band of an ill-organized wife, to turn the conjugal life into a fraternal one. Yet, per&s;uaded that every body has not the gift of continency he concludes his di&s;cour&s;e with the&s;e words: <HI>Sed quia hoc magnorum e&s;t, &s;i non po|te&s;t &s;e continere, nubat.</HI> But, becau&s;e this is a great un|dertaking, if a per&s;on cannot contain him&s;elf he may marry again. The &s;ame thing that he allowed to the hu&s;|band of a di&s;abled wife, he granted to the wife of an im|potent hu&s;band, and the decrees of this pontiff are in ge|neral adhered to, at this pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>But to return to the con&s;ideration of what it is that con&s;titutes the characters of frigidity and ill-make: it is to be noticed, that the fir&s;t is thus defined, in the canon we have referred to: <HI>frigidus is cen&s;etur qui licit habeat membrum, habet tamen invtile ad copulam, quia inerigi|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le quod melius facto pote&s;t in&s;pici buam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erbis exprimi&punc;</HI> viz. They are to be accounted frigid, who have the vi|rile member perfect in form, but which is, notwith&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="139" REF="033585_0139_0FF790D560177058">
unu&s;eful for copulation, becau&s;e incapable of erec|tion; which is a circum&s;tance better under&s;tood by in|&s;pection than explained with words. Such a member, &s;aith the law, is good for nothing; becau&s;e <HI>olli durae quies nervos affereus urget &s;omnus.</HI> It is as it were dead, and &s;leeps a &s;leep of iron; that is, it wants that motive faculty which is the &s;ummit of its utility.&mdash;As vi&s;itations for the purpo&s;es of in&s;pecting virility, are not known in this country, we &s;hall be more particular in de&s;cribing them&mdash;"They manage the&s;e things better in France," for there, very little depends upon the oath of the accu|&s;ing party. The &s;eachers, as we have before ob&s;erved, are men, and generally tho&s;e &s;omewhat advanced in years; and in a bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature, they are in&s;tructed to lay a&s;ide the language of judges, and talk to the parties as cordial friends, officiou&s;ly tending them their advice; and more than this, like a favourable judge, who &s;ome|times puts words in the mouth of a culprit at the bar, they &s;ometimes point out methods and expedients to the impotent per&s;on, informing him how he may exhibit the token of virility in its be&s;t appearance. They addre&s;&s;ed the Marquis de Ge&s;vres in the following manner, when they paid him the vi&s;it of in&s;pection. "Sir, we readily allow that the ma&s;ter of a law-office and four &s;earchers, are by no means the mo&s;t inviting objects to put nature in a good humour; and therefore, that not being the ca&s;e at this pre&s;ent in&s;tant, &s;end for us any morning, and call us into your chamber in the happy minute, when, with|in the privacy of four curtains, if that moment has not arrived, you &s;hall wait for that favourable glance from nature's eye, which &s;he never refu&s;es long to per&s;ons of your age, who are not entirely under her di&s;plea&s;ure.&mdash; Then happy &s;hall we be to be witne&s;&s;es of the alteration &s;he &s;hall have wrought in you."</P>
<P>Thus indulgently they dealt with the Marquis, but, after all their efforts, they could by no means give in their ultimatum as favourable:&mdash;there is no doubt but they made u&s;e of every incentive, for the French lawyers inform us, that in many ca&s;es the &s;earchers did
<PB N="140" REF="033585_0140_0FF790D70115C560">
not merely tru&s;t to the formation of the virile member in a &s;tate of flacidity, but would often prick it, to di&s;cover whether it had feeling or not. The duty of &s;earchers is thus inculcated in one of the old law books: Debent in|&s;picere utrum homo moveatur ad libidinem; viz. they ought to &s;ee whether the man can be moved by lu&s;t.</P>
<P>Before we proceed any further, in order to enter into the &s;pirit of the pleaders on both &s;ides of this ca&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the &s;uperior accuracy and circum|&s;tantiailty of the French laws, by explaining &s;ome par|ticular terms, &s;uch as the Congre&s;s, the Vi&s;itation, &amp;c. the former of which is &s;imply nothing more than the act of copulation, in the pre&s;ence of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical judge appointed to &s;ee it done: this ceremony has been of late aboli&s;hed, becau&s;e, in one ca&s;e, it once led the judges into an error. And it has been &s;ince ob&s;erved, that one happy or unhappy quarter of an hour, was &s;ufficient to fix a man's fate in a trial of this kind for ever; as it was exceedingly difficult, if a per&s;on generally impotent, could not find him&s;elf capable once in the cour&s;e of a few months!&mdash;Vi&s;itation or in&s;pection has been the &s;ub&s;titute for the Congre&s;s, which being a real and local &s;tate, is ever the &s;ame, and &s;ubject to no vici&s;&s;itude. Again, the Congre&s;s depended upon the concurrence of two adver&s;e parties, one of whom, the wife, as the coun|&s;el ob&s;erved, might ea&s;ily &s;upplant the other, while the vi&s;itation requires no more of the wife than a little pa|tience, which &s;he will gladly lend as a ran&s;om for her mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Copulation is al&s;o defined to con&s;i&s;t of Motion, Pene|tration, and Expul&s;ion; and con&s;equently as the evi|dence of the latter could only be obtained by the wife's per&s;on, her evidence was always &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficient and therefore, as Madam de Ma&s;cranny was &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay to her hu&s;band, "The end of your marrying me was to make me pa&s;s from my-maiden condition to that of a wife; yet, after a long cohabitation, after many attempts and endea|vours, you have left me the &s;ame as you found me; you are therefore culpable and in&s;ufficient."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="033585_0141_0FF790DB24A0A5E0">Vi&s;itation, and the te&s;timony or oath of the wife, was further preferred, on account of the little dependance that could be made on the external appearance and con|formation of the virile member in a man; and the canon law even illu&s;trates the ca&s;e of a lifele&s;s member, in a &s;imile from &s;acred writ, viz. for as the body without the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o al&s;o, &amp;c. &amp;c. Still it is apparent, that the evidence of a wife is not always to be depended upon, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be actuated by malice, or regard|le&s;s of an oath&mdash;The following ca&s;e offers a &s;hrewd &s;u|&s;picion of an in&s;tance of this kind&mdash;"A hu&s;band becomes a father, lo&s;es a wife, and proceeds to a &s;econd marriage. After &s;everal months cohabitation with his &s;econd wife, he goes a voyage to &s;ea. During his ab&s;ence this &s;econd wife marries another man; and the fir&s;t hu&s;band, at his return home, is &s;aluted with an accu&s;ation of impotency, which he an&s;wers by &s;aying, I have had a child of my fir&s;t marriage; but the wife in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that the birth of that child was only owing to his wife's having to do with another man. Behold the &s;tate of this conte&s;t, in which it is vi&s;ible, that the &s;earchers could not rea&s;onably doubt of the faculties of one who had been a father!"</P>
<P>Still to proceed, there is a very great latitude in the notions, that the French lawyers, as well as the canon law, entertain of a temporary impotency in a man. Ma|dam Ma&s;cranny's advocate in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that the Mar|quis de Ge&s;vres was afflicted with a pal&s;y in the parts, and quotes Zachias, Tit. 9. Book ix. that author &s;ays he, tells us that a man's genitals &s;ometimes fall into a pal&s;y; that then there's an end of hope: all is lo&s;t! no re&s;ource left! And this not only when this evil &s;eizes people who are upon the decline in point of years, but likewi&s;e when it attacks young folks: then &s;ays Zachias, nature lo&s;es the habitude of conveying the &s;pirits towards the afflicted parts; and from thence it happens, that tho&s;e &s;pirits &s;o entirely quit their channel, that they never re&s;ume it again. And this is doubtle&s;s the rea&s;on why that grave author, the great Petrone, who has &s;poken &s;o ill of the Canoni&s;ts, puts the&s;e words into the mouth of a lady di&s;|&s;atisfied
<PB N="142" REF="033585_0142_0FF790DCB542B848">
with her favourite, <HI>parali&s;incave</HI>&mdash;Away, wretch! you are going into a pal&s;y.</P>
<P>How ju&s;tly, &s;ay the Canoni&s;ts, does all this apply to the text and rule of the apo&s;tle: <HI>Vir non habet pote&s;tatem &s;ui corporis &s;ed mulier</HI>&mdash;A man hath not power over his own body, but the woman.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding a &s;uperb and pompous appear|ance of ability, is often fallacious; yet &s;uch per&s;ons who can afford no &s;uch &s;hew, are ju&s;tly to be di&s;tru&s;ted; and as the French advocate goes &s;ome length upon apparent capability, when the thing by no means exi&s;t, we &s;hall therefore make u&s;e of that part of his plea verbatim: "It is undeniably true, and is confirmed by the experience of all mankind, that the difference between able women's men, and tho&s;e that are frigid, is this: In the former, the penis is contracted and &s;hrunk up, during the time that it does not actually &s;tand; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge of its length and thickne&s;s unle&s;s it is erect and &s;tiff. Whereas it is quite the contrary in tho&s;e that are frigid, as in the carca&s;e of a dead man. For &s;uch indeed have a penis, but it is never contracted or &s;hrunk up; it has a continual length and thickne&s;s, (as in other men when it &s;tands) but then it always hangs its head, and is incapable of a perfect and con&s;i&s;tent erection.&mdash;See Zachias upon this head in chapter concerning the tokens of virility and impotency.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, by all who have written concerning impotency, as well canoni&s;ts as phy|&s;icians, that there are many men who&s;e penis very readily ri&s;es, nay, lifts it&s;elf up in a mo&s;t proud and o&s;tentatious manner; but then it's fury is as &s;oon &s;pent; like a fire made of &s;traw, the moment it ap|proaches its mi&s;tre&s;s's door, it ba&s;ely falls down at the very thre&s;hold, and piteou&s;ly vomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s out its frothy &s;oul (alluding to that ver&s;e of Tibullus, Janua difficilis dominae te verberet imber.) The&s;e kinds of impotents are not rare nor unfrequent. Ho&s;tien&s;is queries, whether they are to be ranked among the frigid, &s;ince their vice proceeds not from
<PB N="143" REF="033585_0143_0FF790DE99323200">
the frigidity, but rather too much calidity of their blood. Of this &s;ort of infirmity we have a noted in&s;tance in the Baron du Pont, mentioned by Ar|gentraeus.</P>
<P>This Lord was &s;eparated from his wife, Catha|rine de Parthenay, heire&s;s of Soubi&s;e, for impo|tency, Argentraeus, in the article 429, of the cu&s;|tom of Bretagne, gives this de&s;cription of his im|potency: Quidam Juvenis valenti corpore uxorem inire non poterat, et&s;i ben&egrave; na&s;utus, &s;ed &s;imul ac ner|vum admoverat, &s;emen praecipitat&acirc; &s;e&s;tinatione ejiciebat, ita ut nihil intr&agrave; injiceret, nec intromittere po&s;&s;et genitale. He was a young man of a hale con|&s;tituon, but could not enter his wife's body, though rarely well hung; for &s;o &s;oon as he approached her with his penis, his &s;emen flew off with &s;uch preci|pitation, that &s;he was not at all the better for it, nor could his label of morality make its way into love's paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, our in&s;pectors warn us not to tru&s;t to the &s;tiffne&s;s of the virile organ; there being in many an erective force, but not effective, becau&s;e not &s;olid, &s;ober, and &s;trong enough to hold out to the end; and therefore we mu&s;t always con&s;ult the wife's per&s;on, if we would know what has been done by the man, whether at fir&s;t &s;ight he appears to be a man, or whether he does not. For though he appears to be a man, he is not pre&s;ently to be concluded &s;uch, becau&s;e there are &s;ome who&s;e en|&s;ign of manhood is a mere cheat, gives mighty hopes, but performs nothing. Again, though he does not appear a man, it does not follow, that he is not a man; becau&s;e the tokens of manhood do &s;ometimes lie hid, and &s;ometimes pop out. And therefore, by in&s;pecting the hu&s;band, no certain judgment can be made either for or again&s;t virility; but by in&s;pect|ing the wife, both doubts are removed. For if in the wife, the &s;eal of virginity appears to be broke, it is mo&s;t certain, both that the hu&s;band has vigour,
<PB N="144" REF="033585_0144_0FF790E3F96A3A18">
nay, and an efficacious vigour; but if the &s;eals re|main whole and unhurt, there is, &s;ay the canons, a certain and violent &s;u&s;picion, that the vigour of the man, if it did exert it&s;elf, was fallacious; and if it did not exert it&s;elf, then there was the &s;ame &s;u&s;|picion that nature had denied him it. And this &s;u&s;picion, though pre&s;umptive, has the force of all undoubted proof, &s;ince the canons rely thereon, as appears per chapter Propo&s;ui&s;ti, chapter Litterae, and by all the doctors, to a man."</P>
<P>Having now produced the &s;ub&s;tance of every argu|ment made u&s;e of upon this famous trial, on the part of the lady, we &s;hall draw to a conclu&s;ion, with|out dwelling upon the arguments in favour of the Marquis, becau&s;e they are merely de&s;ultory and &s;o|phi&s;tical; and as &s;uch they were treated; for, not|with&s;tanding all the influence of his family, and Madam Maintenon's interpo&s;ition with the King on his behalf, nothing better could be obtained than an order from his Maje&s;ty, that Madam de Ma&s;cranny &s;hould continue to cohabit with the Marquis, till he was 25 year's of age; as his father, the Duke, a&s;&s;ured the King, that he him&s;elf was impotent till that period.&mdash;The Duke's family were not the mo&s;t opulent in France, but the Lady had an e&s;tate of 4000l. per year, be&s;ides a great &s;um in ready ca&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;econd octavo volume of this trial, which like the pre&s;ent, is &s;welled up by a number of ca&s;es quite irrelative in any other eye than that of the law, contains examples of many artificial maiden-heads&mdash;de&s;criptions of &s;mall orifices&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ed marks of virginity, impotency, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>The Trial of Mrs. Fanny Wilmot, wife of John Wilmot, E&s;q. M. P. for Adul|tery with Edward Wa&s;hborn, a Foot|man. In 1790.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM Garthwaite &s;aid, that he went to live as butler, in the family of John Wilmot, E&s;q. at his hou&s;e in Bedford-Row, and continued to live in his &s;ervice un|til &s;ome time on or about the 25th day of April la&s;t: and that John Wilmot and his wife Fanny Wilmot lived and cohabited together as lawful hu&s;band and wife, and had &s;ix children, viz. one &s;on and five daughters, who are all now living, and the younge&s;t of them about the age of five years; and that on all occa&s;ions, as far as he knew, they owned and acknowledged them&s;elves to be lawful hu&s;band and wife, and for and as &s;uch they were and now are commonly accounted and taken to be; and that Mr. Wilmot, on all occa&s;ions, behaved to, and treated his wife with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, love and affection.</P>
<P>He further &s;aid, that when he went to live with Mr. Wilmot, he kept nine dome&s;tic &s;ervants, viz. a butler, a coachman, a footman, an under footman, a lady's maid or own woman, an hou&s;e-keeper, a nur&s;ery-maid, an hou&s;e-maid, and a kitchen-maid; and that Edward Wa&s;h|born lived there as footman, and continued there until February 1791. And this witne&s;s under&s;tood that Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn had lived in the family about &s;even years in all.</P>
<P>He further depo&s;ed, that unle&s;s his mi&s;tre&s;s Fanny Wilmot had female vi&s;itors, which was very &s;eldom the ca&s;e, &s;he u&s;ed every day to retire from table &s;oon after &s;he had dined, and go into the back drawing-room, where &s;he mo&s;tly &s;at, leaving her hu&s;band with his children, in the dining-parlour. That about a fortnight after this

witne&s;s went to live in the family, he began to remark, that Edward Wa&s;hborn u&s;ed to eat his dinner ha&s;tily, and go up &s;tairs to his mi&s;tre&s;s in the back drawing-room, un|der pretence to carry her dog victuals, and continued &s;uch practice until he left the family. Upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions he would &s;tay twenty, thirty, or forty minutes in the room with his mi&s;tre&s;s, until his ma&s;ter was about to leave the dining-parlour, which was known by his ringing the bell, for the butler to clear the tables; when he has fre|quently &s;een Edward Wa&s;hborn come down &s;tairs from his mi&s;tre&s;s, either with the coal-box in his hand, or the plate on which he had taken the dog's victuals. It was the cu&s;tom he &s;aid of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to breakfa&s;t in the dining-parlour; after breakfa&s;t, his ma&s;ter u&s;ed generally to go out and not return for &s;ome hours, while his mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed as con&s;tantly after breakfa&s;t to retire to the back drawing-room. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn, as footman, to clear away the breakfa&s;t things, which after he has done, he has been frequently &s;een by this witne&s;s going into the back drawing-room to his mi&s;tre&s;s, where he has &s;taid alone with her near twen|ty or thirty minutes; and this witne&s;s was the more par|ticular in watching him, as he had &s;ome &s;u&s;picions on his mind that there was too great a familiarity carrying on be|tween him and his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And even after he was di&s;charged from the hou&s;e and &s;ervice of Mr. Wilmot, he u&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding, fre|quently, during the months of February, March, and April, to come and dine and drink tea with the &s;ervants, as this deponent apprehends, chiefly by the invitation of Elizabeth Smith, the hou&s;ekeeper, by rea&s;on that &s;he would, upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, tell him &s;he had a&s;ked Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn to come and dine with them, &s;aying, it mu&s;t be very dull for him; but the latter remarked, it was generally in the ab&s;ence of Mr. Wilmot, or when he happened to dine abroad, that Wa&s;hborn came; and that at &s;uch times, Fanny Wilmot, &s;oon after &s;he retired from the dining-parlour, u&s;ed to ring her drawing-room bell, which was in general an&s;wered by the footman, who, af|ter
<PB N="147" REF="033585_0147_0FF790E9339D8BF8">
going to his mi&s;tre&s;s, would return and tell Elizabeth Smith her mi&s;tre&s;s wanted her, who would thereupon go to her, but &s;oon returning, he has ob&s;erved her to make private &s;ignals to Wa&s;hborn, &s;ometimes by holding up one of her fingers, &s;ometimes by pu&s;hing him with her elbow, and &s;ometimes by u&s;ing particular ge&s;tures, and on receiving &s;uch private intimations, he u&s;ed to leave the kitchen, or &s;ervants' hall, and go up &s;tairs into the back drawing-room, and remain there alone with Fanny Wilmot, from twenty to forty minutes&mdash;This witne&s;s &s;aid he could &s;peak the more po&s;itively to the foregoing circum&s;tances, on account of having &s;trong &s;u&s;picions that an improper intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her and Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn; he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s more particu|larly to have an eye upon their conduct.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he noticed, that one day la&s;t April, his mi&s;tre&s;s had been for &s;ome time looking from the front windows of the drawing-room into the &s;treet, and on a &s;udden ob&s;erved, that &s;he put on her hat and cloak, and went out into the &s;treet, pulling the door after her; when, &s;u&s;pecting the bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;oon afterwards went out into the &s;treet him&s;elf, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way he &s;aw Edward Wa&s;hborn, but that he might not &s;uppo&s;e this witne&s;s was upon the look-out, he a&s;ked him where Mr. Wilmot's &s;mith lived, and being informed, he immediately left him, pretending he was going to &s;uch &s;mith's, but &s;till for &s;ome little time kept his eye upon Wa&s;hborn, whom he ob&s;erved to follow Mrs. Wilmot, but did not watch them further, being apprehen&s;ive that they might ob&s;erve him &s;o doing.</P>
<P>On or about the 25th of March, he &s;aid, that Elizabeth Barnes, Fanny Wilmot's own woman, having gone out, returned about eight o'clock in the evening, and &s;oon af|terwards came into the kitchen, and a&s;ked him if her mi&s;tre&s;s was from home, and upon his &s;aying No, &s;he &s;aid, It was very odd, &s;he had been trying to open the back drawing-room door, and found it fa&s;tened; he then took no notice to Elizabeth Barnes, but &s;u&s;pecting that Edward Wa&s;hborn might be locked up there with his
<PB N="148" REF="033585_0148_0FF790EC13F55448">

But while he remained on the li&s;ten on the kitchen &s;tair-ca&s;e, and almo&s;t immediately afterwards, he heard his mi&s;tre&s;s return up &s;tairs, and pre|&s;ently come down again very &s;oftly, with another foot coming down &s;tairs at the &s;ame time with her; both went along the pa&s;&s;age, and he then heard the &s;treet door open very gently, upon which he crept up three or four &s;tairs, and &s;aw his mi&s;tre&s;s with the door in her hand about a quarter open, and gently &s;hutting the &s;ame to, and &s;he then returned, and having opened the back-door to let the dog in, went up &s;tairs&mdash;He then went down &s;tairs into the kitchen, and having joined Clough, he a&s;ked him whom he had &s;een go out at the &s;treet-door, who an&s;wer|ed, Edward Wa&s;hborn. From the foregoing circum|&s;tances he is firmly per&s;uaded that Wa&s;hborn had been locked up &s;ome time with his mi&s;tre&s;s, in the back draw|ing-room, that it was not known to any of the &s;ervants in the family, that Wa&s;hborn was in the hou&s;e, previous to Elizabeth Barnes returning home that evening as before-mentioned; &s;o that he did verily believe, that he was let into the hou&s;e on that occa&s;ion, privately, by Mrs. Wilmot, in the &s;ame manner as he was let out. This witne&s;s well remembered that his ma&s;ter was from home at the time, having an engagement to dine abroad on that day.</P>
<P>He further &s;aid, that on Sunday the tenth of April la&s;t, Mr. Wilmot dined abroad, and Mrs. Fanny Wilmot at home with Mrs. Pa&s;call, a lady of her acquaintance;

that ju&s;t as the &s;ervants had fini&s;hed their dinner, the drawing-room bell rung, which was an&s;wered by Samuel Clough, who, as he was going into the room, he &s;aw Mrs. Pa&s;call going out of doors with one of Mr. Wilmot's children, to take a walk; that Clough &s;oon returned from the drawing-room, and on being a&s;ked what the bell rung for, he &s;aid, it was for Wa&s;hborn (who had on that day dined with them in the kitchen) to go up to his mi&s;tre&s;s; and pre&s;ently afterwards this witne&s;s &s;aw Edward Wa&s;h|born go up &s;tairs, and heard his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;peaking to him in the drawing-room, the door being open; in about five minutes afterwards, going up again &s;oftly, and ob&s;erving the drawing-room door was &s;hut, he then returned into the dining-parlour, determining to watch Wa&s;hborn's coming down, and &s;oon afterwards heard a creaking noi&s;e in the drawing-room, which he verily believes proceeded from his mi&s;tre&s;s and Edward Wa&s;hborn's being upon the large &s;opha, which always &s;tood in &s;uch room; and from &s;uch noi&s;e, which continued &s;ome minutes, he was induced to believe, that Fanny Wilmot and him were then and there committing adultery together; but after they had remained &s;hut up in the drawing-room near thirty minutes, Wa&s;hborn came down &s;tairs and went in|to the kitchen; while, as he went up on a pretence to go into the back drawing-room, he met his mi&s;tre&s;s on the landing-place, and ob&s;erved &s;he was without her hat, and that her hair appeared very much di&s;ordered, although at the time of dinner and afterwards, &s;he wore a hat, and her hair appeared to be well dre&s;&s;ed and powdered.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of watching to di&s;cover what this witne&s;s pretended to know beforehand, mu&s;t have been very great; as having leave to go to the play one evening with &s;ome of the maid &s;ervants, he could not &s;tay with them, but came home and got into the &s;table, where he &s;ent for Samuel Clough, and de&s;ired him al&s;o to watch his mi&s;|tre&s;s's motions!</P>
<P>William Tap&s;cott, coachman to Mr. Wilmot, &s;aid, that living in the family ever &s;ince 1788, it appeared to him that his mi&s;tre&s;s frequently fought opportunities of

being alone with her footman, Edward Wa&s;hborn; and he was the more induced to notice her conduct by rea|&s;on that, about a twelvemonth before that time, whil&s;t the family were at the country-hou&s;e at Wand&s;worth in Sur|ry, he was pa&s;&s;ing by the breakfa&s;t-parlour window, and then ob&s;erved that his mi&s;tre&s;s and Wa&s;hborn were in the parlour, and that his arms was round his mi&s;tre&s;s's wai&s;t, which he immediately dropt on his pa&s;&s;ing by. And further, his mi&s;tre&s;s u&s;ed in town, he &s;aid, (unle&s;s &s;he had ladies to vi&s;it her, which was not often the ca&s;e) to re|tire from table &s;oon after &s;he had dined, and go into her drawing-room, when Edward Wa&s;hborn u&s;ed to go as &s;oon as he had dined, and carry her dog victuals in a plate and upon the&s;e occa&s;ions remain with her ten minutes, and &s;ometimes a quarter of an hour together. He had &s;everal times noticed, as &s;oon as his ma&s;ter's bell has rung for the butler to clear the dining-table, that Wa&s;h|born has come running down &s;tairs from his mi&s;tre&s;s, in order, as he apprehended, to avoid being &s;een with her by his ma&s;ter. And that after breakfa&s;t, as &s;oon as his ma&s;ter was gone out, he u&s;ed to go into the room to his mi&s;tre&s;s when &s;he has been alone, where they have re|mained alone together for a quarter of an hour at a time.</P>
<P>Previous to the di&s;charge of Wa&s;hborn from the &s;er|vice of Mr. Wilmot, which took place in February la&s;t, he &s;aid he never knew his mi&s;tre&s;s to walk out unatten|ded by &s;ome or one of the men-&s;ervants, but after that event he has ob&s;erved her &s;everal times to walk out alone without any &s;ervant; and on the twentieth of April la&s;t, having heard from one of his fellow-&s;ervants that &s;he was going to walk out, and &s;u&s;pecting &s;he was going to Wa&s;h|born's lodging, No. 12, in Kings-&s;treet, Holborn, he was determined to watch her, and for that purpo&s;e went to a public hou&s;e fronting the &s;treet where, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, he &s;aw her go into the hou&s;e where Wa&s;hborn then lodged; and in about three quar|ters of an hour afterwards he &s;aw her come out, and Wa&s;hborn following her to the door, and &s;eeming as if he was &s;peaking to her, and then bowing to her as &s;he left

From that time &s;he &s;aid &s;he was cautious how &s;he put her&s;elf in the way of break|ing in upon them when &s;he has known them to be alone in a room together, as her mi&s;tre&s;s on the beforemention|ed

This letter was written by Mr. Wilmot, informing her of his having di&s;|covered her infidelity, and in&s;i&s;ting that &s;he &s;hould not return to his hou&s;e, recommending it to her to advi&s;e with her friends, promi&s;ing to &s;end her linen, and wear|ing apparel, and to furni&s;h her with money occa&s;ionally. When this letter was delivered, Mr. Wilmot went up &s;tairs to the dining-room, and tenderly expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ion for the per&s;onal &s;afety of Mrs. Wilmot; left the &s;hame of the di&s;covery &s;hould be too much for her&mdash;But &s;oon afterwards Mrs. Wilmot came out of the chamber, and was acco&s;ted by her hu&s;band, who led her into the oppo&s;ite dining-room, where &s;uch a &s;cene en|&s;ued between them as made this witne&s;s very apprehen|&s;ive that Mr. Wilmot would be overpowered by the poignancy of his feelings, e&s;pecially as he knew he was not in a good &s;tate of health&mdash;While Mr. Wilmot and Fanny Wilmot were conver&s;ing together, this deponent and his fellow witne&s;s, went into the chamber, and ob|&s;erved that the bed was greatly tumbled&mdash;At length Mr. Wilmot and this witne&s;s withdrew from the hou&s;e, but Mrs. Wilmot &s;taid there; in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, this deponent again &s;aw and conver&s;ed with her, and about nine o'clock in the evening of the &s;ame day he again &s;aw and talked with her, in Wa&s;hborn's chamber, Wa&s;hborn being pre&s;ent: and Fanny Wilmot then in|formed the witne&s;s that &s;he intended to &s;leep that night in the hou&s;e, and he was afterwards informed, and believes, &s;he did remain at the hou&s;e until the next morning. He further &s;aid, he was well a&s;&s;ured that Mr. John Wilmot is a Member of Parliament, a Ma&s;ter in Chancery, and a Commi&s;&s;ioner of American Claims; and that his vari|ous

avocations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have occa&s;ioned him to be ab&s;ent a great deal from his hou&s;e in Bedford-row.</P>
<P>It further appeared, that about noon on the afore&s;aid Monday, Mr. John Wilmot cau&s;ed the trunks and boxes in Wa&s;hborn's apartments in King-&s;treet to be &s;earched by a peace-officer, in the pre&s;ence of him John Wilmot, Fanny Wilmot his wife, Edward Wa&s;hborn, this depo|nent, and his fellow-witne&s;s, Thomas Scatchard; and that in the trunks, or boxes, there were found a parcel of guineas wrapped up in paper, and a large a&s;&s;ortment of fa&s;hionable and new cloaths, but no letters; and on being que&s;tioned by this witne&s;s, Wa&s;hborn in the pre|&s;ence and hearing of his mi&s;tre&s;s, acknowledged that he had received many letters from her, and that he had burnt them on the preceding day; which Mrs. Fanny Wilmot, on being que&s;tioned by her hu&s;band, acknow|ledged &s;he had written and &s;ent letters to Edward Wa&s;h|born&mdash;There were al&s;o divers prints and drawings which Mrs. Wilmot and Edward Wa&s;hborn then acknowledged had belonged to her, and that &s;he had given the &s;ame to him, and al&s;o a &s;hirt-pin, &s;et with hair, wrapped in &s;il|ver paper, and appeared to be quite new; an elegant fan|cy gold ring, &s;et with hair, a box with curious &s;hells, a nutmeg grater in the &s;hape of a heart, a pocket-book, an ink-&s;tand, two riding-whips, a &s;traw-box, and a bot|tle of &s;weet water with a label bearing the in&s;cription of "Eau de Cologne," and various other articles. And as for the hair in the head of the &s;hirt-pin, Mrs. Wilmot acknowledged it was her own.</P>
<P>It further appeared, that while Mr. Wilmot was in great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, on account of his wife's infidelity, and the nece&s;&s;ity there was for pre&s;erving appearances, till he could obtain &s;ufficient evidence of her guilt, he in|formed the re&s;pondent of his having been applied to give a character of Wa&s;hborn to Colonel Popham, and &s;eve|ral times expre&s;&s;ed the embarra&s;&s;ment he laboured under on that account; but this witne&s;s advi&s;ed him to give &s;uch a character; he did &s;o, and it was &s;ince believed that Wa&s;hborn was, by appointment, to go, and did go, to his
<PB N="160" REF="033585_0160_0FF7910A8CC8C038">
place at the &s;aid Colonel Popham's, late in the evening of the twenty-fifth of April la&s;t.</P>
<P>This witne&s;s, in re&s;pect to what he &s;aw in Wa&s;hborn's room, &s;aid, that on Saturday the twenty-third day of A|pril, he ob&s;erved the reflection of the heads of Fanny Wilmot and Edward Wa&s;hborn, face to face, and after|wards &s;aw the reflection of her head in motion, and al&s;o a tremulous motion in the te&s;ter and curtains of the bed, and after that Fanny Wilmot and Edward Wa&s;hborn &s;tanding hand in hand together, and conver&s;ing together in an earne&s;t and agitated manner.</P>
<P>He further &s;aid, that he furni&s;hed his fellow-witne&s;s, Thomas Scatchard, with gimblets of all the &s;izes he could meet with in an ironmonger's, with &s;ome or one of which he made three or four holes in different parts of the wain|&s;cot of the room, by means of which they found the whole of the nook or corner to which the parties u&s;ed to retire, might be fully viewed; but, from an apprehen&s;ion of being called on as a witne&s;s, and believing Thomas Scatchard would be fully competent to the proving the adultery between the parties, he mode&s;tly felt him&s;elf a|ver&s;e to looking through the hole, while he &s;uppo&s;ed the parties were committing adultery together; but, at length, on being &s;trongly urged by his fellow-witne&s;s, he did for a moment look through one of the holes, ju&s;t before Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn opened the door, but Fanny Wilmot was then &s;tanding &s;o clo&s;e to the wain&s;cot, that he could not &s;ee any thing but her gown; by that means he e&s;ca|ped being put to the blu&s;h!</P>
<P>Neither could he &s;ay he ever &s;aw the mini&s;trant and Wa&s;hborn lying down together on the bed in the room; nor take upon him&s;elf to depo&s;e po&s;itively to an act of adultery between them; but he was witne&s;s to &s;o many ap|proximate acts, that he has not any doubts in his mind, but that they did frequently commit adultery together.</P>
<P>It is now worth while to ob&s;erve Mrs. Wilmot's con|fidence in denying the charge of adultery; as the time when &s;he was leaving Wa&s;hborn's chamber, in order to return home, this witne&s;s &s;topped up to her and introduced
<PB N="161" REF="033585_0161_0FF7910EE6F655B0">
her to her hu&s;band, who was at his elbow; at which Mrs. Wilmot appeared as though &s;he affected to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the producent's charging her with adultery, and repeatedly a&s;&s;ured him he was mi&s;taken, and even &s;olemn|ly declared &s;he was entirely innocent of that crime, ear|ne&s;tly &s;oliciting that her oath might be taken, as to her being innocent of the &s;ame. Wa&s;hborn al&s;o forced him|&s;elf into the company, and made the like declarations, and offered to take his oath to the &s;ame purport; and they both contended that the producent ought to be &s;atis|fied with &s;uch their oaths, and this witne&s;s had no doubt but that they would have taken their oaths accordingly; but he con&s;idered this part of their conduct to be part of a plan concerted between them, and further con&s;idered Wa&s;hborn's intru&s;ion &s;o improper, that he repeatedly drove him from the pre&s;ence of the producent. Mrs. Wilmot at fir&s;t, he &s;aid, urged there was nothing impro|per in her conduct; and even after the circum&s;tances which could be adduced in evidence again&s;t her, were &s;tated, &s;he de&s;ired &s;he might be allowed to clear her&s;elf on oath, and then that her little indi&s;cretions might be forgiven! and &s;he particularly de&s;ired Mr. Wilmot would not mention the matter to his father and family. And, lawyer-like, after obtaining an account of the &s;eve|ral charges which were to be made again&s;t her, &s;he a&s;ked whether the re&s;pondent and his fellow-witne&s;s, Thomas Scatchard, would take upon them&s;elves to &s;wear, that they had &s;een <HI>an ab&s;olute act</HI> of adultery, and on being an&s;wer|ed in the negative, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the re&s;pond|ent, and &s;aid, as &s;he obe&s;erved that the producent acted under his opinion, &s;he de&s;ired to argue the ca&s;e with him and then contended, as the producent could not prove a po&s;itive act of adultery, he could not avail him&s;elf of the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, &s;o as to obtain a divorce!!!</P>
<P>A Deputy's lady in the city hearing this part of the trial, exclaimed, to <HI>large&s;t half,</HI> "Dear, dear, Mr. Dum|pling, did you ever hear &s;o much <HI>imperence</HI> in all your born-days!"</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="033585_0162_0FF791109DB49570">All the witne&s;&s;es proved that the hou&s;e of Mrs. Page, where Wa&s;hborn lodged, was a decent hou&s;e, as well as that Mrs. Page was a very di&s;creet woman!</P>
<P>Thomas Scatchard, of Wardrobe Place, Doctor's Commons, London, went exactly over the &s;ame ground as the la&s;t witne&s;s, but was very particular in a&s;&s;erting that he plainly &s;aw the curtain &s;hake; that having looked for &s;ome time, he gave place to his fellow-witne&s;s, Perrot Fenton, who al&s;o looked for &s;ome time, and then gave place to him again, who, on looking again, by the help of the looking-gla&s;s which hung again&s;t the pier between the &s;econd and third windows, ob&s;erved, that Wa&s;hborn, and Mrs. Wilmot had come more forward into the room and &s;aw them embrace and ki&s;s each other &s;everal times, till Wa&s;hborn &s;unk down before &s;uch lady, out of his &s;ight.&mdash;But, previous to this, by opening the holes in the wain&s;cot; he very plainly &s;aw Wa&s;hborn and Mrs. Wil|mot &s;tanding together between the bed and fire-place, and apparently in conver&s;ation; that pre&s;ently afterwards they &s;at down on the bed-&s;ide clo&s;e to each other, when Edward Wa&s;hborn took the lady by the left hand and ki&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, and when he had &s;o done, he &s;tooped a little, and with his right hand pulled up her petticoats a|above her knees, &s;o that this witne&s;s could plainly &s;ee her naked thighs; that he then &s;tooped and ki&s;&s;ed her naked thigh once or twice, and having &s;o done, this witne&s;s &s;aw him put his right-hand up her petticoats, which &s;he &s;eem|ed rather to re&s;i&s;t; but they &s;oon got up, and &s;tood face to face, when he ob&s;erved that the flap of Wa&s;hborn's breeches was unbuttoned; that Edward Wa&s;hborn again put one of his hands up the petticoats of &s;uch lady, and his other hand round her wai&s;t; &s;he making &s;ome little re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;tanding cro&s;s-legged; and that having &s;tood for &s;ome time in this &s;ituation, the lady appeared to be moving as if &s;he were about to go away.</P>
<P>Mary Page, of King-&s;treet, Bloom&s;bury, widow, &s;aid, that &s;ome time in the beginning of Febuary 1791, Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn applied to her to take an apartment or lodging in her hou&s;e; and conceiving him to be a gentle|man,
<PB N="163" REF="033585_0163_0FF791125580E9D0">
and having received a character of him as &s;uch, &s;he immediately agreed to let him have the u&s;e of a bed|room in her hou&s;e; where he lived for eleven weeks, dur|ing which, he was &s;everal times vi&s;ited there by Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, Mr. Wilmot's hou&s;e-keeper, whom this witne&s;s and her &s;ervant then under&s;tood, and believed to be, his aunt.</P>
<P>She added, that in about a fortnight after, he began to be vi&s;ited by a female per&s;on, about twice in the cour&s;e of every week, during the time he re&s;ided there. This female was always let into and out of the hou&s;e by Ed|ward Wa&s;hborn, and they were always together in his bed-room, and alone, but &s;he did not think they ever re|mained together at &s;uch vi&s;its for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Richard Town&s;end, and John Serjeant, of Doctor's Commons, London, Gentlemen, proved the marriage of the parties.</P>
<P>This very &s;ingular cau&s;e was fir&s;t brought into the Con|&s;i&s;tory Court of London&mdash;and from thence an Apeal was made to the Arches Court of Canterbury; where a Sentence of Divorce was obtained.</P>
<P>This trial, it &s;hould be remarked, is de&s;titute of a cir|cum&s;tance which has certainly di&s;tingui&s;hed a great num|ber of the kind&mdash;which is, that the lady's confidante has not become the principal witne&s;s again&s;t her!</P>

<HEAD>The Trial of George David&s;on, at New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne, in Augu&s;t, 1774; for a Rape upon I&s;abella Blair.</HEAD>
<P>THE following trial, as well as &s;ome others which appears in the cour&s;e of this Work, oc|curring at an a&s;&s;ize in the country, never appeared before in any collection whatever, and but for the a&s;&s;iduity of the Editors might have entirely e&s;ca|ped the cognizance of our readers.</P>
<P>Doctor Scott &s;aid, that about the 21&s;t of January la&s;t, I&s;abella Blair applied to him at Stannerton, where he practi&s;es phy&s;ic; that &s;he told him how &s;he had been u&s;ed by the pri&s;oner, and was advi&s;ed to come to him for his advice. The doctor &s;aid that he did not examine her clo&s;ely; &s;he complained of a pain and weakne&s;s in her back, and a pain in one of her legs and knee, which he found were inflamed and &s;welled. She told him that &s;he had been four days in coming from the place where &s;he lived to him; which is about ten miles&mdash;he gave her &s;ome medicines, and called afterwards to &s;ee her, and told her that the di&s;tance was too far for him to attend her properly, and to admini&s;ter the quantity of medicines her di&s;order required; and, likewi&s;e, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for her to apply to the Infirmary at Newca&s;tle, where &s;he would have the care taken of her that the di&s;temper required, and get the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the faculty of that hou&s;e. He was then a&s;ked by the court, if he thought the u&s;age &s;he met with from the pri&s;oner was the occa|&s;ion of that di&s;order &s;he complained of? he &s;aid, that in the manner &s;he told him the circum&s;tances, he made not the lea&s;t doubt but it was. That, as
<PB N="165" REF="033585_0165_0FF7911958E058E0">
far as he had examined, complaints of that nature might come by cold.</P>
<P>Doctor Rotheram &s;aid, that I&s;abella Blair came as a patient to the infirmary about the middle of February la&s;t; he being attending phy&s;ician that week, &s;he was under his care. That &s;he told him the circum&s;tances in the &s;ame manner as &s;he had &s;poken in court. He then examined her very mi|nutely, and found the vagina very much depre&s;&s;ed and inflamed. That the circum&s;tances appeared to him as if &s;he had been lain with by a man. On the doctor being a&s;ked with regard to her knee and leg he agreed with what Mr. Scott had &s;aid. He &s;aid he would not have the jury under&s;tand him that the inflammation and &s;welling might not be occa|&s;ioned by cold, as it was a rheumatic complaint&mdash; On his being a&s;ked if the pro&s;ecutrix's recovery was any ways doubtful? he &s;aid he looked upon her to be in a very dangerous way, as the di&s;order had fallen on her lungs.&mdash;He was further a&s;ked, if a wo|man who had never known man, might not appear, on examination, as if &s;he had. He &s;aid it was very obvious that a woman might be deflowered by a fall, &amp;c. though &s;he had never known man.</P>
<P>I&s;abella Blair &s;aid, that &s;he lived with Mr. Potts, at Ma&s;on Dinnington Hill-head, on the 12th of No|vember, 1773, on which day &s;he had leave to go to Stannerton to &s;ee her mi&s;tre&s;s's grand-children dance, who re&s;ided there; that on her return home &s;he called in at a public-hou&s;e at Ma&s;on Dinnington, with de&s;ire to go to &s;ee the dancers, as there was a dancing-&s;chool in that town, where &s;he met with the pri&s;oner at the bar, George David&s;on, drinking, who as hired to her mi&s;tre&s;s; he de&s;ired her to &s;it down, on which &s;he told him he had more need to go home to his wife than to be &s;itting there &s;pen|ding his money. The pri&s;oner then told her that his wife had taken the child that day along with her to go and &s;ee her (the pri&s;oner's wife's) mother.
<PB N="166" REF="033585_0166_0FF7911AF36A9900">
She then replied, he ought to be the more careful during her ab&s;ence, and de&s;ired of him, as it was late, to &s;ee her home. The pri&s;oner then told her, if &s;he would &s;top a little he would go with her. He then called for &s;ome more liquor, and &s;he went to &s;ee the dancers, and on her return &s;he found the pri&s;oner &s;till drinking; &s;he again &s;olicited him to go home with her, he then told her he would have a|nother pot, and then he would go with her. On this &s;he became very unea&s;y, and told him &s;he mu&s;t be going; he then &s;aid, as &s;oon as the liquor was out he would go with her, and at the &s;ame time added, he would lye with her in the way home. She then replied, "No, George, I hope not&mdash;I dare tru&s;t my&s;elf with you, as I think you are a better man than to do any thing to harm me." Upon this they came away together, and he was very peaceable till they were better than half way (this di&s;tance was better than a quarter of a mile) and then he took hold of her and threw her down on the ground &mdash;She, amazed at this treatment, a&s;ked him what he meant to do; he an&s;wered, he would lye with her; &s;he &s;aid, For God's &s;ake, George, rather take my life, for the one will be as agreeable as the other: he was then preparing to lye with her.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> What do you mean by preparing to lye with you?&mdash;He was letting down his breeches.</P>
<P>She then turned her&s;elf on her face; the pri&s;on|er then pulled up her cloaths behind; &s;he then &s;trug|gled with him and got upon her feet; upon this, he caught hold of her by the ancle, and &s;he fell upon her knees: he now took hold of her by the left arm, and twined her over on her back; &s;he &s;hout|ing with all her might, he put his hand upon her mouth; whil&s;t &s;he &s;truggled as much as &s;he was a|ble, till, quite &s;pent, &s;he could make no more re&s;i&s;t|ance. He then took hold of her by the legs and dragged her over five or &s;ix ridges of the field.</P>
<P>At this part of her examination the pro&s;ecrutrix
<PB N="167" REF="033585_0167_0FF7911C9A0358F8">
fainted, and coming to her&s;elf again, was informed by the court not to think any &s;hame, as there was a nece&s;&s;ity of her explaining every circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner then laid him&s;elf upon her, and had carnal knowledge of her body.</P>
<P>Here &s;he fainted a &s;econd time&mdash;On her recov|ery&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Did the pri&s;oner enter your body?&mdash;Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Did you feel any thing come from him?&mdash; Yes.</P>
<P>She fainted a third time.</P>
<P>On being a&s;ked if the pri&s;oner left her after this u&s;age, and if &s;he went home immediately, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had not power to move from the ground; that he &s;at upon the dike oppo&s;ite to her for about a minute, and then he came and u&s;ed her in the &s;ame manner as he had done before. He then rai&s;ed her from the ground, and bid her go home; &s;he not be|ing able to &s;tand, &s;unk down on her knees. The pri&s;oner then d&mdash;d her for a b&mdash;h, and a&s;ked her if &s;he had got drunk. That &s;he then de&s;ired the pri&s;oner to go and get &s;omebody to take her home; that the pri&s;oner then left her for &s;ome time, and returned again, &s;aying he had been to get her brother, but that he could get none of the fa|mily to hear, for they were all in bed. He then u&s;ed her in the &s;ame manner as before, &s;he not be|ing able to make any more re&s;i&s;tance. And after that he thru&s;t &s;omething hard up her body, which to her &s;eemed as if he was tearing out her bowels; that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t have been his hand; and he likewi&s;e put an old tobacco-chew there, which &s;he took out of that place her&s;elf; that from the an|gui&s;h and pain, &s;he was in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and could remember no more.</P>
<P>William Blair &s;aid, that the night on which it happened, which was on the 12th day of Novem|ber la&s;t, I&s;abella Blair, his &s;i&s;ter, went to Stannerton hopping. That about half pa&s;t ten o'clock that

night, as he was &s;tanding in the hou&s;e where he lived, he heard &s;omething like a rap at the door, when, on his opening it, his &s;i&s;ter fell into his arms. That as &s;oon as he brought her in and &s;aw her in the light, her cap was off, as was likewi&s;e her hand|kerchief: her brea&s;t was bare, and her cloaths torn and dirty. He a&s;ked her what was the matter. She told him &s;he had been very badly u&s;ed in &s;uch a field, and that &s;he had in &s;truggling lo&s;t her bun|dle, and upon her de&s;cribing the place, he immedi|ately took a lanthorn and candle, and went to the place in the field where it had happened; when he came there he found the gra&s;s laid down for about five ridges, as if &s;omebody had been lying and tum|bling there: that he found his &s;i&s;ter's cap, handker|chief, &amp;c. &s;ilver button; the cap and handkerchief were torn, (they were produced in court) that he then brought them home, where he found his &s;i&s;ter in a very weak condition, &s;itting in an arm-chair: on his being a&s;ked if he was then in|formed of her &s;ituation, and the per&s;on who had u&s;ed her &s;o, &s;he &s;aid, George David&s;on.</P>
<P>Roger Ma&s;on, &s;aid, that the night on which this affair happened he was at work in the byar; that his work being done, he came into the room where I&s;abella Blair was; he found her &s;itting in an arm-chair by the fire&mdash;her brother was &s;tanding with his back towards her&mdash;that &s;he &s;eemed to this de|ponent to be very ill&mdash;that her brea&s;t and head were bare, and her hair hanging about her &s;houlders &mdash;her brother got a lanthorn and candle and de&s;ired him to go along with him in &s;earch of her cloaths &mdash;that he went with him to the field, where they found the gra&s;s, &s;ome trodden down, and her cloaths were found in that place&mdash;On his being a&s;ked if he &s;aw the pri&s;oner that night, he &s;aid he did not &s;ee him till the next day, when he (the pri&s;oner) a&s;ked after Bella; this deponent then told him he had behaved to her in a very ba&s;e manner, and which
<PB N="169" REF="033585_0169_0FF791232DE4B3F8">

<HEAD>The Trial of Mrs. Timmings for Adul|tery, in the Con&s;i&s;tory Court of Lon|don; March 20, 1791.</HEAD>
<P>THE marriage being proved, Thomas Gillet, nephew and apprentice to Mr. John Timmings, in Steward-&s;treet, near Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, &s;aid, that after he became jour|neyman and foreman to Mr. Timmings, he very well knew Mr. J. Smith of Aldgate; and that Mr. and Mrs. Timmings always lived together as man and wife, till the month of January or February la&s;t, when Mrs. Tim|mings's unlawful connection with Mr. Smith and others, was fir&s;t di&s;covered. Mr. Smith, he &s;aid, he knew par|ticularly, by his bringing &s;hoes to the hou&s;e, and com|ing backwards and forwards as an acquaintance of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s. On the 12th of February, he &s;aid, that on Mr. Timmings's going out, he told him, the wit|ne&s;s, that he was going to Greenwich; and that between eight and nine o'clock on the &s;ame evening, Mr. Smith came to the hou&s;e; and he &s;oon afterwards &s;aw him in
<PB N="172" REF="033585_0172_0FF79129A5D689E8">
the kitchen, in company with Mrs. Timmings and Mary Gibbs, a maid-&s;ervant. From communications made to the witne&s;s by this maid &s;ervant, with re&s;pect to the con|duct of Mr. Smith and his mi&s;tre&s;s, prior to this period, he &s;aid, he &s;u&s;pected a criminal connection; and had, therefore, made a cavity through the wain&s;cot of the kitchen, on purpo&s;e to make u&s;e of the fir&s;t opportunity to ob&s;erve their behaviour. As this kitchen was on the ground-floor, he found the &s;tair-ca&s;e a very convenient place; and accordingly, &s;oon after Mr. Smith came in, having placed him&s;elf there, he kept his &s;ituation near two hours, during which time he &s;aw the maid dre&s;s a &s;owl, upon which her&s;elf, Mr. Smith, and her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;upped. Soon after this, Mary Gibbs put on her hat and cloak and went out, and left them together; this was near eleven at night: but as the witne&s;s &s;till kept his po&s;ition, he &s;oon ob&s;erved Mr. Smith draw his chair towards Mrs. Timmings, and put his left hand round her neck, while &s;he laid her head on his &s;houlder. He then ki&s;&s;ed her, and put his right-hand up her petticoats towards her pri|vate parts; in which &s;ituation, after they had remained &s;ome time, the witne&s;s ob&s;erved her petticoats drawn up, though he did not exactly &s;ee by what means; however, he was certain that Mr. Smith was then upon her, be|tween her legs, though he could not &s;ee whether his breeches were down or not; however, he plainly ob&s;er|ved his body in motion, while laying upon his mi&s;tre&s;s, in a chair; from all which circum&s;tances, he had no manner of doubt but they were then in the act of copu|lation, and had the carnal u&s;e and knowledge of each other's bodies. But while they were in this &s;ituation, he ob&s;erved Mr. Timmings ru&s;h into the kitchen, from a door leading to the yard, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr. Smith, &s;aid, "You ra&s;cal, how dare you come to my hou&s;e and u&s;e my wife in this manner!" on which the deponent left his &s;ituation and went into the yard, and from thence into the &s;treet, when he heard Timmings &s;ay, "Out, out, out, with you," and heard the &s;treet-door &s;hut, and Mrs. Timmings &s;ay, "Forgive me, for|give

me, I'll do &s;o no more!" he left his afore&s;aid &s;itua|tion at the time by him predepo&s;ed to; he did not &s;ee whether the &s;aid James Smith's breeches were down or not as articulate. He added, that he did not of his own knowledge know, that Mr. Timmings was apprized of the &s;ituation of the &s;aid per&s;ons, and did not &s;ee him from the time of his leaving his hou&s;e to go to Greenwich, un|til he &s;aw him ru&s;h into the kitchen. That, &s;oon after Mr. Timmings came into the &s;treet, where he and the de|ponent met, he appeared very much agitated, in&s;omuch that he begged the deponent to &s;upport him, and they went to the hou&s;e of Grace Timmings, his mother, in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, where he &s;taid about a quarter of an hour, and then with his aunt, Amey Barker, returned to his hou&s;e; he went there the next day, and &s;aw Mrs. Timmings go from thence, &s;ince which he never &s;aw her there, but had con&s;tantly &s;een her hu&s;band re&s;iding there.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grace Timmings, widow, of Bi&s;hop&s;gate &s;treet, &s;aid, that Mr. Chamberlain, of White Lion-&s;treet, Cha|pel Yard, being indirectly charged by her &s;on with be|ing connected with his wife, he agreed to come and &s;et|tle the matter with the latter at his hou&s;e in Union-&s;treet &mdash;he came accordingly, and Mr. Timmings, Mr. Cham|berlain, Mrs. Timmings, and her&s;elf, all went together into the fore parlour; Mrs. Timmings's father, Mr. Pe|ter Huet, of Hackney, was al&s;o pre&s;ent&mdash;Mr. Timmings then a&s;ked her, in the pre&s;ence of them all, whether &s;he did not go with Mr. Chamberlain to an hou&s;e of ill-fame in Winche&s;ter-&s;treet, on the preceeding Thur&s;day? to which &s;he an&s;wered, Yes&mdash;He then a&s;ked her what pa&s;|&s;ed there? to which &s;he an&s;wered, that Mr. Chamberlain took her up into a back room, and committed adultery with her&mdash;Mr. Timmings then a&s;ked her whether &s;he had ever been with him any where el&s;e? to which &s;he an&s;wered, Yes; and added, that &s;he went with Mr. Chamberlain to his warehou&s;e in White Lion-&s;treet on the Saturday following, where he again committed adul|tery with her, or words to that effect.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="033585_0174_0FF7912F052CDC10">The &s;ame witne&s;s, examined on interrogatories, &s;aid, that &s;he did neither know or believe that Mr. Timmings committed adultery with any loo&s;e woman, and there|by contract the veneral di&s;ea&s;e; but, on the contrary, had heard him declare that he had it of his wife, Mrs. Ann Timmings.</P>
<P>Thomas Mountfort, of Moon Yard, Shoreditch, a journeyman weaver, affirmed, that being acquainted with the proceedings of Mr. Smith and Mrs. Timmings, and being in the habit of going of errands and the like for her hu&s;band, in con&s;equence of &s;ome conver&s;ation with Thomas Gillett, his fellow-witne&s;s, upon the &s;ubject, he was &s;et by him to watch them in the yard into which the kitchen window opened; this was on the evening of the 10th of January. Through a crevice in the &s;ame he could &s;ee almo&s;t every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, he then ob&s;er|ved, that on the maid's going out and leaving James Smith and Mrs. Timmings by them&s;elves, Smith took and ki&s;&s;ed her, and put his hands up her petticoats &s;everal times; in a &s;hort time after, Smith got up from his chair, and he &s;aw them both move towards the window, Mrs. Timmings moving in her chair; when they came quite clo&s;e to the window he could not &s;ee particularly what pa&s;|&s;ed, any further than that Smith was upon her, and that both their bodies were in moiton for &s;ome minutes; af|ter which he &s;aw Mr. Smith get up and &s;it in the chair he was in before. He then left them, and informed Gil|lett of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 12th of January, it &s;eems only two days after, about eight in the evening, Gillett came again to him and informed him that Mr. Smith was there, and further de|&s;ired him to re&s;ume his old &s;tation&mdash;He did &s;o, and through the &s;ame crevice ob&s;erved that the maid-&s;ervant went out as before; and as Mrs. Timmings and Mr. Smith then &s;at oppo&s;ite to him, he could very well &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed; he then very plainly ob&s;erved Smith put his left arm round her neck, and while &s;he laid her head upon his &s;houlders, he put his right hand up her petticoats and after remaining &s;o about a minute, he got up, and
<PB N="175" REF="033585_0175_0FF79130CDBA1578">
having unbuttoned his breeches, the witne&s;s plainly &s;aw him pull up her petticoats &s;o far, that while he placed him&s;elf between her thighs, he could plainly &s;ee them na|ked on each &s;ide of him. He then again ob&s;erved their bodies in motion.</P>
<P>But what is the mo&s;t remarkable, while the witne&s;s was in this &s;ituation, Mr. Timmings, who was privy to his be|ing placed there, occa&s;ionly came into the yard, and a&s;k|ed him if he had &s;een any thing indecent between the parties? It was about nine o'clock when Mr. Timmings fir&s;t came to him upon this curious enquiry. He al&s;o came again at the critical moment, when Smith was plac|ing him&s;elf upon his wife, which he took a view of through the crevice; and immediately after going and opening the kitchen-door, he went up to Smith, pu&s;hed him off his wife, called him a villain, a&s;ked him what bu&s;ine&s;s he had there, and afterwards turned him out of the hou&s;e&mdash; He then called Gillett, and told him to go and fetch Mrs. Timmings, his mother&mdash;Gillett, on Smith's getting up from Mrs. Timmings, ob&s;erved that the flap of his breech|es was quite down.</P>
<P>As a ca&s;e in point, and &s;omething relevelant to Mr. Timmings's patient waiting at the kitchen-window to &s;ee the completion of Mr. Smith's amour with Mrs. Tim|mings, we mu&s;t mention a Benedict, or rather a Jerry Sneak, in the neighbourhood of Barbican, who u&s;ed to be &s;ent for liquor while a vi&s;itor of his wife's was left a|lone with her. When he returned from the&s;e errands, upon being let into the apartment, he would frequently &s;ay, "he had been at the door a good while!" and if he was a&s;ked by his wife and her gallant why he did not come in? his reply was, "Becau&s;e I thought you might be <HI>bu&s;y!</HI>"</P>
<P>To a further interrogation, the witne&s;s &s;aid, that on the night of the 12th of January Mrs. Timmings &s;aid to her hu&s;band, Pray forgive me this time, and I'll do &s;o no more! and that he never heard her make any other confe&s;&s;ion whatever. To this he added, that no threats or promi&s;es were made u&s;e of to extort it from her at
<PB N="176" REF="033585_0176_0FF79136150EB770">
that time. Of her di&s;po&s;ition, he added it as his opinion, that &s;he is a woman of &s;uch a &s;imple and un&s;u&s;picious turn, that any artful per&s;on might ea&s;ily make her declare what had never occurred.</P>
<P>Mary Gibbs, &s;ervant to Mr. Daniel Timmings, &s;aid, that &s;oon after &s;he came to live there &s;he u&s;ed to ob&s;erve a man, a &s;tranger, to her, come backwards and forwards to the hou&s;e in Union-&s;treet, whom her mi&s;tre&s;s after|wards told her was a Mr. James Barbett, a per&s;on who &s;he knew before &s;he was married, and had been her &s;weet|heart. About three weeks after this witne&s;s came to live there, &s;he recollects carrying a note to him from Mrs. Timmings to where Mr. Barbett lived, in Stewart-&s;treet near Union-&s;treet. From that time till the 13th of January la&s;t &s;he carried &s;everal notes to the &s;ame per&s;on from her mi&s;tre&s;s, in con&s;equence of which he came to the hou&s;e &s;everal evenings, but always when Mr. Tim|mings was ab&s;ent, and would &s;tay with Mrs. Timmings half or three quarters of an hour at a time: at the&s;e times Mr. Barbett and her mi&s;tre&s;s were generally alone in the parlour on the ground-floor; and &s;he frequently heard him ki&s;s her when he went away. Another time, as they were in the kitchen, &s;he &s;aw him put his arm round her wai&s;t and upon her brea&s;t, and ob&s;erved that her hand|kerchief appeared tumbled; this was at a time when &s;he had left them together near three quarters of an hour. After Mr. Barbett was gone away, her mi&s;tre&s;s told her, that if ever any thing &s;hould happen, and &s;he and Mr. Timmings &s;hould part, Mr. Barbett had repeatedly promi&s;ed to take care of her. Another time, after re|turning from a walk on the Hackney road, &s;he told this witne&s;s that Mr. Barbett and &s;he had been and eaten chee&s;e-cakes together at a hou&s;e on the way, and that he had a&s;&s;ured her he would never for&s;ake her!&mdash;Simplici|ty with a witne&s;s!&mdash;And, as a further proof of this di&s;|po&s;ition, according to the te&s;timony of Mary Gibbs, the confidant, Mr. Barbett was once going by the door, and being called into the parlour by Mr. Timmings to exa|mine him about his connection with Mrs Timmings,
<PB N="177" REF="033585_0177_0FF79137AD37FD20">
Barbett &s;aid to her, Did I ever know you? to which &s;he immediately replied, Yes, Sir, you know you did, this very night four weeks, on this very carpet! &s;tamping her foot upon the place at the &s;ame time. She then went into the kitchen, where Mrs. Amey Barker and the deponent then were, when addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to them, &s;he &s;aid, Though he denies it here, he can't deny it in a court of ju&s;tice: &s;he then laughed, and the conver&s;ation ended for that night. The next night, it &s;eems, Mrs. Barker, and Mrs. Grace Timmings being pre&s;ent, the latter &s;aid to Mrs. Timmings, "How can I a&s;k my &s;on to forgive you, when you know you have been that wicked woman before? and proceeded thus: "Nancy, who was it that gave you the bad di&s;temper? was it Mr. Barbett or Mr. Carre?" to which &s;he replied, "It was Mr. Barbett:" and being further a&s;ked what &s;he took for it? &s;he an&s;wer|ed, Bitter aloes, jalap, and brandy. And further this witne&s;s could not depo&s;e.</P>
<P>But to another article &s;he an&s;wered, that Mr. J. Smith came to their hou&s;e &s;ometimes twice a day, and that one night going away about 10 o'clock, he ki&s;&s;ed Mrs. Tim|mings twice; they al&s;o tickled one another, but on his putting his hand upon her brea&s;t, &s;he immediately de&s;ired this witne&s;s, the maid, to put the wine upon the table, and go upon an errand, which &s;he accordingly did, and left them together till 12 o'clock.</P>
<P>From her te&s;timony it al&s;o appeared, that on the 12th of January, when Mrs. Timmings's connection was di&s;|covered with Mr. Smith, Mr. Timmings had talked of going to Greenwich, but returned home unexpectedly, after being ab&s;ent about half an hour. On the maid's opening the door to him, &s;eeing him confu&s;ed, &s;he a&s;ked him what was the matter? in an&s;wer, he de&s;ired her to go and a&s;k her mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he then went into the kitchen and found her mi&s;tre&s;s with Mrs. Grace Timmings and her fellow-witne&s;s, Thomas Mount&mdash;her mi&s;tre&s;s was then crying, and &s;aid to her in the pre&s;ence of all the com|pany, "I have committed adultery with Mr. Smith, and your ma&s;ter has turned him out of doors!"</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="033585_0178_0FF7913943A14E58">Amey Barker, wife of Edward Barker, a ma&s;ter in his Maje&s;ty's navy, in Paradi&s;e Row, Rotherhithe, depo&s;ed, that &s;he well knew James Barbett, by &s;eeing him &s;everal times at Mr. Timmings's hou&s;e in Union-&s;treet: and that one night in December 1790, in particular, &s;he &s;aw a light in the window of the back parlour, on which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Timmings had company that might be &s;trangers to her; on this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;he went up to the window and as there was a vacancy between the &s;hutters, &s;he could plainly &s;ee every part of the room, and, to her great &s;urprize, then &s;aw Ann Timmings laying upon the carpet, her petticoats were drawn quite up, and a man laying upon her; in this &s;ituation they continued &s;ome minutes during which &s;he is certain &s;he &s;aw their bodies move, and was well convinced they had a mutual knowledge of each other in a carnal way. And in con|firmation of this idea, &s;he afterwards ob&s;erved James Bar|bett button up his breeches, and Ann Timmings go and &s;it down in a chair in a very pen&s;ive manner; but as &s;he heard &s;omebody coming along the &s;treet, &s;he left the place, and returned to her &s;i&s;ter's.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o her opinion, that Mr. Timmings had con|tracted the venereal di&s;ea&s;e from no other per&s;on but his wife, and &s;he was fully per&s;uaded that he had never treat|ed her with cruelty or violence.</P>
<P>But &s;till the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing part of this evidence was, that Mrs. Amey Barker depo&s;ed, that Mrs. Timmings was a woman of &s;uch a pliable and un&s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;i|tion, as very ea&s;ily to be impo&s;ed upon; and &s;eemingly as a proof of this a&s;&s;everation, the next part of the depo|&s;ition that followed, expre&s;&s;ed that James Barbett and Ann Timmings had ab&s;olutely committed adultery to|gether, about the 15th of the month of December 1790, upon Mrs. Timmings's parlour-floor in Duke-&s;treet, while &s;he, Mrs. Barker, was &s;itting at the window be|tween &s;even and eight o'clock in the evening. This tran&s;action, &s;he ob&s;erved, &s;he never informed Mr. Tim|mings of, but added, that he &s;poke of it to her about

the latter end of January la&s;t, which was the fir&s;t time &s;he was appri&s;ed of his knowing of it!</P>
<P>Mary Gibbs al&s;o depo&s;ed, that Mr. and Mrs. Tim|mings and Mr. Smith all &s;upped together one night; and that afterwards about ten o'clock Mr. Timmings went out and left Smith and his wife together a con&s;iderable time; during which, &s;he was witne&s;s to their u&s;ual intimacies of ki&s;&s;ing, and the like.</P>
<P>But this, though the concluding part of the evidence, was not the only appearance of connivance, to &s;ay no|thing of Mrs. Barker's pre&s;ence during the parlour-floor &s;cene.

<P>Q. Where did you live before this?&mdash;At Mr. Stagoths, the Nag's Head, Po&s;tern-row, Little Tower-hill.</P>
<P>Q. Is the Beehive a hou&s;e of reputation, or is it a hou&s;e where men and women come?&mdash;It is.</P>
<P>Q. Is it a hou&s;e of good reputation, or is it a hou&s;e of ill fame, that receives all &s;orts of men and wo|men?&mdash;All &s;orts of men and women come there.</P>
<P>Q. Do the loo&s;e women come there?&mdash;Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Who placed you as a &s;ervant there?&mdash;Mr. Carty's other girl came to my mother, and told her they wanted a maid. I hired my&s;elf there; my mother was bad in bed: my mother knew I hired my&s;elf there; &s;he lived about four doors off, where &s;he had lived but a fortnight, and I had been in the neighbourhood but two days. On the 20th of March, Wedne&s;day night when I went there the fir&s;t night, the pri&s;oner was drinking along with Mrs. Carty, and he laid hold of me, and &s;aid I was a pretty girl; I told him to keep his hands to him&s;elf: I &s;aw him again the next day in the &s;ame hou&s;e, when he laid hold of me, and I again told him to keep his hands to him&s;elf; Mrs. Car|ty laughed at it. The next day he came again, and ordered half a pint of gin to go upon Bunker's-hill; he did not live there, I did not know the hou&s;e; my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tre&s;s called me out of the wa&s;h-hou&s;e, and &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it. I followed him with the gin; he went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; I went to the door, and I &s;aid Here is the gin&punc; there was a woman in the room, (I &s;taid at the door, the door was open) and the table be|fore her, and there was a tea-cup on the table; I
<PB N="181" REF="033585_0181_0FF77DD2DCAA8810">
gave him the half-pint of gin, and the woman &s;aid, Come in here, my dear, there is nobody here will hurt you. I did not go any further than the door all the time. I was waiting for the mea&s;ure; he took the gin out of my hand at the door. Mrs. Carty told me to bring the mea&s;ure back again, or take notice where it was going, as it was a &s;trange hou&s;e. The woman got up and laid hold of me to pull me in, and pu&s;hed me in, and &s;aid I am going for a farthing-worth of thread, and &s;he would be in in a minute. I laid hold of her to go after her, and &s;he would not let me, &s;he pu&s;hed me in and pul|led the door after her, and this man came and lock|ed the door, and put the key in his pocket; and he laid hold of me, and there was a bureau bed-&s;tead in the room, and he laid hold of one of my hands, and he was going to pull the bed&s;tead down; with that I &s;creamed out, and he took his hat off and put it on my face; there was &s;omething in the hat that catched me, that &s;trangled me, that pre&s;&s;ed on my throat! I had a half guinea in my pocket, that my mother gave me in the morning; I told him I would give it him if he would let me go; this was ju&s;t as he was going to put the hat on my face. No, by Chri&s;t! &s;ays he, I will have my revenge of you now: he had a great coat on, he wrapped it round me and flung me down on the floor; he put &s;ome|thing in my private parts that cut me: I was co|vered all the while.</P>
<P>Q. Was it far in your private parts?&mdash;Yes it was.</P>
<P>Q. When you &s;ay it cut you, do you mean a &s;harp in&s;trument; or that it tore your private parts?&mdash; It tore them.</P>
<P>Q. And he lay his body on your's?&mdash;Yes, he did.</P>
<P>Q. How long did he lay on you?&mdash;I cannot right|ly &s;ay. I fainted away in the hat; when I reco|vered, I was laying on the floor; he was on me &s;till;

he get off from me then; and when I got up, I found my&s;elf all blood.</P>
<P>Q. On what part of your body?&mdash;All my &s;hift and my private parts; I never had been before this out of order</P>
<P>Q. Do you mean you never had tho&s;e di&s;charges which are common to your &s;ex?&mdash;I never had be|fore: he then opened the door, and I was going out; when I recovered my&s;elf, he pulled me back again; &s;ays he, Where is the half guinea you was going to give a while ago? I told him, if he had let me go, I would have given it him then: he &s;aid, I have had your maidenhead, and I will have that too; he then laid hold and pulled my pocket off from my &s;ide; from the pull he gave it, I thought my back was broke in two; he took my pocket and all there was in it, a red pocket-book; he kept all that was in the pocket: the half guinea was in the pock|et, in the pocket-book: there was al&s;o a pocket-book in it, and a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and two-pence half|penny in copper, three of them crooked, and two farthings; and when I came home to Mrs. Carty's, I could hardly walk. I went backwards and wa&s;h|ed my&s;elf. I went out with a pint of beer after|wards, and I went to my mother, but &s;he was not at home. I went out about fifteen minutes after|wards, and went again &s;everal times that day, and &s;he was not at home; I &s;aw her that night; &s;he was in bed, it was about &s;even o'clock &s;he looked out of the window, but &s;he could not come down; I told her I wanted to &s;peak to her very particularly. I was in the court, and I called to her; the window opens into the court: &s;he told me to come in the morning, becau&s;e my father was a&s;leep: the next day I went about eight o'clock in the morning; &s;he was in bed, I went up &s;tairs to her, and I told her what had happened: &s;he a&s;ked me if I told my ma&s;|ter, I told her I had not, becau&s;e of my character:

<P>Q. How long did you know Carty before your daughter was placed in this &s;ervice?&mdash;I did not know them at all; I came down from living in Whitechapel into this hou&s;e, where I am at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. Had you made any enquiry into the character of Carty's hou&s;e, or did you know what kind of a hou&s;e it was?&mdash;The maid that lives at Carty's, cal|led at my hou&s;e for pots, and &s;he a&s;ked me if my girl wanted a place, my being ill at the &s;ame time; I &s;aid that I would not wi&s;h her to go and live in that hou&s;e, a public-hou&s;e, e&s;pecially an Iri&s;h hou&s;e.

Having been very ill, and having five children, the younge&s;t &s;ix years old, and this pre&s;ent man not their father, I told the girl to go after it for a little time, till I got better, and I would get her into a private hou&s;e; &s;he went after it and hired her&s;elf, and was to have four guineas a year, and that morn|ing &s;he was hired; I was going to the ho&s;pital, and I gave her the half guinea to pay for her &s;hoes &s;ole|ing and heel-piecing.</P>

<P>Q. How did you procure this half guinea, as you was a poor woman?&mdash;I had been &s;aving it to buy a gown, &s;o put by half a crown a week unknown to my hu&s;band. I &s;aved it to buy the children &s;ome|thing.</P>
<P>Q. Do you recollect where you was during the Friday?&mdash;I was down at an acquaintance of mine, being &s;o very ill, and &s;he kept me to drink a di&s;h of tea, and I could hardly crawl home at &s;ix o'clock.</P>
<P>Q. What was your acquaintance's name?&mdash;Her name is Mrs. Smith, &s;he lives in Cartwright-&s;treet in that neighbourhood; and I came home, and my hu&s;band came directly after me, and I laid down directly, being &s;o very ill, and he had a bit of &s;up|per and laid down before eight o'clock; we were all in bed before eight o'clock, children and all.</P>

<P>Q. Did you tell your hu&s;band of it?&mdash;I did not,
<PB N="185" REF="033585_0185_0FF7914C30DB9180">
upon my word, becau&s;e he is the &s;econd father; my hu&s;band is a hard working man.</P>
<P>Q. In what manner does your pre&s;ent hu&s;band behave to this child by your fir&s;t hu&s;band?&mdash;Very fond of her, but not altogether as if he was her own father.</P>
<P>Q. Why did not you tell him?&mdash;I did not tell him indeed. As &s;oon as I could crawl out of doors I went to Mr. Daw&s;on the officer, this was on Sa|turday, 7, 8, or 9, days after, I told it to Mr. Daw|&s;on; he is a peace-officer, his wife was pre&s;ent, he is here now.</P>

<HEAD>The extraordinary Trial between Lady Elizabeth Weld and her hu&s;band, Ed|ward Weld, E&s;q. for Impotency. In the Arches Court of Canterbury, Lon|don; 1732.</HEAD>
<P>THE coun&s;el for the pro&s;ecution &s;tated, that Edward Weld E&s;q. married the Honourable Catharine-Elizabeth, daughter of Lord A&s;ton, June 22, 1727, he being aged 22, and the lady 19. That after his marriage he coha|bited with his wife at his &s;eat at Lulworth Ca&s;tle, in Dor&s;et&s;hire, till June, 1728, excepting one month, wherein, being indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;he came to London for ad|vice, from whence &s;he went to the &s;eat of her father, at Standon, in Hertford&s;hire, where her hu&s;band followed her in the October following, and cohabited with her about a month, and then returned to Lulworth, where he continued till February 1728-9, and came back to his wife at her father's &s;eat, and &s;taid with her about three

weeks; he then left her there a &s;econd time, and went home to Lulworth Ca&s;tle, and continued there till the end of May following, and then returned to her again for one week; after which they both came to London, and cohabited as man and wife about &s;ix weeks. During all tho&s;e times of cohabitation, &s;he &s;aid, he never, (by rea&s;on of impotency) con&s;ummated his marriage, though he acknowledged her to be able, apt, and fit for the pro|creation of children: his wife, therefore, would no longer cohabit with him, though urged by him to it, by his tell|ing her that "Many married people had lived together like brother and &s;i&s;ter:"&mdash;To which &s;he replied, "My dear, we ought not to live together after this manner!"</P>
<P>All our fair readers will agree with Mrs. Weld, that a married &s;tate ought to be quite another manner of life from that of brother and &s;i&s;ter; and the lady mu&s;t be e&s;teemed blamele&s;s in commencing this &s;uit, as &s;he was her&s;elf, and her hu&s;band likewi&s;e, a Roman Catholic; e&s;pecially, as by their religion, matrimony is looked up|on to be a &s;acrament&mdash;And it is further under&s;tood by tho&s;e of that per&s;ua&s;ion, that this &s;acrament is violated by &s;uch as continue in the married &s;tate while they are con|&s;cious to them&s;elves that they cannot an&s;wer the holy ends of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el then produced Lord A&s;ton, who depo&s;ed, that Mr. Weld and Mr. Colclough being at his hou&s;e in Hertford&s;hire, in May 1728; he de&s;ired Mr. Colclough to &s;peak to Mr. Weld about his Not having con&s;ummated the marriage with his daughter. Mr. Colclough declared he had &s;poke to him, and he confe&s;&s;ed he had Not con|&s;ummated his marriage with the &s;aid Mrs. Weld, and that he had &s;ome outward defect that was painful to him, and hindered him from con&s;ummating his marriage. Mr. Colclough then recommended one Mr. Williams to Mr. Weld, who had cured him of a &s;imilar di&s;order; and after this it &s;eems, Mr. Weld told the witne&s;s at the lady Howard's, that Mr. Williams had cured him, though that &s;ome &s;orene&s;s remained, but he did not doubt but he &s;hould be well in a little time.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="033585_0192_0FF791568199DDC8">The Duke of Norfolk depo&s;ed, that in June 1728, when he talked to Mr. Weld about the affair, he acknow|ledged he had not con&s;ummated his marriage with the Honourable Mi&s;s. A&s;ton, but had advi&s;ed with phy&s;icians and hoped in a little time he &s;hould be able to con&s;um|mate it.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the certificate of three midwives was then produced; it was as follows:&mdash;</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="certificate">
<P>That they are well &s;killed in the art and practice of midwifery, and have very carefully and diligently in&s;pected the private parts of the body of the Hon. Catharine Elizabeth Weld, which are naturally de&s;igned for carnal copulation; and that to the be&s;t of their &s;kill and knowledge &s;he is a <HI>Vir|gin,</HI> and never had carnal copulation with any man what|&s;oever.</P>

<HEAD>The following Depo&s;itions were made in behalf of the Defendant&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>Edward Weld, E&s;q. depo&s;ed, that he was of the age of 26, and has all the parts of his body which con&s;titute a man perfect and entire, <HI>more particularly tho&s;e parts</HI> which nature formed for the propagation of his &s;pecies and the act of carnal copulation, in full and ju&s;t propor|tion, and was and is capable of carnally knowing Cathar|ine Elizabeth Weld, his wife, or any other woman. And that during the time he cohabited with his wife, his pri|vy-member was often <HI>turgid, dilated, and erected,</HI> as was nece&s;&s;ary to perform the act of carnal-copulation; and that he did at &s;uch times con&s;umate his marriage by car|nally lying with and knowing his wife.</P>
<P>Margaret Weld, the mother of Mrs. Weld, depo&s;ed, that within the &s;pace of a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, after the &s;olemnization of the marriage between her &s;on and the Hon. Mi&s;s A&s;ton, that her daughter-in-law being out of order, as breeding women u&s;ually are, informed the witne&s;s that &s;he did not know for certain that &s;he was not a breeding!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="033585_0193_0FF791584D59EC48">Mr. Williams, an eminent &s;urgeon, depo&s;ed, that Mr. Weld came to him in June 1728, and that upon examin|ing his penis, he found the frenum too &s;traight, which he &s;et at liberty by cliping it with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars; and on examining that part again the next day, found nothing ami&s;s in the organs of generation.</P>

<P>The following was then read, being the &s;ub&s;tance of the certificate of five &s;urgeons that had examined the Defendant:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="certificate">
<P>That they had carefully in&s;pected the parts of Ed|ward Weld, E&s;q. de&s;igned for propagation, and did find them fully and ju&s;tly proportioned, and fitly formed for the act of carnal copulation, and that it did evidently ap|pear to them that he was capable of performing every thing requi&s;ite to the propagation of his &s;pecies.</P>

<P>The Court having heard the above evidence, decreed that Mrs.-Weld &s;hould be enjoined to <HI>perpetual &s;ilence</HI> on the&s;e premi&s;es, and that &s;he &s;hould go and cohabit with her hu&s;band at bed and board at Lulworth Ca&s;tle, or any other place of his abode.</P>
<P>After this &s;entence, there was an appeal to the King in his Court of Delegates. The cau&s;e was re-heard at Serjeant's Inn, and the foregoing &s;entence was confirmed!</P>
<P>To which we may very &s;afely venture to add, without fear of being guilty of a libel, that to impo&s;e a &s;entence of perpetual &s;ilence upon a woman, for its cruelty and inju&s;tice never before had any parrallel in the annals or law books of any chri&s;tian country whatever!</P>
