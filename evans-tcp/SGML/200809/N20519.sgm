<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is among the misfortunes that attend General Dumourier, to be abandoned by the world; to be the outca&s;t of &s;ociety; to be compelled to fly from city to city to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from the rage and madne&s;s of coun|trymen who imagine they will &s;erve the public cau&s;e and rid the world of a traitor if they can but plunge a dagger into his brea&s;t; and to avoid the wretch who&s;e avarice would tempt him to gain the price offered for his blood by the Convention. Compelled to live among &s;trangers under the di&s;gui&s;e of an a&s;&s;umed name, and to &s;ubmit to the pain of li&s;tening to opinions on his conduct, equally &s;evere and unju&s;t, that are indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by the hired journali&s;ts of the different courts of Eu|rope, who be&s;tow their prai&s;es only on the &s;uc|ce&s;sful, and every where encountering emi|grants, who dete&s;t him with little rea&s;on, and as much ferocity as the jacobins, this man, whom Mini&s;ters and Courts received with flattering care&s;&s;es When he quitted the army, but afterwards calumniated and per&s;ecuted, for having publi&s;hed memorials which con|tained his real and &s;erious opinions, at length obeys the call of his duty, by giving to the world the Memoirs of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="026918_0004_0FD25FD36A47EDC8">
The mo&s;t extravagant and contradictory tales re&s;pecting him have filled the journals of Europe, and portraits have been drawn of him &s;o unlike each other, that not only his charac|ter, but his exi&s;tence is become an enigma.</P>
<P>The Courier of Europe repre&s;ents him with the force of Hercules, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Mark Anthony, the treachery of Hanni|bal, the cruelty of Sylla, and the military and political talents of Cae&s;ar; they have al&s;o attributed to him, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of immen&s;e riches in the Engli&s;h funds. On the contra|ry the Journal of the Lower Rhine de&s;cribes him as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing talents, but being defi|cient in judgment. This opinion, Dumou|rier regards as true prai&s;e, for he was never de&s;irous of being thought &s;ubtile or practi&s;ed in the art of changing his opinions according to his intere&s;ts. He has always had fixed principles and a determined character. His mind was formed by the &s;tudy of Plutarch; and he has mixed too little with men, to be known by any but a &s;elect few. Excep|ting during his travels and his wars, he has lived &s;urrounded only by his books, and his cho&s;en friends, of whom the greater part no longer exi&s;t. Far from e&s;teeming the ma|xim of the Epicureans, which recommends the concealment of our actions, his whole life &s;hall be expo&s;ed to the ob&s;ervation and judgment of his contemporaries. He has nothing to lo&s;e by his conduct; already he is poor, calumniated, pro&s;cribed, all that mankind regard as mi&s;erable; but he has every thing to gain, &s;ince men of elevated
<PB N="vii" REF="026918_0005_0FD25F92EAE73338">
and upright minds, who read the&s;e Memoirs, will become his friends. With &s;uch men only he de&s;ires to live, and to whatever na|tion they belong, he &s;hall always regard them as his fellow citizens.</P>
<P>The celebrated Dictator Fabius Maximus, he who alone could check the victories of Hannibal, and whom Dumourier earne&s;tly endeavoured to imitate in his campaign a|gain&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, made this ob&s;er|vation to Paulus Emilius, when he went with Varro, to command the army, <HI>"Let him not fear who thir&s;ts for glory; for, although we often find that true merit is eclip&s;ed for a time, we have never known it to be entirely lo&s;t; it bur&s;ts at la&s;t through the clouds which encircle it, and appears arrayed in its bright and genuine co|lours.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dumourier thought like Fabius, but their &s;ituations were widely different. Fabius re|&s;ided on his e&s;tate with his, family, expo&s;ed indeed to the calumnies of a faction, but honoured in the Senate, and by all the &s;ages of Rome. They &s;till regarded his coun&s;els and pre&s;erved him in the command of the army, nor had ingratitude effaced the many &s;ervices he had hitherto rendered his coun|try, or de&s;troyed the expectation of his &s;till rendering them many more. Fabius was thus enabled to follow the bent of his mild and moderate di&s;po&s;ition; and wait, in tranquillity, the progre&s;s of truth and ju&s;|tice. Such are not the happy circum&s;tances of Dumourier; and however &s;hort a time he may have to live, it will be too long if
<PB N="viii" REF="026918_0006_0FD25FD4E9DE0098">
it be &s;tained with the inju&s;tice of the public opinion. Not only therefore for him&s;elf, his contemporaries, and his country to whom he may one day be u&s;eful, but in ju&s;tice to his friends, his relations, his advocates, he is obliged to repel the calumnies which follow him, and to di&s;&s;ipate the cloud which ob|&s;cures the truth. This he will do by an ho|ne&s;t and accurate detail of &s;uch facts as are important, and of which he was a competent witne&s;s.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons he is obliged to change the order of his Memoirs, and to &s;ubmit to the public opinion the third volume, which contains the circum&s;tances of the year 1793. The&s;e are the more important as they will enable the reader to fore&s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;trange events that have lately happened in Europe, in &s;tudying the nature of their mo|tives and cau&s;es. If General Dumourier have &s;tated any of them erroneou&s;ly, his contem|poraries are competent to dete&s;t his inju&s;|tice, but he has &s;urely this great rea&s;on for &s;peaking the truth, that he may not increa&s;e the number of his enemies. He de&s;cribes the French as they really are, and not &s;uch as Europe has hitherto regarded them, who &s;eem to believe that the whole French na|tion are without religion, without honour, or humanity. The French are engaged in a bad cau&s;e. We are compelled to regard them with horror; but prudence will not permit us to de&s;pi&s;e them. They have di&s;|played a magnificent courage; and, had they followed the opinion of virtuous and expe|rienced
<PB N="ix" REF="026918_0007_0FD25F976ECD1440">
men, this period of their hi&s;tory would have been as honourable as it is now di&s;graceful and wretched.</P>
<P>Unhappily, their licentious exce&s;&s;es have de&s;troyed the liberties of Europe. The ex|ample of their misfortunes, has induced every people to believe that they had better wear their chains in peace, than fall into an anarchy that can never end but in ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>There are two que&s;tions that naturally pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to which Dumourier's ju&s;tifi|cation ought to reply, by &s;tating the mo|tives of his conduct, which appears to be in contradiction with his own opinions.</P>
<P>It is a&s;ked, <HI>why did Dumourier, after the arre&s;t of Louis on the 10th of Augu&s;t, refu&s;e to obey the orders that he had received from another general, to make the &s;oldiers renew their oath of fidelity to the king</HI>?</P>
<P>Dumourier had then under his command <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 men in the camp of Maulde near Tournay, and the Au&s;trians who had a much larger army, were indefatigable in harra&s;&s;ing his troops. Dillon had been &s;ent to remove the general in his command. The mini&s;ters were then evidently inimical to the revo|lution; and, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;econd volume of the&s;e Memoirs, pur&s;ued a conduct that was the cau&s;e of the king's misfortunes. The circum&s;tances of the frightful &s;cene of the 10th of Augu&s;t, were not accurately known in the camp. To engage the troops to renew their oath, according to the or|ders of General Dillon, was to prejudge
<PB N="x" REF="026918_0008_0FD25FD66BAC0208">
the cau&s;e of the people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dard of rebellion again&s;t the nation, and to engage the army in a di&s;pute re&s;pecting par|ties, at the very moment when we had a &s;o|reign enemy to combat; and the inevitable con&s;equence would have been to have ex|po&s;ed the unfortunate Louis to the daggers and vengeance of the populace.</P>
<P>Again it is demanded, <HI>how can Dumourier ju&s;tify his conduct at the time when a Convention was appointed for the purpo&s;e of aboli&s;hing the monarchy and e&s;tabli&s;hing a republic, in acknow|ledging the authority of this Convention, giving his &s;anction to the de&s;truction of the monarchy, and to the a&s;&s;umed power of the republic.</HI></P>
<P>It was &s;hortly after the general's refu&s;al to give the oath to the troops in the camp of Maulde, that Fayette de&s;erted from his ar|my, and Dumourier was ordered to take the command in his &s;tead. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia entered Champagne with a formidable body of troops; and terror and trea&s;on en&s;ured his &s;ucce&s;s. Longwi and Verdun were taken. Dumourier, being in force in his camp at Grandpre, a&s;&s;embled his army at St. Mane|hould. The hi&s;tory of France does not pre|&s;ent &s;o dangerous a cri&s;is. The 20th of September, the day on which the Conven|tion declared France to be a republic, Du|mourier and Kellerman repul&s;ed the Pru&s;|&s;ians, who had attacked them at Valary. The two armies were in &s;ight of each other and every day threatened to come to an engagement; and this &s;urely was not the moment to enter into quarrels re&s;pecting the
<PB N="xi" REF="026918_0009_0FD25F9B41D767B0">
form of government! The enemy were to be driven from the territories of France. The country was to be &s;aved. Be&s;ides, the people were incen&s;ed again&s;t the king, whom they regarded as a traitor. At &s;uch a period to have maintained his prerogative, would have been the &s;ignal for his ma&s;&s;acre. The people would have looked upon &s;uch an at|tempt as an act of treachery, which would have deprived Dumourier of the confidence of his countrymen, and thereby have left France an ea&s;y prey to the enemy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Pru&s;&s;ians had retreated, Dumourier began the campaign in the Low Countries, and it was not till he had gaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Belgians for allies, and had acquired in|fluence by his &s;ucce&s;s, that he had any rea|&s;on to hope that he could give peace to his country, deliver the impri&s;oned king, and e&s;tabli&s;h on &s;ecure foundations the con&s;titu|tion of 1789. After that period, circum|&s;tances aro&s;e &s;o extremely contrary to all po&s;&s;ible expectation, Dumourier's journey to Paris, and the horrible murder of Louis XVI. &s;o clearly convinced Dumourier of the guilty aims of the Convention, and the im|placability and power of the Jacobins, that the general re&s;olved at all hazards to &s;epa|rate the cau&s;e of the country from that of the mon&s;ters by whom it was governed. His plan was bold. No other per&s;on in France had means in his power, for that purpo&s;e, &s;o apparently well founded. But every cir|cum&s;tance turned again&s;t him, and, above all, the incon&s;tancy of his army.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="026918_0010_0FD25FD831F7FE00">
The apparent contradiction between Du|mourier's political principles and his mili|tary conduct have drawn upon him the un|ju&s;t reproaches of many of the Emigrants, and of &s;everal per&s;ons of good &s;en&s;e, who could only judge from their mi&s;taken view of the facts. As mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, Dumourier certainly has &s;hewn a &s;incere at|tachment to the Con&s;titution; of this his di&s;patches, his di&s;cour&s;es to the A&s;&s;embly, are an abundant proof. He has equally op|po&s;ed Republicans and Royali&s;ts. He pro|cured the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of three mini&s;ters of the former party, without leaguing him&s;elf with the court faction, and in con&s;equence he was expo&s;ed to the fury of the Jacobins, who loudly demanded his being &s;ent to the pri&s;on of Orleans. The public opinion of Dumourier's principles at that period, was &s;o decided, that the following couplet was placed at the bottom of his portrait.
<Q><L>Inflexible &s;outien du trone, et de la loi,</L>
<L>Il fut ami du peuple, il fut ami du Roi <NOTE PLACE="foot">Inflexible &s;upporter of the throne and of the law, he was at once the friend of the people and of the king</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>Afterwards appointed to the command of the army, he had neither time nor inclina|tion to concern him&s;elf in the intrigues and crimes of Paris. He was &s;olely employed in repelling the enemy.</P>
<P>He is reproached, however, with never having changed his party, till he was no longer victorious, but the reproach is un|ju&s;t;
<PB N="xiii" REF="026918_0011_0FD25F9CB09B6F88">
for, in the fir&s;t place, he never chang|ed his party, &s;ince, although he quitted the Republicans, with whom he had been long di&s;|gu&s;ted, yet he did not join the Royali&s;ts; and that no doubt might remain re&s;pecting his opi|nion, he in&s;tantly proclaimed his de&s;ire of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the con&s;titution of 1789. Se|condly, his &s;entiments were con&s;tantly in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the Convention, the Jacobins, and the Mini&s;ter of War, during the time of his expedition into Belgia, from the month of November, as may be &s;een in his corre&s;pondence with Pache, publi&s;hed in January 1793. In this &s;ame month of January, he &s;ent to the Convention four memorials, again&s;t the tyrannical decree of the 15th of December, and he neither pre|&s;ented him&s;elf to the Convention, nor the &s;ociety of Jacobins; on the contrary, he gave in his re&s;ignation at that period. Third|ly, compelled for his per&s;onal &s;afety to re|turn to the army, he per&s;evered in oppo&s;|ing the tyranny and inju&s;tice of the Con|vention. It was on the 12th of March that he wrote the well-known letter to the Con|vention, which was con&s;idered by the Jaco|bins as &s;o great a crime. Hence, before he went to engage the Prince of Cobourg, and to decide the fate of France, and her ene|mies on the plains of Nerwinde, his quar|rel with the Convention was open and pro|claimed. He was pro&s;cribed. He was, therefore, compelled to overthrow the Con|vention, or peri&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="026918_0012_0FD25FDE59F66490">
The reproach that General Dumourier never quitted the Republican party till he was vanqui&s;hed, was expre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t bitterne&s;s, in a letter written by the Elector of Cologne, to the General, which was publi&s;hed with a cruel o&s;tenta|tion which that prince might have foreborne again&s;t a man then unfortunate and a fugi|tive. But &s;urely it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this Prince will regret the inju&s;tice done to General Dumourier, when, by the reading of the&s;e Memoirs, he &s;hall be convinced that it is an inju&s;tice. None of the wrongs the General has endured, has afflicted him &s;o much as this, &s;ince the author of it is held in &s;uch ju&s;t e&s;timation throughout Eu|rope.</P>
<P>Every nation in Europe mu&s;t be con|vinced, that its mo&s;t important intere&s;ts are involved in the cata&s;trophe of the French Revolution. If the belligerent powers &s;hould re-e&s;tabli&s;h the monarchy, the vengeance of the nobles, and con&s;equent pro&s;criptions will fall on the greater part of the people. But, as the people are fortunately the mo&s;t numerous body, as they have enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty, and felt the advan|tage of holding the &s;overeign power in their hands, the triumph of the nobility and clergy, would be but momentary; it will endure no longer than while the foreign troops are enabled to &s;upport them. Every day will be productive of fre&s;h rebellions, and another Revolution &s;till more de&s;truc|tive
<PB N="xv" REF="026918_0013_0FD25F9E5017DF80">
and terrible than the pre&s;ent, will re|&s;tore the people to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ove|reignty. But if, by the imbecility of the allied powers, the National Convention and the Jacobins are enabled to maintain the republic, then will their &s;y&s;tem of frater|nization be exerci&s;ed with irre&s;i&s;tible &s;orce; and finally, not only the neighbouring na|tions, but the mo&s;t di&s;tant countries will imitate the rebellion of France, and all Eu|rope be reduce to a &s;tate of anarchy, while by a grand and rapid Revolution, the exi&s;t|ing governments of the world will be ha|&s;tened to de&s;truction. There is a ju&s;t me|dium, however, which the &s;en&s;ible part of the French nation eagerly de&s;ire to be a|dopted, and which would in&s;ure general tranquillity to Europe; it is that France &s;hould become a limited monarchy.</P>
<P>It is to this end the &s;overeigns of Eu|rope ought to direct their efforts; and it is by &s;o doing only they can &s;ecure the &s;afety of the monarch who &s;hall mount the throne of France. It is the only bond of univer&s;al peace.</P>
<P>If it be true that the ancient monarchy cannot be re&s;tored in France, it is no le&s;s certain that the &s;pecies of Democracy, which exi&s;ts there at pre&s;ent, cannot be of long duration.</P>
<P>Ab&s;tract notions have been too much con&s;ulted in this important matter, which may ea&s;ily be reduced to a few &s;imple truths. There is no political con&s;titution which will
<PB N="xvi" REF="026918_0014_0FD25FE031ABE588">
not render a people happy, if it be the choice of the people, and if the govern|ment be enabled to act without any other re&s;traint than that of the law. The monar|chical form of government is exclu&s;ively &s;uited to large and populous nations, be|cau&s;e &s;uch only are enabled to provide for the expence of monarchy. The republican form is better &s;uited to &s;mall and poor coun|tries, becau&s;e it is admini&s;tered with le&s;s expence. In the former, there is a unity of power, which co&s;titutes the perfection of government; and it al&s;o includes &s;ecrecy and promptitude, without which great and complicated affairs cannot be &s;ucce&s;sfully conducted. Ari&s;tocracy is nece&s;&s;ary in a Republic; drawing together the authorities that otherwi&s;e would be without union, and excluding the tyranny that re&s;ults from the arbitrary will of a people governing them|&s;elves. Pure democracy will always pro|duce an incon&s;i&s;tent and ineffectual govern|ment, becau&s;e it neither admits of union of opinions, nor of prudence, promptitude, nor &s;ecrecy; and it includes in it&s;elf prin|ciples that beget di&s;orders among the peo|ple, and are entirely &s;ubver&s;ive of their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>All the Republics that we are acquainted with, ancient or modern, have been melio|rated by Ari&s;tocracy. We mu&s;t not even except Athens, which was devoid of &s;ucce&s;s and &s;plendor, excepting when its councils were directed by Ari&s;tides, Themi&s;tocles,
<PB N="xvii" REF="026918_0015_0FD25F9FA7DE2570">
Cymon, and Pericles; and was reduced to &s;lavery, at fir&s;t by Sparta, and afterwards by Philip of Macedon, when the demo|cracy triumphed, and when celebrated men were no longer at the head of its affairs.</P>
<P>The civilization of our manners, the ex|tent of our commerce, our wealth, our luxuries, in a word all the enjoyments on which are founded the &s;plendor and hap|pine&s;s of our age, are oppo&s;ed to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a Republic. If we will have a perfect equality among men for the ba&s;is of our political union, we mu&s;t go back to the &s;implicity of the fir&s;t ages, ca&s;t away our advantages, and return to a &s;tate of nature. A government founded on equality can be nothing more than the contract of a &s;avage people, who, for the fir&s;t time, have a&s;|&s;embled in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The French have erred &s;trangely in this re&s;pect. They compare them&s;elves to the fir&s;t Romans; but Brutus, in freeing Rome from the Tarquins who were dete&s;table ty|rants, in aboli&s;hing royalty, was better in|formed of the intere&s;ts of men, than to e&s;ta|bli&s;h equality and democracy. He pre&s;erved the royal authority while he divided it be|tween the Con&s;uls, to whom he left the Lictors, the Fa&s;ces, and the Ax, as well as all the real attributes of royalty. He new modelled the &s;overeign power, by ordaining that the hands which held it &s;hould be changed every year. Yet the Con&s;uls were taken from the Senate, that is to &s;ay, from
<PB N="xviii" REF="026918_0016_0FD25FE227BCB6D8">
the Ari&s;tocracy. Afterward, indeed, new changes took place in the government, when bold plebeians attacked the privileges of the &s;enate by their decemvirs and tribunes. But the government remained five hundred years an ari&s;tocracy; and when the people had made innovations, if the &s;enate had not conceived the &s;ublime policy of rendering the Roman people a nation of conquerors, its govern|ment would have re&s;embled that which we have &s;ince &s;een in the Republic of Florence: Always feeble, always agitated by civil wars, and open to the inva&s;ion of every ambitious neighbour, Rome would have been con|quered, or would have become, a dower, or a heritage like Florence; and &s;carcely would hi&s;tory have &s;poken of that city, which her ari&s;tocracy rendered the mo&s;t celebrated of the whole world.</P>
<P>But even this &s;pecies of republic which Brutus founded, and which may be con&s;i|dered as a mixed government, extending only over a &s;mall territory, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, after the death of Cae&s;ar, or Tiberius, or Nero. The circum&s;tances of the Roman Empire, at that period, would have de&s;troyed the Republican &s;pirit in its birth. The bounds of the empire were too much enlarged; the Romans were too rich; luxury, arts, and all the enjoyments that &s;pring from them, had &s;pread their influence too much to ac|cord with the au&s;terity of a Republic. And liberty does not nece&s;&s;arily demand a Re|publican

government. England is a proof, that a people may be free under a monarch. Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in being free from obedience to all laws but tho&s;e that the people them|&s;elves have made. The law is the &s;anc|tuary in which the &s;overeignty re&s;ides; and kings or other magi&s;trates to whom the exe|cutive power is delegated, being &s;ubject to the law, the people are as free as they can be con&s;i&s;tently with their happine&s;s. Such are the bounds of a true liberty, and all be|yond is anarchy.</P>
<P>Nothing can be better proved than that a republic cannot now be e&s;tabli&s;hed, without the de&s;truction of tho&s;e very advantages which di&s;tingui&s;h the age. We cannot ob|tain the object, without confounding pro|perty, and forcing the minds of men to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion by terror and crimes. To be a Re|public, we mu&s;t fir&s;t be in a &s;tate of an|archy; but does anarchy conduct to equality and liberty? No. It overthrows all e&s;ta|bli&s;hed order; and, in the place of here|ditary authority, &s;ub&s;titutes that of the po|pulace, which being directed by le&s;s rea&s;on|able principles, nece&s;&s;arily exerci&s;es an in|&s;upportable ryranny: Of which France is an example. The palaces and rich property of the nobility and clergy cannot be equally divided; and they become the prey of tho&s;e mi&s;creants that are the mo&s;t depraved and daring, and perhaps, one day we may &s;ee the Ex-capuchin Chabot, Lord of Chantilly; Bazire, Lord of Chambord, and Merlin,
<PB N="xx" REF="026918_0018_0FD25FE3762EED08">
Lord of Chanteloup; and filling the places of the great Conde, the Mare&s;chal de Saxe, and the Duke de Choi&s;euil. Perhaps we &s;hall &s;ee changes a thou&s;and times more ex|travagant and ridiculous. And what good will re&s;ult to the people by the&s;e hideous changes? They will &s;till have ma&s;ters. But of what a new and contemptible race!</P>
<P>This di&s;a&s;trous &s;tate of things is at pre&s;ent confined to France, but its democratic or rather mon&s;trous Republic cannot exi&s;t but by the &s;preading of anarchy among all its neighbours. Thus her intere&s;t, and every part of her policy, (which &s;he is not even de&s;irous of concealing) con&s;i&s;ts in preaching and propagating anarchy. As experience proves that it is ea&s;y to deceive and betray a people in preaching liberty to them, (&s;ince it is le&s;s difficult to create confu&s;ion than to re&s;tore order), and as the poor are more numerous in every country than the rich and the noble, it is to be feared that, tempted by the example and &s;upport of the licentious people of France, all nations will imitate her exce&s;&s;es, and turbulence and anarchy become univer&s;al.</P>
<P>This confu&s;ion accompanied with all its mi&s;eries is inevitable, if the foreign powers are unable to &s;top the progre&s;s of the French Revolution. The forces employed by the allies are &s;o great that &s;ucce&s;s is infallible if they be directed by wi&s;dom and prudence. But if the allies abu&s;e their power and rob the unfortunate family, who&s;e defenders they
<PB N="xxi" REF="026918_0019_0FD25FA730770F08">
avow them&s;elves to be, the exce&s;s of the French people will be ju&s;tified, and the &s;ame dangers and misfortunes will again de&s;olate Europe.</P>
<P>General Dumourier has di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this &s;ub|ject more fully in another work, which he has delivered to per&s;ons who have promi&s;ed to convey it to the Emperor, and he hopes for the &s;ake of mankind, that it will not be neglected or forgotten.</P>
<P>Although General Dumourier has a&s;&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ity of founding every &s;table go|vernment on an ari&s;tocracy, it is not to be under&s;tood that he would grant all right and privilege to the nobles and nothing to the people. Nobility was in its original the reward of virtue; and the titles, honours, and feudal rights attached to it, are the legi|timate property of their de&s;cendants, and nothing could be more unju&s;t than to deprive &s;uch of the nobility as have not brone arms again&s;t France of any part of their hereditary rights. But nobles &s;hould have no privileges in the eye of the law, either in engro&s;&s;ing of places, or in exemption from duties. In a free government, all are equal in this re&s;pect, and a nobleman is a &s;imple citizen. He has no ju&s;t claim to the acqui&s;ition of places but by his &s;ervices, his talents, and his virtues. He has the advantages of education, lei&s;ure, and the example of his ance&s;try. Of the&s;e it is his duty to avail him&s;elf; but the&s;e are his only ju&s;t advantages; and in this &s;y&s;tem is to be found the only true equality that has exi&s;ted in any age, or among any people.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="026918_0020_0FD25FE683B4F980">
It is not becau&s;e all the members of the Convention, and the generals of the armies of France have been rai&s;ed from among the vulgar that the decrees of the former, or the military conduct of the latter, excite the di&s;|dain and the indignation of Europe, but be|cau&s;e they are ab&s;urd, criminal, ignorant, and cruel.</P>
<P>Certainly a &s;tate may exi&s;t without a king, a court, or a nobility; but it is not true that a great and powerful nation can exi&s;t without nobility; for nobility being the reward of virtue, becomes a motive not ea&s;ily to be de&s;troyed in the de&s;cendants of the virtuous man.</P>
<P>This applies only to nobility, as it exi&s;ted in its origin, for that which is &s;old by kings is a wretched abu&s;e, the offspring of the ava|rice of kings, and will cea&s;e of it&s;elf as a ri|diculous vanity, when titles &s;hall no longer be attended with pecuniary privileges, which the public opinion has forever abo|li&s;hed in France, and which if an attempt be made to re&s;tore it by foreign powers will but &s;erve to produce another Revolution.</P>
<P>The ari&s;tocracy that General Dumourier regards as nece&s;&s;ary to all government is that of virtue and talent. To govern men, to fit in judgment upon crimes, or to decide on que&s;tions of property, to in&s;truct men in the duties of religion, to conduct the citi|zens of a great empire in war, are employ|ments that mu&s;t be &s;tudied as other employ|ments are. The declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Con&s;titution to which it
<PB N="xxiii" REF="026918_0021_0FD25FA8B1B82A28">
&s;erved as a ba&s;is, will in&s;truct the future king of the French, in what manner it is his duty to &s;elect tho&s;e who are to aid him in the government of the kingdom. The right of choo&s;ing &s;uch men is the noble&s;t at|tribute of royalty. Let us examine that &s;ub|lime Con&s;titution, and we will find that no condition can be found more happy for a wi&s;e and virtuous man than that of a king of France.</P>
<P>Frenchmen, li&s;ten to the temperate and informed part of Europe, again adopt with &s;incerity, that true code of philo&s;ophy, and your monarch will be re&s;pected and pow|erful, your nobility will again become wor|thy of their ance&s;tors, your clergy pious, worthy, and u&s;eful, and you will become the happie&s;t nation of the earth!</P>
<P>Such is the zealous wi&s;h of a man whom you would de&s;troy, becau&s;e he &s;aved your country, and has always &s;poken with &s;ince|rity; whom the emigrants load with calum|nies, becau&s;e in quitting his country he would not turn his arms again&s;t her like them&s;elves; whom the mini&s;ters of foreign courts declared to be a dangerous man be|cau&s;e he a&s;&s;erts that the &s;overeign power re|&s;ides in the people.

<HEAD>BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF GENERAL DUMOURIER. EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER WRITTEN TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;AT pre&s;ent, my dear friend, let us quit the&s;e ab&s;tract notions, too &s;ublime to be the ge|neral &s;ubject of a letter, and let us enquire what is the re&s;ult of &s;uch principles. It is that we ought to do all the good we can in our &s;tations: to be humane: but, above all, to be ju&s;t. It is never our duty to enquire what the opinions of men re&s;pecting us will be, and our actions ought never to be influenced by an attention to the que&s;tion of what may be thought of them. It is in times of great public commotion, during the revolutions of empires, that this principle ought to be maintained with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s. It is then that the ju&s;t man will call forth his talents to &s;ave his country, exert his genius to repre&s;ent the dangers of exce&s;s, and his courage to &s;tand between the nation and a great crime.</P>
<P>He will be hated and per&s;ecuted by all parties, &s;ince he will not flatter the pa&s;&s;ions of faction; but he con&s;oles him&s;elf in recollecting that he performs his duty. Per&s;ecutions appear but an incident that he was to expect; and he &s;upports them with fortitude, becau&s;e he knows they are the effect of mi&s;take that cannot be la&s;ting.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory re&s;tores the virtuous man to his ju&s;t rank among his fellow-citizens. My enemies cannot deny that I have acquired great military &s;ame; but, to ob&s;cure it, they paint me as a faith|le&s;s,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="026918_0024_0FD25FE9EFBCC788">
immoral, unprincipled man. They would drive me from the theatre of Europe to make room for meaner actors. I am willing to remain a &s;pectator of the &s;cene, but I cannot con&s;ent to de&s;cend from the &s;tage with opprobrium. The&s;e con&s;iderations have driven me to two deci&s;ive mea&s;ures. The fir&s;t, to publi&s;h the facts that ju&s;tify the latter period of my public life, which has been the mo&s;t calumniated. The &s;econd, to deliver my&s;elf up into the hands of the emperor, who, in&s;tigated and deceived by the gro&s;s Calum|nies of my per&s;ecutors, has given orders to have me arre&s;ted. Prudence perhaps would dictate a different conduct on my part, but duty re&s;ts on other calculations. The&s;e are mine: that this valuntary &s;urrender of my&s;elf into his power ought to convince the emperor of my innocence, and incline him to lay a&s;ide his prejudices. He is repre&s;ented as a ju&s;t man; I believe him to be &s;uch. He will value the confidence I place in his character, he will produce the accu&s;ations they have urged again&s;t me, and I &s;hall prove their fal&s;ehood. The&s;e memoirs will have appeared, in the interval, to ju&s;tify me to the world; and, having gained the confidence of a monarch even more than any other intere&s;ted in the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of peace and order, I may again render &s;ervices to humanity and my unhappy country. Should the emperor refu&s;e to hear my ju&s;tifica|tion, and con&s;ign me to the oblivion of a pri&s;on, I &s;hall only have to &s;uffer and to die. But this hi&s;tory of my life will vindicate my name. The con&s;equences of the treachery and inju&s;tice of my per&s;ecutors will fall on them&s;elves; and the em|peror him&s;elf will regret me.</P>
<P>In the approaching month, I &s;hall be fifty-five years of age. Shall I really &s;uffer le&s;s, if, by &s;hamefully concealing my&s;elf, I can e&s;cape a few days of reproach or impri&s;onment?</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="026918_0025_0FD25FB150D18AC0">
I will now give you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my life, which may &s;erve as a &s;upplement to my memoirs, if I am not allowed time to fini&s;h them. I was born at Cambray in 1739, of parents not affluent, although noble. My father was a man of great virtue and under&s;tanding; he be&s;towed on me a very careful and exten&s;ive education; at eighteen years of age I became a &s;oldier; and at two-and-twenty I was honoured with the cro&s;s of St. Louis, and had received twenty-two wounds.</P>
<P>On peace being made in 1763, I began my tra|vels, to &s;tudy the languages and manners of diffe|rent nations. The Emigrants have &s;aid, that at this time, I was employed as a &s;py by the French mini&s;try. It is not improbable that the <HI>petit|maitres</HI> of Tarentum and Athens (if there were any &s;uch men there) have &s;aid as much of Py|thagoras and Plato.</P>
<P>In 1768, I was put upon the &s;taff belonging to the army in Cor&s;ica; and, having &s;erved with reputation in the two campaigns of 1768 and 1769, I was rai&s;ed to the rank of Colonel.</P>
<P>In 1770, the Duke de Choi&s;euil appointed me mini&s;ter to the confederates of Poland; and I commanded a body of men in that country during two campaigns, and conducted &s;everal very im|portant negotiations with various &s;ucce&s;s. As the mea&s;ures of the confederates were ill concerted, their revolution was unfortunate, and ended in the partition of Poland.</P>
<P>In 1772, the Marquis of Monteynard, mini&s;ter of war, employed me in correcting and revi&s;ing the military code of laws; at the end of the &s;ame year, this mini&s;ter by the expre&s;s order of Louis the XV. entru&s;ted me with the management of a &s;ecret negotiation relative to the revolution in Sweden; but, having received my in&s;tructions on this affair immediately from the king him&s;elf, and unknown to the Duke D'Aiguillon, mini&s;ter
<PB N="xxviii" REF="026918_0026_0FD25FEB9C49AB30">
of foreign affairs; I was arre&s;ted at Hamburg in 1773, and conducted to the Ba&s;tile by the orders of that mini&s;ter. The irre&s;olute Louis XV. yielding to the importunities of Madame du Barry his mi&s;tre&s;s, and the Duke Aiguillon, di&s;graced the virtuous Monteynard, forebore to inform the Duke of the authority he had given me to nego|tiate, and &s;uffered me to bear the weight of a criminal pro&s;ecution, which the Duke D'Aiguillon &s;u&s;pecting the truth, feared to carry to all its ex|tremity. I rejected offers of friend&s;hip and pro|tection made me by this de&s;potic mini&s;ter whom I did not e&s;teem; and after lying &s;ix months in the Ba&s;tile, I was bani&s;hed to the Ca&s;tle of Caen for three months.</P>
<P>Louis XV. died &s;oon after; and D'Aiguillon was di&s;graced. I had no inclination to take advan|tage of the expiration of the <HI>Lettre de Cachet,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of regaining my liberty; I was anxi|ous to be completely ju&s;tified, and therefore peti|tioned Louis XVI. to remove me to the Ba&s;tile and to order a revi&s;ion of my trial. The king would not permit me to remain in pri&s;on, and com|manded M. du Muy, M. de Vergennes, and M. de Sartine to revi&s;e the trial, and tho&s;e three mini&s;ters &s;igned a declaration that I had been un|ju&s;tly pro&s;ecuted. Immediately after I was &s;ent to Li&s;le, in my rank of colonel, to make a report re&s;pecting the new military manoeuvres which the Baron de Pir&s;ch had brought from Pru&s;&s;ia. I had al&s;o a commi&s;&s;ion to examine a plan for improving the navigation of the river Lys, and another plan of forming a harbour in the channe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at Ambleteu&s;e. And the&s;e employments occu|pied the latter end of the year 1774, and the who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of 1775.</P>
<P>In 1776, I was joined in a commi&s;&s;ion with the Chevalier D'Oi&s;y, captain of a man of war, and Colonel la Roziere, one of the able&s;t engineers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="xxix" REF="026918_0027_0FD25FB32B472D88">
Europe, to determine on a proper place in the channel for the con&s;truction of a naval port. I pa&s;&s;ed the year 1777, in the country twenty leagues from Paris. It is the only period of re|po&s;e in my life. At the end of that year, I was invited to Paris, by M. de Montbarey, mini&s;ter of war, on account of the rupture between England and her colonies, which I had long predicted.</P>
<P>In 1778, I procured the office of commandant of Cherbourg to be revived and given to me. Being per&s;uaded that Cherbourg was better calcu|lated that any other place in the channel for a na|tional harbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and being aided by the zeal, acti|vity, and influence of the Duke d'Harcourt, governor of the province, I obtained a deci&s;ion, in favour of Cherbourg, of a que&s;tion that had been agitated during an hundred years, concerning the preference to be given to Cherbourg or La Hogue, for the &s;ite of a naval port. From that time till 1789, I was occupied in &s;uperintending the works of Cherbourg; and, during that period, I was but three times at Paris. When I fir&s;t arrived at Cherbourg, it contained no more than &s;even thou&s;and three hundred inhabitants, and when I quitted that place it contained nearly twenty thou|&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>The emigrants, not contented with &s;aying I was a &s;py from the mini&s;try while I was on my travels, have al&s;o reported that I was employed by the war office as one of the tools of its &s;ecret intrigues, although the time that I have pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, in the different journeys I made to that place during twelve years, did not altogether amount to &s;ix months, and although in the&s;e journeys I very rarely vi&s;ited Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>Let us review this hi&s;tory: twenty two wounds received in battle, &s;ix campaigns made in Germany, two in Cor&s;ica, and two in Poland, important tru&s;ts di&s;charged, a city rai&s;ed from ob&s;curity to a
<PB N="xxx" REF="026918_0028_0FD25FEE365DFBE8">
flouri&s;hing condition, a naval port e&s;tabli&s;hed, fortified, and rendered fit for the purpo&s;es of the navy, twenty years &s;pent in travels, that had a knowledge of mankind for their object, and in fine the &s;tudy of languages, of the military art, and of the policy of nations; &s;uch are the events of which it is compo&s;ed. It will be happy for France if &s;he produce many &s;uch de&s;igning and &s;elfi&s;h men. If tho&s;e who were called by their birth, their wealth, and their dignities to maintain the honour; and produce the happine&s;s of their country, had qualified them&s;elves with equal care, France would either have needed no revolution, or the revolu|tion would have been more happy and honourable.</P>
<P>For my part, the revolution was not nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e me to dignities. I &s;hould &s;oon have been lieutenant-general in the ordinary cour&s;e of pro|motion, and was on the point of receiving honours that men at that period &s;ought after. I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an income of 20,000 livres, which was equal to my wants and de&s;ires. Yet I could not but &s;ee that France was di&s;graced abroad, and ruined within. I fore&s;aw that &s;he ha&s;tened to this latter period of her mi&s;ery; and have often warned tho&s;e of the mini&s;ters, whom I e&s;teemed to be hone&s;t men, of the event.</P>
<P>When the revolution commenced, I deprived its character of much of its evil in the place where I commanded. At Cherbourg, the exce&s;&s;es of the populace were puni&s;hed by me with death; but the people could not accu&s;e me of being inimical to their liberty. Tho&s;e who were placed in like &s;ituations would have rendered an ine&s;timable &s;ervice to their country, in exerting the &s;ame firm|ne&s;s with the &s;ame di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>The military governments of towns in France being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, I went to Paris, where, during two years, I &s;tudied the influence and character of the revolution. The flight of the princes of Franco
<PB N="xxxi" REF="026918_0029_0FD25FB4B4D60428">
was an irreparable injury done to the cau&s;e of the king. I fore&s;aw that the exerci&s;e of the <HI>Veto</HI> would not produce the end that was propo&s;ed by it, and would occa&s;ion the ruin of the monarch's cau&s;e, and I oppo&s;ed it by all the means that were in my power.</P>
<P>In 1791, I was appointed to the command of the country from Nantes to Bourdeaux. At that period a religious war raged in La Vendee, and the peo|ple laid wa&s;te the ca&s;tles and lands of the nobility. I had the good fortune to calm the minds of the people, and to pre&s;erve tranquillity in that coun|try till the month of February, 1792, when I was recalled to Paris, was rai&s;ed to the rank of lieute|nant-general, and appointed mini&s;ter of foreign affairs.</P>
<P>I am reproached with having cau&s;ed the war by my coun&s;els; but I &s;hall prove that the war was already inevitable, when I began my admini&s;tra|tion, and that indeed it might be &s;aid to have com|menced. I acknowledge, however, that my opinion was decidedly for the declaration of war, as was al&s;o that of the king, who, not only approved of my memorial to the National A&s;&s;embly on that &s;ubject, (which was three days in his hands) but made corrections in it, and him&s;elf compo&s;ed the di&s;|cour&s;e he delivered to the a&s;&s;embly on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the end of three months, finding my&s;elf em|barra&s;&s;ed by the various factions, and being &s;incerely de&s;irous to &s;ee the king's council po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing proper dignity, and his mea&s;ures governed by con&s;titutional principles, I changed the mini&s;try, and obtained a promi&s;e that the king would &s;anction two decrees which appeared expedient to his &s;er|vice. Having done &s;o, I would have retired from the admini&s;tration. The king would not grant me his permi&s;&s;ion; the mini&s;try was again changed by his order and I took the war department. But,
<PB N="xxxii" REF="026918_0030_0FD25FEF4D38F6C8">
&s;oon perceiving that the court had deceived me, I re&s;olved not to be the in&s;trument of their intrigues. I predicted to the unhappy king and queen all the misfortunes in which they were involving them&s;elves, and I gave in my re&s;ignation three days after being appointed mini&s;ter of war.</P>
<P>I was not driven from the councils of the king as the emigrants have a&s;&s;erted, but re&s;igned in oppo&s;ition to the entreaties of Louis. He was two days before he would accept of my re&s;ignation, and he did not &s;uffer me to depart without ex|pre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t regret.</P>
<P>After that period, I commanded the armies with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. If the French had di&s;played as much moderation and virtue as they have en|joyed of &s;ucce&s;s, peace had been long &s;ince re&s;tored to Europe; Louis would have been on his throne; and the nation would not have been, as now, &s;tained with crimes, and the &s;lave of anarchy. France would have been happy and illu&s;trious under her con&s;titution and her king.</P>
<P>I have now, my worthy friend, given you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my life, and it will &s;tand in the place of one more circum&s;tantial, if opportunity be not given me to prepare a fuller account for the public. My heart is unburthened in &s;ending you this letter. Here, I wait the orders of the emperor, and the deci&s;ion of my fate, without inquietude. My mind, far from being weakened is fortified by di&s;a&s;ters; and I &s;hall be always my&s;elf.</P>

<P>IN the early periods of the Revolution we have &s;een the French combating for their indepen|dence with courage. But there was too much vio|lence in their mode of acquiring liberty to afford any hope that they would enjoy either that or their &s;ub&s;equent &s;ucce&s;&s;es with moderation. Having been hitherto victorious, they had no doubt that they were now invincible. They no longer thought of maintaining the good-will of a people who had received them with open arms.

their property and left them without any &s;pecies of liberty either moral or phy&s;ical.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on of character and political expe|rience had retired from the management of affairs, to e&s;cape the per&s;ecutions of an <HI>Ochlocracy</HI> that go|verned under the &s;anction of the dreadful &s;ociety of Jacobins. The King was in pri&s;on. The worthy of every de&s;cription were per&s;ecuted un|der the names of Feuillans, Moderes, and In|triguers. The con&s;titution was de&s;troyed. Paris was in the hands of the federates, invited there by the Girondine party, but who, on their ar|rival at Paris, had been gained by the Jacobins. The&s;e federates now threatened to bring to the &s;caffold Pethion, Bri&s;&s;ot, and all the leaders of the Girondine party. But their threats were loude&s;t again&s;t General Dumourier, whom Marat, Rober|&s;pierre, and the other heads of the Jacobins pointed Out as the in&s;trument and protector of that party, then di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>the politicians</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">The word in the original is <HI>Politiques.</HI> At Paris, the Giron|di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were called <HI>Les Politiques,</HI> or <HI>Les Hommes d'Etat.</HI> But the&s;e epithets were u&s;ed in di&s;dain, becau&s;e the politics of State&s;men were deemed to be unworthy of the &s;implicity of freeman.</NOTE>. This was a prejudice again&s;t the general altogether unfou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed; for he was unconnected with either party, having no more e&s;teem for one than the other, but regarding them as equally adver&s;e to the tranquillity of France, which he &s;aw no means of e&s;tabli&s;hing but by a revolution capable of de|&s;troying the influence of both. To this end his army was his only engine; and it will &s;oon be &s;een how little there was to be relied on.</P>
<P>France at the period of which we are now &s;peak|ing, a&s;&s;umed an appearance of pro&s;perity that de|ceived and elated the people; and more e&s;pecially, the predominant party. But &s;he had rendered her&s;elf odious to foreign nations; and was, in
<PB N="35" REF="026918_0033_0FD25FBC420B8B58">
truth, divided and weakened within her&s;elf. On the &s;ide of Italy, the French army was extended among the Alps by the acqui&s;ition of Savoy; and was further aggrandized by the addition of the county of Nice. The&s;e territories had incorpo|rated them&s;elves with the Republic, but violence alone was the author of the union.</P>
<P>Clubs compo&s;ed by a few corrupt men, who could exi&s;t only by a change in the government, were e&s;tabli&s;hed in every city by the Jacobin &s;ol|diers that were &s;cattered throughout the different armies. Their violent re&s;olutions at once acquired the validity of law. Que&s;tions were not even put to the vote. Every thing was carried by menaces and force. And patriotic addre&s;&s;es arrived at Paris from the foot of the Alps, from the mountains of the principality of Ba&s;le, from Mayence, Liege, and the cities of Belgium. The National Convention believed, or affected to believe, that the ble&s;&s;ings of our condition were a&s;certained by foreigners ranging them&s;elves under our colours.</P>
<P>Geneva became a club in&s;tead of a republic. Claviere gave a loo&s;e to old re&s;entments that he harboured again&s;t his country; and being appoint|ed mini&s;ter of finance by the Girondine party, he &s;acrificed General Monte&s;quieu, who, in di&s;charge of his duty as general of the army in the neigh|bourhood of Geneva, had attempted to &s;ave that city and Switzerland from the baneful influence of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>The principality of Porentruy, deceived by Go|bet bi&s;hop of Paris, and by his nephew Ringler, two de&s;picable adventurers, had al&s;o incorporated it&s;elf with France, and had adopted its dangerous reveries.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tine was ma&s;ter of Worms, Spire, and Mayence; but he had neglected to enter Coblentz, and had evacuated Franckfort, after having excited the dete&s;tation of the inhabitants again&s;t the ava|rice
<PB N="36" REF="026918_0034_0FD25FF229318070">
and turbulence of a people in who&s;e hands the torch of philo&s;ophy had lighted up the flames of di&s;cord.</P>
<P>Between Cu&s;tine's army and that commanded by Dumourier in the Netherlands, another had been placed under the orders of General Bournon|ville. But this army had been nearly annihilated in a di&s;graceful expedition undertaken by its gene|ral again&s;t Treves, after he had lo&s;t the opportu|nity of attacking that city with advantage. One third of his army being thus de&s;troyed, the re|mainder retired for the purpo&s;es of recruiting in|to cantonments in Lorraine. The Pru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the intervals left open by this retreat; and their po&s;ition, connected with Coblentz, Treves, and Luxembourg, entirely cut off the communication between Cu&s;tine and Du|mourier; &s;o that there was no longer any concert in the efforts of the two armies. And indeed Du|mourier's plans had already been deranged by the &s;tupid pride of Cu&s;tine, by the ignorance of the convention, and by the treachery of Pache, Meu|nier, and Ha&s;&s;enfratz, who having the direction of the war department and re&s;olving to ruin Dumou|rier, had di&s;organized the armies and with-held their means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The Netherlands were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the hands of the French army called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrny of Belgium, compo&s;ed of that of Dumourier and the army of the Ardennes commanded by General Va|lence. The latter was not more than 15,000 &s;trong. The two armies occupied Aix-la-Chapelle and the banks of the Meu&s;e. Clubs agitated all the cities of Belgium. The convention had &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners to execute the odious decree of the 15th of December, that &s;eque&s;tered the public property of Belgium; and &s;o had fru&s;trated the hopes of uniting tho&s;e rich provinces to the French republic although that union was the very object of this oppre&s;&s;ive decree. But the con|vention
<PB N="37" REF="026918_0035_0FD25FBDAFF0C038">
were eager to &s;eize on the wealth of Bel|gium previous to any union. Such was the plan of the financier Cambon; and he boa&s;ted of the project.</P>
<P>The immoral and ferocious di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ix commi&s;&s;ioners employed in this affair were well calculated to ruin the &s;cheme. Danton was a man of great energy of character; but was without edu|cation and equally dete&s;table in mind as he was coar&s;e and di&s;gu&s;tful in appearance. La Croix was an adventurer, a debauchee, and a braggart; and was de&s;titute of all &s;en&s;e and honour. Camus, the mo&s;t rugged, haughty, aukward, and pedantic of the Jan&s;eni&s;ts. Trielhard, little differing from Camus. Merlin of Douay, a well-meaning man; but &s;plenetic, and infected with extravagant and theoretic notions. And Go&s;&s;uin, a mon&s;ter of a brutal and &s;ordid &s;pirit <NOTE PLACE="foot">The&s;e portraits &s;eem to be drawn with too much &s;everity. If much may be &s;aid again&s;t the&s;e deputies, it is al&s;o well known that they have rendered many &s;ervices to their country. We &s;hould have been unwilling to have publi&s;hed the&s;e and other per&s;onalities that are to be found in General Dumourier's Me|moirs, if we had bad any right to &s;uppre&s;s them, and if we are not morever per&s;uaded that the important facts, exten&s;ive views, and u&s;eful objects of the work would amply compen&s;ate for &s;ome intemperate pa&s;&s;ages. Be&s;ides when we recollect the ingratitude and gro&s;s calumnies that have pur&s;ued General Du|mourier (who probably has di&s;covered more talent and conduct than any other per&s;on in the revolution, and who certainly as a general has gained the mo&s;t important victories and acquired the greate&s;t glory) we cannot wonder that in writing of his bittered enemies, he has indulged him&s;elf in writing &s;atire in&s;tead of hi&s;tory. <HI>Note by the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Editor.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners were joined thirty-two others named by the executive council, but re|commended by the club of Jacobins at Paris. The greater part of the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tants were mi&s;creants who came only to ma&s;&s;acre and pillage throughout the rich provinces of Belgium. They over-ran the unfortunate country; and while, by the terror of
<PB N="38" REF="026918_0036_0FD25FF859006BD0">
&s;abres and fu&s;ees, they drove the inhabitants to de|mand their being incorporated with the French republic, the&s;e men plundered the churches and palaces, emptied the coffers and &s;old the furniture of all who fell under their di&s;plea&s;ure, and whom they marked with the odious name of Ari&s;tocrats; and whom often con&s;i&s;ting of fathers of families and old men, and women and children, they &s;ent as ho&s;tages into the fortified towns of France.</P>
<P>The north and we&s;t of France began to unfold the &s;eeds of di&s;content again&s;t this bloody and horrible anarchy. The revolters of La Vendee were not however dangerous as yet; and there had been no difficulty in cru&s;hing them utterly, if any fore&s;ight had exi&s;ted in the National Conven|tion, or in the Councils of the executive power. But what is to be expected from a government in which while the wi&s;e he&s;itated, mad men &s;tep in and decide.</P>
<P>Two factions equally attrocious, the Mountain, and the Girondine party, divided the Convention.</P>
<P>The former, made up of the mo&s;t furious Jaco|bins, neither palliated their wicked principles nor their crimes. They &s;poke of nothing but blood and death. And, being without capacity to govern, having neither knowledge nor dige&s;ted plan, they would &s;uffer no dominion whatever. Not even the principal men of the faction could boa&s;t of ruling it; and the liberty of the faction con&s;i&s;ted in an|archy.</P>
<P>The other faction, compo&s;ed of metaphy&s;icians and intriguing &s;tate&s;men, had long abu&s;ed the &s;uperiority acquired hy their talents, and their more cultivated education. They had treated the Jacobins with di&s;dain. The executive council was their in&s;trument. And they imagined they &s;e|curely held the reins of government. But the Convention had been di&s;gu&s;ted by their in&s;olence and pride; and it was known, that this faction
<PB N="39" REF="026918_0037_0FD25FBF534405A8">
were the enemies of royalty only becau&s;e they a&s;|pired to fill its place. Hence the independent part of the a&s;&s;embly, tho&s;e men who execrated the atro|cities of the Jacobins, &s;tood yet more in fear of the ambition of Condorcet, Bri&s;&s;ot, Pethion, Gen&s;onne, Guadet, Vergniaux, &amp;c. And thus all other parties became united to humble the pre&s;umptu|ous Girondi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure of bringing the unhappy king to trial, re&s;ulted from the hatred of the two factions. It &s;erved them mutually for food; but the Giron|di&s;ts have too late di&s;covered how fatal it has been to them. Louis, the victim of their ambition and of their cowardice dragged them down in his fall, and left the field open to the triumph of the Ja|cobins.</P>
<P>The factions that &s;plit the a&s;&s;embly, divided the departments al&s;o; each e&s;pou&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions of their deputies. Bourdeaux, Mar&s;eilles, and Lyons, hated the Mountain; and were the fir&s;t to begin an oppo&s;ition, that has &s;ince degenerated into a civil war.</P>
<P>The Pyrennees and the inclemency of the &s;ea|&s;on, &s;till &s;ecured the frontier provinces of Spain; and that kingdom, at its lei&s;ure, collected the forces that were afterwards directed again Rou&s;&s;il|lon; while the Convention, occupied entirely by their own quarrels, and by the &s;tate of Paris, pro|vided none of the means of repelling the attack.</P>
<P>Paris, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable and mo&s;t guilty city that has exi&s;ted, thought her&s;elf the rival of Rome, becau&s;e in the &s;pace of a few months, &s;he had be|come the &s;cene of crimes, ma&s;&s;acres, and cata|&s;trophes, that were the accumulation of ages in the capital of the Roman empire. Forty theatres, always crowded, amu&s;ed her trifling, cowardly, and cruel inhabitants; while a &s;mall band of vil|lains, no le&s;s ridiculous in their preten&s;ions, than barbarous in their deeds, &s;upported by two or
<PB N="40" REF="026918_0038_0FD25FFA75047E98">
three thou&s;and dependants, the outca&s;ts of the provinces, and many of whom, indeed, were not Frenchmen, de&s;troyed the memory of the ma&s;&s;acres and horrors of each evening by tho&s;e of the &s;ucceeding morning. The frightful cavern of the Jacobins vomited forth every ill, and &s;pread terror through every hou&s;e. All men of property trembled, and citizens, who, in peaceful times would have been mild and virtuous, hardened their hearts again&s;t pity, and were ready to applaud guilt, le&s;t they &s;hould become its victims. All who had the remains of virtue or &s;hame were fled or were driven from the admini&s;tration of the department, of the municipality, and of the &s;ec|tions. An in&s;allible &s;ign always precedes the fall of nations. Then good men hide them&s;elves; and the wicked and violent alone remain in the conduct of affairs. And in this cri&s;is, it is not even in the power of &s;upernatural aid to &s;ave the people from the effects of public phrenzy.</P>
<P>Such was the terrible &s;ituation of France in the beginning of the year 1793. Such is the gulph to which democracy leads, when the populace takes the place of the nation, and tyrannizes over it by the Oligarchy of a few depraved wretches &s;elected from the refu&s;e of the people. At Rome a &s;enate, during many ages, controuled popular vehemence; and directed it, not towards happi|ne&s;s, but to the aggrandi&s;ement of the nation; for Rome turned her arms abroad, that &s;he might not de&s;troy her own offspring. France has no &s;uch counterpoi&s;e as that of the Senate of Rome; and the want of virtue in the governing party can bring nothing but di&s;grace and misfortune on her head.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the State of the Armies.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the political condition of France had even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more &s;olidity, and had been regulated by a prudent a&s;&s;embly, although France had gained the hearts of the nations to which her arms had opened her the way in&s;tead of having di&s;gu&s;ted them by a tyranny more of|fen&s;ive than that of a formal de&s;poti&s;m, it had been impo&s;&s;ible that this new Republic &s;hould &s;upport her&s;elf again&s;t the intere&s;ts of the whole of Europe, unle&s;s &s;he had e&s;tabli&s;hed a military &s;y&s;tem capable of making head again&s;t a univer&s;al attack upon her territory by &s;ea and land. The National Convention, never mi&s;tru&s;ting them&s;elves on any &s;ubject, becau&s;e they were ignorant of the political combinations of things, i&s;&s;ued a decree on the 19th of November, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">92, again&s;t every de&s;pot in the univer&s;e, and invited the people every where, to throw off their yoke; promi&s;ing them protection and fraternity on condition of their adopting the French Sy&s;tem. But they ought to have humbled the Empire, Pru&s;&s;ia, Spain, and Ru&s;&s;ia, before they made &s;o proud a declaration. A ju&s;t a&s;&s;embly, an a&s;&s;embly regarding the rights of man united in &s;ociety, (for man in &s;avage &s;tate has no rights, and a &s;tate of nature confounds all rights) would have perceived &s;uch a decree to have been unju&s;t. The maxim of <HI>compelling men to come in</HI> is not more philo&s;ophical in a &s;ocial view, than it is in theo|logy. The Jacobin preacher is not le&s;s unju&s;t, than the preacher of the church of Rome; and it is unbecoming of liberty to be propagated, like the alcoran, by the &s;word.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="026918_0040_0FD25FFC5F004780">
But in taking the violent &s;tep of the 19th of November, it will at lea&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Convention, de&s;iring to range all men on the &s;ide of liberty, had taken due precautions that the decree &s;hould be &s;omething more than a vain and dangerous boa&s;t, and con&s;equently that they had placed their military e&s;tabli&s;hment on the &s;tronge&s;t footing. General Dumourier, on becoming mini|&s;ter of the war department (which &s;ituation he held but three days, being appointed on the 13th and quitting it on the l6th of June, 1792) read a bold memorial to the National A&s;&s;embly, proving clearly, that they thought not of the army, and that far from placing it in a &s;tate to &s;upport the war, they were trifling with the public liberty and &s;afety. This memorial was forgotten. The cam|paign was begun. The General's &s;ucce&s;s which ought to have gained him the confidence of hi fellow-citizens, if no further yet as far as re&s;pected the military department, &s;erved merely to throw &s;u&s;picion on every advice he gave them. They not only altered his plan of the campaign, but they were de&s;irous of retarding his too rapid pro|gre&s;s. The Girondine party frankly told him, they &s;hould be extremely &s;orry to &s;ee him force the enemy too promptly to demand peace, &s;ince they feared the con&s;equence of the return of the army before they &s;hould have fini&s;hed the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Jacobins, who &s;uppo&s;ed the General to be connected with the Girondine party, accu&s;ed him of ambition. Their contemptible journals, e&s;pe|cially that of Marat, affected to make him at one time dictator, at another Duke of Brabant, and at another head of the Orleans faction, and under this la&s;t fiction, de&s;cribed him as intending to place the elde&s;t &s;on of the infamous and odious Philip, on the throne. Nothing could be more contradictory than the&s;e calumnies; for if Dumourier de&s;ired to be dictator, he &s;urely was not the ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of the hou&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="026918_0041_0FD25FC70B092A30">
of Orleans; if his aim was to be Duke of Brabant, he had then an intere&s;t foreign to the party in|trigues of his country. But the ab&s;urde&s;t accu&s;a|tions were &s;ufficient in France to tarni&s;h inno|cence. It has however &s;een that calumny was too feeble to &s;top the progre&s;s of a victorious general; and machinations of a more effective nature were employed, and which ended in the de&s;truction of the miliary re&s;ources.</P>
<P>Servan, having di&s;covered the difficulties of the war department, feigned &s;ickne&s;s; and while he declared the in&s;ufficiency of his &s;trength for the fatigues of his &s;ituation, he appointed him&s;elf ge|neral of the army of the Pyrennecs. Servan was lieutenant colonel in the preceding month of May. His health unequal to the duties of the cabinet, was robu&s;t enough to &s;upport the fatigues of the field. Yet the Revolution, it &s;eems, was under|taken to reform the improper di&s;tribution and abu&s;e of employments!</P>
<P>Roland, mini&s;ter of the interior department, was the mo&s;t intriguing and lea&s;t capable of the Girondine party. He had a friend, named Pache; a man of talents and great zeal, who had formerly been &s;ecretary to the Mare&s;chal de Ca&s;tries and had educated his &s;on. Roland imagined he could make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the war department, in procuring it for Pache. We &s;hall afterwards &s;ee how far the re&s;ult was favourable to the de&s;igns of Roland.</P>
<P>Pache now became mini&s;ter of war, cho&s;e the following men, or was obliged to appoint them, to fill the principal departments of his office; Meu&s;|nier, an academician and a man of &s;en&s;e, but of as depraved a mind as could be found in France; another academician, named Vandermonde; a Ja|cobin who had rendered him&s;elf ridiculous by the affected vulgarity of his manners, and dangerous by his intrigues, and who had a&s;&s;umed the name of
<PB N="44" REF="026918_0042_0FD25FFD6878EE70">
Ha&s;&s;enfratz to conceal the name of le Lievre, un|der which he would have been recognized to his di&s;grace; and Audouin who was Vicar of St. Eu|&s;tache and &s;on-in-law of Pache.</P>
<P>The&s;e new mini&s;ters threw every thing into confu&s;ion in the different departments of the war office, during the mo&s;t important and hazardous campaign. The few per&s;ons of experience that remained were di&s;charged and their &s;ituations filled, not merely by Jacobins, but by &s;uch of them as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the ma&s;&s;acres of the fir&s;t &s;ix days of September. The admini&s;tra|tions e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;upply of arms, cloathing, provi&s;ions, and for regulating the ho&s;pitals, were aboli&s;hed. The old and experienced commi&s;&s;aries and contractors were either di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, or calumni|ated, or dragged to the bar of ju&s;tice; or thrown into-pri&s;on, and rendered infamous without being heard. As the&s;e imprudent and unju&s;t mea&s;ures equally affected all the armies, although particu|larly aimed at that of Dumourier, the complaints of the generals were univer&s;al. Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Convention were &s;ent to examine into the truth of the complaints. Their reports were alarming. But the committee of military affairs, who in no ca&s;e could have any other effect than to embarra&s;s the mea&s;ures of the war department however wi&s;ely concerted, was now made the in|&s;trument of ju&s;tifying the fal&s;e &s;tatements of Pache in direct oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the generals and commi&s;&s;ioners. The Convention pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day; and Pache e&s;caped with having been &s;imply ordered to the bar, and with the reproaches which the generals continued to lay upon him.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners Camus, Go&s;&s;oin, Danton, and la Croix, were them&s;elves witne&s;&s;es in the month of December, of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition of the army in the camp of Liege; and rendered an
<PB N="45" REF="026918_0043_0FD25FC82C84F130">
account of it in their reports to the Convention. but without applying any effective remedy to the evil. The army was compo&s;ed of forty-eight bat|talions; the complete&s;t of which were from three hundred and fifty, to four hundred men, and many of them were not more than two hundred: the whole amounting to between fourteen and fif|teen thou&s;and foot. The cavalry were about three thou&s;and two hundred. Mo&s;t of the foldiers were without &s;hoes, and encamped in the mud, their feet being protected by nothing but hay twi&s;ted together. The re&s;t of their cloathing corre&s;ponded with this deplorable appearance. Clothes had been di&s;tributed to &s;ome, but tho&s;e, to the num|ber of fifteen hundred, de&s;erted and returned to their re&s;pective homes. The &s;ick filled the ho&s;|pitals, where they were in want of every thing. To &s;uch a &s;tate was the victorious army of Jemappe reduced after the conque&s;t of Belgia.</P>
<P>This army had been obliged to &s;top &s;hort on the banks of the Meu&s;e for want of provi&s;ions; and, if its di&s;tre&s;s had been known to general Clair|fait, he might have engaged it with great advan|tage, for the carriages of the artillery were almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed, and in the preceding month of December &s;ix thou&s;and artillery hor&s;es had died at Tongres and at Liege for want of forage. The foot had but ten thou&s;and fu&s;ees in a condition for &s;ervice. The cavalry were in want of boots, &s;ad|dles, cloaks, carbines, pi&s;tols and &s;abres. The army was without money; and often the &s;taff offi|cers rai&s;ed contributions among them&s;elves to make out the &s;oldiers &s;ub&s;i&s;tence-money for the day.</P>
<P>General Dumourier could have &s;upplied all the&s;e wants in Brabant, Liege, and Holland; and had even entered into the nece&s;&s;ary contracts and made reports re&s;pecting them; but every plan was rejected and all his arrangements de&s;troyed. The
<PB N="46" REF="026918_0044_0FD25FFF366F8C00">
commi&s;&s;ary Ron&s;in, had orders to condemn, embarra&s;s and retard every mea&s;ure. His ho&s;ti|lity was open; he paid no regard to the opinion of the general: for he was certain of the &s;upport of the military committee, of the financier Cam|bon, of Pache and his dependants, together with the &s;ecret protection of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, who appeared to blame the&s;e di&s;or|ders, but &s;uffered them to remain without a check, and in the account they rendered in the month of January execu&s;ed Ron&s;in although they acknow|ledged him to be unfit for his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Manufactures were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Paris for every thing wanted in the armies. Cloth was convey|ed from Liege to Paris to make clothing for the troops. Leather was bought at Liege, at Dinans, and all along the banks of the Meu&s;e, to make &s;hoes at Paris, which were &s;ent to the army at nine livres each pair, altho' at Liege &s;hoes co&s;t no more than four livres, or four livres ten &s;ous per pair. Cloaks that could be manufactured at Antwerp for nineteen or twenty-one livres each, co&s;t fifty livres each at Paris; and cloaks were &s;ent from Paris to the army. The corn of the Netherlands was &s;ent to Nantz, from Nantz to Paris, was ground in the mills of Mont Martre, near Paris, and &s;ent back to the Netherlands.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t evil that re&s;ulted from the&s;e di&s;|orders, was their influence on the conduct of the &s;oldiery. We have already taken a review of the character of the&s;e troops, and have &s;een how diffi|cult it was for General Dumourier to avail him&s;elf of their courage. It may even be &s;aid, that he had accompli&s;hed what &s;eemed to be impo&s;&s;ible; and that in beating the Pru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians, he had obtained a victory more tedious and difficult over his licentious &s;oldiers, having introduced di&s;|cipline and love of order into an army, one fourth

part of which was compo&s;ed of troops of the line, infected by the &s;pirit of the times, and the other three parts of volunteers, each having an opinion of his own, and each proud of his victories, and rendered &s;u&s;ceptible of more mi&s;chief than good, by his notions of equality.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the campaign of 1792, the battalions were in want of officers. The &s;uperior officers were ill cho&s;en, and were without influence. The &s;oldiers them&s;elves cho&s;e their captains, lieutenants, and &s;ubaltern officers, and hence the&s;e officers were &s;ubject to the caprice of men, who acknowledged no &s;uperior. A &s;ingle Jacobin was &s;ufficient to ruin a battalion by his licentious di&s;|cour&s;es; and it was only by culpable conde&s;cen|tions that an officer could pre&s;erve his rank, or obtain promotion.</P>
<P>The city of Liege was the tomb of Frenchmen. They died there of hunger and every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s. And this city, where the army knew nothing but wants, was more &s;atal to it than Ca|pua, with its enjoyments, had been to the Cartha|ginians.</P>
<P>The people of Liege had carried the Revolu|tionary &s;pirit to an exce&s;s, proportioned to the exce&s;s of their &s;ufferings when they were betrayed and &s;ubdued by the Pru&s;&s;ians. They had there|fore withdrawn their confidence from the leaders of the Revolution, who laboured to &s;ecure liberty on the foundations of wi&s;e principles. Fabry and Che&s;trel, who were very hone&s;t men, and wi&s;hed only for the welfare of their country, had entirely lo&s;t their influence. The populace of Outremeu&s;e, perhaps the mo&s;t dangerous in Europe after tho&s;e of London and Paris, had made them&s;elves ma&s;|ters, not of the government, for there was none, but of the public force. Tho&s;e unhappy men thought only of vengeance and puni&s;hment. They conducted the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">o the

hou&s;es of their particular enemies, whom they treated as Ari&s;tocrats; that is to &s;ay, they pillaged and murdered them. This cruel inte&s;tine war, in which each French &s;oldier took an active part either for or again&s;t his ho&s;t, de&s;troyed the little di&s;cipline and good conduct which had hitherto exi&s;ted in the French army in the mid&s;t of mi&s;ery, want, and complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es. But it was im|po&s;&s;ible to puni&s;h, for it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the guilty. The people of Liege ca&s;t the fault upon the French; and the French recriminated upon the people of Liege. The General would have e&s;tabli&s;hed the puni&s;hment of death for &s;uch crimes. It had even been demanded of him by his army in a moment of enthu&s;ia&s;m. But the Commi&s;&s;ioners, while they &s;eemed to approve of this &s;everity, &s;ecretly and effectually oppo&s;ed it. Since that time, we have &s;een that one of the cau&s;es of the execution of the unfortunate Cu&s;tine, was the having e&s;tabli&s;hed the puni&s;hment of death in his army.</P>
<P>Dumourier's army occupied can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onments from Aix-la-Chapelle to Liege, in which cities were all the officers who could not procure quarters with their battalions. So that the &s;oldiers were almo&s;t left without commanders. Want had carried marauding to its utmo&s;t pitch. The &s;oldiers rob|bed in bands from village to village; and the pea|&s;ants took their revenge in killing &s;uch as, at any time, they found &s;ingle.</P>
<P>General Dumourier, prevented by the&s;e circum|&s;tances from pu&s;hing on to Cologne, and forcing Clairfait to repa&s;s the Rhine, re&s;olved at lea&s;t to &s;ecure the Meu&s;e. He therefore ordered the army of the Ardennes, con&s;i&s;ting of 15000 men, and commanded by General Valence, to join him; and placed them on his right, in the countries of Stavelo, Malmedy, Spa, Verviers, and Huy. A body of 18000 men under the command of Gene|ral

d'Harville, occupied the Meu&s;e from Givet to Namur; having his out-po&s;ts at Ciney, Marche, and Rochefort. The army under General Miranda occupied the left from Tongres to Ruremonde. It con&s;i&s;ted of 18000 men. New battalions, lately arrived from France, formed the garri&s;on of the Netherlands. And this line along the Meu&s;e a|mounted to from 65,000 to 70,000 men; and would have been &s;ufficient to have &s;eized upon the coun|try between the Meu&s;e and the Rhine, and to have occupied the banks of that la&s;t river from Burick to Cologne, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, fir&s;t, to take Mae&s;tricht, which General Dumourier was not permitted to do, although he had propo&s;ed it in the beginning of December, and had it then in his power; &s;econdly, to place a garri&s;on in Juliers, which was al&s;o forbidden him becau&s;e it was deemed nece&s;&s;ary to keep terms with the Elector Palatine, left he &s;hould deliver the pa&s;&s;age of Man|heim to the Imperial army, by which means they would have cut off the army of Cu&s;tine from Al&s;ace; and, la&s;tly, if the army of Belgia had been provided with provi&s;ions, arms, cloathing and money, &s;o that it might have marched in the month of December, and have forced the Imperiali&s;ts to repa&s;s the Rhine.</P>
<P>General Dumourier was per&s;uaded of the im|po&s;&s;ibility of his pre&s;erving his po&s;ition on the Meu&s;e, while he &s;hould neither be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guelders, Venloo, Mae&s;tricht, nor Juliers, He wrote to the Convention and the Mini&s;ter of the War Department to that effect. The rea&s;ons of his opinion will be found in his corre&s;pondence with Pache, printed in January, 1793. It was to|ward the clo&s;e of the preceding November that his quarrel commenced, with that Mini&s;ter, with the Jacobins who &s;upported him, and with the Convention who had not di&s;cernment to fore&s;ee the effects of his criminal conduct. In December

began the trial of the unfortunate Monarch, whole mild character conducted him to the &s;caffold. From that in&s;tant, the general &s;ore&s;aw the crimes and misfortunes that have &s;ince &s;prung from the chaos in France. He attempted to &s;ound the di&s;|po&s;itions of his army re&s;pecting the King, but his Staff-officers whom he employed in the ta&s;k effect|ed nothing, and thenceforward the general was pro&s;cribed. Not one &s;oldier, not one officer would con&s;ider the ca&s;e of the king. Every one di&s;covered the &s;ame apathy; and this cold di&s;po|&s;ition in the army on that point, ha&s;tened the General's de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Paris.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">General Dumourier departs from Leige for Paris.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL Dumourier was thus a prey to va|rious chagrins in the palace of the Prince Bi&s;hop of Leige; and, if it can be a con&s;olation to that Prelate, he may read with plea&s;ure that after the mo&s;t &s;plendid victories, this general was more unfortunate than him&s;elf. He had been harra&s;&s;ed by the calumnies of the Jacobins from the mo|ment that he had &s;aved France by driving a for|midable foe out of her territory. The conque&s;t of Belgium had increa&s;ed the <HI>column of his ene|mies,</HI> to expre&s;s him&s;elf in the words he u&s;ed to the National Convention after the battle of Je|mappe. He almo&s;t reproached him&s;elf with having lo&s;t the opportunity of quitting the com|mand that was offered him on his return from Champagne, by the ingratitude of his fellow|citizens. He had cau&s;ed the war to be declared,
<PB N="51" REF="026918_0049_0FD2604D7158FAF8">
in his former &s;ituation as mini&s;ter of &s;oreign af|fairs; he had afterward conducted it with glory as a general; he had nothing wherewith to re|proach him&s;elf on the&s;e accounts; but he &s;aw the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the war mouldering away, and he could not but be penetrated with grief, &s;ince the important &s;hare he had taken in the public con|cerns during nine months, had identified his fate with that of his country.</P>
<P>All his letters and memorials were either re|jected or misinterpreted; and his coun&s;els &s;light|ed. Cambon declared, nothing could be more dangerous to a republic than a victorious general. It was laid down as an axiom in the tribune of the National Convention, that ingratitude was a nece&s;&s;ary virtue in Republicans. The Conven|tion with-held the recompences due to the he|roes of Champagne and Belgium, becau&s;e the General had demanded them. By a decree, they authorized the mini&s;ter of war to annul the nomi|nation of officers made by the Generals. The corps were left de&s;titute of officers. New and ignorant men came from France, to gather the fruits of the army's toils. The General com|plained of the&s;e things to the National Conven|tion; and declared, if they would not do him right re&s;pecting them, both as to the wants of his army and the other evils which were the cau&s;e of its de&s;truction and di&s;organization, he &s;hould be compelled to give in his re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>He demanded as an indi&s;pen&s;ible &s;tep, the re|vocation of the impolitic and unju&s;t decree of the 15th of December, that had driven the Belgians to de&s;pair. Notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the General, it had been re&s;olved in the Con|vention that the decree &s;hould take place on the fir&s;t of January. Cambon had obtained this de|ci&s;ion; the four Commi&s;&s;ioners Camus, Go&s;&s;uin, Danton, and La Croix, &s;upported him; and the
<PB N="52" REF="026918_0050_0FD260096A432B08">
two latter boa&s;ted that they had done &s;o, to a|venge them&s;elves for an in&s;ult they had received at Ath, where they had been refu&s;ed a lodging. The General's honour was concerned in pre|venting the execution of the tyrannical decree, becau&s;e when he entered the Netherlands on the third of November he had publi&s;hed, with the fanction of the National Convention, a procla|mation declaring to the Belgians, that the French entered their country as friends and brethren; that they came to give them entire liberty; and that the people &s;hould be left to chu&s;e their own con&s;titution and mode of government, without interference from the French. The decree not only de&s;troyed the force of this proclamation, but al&s;o robbed the unhappy Belgians of all remains of liberty. The Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;eque&s;tered the public property and that of the clergy; and this nation no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any public revenue, nor the authorities nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve even the form of government.</P>
<P>Cambon expected to find money for the ex|pences of the war, in this plunder of a country that was the friend of France, and that had not been conquered, but had voluntarily a&s;&s;ociated it&s;elf with the Republic. This criminal and fordid conduct produced no benefit to France; on the contrary, it deprived her of 40,000 men, that the Belgians were willing to furni&s;h, and fifty millions of livres that they would have poured into the French trea&s;ury, to contribute to the de|fence of their liberty; and was followed by the lo&s;s of tho&s;e fine Provinces, and excited a de|ta&s;tation of the National Convention and their Commi&s;&s;ioners, that will be eternal.</P>
<P>By an article of the decree the generals were charged with its execution, and were required to place the &s;eals on the public property. General Dumourier rejected this di&s;honourable employ|ment;
<PB N="53" REF="026918_0051_0FD2604E69B4F4C8">
and the commi&s;&s;ioners gave the charge to Ron&s;in, who employed as his in&s;truments, &s;ol|diers and clerks of office, all Jacobins, who &s;tole half the wealth they were ordered to &s;ecure in the name of the nation.</P>
<P>The general, being unable to prevent the&s;e ba&s;e actions, re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to mark his di&s;approba|tion of them as much as he could, to the Bel|gians, by being ab&s;ent, if that were po&s;&s;ible, while they &s;hould be tran&s;acting. On the&s;e, and all the other &s;ubjects of his vexation, he explain|ed his views &s;o clearly to the commi&s;&s;ioners, and General Valence &s;upported his rea&s;onings with &s;uch force, that in a conference held at Leige be|tween the commi&s;&s;ioners, the generals, and the admini&s;trators that were entru&s;ted with providing &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the army, it being clearly &s;hewn to the&s;e admini&s;trators that they could not furni&s;h him provi&s;ions even to remain at Leige, much le&s;s to march forward, it was decided that Camus, the Pre&s;ident of the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould return to Paris, attended by General Thouvenot, the fir&s;t to make a &s;uitable report to the National Conven|tion, and the &s;econd to lay before the military committee an account of the wants of the army, and to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements, and al&s;o &s;olid and ample contracts for e&s;tabli&s;hing maga|zines on the Meu&s;e, and more than all the re&s;t, to obtain a revocation of the decree of the 15th of December, which added the whole Belgic na|tion to the number of our enemies. General Thouvenot took with him al&s;o written ob&s;erva|tions of generals on the plan of the campaign, as laid down by the mini&s;ter of war, and was to bring back with him a deci&s;ion on that point.&mdash; The journey, however, was altogether un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, notwith&s;tanding the talents of General Thou|venot, becau&s;e Camus, opiniated, deceitful and vulgar, and not contented without engro&s;&s;|ing
<PB N="54" REF="026918_0052_0FD2600AF06D1070">
all the honour of the emba&s;&s;y, a&s;&s;umed the &s;ole right of &s;peaking, &s;upported the decree, and yielded to the will of others re&s;pecting the article of the committee of contracts. Thus, in&s;tead of removing the evils complained of, he only increa&s;ed the difficulty of the general's &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>Meanwhile General Dumourier &s;hut him&s;elf up in the palace of Liege, and was employed in &s;olliciting leave to return to Paris, and in re|flecting on his mi&s;ery. He continued to declare in his letters and memorials that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him any longer to hold the command if the Convention did not aboli&s;h the committee of contracts, which was no better than a den of knaves, and had cancelled his bargains of every kind with the Belgians; and if they did not change the mini&s;ter for the war department, who had nearly ruined the armies, and if they &s;hould continue to treat as conquered countries the pro|vinces that &s;hould be allied to France.</P>
<P>Such were the o&s;ten&s;ible motives on which the general demanded leave to go to Paris. He had another, however, much more e&s;&s;ential; but which he concealed with the utmo&s;t care. It was to endeavour to &s;ave the unfortunate Louis the XVIth, by repre&s;enting to the governing party the danger to which the nation was expo&s;ed with|out; and the nece&s;&s;ity of forming a &s;olid plan for the campaign, which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to commence at a very early period. He hoped the weight of this con&s;ideration, aided by other mo|tives, he meant to urge on the different &s;actions in the convention, would &s;ecure a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the abominable trial.</P>
<P>General Dumourier was in this embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation at Leige, and his mind agitated in the manner we have &s;een, at the very moment when the Jacobins were contriving, to bring him to
<PB N="55" REF="026918_0053_0FD2604FF79825B0">
trial; and when they pretended that he pa&s;&s;ed his time &s;urrounded by courtezans and actre&s;&s;es. The mini&s;try indeed had &s;ent him a detachment from the opera; but the&s;e returned to Paris after a &s;tay of no more than twenty-four hours. This expedition, and that of a troop of comedians from the theatre of Montan&s;ier, co&s;t the nation more than 100,000 livres, the government pre|tending to inculcate French revolutionary prin|ciples to the Belgians, by exhibiting democratic pieces in their theatres. The general di&s;dained to be the protector of &s;uch &s;ollies. All that he &s;aw of the&s;e deputies from the opera was at his table, having invited them to dinner. And certainty they conducted them&s;elves with much decency and good &s;en&s;e; and di&s;covered much more &s;agacity than the mini&s;ters that had &s;ent them.</P>
<P>The general found it extremely difficult to ob|tain his leave of ab&s;ence. Pache and the Ja|cobins feared his pre&s;ence at Paris. And hav|ing in vain urged the &s;tate of his health and his need of repo&s;e, he was at length compelled to engage the commi&s;&s;ioners to demand the leave of ab&s;ence directly in their own name, and to de|clare &s;olemnly his determination to re&s;ign in ca&s;e of refu&s;al.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the vices that infected the army, there remained a &s;entiment of ju&s;tice a|mong the &s;oldiers which &s;ecured their attach|ment to a general with whom they had always been victorious, and to whom they could no way attribute their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The com|mi&s;&s;ioners therefore declared in their letters that the army would certainly di&s;band them&s;elves &s;hould the general re&s;ign. The leave of ab&s;ence arrived; and the General prepared in&s;tantly to depart, although La Croix propo&s;ed to make a tour with him to Aix-la-Chapelle, in the hope
<PB N="56" REF="026918_0054_0FD2600C9EDB17F8">
of detaining him &s;till longer in that country. But Dumourier had &s;ecretly determined never more to re&s;ume the command; and was not willing by vi&s;iting the quarters, to make a tacit engagement with the &s;oldiers for his return.</P>
<P>He arrived at Bru&s;&s;els; the command of which he had given to General Moreton. This man, who died in good time at Douay, had played a very curious part at Paris in the Revolution. He was an Ari&s;tocrat, taking that word in its mo&s;t odious acceptation. He had been colonel of the regiment of La Fere, and he had been broken under the old government for the vile&s;t acts of military de&s;poti&s;m. Re&s;entment threw him into the hands of the Republican party; and his in|fluence in the councils of the Palais Royal had made him one of the chief actors in the Revolu|tion. Become &s;ecretary of the Jacobins he plotted to procure a revi&s;ion of his former &s;entence; but the &s;entence remained in its original &s;tate. He was afterwards appointed colonel in the army of the north, and as he was well acquainted with all the parts of the di&s;cipline of the infantry, and had con&s;iderable ability, General Dumou|rier appointed him chief of the &s;taff to the ar|my of the North. When Dumourier took upon him the command in Champagne, Moreton, who could not penetrate the veil that covered that affair, although perfectly brave, mi&s;conducted him&s;elf at the breaking up of the camp of Maulde; and was in danger of being ma&s;&s;acred by the peo|ple of Valenciennes. General Dumourier's re|turn to the army of the north, then become the army of Belgium, replaced Moreton at the head of his &s;taff. But as Thouvenot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities for the &s;ituation which Moreton wanted, Dumou|rier made the latter lieutenant-general by &s;eniority (for &s;ix months was &s;ufficient to advance men to the highe&s;t rank by &s;eniority in this revolutionary
<PB N="57" REF="026918_0055_0FD2605168B96A40">
army) and gave him the command at Bru&s;&s;els and in Brabant, in order to make General Thouvenot head of the &s;taff. Moreton then threw off all re|&s;traint toward General Dumourier, and entirely gained by the Jacobins, to whom he already owed many obligations, he oppo&s;ed the &s;entiments and judgment of his General in every po&s;&s;ible way. He adopted the decree of the 15th or December; and became hateful to the people of Brabant. General Dumourier found him &s;urrounded by the Jacobin populace. He had rai&s;ed a corps that a&s;&s;umed the name of the Sans Culottes. The&s;e came to make an harangue to the General; and u&s;ed the phra&s;es <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>citizen.</HI> Dumourier was offended with this gro&s;&s;ne&s;s; and plainly told them that being chiefly French &s;oldiers, they ought not to addre&s;s him in &s;uch familiar phra&s;es, be|cau&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ed an equality incon&s;i&s;tent with the di&s;cipline of an army; that they ought to call him <HI>General</HI> or <HI>Citizen-general,</HI> but never <HI>citizen,</HI> without &s;uch like addition. He ordered their &s;ta|tutes to be brought to him, and told them, that on his return from Paris, he would decide re&s;pecting them: for this mob demanded pay; and were really paid, though unknown to the General, with the con&s;ent of the commi&s;&s;ioners, as a recompen&s;e for their &s;ervices, or rather for the atrocious vex|ations they had committed.</P>
<P>General Dumourier had before this, &s;ent a pro|clamation from Liege, to engage the Belgians &s;peedily to hold their primary a&s;&s;emblies, and forthwith to chu&s;e a con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly; becau&s;e in the decree of the 15th of December it was &s;aid, that the &s;eque&s;tration of the public property &s;hould cea&s;e when the people of Belgia &s;hould have cho&s;en their repre&s;entatives. The commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aw clearly enough that the appointment of an a&s;&s;embly would re&s;tore the Belgians to their liberty, and would deprive the commi&s;&s;ioners of the admini|&s;tration
<PB N="58" REF="026918_0056_0FD2600F05636500">
of the public revenue, and e&s;pecially of the plundering of the churches. They therefore delayed the publi&s;hing of the General's proclama|tion; and afterwards its execution, and prevented the holding of the primary a&s;&s;emblies at Alo&s;t, the place Dumourier had appointed, with a view to counteract the influence of the populace of Bru&s;|&s;els. The General had been warned by the ex|ample of Louis the XVI. who might have avoided the influence of Paris, by a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates-|general at Tours, Orleans, Blois, of Bourges. But &s;eeing, now, that the only means of &s;natching Belgium from the tyranny of the French Conven|tion had failed, he continued his journey without delay to Paris.</P>

<P>GENERAL Dumourier arrived in Paris on the fir&s;t of January. Having reflected that, on his vi&s;it to that place after the expul&s;ion of the Pru&s;|&s;ians from Champagne, Marat and the other Ja|cobin journali&s;ts had reproached him with &s;hew|ing him&s;elf at the theatre, and with &s;eeking popu|larity, he re&s;olved to avoid all places of public re&s;ort, to live as privately as po&s;&s;ible, and to &s;ee only his particular friends, or &s;uch per&s;ons as might be u&s;eful to him in the objects of his jour|ney.</P>
<P>He was five days without leaving his apart|ments, during which he compo&s;ed four memo|rials: the fir&s;t on the nece&s;&s;ity of recalling the de|cree

of the 15th of December, which had been confirmed and even aggravated by two decrees pa&s;&s;ed on the 28th and 31&s;t of the &s;ame month; the &s;econd, re&s;pecting the ill effects of the com|mittee of contracts, and the nece&s;&s;ity of replacing on the old footing the &s;upplying of the army with provi&s;ions, forage, hor&s;es, clothing, &amp;c. by the appointment of intelligent contractors; and the third and fourth on military affairs and the plans of the en&s;uing campaign. He concluded each of the&s;e memorials by a new declaration of his re&s;olution to re&s;ign if the National Convention &s;hould neglect any of the&s;e objects. He accom|panied them by a letter to the Pre&s;ident, reque&s;t|ing him to engage the Convention to form a new committee for the purpo&s;e of treating with the Generals, both as to the wants of the armies and future military operations. On the 7th of Janu|ary, he &s;ent the memorials and his letter to the pre&s;ident, who&s;e name was Treilhard, who had for|merly been an advocate, and who &s;hortly after this was joined with Merlin of Douay, another advocate, to the four former commi&s;&s;ioners of Belgia. The pre&s;ident neglecting to communicate the papers to the Convention, General Dumourier wrote him another letter, very &s;hort and peremptory.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January, a &s;ummary account of the affair was given to the convention. The letter was read. The memorials were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed there, and &s;ent to a committee of twenty-one members recently e&s;tabli&s;hed under the name of the committee of general &s;afety. The mo&s;t po|pular members of the other committees had been &s;elected for this committee, They opened their &s;ittings on the 13th, and the General was invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t. The memorials were read. Ignorant and frivolous di&s;putes &s;ucceeded. All &s;poke to|gether. And, after &s;itting three hours, they broke up without making the lea&s;t progre&s;s. A further

memorial, more detailed on certain points, was demanded of the General. As to the plan of the campaign, the members unanimou&s;ly agreed ut|terly to decline the con&s;ideration of it, alleging that it belonged properly to the executive coun|cil. The General attended a &s;econd &s;itting of the committee, held on the evening of the 15th with a memorial containing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minute &s;tatement of the required information. There were not more than half of the members pre&s;ent. They dropped in one after another; and, running &s;lightly through the memorial, which was very long and intricate, no more was &s;aid of the matter.</P>
<P>General Valence arrived previous to this &s;ittings he was admitted, and read a memorial re&s;pecting the recruiting and new modelling of the army. He propo&s;ed that the infantry &s;hould be divided into brigades, by incorporating two battalions of the National guards with each battalion of the line. This project, adopted by the Convention in the mid&s;t of the en&s;uing campaign, completed the ruin of the French army, by rendering it a body of mere volunteers without re&s;traint or di&s;cipline. The attention of the committee, who&s;e tri&s;ting and inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition was equalled only by their ignorance and indifference to the public welfare, was caught by this novelty, although it ought never to have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed but in a time of peace, or at lea&s;t not till the conclu&s;ion of the campaign and the committee entirely threw a&s;ide the impor|tant objects cotained in the General's memoirs.</P>
<P>General Biron, having quitted the army of Al|&s;ace to take upon him the command of that in the country of Nice, a&s;&s;i&s;ted al&s;o at the third &s;itting; and read a very pre&s;&s;ing memorial re&s;pecting the new contractors and the committee of contracts. The mini&s;ter of war being ordered to attend, and not being able to an&s;wer the accu&s;ations of the three Generals, was very gro&s;&s;ly treated by the
<PB N="61" REF="026918_0059_0FD2605475E8E358">
committee, charmed with finding an opportunity of humbling a mini&s;ter. They had, however, a ju&s;t occa&s;ion in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, for the mi|ni&s;ter had no other defence to offer than the pre|&s;enting of &s;tatements taxed with being fal&s;e. And the whole affair was referred to the military com|mittee, the lea&s;t re&s;pectable of all the committees of the Convention.</P>
<P>General Dumourier afterwards attended a fourth &s;itting. There were but five members pre&s;ent. They di&s;cu&s;&s;ed nothing. And, when they &s;epa|rated, they told him they would &s;end for him when they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to con&s;ult him again. Immediately the General retired to a &s;mall country hou&s;e at Clichy, from whence he came every day to Paris in the pro&s;ecution of his great|e&s;t object, that of &s;aving the king. He was never again called to attend the committee of general &s;afety. All the important affairs of France were &s;u&s;pended during that moment for the purfuit of a mea&s;ure that involved the ruin of the nation. The Convention were occupied by nothing but the trial of the king; which was pro&s;ecuted with the greate&s;t bitterne&s;s and mo&s;t indecent ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|barity.</P>
<P>It was from the &s;ate of his memorials that Ge|neral Dumourier expected the &s;alvation or the ruin of his country. Had they been adopted, he de&s;igned to have pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the Con|vention, to have appeared in public, and openly to have canva&s;&s;ed for the unfortunate monarch. He might then have promi&s;ed him&s;elf an impor|tant influence. He would have been &s;urrounded by a number of officers and &s;oldiers of his army who were on leave of ab&s;ence at Paris. And, by adding other means to the&s;e, he would have commanded a party &s;ufficiently &s;trong to counter|act the Jacobins, and their &s;upport, the federates. This re&s;ource was lo&s;t; and, far from being abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

to &s;ave the king, General Dumourier, de&s;titute of power and influence, and con&s;idered as a man dangerous to the republic, becau&s;e he di&s;approved of the crimes that were committing, feared only to injure Louis XVI. to precipitate the horrible ca|ta&s;trophe, which thence&s;orward appeared inevita|ble, and which has co&s;t the General nothing but angui&s;h.</P>
<P>A contemptible man, a man without knowledge and capacity, General La Bourdonnaye, the per|&s;onal enemy of General Dumourier, in revenge for having lo&s;t the command of the army of the north in the preceding year, in con&s;equence of complaints made again&s;t him by General Dumou|rier, pnbli&s;hed throughout Paris that the General had no other object in coming there than to &s;ave <HI>the mo&s;t hone&s;t man in the kingdom.</HI> It was an ap|pellation that indeed General Dumourier had very ju&s;tly given to the king in a letter written in 1791; and which had been printed, with the other papers found in the iron che&s;t, that Roland had lately delivered up to the Convention.</P>
<P>The &s;ame report was &s;pread by the Jacobins, e&s;pecially by Marat and his too active faction. It was &s;aid that the General held con&s;ultations with Roland and the Girondi&s;ts every evening. And the&s;e la&s;t, offended that he was as unwilling to Vi&s;it them in private, as the Jacobins, &s;pread the ru|mour that he &s;ecretly &s;aw <HI>Philip Egalite</HI>; that man unworthy of bearing the name of Duke of Orleans.</P>
<P>Dumourier wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> each day to the council; and returned in the evening to Clichy. But he never dined with any of the Mini&s;ters, except Le Brun and Garat. He avowedly &s;hunned the hou&s;es of Monge, mini&s;ter of the marine; Roland, mini&s;ter of the home department; Claviere, mini&s;ter of the finances; and above all, that of Pache, mini&s;ter of the war department.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="026918_0061_0FD26059E883FA90">
The war-office was become the filthie&s;t place imaginable, where 400 clerks, and numbers of women, affected to carry &s;lovenline&s;s of dre&s;s and coar&s;ene&s;s of manners into a &s;y&s;tem: Nothing was forwarded in the office, and nothing but rapacity was to be &s;een on all hands. Several of the vil|lains employed in this department, having Ha&s;|&s;enhatz and Meu&s;nier at their head, worked day and night to collect fal&s;e depo&s;itions, and to forge papers, to &s;ub&s;tantiate the accu&s;ation that Ha&s;&s;en|fratz had made at the Jacobin &s;ociety again&s;t the General, charging him with having embezzled twelve hundred thou&s;and livres in his contracts in Belgium. They excited the hatred of the federates again&s;t the General; and often pa&s;&s;ing by groupes of the&s;e, he has heard them propo&s;e in a loud voice to place his head on the top of a pike. One day in particular, he thought him&s;elf happy in e&s;caping through a narrow pa&s;&s;age from a gang of tho&s;e federates in the &s;treet of Montmartre, being warned again&s;t them by a trade&s;man who knew him, he having formerly lived two years in the &s;ame &s;treet. In the general meetings of the &s;ec|tions and in the coffee-hou&s;es, men were paid to declaim again&s;t him; and it was more than once in contemplation to &s;eize upon his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The frightful Santerre, commander of the Na|tional guards of Paris, profe&s;&s;ed a great attachment to General Dumourier; and frequently pre&s;&s;ed him to dine with his brother-in-law. His de&s;ign was to entice him to dine with Marat. The Ge|neral always declined the invitation, but on the polite&s;t pretences; obliged, in order to e&s;cape a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination, to behave with &s;eeming re&s;pect to this execrable man.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance that happened at this time, ren|dered the &s;ituation of the General more critical, although he had no concern in it. Colonel We&s;|terman had caned Marat on the Pont-neuf, for

having in his journal accu&s;ed the Colonel of being the creature of General Dumourier, and the prin|cipal in&s;trument of his rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eries. Marat thir&s;ted to revenge him&s;elf on the General, whom he &s;up|po&s;ed to be the author of the in&s;ult. Dumourier every day received intimations of Marat's de&s;igns again&s;t him, both from particular friends and by anonymous letters. And the General, for the fir&s;t time in his life, adopted the precaution of carry|ing pi&s;tols in his pocket.</P>
<P>Du Bois de Crance, the mo&s;t cowardly and bar|barous of the Jacobins, being one day at table with the General, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to offend him, imagining that the General, would be terri|fied by his great bulk and the ferocity of his air. General Dumourier laid hold of him, and im|po&s;ed &s;ilence upon him very effectually. Du Bois de Crance, in revenge, repeated every day in the Convention that Dumourier de&s;pi&s;ed its members, painting it as an a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ting of four hun|dred fools headed by three hundred robbers. Thus a violent &s;torm gathered round the General; and his enemies waited only for his re&s;ignation to ar|re&s;t and try him. He had long before been pro|&s;cribed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Trial of the King.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the &s;ame temper that this horde of cannibals pu&s;hed on the trial of the King with the bittere&s;t fury and the mo&s;t horrible joy. The trial is in the hands of all tne nations of Europe. The proofs, documents, and pleadings are publi&s;hed, and will remain the di&s;honour of the French na|tion to all po&s;terity. Never was crime committed with &s;uch cowardice, &s;uch cold bloodedne&s;s, and &s;uch deliberation of mind. More than an hun|dred and fifty members of the pretended tribunal, had printed and publi&s;hed their opinion even be|fore they had been made acquainted with the facts and papers, on which it ought to have been found|ed. They ought therefore to have ab&s;tained from giving their vote, or their vote ought to have been rejected; but the unfortunate Louis XVI. had none of the privileges of an accu&s;ed man on his trial. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that the three hundred and ten members, who had the courage to vote for pre&s;erving the king's life in &s;pite of the dag|gers at their throats, had not re&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted that each of the judges who had given his opinion publicly in writing, &s;hould be incapacitated from voting. But tho&s;e friends of humanity will par|don this reflection in an hi&s;torian, who, far from de&s;igning to ca&s;t a reproach upon them, wi&s;hes to have the power of rai&s;ing a column to their names, as de&s;erving of remeinbrance, as were the names of the heroes at Marathon. In the unwor|thie&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="026918_0064_0FD26017AE4EFEE8">
a&s;&s;embly in the world, were found three hun|dred and ten men, who acted with con&s;cience and courage in the mid&s;t of general depravity and cow|ardice, and to whom the royal family of France has an eternal obligation. Ju&s;t and humane citi|zens, receive the homage of a &s;oldier, who ac|knowledges more courage in your conduct than he has &s;hewn, or than he has &s;een, in all his battles where he commanded with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s and glory!</P>
<P>This homage is pure and di&s;intere&s;ted. He who pays it expects nothing from kings, and is the friend of liberty; and, having &s;erved his country hone&s;tly has renounced her, whether &s;he again be brought under the terrible yoke of de&s;poti&s;m, or, by the ignorance and fal&s;e policy of the combined powers, &s;he &s;hall remain a re|public under the iron &s;y&s;tem of the Jacobins: For he no longer has any hope of &s;eeing France governed by a con&s;titutional king, &s;ubject to the law, and the &s;upport of the law. Your virtue &s;hall be more re&s;pected in after times, ina&s;much as it &s;hall appear in the &s;ame page with the con|duct of the Girondi&s;ts, who&s;e intrigues, as far at lea&s;t as they are known to General Dumourier, &s;hall be delivered over, one by one, to hi&s;tory who&s;e province it is to puni&s;h crimes.</P>
<P>It has often been demanded if it were the in|tention of the Girondine party to &s;ave the king. The que&s;tion is difficult to an&s;wer; and it does not &s;eem that we can di&s;cover the truth, but in di&s;tin|gui&s;hing two periods of very different characters in the exi&s;tence of this faction, and con&s;equently in its ambitious members, that varied with the change of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It is certain that this faction, after having long &s;wayed the Convention and the mini&s;try, elated by the exce&s;s of their influence, openly a&s;pired to the e&s;tabli&s;hing of a Republic, as the means of perpetuating their power. They had &s;ubdued the
<PB N="67" REF="026918_0065_0FD2605D900322E8">
feuillans, the moderate party, and the royali&s;ts. They had enli&s;ted mo&s;t of the daily journals on their &s;ide. The Paris Journal, the Chronicle, the Monitor, the Patriot, the Thermometer, the Journals of Gor&s;as and of Carra, in a word, all that were e&s;teemed, and in great circulation, were compo&s;ed, corrected, and edited by the members of this faction. The be&s;t orators of the Conven|tion, Gaudet, Vergneaux, La Source, Bri&s;&s;ot, Gen&s;onne, and Condorcet, gave reputation and currency to the opinions of the faction. They had &s;eized upon the direction of the principal committees. Sieyes and Condorcet were at the head of the committee of the con&s;titution. Bri&s;&s;ot and Gen&s;onne governed the diplomatic com|mittee a&s;&s;ociated with that of general &s;afety. The committee of finances was entirely at the devotion of Cambon, whom the Girondine party at that time believed to be their partizan. And they ruled Paris during all the mayoralty of Pethion.</P>
<P>This faction may be called the Je&s;uits of the Re|volution. They acted on the &s;ame political &s;y&s;tem; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t the &s;ame unlimited power; blinded, afterwards, in a like manner, by pride, they committed the &s;ame faults, and underwent the &s;ame fate. During their reign they contemned and in&s;ulted the royal family. Pethion, in the &s;ame carriage with the King and Queen, on their return from Varennes, took every occa&s;ion to de|clare that he no longer de&s;igned to &s;upport the monarchy. The unfortunate Queen related the fact to General Dumourier; and Pethion after|wards acknowledged it, on his naming it to him.</P>
<P>But in the month of November 1792, circum|&s;tances were entirely changed. The popularity of <HI>King Pethion,</HI> for &s;o he was called in Paris, had &s;unk under the a&s;cendancy of the Jaco|bins, and the Mar&s;eillois, whom the Jacobins had gained by patriotic orgies. A weak but hone&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="026918_0066_0FD26019462E4E50">
man, named Chambon, had &s;ucceeded Pethion in the mayoralty. He was de&s;pi&s;ed, and without power. The Jacobins tyrannized over the &s;ec|tions; and the commune of Paris a&s;&s;umed an au|thority independent of the Convention and fre|quently &s;uperior to it.</P>
<P>Barbaroux, deputy from Mar&s;eilles, one of the Girondine party, relying on his influence in that city, undertook to bring a new body of men from Mar&s;eilles; and, mean while, the party employed Roland, the mini&s;ter of the interior, to invite the deparments to find Federates to relieve Paris and the Convention from the tyranny of the former body of Mar&s;eillois. Nothing could be more im|prudent than this mea&s;ure. It could not fail to produce a civil war, unle&s;s the new Federates, &s;hould &s;trengthen them again&s;t their antagoni&s;ts: gained like the former by the Jacobins, which happened in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The intrigues of the Girondi&s;ts were unma&s;ked with great capacity, by Danton, La Croix, Rober|&s;pierre, and Marat. Impartial men in the Con|vention, &s;aw the dangerous ambition of the Gi|rondine faction. It was then that the party ought to have adopted a deci&s;ive conduct in defending the innocence of the king, and oppo&s;ing the &s;en|tence of death; and then, had they fallen, they would, at lea&s;t, have fallen with honour. But it it is mo&s;t probable that, on the contrary, their efforts would have been &s;ucce&s;sful, that the de|partments would have joined them to &s;ave the king and the country, and that the Jacobins would have been cru&s;hed. But the Girondine party po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the courage their &s;ituation demanded. They contented them&s;elves with propo&s;ing an inade|quate appeal to the people on the fate of Louis XVI. And this was con&s;idered as holding out another &s;ig|nal of civil war.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="026918_0067_0FD2605F35630DA0">
The Girondi&s;ts were terrified, and yielded to the torrent; but they did not &s;ave them&s;elves by their cowardice in voting with the Jacobins again&s;t the unfortunate monarch, who thus fell the victim of the united villainy of implacable mon&s;ters, and ignorant intriguers. Pethion had the ba&s;e cruelty, in a moment, while pity yet he&s;itated to condemn the king, to recall the remembrance of the vio|lence that was a&s;cribed to him on the unhappy days of the 9th and 10th of Augu&s;t. Having thus incen&s;ed his hearers by an unworthy charge, he concluded by voting for death. The veiled opi|nion of Condorcet, amounted to the &s;ame &s;entence. The conduct of this artful &s;choolman abounding in &s;ubtlety, and de&s;titute of feeling, has been equally atrocious in every &s;tage of the Revolution.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot, Gaudet, Gen&s;onne, and Vergniaux, were even eager to vote contrary to their known &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The accu&s;ation again&s;t Louis XVI. contained no article &s;ufficienty weighty to &s;anction the judg|ment. The cata&s;trophe of the 10th of Augu&s;t, was no crime to be imputed to the king. Carra had the impudence to publi&s;h in his journal, and declare in the Convention, that the event of that day had been prepared by a committee of five per|&s;ons, among whom were Pethion, Rober&s;pierre, and he, Carra; that the committee met in a &s;mall public hou&s;e in the Fauxbough St. Antoine; that the &s;cheme of obliging the king to arm and oppo&s;e the people, had failed twice, and had even been on the point of &s;ailing on the 10th of Augu&s;t. Hence it is clear, had this paper of Carra, been produced on the trial, it had ju&s;tified the king, by proving the nece&s;&s;ity of his taking up arms in his own defence. But neither ju&s;tice nor policy, nor good &s;en&s;e, were concerned in his trial.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="026918_0068_0FD2601E7A1673F0">
Providence &s;eems to have de&s;tined the arrival of this period, &s;o di&s;graceful to France, and &s;o deci&s;ive of her fate. All things con&s;pired again&s;t the unfortunate and innocent victim. Even the Emigrants, in the zeal of a mi&s;taken attachment, adopted mea&s;ures that were fatal to him. Ber|trand, ex-mini&s;ter of the marine, a re&s;ugee in England, imagined he could &s;ave the king by &s;end|ing to the Convention authentic papers, proving that the leaders of both parties had negociated with the king in &s;ecret. Danton and La Croix, e&s;pe|cially, were &s;o directly implicated in the papers, that their credit had been utterly ruined, if Dan|ton, ma&s;ter of the <HI>mountain,</HI> that is to &s;ay the Ja|cobin party, and La Croix, who influenced the <HI>Plain,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the independent part of the a&s;&s;embly, had not united their efforts to bury the memory of tho&s;e papers with the ill-fated king. The zeal of Bertrand, in&s;tead of &s;aving Louis, ha&s;tened his death. The murder was committed. On the guilty evening all the theatres were full. Unhappy Frenchmen!

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fruitle&s;s attempts of General Dumourier in behalf of the king.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the ab&s;urd and unju&s;t accu&s;ations of the Emigrants again&s;t General Dumourier, that which has obtained mo&s;t credit with ignorant and &s;uperficial men is, that he did not avail him|&s;elf of the a&s;cendancy which his victories gave him over his army, to lead it to Paris, and libe|rate the king. But it is to be con&s;idered, fir&s;t, that his influence with his army was always very precarious, and events afterwards proved that it was not to be relied on; &s;econdly, that this army was more than a hundred leagues from Pa|ris, was in want of every nece&s;&s;ary for a march, not being able even to quit the country of Leige, without great hazard of lo&s;ing its artillery for the want of hor&s;es; that this &s;tep would have aban|doned that country to the Au&s;trians, who al&s;o would have followed him; and that it would have been a degree of treachery to the honour and in|tere&s;ts of the French nation, which would have co&s;t the General and all his principal officers their heads before they could even have entered France; thirdly, that this army had for &s;ome time been in an ab&s;olute incapacity of proceeding even to the Rhine, which was only twenty leagues di&s;tant, and con&s;equently could not accompli&s;h the longer march to Paris.</P>
<P>General Dumourier, however, did entertain the project of conducting, not the whole of his army to Paris, but a cho&s;en detachment of troops of the line. But the example of Fayette, taught
<PB N="72" REF="026918_0070_0FD2601FEBB54CF0">
him to regard this mea&s;ure as a perilous extre|mity; and &s;ome legal form and pretence was wanting to give it colour, and to pre&s;erve to him the confidence of his &s;oldiers in the execution of it. He had declared, and written and repeated o&s;ten to the leaders of the Girondme party, and e&s;pecially to Barrere, who has &s;ince occa&s;ioned &s;uch mi&s;chief by his ver&s;atility, that, if the con|vention were overawed, they had to write but four lines in the form of a decree, and he would forthwith march 20,000 men to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Whether it were the effect of timidity, or a con|fidence in their own means and intrigues, the members that were &s;till con&s;idered as the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in the a&s;&s;embly were unwilling to em|ploy this re&s;ource. Indeed their views, &s;uch as they have &s;ince been di&s;covered to be, would na|turally prevent them from placing much confi|dence in the General, whom they knew to be perfectly attached to the con&s;titution and to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of order. Seeing no hope of &s;uch a decree as the General had pointed out, and governed by the motives that have been amply detailed in the foregoing chapters, he departed &s;ingly for Paris; but he had &s;ent before him, on leave of ab&s;ence, many of the officers command|ing corps, and other officers, and &s;oldiers, both of the line and national guards, and among them &s;ome Pari&s;ians, all of whom had promi&s;ed him their &s;ervices in behalf of the king. It is to be ob&s;erved al&s;o that at the time of his depar|ture, although the trial of Louis XVI. was be|gun, it could not be fore&s;een, e&s;pecially by one at the di&s;tance of an hundred leagues, that the i&s;&s;ue would have been &s;o &s;peedy and fatal. The General well knew that the criminal ferocity of the Jacobins would incite them to pre&s;s forward this hateful and bloody cata&s;trophe by every means within their reach: but he thought that

the Girondi&s;ts, not for hone&s;t rea&s;ons, but for political rea&s;ons and for their own &s;afety, would &s;pin out this affair, and &s;o give him time to take mea&s;ures for the re&s;cue of the king. It was not till his arrival at Paris that he knew the true &s;tate of things, and &s;aw how inadequate his re&s;ources were to the magnitude of the talk.</P>
<P>General Dumourier had been on terms of friend&s;hip with Gen&s;onne, a deputy of the de|partment of Gironde, and had found an oppor|tunity of pardoning &s;ome ho&s;tile mea&s;ures of that deputy toward him the preceding year, when Dumourier quitted the mini&s;try. He had di&s;|covered in Gen&s;onne great capacity and judg|ment and a humane di&s;po&s;ition; and he willingly renewed his connexions with him. General Du|mourier opened his mind to him relative to the king. He expre&s;&s;ed his horror at the crime that was about to &s;tain the nation; he made him &s;en|&s;ible that &s;uch a dete&s;table triumph given to the Jacobins would end in the ruin of all the hone&s;t part of the nation, and would render the an|archy that afflicted France incurable; that &s;uch of the nations of Europe as had regarded with indifference and perhaps with plea&s;ure our inte|rior &s;truggles, our war with Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia, and perhaps were not unwilling to &s;ee our &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e two powers, could not but be &s;hocked at the barbarity of murdering Louis XVI. and would be thenceforward engaged in honour to join the enemies of France, till we &s;hould have every power in Europe again&s;t us without one ally. The&s;e reflections &s;eemed to make great impre&s;&s;ion on Gen&s;onne; but to whatever cau&s;e it was owing, he undertook no|thing, and even avoided the General, who had afterward little opportunity of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>Dumourier conver&s;ed with &s;everal other de|puties of the &s;ame party, as well as with many

of the independent party in the Convention, to whom he repre&s;ented that, the nation being now a republic, Louis was to be tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed &s;imply as an individual; that it was indecent impolitic, and unrea&s;onable to wa&s;te time, that ought to be em|ployed in preparations again&s;t the dangers of the en&s;uing campaign and in reinforcing the armies, in the pro&s;ecution of the trial of a &s;ingle man, who&s;e fate was of no importance to the nation; and that it would be wi&s;e at lea&s;t to &s;u&s;pend this u&s;ele&s;s mea&s;ure till after the war. The more rea&s;onable of them acknowledged the trial to be an unju&s;t and unwi&s;e proceeding, but &s;aid, that the members of the <HI>Mountain</HI> had taken their mea&s;ures, and, &s;hould the trial now be abandoned by the Convention, the Jacobins would excite an in&s;urrection, fall upon the temple, and ma&s;&s;acre the whole of the pri&s;oners. The General then told them that he could not think they were &s;uffi|ciently authorized by their con&s;tituents to try the king; that, &s;ince they made an affair of con&s;equence of the trial, it appeared to him it would be nece&s;&s;ary to their own &s;ecurity to de|mand in&s;tructions in preci&s;e terms on the point from the departments, lea&s;t one day they &s;hould be reproached for the deed by the nation, and lea&s;t they &s;hould one day become per&s;onally re&s;|pon&s;ible for the irregularity and violence of the act. They an&s;wered to this, that the imprudent propo&s;al of appealing to the people made by the Girondine party had deprived them of the re|&s;ource the General now propo&s;ed; &s;ince it was feared the convoking of the primary a&s;&s;emblies for &s;uch in&s;tructions would be the &s;ignal of a ci|vil war.</P>
<P>It then occurred to the General to &s;ugge&s;t an idea that &s;eemed to have great weight with the&s;e deputies, although in the end it failed of effect like all the re&s;t, becau&s;e every man &s;eeing a
<PB N="75" REF="026918_0073_0FD26068B3C43280">
poignard at his brea&s;t, cho&s;e rather to be a mur|derer than a victim. The idea was, that a long war had exi&s;ted between the nation and the king, that the day of the 10th of Augu&s;t had decided the fate of both, that the king had fallen into their hands, and could no longer be con&s;idered as any thing but a pri&s;oner of war, yet without criminality, becau&s;e both parties had in like manner had recour&s;e to arms; that a foreign war raged again&s;t the nation, and that they ought to deem them&s;elves fortunate in having a precious ho&s;tage in this pri&s;oner, who might &s;erve them in a ca&s;e of extremity. The General added, that &s;hould they per&s;i&s;t in thinking the king guilty, they ought to form a tribunal authorized to col|lect facts, to examine and confront the witne&s;&s;es, and to prepare the way for a final deci&s;ion, with a deliberation due to the &s;ubject; that this act of ju&s;tice would &s;atisfy the bittere&s;t enemies of roy|alty, would give the people time to reflect, and to the Convention an opportunity to fini&s;h the con|&s;titution, which was the grand object of their mi&s;&s;ion; and when the primary a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould be convoked for the acceptance of the con&s;titu|tion, all the proceedings of the tribunal might be laid before them, and they be called upon to decide the fate of the king.</P>
<P>Having &s;pread this opinion in conver&s;ation and even in writing, the General &s;aw Pethion, with whom till this period he had been on terms of friend&s;hip, and repre&s;ented to him that it be|came him per&s;onally to intere&s;t him&s;elf in behalf of Louis XVI. &s;ince otherwi&s;e, a malignity of mind would be imputed to him that certainly was not in his character. Pethion appeared to be moved by the General's rea&s;oning; and declared that per&s;onally he <HI>loved</HI> the king, and that he would exert his utmo&s;t influence to &s;ave him.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="026918_0074_0FD26027F39C0940">
General Dumourier then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Rober&s;pierre, by the medium of one of his friends. He repre&s;ented that it was entirely in Rober&s;pierre's power to &s;ave Louis XVI. that the magnanimity of the action would immortalize his name, and that in con&s;equence of it the generals of the army would look up to him as the fir&s;t man in the &s;tate, and that the dictator&s;hip would be the reward of his virtue; but that otherwi&s;e he would fall into the &s;ame contempt and execration as Marat, with who&s;e name that of Rober&s;pierre would thenceforth be con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ociated. This idea the General knew to be peculiarly odious to Rober&s;pierre.</P>
<P>General Dumourier knew that the Jacobins de&s;pi&s;ed the Convention and hated the Giron|dine party. He in&s;inuated to them by &s;ecret agents, that if they wi&s;hed to become ma&s;ters of France and Europe, and to ri&s;e on the ruins of the National Convention, they had only to de|clare their will that the trial of Louis &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, and that a more important object, the &s;tate of the war, &s;hould be taken into con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>Drouet, po&s;t-ma&s;ter of St. Menehould, who had arre&s;ted the king at Varennes, was a deputy of the Convention and a Jacobin. The brother of Drouet, a very hone&s;t and faithful man, was in the General's &s;ervice, and was greatly attached to him. Dumourier gave this man in&s;tructions to prepare his brother's mind for the impre&s;&s;ions he wi&s;hed it to receive, and afterwards to bring him to Clichy. The General painted to Drouet the crime he and his a&s;&s;ociates were committing again&s;t the king, with &s;uch energy, that Drouet, &s;truck with horror, promi&s;ed to move for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the trial both in the Convention and in the club of the Jacobins. Had there been

one member &s;ufficiently re&s;olute to make the pro|po&s;ition, the king had been &s;aved. No one had the courage. Drouet fell &s;ick and was not pre|&s;ent when the &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Each day the General vi&s;ited various parts of Paris, went into the &s;hops and hou&s;es of indivi|duals, and took occa&s;ion always to turn the conver&s;ation to the king's trial. He ob&s;erved how &s;trange a circum&s;tance it &s;eemed that the Convention &s;hould &s;uddenly become a tribunal; that if Louis were &s;till king, the nation ought to decide by whom and with what forms he &s;hould be judged; that if he were no longer king, it was unfit that time &s;o precious to the nation, &s;hould be lo&s;t in enquiring into the guilt of an individual. And to the&s;e con&s;iderations he added reflections on the mild virtues and misfortunes of Louis XVI. Sometimes he was li&s;tened to with eagerne&s;s and pity; but frequently, he was re|que&s;ted to forbear &s;peaking of &s;o <HI>dangerous</HI> a to|pic; and &s;ometimes condemned for introducing it. At times, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;erious dan|ger, by expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize, that in a great city like Paris, there &s;hould not be five or &s;ix thou&s;and men with courage &s;ufficient to ri&s;e a|gain&s;t two or three thou&s;and villains, who calling them&s;elves Federates, held the city in ab&s;olute &s;ubjection. A well informed trade&s;man, ca&s;ting down his eyes and blu&s;hing with &s;hame, made this an&s;wer one day to the general: <HI>Citizen, I &s;ee what you would have us to do. But we are cow|ards and the king will be &s;acrificed. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you hope from a city that, having 80,000 armea men, &s;uffered it&s;elf to be intimidated on the fir&s;t days of September, by le&s;s than 6000 Mar&s;ellois and Bre|tons?</HI> The general left the man's hou&s;e, and re|tired to an unfrequented part of a public walk, to indulge in his melancholy reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="026918_0076_0FD26029CFBAEE88">
Tho&s;e &s;oldiers of his army that he met with from time to time, &s;eemed to be devoted to re|velling, and to be wholly in&s;ected with the phrenzy of the Federates; and &s;ome even join|ed the party of his enemies, filling the different clubs and meetings of the &s;ections with ab&s;urd accu&s;ations again&s;t him.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e attempts to &s;erve the king, which the general renewed every day in various forms and di&s;gui&s;es, and with much ri&s;k to his own per&s;on, he reaped nothing but the dreadful certainty of the king's ruin. Paris &s;eemed in|different on the &s;ubject.

<P>ALTHOUGH General Dumourier's con&s;titu|tion was robu&s;t, his health yielded for a while to the acute vexations of his mind. On the 18th of January, he fell &s;ick and was confined at his hou&s;e at Clichy, till the 22d. He now re&s;olved to quit Paris in a few days; and never to enter it more till he &s;hould come to di&s;per&s;e that un|worthy

a&s;&s;embly, who were ba&s;e and wicked enough, wantonly, precipitately, and without proof, to condemn to death an innocent king, who had ever loved his people, who&s;e faults were not his own, who had bani&s;hed the torture from criminal trials, who readily adopted every pro|po&s;al for the public benefit, and had him&s;elf in|vited the nation to remedy all abu&s;es and to pro|vide for its happine&s;s. Kings are &s;ubject in com|mon to many of the cau&s;es by which Louis XVI. was reduced to this unhappy condition; they are be&s;ieged and betrayed; they are kept in ignorance and &s;ee nothing as it really exi&s;ts; nor have they power to quit the circle in which they are placed, in &s;earch of the virtuous man who&s;e pure dignity &s;huns the corruption and in&s;olence of courts.&mdash; But it mu&s;t have been the complete&s;t di&s;order that could hurry a whole nation to the murder of their king, after having often ble&s;&s;ed and adored him; and having compared him to Louis XII. Henry IV. and all the be&s;t and mo&s;t beloved of their monarchs. The club of Jacobins con|ducted the French to this pitch of folly and wick|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t January, the day of the death of Louis XVI. is the true epoch of the ruin of the Republic, of the re&s;toration of the monarchy, and it may be feared of the triumph of de&s;poti&s;m. The French nation began the career of liberty gloriou&s;ly. Their fir&s;t exce&s;&s;es were pardonable, as they re&s;ulted from the ob&s;tinacy of the abu&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy. A noble con&s;titution, although in &s;ome degree it was imperfect, &s;eemed to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of France. General Du|mourier's journeys into England, Germany, Swit|zerland, and Italy, at that period, convinced him of the general approbation it obtained. But the king, &s;educed by his perfidious coun&s;ellors, at|tempted to e&s;cape from his people, after having
<PB N="80" REF="026918_0078_0FD2602B2B51D800">
&s;worn to maintain the con&s;titution. He was di&s;|covered and taken. The National A&s;&s;embly of France acted as became a great nation. They re|&s;tored the king to his rights; and from that in&s;tant the king cea&s;ed to be dangerous to the liberties of the people. He was governed faithfully by the principles of the con&s;titution. They were engraven on his heart. And if his mini&s;ters or his courtiers &s;till &s;ought to violate the law, the con&s;titution had provided a remedy for the evil. The agents of the executive power were re&s;pon|&s;ible with their lives for mi&s;conduct in the govern|ment, but an ab&s;olute inviolability was attached to the per&s;on of the king. The third legi&s;lature of France however, tended vi&s;ibly to Republic|ani&s;m; they were bent on the overthrow of the con&s;titution. It was nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e new accu|&s;ations again&s;t the king for his de&s;truction; and to this object the Girondine faction proceeded with the mo&s;t refined perfidy, while the Jacobins openly acted in the &s;ame cau&s;e with a wild and brutal in&s;olence. Carra and the journali&s;ts of the Jacobins have placed this &s;ubject in the cleare&s;t light, in tracing the intrigues which engendered the cata&s;trophe of the 10th of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The affair of the 21&s;t of June, was a prelude to that cata&s;trophe, although directly it produced nothing more than a di&s;gu&s;ting in&s;ult to the nation and the con&s;titution, in the unfortunate per&s;on of the king. The ferocious Santerre was heard to &s;ay on that day, <HI>We have failed now, but we will return again.</HI> The National Convention neither puni&s;hed nor re&s;ented the in&s;ult. On the con|trary, the two factions, which notwith&s;tanding their mutual hatred had many wicked objects in common, were preparing for the execution of a greater plot; and had a&s;&s;embled the Mar&s;ellois and Bretons from the extremities of the kingdom, to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="026918_0079_0FD260722B9DD520">
The&s;e were the true cau&s;es of the bloody and deci&s;ive 10th of Augu&s;t. The mini&s;ters and ge|nerals, it is true, took mea&s;ures, on their part, again&s;t the a&s;&s;embly, and the Jacobins; &s;uppo&s;ing however, that they were culpable, the law was armed again&s;t them, but ought to have had no ope|ration on the king, who was both innocent and inviolable, and who was to be con&s;idered merely as the occa&s;ion and not as the author of the &s;teps taken in his name. The nation was convinced of this truth; and if Louis had been firm he had not fallen. His a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ba&s;ely puni&s;hed the mildne&s;s of his character with death; and the mildne&s;s of his character &s;hould have pleaded for mercy.</P>
<P>But this good and weak monarch found in his religious principles, a &s;trength that bore him he|roically through his martyrdom. The particulars of his death are pre&s;erved, and are ine&s;timable aids in the &s;tudy of the human heart. They add new aggravations to the crimes of the Pari&s;ians. An innumerable crowd attended the execution. Barbarous joy, or an unfeeling curio&s;ity, were the only impre&s;&s;ions that appeared in the guilty &s;pec|tators. No one had the courage to &s;hed a tear; and it will &s;carcely be believed, that the dome&s;|tics of the good king pre&s;&s;ed neare&s;t to the &s;caffold, and were the mo&s;t implacable of the multi|tude.</P>
<P>On arriving at Paris, on the 22d, General Du|mourier went to the hou&s;e of Garat, mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, who &s;eemed to be extremely affected by the death of the king, but more e&s;pecially by the duty that had been impo&s;ed on him, and the other mini&s;ters, of reading the &s;entence to the king. The unfortunate Louis during the &s;olemn office, remained &s;tanding, and a&s;&s;umed a tranquil and ma|je&s;tic countenance, without offering remon&s;trance or complaint. He &s;aid only, that it was not ju&s;t to charge him with trea&s;on, &s;ince his intentions
<PB N="82" REF="026918_0080_0FD2602CBB426CE8">
had always been pure, and &s;ince he had con&s;tantly de&s;ired the welfare of his fellow-citizens. After reque&s;ting a little time to prepare for his death, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the mini&s;ters with an air of dignity and gentlene&s;s, the remembrance of which affected Garat very much in &s;peaking of it. General Du|mourier, Cabanis the friend and phy&s;ician of Mi|rabeau, and the mini&s;ter, were mutually affected. They read over the will of this unfortunate prince. It had been written with his own hand, in &s;ome places there were era&s;ures, but the writing was clear, and without any marks of being written with agitation. It contained four pages written on letter paper. The fir&s;t was con&s;ecrated to reli|gion, and the homage was ju&s;t; &s;ince, in that prin|ciple, he found courage, &s;upport and con&s;olation. The three other pages exhibited an example of magnanimity, rea&s;on, and philo&s;ophy. This will, &s;ince publi&s;hed to the world, is one of the noble&s;t writings that the mind ever produced under &s;uffer|ing circum&s;tances. The mon&s;ters of the National Convention have &s;aid, that this writing ju&s;tified the king's &s;entence; becau&s;e, having no object in common with the world, on the point of be|coming the victim of the ingratitude of his &s;ub|jects, he had employed in two or three places the language of royalty, and di&s;dained to flatter their prejudices.</P>
<P>During the exi&s;tence of a monarchy of fourteen hundred years the French have a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated many of their kings. But the deed was always the crime of an individual; the rage of the nation again&s;t, the perpetrator was extreme; and the villain was puni&s;hed with the mo&s;t horrible tortures. It was re&s;erved to an enlightened and philo&s;ophical age to produce a like crime, committed in the name of the whole French nation, approved by the majo|rity, and regarded as an act of Heroi&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="026918_0081_0FD22EE393108228">
Is the continuance and pro&s;perity of a republic, founded on &s;uch guilt, &s;oberly to be expected?&mdash; certainly not. The mon&s;ters have killed Louis XVI. but they have re&s;tored royalty. This incon|&s;iderate and changeable nation, always running to the extremes of pa&s;&s;ion, will her&s;elf ma&s;&s;acre her iniquitous judges and her furious Jacobins, and run to adore new kings. The efforts for a rea&s;onable liberty that have been made during three years by true Patriots will be lo&s;t; and France will pre&s;ent the picture of a monarchy crowded with di&s;graces and crimes, di&s;membered and ruined, in which a rigid de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t long combat a de&s;tructive anarchy before the reign of the laws can be re|&s;tored: and then it &s;hall not be the laws of the people. The whole of this generation, even tho&s;e that are but newly born, &s;hall endure the puni&s;h|ment of the atrocious crimes of four years: crimes that po&s;terity will &s;carcely be per&s;uaded to credit.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">General Dumourier's Conference with Cambon.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING particularly traced the tran&s;actions that mo&s;t affected General Dumourier in a cata|&s;trophe that he could neither prevent nor fore|&s;ee, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the account of his other occupations in Paris during this unhappy month of January. An e&s;&s;ential object of his journey was to obtain the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the decree of the 15th of December, or at lea&s;t a tacit agree|ment from the Convention, that it &s;hould not be put in execution in Brabant. He demon&s;trated to
<PB N="84" REF="026918_0082_0FD2603393571490">
the Convention that the people of Brabant were wholly alienated from the French; than an open rebellion was to be feared if the decree &s;hould be executed; that on the appearance of the Au&s;trians in force the French would have an additional ene|my in the Belgians, who might ea&s;ily attack their weakened garri&s;ons, cut off their provi&s;ions and render their retreat impo&s;&s;ible. The Convention were too pre&s;umptuous, and too much taken up with the king's trial to attend to the&s;e remon|&s;trances.</P>
<P>One individual of the Convention controlled the department of the finances with the mo&s;t ab&s;o|lute &s;way. This was Cambon a man of a mo&s;t ir|regular mind; ignorant and de&s;titute of &s;ound principles, yet &s;cheming and unrelenting in his projects. D'E&s;pagnac had been arre&s;ted on the 22d of November, along with Malus, for fulfilling an engagement that they had made with Servan re&s;pecting carriages for the army, and which was very important to the nation. He was &s;till a pri|&s;oner at Paris; but at liberty to go about with a guard. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mind abounding in re&s;our|ces. He had gained the confidence of Cambon on all the &s;ubjects of finance, and offered to procure the General a conference with this dictator of the national trea&s;ury; the General con&s;ented and they went to breakfa&s;t with Cambon. This man boa&s;t|ed of having obtained and &s;upported the decree of the 15th of December. His rea&s;ons for the project he &s;aid were that the trea&s;ury was empty; that France had &s;ix hundred thou&s;and troops on foot, and paid two hundred million of livres per month for the expences of the war. The General ob&s;erv|ed that &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men ought not to co&s;t two hundred millions per month, and that the armies of France did not amount to more than three hundred thou&s;and effective men. Cambon an&s;wered, that the national guards of all the fron|tier
<PB N="85" REF="026918_0083_0FD26075968B83D0">
cities received the &s;ame pay as the army, as well as part of the national guards of Paris; he declared he &s;aw no other re&s;ource, than the exe|cution of the decree, for carrying on the war; that &s;pecie already co&s;t the nation fifty per cent, and that &s;oon it would not be procured even at cent per cent.; that he had but one remedy again&s;t this evil, which was to &s;eize on all the &s;pecie in Bel|gia, and the &s;ilver in the churches and banks. He acknowledged this to be unju&s;t, but he thought it unavoidable; he &s;aid, that when the Belgians &s;hould be ruined and reduced to the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s as the French, they would nece&s;&s;arily unite their fate with that of France, as the people of Liege had done, who threw them&s;elves into our arms, being poor and involved in debt. He added, that then France would admit the Belgians as members of the Republic, and with the &s;ame po|licy they might hope to proceed conquering peo|ple after people; that the decree of the 15th of December was well calculated for this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e it tended to di&s;organize the neighbouring &s;tates, that being the mo&s;t fortunate thing that could be done for France.</P>
<P>The General objected that, be&s;ide the barbarity of the project, it was impracticable; that we were now in the middle of the month of January; that our armies were weakened; that no one thought of the means of recruiting them; nor of the plan of the en&s;uing campaign, although on the eve of being opened; that the people of Belgium were entirely aver&s;e to the di&s;organizing prin|ciples of our Revolution; that we had neither time before us to remove what he (Cambon) call|ed their prejudices, nor to cru&s;h them; that in the beginning of the approaching March, the enemy would attack the French po&s;ts upon the Meu&s;e, which were too di&s;tant from each other, and not &s;ufficiently &s;trong; that, ma&s;ters of the

pa&s;&s;age of Mae&s;tricht, they would penetrate the centre of the French line; that the Belgians, finding a power to protect them, would take up arms every where at once, and would put to the &s;word the garri&s;ons in the interior part of Belgium, compo&s;ed of &s;eeble battalions of new levies; that, occupying the po&s;ts behind the French, they would not only cut of the provi&s;ions of the army, but its retreat; that in this &s;ituation the army could not gain France, but would be en|tirely ruined, and thus all would be lo&s;t to the Republic. General Dumourier repre&s;ented, more|over, that the&s;e odious robberies would not pro|duce as much to France as would a ju&s;t conduct toward the Belgians; that it would be more pru|dent to borrow part of the trea&s;ures of the clergy, and &s;o to intere&s;t them in our &s;ucce&s;s, than to &s;eize upon the whole by violence; that, as to &s;pecie, there would be no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ending any from France into Belgium, where it was in abundance; that the true means of putting it in circulation, and at length to replace it by a&s;&s;ig|nats, was to engage the rich merchants of Ant|werp, Bru&s;&s;els, and Ghent, in the furni&s;hing of provi&s;ions, clothing, and all the nece&s;&s;aries for the war; that, in this way, the &s;upply of every thing would be &s;ecured, and the expences re|duced to one half; that the contractors would re|ceive a&s;&s;ignats in payment, and would be com|pelled by their own intere&s;t to give them curren|cy. The General ob&s;erved that the Convention, by annulling the decree of the 15th of December, would effectually free the Belgians, whom they had reduced to a &s;lavery more revolting than their former &s;ervitude; that in this ca&s;e the Belgians would form a free con&s;titution, rai&s;e troops, and join our arms; that this fraternity of arms and mutual &s;ervices would induce them, more effec|tually than any other means, to demand at lea&s;t a

permanent alliance with the Republic, if not an entire union.</P>
<P>Cambon &s;eemed inclined to yield, e&s;pecially when the general promi&s;ed him that, &s;hould the&s;e ju&s;t, moderate and wi&s;e means be adopted, he would not only forbear longer to demand any thing for his army, which the re&s;ources of Bel|gium could provide for in abundance, but that he would procure the French trea&s;ury &s;everal mil|lions by way of loan. He well knew that the Belgians, to withdraw them&s;elves from their pre|&s;ent ruinous &s;lavery, would fulfil the promi&s;es which he now made in their name.</P>
<P>After this fir&s;t conference, Cambon went to the Convention, and, in the heat of the debate, &s;aid in the tribune, that if the decree of the 15th of December was not executed, it would be becau&s;e Dumourier had oppo&s;ed it by the prerogative of his <HI>Veto.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding this dark treachery, in which, to render General Dumourier odious, Cambon a&s;&s;imilated him with the king, who&s;e trial was then pro&s;ecuting with bitterne&s;s, the General con&s;ented to have another interview with him, and even invited him to dinner, together with a deputy named Ducos.</P>
<P>The &s;econd conference, which la&s;ted more than &s;ix hours, was not carried on with much tem|per. General Dumourier having &s;aid that if Cam|bon was re&s;olved upon oppre&s;&s;ing the Belgians, he might &s;eek another General, &s;ince Dumourier never would con&s;ent to become an <HI>Altila</HI> to a peo|ple who had received the French as friends and brethren; Cambon took an opportunity to tell the Convention that nothing could be more indecent than to hear a General threatening to re&s;ign in con&s;equence of every decree that was pa&s;t con|trary to his opinion; that the Republic mu&s;t not re&s;t upon one man, and that they ought either to impo&s;e &s;ilence on the General, or to puni&s;h him.
<PB N="88" REF="026918_0086_0FD26035DA6B8CC0">
In this fruitle&s;s manner terminated the General's conferences with Cambon, whom he expre&s;&s;ly warned again&s;t the events that have &s;ince hap|pened.</P>
<P>It was not without rea&s;on, Cambon had &s;aid, that he was devoid of re&s;ources for the war. In January, there was no more in the national trea|&s;ury than an hundred and ninety-two millions of livres in a&s;&s;ignats, and from fifteen to twenty mil|lions of livres in &s;pecie. The&s;e &s;ums were not &s;ufficient for the army till the month of April, and the whole pre&s;umed value of the lands of the clergy was already con&s;umed by the emi&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;ignats on that fund.</P>
<P>Dumourier acquired this knowledge in the &s;econd &s;itting of the committee of general &s;afe|ty. As it was then re&s;olved to augment the ar|my to three hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and men, he repre&s;ented to the committee, that the de|cree for that purpo&s;e would be u&s;ele&s;s, as was the ca&s;e with others of the &s;ame kind the preceding year, if the mini&s;ter of war did not at the &s;ame time pre&s;ent a &s;tatement of the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary for each particular article belonging to the augmenta|tion, &s;uch as clothing, arms, hor&s;es, &amp;c. and if the Convention did not place the&s;e &s;ums at the im|mediate di&s;po&s;ition of the mini&s;ter of war. Cam|bon, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;itting, acknowledged the truth of the General's ob&s;ervation, but &s;tated the poverty of the trea&s;ury, and &s;aid he knew not on what fund to i&s;&s;ue new a&s;&s;ignats, &s;ince the only re|&s;ource that remained was the national fore&s;ts, and the e&s;tates of the emigrants. In&s;tantly, the vio|lent part of the committee cried out, they had nothing to do but to &s;ell tho&s;e e&s;tates forthwith. Di&s;putes &s;ucceeding, the General reque&s;ted leave to give his opinion.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired the committee to con&s;ider that the lands of the clergy had &s;old exceedingly ill; that
<PB N="89" REF="026918_0087_0FD2607A8B7712E8">
a part &s;till remained un&s;old, the general appre|hen&s;ion being &s;uch that there were no buyers; that, if under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they &s;hould order the &s;ale of the e&s;tates of the emigrants, va|lued at more than twelve hundred millions of livres, this great addition to the lands on &s;ale would &s;till further dimini&s;h the value of the whole, and complete the ruin of the nation; that the di&s;|credit of a&s;&s;ignats recently i&s;&s;ued would be &s;till in|crea&s;ed by this fatal operation; &s;ince the public, judging by the price of the lands, would doubt the &s;ufficiency of the funds on which the a&s;&s;ignats were grounded; for, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould hazard the emi&s;&s;ion of twelve hundred millions on the e&s;tates of the emigrants, as &s;ome members had propo&s;ed, either they would not find purcha&s;ers, or the pro|duce of the &s;ale would not amount to the third of the enormous &s;um; that then the &s;tate would lo&s;e the other two thirds of that &s;um, and Would be me|naced with inevitable bankruptcy.</P>
<P>As to the national fore&s;ts, he repre&s;ented that wood was already very &s;earce in France, and, if they alienated the&s;e fore&s;ts, the purcha&s;ers would cut down the whole; that, be&s;ides the enormous con&s;umption of wood for articles of every kind, France had not a &s;ufficient quantity of coal for fir|ing; and that, independent of this inconvenience, which France would &s;eel for more than a century, this re&s;ource would not produce, at the utmo&s;t, more than two or three hundred millions of livres, although it &s;tood valued at eight hundred mil|lions.</P>
<P>The weight of the&s;e con&s;iderations was acknow|ledged, and it was agreed to leave the&s;e two ob|jects untouched; and thus, General Dumourier &s;aved the e&s;tates of the emigrants for that time: but, neither this &s;ervice, nor many others General Dumourier has rendered the emigrants, could ever obtain him ju&s;tice or candour on their part.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="026918_0088_0FD2603728552260">
The committee re&s;olved upon propo&s;ing to the Convention the i&s;&s;uing of &s;ix hundred millions of livres in a&s;&s;ignats, on the gro&s;s fund of all the national lands, without appropriating any &s;pecific part for the &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>This mode of i&s;&s;uing paper on vague funds is a dangerous practice in finance, and it was this kind of abu&s;e of confidence which ruined <HI>Law</HI>'s &s;y&s;tem in 1720. However, the committee had as yet kept it within bounds. It has &s;ince been car|ried to twelve hundred millions of livres. This is a &s;mooth de&s;cent that leads to bankruptcy; but bankruptcy is the la&s;t re&s;ource of Cambon. He has him&s;elf &s;aid that it is inevitable. As to the Convention they are not employed in con&s;iderati|ons &s;o profound. They have no object but to exi&s;t from day to day, without the trouble of in|quiring what will be the re&s;ult.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Interview of General Dumourier with &s;ome Ja|cobins.</HEAD>
<P>DUMOURIER had been a member of the &s;o|ciety of Jacobins in the early part of its career; but, at that period, neither Marat, Camille De&s;|moulins, Bazire, Merlin, Chabot, nor Bourdon, were known in the &s;ociety, nor the re&s;t of that li&s;t of contemptible characters, afterward cho&s;en, to the &s;urpri&s;e of all ju&s;t men, to form the mo&s;t atrocious a&s;&s;embly in the univer&s;e. The Gene|ral never attended their meetings very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly;
<PB N="91" REF="026918_0089_0FD2607E7A23CA00">
although the adventure of the <HI>red cap,</HI> which he was obliged to put on when he went to the Jacobin &s;ociety on his being made mini&s;ter, might beget an opinion that he was a zealous partizan of the &s;ect.</P>
<P>The following is the hi&s;tory of the fact. Du|mourier told the King, that he imagined it would be u&s;eful to the King's per&s;onal intere&s;t, but e&s;|pecially to the public concerns, for the new mi|ni&s;ters, named by him on the recommendation of the people, and who were members of the Jacobin &s;ociety, to pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the &s;ociety, le&s;t they &s;hould now be &s;u&s;pected of joining the ari&s;tocracy; and he propo&s;ed to at|tend the &s;itting of that evening him&s;elf. The King perceived the importance of the mea&s;ure, and approved of Dumourier's de&s;ign. Some days previous to that, the factions had adopted the <HI>red cap</HI> for the emblem of liberty. Du|mourier, and the Girondine party, who had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed to be the friends of order, and who, indeed, cannot be reproached with having flattered the Jacobins at any period, convinced Pethion, then mayor of Paris, then beloved by the Jacobins, then all-powerful, that this badge a&s;&s;umed by the people, might be productive of the greate&s;t di&s;orders, if not of the horrors at|tending the conte&s;t of the white and red ro&s;es in England, and that of the times of the hoods in King John's reign at Paris. Pethion, at that pe|riod, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ab&s;olute a&s;cendency over Ro|ber&s;pierre and the Jacobins; and promi&s;ed that he would write a note to them on the &s;ubject, and that the red cap &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The day on which Pethion was to write was the &s;ame that Dumourier had cho&s;en for paying his re&s;pects to the Jacobins. The letter was indeed written, but had not arrived when Dumourier entered the hall of the a&s;&s;embly. All the mem|bers
<PB N="92" REF="026918_0090_0FD26038D95BF180">
had red caps on their heads, and a cap was offered to Dumourier as he was mounting the tribune. He was compelled to put it on, or im|prudently to &s;ubject him&s;elf to very great ri&s;ks.&mdash; Dumourier &s;aid little in the tribune. Having a&s;&s;ured them that, when war &s;hould be declared, he would quit his pen to &s;erve them with his &s;word, he left the hall. He was &s;carcely gone, when Pethion's letter was announced and read, and produced the de&s;ired effect, in bani&s;hing the caps from the a&s;&s;embly; &s;o that half an hour would have &s;aved the mini&s;ter this di&s;grace. The public, mi&s;led by fal&s;e royali&s;ts, that is to &s;ay, by the anti-con&s;titutional party, have misjudged this fact, which was but a mere accident.</P>
<P>At the time of Dumourier's quitting the admi|ni&s;tration, the Jacobins were become his bittere&s;t enemies. The General's &s;ucce&s;s in Champagne, had re&s;tored him a little to their favour, in &s;pite of Marat's accu&s;ations; and he appeared at the club, for a quarter of an hour, on his being at Paris, in October 1792. But he never held any corre&s;pondence with the &s;ociety, nor with any one of its members.</P>
<P>Ha&s;&s;enfratz, Andouin, and the other clerks of the war-office, were never ab&s;ent from the meet|ings of the Jacobins. They multiplied accu&s;ati|ons again&s;t the General; and often demanded that he &s;hould be compelled to appear at the bar to an&s;wer their charges. But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e intrigues, the Jacobins were de&s;irous of attach|ing the General to their party. The majority u&s;ually oppo&s;ed his enemies; and, when Ha&s;&s;en|fratz produced his grand accu&s;ation re&s;pecting the embezzlement of two hundred thou&s;and livres, together with the papers to &s;ub&s;tantiate the charge, the &s;ociety &s;ilenced him, and pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="026918_0091_0FD260822F5802A8">
The Jacobins even employed &s;everal of their emi&s;&s;aries, to induce the General to attend their &s;ittings. Anachar&s;is Clootz, u&s;ed various arts to that end; but the General always excu&s;ed him|&s;elf, on the ground that he could not appear at the &s;ociety till he had offered his homage to the Convention. Doctor Seyffer made attempts of the &s;ame nature; as well as Proli, an adventurer of Bru&s;&s;els, who was de&s;irous of procuring at lea&s;t an interview between the General and one Desfieux, a celebrated Jacobin, and one of the mo&s;t active itinerants of the &s;ect, who, arriving at Bourdeaux, found means of di&s;gracing the members of the Girondine party, and of exci|ting the populace again&s;t the hone&s;t part of that great city. Jean-Bon St. Andre, who was a member of the Convention, and an enthu&s;ia&s;tic Jacobin, notwith&s;tanding he had the reputation of being an hone&s;t man, having conceived a great e&s;teem for Dumourier, although he had no per&s;onal acquaintance with the General, was ex|tremely anxious to bring about this interview, and reque&s;ted that he might be pre&s;ent. The General was not &s;atisfied that the adventurer Proli, whom he de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;hould be the medium of this negociation; however, for many impor|tant rea&s;ons, he, at length, con&s;ented to the in|terview.</P>
<P>On the day appointed, the General was indi&s;|po&s;ed; but as he would not, by a violation of his word, &s;eem to be wanting in re&s;pect to Desfieux and St. Andre, to both of whom he was a &s;tranger, he made another appointment to meet them at the hou&s;e of Bonne-Carrere, who was the intimate friend of the&s;e two per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The interview took place at the hou&s;e of Bonne-Carrere. Desfieux appeared to the Ge|neral to be a man of mean capacity, and of a violent di&s;po&s;ition. Jean-Bon St. Andre &s;eemed
<PB N="94" REF="026918_0092_0FD2603F2DB30920">
better informed, and more moderate. No ar|rangement could be made re&s;pecting the mode of the General's pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the Jaco|bin &s;ociety; nor on the conduct the &s;ociety would ob&s;erve towards him, governed as it was by Marat. Dumourier, therefore, declined enter|ing into any engagement to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the &s;ociety; nor did he make any declaration of a contrary intention.</P>
<P>As to the trial of the King, which the General feared to touch upon, excepting very &s;lightly, le&s;t he &s;hould injure the cau&s;e by &s;eeming to be intere&s;ted in it, he &s;aw that Desfieux and Jean-Bonne St. Andre, were governed by &s;avage rage again&s;t the King, which vented it&s;elf in the vile&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;t terms; and he perceived clearly, that he had nothing to hope on that point from the&s;e men.</P>
<P>They vehemently &s;upported Pache and his a&s;&s;ociates, and Desfieux, who called him&s;elf the organ of the Jacobins, reque&s;ted Dumourier to withdraw his accu&s;ations again&s;t the mini&s;ter of war, whom the Jacobins, he &s;aid, were deter|mined to pre&s;erve in his place; and invited the General to join their faction in di&s;gracing Le Brun, Garat, Claviere, and above all, Roland; which mini&s;ters they con&s;idered as the agents of the Girondine party.</P>
<P>The General now re&s;olved to break off the&s;e negociations entirely; and informed Bonne-|Carrere of his determination. But he felt the danger to which he &s;hould expo&s;e him&s;elf in taking this &s;tep; and e&s;pecially in pur&s;uing the plan he had laid down, and which he had an|nounced to the convention, of re&s;igning the command. He well knew, that thenceforth he mu&s;t either join, the Jacobins, and become the accomplice of their crimes, or deprived of the command, his only &s;hield again&s;t his enemies,
<PB N="95" REF="026918_0093_0FD26083D112E150">
he &s;hould be pur&s;ued on the unju&s;t accu&s;ations of Ha&s;&s;enfratz, and delivered over to the execrable Revolutionary Tribunal, that has &s;ince murdered Cu&s;tine on the &s;lighte&s;t pretences.</P>
<P>Dumourier therefore made up his mind upon the cour&s;e he &s;hould pur&s;ue; and which he after|ward adapted to the political circum&s;tances that will be related in the following chapters. Lo&s;ing all hope of &s;aving the king, he now thought only of the means of avenging his death, of &s;aving his unfortunate queen and her &s;on, and, by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a limited monarchy, of putting an end to the frightful di&s;orders that were compleat|ing the di&s;grace and ruin of France.</P>

<P>IT was with the &s;ix mini&s;ters exerci&s;ing the ex|ecutive power in France, that General Dumou|rier tran&s;acted the chief part of his bu&s;ine&s;s dur|ing the twenty-&s;ix days that he pa&s;&s;ed at Paris. And here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that, in a writing he publi&s;hed after that period, by an error in the pre&s;s, twenty-&s;ix hours were put for twenty-&s;ix days. In con&s;equence of which error, a critici&s;m appeared in one of the Engli&s;h papers, in which the general was &s;eriou&s;ly reproached with a&s;&s;erting he had performed, in twenty-&s;ix hours, the bu&s;ine&s;s of twenty-&s;ix days.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters were Roland, to whom we will give a chapter apart. He was hated by the other

five, who concealed all they could from him. They were them&s;elves divided into two very oppo&s;ite parties. One was compo&s;ed of Le Brun, mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, whom Dumourier had made fir&s;t clerk, and who was very fit for that &s;ituation, being indu&s;trious and well informed; but he had neither &s;ufficient dignity nor energy of mind to act for him&s;elf, and was rendered deceitful by his timidity of character, even to|ward his benofactor, although he &s;till regarded him as nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;upport. He had di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed from his office Marat and Noel, two men neither deficient in talents nor honeily; had ap|pointed no per&s;on to &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s of the office, and to di&s;tribute the work to the dif|ferent &s;uperior clerks; and he had taken for his principal &s;ecretary a man of the name of I&s;abeau, who&s;e reputation was none of the faire&s;t. Occu|pied, like mini&s;ters of former times, by intrigues for the pre&s;ervation of his place, he was more influenced by the Jacobins than became a man, to whom Bri&s;&s;ot, Condorcet, and the other heads of the Girondine party dictated the policy of his foreign negociations.</P>
<P>Of the faction of Le Brun was Garat, mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, a man of an able and upright mind, and to whom no reproach could be made except|ing that, by an adulation unworthy of him&s;elf, he had endeavoured to apologize for the well known murders of the fir&s;t days of September. Grou|velle, although only &s;ecretary of the council, may be con&s;idered as having all the influence of a mini&s;ter, &s;ince he a&s;&s;umed much authority and gave his opinion, and decided on every thing.&mdash; He was a man of letters, overbearing, and open in his avowal of bold and extravagant notions of liberty.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide was Pache, mini&s;ter of war, a man of &s;en&s;e, and po&s;&s;ibly an hone&s;t man, but
<PB N="97" REF="026918_0095_0FD260419A7D6710">
ignorant and blindly devoted to the Jacobin party. He had a wife and daughter, equally ugly and ill tempered, who frequented the clubs and even the haunts of the Mar&s;eillois, to demand the king's death. The war-office was become a club, breath|ing nothing but blood and carnage. The clerks always wore the red cap at their de&s;ks, and u&s;ed the phra&s;es <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI> to every one, even to the mini&s;ter, who him&s;elf affected a &s;lovenly dre&s;s, and courted the Pari&s;ian populace, by a&s;&s;uming their manners.</P>
<P>The &s;ame di&s;gu&s;ting &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf in the office of the marine department, from which all the clerks of character and experience were driven, to make way for ignorant and furious Jacobins, who, notwith&s;tanding the filthine&s;s of their appear|ance, have acquired immen&s;e fortunes.</P>
<P>The war-office and that of the marine depart|ment, united in pre&s;enting an addre&s;s to the Na|tional Convention, &s;igned al&s;o, as it was &s;aid, by the two mini&s;ters, demanding that the king &s;hould be put to death. Monge, the mini&s;ter of the ma|rine, was an academician, had been an excellent lecturer in hydrography, and &s;eemed a man of &s;imple manners, but was a little ungracious in his behaviour. He was entirely devoted to Pache; and, in concert with him, &s;upported the Jacobin faction in the council.</P>
<P>Claviere, mini&s;ter of the finances, although he was connected with and &s;upported by the Giron|di&s;ts, and was the relation of Bri&s;&s;ot, frequently joined the other faction, from a love of contradic|tion, and becau&s;e it was the mo&s;t active and pow|erful. Like the re&s;t, he thought of nothing but of pre&s;erving his place, which Cambon, and the committee of finance were endeavouring to &s;up|pre&s;s.</P>

and &s;ad reflection naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf; the French Revolution, under the pretence of equa|lizing all men, has deba&s;ed all men. Mo&s;t of the Jacobins, belonged to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the peo|ple; and, unable to find among them&s;elves per&s;ons equal to the fir&s;t &s;tations, they lowered the nature of tho&s;e &s;tations to their own level. Hence, there is neither dignity, nor character, in the govern|ment: nor re&s;pectability, nor a &s;en&s;e of duty in the people; and the populace, unlike the Athenian democracy, are drunken and &s;avage &s;laves, u&s;urp|ing the place of the Spartans. The ancient go|vernment was de&s;troyed to remedy the abu&s;e of di&s;tributing places among the nobles, without any regard to their moral capacities.

<P>France cannot e&s;cape her entire ruin, But in freeing her&s;elf from the &s;ubaltern tyrants that in|vade every department.

But the ignorance and barbarous rage of this horde is de&s;tructive of it&s;elf; and foreign arms will re&s;tore the ancient de&s;poti&s;m, in&s;tead of forming that ju&s;t equilibrium between the talents of men and the employments of the &s;tate that con&s;titutes the perfection of go|vernment. This &s;tate of things however, cannot remain long; becau&s;e the love of liberty is too deeply rooted in France to be ever again wholly de&s;troyed; and the re&s;toration of de&s;poti&s;m will beget another revolution, the moment that foreign troops &s;hall be withdrawn from the country, and &s;hall leave the nobles of France, &s;cattered over that va&s;t kingdom, to the vengeance of the people, called down on their heads by the abu&s;e of their &s;hort lived triumph.</P>

The council did not interfere in the fate of the king. Le Brun and Garat, &s;eemed to apprehend the con&s;equences of the trial; but they feared to employ the means, or to indulge in the idea, of putting a &s;top to it, or of &s;u&s;pending it; and con|fined them&s;elves to a declaration, that it was un|fortunate for France that &s;uch a trial had commen|ced. Roland was the mo&s;t terrified of all the mini&s;ters at this trial; becau&s;e, in reflecting on the imprudence, and on the inju&s;tice of his former complaints again&s;t the King, no doubt he felt that he was the principal cau&s;e of the king's danger. He relented and was &s;ilent. It belonged to the malignant mind of Claviere, to rejoice at the trial; and be&s;ides, he had always di&s;covered a per&s;onal hatred again&s;t Louis XV<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> As to Pache and Monge, they canva&s;&s;ed openly for the king's death. And Grouvelle declared, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to the honour of the Republic, that he &s;hould die.</P>
<P>The open and bitter quarrels that exi&s;ted be|tween the mini&s;ter of war and the generals, on the complaints made by the latter respecting the armies, and the providing of nece&s;&s;aries for the troops, could never bring the council to take any &s;tep in its collective capacity relative to tho&s;e &s;ub|jects. Exery one of the members re&s;erved an exclu&s;ive authority in his own department; and Pache laid before the council, as well as before the committee of war, &s;tatements which were al|together fal&s;e, and which were uniformly oppo&s;ed by new complaints from the Generals, and by the reports of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention with the armies. The council heard all the re|ports and complaints, but they &s;till upheld the committee of contracts, which was &s;ecretly influ|enced by Claviere, the friend of Bidermann, who was at the head of the committee; and the affairs of the armies were conducted as before. No pro|vi&s;&s;ion was made either for the clothing &s;ub&s;i&s;t|once,

or acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ments of the troops, nor for the ho&s;pitals, nor for the ammunition that was wanted in the frontier places, nor for the works nece&s;&s;ary to put them in a &s;tate of defence. At that time the Jacobins had re&s;olved to place one of their faction at the head of the municipality, and had promi&s;ed to make Pache mayor of Paris; he, therefore, gave him&s;elf little unea&s;ine&s;s re|&s;pecting the future embarra&s;&s;ments of the war department; which Ha&s;&s;enfratz and Meu&s;nier were to quit along with him.</P>
<P>The more we reflect on the conduct of the Ja|cobins, the more are we lo&s;t in conjecture re&s;|pecting the &s;pirit by which they were guided. It is certain, that they have been continually in|du&s;trious to di&s;organize France, and to render u&s;ele&s;s the immen&s;e re&s;ources &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for the defence of her liberty; they have ruined the fleets and armies; they have impri&s;oned or driven out of the kingdom, the able&s;t officers; they have lavi&s;hed the trea&s;ures of the nation in wild and ineffectual expences; they have de&s;troyed the commercial and political connections of France with other nations; and have &s;et every nation at defiance; and it cannot be doubted, that the &s;o|ciety has been influenced by Engli&s;h, Italians, Flemings and Germans, pretending to be furious Jacobins, and who were known to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;pies of foreign governments. In this cla&s;s may be ranked Clootz, Marat, Chabot, Pio, the Jew Ephraim, De Bu&s;cher, and many others.</P>
<P>The decree of the 15th of December, far from being di&s;approved of by the Council, was &s;up|ported by every one of the members, Le Brun had been &s;ecretary to the people of Liege, during this revolution, to which he had given his &s;up|port by a periodical work, entitled, "The Jour|nal of Europe." This paper was not ill written; and it was in con&s;equence of &s;eeing it, that Du|mourier
<PB N="101" REF="026918_0099_0FD2614DD4965708">
had placed him at the department of fo|reign affairs. Le Brun was of opinion, as well as mo&s;t of the other revolutioni&s;ts of France, that a revolution could not be &s;ucce&s;sful without be|ing attended by a complete di&s;organization; &s;o that he could not fail to approve of a decree, cal|culated to di&s;organize a people, who had the misfortune to call upon us for aid. The prin|ciples of Dumourier, which inclined him to re&s;pect the liberty, property, and opinions of others, could not be very acceptable to Le Brun. But Le Brun was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject to Dumou|rier, although he, in concert with Marat, Chepy, and his other emi&s;&s;aries, had e&s;tabli&s;hed a de|&s;tructive engine in Belgium, under the name of the Revolutionary Committee. The General complained to the mini&s;ter of the language and conduct of Chepy, de&s;iring he might be recalled, as being dangerous to the affairs of France in Belgium. Le Brun, however, not only counte|nanced Chepy, but gave him new in&s;tructions that greatly extended his power.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner while the General was &s;oliciting the revocation of the decree of the 15th of December, the council appointed, on the re|commendation of the Jacobins, thirty-two com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Executive Power, to who&s;e &s;itu|ation was annexed the &s;alary of 10,000 livres, be&s;ides the expences of their journey, and the profits of their robberies. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners were furni&s;hed with ridiculous in&s;tructions, in which the council feigned to confine their au|thority within narrow bounds; but the commi&s;|&s;ioners paid no regard to their in&s;tructions, having them&s;elves given an arbitrary latitude to their power. The&s;e mi&s;creants inflicted the greate&s;t wrongs on the Belgians, and cau&s;ed among that people an utter abhorrence of the French name.</P>

The plan of the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">paign remained yet to be &s;ettled. Cambon had a&s;&s;erted that France main|tained 600,000 troops. It was now the 15th of January, and the council knew not how many troops France really had on foot, nor how many enemies &s;he would have to contend with, in the campaign. The General &s;lated to the Council that, although all Europe &s;hould declare again&s;t France, &s;he having no civil war, (for the revolt in La Vendee had not yet broken out) might defend her frontiers with three hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and men (the &s;ixth part, of them being cavalry) exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;ons and troops of the fleet, by &s;tanding on the defen&s;ive on the &s;outh and on the banks of the Rhine, and confining their offen&s;ive opera|tions to the frontiers extending from the Mozelle to Dunkirk. The General propo&s;ed to di&s;tribute the troops in the following manner: 80,000 men to compo&s;e the army of Belgium; 40,000 men that of the Ardennes; a corps of 20,000 to be po&s;ted on the Mozelle, to keep open the commu|nication between the armies of the Ardennes and that of the Rhine; 50,000 to compo&s;e the army of the Rhine; a re&s;erve of 20,000 men to be placed at Chalons or Soi&s;&s;ons; a corps of 15,000 at Lyons, to watch Switzerland and Pied<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt; 40,000 for the army of Savoy and countries of Nice and Provence; 25,000 for the army of the Pyrennees; 40,000 for the coa&s;t of the We&s;t, from Bayonne to Bre&s;t; and 40,000 for the coa&s;ts along the channel, from Bre&s;t to Dunkirk. All the&s;e armies might mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; and, as the whole of France was armed, even &s;hould the enemy penetrate any part, it was not to be doubted they would be repul&s;ed or overwhelmed.</P>
<P>General Dumourier al&s;o propo&s;ed that Cu&s;tine's army, which had already evacuated Franckfort, &s;hould fall back upon Landan, leaving a garri&s;on
<PB N="103" REF="026918_0101_0FD26089A96BFD18">
in Mayence &s;ufficient to compel the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia to lo&s;e three or four months before that place, which would afford time to put the fortified towns of Al&s;ace, Lorraine, and the Ardennes, into a proper &s;tate of defence, and to make the enemy on that &s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e the re&s;t of the campaign.</P>
<P>The General further propo&s;ed that the greate&s;t efforts &s;hould be made to pu&s;h the campaign on with vigour on the &s;ide of Belgium, becau&s;e that being a flat country without fortified places, or even without any of tho&s;e naturally &s;trong &s;itua|tions of country which &s;tand in the place of for|tre&s;&s;es, the fate of the war in the&s;e provinces mu&s;t be decided by battles. On this &s;cheme, if the French &s;hould be victorious, the greater part of the French army might pa&s;s the Rhine: and if un&s;ucce&s;sful, might retire behind the fortre&s;&s;es of Flanders and Artois; however the whole cam|paign might pa&s;s without the French lines being broke in upon in this quarter.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of this plan, which Dumourier laid before the Committee of General Safety, as well as the Executive Council, La Clos, who had ju&s;t been appointed to the command in India, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould in&s;tantly &s;end him out with fifteen ve&s;&s;els and 15,000 men, which mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;a|rily involved a war with England and Holland, although it had then been very ea&s;y and was very nece&s;&s;ary to the fafety of France to have avoided that war.</P>
<P>The object of this expedition of La Clos was to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Cape of Good Hope and the i&s;land of Ceylon; and afterwards, to join Tippoo Saib and to attack Bengal.</P>
<P>Kellermann, on paying his re&s;pects to the Na|tional Convention, on his departure to take the command of the army of Dauphine, which amount|ed to nearly twenty thou&s;and men (exclu&s;ive of the army of the country of Nice, under General
<PB N="104" REF="026918_0102_0FD260C03B174DD8">
Biron, from ten to twelve thou&s;and men) re|ceived orders from the Pre&s;ident to go and conquer Rome; and the General gravely an|&s;wered, that he took his leave to go to Rome. This army had al&s;o been weakened by draw|ing between &s;even and eight thou&s;and men from it, for the fleet that lay at Toulon, de&s;tined to conquer Sardinia. This expedition was under|taken in the mo&s;t &s;tormy part of the year, in a narrow &s;ea, abounding with rocks and i&s;lands; and part of the fleet was lo&s;t, and the expedition failed.</P>
<P>The army of the Pyrennees con&s;i&s;ted only of an exten&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;taff officers, without troops. Yet the Convention had re&s;olved upon conquering Spain, and had de&s;tined 40,000 men, that were not rai&s;ed, and General Servan, for the purpo&s;e. There were 110 troops on the coa&s;t of the we&s;t and north; excepting &s;ome weak gar|ri&s;ons at Belle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;le, and at two or three other places on that coa&s;t. There was no army of re&s;erve. Fifty thou&s;and men were wanting to complete the army of Belgium and that of the Ardennes; the army of Al&s;ace did not amount to 20,00 men, exclu&s;ive of 22,000 &s;hut up in Mayence; and the army of the Mozelle did not amount to 12,000 men.</P>
<P>In order therefore to put the plan of General Dumourier in execution, there were wanting more than 150,000 men; together with the provi&s;ions, arms, and clothing, for this large body of troops. Above all, France was in want of cavalry. The armies of Belgium and of the Ardennes required a body of 20,000 cavalry; and the two armies had not 6,000; and they were in want of 15,000 ar|tillery hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The General's plan was adopted; the 370,000 men were decreed to be rai&s;ed; and a few altera|tions made in the di&s;tribution of the troops; but
<PB N="105" REF="026918_0103_0FD2608BC3D10918">
this was all that over was done towards the exe|cution of the plan. However, the General ob|tained an order a few days before his departure for 15,000 men of the new-rai&s;ed battalions to march from the third line in Pieardy, Flanders, and Artois, where they were altogether u&s;ele&s;s, into mariti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nders.</P>
<P>Independent of the Executive Council, from which (as Le Brun and Garat &s;u&s;pected) a great many projects were concealed, e&s;pecially tho&s;e re&s;pecting foreign politics, there were two pri|vate committees held at the hou&s;e of General Du|mourier, which &s;eemed to di&s;po&s;e of the fate of the empire; and which in fact produced nothing. They were compo&s;ed of the two mini&s;ters Le Brun and Garat, and tho&s;e members of the Girondine party, Condorcet, Pethion, Gen&s;onne and Bri&s;&s;ot. It is probable that the only object of the party, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e committees, was that their exi&s;tence &s;hould be known to Paris, in order to beget an opinion that the General was entirely devoted to them; and thereby to &s;trengthen the party, by the acqui&s;ition of his friends. Le Brun even &s;eemed unwilling that the negociations then carrying on with England and Holland &s;hould be at all enquired into by the committees; and re|que&s;ted the General to forbear touching on the &s;ubject; and it was never introduced.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot boa&s;ted of his plans for the conque&s;t of Spain and Italy; but the General ea&s;ily detected the folly of his calculations.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Republic with Switzerland, was an intere&s;ting &s;ubject. The malignity of Cla|viere, had been lately gratified, in compelling General Monte&s;quieu to become an exile to e&s;cape the fangs of his per&s;ecutor the vile Du Bois de Crance; and, in di&s;organizing Geneva, his na|tive country. Bri&s;&s;ot and his adherents maintained, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to compel the Swi&s;s Can|tons
<PB N="106" REF="026918_0104_0FD260C19632F7D8">
to abandon, their neutrality; or, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al to attack them; and it is probable that in this they were acted upon by the agents of the combined powers, to whom it was very important that Switzerland &s;hould join the confederacy. The General proved by arguments, drawn from the relative &s;ituations of France, Switzerland, and the Combined Powers, to which these meta|phy&s;icians were &s;trangers, that it was prudent to conciliate the good di&s;po&s;itions of the Helvetic body towards France; yet, at the &s;ame time to maintain an army of 15,000 men to cover Lyons, and to be ready on any emergency on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>Dumourier was the more de&s;irous of pre&s;erving this neutrality, becau&s;e it was during his admini|&s;tration, that the event of the di&s;arming the regi|ment of Erne&s;t happened at Aix. At that period, he made every compen&s;ation he could to that brave regiment, for the inju&s;tice of his countrymen; he pre&s;ented the red ribband to the two principal of|ficers, and provided for the &s;afety of their retreat with their men to the frontiers.</P>
<P>General Dumourier always exerted every means in his power to pre&s;erve peace with Switzerland; a mea&s;ure that was &s;o ju&s;t, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of the two nations. But he mu&s;t own, that his efforts have le&s;s contributed to that difficult ta&s;k, than the prudent and firm conduct of Colonel de Wei&s;s, a member of the &s;overeign council of Berne, and a writer di&s;tingui&s;hed by works which di&s;play exten&s;ive knowledge, energy of mind, and goodne&s;s of heart. This officer, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any o&s;ten&s;ible diplomatic cha|racter, was re&s;pected by the mini&s;try, was li&s;ten|ed to in the committees, and had even acquired an influence in the convention. Tranquil when &s;urrounded by danger, and uncorrupted in the mid&s;t of crimes, he had the courage to &s;ay to one of the leaders of &s;action, <HI>I know that you can cau&s;e me

<P>His work entitled, <HI>A rapid &s;urvey of the rela|tive interests of the Helvetic body, and the French Republic,</HI> which was publi&s;hed in a cri&s;is of great danger to both countries, expo&s;ed and defeated the ho&s;tile projects of a faction, towards Switzer|land, on the eve of execution; and it is very probable that, without the fore&s;ight and courage of Colonel de Wei&s;s, war had been declared a|gain&s;t the Helvetic body before the end of Fe|bruary. Various &s;ecret preparations were already making for an attack upon Switzerland, in pur|&s;uit of an ill dige&s;ted plan of Robert, Claviere, and other Swi&s;s emigrants. The attack was to be made on three points at once. A column, com|po&s;ed of part of the army of the Upper Rhine, and augmented by new levies, was to take Ba&s;le by &s;urprize, or a&s;&s;ault, and keep the Au&s;trians in check. Another column, drawn from the army of the Alps, was to blockade Geneva, where the French had numerous partizans, and to pe|netrate by Ver&s;oix into the Pays de Vaud. The third divi&s;ion, compo&s;ed of cho&s;en troops, was to march &s;uddenly by the Pa&s;s of Porentru, al|ready occupied by the French, against Berne, who&s;e trea&s;ury, granaries, and ar&s;enal, excited
<PB N="108" REF="026918_0106_0FD260C64C738FA0">
the cupidity of the projectors of this plan. Berne had been already &s;ecretly reconnoitred; and, al|though it be nearly &s;urrounded by a rapid and deep river, it was expected that the place would be carried, by pouring in bombs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed-hot balls from the neighbouring heights, before the Swi&s;s militia could a&s;&s;emble with force to oppo&s;e the attack. The projectors of the plan al&s;o ex|pected a powerful diver&s;ion to be made in their behalf, by the di&s;contented party, (who&s;e num|bers were greatly exaggerated) of the Lower Va|lais, Neuf-Chatel, Pays de Vaud, Soleure, Lu|cerne, and Fribourg, This la&s;t city was de&s;tined to be an object of &s;ignal vengeance, on account of &s;ome offence &s;he had committed re&s;pecting the a&s;&s;ignats. The popular governments were to be informed that the&s;e ho&s;tilities would not affect them, and that France would continue to pre&s;erve peace with them. As to the other cantons, the commi&s;&s;ioners and other &s;editious preachers were to overthrow their con&s;titutions, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r up the poor again&s;t the rich, ma&s;&s;acre, impri&s;on, or bani&s;h the magi&s;trates and principal citizens, &s;eize upon &s;pecic, provi&s;ions, hor&s;es, and arms, compel men of property to emigrate that their e&s;tates might be confi&s;cated, outrage religion, and in the name of liberty and the public good to ruin this free and happy people, and reduce them to &s;la|very. The expedition was to have been prompt; but the explo&s;ion was prevented, and Claviere and Bri&s;&s;ot, overawed by Wei&s;s, laid a&s;ide a pro|ject in which Switzerland, from the character of the times, had every thing to hazard.</P>
<P>The conque&s;t of Rome and Spain, were de&s;er|red till armies could be rai&s;ed to march again&s;t tho&s;e countries.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Retreat of Roland from the Admini&s;tration.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time of the king's death, Roland, who had long &s;trove to maintain his &s;ituation in the mini&s;try, again&s;t the will of the Jacobins, as well as again&s;t the real inclinations of his own party, &s;ent a letter to his colleagues announcing his re|&s;ignation. The mini&s;ters never appeared more chearful than on the day they received this letter, and the council appeared more like a &s;chool re|lieved from the re&s;traints of a trouble&s;ome pe|dant, than a grave meeting of State&s;men. Ro|land's re&s;ignation, made part of a compromi&s;e between the Jacobin and Gironde parties, in which it was agreed, that both Roland and Pache &s;hould quit the mini&s;try. But the con&s;equences were very different to tho&s;e two mini&s;ters, the latter of them acquiring a &s;ituation of more real importance than any in the mini&s;try; while the former remained more than ever expo&s;ed to the infults and per&s;ecutions of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>This &s;acrifice made of Roland by his party, is another in&s;tance of the cowardice of that faction, which ought never to have abandoned a man, of
<PB N="110" REF="026918_0108_0FD260CA92B79870">
who&s;e &s;ervices they had availed them&s;elves, with|out any re&s;pect to his peace or &s;afety. In truth, the whole conduct of Roland, in his public cha|racter, was a mi&s;taken policy, which expo&s;ed him&s;elf and his party to Continual danger. Ro|land did not po&s;&s;e&s;s much &s;trength of mind, but had acquired exten&s;ive information on the diffe|rent branches of trade and manufactures; and, if it had been expedient to divide the duties of the admin&s;tration of the home department, which was too exten&s;ive and too complicated for a mind of &s;uch little energy, it is probable, he would have made an excellent mini&s;ter of com|mercial concerns. He was upright in his de|&s;igns, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mild and philan|thropic di&s;po&s;ition; but the de&s;ire of appearing a rigid morali&s;t induced him to a&s;&s;ume a &s;everity of character unnatural to him. He hoped to re&s;em|ble Cato the Cen&s;or, and had adopted his turn of conver&s;ation, at once cold and repul&s;ive, but without the genius and boldne&s;s of that celebra|ted man. In his dre&s;s he was nice and &s;ingular, following the fa&s;hions of former times; but this was at lea&s;t le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing than the &s;lovenly affec|tation of the Jacobins. His deportment was grave, and not unbecoming the dignity of his &s;tation. He was indefatigable in the application of his ta|lents. But he loved too much to gratify the will of the people, and was too ready to believe that the higher orders were oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t; and this di&s;po&s;ition, that becomes dangerous when it is too generally indulged, conducted him habitu|ally into precipitate and imprudent mea&s;ures.&mdash; He was candid in his examination of the &s;ubjects belonging to the other departments of the govern|ment, &s;uch as tho&s;e relating to the armies, the marine, and foreign negociations; and &s;uppported, with great &s;incerity, all propo&s;itions that came before the council of a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable na|ture.

<P>Perhaps it was prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of Roland that he was governed by his wife, who was a woman of fine talents, and whom he ac|knowledged to be the critic, that gave a poli&s;h to his numerous works; but certainly it was among his misfortunes to be &s;urrounded by ignorant and de&s;igning journali&s;ts, who compo&s;ed, under his directions, tho&s;e verbo&s;e harangues that covered the walls and public buildings of Paris; for the

Jacobins had the addre&s;s to turn this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gine of faction again&s;t him and his party.</P>
<P>Among the women who have ri&s;en to celebrity during the French revolution, no one has acted a more con&s;picuous or noble part than that of Ma|dame Roland. She was between thirty and forty years of age, had a lively and healthy counte|nance, and a mo&s;t intere&s;ting figure; &s;he dre&s;&s;ed with great ta&s;te; conver&s;ed with ability; although perhaps with too much wit and re&s;inement; &s;he was innocently gay, and had placed her&s;elf at the head of a party con&s;i&s;ting of metaphy&s;icians, &s;cholars, members of the Convention, and mi|ni&s;ters. Every day the&s;e partizans of Madame Roland paid their re&s;pects to her, and on the Fri|day of every week they dined at her hou&s;e, where the conduct and politics of &s;tate&s;men took their character from Madame Roland's opinions.&mdash; None of the wives of the other mini&s;ters were admitted to the&s;e meetings.</P>
<P>It would be unju&s;t not to notice the &s;pirit with which Madame Roland conducted her&s;elf under an in&s;ult of the Jacobins, at a time when her hu&s;band's name had already fallen into great di&s;|credit. Interrogated at the bar of the Conven|tion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;pecting the injurious accuiations of an unprincipled man named Viard, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>I am the wife of citizen Roland; I bear the name of a virtuous man, to whom I am proud to be allied.</HI>&mdash; Certainly it required all the malignity of the Ja|cobins to per&s;ecute &s;uch a woman.</P>
<P>Although Madame Roland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much good &s;en&s;e, &s;he permitted it to be &s;een that &s;he governed her hu&s;band, and thereby did a di&s;&s;er|vice to his reputation, for which &s;he could not compen&s;ate by the value of her councils. It was Madame Roland that &s;elected Pache and Lanthe mas to aid her hu&s;band in his admini&s;tration; and the former of them &s;o entirely gained the con&s;i|dence
<PB N="113" REF="026918_0111_0FD260912B2FC558">
of Roland, that he was appointed mini&s;ter of war through Roland's intere&s;t. Pache was no &s;ooner the colleague of Roland, than he became his enemy, and &s;ought by every means to ruin him, and for that purpo&s;e he did not he&s;itate to become the parti&s;an of the mo&s;t intemperate men among the Jacobins. The conte&s;t between tho&s;e two mini&s;ters was open, and their ho&s;tile attacks were without mea&s;ure or decency. They both de&s;cended from their &s;ituations, but with Pache it was only to ri&s;e to higher power. Roland was to be &s;ubjected to new and more bitter misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>Other women have al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves during the revolution, but without the dig|nity that has been pre&s;erved by Madame Roland; excepting, indeed, it be Madame Necker, who, in many re&s;pects, may be con&s;idered as the rival of Madame Roland's fame, and who&s;e age and experience, if it rendered her le&s;s agreeable to the thoughtle&s;s, gave her the advantage as the coun&s;ellor of her hu&s;band. Mademoi&s;elle La Brou&s;&s;et, Madame de Stael, Condorcet, Pa&s;toret, Coigny and Theroigne, were either artful females, like tho&s;e who haunted the courts of former times, or differed in nothing from the vulgar and furious women of the Fauxbourgs of Paris.</P>
<P>One unfortunate woman, Elizabeth Corday, has con&s;igned her name to hi&s;tory, by an act, which happily for humanity will find few imi|tators, although it delivered the earth from a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>The executive council &s;eemed to have under|gone no change by the retreat of Roland from the mini&s;try. During a con&s;iderable period be|fore his re&s;ignation, he had been entirely occu|pied in brooding over his vexations, the attacks of his enemies, and the means of his defence. Every &s;atire of the Jacobins that was directed

again&s;t him, begat in his apprehen&s;ion the obliga|tion of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf to the Convention; and the members of the Convention, who, perhaps, were more irritated by the au&s;terity of Roland's virtue, than by the petulance of his &s;pirit, &s;aw nothing in tho&s;e homilies but an in&s;upportable pride. His own party, no longer deriving repu|tation from his name, had, in truth, renounced him; and had very ignorantly re&s;olved to &s;acri|fice him. Roland flattered him&s;elf that his re&s;ig|nation would not be accepted, and he remained in the hou&s;e appropriated to the mini&s;ter of the Home Department, till he was no longer per|mitted to doubt of his fate. During the latter part of his admini&s;tration, he &s;eldom &s;lept in this hou&s;e; as the Jacobins, to terrify him, frequently &s;ent bands of the foederates to make excur&s;ions during the night round the hou&s;e. In this man|ner were the repre&s;entatives of the executive power treated in France. Le Brun and Claviere have been &s;ince accu&s;ed and impri&s;oned; and Garat was accu&s;ed and arre&s;ted after having re|&s;igned. So ferocious has been the character of this revolution that, of the men who have had an eminent part in it, &s;uch only have been out of the reach of a violent death as have fled and are in exile.</P>

<P>FRANCE, at that period, had no other de|clared enemies than Au&s;tria, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ia, and Sar|dinia. She had di&s;played a &s;uperiority over tho&s;e powers during the preceding campaign, which would have been entirely deci&s;ive, if, according to the plan of General Dumourier; Cu&s;tine, in|&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine to levy an incon&s;ider|able contribution on Frankfort, and for which France paid &s;o dearly, had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Coblentz, where there was no garri&s;on; and if the wants of the army had been &s;upplied, &s;o that the army of Belgium might have taken up its winter quarters along the banks of the Rhine, from Cleves to Cologne; that of the Ardennes, from Cologne to Andernach; that of the Mo|zelle, from Andernach to Mayence, including Coblentz; and that of Al&s;ace, from Mayence to Landau, including Spires. This po&s;ition would have compelled the county of Luxembourg to have &s;urrendered, by cutting off its &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. The armies would have had behind them a country on which, whether it were neuter or an enemy, they might long have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and, by opening the campaign early in the &s;pring, might have pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine without difficulty, and have penetrated into the center of Germany, where the French would have been received with open arms, if they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the prudence to have forborne from exciting terror in the inhabi|tants
<PB N="116" REF="026918_0114_0FD260D10CB8DDD0">
by unju&s;t decrees and by the &s;ending of ra|pacious commi&s;&s;ioners to commit violence, in&s;ults and robberies.</P>
<P>This great plan was neglected; yet France might have &s;u&s;tained her&s;elf with reputation and effect again&s;t her enemies who were in truth al|ready overcome, if her conduct and not drawn new enemies upon her.</P>
<P>Means exi&s;ted, at this period, for pre&s;erving Spain in her neutrality; and by employing them the nation would have &s;pared her&s;elf the guilt of a great crime. The king of Spain engaged with the Convention to remain neuter, on condition that the life of the unfortunate Louis XVI. &s;hould be &s;pared. This &s;tep does honour to the Spani&s;h monarch: and it is difficult to imagine why the French princes did not follow &s;o bright an exam|ple. The implacable, ignorant Convention re|jected the terms of the Spani&s;h monarch with di&s;|dain, and thereby committed a new crime again&s;t the nation, by creating her a new enemy, without con&s;ulting her on the nece&s;&s;ity or prudence of their conduct.</P>
<P>The courts of London and the Hague, had for &s;ome time betrayed a hatred to the French revolu|tion; and the death of Louis XVI. could not but increa&s;e that hatred. But, in England, no part of the nation was willing to enter into a war again&s;t France, excepting the king, who con&s;ider|ed his differences with the French as a per&s;onal quarrel. And in Holland, every party dreaded to be drawn into a war. It was therefore po&s;&s;ible for France to pre&s;erve peace with tho&s;e two coun|tries; and, till that period, &s;he had wi&s;ely culti|vated the good will of Holland, from whence &s;he drew &s;pecie and provi&s;ions; and it was ea&s;y to have continued that &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the month of November, General Dumourier propo&s;ed to the executive
<PB N="117" REF="026918_0115_0FD260971C6F4C00">
council, the taking of Mae&s;tricht, without which he could neither defend the Meu&s;e nor the country of Leige. He thought it rea&s;onable, after many examples in former wars, to take and hold this place, engaging by a duly authori&s;ed manife&s;to, to re&s;tore it at the end of the war. At that period his army was victorious and full of ardour. He had, after the taking of the citadel of Antwerp, a&s;&s;embled the whole of his heavy artillery at Tongres and Leige, in order not to expo&s;e the hor&s;es belonging to the artillery to die for want of &s;orage, (as the Jacobins have &s;tupidly a&s;&s;erted) but to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Mae&s;tricht. That place was not as yet pali&s;adoed, nor provided with a garri&s;on, nor with any thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege. Venloo was in the &s;ame condition. Cau&s;es of complaint were not wanting to give a colour to the enterprize; and to throw the impu|tation of being the aggre&s;&s;ors upon the Dutch, if they &s;hould re&s;ent his conduct, for they had al|ready frequently violated the neutrality, and had recently prohibited on pain of death, all exporta|tions of provi&s;ions to France, while provi&s;ions in immen&s;e quantities were drawn from Holland, to e&s;tabli&s;h magazines, on the Lower Rhine, for the Imperiali&s;ts and Pru&s;&s;ians. The executive coun|cil rejected the general's propo&s;itions, and ex|pre&s;sly commanded him to pre&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t neutrality toward Holland, which injunction the general was punctual in ob&s;erving. They then &s;ent him an order to undertake the &s;iege of Lux|embourg during the winter; but, the general &s;hewing the ab&s;urdity of the plan, it was not put in execution.</P>
<P>As the executive council had thus neglected the opportunity of &s;eizing upon Mae&s;tricht, which may be regarded as the key of the Netherlands on the &s;ide of the Meu&s;e, the general was of opinion that it would no longer be prudent to commit any
<PB N="118" REF="026918_0116_0FD260D35CAE6070">
ho&s;tility on the part of France again&s;t Holland, being convinced that a war with England mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of &s;uch ho&s;tility; and his advice was thenceforward to pre&s;erve a neutrality with both England and Holland, with the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of Holland was indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to enable France to hold Belgium, for if the Dutch delivered the pa&s;&s;ages of Mae&s;tritcht and Venloo to the Au&s;trians, the Meu&s;e would be no longer tenable, and the French would be com|pelled to abandon the countries of Leige, Guel|dre, Limbourg, Brabant, and Namur, and retreat behind the Scheld: contracting their lines within the country lying between the citadel of Antwerp and Valenciennes. And in the ca&s;e of the Engli&s;h and Dutch a&s;&s;embling an army in Dutch Flanders, the French would be further forced to abandon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scheld, and retire behind the river Lys, and under the fortified places of French Flan|ders and Artois.</P>
<P>At this time there were at Paris many Dutch refugees victims of the Dutch revolution, and of the faithle&s;s and feeble conduct of the mini&s;ter Brienne. Many among them were re&s;pectable and opulent men, who a&s;&s;ured the French mini&s;try that their party in Holland was much more con&s;i|derable than that of the Stadtholder, which indeed was true. The&s;e repre&s;entations were di&s;regarded till the month of January, when Le Brun after giving them an hearing, re&s;erred them to General Dumourier for his opinion re&s;pecting their re|&s;ources, and e&s;pecially re&s;pecting a plan of inva|ding Zealand which the Dutch patriots repre&s;ented as ea&s;y to be undertaken, and certain of &s;ucce&s;s. After a deliberate examination the general judged the plan to be impracticable, but wrote to the mi|ni&s;ter that he &s;hould po&s;tpone giving a definite an|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er till he &s;hould be at Antwerp, and be able
<PB N="119" REF="026918_0117_0FD260992DD1CC20">
more particularly to examine the &s;everal parts of the project; and it was re&s;olved that the Dutch refugees &s;hould proceed to Antwerp with their revolutionary committee; and orders were given to the Dutch legion, con&s;i&s;ting nearly of 10,000 men, to garri&s;on Antwerp, and to be ready to form the advanced guard of the French army, in ca&s;e of a war with Holland.</P>
<P>An agent of Le Brun was appointed to attend the Dutch revolutionary committee; but no po&s;i|tive engagement with them was entered into, and all that related to them was rendered dependent on the i&s;&s;ue of a negociation which was then on the point of commencing.</P>
<P>At the time that Dumourier had been mini&s;ter for foreign affairs he had &s;ent to the Hague, as mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, Emanuel de Maulde, a colonel in the French army, who had conducted him&s;elf with great prudence and ability, had pro|cured arms and hor&s;es for France, and had &s;o well reconciled his attention to the intere&s;ts of the re|fugees with the re&s;pect due to the government of the country, as to acquire the confidence and e&s;teem of the two factions that divided Holland. This conduct, which was conformable to his in &s;tructions, was too moderate to be agreeable to the temper of the pre&s;ent times; and de Maulde had moreover the misfortune to be noble. Le Brun in particular conceived an aver&s;ion to him. The military committee di&s;approved of his &s;ending fu&s;ees to Dunkirk. His mea&s;ures were oppo&s;ed on every &s;ide, and his intentions calumniated. He was recalled; and in his room was appointed Noel, whom the general had made principal clerk in the office for foreign affairs. Noel, although an extremely hone&s;t man, arriving with prejudices again&s;t de Maulde and plans much le&s;s moderate than tho&s;e on which Maulde had acted, was very ill
<PB N="120" REF="026918_0118_0FD260D747F31090">
received; and, attributing his reception to de Maulde, became his enemy and accu&s;er.</P>
<P>De Maulde, on his arrival at Paris, called upon the general; and told him that, if France de&s;ired to pre&s;erve a neutrality with Holland and Eng|land, nothing was more ea&s;y; that, although the mini&s;ters of the two courts would neither acknow|ledge the National Convention, nor treat with Le Brun, yet the grand pen&s;ioner of Holland, Van Spiegel, and the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, Lord Auck|land, had charged him to declare that they would willingly treat with General Dumourier.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, Benoit, who had been agent of the French mini&s;try at London, and had ju&s;t arrived from that place, informed Le Brun on the part of Talleyrand, late Bi&s;hop of Autun, De Talon, and other French emigrants, who had po|litical connections with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, that Pitt and the council of St. James's had nothing more at heart than to treat for the pre&s;ervation of the neutrality, provided that General Dumourier &s;hould be charged with the negociation, and &s;hould proceed to England for the purpose of &s;ettling its terms, which he might ea&s;ily accompli&s;h before the opening of the campaign.</P>
<P>This overture of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try was, at fir&s;t, communicated to no other per&s;on of the execu|tive council than Garat and Le Brun. Garat, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a found judgment, zealou&s;ly embraced the offer, and proposed to &s;end the ge|neral as amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o England, without, however &s;uper&s;eding Chauvelin, with in|&s;tructions to demand a deci&s;ive an&s;wer re&s;pecting war or peace. The king's trial was not yet con|cluded, but the cruel cata&s;trophe was &s;ufficiently fore&s;een; this circum&s;tance &s;ugge&s;ted new con&s;ide|rations to Garat, who feared that the Engli&s;h court might be treacherous enough to detain Dumou|rier in England, and thereby deprive France of
<PB N="121" REF="026918_0119_0FD2609BA98EDAE0">
her be&s;t general. Dumourier was compelled to di&s;&s;emble that he al&s;o &s;aw the probability of that event, and that it was the only thing he de&s;ired. In order that he might e&s;cape from the hands of the mi&s;ereants who governed his country, he appeared to &s;ub&s;cribe to the prudence of Garat's precaution. It was however, determined that the affair &s;hould be laid before the council, and a pro|po&s;ition be made by Garat to &s;end General Dumou|rier as Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to London, in con&s;equence of the overtures made by the mini&s;|ters of England and Holland; to give the Gene|ral in&s;tructions to conduct the negociation with &s;uitable dignity and promptitude, and whatever might be the i&s;&s;ue, to return in&s;tantly to put him|&s;elf at the head of the armies. It was re&s;olved to demand from the Engli&s;h mini&s;try every po&s;&s;i|ble &s;ecurity for the per&s;on of General Dumourier, and for the full liberty of returning at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the propo&s;ition was laid before the coun|cil, Clavier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Pache and Monge oppo&s;ed it in the mo&s;t decided manner, undoubtedly incited by jea|lou&s;y and love of oppo&s;ition, for they well knew the di&s;tre&s;s of their re&s;pective departments and their incapability of &s;upporting a war that would be|come &s;o general.</P>
<P>Dumourier was extremely afflicted with the fate of a mea&s;ure which &s;eemed to have promi&s;ed his deliverance, as well as an important occa&s;ion of &s;erving his country; but he was not di&s;couraged. He was of the opinion of Garat and Le Brun that the de&s;ign &s;hould not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed any more in the council, but pro&s;ecuted &s;ecretly till it &s;hould be in a &s;tate to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. It was agreed that de Maulde &s;hould depart in&s;tantly for the Hague, under the pretence of his private concerns; that Noel &s;hould be recalled and placed el&s;ewhere; that the General &s;hould charge de Maulde with a letter for Lord Auckland, informing him that the Gene|ral
<PB N="122" REF="026918_0120_0FD260D99B693640">
would he at Antwerp on the 1&s;t of February to vi&s;it his troops in their winter quarters, and that having learnt from de Maulde, his friend, that Lord Auckland had &s;poken of him with e&s;teem and confidence, it would be a circum&s;tance of great plea&s;ure to him if an opportunity &s;hould offer of meeting that nobleman on the frontiers, and that perhaps this interview might be beneficial to the intere&s;ts of the two nations, and the cau&s;e of hu|manity. It was al&s;o determined that, &s;hould Lord Auckland receive this invitation with the good will that was to be expected, the General &s;hould give him a meeting, and might even if it was found nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;s into England.</P>
<P>It was further decided, that Maret, who had already been &s;everal times in England, &s;hould be &s;ent to London, to learn from Mr. Pitt, if he really de&s;ired to treat per&s;onally with General Dumou|rier. Chauvelin, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of France to the court of London, did not at all ac|cord with Talleyrand, who had been &s;ent with him as an adverti&s;er in his negociation, and had not at all &s;ucceeded in the object of his emba&s;&s;y, which he was ambitious of conducting without the parti|cipation of his colleague. Many indeed were the ob&s;tacles Chauvelin had to encounter; he had again&s;t him the prejudices of the Engli&s;h nation; the king of England, the mo&s;t&mdash; &mdash; <NOTE PLACE="foot">De&s;potique</NOTE>. in Europe, and the mo&s;t enraged again&s;t the French Revolu|tion; the French emigrants; the per&s;ons who had been given him as adverti&s;ers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants; the National Convention of France; and his own in|experience. It was thought nece&s;&s;ary if Dumou|rier's journey &s;hould take place to &s;acrifice Chau|velin, or rather to give him &s;ome other emba&s;&s;y; for Dumourior, who had been the intimate friend of his father, and had given him the appoint|ment
<PB N="123" REF="026918_0121_0FD2609D2F8DCC30">
to England, in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould be &s;ent to Venice or Florence, that he might continue his diplomatic career with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It appears to be but ju&s;t to &s;ay a word here of the di&s;po&s;ition that Dumourier has always di&s;played in his public character.</P>
<P>Whether it were the effect of good nature, or of a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, he has been anxious not to pre|judice the intere&s;ts of any other per&s;on in the pub|lic employment, and has obliged and &s;erved great numbers; and of cour&s;e it is not greatly &s;urpri|&s;ing, that he has met with much ingratitude.</P>
<P>Chauvelin, as it has been &s;aid, was to be recalled, and Maret was to be appointed to his &s;ituation, on the general's departure from London; &s;o that Maret was extremely intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of the negociation, and had &s;trong motives for &s;moothing the difficulties that might be in the ge|neral's way, and thereby to render his &s;tay at the court of London as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>Maret's departure was unwi&s;ely po&s;tponed, (tak|ing place only on the &s;ame day that General Du|mourier left Paris) under pretence of fir&s;t &s;ound|ing Mr. Pitt re&s;pecting the General's journey to England, by the means of one of his friends, who had already been employed in the &s;ame capacity on a former occa&s;ion by Maret. But the General had rea&s;on to believe that Le Brun, offended that the Court of St. James's would neither treat with him as mini&s;ter of foreign affairs, nor with the Conven|tion, was not &s;orry to undermine this negociation by giving &s;cope to the ra&s;h ignorance of Bri&s;&s;ot, and the folly of the diplomatic committee, who &s;eeming to think that France had not enemies enough to contend with, &s;tudied to increa&s;e the number, by in&s;ulting every nation.</P>
<P>Maret's mi&s;&s;ion was altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful. Chauvelin had never been acknowledged in Eng|land as mini&s;ter of the Republic, the Court of St. James having con&s;idered his mi&s;&s;ion at an end on the abolition of Royalty in France, and having permitted his &s;tay in London merely as an indul|gence granted to an individual. And when the news of the cruel death of Louis XVI. arrived in England, Chauvelin was ordered to quit London in four and twenty hours, and the kingdom in eight days. It was under the&s;e circum&s;tances that Maret arrived in England, and received an order from the council in&s;tantly to quit the kingdom.</P>
<P>But this reception of Maret by the Court of St. James's, did not put a &s;top to the negociation in Holland. General Dumourier departed from Paris, on the 26th of January, with a mind filled with apprehen&s;ions; he had not been able to pre|vent the commi&s;&s;ion of an unprovoked, fruitle&s;s, di&s;graceful, and fatal crime; he had not &s;ucceed|ed in procuring a revocation of the decree of the

15th December, nor in obtaining an exception in behalf of Belgium, and thereby to pre&s;erve the French army in ca&s;e of retreat; nor in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing an effective admini&s;tration for the &s;upply of arms, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &amp;c. for the army; nor in his attempts to procure the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the fortified places, reinforcements of the armies, hor&s;es for the cavalry, or any of that multitude of objects, the &s;upply of which was nece&s;&s;ary to the opening of the campaign; nor (which in every ca&s;e was the greate&s;t of his afflictions) to &s;ave an innocent king, who&s;e goodne&s;s was per&s;onally known to him. He was about to re&s;ume the com|mand of a di&s;organi&s;ed army, abandoning it&s;elf to robberies, and every &s;pecies of exce&s;s, ill arm|ed, in want of cloathing, and di&s;per&s;ed in the impoveri&s;hed villages along the Meu&s;e, and the Roer. New troops were daily arriving from Germany to augment the army of General Clair|fait, who with great capacity had made a &s;tand, and maintained him&s;elf between the Herffle and the Roer with a comparatively &s;mall number of troops, in want of every thing, and terrified at the rapacity with which the conque&s;t of Belgium had been accompli&s;hed: That general having counteracted all the ill effects of their long re|treat.</P>
<P>The Prince of Cobourg, celebrated for his glo|rious campaign again&s;t the Turks, was about to take the command of this army. In the ca&s;e of Dumourier waiting till the Prince of Cobourg &s;hould attack him, he was well a&s;&s;ured that he could not re&s;i&s;t that General in front, and, at the &s;ame time, the Prince of Hohenloe, who would at|tack him on his right flank by Namur, the citadel of which was then repairing very &s;lowly by the French; and if the Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;hould have time to a&s;&s;emble an army on his left flank, on the &s;ide of Antwerp and Dutch Flanders, even the re|treat

of Dumourier would no longer be &s;ecure, having to march through fifty leagues of &s;lat coun|try, with a di&s;orderly army, pur&s;ued and almo&s;t &s;urrounded by three armies more con&s;iderable than his own and continually a&s;&s;ailed by the Pea|&s;ants and the inhabitants or the cities, whom, the exce&s;&s;es committed by order of the Convention, had driven to de&s;peration. Deneral Dumourier, therefore had no other hope of dimini&s;hing his perplexities, but the negociation committed to the care of de Maulde. In truth, his confidence in that was con&s;iderable, &s;ince Holland had the ut|mo&s;t dread of a rupture with France, being quite unprepared for it, and having the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the pre&s;ervation of the neutrality.</P>
<P>We are about to give an account of the further circum&s;tances of this negociation, which was bro|ken off in the beginning of February, by the un|wi&s;e and haughty impetuo&s;ity of the National Con|vention. The abrupt declaration of war, made by that A&s;&s;embly again&s;t England and Holland, gave France an air of per&s;idy, re&s;pecting that negocia|tion with which the Engli&s;h have reproached them with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on; but the &s;ame charge may be retorted on the Engli&s;h, and it is probable that Pitt had no other de&s;ign than to amu&s;e General Dumourier, to gain time to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparatives for war; and the treaty entered into by the Court of St. James's with the court of Turin, at that very period, confums the opinion. So much truth is there in the ob&s;erva|tion, that hi&s;tory is but a picture of the errors and crimes of government.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fruitle&s;s Negotiations. Declaration of War.</HEAD>
<P>IMMEDIATELY on the arrival of de Maulde at the Hague, which was in the latter end of January, he pre&s;ented General Dumourier's letter to Lord Auckland, who te&s;tified the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to de Maulde on reading it, and told him that the in|tere&s;ts of England and Holland being in&s;eparable in this affair, he &s;hould communicate the propo&s;al to Van Spiegle; which was no &s;ooner done, than the latter embraced the project of a conference on the frontiers between the Amba&s;&s;ador of England, the Grand Pen&s;ioner, and General Dumourier.</P>
<P>Lord Auckland di&s;patched three packet boats, immediately &s;ucceeding each other, to his court, and dc Maulde &s;ent his &s;ecretary to Antwerp, where the General had arrived on the 2d of Fe|bruary, after having vi&s;ited the po&s;ts from Dun|kirk to Antwerp.</P>
<P>Throughout Picardy, Artois, and maritime Flanders, Dumourier found the people overwhelm|ed with terror and grief, at the tragical death of Louis XVI. The very name of Jacobin, he per|ceived, excited equal fear and horror. In all the cities, however, there were numerous emi&s;&s;aries of the Jacobins, who &s;tirred up the populace again&s;t the moderate and wi&s;e part of the citizens, and collected accu&s;ations, little regarding whether true or fal&s;e, again&s;t the different admini&s;trators of the departments.</P>
<P>At St. Omers and Dunkirk, there was not the lea&s;t appearance of preparations being made for the

war, and there were &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ely any troops to be &s;een, for the mini&s;ter of war had weakened maritime Flanders to furni&s;h the augmentation of 10,000 foot and 1500 cavalry, for the army in Au&s;trian Flanders, in con&s;equence of the General's having demanded that reinforcement. The mini&s;ter of war even drew new battalions afterwards from this country, which was part of the actual feat of the war, to form a body of 12,000 men near Cher|bourg, from whence the General had ob&s;erved a diver&s;ion might be made into England, in ca&s;e war with that power could not be avoided.</P>
<P>Nieuport and O&s;tend, were in the &s;ame condi|tion as St. Omers and Dunkirk, not having a &s;in|gle battery mounted, to prevent any ve&s;&s;els of war entering tho&s;e ports. There were not even can|non for the purpo&s;e; nor could any be obtained, without taking them from Dunkirk, which had not &s;ufficient for its own fortifications.</P>
<P>Dumourier &s;truck with the di&s;order that perva|ded the whole country, and &s;eeing that his embar|ra&s;&s;ments every moment increa&s;ed, was greatly &s;a|tisfied with the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of de Maulde's nego|ciation. He in&s;tantly di&s;patched a courier to Le Brun, with the original an&s;wer of Lord Auckland, which &s;tated that the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter and the grand Pen&s;ionary of Holland, had agreed to pro|ceed together to the frontiers to confer with the General; that Lord Auckland had &s;ent &s;everal dis|patches to his court, to obtain its &s;anction, and in|&s;tructions relative to the conference; that he &s;hould &s;oon receive an an&s;wer, and that his inten|tions were not to gain time, nor to retard the General's preparations for the campaign.</P>
<P>The di&s;patches of de Maulde, which accompa|nied tho&s;e of Lord Auckland, gave an account of the circum&s;tances of his interview with the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, and the grand Pen&s;ionary of Holland. Tho&s;e mini&s;ters, as de Maulde was prepared to
<PB N="129" REF="026918_0127_0FD260A1D85BCB48">
find, expre&s;&s;ed the utter abhorrence of the atro|cious barbarity recently committed at Paris; but as de Maulde gave them po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances that the General partook of their &s;entiments on that &s;ub|ject, and was filled with the profounde&s;t indigna|tion again&s;t the authors of the crime, that horrible affair did not retard the negociation; and it was &s;et|tled without any difficulty, that as &s;oon as Lord Auckland &s;hould have received the in&s;tructions of his court, the conference &s;hould take place at the Moor Dyke, on board a yatch belonging to the Prince of Orange, which would be prepared to re|ceive the General. De Maulde concluded by de|claring his per&s;ua&s;ion, that the conference would be attended with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The General entertained the &s;ame hopes, and had pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf the plan he thought it his duty to follow. He re&s;olved not to betray the in|tere&s;ts of his unhappy country; on the contrary, it was his intention to dimini&s;h the number of her enemies, in &s;ettling the neutrality of England and Holland on a &s;ure ba&s;is; but, after he &s;hould have rendered this la&s;t of his &s;ervices to France, he re&s;olved to free him&s;elf from the imputation of partaking in the crime of his countrymen, and no longer to fight for ab&s;urd tyrants whom he was anxious to puni&s;h, in&s;tead of aiding in the &s;upport of their hideous tyranny. He did not de&s;ign therefore to return to Antwerp but to retire to the Hague, and from thence to publi&s;h a memorial in ju&s;tification of his conduct.</P>
<P>He unfolded a part of the&s;e de&s;igns in a letter to de Maulde, which was communicated to the two mini&s;ters. They reque&s;ted leave to take a copy of it, but de Maulde declined granting that permi&s;&s;ion, being unauthori&s;ed by his friend; but at the &s;ame time he delivered Lord Auckland a letter from the General, informing that mini&s;ter that he &s;hould
<PB N="130" REF="026918_0128_0FD260DF63EF0538">
receive with great plea&s;ure news of the &s;anction of the Briti&s;h court to the&s;e mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>At the moment when the negociation was in this promi&s;ing &s;tate, while the General con&s;oled him&s;elf with the hope of being freed from the in|&s;upportable yoke of combating for tyrants, under the certainty of becoming one day the victim of their ingratitude and cruelty, whatever might be his &s;ucce&s;s; while he thus flattered him&s;elf, on the 7th of February he learnt by the public papers that the National Convention had declared war again&s;t Holland and England, on a report made by Bri&s;&s;ot in the name of the diplomatic commit|tee This news reduced him to de&s;pair, for it was altogether unexpected. He had quitted Pa|ris on the 26th of January; had arrived at An|twerp, only on the 2d of February; Le Brun, then, had not waited to receive his fir&s;t di&s;patches, nor intelligence re&s;pecting de Maulde's negocia|tion. It &s;eems that Le Brun had precipitated the report of the affront offered to the Republic in the per&s;on of Chauvelin, by order of the king of Eng|gland, to excite the anger of the thoughtle&s;s Con|vention, and thereby rai&s;e an in&s;urmountable ob|&s;tacle to the mea&s;ures he had concerted with the General.</P>
<P>As to Bri&s;&s;ot, he had, as was u&s;ual with him availed him&s;elf of this opportunity of in&s;ulting both kings and people, in which he was zealou&s;ly &s;econded by Barrere and the Jacobins. Thus the two factions united in taking a mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous &s;tep without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and without con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The war was declared, but Le Brun &s;ent no in|telligence to General Dumourier, on whom the burthen fell with the greate&s;t weight, and little en|quiry was made in the council, whether he was at all in a condition to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the&s;e new enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="026918_0129_0FD260A326F54C10">
On the day that General Dumourier, heard of the declaration of war again&s;t England and Hol|land, de Maulde arrived at Antwerp from the Hague, with a &s;econd letter from Lord Auckland, congratulating him on having received an autho|rity from his court to enter on the conference, which was fixed to commence on the 10th, at the Moor Dyke. The General in&s;tantly di&s;patched a courier informing Lord Auckland of the declara|tion of war; and ob&s;erving, that although he mu&s;t admit the declaration of war to have been a little abrupt, he mu&s;t ob&s;erve it had been occa&s;ioned by the conduct of the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try; fir&s;t, in de|taining two French ve&s;&s;els laden with corn, not|with&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the French mini&s;try to the contrary; &s;econdly, in contemptu|ou&s;ly ordering the French Amba&s;&s;ador to quit the kingdom, while a negociation was pending be|tween the two nations; and thirdly, in cau&s;ing Lord Auckland to publi&s;h, on the 2d of February, an addre&s;s to the States General, which was an in&s;ult to the French nation, and equivalent to a de|claration of war.</P>
<P>The General had al&s;o cau&s;es of complaint again&s;t the Grand Pen&s;ionary Van Spiegle. He had in vain demanded of him the liberation of Colonel Micoud, a French officer, who, after gaining a con&s;iderable law-&s;uit again&s;t a merchant in Hol|land, had been thrown into pri&s;on, through the credit of the merchant, on a vague accu&s;ation of having &s;poken too freely of the government. He had driven a troop of French comedians from Am&s;terdam without even granting them time to collect the &s;ums due to them; he had permitted Noel the French mini&s;ter at the Hague, and Thainville, his &s;ecretary, to be in&s;ulted by the emigrants, and had afterwards abruptly ordered them to quit the country; he had allowed the emigrants to appear in military uniforms at the
<PB N="132" REF="026918_0130_0FD260E0DF9B00E0">
Hague; and finally had &s;uffered the greate&s;t enmi|ty to be expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t France with impunity.</P>
<P>It is certain that the conduct of the courts of St. James's and the Hague was inexcu&s;able, &s;ince in the mid&s;t of a negociation entered into (in con&s;e|quence of overtures from them&s;elves) with Gene|ral Dumourier, whom they had demanded to con|duct the negociation, they had provoked the anger of the National Convention, whom they knew to be haughty and impatient, and incapable of a tem|perate conduct. It is but ju&s;t therefore to reproach them as well as the French with the evils re&s;ulting from this war, which is to be con&s;idered as only in its beginning, and which will be the &s;ource of other equally de&s;tructive wars.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that providence has united all the people of Europe to inflict a puni&s;hment on the enormous crimes committed by the French nation; and perhaps to puni&s;h their own errors by the calamities they will have to endure in this long, afflicting and bloody conte&s;t. The Athei&s;ts of the National Convention, and these are the mo&s;t ig|norant and wicked of the members, becau&s;e it is not through the influence of philo&s;ophy that they have become Athei&s;ts, but through the influence of their crimes, have con&s;idered what the General has &s;aid to them re&s;pecting Providence in his let|ter of the 12th of March, as an unmeaning rhap&s;ody; to &s;uch men he has to an&s;wer, that Provi|dence leaves us free to make a virtuous or vicious choice, but that from the fir&s;t choice nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ults the character of our actions, good or bad; that which is ju&s;t is alone true; that which is un|ju&s;t is the effect of error in the mind; that this is above all true with re&s;pect to governments; and that ju&s;tice conducts nations to happine&s;s, and in|ju&s;tice to mi&s;ery: that when a nation is univer&s;ally infected with a licentious &s;pirit, as is the ca&s;e with France, all her motives and actions tend to her
<PB N="133" REF="026918_0131_0FD260A9A1312970">
ruin; hence the &s;ame phrenzy which induced France to commit the fruitle&s;s crime of murdering Louis XVI. and of treating his family as a herd of &s;laves, dictated the decree of the 15th of Decem|ber, which is equally devoid of ju&s;tice and policy, which has lo&s;t the nation the good-will of every people who were attached to her, has infu&s;ed di|vi&s;ions into her councils, familiari&s;ed her with ac|cu&s;ations, robberies, and ma&s;&s;acres, has begotten her filthine&s;s and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of manners; her wan|tonne&s;s in creating of enemies, and indifference to the means of re&s;i&s;ting them; and in fine her anar|chy and total want of order, which has already in|flicted upon her the fir&s;t puni&s;hments of that long &s;eries that awaits her. For from the moment that France became a Republic, &s;he degenerated into the mo&s;t unfortunate country that the annals of the world have produced.</P>
<P>We will conclude this book with a melancholy reflection on the condition to which France has reduced her&s;elf by her errors; &s;he had been pre&s;ented with a con&s;titution formed in a &s;hort and difficult period by her fir&s;t legi&s;lature, which was not indeed perfect but highly valuable, and which every people of Europe admired and envied. The two factions that exi&s;ted in France, in combating each other, neverthele&s;s were of one mind to de|&s;troy this con&s;titution. The court hoped to re|cover its former power and numerous means of gratifications; and the Jacobins entirely to beat down royalty, which they hated, but which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of Frenchmen; and while the con&s;titution was a theme of prai&s;e with all rea&s;onable men in other parts of Europe, the French blamed, &s;purned and rejected it. But the merits of the con&s;titution were unknown to the people of France, for they never permitted them|&s;elves to judge of it but through the medium of their furious pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Plan of the Campaign.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now entering upon the hi&s;tory of a campaign more rapid, more varied, and perhaps more important, in its events, than any of former or later times. The nature of the campaign was not fore&s;een till the fir&s;t week of February; the plan was conceived and arranged be|tween the 7th and the 22d of that month; and the cam|paign fini&s;hed on the 5th of the following April.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this &s;hort period, offers, to the contem|plation of the military man, Cities taken in defiance of of immen&s;e innundations, a great battle, a variety of en|gagements, and a retreat which excited the a&s;toni&s;hment of the generals of the enemy, aad from which they could not withhold their prai&s;e: It exhibits an example of the two &s;pecies of war, the offen&s;ive, and defen&s;ive: And it may be &s;aid to have involved con&s;equences that will decide the fate of France, and perhaps that of Europe.</P>
<P>Nor is this hi&s;tory le&s;s intere&s;ting to the philo&s;opher, whom it will confirm in the opinion, that the de&s;tiny of empires is often dependent on circum&s;tances that are apparently incon&s;iderable; and that the character and fortune of one man may decide the fate of a nation. In the preceding year, General Dumourier had pre&s;erved
<PB N="142" REF="026918_0136_0FD260E85706CE50">
the independence of France, by his &s;ucce&s;s in the plains of Champagne, and rendered her name illu&s;trious in tho&s;e of Belgium: for, at that period, the greatne&s;s of the danger which threatened France united all minds under his &s;tandard, and compelled the nation to di&s;play her energy under the direction of his coun&s;els. In the pe|riod we are now con&s;idering, the &s;ituation and character of the French people were changed. The nation or rather tho&s;e who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overned and mi&s;led the nation, intox|icated with &s;ucce&s;s, and blinded by their crimes, no lon|ger li&s;tened to the general, who would now have &s;aved his countrymen, both from a foreign yoke, and from the tyranny of their own mi&s;taken pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>He was not &s;econded in his efforts. He was not obey|ed. He was oppo&s;ed, and betrayed; and his cam|paign was unfortunate, notwith&s;tanding his exertions to turn the fortune of war in his favour. On the point of conquering Holland, the conque&s;t was &s;natched from his hands. He formed a &s;econd plan, and victory was torn from him by his own troops. In the mid&s;t of a retreat, that was as &s;ucce&s;sfully conducted as it was bloody and de&s;tructive, he projected another de&s;ign, which pre&s;erv|ed his army, and arre&s;ted the ruin of Belgium, which, otherwi&s;e, would have been complete. But this de&s;ign fell &s;hort of its greate&s;t object, the deliverance of France: and, in that, it was defeated by the fierce pride of the con|vention, and by the ficklene&s;s of his troops; and Gene|ral Dumourier was compelled to quit his army, and to &s;eek a retreat among &s;trangers, who could not forbear to e&s;teem him.</P>
<P>Thenceforth, the French were no longer the &s;ame people. In the &s;oldiery, &s;avage rage &s;ucceeded valour; there was neither talent in the plan of the war, nor conduct in its execution; the French &s;lew and were &s;lain, without remor&s;e, or con&s;ideration. It was not war that they carried on; and the carnage would already have been terminated, if the force that oppo&s;ed them were that of a &s;ingle people, or were not rendered inef|fectual by the cla&s;hing of various intere&s;ts and coun&s;els.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of General Dumourier was embarra&s;&s;ing, when he knew that England and Holland were on the point of adding their forces to tho&s;e of the other enemies of France. If the per&s;ons who were at the head of affairs, had been well informed and prudent men, he direct|ly would have advi&s;ed them to evacuate the Netherlands
<PB N="143" REF="026918_0137_0FD260B13098CFA8">
which could no longer be pre&s;erved; and to po&s;t the troops behind the fortified places of the north, holding for a while the banks of the Scheld, and the citadel of Namur. But this rea&s;onable propo&s;ition would have been regarded as proceeding from cowardice or treachery; and would have brought the general to the &s;caffold. Or, if it had been accepted, it would have delivered the General into the hands of tyrants whom it was his object to cru&s;h for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of his country. Entering France with an enemy in pur&s;uit of him, and with the appearance of a &s;light, he would have in&s;tantly lo&s;t his military reputation, which was only to be pre&s;erved by &s;ingle &s;ucce&s;&s;es; and his fate would have been at the di&s;po&s;al of the Jacobins of Paris, whom this retreat would have reinforced with the whole amount of his army. He could not therefore extricate him&s;elf from this de&s;perate &s;ituation, but by the hardie&s;t and mo&s;t de|ci&s;ive means. His military fame and the celerity of his movements, could alone open him the way to the &s;upply of all that was wanting to his army. Clothing, accou|trements, hor&s;es, arms, provi&s;ions, money, all were to be found in Holland; and there, he was compelled to &s;eek them. He conceived the de&s;ign of conquering Holland by a daring blow; and we will now rapidly re|view his plan, and his re&s;ources.</P>
<P>The Dutch refugees had formed a &s;mall revolutionary committee at Antwerp, where was al&s;o the Dutch legion. The committee po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more zeal than ability; and, although they expended con&s;iderable &s;ums of money in maintaining a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the different Provinces of the Dutch Republic, the information which the general received through their means was extremely deficient, e&s;pecially re&s;pecting the military &s;tate of that country. All that could be relied on with certainty was, that the party of the patriots was very con&s;iderable: particularly at Am&s;terdam, Haerlem, Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and through|out Zealand. The general pretended to rea&s;&s;ume the con&s;ideration of the plan, which the committee had laid before him at Paris, of making an irruption into Zealand. He affected to examine it minutely in pre&s;ence of the committee, and feigned to give it his approbation; in order to cover a plan more bold in appearance, but in truth more certain of &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e it appeared to be more impracticable. He did not di&s;clo&s;e that de&s;ign to any other per&s;ons than to Mr. Koch and Mr. De Ni&s;s,
<PB N="144" REF="026918_0138_0FD260EA38677FB8">
whom he thought de&s;erving of his entire confidence; and who&s;e zeal, probity, &s;trength of mind, and love of their country, entitled them to be the deliverers of their fel|low citizens.</P>
<P>The plan for the inva&s;ion of Zealand, was as follows: The refugees had learnt that the Stadtholder had formed the de&s;ign of fortifying the I&s;land of Walcheren, as a place of retreat for the States General and the members of the government, in ca&s;e the French &s;hould enter the country, and &s;hould be joined by the people, whom the government mi&s;tru&s;ted. The Dutch Committee propo&s;ed that a co&s;iderable body of men &s;hould depart from Ant|werp, and proceed, with as great &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch as po&s;&s;ible, by Sand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liet to the i&s;land of South Beveland, and from thence to the i&s;land of Walcheren, and, &s;eizing upon Middleburg and Flu&s;hing, &s;hould make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that latter i&s;land. The garri&s;ons of tho&s;e two towns, it is true, did not amount to more than twelve or fifteen hundred men, and were raw and undi&s;ciplined troops. But if the inhabitants had not joined their deli|verers, the French &s;oldiers would infallibly have been cut off. There was nothing to prevent the i&s;land receiv|ing &s;uccours to double the amount of the French detach|ment; there were already &s;everal Engli&s;h frigates at Flu&s;hing; and the Dutch had a &s;quadron of armed ve&s;&s;els in the Scheld, lying under the fortre&s;s of Batz, a league below Lillo, which would entirely have cut off the retreat of the detachment to the main land.</P>
<P>No &s;ucce&s;s could be expected in this expedition, with|out &s;uch promptitude and exactne&s;s in the execution, as the general could not expect either from his own troops, or tho&s;e of the Dutch patriots. He had not a &s;ingle general officer under his command to whom he could confide &s;o dangerous an enterprize. He could not aban|don the command of the main army, to undertake the ex|pedition him&s;elf. Had he yielded to the opinion of the Dutch patriots, he would certainly have been led into an un&s;ucce&s;sful enterprize; and this unfortunate check in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beginning of the campaign would have completed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he rein of his &s;mall army, con&s;i&s;ting of new troops, that had already &s;uffered much by his ab&s;ence, and were &s;hortly after beaten, di&s;couraged, and almo&s;t di&s;per&s;ed on the Roer and the Meu&s;e.</P>
<P>But if, by the chance that belongs to military move|ments, this expedition had been &s;ucce&s;sful, however bril|liant
<PB N="145" REF="026918_0139_0FD260B235C83428">
it might have been, it would have produced no real benefit to the general. On the contrary, it would have deprived him of five or &s;ix thou&s;and of his troops, who, would have been &s;eparated from him by an arm of the &s;ea, and all the places of Dutch Flanders: leaving him with|out a force &s;ufficient to undertake any thing further.</P>
<P>The better to conceal his real de&s;igns, however, he profe&s;&s;ed to adopt that plan of attacking Holland, and he made &s;ome dipo&s;itions as if he was about to undertake it &s;eriou&s;ly. He had, at Antwerp, &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els under the command of Captain Moult&s;on, an American officer in the French &s;ervice, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the tak|ing of the citadel of Antwerp. This &s;mall &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted of the Ariel of 24 guns, a brig of 14 guns, and three gun|boats. He ordered the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to be fitted out, to pro|ceed to fort Lillo, and there to ca&s;t anchor. He directed a furnace to be con&s;tructed on each of the gun-boats, for the purpo&s;e of heating balls. He commanded the &s;ort of Lillo, and that of Liefken&s;hoeck, and the citadel of Ant|werp, to be furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions, and put in a &s;tate to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege. He a&s;&s;embled, at Antwerp, all the Dutch ve&s;&s;els that on the declaration of war had been detained in the canals of the Scheldt, and ordered them to be prepared to &s;erve as fire-&s;hips.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed it to be believed that his object was to burn the Dutch ve&s;&s;els lying at anchor under the fort of Batz; and to &s;eize upon that fort, which mounted forty guns. The Dutch ve&s;&s;els retired to Ramekens. In &s;hort, every thing &s;eemed to indicate, during &s;everal days, that the general's movements were directed again&s;t Zealand; and he gave the enemy rea&s;on to imagine that the campaign would open by the inva&s;ion of that country. Mean|while, the general's thoughts were wholly occupied with his own plan; which was extremely &s;imple, although, had it never been attempted it mu&s;t have appeared wholly impracticable. This plan was, to make his way with a body of troops to the Moordyke, deceiving and evading the garri&s;ons of Breda, and Gertruydenburg, on his right; Bergen-up-Zoom, Steenburg, Klundert, and William&s;tadt, on his left: and, pa&s;&s;ing the arm of the &s;ea which runs between the Moor-dyke and Dort, and which is about two leagues in breadth, to land at Dort: where being arrived he &s;hould be in the heart of Holland, and would have no ob&s;tacles to encounter in marching by
<PB N="146" REF="026918_0140_0FD260EBF930DA98">
Rotterdam, Delft, the Hague, Leyden and Haerlem, to Am&s;terdam. By this plan, he would take all the &s;trong places of Holland in the rear. Meanwhile, General Miranda, with a detachment of the grand army, was to bombard Mae&s;tricht, and Venloo; and, as &s;oon as he &s;hould know that General Dumourier had reached Dort, he was to leave General Valence to continue the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht, and to march with 25,000 men again&s;t Nimeguen, where General Dumourier was to join him by the route of Utrecht.</P>
<P>This plan, executed with rapidity, would have had little &s;erious dfficulty to encouter, &s;ince the Stadtholder neither had an army a&s;&s;embled, nor had adopted any &s;et|tled plan of defence; and &s;ince, of all the enterprizes that might be undertaken by Dumourier, this was the lea&s;t to be expected: for it &s;eemed to be no better than an attempt to march an army <HI>through the eye of a needle</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">The&s;e are the words of Dumourier</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dmourier's next de&s;ign was, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be ma&s;ter of Holland, to &s;end the battalions of national guards back into Belgium; to a&s;&s;emble an army entirely com|po&s;ed of troops of the line, and commanded by generals of who&s;e fidelity he was a&s;&s;ured, and to compel the States General of the United Provinces, to order a &s;ur|render of all their towns: to make no changes in the govern|ment, but &s;uch as &s;hould be indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; to di&s;&s;olve the Dutch Revolutionary Committee, to the members of which he had already &s;ignified that in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, they might be &s;everally appointed to the public &s;ituations of their re&s;pective Provinces, &s;uppo&s;ing them to po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence of their fellow citizens; to pre|&s;erve the Dutch Republic from the tyranny of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the national convention, and from the in|fluence of Jacobini&s;m; to fit out a fleet with all po&s;&s;ible expedition at Rotterdam, in Zealand, and in the Texel, in order to &s;eize upon the Dutch &s;ettlements in India, and to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them by &s;trong garri&s;ons; to offer a perfect neutrality to the Engli&s;h; to &s;tation, in the conntry of Zutphen and Dutch Guelders, an army of ob&s;ervation con&s;i&s;ting of 30,000 men; to furni&s;h money and arms for the rai&s;ing a body of 30,000 men, in the countries of Antwerp, the two Flanders, and Campine, on who&s;e attachment he could rely; to permit the French
<PB N="147" REF="026918_0141_0FD260B82E35AA88">
to occupy no other part of the Netherlands, than the country of Liege; to annul, throughout Belgium the decre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the 15 of December; to invite the people of that coun|try to a&s;&s;emble at Alo&s;t, Antwerp, or Ghent, for the pur|po&s;e of forming on a &s;olid ba&s;is &s;uch a government as &s;hould be agreeable to them; and after that to a&s;&s;emble an army of Belgians of 40,000 men, compo&s;ed of battalions of 800 men each, together with a body of cavalry. Dumou|rier further de&s;igned to offer a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms to the Im|periali&s;ts; and in ca&s;e of its being rejected, to rai&s;e an army of 150,000 men in order to drive them beyond the Rhine; but if it were accepted he hoped to gain time and means to execute the re&s;t of his plan, which was, either to form a Republic of the eighteen Provinces of the Netherlands, if that &s;hould be agreeable to the people, or to make an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance between the Republic of the Seven United Provinces and that of Belgium, and to rai&s;e an army of 80,000 men in the two countries for their joint defence, till the conclu&s;ion of the war; to invite France to enter into an alliance with the two Republics, and to put an end to her anarchy by re-adopt|ing the con&s;titution of 1789; and in ca&s;e of France refu|&s;ing to accede to this propo&s;al, to march to Paris with an army compo&s;ed of the French troops of the line, and a body of 40,000 Dutch and Belgians, in order to di&s;&s;olve the National Convention, and annihilate the power of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>Such were the outlines of General Dumourier's plan, which was communicated only to four per&s;ons. It will appear vi&s;ionary to the reader; but being founded on the circum&s;tances of the times, and on well combined calcu|lations, it could not have failed of &s;ucce&s;s, if the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous events, entirely unconnected with the conduct and arrangements of General Dumourier, had not broken all his mea&s;ures, and forced him to &s;acrifice all his hopes to the immediate &s;afety of the grand army, on the point of being entirely de&s;troyed, by the mi&s;management of the officers who commanded under him.</P>

<P>GENERAL DUMOURIER, having taken his re&s;o|lution, may be &s;till &s;aid to have had all his means to create. At Antwerp, there were two battalions of national gendarmerie, con&s;i&s;ting of 350 men each, who were dangerous only to their officers and the peaceable inhabitants of the city, being the mo&s;t dete&s;table and undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiers that ever entered the field of battle. The&s;e ferocious Jani&s;&s;aries received each 40 &s;ols per day in &s;pecie without deduction; appointed their own officers; and comitted every kind of crime. The general, after pa&s;&s;ing them in review, declared in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that, &s;hould they continue to commit the exce&s;&s;es of which they were accu&s;ed, or to be guilty of any di&s;obe|dience of orders, he would in&s;tantly &s;end them back to France. This body of gendarmerie was compo&s;ed of the ancient French guards. There were al&s;o, at Ant|werp, one hundred and fifty dragoons of the 20th regi|ment; three battalions of national guards; and about two thou&s;and of the Dutch legion, two hundred of which were hor&s;e. Twelve battalions of national guards, newly rai&s;ed, and having neither fu&s;ees, accoutrements, nor &s;hoes, were quartered in the cities and villages of We&s;t Flanders; and had no idea that they &s;hould be obliged to take the field till the month of May.</P>
<P>Cannon, mortars, magazines, money, commi&s;&s;aries, together with their a&s;&s;i&s;tants, were altogether wanting. But there was not a moment to be lo&s;t. The ra&s;hne&s;s of the national convention, in declaring war again&s;t Holland, had warned the Dutch to prepare for their defence; and, unle&s;s the general had attacked them with the utmo&s;t celerity, the enterprize would have become uterly chi|merical. And, indeed, had the Dutch prepared for their defence with as great activity as the general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed for attacking them, the project mu&s;t have been un&s;ucce&s;s|ful.</P>

General Miranda had remained at the head of the army of the North during the whole winter. This general was a Peruvian by birth; and was a man o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> capacity, and exten&s;ive information. He was bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ver&s;ed in the theory of war t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">my other of the Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> generals, but he was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly well ver&s;ed in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> practice. His intimacy with Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> had been the cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of his entering the &s;ervice the preceding year, as major general. He joined Dumourier at the camp of Grand|pre; and had been of great &s;ervice to him, in the differ|ent attacks of the Pru&s;&s;ians, particularly in the retreat of the 15th of September. But he had a haughtine&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and a bluntne&s;s of manner, which begat him many enemies; and he was unfit to command the French, who&s;e confidence it is impo&s;&s;ible to gain but by good humour and a conduct expre&s;&s;ive of re&s;pect for them.</P>
<P>Dumourier had procured him the appointment of lieutenant-general, in the month of November 1792; had conferred upon him the command of the army of the North, and had promi&s;ed to obtain him the rank of gene|ral, on the fir&s;t opportunity. Miranda was afterward offended that Valence, an older lieutenant-general than him&s;elf, (having commanded with great reputation gene|ral Kellermann's advanced guard, and &s;everal detached corps, during the campaign of 1792) &s;hould have been rai&s;ed to the rank of general on the recommendation of Dumourier. He never forgave this preference; but his re&s;entment, unfortunately for France, did not di&s;play it&s;elf till the day of the battle of Nerwinde. At the time we now &s;peak of, he &s;till appeared full of attachment to Dumourier. And that general had written to him from Paris to make preparations for the opening of the cam|paign, very early in the &s;pring, by the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht, in ca&s;e a rupture &s;hould prove to be unavoidable with England and Holland.</P>
<P>Dumourier's own army was then under the command of general Lanoue, who was a very brave and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;t man. Fifty years pa&s;t in the &s;ervice had rendered him re&s;pectable; but had al&s;o dimini&s;hed his vigour. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by general Thouvenot, an officer of very uncommon merit.</P>
<P>The army of general Valence was commanded, in his ab&s;ence by lieutenant-general Le Veneur, a man of great courage but of a limited capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="026918_0144_0FD260EFD025BE48">
Dumourier ordered General Miranda to pre&s;ent him|&s;elf before Mae&s;tricht with a part of his army, without too much weakening the po&s;ts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Meu&s;e; to reinforce him&s;elf to the number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> men drawn from the other two armies; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the&s;e orders to the re&s;pective generals, that they might contract their lines, and hold their troops in readine&s;s to take t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> field, if the Imperiali&s;ts, who&s;e numbers were daily increa&s;ing in their quarters, on the Her&s;tle, and the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ru&s;&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns who were al&s;o daily receiving reinforcements at We&s;&s;el, &s;hould betray any de&s;igns of forming a junction to relieve Mae&s;tricht, which was expected. General Dumourier thought it prudent not to point out the po&s;ition that might be proper for this army of ob&s;ervation; and he acknow|ledges that, in this, he committed a great error.</P>
<P>In the remaining part of General Dumourier's in&s;truc|tions to Miranda, he confidentially unfolded his plan for attacking Holland. He de&s;ired him not to open the &s;iege regularly before Mae&s;tricht, being too early in the &s;ea&s;on for &s;uch an undertaking, but to endeavour to carry the place by a vigorous a&s;&s;ault with bombs and red hot balls, in the &s;ame manner as the Duke of Saxe-Te&s;chen had attempted to carry Li&s;le; and, when General Dumourier &s;hould have informed him that he had reached Dort by the Moor Dyke, to leave General Valence before Mae&s;tricht, and to proceed by forced marches to Nime|guen, pa&s;&s;ing by the frontier of the Dutchy of Cleves, in order to intercept the Pru&s;&s;ians, if they &s;hould attempt to reach Hollands before him: and to this latter purpo&s;e, Dumourier de&s;ired him to &s;end General Champmorin (a mo&s;t able engineer) again&s;t Venloo, while Miranda &s;hould be&s;iege Mae&s;tricht, and by that means to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the lower part of the Meu&s;e as far as Genep.</P>
<P>General Dumourier confined the number of men that Miranda &s;hould employ in this expedition to 25,000 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000, at the utmo&s;t, that he might not too much weaken the po&s;ts on the Meu&s;e, He recommended the greate&s;t di&s;patch in the preparations, &s;o that Mae&s;tricht might be inve&s;ted by the 12th or 15th of that month; and he appointed lieutenant-general Bouchet, an experienced engineer, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Miranda in the &s;iege.</P>
<P>Dumourier wrote nearly in the &s;ame terms to Lanoue and Thouvenot; enjoining them to inform the troops, that he &s;hould review them, after having vi&s;ited the
<PB N="151" REF="026918_0145_0FD260BB367D3030">
quarters on the lower Meu&s;e. He wrote to lieutenant-|general Moreton, who commanded in Bru&s;&s;els, that he was &s;etting off immediately for that city. And to General d'Harville, ordering him to a&s;&s;emble his troops at Namur on the 20th of February, as he de&s;igned to review his divi&s;ion on the 22d of that month. Thus, in mi&s;leading &s;uch of his generals as were not to be employ|ed in the expedition he effectually deceived the enemy, who were utterly at a lo&s;s to conjecture in what point he would begin the campaign.</P>
<P>Some days after General Dumourier quitted Paris, Pache re&s;igned the war departmemt in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be cho&s;en Mayor of Paris, and was &s;ucceeded by General Bour|nonville, for whom Dumourier had procured the rank of lieutenant-general and afterward of general in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time. Dumourier had been u&s;ed to call him his Ajax and his &s;on. In truth he had commenced his career with great &s;pirit, and had evinced a &s;incere attachment to the general. Dumourier now informed him merely, that it was his de&s;ign to attack Holland, without entering into any detail of his plan, le&s;t he &s;hould be betrayed by the indi&s;cretion or the di&s;hone&s;ty of the clerks of the war office.</P>
<P>Pache, a little while before his quitting the mini&s;try, had ordered the demolition of the &s;mall part of the fortifi|cations of Mons and Tournay which then remained. The&s;e imprudent orders had di&s;gu&s;ted the inhabitants of tho&s;e two cities. General Dumourier &s;u&s;pended the execution of the order; and, he not only de&s;ired the new mini&s;ter of war to revoke it, but &s;trongly recom|mended to him to repair the fortifications of tho&s;e two places, with the utmo&s;t di&s;pach. He al&s;o coun&s;elled him to fortify with equal &s;peed the &s;trong place of the ca&s;tle of Huy; to make ditches round Malines, which might ea&s;ily be put in a &s;tate of defence by inundations; to erect &s;trong batteries at O&s;tend, Nieuport, and Dun|kirk, in order to &s;trengthen our frontiers on that &s;ide, in the probable ca&s;e of our being obliged to evacuate Belgium. General Dumourier further advi&s;ed Burnon|ville to complete the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ines from Dunkirk to Bergues; to form an intrenched camp at Mount Ca&s;&s;ell; and to fortify Orchies between Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, Douay, and Conde; Bavay, as an out-po&s;t to Que&s;noy, between Conde and Maubege; and Beaumon between Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bege and Phill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ville.</P>

Such were the coun&s;els re&s;pecting fortifying that fron|tier which were given by General Dumourier, although he is a cu&s;ed of having betrayed his country. General Dumourier faithfully &s;erved his country till the moment that he quitted her; and he will again &s;erve her; with the &s;ame zeal and fidelity, if he &s;hould ever &s;ee her governed by a king, under the &s;anc|tion of a con&s;titution. Had his coun&s;els been followed, the combined armies would have been detained longer on the exterior frontier, by that line of po&s;ts and would not, have penetrated &s;o ea&s;ily into France.</P>
<P>General Dumourier al&s;o reque&s;ted Bournonville to &s;end him reinforcements of men, and to order General D'Ar|con to join him, with &s;ome able engineers, having to make a campaign that would abound in &s;ieges. Bournon|ville acceded to all Dumourier's reque&s;ts, as far as was in his power, with promptitude; and General D'Arcon arrived at the army immediately afterward.</P>
<P>This general, although one of the be&s;t engineers and one of the worthie&s;t men in France, had been accu&s;ed of ari&s;tocracy by the well known Prince of He&s;&s;e, a con|temptible Jacobin; and had been deprived of his com|mand; but General Dumourier, who had been long ac|quainted with his merit, re&s;tored him to the &s;ervice of his country, and found him worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>General de Flers commanded at Bruges. He was a brave man; but was opinionated, and did not po&s;&s;e&s;s much capacity. Having received a wound with a mu&s;|ket ball in the camp of Maulde, Dumourier made him major-general; and afterwards &s;ent him to Bruges, to take upon him the command in We&s;t Flanders, and had given him orders to receive the reinforcement of 10,000 men, which Pache had marched into that country on the General's reque&s;t.</P>
<P>When Dumourier arrived at Bruges, de Flers laid be|fore him a plan which he had formed for &s;urpri&s;ing the city of Sluys. The general pretended to adopt the plan; and &s;ent de Flers to Bournonville, with a reque&s;t to give de Flers a body of 5 or 6000 men and &s;mall train of artillery, to enable him to menace Dutch Flanders. The request was complied with, &s;peedily and compleatly.</P>
<P>The general had no de&s;ign that de Flers &s;hould attack the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h towns in Flanders, which it was not po&s;&s;ile for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to take; but he placed this &s;mall body of men under
<PB N="153" REF="026918_0147_0FD261258C444DF8">
his orders, to be ready to replace, on the &s;ide of Antwerp and Breda, the forces that the general &s;hould march into Holland. And he knew that the a&s;&s;embling this &s;mall army in the neighbourhood of Bruges would &s;till aid in deceiving the Dutch re&s;pecting the general's de&s;igns, e&s;|pecially as de Flers was him&s;elf deceived, and made &s;eri|ous preparations for his expedition.</P>
<P>General Dumourier had left all the officers of his &s;taff at Liege, together with his aids de camp, and was accom|panied by his faithful Bapti&s;te. He had al&s;o left his equipage with the grand army, to favour the opinion that he de&s;igned to return; and had only ordered a few hor&s;es to attend him at Antwerp, under pretence of vi&s;iting the cantonments on the Meu&s;e. To form his &s;taff therefore, he &s;ent for four of his officers, at the head of whom he placed Colonel Thouvenot, brother to the general of the &s;ame name. This officer, who, under every circum&s;tance, has been the zealous friend of General Dumourier, abounded in courage, information, and re&s;ources of mind. He was in an an eminent degree important to the gene|ral during the campaign in Holland; and when they quitted the army together rendered the general every &s;er|vice in his power.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of General Thouvenot was nece&s;&s;ary to the grand army. He was the only officer that perfectly under&s;tood the details of duty in winter quarters; and was the only one that had influence enough to heal the fre|quent quarrels that happened among the generals. It was known that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the entire confidence of Dumou|rier, and al&s;o that his merit entitled him to that confi|dence; and although he was not the better beloved on that account, it obtained him a greater degree of re&s;pect; and, it being known that he was perfectly acquainted with the general's intentions, his opinion was received with the &s;ame deference that was paid to the general's orders.</P>
<P>There was no other commi&s;&s;ary with the army, than Petit-Jean, to provide magazines and every thing nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht, and for the cantonments between the Meu&s;e and the Roer, and the different quar|ters in Belgium. It &s;eemed imprudent to take him a mo|ment from the&s;e multiplied concerns, before the arrival of Malus, who was &s;till detained at Paris, although a pro|mi&s;e had been made to the general that he &s;hould be &s;ent to the army.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="026918_0148_0FD260F2ADBB5A08">
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;ons, Dumourier ordered General Thouvenot and Petit-Jean to attend him at Ant|werp; and, in two days, he &s;ettled with them all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary engagements to enable his troops to take the field for the expedition.</P>
<P>Dumourier at the &s;ame time &s;ent to Liege for General La Fayette, and Lieutenant-Colonel La Martiniere, to form his train of artillery, which indeed was very in|con&s;iderable. The&s;e two officers &s;erved him with a zeal and knowledge de&s;erving of the highe&s;t eulogiums.</P>
<P>On the departure of Thouvenot and Petit Jean, Gene|ral Dumourier gave them in&s;tructions for a new levy of twenty-five battalions of Belgians, con&s;i&s;ting of, 800 men each, and he charged the generals and other officers commanding in the different provinces with the execu|tion of the&s;e order, and appointed Thouvenot in&s;pector general and Petit Jean commi&s;&s;ary general; in pur&s;u|ance of a decree of the National Convention, which pla|ced tho&s;e troops on the footing of French &s;oldiers. Till that period, the Belgic Provinces had made levies of le|gions, regiments, and corps at their plea&s;ure. The&s;e troops were filled with a di&s;proportionate number of of|ficers, and were paid on the credit of the Belgic military committee, the members of which were very ignorant and di&s;hone&s;t, and were governed by General Roziere, who had formerly been an officer in the &s;ervice of France, and was neither a man of honour nor talents.</P>
<P>General Valence, on his route from Paris, pa&s;&s;ed thro Antwerp to take Dumourier's orders, Dumourier com|municated his entire plan to Valence; and informed him that he was to cover the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht, with the ar|my under his command, till Miranda &s;hould depart for Nimeguen, afterward to continue the &s;iege, if the town &s;hould not be then taken. He recommended to the ge|neral to vi&s;it all the winter quarters of the army, to choo&s;e a proper po&s;ition for the covering army, to watch the motions of the enemy, and to hold him&s;elf ready to engage them if they &s;hould endeavour to relieve Mae|&s;tricht, which was rea&s;onably to be expected. Above all things, he recommended to him to act with promptne&s;s and vigour; to concert mea&s;ures &s;incerely and cordia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> General Miranda; and to con&s;ult General Thouvenot, who&s;e knowledge could not fail to be of infinite &s;ervice to him. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent orders to Lanoue to obey General Valence.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="026918_0149_0FD26126DE71AF98">
The Committee of Finance of the Convention, mi&s;|tru&s;ting the general, or being de&s;irous of counteracting and in&s;ulting them had ordered the trea&s;ury to fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;h no more money to the troops than their pay, and not to appropriate &s;ums for the other expences, although the troops were in want of &s;hoes, cloaths and arms.

The expedition however was attended with prodigious incidental expences.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the rapacity and unju&s;t conduct of the French in Belgium, the whole of that nation rendered ju&s;tice to the conduct of General Dumourier. In no city of Europe are there a greater number of wealthy inhabi|tants than at Antwerp. After the commerce of that city had fallen into decay, the inhabitants had &s;ub&s;tituted the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy in the place of that re&s;ource. Their expences were u&s;ually confined within the bounds of a part of their revenues, &s;o that their fortunes could not but accumulate greatly. General Dumourier a&s;&s;embled the magi&s;trates and principal citizens, and opened a loan of 1,200,000 &s;lorins. A merchant named Verbrouck was charged with the receipt of the money, and the commi&s;|&s;ary Petit-Jean with the &s;uperintendance of its expendi|ture. The loan produced 200,000 florins, which in the end was an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;timable re&s;ource. It &s;erved to cloath and arm the legion of the North, the hu&s;&s;ars of the Republic, and &s;everal other French and Belgic corps. General Dumourier, who never had lei&s;ure even to examine the accounts of the expenditure, and who was in Holland while it was received and expended, has been calumnia|ted on this ground al&s;o. He was charged in the Jacobin Society, and afterward in the Convention, with having ap|propriated this &s;um to his own u&s;e. But he who&s;e mind is occupied with great and intere&s;ting concerns, is not liable to be greatly tempted by the love of wealth.</P>
<P>General Dumourier, before he entered Holland, pub|li&s;hed a mani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;to, with which the Hou&s;e of Orange has been ju&s;tly offended.

But it would be a wrong

done to General Dumourier, to impute to his moral cha|racter, actions that were impo&s;ed upon him by his public &s;ituation.&mdash;He was called upon to give encourage|ment to a very con&s;iderable party in the Dutch nation, who were di&s;pirited by former misfortunes; and to terrify the partizans of the Stadtholder.&mdash;It became him, in the &s;tation he filled, to &s;eparate the people of Holland from the cau&s;e of the Stadtholder, &s;ince the Dutch nation, had it been left to her to determine, would have avoided the war, dreading it as altogether contrary to her intere&s;ts. Dumourier's declaration re&s;ulted from the&s;e circum&s;tances; and be&s;ide, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;creen the general from the cen&s;ure and re&s;entment of the National Convention, till he &s;hould be able to pene|trate with &s;ucce&s;s into Holland.</P>
<P>The preparations of which we have &s;poken were made, and the army a&s;&s;embled with every nece&s;&s;ary, in ten days; and the advanced guard entered Holland, on the 17th of February. The mo&s;t important difficulty was, to con|ceal the incon&s;iderable amount of this &s;mall army. And, in that, the general &s;ucceeded &s;o perfectly, that the troops them&s;elves were per&s;uaded that they were not le&s;s thay 30,000 &s;trong; while the Dutch imagined they had to contend with an immen&s;e army; in which opinion, they were confirmed by the inhabitants of Antwerp, who extremely exaggerated the number of troops, which pa&s;&s;ed through that city.</P>

<P>THE greater part of the army entered the Dutch territories on the 17th of February, and were &s;tationed in cantonments, clo&s;ely connected with each other, and extending from Bergen-op-Zoom, to within a league of Breda. The artillery was not yet ready; and the ge|neral, having various orders to give relative to his ex|pedition, to the army of the Meu&s;e, and the affairs of Belgium, was detained at Antwerp till the 22d, when he departed with the artillery and the remainder of the troops.</P>
<P>The army was compo&s;ed of twenty-one battalions, be&s;ide the cavalry and light troops. The&s;e twenty-one battalions, if complete, would have amounted to near 14,000 men; but there were not above 10,000 under arms. Of the&s;e, there were only two battalions that were troops of the line, the 20th regiment formerly the regiment of Conti, which had never &s;een any &s;ervice, and the National gendarmerie.</P>
<P>Three battalions of the volunteers had &s;erved in the preceding campaign in Flanders. The re&s;t were new levies, the greater part of whom were boys of thirteen and &s;ixteen years of age. There were but eight batta|lions
<PB N="158" REF="026918_0152_0FD260FA5A583F58">
that had cannon. The cavalry amounted to a 1000 men, con&s;i&s;ting of a 100 excellent troopers of the 20th regiment; 50 of the 6th regiment; the 8th regiment of hu&s;&s;ars, amounting to nearly 300 men, who were new levies, and were ill armed and ill mounted; a hundred Belgic hu&s;&s;ars, that were very good &s;oldiers; eighty Dutch dragoons; and 300 hor&s;e of the legion of the North, commanded by Colonel We&s;termann. The&s;e la&s;t were new levies, and altogether undi&s;ciplined. The light troops were, three Dutch battalions making about 1500 men, and who conducted them&s;elves with great bravery during the expedition; a corps of 1000 Belgi|ans, rai&s;ed at Bruges and Ghent, of which 200 were light-hor&s;e di&s;mounted; and the infantry of the legion of the North, to the number of 1200, who were by no means good &s;oldiers, and were very much given to ma|rauding. This army, which amounted to 18,000 men, mu&s;tered no more than 13,700 men fit for &s;ervice. The artillery con&s;i&s;ted of four 12 pounders, eight 8 pounders, four mortars of 10 inches, twenty hand-grenades, and four howitzers.</P>
<P>General Dumourier divided this little army into four divi&s;ions. The advanced guard, commanded by Gene|ral Berneron, was compo&s;ed of two battalions of Nati|onal guards, two battalions of Dutch refugees, the Bel|gic corps, a party of the legion of the North, the fifty dragoons of the 6th regiment, the eighty Dutch dra|goons, and the cavalry of the legion of the North. The right divi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of nine battalions of National guards, and the two battalions of Gendarmerie, (which could not be reckoned as making more than one batta|lion), with the half of the French hu&s;&s;ars, and was commanded by General d'Arcon, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Colonel We&s;termann. The left divi&s;ion, commanded by Colonel Le Clerc, colonel of the regiment of Bouillon, was compo&s;ed of nine battalions, (one of which con&s;i&s;ted of troops of the line,) and the remainder of the 8th regi|ment of hu&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that this regiment of hu&s;&s;ars re|mained behind for want of hor&s;es and arms, and afterward joined the army of Breda, in a &s;tate almo&s;t unfit for &s;er|vice; and the general was obliged to break the colonel named Dumont, who had been a taylor of Li&s;le, (a drunk|en, ignorant, and di&s;hone&s;t man, but a vehement Jacobin) and to give the regiment to lieutenant-colonel Morgan, one of the general's aids-du-camp.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="026918_0153_0FD2612F5B7C50E0">
The rear-guard of the army was compo&s;ed of a batta|lion of National guards; a Dutch battalion; two hundred Belgians; a hundred troopers of the 20th regiment; and a hundred of the Belgic hu&s;&s;ars; and was commanded by Colonel Tilly, an aid-du-camp of the general. A part of the artillery was attached to each of the&s;e divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>With this &s;mall army the general undertook the con|que&s;t of Holland. But he had a powerful party in the country, who expected him with impatience, and were ready to declare them&s;elves on his penetrating into the country. He had neither time, on account of the nece&s;|&s;ary rapidity of his movements, nor means, for want of good officers in the different corps, to form and di&s;cipline the&s;e troops. But they were ardent, courageous, and impatient for action; and the enterprize they were un|dertaking had a boldne&s;s in it, that extremely well &s;uited the genius of the nation. The general informed this little army of the rigour of the climate into which they were going; the number of &s;trong places, &s;urrounded by inundations, to be taken; and the canals and arms of the &s;ea to be cro&s;&s;ed. But while he told them of the&s;e ob&s;ta|cles, he declared to them that, being once arrived in Hol|land, they would be joined by numerous friends, and would find provi&s;ions, money and every thing they want|ed, in abundance.</P>
<P>The French &s;oldier po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great &s;en&s;ibility and un|der&s;tanding; and is not to be conducted with &s;ucce&s;s by the ordinary means of military men. If his general have the good &s;en&s;e to unfold to him the ob&s;tacles of an enter|prize, he thinks no longer of any thing but conquering them, and actually makes the enterprize an affair of plea&s;ure. But if the danger be concealed from him, he is confounded in di&s;covering it; and if he be once di&s;pirited, or rather di&s;gu&s;ted with being led blindly to a de&s;perate ta&s;k, he gives way to mi&s;tru&s;t, and it becomes impo&s;&s;ible to rally him; or afterwards to controul him <NOTE PLACE="foot">This is a divine pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te of a &s;oldier.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Damourier had cau&s;ed General Berneron to march forward, on the 16th, with the advanced guard; promi&s;ing that he &s;hould be &s;upported &s;hortly by the re&s;t of the army. In written in&s;tructions which he delivered to General Berneron, he ordered him in&s;tantly to &s;end a detachment con&s;i&s;ting of 800 infantry and 100 cavalry, commanded by lieutenant-colonel Daendels, a Dutch refugee, to the</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="026918_0154_0FD260FBC3F100B0">
Moor Dyke, in order to &s;eize upon all the ve&s;&s;els he &s;hould find there, or at Swaluve, or Roowaert: to po&s;t the remainder of his divi&s;ion along the little river of Merck, from Oudenbo&s;ch and Sevenbergen to Breda: and to throw a bridge over the river Merck, in order to &s;ecure a communication with lieutenant-colonel Daendels, and to be able to &s;upport him again&s;t any &s;orties that might be made by the neighbouring garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>In Bergen-up-Zoom, Gertruydenberg, and Breda, there were three regiments of dragoons, amounting to more than all the cavalry of General Dumourier, and a &s;uffi|cient number of infantry to act with them. It is certain that if the&s;e had been a&s;&s;embled together, and had been joined by the cavalry of Bois-le-Duc, and Heu&s;den, they would have been &s;ufficiently &s;trong to have compelled the advanced guard to retire, and thereby to have ruined the expedition. But Dumourier knew that there was not any one of the Dutch generals charged with the defence of the country, or who had authority to draw all the cavalry together; and he was certain that the officers who commanded in the different towns, having no plan of general defence, would attend only to the danger which threatened them re&s;pectively, and would not hazard any part of their garri&s;ons, again&s;t an army, which each of them believed to be very &s;trong, and which appeared, by the extent of its cantonments to menace &s;everal cities at once. Be&s;ide, that the commanding officers of the gar|ri&s;ons were &s;ufficiently embarra&s;&s;ed in preparing means for their defence; not having expected &s;o &s;udden an at|tack, and in this early part of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the general arrived at his fir&s;t po&s;t; and was a&s;toni&s;hed and afflicted to find that his orders had not been executed. No part of the advanced guard had yet pa&s;&s;ed the Merck; by which neglect, time was given to the Dutch to withdraw all their ve&s;&s;els from the Moor Dyke to the &s;ide of Dort, and place them under the pro|tection of three guard&s;hips, which were on that &s;tation. This fir&s;t error rendered the general's pa&s;&s;age to Dort ex|tremely difficult, and almo&s;t impracticable, unle&s;s he could obtain other boats in the place of the&s;e he had expected to &s;eize.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly commanded Berneron and Daendels to pu&s;h forward; and General d'Arcon to inve&s;t Breda with the right divi&s;ion; and Colonel le Clerc clo&s;ely to block|ade Bergen-op-Zoom, and Steenberg, with the le&s;t. The
<PB N="161" REF="026918_0155_0FD261302A319320">
officers who commanded in tho&s;e two la&s;t places abandoned all their out po&s;ts. Colonel le Clerk made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;mall &s;ort of Blaw-&s;luys, at a little di&s;tance from Steenberg, which place he &s;ummoned to &s;urrender. The garri&s;on of Bergen-op-Zoom, made two or three incon|&s;iderable fallies; which produced no other effect than the de&s;ertion of &s;ome of their men, who entered into the Dutch legion.</P>
<P>General Dumourier proceeded, with his rear guard, between the two divi&s;ions of his army, to Sevenbergen; &s;ending his advanced guard forward to Klundert and Wil|liam&s;tadt, with orders to be&s;iege tho&s;e two places. And he commanded Lieutenant-Colonel Daendels to po&s;t him|&s;elf at Nord&s;chantz, in order to cut off the communication between William&s;tadt and Klundert. This officer &s;eized three ve&s;&s;els at Nord&s;chantz.</P>
<P>The general appointed Me&s;&s;rs. Koch and De Ni&s;s to be colonels. The former of them, who was an eloquent &s;peaker, and a man of enterpri&s;ing character, was ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t Daendels; and the latter, a man of information and temperate courage, accompanied the general.</P>
<P>Dumourier did not conceal from him&s;elf the difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing to Dort, by the Moor Dyke. The following was the plan fir&s;t projected for that purpo&s;e. Koch and Daen|dels, according to the in&s;tructions given to Berneron, were to proceed by the 17th to the Moor Dyke with 900 men, &s;upported by the whole of the advanced guard, po&s;t|ed on the Merck. They were to collect all the ve&s;&s;els they could find on that &s;ide; and, on the 21&s;t or 22d at furthe&s;t, embarking all the men they could croud into the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, were to pa&s;s to Dort, which they had rea&s;on to hope would join them; and, aided by the inhabitants, were to di&s;arm the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of 250 men, unle&s;s they &s;hould be willing to incorporate them&s;elves with the army. There were more than a hundred ve&s;&s;els lying at Dort. The&s;e they were to conduct to the Moor Dyke; and, arming three or &s;our with the large&s;t cannon, were to &s;end them forward to drive off the three &s;mall guard &s;hips. Indeed it was propo&s;ed to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els by boarding them, they being both ill-armed and ill manned.</P>
<P>The plan thus far accompli&s;hed, the main body of the army was to proceed to Sevenbergen, Oudenbo&s;ch, Moor Dyke and Swaluve; and, from thence, to pa&s;s to Dort, in one or two divi&s;ions; their embarkation being protected

by the rear guard, who were to de&s;troy the bridge that &s;hould be thrown over the Merck, and to prevent the garri&s;ons, that might attempt to harra&s;s the army, from pa&s;&s;ing the river. The army being once arrived at Dort there was no longer any ob&s;tacle to be feared.</P>
<P>On the evening in which General Dumourier quitted Antwerp, he met, at a little village on his route, the Ba|ron de Stael, who formerly had been Amba&s;&s;ador from Sweden to France, and was now going to Paris. The Baron &s;upped with Dumourier, and informed him that every part of Germany and Holland through which he had pa&s;&s;ed was friendly to the General's enterpri&s;e; and that at Utrecht he was impatiently expected. He al&s;o confirmed the intelligence, which the General had already received, that the party of the Stadtholder were in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation. Without endeavouring to di&s;cover the object of the Baron's journey, the General coun&s;elled him to wait the i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent expedition before he &s;hould explain him&s;elf confidentially to the French Mini&s;try, that he might not too ha&s;tily pledge his court to any certain line of conduct, or expo&s;e his mea|&s;ures to be afterwards di&s;owned; and he advi&s;ed him by all means to be &s;ilent, at Paris, on any &s;ubject but &s;uch as he was willing &s;hould be known to the whole world. This Mini&s;ter a&s;&s;ured the General that he was going to Paris on his private concerns. Dumourier before his de|parture from Antwerp, had given the &s;ame coun&s;el to a per&s;onage from Poland, of very high rank and con&s;e|quence; who, being on his route, had paid a vi&s;it to the General at his quarters. Indeed, the General's maxim uniformly was to take every opportunity of preventing foreign courts from pledging them&s;elves to a mini&s;try, the &s;lave of an a&s;&s;embly of 700 men, without prudence, expe|rience or honor.</P>
<P>Dumourier's original plan was totally deranged by the negligence of the officers, to whom he had entru&s;ted the advanced guard, and the execution of his fir&s;t operations. But he did not abandon his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. He con|certed new means. In the canals between Oudenbo&s;ch and Sevenbergen, he found 23 ve&s;&s;els from 20 to 70 tons. He ordered one of his Commi&s;&s;aries, named Bour&s;ier, an indefatigable and intelligent man, to make them fit to carry 1200 men; and to mount four of them with cannon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> guard of this little &s;quadron. He im|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;mall ports

that are to be found in that part, and a&s;&s;igned them very con&s;iderable pay, on the funds already rai&s;ed by the Dutch Committee, on the credit of the property of the Prince of Orange and his known partizans.</P>
<P>From the moment that Dumourier entered Holland, the army no longer co&s;t the French trea&s;ury any thing more than the daily pay. The inhabitants of their own accord, furni&s;hed provi&s;ions and forage, as well as money to forward the expedition. Never was an army received with &s;uch cordiality; nor ever did &s;oldiers le&s;s merit &s;uch reception; the Gendarmerie and light troops indulging them&s;elves in rapine and every &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion. But from the di&s;grace of this conduct, the troops of the line, and national guards, are to be wholly exempted; &s;ince, on all occa&s;ions, the&s;e conducted them&s;elves with urbanity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As it demanded time to prepare the ve&s;&s;els, the general made another important change in his fir&s;t plan. Accor|ding to that, he meant to deceive and evade the &s;trong places; and, &s;tealing as is were, between them, to embark directly at the Moor Dyke. After that he would have had time to harra&s;s tho&s;e places; and relying on the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;ons, and inexperience of the commanding officers, he calculated on making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of at lea&s;t one of them, which event would give great relief to his army, and furni&s;h him with artillery and ammunition, in both of which he was extremely ill provided.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to undertake no one &s;iege in form.&mdash;To pre&s;s a regular &s;iege forward with vigour, he mu&s;t have a&s;&s;embled his little army in one point, and thereby have given the enemy an opportunity of knowing its weakne&s;s; and, being no longer ma&s;ter of the country, it would have been ea&s;y for the garri&s;ons that were not attacked to re|cover from their &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;&s;emble troops to cut off his communication with Antwerp, drive away his workmen, and de&s;troy his little fleet, without which he had nothing to hope. Wherefore, while Colonel Le Clerc continued to blockade Bergen-op-Zoom and Steenberg, he ordered General d'Arcon to attack Breda, and his advanced guard at the &s;ame time to fall upon Klundert.</P>
<P>Breda is a town celebrated for its &s;trength. It was fur|ni&s;hed with two hundred pieces of cannon, was well pa|li&s;adoed, and protected by an inundation. Twelve hun|dred infantry, and a regiment of dragoons, garri&s;oned the place; but the Governor, the Count de By land, was a

courtie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and had &s;een no &s;ervice. The troops bought their bread at the bakers, their meat at the butchers, without having any magazines. The Dutch towns are mo&s;t of them well protected by inundations, and abound with &s;trong exterior works; but are greatly deficient in ca&s;emates, and the inhabitants are greatly di&s;affected to the government.</P>
<P>General d'Arcon, without opening any trenches, erect|ed two batteries of four mortars and four howitzers, ex|tremely near the town, on the &s;ide of the village of Hage. The enemy an&s;wered by a very bri&s;k fire, during three days; on the fourth, General d'Arcon had no more than &s;ixty bombs left, and mu&s;t have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing the &s;iege after throwing them into the place. At this moment, Colonel Philip de Vaux, an Aid-de-Camp of General Dumourier, entered the place to &s;ummon it fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;econd time, and repre&s;ented to the Count de By and, that General Dumourier was on the point of ar|riving with his whole army, and that then no quarters would be given to the garri&s;on, which &s;o a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">armed the Go|vernor that he capitulated with the con&s;ent of his officers. The honors of war and all the Governor's demands were granted him. The French entered the place; which, ex|cepting &s;ome few hou&s;es, was not at all damaged. They found two hundred and fifty <HI>bouches a &s;eu,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">The tran&s;lator does not knew wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e are.</NOTE> near three hundred thou&s;and weight of powder, and five thou&s;and fu&s;ees, of which they were in great want. This &s;iege did not co&s;t more than twenty men on each &s;ide. The French carried their temerity &s;o far as to dance the <HI>Carmagnole</HI> on the glacis, on the &s;ide which was not inundated. Thirty dragoons of the regiment of By|land &s;allied out upon the&s;e men, killed &s;ome and returned with &s;ix pri&s;oners, having lo&s;t two or three men and &s;ome of their hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The be&s;ieging army amounted to no more than five thou&s;and men; and, of the&s;e, twelve hundred were de|tached to &s;eize upon &s;orts on the &s;luices, on the &s;ide of Hue&s;den.</P>
<P>Klundert was taken in two days after the &s;urrender of Breda. The works of this &s;mall &s;ort were extremely re|gular, and the place was protected by inundations that entirely &s;urrounded it. It was defended with great vigour, but with little judgment, by a lieutenant colonel in the

Dutch &s;ervice, who was a We&s;tphalian. He had no more than a hundred and fifty men in the place. General Berneion had erected a battery of four cannon and a num|ber of &s;mall mortars clo&s;e behind the dyke, at a hundred and fifty toi&s;es from the place; &s;o that the hou&s;es of that &s;mal1 city were almo&s;t entirely de&s;troyed. The com|manding officer, after keeping up an almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant fire during &s;everal days with little effect, and having no long|er any &s;helter for his troops, re&s;olved to &s;pike his cannon, and to endeavour to retreat with the remainder of his gar|ri&s;on to William&s;tadt. He was intercepted by a detach|ment of the Dutch refugees, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hartmann, whom he &s;hot dead, receiving at the &s;ame time a ball which killed him on the &s;pot, and his men were made pri&s;oners. The French carried the body of this officer to Klundert, after having taken the keys of the town which were found in his pocket.</P>
<P>In this place were found fifty-three pieces of cannon, &s;ome mortars, a great quantity of bombs and &s;hot, and about eighty thou&s;and weight of powder.</P>
<P>General Dumourier lo&s;t no time in &s;ending Berneron to be&s;iege William&s;tadt. And it was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the ammuni|tion and artillery of Klundert that the new &s;iege was un|dertaken.</P>
<P>Dumourier al&s;o ordered General d'Arcon to commence the &s;iege of Gertruydenberg. This &s;mall town was ill defended on the &s;ide of Ram&s;doneck, having in that quarter only a &s;light palli&s;adoe along the river, and be|ing commanded by neighbouring heights. But on the left &s;ide of the Donge, it was protected by an exten&s;ive in|undation, and by two lines of extremely &s;trong outworks, which could not have been carried in three weeks, had they been ably and vigorou&s;ly defended. The garri&s;on was compo&s;ed of the regiment of Hertzel, amounting to be|tween eight or nine hundred men, and of a fine regiment of dragoons belonging to the Stadtholder's guard. The go|vernor, named Bedault, a major general in the &s;ervice, was an old man of eighty. General d'Arcon began the attack with cannon, and mortars that he brought from Breda. All the outworks were carried, or abandoned by the enemy on the &s;econd day. D'Arcon erected batteries on &s;ome of them; and after a few &s;hot were exchanged, Colonel de Vaux entered the place, the capitulation was &s;ettled, the honours of war were granted, and General Du|mourier,
<PB N="166" REF="026918_0160_0FD261002D04C3D8">
who had arrived meanwhile, dined with the old General Bedault, who acknowledged to him that he had &s;urrendered becau&s;e he had been di&s;appointed in his ex|pectations of receiving ve&s;&s;els from Dort to Gorcum, to enable him to evacuate the place. A few bombs had fal|len on the city and one on the general's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>During dinner, a me&s;&s;enger came to inform the gover|nor that the terms of capitulation had been violated by a lieutenant-colonel of the National guards, who, being drunk, in&s;olently in&s;i&s;ted on entering the city in &s;pite of the centinels; and had attempted to di&s;charge a pi&s;tol at the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Hirtzel. General Dumourier ordered the drunkard to be brought into the room, tore the epaulet from his &s;houlder, and reduced him to the ranks, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the officers of the garri&s;on. who interceded for his pardon.</P>
<P>General Dumourier conver&s;ed much with this garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of exceeding fine troops. He has fre|quently &s;ince thought of an expre&s;&s;ion of the lieutenant colonel of the regiment of Hirtzel, who walking with him on the ramparts, &s;aid <HI>Hodie mihi, cras tibi.</HI> The hone&s;t Swi&s;s &s;poke prophetically.</P>
<P>This new conque&s;t gave us a hundred and fifty <HI>bonches a feu,</HI> two hundred thou&s;and weight of powder, a quantity of bombs and ball, twenty-five hundred new fu&s;ees, and what was mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential an excellent port, and more than thirty ve&s;&s;els of various &s;izes. We had al&s;o taken five ve&s;&s;els at Breda.</P>
<P>This was in the beginning of March. While the&s;e &s;ieges were carrying forward, the general pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of the time at the Moor Dyke, whence, it be|ing in the centre of his operations, he directed the &s;ieges on his right and left, and &s;uperintended the fitting out of his &s;quadron. His commi&s;&s;ary Bour&s;ier having, with in|credible exertions, found means to arm twenty-three ve&s;|&s;els, and to victual them for twelve hundred men, the general &s;ent them down the canal of Sevenbergen to Roo|waert, which is a &s;mall creek, lying a quarter of a league we&s;t of the Moor Dyke.</P>
<P>On the day the general e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters in this village with an hundred Dutch cha&s;&s;eurs and fifty dra|goons, he was cannonaded the whole day, by three guard &s;hips. Having po&s;ted his cha&s;&s;eurs along the Dyke, by which two men were killed on board the ve&s;&s;els, he com|pelled them to abandon their &s;ituation. A few hours af|ter,
<PB N="167" REF="026918_0161_0FD26134C0C835E8">
he ordered twelve twenty-four pounders from Breda, together with ammunition, and con&s;tructed &s;everal batte|ries, one of which was at Roowaert, to protect the &s;ailing of his &s;quadron, and the re&s;t at the Moor Dyke to cover his embarkment. He was there per&s;uaded that his cannon would carry more than half way over the canal; and in|deed the enemy's armed &s;hips did not again approach the &s;ide occupied by the French.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed huts covered with &s;traw to be rai&s;ed along the &s;ands from Roowaert to Swaluve. There the &s;oldiers amu&s;ed them&s;elves and were extremely happy, but impa|tient to cro&s;s to Dort. Dumourier je&s;tingly told them that they re&s;embled beavers; and he named this aquatic can|tonment, the camp of Beavers. Provi&s;ions were in plen|ty; the water was not bad; and brandy was di&s;tributed to the troops every morning. The general gave his troops an example of firmne&s;s; and was lodged and lived like the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In this expedition, the general chalked him&s;elf out a &s;y&s;tem for carrying on war in countries overflowed by water. It would not be impo&s;&s;ible, by means of dykes, to march over any part of Holland, to conduct artillery, and e&s;tabli&s;h batteries at plea&s;ure: excepting in the ca&s;e of being oppo&s;ed by gun-boats, when it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have an adequate force of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>General Dumourier had, among his battalions of volun|teers, &s;everal men from Ga&s;cony, Brittany, Normandy, and Dunkirk. Of the&s;e men he formed a body of from four to five hundred &s;ailors, giving th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m twenty &s;ols per day in addition to their pay. The general's &s;quadron at Roowaert was de&s;igned to carry his advanced guard, and he appointed an Engli&s;h naval officer, and a lieutenant of the Dutch navy to command it; with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome pilots belonging to the country. But the nece&s;&s;ary de|lays had given time to the Dutch to augment con&s;iderably their &s;quadron in the <HI>Bi&s;bos,</HI> which is the &s;mall &s;ea of the Moor Dyke. That &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted already of twelve armed &s;hips, one of which carried twenty. guns; and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were di&s;po&s;ed of with great judgment for oppo|&s;ing the general's pa&s;&s;age, and acting in concert. But Dumourier calculated, in ca&s;e the wind &s;hould be &s;ettled, that not more then half the &s;quadron could engage him, as tho&s;e which &s;hould be to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeward of him would not, in that ca&s;e be able to rearh him.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="026918_0162_0FD26102EFBFC528">
The Dutch had al&s;o erected batteries at Stry, and all along the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Dort; which it was &s;aid was reinforced by 1200 of the Engli&s;h guards, who had landed &s;ince the declaration of war at Helvoet Sluys. The general however was convinced that the enemy had no certain intelligence of his plan, becau&s;e the Prince of Orange was making his greate&s;t preparations for defence at Gorcum, and had a&s;&s;embled an army there to oppo&s;e his march: this army was yet incon&s;iderable; the rein|forcements of the Engli&s;h and emigrants augmenting it to no more than 4000 men.</P>
<P>Dumourier, &s;till to deceive the enemy re&s;pecting his real de&s;ign, continued the blockade of Bergen-op-Zoom and Steenberg. General de Flers was returned from Paris, and had obtained the reinforcement that he de|manded, which arrived with great di&s;patch. Dumourier ordered him to occupy the cantonments of Colonel Le Clerc at Ro&s;endael, and round Bergen-op-Zoom with 6000 men, which orders were rapidly executed. He or|dered the left divi&s;ion to approach Oudenbo&s;ch, and Se|vernbergen. He &s;ent the national gendarmerie, with &s;ome cavalry, from his right, to &s;hew them&s;elves on the &s;ide of Heu&s;den. A lieutenant-colonel of the gendarmerie &s;um|moned that place; and, ridiculou&s;ly enough, addre&s;&s;ed the governor by the phra&s;e of citizen governor, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual appellation.</P>
<P>General Berneron continued the &s;iege of William&s;tadt; but with very ill &s;ucce&s;s. He had commenced his attack at too great a di&s;tance; and con&s;umed a great quantity of ammunition, without making any progre&s;s. There was but one front of this town which was open to attack, and that was extremely narrow: and the Dutch had thrown re-inforcements into the town by &s;ea. Dumourier &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of General Berneron, Dubois de Crance, (an engineer of great merit, and very different in charac|ter from his unworthy brother, the member of the na|tional convention) and another engineer named Mare&s;cot. The&s;e two valuable officers re&s;olved to draw nearer the town; and while they were erecting a battery at the di&s;|tance of 200 toi&s;es from the place, they were abandoned by their &s;oldiers, and were &s;lain in a &s;ortie, that the enemy made on the workmen. General Berneron, notwith|&s;tanding, continued the &s;iege ob&s;tinately, which was not rai&s;ed till after the departure of General Dumourier for the grand army.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="026918_0163_0FD2613629CE0E90">
The general having found a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;hipping at Gertruydenberg, he re&s;olved to u&s;e them in facilitating his pa&s;&s;age to Dort. He had a &s;ufficient num|ber of ve&s;&s;els at Roowaert for his advanced guard. Ma&s;|ter of Breda, Klundert, and Gertruydenberg, and leaving the corps under General de Flers to continue the block|ade of Steenberg and Bergen-op-Zoom, he had &s;ecured his rear guard from being harra&s;&s;ed. He therefore cau&s;ed his rear guard to advance to Swaluve, at which place there were ve&s;&s;els for its embarkation; and he re&s;olved to em|bark his right divi&s;ion in the ve&s;&s;els of Gertruydenberg.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age from Gertruydenberg to the i&s;land of Dort is &s;omewhat longer than that from the Moor Dyke. To the right, and even in front of this port, the <HI>Bi&s;hos</HI> is filled with &s;and banks, and numerous &s;mall i&s;lands detached from the main land of Gorcum; mo&s;t of which are cover|ed with trees and underwood. The armed &s;hips of the enemy drew too much water to approach the&s;e i&s;lands. There were however, three barks each carrying four cannon, and thirty men, &s;tationed at different points to guard the pa&s;&s;age. Beyond the&s;e &s;mall i&s;lands many of which are covered by the tide at high water, was &s;ituated an i&s;land much more elevated above the water than the re&s;t, on which was a &s;mall farm belonging to an inhabi|tant of Gertruydenberg. This i&s;land, which the enemy's large&s;t ve&s;&s;els could not approach within &s;even or eight hundred toi&s;es, was &s;eparated from the i&s;land of Dort only by a &s;pace of &s;ix hundred toi&s;es, which was guarded by a battery mounting &s;ix cannon, &s;tanding on a low and mud|dy &s;oil on the i&s;land of Dort, and by a frigate of fourteen guns, &s;tationed under the battery.</P>
<P>The general re&s;olved to land two battalions, with &s;ix four and twenty pounders in this i&s;land; and to erect a battery to drive off the frigate, who&s;e guns appeared to be &s;mall. Having done this, he de&s;igned to embark with his right divi&s;ion in the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els belonging to Ger|truydenberg and to pa&s;s over in the &s;ame route.</P>
<P>As he might be compelled to engage one of the ve&s;&s;els of four guns, in his pa&s;&s;age to the i&s;land, he de&s;igned to fill &s;everal large &s;hallops with cho&s;en men on board that ve&s;&s;el, and ordered two ve&s;&s;els each carrying two cannon to be ready to precede him, giving the command of one to an Engli&s;h naval officer named White, and of the other to Lieutenant Colonel La Rue, an aid-de-camp of the gene|ral, who had been in the &s;ea-&s;ervice. Every preparation

was made with &s;uch celerity that it was the general's de|&s;ign to have attempted the pa&s;&s;age on the night of the 8th or 10th. But events of a very different nature were ar|riving, and the rapidity of his fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s was followed by a &s;till more rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of evils which decided the fate of the war.</P>
<P>Dumourier in the mid&s;t of his plans, and notwith&s;tand|ing his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had for &s;ome days been a prey to the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. The &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht had been commenced on the 20th of February; but although Ge|neral Miranda had &s;et fire to &s;everal quarters of the city, it was defended it with extreme ob&s;tinacy, by reinforce|ments of the emigrants, who a&s;&s;embled there in great num|bers, headed by M.d'Autichamp, a lieutenant-general in the army of the Prince of Conde, and an excellent officer; to whom it is &s;aid the Dutch owe the &s;afety of the city of Mae&s;tricht.</P>
<P>General Champmorin had, without any oppo&s;ition made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fort of Steven&s;waert, on the Meu&s;e; and al&s;o of fort St. Michael, which commands the entrance, the left &s;ide of that river, of the bridge of Venloo. But he had not been able to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Venloo, the Pru&s;|&s;ians having already entered it.</P>
<P>General Valence, although he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed military talents, had not acquired &s;ufficient authority over the troops effec|tually to compen&s;ate for the ab&s;ence of Dumourier. He remained at Leige; and had neither rai&s;ed the winter quar|ters of the troops, nor drawn them clo&s;er together. And great mi&s;under&s;tandings exi&s;ted among the generals.</P>
<P>General Stengel occupied the quarters round Aix-la-|Chapelle. He was an officer well ver&s;ed in the di&s;ci|pline and duties of light troops, and was excellently cal|culated to command an advanced guard.</P>
<P>General Dampierre commanded in Aix-la-Chapelle, where he was entirely taken up with his plea&s;ures, and the means of gratifying his rapacity. He was a man of a fierce, and ambitious &s;pirit, ra&s;h in the extreme, but was without talent, and was even timid at times through his exce&s;&s;ive ignorance. He hated his &s;uperiors; and ma|chinated with the Jacobins of Paris, for the fabrication of calumnies, by which he aimed at the command of the ar|mies.</P>
<P>The Prince of Coburg, who had arrived at Cologne, was acquainted with the mi&s;under&s;tandings of the generals, and the injudicious, and &s;eeble di&s;po&s;ition of the troops.
<PB N="171" REF="026918_0165_0FD26137A6B18480">
A&s;&s;embling his army he marched to Aldenhoven, where he penetrated into the French quarters without ob&s;tacle. The French in&s;tantly abandoned all their po&s;ts, without making the lea&s;t &s;tand again&s;t the enemy; and fell back upon Liege in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion. General le Ve|neur, who commanded the attack of Mae&s;tricht on the &s;ide of Wyck, had the good fortune to have &s;ufficient time to pa&s;s the Meu&s;e with his cannon. The Imperiali&s;ts entered Ma&s;tricht. Miranda, notwith&s;tanding ought to have continued the bombardment from the left &s;ide of the liver; and, collecting his army between Tongres and Mae&s;tricht, which was a tolerable po&s;ition, he might then have prevented the further progre&s;s of the Prince of Co|burg.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the orders given to Miranda by General Dumourier, on his receiving news of the di&s;a&s;ter. This was al&s;o the advice of General Valence. That General a few days after &s;aved a column con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-&s;e|ven battalions on their retreat from Liege, by making a vigorous charge on the enemy, at the head of his cavalry on the plains of Tongres: and Lieutenant-General La|noue di&s;played the greate&s;t bravery, in his retreat from Aix-la-Chapelle.</P>
<P>But Miranda was di&s;concerted, and lo&s;t all pre&s;ence of mind. On his own authority, he ordered the troops to abandon the Meu&s;e. The Imperiali&s;ts followed up their victory, pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e, entered Liege, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French magazines, which were con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in the article of cloathing. So great was the con&s;ternation in the French army, that, excepting the heavy artillery which was carried off to Louvain, and from thence to Tournay, every thing was abandoned, including even the baggage of the troops.</P>
<P>The two generals, Miranda and Valence, a&s;&s;embled their forces in the camp of Louvain. Champorin, who could no longer maintain his po&s;ition on the left &s;ide of the Meu&s;e, evacuated Steven&s;waert, and Fort St. Michael, (in which places he ought to have left garri&s;ons) and re|treated to Die&s;t. General la Marliere, who was at Rure|monde, fell back to the &s;ame place. This retreat left the Pru&s;&s;ians ma&s;ters of the Lower Meu&s;e. They had it in their power in&s;tantly to have cro&s;&s;ed the country of Campine; and, by the route of Antwerp or Bois-le-Duc, might have fallen on the rear of the French army in Hol|land.
<PB N="172" REF="026918_0166_0FD26108D3501F50">
Prince Frederick of Brun&s;wick lo&s;t this important opportunity; and General Dumourier, availing him&s;elf of the neglect, afterward placed his army in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The troops under Miranda and Valence, were utterly di&s;couraged. They openly blamed and menaced their general officers, more e&s;pecially Miranda, who was in con&s;iderable danger of his life. At length however Ge|neral Valence, aided by the prudence of General Thou|venot, re&s;tored &s;ome degree of order in the army. But the de&s;ertion of the army was enormous. More than 10,000 men ab&s;olutely returned to France. The army loudly demanded the pre&s;ence of General Dumourier. The commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention di&s;patched courier after courier, urging his departure for Louvain. The general con&s;tantly an&s;wered them, that they might main|tain the army in its pre&s;ent po&s;ition; and that &s;till there was nothing to be feared if they gave him time to accom|pli&s;h his pre&s;ent object. This was true. General Va|lence, and General Thouvenot were of the &s;ame opinion. But Miranda now betrayed terror altogether proportion|ate to the ra&s;hne&s;s which had hitherto governed him, which ju&s;tified the di&s;patches of General Valence, who from the fir&s;t predicted this check, while Miranda's let|ters uniformly a&s;&s;erted, that the army of the Imperiali&s;ts was not to be feared. And certainly his opinions would have been ju&s;t, if the French had taken a judicious po&s;i|tion, with an equal force, which they might and ought to have done. It was to be pre&s;umed that the Prince of Co|bourg would not have cho&s;en to hazard a battle; or, if he had, the French had no rea&s;on to fear the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention hurried precipi|tately to Paris. They made a report &s;o alarming, and painted the con&s;ternation of the &s;oldiers in &s;uch &s;trong co|lours, that it was univer&s;ally acknowledged that General Dumourier could alone &s;top the progre&s;s of the di&s;a&s;ter, and &s;ave the army. He was commanded in the mo&s;t ab|&s;olute terms, to abandon the expedition of Holland, and in&s;tantly to put him&s;elf at the head of the grand army. He received the orders on the evening of the 8th of March, and departed on the 9th, in a &s;tate bordering no de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Dumourier gave the command of his army to General de Flers. He knew the capacity of this general to be in|adequate to the ta&s;k; but he had not another general officer he could put in his place. General d'Arcon was extremly afflicted with the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and could not keep the
<PB N="173" REF="026918_0167_0FD2613D8FECBC88">
field, and had even refu&s;ed the rank of lieutenant-gene|ral, which Dumourier would have obtained for him, sa a reward for the taking of Breda. He retired to Antwerp. Lieutenant General Mara&s;&s;e, an old &s;oldier, who com|manded at Anwerp, could not on account of his great age, be entru&s;ted in an active &s;ituation, although he was a man of courage and experience. And it was Dumou|rier's de&s;ign to &s;end General Miranda into Holland, on his arrival at the grand army.</P>
<P>Dumourier left Colonel Thouvenot, who was the &s;oul of his little army, with General de Flers. He gave the colonel a copy of the in&s;tructions he had delivered to Gene|ral de Flers, whom he recommended to undertake no en|terprize without the concurrence of Colonel Thouvenot. He ordered him in&s;tantly to attempt the pa&s;&s;age of Ger|truydenberg; and, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, to forward di&s;|patches to Dumourier, and to remain at Dort till he &s;hould receive his further in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>But the departure of General Dumourier, utterly di&s;|pirited this army. Tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t forward, impatient, and daring, on every occa&s;ion, now co&s;ider|ed the undertaking to be impracticable. In truth, it became &s;uch &s;hortly afterward. The Dutch &s;quadron be|ing reinforced, and the Pru&s;&s;ians being on their march by Bois-le-duc, de Flers, in pur&s;uance of his in&s;tructions in the ca&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age to Dort not taking place, threw him&s;elf into Breda, with &s;ix battalions and two hundred hor&s;e, Colonel Tilly into Gertruydenberg, with three battalions, and fifty hor&s;e, The remainder of the army returned &s;afely to Antwerp, owing to the good conduct of Colonel de Vaux, and Colonel Thouvenot. Tho&s;e officers withdrew from the batteries of the Moor Dyke, with the greate&s;t prudence, and con&s;tancy; and although the army was thrown into di&s;order, they effected the re|treat without lo&s;s. The fortifications of Klundert were blown up by Thouvenot, who had not time to put that &s;mall &s;ort in a &s;tate of defence.</P>
<P>And thus terminated Dumourier's enterprize again&s;t Holland. An enterprize, projected and begun in ten days, which did not burthen France with the additional charge of one &s;ol, and which probably had &s;ucceeded but for the unfortunate retreat of Aix-la-Chapelle.</P>
<P>Two &s;trong places were acquired in this expedition, by which the progre&s;s of the enemy might have been arre&s;ted; and which might &s;erve as magazines, and a place of arms,
<PB N="174" REF="026918_0168_0FD2610B1025F8E0">
if the de&s;ign of entering Holland had been re&s;umed. In a word, France reaped no di&s;grace in this quarter. But now Dumourier's projects were once more changed; and he was again compelled to form new plans, as well re&s;pect|ing the interior &s;ituatian of France, as with re&s;pect to her enemies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The General arrives at Antwerp. Sends the Agents of the Executive Power from that Town. Arrives at Bru&s;&s;els. Addre&s;&s;es the Repre&s;entatives of the People. Writes to the Convention. Arre&s;ts Chepy, and E&s;tienne. Several Proclamations. Arrives on the 13th of March at Lou|vain. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention come to that City to meet the General.</HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the importance of the con|cerns which had occupied General Dumourier's mind, &s;ince his departure from Paris, he had not overlooked, nor failed to lament as much as the Belgians them&s;elves, the dete&s;table tyranny exerci&s;ed over them by the National Convention, and by the agents of the Executive Power. The in&s;olence of the&s;e latter, the Satellites of a varice and oppre&s;&s;ion, was not exceeded even by their atrocious vil|lainies. &mdash;Their conduct was a ti&s;&s;ue of ridiculous circum|&s;tances. Mo&s;t of them a&s;&s;umed the military honors, and never walked the &s;treets without a guard. They &s;et all rules at defiance; and, finding that they were not &s;ufficiently numerous to &s;pread their extortions through the whole extent of tho&s;e rich provinces, they augmented their means by i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ions to other per&s;ons like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through Bruges the General was invited to a ball. One of the&s;e gentlemen, who was dancing, ac|co&s;ted the General on his entering the room; and an|nouncing him&s;elf as a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Executive Pow er, he acquainted the General that he was on his road to Oftend and Nieuport, to put tho&s;e places in a proper &s;tate of defence. The General &s;ternly commanded him to con|fine him&s;elfe to the functions of his office; to execute tho&s;e with mode&s;ty, and thenceforward, to forbear intruding
<PB N="175" REF="026918_0169_0FD2613FC075C470">
him&s;elf into military concerns.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e per&s;onages, named, as I think, Lieu|taud, who was &s;tationed at Ruremonde, as a talk-ma&s;ter to General la Marliere, wrote a long letter to Dumourier, <HI>Thouing</HI> and <HI>Theeing</HI> him throughout, and commanding him to abandon every other enterprize, in order to march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ruremonde. The General &s;ent this letter to Le Brun, contenting him&s;elf with adding by way of po&s;t&s;cript, <HI>This letter ought to be dated,</HI> CHAREN|TON.</P>
<P>A third, named Cochelet, who re&s;ided at Liege, having received notice of the declaration of war decreed on the fir&s;t of February, ordered a detachment of troops to attend him, and, marching on the Dutch territory before Mae&s;tricht, proclaimed the war, tore up the po&s;ts on which were the arms of the States General, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Se|ven United Provinces, in the name of the French Repub|lic.</P>
<P>This impertinent parade &s;erved as a warning to the Governor of Mae&s;tricht to withdraw his cavalry cantoned round the city, (together with a con&s;iderable quantity of forage) which General Miaczyn&s;ky was on the point of &s;ur|pri&s;ing. General Miranda naturally condemned this con|duct, becau&s;e he was not yet prepared to act again&s;t Mae&s;tricht. Cochelet &s;ent the General a written order to take Mae&s;tricht before the 20th of February, on pain of being denounced as a traitor; and he &s;ent a copy of the letter to the National Convention, who applauded his Roman firmne&s;s. Cochelet, however, was recalled; be|cau&s;e, intoxicated with the honors of his procon&s;ul&s;hip, he had treated contemptuou&s;ly the authority of the deputies of the Convention.</P>
<P>When General Dumourier arrived at Antwerp on the &s;econd of February, he found that city humiliated and ter|rified by the pre&s;ence of one of the&s;e &s;ubaltern tyrants, who&s;e name he has forgotten, and whom he cau&s;ed to be recalled. Every city in Belgium was governed by one or more of the&s;e execrable Procon&s;uls. They enter|ed on their office by &s;eque&s;tering the &s;ilver of the churches, the revenues of the clergy, and the e&s;tates of the nobility. They then pillaged, or &s;old to their accomplices at an ex|ce&s;&s;ively inferior price, the furniture of the nobles and elergy. They &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the national impo&s;ts to flatter the people, degraded the magi&s;trates from their &s;eats, erect|ed
<PB N="176" REF="026918_0170_0FD2610C2BF52898">
clubs, and exerci&s;ed an arbitrary authority, by the ald of the military, who blindly obeyed them.</P>
<P>Throughout the provinces of Belgium this wild tyranny was become in&s;upportable. Dumourier had made reiter|ated complaints of this tyranny to the Convention, as well as to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, Camus, Treil|hard, Merlin and Go&s;&s;uin, whom he met at Ghent; but the&s;e latter either were not willing, or had not authority to redre&s;s the evil. He repre&s;ented to them, that on the Prince of Coburg's appearing in force on the frontier, a general in&s;urrection of the Belgians was to be expected, that our weakened garri&s;ons would be ma&s;&s;acred, and our crimes puni&s;hed by the hands of tho&s;e we had oppre&s;&s;ed; and that this war was, in a manifold degree, more dangerous than the war with the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The route of the troops at Aix-la Chapelle, their pre|cipitate flight to Louvain, their con&s;u&s;ion, terror, and de&s;ertion, greatly increa&s;ed the danger, which Du|mourier had fore&s;een, of a general in&s;urrection in Bel|gium.</P>
<P>The danger was aggravated by the conduct of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention. They called on the provinces to expre&s;s their re&s;olution of being united to France. The people were a&s;&s;embled in the churches without any order or decency. A French Commi&s;&s;ioner, &s;upported by the commanding officer of the place, by &s;oldiers, and by French and Belgic Clubi&s;ts, read the act of union, which &s;eldom was under&s;tood by any per&s;on pre&s;ent, any more than the harangue made on the occa|&s;ion; the act was notwith&s;tanding &s;igned by the audience, generally with trembling hands; reports of the proceed|ings were printed, and &s;ent to the Convention, who forth|with created another department.</P>
<P>The&s;e fraternal proceedings were often effected by vi|olence. At Bru&s;&s;els and at Mons, mu&s;kets and &s;abres were employed in the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;everal per&s;ons were wounded. Prote&s;ts were formally made again&s;t the union. Partial in&s;urrections took place at Wawres, Hall, Braine, and Soignies. The mo&s;t dangerous was at Grammont. Ten thou&s;and pea&s;ants a&s;&s;embled in arms, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;everal cannon. They impri&s;oned the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and drove back detachments of the garri&s;on of Ghent. The&s;e tumults increa&s;ed hourly. The French ar|my, &s;carcely in force to re&s;i&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, could not
<PB N="177" REF="026918_0171_0FD26140C64214D0">
&s;pare troops &s;o put an end to the&s;e cruel conte&s;ts, which were &s;preading over the whole of Belgium; and it had been ea&s;y for a few Fleni&s;h officers belonging to the Imperial army, with &s;ome cho&s;en &s;oldiers, to have in&s;inuated them|&s;elves into the French quarters, by means of their know|ledge of the language, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have given a regular form to this inte&s;tine war.</P>
<P>Dumourier hated the inju&s;tice of the National Conven|vention, and re&s;i&s;ted every attempt to make him the in|&s;trument of its tyranny and the &s;courge of Belgium. A two-fold intere&s;t therefore directed his conduct at pre&s;ent. His objects were to deliver this unhapy country, and to &s;ave his army. As to his &s;ucce&s;s in the former, he invokes the te&s;timony of the Belgians, from whom he recei|ved the mo&s;t honourable marks of e&s;teem and gratitude, in travelling through that country, when he no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the influence of &s;tation.</P>
<P>Arriving at Antwerp on the 11th, he found that city in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion and alarm. A Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Executive Power, named Chau&s;&s;art, who mode&s;tly &s;urnamed him&s;elf Publicola, had recently removed the magi&s;trates, and had i&s;&s;ued orders to arre&s;t them and the other principal citizens, to the number of &s;ixty-&s;even. General Mara&s;&s;e eluded the execution of this order, with which he was charged by <HI>Publicola</HI>; but the bi&s;hop of Ant|werp and the other pro&s;cribed per&s;ons were either fled or had concealed them&s;elves. Dumourier &s;ent a written or|der to Chau&s;&s;art and his colleagues, to quit Antwerp, and to go to Bru&s;&s;els in&s;tantly, declaring, in ca&s;e of di&s;obedi|ence, that he would give orders to General Mara&s;&s;e to take them there by force. Chau&s;&s;art came to the Ge|neral with much dignity, or in&s;olence, and complained of this order, &s;aying, that it &s;eemed to be dictated by a Vizir. The General an&s;wered with good humour, <HI>I am certainly as much of a Vizir, as you are of Publicola.</HI></P>
<P>General Dumourier compelled Chau&s;&s;ant to quit the town immediately. He rein&s;tated the magi&s;trates, and re|&s;tored the peace of that important city. He i&s;&s;ued an or|dinance, prohibiting the Jacobin club in any degree to interfere in public affairs. He commanded General Mara&s;&s;e to wall up the door of the hall where the club a&s;|&s;embled, to impri&s;on every member that di&s;obeyed this ordinance, to print the order in both languages, and to po&s;t it up and publi&s;h it throughout the city.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="026918_0172_0FD2610DCAFD89A0">
Dumourier afterwards departed for Bru&s;&s;els. Having received complaints from that city of the attrocious con|duct of General Moreton, he had a few days previous to his departure removed him from the command; which he had conferred on Lieutenant-General Duval. Moreton at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to obey the General; but in con&s;equence of an order from the mini&s;ter at war, he took upon him the command at Douay, where he had an opportunity of pur|&s;uing his former &s;y&s;tem of conduct till his death.</P>
<P>General Duval was an extremely good officer, and it was the ill &s;tate of his health alone which prevented his being with the army. He had &s;erved the preceding year with great reputation and &s;ucce&s;s. His judgment was clear, he abounded in the qualities that beget e&s;teem, and was perfectly calcutated to heal the wounds inflicted by Moreton's tyranny.</P>
<P>Duval gave the general a more particular account, than he had hitherto received, of the di&s;order and con&s;ter|nation that reigned among the troops a&s;&s;embled at Lou|vain, from which place Duval had recently arrived. Al|mo&s;t all the tents had been lo&s;t in the retreat. There was not left a &s;ufficient number to encamp half the army; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;tore any degree of courage to the troops, or to make any movement with &s;afety, with|out encamping them for a while. A great part of the field pieces had been al&s;o lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The general officers commanding the artillery, receiv|ing no orders during the confu&s;ion of the retreat, nor in|deed demanding any, held a council of war among them|&s;elves, in which it was re&s;olved to carry off the whole park of artillery and conduct it into France. All the twenty|four pounders, the &s;ixteen pounders, the mortars, and pon|toons, were already at Tournay, on their route to France; fortunately, however, the heavy artillery, and the how|itzers, were &s;till at Anderletcht. The&s;e latter the gene|ral ordered to join the army at Louvain; and tho&s;e at Tournay not to proceed on their route to France.</P>
<P>Bru&s;&s;els was filled with officers and &s;oldiers of the ar|my, who were on their return to France. The general &s;ent them back to the camp at Louvain; and di&s;patched orders to Tournay and Mons, and the cities in the de|partment of the north, to arre&s;t and &s;end back to the ar|my all the fugitives returning into France.</P>
<P>Dumourier ordered General Stengel, who had retired to Namur, and two &s;quadrons of hu&s;&s;ars, to join the army.
<PB N="179" REF="026918_0173_0FD26142B5129BE0">
General Neuilly, who was in his winter quarters in the country of Stavelo, with the half of the advanced guard of the army of the Ardennes, at the time of the flight from Aix-la-Chapelle, had al&s;o retired to Namur, and the ge|neral ordered him to po&s;t his troops at Judoigne, to &s;e|cure the communication between the grand army, and the corps commanded by Lieutenant-general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ville.

The garri&s;on of Bru&s;&s;els was by no means &s;trong, yet the general was obliged to &s;elect &s;ome of its be&s;t battalions to reinforce the army.</P>
<P>Ten thou&s;and men ba&s;tily rai&s;ed in the department of the north were &s;ent to the army. This reinforcement was greatly boa&s;ted of. The name of centurions had been given to the&s;e troops. They con&s;i&s;ted of companies which were nominally a hundred men each, but were, in fact, much below that number, compo&s;ed of old men and children, armed with pikes, cula&s;&s;es, fowling pieces, and pi&s;tols. They had been promi&s;ed twenty &s;ols per day, and were de&s;igned to garri&s;on the towns of Belgium, but not, as they them&s;elves &s;aid, to defend them, or to fight <NOTE PLACE="foot">&mdash;de garder les places de la Belgians, mais <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> di&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, de les de|fendre, ni de fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Lague<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></NOTE>. This militia, the offspring of a plan of Go&s;&s;uin and Mer|lin, &s;erved only to heighten the embarra&s;&s;ment, confu&s;ion, and want of di&s;cipline, which already prevailed, and the general was impatient till he had &s;ent; them back to France.</P>
<P>But an object even more important to General Du|mourier, than the&s;e concerns, was to calm the minds of the Belgians and to re&s;tore public confidence throughout the country, by putting a final period to the &s;y&s;tem under which they had &s;uffered. He was not ignorant that in this attempt he &s;hould excite the Jacobins, and the conven|tion, to proceed to extremity with him. The time, how|ever, for conciliatory mea&s;ures, as well as for deliberation, was entirely pa&s;&s;ed: &s;o great were the evils to be reme|died,
<PB N="180" REF="026918_0174_0FD2610F654A2480">
&s;o enormous the wrongs that had been done to the Belgians, and &s;o immediately was the danger of vengeance being taken by that people.</P>
<P>A few days before Dumourier arrived at Bru&s;&s;els, Chepy had urged General Duval to order &s;everal executions. He threatened to fire Bru&s;&s;els, or to put it to the &s;word. He had arre&s;ted &s;everal of the wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hie&s;t citizens, and &s;ent them to be confined in the fortre&s;&s;es of the department of the north. General Dumourier now arre&s;ted him, and &s;ent him under a guard, to Paris.</P>
<P>The legion of <HI>Sans-Culottes,</HI> rai&s;ed by General More|ton, and compo&s;ed of the lowe&s;t of the populace, held the city in awe, and daily committed unheard of cruelties and extortions. A Frenchman, a man of abandoned charac|ter, named E&s;tienne, commanded it, with the title of Ge|neral. Dumourier threw him into pri&s;on, and publi&s;hed an ordinance, breaking this corps, and forbidding all per|&s;ons to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the name of <HI>Sans-culottes.</HI></P>
<P>He a&s;&s;embled the magi&s;trates of the city. He be&s;ought them before all the people, not to attribute to the French nation, crimes committed only by individuals. He &s;o|lemnly promi&s;ed to puni&s;h the guilty, and to re&s;tore to their families, peaceable citizens, who had been torn from them, under the pretence of &s;erving as ho&s;tages to France. The repre&s;entatives of the people &s;hed tears of gratitude, and cau&s;ed accounts of the&s;e intere&s;ting proceedings to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>General Dumourier i&s;&s;ued a proclamation to authori&s;e the citizens to deliver complaints to the magi&s;trates, re|&s;pecting vexations committed by the French, and em|powering the magi&s;trates to verify and give a legal form to the&s;e complaints. By another proclamation, he prohi|bited the clubs from interfering in public affairs, and by another, he commanded all the &s;acred va&s;es, to be re&s;tored to the churches, enjoining the magi&s;trates and military officers to aid in re&s;toring them.</P>
<P>The&s;e proclamations were printed in both languages, and &s;ent into every part of Belgium. Their effect was immediate. The inhabitants of Grammont wrote to the general, that they laid down their arms. Peace was re|&s;tored between the French and the Belgians. The&s;e wor|thy people forgot the evils they had &s;uffered, and again embraced the French as their brethren and defenders. In|deed it is but ju&s;t to &s;ay, the garri&s;ons had always conduct|ed them&s;elves in a manner no ways di&s;creditable, e&s;pe|cially

in the great cities; and, had it not been for the de|cree of the 15th of December, and the conduct of the a|gents of the executive power, the French character would have been e&s;teemed and beloved in that country.</P>
<P>On the 12th of March, Dumourier wrote a letter to the National Convention, which appeared &s;o deplorably true in its contents, that the Pre&s;ident and committee to which it was referred, did not dare to read it in the Tribune. A copy of the letter &s;tole abroad, and was printed at Ant|werp. In it the general frankly &s;tated to the convention, the mea&s;ures he had been compelled to pur&s;ue in order to &s;ave Belgium and the French army. He referred the Convention, for minute information on each point, to the mini&s;ter, to whom he &s;ent copies of the proclamations, and an account of his proceedings, demanding of him, that he &s;hould produce the whole to the convention, without re&s;erve or di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for the commi&s;&s;ary Petit-Jean, and, a&s;&s;embling all the admini&s;trators of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. he informed them, that he was on the eve of making a great movement, with the army, and in a few days would engage the ene|my; and he made &s;uch arrangements with them as were nece&s;&s;ary to his purpo&s;e. He almo&s;t immediately procu|red provi&s;ions for fifteen days, and prepared his travelling ho&s;pital to attend the army.</P>
<P>The pay-ma&s;ter of the army had retired to Li&s;le, with two millions of Livres in &s;pecie, and the general wrote to the commandant of Li&s;le, to &s;end him back to the army with a &s;trong e&s;cort.</P>
<P>General Dumourier harranged the garri&s;on at Bru&s;&s;els, with &s;uch effect, that the different corps demanded leave to follow him again&s;t the enemy. He departed on the eve|ning of the 12th of March, for Louvain.</P>
<P>Before we enter on the hi&s;tory of the military opera|tions that follow, and that we may not be obliged to in|terrupt them, it wiil be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak here of the vi&s;it which the general received at Louvain from the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the National Convention. When the di&s;|a&s;ter be&s;el the army, Camus, Treilhard, Merlin, and Go&s;|&s;uin, retired to the frontiers of France, while La Croix and Danton, went to Paris. When the former knew of the general's arrival from Holland, they proceeded to Lou|vain to meet him, having mi&s;&s;ed him at Bru&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Camus, and Treilhard complained of the general's pro|clamations, e&s;pecially that which ordered the &s;ilver to be
<PB N="182" REF="026918_0176_0FD26110A9164B98">
re&s;tored to the churches. They told the general that he ought not to have acted with &s;uch precipitation, but have waited their arrival, and that it was beyond the bounds of his authority to interfere with the admini&s;tration of the civil government. The general an&s;wered that the fir&s;t of all duties was that of attending to the public &s;afety; that the convention might be deceived, as indeed they had been, by their emi&s;&s;aries; that the whole weight of the war, the honour of the nation, and the pre&s;ervation of the army, re&s;ted upon him; that for the&s;e he was re&s;pon|&s;ible, not only to his &s;uperiors, but to po&s;terity; that he had undertaken no mea&s;ure incon&s;iderately, but after the mature&s;t deliberation; that, had they been pre&s;ent, he &s;hould not have con&s;ulted them, although he &s;hould have endeavoured to have won them to act with him, in putting an end to the crimes, which had long oppre&s;&s;ed the Bel|gians and di&s;honoured France; and, had they oppo&s;ed his intentions, he would notwith&s;tanding have i&s;&s;ued the pro|clamations.</P>
<P><HI>He appealed particularly to Camus, who was religious, and &s;uper&s;titious, on the proclamation that re&s;pected the churches. He expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e, that a man, who pro&s;e&s;&s;ed a zeal for religion, &s;hould be the advocate of a &s;acrilege committed on a people, whom the French con|&s;idered as allies and friends.</HI> Go to the church of St. Gu|dule, <HI>Dumourier &s;aid to him,</HI> &s;ee the ho&s;t trodden under foot, and wa&s;tea on the pavement; the altars broken: and paintings, the ma&s;ter pieces of art, torn into &s;hreds; and ju&s;tify the&s;e profanations, or rather own the nece&s;&s;ity of puni&s;hing the agents of your criminal orders. If the Con|vention applaud the&s;e crimes, if &s;he have no feeling of their enormity, &s;he is to be pitied; and, &s;till more, my un|happy country. Know, that if my country cannot be &s;aved without the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, I will not commit them. But here the crimes of France are ready to turn upon her|&s;elf; and I &s;erve her in endeavouring to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Camus ob&s;erved the great difficulty there would be in re&s;toring the ve&s;&s;els to the churches, &s;ince they had been broken, to be heaped in Coffers. <HI>No matter,</HI> the general &s;aid; <HI>&s;ince the metal remains, it will not co&s;t us much to have them remade.</HI></P>
<P>Camus and Treilhard per&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying that the gene|ral had failed in re&s;pect and obedience due to the Convention. Merlin and Go&s;&s;uin, more rea&s;onable, acknowleged that the general's conduct had been ju&s;t,
<PB N="183" REF="026918_0177_0FD26146AE208478">
and a violent altercation aro&s;e between the two par|ties. Camus &s;aid, that it was a duty he mu&s;t not de|cline, to report the general's conduct, to the convention. The general exhorted him to do &s;o, and &s;aid that he had already, him&s;elf rendered an account of his conduct. The general produced his letter of the 12th, which be|came a new &s;ubject of contention.</P>
<P>It was during this interview that Camus, the mo&s;t ira&s;|cible of men, &s;aid with an air, partly &s;miling, and partly &s;erious, <HI>General you are accu&s;ed of de&s;igning to become</HI> Cae&s;ar: <HI>and I de&s;ign to become</HI> Brutus. The general an&s;wered, <HI>Dear Camus, neither am I</HI> Cae&s;ar, <HI>or you</HI> Brutus, <HI>and your threat is the be&s;t a&s;&s;urance I have of immortality.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, after three or four hours conver|&s;ation with the general, departed the &s;ame night for Bru&s;|&s;els. Camus was faithful to his promi&s;e. He drew up his report to the Convention, with all the bitterne&s;s of a perfidious and malignant mind; and, thenceforth, he be|came the decided enemy of Dumourier.</P>
<P>The general, on his part, returned to the con&s;ideration of the means left him to repair the faults of his officers, and to re&s;tore vigour to an army that no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit which conducted them in the former campaign.</P>

<P>THE troops appeared to re&s;ume all their courage at the &s;ight of their general. Joy and confidence &s;hone in the eyes of the &s;oldiers. They embraced the general. They called him their father. They di&s;covered &s;hame and &s;orrow for their di&s;grace, and loudly demanded to be led again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>Dumourier reproached them with their want of di&s;ci|pline, but above all with their mi&s;tru&s;t of generals, who, till this fatal di&s;a&s;ter, had conducted them to victory, and who were his &s;cholars and companions. He repre&s;ented to them, that their impatience, their want of &s;ubordination,
<PB N="184" REF="026918_0178_0FD2611252CB4F50">
and the fatal con&s;equences of the&s;e in their retreat, had wre&s;ted the conque&s;t of Holland from his hands, and per|haps had determined the fate of the campaign. They appeared extremely affected by their di&s;grace, and di&s;|po&s;ed to repair their faults, on condition that he would not abandon them, but would in&s;tantly lead them to re|cover their honour.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition greatly aided the general in re&s;toring order to the army. But he was greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Gene|ral Thouvenot, who, with every other military talent, had that al&s;o of conciliating the minds of the &s;oldiery, and in|fu&s;ing order into all the parts of a great army. With great plea&s;ure, Dumourier renders this te&s;timony of the merit of his friend, who may one day become one of the be&s;t generals in France, if he &s;hould return to the &s;er|vice of his country, and prejudice do not prevent his ri|&s;ing to the command.</P>
<P>The army amounted to near forty thou&s;and infantry, and near five thou&s;and hor&s;e; and this was exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;ons of Belgium; of a divi&s;ion of 5000 men (800 of whom were hor&s;e) under the orders of General la Mar|liere; the divi&s;ion of Namur, under General d'Harville, con&s;i&s;ting of 12,000 infantry, and 1500 cavalry; and of the corps of the army employed in the expedition again&s;t Holland, which amounted to 18,000 foot, and 2,000 hor&s;e, after the junction of General de Flers.</P>
<P>The infantry, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixty-two battalions, were formed into four divi&s;ions. The right was formed by General Valence; the centre by the Duke de Chartres, who at that period, was named Egalite; and the left by General Miranda. Each of the&s;e divi&s;ions con&s;i&s;ted of eighteen battalions, and amounted to &s;even thou&s;and men. The re&s;erve con&s;i&s;ting of eight battalions of grenadiers, commanded by General Chancel, was placed under the orders of the Duke de Chartres.</P>
<P>Miranda had under his orders General Miaczin&s;ky, who commanded the left flank of the army, con&s;i&s;ting of two thou&s;and infantry, and one thou&s;and hor&s;e; and Ge|neral Champmorin, who commanded a body of four thou|&s;and foot and one thou&s;and hor&s;e. General Valence had under his orders General Dampierre, who commanded the right flank, con&s;i&s;ting of an equal force with that of General Miaczin&s;ky; and Generel Neuilly, who com|manded a body of three thou&s;and foot and one thou&s;and hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="026918_0179_0FD261452CB6FDB0">
The advanced guard was compo&s;ed of &s;ix thou&s;and men, fifteen hundred of which were hor&s;e, commanded by General la Marche. He was an old officer, who had &s;een a great deal of &s;ervice, and had been an excellent colonel of Hu&s;&s;ars. He was forward to undertake an en|terpri&s;e, but ea&s;ily di&s;couraged. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two excellent officers, although they were very young, who coun&s;elled him with great &s;ucce&s;s, when he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be coun&s;elled. The&s;e were Colonel Montjoye, who was adjutant-general, and Lieutenant-Colonel Barois, who commanded the hor&s;e artillery. But the ill-health of this old general, and &s;till more his want of capacity, rendered him very dangerous.</P>
<P>The rapidity with which in this war, officers ro&s;e to the highe&s;t rank in the army, inverted the order of every thing. The corps and regiments lo&s;t officers that com|manded them with effect, and the army acquired inexpe|rienced generals. Yet the army was really in want of generals. At this period it had no more than five lieu|tenant-generals, and twelve major-generals, &s;ix of which commanded detached corps: &s;o that there were but &s;ix re|maining to command in the line.</P>
<P>When general Dumourier arrived at Louvain, on the morning of the 13th, he found that the three divi&s;ions of his infantry were encamped on the heights behind Lou|vain, having the canal of Malines in front. The re&s;erve, with a &s;mall body of hor&s;e, was at the di&s;tance of two leagues, beyond Bauter&s;em; and the advanced guard at more than two leagues beyond the re&s;erve, at Cumptich, having a &s;mall force of four hundred men in Tirlemont.</P>
<P>The enemy advanced and occupied all the villages between Tirlemont and Tongres. The de&s;ign of the enemy was to turn our right on the 16th; and if that had been executed on the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th or 14th, the advanced guard would have fallen back on the re&s;erve, and the re&s;erve on the main body, and the whole army would have been defeated and di&s;per&s;ed, having no known point at which to rally.</P>
<P>On the 14th Dumourier vi&s;ited his advanced guard; and he in&s;tantly ordered &s;everal movements, by which the po&s;ition of his army was much more firm and &s;ecure. He placed General Dampierre, with the troops under his command, at Hougaerde to the right of Cumptich, and ordered General Neuilly to advance from Judoigne to
<PB N="186" REF="026918_0180_0FD26114669F7F38">
Lummen, in order to &s;trengthen this right wing of the army, and to extend the line beyond that of the enemy.</P>
<P>He commanded General Miaczin&s;ky to take a po&s;ition to the left, between Die&s;t and Tirlemont, on the &s;ide of Halen, and having the river Gette in front of him. He ordered General Champmorin to occupy Die&s;t, with his divi&s;ion. This general, having informed him that Die&s;t was a &s;mall city with walls, which might be made a &s;trong po&s;t, Dumourier ordered him to add as much as po&s;&s;ible to its &s;trength, and to leave in it two battalions and fifty hor&s;e, when he &s;hould receive orders to march forward with his troops.</P>
<P>He commanded General la Marliere to leave a &s;mall body of troops at Aer&s;chette, in order to keep open the communication with Die&s;t; and to proceed with the re&s;t of his troops to Liers to overawe the country of Cam|pine, to check the Pru&s;&s;ian column who might advance in that quarter, and to cover the retreat of the army of Holland, whom Dumourier concluded had abandoned the project of pa&s;&s;ing to Dort, and which indeed was the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ent orders to General de Flers to throw him&s;elf with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch into Breda; to &s;end Colonel Tilly to Gertruydenberg, with the garri&s;ons named in the orders, and to &s;end back the remainder of that army to the lines of Antwerp, to be placed under the orders of General Mara&s;&s;e. Dumourier ordered Colonel We&s;|termann to take po&s;t at Turnhout, with the gendarmerie and the legion of the north, in order to protect this re|treat, to check the enemy in that quarter, and to keep open the communication with General la Marliere, and by his divi&s;ion, with the grand army.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th of March, the advanced guard of the enemy attacked Tirlemont, and the 400 men who were po&s;ted there fell back, without engaging but with a lo&s;s, having &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;ur|pri&s;ed. General Dampierre, accu&s;tomed to retreats, took upon him, on hearing the firing at a di&s;tance, to abandon his po&s;t of Hougaerde, where he guarded one of the pa&s;&s;ages of the Gette, and fell back upon Lou|vain, at the &s;ame time ordering General Neuilly to re|tire on his &s;ide to Judoigne. Dumourier had not time to examine whether it were fear or treachery which cau&s;ed this dangerous movement on his right. Had it been known to the enemy, the French army might have been
<PB N="187" REF="026918_0181_0FD26148F6280F38">
overthrown, Dumourier contented him&s;elf with repair|ing this fault, which was &s;o much the more weighty, as it accu&s;tomed the troops to give way on the fir&s;t appear|ance of danger; and on the &s;ame night he cau&s;ed the&s;e two divi&s;ions to return to their former po&s;ts.</P>
<P>It was very &s;ingular, that on the left General Miac|zin&s;ky committed the &s;ame fault, and withdrew into the wood near Louvain, and was not to be found for two days. But the po&s;ition he had quitted was occupied by the body of troops under General Champmorin, whom the General ordered on the 15th to proceed with the greate&s;t di&s;patch to occupy the heights of Oplinter, on the left of Tirlemont. Champmorin took that po&s;ition on the evening of the 16th.</P>
<P>Fortunately the enemy, who had fixed the 16th for their march, di&s;covered nothing of the retrograde move|ments of the 15th, and were not prepared to profit by them. On the &s;ame day, the General advanced with the whole of his army beyond Bauter&s;em and near to Cump|tich, to prepare for his revenge on the following day, and not to leave the enemy the advantage they had gained. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to take Tirlemont; &s;ince, otherwi&s;e, he mu&s;t have fallen back, and again have &s;ubjected his troops to be di&s;couraged and terrified.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts, with a con&s;iderable advanced guard, occupied Tirlemont, and the &s;pace lying between the two Gettes, from the cau&s;eway of St. Tron, to the ground oppo&s;ite the po&s;t of Hougaerde.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 16th, the General made a vigorous attack upon the Imperiali&s;ts. As the heights of Oplinter commanded the high road of St. Tron, when the General had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Tirle|mont, (which he gained after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance) the Im|periali&s;ts finding their right flanked by the troops under Miranda on the heights of Oplinter, made a precipitate march, to pa&s;s a &s;mall arm of the Gette, to retire to the heights of Neerlanden, Nerwinde, Middlewinde and, Oberwinde.</P>
<P>Between the two Gettes, at a league and a half on the right beyond Tirlemont, was a village named Gotz|enhoven, which commanded the whole plain. It &s;tood on a &s;mall hill; having hedges along the front, and ditches filled with water on the right and in the rear.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts did not appear to perceive the impor|tance of this po&s;t, till Dumourier had &s;ent General la
<PB N="188" REF="026918_0182_0FD261189ABEB9B8">
Marche, with his advanced guard, &s;upported with cannon, to tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on of it. At that time the Imperiali&s;ts were fill in po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on of the two villages of Meer and Hatten|dover and Dumourier cau&s;ed the&s;e to be attacked by his column as quickly as they could form after filing thro' Tirlemont. The Imperiali&s;ts committed a great error in not occupying Gotzenhoven in &s;ufficient force, as that po&s;t might have defended, or might have laid in a&s;hes, the two villages of Meer and Hattendover. The Impe|riali&s;ts collected a &s;trong body of infantry and hor&s;e, to endeavour to di&s;lodge the French from Gotzenhoven. &mdash; They performed prodigies of valour in this attack, al|though without &s;ucce&s;s. The cuira&s;&s;iers charged the French infantry with the greate&s;t intrepidity, even a|mong the very hedges of the village, and their lo&s;s was very great. The attack was recommenced &s;everal times. The enemy attempted in vain to turn Gotzenhoven on the right, for General Neuilly, having pa&s;&s;ed the greater Gette at Dummen, had opportunely arrived in this quar|ter, with his divi&s;ion to take the po&s;ition of Neerhely&s;|&s;en. The engagement did not fini&s;h till four o'clock in the afternoon, when the Imperiali&s;ts were in full retreat. It la&s;ted at lea&s;t eight hours between the advanced guards of the Imperiali&s;ts and the French, which were nearly of equal force, and were both of them &s;upported by the main bodies of their re&s;pective armies. The lo&s;s of the Imperiali&s;ts was much greater than that of the French. The advantage remained with the latter, but they were on the point of lo&s;ing their general at the attack of Gotz|enhoven.</P>
<P>This engagement, which co&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts mere than 1200 men, entirely re&s;tored the courage of the French troops. Dumourier formed his army into two divi&s;ions, extending from Gotzenhoven to the high road, among the villages, which had been the field of battle. &mdash; General Neuilly, &s;tationed near Neerhely&s;&s;en &s;upported the right. General Dampierre, having arrived on the evening of the engagement, was po&s;ted at E&s;emael, in front of the centre. General Miaczin&s;ky arriving with his cavalry (his infantry con&s;i&s;ting of eight battalions being left near Louvain, was po&s;ted at the bridge of the le&s;&s;er Gette, oppo&s;ite to Or&s;mael. A part of the divi|&s;ion of General Miranda remained behind the great Gette, to the left of Tirlemont, extending to Oplinter; at which la&s;t place General Champmorin arrived with his troops during the night.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="026918_0183_0FD22EE5E3EBE088">
After this fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, Dumourier &s;aw that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take a deci&s;ive &s;tep. Troops were continually on their march to reinforce the Imperiali&s;ts, and the French army had very incon&s;iderable or no reinforce|ments to expect. The Imperial cavalry was double the number of that of the French, and in every re&s;pect greatly &s;uperior. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the French to contend with a di&s;ciplined army, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Netherlands, foot by foot; being in want of generals, incapable of executing prompt marches of bold impor|tant manoeuvres, in face of a numerous and experienced cavalry, and having behind them no &s;trong and fortified places.</P>
<P>There was, however, a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;topping the progre&s;s of the enemy, which could not be done without hazarding a battle. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;ound and true prudence called on Dumourier to ri&s;k every thing, before the Prince of Cobourg &s;hould have received the remainder of the reinforcements for which he waited to begin the campaign. The two armies were of equal force. That which &s;hould attack would have the advan|tage in &s;pirit and confidence, which always belong to the party beginning the attack. This advantage had, during fifteen days, been in the hands of the Prince of Co|bourg; but General Dumourier had regained it by the i&s;&s;ue of the engagement of Tirlemont.</P>
<P>If General Dumourier &s;hould have the good fortune to gain a deci&s;ive battle and &s;uch he re&s;olved this to be, his &s;ituation would be entirely changed: for fir&s;t, it would re&s;tore him in the opinion of his army to his former &s;upe|riority, and would intimidate the enemy; &s;econdly, it would have &s;ecured the Belgians in his intere&s;t, and would have greatly forwarded the levies of twenty-five battalions which the nation had undertaken, and &s;o would have &s;trengthened his army by the acqui&s;ition of twenty thou&s;and infantry, at the lea&s;t; thirdly, he would have regained the ground lo&s;t on the &s;ide of Liege, for the Au&s;trians would not have been able to have held that city, nor even Aix-la-chapelle and would have been compelled to have intrenched them&s;elves under the protec|tion of Mae&s;tricht; and la&s;tly, it would have compelled the Prince of Cobourg to have repa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e, and would have &s;o greatly weakened his army, as to prevent his retaking the field before the month of May.</P>

<P>On the contrary, &s;hould the general be defeated, he de&s;igned, in the fir&s;t place, to take a po&s;ition behind the canal of Louvain, in order for a while to cover Bru&s;&s;els, and to reinforce his army; &s;econdly, to maintain the po&s;ition of Namur, rai&s;ing the corps of General d'Har|ville to the amount of 25,000 men, and to place the divi&s;ion of General Neuilly at Judoigne, to coves Dumourier's retreat by the fore&s;t of Soignies, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting Bru&s;&s;els; thirdly, to a&s;&s;emble a body of 25,000 men near Antwerp, and, &s;till holding Breda and Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">truydenberg, to keep the communication open to the&s;e places by means of the po&s;ts of Liers and Die&s;t; fourthly, to a&s;&s;emble a body of 14 or 15,000 men on the &s;ide of Bruges, to cover Maritime Flanders; fiftly, to negotiate with the Imperialists for a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, and mean while to endeavour to convince the troops in the different camps, that their want of &s;ubordi|nation, together with the di&s;a&s;ters re&s;ulting from it, was one effect of the ab&s;urd government of the convention, hat it was high time to put an end to the anarchy which
<PB N="191" REF="026918_0185_0FD261529A7DFF68">
would otherwi&s;e cau&s;e the entire ruin of France, and that on the army alone re&s;ted the hopes and &s;ate of the Country. When the minds of the troops &s;hould have been &s;ufficiently prepared, his next de&s;ign was to rein|force the army with battalions of Belgians, who held the Convention and Jacobins in abhorrence, to declare open|ly in favour of a limited Monarchy, to lay hold of ho&s;ta|ges for the &s;ecurity of the pri&s;oners in the Temple, and to march to Paris.</P>
<P>The&s;e were General Dumourier's objects previous to the battle of Nerwinde, and it will be &s;een how urgent his motives were for ri&s;king a deci&s;ive battle, and for u&s;ing every effort to gain the victory. He never had the ba&s;ene&s;s to wi&s;h to be beaten. He earne&s;tly &s;trove to ma&s;ter events. Although he held the Tyrants of France in dete&s;tation, although he viewed with horror the cruel|ties that di&s;honored France, he was not the le&s;s &s;olicitous to maintain the honor of his country, and to prove him|&s;elf worthy of her confidence. In every ca&s;e, and in every moment till the la&s;t, the end of his mea&s;ures was to prevent a foe from giving law to France, and to &s;ave his country from in&s;ult or injury, and it is this which has drawn upon him the ill founded reproach, from mi&s;|informed per&s;ons, and in particular from the Elector of Cologne, of having changed his party only when he was vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Had he not previous to the lo&s;s of the battle of Ner|winde openly declared his ho&s;tility to the Jacobins by his proclamations at Antwerp and Bru&s;&s;els? Had he not impri&s;oned or driven out of the country the rapacious agents of the Convention? Had he not written his letter of the 12th of March? Had he not compelled the &s;ilver of the churches to be re&s;tored? Had not his corre&s;pond|ence with Pache, Bournonville and Le Brun, (which was printed and which appeared al&s;o in the Monitors of March and April) declared the firme&s;t truths and the free&s;t opinions, re&s;pecting the authors of the mi&s;eries of France. If in tho&s;e he did not &s;peak of the royal family, it was that he feared his mention of them would become a &s;ignal for their death.</P>
<P>He who reads the&s;e Memoirs, and calls to remem|brance the circum&s;tances and the public documents of tho&s;e times, will &s;ee that the opinions of General Du|mourier have been con&s;i&s;tent. He has been the zealous defender of his country. Her enemies have been his

enemies, but the war he has made upon them has been open and generous; for his love of his country was nei|ther fanatical, unju&s;t, nor &s;avage. The Emigrants, by whom he is dete&s;ted as greatly as by the Jacobins, have, on all occa&s;ions, found him humane and liberal. In a war, differing from all others in character, a war of opinion, in which in&s;tability of principles and conduct might find excu&s;e, he has no &s;hifting of opinion where|with to reproach him&s;elf, no perfidy, no cruelty, no in|&s;olence in &s;ucce&s;s, nor weakne&s;s in misfortune and di&s;|grace. In a word, moved only by humanity, he re|&s;tored the Netherlands to the Emperor, as was acknow|ledged by the Archduke Charles, by the Emperor's Mi|ni&s;ters and Generals, by his army, and by the people of the country. Nor did he make conditions or re&s;erves for him&s;elf. He did not demand an a&s;ylum in the Em|peror's dominions.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Battle of Nerwinde.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prince of Cobourg advanced between Ton|gres, St. Tron, and Landen; and the two armies were in &s;ight of each other. General Dumourier pa&s;&s;ed the day of the 17th in reconnoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the po&s;ition of the ene|my, in forming his troops in order of battle, and in pre|paring his plan of attack. He had, in his front, the Le&s;&s;er Gette, which ri&s;es in the town&s;hip of Jaudrain, and runs almo&s;t parallel with the greater Gette, into
<PB N="193" REF="026918_0187_0FD2615430497728">
which it falls below Leaw. This river ran between the two armies. Both &s;ides of the river were extremely hil|ly; and the ground, on the &s;ide occupied by the Impe|riali&s;ts, formed an amphitheatre ri&s;ing from the river to the more elevated &s;ituations of Landen and St. Tron.</P>
<P>Dumourier judged that the po&s;ition of the Prince of Cobourg was by much the &s;tronge&s;t on the &s;ide of Ton|gres and St. Tron; becau&s;e of the nece&s;&s;aty of his draw|ing his provi&s;ions from Mae&s;tricht and Liege; and that con&s;equently his left, which was con&s;iderably extended on the &s;ide of Landen, mu&s;t be more weak, and more liable to be turned, or broken.</P>
<P>Dumourier knew al&s;o, that the Prince of Cobourg had neglected to occupy the little city of Leaw, which was a very important po&s;t, and which might either &s;erve as a centre to the motions of the army making the attack, or a point of re&s;i&s;tance for the army that &s;hould be at|tacked.</P>
<P>In the front of that part of the enemy's line, which extended from Landen towards Leaw, were the three villages of Oberwinde, Middlewinde, and Nerwinde.&mdash; Near Middlewinde was an eminence, called the Tomb of Middlewinde, which commanded the three villages, and a valley which &s;eparates them from the city of Lan|den. He, therefore, who &s;hould occupy this place, mu&s;t be ma&s;ter of all the plain, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in ca&s;e of an attack, repul&s;e his enemy.</P>
<P>On the&s;e facts, Dumourier laid down his plan for the battle, which was as follows: The fir&s;t column, form|ing the right flank of the army, compo&s;ed of the advanced guard, under General la Marche, proceeding by the bridge of Neerhelly&s;len, was to enter the plain between Landen and Oberwinde; and to extend it&s;elf beyond the left of the enemy, in order to harra&s;s that flank. The &s;econd column, compo&s;ed of the infantry of the army of the Ardennes, commanded by Lieutenant-|general le Veneur, and &s;upported by a &s;trong body of cavalry, entering the plain by the &s;ame bridge, was to gain the Tomb of Middlewinde by a rapid movement, and to attack the village of Oberwinde, which could not with&s;tand a di&s;charge of 12 pounders that were to be planted on the Tomb. And while this attack &s;hould take place, the third column under the command of General Neuilly, entering the plain al&s;o by the &s;ame bridg, waes to fall on the right of the village of Nerwinde.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="026918_0188_0FD2611EEBA63D78">
The&s;e three columns formed the right wing of the army, commanded by General Valence, who, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, wheeling to the left, and driving the left wing of the enemy before him, was to continue his march in order of battle, leaving Landen behind him, and having his front facing St. Tron.</P>
<P>The centre, commanded by the Duke de Chartres, was compo&s;ed of two columns. The fir&s;t, (which was the fourth column in the order of attack) commanded by lieutenant-general Dietman, pa&s;&s;ing the river by the bridge of Laer, and rapidly cro&s;&s;ing the village of the &s;ame name, which was only occupied by a few indiffe|rent troops belonging to the Imperiali&s;ts, was to pre&s;s forward, and fall directly upon the front of the village of Nerwinde. The fifth column, commanded by Gen. Dampierre, was to pa&s;s by the bridge of E&s;emael, and to attack the left of Nerwinde. The&s;e two columns were afterward to follow the right wing, forming a dia|gonal line with the point of their departure.</P>
<P>The left wing, under the command of General Mi|randa, was compo&s;ed of three columns. The fir&s;t (be|ing the &s;ixth in the order of attack) under General Mi|aczin&s;ky, pa&s;&s;ing the river at Over-helpen, was to charge &s;traight forward proceeding toward Neerlanden, but be|ing careful never to pre&s;s beyond the head of the fifth column. The &s;eventh column, under General Rualt, was to pa&s;s the river at the bridge of Or&s;mael, and en|gage the enemy by the high road of St. Tron. The eighth column, under Gen. Champmorin, was to pa&s;s the river below Neerlinter, at the bridge of Bingen, and to throw it&s;elf into the Leaw, which it was to occupy till the end of the battle.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of complete &s;ucce&s;s, the army at the end of the action would be ranged in order of battle, with the left wing at Leaw, and the right at St. Tron, and having its front toward Tongres: which was the only point by which the Imperiali&s;ts could retreat. And batteries were erected on the banks of the Gette, within reach of the bridges, to protect the retreat of the columns, in ca&s;e of their being repul&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 18th of March, between &s;even and eight o'clock, the &s;everal columns began to move in the &s;ame in&s;tant, in great order, and pa&s;&s;ed the river without ob&s;tacle. General la Marche committed the fir&s;t error of that day. He entered the plain of Landen ac|cording
<PB N="195" REF="026918_0189_0FD26155AFD12A48">
to his in&s;tructions, but finding no enemy there, he made a movement: to the left, to fall upon the village of Oberwinde, and thence was thrown into confu&s;ion by the &s;econd column. Although the troops of the &s;econd column were retarded in their march by their artillery, yet they attacked the village of Oberwinde, and the Tomb of Midldewinde, with &s;uch vigour, that by ten o'clock they had carried tho&s;e pa&s;ts.&mdash;But General le Veneur did not take &s;ufficient precautions to &s;trengthen him&s;elf in the latter po&s;t.&mdash;It was &s;oon after re-taken by the Au&s;trians, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it di&s;puted the whole day. General Neuilly bri&s;kly en|tered Nerwinde with the third column, and drove out the Imperiali&s;ts; but, almo&s;t immediately abandoning the village, he advanced into the plain toward the &s;econd column. General Neuilly a&s;&s;erted, that he re|ceived an order to that effect from General Valence, who on his &s;ide declared, it was a mi&s;under&s;tanding of Gen. Neuilly.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, the Imperiali&s;ts re-entered Nerwinde; from which they were again driven, by the fourth and fifth columns, under the command of the Duke de Char|tres. In this attack General Desforets, an excellent of|ficer, received a wound in the head with a mu&s;quet-ball. This part of the army fell into confu&s;ion. The infantry crowded in too great numbers into the village, and were in &s;uch complete di&s;order, that on the appearance of a &s;econd attack from the enemy they abandoned the place.</P>
<P>General Dumourier arriving in this moment, cau&s;ed the village to be once more attacked. It was again car|ried; but the troops pre&s;ently quitted the village again, and all the efforts of Gen. Dumourier prevailed no fur|ther than to rally them at a hundred paces from Nerwinde, which was filled with the dead and wounded of the two parties. But the Imperiali&s;ts did not re-enter the vil|lage until the evening.</P>
<P>It was during the di&s;order in this quarter, that the Im|perial cavalry ru&s;hing into the plain between Nerwinde, and Middlewinde, charged the French cavalry; at the head of which was General Valence, who fought with great intrepidity, was wounded, and obliged to retire from the field of battle to Tirlemont. The Imperial hor&s;e were, however, repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter.</P>
<P>While the hor&s;e were thus engaged, another body of cavalry entered the plain on the left of Nerwinde, and
<PB N="196" REF="026918_0190_0FD2612090CD7F98">
threw them&s;elves with great fury upon the infantry of the fourth column. General Thouvenot, who was at the head of that column, opened his ranks to the Imperial hor&s;e, and immediately cau&s;ed the regiment of Deux|ponts to make &s;o timely and well-directed a di&s;charge of grape-&s;hot and mu&s;quetry upon that body of hor&s;e, that almo&s;t the whole of it was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>From that in&s;tant, the fate of the battle &s;eemed deter|mined in favour of the French, on their right and in the centre. The troops were again in perfect order, were full of confidence and courage, and pa&s;&s;ed the night on the field of battle, preparing to complete their victory the following: morning. The Imperiali&s;ts have acknow|ledged that they were on the point of retreating, and that orders had been actually given to their baggage to retire to Tongres.</P>
<P>But it was quite otherwi&s;e with the French troops on the left. The &s;ixth and &s;eventh columns had attacked the enemy with great vigour; but, when they were al|ready ma&s;ters of Or&s;mael, a panic &s;eized upon the batta|lions of Volunteers, and they fled, leaving the troops of the line expo&s;ed. The Imperiali&s;ts, &s;eeing the di&s;order, charged the two columns with their hor&s;e, which put it entirely to the rout. Gui&s;card, Major-general of the artillery, was killed, as well as great numbers of the Aids-de-camp and officers of the &s;taff; and General Ruault and General Ihler were wounded.</P>
<P>Still, however, great opportunity remained of re&s;tor|ing the fortune of the day in that quarter. It was not more than two o'clock in the afternoon, when the co|lumns fled. They repa&s;&s;ed the bridge of Or&s;mael, and were not pur&s;ued further by the Imperiali&s;ts. At that moment, General Miranda was informed, that the eight battalions of Miaczin&s;ky's corps were arrived at Tirle|ment. The&s;e troops were quite fre&s;h, and General Mi|randa might have reinforced him&s;elf, by placing them on the heights of Wommer&s;em, on the &s;ide of the Gette next Tirlemont. But General Miranda, either being di&s;con|certed, or, which is more probable, &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of the right wing, commanded by his rival General Va|lence, he yielded to his re&s;entment, and re&s;olving to &s;a|crifice him, ordered his troops to retrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; and retired be|hind Tirlemont, at more than two leagues di&s;tance from the field of battle. Whatever be the ca&s;e, his conduct was perfidious in &s;ending no advice of his retreat to Ge|neral
<PB N="197" REF="026918_0191_0FD26157488DA2E0">
Dumourier, which expo&s;ed the right and centre of the army to the whole weight of the enemy. But the enemy did not avail them&s;elves of this cowardly retreat; either to cut off the left wing, which they might have compleatly done by continuing the pur&s;uit to Tirlemont, or to renew the attack upon the centre and the right, who&s;e flank was entirely expo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>General Champmorin, who had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Leaw, and had remained in that po&s;ition, till he &s;aw the retreat of General Miranda, did not abandon it till late in the day, when he repa&s;&s;ed the river by the bridge of Bin|gen, which he cut down after him, and returned to his former po&s;ition of Oplinter. And, perhaps, it was owing to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this po&s;t at Leaw, that the Imperiali&s;ts did not pur&s;ue their advantage again&s;t the left wing of the French, on the retreat of Miranda; &s;ince, in that ca&s;e, General Champmorin might have taken their right in flank.</P>
<P>General Dumourier pa&s;&s;ed the whole time of action in regarding the movements of his centre and right wing, in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing order in the different parts that gave way, and en&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter, which was the more e&s;&s;ential, as it was charged with the whole weight of the manoeuvres. At two in the afternoon, he ob&s;erved that the firing on his left, which till then had been very bri&s;k, had cea&s;ed; but he attributed this &s;ilence to &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash; The nature of the ground prevented his &s;eeing the &s;ixth and &s;eventh columns; and, during the firing of the&s;e co|lumns, he could perceive they were advancing forward. He had, therefore, rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that, the enemy, be|ing driven in that quarter, had halted, that they might not over-run the head of the columns on their right. But no circum&s;tances could lead him to conjecture the incredi|ble retreat of General Miranda: and he was, perhaps, happy in being ignorant of it, while he was repairing the di&s;orders of his right and centre.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the day, he ob&s;erved, that &s;everal columns of the Imperiali&s;ts moved from their right to re|inforce their left, which led him to &s;u&s;pect the truth; but, it was as yet only &s;u&s;picion, having received no me&s;&s;age from General Miranda. In this &s;ituation, he pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of the evening before the village of Nerwinde. At length, his &s;u&s;picions, which he had communicated to no other per&s;on than General Thouvenot, were &s;ucceeded
<PB N="198" REF="026918_0192_0FD26121E79529D8">
by the livelie&s;t inquietude. He departed for his left, ac|companied by General Thouvenot, two aids-de-camp, and two dome&s;tics. Arriving at the village of Laer, at ten at night, he was utterly a&s;toni&s;hed to find that it had been abanded by order of General Dampierre, who after conducting him&s;elf with great valour during the engage|ment, had in the clo&s;e of the evening without orders re|pa&s;&s;ed the Gette with his divi&s;ion, and retired to his for|mer po&s;ition at the village of E&s;emael.</P>
<P>General Dumourier, continuing his route, arrived near the bridge of Or&s;mael, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be occupied by Miranda's troops, but found it was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Au&s;trian Hulans, by whom he was on the point of being taken. He turned back; and proceeded, by the high road of Tongres, and Tirlemont: a&s;toni&s;hed with the &s;ilence and &s;olitude that reigned around him, till he arrived within half a league of that city. He then learnt from three or four battalions, that were &s;cattered in di&s;or|der, without cavalry, along the &s;ide of the high road, the di&s;a&s;ter and di&s;grace of his left wing.</P>
<P>In Tirlemont, he found General Miranda writing to his friends with great compo&s;ure. General Valence had al|ready u&s;ed every effort to induce Miranda to return to the attack, a&s;&s;uring him that the French were victorious on their right, and in the centre; and that, by his return, &s;ucce&s;s would be altogether in&s;ured. General Dumourier commanded him, in very &s;evere terms, to a&s;&s;emble his troops immediately, even during the night, and to po&s;t them on the heights of Wommer&s;em, on the high road, and on the bridge of Or&s;mael, as well as that of Neer|helpen, for the purpo&s;e of, at lea&s;t, &s;ecuring the pa&s;&s;age of the Gette, and the retreat of the right and centre, now in the mid&s;t of the enemy's army, with a river behind them.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ate of the battle of Nerwinde; which had been entirely &s;ucce&s;sful on the part of the French, if Ge|neral Miranda, in&s;tead of retreating, on perceiving the fir&s;t di&s;order in his two columns, had lined the Gette with his troops, and had maintained the two bridges of Or&s;|mael and Neerhelpen. This retreat was the more un&s;or|tunate, as the two columns lo&s;t above two thou&s;and men, white the re&s;t of the army did not lo&s;e more than &s;ix hundred men. The French had about three thou&s;and killed or taken, and more than a thou&s;and wounded, and lo&s;t great part of their cannon.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="026918_0193_0FD26158DAFBFD50">
In this engagement faults were committed on both &s;ides. The French did not attack the town of Middlewinde, which was the deci&s;ive point of the action, with &s;ufficient vigour, and afterward abandoned that po&s;t without any vi|&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity. General Neuilly, after the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, put every thing to hazard, by abandoning the village of Nerwinde, on an uncertain order. Miranda, having al|ready made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the village of Or&s;mael, turn|ed the fate of the day, by yielding to the terror of his troops, and commanding a retreat that became an ab&s;olute flight.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts committed &s;everal errors: in not di&s;|puting the pa&s;&s;age of the Gette; in not falling upon the three columns of the right, both in front and in flank, while they were marching forward to the attack, and were ex|po&s;ed to the fire of the villages of Laer, of Nerwinde, Mid|dlewinde, and Oberwinde; in abandoning the elevated and advantageous po&s;t of the tomb of Middlewinde, and in not erecting a battery on it previous to the engage|ment; in neglecting to occupy Leaw, on their right; and, finally, in not having availed them&s;elves of Miran|da's retreat, either in falling upon his troops, or attacking the left flank of the columns belonging to the centre of the French army, that were in the heat of the action be|fore Nerwinde, by the whole of their right wing which no longer had an enemy in front of theirs.</P>

<P>GENERAL DUMOURIER now &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring his retreat. The po&s;t of Leaw, on which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle depended, was abandoned by his troops; and, in the di&s;may which had &s;eized upon the other two columns of his left wing, the mo&s;t he could hope was to lead them back to the banks of the Le&s;&s;er Gette; to induce them to pa&s;s the river, and to return to the field of battle, was impo&s;&s;ible. The&s;e two columns had lo&s;t part of their cannon in the flight; the Generals, and &s;u|perior
<PB N="200" REF="026918_0194_0FD261239FFF2980">
officers of the&s;e troops, were in no condition to undergo a fre&s;h combat; and, independent of the real lo&s;s of the&s;e columns by the &s;word of the enemy, more than 6000 men had de&s;erted, and were on the road to Bru&s;&s;els and France.</P>
<P>Dumourier pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night in giving orders for the retreat of his centre, and right wing, which was then commanded by the Duke de Chartres, who con|ducted him&s;elf with coolne&s;s, courage, and judgment.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts had in truth gained a great victory, but they were not certain of their &s;ituation. They had been &s;o di&s;concerted with the important advantages gained by the right and centre of the French army, that they made no attempt to pur&s;ue their advantage over the left. They &s;aw the French &s;till in order of battle and ready to recom|mence the action, and they really imagined that the le&s;t wing of the French was about to return to its former po|&s;ition. Hence they threw no more ob&s;tacles on the French in their retreat, than the day before on their advancing to the attack.</P>
<P>This retreat was effected in open day-light, the columns repa&s;&s;ing the river in the order in which they advanced, and altogether with the &s;ame &s;teadine&s;s. Dumourier &s;ent General Thouvenot to the right, to receive the columns, and place them in the order of battle from Gotzhenhoven to Hackendower, while he took upon him&s;elf to a&s;&s;emble the columns of the left wing, and to po&s;t them on the heights of Wommer&s;em, and at the bridge of Or&s;mael. The enemy's troops were already ma&s;ter of this bridge; and Dumourier, to prevent their advancing further on the cau&s;eway, &s;ent orders to General Dampierre, po&s;ted at E&s;emael, to make a movement to the left with half of his divi&s;ion, for the purpo&s;e of flanking the cau&s;eway, and to maintain that po&s;ition till the centre &s;hould have repa&s;&s;ed the river, and then to retreat &s;lowly to the new po&s;ition that the troops were taking, with their right at Gotzenhoven, their left at Hackendower, and having the Le&s;&s;er Gette in their front.</P>
<P>This order, completely executed by General Dampierre, pre&s;erved the army from de&s;truction; for the two columns that had fled had acquired &s;uch apathy from the &s;hame of the preceding day, and were &s;o &s;cattered, that it was ten in the morning before Dumourier could form them, &s;o as to march with good order to take po&s;t at Hackendower, on the right and left of the high road.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="026918_0195_0FD2615B0873E508">
The first column of the Imperial army had pa&s;&s;ed the bridge of Or&s;mael, and had already formed with its artil|lery in the heights of Wommer&s;em. But Dumourier could never prevail on his troops to attack that po&s;t, which commanded the ground on which they had formed, altho they were extremely harra&s;&s;ed by the artillery on tho&s;e heights, and &s;u&s;tained this ince&s;&s;ant firing with un&s;haken con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion Dumourier had nearly fallen. His hor&s;e was killed under him by a cannon ball. The rea|dine&s;s with which he recovered from this &s;ituation was the means of preventing new di&s;order, and probably a &s;econd flight which this circum&s;tance was on the point of occa|&s;ioning.</P>
<P>The troops, which in the action of the preceding day, had fled with &s;uch precipitation, now endured the terrible di&s;charge of the Imperiali&s;ts, with great intrepidity. But in this conduct General Dumourier perceived nothing more than a blind ob&s;tinacy, altogether de&s;titute of the daring courage that he wi&s;hed to excite in them. He ex|horted them to charge with bayonets the enemy on the heights of Wommer&s;em, and &s;everal times he put him&s;elf at their head, without being able to make them advance; too happy, indeed in &s;eeing them continue firm in their po&s;ition, which was imminently more dangerous than a vigorous attack on tho&s;e troops, who being &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Imperial army, and having the river in their rear, might have been totally overthrown.</P>
<P>The left wing of the Imperiali&s;ts betrayed the &s;ame di&s;|po&s;ition, occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame cau&s;e, as that of the French. The&s;e troops &s;uffered the right and centre of the French to repa&s;s the river without mole&s;tation, and even to range them&s;elves in order of battle in the po&s;ition of Gotzenhoven, before they could re&s;olve to pa&s;s the river in order to at|tack them. Thus, the whole day pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides in manocuvring, with the exception of &s;ome canonnading and di&s;charge of mu&s;quets, The two armies re&s;ted on their arms, in order of battle, the whole night, very near to each other.</P>
<P>This cool and &s;teady retreat was the more admired by the Imperiali&s;ts, becau&s;e the troops did not fall back more than three quarters of a league, and &s;eemed only to be re|turning in great order to the ground they occupied before the battle. During the evening of the 10th, however, Ge|neral Dumourier perceived by the epathy which pervaded his troops, that, &s;hould he make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d the next morning again&s;t the enemy, he would be in&s;all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly beaten.</P>

There has been no period when the French &s;oldiery could be conducted &s;ucce&s;sfully without great regard being paid to their temper and their feelings; and the importance of this circum&s;tance in conducting them to battle, has been eminently heightened by the revolution, which, hav|ing entirely de&s;troyed military di&s;cipline, has increa&s;ed the force of the intractable and capricious &s;pirit belong|ing to the national character. The active and impetuous di&s;po&s;ition of the French is calculated to carry them for|ward to coque&s;t, and not to pre&s;erve conque&s;ts. A de|fen&s;ive and methodical war does not dimini&s;h their bra|very, but it wearies and contradicts their impatient &s;pirit, When once wearies and di&s;pirited, the French troops be|ing no longer re&s;trained by the &s;everity of military laws, abandon their leaders and their colours, and de&s;ert with|out the lea&s;t thought of the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The troops of the line, &s;till influenced by a remnant of their former military &s;pirit, an attachment to their colours, and the fear of di&s;grace, continued firm, and were yet to be relied on by the General; but the national-guards, compo&s;ing three-fourths of the army, declaring loudly that it was fruitle&s;s to lavi&s;h their lives in Belgium, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that they ought to return and defend their own frontiers, de|parted by whole companies and battalions. To have at|tempted to retain them by force would have been ineffec|tual, as well as dangerous.</P>
<P>No cour&s;e was now left to Dumourier but to retreat with the troops, in good order, for the purpo&s;e of concealing their defections, and to prevent their being ma&s;&s;acred by the Imperiali&s;ts and the pea&s;ants of the country. In this &s;ad condition the General was con&s;trained to pa&s;s the Greater Getto during the night, and to retire to the heights of Cumptich, behind Tirlemont. All his movements for this purpo&s;e, being performed with a preci&s;ion that &s;carce|ly could have been expected from more di&s;ciplined, and even victorious troops, were attended with the greate&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s. The Imperiali&s;ts, deceived by the fires that were carefully kept up, and re&s;trained by the vigour of the rear guard, did not put them&s;elves in motion till the 20th, when they reconnoitred Tirlemont, from which the French had had time to withdraw their magazines. However, General Miaczin&s;ky, who was charged with the evacua|tion of that city, lo&s;t one of his cannon by the precipita|tion of his retreat.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Retreat of the 20th and 21&s;t of March.&mdash;Engagement of Neerwelpe&mdash;La Croix and Danton at Louvain.&mdash;En|gagement of the 22d of March.</HEAD>
<P>DUMOURIER's po&s;ition at Cumptich had the advan|tage of being con&s;iderably elevated above the Gette. In this camp his front faced Tirlemont; his left was &s;ecured by the river Welpe, which turning &s;hort ran upon his rear, by Bauter&s;em and Wertryk; his right, po&s;ted be|hind Hougaerde, was not &s;o well defended. The Gene|ral, however, could not maintain him&s;elf long in this po|&s;ition, nor was it any protection to Louvain if the Impe|riali&s;ts &s;hould pa&s;s by Die&s;t; nor to Bru&s;&s;els if they &s;hould turn by Judoigne. He therefore availed him&s;elf of the 20th of March, while the enemy were before Tirlemont, to pa&s;s the Welpe, and encamp near Bauter&s;em, having his right at Op and Neerwelpe, and his left on the heights and in the woods in front of Zuellenberg.</P>
<P>He &s;ent General Neuilly, with his divi&s;ion increa&s;ed to 6000 men, toward Judoigne, with orders to prevent de|tachments of the Imperiali&s;ts from penetrating on that &s;ide, to watch their motions, and, if they &s;hould appear with a force greatly &s;uperior, to fall back to Bru&s;&s;els by the fore&s;t of Soignies. Dumourier gave General Neuilly in&s;tructions re&s;pecting the means of defending this fore&s;t, and wrote to General Duval, to reinforce Neuilly with as many men as he could &s;pare from the garri&s;on of Bru&s;&s;els, and the new levies which might arrive there. He al&s;o ordered General Duval to arre&s;t the de&s;erters and &s;end them back to his army.</P>
<P>He commanded General d'Harville to place a garri&s;on of 2,500 men in the citadel of Namur, and to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to march with the remainder of his troops, either toward Bru&s;&s;els, or in &s;uch other direction as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary by the motions of General Beaulieu, who was advancing with 8000 or 10,000 men by the route of Huy</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="026918_0198_0FD261956D4CFC20">
Dumourier threw into Die&s;t a garri&s;on, which appear|ed to him to be &s;ufficient; General Champmorin having inaccurately reported this place to be &s;tronger than in fact it was. He po&s;ted General Miaczin&s;ky at the abbey of Gemps, in communication with Die&s;t. He reinforced the garri&s;on of Malines, He &s;ent General Ruault to Ant|werp, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Lieutenant-General Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;e, and to take the command of the army in that quartet, which reinforced by the divi&s;ion of General Marliere, amounted to more than 20,000 men. He recommended to General Ruault to hold the po&s;t of Riers as long as it was po&s;&s;ible, and to fall back within the lines of Antwerp, if the Pru&s;&s;ians and Dutch &s;hould advance upon him in too great force.</P>
<P>On ths &s;ame day, on the 20th of March, a detach|ment of the enemy without cannon, and inferior in num|bers to the garri&s;on of Die&s;t, appearing before that place, the garri&s;on fled in a cowardly manner as far as Malines. But the advanced guard of the Imperiali&s;ts making an at|tack upon the villages of Op and Neerwelpe was repul|&s;ed.</P>
<P>While Dumourier was engaged in repul&s;ing this attack, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, La Croix and Dan|ton, arrived in his camp, but he &s;ent them to Louvain, where he followed them on the evening of that day. They appeared extremely affected with the recent defeat of the army, but in a &s;till greater degree with the de&s;er|tion of the troops; having met at Bru&s;&s;els and in various parts of their route, entire corps returning to France. But, whatever was their concern on the&s;e &s;ubjects, their minds were much more engaged, as they &s;aid, in the execution of the commi&s;&s;ion with which they were charged: to prevail on the general to retract his letter of the 12th of March; which, by its too great frankne&s;s, had &s;tirred up the bittere&s;t re&s;entment of the convention again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Dumourier an&s;wered that he had expre&s;&s;ed no more in his letter than his real &s;entiments; that the di&s;a&s;ters to whichthey were witne&s;s were the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the evils of which he had complained; that he &s;ought only to remedy tho&s;e evils by putting an end to the tyran|ny and inju&s;tice exerci&s;ed in Belgium; that the nece&s;&s;ity which they mu&s;t perceive of his retiring from a country in which he had no means of defence ought to convince them of the prudent tenor of his proclamations, again&s;t which, the convention were prejudiced, only becau&s;e they were mi&s;informed and betrayed; that tho&s;e proclama|tions
<PB N="205" REF="026918_0199_0FD2615CF75FB090">
had induced the pea&s;ants of Belgium to lay down their arms, and had re&s;tored a degree of confidence between the French and Belgians, and were, herefore, the means of &s;aving the troops, who di&s;organized, beaten, di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;pirited, were altogether incapable of defending them&s;elves again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, more numerous than them&s;elves and flu&s;hed with victory, and at the &s;ame time again&s;t the people of the country, &s;hould the re&s;entment of the latter be again excited.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners were con&s;trained to acknowledge the ju&s;tice of the&s;e repre&s;entations; but &s;till continued to in&s;i&s;t on the general's retracting his letter. The gene|ral, after reviewing before them all the &s;ubjects of his complaints, and &s;etting forth in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, the misfortunes that were on the eve of re&s;ulting from the un|wi&s;e and unju&s;t conduct of the convention, made a po&s;i|tive declaration to the commi&s;&s;ioners that he would in no part retract his letter, &s;ince the lo&s;s or the gain of a battle could not effect any change in his principles, opinions or character. The Commi&s;&s;ioners conducted this conference with much addre&s;s and energy, and endeavoured to win Dumourier by the mo&s;t flattering con&s;iderations. At length, after a very long conte&s;t, the general con&s;ented to write a few lines to the pre&s;ident of the convention, in which he reque&s;ted, <HI>that the convention would po&s;tpone their judgement on his letter of the 12th of March, till he &s;hould have an opportunity of &s;ending them an explana|tion of the rea&s;ons of that letter.</HI> The two deputies de|parted with this unimportant declaration.</P>
<P>On the 21, the general being informed of the lo&s;s of Die&s;t, re&s;olved to take a po&s;ition nearer Louvain, le&s;t the enemy, pa&s;&s;ing the canal; &s;hould cut off his communication with Malines, or fall upon Louvain it&s;elf. He po&s;ted the divi&s;ion of General Champmorin on the heights of Pel|lenberg, flanking his le&s;t by that of Miaczin&s;ky, po&s;ted at St. Peter&s;roede: General La Marche with the advanced guard on the heights of Corbec, &s;kirting tHe high road: eighteen battalions of the army of the Ardennes, com|manded by General Le Veneur, on the heights, and in the woods of Mezendael: and the divi&s;ion of General Dampierre at Florival, in communication with General Neuilly's divi&s;ion, which &s;ell back toward Tombeck, at the entrance of the fore&s;t of Soignies.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="026918_0199_0FD2615CF75FB090">
During the&s;e movements, the troops were harra&s;&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts, who cannonaded them the whole day. On the morning of the 22d, the enemy made a general attack on the po&s;ts of Pellenberg, Corbec and the woods of Mazendael. Blierbeck was between the enemy and General Le Veneur, and he had thought proper to occu|py it. A column of Hungarian grenadiers made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of this village but were driven out with great &s;laughter, and with the lo&s;s of two pieces of cannon, by the regiment of Auvergne, commanded by Colonel Dumas. The attack on the advanced guard was le&s;s vi|gorous, but that on the po&s;t of Pellenberg was extremely bloody, General Champmorin defending him&s;elf with equal courage and ability. He received a &s;trong rein|forcement during the attack, and the enemy were unable to make any impre&s;&s;ion on his lines. This action was extremely hot, and la&s;ted the whole day. The Au&s;trian columns &s;uffered great lo&s;s, and were compelled to re|tire.</P>
<P>On the evening preceding this brilliant action, General Dumourier had occa&s;ion to &s;end Colonel Montjoye to the head-quarters of the Prince of Cobourg, to treat re&s;pect|ing the wounded and the pri&s;oners. He then &s;aw Colo|nel Mack, an officer of uncommon merit, who ob&s;erved to Colonel Montjoye, that it might be equally advantage|ous to both pairties to agree to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms. Du|mourier, who had deeply con&s;idered the dangerous &s;itua|tion of his army, &s;ent Montjoye again to Colonel Mack on the 22d, to demand if he would come to Lovain, and make the &s;ame propo&s;ition to Dumourier. Colonel Mack came in the evening. The following articles were ver|bally agreed to; Fir&s;t, that the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould not again attack the French army in great force, nor Ge|neral Dumourier again offer battle to the Imperiali&s;ts. Secondly, that on the faith of this tacit armi&s;tice, the French &s;hould retire to Bru&s;&s;els &s;lowly and in good order, without any oppo&s;ition from the enemy. And la&s;tly that Dumourier and Colonel Mack &s;hould have another inter|view after the evacuation of Bru&s;&s;els, in order to &s;ettle fur|ther articles that might then be mutually deemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This &s;tipulation, the fir&s;t that was entered into between the two generals, became hourly of more importance to Dumourier. His army was greatly dimini&s;hed, e&s;pecially in officers. He had &s;carcely ammunition for a battle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="207" REF="026918_0200_0FD261971AE5A690">
and unfortunately, he was well per&s;uaded that, in ca&s;e of a &s;erious attack, he &s;hould be abandoned by his army.</P>
<P>He had &s;ufficient proof of this on the following day. The Imperiali&s;ts thought them&s;elves &s;o little bound by the articles agreed to by Colonel Mack, that General Clairfait (who was ignorant of the&s;e articles) fell upon the advanced guard and the troops po&s;ted at Pellenberg. The action became general along the whole front of the army. Champmorin defended him&s;elf with the &s;ame ob&s;tinacy as before; but toward the clo&s;e of the action, when the Im|perial infantry were actually retiring, and there was no longer any enemy before the army, excepting &s;ome light troops, old General La Marche became &s;uddenly terrified; and, notwith&s;tanding the intreaties of Montjoye, De Ba|rois, and other officers of di&s;tinction, he retired in great confu&s;ion, fir&s;t to the abbey of Dupar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and afterwards to the other &s;ide of the river Dyle, behind Louvain.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts, who acknowledged a lo&s;s of 700 men, (that is to &s;ay 2000 in both actions) were &s;o much di&s;couraged that they took no advantage of this cowardly retreat, which left a very dangerous interval between Ge|neral Le Veneur and General Champmorin.</P>
<P>General Le Veneur had fought with great vigour du|ring the whole of the action, but, &s;eeing him&s;elf aban|doned by La Marche, he al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed the Dyle, without waiting for any orders, and po&s;ted him&s;elf between Coor|beeck and Heverle.</P>
<P>After the defection of the&s;e two divi&s;ions, Dumourier was compelled to order General Champmorin to abandon Pellenberg, and to retreat al&s;o behind Louvain, pa&s;&s;ing through the city, and by the abbey of Vlierbecke.</P>
<P>General Miaczin&s;ky retired by a bridge on the high roa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Die&s;t, being protected by a battery of cannon placed on the heights above.</P>
<P>Dumourier availed him&s;elf of the&s;e two days, to re|move his wounded, and the flour for his army, in boats, to Malines. Other articles belonging to the troops were thrown into the river; but the confu&s;ion attending the evacuation of Louvain, and the avarice of individuals, cau&s;ed a great quantity of the&s;e articles to fall into the hands of the enemy, who entered Louvain that very evening, as the general retired with the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;t|ing of five battalions, which formed his rear guard.&mdash; The Imperiali&s;ts al&s;o took &s;ome boats laden with wound|ed,
<PB N="208" REF="026918_0201_0FD2615E67B20C60">
which the e&s;cort abandoned on &s;ight of a few hu&s;|&s;ars. The&s;e wounded &s;oldiers were treated with great humanity, notwith&s;tanding the atrocious calumnies of the Jacobins, &s;pread with a de&s;ign of irritating the French troops, and of in&s;tigating them to make war without quarter, and with greater barbarity.</P>
<P>The di&s;graceful retreat of the French from Louvain, is among the in&s;tances that prove how delicate and dan|gerous is the &s;ituation of the generals commanding the French armies. Having determined on their plan of attack or defence, and having given orders for its exe|cution, they will be continually &s;ubject to defeat and ruin, if they have not other plans in re&s;erve to &s;tand in the place of orders ill executed or di&s;obeyed: they can have no reliance on the generals under their command, who are frequently the fir&s;t to give the example of di&s;o|bedience, and &s;ometimes of cowardice: they can never depend for a moment on the real &s;trength or po&s;ition of the corps that are not in their &s;ight, &s;ince officers, as well as men, de&s;ert or change their po&s;ition at plea&s;ure: they have no means of remedying the&s;e ills, &s;ince they dare not puni&s;h, being certain of making mo&s;t dangerous ene|mies of tho&s;e who&s;e faults they do but reprove: they are ever in danger of wanting even food for their troops, be|cau&s;e the ancient &s;y&s;tem of providing nece&s;&s;aries for the army has been changed, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of igno|rant and &s;elfi&s;h men: and, they will &s;eldom dare to haz|ard the great movements that decide the fate of war, with &s;oldiers, who, though pre&s;umptuou&s;ly brave, are de&s;ti|tute of good officers, are ill armed, inexperienced, ea|&s;ily di&s;couraged, mutinous, fond of rea&s;oning, and alto|gether let loo&s;e from military law.</P>
<P>But, if a General be notwith&s;tanding &s;ucce&s;sful, the calumnies of the Journals and Clubs await him, and he is &s;ure of being accu&s;ed before the &s;u&s;picious, blind, and imprudent Convention. If he be unfortunate, the whole weight of re&s;pon&s;ibility is thrown upon him, and he is branded with the name of coward or traitor.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ituation in which the Republic of France places her generals in a war, on which depends, not only the political exi&s;tence of the nation, but the indivi|dual liberty of every citizen. Dumourier has been re|placed by Dampierre, who had the good fortune to be killed in battle; Dampierre by Cu&s;tine, who peri&s;hed on a &s;caffold; the latter by Houchard, who was di&s;graced

<P>THE di&s;order accompanying the retreat from Louvain utterly checked the energy the army had di&s;played in the two preceding combats. Happily, night concealed this univer&s;al defection of the troops from the enemy, who, notwith&s;tanding the verbal &s;tipulations agreed to by Col. Mack, would probably have &s;eized upon this opportunity to de&s;troy or entirely di&s;per&s;e the French army.</P>
<P>Dumourier with great difficulty prevailed on the troops to halt on the heights of Coztenbergue, half way on the road to Bru&s;&s;els. And this new calamity induced him to make an entire change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal corps under his command. He &s;ent an order to General Duval to prepare for the evacuation of Bru&s;&s;els. He re|moved old General la Marche from the command of the
<PB N="210" REF="026918_0204_0FD2619DCE652670">
advanced guard, which he gave to General Vouille. He formed this advanced guard, which was now become the rear-guard, of a &s;trong body of the artillery, of all the cavalry of the army, and of twenty-five battalions, almo&s;t the whole of which were troops of the line. He him&s;elf took po&s;t in this rear guard, which amounted to near 15,000 men, and which indeed might be &s;aid to be his army. The other part of the troops marched under the protection of this cho&s;en body, which behaved in a manner worthy the importance of its &s;tation.</P>
<P>Dumourier e&s;tabli&s;hed his camp under the walls of Bru&s;|&s;els, by the &s;ide of the little river of Woluwe, having his right at San-peters-waluwe, and his left at Vilverde.&mdash; Having taken the precaution of tran&s;porting his park of artillery to Anderlecht, he &s;ent it off on the 23d to Tournay, by the road of Enghien and Ath, keeping only the cannon nece&s;&s;ary for his rear guard.</P>
<P>The Prince of Cobourg, who was ignorant of the de|plorable condition of the French troops, no doubt deem|ed him&s;elf happy in the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, which pro|cured him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Netherlands, without further combat. But re&s;i&s;tance on the part of Dumourier could only have tended to lay wa&s;te the country, without ena|bling him to keep his footing in it. &mdash;Since the Empe|ror Jo&s;eph demoli&s;hed the &s;trong places of tho&s;e Provin|ces, they are de&s;titute of any point that can re&s;i&s;t an in|vading army; a battle gained gives the conqueror fifty leagues of country, or perhaps drives the vanqui&s;hed to the extreme frontier.</P>
<P>The engagements entered into by Colonel Mack were faithfully ob&s;erved by the Prince of Cobourg, who re|mained three days at Louvain, &s;ending only &s;mall de|tachments to hang upon Dumourier's rear guard. The General was therefore at liberty to provide for the &s;afety of Bru&s;&s;els, and of the other great cities through which the French army were compelled to pa&s;s on their retreat. Ju&s;tice and humanity demanded that the Belgians &s;hould not be pillaged, and it was e&s;&s;ential to avoid every means of irritating them. They had pardoned the exce&s;&s;es committed by the French, and had rendered them new &s;ervices, and it was a duty to avoid opening the re|cent wounds of the country, &s;ince in that ca&s;e de&s;pair would have again driven them to arms, and the French, &s;urrounded by the Au&s;trians and Belgians, had been en|tirely &s;aCrificed.</P>

On the 25th, the army pa&s;&s;ed through Bru&s;&s;els, ob|&s;erving the greate&s;t order and good conduct, and pro|ceeded to Hall, from whence the General de&s;igned they &s;hould march in two columns to the frontiers of France. No pillage was committed by the troops, nor were any in&s;ults offered, or reproaches made on either part.

Dumourier reflects on the ju&s;tice they have done him with plea&s;ure, and he would not have been pro&s;cribed, and a fugitive, had he every where found equal ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The General's object now was to provide for the &s;afety of the different detached forces, and to concert &s;uch movements as that their retreat might keep pace with his.</P>
<P>While General Beaulieu was penetrating with &s;even or eight thou&s;and men by Huy, the Prince of Hohenloe was advancing by the province of Luxemburg again&s;t Namur, which was occupied by 15,000 men, under the command of General d'Harville. But this divi&s;ion had been formed at the expence of the garri&s;ons of Givet and Maubeuge; and the Prince of Hohenloe, turning by one of the&s;e places, might make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, and penetrate into France.</P>
<P>Dumourier commanded General d'Harville to leave 2,500 men with provi&s;ions and ammunition in the citadel of Namur; and, dividing the remainder of his troops in two columns, to &s;end one to Givet under the command of Lieutenant-general Bouchet, and to re|tire with the other toward Maubeuge; halting fir&s;t at Charleroy, and afterward po&s;ting him&s;elf on the heights of Niny above Mons. In this po&s;ition General d'Har|ville would cover Maubeuge, la Que&s;noy, Conde and Valenciennes; and, as he would then be reinforced at Mons with the divi&s;ion of General Neuilly, con&s;i&s;ting of 6000 men, his divi&s;ion would be augmented to 12,000 men, be&s;ide the reinforcements daily arriving.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e in&s;tructions, General d'Harville in|formed Dumourier, that he had neither provi&s;ions, ammu|nition
<PB N="212" REF="026918_0206_0FD261A25B0DD7A0">
nor money &s;ufficient to provide for the citadel of Namur &s;carcely for fifteen days order; that he mu&s;t either abandon the citadel or defend it with the whole of his divi&s;ion; and demanded of General Dumourier de|terminate orders in what manner to conduct him&s;elf. With the&s;e di&s;patches from General d'Harville, came al&s;o letters to the &s;ame effect from General Bouchot, and documents from the Commi&s;&s;ary Barneville that ju&s;tfied his &s;tatements.</P>
<P>Dumourier had no need to deliberate upon the orders it was nece&s;&s;ary to give General d'Harville. To leave this divi&s;ion at Namur, was to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of Givet or Maubeuge, both in want of troops, and had either of them fallen into the hands of the enemy, the divi&s;ion of Namur would have been ea&s;ily &s;urrounded; and to leave 2,500 men in the citadel, without money and ammunition, was in effect to deliver them to the Au&s;trians. He therefore ordered General d'Harville entirely to evacuate Namur, and retire in good order to Givet and Maubeuge.</P>
<P>Dumourier con&s;idered the &s;ix battalions po&s;ted in Bre|da, and the three in Gertruydenberg, as lo&s;t, yet their having provi&s;ions for four or five months, and great &s;tore of ammunition, would, he knew, enable them a con&s;ide|rable time to &s;top the progre&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians and Dutch. In order to keep open a communication with this divi|&s;ion of his army, Dumourier &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the citadel of Antwerp, and commanded General Berne|ron to po&s;t him&s;elf in that citadel with 2000 men, and &s;ix months &s;tore of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Dumourier appointed Lieutenant-general Omoran to the command at Dunkirk, and along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the department of the North; and ordered him to repair the lines and &s;orts of the intrenched camp between Dunkirk and Bergues; to form an intrenched camp on Mount Ca&s;&s;el; to go in per&s;on to Courtray to take upon him the command of the army of Holland, and to po&s;t it in the camp of Haerlebecke, having the Scheldt in front.</P>
<P>He &s;ent orders to General Mara&s;&s;e and General Ruault, to make their retreat, pa&s;&s;ing the Scheldt by the extremity of Flanders through Ghent, to the camp of Courtray, or Haerlebecke, while the garri&s;on of Malines &s;hould re|tire to the &s;ame place by Dendermonde along the Scheldt; being careful not to precipitate their retreat, and to cut down the bridges after them.</P>
<P>General Dumourier's de&s;ign was, if he could have held the citadels of Namur and Antwerp, to have formed a
<PB N="213" REF="026918_0207_0FD261656ED866B0">
&s;trong line, without the territory of France, running from the right to the left by Namur, Mons, Tournay, Cour|tray, Antwerp, Breda, and Gertruydenberg. In this &s;i|tuation, if the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms &s;hould have continued, he hoped to have greater influence on the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of order in France. In the ca&s;e of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms being broken, the Imperiali&s;ts finding them&s;elves in the centre of a &s;emicircle, would be compelled to com|mence their attack at the two extremities to proceed with &s;afety, which would turn the campaign into a war of &s;ieges on their part, carried on at the expence of their own ter|ritory. Thus Dumourier would have gained time to re|organi&s;e and reinforce his army: which, having the &s;trong places of France behind it, might have been re&s;to|red to its former confidence.</P>
<P>On this &s;uppo&s;ition Dumourier would have occupied the city of Tournay, and the camp of Antoing; from which place if the enemy had been greatly &s;uperior, he could have retired to a very &s;trong po&s;ition in his former camp of Maulde.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of this plan (which had undergone no other change, than that of the evacuation of the citadel of Na|mur) he marched on the 26th to Enghien, and on the 27th to Ath, while the divi&s;ion of General Neuilly marched to Mons by Hall and Braine.</P>
<P>At Ath, he received orders from the Convention to arre&s;t the colonel of the 73^d regiment of infantry, (who had abandoned the army without orders, taking with him his two battalions, and returned to France,) and al&s;o Ge|neral Miranda. Dumourier executed the order that re|&s;pected General Miranda with regret, &s;ince he was per|&s;uaded, that this rigorous mea&s;ure was le&s;s an act of ju&s;tice than the effect of the hatred of the Jacobins again&s;t Pe|thion and the Girondi&s;ts, who were the friends and pro|tectors of Miranda. This General found means to e&s;|cape the danger in accu&s;ing Dumourier, after his quitting the army; an event which was extremely favourable to Miranda.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day Colonel Mack arrived at Ath; a verbal agreement was again entered into between that of|ficer and Dumourier; but this was in much more formal terms than the former. The colonel began by expre&s;&s;ing the acknowledgments of the Imperiali&s;ts, for the peacea|ble manner in which the retreat of the French troops was conducted, in con&s;equence of the prudence of General
<PB N="214" REF="026918_0208_0FD261A3C0ABE000">
Dumourier's orders; by which means the country was &s;pared the mo&s;t frightful di&s;a&s;ters. On the other hand, he noticed the moderation &s;hewn by the Imperial general, who, while he forbore to harra&s;s the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oops on their retreat, took care, neverthele&s;s, to conceal from both armies the connivance between the two generals.</P>
<P>It was agreed upon by Dumourier, and Colonel Mack, that the French army &s;hould remain &s;ome time longer in the po&s;ition of Mons, Tournay, and Courtray, without be|ing harra&s;&s;ed by the Imperial army; that General Du|mourier, who did not conceal from Colonel Mack his de|&s;ign of marching again&s;t Paris, &s;hould, when their de&s;igns were ripe for execution, regulate the motions of the Im|periali&s;ts, who &s;hould only act as auxiliaries in the execu|tion of their plan; that, in the ca&s;e of Dumourier's ha|ving no need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was to be greatly de&s;ired by both parties, the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould not advance far|ther than the frontier of France, and that the total evacu|ation of Belgium &s;hould be the price of this conde&s;cention; but if Dumourier could not effect the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a limited monarchy, (not a counter-revolution,) he him|&s;elf &s;hould indicate the number and the kind of troops which the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould furni&s;h, to aid in the project, and &s;hould be entirely under Dumourier's direction.</P>
<P>Dumourier made Colonel Mack acquainted with his de&s;ign of marching the following day to Tournay, with the march of General Neuilly to Mons, and of the army of Holland to Courtray.</P>
<P>It was finally decided that in order to combine the ope|rations of the Imperial troops under the Prince of Co|bourg, and tho&s;e under the Prince of Hohenloe, at the time when Dumourier &s;hould march to Paris, Conde &s;hould be put into the hands of the Au&s;trians, as a pledge; that the Au&s;trians &s;hould garri&s;on the town, but without any preten&s;ions to the &s;overeignty, and on the condition that it &s;hould be re&s;tored to France, at the conclu&s;ion of the war, and after an indemnity &s;hould have been &s;ettled by the two parties; but that all the other towns belonging to France, &s;hould, in the ca&s;e of the con&s;titutional party needing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Imperiali&s;ts, receive garri|&s;ons, one half of which &s;hould be French troops, and the other half Imperiali&s;ts, under the orders of the French. General Valence, General Thouvenot, the Duke de Chartres, and Colonel Mountjoye, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this confer|ence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Camp of Tournay.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 28th, Dumourier marched to Tournay, and took the po&s;ition of Antoing, having his advanced guard in Tournay, and the flanking corps of the left, command|ed by General Miackzin&s;ky, on Mount Trinity. He &s;ent General le Veneur with the army of the Ardennes, to occupy the camp of Maulde.</P>
<P>In this was Madame de Sillery, with Mademoi&s;elle d'Orleans, whom the general had never till then &s;een.&mdash; The&s;e ladies had taken up their re&s;idence at Tournay, on the advice which Dumourier had before this given to Lieutenant-General Omoran, who then commanded in the Tournai&s;is; becau&s;e Mademoi&s;elle d'Orleans, who was no more than fifteen years of age, was pro&s;cribed in France by the decree again&s;t the Emigrants. This young Prince&s;s (who as well as her brothers, the Duke de Char|tres, and the Duke Montpen&s;ier, is perfectly well bred, and well informed) is an example of virtue, re&s;ignation and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The Duke de Chartres, who had &s;erved the preceding campaign with di&s;tingui&s;hed valour, and a pure and di&s;|intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, and who had recently di&s;played a degree of courage, and civi&s;m, reflecting honour on the French name, was included in the decree of bani&s;hment, rendered again&s;t the hou&s;e of Bourbon and would have been &s;ubject to the cruele&s;t voxations the moment that he &s;hould enter France.</P>
<P>Dumourier, during the two days that he pa&s;&s;ed at Tour|nay, te&s;tified by every circum&s;tance in his power the live|ly concern that he took in the fate of this unfortunate and amiable prince&s;s. As both &s;he and Madame de Sil|lery were greatly in dread of falling into the hands of the Imperiali&s;ts, becau&s;e of the influence which they &s;up|po&s;ed the emigrants to po&s;&s;e&s;s with Emperor, Du|mourier on his departure from Tournay, cau&s;ed them to be conducted to St. Amand. When the general's pro|tection, far from &s;erving, might have been fatal to tho&s;e
<PB N="2l6" REF="026918_0210_0FD261A5286C4828">
ladies, they accepted of an a&s;ylum in Mons, offered them by the Imperia1 generals. If the virtues of Mademoi&s;elle d'Orleans do not find their recompen&s;e, at lea&s;t, may &s;he find protection from the hands of a beneficent Provi|dence.</P>
<P>While Dumourier remained in the camp of Tournay, he received intelligence, that General Neuilly's divi&s;ion, on ariving at Mons, in&s;tead of encamping on the heights of Nimy, had pillaged the magazines, and afterward fled in total di&s;order (without however, being attacked by the enemy,) to Conde and Valenciennes. The Cavalry on|ly remained with General Neuilly, and Dumourier com|manded him to retreat with tho&s;e to Conde, &s;preading over as much ground on his march as he could between Binche, Roeux, Soignes, and Leu&s;e; carrying off with him the forage, hor&s;es, and carriages, and cutting down the bridges behind him.</P>
<P>The evacuation of Mons rendered Dumourier's &s;itua|tion at Tournay very dangerous, his right being altogether unprotected; but, independent of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, his knowledge of the country made him &s;ecure of his re|treat, which he was unwilling to undertake, till he &s;hould have known what movement was made by his left. He, therefore only took the precaution of commanding Ge|neral d'Harville to confine him&s;elf within the camp of Maubeuge and Givet, in order to prevent the enemy from penetrating on the French territory, on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the 29th of March, three deputies from the Jacobins arrived at Tournay. They introduced them&s;elves to the General by &s;aying, that they bore a commi&s;&s;ion from Le Brun; and, pre&s;enting a letter from that mini&s;ter, con|ceived in vague and uncertain terms; they declared they had communications to make to him re&s;pecting the affairs of Belgium. The&s;e three men were Proly, a contempt|ible adventurer, born at Bru&s;&s;els; Desjardines, a writer of little note, who had formerly been driven from Bru&s;|&s;els; and Pereira, a Portugue&s;e Jew. The fir&s;t of the&s;e we have &s;een was already known to the general; the &s;e|cond called him&s;elf a man of letters, and the third was a furious Jacobin. They were offended that the general refu&s;ed to enter on the &s;ubject of their emba&s;&s;y, before Mademoi&s;elle d'Orleans, to who&s;e apartments they had expre&s;sly come to utter a Philippic again&s;t the general. He made an appointment to meet them at his own quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="026918_0211_0FD261697AEFD460">The conver&s;ation that took place between Dumourier and the&s;e men, is pretty nearly &s;uch as they have report|ed it to be. They agreed with him in his opinion of the imbecility of the convention, and on the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|per&s;ing that a&s;&s;embly, and e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome other legis|lature. After that, they &s;ounded the general re&s;pecting the per&s;ons who &s;hould &s;ucceed the convention in their authority; and one of them ventured to &s;ay, that the Jaco|bins had their pre&s;ident, regi&s;ters, tribunes, orators, as well as the habit of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing or determining great con|cerns; and that therefore, there was no need to look fur|ther. Dumourier, in his u&s;ual &s;incere and deci&s;ive man|ner, utterly rejected this idea; grounding his objection on the immorality, ra&s;hne&s;s, cruelty, and inconguous qualities of that &s;ociety; to which all the misfortunes of France he declared were to be attributed.</P>
<P><HI>Proly &s;aid,</HI> how then will you be able to replace the pre|&s;ent repre&s;entatives of the people, and at the &s;ame time avoid the delays and other defects of the mode of election by primary a&s;&s;emblies? <HI>The general an&s;wered,</HI> no hing is more &s;imple, or more ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed. The patrioti&s;m of the admini&s;trators of the departments and di&s;tricts is, at pre&s;ent, well tried and approved. For this one time, it is but to take all the procureurs-general of the departments and di&s;tricts; and to complete the number by members of the departments and di&s;tricts. The&s;e will form a very com|petent legi&s;lature: they will re-e&s;tabli&s;h the con&s;titution of 1789: all divi&s;ions will be healed in France: the Royali&s;ts will lay down their arms: foreign powers will no longer have any colour for carrying on the war, and France. ha|ving a &s;olid government with which they can treat, will li&s;ten with readine&s;s to terms of peace. For do not you imagine, <HI>the general added,</HI> the Republic can continue to exi&s;t: your crimes and your ignorance have de&s;troyed its po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The&s;e three men made &s;ome objection to the general's propo&s;itions, but they li&s;tened very tranquilly to tho&s;e <HI>bla&s;phemies</HI> of the general, of which they afterward gave &s;o dreadful an account. Desjardines, who proceeded fur|ther than the re&s;t in his addre&s;s and artifice, &s;aid that he &s;hould return to Paris to give an account of his mi&s;&s;ion; and that he hoped &s;oon to &s;ee the general again. They took their leave of Dumourier without mole&s;tation; and certainly, he never thought of arre&s;ting emi&s;&s;aries of &s;uch little con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="2l8" REF="026918_0212_0FD261A76E3DE018">General Dumourier has no doubt that, had he &s;econded their idea of replacing the National Convention by the &s;ociety of Jacobins, he had entirely gained the confidence of that &s;ociety; but he acknowledges that his temper, per|haps too &s;incere in this in&s;tance, robbed him of the po&s;&s;i|bility of &s;eeming to yield to their mea&s;ures. He in&s;tant|ly perceived that he could not turn this in&s;trument to his purpo&s;es, but by plunging into a &s;eries of horrid crimes: and the events that have &s;ucceeded, have proved to him that his judgment was not erroneous.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, he received a letter from the &s;even commi&s;&s;ioners of the convention, met at Li&s;le, who com|manded him to appear in that city, to an&s;wer to the charges alledged again&s;t him. He an&s;wered, that being in &s;ight of the enemy, employed in re-organizing his army, and in re&s;toring its courage, (which was indeed true) he could not quit the army for an in&s;tant; but if the commi&s;&s;ioners would come to him at Tournay, he would an&s;wer every accu&s;ation with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s; that When he &s;hould have accompli&s;hed his retreat, and the ar|my &s;hould be &s;afe in the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ritory, he would have more lei&s;ure to take into con&s;ideration his per&s;onal affairs; in a word, that he would never enter Li&s;le, excepting it &s;hould be with troops to puni&s;h cowards, who had aban|doned their colours and calumniated the mo&s;t intrepid de|fenders of their country.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Retreat to the Camp of Maulde.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL DUMOURIER was extremely unea&s;y re&s;pecting the fate of the troops at Antwerp; having re|ceived no intelligence from that quarter, and fearing in|deed, that General Rualt who bore his orders to General Mara&s;&s;e, had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>The retreat from Antwerp acro&s;s the Scheldt, by the extremity of Flanders, was long and difficult. But Du|mourier knew that the enemy were le&s;s numerous in that quarter than the troops at Antwerp. The Pru&s;&s;ians and Dutch were before Gortruydenberg and Breda; and Co|lonel
<PB N="219" REF="026918_0213_0FD2616AD1E8E660">
Mylius, who pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Antwerp had not more than 2000 men, and tho&s;e were irregular troops of the Imperial army.</P>
<P>But the French troops at Antwerp had fallen into &s;till greater di&s;order than any other part of the army. They were &s;eized with panic, and the generals were no longer ma&s;ters of them. On the 26th, Colonel Mylius had the audacity to &s;ummon the city. Part of the French troops had already cro&s;&s;ed the Scheldt, but, in&s;tead of waiting for the remainder, they precipitately retired by Bruges to Dunkirk, excepting a &s;mall body of them, which Colonel Thouvenot prevailed upon to halt at Ghent. General Mara&s;&s;e had &s;unk the Ariel frig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to according to Dumou|rier's in&s;tructions, after &s;ending away her ma&s;ts, rigging and guns, by the canals to Dunkirk. He had al&s;o &s;ent away part of the magazines of the garri&s;on, but a great part &s;till remained, and more than 8000 men.</P>
<P>As the terror and confu&s;ion which before had &s;pread among the troops redoubled on the approach of Colonel Mylius, a council of war was held, in which it was unanimou&s;ly decided, that it was more prudent to &s;ave this part of the army together with the magazines and other effects belonging to the French nation, than ob&s;ti|nately to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of the whole.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for Dumourier to form a candid judg|ment of this capitulation, &s;ince the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of important events that followed, prevented him from any perfect knowledge of the circum&s;tances of the garri&s;on. The Imperiali&s;ts are extremely dextrous in the di&s;po&s;ition and conduct of their advanced guards, multiplying them to the eyes of an enemy, and mi&s;leading the enemy re&s;pecting their real force. It is al&s;o to be pre&s;umed, that the French generals, embar|ra&s;&s;ed and di&s;concerted by the di&s;order prevailing among the troops, imagined the whole Pru&s;&s;ian and Dutch army to be before the place. No excu&s;e, however, is to be made for their having &s;urrendered the citadel, which was altogether independent of the city, and in no one ca&s;e ought to have been included in that capitula|tion.</P>
<P>On the 27th or 28th of March, the French troops quitted Antwerp. None of them pa&s;&s;ed by Courtray, and they were not at liberty to encamp at Haerlebeck, as had been de&s;igned. They entered the French territory in different bodies, and at different times, and part of
<PB N="220" REF="026918_0214_0FD261A8E6910048">
them were di&s;po&s;ed of by General Omoran in the camp of Ca&s;&s;el and the lines of Dunkirk, and the remain|der helped to form the camp of Madelaine, near Li&s;le.</P>
<P>It was not till the 29th that Dumourier received intel|ligence of this di&s;per&s;ion of more than 20,000 men of his army, and even then his intelligence was unaccompa|nied by any detail. The di&s;per&s;ion of the body of troops under Neuilly, and the evacuation of Mons, had expo&s;ed his right, and that of Courtray now expo&s;ed his left to &s;till greater danger, which the enemy might turn, ap|proaching by the left of the Sehelt, and if he &s;hould be compelled to retreat before the enemy in the pre&s;ent di&s;|po&s;ition of his troops, he had nothing to expect but to be completely routed.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he re&s;olved to rai&s;e the camp of Tournay in the morning of the 30th. He and before this, &s;ent General le Veneur to occupy that of Maulde. He &s;ent the army of the North, by the bridge of Mortagne, to encamp in the &s;trong po&s;ition of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, which he ordered to be joined by three bridges to the camp. He &s;ent General Miaczin&s;ky with 4000 men to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">upy O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> chies, to &s;ecure a communication with Li&s;le, and he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head quarters with his park of artillery at St. Amand.</P>
<P>By the unexpected &s;urrender of the citadel of Ant|werp, the garri&s;ons of Breda and Gertruydenberg Were entirely cut off from all communication with the army. They amounted to near 6000 men, that were on the point of being &s;acrificed without the hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and without any &s;ervice to en&s;ue to France. Dumourier, therefore, &s;ent orders, through the medium of Colonel Mack, to General de Flers, and to Colonel Tilly, who commanded in tho&s;e two places to capitulate, on condi|tion of being at liberty to maro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to France with arms and baggage. This was accordingly done; and was an important &s;ervice rendered France, &s;ince one half of the army had already de&s;erted.</P>
<P>At this period the &s;afety of the frontier towns in France was entirely owing to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms; for had the Imperiali&s;ts pre&s;&s;ed forward, &s;uch was the di&s;order prevailing in the French army, they mu&s;t have penetra|ted the frontiers.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this chaos of things, and of the di&s;con|tents and di&s;orders that re&s;ulted in the French army, the
<PB N="221" REF="026918_0215_0FD2616C28E617C0">
troops never cea&s;ed to expre&s;s an attachment to their general, rendering ju&s;tice to his efforts to pre&s;erve them from ruin. The rear guard, and the troops of the line e&s;pecially, who had always &s;een him the la&s;t in every retreat, in the day or at night, and always expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t danger, were moved with re&s;pect, and even compa&s;&s;ion for the general, and with extreme re&s;entment again&s;t his enemies, the Jacobins and the National Con|vention. A wi&s;h for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a limited Monarchy was almo&s;t general in the army. A few of the battalions of volunteers only dared openly to e&s;pou&s;e the Republic. The cavalry, and the troops of the line were altogether decided; and the artillery declared that in every ca&s;e, they would defend their general. It was openly propo&s;ed to march to Paris, and to overthrow the Anarchi&s;ts, to whom the army ju&s;tly attributed the whole of their di&s;grace and misfortunes. It beeing &s;aid that the general was to be commanded to appear at the bar of the National Convention, their con&s;tant language was, that they them&s;elves would conduct the general to Paris, and would &s;hare his fortunes.</P>
<P>Dumourier attentively ob&s;erved this di&s;po&s;ition in the troops, which he &s;aw was &s;upported by the complaints of the generals, and of the greater part of the other officers. The&s;e latter, &s;eeing the generals under whom they had been conducted to victory, outraged in the Jacobin Jour|nals, accu&s;ed of treachery, arre&s;ted, and treated without regard to decency or ju&s;tice, naturally concluded, that their own elevation to the &s;uperior ranks, would but expo&s;e them to the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ters. Some of the generals, however, among whom was Dampierre, kept up a per|fidious corre&s;pondence with the leaders of the Anarchi&s;ts; and, hoping to &s;upplant their &s;uperiors, by the aid of the pre&s;ent di&s;orders, they loudly proclaimed the &s;ame doc|trines as their colleagues of Paris, and by their fal&s;e in&s;inuations kept alive the Jacobin phrenzy that infected part of the army.</P>
<P>The two parties were now in the greate&s;t fermentation, and the conte&s;t tended to an i&s;&s;ue which could not but be prompt and violent. Three Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Con|vention, Lequinio, Cochon, and Bellegarde were in Valenciennes; the&s;e already treated the army and its generals as rebels, would not permit any communication between them and the garri&s;on, and &s;topt their convoys
<PB N="222" REF="026918_0216_0FD261B0B1C7E968">
of provi&s;ion and money. They were bold enough to hazard a manife&s;to again&s;t Dumourier, which they &s;ent to the army, and the garri&s;on of Conde.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of Conde, con&s;i&s;ting of four battalions and a regiment of cavalry, under General Neuilly, were extremely divided in opinion, but they &s;eemed to incline to &s;upport Dumourier, to whom General Neuilly was a1together attached.</P>
<P>At Li&s;le the conte&s;t was &s;till more marked and more violent. The Comi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, who had made this place their point of union, and the Jacobin Club in&s;tigated an extremely numerous populace again&s;t the higher rank of citizens. On the other hand the &s;oldiers, e&s;pecially the troops of the line, broke our into tumults, and &s;poke loudly in behalf of their gene|ral, and again&s;t the Anarchi&s;ts. But they were without leaders, and their mea&s;ures were void of plan and con|duct. A&s;fignats were al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;tributed among the&s;e troops, and the &s;ame means were employed in the army under the general's immediate command, and even with tho&s;e neare&s;t to his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention al&s;o endeavour|ed to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. On the 31&s;t of March, fix volunteers, of the third battalion of La Marne, demanded leave to &s;peak to the general, who ordered them to be introduced. They entered with their hats on, the back part being placed in the front, having the word <HI>Republic</HI> chalked on them. They made a long and fanatical harangue to the general, the purport of which was, that they, and many others of their comrades, had &s;worn to send him to the bar of the National Con|vention, or, in imitation of Brutus, to &s;tab him. Dumourier an&s;wered with great compo&s;ure and gentle|ne&s;s, that they were blinded by a mi&s;taken zeal; that they could not, but perceive the unfortunate condition of France; and that the rage with which remedies were applied, &s;erved only to prove the impo&s;&s;ibility of main|taining the republic, &s;ince an unjust and unre&s;trained government could not long exi&s;t. While the general &s;poke, they approached with a de&s;ign of &s;urrounding him, which, perhaps, would have been effected, but for the intrepidity of the faithfull Bapti&s;te, who &s;eized upon the foremo&s;t, and called the general's guard to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ante. The volunteers attempted to re&s;i&s;t, but they were
<PB N="223" REF="026918_0217_0FD2616FAF027068">
overpowered; and the general not only &s;aved their lives but prevented their being ill treated. He contented him&s;elf with &s;ecuring their per&s;ons in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The indiguation of the army was general; and on the &s;ame day the different corps pre&s;ented adre&s;&s;es &s;igned by individuals of every rank, pro&s;e&s;&s;ing an inviolable attachment to their general; and the greator part of them expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ire of marching to Paris to re|e&s;tabli&s;h the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>After ho&s;tilities had been thus commenced by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, and after the troops had thus declared their wi&s;hes, Dumourier &s;et about the means of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Valenciennes, Conde, and Li&s;le; without which he could &s;trike no blow of impor|tance.</P>
<P>He now readily acknowledges that, although he did not for a moment lo&s;e &s;ight of his object, he failed in ne|glecting means which, doubtle&s;s were nece&s;&s;ary at that period; but which he was induced to reject by his aver|&s;ion to per&s;idy and cruelty. He relied too confidently on the &s;trength of his legitimate means, and on the good &s;aith and conviction of his troops; and he neither coun|teracted his enemies by corruption, nor de&s;troyed the more inveterate of them when it was in his power. A mea&s;ure was propo&s;ed to him that was probably e&s;&s;ential to his in|tere&s;t. It was to a&s;&s;emble the troops of the line in a camp apart from the re&s;t and to di&s;arm and di&s;band the national guard. But this could not be accompli&s;hed without a dreadful effu&s;ion of blood; for there had long exi&s;ted an extreme animo&s;ity between the national guards, and the troops of the line. There were many of the battalions of national guards, who had &s;erved under his command with great valour, and had lately pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to him, couched in loyal and &s;trong turms; and he could not prevail on him&s;elf to recompence them with di&s;grace, or perhaps, with death. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hould make excep|tions in the execution of the plan tho&s;e might include di&s;gui&s;ed anarchi&s;ts; and he could no longer rely with &s;afety on his troops.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory pre&s;ents no example of opinion having agita|ted the pa&s;&s;ions of men to &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a degree, of having &s;o greatly disfigured their characters, and having &s;o com|pletely bereaved them of all the &s;ocial affections, as in the French revolution.

pa&s;&s;ion in 1789. It became licentious in 1790 and 1791. By the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the year 1792, the love of freedom, in&s;tead of being exalted into heroi&s;m, degenerated into a blind, in&s;olent, and barbarous phrenzy; and the period that we are reviewing in the&s;e memoirs added to the fero|city of its &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;truggle for a&s;cendancy was not equal between Dumourier and the Jacobins. His means were enfeebled by his &s;cruples. The crimes of the Jacobins were not to be cru&s;hed but by crimes more incredible than the&s;e; corruption was to be oppo&s;ed by corruption, and treachery and cruelty to the attrocities and horrors of the Jacobins. The &s;ect of the Jacobins was not to be annihilated but by a mon&s;ter more frightful than it&s;elf; or by a foreign &s;word. And hence the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory is no more than an account of the mi&s;takes of Dumourier; who em|braced the incompatible de&s;igns of pre&s;erving his own e&s;teem, and purging the nation of her crimes. In a con|ver&s;ation he had formerly held at Louvain with Danton and La Croix, on a propo&s;al made by tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners relative to a conduct they wi&s;hed the general to adopt in Belgium, by no means very reputable; the general ob|&s;erved (and he has &s;ince repeated the ob&s;ervation to Ca|mus) that he would never commit an action which he re|garded as a crime, even for the &s;alvation of his country. He has &s;ince been told that Danton &s;aid <HI>General Dumou|rier wants energy; his mind has never ri&s;en to the true revolutionary pitch.</HI> The revolutionary pitch <HI>ro&s;e</HI> after that period; and, Dumourier, who has not changed, could not but fail in the &s;truggle, &s;ince to &s;ucceed it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;play crimes greater than tho&s;e with which he had to combat.</P>
<P>Dumourier &s;ent orders to General Miaczin&s;ky, who was at Orchies, to march with his divi&s;ion to Li&s;le; to arre&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, and the leaders of the clubs; to proceed from thence to Douay and remove General Moreton from the command of that town; to pro|claim there and at Li&s;le the unanimous re&s;olution of the army to re&s;tore the Con&s;titution: and a&s;terward to pro|ceed by Cambray to Peronne, where he was to take po&s;t. This unfortunate General did not &s;ufficiently perceive the importance of his charge. He &s;poke of it to various per&s;ons, and among the re&s;t to St. George, the celebrated Mulatto, Colonel of a regiment of Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, who betrayed the general and drew him into Li&s;le with a very &s;mall e&s;|cort.
<PB N="225" REF="026918_0219_0FD261718585A688">
The moment Miaczin&s;ky entered the town, the gates were &s;hut upon him. He was arre&s;ted, conducted to Paris, and brought to the &s;caffold. This officer was a native of Poland, and was one of the chiefs of the confede|ration, at the time that Dumourier was charged by the court of France to direct its operations, Miaczin&s;ky had been made pri&s;oner in an engagement with the Ru&s;&s;ians; and afterward, claiming an indemnity from France, in which the general could not find means to &s;erve him, he had obtained for him the rank of major-general, and per|mi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e a free corps, and had afterward employed him with great utility in France and the army. Miac|zin&s;ky, brave in war, did not di&s;play the &s;ame courage in his per&s;onal defence when he was taken, nor at his death. He accused Dumourier of various crimes again&s;t the nation; and even of &s;ome g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s frauds, that were no doubt &s;ugge&s;ted to him by the enemies of Dumourier. He al&s;o accu&s;ed La Croix, which was the cau&s;e of his ruin.</P>
<P>Miaczin&s;ky's troops, after they were quitted by that officer, wandered on the Glacis of Li&s;le, into which place the garri&s;on would not admit them. Dumourier, re|ceiving intelligence of this, &s;ent one of his aids-de-camp, Colonel Philip de Vaux, to put him&s;elf at their head, and to conduct them to Orchies and Douay. De Vaux was arre&s;ted through the treachery of a brother officer, taken to Paris, and executed. He died with great courage and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Philip de Vaux was born at Bru&s;&s;els, had &s;erved in Au|&s;tria, and had afterward taken part again&s;t the Emperor in the revolution of his own country. Dumourier had known him at Paris, and appointed him his aid-de-camp. He was a man of capacity, of great courage, and of an exalted and feeling mind. In fine, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the qua|lities nece&s;&s;ary to make a general officer.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of Valenciennes was commanded by Ma|jor-General Ferrand, whom Dumourier had rai&s;ed to the rank of Colonel, and afterward to that of major-general; and whom he believed to be attached to his intere&s;ts. This officer was of an age not very liable to be heated with opinions; and, till this period, had appeared to be well informed and moderate. But characters moulder away before opinions, and Ferrand became one of the mo&s;t in|temperate of Dumouriers accu&s;ers, and one of the firmo&s;t &s;upporters of the anarchi&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="026918_0220_0FD261B50D19AB10">
The grand provo&s;t of the army, name&s;t l'Ecuyer, de|manded of Dumourier as a favour, the charge of arre&s;ting the Deputies at Valenciennes. He was no &s;ooner in that city, than he became their confident, and in&s;trument: al|though by a &s;trange accident he peri&s;hed afterward on the &s;caffold. While he was in Valenciennes, he had written a circum&s;tantial letter to the general, re&s;pecting the ar|rangements he had made for arre&s;ting the deputies, and this letter was found in the pocket of the general's great|coat on the 4th of April.</P>
<P>The&s;e two men, Ferrand and l'Ecuyer, undermined the general's plan for making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Valenciennes; the&s;e being at fir&s;t confidentially communicated to them; and they effected an entire change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the troops which he had contrived to &s;end there.</P>
<P>Dumourier's de&s;ign. Li&s;te and Valenciennes, being thus &s;uddenly defeated, he had no other re&s;ource than to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Conde. The &s;ituation of the ar|my, on the extreme frontier of France, was become alto|gether embarra&s;&s;ing. The army depending upon the &s;trong towns for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, Dumourier was compelled ei|ther to di&s;band them, or to join the Imperiali&s;ts, unle&s;s he could obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the &s;trong towns. The fir&s;t of the&s;e mea&s;ures would have deprived him of all re|&s;ource, and given a deci&s;ive victory to the anarchi&s;ts. The &s;econd was repugnant to the feelings of the general, and the troops, in&s;pired by the laudable principle of national honour; and he could not have obtained the univer&s;al con&s;ent of his army to this mea&s;ure, &s;ince the opinions of the troops were divided, and &s;ince the indefatigable in|trigues of the Jacobins had wrought &s;uch a change in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oldiery. And the latter was impracti|cable, becau&s;e the General had no artillery to undertake a &s;iege; his artillery being &s;ent to Li&s;le when he retreated from Belgium. The third of the&s;e mea&s;ures al&s;o, mu&s;t have produced a civil war. A regular &s;iege would have demanded great length of time, during which the &s;oldiery would have made the &s;ame reflections that operated on the mind of Dumourier, and which continually re&s;trained him in the plans that &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to his object: the&s;e reflections regarded the horror of &s;eeing Frenchmen com|bat each other, having foreigners for &s;pectators, to whom both parties would have become a prey, when they &s;hould be mutually incapable of further re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="026918_0221_0FD26172F2595FB0">
Dumourier therefore thought of leading his army to Pa|ris. But he could &s;ucceed in that, only in having a ma|jority of opinions with him. Every other expedient was at once painful and uncertain, Every day, every hour di|mini&s;hed his hope. He beheld his &s;ituation, without de|ceiving him&s;elf, and being &s;ubdued by his difficulties. He regarded them under every a&s;pect, and he cannot now re|collect the fir&s;t five days of April without horror.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Arre&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, Camus, La Marque, Bancal, and Quinette; and of Beurnonville, Mini&s;ter of War.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fir&s;t of April, General Dumourier, in order to be nearer his army, and to favour a project of &s;urpri&s;ing Valenciennes, (which had been propo&s;ed to him, and which failed by the mi&s;conduct of the general officer who was charged with its execution,) removed his head quar|ters from the city of St. Amand to the &s;uburbs; where was &s;tationed a cho&s;en body of cavalry, and where he was al&s;o nearer Conde. Various circum&s;tances had prevented his proceeding in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the latter city, but in that neglect he committed a great error, and perhaps it was the cau&s;e of compleating the ruin of his affairs. Per|haps it had been better if he had at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters at Conde; but the events that pa&s;&s;ed in that pe|riod were &s;o &s;udden and unfore&s;een, he was &s;o effectually &s;hut out from intelligence, and was &s;o compleatly igno|rant of all that pa&s;&s;ed beyond Valenciennes and Li&s;le, and he was &s;o entirely occupied in ob&s;erving and moulding to his purpo&s;e the di&s;po&s;itions of his army, that to blame or ju&s;tify the conduct into which he was driven by this &s;trong chain of circum&s;tances, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have been in his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Perhaps even it is well for him that he did not make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of Conde, for if the incon&s;tancy of the French character had then cau&s;ed a &s;trong defection in his army, being in the centre of that &s;trong city, he had been de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vered up to his enemies, or ma&s;&s;acred by his own troops.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="026918_0222_0FD261B6AFFF6250">
The commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention availed them&s;elves of Dumourier's he&s;itation in this re&s;pect to vi&s;it Conde, and to i&s;&s;ue proclamations, circulate a&s;&s;ignats, and fill the town with emi&s;&s;aries of the Jacobins, The &s;ixth regiment of infantry, the only corps of troops of the line which had di&s;covered a decided &s;pirit of Jacobini&s;m, and a battalion of National Guards of Ver&s;ailles, &s;truck terror into the mind of General Neuilly, who thenceforward was no longer ma&s;ter of the place; although he per&s;uaded him|&s;elf that he was, and continued to a&s;&s;ert it to Dumourier, who too long relied on his ill founded confidence.</P>
<P>In this battalion of Ver&s;ailles, was a captain of the artillery company, named Le Cointre, &s;on of the cele|brated deputy of that name of Ver&s;ailles. This young man declaimed vehemently again&s;t the advocates of the con&s;titution; and, being rudely handled on that account by &s;ome dragoon officers, he quitted the garri&s;on to lay his complaints before Dumourier, who cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted, that he might have an ho&s;tage for him&s;elf, in the per&s;on of the &s;on of one of the mo&s;t furious among the members of the <HI>Mountain.</HI> Dumourier al&s;o cau&s;ed to be arre&s;ted a lieutenant-colonel, an officer belonging to the &s;taff of the army, who declaimed openly and ve|hemently again&s;t him: and having no &s;ecure place in which he could keep the&s;e pri&s;oners, he &s;ent them toge|ther with the &s;ix volunteers, who had attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, to Tournay; reque&s;ting General Clair|fait to keep them as ho&s;tages in the citadel.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-General le Veneur, who at the time of La Fayette's de&s;ertion had followed that officer, and who was indebted to Dumourier for his pardon, and his re|e&s;tabli&s;hment in his rank, now came to Dumourier to demand permi&s;&s;ion to retire from the army, on the pretence of being in an ill &s;tate of health. His object was, to ob|tain the command of the army of the Anarchi&s;ts. Du|mourier granted him permi&s;&s;ion to retire, and al&s;o to a general named Stetenhoffen, a foreigner whom Dumou|rier had made major-general. Dampierre was at Que&s;|noy with his divi&s;ion, and carried on a treaty with the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, as did al&s;o General Chancel, who was cantoned at Fre&s;nes. And their example was followed by General Ro&s;iers, and General Kermorvan, who had the command of the Belgians in the camp of Bruille.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="026918_0223_0FD26176B7EADD78">
Dumourier was the more affected by the&s;e in&s;tances of treachery, becau&s;e all tho&s;e officers had been indebted to him for their rank, had complained more loudly than any others again&s;t the Anarchi&s;ts, and had pre&s;&s;ed with more &s;eeming impatience the execution of his de&s;ign of re&s;toring order. Excepting Dampierre who died in the command of the army, and Chancel who replaced Neuilly at Conde, and was obliged to &s;urrender after a long &s;iege, the&s;e officers have been puni&s;hed for their in|gratitude, by the &s;u&s;picions and di&s;dain of their patrons, and the lo&s;s of their employments. This unhappy ex|ample of treachery of &s;uperior officers, who were in appearance mo&s;t attached to the cau&s;e of the general, could not fail to produce a pernicious effect on the &s;oldiery, and add &s;trength to the party of the Jacobins.</P>
<P>Dumourier now &s;aw that he could no longer hope to march to Paris without oppo&s;ition from his army, as the temper of his troops at fir&s;t &s;eemed to promi&s;e. He &s;aw that he would have to commence by a civil war, which he had always thought of with repugnance; and to com|pel one part of his troops to combat the other, a dreadful extremity for a general who regarded his &s;oldiers as his children, and who had never conducted them but by his kindne&s;s, and the influence of a mutual affec|tion.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance rendered him timid, and de|prived all his mea&s;ures of energy. This was, the danger of the pri&s;oners in the temple. It was to be feared that the Jacobins would in&s;tantly &s;acrifice the unfortunate victims, whom they already treated too unworthily to afford any hope that they would &s;pare them in the fir&s;t moments of their fear and re&s;entment. Had tho&s;e pri|&s;oners been &s;acrificed in con&s;equence of Dumourier's march to Paris, he would have incurred the reproaches of Europe, and hi&s;tory would have con&s;igned him to infamy; while he would have prepared for him&s;elf an angui&s;h, that would have endured through the remainder of his life.</P>
<P>General Dnmourier from the time of his being at Tournay, ince&s;&s;antly meditated on this dreadful circum|&s;tance. Be&s;ide General Valence, the Duke de Chartres and General Thouvenot, who partook of his councils, he al&s;o confided his thoughts on this &s;ubject to Colonel Montjoy, and Colonel Nordmann, colonel of the regi|ment

of Berchiny. He propo&s;ed to &s;end tho&s;e two officers with three hundred hu&s;&s;ars to Paris, on the pre text of arre&s;ting de&s;erters, and &s;ending them back to the army. He meant to have given them di&s;patches to the mini&s;ter of war, which would have ju&s;tified their going to Paris, and would have given it a natural air, in the ca&s;e of their being interrogated. They were to proceed as covertly as po&s;&s;ible by the fore&s;t of Bondy; and afterward, reaching the pri&s;on by the Boulevard of the temple, were to force the guard, making fal&s;e attacks in &s;everal different points, carry off the four illu&s;trious pri&s;oners, placing each of them behind an hu&s;&s;ar, and having a voiture ready in the fore&s;t, to pu&s;h forward with the utmo&s;t &s;peed to Pont St. Maxence, where another body of cavalry were to be po&s;ted to meet them.</P>
<P>But to this end it was nece&s;&s;ary to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either Valenciennes, or Li&s;ie; and the circum&s;tances that followed defeated the project, to which tho&s;e two worthy officers whom we have ju&s;t named, were altoge|ther devoted. There remained no means of &s;aving the illu&s;trious pri&s;oners from the rage of the Jacobins. To form a con&s;piracy in Paris demanded time, and the emigrants had &s;o ill &s;ucceeded in attempts of that nature, that it had been madne&s;s in the general to have placed any confidence in &s;uch a plan. Deprived then of all hope of delivering the pri&s;oners, the general had no other re&s;ource in their behalf, than to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of ho&s;tages for their &s;afety. Hence he had &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to feize upon the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Conven|tion at Li&s;le, and Valenciennes; and he was now de|termined to detain &s;uch as might put them&s;elves into his power.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 5th of April, a captain of Cha&s;&s;eurs, whom Dumourier had po&s;ted at Pont-a|Marque, on the road between Li&s;le, and Douay, with fifteen tru&s;ty and re&s;olute men under his command, with orders to arre&s;t any couriers, but above all the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Convention, if they took the road from Li&s;le to Paris, brought him advice that Beurnonville the mini&s;ter of war had pa&s;&s;ed them on the road to Li&s;ie, and had informed him. (the captain of Cha&s;&s;eurs) that he &s;hould afterward proceed to the head quarters of his riend General Dumourier. The intimacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted etween this mini&s;ter and the General was known.
<PB N="231" REF="026918_0225_0FD26178B0ED2580">
Dumourier was a&s;toni&s;hed that he had received no couri|er from Beurnonville, nor any manner of advice re&s;pect|ing his journey, at a time when the General could no longer doubt of his being pro&s;cribed, and when the <HI>Rubicon</HI> was already pa&s;&s;ed. This was the fir&s;t and the only intimation which Dumourier received to prepare him for the important &s;cene that followed.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the evening, two couriers came to the General to announce the arrival of the mini&s;ter of war with four commi&s;&s;ioners of the National Convention. Terror and de&s;pair were painted on the countenance of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers. Interrogated by &s;ome of the &s;taff offi|cers re&s;pecting the cau&s;e, they did not he&s;itate to &s;ay that General Dumourier was utterly lo&s;t, that the commi&s;&s;i|oners came to conduct him to the bar of the Convention in virtue of a decree, but that the general would never reach Paris, &s;ince a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were planted on the road by bands of twenty and thirty, at Gournay, Roye, and Sen|lis, in order to murder him. They even indicated who the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were, being &s;oldiers belonging to two new regiments, called the Hu&s;&s;ars and dragoons of the Re|public. The general had broken a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quadron of the Hu&s;|&s;ars. for having refu&s;ed to obey their colonel, and had &s;ent them back to France on foot and without arms, which the Jacobins had re&s;tored them in order to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate their general. The regiment of dragoons con&s;i&s;ted of men who had committed numerous crimes at Paris, from which they had been &s;ent with great difficulty to join the army, where they attempted to repeat their crimes. Their conduct was cowardly and attrocious, and the general was compelled to act with &s;everity toward them on his retreat from the Netherlands. They after|ward de&s;erted and fled to Paris. when they were now di&s;|patched to be the accomplices of the Hu&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>Immediately afterward the mini&s;ter of war appeared, followed by the four commi&s;&s;ioner, who were Camus, La Marque, Bancal, and Quinette. The mini&s;ter after em|bracing the general with expre&s;&s;ions natural to their mu|tual attachment, Informed him that the commi&s;&s;ioners came to notify to the general a decree of the National Convention. General Valence was already with Du|mourier, and the re&s;t of the &s;taff officers now crouded into the apartment. Partaking of the opinions of their gene|ral as they had partaken of his fatigues, dangers, victories,
<PB N="232" REF="026918_0226_0FD261B976F06078">
and defeats, his fate was not to be &s;eparated from theirs; and indignation rather that inquietude was expre&s;&s;ed in their looks. Dumourier &s;aw that this temper of mind might break out into violent con&s;equences, which induced him the more to pre&s;erve the compo&s;ure with which he was determined to act in this critical moment.</P>
<P>Dumourier would be unju&s;t if he did not offer the ho|mage of his e&s;teem and gratitude, to tho&s;e generous men, who in the mid&s;t of his di&s;graces pre&s;erved the con&s;tancy of their friend&s;hip to him, and their attachment to princi|ple, by &s;acrificing emolument and honors, to follow him in his retreat. Nor can he forbear here to record the magnanimity of General Valence, who being offered the command of the Armies on condition of arre&s;ting Du|mourier, not only &s;purned at the offer without he&s;itation, but concealed the dangerous temptations laid before him by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention from the know|ledge of Dumourier.</P>
<P>Camus &s;poke for the members of this deputation. In a manner that expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome degree of irre&s;olution, he reque&s;ted the general to go into another room with the deputies, and mini&s;ter of war, in order to hear a decree of the Convention re&s;pecting him. The general an&s;wered, that as all his actions had ever been public, and as the &s;ubject of a decree pa&s;&s;ed by &s;even hundred per&s;ons could be no my&s;tery, he &s;aw no rea&s;on for complying with the reque&s;t, and that the officers who were pre&s;ent ought to be witne&s;&s;es of whatever &s;hould pa&s;s in this interview. Beur|nonville, however, as well as the deputies, urged the re|que&s;t with &s;uch appearance of re&s;pect that the General went with them into an inner room, but his &s;taff officers would not permit the door to be clo&s;ed, and General Va|lence entered the room with him.</P>
<P>Camus pre&s;ented the decree to Dumourier; who, hav|ing read it with perfect compo&s;ure, returned it, and ob|&s;erved, that forbearing within certain limits to condemn a deci&s;ion of the National Convention, he could not but judge this order to be untimely, &s;ince the army was di&s;organized and di&s;contented, and &s;ince his quitting it in that condition would be followed by its total di&s;&s;olution; that it would be prudent to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the decree, till he &s;hould have re&s;tored the army to its proper footing, when he would be ready to render an account of his conduct; and when it might be decided whether cir|cum&s;tances required or permitted his appearance at Paris;
<PB N="233" REF="026918_0227_0FD2617BF771C190">
that he read in that decree, an article empowering the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;u&s;pend him from his functions and ap|point another General, in the ca&s;e of his di&s;obeying the order; that the Convention having charged them with a commi&s;&s;ion including &s;uch &s;everity toward the general, and of &s;o delicate a nature with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, had certainly relied no le&s;s on their prudence than on their firmne&s;s, that therefore he would throw him&s;elf on their di&s;cretion, and would not po&s;itively refu&s;e obedience, but merely demand a delay in the execution of their order: that, in fine, being now judges of all the circum&s;tances, they could ea&s;ily re&s;olve on the conduct that became them, and if they were determined upon &s;u&s;pending him, he would meet them half way, by him&s;elf offering his re|&s;ignation to them, which he had &s;o often tendered during the la&s;t three months to the Convention.</P>
<P><HI>Camus replied that the deputies had no authority to re|ceive the General's re&s;ignation; and then &s;aid,</HI> But if your re&s;ignation were accepted of, what would be your conduct afterwards? I &s;hould act as became me, <HI>the General an|&s;wered</HI>; but I have no he&s;itation in declaring to you, I will neither by going to Paris &s;ubject my&s;elf to be treated unworthily by fanatics, nor to be condemned to death by a revolutionary tribunal.&mdash;Then you do not acknowledge that tribunal, <HI>&s;aid Camus.</HI>&mdash;I recogni&s;e in it, <HI>replied the Gene|ral,</HI> a tribunal of Blood and of Crimes, to which I never will &s;ubmit while I have a &s;word that will not deceive me. I moreover declare, that had I the power I would aboli&s;h it, as being a di&s;honour to a free Nation.</P>
<P>The other three deputies who were men of much more temper and moderation than Camus, perceiving that the conver&s;ation became intemperate, interpo&s;ed, and en|deavoured to convince the general that the Convention had no inimical de&s;igns again&s;t him; that he was loved and e&s;teemed by every one, and that his pre&s;ence in Paris would de&s;troy the calumnies of his enemies; that his ab|&s;ence from the troops would not be long, and that the de|puties and mini&s;ter of war would remain with the army till his return. Quinette offered to accompany the gene|ral to Paris to be the pledge of his &s;afety, and to return with him, making the mo&s;t fervent prote&s;tations that he would per&s;onally expo&s;e him&s;elf to all danger in the general's defence. After this the conver&s;ation became more cool and temperate, Bancal, a man of reading and
<PB N="234" REF="026918_0228_0FD261BB0EB08F20">
talent, endeavoured to win the general by his regard for his name, and cited examples of obedience and re&s;igna|tion to the laws of the Greeks and Romans. <HI>Let us have done with mi&s;takes, Sir,</HI> &s;aid the general; <HI>we degrade the Roman hi&s;tory; and disfigure the Roman virtues, that they may &s;erve as an excu&s;e for our crimes. The Romans did not ma&s;&s;acre Tarquin. The Roman republic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;table government and ju&s;t laws. They neither had a Jacobin club, nor a revolutionary tribunal. We are in a &s;tate of anarchy. Ferocious men thir&s;t for my blood, and I tell you that I have often acted the part of Decius but never will that of Curtius.</HI></P>
<P>The deputies a&s;&s;ured Dumourier that he had formed an unju&s;t idea of the &s;tate of Paris; and that indeed he was neither called before the Jacobins, nor the revolutionary tribunal, but to the Bar of the National Convention, and that he would &s;peedily return to his po&s;t.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the month of January at Paris, <HI>&s;aid the gene|ral,</HI> and &s;urely that city has not become more rea&s;onable &s;ince, e&s;pecially in the moment of public danger. I know by the mo&s;t authentic of your journals, that the Convention is governed by Marat, the Jacobins, and the tumultuous tribunes filled with the emi&s;&s;aries of the Jacobins. The Convention has not the power of &s;aving me from the fury of the&s;e men; and, if it became the re&s;pect that I ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my|&s;elf to appear before &s;uch judges, even my deportment would provoke my death.</P>
<P>Camus then returned to his categorical que&s;tion. <HI>You refu&s;e to obey the decree of the Convention</HI>? The general an&s;wered that he had already &s;tated to the deputies his view of the &s;ubject. He urged them to take a moderate cour&s;e, and exhorted them to return to Valenciennes, and from thence to make a report to the Convention, &s;etting forth the general's rea&s;ons, and &s;upporting tho&s;e by &s;hew|ing the impo&s;&s;ibility of taking the general from his army at this in&s;tant, without incurring the greate&s;t ri&s;k of di&s;|banding it.</P>
<P>Dumourier acknowledges that, had they yielded to the&s;e coun&s;els, he &s;hould have been imprudent enough to have permitted their departure. The colleagues of Camus ap|peared by no means unwilling to li&s;ten to rea&s;on, altho' on his part he rudely repul&s;ed every conciliatory mea&s;ure. <HI>Call to mind,</HI> &s;aid one of them, <HI>that your di&s;obedience in this ca&s;e will cau&s;e the ruin of the republic. Cambon &s;aid in your tribune amid&s;t bur&s;ts of applau&s;e,</HI> an&s;wered the gene|ral,
<PB N="235" REF="026918_0229_0FD2617F6CF619F0">
that the &s;ate of the republic re&s;ts not upon any one man. I have, be&s;ide, to ob&s;erve that the name of the republic does not belong to us; our condition is ab&s;olute, anarchy. I &s;wear to you that I have no de&s;ire to elude enquiry. I promi&s;e you on my honour, a pledge that is inviolable with military men, that when the nation &s;hall have a govern|ment, and laws, I will give a faithful account of my actions and motives. I will my&s;elf demand a trial. At pre&s;ent, it would be an act of in&s;anity in me.</P>
<P>The conference la&s;ted more than two hours, but that which has been &s;tated was the exact purport of it. The deputies retired into another chamber, to decide on the cour&s;e they &s;hould pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Dumourier was at this period deceived re&s;pecting the de&s;igns, and the conduct of Beurnonville; in con&s;equence of which he has made unju&s;t complaints of that mini&s;ter. He learned afterward from a virtuous and impartial man, that Beurnonville was con&s;tant in his friend&s;hip to Dumourier; and the gro&s;s accu&s;ations of Marat again&s;t that mini&s;ter is an additional proof of the fact: and Dumourier is eager to make this public avowal of his error.</P>
<P>It is certain that Beurnonville, being &s;everal times ap|pealed to by Dumourier re&s;pecting the conduct he would ob&s;erve in this ca&s;e, con&s;tantly &s;aid. <HI>I cannot advi&s;e you. You know what it becomes you to do.</HI> As &s;oon as the deputies were withdrawn, the general complained that Beurnonville had forborne to give him intelligence of the approach of this important event, at the &s;ame time how|ever reque&s;ting him to join the army, and again to take upon him the command of the advanced guard. Beur|nonville an&s;wered, <HI>I know that I &s;hall fall a &s;acrifice to my enemies, but I have re&s;olved to die at my po&s;t. My &s;i|tuation is terrifying. I &s;ee you are decided, and that the &s;tep you will take is of the mo&s;t de&s;perate kind. I demand as a favour at your hands that you will not &s;eparate my fate from that of the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ties.&mdash;Be a&s;&s;ured that I will not,</HI> an&s;wered the General. Dumourier was at that moment unju&s;t to the magnanimity of Beurnonville, whom he con|&s;idered to be per&s;idious, or at the be&s;t unworthily carried away by circum&s;tances. May he receive &s;ome con&s;ola|tion in this ju&s;tice rendered to him by Dumourier. And may his heart, ju&s;tly offended, be open to receive the at|tonement of his friend!</P>
<P>Beurnonville, Valence, and Dumourier returned to the officers, who impatiently waited the re&s;ult of this long
<PB N="236" REF="026918_0230_0FD261BD866AAB70">
Conference. But their inquietude was not entirely di&s;&s;i|pated, for the general did not then acquaint them with the re&s;olution he had taken. The&s;e officers have &s;ince told him that, had he con&s;ented to go to Paris, they would have prevented it by violence.</P>
<P>When the deputies fir&s;t arrived at the general's quarters, the regiment of Berchiny was drawn up in the court yard; and the general had commanded Colonel Nordmann to &s;elect an officer on whom he could rely, together with thirty men, and to hold them in readine&s;s to execute his orders. The pa&s;&s;ions by which the troops were agitated were forcibly expre&s;&s;ed in their looks, and the general exerted his influence to moderate them.</P>
<P>In this interval while the Deputies were deliberating, Dumourier in walking met doctor Menuret, &s;urgeon to the army, and &s;aid to him, <HI>Well doctor, what remedy &s;hall we apply to this wound</HI>? Menuret an&s;wered quickly, <HI>the &s;ame as in the preceding year at the camp of Maulde, a grain of di&s;obedience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In about an hour the deputies returned to the General's room, Camus much agitated, &s;aid har&s;hly,</HI> Citizen General, are you ready to obey the decree of the National Convention, and go with us to Paris? <HI>The General replied,</HI> Not in this in&s;tant.&mdash;Then, <HI>&s;aid Camus,</HI> I &s;u&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd you from your functions. You no longer command the armies. I forbid all per&s;ons to obey you, and command every one to a&s;&s;i&s;t in arre&s;ting you. I will go my&s;elf and place the &s;eals on your papers.</P>
<P>A murmur of indignation was heard. <HI>Give me the names of tho&s;e per&s;ons,</HI> Camus cried out rudely, pointing to the officers around him. <HI>They will them&s;elves give you their names.&mdash;I have now other employment,</HI> replied Ca|mus, who no longer knew what he &s;aid: <HI>I demand your papers.</HI></P>
<P>Dumourier now &s;aw that the emotion of his officers was at its height and on the point of producing &s;ome ra&s;h action. He &s;aid, in a firm tone, <HI>This is in&s;ufferable. It is time to put an end to &s;uch in&s;olence.</HI> And, in the Ger|man language he commanded the Hu&s;&s;ars to enter. He then ordered the officer of the hu&s;&s;ars to arre&s;t the four de|puties and the mini&s;ter of war, but not to do them any per|&s;onal injury, and to leave Beurnonville his arms.</P>
<P>Camus then &s;aid, <HI>General Dumourier, you are about to de&s;troy the Republic.&mdash;Say rather it is you, old madman,</HI> the General replied to him.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="026918_0231_0FD2618286ED8B58">
They were conducted into another chamber; and af|ter having dined, were conveyed in their own carriage to Tourmy, e&s;corted by a &s;quadron of the hu&s;&s;ars of Ber|chiny. Dumourier &s;ent a letter to General Clairfait, &s;aying that he &s;ent him ho&s;tages, who would be re&s;pon&s;i|ble for the exce&s;&s;es that might be committed at Paris. He reque&s;ted General Clairfait to treat the mini&s;ter of war, with more di&s;tinction than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Such were the facts relative to the arre&s;t of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention, which was a mea&s;ure forced on the General by circum&s;tances. As to the act of de|livering them into the hands of the Imperiali&s;ts, it is to be remembered that Dumourier had no fortre&s;s in which he could keep them in &s;afety, and that the Imperiali&s;ts being as deeply concerned as him&s;elf in the fate of the pri&s;oners of the Temple, they could not be placed in any hands &s;o &s;ure. They could be detained merely as ho&s;tages, nor was there any danger to their per&s;onal &s;afety, their de|tention being &s;imply an act of precaution on the part of Dumourier. Be&s;ides, it is to be recollected, that the Prince of Cobourg con&s;ented to act on the footing of an auxiliary to General Dumourier, in this war, for the overthrow of the Jacobins, and for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Con&s;titution. Hence the&s;e ho&s;tages were not really pri&s;oners of the Imperiali&s;ts, but tho&s;e of General Du|mourier, for whom they held them. The deputies and the mini&s;ter of war were &s;ent to Mae&s;tricht, where they were kept till a change of circum&s;tances required their removal.</P>
<P>This event is one more in&s;tance of the blind precipita|tion attending upon all the mea&s;ures of the National Con|vention. It is to be remarked al&s;o, that Camus, who went po&s;t from Liege to vote for the death of Louis XVI. had in this, la&s;t in&s;tance, &s;uddenly quitted the frontier, to pro|cure the arre&s;t of General Dumourier, had him&s;elf dicta|ted the decree, and had demanded to be charged with its execution. It was therefore that he was &s;o unreleuting during the conference, le&s;t his colleagues &s;hould have yielded to per&s;ua&s;ion, and &s;hould have returned to Va|lenciennes, as they were coun&s;elled to do by the Ge|neral.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate General Dumourier on the 4th of April. Events of the 5th of April. Departure of General Dumourier.</HEAD>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after this important event, Dumou|rier &s;ent Colonel Montjoye to acquaint Colonel Mack with the circum&s;tance; and to appoint a time and place, for a conference between the General and Colonel Mack, for the purpo&s;e of finally concluding upon the terms of their treaty, and for &s;ettling the mea&s;ures that &s;hould be reciprocally taken, according to the conduct that &s;hould be adopted by Dumourier's army after this deci&s;ive period. Being informed that a congre&s;s of the Mini&s;ters of the Combined Powers would &s;peedily be held at Antwerp, Dumourier &s;ent General Valence to Bru&s;&s;els that he might be nearer the neighbourhood of the Congre&s;s. During the night, Dumourier compo&s;ed a &s;hort manife&s;to, which was dige&s;ted and put into form the following day. In this, he drew up a recital of the facts of that day, and expo&s;ed his motives for arre&s;ting the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Convention. He particularly in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing ho&s;tages, a regard for who&s;e &s;afety might pre|vent the crimes in which the Jacobins might otherwi&s;e in|dulge on learning the event.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 3d of April, the General went to the camp, and addre&s;&s;ed the troops on the part he had acted, who appeared to approve of it with enthu&s;ia&s;m. He afterward went to St. Amand, in which place were the corps of artillery, who te&s;tified the &s;ame approbation of the Ge|neral's conduct, as the troops in the camp, although the mo&s;t indefatigable zeal to &s;educe this corps was employed by the emi&s;&s;aries of the Jacobins of Valenciennes, and e&s;pecially by two of Dumourier's &s;uperior officers, one of whom, a Lieutenant-colonel named Boubers, had received very particular obligations from the General.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="026918_0233_0FD261842CFA5BC8">
Dumourier deemed it prudent to &s;leep at St. Amand, for the purpo&s;e of marking his confidence in the troops there; and at this place Colonel Montjoye brought him the an&s;wer of Colonel Mack. It was agreed that the following morning the Prince of Cobourg, the Arch|duke Charles, and the Baron de Mack &s;hould meet General Dumourier, between Bo&s;&s;u and Conde, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;olving on the movements of the two armies, and re&s;pecting the direction of the &s;uccours that &s;hould be granted of Imperial troops in the ca&s;e of Du|mourier having occa&s;ion to demand them.</P>
<P>The whole day of the 3d of April pa&s;&s;ed with as great &s;ucce&s;s as the General could expect. The army appeared of one mind, with the exception of &s;ome mur|murs that were heard among &s;ome of the battalions of volunteers: and a movement which the General prepared to make on the 5th, was calculated to bani&s;h the &s;ecret means of intrigue. The General de&s;igned to take a new po&s;ition with the greater part of his army near Orchies, by which means he would remove the troops from the dangerous neighbourhood of Valenciennes; would de|&s;troy the lei&s;ure that belongs to a permanent camp, and in which intrigues have the greate&s;t &s;cope for action; and would be able to menace Li&s;le, Douay, and Bouchain. He acknowledges that, had he adopted this plan imme|diately on his entering the territory of France, he would probably have been more &s;ucce&s;sful. But, at that peri|od he relied on Valenciennes and Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and, perhaps, it is to this error that the &s;equel is to be attributed.</P>
<P>It is, however, difficult to determine at pre&s;ent what would have happened in that ca&s;e. The character of the events of that period, is &s;uch as no prudence could fore|&s;ee; &s;ines they were the &s;udden acts of the caprice of the people, which were &s;ubject to no calculation, and that followed each other with a rapidity to which neither fore&s;ight nor talent could oppo&s;e any ob&s;tacle. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the principle which &s;o abruptly detached the French &s;oldiers from a General whom they had previou&s;ly adored, has an a&s;pect that cannot be regarded without aprobation. They were in arms for the liberty of their country. They &s;aw their General treat with the enemy. They thought them&s;elves betrayed, and they pa&s;&s;ed from an e&s;teem for their General to the hatred of him. They were not
<PB N="240" REF="026918_0234_0FD261C228BB7D80">
informed of the purport of his negotiations, nor of the care the General had taken in that treaty, of the intere&s;ts, and honor of his country. He had not been able to do more, with re&s;pect to his troops, than to &s;tate to them in general terms the nece&s;&s;ity of changing the government, and putting an end to anarchy. They applauded the de&s;ign; but, as the General had not aided his plan by &s;eductions, nor by terrors, the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion wore ca|&s;ily away; and the activity of the Jacobins, more con|&s;tant, more vigilant, and of a nature much more adapted to make impre&s;&s;ions upon them, was employed with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The gro&s;&s;e&s;t calumny takes root &s;peedily in the minds of men; but more than in any other time, in a period agitated by the doemon of anarchy. Su&s;picion ripens in times of revolution, The word <HI>Traitor</HI> being once pro|nounced, the multitude endeavoured to find, in the defini|tion of this word, the exact portrait of the General, whom proclamations, but &s;till more the ba&s;er intrigues of cor|ruption, devoted to di&s;grace. His prudence was now ar|tifice; his love of the public welfare, per&s;onal ambition; and a &s;ilence dictated by his judgment, knavery. One quarter of an hour employed in the concealed labour of fal&s;ehood, &s;upported by the powerful engine of corruption, effaced all &s;ober reflection in men, who&s;e condition pre|cludes them from much thought, and who delight in bar|barous and bloody &s;cenes.</P>
<P>If we cooly examine the progre&s;s of the revolution, we &s;hall &s;ee that the activity of the <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llotire</HI> is the motive of the high patrioti&s;m of the French. The &s;pectacle of &s;e|vered heads, of torn limbs, carried in proce&s;&s;ion throughout Paris and other cities, has begotten a terror in &s;ome, and in the re&s;t an audacious barbarity; and in both ca&s;es has produced a deci&s;ive effect, leading the former by fear, and the latter by the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for their im|punity, to the endle&s;s multiplication of murders. The con&s;equence is that the blood &s;pilt by this dreadful engine has converted the nation into a ma&s;s capable of effecting a&s;toni&s;hing objects.</P>
<P>Frenchmen, do not be led to &s;uppo&s;e that the indul|gence with which Dumourier judges you, is an eulogium on your conduct! He dete&s;ts your crimes. He regards the &s;pecies of liberty you enjoy, as wild and incompatible with the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety; and he would rather peri&s;h on your unju&s;t and permanent &s;caffold, than be the apolo|gi&s;t or partaker of your phr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nzy!</P>

This digre&s;&s;ion faithfully paints the feelings of Du|mourier's mind, at the dreadful period which perhaps de|cided the fate of France. Agitated by the various pa&s;|&s;ions &s;pringing from his &s;ituation, but &s;till directed by prin|ciples, he re&s;i&s;ted the temptations of ambition. His ju&s;tice would not permit him to be Cromwell, nor Monk, nor Coriolanus. His power was extreme, but his wi&s;hes mo|derate. And it is now a con&s;olation to him that he is unfortunate rather than criminal.</P>
<P>Dumourier received various reports every in&s;tant, re|&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;ition of the garri&s;on of Conde. Pre|vious to his moving with his army to Orchies, he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf perfectly of Conde; in order to arrange the movements of the Imperiali&s;ts, his treaty with whom he dated not avow, till he &s;hould have made a declaration to his troops of his ultimate views, and &s;hould have commenced his march to Paris.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 4th, he departed from St. Amand for Conde. He had left General Thouvenot at St. Amand, to regulate various details relative to his projected movement, and to watch the public temper. An e&s;cort of fifty hu&s;&s;ars, which he ordered to attend him, not arriv|ing as he expected, and the time for his conference with the Prince of Coburg approaching, he left one of his aids-|de-camp to follow him with the e&s;cort, and departed with the Duke de Chartres, Colonel Thouvenot, Colonel Mont|joye, &s;ome aids-de-camp, and eight hu&s;&s;ars; forming to|gether a company of about thirty per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Dumourier proceeded towards Conde without any ap|prehen&s;ion, his thoughts being deeply engaged on &s;ubjects far different from the fatal event which was about to arrive, and of which he had not the lea&s;t pre&s;entiment. Being within half a league of Conde, between Fre&s;nes and Doumet, he met an officer di&s;patched by General Neuilly, to inform him that the garri&s;on were in the greate&s;t fermentation, and that it would not be pru|dent for him to enter the place, till the commotion &s;hould have ended, whether it &s;hould be in his favour or again&s;t him. Dumourier &s;ent back the officer with an order to General Neuilly, to &s;end the 18th regiment of cavalry to Doumet to e&s;cort him.</P>
<P>He had a little before overtaken a column of three bat|talions of volunteers marching towards Conde, with their baggage and artillery. Surpri&s;ed at this march, for which he had given no orders, he demanded of the officers where
<PB N="242" REF="026918_0236_0FD261C7ACC862D0">
they were going. They an&s;wered to Valenciennes, and he ob&s;erved to them that they had turned their back on Valenciennes, and were proceeding to Conde. At this time he was in the mid&s;t of them, and had &s;topped by the &s;ide of a ditch to &s;uffer them to pa&s;s. He does not conceive why they did not then arre&s;t him.</P>
<P>While they were yet in fight it was that General Neu|illy's me&s;&s;enger arrived. Then comparing in his mind the tum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt of the garri&s;on of Conde, and the unexpected march of the&s;e three battalions, he withdrew an hundred paces from the high road, with a de&s;ign of entering the fir&s;t hou&s;e in Doumet, for the purpo&s;e of writing a formal order to the&s;e three battalions, to return to the camp of Bruille, to which they belonged.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, the head of the column &s;uddenly quit|ted the high road, and ran toward him, uttering dreadful cries. He then remounted his hor&s;e, and proceeded at a moderate pace toward a broad ditch, on the other &s;ide of which was a mar&s;hy ground. Shouts, in&s;ults, reproaches, and above all the words, <HI>&s;top &s;top,</HI> forced him to pa&s;s the ditch. His hor&s;e having refu&s;ed to take it, he was obli|ged to clear it on foot. He was no &s;ooner on the other &s;ide, than a di&s;charge of mu&s;kets &s;ucceeded the former tu|multuous cries. The whole column was in&s;tantly in mo|tion; the head and centre endeavouring to overtake him, and the rear quitting the high road with equal rapidity, to get between him and the camp of Bruille, which he was endeavouring to regain.</P>
<P>He was now in the mo&s;t imminent danger. He was on foot. The Baron de Scomberg threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted on the general's mounting, though with the certain &s;acrifice of his own life. The general refu&s;ed. At length he mounted a hor&s;e belonging to a dome&s;tic of the Duke de Chartres, who, being extremely active, fled on foot. Dumourier's hor&s;e was taken and led in tri|umph to Valenciennes. Two hu&s;&s;ars were killed, as well as two of the general's dome&s;tics, one of whom carried his great coat. Colonel Thouvenot had two hor&s;es kil|led under him, and &s;aved him&s;elf at la&s;t by mounting be|hind the faithful Bapti&s;te, who al&s;o lo&s;t two hor&s;es. The unfortunate Cantin, the general's &s;ecretary, was taken and peri&s;hed on a &s;caffold. This young man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great under&s;tanding, courage, fidelity, and patrioti&s;m. The three battalions fired more than ten thou&s;and ball.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="026918_0237_0FD261874B574260">
The general, unable to regain his camp, proceeded a|long the Scheldt, and arrived, &s;till pur&s;ued, though not &s;o clo&s;ely, at a ferry, a little di&s;tance from the village of Wihers, which was &s;ituated on the Imperial territory. He pa&s;&s;ed the river, accompanied by five other per&s;ons. The remainder gained the camp of Maulde, through a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry. As &s;oon as the general had pa&s;&s;ed the river he proceeded on foot through a mora&s;s, to a neighbouring hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where, at fir&s;t he was refu&s;ed admittance, but on announcing his name was immediately received by the worthy owner. Thence he continued his route on foot to Bury, where was quartered a divi&s;ion of the Imperial regiment of dragoons of la Tour. Here he wrote to Co|lonel Mack, and took &s;ome refre&s;hment, of which he &s;tood greatly in need. He was already joined by the faithful Bapti&s;te, who, pa&s;&s;ing through the whole of the camp, had turned by Montagne, and had every where &s;pread an alarm.</P>
<P>Dumourier learnt from Bapti&s;te, and other per&s;ons du|ring the cour&s;e of the day, that the de&s;igns of the three battalions were entirely unknown to the troops; that, on the news of their de&s;ertion and attempt to murder the ge|neral being &s;pread, the &s;tronge&s;t indignation was expre&s;|ed by the &s;oldiery; and that the e&s;cort of hu&s;&s;ars and &s;ome other hor&s;e had pur&s;ued the three battalions, who &s;udden|ly wheeling, had fled to Valenciennes, Bapti&s;te added, that the whole camp was in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t inquie|tude, and importunately demanded the return of the gene|ral.</P>
<P>It was now too late to rejoin his army, and it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould wait for Colonel Mack, to whom he owed an account of the rea&s;on of his failing in the appoint|ment in the morning. That officer arrived in the eve|ning; and Dumourier having recited to him the attempt which had been made on his per&s;on, ob&s;erved, that this was the crime of individuals, which far from corrupting the di&s;po&s;ition of his troops, would nece&s;&s;arily &s;trengthen their attachment to their General. and de&s;troy all their remaining connection with the anarchi&s;ts; that con&s;equent|ly, far from being di&s;couraged, his de&s;ign was to return to his camp by day-break the following morning, to put him|&s;elf at the head of his &s;oldiers who loudly demanded his return, and to pur&s;ue his plan openly and with the utmo&s;t vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="026918_0238_0FD261C54E9AEC10">
Colonel Mack, to whom the military virtues were fa|miliar, has &s;ince acknowledged that this &s;pecies of cou|rage then appeared to him more a&s;toni&s;hing than that which is di&s;played in the dangers of a battle. Had he then &s;een all the &s;oul of Dumourier, he would have found this ap|parent &s;ecurity mingled with apprehen&s;ion, excited by the example and fate of La Fayette. But the general's re&s;o|lution was taken. He re&s;olved to &s;acrifice him&s;elf through|out; and would not give his army occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that the de&s;ertion was on his part, or that, being recalled by his &s;oldiers, he had re&s;i&s;ted their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Dumourier pa&s;&s;ed part of the night in dige&s;ting, with Colo|nel Mack, the proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg, which appeared on the 5th of April, with that of General Du|mourier. The Imperial General in his proclamation de|clared, that he was now no more than an auxiliary in the war, again&s;t the anarchi&s;ts of France; that it was not the intention of his &s;overeign to make conque&s;ts, but to co-ope|rate, in re&s;toring peace and order to France, with Gene|ral Dumourier, who&s;e principles, as they were expre&s;&s;ed in his proclamation, he adopted.</P>
<P>It was again agreed by Colonel Mack, and Dumourier, that, as &s;oon as the latter &s;hould be ma&s;ter of Conde, he &s;hould deliver it to the Au&s;trians, in order to &s;erve as a magazine and place of arms for the Imperial army, in the ca&s;e of aid being demanded by Dumourier; that he &s;hould be in&s;tantly furni&s;hed with &s;uch &s;uccours as he &s;hould de|mand; that he &s;hould &s;pecify the number of infantry and cavalry to be granted him, the mode in which the&s;e &s;hould &s;erve, whether by a junction with his troops, or by mak|ing one or more &s;eparate diver&s;ions in behalf of the cau&s;e; that, however, Dumourier &s;hould not call for &s;uccours, but in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute need, it being more agreeable to the mutual object of the parties, that he &s;hould endeavour to ac|compli&s;h it by his own troops only; and that, in ca&s;e of his being able to do &s;o, the Imperiali&s;ts &s;hould remain neuter, and &s;hould not pa&s;s the frontiers of France.</P>
<P>The proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg, made in con&s;equence of this negociation, has been condemned but unju&s;tly. Of what real advantage had it not been to the Imperiali&s;ts, and what &s;olid glory had they not acquired, if, by enabling Dumourier to march to Paris, they could by this noble moderation have &s;pared the blood and trea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> that will be wa&s;ted in this quarrel, for which the towns
<PB N="245" REF="026918_0239_0FD26188B1B84580">
that may be acquired with infinite difficulty will be no manner of compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>It is to be feared that an avidity for conque&s;ts among the belligerent powers is the real ob&s;tacle to the termina|tion of this de&s;tructive war. By this pa&s;&s;ion they were prevented from &s;eizing upon the occa&s;ion offered, by the departure of General Dumourier, and the con&s;equent annihilation of his army, of pre&s;&s;ing forward to Paris. The combined powers have &s;ince lo&s;t their time in ma|king a methodical war, while the French have been able to recover them&s;elves, and their armies have become more numerous, and better di&s;ciplined.</P>
<P>On the 5th of April at day-break, Dumourier pro|ceeded with an e&s;cort of fifty Imperial dragoons to the advanced guard of his camp at Maulde, where he was received with the greate&s;t joy. He harangued the &s;eve|ral corps, by whom he was an&s;wered with expre&s;&s;ions of affection. Notwith&s;tanding, he remarked that there were &s;ome indications of a contrary &s;pirit, and &s;everal factious groups a&s;&s;embled in different parts.</P>
<P>His next de&s;ign was to go to St. Amand, to prepare for the movement of his troops to Orchies, according to his former plan. As he was entering the city, one of his aids-de-camp came toward him on the full gallop, and informed him that during the night the corps of artillery, excited by the emi&s;&s;aries of Valenciennes, who had &s;pread the report that the general was drowned in the Scheldt in flying to the enemy, had &s;ent a deputation to Valen|ciennes, and that on the return of their deputies they had in&s;tantly ro&s;e upon their generals, driven them from the place, and were preparing to march to Valenci|ennes.</P>
<P>Dumourier had with him, two &s;quadrons of the regi|ment of Berchiny, a &s;quadron of the hu&s;&s;ars of Saxe, fifty curia&s;&s;iers, and a &s;quadron of the dragoons of Bour|bon. Yielding to his emotions of pa&s;&s;ion, he re&s;olved to fall upon St. Amand with this body of cavalry. His officers, however, repre&s;ented the danger and inutility of this &s;tep, as he had no infantry at hand, and would &s;ub|ject his e&s;cort to be mown down by the artillery. He gave way to their rea&s;oning. He learnt &s;hortly after that the corps of artillery went to Valenciennes. The money belonging to the army and the equipages of the officers remaining in the city without guard, he commanded them to be conducted to Rumegies, at the di&s;tance of a
<PB N="246" REF="026918_0240_0FD261C65A146058">
league from his camp, on the road to Orchies, that village being protected by a part of his advanced guard cantoned there.</P>
<P>The corps of artillery was the &s;lower and &s;trength of the French army. Feeling its importance, it abounded more than the others in clubs and orators, and indeed, might pa&s;s for the Pretorian guard of the revolution. When its de&s;ertion was known in the two camps, part of the troops followed, and confu&s;ion and di&s;may were &s;pread among, the re&s;t. Several of the general officers who waited for the opportunity were eager to lead entire divi&s;ions to Valenciennes. Tho&s;e who &s;till remained attached to the per&s;on, or principles of Dumourier, in&s;tead of &s;hewing them&s;elves to their troops, and &s;etting an example of courage, were &s;truck with terror, conceal|ed them&s;elves, or thought only of their own &s;afety. General La Marlier had been among the mo&s;t forward of the enemies of Anarchy, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the entire confidence of General Valenec; who, when he depar|ted from Bru&s;&s;els, confided the whole of his baggage and effects to him, with a reque&s;t that he would &s;end them alter Valence to Tournay. La Marlier appropri|ated the money, hor&s;es, and property of his general to his own u&s;e, and de&s;erted to Valenciennes.</P>
<P>Dumourier was at Rumegies, dictating, orders to be i&s;&s;ued to the different parts of the army, when he heard of the defection of the troops in camp. Nothing was left him now but to provide for his per&s;onal &s;afety. He mounted his hor&s;e, attended by General Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">not, and his brother the colonel, the Duke de Chartresy Colonel Montjoye, and Lieutenant-colonel Barrois, two or three others of his &s;taff, and &s;ome Aids-de-camp, having no e&s;cort; and retiring to Tournay alighted at the quarters of General Clairfait. He was followed in about an hour afterward, by fifty Cuira&s;&s;iers, half a &s;quadron of the hu&s;&s;ars of Saxe, and the whole of the regiment of Berchiny. Tho&s;e brave and worthy men, brought with them the equipages belonging to the general and the &s;taff officers, excepting the &s;addle hor&s;es of the general, which were &s;tolen by one of his grooms, who joined the anarchi&s;ts.</P>
<P>The troops of which we have ju&s;t &s;poken and a few others that arrived &s;hortly afterward, amounting to about &s;even hundred hor&s;e, and eight hundred infantry, fol|lowed the General without any &s;olicitation on his part;
<PB N="247" REF="026918_0241_0FD2618B149B0640">
and this circum&s;tance renders him the more anxious re|&s;pecting the &s;ate of tho&s;e men, the companions of his former glory, and of his la&s;t di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Dumourier in retiring from France invited no one to follow him. His plan had totally failed, and a few men more or le&s;s on either &s;ide would not influence events. The individuals attached to his cau&s;e had ties of family and of intere&s;t in France, and he re|&s;olved not to multiply misfortunes without benefit. Tho&s;e who followed him, therefore, had the real merit of being guided by principle.</P>
<P>In the confu&s;ion that &s;ucceeded the General's depar|ture, none of the orders that had been i&s;&s;ued were exe|cuted. Lieutenant-general Vouille, who commanded the advanced guard, did not receive the order of with|drawing it within the camp of Maulde till the 6th, when it was no longer in his power. The General retired to Tournay, as did al&s;o Major-general Neuilly, who had abandoned Conde, Major-general de Bannes, Second, and de Dumas, and &s;ome of the principal officers of the battalions of Volunteers; where they were afterward joined by Lieuitenant-general Mara&s;&s;e, Major Generals Rault and Berneron, and Colonel Arnaudin.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ury of the Army contained two millions of livres in &s;pecie. It had been carried from St. Amand to Furnes, between Conde and Valenciennes, by a battalion of Cha&s;&s;eurs, who at fir&s;t deliberated re&s;pecting the dividing of it among them&s;elves, but afterward being likely to quarrel, in order to avoid the blood&s;hed that would en&s;ue, made a merit of their patrioti&s;m and con|ducted it to Valenciennes. Soliva, a commi&s;&s;ary of the army of the Ardennes, pur&s;ued the&s;e troops with a &s;quadron of the dragoons of Bourbon, retook the money of the Glacis of Valencienoes, and led it back to Fur|nas: but being pre&s;&s;ed by new battalions was again obliged to adandon it. Soliva and the dragoons retired by Mons. They might have brought off the money had they pa&s;&s;ed by Bruille, and Mortagne, but the confu&s;ion of the moment prevented recollection and fore&s;ight. If the trea&s;ury of the army had been &s;aved, the General's &s;ituation had been very different; and the little army that followed his fortunes, would have encrea&s;ed rapidly, being in a &s;tate to pay them, in&s;tead of being as he really was, without money, This circum&s;tance proves, that the pay of the army was not embezzled by him, nor em|ployed
<PB N="248" REF="026918_0242_0FD261C969D8B908">
as a means of corruption. Dumourier placed little confidence in means of corruption, in which as the lea|der of a party his conduct was greatly erroneous.</P>
<P>Dumourier had not the qualities that were requi&s;ite for the leader of a party. It is probable that he would have filled the &s;tation of a General or an Amba&s;&s;ador with &s;uc|ce&s;s, under a &s;table government, whether monarchical, or republican. But the violent &s;tate of things in France, de&s;tructive of all his pre-conceived ideas of ju&s;tice, and in|ju&s;tice, threw him entirely out of his &s;phere. His acti|vity, &s;o greatly &s;poken of even by his enemies, was re|pre&s;&s;ed by his dread of committing crimes; and he pre|ferred his own e&s;teem to &s;ucce&s;s. Thus in his fir&s;t re|flections, after his retreat among the Imperiali&s;ts, he &s;aw the cau&s;e of his failure in him&s;elf, but he felicitated him|&s;elf on the fact. To have &s;wayed the fortune of France, had undoubtedly given him a noble place in hi&s;tory; but to have been indebted for it to the flagitiou&s;ne&s;s of his con|duct, was too &s;evere a condition; and he was happy in re&s;igning one to e&s;cape the other.</P>
<P>He invites men of high &s;tations to examine them&s;elves with the &s;ame au&s;terity; and morali&s;ts, to &s;tudy the influ|ence which character has on events. Cae&s;ar and Pom|pey, determined a noble quarrel by noble means, and on both &s;ides were di&s;played greatne&s;s of mind, virtues, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents. Had tho&s;e men been &s;urrounded with the low|e&s;t vices of the meane&s;t cla&s;&s;es in &s;ociety, they would have fled, or would have fallen victims. It demands a Maa|niello to conduct the populace, But when a great nation becomes an entire populace, neighbouring nations are thrown into the greate&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment; becau&s;e the elec|tric &s;pirit &s;preads with more rapidity among the people, than among the higher orders of men.</P>

Mons, accompanied by the Duke de Chartres, Colonel Thouvenot, Colonel Montjoye, and Lieutenant Colonel Barrois, pa&s;&s;ing by Bury, to concert mea&s;ures with the of|ficer commanding the Imperial advanced po&s;t, for protect|ing the retreat of &s;uch of the French as &s;hould join the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Imperiali&s;ts were faithful to their truce. It is cer|tain that had they fallen on the French camp on the 5th of April, they might have utterly de&s;troyed the army. Their conduct was therefore highly honourable: yet, without incurring the blame of per&s;idy, perhaps on that day they ought to have made a movement with their army, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the camp of Maulde, and &s;hewing them&s;elves at St. Amand: they not only would have found no re&s;i&s;tance, but probably would have been joined by &s;everal battalions of the French, which during more than four-and-twenty hours, appeared by their movements to be irre&s;olute as to the conduct they &s;hould pur&s;ue. But however this may be, the &s;idelity of the Imperiali&s;ts to their engagements, is to be applauded. Their motives were mo&s;t worthy, as well as the genero&s;ity with which they re|ceived the French refugees, who had certainly been a|mong the brave&s;t of their enemies.</P>

It was agreed between them, that the Impe|riali&s;ts &s;hould in&s;tantly be&s;iege Conde, and that the place &s;hould be &s;ummoned in the name of General Dumourier, who accordingly wrote the &s;ummons and &s;ent it the fol|lowing day to the Imperial head quarters. It was further agreed that a return &s;hould be made of the officers and &s;ol|diers which accompanied or followed Dumourier; that con&s;idering their having unfortunately lo&s;t their military che&s;t, they &s;hould receive the pay of their re&s;pective ranks, at the rate that officers of the &s;ame rank in the Imperial &s;ervice were paid, and &s;hould be placed on the &s;ame foot|ing; that a commi&s;&s;ary of war belonging to the Imperial army &s;hould be attached to the&s;e troops, together with a French commi&s;&s;ary, to certify the ju&s;tice of the returns; that an advance &s;hould be made from the Imperial trea|&s;ury of 30,000 florins, which &s;hould be put into the hands of the French &s;taff officers for the pay of their troops, that Dumourier &s;hould have the rank, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Feld-zeugmei&s;ter</HI> (general of the artillery); and that fi|nally, this pay and advance &s;hould be regarded as a loan to the party of Dumourier, and that the general &s;hould en|gage, as &s;oon as any progre&s;s &s;hould be made in France.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="026918_0244_0FD261CB736D5FF0">
It is a con&s;olation to General Dumourier, that the com|panions of his mifortunes continue to enjoy this e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. Indeed they have, &s;ince that period, been &s;ubject|ed to the condition of taking an oath, which was not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance required; but at that period they were the &s;oldiers of a party which no longer exi&s;ts, and it has been &s;ince deemed nece&s;&s;ary to demand that &s;ecurity for their fidelity. Dumourier would him&s;elf become their pledge with readine&s;e, having throughout the war tried their fidelity, courage, and re&s;ignation. Let them accept of this te&s;timony of the e&s;teem and affection of their ge|neral, and may they be recompen&s;ed for their virtues in contributing to the &s;ucce&s;s of the power whom they will faithfully &s;erve.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e arrangments, Dumourier cau&s;ed, by the order of the Prince of Cobourg, 10,000 florins to be advanced to the French troops at Leuze; unwilling, through motives of delicacy, to take the whole of the mo|ney agreed to be advanced, becau&s;e in penetrating &s;peed|ily into France this &s;um would have &s;erved till they could have proceeded further into the interior part of the coun|try; and Dumourier appeals to the Prince of Cobourg, Colonel Mack, and the other principal officers of the Imperial army, re&s;pecting the clearne&s;s and di&s;itere&s;tedne&s;s of his conduct. It was further decided that the general, till he &s;hould be employed with his troops, &s;hould be pro|vided with quarters, near tho&s;e of the Prince of Cobourg; and the Imperial head quarters being e&s;tabli&s;hed at Bou&s;&s;u, General Dumourier's quarters were fixed at the abbey of St. Ghi&s;lain.</P>
<P>Dumourier makes here an avowal of his gratitude to the general officers of the Imperial army, by whom he was treated with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of regard, and more par|ticularly by the Archduke Charles, and the Prince of Co|bourg. At this time was formed a friend&s;hip between Colonel Mack and Dumourier, which on the part of the latter will never be dimini&s;hed. Colonel Mack is an of|ficer of uncommon virtue, and military talents, and the un|bounded confidence placed in him by the Imperial army is the ju&s;t recompence of his &s;ervices. It is greatly to be hoped, for the intere&s;t of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, that the health of this officer will be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>During two days that Dumourier was at Mons, he was treated by the inabitants in a manner that is flattering to his own honour; and his reception was the &s;ame at Tour|nay, Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd indeed, throughout the whole of that cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rthy people being &s;en&s;ible of the &s;er|vices

he had rendered them, e&s;pecially on his return from Holland and during the retreat of his army to France.</P>
<P>It would be inju&s;tice not to name an in&s;tance of the de|licate attention of the Prince of Cobourg to Dumourier's &s;ituation. The General &s;eeing a corps of two hundred cha&s;&s;eurs belonging to the emigrants, as they pa&s;&s;ed thro' Mons, on their route to join the advanced guard of the army, repre&s;ented to the Prince of Cobourg, that this mingling of the emigrants with his troops could not but produce fatal effects, e&s;pecially on entering France; and the Prince of Cobourg in&s;tantly gave counter orders to the cha&s;&s;eurs; &s;ending them by Namur, to &s;erve in the ad|vanced guard of the Prince of Hohenloe.</P>
<P>The Prince of Lambe&s;c-Lorraine te&s;tified al&s;o to the general his gratitude for the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice rendered to his hou&s;e by Dumourier when he was Mini&s;ter of Fo|reign Affairs, in preventing an unju&s;t confi&s;cation of his property, and of that of the Prince&s;s of Vaudemont.</P>
<P>On the 7th of April, the Prince of Cobourg departed, with Colonel Mack, to attend the Congre&s;s, held at Ant|werp; from which place he returned on the evening of the 8th. Dumourier pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e two days at Leuze, in the mid&s;t of his comrades, who&s;e unea&s;ine&s;s he di&s;&s;ipated by informing them of the e&s;tabli&s;hments made for them by the Imperiali&s;ts. General Vouille took the command of the&s;e troops; and Dumourier, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by General Thouvenot, began to reform them, according to the re|gulations of the Imperial army; which was the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as the refugees were compo&s;ed only of fragments of the different corps; with the exception of the regiment of Berchiny. Dumourier quitted the companions of his misfortunes on the evening of the 8th, and felt &s;ome pre|&s;entiment that he &s;hould not return to them. On the morning of the 9th he arrived at Mons, where he found the Prince of Cobourg, &s;etting off for his head quarters. Dumourier went there al&s;o; and after treating further on what regarded their mutual intere&s;ts, he went in the eve|ning to the quarters which had been prepared for him at the abbey of St. Ghi&s;lain.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 10th of April, a proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg was brought to Dumourier, dated the 9th, which entirely annulled the former proclamation of the 5th; and expre&s;sly declared, that the Prince of Cobourg would thenceforth carry on the war again&s;t France, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> behalf of his &s;overeign. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would hold &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line"></P>

The emigrants have had the imprudence to rejoice at the i&s;&s;uing of this latter, and to condemn the former. It might be demanded if the&s;e emigrants were Frenchmen. But, &s;etting a&s;ide the influence of pa&s;&s;ions, by which not only individuals, but al&s;o the governments intere&s;ted in this war are Influenced, it will appear but too true, that the &s;econd proclamation of the Prince of Cobourg in de|priving Dumourier's party of all means of acting in con|cert, and in &s;etting forth the belligerent powers as rapa|cious conquerors, has attached the whole of the French armies to the intere&s;t of the National Convention, which the greater part of them had previou&s;ly dete&s;ted; has compelled the cau&s;e of royalty to be forgot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en, in the dan|ger of the country; has pointed out the &s;alvation of France as re&s;ting on the exi&s;tence of the Republic; has rallied the different parties round the &s;tandard of the national honour; and has certainly been injurious to the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign, and rendered the i&s;&s;ue of the war ex|tremely uncertain.</P>
<P>This &s;econd proclamation was i&s;&s;ued at the conclu&s;ion of the Congre&s;s at Antwerp, in con&s;equence of the deter|mination of the mini&s;ters of the combined powers. Du|mourier now &s;aw that his treaty with the Imperiali&s;ts was entirely de&s;troyed; and, without offering u&s;ele&s;s com|plaints of this &s;udden change in the councils of the Impe|riali&s;ts, he con&s;ulted only his character, and principles, and re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all his per&s;onal intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>He repaired in&s;tantly to the head quarters, and told the Prince of Cobourg frankly, that he came to thank him for the per&s;onal kindne&s;&s;es he had rendered him, and that he hoped to continue to merit his e&s;teem; that when he en|tered into a treaty with the Prince of Cobourg, his object was the regeneraton of France, and not its di&s;member|ment; that he would not enter into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion con|cerning the motives of the combined powers; but that for his part, he could have no &s;hare in le&s;&s;ening the territory of France, or employ either his influence, or his mode|rate talents, in that ta&s;k; and that therefore he felt him|&s;elf obliged to withdraw from the coalition, and mu&s;t be|&s;eech the Prince of Cobourg to grant him a pa&s;&s;port.</P>
<P>The Prince of Cobourg could not forbear to expre&s;s his high e&s;teem of his delicacy. The Arch Duke Charles, and Colonel Mack, al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed their e&s;teem for the ge|neral; and he departed for Bru&s;&s;els. Dumourier can have no doubt that, after a direct violation of the princi|ples of the treaty that had taken place, and after an open di&s;avowal of the proclamation i&s;&s;ued in con&s;equence of

that treaty, his pre&s;ence mu&s;t have been embarra&s;&s;ing to the Imperiali&s;ts, and that they regarded the re&s;olution he took with plea&s;ure. But it was not long that he left them in any perplexity, his re&s;olution was taken the moment he perceived ther de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Before Dumourier quitted the Imperial army, he had the &s;atisfaction of knowing that his former companions would be continued in their rank and employments. They are well treated and &s;erve in the Imperial army, where a&s;&s;uredly they will &s;upport their reputation.</P>
<P>Being arrived at Bru&s;&s;els, he explained the motives of his conduct to the Count de Metternich, the emperor's mini&s;ter in the Netherlands, who received him with the greate&s;t friend&s;hip, and gave him a pa&s;&s;port for Ger|many.</P>
<P>In this place the memoirs of the public life of General Dumourier are concluded. The remainder of his life has been filled up with difficulties, dangers, per&s;ecutions, and calumnies of every kind, of which he may one day render an account to the public.

<P>SUCH is the &s;eries of events in three of the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous months of General Dumourier's life. In this &s;hort period he has experienced all the mi&s;eries, and all the dangers, that the weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of man can inflict upon a public character. Calumny and inju&s;|tice form the outline of this dark picture, which may &s;erve as a le&s;&s;on to men of every de&s;cription, and from which philo&s;ophy alone can extract tho&s;e con&s;olatory reflections which propriety of conduct and rectitude of motive &s;upply. He hates, neither tho&s;e who have de|famed his character, nor tho&s;e who have pur&s;ued his life, nor tho&s;e who have refu&s;ed him an a&s;ylum, and who&s;e ungenerous and ill founded refentment per&s;ecutes him wherever he flies. The fir&s;t, are ignorant of the true &s;tate of tho&s;e facts, which, from their very &s;ingularity, are exceedingly liable to mi&s;repre&s;entation. The &s;econd,

are actuated by that &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, which is rea&s;on|able proof. The third, are prejudiced by calumny, and con&s;ider him as a dangerous character.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of foreign courts have given it out, after the Emigrants, that he is a proper object of &s;u&s;picion, and that they can never be &s;ure he will not veer about and put him&s;elf at the head of the French. His pro|&s;cription, and his three declarations, ought to be a &s;uffi|cient pledge of his firmne&s;s: tho&s;e three pieces have rai&s;ed him many enemies by the perver&s;e mi&s;con&s;truc|tion given to his expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>He avows that he pa&s;&s;ionately loves his country, and that he will never he&s;itate a moment to &s;acrifice his life to its welfare; but he declares, at the &s;ame time, that whil&s;t it is polluted with crimes, and delivered over to the horrors of anarchy, he will never enter it again: that, pro&s;cribed, as he is, and an outca&s;t of &s;ociety, he prefers all the mi&s;eries and all the dangers he may incur, to the mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ituation in which the oppre&s;&s;ors of his countrymen, and the inciters of their mad exce&s;&s;es, could place him.</P>
<P>He has been the open enemy of tho&s;e powers who wi&s;hed to interfere in the internal affairs of his country, both whil&s;t he was a mini&s;ter, and whil&s;t he was a gene|ral; becau&s;e he was mo&s;t firmly per&s;uaded, that the Revolution which was doubtle&s;s, expedient and inevi|table, would have been accompli&s;hed, not only with innocence, but glory, if foreign interference and the open incouragement given to the emigrants, had not exa&s;perated to madne&s;s a people by nature impetu|ous and violent. After licentiou&s;ne&s;s and anarchy had de&s;troyed every thing in France, he wi&s;hed to avail him|&s;elf of the &s;ame foreign powers to re-e&s;tabli&s;h order, not merely without injury to his country, but with the mo&s;t tender regard for its intere&s;t and its glory.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw that this became impracticable, he form|ed the plan of a diver&s;ion, by which he conceived he might e&s;&s;entially &s;erve the cau&s;e of his country and of Europe. Di&s;tru&s;t or other motives, prevented its exe|cution. He grieves at the protraction of the &s;ufferings of human nature: he fighs impatiently for the termina|tion of this cala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itious war, without fore&s;eeing the means of its accompli&s;hment, &mdash;for nothing which now takes place in Europe, with re&s;pect to France, can be rea&s;on|ed upon after the common maxims of policy and pru|dence.</P>

It has been &s;aid that he was bribed over by the Dutch Patriots, and afterward &s;old to the Prince of Orange a li&s;t of the principal con&s;pirators. This ab&s;urd imputa|tion appears in a German work on the French Revolu|tion, called Minerva, much e&s;teemed for the beauty of its &s;tyle. The author has certainly been deceived in this as well as in many other cicum&s;tances, of General Du|mourier's life, which the natural love of the marvellous has con&s;tantly magnified and blackened. He declares, that he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a li&s;t of the Dutch Patriots, that he knew only a very &s;mall party of the&s;e refugees in France, that he knew the&s;e only becau&s;e they formed a Batavian Revolutionary Committee at Antwerp; that he does not know the names of any of tho&s;e who may enter|tain the &s;ame opinions in Holland; that he has never had any communication, either before or &s;ince, with the Stadtholder's party; that it is even impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a communication &s;hould have exi&s;ted, as that court never forgave the manife&s;to which preceded his expedition into Holland; that he never received a bribe; that he is poor, and glories in being &s;o.</P>
<P>He will conclude the&s;e Memoirs with &s;ome observa|tions on the three cla&s;&s;es of French emigrants. Foreign|ers are &s;urpri&s;ed, that they &s;hould not unite in their di&s;|tre&s;s, becau&s;e they are unacquainted with their di&s;tingui&s;h|ing characters. Their divi&s;ions are a great misfortune, but they are almo&s;t without a remedy.</P>

Allured by the &s;eductive in|fluence of this party on the one hand, and terrified by the extravagance of the Jacobins on the other, the low no|ble&s;&s;e have been induced to join them in military array. This cla&s;s is compo&s;ed of pure Royali&s;ts: they wi&s;h and demand the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ancient monarchy, and of cour&s;e, of ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m; and regret the old in&s;ti|tutions with all their abu&s;es, in&s;titutions which it is im|po&s;&s;ible &s;hould ever re-appear, &s;ince a new order of things has rendered France no longer the France of former days, but a new nation, requiring as a new nation, a new mo|ral and political con&s;titution, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h on the broad ba&s;is of general utility the &s;ecurity of the government, and the confidence of the people.</P>

This cla&s;s includes all tho&s;e members of the National Convention who had the courage to vote in favour of Louis XVI. and again&s;t all the abomi|nations which re&s;ulted from his execution; and who, having atte&s;ted their wi&s;hes in a prote&s;t had the good for|tune to e&s;cape.</P>

The unju&s;t impri&s;onment of Fayette excites in their bo&s;oms no mercy for that unfortunate General.

<P>The intolerance of this cla&s;s of emigrants towards the two others precludes that union which is &s;o e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary in their pre&s;ent unfortunate &s;ituation, were it only to excite, the attention and compa&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal States where they have fled for protection, and rove without a &s;ettlement. There are notwith&s;tanding in this cla&s;s, &s;ome few individuals of &s;en&s;e borne away in the general ma&s;s by their unlucky &s;ituation, and the prejudices of their birth, who from an exception to the general rule, and &s;in|cerely reprobate the extravagance of the re&s;t, but they are little attended to. This cla&s;s is divided too, within it&s;elf, into factions as active, as intriguing, as full of bickerings and jealou&s;ies, as when it glittered at Paris or Ver&s;ailles. It is a court itinerant, which has lo&s;t nothing of its occu|pation, though deprived of its &s;tability.</P>
<P>The other two cla&s;&s;es of emigrants are infinitely more moderate and rea&s;onable, and might &s;oon be brought to coale&s;ce. Fayette and Dumourier, if they met in any other place than a pri&s;on, would &s;oon under&s;tand each other; and the &s;hades of difference, which have hitherto only &s;eparated them, perhaps for want of a due explana|tion, would melt away, and vani&s;h before the common in|tere&s;t of their country, and the common &s;ufferings of them|&s;elves. For the&s;e two chiefs, and the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es have both been &s;trenuous for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty in their country, and the reformation of abu&s;es.

<P>General Dumourier declares to the emigrants of every de&s;cription, whom force or inclination, has &s;eparated from their country, that it is only by a well cemented union they can acquire that con&s;ideration, which alone can bet|ter their &s;ituation at the clo&s;e of the war, whether they &s;ucceed in returning to their country, or whether they are

<P>Their unfortunate &s;ituation may continue a long time, it may become utterly without a remedy: the wor&s;t &s;hould always be &s;uppo&s;ed, that we may not be mi&s;led by falla|cious expectations.

<P>Bani&s;hment, like every other condition of human na|ture, has its advantages. It gives us objects of compari&s;on, of which we would never otherwi&s;e have an idea; it gives us information; it calls forth our energies by its difficul|ties; it renders us indulgent and &s;ociable, it excites be|tween our&s;elves and our protectors a reciprocation of &s;en|&s;ibility and benevolence. The upright man, the man of wi&s;dom and reflection, brings back from this involuntary pilgrimage, a &s;tore of tho&s;e hardy and of tho&s;e gentle vir|tues, which qualify him better to benefit his country, and lead to that univer&s;al philanthropy which dimi&s;hes the di&s;|mal effects of national partialities.</P>
<P>General Dumourier gives them another piece of advice, which he carefully ob&s;erves him&s;elf&mdash;to be indulgent to their countrymen, and not to revile a whole nation by too indi&s;criminate reproaches. It is <HI>imprudent,</HI> at lea&s;t, to brand as rebels twenty millions of men who ri&s;e again&s;t a hundred thou&s;and. The&s;e twenty millions form &s;uch an immen&s;e majority, that the hundred thou&s;and are more de|&s;erving of the name of rebels. The emigrants of every de&s;cription, who love their country, and are worthy of

returning to it, may fairly&mdash;under the di&s;mal apprehen|&s;ion, left anarchy &s;hould produce the total &s;ubver&s;ion and di&s;organization of the empire&mdash;may fairly dete&s;t five or &s;ix hundred &s;coundrels who lead that amiable people a&s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and hurry them beyond the rea&s;onable bounds of true liberty, of true patrioti&s;m, of fea&s;ible equality, and of the po&s;&s;ible means of public happine&s;s and order; but they &s;hould &s;urely pre&s;erve, in misfortune e&s;pecially, that love for their country which maintains their title to its bless|ing.</P>
<P>They &s;hould never calumniate the nation at large: they may ju&s;tly lament that the French are blindfolded, and led through crimes into every extravagance. But there is one point of view which is con&s;olatory to every true Frenchman: he &s;ees through all this anarchy, a mo&s;t de|termined courage, and the greate&s;t frankne&s;s of opinion. With the&s;e qualities the French may be brought back from their errors; but it is by rea&s;on, and not by reproaches, that this can be accompli&s;hed. Let tho&s;e among the emi|grants who&s;e &s;ituation, who&s;e influence, and who&s;e know|ledge, may one day call them to the important duty of re|e&s;tabli&s;hing order in France, let the&s;e men fit them&s;elves for reclaiming the public opinion, by in&s;tantly &s;acrificing their re&s;entment, of whatever nature, or however ju&s;t, and cea&s;ing to exa&s;perate by invectives the whole of, the peo|ple of France. The character of that people may be eclip&s;ed for a time, but will never be entirely obliterated, and what is crime in &s;ome few individuals, is energy in the nation at large.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the world does not pre&s;ent an in&s;tance of a nation a&s;&s;ailed by &s;o many enemies at once, le&s;s terrified at the thunder of the charge, or keeping them at bay in every quarter with &s;uch ob&s;tinate re&s;olution. The la&s;t campaign, which was enough to have cru&s;hed them at once, only di&s;played one general ma&s;s of valour; and if they yield, the next campaign, they will be &s;ubdued, but they will not be degraded. It is greatly the intere&s;t of the emigrants that the French &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed; for whatever their nation may &s;uffer in the e&s;timation of Eu|rope, will be a lo&s;s to them&s;elves. They have already, for the la&s;t two years, been guilty of a great mi&s;take in repre&s;enting to foreign powers that the French armies were contemptible, and utterly incapable of making any re&s;i&s;tance. This mi&s;take, which has proved &s;o fatal to the Pru&s;&s;ians, has taken away all credit from their reports. Let us never hear &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations again&mdash;They are much too &s;erious.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="026918_0254_0FD261D77059E248">
The French nation, collectively taken, will always be amiable. She is labouring at this moment under a moral di&s;temper, who&s;e dreadful convul&s;ions only render her a greater object of alarm. Foreigners may employ the &s;word, but her emigrant offspring &s;hould only approach her with the &s;oothing accents of per&s;ua&s;ion: &mdash; it is their intere&s;t to do &s;o: their de&s;ign of &s;uperinducing order on that confu&s;ion which has driven them from their country, will, otherwi&s;e, every month and every week, become more perfectly hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>This advice is not the re&s;ult of ba&s;e compliance, or per|&s;onal intere&s;t, or ambition. General Dumourier declares, and his Memoirs will prove, that he reprobates the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of things in France; that he &s;ees in them only the &s;ubver&s;ion of every rational principle, and the utter impracticability of promoting public happine&s;s; he de|clares, that he will never warp to &s;uch an order of things; and that he would chu&s;e beggary, pro&s;cription, wretched|ne&s;s and perpetual exile, in preference to any re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in his country that mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of his moral principles, &mdash; but he declares, too, that he loves his countrymen, and that were he poignarded in their delirium tomorrow, he would breathe out his la&s;t accents, in a lamentation of their errors, and a bene|diction to his country.</P>

<HEAD>Monthly Review. SAMUEL HARRISON SMITH, SUBMITS TO THE PATRONAGE OF THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES, THE RE-PUBLICATION OF THE MONTHLY REVIEW, ENLARGED.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;electing this work for the pre&s;s, the Publi&s;her's candor obliges him to &s;ay that views of a pecuniary com|plexion had a primary influence on his conduct; but his feelings will not permit him to withhold the de|claration that a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the many advantages at|tendant on its circulation, if it did not originate, at lea&s;t, fixed his wavering re&s;olution. Its &s;ub&s;ervience to the leading principles on which our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity depends, and on which alone our future well-being can be &s;ecured, renders it an object worthy of public regard. If the diffu&s;ion of the Monthly Review can be &s;hewn to carry with it the&s;e important benefits, the Printer cannot he&s;itate a moment in the a&s;&s;urance, that it will meet with a warm and general &s;upport. For the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who may not have an opportunity of recurring to the work it&s;elf, a &s;hort account of its nature, its tendency, and its execution, is pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>I. IT profe&s;&s;es to be a review of all the original publi|cations that appear in Great Britain, and &s;uch of tho&s;e written on the Continent as are deemed works of merit. In this review, the author's principles, talents, and infor|mation are te&s;ted by the rules of &s;cience and critici&s;m, a deci&s;ion is pronounced, which if equitably made, ei|ther holds forth his offspring to cordial patronage, or cold neglect. The reader of the Review is not dictated to by the writer of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and compelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="2" REF="026918_0256_0FD261D971379048">
to his opinion, through a deficiency of materials qualify|ing him to form a judgment him&s;elf; he is enabled to judge both of the merit of the original, and the ju&s;tice of the critici&s;m, by copious extracts, which are u&s;ually made from all works of an intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e performances, information and critici&s;m are happily blended. To u&s;eful and improving narrative are added intere&s;ting argument and &s;pirited di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; form|ing &s;o plea&s;ing an a&s;&s;emblage as to command the lively attention even of tho&s;e who&s;e impatience revolts at the labour of peru&s;ing a lengthy, &s;y&s;tematic work. The review of any publication, may be con&s;idered, if the phra&s;e be allowed, as its kernel, presenting its hidden trea&s;ures, without condemning the reader to the labour of exploring them. No evidence can be more conclu&s;ive of the charms this periodical work po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es than the e&s;ti|mation in which it is held in England. This e&s;timation will be be&s;t under&s;tood by an acquaintance with the en|couragement it receives. This &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of any other i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;s, except &s;uch as are intimately con|nected with religious duties.</P>
<P>II. IT is conducted with di&s;tingui&s;hed ability, and un|&s;haken impartiality. The liberal patronage which &s;u&s;|tains it, fo&s;ters the one, and in&s;ures the other. More than twenty thou&s;and di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;ons cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to unite in the &s;teady &s;upport of any object, with|out that object being both laudable and de&s;irable. By an cxten&s;ive circulation and corre&s;pondent encouragement, the proprietors are enabled to command the talents of men di&s;tingui&s;hed for their acqui&s;itions in the &s;everal de|partments of &s;cience and literature. The generous re|ward which talents thus exerted receive, aided by that &s;prit of independence which knowledge ever in&s;pires, rai&s;e the writers for this work above tho&s;e paltry temp|tations which &s;o often corrupt mean and unenlightened minds. The&s;e remarks are &s;trengthened in the highe&s;t degree, by a clo&s;e attention to the manner in which this
<PB N="3" REF="026918_0257_0FD261EEA5F18040">
performance has actually been executed. Few reflec|tions have been ca&s;t upon it, and of the&s;e few, mo&s;t of them exhibit the traits of mortified dulne&s;s. Tho&s;e works which have received the la&s;h of &s;everity from the Reviewers, have almo&s;t univer&s;ally retreated into ob&s;curity, while &s;uch as have been crowned with the meed of prai&s;e, have gradually rai&s;ed their heads and flouri&s;hed, in &s;pite of prejudiced or intere&s;ted oppo&s;ition. It is not contended, that this has been an univer&s;al effect; but it is averred to have been a general one.</P>
<P>III. THE Monthly Review from its commencement to the pre&s;ent day, has uniformly aided and &s;upported the cau&s;e of civil and religious liberty. In times, when freedom of expre&s;&s;ion apparently approached the verge of de&s;truction, when oppo&s;ition to the infatuated coun|cils of Britain, drew forth the vengeance of government, and endangered the exi&s;tence of the patriot, the authors of this publication, in&s;tead of yielding to the power that menaced them, &s;ummoned to their cau&s;e all the energy of indignant truth, and thereby formed a barrier to that &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which had begun to &s;pread it&s;elf among the people. During the American conte&s;t, they boldly pronounced the conduct of mini&s;ters to be replete with folly and depravity, and enjoyed the ultimate &s;atisfac|tion of beholding the nation pro&s;elytes to their &s;enti|ments. At the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, when in England liberty is in her la&s;t agonies, and &s;udden ruin threatens every man who dares to doubt the infallibility of the admi|ni&s;trators of her government, we ob&s;erve this work pre|&s;erving its wonted dignity: In &s;ome &s;mall degree, it is true, accommodating it&s;elf to the &s;pirit of the times, that prejudice may be more &s;ucce&s;sfully eradicated by appearing to yield to it. But never meanly applauding what rea&s;on mu&s;t condemn, never ba&s;ely courting the fa|vour of the powerful by panegyrizing their crimes: Avoiding the imputation of a ra&s;h intemperate zeal, at the &s;ame time that no &s;it occa&s;ion is &s;uffered to pa&s;s without a clear expo&s;ure of tho&s;e principles which con&s;titute the</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="026918_0258_0FD261DBA43A1028">
THESE ob&s;ervations have been made in order to draw the attention of Americans to a work, which, on account of its extent and the variety of printing in its execution (almo&s;t every kind of letter occurring) requires an exten|&s;ive patronage to compen&s;ate the expences of conducting it. They might be enlarged to a much greater extent&mdash; but every per&s;on who&s;e curio&s;ity is awakened, will find no difficulty in obtaining &s;atisfaction by an in&s;pection of the work it&s;elf, as it is much read notwith&s;tanding the heavy charges of importation.</P>
<P>THE Printer has but two additional remarks to make. Should that encouragement be received which the work is entitled to, he looks forward to the period as not a remote one, in which the publication &s;hall receive an acce&s;&s;ion of value, by a review of &s;uch original works as appear among our&s;elves. &mdash; The reduced price which the follow|ing terms fix, below that of the Engli&s;h edition, as well as the early and regular manner in which the American edition will be printed, &s;hould be influential induce|ments, added to others too obvious to be mentioned, to give a preference of our own manufactory to any foreign one.</P>

<HEAD>SAMUEL HARRISON SMITH <HI>Has ju&s;t Publi&s;hed,</HI> To be &s;old by all the Book&s;ellers, Letters from a Father to his Son, ON VARIOUS TOPICS, RELATIVE TO LITERATURE AND THE CONDUCT OF LIFE. By J. AIKIN, M. D.</HEAD>
<P>The following account of this performance is extracted from the Monthly Review.</P>
<P>"The ingenious and judicious author of the work now before us is &s;o &s;trongly convinced of the propriety of an exten&s;ion of the current plans of education, that, as we learn from the introductory letter, he has educated his &s;on, to whom the letters are addre&s;&s;ed, on a broad &s;cale, which has comprized many changes of discipline, and has em|braced a large field of in&s;truction. By the&s;e means, he has endeavoured to give the young man a comprehen&s;ive view of the objects before him, and to prepare him for the &s;tudy of books, of men, and of nature, as well as for the reputa|ble and u&s;eful di&s;charge of profe&s;&s;ional duties. In giving the fini&s;hing &s;troke to this important work of educating a &s;on, he addre&s;&s;es him in a &s;eries of letters, &s;upplementary to tho&s;e in&s;tructions, which he had received, in a &s;y&s;tema|tic way, from books and lectures. Pre&s;uming that his <HI>principles,</HI> in the cour&s;e of a liberal education, had been well e&s;tabli&s;hed, he writes, 'rather with a view to place in a &s;trong and familiar light &s;ome &s;ubordinate truths belong|ing to the experimental practice of life, which, though not of the &s;ame fundamental importance with principles, are of no &s;mall weight in promoting a man's happine&s;s and utility.' At the &s;ame time he communicates to him various ob&s;ervations on points of ta&s;te and literature, in which his chief aim has been to obviate prejudices, and to give that turn to his &s;on's thoughts which might enable him to judge and enjoy for him&s;elf, without fir&s;t appeal|ing to the deci&s;ion of a dictator. The letters, throughout,
<PB N="3" REF="026918_0261_0FD261F4F65F01A0">
encourage and recommend that freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, without which, as the author ju&s;tly remarks, no difference exi&s;ts between <HI>opinion</HI> and <HI>prejudice.</HI></P>
<P>The public is much indebted to Dr. Aikin for extend|ing the utility of the&s;e letters beyond his own family; for that young man mu&s;t have been very fortunately educated, and have made very extraordinary attainments, who can|not reap from them much improvement, as well as enter|tainment: nor is this publication by any means con&s;idered as peculiarly appropriated to the u&s;e of young men. The work being neither elementary nor &s;y&s;tematic, brings be|fore its readers a great variety of plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects; on all of which it leads them into important and curious inquiries, or induces a train of u&s;eful or amu&s;ing reflections. In this view, Dr. Aikin's publication may be con&s;idered as a valuable addition to the public &s;tock of mi&s;cellaneous e&s;&s;ays, moral and critical; for (u&s;ing the terms with &s;ome degree of latitude,) under the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es all the letters may be with propriety arranged."</P>
<P>After making &s;everal very lengthy extracts, the Re|viewers ob&s;erve: "I he diver&s;ified entertainment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ich this valuable production has enabled us to lay before our readers, will be a &s;ufficient apology for the length of the pre&s;ent article.
