<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE take the earlie&s;t opportunity after our being met together to give your excellency notice of it; and this we look upon to be the more nece&s;&s;ary &s;ince our conver&s;ing upon the &s;ubject of a future congre&s;s has occa&s;ioned an alteration of the place of meeting.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An alteration of place propo&s;ed.</NOTE> A change in every re&s;pect &s;o much more convenient to us, will, we flatter our&s;elves, not be otherwi&s;e to you; the di&s;tance will, we under&s;tand, be the &s;ame, and the accommodations no doubt better: It was the intention of &s;ome of us to have gone up Savannah river by water, but the tediou&s;ne&s;s of that pa&s;&s;age has deterred us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of go|ing by water,</NOTE> as the difficulty, if not impractica|bility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or by land, to Augu&s;ta.</NOTE> of conveying our&s;elves, and the nece&s;&s;ary conveniencies, by land, has made us lay a&s;ide all thoughts of this al&s;o. The behaviour of &s;ome of the Indians to the king's &s;ubjects,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the ill beha|viour of the Indians, point out the pro|priety of the altera|tion.</NOTE> and their ill di&s;po&s;ition towards one another, points out too the propriety, of a&s;&s;embling them at &s;ome place where they will be under a greater check and controul, than they would be in &s;o &s;traggling and ill-&s;ettled a place as Augu&s;ta: but with regard to the Indians them&s;elves, we imagine the alteration will not be di&s;agreeable; they were before appri&s;ed that Augu&s;ta was pitched upon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Small-pox in Ca|rolina, the rea&s;on why Augu&s;ta was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</NOTE> becau&s;e the &s;mall-pox was in Carolina; that di&s;order having long &s;ince cea&s;ed, will be rea&s;on therefore &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ign for the change of place. The Chactahs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">That ob&s;tacle now removed.</NOTE> Chica&s;ahs and Catawbas, are not at all likely to make objections; the Cherokees are extremely aver&s;e to going to Augu&s;ta; and if the Creeks &s;hould entertain any jealou&s;y, the &s;uperintendent will no doubt be able to convince them, that nothing is intended by the change of place, but to render the meeting more commodious to the governors, &s;ome of which have already come a great way, and will &s;uffer unavoidably by proceeding farther. Capt. Stuart will either lodge the pre&s;ents at Augu&s;ta, or order them back again, as may appear to him the mo&s;t proper, when he has &s;ounded the Indians on this &s;ubject. We &s;hould have been glad, if time would have permitted to have known your &s;entiments upon this alteration; but the day appointed draws &s;o near, that capt. Stuart thinks it proper to &s;et off on thur&s;day, in order to be ready to receive &s;uch Indians as may arrive. We are,</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received yours of the 4th in&s;tant, acquainting me with an intended alteration of the place of meeting to hold the future congre&s;s. The change, if to be in Charles-Town, is certainly more convenient and agreeable to you, and it ever gives me plea&s;ure, when, in executing any part of my duty, I can do it in &s;uch manner as may be mo&s;t agreeable to tho&s;e concerned; though I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the difficulties thrown in the way, I conceive (on a trial) would not have proved &s;o great as repre&s;ented or imagined.

As to any particular conve|nience or inconvenience to my&s;elf, I &s;et that quite out of the que&s;tion where his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice interferes; and although &s;ome, very few, of the upper Creek have mi&s;behaved lately, yet I am fully per&s;uaded, the meeting at Augu&s;ta would have been perfectly &s;afe, and all parties &s;ecure from danger. I wi&s;h the Creeks, &amp;c.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And &s;afe pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE> may be prevailed on to proceed any further than Augu&s;ta, but doubt very much whether they will. Mr. Stuart, in his letter to me, does not mention the lea&s;t difficulty or objection made by the Cherokees again&s;t Augu&s;ta, but that they had received his invitation with the greate&s;t cordiality and joy. And I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the Chactahs and Chica&s;ahs would have no objections to a &s;aving of three hundred miles travelling. You have omitted to mention the place, only in a po&s;t&s;cript &s;ay, "the Indians will be ordered to Dorche&s;ter." The time I pre&s;ume is now uncertain; but, when you are plea&s;ed to inform me of that and the place, I &s;hall certainly attend, if health permits.

<P>WE have this morning been favoured with your letter of the 8th in&s;tant, upon which we think it ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Augu&s;ta, its ac|commodations and &s;ecurity, mu&s;t have been mi&s;repre&s;ented to us; and be&s;ides, that the getting there at all,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of get|ing to Augu&s;ts very great.</NOTE> with the lea&s;t degree of convenience to our&s;elves, was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible. Mr. Stuart might have omitted acquainting your excellency with the di&s;inclination of the Cherokees to meet at Augu&s;ta,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cherokees di&s;inclined to meet there, and propo&s;e Saludy old-town for the congre&s;s.</NOTE> in con&s;equence of two of their nation being killed by the Creeks; but they expre&s;&s;ed it &s;trongly to him, propo&s;ed Saludy old-town for the congre&s;s, and determined to wait on the path in hopes of an alteration of place. We are in great hopes, that the late outrages committed by the upper Creeks are not the acts of the nation in general;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations on the conduct of the Creek Indians.</NOTE> but, if the generality were well inclined, they would either prevent, or puni&s;h, &s;uch frequent repetitions of in&s;olence and murder. A letter of the 4th in&s;tant, which governor Boone has received from Augu&s;ta,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Information re|ceived that the Up|per-Creeks would not come at all.</NOTE> &s;ays, that none of the Creeks will be there, at the congre&s;s; if this was their re&s;olution before the place of meeting was changed, it looks as if they could not hope, that their offences would be forgiven them: With regard to the Chactahs and Chica&s;ahs, they are already on their route;

<P>LAST night I received a letter, &s;ent by an expre&s;s, from Augu&s;ta, informing me,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He &s;ays, the Wolf king is gone to Pen|&s;acola&mdash;a bad omen&punc;</NOTE> that the Wolf king was gone to Pen&s;acola, to make &s;ome demands relative to the ceded lands; and giving an account of the &s;ituation of affairs in the upper Creeks, which, to &s;ay no more, I think have not a very plea&s;ing a&s;pect,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calls his council, on the pre&s;ent criti|cal &s;ituation of In|dian affairs.</NOTE> and made me determine to call the gentlemen of the council together, for their opinion on the pre&s;ent appearance of things among&s;t the Indians, and what may be mo&s;t proper to be done, for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in general, and the &s;afety of this province in particular, in ca&s;e Mr. Stuart cannot prevail on the Creeks to proceed to Dorche&s;ter or Charles-Town. My la&s;t, by Joyner, I wrote immediately on the receipt of yours, on a &s;uppo&s;ition, and in hopes, that Mr. Stuart might prevail with the Creeks to proceed down: but, on the receipt of my letters la&s;t night, I began to reflect more fully on the con&s;equence of their refu&s;ing to go any further; and the more I reflect on the critical &s;ituation of affairs with the&s;e Indians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Much evil to be expected, if the In|dians return in di&s;|gu&s;t.</NOTE> the more I am convinced of the danger that, in all probability, will attend their returning home di&s;gu&s;ted; and I very much fear they will not go down to Dorche&s;ter; they are not in a &s;ituation or humour to follow orders.&mdash;Nay, I am apprehen&s;ive, if they &s;hould hear of an intention to carry them down to Charles-Town, they will not come even to Augu&s;ta, and therefore I have now wrote to lieutenant Barnard and Mr. Galphin, de&s;iring them to give Mr. Stuart their be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the affair &mdash; Gentlemen at a di&s;tance, may not &s;ee or con&s;ider this matter in the light it &s;trikes me; and a Creek war, may be as litle felt in Virginia, as the northern ma&s;&s;acres are in this province; our commi&s;eration is of little &s;ervice to tho&s;e who feel and &s;uffer; even North and South Carolina would feel little or nothing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rupture with the Creeks, in compari&s;on of this province: I mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider this matter in a more &s;erious light than you may; and, it is to be pre&s;umed, I am better acquainted with their &s;ituation, and our own, than gentlemen at a greater di&s;tance. And his maje&s;ty's council are unanimou&s;ly and clearly of opinion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The council ad|vi&s;e him to meet the &s;avages at Augu&s;ta.</NOTE> that, &s;hould the Creek Indians refu&s;e to go down to Charles-Town, and return back from Augu&s;ta di&s;plea&s;ed, at this critical conjuncture, it might be productive of the wor&s;t con&s;equences, to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in general, and the &s;afety of this province in particular; and therefore, in order to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the dangers that may attend their returning di&s;gu&s;ted, have advi&s;ed me, in ca&s;e the Indians refu&s;e to proceed to Charles-Town, to meet them at Augu&s;ta, as the be&s;t, if not the only, method, to prevent further mi&s;under&s;tandings with them, and to promote his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t gracious intentions, and e&s;tabli&s;hing peace and friend&s;hip with them on a more firm ba&s;is.</P>
<P>This advice entirely coincides with my own opinion; and I judge it altogether expedient for me to go up to Augu&s;ta to meet them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He agrees with his council in that point.</NOTE> in ca&s;e they will not proceed to Charles-Town, and can be prevailed on to wait at Augu&s;ta.</P>
<P>I &s;end a per&s;on expre&s;s to acquaint your excellencies with this matter. If the Indians in general go to Charles-Town, I &s;hall attend the congre&s;s there: If they will not go, it then &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to proceed to Augu&s;ta,

<OPENER><DATELINE>Fort Augu&s;ta, <DATE>15th October, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I GOT to this fort the 11th current,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only 60 Indians (Catawbas) at Au|gu&s;ta, the 11th of October.</NOTE> where I found no other Indians than about &s;ixty Catawbas, including women and children, who had been here about two days before my arrival. On the thirteenth, in the morning, I received a letter, by expre&s;s, from lieutenant Taylor, dated 10th, referring me to the intelligence contained in the inclo&s;ed letter to your excellency, and which I imagine contains full accounts of what pa&s;&s;es in that nation. I likewi&s;e &s;end a duplicate of the talk &s;ent here from the lower Creeks, by the me&s;&s;enger of whom Mr. Camp|bell wrote you,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little hopes of getting the &s;avages to Dorche&s;ter.</NOTE> with lieutenant Barnard's an&s;wer; by which your excellency, and the other governors, will be able to judge of their temper, and which gave me bad hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in endeavouring to per&s;uade them to go further.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An upper Creek warrior, &amp;c. arrive 14th Oct and with them the Chica&s;ah leader, and a princi|pal headman of the Chactahs.</NOTE> Ye&s;terday in the morning, the upper Creek warrior Mu&s;ti&s;icah, with the &s;econd man of the Tuckabatchies, and a number of their followers, came here; with them were, the leader of the Chica&s;ahs, Pia-mattah; one con&s;iderable leading man of the Chactah nation called Red-Shoes, and about twenty Chica&s;ahs of note, and their followers: Colbert, who had arrived &s;ome days before them, informed me, that his reception, in the Chactah nation, had been mo&s;t friendly; that many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t them had determined to accompany him down, but upon receiving news that two of their people were killed by the Creeks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Chactahs kil|led by the Creeks.</NOTE> none thought proper to venture except this Red-Shoes. Colbert adds, that the treatment which he and the Chica&s;ahs received,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creeks in&s;olent to the Chica&s;ahs &amp; Col|bert their interpreter</NOTE> in their way through the Creek nation, was extremely in&s;olent, and had made tho&s;e Indians extremely anxious to return home; accordingly, they pre&s;&s;ed me much to di&s;patch them: I invited them to come to the fort this day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chica&s;ahs, Creeks and Catawbas ac|quainted with the change of place.</NOTE> with the Catawbas and Creeks; I acquainted them with the alteration of the place of meeting propo&s;ed, and the rea&s;ons for it. The Chica&s;ah leader &s;aid, he had come a great way upon my invitation, and found him&s;elf di&s;appointed;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chica&s;ah leader re|fu&s;es to go further, yet not di&s;plea&s;ed.</NOTE> that he was too much tired to go any farther, and &s;hould return without taking any thing ami&s;s; that &s;uch accidents were often not to be avoided; that he was glad he had &s;een me; and whenever he &s;hould promi&s;e me any thing, I might depend upon meeting with no di&s;appoint|ment. The next who &s;poke, was the &s;econd man of the Creeks, who &s;aid, that he had come punctually at the time, and to the place of appointment, and ex|pected to have &s;een the governors; that it was their hunting &s;ea&s;on, when they &s;hould have been in the woods providing for their families, but that their time was taken up in this vi&s;it, which they &s;hould not think lo&s;t, if I would deliver the king's talk to them, and di&s;patch them immediately; that &s;everal of their own people had promi&s;ed to attend the meeting, who were not come, but that it &s;eemed to be the pre&s;ent prevailing cu&s;tom for men to &s;peak with two tongues. 
<PB N="11" REF="009706_0011_0F7A465F9DAEE080">
I repeated the rea&s;ons for altering the place of meeting, which I enlarged upon as much as the &s;ubject would admit, and de&s;ired they would let me know, after con&s;idering the affair maturely, whether or not they would go to Dorche&s;ter: they did not he&s;itate a moment, but po&s;itively refu&s;ed to go one &s;tep further.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creeks al&s;o refu&s;e to go further.</NOTE> I then a&s;ked, if they would &s;tay here 'till the return of a me&s;&s;enger I &s;hould &s;end to the governors? this, with great difficulty, the Creeks were prevailed upon to con&s;ent to: they have agreed to wait here ten days,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">At la&s;t agree to wait ten days for the return of an expre&s;s.</NOTE> at the expiration of which time, if they do not &s;ee the governors, or receive the king's me&s;&s;age from me, they are infallibly to go away. Lieutenant Barnard &s;ends an expre&s;s to governor Wright, who will be acquainted with what has pa&s;&s;ed, about the time this reaches your excellency's hands. The bearer, Kaltei&s;en, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as undertaken to carry this with the greate&s;t di&s;patch, and by him I beg to be favoured with your determination. By all the intelligence I can pick up from the traders, the Creeks were never more di&s;po&s;ed to a rupture,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creeks &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed for war.</NOTE> than at this time; and as tho&s;e who are now here, and who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t affected to us of any, are &s;o jealous, there cannot be any room to hope, that others, who are hourly expected here, will con&s;ent to go down to Dorche&s;ter: they are con&s;cious of their bad behaviour,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Pa&s;t ill be|haviour makes them afraid to tru&s;t them|&s;elves further in the &s;et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lements.</NOTE> and (upon Indian principles) do not choo&s;e to put them&s;elves any more in our power, by going further into the &s;ettlements. The Wolf, and a deputation of leading men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A party of them gone to Pen&s;acola, to pre&s;cribe bounds to the Engli&s;h there.</NOTE> are now gone to Pen&s;acola, to circum&s;cribe the limits of the garri&s;on within &s;uch a narrow compa&s;s as will hardly allow them garden room.</P>
<P>The Chica&s;ahs knew the determination of the Creeks to go no farther than this place (as all the Indians had received intimation of the alteration propo&s;ed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They were before apprized of the alte|ration of place.</NOTE> and had con&s;ulted upon it, before they &s;poke with me). Pia mattah con&s;idered, that,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chiea&s;ah leader's remark, in ca&s;e the Creeks &s;hould return di&s;gu&s;ted.</NOTE> if the Creeks &s;hould return di&s;gu&s;ted, it would be dangerous for him and his people to remain here, and return through their country after them; it was from this con&s;ideration that he refu&s;ed to go down, although he has many other objections of &s;eeming weight, which, however, I &s;hould have got the better of, if this material one had not occurred.</P>
<P>I find it ab&s;olutely impracticable to &s;atisfy the&s;e Indians now here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impo&s;&s;ible to &s;atis|fy the Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sir Jeffery Amher&s;t's allowance of provi|&s;ions.</NOTE> with the allowance of provi&s;ions &s;tipulated by Sir Jeffery Amher&s;t. They have always been u&s;ed to a very different treatment; and &s;uch an innovation, introduced by me, would give a very unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of me at my fir&s;t entrance on the execution of my office; be&s;ides, they would be di&s;gu&s;ted,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such an innovation, at this time, would be dangerous.</NOTE> and would probably go off; which I would by all po&s;&s;ible means avoid, 'till I am made acquainted with the determination of your&s;elf and the other governors, it being the general opinion of people here, that, in &s;uch an event, a Creek war would immediately take place, and by the intelligence I can procure I think it probable they are right.</P>
<P>Matters being in this &s;ituation, I have not &s;ent any directions for the boats with the pre&s;ents to return, becau&s;e that may be done in &s;ufficient time, after the return of the expre&s;s, for them to be at Dorche&s;ter, if any congre&s;s do take place there.

<P>I HAD the honour to receive yours of the 14th in&s;tant la&s;t night, by colonel Randolph, and another this morning by Joyner. And had the Indians pro|ceeded down to Dorche&s;ter, I &s;hould have &s;et off immediately for Charles-Town, in order to have contributed, to the utmo&s;t of my power, every thing that might appear nece&s;&s;ary on the occa&s;ion: but this morning I received letters from Augu&s;ta, in which Mr. Stuart acquaints me, <Q>That, after explaining to the Indians the motives that induced the governors to alter the place of meeting, he put the que&s;tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indians flatly refuse to proceed to Dorche&s;ter.</NOTE> whether or not they would proceed to Dorche&s;ter? to which both the Chica&s;ahs and Creeks an&s;wered flatly in the negative; that he then de&s;ired to know, if they would wait the return of an expre&s;s, which he would immediately di&s;patch to the governors? which they al&s;o at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, but, after much per&s;ua&s;ion, he had prevailed on them to wait the ten days; at the expiration of which time they will undoubtedly go away, if none of the governors get there.</Q></P>
<P>I am therefore to acquaint your excellencies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Wright there|fore continues deter|mined for Augu&s;ta.</NOTE> that, agreeable to what I wrote you in my la&s;t, I &s;hall proceed to Augu&s;ta, in&s;tead of doing my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of waiting upon you in Charles-Town.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST night I was honoured with your excellencies letter of 15th current, inclo&s;ing a copy of governor Wright's letter of 11th and your an&s;wer; and before now governor Boone mu&s;t have received my letter of 16th, by expre&s;s, in which I fully informed him of my tran&s;actions with the Indians, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lower Creeks and Cherokees expected at Augu&s;ts 20th of October.</NOTE> and of their ab&s;olute refu&s;al to proceed to Dorche&s;ter. The lower Creeks and Cherokees will be here this day, being only a few miles off. The upper Creeks, of whom a con&s;iderable number are here, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upper Creeks per|&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olu|tion, which governs the Chica&s;ahs.</NOTE> remain firm in their determination to proceed no further into the &s;ettlements, and their re&s;olution will determine the Chica&s;ahs.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009706_0018_0F7A4664E0BF8B80">
A regard to your excellencies conveniency, induced me to acquie&s;e in your propo&s;al of altering the place of meeting, and to u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to reconcile the Indians to that mea&s;ure, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Stuart &s;u&s;pects the Indians to be privately tampered with by the traders.</NOTE> although I then expre&s;&s;ed a doubt of being able to prevail on the Creeks to proceed further into the &s;ettlements, having had no intelligence from the upper Creeks, Chactahs, and Chica&s;ahs, or an&s;wer to the invitation I &s;ent them, on the part, and by order, of the king, to meet your excellencies and me, upon the &s;pecial &s;ervice we have in charge. I could not be certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and I did not doubt but your excellencies had re&s;olved on the mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued by you in ca&s;e of a di&s;appointment. I am con&s;cious of having done my duty, by endeavouring to remove their jealou&s;ies, and u&s;ing every argument that occurred to me, to induce them to proceed. If the Indians be privately tampered with (which I &s;u&s;pect) it mu&s;t be by the traders, the very channel through which I am obliged to conver&s;e with them. My be&s;t endeavours to engage the good offices of the traders, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And doubts his own influence as &s;u|perintendent.</NOTE> on this occa&s;ion, have and &s;hall not be wanting; but my influence may po&s;&s;ibly be very in&s;ufficient, for, as matters are now &s;ituated, they have nothing to fear or hope from my authority as &s;uper|intendent: but perhaps Mr. Wright's endeavours may be more efficacious, and I learn that he is &s;oon expected.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as I &s;hall u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to accompli&s;h what I came about, if I fail, I hope to be free from cen&s;ure and blame.</P>

19th. I arrived in the Oakchoys, and called all the headmen of the upper Creeks together, and was well treated there by pointing their guns at me.</P>
<P>23d. I &s;et out for the Chactah nation. On the way I met with Mr. John Buckles, and three Chactahs, one of which went back with me.</P>
<P>29th. I arrived in the Chactah nation; and on my arrival I called all the headmen of the Chactahs together, and there delivered my me&s;&s;age: but none of the headmen of the French party would come to hear it. The talk was very agreeable to them of the Engli&s;h party, and they all with one con&s;ent agreed to come down.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 3d. I arrived in the Chica&s;ah nation. Two days before my arrival there, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chactah killed by the Creeks.</NOTE> there came a Chactah fellow from the Breed camp, giving an account, that the Creeks had killed the Chactah that went to the Breed camp with Mr. Buckles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chica&s;ah kill three French men, a Indian women, and take a negro boy.</NOTE> and that he, the &s;ame fellow, narrowly made his e&s;cape. Four Chica|&s;ahs that had been at war, and having &s;trayed from the re&s;t of their gang, came on a camp of people, and killed three Frenchmen and two Indian women, and took a negro boy alive.</P>
<P>On the 5th of Augu&s;t. I had a talk with the headmen of the Chica&s;ahs, and they were all agreed thereto.</P>
<P>12th. A runner came to me from the Chactahs, and acquainted me, that none of them would go down, on account of the Creeks being at war with them.</P>
<P>13th. This day I &s;ent a runner back. And on the 22d I received an an&s;wer, that none of them would go down, by rea&s;on of the Creeks killing one of their people, and threatening de&s;truction to them all; and that, if they &s;hould go down, it might be a detriment to their brethren the Chica&s;ahs, for which rea&s;on they referred it, and concluded to go to war, to take &s;atisfaction for the man <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chica&s;ahs de|termine to go to war again&s;t the Creeks.</NOTE> they lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 25th. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three traders killed by the Creeks, and their goods taken.</NOTE> News came from the Creeks, that three white men were killed, and all their goods taken; and that the Mortar threatened to kill every white man that &s;hould come up to the Chica&s;ah nation.</P>
<P>28th. A headman came from the Chactahs, and de&s;ired the Chica&s;ahs to act for them as they would for them&s;elves, and the Chactahs would &s;tand to every thing or propo&s;al, the &s;ame as if they them&s;elves were pre&s;ent. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chactahs re|que&s;t the Chica&s;ahs to act for them at the congre&s;s.</NOTE></P>

<P>September 17th. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creeks threa|ten to kill the Chi|ca&s;ahs.</NOTE> I arrived at the Breed camp, and there met with very bad talks, hearing of the Creeks threatening to kill the Chica&s;ahs.</P>

<P>25th. I arrived in the Waukakoes, with the Chica&s;ahs, and was well treated there.</P>
<P>26th. I arrived in the Oakchoys, with the Chica&s;ahs. And there I invited

<HEAD>Fort AUGUSTA, WEDNESDAY November 9th.</HEAD>
<P>AT a full congre&s;s of the Governors, Superintendent, Indians, &amp;c. the replies were delivered as follows.</P>
<P>ANSWER of the &s;everal governors and the &s;uperintendent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reply to the Chi|ca&s;ahs talk.</NOTE> to Pia-Mattah the Chica&s;ah leader's talk.</P>
<Q><P>Friend, brother, and ally,</P>
<P>WE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their conduct ap|proved.</NOTE> the &s;everal governors and &s;uperintendent, are extremely plea&s;ed with the talk you delivered the day before ye&s;terday; as our elde&s;t brother you began replying, and gave an example to the other Indians; your talk was as &s;trait, and as grateful, as your conduct has been for the&s;e many years; we ac|knowledge your fidelity; we have had repeated proofs it, and we hope that by this meeting the chain of friend&s;hip, which has long united us, will receive ad|ditional &s;trength and brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>The words you have uttered are tho&s;e of a wi&s;e and generous man; and &s;uch as experience has taught you; you ob&s;erve, that you cannot do without the white people; this is mo&s;t certainly true&punc; but it is as certain, that by pre&s;erving

You &s;ay that the number of traders which pa&s;s through your country to the Chactahs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their objection to the number of tra|ders an&s;wered.</NOTE> and the too great num|ber which trade with your people, breed di&s;turbances, which you may not always be at hand to prevent. You now &s;hall have a reply to both tho&s;e remarks. By the ce&s;&s;ion of Mobile to the Engli&s;h, the Chactah trade will be carried on from thence, becau&s;e it will be more convenient to both Engli&s;h and Indians, &s;o that from this time you will have no complaints of that kind to make. Your other reque&s;t, that Heyrider and Brown only &s;hould traffic among you, has been con&s;idered by us as your friends, and we are per&s;uaded that &s;ome white man for his own intere&s;t has impo&s;ed upon you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons given why a few will not be advantageous for them.</NOTE> You may believe us as the great king's beloved men, that where the trade is in few hands the prices of goods are always higher; but if you give a preference to the traders you have mentioned, you are under no obligation to buy goods of others; if Heyrider and Brown are your friends, deal with them only; but they are more likely to continue to u&s;e you well, when you have other traders to re&s;ort to, in ca&s;e they abu&s;e you. This advice comes from us all, and we give it, becau&s;e we e&s;teem and value you. We have nothing further to add, but that you may &s;afely rely on the continuance of that friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the great king has always given you.</P></Q>
<P>With which they &s;eemed &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Previous to the an&s;wer to the Creeks, Forre&s;t (the interpreter) being de&s;ired to a&s;k Capt. Aleck, on behalf of him&s;elf and brothers, if he under&s;tood the line as &s;ettled ye&s;terday? he an&s;wered in the affirmative. Then the reply was proceeded on, viz.</P>

<P>In your an&s;wers to the talk delivered from him, you mention two points, to each of which you will now receive particular an&s;wers. The fir&s;t relates to the trade carried on between the white people and your towns; the other to the lands on which the white people are &s;ettled. As to the trade, you have goods &s;ent among you by almo&s;t all the colonies over which we pre&s;ide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why few traders go among&s;t them.</NOTE> but the prices you are inclined to give for goods are &s;o &s;mall, that few traders choo&s;e to carry goods into your towns: You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that if traders do not make an advantage of their goods, they will not carry them; you would do the &s;ame your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009706_0036_0F7A46760DAFDC48">
The trade of South Carolina &s;tands on another footing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And why a factory was &s;ettled at Kee|howee.</NOTE> At the time the path into your towns was but lately cleared from blood; to pre&s;erve it clean, to pre|vent the &s;ame mi&s;chiefs from being repeated, which had been occa&s;ioned by the madne&s;s of your young men, and the mi&s;behaviour of our traders, a factory was &s;ettled at Keehowee, and a trader whom we can depend upon for u&s;ing you well e&s;tabli&s;hed there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keehowee a plen|tiful and cheap place for goods.</NOTE> plenty of goods are con&s;tantly kept for your &s;upply, and the price as low or lower than any private trader can afford them: This regulation the province of South Carolina cannot alter, becau&s;e it has been laid before the king; it is in his power, and in his alone, to make an alteration; and until this is done, South-Carolina has not the power of lending private traders.</P>

<P>We &s;hall now come to the other point relative to lands.

In order to comply &s;trictly with the great king's in&s;tructions, copies of which you have among you, and that we may in no &s;hape deceive you, we will explain the &s;tate of tho&s;e &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>By a former governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lands run out explained.</NOTE> and above twenty &s;ince, a large grant of lands in that part of the country was made to one col. Patten, who under that grant &s;old out parcels of the land to people who &s;ettled there: In the&s;e &s;ettlements you have acquie&s;ced without complaint to this time, as they are at a great di&s;tance from your country. Another large grant was al&s;o made by the great king ju&s;t before the breaking out of the war with the French; but tho&s;e di&s;turbances prevented many per&s;ons &s;ettling un|der that grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No intru&s;ion upon them made or in|tended.</NOTE> and by the king's late in&s;tructions to the governor of Virginia no land can be granted even &s;o far as the ea&s;tern banks of that river. And in obe|dience to that in&s;truction not a foot has been &s;ince granted upon that river, &s;o that you have nothing further to apprehend on that account. And we now take this opportunity to confirm you in your &s;ecurity, by a&s;&s;uring you, that on the return of the governor of Virginia into his colony, all treaties will be carefully examined, and punctually ob&s;erved, and you may depend on &s;trict ju&s;tice being done to you. It is po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome idle per&s;ons may &s;it down on lands without any authority whatever:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Any idle people &s;ettling upon them to be removed on complaint made.</NOTE> But this you ought not to con&s;ider as an act of the government, which does not nor ever will countenance and protect people &s;ettling in that manner, but heartily concur with you in removing them on complaint made by you to the governor for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the king's commands,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Letter to the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate</NOTE> &s;ignified to us &s;everally by your lord|&s;hip, by letter of the 16th of March, we have met the different chiefs of the Chica&s;ahs, Cherokees, Creeks, Chactahs and Catawbas, and have u&s;ed our utmo&s;t endeavours to carry his maje&s;ty's intentions into execution.</P>
<P>The removal of the French and Spaniards from the ceded places, which your lord&s;hip meant the Indians &s;hould be apprized of by us, they were before ac|quainted with; this was unavoidable; the di&s;patching of invitations to nations &s;o remote as the Chactahs and Chica&s;ahs, nece&s;&s;arily took up a great deal of time, their con&s;ultations upon them not much le&s;s, and their journey hither &s;till more; however, my lord, we do not apprehend, that their receiving the above intelli|gence from other hands has been detrimental to the king's &s;ervice. The Chica|&s;ahs, ever faithful to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, are perfectly &s;atisfied with the change. The Chactah leader, now in confederacy with the Chica&s;ahs, had before made repeated offers of declaring again&s;t the French, provided he was &s;upplied with Engli&s;h goods; and &s;eems well plea&s;ed with the neighbourhood of the Engli&s;h, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had before courted: We have, in our reply to him, given him rea&s;on to expect, that, by the time he reaches home, there will be traders in his nation by the way of Mobile; and we beg leave to recommend to your lord&s;hip, that the Chactahs be &s;upplied with goods from that quarter, as a mea|&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to confirm them in their pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ions, and to render them independent of the Creeks, again&s;t whom they may be a very u&s;eful check when their &s;upplies are no longer &s;o precarious, as they now are by pa&s;&s;ing through the Creek country. The Creeks had been repre&s;ented to be very ill di&s;po&s;ed, the murders they had committed were frequent, and even &s;ub&s;equent to the receipt of your lord&s;hip's letter; and even &s;ince the holding of the congre&s;s, though amply &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, they have been accu&s;ed of wantonly killing the people's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; yet their talks have been more friendly than we expected, and their voluntary offer of an augmentation of boundary to Georgia, upon the king's forgivenne&s;s of all pa&s;t injuries being &s;ignified to them, &s;uppo&s;ing their profe&s;&s;ions &s;incere, and the chiefs of con&s;equence enough to act for the whole nation, which they declare they do, is certainly as &s;trong a proof as they can at pre&s;ent give of their good-will, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to mention to your lord&s;hip, that we have been privately cautioned, by the leader of the Chica&s;ahs, again&s;t confiding in the Creek profe&s;&s;ions; he &s;ays he knows them, that nothing done here will be confirmed by the ab&s;ent leaders, in compari&s;on of whom the pre&s;ent chiefs are in|con&s;iderable: The Cherokees, in their intelligence, have gone &s;till farther, but as they &s;eem on the point of a war with the Creeks, their te&s;timony is to be &s;u&s;|pected. Though the talks will convey to your lord&s;hip our opinions of the

different di&s;po&s;itions or the Indians, yet we thought nece&s;&s;ary to add thus much, and to acquaint your lord&s;hip, that the Cherokees &s;eem very pacific, but morti|fied at the refu&s;al of traders from South-Carolina, which the act now in force there prevents their being gratified with. And we beg leave to ob&s;erve to your lord&s;hip on this head, that the general promi&s;e of goods which we have made, by the king's orders, to the re&s;pective Indians, requires &s;uch a performance as it is impo&s;&s;ible, circum&s;tanced as we are, to be an&s;werable for, for we have no coer|cive power over traders. Your lord&s;hip will pardon us for &s;ugge&s;ting, that there never was a time more &s;ea&s;onable, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the commerce with In|dians, upon a general, &s;afe, equitable footing, and which we are afraid will never be done by re&s;pective provinces. The Catawbas boundary as before agreed upon, is now confirmed, and they are well &s;atisfied with it. Permit us to refer your lord&s;hip, for all further particulars of the congre&s;s, to the original papers which we &s;hall have the honour of tran&s;mitting with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, and to hope that we have faithfully executed the king's commands, and approved our&s;elves,</P>
