<P>But will God in very deed dwell on earth? Behold the heaven, and heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much le&s;s this hou&s;e that I have built?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Jewi&s;h nation were now a&s;&s;embled at Jeru&s;alem, to devote the Temple they had built there to an ob&s;ervance of the public &s;ervices of piety; and king Solomon, in their name, and as their mouth, adores that glo|rious being, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, humbly &s;upplicating that he would graci|ou&s;ly conde&s;cend to hearken to the cry of his peo|ple when they &s;hould pray to him in this hou&s;e: in imitation of &s;o pious an example, let us, upon our return to our hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, after long ab&s;ence, to make way for its being &s;o repaired as to be comfortable and convenient; let us, I &s;ay, make it our prayer, that the God who dwelleth on high would hearken to our &s;upplications when we pray
<PB N="6" REF="018953_0004_0FA9064777CB6E98">
in this place, and that his ears may be open, both night and day, to hear in heaven, and do for us according to the greatne&s;s of his mercy in Chri&s;t. And, as we are now a&s;&s;embled to pay a religious regard to the public offices of piety, may it plea&s;e God to enable you, with an engaged &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, to attend to what may now be offered to lead you, &s;o far as I am able, into an intelligible, though inadequate idea of the truth meant, when it is &s;aid of God, in my text, that <HI>the heaven of heavens can|not contain him, much le&s;s any hou&s;e built with hands</HI>; and to &s;hew you that this is a real truth. I &s;hall be as brief as po&s;&s;ible upon the&s;e points, that I may have time and &s;trength to enlarge upon &s;uch re|flections as are important in them&s;elves, and may be &s;ea&s;onable for us to con&s;ider and improve under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this method I would begin with &s;aying, that, when God is repre&s;ented as not con|tained in the heaven of heavens, much le&s;s in any hou&s;e built with hands, his OMNIPRESENCE is the truth intended to be conveyed. It would be a wrong &s;entiment of God, &s;hould we conceive of him as confined to heaven, or earth, or any particular place in the&s;e worlds; for he is, if I may &s;o &s;peak, diffu&s;ed all over heaven and earth, yea, all parts of the univer&s;e; in&s;omuch, that he is no where excluded, but as truly pre&s;ent in every place, as in any place at all. It may &s;eem to us, as though the &s;pace that is occupied by created bodies and &s;pirits would exclude the pre&s;ence of God, at lea&s;t from the&s;e parts of &s;pace. But this is owing to our ignorance of God, our incapacity of conceiving ju&s;tly of the MANNER in which
<PB N="7" REF="018953_0005_0FA9064788E1DD60">
he exi&s;ts. He exi&s;ts in all other exi&s;tencies. His pre&s;ence pervades their very ESSENCE. There is no &s;uch thing as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exi&s;tence where God is not pre&s;ent; there is no going where he is not. To this purpo&s;e is that beautifully &s;triking language of the in&s;pired David, in the 139th P&s;alm, <HI>Whither &s;hall I go from thy &s;pirit? or whither &s;hall I flee from thy pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there: if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermo&s;t parts of the &s;ea, even there &s;hall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand &s;hall hold me. If I &s;ay, &s;urely the darkne&s;s &s;hall co|ver me, even the night &s;hall be light about me; yea, the darkne&s;s bideth not from thee, but the night &s;hineth as the day: the darkne&s;s and the light are both alike to thee.</HI>" The pre&s;ence of God knows no bounds. It is not limited to this or any of the other worlds that con&s;titute the univer&s;e. Tho&s;e, we have abundant rea&s;on to believe, are va&s;tly nu|merous, as well as large, taking up an inconceiva|ble extent of &s;pace. But we may not think, that they are the boundaries or limits of the Deity's pre&s;ence. He not only fills the&s;e worlds, and every place in them, but that whole extra mun|dane &s;pace in which almighty power might &s;till be di&s;played in making new worlds beyond the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of the imagination of men or angels.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures, it is true, &s;peak of God as <HI>dwel|ling in heaven,</HI> and <HI>coming down from heaven to earth.</HI> It repre&s;ents him as having had his <HI>re&s;i|dence in the tabernacle</HI> erected by Mo&s;es; and as leaving that, and taking up his <HI>abode</HI> in the <HI>temple</HI> that was built by Solomon. But the&s;e are figu|rative
<PB N="8" REF="018953_0006_0FA90648A5792F78">
modes of expre&s;&s;ion, not intended to lead us into an apprehen&s;ion, as though God was not at all times equally pre&s;ent, in regard of his exi&s;t|ence, in all places what&s;oever; but to give us to under&s;tand that <HI>heaven</HI> is the place where he mo&s;t con&s;tantly and gloriou&s;ly makes it appear that he is pre&s;ent; and that the <HI>tabernacle</HI> of Mo&s;es, and the <HI>temple</HI> of Solomon, were for a while, and du|ring the plea&s;ure of God, the places from whence he &s;aw fit to make manife&s;t his pre&s;ence by com|munications of mercy or judgement. He was as truly pre&s;ent in all other places of the earth, as in this tabernacle and temple; though not to the &s;ame purpo&s;es of manife&s;tation. And he is now, and has all along been, as really pre&s;ent on earth, and in every part of it, as in heaven it&s;elf; though heaven is the place where he makes it apparent, in the highe&s;t and noble&s;t &s;en&s;e, that he is pre&s;ent: and he is accordingly &s;aid, after the manner of &s;peaking among men, to <HI>be</HI> there, to have <HI>his throne</HI> there, and to <HI>live and dwell</HI> there. The plain truth is, notwith&s;tanding the modes of &s;peech which have been mentioned, which, though figurative, and borrowed from comparatively low &s;imilitudes, are well adapted to human weakne&s;s; I &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e modes of &s;peak|ing, we mu&s;t conceive of God as ab&s;olutely un|confined in the extent of his exi&s;tence, as being at once pre&s;ent throughout the univer&s;e, and be|yond it, in all places, and in all &s;pace, without bounds and limits. And rea&s;on concurs with re|velation in leading us into this idea of God.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;&s;ured, from the regular exerci&s;e of our rea&s;onable powers, that the God we believe
<PB N="9" REF="018953_0007_0FA9064903F48ED8">
in, and wor&s;hip, is an infinitely perfect being; and if he is infinitely perfect, he mu&s;t be unlimited in the extent of his exi&s;tence. The&s;e ideas are in&s;epa|rably connected with each other. We find, by expe|rience, that we, who are the highe&s;t order of beings in this lower world, are confined in our exi&s;tence within a narrow &s;phere, not being able to be pre|&s;ent but in one place at the &s;ame time, and being equally unable to move from this place to that but within certain limits, and in certain periods of time: and from hence we certainly know, be|cau&s;e we feel it to be true, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s exi&s;t|ence in an imperfect degree only, as it is thus bounded in its extent: and from hence al&s;o we can readily perceive, that, by enlarging the extent of exi&s;tence in our imaginations, we &s;hall have an idea of it as &s;till more perfect; and by enlarging it to the utmo&s;t of our capacity, and then, &s;uppo|&s;ing it &s;till capable of enlargement beyond all bounds, we come as near as our intellectual pow|ers will permit, to exi&s;tence that is infinitely per|fect. And &s;uch exi&s;tence mu&s;t be attributed to God. He mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to fill heaven and earth, all worlds, all things, all place, all &s;pace with his boundle&s;s and unlimited pre&s;ence; or his ex|i&s;tence will be le&s;s perfect than it might be, that is, he will not be an ab&s;olutely perfect being, or, in other words, he will not be God. The argu|ing, from natural rea&s;on, is equally &s;trong in proof of all the perfections of God. As he is a &s;elf|exi&s;tent Being, without beginning to be, or deriv|ing what he is from any other, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to a&s;cribe to him one perfection as another, and every perfection without limitation in degree. There is therefore, upon the foot of rea&s;on, as
<PB N="10" REF="018953_0008_0FA90649EB5F93A0">
good grounds to think, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ab&s;olute|ly exten&s;ive exi&s;tence, as that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it at all. For what is there that &s;hould limit his exi&s;tence, confining it within the&s;e or tho&s;e bounds? We know of nothing, we can conceive of nothing; but are unavoidably led to think, from his having exi&s;tence at all, that he is not confined within any &s;uppo&s;able bounds, but is univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, filling all worlds, all things, and all &s;pace.</P>
<P>BUT the omnipre&s;ence of God is the doctrine of revelation, as well as of rea&s;on. The &s;acred books that contain the revelations of God, it is true, do not enter upon a philo&s;ophical con&s;ider|ation of any of the divine attributes; but treat of them principally in a way that is adapted to an&s;wer the ends of piety. And thus it &s;peaks of the "pre&s;ence" of God; not concerning it&s;elf &s;o much about its &s;trict philo&s;ophic notion, as to lead us into &s;uch &s;entiments with reference to its extent, as may be of mo&s;t u&s;e to the purpo&s;es of religion. And it &s;ufficiently gives us to under|&s;tand, that it is amazingly exten&s;ive, not being confined to heaven, but diffu&s;ing it&s;elf &s;o as to fill both heaven and earth. The language of the bible is emphatically &s;trong to this purpo&s;e. Says the prophet Jeremiah, per&s;onating the great God him&s;elf by commi&s;&s;ion from him, <HI>Do not I fill heaven, and earth?</HI> The in&s;pired David, in the 139th P&s;alm, very &s;trongly, as well as beautifully de&s;cribes the ble&s;&s;ed God, as "pre&s;ent every where, in heaven, in hell, in the uttermo&s;t parts of the &s;ea;" yea, as "po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our very reins." And the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, in making known the one true and living God, to the ido|latrous
<PB N="11" REF="018953_0009_0FA9064A8078D1B0">
people at Athens, de&s;cribes him to them, Acts xvii. 27, 28. <HI>Not as far from every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our being.</HI></P>
<P>IT may not be unworthy of notice here, that the omni&s;cience and omnipre&s;ence of God involve each other; at lea&s;t, they are &s;o nearly and clo&s;e|ly connected, that we cannot ea&s;ily, if at all, con|ceive of the one without the other. Perhaps, they are in&s;eparable It may be, God could not be omni&s;cient, if he was not omnipre&s;ent. Now, the &s;cripture is full and expre&s;s in declaring the omni&s;cience of God, which is a con&s;tructive proof of his omnipre&s;ence al&s;o. He is repre&s;ented as <HI>knowing all things,</HI> whether pa&s;t, pre&s;ent or to come. He is &s;aid to be well acquainted with even <HI>the hearts of all the children of men,</HI> the devi|ces, imaginations, purpo&s;es, and mo&s;t &s;ecret work|ing; yea, we are a&s;&s;ured, that "<HI>nothing is hid from his all&s;eeing eye,</HI>" and that he has a mo&s;t clear, perfect, and certain knowledge of all things, not excepting the volitions, and determinations, of free intelligent agents, however, they may be &s;ecreted from all other beings whatever. The in&s;pired David, with equal propriety and ele|gance, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf upon this matter, in the 139th P&s;alm, <HI>O Lord, thou ha&s;t &s;earched me, and known me, thou knowe&s;t my down &s;itting, and mine up ri&s;ing, thou under&s;tande&s;t my thoughts afar off. Thou compa&s;&s;e&s;t my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo! O Lord, thou knowe&s;t it altogether. Thou ha&s;t be&s;et me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</HI> It is obvious to per|ceive, that, in the&s;e words of the holy prophet,
<PB N="12" REF="018953_0010_0FA9064E1C320098">
there is a connection between the knowledge and pre&s;ence of God. This is ob&s;ervably con&s;picuous in the 3d ver&s;e, <HI>Thou compa&s;&s;e&s;t my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</HI> And it &s;hould &s;eem as though he had it in direct view to ground the omni&s;cience of God, of which he had been &s;peaking, upon his omnipre&s;ence, for he goes on, in the following ver&s;e to tell us, there was no <HI>going from his pre&s;ence</HI>; for he exi&s;t|ed in heaven, in hell, on earth, and even in the hearts of men. A mo&s;t marvellous truth this; but yet, a mo&s;t certain one, as we have &s;een both from rea&s;on and revelation.</P>
<P>I NOW proceed to what I had principally in view in the choice of this &s;ubject, to make the proper reflections which are deducible from it. And,</P>
<P N="1">I. IF God is pre&s;ent every where, then he is equally the object of adoration and wor&s;hip in all parts of the earth, and may rea&s;onably be prayed to in this, or that, or the other place, ei|ther on the &s;ea, or the dry land. For, being omnipre&s;ent, we can be in no place where his ear will not be open to our cry: and he can as well hear, and an&s;wer our reque&s;ts in one place as another.</P>
<P>IT is true, &s;hould God be plea&s;ed to &s;pecify any one place in di&s;tinction from another, as the place where he would be applied to, and from whence he would make the manife&s;tations of his pre&s;ence in the be&s;towment of favours; it would now be fit and rea&s;onable he &s;hould be wor&s;hiped in this place in preference to, and di&s;tinction from, every
<PB N="13" REF="018953_0011_0FA9064F0ACF8C30">
other. And thus it was, re&s;pecting the Jews of old. The tabernacle, in the days of Mo&s;es, and for &s;everal ages, was the &s;pecial place, where God had declared he would be pre&s;ent to the purpo&s;es of manife&s;ting him&s;elf in ble&s;&s;ings to his people. In this place therefore, rather than any other, and in di&s;tinction from every other, it was their duty, as a nation, to pay their religious homage to him. The Divine pre&s;ence, as to its mani|fe&s;tation, was removed, in the days of Solomon from the tabernacle to the temple at Jeru&s;alem. This became now the habitation of God, the place from whence he commanded the ble&s;&s;ing: and to this place it was that the tribes of I&s;rael were obliged to come, from all parts of Canaan, to offer &s;acrifice, and pay religious honour to the Deity. But the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t makes no dif|ference between one place and another. The time has long &s;ince come, when the command to wor&s;hip him at Jeru&s;alem, or in any one place in di&s;tinction from another, is no more in force; but we may pay homage to our Maker in any place whatever. It is of no importance where this is done: only, we mu&s;t "wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit, and in truth." Men may, under the influence of &s;uper&s;tition, or to &s;erve their worldly ends, con&s;ecrate certain &s;pots of ground, and the buildings erected on them; calling them holy, as being, after their con&s;ecration, the habi|tations of God, the places where he is more pe|culiarly pre&s;ent than in other places: but it ought to be &s;eriou&s;ly realized, that no prie&s;t, bi&s;hop, pope, or any power on earth, can confine the pre&s;ence of the immen&s;e Being, as to any re|ligious purpo&s;e, to any hou&s;e built with hands;
<PB N="14" REF="018953_0012_0FA9064FDA2EE568">
nor are there any offices of divine wor&s;hip, but may be as truly acceptable to God in any place, as in the be&s;t con&s;ecrated temple, provided they are performed "with clean hands and a pure heart."</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, we read, in the &s;acred books, that our Saviour &s;ometimes preached from the &s;ide of a fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;el, to tho&s;e who &s;tood on the &s;hore; &s;ometimes from the declining part of a mountain; &s;ometimes in the wilderne&s;s; &s;ometimes in a pri|vate hou&s;e; and &s;ometimes in the open field: and he much oftener carried on the wor&s;hip of God, with his di&s;ciples and followers, in &s;uch places as the&s;e, than in the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogues, or even the temple it&s;elf; which &s;urely he never would have done, if his go&s;pel had not taken away all di&s;tinction between one place and another; in&s;omuch, that where ever any meet together in his name, and to wor&s;hip the father through his mediation, they may be &s;ure of being accepted, if they <HI>lift up holy hands with a pure heart.</HI></P>
<P>NOT but that it is highly fit hou&s;es &s;hould be erected for public wor&s;hip; for wor&s;hipping God, in a public manner, is both a <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> duty; and being &s;o, hou&s;es mu&s;t be built for this purpo&s;e; otherwi&s;e people could not come to|gether, at &s;tated times, to join as one in paying homage to their Maker.</P>
<P>IT was under the influence of the&s;e &s;entiments, that the fathers of this church, in ancient times, built the fir&s;t church for public wor&s;hip in this town. It &s;tood at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;outh|ea&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="018953_0013_0FA90650C396C708">
corner of the pre&s;ent State Hou&s;e. Here they met for public wor&s;hip about nine or ten years. A larger and more commodious hou&s;e was then built in the place where we now wor&s;hip. The fir&s;t &s;ermon preached in it was on Augu&s;t the 23d, 1640. If we reckon from this date, that hou&s;e was made u&s;e of for the public &s;ervices of religion <HI>&s;eventy one years,</HI> when it was reduced to a&s;hes by the mo&s;t exten&s;ively de&s;olating fire that was ever known in Bo&s;ton. By the be&s;t accounts I have been able to get, about one <HI>hundred and ten families</HI> were forced out of their dwelling places, &s;ome of which &s;uffered much in their worldly intere&s;t, others were deprived of all they had. A number of per&s;ons al&s;o lo&s;t their lives, either by blowing up of hou&s;es, or by venturing too far to quench the flames, or re&s;cue endangered goods from de&s;tructi|on. Awfully di&s;tre&s;&s;ing indeed was this night, as al&s;o was the face of our de&s;olate places the next day. I was my&s;elf, when a little boy, a &s;pectator of the devouring flames, and the de&s;o|lation occa&s;ioned by them. God grant we may never &s;ee again &s;uch an awful fire. It was not judged convenient to rebuild with wood; and the winter coming on, when brick work could not be well engaged in, it was defered till the &s;pring, to which it was owing that <HI>about one year and &s;e|ven months</HI> were completed before we could meet together in an hou&s;e of our own to wor&s;hip our maker. The fir&s;t &s;ermon preached in this then new hou&s;e was on May the 3d. 1713. Through the kind providence of him who is <HI>head over all for the good of the church,</HI> no bad accidents, no evil occurrences, have wholly hindered our wor&s;hip|ping God in this hou&s;e, till, by the decays <HI>naturally</HI>

ari&s;ing from a cour&s;e of years, it became nece&s;&s;a|ry it &s;hould be repaired. This has been done, thanks be to God, with remarkable harmony among your&s;elves, and &s;afety to tho&s;e who have been your workmen. Permit me to rejoice with you on this account, as al&s;o, that, while your hou&s;e was repairing, brotherly love &s;o plea&s;ingly and con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between you, and the Si&s;|ter Church with whom you united in your atten|dance on go&s;pel in&s;titutions, and that we parted, not with divided hearts, but in the exerci&s;e of that mutual love which becometh the di&s;ciples of Je|&s;us.</P>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you, my brethren in Chri&s;t, not in a way of ceremonial compliment, but with that &s;incerity which is always proper, when a Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ter is &s;peaking from the &s;acred de&s;k; I congratulate you upon your having repaired this hou&s;e, adapting it with decency and convenience to the purpo&s;e of your meeting together to pay homage to the &s;upreme Governour of the world. I doubt not you entered into <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>courts</HI> this morning with prai&s;e, making your &s;upplications to the father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;ome &s;uch language as that of the 24th P&s;alm, uttered upon the Ark's being fixed in the temple of old, built by the &s;pecial direction of heaven, <HI>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be lifted up ye everla&s;ting doors, that the King of glory may come in.</HI> You will not imagine, that the God of glory will come down to dwell in this hou&s;e, as he dwelt in the tabernacle built by Mo&s;es, or in the temple built afterwards by Solomon: But he may, and will, if it be not your own fault, dwell in it in a far higher and

better manner, in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e; that is, to the purpo&s;es of &s;uch graces as &s;hall prepare you for admi&s;&s;ion into his temple, in the Jeru&s;alem that is above, where you &s;hall give glory to God, and the Lamb in all perfection, and &s;o as that you &s;hall be uninterruptably happy forever.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e you have repaired, and in which you begin this morning to pay homage to the De|ity, is, as to external appearance, more convenient and beautiful, than in its former &s;tate.

The fir&s;t hou&s;e, I have rea&s;on to believe, had often the glory of the grace of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, manife&s;ted in it, by the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and edification of &s;aints in faith, comfort and holine&s;s, until they were crowned with eternal life. May this glory of the Lord be more univer&s;ally and con&s;picuou&s;ly di&s;|played in this latter hou&s;e, under the mini&s;trations of your pre&s;ent pa&s;tors, and all &s;ucceeding ones, that it may be &s;aid of multitudes that they were born here, in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, that they were nurtured here, and carried on from babes in Chri&s;t, until they attained to the &s;tature of men, and were formed to a metene&s;s for heavenly glory.</P>
<P>NEARLY &s;ixty years, are now compleated, my beloved brethren, &s;ince I have been with you in the &s;ervice of the Go&s;pel; and my labours, I tru&s;t; have not been wholly in vain, notwith&s;tanding my manifold infirmities and imperfections. Need I an epi&s;tle of commendation from you? Ye are your&s;elves, &s;ome of you, I have abundant rea&s;on to believe, my epi&s;tle, yea rather the epi&s;tle
<PB N="18" REF="018953_0016_0FA9065587A882A0">
of Chri&s;t, through a divine influence, accompany|ing my mini&s;trations, however unworthy, written not with ink, but with the &s;pirit of the living God; not in tables of &s;tone, but in fle&s;hy tables of the heart. Such tru&s;t have I through Chri&s;t, God-ward. And it is my joy now, and may it be my crown of rejoicing in the pre&s;ence of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming!</P>
<P>I AM now grown old, and unable, through ma|nifold infirmities, to go on with the work of the &s;acred mini&s;try. Thanks be to God you have my &s;on in the go&s;pel to &s;upply my place, and he will do it much to your advantage, as he is now in the prime of life, and &s;ingularly qualified to &s;erve the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t among you. I am decrea&s;|ed, and &s;hall decrea&s;e &s;till more and more, but he will increa&s;e: God grant it may be in all &s;piritual wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, that he may be more and more furni&s;hed for a ma&s;ter-workman in the kingdom of Chri&s;t. God Almighty ble&s;s him, and make him, and long continue him, a rich ble&s;|&s;ing to you and yours; and may he be improved by heaven, as an in&s;trument of turning many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he may &s;hine as a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude, in the firmament of heaven, forever and ever.</P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude with a few words of ad|vice, which you may look upon as the la&s;t and dying words of your aged pa&s;tor from this de&s;k, as he does not expect to be much longer with you; and my beloved &s;on in Chri&s;t, will I doubt not, join with me in recommending them to you.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="018953_0017_0FA9065666EF50D0">IN the fir&s;t place: As that day, which, from the Apo&s;tle John, and in his &s;tile, we call the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>day,</HI> is eminently <HI>the day</HI> on which it is your duty to appear in the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e, be advi&s;ed to make it your delight to rejoice at its approach, and not to &s;uffer it to be a wea|rine&s;s to you. Be glad at every return of this appointed &s;ea&s;on to glorify God in the hou&s;e of his glory. This was the temper of holy David, and mu&s;t, in a good degree, be your's, or you will not carry in your brea&s;ts, one of the &s;tronge&s;t proofs, that you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that real piety, without which you cannot, upon a &s;olid foundati|on, hope for the &s;alvation of God. Di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elves from tho&s;e multitudes, in this degena|rate age, who are made unea&s;y upon &s;eeing the light of this day of God, and feel impatient until it is pa&s;&s;ed and gone; and &s;et before their view &s;uch an example of pious regard to the Lord's day, as may happily tend to excite in them a care of imitation.</P>
<P>BE advi&s;ed al&s;o to be &s;teady and con&s;tant in waiting upon God in <HI>the place where his honour dwells.</HI> It is amazing conde&s;cention in the Ma|je&s;ty of heaven, that he will permit &s;uch worms of the du&s;t as we are, to appear in any hou&s;e we may build to meet in to wor&s;hip him. He hum|bles him&s;elf to take notice of the adoration of angels: and yet he readily bows the heavens, and comes down, that he may fill his hou&s;es for wor&s;hip with his glory. Will you not then re|joice at opportunities of appearing in this hou&s;e, where you may hope he will manife&s;t his glory? You cannot, in any way, do greater honour to
<PB N="20" REF="018953_0018_0FA9065684E14C50">
your&s;elves, or put your&s;elves under greater ad|vantages in order to your obtaining the ble&s;&s;ing, even live forever more. Do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be needle&s;sly ab&s;ent from the hou&s;e of God, but attend there in a &s;teady, uniform cour&s;e, on the in&s;titutions of divine wor&s;hip. Content not your&s;elves with joining in prayer, and in hearing the preached word; but pay all due honour to the ordinance of the &s;upper. In obedience to the command of God's King in Zion, neglect not to eat bread, and drink wine, in remembrance of him who died for your &s;ins, that, by making atonement for them, he might open a way for the di&s;play of God's mercy in their pardon. Breaking bread at the table of Chri&s;t, is a plain, expre&s;s part of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, and as proper and &s;uitable an one as any that has been appointed to be attended on in his hou&s;e, and as nece&s;&s;ary an one, in point of obligation, to be regarded by all who call them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. Let tho&s;e among you who have hitherto been un|mindful of their duty, in this &s;pecial in&s;tance, be humbled in a &s;en&s;e of their pa&s;t neglect, and at length be per&s;uaded to come into the &s;teady con|tinued practice of it, that the attendants at the go&s;pel &s;upper may be numerous, more &s;o in the latter hou&s;e than in the former.</P>
<P>BE advi&s;ed again to come &s;ea&s;onably to this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, from &s;abbath to &s;abbath, &s;o as that no part of the publick devotion of the &s;anc|tuary may be carried on without your joining in it. You are &s;o &s;ituated, in common with the other chri&s;tian &s;ocieties in this town, that you may, with ca&s;e, if it be not your own fault,
<PB N="21" REF="018953_0019_0FA90657466D2828">
a&s;&s;emble together &s;o nearly at the &s;ame time, as that you may all unite as one in every exerci&s;e of publick piety towards God. And it is pity, that any, through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or any wor&s;e cau&s;e, &s;hould come &s;o late to God's hou&s;e, as to lo&s;e the opportunity of bearing their part in beginning the wor&s;hip of God, whether by prayer, reading his holy word, or &s;inging to his prai&s;e. Too common a fault this, in all our churches, and it were to be wi&s;hed it might be generally amended.</P>
<P>BE advi&s;ed yet further to take all due care, that the &s;ervices of God's hou&s;e be performed in a becoming manner. In order whereto, your out|ward behaviour &s;hould be grave, &s;erious, and not, in any mea&s;ure, expre&s;&s;ive of levity, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and indifferency, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e exerci&s;es of piety, you meet together to unite in. I am not going to point out to you any particular ge&s;tures of body, whether kneeling, or &s;tanding, or &s;itting, as mo&s;t decent; nor to &s;peak of any one ge&s;ture as &s;uited to one part of wor&s;hip, and another as better to another. I &s;hall leave this to tho&s;e who are fond of ceremonial nicety, and imagine God is &s;o too. All I aim at &s;aying is only this in general, that you &s;hould maintain a care of appearing outward|ly decent and reverent in the time of wor&s;hip; re&s;training your&s;elves from any thing, either in look, ge&s;ture, or behaviour that is light, or vain, or in any re&s;pect unbecoming the pre&s;ence you are in, or the &s;olemn duties you are to perform.</P>
<P>BUT it is not enough that you behave in God's hou&s;e with external decency; but there mu&s;t be al&s;o the inward reverence of your hearts, in all the
<PB N="22" REF="018953_0020_0FA906580C83ACA0">
acts of divine wor&s;hip you engage in. Remem|ber, there may be the former where there is not the latter. Your deportment in the hou&s;e of the Lord may be vi&s;ibly &s;erious and devout, while yet your thoughts may he vainly wandering to the ends of the earth. You may come, and &s;it before God in his hou&s;e, and all the while your hearts may be going after coveteou&s;ne&s;s, pride, &s;en&s;uality, or &s;ome lu&s;t or other. It is not there|fore enough, that you are externally decent in the time of wor&s;hip, but you &s;hould revere and honour the God you adore, in your hearts; bearing it in mind, that he is a &s;pirit, and will be plea&s;ed with no wor&s;hip but that which is performed in &s;pirit, and in truth. Whenever, therefore, you come to God's hou&s;e to attend on the in&s;titutions of piety, look well to your inward frame of mind, and be above all things careful, that you yield to God the love of your hearts, and &s;erve him with true go&s;pel &s;incerity. For God looketh not at the out|ward appearance, but the heart; and will not therefore e&s;teem him&s;elf <HI>&s;anctified by tho&s;e who come nigh him,</HI> unle&s;s they &s;erve him with reverence and godly fear. The upright in their wor&s;hip are tho&s;e only his <HI>countenance will behold with delight.</HI></P>
<P>FINALLY, be advi&s;ed to exhibit and maintain a con&s;i&s;tent character; not imagining that your <HI>whole duty</HI> lies in <HI>&s;anctuary devotion,</HI> or that this will atone for the &s;ins of your lives. It is a &s;ure truth, and you &s;hould impre&s;s it on your minds as &s;uch, that you will only trifle with God in the &s;ervices of his hou&s;e, if, when you go from it, you behave as <HI>men of the world, who&s;e only portion is here.</HI> The whole tenor of your conver&s;ation &s;hould corre&s;pond
<PB N="23" REF="018953_0021_0FA90658C93F7650" MS="y">
to the &s;acred exerci&s;es of <HI>the place where his honour dwells.</HI> You &s;hould make it appear to all you conver&s;e with, that the love of God reigns in your hearts. And from love to him, and a principle of unfeigned faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a vein of true chri&s;|tian piety and goodne&s;s &s;hould run through your whole conduct in life. Holine&s;s to the Lord &s;hould be in&s;cribed on all your employments and enjoyments. Whether you eat or drink, whether you buy or &s;ell, or whatever you do, you &s;hould do all to the glory of God, and in the name of Chri&s;t: &s;o may you hope, and upon ju&s;t and &s;olid grounds, that your &s;acrifices of prayer and prai&s;e, and all your acts of devotion, whether they are offered to God from your clo&s;et, families, or his hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, will be acceptable to him; and that, from wor&s;hipping and &s;erving him here on earth, you &s;hall, in proper &s;ea&s;on, have entrance granted to you into the temple of God above, where you &s;hall join, with that innumerable company which have been &s;elected from the re&s;t of mankind, in all ages, in &s;inging&mdash; HALLALUJAHS, TO HIM THAT SITTETH ON THE THRONE, AND TO THE LAMB, FOR EVER AND EVER. AMEN.</P>
