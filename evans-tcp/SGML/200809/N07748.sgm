<HEAD>A LETTER from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Augu&s;t 22, 1764, taken from the <HI>London Chronicle</HI> No. 1223.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Indian War &s;till greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;es our Frontier Counties, great Numbers are driven from their Habitations, and Want and Poverty force many to live on their Plantations, tho' they never go to Bed without Danger of being cut off by the Savages before the Morning. This was the Fate of &s;ome Families lately, who were our Neighbours and intimate Friends &s;ome Years ago, while they lived in the interior Counties. They murdered a Woman with Child, cut the Infant out of her Womb, and made her and it mo&s;t horrid Spectales of their Cruelty. They al&s;o, not many Weeks ago, &s;tole down thro' the Inhabitants and ma&s;&s;acred a Schoolma&s;ter and his Scholars in a mo&s;t barbarous Manner. The&s;e Murders are generally committed by Indians who lived either near or among the Europeans in the Time of Peace; they know the State of the Frontiers, and how to di&s;tre&s;s them, and &s;teal off without Di&s;covery. The&s;e Indians are the Remains of a Part of the Indian Nation from whom we bought our Lands. They are a free independent People; they are no Subjects of England, as &s;ome believe, nor did they ever give up their National Independency; they have been in Alliance with England, but &s;till have all the Powers of a free Nation, and make War and Peace with us, as with others, as they plea&s;e. The Quakers are chiefly in our three interior Counties, as they were the fir&s;t Settlers; and the five Frontier Counties are &s;ettled in general with People of other Denominations, chiefly Luthe|rans, and Dutch and Engli&s;h Presbyterians, with a Mixture of Bapti&s;ts and the Church of England. In all our Troubles the Quakers, at lea&s;t a Quaker Faction, have &s;ecretly &s;upported the Indians, held Treaties and Corre&s;pondence with them in our Wars, and be&s;towed on them Arms and Ammunition, and Tomahawks, even when they were murdering our Frontier Inhabitants. When a Peace was con|cluded, if we may u&s;e an Indian Idiom, they wiped away the Blood &s;hed by the Indians without obliging them to return our Captives. We put 500 l. into the Hands of our Governor, who entru&s;ted it to our Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners, to redeem our Captives &s;o &s;hamefully de&s;erted; but we did not receive above a Score, if &s;o many, notwith|&s;tanding our utmo&s;t Endeavours. The very Indians who lived among us, and had done us great Mi&s;chiefs, during the War, &s;at in the Council with the Nations to whom they belonged, and concluded this Peace: And even in Time of Peace, before this War broke out, they told the Inhabitants among whom they lived, that they had
<PB N="ii" REF="009892_0004_0F7AD578A9EEAE20">
&s;calped and carried them into Captivity, and would do it again. The War broke out, and in a few Days above 750 Families were driven from their peaceable Habitations, were forced to adandon their Cattle, Crops, and Hou&s;hold Furniture, nay many were glad to e&s;cape with|out bringing Bed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ths and wearing Apparel with them, and they lived in Wig-wams like the Indians, hardly &s;heltered from the In|clemency of the Weather. When ready to peri&s;h for want of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, our Society &s;ent them 150 l. as we wrote you Word; and &s;oon after Collections were made by every Religious Society in this City (the Quakers only excepted) tho' they were earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to contribute to their Relief: Even the Roman Catholics, una&s;ked, generou&s;ly made a Collection for their Relief. You de&s;ired to know the Rea&s;on why the Quakers were &s;o backward, I really can give none that they have a&s;&s;igned, &s;ave this, that they knew other Societies would relieve them, and they would afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;t, if there was occa&s;ion; but had all taken this cold Method, many of them mu&s;t have peri&s;hed; and tho' their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es are &s;till great, and tho' it is acknowledged even in our A&s;&s;embly, that 100,000 l. would not pay their Lo&s;&s;es, yet they would do Nothing then, nor now, to help them: Yet, during the la&s;t War, they expended 5000 l. in Pre&s;ents to the Indians, while they were drenching our Frontier Settlements in the Blood of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants. We know no Rea&s;on for this Conduct, but an envious Temper, becau&s;e the Frontier Counties, who are of different Denominations, mu&s;t &s;hare the Power with them, that they now abu&s;e; and to prevent this, they have, in forming the new Counties, ordered it &s;o, that but ten Repre&s;entatives are &s;ent from five Frontier Counties, and twenty-&s;ix are &s;ent from the three Interior Counties, under the Quakers Influence. The&s;e Frontier Inhabitants complain that they are not fairly repre&s;ented, or el&s;e they had not been &s;uch Sufferers; and as the Charter allows every County at lea&s;t four to repre&s;ent them, they de&s;ire this Charter Privilege; and this occa&s;ions, as far as I can judge, all our Quakers Uncharitablene&s;s. No Men were ever fonder of Power. The Frontier Inhabitants expo&s;ed to daily Incur&s;ions of the Indians, formed a Party of Volunteers to go and de&s;troy &s;ome Indian Town, near our Borders, on Su&s;quehanna; accordingly 116 Men marched almo&s;t to their Towns, and were informed that 50 of tho&s;e Indians, again&s;t whom they had &s;et out, were on their March again&s;t the Frontiers. They returned and overtook the Indians, and routed them at the Mun&s;ey Hill on Su&s;quehanna. They then propo&s;ed to follow their Blow, and applied to Colonel Arm&s;trong, who commanded the Provincial Forces. Two Hundred Volunteers went out with him, and 150 Provincials; but the Indians among us gave Notice to our Enemies, and they e&s;caped; but our People de&s;troyed about 300 Acres of Corn, and burnt their Dwellings, and returned enraged to find that an Indian Town of about twenty or thirty Per&s;ons had now informed their Friends, again&s;t whom our Men had marched, and
<PB N="iii" REF="009892_0005_0F7AD5790FE1DF48">
who were perfidiou&s;ly playing the &s;ame Pranks as they did la&s;t War; they marched to their Town and cut off &s;ome of them, others fled to a Borough named Lanca&s;ter, and there they came and cut them off. This the Quakers have painted as a Ma&s;&s;acre and a mo&s;t horrid Murder, tho' it was no more but what our People &s;uffered on all Occa&s;ions. After their Corn was de&s;troyed, and that trouble&s;ome Ne&s;t were obliged to remove, a Party of Indians among the Inhabitants that carried the Ene|mies Arms and Ammunition, and had conducted them into the Settle|ment, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in murdering the Inhabitants, applied to the Quakers, and they found Means to bring them down to Philadelphia, and have maintained them at the Expence of the Province. Afterwards &s;ome of the very Indians that were beat at the Mun&s;ey Hill, and that had their Corn de&s;troyed, &s;ued for the &s;ame Privileges, and were brought to Philadelphia, and maintained by the Province. This inflamed the Re&s;entment of a Number of the Inhabitants on the Frontiers, and about 500 came down well armed, without forming them&s;elves into Companies, determined to cut off the&s;e Enemies. The Indians were then under the Governor's Protection, and at the Reque&s;t of the Quaker Faction were guarded by a Company of the King's Forces. The&s;e In&s;urgents declared they were Loyal Subjects, and had fought the King's Battles &s;ince Braddock's Defeat, and would not do what looked like Rebellion, tho' they thought it exceeding hard that they &s;hould be obliged to pay Taxes to maintain their Enemies. They complained of Grievances and Sufferings that would have drawn Tears from Stones; the Mayor of our City, two leading Members of the A&s;&s;embly, and the King's Attorney-General, and about ten Mini&s;ters and Gentlemen, were at the Conference, and they were &s;olemnly promi&s;ed a Redre&s;s of Grievances, if they appointed two of their Number to lay them before the Governor and A&s;&s;embly, and returned in Peace to their Dwellings: This they did; and marched Abroad and Home with Decency above 100 Miles, paying every One for what they had on their Journey. But they are &s;till without Redre&s;s of their Grievances. This has inflamed the Quaker Faction, who are fooli&s;hly attached to the Indians, and is made a Plea for with-holding their Charity. We have been able to do Nothing to &s;pread the Go&s;pel either among the Indians or the Europeans &s;ince the War broke out: We have a&s;&s;i&s;ted and are deter|mined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Inhabitants; and we rejoice that thro' your Liberality, a kind Providence has enabled us at any Time, when their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es grow very great, to give them Relief.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN ADDRESS TO THE</HI> Rev. Dr. <HI>Ali&s;on,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Ewing,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the London Chronicle, No. 1223, is a very extra|ordinary Letter, dated at <HI>Philadelphia, Augu&s;t</HI> 22, 1764, which, tho' not &s;ign'd with your Names, carries evident Marks of your being the Authors. I confe&s;s it gave me real Concern to find that Men of your holy Function, could cooly and deliberately publi&s;h to the World &s;o many defamatory Untruths, as that Letter contains, again&s;t a Society of People, who&s;e Merit and virtuous Demeanor, ever &s;ince the Settlement of the Colony, had gain'd them the Confidence and E&s;teem or the Publick. You have therein endeavoured to make the prudent Policy of the Government appear criminal, by wickedly mi&s;repre&s;enting its Tran&s;actions; and, having done this, you impute the imaginary Crimes to the <HI>Quakers</HI> with the uncharitable De&s;ign of rendering their Conduct obnoxious to their Sovereign and odious to Mankind.</P>
<P>WITH this View it is, you alledge,
<Q>That the Qua|kers have <HI>&s;ecretly</HI> &s;upported the Indians, held Treaties and Corre&s;pondence with them, in our Wars, and be|&s;towed on them <HI>Arms and Ammunition and Tomhawks,</HI> even when they were murdering our Frontier Inhabitants.</Q>
I am at a Lo&s;s what Words to u&s;e in remarking on this Charge. I am not fond of u&s;ing har&s;h Ones, and yet when the Manner of making it, and the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="2" REF="009892_0007_0F7AD57A479FDBC8">
the Accu&s;ation is con&s;idered, every hone&s;t Mind mu&s;t determine none can be found too &s;evere. The Charge is general, and in the Affirmative, and therefore by the Policy and Rea&s;on of all Laws ought to be proved before it is credited; otherwi&s;e the mo&s;t abandoned Wretch, may at any Time take the Life, and ruin the Reputation, of the mo&s;t innocent and virtuous on his bare A&s;&s;ertion. And indeed, a great Writer ob&s;erves, that a general Charge in a Libel ought not to be credited, tho' it was &s;upported by the Oath of the Libeller. The Laws of the Land are made to puni&s;h Offenders, and no one ought to be publickly di&s;graced before he has had an Opportunity of vindicating his Innocence. The Crime you accu&s;e this People with is <HI>High Trea&s;on.</HI> The Courts of Ju&s;tice have ever been open to receive your Informations again&s;t them, and the Government ready to inflict the Puni&s;hment on Men that de&s;erve it. Had you then the lea&s;t Proof of the Facts, What Rea&s;on can be given, why the &s;ame Malice and Ill-will have not prompted you to bring them to Ju&s;tice, which induced you thus publickly to defame them in your Letter? Your Duty to the Community, and your Loyalty to your Sovereign, &s;hould have incited you to the Fir&s;t: The Rules of Morality and the Precepts of the Religion you profe&s;s and publickly teach, &s;hould have deter'd you from the other. How then &s;hall we account for this Breach of the Duties of Morality and Religion? Why did you not make this Charge before &s;ome proper Judicatory, in&s;tead of publi&s;hing it in a Libel? It mu&s;t be becau&s;e you were con&s;cious it &s;prung from the wicked Invention of your own Brains, and therefore impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;upported.</P>
<P>BUT permit me to a&s;k you, <HI>when, where,</HI> and <HI>how</HI> was this heinous Offence again&s;t your Sovereign and the Government committed by the Quakers? If you cannot tell the <HI>Time, Place,</HI> or the <HI>Manner,</HI> were you, or ten Thou&s;and like you, to make the Charge even upon Oath, you mu&s;t not expect to be credited&mdash;And if you can give
<PB N="3" REF="009892_0008_0F7AD57C4C711AB8">
&s;uch Information, how dare you conceal an Offence of High Trea&s;on from the Goverment? Is your Loyalty &s;o faint, and your Virtue &s;o low, as not to be powerful enough to prevail on you to di&s;charge your Duty to your King and your Country?</P>
<P>AFTER making this Charge again&s;t the Quakers in general, you de&s;cend to &s;ay, "at lea&s;t a Quaker Faction" have done this. Pray inform us how many compo&s;e this Faction? If they are numerous, it affords you a better Opportunity of fixing it on &s;ome of them, and of bringing them to Ju&s;tice. If a few, how ba&s;e and wicked is it in you, Reverend Sirs, to endeavour from the Crimes of a few Individuals, &s;uppo&s;ing your Accu&s;ation to be ju&s;t, to calumniate the Reputation of a whole Society? Fifty Seven Pre&s;byterian Ruffians attacked the Indians, the antient <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Allies</HI> of the Engli&s;h, who had been long <HI>peaceably</HI> &s;ettled at <HI>Cone&s;togo,</HI> a Place far within the inhabited Parts, and barbarou&s;ly murdered in cool Blood, di&s;armed Men, helple&s;s Women, and innocent Infants, when on their bended Knees prote&s;ting their Innocence, and with uplifted Hands imploring their Lives. Now, would you think it ju&s;t in the Quakers to impute the&s;e horrid Deeds to your whole Society, and publi&s;h them to the World in the London Chronicle? I am &s;ure you would not.&mdash;But why then, Reverend Sirs, have you &s;o widely deviated from that golden Rule, <HI>Do unto others as you would they &s;hould do unto you?</HI> Think of this Que&s;tion&mdash;Think &s;eriou&s;ly of it on your Pillows&mdash; think of it in your Pulpit and when at Prayers; and, if no Remor&s;e or Penitence is the Effect of your Reflections, your Hearts mu&s;t be harder than the <HI>Nether Mill-&s;tone.</HI> For it is written,
<Q>Who &s;o privily &s;landereth his Neighbour, him will I de&s;troy." And, "with what Judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged.</Q></P>
<P>I DO not mean to deny, that there are &s;ome weak and wicked Men, among the Quakers. There are, and ever will be &s;uch among all Societies. Was not this a Truth, the

<P>The Presbyterians here, upon mature Deliberation, are of Opinion, that it is not <HI>&s;afe</HI> to do Things of &s;uch Importance ra&s;hly; our Privi|leges by the&s;e Means may be greatly <HI>abridged,</HI> but will never be <HI>enlarged.</HI></P>
<P>We are under the King's Protection and Government now as much as we can be for he will never govern us in Per&s;on; and it is of no great <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> whether his Deputy be recommended by the Pro|prietaries, or by &s;ome other great Man by his Maje&s;ty's Approbation.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Charter</HI> is in <HI>Danger</HI> by &s;uch a <HI>Change,</HI> and let no Man per|&s;uade you to the <HI>contrary.</HI> There has been a half-yearly Meeting of the Quakers in this City, but this Change of Government has not been propo&s;ed in their Meeting, as we can yet under&s;tand, <HI>nor is it approved of by the Heads of that Scociety.</HI> [A gro&s;s Fal&s;ehood!]</P>
<P>This Affair is in all Probability, a <HI>Trap</HI> laid to en&s;nare the unwary, and then to ca&s;t an Odium on the Presbyterians for ruining or attempt|ing to ruin the Province. The Frontier Counties are now &s;uing for a Redre&s;s of Grievances, and we have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to believe, that it is no more than an artful Scheme to <HI>divide</HI> or <HI>divert</HI> the Attention of the injur'd Frontier Inhabitants from pro&s;ecuting their Petitions, which very much alarm them. [<HI>Another Fal&s;ehood, for they had no Rea&s;on to believe any Thing of the Kind</HI>] For the&s;e Rea&s;ons we would earne&s;tly recommend it to you, to lo&s;e no Time in advi&s;ing all under your Influence, whether of <HI>our</HI> Denomination or <HI>others,</HI> from <HI>&s;igning any &s;uch Petition.</HI></P>

</LETTER></NOTE>) would never have had the lea&s;t Pretence to repre&s;ent this Society as di&s;loyal to the Crown, and again&s;t contributing to the Defence of the Province. It was the Folly and Ra&s;hne&s;s of <HI>one Man,</HI> that furni&s;hed them with the Means of giving their Mi&s;|repre&s;entations of the Conduct of the A&s;&s;embly an Appear|ance of Truth, at a Time when the Hou&s;e had given the mo&s;t evident Proof of their Obedience to the Royal Orders.
<PB N="5" REF="009892_0010_0F7AD57DB6ED5B08">
And it is this officious, mi&s;cheivous and ambitious Man, again&s;t whom alone you have heretofore made the Charges, which you now impute to the Society,
<Q>of holding Treaties and Corre&s;pondence with the Indians, and be&s;towing on them Tomhawks in Time of War,</Q>
&mdash;with how much Ju&s;tice and Truth, you and he alone can deter|mine. The Dexterity and Succe&s;s with which you and your Party have u&s;ed the Follies of this Man, to abu&s;e and di&s;credit the Society he unhappily belongs to, are now fatally notorious. The Ta&s;k of reciting all the Mi&s;|chiefs which he has brought on the Society, the Di&s;grace he has, and is continually &s;ubjecting them to, his wild Schemes to promote his own Importance, the Numbers his ab&s;urd Conduct has driven from the Society, and the other Effects of his fickle, yet head&s;trong impetuous Temper, would take up more Time than I can at pre&s;ent &s;pare: I &s;hall therefore only add, that Confu&s;ion and Di&s;credit have con&s;tantly attended the Affairs of tho&s;e who have had any Connections with him; and that it would have been happy for the Society, and the Liberties of Penn&s;ylvania, if they had never had any Fellow&s;hip with a Per&s;on of his Di&s;po&s;ition: For your Malevolence will never want a plau&s;ible Pretext for Mi&s;repre&s;entation and Slander again&s;t the <HI>whole Society,</HI> while he continues a Member, and your Con&s;ciences will permit you to aggra|vate the Follies of an <HI>Individual</HI> into heinous Crimes, and to impute them to the Society in general, who either never thought of them or gave them Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now leave this high Charge again&s;t the Quakers, which, without one probable Circum&s;tance attending it, re&s;ted &s;olely on your meer A&s;&s;ertion. And how much Credit ought to be given to that, I &s;hall make evident before I conclude.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome Men who, determined to &s;ucceed in their De&s;igns, are utterly regardle&s;s of Truth, and &s;o indifferent to the Shame of being detected in a Fal&s;ehood; that they never reflect whether the Facts they affirm are

true or fal&s;e. This Part you have acted; being determined at all Events, to de&s;troy the Reputation of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>

In &s;ome of your inflammatory Publi|cations you did not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, that the A&s;&s;embly had employed the Publick Money in hiring the Indians to de&s;troy the back Inhabitants. But tho' the Author of the <HI>Preface</HI> to Mr. <HI>Galloway</HI>'s Speech, &s;oon after tax'd you with downright <HI>Lying</HI> on the Occa&s;ion, you have never thought fit to deny the Charge, nor indeed will you ever be able to wipe off the Infamy with which you have thereby covered your&s;elves. I mu&s;t beg Leave, however, to repeat &s;ome of that Author's Words, as I think them very expre&s;&s;ive of your Conduct.
<Q>Are there not, &s;ays he, Pamphlets continually written and daily &s;old in our Streets to ju&s;tify and encourage a Spirit of Riot and Violence? &mdash;Are not the mad armed Mob in tho&s;e Writings in&s;ti|gated to imbrue their Hands in the Blood of their Fellow Citizens;&mdash;by fir&s;t applauding their Murder of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then repre&s;enting the A&s;&s;embly and their Friends as wor&s;e than <HI>Indians,</HI> as having privately &s;tirr'd up the <HI>Indians</HI> to murder the white People, and arm'd and rewarded them for that Purpo&s;e?&mdash;LIES, Gentlemen, villainous as ever the Malice of Hell invented; and which to do you Ju&s;tice, not one of you believes,&mdash;tho' you would have the Mob believe them.</Q></P>
<P>To proceed,&mdash;In hopes that &s;ome of your &s;landerous Slime might &s;tick, you wickedly a&s;&s;ert, That
<Q>when a Peace was concluded, they (the Quakers) wiped away the Blood &s;hed by the Indians without obliging them to return our Captives;</Q>

<PB N="7" REF="009892_0012_0F7AD57ED23DA1C8">
the <HI>wiping away</HI> the Blood is an "Indian Idiom" for making of Peace. I &s;ay you have <HI>wickedly</HI> a&s;&s;erted this, as I am convinced that you mu&s;t at the very Time have known, that the Me&s;&s;ages of Invitation to the Indians were &s;ent by the <HI>Governor;</HI> that the Negotiations were conducted by <HI>him,</HI> with the <HI>Advice</HI> of his <HI>Council;</HI> that the Peace was concluded, or the Blood <HI>wiped away</HI> as you term it, by the <HI>&s;ame Authority;</HI> and that the few Quakers who attended the Treaty, were never con&s;ulted on the Occa|&s;ion, and even the Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners were but &s;eldom treated with that Re&s;pect. Had either of the&s;e been the Ca&s;e, the Mea&s;ure you complain of would have been at lea&s;t recommended.&mdash;If this Step was prudent or nece&s;&s;ary, it was the Province of the <HI>Governor,</HI> and tho&s;e who had the Management of the Treaty under their Direc|tion, to in&s;i&s;t on and enforce it. And, if any Per&s;ons are culpable, they mu&s;t be tho&s;e who&s;e Duty it was to obtain a Re&s;titution of the Captives, and not tho&s;e who had the Inclination without the Power. But if, Reverend Sirs, it was your Opinion, that it was the Duty of others, be&s;ides the executive Part of Government
<Q>to oblige the Indians to return our Captives</Q>
why did <HI>you</HI> not perform this important Service? It was <HI>as much</HI> in <HI>your Power</HI> as in that of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and &s;ome of you actually attended the Treaty. Was it becau&s;e you at that Time had really but little Concern about the Captives? Or was it becau&s;e you had not then re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide the arduous Duties of your &s;acred Offices, for the Sake of Politics and becom|ing Politicians?&mdash;Give me leave to tell you &s;eriou&s;ly, that the Zeal you, and tho&s;e you can influence, have lately &s;hown in vilifying the <HI>Quakers,</HI> is thought, by the &s;en&s;ible moderate Men of every Per&s;ua&s;ion in the Province, to be owing to your <HI>political De&s;igns.</HI> It is imagined, that you expect you &s;hall, by rendering the Quakers odious, recommend your&s;elves to the Proprietors, and thereby the ea&s;ier engro&s;s all Power, and reduce all other Societies, the Church of England not excepted, to your Will and

Plea&s;ure, as your Society have in a great Degree already done in &s;everal other of his Maje&s;ty's Colonies.</P>
<P>IN the next Sentence you tell us, that you
<Q>put &pound;. 500, into the Hands of the Governor, who entru&s;ted it to the Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners, to redeem our Cap|tives &s;o &s;hamefully de&s;erted.</Q>
I am obliged to you, Gentlemen, for this Di&s;covery. It &s;eems then that the Authors of &s;o many bold Untruths and uncharitable Cen&s;ures, as are contained in the Letter before me, are the &s;ame Per&s;ons who gave into the Governor's Hands &pound;. 500, for the Redemption of Captives.&mdash;And when I have Recour&s;e to the Receipt &s;igned by the Governor for that Money, I find it was paid by the Corporation for the Relief of Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters, their Widows and Children,&mdash;not out of your private Pur&s;es, or from any Contributions of your Society in this Province, as you have left the World to conclude; but from the cha|ritable Donations of the good People of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> for this <HI>very Purpo&s;e,</HI> and not for the Purpo&s;e to which you have applied the Bulk of tho&s;e Donations. Wherein then does your <HI>Charity</HI> con&s;i&s;t? Is it in abu&s;ing your Neighbours, and a&s;&s;uming the <HI>Charity</HI> of <HI>others</HI> to <HI>your&s;elves?</HI> But are you not yet a&s;hamed to keep the <HI>Amount</HI> of this Donation a <HI>Secret</HI> from the World&mdash;and not give an Account thereof either to the Contributors in Europe, or to the People of this Province? The fir&s;t have a Right to expect it, becau&s;e the Money was theirs, and it was given by them on this expre&s;s Condition; and the latter, becau&s;e it was given to relieve them from an Expence which otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have nece&s;&s;arily provided for.</P>
<P>And are you not al&s;o a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that the Governor entru&s;ted the Money to the <HI>Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners;</HI> when you know in your own Con&s;ciences, that they never received a &s;ingle Farthing, or had the lea&s;t Direction in the Di&s;po&s;al of it; but that it was entru&s;ted by Governor <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to two Gentlemen of <HI>your own Religion,</HI>

for the Purpo&s;es you intended it, and for which they are accountable to the Governor? To prove that you mu&s;t have been con&s;cious of this, and, that the

by the <HI>Publick</HI> as you repre&s;ent, but that their not being relieved, was owing to a &s;udden Turn of Indian Affairs; I &s;hall in&s;ert a Copy of a Note &s;ent by one of you to the Secretary, and by him laid before the Commi&s;&s;ioners. viz.</P>

This would be acting the Part of Men of Honour and Hone&s;ty. It would give the Contributors in England the Satisfac|tion the are entitled to, which they have often complained of the Want of; and which they will undoubtedly find out Mea&s;ures to compel you to do, &s;hould you trifle with them much longer.</P>
<P>I will follow you &s;till further in your boa&s;ted Cha|rities to the back Inhabitants.
<Q>When ready to peri&s;h for want of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life," you &s;ay, "our Society &s;ent them &pound;. 150, and &s;oon after Collections were made by every Religious Society in this City, the Quakers only excepted.</Q>
It is not my Inclination to depreciate from the Charities of any Religious Society; nor would I willingly employ my Pen to &s;o odious and unchri&s;tian a Purpo&s;e. This kind of Work, I would chu&s;e to leave to &s;uch Lovers of Defamation and Fal&s;ehood as are the Authors of the Letter in que&s;tion. I have Rea&s;on to know, that there are many worthy Re|ligious and Loyal Subjects among the Pre&s;byterians in this Province; and I am confident there would be yet many more, had you confined your&s;elves to the Duties of your &s;acred Functions, and never dabbled in Politicks. A Science you do not under&s;tand; or did you, you could not put your Knowledge in Practice, con&s;i&s;tent with your Stations in Life, and the Offices you have under|taken. The Influence you have among your People in the City, the Authority you have a&s;&s;umed over all the Pre&s;byterian Clergy, and their Congregations in the Country, to which the Majority of them implicitly &s;ubmit, as is plain by the ready Obedience they paid to your <HI>Circular Letter,</HI> de&s;cribing the Change from a

Proprietary to a Royal Government, as productive of their <HI>Ruin,</HI> and the great Indu&s;try and Pains you have taken to render the latter <HI>odious,</HI> mu&s;t have had &s;ome Effect with them, and cooled, if not totally alienated the Affections of many from the Per&s;on of their Sovereign. For this Peice of Service, his Maje&s;ty and Mini&s;try have few others to reward but your&s;elves, and a noted <HI>Church of England</HI> Clergyman, who has by uncommon Effrontery repeatedly impo&s;ed on the Clergy of Eminence in our Mother Country.&mdash;But it is more than probable, that the Time is near when you will all be &s;tripp'd of your borrowed Plumes.&mdash;Pardon this Di&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is I &s;ay, a Ta&s;k no ways agreeable to me, to com|pare the Conduct of different religious Societies: And yet when the Slanders publi&s;hed by the Mini&s;ters of one Sect, render the Compari&s;on nece&s;&s;ary for the Vindication of another, there needs but little Apology. I &s;hall there|fore lay before you, tho&s;e Sums of Money which the Quakers have generou&s;ly be&s;towed on the Frontier Inha|bitants to relieve their Di&s;tre&s;s, and to re&s;tore Peace to our Borders in which tho&s;e poor People were &s;o much intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1755, the Quakers, affected with the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Frontier Inhabitants, who were then attacked by the French and Indians, were the <HI>only</HI> People that &s;ent them any Relief.&mdash;They rai&s;ed in the City of Philadelphia, upwards of Five Hundred Pounds, and faithfully di&s;tributed it among them.&mdash;The Friends in the Country al&s;o join'd in this Charity, and di&s;patched &s;everal Waggon Loads of Provi&s;ions for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of tho&s;e who were rendered de&s;titute of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life. Who were to be relieved?&mdash;not Quakers, for you agree the Quakers are chiefly in the three interior Cities. They were People of other Societies, and principally of your own. At this Time your Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion were not even moved,&mdash;all your Charity lay fa&s;t a&s;leep!&mdash;What a grateful Return have you then made for this early and
<PB N="12" REF="009892_0017_0F7AD584C9A36C28">
&s;ea&s;onable Act of Benevolence! For their Charity you have given them Abundence of Slander and Abu&s;e&mdash;And for Brotherly Love and Good Will towards your Society, you have endeavoured to ruin their Reputation as a People with all Mankind.</P>
<P>AND, at the very Time you &s;ent up the &pound;. 150, you mention, to the Frontiers, the Quakers in the Country Meetings al&s;o made Collections for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and &s;ent up &s;everal Sums of Money to relieve the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor People; and you have acknowleged in one of your former Publications, that &s;ome
<Q>worthy Individuals (among the Quakers) in the City, contributed on the Occa&s;ion.</Q>
It is true, the Quakers as a Society, did not at this Time rai&s;e any Money in the City.&mdash;Their Rea&s;ons were,&mdash;That the Application for Relief was fir&s;t made to other Societies&mdash;to whom it came naturally fir&s;t, as their People were the Objects in Di&s;tre&s;s. However, the Qua|kers in the City, had a Meeting on the Occa&s;ion, and upon Enquiry, found that the Sums of Money which had been already collected were &s;o liberal, that they were more than &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.&mdash; And &s;o it afterwards proved; for a Part of the Money &s;ent up to Cumberland and other Places, remained in the Hands of the Per&s;ons to whom &s;ent, <HI>undi&s;tributed</HI> for <HI>many Months</HI> after.&mdash;And yet this did not prevent their re&s;olving (as appears by their Minutes) that they would largely contri|bute in the <HI>Winter</HI> Sea&s;on, when in all Probability, the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Frontiers would demand much greater Relief.&mdash;In Pur&s;uance of this Re&s;olution, it is well known upwards of &pound;. 500, was &s;ub&s;cribed, a Part of it di&s;po&s;ed of, and a Part remains for want of Objects: As does likewi&s;e a great Part of the Money rai&s;ed &s;everal Years before by your Mi&s;&s;ionary in Europe for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE were the only Motives that prevented the Quakers from contributing at this Time, as they had done before, to the Relief of the Frontiers. To have added to the Sums then rai&s;ed for this Purpo&s;e, would
<PB N="13" REF="009892_0018_0F7AD5858AF5D8E0">
have been Wantone&s;s, not Charity, would have &s;avoured more of Pride than Prudence. But any Rea&s;on &s;uited your Purpo&s;e better than the true One, as you were determined to defame a whole Society of People, the Objects of your Envy and inveterate Malice, which was out of your Power to do, while you adhered to Truth. You therefore after racking your Invention to find out a Fal&s;ehood to &s;erve your Purpo&s;e, a&s;&s;ert,
<Q>We know of no other Rea&s;on for this Conduct but an <HI>envious Temper,</HI> becau&s;e the Frontier Counties who are of different Denominations, mu&s;t &s;hare the <HI>Power</HI> with them which they now <HI>abu&s;e.</HI></Q>
It &s;eems then the Quakers have <HI>Power.</HI> And permit me to a&s;k you why &s;hould they not? Are they not in every Re&s;pect as much entitled to it as any others?&mdash;Have they not Life, Liberty and Property to be repre&s;ented and protected as well as others? And have they not given as full Proof of a faithful and loyal Attachment to their Sovereign and his Government as tho&s;e of any other Society, and much more than tho&s;e of your own who have been under your particular Influence? It is true, you have taken great Pains to repre&s;ent the People of that Society as principled again&s;t granting Aids to the Crown, and again&s;t paying the Taxes for the Defence of the Province. You have made U&s;e of a Petition pre&s;ented to the A&s;&s;embly, &s;et on foot by a mi&s;chievous wrongheaded Man among them, who, with all his Art and Influence, could obtain but 29 Per&s;ons be&s;ides him&s;elf to &s;ign it; and you have ba&s;ely impo&s;ed it on the World as an Act of the whole Society, tho' you well knew that the A&s;&s;em|bly, even when compo&s;ed of a great Majority of Quakers, have granted &s;everal Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds to the Crown, for tho&s;e very Purpo&s;es. You have al&s;o taken Advantage of the Conduct of the &s;ame ob&s;tinate Per&s;on, in refu&s;ing to pay his Taxes; tho' you knew there were not one in a Thou&s;and of that Society, but paid them with as much Chearfulne&s;s as any of the King's Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009892_0019_0F7AD58648D907A8">GREAT as your Enmity is to Quakers, you cannot, Rev. Sirs, charge that Sect with having ever attempted to behead or depo&s;e their Sovereign, or with trea&s;onable Con&s;piracies, Murders, Riots, or illegal Oppo&s;ition to Government. On the contrary, it is well known to the World, that this Province was fir&s;t &s;ettled by Quakers; it's Government carried on, and it's Peace and Welfare promoted, by Mea&s;ures founded on Wi&s;dom and Prudence; the be&s;t Legi&s;lative Regulations were made, and Ju&s;tice admini&s;tred with the &s;tricte&s;t Rectitude at Home, while Peace and Amity were carefully cultivated with the Natives abroad; and tho&s;e very Indians, who&s;e Intere&s;t it was to de&s;troy the White People, were, by their con|&s;ummate Policy, made in&s;trumental in promoting the Settlement and Welfare of the Colony. And the &s;ame Policy had &s;till continued, and the Happine&s;s of the People been equally promoted, had not Proprietary pri|vate Intere&s;t interfered and prevented.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, before I leave this Point, to contra&s;t the Conduct of the Quakers with your own, and tho&s;e under your Influence. The Quakers have ever virtuou&s;ly exerted them&s;elves in favour of the ju&s;t Rights and Liberties of Mankind, and have endeavoured to re&s;train the Proprietary Power within its proper Bounds: You, on the other Hand, have join'd with that Power, in the fooli&s;h and vain Expectation of u&s;urping the Whole.&mdash;The Quakers have ever &s;upported the Government, its Laws and Con&s;titution, and that again&s;t all rebellious Riots and Attempts to tread it under Foot: You, and tho&s;e under your Influence, have been either the Principals or Abettors of all the Riots that have been in&s;olently rai&s;ed in Defiance of Government and its Laws, as your many in&s;idious Writings, and the Letter now before me will te&s;tify. The Quakers, at the Reque&s;t of the Government, united with others in defending it again&s;t the Rioters: But the Congregation under your Care, one or two at mo&s;t excepted, were either pa&s;&s;ive,
<PB N="15" REF="009892_0020_0F7AD58728EC5568">
if not joyful Spectators of the imminent Danger, or intermixed with them, abetting and encouraging their horrid De&s;ign. The Quakers, when they found Life, Liberty and Property were no longer &s;ecure under a P&mdash;y Government, did, from a <HI>perfect Confidence</HI> in their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> unite in petitioning for a <HI>Royal Govern|ment;</HI> while you were employed in &s;preading <HI>Di&s;affec|tion</HI> to the <HI>King,</HI> and an <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> to a <HI>Kingly Government</HI> among your whole People; and in prevailing not only on the Men, but even Children at School to petition again&s;t it.&mdash;The Quakers have expended many Thou|&s;and Pounds towards re&s;toring Peace to, and relieving the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Frontier Inhabitants, and the Re|demption of Captives, tho' &s;carcely any of their Society are &s;ettled there; while you have only contributed a pitiful &pound;. 150, for one of the&s;e Purpo&s;es, tho' the People of your Society were the very Objects that were to be benefited and relieved. Thus, Reverend Sirs, had you the lea&s;t Degree of Candor, you would confe&s;s, that the Quakers have uniformly &s;hewn by their Actions that they are govern'd by the Principles of Rea&s;on, and are Friends to good Government: That while they have with Steadine&s;s promoted the true Intere&s;t and Happine&s;s of the Country, and oppo&s;ed the arbitrary and tyranni|cal Mea&s;ures of a private Subject, they have at the &s;ame Time exerted them&s;elves in maintaining and defending even the Government that was occa&s;ionally oppre&s;&s;ing them, again&s;t every audacious Attempt that has been made to de&s;troy its Laws, and annihilate its Power. And, to do you Ju&s;tice, Gentlemen, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, you have not been le&s;s uniform in the Execution of your Plan of trampling on all Government and Order: For it is well known it was tho&s;e under the Influence of one of you, that formed the Riot in Gov. <HI>Morris</HI>'s Admini&s;tration, which was intended to intimidate the A&s;&s;embly into the arbitrary and unju&s;t Mea&s;ures of the Proprietaries.&mdash;It was People of the &s;ame Society, that perpetrated the Murders at
<PB N="16" REF="009892_0021_0F7AD588632924F8">
<HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> which you can, con&s;i&s;tent with your Religion, even endeavour to ju&s;tify. It was the &s;ame People that committed that daring In&s;ult on the Government at <HI>Germantown,</HI> and have &s;ince that &s;eized and de&s;troyed <HI>the Goods of the</HI> CROWN, and impudently declared, "that they were <HI>better Judges</HI> of what was right to be done in America, than their <HI>Sovereign</HI> and the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> united." You formerly join'd with the Pro|prietaries again&s;t the A&s;&s;embly, contrary to your own and the Rights of your Fellow Subjects, and you now unite with the &s;ame Power again&s;t the Rights of His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf. Uniformly you have acted indeed, but with how much Reputation and Credit to your&s;elves and your Society, the candid Part of Mankind will here|after determine.</P>
<P>BUT this Want of Charity in the Quakers proceeds as you alledge from an
<Q><HI>envious Temper,</HI> becau&s;e the Frontier Inhabitants mu&s;t &s;hare the Power with them.</Q> To prevent this, you &s;ay, <Q>they have in forming the new Counties &s;o ordered it, that but ten Repre&s;entatives are &s;ent from five frontier Counties, and twenty &s;ix from the three interior Counties under the Quakers Influence.</Q>
It is no uncommon Thing to find Men who have invented a Fal&s;ehood to promote their wicked De&s;igns, to lo&s;e them&s;elves when they attempt to offer Rea&s;ons in Support of it. This certainly is your Cir|cum&s;tance; for can there be any Rea&s;on or Cau&s;e for <HI>envying</HI> a Power which the Frontiers do not enjoy, and which you declare the Quakers have &s;o ordered, that they cannot exerci&s;e it.&mdash;This weak Rea&s;on for the Quakers Uncharitablene&s;s I &s;hall leave at pre&s;ent for you to mend, or to invent a new One, as &s;hall be mo&s;t agree|able to you.&mdash; But why would you venture thus, without the lea&s;t Foundation, to impute to the Quakers a Pa&s;&s;ion which it is here &s;o well known, may, with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice and Propriety, be charged to your&s;elves. <HI>Envy,</HI> and a <HI>Thir&s;t after Power,</HI> are your characteri&s;tic Pa&s;&s;ions.
<PB N="17" REF="009892_0022_0F7AD588C2EE5DC0">
Envy at the Encrea&s;e, Happine&s;s and Promotion of the Church of England and the Quaker Religion, is what de&s;troys your Peace, and renders you thus re&s;tle&s;s and tumultuous: And Thir&s;t after Power, never to be &s;atiated until all other Societies are reduced to your Domain, is the chief Motive of your late Conduct. It requires no great Depth of Penetration to perceive this Truth.&mdash; Should the Frontiers &s;ucceed in their unrea&s;onable De|mand, which has &s;prung entirely from your Policy, the Legi&s;lative Power would be in the Hands of your Sect, and your whole Scheme of Dominion executed at once. Hence ari&s;es your Complaint that the Frontiers are not ju&s;tly repre&s;ented. And do you then &s;eriou&s;ly think, that a People who have thus gro&s;sly abu&s;ed the Share of Power they at pre&s;ent enjoy, who have trampled on all Laws both human and divine, to gratify their frantic Rage and &s;uper&s;titious Fury, and who have &s;purned at, defied and in&s;ulted the Powers of Government it&s;elf, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with more? This Que&s;tion, if I am right in judging from your pa&s;t Conduct, you will certainly an&s;wer in the Affirmative: For you &s;eem deter|mined to &s;ucceed in your Plan at all Adventures. Hence it is that you de&s;erted the &s;acred Duties of your Profe&s;&s;ion for the Sake of Politicks. Hence it is that you have long &s;ince laid your Schemes to render your own Sect the mo&s;t numerous and powerful in <HI>America.</HI> Hence it is that all tho&s;e Riots and Tumults which have put an End to all Government in the Province, encouraged and countenanced by your Performances, have ari&s;en. And from the&s;e Motives have proceeded all your fal&s;e Clamours, groundle&s;s Abu&s;e and infamous Calumnies again&s;t the Quakers, who&s;e Merit has recommended them to that Confidence of the People of other Societies, which your own never could obtain; and who&s;e Conduct in Support of the Government and its Laws again&s;t the mo&s;t wicked Attempts, has been a Mountain of Oppo&s;ition in your Progre&s;s to lawle&s;s Power, the great Object of

your Wi&s;hes. Be not deceived, Rev.

<P>BUT to proceed in manife&s;ting the Weakne&s;s of the Foundation upon which you attempt to erect your Power:
<Q>The Charter, <HI>you &s;ay,</HI> allows to every County four Members at lea&s;t to repre&s;ent them,</Q>
and that the Frontiers "de&s;ire this Privilege." Here you di&s;cover the Folly of Divines when they undertake to expound Temporal Laws. In the Year 1701, the <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>Territories</HI> were united in Legi&s;lation; they con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix Counties, three in each: The Proprietor and People finding the Original Frame of Government defective, agreed on a new Charter; the whole Number of Repre|&s;entatives was &s;ettled at Twenty-four, i. e. four for each County. And therefore the Charter, in erecting and proportioning the Legi&s;lative Authority of the Counties then laid out; declares, in &sect;. 2.
<Q>That there &s;hall be an A&s;&s;embly yearly cho&s;en by the Freemen thereof, to con&s;i&s;t of four Per&s;ons out of each County;</Q>
making in the Whole the Number intended.&mdash;But as there was then a Probability, from &s;ome Differences &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Members of the three Counties of the Pro|vince, and tho&s;e of the three Counties of the Territories, that they would &s;eparate in Legi&s;lation, in the &s;ub&s;equent Part of the Charter a Power is given to them for that Purpo&s;e: And, in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;eparate, it was further declared, that the Inhabitants of each of the three Counties of this Province &s;hould not have le&s;s than 8 Members to repre&s;ent them in A&s;&s;embly, without the lea&s;t Direction for the future Regulation of the Conduct of the Government, in forming <HI>new Counties.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009892_0024_0F7AD58A2A0337F0">IMMEDIATELY after the Execution of this Charter, the Province and Territories &s;eparated; and each of the three <HI>Provincial</HI> Counties elected and &s;ent to the Seat of Legi&s;lation 8 Members, making up the Number 24, as the Charter directed. And the three <HI>Lower Counties</HI> &s;ent 18, <HI>i. e.</HI> Six for each County, to their A&s;&s;embly; I &s;uppo&s;e by Virtue of a Law made for that Purpo&s;e. Hence the Meaning and De&s;ign of the Charter appears to be no more than to a&s;certain the Number of Mem|bers for each of the Counties <HI>then in being;</HI> and to limit that of the Provincial A&s;&s;embly to 24, leaving the &s;ub|&s;equent Legi&s;latures to grant &s;uch a Number of Repre|&s;entatives to the new Counties, if any &s;hould thereafter be erected, as upon Con&s;ideration of their Circum&s;tances &s;hould appear prudent and &s;afe. Any other Con&s;truc|tion of the Charter mu&s;t be ab&s;urd and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the Number of Repre&s;entatives that ought to be in any Country, and much le&s;s in a new One, on equitable Principles. I know of no Rule to fix their Proportions, but the Number of Taxables, and the Quantity of Money they pay to|wards the Defence and Support of the Government. And as the Number and Quantity of the&s;e are &s;ubject to continual Encrea&s;e and Changes, even this Mode mu&s;t be attended with Difficulties if carried &s;trictly into Practice.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, let us for once agree on this as a Rule, as we know of no better at pre&s;ent, and thereby examine into the Ju&s;tice of the Complaint of the Frontier Counties, that they are not <HI>equally repre&s;ented.</HI> To determine the Matter, we mu&s;t fix on one County as a <HI>Standard:</HI> None can be &s;ettled as &s;uch with more Propriety than the County of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t opulent and numerous, and contains a greater Number of Men, who under&s;tand Government and Laws. Now the County of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> contains about 8300 Taxables, and pays towards the Support and Defence of the Govern|ment annually, upwards of &pound;. 12,400, and &s;ends eight

<P>In Proportion to the publick Taxes paid by any Part of the Pro|vince, we mu&s;t naturally conclude there is an Intere&s;t to defend; &s;o that whatever Number of Members <HI>Cumberland</HI> County may require to defend a Property that pays &pound;. 1200, it mu&s;t naturally follow, that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> County which pays above ten Times that Sum, &s;hould at lea&s;t have ten Times the Number of Repre&s;entatives, and the other Counties in the &s;ame Proportion.</P></NOTE> Thus you find, upon a candid and fair Examination that the Complaint which you have wickedly infu&s;ed into the Heads of the Frontier Inhabitants again&s;t the Quakers, is without the lea&s;t Ju&s;tice or Foundation The Frontier Counties are upon the whole, as fully repre&s;ented as the fir&s;t and principal County in the Province.&mdash;Indeed they are not equally repre&s;ented among them&s;elves, as one of them enjoys the Right of &s;ending one Member <HI>more</HI> than it ought, and another &s;ends one <HI>le&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing the Frontier Counties had not been equally repre&s;ented&mdash;Why is this Charge made again&s;t the Quakers? Was not the Number of the Repre&s;entatives e&s;tabli&s;hed by an Act of the whole Legi&s;lature, in which the <HI>Governor,</HI> whom you will allow was not a <HI>Quaker,</HI> had an equal Share? And permit me al&s;o to remind you that the Inhabitants, at the Time they petitioned for the&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="009892_0026_0F7AD58C1B2AC1F8">
Counties to be formed out of the old Ones, never reque&s;ted in any of their Petitions to have a &s;eparate Election.&mdash; All the Inconveniencies therein complained of, were the Di&s;tance from the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and the Difficulty of attending them to bring Malefactors to Ju&s;tice, or to recover their civil Rights, when invaded. And the Government might have remedied the Mi&s;chiefs pointed out to them, and left the People of the&s;e Counties to attend the Election of Repre&s;entatives in the old Counties, without any rea&s;onable Complaint, as has been done in two neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P>BUT what fully evinces the Ab&s;urdity of &s;ome of the back Counties complaining that their Intere&s;t &s;uffers by the interior Counties having a greater Number of Repre|&s;entatives than they, and &s;hows that they have been put upon this Mea&s;ure to an&s;wer Party Purpo&s;es, is, that they have generally elected a Part of their Repre&s;entatives from among the Inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> owing to their having hardly any Per&s;ons of &s;ufficient Lie&s;ure and Property in their own Counties, who would be at the Trouble and Expence of &s;erving them in that Capacity. So that if they were to have an additional Number allow'd them, they would be obliged to elect them from the City likewi&s;e, which would make the Ballance, if at pre&s;ent again&s;t them, &s;till greater in their Disfavour. Even tho&s;e Members who are cho&s;en among them&s;elves, can &s;carce ever be got to attend more than half a Se&s;&s;ions, alledging, that they cannot afford to be ab&s;ent &s;o long a Time from their Families and Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I am convinced, that if tho&s;e Counties were obliged to &s;end 8, or even 4 Members each, to the A&s;&s;embly, from among their own Inhabitants, and their Wages to be paid by the County, we &s;hould have much louder Complaints on that Head, than any we have yet had for Want of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add to the Evidences already given of the chari|table Di&s;po&s;ition of the Quakers towards the Pre&s;byte|rians on the Frontiers, what you mention in your Letter

Frontiers were then bleeding in every Quarter, the People in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, and the Country every Day more and more de&s;erted for want of Protection. The&s;e Things, I &s;ay, led them to think, that if the Indians could be brought to a Conference with the Government, an Explanation of their Aggrievances, if any, might be obtained, and tho&s;e Aggrievances redre&s;&s;ed; that Peace might be re&s;tored to the de&s;ponding Inhabitants of the Frontiers, and the <HI>antient Friends</HI> of the Province be taken from their new Allies the <HI>French,</HI> and re&s;tored to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t; which, at that Time, in <HI>America,</HI> had the mo&s;t unfavourable Appearance.

<P>IN pur&s;uance of this Policy, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thought of, and recommended to the Government by the <HI>Quakers.</HI> Invi|tations were &s;ent to the Indians, and the Treaty at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> held with them.

<PB N="24" REF="009892_0029_0F7AD58DC8DEFB18">
Governor at <HI>Tiagon,</HI> a Northern Settlement of Indians, the &s;alutary Effects of this Mea&s;ure were obvious. Ho&s;ti|lities immediately cea&s;ed on our Northern Frontiers, a Stop was put to the mo&s;t cruel Deva&s;tations, and Peace for a Time re&s;tored to tho&s;e unhappy People, which the Province at that Time was unable to procure from any other Mea&s;ure whatever.</P>
<P>AFTER this the <HI>fir&s;t Treaty</HI> at <HI>Ea&s;ton</HI> was held; the Tru&s;tees of the <HI>Friendly A&s;&s;ociation</HI> attended it, and offered their Pur&s;e and their Services to the Government; the Governor chearfully accepted their Pre&s;ents, and gave them to the Indians in their Names, together with another from the Government.</P>
<P>AND, at the <HI>&s;econd Treaty</HI> at <HI>Ea&s;ton,</HI> the Tru&s;tees again waited on the Governor with a written Addre&s;s, and offered their Service; he was pleas'd to approve of their Conduct, agreed to accept their Pre&s;ents, and invited them to attend the Treaty; which they accordingly did, to the Satisfaction of the Governor, with who&s;e Approbation their Pre&s;ents were at this Time al&s;o deli|vered to the Indians.</P>
<P>THE good Effects of the&s;e, with &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent Treaties, were &s;oon felt; the Frontier Inhabitants were made ea&s;y, many Lives were &s;aved, the Complaints of the Indians again&s;t the Proprietors were &s;ettled, and a fortunate I&s;&s;ue put to their &s;avage Depredations; which could not otherwi&s;e have been effected, without an immen&s;e Expence of both Blood and Trea&s;ure. Thus benevolent and charitable, and founded on the wi&s;e&s;t Policy, were the Pre&s;ents given by the&s;e People, with the <HI>Approbation</HI> of the Governor, to the Indians, which you, Reverend Sirs, have ba&s;ely repre&s;ented as proceeding from a greater Re&s;pect and Regard for the Enemy, than for the People of the Province.</P>
<P>THAT the Indians have had frequent ju&s;t Cau&s;es of Complaint again&s;t the Proprietaries and their Agents, may be &s;een in a Pamphlet written in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and

<P>You next proceed to relate the Feats of the Provincials and Volunteers, in de&s;troying the Indian Towns, and their Corn; and to give an Account, &s;uch as it is, of that <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>heroic</HI> Action of de&s;troying the Indians at <HI>Cone&s;togo</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> Let us have it in your own Words, for I think there is &s;omething curious in them;
<Q>They (the Volunteers) &s;ay you, returned enraged to find that an Indian Town of about 20 or 30 Per&s;ons&punc; had now informed their Friends again&s;t whom our Men had marched, and who were perfidiou&s;ly playing the &s;ame Pranks as they did la&s;t War; they marched to their Town and cut off &s;ome of them, others fled to a Borough called <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and there they came and cut them off.

Had you &s;ucceeded, you would no doubt have laid them before the Government, to &s;how that they were Enemies, or at lea&s;t that they adhered to the Enemies. But Nothing of this kind has been done; and therefore the whole Province mu&s;t be convinced, that all your Accu&s;ations again&s;t them are founded in Policy, not in Truth. They were indeed invented after the Fact done, to palliate a Deed

<P><Q>I am al&s;o to lay before you a Piece of Intelligence I received from <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, which has given me the utmo&s;t Concern.&mdash;On the Fourteenth In&s;tant, a Number of People, well armed and mounted, went to the <HI>Indian</HI> Town in <HI>Cone&s;togo</HI> Manor, and, <HI>without the lea&s;t Rea&s;on or Provocation, in cool Blood, barbarou&s;ly killed</HI> &s;ix of the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ettled there, and would probably have treated all the re&s;t with the <HI>&s;ame Cruelty,</HI> had they not providentially been abroad at that Time; and after burning all their Hou&s;es, the Perpetrators of this <HI>inhumane</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> Action re|tired.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As the <HI>Indians</HI> were <HI>&s;eated</HI> on the Manor by the <HI>Government,</HI> and had lived there <HI>peaceably and inoffen|&s;ively</HI> during <HI>all</HI> our late Troubles, I conceived they were as much under the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> and its <HI>Laws,</HI> as <HI>any others</HI> among&s;t us; where|fore I thought it my Duty to do every Thing in my Power for the immediate apprehending and bringing to Ju&s;tice the Authors of this <HI>horrid Scene;</HI> and accordingly, by the <HI>Advice</HI> of the <HI>Council,</HI> I have di&s;patched Letters to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Lanca&s;ter, Cumberland</HI> and <HI>York</HI> Counties, requiring and charging them to exert them&s;elves, and endeavour, by all
<PB N="29" REF="009892_0034_0F7AD5930D406908">
po&s;&s;ible Means, to di&s;cover and &s;ecure the Principals concerned in this <HI>outrageous Act,</HI> and their Accom|plices. I am al&s;o preparing a Proclamation, ordering and requiring all Officers, civil and military, and all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects in this Government, to be aid|ing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the Magi&s;trates in the Execution of the Laws on this unhappy Occa&s;ion.&mdash;Such of the <HI>Cone&s;togoe Indians</HI> as had the good Fortune to e&s;cape the <HI>Fury</HI> of the abovementioned <HI>lawle&s;s Party,</HI> are now taken under the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Magi&s;tracy at Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and are &s;ecured in the Workhou&s;e there, but are in great Di&s;tre&s;s for Want of Nece&s;&s;aries and Apparel, having lo&s;t every Thing, except the little they had on their Backs, in their Hou&s;es, which were burnt.&mdash;As they do not apprehend them&s;elves to be &s;afe where they are, they have, by a verbal Me&s;&s;age by one of your Members, reque&s;ted of me that they may be removed to this City, or its Neighbourhood; and I am <HI>very ready</HI> to <HI>comply</HI> immediately with <HI>their De&s;ire,</HI> provided you will enable me to defray the Ex|pence of it.</Q></P>
<P>AND in another Me&s;&s;age, dated <HI>January</HI> 3, 1764, his Honour has the&s;e Words, viz.</P>
<P><Q>I WAS preparing a Me&s;&s;age, to inform you of the <HI>cruel</HI> MASSACRE of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Work-Hou&s;e of the Borough of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> on the 27th of la&s;t Month, by a <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>lawle&s;s</HI> Sett of <HI>Rioters,</HI> when I received a Me&s;&s;age by two of your Members, that you were already made fully acquainted with the Particulars of that <HI>horrid Scene of Barbarity,</HI> and <HI>in&s;olent and daring violation of the Laws.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WIDELY different indeed, Reverend Sirs, is this De|&s;cription of the <HI>Facts</HI> from that you have ba&s;ely impo&s;ed on the People in <HI>England.</HI> You here find the Governor and his Council, who are far more proper Judges of the Matter, than Per&s;ons in your clerical Offices,&mdash;declare, that the&s;e unhappy <HI>Indians</HI> were
<Q>&s;eated on the Manor
<PB N="30" REF="009892_0035_0F7AD593D0D4E620">
by the <HI>Government,</HI>&mdash;that they had lived there <HI>peace|ably</HI> and <HI>inoffen&s;ively,</HI> during all our late Troubles,&mdash; that they were as much under its <HI>Protection</HI> and its <HI>Laws</HI> as <HI>any others</HI> among&s;t us,&mdash;and that they were <HI>barba|rou&s;ly killed,</HI> nay <HI>cruelly ma&s;&s;acred,</HI> in <HI>cool Blood</HI> without the <HI>lea&s;t Rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>Provocation.</HI></Q>
Certainly then, let the&s;e Actions be "painted" by <HI>Quakers</HI> or <HI>others,</HI> they convey the full Idea of a <HI>"Ma&s;&s;acre</HI> and a mo&s;t <HI>horrid Murder."</HI> How then &s;hall we account for the Offence you have taken at the Terms applied to them, and your Manner of glo&s;&s;ing over this mo&s;t infernal Villainy? Is it becau&s;e you are attached to every Villain, and would &s;creen him from the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of the Laws, who is of the &s;ame Denomination of Religion with your&s;elves?&mdash;or becau&s;e you think it no Offence to take away the Life of a human Creature who is of a different Colour or Per&s;ua&s;ion?</P>
<P>INDEED, &s;everal of your Writers in favour of the <HI>Paxton Men,</HI> have before expre&s;&s;ed much Re&s;entment, that the <HI>Killing</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould be called <HI>Murder.</HI> One of them in particular, &s;peaking of the worthy Author of the <HI>Narrative,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Ab&s;tract of the <HI>Narrative</HI> of the Ma&s;&s;acres in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> County, was publi&s;hed in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> for April, 1764. And in the Magazine for <HI>June,</HI> was in&s;erted a Piece, entituled,
<Q>An impartial Account of the Ri&s;e and Proceedings of the <HI>Paxton</HI> Volunteers,</Q>
by way of <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the <HI>Narrative.</HI> This Piece, it is &s;aid, was compiled, by Order of the Pr&mdash;rs, from the <HI>Plain Dealers,</HI> and other virulent Publications of the Pr&mdash;ry Party, in hopes of prejudicing His Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters again&s;t the Quakers, as they had formerly done by the Publication of the <HI>Brief State</HI> and <HI>Brief View,</HI> which aimed at obtaining an Act of Parliament for rendering Quakers inca|pable of holding Offices in this Government.&mdash;The numerous vile Fal&s;ehoods, however, of the Account publi&s;hed in the <HI>June</HI> Magazine, will readily appear upon the Peru&s;al of the authentic Documents con|tained in this Addre&s;s.</NOTE> has the&s;e Words, viz. <Q>But it &s;eems this Gentleman was determined to avail him&s;elf of any Thing, that he thought might bring Infamy and Odium upon the <HI>Paxton People;</HI> and for this End he has not <HI>&s;crupled</HI> to call the <HI>Killing</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="009892_0036_0F7AD5948B6E8F38">
MURDER! &mdash;But I am per&s;uaded this Writer, with all his Ingenuity, will find it too hard a Ta&s;k to prove it <HI>Murder.</HI></Q>
&mdash;Now, to convince this ab&s;urd Author, and another equally ab&s;urd who dates his Letter from <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> that it is not &s;o <HI>hard a Ta&s;k,</HI> nor does require &s;o much <HI>Ingenuity</HI> as they repre&s;ent, to prove that the <HI>Killing</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> was properly and ju&s;tly called <HI>Murder,</HI> I &s;hall give them the following Extract from a new Work, entitled, <HI>Lex Coronatoria,</HI> viz.
<Q>When a Man of the Age of Di&s;cretion, and <HI>compos mentis,</HI> unlawfully, publickly or privately, by any external Act of Violence, killeth any rea&s;onable Creature, <HI>in rerum Natura,</HI> under the King's <HI>Protection;</HI> Subject, or <HI>Alien,</HI> Chri&s;tian, or <HI>Heathen,</HI> attainted, or <HI>not at|tainted,</HI> with Malice forethought, either expre&s;s or implied; and the Party die of the Wound, or the Hurt, within the Year and the Day, <HI>this</HI> KILLING is MURDER; and even in the Ca&s;e of a Feme-Covert, if committed with the Hu&s;band, Coercion is no Plea.&mdash;Vide 1 <HI>Hale,</HI> 429, 433, 434.&mdash;<HI>Bro. Cor.</HI> 196.&mdash;<HI>Fitz. Cor.</HI> 323.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Author of <HI>The Conduct of the Paxton-Men im|partially repre&s;ented</HI> (from whom the above Quotation re&s;pecting the Author of the <HI>Narrative</HI> is made) not &s;atisfied with having thus expo&s;ed his Folly and Ignorance, has had the horrid Impiety to undertake to <HI>ju&s;tify,</HI> from <HI>Scripture,</HI> the <HI>Murdering</HI> of Per&s;ons in <HI>cool Blood,</HI> even tho' a Man may have <HI>pledg'd his Faith</HI> to them, and not|with&s;tanding he may at the very Time be <HI>receiving</HI> from them <HI>Acts of Ho&s;pitality</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> Permit me to tell you, Reverend Sirs, that when you, or tho&s;e you are connected with, publi&s;h to the World &s;uch <HI>horrid Doctrines</HI> as the&s;e, you do your&s;elves and your Cau&s;e more real Di&s;&s;ervice than would ever be in the Power of your warme&s;t Adver&s;aries: For every rational humane Being mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hold the Men who can publickly avow &s;uch <HI>Tenets</HI> in the greate&s;t Dete&s;tation! And
<PB N="32" REF="009892_0037_0F7AD5956BAFBB28">
you may depend that tho&s;e of your Society who now blindly follow you in thus <HI>vindicating Murderers,</HI> and in <HI>oppo&s;ing a Royal Government,</HI> will ultimately find them&s;elves involved in much Confu&s;ion and Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>THE next Thing that calls for my Attention is another Charge equally fal&s;e and groundle&s;s again&s;t the Quakers, &mdash;
<Q>That a Party of Indians <HI>among the Inhabitants</HI> that carried the Enemies Arms and Ammunition, and had conducted them into the Settlements, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in murdering the Inhabitants, applied to the Quakers, and they found Means to bring them down to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and have maintained them at the Expence of the Pro|vince.</Q>
Here I conclude you mean the <HI>Moravian</HI> Indians of <HI>Nain</HI> and <HI>Weketank,</HI> two Plantations of the Brethren; for no Other Indians remained among the Inha|bitants after the Ma&s;&s;acre at <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> The&s;e Indians you well know were Part of the <HI>Moravian Community,</HI> converted to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith</HI> by Mi&s;&s;ionaries of their and <HI>your</HI> Society, lived on their Lands, and were daily under their Care. They were al&s;o received, as Subjects, and taken under the Protection of the Government at their particular Reque&s;t upwards of twenty Years ago, by Governor <HI>Thomas;</HI> afterwards, in the late War, by Governors <HI>Morris</HI> and <HI>Denny.</HI> They had ever &s;ince lived peaceably and inoffen&s;ively in this Situation, if the Te&s;ti|mony of their Divines and others who were con&s;tantly re&s;ident among them may be credited.&mdash;But as they were &s;ituated near the Frontiers, &s;ome of the People of the County were &s;u&s;picious that they held a &s;ecret Corre&s;pon|dence with the Enemy: And one of them was charged with the Murder of one <HI>Stin&s;on</HI> in Company with other Indians, but was acquitted by a Jury of the County on a fair Trial. However, a Pannick &s;eized many of the Inhabitants, and Numbers declared, if tho&s;e Indians remained among them, they would de&s;ert their Habita|tions.&mdash;Several <HI>Reque&s;ts</HI> came down to the <HI>Governor</HI> to de&s;ire their Removal to &s;ome other Place.&mdash;He laid them
<PB N="33" REF="009892_0038_0F7AD59608EB91C0">
before the Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners, and at their Board it was agreed that the latter, &s;ome of them being Mem|bers of A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould lay the Matter before the Hou&s;e, with their Opinion thereon, that it was
<Q>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Indians &s;hould be removed into the interior Parts of the Province,&mdash;where their Behaviour might be more clo&s;ely ob&s;erved.</Q>
&mdash;Upon which the Hou&s;e re&s;olved,
<Q>that the Expence of their Removal and Support while it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, be defrayed by the Government.</Q>
And it is well known to the Gover|nor and the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the Quakers never interfered in the Matter, nor indeed had they the lea&s;t Connection with the&s;e Indians. This, Reverend Sirs, is the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, relative to the Tran&s;action you impute to Quakers.&mdash;It was a meer Act of <HI>Government</HI> to prevent the Evacuation of the Settlements adjoining to <HI>Nain</HI> and <HI>Weketank,</HI> and indeed of the <HI>whole County</HI> of Northampton. How then could you charge this Fact to the Quakers without Blu&s;hing? You might with equal Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on impute the Murders at <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> or the late Death of the Emperor of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to them.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince you are &s;o violent in cen&s;uring the Mea&s;ures taken by the Government, permit me to a&s;k you, What Method would your Wi&s;dom, Prudence and Humanity have dictated to you, had you had the Power in <HI>your</HI> Hands? The bringing of them down to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> it &s;eems you cen&s;ure as highly criminal, and therefore no doubt but this would be your la&s;t Re&s;olution: Would you have driven them into the Woods, and obliged them to &s;eek Protection from the Enemy, and of Con&s;equence to unite with them in their Barbarities again&s;t us? You certainly would not have done this: Common Prudence, nay common Sen&s;e forbid it.&mdash;A Mea&s;ure of this Kind which would &s;trip them of the Nece&s;&s;aries they had laid up for the Winter Sea&s;on, mu&s;t have ju&s;tly enraged them and rendered them our mo&s;t dangerous and inveterate Foes.
<PB N="34" REF="009892_0039_0F7AD597F3E5C440">
I &s;ay mo&s;t dangerous, becau&s;e be&s;ides adding to the Num|ber of our Enemies, the Men were intimately acquainted with the interior Parts of the Province, and would no doubt have acted as Spies and Conductors to Parties of foreign Indians, to the utter De&s;truction of the Country.&mdash;But one Thing el&s;e remained that could be done, and this I make no &s;cruple of &s;aying, I doubt not but your Huma|nity and Chri&s;tian Love towards them would have pointed out to you: I mean, to deprive them of their Arms, coop them up in a Pen or perhaps &s;ome &s;trong Hou&s;e, and put them all to death, Men, Women and &s;ucking Infants, in one general Ma&s;&s;acre. This, to be &s;ure, Gentlemen, would have been excellent Policy, it would have rendered the&s;e &s;u&s;pected People inoffen&s;ive indeed, and removed from the Minds of the Frontier Inhabitants all Apprehen&s;ions of Danger from them.&mdash;Am I too &s;evere in this Cen&s;ure? &mdash;Mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e that the Men who&s;e wicked Hearts without the lea&s;t Qualm or Remor&s;e can invent a Fal&s;e|hood with the iniquitous De&s;ign of bringing into Di&s;|grace a whole Society of People, can take Offence at others for calling the mo&s;t horrid Scenes of Infernal Cru|elty and Cowardice by their proper Names <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre</HI> and <HI>Murder,</HI> and can even <HI>vindicate</HI> the <HI>Perpetrators</HI> of the <HI>Savage Acts,</HI> would not he&s;itate to act on &s;uch Principles?</P>
<P>DISAGREABLE as it is to me, and unnece&s;&s;ary as it mu&s;t appear to every candid Mind, after refuting &s;uch a Num|ber of malignant Charges again&s;t the Quakers, to wade through all the Untruths contained in your Letter, yet &s;ince I have undertaken it, I &s;hall proceed. The very next Sentence to the one I have remarked on, contains another Fal&s;ehood. You a&s;&s;ert, that
<Q><HI>afterwards</HI> &s;ome of the very Indians that were beat at the Mun&s;ey-Hill, and that had their Corn de&s;troyed, &s;ued for the &s;ame Privilege, and <HI>were brought</HI> to Philadelphia, and main|tained by the Province.</Q>
&mdash;Here I again conclude your dark Expre&s;&s;ions mean the <HI>Wighalou&s;in</HI> Indians,&mdash;for none others &s;ued for the Protection of the Government, or were
<PB N="35" REF="009892_0040_0F7AD5988ABCA840">
brought down after the Moravian Tribes.&mdash;The&s;e Indi|ans were lately in the Barracks, and if any of them were in the Engagement of Mun&s;ey-Hill, why have you not informed the Government and proved the Fact? &mdash;I call on you to do it yet. And if you do not, will not all Men unite in determining that your Delight is Fal&s;ehood and Defamation, and that you are, notwith|&s;tanding your religious Profe&s;&s;ions, lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Morality and Religion?</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e Indians were brought down with the <HI>Wighalou&s;in</HI> Tribe. The Cen&s;ure cannot remain with the <HI>Quakers,</HI>&mdash;for this Tran&s;action which you have wickedly imputed to them was al&s;o the <HI>Act of the Govern|ment.</HI> The&s;e poor Indians, mo&s;t of whom are converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, being our Friends, and apprehen|&s;ive of Danger, not only from the violent Rage of the Frontier Inhabitants, but from the Enemy Indians; &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers down to treat with the <HI>Governor</HI> re&s;pecting their State of In&s;ecurity. And in their Conferences with <HI>him,</HI> intreated the Protection of the <HI>Government,</HI> and reque&s;ted that they might come down and live among us. &mdash;The <HI>Governor</HI> convinced of their Sincerity, warmly <HI>recommended,</HI> the Matter to the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> who agreed to the Mea&s;ure, and to provide for them during their Re&s;i|dence among us. This will appear from the following Me&s;&s;age, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I lay before you the Minutes of &s;everal Conferences I have held with <HI>Papounan,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Indians,</HI> who live at <HI>Wighalou&s;in,</HI> on the River <HI>Sa&s;quehanna.</HI> I have <HI>no Rea&s;on to doubt</HI> that they have di&s;clo&s;ed to me <HI>all that they really know</HI> of the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Indian</HI> War, and of the <HI>Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned</HI> by the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> in their Neighbourhood for their renewing Ho&s;tilities again&s;t us.&mdash;They have intimated to me that they, and a few others, with whom they are con|nected, being really our <HI>&s;incere Friends,</HI> are unea&s;y at their pre&s;ent Situation, and would incline to come and
<PB N="36" REF="009892_0041_0F7AD599433AC458">
live among us, if we would <HI>receive</HI> and <HI>protect</HI> them. They have been very importunate with me for an im|mediate An&s;wer, alledging, as they have been very kindly treated by us, if this Overture &s;hould be like|wi&s;e favourably accepted, that it would <HI>confirm</HI> tho&s;e who are already well di&s;po&s;ed, and al&s;o <HI>incline many others,</HI> who are at pre&s;ent <HI>in Arms</HI> again&s;t us, to &s;ue for <HI>Peace.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>THE <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> who are joined with me in the Di&s;po&s;ition of the public Money, were made acquainted with this Affair; and though they agreed with me as to the <HI>Expediency and Utility</HI> of the Mea&s;ure, yet as it would be attended with Expence, and the public Funds were nigh exhau&s;ted, we did not think proper to go into it.&mdash;I therefore recommend it to you to con&s;ider this Matter; and if you <HI>concur with me in Opinion</HI> that this will be for the public Service, and will provide a Fund on the Occa&s;ion, I de&s;ire you will give me your An&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that I may no longer detain the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are impatient to return Home with my Me&s;&s;ages.</Q></P>

<P>THUS you find, and indeed you well knew it before, that this Mea&s;ure which your Malice has imputed to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> took its Ri&s;e with the <HI>Governor,</HI> and was <HI>appro|ved</HI> of by <HI>both</HI> Branches of the Legi&s;lature. A Mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound Policy, as it prevented an Increa&s;e of the Number of our Enemies, and added to tho&s;e of our Friends. And as much &s;o with Humanity, as it afforded Protection to tho&s;e that demanded it, and relie|ved them from the Nece&s;&s;ity of uniting with the Enemy, and the Perpetration of Cruelties that their Con&s;ciences di&s;approved of.</P>
<P>TO unfold to the World all your Fal&s;ehoods is a tedious Ta&s;k, not from the Difficulty of refuting them, but from the Number you have the Art of throwing into a &s;mall Compa&s;s. You next a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e Indians,
<Q><HI>at the Reque&s;t of a Quaker</HI> Faction, were guarded by a Company of the King's Troops.</Q>
You, or &s;ome of you, Gentlemen, were on the Spot, and you mu&s;t know the Facts to be as I &s;hall now relate them.&mdash;The <HI>Govern|ment</HI> receiving daily Accounts of the avow'd De&s;ign of the Rioters, to de&s;troy the Indians in the Barracks, remo|ved them to the Province I&s;land, a Place of difficult Acce&s;s, and more di&s;tant from the Danger of being &s;ur|prized: Flats were prepared to carry them off to &s;ome Place of Safety, in Ca&s;e the Rioters &s;hould put their rebellious Threats in Execution.&mdash;But the cold Weather

coming on, and the River being full of Ice, both the Government, which was then de&s;titute of any Mode of defending them, and the Indians them&s;elves, became unea&s;y at their Situation. This drew a Reque&s;t from them to be removed to Sir <HI>William John&s;on</HI>'s, and pre|vailed on the <HI>Governor</HI> to gratify them.

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> who were lately &s;eated by the Govern|ment on the <HI>Province I&s;land,</HI> were, at their own earne&s;t Reque&s;t, &s;ent off in a Body by me, under an E&s;cort, on the fifth In&s;tant, with an Intention of removing them, through the Governments of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> to Sir <HI>William John&s;on,</HI> to who&s;e Care and Protection, as they were not in a State of Security here, I recommended them.</P>
<P>I took the Precaution of acquainting the re&s;pective Governors of tho&s;e two Provinces with this Mea&s;ure, and reque&s;ted that they would be plea&s;ed to permit them to proceed unmole&s;ted, and furni&s;h them with Pa&s;&s;ports. The Governor of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> with great <HI>Politene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;s,</HI> complied with my Reque&s;t; but, to my great Surprize, I received a Letter Ye&s;terday from the Lieu|tenant-Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> acquainting me that
<PB N="39" REF="009892_0044_0F7AD59B63037488">
he, by the Advice of his Council, had forbid their Entrance into that Province. Being thus di&s;appointed, I am under the Nece&s;&s;ity of ordering tho&s;e poor Crea|tures to return again to this Government, and am <HI>heartily di&s;po&s;ed to do every Thing in my Power</HI> to afford them that <HI>Protection</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> which, under their Cir|cum&s;tances, they have an UNDOUBTED RIGHT <HI>to expect and claim from us,</HI> and &s;hall be glad of your Opinion and Advice in what Manner this can mo&s;t effectually be done. I have ordered the Secretary to lay before you Governor <HI>Colden</HI>'s Letter, a Copy of the Minutes of the Council Board of <HI>New-York</HI> on the Occa&s;ion, and a Letter I received from General <HI>Gage;</HI> the latter of which will &s;hew how much we are obliged to the General for the kind Part he has taken in this Matter.</P>

<P>WE have taken into our Con&s;ideration your Honour's Me&s;&s;age of the Sixteenth In&s;tant, with the Letters therein referred to, and are plea&s;ed to find the Governor &s;o heartily di&s;po&s;ed to afford the <HI>Indians</HI> he mentions
<Q>that Protection and Security which, under their Circum&s;tances, they have an undoubted Right to expect and claim from us.</Q>
We &s;hould be very glad, if it was in our Power,
<Q>to point out the Manner in which this can mo&s;t effectually be done;</Q>
but as our <HI>"Opinion"</HI> mu&s;t be founded on the Information we have received, we can only mention &s;uch Mea&s;ures as appear to us at pre&s;ent to be mo&s;t rea&s;onable; &s;ubmitting our Sentiments to the Judgment your Honour may form from any Intelligence you have &s;ince received, or any Circum&s;tances that may hereafter happen.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve, with particular Plea&s;ure,
<Q>the kind Part General <HI>Gage</HI> has taken in this Matter,</Q>
in protecting the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and directing the E&s;cort, on their Arrival in this City, to receive <HI>"&s;uch Orders as you &s;hall judge proper to give them.".</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="009892_0045_0F7AD59C08F42CE0">As this humane and prudent Step of the General is equally calculated to &s;ecure the&s;e unhappy People, and pre&s;erve the internal Peace of this Province, while our own Troops are engaged in the Defence of our Frontiers, we &s;hall be obliged to your Honour, if you will plea&s;e to return his <HI>EXCELLENCY OUR THANKS</HI> for this generous and &s;ea&s;onable Act of Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> we apprehend, will be &s;ufficiently protected by the Companies that compo&s;e this E&s;cort, while they remain here.&mdash;When the&s;e Companies march from hence, if there &s;hould appear to be the &s;ame Danger of any Outrage being committed again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> that there &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent, we are of Opinion, that it will be advi&s;eable for your Honour to lodge them in &s;ome Place where they can be mo&s;t ea&s;ily and conveniently guarded by an armed Force, to be rai&s;ed by your Honour for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It will be with the utmo&s;t Regret we &s;hall &s;ee your Honour reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing the&s;e Mea&s;ures; but with an Abhorrence altogether inexpre&s;&s;ible we &s;hould behold <HI>"the&s;e poor Creatures,"</HI> who, de&s;irous of living in Friend|&s;hip with us, as Proofs of this Di&s;po&s;ition quitting a Settle|ment that made them &s;u&s;pected, and &s;urrendering their Arms, have delivered them&s;elves, their Wives and Children, into our Power, on the Faith of this Province, barbarou&s;ly butchered by a Sett of Ruffians, who&s;e audacious Cruelty is checked by no Sentiment of Humanity, and by no Regard to the Laws of their Country.</P>
<P>Such a Ma&s;&s;acre we have Rea&s;on to expect from the Per|&s;ons who perpetrated &s;uch &s;hocking Barbarities in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> County, and their Abettors, unle&s;s they are deterred by a vigorous Exertion of Power, which never can be more pro|perly employed than in vindicating the Honour and Dignity of a Government, enforcing an Obedience to the Laws, and repre&s;&s;ing the dangerous In&s;olence of tumultuous In&s;urgents who, guided by a blind Rage, undertake by open Force to controul the Conduct of the Admini&s;tration, and counteract the be&s;t concerted Mea&s;ures for the general Good.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="009892_0046_0F7AD59D1FF82888">It will therefore be agreeable to us, that your Honour would be plea&s;ed to order the Sheriff and Coroner of <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter</HI> County, and the Magi&s;trates of that Borough, to come down, and give you the be&s;t Information that can be obtained of the Per&s;ons concerned in the&s;e Violences; that they being di&s;covered and apprehended, due Puni&s;hment may be inflicted on &s;uch daring Di&s;turbers of the public Peace.</P>

<P>Upon the Return of the Indians to this City, they remained under the Protection of the King's Troops; and the brave Citizens of Philadelphia of all Denominations (&s;ave the Engli&s;h, Scotch and Iri&s;h Pre&s;byterians) for|med them&s;elves into Companies, to &s;upport the Govern|ment and defend its Laws.</P>

<P>I Find great Difficulty in &s;ettling, on the Footing of Law, and on the Principles of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titu|tion, the Orders proper to be given to the Commanding Officer of the three Companies of <HI>Royal Americans,</HI> &s;ent here by General <HI>Gage,</HI> to &s;upport the civil Power, as Rules for his own Conduct and Government of the Soldiers, in Ca&s;e the <HI>Indians,</HI> now under their Protec|tion, &s;hould be attacked, and an Attempt made to <HI>murder</HI> them. At the &s;ame Time that I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the&s;e <HI>poor Creatures,</HI> by all the Means in my Power, I would not, in the Orders I give for that End, be guilty of the lea&s;t Infraction of the Laws. A Doubt has ari&s;en whether any Orders I can give to the regular Troops to make U&s;e of Force and Violence again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's Subjects, though riotou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled, with an Intent to kill the <HI>Indians,</HI> will be a legal Ju&s;ti|fication for their &s;hedding of Blood in oppo&s;ing and preventing the De&s;ign, till the civil Power has fir&s;t been

called in, and in vain endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s the Tumult.</P>
<P>IN &s;o tender and important a Ca&s;e, I would rather err on the cautious Side, and, to remove all Doubts, reque&s;t you will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider this Matter immedi|ately, and that, by a &s;hort Law, you will for a Time extend to this Province the Riot Act of the Fir&s;t of GEORGE the Fir&s;t, or make &s;uch other Provi&s;ion, to remove the pre&s;ent Difficulty, as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t proper.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE Statute for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Riots, was, agreeable to this Requi&s;ition, extended to this Province; and the Governor and his Council, in the <HI>greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> invited the People to &s;upport him, again&s;t the lawle&s;s Violence threatned by the&s;e Rebels, who&s;e Cau&s;e your Pen is pro&s;tituted to vindicate. The Governor him&s;elf appeared at the Head of the Citizens, and with the Advice of his Council, and the Provincial Commi&s;&s;ioners, conducted the Whole. Which of the&s;e Facts will you have the Bold|ne&s;s to deny? Surely not that which the General &s;o plainly declares in his Letter, That the Rea&s;on of his not permit|ting the Indians "to be abandon'd by the E&s;cort," was becau&s;e the <HI>Governor</HI>
<Q>had thought it advi&s;eable to put them under the Military."&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e, for Argu|ment &s;ake, this had been done "at the Reque&s;t of the Quakers,</Q>
was it not both prudent and humane?&mdash;You will an&s;wer me, I doubt not in the Negative; becau&s;e it was, and it &s;eems &s;till is your Opinion, that the Indians &s;hould be ma&s;&s;acred; or you could not take Offence at the only Mea&s;ure which &s;aved them from it. But will you con&s;ider a Moment, that General <HI>Gage</HI>'s Conduct was approved of by both <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> and they acknowledged them&s;elves under <HI>Obligations</HI> to him for it? &mdash;The Governor informs the A&s;&s;embly, that they will perceive by the General's Letter,
<Q>how much we are obliged to him for the kind Part he has taken in this Matter:</Q>
&mdash;And the A&s;&s;embly reque&s;ts the Governor
<Q><PB N="43" REF="009892_0048_0F7AD59F85C62640">will be plea&s;ed to return his Excellency their Thanks, for this generous and &s;ea&s;onable Act of Goodne&s;s.</Q>
And how indecent and fooli&s;h is it then in a few Clergymen, to undertake to cen&s;ure the Conduct of a whole Govern|ment, and of his Maje&s;ty's General, only becau&s;e it did not quadrate with their wicked and rebellious Sentiments, de&s;tructive of all Humanity, Allegiance and Order?</P>
<P>BUT as you have repeatedly endeavoured to have it thought, that none but <HI>Quakers</HI> or their Friends, have painted the Actions of the <HI>Paxton</HI> Rioters in a horrid Light, I &s;hall therefore give you an Extract of another Me&s;&s;age from the <HI>Governor,</HI> in which he expre&s;&s;es his Sentiments very &s;trongly with Regard to tho&s;e People.
<Q>I am &s;orry to inform you, &s;ays he, that the <HI>&s;ame Spirit</HI> and <HI>frantic Rage,</HI> which actuated tho&s;e who lately put to Death the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> County, &s;till prevails among them; and that in&s;tead of having any <HI>Remor&s;e</HI> for, or in the lea&s;t dreading the bad Con&s;equences of their Conduct, I have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to believe they are daily &s;trengthning their Party, and adding greatly to their Numbers, and threaten to come down armed in a Body, and repeat the &s;ame <HI>Acts of Cruelty</HI> on the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Barracks, in the <HI>Northern Liberties</HI> of this City, determined to <HI>&s;pare none</HI> who oppo&s;e their <HI>wicked</HI> De&s;igns. They have already given <HI>abundant Proof,</HI> that neither <HI>Religion, Humanity</HI> or <HI>Laws,</HI> are Objects of <HI>their</HI> Con&s;ideration, or of <HI>&s;ufficient Weight</HI> to <HI>re&s;train</HI> them.</Q></P>
<P>I THINK, Reverend Sirs, you will hardly &s;ay that the&s;e Sentiments were dictated by a <HI>Quaker</HI> Faction; for among all the Faults you may find with this Gentleman's Admi|ni&s;tration, you cannot &s;urely charge him with any Parti|ality to <HI>Quakers,</HI> whatever you may do to <HI>others.</HI> 'Tis however more than probable, that his H&mdash;r's <HI>Language</HI> is &s;ince <HI>altered</HI> with re&s;pect to tho&s;e Murderers, but it is impo&s;&s;ible that his <HI>Sentiments</HI> &s;hould. Whence this <HI>Alte|ration</HI> aro&s;e is in your Power to unfold, and you may
<PB N="44" REF="009892_0049_0F7AD5A01AB14468">
po&s;&s;ibly flatter your&s;elves, that no one el&s;e is enabled to do it: I have, notwith&s;tanding great Rea&s;on to expect that it will not be long before you are fully convinced to the contrary.</P>
<P>DETERMINED to depre&s;s and abu&s;e the Quakers, and to excu&s;e the Rioters, you are plea&s;ed to add what you &s;ay, were the Declarations of the latter,&mdash;
<Q>The&s;e In&s;urgents (&s;ay you) declared that they were <HI>Loyal Subjects,</HI> and would not do what <HI>looked like Rebellion,</HI> tho' they thought it exceeding hard that they &s;hould be obliged to pay Taxes to maintain their Enemies.</Q>
With what View did you mention this Declaration?&mdash;Was it from any fooli&s;h Hope you had, that you could per&s;uade Mankind to credit the A&s;&s;ertions of Men, who&s;e Actions had been, and were at the very Time flatly contradictory.&mdash;Your moral Philo&s;ophy mu&s;t tell you, that Actions are more evidently indicative of the Mind than Words.&mdash;Some of tho&s;e Rioters were the Men that had committed the Murders at <HI>Cone&s;togoe</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter.,</HI> contrary to the Faith of the Government, the Laws of the Country, and the Gover|nor's Proclamation. Pu&s;hed on by the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt, and a Dread of Puni&s;hment, mixed with an enthu|&s;ia&s;tic Rage and Hatred again&s;t all Indians, they re&s;olved to take up Arms again&s;t the Government it&s;elf, prevailed with others to join them, with a View to encrea&s;e the Number of Offenders, &s;o much as to render it dangerous or difficult to bring them to ju&s;tice.&mdash;With this View they came down to <HI>Germantown,</HI> and from thence &s;ent out their Spies to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to ob&s;erve the Conduct and Preparations of the Government again&s;t them, con|tinually publi&s;hing their Re&s;olution to de&s;troy the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>all that defended them;</HI> nor was the <HI>Governor</HI> him&s;elf free from their <HI>Menaces.</HI> And do you &s;eriou&s;ly think, Reverend Sirs, that the breaking of Goals and murdering of Indians under the immediate Protection of the Go|vernment, in Defiance of its Proclamations and its Laws, does not <HI>"look like Rebellion,"</HI> and that the Conduct of
<PB N="45" REF="009892_0050_0F7AD5A0D58A1190">
the&s;e Rioters in endeavouring to pro&s;ecute their Murders were Proofs of their Loyalty?&mdash;That they ought not to &s;ubmit to the Laws of the Land, but had a Right to trample on all Laws, both Humane and Divine? If you do not, how could you without the highe&s;t Remor&s;e, offer a Syllable in Vindication of &s;uch Rebels again&s;t their King, their Country and their God?</P>
<P>HAVING thus by plain and authentic Evidence refuted all your malignant Slanders again&s;t a People who&s;e Conduct in Life has been ever attended with the highe&s;t <HI>Re&s;pect for Government,</HI> and the <HI>true&s;t Loyalty</HI> to their KING, who&s;e <HI>publick Spirit</HI> has equalled their Loyalty, and who&s;e <HI>Benevolence and Charity</HI> to Mankind in gene|ral has not fallen &s;hort of any one Sect in the World; I &s;hall conclude this Addre&s;s to you, with a few &s;erious Remarks on your Conduct, in Hopes of prevailing on you to alter it in future, and to amend your Hearts.</P>
<P>To traduce the private Character of an Individual, is an Offence which every moral Man would blu&s;h at being charged with. And to a&s;per&s;e the publick Reputation of a whole Society, to accu&s;e them of Crimes of the mo&s;t atrocious Nature, puni&s;hable with Death it&s;elf, without the lea&s;t Foundation, and to publi&s;h the Accu&s;ation throughout the World in a publick News-paper, is an Offence &s;o much more aggravated, that every good Mind mu&s;t be &s;truck with Abhorrence at the Thought of it. Surely on a Moment's Reflection you mu&s;t acknowledge, that it is contrary to the Duty of a good Member of Socie|ty, with the Principles of Morality, and highly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Precepts of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel.</HI> It is an Offence that ill becomes any Man, but much more &s;o tho&s;e that have entrered into the &s;acred and awful Engagements of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and publickly profe&s;s to be his Apo&s;tles. Mu&s;t it not then give your Friends and Hearers, who rely on you for Guidance in the Paths of Religion, great Contempt for your Doctrines, and afflict
<PB N="46" REF="009892_0051_0F7AD5A149A281C8">
them with the deepe&s;t <HI>Sorrow,</HI> to find that you are Men who have been guilty of the Crime I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Is it wonderful, then,
<Q>that you have been able to do <HI>Nothing</HI> (as you ob&s;erve) to &s;pread the Go&s;pel either among the <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Europeans?</HI></Q>
Have you taken even a probable Method of promoting the Truths of the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel?&mdash; It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by a great and good Divine, that Per&s;ons in your Offices have Occa&s;ion for their whole Time, to employ it
<Q>in Study, Labour, and the Performance of their Duty, and that all the Powers of Humane Nature are &s;carcely &s;uffi|cient to di&s;charge it fully.</Q>
I make a &s;olemn Appeal to your own Con&s;ciences: Have your Actions of late, di&s;covered any Sen&s;e of this Truth; to you an important Truth? Have you not, in&s;tead of endeavouring to &s;pread the Go&s;pel, and laying out your Talent in a profitable Merchandize, been entering into the Intrigues of the World, and the Hurry of Politics? Has not your Time been engro&s;&s;ed in the Works of Ambition, in paying court to the Great, and in learning and executing their wicked Artifices? Has it not been employed in the Invention of Fal&s;ehoods, to calumniate a religious Society of People, who have been long the Objects of your Envy and Hatred? Has it not been employed in forming the mo&s;t vile Untruths, to cover the mo&s;t horrid Crimes, and to re&s;cue from Puni&s;hment, Rebels again&s;t the Government, and the Murderers of the Innocent un|der it's Protection? Has it not been employed in promot|ing Party Feuds and irreconcileable Di&s;cord among the People? In writing, and encouraging the writing of fal&s;e and infamous Libels, dectructive of the Reputation of your hone&s;t Neighbours, which to them is more valuable than Life? Have you not &s;ubmitted your Judgments and Con&s;ciences to the Direction of the Proprietary Poli|ticians, and bu&s;ied your&s;elves in rendering the immediate Government of your Sovereign odious and dete&s;table to his hone&s;t and faithful Subjects? Have you not wrote
<PB N="47" REF="009892_0052_0F7AD5A218764C70">
your <HI>Circular Letters,</HI> and &s;ent your Emi&s;&s;aries throughout the Province, repre&s;enting a <HI>Royal</HI> Government, as oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical? Have you not for this very Purpo&s;e, pro&s;tituted your Churches and Hou&s;es, erected alone for the Wor&s;hip of God, to hold your dirty Cabals, and to lay your Plans for carrying into Execu|tion the Schemes of your Political Matters? The&s;e Things have eradicated from your Hearts, that <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> Meekne&s;s and Simplicity, which eveir di&s;tingui&s;hed the Conduct of our Divine In&s;tructor, and which ever mu&s;t be the chief Ornament of his true Mini&s;ters. You have left the Paths of Virtue, and become Pro|moters of Vice; you have exchanged <HI>true Religion</HI> for <HI>deceitful Politicks;</HI> for as you have u&s;ed them they may be ju&s;tly defin'd, <HI>Ars non tam regendi quam fallendi hominem.</HI> You have exchanged Brotherly <HI>Love, Peace</HI> and <HI>Good|will</HI> towards your Neighbours, for <HI>Envy, Malice</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;ehood.</HI> In fine, was I to &s;earch the Defects of human Nature through, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find any Thing more incon&s;i&s;tent with the Principles of Chri&s;tianity, than the whole of your late Conduct. Could you expect then that the divine Author of all Goodne&s;s, Virtue, Meek|ne&s;s, Charity and univer&s;al Benevolence, would ble&s;s the feeble and in&s;incere Endeavours of &s;uch, In&s;truments? If the&s;e divine Truths, or the Spirit of the Author of all true Religion, ever touched your Hearts, be exhorted to turn from the Evil of your Ways, like the prodigal Son, and repent in Du&s;t and A&s;hes, that you may find Accep|tance; for you cannot "&s;erve <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Mammon</HI> too."</P>
