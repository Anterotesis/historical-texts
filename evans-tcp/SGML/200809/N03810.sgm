</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE due government of the tongue is a matter of much greater importance in religion, than men are commonly apt to imagine. They are too ready to &s;ay, with tho&s;e, in old time, at lea&s;t in their practice,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xii. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</HI> But let men &s;ay what they will, their tongues are under the Divine government; and much of their duty lies, in keeping them within tho&s;e re&s;traints, it has plea&s;ed GOD to lay upon them: Nay, &s;o <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> a branch of <HI>true chri&s;tia|nity</HI> is this, that if they <HI>bridle not their tongue,</HI> tho' they &s;hould <HI>&s;eem to be religious,</HI> they are not &s;o in <HI>reality;</HI> yea, all their pretences to religion are <HI>vain.</HI> So the
<PB N="6" REF="004689_0004_100DB9828BF61E58">
in&s;pir'd apo&s;tle, with great peremptorine&s;s, declares in the text. <HI>If any man among you &s;eem to be religious, and bri|dleth not his tongue;&mdash;this man's religion is vain:</HI> In which words, there are two things worthy our awaken'd attention; the one &s;uppo&s;ed, the other expre&s;s'd.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The thing &s;uppo&s;ed is, that per&s;ons may <HI>&s;eem to be religious,</HI> while yet, <HI>they have, in reality, no true religion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The thing expre&s;s'd is, that tho&s;e, who <HI>bridle not their tongue, have no other than a meer &s;eeming religion, which will prove vain.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. The fir&s;t thing that offers to con&s;ideration from the text is, that per&s;ons may <HI>&s;eems to be religious, while yet, they have, in reality, no true religion.</HI> So &s;peaks the apo&s;tle, <HI>If any man among you &s;eem to be religious.</HI> i. e. only &s;eemeth to be &s;o; &s;eemeth to be &s;o, while yet, he is not really &s;o. 'Tis obviou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, there may be the &s;hew and appearance, without the reality of religion: Nor is this &s;uppo&s;eable only; 'tis too often the ca&s;e in fact.</P>
<P>It was &s;o in the times of CHRIST, and his <HI>apo&s;tles.</HI> The <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> in that day, <HI>&s;eem'd</HI> to be religious; yea, &s;o &s;anctified was their external appear|ance, that they were held in veneration, as men of &s;u|perior piety. They were indeed univer&s;ally e&s;teemed as the be&s;t and holie&s;t of men: in&s;omuch, that it became a common Saying among the Jews, <HI>if but two men went to heaven, a Phari&s;ee would be one of them.</HI> And yet, by the account, our SAVIOUR him&s;elf gives of them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. Matth.</HI> 23. <HI>cap.</HI></NOTE> they were evidently void of all real and &s;ub|&s;tantial goodne&s;s. The &s;hew they made of being &s;o ve|ry religious, was nothing more than meer pretence. They were ba&s;e hypocrites; <HI>righteous</HI> in their <HI>outward
<PB N="7" REF="004689_0005_100DB98416593CB8">
appearance,</HI> but <HI>within full of iniquity; beautiful without, like whited &s;epulchres,</HI> but <HI>within full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Judas,</HI> the traitor, no doubt, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to be, was in &s;hew and appearance, as religious as any of the <HI>Twelve;</HI> his di&s;cour&s;e as full of CHRIST; his zeal as flaming again&s;t &s;in; his attendance on the &s;ermons of our LORD, as frequent and &s;erious; his partaking of the holy &s;acrament, as reverent and devout, and with as much outward love and affection. He was indeed as well tho't of as any of the apo&s;tles: To be &s;ure, they them&s;elves had as good an opinion of him, as of any of their Number, and not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his being a bad man; while yet, he was, all this time, a rotten-hearted, vile hypocrite. The &s;in of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> reign|ed in him; and at la&s;t, under the influence of the <HI>Devil,</HI> increa&s;ed to &s;uch a mon&s;trous heigth, that he even <HI>be|trayed</HI> and <HI>&s;old</HI> his MASTER and SAVIOUR, for the pi|tiful &s;um of <HI>thirty pieces of &s;ilver.</HI></P>
<P>It is, by no means, to be imagined, as if all that <HI>&s;eem to be religious,</HI> really were &s;o. There always have been, and there is no rea&s;on to think but there always will be, ba&s;e hypocrites, among the pretenders to &s;e|rious godline&s;s; per&s;ons, who will appear in the gui&s;e of &s;aints, talk as they do, and behave as they do, as to what is outward and open to the view of others; while yet, they are not the men they <HI>&s;eem to be,</HI> and would make the world believe them to be.</P>
<P>It may not indeed be thus &s;aid of <HI>particular per|&s;ons.</HI> It would be to judge ra&s;hly and cen&s;oriou&s;ly, &s;o much as to &s;u&s;pect them of hypocri&s;y, unle&s;s by one way or other, they have made it evident, they are not in <HI>reality,</HI> what they are in <HI>pretence.</HI> But this notwith&s;tanding, it is a truth, and may, in con&s;i&s;tence with true charity, be pronounced, in the
<PB N="8" REF="004689_0006_100DB987322FFA08">
<HI>general,</HI> as &s;uch, that there are hypocrites among chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors; meer pretenders to real godline&s;s, among tho&s;e who <HI>&s;eem to be</HI> mighty <HI>religious.</HI> O how many, who have made a <HI>fals &s;hew in the fle&s;h,</HI> have been left of GOD to di&s;cover their <HI>hypocri&s;y,</HI> by living in tho&s;e &s;ins, which are incon&s;i&s;tent with an hone&s;t heart! Thus it has been all along from the days of CHRIST, and thus it is at <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI>&mdash;Multitudes will be condemned, at the great and la&s;t judgment, for their hypocri&s;y; for their <HI>&s;eeming to be religious,</HI> while they had really no religion at all. For that is the language in which our SAVIOUR him&s;elf has told us, he will be&s;peak <HI>many great preten|ders to religion,</HI> in the day of his appearing to judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>If any &s;hould now enquire, into the rea&s;ons of this conduct, how it comes about, that men &s;hould <HI>&s;eem to be religious, when, at the &s;ame time, they have no religion at all;</HI> The an&s;wer is as follows,</P>
<P>They may make this appearance in religion, to gain the <HI>commendation</HI> and <HI>applau&s;e</HI> of <HI>others.</HI> This lay at the bottom, as the grand incentive to all that external &s;hew of religion, which the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> in our SAVIOUR's time, were famous for; and by which they procured to them&s;elves a glorious reputation, as men of the mo&s;t exalted &s;anctity. Every thing they did in religion, whether it was <HI>keeping fa&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>putting</HI> up <HI>prayers</HI> to almighty GOD, or <HI>giving alms</HI> to the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Matth. 6. the five fir&s;t ver&s;es.</NOTE>; Every thing, I &s;ay, was with a view to men, to have their prai&s;e and commendation: So our SAVIOUR has him&s;elf determined upon this matter, in tho&s;e expre&s;s words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 23. 5.</NOTE> <HI>But all their works they do to be &s;een of men.</HI> And others, no doubt, are of the &s;ame Spirit with
<PB N="9" REF="004689_0007_100DB989F8876B98">
the&s;e <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> They affect a reputation for piety; and are very &s;pecious in their religious pre|tences, hoping they &s;hall herefrom be applauded, as per|&s;ons of higher attainments than ordinary in chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>They may al&s;o make <HI>this &s;hew of being religious, the better to compa&s;s their worldly de&s;igns.</HI> This was another motive, to all the &s;anctimonious pretences of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> according to that of our SAVIOUR, Matt. xxiii. 14, where they are repre&s;ented, <HI>as devouring widows hou&s;es; and for a pretence, making long prayers.</HI> And thus, without que&s;tion, 'tis with many at pre&s;ent. They <HI>&s;eem to be religious,</HI> and their view is, to &s;erve them&s;elves. They have no inward regard to GOD, or holine&s;s, but appear as if they had; and all, that they may be the better tru&s;ted, the more readily imployed, the more bountifully relieved; or otherwi&s;e, that they may not be &s;o &s;oon &s;u&s;pected of any bad de&s;ign, and may be under an advantage to carry it on, beyond what they would have been, if they had not made this &s;hew, but appeared <HI>outwardly</HI> as they were <HI>inwardly.</HI> The&s;e are the views of too many in their pretences to religion. With the&s;e views they at fir&s;t put on a cloak of god|line&s;s; and with the &s;ame views, they have kept it on ever &s;ince. They make u&s;e of religion only to pro|mote their own intere&s;t; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, whenever their intere&s;t calls for it, they will lay it a&s;ide, as u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>natural con&s;cience</HI> may put per&s;ons upon doing &s;uch things, as will make them <HI>&s;eem to be religious.</HI> Some, perhaps, have con&s;ciences that won't &s;uffer them to be without &s;omething, that looks like religion. They are forc'd, it may be, for the ea&s;e of their minds, to ab&s;tain from the gro&s;&s;er acts of &s;in, to pray to almighty GOD, to attend upon the external duties of religion, and to live after &s;uch a manner, as that
<PB N="10" REF="004689_0008_100DB98B85363E68">
their appearance is like the appearance of the righteous. A great many per&s;ons would not have been at the pains of only <HI>&s;eeming to be religious,</HI> if they could have helpt it: But their con&s;ciences have put them upon this; not allowing them to be in quiet, without &s;omething of the <HI>form of godline&s;s.</HI>&mdash;But it is not my de&s;ign to enlarge on this fir&s;t ob&s;ervation: Only before I pro|ceed,</P>
<P>Let me caution you, not to be <HI>prejudiced again&s;t religion,</HI> becau&s;e there are tho&s;e, who <HI>&s;eem to be religious,</HI> but are not <HI>really &s;o.</HI> There is danger, I am &s;en&s;ible, lea&s;t this &s;hould be a <HI>&s;tone of &s;tumbling:</HI> which, to prevent, our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR has been plea&s;ed parti|cularly to <HI>forewarn us,</HI> that <HI>thus it would be.</HI> He has not only told us of tares among the <HI>wheat;</HI> but &s;olemnly publi&s;hed it to be his intention <HI>thus to &s;uffer it to be,</HI> till the <HI>time of the harve&s;t:</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 13. 30.</NOTE>: Yea further, he has very expre&s;ly foretold the coming on of a &s;tate of things, under the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation, in which, there &s;hould be much <HI>&s;eeming religion,</HI> without any <HI>reality;</HI> yea, in which, under the ma&s;k of a goodly profe&s;&s;ion, there &s;hould be that wickedne&s;s practi&s;ed, which would be a reproach to the chri&s;tian name. To this purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words, &s;poken under the in&s;piration of the SPIRIT of JESUS CHRIST,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3. begin.</NOTE> <HI>This know al&s;o, that, in the</HI> LAST DAYS, <HI>perillous times &s;hall come. For men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phe|mers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</HI>&mdash;<HI>fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good,</HI>&mdash;<HI>heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;erveable, all this wickedne&s;s is here prophe&s;ied of, as what &s;hould be acted by per|&s;ons, <HI>making a profe&s;&s;ion of religion.</HI> For tho&s;e are the
<PB N="11" REF="004689_0009_100D865B5A0B4068">
words, which clo&s;e this prophetic awful de&s;cription, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF. You have no rea&s;on, then, to be &s;tumbled at the <HI>hypocri&s;y</HI> of tho&s;e, who make pre|tences to religion, when they really have none. This is no more than might be lookt for.&mdash;'Tis rather an argument for, than an exception again&s;t the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> religion.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me likewi&s;e, caution you again&s;t this religion, which is a <HI>&s;eeming one only,</HI> and not <HI>real.</HI> And here con&s;ider,</P>
<P>'Twill never recommend you to the <HI>favour</HI> of GOD. For he looketh not to the outward appearance, but the heart. And your very hearts are as open to his view, as your <HI>faces</HI> are to the view of men. He &s;ees into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of your &s;ouls; and if iniquity is there, he will certainly &s;py it out. You may, by your pretences, impo&s;e upon men; but you can't deceive the <HI>heart-&s;earching</HI> GOD. A meer <HI>&s;eeming</HI> religion won't recommend you to him. If your hearts are leavened with hypocri&s;y, though you are ever &s;o <HI>beau|tiful outward,</HI> you will be odious in his &s;ight, as a <HI>&s;epulchre full of rottenne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this <HI>meer &s;eeming religion</HI> will be in&s;ufficient to recommend you to the <HI>good opinion of men.</HI> You may indeed, for a time, impo&s;e upon them; you may, by a &s;pecious out&s;ide appearance, lead them into a thought of you, as per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;ht piety: But you won't be able to maintain your character long. It will be a wonder, if your hypocri&s;y don't, &s;ome way or other, di&s;cover it&s;elf. Few have been able, for any con|&s;iderable time, to wear the habit of religion, with the character of being religious, while their hearts have been <HI>full of iniquity and hypocri&s;y.</HI> You may have rea&s;on to fear, GOD will leave you to your &s;elves, to
<PB N="12" REF="004689_0010_100DB98D4C096008">
the power of your own hearts lu&s;ts; and then, you will &s;oon di&s;cover your &s;elves, and let it be known, notwith&s;tanding the pompous appearance you have made, that you were &s;inners, and have all along acted a part, making the world believe otherwi&s;e of you, than you really were. And when this comes to be the ca&s;e, what will be the <HI>good opinion,</HI> they will have of you? If ever they thought well of you, they will now change their &s;entiments, and look upon you as <HI>ba&s;e hypocrites,</HI> than which a more odious character can't be given you. They will think wor&s;e of you, than if you had appeared without di&s;gui&s;e; and will not ea&s;ily, after this, be brought to treat you any other|wi&s;e than as deceivers and impo&s;tors.&mdash;</P>
<P>But if you are yet unmoved, O turn your thoughts to the bar of the coming judgment, and reflect, &s;eri|ou&s;ly reflect, on what will then be the awful doom of all tho&s;e, who <HI>only &s;eem to be religious.</HI> They &s;hall be &s;ent away <HI>to dwell with devouring fire;</HI> yea, they &s;hall dwell in the hotte&s;t place of that <HI>lake, which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone.</HI>&mdash;Wo unto you hypocrites, for ye &s;hall <HI>receive the greate&s;t damnation!</HI> You are mark't out for it, by name, in the <HI>revelations</HI> of GOD!&mdash;O con&s;ider of this in time; and go not on mocking GOD, and deceiving the world, lea&s;t he <HI>cut you a&s;under, and appoint you your portion,</HI> where <HI>&s;hall be weeping and gna&s;h|ing of teeth.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I now go on to the other thing we ob&s;erv'd from the text; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>II. That tho&s;e, who <HI>bridle not their tongue,</HI> are per|&s;ons, who have <HI>no other than a meer &s;eeming religion, which is vain.</HI></P>

Of multi|tudes it may be &s;aid, they give their tongues an uncon|&s;cionable liberty! O the &s;warms of prophane &s;wearers! of filthy talkers! of liars! of evil &s;peakers! of cen&s;ori|ous judgers! of idle bablers! And what makes the matter wor&s;e, are there not to be found the&s;e &s;inners, among the profe&s;&s;ors of religion? Among tho&s;e, who make a mo&s;t &s;plended appearance, of being righteous? It &s;hould greatly affect our hearts; &amp; the rather, becau&s;e the&s;e per&s;ons deceive them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t others, with that which is wor&s;e than nothing and vanity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us <HI>look each one to his tongue, and examine,</HI> whether it be an <HI>unbridled one.</HI> And this, whatever we may think of it, is a matter of no &s;mall importance. We may imagine, religion has little or nothing to do with our tongues; but we are mightily mi&s;taken. It has &s;o much to do with them, that if we <HI>don't bridle them,</HI> there is not a <HI>more certain mark</HI> of our being de&s;titute of the reality of religion; that it is a <HI>mere &s;ee|ming one;</HI> which will, in the end, prove <HI>vain,</HI> let us pretend what we will. Let us then examine how it is with our tongues. Do we keep them under goverment, or allow them to move at random? Do we re&s;train them within chri&s;tian bounds, or give them a univer&s;al latitude? Do we make con&s;cience of what we &s;peak, or e&s;teem it a matter of indifference? Do we &s;et a watch at the door of our lips, or &s;peak without guard or caution? 'Tis worth our enquiry, how we manage our tongues: Whether we keep them, as it were, with bit and bridle, or &s;uffer them to go as they plea&s;e. We may know much of our &s;tate GOD-WARD,
<PB N="26" REF="004689_0024_100DB9AE41A82220">
by the conduct of our tongues, If we &s;o govern them as not to offend in any great or gro&s;s in&s;tances, we have made con&s;iderable attainments in religion: Whereas if we take no care to keep them within due limits, we may lay it down for an indi&s;puted truth, that we have no true religion, be our profe&s;&s;ions as &s;olemn as they will.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us all be exhorted to a care to <HI>bridle our tongues.</HI> And we have the more need to make u&s;e of caution in this matter, becau&s;e the tongue is &s;o unruly a member. The apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> treating upon this &s;ub|ject, repre&s;ents it as a very difficult thing to keep the tongue under a proper regimen. Says he, in the third chapter of his <HI>epi&s;tle,</HI> 7th and 8th Ver&s;es, <HI>Every kind of bea&s;ts, and of birds, and of &s;erpents, and things in the &s;ea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind; but the tongue can no man tame: It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poi&s;on.</HI> When the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of the tongue, as what <HI>no man can tame,</HI> he is to be under&s;tood, not according to the rigor of the <HI>letter,</HI> but in a <HI>qualified</HI> &s;en&s;e; as exhibiting only the difficulty of the thing: For that it is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary to our being good chri&s;tians, this &s;ame apo&s;tle plainly enough intimates, when he compares the government of the tongue, to the <HI>putting bits in the hor&s;es mouths, that they may obey us;</HI> as al&s;o, when he calls upon us to <HI>behold the &s;hips,</HI> which, tho' they <HI>be &s;o great, and are driven of fierce winds, are yet turned about with a &s;mall helm, whither&s;oever the governour li&s;teth.</HI></P>
<P>The due government of the tongue is then po&s;&s;ible, tho' a matter attended with difficulty: But let us not di&s;courage our &s;elves from any difficulties we may &s;up|po&s;e in this regimen. If there are difficulties, they may be overcome; and what is more, they mu&s;t be over|come. And in a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, there is no room
<PB N="27" REF="004689_0025_100DB9B12974AFA8">
for di&s;pute. Let us then, re&s;olve upon <HI>bridling our tongues.</HI> And the greater difficulty there may be in this, the greater pains let us take; always remem|bring our own weakne&s;s, and &s;uitably depending on GOD, for the&s;e aids of his SPIRIT, which are needful for us. And here let me, for your help in the <HI>govern|ment</HI> of your <HI>tongues,</HI> leave with you the following words of advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. Look <HI>to your hearts,</HI> and &s;ee to it, that they be <HI>good.</HI> This I mention fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is of the fir&s;t im|portance. For if our hearts are bad, 'twill be to little purpo&s;e to endeavour, to make our tongues good. We may, for a while, put on the <HI>hypocrite,</HI> and &s;peak as be|cometh &s;aints; but 'twill be a forc'd bu&s;ine&s;s, and not of any long continuance. It cannot, in nature, be ex|pected, but that our words &s;hould partake of the tem|per and bent of our minds. If they are worldly, our di&s;cour&s;e will be about the world; if they are proud, we &s;hall &s;peak in high &s;welling words of vanity; if they are carnal, our talk will be of the fle&s;h. 'Tis natural it &s;hould be thus, and cannot be otherwi&s;e. If there|fore we would &s;o manage the matter, as that our <HI>com|munication</HI> may be to the <HI>u&s;e of edifying,</HI> we mu&s;t begin with our <HI>hearts,</HI> and take care that they be &s;uitably im|pre&s;s'd with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of things <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eter|nal.</HI> If we would &s;peak of GOD with a becoming &s;o|lemnity, we mu&s;t get po&s;&s;e&s;t of an inward fear and dread of his infinite Maje&s;ty. If we would &s;peak &s;ui|tably of the un&s;een things of the other world, we mu&s;t look to it, that we feel within our&s;elves the awful weight and importance of the&s;e matters. In a word, a <HI>&s;ancti|fied heart</HI> is the be&s;t preparative for a well <HI>governed tongue.</HI> Get your hearts <HI>&s;ea&s;oned with grace,</HI> and you will then be under one of the be&s;t advantages in order to re&s;train your tongues.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="004689_0026_100DB9B2B044E730">
2. You would do well to be <HI>cautious</HI> and <HI>deliberate</HI> in what you &s;ay. You mu&s;t think before you &s;peak, not &s;uffering your tongues to run at random. <HI>Be not ra&s;h with thy mouth,</HI> is proper advice at all times, as well as when you take upon you to &s;peak unto GOD. Hence that &s;aying of the wi&s;e man, <HI>&s;ee&s;t thou a man ha&s;ty in his words, there is more hope of a fool than of him</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 29. 20.</NOTE>. 'Tis not to be expected there &s;hould be a ju&s;t decorum in your language, if you are ra&s;h to &s;peak.&mdash;The tongue is not to be govern'd, but where men take time, and utter them&s;elves, not heedle&s;ly and at all adventures, but with thought and deliberation.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould <HI>govern your pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> The&s;e ea&s;ily move the tongue: And if your pa&s;&s;ions a'nt kept under due re&s;traint, neither will your tongues. Be upon your guard therefore, that your pa&s;&s;ions don't break loo&s;e; and the rather, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the irre|gularities of the tongue take ri&s;e from the pa&s;&s;ions. Where there is hatred, there will be clamour and evil &s;peaking; where there is wrath and anger, there will be ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;ionate language.&mdash;If you neglect your pa&s;&s;ions, 'twill be a vain thing to attempt to <HI>bridle your tongues;</HI> whereas a due re&s;traint upon the former will have a mighty tendency to re&s;train the latter.</P>
<P N="4">4. You mu&s;t <HI>watch over your tongues.</HI> The re&s;olution of holy <HI>David</HI> mu&s;t be yours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 39. 1.</NOTE>, <HI>I will take heed to my ways, that I &s;in not with my tongue.</HI> And you mu&s;t ever be in the u&s;e of this heedfulne&s;s, guarding the door of your lips: And your watch &s;hould be &s;o &s;trict, that nothing, if po&s;&s;ible, may &s;lip from your tongues that is ami&s;s: E&s;pecially &s;hould you watch again&s;t tho&s;e inde|cencies of &s;peech, you are mo&s;t incident to. Some &s;ins of the tongue are, as it were, <HI>our own;</HI> they mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;ily be&s;et us,</HI> we are mo&s;t apt to fall into them. You &s;hould
<PB N="29" REF="004689_0027_100DB9B4696CD7D8">
&s;tudy where your danger lies mo&s;t, and there place the &s;tricte&s;t guard. Are you prone to <HI>talk idly?</HI> Watch over your words that they be to &s;ome valuable purpo&s;e. Are you apt to make too free with <HI>truth?</HI> Take heed that you &s;peak only the <HI>words of &s;oberne&s;s.</HI> And &s;o whatever the fault be, you are mo&s;t apt to run into, in your language, here &s;et up your re&s;olution, and be parti|cularly exact in your watch.</P>
<P N="5">5. It might be to good purpo&s;e, to be frequent in <HI>cal|ling your &s;elves to account for your words.</HI> The&s;e, you &s;hould make the &s;ubject of your &s;erious and religious examination: Nor &s;hould it be an uncommon thing with you to bring your tongues to the rule of GOD's word, and inquire how far they have been govern'd by it. And the oftener you examine into your words, the better. If you made it your daily practi&s;e to call over your conver&s;ation, and to judge and condemn it, where|in it has been beyond the bounds of what is fit and right, it might have a powerful tendency to keep your tongues under all chri&s;tian re&s;traints.</P>
<P N="6">6. You mu&s;t not forget to <HI>be much in prayer to God.</HI> Daily commit the cu&s;tody of your tongues to him: And this you will find to be one of the be&s;t expedients, in order to your keeping them under tho&s;e re&s;traints, which are nece&s;&s;ary. Be &s;en&s;ible of your own <HI>impotency,</HI> that you are not <HI>&s;ufficient, as of your&s;elves,</HI> to manage your tongues; but that <HI>your &s;ufficiency is of</HI> GOD. And be|ing thorowly convinced of this, O lift up your cry to the GOD <HI>who dwelleth</HI> on high, to &s;end you help from his holy habitation. O bow your knee to the God and FATHER of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> be&s;eeching him for his mercies &s;ake, to pre&s;erve you from tho&s;e <HI>&s;ins of &s;peech</HI> which will &s;poil your religion, making it a <HI>meer &s;eeming one,</HI> which is <HI>vain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="004689_0028_100DB9B7F3DBC5A8">
Not that you may lay a&s;ide all care, as tho' you had nothing to do <HI>your &s;elves:</HI> No, but in the way of doing every thing that lies within your &s;phere, you mu&s;t <HI>tru&s;t in GOD,</HI> and <HI>make your prayer to him,</HI> that he would <HI>keep your tongue from evil.</HI> The holy <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> has &s;et you a noble example of prayer in this kind. Let his <HI>prayer</HI> be yours,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 141. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Set a watch, O</HI> LORD, <HI>before my mouth: keep the door of my lips.</HI></P>
<P>And now, as the conclu&s;ion of all, let us not &s;atisfy our &s;elves with &s;o governing our tongues, as not to &s;uf|fer them to run into exce&s;s; but let us u&s;e them to the purpo&s;e of <HI>chri&s;tian conver&s;ation.</HI> Let our <HI>&s;peech be with grace, &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt.</HI>&mdash;Let us conver&s;e to|gether about the affairs of religion and another world. We &s;hall do &s;o, if we are <HI>real chri&s;tians:</HI> we &s;hall be known to be the di&s;ciples of JESUS, by our often &s;peaking of the <HI>things of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and the kingdom of</HI> CHRIST. Only, let us remember, the be&s;t chri&s;tians are the mo&s;t mode&s;t, the lea&s;t o&s;tentatious; and will rather refrain from <HI>religious talk,</HI> than &s;eem vain-glorious.&mdash;Let us therefore, while we mix religion with our di&s;|cour&s;e, take care to do it with a becoming prudence and humility: And under the habitual influence of this caution, the more we conver&s;e together about the con|cerns of our &s;ouls and everla&s;ting &s;alvation, the better: Nor can we too often bring religion into our common and ordinary conver&s;ation: Always provided, our lives are <HI>holy</HI> in proportion to the <HI>holine&s;s</HI> of our talk, for nothing is more odious than religious di&s;cour&s;e from a bad man.</P>
<P>May <HI>the words of our mouth,</HI> as well as <HI>the medita|tion of our heart, be acceptable in thy &s;ight, O</HI> LORD, <HI>our &s;trength and our Redeemer.</HI> Amen.</P>
