<P>THESE are the words of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, which he &s;pake to NICODEMUS, a ruler of the Jews. We have an account in the fir&s;t part of this chapter, of his coming to Chri&s;t by night, and he &s;eemed to be convinc'd by the miracles which Chri&s;t wrought of his being a teacher come from God for he &s;aid unto him "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do the&s;e miracles that thou do&s;t, except God be with him"; Je&s;us immediately goes to preaching to him the nece&s;&s;ity of the NEW BIRTH, which Nicodemus &s;eemed to be altogather ignorant about? Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God. This was &s;trange doctrine to Nicodemus, he did not di&s;tingui&s;h between a being born of the fle&s;h, and of the &s;pirit; and therefore &s;aith, how can the&s;e things be &amp;c. Je&s;us goes on to demon&s;trate the matter till he comes to &s;peak of the Son of man's being lifted up, as MOSES lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s. A clear type of Chri&s;t's being lifthd up: For as tho&s;e that were &s;tung with the firery Serpents were healed by beholding the brazon Serpent, &s;o &s;inners by looking or believing in Chri&s;t the great antitype, &s;hould receive &s;piritual healing. Therefore Chri&s;t &s;aith, as MOSES lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of man be lifted up; that

who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have etrnal life, for God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting life. Great love indeed; great gift indeed, That when man had broke the law of God and turned rebel, and took up arms again&s;t his Maker, that God &s;hould have &s;uch pity and compa&s;&s;ion on him as to &s;end his Son into the world, to take our law place and die in our &s;tead, for God &s;ent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be &s;aved? And then follows the words of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">: "He that believeth on him is not condemned" That is by faith he receives the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us by which he is &s;et free from the condemning power of the divine law, and &s;o &s;hall be eternally &s;aved, "But he that believes not is condemn'd already" That is, &s;entance of death contained in the law is already pa&s;t upon him and the rea&s;on here for, is given in expre&s;s terms, becau&s;e he hath no believed on the name of the only begotton Son of God</P>

<HEAD>FIRST,</HEAD>
<P>I Am to &s;hew how man came to be in this mi&s;erable condition, GOD at fir&s;t made man holy and upright, and gave him his holy and righteous law, and as long as man kept the law, he remained a happy man. But man being &s;educed and tempted by &s;atan, and giving more credit to what the devil &s;aid, then to what GOD &s;aid, he took up with the devil's coun&s;el, and &s;o broke the law of God. Man was threaten'd with death in ea&s;e of di&s;obedience, and &s;o death took place. man became &s;piritually dead, and under a &s;tate of condemnation. Here infidelity fir&s;t took place in man, by di&s;believeing the &s;everity of God, mani|fe&s;t in the law, hence he is in a &s;tate of condemna|tion by the law; and as there could be no way for his recovery, but by the go&s;pel in which Chri&s;t is &s;et forth to be the only Saviour of &s;inners, his condemnation is argmented by his di&s;believing the go&s;pel which is plainly demon&s;trated in our Text, viz. "becau&s;e he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of GOD."</P>
<P>And &s;o we come to the &s;econd Head, which is,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SESOND.</HEAD>
<P>The mi&s;ery of man in this condition, whil&s;t in this &s;tate he is a &s;tranger to God: And being a &s;tranger to him, he is a &s;tranger to true happine&s;s, he is a &s;tranger to peace? "There is no peace, &s;aith the Lord, unto the wicked" I&s;aiah. vlviii. 22. He is under a broken law and is no ways able to keep it &s;o, being under a broken law, he is under all the cur&s;es of the law, he is at enmity with God. We read the carnal mind, is enmity again&s;t God, not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be, he is under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the great God, that God, that in able to &s;ink him to Hell in a moment, is angry with him, we read God is angry with the
<PB N="7" REF="043017_0006_101CC5790E4DB670">
wicked every day, a wicked man is &s;piritually a dead man, we read of his being dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins: He is di&s;titude of true love to God, which is that charity we read of, that a man is nothing without; he is a &s;lave and captive to &s;atan, we read of his being led captive by him, at his will, he &s;tands at the devils beck, when he &s;ays go, he goeth, and when he &s;ays come, he cometh, he is bent upon doing evil, he hath no mind nor will to do any thing that is good; he is &s;piritually blind and ignorant, he always puts evil for good, and good for evil, light for darkne&s;s, and darkne&s;s for light.</P>
<P>He is always taking a wrong cour&s;e, till enlight|ned by the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of God, he is always &s;eeking after happine&s;s, but in a wrong way, all the powers of his mind are corrupted, his love is always &s;et upon wrong objects, he loves the creature more than the Creator. He always makes a God of &s;omething, be&s;ides the liveing and true God, his will choo&s;es the evil, and re|fu&s;es the good.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t &s;aid, ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life. His memory forgets what it &s;hould remem|ber, &amp; remember vvhat it &s;hould not: he hath a very wicked heart, we read, that the heart is deceitful and de&s;perately wicked, above all things, whil&s;t man remains out of Chri&s;t. He is always a &s;inning in every thing he does, let men pretend to what duty they will, we read that what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in. Men may plea&s;e them&s;elves with abundance of fine Stories, about their good doings, and Mini&s;ters may encourage them on, but every thing they do is &s;in, well &s;ays &s;ome we know that wicked men coimmit a great deal of &s;in but don't they do a great deal of good too, and do a great many duties. I tell you they &s;in in every thing they do, for we read in the word of God, that
<PB N="8" REF="043017_0007_101CC57AC639A890">
what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in, and without faith. it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>The duties may be good of them&s;elves; they may be good as to the matter of them, but bad as to the manner of them, being done out of a wrong end; being not done to the glory of God. Natural men. hath alvvays &s;elf at the bottom; they have &s;ome &s;elf ends in all that they do, they hope to pa&s;&s;ify God, they hope to plea&s;e God, they hope to face the better in this world, or it may be they hope to get to Heaven by their do|ings but this is all wrong. I don't mean to di&s;|courage men from any duty, but what I am after is to drive men off from &s;elf dependence, and not have them flatter them&s;elves up with hopes of getting to heaven, in the way that leads to Hell; not to take pains to build on a &s;andy foundation, and think that they are keeping the commands of God when at the &s;ame time they continue break|ing them.</P>
<P>For God in his word &s;ays, "Wheather you eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God, but wicked men don't do all to his Glory, nor nothing at all as they &s;hould do, and in this ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;e they could do duties without commiting &s;in, what would they do with their &s;ins that's pa&s;t, if they could live a hundred years without one Sin. Still they are under a broken law, and having offended the justice of God, and being under a broken law and not able to make any &s;atisfaction, and altogather unable to keep the lavv.</P>
<P>Man I &s;ay being in this condition is expo&s;ed to all mi&s;eries in this life, to death it&s;elf and to the pains of hell forever, if he dies in this condition.

<HEAD>THIRD,</HEAD>
<P>The great God knew before he made man, what a dreadful condition man would plunge him|&s;elf into, by falling from him and out of infinite love, entered into a covenant with his own dear Son, to give him a number of the poor fallen race to come and redeem and &s;ave by taking their low place, and dying in their room and &s;tead. The Son fore&s;aw the wretched ca&s;e that man would be in, had a like good will to the work he &s;aw, that their was no other way that poor men could be &s;aved and all Gods at|tributes be glorified, &s;o he undertook the great work to come and take the low place of man, to &s;atisfy di|vine ju&s;tice, to fulfil the law and make it honorable: to &s;lept in as a &s;urety, a bond&s;men he undertook in mans behalf, he became the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that beliveth, he &s;atisfied the ju&s;tice of God for all the elect, and wrought out a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ufficient to cloth them with, and the only way any one ever can be &s;aved is by what Chri&s;t hath done and &s;uffered, for there is no other name given under Heaven whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved, their is no other way nor name Chri&s;t &s;aith I am the way, and the truth, and the life: "No man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to &s;inners, is what ju&s;tifies them before God, I&s;aiah xl 21. "The Lord is well plea&s;ed for his righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, he will magnifie the law, and make it honorable." I&s;aiah

<P>They are happy being brought into the favor of God, again David &s;aid, "in thy favour is life, and thy loving kindne&s;s is better than life," they enjoy the love of God, they are pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, John iii. 36. "He that beliveth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life," they are in a &s;afe &s;tate, they are upon a &s;ure foundation, &s;afer then Adam was in the garden. Chri&s;t &s;aith that none &s;hall pluck them out of his hand, Chri&s;t ever loves them, and they love Chri&s;t; read in Solomon Songs of their love to each other, they are &s;afe living and dying: God &s;aith that all things &s;mall work together for good to them that love God. Mark the perfect man and be|hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, they will go to be even with the Lord, Chri&s;t &s;aith, "Father, I will that tho&s;e which thou ha&s;t given me, be with me, that they may behold my glory," John xvii. 24. tho' they may &s;uffer many temptations in this life, and be &s;ometimes over come, yet ble&s;&s;ed be God, Chri&s;t never was overcome, and there is there &s;afety, and they will get by and by, where there will be no trouble, no &s;orrow, no temptation, no|thing to di&s;turb them in all that holy mountain.</P>

Some people &s;ay, they don't care what folks &s;ay about them; but that is wrong, for we are com|manded to cut off acca&s;ion from tho&s;e that &s;eek acca&s;ion, and to ab&s;tain from all appearence of evil: Indeed if we don't give people no ju&s;t acca&s;ion to talk, let them talk, and indeed chri&s;tians can't ex|pect no other, but to be talked about, and per&s;ecu|ted, for we read, and all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution," 2 Tim. iii. 12. And Chri&s;t &s;aid, marvel not if the world hate you. for you know it hated me, before it hated you if ye were of the world, the world would love it's own, but becau&s;e I have cho&s;en you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</P>
<P>But what I &s;ay is, chri&s;tians &s;hould be very care|ful how they give people any cau&s;e to talk about them, they &s;hould take care how they become &s;tum|bling blocks to others: A profe&s;&s;or by his bad con|duct, may become a &s;tumbling block, both to &s;aints and &s;inners, a &s;inner is apt to &s;ay, &s;ee their is &s;uch a one pretends to be a chri&s;tian, but I don't &s;ee but he is as bad as any body, and &s;o they are apt to con|clude, that religion is nothing but a name, and chri&s;tians I believe are many times kept off from their duty, by the bad practices of &s;ome that profe&s;&s;es &s;uch or &s;uch a way, they are apt to &s;ay I can't think

that &s;uch a way is right, there is &s;uch a one that profe&s;&s;es that way, that will do &s;o and &s;o: But let me cau&s;ion all, both &s;aints and &s;inners, not to judge no more after this &s;ort, for this is a wrong way, the bad practices of tho&s;e that profe&s;s religion, never makes that religion, is wrong; religion is the &s;ame, let who will profe&s;s it. It never makes no right way to be wrong, by bad peoples profe&s;&s;ing of it: Nor it never made nor never will make any wrong way to be right.

It would not have done for the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples to have &s;aid, if this Judas follows Chri&s;t, we won't: If they could have known ju&s;t what a man Judas was, and ju&s;t how bad he would do: Nor it did not make that Chri&s;t was wrong. Peter's denying of him, tho' I don't &s;cruple, but what the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples was twited many a time, by their brother Judas, if not by their brother Peter too, tho' Peter was a good man, and had repentance given him, tho' I don't a&s;&s;ert it that they ever were twited by them, becau&s;e I don't know as we have any account of it in the &s;cripture: And &s;ince I have &s;poke of one &s;tumbling block there &s;eems to be &s;ome more come in my mind, which people &s;eem to &s;tumble over in this day, partly much as the Jews did, tho' it &s;eems to be off of the bu&s;ine&s;s that I undertook, yet per|haps it may not be altogether a mi&s;s, and one thing is, if any one that is di&s;pi&s;ed by people in general, and called a poor ignorant per&s;on: If any &s;uch one is brought to under&s;tand any thing about religion, and to &s;peak of the things of God; people think it &s;trange, they can't &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a one knows much, they can't think but that &s;uch a great man, or learnt man, or good mini&s;ter &s;hould know better then the&s;e poor ignorant ones: Strange &s;ay they, if &s;uch a good man, and &s;uch a good mini&s;ter don't know what way is right, ju&s;t like the old Jews, they &s;aid, "have any of the rulers, or of the Phari&s;ees

believed on him? But this people who knoweth not the law are cur&s;ed:" John vii. 48.49. "Chri&s;t thanked his Father, that he had hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes:" Matt. xi, 25. And we read, that not many wi&s;e, not many mighty, not many noble are cho&s;en, but the poor mean and di&s;pi&s;ed, and things that are not to bring to nought, things that are, it &s;eems as if the Rulers and the Phari&s;ees, the great men of the nation had believed on Chri&s;t, that the common people would not a &s;crupled it's being the Chri&s;t, they might &s;ay if this is the Chri&s;t that was provified of by the Prophets: Strange, that the Prie&s;t. Scribes and Phari&s;ees that read &s;o much, have not found it out, we poor people have to work for our living, we have not &s;o much time to read and &s;tudy the &s;criptures, but we mu&s;t tru&s;t to their &s;ay, that know better then we: And &s;o it &s;eems as if a great many people in this day &s;eem to tru&s;t too much to what others &s;ay and do, and not &s;earch for them&s;elves as they ought to do: They &s;ay, there is good Mr. &s;uch a one, and &s;uch a good Mini&s;ter, that &s;aith, &s;uch a way is right, and &s;uch a Mini&s;ter is a learnt man, and he knows better then we: But let whoever hears or reads the&s;e lines, be per&s;uaded to &s;earch the &s;crip|tures, and &s;ee for your&s;elves. Don't pin your faith upon no man's &s;leave. The Scribes and the Phari&s;ees were mi&s;taken, and why is not great and learnt men in our days, as liable to mi&s;takes as they. It &s;eems if Chri&s;t had a come in great worldly grandour, and cho&s;en the Scribes and Pha|ri&s;ees, for his di&s;cipels and followers and conform|ed to the cu&s;toms and traditions of the people. Then the people would fall in with him fa&s;t enough; but Chri&s;t cho&s;e poor fi&s;hermen&punc; and unlearn't, men to be his di&s;ciples: So the Jews &s;aid, this people who know not the law, are acur&s;ed; and &s;o people in this day, a great many &s;eem to think, that no man has any right to preach

without he his college learnt, and will conform to all the traditions of the times; but &s;uch people are very much mi&s;taken, for Chri&s;t will &s;end by whom he plea&s;es, and the word of God is a &s;ufficient rule, for every one of his mini&s;ters to go by, as well as for other men, let the fa&s;hions, and the traditions of men, be what they will.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t return and &s;peak a few words to true believers, and &s;o conclude. And O! Chri&s;tian be|liver, con&s;ider what a great price, Chri&s;t paid for your redemption, to redeem you out of the dreadful e&s;tate of condemnation, which we have been a &s;peeking of, which all mankind were plunged into by their &s;ins: And let a con&s;ideration of this, quick|en you to love, fear and obey, and honor him as long as you live, and &s;trive to keep all his command|ments. The chief Captain told Paul in another ca&s;e, with great &s;um he obtained this freedom, but it was with a great &s;um indeed, that Chri&s;t ob|tained freedom for all his; and let us con&s;ider &s;omething of what he went through, he left his Fa|ther's bo&s;om, came down into this lower world, con|de&s;cended to be born of a Virgin, and when he was fir&s;t born, his be&s;t lodging was a manger; and when he grew up, and came upon his public mini&s;try, be|hold what a treatment he met with from man, when going about up and down in the world, taking ma|ny a wearri&s;ome &s;tep, always a doing &s;ome good to the &s;oul or bodies of men. We never read of his doing any hurt to any one: When his di&s;ciples &s;poke of calling for five from Heaven, he rebuked them, and &s;aid, ye know not what manner of &s;pirit ye are of, for &s;ays he, the &s;on of man did not come to de&s;|troy mens lives, but to &s;ave them: But &s;ee what treatment he met with from a wicked world; he was received, contridicted and fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. He &s;aid, "the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the Son of Man hath not were to lay his head." He was di&s;|pi&s;ed and rejected of men, a man of &s;orrow, and
<PB N="27" REF="043017_0026_101CC5B4599898D8">
acquainted with grief. I&s;aiah. liii. 3. And now, let us follow him to the garden, and there, being in agony, he &s;weats, as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground: And then he was taken, led away to the high prie&s;t, and there he was mocked at, and &s;pit upon, blind folded and beaten: He was betrayed by one di&s;ciple, denyed by another, and for&s;aken by all? And now, behold him brought before PILATE, fal&s;e accu&s;ed and then &s;courged, crowned with thorns and beaten&punc; and after all nailed to the CROSS, there to &s;pill his precious blood.</P>
<P>And how hard hearted and cruel was his mur|derers, when he was thir&s;ty, they gave him vinegar, to drink, and be&s;ides all this that he underwent in his body; Oh! who can think or tell what he under went in his &s;oul; he being in the low place of man, and bearing the puni&s;hment that was due to poor &s;inners to &s;atisfy the ju&s;tice of GOD. He mu&s;t bear puni&s;hment both in his &s;oul and body. He tells his di&s;ciples in the garden, that his &s;oul was exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death; and on the CROSS he cry'd out, my God my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me, it &s;eems as if what he underwent in his &s;oul, ha&s;tened him to his death, it &s;eems by what we read, that he died before tho&s;e that were crucified with him: For when the &s;oldiers came and broke the legs of tho&s;e that were crucified with him. When they came to him and &s;aw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs. And now, can you find in your heart to &s;in again&s;t &s;uch a good and kind God, that hath done &s;o much for you. Be exhorted O believer, to meditate much upon what Chri&s;t hath done and &s;uffered to redeem and &s;ave you, and when tempted to any &s;in, &s;ay as Jo&s;eph did, "How can I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God," and &s;trive to do your duty in all things, and have regard to all God's commands and not think that there is any of them &s;o &s;mall as to be overlook't. Some may &s;ay, you tell us about
<PB N="28" REF="043017_0027_101CC5B5E5960A30">
keeping the commands, and doing our duty, but you don't tell us what our duty is, &s;ome &s;ay one thing is duty, and &s;ome &s;ay another, &s;o we are at a lo&s;e, to know what duty is; we &s;hould be glad to keep the commands of God, if we knew what they were; well, the be&s;t advice that I can give you is. to &s;tudy the word of God, and pray to him to teach you your duty, by his word and &s;pirit, and enable you to do it, and what God &s;aith in his word, that ob&s;erve, let men &s;ay what they will: Whenever their is a contridiction among&s;t people, about what is duty, let your enquiry be what &s;aith the &s;cripture, and let that decide all matters of that &s;ort, and let Chri&s;t be all in all unto you, and pray God to teach you his will, and enable you to do it, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, for of him and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory forever, AMEN.</P>
