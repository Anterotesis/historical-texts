<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THe God of our Fathers hath done great things for this his people, in the sight of the Nations. We have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what work God did in their dayes, how he did drive out the Heathen with his hand, and <HI>Planted</HI> them, how he did af|flict the people and cast them out: for they got not the Land in possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them, but his right Hand and his Arm, and the light of his Countenance, because he had a favour to them. Yea, the Lord hath given us his good Spirit to instruct us, and hath not with|held Manna from us, but hath turned this Wilderness into a <HI>Canaan,</HI> and here hath he given us <HI>Rest</HI> (the Land of <HI>Israel</HI> sel|dome rested longer) fourty years and more: and all this while hath he been feeding and leading of us, by the hands of <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; of <HI>Aaron.</HI> It would fill a Volume, to declare in how many re|spects the Lord hath dealt with us, as he did with his people in the dayes of old. He that hath said, <HI>I will make the Wilderness a Pool of water, and the dry lands Springs of water, I will plant in the Wilderness a Cedar,</HI> hath in an eminent degree fulfilled that word before our eyes. And we may conclude, that the Lord intended some great thing, when he planted these Heavens, and laid the foundation of this Earth, and said unto <HI>New-England</HI> (as some|times to <HI>Sion) Thou art my People</HI>: And what should that be, if not that so a <HI>Scripture-Pattern of Reformation,</HI> as to <HI>Civil,</HI> but especially in <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> respects, might be here erected, as a <HI>First fruits</HI> of that which shall in due time be accomplished the whole world throughout, in that day when there shall be one Lord, and his Name one over all the earth?</P>
<P><PB REF="000197_0003_0FA315FBC73B7890">Upon all which accounts, our not answering Divine Expecta|tions concerning us, hath the more of evil, and of dangerous consequence in it. <HI>Apostacy</HI> in any people is a great provocation to the eyes of Gods glory, but much more in a people whom he hath brought under such manifold Engagements to the con|trary, as is to be affirmed of us, in these goings down of the Sun. It must be confessed to the praise of his glory, that the Lord is not yet wholly gone from us, and there are grounds of hope, that he will not leave us nor forsake us, at least-wise that as yet it shall not be: For there are some (though alas! now but few) of <HI>the first Generation</HI> still surviving, who went after the Lord into this Wilderness, when it was a Land not sown, whose kind|ness God doth remember; and it may be hoped, that there shall be Peace and Truth in their dayes. It must likewise be acknow|ledged, that as for our <HI>Israel, the Leaders thereof,</HI> both in our Ci|vil and Ecclesiastical state, are in some measure faithful. Scan|dalous evils when they break forth, are born witness against, and therefore the Lord will not impute them to the Land where they are committed. When did the Lord ever give up any people to utter destruction, but that first their Magistrates and Ministers were become corrupt? Therefore as yet our <HI>Jerusalem</HI> shall not <HI>become heaps, and the Mountain of the Lords house as the high places of the forrest.</HI> Also the Lord who was still wont, as there were any <HI>beginnings of Apostacy</HI> in his people of old, to <HI>testifie against them by his Spirit in his Prophets,</HI> hath raised up those in this Land, unto whom he hath given grace, and a Spirit of faithfulness to do the like, (witness the ensuing <HI>Sermon</HI>) which is a token for good.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are on the other hand awful Considera|tions, which may cause us to fear vvhat the end vvill be; O that vve vvere vvise, that vve understood these things! We have been, and (through grace) to this day are, <HI>a people near unto the Lord</HI>; but in that respect, vve have the greater cause not to be secure. It is a very solemn Observation, vvhich I remember
<PB REF="000197_0004_0FA315FC87337D98">
<HI>Commenius</HI> hath, speaking of those once-famous and glorious Churches in <HI>Bohemia, viz.</HI> That they were <HI>nearer to the Sanctu|ary</HI> then other Churches, by reason of a more <HI>pure Discipline</HI> by them owned and professed; and therefore when <HI>Contentions</HI> and <HI>Apostacies</HI> prevailed amongst them, the Lord poured down his righteous Displeasures on them, and hath set them forth as sad Examples before other Churches. Let us lay it to heart. And it greatly concerns us so to do, for that there are sad evi|dences of our departures from the Lord in a woful degree, and awful symptomes of the Lords departure from us. Churches a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not wont to cast off the good wayes of God at once, but gradually, it may be more generations then one may pass away first; so neither doth the God of all patience and grace cast off them, but in a gradual way of procedure. How many <HI>stands</HI> did the <HI>glory of the Lord</HI> make, e're it was quite removed, never more to return in the former lustre? Is it not so with this people? In what place can vve behold the glory of the <HI>first Temple?</HI> Do not the ancient men that have seen the <HI>first House,</HI> weep over this? If vve be not at all sensible of these things, our case is no less desperate then <HI>Ephraims,</HI> vvhen gray hairs vvere upon him, but he knew it not. That people vvho vvere newly come out of the hands of those that sometime <HI>said to their Souls, Bow down, that we may go over</HI>; and vvhose present great Interest vvas to carry on <HI>Temple-work,</HI> vvhen arrived at the full enjoy|ment of Peace and Liberty (and in many other respects circum|stanced as vve are this day) soon forgat their main and true In|terest, being under the powerful and prevailing influence of a Worldly degenerating Spirit; and yet they said, <HI>Wherein shall we return?</HI> How many vvith us, are with the same Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the same enquiry? The Reverend Author of this <HI>Sermon,</HI> saw it less needful to insist on the Answer to that, or to speak mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h by vvay of <HI>Conviction,</HI> because that vvould have been <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">um agere,</HI> since God did help that Worthy Servant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, vvho Preached the <HI>Election-Sermon,</HI> but the year immediately pre|ceding,

faithfully, fully, and convincingly to inlarge on that Argument. Moreover (though some deny it) it is a generall Concession amongst us, that vve are in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Apostatizing state,</HI> and therefore that <HI>Reformation</HI> is necessary. Our sins testi|fie against us, and as for our iniquities vve know them: And yet vvhen it cometh to particulars, vve shall finde those calling that <HI>Apostacy</HI> and <HI>Defection,</HI> vvhich the Lord Jesus (I doubt not) will own for Truth and laudable Constancy another day, and con|sequently vvould have that put in practise for <HI>Reformation,</HI> which Christ vvill never own. <HI>Brownism, Libertinism, or undue straitning and confining the grace of that Covenant,</HI> vvhich God hath made vvith our Fathers, is far from being the <HI>Interest of N.E.</HI> and most of all from being the Interest of <HI>Massachusets Colony.</HI> Were our now glorified Fathers (<HI>Winthrope, Dudley, Cotton, Hooker,</HI> vvith the rest of those blessed Worthies, vvho vvere the Instru|ments, under God, of laying the Foundation both of our Civil and Ecclesiastical State) here amongst us, they would say so. Let their Manuscripts and printed Books, which they have left behind them to succeeding generations, come in for Witnesses; and witness the <HI>Platform of Discipline,</HI> agreed on by the <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of all the Churches in this Colony, yea of all these <HI>United Colonies.</HI> Well did our blessed <HI>Mitchell</HI> also give in his Testimony, when speaking in the Name of the Lord, up|on the like solemn Occasion as this Sermon was Preached on; <HI>Do not</HI> (said he) <HI>wrong and marre an excellent work and Profession, by mixing and weaving in spurious Principles and Practices, as those of</HI> Separation, Anabaptism, Morellian (Anarchical) <HI>Confusion, and licentious Toleration. If any would secretly twist in, and espouse such things as these, and make these part of our Interest, we must needs renounce it as none of our Cause, no part of the End and Design of the Lords faithful Servants, when they followed him into this land which was not sown. Separation and Anabaptism are wonted In|truders and seeming Friends, but secret fatal Enemies to Reforma|tion, as</HI> Paul <HI>in a case not much unlike,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.10&mdash; 15. <HI>In this
<PB REF="000197_0006_0FA315FE047ECD78">
work here on foot, there was a good Foundation laid,</HI> viz. <HI>Christ as the onely Law-giver in his Church, and Reformation designed ac|cording to his Will, and Apostolical Pattern. If you should build the Hay and Stubble of such things as those, then verily (though sincere persons will be saved, and the main of the work may be saved and revived at last) yet sooner or later, there will come a fire that will burn up this Stubble, and then your poor Leaders, that would have led you the right way, may be remembred when it is too late. Do not under pretence of avoiding Corruption, run into sinfull Separation from any of the true Churches of God, (and what is good therein) or from the Children of the Covenant. Prize and hold fast the Co|venant to you and yours.</HI> Thus that blessed man. It doth then concern us to take heed, that we do not mistake as to that <HI>Apo|stacy</HI> which is, and the <HI>Anastacy</HI> which ought to be amongst us. And surely it is a safe and undoubted Principle, which runs through that practical and profitable Discourse, to the which these lines are prefixed, <HI>viz. That the great Apostacy of</HI> New-England <HI>is in respect of the Spirits of men, and general decay as to the power of godliness.</HI> Were there a <HI>thorough Reformation</HI> in this matter, we need not fear any evil, but without this, no other <HI>Reformation</HI> will continue the Lords Presence with us. The <HI>first</HI> Design of <HI>New-England</HI> was purely <HI>Religious,</HI> but now we be|gin to espouse, and are eagerly pursuing another, even a <HI>Worldly</HI> Interest. Is not this the grand Procuring Cause of former and present Blastings on the fruits of the earth? And is it not for this sin, that the Lord is at this day seeming to speak as if the Trade of this poor Country should be ruined? These are so|lemn humbling Providences, which God would have us take notice of. Verily the Lord smiteth us, in that which hath been our <HI>Id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l,</HI> i. e. <HI>the World,</HI> that so he may put us in minde of our first and true Interest; yea, that we may <HI>remember whence we are fallen, and repent, and do the first works.</HI></P>
<P>Reader, The ensuing <HI>Sermon</HI> needs no Letters Commenda|tory, especially not from some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a pen as writeth this. The <HI>Vote</HI>
<PB REF="000197_0007_0FA315FEC49C8EA8">
passed in that Honoured Assembly to whom it was preached, de|siring the Author to print what he had preached, is Recom|mendation sufficient. The acceptance also which this Sermon when delivered found with all good men, though of different perswasions, is an evidence, that the Preacher was under a spe|cial guidance and influence from the Spirit of Christ the wis|dome of God. It was the Advice of one of the Ancients, that in Reading Books, we should regard <HI>non scientiam sed sapo|rem:</HI> if we respect either of these, the following Discourse commends it self to the Reader; for that a judicious and sa|voury Spirit doth breathe in it and through it, no understanding Christian can deny.</P>
<P>Now the good Lord, who was with <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> because he walked in the <HI>first wayes</HI> of <HI>David</HI> his father, grant that we may be kept faithful to <HI>the first Principles of New-England,</HI> and that not onely as to our <HI>Church-state,</HI> in respect whereof, we are en|gaged to profess and practise <HI>the Congregational-way of Church-Government,</HI> as instituted by Christ, and held forth in the Scri|ptures of Truth, but also as to our <HI>Civil-state,</HI> which hath been built upon principles of Righteousness and <HI>Sanctity,</HI> the Laws and people of Christ being especially regarded therein, that so <HI>Holiness unto the Lord,</HI> may be upon us in all respects. Then may we expect the continuance both of our Civil and Sacred liberties. That it may be so, is the earnest prayer of him, who hath great reason to esteem himself,</P>

<P><HI>GOD who at sundry times, and in divers manners spake in time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> past to the fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last dayes spo|ken unto us by his Son.</HI> This Book, wherein we finde ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Text, it hath this peculiar unto it, that it bears the <HI>Style</HI> and <HI>Inscription</HI> of this great <HI>Prophet,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ himself, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.1. <HI>The Revelation of Jesus Christ.</HI> And indeed it bears a very lively impression of his <HI>Image</HI> (as it were) in the <HI>Frontispiece</HI> of it, drawn out to the Life by a twofold description of him, in his <HI>Person, Office</HI> and <HI>Work, Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; <HI>ver.</HI> 13, 14, 15, 16&mdash; as also through|out the whole Book, respecting both the Matter of it, and the Manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of delivery, in the Mystery and Majesty of it. It hath also this peculiar Eminency and Excellency, that it contains a <HI>Systeme,</HI> or the Sum of all Gospel Prophesie. It is a <HI>Prophetical Revelation</HI> of all Mysteries of Divine Dispensation, in the whole Series and Succession of it, in every Age and Generation, and in every state and condition of the Church; respecting both the Propagation of his Kingdome, and the destruction of his Enemies, untill all the whole Mystery of God be finished, and Time shall be no longer, (at least) untill the last and utmost Prophetical Period. It is the last great and general <HI>Prophesie,</HI> which doth compleat the <HI>Canon</HI> of Holy Writ, intimated <HI>Chap.</HI> 22.18. <HI>Therefore bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssed is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophesie,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.3. <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>beloved</HI> and <HI>bosome</HI> Disciple, and last Apostle, is the Minister of this Revelation, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. therefore the Dedication of it is from <HI>John,</HI> unto the <HI>Seven Churches in Asia,</HI> Chap. 1. v. 4. <HI>John to the Seven Churches in Asia.</HI> This general or indefinite <HI>Dedication,</HI> makes way for the particular <HI>Inscription</HI> of an Epistle unto the several Angels of those Churches, in the 2<HI>d</HI> and 3<HI>d</HI> Chapters.

Epistles, inscribed, <HI>Vnto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus,</HI> Chap. 2.1. I shall not detain you with any discourse concerning the Scituation of the City, or Typical Relation of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI>; nor stay upon an Artificial Resolution of the Context, by an Analytical Expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion of the Epistle; which are vulgar with Expositors. The way to our Text is easie and open: it lyes in that part of the Epistle which is <HI>Narrative.</HI> The words (as to Mode of expression) they are <HI>Monitory,</HI> and withall highly <HI>Imperative</HI> or Commanding. The duty commanded, it is to la|bour (according to direction given) unto a full and through Restitution from that Declension and Defection in Religion, which that Church was fallen into. In order hereunto, three things are proposed in the words, as parts of the work and duty commanded to be done.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An awakening sight and sense of their declension and defection</HI>; (in these words) <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</HI> The word <HI>Remember</HI> here, it imports an awakening, convincing Remembrance: it is often used in Scripture to express a conscience and conviction of sin, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.61, 63. &mdash;<HI>from whence thou art fallen,</HI> or elapsed, slidden, back|slidden; plainly signifying, Backsliding and Apostacy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A penitential Confession of, and humiliation under the sin of their de|cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nsion and defection</HI>; in this word, <HI>Repent.</HI> It signifies Repentance in the proper act of it, which is <HI>a sad and solemn recognition of, and refle|ction upon our past evil actions, with Confession and Humiliation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Reformation</HI>; in these words, <HI>Do the first works:</HI> which signifie <HI>Reformation</HI> in the proper act of it, positive, practical Reformation; &mdash; <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen, repent, and do the first works.</HI> It is as if our Lord Jesus Christ should have said unto this Angel and Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Although thou hast been commendable (and I have commended thee) for thy strong and stedfast perseverance, by the great labour of thy Faith and Patience, in the sincere, pure, and powerful Pro|fession of the Gospel, respecting both Doctrine and Worship, with ex|traordinary Zeal against Heresie and Apostacy, Hereticks and Apostates, and that also with extraordinary Courage and Constancy, under many great Temptations, and much and great Tribulation: and although thou hast been extraordinarily beautified and blessed with my Presence, in the exercise of my Kingly and Prophetical Office; though thou hast been Eminent, yea Excellent among the Churches; and although thou dost yet hold up thy Profession in the external Form of it, and dost there|fore still deserve some Commendation: Yet know, O <HI>Ephesus,</HI> that thou art fallen; thou hast left thy first love, thou hast lost thy first life, thou hast deserted thy first works; thou art not what thou hast bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<PB N="3" REF="000197_0010_0FA3160105872170">
thou art fallen into a state, frame, and way of backsliding and Apostacy. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and labour to reco|ver thy self speedily from thy declension and defection, and to retrive thy pristine and primitive Profession and practise of Religion, unto its former internal and spiritual Life and Power, from which it is chiefly that thou art fallen, or else I will withdraw my gracious Presence from thee, and come unto thee quickly in my wrath, and devest thee of all thy Priviledges, Church-Order, Ordinances and Administrations, of the Dignity and Beauty, yea of the very Being of a Church, by the Amo|ture of the Candlestick: <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen,</HI> &amp;c. The words thus plainly opening themselves unto us, afford us this Do|ctrine.</P>
<Q><HI>Doct.</HI> That it is the present, and most important Duty and Concernment of any Collapsing or Back-sliding Church or Churches, to labour (un|der an Awakening, Convincing sight and sense (or under an Awaken|ing Conviction) of their Declension and Defection) unto a full and through Restitution from it, by Repentance and Reformation.</Q>
<P>The Text it self is so good a Doctrine, it doth seem needless to invert the terms of it. It is enough to say, That it is the work and duty of any Church or Churches, which are in the like declining and decaying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which this Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was in, to Remember from whence they are fallen, to repent, and to do their first works. It is the present, instant, and most important duty, it is indeed all the work and duty which our Lord Jesus Christ doth commend and propound unto, and press upon this Church in this whole Epistle, and so unto and upon all other Churches in the like state: and he doth propose it plainly and fully in all the parts of it, that they might have a full and distinct understand|ing of it, and direction unto it; that they might be through and effe|ctual in the pursuance and performance of it. He proposeth it also as a most important duty and concernment, as that upon which depended their very Being and Standing as a Candlestick amongst the Candlesticks, as a Church among the Churches. He proposeth it as a work and duty which they had yet great advantage and encouragement to labour in, under the powerful exercise of his Kingly and Prophetical Office; and therefore he represents himself unto this declining Church (for their encouragement) as <HI>walking amidst the golden Candlesticks,</HI> and <HI>holding the Stars in his right hand</HI>; that is, in his full and whole Sufficiency to uphold his Church, in its Constitution, and in the pure and powerful Administration both of Doctrine and Worship; and by a powerful and effectual dispensation of his Spirit and Grace, to restore and recover
<PB N="4" REF="000197_0011_0FA31601C6D4C398">
them from their present declension and defection. He also proposeth it as a work and duty requiring present, instant dispatch, which must be quickly done: and he presseth it, upon penalty of Unchurching Judge|ments, and so upon peril of gross, open, total, and final Apostacy, im|plied in the removal of the Candlestick, and finally moving of them hereunto, by a great and most gracious Promise of perseverance in case of obedience, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. <HI>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</HI> Thus you see how full both the Text and the Context are of this Doctrine. And this is also the great work and duty, which God did propound and press by all his Prophets, upon the Church of old, in their <HI>declining and decaying state,</HI> which for many Ages together they were in. It was Gods great work by the Ministry of those great Prophets, whose Prophesies are re|corded in Scripture, to convince them of their <HI>Back slidings and Apo|stacy,</HI> and to perswade them to return by <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI> The general word of the Lord by those Prophets, it was <HI>Turn, O back|sliding children; Return, O backsliding Israel&mdash; Repent, and turn ye; Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.12, 14, 22. <HI>&amp;</HI> 4.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 18.11. <HI>Ezek</HI> 14.6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 33.11. <HI>Hos.</HI> 12.6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14.1. It was the great work of those Prophets, to bring back this people unto God: 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24.19. <HI>Yet he sent Prophets to them, to bring them again to the Lord.</HI> It was the general cry of all the Prophets, <HI>Zech.</HI> 1.3, 4. <HI>Turn ye now unto me, saith the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Be not as your fathers, unto whom the former Prophets cried, Turn ye now</HI>&mdash; Observe&punc; Repentance and Reformation it was the gene|ral cry of the Prophets to that backsliding people: whence it doth ap|pear, that it was their great and main work and duty, to Repent and Re|form. I might further <HI>demonstrate,</HI> argue, and prove this Doctrine from the suitableness of this work and duty, unto a <HI>back-sliding</HI> people, (it is the proper work of such a people;) as also from the necessity of it, and from the good and benefit of it, and from all <HI>Topicks</HI> of Reasons and Arguments: but it being of undeniable, and therefore of unque|stionable verity, I shall take leave (for brevity's sake) to pretermit what might or ought to be spoken for the more full <HI>Proof</HI> and <HI>Explication</HI> thereof, and proceed unto <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P>Wherein, I shall apply my self unto the Churches, and unto the Peo|ple of <HI>New-England,</HI> so far (at least) as they may be spoken unto in one <HI>General Assembly</HI>; and I shall address my self unto You, as in the Name, so in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, by this threefold Ex|hortation.

<P><HI>Exhort.</HI> I. <HI>Remember from whence thou art fallen.</HI> Let this be an Awakening Watch-word from our Lord Jesus Christ, unto these slum|bering Churches in this Midnight of deep Security, wherein the gene|rality both of Christians and Churches, are disposing, yea composing of themselves to sleep, by indulging themselves unto carnal rest and ease, shutting their eyes against all awakening discoveries, and stopping their ears against all awakening voices; yea, although it be the voice of their <HI>Beloved:</HI> as the Spouse, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.2, 3. <HI>I sleep, but my heart waketh, it is the voice of my Beloved that knocketh&mdash; I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</HI> Surely an Awakening Watch-word is then most necessary and seasonable; and ne|ver more, then in sleepy and sleeping Times, when <HI>Judicial Security</HI> seemeth to be both one of the greatest <HI>Sins</HI> and <HI>Plagues</HI> of the Times; when God in just Judgement is <HI>pouring out of a spirit of deep sleep, and closing the eyes of men,</HI> as <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.10. and <HI>giving a spirit of slumber, Rom.</HI> 11.8. No doubt but this Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> was deeply secure, under her deep declension: Spiritual declension doth incline both Chri|stians and Churches unto Security; whilst the wise Virgins lamps want|ed trimming, and the foolish Virgins lamps were gone out, <HI>they all slumbered and slept,</HI> Mat. 25.5. as Christians or Churches decline, so they grow secure, and fall asleep. The Church of old, both <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> were most prodigiously secure in the depth of their Apostacy: the Prophets did prophesie Peace, and the people did promise themselves peace, untill they had consummated both their Apostacy and Misery, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6.14. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8.11. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13.10, 16. Truly thus it is (too much) with us, the more sinful we grow, the more secure; the generality of the Generation growing more and more sensless, supine, stupid, sottish in their security. Hence, although we hear all kinde of Awakening Voices, and see many Awakening Sights; though the voice of God doth <HI>Cry</HI> by his Word, as <HI>Zech.</HI> 1.4. yea though it doth <HI>Roar</HI> by his Works, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.8. yet we are not awakened: Though there be a grievous and general Complaint and Cry of the great &amp; Crying sins of the Times, yea

<P>First, <HI>It should be our labour to get a new Heart and new Spirit.</HI> This is the life and spirit of the work of Reformation, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.30, 31. <HI>Re|pent, and turn your selves from your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruine&mdash; and make you a new heart, and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</HI> When God doth work reforming grace, and re|new his Covenant with his people, upon terms of Reformation, he doth first take away the corrupt, hard, impenitent, unbelieving, backsliding, apostatizing heart, and gives them <HI>a new heart, and a new spirit,</HI> Jer. 31.33. &amp; 32.39. Ezek. 11.19. &amp; 36.26. The <HI>foundation</HI> of the work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> it must be laid in a <HI>new heart,</HI> because the original of our defection and Apostacy, it is in the heart: and therefore God every|where complaineth of that backsliding people, that they had an <HI>uncir|cumcised heart,</HI> Jer. 9.26. <HI>a whorish heart,</HI> Ezek. 6.9. that <HI>their heart was set upon their iniquity,</HI> Hos. 4.8. Truly, so it is, the very heart of <HI>New-England</HI> is changed, and exceedingly corrupted with the sins of the Times: there is a Spirit of Profaneness, a Spirit of Pride, a Spirit of Worldliness, a Spirit of Sensuality, a Spirit of Gainsaying and Rebel|lion, a Spirit of Libertinism, a Spirit of Carnality, Formality, Hypo|crisie, and Spiritual Idolatry in the Worship of God. Sinners are spi|rited unto, and with the sins of the Times, those sins are even rooted end grounded in the Spirit of the Generation, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.1. <HI>The sin of

of Religion in this next succeeding generation?

O Christians, <HI>It is your Spiritual Declension that is the main root of the degeneracy of this Noble Vine,</HI> Jer. 2.21. It is your leaving of your first love, which doth make way for the removal of the Candlestick; your Spiritual declension will lead the way unto, and lay the foundation for, the general and total defection of these Churches in succeeding generations: therefore, as the defection hath been in part begun by your declension; so the work of <HI>Reforma|tion</HI> it must be begun by your <HI>restitution.</HI> It is impossible that ever these Churches should be restored unto their first Spiritual prosperity, and flourishing state, unless Christians do first recover their first love, life, sincerity, fervency, purity, activity, eminency in the exercise of grace, and in the performance of duty, and in all practical piety, both in heart and life. O how can you hope to lye down in your Graves with peace and comfort, before you have done what in you lyeth in the Work of Reformation? How can you die in peace, under your Spiritual declen|sions, and thereby leave Religion decaying and dying, and these Chur|ches, and this Generation, your poor Posterity, sinking under a ge|neral and total defection? Sure, in vain, and frustrate will be all your prayers, desires, hopes of a Reformation, except that you Christians do thus begin, and lay the foundation of the work in your own hearts before you die.</P>

any generation, whereby it is wholly turned into the degenerate plant of a strange Vine, unto the Lord. Here will be our deepest, and most dangerous defection, and that which will prove inevitably ruining unto these Churches, unless the Lord have mercy upon us. O our unbelief, and disobedience unto the Gospel, our rejection of Christ and his King|dome! It is <HI>a most sad and lamentable sign,</HI> that these Churches, and Religion, are falling into an irreparable, irrecoverable decay, That there are so <HI>many of the generation growing up under the Ministry of the Word, and the improvement of all means of grace, in their Vnregeneracy,</HI> under the prevailing power of Spiriritual Apostacy and (as we have cause to fear) under a dreadful dispensation of divine Justice, by Spiri|tual Plagues and Judgements, being justly given up by God, unto a spirit, frame, and way of unprofitableness under a <HI>Judicial Ministry,</HI> sent <HI>to make their heart fat, lest they should be converted,</HI> as <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.10&mdash; O it is a fearful word, <HI>Lest they should see with their eyes,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash; <HI>and con|vert, and be healed.</HI> Observe, there is no help, no healing for any peo|ple, if the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>Conversion</HI> cease amongst them. Truly, it is a mat|ter of very sad Consideration unto us, that the work of <HI>Conversion</HI> doth fall, and is failing more and more, in many (if not) in most Con|gregations: although we have cause, with thankfulness, to acknow|ledge the Presence and Power of the Spirit of God (so far) with his Mi|nistry, that there is yet some fruit of their labour appearing in the work of Conversion; but alas! not with proportion unto the great increase of the generation. O how rarely do we hear of a sound work of Conversion, held forth with full and clear demonstration of the sin|cerity of it! O how few such Converts are there, as do evidence their Conversion by a powerful, practical Profession of Religion? Multi|tudes there are growing up in their Ignorance, Atheism, Unbelief, and Profaneness, who receive no impression at all by the Word of God; and many others who do receive some degrees of common grace, who yet fall away by Spiritual Apostacy, who prove either vain, profane Professors, or close Hypocrites, or gross Apostates. Truly, unless God in infinite Mercy revive and uphold the work of Conversion, there will be no hope, we shall perish under this our Spiritual Apostacy, which is begun: for if the work of Conversion fail, all the sins of the Times will be multiplied and aggravated; and unconverted sinners will be in just Judgement given up to God, unto the power of those sins, so that our sins will become our plagues, and those incurable. O that all un|converted sinners might be moved, to wait earnestly upon God in the improvement of all means for converting grace, and bemoan them|selves

When the heart of a people is gone from God and his Worship, it argues their heart is corrupted with a spirit of Will-worship, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.13&mdash; there is a whorish heart, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 6 9. <HI>They have broken me with their whorish heart</HI>; there is a <HI>spirit of whoredome,</HI> Hos. 4.12. How far the heart of <HI>New-England</HI> is cor|rupted with this spirit of Will-worship, with prae-dispositions and incli|nations thereunto, would (we may fear) too soon and sadly appear, un|der a temptation thereunto.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us watch against all the wayes and workings of it,</HI> even the se|cret, subtile, insensible insinuations and intrusions of it; against all the depths and devices of Satan, working by the darkest and deepest Coun|sels of Hell, to introduce Will-worship into Reformed Churches. We may think our selves secure from it, unless over-born by the over-powering violence of some external Temptation: but believe it, Satan hath divers and various Forms of Will-worship, suited and accommoda|ted to the divers constitutions &amp; conditions of Churches, and the diverse spirit and disposition of people that he hath to deal withall; he hath <HI>many Antichrists,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.17. there is a divers working of the spirit of Anti|christ, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.3. This spirit worketh by the <HI>pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of Satan, in a My|stery of Iniquity,</HI> 2 Thess. 2.7. And truly, we have had many Antichrists. It hath been alwayes Satans design, to introduce corrupt Worship into these Churches, under the most specious and spiritual Forms of it, by a direct contrary Extreme unto gross Ceremony and Superstition; the more cause we have to be very watchful, against all such wayes and workings of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us watch against all Temptations unto corrupt Worship,</HI> whether more secret, or more open. There are many Temptations thereunto: there is the Temptation of false Teachers, corrupting the Doctrine of Worship, and teaching of Will worship, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. <HI>Teaching for do|ctrines the Commandments of men</HI>: Rev. 2.20. &mdash;<HI>to teach, and to seduce</HI>&mdash; There is the Temptation of corrupt <HI>Communion,</HI> temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Communion, <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> 2.18. <HI>Let no man beguile you,</HI> &amp;c.

The Interest of a Party, it is a very great and strong Temptation: &amp; spi|rit of Division, (especially) when acting and working with a blinde, in|ordinate, preposterous, superstitious Zeal in matters of Worship, and when it is become <HI>judicial and incurable,</HI> never fails to bring in corrupt Worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p at one door or another. It is the design of Satan, to bring in Will-worship in the smoke and smother of the fire of Contentions; Di|visions do alwayes corrupt Churches. There is also the Temptation of an undue <HI>Toleration,</HI> which doth open a way to all the former, and lead into corrupt Compliances in wayes of corrupt Worship, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.20. There is also the Temptation of Persecution, and Tribulation&mdash; O there are many Temptations unto corrupt Worship, and these Churches have not been without some of these Temptations thereunto; such Tempta|tions are likely to multiply upon us. O what cause have we then to be zealously and wakefully watchful, more especially against such Tempta|tions which are instant, and most urgent and prevalent, and of which we do already begin to see and feel the sad and lamentable effects: and that considering there is such a prae-disposition in the very Spirit and Consti|tution of the Generation, to enter into this Temptation, and such a powerful working of a Spirit of <HI>Libertinism,</HI> to make way for, and lead into this Temptation; and also that men of corrupt Spirits, Principles and Practises, scandalous, corrupters, and broachers of corrupt Wor|ship, open and professed Enemies unto pure Churches, Worship and Ordinances, are arisen unto so high a degree of bold Presumption a|mong us; and that notwithstanding, they know that Publick Authority is by good and wholsome Laws, and so by Oath, and so by Conscience, and by divers obligations, both Civil and Sacred, engaged against them. I am no Casuist, in the great Case of <HI>Toleration,</HI> neither shall I under|take either to state, dispute, or decide that Question; what is in it self, or in divers respects or cases, at divers times and places, either Tolerable or Intolerable, in matters disputable: But this I take to be un|deniable, That gross, bold, scandalous, presumptuous tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sgression of any one, or more, or all the Commandments of the <HI>First Table,</HI> perpe|trated and persisted in with an high hand, notwithstanding <HI>all due means of Conviction</HI> used, and against clear l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght held forth, and manifestly under the Prevailing Power of a Spirit of Errour, with malignity, in open opposition to the Truth, the true Churches, worship and ordinan|ces of Christ; I say, I take it to be unquestionable, That such trans|gression it is <HI>Intolerable.</HI> Such I take to be the transgression of those <HI>who do grosly and scandalously profane any of the holy Ordinances of

Surely if it be thus, or likely to be thus, then there is very great need of watchfulness a|gainst this Temptation. Neither let it be slighted, or accounted a light thing: for, such Profanations and Abominations, if <HI>Indulged,</HI> will be|come the sins of the Land, and the guilt and Punishment of them will lye, and fall exceeding heavy upon the Land in a day of wrath: O they will pull down wrath upon this Land, and upon this People; and the filth of them will pollute and defile the Land: it will be such Pollution as will not be purged away without fire, the guilt and filth of corrupt wor|ship, is not purged away without the fire and the fornace. And that which is most Perillous, it is the universal diffusion of the Corruption and Contagion of corrupt worship, by the subtile and insensible infusion and influence of a Spirit of <HI>Libertinism:</HI> a <HI>Spirit and Principle</HI> (it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) of all other, most dangerous and destructive unto Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Churches, and will soon open a wide door unto all kinde of Abominations: for all false worships, (although they seem, in themselves, to be contrary Ex|tremes) yet they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l agree in this Principle of <HI>Libertinism,</HI> and will bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that door.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Labour unto the promotion and progress of the work of Reformation, by the full and faithful discharge of duty to the Children of the Covenant,</HI> multiplying and growing up under the Covenant in these Churches&punc; un|der how great and general omission of duty towards them, we have cause seriously and sadly to consider, and to lament. Truly, it is much
<PB N="24" REF="000197_0031_0FA31610C4BD8BF8">
to be feared, that we shall so long doubt and dispute the <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> of such Children, and controvert, and neglect our duty towards them, untill the holy Seed will be wholly corrupted, and the Purity, if not the Constitution of these Churches be greatly endangered, if not lost. It is sad to consider, how much many Churches are already cor|rupted, by the Licentiousness and Profaneness of many, if not most of the Children of the Covenant. Many, if not most, of the sins of Youth (which are many of them some of the most fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gitious sins of the Times) are become the sins of Churches, and the guilt of them doth lye heavi|ly upon Churches, with this heavy aggravation, that they are commit|ted through the neglect of duty towards them, by the due exercise of <HI>Discipline.</HI> If yet there be <HI>any hope in Israel concerning this thing,</HI> (as it is spoken of a very difficult Point of <HI>Reformation) Ezra</HI> 10.2. I say, if there be any hope of Reformation in this matter, it must be by a holy, religious, saving Education of the Children of the Covenant, and that both in Private and in Publick. Doubtless there is an extraordinary obli|gation upon Covenant-Parents, to train up their Children for God; and a great motive it is unto all care, labour and diligence, unto such Re|ligious Family-Education, for such Parents to consider, that their Chil|dren are Children of the Covenant, and in this sense <HI>Gods Children,</HI> as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.20, 21. and the <HI>Children of the Promise,</HI> Acts 2.39. and so un|der a special Promise of saving grace and blessing: on the other hand, it is a very sad and lamentable consideration, unto any Religious Parent, to consider, that his Children should (through his neglect of Educa|tion) be instrumental, by their Profaneness and wickedness, to corrupt, pollute and defile the Church of God. O if ever you would do any thing for the recovery, and Propagation of these Churches, labour herein. The corruption of Churches doth begin in Families, and if there be no hope of <HI>Family Reformation,</HI> there is no hope of <HI>Church Refor|mation.</HI> It is indeed sad to consider, how many Families are already grown incorrigible and incurable. Labour to imitate faithful <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 18.19. But that which I chiefly intend, in this Particular, is <HI>Publick Education,</HI> (if I may so call it) Surely Churches do owe much duty un|to the Children of the Covenant, commonly styled, <HI>The Children of the Church:</HI> they are doubtless the Subject of the especial care and industry of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> to be watched over, warned, instructed, admonished, both Privately and Publickly. <HI>Churches</HI> also are to own them, and ac|knowledge them, visibly, as they do gradually grow up unto maturity and capacity unto Church-watch and Priviledges. If they be in any wise under the Covenant, and so of <HI>the visible Kingdome of Christ,</HI> they

O they have been very unhappy Controversies to these Churches, whereby the vigorous exercise of <HI>Discipline</HI> unto these, hath been so long demurred and delayed, that very many of them are grown up unto such an height and strength in Profaneness, that they have even broken, and cast off the Yoke of Christs Government in his Church, and are grown incorrigible, and incurable by <HI>Discipline.</HI> And truly, this neglect is grown so great and general (at least) in some Churches, that there is very little hope of the recovery of the vigorous, effectual exercise of <HI>Discipline</HI> toward them. So that the current of the cor|ruption of the Generation, is l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kely to break in like a flood upon the Churches at this breach, and in short time to carry all before it. <HI>It is one of the most fatal signs which is upon these Churches,</HI> that this one evil is likely to prove both rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and remediless; and is the more sadly signal, because we are no more sensible of it, and no more concerned by our Prayers and Endeavours to Reform it.

We must also exercise and improve our Christian Liberty in a way of full subjection unto the Power, Rule and Government of Christ Ministerially exercised in his Church, in the Administration of all his ordinances, as the free Subjects of his Spiritual Kingdome. Those who rise up in a way of opposition unto, or rebellion against the Power of Christ, regularly exercised in his Church, under pretence of the defence of their Liberty, are no true friends to true Liberty. VVe must also improve and exercise our Liberty in way of Love, Peace, Union, and Communion, unto mutual edification and comfort: <HI>By love serving one another,</HI> Gal. 5.3. O this is the onely sweet and comfortable life of Chri|stian Liberty. It is a very sinful, shameful abuse of Christian Liberty, to make it an <HI>occasion to the flesh,</HI> to make it subservient to Libertinism, to Licentiousness, to carnal Reason and Policy, to worldly Designs and Ends, to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of men, in fomenting Divisions &amp; Contentions, and of making it <HI>a cloak of maliciousness,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.16 &mdash; Surely it is a great part of our work of Reformation, to Reform these Abuses of our Christian Liberty.

<P>I shall take leave (now in the Conclusion) to propose this general Exhortation unto Reformation, more particularly, unto those who are especially concerned as Reformers.</P>
<P N="1">I.

There|fore God Spirited our <HI>first Magistracy</HI> unto this Work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> and prospered that glorious Work unto a very happy progress, under their Civil Conduct of this Religious and Reforming people. And now the Place, the Power, the whole Betrustment of this <HI>Reforming Magi|stracy,</HI> it is by our Annual <HI>Election,</HI> and so by a Providential Succession, devolving upon You, and remaineth vested in You. Therefore our eyes, our hearts, our hopes, are (under God, and as to men) much upon You as our Reformers.

<P N="2">II. I shall take leave to propose this Exhortation unto the <HI>Ministry of these Churches,</HI> nextly concerned, as Publick Reformers, in the Work of Reformation. It is proposed in the Text, directly, <HI>To the Angel of the Church of Ephesus.</HI> The Angels of the Churches are particularly directed unto, and charged with this Work, in the several Churches. The <HI>first Ministry</HI> of these Churches, it was eminently a <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">forming Ministry,</HI> extraordinarily qualified unto, and improved in, the Work of Reformation: God made them great <HI>Reformers,</HI> and wrought a great Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> by them; and they lived faithfully labouring in that Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k unto the death, though not without some discouragement, and some diminution of their joy and comfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, from a prae-apprehen|sion, yea from some present appearance of the sad signs of the defection of these Churches, before their departure. That Ministry, <HI>those Mi|nisters,</HI> they are generally departed; (some few (here and there one, onely) of that Ancient <HI>Old England-Ministry,</HI> remaining with us, as the Crown and Ornament of our <HI>New-England-Presbytery.</HI>) And truly, the remembrance of the departure of that Ministry, with the signal Circumstances, and sad Consequences thereof, may justly mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e lamen|tation; they being divers of them carried away (as it were) in <HI>Chariots of fire:</HI> I mean&punc; by an Anticipation of their translation, in the ordinary

course of Nature, and when in the strength and travail of their Ministe|rial Labours, for these Churches, and with this Generation; bearing a full clear Testimony unto the great duties, and against the great sins of the Times, and standing in the Gap before God, to turn away impend|ing Judgements. Their Praise is yet fresh and flourishing in these Chur|ches, being legible in <HI>living Epistles of Commendation, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the living God.</HI> They have a living <HI>Memory,</HI> and a lasting <HI>Monument</HI> in every godly heart, who hath experienced the con|verting, quickning, comforting presence and power of the Spirit in their Ministration. They are departed, and we have <HI>wept over their faces</HI> with that Lamentation, <HI>My father, my father, the Chariots of Isra|el, and the Horsmen thereof.</HI> The Burthen of the Work of the Ministry, and so of this great Work of Reformation in these Churches, it now resteth upon you, who are the present standing Ministry, this <HI>New-England Ministry,</HI> which is Coaevall and Coaetaneous with this <HI>New-England Generation</HI>; Amongst whom, I am not worthy to be mention|ed as one (though with the utmost expression of diminution, as less then the least of those whom God hath called forth to take a part of this Mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">try) and therefore most unmeet and unworthy thus to speak unto you: yet I am bold to beseech you to bear this Exhortation from the Lord Jesus Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st&punc; in whose Name I speak, and say, O <HI>Labour to be a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">forming Ministry.</HI> Although there hath been a change of Ministers in mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the Churches, yet we hope there is not a change of the Mi|ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">try, but that the same Ministry is still remaining; that is, a Ministry of the same Constitution, Spirit, Principles, Minde, Judgement and Pra|ctise, in all things pertaining to the Work of the Ministry in these Chur|ches; a Ministry, which hath received not onely <HI>the Mantle,</HI> but a por|tion of <HI>the Spirit of Elijah.</HI> And therefore, you are engaged to under|take, to uphold, and to carry on the same Work of Reformation, in all the parts of it, and to labour unto the progress of it, in the Spirit and Power of it, so far as you are concerned, respecting either Doctrine, Profession or Practise. More especially, God expecteth that you should promote the Work of Reformation, in your several Churches and Con|gregations, by the regular and thorough exercise of the Power of Christ (committed unto you) in the Administration of Doctrine and Worship, which is the great Trust and Charge committed unto you to keep, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6 20. This is <HI>the Rod of his strength out of Zion,</HI> whereby his people are made a <HI>willing people in the day of his power,</HI> Psal. 110.2, 3. Exalt Christ, by the due exercise of his Power in his Name, that Christ may reign Ministerially in these Churches. The Rule and Government
<PB N="34" REF="000197_0041_0FA3161845692990">
of Christ powerfully Administred, would soon Reform all. O that Di|scipline might be restored, unto the full and effectual exercise of it, in the Spirit and Power of it, unto all the saving Ends of it, in these Chur|ches! it would work a great Reformation. And O that this poor Ge|neration, which is committed Chiefly to the Charge of this Ministry, may be generally cared for in all the Churches. They are the Genera|tion, which you are called to labour with and for, amongst whom you hope to have the fruit of your Labours in the Work of the Ministry, and whom you are to stand in Judgement with, and to give an account of, in the day of Account. O what Account will be given of them, if many, or the generality of them, should perish, under the neglect of the due exercise of the Ministerial Power of Christ towards them, in any of the Churches? Most of all the Work of Reformation, depend|eth upon the faithful and successful Labours of this Ministry, in the work of Conversion; the travail of your Souls in that work, your travailing wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Souls in that work of Conversion. Here lyes the stress, and the life and spirit of the Work of Reformation; without which, all Ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yes, Endeavours, and Labour therein, and thereunto, will be ut|terly vain and void. If God make this Ministry a <HI>Converting Ministry</HI>; the Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> will be again revived; but if God suffer it to be a <HI>Judicial Ministry,</HI> a Ministry sent in Judgement, <HI>to make the heart of this people fat</HI>&mdash; then there will be no hope, the Generation will grow sick at heart, under <HI>Spiritual Plagues and Judgements,</HI> under <HI>a sa|vour of death,</HI> by this Ministry, and so die in their sins. <HI>A Judicial Mi|nistry hath alwayes been the fatall Cause of the finall Ruine of such a peo|ple,</HI> as <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.10. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.13, 14. <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.40. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.32. And therefore, how are all such, who have the Charge of Souls in such a dangerous time, amongst a declining people, concerned to Labour, to Pray, to Preach, to be instant in season, out of season, in private, in publick, to spend their Souls, to bend the strength of their Ministerial Labours, un|to the Conversion of Souls? How did the Prophets of old labour, in like case, with a declining people, and dolefully lament the loss of their labour; so <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Isa 49.4. <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Jer. 6.10. yea, our Lord Jesus Christ himself, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. <HI>O Jerusalem, &mdash; how often would I have gathered thy Chil|dren</HI>&mdash; Truly, it is a most doleful discouragement to the present Mini|stry, in many Congregations, to see so many Souls fatting, hearts hard|ning, immortal Souls dying and perishing under their hand, Care and Charge; but yet they must labour, and Agonize in Prayer unto God, for a dispensation of Converting grace by their Ministry, that the Work of Conversion, and so the Work of Reformation, may be revived: for
<PB N="35" REF="000197_0042_0FA31619057A8AC8">
if not, it is much to be feared, that <HI>the Sun</HI> will quickly <HI>go down over the Prophets:</HI> I allude unto <HI>Mic.</HI> 3.6.&mdash; I mean, that our day of grace will expire, and <HI>the Sun set upon these Churches,</HI> by the departure of the Mi|nistry, and so <HI>our house be left unto us desolate,</HI> as <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.38, 39. The Prosperity of these Churches, dependeth much upon the success of the Labours of this present Ministry: and therefore, the hopes, desires, and prayers of all the faithful people of God in these Churches are, That you may alwayes remain as <HI>Stars in the right hand of Jesus Christ,</HI> fixed in your Orb, full of Light, Regular in all your Motions, Powerfull in all your Influences, shining in all your Appearances, with the Splendor and Lustre of his <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> in whose hand you are: And that there may be no such <HI>Wandering Stars,</HI> spoken of <HI>Jude</HI> v. 13. whose Er|ratick Motions should disturb the Coelestial Order and Harmony of our Ecclesiastical Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">III. I propose this Exhortation also unto <HI>All the People of the Land,</HI> who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e present; and O that <HI>whole New-England</HI> might be moved with this word of Exhortation, &mdash; <HI>Repent, and do the first works.</HI> O that the heart of this people might be moved, as the heart of one man, unto the Work of <HI>Reformation!</HI> It is a general Work, our <HI>defection</HI> it is ge|neral, and therefore our Reformation it must be also <HI>general.</HI> Of old, the Work of Reformation it was alwayes wrought by all the people, as you may reade 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 23.3. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.36. <HI>&amp;</HI> 34.30. the Text saith there, <HI>All, small and great:</HI> So <HI>Ezra</HI> 109. <HI>Neh.</HI> 8.1. &mdash; <HI>All the the people as one man</HI>; every one that is able to do any thing, must bear his part in the Work of Reformation. Every one hath a particular work of Reformation, in and for himself, to Reform himself, his own heart, and his own life; if every one could Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orm one, it would be a great and general Reformation. Every one, that hath a Soul to save, or hath any care of his Salvation, is concerned in this Work of Reforma|tion, of what degree, rank or order whatsoever; every one must la|bour, in his own person, in his proper place, by the utmost improve|ment of his power, interest and influence, to help forward the work; every one must set his hand and heart unto the Work of Reformation, in Families, Towns, Churches, throughout the Country. The Work of Reformation, it must run through all our hearts and wayes, in every Station and Relation, in every Calling and Imployment, through all mat|ters both Civil and Religious, in all our converse with God and man. There is nor one here present in the Congregation, but is concerned in this Work of Reformation.</P>

So also do all Worldly and Self-seeking persons, by sinking the Interest of Religion, and raising a Worldly Interest, and so building up their own Self-interests upon the ruines of the Publick. So also do all Factious, Seditious, and Conten|tious persons, who make it their design and work to foment Divisions, and to uphold dividing Parties and Interests, unto the shaking of very Foundations. So also do all corrupt Worshippers, and corrupters of the Worship of God. In a word, so do all Carnal, Formal, Hypocritical Pro|fessors. And so do all the Capital leading sinners of the Times, and of the Generation.
