<HEAD>A COPY OF VERSES Made by that Reverend Man of God Mr. <HI>John Wilson,</HI> Pastor to the first Church in <HI>Boston</HI>; On the sudden Death of M^R^. Joseph Brisco, Who was translated from Earth to Heaven <HI>Jan.</HI> 1. 1657.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Not by a Fiery Chariot as <HI>Elisha</HI> was,</L>
<L>But by the Water which was the outward cause:</L>
<L>And now at last unto <HI>Christ</HI> his Saviour dear,</L>
<L>Though he hath left his dear Relations here.</L></Q>

<L>THere is no <HI>Job</HI> but cries to God and hopes,</L>
<L>And God answer in Christ; to cries he opes,</L>
<L>Out of the deeps to him I cry'd and hop'd,</L>
<L>And unto me his gracious ear is op'd:</L>
<L>Doubt not of this ye that my death bewail;</L>
<L>What if it did to strangers me assail:</L>
<L>What if I was so soon in Waters drown'd,</L>
<L>And when I cry'd to men, no help I found:</L>
<L>There was a God in Heaven that heard my cry,</L>
<L>And lookt upon me with a gracious eye:</L>
<L>He that did pity <HI>Joseph</HI> in his grief,</L>
<L>Sent from above unto my soul relief:</L>
<L>He sent his Angels who did it conveigh</L>
<L>Into his Bosom, where poor <HI>Lazarus</HI> lay:</L>
<L>Let none presume to censure my estate,</L>
<L>As <HI>Job</HI> his Friends did stumble at his Fate.</L>
<L>All things on Earth do fall alike to all,</L>
<L>To good Disciples, which on God that call;</L>
<L>To those that do Blaspheme his Holy Name,</L>
<L>And unto those that reverence the same:</L>
<L>He that from nature drew me unto Grace,</L>
<L>And look'd upon me with a Fathers face:</L>
<L>When in my blood upheld me to the last,</L>
<L>And now I do of joyes eternal tast.</L>
<L>Remember how <HI>Job's</HI> precious children Dy'd,</L>
<L>As also what the Prophet <HI>did</HI> betide:<NOTE PLACE="marg"> <HI>Jonah</HI></NOTE></L>
<L>What was the end of good <HI>Josiah's</HI> life,</L>
<L>And how it fared with <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Wife:</L>
<L>Remember what a Death it was that Christ</L>
<L>(Suffered for me) the Darling of the highest;</L>
<L>His Death of Deaths hath quite remov'd the sting,</L>
<L>No matter how or where the Lord doth bring</L>
<L>Us to our end, in Christ who live and die</L>
<L>And sure to live with Christ eternally.</L>
