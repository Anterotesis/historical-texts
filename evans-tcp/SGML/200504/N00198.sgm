<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>BOth Scripture and experience hath made it manifest to the world, that a <HI>Religious Fast,</HI> when duly attended, is a Duty of no small importance and advantage to the people of God. But those spiritual performances, which if right|ly managed, are the most beneficial, have a special difficulty and contrariety to flesh and blood accompanying them. So is it an hard work to keep a <HI>Fast</HI> in such a manner, as that it shall become an ac|ceptable Day unto the Lord: whence also it cometh to pass, that ve|ry few even amongst those that outwardly observe Fasting Dayes, are acquainted with the inward, spiritual, &amp; acceptable part of the duty. There have been that as to what is external in such servi|ces regard not the divine precept; Some think the Prophet Isaiah (in that Chapter (which is partly and judiciously opened in the ensuing Sermon) reproveth Enormities in that kind. And although mercy is better then Sacrifice, nor may we urge any severities beyond what the word of God doth impose&punc; yet it is to be feared that many a|mongst us do not make due conscience of that outward abstinence which the rule, and which the nature of the duty doth require.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thes. Sal|mur part ult. Camero in Mat.</HI> 17.21. <HI>Ames Answ to Burgess. pt.</HI> 1. <HI>pag.</HI> 145.</NOTE> It is most true, that the Kingdome of God doth not consist in meat and drink; nor is Fasting in it self any part of Religion; when it is called worship, it is by a Trope, as being a special adjunct of some extraordinary worship yet for men to exact labours, or to find their own pleasures upon such daies, is an high transgression. Others there are, that as to externals will be very exact, nay, over-righteous. Whenas all that they do is before the Lord no better then loath|some formality &amp; hypocrisie. The Evangelist informs us that it was customary amongst the Jews to fast twice a week. And the Jewish <HI>ma|sters</HI> tell us particularly, that it was upon the 2<HI>d.</HI> and 5<HI>th.</HI> day of the week,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Volumen Je|junii, Fol.</HI> 54</NOTE> <HI>decreverunt magistry nostri utjejunaretur diebus secundo et quin|to, propter tres res, viz. propter destructum Templum, propter legem Con|flagratam, &amp; propter probrum divini nominis.</HI> In imitation of whom some Christians call two dayes of the week <HI>Fast dayes,</HI> albeit that they might not be thought to Judaize, they have not fixed upon the same dayes the Jews did.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thorndike of Servi. in Re<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 letter"> Assemb. c.</HI> 8</NOTE> But to what end is a multitude of these Oblati|ons,

if confided in? Do men think that their voice will be heard on high, <HI>h. e.</HI> that they shall have acceptance in Heaven meerly be|cause they fast; Certainly, if there be not serious preparation for such dayes, unfeigned Humiliation, and Contrition in them, Re|formation after them, dayes of Humiliation will become dayes of provocation&punc; before that God, who will never suffer himself to be mocked by any of the Sons of men. When the most solemn and extraordinary duties of Religion degenerate into Formality, it cau|seth the God of judgement to come near. Historians have ob|served, that <HI>Pompey</HI> seized upon the Temple on the Jews solemn Fasting day;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosephus de A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">tiq. Iude|or. l.</HI> 14. <HI>c.</HI> 8</NOTE> Also that upon one of their publick Fasts <HI>Sosius</HI> took <HI>Ierusalem</HI>; the Lord thereby testifying against the Formality of that degenerate generation. And indeed dayes of Humiliation without Reformation, are no other, nor no better then <HI>a Form of godliness without the power of it.</HI> So the formal Jews in <HI>Isaiahs</HI> time. Notwithstanding their frequent facts, they persisted in do|ing their own wills, (and are therefore said to <HI>find their own plea|sure</HI>) though contrary to the commanding will of God; They con|tinued to oppress,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Gata|ker Annot on Isai.</HI> 58.</NOTE> and exact Labours of those that by the Law of God should have been set at liberty, <HI>Ier.</HI> 34.17. Vexatious Law suits, (<HI>smiting with the fist of wickedness</HI>) and other Contentions were rise amongst them, after dayes of Humiliation; If a poor man were by any injurious Contract fallen into their hands they would not <HI>loose those Bonds of wickedness.</HI> The Lord therefore by his Prophet tells them&punc; that as ever they desired God should re|gard their Fasts, those prevailing iniquities should be reformed, and the contrary duties practised. To the same purpose <HI>Ieremiah</HI> upon a solemn Fasting day, <HI>Ier.</HI> 36.6, 7.</P>
<P>Now that the Lords people amongst us may be awakened and warned against resting in any lifeless Formalities, or in Humiliati|ons without Reformation, is the design of the Reverend and worthy Author in this practical and useful Sermon of his Discourses of this nature are never unseasonable since no Age passeth wherein there is not afforded matter &amp; ground sad enough to warrant the perfor|mance of the duty urged.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>New-Testament</HI> speaketh nothing for stated Fasts or Festivals,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tertullian de Iejun. Epiph. Hae|res.</HI> 75. <HI>Au|gust de He|res. c.</HI> 53</NOTE> <HI>Tertullian</HI> before his <HI>Montanisme</HI> wrote truly, that religi|ous Fasts are to be observed <HI>pro temporibus &amp; causis,</HI> as the Lord shall providentially call thereunto. Indeed <HI>Aerius</HI> was sometimes charged with Heresy, because he withstood the Imposition of those
<PB REF="000258_0004_0FA4110CE26CF148">
and the like Formalities, but that was in an Age when the dark|ness of Superstition began to over spread the Christian World. Ne|vertheless the word is clear, that at sometimes frequency in the ob|servation of this service ought to be attended, <HI>Iohns</HI> Disciples kept many dayes of Fasting and Prayer, probably (as a learned In|terpreter conceiveth) upon occasion of their Masters being Impri|soned, which providence was a sufficient call unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Grotius in Math.</HI> 9.14</NOTE> to be much in extraordinary seekings unto God, and Humiliation before him that (if possible) they might not be deprived of such a faithful and eminent Teacher. And although the tenderness of Christ to|ward his own Disciples was such as that he would not at first enjoyn frequent Fastings upon them who had not been accustomed to such severities, lest (as new wine is ungrateful, and will be rejected by those who have tasted that which is more Pleasant) being suddenly put upon precepts too strong for weak Disciples,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cradock Harmon. c.</HI> 3 <HI>Sect.</HI> 20.</NOTE> they should be discouraged; yet the Lord doth intimate that dayes of persecution and general affliction would at last befall them, when they should be providentially called (and their practice be suitable) unto fre|quent Fastings.</P>
<P>It is marvellous to consider (for his Spirit knoweth what shall come to pass in the world, and inclineth the hearts of his Messen|gers accordingly) how God many times causeth the words of his Servants in their publick Ministrations to fall in with his providen|tial dispensations; of which we have some Instance in the Sermon herewith emitted, which was delivered some years agoe, even a little before our late troubles. The Lord knew that <HI>Boston,</HI> yea, that <HI>New-England</HI> would have cause for many dayes of Humiliati|on, and therefore stirred up the heart of his Servant, before hand to give instructions and Directions concerning the acceptable per|formance of so great a duty. Some that were affected in hearing the Word preached, and that did in short hand take what was de|livered, have Importuned the Reverend Author to give way unto its publication unto whose desires he hath at last conceded. And I know not but that the publication of what is in this way presented may be as seasonable as the preaching of it at first was. For if my Conjectures fail not, the dayes are at hand when <HI>New-England</HI> will have as great cause as ever to attend Humiliations and suppli|cations before the most High. There is no general Reformation vi|sible in <HI>New-England,</HI> nor so much as an heart to comply with the Scripture expedient for that end We have seen the red Horse

The De|cree hath not as yet brought forth&punc; wherefore such a Fast as the Lord hath chosen, would be a blessed means to lengthen out our Tranquility; And O that <HI>New-England</HI> knew in this her day the things that belong to her peace.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Isaiah.</HI> 58.5, 6. Is it such a Fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his Soul, &amp;c. Is not this the Fast that I have chosen, &amp;c?</HEAD>
<P>IT is (my beloved) hard work yea, one of the hardest parts of the work of the Ministry, to awaken a people that are rocked a sleep in sin; especially a professing people, that are lifted up to emi|nent degrees in profession, exalted with great priviledges, and have their hearts raised with these things unto great pride, this (I say is a great and difficult work of the Ministry to awaken such: But such a People this Prophet had to do withal, and therefore you see what he must do, ver. 1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare not,</HI> stretch thy throat, spare no pains, <HI>lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and shew my people their transgressions, &amp; the house of</HI> Jacob <HI>their sins.</HI> They had Watchmen amongst them, but they did not watch; <HI>Dogs that did not bark,</HI> Isai. 56.10. and therefore the Prophet must <HI>cry aloud,</HI> and shew them their sins. Why? were they so vile a people? they were eminent in profession, exalted in priviledges, and arrogant in both, as appears in five or six things. 1. <HI>They seek me daily,</HI> ver 2. 2. <HI>They delight to know my wayes.</HI> 3. <HI>They did Righteousness,</HI> and they forsook not the Ordinances of God, they were a practicing People, as well as a knowing people, and further, they enquire and ask after the Ordinances of Justice, and profess great delight in approach|ing to God, and that not only in common and ordinary duties, but ex|traordinary, ver. 3. <HI>We have fasted, and we have afflicted our Souls in our Fast,</HI> and yet saith God to the Prophet: <HI>Cry aloud, spare not, life up thy voice like a Trumpet, and make them to know their transgressions</HI> &amp;c. They were yet a people that did need awakening notwithstanding all this.</P>
<P>But when was this people in this frame? and when was there such matter of complaint against them? I Answer in general, it was when they did keep hypocritical Fasts, which are here described, <HI>ver.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.4. &amp; they did Fast, but yet they did not Fast; It was a Fast (as to the exter|nal observation,) when it was not a Fast, as to the spiritual Efficacy and right performance of this holy Service. They were lifted up with their
<PB N="2" REF="000258_0007_0FA41113125D5AE0">
Service performed, and quarrelled with God, and complained, as if some notable injury were done them, in that they used Gods remedy for their malady, and yet their malady was not removed.</P>
<P>More porticularly. This seems to me to have reference to the dayes of <HI>Hezekiah</HI>; You knew what glorious dayes they were, and how zea|lous he was in Reformation, insomuch, that he brake in pieces the bra|zen Serpent which <HI>Moses</HI> had made which they had so long admired and burnt Incense to, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 18.4. and what solemn Fasts did they keep? and what delight had they in approaching unto God, 2 <HI>Cron.</HI> 30&punc;21. <HI>the Children of Israel that were present at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>kept the Feast of unleavened bread seven dayes, with great gladness, and the Priests and Levites praised the Lord, day by day, singing with loud Instruments unto the Lord.</HI> There was great joy; But alas as soon as these things were well over, and they had purged out Idolatry in <HI>Chap.</HI> 32.1. Af|ter these things, and the establishment thereof, <HI>Senacherib</HI> comes up a|gainst them, and their wound as to their Civil affairs is not healed. And in the sixth year of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> the ten Tribes are led away by <HI>Shalma|nezer,</HI> 2 <HI>King.</HI> 18.10. that is in the ninth year of <HI>Hoshea</HI> King of Israel. <HI>Sa|maria</HI> was taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &amp; because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his Covenant and all that <HI>Moses</HI> the ser|vant of the Lord commanded, and would not hear them nor do them. Now <HI>ver.</HI> the 13. <HI>In the fourteenth year of King</HI> Hezekiah <HI>Zenacherib took all the fenced Cities of</HI> Judah, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Here was Israel carried Cap|tive before, and did not <HI>Judah</HI> fast then in good <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> dayes? here also is <HI>Judah</HI> set upon, and the fenced Cities taken; and was <HI>He|zekiah,</HI> and the people asleep all this while? did they not fast and pray? yea, but in the issue <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is besieged, and <HI>Rabshekah</HI> blasphemes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was not here matter of fasting and prayer? yet notwithstand|ing all this <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is in danger of destruction, why then? <HI>wherefore have we fasted</HI> (say they) <HI>and thou seest it not? wherefore have we affli|cted our Soul, and thou takest no knowledge</HI>? here is their quarrel with God, and God Answers this in <HI>ver.</HI> 3.4. He gives (I say) the Reason of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. By discovering their sins that still remain notwithstanding their Fasts, so that their Fasts were indeed no Fasts.</P>
<P N="2">2. The benefits they should have obteined if their Fast had been a Fast indeed; <HI>Is it such a Fast as I have chosen for a man to afflict his Soul for a day, and to hang down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sack|cloths</HI>? &amp;c. oh no! but <HI>this is the Fast that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickdness, to undoe the heavy burthens, and to let the oppressed go</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000258_0008_0FA41114B6C61C28">Hence we may observe.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That a Fast of Gods chusing, or such a Fast as God hath chosen will certainly bring seasonable pledges of Gods gracious acceptation.</HI> When the heart is right for God, and the Fast is ordered according to God it shall certainly obtain mercy, and bring home help and succour from God. Prayer, especially, extraordinary prayer is not only the Key of all earthly Treasures of Goodness, which God hath laid up for the Sons of men on Earth, but the Key of heavenly Treasures in Christ Jesus also.</P>
<P>I shall observe this method in managing this Subject. 1. I shall o|pen unto you the nature of a Fast&punc; and such a Fast as God hath chosen.</P>
<P N="2">2. I shall shew you those Testimonies which God will give of his gracious acceptation unto such a Fast. 3. I shall endeavour to show you the seasons wherein God is wont to give&punc; and his people may ex|pect such manifest Testimonies of his gracious acceptation 4. I shall labour to help your Faith with some invincible Arguments and demon|strations of this Truth, and then the Reasons of the point, and Lastly, how much this concerns us, a people so Circumstanced as we are.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the nature of a Fast you may take this imperfect diffinition or description of it not taken strictly, only for an adjunct or means of worship, but more largely as I suppose in my Text, and so a Fast is an extraordinary part or act of Gospel worship wherein for a convenient Season we abstain from the comforts of this life, and upon due exami|nation of our wayes towards God, and consideration of Gods wayes towards us. We make a solemn and real profession that we justifie God and judge our selves&punc; we justifie God for the evil of affliction that we either feel or fear and judge our selves for the evil of transgression which we find within us or that hath passed from us, we solemnly pro|fess godly sorrow and repentance for the evil of sin, we solemly pro|fess that we seek mercy and grace from God in Jesus Christ to save us from our sins and sorrows, we solemnly profess that we with all readi|ness forgive others that have offended us, as we hope to be forgiven of God, and lastly we solemnly engage and bind our selves to reform the evil of our wayes&punc; and to walk before God in new obedience ac|cording to his word for the time to come. There is much of Reli|gion lyes in the right understanding of a Spiritual Fast&mdash;Therefore I say first [a Fast&punc;]</P>
<P>The very notion of a Fast speaks abstinence, a Fast is that wherein a man denyes himself the use of ordinary things whereto he is accusto|med and necessitated for some certain ends and for a certain season;
<PB N="4" REF="000258_0009_0FA41115288421A0">
if there be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> denying your selves ordinary comforts&punc; there is no Fast, and if not in order to worship, it is not a religious Fast. And therefore though this be but an adjunct of worship, yet its an adjunct appointed by God to abstein from your ordinary comforts, and that in three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To abstain from meat and drink wholly, if strength of nature will bear it, if not, so much as mercy and necessity will permit</HI>; This at least is com+manded of old, <HI>Esth.</HI> 4.16. neither eat nor drink three dayes, night nor day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> she appointed a three dayes Fast, which those Countries might better bear, and upon that extraordinary occasion they might not eat nor drink, night nor day, so <HI>Nineveh</HI> they must not eat nor drink, they are forbidden not only wine, but water, <HI>Jonah.</HI> 3 7.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>It is a part of the abstinence requisite to this duty, to abstein from our wonted Ornaments.</HI> To adorn the body in the day of Fast is a trans|gression of the Rule of fasting, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.4, 5, 6. there they are com|manded to put off their Ornaments, and they were wonte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> also to cloath themselves in Sackcloth, now the rigour of this according to the darkness of those shadowing times is not exacted from us; yet there is a proportion to be observed. The King of <HI>Niniveh</HI> (though but the King of <HI>Niniveh</HI> and not the King of <HI>Israel</HI>) yet he layes aside his Robes and put on Sackcloth, and that was a prevailing Fast, for it was a self humbling Fast. And they were wont also to sprinkle dust and ashes upon their heads, and to express all manner of self despisings and self abomination. If you be loth to put off your Ornaments, then its an humbling, and if it be an humbling, you ought to abstein from them with other your ordinary comforts, in an extraordinary humili|ation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>An absteining from all your lustful Employments and sports, and re|creations,</HI> yea, even the pleasures of a Married life&punc; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.5. <HI>Joel</HI> 2.26. Let the Bridegroom come out of his Chamber&punc; and the Bride out of her Closet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there must be no sport nor pastimes. In a word, such abstinence is required wherby the body may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.3 <HI>Lev.</HI> 23, 29.30. and <HI>Dan.</HI> 10.2, 3, 12. <HI>Ezra.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.21. And this abstinence must continue at least from Evening to Evening, for so must you keep the Sabbaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not only your weekly Sabbaths, but Fasting and Feasting Sabbaths, <HI>Lev.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">2. <HI>from Evening to Evening shall you cele|brate your Sabbath</HI>&punc; Its a vain shift to say this is spoken concerning Sabbaths only upon special occasions, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> weekly Sabbaths, <HI>Lev.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">3.2, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. and these also.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="000258_0010_0FA41115EB9D0618">2, Now this very outward abstinence as as help to the worship in the day, and so the whole Fast is a Gospel duty, that is, it is a duty di|rected unto, under the Covenant of grace, and not apperteining to the Covenant of works; for the Covenant of works did not admit of any day of Atonement: But it is the Gospel that appoints dayes of Atone|ment, and it is required in the Gospel, as our Saviour saith, <HI>when the Bridegroom is absent the Children of the Bride-Chamber shall Fast,</HI> the Bridegroom is Christ, and the Children are Believers under the Gos|pel&punc; and when he is absent, that is in Heaven, before he returns again there shall be times of Fasting&punc; <HI>Math.</HI> 9 15. <HI>Can the Children of the Bride-Chamber mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, but the dayes shall come that he shall be taken from them, and then they shall Fast,</HI> and the Apostle gives direction how they should manage themselves in Fasting and Prayer, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7 5. and therefore its a Gospel duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. But yet (though a Gospel duty) it is an extraordinary duty, fasting is not an every weeks duty in a constant Course, as the Pharise thought, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.12. saying, <HI>I Fast twice a week.</HI> God hath appoint|ed six dayes for labour, and one for a Sabbath&punc; and therefore for men to appoint to themselves constant Sabbaths, besides the Sabbath of the Lord, is will-worship, and not acceptable to God. This then is not for Ordinary but special occasions, as first when there is some notable or eminent publick Danger, as in the dayes of <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; So when some notable duty is to be performed which is very diffi|cult and hazardous, then is a season for a Fast as it was with <HI>Esther,</HI> Chap. 4&punc;14 15&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</P>
<P>Again, when there is some great sickness lying upon those that are near and dear unto us, Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">5.1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 14. <HI>But as for me, when they were s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">k my clothing was sackcloth, I humbled my Soul with Fasting, and I behaved my self as though he had been my friend or brother, I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.</HI> A friend and brother or Mother, or near Relations&punc; when they are sick and weak and in dan|gerous condition, it calls for Fasting, there is then opportunity and occasion for this duty.</P>
<P>Again, when there is some notable blessing wanting, or we are in danger to loose it: And so when a person or people are fallen under some great transgression, whereby God may be provoked to indigna|tion against them, its a time of Fasting and mourning&punc; thus <HI>Ezra.</HI> 9.4, 5, 6. in the case of their marrying strange wives, and polluting the holy seed. So when God goes forth against a people in some notable calamity, or threatning judgment, as when Israel fled before the ene|my&punc;

<P N="2">2. Concerning the spiritual performance of it, and here first in order to the preparation thereto&punc; There is examination of our own wayes&punc; and consideration of the works of God; these are preparatory, and for want of these it is that mens hearts are utterly indisposed to such spiritual services: <HI>Josh&punc;</HI> 7&punc; v 6. to 12&punc; <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.38. to 44. in which you find them considering and bewailing both their own sins, and Gods Judgments upon them for sin.</P>
<P>The next thing to be shown, is the very work of a Fast in the very na|ture of it, and so I call it a real Profession, to distinguish between an acceptable and an unacceptable Fast; I say it is a solemn &amp; real profes|sion. This people professed great delight in Gods Ordinances and sought the Lord daily and that they did and would cleave to God in his appointments&punc; They enquire after his mind, they make great profession and so exact were they in their Fasts, that they afflicted their souls and bowed down their heads like a bulrush, and walked mournfully and spread sackcloth and ashes under them, and what could be more as to an outward profession? but their hearts were not ingaged in it it was but a Lye a flattering of God, as <HI>Psal&punc;</HI> 78.34 35, 36, 37. therfore God upbraids them saying, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> <HI>Fast that I have chosen</HI>? But particularly,</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> There is a profession of our justifying God, for the evil of affli|ction that he brings upon us, and a condemnation of our selves for the evill of our transgressions against the Lord our God. Thus <HI>Dan.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.7. <HI>O Lord, Righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto unconfusion of face, as at this</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>v.</HI> 5, 8&punc; 16. they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> righteousness to God, though he had laid waste Jerusalem burnt the city destroyed the tem|ple, scattered the people, and made them captives, yet saith Daniel, <HI>Thou art righteous and we have sinned</HI>&punc; So Ezra makes a solemn&punc; and heart-breaking prayer, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9&punc; 6&punc; <HI>My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> God for our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are increased over our head, and our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A solemn profession of godly sorrow and repentance of the evil of transgression which we have committted against the Lord. <HI>Joel.</HI> 2.
<PB N="7" REF="000258_0012_0FA4111821EE9988">
12.13&punc; <HI>Neh.</HI> 9. They confess their sins from the beginning of their being a people; and lay such a load upon themselves, as might make their hearts heavy with godly sorrow.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is a solemn profession that we fly for refuge, to the hope of grace and mercy that is set before us in the Atonement made by Jesus Christ.</HI> Thus <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 12.15, 16. he upon that occasion laments the plague of his heart, and the wickedness of his fact and laments after the blood of Christ for cleansing, and cries out for a new Creation of his heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.10. <HI>Create in me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me,</HI> this is the profession of every one that Fasts that he flies for refuge, to the precious blood of Christ for mercy to save him from his sin and Gods judgements, that he may have peace and grace no more to re|turn unto folly.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Again, there is a solemn profession in Fasting and Prayer, that we forgive others, as we desire to be forgiven of God,</HI> Mark. 11.25. when ye stand praying forgive, if you have ought against any, that your Fa|ther also which is in Heaven may forgive your Trespasses; Therefore in this Text he convinceth them by want of this, not to fast aright, <HI>Ye fast for strife and debate,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isai.</HI> 58.4. They did not heal but streng|then their divisions by fasting and their Fasts were hypocritical, and not according to their profession.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>There is in it a solemn profession,</HI> that we bind our selves to re|form what is amiss, and to walk with God in new obedience, especially when you come to God in a solemn way and manner, its a true obser|vation concerning prayer, that you can put no Petition to God for mercy but it implies a promise unto God of new obedience, especially when you come to God in such a solemn way and manner, you either come that you may obtain help for, or against your sin, help to obey, or to continue in obedience in every Fast there is an implicite making and renewing Covenant with God, which the Saints of God upon these more then ordinary occasions were wont to express; <HI>Neh&punc;</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI> the last verse and the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Chapter, so that in a Fast you solemnly profess that you are grieved for your Transgressions and seek his grace in Christ&punc; to pardon and heal you, and that all your hope is in the Atonement of Jesus Christ and that you freely forgive all that have trespassed against you laying aside <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wrath, malice, en|vy, evil speaking, and whatsoever may be the fruits of such displicen|cy of Spirit against others, you profess that you put the thoughts of these from you, as you desire your sins should be put away from Gods sight, and you engage not to walk in the former course of iniquity,
<PB N="8" REF="000258_0013_0FA4111920339760">
but that you will set upon it, to do the will of God in all duties accord|ing to the Rules of new obedience, its but a mocking of God, <HI>a flatter|ing of him with your lips, a lying unto him with your Tongues,</HI> if your Spi|rits be not thus disposed and inclined in such a solemn duty. There|fore further to distinguish, there is a Fast that God hath chosen, and a fast that he hath not chosen, <HI>Is this the Fast that God hath chosen, to hang down the head like a Bulrush for a day</HI>? &amp;c. and is this all that God requires, to put on a sad face and sad Clothes, and sad thoughts for a day, or to fetch a sigh or two in your Closets, and pray in your Fami|lyes, and go to the publick worship, and when the day is over to be as you were before, not making Conscience of answering the expectation justly raised upon your profession, but the proud is proud still, and the filthy is filthy still? this is not the Fast which God hath chosen, if you will shew me your Fasts, where are the fruits thereof? but sin is getting ground upon us notwithstanding our Fasts, Schisme, Heresy, Envy, Malice, and strife notwithstanding your Fasts, and all our dayes of Atonement they prevail not to consume, wast and destroy these abomi|nations out of the Land, these are not the Fasts which God hath chosen; Gods Fasts will break the heart for sin and from sin; But your Fasts keep the heart whole, and the life of sin whole within you, never look for a tender heart, if you can but fast away the sense of your sin, and sorrow for sin, &amp; your care &amp; diligent endeavours to walk with God. My heart akes to think of the unfruitful Fasts that are amongst us as to the body of this people, though I know there are precious Souls a|mongst us that mourn for these things.</P>
<P>But ah <HI>New-England, New-England</HI>! how wilt thou be able to bear the burthen of thy Fasts? There is not a Soul that hears me but fasts either the Fast that God hath chosen, or that he hath not chosen. You doe fast, and therefore this is your profession&punc; that you are sensible of the displeasure of God hanging over your heads, and that you are for|ty with all your hearts that you have provoked God; this is the pro|fession of your actions, or else what do you here? You profess that you doe with all your heart entertain motions of love and kindness, where there hath been strife; and doe profess you forgive them, as God hath forgiven you&punc; and that your hearts are full of compassion to afflicted ones, and that your hands shall be open to relieve them ac|cording to your ability Can any of your souls come to seek mercy from God, and have your hearts shut up against the poor and needy, without great hypocrisie? How doe your hearts work toward those things? Consider it in the fear of God&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000258_0014_0FA41119A2057CE8"><HI>Q. What is the Fast which God hath chosen?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is when the heart is sincerely and intirely carried forth in a holy Conformity to that which the duty makes profession of <HI>my Son give me thy heart</HI> sayes God, God cares not for external performances without the heart, <HI>they are but as the cutting off a Dogs neck, &amp;c.</HI> Isa 66 8. It is an high abomination when you come without a suitable heart to a day of Humiliation. There are four things which show a suitable heart to a day of Humiliation,</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> When the soul comes with brokenness &amp; contrition of heart, when a holy trembling seizes upon such a man; when he draws nigh, lest he provoke God, and procure his indignation, a broken heart and contrite spirit begins the day, and goes along through the day, when the spirit is indeed suited to the duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a penitent self abasement before God in and by the du|ty. These Jews (that is the false-hearted amongst them, though there were some among them that were upright) they quarrel with God, <HI>wherefore have we fasted</HI> say they, <HI>and thou seest not</HI>: but the sincere soul is humbled in the acknowledgment of this, That it were a just and righteous thing with God to cast away his prayers and servi|ces; for God owes him nothing <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there is a strong and firm re|solution, that (the Grace of God assisting) he will no more return un|to vanity.</P>
<P N="3">3 In a Fast that God hath chosen, the soul defers not, nor delayes nor puts off the doing of that work which concerns it to promote the end of its Fasting: You draw nigh to God&punc; that your hearts and wayes may be reformed; do you doe it forthwith. The delaying soul, that is putting off his Reformation and Renovation, doth not keep such a Fast as God hath chosen. If it be not time for you to doe your du|ty, it is time for you to suffer affliction. If it be not time for you to carry on a thorow Reformation, it's time for God to carry on your sorrows and afflictions toward your desolation. These delaying souls do not keep a Fast unto God, when you resolve a Fast&punc; you must re|solve to begin and prosecute this work of turning unto God that very day, and carry it on to the end.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> A Fast which God hath chosen alwayes leaves a warm im|pression of love one towards another, and to all mankind as God gives opportunity. Oh when you have tasted mercy from God, how merci|full will it make you to be to others. Therefore when men are hard-hearted, cruel and harsh&punc; and their spirits not inclined to mercy, they have been very little with God to what they ought to be.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="000258_0015_0FA4111CD1745A70">Again, Why is this called the Fast which God hath chosen?</P>
<P>I answer briefly.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because that such a Fast doth exactly answer the coun|sel of Gods will about it, which he had eternally in himself and which he gives forth to us in his holy Word, &amp; therefore it is referred to its first pattern and exemplar unto the will and choyce of God.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Its a Fast that God hath chosen, because God prefers this above any other kind of Fast: There are Fasts many, but this God pre|fers above all: There are Fasts which obtain some answer from God, yet are not like these. You know what Ahab obtained from God by fasting, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 21 27, 28, 29. God had respect to his Fasting and humbling himself, and Ahab obtained a Reprieve thereby, so that the Judgment threatned was not executed in his dayes; but yet Ahab did not fast with such a Fast as God hath chosen, and delights in, and ac|cepts of.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because God takes pleasure and hath a gracious respect to his people in it, and after it, the service is acceptable to him when it is a day he hath chosen, and it ascends as the offering of a sweet smelling Sacrifice: this is noted in that the other is not an accepted day to the Lord, but this is a day wherein God takes pleasure in Heaven if there be joy in Heaven when one sinner is converted, how much more when a whole Congregation is thus doing, to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit, <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.2. how much more when it is thus with a people.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 4. He will take his own time to manifest his own gracious ac|ceptation of his people in such a Fast. You are not presently answer|ed (you'l say) as you expected. Be it so, Remember your time is al|wayes, but Christs hour is not yet come, <HI>but he that shall come, will come and will not tarry,</HI> beyond his own time to Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> II. We are come in the second place to consider what those spiritual or outward benefits are, whereby the Lord is wont to mani|fest his gracious acceptation of such a Fast; And in general you may take it as a certain Truth that when God is pleased to Answer the prayers of his people, he testifies his acceptation thereof, but more particularly, there are three things whereby God discovers his accep|tance of such a day as this is.</P>
<P N="1">1. When he gives them a praying and fasting frame of Spirit, such a frame as he requires, for this is not in mans power, but it is the gift of Gods grace when <HI>God prepares the heart of the humble, he also hears their Cry,</HI> Psal. 10.17. when God causes your hearts and your Tongues to
<PB N="11" REF="000258_0016_0FA4111E56C7E4D8">
pray, he will certainly cause his ear to hear; for he is the Hearer of Prayer. Prayer is a gift of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26. <HI>We know not how to pray, but the spirit helps our infirmities,</HI> and God knowes the meaning of the spirit in us. When a man prayes by his own spirit, his own spirit is under his own command, and therefore he is uniform in his Prayer he is not sometimes straightned, and sometimes enlarged, except it be through the distempers of his Body, or the like: but when a man prayes by Gods Spirit, there are some strange out-goings of the heart in prayer, which no mortal is able to command, such enlargedness of heart, such desires after Christ and his grace, such affliction for sin, &amp; earnest longing for deliverance, as no man can possibly command in his own heart&punc; and when God gives such a Spirit, it's an argument of his gracious acceptation. It's a day of Humiliation, when God gives you an humble spirit; it's a day of Abstinence, when God puts into thy heart an earnest desire of divorcement from all sin how pleasant and profitable soever: this is a pledge of Gods gracious acceptation ac|cording to that promise, Isai. 65.24. <HI>before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When God gives an heart, after fasting and Prayer to put in ex|ecution that which concerns our selves in order to the obtaining our spi+ritual requests &amp; supplications presented unto God: that is when there is a reforming spirit, a purifying spirit, a watchful spirit against sin, when the soul sets himself with more watchfulness &amp; industry to the work of the Lord; and so a people, as in <HI>Nehe.</HI> 10. the whole Chapter, and the last Chap. of <HI>Ezra,</HI> after their humiliation, how active were they for a thorow Reformation, when Church and Court and all in their places endeavour the removal of sin, and making up the breach between God and them, it is a certain demonstration that God is near at hand to Answer them.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a marvellous gracious Argument of our acceptation with God when he gives in any of those spiritual or outward blessings which are here mentioned in the Text, there are eight glorious priviledges here engaged to such a person or people, 1. Light after darkness&punc; <HI>v.</HI> 8. and 10. <HI>then shall thy Light break forth as the morning, and thy Light shall arise in obscurity, and thy darkness shall be as the noon day,</HI> &amp;c. when God gives a poor Soul Light after darkness, and Light in obscurity breaking forth as the morning, this is a great benefit. Light signifies not only the inlightning of the understanding, or quickning you with spiritual Light, but all kind of help and consolation, and prosperity, and so darkness signifies all kind of affliction, whether it be sense of sin,
<PB N="12" REF="000258_0017_0FA41120192B5C00">
or other sorrows, or the like. There are four things in this.</P>
<P>First it is Light in darkness when you see darkness hath covered your Souls that you have not known what your state &amp; condition hath been, and thereupon hath been great affliction and Agony of Soul, and there hath been also great afflictions outwardly, as commonly one af|fliction goes not alone, or when there hath been distress upon a people, and now God causes Light to spring after darkness some glimpses of hope, some raisings up of your Spirits and expectation of good dayes, some comfortable changes of providence, as <HI>Paul</HI> was comforted by the coming of <HI>Titus</HI> which he ascribed to Gods comforting of him, this is Light after darkness.</P>
<P N="2">2. When this Light that is promised is gradual like the Light of the morning that <HI>shines more and more unto the perfect day</HI> you must not say there is no Light because it is not noon at first, if it be but the dawning of the day, or the Light of the morning star, you have cause to acknow|ledge it as an Answer of Prayers, if it do but foreshow the beginning of your return from spiritual Captivity&punc; or outward calamity, you are to acknowledge it as a springing Light which shall go on to the perfect day in full perfection of glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a prevailing and overcoming Light, it may be weak at first, and obscured through clouds of darkness and temptation, but it shall be victorious and overcoming at the last.</P>
<P>Lastly, this Light is from the <HI>rising of the Sun of Righteousness,</HI> God will manifest his gracious acceptation to your Souls when <HI>the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings</HI>&punc; Mal. 4.2. that is, be it Light in Ordinances, or Light in providences it is still a Light from the face of Jesus Christ, there is something of Christ in it, there are com|mon refreshings that shine upon men which do not exalt Christ in the Soul but that saving Light that comes from Christ&punc; leads unto Christ, and makes Christ most precious and most glorious unto the Soul, now this is the Light God promises, whereby he will testifie his gracious acceptation of those that keep the <HI>Fast which he hath chosen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Thy health shall spring forth speedily, that is, when God is pleased to make Fastings healings, now this is his promise here, heal|ing of your Souls, of your Families, of your Churches of your common|wealths, healing to your affairs&punc; inward and outward&punc; spiritual and worldly, there is some kind of healing still, that God is wont to give forth in the Answer of the Prayers of his poor people.</P>
<P N="3">3. When your Righteousness shall go before you, and the Lord shall guide you continually, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. and 11. if it be a <HI>Fast that God hath
<PB N="13" REF="000258_0018_0FA4112065628A98">
chosen,</HI> this will be the fruit of it, and what is this Righteousness? the last expression openeth the first, <HI>Jehovah your Righteousness shall go be|fore you, and the glory of the Lord shall be your Rereward</HI> for it hath refe|ference to Gods conduct of Israel thorow the wilderness&punc; God went before them in the pillar of Cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, and in time of danger the Angel removed and went behind them as at the Red Sea, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.19, 20. So that <HI>their Righteousness</HI> was the Lord in the Cloud. They were a people full of all manner of iniqui|ty, perverseness and Rebellion, Ay, but sayes God, <HI>I have seen no ini|quity in Jacob, nor perverssness in Israel,</HI> Jehovah went before them as a God pardoning iniquity, transsgression and sin, and so he proclaims his Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34. and 7. he had never lead them through the wil|derness, but that as their Righteousness he went before them, so when God accepts you graciously, through the Righteousness of his Son Christ Jesus and so goes before you, this is a benefit whereby he mani|fests his gracious acceptation, and the phrase signifies three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he goes before you to seek a place of rest for you, and so our Lord Jesus Christ is gone before us to Heaven for that end, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">b.</HI> 6 20 whether the Forerunner is, for us entred, even Jesus. When you see that the Lord Jesus hath gone before you&punc; and hath born affliction for you though he was holy and righteous&punc; he hath born the curse and dyed for you, and rose again, and ascended into Heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he is gone to prepare your rest <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.2. <HI>I go to prepare a place for you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He goes before you in his word, guiding you in the way where|in you ought to follow him, that you also may attain to rest&punc; and thus he did to Israel in the wilderness, when God sends forth his Light and his Truth to inform your understandings, and bows your hearts to o|bedience according to that proportion of spiritual Light manifested, then he goes before you as your Righteousness.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the Lord goes before you to secure the way unto you as the <HI>great Captain of your Salvation,</HI> he leads you as he did Israel, into <HI>Canaan,</HI> Josh. 5.13, 14, 15 the Lord Jesus goes before you as the <HI>Cap|tain of your Salvation.</HI> This you shall obtain at the Lords hand when you Fast such a Fast as he hath chosen, <HI>and he will tread your Enemies under your feet shortly,</HI> the Devil, and the world, and what ever else. And so for a common wealth in time of war, if they fast sincerely&punc; he will go before them and make their way victorious, and their end Tri|umphant, <HI>Jehoshaphats</HI> Fast brought them to the Valley of Blessing, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.6.26.</P>
<P N="4">4. He will also be your Rereward, <HI>ve.</HI> 8. that signifies the gathering Host that comes after the rest of the Army, to gather up the weak, and
<PB N="14" REF="000258_0019_0FA4112124D6E0B0">
the feeble. And those that are not able to secure themselves&punc; this is called the gathering Host, as in the March of Israel through the wil|derness, there was the tribe of Dan, they were the gathering host, <HI>Numb.</HI> 2 <HI>v.</HI> 25. to the 31. and this is that which David refers to <HI>Psal.</HI> 27.10. <HI>When my Father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.</HI> When thy own heart shall fail, and all succour from friends and thine expectations are cut off from creature helps, then the Lord will gather you up&punc; you are fatherless or widows, or the like, that is in such or such a case of affliction, or under temptations, and you can|not resist them and the Devil sets upon you with mighty force, and you cannot obtain help from any other, in such a case, when you fast the Fast that God hath chosen, God himself will be your Rereward, he will come between you and the enemy. <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.19&punc; 20. <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. He will satisfie your souls in drought, and make fat your bones and you shall be like a watered garden, <HI>&amp;c. v.</HI> 11. A time of drought is a time of general want of rain and thereupon follows, not only want of water, as in Ahabs dayes, but want of food also; now in this time of drought God promises to satisfie your souls &amp; to make you as a water|ed garden; that is, whatsoever wants &amp; necessityes have been or may be feared to come upon a person or people&punc; yet when they fast <HI>the Fast which God hath chosen, he will satisfie their souls in drought&punc; &amp; make fat their bones,</HI> alluding to Gods dealing with Israel in the wildnrness, in giving them water out of the Rock, &amp; Manna from heaven which was not only food &amp; water for their bodyes, but spiritual food and water for their souls: so God will deal out a sufficient supply of all that good that is needfull for soul or body in this present life. <HI>Psal</HI> 33 19. <HI>To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in Famine.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 He will make your soul as a watered garden, and as a spring of water, whose waters fail not: <HI>As a watered Garden,</HI> that is, you shall be inclosed, and secured from them that might spoil your roots or your fruits, or that might make any sad and wofull impression upon your foundation, in matters of civil policy, or personal considerations, and you shall not be barren or unprofitable in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. A Fast which God hath chosen, is the way to all fruitfulness in all precious fruits like to the garden inclosed, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.12. And lest you should fear scarcity after this sayes God, <HI>They shall be as a living spring of water, whose waters fail not,</HI> Joh. 4.14. <HI>the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water spring|ing up into Everlasting Life,</HI> you shall have springing supplies of out|ward and spiritual consolation as the matter may require, and when I
<PB N="15" REF="000258_0020_0FA41121EDD78CC8">
say consolation, I intend the ground of it as well as the sense of it, that is such supplies of grace, &amp; seasonable knowledg of those supplies, that you shall not but acknowledg in them Gods everlasting loving kindnes</P>
<P N="7">7. There shall be a blessing to your posterity as well as to your selves, <HI>ver.</HI> 12, and there are three things in it, 1. They shall build the old wasts, this wilderness for ought I know hath lain waste from the beginning, and there were never a Civillized people here before, now fasting and prayer is the way to build the old wasts of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Isra|el.</HI> 2. <HI>Thou shalt raise up the Foundations of many gnnerations,</HI> that is, thou, &amp; thy seed. 3. <HI>Thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in,</HI> many breaches are made in Churches and in common wealth and upon mens Souls, many breaches upon the visible Church of God in the world, who are they that shall repair such breaches? those that observe such a Fast, as God hath chosen and the restorer of paths to dwell in in the times of confusion, &amp; those hurries that are a|mongst men about the matters of Religion people loose their paths, and know not how to order their wayes before him to gracious accep|tation; you that Fast with <HI>the Fast which God hath chosen,</HI> God will ma|nifest his gracious acceptation of you by making you and your posteri|ty Instruments to hold forth the wayes of God clearly, wherein poor Souls may walk with God, and find peace unto their Souls.</P>
<P N="8">8. Again in the last verse then shalt thou delight thy self in the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are three things in it&punc; &amp; the sum of all is that such a Fast as God hath chosen shall be powerful and effectual to bring you to the highest happiness; for first, you shall delight your selves in the Lord, you shall have God for your chiefest good, and he will be your portion to all Eternity. 2. You shall ride upon the high places of the Earth, you that are trodden down, shall have a time of Exaltation in a Kingdome that cannot be shaken, and thou shalt be fed with the heritage of <HI>Jacob</HI> thy Father, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, that is, after all your sorrows and troubles, you shall find still that God is your feeder, and that not with common food, but Jacobs heri|tage, which was threefold, 1. The blessings necessary for this life.</P>
<P N="2">2. The blessings necessary for his precious Soul the feeding Ordi|nances of God, and 3. The Eternal feeding which is promised at the glorious appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.17. <HI>the Lamb shall feed them and shall lead them unto living Fountains of water, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</HI> are not these glorious privi|ledges and admirable advantages? these are the special favours of God, whereby in due time he will manifest his gracious acceptation of his
<PB N="16" REF="000258_0021_0FA41122A2AF3620">
people, in their fastings and prayers which have been such as himself hath chosen. And thus we have seen the second general point pro|posed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next thing is to show the season when God delights to be|gin to give in the manifestation of his gracious acceptation of his peo|ple: It is true, the Seasons God hath reserved in his own power, and therefore we cannot tell you the day, Moneth or year&punc; but yet there are certain signs that are wont to be Forerunners of Gods gracious manifestations. Therefore,</P>
<P>I shall give you some general Characters for help of your faith and raising up your expectations as first, when the evil of affliction hath done its work, it may be God holds you long under some spiritual tem|ptation, or outward pressure, you are as a Sheaf in threshing upon the Floor, you have stroke after stroke hardly ever free from Tribulation, yet be content, when affliction hath done its work God will call it back, this was the Centurions Faith, <HI>Math.</HI> 8.9 afflictions came not forth without <HI>a God from God,</HI> and as <HI>it hath its Go</HI> from God, so it hath its Commission, it hath <HI>a wise work to do, its Do this</HI> also, now when it hath done its work it shall have <HI>its Come,</HI> it shall be called off again. As he afflicts you for your profit so when the end is attained, the affliction shall be removed, It is to make you partaker of his holiness; see then how the work of God prospers in your Souls, under tryals, afflictions and Temptations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When your hearts are quickned to urgent importunity for the blessing on the affliction, you may cry mightily for deliverance from evills felt or feared, these and those distresses that are upon you; but are your souls wrestling with God importunately for the blessing, as Jacob, <HI>I will not let thee goe except thou bless me.</HI> Its not the removing of the rod, but the giving in of the blessing that may refresh thee, is it the blessing that thy soul is crying for, certainly God will answer such prayers, as Jacob, after his earnest wrestling with God, sees the face of God in the face of his brother Esau.</P>
<P N="3">3. When your souls are ready to fail for thirst. In all the exerci|ses and trials of Gods people, God still hath a tender care to prevent this sad inconvenience, Isa. 57.16. <HI>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwayes wroth, for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made</HI>: Hence David useth this as an argument, <HI>Hear me speedily, my spirit doth fail.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. When the enemy is most insolent and violent. If the storm be high and terrible, ordinarily it is not durable, the gust will soon
<PB N="17" REF="000258_0022_0FA41123B55E1818">
blow over&punc; When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard against him. <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.19. God himself will interpose and ingage for your souls, his spirit against your spiritual adversaryes, and the wonders of his providence against your outward enemies. <HI>When he saw that there was none to help, then his own arm brought salvation</HI>; when they seem to be under the power of the enemy then it's time for God to work for their deliverance. God will ap|pear (I say)</P>
<P N="5">5. When you are come to a desperate Stand, you must have help or perish; you have already suffered Ship-wrack and are in the midst of the Flood, in the midst of the fiery furnace, in the lions den, having received the sentence of death in your selves, now is the time to trust in the living God who quickneth the dead. <HI>In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> That which is most comfortable, when your soul is brought to a quiet and patient submission to the hand and dispensation of God, committing your selves to his soveraign pleasure and waiting pati|ently for his salvation, certainly your deliverance is near. This is a great mystery whilst a soul is strugling against providence, and is displeased with Gods dispensation towards it, there is cause to fear that deliverance is far off; but when it comes to submit delive|rance is near, and pledges of Gods favour are at hand. 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.26. <HI>If I shall find favour in the sight of the Lord,</HI> saith David, <HI>he will bring me back again; but if he say, I have no delight in thee, behold here am I, let him doe to me what seemeth good unto him.</HI> Now David is not far from deliverance, when he is content that God should fullfill his own pleasure upon him whatsoever it be; and that this is the method that God is wont to observe in the way of his providence towards his people, the Apostle tells you, Rom. 5.3, 4&punc; <HI>Tribulation worketh Pati|ence, and Patience, experience, and experience hope, which maketh not a|shamed.</HI> It's a mistake in the mystery of providence, to look for ex|perience of mercy in deliverance, before the work of patience in self-resignation to the will of God. Thus of the 3<HI>d.</HI> thing.</P>
<P N="4">4. The next general Head is to demonstrate to your Faith&punc; that such a Fast as is of Gods chusing shall have such an issue. This is hard to believe in times of temptation, therefore need we to bottome our Faith well, upon such a foundation that cannot fail. I shall mention these,</P>
<P N="1">1 That if God should fail to manifest his acceptance of his people upon this account, then these and those that are under the powerfull
<PB N="18" REF="000258_0023_0FA4112439355AF0">
command of seeking his face, should seek his face in vain; but saith God <HI>I have not said to the seed of Jacob, seek ye my face in vain,</HI> Isa. 45.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. The gracious promises that are before us are a sufficient security that a Fast that God hath chosen, shall bring such gracious acceptati|on; as those eight promises mentioned, and also Psal. 50.15. <HI>Call upon me on the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</HI> And so, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 8.38. with many other verses before and after: and Christ himself also promiseth, that whatsoever ye shall ask in his name he will do it for you <HI>&amp;c. John.</HI> 14 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. The manner of Gods dealing with his servants establisheth this truth unto us, Psal. 119.132.133. <HI>&amp;c. Be mercifull unto me, as thou usest to doe to those that love thy name.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That God doth not suffer the Fastings and the Prayers of others when they are hearty&punc; though not spiritual, to goe without their re|ward. The young Ravens shall not cry unto him, but he will take care of them; he respects a very Ahab that sold himself to work wick|edness in the sight of the Lord, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 21.25. and yet <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his dayes.</HI> And so when Nineveh humbled themselves, he saved them from destructi|on though it was against the very grain of the soul of Jonah. <HI>Jon.</HI> 3.10</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> It must needs be so, because there is nothing stands in the way to hinder it. A Fast that God hath chosen removes all impedi|ments that stand in the way of mercy, the great obstruction is some sin committed, or some habitual impenitency remaining, for when the heart is truly humbled and broken, the soul is prepared for some de|gree of mercy, wherein the acceptation of the Suppliant may be made manifest. Thus of the fourth general Head.</P>
<P N="5">V. The next thing is the Reason why God will do thus for his people, upon their fasting the Fast which God hath chosen?</P>
<P>I answer 1. Negatively, not for any inherent excellency in their fastings and prayers, or services, for what benefit hath God by our humbling our selves, laying aside our Ornaments, &amp; so humbling our bodies, or by our diligent attention to external actions, but posi|tively I shall give you three reasons of it.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because it is a Fast that he hath chosen, and therefore it is so succesfull: were it of mans chusing, it might be disappointed, and yet God not dishonoured; but he chuseth it and appoints it, and now Gods honour lyes at stake for a gracious answer. It was the glory of God in Israel, to be manifestly near to that people in all they called upon him for. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000258_0024_0FA41125C7133FB0"><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because the persons are accepted (if such persons) and there|fore their offerings are accepted also. The Petition of a favourite is not easily rejected by the Prince, especially being such a Petition as his Prince hath chosen and appointed for him. They are in a state of favour with God&punc; and therefore their Petitions must needs be successful. The spiritual Sacrifices of this royal holy Priesthood are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because there is an admirable&punc; misterious Communion be|tween God the Father, Son and holy Ghost, and the right Suppliant or the person that fasts in the fast which God hath chosen,&mdash; for 1. there is not an holy prayer put up unto God, but its Original is God the Father, that prayer of Faith which proceeds from the heart of a Christian, was 1. In the heart of God the Father, and he through the Intercession and Mediation of his Son, sends it down by his holy Spirit into the heart of a poor sinner, and so stamps the Image of it upon the heart of the poor sinner that he believes, and then the Holy-Ghost that stamped it there, takes it from thence, and presents this through Christ unto the Father, &amp; then the Fathers heart is to give forth the answer through the Intercessi|on of the Son, and to give notice of it to the Soul of a Christian by his ho|ly Spirit. And when thou hast received the answer, the same Spirit works in thy heart to return praise and Thanksgiving by the Son unto the Fa|ther, so that here is a marvellous spiritual &amp; mysterious Communion in this, between God the Father, Son and holy Ghost, &amp; the poor believer, &amp; therefore such fasting cannot be in vain. Thus of the fifth general head.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of what concernment this may be unto our selves, and truly it is of very great concernment. We are the people that do succeed Israel. We are <HI>Jacob.</HI> Gods people that are under the same profession as the Lord speaks of them here, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. <HI>that seek God dayly, and delight to know his wayes,</HI> this is our profession, we are a Nation that seek Justice, that is our plea, that we must do right and not forsake the Ordinances of our God, this I say is our profession that we are bound to hearken after Gods will, and enquire after the Ordinances of Justice, we are they that by our dayly practice in appearing before God in solemn Assemblies profess that we delight to approach to him, therefore we are they that have need to take notice of this great and solemn Truth, that the Fast that is not of Gods chusing will be ineffectual, but that which is of Gods chusing will prevail, and that to five or six ends.</P>
<P N="1">1. To build us up in knowledge, there are great misteries contained in this Truth. I shall touch those that are of present consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. It teacheth you that there is a vast difference between duty and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"> religious performances and religious performances that
<PB N="20" REF="000258_0025_0FA4112663879C90">
which is spoken of fasting reaches through the whole body of Religion, there is a prayer that God hath chosen, and a prayer that God hath not chosen, and so this or that Ordinance or observation there is that which God will own and accept&punc; &amp; there is that which he will not countenance nor bless: our God is a God that will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, the manner and the end of our worship discovers what the nature of that service is, or of that particular religious act which we put forth towards him, look then to your own Spirits in your worship of God, as it is said of the person worshipping, so it is true of the worship, <HI>he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, but he that is one inwardly,</HI> (Rom 2. last verse.) <HI>whose praise is not of men but of God</HI>; you may be outwardly a Christian&punc; and inwardly an heathen in the sight of God, all these are uncircumcised in heart sayes the Prophet, when he reckons up the Nations together with <HI>Judah,</HI> you may be a Heathen in heart, whilest you are in the out|ward man a Christian, your Circumcision may become uncircumcision before God; alas what's an outward Baptisme, if your Souls never reach after spiritual Baptisme, if there be the washing with water without the Layer of Regeneration&punc; and the renewing of the holy Ghost, can you rest in that? or will God take pleasure in it? What is it for you to eat the Lords Supper, and not to eat the Lord who is that Supper? that is to receive Christ therein by Faith, mind the Spirit with which, and the end for which you wait upon God in holy Ordinances, What is your prayer&punc; if it be not the prayer which God hath chosen? it's but the ex|pression or voyce of a lust that will not be accepted of God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.3. <HI>you ask and have not, because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts,</HI> there are many mock-services whereby mock-Christians mock God in their profession. This is a sad mistery, but necessary to be known, there is a form of godliness without power, this is to make an Image to your selves, and to feed upon husks, and to deceive your own Souls with shadows, which will profit nothing; If you think to put off God with out|side services, such have a <HI>form of godliness but deny the power thereof,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.5. <HI>from such turn away.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It concerns us to know how hard it is to awaken a secure sinner that is covered under a form of godliness: take a profane person and the whole power of common Light, and common principles of humanity will fall in with the conviction of his miserable lost condition: tell a Drunkard that he shall drink in Hell for this his conscience tells him so, when he is sober. So an Adulterer his Conscience being awakened tells him he shall suffer Eternal Torment for his moments pleasure. So a gri|ping person his Conscience falls in with the Conviction, but a man under
<PB N="21" REF="000258_0026_0FA411285CE86018">
a form of godliness without the power thereof hath a ready salve for e|very sore, he stops his Ears with his Tongue, and becomes as the deaf Adder, hence saith God unto this people, <HI>Is this the Fast that I have chosen</HI>? and inculcates it again and again, <HI>It is not the Fast that I have chosen,</HI> &amp;c. and calls upon the Prophet, ver. 1. <HI>Cry aloud,</HI> cry out in thy throat, <HI>spare not, lift up thy voyce like a Trumpet,</HI> that thou mayst awaken them to the consideration of their sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. It concerns us to know that all our spiritual duties &amp; services must come to the trial, God will not only call us to account for all our open wicked|ness &amp; gross acts of Transgression but will try every service we perform; <HI>Is this the Fast that I have chosen,</HI> sayes God? was it such a prayer, such a participation in this or that Ordinance? Is this your Conference, are these the holy meetings, are these the Sabbaths? thus God will ask you, and God will accept none of your Services but they must pass through Gods tryal; Therefore we have need to examine our own Services, and our hearts in them, you are in your Closets meditating, but is this the meditation God hath chosen for Spirit, for matter &amp; for manner? you are crying and praying, but is this the prayer that God hath chosen? you are reproving, counselling&punc; admonishing your Children or others, but is it in the way that God hath chosen? you are dealing with your Neigh|bour or brother for some Transgression, but is it such an admonition as God hath chosen? remember that all your actions must come under this question, whether or no they are such as God hath chosen? <HI>I chuse out their way for them,</HI> sayes <HI>Job,</HI> of the time when he was as King among them, so if Christ be your King, he shall chuse your way for you, and you will chuse the things that please the Lord, and will not take any content|ment in that which doth not answer the Lords expectation.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it is of great concernment for our knowledge, so it concerns us for our examination &amp; trial, to try our wayes before the Lord our God, if God will try our fastings, prayers, &amp; other services, we had need to try &amp; exa|mine our selves. To judge our selves is the way to prevent Gods Judge|ments. Briefly&punc; examine we our selves concerning this our present Fast, is it <HI>a Fast which God hath chosen,</HI> as to our preparation for it? have you had solemn and serious thoughts concerning the way of Gods providence, concerning your persons, your Families, your Relations <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have you considered your own Transgressions before God, &amp; the great cause you have had of deep humiliation before God in respect of them? The defect of this is a failing of Gods expectation in the beginning, how|ever you may obtain in the procedure; have you been careful to abstain from natural, necessary comforts &amp; refreshings, further then necessity in re+spect
<PB N="22" REF="000258_0027_0FA41129DBE71100">
of infirmity calls for, and hath your abstinence proceeded from inward self-abhorrency, because of your sins. Extream grief takes away the appetite to eating and drinking. All the self denying acts that are required in a Fast are to proceed from a deep affliction of heart, other|wise it is but a shallow performance, &amp; of no worth with God; It is there|fore called the afflicting of the soul, and if it doe not come from Soul-affliction, it will be very unprofitable &amp; unacceptable. Again, are we real, are our hearts through with God in that solemn profession we make in such a day as this? Are you indeed sensible of your sins whereby you have provoked the Lord: Our particular sins, the sins of our Familyes, towns Churches and the sins of the Country? Doe we sincerely look out to God in Jesus Christ for the Spirit of Repentance? Is it his grace indeed that we look unto for help and succour, and that in the very mediation of Christ Jesus, through his death and blood-shed? Where is that spi|ritual self-abhorrency that should act and carry an end these holy servi|ces? Is there indeed a forgiving spirit? When you come before God are not your hearts, many of you, full of wrath &amp; anger, are you meek|ened like lambs before the Lamb of God in your holy offerings? Doe you present your selves upon that Altar which is the Lamb? Or do you fast for strife and debate, longing to be at it again, that you may mani|fest your displeasure when the time is over? And is there in you a spi|rit of compassion and working of bowels toward the poor and needy, whilst you are seeking mercy from God? Do you oblige and ingage your hearts to return to God, and to reform what is amiss in your per|sons, Families, Churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to the object of your work, &amp; where you may have influence to the utmost of your power? The Lord help us solemnly to examine our selves&punc; for if it be not thus with us, it's not the <HI>Fast which God hath chosen</HI>: and mind what your sin is,</P>
<P N="1">1&punc; It's like the worshipping of an Idol&punc; you have turned an holy Ordi|dinance into loathsome Idolatry, &amp; (as I may speak with holy reverence) you have carried it towards God, as if he had been one of the Idols of the Gentiles.</P>
<P N="2">2. You have taken the Name of God in vain this day in an extraor|dinary manner, and so put an extraordinary dishonour upon God, which is a most horrible profanation of the day, which should be kept as a Sab|bath; to keep it only with outward observance, without an heart spiritu|ally disposed, and graciously inclined, will you call this an acceptable day to the Lord?</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> Consider what will be the wofull issue, and evill consequence of it upon your selves, except God give you repentance of your forma|lity
<PB N="23" REF="000258_0028_0FA4112B4C401008">
in your services: instead of softening it will harden you, instead of mortifying sin, it will quicken it; instead of obtaining grace, it will bring displeasure; it will drive the Spirit of God from you, and bring Satan near unto you, and instead of the good you desire, it will bring about the contrary evill; you will be the worse for it, &amp; not the better: where was there greater wickedness effected, then hath been done by Fasting &amp; Prayer? See the horrible wickedness in the matter of Naboth, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 21 was ever woman more hardned then <HI>Jezebel</HI>? &amp; who like <HI>Ahab</HI> that sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom <HI>Jezebel</HI> stirred up. 'Tis the way to be sealed up under the Tomb-stone of an hard heart to celebrate a Fast with another Spirit, manner, and end then God hath chosen: Woeful ill consequents come upon persons and Families upon this account, commonly after a Fast, or solemn Ordinance, if not per|formed according to God; men, women, and children are the worse in their practice: <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.13. and this have you done again covering the Altar with tears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Insomuch that he regards not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand, when men will fast and pray and cover Gods Altar with tears, and yet hold fast their car|nal, corrupt, and impenitent frame of heart, they will be worse and worse in their places and Relations as there he speaks of the wife of youth a|gainst whom they had dealt treacherously, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And alas what outward miseries will it bring upon a Family, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.29, 30. because in eating the Supper of the Lord, they did not eat it, therefore one was sick, another weak, and another fallen asleep so if in fasting you do not fast, if in hum|bling your Souls, you do not humble your Souls, if in praying, you pray not, if you perform not such Services as God hath chosen, it will bring sickness upon those that are well and weakness and death upon the sick. It's mercy when we are thus judged of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. latter end.</P>
<P>Again it concerns us to consider what evil Consequents will come upon a people in this case, whence comes wars whence comes Famine? whence plagues? these, and those Judgements upon a professing people? because their worship is not worship, their godliness, their fasting and prayer is not such as God hath chosen, there is not the life and power of godli|ness in what they offer up to God and this provokes God to deal dread|fully with them, when lighter afflictions will not prevail. This brought desolation to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> because <HI>they fasted to themselves, and not to the Lord,</HI> Zach. 7.13, 14. Therefore it is come to pass that as <HI>he cried and they would not hear, so they cried and I would not hear, saith the Lord of Hosts, but I scattered them with a Whirlewind,</HI> &amp;c. For they laid the plea|sant Land desolate.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="000258_0029_0FA4112BB2D69A48">Again, it concerns those of us that are true observers of such a Fast as God hath chosen&punc; it concerns them for their consolation as here in the dayes of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> when God was pleased to set so many preci|ous hopes before them for themselves and their posterity, what a com|fort was it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is like to be your portion if God hath inclined your hearts to seek his Name.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Object.</HI> But you will say, these promises are indeed very glorious, but how can I take comfort in them? since I find my self falling so exceed|ing short in the qualifications required thereto?</P>
<P N="1">1 Answer, you must distinguish between falling short in degree, and in the whole, if there be in you no degree of these spiritual qualificati|ons you must even wait upon God, in pressing upon your hearts the dreadful consequents thereof, but if there be any, though the least de|gree, I would not discourage you, for when we speak of Evangelical du|ties, we must understand the qualifications in a Gospel sense, God looks at sincerity, and accepts the uprightness of the heart though accompani|ed with much infirmity.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Object.</HI> Another may say, I have laboured many a year, and can|not find my prayers thus answered.&mdash; <HI>Answ.</HI> We ought not to judge our selves by the Issues of Divine providence, but by the operations of Gods Spirit in us, if the work have been gracious in thy heart, the Issue shall be glorious to thy Soul in the end, <HI>and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Object.</HI> But if these things be necessary to an acceptable Fast, what benefit is there in a publick Fast, wherein the most do fall short of what is required thereto?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Whosoever falls short, thou that dost keep this Fast that God hath chosen, shalt have the blessing thereof. Therefore look to thine own heart, and thou shalt receive the Testimony of his gracious accep|tation, God knows how to save the good Figs, when he destroys a whole Nation of bad, he can find an Ark for a <HI>Noah,</HI> and cull out eight persons from a whole world to shew them his Salvation. Besides publick Fasts procure at least Reprieves. God will wait to see the fruit of it, and not put a full end to his patience, till there is no hope of answering Humiliation by Reformation.</P>
<P>And lastly, it concerns every one of us, to look diligently to our own Souls, when we have any such service to perform to the Lord our God that it be so done by us as God hath appointed, and that we repent of what hath not been according to Gods mind, and that we take care, that what remains may make it a Fast after Gods own choice.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="000258_0030_0FA4112C68FF5C80"><HI>Q Why is that possible?</HI> Yes if now at last thy Soul truly repents of thy sin, and be humbled and melts before God for thy carnality, thy unpre|paredness for the day, and thy unspiritualness in the day. And looking unto Christs Mediation for pardon, and acceptation, trusting in his gra|cious help, you take up resolutions to return to God, and to exercise mercy and loving kindness amongst men and to do Justice and Judge|ment, and to walk righteously, holily, and humbly with thy God it may turn this very Fast into a time of joy, and in Gods gracious acceptation, may be esteemed such a Fast as God hath chosen.</P>
<P>I would propound a few things here to your consideration as the Issue of this your Fast, and but propound them briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Look into your own hearts, get alone and consider what it is that hath been amiss in hearts and lives for time past, and set a narrow watch over your Souls for time to come, that you may not provoke God, and because you are weak and infirm, intreat God to set a watch over you by his holy Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now take up a resolution to walk with God, in your house in a perfect way, that neither your selves nor your Relations may be the worse for your Fastings&punc; and that Judgment may not come upon you in your house, because you have not glorified God in his house.</P>
<P N="3">3. Use your utmost interest for publick good, for the free passage of Justice and Judgment, Righteousness and Peace in the Common-wealth and Churches; and though you have no power of your selves, wrestle with God for it that it may be so.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take care that you hold fast the word of Gods patience in the time of your triall, hold it fast in Faith and practice, remember that word, <HI>He that continues to the end shall be saved.</HI> And again, <HI>Let no man take away thy crown.</HI> It is a day of tryal, but look to it, that you may be found upright in the day of tryal.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> Be open hearted, and open handed to those that are in misery and affliction, <HI>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall find Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church of Christ Jesus, throughout all ages world without end,</HI> Amen.</P>
