<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Prolegomena;</HI> or, Things premised.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THere be two holy Publick Societies famous in the Gospel:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>A Church of Believers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>A Council of Churches.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>A Church of Believers,</HI> is a company of visible Saints combined together, with one heart, to hold Communion in all the instituted Gospel-worship, Ordinances and Disci|pline, which Christ hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and given unto a parti|cular Church. Such a Company are frequently called <HI>A Church.</HI> See a few places: <HI>Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 2.47. &amp; 11.26. &amp; 14.23, 27. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.18, 20, 22, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>A Council,</HI> is a Society of particular Churches in Com|munion, by their Representatives, for their well-being, and well-ordering all things among them, by mutual Coun|sel, in Truth, Peace, and Holiness. Our Pattern is, that <HI>Great Council,</HI> Acts 15. which consisted of two Churches, in an ordinary way expresly agreed, to <HI>give</HI> and <HI>take counsel:</HI> and it is le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t as a Standard and Pattern, how the great Or|dinance
<PB N="2" REF="000101_0004_0FA028DAC27D5058">
of Counsel is to be used and managed for the well-being of Churches, to the worlds end.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Constitution of both these Buildings or Socie|ties, are eminent and observable in the Gospel.</P>
<P>The first of these, viz. <HI>A Church of Believers,</HI> is first instituted by Christ himself, and afterward put in practice by the Apostles; <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church</HI> The Rock confessed is <HI>CHRIST:</HI> Christ Confessed, is the Foundation of the Visible Church <NOTE N="&tridot;" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> confessing, is an hewn stone, squared to the foundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE>; a Believer made Ecclesiastically visible, fitted for Church-building and fellowship.</P>
<P>A company of such Confessors, or a company of these confessing Believers,</P>
<P N="1">1. Have power to joyn together into a Gospel Church-state, as they did <HI>Acts</HI> 1.13, 14. <HI>Continued with one accord</HI> so <HI>Acts</HI> 2.46.</P>
<P N="2">2. They have power to call Officers, by whom they be|come an Organick Body, and fitted to administer and enjoy all instituted Worship: <HI>Acts</HI> 1.15, 23. <HI>Peter stood up in the midst of the Disciples; And they appointed two.</HI> Acts 6.3. <HI>Brethren, look you out men.</HI> Acts 14.23. <HI>By holding up hands made Elders.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. By the Ministry of these Officers, the Church doth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tually enjoy such Ordinances as are instituted by Christ, for their Edification;</P>
<P>Both
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Directive,</HI> in Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Singing of Psalms, and Collections: <HI>Acts</HI> 2.42. <HI>They con|tinued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine, and fel|lowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</HI> Col. 3.16. <HI>Teaching one another in Psalms and Hymns,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. <HI>Every first day lay by it self,</HI> &amp;c. for <GAP DESC="foreign"> is the Neuter Gender, as well as Masculine, and is so to be read, be|cause they had two distinct Collections at that time The Collection for <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was by it self, a <HI>publick,</HI> not a <HI>private Collection.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Corrective:</HI> 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. <HI>When gathered together, deliver to Satan.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">III The administration of, and participation in all these Ordinances, (while we are in this flesh, and state militant) are so full of variety of difficulties and temptations, espe|cially where Churches are numerous, that the work cannot long be carried on (awhile it sometimes may, <HI>viz.</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e
<PB N="3" REF="000101_0005_0FA028DB670F9A70">
the Churches are under the eye of an adversary, and when there be Elders eminent in Piety, Humility and Ability) without stated help.</P>
<P>The help which the Lord hath instituted, is <HI>Counsel.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Antioch</HI> had trouble in some points of Doctrine, the Remedy which the holy Ghost applied, was <HI>Counsel,</HI> given them by a <HI>formall Council,</HI> Acts 15.</P>
<P>When <HI>Corinth</HI> wanted help in a point of Discipline, the Apostle doth help, by ministring <HI>Counsel</HI> unto them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.3, 4, 5. and he counselleth the Church to Excommunicate the man, the sinner.</P>
<P><HI>Excommunication</HI> is a sharp Rod, made up of seven most severe and terrible Twigs; or a strong Purgation, com|pounded of seven violent Ingredients; <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He is cut off from visible Communion with Christ in the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He is cut off from familiar Communion with the Saints in Worship.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He is cast out of the usual walk of the Spirit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He is cast out of the House of God, as unsavoury Salt, or a loathsome thing that doth offend.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He is thrust out of the Paradise of God, from eating the Tree of Life, <HI>viz.</HI> Christ in the Sacrament of the Supper, where the Spirit sitteth as in his Sealing-office.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He is cut off from familiar Civil Communion with the Saints; he may not be invited to eat with them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. He is delivered to Satan, and that by the Sentence of Christ, through the hand of his Spouse the Church: and all this to be inflicted upon a Brother.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Ah! who trembles not to minister such a <HI>Pill,</HI> to lay on such a <HI>Rod?</HI> And therefore it had need to be managed and administred with all care, fear, and clearness. And all this sheweth, and much more might be produced to shew, what need there is of <HI>Counsel</HI>; which, after thirty or forty years experience in the way of <HI>Congregational Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes,</HI> in fulness of liberty, we finde more and more need to insist upon, and that in such a fixed and ordered way, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t thereby men may be tyed to attend unto Counsel.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A <HI>Council</HI> is constituted <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts</HI> 15. where the wisdome of the holy Ghost hath given us a Pattern o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>the least</HI>&punc; and of the <HI>greatest Councils,</HI> as our <HI>N. E.</HI> Divines h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve well ob|served. There cannot be a <HI>less Council</HI> then that was, for there were but two Churches mentioned; and there cannot be a <HI>greater</HI>&punc; and more compleat one, because there were
<PB N="4" REF="000101_0006_0FA028DC357B73B8">
the greatest Counsellors, a most compleat Pattern, even the Apostles of Jesus Christ; teaching, That if there be but two Churches, they may enjoy the Ordinance of <HI>mutuall Counsel,</HI> though more incompleatly. But if there be many Churches, then they are to be ordered according to the Pat|tern of Combining Churches into compleat Councils. <HI>Of which in the next Chapter.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Christ, who hath <HI>all power,</HI> Mat. 28.20. hath derived all Ecclesiastical Power fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t unto the Apostles, that they by Institution might distribute the same unto several Offices in the Church. Hence,</P>
<P>As all Church-Officers, especially Elders, and more espe|cially <HI>Teaching Elders,</HI> are ordinary Successors of the Apo|stles, in their several branches of Church-power: So <HI>Coun|cils of Churches</HI> are their eminent ordinary Successors, in point of Counsel, and that in several respects.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because in Councils there is <HI>most light,</HI> and nearest to infallibility: and the more compleat, the better; though the most compleat Council may erre, because they have not a promise of infallible assistance.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Because when the Apostles themselves had con|stituted Churches, they did guide and counsel them how to use their power; as <HI>Paul</HI> did the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.4. the Apostle did not act the Censure himself: and so is that of <HI>Paul</HI> to be interpreted, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.20. <HI>I have deli|vered to Satan</HI>; viz. as I did the incestuous <HI>Corinthian,</HI> by giving such counsel to the Church, whereof they were Members. In thus doing Councils succeed the Apostles.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Inasmuch as Councils are <HI>Publick Assemblies,</HI> and that not onely Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lesiastically publick, but Civilly also, when they are h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld with openness and boldness. Hence, <HI>Civill Authority</HI> hath influence, by Law and Command, to give al|lowance unto such Assemblies; and so they have an <HI>Ex|trinsecall Effi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iency</HI> in calling Councils: but the <HI>Intrinsecall</HI> and <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per Efficients</HI> of a Council, are <HI>the Churches,</HI> who elect and send Messen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs to that end.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The Members constituent of a Council, are <HI>Church-Messengers.</HI></P>
<P>The persons sent ought to be <HI>Elders,</HI> of <HI>both Orders, Teaching</HI> and <HI>Ruling,</HI> to represent the whole Church; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n defect of <HI>Ruling Elders</HI> to represent the people, <HI>Faithful Brethren</HI> eminent in holiness and wisdome, who are as El|ders: <HI>Acts</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.2. <HI>Certain other of them</HI> Ver. 22. <HI>Chosen men chief men amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Brethren.</HI> Ver. 32. <HI>Being Prophets also
<PB N="5" REF="000101_0007_0FA028DCE523FAF8">
themselves.</HI> And the reason hereof is, Because, as the tem|ptation of Learned men, is to affect a Prelacy over the peo|ple: So the temptation of the Fraternity, is to affect a Morellian Democracy. And therefore the wisdome of God hath by institution ballanced all Ecclesiastical Coun|cils with Members of <HI>both sorts,</HI> that may ballance each other, by <HI>Number</HI> at least, though not in <HI>Weight,</HI> yet enough to prevent any prevalency of a temptation, either to sub|jugate the Churches under any Prelatical Usurpation of the Learned; or to elevate and intoxicate the Fraternity, to affect any inordinate power: which rather, and more effe|ctually tends to enervate and evacuate Government, then to preserve any Lawful and just Liberty of the Brotherhood.</P>
<P>The end of the Churches sending these Messengers, is to manage the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel</HI> in due order.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Organick parts of a Council, whereby they are enabled to manage their affairs in Prudence and Order, are <HI>Moderators,</HI> and <HI>Notaries:</HI> the choice of whom is the first act they do, to compleat themselves to be fit for action.</P>
<P>It may sometimes edifie, to <HI>change Moderators</HI> every new Session, partly to train up each other unto that special work of Christ, in the management of the Affairs, and in caring for the publick welfare of all the Churches; and also to take trial of mens Gifts, Spirit and Abilities unto that high service; that so, when there may be special need, they may know who is most fit to manage the Council at such a time, for the glory of God, and for the most effectual Edi|fication, and publick well being of the Churches.</P>
<P>Though Moderators may be often changed, it is not fit that the Notaries should be so often changed.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The Power of Ecclesiastical Councils is onely Dogma|tical, or Doctrinal: Power of <HI>Censure</HI> is by the Lord fixed in the <HI>Church</HI>; and hence, when any appeal unto a Council, it is for further and more clear light from the Scripture, and for conviction thereby, but not for the Exercise of any Juridical Power.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="000101_0008_0FA028DDAE110B88">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Gospel-Measuring-R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d by the Number <HI>Twelve.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. SEeing particular Congregations in Gospel-Order, are <HI>Churches</HI>; and these Churches, for their well-being, need to hold and exercise <HI>Communion by Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ils:</HI> and one Church (as <HI>Antioch</HI>) may need the greatest and highest Counsel.</P>
<P>Hence in such places where, through the riches of the Grace of Christ, Churches are numerous, it will be neces|sary, that the management of these Councils should be in Order, according to the Pattern of <HI>Compleat Councils, Acts</HI> 15. For multitude unordered, by how much the greater they are, the greater is their cumber, and unapt|ness to operate in Order unto their end. Lesser Bodies are more readily ordered, and have a greater aptitude to be active in their Order unto their end. <HI>Ordo anima rerum.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Order</HI> is one of the <HI>Beauties of Heaven,</HI> and so it is of the Churches. <HI>Let all things be done in Order,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.40. <HI>Jerusalem is a City compacted,</HI> Psal. 122.3. and the more orderly Bodies are, the better are they compacted. Bodies that are compacted, are so ordered by <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Measure:</HI> The <HI>New Jerusalem</HI> is the most glorious City that ever shall be on Earth; and we see that it shall be compacted by <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Measure,</HI> Rev. 21.12, <HI>to</HI> 18. and the Founda|tion Number is <HI>Twelve,</HI> as appeareth <HI>ver.</HI> 14. <HI>The wall of the City had twelve Foundations.</HI> And this Number <HI>Twelve</HI> is multiplied by <HI>Twelve,</HI> as appeareth <HI>ver.</HI> 16, 17. it is square, <HI>Twelve</HI> every way, which amounteth to One hundred forty and four.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Twelve Tribes</HI> in the Old Testament, and the <HI>Twelve Apostles</HI> in the New, do make that Number famous in the Churches, and fundamental in ordering and com|pacting of Churches into Ecclesiasticall Combinations of Councils.</P>
<P>The <HI>Twelve Tribes</HI> compacted in order, was the most beautiful, and heart-ravishing Camp, that ever the worlds Eye did look upon, <HI>Numb.</HI> 24.2, 5, 6. The <HI>Twelve Loaves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Shew-bread,</HI> did represent the whole Visible Church
<PB N="7" REF="000101_0009_0FA028DE61489D58">
before God in the Temple. The <HI>Twelve Precious Stones in the Breast-plate of the High Priest,</HI> shew, That in such a Number Christ is pleased to order and represent the whole Militant Church before his Father in Heaven. And ac|cording to this Type, <HI>Rev.</HI> 7.4. the whole Visible Church is ordered, multiplied, and sealed in this Number. And <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.12, 14. the <HI>Twelve Tribes</HI> are the <HI>Twelve Gates,</HI> and the <HI>Twelve Apostles</HI> are the <HI>Twelve Foundations</HI> of the <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI> That glorious visible Gospel-Church, <HI>Ezek</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8. which is called <HI>Jehovah-Shamm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> is ordered by the Num|ber <HI>Twelve,</HI> according to the Twelve Tribes of Israel, as the Typical Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was.</P>
<P N="4">IV. In the <HI>perfect Pattern</HI> (for the Word is a <HI>perfect Rule</HI>) which the holy Ghost hath left us, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. as there is a ground work for the least of Councils, in the <HI>Two Churches</HI>; so of compleat Councils, in the <HI>Twelve Apo|stles.</HI></P>
<P>For, though <HI>Herod</HI> had killed <HI>James</HI> with the sword, <HI>Acts</HI> 12.2. his Martyrdome did not remove him out of the <HI>Foundation,</HI> but rather fix him in it: And the Apostles were most of them killed for <HI>the Testimony of Jesus</HI> before <HI>John</HI> had his <HI>Revelation,</HI> and yet we finde them all written in the Foundation of the <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore what should hinder, but that in the or|dering of <HI>Compleat Councils,</HI> we should lay our foundation in the Number <HI>Twelve?</HI> and all the Orders of Councils should be raised and compacted by that Number, even from the bottom to the top.</P>
<P N="5">V. And unto this <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Number</HI> we may the rather be induced, because here will be the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> who do wait upon, and worship the holy Majesty of God in all the Churches upon earth, as he hath pleased to reveal himself, <HI>Rev.</HI> 4. where the presence of God among the Churches is revealed: First, with his glorious Angels next him, represented by the <HI>four living Creatures,</HI> according to <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 10. And secondly, with the Communion of Churches about him, represented by the <HI>Twenty four El|ders,</HI> who do represent all the Churches on earth, in Com|munion: as will anon appear.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or when <HI>Twelve Churches</HI> are combined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld Communion together, the least Number that one Church must (by Institution) send forth to that first Council, must be <HI>one Teaching Elder,</HI> and <HI>one Ruling Elder</HI>; and then&punc; this Society of Churches is represented by <HI>twenty f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Elders</HI> strictly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000101_0010_0FA028E18626B118">And when <HI>Twelve</HI> of these <HI>first Councils</HI> shall, with con|sent of the particular Churches, elect and send forth <HI>one Teaching,</HI> and <HI>one Ruling Elder,</HI> the ablest and fittest among them, to constitute a <HI>Provincial Council</HI>; that Council will be strictly the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> representing all the Churches in that Province, concurring in the Election.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Twelve Provincial Councils</HI> shall, with like con|sent, send forth from each of them <HI>one Teaching,</HI> and <HI>one Ruling Elder,</HI> the most holy and able among them, to con|stitute a <HI>National Council,</HI> they will still be strictly the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> representing the whole Nation, in their Ecclesiastical state, before the Lord.</P>
<P>And when <HI>Twelve National Councils</HI> shall send forth, in like manner, from each of them, <HI>one Teaching,</HI> and <HI>one Ruling Elder,</HI> the most holy and fit among them, to consti|tute an <HI>Oecumenical Council</HI> (or by what other less term it may be thought meet to call it) they will still be strictly the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> representing before the Lord all the Churches in all those Nations, concurring in the Election.</P>
<P>And why may not this ascent, and representation of all before the Lord, be part of the meaning of that Text, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.8, 9, 11, 12, 14?</P>
<P N="7">VII. And this point is the more to be heeded, because Gods visible respect unto, and acceptation of any people, is according to the good aspect and condition of their <HI>Repre|sentatives.</HI> There may be much dross in a Parish, a Pro|vince, a Nation, and in the world; yet if they have good Re|presentatives before the Lord, and if they carry the Lords matters well, in his sight, that doth obtain, through Christ, a favourable acceptation of, and dispensation towards all that are so represented. And he hath instituted Represen|tatives of the Church on earth: <HI>Aaron</HI> represented <HI>all Is|rael on his breast before the Lord,</HI> Exod. 28.29. And a Coun|cil consisting of <HI>Messengers of Churches,</HI> the glory of Christ, do represent the Churches who send and constitute that Council, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. Oh! how happy were it for any people, to be in such visible instituted Order on earth, as that they may be (through Christ) acceptably represented before the Lord!</P>
<P>For God is so well pleased to see his people in Order, as that he will dwell in that place, and call it by his own Name, <HI>Jehovah-Shammah</HI>; especially when they are Civilly, as well as Ecclesiastically in good order represented before Him.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="9" REF="000101_0011_0FA028E2B191F8D0">VIII. Furthermore, this is to be considered, that though the <HI>Twenty four Elders</HI> are so called, by the least Number that they can be, by this Constitution; yet, according as the riches of Gods grace is more abundantly poured out, they may be more in Number, though under this constituting denomination. For, one Church may send forth <HI>two Teach|ing Elders,</HI> as <HI>Antioch</HI> sent forth <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> or <HI>Brethren</HI> proportionably. So likewise upon the same ground, when there be more <HI>Eminent Lights</HI> in any of the Councils (as through grace it is like often to be) they may send more then one to the <HI>Provincial,</HI> or <HI>Na|tional,</HI> or <HI>Oecumenical Councils:</HI> but still they are the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> because that is the <HI>Foundation Num|ber.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. What if I should illustrate this Point by that of the Apostles? who are often in Scripture called <HI>the Twelve Apostles,</HI> and yet there were more Apostles then <HI>Twelve:</HI> for who doubteth but that <HI>Paul,</HI> who was none of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> yet he was <HI>an Apostle,</HI> and <HI>a chief Apostle,</HI> a great Foundation; and <HI>Barnabas</HI> was <HI>an Apostle</HI> also, <HI>Acts</HI> 14.14. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.9. But <HI>Twelve</HI> is the <HI>Foundation Number,</HI> and therefore they are so denominated.</P>
<P N="10">X. Again, though <HI>Twelve Churches</HI> be the lowest Num|ber of the <HI>first Combination,</HI> yet they may be more then <HI>Twelve,</HI> when the pourings out of Gods grace shall be in|larged; yea, they may be any Number under <HI>Twenty four Churches.</HI></P>
<P>If then <HI>Twenty three Churches</HI> should be in a Combina|tion, their Messengers sent to the <HI>first Council</HI> will be a great Number; but still they are the <HI>Twenty four Elders</HI> before the Lord, by their fundamental Constitution.</P>
<P>So a like Number of <HI>Provincial Councils,</HI> and a like Num|ber of <HI>National Councils,</HI> though their Messengers are many, yet they are still the <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> growing up, through grace, and increasing unto more <HI>Orders of Councils,</HI> for the greater glory of Christ.</P>
<P>And when (through grace) there shall be <HI>Twenty four Churches,</HI> or <HI>first Councils,</HI> or <HI>Provincial,</HI> or <HI>National Coun|cils,</HI> then they must be compacted into <HI>two Orders</HI> of those Councils, because <HI>Twelve</HI> is the Foundation Number, by which they are multiplied, and compacted. And when this is done, they are reduced to be <HI>Twenty four Elders</HI> strictly, the <HI>Foundation Number.</HI></P>
<P>As in the Order of that <HI>Civill Government</HI> set up by <HI>Mo|ses</HI>;
<PB N="10" REF="000101_0012_0FA028E937E5C4C8">
the Orders of <HI>Ten,</HI> and of <HI>Fifty,</HI> &amp;c. are denominated b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the least and constituting Number: though those Orders may consist (when they are full of people and blessing) of many more, even any number under <HI>Twenty</HI> and <HI>an hun|dred, &amp;c.</HI> But when <HI>Ten</HI> are become <HI>Twenty,</HI> and when <HI>Fifty</HI> are become <HI>an hundred,</HI> then they must be multiplied into <HI>more Orders,</HI> because these Numbers are <HI>Foundation Numbers</HI> by which the <HI>Orders</HI> of the Government are mul|tiplied and compacted; and when that is transacted, they are reduced unto their <HI>Foundation Numbers.</HI></P>
<P>So it is here is the Ecclesiastical Orders of Government, the least Number of a compleat stated <HI>first Council,</HI> is <HI>Twelve Churches</HI>&punc; whose least Number of Messengers are <HI>Twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and by these Numbers they are denominated, though they may be more Churches in a Combination, and more Messengers from some of the Churches: and so it is in all the other <HI>Orders of Councils.</HI></P>
<P>For a little further illustration of this point, I shall propose and answer <HI>Six Questions,</HI> which may let in a little fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her light into this Frame, and remove some Obje|ctions.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>May a Church perform any Ecclesiastical Acts by Messengers, or Representatives in their Name?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yea&punc; doubtless they may: they may <HI>Consult,</HI> and <HI>Agree</HI> to <HI>give Counsel,</HI> in such cases as may be presented for that end, touching either <HI>Faith</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as it appeareth <HI>Acts</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Quest 2. <HI>May a Church elect by Messengers or Representa|tives&punc; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> themselves cannot be present where su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Elective is performed?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> An act of Election may be transacted by <HI>some</HI> of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ociety; yea by <HI>a few</HI> in behalf of the rest, when they have their consent, and a calling so to act. For instance,</P>
<P>If a <HI>lesser Number</HI> of a Church be necessarily absent from an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct of Election performed in a lawful Assembly, they are all involved in the act of the <HI>major</HI> part: This is without Controversie so. Here some onely Elect, and all are en|gaged.</P>
<P>Again, if the <HI>major</HI> part be necessarily absent, and send a <HI>lesser</HI> part, or <HI>a few,</HI> with their express consent to do an act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fection, it hath the like force and validity. The royal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which chose <HI>David</HI> to be their King, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. were farre the lesser part of the People, but they were <HI>sent</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and did perform it as affectually
<PB N="11" REF="000101_0013_0FA028E9DCE08C30">
as if the <HI>whole People</HI> had been present; and <HI>David</HI> was King, not onely over the <HI>Representatives,</HI> who did actually chuse him, but over <HI>all the People,</HI> who did Elect him by their Representatives.</P>
<P>If the parties <HI>sent</HI> to transact an Election, do act accord|ing to their heart who sent them, they will not object, for had they been there present, they would have done the same: but if the parties sent to Elect, do not Elect accord|ing to their heart, they may justly question their act, and consider of their Apologie; but that doth not <HI>nul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifie</HI> the act in point of Order.</P>
<P>When <HI>Political Bodies,</HI> whether <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> are multitudinous, and remote from the place or action, either <HI>all cannot act,</HI> or if they do, it must be by <HI>Represen|tatives.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>May a Church Elect Elders or Messengers out of another Church&punc; unto a publick and common service of Christ and of the Churches?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yea, they may: For the <HI>great Collection</HI> of the <HI>Gentile Churches,</HI> which <HI>Paul</HI> carried up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at his last going thither, was an act of <HI>many Churches:</HI> And <HI>Paul,</HI> with those that went with him to present it, were <HI>chosen by the Churches</HI> unto that service, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And there were <HI>many more Churches Contributors,</HI> then there were <HI>Messengers sent to carry it. Acts</HI> 20.4. there were but seven or eight in <HI>Pauls</HI> company, but all the Churches of <HI>Galatia, Corinth, Asia,</HI> and <HI>Macedonia,</HI> were Contributors. There|fore many Churches <HI>chose Messengers</HI> who were none of their own <HI>particular Churches,</HI> unto that <HI>publick and common ser|vice of Christ, and of the Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the ready subjection of all the Churches about <HI>Antioch,</HI> and other places, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.4. unto the Decrees of the Council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> doth probably speak, That, as the trouble by those <HI>Questions,</HI> was a <HI>common case</HI> in all the Churches; so they had some <HI>fore-knowledge, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urrence,</HI> and <HI>consent</HI> (after <HI>consent</HI> sure enough they had) in the Mis|sion of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> (Teaching Elders of <HI>Antioch, Acts</HI> 13.2.) unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the Apostles and Elders about that matter.</P>
<P>Again&punc; seeing the Rule of <HI>Communion of Churches</HI> doth impose upon Elders a <HI>degree of care of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Churches,</HI> espe|cially of those <HI>within their Ordered Communion</HI>; it doth al+so give unto all the Churches, a <HI>mutual interest in each others Elders.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000101_0014_0FA028EA968E0C40">Hence, when they chuse any of the Elders within the compass of their Order, they chuse those, who, in <HI>some re|spect,</HI> are their own, in whom they have an <HI>Ecclesiastical in|terest,</HI> especially unto this publick service of <HI>Counsel.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>May many Churches Elect a few of their Elders unto some publick and common service, wherein all the Chur|ches so Electing are interessed?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yea, they may: For <HI>all the Churches</HI> of <HI>Asia, Ga|latia, Macedonia,</HI> &amp;c. did Elect <HI>a few</HI> to accompany <HI>Paul</HI> in carrying their Contributions unto <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> and it is expresly said, that from the Churches of <HI>Asia</HI> there were but <HI>two sent,</HI> Acts 20.4. and we know there were at least <HI>seven Churches</HI> in <HI>Asia,</HI> Rev. 1.4.</P>
<P>Quest. 5. <HI>When two, or a few Elders are chosen by many Churches unto some publick and common service of the Chur|ches, do they represent all the Churches who did Elect them unto that service?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Yea, they do so: For when <HI>many Churches</HI> (by <HI>Paul</HI>'s ordering) sent <HI>a few</HI> Messengers to <HI>Corinth,</HI> 2 Cor. 8.23. to fetch their Contribution, to be carried (among the Contribution of many other Churches) unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by the hands of <HI>Paul,</HI> and a few others, chosen by the Churches unto that service, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.19. these <HI>few Messengers</HI> did re|present <HI>all the Churches who sent them:</HI> So as that what the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> should transact <HI>afore them,</HI> is expresly said to be <HI>afore all the Churches,</HI> viz. who sent them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.24.</P>
<P>Quest. 6. <HI>These Orders of Councils, First, Second, Third, or representing fewer or more Churches, Are they a Divine In|stitution?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Touching the <HI>first Councils,</HI> consisting of imme|diate <HI>Messengers of Churches</HI> sent for that end, it is out of question that these are a <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> Acts 15.</P>
<P>The great difficulty is, touching the <HI>second</HI> and <HI>third Orders of Councils,</HI> and so higher, unto the highest <HI>Oecume|nical Council,</HI> whose Members are chosen immediately by Councils, yet with the express consent of every particular Church: not immediately by the <HI>Churches,</HI> but by their <HI>Re|presentatives.</HI></P>
<P>Touching these, in way of humble Proposal I affirm,
<HI>That they are a Divine Institution.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Because their <HI>Foundation, Formation,</HI> and <HI>Constitution,</HI> is deducible from the <HI>Word of God,</HI> as appeareth by laying together the foregoing <HI>Questions,</HI> and <HI>Answers</HI> thereunto, with what hath been said before.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="000101_0015_0FA028EBABBCA7C0">2. Because this <HI>multiplying of Order upon Order,</HI> seemeth to be typified in the <HI>Ascents</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> in <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Tem|ple; and by the multiplication of the Number <HI>Twelve</HI> in the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> Rev. 21, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Because if there be not this <HI>multiplying of Council above Council (above,</HI> I say, not in any <HI>Political Power,</HI> but in <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI>) then it doth not yet appear that there is any way or expedient, whereby there should be a <HI>General</HI> and <HI>Equal</HI> Communion of all the Churches in a Nation, wherein every Church shall be, by their own act and con|sent, interessed and concerned.</P>
<P>Much less can there be an <HI>Equal</HI> Communion of Churches, of several Nations.</P>
<P>For, if several Nations should need and desire to hold <HI>Communion of Councils,</HI> who shall chuse the <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>In|struments,</HI> by whom this Communion shall be held and acted?</P>
<P>If <HI>Princes</HI> chuse them, it is not a regular Ecclesiastical Council. If <HI>Churches</HI> chuse and send them, shall <HI>some Churches</HI> onely chuse them, or <HI>all the Churches?</HI> if <HI>some</HI> onely; <HI>who?</HI> and why <HI>they,</HI> and not <HI>others?</HI> and how can their act interest and oblige all?</P>
<P>If <HI>all</HI> the Churches must chuse, then <HI>Immediately,</HI> or <HI>by Delegates: Immediately,</HI> it is unfeizible, especially to act in knowledge and prudence; but <HI>mediately</HI> by their <HI>Confi|dents</HI> and <HI>Representatives</HI> they may.</P>
<P>The same may be said of the Communion of all the Chur|ches in a Nation or Province, where Elections must be per|formed by Representatives. In which way, a <HI>General</HI> and <HI>Equal</HI> Election is attainable; and without it, it doth not yet appear that it is attainable.</P>
<P>Now that <HI>several Nations</HI> ought to hold Communion, and also <HI>all the Churches</HI> in a Nation, it doth appear in these Scriptures: <HI>Isa.</HI> 19.23, 24, 25. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.16. <HI>&amp;</HI> 14.32, 36. Of which see more in <HI>Synod at Boston.</HI></P>
<P>This being commanded by God, and as yet no Way or Expedient appearing, whereby it may be duely acted, we are at a great loss. Therefore the Lord opening this way, which is so attainable, and not without Scripture Light, What if the Churches should set upon the <HI>Tryall</HI> of it, and see how the Lord may appear unto his Servants therein? As for the <HI>Episcopal Way of Government,</HI> Alas! that is most remote from this Ordinance of <HI>Communion of Chur|ches.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Constitution of Four Orders of Councils.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. WHen <HI>Twelve Churches,</HI> or any other Number un|der <HI>Twenty four,</HI> shall agree to hold Communion in a Council for <HI>Mutual Help,</HI> and shall send forth Messen|gers at least <HI>two</HI> from every Church, and they of both Or|ders of Elders, or in defect of <HI>Ruling Elders, Brethren emi|nent in Piety and Wisdome,</HI> who are as Elders, to manage the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel</HI> in the behalf, and for the benefit of all the Churches herein combined.</P>
<P>These do constitute the <HI>first Order</HI> of a compleat Coun|cil; the <HI>first Ascent</HI> of the glorious Temple; the <HI>first Row</HI> in compacting the <HI>New Jerusalem.</HI> These are the <HI>Twenty four Elders</HI> before the Lord, representing all the Congregations which sent them.

<P N="2">II. When <HI>Twelve</HI> of the <HI>first Order</HI> of Councils, or any other Number under <HI>Twenty four,</HI> shall, with the express consent of all their particular Churches, agree to hold Com|munion in a Council for <HI>Mutual Help,</HI> and for the benefit of all the Churches combined; and to that end, shall send forth from among themselves, at least <HI>one</HI> principal and eminent <HI>Teaching Elder,</HI> and <HI>one Ruling Elder,</HI> to manage the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel,</HI> in a Provincial Synod, in the be|half, and for the benefit of all the Churches herein com|bined: These do constitute the <HI>second Order of Councils.</HI> These are a <HI>Provincial Council</HI>; these do represent very many Churches, and all the people in them, with their ex|press consent, and yet they are but <HI>Twenty four Elders,</HI> so denominated by their least and constituting Number, though the Numbers represented be very great, according to <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.8, 9, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These all are <HI>Church-Messengers</HI>&punc; sent forth to manage the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel,</HI> though immediately sent forth by the <HI>first Councils,</HI> with the express consent of all the Churches combined.

<P N="7">VII.

And according to the number of <HI>Teaching El|ders</HI> whom they send, the like number of <HI>Ruling E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ders,</HI> or <HI>principal Brethren</HI> they are to send, and associate with them.</P>
<P N="2">II. This act of the Churches Election must be diligently, religiously and solemnly attended and performed, as being fundamentally and essentially requisite, both for the <HI>Consti|tution</HI> of all Councils, and for the <HI>Obligation</HI> of all Chur|ches unto obedience.</P>
<P>This act of the Church hath reference, not onely to the Constitution of the <HI>first Council,</HI> but also of all the rest. For seeing Churches are the <HI>Efficient Causes</HI> of Councils, none are to be chosen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Provincial&punc; National,</HI> or <HI>Oecume|nical Synod,</HI> but such as were <HI>first chosen</HI> by some particular Church, to constitute a <HI>first Council</HI>&punc; and to carry on the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel</HI> according to order.</P>
<P>Hence also it must be carefully and expressedly put into the Vote of this <HI>first act</HI> of the Churches Election, That they are chosen to carry on the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel</HI> in all the Orders of it, both in <HI>Provincial National,</HI> and <HI>Oecume|nical Councils,</HI> even unto the highest point: for though all
<PB N="19" REF="000101_0021_0FA028F535960868">
that are thus elected and sent by the Churches; are not to be el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted and sent to <HI>Provincial, National,</HI> and <HI>Oecumenical Councils,</HI> yet some of them are to be sent, and all of them are in elect and send. And therefore when the Church doth elect and send them to this <HI>first Council,</HI> they are, by this act of the Church, impowered to carry on the Ordi|nance of <HI>Counsel,</HI> through all the Orders thereof, even to the top branch, either by <HI>electing others,</HI> or being <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lected themselves,</HI> unto those services of Christ, and of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur|ches.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Time</HI> of this Election, is to be upon the <HI>Sab|bath</HI> immediately preceding the <HI>stated time</HI> of the <HI>first Coun|cils</HI> Monethly Meeting: and then are they to be sent forth with the Prayers and Blessing of the Church.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>Provincial Council</HI> doth consist of the <HI>choycest Instruments</HI> in all the <HI>first Councils,</HI> by whom they are cho|sen and sent with their Prayers and Blessing: Every <HI>first Council</HI> electing the most holy, learned, and able Eld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, both <HI>Teaching</HI> and <HI>Ruling,</HI> that they have, who are most fit to promote and attain the ends they are sent for, viz. To carry on the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel</HI> in a <HI>Provincial Synod,</HI> both by themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and by chusing such as may further promote the same in a <HI>National Council,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. The <HI>Time</HI> of <HI>this Election,</HI> is to be in that Session of the <HI>first Councils,</HI> which doth immediately precede the stated <HI>Quarterly time</HI> of the Provincial Councils Meet|ing.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of this Election may be this: The <HI>Moderator</HI> of that Session may first put this to vote, <HI>whe|ther they will send but one, or more then one Teach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng Elders</HI>; for by the good Providence and rich Grace of Christ, there may be sundry able and eminent <HI>Lights</HI> in one <HI>first Council,</HI> and such, as that it were a publick injury and detriment to the Cause of Christ, if they be not sent. This provided, That according to the Number of <HI>Teaching Elders,</HI> a like Num|ber of <HI>Ruling Elders</HI> be also sent with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manner</HI> of Election may be by <HI>Papers,</HI> if they see meet, which the <HI>Moderator</HI> and <HI>Notary</HI> are to take, and number, and manifest who are chosen: and such as are chosen, are by the <HI>Notary</HI> to be recorded.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>National Council</HI> doth consist of the most choice, holy, able, and eminent <HI>Lights</HI> in all the <HI>Provincial Councils,</HI> by whom they are chosen, and sent forth with their prayers and blessing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="000101_0022_0FA028F83A80A770">Every <HI>Provincial Council</HI> chusing the most holy and able Elders, both <HI>Teaching</HI> and <HI>Ruling</HI> that they have among them, to constitute a <HI>National Council,</HI> and to carry on the Ordinance of <HI>Counsel,</HI> in that high and holy service of Christ, and of all the Churches in the Nation; yea&punc; and among other Nations if need be, and when there is a calling thereunto.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The <HI>Time</HI> of this Election, is to be in <HI>that Session</HI> of the Provincial Councils, which doth immediately pre|cede the stated time of the <HI>Annual Session</HI> of the National Council.</P>
<P>The <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of their Election, may be in all respects according to the forementioned Election in the Provincial Synod.</P>
<P N="9">IX. An <HI>Oecumenical Council,</HI> is to consist of the most holy and eminent <HI>Lights</HI> in all the <HI>National Councils,</HI> combined in this holy Ordinance of <HI>Mutual Counsel</HI>; and may readily be ordered by this standard, when the Lord shall in the riches of his grace, give opportunity to exercise the same.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Duration</HI> of these Councils.</P>
<P N="10">X. Every one of these Councils doth continue in being, until, according to Order, a <HI>new Election</HI> be made; the new Election doth antiquate the old.</P>
<P>Hence, as the Primitive Church had Apostles alwayes in being, for their help; So there be at least three <HI>Orders of Ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stical Councils,</HI> ever in being in every populous Christian Nation, who must at the <HI>stated Times,</HI> and may at any <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> meet,</HI> when the affairs of Christ, and of any of the Churches do need, and duely call for the same.</P>
<P>And when Christian Nations shall be thus combined, there will be an <HI>Oecumenical Council</HI> ever in being: yea, and when all the World shall be combined, there will be <HI>a great Oecumenical Council</HI> ever in being&punc; to order all ecclesiastical a faires, in unity, holiness and peace, all the World over.</P>
<P N="11">XI. A principal objection ariseth against this fixing and stating of Councils; viz. <HI>That although pre-renas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent Coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ils are a divine remedy, when troubles arise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it was at</HI> Antioch, <HI>who also then finished the Council&punc; when the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was finished: but of fixed&punc; stated, and permanent Coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ls we have no example&punc; nor doth there appear any ground in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ripture to bottom them upon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Primitive Churches had a <HI>stated</HI> and <HI>permanent</HI> way of counsel eminently, and more then our <HI>stated</HI> and <HI>per|manent Councils</HI> can be, for they had the Apostles and Evan|gelists constantly among them.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="000101_0023_0FA028F8D2F560D8">And though they had fixed Elders in every Church, yet they did need the visitations, and frequently made use of the counsel of the Apostles and Evangelists, who were the <HI>permanent Councils</HI> of the Primitive Churches</P>
<P>And though it hath pleased the wisdome of our great Lawgiver, to give us but <HI>one Example</HI> of an ordinary Coun|cil, and that he hath done, to be our perpetual guide in our ordinary way; yet there be many examples of the Churches need of, and frequent use of the Apostles and Evangelists counsel, whom they had alwayes with them, or knew <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> to repair unto them for their help.</P>
<P>And we finde by much and long experience, that our <HI>Re|forming Churches</HI> do stand in as much (if not more) need of <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>stated Councils,</HI> as the primitive Churches did, or the <HI>constant presence</HI> of the Apostles and Evangelists, alwayes for their <HI>directive,</HI> and often for their <HI>corrective help.</HI></P>
<P>We finde by experience, that our Churches do oftener need the <HI>directive</HI> help of Councils, then the <HI>corrective,</HI> and in both respects together we need them to be always in being.</P>
<P>Many good works for the promotion of the Gospel and Kingdom of Jesus Christ do stick long in the birth, and languish: yea, oft miscarry and vanish for want of the help of Councils.</P>
<P>Sundry Churches also, and remote places, ly long in the dark, without rood and help, for want of the orderly care of setled Councils; <HI>Every bodies work i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no-bodies.</HI> But when all Churches are in order, all know where their work lyeth.</P>
<P>Disorders likewise, and insuperable distempers, by long fretting and burning in the bosom of sundry Churches, to the great dishonour of God, and scandal to the Saints, for want of <HI>stated Councils</HI>: some or other refusing (in the time of their temptations) to submit themselves unto the remedy, especially having that advantage, that without <HI>their consent,</HI> a <HI>pro-renascent Council</HI> may not be called; or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> called by <HI>some onely,</HI> they have the less opportunity of doing good, and are in the more danger of doing hurt.</P>
<P>Nor can it be said that there is <HI>no example</HI> nor ground of stated and permanent Councils in the holy Scriptures, seeing the Apostles and Evangelists were so, and more, unto the Primitive Churches.</P>
<P>Hence also it was enough to give u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>one pattern</HI> of an or|dinary Council, there was no need for the continuation
<PB N="22" REF="000101_0024_0FA0290751DD7898">
thereof, whilst the Apostles and Evangelists did survive.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>But doth not this strengthen the Argument for Bishops, and such like Superintendents over the Churches? for so they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Were there a like example in an ordinary way, set down in Scripture, for this work to be done by any one <HI>Man</HI> not extraordinarily called, as there is <HI>for a Council,</HI> then their Argument would have force with it; but such a <HI>pattern,</HI> or <HI>precept</HI> for it, is not to be found. And the way of Councils, (which is clearly instituted) is sufficient to attain the end, as we have found by gracious and plenteous experience: though we are still defective, in that we have not our Councils <HI>stated,</HI> and we do finde great inconvenience by reason of that defect.</P>
<P N="12">XII. These Councils, in the time of their <HI>duration,</HI> may multiply or cut short their Sessions, as need may require, according as the business of the Churches, and affairs of Christ may be more or less pressing and urgent.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. There be <HI>two sorts</HI> of their Meetings,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Stated.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Occasional.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
The <HI>stated</HI> Meetings of the <HI>first Councils</HI> are every <HI>Moneth:</HI> and what if it should be on the first <HI>Third day</HI> of the week, in every month, through the year?</P>
<P>The <HI>stated</HI> meeting of the <HI>Provincial Councils,</HI> are once every <HI>quarter</HI>: and what if two of them be the first <HI>Third day</HI> after the Sun touches the middle point of the summer and winter <HI>Solstices</HI>? And the other two, the first <HI>Third day</HI> after the Sun is in the <HI>Vernal</HI> and <HI>Autumnal Equinoctial</HI>? With this consideration, that if the Sun touch any of these points upon the <HI>Third day</HI> of the week, then that is the day of meeting; if on any other day, then the <HI>Third day</HI> after.</P>
<P>The stated meeting of the <HI>National Council,</HI> is once a <HI>Year,</HI> and best in the Spring: and what if it be the last <HI>Third day</HI> of the <HI>First Moneth</HI> called <HI>March</HI>?</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The Law of the <HI>Constitution</HI> doth call all these Councils to meet at the stated times, without any other order or appointment.</P>
<P N="15">XV. It is very requisite that some eminent man preach a <HI>publick Lecture,</HI> on the day of the meeting of every Council, to draw many Saints together, and to raise a strong breath or Prayer, and to put the greater Solemnity upon so holy a work.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. <HI>Occasional Meetings</HI> may be multiplied either by
<PB N="23" REF="000101_0025_0FA0290805258910">
intricacy of <HI>Cases,</HI> Variety of <HI>Opinions,</HI> Troublesomeness of <HI>Persons,</HI> Danger of <HI>Churches,</HI> Gross <HI>Scandals</HI> that can|not proceed to Censure, because of some obstruction, with|out the help of <HI>Counsel.</HI></P>
<P>Such <HI>Occasional Meetings,</HI> if foreseen, may be appointed by the Council before they rise; if not foreseen, then they must be called by the <HI>Moderator</HI> then in being, and the <HI>No|tary,</HI> by Letters under either of their hands, where distance of place requireth it.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The place of Meeting for these Councils, and especially of the <HI>first Councils</HI> is not to be limited, or tyed to any <HI>one place,</HI> because there be sundry Considerations about the place, whereof one may be prevalent at one time, and another time another: Sometimes the <HI>age,</HI> and unfitness for Travel of some eminently useful person; sometimes the common conveniency for all: Sometimes it may edifie to meet in that Church where the chief Trouble may at the present be, and yet this not alwayes so, because the trou|bles of <HI>Antioch</HI> were heard and setled at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where the best and ablest Counsel was to be had, with the least trouble and inconveniency unto any.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. The generall Work of all Ecclesiasticall Councils.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Ecclesiastical Councils</HI> are to do for all the Chur|ches in an ordinary way, what the Apostles were to do in an extraordinary way. <HI>The care of all the Churches doth lye upon them,</HI> which appeareth both in the <HI>Manner</HI> of their Constitution, and <HI>End</HI> of their Meeting.</P>
<P>Yea, they are to do for <HI>all the World,</HI> what lyeth in them, as the Apostles were to do, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. <HI>Go, and teach all Nations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">I. Hence, first, if there be any Heathen people that yet know not Christ, it is a work well-becoming any of these <HI>Orders of Councils,</HI> and all of them in their harmony, to seek out, and <HI>send forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Labourers</HI> to such a work and

service of Christ, to carry the Gospel, and preach Jesus Christ unto them; to gather and <HI>plant Churches</HI> amongst them. And it is the duty of particular Churches unto whose Society such <HI>Instruments,</HI> chosen by the Councils, do belong, by <HI>Fasting and Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Imposition of hands,</HI> to send them forth unto that Work; as the Church of <HI>Antioch</HI> did unto <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI>&punc; when they were extraordinari|ly called&punc; and sent forth unto such a Work as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are now speaking of, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.2, 3. And this will be one holy wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of improvement of <HI>Church treasuries</HI>&punc; raised by voluntary Contributions, to <HI>spread</HI> and <HI>propagate the Gospel</HI> to all the World.</P>
<P N="2">II. If there be any among the profession Nations <HI>that sit in darkness, and in the region of the shadow of death, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no light,</HI> (and too many such dark Corners there be, in the Land of <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Naphthali,</HI> Mat. 4 15, 16.) who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e none to bring the glad Tidings of Light and Life unto them, at least, none that <HI>do it:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t well becometh the vigilance of these Councils to provide and send <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Instruments unto them, by whose Labours, the <HI>Light</HI> (through grace) may arise, and shine among them. And it is the duty of the Churches to send forth such persons with their prayers and blessing, as abovesaid.</P>
<P N="3">III. If there be any Sister-Church that hath <HI>no Breasts,</HI> (which, by death or other means&punc; oft-falleth out, where Churches are numerous) it is a special and proper care of the Ecclesiastical Councils, to take a prudent&punc; pious, and speedy course for their supply: It being a matter that hath a great tendency to the well-being not onely of that Church, but of the Councils also, into whose Communion all Elders are received.</P>
<P>And unto this point of their care and duty it doth be|long, sometimes to remove <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghts</HI> from one <HI>Candlestick</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o another, where the gifts and labours of some special Instr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ments may be most fruitful, to the glory of God, and the publick good of Religion, and all the Churches.</P>
<P>But this is to be done with all wisdome, tenderness&punc; and evidence of Scripture light, that it is the <HI>Wall of God,</HI> and for his <HI>Glory</HI> so to be: that so the Church concerned may yield it as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> act of obedience to Christ, for whose sake they should be willing to <HI>pluck out their right eyes</HI> and give them unto Christ, in obedience as unto the <HI>Apostles,</HI> so unto <HI>Councils</HI> their ordinary Successors.</P>

<P N="7">VII. If any <HI>Strife</HI> or <HI>Division</HI> arise among any, either <HI>per|sons,</HI> or <HI>parties,</HI> or <HI>Churches,</HI> or <HI>Towns,</HI> or <HI>Magistrates</HI>; be|cause all strife is of Satan&punc; and dangerous&punc; and the higher the worse: Therefore it ought to be the care of all the Councils, speedily to <HI>reconcile</HI> (in an Ecclesiastical way is to their spirits and affections) <HI>all such strife</HI> with all care <HI>re|fusing</HI> to interpose&punc; or meddle with the <HI>Civil cause,</HI> if any be, leaving that to be decided in Civil Order&punc; according to the Ordinance of God</P>

<P N="10">X.

And therefore it is neces|sary that they have the Ministry of Gods Word, and some other godly persons with them, who may carry on Church-work among them.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Touching the Maintenance of these Councils.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THough it be meet that all their <HI>necessary Charges</HI> be born for them; for <HI>who goeth on a warfare at his own charge?</HI> yet it is in no wise meet that any Profits or Re|venues should be annexed unto any of the <HI>Councils,</HI> from the lowest unto the highest. Worldly Profit, Power and Splen|dor are beneath the spirit and aim of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Onely the <HI>Notaries Place,</HI> being a service of much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bour, pains and diligence, it is me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t that some considera|tion be had for some convenient <HI>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompence</HI> for their <HI>labour.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. If any godly minded Christian, out of a love unto, and zeal for the honour of the Kingdome of Jesus Christ, should desire to give, and annex <HI>Maintenance</HI> unto any of these forenamed Councils, more then conveniently to bear their Charges (as Noble <HI>Constantine</HI> did for the worldly splendor of the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shops</HI>) it ought not to be <HI>permitted,</HI> but religiously opposed: for it will certainly prove an <HI>Inlet</HI> of great Corruption&punc; Ambition, Avarice, and Strife unwor|thy and unfit persons will endeavour to <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">be themselves</HI> into Places&punc; more for the <HI>Wages,</HI> then for the <HI>Work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>honour</HI> of the Service, and the <HI>glory</HI> of Christ that is upon the <HI>Messengers of the Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes,</HI> these are inse|parable from the <HI>Work</HI> and are as suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as <HI>flesh and blood</HI> (we being in the flesh, and state militant) will be able

to <HI>weather,</HI> and keep from running <HI>aground</HI> upon.</P>
<P>But <HI>Revenue</HI> and <HI>Profit</HI> are separable from the <HI>Work,</HI> and must be religiously and earnestly kept off: It being a <HI>Worm</HI> that will surely corrupt this blessed Work, and glorious Service of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. A small <HI>Revenue</HI> will maintain the government of Churches by Councils, even in a great Nation, in comparison of the vast revenues which the <HI>Antichristian Hierarchy</HI> have fatted and inriched themselves withall: which also hath advantaged them to arrogate unto themselves, and usurp civil Authority. And by these <HI>carnal A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ditta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents</HI> unto the Church, Religion hath been <HI>corrupted,</HI> most men have been <HI>damned,</HI> and <HI>few saved.</HI> Therefore the Church ought now, in our reformation and resurrection, <HI>to despise the World,</HI> and not to suffer great revenues to be annexed unto this part of the kingdome of Christ especially.</P>
<P N="5">V. The religious meetings of Councils, must be patterns of all meetings of all men, throughout the Nation: for they are many <HI>shining Lights</HI> met together, and all men will mark what they do, and one <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> of excess in them who are the Center, will be an <HI>Ell</HI> in the people.</P>
<P>Hence they must strive to be patterns to all men.</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>Gravity</HI>: not full of Mirth, Laughter and Jesting.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>Sobriety</HI>: no excess in drinking wine and strong drink.</P>
<P N="3">3. In <HI>Moderation</HI> of diet, Ornaments, or any Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p.</P>
<P N="4">4. In <HI>Sedul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI>: it is the Lords work, and <HI>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord negl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gently.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. In <HI>all Holiness of Discourse</HI> and <HI>behaviour.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Meekness of Spirit,</HI> in all matters.</P>
<P N="7">7. In <HI>Care for the publick Cause of Christ, and welfare of all the Churches,</HI> the chief ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of all which doth firstly and chiefly ly upon the Modera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Great care is to be had of the <HI>first Councils</HI> that there may be some <HI>grave</HI> and <HI>exempla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Elders</HI> in every one of them, because according to our custom, there may be sundry that are young, raw, and weak, and need to be trained up unto the gravity, prudence, and holiness of the affaires of Christ his Ecclesiastical kingdome.</P>
<P>Care is also to be had, that <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ler</HI>&punc; and <HI>Prudent Ruling Elders</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be sent&punc; such as may be an awe unto green and young Schollars&punc; where need may be.</P>
<P>Care is also to be had, that they stay no long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r then ne|cessary business, and just imployment holdeth them, that there may be no temptations like company-keeping in vanity, and smoaking away their precious time.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="38" REF="000101_0040_0FA0292EAEAD7E50">VII. Their entertainment may be 8 <HI>d. Ordinary</HI> at noon, and 6 <HI>d.</HI> at night, provided they be necessita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to tarry all night, otherwise their charges are but their dinner and horse-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat.</P>
<P>For the defraying of which charge, the <HI>Deacons</HI> of that Church where they meet, may be authorized so to order the matter with the <HI>Deacons</HI> of all the Churches in that com|bination, as that the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rge shall be by them defrayed, and not put to the accompt of any of the Elders. And by the same hands some recompence may be given to the <HI>Notaries,</HI> for their labour and service.</P>
<P>For the supply of which charge, the <HI>voluntary Contribu|tions</HI> of every Church will be such a treasury, as will never know want, so long as Religion, and love to Christ remain and rule among them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The <HI>Provincial Councils</HI> will be more choice and grave assemblies, and their treatment must be with more respect and reverence: but their expences with the like mo|deration and sobriety It is to be supposed that these dwell more remote are fuller of work, and must tarry longer.</P>
<P>If the <HI>State</HI> entertain these, and allow them 10 <HI>li.</HI> a Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sion for their four stated Sessions in a year; and 5 <HI>li.</HI> for the <HI>Notaries,</HI> it will not be a great charge.</P>
<P>And if the <HI>National Council</HI> have 100 li. <HI>per annum</HI> for their <HI>Attendance</HI> and <HI>Notaries.</HI></P>
<P>One thousand pound <HI>per annum</HI> will suffice for a great Na|tion where they may be in twenty Ecclesiastical Provinces.</P>
<P>And this charge will be less then the the revenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of some one Bishoprick. The design of <HI>Antichrist</HI> was to <HI>pamper the flesh</HI>; the design of Christ is to mortifie it, and to <HI>honour Grace.</HI></P>
