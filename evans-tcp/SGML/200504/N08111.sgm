<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Human Mind, in a State of Nature, may be justly com|pared to the Soil:&mdash;By the Improvement of the one, and the Cultivation of the other, both are rendered highly advanta|geous to Mankind, for Want whereof Error and Barbarity spring up in the first, and Briars and Thorns choak the latter.&mdash;We come into the World inveloped in a Cloud of Ignorance: Nature places almost all upon a Level, and makes no very material Difference in dispensing her Gifts.&mdash;Of all Endowments of the Mind, then, <HI>Knowledge</HI> is un|doubtedly, on every civil, as well as moral, Consideration, the greatest. To form a just Notion of the Advantages derived from it, we need only view the vast Heighth to which it raises one Part of the human Species above another; and the Distinction it makes, not only be|tween Individuals, but between Nations and Countries.&mdash;We have too many living Instances around us of the wretched State of Man|kind, uncivilized and untutored.&mdash;But if these are not sufficient, let us look back to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> now renowned and revered through|out the World, for her <HI>Wisdom, Policy, Learning,</HI> and <HI>Arts.</HI> What was she before the Light of Knowledge beamed over her its blessed Rays?&mdash;A Land of Barbarity and Error; where the miserable Inha|bitants were distinguished by nothing but a rude and savage Fierce|ness.&mdash;They knew not the GOD that made them; and were led by Ignorance to pay the Homage due to the CREATOR to some of the meanest of his <HI>Creatures.</HI>&mdash;They knew not even the Use of Cloaths; but, like the savage Natives that roam these Woods, went naked&mdash;painted their Bodies; and, by Way of Ornament, made Incisions in their Flesh, representing Trees, Flowers, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which, with the Juice of a certain Plant, they dyed of a bluish Colour, that never wore out.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="010350_0004_0F7EA1138A598558">
IF we taken a View of that immense Territory called <HI>Russia,</HI> which, for its Extent, and the late Barbarity of its Inhabitants, may be com|pared with the most uncultivated Wilds of <HI>America,</HI> what was it a few Years ago?&mdash;We are told that till the Time of Czar <HI>Peter</HI> I. the Natives were a most barbarous, rude and ignorant People.&mdash;But that great and wise Prince having travelled into <HI>England,</HI> and other Countries, in order to learn their Policy and Manners, and to improve himself in their most useful Arts and Sciences <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This powerful and mighty Emperor disdained not to work at several Trades, and to employ himself in the King's Yards, in order to learn the Art of Ship-building; such was his Thirst of Knowledge, and Desire of making his People happy.</NOTE>, returned to his Em|pire, enriched with the Knowledge and Discoveries of those Nations; and immediately applied himself to introduce Learning, by importing Books, erecting Schools, setting up Printing-Presses and Libraries.</P>
<P>THE first University that ever was in <HI>Russia</HI> is not above 25 Years old; and now <HI>Petersburgh</HI> boasts of an Academy of Sciences, which begins to vie with the most eminent in <HI>Europe;</HI> so that in a little more than half a Century, these late Barbarians have almost brought them|selves upon a Level with the most polite and learned Nations.</P>
<P>BY this we may observe, that in Proportion as Knowledge is en|couraged, and makes a Progress in any Country, it raises the Inhabi|tants from Ignorance, Obscurity, Barbarism and Error, and changes them into different Creatures.&mdash;And perhaps the Day is not far distant, when we may have the Pleasure of having this Observation verified before our Eyes;&mdash;when the rude Barbarians of our own Country may be led, by the Light of Knowledge, to lay aside their savage Na|ture; to become polished Members of Society; and even to serve the Public in some of its most honourable Offices.</P>
<P>LET us also observe, that as soon as Learning droops, or feels the Tyrant's Hand, its Votaries sink back again into their original Igno|rance and Roughness.&mdash;If we cast our Eyes towards ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> to what a Pitch of Glory and Reputation did she raise herself, by carrying the Sciences to Perfection? But as soon as they were neglected or dis|couraged, how did she dwindle again almost to nothing? And <HI>Rome,</HI> once Mistress of the World, was no less renowned for her Victories, than her extensive Learning and Knowledge <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> de Mag, Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></NOTE>: But no sooner was she
<PB N="iii" REF="010350_0005_0F7EA114481E3388">
deprived of these, than she shrunk back again into a poor petty State; so that Science and Empire sell together; which is beautifully descri|bed by the Poet.</P>
<L>" Learning <HI>and</HI> Rome <HI>alike in Empire grow,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>And</HI> Arts <HI>still follow'd where her</HI> Eagles <HI>flew,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>From the same Foes, at last both felt their Doom,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>And the same Age saw</HI> Learning <HI>fall, and</HI> Rome <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tota eris in Cineres, quasi nunquam Roma suisses.</HI></NOTE>.</L>
<BIBL>POPE'S <HI>Essay on Crit.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>Afric</HI> too, for Knowledge, was once renowned throughout the Na|tions.&mdash;She gave us our <HI>Origen, Cyprian,</HI> and <HI>Tertullian.</HI>&mdash;She brought forth many great and learned Men; but, through the Neglect of Li|terature, she has sunk into a State of Wretchedness and Barbarity, un|equalled in the World.&mdash;Alas! She is now no more than the shattered Skeleton of her former Self.&mdash;There are not so much as the Traces of Science to be found: But the once delightful Seats of Learning, and learned Men, are now trod by cruel brutish Barbarians, who have little more than the Shape of Man remaining <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some Travellers tell us, that there are Places in <HI>Africa,</HI> where there are public Shambles for Human Flesh, and that the Father eats the Son, and the Son the Father, without Horror.</NOTE>. Throughout the whole <HI>East</HI> (<HI>China</HI> excepted) there is scarce the Glimmering of Science; for as Ignorance and Slavery are Companions, the Tyrant takes Care to hold them together.&mdash;So that in all the great Empires of <HI>Morocco, Abyssinia, Persia</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> Ignorance, Misery and Bar|barity, go Hand in Hand.&mdash;In <HI>Turkey,</HI> Printing is forbid under dread|ful Penalties, lest by that Means the People should be brought to know what Slaves and Wretches they are; lest they should be brought to know that they have a Right to their Lives and Liberties; lest they should be brought to know that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was a vile Impostor, and his <HI>Alcoran</HI> a ridiculous Fable.&mdash;How happy then are they who enjoy the Means of Knowledge, and how miserable and wretched are they, who have the Misfortune to be deprived of them?</P>
<P>BUT besides the Advantages which we receive from <HI>Learning,</HI> by its enlarging our Ideas, and exalting our Natures, it inspires us with a Love of Freedom, and an Abhorrence of Slavery.&mdash;It shews us the true Value of Liberty, and how great a Price the Preservation thereof has cost our Forefathers; it points out every Invasion made upon it,
<PB N="iv" REF="010350_0006_0F7EA114EB3270F0">
and what we have an undoubted Right to do for the Security of it.&mdash;We are thereby brought to <HI>know ourselves;</HI>&mdash;we are shewn how to re|gulate our Conduct and our Passions; how to make a proper Use of our Reason; to place a proper Estimate on Persons and Things:&mdash;In short, it leads us, as it were, by the Hand, and points out the Du|ties which we owe to GOD and our Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>LET us now enquire how <HI>Knowledge</HI> is to be attained.&mdash;In early Time, before <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> were invented, the Access to Learn|ing was extremely difficult.&mdash;Laws, Rules, Doctrines, Relations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were delivered, and handed down from Father to Son by <HI>Oral Tradi|tion:</HI> But the Fallacy and Uncertainty of this Method of conveying <HI>Knowledge</HI> became so evident, that Recourse was next had to <HI>Hiero|glyphics</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Word <HI>Hieroglyphic</HI> signifies, in the Original, <HI>Holy Sculpture,</HI> and was used by the antient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> as an Emblem or Sign of some sacred or holy Thing.&mdash;Those People communicated their religious Rites, and the Mysteries of their Morality and History, to none but Kings and Priests, and such as they held divine.&mdash;And this they did by a Kind of <HI>Kabbala,</HI> which, at the same time that it instructed them, veiled their Morality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from others, and left them in Ig|norance.&mdash;Hence the Use of <HI>Hieroglyphics;</HI> which were afterwards reduced to real Characters, and applied to profane as well as sacred Things.&mdash;They are said to have been first invented by <HI>Hermes <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE>, which were a Kind of Symbols, or mystic Characters, en|graved on Monuments, Pyramids and Obelisks, used in the <HI>Heathen Theology,</HI> and from thence introduced into the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian;</HI> and afterwards reduced to certain <HI>Marks</HI> or <HI>Images,</HI> rather painted than written; and are used at this Day by our own <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;By these Images People endeavoured to express and communicate their Ideas to one another; but this Method was likewise found to be trouble|some and defective, and, like the other, became the Source of miser|able Confusion, and endless Conjecture.&mdash;When they would write an Elephant, they were under the Necessity of painting its Figure, and to signify a Forest, they were obliged to draw a Number of Trees, and so on.&mdash;Had this been the only Inconvenience (great as it was) it might have been submitted to; but they were never able to express all their Thoughts; they were liable to be continually deceived and perplexed by the Similarity of Images; and these Images took up so much Room, that large Volumes were obliged to be written, to ex|press a few Things.&mdash;Besides all these Inconveniences, they found that the <HI>Senses, Passions,</HI> and a Thousand other Objects, could never be represented by <HI>hieroglyphical Figures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="010350_0007_0F7EA115AF7110B8">
AT last they began to make simple Strokes, which became distin|guished by the Name of <HI>Characters</HI> or <HI>Letters;</HI> and by being differ|ently transposed and joined, formed Words, and became at length safe and unerring Conveyors of our Thoughts.&mdash;The Merit of this noble Invention is claimed both by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Chinese;</HI> and indeed the Merit is so great, that rather than run the Risque of de|priving the true Owner of it, it will be best to allow it to both.</P>
<P>WHEN Men came, by the Help of these Letters, to make a Col|lection of what they had experienced or invented, such Collection was called a <HI>Book.</HI>&mdash;The first Books were written or engraved on <HI>Stones,</HI> as was the <HI>Decalogue,</HI> or <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> delivered to <HI>Moses</HI> on <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> which is the oldest Book that Antiquity gives us any certain Account of.&mdash;They were afterwards written on the Bark and Leaves of Trees, and on the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Plant, called <HI>Papyrus;</HI> then on Tables of <HI>Wax, Leather, Skins</HI> of wild Beasts; after that on <HI>Lead, Linen, Silk, Horn,</HI> and at last on Paper.&mdash;But the <HI>Latin</HI> Word <HI>Liber,</HI> as well as the <HI>English</HI> Word <HI>Book</HI> (derived from the <HI>Saxon</HI> Word <HI>Boc</HI>) both signify the Bark of a Tree, on which it is probable they were chiefly wrote.</P>
<P>WE are told that the first Books were of the Shape of square Blocks or Tables.&mdash;And this Opinion is favoured by sacred Writ, in its Account of the <HI>Book</HI> of the <HI>Covenant, Book</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;When Leaves, Skins, Parchment, Linen, Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> came to be made use of, it was more convenient to make Books in Form of Rolls, from whence we have the Word <HI>Volume,</HI> which signifies to <HI>roll up.</HI>&mdash;This Method is still used by the <HI>Jews,</HI> who stitch several Skins of Parch|ment together, on which they write the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> or five Books of <HI>Moses,</HI> and roll them round a Cylinder of Wood, Ivory, Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all the Aids that <HI>Knowledge</HI> derived from the Discovery of Letters, it made but slow Advances in the World.&mdash;There was something still wanting to forward its Progress: For as these Books were obliged to be written or engraved by the Hand, they were held at such a Price, that none but Princes, and Persons of the greatest Opulence, were able to procure them; so that the rest of the World were still left to grope through their original Ignorance and Darkness.&mdash;This left Room for new Invention, and at last the Art
<PB N="vi" REF="010350_0008_0F7EA11793501398">
of <HI>Printing</HI> was found out, about 316 Years ago.&mdash;<HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Stras|burg,</HI> two Cities of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Haerlem,</HI> a considerable Town in <HI>Holland,</HI> claim severally the Merit of this happy Discovery, which is one of the greatest Blessings that Mortals could receive!&mdash;<HI>John Faust, John Guttemberg,</HI> and <HI>Peter Scheoffer,</HI> of <HI>Mentz, John Mental,</HI> of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Coster,</HI> of <HI>Haerlem,</HI> have all stood Candi|dates for this Honour; and the World has not yet agreed to which of them it ought to be ascribed:&mdash;<HI>Guttemberg,</HI> however, seems to have the most Votes in his Favour; and certain it is that <HI>Scheoffer</HI> first invented the Method of founding <HI>moveable</HI> Types, which was a most valuable Improvement; as <HI>Printing</HI> was at first performed by Letters engraved, or cut on Blocks and Boards of Wood.&mdash;May <Q>the Me|morial of the Man be had in everlasting Remembrance!</Q></P>
<P>THE first Books that were printed, are said to be the <HI>Catholicon,</HI> a <HI>Latin Bible,</HI> and <HI>Tully'</HI>s <HI>Offices.</HI>&mdash;But by this last glorious Discovery, Books soon became plentiful and cheap; and the Avenues to Know|ledge were made smooth and easy to all.&mdash;The Labours, Thoughts, Inventions and Skill of the <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Virtuous,</HI> of different Nations, have been laid at our Doors; and even the <HI>Husbandman</HI> and <HI>Mecha|nic,</HI> without neglecting their necessary Callings, may now taste the Fruits of literary Leisure.</P>
<P>COLLECTIONS of Books have been made by every civilized Na|tion in the World: And <HI>Libraries</HI> have been, and are now promoted and encouraged by all, who ever knew the Value of being ranked in the Number of <HI>intelligent Beings.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Hebrews</HI> are said to be the first who established <HI>Libraries</HI> and that other Nations took the Hint from them.</P>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Ezra</HI> gives us an Account of a Library belonging to the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> which the <HI>Sacred Scripture</HI> emphatically calls a <HI>Treasure-House</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezra</HI> v. 17.</NOTE> We have also an Account of a Library built by the Prophet <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in which the Books of <HI>David,</HI> and the Pro|phecies, were reposited.</P>
<P><HI>PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS,</HI> by whose Order the <HI>Greek</HI> Translation of the Bible is said to have been undertaken by the LXX Interpreters, founded a Library at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> that contained 700,000 Volumes, which was burnt by <HI>Coesar'</HI>s Army <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Omar'</HI>s Lieutenants, says <HI>Voltaire.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="010350_0009_0F7EA1188154E1A0">
AT <HI>Pergamus,</HI> we are informed, there was a Library which con|tained 200,000 Books.</P>
<P><HI>CONSTANTINE the Great,</HI> who was the first <HI>Christian Em|peror</HI> in the World, had a Library of 300,000 Volumes, among which were <HI>Homer'</HI>s inimitable Poems, called the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey,</HI> written on the Guts of a Serpent, in Letters of Gold, which were all burnt by the cruel Tyrant <HI>Leo</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Leo</HI> was originally a Pedlar of <HI>Isauria;</HI> but being raised to Purple and Empire, ordered twelve venerable Ecclesiastics, and all their Books, to be burnt together.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Palatine</HI> and <HI>Ulpian Libraries,</HI> and that of <HI>Paulus AEmilius,</HI> are reckoned to have been the most famous of antient <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>IT was customary in former Times, for every large Church to have a Library belonging to it.&mdash;The <HI>Vatican</HI> was a very considerable One, which was destroyed in the Sacking of <HI>Rome;</HI> but afterwards was re|newed with the Books which <HI>Count Tilly</HI> plundered and carried away from <HI>Heidelburg.</HI></P>
<P>AT <HI>Florence</HI> a most valuable Library was founded by <HI>Cosmo de Me|dicis,</HI> which consisted of many Thousand Volumes.</P>
<P>BUT the most considerable Libraries now in <HI>Europe</HI> are those of the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which is said to contain above 80,000 Volumes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;That of the <HI>French</HI> King, at <HI>Paris.</HI>&mdash;And the <HI>Bodleian</HI> and <HI>Harleian</HI> Libraries, belonging to the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> which are the largest and most compleat of any belonging to any Seminary of Learning in Christendom.</P>
<P>THERE are also many other considerable Libraries in <HI>England;</HI> such as the <HI>Cotton-Library,</HI> and those belonging to the <HI>Middle Temple, Sion College, Merchant Taylor'</HI>s <HI>School, College of Physicians, Royal So|ciety, Paul'</HI>s <HI>School, Christ'</HI>s <HI>Hospital,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>INDEED, the World in general is now happily stored with Collec|tions of choice and valuable Books, in every Language, for the Ad|vancement of Arts and Sciences; and the more of this <HI>Treasure</HI> any Community enjoys, the richer in useful Knowledge must she be.&mdash;She will be revered by the Nations around her; and her Members, when called forth to exert their natural as well as improved Abilities in the Service of the Public, or for the Advantage of Mankind, will <HI>shine as Lights in the World.</HI></P>

<P>REPOSITARIES of the united Labours of the Wise and Learn|ed, are certainly the first and most proper Means of making Men knowing and useful: And they so manifestly tend to enrich, exalt and ennoble the human Mind, that the Love or Contempt of them, may be a proper Criterion between Goodness of Heart, and its Contrary: For certain it is, that the Promotion of useful Knowledge is an Un|dertaking truly virtuous and Praise-worthy, and such as flows from the generous Breast alone;&mdash;and that the Patrons and Encouragers thereof ever have been, and, we hope, ever will be, deemed the great Friends of Mankind.</P>

<P>SMITH'<HI>s Poem on Visit. Acad. of</HI> Philadelphia. In this glorious Contest the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> claims no small Degree of Merit.&mdash;Her College at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> has already sent forth several excellent young Men, who are become useful Members of the Community, and now serve the Public, in some of its most honour|able Stations, with Credit and Applause.&mdash;She has also distinguished herself in her Attention to public Libraries, there not being less than four in the Metropolis, and in almost every Town of Note, one.</P>
<P>The <HI>Juliana Library</HI> in <HI>Lancaster,</HI> is yet in its Infancy, and has nothing to boast of, except the Notice and Encouragement it has re|ceived from <HI>Persons,</HI> whose Names would do Honour to any Insti|tution;&mdash;and that the Means of Knowledge are thereby brought the nearest <HI>Westwardly,</HI> of any that we know of, to the Borders of <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Barbarity;</HI> which may excite others still nearer, to catch the Ex|ample, and carry Knowledge by Degrees to the very Doors of the poor untutored and unenlightened <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Consideration alone, it is humbly presumed, will entitle it to some Regard.&mdash;But besides this, the County of <HI>Lancaster</HI> is re|markable for the Richness of its Soil, and the Number and Industry of its Inhabitants.&mdash;The People seem to have a particular Genius for <HI>Agriculture,</HI> and the <HI>Mechanic Arts</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>THIS County is very extensive; and in Point of Opulence, has the Preference over every other County in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> excluding that of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI>&mdash;Its Number of Inhabitants is computed to be 40,000 Souls.&mdash;The Fertility of the Soil, which is every where plentifully supplied with Meadow and Water, renders the Lands here extremely valuable, which are capable of the highest Improvement.</P>
<P>The Culture of <HI>Hemp,</HI> and <HI>Hops,</HI> seems to be much attended to by the Farmers of this County, who annually send large Quantities of both these Articles to the Metropolis.&mdash;&mdash;The Number of Waggons continually employed in carrying the Produce of this Place to Market is incredible.&mdash;&mdash;The Inhabitants are chiefly <HI>Germans,</HI> to whose Oeconomy, unwearied Labour, and Industry, the County is principally indebted for the Wealth and Reputation is so deservedly possesses.</P>
<P>The County Town (which in the Year 1742 was incorporated into a Borough, with a Power of holding Fairs and Markets, &amp;c.) contains at least 600 Houses, many of which are extremely neat, and make a good Appearance, being built of Brick, and cut Stone.&mdash;&mdash;It contains, at a moderate Medium of five to a Family, about 3000 Souls.&mdash;&mdash;The Lowness and Unevenness of its Situation, is amply compensated by its Convenience for Trade.</P>
<P>Amongst the public Buildings, there are seven Places of Worship.&mdash;&mdash;Of these the <HI>New German Lutheran-Church is justly esteemed one of the most elegant and finished Pieces of Architecture in the Province.</HI>&mdash;&mdash;There are three regular <HI>Fire Companies established here,</HI> who have two good Fire En|gines, &amp;c. and meet once a Month to <HI>examine</HI> into the State of the Houses, and to devise Methods for the more effectual Preservation of them from the dreadful Accidents of Fire.</P>
<P>This Town has, for many Years, supported a good <HI>Grammar School,</HI> which is now likely to be reduced for want of proper Encouragement; though no Place seems better calculated for an In|stitution of this Kind, as it enjoys a pure Air, a remarkably healthy Situation, and a Plentiful Market, besides many other Advantages.</P>
<P>In the Mechanic Arts this Place also produces many ingenious Workmen, some of which are deemed not interior to any in the Province, who have exhibited sufficient Proofs ot their Skill in their respective Occupations.&mdash;On the whole, it may be observed, without incurring the Centure of Partiality, that <HI>Lancaster</HI> stands foremost of all the other <HI>In-land Towns</HI> on the Continent of <HI>America.</HI></P></NOTE>; which may be greatly im|proved and encouraged by Books.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="010350_0012_0F7EA11BDF402EE0">
IT is by no Means intended or meant, that such Persons as those described above, should sit down in a Library, and become <HI>studious.</HI>&mdash;All Men are not born nor fitted, and if they were, all Men could not be spared, for such an Employment; but yet every Man has Leisure to read some, without breaking in upon his necessary Calling, more easy and advantageous to him.&mdash;He may view the Schemes of Millions that have gone before him in the same Art, compare them with his own, and put in Practice <HI>that</HI> which he thinks best.&mdash;An Application of this Kind will be so far from being useless or improper to the in|dustrious <HI>Husbandman,</HI> or ingenious <HI>Artist,</HI> that it will sweeten his Toil, and repay him with Pleasure and Profit: But besides this, if such a Person should at any time be called to the Seat of Justice, or the House of Legislation, will he not find it necessary to have some Acquaintance with Books? It was common in antient <HI>Rome,</HI> to have Dictators and Consuls brought from the Plow, whose Hands, grown hard by labouring in the Field, often supported the tottering State, and saved the Commonwealth.</P>
<L>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"<HI>The sacred Plow</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>Employ'd the Kings and Fathers of Mankind,</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>In ancient Times</HI>"&mdash;&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>THOMSON'<HI>s Spring.</HI></BIBL>
<P>It would be absurd to suppose, that those Men paid no Regard to <HI>Books,</HI> or took no Pains to acquire <HI>Knowledge,</HI> which must necessa|rily fit them for such Stations.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="010350_0013_0F7EA11CE8766218">
Now if such Advantages accrue to the busy Husbandman and Mechanic, by reading a little, how great must be the Advantage to those who have Time and Leisure to read much! They have an Op|portunity of travelling, as it were, into distant Regions; of conver|sing with their Inhabitants; of comparing their Laws, Customs and Religion, with their own; of hearing their Disputations and Argu|ments; of being Witnesses of all their glorious Actions and At|chievments.&mdash;They have an Opportunity of entering into Society with the most renowned, of keeping Company with the best and most vir|tuous, and of <HI>holding high Converse</HI> with the most learned Sages of An|tiquity; by whose Examples they may be fired to imitate every Thing that is great and good, and from whom they may derive that noble Magnanimity of Soul, that Disinterestedness, that Hatred of Injustice, and that Love for the Public Good, which shine forth, and make so glorious a Figure, in every Part of their Lives.</P>
<P>THESE, and many more, are the Advantages derived from Books. They tend to divert from Idleness, Debauchery and Vice, and to fill up usefully those vacant Hours, which, without their Assistance, are in a Manner the Grave of a Man who lives unemployed.&mdash;They fill the Mind with Content, Satisfaction and Pleasure, which Wealth, Riches, and even Grandeur often deny.&mdash;And they bestow a Comfort and Tranquility, when the Duties of civil Life are finished.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE JULIANA LIBRARY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1759, three or four Persons of the Borough of <HI>Lan|caster,</HI> considering the great Advantages of public Libraries, con|ferred together, and engaged to sollicit Subscriptions, to establish one in that Town.</P>
<P>THEIR Proposal was so well received, that a few generous Gen|tlemen immediately subscribed, and paid <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> each, towards promoting this useful Design.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by so good a Beginning, it was resolved, that no Subscription under <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> should entitle a Person to a Share. The Number of Subscribers soon amounted to 58; and the Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Pounds Sterling</HI> was raised.</P>
<P>THE Subscribers formed themselves into a Company, and agreed to be governed by a Sett of Articles or Constitutions, entered into, and signed by the whole.</P>
<P>THE first Parcel of Books and Instruments imported from <HI>England,</HI> amounted to <HI>Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling,</HI> besides several purchased in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> &amp;c. and those received as Benefactions.</P>
<P>THE Honourable <HI>THOMAS PENN,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the Pro|prietaries of this Province, to whom the Company are much obliged for the kind Notice he has been pleased to take of them, upon being made acquainted with the Design of erecting a public Library here, wrote the following polite Letter to the Directors thereof.</P>

<P><HI>To the Directors of the</HI> Library Company <HI>at</HI> Lancaster.</P>
<P>THIS Honourable Gentleman and his Lady, have favoured the Company with several generous Donations, as appears by the List.</P>
<P>THE Honourable <HI>James Hamilton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late Governor of the Pro|vince, gave them also the Sum of <HI>Twenty Pounds Sterling,</HI> to be laid out in Books.</P>
<P>UNDER these Encouragements the Company, finding their Li|brary encreasing, and growing into Credit and Reputation, applied for, and obtained a <HI>Charter,</HI> in the Year 1763,&mdash;which was framed and drawn up gratis, by <HI>Edward Shippen,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> whose kind Offices on that Occasion, the Directors take this Opportunity of acknowledging.</P>
<P>IN Honour of Lady <HI>JULIANA PENN,</HI> and as a Testimo|ny of the high Obligations they are under to her, the Company de|sired to be, and were incorporated by the Name of the JULIANA LIBRARY-COMPANY IN LANCASTER.&mdash;And as the Charter im|powered them to use one common Seal in their Affairs, they chose the following Device, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Minerva</HI> leading an illiterate Person with one Hand, and pointing with the other to a Shelf of Books, and Pair of Globes&mdash;with the Motto, <HI>Ecce Comites Itineris;</HI> and round the Margin this Inscription, <HI>Seal of the</HI> JULIANA LIBRARY, <HI>Lan|caster.</HI></P>

THE Number of Members now amount to <HI>Seventy-seven,</HI> and are never to exceed <HI>One Hundred.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Member has an absolute Property in his Share of the Books and Effects of the Company, and may devise it by Will, or dispose of it to any Person the Directors approve of, provided the Member so sell|ing be about to remove from the County of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>THE Effects of the Company are now valued at about <HI>Six Hundred Pounds</HI> Currency.&mdash;So that a Share which at first was obtained for <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> is at present worth near <HI>Eight Pounds,</HI>&mdash;and increases yearly in Value <HI>Seven Shillings and Six-pence.</HI>&mdash;So much being yearly added by each Subscriber to the Capital Stock.</P>
<P>THE Library is at present kept in a large Chamber rented for that Purpose, where Attendance is given by the Librarian every <HI>Saturday,</HI> from Four o'Clock till Seven.</P>
<P>THIS Institution has been managed hitherto with Harmony and Success; and it is hoped that no ill-natured Accidents will intervene to interrupt a Scheme founded on virtuous Principles, and a public-spirited Design.</P>
<P>THE Company retain a proper Sense of, and acknowledge with Gratitude, the Favours they have received from the several Benefactors of this Library; and will ever be ready to enter upon their Records, and to preserve the Names of such Persons as have already, or that may hereafter honour them with any Donations in Books, Instruments, natural Curiosities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that Posterity may see who have been Patrons and Encouragers of this useful Undertaking.</P>
