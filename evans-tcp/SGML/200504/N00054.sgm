<P>THe knowledge of Divinity is necessary for all sorts of men, both to settle and establish the good, and to convert and fetch in the bad.

<P>Now spiritual Truths are either such as tend to enlarge the understanding, or such as may work chiefly upon the affections.

<P>_THIS is the first Divine Truth, and there are these two parts considerable in it.</P>
<P N="1">1 That there is a <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That this God is <HI>most glorious.</HI></P>
<P>I will begin with the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and prove (omitting many philosophical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rguments) that there is a God, <HI>a true God</HI>; for every Nation almost in the world, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">til Christs coming, had a several God, Some worship|ped the Sun, some the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, called by <HI>Ezekiel, The Queen of heaven</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. lib. 1. na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<PB N="2" REF="000093_0006_0FA015AB41A77E10">
Idols, of mans invention, as the igno|rant: or <HI>God and Angels</HI> in those Idols, as the learned did: but these are all false Gods.</P>
<P>I am now to prove that <HI>there is one true God,</HI> the being of beings, or the first be|ing. Although the proving of this point seems needless, because every man runs with the cry, and saith, <HI>There is a God,</HI> yet few throughly believe this point. Many of the children of God, who are best able to know mens hearts, because they only study their hearts, feel this tempations; <HI>is there a God</HI>? bitterly assaulting them sometimes. The devil will sometimes undermine, and seek to blow up the strongest walls &amp; bul|warks. The light of nature indeed showes that there is a God: but how many are there, that by foul sins against their con|science, blow out and extinguish almost all the light of nature? And hence, thogh they dare not conclude, because they have some light, though dim&punc; yet if they saw their heart, they might see it secretly suspect and question, <HI>Whether there be a God</HI>? But grant that none questions this truth, yet we that are builders, must not fall to a work without our main props and pillars. It may appear therefore, that there is a God, from these grounds.</P>
<P>First, <HI>from the works of God, Rom.</HI> 1.20. when we see a stately house, although we see not the man that built it, although also
<PB N="3" REF="000093_0007_0FA015AC0092DDA8">
we know not the time when it was built, yet will we conclude thus. Surely some w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se Artificer hath been working here. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we when we behold the stately theater of Hea|ved and Earth conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ude other but that the finger arms, and wisdom of God hath been here, although we see not him tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is invi|sible, and although we know not the time when he began to build? Every creature in heaven and earth is a loud preacher of this truth. Who set those candles, those torches of heaven on the table? Who hung out those lanterns in heaven to enlighten a dark world? Who can make the stature of a man but one wiser then the stone out of which it is hewen? Could any frame a man, but one wiser and greater then man? Who taught the birds to build their nests, and the bees to set up and order their Com|mon-wealth? Who sends the Sun post from one end of heaven to the other, carrying so many thousand blessings to so many thou|sands of people and Kingdoms? What power of man or angels, can make the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ile of grass, or put life into the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st flie, if once dead? There is therefore a power above all created power, which is God.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>from the Word of God.</HI> There is such a majesty stirring, and such secrets revealed in the word, that if men will not be wilfully blind, they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">not but cry out. <HI>The voice of God, and not the voice of man.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="000093_0008_0FA015ACBB05AE20">
Hence Calvin undertakes to prove the Scripture to be the Word of God, by rea|son, against all Atheists under heaven. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st thou not thought sometimes at a Ser|mon, the Minister <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath spoken to none but thee, and that some or other hath told the Minister what thou hast sad, what thou hast done, what thou hast thought? Now that word which tells thee the thoghts of thy heart, can be nothing else but the word of an all-seeing God that searcheth the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P>Again, that word which quickeneth the dead is certainly God Word; but the word of God ordinarily preached, quickneth the dead&punc; it maketh the blind to see, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he dumb to speak, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk; those that never felt thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sins to load them, to mourn; those that never cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d pray, to breath out unutterable groans and sighs for their sins.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>from the children begotten of God.</HI> For we may read in mens foreheads, as soon as ever they are born, the sentence of death: and we may see by mens lives, what hellish hearts they have. Now there is a time that some of this monstrous brood of men, are quite changed, &amp; made all new: they have new minds, new opi|nions, new desires, new joys, new sorrows, new speeches, new prayers, new lives, and such a difference there is betwixt these and others, that they are hated by others, who

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ved them well while they loved their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins: and whence came this strange change? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it from themselves? No: for they hated this new life, &amp; these new men once them|selves. Is it because they will be credited thereby? No: is it to be hated of father, mother, friends, &amp; maligned every where? Is it out of simplicity? Or are their brains grown crazie? They were indeed once fools, &amp; <HI>I</HI> can prove them all to be <HI>Solomons fools</HI>: but eve~ simple men have been known to be more wise for the world, after they have been made new. But lastly, is it now from a slavish fear of hell, which works this alteration? Nothing less: they abhor to live like slaves in Bridewell, to do all for fear of the whip.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>from Gods Register or Nota<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e which is in everie man</HI>: I mean the con|science of men, which telleth them there is a God; and although they silence it some|times, yet in thunder-time, or great plague, as <HI>Pharao</HI>; or at the day of death, then they are near Gods Tribunal, when they ac|knowledge him clearly.

<P N="2">2. In his <HI>affections,</HI> the Image of God chiefly appeared in two things.</P>
<P>First, as God seeing himself, loved him|self: So <HI>Adam</HI> seeing God, loved this God more then the world, more then himself; as yron put into the fire seems to be no|thing but fire; so <HI>Adam</HI> being beloved of God, was turned into a lump of love, to love God again:</P>

The world hath raised up many false re|ports of holy courses, calling it folly and preciseness, pride, hypocrisie, and that whatsoever shows men may make, they are as bad as the worst, if their sins were written in their fore-heads. Hence it co|meth to pass, that many a man, who is almost perswaded to be a new man, and to turn over a new leaf, dares not, will not for shame of the world, enter upon religious courses: What will they think of me then? saith he&punc; Men are ashamed to refuse to drink healths, and hence maintain them lawful.

O fearful! Is it a shame to be like God? O sinful wretches!

A wicked man cannot speak one good word, or do any good action, if heaven it self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id lye at stake for doing of it, nor offer to shake off his sins, nor

Indeed he may speak and think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good things, but he can|not have good speeches, nor good thoghts: as in holy man may think of evil things, as of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the times, yet the thought of those evil things i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good, not evil, so <HI>&egrave; contra.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, a dead man feareth no dan|gers, <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="use"> though never so great, though never so near. Let Ministers bring a natural man tydings of the approach of the devou|ring plagues of God denounced, he feareth them not.</P>
<P>Thirdly, a dead man cannot be drawn <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="use"> to accept of the best offers. Let Christ come out of heaven, and fall about the neck of a natural man, and with tears in his eyes beseech him to take his blood, himself, his Kingdom, and leave his sins, he cannot receive this offer.</P>
<P>Fourthly, a dead man is stark blind, <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="use"> and can see nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 23.37.38.</NOTE> and stark deaf and hears nothing: he cannot taste any thing; so a natural man is stark blind, he seeth no God, no Christ, no wra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of the Al|mighty, no glory of heaven: He heareth the voice of a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but he heareth not the voice of God in a Sermon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avoreth not the things of Gods Spirit.</P>

<P>Sixthly, a dead man is a speechlesse man, he cannot speak, unlesse it be like <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="use"> a parrat.</P>
<P>Seventhly, he is a breathlesse man: a natural man may say a prayer, or devise <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="use"> a prayer out of his memory and wit, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may have few short-winded wishes; but to pour out his soul in prayer, in the bosom of God, with groans unutterable, he cannot. I wonder not to see so many families without family prayer: Why? They are dead men, and ly rotting in their sins.</P>
<P>Eightly, a dead man hath lost all beau|ty; <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="use"> so a meer natural man, hath lost all glory: He is an ugly creature in the sight of God, good men and angels, and shall one day be an abhorring to all flesh.</P>

<P>Lastly, dead men want nothing but <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="use"> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing into the grave; so there wanteth nothing but casting into hell for a natural man.

<P>In three things principally.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE></P>
<P>First, no unregenerate man, though he <MILESTONE N="1"> go never so far, let him do never so much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where|in a child of God goeth beyond an hypo|crite.</NOTE> but he liveth in some one sin or other, secret or open, little or great. <HI>Judas</HI> went far, but he was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vetous. <HI>Herod</HI> went far, but he loved his <HI>Herodias.</HI> Every dog hath his kennel, every swine hath his swill, and every wicked man his lust: for no unregenerate man hath fruition of God to content him.

Yes, say they, who can live without sin? So they give way to sin, and therefore live in sin: Nay, commonly all the duties, prayers, care, and zeal of the best hypo|crites, are to hide a lust, as the whore in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> that wipeth her mouth, and goeth to the Temple, and payeth her vows: O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to feed their lusts, as <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> zeal against <HI>Baal,</HI> was to get a Kingdom, There remaineth a root of bitterness in the best hypocrites, which howsoever it be lopt off sometimes by sickness, or horror of conscience; and a man hath purposes ne|ver to commit it again, yet there it secret|ly lurketh: and though it seemeth to be bound, and conquered by the <HI>Word</HI>; or by <HI>prayer,</HI> or by outward <HI>crosses,</HI> or while the hand of God is upon a man, yet the inward strength and power of it remaineth still: and therefore when temptations, like strong <HI>Philisti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> are upon this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n again he breaketh all vows, promises, bonds of God, and will save the life of his sin.</P>
<P><MILESTONE>Secondly, no unregenerate man or wo|man ever came to be poor in spirit, and so to be carried out of all duties unto Christ: if it were possible for them to for|sake and break loose for ever from all sin, yet here they stick, as the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pha+risees,</HI> and so like zealous <HI>Paul,</HI> before hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conversion, they fasted, and prayed, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> kept the Sabbath, but they rested in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

He will answer: <HI>I pray, read, hear, love good men; cry out of the sins of the time.</HI> And tell him again, that an hypocrite may climb these staires, and go as far. He will reply, True indeed, but they do not what they do with a sound heart, but to be seen of men.

themselves by their gifts of <HI>knowledge,</HI> gifts of <HI>memorie,</HI> gifts of <HI>prayer:</HI> and when they see they must die for their sins, this is the ruine of many a soul, that though he forsake <HI>Egypt,</HI> and his sins, and flesh-pots there; and will never be so as he hath been, yet he never cometh into <HI>Canaan,</HI> but looseth himself and his soul in a wilderness of many <HI>duties,</HI> and there perisheth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, if any unregenerate man come unto Christ, he never getteth into Christ; that is, never taketh up his <HI>eternal rest,</HI> and lodging in any thing else but Jesus Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Judas followed Christ</HI> for the bag&punc; he would have <HI>the bag,</HI> and Christ too.

They will not content themselves with Christ alone, nor with the world alone, but make their markets out of both, like whor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh wives, that will please their husbands and others too. Men in distress of conscience, if they have comfort from Christ, they are con|tented: if they have salvation from hell by Christ, they are contented: but Christ himself contenteth them not.

<P>First, by reason of that bloody black <HI>ignorance</HI> of men, whereby thousands re|main wofully ignorant of their spiritual estate, not knowing how the case stan|deth between God and their souls; but
<PB N="124" REF="000093_0107_0FA0164801AE1590">
thinking themselves to be well enough already, they never seek to come out of their misery, till they perish in it.</P>
<P>Secondly, by reason of mans <HI>carnal se|curity,</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"> putting the evil day far from them, whereby they feel not their fearful thral|dom, and so never groan to come out of the slavish bondage of sin and Satan.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Thirdly, by reason of mans <HI>carnal con|fidence,</HI> whereby they shift to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve them|selves by their own duties and performan|ces when they feel it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, by reason of mans bold <HI>pre|sumption,</HI> <MILESTONE N="4"> whereby men scramble to save themselves by their own seeming faith, when they see an insufficiency in duties, and an unworthiness in themselves for God to save them.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> will begin with the first reason, and discover the first train whereby men blow up themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Igno|rance the first ge|neral reason of mans ruine.</NOTE> which is this: They know not their misery, not that fearful acccursed forlorn estate wherein they ly; but think and say, they shal do as well as others; and therefore when any friend perswadeth them to come out of it, and showeth them the danger of remaining in such a condition: What is their an|swer? <HI>I pray you, save your breath to cool your broth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> verie fat shal stand on his own bottom: Let me alone, I hope I have a soul to save as well as you, and shal be

God be merciful unto us: if all this be true, here is harsh doctrine enough, to make a man run out of his wits, and to drive men to despair. Thus they know not their misery; and not knowing, they are lost and condemned crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ures under the everlasting wrath o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God. They ne|ver <HI>seek, pray, strive</HI>&punc; or follow the means whereby they may come out of it, and so perish in it, and never know it, till they awake with the flames of hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about their ears. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey will acknowledge indeed, ma|ny of them, that all men are born in a most miserable estate, but they never ap|ply particularly that general truth to them|selves, saying, <HI>I am the man.</HI> I am now under Gods wrath, and may be snatcht a|way by death eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie hour, and then I am undone and lost for ever.</P>
<P>Now, there are two sorts of people that are ignorant of this their misery.</P>
<P>First, the common sort of prophane, blockish, ignorant people.</P>
<P>Secondly, the finer sort of unsound hol|low professors, that have a peacoks pride,
<PB N="126" REF="000093_0109_0FA0164A4772D858">
that think themselves fair, and in a very good estate, though they have but one feather on their brest to boast of.</P>
<P>I will begin with the first sort, and show you the reasons why they are igno|rant of their misery, that is for these four reasons.</P>
<P>First, sometimes because they want the saving means of knowledge. There is no faithful Minister, no compassionate <HI>Lot,</HI> to tell them of fire and brimstone from heaven, for their crying sins. There is no <HI>Noah</HI> to forwarn them of a flood: There is no messenger to bring them tydings of those armies of Gods devouring plagues and wrath, that are appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ching near un|to them, They have no pilots, poor for|saken creatures, to show them their rocks. They have either no Minister at all to reach them, either because the Parish is too poor, or the Church-living too great to maintain a faithfull man (the strongest asses car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying the greatest burthens com|monly (O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ful Physitians! Sometimes they be prophane, and cannot heal them|selves, and sometimes they be ignorant. And know not what to preach, unless they should follow the steps of Master <HI>Latimers</HI> Fryer, or at the best, they shoot off a few pot guns against gross sins: or if they do show men their misery, they lick them whole again, with some com|table
<PB N="127" REF="000093_0110_0FA0164B19DBF6F0">
ill applyed sentences: (but <HI>I</HI> hope better things of you, my brethren) the mans Patron may haply storm else. Or else they say commonly, thou hast sinned, but comfort thy self, despair not, Christ hath suffered: And thus skin over the wound, and let it fester within, for want of cutting it deeper. I say therefore be|cause they want a faithful watch man to cry, <HI>Fire, fire,</HI> in that sleepy estate of sin and darkness wherein they ly; therefore whole Towns, Parishes, generations of men, are burnt up, and perish miserably, <HI>Lament.</HI> 2.14.</P>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">condly, because they have no leasure to consider of their misery, when they have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> means of revealing it unto them, as <HI>Felix, Acts</HI> 24.25. Many a man hath many a bitter pill given him at a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmon, but he hath not leasure to chow upon it.

<PB N="128" REF="000093_0111_0FA0164D0DCF2800">
The Minister cryeth and knocketh with|out, but there is such a noise and number of tumultuous lusts and vain thoughts in their hearts and heads, that all good thoughts are sad unwelcome guests, and are knockt down presently.</P>
<P>Thirdly, because if they have leasure, they are afraid to know it. Hence people cry out of Ministers, that they dam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all, and will hear them no more, and they will not be such fools as to believe all that such say; the reason is, they are afraid to know the worst of themselves; they are afraid to be cut, and therefore cannot en|dure the Chirurgien; They think to be troubled in mind, as othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are, is the ve|rie high rode to despair; and therefore if they do hear a rale, how one after hearing of a Sermon grew distracted, or drowned, or hanged himself, it shall be an <HI>item,</HI> and a warning to them, as long as they live, for troubling their heads about such mat|ters.

estates through false glasses, and by vertue of manie false principles in their minds, they cheat themselves.</P>
<P>Which false principles, are these prin|cipally: I will but name them.</P>
<P>First, they conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve, God that made <MILESTONE N="1"> them, will not be so cruel as to damn them.</P>
<P>Secondly, because they feel no misery,<MILESTONE N="2"> but are very well, therefore they fear none.</P>
<P>Thirdly, because God blesseth them <MILESTONE N="3"> in their outward estates, in their corn, children, calling, friends, &amp;c. would God bless them so if he did not love them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, because they think sin to be no great evil, for all are sinners, for this cannot mischieve them.</P>
<P>Fifthlie, because they think Gods mer|cy <MILESTONE N="5:"> is above all his works, though sin be vile, yet conceiving God to be all mercie, all honey, and no justice, they think they are well.</P>
<P>Sixthly, because they think Christ died for all sinners, and they confess themselves <MILESTONE N="6"> to be great ones.</P>
<P>Seventhly, because they hope well, and <MILESTONE N="7"> so think to have well.</P>

<P>Ninthly, because their <HI>desires</HI> and <HI>hearts</HI> are good, as they think.</P>
<P>Tenthly, because they do as well as God will give them grace, and so God is in the fault only, if they perish.</P>

<P>Thirdly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and secret distempers of the <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P>First, there are these seven drunken di|stempers in the <HI>understanding or mind of man,</HI> whereby he cometh to be most mise|rably deceived.</P>
<P>First, the understandings <HI>arrogancie.</HI> You shal never see a man mean and vile in his own eyes deceived, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.9. but a proud man or woman is often cheated. Hence proud <HI>Haman</HI> thought surelie he was the man <HI>whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> King would ho|nor,</HI> when in truth it was intended for poor <HI>Mordecay.</HI> For pride having once over-spread the mind, it ever hath this propertie, it maketh a pennie stand f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r a pound: a spark is blown up to a flame: it maketh a great matter of a little seeming grace: and therefore the proud <HI>Pharisee,</HI> when he came to reckon with himself, he taketh his poor counter, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <HI>I am not as other men,</HI> nor as this <HI>Publican</HI> and setteth it down for a thousand pound; that is, he esteemeth of himself, as a verie rich man for it. So many a man, because he hath some good thing in himself, as, he is pitiful to the poor, he is a true man, though a poor man, he was never given to wine of women. He magnifieth him|self for this tittle, and so deceiveth and

over-reckoneth himself. There are your <HI>Bristow</HI>-stones like diamonds, and man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cheaters cozen Countrey folks with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that desire to be fine, and know not what diamonds are. So many men are desi|rous to be honest, and to be reputed so not knowing what true grace means: therefore <HI>Bristow</HI>-stones are pearles in their eyes. A litle seeming grace shineth so bright in their eyes, that they are half bewitched by it, to think highly of them|selves, although they be but glittering seeming jewels in a swines snout. A cab of doves dung was sold in <HI>Samaria</HI> in its time of famine, at a great rate: A man li|ving in such a place, where all about him are either <HI>ignorant,</HI> or <HI>prophane,</HI> or <HI>civil,</HI> a little moral honesty (dung, in respect of true grace) goeth a great way, and is esteemed highly off, and he is as honest a man as ever lived. A man that looketh through a red glass, all things appear red: A man looking upon himself through some fair spectacles, through some one good thing that he hath in himself, ap|peareth fair to him. It is said&punc; <HI>Luke,</HI> 20. <HI>ult.</HI> the <HI>Pharisees devoured widows hou|ses.</HI> Might not this racking of rents make them question their estates? No. Why?

but their desires are good: they talk idle|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, but they live honestly: they do ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ometimes, but they mean well. Thus when some good things are seen in them|selves, pride pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teth them with an over|weening conceit of it, and so they cozen their own souls.</P>
<P>Secondly, the understandings <HI>obstina|cie,</HI> whereby the mind having been long <MILESTONE N="2"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oted in this opinion, that I <HI>am in a good estate,</HI> will not suffer this conceit to be pluckt out of it. Now your old rooted, yet roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en professors, having grown long in a good conceit of themselves, will not believe that they have been fools all their lifetime, and therefore now must pull down, and lay the foundation again: And hence you shall hear men say of a faithfull Minister that doth convince and condemn them, and their estate, to be most woful: What? shall such an upstart teach me? Doth he think to make me dance after his pipe, and to think that all my <HI>good prayers,</HI> my <HI>faith,</HI> my <HI>charity,</HI> have been so long abominabe and vile be|fore God? No silver can bribe a man to cast away his old traditional opinions and conceits, whereby he cheateth him|self, till Christs blood do it, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 18. And hence the woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> ob|jected this against Jesus Christ, that their old Fathers worshipped in that mountain,

And are not those wares and commodities much to be suspected, nay concluded to be stark naught, which the seller will needs put upon the chap-mam, without seeing or looking on them first? It is a strong argument we produce against the Papists Religi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to be suspected to be bad, because they obtrude their opini|ons on their followers, to be believed without any hesitation or dispute about them, either before or after they have em|braced them: certainly thy old <HI>faith,</HI> thy old <HI>prayers,</HI> thy old <HI>honesty,</HI> or form of pie|ty, are counterfeit wares, that cannot en|dure searching, because thou wilt not be driven from this conceit: <HI>I am in a good estate.</HI> I have been so long of this good mind, and therefore will not begin to doubt now.

<P>Thirdly, the understandings <HI>obscurity,</HI> or ignorance of the infinite&punc; exactnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,

I <HI>was alive,</HI> saith <HI>Paul, Rom</HI> 7.9. <HI>without the Law:</HI> &amp; he giveth the reason of it, because sin did but sleep in him, like a cut-throat in an house, where all is quiet.

<P>Fourthly, the understandings <HI>security,</HI><MILESTONE N="4"> or <HI>sleepiness,</HI> whereby men never reflect upon their own actions, nor compare them with the rule: Although they have knowledge of the Law of God, yet it is with them, as it is with men that have a fair glass before them, but never behol|ding themselves in the glass, they never see their spots.

lamb Christians, that will yeeld to all the truthes delivered in a Sermon, and com|mend it too; but go away, and shake off all the truths that serve to convince them. And hence many men, when they exa|mine themselves in general, whether they have grace or no, whether they love Christ or no; they think yes, that they do with al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their hearts; yet they never have this grace, or any other, what ever they think; because they want reflecting light to judge of generals, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their own p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rticu|la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> courses.

<P>Fifthly, the understandings <HI>impeity,</HI><MILESTONE> whereby it lessens and vilifies the glorious grace of God in another; whence it comes to pass, that this deluded soul seeing none much better then himself, concludeth, <HI>If</HI> any be saved I shal no doubt be one, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.10 11.

And if he see they go be|yond him, he then turns his own ballan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e with his finger, and makes them too light, that so he himself may pass for weightie.</P>
<P>And his vilifying of them and their grace, judging them to be of no other met|tel then other men, appeareth in three particulars.</P>
<P>First, they raise up false <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Gods people, and nourish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of evil <MILESTONE N="1"> suspitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of them. If they know any sin
<PB N="140" REF="000093_0123_0FA0165B8CA2AA38">
committed by them, they will conclude&punc; they be all such. If they see no offensive sin in any of them, they are then repu|ted a pack of hypocrites. If they are not so uncharitable (having no grounds) they prophesie, they will hereafter be as bad as others, though they carry a fair flowrish now.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly, if they judge well of them, then they compare themselves to them, by taking a scantling only by their out|side, and by what they see in them; and so, like children, seeing stars a great way off, think them no bigger nor brighter then winking candles&punc; They stand a far off from seeing the inside of a child of God: they see not the glory of God fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing that Temple: they see not the sweet in|fluence they receive from heaven, and that fellowship they have with their God&punc; and hence they judge but meanlie of them, because the outside of a Christian is the worst part of him, and his glory shineth chiefly within.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Thirdly, if they see Gods people do excel them, that they have better lives and better hearts, and better knowledge, yet they will not conclude, that they have no grace; because it hath not that stamp that honest mens money hath.

And so vilifie the grace that shineth to the best men, by making this gold to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer from their own copper, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, but gradu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly: and hence they deceive themselves miserably; not bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that one (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">) or sincere Christian differeth from another in glory: <HI>I</HI> speak of those m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n only that never were fixt in so high a Sphere, as true honesty dwelleth, yet falsly fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her this bad conclusion, that they are upright for their measure, that they have not the like measure of grace received, as others have.</P>
<P>Sixth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, the understandings <HI>idolatry,</HI><MILESTONE N="6"> whereby the mind setteth up, and boweth down to a false image of grace; that is, the mind being ignorant of the height and excellencie of true grace, taketh a false scantling of it, and so imagineth and fan|cieth within it self, such a measure of com|mon grace to be true grace which the soul easily having atta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined unto, conceiveth it is in the state of grace, and so deceiveth it self miserablie, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3.</P>
<P>And the mind cometh to set up her image thus.</P>
<P>First, the mind is haunted and pursued with troublesome fears of hell: <HI>conscience</HI><MILESTONE N="1"> telleth him he hath sinned, and the <HI>Law</HI>

Hence saith he, Lord, keep my soul from these miseries: he hopeth it shal not prove so evil with him, but feareth it will.</P>
<P>Secondly, hereupon he desireth peace <MILESTONE N="2"> and ease, and some assurance of freedom from these evils. For it is an hell above ground, ever to be on the wrack of tor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nting fears.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that he may have ease, he <MILESTONE N="3"> will not swagger his trouble away, nor drown it in the bottom of the cup, nor throw it away with his dice, nor play it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> carts, but desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth some grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> commonlie it is the least measure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Hereupon he desireth to hear such Sermons, and read such books as may best satisfie him concerning the least mea|sure of grace; for sin only troubling him, grace only can comfort him soundly: And so, <HI>Grace,</HI> which is meat and drink to an holy heart, is but Physick to this kind of men, to ease them of their fears and troubles.</P>
<P>Hereupon being ignorant of the height of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> grace, he fancieth to himself such

<P>When he hath attained unto this pitch of his own, now he thinketh himself a young beginner, and a good one too, so that if he dieth, he thinke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h he shal do well; if he liveth, he thinketh and hopeth he shal grow better: and when he is come to his own pitch, here he setteth down his state fully sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied.

Hence <HI>I</HI> have not much wondered at them, who maintain that a man may fall away from true grace. The reason lyeth here.

Hence also you shal have many professors hearing an hundred Sermons, never moved to grow better. Hence likewise you shal see our common Preachers comfort every one a most that they see troubled in mind, because they think presently they have true grace: Now they begin to be sorrowful for their sins. It is just according to their own light weights.</P>

<P>And that is seen principally in thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> five things, these five errors or false con|ceits.</P>
<P>First, in judging some trouble of mind, some light sorrow for sin, to be true re|pentance; and so thinking they do re|pent, hope they shall be saved: for sin is like sweet poison while a man is drin|king it down&punc; by commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting of it, there is much pleasure in it, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> after the com|mitting of it, there is a sting in it, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.31.32.

Nay, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they will fast, and humble, and afflict their souls voluntarily for sin, and now they think they have repented, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.3. And hereupon, when they hear that all that sin shal die, they grant this is true indeed, except a man repent, and so they think <HI>they have done already.</HI> This is true, <HI>At what time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a sinner repenteth, the Lord will bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out his iniquities.</HI> But this repentance is not when a man is troubled somewhat in mind for sin, but when he cometh to mourn for sin, as his greatest evil, as if he should see all his goods and estate on a light fire before him; and that not for some sins, but all sins little and great; and that not for a time, for a fit and away (a land-flood of sorrow) but always like a spring never dry, but ever running all a mans lifetime.</P>
<P>Secondly, in judging the striving of conscience against sin, to be the striving of the flesh against the spirit; and hence come these speeches from carnal black mouthes: <HI>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</HI> And hence men think, they being thus compounded of flesh and spi|rit, are regenerate, and in no worse estate then the children of God themselves&punc; as sometime I once spake with a man that did verily think, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was an honest

man, because he was so unwilling to cru|cifie Christ, which unwillingness did arise only from the restraint of conscience against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ct. So many men judge ho|nestly yet simply, upon such a ground of themselves; they say, they strive against their sins: but Lord be mercifull unto them, they say the <HI>flesh is fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l:</HI> and hence <HI>Armin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> giveth a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erse interpretation of the 7. <HI>cap.</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> from ordi|nary Divines; concerning which, <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh in the person of an unregenerate man because he observed divers gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">celess persons as (he saith himself) having fal|len, and falling commonly into sins against conscience, to bring that chapter in their own defence and comfort, because they did that which they allowed not, <HI>verse</HI> 15 and so it was not they, but <HI>sin</HI> that dwelled in them.</P>
<P>And so many amongst u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">know they should be better, and strive that they may grow better, but through the power of sin, cannot; conscience telleth them they must not sin, their hearts and lusts say they must sin; and here forsooth is flesh and spirit.

Such a war argueth not anie grace in the heart, but rather more strength of

Take heed therefore of judging your estate to be good&punc; because of some backwardness of your hearts to commit some sins, though little sins: for thy sins may be, and it is most cer|tain, are more powerfull in thee, then in others that have not the like struglings, because they have not such cheks as thou hast to restrain thee. Know therefore that the striving of the Spirit against the flesh, is against sin, <HI>because it is sin:</HI> as a man hateth a toad, thought he be never poisoned by it: But the striving of thy conscience against sin is only against sin, because it is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> troubling, or a damning sin. The striving of the Spirit against the flesh is from a deadly hatred of sin. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.15.

either in the being or power of it. Now sin in the being, ought not, must not, make a man question his estate, because the best have that left in them that will humble them, and make them live by faith; therefore the power of sin only can trouble a man.

good and safe, because he hath not only tasted, but bought this Christ, as the wise merchant in the Gospel, that rejoyced he had found the pearl, but yet stayeth not here, but selleth away all, and <HI>buyeth</HI> the pearl. Like two Chapmen that come to buy wine, the one tasteth it, and goeth away in a drunken fit, and so concludeth it is his: So a man doth that hath the false spirit: but the true spirited man doth not only taste, but buyeth the wine, although he doth not drink it all down, when he cometh to taste it: yet he having been in|cited by tasting to buy it&punc; <HI>now</HI> he calleth it his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: so a child of God tasting a little of God, and a little of Christ, and a little of the promises at his first conversion, al|though he tasteth not all the sweetness that is in God, yet he forsaketh all for God, for Christ, and so taketh them lawfully as his own.</P>
<P>Again, the false spirit having given a man comfort and peace, suffereth a man to rest in that estate; but the true Spirit ha|ving made the soul t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ste the love of the Lord, stirreth up the soul to do a work mightily for the Lord.

The other liveth upon his lusts and creatures, and yet catcheth hold on the promise.</P>
<P>By these four means is begot a bastard false peace.</P>
<P>Thus much of the second cause of mans deceiving himself; false peace in the <HI>con|science.</HI></P>
<P>Now followeth the third.</P>
<P N="3"><MILESTONE N="III"> III. The corruptions and distempers
<PB N="165" REF="000093_0144_0FA01670823E95C0">
of <HI>the will,</HI> which is the third cause why men deceive themselves, which are many, I will only name three.</P>
<P>First, when the <HI>will</HI> is resolved to go on in a sinful course, and then setteth the understanding a work to defend it: whence it fareth with the soul, as with a man that cometh to search for stollen goods, who having received a bribe afore-hand, sear|cheth every where but where it is, and so the man is never found out to be what he is: So a man having tasted the sweet|ness of a sinful course (which pleasure bribes him) he is contented to search into every corner of his heart, and to try him|self, as many do&punc; except <HI>ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> where his darling lust lyeth, <HI>he sitteth upon that,</HI> and covereth it willingly from his own eyes, as <HI>Rachel</HI> did upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ollen goods, and so ne|ver findeth out himself, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ohn</HI> 3.20. A man that hath a mind to sleep quietly, will cause the curtains to be drawn, and will let some light come in, but shutteth out all that, or so much as may hinder him from sleeping: So a man having a mind to sleep in some particular sinful course at his ease, will search himself, and let some light come into his mind.</P>
<P>And hence many prophane persons, that know much, their opinions are or|thodox, their discourse savory, yet do they know little of themselves, and of those
<PB N="166" REF="000093_0145_0FA01671423A8A98">
sins and lusts that haunt them, which they must part with, because this light troubleth them, it hindereth them from sleeping in their secure estate, and there|fore they draw the curtain here. Hence many men that live in those sins of the grossest usury, finding the gain, and ta|sting the sweet of that sin, will read all books, go to all those Ministers they suppose that hold it lawful, and so pick up and gather reasons to defend the law|fulness of the sin, and so because they would not have it to be a sin, find out reasons whereby they think it no sin: but the bottom is this, their will hath got the bribe, and now the understanding playeth the Lawyer; and hence men live in the most crying sins, and are sure to pe|rish, because they will not know they are in an error.</P>
<P>Secondly, when the will setteth the understanding a work to extenuate and lessen sin; for many when they see their sin, yet maketh it smal, by looking at the false end of their optick glass, they think such smal matters never make any breach between the Lord and their souls. Hence they say, <HI>The best man sinneth seven times a day:</HI> and <HI>who can say my, heart is clean?</HI> What is the reason that a child of God hath little peace many times after com|mission of smal sins? Oh! it is because
<PB N="167" REF="000093_0146_0FA0167209015028">
they see the horrible nature of the least sin, smal wrongs against so dear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The se|co~d rea|son why men ru|ine the~|selves.</NOTE> so great a friend as the Lord is, it cutteth their hearts; yet a carnal heart is never trou|bled for great sins, because they make a light matter of them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, wilful ignorance of the hor|rible wrath of God. Hence men rush on in sin, as the horse in the battle. Hence men never fear their estates, because they know not Gods wrath hanging over them. Coldest snakes when they are fro|zen with cold, never sting nor hurt, one may carry a nest of them in his bosom; but bring them to the fire, then they hiss and sting: so sin, when it is brought near Gods wrath (that devouring fire) it ma|keth men cry out of themselves, Then I am undone: Oh! I am a lost creature! But being not thus heated, sin never ma|keth a man cry out of himself.</P>
<P>These are the causes why men are ig|norant of their woful miserable e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tate, which <HI>ignorance</HI> is the first rock, or the first powder-plot that spoileth thousands.</P>
<P>Yet there are three more dangerous, because more secret.</P>
<P>Now followeth the second reason of mens ruine. By reason of mans <HI>carnal security,</HI> whereby men cannot be affe|cted with, not so much as have hearts to desire to come out of their misery, when
<PB N="168" REF="000093_0147_0FA01672C64EFD80">
they know it; for if a mans mind under|stand his misery, yet if the heart be hard or sleepy, and not affect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">den, woun|ded, humbled, and made to groan under it, he will never greatly ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to come out of it, <HI>Isai.</HI> 29.9.10. Now this is the estate of many a soul, he doth know his misery but by reason of the sleepy, secure, sensless spirit of slumber, he never feeleth it, nor mourneth under it, and so cometh out of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="reason"> Now the reasons of this securitie are these.</P>
<P>Because God poureth not out the full measure of his grace upon men, because he kindleth not the pile of wrath that lyeth upon men: it is reserved and concealed, <HI>not revealed from heaven,</HI> and so long, let God frown, Ministers threaten, and smal|ler judgements drop, yet they will never seek shelter in Jesus Christ, but sleep in their sins, until God rain down floods of horror, blood, fire; untill Gods arrows stick in mens hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 1.2.</NOTE> they will never seek out of themselves unto Jesus Christ, <HI>Ec|cles.</HI> 8.11. So long as Gods plagues were upon <HI>Pharao,</HI> he giveth fair words, and <HI>Moses</HI> must be sent to pray for him: but when Gods hand is taken away, now <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> hearts is hardened. So long as Gods sword is in his scabberd, men have such stout hearts, that they will never yeeld:
<PB N="169" REF="000093_0148_0FA0167387D2FDA0">
God must wound and cut deep, and stab, and thrust to the very heart, else men will never yeeld, never awaken, till Gods fists be about mens ears, and he is dragging them to the stake. Men will never awake and cry for a pardon and deliverance of their woful estate.<MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="reason"></P>
<P>Secondly, because if they do in part feel, and so fear Gods wrath, they put away the evil day far from them, they hope they shal do better hereafter, and re|pent some other time; and therefore they say, Soul eat, drink, follow thy sports, cups, queans: thou hast a treasure of time, which shal not be spent in many years, <HI>Isai.</HI> 22.12.13. That looketh as it is with the waxe, let it be of never so pliable a disposition, and the fire never so hot, yet if it be not brought near the fire, and be held in the fire, it never melteth, but still remaineth hard; so it is here. Let a man or woman have never so gentle or pliable a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ture, and let Gods wrath be never so hot and dreadful in their judgements, yet if they make not the day of what pre|fer to them, if they see it not ready every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment to light upon their hearts, they are never melted, but they remain hard hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, secure, sleepie wretches, and never groan to come out of their woful e|state&punc; and this is the reason why many men that have guilty consciences, though
<PB N="170" REF="000093_0149_0FA01674381B5F70">
they have many secret wishes, and purpo|seth to be better, yet never cry out of them|selves, nor never seek earnestly for mercy, till they ly upon their death-bed; &amp; then, oh, the promises that they ply God with! Try me, Lord, and restore me once more to my health, and life again, and thou shalt see how thankful I will be, because that now they apprehend wrath and miserie <MILESTONE UNIT="reason"> near unto them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, because they think they can bear Gods wrath, though they do con|ceive it near at hand, even at the very doors: men think not that hell is so hot, nor the devil so black, nor God so terrible as indeed he is. And hence we shall ob|serve the Prophets present Gods wrath as a thing intollerable before the eyes of the people, that thereby they might quench all those cursed conceits of being able to bear Gods wrath, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 1.6. And hence we shall have many men desperately con|clude, they will have their swinge in sin, and if they perish, they hope they shall be able to best it: <HI>It is but a damning,</HI> they think, and hence they go on securely. O poor wretches! the devil scares and fears all the world, and at Gods wrath the devils quake&punc; and yet secure men fear it not, they think hell is not so horrible a place:</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="reason"> Fourthly, because they know no better an estate Hence though they feel their
<PB N="171" REF="000093_0150_0FA01678183FCB50">
woful and miserable condition, yet they desire not to come out of it. Although men find hard lodging in the world, hard times, hard friends, hard hearts, yet they make a shift with what they find in this miserable Inne, untill they come to hell, for such a man pursued by outward mise|ries, or inward troubles there stayeth. O miserable man! that maketh shift till he come to hell. They may hear of the happie estate of Gods people, but not kno|wing of it experimentally, they stay where they are, <HI>John</HI> 4.14.</P>
<P>Take a Princes child, and bring it up in a base house or place, it never aspireth after a Kingdom or Crown: So men hatcht in this world, knowing no better an estate, never cast about them to get a better inheritance, then that they scram|ble for here&punc; Wives mourn for the long absence of their beloved husbands, be|cause they know them, and their worth.

it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Is there no more sweetness in the pre|sence of Gods smiling in Christ, then in a filthie whore?

So it is here, if men did but once taste of the happiness of Gods people, they would not for a thousand worlds be one half hour in their wilde loose sea again.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="reason"> Fifthly, because if they do know a bet|ter estate, yet their present pleasures, their sloath, doth so bewitch them, and Gods denyals when they seek un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, do so far discourage them, that they sleep still securely in that estate. A sloathfull heart bewitched with present ease, and plea|sures and delights considering many a tear, many a prayer must it make, many a night must it break its sleep, many a weary step must it take towards heaven and Christ, if ever he come there, groweth discouraged and deaded, and hard-hearted in a sleepy estate, and had rather have a bird in the hand, then two in the bush, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.32. <HI>Jer.</HI> 48.11.

land, difficulties to overcome. O sloth|fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l hearts! Secondly because God som|times put them to straits, and denyed them what they sought for, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey were of such a waspish, teastie sullen spirit, that because the Lord had them not alwayes on his knees, they would run away: So many a man meeteth with sorrow enough in his sinfull dropsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, drunken estate; he heareth of heaven and a better estate, yet why goeth he to his lusts and flesh-pots again?

<P>Sixthly, because of the strange strong <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="reason"> power of sin, which beareth that sway over mens souls, that they must serve it, as prisoners stoop to their Jailor, as soul|diers that have taken their pay, <HI>their plea|sure of sin,</HI> must follow it as their Cap|tain, though they go marching on to

<P>Eightly, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cause men nourish a blind&punc; false, flattering hope of Gods mercy: hence many knowing and suspecting that all is nought with them, yet having some

hope they may be in a good estate, and God may love them: hence they ly down securely, and rest in their flattering hope. Hence observe, those people that seldom come to a conclusion, to a point, that ei|ther they are in the state of grace or out of it, that never come to be affected, but remain secure in their condition, they commonly grow to this desperate conclu|sion, that they hope God w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll be merciful unto them; if not, they cannot help it: Like the man that had on his target the picture of God and the devil: under that first he writ, <HI>Si tu non vis, If thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not.</HI> Under the other he writ, <HI>Ipse rogitat. Here is one will.</HI></P>
<P>Ninthly, because men bring not their hearts under the hammer of Gods word to be broken: they never bring their con|sciences to be cut. Hence they go on still securely with festered consciences. Men put themselves above the word, and their hearts above the hammer: they come not to have the Minister to humble them, but to judge of him, or to pick some pretty fine thing out of the word, and so remain secure sots all their dayes: for if ever thy heart be broken, and thy con|science be awaked&punc; the word must do it: but people are so Sermon trodden, that their hearts, like foot-paths, grow hard by the word.</P>

They say, though they make no such showes, they know what good prayers they make in private: their hearrs, they say, are good. I tell you, brethren, he that trusteth to his own heart, and his good desires, and so resteth in them, is a fool.
