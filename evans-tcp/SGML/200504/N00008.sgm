<P>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the Synod of the Elders &amp; messengers of our churches assembled at Cambridg, the last of the sixth month, <HI>1648.</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch joyntly passed in these words; <HI>This Synod having per|used, &amp; considered (with much gladness of heart, &amp; thankfullness to God) the co~fession of faith published of late by the Reverend Assembly in England, doe judge it to be very holy, orthodox, &amp; judicious in all matters of faith: &amp; doe therfore freely &amp; fully consent therunto, for the substance therof. Only in those things which have respect to church government &amp; discipline, wee refer our selves to the platform of church-discipline, agreed upon by this present asse~bly: &amp; doe therfore think it meet, that this confession of faith, should be co~mend|ed to the churces of Christ amongst us, &amp; to the Honoured Court, as worthy of their due consideration &amp; acceptance.</HI> Howbeit, wee may not conceal, that the doctrine of vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation expressed in <HI>Chap 10. S 1.</HI> &amp; summarily repeated, <HI>Chap 13. &amp; 1.</HI> passed not without some debate. Yet considering, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the term of vocation, &amp; others by which it is described, are capable of a large, or more strict sense, &amp; use, and that it is not intended to bind apprehensions precisely in point of order or method&punc; there hath been a generall condescendency therunto.</P>
<P>Now by this our professed consent &amp; free concurrence w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th them in all the doctri|nalls of religion, wee hope, it may appear to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, that as wee are a remnant of the people of the same nation with them: so wee are professors of the same common faith, &amp; fellow-heyres of the same common salvation. Yea moreover, as this our pro|fession of the same faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgme~ts) from sus|picion of heresy: so (wee trust) it may exempt us in the like sort from suspicion of schism: that though wee are forced to dissent from them in matters of church-disci|pline: Yet our dissent is not taken up out of arrogancy of spirit in our selves (whom they see willingly condescend to learn of them:) neither is it carryed with uncharitab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e censoriousness towards them (both which are the proper, &amp; essentiall charracters of schism) but in meekness of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sdom, as wee walk along with them, &amp; follow them, as they follow Christ: so where wee conceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a different apprehention of the mind of Christ (as it falleth out in some few points touching church-order) wee still reserve due reverence to them (whom wee judge to be, through Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st, the glorious lights of both nations:) &amp; only crave leave (as in spirit wee are bound) to follow the Lamb withersoever he goeth, &amp; (after the Apostles example) as wee beleive, so wee speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

<P>Wee are not ignorant, that (besides these aspersions of Heresy &amp; Schism) other exceptions also are taken at our way of church government: but (as wee conceive) upon as little g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound.</P>

<P N="2"><HI>2 That wee provide no course for the gayning, &amp; calling in, of ignorant, &amp; erronious&punc; &amp; scandalous perso~s, whom wee refuse to receive into our church|es, &amp; so exclude from the wholsom remedy of church-discipline.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3 That in our way, wee sow seeds of division &amp; hindrance of edificatio~ in every family: whilst admitting into our churches only voluntaries, the husba~d will be of one church, the wife of another: the parents of one church, the chil|dren of another the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ster of one church, the servants of another.

<P>But for Answer, as to the first: For gathering churches out of churches, wee can|not say, that it is a thing unheard of in Scripture. The first christian church was gathered out of the Jewish church, &amp; out of many Synagogues in that church, &amp; consisted partly of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Inhabitants of Ierasalem, partly of the Galileans: who though they kept some communion in some parts of publick worship wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the Temple: yet neither did they frequent the Sacrifices, nor repair to the Sanedrim for the determin|ing of their church-causes: but kept entire &amp; constant communion with the Apostles church in all the ordinances of the gospell. And for the first ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">istian church of the Gentiles at Antoch, it appeareth to have been gathered &amp; constituted partly of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spersed brethren of the church at Ierusalem (wherof some were men of Cyprus, and Cyrene) &amp; partly of the beleiving Gentiles. <HI>Acts. 11.20, 21.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it be said the first christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an church at Ierusalem, &amp; that at Antioch were gathered not out of any christian church, but out of the Jewish Temple and
<PB N="4" REF="000025_0006_103CEF3C3ACB0298">
Synagogues, which were shortly after to be abolished: &amp; their gathering to Antioch, was upon occasion of dispersion in time of persecution.</HI></P>
<P>Wee desire, it may be considered, <HI>1</HI> That the members of the Jewish Church were more strongly and straitly tyed by express holy covenant, to keep fellowsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p with the Iewish church, till it was abolished, then any members of christian parish-churches are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to be tyed to keep fellowship with their par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh-churches. The Episcopall Canons, which bind them to attend on their parish church, it is likely they are now abolished with the Episcopacy. The common Law of the Land is satisfyed (as wee concive) if they attend upon the worship of God in any other church though not w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thin their own parish. But no such like covenant of God, nor any other religious tye lyeth upon them to attend the worship of God in their own par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh church, as did lye upon the Iewes to attend upon the worship of God in their Temple and Synagogues.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2</HI> Though the Iew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh Temple Church at Ierusalem was to be abolished, yet that doeth not make the desertion of it by the members, to be lawfull, till it was abol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh|ed. Future abolition is no warrant for present desertio~: unless it be lawfull in some case wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lest the chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is yet in present standing to desert it; to witt, either for avoyding of present polutions, or for hope of greater edification, and so for better satisfaction to conscience in either, future events (or foresight of them) is not disolve present relations. Else wives, children, servants, might desert their husbands, parents, masters, when they be mortally sick.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3</HI> What the members of the Iewish church did, in joyning to the church at Antioch, in time of persecution, it may well be concived, the members of any christian church may do the lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for satisfaction of conscience. Peace of conscience is more desirable, then the peace of the outward man: and freedome from scruples of conscie~ce is more comfortable to a sincere heart, then freedome from persecution.</P>
<P><HI>If it be said, these members of the Christian Church at Ierusalem, that joyn|ed to the church at Antioch, removed their habitations together with their re|lations: which if the brethren of the congregationall way would doe, it wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld much abate the grievance of their departure from their presbyteriall churches.</HI></P>
<P>Wee verily could w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh them so to doe, as well approving the like removall of ha|bitations, in case of changing church-relations (provided, that it may be done wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout too much detriment to their outward estates) and wee for our partes, have done the same. But to put a necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of removall of habitation in such a case, it is to foment and cherish a corrupt principle of making civil cohabitation, if not a formall cause, yet at least a proper adjunct of church-relation; which the truth of the Gospel doeth not acknowledg. Now to foment an errour to the prejudice of the trueth of the Gos|pell&punc; is not to walke w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th a right foot according to the truth of the Gospel, as Paul judgeth, <HI>Galat. 2.14.</HI></P>
