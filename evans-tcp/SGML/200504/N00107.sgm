<P>AS I have sometime said unto you, so I now write, That there be none on Earth that have so great and eminent a Calling from man to take care of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they be instructed in the wayes of life by Christ Jesus, as your selves have. For, besides the <HI>Right Honourable Corporation</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> His <HI>Majesty</HI> our Soveraign hath ordered a Trust to be committed to such as shall be in y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Order, namely, <HI>Commissioners of the United Co|lonies</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> to take care of this matter. I finde few English Students willing to engage in|to so dim a Work as this is. God hath in mercy raised up sundry among themselves to a competent ability to teach their Countrymen. Many have been sent forth by the Church this Winter to divers places, and not without good success, through the grace of Christ: of which I shall (if God will, and that I live) give you an account at your next

I finde it necessary for me to instruct them (as in Principles of Art, so) in the way of communicating the good knowledge of God, which I conceive is most familiarly done by way of <HI>Dia|logues;</HI> an Essay whereunto I do here present unto you: purposing, if the Lord will, and that I live, to do more of the like kinde hereafter. My earnest Request unto your selves, is, That in all your re|spective Colonies you would take care that due Ac|commodation of Lands and Waters may be allowed them, whereon Townships and Churches may be (in after-Ages) able to subsist; and suffer not the English to strip them of all their Lands, in places fit for the Sustenance of the life of man.

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Dialogues</HI> are partly <HI>Historical,</HI> of some things that were done and said; and partly <HI>Instructive,</HI> to show what might or should have been said, or that may be (by the Lords assistance.) here|after done and said, upon the like occasion.

<P>Let us go unto my house, that you may take there some refreshment of food after your weary journey, and there we shall have liberty to discourse fully of these matters. And while we are in the way, let me ask you of the estate and welfare of our friends and kindred at <HI>Natik</HI>; doth your praying to God exempt you from Sicknesses, Poverty, Nakedness? will praying to God fill you with food, gladness, and garments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our friends at <HI>Natik</HI> were when I left them in good state of health, peace and comfort: for which we give God thanks, who is the Father of all mercies.</P>
<P>Touching your question, Whether praying to God doth exempt us from Sicknesses, Poverty, and fills us with food and garments: I answer, If praying to God did bring with it outward plenty and worldly prosperity, then all carnal people would pray to God, not because they love God, or praying to God, but because they love themselves, and love food, clothing, and worldly pleasures; but the benefits of praying are spiritual and heavenly, it teaches us to know God, and the evil of sin; it teacheth us to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pent of sin, and seek for pardon, and it teacheth us to forsake sin for ever: and if we are loth to part with sin, God will chastise us with Sick|nesses, Poverty, and other worldly crosses, to call us to repentance, and therefore many times we fare worse in the world, then wicked men do, that thereby we might be weaned from the world, and brought and taught to love and long for heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. And yet I fur|ther tell you, that Religion doth teach the right way to be rich and prosperous in this world, and many, English especially&punc; have learn|ed that way. For Religion teacheth us to be diligent in labour six dayes, and on the seventh day to rest, and keep it an holy Sabbath; and God hath promised that <HI>the dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gent hand shall make rich:</HI> and when we walk with God in godline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and obedience, he will give us the blessing of this life, so far as is best for us, he will withhold no good thing from us; if any thing be withheld from us, or ta|ken away from us, it is because it is not good for us: Our Father better knoweth what is good for us, then we our selves know.</P>

<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your praying to God do indeed teach you the true way of being rich, as you say, how then cometh it to pass that you are so poor still? for you have prayed to God these twenty years and more, and I do not see that you have increased in riches very much, you are still poor: where be your Riches? where be your flocks and herds of Cattel? where be your Clothes? what great Houses have you built? where be your fields of Corn, Barns and Orchards? Alas, you are not like the English; and therefore I doubt upon this point, it is not as you say, that praying to God teacheth you the right way to be rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the least, the last, the lowest of those things that our Religion teacheth us. There be two sorts of riches; Earthly riches, of which onely you speak, and Heavenly riches, which Gods Word calleth true riches. These Earthly riches are but temporary, and shall soon perish, but the true riches are hea|venly, and eternal, they last for ever. And we have spent these twenty Years in seeking chiefly after heavenly riches, for so God commandeth us in his Word, <HI>Seek first the Kingdome of Heaven,</HI> as for these earthly riches <HI>they shall be added to you,</HI> so much as you need. And the Word of God commandeth us to <HI>be content if we have food and clothes</HI>; Now we have food and clothes more then we were wont to have before we prayed to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and we have con|tented our selves therewith, and have bent our mindes more to look after heavenly riches, and in those things we have increased more, then in earthly riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray tell me what are those heavenly riches of which you speak so highly, and upon which you do bestow your chief care and pains, and so much prefer before earthly riches, which we ac|count so much of, and think to be the best things attainable in this world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>The true riches which we spend our time to seek after, are, 1. The knowledge of the great God, who hath made this vast World, and governeth the same by his Wisdome and Power, and who hath made Man, and governeth us by his holy Laws and Commandments.</P>
<P N="2">2. The knowledge of our selves, to be miserable sinners, and do daily offend and sin against God, provoking his wrath against us, to punish us for our transgressions against his holy Laws and Com|mandments.</P>
<P N="3">3. The knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, who hath in unspeakable love took a course to deliver us from the wrath of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d: for whereas we have by our sins deserved Death &amp; Damnation, Christ became a Man, and died for us, and thereby hath pacified the Justice and Wrath of God, and opened a way of Salvation for us, obtaining a Pardon for us&punc; and offering grace unto us, whereby we may be saved, and be brought to eternal glory and happiness.</P>
<P N="4">

<PB N="5" REF="000161_0008_0FA2B46911B32890">4. The knowledge of the grace of God in Jesus Christ, whereby he bringeth us to repent of our sins, to convert and turn from all our evil wayes, and to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to walk with God in the wayes of holiness and righteousness before him.</P>
<P N="5">5. The knowledge of the Means of grace, the Ordinances of God; whereby we walk with God in wayes of Civil Government, in wayes of Justice, and good Order. And in the Ordinances of Worshipping God, in the sanctifying of the Sabbaths, and walking in the Communion of Saints, by the Word of God, and Prayer, and Singing of Psalms.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the knowledge of the estate of all men after death; how the godly men that penitently believe in Christ, go to Heaven when they die; and the wicked, that refuse to repent and believe, they go to Hell, and there abide till the Day of Judgement: at which day or time, when it cometh, all men shall rise again and be judged according to their deeds in this life; and then shall the godly go with Christ to eternal Glory, and the wicked shall be cast into Hell Soul and Body, and there be tormented with the Devils for ever.</P>

<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are great and strange things you speak of, I un|derstand them not, but yet me&punc; thinks there is a majesty and glory in them. I am amazed at what you say, though I do not under|stand them distinctly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then that we are grown rich with Riches that are above your capacity; and these are the <HI>true Riches,</HI> and about these things we spend most of our time. And as for these world|ly Riches, we less regard them, as being poor, low, little, small, contemptible things, in comparison of those heavenly riches about which we spend our time; and in which we have increased and gained, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> grace in Christ, so much as doth make you admire at us, though we know but little of what is to be known, but you ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ot perceive the glory and excellency thereof.</P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d indeed it is the wisdome and love of God unto us, that sett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> rather to grow in these riches, which the eyes of world|ly men cannot see, then to grow rich in earthly and worldly riches, which the carnal world can see: because if we should abound in earthly riches, we should be thronged with multitudes of carnal persons, who love the world, and love not God, who would be a cumber and temptation to us. And it is a sign that our wayes are good and godly, and above the world, because so few (in compa|rison) come unto us, but rather fly from us; because they love to live in wayes and deeds of darkness, and hate the light and glory that is in our wayes.

<SPEAKER>Kinswoman.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an addition to the joyes of this day, to see the face of my loving Kinsman: and I wish you had come a little ear|lier, that you might have taken part with us in the joyes of this day, wherein we have had all the delights that could be desired, in our merry Meeting, and Dancing.</P>
<P>And I pray Cousin how doth your Wife, my loving Kinswoman, is she yet living? and is she not yet weary of your new way of praying to God? And what pleasure have you in those wayes?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife doth remember her love to you, she is in good health of body, and her Soul is in a good condition, she is entred into the light of the knowledge of God, and of Christ; she is en|tred into the narrow way of heavenly joyes, and she doth greatly desire that you would turn from these wayes of darkness in which you so much delight, and come taste and see how good the Lord is.</P>
<P>And whereas you wish I had come sooner, to have shared with you in your delights of this day; Alas, they are no delights, but griefs to me, to see that you do still delight in them. I am like a man that have tasted of sweet Wine and Honey, which have so al|tered the taste of my mouth, that I abhor to taste of your sinful and foolish pleasures, as the mouth doth abhor to taste the most filthy and stinking dung, the most sowre grapes, or most bitter gall. Our joyes in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, which we are taught in the Book of God, and feel in our heart, is sweeter to our soul, then honey is unto the mouth and taste.</P>

<P>We have all the delights that the flesh and blood of man can devise and delight in, and we taste and feel the delights of them, and would you make us believe that you have found out new joyes and delights, in comparison of which all our delights do stink like dung; would you make us believe that we have neither eyes to see, nor ears to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, nor mouthes to taste? <HI>Ha, ha he!</HI> I appeal to the sense and sight and feeling of the Compa|ny present, whether this be so.</P>

<P>Hearken to me, my friends, and see if I do not give a clear answer unto this seeming difficulty. Your dogs take as much delight in these Meetings, and the same kindes of delight as you


<PB N="7" REF="000161_0010_0FA2B46A7B0004E8">
do; they delight in each others company; they provoke each o|ther to lust, and enjoy the pleasures of lust as you do; they eat and play and sleep as you do: what joyes have you more then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs have? to delight the body of flesh and blood.</P>
<P>But all mankinde have an higher and better part then the body, we have a Soul, and that Soul shall never die: Our Soul is to converse with God, and to converse in such things as do concern God, and Heaven, and an eternal estate, either in happiness with God, if we walk with him and serve him in this life, or in misery and torment with the Devil, if we serve him in this life. The service of God doth con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">st in Virtue, and Wisdome, and delights of the Soul, which will reach to Heaven, and abide for ever.</P>
<P>But the service of the Devil is in committing sins of the flesh, which defile both body and soul, and reach to Hell, and will turn all to fire and flame to torment your souls and bodies to all eter|nity.</P>
<P>Now consider, all your pleasures and delights are such as defile you with sin, and will turn to flame, to burn and torment you; they provoke God to wrath, who hath created the Prison of Hell to torment you, and the more you have took pleasure in sin, the greater are your offences against God, and the greater shall be your torments.</P>
<P>But we that pray to God repent of our old sins, and by faith in Christ we seek for, and finde a pardon of what is past, and grace and strength to reform for time to come. So that our joyes are Soul-joyes in godliness, and virtue, and hope of glory in another world when we die.</P>
<P>Your joyes are bodily&punc; fleshly, such as Dogs have, and will all turn to flames in Hell to torment you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>If these things be so, we had need cease laughing, and fall to weeping, and see if we can draw water from our mournful eyes to quench these tormenting flames. My heart trembles to hear these things: I never heard so much before, nor have I any thing to say to the contrary, but that these things may be so. But how shall I know that you say true? Our fore fathers were (many of them) wise men, and we have wise men now living, they all de|light in these our Delights: they have taught us nothing about our Soul, and God, and Heaven, and Hell, and Joy and Torment in the life to come. Are you wiser th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n our fathers? May not we rather think that <HI>English</HI> men have invented these Stories to amaze and scare us out of our old Customes, and bring us to stand in awe of them, that they might wipe us of our Lands, and drive us into Corners, to seek new wayes of living, and new places too? and be beholding to them for that which is our own, and was ours, before we kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w them.</P>

Yet this is also true, that we have great cause to be thankful to the English, and to thank God for them, for they had a good Country of their own, but by Ships sailing into these parts of the World, they heard of us, and of our Country, and of our nakedness, ignorance of God, and wilde condition; God put it into their hearts to desire to come hither, and teach us the good knowledge of God; and their King gave them leave so to do, and in our Country to have their liber|ty to serve God according to the Word of God. And being come hither, we gave them leave freely to live among us: they have pur|chased of us a great part of those Lands which they possess; they love us, they do us right, and no wrong willingly; if any do us wrong, it is without the consent of their Rulers, and upon our Complaints our wrongs are righted. They are (many of them, especially the Ruling part) good men, and desire to do us good. God put it into the heart of one of their Ministers (as you all know) to teach us the knowledge of God, by the Word of God, and he hath Translated the holy Book of God into our Language, so that we can perfectly know the minde and counsel of God: and out of this Book have I learned all that I say unto you, and there|fore you need no more doubt of the truth of it, then you have cause to doubt that the Heaven is over our head, the Sun shineth, the Earth is under our feet, we walk and live upon it, and breathe in the Air; for as we see with our eyes these things to be so, so we reade with our own eyes these things which I speak of, to be writ|ten in Gods own Book, and we feel the truth thereof in our own hearts.</P>

<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an ill time for you to come to perswade us to pray to God, when praying to God is so opposed, hated and hindred; you may be more like to prevail with us, when praying to God is of credit, honour, and good esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium</SPEAKER>
<P>Such as will turn to God onely at such times when pray|ing is in credit, leave themselves under a doubt, whether it be for the love of God and his wayes, that they pray, or for love of them|selves and their own credit.</P>
<P>But when men will take up praying to God in evil times, when they must expect hard measure from the world for it, this is a sign that they love God, and love praying to God, better then they love themselves, and that they deny themselves for Christ his sake. Therefore I have taken the fittest time to try you, and to sift you, to catch none but the good Corn, and to let go and lose all the dust and chaff.</P>

<P>Some speak of very many English people killed with Thunder, and many burnt in their houses: is it so indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so indeed, and in many parts of the Country, at <HI>Boston,</HI> and in many other places. Very lately, there were in one Winter eight or nine persons burnt to death in one house, five in another, one in another. Sicknesses are often sent of God among them, which kill many: Their Corn is Blasted, and they are pu|nished by God many wayes, by Sea and Land, in these late years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinswom.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are but cold and weak Arguments to perswade us to take up the English fashion, and to serve their God, when you tell us how sharply he dealeth with his Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right: we are better as we are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>We know there be many sins among the English, which provoke God to be angry with them, and to punish them, to the end he might bring them to repentance. When we exhort you to pray, and to serve the God of the English, we call you to imitate the virtues and good wayes of the English, wherein you shall be acceptable to the Lord: We do not call you to imitate their sins, whereby they and you shall provoke the anger and displeasure of the Lord. And what though God doth chastise his people for their sins? it is his wisdome, faithfulness and love so to do: a Child will not run away from his wise and loving Father, because he cha|stises him for his faults, but will love him the better, fear him the more, and learn thereby to be a good Childe. The wise English love God the more, for his wise Chastisement of them for their sins. And why may not I use it as an Argument to perswade you to choose him to be your God, who will love and encourage you in all virtue, and love and punish you for all sins, that he might bring you to repentance and amendment of life. Gods Rods have more encouragement to a wise heart, then discouragement in them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceived the Thunder to be more this way, then it was in the place where I was at that time travelling. Touching the fear of Thunder, the Word of God saith it is terrible, and the bruit Beasts tremble at it: it is sometime called <HI>The Voice of God,</HI> by reason of the terribleness of it; and the reason of its terrour to man is, because we are great sinners, and have deserved Gods wrath, and it should move our hearts to repentance for our sins, and take heed of provoking the anger of that God, who is able to utter so terrible a voice, and can dash down destroying fire upon us worms, who are no wayes able to defend our selves.</P>

<P>I pray tell me why you are so careful to pray unto God before and after meat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us first give Thanks, and then we will discourse that point. Attend all. <HI>We do give humble thanks unto thy holy Name, O Lord our God, for our life, health, food, raiment; and for this pre|sent food whereby we are refreshed. We thank thee, O Lord, for the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve we finde among our friends, and for our freedome in good dis|course for the good of our Souls: We do pray for a blessing upon both, that our food may strengthen our Bodies, and our discourse may do good to our Souls. Help me so to declare thy Word and thy Works, that I may win their Souls to love thee, and to forsake their sins, and turn unto the Lord by true Repentance. These, and all other mercies we pray for, in the Name, and for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Amen. <HI>All</HI> Tabat, tabat, tabat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now my Kinsmen and Friends let us discourse a little about the Question propounded, <HI>Why we pray unto God before and after Meat?</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ did so before meat, as it is written of him in many examples; and we are not to doubt but he did the same after meat, because the Lord hath commanded the same so expresly, saying, <HI>When thou hast eaten and art full, then be|ware lest thou forget the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And to shew you what great reason we have thus to do, consider that God doth some of his chief works in this world, in the matter of our eating, which no creature can do: for take you a Tray of meat, and ask, Who can turn this into blood, and flesh, and sinews, and bones, and skin? and who can give every part of our bo|dy its due proportion, that one part shall not overgrow the other, but every part alike? Who but God can do this? And


<PB N="12" REF="000161_0015_0FA2B47134D93490">
who but God can make our bodies to grow to such an appointed stature, and then to grow no more? And who but God can pre|serve our health, and turn away sicknesses? Now these marvellous things God doth for us every day, and every time we eat, and therefore is it not very good reason that we should pray and give thanks to God at such time as he doth such great and obliging things for us?</P>
<P>Again, God provideth all our food for us; he provideth Corn, not we our selves, we do but a little towards it, the great work is Gods: all that we do is to put our Corn into the ground, and k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ep the ground clean about it, but God makes it to grow, he gives it a root, a blade, a stalk, and ears, whereby one Corn shall become three or four or five hundred. Who but God can do this? there|fore Corn is of his providing.</P>
<P>Again, who provideth water, and watereth the Corn? is it not God? for when Springs and Rivers are dried up, what can men do, but cry to God? and then God will bring Clouds, like great Bottles full of water, and drop them down upon the withered and parched Earth, and thereby make the Corn and Grass, and all fruits to grow. Who but God can do this?</P>
<P>Again, God provides Flesh for us to feed upon, for he maketh the grass and herbs to grow, and when the beasts do feed thereon, he doth turn those Leaves into blood, flesh, sinews and bones; and this he giveth us for food, and turneth it into blood, flesh, sinews and bones in us. All these wonderful works God doth, in the matter of feeding us; and therefore is it not good reason we should then pray to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard so much before, nor thought of these things; but now you declare and teach them, my heart saith, that all is true which you say, and I now see great reason for this pra|ctise of you that pray to God, to pray and give thanks both before and after meat: and I see not but that there is good and just rea|son so to do, every time we drink, and take in any sustenance, at least to lift up our hearts to God, who hath so eminent an hand in doing us good thereby, or hurt if he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your acceptance and approbation of what I say, and of what we do in this point, is a great argument that God doth bow your heart to pray unto God; for you acknowledge it to be our duty so to do, and the neglect of it would be against the light of your own Reason: so that this Conviction hath cast a chain upon your soul, to binde you to pray unto God. What say you my friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We cannot say any thing against what you say, but what we shall do, we cannot yet tell: we must first consider of it, for we are ignorant and foolish, we cannot do as you do.</P>

<P>Bend your hearts to it, and God will teach you by his


<PB N="13" REF="000161_0016_0FA2B47142BF9530">
Word: for we were at first as ignorant as you are, but God helped us to hear the Word, and do what we could, and you see what God hath brought the matter unto. We now walk in the light, and now we call you to come into the light: therefore I say, <HI>Awake you that sleep, stand up from the dead, and Christ will give you light.</HI></P>

<P>We shall tire you with these discourses after your long and weary journey; it is time for you to go to rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>This discourse is better to me then meat, drink and sleep, if I may do good to your Souls, and turn you unto God.</P>
<P>But before we go to rest and sleep we must pray unto God, for it is God that giveth rest and sleep unto his Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do all you praying <HI>Indians</HI> thus do when you are weary and tired with labour, or travel, or hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do you pray be|fore you go to rest? what is the reason of your so doing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium.</SPEAKER>
<P>We alwayes do so: and if any should at any time through sloth and sleepiness fail so to do, we judge our selves for our sin, &amp; repent, and confess our sin unto God, and beg pardon and mercy for Christ his sake.</P>
<P>And there is great reason thus to pray unto God before we go to rest; for be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">des what I said that God giveth us rest, and therefore it is fit humbly to ask it of him; There be many other Reasons why we should thus do: for</P>
<P N="1">1. VVe must give God thanks for all the mercies we have re|ceived all the day, which are more then the moments of the time that we live.</P>
<P N="2">2. VVe must pray for Gods protection of us when we are asleep, we lye like so many dead men, and how easily might mischief be|fall us, either by Fire, or by an Enemy, if God did not defend and keep us; but when God is our keeper we may rest quietly, in safe|ty without fear, under the covert of his hand: and by faith in Gods protection we sleep quietly without fear, whereas you that do not pray, nor believe, nor commit your selves to God, you do alwayes sleep in fear and terrour.</P>
<P N="3">3. Moreover, our sleep and rest is a great reparation of our strength and spirits, and preservation of our health. VVhile we sleep our food is boiled up within us, and digested into all parts of our body, and new spirits are extracted out of our food, and sent up both to our head, heart, and all parts of our body, so that we are fresh and strong in the morning after a good nights rest. Now all this is the special work of God, beyond the power and skill of man to perform for us, and therefore it is great reason to pray for this blessing when we go to rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kinsm.</SPEAKER>
<P>VVhat you say is plain, clear and true in every bodies ex|perience, though I did never hear nor consider so much of it be|fore: if therefore you will pray we will attend you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pium</SPEAKER>
<P>These are two great Points which you have propounded. I am willing to speak to both. First, for the numbers that pray to God: At first this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter of praying to God was a little thing, like a Cloud in the VVest of the bigness of a mans hand, but now the Cloud is great and wide, and spreadeth over all the Country. <HI>Nop</HI> and <HI>Nantuket,</HI> and <HI>Paumenuk</HI> Islands, <HI>Mahshepog,</HI> and many parts of the main Land, to the utmost bounds of this Country Eastward. And VVestward, not onely all the <HI>Massachusets</HI> pray, but also a great part of <HI>Nipmuk</HI>; yea and <HI>the fields are ripe unto the harvest</HI> in many places more, whom I will not name until they have given up themselves to the Lord, to forsake their vanities, and to pray unto God. The Church of Christ at <HI>Natik</HI> have sent forth many into many parts of the Country, to call them in unto Jesus Christ. I am sent unto you, and I have good hope that God will bow your hearts to pray unto God. So that the <HI>praying Indians</HI> are many, and like to be more every year: And our hope is the greater, be|cause the Lord hath raised up sundry of our young men (who were children when we first prayed unto God) unto good know|ledge in the Scriptures, and are able to teach others the good knowledge of God, and are fit to be sent forth unto all parts of the Country, to teach them to pray unto God.</P>

<P>I thank you for your care of me. There is but one thing more that I am to speak to, <HI>viz.</HI> the second part of your question, <HI>What we have gained and got by praying to God?</HI> Of which Point we discoursed before we came into the house, and therefore I shall but touch it now.</P>
<P N="1">1 We are come into the light, and it is an heavenly light, which leadeth us to God, and to the eternal enjoyment of happiness by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. VVe have attained to some measure of the true Riches, by faith in Jesus Christ, and love to God and his people.</P>
<P N="3">3. VVe are content with that portion of food and raiment which God giveth us.</P>

<P>It is true that you say, and therefore we pray unto God to give us food, and to bless it to us when we eat it.</P>
<P>This discourse bringeth to my mind a word which Christ spake, <HI>Man liveth not by bread onely&punc; but by every word of God</HI> Man hath two parts, A Soul, and a Body, and both are to be fed. The body is fed by food, the Soul is fed by the Word of God and Prayer. You that pray not to God, you feed your bodies onely, but you starve your Souls: we that pray to God feed our Souls as well as our bodies. And this is one reason why we perswade you to pray to God, because we would not have you to star<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your Souls. The Soul is the most excellent part of man, and shall never die; the body shall die. If you have so much wisdome as to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d your bodies we pray you be yet more wise, and feed your Souls also.</P>

<P>Your Souls feed upon nothing but lust, and lying, and stealing, and killing, and Sabbath-breaking, and Pauwauing; and all these are sins which poison, starve, and kill your Souls, and expose them to Gods wrath that they may be tormented among De|vils and wicked men in Hell fire for ever: and therefore it is in love to your Souls that we perswade you to pray unto God. But now that we have eaten and are sufficed with food let us give Thanks to God for it, and pray that it may be blessed to us. [<HI>He giveth Thanks</HI>]</P>

Tear our hair from our heads, our skin from our flesh, our flesh from our bones, you shall as soon perswade us to suffer you to do so by us, as to perswade us to part with our old delights and courses. You tell us of the English-man's God, and of his Laws: We have Gods also, and more then they; and we have Laws also by which our forefathers did walk, and why should not we do as they have done? To change our Gods, and Laws, and Customs, are great things, and not easily to be obtained and ac|complished.

<P>You have spoken many things, which do minister matter to me of much discourse, both concerning God, and our selves, and concerning you, &amp; the offer of Gods mercy to you at this time. You say you have many Gods, but they are no Gods. There is but one God, the great Creator of this great World. Did your Gods make this World? the Heavens, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Clouds, the Seas, and the whole Earth? No, no; God made this whole world. Can any of your gods give Rain, or rule the Clouds? it is the Devil that blindeth your eyes, and covereth you with darkness. We teach you to know the true God, who can kill us, or keep us alive at his pleasure. Your gods shall all p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rish with you, for they are no gods.</P>
<P>As for your pleasures and delights, they are all sins against God, which provoke his wrath to plague you for ever. VVe now call you to repent of your evil wayes, and to reform your lives to serve the true and living God, to seek for pardon of your sins, and mer|cy to appease his wrath which is kindled against you. I do now offer you mercy through Jesus Christ; do not harden your hearts against the Lord: be therefore perswaded now to forsake your sins and turn unto the Lord, come unto the light out of your darkness,

<P>I feel my heart broken and divided, I know not what to do. To part with our former lusts and pleasures is an hard point, and I feel my heart very loth and backward to it, many objections against it: yet I cannot but confess, that I do not in my inward heart approve of them. I know they are vile and filthy, and I desire to forsake them, they are like burning coals in my bosome, I will shake them out if I can. I am ashamed of my old wayes, and loth I am to keep that which I am ashamed to be seen in. The wi|ser men be, the more they abstain from such lusts, and we account such to be foolish, vile and wicked, that are unbridled and un|persw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">deable. I would not be my self of the number of them that are vicious and vile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bove restraint.

In that point I would easily be perswaded, or at least I desire so to be: But the greatest difficulty that I yet fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de, is this; I a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> loth to divide my self from my Friends and Kindred If I should cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge my course and not they, then I must leave and forsake their company, which I am very loth to do.

matters, for the good of our Souls. We are all here this day be|fore the Lord: And first of all he hath commanded us to pray to|gether; therefore let us all either stand up like servants, or kneel down like sons and daughters, and pray unto the Lord. <HI>Them he prayeth</HI>&mdash; The next work we use to do, is to Catechize, that is, to teach by asking of Questions, and they that are taught make Answer according as they have been taught: but that work you are not yet fitted and prepared for, therefore we lay it by.

<P>And now I will teach you out of the Word of God. The Text is <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.13, 14. <HI>Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.

<P>In these words are two parts. 1. Here be two sorts of wayes wherein men walk. 2. Here be two sorts of men that walk in these two wayes. The first way is described by four things.

<P>The second way is described by four things.

<ITEM>1. The gate of entrance is <HI>broad</HI> and <HI>wide.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The way it self is pleasant, easie, full of delights of the flesh, and of worldly pleasures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is the end of this way, it leads to Hell, to torments, and to eternal damnation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Here be the Numbers that walk in this way, <HI>Very many</HI>; most men in the world will choose to walk in this way, and at last go to Hell torments.</ITEM>

<P>The third part of this Text is, how Jesus Christ is enabled to do these great things for us. This signified by his second Name, <HI>God with us.</HI></P>

I acknowledge wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t you say: but I pray what is that wherein you desire we might agreed for I do not under|stand that you have yet named that, and I the more desire to know that, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cause you do seem to put more weight upon that, then up|on all the rest which you have named.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You judge ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht touching my opinion of that thing which I have not mentioned, but I doubt that you will not be of my minde if I should speak it, and for that reason I did conceal it. Wise men will cover and hide their Jewels&punc; and not expose them to every bodies sight for they know some will lightly esteem them, because they know not their worth: but if they fall in company with such as know the worth of their Jewel, they will be content to let them see it, and take a full view of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth the more inflame my desire to know what this matter is that is so precious in your eyes&punc; and so doubt|ful to finde esteem with me. I confess I am foolish, but I hope you shall finde me one that would be wise, and love the company of the wise, and willing to learn of others that wisdome which I want; and therefore though I de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire not to know other mens se|crets, yet if this other matter you intimate be such as I may know, my desire is raised high to know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words are good and wise, and give me hopes that what I have further to say unto you, will find<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> acceptance with you according to my desire. I will therefore open to you the truth of the matter. I am a <HI>praying Indian,</HI> I have left our old <HI>Indian</HI> Customs, Laws, Fashions, Lusts, Pauwauings, and whatever else is contrary to the right knowledge of the true God, and of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. It repenteth me of all my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">-past life, the lusts, vanities, pleasures, and carnal delig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts that were formerly very sweet and delightful to me, are now bitter as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll unto me, I hate and loath them. All the works of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rkness in which I was wont to take pleasure, I do now forsake and abandon. I am come into the light, I now see things as they are indeed&punc; and nor as they seemed to be in the dark. I now know the VVord of God which sheweth me the way of eternal Life. I now know God who made all the world, against whom mankinde are turned re|bels and sinners. I know the Law of God which I have broken, and by my sins I have deserved eternal damnation in the world that is to come. I now know Jesus Christ, who hath died for us, to


<PB N="26" REF="000161_0029_0FA2B481131D4B98">
procure a pardon for us, and to open a door and way to eternal life and salvation for us. Into this way I have entred, herein I walk, and I have promised to God, that I will live and walk in this way all the dayes of my life.</P>
<P>And not onely so, but my desire is to perswade all others into the same way which I have entred, because I do certainly and ex|perimentally know that my former wayes were darkness, sin, and led unto hell and damnation; and this way whereinto I am now entred, is a way of light, life, holiness, peace, and eternal salva|tion: therefore do I earnestly perswade all that I meet with to be wise, and turn from the wayes of darkness, and come into this way of light and glory. And this is the thing which I did mean, when I said, <HI>that there is another thing wherein I wish that we may be alike.</HI> I do therefore exhort and intreat you that you would do as I have done, forsake your old wayes of sin, of which you have cause to be ashamed, and turn unto God, call on God, be numbred among the <HI>praying Indians.</HI></P>

<P>Oh I am surprized, I am amazed, you have ravished my Soul, you have brought a light into my Soul. I wonder at my self: where have I been? what have I done? I am like one raised out of a dark pit; you have brought me forth into the Sunshine. I begin to see about me: if I look back, and down into the pit where I have been all my dayes, I wonder at my self what a dead dark thing I have been; when I look upon you, I see you like an Angel of light. I have heard of this business of praying to God, some have spoken ill of it, some have spoken favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly I could not tell what it was, but now by your discourse I begin to see what an excellent thing it is: it changes men, and advances them into a condition above other men. You have dealt with me like as the Fishers do by the fish, you laid a Bait for me to make me de|sire it, and bite at it, but I saw not your hook, until you had catch'd my Soul; and now I am catch'd, I see it was not for my hurt, but for my great good. The light which I do already see is a beautiful and desireable thing, and therefore I pray you go on, and tell me more of this new way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>The two first things you are to consider of now you are come into the light, and your heart willing to attend unto this great work of praying to God, are these:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To know God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Our selves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Of God, know his Greatness, Goodness, VVisdome, and Power. He hath made all things in this great world; all things above us are his works, he made the Heavens, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Clouds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all things below, the Seas, the Earth, and all things that are in them: he made Man, and gave him dominion over all his works in this world, and a Law of Life, under the penalty of


<PB N="27" REF="000161_0030_0FA2B481CC208DA0">
damnation: and all this God did in six days; so great is God above man. The Law which he gave to man is holy, just and good: but man by the temptation of evil Angels, who by their sin became to be Devils, I say man broke the Law which God gave him, and sin|ned against God, turned Rebel against God, and served the Devil: and in this rebellion all the children of men go on to this day.</P>
<P>Gods Law is in Ten Commandments, wherein he requireth of man to know and worship God, fear his Name, and keep his Sab|baths; and other Laws forbid Lust, Murther, Stealing, and all other evils. Moreover, God hath annexed unto his Law a great Promise, <HI>Do and live,</HI> with a just Punishment, <HI>Sin and die</HI> eternally; namely, that all the breakers of this Law, and sinners against him, shall be punished in hell fire with eternal torments. And this is the condition of all mankinde, and it is our estate, that by our sins against God we have deserved to die, and then to be cast away down into hell fire, to be tormented among the Devils, who tempt|ed us to sin, and whom we have served in our life time: now toge|ther with them we must be tormented for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh you have now killed me again: By the first light you shewed me, I thought you had made me alive, and I joyed in the light, but I understood it not. Now your light is become a sword, it hath pierced through my heart, by it I now see I am a dead man. Alas, I have been a sinner all my dayes, I am guilty of more sins then I have lived dayes, many sins in a day have I committed: Night and day have I offended God, and broke his Law. I have served the Devil and not God, I have done nothing that God com|mandeth, I have only served the Devil, and committed sin; there|fore I have deserved to be damned in hell, and to be tormented among the Devils for ever, whom in this life I have served with so much delight; And now poor miserable I, what shall I do? These Trees under whose shade we sit, why fall they not upon me and crush this rebellious worm in pieces, and send me away to the place of eternal torment? These Rocks and hills about us, why fall they not upon me and break me into dust and powder, and send me away unto perdition? will God regard these complaints of mine? what are these tears of mine? can they quench hell fire? nay, will they not rather be oyle unto those flames? I am in mi|sery, help I can finde none; the greatness of Gods Majesty and power, against whom I a finite poor worm have sinned, doth most amaze me. I pray help me further to understand the great majesty of God.</P>

<P>For this purpose this young man with us shall reade unto you some part of the VVord of God. Reade the 40 Chapter of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> begin at the 12 verse, and reade unto the 27. <HI>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand? and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in measure, and

<P>I am in the same condition with you, and so are we all: but I have rest and quiet in my Soul, because I have found a ran|some, with which God is well pleased, his wrath is pacified, and I am delivered; I have escaped the danger of those deserved flames.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your speeches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re some stay to my distressed Soul, it breed|eth some hope in me to hear that there is a ransome to be found, and that you have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">und it; may there be hope that I also may finde the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, there is hope in Israel touching this matter; it is as free for you as me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh that you would shew me this Remedy. You have shew|ed me my mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry and danger, effectually; may it please the Lord to make you as successful to shew me the Remedy. But my Soul is still drowned in doubt and fear: Oh how I long to hear where this Remedy is to be found. I would go to the worlds end to finde it, I would take any pains to obtain it; but my trembling heart saith you and <HI>I</HI> both may be deceived, for what Creature in all the world is able to deliver a Soul from the hand of this Omni|po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent and All-seeing God, whose Justice and Law are Unchange|able, and nothing save blood and death can satisfie it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, no Creature is able to deliver us, vain is the help of Man or Angel in this case. As you said before, your mournings, cries and tears cannot do it, none but God himself can do it; and


<PB N="29" REF="000161_0032_0FA2B48337C1BE20">
your heart will say and yield that God himself can do it: <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.9. <HI>As heaven is above earth, so are Gods thoughts above ours.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, that I can freely yield unto, that God himself can do it; what cannot he do? but will the offended just and holy God pacifie himself for my offences, and pardon so great a sinner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s I? God is just and holy, and how can it stand with his holy Justice to pardon a vile sinner, without satisfaction to his holy Justice? will the holy God cease to be just? will he abrogate and disanul his holy Law, which I have so often, so deeply, so rebelliously broken? I have some hope, because you say it is so, but I see not yet how it can be, for God is Unchangeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true that you say, God will never deny his own Ju|stice, nor abrogate his holy Law for our sakes: But our God is a merciful God, and infinite in wisdome, and by his infinite wisdome he hath found out a way to satisfie the Justice of his own Law, and to deliver poor sinners from the condemnation of the Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can that be? Can man, or any Creature for him, satisfie the Justice of the Law of God? Oh I am in the dark about this matter, you speak of impossibilities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing that is holy just and good is impossible with God; and therefore to shew you God hath done this, know, that God hath done it himself, and whatever God hath done is holy just and good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray tell me how this can be: Oh how I long to hear of this way of deliverance of a poor sinner out of the hands of Gods holy Justice and unchangeable Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will (as well as I can) declare it unto you. God is One in Three; <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost:</HI> which we must believe and admire, though we cannot demonstrate. I shall at this time say no further of that point, onely thus much; God one in Es|sence, in his infinite Wisdome and Understanding, conceiveth the Image of himself as the onely adequate object of his infinite wis|dome. God <HI>conceiving</HI> is the Father: God <HI>conceived</HI> is the Son; this intellectual act of <HI>conceiving,</HI> is called Begetting: God <HI>con|ceiving,</HI> and God <HI>conceived,</HI> by an infinite act of volition, loveth himself; and this <HI>Love</HI> is the holy Ghost, proceeding from the Fa|ther and the Son. God as he is Father hath made all things, and given man a Law. God in the dispensation of the Covenant of Works hath agreed within himself that the Son of God should as|sume unto himself an humane Nature, which is subject unto the Law of God. This glorious Person is God and Man in one Per|son, named <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> This glorious Person Jesus Christ, is a Person of more worth then all Mankinde beside. This glorious Person Jesus Christ came into this world, and offered to God by Covenant his own life in our stead&punc; and died for us to satisfie divine Justice for the sin of man: with this Sacrifice God hath said he is


<PB N="30" REF="000161_0033_0FA2B484889A31B8">
satisfied for the sin of man. Thus Jesus Christ hath honoured Gods Law, by satisfying of divine Justice, and now Jesus Christ hath power to pardon whom he will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are strange and deep things which you say: in this way I do see that a person is found that is able to pay a ransome to God, and satisfie his Justice. But still I am in the dark about my self, how shall I be interested in this Redemption wrought by Je|sus Christ? If you have obtained it, I have some hope that so may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I pray tell me how I may be made partaker of this great Redemption, from the condemnation of sin pronounced against me by the Law of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab</SPEAKER>
<P>According to my poor ability, as well as I can I will tell you, and I will tell you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow I have obtained it, and in the same way you also may obtain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>O how this hope, by your experience, beginneth to raise my heart I pray go on and declare it to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>God hath made a new Covenant of grace which he hath opened in the Gospel, and Jesus Christ hath published it to all the world: and the sum of it is this; That whosoever shall penitently turn from sin towards God, and believe in Jesus Christ, he shall have a pardon of all his sins, and be partaker of eternal life, through the grace and mercy of God in Jesus Christ. <HI>John</HI> 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that who|soever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>This puts me into another great difficulty: can I penitent|ly turn from sin, and believe in Jesus Christ? Alas, I know not how to go about such a work, much less do I know how to accom|plish the same; therefore I still am under great straights, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d know not what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say true, it is a work past your ability to do: But Jesus Christ hath undertaken two great works in the salvation of sinners. The first is to pacifie Gods Justice, and satisfie the Law, and to reconcile God toward us; and that he hath done and finish|ed effectually, when he was here on earth 2. Christ hath under|taken to conquer the world or all Gods Elect (for it is onely the Elect of God whom Christ hath undertaken for) and the Father and the Son have sent forth God the holy Ghost to effect this work: for none but God himself is able to convert a Soul, and create faith in the heart of man. We cannot do it of our selves&punc; neither you nor I can do it, but by the assistance of the Spirit of God, by the Word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still the difficulty lyeth before me, I am at a loss, and know not what to do. I fully believe I am not able to do it my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will help you as well as I can; and the Lord help you by his Word and Spirit. Your heart is now (in some measure) al|ready


<PB N="31" REF="000161_0034_0FA2B4850CA532A8">
turned away from sin; that part of the work is wrought in your heart, which I will demonstrate to you thus: I ask you, will you hereafter live and walk in the wayes of sin as you have former|ly done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, no: I hope God will keep me and help me; I will never live again as I have formerly done, I will binde my self from it. I abhor to do so, I will forsake them for ever: Lord help me so to do</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; therefore you are now converted from your sins: and who wrought this great Change in you? it was not your self did it, nor was it I that did it; I onely opened unto you the word of God, but the Spirit of God, by the conviction of the Law, and by the word of God, hath wrought this work in you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot gainsay you, I yield to what you say, and wonder at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the same manner the Spirit of God by the word is able to create Faith in you to believe in Jesus Christ. This work the Lord useth to work in us by the Promises of the Gospel. Now I will propound unto you at present but one Promise, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28, 29. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest unto your souls.</HI> Now I ask you, Are you weary and heavy laden with your sins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> yes, God knows I am so; I never felt the like distress in my Soul since I was born, sin is the bitterest thing in the world to my Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then hearken to this call of Christ, for he calls you in particular to come to him, and this coming is believing: are you willing to come to Christ, and ask a pardon of him, and beg his mercy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, with all my heart. Lord help me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then see the next words, what he promises, <HI>I will give you rest.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lord let it be so, according to thy Word and Promise, thy will be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, wait here, and see if God doth not quiet your Soul, and give you rest. Mean while I will further ask you in the next words, Are you willing to take upon you Christ his yoke, and this yoke consisteth of two parts: 1. The yoke of Commandments, to do whatever he commandeth. And 2. his yoke of Sufferings in this world for his Name sake: for now that you are converted, the carnal world will hate you, mock you, injure you, speak all evil against you, and it may be if they can they will kill you&punc; as they did Christ; but are you willing to suffer all for Jesus Christ his sake, who hath died for yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? And further, are you willing to learn meekness of Jesus Christ? for they are the next words; and I


<PB N="32" REF="000161_0035_0FA2B48673F37428">
do assure you, that you will have great need of patience, when you have done all the duties he commands, to suffer patiently what God himself shall inflict upon you by sicknesses, crosses and tempta|tions, or what wicked men shall inflict upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>These things which you speak are against the flesh and frame that I used to be in; and I do finde that they are not so fully kil|led, but that they have a little stirring in them when you propound these cases to me.</P>
<P>But the experience I have now found of the love of God, and of Jesus Christ to my Soul, doth lay such an engagement upon my heart, that I will, by his grace and assistance, be for him onely, serve him onely, do all that ever he shall command me, suffer whatever he shall impose upon me; I will no more be for my self, but for him, who hath done all this for me. Oh what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits to my poor Soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are surprized by the night, we must rest under these Trees this night. I do account this day well spent, though we have made but little progress toward the place of our intendment: but I have been about the work I came abroad upon, though not the persons I intended. Thus God doth over-rule the wayes of men; he foreseeth and ordereth that which we had no thoughts upon: and therefore in that we have spent this day in such Con|ference and Discourse, wherein we have seen so much of the pre|sence of Christ with us; let us now spend this night in prayers and praises unto the Lord, who hath found us before we sought for him. You were going about another business, you little thought of find|ing Jesus Christ by the way, and finding mercy to your Soul, a par|don of your sins, and to become a <HI>praying Indian.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth heighten my admiration. I acknow|ledge God hath thought of me when I thought not of him; he had a care of my Soul when I had no care of my self; God hath pluck|ed me out of darkness, and brought me into a most wonderful light, that I should be forced to see the wonderful things of Gods Law, &amp; of my eternal condemnation by it, my helpless and hopeless condition that I was in.</P>
<P>And then, that the Lord should open unto me a possibility of escape, that a ransome and remedy might be found by the infinite wisdome and mercy of God; and that Jesus Christ had not onely accomplished that great work, but offered the fruit and benefit of it to me&punc; and called me to rest in him, and to be trust my Soul with him for pardon of all my sins, and for eternal life in Jesus Christ. These things are matter of my admiration, and shall be to all eter|nity. My life remaining shall be spent in admiring, and in obeying and suffering, as you have now taught me; I shall account nothing too dear for Christ, who hath not accounted his own most precious life too dear for me. Whereas I am now instructed, that he being


<PB N="33" REF="000161_0036_0FA2B486F624B3D8">
God and Man in one person, his life was of more value then all the lives of all mankinde; and that he did not forbear to offer that precious life for me; I must, I will, by his grace assisting, admire at this mercy for ever: and therefore the motion that you made of spending this night in prayer and praises unto his holy Name, it is a most acceptable motion to my heart. My experience suggest|eth unto me matter abundantly to pray and praise his Name, but my ignorance is such as that I cannot tell how to utter my minde in words of knowledge suitable unto so great mercies as I have now experienced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your discourse doth lead me out to inform you in a great point of the grace and kingdome of Jesus Christ, and that is the gift and grace of Prayer, which the Spirit of Jesus Christ teach|eth every new born Soul to perform: for so the Scripture saith, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.15. <HI>He hath given the Spirit of his Son, whereby we cry,</HI> and crying is an earnest manner of praying; and the matter of our cry is to say <HI>Abba, Father,</HI> that is, to call God our Father, and to ask him a Childes portion in the Name of Jesus Christ, as he hath pro|mised, that whatever we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ, it shall be surely granted, either the same thing or a better; for we are foolish children, and know not what is best for our selves, but our Father doth: and therefore when we make our prayers and request to God, we must leave the matter to his love &amp; wisdome, to give us what, and when, and how he will.</P>
<P>And because we are ignorant what to pray for, therefore the Spi|rit of God who dwelleth in our heart, he is called the <HI>Spirit of Grace and of Supplication</HI>; and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26, 27. <HI>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit, because he maketh interces|sion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</HI> Where we see that our weakness is supplied by the assistance of the Spirit, and he help|eth us to pray for such things as please God, and in such a manner as pleaseth God. And this is the condition of every true convert|ed believer, that he can pray, and desires to pray, and is ever lift|ing up his heart to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in prayer: and therefore I like it well that my motion of spending this night in prayer, is so acceptable to you, a good sign it is that the Spirit of Jesus Christ hath taken possession of your Soul.</P>

<P>Christ hath taught us, <HI>When thou art converted, then strength|en thy brother,</HI> Luke 22.32. therefore you must pray for all the Church of God; you must especially pray for them that are weak, and tempted, and afflicted; and you must pray for them that are not yet converted, and for all Gods people, and for all Gods cause in all the world, and for the fulfilling of all Gods Promises.

<P>Our state in this world is not perfect, corruption is killed but in part; there be old roots remaining, which upon occasion offered will still be stirring, acting, appearing, as a tree that is cut down, the old roots will be growing, which must be kept down with a speedy cutting off. A field that is well weeded, will quick|ly produce new weeds again, out of that natural propensity of the earth to bring forth weeds; but a watchful and diligent husband|man will be often weeding over his Corn fields: and so will our hearts be sending forth new weeds of sin, but we must be daily di|ligent to watch and weed them out; our hearts have a natural pro|pensity to sin, and therefore must be kept with all diligence. And therefore that is the first counsel that I give you, out of the expe|rience of my own naughty heart.</P>

<P>The night spent in prayer hath let me finde a sweet taste in it, though I do already finde that it is a weariness to my flesh. I thank you for this Counsel, I desire I may remember and do it. What further Counsel will you give me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab</SPEAKER>
<P>You must be much conversant in the Word of God, and though you cannot yet reade the Word, yet you must get the help of others, and learn the word of God by heart; and you must meditate upon the same night and day, for so <HI>David</HI> did, Psal. 1.2. And the meditation on the Word will sanctifie the heart, and kill corruption, and will mightily help you to subdue it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt it will be difficult for me to learn to reade, I am dull of capacity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>A strong desire, diligence and constancy, will obtain any thing: and you must pray God to teach you, and to open your heart to learn: <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack wisdome, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and up&punc; raideth not, and it shall be given hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> And for a further help to you, my fourth Counsel is, That you diligently learn the Catechize, and by learning to reade that, you will learn to reade and understand the whole Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see my self very ignorant, and therefore I am very desi|rous to learn Catechism, because I have heard and do perceive that is the foundation of all knowledge in Religion, being wisely gathered out of the Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right about Catechism; we do therefore teach it our Children, that the principles of good knowledge may be sown and rooted in them from a Childe: and for that reason also do we send them to School, to learn to reade the Word of God, that they may be acquainted with the Word from a Childe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh what a loss is this to me, that I am to begin to learn Catechize and the Word of God now I am a man, which I might have been acquainted with from a Childe, had I been brought up among the <HI>praying Indians.</HI> How happy are your Children that are thus brought up. I suppose you are very diligent in this matter in Training up of your Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have great cause to judge our selves for too much negligence in this point. A fifth Counsel I give you is, That you be constant and diligent in the exercise of the Worship of God in your Family, in these points: 1. You must Morning and Even|ing pray in your Family, and teach them in Catechism, and read|ing of the Scriptures. 2. Alwayes before and after Meat you must pray and give thanks to God.</P>

<P>A sixth Counsel I give you is, That you do carefully re|member the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, and to come to the pub|lick

<SPEAKER>Waban.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY aged Uncle, I am glad that it hath pleased God once more to give me an opportunity to see you alive in this world. It is not unknown unto you, that I and many others have undertaken a new way of life, which is known to many by the name of <HI>Praying to God.</HI> The way that I formerly, and you still live in, is a way of worshipping the Devil, it is a way of dark|ness and sin: and though it is a way pleasant and easie to the flesh, yet it leadeth to destruction and eternal torments. Man is made for another life after this life is ended; and though our body dieth and turneth to dust, yet the Soul is immortal, it dieth not, but at the death of the body it departeth to a place of eternal being, either in glory, or in misery. If we pray to God with a right heart, penitently turn from sin to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, then we shall have a pardon granted us, and eternal happiness with Jesus Christ. But if we do not turn to God, but worship and serve the Devil, and walk in the wayes of sin, then at death our Soul must be dragged to hell, and there tormented for ever among the Devils, whom we have obeyed and served in this life. These things, and many more, we do perfectly know, and believe to be true by the Word of God, which is the Sun-light of the Soul, even as the Sun is the great light of the outward world.</P>
<P>God hath put it into my heart to desire that your Soul might be blessed for ever; and the Church hath sent me, and I come in the Name of Jesus Christ to tell you these things, and beseech you to turn from these vain and evil wayes, and to believe in Jesus Christ, that your sins may be pardoned, and that your Soul may be saved in eternal glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your love and desire of my good, I have no reason but to accept with kindness; but me thinks one thing in your discourse is doubtful. We see with our eyes, and know certainly that the


<PB N="37" REF="000161_0040_0FA2B48C44836540">
body dieth, and turneth to rottenness and dust, and why may not the Soul do so likewise? we see not what becometh of it, and to make such a stir, and change our course upon uncertainties, I have no liking to it, my Age inclineth me rather to be quiet, and not meddle with such unseen intricacies, utter for younger heads to minde.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our bodies are the product of the seed of man, and that is made out of the food we eat, and our food grows out of the earth, so that our bodies are made of refined earth; and there|fore at death turn to earth again, out of which it was made, and so God speaketh, <HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</HI> But the Soul is not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; it is a Spirit, of a purer nature then earthly things, and it is immediately created by God, and therefore dieth not. Besides, we are assured by many infallible proofs out of the Word of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd by evidence of good Reason, that the Soul is immortal, which point we are taught in our Catechism. And not onely so, but G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d hath taught us, that at the end of the world the body shall be raised again out of the dust, and the Soul and body joyned together again, and then the person shall be judged by Jesus Christ, according to their deeds done in the flesh: those that live and die in their sins, shall be turned into hell, to be torment|ed by and with the Devils; but they that turn to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, shall be judged to go with Christ to heaven, and be ever with him in eternal glory.</P>
<P>Therefore this consideration doth more sharpen my request and intreaties of you, how shall I endure to see this body of yours, which I so respect and love, and that Soul of yours also, to go a|way unto eternal torments. And I pray you consider what a wound and torment it will then be, to remember, I was exhorted and intreated to turn to God and live; mercy in Christ was offer|ed me, but I refused it: and therefore deservedly do you lose what you refused, and deservedly you suffer that torment you did choose, rather then to trouble your self with this business of pray|ing to God, and believing in Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>You do well to permit your sons to enter into a way of wisdome, and pray unto God; but I would propose two requests

unto you: 1. To do well for your self as well as for your Sons, for your soul is as preceious as their souls be And 2. the most effectual means to perswade your Sons unto this way of wisdome, is for you to set them an exa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple; if you should choose this way, then it is like that they would follow your example, but if you re|fuse it your self, there is the less hope that they will choose it: for it is a way hard to the flesh, and requires much subduing of lusts, which will rather be done in your decrepit Age, then by them in their flourishing youth.</P>

<P>Aged Sachem, now that you and we are refreshed and strengthned by this food, I will declare unto you strange News, to which I intreat your attendance a little while, and all the people here present. I am like a man that was looking for a shell, and found a Pearl of inestimable value, whereby he became very rich and renowned. I had a small occasion to come and visit you, grave Sachem, and by the way I met with this good man, a messenger of God; by whose discourse my blinde eyes are opened, my dead heart is made alive, my lame legs are inabled to walk in the way to heaven, where I shall enjoy an eternal Kingdome. Many mira|cles have been wrought upon me by the power of Gods Word, spoken to me by this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n: and that I may stir up your heart, and the hearts of the people here present to give diligent heed to what he saith, I will decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re unto you what passed between us. I was as you are, I lived as you live, I did as you do, and as the rest of our Countrymen and Neighbours do; I followed the sports, pleasures, vanities, and courses that other men, and you, to this day walk in. But I was not aware how blinde, and dead, and vile, and wicked I was in the sight of God; nor was I aware that I was running on in a pleasant delightful way, which led me down to hell and eter|nal damnation.</P>
<P>But when I met this man, he discoursed with me about these things; he opened unto me, by the Word of God, the great Ma|jesty of God, his Holiness, Justice, and Good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess; how God had made this great world, and all things in it, both things above&punc; and things below; how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made man an eminent Creature, gave him do|minion over all the creatures here below; &amp; gave him an holy, just

and good Law, in Ten Commandments, under the order of a Co|venant of Works, and if he kept and obeyed this Law, he should live in glory and happiness forever&punc; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he did break this Law, and sin against God, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t great Majesty of heaven, then he should be answerably and justly puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d with eternal torments in hell fire, with the Devil and his Angels for evermore: and this Law was for himself and all his posterity, in who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e stead he stood as a publick person.</P>
<P>Now he informed me, that <HI>Adam</HI> the first man sinned by the tem|ptation of evil Angels, which rebelled against God, and turned Devils: by their temptation <HI>Adam</HI> need, and turned rebel against God, and served, believed and obeyed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Devil and therefore by the Law of God he was jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d and condemned, and all his posteri|ty. All this I found to be true in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y own experience, for I went on in the same rebellion&punc; breaking the holy Law of God every day both in thought, word and deed, obeying the Devil and his tem|ptations, serving the lusts of my flesh, and filthy minde: I walked in the broad, easie, pleasant way that leadeth to destruction; so that I have deserved to be damned a thousand thousand times: and the greatness of the Majesty of God against whom I sinned, did breed terrour in my soul; my just condemnation by the Law of God, was evident to me as the light; Gods pure and unchange|able Justice, which sentenced me by the Law unto hell, I saw I could not possibly answer, seeing I am a poor finite worm, and what have I to satisfie infinite offended Justice? and therefore my soul mourned and lamented, and sunk into despair; for Gods Justice is unchangeable, and his Law must be satis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, which I am never able to do, and therefore I must be eternally damned under that just sentence. I durst not pray God to pardon my transgression, by any absolute soveraign act o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mercy, for then he should have of|fended his own Justice, which is unchangeable, and abolished his own Law, whose perfection is such that it must be fulfilled and sa|tisfied; and to satisfie Gods just Law, was not in the power of any finite creature, Man or Angel: and therefore I despaired, no ran|some could be found in all the world for me a poor sinner. Oh the bitterness that my soul felt, in the horrour of my damned estate! No tongue can utter what my soul felt. I had a taste of hell tor|ments in my soul; my meditation of Gods Omnis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ience, whereby he knew all my sins, not onely open, but secret ones, brought in|numerable sins to my remembrance, one of which was enough to damn me, but I had mountains of guilt heaped upon my distressed soul; the impossibility for me to satisfie divine Justice, and the im|possibility of pardon without satisfaction, because God cannot be unjust, and his Law is unchangeable: Such meditations cast me in|to the horrible pit of darkness and desperation. <HI>The redemption, the soul is precious, it ceaseth for ever,</HI> Psal. 4.8.</P>
<P>

<PB N="40" REF="000161_0043_0FA2B48E7752A8A0">Then God opened the mouth of this dear Servant of his, who told me that the infinite mercy and wisdome of God had found out a ransome, a way to satisfie Justice, and fulfil the Law, and to save poor condemned sinners, and that he himself had found mercy in that way. This bred some hope in my soul, and stayed me from sinking quite down, when I heard of a possibility: but still I was in distressing doubt and fear that it was but some delusion, because I could not see a possibility for Man or Angel, or any Creature, to satisfie and give a ransome to infinite Justice.</P>
<P>Then he declared to me, that it is true that no Creature could give a ransome to satisfie Justice, but God himself was able to sa|tisfie the infinite Justice of God. To that I yielded, that God himself might satisfie his Justice, but still I was in the dark, I could not see this could possibly be. Then he opened me, that adored Doctrine of God his being One and Three, how God was one in Essence, three in Persons, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost; how the Father doth by an eternal intelle|ctual act conceive the Image of Himself, as being the only adequate Object he understands himself; and this is called the Begetting of the Son, by an intellectual conception of his own Image: and these two Subsistencies, do by an eternal act of Volition love each other; and this Love is the third Person in Trinity, proceeding from both the Father and the Son.</P>
<P>Now the eternal Majesty of God agreed within himself, that God the Son, the second Person in Trinity, should assume humane Nature to himself, and become a man, subject to the Law. This glorious Person is the greatest subject that ever the Law had, and this glorious Person is able perfectly to fulfil the Law, and perfect|ly to pay a ransome satisfactory to infinite Justice, who hath done it. This depth of divine Wisdome my soul admired, and shall do to eternity.</P>
<P>But still I was at a loss how I should be interested in the ransome that this glorious Person hath paid. Then did this Messenger of God declare unto me, that this glorious Person Jesus Christ had undertaken both parts of this work: First to atone, and reconcile God to man, by paying the ransome required, and by perfect fulfil|ling the Law: Secondly, to subdue the soul and will of man to turn, and submit to be reconciled to God. But this work of converting a soul to God is such, that as no man can convert him|self, so no other Creature is able to do it, onely God himself can do it; and for that end, both the Father and Son have sent forth the holy Ghost, the eternal Spirit, to work upon the hearts of men, and to create the work of Faith in them by the Word, and then to take possession of, and dwell in believing souls, to mortifie their lusts, to sanctifie their hearts and lives, and to lead them in the way of grace unto glory.</P>
<P>

<PB N="41" REF="000161_0044_0FA2B49001E69E38">And he further declared to me, that this blessed Spirit of God, by the Word of God, had already begun this great work in my soul: for a new light is set up in my soul, a wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beyond the reach of man; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> light hath convinced me of sin, and of my my damned estate by sin; it h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d made a separation and divorce be|twixt sin and my soul; it had cut me off the old stock, and laid my soul down at the foot of Christ, capable with all humble thank|fulness to accept salvation, not by any merit of mine, but by free-grace of Christ unto a vile and unworthy sinner. This I could not deny, but I did finde such conviction, and such a submi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sion to Christ: and this he declared to be the first step and beginning of the work of sound Conversion.</P>
<P>I crave your patience for a few words more.

The <HI>Vineyard</HI> where men labour, is the Church, and this way of praying to God; and sheweth that it is a laborious and a good work, and will cause us to bring forth good fruits, grapes and wine, which is pleasing to God and man. But beware of bringing forth sowre grapes; especially suffer no briars and thorns, but cut them down, and root them up, and cast them out.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Lord of this Vineyard</HI> is Jesus Christ, who calleth all men to come into this his Vineyard, and do these works. And this day I do in the Name of the Lord Jesus call you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to pray to God, come and work in this Vineyard. Hearken to this Call, and be no longer idle, follow your sins no longer, you have lived in sin long enough, stay no longer, but come in when you are called. Happy are you, if you obey and come; woe be to you, if you re|fuse.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here be the several seasons of mens coming in, or the several Ages of men that do come in.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some come in while it is morning, that is, while they be young: therefore I call you Boyes, Youths and Girls, come you unto the Lords Vineyard, and give unto God the first-fruits of your dayes.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord went forth at the <HI>third hour,</HI> and called in young men and young women into his Vineyard: Hearken therefore you young men and young women to the Call of God, and come in.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lord went forth at the <HI>ninth hour,</HI> that is, he called in men and women full grown, to ripeness of parts, and strength; you are called this day to come into the Lords Vineyard; be you perswaded to come in, and serve the Devil no longer: now turn unto the Lord.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Lord went forth the <HI>eleventh hour,</HI> that is, a little bfore night; and this doth mean you old men, and old women, come you into the Lords Vineyard&punc; you see the Lord will accept you if you come. Do not think you are too old to serve the Lord; if your dayes be near finished, you had the more need come in quick|ly, lest you die in your sins, and perish for ever.</P>
<P>When he had finished, an Objection was made by one; <HI>We dare not come in to pray to God, for we hear you are very severe if any be found<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> sin, of lust or the like, you Whip them and punish them, that maketh us afraid to pray to God.</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Wab.</HI> God hath appointed punishments of sin to be Phy|sick for their souls; and though Physick be bitter and sharp, yet its very wholesome, good and needful. If you were invited to dwell at such a Town where there is a Physician, would you say, No, I will not dwell there, because if I be sick I must take Physick; sure you would therefore go dwell at that place. So it is in this


<PB N="43" REF="000161_0046_0FA2B494B92E3EA0">
case; you should therefore desire to pray to God, because they use Physick to heal the sickness of your souls.</P>

<P>In these words see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se three things:</P>
<P N="1">1. Christ Jesus taketh possession of the heathen, and utmost ends of the earth: and this is one description of our Country. And now Jesus Christ calleth us to come to him. Some of us have sub|mitted unto Christ, and he hath mercifully accepted us, and so he will accept you, if you will come in unto him.</P>
<P N="2">2. See what Christ will do to them that will not come in; <HI>He will break them with a Rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces like a potters vessel.</HI> Thus Christ will deal with our sins, if we submit to him. But if we will not submit to him, he will thus deal with our persons, and destroy them that refuse to serve him, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.27.</P>
<P N="3">3.

We do unto you, according to the holy Ex|ample which we finde, <HI>John</HI> 1.40, to 47. where <HI>Andrew</HI> called <HI>Pe|ter,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> himself called <HI>Philip,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> called <HI>Nathaniel.</HI> So we are come this day unto you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, to

We pray you to consider, that your love to your people should oblige you to do them all the good you can.

<P>Often have I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eard of this great matter of praying unto God, and hitherto I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve refused. Mr. <HI>Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> junior, while he was alive&punc; attempted it, but I did not hearken unto his perswasion.

I confess, I did neglect and despise the offer, and lost that opportunity. Since that time God hath afflicted and chastised me, and my heart doth begin to break, and I have some serious thoughts of accepting the offer, and turning to God, to become a <HI>praying Indian,</HI> I my self, and all my pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple.

<P>The first Objection that I have is this, Because you <HI>praying In|dians</HI> do rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct your Sachems, and refuse to pay them Tribute; in|somuch that if any of my people turn to pray unto God.

In his life time we accepted his Bro|ther, at his request; and <HI>Msquammog</HI> his leaving us, is his own act and not ours. And therefore, beloved Sachem, let not your heart fear that praying to God will alienate your people from you; nay, be assured it will more firmly oblige their hearts unto you.

And what greater bene|ficence can you do unto them, then to further them in Religion, whereby they may be converted, pardoned, sanctified and saved.</P>

<P>All that my Brother hath said I second, and can bear wit|ness unto it; onely I will adde one thing more&punc; of which I know more then he doth, because it was acted in the Town where I live&punc; There was some subtile endeavour to have mingled the <HI>praying</HI> and <HI>non-praying Indians,</HI> and to have reduced the <HI>praying Indians</HI> un|der


<PB N="46" REF="000161_0049_0FA2B49796B05980">
the power of <HI>non praying Indians,</HI> contrary to publick and evident Conditions. Against this, did some of the wiser sort (who saw the Trap) firmly stand; giving this Reason: The Fox came to the Lambs door, and would fain come in, but the Lambs refused. Then the Fox desired to let him put in but one Claw; the Lambs refused, saying, If he get in but one Claw, he will not rest till he have wringled in his whole body.

<SPEAKER>Keit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have another Objection stronger then this; and that is, If I pray to God, then all my men that are willing to pray to God will (as you say) stick to me, and be true to me; but all such as love not and care not to pray to God, especially such as hate praying to God, all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se will forsake me, yea will go and adjoyn themselves unto other S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chems that pray not to God: and so it will come to pass, that if I b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a praying Sachem, I shall be a poor and weak one, and easily be trod upon by others, who are like to be more potent and numerous; and by this means my Tribute will be small, and my pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple sew, and I shall be a great loser by pray|ing to God.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess that this is a strong temptation, and requireth much Self-denial and Faith to conflict with it. I pray consider what Counsel Jesus Christ giveth in this case, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.24. <HI>Let a man deny h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mself take up his cross, and follow me.</HI> I confess that this is harsh Doctrine to flesh and blood; but I will tell you a Cordial against it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.29 <HI>Every one that hath forsaken Hou|ses or Brethren, or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Chil|dren, or Lands for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Names sake, shall receive an hundred fold and shall inherit everlasting life.</HI> Trust God in this Promise, and see if he do not perfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it. And be assured, it is better to trust God in a way of well doing, then to trust to wicked and vile men in a way of sin. If God will punish you, all your men, especially the worst of them, cannot save you; but if all your men should for|sake


<PB N="47" REF="000161_0050_0FA2B4984CB99180">
you, and yet you choose Christ, and be true to him, then Christ will certainly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke care of you. And further, this is but a fear that humane Reason maketh; try the Lord, it may be he will make all your men to stick the closer to you. You think the better sort will stick to you, it is but the loss of the worser sort, at the worst, and if you trust in the Lord, he can over-rule the hearts of the worst of men, and they shall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forsake you. Besides you may put it to the trial, put it to the publick Vote; if you should do so, I do think that they will all promise to stick unto you if you pray to God: and then this Objection is cut off in the beginning of the work. Consider also what Christ hath said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.29, 30. he commands such as come to him, to <HI>take up my yoke, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly of heart, and ye shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rest to your souls: For my yoke is easie, and my burthen light.</HI> You fear that this will be burthensome, heavy, and to your loss; try the Lord if he do not make this Objection easie and light unto you: and see if it do not prove that you are more afraid then hurt. Christ will not suffer any body to lose by him, at last. Nay you shall be a certain and a great gainer by it, both in this world, and in the world to come.</P>

<P>As my Brother hath said, I acknowledge this to be (in ap|pearance at least) a strong temptation. This was the temptation of <HI>Josias,</HI> that drew him to his Apostacy, he forsook his praying people, and adhered unto those who did not pray to God: but this was because his own heart did not love praying to God&punc; and did better like of the wicked wayes of the <HI>non praying Indians.</HI> But what got he at last by adhering to the worst sort of his Sub|jects? When he was in distress they all f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rsook him, which his praying Subjects would not have done, if he would have adhered unto them. Likewise this very thing which you propose, was a temptation to <HI>Cutshamoquin</HI>; His praying to God did make such of his people as loved not that way, to waver in their subjection to him, and it did begin to make him waver in the matter of pray|ing to God: but God did mercifully preserve him, and kept him stedfast to his dying day. But this he did, he went sometimes a|mong them, he used them kindly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e treated them with gentle per|swasion, without compulsion; by such wayes be so carried the matter, that they forsook him not. And I do not doubt but that the matter may be so ordered and carried, that you may be secured from that danger, which seemeth to lie in your Objection. But indeed the true Reason why sundry of <HI>Cuts<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">moquin</HI> his men left him, whereby he fell under poverty, was this, He sold unto the <HI>English</HI> all our Lands which lay by the Sea-side and Salt water&punc; save onely one Field; and then it was, that they went to such other places as they liked better. And this one Field also, <HI>Josias</HI> sold away; and the Inland place, where we now live, Mr. <HI>Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> pro|cured

<P>I perceive that in your pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and in your Churches, all are brought to an equality; Sachems and people they are all fellow-brethren in your C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urches; Poor and Rich are e|qually priviledged; the Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the lowest of the people, hath as much weight as the Vote of the Sachem.

<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<P>This also I confess is a great and weighty Point, and must be looked upon with much prudence and caution. The weight of a Vote lieth not so much in the man, as in the matter wherein he Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth. A poor wise man m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y give a better Reason then a rich man, or a Rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and then it is the Reason that prevaileth, not the man. We must all be ruled by the Word of God, both Sachems and people. The Word of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the mouth of a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r man must be regarded for the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not for the mans sake, be he rich or poor. The management of Church Liberties is a narrow edge, and may easily be miscarried, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rove hurtful; which difficulty must be helped by good conduct: the well-ordering of a Church is a point of great wisdome and care; but we must not therefore fly off from a Rule, because it is difficult, but it must be acted with the more fear, care and prayer.</P>
<P>There is such a Rule in the Gospel way of the Churches, as E|quality of Vote among Believers in the matters of Jesus Christ: And herein is a great point of Self denial in Sachems and chief men, to be eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al to his Brethren in the things that appertain to Christ, who is no respecter of persons: So it is said, <HI>Col.</HI> 3 11. <HI>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, Circumcision nor Vncircum|cision, Barbarian, Scy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ond nor free, but Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and in all.</HI> And as Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">akes all Believers equal in Christ, so doth t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Order of the Gospel: all that are in Gospel order, are equally concerned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffairs of Jesus Christ.

<P>All that my Brother h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th said is weighty: I will adde a word further to the edge of your Objection.

<P>What second thoughts may come into my minde I cannot tell, but at present I finde nothing in my minde to oppose against what you say. But yet there is another thing that I am much a|fraid of, and that is your Church Admonitions and Excommuni|cations: I hear that your Sachems are under that yoke. I am a sinful man as well as others, but if I must be admonished by the Church, who are my Subjects, I know not how I shall like that.

<P>Still your Objections are great and weighty. Sin is the sic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ness of the soul, even as diseases are the sickness of the body. Admonitions in the Lord, by the holy Scriptures are the Physick of the Soul, even as outward Medicines are P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ysick to the body. Now if your body be sick, you will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Physick because it is bitter or sharp, and difficult to bear. No, but you will bear it patiently, because you know it is wholesome, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a means to cure your sickness. The same I say about the sickness of your soul, that Medicine which God hath appointed to purge awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your sin, you must patiently submit unto, because it is wholesome and good for your soul. Yea, and you must be so much the more care|ful and willing to submit thereunto, by how much the danger of soul-sicknesses are deeper and greater then bodily sicknesses be. A bodily sickness, at the worst, doth but kill the body but soul-sicknesses, if not cured, do damn both body and soul in hell, with the Devil and his Angels for ever. It is a desperate danger to let soul sicknesses go uncured. It is pleasant and delightful to the flesh to sin without controll, but remember wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the end of it will be. <HI>Solomon</HI> that wise King saith, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 11.9. <HI>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in thy you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, and walk in the wayes of thy heart, and in the sight of thy eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement.</HI> This is a trembling word. <HI>Felix</HI> a great Ruler trembled when he heard that word, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.25. It is therefore against all wisdome to refuse


<PB N="51" REF="000161_0054_0FA2B49B438FED20">
to be subject to soul-physick. It is a great mercy when God giveth a skilful Physician to cure our bodies, but it is a greater mercy to have a skilful Physician to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l and cure our souls. This there|fore is so fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from being a discouragement from praying to God, as that it is rather an encouragement.

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to adde a word or two by way of lenitive. Though the matter be harsh and bitter, yet the manner of applying must be with all reverence, gentleness, meekness, tenderness, and love, so as to avoid all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xasperation or provocation. So the Lord hath commanded, <HI>Galat.</HI> 6.1. <HI>If a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual&punc; restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, con|sidering thy self lest thou also be tempted.</HI></P>
<P>And for your fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther encouragement, we finde in the Scripture that great Kings and rulers have meekly submitted to this soul-physick. <HI>David</HI> was sharply reproved by the Prophet, and he meek|ly submitted to it, 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 12. and so it was with <HI>Eli,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.27. Let it not therefore be unacceptable unto you, to imitate so great, so good Examples. If Sachems might sin, and no body might ad|monish them, because they be rulers, and the Ministers and people are the subjects, it were the most miserable condition in the world to be a Sachem or a ruler, they run to hell without controll, and no body may say unto him, Why do you so? It is said, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.33. <HI>Tophet is ordained of old, yea for the King i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is prepared.</HI> If God have ordained hell for Sachems, then sure he hath ordained means to keep them out of it, as well as for other men; for <HI>God desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent and live.</HI> If therefore you desire to escape hell, and to go to heaven, submit your soul to such means as God hath appointed to bring you to repentance and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lvation. When you put the Objection, you said you are a sinful man as well as others: therefore your own heart will tell you that you have need of such helps as God hath ap|pointed to bring you to repentance, else you cannot be saved.</P>

Know this, that in the rowlings of my thoughts, the disquiet turnings and tum|blings of my minde, do oft-times molest me with variety of pas|sions. I am sometimes in grief and anguish of minde, especially when I over look my life past, and remember the many sins and follies that I have stained my life and honour withall, I think with my self, What a fool have I been, that for the love of a lust, which Dogs and brute Creatures delight in, that I, a Man, a Sachem, should be so besotted, as to stain my honour, wound my Soul, of|fend God, and expose my self to eternal damnation, and all this for a short delight that is gone with a blast, and leaves nothing be|hinde but shame and sorrow; and these are durable and indelible, a sad effect of sensual pleasures.

But I pray con|sider at what a dear rate you purchase your quiet in your old ways of sin and darkness, which lead you to hell, when you will compel all your people to live in sin and darkness, for fear lest when they finde the light of Gods Word, they should molest and trouble you in your lusts and sins.</P>

<P>I will adde a few words to what my Brother hath spoken. I have heard that in the other part of the World there be a certain people who are called <HI>Papists,</HI> whose Ministers and Teachers live in all manner of wickedness and lewdness, and permit and teach the people so to do: and these wicked Ministers will not suffer the people to reade the Word of God, and pretend the same reason as you do, Because they be ignorant. But the true reason is the same which you plainly speak out, lest by the knowledge of the VVord, they should have light to see into their vileness, and mo|lest them in their lusts and sins. And they are so cruel, that if they finde any one that readeth the word of God, they will kill him. They choose rather to lead all their people with them to hell, then to suffer them to see the light whereby they may be saved, lest when they see the light, they should discover their filt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ouble them in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to hell. But God doth account these men Murtherers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath threatned to bring upon them fearful destruction, to revenge the blood of Gods people whom they have murthered. Therefore I pray you to consider, that the like ven|geance from God will fall upon you, if you will not suffer your people to search into, and learn the word of God.</P>

<P>This Question is one great Principle in Religion; and I cannot take a surer and better course to answer it, then by decla|ring the Answer that is given in our Catechism unto the Question, and by opening some of the Texts of Scripture, which are there brought for the proof and manifestation thereof.</P>
<P>The Question is, <HI>What is the Word of God?</HI> The Answer is, It is the Will of God written in the Bible, whereby he rightly guideth man, in every thing in this world, and whereby he bringeth us to eternal salvation.

<P>The word and will of God written in a Book, whereby we may not onely hear it with our ears, when it is spoken by others, but we may see it with our eyes, and reade the writing our selves. And this is a great benefit to us, to have Gods word and will writ|ten; for a word spoken is soon gone&punc; and nothing retaineth it but our Memory, and that impression which it made upon our minde and heart; but when this word is written in a Book, there it will abide, though we have forgotten it, and we may reade it over a thousand times, and help our weak memories, so that it shall ne|ver be forgotten; yea, and such as cannot have an opportunity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earing the word, yet they may alwayes have an opportunity of reading the word, because it is written in the Bible, which they have by them in their houses, and may reade in it night and day.

But although my heart doth begin to reverence that Book for the sake of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he matter contained in it, yet I desire that you would proceed to give me your grounds why you believe that it is Gods word, because I shall t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en reverence the Word, not onely for the matters sake, but also for the Authors sake. Good words spoke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by a good man, do obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in respect; much more may the words that God speaketh, command all reve|rence.</P>
<P>This Point also being a great Principle in Religion, I will take the same course in it, as I did in the former. I will shew you what Answer we are taught in our Catechism, and I will touch some of the proofs.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first Reason to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is, Because they teach us the first Creation of the World, and all things in it, which no man nor Angel doth know or can teach, onely God; and this is proved in the first Chapter of <HI>Gene|sis</HI>&punc; where we reade the wonderful work of God in the Creation of the World, where man was last made.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Reason is from the holiness and perfection of the word of God. No man or Angel could give so holy&punc; pure and per|fect a Law, as G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds Law is, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.8, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 10, 11. also <HI>Psal.</HI> 12.6. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The third Reason is, Because the word of the Lord is con|firmed by such Miracles, as onely God himself is able to perform. <HI>Moses</HI> the first writer of Scripture&punc; did many great Miracles, in <HI>Egypt,</HI> in the Red Sea, and in the VVilderness; so did many other Prophets: but especially Jesus Christ did many wonderful Mira|cles, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did the Apostles&punc; by which our Faith is confirmed, that their writings are the word of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because the Scriptures doth reveal unto us Jesus Christ, and salvation by Christ, according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This no man or Angel could ever have found out, onely God&punc; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and hath committed to us the word of Reconciliation</HI> John 5.39. <HI>Sear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in them ye think to finde eternal li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: and they are they that tes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ie of me.</HI> Therefore they are the word of God</P>
<P N="5">5. Because the word of God doth convert the soul from sin and Satan, unto God.

<P>I Have now lived one Sabbath: many a Sabbath have I been dead, and followed works of darkness and sin, when I should have been following the Lord in such wayes of Worship, as yesterday was spent in. I am wounded at my heart to remember what I have done upon the Sabbath-day, I have served the Devil, and lust and sins of all s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts, even upon the Sabbath-dayes The sins that I have committed do render me vile in the sight of God, and the time wherein I have committed many of them, doth ren|der me more vile in the eyes of the Lord my Judge. You said yesterday, that Christ Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath, and re|quires all men to spend that day in his service; and when Christ Jesus shall judge the world, he will examine all men how they spent every Sabbath. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wretched man that I am, what answer shall I make, though I am a Sachem here on earth, I shall be but a subject in the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dgement.

God hath numbr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d all my wayes, my thoughts, my words and works and I feel now that my Conscience remem|breth them also, though it hath been asleep in the times of my ig|norance and profaneness. Oh I am a wretch: I should have been an example to my people, an example of virtue, of wisdome and of praying to God, but I have done quite contrary to my duty: I have been an example of lust, of profaneness, yea of all sin; and in particular of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is great sin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> profaning the Sabbath: my h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt is wounded with the sense of this sin especially, and that forceth my troubled Conscience to gall and afflict my soul with the remembrance of all my sins. But why say I all? I now finde my sins are numberless: my own personal sins are many, great and vile, my heart doth loath my self to remember them, they make me an abhorring to God. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t moreover and besides my own personal sins, other mens sins I am guilty of; Oh how many have sinned upon my account, many wayes?

<P>The doctrine of the Sabbath is a great Point in Religion. It is one of the Ten Moral, Univers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Commandments of God, which are required of all Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kinde; and the fourth Command, a chief Hinge of all the rest. By a religious keeping of the Sab|bath, we act our obedience to all the Commands. By profaning the Sabbath, we turn all Religion and good Order out of doors, and set open a door unto all sin and wickedness, so weighty a matter is the good keeping of the Sabbath-day. For the opening of the Sabbath, I know not a better way, then to open (briefly) the fourth Command; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ich I shall do, by laying it out into six parts.</P>

<P>Alas, your sorrowful countenance doth indeed discover, that your minde is oppressed with grief, and in such cases men are miserable comforters; God onely knoweth how to speak a word of Comfort to the heart, he made the heart of man, he knoweth all the sorrows and griefs thereof; and usually God doth afflict the heart with grief, out of great love, that he might call the distressed soul to come to him, and to make its griefs known to him, and he is very gracious and pitiful to such afflicted souls: for Christ hath said&punc; <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come unto me ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> My first Counsel therefore is, that you would pray unto God, and believe in Jesus Christ, and he will surely give you rest.

My Counsel is, mingle hope with your fear, <HI>viz.</HI> that God doth outwardly afflict you, that he might drive your distressed soul into the bosome of Jesus Christ, who will graciously pardon all your sins, and save your soul from those eternal flames, which you so much dread. It is Gods usual way of grace, to put his Lambs into distress, that he might cause them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly for refuge into his bo|some; and I hope that it is his meaning so to deal with you, be|cause I see that his afflicting hand doth so kindly melt your heart, and causeth you to seek refuge to save you from those everlasting burnings.

<P>You have prevented me, or rather the Spirit of God hath put into your heart by power and grace, that which I intended to have presented to you by way of Advice and Counsel, namely, To be frequent and abundant in reading the Scriptures, for you see that all Soul-cordials are laid up there, fetch them out therefore from that divine Treasury, and make use of them for your com|fort.

<P>

<PB N="76" REF="000161_0073_0FA2B4AF768E9168">And whereas you say that your sorrows and griefs are but world|ly sorrow: I answer, That the question is not what kinde of sor|row it is, so much, as what the effects of it is; for no matter what the sorrow is, if it drive the soul to Christ; our salvation is by Christ, and not by sorrow: the use of sorrow is to imbitter sin, and the world, and to drive the soul to Christ for relief and rest; if worldly sorrow, or rather sorrow about worldly things do this, it hath its end, and proves to be a godly sorrow. Sorrows are not to merit any thing from God, but to force the afflicted soul to fly to him for refuge. We shall finde examples in Scripture, where sorrows about worldly things have effectually driven the soul to fly to God for refuge. <HI>Psal</HI> 88.18. <HI>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</HI> This was an out|ward affliction, and yet in the first verse of that Psalm, it drives him to fly and cry to the <HI>God of his salvation</HI>; and this is an act of faith. So <HI>Psal.</HI> 35.15. <HI>But mine adversaries they rejoyced, they ga|thered themselves together, yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not. With hypocritical meekers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeth</HI>; that is, some broke jests upon him at their Taverns and Tiplings, and others scorned him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all these were outward afflictions, but they drove <HI>David</HI> to fly and cry to God, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. <HI>Lord, how long wilt thou l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ok on? rescue my soul,</HI> &amp;c. and this is an act of faith. So it was with <HI>Iob</HI> in his affliction, <HI>Iob</HI> 30.8, 9, 10. the basest of the people made songs and jests upon him; but mark what end God made with <HI>Iob.</HI> So <HI>Iames</HI> speaks, <HI>Iam.</HI> 5.12. Therefore whatever your griefs be, turn them into prayers, and cry to God for relief, and then your grief hath a sanctified end, and you will at last learn to say after <HI>David,</HI> in that high strained string of Faith and Expe|rience, <HI>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes,</HI> Psal. 119.71. And <HI>ver.</HI> 67&punc; of that Psalm, <HI>Before I was af|flicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word.</HI> And therefore what though your afflictions be outward afflictions, seeing God is pleased mercifully to bless them unto your spiritual and eternal good.</P>
<P>But I further observe, that sundry of your expressions do hold forth a spiritual sorrow for your sin, and a fear of Gods wrath, and an earnest desire to flee from, and escape wrath to come. I pray therefore express your self what sorrows and griefs you have of that kinde; for although such sorrows do not deserve any thing at Gods hand, yet they are of a more spiritual nature, and spring from a deep reverence and fear of God, and do more immediately and effectually drive the soul for refuge to Jesus Christ, who onely delivereth the soul from the guilt and condemnation of sin. Utter some drops of those soul-wounding terrours, which afflict you in the sense of your sin guiltiness.</P>

<P>Still my soul admireth to see the great use is to be made of the word of God, which doth engage my soul more and more, to a more frequent use of the Scriptures. Lord Jesus help me to perform it.</P>
<P>My fore-mentioned griefs about my outward condition, are but the Porch of those troubles that lodge in my distressed soul. When I look down into the dungeon of my heart, and the dunghill of my life, I am filled with an abhorrence of my self, and wonderment at Gods patience, to suffer such a wretch as I am to live. I know much of the sins of others, but I know more by my self, then I know by any body else, considering circumstantial aggravations. I can truly say with <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15. <HI>sinners, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom I am chief.</HI> If my Companions have mis-led me, or my leaders have caused me to erre, it may aggravate their sin, but be no excuse or apo|logie for mine; I have done as evil as I could, and had not God hampered me with outward affliction and trouble, it is not to be said by man how vile I should have been. It is sometimes a quiet|ing argument to my heart, to be patient under my outward crosses, because they be Mustard on the Worlds Nipples, to keep me from surfetting upon the Creature. If I look into the glass of Gods Law, and behold the face of my life, and of my soul, as they are there represented, I am afraid of my self, I ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orre my self, I am confounded. Gods Sabbaths I have profaned&punc; Gods Word I have neglected; Gods Grace I have despised and resisted; I have bro|ken the whole Law of God, every Command have I violated: for there be some acts of sin that I never did actually commit, yet the habit of sin is in me, and in inclination and desire I am guilty of it: and for a foundation of this mountainous heap of guilt, I am guilty of <HI>Adams</HI> fall, the first, the worst, the root of all the sins of the sons of men. My sinful habit and disposition by nature, doth viciously incline me to sin, against my desires, purposes, promises, and resolutions. When I strive and labour, and cry and pray a|gainst my sins, yet upon the opportunity and occasion offered, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in will return; I am weak, that is strong; I am subdued, and that prevaileth. <HI>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?</HI></P>
<P>When I consider the infinite Justice of God offended, the infinite Wrath of God provoked, the eternal Law of God violated, and the eternal torments provided and prepared in hell for sinners, and the insuperableness of my sin, by any means I can use, it will pre|vail over me, it will keep me in bondage, it will inslave me, and I fear it finally will damn me. In these considerations my soul is sunk and drowned. If therefore there be any Balm for my sore, any succour for my distressed soul, shew me the way how I shall escape these everlasting burnings, that are the just recompence of my transgressions.</P>

in the heart by faith laying hold on Christ, and from him receiving the Spirit, to dwell in him, and to form this new creature in his heart. Now what acts of life doth this babe perform? they are two: 1. By mortification and repentance he purgeth out all his sins; and this act of life you effectually do by your penitent con|fessions. The second act of life is, he desires the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby. The new creature is fed by the same means by which it was begotten: the word of God is the seed of God to beget the new creature, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9. and then the word of God is milk to feed and nourish the new creature. Now this is the thing that I observe in you, that as a new born babe you desire the milk of the word: and note this word, <HI>Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere milk</HI>; a living babe of Christ cannot abide humane mixtures added to the word of God; he loves the pure word, he cannot rellish mix|tures.</P>

<P>My dearest friend, God hath made you an instrument in his hand to lay before me unspeakable consolation; and I cannot deny but I feel it in my heart, I am another man then what I was, I looked on my self the most miserable of men, I now am happy being united to Christ. O blessed change! I am in admiration at this, I admire the grace of Christ to a dead, lost, damned sinner. I am come into a new world, I have other desires then I had, and other purposes; I see things in another frame then I was wont to see them. I must live a new life, and steer a new course.</P>
<P>But in this point my soul desires to begin, I am not mine own, I am the servant of Jesus Christ, he died for me, and by his grace I desire to live unto him. And now I finde my self greatly to need Counsel how to order my self in my future course; what shall I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Lord, who hath done so much for me? My dear friend, your Counsel hath been greatly owned and blessed by the Lord for my new birth, I desire to have great respect to your Counsel for the ordering of my wayes in my new life.</P>
<P>You do partly know that my people, and some chief ones among them, have had but a smal measure of respect for me, but I have great reason to overlook it, and bury it, because in his infinite mercy C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rist hath turned it about for my better good; my heart telleth me that I must seek the good of my people, how to manage that work wisely, is my difficulty, wherein I need your Counsel. I would to God that all my people were as I am, and tasted and felt what I have found; but that is not yet so. I desire to bring them to be the Lords people, how I shall accomplish that, is my great difficulty. You know I have been frequently among you <HI>praying I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dians</HI>&punc; and in my heart have ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered to you, and it may be that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the less acceptation for it; but I leave that God. I mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> do and perform the trust, ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rge and duty that my Lord Jesus hath committed to me. My question therefore is, How shall I


<PB N="81" REF="000161_0078_0FA2B528D678DE60">
comport with the present affairs, and state of things? how shall I bring the matter about, to bring about my people to pray to God?</P>

<P>It joyes my heart to hear these gracious breathings of Gods Spirit in you. I taste in your discourse evident tokens of a living childe of God. I see that my judgement about the spiri|tual state of your soul, was not a product of precipitate charity, but an effect of the spirit of right discerning. I will encourage you in your godly purposes, with a modest application of some of the Angels words to <HI>Gideon,</HI> Judg 6.12, 14. <HI>Go on, thou mighty man of valour, and go in this thy strength, and thou shalt save thy people. The Lord will be with thee.</HI> But for the manner of your proceed|ing in this matter, my thoughts incline me to propose this way: Be open to own the grace of God bestowed on you, to confess your former known crooked and dark wayes, and the change which God by his grace hath wrought in you. At present, let your first mo|tion be to stay a while at <HI>Natik,</HI> adjoyn your self to the Church, who when they hear your Confession, will joyfully receive you. In due season, request of the Church to send some able, pious, and fitting Teachers with you, among your people. Prudent Counsel may be taken how to prepare and predispose your people for such a motion. I do not doubt but the Governour and Magistrates of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> will be easily intreated to interpose in so good a work, which may tend to the bringing in so many people to the service of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>I do well approve and accept of your Counsel, it sa|voureth of discretion and wisdome, in all things God hath guided your lips to drop like the honey-comb into my heart. And now I have one request further unto you, That while we are together in this solitary opportunity, we may spend some time in conversing with God in Prayer, turn all those things that have passed into Prayers, and the future matters also; let us spread them before the Lord, and beg his guidance and blessing.</P>

<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do greatly accept this motion; and it is another sign of the truth of the work of Gods grace in your heart, because this is the property of the new creature, a new-born babe, that he will cry <HI>Abba Father.</HI> Here we leave them at Prayer.</P>
