<DIV2 TYPE="instructions of lottery">
<P>THIS Lottery is set on foot by a Resolution of Congress passed at Philadelphia, the 18th day of November, 1776, for the purpose of raising a sum of money <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> loan, bearing an annual interest of <HI>four per cent,</HI> which, with the sum arising from the deduction, is to be applied for carrying on the present most just and necessary war in defence of the lives, liberties and property, of the inhabitants of these United States.</P>
<P>The fortunate adventurers in the first class, and so in the second and third, who draw more than thirty or forty dollars shall, at their option, receive a Treasury Bank Note for the prize or prizes drawn, payable at the end of five years, and an annual interest at the rate of <HI>four per cent.</HI> for the pre|emption of such tickets, in the next succeeding class, as shall not be renewed within the time limited.</P>
<P>Every adventurer in the first class shall have a right to go through the subsequent classes, but shall not be obliged to do it.</P>
<P>The drawers of twenty, thirty, and forty dollars, in the first, second, and third classes, who do not apply for their money within six weeks after the drawing is finished, shall be deemed adventurers in the next succeeding class, and have their tickets renewed, without any farther trouble.</P>
<P>If any other shall neglect or decline taking out and paying the price of their ticket for a subsequent class, within six weeks after the drawing is ended, their tickets shall be sold to the fortunate adventurers in the preceding class, or to such as shall apply for the same.</P>
<P>The fortunate adventurers in the last class, who draw fifty dollars shall, upon application to the Commissioners of the loan offices; in the respective states, where the drawers reside, receive their money without any deduction; and all who draw above fifty dollars, shall receive in like manner, with|out deduction, for the sums drawn, treasury bank notes, payable at the end of five years after the drawing, at the loan office of the state in which the drawers reside. The in|terest to commence from the last day of drawing, and to be paid annually at the said respective loan offices.</P>
<P>As this lottery is established for the sole purpose of raising a sum of money for carrying on the present just war, under|taken in defence of the rights and liberties of America, in which every individual and posterity will be so deeply in|terested, it is not doubted but every real friend to his coun|try will most cheerfully become an adventurer, and that the sale of the tickets will be very rapid, especially as even <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">he unsuccessful adventurer will have the pleasing reflection of having contributed, in a degree, to the great and glorious American cause.</P>
<P>The managers appointed by Congress are Sharp Delany, John Purviance, Owen Biddle, David Jackson, Jacob Barge, Jonathan B. Smith, and James Searle, who are upon oath, and give bond for the faithful discharge of their trust.</P>
<P>The drawing of the first class will begin at Philadelphia, the 10th day of April next, or sooner, if sooner full.</P>
<P>The managers are instructed to sell the tickets for ready money only. Philad. Dec. 6, 1776.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="resolution">
<HEAD>In CONGRESS, November 27, 1776.</HEAD>
<P>Resolved, That it be recommended to the legislatures of the United States respectively, to pass such laws as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> most effectually tend to prevent the COUNTERFEITING or FORGING the TICKETS of the public lottery.</P>
