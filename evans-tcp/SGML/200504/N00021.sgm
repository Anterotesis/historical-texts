<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is warranted, and grounded upon the light both of nature and Scripture, <HI>2 Cor: 12.14.</HI> That Parents should lay up for their Chil|dren, and leave such an estate behind them, that their posterity after them may comfortably bee provided for, which as it is requisite for the outward subsistence of Children in temporal regards: So it is most necessary for spiritual Fathers (which the word of God tells are not many, <HI>1 Cor: 4.15.</HI> how many Instructours soever there are) I mean for the faithfull Ministers of Christ, to leave a good stock &amp; heritage of Gods Testimonyes for his people commit|ted to their charge, and their children in the faith: which care as it was alwayes needfull so especially it is in these times, wherin there is so much Apostacy &amp; de|parting away from the faith &amp; truth. In this regard we find it to have been the practise of the most precious servants of the Lord, that in their old age they have left their <HI>cygneas cantiones,</HI> their swans songs (as they are called) which they sung not long before they departed this life, as Moses did <HI>Deut: 32.</HI> the occasion of which song is set down <HI>Deut: 31.27, 29. I know your rebellion and your stiff neck: be|hold while I am yet alive with you, ye have been rebellious against the Lord, &amp; how much more after my death? and ver: 29. I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt your selves, and turn aside from the way that I Com|manded you, and evill will befall you in the latter dayes, because ye will do evill in the sight of the Lord &amp;c:</HI> Therefore ver: <HI>26. Moses commanded the Levites to take the book, and to put it in the side of the Arke of the Co|venant, for a witness against them upon any apostacy of theirs.</HI> And is there not as great need that such like course should be taken by Gods faithfull servants and Ministers to leave some workes as it were in the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke of the Covenant, some monuments &amp; witnesses against the backsliders in these dayes? Much like to this is the example of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shua before his death, as appeares <HI>Josh. chap: 23, and 24.</HI> wherein he warnes them against their apostacy most sweetly &amp; pathetically, and particularly remarkeable is that Josh. <HI>24., 25, 26. Joshua made a Covenant with the people, and set them a statute, and Ordinance in Sechem, and Joshua wrote those words in the book of the Law of God, and took a great stone, and set it there under an Oak that was by the Sanctuary of the Lord, and said unto all the people, behold this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he spake unto us, least ye deny your God.</HI></P>

Many of the Lords living witnesses are either killed or deceased and taken up to heaven, and those few that are surviving have very nigh finished their Testimony, and are following the others apace: There|fore it is very precious &amp; desirable, if as many of them as may be, when they can no longer testifie <HI>viv&acirc; voce,</HI> with a lively voyce, they may do it <HI>mortu&acirc;,</HI> or with a dead voyce, (or by writing) which is many times effectual and of great use: as it was the speech of that wise King <HI>Alphonsus,</HI> mortuos esse consulendos, ab ijs qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rendam veritatem, optimos&abque; eos esse consiliarios, that is <HI>that we should ask counsel of the dead, meaning the books of wise and good men departed) and that the truth is to be sought of them, and that they are the best counsellours</HI>: and be|fore him <HI>Demetrius Phalereus</HI> in Plutarch wisely admonished <HI>Ptolomeus Philadel|phus,</HI> the great Patron of learning, and the learned men of that age, ut demortuorum sapientum libros sibi compararet, quod quae aliquando consiliarij neque libere admo|nere metu paenae vellent, aut etiam sine periculo aliquo non auderent, de illis in libris eorum abunde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et libere scriptum essa. That is, <HI>that he should get the books of learned men departed, that of those things which sometimes his counsello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s nei|ther freely would admonish him for fear of punishment, or perhaps w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hout some danger durst not, I say of those things it was plentifully &amp; freely w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tten in their books.</HI> So we can not tell how neer such times may be, wherin neither friends nor ministers either will or dare make known unto us the blessed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of God: in such times doubtless godly books will speak freely to us, yea in whatsoever times that saying is most true, nullus amicus est magis liber quam liber, <HI>no freind is more free then a book is.</HI>  Finally I co~mend unto thy piety &amp; practise Christian Reader, this pious treatise of this Reverend &amp; judicious servant of the Lord, to which (at the request of a friend, in sincere respect of the Authour, &amp; just estimation of the work) I have prefixed a short preface, as the paper would permit; now&punc; I shall conclude un|doubtedly with that speech of our Saviour <HI>Joh. 13.</HI> if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them, so I co~mend both thy knowledg &amp; pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct thereof to the grace of God in Christ.</P>

Now if there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> sin in you, shall there not be grief &amp; sorrow because of the same?

Never say you love the blessed God, if it be so with you; If your sin which is such a dishon|our and injury and grief to him, be not a grief to you also. If you be of those that must be saved by Christ, then it was for your sins&punc; as well as for the sins of others that Christ was Crucified, and put to endure all those dolefull &amp; bitter sufferings in the garden, and upon the Cross, <HI>Mat</HI> 26, &amp; 27.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Think it not enough to serve the Lord your selves alone in your own per|sons, but be sure to have special care that your Children &amp; families may serve him also,</HI> and therefore remember to Instruct them and teach them the word and will of God, and to pray for them and with them, for Gods blessing to be upon their soules. For the former of these, there is express Co~mandement &amp; charge, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.5, 6. <HI>Pro.</HI> 22.6. <HI>Deut:</HI> 6.6, 7. In which last Scripture, every housholder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Commanded of God to have <HI>the words of God in his heart, and that he teach them diligently to his children, talking of them when he sitteth in his house, and when he walketh by the way, when he lyeth down &amp; when he riseth up.</HI> And therefore, if your children &amp; servants be not instructed &amp; taught in the word of God, you will not be able to give any good answer for it before the Lord, having lived in the neglect of so express &amp; plain, so serious and solemn a Commandement. The truth is you have but little love either to God, or to your children, or to your selves, if you make not conscience of this duty. For love to God would both provoke <HI>to keep his Commandements,</HI> of which the teaching of your children is one, and would stirr up the soul that hath it to de|sire &amp; endeavour that God might be honoured &amp; served as much &amp; by as many persons &amp; people as possibly it could attain unto. And therefore how can you say that you love God, when you do not your best endeavour that others, at least your own children &amp; housholds may do him service? Would you have God to have no service but by your selves, or whilest your selves are alive? You know your selves must not live alwayes; therefore it would be some Testimony of your love to his Majesty, if you be carefull to train up a poste|rity for the Lord, and so to teach them in his wayes, that your seed may serve him when your selves shall be dead &amp; gone. As for your children, you know they are born in sin, and so children of wrath by nature&punc; and without Rege|neration &amp; holiness must never see the Kingdom of God; and can you love them, and not endeavour to help them out of this woefull &amp; wretched con|dition? I think he loves his child, or his freind but little, that seeth him ly fast asleep within the flood-markes &amp; reach of the tide, and so every hour in danger to be swept away &amp; drowned in the waters and waves of the Sea, and
<PB N="10" REF="000047_0013_0F9F18914DDF0E50">
for all this can endure yet to let him alone, and never endeavour to awake him and rouse him up, that he may escape that apparent &amp; imminent danger. Judg then in your selves, what love there can be in you to your poor children when you take no care, or make no conscience to save their soules from the deluge of destruction, and from their sins of heart &amp; life, whereby they are in dayly danger to be swept away with that deluge, &amp; to be overwhelmed with destruction. Please not your selves as if you loved them sufficiently in that you are carefull to provide them meat &amp; cloaths, and other necessaryes for the body. For Turks &amp; Indians can do so; and should not you <HI>be better</HI> and do <HI>better then they?</HI> Will you do no more for the soules of your children then Pagans &amp; Infidels would do for the soules of theirs? Very beares and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uit beasts, yea and <HI>the Sea-monsters,</HI> are not so unnatural, but that they have some care of their young ones, <HI>Lam:</HI> 4.3. Only this care of theirs reacheth no further but to the flesh or body, as indeed they have no immortal Soules to care or be cared for. But I beseech you, let your care &amp; love to your children reach further, even to do your utmost endeavour to help forward the salvation of their precious and immortal soules; else never say you do truely love them. Nay in such case you cannot say you do truely love your selves. For the neglect of this duty will be your own disadvantage, and will further your own dis|comfort, both in this &amp; in another world. If children be duely instructed when they are young, there is hope they will walk according thereto when they shall be grown, <HI>Pro:</HI> 22.6. and will not this be a comfort &amp; joy of heart to any godly Parent? the holy Ghost tells us that <HI>the wise Son maketh a glad Father, Pro.</HI> 10.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 23. <HI>ver.</HI> 24, 25. <HI>&amp; ver.</HI> 15, 16.

Unless therefore you love your own sorrow &amp; shame, you must not leave your childre~ to them|seves, neglecting to instrust them in the word &amp; wayes of God, but as you love your selves &amp; your own comfort, you must be carefull of this duty; for this meanes is conducible to such an end, and the neglect hereof, doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end to the contrary. Consider seriously of this one thing, <HI>viz</HI> when poor children shall be plagued &amp; damned in Hell for their sin, and the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ace, and when the Parents also shall be in the same conditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n as for their other sins, so for this amongst the rest, that they have neglected this duty to their children, and dyed without Repentance for it, what a miserable &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day will that be? what a hearing will it be to poor tormented soules to hear their children cry out against them thus, or to the like purpose, viz

All this is no more then may well be imagined &amp; supposed to be the woefull condition of many poor children &amp; their Parents, in another world. And if all this seem a light thing in the eyes of any Pa|rent or housholder, I may say, the Lord be mercifull to such a man, for his heart is very hard. Joshua was otherwise minded, for he is resolute that <HI>he and his house will serve the Lord, Josh.</HI> 24.15. and David giveth grave and godly In|structions to his Son Solomon 1. <HI>Chron:</HI> 28.9. that he should <HI>know &amp; serve the Lord,</HI> and so <HI>Pro.</HI> 4.3, 4, 5.

Yea our Saviour tells us, that those that are <HI>the children of Abraham, will do the works of Abraham, John</HI> 8.39 Therfore as ever you desire to be known unto your selves or others to be the children of Abraham by a true &amp; lively faith, so see that you be carefull to tread in his steps and to do his workes, as in other things wherin he is propounded as a pat|tern, so in this particular of instructing &amp; well ordering of your children &amp; fa|milies. But alas, all your instructing will avail nothing, unless God do give the blessing; and therefore you must also be diligent and faithfull in the practise of prayer for &amp; with your families.

Oh therefore take heed, I do beseech you, least it be so with any of you, least earthly cares and encumbrances should dull your spirits, and take off their edge in the things of greatest importance, and lest by these things all the vigour of Religion should be wasted and worne out, and nothing be left but a dry &amp; sapless formallity, a spiritless &amp; powerless profession. You would be more happy if you could make a vertue of necessity, I mean if you could turn all the acts of your particular callings, all the imployments that God hath laid upo~ you about these earthly things, if you could turn them all into so many acts of Religion and Obedience towards God. Which is not a thing impossible, for the Apostle expressly requires it of Servants, that what ever they did (<HI>viz:</HI> in the labours of their callings) they should <HI>do it as unto Christ, as to the Lord and not unto men, Eph.</HI> 6.5, 6 7. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.22, 23. And if servants may do their works and dutyes of their places with such a spirit, why may not masters do theirs with the like spirit, and Parents theirs, and children theirs, and husband &amp; wives theirs, and every man &amp; euery woman perform their earthly imployments in such fear of God, in such singleness of heart, in such respect to the Co~mandement, that all these may be so many several acts of O|bedience towards God, so many parts &amp; expressions of the power &amp; practise of godliness? If Adam had not sinned, his <HI>dressing &amp; keeping the garden Gen:</HI> 2.15. would have been so: and doubtless with our blessed Saviour it was so; for he was <HI>subject</HI> to Joseph &amp; Mary as a child to his parents, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.51. and it is like he wrought with Joseph at the work of a Carpenter, and therfore he was not only called the Carpenters son, but <HI>the Carpenter Mark</HI> 6.3. and his Religious &amp; pious spirit would doubtless do all these external and earthly business with respect to God and in obedience to him. And the truth is, it is not only the object about which actions are conversant, but the heart wherewith they are done, and the grounds of doing them, with the ends that are aimed at therein, that makes them acts of Religion truly pleasing to God; So that if these be not right and spiritual, then preaching &amp; praying, hearing &amp; repeating Sermons, &amp; such like will be no better then acts of pro|faneness &amp; ungodlyness, and in the issue be charged upon the doers as so many

But on the contrary, civill imployments if they be performed with spiritual minds, upon such spiritual grounds, and to such spiritual ends as they might and ought, then these imployments even these will be accounted &amp; approv|ed of, as acts of religion &amp; godlyness, or obedience towards God, and as such will be pleasing in his sight. Wherefore, to make an end of this, let it be your care, and the Lord help you that you may do it effectually, that earthly or worldly imployments may not destroy nor diminish the life and power of godlyness &amp; religion, but that the life &amp; power of religion may breath and be put forth in all your earthly &amp; civil imployments.</P>

It seemes their fasting was neither with hearts that desired nor aimed to honour God, nor to enioy commu|nion with God, and therefore all their fasting is rejected, because God was not sought therein. If you do not seek the Lord in your doings and per|formances, nor make him the end of your desires &amp; endeavours, but that there be something else that your hearts do more esteem then him, and can rest contented withall, though without him, then I must needs say your state in grace is very questionable, or rather unquestionably unsound. For <HI>if any man love the world,</HI> (sure if he love the same better then God) <HI>the love of the Father is not in him,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.15. It is (and must needs be so accounted, even) a vile dishonour &amp; notorious contempt against the alsufficient and blessed God, when any creature whether a mans self, or ought else is more re|spected and esteemed then he. Therefore though <HI>many say, who will shew us any good,</HI> yet let your hearts say, <HI>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance up|on us, and this</HI> shall be to us <HI>more gladnes of heart, then in the time when their corn and their wine increased, Psal.</HI> 4.6, 7.

But it is as true, that this life can not now be had but through Christ, so that <HI>he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.12 If you desire Communion with God and shall sue unto him that you may enjoy it, (and you are most wretched &amp; accursed if you do it not) yet in such case the Lord will speak to you in language like to that of the Lord of Egypt unto Jacobs sonns, <HI>never see my face except your brother be with you,</HI> never look to see the face of God to your comfort in this or in another world, except Jesus Christ be with you, and that you present your selves before God in his Satis|faction &amp; Mediation. You may not think, oh let such thoughts be far from you, that you can have access to God or be accepted of him, for any thing that you have wrought or can work. You know but little of your selves if you do not know, that the best of your performances have need of pardon through the blood of Christ, and therefore they are not able to purchase any pardon or favour for you in the sight of God; no, no, it is Christ alone that must do this for you&punc; you and your works must be washed in his precious blood, and so cleansed from the uncleaness that is in you &amp; them, or else both you &amp; they will be rejected of God as most abominable in his sight. It is Christ alone that is the true High Priest that <HI>beares the iniquity of the holy things</HI> of Gods people, that through his Holiness <HI>they may be accepted before the Lord&punc; Exod:</HI> 28.38. which otherwise they could not be. It is he that is that true <HI>Golden Altar</HI> that <HI>Sanctifies</HI> all <HI>gifts,</HI> that are offered upon him. It is he that <HI>offers Incense with the prayers of all Saints,</HI> and perfumes them with his Merits and Intercession, that so they may ascend with acceptance before God <HI>out of his hand, Rev:</HI> 8.3, 4. Wherefore of necessity you must disclaim all thought of any worth in your selves, or in the best of your doings, and look for all acceptance of your persons &amp; performances through Jesus Christ and through him alone, as that blessed Martyr <HI>John Lambert</HI> cryed out at his death, <HI>none but Christ, none but Christ.</HI> When Christ was in the world he was allwayes carefull to honour the Father, &amp; now the Father would have all men to <HI>honour him, even as they honour the Father</HI>; and we are plainly told, that <HI>he that honour|eth not the Son, he honoureth not the Father which sent him, John.</HI> 5.23. And of the honour that we should do unto the Son, this is the Summ, that we ac|knowledg all our interest in God, and so in all good to be only through him and accordingly through him alone to look for it, and to behave our selves as those that so do. If you shall through grace do thus, this will be greatly for the honour of Jesus Christ, wherein you have a notable &amp; pregnant example of blessed Paul, as having gone before you in this way of giving honour to the Lord Jesus.
