<P>In h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t such as have been near to God, and he near to them, have complained of their being forsaken by God.

<P>What God hath inflicted on such, may be in|flicted on such again&punc; what God hath done to some, he may do to oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs&punc; in the same state, and relation: for he is unchangeable. Those that were once the only peculiar people of God, near to God, and had God near to them, yet what is is their condition at this day?

God hath been angry with them, and forsaken them, as they were foretold long ago. How is it with the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> that were once famous golden Candlesticks? that had E|pistles written to them. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e they not in a for|saken condition? not the face of a Church to be found amongst them.</P>

which may deserve a forsaking, they may through the corruption and unbelief of their hearts for|sake God, and God may injust judgement reta|liate, and thereupon forsake them. This is spo|ken to in the forequoted place, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.16, 17. <HI>They will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them: then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will for|sake them, and hide my face from them.</HI> So again, 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>But if you forsake him he will for|sake you</HI>; the first is supposed, <HI>if you forsake him,</HI> the latter is imposed, <HI>he will forsake you</HI>&punc;</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"> But why doth the Lord forsake such a People? The Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew that he hath no need of any, he hath forsaken many, and may forsake many more, to shew that he hath no need of any. God would have all the world to take notice, (that though all men have need of him, yet) he hath no need of any man.</P>
<P N="2">2. To testifie his Sanctity, and severity against sin. He will not spare them, that have been near him, if they will not spare their sin for him. He is a holy God, and if they will have their sins, and their lusts, and their wayes and their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, he will vindicate his holiness, by infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting this judgement on them.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be a war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to all that enjoy his gra|cious presence. That they see that they make much of it, and that they take heed that they
<PB N="9" REF="000330_0013_0FA4AD66FB1AFF28">
do not sin against him, and forsake him, and pro|voke him to forsake them also.</P>
<P><HI>Cant.</HI> The point is to be understood of a peo|ple that are visibly and externally near and dear to him, and these may be totally and finally for|saken of God: and yet here it must be noted, that God may exercise a deal of patience, and forbearance toward such as he is about to forsake, he did so with the old world, he did so with the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, he did so with the seven Chur|ches of <HI>Asia</HI>: he is not wont suddenly, and at once to forsake a people, that have been near and dear to him; but he is wont to give them warn|ing, and in patience to bear a while with their frowardness, and wait to see if there be any re|turning to him, before he doth inflict this heavy and sharp judgement.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> It serves to admonish us, not to bear our selves too high, upon the account of priviledges. It is a great priviledge to have the Lord near us, and to be near unto him: and some lean upon this though they abide in their sin, <HI>Micah</HI> 3.10, 11. <HI>They build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with ini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uity, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord amongst us?</HI> But if our de|portment be not according to our priviledges, if we do not carry it thereafter, by becoming an humble, fruitful, and holy people; the Lord will bring forth this heavy burden against us, we shall be rejected, and forsaken of the Lord, what|ever
<PB N="10" REF="000330_0014_0FA4AD67AA7B9858">
our external priviledges be.</P>
<P>But the second part of the Doctrine; or the second Doctrine may be now spoken to, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it is the heaviest burden, or the sorest of Judgements for the Lord to forsake a people.</HI></P>
<P>There may be two things spoken t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the ma|nagement of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruth. 1. Arguments to e|vidence it. 2. The Uses of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God hath threatned it as a very sore judgement, then sure it is so. Now when God hath been angry with a people, he hath manifest|ed the same by menac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng them with his forsaking them: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n he hath been designed to do them a deep displeasure, upon the account of some high provocation he is won to threaten them not by taking away this, or that outward comfort from them, but by taking away himself from them.</P>
<P>And that is a woe indeed, a woe with a witness, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.12. Yea, woe also to them, when I depart from them: this is the wofullest day that such a people are wont to meet with.</P>

There is no Protection to a People, whom the Lord forsake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but they are perplexed on every side.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because the evils that are on such, whom God hath forsaken&punc; they are only evils. The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> sometime hath the expression, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 7.5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, an evil, an only evil behold is come.</HI> This is such an evil, an only evil to a people. An evil whilst God is present, may have much good in it, the Lord may sancti|fie it for abundance of blessing: there is hopes of this whilst the Lord continues amongst them; but if he be gone, it is an only evil, and the evils that come upon them are such, they have no|thing but evil in them.</P>

<P N="5">5. It appears to be a sore judgement, by the an|guish and distress, that such have been in, that have been sensible that God hath forsaken them. Sin hath flown in the face of such, and terified them: Oh the blessed God is gone, and if he is gone, mercy is gone; and Oh for such and such sins, that lie upon me! what shall I do? what a moan have Saints themselves made in such a case? as <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 22.1.2. <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me? and from the words of my roaring? Oh my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent.</HI> Oh how <HI>Saul</HI> roared out his distress! and that on this account especially, that God was departed from him, not so much that the <HI>Philistines</HI> were upon him, had not God been gone, he could have dealt well enough with them; but here was the misery, and the sting of the misery, <HI>God was de|parted from him.</HI></P>
