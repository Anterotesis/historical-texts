<HEAD>TO ALL Ignorant People That desire to be <HI>INSTRVCTED.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>POor People, your manner is to sooth up your selves, as though you were in a most happy estate: but if the matter come to a just tryal, it will fall out far otherwise. For you lead your lives in great ignorance, as may appear by these your common opinions which follow.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That Faith is a mans good meaning and his good serving of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God is served by the rehear|sing of the ten Commandments, the Lords Prayer, and the Creed.</P>
<P N="3">3. That ye have believed in Christ ever since you could remember.</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is pity that he should live which doth any whit doubt of his salva|tion.</P>
<P N="5">5. That none can tell whether he shall be saved or not certainly; but that all men must be of a good belief.</P>
<P N="6">6. That howsoever a man live, yet if he call upon God on his death-bed, and
<PB REF="000328_0003_0FA4AA782A4F0E00">
say, <HI>Lord have mercy upon me,</HI> and so go away like a lamb, he is certainly saved</P>
<P N="7">7. That if any be strangely visited, he is either taken with a Planet, or bewit|ched.</P>
<P N="8">8. That a man may lawfully swear when he speaketh nothing but the truth, and swears by nothing, but that which is good, as by his faith and troth.</P>
<P N="9">9. That a Preacher is a good man no longer then he is in the Pulpit; <HI>They think all like themselves.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. That a man may repent, when he will, because the Scripture saith, <HI>At what time soever a sinner doth repent him of his sin, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. That it is an easier thing to please God, then to please our neighbour.</P>
<P N="12">12. That ye can keep the Command|ments as well as God will give you leave.</P>
<P N="13">13. That it is safest to do in religion as most do.</P>
<P N="14">14. That merry Ballads and Books, as <HI>Skoggin, Bevis of Southampton,</HI> &amp;c. are good to drive away the time, and to re|move heart qualms.</P>
<P N="15">15. That ye can serve God with all your hearts; and that you would be sorry else</P>
<P N="16"><PB REF="000328_0004_0FA4AA78F9253A08">16. That a man need not hear so many Sermons, except he could follow them better.</P>
<P N="17">17. That a man, which cometh at no Sermons, may as well believe, as he which hears all the Sermons in the world.</P>
<P N="18">18. That ye know all the Preacher can tell you: for he can say nothing, but that every man is a sinner, that we must love our neighbour as ovr selves, that every man must be saved by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.</P>
<P N="19">19. That it was a good world, when the old Religion was, because all things were cheap.</P>
<P N="20">20. That drinking and bezeling in the Ale-house or Tavern, is good fellowship, and shews a good kind nature, and main|tains neighbour-hood.</P>
<P N="21">21. That a man may swear by the Mass, because it is nothing now: and by our Lady, because she is gone out of the countrey.</P>
<P N="22">22. That every man must be for him|self, and God for us all.</P>
<P N="23">23. That a man may make of his own whatsoever he can.</P>
<P N="24">24. That if a man remember to say
<PB REF="000328_0005_0FA4AA79C45C12D8">
his prayers every morning (though he never understand them) he hath blessed himself for all the day following.</P>
<P N="25">25. That a man prayeth, when he saith the ten Commandments.</P>
<P N="26">26. That a man eats his Maker in the Sacrament.</P>
<P N="27">27. That if a man be no Adulterer, no Thief, no Murderer, and do no man harm, he is a right honest man.</P>
<P N="28">28. That a man need not have any knowledge of Religion, because he is not book-learned.</P>
<P N="29">29. That one may have a good mean|ing, when he saith and doth that which is evil.</P>
<P N="30">30. That a man may go to Wizards called wise men, for counsel: because God hath provided a salve for every sore.</P>
<P N="31">31. That ye are to be excused in all your doings, because the best men are sinners.</P>
<P N="32">32. That ye have so strong a Faith in Christ, that no evil company can hurt you.</P>
<P><HI>These and such like sayings, what argue they, but your gross ignorance? now where
<PB REF="000328_0006_0FA4AA7BF4C02680">
ignorance raigneth, there raigns sin, and where sin raigns, there the devil rules; and where he rules, men are in a damnable case. Ye will reply unto me thus: that ye are not so bad as I would make you. If need be, you can say the Creed, the Lords Prayer and the ten Commandments: and there|fore ye will be of Gods belief, say all men what they will, and you defie the Devil from your hearts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I answer again, that it is not sufficient to say all these without book, unless ye can understand the meaning of the words, and be able to make a right use of the Command|ments, of the Creed, of the Lords-Prayer; by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your lives and conversations. This is the very point in which ye fail.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And for an help in this your ignorance to bring you to true knowledge, unfeigned Faith and sound Repentance, here I have set down the principal points of Christian Re|ligion in six plain and easie Rules, even such as the simplest may easily learn: and here|unto is adjoyned an Exposition of them word by word. If ye do want other good directions, then use this my labour for your good instruction. In reading of it, first learn
<PB REF="000328_0007_0FA4AA7CCCEBC128">
the six Principles: and when you have them without book, and the meaning of them withal, thtn learn the exposition also which being well conceived, and in some measure felt in the heart, ye shall be able to profit by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot; and the ordinary parts of the Catechisme, namely, the ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be un|derstood.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="exposition">
<HEAD>The first Principle Expounded.</HEAD>
<P>Question. WHat is God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> God is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> or spi|ritual substance,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">John 4.24</NOTE> most wise, most holy, eternal&punc; infinite.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do you perswade your self that there is a God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Besides the Testimony of the Scri|pture, plain reason will shew it.</P>
<P>Q. VVhat is one reason?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VVhen I consider <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">. 1.20 Act. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">4.17</NOTE> the wonderful frame of the world, me thinks the silly creatures, that be in it, could never make it neither could it make it self, and there|fore b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">sides all these the Maker of it must needs be God. Even as when a man comes into a strange country, and sees fair and sumptuous buildings, and yet finds no li|ving

creatures there besides birds and beasts, he will not imagine that either birds or beasts reared those buildings, but he presently conceives that some men either are or have been there.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What other reason have you?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Rom. 2.15 Gen. 3.8, 10 &amp; 12.24</NOTE> A man that commits any sin, as murther, fornication, adultery, blasphe|my, &amp;c. albeit he doth conceal the mat|ter&punc; (that no man living know of it) yet oftentimes he hath a griping in his con|science, and feels the very flashing of hell|fire, which is a strong reason to shew that there is a God, before whose Judge|ment seat he must answer for his fact.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How many Gods are there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 8.6</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> more but one.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How do you conceive this one God in your mind?</P>
<P><HI>A,</HI> Not <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Deut. 4.16 Amos 4.13</NOTE> by framing any image of him in my mind, (as ignorant folk do) that think him to be an old man sitting in heaven, but I conceive him by his pro|perties and works.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What be his chief properties?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> First he is <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Job 2.13</NOTE> <HI>most wise,</HI> understanding all things aright, and knowing the reason of them. Secondly, he is <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Isai. 6.3 Exo. 20.5.6</NOTE> <HI>most holy,</HI> which appeareth in that he is <HI>most just,</HI> and <HI>mer|ciful</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="000328_0021_0FA4AD3D146298F0">
unto his creatures. Thirdly, he is <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Isai. 41.4</NOTE> <HI>eternal,</HI> without either beginning, or end of dayes. Lastly, he is <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Psal. 139.12.</NOTE> <HI>infinite,</HI> both because he is present in all places, and because he is of power sufficient to do whatsoever he <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Job. 9.4</NOTE> <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What be the works of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Ier. 10.12 Psal. 33.6</NOTE> The creation of the world, and of every thing therein, and the preser|vation of them being created by his <HI>spe|cial providence.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 10.17</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How know you that God govern|eth every particular thing in the world by his <HI>special providence?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To omit the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.30 Prov. 16.13</NOTE> Scriptures, I see it by experience: <NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Lev. 26.26 Mat. 4.4</NOTE> Meat Drink, &amp; cloath|ing, being void of heat and life, could not preserve the life of man, unless there were a <HI>special providence</HI> of God to give vertue unto them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is this one God distinguished?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into the <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Joh. 5.7 Mat. 3.16, 17</NOTE> <HI>Father,</HI> which begetteth the Son; into the <HI>Son,</HI> who is begotten of the Father; into the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">John 15.26</NOTE> <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> who proceedeth from the Father and the Son.</P>

<HEAD>The second Principle Expounded.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Let us now come to our selves, and first tell me what the natural estate of man is?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="000328_0022_0FA4AD3DB6C13640"><HI>A.</HI> Every man by nature is <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.2 1 Tim. 5.6</NOTE> <HI>dead</HI> in sin, as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corps lieth rotting and stinking in the grave, having in him the seed of all sins.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is sin?</P>
<P>A. Any <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">1 John 3 Rom 7.4, 7 Gal 3.10</NOTE> breach of the law of God, if it be no more but the least want of that which the Law requireth.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How many sorts of sins are there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sin is <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Col. 3 Psal 51.5</NOTE> either the corruption of nature, or any evil actions, that proceed of it, as fruits thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In whom is the corruption of na|ture?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In all men, <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Rom 3.10</NOTE> none excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what part of man is it?</P>
<P>A. In every <NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Gen 6.5 1 Thess 5.23</NOTE> part both of body and soul, like as a leprosie, that runneth from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Shew me how every part of man is corrupted with sin?</P>
<P>A. First, in the <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">1 Cor 2.14 Rom 8.5</NOTE> mind, there is no|thing but ignorance and blindness con|cerning heavenly matters. Secondly, the <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Tit 1.15 Eph 4.18, 19 Isai 57.20</NOTE> conscience is defiled, being al|wayes either benummed with sin, or else turmoiled with inward accusations and terrors. Thirdly, the <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.13.</NOTE> will of man only
<PB N="16" REF="000328_0023_0FA4AD3E9EA035C0">

Fourthly, the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.24</NOTE> affections of the heart, as love, joy, hope, desire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are moved and stirred to that which is evil, to embrace it; and they are never stirred unto that which is good, unless it be, to eschew it. Lastly, the <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Rom 6.19</NOTE> members of the body are the in|struments and tools of the mind, for the execution of sin.</P>
<P>Q What be those evil actions, that are the fruits of this corruption?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Evil <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Gen. 6.5</NOTE> thoughts in the mind, which come either by a mans own conceiving, or by suggestion of the devil: <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Joh. 13.2 Act. 5.3</NOTE> evil mo|tions and lusts stirring in the heart: and from these arise evil words and deeds when any occasion is given.</P>
<P>Q. How cometh it to pass that all men are thus defiled with sin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.12 18, 19 Gen. 3.9</NOTE> <HI>Adams</HI> infidelity and disobe|dience, in eating the forbidden fruit even as we see great personages by treason do not only hurt themselves, but also stain their blood, and disgrace their posterity</P>

<P>A. This <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Heb. 2.14 Eph 1.2 2 Cor 4.4 Luk. 11.14</NOTE> <HI>bondage</HI> is, when a man is the slave of the devil; and hath him to reign in his heart as his god.</P>
<P>Q. How may a man know whether Satan be his god, or not?</P>
<P>A. He may know it by this; if he give obedience to him in his heart, and express it in his conversation.</P>
<P>Q. And how shall a man perceive this obedience?</P>
<P>A. If he <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Ioh. 8.44 1 Iohn 3.8</NOTE> take delight in the evil <HI>mo|tions</HI> that Satan puts in his heart, and doth fulfil the <HI>lusts</HI> of the devil.</P>

<HEAD>The third Principle Expounded.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If damnation be the reward of sin, then is a man of all creatures most mise|rable: A dog, or a toad, when they die, all their misery is ended; but when a man dieth, there is the beginning of his woe.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It were so indeed, if there were no means of deliverance, but God hath shewed his mercy in giving a <HI>Saviour</HI> to mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is this Saviour called?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Mat. 1.21</NOTE> Jesus Christ?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why must our Saviour be both God and Man?</P>
<P>A. He <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 2.5, 6</NOTE> must be a man, because ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter"> had sinned, and therefore a man must

die for sin, to appease Gods wrath: he must be God, to sustain and uphold the <HI>manhood,</HI> to overcome &amp; vanquish death.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What be the Offices of Christ, to make him an all sufficient Saviour?</P>
<P>A. He <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Psal. 45.7 Luk. 4.18 Deu 18.15, 18 Lu. 1.33 Psal. 110</NOTE> is a Priest, a Prophet, a King,</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why is he a Priest?</P>
<P>A: To work the means of salvation in the behalf of man kind.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth he work the means of Salvation?</P>
<P>A. <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mat 10.28 Heb 7..25, 26</NOTE> First, by making <HI>satisfaction</HI> to his Father for the sin of man: Secondly, by making <HI>intercession.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How doth he make satisfaction?</P>
<P>A. By two means: and the first is by offering a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the Sacrifice?</P>
<P>A. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Isai. 35.10</NOTE> Christ himself, as he is a man, con|sisting of body and soul.</P>

<P>A. Christ, as he is God, is the Altar on which he sacrificed himself.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who was the Priest?</P>
<P>A. None <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Heb. 5.5, 6</NOTE> but Christ, and that as he is both God and man.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How oft did he sacrifice himself?</P>
<P>A. Never but <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.28</NOTE> once.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What death did he suffer, when he
<PB N="20" REF="000328_0027_0FA4AD4241124EA8">
sacrificed himself?</P>
<P><HI>A. A</HI> death upon the Cross, peculiar to him alone; <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Isai. 53.5. Joh. 12.27 Rev. 19.15 Luk 22.44</NOTE> for besides the separa|tion of body and soul, he felt also the pangs of hell, in that the whole wrath of God due to the sin of man, was poured forth upon him.</P>
<P>Q. VVhat profit cometh by his sacri|fice?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Gods <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.26</NOTE> wrath is appeased by it.</P>
<P>Q. Could the sufferings of Christ, which were but for a short time, counter|vail everlasting damnation, and so ap|pease Gods wrath?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yea, for seeing Christ suffered, God <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Act. 20.28 2 Cor. 5.15</NOTE> suffered, though not in his Godhead: and that is more then if all the men in the world had suffered for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Q. Now tell me the other means of <HI>satisfaction</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the perfect <HI>fulfilling of the law</HI></P>
<P>Q. How did he fulfil the Law?</P>
<P><HI>A</HI> By his <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.30 Rom. 3.25 2 Cor. 5.21</NOTE> <HI>perfect righteousness,</HI> which consists of two parts: the first, the <HI>inte|grity</HI> and <HI>pureness</HI> of his humane nature: the other, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rom. 5.19 Rom. 4.1</NOTE> his <HI>obedience</HI> in performing all that the Law requireth.</P>

how doth he make <HI>intercession</HI>?</P>

<P>Q. Why is he also a King?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Isai. 9.7</NOTE> he might <HI>bountifully bestow</HI> upon us, and <HI>convey</HI> unto us all the afore|said means of salvation.</P>
