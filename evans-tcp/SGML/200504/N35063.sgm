<P>&mdash; Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the begining of this chapter John bears tes|timony, that Jesus is the Son of God. Verse 1st. In the begining was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. This is that Lamb of God which I now invite you to behold. My Brethren, we are to behold the Son of God as our Lord and giver of life&punc; for he was made flesh and dwelt among us, verse 14 of the context, and here he is declared to be the Son of God full of grace and truth. And here in the first place I mean to shew the necessity of behold|ing the Lamb of God in the sense of the text. 2d. Endeavour to shew when we are said to be|hold the Son of God in the sense of the text. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> I shall shew when we may be said not to behold the Lamb of God as we should do. In the 4th place I shall endeavor to shew how far we may be mistaken in beholding the Lamb of God. In the 5th place I shall endeavor to rectify these mistakes.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="045880_0004_102079E89F627450">My brethren, since I wrote my Winter Piece it hath been requested that I would write some|thing more for the advantage of my friends, by my superiors, gentlemen, whose judgment I de|pend on, and by my friends in general, I have had an invitation to give a public exhortation; but did not think it my duty at that time; but now, my brethren, by divine assistance, I shall endeavor to shew the necessity of beholding the Lamb of God. My brethren we must behold the Lamb of God as taking away the sin of the world, as in our text, and it is necessary that we behold the Lamb of God as our King: ah! as the King immortal, eternal, invisible, as the only Son of God, for he hath declared him, as in the 8th verse of the context, no man hath seen God at any time: The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. My brethren, let us strive to behold the Lamb of God, with faith and repentance; to come weary and heavy laden with our sin, for they have made us unworthy of the mercy of the Lamb of God; therefore, we see how necessary it is that we be|hold the Lamb of God, in the sense of the text, that is, in a spritual manner, not having on our own righteousness; but we must be cloathed up|on, with the unspotted robes of the Lamb of God; we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling, always abounding in the works of the Lord; we must remember the vows of our baptism, which is to follow the Lamb of God, John Chap. I.33. speaking of baptism, he saith, upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending
<PB N="4" REF="045880_0005_102079EA28F5C378">
and remaining on him, the same is he which bap|tiseth with the Holy Ghost, and verse 34, and I saw, and bare record, that this is the Son of God, verse 35, again the next day after, John stood and two of his disciples, verse 36, and looking upon Jesus, as he walked, and saith, behold the Lamb of God, verse 37, and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. Thus, my dear brethren, we are to follow the Lamb of God, at all times, whether in prosperity or ad|versity, knowing that all things work together for good, to them that love God, or as in Rom. viii.28. now let us manifest that we love God, by a holy life; let us strive to glorify and mag|nify the name of the most high God. It is ne|cessary that we behold the Lamb of God, by tak|ing heed to our ways, that we sin not with our tongues, Psalm xxxix.1. Here, my brethren, we have the exhortation of David, who beheld the Lamb of God with faith and love, for he crys out with a most humble petition, O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger; neither chastise me in thy hot displeasure. Psalm vi.1. and now, my brethren, have we not great reason to cry to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world, that he may have mercy on us and forgive us our sins, and that he would give us his holy spirit, that we may have such hungerings and thirsting as may be acceptable in the sight of God, for as the heart panteth for the water brook, so should our souls pant for the living God. Psalm xlii.1. and now, my brethren, we must behold the law of God, as is exprest, John I.51.
<PB N="5" REF="045880_0006_102079EBE6C82960">
And he saith unto him, verily, verily I say unto you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending up|on the Son of man. This is a representation of the great day, when the Lamb of God shall ap|pear. Matt. xxiv.30, and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. Here my brethren, we have life and death set before us, for if we mourn with the tribes for our sins, which have made us unworthy of the least favour in the sight of God, then he will have mercy and he will give us his holy spirit; then we shall have hearts to pray to the Lamb of God, as David did when he was made sensible of his im|perfections, then he cryed to the Lamb of God, have mercy upon me O God, Psal. lxi.1, ac|cording to thy loving kindness, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. This my brethren is the language of the penitent, for he hath a desire that his heart may be turned from darkness to light, from sin to holiness; this none can do but God; for the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can be. Here we see that we must behold the Lamb of God as calling to us in the most tender and compas|sionate manner, Matt. xxiii.37, saying, O Je|rusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have ga|thered thy children together, even as a hen ga|thereth
<PB N="6" REF="045880_0007_102079ED75F96200">
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. As much as if he had said, O ye wicked and rebellious people have I not given my word as a rule of life; have I not sent the ministers of the gospel to teach you, and you will not receive the doctrine of the gospel, which is faith and repentance, I tell you nay; but ex|cept ye repent ye shall all likewise perish, Luke xiii.4.</P>
<P>And now my dear brethren, have we repented of our sins? have we not neglected to attend divine service? Or if we have attended to the word of God, have we been sincere? For God is a spirit, and they that worship him must wor|ship him in spirit and truth, John iv.24. When we have heard the word of God sounding in our ears, inviting of us to behold the Lamb of God; O my dear brethren, have we as it were laid up these words in our hearts, or have we not been like the stony ground hearers? Matt. xii.20. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it. Ver. 21. Yet hath not root in himself, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. This is the effect of a hard heart. There is such a de|pravity in our natures that we are not willing to suffer any reproach that may be cast on us for the sake of our religion; this my brethren is because we have not the love of God shed abroad in our hearts; but our hearts are set too much
<PB N="7" REF="045880_0008_102079F2EEB34AB0">
on the pleasures of this life, forgetting that they are passing away; but the children of God are led by the spirit of God. Rom. viii.12, There|fore brethren we are debtors, not to the flesh to live after the flesh. Ver. 13, For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. Ver. 14, For as many are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Here my bre|thren we see that it is our indispensible duty to conform to the will of God in all things, not hav|ing our hearts set on the pleasures of this life; but we must prepare for death, our great and last change. For we are sinners by nature, and are adding thereunto by evil practices; for man is prone to evil as the sparks to fly upward; and there is nothing short of the divine power of the most high God can turn our hearts to see the liv|ing and true God; and now we ought to behold the Lamb of God, as it is expressed in Isaiah vii.14, A virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emanuel. This my brethren is the Son of God, who died to save us guilty sinners, and it is only by the mercy of the blessed Jesus we can be saved: Therefore, let us cast off self-dependence, and rely on a crucified Saviour, whose blood was shed for all that came unto him by faith and repentance; this we cannot do of ourselves, but we must be found in the use means; therefore we ought to come as David did, Psal. li.1, Have mercy on me O God, according to thy loving kindness. This my bre|thren
<PB N="8" REF="045880_0009_102079F47B569510">
is the duty of all flesh to come to the di|vine fountain, and to confess our sins before the most high God; for if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our transgressions. And now my bre|thren, seeing I have had an invitation to write something more to encourage my dear fellow ser|vants and brethren, Africans, in the knowledge of the Christian religion, I must beg your patience, for I mean to use the utmost brevity that so im|portant a subject will admit of; and now my brethren, we have, as I observed in the foregoing part of this discourse, life and death set before us, for we are invited to come and&punc; accept of Christ on the terms of the gospel. Isaiah xliv.1, O every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea, come ye buy wine and milk, with|out money and without price. Here is life, and if we search our hearts, and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord he will forgive us our sins and blot out our transgressions, Lamen. iii.40. But if we continue in our sins, having our hearts set on the pleasures of this life, forgetting that we must give an account for the deeds done in the body. Psal. lxii.12, Also unto the Lord belongeth mercy, for he rendereth to every man according to his works. Here we see that we should behold the Lamb of God by a holy life. Psal. vii.11, God judgeth the righteous and is angry with the wicked every day, ver. 12, if he
<PB N="9" REF="045880_0010_10207A10296E6E18">
turn not. He will whet his sword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready. Here we see that the wrath of God abideth on the unbelievers and unconverted sinner. And now my brethren, should not a sense of these things make us cry out in the apostle's language, 'Men and bre|thren what shall we do to be saved?' We must be found in the use of means, and pray that God would be pleased to rain down a rain of righte|ousness into our souls; then we shall behold the Lamb of God as taking away the sins of the world. Let us my brethren examine ourselves whether we have had a saving change wrought in our hearts, and have been brought to bow to the divine sovereignty of a crucified Saviour; have we been brought to behold the Lamb of God, by obeying the precepts of Isaiah, and turning from evil and learning to do well. Isaiah i.16, Wash ye, make you clean; put away the evil of your doing from before mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well. Here we have the admonition of the prophet Isaiah, who was inspired with the knowledge of divine things, so that he calls heaven and earth to witness against the wicked and rebellious sinner. Isaiah i.2, Here O hea|vens and give ear O earth; for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished up children, and they have rebelled against me. Is not this the case? Have we not been going astray like lost sheep? Luke xv.6, Have we not great reason to lay our hands on our mouths and our mouths in the dust, and come upon the bended knees of our
<PB N="10" REF="045880_0011_10207A11B1901470">
souls and beg for mercy as the publican did, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner, Luke viii.13. This my dear brethren should be the language of our conversation; to have a life void of offence towards God and towards man. Have we beheld the Lamb of God, by taking up our cross, denying ourselves, and following the blessed Jesus. Matt. xvi.24, Then said Jesus unto his disciples, if any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me. Here we see that we should behold the Lamb of God as our only Saviour and mighty Redeemer, and we are to take up our cross and follow the Lamb of God at all times, not to murmur at the hand of Divine Providence; and we have our example set before us, Luke xxii.41, 42, And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and he kneeled down and prayed, saying, my Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me, nevertheless not my will but thine be done. We should behold the Lamb of God as coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory, whom our heavenly Father hath declared to be his only Son. Matt. xvii.5, And while he yet spoke, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice out of the cloud which said, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him. Should not a sense of these things inflame our hearts with fear and love to God; knowing that there is no other name given by which we can be saved, but by the name of Jesus; let us
<PB N="11" REF="045880_0012_10207A15E1C13C40">
behold the Lamb of God as having power to make the blind to see, the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk, and even to raise the dead: But it may be objected and said by those that have had the advantage of studying, are we to expect miracles at this day? These things were done to confirm that Jesus was the Son of God, and to free us from the burthen of types and ce|remonies of the Jewish law; and this by way of instruction, which I desire to receive with an humble spirit. Others may object and say, what can we expect from an unlearned Ethiopian? And this by way of reflection. To this I answer, Pray Sir, give me leave to ask this question, Doth not the raising of Lazarus give us a sight of our sinful natures? John xi.12, 13, And when he had thus spoken, he said with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth. Ver. 4, And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his head was bound with a napkin; Jesus saith unto them, loose him and let him go. Is not this a simile of our deadness by nature? And there is nothing short of the power of the most high God can raise us to life. Sirs, I know we are not to expect miracles at this day; but hear the words of our Saviour Matt. xvi.16, And Simon Peter answered and said, thou art Christ the Son of the living God. Ver. 17, And Jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. Sirs, this may suf|fice
<PB N="12" REF="045880_0013_10207A17674ADA68">
to prove that it is by grace we are saved, and that not of ourselves, is the gift of God. But my brethren, for whom this discourse is de|signed, I am now in the second place to shew when we are said to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text: When we are brought humbly to confess our sins, before the most high God, and are calling on our souls and all that is within us to bless his holy name; this is the duty of all flesh, to praise God for his unmerited mercy in giving his Son to save lost man, who by the fall of Adam became guilty in the sight of God. Rom. v.8, But God commandeth his love towards us, in that while we were sinners Christ died for us. Here we are to behold the Lamb of God as suffering for our sins, and it is only by the precious blood of Christ we can be saved, when we are made sensible of our own imperfections and are desirous to love and fear God; this we cannot do of ourselves, for this is the work of God's holy spirit. John vi.64, And he said, therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my Father. Here we see to behold the Lamb of God, in the sense of the text, as the gift of God; we should come as David did, saying, O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy hot displeasure, Psal. v<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.1. And we should put our whole trust in the Lord at all times; we should strive to live a religious life, to avoid the very appearance of evil, least
<PB N="13" REF="045880_0014_10207A1A40B1C7B8">
we incur the wrath of God. Psal. xi.6, Upon the wicked he shall rain showers of fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup. Here we see the un|happy state of the sinner; for he is not only led away by that subtle adversary the devil, but he hath the word of God pronounced against him. Matt. xxv.40, Then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into ever|lasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Here my brethren we are to behold the Lamb of God as being crucified for us. Matt. xxiii.20, Pilate therefore willing to release Jesus spake again to them. ver. 22, But they cryed, saying crucify him, crucify him. Here we see the ef|fect of sin; the blood of Christ was shed for all that came unto him by faith and repentance. O my brethren, when those things have a proper influence on our minds, by the power of the most high God, to say as David did, Psal. ciii.1, Bless the Lord O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Then we may be said to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text: And we are to behold the Lamb of God as it is expressed in Matt. xvii.22, And while they abode in Ga|lillee Jesus said unto them, the Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of men; and ver. 23, And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And now should not a sense of these things have a tendency to make us hum|ble in the sight of God, and we should see the place and situation of Christ suffering. Luke xxii.
<PB N="14" REF="045880_0015_10207A1BDA439E18">
33, And when they were come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left. Here we see the boundless riches of free grace; he is numbered with trans|gressors, whose blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel; for the blood of Abel calls for justice on the sinner, but the blood of Christ calls for mercy. Luke xxiii.34, Then said Jesus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. Here we have the example of our Saviour, that we should forgive our enemies, and pray that God would forgive them also, or how shall we say the Lord's Prayer, 'Forgive us our tresspasses as we forgive them that tress|pass against us.' Now when we are enabled to do these things, as we should do them, then may we be said to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text. And now my dear brethren, I am to remind you of a most melancholy scene of Providence; it hath pleased the most high God, in his wise providence, to permit a cruel and un|natural war to be commenced; let us examine ourselves whether we have not been the cause of this heavy judgment; have we been truly thank|ful for mercies bestowed? And have we been humbled by afflictions? For neither mercies nor afflictions proceed from the dust, but they are the works of our heavenly Father; for it may be that when the tender mercies of God will not allure us, afflictions may drive us to the divine fountain. Let us now cast an eye back for a
<PB N="15" REF="045880_0016_10207A2003F6ADD0">
few years and consider how many hundreds of our nation and how many thousands of other na|tions have been sent out of time into a never-end|ing eternity, by the force of the cannon and by the point of the sword. Have we not great cause to think this is the just deserving of our sins; for this is the word of God. Isaiah iii.11, Wo unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him. Here we see that we ought to pray, that God may hasten the time when the people shall beat their swords into plough-shares and their spears into pruning hooks, and nations shall learn war no more.</P>
<P>And now my dear brethren have we not great reason to be thankful that God in the time of his judgments hath remembered mercy, so that we have the preaching of the gospel and the use of our bibles, which is the greatest of all mercies; and if after all these advantages we continue in our sins, have we not the greatest reason to fear the judgments of God will be fulfilled on us. He that being often reproved hardneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. Have we not great reason to praise God that he is giving us food and raiment, and to say as David did, Psal. cxxxvii.1, O give thanks unto the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever. And now my brethren, when these things make ua more humble and more holy, then we may be said to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text. And now, in the third
<PB N="16" REF="045880_0017_10207A242D6D16E0">
place, I am to shew when we may be said not to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text: When we are negligent to attend the word of God, and unnecessarily, or are living in any known sin, either of omission or commission, or when we have heard the word peached to us and have not improved that talent put into our hands by a holy life, then we may be said not to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text. And now my brethren, I am in the fourth place, to shew how in some things we may be mistaken in beholding the Lamb of God, while we are flattering ourselves with the hopes of salvation on the most slight foundation, because we live in a Christian land and attend to divine service; these things are good in them|selves; but there must be a saving change wrought in our hearts, and we must become a new in Christ Jesus; we must not live after the flesh, but after the spirit, for as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God, Rom. viii.14. and we are to pray that God would keep us from all evil, especially the evil of sin. Bishop Bevrage, in his second Resolution, speaking of sin, he says, "For as God is the centre of all good, so sin is the fountain of all evil in the world, all strife and contention, ignominy and disgrace." Read a little further, and he goes on to protest against sin, "I resolve to hate sin (says he) wherever I find it, whether in myself or in others, in the best of my friends as well as in the worst of my enemies." Here we see my brethren
<PB N="17" REF="045880_0018_10207A25C8EEA6D0">
that if we commit any willful sin, either of omis|sion or commission, we become the servants of sin, and are deceiving ourselves, for the apostle hath told us, that the wages of sin is death, Rom. vi.22, 23; but now being made free from sin, and are become the servants of God ye have your fruits into holiness, and in the end eternal life; for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord We are to behold the Lamb of God by reading the scriptures, and we must believe that he hath power to give everlasting life. John vi.47, Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life. Do we my brethren believe in the blessed Jesus as we ought? Are we not going the broad way to utter destruction? Are we not leaving the blessed Jesus, who hath the bread of life and is that bread? John vi.48, I am the bread of life. Here we see that the blessed Jesus hath power to give eternal life to all that come unto him by faith and repentance; and we see that he is calling to us as he did to his disciples, saying, Wilt thou go away also; for this is the language of the scriptures, John vi.67, 68, Then Simon answered him, Lord to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we are my brethren to behold the Lamb of God as being the door of eternal life, for this he hath declared in his word to us. John x.9, I am the door, by me if any man enter he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pas|ture.
<PB N="18" REF="045880_0019_10207A28A2162A70">
But it is very plain my brethren that if we come in our sins God will not hear us, but if we come and worship him in spirit and in truth he will have mercy on us. John ix.31, 32, Now we know that God heareth not sinners, but if any man be a worshipper of God and doth his will, him he neareth. My dear brethren as I am drawing to a conclusion, let me press on you to prepare for death, that great and irresist|able king of terrors, by a holy life, and make the word of God the rule of your life; but it may be objected we do not understand the word of God. Mr. Burkit, a great divine of our church says, in the scriptures there is depths that an elephant may swim, and shoals that a lamb may wade. Therefore we must take the plainest text as a key to us. And now my brethren I am in the fifth place to endeavour to rectify any mistake we may labour under, when we are tak|ing on us the form of Godliness, without the power thereof, then we cannot be said to behold the Lamb of God in the sense of the text. We must pray earnestly to God for his holy Spi|rit to guide us in the way to eternal life; this none can do but God. Let us my brethren lay up treasure in heaven, where neither moth doth corrupt nor thieves break through and steal. Matt. vi.20&mdash; 23, Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. And now my dear brethren, we must pray earnestly to God for the influence of his holy spirit to guide us through
<PB N="19" REF="045880_0020_10207A2B835E2308">
this howling wilderness and sea of trouble to the mansions of glory, and we should pray that God would give us grace to love and to fear him, for if we love God, black as we be, and despised as we are, God will love us. Acts x.34, Then Peter opened his mouth and said, of a truth I perceive that God has no respect to persons. Ver. 35, In every nation he that fear|eth him is accepted of him. Psalm. xxxiv.8, O taste and see that the Lord is good, and bles|sed is the man that trusteth in him. Ver. 15, The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. Let us my dear brethren remember that the time is hasten|ing when we shall appear before the Lamb of God to give an account for the deeds done in the body, when we shall be stumbling over the dark mountains of death looking into an endless eternity. O that we may be of that happy number that shall stand with their lamps burning. Matt. xxv.7, Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. Come now my brethren, let us examine ourselves whether we have had a saving change wrought in our hearts, and have been brought to bow to the divine sovereignty of the most high God, and to flee to the armies of Jesus, for he is the author of our peace, and the finisher of our faith. Heb. xii.2, Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. Come now my brethren, we are one flesh and bone, let us serve the one living and true God. Come let us behold the Lamb of God by an eye of faith,
<PB N="20" REF="045880_0021_10207A2E61A42EC0">
for without faith it is impossible to please God. Heb. xi.5, For faith my brethren is of the things not seen. Let us my brethren strive by the grace of God to become new creatures; for if any man be in Christ he is a new creature, 2. Cor. iv.17. Let us come to the divine fountain, by constant prayer. Psal. iv.1, Give ear to my words O Lord, consider my meditations, ver. 2, 3. Let us improve our talents by a holy life, striving to make our calling and election sure, for now is the accepted time; behold now is the day of salvation. 2. Cor. vi.2. Let us pray that God give us of the waters that the wo|man of Samaria drank. John xiv.19, But whosoever shall drink of the water I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. O my dear brethren we should be brought humbly to submit to the will of God at all times, and to say God be merciful to us sinners. Acts iii.19, Repent and be converted that your sins may be blotted out. My dear brethren we are many of us seeking for a temporal freedom, and I pray that God would grant your desire; if we are slaves it is by the permission of God; if we are free it must be by the power of the most high God; be not discouraged, but cheerfully perform the duties of the day, sensible that the same power that created the heavens and the earth and causeth the greater light to rule the day and the lesser to rule the night, can cause a universal freedom; and I pray God may give you grace to seek that freedom which tendeth to everlasting life. John viii.32, And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Ver. 36, If the Son shall make you free, then you shall be free indeed. But as I am advanced to the age of seventy-one years, I do not desire temporal freedom for myself. My brethren, if we desire to be a happy people, we must be a holy people, and endeavour to keep the commandments of God, and we should pray that God would come and knock at the door of our hearts by the power of his holy spirit, and give us a stedfastness in the merits of Christ, and we are to believe in Christ for eternal salvation. Mr. Stoddard, a great divine, says, in speaking of appearing

in the righteousness of Christ, when men believe it is part of God's covenant, to make them continue to believe. Job. vi.12. And again he saith, since God hath pro|mised life unto all that believe in this righteousness, it must needs be safe to appear before God in this righte|ousness. Jer. iii.22, Return ye back-sliding children and I will heal your your back-slidings; behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord our God. My dear bre|thren let not your hearts be set too much on the pleasures of this life; for if it were possible for one man to gain a thousand freedoms, and had not an interest in the me|rits of Christ, where must all the advantage be; for what would it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and loose his own soul, Matt. xvi.26. My brethren we know not how soon God may send the cold hand of death to summon us out of this life to a never-ending eternity, there to appear before the judgment seat of Christ. 2 Cor. v.10, For all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ. And now I conclude with a few words&mdash;let me tell you my dear brethren, that in a few days we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, there to give an account for the deeds done in the body. Let us my brethren strive to be so prepared for death, by the grace of God, that when the time shall come when we are shaking off the shackles of this life, and are passing through the valley of the shadow of death. O may we then be enabled to say, come Lord Jesus come quickly, for thou art the Lamb of God, in whom my soul delighteth: Then my dear brethren all those which have repented of their sins shall hear this voice, come un|to me. Matt. xxv.34, Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand; come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda|tion of the world. But if we do not repent of our sins we must hear this voice, Matt. xxv.41, Then shall he say also unto them on his left hand, depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Then will our souls waft away into an endless eternity, and our bodies lodged in the cold and silent grave, there to remain till Christ's second coming. My brethren, we believe the word of God, we must believe

this. 1 Cor. xiii.41, Behold I shew you a mistery, we shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised, ver. 35, For this corruptable must put on incorruption, and this mortals must put on immortality. And now my bre|thren, let me persuade you to seek the Lord. Isaiah lv.6, Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call on him while he is near; ver. 7, Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God and he will abundantly pardon. There|fore not be contented with the form of godliness without the power thereof. AMEN.</P>
