<HEAD>Order for listing Troopers.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHereas Complaints are made to this Court that several foot Companyes are discouraged and weakned, by frequent listing their best Souldiers into Troops, (whereby the Infantry reputed the chief strength of the Militia in any Country) are like to be very feeble, and this error arises from the misconstruing of a Law directing the listing of Troopers, which saith, that no person shall list unless he pay for one hundred pounds estate in a single Country rate, and be otherwayes well qualified. But the practise is different from the Law (as is conceived) for Con|stables giving Certificate that such a person payes in a single Country Rate eight shillings four pence, including therein heads of persons;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Order regu|lating listing of Troopers.</NOTE> <HI>and upon this Certificate the Captain of the Troop lysts the person Certified, and so as it is apprehended the Law is not attended.</HI> For prevention whereof,</P>
<P>It is Ordered that no Constable shall give Certificate to any person desi|ring to lyst a Trooper, unless the said person pay <HI>bona fide</HI> in a single Country Rate for one hundred pounds estate, without respect to poll money and also no such Foot Souldier shall lyst in any Troop, unless he have a Certificate from the Major of the Regiment under his hand, that he is a fit person and hath ob|teined the consent of the Commission Officers of the Foot Company whereun|to he belongs, or the major part of them, &amp;c.</P>

<P>It is Ordered by this Court, and the Authority thereof; that no persons whatsoever without the consent of the Freemen of the Town where they live,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penalty for erecting new Meeting hous|es without consent of Authority.</NOTE> first orderly had and obteined at a publick meeting assembled for that end, and license of the County Court: or in defect of such consent and license by the special order of the General Court, shall erect, or make use of any house as abovesaid.
