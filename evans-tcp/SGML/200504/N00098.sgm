<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SUndry Judicious and Learned (in both <HI>Englands</HI>) upon the perusal of the following <HI>Sermons,</HI> have professed that the <HI>Author</HI> hath therein done like him|self, and (according to the wisdome given unto him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God) comprehended in a little room, the Substance of what is to be said, in <HI>Defence</HI> of that <HI>Cause,</HI> which in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ast Age hath been so abundantly confirmed, both by Words and Sufferings of many of the Lords faithfull Servants. I have known some in that City where these <HI>Sermons</HI> were Preached, who although by reason of their adherence to <HI>Hierarchical Principles,</HI> they esteemed the Author as one of their greatest Opposites, yet would say of him, That for a Scriptural, Logical, Methodical Preacher, they never knew his equall.</P>
<P>It hath been the <HI>Fate</HI> (may we use that word) attending the Posthumous Works of many Learned men, that they have come forth with a <HI>Caetera desiderantur,</HI> as is to be seen in sundry of our great <HI>Rainold</HI> his Praelections <HI>de libr. Apocr.</HI> (not to mention others) And so it is here: Never|theless, this Copy is perfect so far as it goeth, having been, not onely perused by the <HI>Author</HI> himself, but a great part of it written with his own hand, (who saw cause to enlarge the <HI>Second Sermon</HI> especially, after it was Preached) from whom I received it some yeares ago, we being then both of us in the same Land; but we were con|strained


<PB REF="000151_0003_0FA2B7D8CBA80628">
to part, before he could cause all his Meditations and Collections on this Subject to be Transcribed. That defect notwithstanding, it hath been conceived, that if what is here presented, should be in this way brought into publick light, it would conduce very much towards the establishment of many in <HI>the present Truth,</HI> both in the Land where these Sermons were Preached, and amongst us also, who are <HI>Exiles</HI> for the same Cause, should any number of Copies (as after Printed, 'tis hoped there may) happen to be dispersed amongst us they are therefore Transmitted for the Press.</P>
<P>The most specious Reason, which our Opposites seem to have for the impleaded <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> is the <HI>pretended In|differency</HI> of them. Were that so, yet considering that the <HI>Imposition</HI> of them is attended with <HI>Scandal</HI> to many <HI>Pro|testants,</HI> who embrace these <HI>Superstitions</HI> with relucting Consciences, yea with <HI>Scandal</HI> to <HI>Papists,</HI> who are thereby <HI>hardened</HI> in their Idolatries; since as one well saith, <HI>The Ceremonies are Monuments of Popery, the Tro|phies of Antichrist, and the Reliques of</HI> Romes <HI>Who|rish Bravery,</HI> they therefore ought to be called <HI>Nehushtan.</HI> I wish that some who are much taken with that <HI>Socini|anizing,</HI> and at last <HI>Papizing,</HI> and most corrupt Interpre|ter <HI>Hugo Grotius,</HI> (who is extremely followed by the a|mongst Praelatical men admired Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> who in his <HI>Notes</HI> on the <HI>Nevv Testament,</HI> hath shewed all pos|sible favour to Antichrist; which things I am the rather willing to mention, not to detract any thing from the worth or deserved praise of those Authors, in respect of their great Learning, but that young Students may be Cautioned against sucking in poison from their Writings; I say, I wish such) would remember <HI>Grotius</HI> his Note on the Text which is in the following Discourses largely and elaborately discussed, <HI>Egregium (inquit) documentum Regibus, ut quamvis

ben&egrave; instituta sed non necessaria, ubi <GAP DESC="foreign">, mal&egrave; usurpantur, &egrave; conspectu tollant, ne ponant ostendiculum caecis.</HI> But besides that Argument (which yet is not easily answered) the <HI>ensuing Discourses</HI> demonstrate, That to al|low <HI>Popish,</HI> or any <HI>Non-instituted Ceremonies,</HI> a <HI>Reli|gious state</HI> and use in the Worship of God, is absolutely sin|full, as being a direct <HI>violation</HI> of the <HI>Second Command|ment.</HI></P>
<P>I confess there are other large and elaborate Tractates on the Subjects here treated on, which as yet remain unanswered, such as Mr. <HI>Parker of the Cross,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> his <HI>Fresh Suit against Ceremonies,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gelaspy</HI>'s <HI>Dispute against English Popish Ceremonies.</HI> Indeed some have glanced at less materiall Passages in the Books mentioned, but never any (that I could hear of) did strike at their whole Frame, or undertake (<GAP DESC="foreign">) to answer them, or any one of them. Nevertheless, the Publication of the Sermons here|with emitted, hath not been thought unnecessary, because they are in a Method suited to vulgar Capacities, and contain in few Pages the strength and substance of what others have voluminously expressed. Nor can those other Tractates be easily obtained, or digested by the ordinary sort of Readers, as these may. And who knoweth, but the Lord may bless what is here made publick, for the Enlightening and Esta|blishing of <HI>the Rising Generation,</HI> that they also having their Mindes well informed, and girt about with Truth, may be able to suffer, rather then comply with <HI>Prelatick Super|stitions,</HI> (or with <HI>Erastianism</HI>) for <HI>non-conformity</HI> where|to, our blessed Fathers suffered many things, and not in vain? I will likewise confess, that the remembrance of the awful Saying of that Ancient, had some impression upon my spirit, in|ducing to this Publication, <HI>Non sol&ugrave;m ille proditor verita|tis est qui pal&agrave;m mendacium pro veritate loquitur, sed etiam ille qui non liber&egrave; pronuntiat veritatem.</HI></P>

Which is the Prayer of him, who hath still an earnest desire to be found not onely amongst <HI>Witnesses,</HI> but (if the will of God be so con|cerning him) amongst <HI>Sufferers,</HI> on that account of <HI>Testi|fying against the Superstitions and Corruptions of the Times.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THis Chapter Contains the Beginning of the History of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that great <HI>Reforming Prince.</HI> The parts of the Chapter are these three; (1) There be some Gene|ral circumstances of his Reign, the time when, and how long, his Parentage &amp;c. <HI>ver. 1, 2.</HI> (2) His eminent piety in matters of Religion, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. to 7. (3) His great prosperity in the Political, or Civil affairs of his Kingdome, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. to the end.</P>
<P>His Piety is set forth two wayes, (1) By a general Testimony of him, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. He did that that was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his Father <HI>David</HI> did: (2) By a more particular enumerati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n

and induction of particulars in the words read unto you, in these five things; (1) his destroying Idolatry, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. (2) his Trusting in God, <HI>ver.</HI> 5. (3) his preheminence in piety above all the Kings of Judah. <HI>Ibid.</HI> (4) his faithful cleaving to God in his Word. <HI>ver.</HI> 6. (5) The prospering presence of God with him in all his affairs. <HI>ver.</HI> 7. From which five particulars, we may accordingly observe five points of Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the destruction of Idolatry, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. Observe. <HI>That it is a thing very right and pleasing in the sight of God, when the sin of Idolatry and all the monuments of it, all the remembrances, and remainders of it are quite destroyed, and rooted up from amongst his people.</HI> For thus <HI>He|zekiah</HI> did, and it is said in the third verse, he did that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch was right in the sight of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas it is noted of him, that he trusted in the Lord God of Israel, <HI>ver.</HI> 5. Observe from hence. <HI>That nothing will carry a man through in the work of Reformation, but trusting, and relying upon God by Faith.</HI> For so did this good King: A man may begin, reforme a little, and doe something in the work of God as <HI>Jehu</HI> did, for his own ends, but he never went through with it, because he trusted not in the Lord God of Israel, but in his own carnal policy; therefore he left the calves at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> removing some Idols, but leaving others: but to goe through with the work, requires a Spirit plainly Heroical, a Spi|rit of Faith, and firm relyance, and dependance upon God. There be so many, and to the eye of carnal reason, such insuperable difficulties and impediments in the work of Reformation, That a man shall never be able to surmount and get above them without an Almighty assistance from the Lord: <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zekiah</HI> could not but see what reproach and danger he did incurr, and expose himself unto by it; The clamours of the peo|ple for their old Religion, the Religion of their Fathers, the Scandal it would give to many: <HI>Rabshakeh</HI> tells him he had destroyed the wor|ship of God, and calls him in effect an Heretick, and a Schismatick. <HI>ver.</HI> 22. <HI>If you say we trust in the Lord our God, is not that he whose High places, and whose Altars</HI> Hezekiah <HI>hath taken away</HI>? and he up|braids him also with trusting upon that bruised reed, even upon Egypt. <HI>ver.</HI> 21. Here were sad reproaches, and discouragements from men, but his hope was in the Lord, he trusted in the Lord God of Israel.</P>
<P N="3">3. From his preheminence in Piety above all his Predecessors and Successors; Observe. <HI>That a reforming Spirit in Magistrates as it is very excel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, so it is very rare.</HI> ver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. After him there was none like him amongst all the Kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.


<PB REF="000151_0008_0FA2B7DC823DF598">
By which expressions we are to understand, that there were but very few, for there was one or two, for he is parallel'd with <HI>David, ver.</HI> 3. And the same expression is afterwards used concerning <HI>Josiah,</HI> 2 Kin. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.25. So that these three, <HI>David, Hezekiah, Iosiah,</HI> were the three great Reformers, and therefore when it is said, there was none like <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> the expression is a little Hyperbolical, and but a little, for there was but two more amongst all the Kings of Judah: The meaning therefore is not <HI>prorsus nemo,</HI> but <HI>f&egrave;re nemo,</HI> as <HI>Piscator</HI> well expounds it. For it is the Hebrew phrase of Speech to use a Negative, when it intends a Su|perlative. There is a parallel expression in <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.<HI>19. None that goe to her return again,</HI> that is, very, very few, <HI>not one of a thousand,</HI> but some there are; as <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> out of whom Christ did cast seven unclean Devils, but where will you finde such another? So when <HI>Paul</HI> saith of <HI>Timothy, I finde no man like minded to seek the Churches good,</HI> Phil. 2.<HI>20.</HI> There was <HI>Titus,</HI> and one, or two more, who had the same Spirit, but alas how few! how few!</P>
<P>It is true, there were some other reforming Kings in <HI>Iudah</HI>; but none like these who were <HI>the first three,</HI> for the rest had great blemishes. <HI>Asa</HI> was a reforming King, but there is one black mark upon him, for he persecuted the Prophet <HI>Hanani,</HI> for reproving him; and he oppres|sed some of the people at the same time, whereby his Sun did set under such a Cloud that some have questioned whether he was a god|ly man; <HI>2 Chron. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.10. Iehosaphat</HI> did Reforme Religion, but he entred into a sinfull League with that great Idolater <HI>Ahab,</HI> and though the Prophet <HI>Iehu</HI> reproved him for it, 2 <HI>Chron. 19.2.</HI> and though we do not finde that he was so exceeding vile as to persecute the Pro|phet for it, yet he fell into the same sin again with <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> for which God destroyed his Navy, and broke his Fleet of Ships that should have gone to <HI>Tarshish,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron. 20. ult.</HI> King <HI>Vzziah</HI> likewise was true to Gods worship in the beginning of his Reign, but afterwards, his pros|perity puft him up, and he invaded the Priests Office to his own de|struction, 2 <HI>Chr.</HI> 26 4, <HI>16.</HI> And if you look into our own Histories of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> how few shall you finde! It was prophesied of them, that they should give both <GAP DESC="foreign"> both their force of Arms, and their Power of Laws to the Beast, to serve the Popes Interest&punc; <HI>Rev. 17.13.</HI> And accordingly they have fully accomplished it till the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eigth, who began the Reformation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Here is <HI>Hezekiah</HI> his cleaving to the Lord, and to his Word, <HI>ver.</HI> 6 For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from after him, but kept his Commandments, which the Lord commanded <HI>Moses.</HI> Hence


<PB REF="000151_0009_0FA2B7DD418E02A0">
the fourth Doctrine is this. <HI>That the Rule of Reformation in Religion, is the will and Word of God:</HI> He that will reform aright, must reduce, and bring all things back to that Rule: when <HI>Iohn</HI> was to measure the Temple, and to reform the Church, there was a Reed given unto him like a Rod, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.1. and <HI>Rev.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.15. The new <HI>Ierusalem</HI> is measured with a golden Reed. It is spoken with allusion to <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Vision, <HI>Chap.</HI> 40. <HI>ver.</HI> 3. which <HI>measuring Reed,</HI> can be no other but <HI>the Word of God.</HI> Hence we call the Scriptures <HI>Canonical,</HI> because they are the Rule of all Religion. It is not the wills and lusts of men, but what the Lord hath Commanded us by <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets, and by Christ and his Apostles.</P>
<P N="5">5. The last particular is, The prospering presence of God with this re|forming Magistrate, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. And the Lord was with him, and he pros|pered whithersoever he went forth. Hence observe, 5. <HI>That a through Reformation of Religion according to the Word of God, to the rooting up of all Idolatry, is the way to obtain the prospering presence of God with us in whatsoever we take in hand.</HI> Let <HI>Hezekiah</HI> turn himself which way he will, the Lord went with him. It is promised, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1.3. <HI>He that delights in the Law of the Lord, whatsoever he doth shall prosper,</HI> and the same thing is noted concerning other reforming Kings, as King <HI>Vzziah,</HI> 2 Chron. 26.5. <HI>As long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper, and he did great things.</HI> Men are apt to think it will cause trouble, di|sturb all things, and bring Heaven and Earth together, but it is indeed the way to prosper.</P>
<P>Thus you see the principal Truths, and points of Doctrine, that are contained in the words. I shall resume and prosecute a little more fully the first of them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Observ. <HI>That it is a thing very pleasing in the sight of God, when the sin of Idolatry, and all the monuments, all the remembrances &amp; remain|ders of it are quite destroyed, and rooted out from amongst his people.</HI> For <HI>Hezekiah</HI> here made through work of it, he removed the High places, and brake the Images, and cut down the Groves, and brake in pieces the brazen Serpent, he spared nothing that had the Devils stamp upon it; If he had spared any thing, it would have been the brazen Ser|pent, for the honour of the first Founder, for it was <HI>Moses</HI> that made it, and that by Gods appointment; but yet being now abused to Idolatry he brake it in pieces, and calls it <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hushtan,</HI> which is a name of Con|tempt; as indeed when men are speaking of Idolatry, there ought to be a sting of holy indignation in the very expressing of it. In <HI>Num.</HI> 21.9. It is called <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>nehash nehosne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> but here only <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Ne|hushtan.</HI>


<PB N="5" REF="000151_0010_0FA2B7DE09612368">
There it was denominated both from the Form and matter, but here from the matter only. There it was called a Serpent of brass, but now he calls it <HI>a meer piece of brass,</HI> the stamp of Institution being ta|ken off, and the thing having been horribly abused to Idolatry, or as some have not unfitly rendered it, <HI>that base piece of brass.</HI> For the pro|secution of this Doctrine, four things are necessary to be spoken to; (1) what is meant by Idolatry? (2) what by the monuments of it? (3) How it may appear that the Lord will have them to be rooted up. (4) The reasons of this Severity of God against this Sin?</P>
<P N="1">1. What is meant by Idolatry?</P>
<P><HI>Answ. Idolatry</HI> in general, <HI>is the worshiping of Images or Idols.</HI> Now there be two sorts of Images, and therefore two sorts of Idolatry. First, <HI>against the Object of worship, in the first Commandment.</HI> Secondly, <HI>against the means of worship in the Second.</HI> The Idolatry forbidden in the first Commandment is, <HI>when the worship is terminated upon a false Object,</HI> and not upon the True God that made Heaven and Earth. But the Idolatry forbidden in the second Commandment is, <HI>when the worship</HI> is directed to the True God, but <HI>by false wayes and means,</HI> which he had never ap|pointed, and which never came into his heart: we commonly call it for distinction sake, <HI>Superstition,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Cultus supra statutum,</HI> a worship beside, and beyond the Rule. The Scripture calls it Idolatry, or the worshipping of Idols, and Superstition, and <HI>will-wor|ship,</HI> Col. 2. <HI>ult.</HI> Acts 7 41. and <HI>Acts 17.16, 22.</HI></P>
<P>The Idolatry against which the Prophets are so frequently, and almost continually thundring forth the wrath of God throughout the Old Te|stament, and which is so much condemned also in the New, and which the People were chiefly guilty of. It is for the most part this latter. For when they made the Calf, <HI>Exod</HI>- 32. <HI>They said, These he thy Gods, O Israel, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt.</HI> ver 4. and they pro|claimed a Holy day, not to the Calf, but to <HI>Jehovah, ver. 5.</HI> Of whom the Calf was but an Image, in which they looked at <HI>Iehovah,</HI> as near unto them &amp; as going with them, &amp; before them. <HI>ver.</HI> 1 Their intention there|fore was to worship the True God, but in a way of their own. And in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke manner <HI>Micah's mother,</HI> she dedicated the Silver to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ehovah</HI> to make a gra|ven Image, <HI>Iudges</HI> 17.3. &amp; <HI>Micah</HI> concludes, <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> last, that now <HI>Iehovah</HI> would do him good. Yea, <HI>Ieroboam</HI> himself, when he set up his <HI>Calves at Dan and Bethel,</HI> he proclaims, <HI>behold thy Gods O Israel, which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt,</HI> 1 King. 12.28, which is a description of the True God, so that it was not <HI>Ieroboam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> intention to introduce a|nother Object of worship, but only another manner of worship, but


<PB N="6" REF="000151_0011_0FA2B7DED2F8D790">
yet seeing he worshipped God in a false way, The Scripture charge him for <HI>worshipping the Devil,</HI> 2 Chron. 11.15. <HI>He ordained Priests for the Devils, which he had made.</HI> Yea, I finde that our Divines

Cartwright 2 Reply pag. 185, 186, 187.</HI></Q> do observe against the Papists, that the very Heathens, and Pagans were not so sottish, as to terminate their worship upon a dead piece of Wood, and Stone; though perhaps some of the blindest of them might look no further, yet the more knowing ones amongst them did look upon their Idols as the Images and representations of some higher Deity, from whence they called them <HI>simulachra Deorum,</HI> the representations of the Gods.
For they knew that God was a Spirit, as in that Verse of <HI>Cato. Si Deus est animus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it pur&acirc; mente colendus</HI>: and that Heaven is his dwelling place: Hence they said, <HI>Acts 14.11.</HI> The Gods are come down unto us in the likeness of men. And when reproved for their Idolatry, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Austin in Psal 118 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> <HI>Austine saith,</HI> the common people themselves were wont to Answer,
<Q><HI>se non visibile illud colere, sed numen, quodillic invisibilit&eacute;r habitabit</HI></Q>, that they did not worship the visible Image, but that which dwelt invisibly in it.
But yet they were <HI>Idolaters</HI> in the sight of God, and are charged with this guilt every where throughout the Scripture. For they did herein grossly <HI>break the second commandment.</HI> For the further opening whereof, because it will give light unto all that followeth to be spoken; the second Command|ment with the Scriptures apperteining thereto, (being that spiritual Ar|mory out of which whosoever will fight against Superstition must fetch their Weapons;) you may observe briefly these four things concern|ing it.</P>

<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What is ment by the Monuments of Idolatry?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. Such things as being indifferent in their own Nature, have been abused, and polluted with Idolatry.</HI> This is evident from the Instance of the <HI>Brazen Serpent</HI> in the Text, of which you may observe a threefold state. 1. Religious. 2. Indifferent. 3. Sinful.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Religious,</HI> and necessary. For the first Original of it was not Hu|mane, but Divine. It was once a Type of Christ, and spiritual Healing through him, as Christ himself expounds it, Joh. 3.14, 15. and there|fore it was then a spiritual and a blessed Ordinance of God. But this necessary, and commanded use of the Serpent, was (as Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> observs) <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Mr. Cart. rest of 2d. reply pag 262</NOTE> <HI>but for the time, wherein it was a means to heal those that were bitten.</HI> This use therefore Ceased, and the Stamp of Institution was taken off, when the fiery Serpents Ceased, when they came out of the Wilderness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>After this, it was retained, and set up as it seemeth upon the Walls of the Temple, as a Monument of that miraculous mercy and healing, which they had formerly received by it</HI> in the Wilderness. and <HI>this use of it was not Instituted, but only indifferent,</HI> and it seems to be of the same nature with the laying up of <HI>Goliahs</HI> Sword at <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> behind the <HI>Ephod</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr. Fulke against Saun|ders of Images, pag. 64.

and a kind of Immobility in Gods Service; The like may be said concerning the brasen Serpent.

<P>Now this explication cuts off those Objections, If all the monuments of Idolatry must be destroyed, then so must Baptism, and the Lords Sup|per, say some; because they have been abused by the Papists. <HI>Answ.</HI> It followeth not, for the brasen Serpent was not an Ordinance at this time, when <HI>Hezekiah</HI> brake it in pieces, it was only an indifferent thing abused. But the <HI>Sacraments</HI> are <HI>standing Ordinances,</HI> and the Ordinances of Christ cannot be looked upon as monuments of Idolatry, for they are <HI>not indifferent</HI> things abused, but duties Commanded and appointed by the Lord Jesus. Therefore the abuse of them must be re|formed and rectified, but the right use retained and continued. As when the Vessels of the Temple had been polluted and abused in Babylon, where they became <HI>Belshazzars</HI> quaffing bowls, they were not therefore laid aside by the people of God in their return out of Babylon, but re|stored and brought back to their former right use in the Temple: So when it is Objected, that then publick meeting places for worship must be pulled down, and the use of Cups and Vessels in the Sacrament laid aside, because the Papists have abused them. I Answer still as before, that these things are not monuments of Idolatry, for though they be not Ordinances, yet they are <HI>necessary appurtenances to them.</HI> For when God appoints any Ordinance, the Institution thereof implies and car|ries with it an <HI>Implicite Warrant</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the use of all such things as are ne|cessary to the celebration of it.

<PB N="13" REF="000151_0018_0FA2B7E7EADCF238">Q. <HI>But what may be the Reason of this severe and fierce displeasure of God against this sin?</HI></P>
<P>This had need be spoken to, for men are apt to make light of these sins, to think that Ministers are more zealous then wise, to preach against them, and that the Lord himself will not be so severe to punish them, nay, which is some what strange, they hope to please God by them, and are apt to alledge their Idolatry as an excuse, and to hold it up as a Shield of defence, when reproved for other sins. But therefore the Scripture lays load upon it. <HI>Hos</HI> 8.11. <HI>Ephraim hath made many Altars to sin</HI>: they thought to worship God, but the Text saith, it was to sin against him. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 9 15. <HI>all their wickednes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is in</HI> Gilgal, that is their great|est wickedness, for there were many other sins amongst them, <HI>sed hic nomen <GAP DESC="foreign"> accipitur pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> summo vel praecipuo</HI> saith <HI>Calvin,</HI> as if the Prophet should say, all their Whoredoms, Robberies, and Oppressions, and other Crying sins, which did abound amongst them, were not so bad as their Idolatries and Superstitions there committed. No sin like this. The greatness of it will appear, if you Consider, 1. <HI>The nature of it,</HI> 2. <HI>The Causes from whence it comes,</HI> 3. <HI>The effects that flow from it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In the nature of this sin, there be four things that make it very odious in the sight of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because it is a sin of high Rebellion against the will of God.</HI> The worship required in the First Commandment is called Natural worship, because it ariseth from the very nature of God, and the Creature. Hence to withdraw that inward Homage and worship of Faith, Hope, and Love, and the actings thereof, in Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssing his name, hearing his Word, praying, and returning the praise of all to him, or to bestow and employ these chief affections and actings of the Soul upon other Ob|jects, it strikes directly and immediately at the very nature of God, and denyes his natural dominion, and that Relation that we have to Him as his Creatures. But the second Commandment which Contains the In|stituted worship of God, floweth from the will of God, and therefore for men to resist this, is to set up their own wills, above, and against Gods, as it is excellently set forth by the Prophet <HI>Ieremy,</HI> The Lord saith by his Prophets, <HI>oh, do not this abominable thing which</HI> I <HI>hate,</HI> but the People say, <HI>we will not hearken unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but we will certainly do whatsoever goeth out of our own mouth, to burn Incens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto the Queen of Heaven.</HI> Jer 4.4, 16, 17 They say in brief, our own will sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> stand.

to have their own wills, which must needs provoke the Lord exceeding+ly.

But for a poor sinful Creature to set up his own fooli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, frow|ard will, against the holy, blessed will of God, How, Can the Lord bear this?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a sin of much reproach to the wisdome of God, for men to wor|ship God in their own wayes.</HI> It is as charging God with folly, as if the Infinite bless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d God were not wise enough to find out the best and fittest way for his own worship and glory: Hence the Lord, whose judge|ments are suitable to the sins of men, such as delight in this sin, he wounds their heads, and smites their understandings, that their <HI>foolish Hearts are darkned, and professing themselves wise, they become fools.</HI> Rom. 1.22.

<P N="3">3. <HI>It is a sin of Whoredome against that spiritual Chastity that the Lord requires of his people</HI>: There is nothing more frequent in the Scripture then to express Idolatry under the name of Whoredome and Adultery, for it is a breach of the Marriage-Covenant, and a yielding that honour to another, to a Creature, to an Idol, which is due to none, but God. <HI>Lev.</HI> 17.7. <HI>They shall no more offer their Sacrifices unto Devils, after whom they have gone a whoring</HI>; Gideons <HI>Ephod,</HI> Judges 8.27. <HI>they went a whoring after it.</HI> With their Idols have they Committed Adul|tery, <HI>Ezek. 23.37.</HI> and throughout that Chapter. The two Idolatrous Cities, <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem</HI> are compared to two adulterous Wo|men, <HI>Aholah,</HI> and <HI>Aholihah. They have Committed Adultery with Stocks and Stones.</HI> Jer. 3.9. that is, because they made them <HI>media Cul|tus.</HI> Hence <HI>Rome</HI> is called <HI>the Mother of Harlots,</HI> Rev 17.5. And <HI>pure Worshippers,</HI> who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, are <HI>called Virgins,</HI> Rev. 14.4. Hence the Lord professeth in the Sanction of the second Commandment, <HI>I am a jealous God</HI>; now the Object of jealou+sie is <HI>Conjugal Chastity,</HI> and as jealousie is the rage of a man, so the jea+lousie of God is the highest wrath of God.</P>

<P N="2">2 <HI>Look at the Causes of it,</HI> from whence it comes. and here we must not give heed to what men pretend, nor yet to what they think. For men do not know their own hearts, nor the springs and principles of their own actions, but the Lord he knows, and the Scripture discovers, and searcheth the deepest corners and Secrets of the Heart. Therefore let us see what the Scripture saith to it. We must be very circumspect herein to speak nothing, but what the Scripture saith. For to speak without the Scripture is Censoriousness, but to speak plainly according to it, is Faithfulness. <HI>Isai.</HI> 58.1. <HI>Cry aloud &amp; spare not,</HI> saih the Lord, but <HI>lift up thy voice like Trumpet, shew my People their Transgressions, &amp; the House of Iacob their sins.</HI> It was <HI>Ierusalems</HI> Calamity and ruine, <HI>that her Prophets did see vain and foolish things for her, and did not discover her iniquity, to turn away her Captivity</HI>: Lam. 2.14. Now the Scripture takes notice of many distempers and Corruptions in the hearts of men, whereby they are inclined to this sin of Idolatry and Superstition, and in some respects more propense and prone to it, then to open profaneness. I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll In|stance in six particulars, whereby you will see that it must needs be evil and bitter fruit, that hath such bitter Roots and Causes.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Forgetfulness of God,</HI> Hos. 8.14. <HI>Israel hath forgotten his Maker,


<PB N="16" REF="000151_0021_0FA2B7EEC4D12780">
and buildeth Temples,</HI> and when they made the molten Calf, though they did proclaim an holy day to <HI>Iehovah,</HI> yet it is said, <HI>they forgat God their Saviour,</HI> Psal. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">06.19, 20, 21.</HI> This will seem very strange to carnal reason, for men are apt to think, they do it out of very good devotion, because they do, or would remember, and put themselves in mind of their duty towards God, as when men bow to a Crucifix, or to the name of Jesus, or the like, surely they remember Christ one would think, but let them pretend what they will, the Text is clear, <HI>they forget God their Saviour,</HI> it is because they forget the Lord Jesus, they do not remember him with any true and right affection. Hence we see it in daily experi|ence, that <HI>the same persons who are most prophane, are usually most Su|perstitious,</HI> they that forget God most in moral duties, are most devout in wayes of Superstition, so that prophaneness is one Cause of Supersti|tion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It comes from pride,</HI> Col. 2.18. <HI>Let no man beguile you by volunta|ry humility, being vainly puft up in his fleshly mind.</HI> And this accompani|ed with deep hypocrisie, <HI>for neither they themselves who are circumeised keep the Law, but desire to have you Circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</HI> Gal. 6.13. that they may boast amongst the Jews, how ma|ny followers and Proselytes they have gained, it was their ambition and desire of applause that acted them. Profaneness is a discredit amongst men, and therefore though many are, and will be prophane, yet there be few that would seem so; now the best and likeliest way to hide this na|kedness, is to cover it with the fig-leaves of Superstition. <HI>Iezabel,</HI> therefore, when she intended murther, proclaims a Fast. The <HI>Pharisees devour Widows Houses, but for a pretence they made long prayers.</HI> So that here was pride mixt with Hypocrisie, but God loves Truth in the inward parts, and he delights to abase the Sons of Pride&punc;</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fleshly wisdom, or carnal Policy,</HI> is another ground and prin|ciple of Superstition. Almost all the sin and misery that hath filled the World, hath broke in at this door, hearkning to reason against Institu|tion. Hence, Idolaters and Superstitious persons, have never wanted pretence of Reason for it: they think first, to please God by it. 2. To secure themselves. 3. To Circumvent and over-reach others. 1 <HI>To please God.</HI> Having run into great arreares by gross neglects in moral obedience, they think to make it up with Ceremonials, either of Gods appointing, or of their own devising. <HI>Wherewith shall I come before God? will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of Rivers of Oyl? shall I give my first born for my Transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my Soul.</HI> Mic. 6.6, 7, 8.

For it is an easy thing to walk in their own wayes, and to follow their own devises. What an easy thing is it to nod and bow to an Altar? but it is hard to mortify a lust. It was an easy thing to the Pharisees to Tyth Mint and Cummin, and to wash their Cups and Platters, but it is a great and difficult work to cleanse and wash the heart from filthiness. So that Superstition though it seems to be overbusy, yet it is indeed but a lazy thing, and suits that distemper of spiritual Sloth; A mans Conscience would torment and tear him in pieces, Hell from beneath would rise up for him, if he should have no Religion at all: but the power and life of godliness is difficult, Hence men rest in shadows, and sit down with Superstitious empty Forms and shews of Devotion, by which Conscience being charmed, they think God is pacified, and all is clear above head. 2. <HI>They hope to secure themselves by it, as to this World.</HI> This made <HI>Jeroboam</HI> to set up the Idolatry at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> and <HI>Jehu</HI> to continue it, <HI>for he said in his heart, if this people go up to Ierusalem to do Sacrifice in the House of the Lord at Ierusalem, the Kingdom will return to the House of</HI> David. <HI>1 Kin. 12.26, 27,</HI> And upon the like account <HI>Ahaz</HI> made sundry changes to the prejudice of Gods worship, because of the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> that is for fear of him, and that he might please him. <HI>And he Sacrificed to the Gods of</HI> Damascus, <HI>which smote him, saying</HI> in his foolish, carnal wisdom, <HI>because the Gods of the Kings of</HI> Syria <HI>help them, therefore will I Sacrifice to them, that they may help me, but they were the ruine of Him, and of all Is|rael.</HI> 2 Chron. 28.23.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isai. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 5, 6.</HI></NOTE> For it is usual with God to Curse and blast the carnal policies of men, when they hatch such cockatrice eggs, and weav the Spiders web, he that eateth of their eggs dyeth, and that which is Cru|shed breaketh out into a Viper, their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works, being works of Iniquity.</P>

so plausible to worldly wisdom, which of all other Fruits of the Flesh, is for the most part the hardliest and last renounced; that even Christians have mightily overreached and entangled themselves by too much seeking to Circumvent, or go beyond others. <NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Ames fresh <HI>Suit</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art 2 pag <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3 5000.</NOTE> Hence in the declining times of the Christian Churches, perceiving that the Pagans were very tenacious of their old Customs and Superstitions, they thought it was good policy to borrow sundry things from them to win them, and to bring them over to the Christian Religion.

But what was the issue and effect of this Carnal policy? Instead of making Pagans turn Chri|stians by it, they did transform Christian Churches into Anti-Christian, It was this fleshly wisdom that was the means to conjure up those two venemous Beasts, the Church, and Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> Rev. 13.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It proceeds from a Spirit of folly and delusion.</HI> For a mans own wisdom is folly, such things indeed have a shew of wisdom, <HI>Col. 2.</HI> last. But that's all, for <HI>professing themselves to be wise, they become fools.</HI> Rom. 1.22. They have not known nor understood, for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see, and their hearts that they cannot understand, and none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor under|standing to say, I have burnt part of it in the fire, yea, also I have baked bread upon the Coals thereof, I have roasted-flesh and eaten it, and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the Stock of a Tree? <HI>He feedeth on ashes, a deceived heart hath turned him a|side, that he cannot deliver his Soul, nor say, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</HI> Isai. 44.18, 19, 20. So that all the Zeal and affection men have in a Superstitious way is but blind Devotion, and zeal without knowledge. Thou blind Pharisee, every man is bruitish in his knowledge, every Founder is confounded by the graven Image, For his molten Image is falshood, and there is no breath in them, they are vanity, and the work of errors, in the time of their visitation they shall perish. <HI>Ier. 10.14, 15.</HI> and you have the same words again repeated, <HI>Ier. 51.17, 18.</HI> Hence dark|ness and a sad eclspse, and decay of light and knowledge in the Church, was the Immediate forerunner of Anti-Christ, with all his Idolatryes and Superstitions.

Christ,</HI> Gal. 6.12. It was by this means as some have observed, that the Pope got up, and kept all his Idolatryes, because the Ministry that should have stood in the gap were for the most, though indeed not all, for God was pleased even then to raise up some faithful Witnesses, but <HI>the Generality of the Clergy,</HI> during the reign of Anti-Christ, were as one saith of them, <HI>a Generation of spiritual Cowards,</HI> so that the Pope did what he listed, in laying loads and yokes upon the Conscience, and they like <HI>Issachar</HI> were content to <HI>Couch under every burthen,</HI> yea, which is worse, forward and active to serve the Popes lusts, and to impose bur|den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and lay snares for the Consciences of men, as the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> complains of <HI>the Superstitious Clergy</HI> in his time, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.8. <HI>The Prophet is as the Snare of a Fowler in all his wayes.</HI> I remember a Story in the Book of Martyrs of one that had been a Protestant, but when persecuti|on arose, he fell back to Popery, and when one of his Friends told him of his former profession, <HI>oh (saith</HI> he,) <HI>that was the right way, but I can|not burn, I cannot burn.</HI> But his House happening to be on fire, and going in to fetch out some of his Goods, he was burnt in his own House. He that could not burn at a Stake for the Truth, was burnt to death in his own House; but it had been better to burn in the Cause of God, then in the way of his judgements. Now if this be one Cause of Idolatry and Superstition, It must needs be a very great sin. When men shall fear men more then God, and those that can but kill the body, more then him that is able to destroy both Soul and body in Hell. Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall dye, and of the Son of man that shall be made as grass, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker, that hath stretched forth the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the Earth, and best feared continually every day because of the fury of the Oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the Oppressor, <HI>Isai. 51.12, 13.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, <HI>It proceeds from secret enmity and hatred of the blessed God.</HI> For as it is assign of love to God, to love his Ordinances, so on the contrary, for men to cast the second Commandment behind their backs, it is a sign they hate Him. Hence the Lord there threatens <HI>I will visit the sin of them that Hate mee, and shew mercy to thousands of them that love mee.</HI> So in <HI>Hos. 9.7.</HI> He threatens to visit them <HI>for the multi|tude of their iniquity and the great hatred.</HI> It is true, in times of Igno|rance and darkness good men may be carried away in many things with the stream of the times for want of better light But <HI>to be zealous for the grossest Superstitions in times of light, is an ill sign</HI> that the heart is full of poyson, full of Hatred, and Enmity against the Lord, &amp; against his blessed


<PB N="20" REF="000151_0025_0FA2B7F320E93778">
wayes. And it is the worse, because that Superstitious persons pretend much love and devotion, as though they thought nothing too dear, nor too much for God, when there is the poyson of Asps underneath. No wonder therefore, if the Lord abhorrs them. For there is nothing more odious both to God and men, then hatred masked over with pretences of love. And thus you see from the Causes of this sin, how great a sin it is.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Consider also the Cursed effects and Fruits of it,</HI> the bitter Fruits that grow upon this root of bitterness, These will yet further discover the evil of it. Men are apt to think their own Inventions are of much use in the worship of God, though they call them sometimes <HI>Indiffer|ent things,</HI> yet they think them very good and necessary. But the Lord hath said the <HI>graven Image is profitable,</HI> or good <HI>for nothing.</HI> Isai. 44.10. no good comes of it, but much hurt and mischief every way. It is a sin that hath many woeful effects.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It deceivs and deludes,</HI> it is a very deceiving and infatuateing sin. It is the Lords direction to <HI>Joshua</HI> to <HI>keep close to the Rule,</HI> and to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> that thou mayest prosper, or as it may be rendred, <HI>that thou mayest deal understandingly wherever thou shalt goe</HI>: Josh. 1.7, 8. but on the contrary, when men worship God according to their own Inventi|ons, see that dreadful threatning, <HI>Isai.</HI> 29.13, 14. <HI>because their fear,</HI> that is, their worship <HI>towards me is taught by the precepts of men, therefore, be|hold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work amongst this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise men shall pe|rish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid</HI>; they shall be befooled and infatuated even to admiration, <HI>they are altogether bruitish and foolish; the stock is a doctrine of vanityes.</HI> Jer. 10 8. And <HI>the molten Image a teacher of lyes,</HI> Heb. 2.18. <HI>for their Idols have spoken vanity, and their Diviners have seen a lye,</HI> Zech. <HI>10.2.</HI> The Scripture is very fre|quent and copious in this Argument, because men are very apt to value their own Inventions and Additions to the worship of God at a high rate, and to admire and applaud themselves therein; as if they had con|tributed not a little to the Majesty, and to the Splendour of it, by their Great wisdom and prudential power, as they call it; when it is indeed <HI>pru|dential folly,</HI> their glory is their shame, <HI>they are mad upon their Idols,</HI> Jer. <HI>50.38. Superstitio est res insana,</HI> as he said, Superstition is a mad thing, folly is the Cause of it, and folly the Effect.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a very defiling sin, thou hast defiled thy self in thine Idols which thou hast made,</HI> Ezek. 22.4.

<P N="3">3. <HI>It makes all their worship vain,</HI> as it makes their Spirits vain, by deluding and defiling them, so it spoyls and frustrates their religious worship. <HI>In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the Command|ments of men,</HI> Mat. 15 9. they Sacrifice flesh, the sacrifices of mine of|ferings, and eat it, but the Lord accepteth them not: <HI>Hos. 8.13.</HI> because they did it contrary to the Institution.

And though there be a whole Sea of worship&punc; and Ordinances, that all should be but like the blood of a dead man; as <HI>Rev. 8.8.</HI> and <HI>16.</HI>3. There is no acceptance but in Christ. But Christ hath said concerning Idolatrous worship, <HI>I will not pour out their Oblations,</HI> that is, (<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">See Ans|worth in Psal. 16.4.</NOTE> I will not be a Mediator to their Services. <HI>Psal. 16.4.</HI></P>

<P>Yea though they be good men that are guilty of it, as sometimes they have been, especially in former darker times, yet this will not pro|tect them, nor stave off the judgements of God. <HI>Gideon</HI> was a good man and a great Reformer, and therefore called <HI>Ierubbaal,</HI> but yet for all that, he did but make a Superstitious garment, a kind of a <HI>Surplice,</HI> a small matter one would think; but it <HI>became a Snare to</HI> Gideon, <HI>and his House,</HI> Judg. 8.27. <HI>Solomon</HI> was a good man, and it was he that built the Temple of the God of Heaven, but yet he fell to the publique countenancing of Idolatry, and for this, God rent away the Ten Tribes, the greatest part of his Kingdome from him, and had it not been for his Father <HI>Davids</HI> sake, he had lost them all, Yea, so provoking to the Lord is this sin, especially, if aggravated by Persecution, as for the most

part it is, that sometimes the Lord will not pardon it, and turn away his wrath, though men do repent; as in <HI>Manass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hs</HI> Case. Though as to <HI>personal forgiveness,</HI> the Lord will pardon every repenting Sinner, yet not alwayes as to <HI>National Forgiveness,</HI> so as to avert and turn away his righteous judgements.

<P N="6">6. <HI>There is yet a further Effect of this Sin, which is worse then all the rest, if worse can be.</HI> It is this, <HI>It does so harden the hearts of men, that it is a very rare and difficult thing to get true repentance for it</HI>: you may see this in those <HI>great Idolaters</HI> the <HI>Papists,</HI> as they are described in the Book of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> when under the execution of Gods righteous judge|ments, under the sixth Trumpet, The Lord looses the four Angels about the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> that is, the Turks, who were at first four Nations, to plague the Anti Christian World for their Idolatry, and to destroy, and to kill up the third part of men, but what was the Effect of this, did they repent? no; no such matter, <HI>the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet they repented not of their worshipping of Devils, and Idols of wood and stone,</HI> Rev. 9.20. well let us go a little further, when the Seventh Trumpet sounds and pours down all the seven Vials of the last plague, and the wrath of God upon the Anti-Christian party, surely, that will convince them, they will repent then, when the third woe is come upon them, which hath seven Vials of wrath in the womb of it: no, for all this, they repent not, but they are described to be like men in Hell, <HI>Rev. 16.10, 11.</HI> the fifth Angel pours out his Vial upon <HI>the throne of the Beast,</HI> which is generally understood concerning the City of <HI>Rome it self,</HI> and his Kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain; but they blasphemed the God of Heaven, because of their pains, and their sores, and <HI>they repented not of their needs</HI>: They roar under their plagues, but repent not of their Sins.

<P N="1">

<PB N="24" REF="000151_0029_0FA2B7F642EA1030">1. <HI>Because it is usual with God when men love their sins, and hate to be re|formed, he gives them up judicially to their Sins, that their Sins may be their Plagues.</HI> Hence it is threatned as a punishment of Idolatry, <HI>Deut</HI> 4.<HI>25, 28.</HI> Because they have corrupted themselves with graven Images, therefore they should serve Gods of wood and Stone, which neither hear, nor see, nor eat, nor smell: when they had made the molten Calf, then God turned, and gave them up to worship the Hoast of Heaven, <HI>Acts 7.42.</HI> He gave them up for that sin, to more sin: <HI>Ephraim is joyn|ed to Idols let him alone,</HI> Hos. 4.17. <HI>Because</HI> Ephraim <HI>hath made many Altars to sin, Altars shall be unto him to sin,</HI> Hos 8.11. They will have their sins to live in them, therefore saith the Lord, they shall have them to be plagued by them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>And as this sin is the punishment of itself, so it is often punished with other sins also, sometimes he gives them up to bodily uncleanness for their spiritual Whoredoms,</HI> Hos. 4.13. they Sacrifice upon the tops of the moun|tains, and burn Incense upon the Hills, under Oaks and Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars, and Elms, because the shadow thereof is good, <HI>therefore your Daughters shall commit Whoredom, and your Spouses shall commit Adultery,</HI> Hos. 4.13.

And when sinners are bound in so many black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etters and Chains of darkness, how hard a thing is it to break them off, by true re|pentance?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When men are given up to Idolatry, or to any other sin, by such a judcial act of God, it so deludes the mind, and darkens the understanding, that it is impossible to fasten a Conviction upon them,</HI> they will never be|lieve, nor be perswaded that this is the sin for which God Smites, and if no Conviction, no repentance. The Jews thought, <HI>Ier. 44.18. Since we left off to burn Incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offer|ings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the Sword, and by the Famine, whereas</HI> the Prophet tells them, because you have burnt Incense, therefore this evil is happened unto you, but they would not be|lieve him: And just so the Papists, oh, say they, It was never good world since the old Religion was put down, and since we left the holy Catho|lick Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And I have heard of some <HI>Lutheran</HI> Ministers

after the late Wars and desolations of <HI>Germany,</HI> who have concluded and thought that the Reason of Gods wrath against them was the pul|ling down of Images. And there be some in like manner at this day, that ascribe all the Warrs and Troubles, and evils of the late times that have passed over these Nations, to the pulling down of Bishops, and Ceremo|nies; whereas it was indeed the old Sins of <HI>the Bishops and that party,</HI> their adulterating and corrupting the worship of God with Popish Inno|vations, Their violence and Persecutions of Gods faithful Witnessse and Servants; that was the chief procuring cause of all the plagues and judgements that have come upon the Land.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A mans Repentance is never true till it be proportionable to the nature of his Sins.</HI> It is not enough for men to leave these Sins, but they must also loath themselves in their own sight for all their abominations, be|cause that I am broken with their whorish hearts, which go a whoring after their Idols, as the Lord there speaks,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ezek. 6.9.</HI></NOTE> but how hard is it to get such a self-loathing, self-abhorring frame of Spirit, not only to see that it is a Sin, but to see the exceeding vileness of it, and to loath it as God loaths it, to hate it as God hates it. I have Insisted the longer upon the Rea|sons of the point, that you may see the hainous nature of this Sin, that <HI>it is no light thing to break the second Commandment.</HI> These are the Reasons of the point, I conclude with a few words of Use.</P>
<P>Use I. <HI>This Doctrine Condemns and cashieres at once all the Ceremo|nies, and whatever other Inventions of men have been introduced into the wor|ship of God by the Spirit of Anti-Christ, and reteined, and continued by some reforming Magistrates, who have made but incompleat and imper|fect Reformations.</HI> As who knows not, that almost all the Ordinances of Christ have been polluted and corrupted by them. The Gospel might not be preached without a Surplice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the second Sermon</NOTE> nor Baptisme administred without the sign of the Cross, So likewise kneeling at the Sacrament, bowing to the Altar, and to the name Jesus, Popish holy dayes, holiness of places, Organs and Cathedral Musick, The Books of Common prayer, Prelacy or Church Government by Bishops. These things are no better then this brazen Serpent was. And therefore if this was a <HI>Nehushtan,</HI> so are all these. They are nothing else but <HI>reliques of Popery</HI> and <HI>remnants of</HI> Baal, and therefore when the Kingdome of Christ is come, they shall perish from off the Earth, and from under these Heavens.</P>
<P>Vse II. <HI>Direction to Rulers and Magistrates, and to you all in your prayers for them,</HI> Let Magistrates imitate this Example of <HI>Hezekiab.</HI> It should awaken them to their Duty. <HI>Be wise now therefore, O ye Rulers, be instructed O ye judges of the Earth, and</HI> know, that it is your duty to


<PB N="26" REF="000151_0031_0FA2B7F778F329A0">
promote the purity of Gods worship, and to protect his people and Messengers, It is a thing impossible to keep in with both sides, both with Persecutors and Sufferers, but therefore it will be your wisdom, and the best and safest way to be on Gods side, and let <HI>Baal plead for himself.</HI> But because I see but few of them here, I shall direct my speech only to the people of God here present, you may see from hence, what Pray|ers to make, and what Requests to put up for those whom God by his Providence hath set in Authority over you, pray that God would give them reforming Spirits; and for the King, that God would make Him another <HI>Hezekiah</HI> to remove the High places, and to cut off the rem|nants of <HI>Baal,</HI> that he may trust in the Lord, and keep close to his Word; and that the Lord would be with him, and prosper him whithersoever he goeth, as he will certainly do in this way of Integrity to Religion, and to the work of Reformation.</P>
<P>Use III. <HI>I Conclude with that word of Exhortation wherewith the Apostle John concludes his first Epistle, Little Children keep your selves from Idols, Amen.</HI> 1 Joh. 5. <HI>ult.</HI> And it is <HI>Pauls</HI> Exhortation also, <HI>1 Cor.</HI> 10.14. <HI>wherefore my dearly Beloved, flee from Idolatry.</HI> Remember what you heard in the Reasons of the point concerning the greatness of this Sin, and how jealous, and severe the Lord is against these violations of the Second Commandment, and Consider also these four words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It hath been the great design of Satan in all times, and Ages, to destroy and to corrupt the worship of God.</HI> And if he cannot perswade men to be down right Athiests, he labours then to drive them into the other ex|tream of Superstition, if he cannot prevail with them to cast of all the worship of God altogether, then he tempts them to worship him in a wrong way, to worship the true God Superstitiously. What was the great sin amongst the Jews? was it not this? so likewise amongst the old Heathens and Pagans, and amongst the Papists at this day. And what is the great design and work of Christ at this day? but to bring forth his worship into purity, that the new <HI>Jerusalem</HI> may come down from Hea|ven; This therefore Satan is most industrious to countermine and fight against, Therefore be sober, be vigilant against this Sin, because your Adversary the Devil is so watchful to insnare you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will be varnisht over with fair colours, and plausible pretences.</HI> The whore of <HI>Babylon</HI> gives the wine of the filthiness of her Fornication in a golden cup, <HI>Rev. 17.4.</HI> The Devil in his actings against the Church in the Times of the new Testament, He did appear at first almost like himself in the shape of a great <HI>red Dragon,</HI> in <HI>the Roman Pagan Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> But when <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels overcame, and overthrew

For he hath made it his buisiness, ever since the time of <HI>Constantine</HI> to revive the old Heathenish Idolarry under other names, that whereas before they worshipped the Devil under the names of <HI>Jupi|ter and Apollo,</HI> now they commit the same Idolatry, &amp; worship the same Devil still, but under the names of Popish Saints; now it is not <HI>Jupiter and Apollo</HI> any more, but <HI>Saint Peter, and the Virgin Mary,</HI> and the <HI>Vicar of Christ,</HI> &amp; the <HI>holy Catholick Church of</HI> Rome. Thus doth that Harlot paint her face: So the <HI>Prelatick Superstitions</HI> at this day are painted over with those glozing pretences of <HI>Antiquity, Fathers, Councils, Order, De|cency, Edification, the peace of the Church,</HI> and such like.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If once you begin in a way of Superstition, you will never know where to stop or stay,</HI> nor where to make an end, but you will multiply your Idols, and increase your Altars, and grow worse and worse. For <HI>evil men and Seducers shall wax worse and worse.</HI> It is the nature of all sin, but of this in a especial manner, as it is in bodily uncleanness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2 Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 3.13&punc;</HI></NOTE> when men are given up to that lust, they are insatiable, and work all uncleanness with greediness, so it is in this sin of spiritual Whoredome, it is an end|less sin. If you do but wear a Surplice for peace sake, why not as well admit the sign of the Cross in Baptism, or bow to an Altar, and in a lit|tle time you will find that the same Reason is as strong for bowing to an Image, to a Crucifix, and why not as well say Mass too, for the peace of the Church, and then at last swallow down every thing, Submit to the Pope, worship the Beast, and so be damned and go to Hell, and all for the peace of the Church. Oh! there is no end here, when a man is once going down the Hill in a way of Carnal Complyance and Superstition, he will never cease; but like a man that is tumbling down a steep Hill, cannot stop, till he come to the bottom, to the very bottom of the pit of Popery. All the abominations of Anti-Christ came in by degrees, the four first trumpets were so many steps or degrees of the rise of Anti-Christ, and then in the fifth, he appears upon his Throne with open face, as the Angel of the bottomless pit, and as an <HI>Abaddon,</HI> as a de|stroyer and Son of perdition, with all his <HI>Frogs and locusts</HI> about him, with all that Anti-Christian <HI>Popish Clergy,</HI> acting under him and for him, <HI>Rev. Chap. 8. Chap. 9.</HI> It is observed in the Histories of the Ido|latrous Kings of Israel, that those in succeeding Times were worse then their wicked Predecessours: <HI>Ieroboam</HI> he that made <HI>Israel</HI> to sin, He did but <HI>set up the two Calves at Dan and Bethel,</HI> but <HI>Omri</HI> went beyond him,


<PB N="28" REF="000151_0033_0FA2B7F949BC14A8">
for it is said, He did worse then all that went before him, <HI>1 King 16.25.</HI> we read of <HI>the Statutes of</HI> Omri, <HI>Mica. 6.16.</HI> so that <HI>Omri</HI> did enact, and establish Iniquity and Idolatry by a Law; But his Son <HI>Aha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was worse then He, for as <HI>if it had been a light thing for Him to walk in the Sins of</HI> Jeroboam, <HI>he did set up all the worship of</HI> Baal, <HI>1 King. 16 30, 31, 32, 33.</HI> Hence the faithful Servants of the Lord have been exceeding wary and watchful against the least appearances and beginnings of Ido|latry. One of the Ancients (<HI>Basil</HI> as I remember) when the Heathen Ido|laters had put Incense into his Hand, and offered to spare his life, if he would but throw it in, or let it fall into the Censer, he chose rather to burn&punc; his Hand and loose his life, then to Commit that seeming little sin; which brings me to a fourth Consideration.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Remember this for ever, that it is better to suffer then to sin.</HI> A man had better suffer, better dye, then sin. And therefore if Superstition be a Sin, be wise for your selves, and choose the greatest affliction, rather then the least Sin. Thou that sayest in thy heart, life is sweet, and thou art loth to suffer, loth to dye; I tell thee, It were better for thee to be cast into prison, into the deepest-darkest-Dungeon. It were better for thee to be burnt at a Stake, or to be hanged upon a Tree, then to sin a|gainst thy Conscience. <HI>Hooper</HI> that blessed <HI>Martyr</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 3.</NOTE> when one as|saulted him with this Temptation, <HI>death is bitter, life is sweet,</HI> He repli|ed, <HI>but death eternal is more bitttr, and life Eternal is more sweet.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Suppose the worst that can be supposed, Suppose that sad time of staying the witnesses be not yet accomplished,</HI> as indeed it is a great Con|troversy, one of the greatest in this Book, whether it be, or no; it is the judgement of very great Interpreters, that it is past, but Suppose there be some further accomplishment of it yet behind, as it may be hopefully conceived that it shall not be so great a slaughter as the first, and that the rage of the Anti-Christian party shall not be able to prevail and proceed so farre as then it did, for the Kingdom of Anti-Christ is decaying, and the Kingdom of Christ is rising; So it is certain, that the time will not be long, for it shall be but <HI>three dayes and an half,</HI> Rev. 11.11. Let the <HI>Prelates and Prelatick Persecutours,</HI> take notice of it, suppose you should prevail for a time, and suppose Prelacy should get up again, yet it will not be able to stand, but after three dayes and an half, that is to say, after a little short time, it will fall and perish. <HI>The Lord will then cast you forth again, and that for ever, so as to make a full end of you!</HI> And therefore let the people of God bear up, and be encouraged in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord, for <HI>the Lord will speedily arise, and have mercy upon Sion</HI>; the King|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om of Christ is coming, and the wheels of his Chariots hasten, he will

<P>FIrst for general Arguments&punc; waving many other things, my Text leads me to insist chiefly upon this, that <HI>they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re Idols against the Se|cond Commandment</HI>: They are not directly and immediately against the First, for they are used as means whereby to honour and worship God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, but there may be a <HI>false worship</HI> offer|ed up to the true God, and that the Ceremonyes are such, that they are Idols against the Second Commandment, these Reasons do evince.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because they are means of worship which the Lord never appointed, and which never came into his heart.</HI> There is no stamp of God upon them, no stamp of Institution, But God will say of them at the great day, who required these things at your Hands. They are means of wor|ship of an High Nature, for they have a great part of the nature of Sa|craments in them, For the Patrons of them say, <HI>they are neither dead nor dumb, but mystical and significant, and appointed on purpose to stir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty towards God, by some special and notable signification, whereby He may be edified,</HI> they are the words of the preface to the <HI>Common prayer Book.</HI> So that as the <HI>Sacra|ments</HI> have two parts, <HI>an outward sign, and the inward grace signified</HI> thereby, So have the <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> The <HI>Surplice</HI> signifies the whiteness of purity and Innocency that should be in Ministers: The <HI>Sign of the Cross</HI> signifieth that they must not be ashamed of the Cross of Christ, and so all the rest have some pretended spiritual signification annexed to them, yea they are not only pretended to be <HI>significative,</HI> but <HI>affective</HI> also, <HI>to edify, to stir up a dull and dead heart,</HI> &amp;c. which brings to mind that strange Answer in the Catechism of the Common prayer, to that Question? <HI>How many Sacraments there be,</HI> They Answer, <HI>two only, as gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly necessary to Salvation,</HI> viz. <HI>Baptisme and the Lords Supper</HI>; Implying, that there be other Sacraments also, though not so necessary, which must either relate to <HI>the seven popish Sacraments,</HI> or else to these <HI>English Popish Ceremonies,</HI> but they are such Sacraments as Christ is not the Author of, <HI>Sacraments of mans making,</HI> for the greatest Patrons and promoters of them, do not pretend a divine Institution for them, but on|ly the Authority of the Church, but if the Second Commandment was given to the Church, as I hope they will not deny, thou shalt not make any <HI>graven Image,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>form of worship</HI> to thy self, they are a manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> breach of that Commandment.</P>

And at a Metrapolitical Visitation in <HI>Lancashire</HI> in the time of the Bi|shops, when Complaint was made to <HI>Cousins</HI> the <HI>Visitor</HI> against a godly Minister, that he had never worn a Surplice in all his life; the <HI>Visitor</HI> swore, it had been better for Him to have got seven Bastards, and so pro|ceeded accordingly to silence him, which yet was an orderly and Cano|nical way of proceeding: and very just and moderate, for it is enacted in the Canons of 1603. <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Canon</NOTE> <HI>that whosoever shall but declare his differ|ence in judgement from the Prelates in these things, shall be excommunica|ted ipso facto</HI>; but I need not Insist here, for these Nations have had plentiful and woful experience of it, and it is known to all the world, that these wretched Ceremonies have been the principal Engines and Instruments of Persecution in the Hand of Satan to stop the mouths of Gods faithful Messengers, and to oppress the Witnesses, and obstruct the work of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are Idols, because monuments of former Idolatry.</HI> As the bra|zen Serpent here, might not <HI>Hezekiah</HI> have prohibited the burning In|cense to it, but retained the thing it self, and have pleaded, though it was an Idol, yet it is none now; as our <HI>Formalists</HI> use to plead for these old po|pish Ceremonies? no, for God will <HI>cut off the Remnants of Baal</HI> from this place, the very <HI>reliques of Popery,</HI> Zeph. 1.4. Although some of these things have formerly been of use in the worship of God by his own Ap|pointment, as the brazen Serpent was, <HI>and lights, oyle, musical Instru|ments, holy garments for the Priests</HI> under the Levitical Law, yet now the stamp of Institution being taken off, and having been the <HI>Idols</HI> of the Papists, they are <HI>Nehushtans, base things.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is a Symbolizing with Idolaters, amongst whom these abominati|ons are continued unto this day.</HI> But this is frequently and severely for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idden in the Scripture: <HI>after the doings of the Land of Egypt, wherein

And shall we then do like the <HI>Papists</HI>? there is the same Reason as to this matter of <HI>Popish Idolatries,</HI> as there is of <HI>Heathenish.</HI> The Lord will have his people to have no Com|munication with <HI>Rome</HI> at all, whatsoever our <HI>Popish Prelates</HI> may pretend for Union, and Reconciliation with her. The Lord hath said, <HI>If any man worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his mark in his Fore-head, or in his Hand, that man shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,</HI> Rev. 14 9, 10.</P>
<P>The Argument doth not depend upon this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> neither doth the Question turn upon this Hinge, whether Popery be the worst or grossest kind of Idolatry, but whether it be Idolatry at all; For we must not com|municate, nor Symbolize with any kind of Idolaters whatsoever. Nei|ther is it fit to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">use and extenuate the Idolatry of the <HI>Papists,</HI> as the Bi|shops usually do in their pleadings for the <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> For though it may seem in some respects not so bad as the Heathenish, yet in other respects it is worse, and I find that our Divines generally do so judge of it; as <HI>Par|ker,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> <HI>Ames</HI> have shewed at la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, and amongst our Divines in this point (saith <HI>Ames</HI>) we may reckon De <HI>Iackson</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> himself, who hath a Chapter of the Identity, or Equivalency of Superstition in <HI>Rome,</HI> Hea|then, and <HI>Rome</HI> Christians.

<HEAD>I. The Surplice.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Surplice</HI> with all the rest of that Popish Wardrope of Superstiti|ous garments, <HI>Hoods, Tippets, Rochets,</HI> &amp;c. For there is the same Reason of them all, they are all Popish Idols, and ancient wayes of Su|perstition. For if you look into the story of <HI>Jehu,</HI> you will find that the <HI>Priests of</HI> Baal had their <HI>Superstitious garments</HI> in those times, <HI>2 Kin. 10.22.</HI> and <HI>he said unto Him that was over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">estry, bring forth the vest|ments,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pag <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>for the worshippers of</HI> Baal. And amongst the Papists, the <HI>Surplice</HI> as some have well observed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 28</NOTE> hath been such a <HI>master Idol,</HI> that it sancti|fieth as it were all their other Idols; So that without this it is unlawful for them to Officiate. The Lord indeed appointed holy garments for the Priests under the Law, but if the Lord had not appointed them, it had been a sinful and a foolish thing to use them, and therefore it is said of <HI>Gideons Ephod,</HI> which as it seemeth, was made in imitation of the high Priests garments, that <HI>Israel went a whoring after it, and it became a snare to</HI> Gideon <HI>and to his House,</HI> Judg. 8.27 An Ephod is nothing else but a garment made partly of Linnen, not unlike a Surplice, but more rich and costly. Those garments of <HI>Aaron,</HI> are said to be for glory, and for beau|ty, <HI>Exod. 28.2.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> 28 2</NOTE> Because they typified and shadowed out the beauty of Christ, our true high Priest, in all those glorious graces of the Spirit of holiness in him. But when the Sun ariseth, the shadows fly away, and therefore now that Christ the body is come, and that Sun of Righteous|ness arisen upon the World, those legal shadows are done away&punc; and to retain them in these Times of the New Testament, doth interpretatively deny that Christ is come in the flesh, and therefore there should be no difference between the garments of Ministers in their holy ministrations, and the garments of other persons, or of themselves at other times, but they shovld go in their habit according to the grave and Comely man|ner of those among whom they live. All the hint the Scripture gives con|cerning Ministers apparrel, is only in that word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tim.</HI> 3.<HI>2.</HI> which implies, that they should be comely, but not the least hint of any different Ceremonious garments to know them by, from other men.

But how may that be proved that it is a sin? why thus. To do any thing in the worship of God that is not decent is a sin, for the Rule is express, <HI>1 Cor. 1.4. ult. Let all things be done decently and in or|der,</HI> but to wear <HI>a fools Coat</HI> is not decent, but ridiculous; therefore it is a sin to do it in the worship of God, and much more to wear <HI>a Surplice,</HI>


<PB N="38" REF="000151_0043_0FA2B801D2F89CF8">
which is fitly called a fools Coat indeed, being as bad, yea, worse. For a fools Coat is only a breach of the rule of decency, but a Surplice is both ridiculous and Superstitious too, It is both a breach of the rule of decency and of the second Commandment, and therefore it is worse then a fools Coat. But we are not to break the least Command for the greatest good&punc; And such Ministers as are silenced upon this account, it is not they that do forsake their Ministry, as is most unchristianly and reproachfully said by some, but they are forced from it, and are driven into Corners by plain force and violence. For if men will not suffer us to preach but upon such hard Conditions, that we must break Rules, and Sin against our Consci|ences if we will preach, it is all one as if they should absolutely hinder, for we must not purchase the liberty of our Ministry at such a dear price, though it be such a precious Ordinance, and so great a mercy to enjoy it. <HI>A man had better never preach a Sermon all his dayes then part with a good Conscience for it.</HI></P>
<P>And it is not only a few <HI>Puritans</HI> or <HI>Fanaticks</HI> as they are now term|ed, that are so nice and so precise, as to dislike the wearing of a Surplice.

<HEAD>VI. Popish Holy Dayes.</HEAD>
<P>THese are another <HI>Idol</HI> of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> For no|thing can be holy to the Lord, which is not made holy by the Lord. It was a part of the Pharisees Superstition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o fast twice a week, <HI>Luk. 18.12.</HI> and it was the brand set upon <HI>Ieroboam, 1 King. 12 33.</HI> that <HI>he ordained a Feast unto the Children of Israel, upon the fifteenth day of the eighth Moneth, even the Moneth which he had devised of his own Heart.</HI> And though it was like un|to the Feast that was in <HI>Iudah,</HI> ver. 32. and though He pretended the glory and worship of that God that brought them up out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as well as the ease and accomodation of the people, <HI>ver. 28.</HI> yet all this would not excuse Him, And what is <HI>Christmas and

Easther,</HI> and all the rest of them, but dayes, which the <HI>Ieroboam of</HI> Rome hath devised of his own Heart? And the people had them from the <HI>Pagans,</HI> for <HI>Christmas</HI> is nothing else but the old Heathenish <HI>Ba|chanalia,</HI> it is kept at the same time of the year, and after the same profane manner only the <HI>Pope</HI> hath <HI>Christened</HI> it with a new name.</P>
<P>The Apostle condems the observation of the <HI>Iewish Festivals,</HI> be|cause they were <HI>a shadow of good things to come,</HI> Col. 2.16. such weak and rudimentary Instructions were fit for those darker and weaker Times of the Churches nonage, when under the Tutorage and paeda|gogy of <HI>Moses,</HI> before the coming of Christ. <HI>But after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggerly Elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage, ye observe dayes and Moneths, and Times, and Years. I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain,</HI> Gal. 4.9, 10, 11. It is a Sign the preaching of the Gospel hath had but small success in such a place, and in the Hearts of such a people, and if the Apostle said it concern|ing <HI>Iewish dayes,</HI> surely it is much more true concerning <HI>Popish dayes,</HI> for there was more Reason to retain those which were appointed at first by God himself, then to observe those which were invented by the Pope, and which have done so much mischief to the Churches of Christ. For as <HI>Dr. Ames</HI> observs, <HI>they were from their first rise not only equalled unto, but also extolled above the Lords day. Easther</HI> brought in a Superstitious Lent to attend upon it, made <HI>Baptism</HI> wait for Her <HI>Moon,</HI> and conformed our <HI>Lords Supper</HI> unto the <HI>Iewish Passover</HI> in unleavened bread. It was the first apple of Contention amongst Chri|stians, the Latine and Greek Churches striving and contending fierce|ly about the time of it, <HI>de lan&acirc; caprin&acirc;,</HI> and <HI>Victor</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> des|perately excommunicating those that were not of his op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nion in the thing, so that it was the first weapon wherewith the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> plaid his prizes against other Churches, and after slew so many <HI>per|sons</HI> with, by <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monke. Holy dayes devised by men in honour of Christ, invited and drew on Holy dayes to Saints. Though indeed it is but a vain pretence to say, they do it in honour of Christ, for it is not good Intentions that will excuse bad actions. <HI>Ieroboam</HI> pretended very good Intentions, The Israelites pretended <HI>an holy-day to Iehovah,</HI> Exod, 32.5. though they kept it in a rude man|ner but what saith the Lord to them, even after all the prayers of <HI>Mo|ses</HI> for them, <HI>ver. 34. in the day when</HI> I <HI>visit,</HI> I <HI>will visit their sin upon them.</HI></P>
<P>

<PB N="57" REF="000151_0062_0FA2B811C036E6B0">These dayes are rather celebrated in dishonour, and as it were in despite of <HI>Christ,</HI> as if Christ were a God that delighted in Profane|ness and Wickedness: for he is dishonoured by letting the reins loose to all manner of Profaneness, as much in the <HI>Twelve dayes,</HI> and in some respects more, then in all the <HI>Twelve Moneths</HI> of the year be|side. And it is <HI>a dishonour to his Sabbath,</HI> for men to set their Posts by his Posts, and their Altars by his Altars, as <HI>Jeroboam devised a Feast of his own heart, like unto the Feast that was in Judah.</HI> Suppose the Church might sanctifie a day where the Lord hath not done it, yet it is needless and superfluous, yea presumptuous to do it, where the Lord hath made other provision, for it is to charge God with folly. But Christ the Lord of Time, and the Lord of the Sabbath, hath san|ctified and instituted the first day of the week, whereon he arose from the dead, for the Commemoration of the great work of our Re|demption by him. And <HI>what can the man do that cometh after the King? and in those things which have been already done?</HI> Eccles. 2.12. It is a bold and deep <HI>reflection upon the wisdome of Christ,</HI> to adde thus to his Appointments, as if the Lord Jesus Christ himself were not wise enough, to appoint dayes and times sufficient to keep his own Nati|vity, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and all the great things he hath done for us, in everlasting remembrance in the hearts of his Saints, but the Devil and the Pope must help it out. <HI>Neither is the yearly time certainly known,</HI> but much disputed amongst Chronologers and Di|vines, so that <HI>Holy-day keepers</HI> cannot say that they do commemorate <HI>opus diti in die suo,</HI> the Lord having hid it, as he did the body of <HI>Mo|ses,</HI> to prevent Idolatry.</P>
<P>And it is a great infringement of our Christian Liberty, when God hath given us six dayes wherein to serve him in our Callings, <HI>Six dayes shalt thou labour.</HI> As it is Profaneness to call that common which God hath sanctified and made holy; so it is <HI>Tyrannical Superstition and Pre|sumption</HI> to make that holy which God hath made common. <HI>Occasional dayes</HI> of Humiliation and Thanksgiving, when God by his Providence calls thereunto, there is <HI>Scripture-ground</HI> and warrant for: for, <HI>Je|hoshaphat proclaimed a Fast,</HI> 2 Chron. 20.3. and so did the King of <HI>Nineveh, Jonah</HI> 3.7. see also <HI>Joel</HI> 1.14. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2.15. From whence some have not unaptly said, That the Magistrate and the Church hath as it were <HI>a Warrant dormant</HI> for such dayes. Neither indeed could all the particular Causes, and Occasions, and Times thereof be particularly determined in the Scripture, because they are infinite, and Christ al|lows also private Fasts, <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.17, 18. but here there is onely an

occasional designation of a time, upon a present emergency of Pro|vidence calling thereunto. But in those <HI>Anniversary Popish Festivals</HI> time is dedicated and sanctified to an holy use in a <HI>stated way,</HI> which is more then the Scripture impowers men to do. So for Week-day-Lectures, they are most impertinently objected, for these are not hours sanctified or consecrated to Gods service, but onely the most convenient times when most may resort to the hearing of Sermons. So that time is onely <HI>designed occasionally, not dedicate or sanctified.</HI> Time is made to serve Gods people, and not Gods people made to serve the time, or to serve God because it is an holy time.</P>
<P>And whereas some have seemed to condemn the superstitious part of Christmas, but plead hard for the <HI>Hospitable part,</HI> as they call it: The Answer is, That the <HI>Feasting and Sporting is an Appendix to the Worship,</HI> or rather to the Superstition, and therefore stands or falls together with it. The Apostle therefore calls them Idolaters, even for their Feasting and Sporting, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.7. <HI>Neither be ye Idolaters, as were some of them: as it is written, The people sate down to eat, and drink, and rose up to play.</HI> And if you reade the story of that Idola|try of the Calf, <HI>Exod.</HI> 52. you will finde that it was Celebrated much after the same manner that <HI>Christmas</HI> is, or rather somewhat better; for <HI>they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings:</HI> So that it seems they went to Church, and said their Prayers most devoutly in the morning, and then <HI>they sate down to eat and drink, and rose up to play,</HI> ver. 6. <HI>and there was shout|ing, and singing, and dancing amongst them,</HI> ver. 18, 19. Sober mirth, and the moderate use of the good Creatures of God, is lawful at any time of the year, and there never was any Minister that Preached or spake against that; but to have better Cheer upon a Popish Holy-day, then at another time, meerly upon this account, because forsooth it is an <HI>Holy-day,</HI> this is superstitious: and the Revelling, and Rioting, and Luxury which is usual at those times, is every way an hinderance to Hospitality, and not a furtherance to it, that which might and ought to be bestowed in a way of Liberality to the Poor, being mis-spent and lavished away in vain Prodigality and Luxury.</P>
<P>The dayes of <HI>Purim, Esth.</HI> 9. were seven hundred years since ob|jected by Papists unto the <HI>Waldenses,</HI> and since by all Papists that have written against Protestants about Ceremonies, as <HI>Gregonius de Valen|tia, Bellarmine, Suarez</HI>; and we need not seek for new Answers about it, for that which our Divines have answered to the Papists, is suffici|ent in two words. 1. <HI>That it cannot be evinced, that these dayes of</HI>

<HEAD>VII. Holiness of Places, or Consecrating of Churches&punc;</HEAD>
<P>TO discover the vanity of this <HI>Superstition,</HI> consider, that <HI>inherent Holiness</HI> which is in Persons, is a thing which Places are no way capable of: but the onely holiness that is or can be pretended for them, is a <HI>Relative Holiness,</HI> upon the account of some thing without them, in respect and relation whereto, they are denominated and re|puted holy. Hence one that writes for it hath described it thus, <HI>A state of Relation of Peculiarity to Godwards.</HI> Now in the time of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> we finde two sorts of holy Places upon this account of Relation to the holy God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Where God was pleased to afford the visible and extraordinary Ap|pearances and Manifestations of his Glory to the very eyes of his Ser|vants, such Places were Holy during the time of those Manifestations.</HI> As when the Lord appeared to <HI>Moses</HI> in the burning Bush, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.5. <HI>The place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</HI> So to <HI>Joshua, Chap.</HI> 5.15. Hence Mount Sinai <HI>might not be touched,</HI> Exod. 19. And upon this ac|count the Mount where Christ was transfigured is called the <HI>Holy Mount,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.18. but this Holiness continued onely while that <HI>ex|traordinary Presence</HI> continued, there is no more Holiness in <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> or in <HI>Mount Tabor</HI> now, then there is in any other place, therefore the Apostle so calls it from what it was, not that it is so still; neither is any other place in these times priviledged with such an ex|traordinary visible Presence and Appearance of God: and therefore this neither is nor can be pretended for our Meeting-places. But</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There was a stated Holiness in the time of the Law in some Places.</HI> And thus some have observed, that we finde but three Places that were holy in this respect, <HI>The Land of Canaan,</HI> called <HI>the holy Land,</HI> Zech. 2.12. the City of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> called <HI>the holy City,</HI> Mat. 5.4. &amp; 27.53. and <HI>the Temple,</HI> frequently therefore called <HI>the holy Temple,</HI> Jonah 2.4. And these places were perpetually holy, as long as the Old Testament dispensation continued. But if we enquire into the nature, and into the grounds and reasons of this Holiness, we shall finde that it is wholly ceased in these Gospel-times, and that no place is holy now up|on any such account. For</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>These Places were holy, because in them were the standing Signs and Symbols of Gods Presence,</HI> which is therefore called his <HI>Symbolical


<PB N="61" REF="000151_0066_0FA2B815932A2C78">
Presence,</HI> to distinguish it from his <HI>Extraordinary Presence</HI> before-mentioned, and from his <HI>Spiritual Presence,</HI> which is not tyed to any place. Hence he is said to choose <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> and the <HI>Temple,</HI> to dwell there, and to put his Name there, <HI>Psal.</HI> 76.2. <HI>&amp;</HI> 87&punc; 2. and to dwell between the Cherubims, <HI>Psal.</HI> 80.1. The Temple it self was a Sign of his Presence, and the Altar, the Ark, the Mercy-seat, Cherubims, Sacrifices, and almost all the Ordinances of those times were affixed by Gods appointment unto those places, to be observed and celebrated there, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>Temple,</HI> and in <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> but there is no place that is now priviledged with this Symbolical Presence. There are no such standing Signs and tokens of his Presence annexed unto any place. God hath given his Ordinances to his Church, but he hath not tyed them to any place, <HI>He dwells not in Temples made with hands,</HI> Acts 17.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>These places under the Law were holy, by reason of their Typical respect to Christ, and the good things that were to come by him. Canaan</HI> the holy Land was a Type of the Church on Earth, and of the King|dome of Heaven, the heavenly <HI>Canaan: They sought another Country, a better Country, that is, an heavenly,</HI> Heb. 11.14, 16. <HI>Thine eyes shall see the land that is very far off,</HI> Isa. 33.17. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> also was a Type of the Church, and of <HI>Jerusalem above,</HI> Gal. 4.26. Rev. 21.2. and so the Temple, <HI>Psal.</HI> 15.1. and it was a Type also of Christs Body, <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.21. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.9. Hence some have well observed, That <HI>the more nearly and lively that any of these Places did typifie Christ, so the diffe|rence and degree of holiness did arise</HI>; as the Temple was more holy, because it typified the Body of Christ, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, <HI>Coloss.</HI> 2.9. as God did dwell Symbolically in the Temple. But Christ the Substance being come, and all the Types and Shadows therefore done away, there are not, there cannot be typical Places, or typical Holiness in Places in these times.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Those Places of old were holy by virtue of Gods Institution, who did appoint and sanctifie them to be parts of his Worship, and Ordinances of a very high nature</HI>; for the Lord appointed them to be the wayes and means of Communion between himself and his people: <HI>There will I meet thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy-seat, from between the two Cherubims, which are upon the Ark of the Testimony,</HI> Exod. 25.22. Numb. 7.89. And they did sanctifie both the Worshippers, and the Worship performed in them, the Altar sancti|fied the gift, the Temple sanctified the gold, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.18, 19. in so much that the Places were principal, and the Duties less princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pal, as


<PB N="62" REF="000151_0067_0FA2B8185E564BE0">
Divines observe. The Temple and the Altar being Types of Christ, were of an higher worth and excellency then the Services and Sacri|fices offered in them, and did bring acceptance to them, and there|fore they were to pray towards the Temple, to offer upon the Altar, <HI>&amp;c. Deut</HI> 12.5, 6. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8.29. <HI>There will I accept them,</HI> Ezek 20.40. And it was a profaning of the Temple to use it for Civil Im|ployments, being consecrated and appropriated by God to holy uses: and therefore Christ would not suffer them to buy or sell, or to carry vessels through it, <HI>Mark</HI> 11.15, 16.</P>
<P>But <HI>there is no word of Institution in the New Testament to sanctifie any one Place more then another,</HI> but on the contrary it layes all places level in regard of Holiness. When the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> pleaded, <HI>Our fathers worshipped in this Mountain, but ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship; Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, The hour cometh, and now is, when ye shall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father, but the true wor|shippers shall worship him in spirit and in truth,</HI> Joh. 4.21, 23. He turns her eyes and thoughts away from the difference of Places, to look at the spirituality of the worship: for as God is no <HI>respecter of persons,</HI> so he is no <HI>respecter of places</HI>; but wheresoever, for that indefinite [<HI>where</HI>] is equivalent to an universal, <HI>Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them,</HI> Matth. 18.20. <HI>I will that men pray every where, <GAP DESC="foreign">, in every place,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.8. The Church of <HI>Troas</HI> met in an upper Chamber to break Bread, and for Preaching and other Ordinances, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.8. there|fore all places are alike.</P>
<P><HI>Our publick Meeting-places</HI> for Worship in these Gospel-times, do not succeed in the stead of the Jewish Tabernacle or Temple, because they are not priviledged with that extraordinary visible Presence of God in them, which was in the Temple at some times, neither have they that Symbolical Presence, and residence of God in them, which was in the Temple at all times, neither have they that typical respect to Christ, neither hath God sanctified them, and set them apart to himself as his own peculiar: but they <HI>are of the same nature with the Jewish Synagogues,</HI> which were the places of the publick Moral Wor|ship of God in those times, and were without question every whit as holy as our Churches, but yet we finde that the Synagogues were not appropriated to holy uses onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. 10 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7. Matt 13.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> though the Temple was, but they kept Courts, and had Civil Assemblies in them about Civil mat|ters, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.34. <HI>Some of them shall you scourge in your Synagogues,</HI>

which suppose it were not meant of the executing and inflicting of the punishment upon them, but onely as some would have it, of passing the Sentence, yet this will not help them, for still it was a Civil and Secular use of the place, where they met for the publick Worship of God.</P>
<P>I may therefore here apply that of <HI>Isai.</HI> 27.9. <HI>By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin: when he maketh all the stones of the Altar as chalk-stones, that are beaten asunder, the Groves and Images shall not stand up.</HI> God will never purge away the iniquity of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor take away the sins of <HI>England,</HI> till the stones of the Altar be as Chalk-stones, till people be convinced that there is no more holiness in <HI>a Church,</HI> I mean <HI>the Meeting-place</HI> of Wood and Stones, then in a dwelling house, nor in an Altar more then in Chalk-stones. There have been some <HI>Episcopal men,</HI> Episcopal at least in some other things, who yet have been much above this gross superstitious Conceit of the difference of Places. Dr. <HI>Vsher</HI> in his <HI>Body of Divinity,</HI> speaking against the private Admi|nistration of the Sacraments, he hath these words; <HI>In times of Per|secution the godly did often meet in Barns, and such obscure places, which were indeed publick, because of the Church of God there, the House or Place availing nothing to make it publick or private, even as where|soever the Prince is, there is the Court, although it were in a poor Cot|tage.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, there is a Spiritual Presence of God in our publick Meet|ing-places, when his people are there assembled to <HI>Worship him in the Beauties of Holiness,</HI> but he doth not afford his Presence with respect to the place, but to the persons; he is not present with them for the places sake, but present in the place at that time for their sakes. And therefore this Spiritual Presence of God doth not make any place properly holy, for then all places should be holy, wheresoever holy persons meet to enjoy the Spiritual Presence of God in holy duties: as the Primitive Churches met in private Chambers, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.13. <HI>&amp;</HI> 20.8. and by the same reason all the dwelling-houses where there are Family-duties, and daily worshipping of God in the Family, and in secret, are holy places also. Nay, the Fields, the Streets, and some|times Prisons, and Dungeons, and Gibbets, and all places where the Saints come, and enjoy Communion with God in their Spirits, are holy places. And so by their own Argument they lay all places level, the Lord having many precious Saints that walk with him, who are dispersed &amp; scattered up and down almost in every corner of the Land.</P>
<P>

<PB N="64" REF="000151_0069_0FA2B81AD4331CB0"><HI>Churches</HI> I confess are <HI>holy things,</HI> but the word <HI>Church</HI> is very im|properly, and <HI>Catachrestically</HI> used concerning the <HI>Material Church</HI> of Wood and Stones, by a <HI>Metonymie</HI>; but the Scripture knows no other Church but the <HI>Church of Saints.</HI> That place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.22. is much abused, and misinterpreted, <HI>Have you not houses of your own to eat and drink in? or despise you the Church of God?</HI> It is not meant of those improper <HI>Metonymical Churches,</HI> neither doth the opposi|tion inforce any such thing: for there be many other things which may be opposed to their own houses, besides the publick Meeting-place. There are in <HI>Logick</HI> not onely <HI>Contraria, quorum unum uni,</HI> but also <HI>Disparata quorum unum multis pariter opponitur:</HI> The Apostles Argument is this, that it is a contempt of the Church or Saints of God, to carry themselves so disorderly in their presence.</P>
<P>And yet it doth not follow, that the publick Meeting-places must be pulled down, for the Consecrating of them is an abuse of things necessary, and not of things indifferent. The Scripture mentions it as a good work to build them, <HI>He loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Synagogue,</HI> Luke 7.5. and as an act of great profaneness to pull them down, <HI>Psal.</HI> 74.8. <HI>They have burnt up all the Synagogues of God in the Land,</HI> which yet had no more holiness in them then our Meet|ing-places. And the thing it self speaks, for if there ought to be publick Assemblies for the Worship of God, if this be a duty, it is necessary that there be places to meet in. It is true, the Lord com|manded the Jews to demolish the Heathen Temples of the <HI>Canaanites, Deut.</HI> 12.2, 3. but these were built for Idols, and therefore might just|ly be accounted meer Monuments of Idolatry; but our Meeting-places were built for Christian Churches and Assemblies to Worship God in, amongst whom <HI>the Essentials of a Church-estate</HI> and Worship were preserved, even under <HI>the Apostacy of Antichrist,</HI> for the Woman was fed &amp; nourished all the 1260 dayes, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.6, 14. therefore som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fundamental Ordinances were preserved, though both the Worship and the Places have been much defiled with Superstition: but yet as we do not therefore reject the Worship of God, because of those Abuses, so neither need we reject the Places, but should reform and retain both the one and the other, the Worship and Ordinances be|ing necessary by virtue of Gods Institution, and the Places needful for the performance of the Worship.

subject to such Pollution by any Superstition formerly used, and now laid aside, as may render it unlawful or inconvenient for Christians to meet together therein for the publick Worship of God; and therefore we hold it requisite, that the places of publick Assembling for Worship amongst us, should be continued, and employed to that use.</HI> Neither indeed can they be destroyed without great and manifest hinderance and preju|dice to the publick Worship of God, unless new ones be first built.

<P>IT is true, they had <HI>Musical Instruments</HI> in the Worship of God <HI>under the Law</HI>; but</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There was then a clear word of Institution for them.</HI> The Trum|pets of Silver and Cornets of Horn, were instituted by the hand of <HI>Moses, Numb.</HI> 10. in the ten first Verses, and <HI>Levit.</HI> 23.23, 24. and in <HI>Davids</HI> time there were added Cymbals of Brass, and Harps and Psalteries of fine Wood, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.4, 5. and that by Authority and direction from God, for so was the Commandment of the Lord by his Prophets, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.25. and therefore they are called the <HI>In|struments of Musick of the Lord,</HI> 2 Chron. 7.6. and we reade also of Timbrels, Organs, and Ten-stringed Instruments, <HI>Psal.</HI> 149.3. <HI>&amp;</HI> 150.4.</P>
<P>But there is not one word of Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itution for them under the Go|spel, but on the contrary they are cashiered and excluded out of Go|spel-worship, by that general Rule which the Apostle layes down concerning all the parts of Gods Worship, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.26. <HI>Let all

If I know not the meaning of the voice, <HI>he that speaketh shall be a Barbarian unto me,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.11. It is therefore a strange Comparison which some have used, who have said they know no Argument to prove the Or|gans simply unlawful, but what would prove a Cup of Wine unlaw|full. For we must remember, that the Question is concerning the use of them in the Worship of God: and therefore the Answer is, That there is a vast disparity of Reason between a Cup of Wine and Organs, for the one is instituted, the other not. Christ hath ap|pointed and commanded us to use Bread and Wine in his Worship in the Sacrament of the Supper, but he hath not appointed Cathedral Musick.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I do not finde in the Scripture, that these Musical Instruments were a part of their Synagogue-worship&punc; which was Moral, but rather of their Temple-worship, which was Ceremonial.</HI> In their Synagogues they had the publick Moral Worship of God, Reading and Expound|ing the Law, <HI>&amp;c. Acts</HI> 13.15. Some think they had Trumpets also in their Synagogues to call the people together, but this was a Moral use of them, for which we use the ringing of a Bell. But the Scri|pture is clear, that the Musical Instruments were appointed to be used continually before the Ark, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.4, 5, 6. <HI>And the Singers and Trumpeters stood at the East end of the Altar at the dedication of the Temple,</HI> 2 Chron. 5.12. And in <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> time, <HI>when the burnt-offering began, the song of the Lord began also, with the trumpets, and with the Instruments ordained by David King of Israel,</HI> 2 Chron. 29.27 28. But seeing Christ is come, and hath caused the Sacrifice and the Oblation to cease, and the City and the Sanctuary being both destroyed, as <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.26, 27. all the Worship that was affixed thereto is ceased with it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There was a typical signification in them.</HI> The Silver Trumpet signified the sounding of the Silver Trumpet of the Gospel through all the world, the Preaching of the pure Word of God by his Mes|sengers, who are said to <HI>lift up their voice as a trumpet,</HI> Isa. 58.1. <HI>Set the trumpet to thy mouth,</HI> Hos. 8.1. <HI>The tongue of the just is as choice silver,</HI> Prov. 10.20. and both these, and all the rest of their Musical Instruments, were expressions and signs of joy, <HI>Psal.</HI> 98.6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 89 15. <HI>Blessed is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he people that know the joyful sound.</HI> They were therefore

fit resemblances to shadow out that heavenly Musick, and inward Me|lody of the joyes and graces of Gods Spirit in the hearts of his people. The Apostle therefore exhorts us to sing, but in stead of Mu|sical Instruments, he requires <HI>the melody of the heart,</HI> Eph. 5.19. <HI>and grace in the heart,</HI> Coloss. 3.16.</P>
<P>But 4. <HI>Suppose the signification of the Jewish Musick could not be found out, (as indeed it is an hard thing to finde out the meaning of all their Ceremonies) we are delivered not onely from their Types and Cere|monies, but also from all their Yokes and Burthens.</HI> These things were a part of the burthensome <HI>Paedagogie,</HI> which the Church was under in the time of its Non-age and Childhood, but now the time of Go|spel-freedome is come, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.1. And therefore <HI>Aquinas,</HI> though a Popish Schoolman, yet he rejects and pleads against these Instruments of Musick, as being then used amongst the Jews <HI>quia populus erat ma|gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> durus &amp; carnalis,</HI> for which reason also they were so much en|couraged with promises of temporal things. And this Superstition was not brought into the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> it self in his time, who lived about 400 years ago, and he saith the reason was <HI>ne videatur Judaiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt,</HI> lest they should seem to <HI>Judaize.</HI> And he doth also well observe, that Musical Instruments do more stir up the minde to de|light, then frame it to a right disposition, they raise natural, rather then true Spiritual joy: which they that commend them as an help partly natural and partly artificial, to the exhilarating of the spirits for the praise of God, may do well to consider. They are such an help as God hath not appointed, and what God doth not appoint, he is not wont to bless. But why should we not have Trumpets in the Worship of God as well as Organs? for the Jews had Trumpets also. And why must we have them onely in Cathedral Churches? If <HI>Organs</HI> be too dear for every poor Parish, yet they might get <HI>Citherus</HI> or <HI>Bagpipes.</HI> And why should there not be Dancing in the Worship of God as well as Piping? For those old Idolaters in <HI>Exod.</HI> 32. did not onely shout, but also <HI>danced and played before their Idol.

<HEAD>IX. The Book of Common-Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>WHich is not, neither are you to look upon it under the Notion of a <HI>Directory,</HI> to inform and instruct men con|cerning the Worship of God, for doubtless it is as lawful to write Books of Prayer and publick Worship, as of Faith, or Love, or any other duty. But you must consider it as a <HI>Praescript Form,</HI> as a set and <HI>stinted Liturgie</HI> devised and appointed by men, to be read as a part of the publick Worship of God, and to be kept to, both for matter and words. This is the true state of the Case, and upon this account we look upon <HI>the Book of Common-Prayer as a Grand Idol</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for it is a breach of the second Command|ment more wayes then one.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Arguments of our Divines against the Books commonly called</HI> Apocrypha, <HI>may serve against the Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> for it is an Apocryphal Book, introduced into the publick Worship of God as a standing part thereof, and imposed by force and violence. But thus to introduce another Book, besides the Book of God, into his Church, is a dishonour, and an affront to the Scripture. <HI>If it</HI> be a sin for men <HI>to set their posts by his posts, their thresholds by his thresholds,</HI> as <HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.8. and <HI>their Altars by his Altars,</HI> 2 Kings 16.15. is it no sin to set their Books by his Book?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We do not finde any Precept for it in the Scripture, nor any Pro|mise that God will accept it, nor any hint of Example that ever any or|dinary Officers took upon them to impose stinted Liturgies upon the Church.</HI> If ever there had been need of such an help, surely it had been most seasonable amongst the Jews, in those weak and childish times: but we finde no such thing throughout the Scripture. It is true, God by the hand of his extraordinary Messengers did appoint some Forms, but neither were they tyed up to them, neither will this warrant or|dinary Officers to do the like. God hath forbidden his people to <HI>make to themselves</HI> Images, or <HI>Forms,</HI> or wayes of Worship, but he hath not restrained himself to set up what Images or Forms himself seeth good.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is fetcht from</HI> Rome. King <HI>James</HI> said, it was nothing else but <HI>an ill-said Mass in English.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. in his Declaration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Popish Rebels in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> which is in the Book of Martyrs,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ith, <HI>It seemeth unto you a new Service, but is indeed no other but the old, the self-same words in English that were in Latine, saving a few things taken out, which were so fond that it had been a shame to have heard them in English. If the Service of the Church was good in Latine, it remaineth good in English, for nothing is altered, but to speak with know|ledge what was spoken with ignorance, and to let you understand what is said for you.</HI> It was all taken out of the Mass-book, if we under|stand the word Mass-book in a large sense, as it is commonly taken: but to speak more narrowly, it was Collected out of three Popish Books. The first part of publick Prayers, <HI>Ex Breviario.</HI> The second part, <HI>viz.</HI> the Order of administring Sacraments, Matrimony, Vi|siting the Sick, and Burials, <HI>&egrave; Rituali.</HI> 3. The Order of Consecra|tion in the Supper, the Epistles, and Gospels, and Collects, <HI>&egrave; Missali,</HI> as the Form of Consecration of Bishops and Priests, was taken <HI>&egrave; Pon|tificali,</HI> as you may see more at large in <HI>Didoclavius,</HI> and in Mr. <HI>She|pard.</HI> Who also shews, that as the Common-Prayer was taken out of the Mass, so the principal parts of the Mass were borrowed from the Idolatrous Pagans, and had their Original from <HI>Numa Pompi|lius,</HI> that Conjurer, who lived 700 years before Christ, to adorn and deck, as the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> thought, the Religion of Christ Je|sus, to the which, when thus corrupted with Paganish and Popish mix|tures, the <HI>Romans</HI> were with much ado at last Converted, who till then were obstinate in their old Heathenish Religion. Insomuch that when <HI>Theodosius</HI> sent to the Senate to renounce their Pagan Religion, and receive the Law of Christ, they returned Answer that they would not, but would observe the Ancient Law <HI>Pompilian</HI> to avoid the ruine of the Common-wealth, which they feared would come by the Change of Religion. And to those principal parts of the Mass ta|ken from the Pagans, <HI>viz. Vestments, Holy Water, the Confiteor, Or|gans, Incense, Offertory, &amp;c.</HI> other deckings were also added, as divers Letanies, and the <HI>Kurie-eleeson, Lord have mercy upon us,</HI> to be sung nine times, invented by <HI>Gregory</HI> a Monk at first, well studied in the Laws of <HI>Numa,</HI> and <HI>Tullus Hostilius. Damasus,</HI> as <HI>Platina</HI> and <HI>Sa|bellius</HI> shew, inriched it with <HI>Gloria Patri; Sergius,</HI> with an <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> to be sung three times. <HI>Alexander</HI> and other Bishops added the Canon of the <HI>Mass,</HI> others the Epistles and Gospels. The Gradual, and Collects were added by <HI>Gelasius, Anno</HI> 493. the <HI>Gloria in Ex|celsis,</HI> by <HI>Symmachus,</HI> 508. At last came <HI>the Host</HI> in, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">062. Thus Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> concerning the Original of the Mass and Common-Prayer. Yea, such a Popish piece is this Book of Common-Prayer,

that as some of the Bishops have reported, Pope <HI>Paul</HI> IV. did offer Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to confirm and ratifie it by his Authority, <HI>Vt sacra hic omnia, hoc ipso quo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unc sunt apud nos modo procurari fas esset.</HI> And in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. his time, Cardinal <HI>Quignonius,</HI> at the request of Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VII. made the <HI>Popish Missall</HI> liker the <HI>English</HI> for a great part, then it was to the <HI>Roman Brevia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</HI></P>
<P>But let all true Protestants judge, whether it be fit for us to fetch our Worship from that <HI>Mother of Harlots,</HI> the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> and to go to the Pope to indite our Prayers; as if the Pope could tell how to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y better then the people of God, who have his Spirit dwel|ling in them. Some indeed have said, it is no matter whence it comes; but when <HI>Whitgift</HI> said so concerning <HI>Deans, Canons, Pre|bendaries,</HI> &amp;c. that it is not material though they come from the Pope, Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> replies, It is as if he should say, <HI>It skills not though they come out of the bottomless Pit</HI>: for whatsoever cometh from the Pope, which is Antichrist, cometh first from the Devil. The second Commandment forbids taking up Wayes and Forms of Worship from Idolaters, and it must needs be a great encouragement and harden|ing to the Papists, that their Mass is the Foundation of our Wor|ship.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It undermines that great Ordinance of the Ministry, the principal duties of which Office are Preaching and Prayer,</HI> Acts 6.4. in the one whereof they are the mouth of God to the people, in the other they are the mouth of the people unto God. But if we prescribe to one another set Forms of Prayer, why not by the same reason set Forms of <HI>Homilies?</HI> and then, as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> observes, neither the Apo|stles nor their Successors needed to have left off the Deacons imploy|ment, to attend upon the Ministry of the Word and Prayer, for both are prepared to their hands by the Prescriptions of others. Hence also Ministers shall little need to edifie the Church by their own gifts received of Christ to that end, but may edifie them by the gifts of others. Yea Ministers, though destitute of Ministerial gifts, yet may be fit for the publick discharge of their duties by the help of other mens gifts, both in Prayer and Preaching. And so indeed a <HI>Prescript Liturgie</HI> is properly a maintenance for an Idol dumb Ministry. What difference is there between the carrying of the Ark upon a Cart, and our Prayers upon a Book? whereas both should be carried, the one upon the shoulders of the Levites, the other upon the gifts of the Ministers.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It is a grievous sin against the Spirit of Prayer.</HI> It was set up


<PB N="71" REF="000151_0076_0FA2B82177BABD28">
at first in opposition to the Latine Worship of the <HI>Mass,</HI> and so in|deed it was a good step of Reformation, to get the Worship of God into a known Tongue: but now it is set up, and pleaded for in oppo|sition to the Spirit of Prayer, and therefore it deserves now to be cal|led by no better name but <HI>Nehushtan,</HI> an ill said Mass. Some con|ceive the <HI>first Reformers</HI> are not to be look'd upon altogether as ordi|nary <HI>Ministers,</HI> as being stirred up and acted by a more then ordi|nary Spirit in the Work of Reformation, and doing some things somewhat out of ordinary course, whereof this hath been not un|fitly reckoned to be one, the making <HI>Formula's</HI> of Divine Service, which might better be done in those dark and dismall times, when there was scarce one to be found for every County, that was able to Pray and Preach without a Book&punc; for so it was in the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time.</P>
<P>But now God hath poured out his Spirit upon all flesh, so that private Christians are able to pray to the publick edification of a whole Church: and therefore suppose it were lawful to use such a Crutch for those that could not pray without it, yet it is unreasonable and absurd to force a man to go with Crutches when he is not lame. It is a vain and needless thing, to tye Bladders under the wings of Sea-fowls to keep them from sinking, or to help them to swim. <HI>Ter|tullian</HI> saith, the Christians in the Primitive times were wont to pray <HI>sine monitore, quia de pectore,</HI> without a prompter, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they prayed from the heart; which Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> observes is spoken in opposition to the <HI>prompted Forms</HI> then in use <HI>amongst the Pagans.</HI> It is but an heartless way of praying, to say a Prayer out of a Book. The Apo|stle saith, We know not what to pray for as we ought, but <HI>the Spirit helpeth our infirmities,</HI> Rom. 8.26. It is the Spirits office to <HI>intercede in us,</HI> as Christ <HI>intercedes for us.</HI> But what great need is there of the Spirit, to reade a Prayer out of a Book? Other use therefore of the Common-prayer at this day I know not, then the quenching of the Spirit, and putting him as it were out of office, or at least limiting and stinting the Spirit, what and how many words he must manifest himself by, without alteration, addition, or diminution, and the fur|nishing of <HI>dumb Ministers</HI> with the Instrument of a foolish Shepherd, without which they would be dumb indeed, and unable to say any thing. To which may be also added, the arming of Persecutors with a bloody Weapon and Instrument of Violence, whereby to oppress the Consciences of Gods faithful Ministers and people, which some <HI>Episcopall men,</HI> who have been more ingenuous then the rest of their

Dr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Chester,</HI> upon a Debate with Mr. <HI>Ley</HI> a|bout the Service-book, he confessed at last, and said, <HI>We shall never have Peace and true Charity in the Church, untill it be taken away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It would fill a Volume to enumerate and reckon up all the Cor|ruptions of the matter of it.</HI> The false Doctrine, <HI>That it is certain by Gods Word, that Children that be Baptized are undoubtedly saved.</HI> The intolerable dishonour done to the Scripture, setting up <HI>Hagar</HI> equal with her Mistris, by appointing <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> to the number of 104 Chapters, yea the very Tales in <HI>Tobit,</HI> to be read in the publick Wor|ship of God, but a great part of <HI>Canonical Scripture</HI> quite omitted, and left out of the <HI>Kalender.</HI> The <HI>Superstitious Observations</HI> of Holy-dayes, the Sign of the Cross, Churching of Women, Those <HI>absurd</HI> broken responds, and shreds of Prayer, whereby they toss their Prayers, like Tennis-balls, between the Priest and People, <HI>Tautologies, O Lord deliver us,</HI> eight times; <HI>We beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</HI> twenty times. <HI>Complementing</HI> with God in their Prayers, <HI>We beseech thee give us those things which for our unworthiness we dare not presume to ask</HI>; a most weak and legal passage, as if a Believer that prayes in Christs Name, might not freely ask of God any thing he needs, yea the greatest things, the Spirit, and the Glory to come. Yea, there is <HI>Nonsense</HI> in it, as when they call the Lessons out of <HI>Isaiah, Joel,</HI> and the Prophets, <HI>Epistles.</HI> And when that <HI>Collect,</HI> where they say, <HI>Thou hast sent thy Son to be born as on this day,</HI> is appointed to be said six dayes together one after another, as if Christ were born six times over.

Let it be a word of Exhortation to the Bishops, and to the Episcopal Party, not to revive the Superstitions and Idolatries of for|mer times, or at least not to impose them.</HI> For you see what the Text saith, the Lord will have them to be rooted out: and therefore he will be angry with you, if you practise them, but his wrath will burn like fire, if you impose them. I might here speak many things, to shew the unreasonableness of such Impositions; for I do not now speak meerly against the things themselves, but against that violent, that bloody, that imposing Spirit, the Spirit of Persecution. I think it were easie to offer such Considerations to you concerning it, as might not onely convince your Consciences, but also move and melt your bowels. Make it your own case. If your Consciences were against such things, you would be loth to be imposed upon. You may fight for them with the Sword of the Spirit, and maintain them by the Word of God, if you can, but take heed of flying to Carnal Weapons, to oppress those Truths of Christ, which by dint of Spiritual Reason you cannot sub|due. If any of these men be present before the Lord this day, sup|pose you had been compelled in former times to turn Independents, or to let your Children die unbaptized, or to do it without the Sign of the Cross, I suppose you would have filled Heaven and Earth with your cries. And give me leave to tell you, that if you will be perse|cuting, the people of God will cry, and never cease crying in the ears of the Lord against you, till he hath brought upon you the Judgement written. Consider therefore how you would be dealt with, if it were your own case, and remember how you have been dealt with. I have been in <HI>Ireland</HI> these five years, and I do not know any Episcopal man, if of a good life and Conversation, that hath been deprived of the Liber|ty of his Ministry, but they have been tolerated and suffered as well as others to Preach the Gospel, which is all that I desire this day: and will the men of that Perswasion be so disingenuous, as to requite evil for good? will you he worse then the Scribes and Pharisees? who though they had not the grace to forgive their enemies, yet they had so much good nature as to love their friends: will you give us cause to say, that there is not so much as common Ingenuity to be found amongst you?</P>
<P>If you will be content with your own Liberty, and suffer your Neighbours that differ from you, to live peaceably and quietly with you, you may <HI>go to Gilgal, and pass over to Beth-aven,</HI> make haste to|wards <HI>Rome,</HI> be as Idolatrous and Superstitious as you please, I know no Minister, nor private Christian, that will hinder you, or give any the least impediment or obstruction to you, further then this, that we

will fight against you with <HI>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God</HI>; but for any external impediment, we leave that to the Magistrate to whom it belongs, to <HI>remove the high places, and break the Images, and cut down the Groves.</HI> But if you will not be content to sin alone, but will needs persecute and compel us to sin and perish with you, you will engage the Prayers of all the people of God against you as one man. When you have stopt our mouthes from Preaching, yet we shall Pray, and not onely we, but all the Souls that have been converted, or com|forted and edified by our Ministry, of whom you know there be, through the grace of Christ, many in this City and Nation, they will all cry to the Lord against you for want of Bread, because you deprive them of those that should <HI>break the bread of life to them.</HI> And how dreadful this will be unto you, I think I need not tell you. For when Saints pray, God will hear, especially if they unite their forces, and joyn together in the same requests. I had rather be environed with Armies of armed men, &amp; compassed round about with drawn Swords, and Instruments of death, then that the least praying Saint should bend the edge of his Prayers against me, for there is no standing before the Prayers of the Saints. You may see throughout the whole Scripture, and especially in the Book of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> what a powerful influence they have into all the Revolutions of Providence: before the opening of the Seven Seals, we reade of <HI>golden Vials full of odours, which are the Prayers of the Saints,</HI> Rev. 5.8. and before the sounding of the Se|ven Trumpets, that great and dreadful dispensation of Providence, consisting of four lesser <HI>Woes,</HI> which made way for the three great <HI>Woes</HI>; for the <HI>Pope,</HI> who appears openly under the <HI>fifth Trumpet,</HI> and for the <HI>Turk,</HI> who breaks loose in the <HI>sixth,</HI> and for the final destru|ction of all Enemies, by the <HI>seventh Trumpet.</HI> The introduction to all these astonishing Judgements was this, Christ appears as the Angel of the Covenant, with a golden Censer in his hand, and with much In|cense of his own merits and mediation, and <HI>offers it up with the prayers of all Saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the Throne; and the smoke of the Incense, with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angels hand,</HI> and after this there followed <HI>Thunderings and Lightnings,</HI> and dreadful dispensations, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.3, 4. Lastly, before the pouring out of the <HI>seven Vials,</HI> which is thought by many to be the dispensation that these Times are under, the Saints are brought in praying and praising God, <HI>Rev.</HI> 15. and the <HI>seven Angels,</HI> the Instru|ments of Christ in the execution of these Plagues, are said to <HI>come out of the Temple,</HI> that is, out of <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> ver. 6. and one of <HI>the

four living Creatures,</HI> which some of the best Interpreters understand to be Church-Officers, and Ministers of the Gospel, <HI>gave unto the seven Angels, seven golden Vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever,</HI> ver. 7. It is their Faith and Prayers, and the light of Christ in their Ministry, that sets all the wheels a-going for the ruine of Enemies, for God puts all the Prayers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears of his Saints into his bottle, <HI>Psal.</HI> 56.8. and pours them down again in Plagues, and in streams of fire, and blood, and brimstone, upon a malignant wicked world. If it be so dan|gerous to offend the least Saint, that Christ himself professeth, <HI>it were better for that man that a milstone were tyed about his neck, and to be thrown with it into the bottom of the sea, then to offend one of these little ones,</HI> how dreadful will it then be to offend and grieve the Spirit of God in the hearts of all his people, and so to rowze that Lion, the Spirit of Prayer against you. For I testifie unto you, that as the Saints will pray, so the Lord himself will fight against you, and take you into his own revenging hand. I speak it conditionally, in case you persecute, and <HI>I wish all the Bishops in</HI> Ireland <HI>heard me</HI>; for in the Name, and in the love of Christ I speak it to you, and I beseech you so to take it. I say, if once you fall to the old trade of Persecution, the Lord Jesus will never bear it at your hands, but he will bring upon you swift destruction. And your <HI>second Fall</HI> will be worse then the first: for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 5.3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>Dagon the first time did onely fall before the Ark of God. But when the men of Ashdod had set him up in his place again the second time, then he brake himself all to pieces by his second fall, insomuch that there was nothing but the stump of Dagon left.</HI> Perse|cution is a very ripening sin, and therefore if once you super-adde the sin of <HI>Persecution</HI> to the sin of <HI>Superstition,</HI> you will be quickly ripe for final ruine, and for the vengeance of eternal fire. And in the day when God shall visit you, the guilt of all the righteous blood that hath been shed upon the face of the earth, from the blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> to the blood of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Vdall</HI> was a godly <HI>Non-Conformable</HI> Minister, who was cast into Prison by the Bishops, and at last died there, by means of their cruelty towards him.</NOTE> <HI>Vdall,</HI> and unto this day, it will come down the hill upon your heads, even upon the Persecutors of this generation. The Lord Jesus, when the day of Vengeance is in his heart, and when the year of his Redeemed is come, which is not far off, he will then require all that blood, and revenge it all upon your heads, if you justifie the wayes of former Persecutors, by walking in the same steps of Blood and Violence.</P>
