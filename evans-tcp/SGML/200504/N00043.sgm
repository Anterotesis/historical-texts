<P>_IN the beginning of this Chapter, we read of a General Assembly of the Representative body of the people of Israel: thus in <HI>verse</HI> 1. <HI>Then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel, and all the head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Tribes, the chiefe of the Fathers of the children of Israel: and</HI> verse 2, 3. <HI>And all the men of Israel assem|bled themselves, and all the Elders of Israel came.</HI></P>

A renewed Prayer for a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssing to be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther granted, bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h at the present and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> times.</P>
<P N="1">1 And first he prayes for the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acious presence of God, even such a gracious presence of God with them as their Fathers had enjoyed. <HI>verse</HI> 57; <HI>the Lord our God be with us as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en with our Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; and because his heart was much in this, therefore he repeats it againe, <HI>let him not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eave us nor forsaken.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He prayes for Divine assistance <HI>verse</HI> 58. <HI>That he may encline our hearts unto him to walk in his wayes, and to keep his Commandements, which he Commanded our Fathers.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. His third request is for Divine protection <HI>verse</HI> 59. <HI>Let these my Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yers be nigh to the Lord our God, that He maintaine the cause of his People Israel, which is amplyfied by the end of it; that all the People of the Earth may know that the Lord i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God and that there is none else. vers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 60.</P>
<P N="3">3. And then the last particular wherein be blesseth the People is, by Exhorting them to upright walk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng with God. <HI>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk in his Statutes and to keep his Commandements as at this day, verse</HI> 61.</P>
<P>The Text (as you see) falls within the compass of Solomons bles|sing upon the representative body of the People of Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ael.</P>
<P>From the whole you may please to take notice of this Observation in the generall, which I shall but briefly touch upon.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> The Lords gracious presence with his people inclining their hearts to keep his Commandements, and maintaining th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir cause; is a Sufficient means to Establish the welfare of such a people, even as their own hearts can wish.</P>
<P>For thus did Solomon bless the heads of the Tribes of Israel, and he had the hearts of the whole Congregation going along with him, that if the Lord would but grant his presence with them, his as|sistance of them, and his protection over them, they had enough, they
<PB N="3" REF="000080_0006_0F9F8FA5D66F8BA8">
could have no more, they could be no better in this world.</P>
<P>And if we our selves now might have our wish, if the Lord should say to us as <HI>Ah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uerus</HI> to <HI>Esther, what is thy P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion?</HI> or as he said sometime to Solomon, <HI>ask wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t I shall give thee</HI>; what could any of us, or all of us desire more then this? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Lord our God would be with us, as he hath been with our Fathers, that he would incline our hearts to keep h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Commandements which he Commanded our Fathers, and that he would maintaine his own and his Peoples cause amongst us:</HI> what can be desired and enjoyed by us more then this?</P>
<P>For, doth not <HI>Immanu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, God with us,</HI> comprehend our whole good? and the <HI>keepin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Gods Commandements</HI> containe our whole duty? and is not the Lords maintaining the cause of his People enough to keep off whatever might interrupt or hinder us in the performing this duty, and enjoying that good wherein the utmost happyness of a People on this side Heaven doth consist? Let these requests (there|fore) dwell upon the hearts of all the Lords People, let us bear them continually upon our hearts before the Lord, that as hitherto, so still, he may graunt unto all his Servants, both Magistrates, Ministers, and People, his Gracious presence, divine assistance, and divine protection in the times that are come upon us. This is the Summe of all that we need or can receive, or can desire, whilest we are here tossed in the troublesome sea of this World, passing to the Haven of eternall rest.</P>
<P>But I shall not further insist upon this. It is another Doctrine which I mainly intend from the latter part of the 59 <HI>verse. That he maintaine the cause of his People at all times as the matter shall require.</HI> There are two things need a little opening here.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is meant by the cause of his People Israel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What is meant by the Lords maintaining the cause of his Peo|ple at all times as the matter shall require.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. By [<HI>the cause of his People Israel</HI>] I understand the same which in other Scriptures is called the <HI>cause of God, Psal.</HI> 74.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2. <HI>Arise O God and plead thy own Cause.</HI> So that there is a cause of God in the World, (mark I beseech you) there is a cause which is Gods own cause: <HI>Arise O Lord and plead thy own cause.</HI> And if you please but to cast your ey upon two or three passages of that <HI>Psalm,</HI> we need go no further to understand clearly, what is the cause of God: <HI>verse</HI> 20. <HI>have respect unto the Covenant,</HI> the cause of God is the cause of his Co|venant,
<PB N="4" REF="000080_0007_0F9F8FA5E8E3CDD0">
it is also the cause of his <HI>Temple the dwelling place of his name, verse</HI> 7. and further, it is the cause of his Church, <HI>verse</HI> 2. <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">member thy Congregation which thou hast purchased of old, thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed, this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwel,</HI> i. e. his Church, and so in the 8 <HI>verse</HI> you read of the <HI>Synagogues</HI> of God in the Land.</P>
<P>Now the very same was the cause of his People Israel, for the spe|ciall end of the great assembly mentioned in this Chapter, it was to bring in the <HI>Ark of the Covenant</HI> into the house of the Lord: by vir|tue of which Covenant the Lord was their God and they were his people; and, the cause of God was theirs, and their cause was his; the cause of God &amp; his People Israel was one and the same, and that was the cause of Religion according to the word of God. Therefore in the Text here Solomon prayes that the hearts of his People might be <HI>enclined to walk in Gods&punc; wayes and to keep his Commandements.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, it is observable, the word rendred <HI>cause</HI> here in the text is translated [<HI>right</HI>] in the Margine of the 45. <HI>&amp;</HI> 49. <HI>verses,</HI> that he <HI>maintain the right of his People,</HI> there is a right unto house and land and the like, but there is a <HI>jus divinum,</HI> a speciall divine right which the People of Israel had unto the one true Religion, and a liberty annexed unto that right that none could lawfully hinder them from enjoying all that belonged to the service of God.</P>
<P>So that (in one word) the <HI>cause of his people Israel</HI> was right from God, and liberty from God, to keep Gods Commandements in mat|ters of Religion. This was the cause of God and Israel then, and I hope it will appear anon, that the very same is the cause of God and his people now.</P>
<P N="2">2. What is meant by [the Lords maintaining this cause at all times as the matter shall require] He had made the same request twice before <HI>verse</HI> 45. <HI>&amp;</HI> 49. that he <HI>maintain his Peoples cause</HI>; here he mentions it againe the third time, that he <HI>maintain the cause of his People Israel,</HI> with an addition of this further expression, <HI>at all times as the matter shall require.</HI></P>
<P>He had before in his large Prayer comprehended all the common cases which might fall out; but because there might be other cases which he could not foresee, or they might be otherwise circumstan|ced, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the cause of Israel might be so endangered, as there
<PB N="5" REF="000080_0008_0F9F8FA6518686C8">
would not be any help in the ey of reason in the sight of Man, there|fore he commends the cause of his People Israel to the Lord himselfe, and leaves it with him, and beseecheth him, that he by his preroga|tive would maintain <HI>the cause of his people, even as the matter should re|quire.</HI></P>
<P>And those words in the Text [<HI>at all times</HI>] are in the Margine rend|red [<HI>the thing of a day</HI> in his day] <HI>i. e&punc;</HI> not onely in the day of pros|perity when things go <HI>smoothly on</HI>; but in the dayes of adversity, in the <HI>Hirracano's</HI> of tempestuous times, when it is a day <HI>of trouble and re|buke, and Blasphemy,</HI> as is was in Hezekiahs time, <HI>Isai.</HI> 37.3. in a day of perplexity and treading down, <HI>Isai</HI> 22.5. in such a day as this, the cause of God and Israel is Committed to the Lord himself that he would <HI>maintain it.</HI></P>
<P>And there is an Emphasis to be observed in that word [<HI>He</HI>] that He <HI>maintain it,</HI> when there is none else that will, or can, or knowes how: implying the need (the extream need) that the people of Israel might sometimes have for the Lord himselfe <HI>to maintain their cause</HI> above all that themselves, or any else should be able to doe.</P>
<P>So that the point of Doctrine which I would commend unto the consideration of this present Assembly from hence, is this.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> The times may be such, and the case may be such, as the main|taining of the cause of Religion, may need and require more then ordi|nary help from the Lord himself.</P>
<P>The times may be so perillous, and the case so circumstanced, and the cause of Religion so endangered, as it may be above the wisedom of Man to direct, or the hand of Man to help: then there is work for Jehovah himselfe, for him to <HI>maintain his own and his Peoples cause,</HI> you see the point: a little for the Proof.</P>
<P>It is many times the cry of the Church of God in the World, <HI>give us help from trouble O Lord, for vaine is the help of Man, Psal.</HI> 108. <HI>last. and our help is in the Name of the Lord, who made the Heavens and the Earth, Psal.</HI> 124. <HI>last.</HI> there is creating wisedom &amp; power and good|ness with him, that is <HI>God over all, Blessed for evermore,</HI> there and from thence alone is the help of his People when its no where else to be seen upon Earth.

<HEAD>There is a three f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld Reason may convince us of the Truth of the Doctrine.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. From the weakness of Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. From the Malice of the Devil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. From the Providence of God.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. The first reason is taken from <HI>the weakness of Men,</HI> from the inability of Gods own People, who are affected unto this cause, and engaged in it, but are not able to maintain it.</P>
<P>The best of the Saints have flesh as well as Spirit, they have some|thing of the <HI>Old Man, as well as of the New</HI>; they <HI>know but in part,</HI> and are <HI>Sanctified but in part</HI>: and hence many weaknesses in managing the cause of God.</P>
<P>There is a mixture of Hypocrites amongst the sincere Servants of God, who pretend unto this cause as well as they; and hence many times not onely weakness but wickedness is inter-woven into the fairest pretences to the cause of God.</P>
<P>There are various apprehensions, affections, and passions, amongst good men. <HI>Moses the Servant,</HI> and <HI>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</HI> are sometimes unadvised: and when they are most upright, when they lead the People according to the <HI>skilfulness of their hands, and Integrity of their Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> yet then traduced, reproached, opposed, <HI>et tantum n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> overpoured by a murmuring People, and there were <HI>Men of renown and famous in the Congregation,</HI> that would not submit unto Gods order.</P>
<P>Sometimes (<HI>alas</HI>) there is a sharp contention between <HI>Paul</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="000080_0010_0F9F8FA7F25DC0C8">
<HI>Barnabas</HI>: and Godly <HI>Peter doth not ever walk with a right foot</HI>: and blessed <HI>Paul</HI> when most faithfull and true, is under evill surmises, as a <HI>deceiver.</HI> There is names and parties of men, dividing Christ a|mongst them: some <HI>departing from the Faith,</HI> others led aside from the simplicity of the Gospel, <HI>on the right hand, and on the left,</HI> and many (in the last dayes very many) that <HI>have the form but deny the power of Godlyness.</HI></P>
<P>Hence the cause of Religion much obscured and ready to be spoyl|ed in the hands of those that profess to be the lovers of it. That is the first Reason.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Taken from the <HI>Malice of the Devil, and his Instruments:</HI> Satan from the beginning hath had an old grudg against the seed of the Woman, and he never wanted instruments, who either by force or fraud or both, have done what mischief they could against the Church and cause of God.</P>
<P>Thus in the story of <HI>Exod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> Pharoah at first works wisely to un|dermine, afterwards he works proudly to overtake and destroy the Is|rael of God. Thus also in <HI>Psal.</HI> 83.1, 2, 3. <HI>Keep not Silence O God, for lo thine Enemies make a tumult, they have consulted together, they have said, come let us cut them off that the name of Israel be had no more in re|membrance</HI>; and then there is mention made of <HI>Gebal, Ammon,</HI> and <HI>Amalek</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>And in the time of <HI>Ezra,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> no sooner had <HI>Zerubbabel</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI> and the rest of the poor People of Israel begun to reform and set themselves abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the work of the Lord, but Sathan stood up to resist them, as it is in <HI>Zech.</HI> 3.1. <HI>&amp; he had instruments at hand presently Sanballat and Tobia, with their complices, Nehem.</HI> 4.11. <HI>and our adver|saries said they shall neither see, nor know, till we be in the midst amongst them, and Slay them and cause their work to cease,</HI> thus also in <HI>Ezr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 4.9. you read of <HI>Rehum the Chancellor,</HI> and <HI>Shimshi the Scribe,</HI> with the rest of their companions, pleading much the damage and dishonour of the King as in <HI>verse</HI> 13. and when they had got a commission they went up in hast unto Jerusalem to <HI>cause the work to cease,</HI> and in the <HI>verse</HI> 23&punc; <HI>they made them cease by force and power,</HI> though it was but for a time as it appeares afterwards.</P>
<P>And if you look into <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.12. you shall find there in relation to the last times, it is said, <HI>Woe to the inhabitants of the Earth, and of
<PB N="8" REF="000080_0011_0F9F8FA8C3060858">
the Sea, for the Devil is come down amongst you, and his rage is great, be|cause he hath but a short time,</HI> the shorter the time the fiercer the rage of Sathan against all that <HI>keep the Commandements of God, and the Faith of Jesus</HI>; &amp; where ever he can prevail, down goes the divine Authority of the Scriptures, and up goes the Commandements of Men in the Worship of God: and all that will not doe, must suffer, and all that bear witness to truth and Holiness, must <HI>be in sackclo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h until the time of the End.</HI></P>
<P>Now from hence (againe) the cause of Religion is much endang|ered by the haters of it. That is the Second Reason.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. The last Reason is taken from <HI>afflicting Providence,</HI> He (the great God) <HI>changeth the times and the seasons, Dan.</HI> 2.21. the History of the Church in all ages hath informed us of this, that after a time <HI>of peace,</HI> comes a time <HI>of trouble,</HI> after a time <HI>of liberty</HI> (to be as good as men would be and as they should be) there comes a time of <HI>restraint</HI>: and sometimes even in the valley of vision <HI>there is a day of perplexitie and treading down,</HI> and <HI>that from the Lord God of Hostes,</HI> as it is in <HI>Isai.</HI> 22.5.</P>
<P>And though it hath been questioned whether <HI>Dioclesians persecuti|on</HI> or <HI>Julians Toleration</HI> were more pernicious to the Church of God, yet without question neither of these was without the Providence of God.</P>
<P>When the People of God know not how to use their peace and li|berty, when they have contracted the guilt of the Sins of such times, it is but righteous with the Lord to bring them into bondage, that they may know the service of the Lord with such a kind of Knowledg as <HI>Adam</HI> had after his fall, to know good by the want, and evil by the feeling of it, <HI>by terrible things in righteousness will thou answer us O God, who yet art the God of our Salvation and the confidence of such as are in the ends of the Earth, Psal.</HI> 65.5.</P>
<P>But from hence also the cause of Religion comes to be in the same condition as the ship in which the disciples went when <HI>Christ</HI> was a|sleep, there came down such a <HI>storm upon the Lake,</HI> and they were so covered with the waves, and in such Jeopardy, they were faine to cry out unto him, <HI>Master save us or we peris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>
<P>Gather up the Reasons briefly.</P>
<P>If the lovers of the cause of Religion be so unable to preserve it, if
<PB N="9" REF="000080_0012_0F9F8FA9893EC688">
the haters of it be so sedulous to destroy it, and if the Lord himselfe seem to withdraw from it; then it is no wonder if the times be such; and the case be such, as the maintaining of the cause of Religion doth need and require more then ordinary help from the Lord himselfe.</P>
<P>By this time you see the truth of the Doctrine. Now let us con|sider the good of it in <HI>Application to our selves,</HI> and that but in a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uple of Uses.</P>
<P>The one for the <HI>Information of our Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>The other for <HI>direction in point of Practice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> 1. We may hence informe our selves, not only <HI>what the Cause of God and his people is in other parts</HI>; but <HI>what it is here with us.</HI> I say, to informe us what is the cause of God and his people in <HI>New-England.</HI> This is the first use.</P>
<P>A mistake in this may be of dangerous consequence; the true stating of this cause, and the right understanding of it, may be of no little help unto us in the times that are come upon us.</P>
<P>For it is more then our lives, and as much as our soules are worth, to <HI>own the cause of God,</HI> and to be <HI>faithfull to it in our generation</HI>: to con|fess or deny this cause, is in Scripture interpretation to confess or deny <HI>Christ himselfe,</HI> and you know what he hath said in <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.32. <HI>Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess before my Father which is in Heaven, but whosoever shall deny me before Men, him will I de|ny before my Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her which is in Heaven</HI>: and in the eighth of <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>verse</HI> 38. <HI>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adul|terous and sinful Generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with all his Holy Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave then I beseech you, Honoured and Beloved, to pre|sent a few things unto you about this <HI>Caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> I confess I should be utterly inexcusable in adventuring to shew my weakness in such a place at such a time as this, were I not able to call the <HI>Most Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> to Witness that nothing but Conscience of my duty put me and kept me upon this Subject: when I received the Summons of the <HI>Honoura|bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Court</HI> to preach at this time, it was desired that some suitable word might be spoken: now whether the stating of the cause of God and his People amongst us be not seasonable, I leave to the consideration of this <HI>awful and solemn Asse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly.</HI> And I hope in the Lord I shall say nothing about it, but what might be more abundantly made out by
<PB N="10" REF="000080_0013_0F9F8FAA1B5EB6C0">
Scripture light, and what the generallity of all the People of God (not engaged unto parties) will readily subscribe unto.</P>
<P>First then, <HI>in the general</HI> the cause of God and his people, amongst as is the <HI>Cause of Religion,</HI> I say the cause of Religion <HI>i. e. the profession and practize of the one true Religion to be in all things according to Gods Word.</HI> This was the cause of God and Israel then, the same is the cause of God and his people now. <HI>To keep and seek for all the Cammande|ments of God. To walk in his waies and to keep his Commandements which he Commanded our Fathers, as it is in the text: that every thing in</HI> Doctrine Worship and Discipline be conformed unto and regulated by the rule of the word. This is the <HI>Cause of God</HI> and his People in New-England in the Generall.</P>
<P>But that it may be more clearly understood, let me propound it more particularly both in the <HI>Negative,</HI> what this cause is not, and in the <HI>Affirmative</HI> what it is.</P>
<P>And first Negatively.</P>
<P><HI>It is</HI>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not the getting of this Worlds good.</HI> The cause we are speaking of, it never was, it is not now, the getting &amp; increasing of this worlds good. Our Saviour Christ hath commanded, <HI>seek first the Kingdome of God and the righteousness therof, and all other things shall be added</HI> Mat. 6.33. Accordingly when the Lord stirred up the spirits of so many of his people to come over into this wilderness, it was not for world|ly wealth, or a better livelyhood here for the outward man: the generallity of the people that came over professed the contrary: nor had we any rationall grounds to expect such a thing in such a wilder|ness as this.</P>
<P>And though God hath blessed his poor people here with an ad|dition of many earthly comforts, and there are that have encreased here from small beginnings to great estates, that the Lord may call this whole generation to witness and say, <HI>O generation see the word of the Lord, have I been a wilderness unto you? Jer.</HI> 2.32. <HI>O generation see!</HI> look upon your townes &amp; fields, look upon your habitations &amp; shops and ships, and behold your numerous posterity, and great encrease in the blessings of the Land &amp; Sea, <HI>have I been a wilderness unto you?</HI> we
<PB N="11" REF="000080_0014_0F9F8FAAE4B60688">
must needs answer, <HI>No Lord, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u hast been a gracious God, and exceed|ing good unto thy Servants, ever since we came into this wilderness, even in these earthly blessings, we live in a more plentifull &amp; comfortable manner then ever we did expect,</HI> But these are but additions, they are but ad|ditionall mercies, it was another thing and a better thing that we followed the Lord into the wilderness for.</P>
<P>My Fathers and Brethren, this is never to be forgotten, that <HI>New-England is originally a plantation of Religion, not a plantation of Trade.</HI></P>
<P>Let Merchants and such as are increasing <HI>Cent per Cent</HI> remember this, Let others that have come over since at several times understand this, that worldly gain was not the end and designe of the people of <HI>New-England,</HI> but <HI>Religion.</HI> And if any man amongst us make Reli|gion as <HI>twelve,</HI> and the world as <HI>thirteen,</HI> let such an one know he hath neither the spirit of a <HI>true New-England man,</HI> nor yet of a <HI>sin|cere Christian.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Not <HI>Separation from other Churches,</HI> either in our own or other countries; I say, not separation from any thing good in other Church|es, whether truth of <HI>Church estate,</HI> or any <HI>Doctrine</HI> professed, or any <HI>Ordinance</HI> administred, <HI>so far as it was, or is agreeable to the word of God.</HI></P>
<P>We deny not the being of Churches, where many things are want|ing to their well-being. We distinguish between the <HI>corruptions and disorders of Churches,</HI> and the <HI>Churches themselves.</HI> We profess <HI>com|munion with,</HI> not <HI>separation from</HI> the Churches of Christ in lawfull things. They are the <HI>European</HI> Churches, in which that numerous company of 144000. are said to <HI>stand with the Lamb upon mount Sion, Rev.</HI> 14.1. and these are said to <HI>keep the Commandements of God and the faith of Jesus</HI> verse 12. It is the doctrine and worship of the Re|formed Churches comming out of Popery, which are said to be as a <HI>Sea of glass mingled with fire, Rev</HI> 15.2. if <HI>glass,</HI> then they are not <HI>clear as Cristall,</HI> as those in the Primitive times, <HI>Chap.</HI> 4 6 and yet not as <HI>the blood of a dead man,</HI> as those under Popery <HI>Chap.</HI> 16.3. it is a <HI>Sea of glass mingled with fire,</HI> (the fire of persecution without, and of contention within) and yet they that stand upon this <HI>Sea</HI> have gotten the <HI>victory over the Beast, and have the Harpes of God in their hands and are accepted of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The end of our comming hither was a reformation only of what was amiss or defective in the churches we came from&punc; from which we
<PB N="12" REF="000080_0015_0F9F8FAD603BA9C8">
made no separation, but a locall secession only into this wilderness, with true desires and endeavours after a more full Reformation ac|cording to Gods word.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not a toleration of all Religions,</HI> or of the <HI>Heresies &amp; Idolatries</HI> of the age we live in. I say, not a toleration of these so farr as wee have liberty and power for to help it. How inconsistent would such a toleration be, with the love of the one true Religion revealed in the word of God? would not such a state be guilty of having <HI>other Gods,</HI> where such a toleration is? is it not the end of Civill Authority, that men may <HI>live a quiet &amp; peaceable life, in godliness as well as honesty?</HI> but not in the wayes of ungodliness, no more then in the wayes of dishonesty: in a word, the Gospel of Jesus Christ hath a <HI>right para|mount,</HI> all rights in the world, it hath a <HI>Divine &amp; Supream</HI> right to be received in every Nation, and the <HI>knee of Magistracie</HI> is to bow at the name of <HI>Jesus.</HI> This right carryes <HI>liberty along with it,</HI> for all such as profess the Gospel, to walk according to the <HI>Faith &amp; Order of the Gospell.</HI> That which is contrary to the Gospel hath <HI>no right,</HI> and therefore should have <HI>no liberty.</HI> But the Lawes which have been made by the Civill Government here, with respect unto Reli|gion, whereby you have declared your <HI>professed subjection to the Gos|pel,</HI> and your <HI>non-toleration</HI> of that which is <HI>contrary thereunto</HI>; this will be a name and a glory to New-England <HI>so long as the Sun and Moon endure.</HI></P>
<P>And so much for the Negative, what the cause of God and his People amongst us is not, <HI>viz,</HI> not this Worlds good, not separation, not a toleration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now in the second place for the Affirmative, if my weakness was able to shew you what the Cause of God and his People in <HI>New-England</HI> is, according to its <HI>divine Originall</HI> and <HI>Native beautie,</HI> it would dazle the eyes of Angels, daunt the hearts of devils, ravish and chain fast the Affections of all the Saints.

<P N="1">1. The Cause of God and ours it was and is <HI>Reformation of Religi|on according to Gods word.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000080_0016_0F9F8FADEA4E0078">There was Religion in the Churches from whence we came, but New-Englands design in this vast undertaking, it was Reformation <HI>i. e. the avoyding of some special corruptions, and the Vigorous profession and practise of every thing, in Doctrine, worship and discipline, accord|ing to Scripture patterne</HI>: as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.5. when Moses was about to make the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> he was admonished of God, <HI>saying&punc; see that thou make it in all things according to the pattern shewed thee in the mount.</HI> And our Saviour said unto his disciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.20. <HI>teach them to observe all whatsoever I have Commanded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This was and is our Cause, that Christ alone might be acknowledged by us, as the onely head, Lord, and Law-giver, in his Church, that his written word might be acknowledged as the onely Rule, that onely and all his Institu|tions might be observed and enjoyed by us, and that with p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ritie and libertie, with peace and power.</HI> This was the end of our coming hither, this is our Cause, hence I humbly conceive that the consent of the Synod here to the confession of Faith by the Assembly of Westminster, and the platform of Discipline published in the year 49 these for the substance of them, have carryed with them a declaration of the Faith and order of these Churches, and are so looked upon by the reformed Churches abroad, unto which may be added many other books of our divines of the same import: and the practise of these Churches so farr as we have attained.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A progress in Reformation.</HI> I conceive our cause is, not barely, a Reformation, but a progress in reformation; it was the charge of our Saviour to the Church of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld fast what thou hast, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.11. it is also the duty of the People of God to go on unto perfection, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.1.</P>
<P>A conceit of having allready attained a perfect reformation should be farr from us: a true endeavour after a full reformation in the sense of our many defects, is the duty and Spirit of sincere Chri|stians that advance the Word of God, as the onely perfect rule, not that we have already attained or are already perfect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as the Apostle speaks of himselfe, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.12. but we are to press forward still un|to this mark, that we may in all be conformable to the perfect rule of the word of God.</P>
<P>Hence what we have attained in Doctrine, Worship &amp; Discipline, according to Gods Word, we must h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and then go forward

unto any of the things of Christ, we are defective in, <HI>we must go for|ward still, but not backward,</HI> I say not backward, <HI>as for Instance.</HI></P>
<P>Our Fathers fled into this Wilderness from the face <HI>of a Lording Episcopacie, and humane injunctions in the Worship of God: now if any of us their Children should yeild unto, or be instrumentall to set up in this Country, any of the wayes of mens inventions, such as Prelacie, imposed Leiturgies, humane Ceremonies in the Worship of God, or to admitt igno|rant and Scandalous Persons to the Lords Table, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s would be a backslid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing indeed</HI>: it would be a backsliding to the things which we and our Fathers have departed from, and have openly testified against, to be not of God, as in the Platform of Discipline, and many other wayes&punc; Instance againe, if after such a publick witness as hath been given amongst us against a toleration of all Religions, there should be a <HI>graduall yeilding to a toleration</HI> of any false Religion, (either by Law, or against Law, for want of the Execution of Laws,) this also would be a heinous backsliding which the Lords jealousy will not bear. <HI>And for our Civil Government to put forth any act of consent unto either of the former, would be a thing to be trembled at, and Prayed against, that the Lord would keep them from.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other side: it is our duty to press forward still to the mark; and to make a progress in reforming what ever is amiss or defective a|mongst us, as in those the late Synod hath pointed unto, about the subjects of Baptisme, and consociation of Churches.</P>
<P><HI>That Baptisme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e administred to the Children of Church Members who have right thereunto. And that the Communion of Churches be better im|proved amongst us.</HI> These are things we have been defective in, and therefore should be reformed in a practicall way.</P>
<P>And that we be very carefull there be no superstition amongst us, nothing <HI>supra statut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, in discipl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e</HI> no more then in worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p <HI>that nothing be Imposed as necessary unto Church-Membership, which God hath not made necessary in his wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; that there be no arbitrary way of Judging according to the private satisfaction or dis-satisfaction of mens Spirit; and that no breach be made upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t order which God hath set in his Church between the Rulers and the Ruled.</HI> That whilest we witness against su|perstition in some things, we do not fall into superstition in other things, but that the rule of Gods word be observed in all.</P>
<P>The People of God sincerely endeavouring Reformation, (yet

<P N="3">3. <HI>Vnio Reformantium</HI>: the <HI>Vnion of Reformers.</HI> I say, the Union of Reformers belongs unto this cause, for there is not any one duty more pressed by our Saviour Christ and his Apostles, then this <HI>of a holy and close Vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on amongst those that pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fess his name.</HI> Our blessed Saviour solemnly prayed for this, in the seventeenth of John <HI>that his Disciples might be one.</HI> The Apostle Exhorts unto this in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.3. <HI>endeavouring to keep the Vnity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</HI>; and he urgeth his Exhortation by an Argument taken from a seven-fold Uni|ty, wherein all sincere Christians agree, <HI>verse</HI> 4, 5. <HI>there is one body,</HI> and <HI>one Spirit,</HI> and <HI>one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God and Father of us all.</HI> Therefore endeavour to <HI>keep the Vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</HI> And he beseecheth the Corinthians to mind <HI>Vnion,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11. <HI>I beseech you Brethren by the name of the Lord Jesus, that there be no divisions amongst you, but that you be perfectly Joyned together in the same Judgment, and the same mind, and that you speak the same thing.</HI> To the same purpose he hath a most passionate Exhortation to the <HI>Philippians</HI> in <HI>Chap</HI> 2.1, 2. <HI>if there be any Consolation in Christ, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels, and mercies, fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind:</HI> and sometimes, when he saw little hopes of it upon Earth, he looks up to the Lord in heaven, &amp; beseeches him to grant this mer|cy to his Churches and People, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.5. <HI>Now the God of pati|ence, and Consolation, grant you to be like minded one to another according to Christ Jesus, that wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h one mind, and one mouth, ye may Glorifie God even the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>All which may leave a strong conviction upon us, that this be|longs

to the Cause of God, and his People, that there be a spirit of <HI>Vnion and Communion,</HI> amongst us in the <HI>things of Christ,</HI> and though it be the priviledg of some times, when the Lord shall fulfill those pro|phecies in an eminent way, that his People shall <HI>serve him with one con|sent</HI>; and that <HI>the Lord shall be one, and his name shall be one:</HI> yet this is the duty of the People of God at all times, (especially at this time &amp; in this place) to endeavour <HI>Vnion,</HI> that (so far as is possible) we may be of <HI>one judgmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, of one heart, and one way, in all the Churches of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Hence there should be <HI>no affecting of dividing names and parties a|mongst us,</HI> but all should be for this, that <HI>the Lord may be one, and his name but one.</HI></P>
<P>Hence also it is desireable that one <HI>Catechisme,</HI> one <HI>confession of Faith,</HI> and one <HI>Covenant</HI> were agreed upon and used in the severall Churches as a meanes of consent.</P>
<P>And hence again (so farr as the Lord gives liberty) there should be a frequent use of <HI>Councils</HI> amongst us to enquire after the <HI>mind of God and his word, according to the pattern in Acts.</HI> 15. and other <HI>Scrip|tures.</HI> Its true that in times of Popery, there was great abuse of <HI>Councils</HI>: yet it is as true, that in divers of the first Centuries there was great advantage to the truth by meanes of Councils, and in somewhat above the last hundred years, the work of Reformation was much promoted by the Godly Councils and conference of Reformers.

things, and therefore where there is not so full an agreement as was to be desired, <HI>it is our duty to forbear one another in love, so farr as we have attained, walking by the same rule, minding the same thing, leaving other things to God&punc; &amp; time, Phil.</HI> 3.15.16. that is now, when all Gods meanes have been used, and yet some lesser things remain controversall a|mongst pious and sober men, who agree in the maine, there is the place for <HI>Christian forbearance,</HI> not in order to <HI>separation,</HI> but in order to <HI>union,</HI> for so the Apostle joynes them together, <HI>Ephe.</HI> 4.2, 3. <HI>in lowlyness and meeknes forbearing one another in love,</HI> and endeavouring to <HI>keep the unitie of the spirit in the bond of peace.</HI> In one word; union is to be en|deavoured because the <HI>truth is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">me,</HI> and forbearance is to be used because of the weaknes of men, which yet is as far from a toleration of a false Religion, as the East is from the West.</P>
<P>Thus I have shewed you (as my weaknes was able) what the cause of God and his people amongst us is Affirmatively, it is <HI>Reformation,</HI> a <HI>progress in reformation,</HI> and the <HI>Vnion of Reformers.</HI></P>
<P>Now I shall add but this one thing more, That this cause hath a <HI>Divine right,</HI> and a <HI>Divine liberty</HI> adjoyned unto it, according to the law of liberty, the <HI>Royall Law of God,</HI> as it is called, <HI>James</HI> 2.8, 12. i. e. <HI>Right from God, and liberty from God for his people, to do their duty to God and Christ, in matters of R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ligion according to Gods word. Nor is there any power upon earth that can lawfully hinder this.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the cheif interest of New England: <HI>i. e.</HI> it is the matter of greatest importance in it self, and of greatest concernment unto us.

<P>Me thinks I look upon this present Assembly as in its proportion resembling that great assembly of the People of Israel mentioned in the text.</P>
<P>Here are the heads of our Tribes, the <HI>Honoured Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>Deputies of this Colonie,</HI> the <HI>Reverend Elders of the Churches,</HI> and a multitude of other <HI>Godly People</HI>; and I am perswaded you are affect|ed to this Cause, as that Assembly was, your desire is to see <HI>Reli|gion flourish,</HI> and the Cause of God and his People be <HI>maintained</HI> a|mongst us.</P>
<P>I need not tell you what the times are, (shaking times, and try|ing times) wherein the cause of Religion is endangered on every side. I desire onely to discharge the duty of a poor Servant of the Lord and yours, by putting you in remembrance of that which the Text here points us unto, namely, to <HI>commit this Cause to the Infinite Wisdome and good pleasure of the Lord our God, whose name is upon us, and who dwels in the midst of us,</HI> to interest him, and engage him, in the main|taining of it.</P>
<P>This was Holy counsell given to <HI>Job</HI> in the midst of his plunges and distresses, <HI>Iob</HI> 5.8, 9. <HI>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my Cause, which doth great things, and unsearchable, and mervel|lous things without number, who disappointeth the devices of the crafty, to set up on high those that are low, that such as mourne may be exalted unto safe|ty.</HI> Say (Brethren I beseech you) is not this that you would have, <HI>that the Cause of Religion, and those that love it, may be in safety?</HI> then here is the way, for all the servants of God, to <HI>commit this cause unto him which doth great things and unsearchable, and marveilous things without number,</HI> unto him who hath maintained, who doth maintaine, and will maintain <HI>his Own and his Peoples Cause</HI> according to the Counsel of his own will, for the Praise of his Glorious Grace.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Now if it be demanded. But how should we commit this Cause unto him, that he may be engaged in the maintaining of it, above all that we can ask or think?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I Answer breifly in this one direction, (which will be useful to the Honoured worthies of the <HI>General Court,</HI> and yet will also reach the meanest in the Congregation) <HI>that you commit the safety

of this cause to the Lord himselfe, in the same way as you do commit unto him the Salvation of your own soules,</HI> I say, that we do all commit this cause unto the Lord even in the same way as we do every one com|mit unto him the Salvation of our Soules. You may see the bottom of this direction in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.19. where the Apostle adviseth Christi|ans in evil times, to <HI>commit the keeping of their Soules unto God in weldo|ing as unto a Faithfull Creator.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but there are abundance here that are acquainted with this, when in the midst of Spirituall distresses you <HI>commit your Soules to the mercy of God in Christ in the promise,</HI> you do also remem|ber the way of well-doing, the way of <HI>Gods Commandements,</HI> (the <HI>narrow way to life</HI> which our Saviour hath told us of) and in that way you do commit your Soul into the hand of Jesus Christ, Sanctifying him as your onely and alsufficient Saviour.</P>
<P>As David in <HI>Psal.</HI> 31.3, 5, 6. <HI>unto thy hands I commit my Spirit, thou hast redeemed me O Lord God of truth, for thou art my rock and my fortress, for thy name sake lead me and guide me in thy way, for I hate lying Vanities, but I trust in the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</HI> Now in the very same way we should all commit the safety of the Cause of Religion to the Lord himselfe.</P>

you what the Apostle sayes, <HI>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether to the King as Supream, or unto Gover|nours sent by him.</HI></P>
<P>This is our case, his Majesty the King whom the Lord hath set up|on the throne is the Supream Civill Governour under God, and over us; and the Government setled here by the Charter of this Colonie is a subordinate Government, we are to remember our duty to both, and that <HI>for the Lords sake,</HI> for so is the will of God, that <HI>with well doing you put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</HI> as the Apostle there speaks <HI>verse</HI> 15.</P>
<P>This way of well-doing, is a narrow way, (as every way of duty is) there are by-pathes, and down-falls on either side, it is not <HI>good inten|tions,</HI> nor <HI>pia frandes</HI> that will excuse from going out of the way of well-doing, but here lyes the exercise of Godly wisdom to keep in the <HI>narrow way of well-doing</HI> shewed in the word of God, <HI>to fear God, and Honour the King, to give unto God the things that are Gods, and unto Cesar the things that are Cesars.</HI></P>
<P>The Counsel of our Saviour is to be remembred, <HI>be wise as serpents,</HI> and <HI>Innocent as Doves,</HI> the Serpents ey in the Doves head, becomes a Christian well, it is for the honour of Religion when the Servants of God cary it so as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>so as to give no occasion</HI>; so as to cut off oc|casion from them that seek occasion, that we may be able to say as he did, <HI>neither against the Temple, nor against the Law, nor against Cesar have I offended any thing.

<P>My Fathers &amp; Brethren, this is for our Admonition, and this will be for the Honour of Religion, when such as have the managing of Publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffaires, are <HI>understanding in the times to know what Israel ought to doe,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.32. not what they can do, or what they will do, but what they ought to do, not what their liberty is, but what their duty is, and what their liberty is according to their duty. <HI>To serve the times in matters of Religion we must not: we must obey God rather

then men,</HI> if it come to a stress, but in managing publick affairs in such times as Daniel lived in the matter did so require for him to be so carefull, as that no errour nor fault might be found in him. This is for our imitation.</P>

<P>In two evils of sin, there is no Election, neither is to be chosen, but in two evils of affliction the less hath the respect of a good, and may be chosen to prevent a greater evil.</P>
<P>In the question what is best, we are not only to consider what is best in it self, but what is best with reference to all the circumstances of a case.</P>

<P>And here, suffer me I beseech you to exhort you unto that which is the duty of us all, and that is, to be peaceable and <HI>faithful in Israel,</HI> ac|cording to that speech of one in a troublesome time, when there were some that said they had <HI>no part in David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.19. <HI>I am one that am peaceable and faithfull in Israel:</HI> it was the speech of a wo|man, but it may well become the wisest men and the most godly, to be <HI>peaceable and faithfull in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>First peaceable from Schisme in the Church, and sedition in the Common-Wealth, or whatsoever tends unto faction, <HI>studying to be qui|et, and every one to do their own work,</HI> and then faithfull to the cause of Religion according to our duty to God: faithfull to the King accor|ding to the oath of <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and faithfull to the Government here according to the Oath of fidelity.</P>
<P>And be you all exhorted in the words of the Holy Apostle <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.19. <HI>follow after the things which make for peace,</HI> and beware of such things as may endanger it amongst your selves, <HI>let none say that these or those are disaffected to the Cause of God and his People, because they see not in some things as others do,</HI> do not impropriate the cause of Religion to

some in opposition to others, who profess the same cause, none should speak of themselves as if they were the Godly party and eminently Saints and faithful, with despising others, nothing is more offensive amongst Christians, then to confine Religion to some singular Opini|on, as if R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ligion did mainly Center there, there were differences at Corinth, but how doth the Apostle write unto them all, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.2. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.2. <HI>to the Saints at Corinth, and to all that call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus, their Lord and ours</HI>&punc; mark that expression <HI>their Lord and ours,</HI> theirs and ours, wherin the Apostle checks the conceitedness in some that would impale and inclose the common Cause of Christ unto themselves and some peculiar Opinion of theirs, let us beware of this.</P>
<P>And the Apostle saw it needfull to admonish the best Christians, <HI>let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, or in a way of provoking one another, avoyding jealousies and uncharitable censures, being watchfull that Satan get no advantage,</HI> this also is for our Admonition, and I hope that the votes of this day will make it appear you have a due respect unto your ancient Magistrates that have born the burden and heat of the day, and that you have no undue prejudice against any that have been and may be still instruments of publick good.

Patent, which under God and the King is to be acknowledged as the foundation of the civil <HI>Goverment</HI> here.</P>
<P>It is now 35 <HI>years</HI> since I well Remember, in the <HI>year</HI> 28 that one of the first Ministers that came over into this Wilderness, giving some account of his grounds in a great Assembly of many Thou|sands at Leicester in Old-England, he mentioned this as one, the mercy of the Patent, and the largeness of the Patent, from the roy|all Authority of England, for the people here to chuse their own Ma|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">strates&punc; and to admit unto freedom such as they should think meer, and that Religion was the Principall end of this Plantation in his Majesties Royal intention and the adventurers free possession. This whole generation hath seen how good the Lord hath been unto us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this Wilderness for so many years under the <HI>Government</HI> setled here by the Patent.</P>
<P><HI>And therefore as in the matter of Religion we are to keep to the Word of God, so in the matter of the Civil Government keep to the Patent.</HI></P>
<P>And thus to <HI>be peaceable &amp; faithful in Israel,</HI> is the way of well<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">doing, wherin we are to <HI>commit the maintaining of the Cause of Religion to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord our God.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now dispatch the other two directions very breifly.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In the way of humble Prayer,</HI> commit this Cause unto God by humble fervent and frequent Prayer as we are directed in the text: <HI>let these my Prayers be nigh to the Lord our God, that he maintain the Cause of People Israel.</HI></P>
<P>When the matter requires more then ordinary help from the Lord himselfe, and yet the Lord seems to withdraw and to be asleep, then the Servants of God must awaken him by their Importunate Prayers, as the disciples in the storm did awaken our Saviour, saying, <HI>Lord save us or we Perish.</HI></P>
<P>When the People of God are faithfull to own his Cause, and care|full, neither to fall short of their duty nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o go beyond it, but keep in the narrow way of wel-doing and yet meet with such stormes of Providence as they are at their Wits end: what remaines then but Prayers &amp; tears? <HI>O our God we know not what to doe, but our eyes are un|to thee, Arise O Lord and plead thy own Cause. Awake awake O arm of the Lord as in ancient times.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Last of all, <HI>Sanctifie the Lord himselfe as the alsufficient maintainer

of this Cause,</HI> as David said, <HI>thou O Lord art the maintainer of my Lot, Psal.</HI> 16.5</P>
<P>When the Cause of Religion seemes ready to be spoiled by the professors of it, and ready to be ruined by the opposers of it, yet there is one in heaven that is able, and faithfull, and watchfull, and skilful, for the preservation of it, and therefore <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> quietness, and confi|dence, in returning and resting shall we be saved</HI> as the Prophet speaks&punc; <HI>Isai.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0.15. we should not onely submit unto, but <HI>acquiesce</HI> and rest in the Infinite Wisdom and good pleasure of God&punc; that he may doe i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, rejoicing in this, that <HI>the Lord Reignes over all</HI>&punc;</P>

<P>And be comforted in this, that the safety of the Church Militant lyes upon the hand, and belongs to the care of Jesus Christ; the ship of the Church may be endangered, it cannot be drowned so long as the Lord lives, he hath a thousand wayes (that we know not of) for him to maintain his own and his Peoples Cause.</P>
