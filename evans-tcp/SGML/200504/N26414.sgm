<P>UNTIL of late, there has been but one opinion a|mongst protestant divines, as to the application of this descriptive branch of this very interesting prophecy. They have all united in applying it to the papal power. They have said it pointed, with precision, at the Bishop of Rome: That his standing is to be seen in several prophetic features in the field to which this passage belongs, and that the same is firmly supported by other correspond|ent predictions, and prophetic aspects to be found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n other parts of this book of Daniel, and in the writings of St. Paul and of St. John.</P>
<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> late, however, Divines seem less united in the application of these prophecies to the Bishop of Rome than they, heretofore, had been accus|tomed
<PB REF="035128_0005_1000C062E7C0E528">
to be. Several reasons can be given for the change of sentiment. <HI>First,</HI> sympathy in the suffer|ings of humanity, in the excision of the papal cler|gy by the national rod: <HI>Secondly</HI> fear, lest the same fate may approach the border of the protestant houshold, so far as we may have exposed our|selves to the jealousy and fury of the lawful hus|band, by commiting fornication with the "kings of the earth:" and <HI>lastly,</HI> the mistake may have arisen from the very sudden, unexpected and violent means by which it is pleasing GOD to execute the exterminating decree upon the papal household. These things considered, there is little ground of surprise, that many protestant divines should have warped from the ancient, acknowledg|ed and just interpretations of this prophecy, and have labored to accommodate the prophecies more to the circumstances of their own safety, than what the ancient interpretation, in the light of Heaven's, present awful exposition, seemed to warrant them to do. But of what avail will the windings and twistings of mutilated and im|perfect parts of prophetic testimony be to those, whom the indignation of Heaven, by its all pen|etrating eye, is searching out!&mdash;Why hath not the falsity of papal interpretation screened the papal power? Why hath she not been able to parry the application of prophetic character from herself, by placing them to the account of Rome

The iron being gone; the iron and the clay combine, and form the ten toes of the Babylonish structure. Against this last section, the stone is now striking. By its power the image is shook, and seems likely, soon, to fall to the ground: As the downfall of mystical Babylon is reputed to be the counterpart to the introduction and prosperity of the kingdom of GOD, according to the spirit and hope of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter day glory, it is of very interesting mo|ment, to settle our minds on this important question; that our faith, and hope, and practice, may follow those leadings of mind, which truth, and not error shall dictate to the honest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>LET a fair interpretation of the vision of Daniel, contained in this chapter and expounded upon by the Angel, afford to us an answer to this enquiry.</P>
<P>IN the visions of GOD, Daniel saw, and behold from <HI>the sea,</HI> a tempestuous estate, <HI>four great beasts came up, diverse one from another.</HI> The first was <HI>like a lion and had eagles wings.</HI> This
<PB N="8" REF="035128_0008_1000C06980B3A830">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndoubtedly presents an image of the Baby|lonish empire extending its sceptre, like the wings of an eagle, over one hundred and twen|ty seven provinces. The wings were plucked. The reins of government were taken from the hands of Nebuchadnezer. He was driven from men until seven times passed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er him&punc;&mdash; He was lifted up from the earth&punc; and made to stand upon his feet as a man, and a man's heart was given unto him. Like a man, changed from the character he once wore whilst in a state of estrangment from GOD, he exemplifies his con|version in the public confession he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kes. <HI>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzer lifted up mine eyes unto Heaven and mine understanding re+turned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him that liveth forever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion&punc; and his kingdom is from generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: And he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou?</HI></P>
<P>The head of gold, the crown of the Baby|lonish empire, was removed in the excision of Belsheszer according to the interpreta|tions of the writing by Daniel.&mdash;<HI>GOD hath
<PB N="9" REF="035128_0009_1000C06B718834D0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">bered thy kingdom and finished it: thou art weighed in the ballances and art found wanting: thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. In that night was Belsha+<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>THE Medes and Persians&punc; the kings of the east, forming the two arms and the breast of Ne|buchadnezar's Image succeeded to the order and kingdom of the head of gold. <HI>And behold ano|ther beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it, and they said thus un|to it arise, devour much flesh!</HI></P>
<P>THIS kingdom is likened unto a bear because of the voraciousness of the animal; its embracing its prey as the Medes and Persians encompassed Babylon&mdash;it rose <HI>on one side</HI> of the Assyrian Em|pire, or from a state of connection with it:&mdash;it had <HI>three ribs between its teeth,</HI> denoting three eminent warriors in the Mede and Persian ar|mies; three presidents to whom the government was committed; or to three kingdoms which including itself, it held in its succession, as it were <HI>between its teeth</HI>: and the command <HI>to de|vour,</HI> presents the rapacity of its dominion and succession.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035128_0010_1000C06EB95016B0"><HI>After this I looked, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and, which had upon the back of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four wings of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the beast had also four heads, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ominion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> given to it.</HI></P>
<P>THIS language paints to us the person, rapid strides and support of the Grecian warrior, Al|exander the Great. Like a leopard, spotted, sleek, and rapid in its movements, so was Alex|ander. The four wings upon the back doubly express the rapidity of his movements: the four pillars of his armies, on which he rested, are also represented by the four heads which this beast is said to carry: and to whom the dominion was eventually left.</P>
<P><HI>After this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong ex|ceedingly; and it had great iron teeth, it devour|ed and break in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns.</HI></P>
<P>THIS power is undoubtedly the power of Heathen Rome. It had the dominion in the days of the crucifixion of our LORD. At the hands of this power the LORD of life was put to death; moved thereto by the implacable enmi|ty of the Jewish Rulers. Over the whole world this dreadful and terrible beast maintained its

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> properties of the <HI>little horn</HI> are, by all, imputable to the papal power. His empire, at first, was very small.

<P>THIS exploit we now live to see performed. The convulsive scenes of European conflict are loosening the stones of this papal fabric; and more and more sapping the foundation of this antichristian structure.</P>
<P>THE ten kings are loosing their dominion. The subjects of these papal branches are uniting in the common enmity, and with common con|sent, seem willing that this antichristian power should be consumed by the breath of that irre|sistable flame in which GOD is breathing forth his indignation upon it; waiting for the fatal and deadly blow this power is to receive at the <HI>brightness of his coming.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035128_0013_1000C0739FCE3640">THE place will not admit of so much as a glance at the many and variegated, and re|peated prophetic characters in which this papal power, that is now falling, is spoken of, and re|presented as to fall in these days. Few can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ignorant that the Old Testament and the New, are full of declarations to this point. The sins of this mystical Babylon are recounted. Her persecutions and bloodshed, her wearying of the saints of the Most High, and the universal mer|chandise of her ungodly traffic; and the circulation of the filthiness of her Babylonish cup, throughout all the regions of the mystical family, are repre|sented as abominations which call aloud for the perdition to be poured forth, to which she is ap|pointed in GOD'S great decree. <HI>Rejoice over h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thou Heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, for GOD hath avenged you of her. And a mighty An|gel took up a stone like a great mill stone, and cast it into the sea, saying, thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee, and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee, and the sound of a mill stone shall be heard no more at all in thee. And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the

<P>THE subject leads our thoughts</P>
<P N="2">II. TO enquire by what means this apostate&punc; papal, antichristian power is to be removed?</P>
<P>FOR information on the subject we must make our appeal to the word of GOD; and to the e|vents of providence which are now passing before us. In doing this we not only justify ourselves as following the best sources of instruction we can be favored with, but avoid the weight of the curse which lies at the door of those who consider not the work of the LORD, nor regard the operations of his hands.</P>
<P>THE information to be obtained from the oracles of GOD is general; reserving the fuller manifestation to the day in which the mighty seat of antichristion desolation shall be wrought. In fact, some part of every predic|tion is kept in the dark! It was never the de|sign of Heaven that its predictions should be
<PB N="15" REF="035128_0015_1000ADEA41883258">
fully understood until they were accomplished.&mdash; Men might combine to defeat them, and thus wage an unnecessary war with GOD. Men are left to the freedom of their own will, and un|constrained, seem left to fulfill the will of GOD by the thoughts they entertain, by the words they speak, and by the actions they perform. When the event predicted is performed then we behold with admiration the perfect coincidence of the event with the prediction it was or|dained to fulfil.</P>
<P>IN the interpretation of Daniel respecting the Babylonish image, pointing to the section re|presenting the papal power, in the feet and toes which were <HI>part of iron and part of clay; thou sawest said he till that a stone was cut out with|out hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and of clay and break them to pieces: then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor: and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them, and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And, whereas, thou sawest iron mixed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> clay, they shall mingle themselves with the
<PB N="16" REF="035128_0016_1000ADD3855EB5C8">
seed of men!</HI> a union being formed between the sons of GOD and the sons of men: <HI>but they shall not cleave one to another,</HI> no particular attachments, more than ministers to private accomodation between the things of GOD and of men; <HI>even as iron is not mixed with clay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great GOD hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof is sure.</HI></P>
<P>AND in the text, the declaration is: <HI>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his do|minion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</HI>&mdash; In Thes. II. 2nd&mdash; it is written respecting the <HI>man of sin, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called GOD, or that is worshipped; so that he as GOD sitteth in the temple of GOD, shewing himself that he is GOD; and then, shall that wicked be revealed; whom the LORD shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.</HI></P>
<P>THE antichristian power, falling in the char|acter of mystical Babylon, affords constant ground of exultation, on the part of those who have
<PB N="17" REF="035128_0017_1000C075ED104140">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en made to feel the weight of her rod. <HI>Re|ward her even as she rewarded you, and double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|to her double, according to her works, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which she hath filled, fill to her double.</HI></P>
<P>MANY exultations, are recorded, as springing out of the event of the downfall of mystical Babylon of which there is not now time fully to speak.</P>
<P>SUFFER me, in this place, to read in your hear|ing a brief sketch of the sentiments of the lear|ned of the day, on this subject It is taken from the body of a discourse preached by Doct. Liv|ingston, before the members of the New-York missionary society, conven'd on the 23d. of April in that City. The pamphlet I hold in my hand&punc; page 45.</P>
<P><Q>THE dispensations of providence, in connec|ion with the sure word of prophecy, justly raise our expectations, and may be considered as unequivocal tokens of signal success.&mdash; What ever may be the period from which the rise of antichrist is to be dated, it is evi|dent his usurpations and tyranny are draw|ing to a close. That wicked power which has so long resisted the progress of the gospel, but which for some time has been gradually consuming&punc; will soon be destroyed by the bright|ness

of the Redeemer's coming. The last strug|gles of the monster may be violent, and his expiring agonies protracted, but he is cer|tainly dying. The western and eastern an|tichrist, which with their combined influence, are perhaps considered in scripture as one, arose nearly at the same time and will fall to|gether.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE vials of wrath, now pouring upon those nations which gave their aid and sup|port to the man of sin: the desolations of war, the revolutions, terrors, and convulsions, unrecorded before in history, announce the approach of some period <HI>new and interesting.</HI> The REDEEMER is shaking the nations, and his people hope, it is to prepare the way for his coming.

poisonous, thro' the potion infused, by North's insidious hand. The Gaspee schooner was in flames; the king's authority was defied; and with arms in hand an appeal was made to Heaven for the justice of our cause. Twenty years expired, and these United States found themselves independent. Their standards were planted, where just now the proud insignia of the enemy braved the winds; threating never to leave our coasts until the keys of our graine|ries and of our commerce were laid at their feet!
