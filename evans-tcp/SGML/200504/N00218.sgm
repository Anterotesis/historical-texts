<HEAD>A Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord Jesus Christ witnessed a good Confession, at the time when he said, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the World, that I should bear witness unto the Truth; and he taketh notice of it, to the praise and high commendation of the Church in <HI>Pergamus,</HI> that they held fast his name, and had not denied his <HI>Faith.</HI> Nor are they worthy of the name of Chri|stians, who, though the Lord by his Providence call them publickly to own the Truth they have professed, shall nevertheless refuse to declare what they believe, as to those great and fundamental Principles in the Doctrine of Christ, the knowledge whereof is necessary unto Salvation. VVe find how ready the Apostle was to make <HI>A Confession of his Faith;</HI> though for that hopes sake he was accused, and put in chains. And the Martyrs of Jesus, who have laid down their lives in bearing witness to the truth, against the Infidelity, Idola|try, Heresy, Apostasie of the world, when Pagan, Arian, or overspread with Popish darkness: ha|ving
<PB REF="000280_0004_0FA45C1B758D32B0">
their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace, were free and forward in their Te|stimony, confessing the Truth, yea sealing it with their blood. <HI>With the heart man believeth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth Con|fession is made unto Salvation,</HI> Rom. <HI>10.10.</HI> Nor is there a greater evidence of being in a state of sal|vation, then such a Confession, if made in times or places where men are exposed to utmost suffering upon that account. <HI>1 Joh. 4.15.</HI> And if Con|fession of Faith be, in some cases, of such impor|tance and necessity, as hath been expressed; it must needs be in it self, a work pleasing in the sight of God, for his Servants to declare unto the world, what those Principles of Truth are, which they have received, and are (by the help of Christ) pur|posed to live and dye in the stedfast Profession of. Some of the Lords Worthyes have been of renown among his People in this respect; especially <HI>Irenaeus</HI> and <HI>Athanasius</HI> of old, and of latter times <HI>Beza,</HI> all whose (not to mention others) <HI>Confessions,</HI> with the advantage which the Church of God hath received thereby, are famously known. And it must needs tend much to the honour of the dear and blessed name of the Lord Jesus, in case many Churches do joyn together in their Testimony. How signally the Lord hath owned the <HI>Confession</HI> of the four gene|ral <HI>Synods</HI> or <HI>Councils</HI> for the suppression of the Heresyes of those times, needs not to be said, since no man can be ignorant thereof, that hath made it
<PB REF="000280_0005_0FA45C1D5593DD60">
concern to be acquainted with things of this nature. The Confession of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> of the <HI>Walden|ses,</HI> and of the Reformed Protestant Churches a|broad (which also, to shew what Harmony in re|spect of Doctrine there is among all sincere Profes|sors of the Truth, have been published in one Vo|lume) all these have been of singular use, not only to those that lived in the Ages when these Declarati|ons were emitted, but unto Posterity, yea unto this day.</P>
<P>There have been some who have reflected upon these <HI>New-English Churches</HI> for our defect in this matter, as if our Principles were unknown; wher|as it is well known, that as to matters of Doctrine we agree with other Reformed Churches: Nor was it that, but what concerns Worship and Dis|cipline, that caused our Fathers to come into this wilderness, whiles it was a land not sown, that so they might have liberty to practice accordingly. And it is a ground of holy rejoycing before the Lord, that now there is no advantage left for those that may be disaffected towards us, to object any thing of that nature against us. For it hath plea|sed the only wise God so to dispose in his Providence, as that the Elders and Messengers of the Churches in the Colony of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> did, by the Call and Encouragement of the honoured General Court, meet together <HI>Sept. 10. 1679.</HI> This Synod at their second Session, which was <HI>May 12. 1680.</HI> consulted and considered of a
<PB REF="000280_0006_0FA45C1D6E9B2AE8">
Confession of Faith. That which was consented unto by the Elders and Messengers of the <HI>Con|gregational Churches</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who met at the <HI>Savoy</HI> (being for the most part, some small vari|ations excepted, the same with that which was a|greed upon first by the Assembly at <HI>Westminster,</HI> &amp; was approved of by the Synod at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> Anno <HI>1648.</HI> as also by a general <HI>Assembly</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>) was twice publickly read, examined and approved of: that little variation which we have made from the one, in compliance with the other may be seen by those who please to compare them. But we have (for the main) chosen to express our selves in the words of those Reverend Assemblyes, that so we might not only with one heart, but with one mouth glorifie God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>As to what concerns <HI>Church-Government,</HI> we refer to the Platform of Discipline agreed upon by the Messengers of these Churches <HI>Anno 1648.</HI> &amp; solemnly owned &amp; confirmed by the late Synod.</P>
<P>What hours of Temptation may overtake these Churches, is not for us to say. Only the Lord doth many times so order things, that when his People have made a good <HI>Confession</HI> they shall be put upon the trial one way or other, to see whether they have (or who among them hath not) been sincere in what they have done. The Lord grant that the loins of our minds may be so girt about with Truth, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</P>

<P>ALthough the Light of Nature, and the Works of Creation and Provi|dence, do so far manifest the Good|ness, Wisdom and Power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will, which is necessary unto Salvation: Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his Will unto his Church; and afterwards for the better preser|ving and propagating of the Truth, and for the

<P>The Authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, depend|eth not upon the Testimony of any man or Church, but wholly upon God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.</P>

esteem of the holy Scripture. And the heavenliness of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the majesty of the Style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans Salvation, the the many other incomparable excellencies, and the intire perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; Yet notwithstanding, our full perswasion and assurance of the infallible Truth and Divine Authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.</P>

<P>The whole Counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salva|tion, Faith and Life, is either expresly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary conse|quence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whe|ther by new Revelations of the Spirit, or Tra|ditions of men. Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word: And that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God and Government of the Church, common to humane actions and Soci|eties,
<PB N="5" REF="000280_0011_0FA45C23CAC60A98">
which are to be ordered by the Light of Nature, and Christian Prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word, which are al|ways to be observed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: yet those things which are necessary to be known, belie|ved and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understand|ing of them&middot;</P>

<P>The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native Language of the People of God of old) and the New-Testament in Greek (which at the time of writing of it was most gene|rally known to the Nations) being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Authentical; so as in all Controversies of Reli|gion the Church is finally to appeal unto them. But because these Original Tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and interest in the Scriptures, and are

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>Their ability to doe good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ: And that they may be enabled there|unto, besides the graces they have already re|ceived, there is required an actual influence of the same holy Spirit to work in them to will and to doe, of his good pleasure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.</P>

<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of Faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficul|tyes before he be partaker of it; yet being inabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means attain thereunto: And there|fore it is the duty of every one to give all dili|gence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be inlarged in peace &amp; joy in the holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to looseness.</P>

<P>All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lords Table, and can|not without great sin against him, whilst they remain such, partake of these holy Mysteryes, or be admitted thereunto; yea whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, eating and drinking Judge|ment to themselves.</P>

<P>THE Bodies of men after death return to dust and see corruption, but their souls (which neither dye nor sleep) having an im|mortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them, the souls of the righteous be|ing then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies: And the souls of the wicked are cast into Hell, where they

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. Of the Last Judgement.</HEAD>
<P>GOD hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World in righteohsness by Jesus Christ, to whom all power and Judgement is given of the Father; in which day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall ap|pear before the Tribunal of Christ to give an ac|count of their thoughts, words and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.</P>

<P>The end of Gods appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the Elect, and of his Ju|stice in the damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient: for then shall the righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory, with everlasting reward in the presence of the Lord, but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eter|nal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</P>

<P>As Christ would have us to be certainly per|swaded that there shall be a Judgement, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity; so will he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake of all carnal security, and be alwayes watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come, and may be ever prepared to say Come Lord Jesus, come quickly. Amen.</P>
