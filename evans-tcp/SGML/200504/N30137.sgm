<HEAD>An Act for Emitting and Making Current, <HI>Ninety Thou|sand Pounds,</HI> Current Money of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in Bills of Credit.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS Tobacco, the only Staple of this Province, and the principal Dependance of its Inhabitants, hath for several Years past produced so little, that several of the People, not able to get the Necessaries of Life, by the Fruits of their Labour, have been obliged to desert their Habitations; and many more must follow their Example, or be constrained to attempt some other Way of living, less advantageous to the Trade of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> their Mother-Country, than making Tobacco, unless some Expedient can be found, to re|move the Difficulties under which they have long laboured:</P>
<P>AND whereas, the most probable Means to enable the People to discharge their Taxes, and other Engagements now payable in Tobac|co, otherwise; and to destroy such ordinary and unmerchantable To|baccos, which serve only to clog the Markets, and to depreciate the best Sorts of that Commodity, as well as to put the People in a Condi|tion to carry on the Tobacco Trade, to the Advantage of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and this Province, is to establish a <HI>Paper Currency,</HI> or Bills of Credit, upon a sinking Fund: Wherefore it is prayed, that it may be Enacted:</P>
<P><HI>AND be it Enacted, by the Right Honourable the Lord Proprie|tary, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Upper and Lower Houses of Assembly, and the Authority of the same.</HI> That Bills of Cre|dit, to the Value of Ninety Thousand Pounds, current Money of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> according to an Act of Parliament, made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of the late Queen <HI>Anne, For Ascertaining the Rates of Foreign Coins in the Plantations,</HI> to circulate for Thirty One Years, from the Commencement of this Act, shall be printed and struck, in Manner and Form following:</P>
