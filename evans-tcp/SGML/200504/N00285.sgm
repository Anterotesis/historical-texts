</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Psalm is thought by some Interpreters to be pen|ned by <HI>David</HI> after the An|gel of God had appeared to him, and designed the place where he should build an Altar at present, and where afterward the Temple was to be built by <HI>Solomon,</HI> pointing, as it were, to the place which the Lord had chosen to cause his Name to dwell there; as it is said, <HI>Deut.</HI> 12. 11. This they like|wise think was after the <HI>Israelites</HI> had been afflicted with three years Famine, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21. and with three dayes Pestilence, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. which might be the reason of those words in the second verse, as <HI>Junius</HI> concludes, <HI>Out of Sion the perfection of beauty God hath shined:</HI> For now it is de|clared by God himself, that the light of

his favour is restored to his People, after the darkness and calamities of former times were passed over. The Psalmist takes this occasion to inform his holy peo|ple, how they ought to carry on his Wor|ship, by not resting in the external, and ceremonial, but rather attending to the moral, and spiritual part thereof, <HI>ver.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 15&punc; the former in comparison of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being in a sense to be rejected, and laid a|side without it, as insignificant in the ac|count of God, if it be not accompanied with the other: And hereupon is a di|gression made unto the wicked in the 16 <HI>verse,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell them, that they can expect no benefit by attendance upon the Cere|monial Worship of God, so long as they hate to be reformed in their lives, which the covenant of God principally requires: The more to affect this sort of men, the Psalmist person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n their wicked words and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rom <HI>ver.</HI> 17. to the 22<HI>d.</HI> where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cal them from their sinful wayes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ring them back to re|pentance by the ear of Gods inevitable wrath in that verse, and then shuts up the whole discourse of the Psalm by a solemn
<PB N="3" REF="000362_0010_0FA55554F9C6C580">
Epiphonema, in the last verse, consisting of two parts: in the first of which is shewn how acceptable to God is spiritual Worship, he that sacrificeth praise glorifi|eth me; in the latter is seen how profita|ble to man is moral obedience; <HI>To him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the Salvation of God:</HI> These are the last words of the Psalm, but are not of least moment and importance, for they contain the sum and substance of the whole Psalm foregoing.</P>
<P>The Textual difficulties in this last clause of the verse, are not above three or four, and in a few more words will be all cleared.</P>
<P>If it be enquired therefore&punc; <HI>First,</HI> what is meant by the Conversation? It is An|swered, that according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Original word, nothing is intended therein, but the way or course of a mans life, according to the Metaphor usual in the Scriptures, where a mans works or the course and frame of his life is compared to a way or path that leads from one place to another; with this difference only, that as there are
<PB N="4" REF="000362_0011_0FA55555C0963908">
many places in this lower world whither men may repair, so there are many paths or wayes that directly lead thereunto; but as to the other World, there are but two places to which all our actions tend, and to one of which they will certainly bring all that persist therein, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> either Heaven or Hell, Life or Death, Salvation or Dam|nation: such as are our works here, will be our reward hereafter. The way which we have designed to our selves, and per|sist in, will certainly in the issue bring us to the good which is promised, or the e|vil threatned in the Word of God. There is no other word in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> to express our conversation but this of our way. In the <HI>Greek Testament,</HI> there is a word pro|perly answers Conversation; which comes from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Versari <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, illuc,</HI> as Horse-men in a Battle, that turn this way&punc; and that way, as occasion serves: yet still aims to carry on the main design at first intended. Thus the Apostle saith, he was made all things to all men, that he might by all means save some, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 20, 21, 22. So must every Christian, in a
<PB N="5" REF="000362_0012_0FA55557ECF31868">
sense, shape his course according as the Wind and Current of providence shifts, or sets this way or that way; by doing, and suffering, bearing, and forbearing keep on in the way of obedience; joyn|ing the wisdom of the Serpent, with the innocence of the Dove: or as the Sea|mans Phrase is, when they pass through difficult and dangerous passages on either hand, aloof for one, and bear up for ano|ther, yet still keeping on in the direct way that leads to the Heaven of rest and happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What is it to order our way aright?</P>
<P>The Hebrew word properly signifies to put, dispose: <HI>Mercer</HI> renders the Word <HI>Arte, cur&acirc;, &amp; ordine ponere, aut disponere;</HI> and therefore it is fitly rendered in our Translation, order aright. It is used to express a <HI>singularis observantia,</HI> in refe|rence either to the acts either of the bo|dy or mind. There is need of a great deal of skill and artifice, as well as ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and industry in the ordering the frame of our lives: Not to seek the first&punc;
<PB N="6" REF="000362_0013_0FA55557F658D398">
that should be left to the second place: as our Saviour bids us <HI>seek first the Kingdom of heaven, and the righteousness thereof,</HI> Mat. 6. 33. He that seeks other things in the first place, and leaves the care of his Salvation, with <HI>Felix,</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> discour|sed of <HI>Righteousness, Temperance and Judg|ment to come,</HI> to a more convenient season, doth not order his way aright, for that will bring him to an ill end at last. Thus <HI>Jehu</HI> ordered his way aright to the King|dom of the ten Tribes, but quite wrong as to the Kingdom of God, when all his care was to walk in the way of <HI>Jeroboam's</HI> Idolatry, but took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of <HI>Israel</HI> with all his heart, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 10. 31.</P>
<P>This ordering the way aright may im|ply a threefold act of a Christian: <HI>First,</HI> of the mind, to judge and apprehend, what is the right, or the wrong way that lead|eth unto life. To discern what is the principal thing to be desired. <HI>Secondly,</HI> an act of the affection to embrace, desire that way which is the most necessary and excellent. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> An act of the Will,
<PB N="7" REF="000362_0014_0FA55558C8E75BA0">
for purpose and resolution to pursue that which is in it self most necessary and de|sirable. <HI>One thing have I desired of the Lord,</HI> (saith <HI>David</HI>) <HI>and that will I seek after,</HI> Psal. 27. 4. And our Saviour tells us, <HI>There is but one thing necessary,</HI> and he commends <HI>Mary</HI> for making her choice of that, and not cumbring her self with o|ther things that were not necessary.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> What is that Salvation of God which they shall see, who order their way aright? By salvation unto the people of God under the dispensation of the old Te|stament, was generally signified, preser|vation or deliverance from any temporal evil that at any time they were pressed withal with obtaining the contrary good. Yet so as thereby, in a spiritual, and sub|lime sense was signified, Deliverance from all evil both of sin and judgment, tempo|ral or eternal, which they had made them|selves obnoxious unto by their disobedi|ence, with the obtaining the favour of God towards them in the peaceable en|joyment of the good land, which they were possessed of, till they came to obtain
<PB N="8" REF="000362_0015_0FA55559758D1758">
happiness of Gods Kingdom in the other World, of which the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was a standing type and shadow. So Salvation is most frequently taken in the old Te|stament; The obtaining of all that good both temporal and eternal, which was ne|cessarily required to make any people or person, prosperous and happy, with deli|verance from all the evil which is contra|ry thereunto.</P>
<P>This is called Gods Salvation, not only as that which is in it self most eminent, or excellent; as excellent Cedars, are called Cedars of God: but because, 1. It is a Salvation which God only can give: as the Psalmist saith, elsewhere, <HI>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elp of man,</HI> Psal.60. And so he speaks of looking un|to those Hills, from which cometh his help. And it is Gods salvation which his People seek for; and therefore <HI>David</HI> of|ten stiles God <HI>his Salvation and his Deli|verance.</HI> 2. A Salvation which God will give: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Hebrew it is, <HI>I will cause him to see the salvation of God,</HI> which is to note the effectualness of this promise&punc;
<PB N="9" REF="000362_0016_0FA5555B21594EC8">
though it may seem never so improbable, and almost impossible; yet God will make them that order their way aright, to see his salvation at such a time. 3. It is also more emphatically expressed in the third person; <HI>Such a one shall be made to see the salvation of God.</HI> It was a time of great extremity in <HI>Samaria,</HI> in <HI>Jehoram's</HI> time: Death as well as Dearth was come upon them: There is a word of Salvation comes from the Lord by the mouth of the Pro|phet; which speaks of great plenty that should be forthwith in <HI>Samaria;</HI> God made it good, but the unbelieving Lord, though he saw it with his eyes, yet he never felt the good of Salvation, because he did not order his way aright, to give Glory to the God of Israel, by believing the word which he spake by his Prophet.</P>
<P><HI>Junius </HI> renders the word <HI>See,</HI> by enjoy|ing; for so the sence of seeing, which is the most noble, active of all the senses, is frequently put for seeling, enjoying, ob|taining; as it is in <HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 6. where the unbelieving wretches that trust in an arm of Flesh, whose hearts depart away from
<PB N="10" REF="000362_0017_0FA5555BB9F58E10">
God, are said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cursed; and shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Desart, <HI>that shall not see when God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ometh.</HI> If we observe the conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ovidence in the former as well as in the present age, we shall find the people of God often reduced to those streights that none but the Almigh|ty could grant them Salvation from.</P>
<P>The words thus opened, do very natu|rally, and of themselves run into this pro|position or point of Doctrine:</P>
<Q>Doct. A right ordered Conversation is the direct and necessary way for any peo|ple or person to obtain Gods Salvation.</Q>
<P>The best improvement of this Doctrine will be, 1. By shewing wherein consists a well ordered Conversation. 2. By lay|ing open the salvation which such shall see. 3. Confirming this truth by such instances, and reasons, as may be found in our experience. 4. By answering such ob|jections as look another way. 5. By ma|king such Application, as the nature of the truth requires.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="000362_0018_0FA5555E8D171EB8">
1. For the first of these, there are sun|dry things necessary to a well ordered Conversation.</P>
<P N="1">1. A good beginning, or a sound prin|ciple within. He that doth not begin well, will never end well, if he will ne|ver alter his course. For he that sets out in a wrong way, the longer he continues therein, is gone further from the desired end (if Gods Salvation be that which was aimed at) then at his first entrance there|into. For so Christ tells the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> that their proselytes are twofold more the Children of Hell, than they were before. They must not set out in the Flesh, that ever intend or hope to end in the Spirit. A good Tree is absolutely needful to good fruit; and so is a good heart unto a good life. If the Fountain be not clean, it will never send forth good Water in its Streams: for as <HI>James tells us, The same Fountain can never send forth sweet water and bitter.</HI> The heart must be chan|ged before the words and works will be found pure and perfect; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,
<PB N="12" REF="000362_0019_0FA5555EAFB36148">
the hands work, and the feet walks: the Index in a Clock points to those figures without, that the wheels within move un|to. The heart is the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> in this little World, that carries all the other <HI>Orbs</HI> of the <HI>thoughts, affections, senses,</HI> and <HI>Organs</HI> along with it. Since the <HI>Fall,</HI> the frame of every mans heart is bent to evil, <HI>only to evil, and that continually;</HI> and there|fore the whole frame of nature must be changed and turned about, before any mo|tion can be made toward this salvation of God. There must be a gracious disposi|tion or inclination of the <HI>Will,</HI> whereby it comes to be determined to well-doing, before any hope of Salvation will be brought about: For as <HI>Ames</HI> saith well, It is the heart or will that is the proper seat and subject of virtue: Because, <Q><HI>Vo|luntas, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a se nec a ratione sufficienter determinata est <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d bonum ergo opus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">abet suapr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pra dispositione ad recte agendum.</HI> i. e. the <HI>Will</HI> is neither of it self, nor by the force of reason sufficiently deter|mined unto good, therefore it stands in need of a proper disposition of its own

to incline it to well-doing.</Q> Take any of the children of men of the most to|wardly natural disposition, let him be ad|vantaged by the most likely way of edu|cation, both by precepts of vertue and good examples leading thereunto. Lay before him as many Arguments, Reasons as may be of force to convince the most obstinate mind, and obdurate heart, so as he shall be forced to acknowledge that the precept is holy, just and good: the way directly tending unto life; yet till the heart be changed and over-poured by a work of supernatural grace, the life will alwayes be found barren of any good fruit, void of holiness, and sincere obedi|ence: yea many times none are found more vitious in their lives than such as have had the best advantage for piety, by their education? None ever proved worse Children than those who have had the best of men for their Parents, till their hearts were changed by the power of divine Grace, if ever they attained thereunto.

<P>This seems to be the reason why the Scripture lays so much weight upon the

uprightness, and obedience of the heart: <HI>My Son give me thy heart; And above all keepings keep the heart, for out of it are the issues of life,</HI> that is, the great wheel that carries all other powers and faculties along with it.

It will be&punc; but as a stone that may be by Engines forced upward, or as water heated by the fire, which retains their innate qualities, to which they will soon return again, and to that place of their center. Therefore he that would have his way set right, must begin with his heart, and get that changed, and put into a right frame, and then all the rest will follow. He that made the heart at first, and formeth the spirit of man with|in him, must also make the heart anew, and renew a right spirit within every man, must renew it again: This is the sense of the Church of God in all ages as to this article of Religion, <HI>Turn us O God of our</HI>

<P N="1">1. As to what is past, his way is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Repentance from all dead works formerly committed, which cannot be

For that man will never walk aright in the way of Repentance&punc; that is not by Faith first reconciled unto God. As the Scripture tells us, without Faith it is impossible to please God; and whatever is not of Faith is sin. <HI>David</HI> complains, <HI>that it was as a Sword within his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nes, while they said unto him, where is thy God?</HI> if at any time we have lost ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hold of God, it will never be obtained a|gain without the renewed actings and ex|ercise of Faith: And as he that in the state of Nature and unregeneracy is estran|ged from God, can never be reconcile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto him without the Act of Faith un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ting of him to the Lord Jesus, as a Surety Head and Saviour, in whom the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well pleased.

who as a living foundation and root, doth quicken all those who are as lively stones built upon him, and as living Branches united unto him, as to the true Olive. Re|pentance therefore is another part of our way together with faith: These two are inseparable Companions in the condition of the Gospel: These two are alwayes joyned together in the Doctrine and way of Salvation. Sinners that would enjoy the Salvation of God, must as well undo the evil that is past by true Repentance, as en|deavour to do that which is right for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time that is to come. Forgiveness is as freely extended by God, as a God of all grace, as it was ever declared in the pro|mise, or covenant of Gods grace; yet tis added, only acknowledge thine iniquity. And though the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be many instances of Gods pardoning grace extended to great sinners, yet it is no particular instance, of any such act of Grace from God, where there was no certain sign of true Repen|tance. <HI>David'</HI>s heart went too intempe|rately out toward <HI>Absalom:</HI> that he seems resolved to have pardoned him, though
<PB N="20" REF="000362_0027_0FA5556B8BB2B870">
he had never given any real evidence of sincere Repentance. But the pardoning of Fratricide without repentance made him the readier to adventure upon Pari|cide afterward. God seemed as forward and willing to pardon <HI>David</HI> as ever he did any of the Sons of Men, and accepts of as little evidence for Repentance; yet that which was, was sincere, and there|fore sufficient, <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>I have sinned.</HI> Confession, as that was circumstanced&punc; implied all the other parts of Repen|tance.</P>
<P>And seeing we are apt to sin daily, and are directed to pray daily for the pardon of our sins, so Repentance is a work, it is never out of season, while the Children of God carry a body of death along with them.

that would be found as a new lump, must daily be purging out the old leven. While we are in the World we shall have occasi|on of commerce with the Idolatrous, Co|vetous, Fornicators of this World, or else as the Apostle sayes, <HI>we must go out of the world,</HI> for fear of defilement; therefore we must daily cleanse our selves in the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vor of Repentance, as was the custom of the <HI>Jews</HI> to wash and be clean, as to their outward man, after they came from the market.

People, in any time of distress and dan|ger, when they needed Gods Salvation, to sanctifie a Fast, and call a solemn As|sembly, to make their peace with God by Repentance of sins that were past, and by entring into a new engagement, by re|newing their Covenant for their good abearing, for the time to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. The right ordering our Conversati|on as to what is future, consists in new obedience. Attending on the duties of Religion and Righteousness. To frame their doings so as to turn to their God, from whom afore time they have fallen by their iniquity: yet now they must come up to a resolution to do so no more. The wrath of God which is revealed from Heaven, is against the ungodliness, and unrighteousness of Men, and therefore the way to enjoy the Salvation of God, and avoid the wrath which is to come, requires us in the first place to live godly in the present World, of which there are two Branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. A religious observance of all the du|ties of Gods Worship. God expects to
<PB N="23" REF="000362_0030_0FA5556E721A4F28">
be worshipped after a due manner by all those that desire to see his Salvation. That God who is the Creator of the ends of the Earth, alwayes required homage from the Inhabitants thereof; and those Fami|lies are destined to his Curse and Venge|ance, that live in the neglect thereof, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Prophet <HI>Jeremy</HI> speaks, <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. 25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</HI> Such therefore as restrain Prayer, and call not on the Name of the Lord, are so far from seeing his Salvation, that they may justly fear, they shall feel his Indignation. <HI>Abraham</HI> was called <HI>the Friend of God:</HI> for whose sake he reproved Kings, giving them in special charge not to work him any harm, where ever he came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|journ. The first thing you hear of him is his building an Altar, and calling on the Name of the Lord, as may be seen in the first part of his Pilgrimage, <HI>Gen.</HI> 12. 7, 8. <HI>&amp;</HI> 13. 4, 18. Nor was <HI>Abram</HI> the first who was noted for this Religious care of Gods Worship. For we read that <HI>Noah,</HI> as soon as ever he came out of the Ark, built an
<PB N="24" REF="000362_0031_0FA5556F44A1BAE0">
Altar, and offered Sacrifices thereon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of those few clean Beasts that were left a|live after the great Deluge. Probably he might conceive, that it was in great part for the neglect thereof, that a <HI>D</HI>eluge of Water was brought upon the World. For ever since the dayes of <HI>Seth,</HI> when first there were found People enough to make publick Assemblies, <HI>they began to call upon the Name of the Lord,</HI> and so continued till the degenerate Off-spring of the suc|ceeding Generation, had through their great impiety in a manner wholly laid a|side.</P>
<P>In like manner was it observed as most commendable in <HI>David,</HI> that as soon as ever he was settled in his Kingdom, the first publick design he takes in hand, is the bringing home the Ark of God to the Tent which he had prepared for it at <HI>Je|rusalem;</HI> as well knowing that his esta|blishing the Worship of God, would be the directest means to establish the King|dom in his possession, for the work of God had been sadly neglected, or but slightly managed, ever since <HI>Saul</HI> was called to

the Kingdom. <HI>Jeroboam</HI> that had so large a promise for settling of the Kingdom in his prosperity, yet lays the Foundation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s and their ruin in his Idolatry, and false Worship: which proved in like manner a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atal stumbling block in the way of all the succeeding Kings, though in many things else, never so hopeful and commen|dable in themselves. It was the neglect of the Worship of God that lost <HI>Jehu</HI> and his Family the Kingdom, and which at last cost the ten Tribes their Countrey. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or how zealous soever <HI>Jehu</HI> was in abo|lishing the Worship of <HI>Baal,</HI> he was as re|miss as the rest in setting up the Worship of the Lord. For tis said, <HI>He took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord,</HI> it must in a special manner be understood, as to the I|dolatry of the <HI>golden Calves,</HI> for in other things, he was careful very exactly to ful|fil that will of the Lord, as in punishing the house of <HI>Ahab,</HI> as the Lord had com|manded him. Thus was it foretold by the Prophet <HI>Joel, That whosoever called on the Name of the Lord should be saved.</HI> What was it that ruined the Gospel

This was <GAP DESC="foreign">, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Mede</HI> calls it in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Then if you would your selves, or de|sire that yours should see the salvation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God, look to maintain and carry on the Worship of God in your Assemblies, Fa|milies, and in your own hearts and cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|sets. The Worship of God was ordered aright in <HI>David's</HI> and <HI>Solomon's</HI> time, and in the first part of <HI>Rehoboam's</HI> Reign; And so long things went well; but when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> and his People, forsook the Lay of the Lord, God forsook them, and let them in the hand of their Enemies: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did any of the following Kings ever so the Salvation of God longer than they were careful to maintain and carry on the true Worship of God, as may be seen in the History of <HI>Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezechia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Josiah,</HI> Kings of <HI>Judah:</HI> For by the I|dolatry and false Worship of the other

Kings, their Kingdoms became low and broken, till at last they were broken to pieces, were carried Captive to <HI>Babylon,</HI> and were never restored to the honour of a Kingdom afterward.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second part of our Religious care must be to maintain Purity and Ho|liness in heart and life; that the Holy God not only be Worshipped, but that he be worshipped in an holy manner: Reverend and Holy is his Name; and he will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nctified in all them that draw near unto him, else he will sanctifie himself upon them; and they shall by that means be far from seeing the Salvation of God; as was the case of them that offered strange fire upon <HI>Gods Altar.</HI> Thus the Prophet <HI>Haggai</HI> tells them, and convinces them out of the Law, that the impurity of their hearts and lives, rendred all they did, as to the external part of Gods Worship, unclean: For where the mind and conscience is de|filed and unclean, all the service that such perform must needs be defiled thereby. It is the lifting up of clean hands that must obtain Gods Salvation: he threatens
<PB N="28" REF="000362_0035_0FA5557AF15ACBD0">
to hide his eyes from beholding those hands that are defiled with blood, or any other wickedness: for which our sinceri|ty in our worship and obedience, all man|ner of wickedness and impiety may be carried on under the outward form of re|ligious Worship, as <HI>Paul</HI> foretold concern|ing the latter dayes, and we have seen it fulfilled in our times. This was the con|dition and state of the Church of <HI>Israel</HI> in the time when this Psalm was compo|sed, and many others; I will not reprove thee for thy burnt offerings, <HI>I will take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Bullock out of thy Stall. Offering and Sa|crifice</HI> sayes <HI>David</HI> in another Psalm, <HI>thou delightest not in, else would I give it thee,</HI> i. e. comparatively; They were the Sa|crifices of Righteousness, that God most of all delighted in: the other without this, were not of themselves desirable at all. Outward Worship without the concur|rence of inward piety, and holiness, are part of the bodily exercise <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of, <HI>which profits little. Saul</HI> himself seems not to have been wanting in Sacrifices; for he reserved the fattest of them for

that end; but <HI>Samuel</HI> tells him, <HI>that Obe|dience was better than Sacrifice, and to hear|ken than the fat of Rams.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Austin</HI> complained in his time, <HI>that the Church was burdened with the observation of too many Rites, and Ceremonies, and Su|perstitious Observations.</HI> And yet himself Good man (the more was the pity) was not unwilling to increase that burden by superfluous additaments, which with o|ther Bishops, that lived in those times would <HI>assuere</HI> or few unto the ornaments of the Church, what would he and they have said, if they had survived to follow|ing times, when there hath been so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about outward Rites, and Semblance of Holiness, in places, dayes, garments and gestures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> care taken by Christi|ans, to cleanse their hands, and purifie their hearts from the unclean lusts of the Flesh; whereas <HI>Davids</HI> care was to wash his hands in innocency before he compassed Gods Altar. God is a Spirit, and requires such Worshippers, as worship him in spirit and in truth: that take care to wash the in|side as well as the outside of their vessels.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="000362_0037_0FA5557BF5F7D390">
If we consult the History of the Scri|ptures, we shall there find that they were only men that feared God, and walked with him in way of Holy Communion that enjoyed his Salvation: who though they were Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth, yet by the holiness of their lives an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> wayes, approving themselves to God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> those that desired to fear his Names, the alwayes were made to see his Salvation and to dwell under the wings of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ection.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Duties of Righteousness, as well as of Religion, are also a necessary part of a well ordered Conversation. There were two Tables of the Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God, the Duties of Religion were written in the one, the Duties of Righteousness in the other. These two were alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to walk hand in hand, and kiss one another in the Mount of God, like <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron, Joshua</HI> and <HI>Zerubbabel;</HI> the on taking care of the affairs of God, the o|ther of the things of Men. These two were as the Pillars before <HI>Solomon's</HI> Tem|ple; they do not only adorn, but bear up
<PB N="31" REF="000362_0038_0FA5557CB5C45010">
the Foundation of a Peoples Prosperity; if either of these gives way, desolation will soon break in upon a People or Place.</P>
<P>These are the two great Commandments on which hang the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Prophets.</HI> It is in vain to pretend to the one, with|out care &amp; conscience of the other when our Saviour gives a resolution to the young Mans case, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. about the good thing which was to be done in order to eternal life (which was in effect no more than to see Gods Salvation) he is sent to the second Table of the Law, not as if the other were to be neglected, but that he might be convinced how far he fell short in the <HI>Duties of Righteousness toward his fellow-creatures,</HI> and so might the more ea|sily be made to understand what an hard matter it was to fulfil the Duties of the first Table: For as <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>He that loves not his Brother, as he should, whom he hath, and doth daily converse with, how shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e be able to love God as he ought, whom he hath not seen,</HI> 1 Joh. 4. 20.</P>
<P>Hereby is shewed also, that love to our
<PB N="32" REF="000362_0039_0FA5557D795ED038">
neighbour (which includes all acts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Righteousness) is requisite unto life, as well as love to God. This was the Do|ctrine of <HI>Moses's</HI> Law, and of all the <HI>Pro|phets,</HI> whose <HI>Writings</HI> were but <HI>as Com|ments</HI> thereon: <HI>what man is he</HI> saith Da|vid, <HI>that desireth life, and loveth many days that he may see good,</HI> i. e. <HI>Gods Salvation&punc; Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. 34. 12, 13, 14, 15 <HI>and the eyes of the Lord are upon the righ|teous,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>his ears open to their cry.</HI> Men must as well work righteousness as fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, and all they that so do are accepted of God in every nation, <HI>Act.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>The want of the care in either of these&punc; cuts us off from Gods Salvation: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>James</HI> saith, <HI>that mans Religion is in vain who bridleth not his Tongue.</HI> And visiting the Fatherless, or the Widow, is made by him so essential unto true Religion, as if it were the intrinsick part thereof.</P>
<P>True Religion may fitly be compared to a Tree, as such are called <HI>Trees of righteousness;</HI> which look<HI>s</HI> upward, yet take<HI>s</HI> root downward; we look up to God

The particular duties, and rules of this Righteousness towards men are many. They are summed up in a few words by <HI>Moses,</HI> in the Decalogue, or the Com|mandments, and are yet expressed by our Saviour in fewer; <HI>To love our Neigh|bour as our selves:</HI> And that is a sure rule whereby we may be satisfied about the Righteousness of our Actions toward o|thers, by looking into our own hearts, and asking them, if we would be willing, o|thers should do so unto us; which Rule if it were put in practise, would put an end to all, or most of the controversies that Professors, to the scandal of their Religi|on are oft times so eagerly contending about. This is the golden Rule of Chri|stianity, on which we may write <HI>Proba|tum est.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophets under the Old Testament

as well as the Apostles under the new, are found to declaim against impurities, op|pression and deceit amongst men, as well as against impiety toward God; for both arise from the same Principal of corrupt Nature in us all. The Prophet <HI>Isaiah, Chap.</HI> 5. 7. makes a complaint <HI>how the Vine|yard of Gods Church had degenerated from the sincerity of obedience, into wayes of un|righteousness; I looked for Judgment but be|hold oppression, or corruption; for purity and behold a cry.</HI> There is a greater elegancy in the Hebrew words, that can be answer|ed by any of our translations, by the si|militude of the sound in those words.

<P N="5">5. There are other Branches of a well ordered Conversation, very necessary to bring about this Salvation of God. Some|times Prophaneness and Impiety may get such an head in places, that it is not possi|ble to suppress or bear them down with|out an eminent degree of zeal, God was so provoked with the sensual lusts of <HI>Is|rael</HI> at <HI>Baal-peor,</HI> that if it had not been for the zeal of <HI>Phinehas,</HI> that Generation as commendable as they were, had seem but little of the salvation of God: it was his zeal that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ayed the Plague from con|suming the People.

principle of holiness and the fear of God, but he wanted the holy passion of zeal to actuate and exert it. No man had ever more experience of seeing the Salva|tion of God than <HI>David,</HI> and what man did ever declare more zeal against sin, and for the Glory of God, and casting off the works of iniquity; doth he not engage that a vile person shall not tarry in his sight, and him that telleth lies he would cut off: <HI>If such be suffered</HI> saith Solomon, <HI>by the Ruler, all his Servants will be mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead&punc; Then farewel Gods Salvation.</HI> The Church of <HI>Laodicea</HI> lost her dignity for want of zeal; and is severely threatned for this defect: <HI>Be zealous, and repent, or else I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pue thee out of my mouth,</HI> Rev. 4. 16. a cold dull, un-active, luke-warm spirit will in a little time lose the very life of godliness; when in the primitive Church the love of many began to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> cold; it was a pre|sage of their Desolation, which soon after came to pass.</P>
<P>But here we must look to our zeal, that it be not mingled with too much wild|fire; for the wrath of man will never

work the righteousness of God. The Lord Jesus, was, as became the Lamb of God, <HI>meek and lowly of heart;</HI> yet was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> zealous against Hypocrisie, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">niquity.</P>
<P>Tis good to be zealously affected in a good ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er, sayes the Apostle. And so also in a good manner: The Disciples were zealously affected against them that did not follow them; this was not in a good matter: nor was their zeal to be commended that forbad them bringing little Children to the Lord Jesus. And if the Angel that contended with the Devil about the body of <HI>Moses</HI> had brought rai|ling accusations, there had been a defect in the manner. Zeal is an holy affection, and will thrive best in a meek and quiet spirit. No man so meek upon the face of the Earth as <HI>Moses,</HI> and yet no man was found so zealous as <HI>Moses,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">forming the Idolatry of the People, when he set every man against his fellow that was gulty of the fact; and at last grinding the Idol to powder that they might drink it down, that so eagerly had drunk down

The zeal of <HI>Moses</HI> was far more acceptable to God than that of <HI>Jonah,</HI> or <HI>Jehu.</HI> It is not the hot, fiery, curst tempers in a place, that will main|tain and keep up the purity of Religion, and good order, so well as that which proceeds from men of sedate, composed, even tempers, who are alwayes the same for their love to piety and holiness, and hatred of all sin.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the next place, Constancy and Perseverance may be added here: It is not enough to begin well, unless we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on, unless we would fall under the Apo|stles censure of the <HI>Gallathians, Ye did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well once, who hindred you?</HI> he that turns aside out of the way, or sits down dis|couraged, will no more obtain the desired end, than he that never entred thereinto. Therefore Christ tells us, <HI>He that endures to the end, only shall be saved.</HI> Many a Mans obedience is by <HI>fits</HI> and <HI>girds,</HI> as they are urged, and put on by the force of external motives, whereas those that act from an inward Principle are ever the same. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells the <HI>Corin|thians,</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="000362_0049_0FA5558970CB60F8">
that such as his Letters were when he was absent, such shall his deeds be when he is present, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 11. So should a Christian be, the same at last, which he was at first. <HI>The Righteous</HI> saith Job&punc; <HI>shall hold on his way, and he that hath strong hands shall grow stronger and stronger,</HI> Job 17. 9. Who ever entreth into the way of Gods Precepts with a sincere mind, must engage with <HI>David,</HI> to continue in the same to the end: and such who do not so do, will appear to be, <GAP DESC="foreign">, self|condemned. For if it were not in their judgment and conscience the right way, why did they never walk therein? and if it were really so, why did they turn aside therefrom! And as to Gods Salvation, there will no sort of men in the conclusi|on be found further therefrom, than such as are guilty of backsliding from the way of Obedience. The back-slider in heart is threatned to be filled with his own wayes. One saith well, <HI>There are none so bad as they that have been good, and are not, or may be good, and will not.</HI></P>

universality of Obedience; his Con|versation cannot be ordered aright, that lives in the omission of any of the known duties of Religion or righteousness: <HI>David</HI> accounted it matter of shame to be found not to have respect to any of Gods Com|mandments. How can two be said to walk together that are not agreed upon all the points of love and obedience, wherein they are concerned. As God was not liable to be taxed for breach of Covenant in any the least particular of his promises, so doth he threaten to make the <HI>Israelites</HI> know to their cost their insinua|tion of the contrary; <HI>yea, shall know my breach of Covenant,</HI> Psal. 78.

The perfections of the Almighty oblige him to shew his salvation to all them that or|der their way aright, and only to them that so do. His eyes run to and fro through the whole Earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect before him: then 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16. 9. his omnipotent arm is stretched out to save and deliver all such: <HI>walk before me, and be upright, I am God al|sufficient,</HI> saith <HI>God to Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17. 1. And as his hand is able to save them, so is his ear, as well as his eye open to their cry, <HI>Ps.</HI> 34. 15 yea, sometimes before they call God is rea|dy to answer, and whiles they are yet speaking he will hear, <HI>Isai.</HI> 65. 24. to the like purpose is that promise, <HI>Isai.</HI> 58. 9, 10. His word and faithfulness is engaged also, to save all the meek of the Earth: they whose hearts are lifted up in them, are not right before him, but humble, contrite
<PB N="57" REF="000362_0064_0FA5559DDCFC3250">
ones, are the people he is engaged to save and defend: yea he hath bound him|self by his promise, in the 15 verse of this fiftieth Psalm, <HI>that if they call upon him in the day of trouble, he will answer them</HI> The face of the Lord is set against all them that do evil. He is an holy God, and therefore hath declared, that the evil shall not dwell with him: he hates the work|ers of Iniquity, and all them that turn a|side to their own crooked wayes: and his Justice is armed against them with ven|geance to punish them. Not one <HI>iota</HI> of his threatnings shall pass away till all be fulfilled sooner or later upon all the wicked of the World, whose wayes are perverse before him. Yea, he hath de|clared concerning all such, that when they spread forth their hands he will hide his eyes, and when they make many prayers he will not hear, because their hearts and hands are defiled with the guilt of sin.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. From the consideration of his People, who when they order their way aright, are in a meet capacity for mercy, and fit for salvation. In case of a peoples
<PB N="58" REF="000362_0065_0FA5559E83829328">
continued obedience, they may plead Gods Covenant, that they are his People, he is obliged to be their God, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be their Saviour, and to do all that a God can do for them; and in case they have sinned, and done never so perversely be|fore him, yet if they order their way a|right, as to Repentance and Reformation, his Covenant doth then also oblige him to cause them to see his Salvation: this is expresly mentioned by <HI>Solomon</HI> at the De|dication of the Temple, when there was a solemn restipulation, or renewing of Covenant between God and his People, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6. when God appeared unto <HI>So|lomon,</HI> as is expressed in the 14<HI>th</HI> verse of the next Chapter; he seems to assent to all those Articles; <HI>If my People, who are called by my Name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear from Heaven and forgive their sin, and will heal their Land,</HI> in respect of all those Calami|ties insisted on at large in the former cha|pter, and briefly summed up in the former verse. They shall be made to see the sal|vation
<PB N="59" REF="000362_0066_0FA5559F302656F8">
of God delivering them from all those evils, or what ever else might be conceived to befal them. It may be said of such an holy, or such an humbled Peo|ple, that they are a people prepared for the Lord; ready for the salvation of the Lord, and it shall not be long before they see it. Salvation shall be for Gates and Bulwarks to such a People: so was it un|to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and the people in his time; who had sought the Lord, and did by Faith rely upon him; <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is now walled about with Salvation: the proud <HI>Assyrian</HI> shall not be able to shoot an Ar|row over such Bulwarks, much less shall he be able to break through those Gates of Salvation.</P>
<P>This is an experience confirmed of old to the Faith of a believing People, ever since <HI>Jacob'</HI>s time: no doubt he had been humbled for his deceiving his Father, and was reconciled to God, before he took his journey into <HI>Padan-aram,</HI> and therefore now he can plead the Covenant of God, and put the Almighty in mind of his pro|mise; <HI>Thou saidst thou wilt bless me;</HI> there|fore
<PB N="60" REF="000362_0067_0FA5559FF08D9890">
<HI>Jacob</HI> shall be made to see Gods Sal|vation, in the midst of those dangers he is surrounded with. Thus if his People stir up themselves to lay hold of his strength, they shall see the salvation of God in their utmost perils.</P>
<P>God did afterwards make the way of his Precepts plain before his Servants in the Book of <HI>Deuteronomie;</HI> instructing them how they should walk before him in the enjoying, and improving that good Land they were going to possess; how they should till and dress it, how they should reap it, and dispose of the fruits thereof; if they could then say, when they came with their Oblations, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 13, 14, 15. <HI>I have brought away the hallow|ed things out of my house,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I have not transgressed thy Commandments, neither have I forgotten them,</HI> &amp;c. Then might they also add what is in the 15<HI>th</HI> verse, <HI>Look down from thy holy Habitation, from Heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the Land which thou hast given us, as thou swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">est to our Fathers:</HI> Thus having or|dered their way aright, they might with
<PB N="61" REF="000362_0068_0FA555A0CEABE7B8">
confidence and comfort, expect to see the Salvation of God. When a People so walk, as that they can approve themselves to God himself, as <HI>Abraham, I know</HI> A|braham, <HI>that he will not only himself keep the way of the Lord, but command his hou|shold after him to keep the same;</HI> It may then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expected that God will bring up|on them the good which he hath spoken.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. From the consideration of o|thers in the World. If such a People that order their wayes aright in their dai|ly walking with God, or that so frame their doings as to turn unto the Lord their God, if at any time they should humble themselves before him, and yet should not see the salvation of God, what would the wicked and ungodly of the World say, but that it is in vain to serve God? And what advantage is there in circum|cision, and keeping the whole Law of God? if they are like to be plagued as o|ther men; it will be in vain to alter their course and live otherwayes than former|ly they did.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="000362_0069_0FA555A1741F3748">
This were certainly to sin against the ge|neration of the just, in the midst of whom God is alwayes wont to be found. God will therefore have it known in the world, that there is great recompence of reward in keeping the Law of the Lord, and that though the righteous scarcely are saved, yet saved they shall be, whatever become of others. Let <HI>Balak</HI> and <HI>Balaam</HI> con|spire together to enchant the Tents of <HI>Israel,</HI> and lay stumbling blocks before their Feet, yet some shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">nd in the midst of them, so to order their wayes, as that they shall be able to save the rest. They may else plead with God as <HI>Joshuah</HI> once did in such an exigent, when <HI>Israel</HI> did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the salvation of God in a Military expedition, <HI>And what wilt thou do for thy great Name?</HI> Josh 7. 9. But <HI>Joshuah</HI> is bid|den not to be discouraged; let God alone to look after the glory of his own, if his People do but look after themselves, and order their way aright, God will make all the rest of the Nations to behold the glory of his Salvation: God is able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">xalt the valleys and make the rough

places plain; The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all Flesh shall see it to|gether.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But notwithstanding all these great and glorious things that are spoken of the City of God; there lies this great stumbling block in the way of natural men, that they never can get over; yea, which the Saints themselves are oft times at a great set be|fore they can see through it: they observe that though those who are called the people of God, order their wayes never so right; yet they see the salvation of God no more than other men. They bear them complain with</HI> Asaph, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. <HI>Though they cleansed their hearts, and washed their hands, yet all is in vain, they are yet plagued like other men all the day long, and chastened every morning. And with the Church in</HI> Psal. 44. We are counted but as sheep for the slaughter, yet is not our heart turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for thy sake are we filled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> Those that take up <HI>Asaphs</HI> obje|ction, should take along <HI>Asaphs</HI> and the Churches answer, <HI>Asaph</HI> acknowledges it

was his folly and ignorance so to speak: Nevertheless I am continually with thee, <HI>thou hast holden me by my right hand, thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.</HI> It is the end of a matter that is the ground of a right judg|ment thereof. <HI>Finis coro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at opus. Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> ordered his way aright; yet was harrow|ed with much affliction&punc; so may the Church and People of God, but it is only to pre|pare the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oyle for the receiving the seed of everlasting joy and comfort. The People of God are never nearer Salvation than when they are exercised with the greatest sufferings, &amp; so to the eye of sense seem furthest from it; so it was with <HI>Is|rael</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> they never were more grie|vously oppressed, nor served with more rigor, than a little before their deliverance. In like manner the sufferings of the Church under Antichrist, when they come to the greatest extremity, in the three dayes and an half, that <HI>strages,</HI> or slaugh|ter immediately precedes their exaltation into Heaven, and that in the fight of their Enemies. So immediately after the three
<PB N="65" REF="000362_0072_0FA555A530AD3650">
dayes Pestilence in <HI>Davids</HI> time, the Lord, sends out an Inhibition to the Angel that destroyed the People. For now <HI>David</HI> and the people are sufficiently humbled, therefore God is willing to be reconciled, &amp; accept them into terms of favour again&punc; and doth also then signally discover the place he had chosen for his Name to reside in. It may certainly be said unto every humbled, penitent, believing person, as Christ said to his Disciples, they shall see the Kingdom of God, and obtain his sal|vation; and if they do not live to see a temporal salvation in this world, they shall be sure not to miss of eternal salvation at the last. Now let every one chuse what he would have, to be saved from the wrath that is to come, that shall destroy the world of the ungodly at last, or to be sa|ved from trouble and danger here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perish eternally at last. But the full an|swer to all objections of this nature, is, that according to Gods ordinary providen|tial dispensations, God is with his People&punc; while they are with him; which is a truth confirmed by the experience of all ages&punc;
<PB N="66" REF="000362_0073_0FA555A5F00C5E88">
and all People: for some have observed that the long continued success, and pros|perity of their heathen Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> was a reward of their justice, temperance, and industry. So was it in the dayes of <HI>David, Solomon,</HI> and other good Kings of <HI>Judah.</HI> But if God should see cause for a time, out of his infinite wisdom and sove|raignty, to change the hands of provi|dence, and lay the left hand of favour and prosperity upon the younger &amp; less deserv|ing, he is a soveraign Ruler and may do what he will with his own; he may afflict his people in this life, and prosper the wicked for a time, for ends best known to himself; yet all this while, he is near unto his people in all they call upon him for, to uphold and preserve them in, and carry them through all their sufferings, and make them see his eternal salvation at last. None of these things, <HI>sc.</HI> out|ward tribulations, and crosses moved the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> so he might finish his course with joy. They needed not much trouble themselves whatever become of their bo|dies, if they can say with respect to their
<PB N="67" REF="000362_0074_0FA555A925466390">
souls, as a <HI>Monk</HI> said, stroking his paunch, <HI>Modo hic sit bene.</HI> Or what were a man the better if he could gain the whole world, and miss of the salvation of his soul at last. If the body be lost, destroyed by the elements, returned to its first principles, or reduced into the minutest Atomes, yet all shall be gathered together again&punc; and raised up in a state of greater Glory and beauty, than ever it was laid down in; 'Twas observed that the spirit of Glory rested upon the primitive Mar|tyrs, and Confessors, so as there enemies were not able to behold the refulgence of them. 'Twas said of <HI>Stephen,</HI> that they were not able to resist the wisdom, and spirit, by which he spake; and that as he saw heaven opened, the Glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, so they saw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. This might be said to be extraordinary. But <HI>Paul</HI> speaking of all Believers, declares how they are able to triumph over sin and death, and boldly challenge the victory from them all: <HI>Oh death&punc; where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sting, Oh grave

Yet such is the victo|ry of faith, whereby Believers are enabled not only to get the victory, but even to triumph over all their enemies: therefore doth it necessarily follow, that through faith, which is the substance of things hop|ed for, and the evidence of things not seen, they may be able to see the sight of Gods salvation, even then when they pass through the dark vally of the shadow of death. The Lord Jesus was never seen more glorious on earth, than in that apparrel which was dyed red, and stained with the blood of his enemies, when he speaks in righteousness, mighty to save. In like manner the followers of Jesus are also glorious in their apparrel, when they are thus clothed with the gar|ments of Salvation, and assuredly be|lieve, that which ere long they shall cer|tainly enjoy.</P>

the times of their greatest prosperity, are ne|ver so far secured from trouble, but that they may need salvation.</HI> All Believers are, or may be assured of spiritual salvation; they may certainly conclude, they shall at the last receive the end of their faith the sal|vation of their souls: but they may often stand in need of temporal salvation. <HI>David</HI> had as great prosperity in his reign, as e|ver any King on earth before him, for tis said the Lord preserved him whithersoe|ver he went: whence he was too ready to take up this conclusion, <HI>that he should never be moved:</HI> That now all his forraign enemies, as well as intestine foes being subdued, <HI>his mountain stood so strong that it could never be shaken;</HI> But he soon found no small trouble to arise by the hiding of Gods face, <HI>Psal.</HI> 30. 7, 8. <HI>For though affliction cometh not forth of the dust, as</HI> Job <HI>speaks, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground, yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward:</HI> i. e.

Weeds grow out of the ground without mens labour or care; but mens sins are the meritorious cause deserving, and procuring, and Gods wisdom and soveraignty are the efficient and inflictive cause of them, we bring our selves into troubles, but it is God only that can save us out of them. God hath the heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of all men in his hand, and turns them as the Rivers of water: He can turn them to favour, or hate his People as he sees cause.

it self. The Prophet therefore calleth the <HI>Assiyrian</HI> the Rod of God's anger, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his indignation in their hand; but when God hath accomplished his work upon mount <HI>Sion,</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for the humbling of his People, and pulling down their pride, he will then punish the fruit of the stout heart of the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> and the glory of his high looks: He will then call them to account for their proud words, and blasphemous speeches. God leads his People through various changes and difficult paths, sometimes they are made to pass through the water, some|times through the fire; they are in dan|ger of being destroyed by either, without some special kind of Salvation stretched forth. In the dayes of <HI>Amos,</HI> God called somtimes to contend by fire, that devour|ed the great deep, and eat up a part, as he speaks, and somtimes by famine, all which bring <HI>Jacob</HI> low, that he is scarce able to arise. At another season God suf|fers the multitude of this nation to gather themselves together against his People, for the tryal of their faith and exercise of

their grace then the punishing of their sins, as in <HI>Asa's</HI> and <HI>Jehosophat'</HI>s time, or rather that there might be a fit occasion to cut off the wicked nations of the world; but yet they threaten sorely the Church and People of God, that they might learn to put their confidence in him, <HI>who is the rock of their Salvation.</HI> There was one season in <HI>Solomon's</HI> time, when <HI>Israel</HI> was without adversar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> or evil occurrent: <HI>Solomon</HI> was at that time called of God to attend the building of the Temple, and while he was intent upon that work, God was pleased to secure him from all out|ward troubles; but after that time, God stirred him up many adversaries round a|bout, that he was never able to suppress; &amp; though he might forget that calamity coming upon his family&punc; he was neverable by all his wisdom, to save himself and them from, or in the least prevent. So as notwith|standing God may have made a Covenant with his People ordered in all things and sure, as to their eternal salvation, yet there may be cause for God to visit them with temporal calamities and evils which they

After the return from the captivity, when it might have been thought, that they had received double for their sin, and that therefore now their warefare should be accomplished, and that now from that time foreward, nothing but the oyl of comfort should be poured into their wounds; yet you will find their suffrings were not quite ended: many clouds of threatning evil did continually arise, which much darkned their hopes of a set|led time of tranquility. A messenger that came from <HI>Judah</HI> informs <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> that the remnant of the captivity who were left then in the province were in great affliction and reproach, which made him sit down and weep, and mourn ma|ny dayes: that in all that long tract of time, from <HI>Cyrus</HI> his dayes, to that time

There is no new thing under the sun, saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> that which hath already been done, and at present is, the like will be put in practice, while there is a devil in hell to tempt, and wicked men in the world to disquiet, and disturb the building of God's Church upon earth.

<P N="3">3. <HI>God hath promised to be the Salvation of his People.</HI> There is a ground for Faith to work upon.

Faith is the substance of things hoped for: It gives Subsistence, &amp; Being to the things that are hoped for: such as walk before God in a right way, may conclude he is faith|ful who hath promised, who also will do it.

They were of an holy and serious frame of spirit: all their deportment in their civil converse and behaviour, as well as in the acts of Religious worship, fa|voured of a spirit of Piety and the fear of the Lord. Holiness was written upon all their Habitations, and instruments of their callings; that which was said of <HI>Tyre</HI> might in its measure have been truly affirmed of <HI>New-England That her Mer|chandize was holiness to the Lord:</HI> whate|ver their imployments were as to the oc|casion of the World, yet their conversa|tion might have been said to be in heaven.</P>
<P>They were careful not only to avoid
<PB N="101" REF="000362_0110_0FA555D4805F7968">
gross and scandalous sins, but even the very appearances of evil. Such is the o|dious and filthy nature of sin, that Christi|ans cannot keep at too great a distance therefrom, so as to hate the very garment spotted with the Flesh. Our Rulers like <HI>Nehemiah</HI> would not take that liberty which is usual with men of that capacity in other places, because of the fear of God&punc; The Priests or Ministers of the Sanctuary were also cloathed with Salva|tion. There was no compliance with the World, in the vain customs, and foolish fashions thereof, least they might seem to fall short of the promised rest. They la|boured rather to be transformed by the reniewing of their minds, than conform|ed to the World. Sobriety, Tempe|rance, and Moderation were the guize of those times: Civil imployments were so ordered and managed, as not to hinder the higher designs of Faith and Holiness, and promoting the glory of God. They rested not in outward forms, and modes of Worship and Religion, without the life and power thereof. If there be still, the like awfulness and circumspection in the

<P><HI>Use of Exhortation:</HI></P>
<P>If any design to see the Salvation of God, here is the most compendious way leading thereunto, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> To order our Conversation aright: what is required thereunto hath been described before; which all may be reduced to these three heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. To set God at our right hand, and then we shall never be moved by any temptation or tribulation. Set up his Glory as the end we aim at in all our de|signes: Gods Salvation will certainly fall into all those that will sincerely aim at his glory in all they undertake; both as to their imployments, and injoyments. <HI>He is the life,</HI> sayes Moses, <HI>and thy length of thy dayes;</HI> who gave us our lives at

first, and lengthens out our dayes, which we should therefore direct all unto his glory as to our last end and chiefest good. <HI>Whether we eat or drink, do all</HI> sayes Paul, <HI>to the glory of God.</HI> It is the property of all rational Agents, to act for some end; otherwise we act but like bruit creatures, that are led by a kind of sensitive instinct as things and objects are casually present|ed to their senses or fancies: Now those who are guided by a principle of Reason, can aim at no lower end, than God him|self, who is the Author of our being, and proposed that to himself, when he formed us, <HI>that we should be unto his praise.</HI> He is the <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> the first and the last Rom. 11. 36. <HI>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Make use of all the means which are requisite to the attaining this end which can be no other, than what God himself hath propounded. <HI>Non per ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itur ad deum, nisi per deum.</HI></P>

So it is said <HI>Prudentia est oculus cujuscumque virtutis.</HI> The eye that directs the hand to act, and the foot to walk in the path of virtue, or in the way that is right.

Now there are many in|gredients necessary to the composition of a wise man, or one that in the Text is called a <HI>Prudent man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The first Ingredient, is <HI>Sagacity,</HI> or a spirit of discerning, and quickness of understanding, that makes a man to be fore-sighted to look into the pene|tralia of a case or difficulty; to see afar off; to discern events in their causes, and consequents in their antecedents, as <HI>So|lomon</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="000362_0147_0FA5560413266F70">
saith, Prov.22. 3. <HI>The wise man fore|seeth an evil, and hideth himself;</HI> when he that is dull and weak sighted, passes on and is punished. The Lord commended the unjust Steward because he had done wisely, he is not commended for using of deceit and falshood, but for his Wis|dom, in foreseeing the danger of being put out of a Stewardship, and having no where to betake himself in a time of distress; so it is said, the wise mans eyes are in his head, as in the watch Tower to look round about, and discern what may be approaching afar off. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Lord is the beginning or princi|pal part of this Wisdom; as tis said of <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Servants, upon the threatning of the Hail, <HI>He that feared the Lord made his Servants, and his Cattle flee into the House before hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. David's</HI> wisdome traces <HI>Joab</HI> in all the Woman of <HI>Tekoaes</HI> wiles. There is in some persons an oracular kind of wisdom, that they can discern the most secret kind of things, and find out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> difficulties, whereby they can dis|cover the true nature and state of the most hidden things.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="000362_0148_0FA5560477B7C370">
<HI>Solomon</HI> finds the way to pass a right Judgment in a very difficult case; by the secret affection of the natural Mo|ther to her own child; whence the peo|ple observed the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment: this was by a na|tural sagacity, whereby he was able to judg of things by their causes and ef|fects. In like manner did <HI>Solomon</HI> judg of <HI>Ado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ijah's</HI> hidden Rebellion, by his tampering about <HI>Abishag</HI> as an overt act that discovered a secret intent in his heart to turn about the Kingdom to himself by his intimation, that the King|dom of right did belong to him. So did he by a like depth of wisdom, pass such a prudent Sentence upon <HI>Shimei,</HI> which though good and favourable in it self, yet was so warily circumstanced that it became a Trap to take an old Sinner in, and bring upon him the pun|ishment justly due, without breaking <HI>David's</HI> word.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another part of wisdom is to pitch upon the right manner, after the
<PB N="139" REF="000362_0149_0FA55605333F79F0">
end is discovered; many a man fails in the compassing or bringing about the great and main design of his own hap|piness and security for lack of this wis|dom: He that foreseeth the evils if he doth not betake himself to a right shel|ter, may be overtaken therewith, though he hath foreseen it: When <HI>Israel</HI> saw his wound he sent to King <HI>Jareb;</HI> so did <HI>Ahaz,</HI> but that did not heal or help them, but plunged them further into the depth of their misery. Suppose we have rightly judged of the end, be it an evil to be avoided, that may be like to ruin us; or a good to be desired to make us happy; if we take an indirect course, for the one or the other, we may get a curse instead of a blessing or run into a greater mischief than that which we intended to avoid: He that makes use of lawful means, as one sayes, to bring about an unlawful end, doth as it were put God into the Devils service, as he that does evil, that good may come thereon, puts the Devil into Gods service
<PB N="140" REF="000362_0150_0FA55606205A4D88">
both which are abominable. True wis|dom brings all circumstances into con|sideration, which are to be weighed in the ballance; and what means, with all circumstances considered is the most proper to accomplish the end propoun|ded is only to be made use of. When the Iron is blunt, wisdom must be had to direct, whether more sharpness in the Instrument, or more strength in the A|gent be best to be improved: wisdome must teach men when to answer a Fool according to his folly, and when not. There is a time to speak, and a time to keep silence; wisdome must determine by circumstances, when the the time of the one, or the other is. <HI>Non minus est magna virtus scire desiner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> quam scire di|cere;</HI> Nature teaches all men to do the one, it is wisdome that teaches some men the other. <HI>Hushai</HI> befooled all <HI>Absolom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Counsellors, and under God was the means of defeating <HI>Achitophel'</HI>s peri|lous Counsel, by propounding the un|seasonableness of the time; which was
<PB N="141" REF="000362_0151_0FA55608E1BDE4C8">
the very hinge on which hung the weight of the whole business which none of the rest discerned but <HI>Achito|phel.</HI> Thus a wise mans heart discerns both time and judgment as well the time when, as the matter, what is to be done. If <HI>Rehoboam</HI> could have served the people but that one time, they would in reason have served him for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is a wise man that is cautious to redeem the time, as well as to discern it. The Apostle tells us, <HI>they do not walk circumspectly, as wise but as fools that do not redeem the time.</HI> Time, which is one of the preciousest Talents in our hands can never be recalled when once it is past. <HI>Post est occasio calva.</HI> This is the precipice of Destruction where thou|sands are shipwreckt because they do not improve their season, but act as if they had time lying on their hands, which is the quickest commodity in the Market of Eternity, for it passes away swifter than a Weavers Shuttle, or the

Eagle through the air.</P>
<P N="4">4. Diligence also denominates a man to be wise; without that no design or enterprize of moment can ever be carri|ed on. Diligence is a qualification to which many promises are made; and experience declares it to be a principal part of wisdom: <HI>Therefore</HI> sayes Solo|mon, <HI>he that is diligent in his business, he shall stand before Princes, who use to carry on designs of the greatest moment:</HI> This preferr'd <HI>Jeroboam</HI> first to the charge of the house of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and afterwards to be over all the rest of the Tribes. As on the other hand, he that is slothful in business is brother to a great waster; Through the slothfulness of the hands the house will drop through, and so be ruined, as well as if it were pulled down by the hands of foolishness. The vineyard of the slothful is over-run with Thistles and Thorns (which with dili|gence might have abounded with plea|sant fruits) so is the heart of the sloth|ful Professor with lusts of the Flesh.</P>

5. The prudent man is no changling: He that orders his affairs with discretion, doth not dance up and down like a meteor in the Air, <HI>but his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord:</HI> Those men of old called <HI>Homines quadrati,</HI> that are always steady, resting on their Basis, and not turning and rowling from one side to an other; not like quick-silver, running every way, but fixed no where.

<P>T<HI>He Excellency of the work of making, or maintaining peace may be gathered from the great reward promised by our Saviour to all such, that they shall be called the Children of God: And although it be a Duty principal|ly incumbent on the Counsellers and Em|bassaders of peace, yet such is the necessity thereof oft times, even in the best times of the Church that may encourage any one, and discourage none that may have an opportu|nity of dealing therein. It is recorded of old, that not only</HI> Bezaleel and Aholiab <HI>attended to the work of the Tabernacle, who were immediately inspired, and called of God to that service, but that all who were wise in heart willingly offered themselves thereunto: on which considerations, it need be the less wondred at, that the Worthy

Holy</HI> David <HI>him|self that was a Man of War, and expert in that Service, famous for his skill, and suc|cess therein, makes this Declaration for him|self;</HI> That he was for Peace, though o|thers when he spake, were for War. <HI>And indeed they were commanded of God to offer terms of Peace to the worst of their Enemies (all save the</HI> Cananites <HI>that were under the</HI> Anathema) <HI>before they enter|prized a War upon them.

The Differences between the parties abovesaid at least as they are scattered in the breasts of individual men (for it will be hard to find a company agreeing in the same) are in general about the external Order and Regiment in the Church, and Administrations therein, a|greeing not only in all Doctrinal Points, but in the same manner of Administra|tions in all the Essentials of Order; The particular differences may be referred to two Heads, (1.)

<P>The Distemper that is dangerous to an Athletick, is mortal to a decayed body; are not gray hairs upon us? are we not past our Meridian? is not our Sun past the Tropick? and are not all motions the swifter the nearer they are to their period? the Physitians tell us that old age is a sickness, and are not we <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confecti?</HI> are not decayes upon us? have we not lost our best blood and spi|rits? where are our <HI>Winthrop, Dudley, Cotton, Hooker's, cum multis aliis,</HI> the <HI>Shamgars</HI> that singly could have made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> against a whole Host; and good <HI>Wilson,</HI> whose Faith and charity would have been a Soveraign <HI>Alexipharmacon</HI> in our contagious distempers.</P>
