But if a vicious Mind hears the Vice re|proved, and forms pleasing Ideas of the Crime, without tak|ing Notice of the just Reproof, the Fault is in the Depravity of the Mind, not in the needful and just Reprover.&mdash;This is a very remarkable Curiosity, abounding with entertaining Sto|ries and conclusive Reajonings,</HI></CELL>
