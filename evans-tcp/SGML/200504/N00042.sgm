</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe <HI>Sparrow</HI> being now gone, and one dayes respite from publick Labours on the Lords-day falling to me in course, I have sought out your Writing, and have re|viewed it, and finde (as I formerly expressed to your self) that the Quest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on is mis-stated by you; and that the Arguments which you produce to prove that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is not de|nied, are (in reference to this Question) spent in vain, as arrows are when they fall wide of the Marks they should hit, though they strike in a White which the Archer is not called to shoot at.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000079_0003_0F9F8F86D403B3F8">The terms wherein you state the Question, are these:

<P N="2">2. Nor have the Churches countenance of State in all Coun|treys, but are under Restraint and Persecution in some; as the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Aegypt</HI> under <HI>Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oh,</HI> and in the Captivity in <HI>Babyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> and the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> 300 years after Christ persecuted by <HI>Ro|man Emperours:</HI> and in these dayes those Reformed Churches <HI>sub <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruce</HI> in <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and other Popish Countreys.</P>
<P N="3">3. In some Countreys the Churches are indeed under the Pro|tection of Magist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ates, as Forreigners&punc; permitted quietly to sit down under their Wings: but neither are the Members capable of Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stracy there, nor have they power of Voting in the choice of Magistrates: Such was that Church of Strangers gathered in <HI>Lon|don</HI> by <HI>Johannes Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> with allowance of State under the Broad Seal of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Edw.</HI> 6.

<P N="2">2. The second thing that I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">slike in your stating the Question, is, in that you make the <HI>Churches of Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st to be the subject of this R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ht and Power of choosing Civil Magistrates.</HI> For 1. The Church so considered is a Spiritual Political Body, consisting of divers Mem|bers Male and Female, Bond and Free; sundry of which are not capable of Magistracy, not of Voting in the choice of Magistrates, inasmuch as none have that Right and Power but free Burgesses, among whom Women and Servants are not reckoned, though they may be, and are Church-members. 2. The Members of the Churches of Christ are considerable under a twofold respect an|swerable to the twofold man, which is in all the Members of the Church whilst they are in this world, <HI>the inward &amp; the outward man.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4.16.</NOTE> Whereunto the onely wise God hath fitted and appointed two sorts of Administrations, <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Civil.</HI> Hence they are ca|pable of a twofold Relation, and of Action and Power sutable to them both; <HI>viz. Civil</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and accordingly must b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ex|ercised about both in their seasons, without confounding those two different states, or destroying either of them, whilest what they transact in civil Affairs, is done by virtue of their civil Relation, their Church-state onely fitting them to do it according to God.</P>
<P>Now that the state of the Question may appear, I think it sea|sonable and necessary to premise a few Distinctions, to prevent all mistakes, if it may be.</P>
<P>First then, let us distinguish between the two Administrations or <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="distinction"> Pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties, <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Civil,</HI> which men commonly call <HI>the Church,</HI> and <HI>Common-wealth.</HI> I incline rather to them who speak|ing of a <HI>Christian Communion,</HI> make the Communion to be the

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4"><PB N="7" REF="000079_0006_0F9F8F8910CC8598">4. Though they both agree in this, that they have <HI>the same last End.</HI> viz. <HI>The Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f God,</HI> yet they differ in their next Ends; for the next End of Civil Order and Administrations, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>The Preservation of Humane S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cieties in outward Honour, Justice and Peace:</HI> But the next Ends of Church Order and Administrations, are <HI>The Conver|sion, Edification, and Salvation of Souls, Pardon of Sin, Power against Sin, Peace with God.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence ariseth another Difference about the <HI>Objects</HI> of these different States: for though both agree in this, that they have the <HI>common Welfa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> for their aime and scope; yet the things about wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the Civil Power is primarily conversant, are <HI>Bodies,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.4. or <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the things of this life,</HI> as <HI>Goods&punc; Lands, Honour, the Liberties and Peace of the outward man.</HI> The things whereabout the Church Power is exercised, are <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5.1.</NOTE> <HI>The things of God,</HI> as <HI>the Souls and Consciences of men, the Doctrine and Worship of God, the Communion of the Saints.</HI> Hence also 1. They have different Laws: 2 Different Officers 3. Diffe|rent Power, whereby to reduce men to Order, according to their different Objects and Ends. Now that a just harmony may be kept between these two different Orders and Administrations, two Ex|tremes must be avoided: 1. That they be not confounded&punc; either by giving the Spiritual Power, which is proper to the Church, into the hand of the Civil Magistrate, as <HI>Eras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> would have done in the matter of Excommunication. If any Magistrate should presume to thrust himself by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Authority or otherwise, into a Work which properly belongs to a Church-Officer, let him remember what be|fell <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Vzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> for so doing: or 2. By giving Civil Power to Church-Officers, who are called to attend onely to Spiritual mat|ters and <HI>the things of God,</HI> and therefore may not be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stracted from them by Secular intanglements. I say, Church-Officers, not Church-members; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r they (not being limited as the Officers are by God) are capable of two different imployments, suting with two d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fferent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in them, in different respects, as hath been said: and as they may lawfully be imployed about things of this l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, so they are of all men fittest, being sanctified and dedicated to God to carry on all worldly and civil business to Gods ends, as we shall declare
<PB N="8" REF="000079_0007_0F9F8F89DB2975F0">
in due time. But concerning Church-Officers I am able with Gods help to prove, that the devolving of Civ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Power upon Pastors of Churches, (upon how specious pretences soever it began) gave that Rise to the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> which at last set his feet on the necks of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Princes of the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h, yea, of the Empe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours of the World. It was your mistake, when you too confidently affirmed, That <HI>the limiting of the Right and Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of choosing Civil O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ficers unto free Bur|gesses that are Members of Churches, brought that Tyranny into the Romish Church, which all the Churches of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rist complain of.</HI> It would well have become you to have better digested your own thoughts, before such words had passed through your lips; for you will never be able to produce any good Author that will confirm what you say. The truth is quite contrary; for that I may instance in <HI>Rome</HI> it self: Had Churches been rightly managed&punc; when the most considerable part in that City embraced the Christian Faith, in the ceasing of the <HI>Ten Persecutions,</HI> that onely such as had been fit for the State, had been admitted into Church-f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llowship, that they alone had had power, out of themselves to have chosen Ma|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">strates, such Magistrates would not have been chos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, as would have given their Power to the Pope; not would those Churches have suffered their Pastors to become Worldly Princes and Rulers, as the Pope and his Cardinals are; nor would they have given up the Power of the Church from the Church into the Officers hands, but would have called upon them to <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lfill their Ministry which they had r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceived of the Lord</HI>; and if need were, would by the power of Christ have compelled them so to do: And then where had the Popes Supremacy been, which is made up of the Spoils of the Ecclesiastical and Civil State? but had by the course which now we plead for, been prevented.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Extreme to be avoided, is, That these two dif|ferent Orders and States, <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> and <HI>Civil,</HI> be not set in op|position as contraries, that one should destroy the other, but as co|ordinate States in the same place reaching forth help mutually each to other, for the welfare of both, according to God: So that both Officers and Members of Churches be subject, in respect of the outward man, to the Civil Power of those who bear Rule in the Civil State according to God, and teach others so to do: And that
<PB N="9" REF="000079_0008_0F9F8F8A9B157CA8">
the Civil Magistrates and Officers, in regard of the inward man&punc; subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct themselves Spiritually to the power of Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st in Church-Ordinances, and by their Civil Power preserve the same in out|ward Peace and Purity; and this will best be attained, when the Pastor may say to the Magistrate, as <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> wrote to the Magistrate of <HI>Nazianzum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rem mei gregis esse sacri greges sacram <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em:</HI> I know thou art a sheep of my Flock, a holy sheep of a holy-Flock.

And when the Civil Magistrate in his Church-state, answereth <HI>Ambrose</HI> his description of a good Emperour: <HI>Ipse Imperator bonus intra Ecclesiam, non su|pra Ecclesiam est.</HI> A good Magistrate is within the Church, not above it. Lastly, when according to <HI>Junius</HI> his description of the Power of the Christian Magistrate in Church-matters, be accounts it his duty to embrace in Fellowship with the whole Church, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut verum Christi &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> memorum</HI> the Laws given by God in the Church, and the means sanctified by him to nourish the inward man, and to protect and defend the same: [<HI>Tanquam Magistratus a Deo Ordina|tus</HI>] for, saith he, <HI>As he is a Christian,</HI> he is <HI>sancta oris de sancto Christi grege, (i. e.</HI> A holy sheep of Christ's holy flock.

So much shall serve to have been spoken concerning the first Di|stinction.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Distinction</HI> to be premised for clearing the true state <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="distinction"> of the Question, is, [<HI>Inter Remp. constitutam &amp; constituendan</HI>] Be|tween a Common-wealth already setled, and a Common-wealth yet to be setled, and wherein men are free to chuse what Form they shall judge best. For I conceive, when <HI>Paul</HI> exhorted the <HI>Romans</HI> to <HI>be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ject to the higher Powers,</HI> who at that time were Heathen men, and Persecutors, he considered that Civil State as setled, and suted his Advice accordingly. But if he had been to Direct them about laying the Foundation of a Christian Common-wealth, he

to make use of them about some service to be done about his Church.

<P>The Assumption (<HI>That the Form of Government described in the true stating of the Question, doth give unto Christ his due preheminence</HI>) will easily be granted by those that shall consider what Civil Magi|strates and Rulers in the Common wealth those are, who are fittest to serve to Christ's ends for the good and welfare of his Church; which will be evident from two places of Scripture: First, in Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2.10, 11, 12 you have a description of those that are fitted to order Civil Affairs in their Magistracy to Christ's ends; they are such as are not onely wise and learned in matters of Religion but also do reduce their knowledge into practise: they <HI>Worship the Lord in fear</HI>; and not only so, but <HI>Kiss the Son,</HI> which was a solemn &amp; outward <HI>Pro|fession of love</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.14.</NOTE>, and <HI>of Subjection</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg">Gen. 41.40. 1 Sam 10.1.</NOTE>, and <HI>of Religious Worship</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg">Hos. 13.2.</NOTE>, and so fitly serveth to express their joyning themselves to the Church of Christ.

grew up together? Oh blessed people, among whom each Administration shall conspire with one mouth, and one minde, to conjoyn and advance the Communion of Saints with the Civil Society!

<P>The fourth Argument shall be taken out of 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 6. <HI>ver.</HI> 1, <HI>to</HI> 8.<MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="argument"> Whence I thus argue: <HI>That Form of Government wherein the power of Civil Administrations is denied unto unbelievers, and committed to the Saints, is the best Form of Government in a Christian Common-wealth, and which men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat are free to chuse (as in new Plantations they are) ought to establ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh. The Form of Government described in the true stating of the Question, is that wherein the power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Civil Administrations is de|nied to unbelievers, and committed to the Saints. Therefore the Form of Government described in the true stating of the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">estion, is the best Form of Government in a Christian Commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, and which men that are free to chuse (as in new Plantations they are) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught to est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blish.</HI> The Pro|position is evident from the Scripture alledged. For, the thing which <HI>Paul</HI> blameth in them, is not, that living under unbelieving Magi|strates, they submitted to their Civil Judicature when they were cited to appear before their Judgement-seats: but this be reproveth, that when they were free to chuse other Judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, (as in voluntary re|ferences they were) they would out of ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice be judged under the unjust, and not under Saints. His Arguments against this are many and weighty. 1. From the danger of thus exalting unbelievers,
<PB N="20" REF="000079_0019_0F9F8F9C95DEE468">
and abasing the Saints, in these words, <HI>Dare any of you having a mat|ter against another, be judged under the unjust, and not under the Saints?</HI> 2. From the quality of unbelieving Judges whom he calleth <HI>unjust,</HI> because they are destitute of the righteousness that is by Faith, and which is the Fountain of all true Moral Justice: and because they were ill-affected to Christians, and to the Church of Christ, and apt to vex them injuriously, if they had any business before them; and because though some men out of Christ may be found civilly honest, and morally just, as were also some Heathen men, yet you can have no assurance of their justice, seeing this is the genius and nature of all men out of Christ to be unrighteous. 3. From the property of Church-members, whom he calls <HI>Saints,</HI> that is, men consecrated to God and to his ends in all things; for so they are in their Church-estate, and by virtue of their Covenant are bound so to be: when as others are (or at least are not manifested to be otherwise according to Gods order) worldly-minded, or self-seekers, <HI>minding their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ.</HI> The 4^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">^h Argument is <HI>a majo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> for he saith <HI>The Saints shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> judge the world,</HI> and blames their igno|rance that question it: <HI>Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the world?</HI> and thence inferreth, that they should much more have judge|ment <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>in matters that concern this life</HI>&punc; such are Humane Contracts, mens Goods&punc; and Lives, and outward Liberties. The 5^t Argument is from the Wisdom wherewith the Church of God is furnished for all Civil businesses: <HI>Is there not a wise man among you?</HI> as if he should say, It cannot be that more wisdome should be for transacting of businesses according to God in men that are out of the Church, then in those that are in the Church? howsoever much worldly wisdome is sometimes given to men of the world, yet not sufficient to reach Gods ends that is the Priviledge of Saints, they onely are <HI>wise as Serpent,</HI> the other men may be as <HI>subtile as Foxes.</HI> And seeing it is by Christ that <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs reign, and Princes decree justice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 8.15.</NOTE> how can it be supposed that Christ, who is the Head of the Church, will furnish others with a Spirit of Wisdome and Govern|ment in Civil Matters, and deny it to the Church, Members of his own Body, whom he alone sanctifieth to his end?</P>
<P>The Assumption <HI>(That the Form of Government in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Common-wealth which we plead for, is that wherei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the power of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vil Admini|strations

<P>I Answer, The fear of God, and Faith of those men,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> may be justly doubted, whose setled abode is in a place where Churches are gather'd and order'd according to Christ&punc; and yet are not after a conveni|ent time joyned to them: For if in those times and places where the Name of Christ was a Reproach, men were no sooner converted, then they were <HI>added to the Church,</HI> and their being added to the Church, was made an evidence of their conversion; what may we think of those men who living in times and places where the Or|dinances of the Gospel may be enjoyed in purity, with peace in Church-fellowship, do yet live without the Church? 2. Though there be sundry degrees of distance from the Church, to be found among men that are out of Church f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llowship, as the Heathen are further off then moral Christians, yet the same Spirit of unrighteous|ness and enmity against Christ, worketh and bears rule in an uncon|verted Christian, as doth in an unbaptized Heathen: He is unsancti|fied as the other is, and so unsutable to Gods ends in civil Admini|strations; and therefore it will not be safe, nor according to the Rule, that where a Church is gathered according to Christ, the Members should be neglected, and such men intrusted with mana|ging the Publick Affairs&punc; as are not in fellowship with them.</P>
<P>The fifth Argument may be taken from the Nature and Power <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="argument"> of Church-Order, which when it is managed according to Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st's appointment, affordeth best security to a Christian State, for the faithful discharge of any Trust that shall be committed to those that are under it. Whence I thus argue: <HI>That Form of Government where|in the power of chusing from among themselves, men to be intrusted with

managing all publick Affairs of Importance, is committed to them who are furnished with the best helps for securing to a Christian State the faith|full discharge of such a Trust, is the best Form of Government in a Chri|stian Common-wealth, and which men that are free to chuse (as in new Plantations they are) ought to establish.

<P>The Assumption <HI>(That the Form of Government which we plead for, is that wherein the power of chusing men to be intrusted with ma|naging of all publick Affairs of Importance, is committed to them who are furnished with the best helps for securing to a Christian State the faithful discharge of such a Trust)</HI> may be confirmed, by shewing what these Helps are; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. That the Members of the Church are <HI>Saints by calling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 1.2. John 15.19. Heb. 12.23. James 1.18. Isai. 11.1, 2. Luke 1.75. Psal. 50.5. Deut. 26.17, 18.</NOTE> i. e. men <HI>separated from the world, and the pollutions thereof,</HI> out of which <HI>they are called, and dedicated to God</HI>; as the <HI>first-born,</HI> and the <HI>first-fruits</HI> were; and they are qualified, by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he spirit of wisdome and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fear of the Lord,</HI> in some measure through fel|lowship with Christ, to serve God and men <HI>in holiness and righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eous|ness all the dayes of their lives.</HI> 2. That these <HI>Saints by calling</HI> being in Church-Order according to Christ's appointment, are in Cove|nant with God, and one with another whereby they are most strict|ly bound to do faithfully, whatsoever they do to God or men. 3. That by virtue of this Order, they are bound to mutual helpful|ness, in Watching over one another, Instructing, Admonishing, and Exhorting one another to prevent sin, or to recover such as are faln, or to encourage one another, and strengthen them in well-doing.</P>
<P>Thus are they bound in a threefold Cable unto all Faithfulness <HI>in all things to God and Man.</HI> The like assurance cannot be had in any other way, if this course be neglected.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="argument"> The sixth Argument, with which I will conclude, that I may not weary you with Reading, as I have wearied my self with W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng) shall be taken from <HI>The Danger of devolving this Power upon those that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not in Church-Order.</HI> From whence the Apostle would

Adde hereunto, The Danger of corrupting Church Order, either by compelling them to receive into fellowship unsutable ones, or by imposing upon them Ordinances of men&punc; and worldly Rudiments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 2.22, 23.</NOTE> or by establish|ing Idolatrous Worship; or by strengthning Hereticks in subvert|ing the common Faith, as those <HI>Arrian Emperours,</HI> and Ido<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atrous Kings and States have done, of which we reade so many instances.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Danger to be feared in reference to the Civil State, is, 1. The raising of Factions to the disturbance of Publick Peace, whil'st some Magistrates out of the Church, watch their seasons to strengthen themselves against those that are in the Church, till they have wrought them out of Office and Power in the Civil State: and in the mean time, what other can be expected from such unequal mixture in State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 2.42, 43.</NOTE> but that they should be as <HI>the toes of the feet</HI> of <HI>Ne|buchadnezzar</HI>'s <HI>image,</HI> which <HI>were part of iron, and part of clay,</HI> they should be partly broken, and partly strong, and not comfortably joyn one with another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay. The second Danger to the Civil State, will be, A perverting of <HI>Justice</HI> by Magistrates of worldly spirits, through Bribery, respect of persons, unacquaintance with the Law of God, and injuriousness to the ser|vants of God. But I must break off, lest I grow too tedious. How easily might I adde the Consent of all Nations to this Truth in some proportion, who generally practise accordingly? In our Native Countrey, none are intrusted with managing of Publick Affairs, but <HI>Members of the Church of England,</HI> (as they call them.) In <HI>Holland,</HI> when the <HI>Arminian</HI> Party had many Burgomasters on their side, <HI>Grave Maurice</HI> came into divers of their Cities with Troops of Souldiers, by Order from the <HI>States Generall,</HI> and put those <HI>Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|nian</HI> Magistrates out of Office, and caused them to chuse onely
<PB N="24" REF="000079_0023_0F9F8F9F99B0D010">
such as were of the <HI>Dutch Churches.</HI> And in <HI>Rotendam</HI> (and I think it is so in other Towns) the <HI>Vrents<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ap</HI> (who are all of them of the <HI>Dutch Church,</HI> and free Burgers) do out of their own company chuse the Burgomaster, and other Magistrates and Officers. In all Popish Countreys and Plantations, they observe it strictly, to in|trust none with the managing of Publick Civil Affairs&punc; but such as are <HI>Catholic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> (as they speak) and of the <HI>Roman Church.</HI> Yea, in <HI>Turkey</HI> it self, they are careful that none but a man devoted to <HI>Ma|homet</HI> bear publick Office. Yea, these very <HI>Indians</HI> that Worship the Devil, will not be under the Government of any <HI>Sagamores,</HI> but such as joyn with them in Observance of their <HI>Pawawes</HI> and <HI>Idolatries</HI>: That it seems to be a Principle imprinted in the mindes and hearts of all men in the equity of it, <HI>That such a Form of Go|vernment as best serveth to Establish their Religion, should by the con|sent of all be Established in the Civil State.</HI></P>
<P>Other things I might adde, but I hope enough hath been said for Defence and Confirmation of what I have affirmed touching this matter. If you remain unsatisfied, I shall desire that you will pla|cidly, and lovingly, and impartially weigh the Grounds of my judgement, and communicate yours if any remain against it, in writing. For though much writing be wearisome unto me, yet I finde it the safer way for me Now the God of Peace and Truth lead us into all wayes of Peace and Truth, to the Praise of his Grace through <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who is <HI>the Way, the Truth, and the Life. To whom be in all things the Preheminence, and Glory, and Praise.</HI> Amen.</P>
