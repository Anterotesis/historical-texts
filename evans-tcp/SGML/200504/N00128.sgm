<P>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the evil dayes come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BE pleased to understand, That the Text that I have now read un|to you, is not of mine own choosing, but was chosen by him (a little before he left us) who is now in another World. It was his earnest desire about two or three dayes before his death (being apprehensive that his <HI>change</HI> was at hand) that I would Preach a Sermon for him upon this Text: His surviving Friend and Companion, who held him very dear, and with whom he left it to prosecute this his desire, hath been unsatisfiedly urgent with me in this behalf, That the earnest desire of the <HI>dying,</HI> and the will of the <HI>dead</HI> as to this matter might be fulfilled; which seconded by others, hath drawn me to this, which it may be I have been too loth to attend. I would not reluct or deny, when mans will and desire carrieth with it any signification or intimation of the will of God, or shun any occasion or opportunity of doing any the least good which his Providence is commending to me, and such I dare not say but this is. You may look upon this Sermon then as the <HI>Request of the Deceased,</HI> as <HI>The Legacy which this Young man hath left by his last Will to the Rising Generation.</HI> Me-thinks it seems to me, that our business with this Text at this time (mine and yours) is from the becknings of <HI>Divine Providence</HI> thereunto directing: for not onely the desire of the deceased (calling us as it were with his last breath to the consideration of this Subject) but <HI>his Death,</HI> nor his alone, but that of <HI>others,</HI> lately taken away (both among our selves, and in Neighbour-Plantations) whose

<P>THis whole Book is in the substance of it a serious calling men back unto God, a recalling men that are forget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng God, <HI>forsaking their own mercies, and following after lying vanities,</HI> from those vain, emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tless pursua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces, to the remembrance of him. The sum of this whole Discourse (wherein G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat and Wise and Experienced <HI>Solomon</HI> is giving us in his own account, that we may know what to trust to) stand upon these two Points.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Chief Good of the sons of men is not to be found in all Crea|tures under the Sun, nor in mens labours and travails about them</HI>; all the good that by the greatest industry can be gotten out of them, being but <HI>vanity&punc; and vexation of spirit,</HI> as he after a thorow tedious search had found by woful experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That mans Happiness is to be found onely in God, and in the being unto Him.</HI> This is that great Conclusion that he is laying down as the sum and issue of all, in the 13<HI>th</HI> Verse of this 12<HI>th</HI> Chapter; <HI>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his Commandments&punc; for this is the whole of man.</HI> Upon these grounds we have him throughout this Discourse, as cautioning men against Creature-pursuances, and seek|ing happiness where it is not to be had, and nothing can be extracted by the most skilful Chymistry but <HI>vanity and vexation of spirit</HI>; so, calling them to the Creator, and the remembrance of him, in whom, and wherein, their Happiness doth indeed consist.</P>
<P>Amongst many other Arguments, Motiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Perswasions, which we have used all along in this Book, to disswade men from an over-mindful|ness of, thoughtfulness about, and eager seeking happiness in the Crea|ture, the Wise-man drawing towards a conclusion, is urging home this great Argument, taken from the brevity of life, the certainty of ap|proaching death, and the solemn and momentous Consequences attend|ing and following upon it. We have him sometimes touching upon it before, but more fully falling in with it at the 7<HI>th</HI> Verse of the 11<HI>th</HI> Cha|pter, and prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing it to the 8<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> Verse of this 12<HI>th</HI> Chapter.

<P>The first Inference or Duty exhorted to in the last Verse of the former Chapter is, <HI>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh:</HI> so I do, may the young man think, while I rejoyce in my youth, and my heart chears me, while I walk in the wayes of my hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and in the sight of mine eyes; if this be not to remove sorrow from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">art, and put away evil from my flesh, what is?

<PB N="6" REF="000183_0005_0FA3156506C8CD18">
that puts not away the evil of sin from his flesh, cannot long put away the evil of smart and suffering: whatever vain sensual men may imagine, the winding up will prove that of the Wise-man true, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.29. <HI>As righteousness tendeth to life, so he that pursueth evil, pursueth it to his own death</HI>: and the Reason backing it is bottomed upon the same main Argu|ment, the <HI>flittingness, brevity,</HI> and <HI>uncertainty of Life,</HI> even in the young and lusty; <HI>for Childhood and Youth is vanity,</HI> i. e. are fading, passing, un|certain, soon spent&middot; Young men may bear and behave themselves as if imagining their hot blood, lusty bodies, activity, beauty, would last al|wayes, and their youthful pleasures never be at an end; but, <HI>Childhood and Youth are vanity:</HI> Death may not wait till they be gray-headed; or however, the earliest Morning hastens apace to Noon, and then to Night.</P>
<P>The second Inference or Duty exhorted to, you have in the words of the Text, <HI>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</HI> As in the former he was calling off from sin, vanity, the empty pursuance of the Crea|ture, so in this he is calling to, and putting upon the remembrance of the Creator, <HI>q. d.</HI> relinquish your vanities, and your sensual pleasures and contentments, which will be bitterness in the latter end, and set your hearts seriously God-ward, turn your thoughts toward the minding him. And this Exhortation of young men to the <HI>now remembring of their Crea|tor,</HI> is urged upon them by the same main Argument still, The flittingness and vanity of Life, and the approaching certainty, and the evil and dark dayes of old Age and Death, <HI>While the evil dayes come not,</HI> &amp;c. as in this and the following Verses; <HI>q. d.</HI> old Age and Death are hastening upon you, and will certainly and soon overtake you. It is the former part of the Verse, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth,</HI> that I shall insist upon, taking no further notice of the latter, but as it may be an Argument to enforce this. And here because I study expedition, and the <HI>Explication</HI> will necessarily take up some room and time, as also that the <HI>Reason</HI> of the duty here required of us, is couched in the expressions wherein it is commended to us, We shall first lay down the <HI>Conclusion</HI> or <HI>Point of Doctrine</HI> from the words, and then open it to you, and fetch the Reasons out of its own bowels. The <HI>Observation</HI> then (according to the terms of the <HI>Text,</HI> which we shall after more fully unfold) is this:
<Q><HI>Doct.</HI> That it is every mans Duty, every young mans Duty, now in the dayes of his youth, to Remember his Creator. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</Q></P>
<P>It is every mans duty to <HI>remember God,</HI> it is every young mans duty
<PB N="7" REF="000183_0006_0FA31565CDCC6CC8">
to do it <HI>now</HI> in the dayes of his youth. For the clearing up of the Do|ctrine, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king way for the Application and Improvement of it, we have three things to handle and unfold: (1.) What this <HI>Remembring our Creator</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he duty which the Text and Doctrine calls for) is importing. (2) The Reasons of our <HI>so doing,</HI> which the term of <HI>Creator</HI> is imply|ing. (3.) Why the Younger may not put it off, but it must be <HI>now done, now in the dayes of their youth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. What this <HI>remembring God, remembring our Creator</HI> is importing. <HI>Remembring,</HI> commonly in Scripture acceptation, is not strictly taken for the simple act of memory, the meer retaining a thing in our heads, nor is so here to be taken for any one simple act of the Soul, nor yet divers and continued acts of one and the same Faculty; but it is taken for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. It is the common saying of Divines, That words of knowledge of sense in Scripture, imply affection and action, cogitation and practice, take in both the head and heart, include the whole Soul: by one word of <HI>know|ing, remembring,</HI> and the like, is included the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. Such is the combination and concatenation of all the Faculties of the Soul, as of Links in a Chain, that draw one and draw all, break one and break all; upon this account any one act, or the act of any one single Faculty, as <HI>knowing, remem|bring,</HI> &amp;c. is usually in Scripture put for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul. The term of <HI>our remembring God,</HI> so of <HI>his remembring us,</HI> is used ordinarily not strictly, but in such a latitude as we have been speaking, if you consult <HI>Neh</HI> 4.14. <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.34. <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.42. <HI>Luke</HI> 23.42. and a number of Texts more that might be named and recited (but I fear to be tedious) you will finde the sense of the phrase to run according to the breadth which we have been saying. In a word, we then <HI>remember God,</HI> not when we barely think of him, but when as such we affectio|nately and practically acknowledge him, when we really own, and bear our selves toward him as our Creator; in sum, when the whole entire motion of the whole Soul is Godward.</P>
<P>Thus briefly and in general. But because the burthen of the Duty of the Text hangs upon this word <HI>Remember,</HI> we shall yet a little further unfold it, and shew you yet somewhat more fully, distinctly, and particu|larly, what the <HI>remembring God</HI> is implying and inferring, briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Remembring God,</HI> is implying and inferring <HI>converting, turning unto God,</HI> Psal. 22.27. <HI>All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord:</HI> All men naturally are forgetting God, and turning from him, and men then <HI>remember God,</HI> when they convert and turn unto him: men na|turally

Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God&mdash;lest when thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built good|ly houses, and dwelt therein; and when thy herds and thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied, then thine heart be lifted, and thou forget the Lord thy God &mdash; and thou say in thine heart, My power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth: But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</HI> So <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> God is in like manner cautioning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them <HI>thankfully to remember him,</HI> and to take heed of self-ascribing: See <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.34. <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.35. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21. not thankfully to acknowledge and ascribe unto God, is to forget him, not to remember him; <HI>remembring him,</HI> implies thankful acknowledgement of, and ascribing to him. To <HI>Remember God,</HI> is then to convert and turn unto him, Know and own him, To set him up, delight, rest in, and trust and depend upon him, To serve and obey him, Thankfully to acknowledge and ascribe unto him. This, and whatsoever else of knowledge, acknowledgement, esteem, homage, love, delight, trust, dependance, service, obedience, thankfulness, and ascribing, is due from the Creature to the Creator, is implied and wrapt up in this, <HI>Remember thy Creator:</HI> We may say of this, as the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.8, 9. <HI>He that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law: for this, Thou shalt not commit Adultery, Thou shalt not Kill, Thou shalt not Steal, Thou shalt not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> false Witness, Thou shalt not Covet: and if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying&punc; namely, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self:</HI> So, He that remembers God fulfils the Law, dischargeth the duty of a Creature to his Creator: for this, Thou
<PB N="10" REF="000183_0009_0FA3156804408BF8">
shalt know him, Thou shalt own him, Thou shalt love him, Thou shalt trust in him, Thou shalt serve him, Thou shalt ascribe unto him: or if there be any other Commandment, if there be ought else that is matter of duty from man to his Maker, it is briefly comprehended in this saying&punc; namely, <HI>Remember thy Creator.</HI> Now of the things which we have spo|ken, this is the sum; That to remember God, is really, heartily, affe|ctionately, practically to own and agnize God for God, and to honour and glorifie him as God; and this is to be indeed godly, to be really re|ligious, Religion being nothing else but a Doctrine of remembring God, knowing and owning God. But so much what this <HI>Remembring God</HI> is importing.</P>
<P N="2">II. The second thing to be spoken to is, the <HI>Reasons</HI> and <HI>Grounds</HI> of our so doing, which the very term of <HI>Creator</HI> is implying. It is not un|usual in Scripture for men bespeaking God in Prayer and Thanksgiving, to present God under such sutable Notions, such Titles and Attributes, as may most fitly set him forth as the Author and Bestower of the desired or obtained good, as you may see <HI>Gen.</HI> 43.14. <HI>Jer.</HI> 14.8. <HI>Psal.</HI> 28.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 144.1, 2. so God speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng to us, and requiring duty from us, is clothed with such Considerations, presented under such Notions and Titles as may carry with them the ground and reason of, and motive to the duty called for, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 8 13, 14. <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.22. and elswhere. So here, there is Reason, Ground, Motive enough, in the Notion and Title of <HI>our Crea|tor</HI> that God is set forth by, to put us upon the duty required, the re|membring of him: <HI>O come</HI> (say they, <HI>Psal.</HI> 95 6.) <HI>let us worship and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> And this is their Motive, <HI>Psal.</HI> 100.1, 2, 3. <HI>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands: serve the Lord with gladness, and come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our selves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. At that day</HI> (saith the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 17.7) <HI>a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</HI> To whom should the Creature have a respect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul eye, whiche should he look, but to his Maker? whom should man re|member, but his Creator? But that we may more fully see this, we must know, that the term of <HI>Creator</HI> here used, sets forth God as the Author of our Being out of nothing, so of all our Being and well being, our bringing into Being, our continuance in Being, our preserva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, our well-being; all the administrations of God about us as to this, are wrapped up in his being set forth as our Creator; nor onely so, but con|sequently, the Right that he hath in us, the Regiment and Dominion that he hath over us, and the Disposure that he hath of us, are here in|cluded.
<PB N="11" REF="000183_0010_0FA31568C48F1D40">
These things considered, <HI>Why we should Remember our Creator,</HI> is most evident, and the Reason runneth very strong. But to touch some things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because God being our Creator, the Author and Fountain of our Being, is the End of our Being: the <HI>first Cause</HI> must needs be the <HI>last End</HI>; he that made all of himself, made all for himself, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16 4. <HI>The Lord made all things for himself</HI>: Rom. 11.36. <HI>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things</HI>: Of whom, and through whom are all things, to him are all things; he that primarily made all things of him|self, made all things ultimately for himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because God is not onely bringing us into, but continuing us in Being, preserving, and administring to our well-being: we must all of us bespeak God in <HI>Job</HI>'s language, <HI>Job.</HI> 10.12. <HI>Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit,</HI> i. e. Being and well-being, and continuation of both: He is styled, <HI>The preserver of men,</HI> Job 7.20. <HI>He holdeth our soul in life,</HI> Psal. 66.9. <HI>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</HI> Acts 17.18. He maintaineth, and bloweth up the spark of his own kindling; <HI>He giveth to us life, and breath, and all things, ver.</HI> 25. of the same Chapter: It is from his careful Providence, that is continually exercised about us, that such frail needy creatures are sup|ported and supplied, having a subsistence, and a comfortable one. God is not like the Carpenter or Mason, that buildeth the House, and then leaveth it to it self, or the care of others, but he keepeth up what he set|teth up: we should quickly lose all, and sink into our nothing again, did not the same hand that brought us out of nothing, keep us where we are. And to whom then do we owe our service? whose are we? whom should we remember? to whom should we be&punc; but his, to him, from whom we have our maintenance and preservation, who is not our Maker onely, but our continual Upholder, and most bountiful Benefacto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">?</P>
<P N="3">3. Because God being our Creator, is our Proprietor, Possessor, Owner, Lord, Governour. As the Lord builds the house, and keepeth it in repair, so he holdeth it himself; as he built it for himself, so he con|tinueth to be the Proprietor&punc; Owner, Lord, Governour, Possessor of it; as he putteth not man out of his own hands in respect of preservation, so neither in respect of possession and dominion, <HI>Isa.</HI> 43.1. <HI>But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and that formed thee, O Israel &mdash; thou art mine.</HI> To whom God saith, <HI>I have created, I have formed thee,</HI> he saith also, <HI>Thou art mine</HI> It is most probable indeed that the Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> here speaks rather of spiritual then natural formation, of Gods making them in Grace then in Nature, but the reason holdeth the same and alike

good in both; God is said to possess us upon a Creating account&punc; his forming is phrased his possessing of us, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.13. <HI>Thou hast possessed my reins, thou hast covered me in my Mothers womb,</HI> so he possesseth us upon a Creation account: as he possesseth us in making, so he possesseth us having made us. God then challengeth us, and layeth claim to us in the most <HI>Absolute Right,</HI> for it is beyond us to imagine, nor indeed can there be a more full and undoubted Right and Title, then Creation giveth; he being our Creator then, is in the most unquestionable Right our Pos|sessor, Proprietor, Lord, Owner, Disposer, and we are his possession, for his use, at his dispose, bound thereunto in the highest and most un|questionable Right&mdash; More might be added, from the <HI>knowledge</HI> God hath of us, as being our Maker, and intimately acquainted with us; <HI>He that made man, knoweth what is in man</HI>; he that <HI>formed the heart</HI> soundeth it, <HI>John</HI> 2.25. <HI>Psal.</HI> 33.15. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Acts</HI> 15.18. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.1, and the following Verses: and from the <HI>power</HI> that he hath over us, being easily able to reach us, and punish us at pleasure, for all our forgetfulness of him, and neglects of duty towards himself, the same hand that made can break us, he that built can easily pull us down, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 5 7. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b</HI> 10 8. <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.29, 30. but I may not further amplifie these things.

<P N="3">III. The third and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ast thing to be spoken to&punc; for the clearing up of the Doctrine is, <HI>Why the youngest may not put it off&punc; but they are now to re|member their Creator, now in the dayes of their youth.</HI> We shall fetch the Reasons of this also out of the Text it self, and they are (but to name them as it were)</P>
<P N="1">1. Because young men now in the dayes of their youth&punc; owe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Creator this present debt of remembrance; this debt of duty and acknow|ledgement, is due from man to his Maker, as (and as soon as) years of discretion render him capable of it: This debt doth not come to be due in Sickness, at Death, or in old Age, but it groweth upon us with our capacity, from our very Cradles, it is from first to last Gods due, and our duty according to our capability, it is as well our duty that we remem|ber him in our youth, as in our age, it is as well his due, that we remem|ber him <HI>now</HI> as hereafter, every man is deeply obliged (as you may see from the grounds before given) to remember his Creator, and young men will find, if they examine them, that those reasons lye as hard upon them as the gray-headed&punc; <HI>Is God the God of the Jews only?</HI> saith the Apo|stle, <HI>is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</HI> Is God the Creator, Preserver, Proprietor of the old man onely? is he not also of
<PB N="13" REF="000183_0012_0FA3156A46EBA310">
the young man? yes, of the young man also. Every man is indis|pensibly, presently bound, it is the young mans <HI>now duty,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is Gods <HI>now due.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because as it is young mens <HI>now duty,</HI> Gods <HI>now due,</HI> that they re|member him, so God calleth for it <HI>now,</HI> it is Gods due from young men that they remember him <HI>now in the dayes of their youth,</HI> and God gives not day for payment, he requireth it out of hand of the Youngest. Look through the Scriptures and you will finde (I may not stay to instance in particular) all the commands of God respecting turning from sin and vanity, and the neglect of him, and turning to, remembring and acknow|ledging of him, to lye upon you in the <HI>present tense,</HI> as what is to be now, instantly, presently, and without delay attended.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it is young mens <HI>now duty,</HI> Gods <HI>now due,</HI> that they remember him, and God now calleth for his due, so now is the fittest time of pay|ment. It is Gods <HI>now due,</HI> and God requireth it <HI>now,</HI> and such may best do it, and discharge it <HI>now,</HI> in the dayes of youth&punc; there is no such season as this <HI>now,</HI> these dayes of youth are affording; this reason you have ex|pressed in the text, and prosecuted in the following verses, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the evil dayes come not, nor the years draw nigh, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them,</HI> &amp;c. I do but meerly touch these things here, because as time will g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve leave, we shall have occasion to improve them further in the Applica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctrine, which we now come to. And the Uses we shall make of it are onely these two, (1.) For Conviction and Reprehension. (2) For Exhortation.</P>
<P><HI>Vse</HI> I. is <HI>for Conviction</HI> and <HI>Reprehension</HI> of mens forgetting God, mens forgetfulness of God. Is it <HI>every mans duty, every young mans duty</HI> (as you have heard) <HI>now in the dayes of his youth to remember his Creator?</HI> How is it God is so forgotten as he is? Men forget him in their youth, and remember him not in their Age; of young and old it may be com|plained as of <HI>Israel,</HI> Hos. 8.14. <HI>Israel hath forgotten his Maker.</HI> The charge, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 23.35. <HI>Thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behinde thy back,</HI> may be sadly applied to persons of every esta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and condition.

O sad world! how do men having the world, live without God in the world? live on Earth, as if there were no God in Heaven, either in regard of any need they have of him, or duty that they owe him. O how much is God forgotten in the world! how little is he remembred amongst men! and that man should not remember, but forget his Maker, what strange impiety, what provoking sin is it! One would think that whatsoever men forget, or were unmindful about, it should be rather of any thing, rather of every thing, then his <HI>Creator,</HI> the God that made him, the God that is (as you have heard) the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of his Being, that is his Upholder, Pre|server, and gracious visitant every moment; that is his Proprietor, Owner, Possessor, Lord, Governour, that challengeth him in the most Absolute and unquestionable Right; that is throughly acquainted with him, and as throughly able to reach and punish him for all his neglects of duty towards himself: yet alas, what doth many a man less remem|ber, more forget then his Maker? <HI>At that day</HI> (saith the Prophet in the place before-mentioned, <HI>Isa.</HI> 17.7) <HI>shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the holy One of Israel:</HI> but at this day the contra|ry in sad experience is to be seen, and said of most men, They look not to their Maker, and their eyes have no respect to the holy One of <HI>Israel.</HI> Oh how little God-ward, their Maker-ward, do most men look? how little respect have they for him? they have enough, and more then e|nough for the Creature, but they have little or none for the Creator.

<P N="1">I. Our first work then is, to set before you this sin in <HI>the Evidence of it,</HI> to shew you <HI>what this sin is,</HI> thereby endeavouring to convince men of it (what, how fearful a sin it is for man to forget his Maker, for the creature not to remember his Creator, we have next to shew you) The present enquiry is, <HI>Whether you are not guilty?

<P>First; <HI>As to the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter of it.</HI> Forgetfulness of God is threefold:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A forgetting that there is a God</HI>; not that the being of God is wholly rased out of the mindes of men, and utterly lost as to any rememb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance of him, but a mindlesness, thoughtlesness of him, as we are said to for|get that which we do not think of, that which we do not minde, and they may well be said to forget God that minde him not, that think not of him, that are not frequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntly think<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Being of a God to themselves: and how many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> thus forgetting God, of whom it may be said as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> 10.4. <HI>God is not in all his thoughts.</HI> There is here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the world, that denies the Being of a God, but there are too many that do not deny, yet

forget that there is a God, that think slightly and seldomely of him. Oh! mens mindes are strangers to the serious thoughts, to the reall and awakened apprehensions that there is a God. And to think of God, of the Being of a God slightly, seldomely, now and then by the <HI>by,</HI> is to forget him. O Sirs, do you not desperately forget your Creator? may you not be called and construed (and that truly) <HI>Forgetters of God,</HI> when the reality, the indeedness, awfulness of his Being, is the least thing thought of or minded? when the Creature swallows all, the Creator hath not one thought of a hundred, a thousand it may be.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A forgetting who, and what manner of God he is.</HI> As they may truly be said to forget God, that remember not that God is, so they that remember not, that forget who and what manner of God he is, this (as well it may) is called and accounted <HI>a forgetting God,</HI> as you may see <HI>Psal.</HI> 50 21, 22 Verses compared; <HI>These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

We shall say something (though we must be brief in either) both of the <HI>greatness,</HI> and of the <HI>danger</HI> of it.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>greatness of the sin of forgetting God,</HI> may appear:</P>
<P N="1">1. From <HI>the deep obligation that lyes upon you to remember him as he is your Creator.</HI> Look back upon what hath been said before, and consider what obligation Gods being your Maker layes upon you to remember him; you are wholly God's in all that you are and have from first to last; you are, and have nothing, but what you are and have from him and for him. To forget, disacknowledge him therefore (being every way as deeply bound as is possible or imaginable) must needs be a great wicked|ness, a transcendent evil. O Sirs, do but seriously consider how much you are indebted unto God for all things, and all along from your first Being untill this now, and sure it will appear a strange, horrible, unrea|sonable, unthankful, vile, inexcusable thing, to forget and disacknowledge h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. O think, I beseech you, how can it but be a sin of the <HI>first Magni|tude</HI> to forget, disown God, who hath not onely done so much upon a <HI>Creation account,</HI> but is doing so much every day upon a <HI>Providential account,</HI> to make himself remembred by you? sure there can be no room to think it a light thing to forget and disacknowledge God, while his daily, hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, visitations, and gracious remembrances of you, have any room in your thoughts: What, forget him <HI>that visits you every morning, and mindes you every moment!</HI> We have the Psalmist in a rapture of holy ad|miration, <HI>Psal.</HI> 8.4. <HI>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</HI> That God should be mindful of man, so remember, visit him, what a wonder is it? That man should be mind|less of God, forget, disown him, what a wonder is it? That God should be thoughtful of and about us, is a wonder of mercy and condescention; that we should be thoughtless and unmindful of God, is a wonder of un|reasonable and unthankfulness, for the friend to forget his friend, any

The bodies that you bear about you, all your bones, all the mercies you receive, all the creatures you enjoy and behold, are your d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y remembrancers of God. O that you would think your lives are filled up with mercies, you are daily laden with benefits, and there is not one blessing which any of you have, but it hath from God this written upon it, <HI>Remember me.</HI> When God puts Bread into thy hands, he saith, <HI>Here, eat and remember me</HI>; when he fills thy Cup, he bids, <HI>Remember me</HI>; when he puts Clothes upon thy back, he saith, <HI>Remember me:</HI> God gives thee all, and he gives thee all to lead thee to himself, the remembrance and acknowledgement of himself. And, O man, is it nothing for all this to forget and disown God, to whom thou art so obliged and indebted? That <HI>God</HI> that hath as it were studied so many wayes to fasten himself in thy remembrance, canst thou make a light matter of it, or how canst thou look upon it otherwise then an intolerable inexcusable evil, to sin against such merci|full multiplied, and obliged remembrances of him? How canst thou but say, <HI>How shall I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</HI> O how wilt thou ever be able to hold up thy head, that God that thus deeply and dearly deserved to be remembred by thee, shall question thee for thy forgetfulness of him? wilt thou then be able thinkest thou, to make as light a matter of it as thou now dost, when he himself shall reason out the case with thee, when he shall say, <HI>Did I indeed make and maintain thee? did I house, and lodge, and feed, and clothe, and deliver thee? did I visit thee every morning, and take care of thee every moment, and all to for|get me?</HI> Sinner, God forgetting sinner, can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong in the day that God shall thus deal with thee? <HI>Now consider this ye that forget God, lest be tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. And lastly Consider, God will finde a time to remember such as forget him, he will finde a time to be remembred (and sadly remembred too) by such as most slight him, God will have his glory, his acknowledge|ment, he will fetch it out of those that forget and disacknowledge him upon earth, in Hell, <HI>Psal.</HI> 61 17. <HI>The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the nations that forget God</HI>; then and there God will be righted, he will come <HI>ever</HI> with thee for all thy neglect, contempt, forgetfulness of him, and casting him behinde thy back, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.4. <HI>The Lord hath made all things for himself; yea even the wicked for the day of evil</HI>; q d.

Oh that I might be thy effectual Remembrancer upon the account! Oh that I might perswade, prevalently perswade thee, <HI>now in the dayes of thy youth to remember thy Creator!</HI> Oh that <HI>now</HI> man, <HI>now in the dayes of thy youth,</HI> while it is yet morning with thee, thou wouldest take time at ad|vantage, and improve this present, precious, peerless season, which will be but for a little while, in the serious applying thy self hereunto, and minding the God, and thy duty towards the God that made thee, <HI>now while the evil dayes come not.</HI> Remember and turn unto him <HI>now,</HI> set up, and acknowledge, and love, and fear, and serve him <HI>now</HI>: Do not think there is no such haste, if any man may put it off for a while I may, there can be no great danger or damage in deferring it a little: There is such haste, no man may put it off, no not a while, neither mayest thou, the danger, the damage of deferring but a little, a week, a day, may be thy eternal undoing.

Questionless that is duty, that it is of necessity, and that it shall be done, they will finde a time for it, is with most men: Sure thou art saying in thy heart (thou that at present art most remiss, negligent and forgetful of God) I will remember and turn unto the Lord sometime or other before I die: thou art intending, purposing&punc; promising thy self, that though at present thou art too neglective, yet it shall not be alwayes thus, hereafter thou wilt be more serious, and if it be done at <HI>any time,</HI> it will be as well as if thou didst it <HI>now.</HI> Hast thou not some such reasonings of heart as these? To which I answer, That though such indeed be the bottomless Mercy of God, and the boundless Merits of the precious Blood-shed of the Lord Jesus, that upon a sound and soaking Repentance, and serious re|membring of him at last, those that have long, ever so long neglected it, shall be graciously forgiven, yet it is not otherwise all one to forget, neglect God this day, week, moneth, year, though thou shouldst remem|ber him the next. Man, it is thy duty <HI>now,</HI> it is Gods due <HI>now,</HI> thou mayest not think it is well enough, or it is all one, if thou remember and turn unto him any time hereafter; the duty of <HI>to day</HI> cannot be done <HI>to morrow,</HI> thy <HI>now duty,</HI> the duty of thy youth, cannot be done hereafter and in thy Age, though the neglect may be repented of and pardoned, which how seldome it is we shall hereafter shew.

Thy delaying, deferring, putting off, doth dispose thee more and more still to delay, defer, put off: the longer thou art putting off, the stronger will thy disposition be to be putting off still; the old Saying is full true here, <HI>Qui non vult hodie cras minus aptus erit,</HI> He that will not to day, shall be less fit to morrow; he that puts off now, will be more prone to put off hereafter; he that defers for the present, will do it much more for the future. Let me ask thee, (and I beseech thee seri|ously consider of it) Dost thou finde thy self more disposed to take the present time that now is, by all thy past puttings off? nay, dost thou not finde that the more thou delayest and puttest off, the more thou mayest, and that thou art so much the readier to do it still, by how much the longer thou hast done it already? and if this be the effect of <HI>former put offs</HI> as to the present, thou mayest easily gather what will be the fruit of <HI>present put offs</HI> as to the future. O believe it, every dayes procrastina|ting, every weeks, and moneths, and years proroguing and putting off, sets thee further off upon this account. Alas man, thou goest on from day to day, from one time to another, feeding thy self with future hopes, promises, purposes and intendments, while every day a greater indispo|sition, dilatory dangerous death threatning temper is growing upon thee. And (2.) Consider, as thy indisposition, disaffection is strengthned by thy delaying, so every day the letts and hindrances, and blocks and diffi|culties in thy way are heightned. Dost thou not think thou wouldest

Thou mayest flatter thy self while thou art putting off <HI>now,</HI> and putting off <HI>then,</HI> with the hopes of a future repentance and conversion, but certainly Satan who is labouring thy ruine, upon a more probable ground promiseth himself his prey, while putting off to deliver thy self, thou art every day more entangled in his snares, and the way of thy repentance blocked up, and rendred more difficult and unlikely every day then other. Do but seriously think of this, and sure thou wilt see little reason to be delaying and putting off any longer; thou wilt see great reason to set thy self to a present <HI>remembring thy Creator,</HI> to a now converting and turning unto God. Did thy delay advantage thee, it were somewhat; did it facilitate thy work, did it wear out the hindrances it were somewhat, nay did it not disadvantage thee it were more tolera|ble; but when such is the evident and apparent disadvantage of delay, O that ever thou shouldst be guilty of this manifest folly, yea madness, as to put it off full. And (3) Consider, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s by delaying and putting off to <HI>remember thy Creator,</HI> thou art increasing thy own indisposition, and the letts and difficulties in thy way are daily heightned; so also (which is as considerable as any thing) thou art set further and further off the efficacy of helps and means hereunto conducing: thy continuing to re|fuse, resist, put off, hath a probable and woful tendency to take off the edge of any Convictions, Admonitions, Perswasions, and make them of no force with thee. What is the reason of (which we see in sad experi|ence to be so) the little efficacy the Ministry of the Word hath upon the hearts of men that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">en long under it, nay the less efficacy then for|merly.

<P N="4">4. And lastly, Consider, <HI>now in the dayes of thy youth</HI> is the best&punc; the choicest, and most advantagious season to <HI>remember thy Creator,</HI> because hereby thou shalt best provide (most abundantly, most surely) for thy own good and comfort, as is notoriously evident. But to instance briefly in three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hereby much sin, and consequently much sorrow, many tears and temptations, many a sad thought will be prevented: thou canst not but know (if thou knowest any thing) that every day thou art deferring and putting off to remember God, every day thou art going on to forget, neglect, disacknowledge him, thou art making work for Repentance, thou art hereby laying up sorrow for thy self, if God shall hereafter give thee Repentance; or if not, <HI>treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of Gods righteous judgement:</HI> Thy present neglect most obviously runs thee upon this <HI>dilemma,</HI> either many sorrows, sad throws of heart, if God peradventure will give thee Repentance here, or eter|nal sorrow in the place of sorrow, where there is nothing but <HI>weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth</HI> hereafter, and who would wittingly make a rod for his own back? who would willingly persevere in a course of laying up sorrow for himself? who would do knowingly, continue to do that, that he must sorrowfully undo, or suffer eternally for? who would thus wilfully make work for Repentance? Believe it man, if ever God give thee sound Repentance, <HI>Repentance unto life,</HI> thou wilt finde sin evil and bitter enough, thou needest not aggravate it&punc; when thou indeed comest to make work for Repentance, thou wilt then know what it is to have made so much work of Repentance, when God shall set thy sins, thy neglects of him, a course of forgetting, slighting, contemning him, that thou hast long run on in, <HI>in order before thee,</HI> though it be in order to thy Humiliation, Repentance, Conversion, it may make thee wish again and again thou hadst never stood out so long, and stored up so much sor|row for thy own soul. Let me here intimate to you a little more particular+ly two or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hree things, I will but intimate them, though well worthy your serious consideration. (1.) As we have been saying, Be sure the more thou multipliest to sin, the longer thou art going on in a course of for|getting God, the more thou art multiplying thy own sorrows if God vouchsafe thee Repentance. (2.) Late Conversions are like Births in those that are ancient, not without much difficulty, a hard travail, many throw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, difficult deliverance&punc; God saveth some, though more seldomly, that have longer put him off, but it is then <HI>so as by fire,</HI> as the Apostle
<PB N="39" REF="000183_0038_0FA3157DC5C21F00">
speaks, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.15. or as it is <HI>Jude ver.</HI> 22.23. <HI>And of some have com|passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, making a difference, and others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with fear, pul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them out of the fire:</HI> so God acts, such a difference he makes, in seasoning some with his grace in their young and tender years, and more easily work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng them to himself, whilest others that run on are saved with fear, and pulled as brands out of the fire; many fears, heart-misgiving, despairing thoughts such are ordinarily attended with, God commonly makes those that long put off, a <HI>Magar-missabib</HI> if ever he shew them mercy: such are more seldome humbled, converted, saved, and when they are, it is not without much ado. (3) The sins of youth, which such have deeply run into, and long run on in, (though God do at last recover them by a sound and soaking Repentance, and save them through much fear and terrour) remain many times a <HI>Corrosive</HI> gnawing upon their Spirits all their dayes, the sting of such and such a sweet sin that they have been deeply in, sticks with them to a dying day; it is made the hypocrites portion, to have <HI>his bones full of the sins of his youth,</HI> Job 20.11. but it is many times the lot of such whom God hath brought home to himself by a sound Repentan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to be <HI>made to possess the iniquities of their youth,</HI> as is evident from <HI>Jobs</HI> complaint, <HI>Job</HI> 13.26. and <HI>Davids</HI> prayer, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25 7. Upon this account, by remembring and turning to God now, thou mayest haply prevent such sins, which should God give thee here|after Repentance, may stick with thee to a dying day, and <HI>bring down</HI> (as <HI>Jacob</HI> speaks) <HI>thy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</HI> See then this ad|vantage in a present early turning unto God, it wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prevent many sor|rows, a great deal of sad work. O therefore take the Wise-mans coun|sel in the last Verse of the foregoing Chapter, <HI>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh,</HI> do not put it upon thy self, but take the course, the onely wise way to remedy and prevent it, which he prescribes in the Text, <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As hereby much sin and sorrow will be prevented, so hereby thou shalt abundantly provide for thy own good, comfort, benefit in after-time: if God take thee sooner hence, it will be well thou art ready; if not, thou wilt abundantly reap in thy Age the benefit and advantage, the good and comfort of thy early remembring and turning to God. <HI>Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th or Spring</HI> (as one saith) <HI>is the Seed-time of grace and godliness:</HI> if in the Spring no Seed be sown, or none but Cockle or Darnel, or such Weeds, what hope of Harvest, or what a Harvest may be expected?

Consider more particularly a few things here&punc; but to touch them. (1.) To remember and turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o God, to be good, take a right course betimes, is the way to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good, to be setled and established in the way of God and godliness in Age; the sooner thou art seasoned with right principles, pious principles in youth, the more deeply and indelibly will they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> into thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Age, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.6&punc; <HI>Train up a childe in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI> The Proverb is, <HI>A young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and an old Devil:</HI> but the Spirit of God knows better, and tells us&punc; <HI>A Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in youth, and an established Saint in Age</HI>; that which is sucked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in youth, and a person is then seasoned with, becomes well rooted and setled in him in Age. As it is a dreadfull thing to grow&punc; Aged in sin, because such are hardly removed: so is it a happy thing to grow Aged in Grace and Godlinesse, because such are most firmly esta|blished: but the onely way to this, is to begin betimes.

<P>I have said what I shall say upon this Text, beseeching you that it may be thought upon, and beseeching God to give his blessing: But I have another Subject, that I must crave a few minutes time, and a grain or two of patience more<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to say something of; and that is <HI>the Young man lately deceased,</HI> at whose <HI>Request,</HI> and as whose <HI>Bequest,</HI> you have had this Sermon; and it is not the <HI>Commendation of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that is the thing in|tended, he needs it not, but the <HI>Instruction of the living.</HI> As his Death in the time and manner of it was a real Sermon upon the Text, of which we have been speaking, so (in other respect) was his Life also in some good degree: and I have two sayings (to young men especially upon this Subject) 1. In some things observable in him as to his Life, he was <HI>a Patern for your Imitation.</HI> 2. In some things observable about him as to his Death, he was <HI>an Example for your Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>First, In some things observable in him as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Life, he was <HI>a Patern for your Imitation</HI>: but to intimate some few things of special remark.</P>
<P N="1">1. He was a young man of an <HI>innocent Conversation,</HI> of a <HI>civil, sober Behaviour</HI>; he was not of a debauched dissolute life, nor did he <HI>run with others to that excess of riot</HI> which (with sad hearts) we see many young men do; his Conversation was not spotted with such marks of deboist|ness, as are too visible upon too many of his Age. Now though Civility, Sobriety, Morality, are not Grace, yet they are <HI>Jewels of price,</HI> that have an amiableness and loveliness both in the eyes of God and good men: it is said of the young man in the Gospel story (in <HI>Mark</HI> 10.21.) that when Christ had heard from him what he had done, how he had lived, that he was a civil, sober, moral man (though evident it is by the story that he was a stranger to <HI>the power of godliness</HI>) that <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us beholding him, loved him.</HI> Not but that <HI>I am perswaded better things of the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of whom we are speaking, <HI>and things that have accompanied salva|tion, though I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us speak:</HI> but to shew you, that a meer Civil, Sober, Moral man is otherwise by God looked upon, then others are
<PB N="43" REF="000183_0042_0FA315810089C1A0">
that are Scandalous and Profane: Christ hath a <HI>comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> even to the better sort of ungodly men, more then to the worst; a civil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sober, outwardly conform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble life, hath its account with God: not that I would have you rest here, I hope his Example led you h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gher.</P>
<P N="2">2. He was a young man of <HI>a serious Spirit,</HI> he had some real weight with him, and worth in him. It is said of him by those of the Family where he formerly sojourned amongst us for some time, and now lately died and took his leave of this world, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>they never heard a vain mis|becoming word come out of his mouth</HI>; and his Conversation was accord|ing&punc; he was not vainly given, nor spent his time in Drinking, Gaming, Company-keeping, as many do, but wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much in Reading, and took de|light, when his other business afforded him any leisure, to be amongst his Books and Papers; and very ready he was upon occasion for the help of others upon such accounts. Alas, a young man of <HI>a serious Spirit,</HI> that is of some <HI>weight and worth,</HI> that is something besides meer froth and vanity, that mindes something worthy a man, is too rare a sight amongst us. Oh the exceeding vanity of the younger sort! (and too many of the elder too) Alas, what a meer <HI>Bubble of Vanity,</HI> wrapped up in a bundle of fine Clothes, is many a young Man, many a Maid? their clothing may be costly, but their hearts, their mindes (as the Wise-man speaks, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.20) <HI>are little worth.</HI> O how empty are they of all that is of worth, that good is, but running over with meer vanity, <HI>and superfluity of naughtiness,</HI> as the Apostle speaks, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.21. Mens mindes and mouthes run over with very froth and vanity, scarce a serious thought in the one, or a sober savoury word in the other; not a Bible or a good Book in hand the week long it may be: you had a better Example in him then this comes to.</P>
<P N="3">3. This young man (as is credibly testified of him) was <HI>a dutifull Childe to his Parents</HI>; he was inured to bear the yoke from his youth: he could almost say, as the Son in the Parable to his Father, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.29. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> transgressed I at any time thy commandment.</HI> Never but once (as himself was saying to an intimate Friend of his not long before his deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) was he unseasonably absent from his Fathers Family in all his life. Young men, I am afraid it is not once, nor twice, nor thrice, nor ten times, that will excuse some of you. 'Tis the complaint of Parents, of Masters, (and a sad complaint it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) that they cannot keep their Children, their Servants in, but that they will be out at all hours, and if you observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, the bottom&punc; Argument is, <HI>Others do so, and they must and will.</HI> O that you would be perswaded to follow his better Example.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="44" REF="000183_0043_0FA3158185F3DD60">4. To adde no more: He was a young man that <HI>seemed to savour of, and aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct the best things.</HI> What is said of young <HI>Abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ah,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 14.13. appeared very hopeful concerning h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, that <HI>in him there was found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel.</HI> I do not doubt but that it may be truly said of him, That he had more Sermons by him of his own hand-writing, not onely then the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the young men in <HI>Fair|field,</HI> but then most of his Age have. His writing Sermons at Meeting was commendable and mutable, as also the after-improvement that he made of them; his Notes were not laid by as useless, or served to put under Pies, but they were overlook'd and repeated by himself, and to others as occasion offered. The Sermons that he took here the last Win|ter (as I am informed) have been since called over in his Fathers Family. That he was ready and forward upon such accounts, is the account that such give of him that best knew him; and as to this, there is one thing more that would not be omitted, That when he came now lately out of the <HI>Bay,</HI> a little before his last Sickness, that being at Sea upon the Sab|bath, and seeing the Morning well spent, and nothing going forward of a Sabbath dayes work, he began to minde them (though the youngest of the Company) of the Day, and Duty thereunto belonging, desiring they might go to Prayer, and he would repeat a Sermon to them, which ac|cordingly he did both Forenoon and Afternoon. Young men, let I be|seech you his Example upon these accounts Provoke your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mitation.</P>
<P>Secondly, As in these things observable in him as to his <HI>Life,</HI> he was <HI>a Patern for your Imitation</HI>; so in some things observable about him as to his <HI>Death,</HI> he was <HI>an Example for your Admon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</HI> Very briefly but to touch upon two or three things, lest I utterly tire you.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Time of his Death,</HI> being in <HI>the flower of his Age,</HI> little more then Eighteen, is <HI>for your Admonition,</HI> to <HI>Remember now your Creator in the dayes of your youth,</HI> who are now in your bloss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me&punc; he was not ar|rived at the strength of his Age, he was but newly come as it were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o years of discretion; Art thou past a Childe? dost thou begin to under|stand thy self? it is dangerous for thee to put off God, the <HI>remembring thy Creator</HI> not for a longer, but for any time: Art thou Fifteen, Sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en, Eighteen years old? it is too great an adventure to put it off till thou art Twenty, or One and twenty.

The Example that is before thee
<PB N="45" REF="000183_0044_0FA31582486CEFC8">
in this young man (whom Death scarce suffered to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may convince thee of the contrary. O who would not be alwayes ready, when his Summons are so exceeding uncertain.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Manner of his Sickness</HI> is Admonitory also, and may lesson you this, That <HI>it is good doing your great Work before the evil dayes of Sick|ness come.</HI> Alas, there is little time, room, opportunity or abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity then, A pained Body, a distempered Brain, a disturbed Spirit, disability of Speech, necessary Rest, and these and those Attendances, incapacitate, di|vert, take up the time, and leave men commonly but a sorry opportu+nity of doing any thing to purpose for their Souls. I was with him di|vers times in his Sickness, yet had opportunity but once to say any thing to purpose to him; one wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, another while distempered in his Head, or busily taken up by his bodily necessities and attendances. O man&punc; Death may snatch thee away suddenly, it doth not give every one a week or ten dayes warning, but if not, a leisurely Sickness may afford thee little leisure for thy Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. How it was with him in his <HI>Sickness</HI> too, how his Spirit wrought, may admonish you <HI>to make thorow work of your great Work.</HI> It was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffi|cult to him to speak from an obstruction in his Throat, and somewhat difficult to understand him when he did speak, and so the less can be said, but so much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> substance might be gathered from him, That he looked upon himself an undone man without an interest in Jesus Christ; yet he was not without some hope that he was at peace with God in him, yet not without fears, bemoaning himself in respect of his hardness of heart and blindness of minde, and that he had been no more throughly wrought upon by the Means that he had formerly enjoyed. O Sirs, Dying times are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rying times; to die causlesly confidently I am afraid is too common, but to die groundedly comfortably is a great work. O do, do throughly what thou hast to do, man, when Death comes thou wilt not finde it is too well done.</P>
