<P>_AS the Time drew near for the Appearance of the <HI>great God, and our Saviour,</HI> to dwell with Men on the Earth, there was a wonderful Expectation, among almost all Nations, of some great Personage, to be born into the World, who should be remark|able, beyond any that had gone before him: To

<PB N="3" REF="003389_0005_0FF823FD5DD2A0D8">
may reasonably suppose, had some little Ac|quaintance with the Jewish Writings, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doubtless the famous <HI>Sibilline</HI> Prophecys, were Origi|nally some Scraps and Fragments of the <HI>Iewish.</HI></NOTE> to ex|pect some such mighty Person, as they spoke of.

<P>The Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> first makes known the Prophecy to <HI>Daniel,</HI> and about, 532 <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daniel</HI> had the Revelation in the first Year of <HI>Cyaxeres,</HI> or <HI>Darius</HI> the <HI>Mede</HI> who was Son of <HI>Ast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ages,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Ahasuerus</HI>; and about 80 Years before the Decree was given forth, which he speaks of in his 9th ch.

call His Name JESUS <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> I.26, 31.</NOTE>, who should be the <HI>Immanuel,</HI> or God with us.</P>
<P>At the Time of the Birth of this wonder|ous and holy Child <HI>Iesus,</HI> (perhaps,) the same <HI>Gabriel</HI> is made the Joyful Messenger, of this glad Tydings, to the Shepherds, who were watching over their Flock, by Night, near <HI>Bethlehem</HI>: Of which we have an Account in my Context.</P>
<P>The Birth of Christ was attended with a strange Appearance in the Heavens, for an un|usual Light, or Star, shone over <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> the Place of His Nativity, at the Time of it <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> II.9</NOTE>: Which, (no doubt) was the same Star, that the Wise Men of the East, or certain <HI>Magi</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> saw in their own Land, and were directed by to find out the Place of our Lord's Nativity <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th.</HI> II.1, 2, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This Light; or Star, the Shepherds, that were watching over their Flocks, near the City of <HI>David,</HI> beheld, and were surprised at so uncommon an Appearance in the Heavens. But the Angel appeared to them, and said, <HI>Fear not; for behold, I bring you good Tydings of great Ioy, which shall be unto all People; for unto you is born, this Day, in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Christ, the Lord.</HI> The Shepherds encouraged, and directed, by the Angel, went immediately to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="003389_0007_0FF8240107623E58">
and there found it as the Angel had told them <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> 12&punc; 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are several things observable in the Words of my Text; but there are but Two or Three, which I shall more particularly take Notice of, to discourse unto you on, at this Time, and upon this Occasion. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. The Birth, or Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Time of His Birth, or when it was.</P>
<P N="3">III. The great End and Design of His In|carnation and Birth. I shall begin with the first of these; and accordingly,</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to consider the <HI>Birth,</HI> or Incarna|tion of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD. <HI>Unto you there is born, Christ the Lord.</HI> And here, there are several Things worthy our Consideration, with respect to the Birth of Christ; as,</P>
<P N="1">I. The Certainty of the Birth, and Incarna|tion of Christ the Son of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. Of whom he was born, and</P>
<P N="3">III. The Place of His Nativity, where he was born. I shall offer something to each of these. And</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall consider the <HI>Certainty</HI> of the Birth and Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of God.</P>
<P>And what can be more evident and certain than this is? What that we do not see with
<PB N="6" REF="003389_0008_0FF824036A8066D0">
our Eyes, is confirmed to us by so many, and various kinds of Witnesses? The Angel published it to the Shepherds, assuring them, that <HI>unto you is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord</HI>: That is, the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of God, and Saviour of the World. And this the Shepherds had full Proof and Evidence of, when they went to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and accor|ding to what the Angel had told them, found <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother, and <HI>Ioseph,</HI> the reputed Father, and <HI>the Babe lying in a Manger.</HI></P>
<P>This was further confirmed by the Wise Men of the East. For they (concluding the Strange Star they had seen in the Heavens, was an Indication of the Birth of the great Prince, spoken of in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Writings, and which the World was now earnestly looking for) after they had travelled some Hundreds of Miles from <HI>Persia,</HI> to satisfy their Curio|sity about this wonderful Phaenomenon, at length came to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Iudea,</HI> near to which the Star, or Light, had been seen pendant <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">or perhaps, moving from the East to the West, towards <HI>Ierusalem</HI>; as Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> supposes, <HI>Chron.</HI> p. 165.</NOTE>, and enquire, <HI>where is He that is born King of the Iews? For we have seen His Star in the East:</HI> And when they were informed, by the learned Men among the <HI>Iews,</HI> that <HI>Bethlehem</HI> was to be the Place of the Nativity of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> they travelled thither; and the Star, which they
<PB N="7" REF="003389_0009_0FF82405666E5160">
had seen in the East, appeared again to them, and went before them, until it stood over the Place where the young Child lay, and so di|rected them to the particular House, in this miraculous manner, that they might not be im|posed upon by any suppositions Birth; and <HI>they came into the House, and saw the young Child with Mary His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him, &mdash; and presented unto Him, Gold and Frankincense, and Myrrh</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 2.1. &mdash; 11.</NOTE>. Thus they confessed Him to be GOD, by the Adoration they pay'd to Him, at the same Time that their Senses convinced them, that He was really MAN, partaking of the same Flesh and Blood with themselves.</P>
<P>Besides there were many Witnesses at the Birth of <HI>Christ.</HI> For when <HI>Ioseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> had travelled from <HI>Nazareth</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> to be taxed, or enrolled <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Taxing spoken of in <HI>Luke</HI> II.1. was only an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+rollment of the People, in order to be taxed; and the Tax was not levyed upon them till several Years after, when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria.</HI> v. 2&punc; See Dr. <HI>Prid</HI> con. vol 4. p. 918, 919.</NOTE>, that Decree of <HI>Au|gustus,</HI> which necessitated the <HI>Iews</HI> to retire to their own City, to which they and their Families originally belonged, had brought a great Concourse of People to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> so that the <HI>Inn,</HI> where the Mother of our Lord took up her Lodgings, was so full, that she could have no Conveniency, answerable to
<PB N="8" REF="003389_0010_0FF824079F448440">
her Circumstances of falling into Travail, and therefore they layd the Young Child <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Manger, because there was no room for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Inn</HI>; which the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> particular notice of, <HI>Ch.</HI> II. <HI>v.</HI> 7. From whence it is plain, that, from the great Mul|titude of Travellers then present, there could be no Fraud in this Birth, but <HI>Mary</HI> really brought forth her first born Son.</P>
<P>And further, <HI>Herod</HI> the King, fearing the Loss of his Kingdom, from this Child, who was styled <HI>the King of the Iews,</HI> by the Wise Men of the East, and slaying all the Young Children in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> from two Years old, and under, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> 2 16.</NOTE> that he might pre|vent the Evil which he feared, adds Confir|mation to the Truth and Certainty of the Incarnation of our Lord.</P>
<P>This Child, thus born into the World, was no other than the Accomplishment of the an|cient Promise of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of God, appearing in the human Nature: For it was the Divine <HI>Logos,</HI> the Eternal Son of God, that <HI>became Man,</HI> and was born of a Woman. Hence our Lord said, <HI>Ioh</HI> III.16. <HI>God so loved the World that he gave His only begotten Son.</HI> And thus at the Baptism of our Savi|our, it was declared by an audible Voice from Heaven, <HI>Matt.</HI> III.17. <HI>This is my beloved Son:</HI> And the Devils themselves confessed Him
<PB N="9" REF="003389_0011_0FF80F8A9EBC9760">
to be the Son of God, saying, <HI>Matt.</HI> VIII.29. <HI>What have we to do with Thee, Iesus, thou Son of God.</HI> So true is it, what the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> tells us, <HI>Ch.</HI> I.14. <HI>The Word was made Flesh, and dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> among us, and we be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eld His Glory, the Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</HI> Thus <HI>God was manifest in Flesh.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I am in the next place to consider <HI>of whom Christ</HI> was born; namely, of a <HI>Virgin</HI> the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> And therefore we are told of <HI>Mary, Luke</HI> II.7. That <HI>she brought forth her first born Son,</HI> which is spoken of <HI>Christ.</HI> And that this <HI>Mary</HI> was a pure <HI>Virgin,</HI> who had never known a Man, when she brought forth this her first born Son, is evident from the Conference of the Angel with her. For we are told, <HI>Luke</HI> I.17. That the Angel <HI>Gabriel was sent to a Virgin, espoused to a Man whose Name was Ioseph</HI>; and at <HI>v.</HI> 31. he tells her, that <HI>she should conceive in her Womb, and bring forth a Son, and should call His Name Iesus.</HI> And when the holy <HI>Virgin</HI> was surprised at his saying, as well she might be, and replyed, <HI>v.</HI> 34. <HI>How shall this be, seeing I know not a Man?</HI> The Angel ex|plains the Mystery to her, and lets her know, that the holy Child, which should be born of her, should not originate in the Common Way of Generation, but by a Divine Incuba|tion, or the Almighty Power of God forming a Child in her Womb, without the natural
<PB N="10" REF="003389_0012_0FF8240A43F32778">
and ordinary Means therefor: <HI>v.</HI> 35. <HI>The Angel answered, and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that holy Thing, which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</HI> Such was the miraculous and immaculate Concep|tion of the Blessed <HI>Iesus</HI>!</P>
<P>This also the Gospel of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> takes notice of, and informs us, <HI>Matt.</HI> I.18. That <HI>Mary was</HI> but <HI>espoused to Ioseph</HI>; and that, <HI>before they came together, she was found with Child by the Holy Ghost.</HI> This is further con|firmed by <HI>Ioseph</HI>'s Carriage to her, upon this Affair; for he finding her to be with Child, while she was contracted to him, and before their coming together, concluded she had been guilty of Fornication (or rather Adultery, as being his espoused Wife) and therefore in|tended to have put her away, and have no|thing further to do with her; till an Angel from God satisfyed him of her Innocency, that she was a <HI>pure Virgin,</HI> who had not been guilty of any criminal Conversation with any Man, but <HI>was with Child by the Holy Ghost.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.19, 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>In all of this was but fulfilled what was anciently praedicted concerning the <HI>Messiah.</HI> For the very first promise of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> seems to imply no less, than that He should
<PB N="11" REF="003389_0013_0FF8240C37BA9A00">
be born of a pure <HI>Virgin,</HI> without any carnal Concubinage; and therefore He is called <HI>the Seed of the Woman, Gen.</HI> III.15. Where the <HI>Woman</HI> only, and not <HI>Adam,</HI> the <HI>Man,</HI> is taken notice of, as from whom the <HI>Messiah</HI> should proceed, who should <HI>bruise the Ser|pents Head.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> III.15.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this was more plainly spoken of, by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, Ch.</HI> VII.14. <HI>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his Name Immanuel.</HI> I know the latter <HI>Iews,</HI> and with them the Atheists and Deists of the present Age, would fain per|swade us, that by <HI>Virgin,</HI> here is meant, <HI>a Young Woman,</HI> in general, whether marryed or unmarryed; and they suppose it no such mighty matter for a Young Woman, especial|ly if marryed, to bring forth a Son; and they suppose further that the Woman intended is, the Prophets Wife, who should have another Son, and before that Son, now to be born of her, should know to refuse the Evil, and choose the Good, <HI>Ahaz</HI> should be delivered from the Enemies that now encamped against him.</P>
<P>But to make this matter plain, I need on|ly to observe, that as it was no such great thing for a Woman to bear a Son; so a Wo|man, in the general, or a marryed one in parti|cular, bringing forth a Son, would not amount to the Nature of a Sign, which is what the
<PB N="12" REF="003389_0014_0FF8240DD4F714A8">
Prophet is evidently here speaking of. And besides the learned in the Hebrew Language agree, that the Word <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> from <GAP DESC="foreign"> to <HI>hide,</HI> or <HI>keep close.</HI> This Word is seven times used in the Old Testament, and in all of them signifyes, an <HI>uncorrupted Virgin.</HI> See Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> Exer. <HI>Heb.</HI> p. 220, 221.</NOTE> translated <HI>Virgin,</HI> properly signifies an <HI>undefiled Virgin,</HI> one that has not been marryed, nor ever known a Man; and so the <HI>Iews,</HI> who best knew their own Language, understood it.</P>
<P>But then let us consider the Design of the Prophecy, and that will greatly enlighten this matter. The evident Design of this Prophecy was to Comfort and encourage <HI>Ahaz,</HI> who, with <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> was in great Fear, that the Combination of <HI>Resin,</HI> King of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Pekah,</HI> King of <HI>Israel,</HI> now investing <HI>Ierusa|lem</HI> with their united Forces, would carry all before them, and utterly destroy the Royal Stock, the House of <HI>David&punc; Ahaz,</HI> obsti|nately (or perhaps modes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y) refused to ask a Sign, as the Prophet proposed to him, and therefore the Prophet tells him, <HI>the Lord him|self shall give you a Sign</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> VII.11.14.</NOTE>. Now a Sign ever means something out of the ordinary Course, or beyond the Power of merely natu|ral Causes, and yet evident to our Senses; and what this Sign should be, the Prophet tells him in the next Words, <HI>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call
<PB N="13" REF="003389_0015_0FF82410192E6D28" MS="y">
His Name Immanuel.</HI> Tho' it be but agree|able to the Course of Nature for a Woman to conceive, and bear a Son, yet for a pure <HI>Virgin</HI> to do so, is beyond the Power of Second Causes; and it's being something unheard of, and ex|ceeding the ordinary Power of Nature, is that which rendred it a Sign. Now this being but a Repetition, in other Words, and in a strong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Light, of the ancient Prophecy concerning the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who was to be the <HI>Seed of the Wo|man,</HI> and of the <HI>Lineage of David,</HI> was there|fore an Assurance to <HI>Ahaz,</HI> and the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> that they should not be utterly destroyed, because the <HI>Messiah</HI> was yet to come; so that they had no need to be so terribly affraid of the threatned Destruction&punc; for God will certainly remember His Word, and make good His Promise to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> and to the House of His Servant <HI>David.</HI> And because this locked a great Way off, and did not seem to carry in it that Encouragement which was necessary to scatter their present Fears, the Prophet from God, further tells <HI>Ahaz</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>v</HI> 16.</NOTE>, that <HI>before this Child,</HI> (meaning, and perhaps,) pointing to his young Son, <HI>Shear-jashub,</HI> (whom God orders the Prophet to take with him <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>v.</HI> 3.</NOTE>, and who is no otherways concerned in this whole Affair, unless in this particular Transaction,) <HI>before this Child shall know to refuse the Evil, and
<PB N="14" REF="003389_0016_0FF82412851F7A48">
choose the Good, the Land, which thou abhor|rest, shall be forsaken of both her Kings.</HI> That is, <HI>Resin,</HI> and <HI>Pekah,</HI> the <HI>two Tails of these Smoaking Fire-brands,</HI> (as they are cal|led <NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4</NOTE> should both of them be withdrawn from distressing <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and be speedily cut off; as it came to pass within a little while after: for <HI>Pekah</HI> was cut off by <HI>Hoshea,</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">II. <HI>Kin.</HI> xv.30.</NOTE>, and <HI>Resin</HI> by the King of <HI>Assyria</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">II. <HI>Kin.</HI> xvi.9.</NOTE>; by which means <HI>Ahaz</HI> and <HI>Iudah,</HI> were wholly deliver|ed from the Desolation threatned by these two combined Adversarys.</P>
<P>So that the Sign, which the Lord gave <HI>Ahaz</HI> by His Prophet, concerning <HI>a Virgin</HI>'s <HI>conceiving, and bearing a Son,</HI> was but a fur|ther Ratification of what God had promised to His People of old, and therefore an Assurance to <HI>Ahaz,</HI> that the House of <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Iudah</HI> should not be destroyed, because His Promise yet remained to be made Good to them; which make the Words to be a clear Praedicti|on, of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s being born of a <HI>Virgin</HI>; and it was punctually fulfilled in His Birth of the Blessed <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The third thing I am to consider, relating to the Birth of Christ, is the <HI>Place</HI> of it.

<P>To bring about the Fulfilment of this Prophecy, the Roman Emperor, <HI>Augustus,</HI> about the Twenty fourth Year of his Reign, orders a general Survey to be made of the whole Roman Empire, which Survey extended to the Provinces dependant upon the Empire, as well as the Citizens of <HI>Rome</HI>; by which Enrollment, every one was obliged to repair, to <HI>their own City,</HI> as the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> in|forms us, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">to <HI>Luke</HI> II.3</NOTE>; that is, the City where their Ancestors had their Original, there to have

And thus <HI>Christ</HI> was born in <HI>the City of David,</HI></P>
<P>Now besides a literal Accomplishment of the Prophecy of <HI>Micah,</HI> concerning the Place of the <HI>Messiah's</HI> Nativity, here was also a plain Proof, of His being of the Royal Stock, of <HI>David,</HI> and so <HI>King of the Iews.</HI> For the Promise of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that was to come into the World, was firstly confined to the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns of <HI>Abraham,</HI> afterwards to the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and lastly to the Family of <HI>David,</HI> and accordingly the Survey that led <HI>Ioseph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> the <HI>City of David,</HI> proves them both to be of the Line of <HI>David,</HI> and descended from his Stock.

<P>Thus much may suffice to have spoken to the <HI>Birth of Christ,</HI> the Certainty of it, the Person of whom, and the Place where. I shall now proceed to the Second thing I proposed, namely,</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the <HI>Time</HI> of our Blessed Lord's Nativity, or when <HI>Christ</HI> was born. And this I shall do, first more generally, and then more particularly.</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall consider the <HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth more <HI>Generally.</HI> And there are especially Two Prophecies, which I shall take Notice
<PB N="18" REF="003389_0020_0FF8241AA371E5F8">
of, as pointing to the Time of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s appearing in the World, both of which have had their full Accomplishment in the Coming of Christ.</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> I shall mention is the famous Pro|phecy in <HI>Iacob</HI>'s Blessing his Son <HI>Iudah,</HI> which is contained in <HI>Gen.</HI> XLIX.10. <HI>The Sceptre shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until Shiloh come.</HI> By <HI>Shiloh</HI> is meant the <HI>Mes|siah,</HI> as the <HI>Iews</HI> themselves before our Savi|our's Time ever acknowledged. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the three Targums, <HI>Onkelos</HI> written before Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Time, and <HI>Ionathan</HI>'s and the <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> written after it&punc; agree in applying this to the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> Exer. <HI>Heb</HI> p. 97.</NOTE> The Design of the Prophecy is a general Assurance that the Sovereign Power shall remain in the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> unto the Time of <HI>Shiloh,</HI> or <HI>Christ,</HI> His appearing in the World, after which all Sovereign Power should be lost from among the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation. And this has been very punctually fulfilled.</P>
<P>For it is very evident, that this foreign Power continued in the Tribe of <HI>Iudah,</HI> in a Line of Kings that descended from <HI>David,</HI> from his Time, down to the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Cap|tivity; and in the Time of that Captivity, tho' their State was exceedingly broken, yet were they governed, in <HI>part,</HI> by Rulers of their own set over them, in the Land of <HI>Iudea,</HI> and <HI>chiefly,</HI> by their own Laws, and
<PB N="19" REF="003389_0021_0FF8241C9E47BD50">
their own <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> or Council, which still preserved something of the Sovereign Power, even in their Dispersions among the <HI>Babylo|nians</HI>; till at length the <HI>Persian</HI> Emperour fully restored the Sovereign Power to them. And thro' all the Disturbances which they afterwards met with, from the <HI>Syrian,</HI> and <HI>Egyptian</HI> Princes, yet still they had some of the Sovereignty among them, even to the Birth of <HI>Christ.</HI> For at that Time, <HI>Herod</HI> who, we are told <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Prid.</HI> con. vol. IV. p. 935.</NOTE>, descended from a Family of the <HI>Iews,</HI> was King over them; however they were governed chiefly by their own Laws, and had the <HI>Power of Life and Death,</HI> which is the highest Act of Sovereignty, to be found among them. But&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Time of <HI>Christ</HI>'s appearing, that Sovereign Power was wholly lost; and never more recovered by them.

See the <HI>Appendix.</HI></NOTE>, reigned one Year after <HI>Christ</HI>'s Birth, and <HI>Archelaus,</HI> who succeeded him, reigned Ten Years, and the very next Year, which was the Twelfth of our Lord's Nativity, and the Year He first appeared in the Temple, manifesting something of His Glory, in Disputing with the Doctors there, the <HI>Romans,</HI> having seized <HI>Iudea,</HI> by the Hands of <HI>Pub. Sul. Quirinius,</HI> whom <HI>Luke</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="003389_0022_0FF8241EA22E6D60">
calls <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> annexed it to their Empire, and placed a <HI>Roman</HI> Governour over it, and sub|jected it to the <HI>Roman</HI> Laws. From this Time, the <HI>Sceptre departed from Iudah</HI> and <HI>Law|giver from between His Feet</HI>; and this was more plainly evident, when, not many Years after, the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, under <HI>Titus,</HI> destroy|ed their City, and Nation, since which Time they have had no Pretensions to Sovereign Power.</P>
<P>This therefore proves, that the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the promised <HI>Shiloh,</HI> was then come, and that He came about the Time when <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> first appeared in the World, and whatever the latter <HI>Iews</HI> pretend, yet the former readily confessed they had lost their Sovereignty, when they said, <HI>Ioh.</HI> XVIII.31. <HI>It is not lawful for us to put any Man to Death</HI>; and when they replied to <HI>Pilate,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Go|vernour, (who brought forth <HI>Iesus</HI> to them, a little before His Crucifixion, and said, Behold your King,) <HI>we have no King but Caesar, Ioh.</HI> XIX.15.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The other Prophecy, I would take notice of, relating to the Time of the Birth of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> is that remark|able one of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> IX 24&punc; &mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>, <HI>Se|venty Weeks are determined upon thy Peo|ple, and upon thy holy City, &mdash; know therefore, and understand, that from the go|ing forth of the Commandment, to restore
<PB N="21" REF="003389_0023_0FF824211D5ACD10" MS="y">
and to build Ierusalem, unto the Messiah, the Prince shall be seven Weeks, and three|score and two Weeks; (the Street shall be built again, and the Wall, even in troublous Times:) and after threescore and two Weeks shall Messiah be cut off.&mdash; He shall confirm the Covenant with many for one Week; and in the latter half of the Week He shall cause the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease.</HI>&mdash; The <HI>Seventy Weeks</HI> are allowed by all to mean <HI>Weeks of Years,</HI> according to the Prophetick Style, that is, 490 Years. These <HI>Seventy Weeks</HI> are divided into <HI>Three Periods,</HI> name|ly <HI>Seven Weeks,</HI> or 49 Years, to <HI>restore and to build Ierusalem, Sixty two Weeks,</HI> or 434 Years, from thence to the <HI>appearing of the Messiah the Prince.</HI> And <HI>one Week,</HI> or seven Years from thence, for the confirming of the Covenant; which last Week seems to have a Sub-division belonging to it, by the Expression, <HI>in the Dividing,</HI> or in the <HI>latter Part of the Week, the Messiah the Prince shall be cut off, and finish Transgression, and make an End of Sin</HI>; or put an End to all other Sacrifices for Sin by the Sacrifice of Himself.</P>
<P>The main Difficulty here is, to understand, what Decree, or Commandment is intended by the Prophecy, that we may know, from whence to Date the 70 <HI>Weeks,</HI> or 490 Years: For there were several Decrees issued out, in Favour of the <HI>Iews,</HI> by the <HI>Persian</HI> Em|perours.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003389_0024_0FF824231A6FAF58">The <HI>first</HI> was in the First Year of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> of which we read, <HI>Ezra,</HI> I. <HI>begin</HI>: But this could not be the Commandment spoken of by <HI>Daniel,</HI> which was to <HI>restore and to build Ierusalem</HI>; because this Decree had its special Reference to the Building of the <HI>Temple,</HI> and had no particular Regard to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> nor was any further concerned about it, than as the rebuilding the Temple necessarily requir|ed their Inhabiting in some Place near to it, and no doubt but <HI>Cyrus</HI> was influenced to make this Decree, for the <HI>Iews</HI> to return and rebuild their Temple, in Honour to that God, who had, according to his ancient Prophecies concerning him, raised him to his Grandeure, and so long before hand praedicted his Birth, Name, and Reign <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> XLIV.28.</NOTE>; and therefore he prae|faces his Decree, with this, as the Reason of it, <HI>The Lord God of Heaven hath given me all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and he hath charged me to build Him an House in Ierusa|lem, which is in Iudah</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezra.</HI> I.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Second</HI> Decree issued out from the <HI>Persian</HI> Court, about 18 Years after the former, by <HI>Darius,</HI> the Son of <HI>Histaspis,</HI> which came to the <HI>Iews,</HI> at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> about the beginning of his fourth Year <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Prid.</HI> con. vol.

spoken of by <HI>Daniel</HI>: for this was chiefly a Recital and Confirmation of the former De|cree made by <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and, as we may see in the Body of the Decree, was confined to the Buil|ding the Temple, and the Service thereof, on|ly with this Addition, that the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> who endeavoured all they could to obstruct the Building of the Temple, were now obli|ged to pay the King's Tribute to the <HI>Iews,</HI> to help bear the Charge of the Work.</P>

with the History of those distant Times, no Man can certainly tell, on what Day His Birth was. This I think is confessed by all that have laboured most in the Search after it. But then tho' the individual <HI>Day</HI> cannot be particularly and positively determined, yet we may come pretty near the Time, and be able to discover the <HI>Month</HI> of our Saviour's Nativity, by observing some things, which lye plain before us. As</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We may observe what St. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, <HI>Luke</HI> II.8. <HI>There were in the same Country,</HI> (viz. <HI>Bethlehem) Shepherds, abiding in the Field, and keeping watch over their Flocks by Night.</HI> Now it is well known, that <HI>Iudea</HI> is a cold Country, in the Winter Season <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When <HI>Herod</HI> in his War with <HI>Antigonus,</HI> had slain <HI>Pap|pus</HI> his General and cut off most of the Army, and might by marching di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ectly to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> have mastered it, and put an intire End to the War. Dr <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</HI> tells us, he was forced to neglect the Opportunity because of <HI>the Severity of the Winte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which now approached, the Souldiers not being able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear lying any longer abroad.</HI> con. vol. IV. p. 738.</P>
<P>And when most of the Flocks in <HI>Iudea</HI> were consumed with the Drought, in the 13th Year of <HI>Herod,</HI> the <HI>Dr.</HI> men|tions it as a great Act of charity in him to take care to bring Wool eno' into the Land to provide Cloathing for the Inhabitants against Winter, to defend them from <HI>all the Se|verities of it con. vol.</HI> IV p. 852.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> remarks, that this Time of the Year (<HI>Dec.</HI> 25.) was unfit for the travelling of the <HI>Iews</HI> to the Enrollment, for the Shepherds watching their Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ks by Night, as well as for the Lying-Inn of the blessed Virgin in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Stable. <HI>Hist.</HI> p. 164. and St. <HI>Iohn</HI>&punc; tells us, the day <HI>Christ</HI> suffered (<HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,) the <HI>Servants made a Fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it was cold.

<PB N="29" REF="003389_0031_0FF82431D0B29CC8">
Frost and Snow not a great deal short of what they are sometimes, among us: And therefore the dead of Winter can by no means be tho't a proper Season, for the Shepherds to be a|broad, in the Field, watching their Flocks by Night. So that it looks very unlikely, from this Circumstance that the Nativity of <HI>Christ</HI> should be in the Depth of the Winter.</P>
<P>But then, <HI>Secondly,</HI> we know that our Lord entred upon His Publick Ministry, at, or a|bout, the compleating of his <HI>Thirtieth</HI> Year, which the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> takes particular Notice of, <HI>Luke</HI> II.23. <HI>Iesus himself began to be about</HI> 30 <HI>Years of Age,</HI> that is, it was about the compleating of His 30th Year. This refers to the Time of His Baptism, and entrance, upon His Publick Ministry; for in His return from <HI>Iordan,</HI> He was led by the Spirit into the Wilderness, and having there mastered the Temptations of the Devil, <HI>from that Time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at Hand</HI>; as we read <HI>Matt.</HI> IV.17.</P>
<P>Now it is generally supposed that <HI>Christ</HI> continued His Publick Ministry, for the space of <HI>Three Years and an Half,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Prid.</HI> Vol. IV. p. 94<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, and then suf|fered and Dyed. For <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> preached three Years and an half, as the Forerunner of our Lord, and then Christ himself Three and an half more, which makes the last <HI>Week,</HI> or
<PB N="30" REF="003389_0032_0FF82434DDE4D500">
<HI>Seven Years,</HI> spoken of by <HI>Daniel,</HI> for the <HI>confirming the Covenant.</HI> So that there was evidently an odd <HI>Half</HI> Year in the life of <HI>Christ.</HI> And it is very plain, that He was crucified at the Time of the <HI>Iews</HI> Passover, as appears from, <HI>Ioh.</HI> XVIII.39. and XIX.14. which was upon the 15th Day of the Month <HI>Nisan,</HI> that is about the last of our <HI>March,</HI> or beginning of our <HI>April</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> fixes it to the 3d of <HI>April, Har.</HI> p 193.</NOTE>. Deduct half a Year from this, and it carrys back the Birth of <HI>Christ</HI> to the <HI>Iews</HI> Month <HI>Tisri,</HI> a|bout the Feast of Tabernacles, which answers to the latter end of our <HI>September,</HI> or begin|ning of <HI>October</HI>; at which Time, it may well eno' be supposed, the Shepherds might lye out in the Field, watching their Flocks by Night.</P>
<P>So that tho' we cannot find the very indi|vidual <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Nativity, yet it can be proved, almost to a Demonstration, that He was born in or near to <HI>Tisri,</HI> sometime in <HI>Sep|tember</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> about the Time of the Creation of the World, and about the Four Thousandth Year from the Creation. But I am to enquire,</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether the Day of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Nativity ought to be kept, in Memorial of His Birth?</P>
<P>You all know, that a great Part of the Christian Church observe This very Day, the <HI>Twenty Fifth of December,</HI> in Remembrance of the Day of the Nativity of our Lord. But
<PB N="31" REF="003389_0033_0FF8243757A7BD88">
whether there be any Obligation lying upon us, as Christians, to keep such a Day, will be seen by observing a few things.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is to be observed, that no Church can keep the <HI>true Day,</HI> on which <HI>Christ</HI> was born: Because it is not known to the World, as I have already remarked. And it looks something odd, to select a Day, and keep it, in Memorial of <HI>Christ</HI>'s being born on <HI>that</HI> Day, when, at the same Time, they know it was not the Day of His Nativity. And, by the Way, because the Day is not known in the World, this is a very cogent Proof, that there was no such Custom in the primitive Church as the keeping the Birth Day of <HI>Christ.</HI> For if there had been any such Practice in Use in the first Ages of the Church, doubtless they would have known the Particular <HI>Month</HI> bet|ter, if not the individual <HI>Day</HI>; because they lived so near, to the Time of it, that it would have been no great Difficulty, to have infor|med themselves thorowly, if they had had any particular Regard to <HI>that Day,</HI> above all the Days in the Year.</P>
<P>This Usage was firstly introduced by the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. For when <HI>Rome</HI> became <HI>Christian,</HI> perhaps a Willingness to oblige the <HI>Pagans,</HI> as much as might be, moved them to take <HI>their Festival Days,</HI> which they were so mightily fond of, and convert them to a <HI>Christian Use</HI>; hoping, by this Means, the

<Q>That the Christian Holy Days, or solemn Commemorations of our Saviour and His Apostles &mdash; seem to have been first fixed by the Christian Church not on the Days of their Births or Deaths, of which generally they were wholly Ignorant, but on the Sun's Entrance into Signs, especially those that were the Equinox, and Solstice Days, and on such Days as were noted among the Heathen, and were Days of Riot and Idolatry; that so those pernicious Solemnities of the Heathen Worship&punc; and Remains of the Heathen Su|pertision, might, by Degrees, be supplanted and worn off, by the holy and Spiritual Solemnities of the Christian Religion. Thus because the Sun's ingress into Signs, in our Saviour's Time, generally happened on the 24th or 25th Days of each Month, we have upon Nine or Ten of our Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Christian Holy Day on one of those Days, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be commonly scarce another in the whole Month.

and Debauchery: The Observation of which alone, one would think, should make a considerate Person very cautious, how he em|braced a Custom that is so vilely abused, when there is no plain Institution for it. For,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is to be observed, that there is no Divine Command for the keeping such a Day. If the Particular Day were known, which it is not, yet it is plain, there is no Injunction from <HI>Christ,</HI> or His <HI>Apostles,</HI> to ob|serve it; and much less to observe any other Day in Commemoration of it. The Weekly Sabbath has a Divine Sanction for it, as a Day sacred to the Duties of Religious Worship, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> XX.8, 9, 10.</NOTE>, and as a Memorial of the <HI>Resurrection of Christ</HI> from the Dead <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> XXVIII 1. compare with <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> XX 19, 26. and <HI>Act.</HI> XX.7. and <HI>Rev.</HI> I.10.</NOTE> by which the great Work of Redemption, and End of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Incarnation, was accomplished. But no one that I know of, pretends to any Divine Com|mand for the keeping of <HI>Christmass,</HI> or a Day in Commemoration of the Birth of <HI>Christ.</HI> And then,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It very much looks, as if God never intended there should be any such Day observed; not only in that, He has not com|manded it, but in that, He has kept the Day <HI>Hid</HI> and <HI>Secret</HI> from the World. For had it seemed meet to the Divine Wisdom, that such a Day should have been kept, in after Genera|tions,
<PB N="34" REF="003389_0036_0FF8243D233D2DE0" MS="y">
in Commemoration of the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> as a means to promote our Faith, and Holiness, doubtless there would, at least, have been left some very plain Footsteps, of that remarkable Day, if not some general Intima|tion of the Observation of it. For otherwise, the hiding it from the World, would be a de|signed keeping hid from us, one very proper means to promote our Faith and Holiness, which is far from being consistent with the Divine Goodness, under the full and clear Light of the Gospel. But tho' the Birth of the great Saviour was so remarkable a Time, from the miraculous Appearance of a Light, or Star, over <HI>Bethlehem</HI>; the mighty Stir, which the Tidings of the Birth of <HI>the King of the Iews,</HI> which soon reached <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> occasioned a|mong the <HI>Iews</HI>; and from <HI>Herod</HI>'s having his Fears so much awakened, by the Report, as to slay all the Male-Children in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> under two Years old; and from the wise Men of the East, who had seen His Star, in the East, travelling a long Journey to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> to Worship the Child; yet, notwithstanding all these re|markable Occurrents, the Day of <HI>Christ</HI> Na|tivity was not so much taken Notice of, as to be left upon any certain Record.

<P>Upon all which, I cannot see the least Room to suppose, that there is any Obligation lying upon Christians, to observe any Day, in Com|memoration of the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> much less the Day that is kept as such.</P>
<P>But I pass to the Third, and last, thing I proposed to speak to, from these Words, in which I shall use all convenient Brevity: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. To consider of the great <HI>End and De|sign</HI> of the Birth and Incarnation of <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> This is plainly pointed at in my Text; unto you is born a <HI>Saviour, Christ the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>So that the main End of His Birth was, to be a SAVIOUR unto the World. Therefore it is that, <HI>That Word,</HI> which, the Apostle tells us, was in the Beginning, and was
<PB N="36" REF="003389_0038_0FF8244274F68478">
with God, and was God, <HI>was made Flesh, and dwelt among us</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ioh.</HI> I 1, 14.</NOTE>; that is, became Incar|nate, and was born of a Woman, without which He could not have been a <HI>Saviour</HI> to us. For tho' he might have Taught, and Governed us, with|out taking our Flesh upon Him; yet he could not have had a Body, to offer as a Sacrifice for us, if He had not taken our Nature upon Him; and without This there could have been no Salvation.</P>
<P>To this the ancient Types and Praedictions concerning Him looked; and this He Himself assures us of, when He says, <HI>Ioh.</HI> III.17. <HI>God sent not His Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World, thro' Him, might be saved.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iews</HI> ever expected the promised <HI>Mes|siah</HI> would be a <HI>Saviour.</HI> But then <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> was not born into the World, to be such a <HI>Saviour</HI> as they imagined and looked for, only a <HI>Temporal Saviour,</HI> to deliver that Nation from all their Enemies, and erect a Tem|poral Kingdom, in greater Pomp, and Gran|deure than had ever yet been seen among them. No; He was born to be a <HI>Spiritual Saviour,</HI> which is by far the Greater; He became In|carnate to save his People from Sin, and Death, from Guilt, and the Wrath and Curse of God, which that Guilt had exposed them to. And
<PB N="37" REF="003389_0039_0FF824448030A138">
accordingly the Evangelist <HI>Matthew</HI> informs us, <HI>Matt.</HI> I.21. <HI>He came to save his Peo|ple from their Sins, and therefore is His Name called Iesus.</HI> And the Apostle, in his Epistle to the <HI>Galations,</HI> acquaints us, what was the End of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Incarnation, when he says, <HI>Gal.</HI> IV.4, 5. <HI>When the fullness of Time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons. Iesus Christ</HI> became Incarnate, to recover us from the Power and Dominion of Sin, and the De|vil over us, and the Sentence of Condemnati|on that was out against us, and to restore us to the Favour and Friendship of God, and a Life of Obedience to Him; to entitle us to the Dignity and Priviledges of the Children of God, and to regain that Heaven and Hap|piness for us which we had lost.</P>
<P>Thus he was born a <HI>Saviour</HI>; and that not to the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation only, but to the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, even to all Nations of Men, who have the Grace of God appearing to them in the Gospel of <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> our Lord; for He is given to be <HI>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the Glory of His People Israel</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> II.32.</NOTE>: And therefore <HI>we Gentiles</HI> walk in the Light of the glorious Gospel, and have the Offers of

<P>And the two Names by which He is here described declare him to be so. He is CHRIST, this is His Name, and peculiarly His. He went by the Name of <HI>Messiah,</HI> under the old Testament Dispensation, which converted into <HI>Greek,</HI> is CHRISTOS, being of the same meaning with the Hebrew Word ME|SHIAC, <HI>the anointed.</HI> For Him hath God the Father anointed and consecrated to the high Office of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> having constitu|ted and seperated Him <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> X.36. and VI 27 and <HI>Act.</HI> X.38.</NOTE>, to this very Work; that by His Life and Doctrine He might teach and instruct the World of Man|kind, and so rescue it from the Power and Ty|ranny of the Flesh, the World, and the Devil; and that as our high Priest He might make Attonement for us and reconcile us to God by His Blood, which He hath offered, as a Sacri|fice well pleasing and acceptable, to His eter|nal Father. This shews Him to be an <HI>authen|tic Saviour,</HI> and gives Validity to His Actions, in that He was anointed and consecrated to this very End and Purpose, and <HI>did not take this Honour to Himself, but was called of God, as was Aaron,</HI> Heb.

<P>This was the great End of His Incarnation and Birth, thus to be a SAVIOUR, and therefore is He LORD and CHRIST.</P>
<P>There are some other things considerable in my Text; but I may not proceed any further at this Time. Let the Use of what has been said, be,</P>
<P>USE I. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us, to adore the Faith|fulness of God, and be encouraged to Believe, and Trust in His Word.</P>
<P>Let us adore the Faithfulness of God, in Fulfilling the Word He has spoken, in the exact Accomplishment of so many of His an|cient Prophecies, as we have seen, and particu|larly that great one; on which the whole Welfare of Mankind depended, His sending the <HI>Messiah,</HI> a SAVIOUR, into the World. And since we see, that God has so punctually made Good His Word, in so many Instances, let us learn, never to Disbelieve, or Distrust the Word of God, but live in the full Expectation of the exact Accomplishment of such of the Prophecies, as yet remain to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>Let us learn hence, to Live in a quiet De|pendance upon the Word of Promise, which
<PB N="41" REF="003389_0043_0FF8244DADC87580">
God has made unto His People; for tho' their Circumstances should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver so difficult, and the greatest Darkness should surround them, so that they can see no possible Way left for their Escape, yet God is True, and in His own Time, and Way, can, and will, appear for their Help, and grant Deliverance to them out of all their Troubles.</P>
<P>And especially should we learn hence, to Trust God with the Fulfillment of His Pro|mises to us, relating to our future State, even the Hope of Eternal Life, which God, that cannot lye, has promised, before the World began, upon our Faith and Obedience to His Son; and be encouraged thereby to a constant unwearied Abounding in all the Duties of the Christian Life, as knowing, we shall certainly reap, if we faint not; for <HI>Faithfull is He that has promised,</HI> and will perform it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> X <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. Hence, since the Son of God is become Incarnate, let this serve to teach us our Duty, and our Comfort.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Duty</HI>; that we be exceeding careful, not to debase that Nature, which the eternal Son of God has taken into an Union to Him|self. That therefore, we do not allow our selves in any Sin whatever, but cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and perfect Holiness in the Fear of God; be|cause all Sin is a debasing of the Humane Na|ture, and brings a Stain and Blemish upon it,
<PB N="42" REF="003389_0044_0FF8244F4A604000">
and is therefore to cast Indignity upon the Son of God Himself, who has highly exalted our Nature, in being united to our Flesh.</P>
<P>It speaks the <HI>Comfort</HI> of all true Believers also. For now we have a SAVIOUR, who partakes of the same Flesh and Blood with our selves, and therefore who sincerely desires our Happiness, who has a Fellow-Feeling with us in all our Sufferings, who knows our Tempta|tions and Sorrows, and has a most tender Com|passion to us under all our Wants and Weak|ness, <HI>who will not suffer us to be tempted a|bove what we are able, but will, with the Temptation find out a Way for our escape, that we may be able to bear it</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I. <HI>Cor.</HI> X.13&middot;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now the MAN JESUS, in Union to the SON of GOD, is exalted at the right Hand of the Throne of the Majesty on High, who, having, the Dominion put into His Hands, will certainly over-rule, all things for the Welfare of His Church; will gather in the whole Number of his Elect, and not suf|fer one of them to be lost; will cause all things to work together for Good to them that Love God; and will ransom their Bodies from Destruction, and bring them to dwell in His Presence thro'out Eternal Ages.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Let us all then, make it our great Care, that this <HI>Saviour</HI> be Ours, that
<PB N="43" REF="003389_0045_0FF824524B4BAD88">
we are interested in Him, and share in His blessed Benefits.</P>
<P>This is the great Design of the whole Gos|pel of <HI>Christ,</HI> His Incarnation and Life, His Doctrines and Example, and His Sufferings and Death, to prevail with a guilty World, to se|cure an Interest in Him, that they may be saved by Him. And if the wondrous Grace of God, in providing such a Saviour for us, should after all be slighted by us, and we re|fuse to accept of His offered Mercy, and sub|mit our selves to Him as our Lord, it will but greatly enhanse our Account, and encrease our Punishment, that God has sent His Son, to ap|pear in our Flesh, as a <HI>Saviour</HI> for us, but we would not come unto Him, that we might have Life.</P>
<P>Let us all then, be perswaded to take this <HI>Iesus</HI> for our <HI>Saviour,</HI> rejoicing in the good Tydings, and praising the Grace of God that has provided Him for us, saying, in the Doxo|logy of the holy Angels, in my Context, <HI>Glory to God in the highest, on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men</HI>!</P>
<P>Let us receive Him as the anointed of God, and firmly believe all that He has done, and suffered for us, and spoken to us; and give up our selves to Him to be saved by Him; and submit our selves intirely to His Govern|ment, as our LORD; for He will not be our <HI>Saviour,</HI> unless we know assuredly that

He is LORD, as well as CHRIST <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Act</HI> II 36&punc;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Think not that this is eno' to entitle you to His Benefits, to call your selves after His Name, or be very fond of keeping a Day in Commemoration of His Birth, while, at the same time, you practically deny Him, by a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng your selves in such Courses of Intem|perance, Injustice and Profanity, as are a scandal to the Christian Profession, and would be a Re|proach to a sober Heathen.</P>
<P>'Tis indeed but a common Appendage to vain Superstition, to be mightily concerned for the Outside, and regard the shew only, while the Inward and vital Part of Religion, pretend|ed to be promoted thereby, is greatly neglect|ed. This we have a sad Instance of, in those that are so strongly set to keep a Day in Com|memoration of the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> (any Day rather than none;) that instead of observing it in an Holy and Religious Manner, and im|proving it as a Means to mortify Sin, and pro|mote Holyness of Heart and Life, (as one would be ready to suppose, in Remembrance of the Birth of <HI>the Holy Child Iesus</HI>;) it is more generally, a Day seperate to Vanity and Folly, to Sin and Debauchery, to Revelling and Drunkenness, like the ancient <HI>Saturnalia</HI> of the Heathen. Would to God that those, who think themselves obliged to keep such a Day, would, at least, think themselves obliged
<PB N="45" REF="003389_0047_0FF8245616D2B660">
also to act the Part of Christians, and not fly in the Face of the <HI>Holy Saviour,</HI> while they pretend to do him Honour. But I hope you have not <HI>so learned Christ,</HI> as to imagine that you honour Him, while you really sacrifice to Devils, in the Indulgence of your Lusts.</P>
<P>Let us then learn to Commemorate the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> every Day of our Lives, by Living in the constant Remembrance, that <HI>to us the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord</HI>; that <HI>Christ,</HI> a Saviour from Sin, has appeared in our Nature, has given us a most Holy Law, and set us a most bright Example, has dyed for our Offences, and risen again for our Justifi|cation; and as This Grace of God teaches us, let us sincerely <HI>deny Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and live soberly, righteously, and Godly, in this present World; presenting our Bodies,</HI> and our Spirits, <HI>to Him, a living Sacrifice, holy and Acceptable, which is but a reasonable Service.</HI></P>
<P>Thus endeavour, by a truly vertuous and religious Walk, to live the Life of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>shew forth the Praise of Him who hath called you out of Darkness into marvel|lous Light</HI>; then will the Incarnate Son of God be <HI>your Saviour,</HI> and his Birth will be un|to <HI>you good Tydings of great Ioy,</HI> and you may with Comfort <HI>look for the Blessed Hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ, who gave Him|self for us, that He might redeem us from

<HEAD>APPENDIX. An Attempt to State the <HI>true Year</HI> of the Birth of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>I Readily, and thankfully, acknowledge the Assistance I have received, from Dr. <HI>Pri|deaux</HI>'s noble <HI>Connection of the Old Testa|ment with the New,</HI> which I have chiefly followed in the <HI>Chronology,</HI> and very much so in the Explanation of the Prophecies in the foregoing Discourse; since the Composing of which, Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s <HI>Chronology of the Old Testament, and Harmony of the New,</HI> has fal|len into my Hands, which I had not seen be|fore; and the Difference I observed between them, and my own Difficulty in reconciling either of their Accounts, to what I tho't the Evangelist <HI>Luke</HI> pointed to us, namely the Age of <HI>IESUS CHRIST,</HI> when He was Baptised, (which would help to Direct us to the Time of His Birth,) has led me to spend more Time, than the First Composing the Sermon would allow me, in a diligent Enqui|ry into the True Year of the Birth of CHRIST. And tho' it is very apparent that I <HI>now</HI> fix the Birth of CHRIST up|on
<PB N="48" REF="003389_0050_0FF8245DD5A9BEF0">
a Different Year from that mentioned in the Foregoing Sermon, and go off from it al|so in some other smaller Matters; yet, I sup|pose, it may well eno' be allowed me, in a more general and common Discourse, to fall in with the Current of the best of Writers, in a piece of <HI>Chronology,</HI> while in a more parti|cular and laboured one, afterwards, I see rea|son to fix upon other Periods of Time. For having, I think, diligently surveyed, and compared, Dr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>; and taking their Quotations upon Trust, as well I may, and not having the Au|thors by me; I conclude I may, with good Reason, advance the following Proposition, wherein I crave Leave to dissent from those two Great Men; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That our Blessed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, was born, some Time in <HI>October, Anno Iul. Per.</HI> 4711.</P>
<P>To make good this Proposition, which is so New, and different from what all others, that I know of, have said upon this Subject; I shall first, state the exact Time of our Lords Death, and then produce the Arguments, which sway with me, to fix his Birth upon the Year men|tioned.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Blessed Lord was crucified upon <HI>Fri|day,</HI> the 15th of <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an,</HI> in the Year of the <HI>Iul. Per.</HI> 4746. It is evident, fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the Evangelists, that our Lord was crucified upon
<PB N="49" REF="003389_0051_0FF824601EBB2C18">
the <HI>Iews Passover,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> XXVI, 17. <HI>Mark</HI>&punc; XIV.12.16. <HI>Luke</HI>&punc; XXII. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> III.28, 39.</NOTE> which always was 14 Days after the <HI>New-Moon,</HI> which began their Month <HI>Nisan,</HI> their first Ecclesiastical Month; and it is further evident, from the same Evangelists, that this 15th of <HI>Nisan,</HI> happened, that Year, upon a <HI>Friday,</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> XVII.62. XXVIII.1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> XV.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Luke</HI> XXIII 54. <HI>Ioh.</HI> XIX.31.</NOTE> the Day before the <HI>Paschal Sabbath,</HI> which was an high Day.</P>
<P>Now Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI> makes it plain, to a De|monstration, by calculating the several <HI>New-Moons,</HI> that the 15th Day of <HI>Nisan,</HI> could fall upon a <HI>Friday,</HI> only in the Year mention|ed. For we are, by many other things, con|fined, in our Enquiry, to three or four Years; and for several Years, both before and after the 4746th Year of the <HI>Iul. Per.</HI> the Changes of the Moon would admit of no such Conjuncti|on, as <HI>Friday</HI> and the 15th of <HI>Nisan,</HI> but on|ly upon that Year. So that the Year of our Lord's Death, is fixed, and certain, and both Dr. <HI>Prideaux,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI> agree in it, that it was <HI>An. P. I.</HI> 4746. in the 19th Year of the Reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> alone, or his 22d, from his being taken into Partnership in the Empire with <HI>Augustus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The Time of our Saviour's Death being thus fixed; the Arguments, that prove His Birth to have been in the Year 4711. <HI>I. P.</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="003389_0052_0FF82461B4182A98">
are, the Age of our Saviour at His Baptism, and Entrance upon His publick Ministry; the Time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Death; and <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Ban|ishment; and the Baptist's Conception.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> JESUS CHRIST, was Baptised, and entred upon His publick Ministry, at 30 Years of Age, <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4741. This appears from these Considerations.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> It seems Evident&punc; (as Mr. <HI>W.</HI> plainly proves, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm. Ch.</HI> IX.</NOTE>) that there were <HI>Five</HI> Passovers in the Time of our Lord's Ministry, upon the last of which He died; which five Passovers in|clude Four compleat Years, and brings us back, from 4746, to the Passover in 4742, as the first Passover in our Lords Ministry, mention|ed, <HI>Ioh.</HI> II.13.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> At this First Passover, in the Beginning of the Year 4742, our Lord is apparently in the Publick Exercise of His Ministerial Office. His Whipping the Buyers, and Sellers, out of the Temple: His having His Disciples about Him; His Discourse of His Death, (taken Notice of, in <HI>Iohn, Ch.</HI> II.) as well as His publick Baptizing, (<HI>Ioh.</HI> III.26.) is an evi|dent Proof of this, that JESUS CHRIST was then in the Discharge of His publick Ministry.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> JESUS CHRIST was Baptised, and entred upon His publick Ministry, some Time before this first Passover. This appears
<PB N="51" REF="003389_0053_0FF82464117F85D0">
from what the Disciples of <HI>Iohn</HI> say to him, <HI>Ioh.</HI> III.26. <HI>He that was with thee, be|yond Iordan, to whom thou bearest Witness,</HI> &amp;c. Plainly alluding to what St. <HI>Matthew</HI> tells us, <HI>Ch.</HI> III 13. <HI>Iesus cometh from Gali|lee, to Iordan, unto Iohn to be baptised of him</HI>: And from the evident token of His be|ing the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> by the Spirits de|scending and resting upon Him <HI>Iohn,</HI> from that Time, bears Witness to Him, <HI>Ioh.</HI> I.32, 33. And it is further Evident, both from St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> Ch. IV. <HI>Luke</HI> Ch. IV.</NOTE> that after His Baptism, our Lord underwent the Forty Days Fast, and Temptation, in the Wilderness, re|turned from <HI>Iordan,</HI> to <HI>Gallilee,</HI> preached the Gospel, called (at least some of) His Dis|ciples, and wrought several Miracles which were Acts of His publick Ministry, and then came up to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to the First Passover. Now less than Half a Year could not well suf|fice for all these Transaction, and about Half a Year might well eno' give Time for these several Occurrents; so that this brings us back from <HI>Nisan,</HI> the <HI>Iews</HI> first Month in <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4742, to about the Feast of Tabernacles, in the Month <HI>Tisri,</HI> their first political Month, <HI>An. I.

which Mr. <HI>W.</HI> himself fixes upon <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> JESUS CHRIST was <HI>Thirty</HI> Years old at His Baptism. This the Evange|list <HI>Luke</HI> takes particular Notice of, <HI>Ch.</HI> III.23. <HI>Iesus Himself began to be about Thirty Years of Age.</HI> Mr. <HI>W.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 136.</NOTE> supposes, and Endeavours to prove, that the <HI>Greek</HI> word, here rendred, <HI>be|gan,</HI> does not relate to the Age of CHRIST, but of His Ministry, and renders it, <HI>Iesus was about</HI> 30 <HI>Years of Age when he began His Ministry.</HI> So that the Evangelist does not mean the Beginning of CHRIST's <HI>Thir|tieth</HI> Year, but rather the Compleating of it; that He was about 30 Years old, suppose a few Weeks, or Days more or less. Now the Age of CHRIST, thus specified by the Evan|gelist, is not connected with the 15th or 12th Year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> when the Gospel of the Kingdom first began to be preached, as Mr. <HI>W.</HI> seems to imagine, but it is plainly connected with His Baptism, just before spoken of, <HI>Luke</HI> III.12. The particular Remark, in the Be|ginning of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> en|tring upon his Office, in the 15th or 12th of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> was designed to measure out the Pro|phet <HI>Daniel</HI>'s last <HI>Week</HI> of Years; for it was exactly <HI>Seven</HI> Years from that Time, to the Death of CHRIST: The <HI>Baptist,</HI> who be|gan His Ministry at the Paschal Feast, <HI>An.

<P>So that since our Lord's publick Ministry&punc; at the Time of His Baptism, commenced Four Years and an half before His Death, (which certainly was in <HI>Nisan, An. I.

<PB N="54" REF="003389_0056_0FF8246C56B124A0">
will be further confirmed by what follows.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. Herod</HI> dyed the Latter End of the Year <HI>I. P.</HI> 4711. That JESUS CHRIST was born before <HI>Herod</HI>'s Death, is evident from the Gos|pel of <HI>Matthew,</HI> where we have an Account of <HI>Herod</HI>'s seeking the Life of CHRIST in His Infancy <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt. Ch.</HI> II.</NOTE>; and yet the Birth of CHRIST was not long before the Death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>For the Wise Men go from <HI>Herod</HI> to <HI>Beth|lehem,</HI> and find the Virgin and her Child there, where, being very much of a Stranger, as ap|pears by her Lodging, we cannot suppose her to stay longer, than the Business of the En|rollment, or her Child-birth necessitated; nor can it be supposed, that <HI>Herod,</HI> who was then at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> would wait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Days, for the return of the Wise Men from <HI>Bethlehem</HI> (but about 6 or 7 Miles Distant, e'er he would perceive himself deceived by them, and fall into that Rage, which occasioned the hor|rid Slaughter of the Young Children, at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI></P>

So that the Flight to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and return from thence, was all over before the Purification; and yet <HI>Herod</HI> was then dead <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> II.20, 22.</NOTE>
<PB N="55" REF="003389_0057_0FF8246ED80FC270">
all of which as Mr. <HI>W.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rm</HI> p. 165.</NOTE> argues, shews that the Birth of CHRIST could not be much above a Month before the Death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 150.</NOTE> indeed fixes upon <HI>Nov. An. I. P.</HI> 4710, for the Time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Death; but tho' it might happen some Time in that Month, yet I think it was in the following Year.</P>
<P>For <HI>Herod</HI> is allowed by all, to have reign|ed 34 Years, (somewhat more or less,) from the Death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> the last of the <HI>As|monoean</HI> Family, and not from his usurping the Government 3 Years before. Mr. <HI>W.</HI> tells us <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm</HI> p. 152.</NOTE> that <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was taken by <HI>Sosius,</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> after about half a Years Siege, upon the Latter-End of <HI>Iune, An. I. P.</HI> 4677&punc; and tho' he seems to suppose, the taking of the City, and the Death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> to have been at one and the same Time, or within the Distance of Three or Four Days, yet there really was a very considerable Space of Time between them. For, Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> informs us <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Connec.</HI> Vol. IV. p 743.</NOTE> that after the Caption of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and having kept <HI>Antigonus</HI> sometime in Chains, <HI>Sosius,</HI> upon <HI>Antonies</HI> return out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and coming to <HI>Antioch,</HI>
<Q>sent this Captive King thither to him. <HI>Antony</HI> at first in|tended to have reserved him for his Triumph. But <HI>Herod,</HI> not thinking himself safe in his
<PB N="56" REF="003389_0058_0FF82471E2CCE3C8">
Kingdom, as long as this Remainder of the old royal Family continued alive, never left soliciting <HI>Antony,</HI> till at length&punc; by a great Sum of Money, he obtained that this poor Prince was put to Death.</Q></P>
<P>Now if we consider, that some Time was clapsed before <HI>Antony</HI> came to <HI>Antioch,</HI> that then <HI>Antigonus</HI> is sent a Captive in Chains to <HI>Antioch,</HI> above 200 Miles distance from <HI>Ie|rusalem,</HI> if I mistake not; and the Pains <HI>He|rod</HI> is put to, (which doubtless occasioned the Dispatch of Messengers backwards and for|ward this 200 Miles,) before he could, over|come the <HI>Ambition</HI> of <HI>Antony,</HI> and compass the Death of <HI>Antigonus</HI>: I say whoever con|siders this, will see it needful to allow, <HI>Two,</HI> if not <HI>Three</HI> Months, from the taking of <HI>Ie|rusalem,</HI> to the Death of <HI>Antigonus</HI>; and so his Death, and the Date of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign, will fall in with the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> or rather of <HI>September</HI>; to which if we add the 34 Years of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign, it brings us down to the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> or <HI>September, An. I. P.</HI> 4711&punc;</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W.</HI> himself says <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm</HI> p. 153.</NOTE>, we must look for <HI>Herod</HI>'s Death, as near as possible to <HI>Iuly, A. I. P.</HI> 4711; (I would rather say to <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> in that Year) and yet he chooses to place it in <HI>Nov. A. I. P.</HI> 4710, which certainly is further distant from the fixed <HI>Iuly,</HI> (much
<PB N="57" REF="003389_0059_0FF8247385ABB8A0">
further from the real <HI>September</HI>) than <HI>Nov. A. I. P.</HI> 4711.</P>
<P>The Difficulty that attends this Matter, seems to arise, from the Uncertainty, whe|ther there were redundant, or defective Months, belonging to <HI>Herod</HI>'s 34 Years; one or other of which appears certain, and yet no ancient Historian has told us which. But tho' this is not handed down to us with Certainty, yet, from what has been observed, we may rea|sonably conclude, that there were some few Months, over and above 34 Years belonging to <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>For, it <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign commence from the Time of the taking of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> in the lat|ter End of <HI>Iune,</HI> there must be full <HI>Seven</HI> Months deducted out of his 34 Years; but if his Reign Commence from the Death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> as all Historians agree it does, there must be at least <HI>Nine</HI> or rather <HI>Ten</HI> Months deducted, to bring his Death to the Latter-End of <HI>Nov. An. I. P.</HI> 4710. And doubtless few Historians would call that 34 Years, which really was but 33 Years and some few Months.</P>
<P>But, on the other Hand; if <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign take its Date from the Caption of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> then there is scarce <HI>Five</HI> Months, but if, as is the Truth, from the Death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> then there remains not <HI>Three,</HI> or rather not <HI>Two</HI> Months more than the 34 Years for his Reign, to bring his Death to <HI>Nov. An. I. P.</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="003389_0060_0FF82475DAD00380">
4711. which also is the nearest <HI>Nov.</HI> to <HI>Iuly,</HI> (rather to <HI>Sept.) An. I. P.</HI> 4711.</P>
<P>Now it seems much more likely, that <HI>Io|sephus,</HI> the Jewish Historian, should omit ta|king Notice of <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> redundant Months, in assigning 34 Years to <HI>Herod</HI>'s Reign, than that he should include <HI>Nine</HI> or <HI>Ten</HI> de|fective ones, much the bigger half of the Year, in the whole Sum of 34 Years, which he tells us <HI>Herod</HI> reigned: and therefore I conclude that <HI>Herod</HI> dyed sometime in <HI>Nov. An. I. P.</HI> 4711. which will be further evident from the Reign and Banishment of <HI>Archelaus.</HI> And if we sup|pose, the Transactions, from the taking of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to the Death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> took up 4 or 5 Months, which is not unreasona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it is not to be wondered at, that <HI>Iosephus</HI> took no Notice of a few Weeks in the Reign of <HI>Herod.</HI> Since therefore <HI>Herod</HI>'s <HI>Death</HI> was in the latter part of the Year, <HI>I.

There is nothing more clear, (from the History of the Gospel, <HI>Matt.</HI> II.19, 20, 21, 22.) than that <HI>Archelaus</HI> immediately suc|ceeded his Father <HI>Herod,</HI> in the Government of <HI>Iudea,</HI> without any considerable Space of Time intervening. For <HI>Ioseph</HI> was first in|formed,
<PB N="59" REF="003389_0061_0FF824776C5E8540">
of the Death of <HI>Herod,</HI> by an Angel, while as yet the common Report of it had not reached so far as <HI>Egypt,</HI> but about 70 or 80 Miles off; upon which Information, he arises and travels to the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> and when he comes there, he learns that <HI>Archelaus reigned in Iudea, in the Room of his Father Herod</HI>: So that there could be no Interregnum, at most not of a Weeks Length, if of a Days.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Reign consisted but of lit|tle more than <HI>Nine</HI> Years. Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Connec.</HI> Vol. IV. p 929,</NOTE> assigned the whole Sum of <HI>Ten</HI> Years to the Reign of <HI>Archelaus</HI>; but this seems to have been done to make the Length of his Reign comport with the Death of his Father <HI>Herod,</HI> which he places in <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4710. Where|as, in Reality, <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Reign contained but little more than <HI>Nine</HI> Years in it; for Mr. <HI>W.</HI> assures us, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 155.</NOTE> from <HI>Iosephus,</HI> that <HI>Ar|chelaus,</HI> the Successor of <HI>Herod,</HI> in <HI>Iudea,</HI> reigned somewhat above <HI>Nine</HI> Years, before his Banishment; which plainly speaks but lit|tle more than <HI>Nine</HI> Years.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Banishment was in the 37th Year of the <HI>Egyptian Aera.</HI> This <HI>Egyptian Aera</HI> had it's Rise from the Con|quest of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by <HI>Octavianus,</HI> afterwards <HI>Augustus,</HI> and its Name from the <HI>Actiac</HI> Victory, which <HI>Octavianus</HI> obtained over <HI>An|tony,</HI> near <HI>Actium</HI>; and was therefore called
<PB N="60" REF="003389_0062_0FF8247BA2F599A8">
the <HI>Aera</HI> of the <HI>Actiac Victory.</HI> Now Mr. <HI>W.</HI> informs us, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 155.</NOTE> from <HI>Iosephus,</HI> that <HI>Arche|laus</HI> was banished about the Beginning of the 37th Year of the <HI>Actiac Victory.</HI> Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Connec.</HI> Vol. IV p. 818.</NOTE> acquaints us that this Victory was obtained upon <HI>Sept.</HI> 2d, <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4683. but then he also assures us, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">p. 833.</NOTE> from <HI>Dion Cassius,</HI> that by a Decree of the <HI>Roman</HI>'s, the <HI>Aera</HI> of the <HI>Actiac Vic|tory</HI> did not commence, until the 29th of <HI>Au|gust, An. I. P.</HI> 4684. Almost a full Year after, when <HI>Octavianus</HI> had entirely reduced <HI>Egypt</HI> under his Obedience. So that the <HI>Aera</HI> of the <HI>Actiac Victory</HI> being certainly fixed upon <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4684, we must necessarily understand <HI>Iosephus</HI> who wrote about 148 Years after <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iosephus</HI> wrote his History 86 Years after <HI>Christ.</HI> i. e. <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4832.</NOTE> to date his 37 <HI>Years</HI> from thence; or else we must sup|pose him to give us an <HI>Aera</HI> not known or used in the World, by any but himself; which is altogether unreasonable.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W.</HI> from <HI>Dion Cassius,</HI> places the Ban|ishment of <HI>Archelaus An. I. P.</HI> 4719. but it is very evident, that tho' 37 Years from the <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>Victory</HI> brings us to 4719, yet not so from the Date of the <HI>Aera.</HI> For 37 compleat Years added to <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4684. the true <HI>Aera</HI> of the <HI>Actiac Victory,</HI> brings us down to <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. <HI>An I. P.</HI> 4721. But because <HI>Iosephus</HI> says <HI>Archelaus</HI> was
<PB N="61" REF="003389_0063_0FF8247D36E86968">
banished in the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the 37th Year, let us deduct 8 or 9 Months, from <HI>Aug.</HI> 29. 4721, and it leaves us in the Latter-End of <HI>Nov.</HI> or <HI>Dec. An. I. P.</HI> 4720, in the Be|ginning of the 37th Year of the <HI>Actiac Victory.</HI> And accordingly, Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Chro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ological T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble,</HI> at the End of his IV. <HI>Vol.</HI></NOTE> Ends the Reign of <HI>Archelaus</HI> in the Year, <HI>I. P.</HI> 4720. So that the Latter End of the Year <HI>I. P.</HI> 4720. is undoubtedly fixed for the true Time of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Banishment. And from <HI>Dec. An. I. P.</HI> 4720. let us deduct the some|what above <HI>Nine Years</HI> of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s Reign, and it carries us back to <HI>Nov. An. I. P.</HI> 4711. for the Commencing of his Reign, upon the Death of his Father <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Reign and Banishment of <HI>Arche|laus</HI>; confirms the Death of <HI>Herod,</HI> and the Birth of CHRIST, to have been, <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4711. as is asserted in the Proposition.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Conception of <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> was sometime in <HI>August, An. I. P.</HI> 4710&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P N="1">1. It is well known, that the <HI>Iewish Priests</HI> were divided into, Twenty four Courses, and that each Course served it's Week at the Tem|ple: And we are assured, that <HI>Zachariah,</HI> the Father of <HI>Iohn,</HI> was of the Course of <HI>Abiah, (Luke</HI> I.5.) which was the <HI>Eighth</HI> Course in Order. (I. <HI>Chron.</HI> XXIV.10.)</P>
<P>The Order of these Courses was restored after the Captivity, and whatever Interrupti|on was given to them, during the broken State
<PB N="62" REF="003389_0064_0FF8247F42043088">
of the <HI>Iews,</HI> before the Time of the <HI>Mac|cabees,</HI> yet there was none after <HI>Iudas Mac|cabeus</HI> restored them, till the final Determi|nation of them at the Siege of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> by <HI>Titus,</HI> as <HI>Scalliger</HI> observes. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>W. Harm.</HI> p. 156.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now Mr. <HI>W.</HI> informs us <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harm.</HI> p. 157.</NOTE> from the famous <HI>Iewish Chronicle,</HI> that when the Temple was burnt, by the <HI>Romans,</HI> upon <HI>Aug.</HI> 4th <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4783, it was the Course of <HI>Ioiarib,</HI> or the first Course, and the Sabbath concluding that Weekly Course; which also he shews, from the first Sabbath after the Restitution of the daily Sacrifice by the <HI>Maccabees.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is plain, that <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Course, and the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Conception, must be more than a Year before the Birth of CHRIST. With|out this Allowance, there would not be Room for <HI>Elisabeth's</HI> Hiding herself Five Months, before the <HI>Virgin's</HI> Conception, and for the Time of the holy <HI>Virgin</HI>'s Praegnancy, to her Deliverance.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Course went out upon <HI>Aug.</HI> 5th <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4710. Having taken the Pains to calculate the Courses of the <HI>Priests,</HI> from <HI>Ioiarib,</HI> the first, finishing his Course upon <HI>Aug.</HI> 4th <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4783. I find <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s, or the <HI>Eighth</HI> Course to go out, <HI>Aug.</HI> 5th <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4710. which fixes the Time of the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Conception to the Beginning of that <HI>August</HI>; and allows between
<PB N="63" REF="003389_0065_0FF82480DE5B8F88">
Two and Three Months more than a Year to the Birth of CHRIST, in <HI>October An. I. P.</HI> 4711.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Whiston,</HI> by a like Calculation, observes the Time of <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Ministration to fall on the Beginning of <HI>Sept.</HI> as it truly does, <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4709. and he Assigns <HI>October</HI> 25th the Year after, for the Time of the Birth of CHRIST. But if he had more thorowly re|remarked the Times, I imagine, he would have seen, that his fixing <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Course to the Beginning of <HI>Sept. An. I. P.</HI> 4709. as he ne|cessarily must, for that Year, would have de|stroyed his main Design, of ascertaining the Birth of CHRIST upon <HI>Octo.</HI> 25. <HI>A. I. P.</HI> 4710, instead of proving it.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Eighth</HI> Course, to which <HI>Zachari|ah</HI> belonged, finishing their Ministration upon <HI>Sept.</HI> 3d, the Sabbath in the first Week of that Month, <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4709, we need only to allow Two Days, from thence, for <HI>Zacha|riah</HI>'s return to his House at <HI>Hebron,</HI> about 30 miles Distant from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and for his Wife <HI>E|lisabeth</HI>'s Conception, which brings us to <HI>Sept.</HI> 5th. From thence we must allow <HI>five Iewish</HI> Months, or 21 Weeks, and 3 Days, for the Time, in which <HI>Elisabeth</HI> is said to <HI>hide her|self,</HI> which brings to <HI>Feb.</HI> 2d, in the Begin|ning of the Year <HI>I. P.</HI> 4710. We must, doubtless, allow another Week, at least, for the Propriety of the Angel's Speech to <HI>Mary (Luke,</HI> I.36. <HI>This is the Sixth Month with
<PB N="64" REF="003389_0066_0FF8248356026640">
her that was called barren</HI>; which leads us to <HI>Feb.</HI> 9th; and the <HI>Nine</HI> Months, of the <HI>Virgin</HI>'s going with Child, will unavoidably bring us to <HI>Nov.</HI> 9th. So that by this Reco|ning the <HI>Virgin</HI> must necessarily have brought forth her first born Son, something more than a Fortnight before her full Time, which may, by no means, be admitted. And therefore upon Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s own Principles, of <HI>Za|chariah</HI>'s Ministration going out, in the Be|ginning of <HI>September, An. I. P.</HI> 4709. JESUS CHRIST cannot be supposed to be born, upon <HI>October</HI> 25. <HI>An. I.P.</HI> 4710. And if the Allow|ances should be made greater than I have pro|posed, (smaller they cannot be) it will render it still but so much the more unlikely, if not impossible.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Course going out upon the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>August, An. I. P.</HI> 4710, as I have observed, the <HI>Two Days</HI> Al|lowance for his Return to his House, and for <HI>Elisabeth</HI>'s Conception, makes <HI>Aug.</HI> 7th for the Time of <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Conception; from whence, the <HI>Five Months,</HI> or 21 Weeks and 3 Days, of <HI>Elisabeth</HI>'s Concealment; brings us to <HI>Ian.</HI> 4th the Beginning of the <HI>Iulian</HI> Year 4711; and a Weeks Entrance into the <HI>Sixth</HI> Month, as before, leads us to the <HI>Eleventh</HI> of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> for the Time of the <HI>Virgin</HI>'s Conception; and <HI>Nine</HI> Months, from <HI>Ian.</HI> 11th to the Time of the Birth, carries us down to <HI>October</HI> 11th in the Year
<PB N="65" REF="003389_0067_0FF82485B2FFA618">
of the <HI>Iulian Period</HI> 4711, the Year and Month proposed in the Proposition. And no other Year but this will receive any Evidence, for the Birth of CHRIST in <HI>October,</HI> from the Principle of <HI>Zachariah</HI>'s Ministration, cal|culated from <HI>Ioiarib</HI>'s being the first Course, and finishing his Ministration upon <HI>Aug.</HI> 4th <HI>An. I. P.</HI> 4783. but if the Principles are good, (and they seem to me to be so) then we receive from them a very strong, and conclusive Evi|dence, of the Birth of CHRIST, upon, or a|bout the <HI>Eleventh</HI> of <HI>October, An. I. P.</HI> 4711. And if the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> of <HI>Tisri,</HI> should have happened upon the <HI>Third</HI> of our <HI>October,</HI> that Year, as the <HI>Fifteenth</HI> of <HI>Nisan</HI> did upon the <HI>Third</HI> of our <HI>April, Thirty-four</HI> Years and an <HI>half</HI> after, when our Lord was crucified, then the Birth of CHRIST, falling upon the 11th of our <HI>October</HI>&punc; was exactly upon the <HI>Eighth,</HI> that <HI>great and last Day,</HI> of the Feast of Ta|bernacles, wherein they were to <HI>keep an holy Convocation to the Lord, and offer an Offering made by Fire unto the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Levit.</HI> XXIII.34, 35, 36.</NOTE>; for then the Son of God came to Tabernacle with Men, (and He did but litterally Tabernacle with them, at His Birth, in the Inn) in order to offer Himself, to His Eternal Father, a Sacri|fice made by Fire, by the Fire of the Divine Anger falling upon Him, in the Day when he took our Infirmities, and bore the Iniquities of us all.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="003389_0068_0FF82487D8BB11E8">Since therefore, there is such a wonderful Concurrence of all these Circumstances, the <HI>Baptism</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> at the Age of 30 <HI>Years</HI>; the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Herod</HI>; and the <HI>Reign,</HI> and <HI>Banishment</HI> of <HI>Archelaus</HI>; and the Time of the <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Conception; all of them so evidently fixing us to the Year of the <HI>Iulian Period,</HI> 4711, and to the Month of <HI>October</HI>: I cannot but look upon it, as more than a vain Conjecture, even, an established Propositi|on, That JESUS CHRIST, our Blessed <HI>Sa|viour,</HI> was born some Time in <HI>October, An.
