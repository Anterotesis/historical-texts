<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Aggravations</HI> attending their Sins, are declared. And what were they?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000700_0007_0FA9A6C8EB61D9A8">One Aggravation of their Sins, was, The Universal <HI>Prevalency</HI> of them. All ranks of men, were sunk into the <HI>Corruption of Manners,</HI> now prevailing In the <HI>Church,</HI> there were Officers more conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rned for their <HI>Livings,</HI> than for the Salva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of <HI>Souls</HI>; and the <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> of God were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ostituted unto the <HI>Lusts</HI> of men, in <HI>Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous Administations,</HI> which put no <HI>Difference</HI> between the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly</HI> and the <HI>Profane.</HI> In the <HI>State,</HI> there were Officers who made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Prey</HI> of the Inhabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ants, and had fetched <HI>Blood</HI> in wrongful Exe|cutions; and <HI>Self</HI> was all they Served.

When, <HI>All Flesh</HI> had thus <HI>Corrupted their way,</HI> in pleasing of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> was high time for an Overwhelming <HI>Inundation</HI> of Calamities!</P>
<P>Another Aggravation of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Sins, was, The Insensibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Security</HI> in them. That men were very Secure under a most Pe|rillous Condition of Affairs, is intimated in the <HI>Text</HI> now read unto us. Wherein,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We have the Peoples <HI>Enj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yment.</HI> That was, An <HI>Hedge.</HI> The Hebrew word here notes, A <HI>Wall,</HI> made either of

<HI>Stone</HI> or <HI>Wood.</HI> The Metaphor Signifies, The <HI>Protection</HI> of God, about our Comforts; with a <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Shelter</HI> from Innumerable Mis|chiefs, whereunto, we should, without that <HI>Protection</HI> be Obnoxious, in this <HI>Present Evil World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> We have the Peoples <HI>Misery.</HI> That was, A <HI>Gap.</HI> The Hebrew word here notes, A <HI>Breach,</HI> at which Destroying <HI>Ene|mies</HI> may make their Entrance. The Me|taphor Signifies, An <HI>Obnoxiousness</HI> to wretch|ed circumstances, by Sin forfeiting the <HI>Pro|tection</HI> of God; with a <HI>Loss</HI> of those things wherein we have that <HI>Protection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> We have the <HI>Expectation</HI> of our God concerning such a People. He sayes, <HI>I Sought for a man, that should make up the Hedge, and stand in the Gap.</HI> It intimates&punc; Not only that <HI>Some One</HI> at least, ought then to have Appeared, by his Pious Interpositions to have diverted the Wrath of God, but also that the Appearance of <HI>One</HI> might have done <HI>Something</HI> towards the Diversion of that Wrath.</P>
<P>So then, there is a most Solemn and Weighty CASE; indeed, the <HI>more</HI> So|lemn and Weighty, because it is, OUR OWN, <HI>Case</HI>: where-with I am now to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you.</P>
