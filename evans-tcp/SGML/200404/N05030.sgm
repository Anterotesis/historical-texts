<HEAD>The Author to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THIS HISTORICAL SUMMARY concerning the <HI>British</HI> Continent Plantations in <HI>North-America,</HI> we published in loose Sheets by way of Pamphlet, <HI>feuille volante,</HI> or <HI>los-blad</HI>; which in their Nature are temporary, and soon lost: but as it is generally well receiv|ed, that it may be more permanent, we publish it in two large Octavo Volumes, each Volume divided into two Parts:</P>
<P>Vol. I. Part 1. contains general Affairs, <HI>viz.</HI> Some Account of ancient and modern Colonies, the first Grants and settling of our Continent Colonies and <HI>West-India</HI> Islands, and the adjoining <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Set|tlements, with Remarks of various Natures.</P>
<P>Vol. I. Part 2. contains, 1. The <HI>Hud|son's-Bay</HI> Companies Settlements, Facto|ries or Lodges, and their Fur and Skin-Trade. 2. <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Cod-Fishery. 3. The Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI>; the Vicissi|tudes under the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Jurisdic|tions. 4. The several Grants united by a new Charter in the Province of <HI>Massach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ts Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Vol. II. Part 1. Concerning the sun|dry other <HI>British</HI> Provinces, Colonies, or Plantations in the Continent of <HI>North-America,</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="006307_0003_0F652D5D1BBA9260">
viz. <HI>New-Hampshire, Rhode-Is|land, Connecticut, East</HI> and <HI>West-Iersies, Pensylvania</HI> higher and lower, <HI>Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina</HI> and <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P>Vol. II. Part 2. is by way of Appendix, containing miscellaneous Affairs, such as the natural History, the Distempers at Times epidemical, and the endemial Dis|eases in these various Climates, with their Paper-Currencies; as also some <HI>Addenda</HI> and <HI>Corrigenda,</HI> particularly, if by Histo|rical Freedoms used, any just Offence (<HI>hu|manum est errare</HI>) is given to Person or Persons, it shall be candidly rectified.</P>
<P>The Writer with Candour acknowledges that in the Affair of Commodore <HI>Knowles</HI>'s Impress in the Harbour of <HI>Boston,</HI> Nov. 1747, there was somewhat of passionate Warmth and Indiscretion, meerly in Affection to <HI>Boston,</HI> and Country of <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> his <HI>Altera Patria</HI>; but not with Rancour or Malice, having no personal Acquaintance nor Dealings with Mr. <HI>Knowles</HI>; therefore from common Fame, he (as Historians do) only narrate his <HI>pecu|liar Temper,</HI> his <HI>Severity</HI> in Discipline, and not so much <HI>Regard</HI> as some other Sea-Commanders have for the <HI>mercantile In|terest,</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="006307_0004_0F652D5DE48F5830">
by impressing their Men, when he thought the publick Service required it: His <HI>general Courage</HI> as a Sea-Officer is not questioned; the <HI>Insinuation</HI> concerning his <HI>personal Courage,</HI> has been construed <HI>a|miss</HI>; the refusing of <HI>passionate Challenges</HI> from private Masters of Merchant Ships, whose Men he had impressed, which per|haps might deprive the Nation of his Ser|vice, is <HI>no Slur.</HI></P>
<P>The Writer declares that he had no other Intention, than by setting the Affair in a strong Light, to contribute towards extend|ing to the Continent Colonies, particularly to <HI>New-England,</HI> a <HI>late Act of Parliament against impressing of Sailors</HI> in the Sugar West-India Islands. Therefore as this Af|fair was temporary, of no Use, and may give Offence, it is suppressed in the present Publication of this first Volume of the Sum|mary. Admiral <HI>Knowles</HI> since he sail'd from <HI>Boston,</HI> has been happy in successful Expeditions, particularly in reducing the Fort of <HI>Port Louis</HI> of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and in beating a superior&punc; <HI>Spanish</HI> Squadron off the <HI>Havannah</HI>; he has been in a Course of <HI>Preferments</HI>; and prosperous as to his private Fortune.</P>

<P>AS Distance of Place does equally or rather more admit of Latitude, for imperfect, erroneous, and romantick Accounts of Affairs than Distance of Time; the Author, after Thirty Years Residence in these Colonies, and C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">espondence with some inquisitive Gentlemen of the several Governments, does generously offer to the Publick, the following Collection, done with some Ex|pence of Time borrowed from the Business of his Profes|sion, and Hours of Relaxation; without any mercenary, sordid, scribbling View of Profit, or Ostentation of more Knowledge in these Things than some of his Neighbours, but to contribute towards a solid certain Foundation for the Histories of these Countries in Times to come. The People in <HI>Europe</HI> (the publick Boards not excepted) have a very indistinct Notion of these Settlements, and the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Settlers are too indolent, to acquaint themselves with the State of their neighbouring Colonies.</P>
<P>Descriptions and bare Relations, although accurate and instructive, to many Readers are insipid and tedious; therefore a little Seasoning is sometimes used; where a <HI>mica Salis</HI> occurs, may it not be disagreeable, it is not designed with any malicious invidious View.

<HEAD>SECT. I. Concerning the Boundaries, between the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Settlements in <HI>NORTH-AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS a Treaty of Peace seems to be upon the Anvil in <HI>Europe</HI> between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI>; the Sub|ject-Matter of this Section, is to propose a Scheme (the more Proposals or Projections, the more Choice) to|wards determining and settling the Territorial Limits, and of an exclusive Indian Trade, between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> in <HI>North-America.</HI> The Scheme must be short, else it will not be attended to, and therefore requires some previous Elucidations, and some short anticipating Ac|counts of Things.</P>
<P>Our principal Interest is to rival the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in their Trade and Navigation, without Distinction or Partiality to either. In this present War, the <HI>French</HI> Court seem to neglect their Colonies, Trade and Naviga|tion, the principal Care of their late good and great Mi|nister Cardinal <HI>de Fleury</HI>; and do run into their former Romantick Humour of Land-Conquests. This is the Opportunity to take the Advantage of their Inattention, more especially with Regard to <HI>North America,</HI> our present Subject.</P>
<P>The FRENCH are the common Nusance and Disturbers of <HI>Europe,</HI> and will in a short Time become the same in <HI>America,</HI> if not mutilated at Home, and in <HI>America</HI> fenced off from us by Ditches and Walls, that is, by great Ri|vers and impracticable Mountains. They are a numerous&punc; powerful, rich and polite Nation, they have the Advan|tage of us in three grand Articles.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="006307_0010_0F652D624F392FB0">1. <HI>Their Government is absolutely Monarchical</HI>; Tax at Pleasure; not accountable for Monies expended in secret Services (in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Article for secret Services in the Civil List, is small, and when the Parliament allows any Sum extraordinary for that Use, it occasions a Grum|bling both within and without Doors) in this they have the Advantage of us, well knowing that not only private Persons, but Ministers of State, Generals, Admirals, even Sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be bought or brib'd; the late E. of <HI>Or&mdash;d</HI> the grand Master of Corruption, when he gave himself the Loose, at Times declared,
<Q>That there was no private Person or Community, but what might be corrupted, provided their Price could be complied with.</Q>
It therefore becomes the Representatives of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> narrowly to inspect into the Conduct of their Ministers, and other great Officers in Trust, especially in making Treaties with <HI>France</HI>; the infamous Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> 1713, was procured by the <HI>French</HI> Court bribing our cor|rupted Administration, that Part of it relating to the <HI>Bri|tish Northern American Colonies,</HI> will in Time be their Ruin, if not rectified and explained. 2. <HI>By Custom Time out of Mind, they are above, and do upon all Occasions dispense with the Principles of Honesty and Honour</HI>; Supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iority and Power is their only Rule, as LOUIS XIV. modestly expressed it&punc; in the Device upon his Cannon, <HI>Ratio ultima Regum</HI>: They occasionally make <HI>Dupes</HI> of the other Princes in <HI>Eu|rope</HI>; their Promises and Faith are by them used only as a Sort of Scaffolding, which, when the Structure is finish|ed, or Project effected, they drop; in all publick Trea|ties they are <HI>Gens de mauvaise Foy.</HI> This may seem an unmannerly national Reflection; but at this Time it could not be avoided, considering their perfidiously exciting a Rebellion in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> contrary to their solemn Ac|knowledgment and Guarantee of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, by inciting the Highlanders to Rapine and killing of their Countrymen; their re-fortifying of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in Time of Peace; their violating of their Guarantee of the <HI>Pragma|tick Sanction,</HI> concerning the Austrian Succession, by Inva|sion

of <HI>Germany.</HI> 3.

<P>In the Revolution of Ages, the several Countries upon the Earth have been depopulated by Pestilence, Famine or Wars; and afterwards settled from other Countries; thus the Origin of the several Countries must be very various and uncertain.

<P>IT is said, That one great Inducement to <HI>Columbus</HI>'s Adventure Westward, was to try for a Western Na|vigation to the <HI>Spice Islands</HI>; and luckily, by Islands and a great Continent intercepting him, <HI>America</HI> was discovered.</P>
<P>As the several great Continents of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> Eastward, and <HI>America</HI> Westward lay in the Way; the Case was, how to double the extreme North or South Points or Lands-Ends of these Continents; or to find some pr c|ticable
<PB N="26" REF="006307_0033_0F652D76A883DF38">
Straits or Thorough-Fares in these Continents.</P>
<P>Before we proceed, we shall insert by way of Amuse|ment, as not impertinent to the Subject, the following Digression.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Dutch</HI> Fishers missing of Whales, are said to have sailed in Quest of them, several Degrees North of <HI>Cape Purchas</HI> of <HI>East Greenland,</HI> which lies in N. Lat. 82 d; there was no Ice, only an open Sea, but very hollow. Whalers say, that the further North, on <HI>Spitsbergen,</HI> or <HI>East Greenland,</HI> they found the greater Plenty of Grass, and other green Herbs; therefore towards the <HI>Pole</HI> it must be hotter: This seems to be probable from the Na|ture of Things: In <HI>Iune</HI> at the <HI>North Pole</HI> the Sun is 23 d. 30 m. high, and for some Months always above the Horizon; whereas, for Instance, at <HI>London,</HI> the Me|tropolis of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in N. Lat. 51 d. 30 m. the Sun in <HI>December</HI> is only about 15 d. high, and only for one Third of its Revolution or Day, above the Horizon.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Frazier,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Navigator, says, in the Account of his South-Sea Voyages; that on the 13th of <HI>March</HI> 1714, N. S. in returning to <HI>France,</HI> South of <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> in Lat. 58 d. 30 m. and 68 d. 30 m. W. Longitude from <HI>Paris,</HI> he discovered several Islands of Ice, whereof one was four or five Leagues long; Ice is not frequently met with hereabouts, and as Ice is formed by an Adherence to some Land or Shore, there must be Land towards the <HI>South Pole</HI>; but not within 63 d. S. Lat. for the Extent of about 200 Leagues from 55 d. to 80 d. West Long. from <HI>Paris</HI>; because this Space has been run by several Ships, which the S. W. and S. S. W. Winds have oblig|ed to stand far to the Southward, to weather <HI>Cape-Horn,</HI> the Lands-End of <HI>South-America,</HI> in 55 d. 55 m. S. Lat. This is the Reason, why that Chimera or Fancy of a <HI>Terra Australis</HI> is at present left out of our Charts or Maps. If Lands are discovered South of 64 d. S. Lat. they must be inhospitable and uninhabitable, considering that the Weather is more stormy, and Winters more rigid, in the high South Latitudes, than in the same Northern Lati|tudes;
<PB N="27" REF="006307_0034_0F652D774DB60E38">
the same Climates South of the <HI>Equator,</HI> are much colder than to the Northward of the <HI>Equator.</HI></P>
<P>The Southern Latitudes are much colder, than in the same Degrees of Northern Latitudes. 1. The Sun is annually eight Days longer on the Northern Side of the Equinoctial than on its Southern Side. 2. The Sun in our North Country Winters is in <HI>Perigee,</HI> that is, nearer the Earth, than in the Southern Winters, being then in his <HI>Apogee.</HI> 3. The highest Cod-Fishery according to Capt. <HI>Frazier,</HI> in the Southern Latitudes is in 31 d. S. Lat; our Cod Fishery in <HI>North-America</HI> (there are some stragling Cod-Fish caught more to the Southward) extends to <HI>Nan|tucket New-England</HI> in 41 d. N. Lat: Therefore 41 d. N. Lat. is nearly of the same Temper or Coolness as 31 d. S. Lat.</P>
<P>To obtain navigable Passages, into the Indian and South Seas, the extreme North and South Promontories or Lands-Ends of the several Continents above-mention|ed, were to be doubled. They are reduceable to four, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. The S. E. Passage by doubling the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> the South Point of <HI>Africa.</HI> 2. The S. W. Pas|sage by doubling <HI>Cape Horn</HI> the South Point of <HI>America, Megallan</HI>'s Streights is a Thorough-Fare. 3. The N. E. Passage, North of the North Cape of <HI>Europe,</HI> but hither|to not discovered. 4 The N. W. Passage, or rather Thorough-Fare between the North Shore of <HI>America,</HI> and the South Shore of <HI>West-Greenland,</HI> commonly called <HI>Da|vis</HI>'s Streights (to double the North Parts of this <HI>West-Greenland,</HI> has hitherto not been imagined) this has at Times been endeavoured in the last Century and half, M. <HI>Dobbs</HI> is at present, in Pursuit of it. Lastly, We shall men|tion some Tentatives for discovering Thorough-Fares in several Openings in the Body of the Continentof <HI>America.</HI></P>

This Way of Reasoning does not hold good in the high Southern Latitudes, where from this Doctrine the Winds ought to be S. W, whereas they are in a Manner fixed at N.

<P>The South-Sea Company have tried three Methods of carrying on their <HI>Negro</HI> Business, viz. by their own Ships, by Contract, and by Chance purchase from pri|vate Traders, this last was the cheapest: Anno 1721 they contracted with the <HI>African</HI> Company for a Supply of 3600 Negroes, two Thirds Males, Six Sevenths to be from 16 to 30 Aet. the other Seventh to consist of equal Numbers of Boys and Girls, none under 10 Aet. the contracted Price was 22 &pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> Sterl. per Piece for Gold Coast, <HI>Iackin,</HI> and <HI>Whidaw</HI> Negroes; 18 &pound;. 10 <HI>s.</HI> Sterl. for <HI>Angola</HI> Slaves.

<P>Never was such a barefaced iniquitous Scheme endeavoured to be put in Execution; their Confidence was in the legislative Power, which they imagined, could do any Thing, though inconsistent with natural Justice. The Subject of this Annotation, will remain a cu|rious Incident in History. That a private Person Mr. <HI>Law,</HI> Pro|jector of the MISSISIPPI Company Bubble (this Name appear'd too chimerical, it afterwards assumed and still retains the Name of the <HI>French India Company</HI>) should so infatuate, impose upon, or bubble, in a most publick Manner, the politer Part of Mankind; future Ages will be astonished, scarce credit, but admire. He rose the Stock of a Chimerical Company from 60 to 70 per Cent. discount (their first Stock or Subscription was 60 Millions of Livres in State Bills, or national Debts settled at 60 or 70 per Cent. discount) to 19 Hundred per Cent. advance.</P>
<P>By adding to this 60 Million Subscription in State Bills, 40 Mil|lions more, Money Subscription; their Stock became one Hundred Millions, and by the King's assigning to them the Farm upon To|bacco which then was farmed at 4 Millions with the Farmer's Profit, computed to 3 Millions more, made 7 per Cent. to the Proprietors: This gave them a great Credit, and their Stock rose much above Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; next, the <HI>East-India</HI> and <HI>China</HI> Company was incorporated with it, Anno 1718, and Actions rose to 200 for 100 original. By seven successive Subscriptions of 60, 40, 25, 25, 50, 50, 50 Millions, it became in all 300,000,000 Livres Principal or Original Stock.

<P>In Sept. 1719, the Subscriptions (as above) taken in for increasing their Stock were at 10 for 1, and those Subscriptions were negociat|ed at Cent per Cent, that is 1 Principal sold for 20, the Subscription<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were to be made good by partial Payments: But as many of the Subscribers could not make their subsequent Parts of Payments, with|out selling out their former Stock; old Actions fell to 760 for 100, (notwithstanding of this precedent Warning, our <HI>South-Sea Bubble</HI> split upon the very same Rock) but by enlarging the Times for the Subscription Payments, and the Interest of their Loans to the Crown being augmented, Stock rose again to 1200 or 1300, their Privileges being continued to <HI>Anno</HI> 1770.</P>
<P>The Money which the Company gained by the advanced Prices upon the several Additions from Time to Time made to their Stock was lent to the King at a certain Interest; with this Money the King paid off or reduced the State Debts or Annuities in the Town-House of <HI>Paris,</HI> from 4 to 3 per Cent Interest; which was a Saving of about 12 Millions per Annum to the King.</P>
<P>In January N. S. 1720 the King had granted to the <HI>Missisippi</HI> alias <HI>India</HI> Company, the Management and Administration of the Royal Bank.

<P>This grand national Cheat, became a Parliamentary Enquiry. In the Report of the secret Committee, forty Members of the House of Commons were charged with having Stock taken up for them in Broker's Names; it was found that the Directors bought Stock for the Com|pany at very high Rates, while they were clandestinely selling out their own; that the Directors had lent out by Collusion, about Eleven Millions of the Company's Money, with none or not sufficient Security. In the House of Lords, the whole of it was called a villanous Artifice; and it was resolved in Parliament, that the Directors so far as their Estates would reach, should make good the Losses the Company had sustained by their fraudulent Management; the Estates of the Directors Deputy Cashier, and Accountant amounted to 2,014,123 &pound;. Sterl. properly forfeited, but by Management a great Part of it was remitted to them: The Reliefs allowed by Parliament is too long to be related here; to the Company was forgiven the Seven Million which they contracted to pay to the Government, upon Condition of two Millions of their Capital being annihilated, but this was soon after restored to them.

<P>The Reason why <HI>New-England</HI> dry Cod is frequently Salt burnt, is from the Use of <HI>Tortuga</HI> and <HI>Isle of May</HI> Salt, which are too hot. In <HI>Newfoundland</HI> they gene|rally use <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Salt.</P>
<P>By late Acts of the British Parliament; Salt is al|lowed to be imported directly from any Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the Colonies of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Pensylvania</HI>; in the same Manner as Salt may be imported into <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> by an Act made 15 <HI>Car.</HI> II. for the Encouragement of Trade.</P>

<PB N="110" REF="006307_0117_0F652DBE16718F48">
Researches until 25 Aet. the Air of the Soil and juvenile Conversation do not much contribute towards this: Therefore a Person not a Native, but not a Foreigner, who comes into any Country at that Age, and enters upon and prosecutes such Investigations from personal Obser|vations, and credible Correspondencies for a Course of thirty Years, may be said, as if born in the Country. I hope Criticks, Natives of any of these our Colonies, will not reckon it a Presumption in me to essay the following Accounts; especially as at present, no Native appears to undertake this laborious but useful Performance; I ac|knowledge it to be a Performance not of Genius, but of Labour, and Method to render it distinct and clear.</P>
<P>The <HI>American</HI> Colonies can not be claimed by the se|veral <HI>European</HI> Nations from Preocupancy (they were not Derelicts but in Possession of the aboriginal <HI>Indians</HI>) nor by Inheritance, nor by what the Law of Nature and Na|tions deem a justifiable Conquest; therefore the adventu|ring <HI>European</HI> Powers, could only give to some of their particular Subjects, an exclusive Grant of negociating and purchasing from the natural Proprietors the native <HI>Indians,</HI> and thereupon a Power of Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Formerly Priority of Discovery, even without a con|tinued Occupancy or Possession was deem'd a good Claim: Thus we originate our Claims in <HI>North America</HI> from the <HI>Cabots</HI> coasting from <HI>Prima Vista</HI> in 66 d. to 34 d. N. Lat. although for near a Century following, we made no Settlements there, and did not so much as navigate the Coast; because <HI>Henry</HI> VIII was a vicious Prince, the Af|fairs of his Wives and Perplexities with the Church gave him full Employment; <HI>Edward</HI> VI was a Minor; Q. <HI>Mary</HI> a wicked Woman and bigotted <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> her sole Attention was to re-establish <HI>Popery,</HI> at that Time wearing out of Fashion, in a most inhumane, execrable, furious, zealous Manner; good Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a great Encourager of Trade and Navigation in some Respects, but had the distressing of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and Protection of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> more in her Intentions, than the making of

and Associates, for discovering and planting Lands in <HI>North-America,</HI> not actually possessed by any Christian Prince: That same Year two small Vessels were sent via <HI>Canaries</HI> and the <HI>Caribee-Islands</HI> (this, in these Days was reckoned the only Rout of Navigation for any Part of <HI>America</HI>) to trade upon that Coast, upon their Return, in Honour to the Virgin Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was called <HI>Virginia,</HI> reaching so far North as the Gulph of <HI>St. Lau|rence.</HI> Anno 1585 Sir <HI>Walter</HI> sent Sir <HI>Richard Greenville</HI> with several Vessels and 108 People to begin a Plantation; they landed upon the Island <HI>Roanoke</HI> near the Mouth of <HI>Albemarle</HI> River in <HI>North-Carolina.</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> from the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> by Way of the Gulph of <HI>Florida</HI> Stream, touched in at <HI>Roanoke</HI> Anno 1586, these People Settlers dissatisfied, most of them returned with him to <HI>England.</HI> Anno 1587 and 1589 Mr. <HI>White</HI> with the Character of Governor, brought over some People to <HI>Cape-Hatteras,</HI> but effected no Settlement.</P>
<P>No further Attempt worth mentioning, was made un|til <HI>Anno</HI> 1606, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> by his Attainder having forfeited his Patent, several Adventurers petitioned the King for Grants, and a Grant was made to two Companies, in one Charter, <HI>viz.</HI> to the <HI>London</HI> Adventurers from 34 d. to 41 d.

<P>Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> in his Chronology of ancient Kingdoms amended, by his incomparable Sagacity investigates, that in ancient Times <HI>Greece</HI> and all <HI>Europe</HI> were peopled by wandring <HI>Cimerians</HI> and <HI>Scy|thians</HI>; the Emigrations or Excursions which in several Ages have occasioned Revolutions and new peopling of the Southern Parts of <HI>Europe; Goths, Vandals,</HI> &amp;c. came from thence by swarming, that is leaving their native Country for Want of Room or Subsistance, Nor|thern Countries are the least liable to the above-mentioned Calamities, and may be called Nurseries: they had lived a rambling Life, like the <HI>Tartars</HI> in the Northern Parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>We should have previously observed, That Mankind is naturally a gregarious Animal, does not love Solitude, but has a strong Passion or Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nsity for Society; their natural Reason, and Capacity of Speech or Communication of Thoughts, inclines them to it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> from him most of our modern Historians of this Kind transcribe, gives a very easy novel Manner of the peopling the several Nations from the Posterity of <HI>Noah</HI>; we shall not impose this upon our Readers: He says the <HI>Americans</HI> proceeded from <HI>Noah,</HI> by Way of <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>Others publish their Conjectures, that <HI>North-America</HI> was peopled from <HI>Scythia</HI> and <HI>Tartary</HI>; that <HI>South-America</HI> was peopled from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Iapan,</HI> without reflecting, that according to the Situation of these Countries it is impracticable; our modern large Ships can|not perform the Navigation from <HI>China,</HI> in less than 6 or 7 Months: How can it be performed in Canoes? The <HI>Americans</HI> had no large Embarkations, this requires no serious Animadversions.</P>

<P><PB N="153" REF="006307_0160_0F652DE4D6BB8CB0">The Boundaries of their united Tribes, called Nations or Empires, are natural, viz.

<P>The Tribes which, at least nominally, compose their general Denomination of a Nation, are generally named from the Rivers upon which they live; as in <HI>Lapland</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the <HI>Laplanders</HI> are distinguished by the Names of the Rivers <HI>Uma, Pitha, Lula, Torneo,</HI> and <HI>Kimi.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>China</HI> seems to be the elder Brother of all the Na|tions of Mankind as to their <HI>Politia</HI> and Improvements in Nature; so <HI>America</HI> may with much Propriety be called the youngest Brother and meanest of Mankind; no Civil Government, no Religion, no Letters&punc; the <HI>French</HI> call them <HI>Les Hommes des Bois,</HI> or Men-Brutes of the Forrest: They do not cultivate the Earth by plant|ing or grazing: Excepting a very inconsiderable Quan|tity of <HI>Mays</HI> or <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> and of <HI>Kidney-Beans</HI> (in <HI>New England</HI> they are called <HI>Indian Beans</HI>) which some of their <HI>Squaas</HI> or Women plant; they do not provide

for To-Morrow, their Hunting is their necessary Sub|sistence not Diversion; when they have good Luck in Hunting, they eat and sleep until all is consumed and then go a Hunting again.</P>
<P>The higher the Latitudes, the <HI>Indians</HI> are fewer in Numbers and more straggling, Nature not affording ne|cessary Subsistence for many, and only in small Bodies or Herds: Their Trade or Commerce is trifling, having no Produce, no Manufacture, but little Game; the Difficulty of subsisting requires almost their whole Time to provide for themselves.</P>
<P>Excepting that Constitution of Body, which by Use they have acquired from their Birth, of enduring Hard|ships of Hunger and Weather; they are tender, and not long-lived, and generally very simple and ignorant, some of their old Men by Use and Experience in the World, acquire a considerable Degree of Sagacity. New Negroes from <HI>Guinea</HI> generally exceed them much in Constitution of Body and Mind. In the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay New-England,</HI> there was formerly a very good Project or Design, to educate at College, some of their most promising Youths, to serve as <HI>Mis|sionaries</HI> for civilizing, instructing and converting of the wild <HI>Indians</HI>: This good Purpose turn'd abortive from the Tenderness of their Constitution and Aukwardness in Learning, and at present is laid aside.</P>
<P>They are not so polite as the wandring <HI>Tartars,</HI> no Dairys. Like the <HI>wild Irish</HI> they dread Labour more than Poverty, like Dogs they are always either eating or sleeping, excepting in Travelling, Hunting, and their Dances; their Sloth and Indolence inclines them to Sottishness; before Christians arrived amongst them, they had no Knowledge of strong Drink; this Chri|stian Vice not only destroys their bodily Health, and that of their Progeny, but creates Feuds, Outrages, and horrid Murders. They are much given to Deceit and Lying, so as scarce to be believed when they speak Truth. See <HI>Annotations</HI> Page 116. Their Temper is

the Reverse of the <HI>East Indians,</HI> whereof some Casts or Sects will not kill any Animal; the <HI>West Indians</HI> or <HI>Americans</HI> are barbarous, and upon small Provocations kill their own Species; some of them exceed in Bar|barity, and in Revenge and Fury eat the Flesh of their Enemies, not from Hunger or Delicacy; such formerly were the <HI>Florida Indians,</HI> they said that the Flesh of the <HI>English</HI> eat mellow and tender, that of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> hard and tough, the <HI>Bermudian</HI> fishy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aboriginal Americans</HI> have no Honesty, no Ho|nour, that is, they are of no Faith, but meer Brutes in that Respect. They generally have great Fortitude of Mind; without any Appearance of Fear or Concern, they suffer any Torture and Death. In Revenge they are barbarous and implacable; they never forget nor forgive Injuries; if one Man kills another, the nearest in Kindred to the murdered, watches an Opportunity to kill the Murderer; and the Death of one Man may occasion the Deaths of many; therefore when a Man is guilty of Murder, he generally leaves the Tribe, and goes into a voluntary Kind of Banishment. They are a sullen close People. The <HI>Indian Wars</HI> ought to be called <HI>Massacres,</HI> or inhumane barbarous Out-rages, rather than necessary Acts of Hostility.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> have their Hunting, Fowling and Fish|ing Grounds, by a forked pointed Pole, they strike or harpoon their Fish; but their Wives and Children reside mostly on their planting Grounds, they plant but little. They do not wander like the <HI>Tartars</HI>; there are said to be some wandering <HI>Indians,</HI> they cannot be many; because the settling <HI>Indians</HI> are very jealous of their hunting and fishing Grounds or Properties.</P>
<P>Their ancient Navigation was only crossing of Rivers upon <HI>Bark-logs,</HI> travelling along Rivers, Rivulets and Sides of Lakes in <HI>Canoes</HI> or <HI>Schuyties,</HI> portable by two Men in their Carrying-Places from one River or Pond to another, they are of Birch-Bark upon Ribs of Ash, sow'd together by some tough wooden Fibres, and

Be|tween the <HI>Tropicks</HI> they reckon by Rains (the Seasons of Rains, End of Summer and Beginning of Autumn are <HI>periodical,</HI> as are our Winters) Moons and Sleeps. In computing Distances, they reckon by Sleeps or Days Travel (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do by Hours) <HI>viz.</HI> so many Sleeps or Days Travel from one Place to another.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding of the Unpoliteness and Want of Fire-Arms amongst the <HI>American Aboriginals,</HI> the <HI>Euro|peans</HI> could not have effected their Settlements because of vast Disparity in Numbers; if some disaffected Tribes, to be revenged of the Impositions and Encroach|ments of some neighbouring Tribes, had not joined the <HI>European</HI> Small-Arms; thus <HI>Cortez</HI> against <HI>Mexico</HI> was

<P><HI>As to their Make and Complexion.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We cannot account for the aboriginal Differences of Complex|ions in the various Nations, and the Variety of their Features. The People of the middle and South Parts of <HI>Africa</HI> are Black, of various constant permanent Shades or Degrees, with flat Noses, thick Lips, short frizled or crisp black Hair; perhaps the Complexion of the tawney Moor of <HI>Barbary</HI> the ancient <HI>Mauritania,</HI> is not aboriginal, but a Complication of the <HI>European</HI> White and the <HI>African</HI> Black; our <HI>American</HI> Complexion seems to be native and sincere. The Na|tives of the <HI>Indian</HI> Peninsula, betwixt the Rivers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nges</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> have the <HI>African</HI> black Complexion, the <HI>Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> Features, and the <HI>American</HI> lank black Hair or <HI>Crin,</HI> but all native and genuine, not from a mixed Breed. Extreme hot or extreme cold Weather, do equally tawn white People but not permanently; Transplantation or Transportation recovers their native Com|plexion.</P>
<P>It is not various Climates that gives the various Complexions&punc; <HI>America</HI> lies from 65 d. N. Lat. to 55 d. S. Lat. comprehending all the various Climates of <HI>Europe, Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI>; the <HI>American</HI> Complexion is permanently every where the same; only with a more or less of the metaline Lusture. <HI>Salmon,</HI> a late disaffected Scribler, in his Modern History; says, the Blacks after some Ge|nerations will become white; in <HI>New-England</HI> there are <HI>Guinea</HI> Slaves in Succession of several Generations, they continue the same in Feature and Complexion; it is true, that in the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands some dissolute Planters are said to wash the Blackemore white, by generat|ing with the Successive Shades of their own Issue, Children, Grand Children, &amp;c. the Progeny at Length becomes <HI>blonde,</HI> or of a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> White.</P>
<P>Upon this Subject there are several Intricacies in Nature not to be un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avelled. Why the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Guinea</HI> should have woolly crisp black Hair, and those of the <HI>Indian</HI> Peninsula have lank black Hair? Why the Wool of Northern Sheep carried into a hot Cli|mate becomes like Goats Hair, and returned to a Northern Climate, they recover their Wool again?

Their Com|plexion is of a splendid redish Brown, or metaline Lustre, which is well expressed by a Copper Colour; thus a splendid White, is called Silver Colour: Not of an Olive-Colour or tawney (a tanned Leather yellowish Colour) as are the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and some of their Progeny in the South Parts of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> Some <HI>Indians</HI> upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> are of a milk-white Complexion, which is not natural and hereditary; but proceeds from a tender morbid Constitution, their Parents were copper-coloured, and their Children become copper-coloured.</P>

<P>Our general Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> is Fire-Arms, Powder, and Shot for War and Hunting; Strouds and Blankets for Cloathing; Spirits, Rum and Brandy for Indolence; formerly Toys, which were as considerable though silly Amusement to them, as Jewels are to us.</P>
<P>In Travelling they direct their Course by noted Mountains, by the Sun when visible, by the mossy or North side of Trees. As most Insects avoid Oils, the <HI>Indians</HI> grease themselves as a Defence against <HI>Muskitoes</HI> and other troublesom Flies.</P>

<P>Some <HI>Indians</HI> of Sagacity, a little civilized and in|structed towards the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> can give no dis|tinct Account of any <HI>Indian Religion,</HI> and do stumble much at the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of our <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> being indiscreetly crouded upon them at once, and with too much Impetuosity, without previous Instruction, if you do not <HI>believe immediately,</HI> you will be <HI>damned,</HI> is the Expression of our <HI>Zealots</HI>; whereas they ought to be first tamed by Familiarity and fair Dealing, in friendly Conversation u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on proper Occasions, without any Ap|pearance of Officiousness, ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruct them in <HI>natural Re|ligion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> these are plain and easily compre|hended; afterwards with Discretion, they may be by de|grees initiated into the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of our <HI>Religion</HI>: Our <HI>Missionaries,</HI> void of common Prudence, in a reverse pre|posterous Manner begin with the <HI>abstruse Articles</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and thence proceed to instruct them in the plain easy Dictates of Nature.

<HEAD>A Digression concerning the <HI>Religions</HI> of ancient Nations.</HEAD>
<P>I do not presume to write concerning the controver|sial or devotional Points of our modern Religions, na|tional, or private Opinions; that is the Business of a peculiar Profession or <HI>Craft,</HI> called <HI>Priests.</HI></P>
<P>Religion improves in Nations, Hand in Hand with good Policy, and as they become more and more civi|lized. It may be called the <HI>Cement of Society.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> did fight <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> for their Religion, as well as for their Country. Amongst the <HI>West India Bu|caneers</HI> the most morally vicious of Mankind; the <HI>French</HI> immovably adhered to one another because of their being all <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> to one ano|ther as being <HI>Protestants,</HI> and not from any other Regard. Otherways both agreed and acted jointly as Pirates.</P>
<P>As to Religion, all Mankind may be divided into three Sects.</P>
<P N="1">I. They who believe in a supreme Intelligence (or Intelligences) who by Omnipotence created and framed the World, and by infinite Wisdom manages it: They may be called the <HI>Godly.</HI> With this Class, the divine Attribute INCOMPREHENSIBLE ought to resolve and compose all Altercations concerning this <HI>Being: Plutarch</HI> says, there is but One and the same <HI>supreme Being</HI> or Providence, that governs the World, though worship|ed by Multiplicity of Names, by various Nations and Sectaries. This Sect admits of three Sub-divisions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Theists,</HI> commonly called <HI>Deists,</HI> who admit of no Modifications in the <HI>Deity</HI>; in ancient Times and to this Day, they are improperly called <HI>Atheists.</HI> Amongst us, he who denies the <HI>Trinity,</HI> is in Law deemed <HI>Atheist</HI> and <HI>Blas|phemer. Anaxagoras</HI> the Philosopher passed at <HI>Athens</HI> for an <HI>Atheist,</HI> because he denied that the Sun, the o|ther Planets and the Stars were Gods. <HI>Socrates</HI> is said to have been a <HI>Martyr</HI> for the Unity of the <HI>Godhead,</HI> refusing to pay Homage to the various Gods of <HI>Greece.</HI> This is the national (if we may thus express) Religion
<PB N="164" REF="006307_0171_0F652DED0F41EDF8">
of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> having the largest Extent of all national Religions. It is the private Opinion of many who are intermixed with and go by the Name of <HI>Chri|stians,</HI> and are generally designed <HI>Arians,</HI> or <HI>Socinians, (Socinus</HI> of <HI>Sienna</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>) they also deny <HI>Original Sin</HI> and <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Tritheists</HI> or <HI>Trinitarians.</HI> The distinguishing Te|net of all true Orthodox Christians: They worship Di|vinity under three distinct Modifications, which I shall not pretend to explain or illustrate, because a Mystery.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Polytheists.</HI> Such were the ancient <HI>Egyptians, Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans:</HI> The Poets had a greater Variety of Gods than the <HI>Philosophers,</HI> many of them to be looked upon as a Machinary introduced to embellish a Poem, and to amuse the Mind: They deified various Parts of Nature, and were great Promoters of <HI>Polytheism.</HI> All the Gods and Goddesses of the Ancients were only Mo|difications, Words or Names, to express several Attri|butes of a <HI>supreme Being,</HI> the Excellencies in Nature, and the Virtues of <HI>Heroes</HI> and very eminent Men; as if in <HI>Britain</HI> we should say NEWTON the God of Na|tural Philosophy and Mathematicks, ADDISON, the God of the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> and polite Learning.</P>
<P N="2">II. They who admit of no <HI>supreme Intelligence,</HI> but say that blind Matter is the Extent of our Knowledge&punc; these are the literal and true <HI>Atheists. Anaximander</HI> was the first noted <HI>Atheist</HI> upon Record, about 600 Years before CHRIST; his noted Followers were <HI>Lucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius</HI> &amp;c; in these late Times, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Spinosa</HI> a Jew in his <HI>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Iord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">no Bruno,</HI> wrote a Book, <HI>De tribus Impostoribus</HI>; meaning <HI>Moses, CHRIST,</HI> and <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hobb</HI>'s in his <HI>Leviathan,</HI> advanced several wild Notions of this Kind, but not consistent; he died <HI>An.</HI> 1679. Aet. 91.</P></NOTE> some singularly self-conceited of their own Penetration, have avowedly declared themselves such, in Despite of all the polite Part of Mankind.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="165" REF="006307_0172_0F652DEDE2BC9400">III. The third Sect made its first Appearance by Means of <HI>Pyrrho,</HI> in the 120 Olympiad, <HI>they doubted of every Thing. Cicero</HI> and <HI>Seneca</HI> two great Men were in|clined this Way; late D. of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> an ingenious Man, the Epitaph which he made for himself begins, <HI>Dubius vixi, incertus morior,</HI> &amp;c: Dr. <HI>B&mdash;ly</HI> B. of <HI>Cl&mdash;ue</HI> seems to affirm, in a whimsical Manner, that eve|ry Thing we see is an Illusion, that the whole Series of Life is a continued Dream.</P>
<P>To these we may add, that, There is with all sober|minded Men only one general Religion. THE PRAC|TICE OF TRUE AND SOLID VIRTUE. The Belief in certain Vague Opinions, the observing of fixed or ap|pointed external Rites and Ceremonies, do not enlighten the Understanding, or purify the Heart by rectifying the Passions. Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> in his Essay upon Man, well ex|presses it.</P>

<P>Let us investigate the <HI>Origin</HI> and <HI>Progress</HI> of Religion from the <HI>Nature of Things.</HI> Mankind is naturally a su|perstitious <HI>pavidum Animal,</HI> some few cunning designing Men, take the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps <HI>Priests</HI> of all Religions are the same, we must except a sober-minded, regular, truly pious and exemplary Clergy, they are of the greatest Use in cementing Society.</NOTE> Advantage of this general Weakness of humane Nature; and as Nurses do frighten and awe Children by Hobgoblins and Bugbears, so they by <HI>Voci|ferations, Gesticulations,</HI> and pretended Familiarity with some superior invisible Being, promise to conciliate his Benevolence, in procuring Good luck in their Affair of Life (thus <HI>Powowers</HI> promise Good-luck in Hunting to the <HI>Indians</HI>) they avert Sickness and other Calamities;

sometimes from the said Familiarity, they impose pre|tended <HI>Dreams, Visions</HI> and <HI>Impulses,</HI> as do our present <HI>New Light</HI> Disciples of a vagrant or strolling Actor of <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI> The <HI>Chinese,</HI> though a polite People, their Commonalty are much addicted to Superstition and Magick.</P>
<P>From this the Wisemen, that is the Lawgivers and Ministers of State in <HI>Greece</HI> and elsewhere took the Hint, and set up <HI>Oracles,</HI> which were absolutely under their own Direction and Influence, these were of good Use to reconcile the silly (but <HI>varium et mutabile vulgus</HI>) People, to what the State in Wisdom had proposed upon any extraordinary Occasions: These Oracles were deli|vered by Women; the <HI>Sybils</HI> were called <HI>Fatidicae,</HI> that is, <HI>prophecying</HI> and <HI>fortune-telling</HI> Women; our Women Exhorters among the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Methodists</HI> are not of the same good Use.</P>
<P><HI>Herodotus</HI> writes (<HI>Cicero</HI> calls him the Father of His|tory) that the ancient <HI>Persians</HI> had neither Temples, Altars nor Statues; in this Condition we found the <HI>Aboriginal Indians</HI> or <HI>Americans.</HI> When Nations began to be civilized, we find the first Objects of Adoration (proceeding from Admiration) were the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> other <HI>Planets,</HI> and the <HI>Stars,</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI>; and the Periods of their Revolutions were used in the Computation of Time. The Revolution of the <HI>Sun</HI> was called a <HI>Year,</HI> that of the <HI>Moon</HI> a <HI>Month</HI>; every <HI>Planet</HI> had one <HI>Day</HI> assigned him, and these <HI>seven planetary</HI> Days were called a <HI>Week:</HI> If there had been more or fewer Planets, the Days of the Week would have been more or fewer; <HI>Moses</HI> brought up in all the Learning of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> retained the same in his History-Part of our Bible, and carries on the Allegory (as some <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> call it) of the Creation accordingly. Our <HI>American Indians</HI> had no Knowledge of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and therefore had no Reckonings by Weeks or Returns of seven Days. The planetary Names of the Days of the Week, at first View, seem confused and at Random; but in Fact
<PB N="167" REF="006307_0174_0F652DEF5110D5E0">
they were methodically so called: They began by the <HI>Sun</HI> as being the most glorious <HI>Planet,</HI> and assigned to him the first Day of the Week, <HI>Dies Solis</HI> or <HI>Sunday</HI> (Sab|bath-day is of a <HI>Iewish</HI> Signification and properly the Seventh Day of the Week, <HI>Lord's Day</HI> is novel and peculiar to Christians) from thence reckoning in the na|tural Order of the <HI>Planets,</HI> allowing a Planet to every Hour of the 24 which compose a Day, the next in Course according to the Astronomy of these Days was <HI>Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Iupiter, Mars,</HI> and con|sequently the <HI>Sun</HI> had the eighth Hour, the fifteenth and twenty-second Hour, <HI>Venus</HI> the twenty-third, <HI>Mer|cury</HI> the twenty-fourth, consequently the <HI>Moon</HI> had the first Hour of the next Parcel of 24 Hours, and gave Name to the second Day of the Week, <HI>Dies Lunae</HI> or Monday; and in the same Rotation <HI>Mercury</HI> gives Name to the third, <HI>Iupiter</HI> to the fourth Day of the Week, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In <HI>Britain</HI> we have substituted four of our North-Country or Gothick Gods in Place of <HI>Mercury, Mars, Iupiter,</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>So far back as ancient Records do inform, we find that amongst the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Orientals,</HI> Religion first began to acquire a national Consistence or System. The <HI>Philosophers</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> went to <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> to study Wisdom, Learning, and Religion; those of <HI>Rome</HI> went to <HI>Greece</HI>: They all did so much indulge a poe|tical or mythological Vein, that it is difficult to distinguish between their true established Religion and Gods, from the Fabulous.</P>
<P>The various Religions at this Time amongst the Na|tions of this Earth (the several Parts of the Earth that can be of any Consequence, are now well explored, and the <HI>Americans</HI> may be well said to be of no Religion) may be reduced to these general Heads. 1. The <HI>Chri|stian,</HI> or Believers in <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> which perhaps is that of <HI>Moses</HI> with Additions and Emendations; this may be called the <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> some few <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe</HI> excepted. 2. The <HI>Mahometan,</HI>

<P>The <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> have a Kind of Religion, which may be called <HI>Idolatry</HI>; they worship some ma|terial Objects, which in their Nature may be extremely beneficial or very hurtful to Mankind, the first through Admiration and Love, the other through Fear: but our stupid <HI>America Indians</HI> had no Temples, no Altars, no Idols or Images, no set Times for Worship, if it may be called Worship, it is only occasional with fran|tick and ridiculous Vociferations and Gesticulations, in Cases of Sickness or great Calamities, performed by some of their cunning Men called <HI>Powowers</HI>: They never harrass <HI>European</HI> Captives to change their Reli|gion; no religious Wars, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The civil Administration in <HI>England,</HI> from Experience are sensi|ble of the Inconveniences arising from the Meetings of the Convocati|ons of the Clergy, and for many Years have not allowed them to fit: They are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssential to Episcopal Church Government, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n they meet, they naturally ferment or rather effer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esce, and occasion feverish Paroxysms in the Church, and sometimes Convulsions in the State.</NOTE> no Confusions from Convo|cations.</P>

In numbering they use the same natural Way of reckoning by Tens, as in <HI>Europe,</HI> Ten being the Number of humane Fin|gers.

"At <HI>Taunton</HI> by the Side of a tiding River, Part in, Part out of the River there is a large Rock, on the perpendicular Side of which, next to the Stream, are 7 or 8 Lines, about 7 or 8 Feet long, and about a Foot wide each of them, ingraven with unaccountable Characters, not like any known Character."

<P>As the <HI>Indians</HI> were so rude, as to have no Letters or other Characters, there is no certain Way of writing their Names of Things; all we can do is to express their Sounds or Pronunciations as near as may be in our own Letters.

Here we may observe that our <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> in this pending War have not annoyed our Settlements Eastward, being called off by the <HI>French</HI> to <HI>Crown-Point</HI>; from <HI>Crown-Point</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> have done considerable Damage upon the <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Western Frontiers; and to <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> by investing of the Fort of <HI>Annapo|lis-Royal,</HI> and by the Massacre of our People at <HI>Menis,</HI> they have considerably incommoded us.

<P>GOVERNOR DUMMER'S WAR against the <HI>Indians</HI> may be reckoned purely <HI>Indian,</HI> we shall give some short Ac|count of it. The <HI>Canada French</HI> perceiving our Eastern Settlements advance apace, set their <HI>Quenebec</HI> Missionary Father <HI>Ralle</HI> a Jesuite to Work; he made these <HI>Indians</HI> jealous of the <HI>English</HI> by telling them, that these Lands were given by GOD unalienably to the <HI>Indians</HI> and their Children for ever, according to the Christian sacred Ora|cles. Anno 1717 The <HI>Indians</HI> began to murmur, and after some Time gave the <HI>English</HI> Settlers formal Warn|ing to leave the Lands within a set Time, at the Expi|ration of the Time they committed Depredations by de|stroying their Cattle and other Stock:
The Missionary, with a Priestly Heat began the Affair too precipitately, before the receiving of Directions from <HI>France,</HI> as appears by a Letter from M. <HI>Vandreuil</HI> Governor-General of <HI>Ca|nada</HI> to this Father "he could not tell, how far he might intermeddle in the Affair, until he had particular Instruc|tions from the Council of the Navy in <HI>France</HI>;" all the <HI>French</HI> Colonies are under the Direction of that Board:
And the Small-Pox (which the <HI>Indians</HI> with good Rea|son dread) prevailing in <HI>New-England, Anno</HI> 1721, pre|vented a declared Rupture until <HI>Anno</HI> 1722. <HI>Iuly</HI> 5. the Government of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> proclaimed them Re|bels, and ordered 100 &pound;. per Scalp to Voluntiers fitted out at their own Charge, and afterwards 4 <HI>s.</HI> per Day be|sides: Our most considerable Action against them was at <HI>Noridgwoag</HI> of <HI>Quenebec</HI> River <HI>August</HI> 12. Anno 1724, their fighting Men being just come Home from Scout|ing; Capt. <HI>Harman</HI> with 200 Men in 17 Whale-Boats go up <HI>Quenebec</HI> River, surprize the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Naridgwog,</HI> bring off 26 <HI>Indian</HI> Scalps, and that of Father <HI>Ralle; Indians</HI> kill'd, and drowned in their Flight cross the River, were computed to be Eighty: Capt. <HI>Lovel</HI> a Voluntier, with 44 Men sets out, via <HI>Ossipy</HI> Pond, for <HI>Pigocket</HI>&punc; was intercepted by about 70 <HI>Indians,</HI> he

and about 14 of his Men were killed, and many wound|ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> were concern'd in this War, they made a vain Assault upon the Fort of <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and did some Damage at <HI>Canso.</HI></P>
<P>The Delegates from the 5 or 6 <HI>New-York Indian</HI> Na|tions, and from the <HI>Mohegin</HI> or <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River <HI>Indians,</HI> and from the <HI>Scatacooks,</HI> came to <HI>Boston,</HI> received Pre|sents, gave fair Promises of acting in our Favour, but did nothing.</P>
<P>We sent Commissioners to the Governor-General of <HI>Canada,</HI> to expostulate with him concerning his encourag|ing the <HI>Indian</HI> Depredations, and to reclaim Captives: His Answer was, that these <HI>Indians</HI> were independant Nations, and not under his Direction; this was a meer Evasion.</P>
<P>After many Bickerings, by good Management in the wise Administration of Lieutenant-Governor <HI>Dummer,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> beg'd and obtain'd a Cessation of Arms, <HI>Decem|ber</HI> 15, Anno 1725, and a Peace the <HI>May</HI> following at <HI>Casco</HI>; saving to the <HI>Indians</HI> all their Lands not hitherto convey'd, with the Privilege of Hunting, Fowling, and Fishing as formerly: Signed by the <HI>Noridgwoag, Penob|scot, St. Iohns,</HI> and <HI>Cape-Sable Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Three or four Years since, some interspersed <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Maryland</HI> were troublesome and occasionally kill'd some <HI>English</HI> Men; they were soon quelled.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the Beginning, the <HI>Indian</HI> Incursions re|tarded them much, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1610, from 500 they, were reduced to 80; from 1612 there was uninterrupted Peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> till 1622, by a sudden general Insurrec|tion they massacred 347 <HI>English</HI> People, reckoned at that Time half of the Colony. Sir <HI>Iohn Harvey</HI> a very ar|bitrary Governor encroached much upon the <HI>Indians</HI> by making enormous Grants of their Lands, this occasion|ed another Massacre from the <HI>Indians</HI> Anno 1639&punc; 500 <HI>English</HI> were cut off, especially about the Head of <HI>York</HI>

River; this was soon over, and Peace lasted many Years. <HI>Anno</HI> 1676 some mutual Murders happened between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> in the Out-Settlements. <HI>Bacon</HI> a hot|headed young Gentleman of the Council, because, as he thought, the Assembly was too dilatory in fitting out a|gainst the <HI>Indians</HI>; in Contempt of the Government, and without a proper Commission, inlists Soldiers of his own Accord, and occasioned an intestine civil Mutiny of the white People against the Government, and obliged the Governor <HI>Berkley</HI> to fly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the remote County of <HI>Acco|mack</HI> upon the Eastern Shore of <HI>Chesapeak</HI> Bay: To quell this Commotion a Regiment of Soldiers was sent from <HI>England,</HI> but <HI>Bacon</HI> dying, the Commotion was o|ver, before the Regiment arrived, this Corps continued there three Years, and were dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anded in <HI>Virginia; Ba|con</HI>'s Body could not be found to be exposed to Infamy.

<P>In NORTH-CAROLINA, Anno 1711, in <HI>November</HI> the <HI>Cape Fear Indians</HI> broke out, and destroy'd about 20 Fa|milies, and much Stock: by Succours from <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> they were soon reduced; and many of the <HI>Tuscararoes</HI> obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake Refuge amongst the <HI>New-York Indian</HI> Nations, where they continue, and are generally called the sixth Nation.</P>

"Upon the Peril of the Penalty of Per|jury" seems not to answer the Intention of an Oath, which is a solemn Invocation of GOD's Judgments hereafter, over and above the Penalties which may be inflicted in this World; thus by Cunning and Secresy they may evade the one, but by no Means can be supposed to escape the other:
It is true, that in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> the Affirmation of <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in <HI>Holland</HI> the Declaration of the <HI>Menists,</HI> are equivalent to our Oaths. Upon the other Hand the Frequency of Oaths upon small Occasions, makes them too familiar, and by taking off the Solemnity and Awe of an Oath renders them nearly upon a Par with common profane Swearing; the many Oaths in the several Branches of the Revenue, particularly in the Customs, are of bad Effect, hence the Proverb, <HI>A Custom-House Oath,</HI> that is, an Oath that may be dispensed with; Oaths give a profligate Man of no Religion (that is who does not think himself bound by an Oath) a vast Advantage over an ho|nest conscientious religious Man: The same may be said of the sa|cramental Tests of Conformity, and occasional Conformity practised by the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P></NOTE> NO RELIGION to that of the most wild <HI>Enthusiasts.</HI>

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1606 <HI>April</HI> 10.

N. Lat. they kept a constant small Trade on Foot, and sometimes wintered ashore, as, for Instance, at <HI>Sagadabock</HI> Anno 1608; but made no formal lasting Settlement, until that of <HI>New Plymouth</HI> Anno 1620; here we must stop and reassume in the Sections of <HI>New-England</HI> Colonies. These Settlements were to have been at 100 Miles Distance from one another, that is, from their chief Place each Territory or Colony was to extend 50 Miles both Ways along Shore, and 100 Miles back into the Country, so as to make a District of 100 Miles square: Thus from the Gulph of <HI>St. Laurence</HI> to <HI>Cape-Fear</HI> we should have had seven Colonies of equal Dimensions, but not of equal Quality; at present in that Space we have about a Dozen Colonies very unequal and irregular, because granted at different Times, most of them run back into the Wilderness indefinitely.

<HEAD>ARTICLE 2. Concerning the general Nature and Consti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ution of <HI>British North-American</HI> Colonies.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our <HI>American</HI> Settlements are properly <HI>Colonies,</HI> not Provinces as they are generally called: <HI>Province</HI>

respects a conquered <HI>People</HI> (the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> may perhaps in Propriety bear this Appellation) un|der a Jurisdiction imposed upon them by the Conqueror; <HI>Colonies</HI> are formed of national People <HI>v. g. British</HI> in the <HI>British</HI> Colonies, transported to form a Settlement in a foreign or remote Country.</P>
<P>The first Settlers of our Colonies, were formed from various Sorts of People. 1. Laudably ambitious <HI>Adven|turers.</HI> 2. The Malecontents, the Unfortunate, the Ne|cessitous from Home. 3. Transported <HI>Criminals.</HI> The present Proportion of these Ingredients in the several Plantations varies much, for Reasons which shall be men|tioned in the particular Sections of Colonies, and does depend much upon the Condition of the first Settlers: Some were peopled by Rebel <HI>Tories,</HI> some by Rebel <HI>Whigs</HI> (that Principle which at one Time is called <HI>Royalty,</HI> at another Time is called <HI>Rebellion</HI>) some by <HI>Church of England Men,</HI> some by <HI>Congregationalists</HI> or <HI>Independants,</HI> some by <HI>Quakers,</HI> some by <HI>Papists (Maryland</HI> and <HI>Mon|serrat)</HI> the most unfit People to incorporate with our Constitution.</P>
<P>Colonies have an incidental good Effect, they drain from the Mother-Country the Disaffected and the Vicious (in this same Manner, subsequent Colonies purge the more ancient Colonies); <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>Providence Plantations,</HI> drained from <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> the <HI>Antino|mians, Quakers,</HI> and other wild <HI>Sectaries.</HI> Perhaps in after Times (as it is at Times with the Lord Lieutenants and other high Officers in <HI>Ireland</HI>) some <HI>Malecontents</HI> of Figure, capable of being troublesome to the Administra|tion at Home, may be sent in some great Offices to the Plantations.</P>
<P>In our Colonies we have four Sorts of People. 1. <HI>Mas|ters</HI> that is Planters and Merchants. 2. <HI>White Servants.</HI> 3. <HI>Indian Servants.</HI> 4. <HI>Slaves</HI> for Life, mostly <HI>Negroes.</HI> White Servants are of two Sorts, viz. Poor People from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> mostly, these are bound or sold, as some expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for a certain Number of Years, to re|imburse
<PB N="207" REF="006307_0214_0F652E121D4BC180">
the transporting Charges, with some additional Profit; the others are Criminals judicially transported, and their Time of Exile and Servitude sold by certain Undertakers and their Agents.</P>
<P>In our <HI>American</HI> Settlements, generally the Designations are, <HI>Province,</HI> where the King appoints a Governor; <HI>Colony,</HI> where the Freemen elect their own Governor: This customary Acceptation is not universal; <HI>Virginia</HI> is called a <HI>Colony,</HI> perhaps because formerly a Colony, and the most ancient.</P>
<P>We have some Settlements with a Governor only; others with Governor and Council, such are <HI>Newfound|land, Nova-Scotia, Hudson</HI>'s-<HI>Bay,</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> without any House orNegative deputed by the Planters, according to the Essence of a <HI>British</HI> Constitution: These, may be said, not colonized.</P>
<P>There are various Sorts of Royal Grants of Colonies. 1. To one or more <HI>personal Proprietors,</HI> their Heirs and Assigns; such are <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>; both Property and Government. 2. The Property to perso|nal Proprietors; the Government and Jurisdiction in the Crown; this is the State of <HI>Carolinas</HI> and <HI>Iersies.</HI> 3. Property and Government in the <HI>Crown,</HI> viz. <HI>Virginia, New-York,</HI> and <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> commonly called <HI>Piscataqua.</HI> 4. Property in the People and their Repre|sentatives; the Government in the Crown; as is <HI>Massa|chusetts-Bay.</HI> 5. Property and Government in the Go|vernor and Company, called the Freemen of the Colony, such are <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P>This last seems to be the most effectual Method of the first <HI>settling</HI> and peopling of a <HI>Colony</HI>; Mankind are na|turally desirous of Parity and Leveling, without any fixed Superiority; but when a Society is come to Maturity, a more distinct fixed Subordination is found to be requisite. <HI>Connecticut, Rhode-Island,</HI> and some of the <HI>Proprietary</HI> Go|vernments, are of Opinion, that they are not obliged to attend to, or follow any Instructions or Orders from their <HI>Mother-Country</HI> or Court of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; they do not
<PB N="208" REF="006307_0215_0F652E12C3D5C7F0">
send their Laws home to the Plantation-Offices to be pre|sented to the King in Council for Approbation or Disal|lowance: They assume the Command of the <HI>Militia,</HI> which by the <HI>British</HI> Constitution is a <HI>Prerogative</HI> of the Crown: Some Time ago, they refused not only a Pre|ventive Custom-House Office, but likewise a Court of Vice-Admiralty's Officers appointed from Home; but these Points they have given up, especially considering that the Royal Charter grants them only the Privilege of trying Causes, <HI>Intra corpus Comitatus,</HI> but not a-float or <HI>Super altum mare.</HI></P>
<P>As a small Country, though rich and thriving, cannot afford large Numbers of People; it ought not to run upon Discoveries and Conquests, beyond what they can well improve and protect; because by over-stretching, they weaken or break the Staple of their Constitution: But they may in good Policy distress as much of the En|emy's Country as is possible, and for some short Time keep Possession of some of their most important Places, though at a great Charge, even, by hiring of foreign Troops; in Order to obtain some suitable profitable E|quivalent. <HI>New-England</HI> with the incidental Countenance of a small <HI>British</HI> Squadron, did easily reduce the <HI>North America Dunkirk,</HI> or <HI>Louisb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urg</HI> in <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> Island; and perhaps luckily, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thout waiting for the Direction of the <HI>British</HI> Ministry. Considering our large Sea and Land-Force, well fitted, upon the <HI>Expeditions,</HI> against <HI>Havanah</HI> and its Territory in the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> the Rendezvous of all the <HI>Spanish Plate-Fleets</HI>; and against <HI>Carthagena</HI> the best Strong-Hold the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in <HI>America</HI>; and against <HI>Canada</HI> called the <HI>New-France</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> which would have given us the Monopoly of the <HI>Cod-Fish</HI> and <HI>Fur-Trade,</HI> many of our <HI>American</HI> Militia voluntarily formed themselves into Companies and Regiments for that Purpose; but the Ministry at Home perhaps for good Reasons best known to themselves, seem to have baulkt these Affairs; the above apparently intended Con|quests would have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asy.</P>

<P>Although the Colonies of various Nations may learn the <HI>Iuvan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia</HI> and the <HI>Laedentia,</HI> from one another; there may be several Political Regulations in Colonies foreign to us, which may have a good Effect with themselves, but may not fit our Constitution; for Instance, 1. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> say, that their vast extensive Settlements in <HI>A|merica,</HI> have continued in due Subjection about 250 Years, by their principal Officers; Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military, being from <HI>Old-Spain</HI>; In <HI>China</HI> (a polite Na|tion) no Man can be a <HI>Mandarin</HI> in his own Country or District, where he was born. 2. The <HI>French, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> Colonies, are not allowed to make <HI>Wines,</HI> and distil <HI>Spirits</HI> of Sugar for Merchandize, because it would hurt the Vent of the Wines and Brandies of their Mother Countries: Some such Regulations with Regard to T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings commonly manufactured in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> not to be manufactured in the <HI>Plantations,</HI> have from Time to Time been laid before the Court of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI> by People disaffected to the Plantations <HI>v. g.</HI> by Col. <HI>D&mdash;r</HI> not long since; but happily, have had little or no Effect.</P>
<P>The several Colonies, particularly those of <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> the most suspected, have it neither in their Power nor Inclination to withdraw from their Dependance upon <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: Of themselves, they are comparatively nothing, without the As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">istance and Protection of some <HI>European</HI> maritime Power; amongst those, the <HI>French, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> differ so much from them in Re|ligion, the most popular Affair, and in an absolute, mon|archial Government inconsistent with our Plantation, le|velling Spirit; that we have nothing to fear from them; the <HI>Dutch</HI> being nearly the same with us in Religion, and apparently (though not really) the same as to a po|pular Government; they bid the fairest for carrying off

<P>Upwards of thirty Years since, upon some Complaints concerning the Colonies, particularly of <HI>South Carolina</HI>; the Court of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> judged, that it might be for the general <HI>British</HI> Interest, to have all Charter and Pro|prietary Governments vacated by Act of Parliament, and accordingly a Bill was brought into the House of Com|mons; but the <HI>New England</HI> Agent <HI>Dummer</HI> by an in|genious Piece which he publish'd at that Time giving the true State of the Colonies, by his Vigilancy, Assiduity, proper Sollicitations and personal Address, and Interest with some of the leading Men, occasioned the Bill to be dropt.</P>
<P>The vacating of all Charter and Proprietary Govern|ments is not the ultimate Chastisement that may be used with delinquent Colonies; the Parliament of <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> may abridge them of many valuable Privileges which they enjoy at present; as happened in an Affair relating to <HI>Ireland</HI>; the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> Anno 1720 passed an Act for the better securing the Depen|dance of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> upon the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: Therefore the Colonies ought to be circumspect, and not offend their Mother-Country; as for Instance, 1. In abusing that Privilege which our Co|lonies have of raising Taxes and assessing of themselves; <HI>South Carolina</HI> had not supplied the nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssary Charges of Government, for four Years preceeding <HI>Anno</HI> 1731; <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> for five Years preceeding <HI>Anno</HI> 1736. 2. In Time of Peace emitting of depreciating publick

<P><HI>Georgia</HI> excepted (<HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> I do not call Colonies) our <HI>American</HI> Colonies have been no Charge to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; a small Matter of Artillery to some of them must be acknowledged, but without Am|munition.

same Censure, where the Fault lies, I shall not, at present relate.</P>
<P>In all our Colonies are many good, industrious, frugal, pious, and moral Gentlemen; I hope the following, ge|neral Character of many of the Populace will give no Offence. 1. Idleness, Intemperance, Luxury in Diet, Extravagancies in Apparel, and an abandoned Way of Living. Our Planters, especially their Children, when they go Home to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> distinguish themselves too much by their Dress, and expensive Way of Living for a short Time. 2. The People of all Colonies (<HI>Bri|tish, French,</HI> &amp;c.) do not seem to have so much Solidity in thinking as in <HI>Europe</HI>; but exceed the European <HI>menu peuple,</HI> as to some little Tricks and Arts in Business ac|quired by Education, and a continued Practice. 3. By importing and expending too much of Superfluities from <HI>Europe</HI>; and in some Colonies by substituting a <HI>Paper-Currency,</HI> they impoverish themselves, and are under a Necessity of sending their <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> as Returns, to <HI>Europe.</HI> 4. A present Profit prevails over a distant Interest.</P>
<P>To avoid Prolixity, but with Impatience, I must defer the Iniquity of a <HI>multiplied Plantation Paper Currency</HI> to the Appendix; it is of no Benefit only to the fraudulent Debtor, they are not ashamed to acknowledge that Equity and natural Justice, they ought to repay the same in real Value which they received; but they say, their Province Laws excuses and indemnifies them, by paying any no|minal Value; and that the compassionate good Creditor, must blame himself for his Forbearance and long Credit, while Money is depreciating: That a multiplied <HI>Paper-Currency</HI> naturally <HI>depreciates</HI> it self, I shall at present only evince by the Instance of the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> November 1747; where are about <HI>Two Millions, One Hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> current publick Bills of Credit not cancelled or burnt, whereof a small Matter is in the Hands of the Receivers of the Taxes; the Opera|tion is, <HI>Bills of Exchange</HI> with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> are risen to the extravagant incredible Height of <HI>One Thousand

<P>A Doctrine or Law, though iniquitous, if not put in Execution, becomes obsolete and of no Effect, and its evil Tendency ceases; but this most execrable Doctrine, has in a most dismal horrid Manner, fre|quently been put in Execution; I shall give a few Instances. 1.

Antecedent to Anno 1707 it seems that a general Toleration limited as above was the religious Establishment of our Colonies; 1.

We must acknowledge that <HI>Predestination</HI> in some political Views has a good Effect; this turns me into an Annotational Digression.</P>
<P>There are many Things, which in a cursory, not well pointed View (as Painters express it) seem shocking, but in a proper political View are beautiful and unavoidably consistent with Society; I shall mention a few Instances. 1. <HI>Predestination</HI> for military Men; <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omet,</HI> and <HI>Cromwel,</HI> found a vast Advantage by this Doctrine; the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hometans</HI> have improved this Doctrine very much amongst their <HI>Militia,</HI> viz. If they conquer they have Profit and Glory in this World, if killed in Battle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have Paradise in the next. 2. A dissolute thoughtless Way of Life, but so regulated, as not to be enormous and prejudicial to Peace and good Neighbourhood; without this tacit Allowance, we should be at a Loss for a sufficient Number of Soldiers and Sailors upon Occasion. 3. Pinching of the very mean Labourers or working People, by lowering or keeping their Wages much under; hereby our Merchants can afford in foreign Markets to undersell the Merchants of other Countries, and consequently vent more of their Produce or Manufacture: Besides, let us suppose, their Employers in Generosity and Beneficence to allow more Wages, than are meerly sufficient to pro|vide them the Necessaries of Life, perhaps, some few of them, may lay up this Surplus, and in a short Time aspire higher than this their mean Labour, thus their Labour is lost; but the greatest Part would idle away so much Time (a Day or two in the Week lost to the publick Good) as this Surplus could supply with Necessaries, to the lessening of our Manufacturies, &amp;c. 4. Encouraging of a great Con|sumption of <HI>British</HI> Goods by Luxury and extravagant Equipage in our Colonies, is thought by some wrong-headed Men to be a Benef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to the Mother-Country: this is a grand M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stake, because Industry and Frugality in all Subservients, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> requisite, othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ways they cannot long afford to continue this Consumption reckoned a Benefit to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> 5.

<P>The Differences in the Modes of BAPTISM are not es|sential; my Voucher is the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> our Dio|cesian, noted by his printed pious super-excellent Pastoral Letters; in a Letter to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Miles,</HI> a Rector of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> dated <HI>Fulham</HI> Sept. 3. 1724.
<Q>I have been informed within these few Days, by a Bishop who had a Letter from <HI>Boston,</HI> that some of the Ministers there, begin the Dispute about the Validity and Invalidity of <HI>Baptism</HI>; administred by Persons not <HI>episcopally</HI> ordained. This was advanced in <HI>England</HI> some Years ago, by the <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> Ene|mies of the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> and present Govern|ment. The Bishops in <HI>Convocation</HI> then assembled, set forth a Paper, proving and declaring, that Baptism by Water in the Name of the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> by what Hand soever administred or however ir|regular, is not to be repeated: This Doctrine, the great Patrons of our Church maintain'd against the

<HI>Dodwel</HI> carried this Affair of <HI>Baptism</HI> to a ridiculous Height, viz. That the Souls of Men were naturally mortal, but <HI>Episcopal Baptism makes them immortal.</HI></P>
<P>The Differences in offering up their PRAYERS, to the <HI>Supreme Being</HI> are not essential; whether, 1.

<P N="3">3.

As an Historian, every Thing is in my Province.

technical Words and Cant-Phrases: As for|merly, instead of true <HI>solid Philosophy</HI> and <HI>natural History,</HI> there was in the Schools only a pedantick <HI>metaphysical Iargon,</HI> which by this Time has received a notable Refor|mation; so I doubt not, that Religion in Time may ad|mit of the like Purity and Simplicity.</P>
<P>In <HI>Great-Britain</HI> there are three distinct <HI>Societies</HI> for propagating Christian Protestant Knowledge or Religion in foreign Parts, incorporated by Royal Charters.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Anno</HI> 1649.

that the principal Design is to propagate Christian Know|ledge, that the Indians may come to the Knowledge of CHRIST; to preach the Gospel to the Heathen; the Care of the Indians bordering upon our Settlements, and such like Expressions: A secondary Design is, to officiate where there is no Provision, or only a small Provision for a Gospel Ministry. Many good Things were originally intended by this Charter, and doubtless the same good Intentions continue with the Society; but in all publick distant Affairs the Managers at Home may be imposed upon: here I beg Leave of the Missionaries, as an His|torian to relate Matters of Fact; if any Missionary thinks that I deviate from the Truth, he may correct me, and I shall be more explicit and particular in the Appendix.

<P>It is a common but mistaken Notion, that sending a|broad Colonies, weakens the Mother-Country: <HI>Spain</HI> is generally adduced for the Instance; but <HI>Spain</HI> being ill peopled does not proceed from thence, it is from their native Sloth, from driving all the <HI>Moors</HI> out of that Country, from a rigorous Inquisition in religious Affairs, from vast Numbers of <HI>Friers</HI> and <HI>Nuns</HI> who do not la|bour, and who are not allowed to propagate their Species, for this Reason, and from the <HI>Popes</HI> being Landlords only for Life; the <HI>Popes</HI> Dominions in <HI>Italy</HI> are almost deso|late of People, but not from sending out of <HI>Colonies</HI>; they have no <HI>Colonies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="006307_0241_0F652E28516DEDE8">The Grandeur of <HI>Phoenicea, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> was much owing to their Colonies; they made no Complaints of their Colonies depopulating their respective Mother-Countries.

<P>An occasional short Character of him may be agreeable. He is of obscure Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entage, in his Youth served aboard the Navy in the meanest Stations, and from some unaccountable Whim or Humour of some of the <HI>Officers</HI> (thus some <HI>Ladies</HI> take a Liking or Fancy to a Monkey, Lap Dog, or Parrot) at present in high Stations, and some Smattering in the <HI>Engineering Business</HI>; he is arrived to be a Warrant Commodore in <HI>America,</HI> where, like a Beggar on Horseback, he rides unmercifully; a Succession of such <HI>Commodores</HI> would contribute to alienate the Aflections of the Colonies from their Mother Country; such <HI>petty Tyrants</HI> in the Colonies answer no Intention.</P>
<P>This Gentleman (a Gentleman by Office, not by Birth) has for many Years been of a valetudinary Constitution, a Distemperature of the Nerves (I do not mean ludicrous) which sometimes seizes his Bowels by violent Cholicks, sometimes his Head with a Kind of Fury or Frenzy: His Courage is not genuine and true, but a Sort of Frenzy, witness his ill conducted, therefore unsuccessful Expeditions a|gainst <HI>La Guira</HI> and <HI>Port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cavallo</HI> in <HI>New-Spain,</HI> Anno 1743: This <HI>Foible</HI> renders him naturally incapable of any chief Command, but qualifies him to act under Direction, pointing his Courage right, as Master of a Fire-Ship, or as a private Captain, upon some desperate Attempt, or forlorn Hope. Madmen will run into the greatest ge|neral Dangers, but at the Frown of their Keeper, or austere Threat|ning of any single Person, are intimidated; thus our Commodore dreads any private Challenge, as appears by Vouchers which may be produc|ed. What I now write, I hope will not be construed as Scurrility but as seasonable and important Truths.</P>
<P>His present State, is; Rash, inconstant, valetudinary Friendship, hated by the common Sailors, and not beloved by his best Officers, laboriously indefatigable in running too and fro, and in expending of Paper; true Symptoms of Madness. This genuine Character of our present Commodore, in Contrast, gives a grand <HI>Relievo</HI> to the univer|sally acknowledged good Character of our late Commodore Sir <HI>Peter Warr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> a Gentleman of paternal Estate, naturally good and humane, always friendly to Trade, benevolent and beloved by his Officers and common Sailors, assiduous and constant, therefore successful and for|tunate.

<P>I shall give a few Instances of his Madness and bad Conduct. 1.

<P>The <HI>impressing</HI> of Seamen has in Part been redressed by a late Act of Parliament. There had long subsisted a Dispute between the <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and the <HI>Trade,</HI> concern|ing the <HI>impressing of Sailors</HI>: The first insisted that, Commanders of Privateers, and Masters of Merchant-Men, did encourage Desertion from his <HI>Majesty's</HI> Ships of War by entertaining and hiring Deserters; the Mer|chants complain'd of the great Hardships upon Trade and Navigation, from the arbitrary unreasonable <HI>Impress</HI> of Hands by indiscreet <HI>Captains</HI> and <HI>Commanders</HI>: To accommodate this Affair the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="006307_0247_0F652E2CE7619E88">
in their Wisdom passed an Act <HI>Anno</HI> 1746, that Privateers or Merchant-Men harbouring Deserters from the King's Ships, should forfeit 50 &pound;. St. per Man; and any Officer of a Man of War <HI>impressing</HI> any Sailor (De|serters excepted) on Shore or on Board should pay 50 &pound;. St. for each Man <HI>impressed.</HI> This Act is only in Relation to the <HI>Sugar-Island Colonies</HI>; it might easily when in Agitation have been extended to the Continent Colonies of <HI>North-America</HI> by proper Application of their several Agents; in a particular Manner <HI>New-England</HI> claimed this <HI>Exemption</HI> (if their Agents had had that Address, In|terest, Vigilancy and Assiduity which their Duty required) by having lately suffered so much in their Persons and Purses by a voluntary Expedition in Favour of their Mo|ther-Country against <HI>Louisbourg</HI>: I am apt to think that being too forward beyond our natural Abilities, may give the Ministry at Home some Reason to imagine, that <HI>New-England</HI> is so encreased in People, as to have many Idlers to spare; as appears by their Order for two Regi|ments of Soldiers (or 2000 Men) from hence, in Addi|tion to the Garrison of <HI>Louisbourg</HI>: At present I hope the Ministry are convinced that <HI>New-England</HI> can not spare Idlers sufficient to make one Regiment compleat. I speak for the Interest of the Country, and impartially in general, my Interest being in that Country some may wrongly think that I am partial.</P>
<P>Before the Plantation or Colony-Trade took Place, the Trade of <HI>England</HI> consisted only in the Exportation of some <HI>Lead, Tin, Leather, Grain,</HI> and <HI>Wool</HI>; by <HI>Colonies</HI> our Trade and Navigation is vastly improved; <HI>Crom|well</HI> and the <HI>Rump-Parliament,</HI> had good Notions of Trade in general, and particularly of the Plantation-Trade; they had a Scheme to bring the <HI>Dutch</HI> to Rea|son, for some Outrages they had done us in our <HI>Spice-Trade</HI> and other Affairs, but the subsequent Reigns of the indolent <HI>Charles</HI> II, and of the Popish-Priest-Rid <HI>Iames</HI> II, were great Damps. The Addition which the Factories and Colonies have made to our Trade and Na|vigation
<PB N="241" REF="006307_0248_0F652E2DA0B34AC8">
is immense, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>India</HI> Trade, <HI>Fur</HI> and <HI>Skin</HI> Trade, <HI>Cod-Fishery</HI> and <HI>Fish-Oil, Naval Stores, Tobacco, Rice, Sugar</HI> and other <HI>West-India Island</HI> Produce. Besides theProfits they afford to the Planters, Merchants and Na|vigation Owners; they yield great Branches of Revenue, to the publick Treasury, the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade about 300,000 &pound;.

<P>In <HI>multiplying of Colonies</HI> there are Boundaries which to Advantage cannot be exceeded; thus our Sugar-Colo|nies produce as much Sugar as we can vent to Profit, the same may be said of <HI>Rice,</HI> and perhaps of <HI>Tobacco</HI>; if we increase in these, their Prices at Market from their Plenty must fall, and not yield a sufficient Profit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Regulations in the Colony-Trade,</HI> ought to be alter|ed according as Circumstances of Time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may require, for Instance, seeing by an <HI>Arret</HI> of the Council of State 1726, the <HI>French</HI> Colonies are allowed to carry their Pro|duce directly to other Ports of <HI>Europe,</HI> but the Vessels to return directly to the Ports of <HI>France</HI> from whence they set out; therefore <HI>Great-Britain</HI> seems to be under a Necessity to take off all <HI>Enumerations</HI> (that of <HI>Sugar</HI> and <HI>Rice</HI> is lately in Part taken off) but that the Vessels which carry Plantation-Goods to foreign Ports, shall clear out from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> before they return to the Plantations, this would prevent their carrying foreign Goods to our Plantations directly, and would maintain the proper De|pendency of the Colonies upon their Mother-Country.</P>

<P>With some Difficulty I perswaded my self to publish this Annota<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion; because, 1.

N. B. An Expression in a former Sheet of this History, is said to have occasioned these Misunderstandings; as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Author hopes that this History may live, he thinks himself obliged to explain that Expression. The Governor's Letters were wrote and delivered though not printed, prior to the Publication of that Sheet) (or Pamphlet as it is termed) which was done by a private Person, not by the Direction or in the Knowledge of the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> conse|quently the Town was not in the Question; the Author hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was under no Temptation to offend one Party, or to pleasure the other Party; he holds no Place under the Governor, he is not a Town-Officer, he never had, nor ever shall desire to have any Influence a|mong the Populace; Government he adores, Tumults he abhors. The Expression is,
"He was welcomed to Town again (the Town-Address or Petition to the Governor, says "on your Return to Town") by the Regiment of Militia under Arms, as is usual upon the Recep|tion of a new Governor, or REASSUMPTION of the Governme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in Allusion to his Reception when he arrived from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe-Breton</HI> to reas|sume the Chair of Government; there was no designed Insinuation of weak Conduct; if any Thing in the Expression is exceptionable, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ought to be construed only as an Impropriety in Diction, a Lapse may be incident to any Author.
2. I do not affect such occasional Articles, they debase a History of permanent Design, to the low Cha|racter of a transitory News-Paper: But as this Affair is too much magnified, and is represented Home in a false and bad Light to the Disadvantage of this Town and Province; I thought it incumbent upon me as an Historian in Place and Time, to give a short impartial Relation of this Incident, more especially to obviate the Imputation of being rebellious, which amongst other bad Effects, might retard the Reimbursement of the great Expence incurred by <HI>New-England</HI> in the Reduction of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and occasion a jealous Regard from the Court of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; from thirty Years Residence in <HI>New-England,</HI> I am convinced that no <HI>British</HI> Subjects have a better Re|gard for the <HI>Hanov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rian</HI> Race or Succession.

<P>Commodore <HI>K&mdash;s,</HI> naturally rash and imprudent, without ad|vising with the Governor and Council, and cautioning his Offi|cers ashore in <HI>Boston</HI> concerning a <HI>Mob</HI> which might probably ensue upon such an extraordinary <HI>Impress</HI>; in the Night-Time with armed Boats did <HI>kidnap</HI> or steal Ship-Builder's Apprentices, and did <HI>rob</HI> Ships (cleared out) of their Crews. Some of these Vessels be|long'd to <HI>Glascow</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> therefore he imagined, or was ill-in|formed, that the <HI>Glascow</HI> Masters and Factors were the Managers of the <HI>Mob</HI>; and in a Transport of Passion, as it was rumoured, said, that all <HI>Scotchmen</HI> were Rebels; if this be made apparent, in Quality of a warrant Commodore he is of Notice, and may be obnoxious to <HI>Scan|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lum magn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tum</HI> of all the <HI>Scots</HI> Peers, and to the Resentment of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Loyal Subject, in History, or otherwise, even to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>In the Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning <HI>Nov.</HI> 17. 1747. Upon this arbitrary unprecedented too rigorous <HI>Impress,</HI> some Sailors, St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">angers, belonging to two or three Vessels bound to <HI>Guinea</HI> and Privateering, fearing the like Fate, did in their own Defence assemble or associate, but without any Fire-Arms, only with the rusty Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lasses belonging to their Vessels, some Clubs and Cat-sticks; this Appearance, as is usual, attracted some idle Fellows of low Circumstances, and lower Character, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oys and Children, which made the <HI>Mob</HI> appear large: This <HI>Mob</HI> suspecting that some of the <HI>Press-Gangs</HI> were in Town, went in Search for them, and some wick|ed abandoned Fellows (a <HI>Mob</HI> is like a Brute Flock of Sheep, they implicitly and without Reasoning follow a Ringleader or Speaker; therefore a Ringleader or Speaker, if convicted as such, ought to suffer for all Felonies and other Damages committed by the <HI>Mob</HI>) proposed to make Reprisals of the Commodore's Officers, as Hostages for the Release of the Town Inhabitants.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mobish</HI> Assembly imagining that those Officers had sheltered themselves (the Government was in Duty obliged to protect them) in the Governor's House, or in the Provincial Court-House; at Noon they appeared before the Governor's House, and in the Evening be|fore the Provincial Court-House; by this Time being much intoxi|cated (which after a few Hours Sleep subsides) they used the Gover|nour, who appeared in the Balcony, with indecent Language; and some naughty Boys and Children, who in Frolicks take Pleasure in the rattling of Glass (sometimes they use the Window-Glass of their Pa|rents Houses with the same Freedom) with Brick Batts broke some Window-Glass of the Court-House, but were reproved by the real <HI>Mob.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Mob</HI> was less impetuous than the Generality of <HI>Mobs</HI>; they used the Sea-Officers well and dismissed them, before the Commodore had dismissed the impressed Town Inhabitants: They did not seize Capt. <HI>Auscough</HI> or <HI>Erskine,</HI> but left him at large upon his Parole.</P>
<P>After the Tumult had subsided, the Commodore advanced with his Fleet to insult <HI>Boston,</HI> which he imagined had insulted him. The Go|vernor in his Letter from Castle-Island to the Secretary, <HI>Nov.</HI> 19. writes,
"I will endeavour to divert him from such Thoughts, and to influence him to discharge the Inhabitants, and as many as I can in the End, but I cannot promise Success from the present Temper he is in;" this insinuates that the Commodore was not Master of his Temper, which is absolutely requisite in a Statesmen, Commander of an Army, or Commodore of a Squadron of Men of War Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 19. in the Morning after the Tumult had subsided, the Com|modore makes an Offer to the Governor, to come in Person to the Castle for the Defence of the Governor's Person and of the Fort, this appears with an Air of Vanity and Assuming; but the Governour in Answer, justly and with Propriety of Character, acquaints him,
"That he did not retire to the Castle for Safety of his Person, and that he had not the least Apprehension of the Castle's being in Danger from any <HI>Mob.</HI>"
Finally the Commodore found it advisable to retire with his Squadron, and after a few Days put to Sea for the <HI>West-India Islanas.</HI></P>
<P>The Affair of the Town-Militia not appearing in Arms when call|ed upon, is not easily to be accounted for. Some say, that 1. The Militia apprehended that the <HI>Tumult</HI> was at an End, upon the Rioters leaving the Governor's House in the Forenoon. 2. That as they were called upon, in Quality of <HI>Posse Comitatus,</HI> that is, in Aid of the civil Officers, and as the civil Officers did not appear to do their Duty they might think it preposterous to appear first; but in Exigencies such Formalities must not be insisted upon. 3. There was no legal <HI>Alarm,</HI> and no written signed Orders to the Militia; especially in Case of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing assaulted by the Tumult, in going to their Rendezvous, or at their Rendezvous, in their own Defence to fire sharp Shot. 4. I conjecture, that they were so s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unned by this rigorous unprecedented <HI>Impress,</HI> and imagining the Affair was in Support of the <HI>Impress,</HI> as being illegal, they thought in Consequence they could not be required to support it.

<P N="8">VIII. TAXES. The different Nature of the several Colonies, will not admit of any general Taxations; there|fore the various Taxes must be local, adapted to the Con|veniencies of each Colony; here I shall only observe, 1. That in these Colonies (in <HI>North-Carolina</HI> there is no o|ther Tax) where there is a Poll-Tax upon all Male Whites from 16 Aet. and upwards, it seems not equitable that a Chimney-Sweeper or the meanest of the People should pay as much (as at present in <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI>) as a Counsellor or Prime Merchant; the People ought to be classed and pay in Proportion, according to their Rank and Substance, 2. That as <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> are not the Necessaries of Life (and therefore Hardship upon the Poor, is not in the Case) there may be a considerable Impost or Custom up|on this Importation, and where Spirits are manufactured (for Instance <HI>Rum</HI> in <HI>Boston</HI>) an Excise at the Still Head. Thus private Tippling Houses that pay no Excise, will have no Advantage over the licensed Houses; upon Ex|portation to draw back the Duties of Impost or Excise. 3. That there be a License-Tax upon all Taverns, Inns, and other publick Houses of that Nature. 4. A <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sumptus</HI> amongst the <HI>Romans</HI> was used to signify <HI>Luxury,</HI> and their <HI>Sumptuaria Lex,</HI> was also called <HI>Cibaria Lex</HI>; but at present it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|nerally used to signify Excess in Apparel and Equipage.</NOTE> sump|tuary

<HEAD>A Digression concerning the <HI>Magnetick Needle,</HI> commonly called the Mariner's Compass.</HEAD>
<P>That the MAGNET or <HI>Loadstone</HI> attracted Iron, was known to the highest Antiquity in Record: But the <HI>Po|larity</HI> of an Iron Rod or Wire, touched by a <HI>Magnet</HI> and afterwards poised, was not observed until the 13th Cen|tury of the <HI>Christian</HI> Aera. The Mariners Compass is said to have been first used in <HI>Italy</HI> (the principal Place of Traffick in those Days) <HI>Anno</HI> 1301. <HI>Cab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> a <HI>Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etian</HI> makes the first Mention <HI>Anno</HI> 1544 of the Variation or Deflection of the <HI>Magnetick Meridian</HI> from a true Meri|dian, various in various Places. <HI>Gasse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">di</HI> about a Century and half since, discovered that this Declination of the Needle in each particular Place, in Process of Time, had some Variation. It is not long since that the Dip of the Needle, various in various Places; and the Variation of this dip Variation in the same Place, has been discover|ed: A Needle poised before it is touched, upon the Mag|netick Touch, its North Point with us dips from a <HI>Ho|rizontal</HI> Position; for Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1723 Mr. <HI>George Graham</HI> in <HI>London</HI> observed it to dip 75 d; he observes, the stronger the Touch, the greater the Dip: This Nee|dle must be afterwards properly loaded to bring it again to an horizontal Poise to serve in the Compass. As the Variations of the Dip are at present of no Use in Naviga|tion, therefore having no Relation to our <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>British American Colonies,</HI> we drop them.</P>
<P><HI>Magnetism</HI> is some Power in Nature, hitherto inexpli|cable, as are <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Electricity</HI>; whereby a <HI>Load|stone</HI> (an Iron Ore or Mineral) draws to it self Loadstone or Iron.

<HI>Steel</HI> is more receptive and retentive of <HI>Magnetism</HI> than common Iron.

<P N="2">2.

Height of the <HI>Barometer.</HI> In the same Day he observed the greatest Variation from Noon to 4 Hours Afternoon, and the least about 6 or 7 Hours in the Evening. Mr. <HI>Ioseph Harris</HI> in his Return from <HI>Iamaica</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> Anno 1732 observed, that the Westerly Variations were less in the Morning than in the Afternoon. The <HI>Curves</HI> of no Variation, and of each particular Variation, do al|ter their <HI>Curvatures</HI> so irregularly and undulatory; they are not reducible to any Equation expressive of their Nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Variations have no Relation to Meridians; ac|cording to <HI>Halley</HI>'s Chart <HI>Anno</HI> 1700, at the Entrance of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Streights, Variation was 29 and half d. West; at the Mouth of <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> nearly under the same Meridian, the Variation was 20 and half d. East. As to Parallels of Latitude it is observed, that the further North or South from the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> the Variations are the greater, but in no regular Progression either as to Distance from the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> or Difference of Time. M. <HI>des Hayes</HI> and <HI>Du Glos</HI> Anno 1682 at <HI>Martinique,</HI> found the Varia|tion 4 d. 10 m. East; Anno 1704 it was 6 d. 10 m. E. this is 2 d. in 21 Years; in the same Interval of Time, it increased at <HI>Paris</HI> 5 d. 30 m. The further from the Lines of no Variation, the Variations seem to increase or decrease the faster.</P>
<P N="4">4. Capt. <HI>Hoxton</HI> from <HI>Maryland,</HI> relates a strange <HI>Phae|nomenon</HI> of his Magnetick Needles orCompasses, <HI>Anno</HI> 1725, <HI>Sept.</HI> 2, a little after Noon, fair Weather, small Sea, in N. Lat. 41 d. 10 m, 28 d. E. Long. from Cape <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> all his Compasses (an <HI>Azimuth,</HI> and 4 or 5 more) carried to several Parts of the Ship continued for about one Hour, traversing very swiftly, so as could not steer by them, but all of a sudden, every one of them stood as well as usual. Capt. <HI>Midleton</HI> in his <HI>Hudson's-Bay</HI> Voyage of 1725; says, that his greatest Variation was 40 d. W. in N. Lat. 63 d. 50 m, 78 d. W. from <HI>London</HI>; where the Compass would scarce traverse: He says, a great Cold or Frost hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers the Needle from tra|versing:
<PB N="267" REF="006307_0274_0F652E464E444090">
where near a great Body of Ice, there were great Complaints of the Compass not traversing: He suspected, that the Age of the Moon had some Influence upon the Variation.</P>
<P N="5">5. The three Lines of no Variation seem to be of different Natures; that Line in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and <HI>Ethiopick</HI> Ocean gives Easterly Variations West of its Line, and Wes|terly Variations East of its Line; that Line in the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean reversly gives Westerly Variations West of its Line; and Easterly Variations East of its Line; that in the <HI>Pacifick Ocean</HI> or <HI>South-Sea,</HI> unexpectedly gives Easterly Variati|ons both Sides; Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> and others, before this third Line was discovered, seem to have laid it down as a Law in Nature, that where an Easterly Variation terminated, a Westerly Variation must begin, and where a Westerly Variation terminated an Easterly Variation was to begin, but further Observations evince this to be no stated Law.</P>
<P>There is a Magnetick Influence all over the Surface of our Globe or Earth; the Magnetick Needle in some Places has a true Meridian Direction, in others the Mag|netick Meridian has a Deflection more or less in different Places, East or West: The Points or Places of no Va|riation, and of the several Quantities of Variation, when connected, form Curves, but so irregular as not reducible to any Equation, and of no permanent Figure, and not easily to be classed: We shall only observe,</P>
<P>There are at present three Lines of <HI>no Variation.</HI> 1. Between <HI>Europe</HI> with <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>America</HI> in the <HI>Atlantick</HI> and <HI>Ethiopick</HI> Ocean; the Variations East and North of this Line are Westerly, and the further distant from this Line, the greater and their Increase or Decrease the swifter, this is a general Principle in Variations; <HI>Halley</HI> says that in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Beginning of this Century, all over <HI>Europe</HI> the Va|riations were Westerly and upon the Increase; but at present, these West Variations in the Eastern Parts of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> seem to be stationary (at <HI>Nuremberg</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> the W.

<P>All <HI>Variations</HI> within this Curve made by the first and third Line, being a Space of 140 d. upon the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> are Easterly; all without it, on its East Side, being a Space of 115 d. to the second Line are Westerly; all without it on its West Side are Easterly, being a Space of 105 d. to the said second Line.

<P>The Alterations in the Variations are not from any uni|form circulatory or libratory Power; but as these mag|netick Powers seem to be accumulated and act connect|edly, it must be by some Kind of Fluctuation; in Oppo|sition to this, it may be said, that the Fluctuation of any dense or specifically heavier considerable Part of the Earth would alter the <HI>Equilibrium</HI> and diurnal <HI>Rotation</HI> of the Earth, and make strange Changes in the fluid Surface of the Earth by Inundations and Ebbs.</P>

<P>I shall by Way of Amusement mention the Arguments

used both Sides of the Question, in Favour of, and in Pre|judice against a N. W. Passage to <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In Favour of a N. W. Passage. 1. The Whales found in Plenty on the West Side of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Bay, as there is no Mention of Whales in <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Straits, they do not come that Way; they cannot come from <HI>Davis</HI> Straits by the frozen Straits of <HI>Midleton,</HI> because of a wide and large Field of Ice; Whales cannot pass under a large Tract of Ice, they cannot live without blowing at Times in the open Air; therefore these Whales must come from the Western orPacifick Ocean, by some Straits or Thorough-Fare in <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Bay: It is more probable that the great Whales in <HI>Davis</HI> Straits, when the Sea there begins to be froze up, pass into the Ocean, or deeper Water, because warmer; Thus the Cod-Fish upon the Coast of <HI>New-England</HI> in very cold Winters, retire into deep Water: Mr. <HI>Dobbs</HI> affirms that <HI>Midleton</HI> see no Whales near <HI>Cape Hope</HI> or the frozen Straits; he judges the frozen Straits to be only a <HI>Chimaera</HI>; therefore the Whales in <HI>Button</HI>'s Bay must come from the Westward. 2. <HI>Wager</HI> River, where was <HI>Midleton</HI>'s principal Enquiry, in N. Lat. 65 d. 24 m. W. Long. 88 d. 37 m; from 7 Miles wide at its Entrance, further up increased to 8 Leagues wide, and from 14 to 80 Fathom Water, and Whales were seen 20 Miles up the Ri|ver. <HI>Dobbs</HI> conjectures that these Whales came from the Western Ocean, by some Strait or Passage South of <HI>Wager</HI> River from N. Lat. 65 d. to 62 d; here it is where the <HI>Eskimaux Indians</HI> follow Whaling, and traded with Capt. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rogs</HI> Anno 1722. 3. <HI>Midleton</HI> from some undue Influ|ence, did not well inspect the Coast, where the greatest Probability was of a Passage, designedly he kept too great an Offing; and descry'd pretended Land and Mountains in the Clouds; concluding there were no Thorough-Fares, he did not send his Boats ashore to try for Inlets. <HI>Fox,</HI> Anno 1632 sailing upon this Coast, see much broken Land and Islands, and Plenty of Whales end of <HI>Iuly.</HI> 4. <HI>Midleton</HI>'s Officers said that the Tide was three Hours sooner at the Mouth of <HI>Wager</HI> River than at Cape <HI>Frigid</HI>;
<PB N="286" REF="006307_0293_0F652E56D0527B68">
therefore the Tide did not come from the frozen Straits and <HI>Baffins</HI> Bay Eastward, but from some Straits West|ward; the same malecontent Officers assured Mr. <HI>Dobbs,</HI> that the higher up <HI>Wager</HI> River, the Water became the salter, and the Flood was from W. S. W. <HI>Midleton</HI> says the Tide came from North-Easterly.</P>
<P>To evince the Impracticableness of a N. W. Passage. 1. The <HI>French</HI> very inquisitive and mindful of their Inter|est, seem to give up any Prospect of this Passage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> they readily renounced for ever to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the sole and exclusive Benefit of a N. W Passage to <HI>China</HI> from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Bay or <HI>Davis</HI> Straits when discovered. 2. The Whales on the WestSide of <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Bay, by the frozen Straits, came from <HI>Davis</HI> Straits where they are plenty. 3. <HI>Midleton</HI> says (we cannot answer for his Vouchers) that <HI>Indian</HI> Travellers have gone by Land from <HI>Churchill</HI> River, as high as the Aretick Circle, but met with no Thorough-Fares; his Northern <HI>Indians</HI> which he took on Board, in <HI>Churchill</HI> River were chiefly designed to shew him theCopper-Mines. 4. The further up<HI>Wager</HI> Ri|ver, the Tides rise less; the Water from salt becomes break|ish, and the higher the more fresh. 5. <HI>Midleton</HI> writes, that from his own Experience, there is no Thorough-Fare from <HI>Churchill</HI> River in N. Lat. 59 d. to N. Lat. 67 d; and further North, if there be any Straits or Thorough-Fare, it cannot be clear of Ice (if ever clear) above a Week or two in the Year, and therefore impracticable: From the River <HI>Wager</HI> to N. Lat. 62 d, he stood into every Bay and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arched the Coast narrowly. 6. As the Winds there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enerally from the N. W. and excessively cold, there must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a long continued or connected Tract of Land West|ward, covered with perpetual Snow and Ice and therefore impracticable. Moreover, if there is any such Strait, it is narrow and long; the Adventurers would run a certain Risk of being froze up and of perishing.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Concerning the Island of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and its <HI>Cod-Fishery.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS is a Fishery of longer standing, than are any of our Colony or Plantation Settlements; it is noColony, it is not confined to any Patent or exclusive Company, but is an open general <HI>British</HI> Cod-Fishery, consisting of many Lodges, or commodious Harbours for curing of Cod-Fish, for the <HI>Spanish, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Markets.</P>

Lat. 50 d. 30. m; by the Cod-Fish being more plenty, and by falling in nearer the Shore, the Cod-Fishery of the North Part of the Island, seems to be more profitable than upon the Southern Harbours of the Island; by this Concession before the War <HI>An.</HI> 1744 the <HI>French</HI> had the better of us in the Cod-Fishery Trade.&mdash;King <HI>Charles</HI> I. bubled by the <HI>French,</HI> gave them a Liberty of fishing and curing Fish in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> upon the silly Pretext of supplying an <HI>English</HI> Convent in <HI>France</HI> with Fish.</P>

<P>The following Accounts of Fisheries fall in naturally with this Section, and carries along with it some Account of the <HI>New England</HI> Fishery.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="digression">
<HEAD>A <HI>DIGRESSION</HI> concerning Fisheries.</HEAD>
<P>The principal and extensive Branches of Fishery in Com|merce, are 1. <HI>Whaling,</HI> which is in common to all maritime Nations, but followed to best Advantage by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it is
<PB N="295" REF="006307_0302_0F652E5DB0478328">
called the great Fishery, as Herring, and Cod fishing are called the small Fisheries. 2. <HI>Herrings,</HI> of these the <HI>Dutch</HI> also make the most Gain, although the only herring Fishery, known to us, of Quantity and Quality, sufficient and pro|per for the Markets, is confined to the <HI>British</HI> Seas which is a <HI>Mare Clausum,</HI> and in all Respects is the <HI>British</HI> peculiar Property, excepting that it is a natural Thorough-Fare or high Way to all Nations in their outward bound and in|ward bound Voyages; and <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with greater Propriety, may be called Herrings Island, than <HI>Newfound|land</HI> called <HI>Terra de Baccaleos</HI>: The <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. agreed to pay annually to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &pound; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 Sterling for Licence or Liberty of fishing for Herrings upon the Coasts of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they paid only for one Year 1636 and no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Cromwel</HI> in his Decla|ration of War against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> made a Demand of the Arrears of this licence Money (at the same Time he insi|sted upon Satisfaction for the <HI>Amboyna</HI> Affair) but the principal Differences which occasioned the War being soon accommodated, these Demands were dropt. 3. <HI>Cod-Fish.</HI> The <HI>European</HI> North Sea Cod, the Cod from the Banks of <HI>Holland</HI> and Coast of <HI>Ireland</HI> are much superiour in Quality to the <HI>American</HI> Cod; but in no Degree ade|quate to the <HI>Spanish, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Markets: the Cod Fishery to supply Markets, is peculiar to <HI>New|foundland, Nova Scotia,</HI> and <HI>New England</HI>: If <HI>Great Britain,</HI> pending this <HI>French</HI> War, continue with Success to reduce the <HI>French</HI> Trade and Colonies, we may give the Law; and have <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> the Islands in the Gulph of <HI>St. Laurence, Nova Scotia</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> confirmed to us in Perpetuity; with an exclusive Trade and Navigation upon the Coasts thereof to the Extent Seaward of &mdash; Leagues; thus we shall have the Monopoly of the Cod-Fishery; at a low Estate, we can afford at a Medium 300,000 Quintals <HI>per Annum,</HI> whereof <HI>Bilboa</HI> the dry Cod-Fishery Barcadier takes off from 70,000 to 80,000 Quintals <HI>per An.</HI> to supply <HI>Madrid,</HI> and some other inland Countries of <HI>Spain</HI></P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="006307_0303_0F652E5E63E1FD48">To render these Accounts distinct, I shall reduce them to five Heads. 1. The <HI>Whale-Fishery.</HI> 2. <HI>Herring-Fishery.</HI> 3. <HI>Cod-Fishery.</HI> 4. The <HI>smaller Fisheries</HI> ex|portable but of no great Account. And, 5. Some <HI>Fish</HI> not exportable or merchantable, but of great Benefit in present spending especially for the Poor.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHALES. See a Digression concerning Whaling, P. 56. we shall further add the following Remarks; Whales, that is the true or Bone Whales go South|ward (they are Passengers according to the Seasons) towards Winter, and return Northward in the Spring. Formerly in <HI>New-England Cape-Cod</HI> embay'd them, but being much disturbed (they seem to have some Degree of Reason) they keep a good Offing. The smaller Whales, viz. <HI>Sperma Ceti, Fin-Backs, Hump-Backs,</HI> &amp;c. which ne|ver go far to the Northward, but stroll considerably South|ward, are apt to strand upon the Shoals of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> and <HI>Bahama</HI> Banks: They become Drift Whales, and some afford drift <HI>Sperma-Ceti.</HI> In their Passages North and South, having kept an Offing to the Banks, tho' they were incommoded by the Whale-Fishers; at present in their Passages they keep deep Water; and upon a Peace the Whalers are to fish for them in deep Water.</P>
<P><HI>New-England</HI> Whaling at present is by Whaling Sloops or Schooners with two Whale-Boats and 13 Men; each Boat has an Harpooner, a Steersman, and four Rowers: The Whale-Boats do not use Thaughts but Nooses for their Oars, upon Account of Expedition; because only by letting go their Oars, without loosing of them, they keep expeditiously long Side of the Whale. The best Place of striking a Whale is in her Belly, about one Third from her Gills; the Fast is a Rope of about 25 Fathom; then a Drudge or Stop-Water, a Plank of about 2 Feet square, with a Stick through its Center; to the further End of this Stick, is fastned a Tow-Rope, called the Drudge Rope of about 15 Fathom; they lance, after ha|ving fast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed her by the Harpoon, till dead.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="006307_0304_0F652E5F33D85AA8">The <HI>New England</HI> Whalers reckon so many Ct. Wt. Bone, as Bone is Feet long: For Instance, 7 Foot Bone gives 700 Wt. Bone: <HI>New-England</HI> Bone scarce ever e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeds 9 Feet; and 100 Barrels Oil is supposed to yield 1000 Wt. of Bone Whales kill'd in deep Water, if they sink, never rise again.</P>
<P><HI>Sperma Ceti</HI> Whales do not go far North; they are gregarious, or in Sholes; they go Southward to the <HI>Ba|hama</HI> Islands in <HI>October,</HI> and return in the Spring: Most of the <HI>Bermudas</HI> Whales are Finbacks, 20 to 30 <HI>pr. An.</HI> caught.</P>
<P>A Whale stranded back of <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> yielded 134 Bar|rels Oil, and &mdash; Wt. of Bone; this Whale was so fat, that, some poor People tried the muscular Flesh, and made 30 Barrels more Oil. In <HI>New-England</HI> Whaling, they go upon Shares, one Quarter to the Vessel or Own|ers, the rest to the Company, finding themselves victual|ing and whaling Geer. The Whalers in deep Water, or at a considerable Distance from <HI>Nantucket,</HI> fit out in the Beginning and Middle of <HI>March.</HI> Third Week of <HI>Iuly</HI> Anno 1738 arrived our Whalers from <HI>Davis Straits.</HI> The <HI>New-England</HI> True Whale, is the same with the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> North-Cape Whales, are not easily kill'd, being a|gile and very wild; the <HI>Dutch</HI> do not fish them. <HI>Sperma Ceti</HI> Whales do not go far North, they pass by <HI>New-England</HI> in <HI>October,</HI> and return in the Spring. <HI>Grampus's, Bottle-noses,</HI> and the other small <HI>Cetaceous</HI> Kind are called <HI>Black Fish.</HI></P>
<P>It is not easily to be accounted for, that Whales do not in Course of Years become scarcer; considering the con|tinued great Slaughter of them by the Whaling Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, they bring only one Calf at a Time after many Month<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gestation, whereas other Fish spawn Multitudes.</P>
<P>Fish-Oil is, 1. That from the True or Whale-Bone Whale, and the other large Whales. 2. <HI>Vitious Oil</HI> from the <HI>Sperma Ceti</HI> Whales. 3. <HI>Black Fish Oil</HI> from <HI>Grampus's&punc; Bottle-noses, Porpus's,</HI> &amp;c. of the small <HI>Cetaceous</HI> Kind. 4. <HI>Liver-Oil</HI> from the Livers of sundry Fishes, especially
<PB N="298" REF="006307_0305_0F652E5FDA2D37B8">
of Cod-Fish. 5. That from the Blubber or <HI>Penicula adiposa</HI> of Seals and Sea-Cows. There are two Sorts of Seals, one Sort has its Skin dappled or in small Spots, the other Sort called the <HI>Ice-Seal,</HI> hath a large black Patch, runs slow, and is kill'd by a small Blow on the Head; 500 have been killed in a Harbour at <HI>Newfoundland</HI> in a Morning; the Skins and Blubber is their mercantile Produce. The <HI>Sea-Cow</HI> or <HI>Morse</HI> is plenty upon the Coasts of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> particularly at the Island of <HI>St. Iohns</HI>; it is of the Bigness of a midling Cow (it is not the same with the <HI>Manatee</HI> of the Gulph of <HI>Mexico</HI>) a very thick Skin with Hair like that of a Seal.</P>
<P>In cold Winters the Whales, as do other Fish, keep in deep Water. The <HI>New-England</HI> People whale with a Drudge or Stop-Water, not with long Ropes or Warps as the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Upon the Coast of <HI>New-England,</HI> Whales go Northward from the Middle of <HI>March</HI> to the Middle of <HI>May.</HI> About 30 Years ago, <HI>Communibus An|nis</HI> were exported from <HI>New-England</HI> about 5,000 Bar|rels of Fish-Oil, at this Writing <HI>Anno</HI> 1748, about 10,000 Barrels, notwithstanding the Whales keeping a greater Offing.</P>
<P N="2">2. HERRINGS.

<P>It seems more reasonable to think, that these <HI>Herrings</HI> are constant Retainers to the Islands of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> some Times disappearing in deep Water, and at other Times appearing in Shole-Water, according to their various feed|ing and spawning Grounds; so as annually to make the Circuit of these Islands; and as is the Manner of all Pas|senger Fish, go Northward towards Summer, and South|ward towards Winter or cold Weather, and in very cold Weather take to deep or warmer Water. And in Fact or Observation we find the Herrings appear amongst the Western Islands of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Spring, they are at <HI>Shetland</HI> and the North Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Summer, they are a|long the East and South Coasts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in Au|tumn, and in <HI>St. Georges</HI> Channel in Winter.</P>
<P>The <HI>British Herrings</HI> spawn in <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September</HI>: When they spawn, the Fishermen call it fouling of the Water; it is said they go by Pairs to the Bottom, and rub their Bellies in the Mud and Sand until their <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> Milts and Rows are discharged; soon after this the <HI>Herring-Fishery</HI> is supposed to be over, and that the <HI>Herrings</HI> take to Sea or deep Water.</P>

<P>The <HI>Herrings</HI> of <HI>Newfoundland, Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> are either of a different Species, or of a bad Quality, and if in curing their Quality could be remedied, they are not of a sufficient Quantity to supply the <HI>Her|ring</HI> Markets: They are caught in Seans or Mashes,

they have been pickled and barrelled for the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands, but turned out not merchantable, and that Branch of Fishery was dropt. In <HI>Newfoundland</HI> they come in by <HI>Autumn,</HI> being their last bait Fish. In <HI>New-England</HI> notwithstanding of their being a periodical Fish, their Periods are uncertain; at present they are not so plenty as formerly, and generally set in to spawn to|wards the End of Winter.</P>

<P N="3">3. COD-FISHERY. The <HI>Scots</HI> or North Sea dry Cod, and the <HI>New-England</HI> Winter dry Cod, are of the prime Quality; they will bear watering; Summer Fish of <HI>New-England</HI> when watered, breaks. Large Winter Cod dry Fish, is the best for <HI>Bilboa</HI> Market, it retains its Mel|lowness and will bear Land-Carriage to <HI>Madrid,</HI> smaller Fish will answer in other Markets; in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> they are not reckoned merchantable if under 18 Inches in Length, from the first Fin to the setting on of the Tail, and are allowed no Salt Debenture or Bounty. <HI>August</HI> and <HI>September</HI> are the best Times for selling a Fish Cargo in the <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Countries, their <HI>Lent</HI> Stock by that Time is expended.</P>
<P>The <HI>New-England</HI> Fishery have their Salt, from <HI>Sal|tortugas, Cape de Verde</HI> Islands, <HI>Turks</HI> Islands or <HI>Bahamas, Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Bay of Biscay.</HI> The Fishermen victual with salt Pork only, Biscuit, and Rum. All Cod-Fish caught from the Beginning of <HI>Iune</HI> to the Beginning of <HI>October</HI> are called Summer Fish, the others are called Spring and Fall Fish or Winter Fish, and are of the bet|ter Quality. The Salt Fleet from <HI>Tortugas</HI> generally ar|rives in <HI>New-England</HI> about the Middle of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><HI>New-England</HI> dry Cod-Fish, is more Salt burnt than those of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> because in <HI>New-England</HI> they ge|nerally
<PB N="302" REF="006307_0309_0F652E64ED38B4B8">
use Salt from <HI>Tortugas</HI> and the <HI>Isle of May,</HI> which is too fiery; at <HI>Newfoundland</HI> they make Use of Salt from <HI>Lisbon</HI> and the <HI>Bay of Biscay,</HI> of a milder Qua|lity: In <HI>Newfoundland</HI> they work their Fish Belly down, in <HI>New-England</HI> they work them Belly up, to receive more Salt, and add to their Weight. No Sun-burnt, Salt-burnt, or that have been a considerable Time pickled be|fore dried, are to be deem'd merchantable Fish.</P>
<P><HI>Marblehead</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> ships off more dry'd Cod, than all the rest of <HI>New-England</HI> besides; <HI>Anno</HI> 1732 a good Fish Year, and in profound Peace, <HI>Marblehead</HI> had about 120 Schooners of about 50 Tuns Burthen, 7 Men aboard, and one Man ashore to make the Fish, is about 1000 Men employed from that Town, besides the Sea|men who carry the Fish to Market; if they had all been well fish'd, that is 200 Quintals to a Fare, would have made 120,000 Quintals; at present <HI>Anno</HI> 1747 they have not exceeding 70 Schooners, and make 5 Fares yearly; first is to <HI>Isle of Sable,</HI> the Cod-Fish set in there early in the Spring, and this Fare is full of Spawn; for|merly they fitted out in <HI>February,</HI> but by storm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wea|ther having lost some Vessels, and many Anchors, Cables and other Gear, they do not fit out until <HI>March</HI>; their se|cond Fare is in <HI>May</HI> to <HI>Brown's Bank,</HI> and the other Banks near the <HI>Cape-Sable</HI> Coast, these are also called Spring-Fish; their third and fourth Fares are to <HI>St. Georges Bank,</HI> called Summer Fish; their fifth and last Fare is in Autumn to <HI>Isle of Sables,</HI> these are called Winter Fish. <HI>New-England</HI> Cod is generally cured or dry'd upon Hur|dles or Brush. <HI>Anno</HI> 1721 were cured at <HI>Canso</HI> of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> 20,000 Quintals of Cod-Fish; but, as it is said, the Officers of that Garrison used the Fishermen ill, and no Fishery has been kept there for many Years. At pre|sent <HI>Anno</HI> 1747, there is cured in all Places of <HI>British North America</HI> about 300,000 Quintals dry merchantable Cod.</P>
<P>There are several other Particulars relating to the Cod-Fishery interspersed in the former Sheets, which we shall

not repeat, left we should deviate from the Character of a Summary. We shall observe, that the <HI>French</HI> have been too much conniv'd at in carrying on a considerable Cod-Fishery near the Mouth of the River <HI>St. Laurence</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Gaspee</HI> contrary to Treaty, because it lies in <HI>Nova-Scotia.</HI> Continued Westerly or dry Winds are not requisite in curing dry Cod, because they must be sweated in Piles by some damp Easterly Weather. Winter Fish ought not to be shipt off 'till <HI>May</HI>; for although the preceed|ing Frosts makes them look fair and firm, if ship'd off too soon, the subsequent Heat of the Hold, makes them sweat and putrify. The Stock Fish of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Ise|land,</HI> are Cod cured without Salt, by hanging in the Frosts of Winter upon Sticks, called <HI>Stocks</HI> in <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. SMALLER FISHERIES used in Commerce; we shall mention a few.</P>
<P><HI>Scale Fish</HI> so called, viz. <HI>Haddock, Hake,</HI> and <HI>Polluc,</HI> which in <HI>New-England</HI> are cured in the same Manner as dry Cod; those together with the dry Cod that is not fit for <HI>European</HI> Markets, are ship'd off to the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands, towards feeding of the Negro Slaves, and make a considerable Article in our Trade to the Sugar-Islands.</P>
<P><HI>Mackrel,</HI> split, salted and barrel'd for the Negroes in the Sugar Islands, are caught either by Hook, Seans, or Mashes; those by Hook are the best, those by Seans are worst, because in Bulk they are bruised; Mackrel will not take the Hook, unless it have a Motion of two or three Knots, if quicker they will take the Hook, but their Jaw being tender gives Way and the Mackrel is lost. There are two Seasons of Mackrel, Spring and Autumn, the Autumn Mackrel are the best; those of the Spring appear about Middle of <HI>May,</HI> very lean, and vanish in two or three Weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Sturgeon</HI> very plenty; some are 12 Feet long, and weigh 400 Wt. formerly a Merchant of <HI>Boston,</HI> contract|ed with some Fishmongers in <HI>London,</HI> Anno 1721 he sent 1500 Cags of 40 to 50 wt. (the Contract was for 5000

Cags <HI>per An.</HI>) the Fish were good but too salt or ill-cured; this Fishery did not answer, and it was dropt. <HI>London</HI> is supplied with Sturgeon from <HI>Dantzick, Ham|burg</HI> and <HI>Pilau.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Salmon</HI> are plenty in all the <HI>British North-America</HI> Ri|vers from <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to about N. Lat. 41 d. they set in to <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> about the Middle of <HI>April,</HI> they do not chuse warm Weather, therefore do not continue there long after having spawn'd; further North they con|tinue many Months. This Salmon is not of a good Qua|lity, and is not so good for a Market, as the Salmon of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5. FOR SPENDING FRESH. Besides the above menti|oned Fish, which are also eat when fresh, there are many Sorts which are not cured and ship'd off.

<P>Many Fish go up the Rivers, and into Ponds, earlier or later in the Spring to spawn, viz, <HI>Salmon, Shad, Ale|wives, Tom-Cod, Smelts,</HI> &amp;c; and many good Laws have been made in <HI>New-England,</HI> to prevent their Passages from being stopt by Wares <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they are of gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Inhabitants near these Rivers and Ponds.</P>

I shall endeavour to relate it with Ex|actness and Impartiality; by ascribing every Step of it to Providence, I hope it will not be construed as detracting from the Merits of the Country of <HI>New-England,</HI> the Place of my Abode or Home. The Motto may be <HI>Audaces For|tuna juvat,</HI> and with good Propriety may be termed <HI>Dig|nus vindice nodus,</HI> and without Imputation of Cant, be as|cribed to some extraordinary Interposition of Providence in our Favour:
Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> in a Speech, observes, that "scarce such an Instance is to be found in Histo|ry:"
A Colonel in this Expedition, gave it this Turn "That if the <HI>French</HI> had not given up <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> we might have endeavoured to storm it with the same Pros|pect of Success, as the Devils might have stormed Hea|ven."
The annual Convention of the <HI>New-England</HI> Mi|nisters, in their Address to the KING, call it,
"The wonderful Success GOD has given your <HI>American</HI> Forces:"
A Clergyman from <HI>London</HI> writes "This prosperous E|vent, can hardly be ascribed to any Thing short of an In|terposition from above truly uncommon and extraordina|ry: These Expressions of the Governor's, &amp;c. ought not to be construed as derogating from the most bold Adven|ture of the <HI>New-Englanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Reduction of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> was much above our Capacity; in short, if any one Circumstance had taken a wrong Turn on our Side, and if any one Circumstance had not taken a wrong Turn on the <HI>French</HI> Side, the Ex|pedition must have miscarried, and our Forces would have returned with Shame, and an inextricable Loss to the Pro|vince; as this was a private or Corporation Adventure without any Orders from the Court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the Charges would not have been reimbursed by the Par|liament; and the People of <HI>New-England</HI> from Gene|ration to Generation would have cursed the Advisers and Promoters of this unaccountably rash Adven|ture.</P>

The Expedi|tion sail'd from <HI>Canso</HI> April 29, and next Day arrived in <HI>Chapeau rouge</HI> Bay a little South of <HI>Louisbourg</HI>; here in landing our Men we were oppos'd by a Body of upwards of 100 regular Troops (whereof 24 were of the <HI>Swiss</HI> Com|pany) commanded by <HI>Maurepang,</HI> formerly a noted Sea Rover; we suffered no Loss, the <HI>French</HI> retired with the Loss of 8 Men killed and 10 made Prisoners; from <HI>Canso</HI> we had sent a small Party to <HI>St. Peters</HI> a small <HI>French</HI> Set|tlement upon <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> and burnt it.</P>

<P>By Way of Amusement, I may take Notice of some <HI>New-England</HI> Poems, upon this Occasion (not in Disparagement to the Country, here at present some true poetical Genius's begin to appear) I shall mention only two Instances; the first is by Mr. <HI>Niles</HI> in the lowest doggrel Rhime, in Imitation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Lists and Characters of the command|ing Officers at the Siege of <HI>Troy</HI>; the Instance is

In the beginning upon <HI>Greenhill</HI> 1550 Yards distant from the King's Bastion called the <HI>Citadel,</HI> we erected a Battery of a very few small Cannon, one 13 Inch, one 11 Inch, and one 9 Inch Mortars; they could

do no Execution; <HI>May</HI> 7, a Battery was made at 900 Yards Distance, and we summoned the Town; <HI>May</HI> 17, a Battery was advanced to 250 Yards Distance from the West Gate; <HI>May</HI> 20, on the other Side of a Creek was erected aBattery of five 42 Pounders, called <HI>Tidcomb</HI>'s Bat|tery, to batter the Circular Battery and Magazine.</P>
<P>We made no regular Approaches by Trenches, that is, by Parallels and Zigzags, but bombarded the Town at Random, and did much Damage to the Roofs of the Houses; the West Gate was defaced, the adjoining Cur|tain and Flank of the King's Bastion were much hurt, but no practicable Breach.</P>
<P>The <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Sunderland</HI> being arrived it was re|solved to storm the Town by Sea <HI>Iune</HI> 18, by three 60, one 50, and four 40 Gun Ships, while the Land Forces ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a Feint or Diversion ashore: The <HI>French</HI> were a|fraid to stand it, and capitulated <HI>Iune</HI> 17, to march out with the Honours of War, not to serve for 12 Months, to be allowed all their personal Effects, and to be trans|ported to <HI>France,</HI> at the Charge of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Place was put under the joint Administration of <HI>Pepperrell</HI> and <HI>Warren</HI>; and all future Charges were to be defray'd by their Bills upon the Pay-Master General and Ordnance. According to the enlisting Proclamation, our Militia were to be discharged so soon as the Expedi|tion was over; Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> arrived in <HI>Louisbourg</HI> Aug. 17, and persuaded them to continue; but notwith|standing, if the <HI>Vigilant,</HI> the <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Louisbourg</HI> Fire Ship had not continued there over Winter, the Militia might have been discouraged, and the Place in Danger of being surprized by the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Ca|nada, Nova Scotia,</HI> and <HI>St. Iohns</HI> Island.</P>

The Project of raising two Regiments in <HI>New-England</HI> was faulty in two Respects. 1. A young Settlement, al|ready much reduced in their young Men, by late Expe|ditions; to exhaust them more by standing Levies, is a grievous Hardship; it not only retards or stunts the Growth of the Colony, but in Fact, miniorates them, and puts them backwards; this is the general Complaint of the Country, extravagant Price of Labour, and Want of Labourers. 2. The publick Disappointment of the In|terest of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where 2000 Men are depended upon; of these 1000 perhaps are and ever will be Non-Effectives, it being impracticable for the Country to spare so many Men, for standing or continued Regular Troops.</P>
<P>Perhaps the speculative original Design, at Home might appear specious, that is, 1. A Garrison of Men in|digenous, Natives of, or habituated to the Climate. 2. That by reserving some Officer's Commissions, to the Disposal of the Colonels; the Gentlemen of our Militia, who had distinguish'd themselves in the Expeditions, might have some Reward for their Merit; this last De|sign was attended with the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I write with Freedom, impartial, disinterested Readers, will excuse me in Quality of a disinterested Historian; I have no per|sonal Disregard or Malice, and do write of the present Times, as if these Things had been transacted 100 Years since.</NOTE> Inconveniency of being per|verted; by bestowing these Commissions to Purchasers, to Relations, and to Friends.</P>

<P>From Time to Time, anticipating the Affair of Currencies referred to the Appendix, may be excused: this pernicious desolating Torrent becoming more and more violent, requires a more speedy Resistance.</P>
<P>The Colony of <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> was the Leader of Paper Curren|cies in the <HI>British</HI> Plantations, and have now at Length carried this Fraud to the utmost (even beyond <HI>North Carolina</HI> Management) if car|ried further the Staple must break, and the Fraud of the wicked Pro|jectors (in all Affairs there are Limits which in the Nature of Things cannot be exceeded) cease.</P>
<P>I shall enumerate some of the many Mischiefs attending the bad fraudulent Management of Paper Currencies. I. From an Equality with Sterling, afterwards with Proclamation Value, they have reduced the Value of our Currency to 10 for 1 8t. II. The Governor and Legislature keep up their Salaries and Wages to the Sterling Value, but seemingly allow all other Transactions to run into Confusion and ruinous Depreciations. III. The Depreciations might have in a great Measure been obviated, even when there were great Exigencies for present Money; thus after the first Emissions being 40,000 &pound;. Anno 1690 and 1691 to pay off the publick Debts incurred by <HI>Phips</HI>'s Ca|nada Expedition, when there was an Appearance of an ensuing De|preciation, if more were emitted; the Government did wisely borrow the Bills already emitted, from the Possessors, with good Effect, and these Bills did not depreciate: If, in the <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> and amusing late <HI>Canada</HI> Expeditions, we had done the same&punc; it would have had the like good Effect with Respect to the Publick, but would not have answered the wickedIntentions and Occasions of thePromoters of these Bills, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Of those who had acquired the Craft of negotiating (in troubled Waters good Fishing) these depreciating Bills to their own Advantage. 2. Of those who were to liberate their mortgaged E|states by defrauding their Creditors with a depreciated nominal Value, instead of the true contracted Value&punc; well knowing that a multiplied Paper Credit, depreciates itself more and more. IV. By Act of As|sembly a publick Bill of Credit explicitly in its Face promising only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>oz.</HI> 13 <HI>d.</HI> 8 <HI>gr.</HI> Silver, shall be equal to a Bill promising 3 <HI>oz.</HI> Silver&punc; that is, in common Arithmetick, 8 shall be equal to 9. V. In the same Kind of Impositions, used by <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wis</HI> XIV. of <HI>France,</HI> who by Recoinages from Time to Time miniorated his Money, at Length finding his People reduced to insensible <HI>Dupe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> he sav'd the Charge of recoining, and uttered the same Coin with only some little Mark or Stamp, at a further depreciated Value; in <HI>Iune</HI> 1744, to save the Charge of New Plates, we miniorated the Value of the Emissions of <HI>Nov.</HI> 1741, by a few Dashes upon the same Plate.</P>
<P>Finally, some say, that as it is a Maxim in the civil Law, <HI>Qui Civem servare potest, et non servat, occidit</HI>; the proper Check negative in the Legislature, ought to bear all the Blame of these iniquitous Depreci|ations, and Absurdities which expose the Province.</P></NOTE> very b&mdash;d Administration, we have exceeded all our Colonies, even <HI>North Carolina</HI> where their Paper Money was at a Discount with a fallacious cheating Truck, it is 10 for 1 St.; ours is somewhat worse in good Bills St.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE 2. Concerning <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> formerly called the <HI>Duke of York's</HI> Property.</HEAD>
<P>KING <HI>Charles</HI> II, <HI>March</HI> 12. 1663, 4 granted to his Brother the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a certain Territory or Tract of Land, thus described,
"All that Part of the main Land of <HI>New-England,</HI> beginning at a certain Place, called or known by the Name of <HI>St. Croix</HI> adjoining to <HI>New-Scotland</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> and from thence extending along the Sea Coast, unto a certain Place called <HI>Pemaquin</HI> or <HI>Pema|quid,</HI> and so up by the River thereof, to the furthest Head of the same, as it tendeth Northwards, and extending from thence to the River of <HI>Quenebec,</HI> and so up by the shortest Course to the River of <HI>Canada</HI> Northwards."
This was called the <HI>Duke of York</HI>'s Property, and annexed to the Government of <HI>New York.</HI> The Duke of <HI>York</HI> upon the Death of his Brother K. <HI>Charles</HI> II, became K. <HI>Iames</HI> II; and upon K. <HI>Iames</HI>'s Abdication these Lands reverted to the Crown.</P>
<P>At present the Territory of <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> is supposed to extend from the River <HI>St. Croix</HI> Eastward, to the River of <HI>Quenebec</HI> Westward, and from each of these two Ri|vers due North to the River of <HI>St. Laurence,</HI> thus <HI>St. Lau|rence</HI> or <HI>Canada</HI> River is its Northern Boundary, and the Atlantick Ocean is its Southern Boundary. When <HI>Nova
<PB N="383" REF="006307_0390_0F652EA9825FECE8">
Scotia</HI> was in Possession of the <HI>French, Sagadahoc</HI> Terri|tory was included in the Commission of the <HI>French</HI> Go|vernor of <HI>L'Accadie</HI> or <HI>Nova Scotia</HI>; thus it was in the Time of granting a new royal Charter to <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> therefore to keep up the <HI>English</HI> Claim to this Ter|ritory, as well as to <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> the Jurisdiction of both were included in that Charter.</P>
<P>Upon the Peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> 1713, <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> and <HI>Sa|gadahoc</HI> were quit claim'd by <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; and the Court of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> reassumed the Jurisdiction of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and after a few Years more, the Crown purchased the Property of the Soil or <HI>Seigneurie</HI> of all the <HI>French</HI> Claimers; it is now a separate King's Government, with the Property in the Crown: But this Territory of <HI>Sagadahoc</HI> remains in the Jurisdiction of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and sends one Member to the Council, but hitherto not any to the House of Representatives of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay:</HI> The General Assembly cannot dispose of Lands there, without the Consent of the King in Council. The Pro|perty of peculiar Grants there, remain good to the several Claimers, until the Crown do purchase the same as was the Case in <HI>Nova Scotia.</HI></P>
<P>Col. <HI>Dunbar</HI> projected <HI>Sagadahoc</HI> Territory to be set off as a separate Government for himself; this was introduc|ed, by obtaining a royal Instrument or Instruction, to set off 300,000 Acres of good Mast and Ship-Timber Land, for the Use of the Crown or Navy; it was forwarded by a royal Instruction to Col. <HI>Phillips</HI> Governor of <HI>Nova Scotia</HI> April 27, 1730. to take Possession of the Lands be|tween <HI>St. Croix</HI> River and <HI>Quenebec</HI> River; accordingly a Detachment of 30 Men with an Officer, was made from the four Companies of his Regiment in Garrison at <HI>Canso</HI> in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> was sent to take Possession of that Country, to keep Garrison at <HI>Frederick</HI>'s Fort on <HI>Pemaquid</HI> River, here the Detachment kept for some Time: Upon Appli|cation Home of the <HI>Muscongus</HI> Company, Proprietors in Part of <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> by their indefatigable Agent Mr. <HI>Waldo,</HI> this Instruction was revoked <HI>August</HI> 10, 1732, and

<P>The Claims to Lands in the Territory of <HI>Sagadahoc,</HI> are of various and perplexed Natures, <HI>viz.</HI> Some by old <HI>In|dian</HI> Grants in drunken Frolicks for none or not valuable Considerations; some by Grants from the Council of <HI>Plymouth</HI>; some by Patents from the Governors of <HI>New-York,</HI> when under that Jurisdiction, particularly from Governor <HI>Dungan</HI> a <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Iames</HI> II.</P>

<P>The Grant of the <HI>Province of Main begins at the En|trance of</HI> Piscataqua <HI>Harbour, up the same to</HI> Newichewa|nock <HI>River, and through the same to the furthest Head there|of, and thence North Westward, till</HI> 120 <HI>Miles be finished, and from</HI> Piscataqua <HI>Harbour's Mouth aforesaid, North-Eastward along the Sea-Coast to</HI> Sagadahoc, <HI>and up the River thereof to</HI> Quenebec <HI>River, and through the same to the Head thereof, and thence into the Land North Westward till</HI> 120 <HI>Miles be finished; and from the Period of</HI> 120 <HI>Miles aforesaid, to cross over Land, to the</HI> 120 <HI>Miles before reckoned, up into the Land from</HI> Piscataqua <HI>Harbour through</HI> Newichewanock <HI>River: As also the North half of the</HI> Isles of Shoals.</P>
<P>The Lines of the Territories belonging to the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and of the Province of <HI>New-Hamp|shire,</HI> being in Dispute for many Years: <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> petitioned the King in Council, that their Boundaries with <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> might be determined; accordingl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Consent of the Agents for <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l 9. 1737 <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Charge of passing the Commission was 13, &pound;. 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> a Commission under the great Seal of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>

was issued, appointing five of the eldest Counsel|lors from each of the neighbouring Provinces of <HI>New-York, New Iersies, Nova-Scotia</HI> and <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> (five to be a Coram) as Commissioners, reserving Property and an Appeal to the King in Council: The Appeal was heard before a Committee of Privy Council, March 5th 1739; the Commissioners, and afterwards the King in Council, settled this Line N. 2 d. W. true Course. Ac|cordingly <HI>New-Hampshire ex parte (Massachusetts-Bay</HI> re|fusing to join in the Survey) by Mr. <HI>Bryant</HI> a Surveyor of Lands, settled the Line with the <HI>Province of Main,</HI> viz. From the Mouth of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> River to the Head of <HI>Newichewanock</HI> a little North of <HI>Lovel</HI>'s Pond, upon a great Pond from whence proceeds <HI>Moussum</HI> River, a|bout North-Westerly 40 Miles, thence N. 8 d. E. by Needle (the Commissioners, and as afterwards confirmed by the King in Council, settled this Line N. 2 d. W. true Course) which is by allowing 10 d. Variation; 30 Miles; this Survey was in March, the Snow and Ice melting ren|dred the further Survey Progress impracticable; thus 40 Miles of this Line remains to be run.</P>
<P>Both Governments of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> were in one and the same Person at that Time; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d it was suspected that the Governor favoured <HI>Massa|chusetts-Bay</HI>; therefore the General Assembly of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> brought on a Complaint against the Governor, previous to the Appeals coming on. The Commissioners began to sit <HI>August</HI> 1; the General Assembly of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> was adjourned by the Governor to the 4th of <HI>August,</HI> which retarded them 3 or 4 Days in appointing Managers and giving in their Pleas: The Commission|ers pronounced Judgment <HI>Sept.</HI> 2, the Governor proro|gued the Assembly from <HI>Sept.</HI> 2. to <HI>Oct.</HI> 13, that they might not have an Appeal ready to give into the Com|missioners in six Weeks from Judgment given, the Time limited by the Commission. The Complaint was heard before a Committee of the Council, they found the Com|plaint just, and their Report was approved of by the
<PB N="389" REF="006307_0396_0F652F4915E1BEE0">
in Council. To prevent the like Inconveniencies a se|parate Governor was appointed for <HI>New Hampshire</HI>; and the Governments of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp|shire</HI> have been in two distinct Persons ever since.</P>
<P>TheMethod used before the newCharter by theColony of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Purchase of the Heirs or Assigns of <HI>Gorge,</HI> to convey or dispose of Lands there, was in this Manner, for Instance, <HI>Iuly</HI> 26, 1684. The President of the <HI>Province of Main,</HI> by Order of the General Assembly of the Colony of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> makes a Grant of the Township of <HI>North Yarmouth</HI> to sundry Persons. In a strict Sense the Colony of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> could not ex|er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise any Jurisdiction there, because theHeirs &amp;c. of <HI>Gorg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> could not delegate Jurisdiction; notwithstanding, we find Orders of Jurisdiction signed in <HI>Boston</HI>; for Instance, in the War against the <HI>Indians,</HI> an Order to Sheriffs, Con|stables, &amp;c. to impress Boats and Land Carriages, is signed <HI>Boston,</HI> Sept. 16. 1689, <HI>Thomas Danforth</HI> President of the <HI>Province of Main.</HI></P>
<P>The North and South Lines running inland are 120 Miles, the Front or Sea Line, and the Rear Line may be about 80 Miles; that is the Contents of the <HI>Province of Main</HI> may be about 9600 square Miles; whereof at present granted in Townships or Districts, are only the first or Sea Line consisting of the Townships of <HI>Kittery, York, Wells, Arundel, Biddiford, Scarborough, Falmouth, North Yarmouth, GeorgeTown</HI> or <HI>Arrowsick, Brunswick,</HI> and the Set|tlement of <HI>Topsam</HI>; and a second or inland Line consisting of <HI>Berwick, Philips Town, Naraganset</HI> No. 1. <HI>Naraganset</HI> No. 7. <HI>Marblehead</HI> Township, <HI>Powers</HI> and others Town|ship, and <HI>Cape Anne</HI> Township.</P>
<P>In this Territory of <HI>Main,</HI> there are some private Pur|chases from the <HI>Indians,</HI> which the Proprietor General the Assembly of the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> seem not to dispute; for Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1683 Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> a Mer|chant in <HI>Boston,</HI> purchased of six Sagamores, about 500,000 Acres called the <HI>Pegepscot</HI> Purchase; bounded five Miles West from <HI>Pegepscot</HI> River, by a Line running at
<PB N="390" REF="006307_0397_0F652F4AA9DF44D0">
five Miles Distance parallel with the River, to a certain Fall in said River, and thence N. E. about 44 Miles in a strait Line to <HI>Quenebec</HI> River; it includes the Eastern Di|visions of <HI>Nahumkee</HI> Purchase, and of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Purchase, <HI>Plymouth</HI> Purchase extends 15 Miles each Side of <HI>Quenebec</HI> River. <HI>Wharton</HI> dying insolvent, the Administrator sold this Purchase for not much exceeding 100 &pound;. <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> Currency Anno 1714 to eight or nine Proprietors, viz. <HI>Winthrop, T. Hutchinson, Ruck, Noyes, Watts, Minot, Mountford,</HI> &amp;c: It is bounded S. Westerly by <HI>North-Yarmouth,</HI> which takes in a small Part of this Grant at small Point; <HI>George-Town, Brunswick</HI> and <HI>Topsam</HI> are in this Grant.</P>
<P>At the breaking out of the <HI>French</HI> War, in the Pro|vince of <HI>Main</HI> were Militia or fencible Men 2485.

<P>For some Time during the old Charter of <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> Colony they extended their Claim to 3 Miles North of the Northernmost Part of <HI>Merimack</HI> River, called <HI>En|dicots Tree,</HI> near the Crotch or Fork where <HI>Pemagawaset</HI> River, and the Wares or Discharge of <HI>Winipisiakit</HI> Pond or Lake do meet, and from thence extended their due East and W.

<P><HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> are two the most considera|ble Elements of <HI>History.</HI> The most essential and invaria|ble Things in the <HI>Geography</HI> of a Country, are its general Position upon the Surface of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rth as to Latitude and Longitude; the remarkable Mountains and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Hills; the Sea-Coast; and the Runs of Rivers and Rivulets from the inland into the Sea.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Province of Main,</HI> the remarkable Mountains and Hills are, 1.

The <HI>Pigwoket</HI> Hills at a small Distance from the <HI>WhiteHills,</HI> are much inferior to them, and scarce require to be mention'd. 3. <HI>AquamanticusHills</HI> well known amongst our Sailors, are in the Township of <HI>York</HI> about 8 Miles inland; it is a noted and useful Land-making, for Vessels that fall in Northward of <HI>Boston</HI> or <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Sea-Coast, <HI>Casco-Bay</HI> is a large, good, and safe Harbour or Road for Vessels of any Burden; being shelter'd or cover'd by many Islands: Here some of the Contract Mast Ships take in their Load. Along this Coast are many Harbours commodious for small Craft in loading of Lumber and Fire-Wood for <HI>Boston.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="395" REF="006307_0402_0F652F4FD87DBAC8">Some <HI>English</HI> Puritans belonging to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI>'s Church in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Leyden</HI> to this Day, an English Presbyterian Congregation is maintain'd in their Works by the States.</NOTE> in <HI>Holland,</HI> with some of their Friends in <HI>England,</HI> obtain'd of the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> an in|distinct imperfect Grant of Lands in <HI>North-America</HI>; their Design wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for <HI>Hudson's</HI> River, but falling in with <HI>Cape Cod</HI> late in the Year <HI>Nov.</HI> 11, they were obliged to winter there, and in a shallow Bay and poor Soil within the Great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> they sit down and call it <HI>New-Plymouth,</HI> in Remembrance of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> from whence they took their Departure.</P>
<P>They had no particular Grant from the Council of <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> of the Country where they settled, until 1624; and this was so indistinct, that they obtained a newGrant 1629, but still so obscure as not to be understood at present, as appear'd at a hearing 1741, before Commissioners ap|pointed by the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to settle their Line with the Colony of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI></P>
<P>We shall only briefly observe that Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> the Traveller, with two Ships 1614 made a good Voyage upon these Coasts, and by his Means the Country was named <HI>New-England</HI> by the Court of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1616 four or five Sail of fishing Vessels from <HI>London,</HI> and as many from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> make good Fares of Fish.</P>
<P>Anno 1618 only two Sail from <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>England</HI> fish upon the Coast of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1619 only one Ship of 200 Tuns, made a good Voyage.</P>
<P>Anno 1621, ten or twelve Ships from the West of <HI>England,</HI> fish upon the Coast of <HI>New England,</HI> and make good Voyages with their Fish to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1622 there were upon the Coast of <HI>New-England</HI> 35 Vessels from the West of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1623 Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> writes, that there were for that Year 40 Sail from <HI>England,</HI> fishing upon the Coast of <HI>New

England.</HI> That <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> in six Years last past, had shipt off 20,000 Beaver-Skins.</P>
<P>After some Time, a Number of People from <HI>New Ply|mouth,</HI> purchased of the <HI>Indians,</HI> a Parcel of Land called <HI>Nosset</HI> near <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> and gave it the Name of <HI>Eastham</HI>; their Purchase upon this narrow Promontory reach'd a|bout 30 Miles from North to South. The first two Years, they liv'd without any Supply from <HI>England,</HI> clear|ed and planted 60 Acres with Indian Corn.

<P>Next <HI>Richard Trent</HI> was unanimously elected, until their Charter was dropt or superseded.</P>
<P>I find that upon the <HI>Revolution,</HI> the Commander in chief of <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony is called <HI>President,</HI> not Gover|nor: Thus Major <HI>Church's</HI> Commission from <HI>Plymouth</HI> to go against the Eastern <HI>Indians</HI> is signed <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. 1689, <HI>Thomas Hinkley,</HI> President.</P>
<P>N. B. At first this Colony was only a voluntary Asso|ciation; in the Beginning the Governor had only one As|sistant, afterwards three, and sometime after five, at length <HI>Anno</HI> 1637 they chose 7 Assistants.</P>
<P>As the Boundaries by their Grant were ill determined, there were continual Disputes between this Colony and that of <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> By a Commission from <HI>Charles</HI> II. 1664 to Col. <HI>Richard Nichols,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Carr, George Cartwright,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Maverick</HI>; to determine Contro|versies, concerning several Boundaries in the Continent of <HI>North-America</HI>; they passed Judgment concerning the Boundaries between <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony; as it was only by Way of Amusement to quiet the Mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the People in these Colonies, and never confirmed by the King in Council; it had no Effect.</P>
<P>Ever since the Colony of <HI>Plymouth</HI> has been annexed to the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> those Disputes have continued or been revived from Time to Time; the chief Dispute was concerning <HI>Attleborough</HI> Gore, which if <HI>Mas|sachusetts-Bay</HI> had quitclaim'd to them, <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> would have given a general Quit-Claim in all other Concerns; and prevented the Loss of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and some Part of <HI>Bar|rington, Swanzey, Tiverton,</HI> and <HI>Little Compton</HI>; but the Influence of a few ill-natured, obstinate, inconsiderateMen, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here we may observe the pernicious Consequence of blindly fol|lowing the Dictates of inconsiderate, imprudent, clamorous or violent leading Men.</NOTE>

<P>The Determination of the Commissioners <HI>Anno</HI> 1741 was by the King in Council 1746 confirmed as final.

<P>Upon the Restoration 1661 <HI>Gorge</HI> and <HI>Mason</HI>'s Repre|sentatives, renewed their Complaints against <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Colony, upon Account of Encroachments; it was chiefly in Compassion that these Eastern People were (as abandoned) taken under their Protection and Jurisdiction, but moreover, <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Colony conceived, that it might keep up their Claim, to the most Northerly Part of <HI>Merimack</HI> River with three Miles Advantage, and E. and W. from Sea to Sea, including all the settled Part of <HI>Mason</HI>'s Grant or <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> and of the Province of <HI>Main</HI> to <HI>Black Point.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE 6. Concerning the present Territories as united by the Name of the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS we before hinted by a Charter <HI>October</HI> 7. 1691, sundry Territories, under several Grants and Jurisdic|tions, for their better Accommodation and Conveniencies,
<PB N="465" REF="006307_0472_0F652F899F0515F8">
were united by Charter into one Property and Jurisdiction, that is, into one General Assembly.</P>
<P>The Bill for restoring the <HI>New-England</HI> Charters be|ing dropt by the Dissolution of the Revolution-Conven|tion-Parliament; the <HI>New-England</HI> Agents were puzzled, whether, to stand a Trial at Law, by a Writ of <HI>Error</HI> for reversing the Judgments against the old Charters, or to accept of a Draught of a new Charter; at length they acquiesced in the King's Pleasure, and the King directed a new Charter.</P>
<P>The Nature of this Union of several Colonies into one Jurisdiction, the new Charter with a subsequent explana|tory Charter, and sundry other general Affairs, have been by Way of Anticipation already narrated, see P. 374, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the general Account of <HI>British North-America,</HI> we omitted the Post-Office, a very beneficial Institution; and as the present Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> is its most considerable Branch, here it may naturally take Place.</P>
<P>The Post-Office in <HI>England</HI> was settled by Act of Par|liament 12 <HI>Carol.</HI> II. In the Beginning of this present Century Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>New-Iersies</HI> projected a Post-Office for <HI>British North-Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rica,</HI> this he effected and ob|tained a Patent for the Management and Profits of the same, this Patent he afterwards sold to the Crown, and a few Years after the Union, the Posts of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland</HI> and <HI>America</HI> were put under one Director by Act of Parliament 9 <HI>Anne</HI>; constituting one Post-Master-Ge|neral for all the <HI>British</HI> Dominions; to keep a General-Post-Office in <HI>London,</HI> the Post-Master-General may keep one Letter-Office in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> another in <HI>Dublin,</HI> ano|ther at <HI>New York,</HI> and other chief Offices at convenient Places in <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>Leeward Islands,</HI> and appoint Deputies for managing the particular Rates for the Post|age of Letters in the Plantations; requires too much Room for a Summary, it is refer'd to Stat. 9 <HI>Annae</HI> Cap. 10. We shall only relate; that all Letters from on board any Ship, shall be delivered to the Deputy Post-Master of the Place, Penalty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &pound;. Sterl. for every Offence; the Post-Maste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

paying to the Deliverer One Penny Sterl. per Letter. N. B. This Clause is not much attended to, because the Act exempts Merchants Letters, and those of Masters of Ships, so as such Letters be delivered to the Persons to whom they are directed without receiving any Profit for them: And any Letters sent by private Friends, or by any Mes|senger about private Affairs or Business.</P>
<P>From <HI>Piscataqua</HI> or <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is a re|gular Postage, from thence to <HI>Williamsburg</HI> is uncertain, because the Post does not proceed until Letters are lodg|ed, sufficient to pay the Charge of the Post-Riders: From <HI>Williamsburg</HI> in <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Charles-Town</HI> in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> the Post-Carriage is still more uncertain.</P>
<P>There is a Deputy Post-Master-General for <HI>America</HI> appointed by the Post-Master-General in <HI>London; New-York</HI> is appointed for his Official Residence, but by Con|nivance he resides any where, <HI>v. g.</HI> at present in <HI>Virginia Elliot Benger,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> formerly Mr. <HI>Loydd</HI> in <HI>South Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Here it properly belongs to give an Account of the general and frequented travelling Roads from <HI>Penobscot</HI> Bay N. Lat. 44 d. 30 m. (further North is Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Property and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> no travellingRoads) toSt. <HI>Iuan</HI> or <HI>St. Iohn</HI>'s River in <HI>Florida,</HI> N. Lat. 31 d. this by an Agreement with <HI>Spain</HI> Anno 1738 is the Termination of our Property or Claim in <HI>Florida</HI>: This is 40 Miles N. of <HI>St. Augustin</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from <HI>St. Au|gustin</HI> there is a Land Communication to <HI>Moville,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Missisippi</HI>; these belong to the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which properly do not belong to our History.</P>
<P>We shall begin at <HI>St. Georges</HI> Fort and Block-House upon <HI>St. Georges</HI> River, a few Miles S. W. of <HI>Penobscot</HI> Bay; from thence

<HEAD><HI>&sect;. I.</HI> Concerning the <HI>Civil Administration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Administration may be divided into the legislative supreme Court, called the <HI>General Court</HI> or <HI>General As|sembly</HI> of the Province; and the subordinate <HI>executive</HI> Courts.</P>
<P>The Great and General Court or Provincial Assembly, consists of <HI>three Negatives,</HI> viz. the Governor, the Coun|cil, and House of Representatives.</P>
<P>The Governor is by Patent or Commission from the King <HI>durante beneplacito,</HI> with a Book of Instructions; which Instructions though binding to the Governor (fre|quently broke in upon by some Governors) are not so to the House of Representatives, as they have from Time to Time represented to the Governor; for Instance, one of the Instructions requires a Sallary of <HI>One Thousand Pounds</HI> Sterl. <HI>per Annum,</HI> to be settled upon the Gover|nour; this is always obstinately refused, but are willing to grant him a yearly Support, sutable to the Dignity of his Excellency, and consistent with the Ability of the People their Constituents, of which it may be supposed they only are the proper Judges.</P>
<P>The military Government by Sea and Land, is sole in the King's Governors; they grant all Commissions in the Militia, which gives the Governors a vast Influence; Peo|ple in the Plantations are readily bribed by distinguishing Titles.&mdash;
The Governors in the Plantations have that con|siderable Power of negativing or suspending Counsellors without assigning Reasons; Governor <HI>Belcher</HI> at one Time negatived 13 Councellors in the pernicious Land-Bank Interest; this Management of Mr. <HI>Belcher</HI>'s was in a high Manner approved of by the passing an Act of the British Parliament soon after; this Land-Bank is de|signed in the Words of the Act "mischievous Under|takings in <HI>America,</HI> and unlawful Undertakings;" but so it is, that this Act of Parliament is not fully put in Ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cution at this Day <HI>Christmas</HI> 1748.
They nominate <HI>Duran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o beneplacito</HI> all Judges, Justices and Sheriffs, which
<PB N="473" REF="006307_0480_0F652F8F97450418">
being, with the Militia Officers of the several Townships, a great Majority in the lower House, gives the Governor a very great Influence there: the Power of negativing the Members of the upper House makes his Influence there so considerable, that he has in a great Measure two <HI>Ne|gatives</HI> in the Legislature; the King at Home cannot <HI>negative</HI> or suspend any Member of the upper House cal|led the House of Lords.</P>
<P>The Governor has the Opportunity of recommending to the House, Agents or Provincial Attorneys, his Friends or Creatures; to manage their Affairs and his own at the Court and Boards in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and to procure for them handsome Gratuities: For Instance, the Governor in a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssage to the Assembly, <HI>March</HI> 16. 1743, 4, re|commends a generous Allowance to Mr. <HI>Kilby,</HI> he hav|ing served the Province upon particular Orders of this Court, with great Industry, Faithfulness and Success. A Governor by frequent and long. Speeches and Messages to the House of Representatives (sometimes near one half of the Journal or Votes of the House of Representatives consists of these Speeches and Messages) seems to act as a Member of that House, or rather as the Speaker or Orator (a <HI>French</HI> Expression) of the House; sometimes Governors proceed further, for Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1744 the Governor desires of the House of Representatives; that in the Recess of the General Assembly (which must be short Intervals, because of late Years the General Assem|bly at a great Charge to the Province have had very frequent and long Sittings) upon any sudden Emergency, the Governor and his Council may be impowered to draw upon the Treasurer. The Governor has a Negative not only in all Bills of Assembly, but also in all their Electi|ons, that of a Speaker not excepted.</P>
<P>Thus the Governor commissions all Militia, and other military Officers, independently of the Council or As|sembly; he nominates all Civil Officers, excepting those concerned in the <HI>Finances</HI> or Money-Affairs, and with Consent of the Council, they are accordingly appointed&punc;
<PB N="474" REF="006307_0481_0F652F904DF75140">
He calls, dissolves, prorogues, adjourns, removes, and o|therways harrasses the General Assembly at Pleasure; he frequently refuses his Assent to Bills, Resolves, and Or|ders of the General Court; whereas our Sovereign in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> excepting upon very extraordinary Occa|sions, does not exert this Prerogative; thus we see a de|legated Power assuming more than the sovereign consti|tuent Authority chuses to venture upon.</P>

In Time of War there are Fees for grant|ing Letters of Mart or Mark to private Men of War called Privateers, and many Emoluments arising from multiplied Expeditions.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding of this great Authority, a Governor's Station is very slippery; upon frivolous and sometimes false Complaints he is liable to be called to Account, <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|perceded</HI> by some Expectant at Court, and if the Male-Administration is notorious, he is also <HI>mulcted.</HI></P>
<P>By Charter the Governor cannot impress Men into the military Service, to march out of the Province, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an Act or Resolve of the General Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; the Governor by his 11th Instruction, is not to give his Assent to any Act for repealing any of the standing Laws of the Pro|vince, without a suspending Clause, that is, until a Copy thereof, be transmitted and laid before the King.

Upon the breaking out of the Indian War 1688, he sollicited an Expedition against <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> May 1690, and had good Success against the <HI>French</HI>; but his subsequent Expedition in Autumn, against <HI>Canada</HI> the same Year was disasterous, as has been already narrated, and in the Words of Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> "though used to div|ing for <HI>Plate,</HI> this was an Affair too deep for him to dive

into," amongst other bad Consequences of this ill-con|trived and worse managed <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition, was the introducing of a pernicious, fraudulent <HI>Paper-Currency,</HI> or Bills of publick Credit, to pay the Charges or Debt incurr'd;
the Operation of this injurious Currency is such that all personal Estates (Specialities excepted) are reduc'd to One for Eight, reckoning by heavy Pieces of Eight (or seven Eights of an Ounce of Silver) at 6 <HI>s.</HI>;
the Loss of Men was of very bad Consequence to an Infant Colony, which was not by the Enemy, but by a Camp Fever, the Small-Pox, and Disasters in returning Home, notwithstanding, as Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> expresses it, "the Wheel of Prayer for them in <HI>New-England</HI> was kept constantly going round."
Soon after his Return to <HI>Boston</HI> he went for <HI>London</HI> to petition the Court of <HI>England</HI> (notwith|standing of former Disasters, and his own Incapacity to manage the Affair) to encourage another Expedition a|gainst <HI>Canada.</HI> Upon obtaining of a new Charter dated <HI>Oct.</HI> 7. 1691, at the Desire of the <HI>New England</HI> Agents Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> was appointed Governor of the Pro|vince of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> and Territories thereto belong|ing; he arrived with the new Charter <HI>May</HI> 14. 1692; and <HI>Iune</HI> 8, the Assembly under the new Charter met for the first Time.

<P>All numerous Combinations, Associations, or Partnerships in an ab|solute Sovereignty, or depending Provinces, tend to the Subversion, Ruin, or at least, Confusion of the Society; we have a notorious In|stance of this in the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> of <HI>New-England.</HI> Anno 1740, a Combination of DESPERATE DEBTORS, by the Bubble Name of <HI>Land Bank,</HI> had formed a prevailing Party, which not|withstanding of their being timely stigmatized and damned by an Act of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament, their Influence in the Assembly continues to prevail to this Time 1749; in a lucid Interval <HI>Anno</HI> 1746, Journal P. 246, the House of Representatives, say, "We have been the Means of effectually bringing Distress, if not Ruin upon our selves.

&mdash;The Forces, particularly upon the Eastern Fron|tiers, have been very negligent in <HI>scouting,</HI> and all other military Services; there have been many <HI>Ineffectives,</HI> In|habitants of several Townships; to do Duty in their own Townships, have been inlisted, paid, and victualled, though they only followed their own private Business, "this is very abusive to the Government, as well as in|jurious to these exposed Parts."
&mdash; 1747,
The Assembly represent "the Husbandry, Manufactures, and Naviga|tion of the Province; have suffered much by multiplied Expeditions."
&mdash; "We have by our past Actions proved our selves <HI>zealous</HI> for his <HI>Majesty's Service</HI>; but our Un|happiness is, that although the same Disposition remains, yet we are in a Manner <HI>incapacitated</HI> to promote it for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="006307_0504_0F652F099057DE50">The House of Representatives frequently complain of their being involved in unnecessary and improper Charges. 1747 <HI>April</HI> 21.

That <HI>long Sessions</HI> are very expensive to the Pro|vince. 2. He entreats them to keep the Province <HI>clear of Debt,</HI> which instead of decreasing, will continually increase their Incum|brances&mdash; 3. 1741 <HI>August</HI> 17, in his first Speech,
"A Creditor who has the Misfortune of having an out standing Debt, of the Value of 1000 &pound;. Sterl. contracted <HI>Anno</HI> 1730, can now receive no more in our Courts of Judicature (unless in a Case of Specialty) than the Va|lue of about 650 &pound;.

"<HI>Restraints</HI> upon Emissions, which his Majesty has been <HI>graciously pleased,</HI> out of his Paternal Affection to his People to do, and has thereby saved this Pro|vince from <HI>greater Ruin</HI>"&mdash;
"It is the <HI>Injustice</HI> of those Bills, which has plunged us into those <HI>Difficulties</HI>&mdash; in some subsequent Assemblies
"the securing to every Creditor, the <HI>just Value</HI> of his Debt, is a Piece of Justice, hitherto <HI>unknown</HI> to <HI>your Laws</HI> or Courts of Judicature"&mdash; 5.
"The Province being so long acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stomed, to estimate Province Bills of publick Credit, according to their <HI>nominal Value,</HI> is grown quite insensible of their <HI>real Value,</HI>"&mdash; 1744 <HI>Nov.</HI> 29, he well observes in his Speech with Regard to multiplying Paper Currency, "and can such a Proceeding be thought beneficial to the Country?
Can it possi|bly be deemed either <HI>prudent</HI> with Respect to yourselves, or <HI>just</HI> with Regard to <HI>your Posterity.</HI>&mdash; 1747, 8, <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. "the <HI>general Distress</HI> of the Province, arising from the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Emissions of Paper Mo|ney, whereby the Value thereof, for all Occasions of Life, is <HI>sunk so low,</HI> and is still sinking; and thereby the <HI>Estates of Orphans</HI> and <HI>Widows,</HI> and of many others who have no Remedy in their Power, against this <HI>growing Evil,</HI> daily diminishing; which must in very little Time bring many <HI>good Families</HI> to <HI>Ruin.</HI>"</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Question; we may observe, that, 1. Of late Years, the Sessions of Assembly, are <HI>longer</HI> and <HI>more frequent,</HI> than ever; for Instance, the annual Assembly of 1746, did sit about 30 Weeks at the daily Charge (our Assembly-Men are all in Pay) of near 150 &pound;. 2. Our Provincial Debt 1741, when Mr. <HI>Belcher</HI> was superseded, was about 130,000 &pound;.; at present 1749, it is about <HI>two Millions.</HI>&mdash;3.
"The <HI>great</HI> and <HI>sudden</HI> Depreciations of Province-Bills, is owing to the immoderate Price of Exchange and Silver&mdash; 4. <HI>Ian.</HI> 15. 1741, 2,
" The Instruction, containing a restraining Clause in e|mitting Bills of Credit, is remitted: As this is an Alteration, which I am perswaded (Speech to the Assembly) will be <HI>very agreeable</HI> unto you, and has been occasioned through my Accession to the Govern|ment; I mention it to you with no SMALL SATISFACTION.&mdash; 5.
In a Speech to the Assembly, "from 1718 to 1743, in constant Practice all Debts upon Book, Note, Bond, or Mortgage, were discharged in Province Bills Penny for Penny, that is, in the <HI>nominal Sum</HI>; which he deems to be equitable, because both Creditor and Debtor, tacitly run the Chance of the rising or falling of those Bills."
<HI>N. B.</HI> This was the <HI>common Cant</HI> of the <HI>Land Bank Managers</HI> and <HI>other Debtors</HI>; the Forbearance and Indulgence of Creditors is ridiculed, as much, as if a Person intrusted by another with Money or Goods, should turn <HI>Bankrupt</HI> and laugh at his Friend for his Trust, alledging, that it was in his Option, to trust or not trust him. How provoking is this, to an honest Man, for his Good Nature and Compassion to have his Es|tate first by a <HI>private,</HI> and afterwards by a <HI>more open</HI> and <HI>daring Com|bination</HI> of the Debtors reduced in a reverse Proportion of 12 <HI>s.</HI> to 30 <HI>s.</HI> the Price of Silver from <HI>Anno</HI> 1718 to 1743, and from 30 <HI>s.</HI> to 60 <HI>s.</HI> as it is <HI>Anno</HI> 1749; and afterwards be laughed at as a silly Fool.</P>
<P>And in Fact, how could a Person remedy himself with the strictest Sagacity in the following Cases? A Man lets out Money upon Mort|gage <HI>May</HI> 1745, Exchange with <HI>London</HI> 650 &pound;. Currency for 100 &pound;. Sterl&punc;; in the Space of three Years <HI>May</HI> 1748, Exchange is 1100 &pound;. Currency for 100 &pound;. Sterl.: A Creditor all this Time cannot recover his Money, because by the Laws of the Province, near one Year (by Appeals and Reviews) is required to bring a Bond to final Judgment, and the Equity of Redemption is three Years more: Moreover, the publick Loans and the private Bank Loans were conditioned at 10 to 15 Years Forbearance, which with the abovesaid four Years additional; makes an unavoidable Forbearance of 14 to 19 Years: Further, some of the Loan 1716 (a great Damage to the Publick) is not sued out at this present Writing. How is it possible to provide against the conti|nued great Depreciations during so many Years?</P>
<P>As it does not belong to any Provincial Assembly, to explain Acts of Parliament; because they may be deemed sufficient to execute themselves, under the Agency of the Colony executive Courts; I do not pretend to be Statesman sufficient, to account for a Bill brought into our Court of Legislature yearly, for these eight Years last past; entitled, <HI>A Bill for the more speedy finishing of the Land-Bank Scheme</HI>; as it is never brought to an Issue, perhaps some may call it, rather a <HI>Bill of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> in his Speech <HI>October</HI> 14. 1741,
"Nothing is <HI>more easy,</HI> than to secure to <HI>every Creditor</HI> his <HI>just Due,</HI> let the Bills de|preciate never so much, by enabling the King's Judges to do Justice to every Creditor in that Particular&mdash; It is the <HI>Injustice</HI> of our Bills which has plunged us into these <HI>Difficulties.</HI>"
But as this Advice has not been followed or repeated, the Creditors have generally suffered in the reverse Proportion of 60 to 30 in a few Years; such is the ma|lignant Nature of this <HI>depascent Ulcer,</HI> that nothing but the Extirpation or Excision of this, can save our Body Politick; <HI>delenda est.</HI></P>
<P>I desire Readers, not affected with Paper-Currencies, may excuse Prolixity; when this <HI>vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chimaera</HI> or <HI>Monster</HI> comes in my Way, I cannot contain my self.</P>
<P>This Scheme for <HI>fraudulent Debtors</HI> to cheat their Creditors, was first projected <HI>Anno</HI> 1714, by <HI>I. C.</HI> The Maxim or Basis was by multiplied Emissions to depreciate the nominal Value of our Currency; thus the Difference between the nominal Value, at any Time when paid, and its real Value when lent or contracted for; was a fraudulent Gain to the Debtor, and a very injurious Loss to the honest Creditor; for Instance, <HI>Anno</HI> 1713, Exchange with <HI>London</HI> 150 &pound;. Currency for 100 &pound;. Sterl.; at present 1749, by Depreciations we are at 1100 &pound;. Currency for 100 &pound;. Sterl.; that is in successive Dealings, the Cre|ditor has lost six in seven of his Debts or Contracts, which is the Deb|tor's crafty Gain. There were various Essays made from Time to Time, to arrive to this Depreciation, the last was <HI>miraculously</HI> the most successful. 1. Emitting Bills of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blick Credit, not only for the or|dinary and necessary Charges of Government, but for publick Loans to private Persons, <HI>viz.</HI> Anno 1714. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 &pound;. Anno 1716, 100,000 &pound;. Anno 1721, 50,000 &pound;. Anno 1727, 60,000 &pound;. at long Credit, this had a considerable Effect in Favour of Debtors, but some Inconveni|encies and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ions put a Stop to it. 2. Postponing the cancelling of Emissions; thus Emissions yearly multiplied, and the cancelling of them delayed, increased this Flood of a base Currency. 3. Notes of private Associations designed to be upon a Par, current with publick Bills of Credit, would have multiplied this false Currency immensly, but from private Complaints sent Home, this was crushed in <HI>Embrio,</HI> by Act of the <HI>British</HI> Parliament 1741. 4. At length by multiplied expensive Expeditions, they compassed their Designs to the greatest Extent, or to a <HI>ne plus Ultra,</HI> which it is to be hoped the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in their wonted Goodness, will rectify in their present Session.</P>
<P>I am sorry that upon any Occasion, or in any Respect; I should give Offence to any particular Person, or to any Number of Men: It is not from Malice or Resentment: It cannot be imagined, that in Course, writing unavoidable historical Truths, I should designedly and maliciously reflect upon the Country and its municipal Jurisdiction; this is my <HI>Altera Patria,</HI> from upwards of thirty Years Residence.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Creatures</HI> of any Ministry at Home, may from Time to Time find Fault with the <HI>Liberty of the Fress,</HI> which they represent as licentious; the Courts of Judicature, which by good Providence a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e independent of the Ministry, vindicate the Press, if not too licentious, and find Fault with their despotick Accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</P>
<P>While I write meer Facts with proper Vouchers and in a good Light; I use only that Liberty (not Licentiousness) of the Press, which seems sacred and essential to the <HI>British</HI> Constitution; as we have no general Intendants as in the <HI>French</HI> Constitution, every His|torical Writer with us, may be a So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">endant</HI> or <HI>Check</HI> upon <HI>Provincial Administration</HI>; for Instance, as the House of Representa|tives, are the grand Inquest of the Province, especially as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">isde|meanors in the Administration: May I not take Hint from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir Journals, <HI>v. g.</HI> Although as above the Colony of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ecticut</HI> are to this Province as two to three; <HI>Connecticut</HI> is almost out of Debt, and we are about two Millions Currency in Debt; the annual publick Charges of <HI>Connecticut</HI> are 4000 to 5000 &pound;. Currency, those of <HI>Mas|sachusetts-Bay</HI> are about 400,000 &pound;.: Which vast proportional Dif|ference, is said to be <HI>owing to the Differences in the Frugality and In|tegrity of their respective Administrations.</HI> 2. The Representatives in their Journals seem to complain of universal infectious Corruption, viz. That Officers from the highest to the lowest, were iniqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> in their Perquisites: The Field-Officers, Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and others were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om|plained against for extorting Money from the private Men, as a Com|mission of receiving their Wages, and for certifying their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Service; for buying their Wages or Pay at a great Discount; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Money in the Discharge or Exchange of impressed Men; and for false incomplete Muster-Rolls:
These Things are all wisely provided against by the General Assembly, but the executive Part of the Ad|ministration seem to connive; for Instance, by a late Act "if any Person authorized, shall exact or take any Reward, to discharge or spare any (Soldiers) from said Service, he shall forfeit <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> for every <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> he shall so exact or take:"
In this Case many Officers have been notoriously guilty, but not called to Account.</P>
<P>The whole Legislature, for Reasons best known to themselves, do at Times jointly vary from their former Notions of Affairs: A noted Instance of this was <HI>Anno</HI> 1741, a Sum of 127.125 &pound;. in publick Bills of Credit to be cancelled by Taxes, conform to the emitting Acts of Assembly; so high a Tax was judged inconvenient, and it was di|vided amongst the three subsequent Years: <HI>Anno</HI> 1748 the Province poorer by Expedition Losses of working Men, and by Ship building, and other Articles of Trade failing, the Province Tax for the Year is enacted, at upwards of 400,000 &pound;.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Anno 1731 Some Townships were taken from the Counties of <HI>Suffolk, Middlesex,</HI> and <HI>Hampshire</HI>; and formed into a new County called the County of <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>As this History seems to swell too much for the Pe|rusal of the People in our Infant Colonies, who in general are not <HI>Bookish,</HI> and do not apply themselves to read Books of any considerable Bulk; I must forbear insert|ing the long List of the Townships in <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Province.</P>
<P>We shall here only observe, that our Townships or Districts of Land, may be distinguished into four Sorts. 1. Incorporated Townships which are served with Pre|cepts, and generally send Representatives, this Year they are in Number 95. 2. Incorporated Townships, which are served with Precepts, but generally do not send Re|presentatives, this present Year they are 58; their Num|ber being so large, is occasioned by their Poverty, which proceeds from their labouring young Men being taken away, that is, <HI>depopulated</HI> by <HI>multiplied Expeditions,</HI> and their being <HI>peculated</HI> by <HI>multiplied Taxes</HI>; formerly our Province Tax was from <HI>Six Thousand</HI> to (in great Exi|gencies)
<PB N="504" REF="006307_0511_0F652F0E92FE1F20">
<HI>Forty Thousand Pound</HI> per Ann; whereas this pre|sent Year 1748 the Provincial Tax upon Polls and Estates is <HI>Three Hundred seventy-seven Thousand nine Hundred ninety two Pounds,</HI> and Excises doubled; thus they cannot well spare 30 <HI>s.</HI> a Day the present Wages of aRepresentative. 3. Townships incorporated, but in express Words debarred from sendingRepresentatives; these are but few inNumber, because lately introduced; this seems <HI>Anti-Constitutional,</HI> that (as we have no County Representatives) Persons of good Estates real and personal should in no manner be represented, as if they were Aliens, Servants or Slaves. 4. Townships or Districts granted to a Number of Pro|prietors, but as the Conditions of the Grant, particularly the settling of a certain Number of Families in a limited Space of Time, are not fully performed, they are not as yet qualified to be constituted, by Act of Assembly, with all Town Privileges; of those there are many, especially in those Lands which lately were taken from the Pro|vince of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> and annexed to the Crown in Property, and to the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in Ju|risdiction. N. B. This late Boundary Line cut off from <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Province, the constituted, but not re|presented Townships of <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Litchfield</HI> upon <HI>Merimack</HI> River; of <HI>Winchester</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> River; with Part of the constituted Townships of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Dunstable</HI> upon <HI>Merimack</HI> River; Part of <HI>Groton,</HI> and <HI>Townshe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d,</HI> Part of <HI>Northfield</HI> upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> River: the other Districts or Grants not incorporated anne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> were, <HI>Herrys</HI> Town, <HI>Contacook,</HI> the nine Townships commonly called the Double Row of Fron|tier Towns against the French and their Indian Auxilia|ries, the Row of four Townships upon the East Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, the Row of two Townships West Side of <HI>Connecticut</HI> River,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About 20 Years since, and for some following Years, the Gene|ral Assembly of the Province were in the Humour of dividing and appropriating most of the then reckoned Provincial or unoccupied Lands; that in Case of future Claims by the Crown, &amp;c. by Posses|sion they might retain at least the Property: This was provident and good Policy, and accordingly upon settling the Line between the two Provinces, the Property of the abovesaid Districts, was in the Commission reserved to these Possessors; but lately the Heirs and Assigns of Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> original Grantee of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> have in|timidated the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Proprietors, and brought sundry of them to compound for a valuable Quit-Claim, whereas if by Contribution of the present Proprietors (a meer Trifle to each of them) they by Petition had carried the Affair before the King in Council, they would have been quieted in their Property, and obviated any further Claims, such as the Claims of Col. <HI>Allen</HI>'s Heirs, Mr. <HI>Mason</HI>'s general Assignee; and of the Claims of the Million Purchase lately revived, which may likewise be converted into Bubbles.</P>
<P>Our General Assembly at that Time were in such a Hurry to ap|propriate the vacant Lands, that several old Townships were encou|raged to petition for an additional new Township; and when they were satiated, the Assembly introduced by Way of Bounty to the Descendents of the Soldiers in the <HI>Indian</HI> War of King <HI>Philip</HI> (so called) 1675, and of the Soldiers in Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI>'s Expedition against <HI>Canada,</HI> Anno 1690; thus nine Townships were granted to each of these Expeditions: Thus no Lands (excepting in the inland back Wilderness of the Province of <HI>Main</HI>) were left to recompence the Descendents of the particular Sufferers (the Province in general was an unaccountable Sufferer) in the unforeseen and inconceivable (because rash) Expedition against <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> our Administration per|haps did not understand the Doctrine of Chances; but by good Pro|vidence, though the Chance was upwards of a Million to One against us, we gained the Prize, not by playing away Men (as is the Phrase in <HI>Flanders</HI>) in being killed, but by the <HI>Poltroonery</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> Garrison; this must not be understood as detracting from the <HI>New-England</HI> Militia Troops, who are noted for their Courage as <HI>Bull-Dogs</HI> (excuse the Expression) where they fix, they never quit hold, un|til they conquer, or are cut to Pieces.</P></NOTE> <HI>Canada</HI> to <HI>Gallop</HI> and others,

<P>The Affair of the above Townships is variable, and of no permanent Use, but this may serve a future curious Historian, as an accurate Account for the State of the Year 1749.</P>
<P>There are a few Things, in which the House of Re|presentatives of the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New England</HI> (which in all Respects is the principal <HI>British</HI> Co|lony) do vary from the Practice of the House of Com|mons in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> I shall mention two, which must not be deemed constitutional, as being only by sundry Acts of the General Assembly, and consequently if in|convenient, may be repealed or altered by some subse|quent Act.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That a Representative must be a</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It is said, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1693, there were some <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlemen Representatives for some of the Out-Towns, but not agreeable to the then Rev. <HI>I.

<PB N="507" REF="006307_0514_0F652F10D1E9D890">
a Gentleman of good natural Interest and Resident in the Province, a Man of Reading, Observation, and daily con|versant with Affairs of Policy and Commerce, is certainly better qualified for a Legislator, than a Retailer of Rum and small Beer called a Tavern-Keeper, in a poor obscure Country Town, remote from all Business; thus this Countryman will not be diverted from the most necessary and beneficial Labour of cultivating the Ground, his pro|per Qualification; to attend State-Affairs, of which he may be supposed grosly and invincibly ignorant; thus the poor Township, by Gentlemen at large <HI>serving gratis</HI> or <HI>generously</HI> as the Quota of the Township, will be freed from the growing (in one Year from <HI>Anno</HI> 1747 to 1748 this Charge was advanced from 20 <HI>s.</HI> to 30 <HI>s.</HI> per Day) Charge of subsisting an useless Representative: There|fore, if this Clause of Residence in the Act of Assembly 1693, is not absolutely repealed, may it not be qualified in this Manner? <HI>viz.</HI> The Representative if not a Re|sident in the Township, being a Resident in the Province, shall have a Rent Roll of **** <HI>per Annum</HI> in the Place, or shall be the Proprietor of **** Hundred Acres in the Township for which he is elected.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Councellors and Representatives do serve their Country upon Wages.</HI> The <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> of <HI>doing Good,</HI> are Recompence sufficient to a <HI>Patriot,</HI> thus the Province will <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As <HI>Savings,</HI> that is <HI>Frugality</HI> in private Oeconomy is a conside|rable <HI>Lucretian,</HI> so it is in the publick Charges of Government; for Instance, the taking and maintaining the Fort of <HI>Louisbourg</HI> in the Island of <HI>Cape-Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton</HI> cost <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; considering other unavoidable vast Charges, not conveniently able to afford such an extra Charge upon a Place which must in Policy unavoidably be restored, to the great Disgust of the brave <HI>New-England</HI> Men, who in <HI>Loyalty,</HI> and <HI>Patriotism</HI> to the <HI>British</HI> Nations, ventured not only their Lives to the Number upwards of 2000 of an Infant Colony, dead, but their Fortunes, (that is their Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, notwithstanding of the generous Reimbursement of the <HI>British</HI> Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, reduced to great Distress) I say it cost about 500,000 &pound;.

Taxation; for Instance, this present Year 1748, the Province would have saved about 25,000 &pound;.; the whole annual Provincial Charge from the Commencement of the Charter, fell short of this Sum, until <HI>Anno</HI> 1735; that Year, the Rates were 31,000 &pound;.

As the Affair I mean is only temporary, I shall subjoin it amongst the Annotations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is arrogant, in some Measure seditious, and a great Sin against the divine Institution of Society; for any Person or Persons, to ex|claim against the Acts of Legislature: the following are only some private Speculations, concerning the negotiating of the late <HI>Cape-Bre|ton</HI> Expedition Reimbursement Money, and the <HI>sudden Transition</HI> from an immense base Paper-Currency, to that good and universal Medium of Silver Money.</P>
<P N="1">1. The late Act for receiving and negotiating our <HI>Reimbursement</HI> Money granted by the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> impowers Sir <HI>Peter Warren,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bollan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> or two of them, the said <HI>Bollan</HI> to be one; perhaps the giving of a Negative to Mr. <HI>Bollan,</HI> may disgust the other two Gentlemen, so as to prevent their acting, and consequently occasion a further Delay of the <HI>Reimbursement</HI>; did not, Mr. <HI>Bollan</HI>'s being formerly appointed sole Agent in this Affair, disgust his Fellow Provincial Agent Mr. <HI>Kilby,</HI> a Gentleman of Know|ledge and Spirit in transacting of Business; and occasion a Memo|rial of Merchants and others, <HI>Sept.</HI> 21. 1748, to the Treasury of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to delay the Remittance of the <HI>Reimbursement</HI> Money, for Reasons therein specified? This Delay is a Damage to the Coun|try after the Rate (I mean the Interest of the Money) of 11,000 &pound;. Sterl: or 110,000 &pound;. Old Tenor per Annum; as if some Debtors Ma|nagers, studied Methods to delay the <HI>Melioration</HI> of the Denominati|ons of our Currencies, by clogging the Affair.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Amount of our Provincial Debt (that is of our publick Bills, or Paper Currency) <HI>Anno</HI> 1748, was about 2,405,000 &pound;. Old Tenor; by thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct a Part of it 712,000 &pound;. is to be sunk by very heavy Rates upon a reduced poor People, in the Years 1748 and 1749; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">maining 1,693,000 &pound;. Old Tenor, to be redeemed or exchanged by the Reimbursement Silver; Commissions, Freight, Insurance, and some petty Charges being first deducted.</P>
<P>I use the Words, a poor reduced People, 1.
In Conformity to sundry Expressions used at several Times by the House of Represen|tatives, in their Messages to the Governor, "with publick Taxes we are burdened almost to Ruin."&mdash;
"The Province is at a prodigious daily Charge beyond their Strength, which has involved us in a pro|digious Load of Debt, and in a manner exhausted our Substance."&mdash;
"Although the same Disposition remains, yet we are in a manner incapable to promote (the <HI>British</HI> Interest) it for the future."
2. The Loss of about 3000 robust, labouring young Men by Expeditions; Major <HI>Little</HI> lately Commander of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> Reinforce|ments sent to <HI>Annapolis</HI> in <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> in his Book published in <HI>Lon|don</HI> 1748, concerning the Nature of the present Trade of our Nor|thern Colonies, writes, that by multiplied Expeditions they had lost 7000 Men, and many Thousands perverted to Idleness: here I may, by Way of Amusement observe, that according to the Estimates of Political Arithmeticians, in all well settled Countries the Numbers of Males and Females are nearly equal (some are very particular, and suppose 18 Male Births, to 17 Female Births) therefore as we have lately by Expeditions lost about Three Thousand <HI>young Men,</HI> there re|mains with us a Ballance of Three Thousand <HI>young Women,</HI> good Breeders, but idle in that Respect; the Ballance may be transferred to settle <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> under the Cover of some Regiments of Soldiers, that must be disbanded, which in the Interim may be transported to <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> cantoned, and continued in Pay for two or three Years, with Portions of Land, at an easy Quit-rent; thus the <HI>French</HI> Set|tlers, our perfidiousSubjects may be elbowed out. 3. The inconceiv|able Decay of our Trade and Business: Fishery and Ship building are the most considerable Articles: Formerly from <HI>Marblehead</HI> our principal Cod-Fishery-Port, there were about 160 Fishing Scooners, at present 1748 only about 60 Scooners: Formerly there have been upon the Stocks in <HI>Boston</HI> 7000 Ton of Top-sail Vessels, at present not much exceeding 2000 Tons. 4. Some of our Townships, and consequently their Proportion of Taxes, have lately by the Determi|nation of the King in Council, been set off to the neighbouring Go|vernments of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> 5. The late sudden and considerably enhanced Pay of the three Negatives of the Legisla|ture, notwithstanding Exchange, Silver, and Necessaries of Life (Cloathing growing cheaper) being nearly at the same Price <HI>Anno</HI> 1747 and 1748.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our Combination of Debtors who formerly were for postponing of Paper Money, all of a sudden inconsistently with their proper Cha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acter, <HI>quicquid id est tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> are for sinking all Paper-Currency in the Space of a Year or two; we may without Breach of Charity suspect their hurrying the Province into a State of Confusion, that they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in troubled Waters; perhaps as Paper-Currency arrived by De|grees, to a vast Sum, and great Depreciation; it would be more na|tural to sink it gradually in the Space of half a Dozen, or half a Score of Years; and by Act of Parliament (not by precarious Instructions) no more Paper-Money to be emitted, a Governor consenting to any such Emissions to be rendred incapable and mulcted. Notwithstand|ing that I always was a professed Enemy to all Paper, as being a base fallacious, and fraudulent Contrivance of a Currency, I cannot avoid thinking that this is the most salutary Method.</P>
<P N="4">4. The honest and honourable Way of paying a Bill, is, accord|ing to the Face of the Bill, that is, all Bills with us of 6 <HI>s.</HI> in the Face of the Bills, should be paid in a Piece of Eight; whereas by the Act 1748, a Piece of Eight shall be received in Payments for 11 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> New Tenor; thus these Bills in their own pernicious Nature, from <HI>Anno</HI> 1742 to 1748 have suffered a Discount of about 10 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound: Mr. <HI>S&mdash;l&mdash;y</HI> in a Speech or Message in Relation to the first Emission of these New Tenor Bills insinuates, that he had con|trived Bills which could not depreciate: But notwithstanding, these Bills have greatly depreciated in passing through several Hands, and as it is impossible to adjust the Proportion of Depreciation in each of these Heads, it is <HI>unreasonable</HI> that the <HI>last Possessor</HI> should have the Allowance of the successive Depreciations: Therefore the Assembly in Equity have allowed the Possessor only the current Value, but here the Assembly seem to allow themselves to be Bankrupts at the Rate of 10 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound, from 1742 to 1748. Perhaps if a Piece of Eight had been in the new Projection enacted equal to 12 <HI>s.</HI> New Tenor, which is 48 <HI>s.</HI> Old Tenor, the general Price amongst Mer|chants; it would have been no Injustice to the Possessors, it would have prevented their being hoarded up, and the Reimburse|ment Money would have paid off about 6 <HI>per Cent</HI> more of our Debts, that is, cancelled so much more of our <HI>iniquitous Currency.</HI> N. B. Perhaps, the stating of a Piece of Eight (seven Eights of an Ounce of Silver) at 6 <HI>s.</HI> Currency, and one Ounce of Silver at 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> is out of Proportion: the true Proportion is 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> two 7ths.</P>
<P N="5">5. In Place of sending over the Reimbursement in foreign Silver-Coin, if the Provincial Treasurer were empowered from Home and here, to draw partial Bills for the same upon the <HI>British</HI> Treasury, or where else it may be lodged; this would save Commissions, Insurance, Freight, and small Charges, to the Value of about 12,000 &pound;. Sterl. upon the 183,000 &pound;. Reimbursement, sufficient to discharge 120,000&pound;. Old Tenor, of our Debts. I shall not say that private pecuniary Views, but not Oeconomy are in the Case.</P>
<P>Upon the Supposition of this Reimbursement Money being remitted by Bills of Exchange, consulting the best Advantage of the Pro|vince; perhaps by appropriating one half of the Reimbursement for that End, 910,000 &pound;. O. T. of our Debt or Bills would in the most ex|peditious Manner be instantly sunk; all Merchants, Shop-keepers, and others would gladly purchase with our Paper such good and punctual Bills preferable to any other private Bills of Exchange: The other half of the Reimbursement to be by the like Bills of Exchange pur|chased here by Silver to introduce a Silver Currency, the <HI>only proper commercial Medium</HI>; providentially in Favour of this Purpose, we have lately had imported a Capture from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of 54 Chests of Silver, which the Owners would gladly have exchanged for such Bills; all Merchants and others in <HI>New-England</HI> and the adjacent Pro|vinces who send Pieces of Eight Home as Returns, or to purchase fresh Goods, would be fond of bringing their Silver to purchase such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood Bills free from all the Charges of other Remittances: Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Silver Currency commencing, of 910,000 &pound;. Old Tenor Value, we shall have a remaining Paper-Currency of 1,495,000 to be can|celled gradually by Rites and other Taxes, suppose in 10 Years, is about 150,000 &pound;. Old Tenor, or 37,500 &pound;. New Tenor <HI>per Annum</HI>; thus the two Years 1748 and 1749, perhaps oppressively loaded, will be much eased, and the infatuated Paper-Currency Men made easy by sinking of it gradually; with the Proviso of an Act of Parliament prohibiting, <HI>for ever</HI> hereafter, any more publick Bills of Credit to be emitted.</P>
<P>This remaining 1,495,000 &pound;. Paper Currency, abstracting from the 910,000 &pound;. Silver, Part of the Reimbursement, is more than a sufficient Medium for Trade and Business, in a quick Circulation, in the Province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI> Let us recollect, that in the latter Part of Governor <HI>Belcher</HI>'s Administration 1741, immediately preceed|ing Governor <HI>Shirley</HI>'s Accession, this Province in its full Vigour and Extent of Trade, seemed to be sufficiently supplied, by a Sum not exceeding 160,000 &pound;. a Fund for Taxes not assessed, for Taxes as|sessed but not collected, and for Arrears of Loans; let us suppose a like Sum of 160,000 &pound;. from the neighbouring Governments, ob|tained a Credit of Circulation with us (the four Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> hitherto as to Currencies have been as one Province) makes 320,000 &pound;.; at that Time Silver was at 29 <HI>s.</HI> per Ounce, at this Time 1748 it is 58 <HI>s.</HI> per Ounce; therefore upon this Foundation we must suppose 640,000 &pound;. Old Tenor Value, the Medium sufficient or requisite for our Trade and Business, whereas we have allowed 1,495,000 &pound;. Old Tenor Value, being more than double that Sum, to remain for a Paper Currency.</P>
<P>A Stranger may think it unaccountable that in the Beginning of Governor <HI>Shirley</HI>'s Administration, <HI>Anno</HI> 1741, the projected speedy cancelling of about 130,000 Old Tenor Bills by the Taxes for 1741 should be judged too oppressive for one Year, and was therefore di|vided amongst three subsequent Years; whereas the 103,000 &pound;. New Tenor, or 412,000 Old Tenor, Taxes of 1748 (although, we have the Reimbursement Money, to alleviate this grievous Weight) to|wards the End of his Administration, is not lightned.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>If in granting of these Lands, they had been subjected to an easy Quit-rent to the Province; these Lands would have settled compactly, and improved sooner; whereas at present, some Proprietors of large Tracts of Lands do not settle or sell, because being at no Charge of Quit-Rent, and not in the Valuation of <HI>Rates</HI> or <HI>Taxes</HI> for the Provincial Charge of Government; they chuse to let them lie unimproved many Years, for a Market.

<P>The Townships that have Precepts sent to them, but make no Returns, are liable to be fined at the Discretion of the House; but are generally excused, and perhaps out of 50 Delinquents (some are excused by Law, as be|ing under the Number of eighty Families) very few are fined; this Article though very small, is one of the Articles for calling in the publick Bills of Credit from Year to Year.</P>
<P>Perhaps an Assembly Grant, as is the present Practice, in the Beginning of every Year's Administration of a Governor for his Services to be done during the next sub|sequent Year, may be thus qualified; to be paid after 12 Months, if the present Governor's Life or Administration continue so long, otherwise in Proportion to the Time of Service: We have a remarkable Instance of this in the worthy Governor <HI>Burnet</HI>; some short Time before his Death, there was a Vote of 6000 &pound;. for the last Year and current Year's Service, which for Want of Concur|rence did not take Place; soon after the Commencement

<P>In Gratitude, we ought not to forget the compassion|ate Goodness of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Parent of all our Colonies. The Expences of the Pro|vince of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> in taking, repairing and

New Tenor Paper <HI>New-England</HI> Currency, which according to the Exchange of that Time, amounted to 183,649 &pound;. Sterl.; but when the Accounts were sent Home, our Currency was so much depreciated, that the 261,700 &pound;. New Tenor, was in Value equal only to 104,680 &pound;. Sterl.; making a dif|ference of 78,969 &pound;. Sterl. This produced a Question at Court and in Parliament; whether the said Province, ought to be paid a Sterling Sum, equal in Value, to the Sum in Bills of Credit, expended upon the Expedition, according to the Value of these Bills at the Time the Ex|pence was contracted, or only a Sterling Sum, equal to the Value of these Bills in their present depreciated State? In Goodness they determined according to the favourable Side of the Question, and allowed us the full Sum of 183,649 &pound;. Sterl.</P>

<P>The Encouragement for Privateers commissioned by the Governor, was 10 &pound;.

<P>The Alacrity of the <HI>New-England</HI> Militia may be ob|served, by the Alarm from <HI>d' Anville</HI>'s <HI>Brest French</HI> Squadron, End of September 1746; in a very short time 6400 Men from the Country well armed, appeared in <HI>Boston</HI> Common, some of them (<HI>v. g.</HI> from <HI>Brookfield</HI>) tra|velled 70 Miles in two Days, each with a Pack (in which was Provision for 14 Days) of about a Bushel Corn Weight: <HI>Connecticut</HI> was to have sent us 6000 Men, being one half of their training List; these Men were paid by the Province for their Travel and Attendance.</P>
