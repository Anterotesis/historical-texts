<P>HAd I opportunity but to borrow some of the Authors wit, 'tis possible I might so trim this curious work with such quaint expressions, as that the Preface might bespeak thy further Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">usal; but I fear 'twill be a shame for a Man that can speak so little, To be seen in the title page of this Womans Book|lest by comparing the one with the other, the Rea|der should pass his sentence that it is the gift of wo|men not only to speak most but to speak best; I shal leave therefore to commend that, which with any ingenious Reader will too much commend the Au|thor, unless men turn more peevish then women, to envy the excellency of the inferiour Sex. I doubt not but the Reader will quickly find more then I can say, and the worst effect of his reading will be unbelief, which will make him question whether it be a womans work, and askc, Is is possible? If any do, take this as an answer from him that dares avow it; It is the Work of a Woman, honoured, and esteemed where she lives, for her gracious de|meanour, her eminent parts, her pious conversa|tion, her courteous disposition, her exact diligence in her place, and discreet managing of her Family
