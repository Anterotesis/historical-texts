<P>THe Apostacy of our first Parents has plunged all their miserable Off-spring into a gulph of Wo; and brought upon them a dreadful Weight of Distress and Misery. By this are we universally polluted and defiled, all the Members of our Bodies, and all the Facul|ties of our Souls are Wounds and Bruises&punc; and putrifying Sores, that we are loathsome and abo|minable in the Sight of that God with whom we have to do: By this, we are brought under the Power and Dominion of our Lusts, Sin reigns in our mortal Bodies; and we obey it in the Lusts thereof: and what an astonishing Prospect have we of the terrible Effects of a Life of Sin and Guilt. By this we are brought under the Empire of Satan, and <HI>led Captive by him at his Pleasure</HI>; and how awful is the Thought of being for ever the Slaves and Companions of the Devil.

<P>Whatever Hope any may entertain of Salva|tion, while continuing in an Estate of carnal Security, their Hopes will be cut off; and their Expectations perish.

<P>Conviction of Sin is the first Operation of the Spirit of God, in Order to a Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving Con|version to him. Accordingly our blessed Lord promises to <HI>send the Comforter, to convince the World of Sin,</HI> Joh. xvi.8. and this is exemplified to us, in all the Conversions we have a particular Account of in the New Testament. Thus St. <HI>Peters</HI> Hearers, from an awakening Sense of their Danger, <HI>are prick'd in their Heart, and cry'd out to the Apostles, Men and Brethren, what shall we do</HI>? Acts. ii.37.

Convictions are sometimes begun in the Soul by the Means of some awakening Providence, some|times by Christian Conferences&punc; sometimes by publick, and sometimes by private Ordinances; and even sometimes by the immediate Influences of the Spirit of God, without any known Means or outward Occasion whatsoever: But the Means which God, is most usually pleased to bless unto this End, is the Ministry of the Gospel. <HI>It has pleased God, by the Foolishness of Preaching to save those that believe,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.21.</P>
<P>These Convictions of which I speak, are or|dinarily begun in the Soul, from a view of some more gross Pollutions and more aggravated Im|pieties and Enormities, that the guilty Sinner sees himself chargeable with. These stare him in the Face, lay iust hold on his Conscience; and set before him, a fearful Prospect of that fiery Indignation, that is like to consume him. These lye down and rise with him, and follow him wherever he goes, and whatever he does, till his Soul is filled with Terror and Amazement. But then, if these Conviction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have any good Ef|fect upon the Soul, they won't stop here, until the Sinner is brought to see, that <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umerable Evils have compassed him about,</HI> that <HI>his Iniquities have taken hold upon him, that he cannot look up</HI>; that <HI>they are more than the Hairs of his Head; and therefore, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Heart faileth him</HI>&punc; according to that in in <HI>Psal.</HI> xl.12.

a saving Effect, Some are more suddenly sur|prized with a Sight of their undone Estate&punc; others more gradually brought to a Sense of it. Some are more sorely broken with distressing and distracting Terrors from an afrighting View of the Weight of their Guilt, of the Wrath of an incensed God; and of the dreadful Damnation they have in Prospect; others in their greatest Distresses, have stronger Hopes to Support them from Sinking under such unut|terable Anguish. Some for a long Time a|gonize under these Horrors of Conscience; and are for Years together kept under a Spirit of Bondage; others are quickly brought to the Foot-Stool of God's Mercy, to Rest with Com|fort in an absolute Dependance upon Christ alone for Justification and Life. But how dif|ferent soever these Convictions may be, none will ever be brought to Christ, till they are convinced that they are undone, helpless, and hopeless in themselves, and until they are brought to an utter Despair of Salvation, from any Thing they do or can do for their own Relief.</P>

This Effect they had upon the Psalmist: <HI>There is</HI> (says he) <HI>no Soundness in my Flesh, because of thine Anger; neither is there any Rest in my Bones, because of my Sin.

This Effect must Convictions have upon all of us, in Order to our being prepared by them to come to Christ for <HI>Rest.</HI> Those of us that could before commit Sin with Greediness, and roll the sweet Morsel under our Tongues, must now be brought to tremble at the Apprehension of Sinning against God. Those of us that could before quietly live in the Neglect of known Duty; and slothfully turn our Backs upon the Publick or private Ordinances of God, shall not now dare to neglect any Occasion of Divine Worship; but shall be Constant at Publick Ordinances, at Family Worship, and Closet Duties, Constant in our reading the Word of God, and other good Books; in Meditatin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon, and conversing about the Great Things of our Eternal Peace.

<P>This Experience we must every one of us attain to, or we are undone for ever. We must be thus humbled, and brought off from all Confidence in ourselves, and from all attainments of our own that we either have, or hope for, before we can have any Interest in the Gra|cious Promise before us. To this I will add once more.</P>
<P N="4">4ly, They who are <HI>Weary and Heavy Laden,</HI> are brought to a lively Sense of their utter Un|worthiness that God should shew them any Mercy. What I have said already gives us some View of the great Distress of an awakened humbled Sinner; they have found all their Refuges fail, all their Cisterns drawn dry; and all their Props knock'd from under them. <HI>And whither shall they flee for help?</HI> Could they with the careless World, flatter themselves from the Riches of God's Mercy and the Merits of Christ, without an Interest in either of them, that would ease them of their Burthen; and lull 'em asleep in Security. But alas! they are pressed down with a Weight of Guilt, which challenges the Justice of a provoked God. They see that they deserve nothing but Wrath, that they have no Claim to Mercy; and that they can do nothing which will enti|tle 'em to it. They see that God may justly take the Forfeiture at their Hands, and glorify

himself in their Eternal Ruin; and thence are ready to Wonder at the Patience and Long-Suffering of God towards such henious, hard hearted Sinners as they are.</P>
<P>There is indeed a great Difference in the humbling Views of their own Unworthiness, which these <HI>Weary and Heavy Laden</HI> Sinners en|tertain. Some of them have such a Sense of their Guilt and just exposedness to the Divine Wrath, that they <HI>are Troubled, they are bow's down greatly, and go Mourning all the Day long.</HI> They see that God may justly reject them; and they don't know but he will, and how dreadful does their Case appear, while they see but a meer Possibility of escaping his eter|nal Vengeance! Some of them find such Pow|erful Corruptions, such deadness in Duty; and such hardness of Heart, that they are ready to fear that they are given up of God, that they have Sinned away their Day of Grace, and that the Things of their Peace are hidden from their Eyes. These from such a distres|sing Prospect of their State, and from the Powerful Temptations of Satan setting in with it, are some Times ready to give up the Case, and to conclude that <HI>God's Mercies are clean gone forever; and that he hath in Anger shut up his tender Mercies.</HI> Others will be more comforta|bly Supported in their greatest Darkness and Fears, with some Hopes of undeserved Mercy, they will still hope (how dark soever their Case appears) that the Rich and free Grace of God, which has been so often Glo|rified

in the Salvation of the greatest Sinners, may extend even to them also, and that ever they may be made Partakers of the Redempti|on of Christ, which has been so dearly pur|chased, and is so freely offered. And how glo|ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us and astonishing will this free Grace and Love of God in Christ appear to them, when they can entertain, any satifying Prospect of it.</P>
<P>I can't pretend at Present to set before you all the various Operations of the Spirit of Grace in a humbled heavy laden Soul. But this is their united Character; and what is always found in every one that is prepared to come to Christ for Rest, that they absolutely despair of all their own Strength or Ability to help them|seves, that they altogether give up all Hope, from any Thing else but the free, forfeited&punc; and undeserved Grace, and Mercy of God&punc; and the infinite Merit, and inexhaustible Fulness and Sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly, tho' but imperfectly de|scribed to you the <HI>Weary and Heavy Laden Soul.</HI> I have shewn you what Convictions of Sin, what a Burthen under the Weight of it, what solicitous enquiries after the Way of Salvation, and what a deep Impression of our own Im|potency and Unworthiness of Mercy, are ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essary Preparations for our coming to Christ.

<P>If any of you are prejudiced against these Doctrines, and think I have carried the Point too far; the Power of Divine Grace, if you are so happy as to obtain it, will remove your Prejudices, and give you an experimental Con|viction of their Truths.</P>
<P>If any of you are surprized at what you have heard, as being Strangers to all these Things; the Lord set home the Surprize to Purpose, till you have attain'd to the happy Experience, that you mayn't perish for ever with Unconverted Sinners.</P>

in the Text. <HI>Come unto Christ and he will give you Rest.</HI> And for your Assistance in so do|ing I shall Endeavour to point out the Way by shewing you.</P>
<P N="1">I&middot; What is imply'd in coming to Christ, that we may have Rest.</P>
<P>Upon this I shall observe in general, that <HI>coming to Christ</HI> implies the same Thing, with believing on him. Thus it is explained <HI>Ioh.</HI> vi.35. <HI>He that cometh to me shall never Hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never Thirst.</HI> To come to Christ is therefore to give such a hearty Assent to the Truths of the Gospel, as to be fully confirm'd in them, and to have them Powerfully impressed on our Minds. It is readily to consent with our whole Hearts to the Proposals of the Gospel, and to Receive the Lord Jesus Christ upon his own Terms. It is to Place all our Confidence upon him as <HI>the Lord our Righteousness,</HI> and as the Fountain of Grace and Life, that he may be all in all to us. Or in other Words, it is to choose him for our Portion, to give up ourselves wholly to him, and to trust in him alone <HI>as the Author of our E|ternal Salvation.</HI> This is to come to Christ; and this the only Terms by which we can be en|titled to the Rest here promised.</P>
<P>Sinners are ready to flatter themselves with safety, and to quiet their Consciences in a State of Sin and Impenitence, from such Gracious Encouragement as this in our Text. It is but c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ming to Christ, and they shall obtain Salvati|o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> As though this were in their own Power;

and as though they could by this Means at their Pleasure obtain a Deliverance from Sin and Guilt, and a Title to Heaven. But what do they understand by coming to Christ? No more perhaps, than Praying to him, and at|tending some of the Ordinances of the Gos|pel, as if this were sufficient to make up the Breach between God and their Souls. But I beseech you, my Brethren, to receive this for an established truth, that you are never to hope for an Interest in Christ and his Salvation, until you are brought to receive a whole Christ with your whole Hearts, and to be united to him by a vital Faith. There is no <HI>Rest</HI> to be obtain'd from Christ, until you place all your Rest in him; and have all your Dependance upon him. <HI>Without Faith its impossible to please God,</HI> Heb. xi&punc;6 <HI>He that believes not shall be damned,</HI> Mark xvi.16, Some of you may perhaps, be startled at this Doctrine, as what robs you of all the Comfort you had taken from the Text. For if this be coming to Christ, you are no more able to come to him by your own Power, than to create a New World. <HI>Faith is the Gift of God, and what Flesh and Blood cannot reveal,</HI> you are therefore plunged into Distress; and what can you do?</P>
<P>That I may obviate this Difficulty, I would further observe to you, that if you would come to Christ, you must repair to him, and rely upon him for Grace to receive him. He is the <HI>Au|thoo and Finisher of our Faith,</HI> Heb. xii.2. <HI>It is of his Fulness that we all receive, and even Grace for Grace,</HI> Joh. i.16. We cannot indeed come
<PB N="21" REF="004502_0020_0F5E2E6DAB683A78">
to Christ and believe in him, without the Supernatural Assistances of Divine Grace. But cannot we endeavour to lye at his Foot-stool, in Order to obtain those Gracious Influences, whereby we may <HI>receive him, and have Power to become the Children of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>? We cannot, it's true; ever do this, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve us a Claim to those Divine Assistances, as being any Way due to the best of our defective Performances or Endeavours; yet we can Endeavour to do it as well as we can. It is more than possible for such humbled Souls as have been described, to Endeavour to cast themselves at the Foot-stool of the Lord Jesus Christ; to have the Work of Faith with Power, wrought in theiro Suls And in that Way they have all possible En|couragement, that if they thus seek they shall find.</P>
<P>We must therefore Endeavour a most serious and solemn Attendance upon all the Ordinan|ces of Divine Wors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and especially to <HI>Pray with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit</HI>; and in that Way, seek for the Blessing promised to those th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Watch at his Gate; and wait at the Posts of his Doors.</HI></P>
<P>We must be Constant and diligent in our Attendance upon all the Means of Grace; and <HI>be not slothful in Business; but fervent in Spirit, ser|ving the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>We must be importunate in our Suits for Mercy, and with <HI>Iacob</HI> wrestle with him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> saving Influences of his Spirit and Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">esolving not to let him go until he bless us.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004502_0021_0F5E2E6E5A283A60">We must persevere in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Course of most active Diligence, whether we see any present Returns or not. If we are forced to walk in the Dark, we must yet <HI>follow on to seek the Lord,</HI> and resolve <HI>if he slay us, we will yet trust in him.</HI> If the comfortable Effects of our Endeavours seem to <HI>tarry, we must wait for them, for they will come and will not tarry.</HI></P>
<P>We must after all, prostrate both our Per|sons and Services at his Foot, deeply sensible that he may justly reject them both, <HI>making men|tion of his Righteousness and that only</HI>; and plead|ing only the Riches of his free, unmerited, Sovereign Grace and Love.</P>
<P>Thus I have set before you the only Terms, upon which you may hope for Rest from Christ. Those of you whose Consciences tell you, that you are yet Strangers to these Qualifications, have Cause to be awaken'd from a Sense of your Miserable undone Condition, and of the Ne|cessity of your flying for your Lives to this Ci|ty of Refuge, before the Avenger of Blood overtake you. Those of you that have good Hopes through Grace, that you have thus come to Christ, are now to have the Comforts of Rest proposed to you. In Order to this I shall consider.</P>
<P N="3">III. What that <HI>Rest</HI> is, which the Lord Je|sus Christ will bestow upon those <HI>Weary and Heavy Laden</HI> Souls, that come to him for it.</P>

<P>Here is <HI>Rest</HI> and Deliverance promised from the Guilt and damning Power of Sin. Though every Christless Sinner be <HI>condemned already and the Wrath of God abides on him,</HI> Joh. iii, 36. Yet if he will come to Christ, the Sentence of Death, will be reversed; the Curse of the Law taken off, and the Guilty Soul reconciled to God through the Death of the Cross. <HI>There is no Con|demnation to them which are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the Flesh; but after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. viii.1.</P>
<P>Here is <HI>Rest</HI> also promised from the Dominion of Sin.

<P>Here is <HI>Rest</HI> and Freedom likewise promised from the Tyranny of Satan. tho' Satan has an absolu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Dominion over, and a full Propriety in unsanct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fied Sinners, that they are guided by his Directions, acted by his Influences; and hurried headlong by his Temptations in the Paths of Destruction and Death; and though they are all <HI>of their Father the Devil, and the Lusts of their Father they will do</HI>; yet if they will <HI>come to Christ,</HI> he will strengthen them against Satans Temptations; and <HI>with the Temptation make a Way for their Escape,</HI> he will Support them under his fiercest Assaults, and enable them to <HI>stand against the Wiles of the Devil, and to quench all his Fiery Darts</HI>; he will bruise <HI>Satan under their Feet shortly,</HI> Rom. xvi.20.</P>
<P>Here is moreover <HI>Rest</HI> promised from the Damnation of Hell&punc; Though every Uncon|verted Sinner is under a Sentence of Eternal Damnation; and there is but a Step between them and the <HI>Lake of Fire and Brimstone, which is the second Death</HI>; yet if they will <HI>come to Christ</HI> he will disarm Hell of all its Terrors, free them from the dreadful Danger, and prepare them for an Eternal Triumph over it, while others are weltering in the Flaming Vengeance, and <HI>Weeping and Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling and Gnashing of their Teeth for ever.</HI> For <HI>he that believeth on him, shall not come into Condemnation</HI>&punc; Joh. v.24.</P>

that come to Christ. These shall be <HI>kept by the Power of God, through Faith to Salvation.</HI> They shall <HI>be guided by his Counsel; and afterward brought to Glory.</HI> They shall in the Conclusion be E|ternally free from all their Fears, Darkness, Temptations and Tribulations; and be pos|sessed of the Joy of their Lord, where they shall enjoy <HI>what Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard; neither has entred into the Heart of Man</HI>; where they shall Eternally tune their Harps to the Praise of him, who has loved them, and wash|ed them from their Sins in his own Blood, and made them Kings and Priests, to God and his Father. This is the <HI>Rest which remains for the People of God,</HI> Heb. .iv.9.</P>
<P>Thus I have set before you a <HI>Rest,</HI> worthy of your Choice and Pursuit. How intollerably Miserable must all those be, that come short of it. How inconceivably happy will they be, that enter into this <HI>Rest.</HI> And why then will any of you be so mad, as to forego this blessed Prospect for the Gratification of your base and sordid Lusts and Pleasures?

It is indeed a Wonder that any such as these, who reject the Lord that bought them; and set light by the infinite Merits of his Blood, should ever obtain Mercy. But such are the boundless R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ches of his Grace and Love, that some of those Guilty Wretches, who <HI>with Wicked Hands had Crucified and slain</HI> the Lord of Life, had the Promise of Salvation made unto them and to their Children, Acts. ii 23, 39. And the same Promise is made unto
<PB N="31" REF="004502_0030_0F5E2E76CD16A5A0">
you also, if you will attend the Directions given to them. He that saved <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul, a Blasphemer, a Persecutor and Injuriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for this Cause bestow'd Mer|cy upon him, that in him first Iesus Christ might shew forth all Long-Suffering, for a Pattern to them which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould hereafter believe on him, to Life everlasting.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13.16.

<P>I may add to all this, Though you find Cause to complain of great hardness of Heart; Stupidity, and Insensibility; yet you are invi|ted to <HI>come to Christ</HI> for Relief in this Case also. You may perhaps imagine your selves exempted from all the Gracious Encouragements that have been set before you, since you are altoge|ther uncapable to comply with the Terms where|on they are proposed. Could you but <HI>come to Christ,</HI> you are sensible there would be Hope. But alas! you are a Poor hard hearted graceless Sinner; and what Hope can there be for you? Your Affections are dead and dull, that you can have no lively Impression of the Things that are unseen and Eternal. Your Duties are formal and superficial; and your Hearts crouded with sinful and wandring Thoughts in your nearest Approaches to God; which you are ready to fear renders your Case remediless. These and such like Complaints are commonly made by convinced and humbled Sinners; and are the

common Occasion of their greatest Darkness and Distress. But were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Complaints just, and their Heart as hard and graceless as they suppose, their desperate Conclusions would no waies follow from thence. The infinite Mercy of the great Redeemer does as well ex|tend to such <HI>Weary and Heavy Laden</HI> Sinners, as to others. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch as you (if any such there be amongst my Hearers) who are burthen'd with a Sense of the hardness of your Hearts; and are groaning after Deliverance from it, have all the Encouragement you can desire, to depend upon Gods gracious Promise, that he <HI>will take away the Heart of Stone out of your Flesh; and give you a Heart of Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh,</HI> Ezek. xxxvi.26.

<P>And now, what can stand in the Way of your Salvation, but your own Obstinacy and Stupidity? What can hinder your obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ining an Interest in Christ and all the Benefits of his Redemption, but your care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess neglect and Rejection of him? Though the Case of se|cure Sinners be indeed as dreadful as can be imagined; yet the Comforts given by our Lord Jesus Christ to Poor awaken'd and distressed Souls, are as great as they themselves could de|sire, were they to state their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Terms of ac|ceptance with God. All the Danger in this Case, is a Misapplication of these Preci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us Con|solations.
