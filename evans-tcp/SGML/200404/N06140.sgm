<HEAD>THE
LIFE of Iohn,&mdash;
Alias
Owen Syllavan, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IWAS bred and born in the County of <HI>Wax|ford</HI>
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of English Parents near the
Town of <HI>Fedard,</HI> and from my youth I was
always in all kind of Mischief; so that I never
minded Father nor Mother, Sister nor Brother;
but went on in all Manner of Vice, till I came to
the Age of eleven Years, or there-abouts; I was
confined by my Parents in a Room, and fed up|on
Bread and Water for a considerable Time, and
then I seemed to humble myself; till I again ob|tained
my Liberty, and after that I was ten Times,
worse than I was before; so that my Parents was
obliged to send me to another Place, some Distance
from home to a School-Master, who my Parents
gave strict charge to keep me from Vice, and keep
to my Learning.</P>
<P>And the first Night that I lodged there, I was
called by an evil Spirit by my Christian Name;
<HI>Iohn, Iohn, Iohn, Iohn,</HI> and that for several
Minutes together, to the Surpise of myself, and all
<PB N="4" REF="007796_0004_0F6A0BF59986BAA0">
the Family: and so continued for three or four
Nights together, before there was any Notice taken
of it; but the fourth Night my Master set up, and
Read by me till Eleven o'Clock; and then the
Spirit began to call again, <HI>Iohn, Iohn, Iohn,</HI> and
that every Minute, for sixty Times together by
my Master's Watch; and that lasted so for three
Months together. The Ministers from sundry
Parishes came to set with me; as also sundry Per|sons,
who always pray'd by me, and giving me
all good Advice in their Power, begging and
praying of me, to Repent. Then I began to fear
GOD; and finding so many Hundreds of People
that came to see me from far and near, who took
pitty upon me. At last some of them concluded
to take me to one of their Houses, which they
did; as soon as it was eleven o'Clock, the Spirit
began to call again, <HI>why Iohn! why Iohn! why
Iohn!</HI> it called so loud that the Windows shook,
and every one in the House trembled for Fear, ex|cept
myself. I was taken Sick about five or six
Days, before the Spirit had done calling, and dur|ing
my Sickness it called louder then before; and
as I laid in Bed, there was something that seem'd to
press me between my Shoulders with a Hand, but
saw nothing.</P>
<P>So this continued till I was Removed to my
Parents, who then took Campassion upon me; and
to the best of my Knowledge I lay Sick, for about
the same Time as the Spirit had called to me be|fore,
but not troubled with any more of that evil
Spirit. So it pleased GOD to restore me to my
former Health, and I went to School again; but
fell from Good to Evil, by provoking my Parents
<PB N="5" REF="007796_0005_0F6A0BF629D5FDD0">
and giving ill Advice to others, such as my Play|mates,
&amp;c. And when my Parents chastised me for
my Faults, I look'd upon it as Tyranny, and told
them several Times to exercise their Tyranny upon
me. And when I was about thirteen Years of Age
I deserted from my Parents, and stroll'd away to a
Place called <HI>Bellaback,</HI> near the Passage of <HI>Water|ford,</HI>
so coming down to the Water Side, there
was a small Boat ready to push off, and I desired
of them to take me aboard, which they refused and
told me they was not going over the Ferry;
but told me they was going to <HI>Waterford,</HI> I asked
of them to give me a Passage there, for I wanted
to see my Aunt; so they asked my Name, and I
told my Name was <HI>Owen Syllevan</HI> which was a
Lye, for it was there I changed my Name, and so
they gave me my Passage to <HI>Waterford,</HI> and I
strol'd from Place to Place, till I came to the
County of <HI>Limerick.</HI> There was a Gentleman
Riding along, asked me whose Son I was, I made
answer I was born in <HI>Dublin</HI> and of poor Parentage,
and that they were Dead, and I told him I was go|ing
to <HI>Cork,</HI> expecting to find some Relations, and
told him my Name was <HI>Owen Syllavan.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentleman told me if I would go and live
with him, he would be my Friend and Relation too,
with that I consented and went with him to his
Country-Seat, his Lady looking out of the Win|dow,
he with a smiling Countenance said, I have
brought you a pretty Boy to wait upon you, the
Lady seemed to like me very well, and I gave them
an Indsnture to serve for seven Years, and so be|come
my Lady's running Foot-Page. And was
<PB N="6" REF="007796_0006_0F6A0BF899C0F4E0">
train'd up to running, and served them almost six
Years, which pleased me better than Schooling;
and in the sixth Year of my Servitude, I seemed to
be home sick; and set a Resolution if I should be
sent of an Errand that way, I would make the
best of my Way Home, which was about one 100
Miles: And soon after my Master wanted me to
carry a Letter to a Gentleman, about twenty Miles
distance. I embrac'd that Opportunity, delivered
my Letter, but did not wait for any Answer; but
went direct for <HI>Waterford,</HI> where I arrived the
same Day, about four o'Clock in the Afternoon,
which was seventy Miles. When I came to <HI>Water|ford,</HI>
I drank a Tumbler full of Wine, and being
very Hot, I was taken with a Pluratick Pain, and
lay Sick there for some Time; although I was then
about thirty Miles from my Father's House, I
would not let myself be known; but told the
People, that my Errand was as far as <HI>Waxford</HI>
Town. After I got well I went down to the
Wharf, where I saw several Passengers going on
Board of a Vessel bound for <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-Eng|land;</HI>
so I goes up to the Captain, and agrees
with him for my Passage; and Bound my self for
four Years, and in a few Days set Sail for <HI>Boston;</HI>
where we arrived in about nine Weeks: but hav|ing
many Souls on Board, we was very scant of
Provision. I agreed with the Captain to serve
him three Years more, for as many Biscuit as I
could Eat, during the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="faint"> of three Glasses,
which caused the Captain to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> into a Laughter,
and so consented to it: but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="faint"> have no Water
during the Time. After our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="faint"> at <HI>Boston,</HI> I
told the Captain I had as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="faint"> for seven
<PB N="7" REF="007796_0007_0F6A0BF94CA54630">
Years, as for a Day; since I must be Sold, and
to get for me as much as he could. And he Sold
me to one Captain <HI>Gillmore,</HI> living about twenty|four
Hours Sail to the Eastward of <HI>Boston,</HI> to a
Place called St. <HI>George</HI>'s-<HI>River.</HI> I served that
Gentleman two Years and an half, in chopping of
Wood and clearing of Land; and hearing of a
<HI>French</HI> War, my Master and all the Family Re|moved
to <HI>Boston,</HI> except my self; my Master Sold
the Remainder of my Time to Captain <HI>Bradbery,</HI>
who I served two Years, as a Soldier, and proved
faithful to my King and Country.</P>
<P>And after that, contrary to my Master's Will,
I listed under Captain <HI>Waldo,</HI> in General <HI>Shirley</HI>'s
Regiment of Foot, for <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and after that&punc;
I was Drafted into Captain <HI>Gordon</HI>'s Company of
Grenadiers, and took great Delight in the Disci|pline,
which pleased my Officers exceedingly, and
they was pleased to put me chief Armourer of the
Regiment; and some Time after, they thought
proper that I should Number and Engrave the
Arms of the Regiment belonging to Governor
<HI>Shirley,</HI> as also Sir <HI>William Pepperrell</HI>'s Regiment's
Arms, and so continued as Armourer for two
Years; then I unhappily Married a Wife, which
proved a Torment to me, and made my Life un|comfortable;
and she was given to take a Cup
too much, and I for my Part took to the same;
and through her aggravating Tongue, neglecting
my Business, I was turned out, and was obliged to
do private duty again as a common Soldier. And
after I was off Duty, I took and set myself up as
a Silversmith, and followed Engraving and Seal-Cutting;
<PB N="8" REF="007796_0008_0F6A0BF9E98C8D08">
and as I was Moulding, I cast a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Dollar amongst the rest of my Work and laid it
down on the Work-Bench, so that I did not care
who saw it; and by an ill-minded Man who made
it his Business to inform against me, I was taken
up for the same and Try'd by a General Court-Marshal;
I pleaded Guilty, and by the Dollar's be|ing
good Silver was acquitted, and some Time
after, I quarrel'd with a brother Soldier, and he
complain'd to his Officer about it, and for that
Crime I receiv'd Fifty Stripes; and in a short Time
after the Regiment was broke, I came to <HI>Boston,</HI>
and sat up to Engraving; and in that Time there
came two Men who perswaded me to Engrave
them a Plate for <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Money, which I
did, and they Rewarded me well for it. I thought
it was an easy Way of getting Money, so I Coun|terfeited
the <HI>Boston</HI> Bills of Credit; but never made
none above <HI>Forty Shillings.</HI> Soon after, my Wife
and I having diftered together, she cry'd out Hey,
you Forty Thousand Money-Maker, which was
heard by some of the Neighbours, who made a
complaint against me; for which I was Apprehen|ded,
and stood Tryal, and was acquitted, by Rea|son
they had no Law for that Money: The Attor|ney-General
desired that I should be continued in
Custody till next Court, or give Bail for my Ap|pearance;
the next Sessions they found a Bill against
me for Forgery, and was found Guilty, for which
I stood two Hours in the Pillory and received
Twenty Lashes at the public Whipping-Post;
during my Confinement, I engraved three sorts of
Plates, two of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Money, and one
for <HI>Boston</HI> Currency, and for want of a Rolling
<PB N="9" REF="007796_0009_0F6A0BFAAC711EF8">
Press, struck it off by Hand, sign'd it in Goal and
gave it out by Quantities to my Accomplices, and
some Time afterwards, being in low Circumstances,
two Gentlemen came and paid my Bill of Costs, and
took me out of Goal; soon after I came out of
Confinement, the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Money was found
out to be false, (that is the first Money that I En|graved
for the Gentlemen,) one of them turned
King's Evidence and swore against me for engrav|ing
the Plate, and against his Confederate; but both
got clear by Swearing it upon me; for my Part I
made my Escape and got into <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Go|vernment,
where I met with a Man who I had
known in <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> where I laid concealed for
some Time; he and sundry more came to me, and
desired of me, and intreated of me to cut them a
Plate, which I did and struck off <HI>Twelve Thousand
Pounds,</HI> and divided the Money amongst them, as
I thought proper; and in one Day I changed and
past about <HI>Sixteen Hundred Pounds,</HI> and got good
Money for it; and coming through the Town of
<HI>Providence</HI> one of my Accomplices Wives was ta|ken
up for Counterfeiting Money. I told her be|fore
she should Swear, that she might say she had
the Money from me; and she would never have
been taken up, if she had not taken a Bill clandes|tinely
and Sign'd it herself.</P>
<P>My Partner <HI>Nicholas Stephens</HI> and I, rid about
three Miles out of Town, and divided the good Mo|ney
we had by us, and then parted; he Rid in
Town and there gave himself up as an Evidence,
in behalf of King and Country, and they confin'd
him to Goal; and he brought in seven or eight
<PB N="10" REF="007796_0010_0F6A0BFB75E20D58">
more, who all pleaded not Guilty and swore they
had the Money of me, and received it for good
Money in Trading; and in about a Week after, I
was taken and confin'd to Goal: I was brought
to Examination and pleaded Guilty, and said that
those People that was in Goal I had Cheated in
Trading. I had hid about <HI>Four Thousand Pounds,</HI>
which the Authority demanded of me; I told them
that I would not deliver the Money till they would
deliver, and Discharge the Innocent now Confin'd;
and after they were Discharged, I was brought out
under a Guard and delivered up the Money; soon
after that, I was brought to Tryal and found Guil|ty;
and was Branded in both Cheeks with the
Letter R. and Cropt in both my Ears, so I was
returned to Custody again. I broke out of Goal
and saw <HI>Nicholas Stephens</HI> Cropt and Branded, the
High Sheriff of <HI>Providence</HI> came to me, and desired
of me to return to Prison, for he said he should
loose his Place; with that I went very quietly, and
soon after, on a Monday I broke out of Goal and
went to a Husking Frolick about three Miles out
of Town, and differ'd with the Company, and got
almost Kill'd, and the next Morning returned to
my old Prison again, then I was put in strong Irons
and confined very close; but I soon found Means
to break out again; although they pursu'd me
very close, sent Post haste after me, and did all
they could to Apprehend me; but all in vain, till
I came to <HI>Dutchess</HI> County, in the Province of
<HI>New-York;</HI> and going from House to House, there
was a Person that knew me, and asked if my Name
was not <HI>Syllavan?</HI> No, said I, you are mistaken
in the Person my Friend; and so I went off for fean
<PB N="11" REF="007796_0011_0F6A0BFC28B0C368">
he would betray me; which he did, by describing
my Visage and Apparel, and said, he was sure it
was <HI>Syllavan</HI> the Money-Maker.</P>
<P>Then I provided my self with a secret retreating
Place, at the Side of a Swamp; in a large unfre|quented
Wood: but hearing that some of my Ac|complices
were taken, and expecting they would
betray me, or discover my Habitation. I there|fore
abandoned it, and fled to the Mountains,
where I concealed my self seven Days; till being
compel'd by Hunger, I ventured to a House of
my Acquaintance, hoping they would favour my
Concealment; and having cut a Plank in the
Floor of the House, I dig'd a Cavity under the
Hearth, and had a Fire-place, the Smoke of which
issu'd by a Vent into the Chimney above; I had
not been long conceal'd there, before the House
was surrounded by several Men: so I suffer'd my|self
to be taken, and surrender'd to them. First I
was carried to <HI>New-Haven</HI> Goal, and afterwards
removed to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>During my stay in <HI>Dutchess</HI> County, I made
large Sums of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Money, of six Assort|ments,
and of the <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> Currency <HI>ten
or twelve Thousand Pounds,</HI> and left the Plates
with my Accomplices; of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Money, I
made three Sorts, and printed off about <HI>three
Thousand Pounds,</HI> and lef the Plates with my Ac|complicies;
of <HI>New-York</HI> Currency four Sorts, and
had four different Sett of Accomplices; and there
was four Sorts Counterfeited by my Accomplices,
which I had no Hand in at all; and all of the new
Currency, with the following Signers Names to it,
<PB N="12" REF="007796_0012_0F6A0BFED1C506C8">
viz. <HI>De Lancey, Depuyster,</HI> and Living<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="blotted"> All
my Accomplices deserv'd the Gallows, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="blotted"> as
myself; but I will not betray them, or be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="blotted">uilty
of shedding their Blood.</P>
<P><HI>And then turning to the Spectators, said, well
Gentlemen,</HI> You may all take Warning by me, and look
out for the King of Terrors; and told the Sheriff that
he must needs confess, that he was not willing to die&punc;
Then looking about him, said, I see none of my Ac|complices
here; but I hope they will burn and de|stroy
all the Money, Plates and Accoutrements, that
they have by them, and that they may not die on a
Tree as I do. Then call'd to the Executioner and
said, don't pull the Rope so tight, it is hard for a
Man to die in cold Blood: after which he cried out
<HI>O good GOD! O good GOD!</HI> have Mercy on
my Soul I then said the Lord's Prayer. Iust as
he was turn'd off the Cart, he cry'd, <HI>LORD have
Mercy on my Soul.</HI></P>
