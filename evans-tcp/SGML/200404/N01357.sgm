<P>A Dead Child was once raised
unto Life, by GOD, at the
<HI>Prayer</HI> of an Holy Prophet
unto Him. And in the Rai|sing
of this Child, we read, 2 King. IV.
34. He <HI>lay upon the Child, and</HI> (first)
<PB N="2" REF="001614_0004_0F4D7F3238860820">
<HI>put his Mouth upon his Mouth; and</HI> (then)
<HI>his Eyes upon his Eyes; and</HI> (afterwards)
<HI>his Hands upon his Hands;&mdash;and the
Child opened his Eyes.</HI> We <HI>Pray,</HI> That
the <HI>Souls</HI> of our Children may <HI>Live.</HI> If
we are our Selves the true Children of
<HI>Abraham,</HI> it will appear in this; we
shall importunately. <HI>Pray</HI> to God for
our Children, <HI>Oh! that they may Live in
thy sight!</HI> But <HI>Praying</HI> for them, is not all
we have to do for them. The <HI>Enlive|ning
Word</HI> of God must be applied unto
them. We must apply the <HI>Lively O|racles</HI>
of the Word, unto the <HI>Mouthes,</HI>
and the <HI>Eyes,</HI> and the <HI>Hands</HI> of the
Children. If our God please then to
make an Application of it unto their
<HI>Hearts,</HI> this will cause them to <HI>Live.</HI>
Yea, tho' the Children are <HI>Cast forth
unto the Loathing their Person,</HI> and even+ly
<HI>Dead,</HI> and rotting and stinking in
their Sin; yet, <HI>O Lord, Thou wilt say
unto them, Live; yea, thou wilt say unto
them in their Blood, Live.</HI> There is
is that Excellency in the Word of God,
that it suits <HI>all Ages.</HI> It has <HI>Milk</HI> for
the <HI>Babes,</HI> as well as <HI>Meat</HI> for the
<PB N="3" REF="001614_0005_0F4D7F32EFF69468">
<HI>Strong.</HI> It instructs both the <HI>Old</HI> and
the <HI>Young,</HI> to <HI>Praise the Lord.</HI> You have
here a Psalm, of Lessons to be Learn'd
by <HI>Children;</HI> even as soon as they learn
their Letters. In the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> every
Verse begins with a New Letter, ac|cording
to the Order of the Alphabet;
Perhaps, that so the <HI>Hebrew Children</HI>
might have it as Early as they had
their Alphabet. <HI>Children</HI> are here
called upon. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> is Com|manded
&amp; Commended unto <HI>Children.</HI>
It is here shown unto <HI>children,</HI> what
they are to do, that they may be <HI>Happy
Children.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which I now
gather from it, is;</P>
<P><HI>There are in the Word of God, Good
Lessons for Children;</HI> There are
<HI>Lessons relating to the Fear of God,</HI>
which may be Understood, even by
them who are come to the Least
<HI>Understanding;</HI> which should be Con|siderd
by them that can Use the
<HI>Least Consideration.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001614_0006_0F4D7F33DCF12E00">
<HI>Luther</HI> would say, The <HI>best Preacher</HI>
is he, that Preaches what we call,
<HI>Childishly;</HI> that so accommodates the
Truths of the Gospel, unto his Hearers,
that even the <HI>Little Children</HI> may <HI>mind</HI>
them when they hear them, and grow
sensible of them. I propose at this
Time, to make an Essay at <HI>such Preach|ing;</HI>
and speak such Things, as they
who are in the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Little Children,</HI> &amp;
many Others, who have not much more
<HI>Sense</HI> than they, may take a Good No|tice
of. There are Truths of the Gos|pel,
which may be apprehended by the
<HI>Smallest Capacities;</HI> and by the <HI>Youngest</HI>
that are capable of Minding any thing
in the World. I am now to set such
Things before you, and such <HI>Lessons
relating to the Fear of God,</HI> as may be
apprehended by the very <HI>Children</HI> in
the Congregation; I desire to do it,
in such Plain Terms, that the <HI>Smallest
Capacities</HI> may Entertain the <HI>Lessons of
Piety;</HI> and be Quickened unto the <HI>Fear
of God.</HI> And yet the Things now to
be set before you, will be such, that
the most Illuminated Christians in the
<PB N="5" REF="001614_0007_0F4D7F3682313BC8">
Auditory, and such as are in the highest
Form of Christianity shall hear nothing
but what may be for their Edification
too. Tho' the <HI>Lambs</HI> may Wade in
the <HI>Still Waters,</HI> to which the Shepherd
of their Souls, is now leading of them,
yet they will be such, that the <HI>Elephants</HI>
may also Swim in them. Sirs, Don't count
your selves neglected, in a Discourse
now so adapted unto <HI>Infancy.</HI> But ra|ther
with Shame and Grief make this
Reflection, <HI>Alas, that after so long a
Time, I should be so little improved, as to
need still that the first Elements of Piety
should be inculcated upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Let all our People, attend unto the
Plainest <HI>Maxims of Piety; Hear these,
O all ye People, every one of you!</HI> And let
even the <HI>Weakest</HI> and <HI>Youngest</HI> of our
People, give attention; <HI>Come, ye Chil|dren,
Hearken to me.</HI></P>
<P>1. The <HI>Weakest,</HI> and even the <HI>Youngest</HI>
People, <HI>Children</HI> themselves, while yet
in their Minority, may be Taught,
<HI>That</HI> and <HI>How</HI> the Great <HI>God is to be
Feared,</HI> and what the <HI>Fear of God</HI> will
<PB N="6" REF="001614_0008_0F4D7F3757F3D218">
bring them to. Plainly, They that
are of the <HI>Lowest Capacity</HI> among you,
may know this; <HI>The Great God is He
who Made me, and I ought to Fear and
Serve my Maker!</HI> That plain Lesson is
not above the <HI>Lowest Capacity;</HI> Psal.
LXXVI. 7. <HI>Thou, even thou are to be Fear|ed,
O Lord.</HI> But then, What is implied
in, <HI>The Fear of God?</HI> They that are of
the <HI>Lowest Capacity</HI> may be taught thus
much; <HI>I am to show my Fear of God, by
being afraid of Sinning against Him.</HI> That
Lesson is not above them; Prov. VIII.
13. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is to hate Evil.</HI>
They may be taught thus much; <HI>I am
to show my Fear of God, by being afraid of
having Him Angry with me.</HI> That Lesson
is not above them; Heb. X. 31. <HI>It is a
fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the
Living God.</HI> They may be taught thus
much; <HI>I must Fear God, and fly to my
Saviour, that I may be delivered from the
Wrath of God.</HI> That Lesson is not a|bove
them; Psal. CXLVII. 11. <HI>The Lord
takes Pleasure is those that Fear Him, and
that Hope in His Mercy.</HI> And thus
much may be taught unto them; I
<PB N="7" REF="001614_0009_0F4D7F37C6AFF1D0">
<HI>must Fear God, and I must Chuse the Things
that Please God.</HI> they may Con that
Lesson; Eccl. XII. 13. <HI>Fear God, and keep
His Commandments; for this is the whole
Duty of Man.</HI> These Plain Things
may be instilled into our <HI>Children</HI> them|selves;
and will be so, when they are
<HI>Taught of God.</HI> Well, And, if this <HI>Fear
of God</HI> be in us, what will be the <HI>Issue</HI> of
it? They that are of the <HI>Lowest Capacity</HI>
may be taught thus much; <HI>I shall be no
loser by the Fear of God.</HI> And thus
much, <HI>It is good for me to draw near unto
God.</HI> And thus much, <HI>God is a Re|warder
of them who diligently Seek Him.</HI>
They that are of such a <HI>Low Capacity,</HI>
as to have no other <HI>Wisdom,</HI> yet may be
taught this, <HI>That until we have the Fear
of God, we have no Wisdom at all.</HI> This
<HI>Lesson</HI> is a very Easy one; We may
teach it our <HI>Children;</HI> it was the first
Instruction of <HI>Solomon</HI> unto his, as it had
been the Instruction which his Father
had before given unto him, Prov. 1. 7.
<HI>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of
Wisdom.</HI> Child, Thou dost never be|gin
to be <HI>Wise,</HI> till thou <HI>Fear God;</HI> And
<PB N="8" REF="001614_0010_0F4D7F38B8984FD0">
the <HI>Fear of God</HI> will make thee <HI>Wise un|to
Salvation.</HI> This thou mayest know;
And with the Knowledge thou mayest
attain to something of the <HI>Wisdom.</HI>
There is no Obscurity, no Difficulty,
in this <HI>Lesson;</HI> tis a <HI>Plain Song</HI> that may
be presently learnt; Psal. XXXL. 1st.
<HI>Oh! how great is thy Goodness, which thou
hast laid up for them that Fear thee.</HI> The
<HI>Promises</HI> which the <HI>Conenant of God</HI>
makes to them that <HI>Fear Him,</HI> as they
are very <HI>Great,</HI> so they are very Plain
Promises. Tis <HI>Plainly</HI> Promised, and
very Intelligibly Declared, so that our
poor <HI>Children</HI> themselves may be affect|ed
with the Declaration; <Q>Child, <HI>Fear
God;</HI> Resolve to be Religious; and
Walk in the ways of His Religion;
Then, thou shalt find, <HI>As a Father Pi|ties
his Children, so the Lord Pities them
that Fear Him;</HI> and will Pardon their
Sins. Thou shalt find, <HI>The Sun of Righ|teousness
will arise with Healing in His
Wings, to them that Fear His Name.</HI>
Thou shalt find, <HI>The Lord will fulfil the
Desire of them that Fear Him.</HI> Thou
shalt find, <HI>The Angel of the Lord En|camps
<PB N="9" REF="001614_0011_0F4D7F39219F8370">
about them that Fear Him.</HI> Thou
shalt find, <HI>The Fear of the Lord will be a
Fountain of Life.</HI> Thou shalt find,
<HI>When the Time of the Dead comes, that
they shall be Iudged, God will give a Re|ward
unto all that Fear His Name.</HI></Q>
These are no <HI>Dark Sayings.</HI> People
of the <HI>Lowest Capacity</HI> may be apprised
of these Things. When they are so,
then they are <HI>taught the Fear of the Lord!</HI></P>
<P>11. The <HI>Weakest,</HI> &amp; even the <HI>Youngest</HI>
People, and our <HI>Children</HI> while yet but
<HI>Infants,</HI> may be taught, <HI>That</HI> there are
<HI>Evil Practices,</HI> which will prove Dan|gerous
to them; and <HI>What</HI> are those
<HI>Evil Practices.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will
cause People to Shun those <HI>Evil Practi|ces,</HI>
which are Condemned in the <HI>Word
of God.</HI> Even People of the <HI>Lowest Ca|pacity</HI>
may be taught that <HI>Lesson;</HI> Job
XXVIII. 28. <HI>Behold, The Fear of the
Lord, that is Wisdom; and to Depart from
Evil is Vnderstanding.</HI> Be the <HI>Capacity</HI>
of People, never so <HI>Ordinary,</HI> yet they
have something of the Divine <HI>Law</HI>
Written upon their Hearts; The <HI>Finger</HI>
<PB REF="001614_0012_0F4D7F3A15F08BF0">
of God has Written something of the
<HI>Law</HI> on the <HI>Fleshly Tables.</HI> A <HI>Conscience</HI>
will betimes begin to Work, in the
Children of Men. A <HI>Conscience</HI> will
tell them, while they are vet in their
Childhood, that such and such Things
are <HI>Evil Things,</HI> and that the <HI>Wrath of
God will come on the Children of Diso|bedience,</HI>
who do such Things. Let the
<HI>Capacity</HI> of People be never so <HI>Low,</HI> yet
they may learn this Lesson; <HI>I must not
Venture to do any thing that is Condemend
by the Light of God in my Soul.</HI> That
Lesson is not <HI>too High</HI> for the <HI>Lowest
Capacity;</HI> Job XXIV. 13. Wicked Men,
<HI>They are of those that Rebel against the
Light.</HI> But there are many special
Cautions in the Word of God, which
may be bro't unto People of the <HI>Lowest
Capacity;</HI> and it will he found, that
their <HI>Conscience</HI> will agree to them;
&amp; so it will be found the <HI>Lessons</HI> will not
be above them. All the <HI>Ten Command|ments</HI>
are such Things; They are Cal|culated
for the Lowest Capacity Our
<HI>Children</HI> may betimes learn the Ten
<HI>Commandment&punc;</HI> What is Forbidden and
<PB N="11" REF="001614_0013_0F4D7F3A75C8C0C8">
What is <HI>Required</HI> in the <HI>Ten Command|ments.</HI>
In the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> there
is done, what we read; Psal. LXXVIII. 5.
<HI>God has appointed a Law, which He Com|manded
our Fathers, that they should make
them known unto their Children.</HI> It
would be a Sad Thing, if any Child of
<HI>Seven Years</HI> Old, should be so Unculti|vated,
as to be Unable to say, the <HI>Ten
Commandments,</HI> or to be Ignorant, what
that <HI>Fear of God</HI> is, which is taught in
the <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>But we may Specify several Points,
in which People of a very <HI>Mean Capaci|ty</HI>
may be taught that <HI>Fear of God,</HI> which
is to be Expressed in the avoiding of
some <HI>Evil Practices.</HI></P>
<P>First. <HI>People of Low Degree,</HI> You may
learn this Lesson in the <HI>Fear of God;
The Name of God must always be treated
Awfully, and Holily, and Seriously; and
have an awful Respect Paid unto it.</HI> You
must not use the <HI>Name</HI> of the Glorious
GOD, Vainly, Lightly, Irreverently.
You must not <HI>Swear Prosantly</HI> by the
<HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Lasty One.</HI> You
must not <HI>Test</HI> on or with the Word of
<PB N="12" REF="001614_0014_0F4D7F3B761DA340">
the Great GOD. When you are En|gaged
in the Worship of God, you must
behave your selves, as in the Presence
of the <HI>Great King, whose Name is Dread|ful.</HI>
No <HI>Sleeping,</HI> and no <HI>Sporting,</HI> is to
be indulged in the <HI>Assembly's,</HI> wherein
God is <HI>Greatly to be feared, and had in
Reverence.</HI> These are very Evident
Things. Tis a plain Lesson; <HI>O Lord,
They are thine Enemy's, who take thy Name
in Vain.</HI> Children, You can reach to
that Lesson; Deut. XXVIII. 58, 59. <HI>If
thou wilt not fear this Glorious &amp; Fearful
Name,</HI> THE LORD THY GOD, <HI>the
Lord will make thy Plagues Wonderful.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. They must be very Sense|less
indeed, who can't learnt this Lesson
in the <HI>Fear of God; I must not Abuse the
Good Creatures of God; nor abuse any Self
in the Vse of them.</HI> Every Body knows,
That our <HI>Drink,</HI> and our <HI>Meat,</HI> and our
<HI>Cloathing,</HI> are the <HI>Good Creatures</HI> of God.
It may therefore be soon known, by our
very <HI>Children</HI> themselves, That it is a
Wicked Thing to <HI>Drink too much;</HI> It is
a Brutish Thing to <HI>Eat too much;</HI> God
has not given us our Apparel, to hang
<PB N="13" REF="001614_0015_0F4D7F3C84810BB0">
out the <HI>Flags of Pride,</HI> and gratify our
<HI>Vanity.</HI> Children, This Lesson is not
beyond you; Rom. XIII. 13, 14. <HI>Let us
Walk Honestly; not in rioting &amp; drunken|ness;
Put on the Lord Iesus Christ, and
make not Provision for the Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There is this Lesson in the
<HI>Fear of God,</HI> which every one may learn,
as soon as 'tis possible; <HI>The Lord's Day
must be kept Holy to the Lord; the Sabbaths
of the Lord must be the Lord's.</HI> Our <HI>Chil|dren</HI>
themselves, can't but soon perceive,
that we distinguish <HI>One Day in Seven</HI> for
the peculiar Service of God. When
the <HI>Passover</HI> was instituted, it was then
supposed; <HI>It shall come to pass, Your Chil|dren
shall say to you, What mean you by this
Service?</HI> On the Institution of the <HI>Lord's
Day,</HI> we may soon inform our <HI>Children,
What we mean by the Service.</HI> Even
these, and they who cannot Compre|hend
any more than these, may be in|formed;
<Q>The Glorious God having
Made the World is <HI>Six Day, &amp; Rested
on the Seventh,</HI> He has allow'd us to
Work in the world <HI>Six Days,</HI> but Com|manded
us to <HI>Rest</HI> from doing so, that
<PB N="14" REF="001614_0016_0F4D7F3F4B3AC568">
we be Wholly for Him on the <HI>Seventh.</HI>
And our Saviour JESUS, <HI>Rising from
the Dead,</HI> on this Day, we ought this
Day to Remember, that He now ap|peared
our <HI>Victorious Redeemer.</HI> By
spending this Day in Communion with
God, we prepare for the <HI>Rest</HI> which
<HI>remains for His People,</HI> at the <HI>Resurrecti|on
of the Dead;</HI> but if we Mispend
this Day, we deserve to <HI>fall short of
Entring into the Rest of God.</HI></Q>&mdash;The
Lesson is quickly learnt; Lev. XIX. 30.
<HI>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence
My Sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> has this
Lesson in it, than which there can be
nothing more easy to learn; <HI>Parents
must be Obey'd; God will not bear to see
Parents Wrong'd and Griev'd by a Disobe|dient
Off-spring.</HI> Where are the Chil|dren
so <HI>Blockish,</HI> as not to be aware of
this? <HI>Children</HI> owe much <HI>Obedience</HI> to
their <HI>Parents. Disobedient,</HI> Disinge|nuous,
Disobliging <HI>Children,</HI> know them|selves
to be, what they ought not to be.
<HI>Vndutiful Children,</HI> are <HI>Self-Condemned,</HI>
and know that they do not their Duty.
<PB N="15" REF="001614_0017_0F4D7F405CEDF9B0">
<HI>Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Reverence,</HI> and <HI>Recom|pence</HI>
to <HI>Parents,</HI> one would think, there
should scarce be any Need of teaching
them. There is no <HI>Mystery</HI> in this
Matter; Tis no Sublime abstruse No|tion;
Tis not a Deep Thing that
cannot be fathomed; The short Arm
of a Child may fathom it; <HI>Honour thy
Father and thy Mother, that thy Days
may be long in the Land.</HI> By that time
the <HI>Child shall have Knowledge to Cry,
My Father, or my Mother,</HI> it may have this
<HI>Knowledge</HI> with it, <HI>I must do, as my Father,
and as my Mother bids me!</HI> Ere the <HI>Chil|dren</HI>
go off our Knees, we may learn
them this Lesson; Eph. VI 1. <HI>Children,
Obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is
right.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. They must be very Stupid,
unto whom this Lesson in the <HI>Fear of:
God,</HI> is not a very fair one; <HI>I may Med|dle
with nothing but what is my own, or with
the leave of the Owner.</HI> Tis nothing but
what our very <HI>Children</HI> may be aware
of; That it is a Crime to <HI>Steal.</HI> Every
one may come to the Knowledge or
this; If you <HI>Wrongfully take</HI> a Peny from
<PB N="16" REF="001614_0018_0F4D7F407418CAC0">
another, tis a Crime that you are guilty
of. If you <HI>rob an Orchard,</HI> you have the
Guilt of a Crime lying on you. If you
<HI>Cheat</HI> any one in your dealing with
him, there is a Crime in the <HI>Fraud.</HI> It
is a Criminal Thing, to <HI>Encroach</HI> on the
Propriety of a Neighbour. These are
such Obvious Things, our very <HI>Children</HI>
may and should be acquainted with
them. There is nothing in all this,
but what any body in the World may
be advised of. Tis a Lesson which
there is no Trouble in learning of: Jer.
11. 26. <HI>A Thief is ashamed, when he is found.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly. There is this Lesson in the
<HI>Fear of God,</HI> which all may learn, even
as soon as they can speak; <HI>To tell a Lye
is to do a base thing; A Lying Tongue is
an Abomination to the Lord.</HI> There
needs no Pains to insinuate this, into
the dullest Minds that we can Meet
withal; It should be your care <HI>always
to speak the Truth.</HI> You must be <HI>Chil|dren
that will not Lye,</HI> else the Lord will
not be <HI>your Saviour.</HI> No Minds are of
such a Dulness, that they can't be Con|vinced
of this; You must have a Care
<PB N="17" REF="001614_0019_0F4D7F414F5A2148">
of <HI>Lying.</HI> While we have our <HI>Children,</HI>
but as <HI>Chickens</HI> yet under our Wings,
we may easily infuse this into them;
You must never tell a <HI>Lye;</HI> Tis a Vile
Thing to tell a <HI>Lye;</HI> If you have done
a <HI>Fault,</HI> you must not cover it with a
<HI>Lye;</HI> Such a Covering will but make
you yet <HI>More Faulty</HI> than you were be|fore.
It won't require May Strokes
to beat this Truth into the <HI>Children.</HI>
By that time the <HI>Child shall know to re|fuse
the Evil, and abuse the Good,</HI> it may
know, that <HI>Lying</HI> is to be <HI>Abhorred;</HI>
and the <HI>Liar</HI> shall be <HI>forsaken</HI> of all his
Friends. Tis a Lesson, that can hard|ly
come too soon; Eph. Iv. 25. <HI>Put a|way
Lying; Speak the Truth, every one
with his Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly. And who is there, to
whom this Lesson in the <HI>Fear of God,</HI>
will be Unintelligible? <HI>I must wish Ill
unto none; but as far as I can do Good unto
all.</HI> There are those, who may Confess,
<HI>I have not the Vnderstanding of a Man; I
have not learned Wisdom, nor have I the
Knowledge of the Holy Ones.</HI> But yet e|ven
these, may come to so much <HI>Vn|derstanding,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001614_0020_0F4D7F43AED0E8B8">
and so much <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and
so much <HI>Knowledge,</HI> as this; You should
<HI>hurt no body;</HI> You should be <HI>harmless</HI> and
<HI>blameless;</HI> You should be Glad, when
your Neighbour sees <HI>Prosperity,</HI> and en|joys
Good Things, and not Enviously
Wish, that you had them from him.
You shou'd be Griev'd when your Neigh|bour
is in <HI>Advorsity,</HI> and be ready to
help him against any Bad Things that
may threaten him. These are <HI>Dictates</HI>
which cannot be Question'd; It may be
said, <HI>These things cannot be spoken against.</HI>
Our very <HI>Children</HI> may take in such
things as these. This is a Lesson that
any one may learn, under the <HI>Nurture
and Admonition of the Lord;</HI> Rom. XII.
10. <HI>Be kindly affectioned one to another, in
Brotherly Love.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! If our <HI>Children,</HI> and the People
of the <HI>Lowest Capacities,</HI> would come &amp;
hearken to us, in such Plain Things, as
these, they would be <HI>taught the Fear of
the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>111. The <HI>Weakest,</HI> and even the
<HI>Youngest</HI> People, our <HI>Children</HI> soon after
<PB N="19" REF="001614_0021_0F4D7F4431528E70">
they have done hanging on <HI>the Breast;</HI>
May be taught, <HI>That</HI> their <HI>Conversion</HI> to
God is necessary, and <HI>What</HI> they will do,
if ever they come to be <HI>Converted.</HI> The
<HI>Fear of God</HI> will imply a Sincere and
Thorough <HI>Conversion</HI> unto Him: it will
bring People to do those things, which
are done by none but those that are
<HI>Converted</HI> unto God. The People of
the <HI>Lowest Capacity,</HI> may &amp; should Con|cern
themselves, about the <HI>Grand Con|cern</HI>
of a <HI>Real Conversion.</HI> Our <HI>Children</HI>
themselves, tho' it be not long since
they were <HI>Weaned,</HI> yet, supposing they
can act Reasonably, they will not <HI>Exer|cise
themselves in things too high for them,</HI>
if they are Exercised about the <HI>Great
Matters</HI> of their <HI>Conversion</HI> to God; It
will be but a Reasonable Thing of them
to think often on this; <HI>What shall I do
if I am Converted unto God?</HI> And, <HI>What
will become of me, if I am not Converted
unto God?</HI></P>
<P>Be the <HI>Capacity</HI> of the People, in the
Lowest Class that can be; yet the <HI>Chil|dren</HI>
may be taught, some things of the
<HI>Greatest importance</HI> for all <HI>the People</HI> in
<PB N="20" REF="001614_0022_0F4D7F462A2D5918">
the World. That <HI>Vast Concern,</HI> of <HI>Con|version</HI>
to God, is to be indeed address'd
at this rate, <HI>Hear this, All ye People, Give
Ear, All ye inhabitants of the World; Both
Low and High, Rich and Poor together.</HI>
Truly, <HI>Low</HI> People, and <HI>Poor</HI> People, and
<HI>Young</HI> People, and All that have Souls
to look after, are to be called upon, thus
to look after their Souls. Indeed, the
<HI>Highest</HI> &amp; the <HI>Richest</HI> upon Earth, have
infinite cause to be Sollicitous on this
Greatest of all Occasions. To <HI>You,</HI> Sirs,
it must be said; If you Die Uncon|verted
unto the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> be your
other <HI>Excellencies</HI> what they will, yet
you <HI>die without Wisdom.</HI> And then;
Tho' a Man have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to <HI>Go|vern</HI>
&amp; <HI>Manage</HI> Whole Nations of Men,
if he <HI>die without this Wisdom,</HI> How art
thou <HI>fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son
of the Morning,</HI> who didst <HI>Order the Na|tions?</HI>
Tho' a Man have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to
Understand as <HI>Many Languages</HI> as a
<HI>Mithridates,</HI> or a <HI>Mordecai;</HI> if he <HI>die
without this Wisdom,</HI> he must be Lodg'd
where he shall gnaw his Tongue for
Pain, and know no Speech but that of
<PB N="21" REF="001614_0023_0F4D7F4692A39B40">
Roaring and Blasphemy. Tho' a Man
have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to Understand as <HI>Ma|ny
Sciences</HI> as an <HI>Alsted,</HI> or a <HI>Scaliger,</HI> if
he <HI>die without this Wisdom,</HI> he must go
into Utter Darkness, and know nothing
but his own Unutterable increase of
Sorrow. A Man may have the <HI>Wis|dom</HI>
to Calculate the Motions of the
Heavens, and yet Unconverted unto
the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> he will be turn'd into
<HI>Hell</HI> after all. But I must not forget,
the Small Folks with whom I am now
Concern'd. We read concerning, <HI>The
First Principles of the Oracles of God,</HI> which
<HI>they that have need of Milk,</HI> should have
taught unto them; and we find, Heb.
VI. 1. <HI>Repentance from Dead Works, and
Faith towards God,</HI> are some of those <HI>Prin|ciples.</HI>
Verily, our <HI>Children</HI> that <HI>have
need of Milk,</HI> are to be taught these
things; You must <HI>Repent</HI> of your Sin a|gainst
God, and you must <HI>Believe</HI> in God
your Saviour; else you <HI>Dy</HI> and Perish
Wonderfully.</P>
<P>First; <HI>Children,</HI> You are to be thus
Taught in the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> such a Les|son
as this; <HI>If I do not in Time and in
<PB N="22" REF="001614_0024_0F4D7F478A3A2A00">
Truth Turn unto God, I shall dy in my Sins;
and, Oh! Miserable my Death, if it find
me so!</HI> Tis a Plain Lesson, Mat. XVIII. 3.
<HI>Except ye be Converetd, and become as Lit|tle
Children, ye shall not enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Even our <HI>Little
Children</HI> themselves may Learn this
Lesson; <HI>Without Conversion I shall be shut
out of Heaven.</HI> Tis a Plain Lesson;
Joh. III. 3. <HI>Except a Man be born again,
he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</HI> Even
our <HI>Children</HI> within a few Years after
they are <HI>First-born,</HI> may learn this Les|son;
<HI>If I am not New-born, I shall find it
good for me that I had never been born at
all.</HI> They that are but <HI>Little Creatures,</HI>
and such as are very Shallow ones, yet
may drink in this Lesson of God; <HI>I
must be a New Creature; or else He that
Made me will not have Mercy on me.</HI> Our
very <HI>Children</HI> may soon Learn this;
That if they be <HI>Wicked Children,</HI> they are
<HI>Cursed Children;</HI> That if they are <HI>Vn|godly
Children,</HI> they are not the <HI>Children
of God;</HI> That if they are not the <HI>Children
of God,</HI> they are the <HI>Children of Satan;</HI>
That <HI>Satans Children</HI> are all <HI>Slaves,</HI> &amp;
<PB N="23" REF="001614_0025_0F4D7F47F5388AD0">
shall be thrown into the same <HI>Fire,</HI> with
the <HI>Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Go on, <HI>Children,</HI> and be
Taught, for you may be so, what is done
<HI>for,</HI> and what is done <HI>by,</HI> them that are
by <HI>Conversion</HI> bro't unto the <HI>Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>More Particularly.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> They that are not got beyond
the Capacity of <HI>Children,</HI> may be taught
this Lesson; <HI>I cannot of my self Turn unto
God; I must Cry unto God, that He would
Graciously Turn me to Himself.</HI> You must
be very Sottish indeed; you are <HI>Stones,</HI>
and no Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> if you
don't feel your selves Unable to <HI>Turn</HI>
your Selves. But we read of one be|moaning
himself; Jer. XXXI. 18. <HI>I have
been as a Bullock unaccustomed unto the Toke;
Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; For
thou art the Lord my God.</HI> It follows,
<HI>This is a dear Son, a pleasant Child, I
will surely have Mercy on him.</HI> Ah, Dear
Children; If ever God <HI>Surely have Mercy</HI>
on you, He will bring you to this; You
will see that you shall never come un|der
the <HI>Yoke of Obedience</HI> to Him, till
He bring you to it. And then, as
<PB N="24" REF="001614_0026_0F4D7F4A08A5C2A8">
<HI>Young</HI> as you are, you will Cry out, <HI>Oh!
Turn thou me, my God; Oh! Turn thou
me, that I may be turned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> They that are not got be|yond
the Capacity of <HI>Children,</HI> may be
taught this Lesson; <HI>Wo is unto me, that I
have Sinned; I am in a Woful, because I
am in a Sinful Condition.</HI> If you are but
as <HI>Children,</HI> yet you may see, The Sin
of your <HI>First Father is Your Sin.</HI> Yet
you may see, The Sin of your <HI>Vile Na|ture,</HI>
has in it <HI>All Sin.</HI> Yet you may
see, That your <HI>Sins</HI> are indeed without
Number; <HI>Innumerable Evils Compassing
of you,</HI> more than the <HI>Hairs of your
Heads.</HI> Yet you may see, That for
your Sins you have the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> a|biding
on you. Yet you may see, the
<HI>Image</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> defiling of you; the <HI>Power</HI>
of <HI>Satan</HI> Enslaving of you; the Devour|ing
Pit ready to Swallow you up. As
<HI>Young</HI> as you are, you may be taught
that Cry; Luk. XVIII. 13. <HI>God be Mer|ciful
to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> They that are not got
beyond the Capacity of <HI>Children,</HI>
may be taught this Lesson; <HI>There is a
Saviour willing to receive me,</HI> and relieve
<PB N="25" REF="001614_0027_0F4D7F4AE09B3AA0">
me; <HI>and if I would be Saved, I must come
unto Him.</HI> The Eternal Son of God,
who dwells in our JESUS, took <HI>Little
Children,</HI> into His Arms, and <HI>Blessed</HI>
them: Oh! <HI>Children Blessed indeed!</HI> And
<HI>You</HI> too, may be so. He added, Mat.
XIX. 14. <HI>Suffer Little Children to come
unto Me; for of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven.</HI> Ah, <HI>Little Children,</HI> You may
come unto your Saviour. If you can
take notice of what is now spoken, you
may come to this Thought, <HI>There is a</HI>
JESUS, <HI>who Saves His People from their
Sins.</HI> You may come to this Thought;
<HI>My</HI> JESUS <HI>is able to Save unto the Vt|termost,
all that come unto Him.</HI> You
may come to this Thought; <HI>My</HI> JE|SUS
<HI>will Cast out none that come unto Him.</HI>
As <HI>Young</HI> as you are, you may then come
into such Thoughts and such Cries as
these; <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver
my Soul; O my Saviour, Bind up my Soul
in the Bundle of Life! O my Saviour, Let
thy Blood Cleanse me from all my Sin! O
my Saviour, Guide me by thy Counsel, and
bring me to thy Glory!</HI> If you can request
any Person to do you any Kindness,
<PB N="26" REF="001614_0028_0F4D7F4AF6D6CD98">
can you not make this Request unto
the Blessed Jesus, <HI>O my Saviour, Take me
into thy Precious Hands.</HI> If you can ask
for <HI>Bread</HI> when you are Hungry, or for
<HI>Help</HI> when you are Uneasy; Cannot
you as well say, <HI>O my Saviour, I am
distressed, undertake for me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Tho' you are not got be|yond
the Capacity of <HI>Children,</HI> yet you
may be taught this Lesson; <HI>I must Re|solve
to Live an Holy Life, and be fixed
in my Resolutions.</HI> We read of such a
thing as that; Jer. III. 4. <HI>Wilt thou not
from this Time Cry unto me, My Father,
Thou art the Guide of my Youth?</HI> Why,
Tho' you are yet in your <HI>Youth, Young</HI>
in <HI>Years,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Young</HI> and Weak
in every thing; Yet you may Resolve,
<HI>The Great God shall be my God for ever
and ever, and my Guide even unto Death.</HI>
It was the Counsel; 1 Joh. V. 21. <HI>Lit|tle
Children, Keep your selves from Idols.</HI>
As <HI>Young</HI> as you are, <HI>Little Children,</HI>
you may Resolve, <HI>I will not Sin to Please
the Flesh, I will not Sin to Gain the World,
I will not hearken to the Sinful Motions of
the Devil.</HI> Of a <HI>Little</HI> Child we are
<PB N="27" REF="001614_0029_0F4D7F4BC068C068">
told; 1 King. XIV. 13. <HI>In him there is
found some Good Thing towards the Lord
God of Israel.</HI> As <HI>Young</HI> as you are, tho'
not beyond a <HI>Little Child,</HI> You may Re|solve;
<HI>I will above all things desire to Know
God, and Serve God, and be in Good Terms
with God, and Vphold Communion with
God; And I will place my Happiness in
these things.</HI> We read of <HI>Children walk|ing
in the Truth.</HI> Even <HI>Children</HI> may
Resolve to take such a <HI>Walk,</HI> as is di|rected
by the <HI>Truth</HI> of God. We read
of being <HI>Followers of God as Obedient Chil|dren.</HI>
Even <HI>Children</HI> may Resolve to
<HI>Follow God,</HI> in imitating the <HI>Example</HI> of
the Holy One. And so Resolved, our
<HI>Young</HI> People, and such as are of a <HI>Low
Capacity,</HI> they may keep Constant in these
Resolutions; Their Constancy may be
Perpetual; They may begin Betimes,
and hold out unto the End.</P>
<P>IV. The <HI>Weakest,</HI> and even the
<HI>Youngest</HI> People, <HI>Children</HI> soon after their
first <HI>going alone;</HI> may be taught, <HI>That</HI>
there are Certain <HI>Duties</HI> wherein they
are to <HI>Walk with God;</HI> and <HI>What</HI> those
<PB N="28" REF="001614_0030_0F4D7F4DB6F18188">
Duties are, and <HI>How</HI> to be Managed,
<HI>How</HI> to be Performed. The <HI>Fear of
God</HI> will put People upon Certain <HI>Du|ties,</HI>
wherein God is to be Glorified. It
was the Wish, Deut. V. 29. <HI>O that they
would fear Me, and keep all My Command|ments
always, that it might be well with
them, and with their Children for ever.</HI>
There are <HI>Commandements,</HI> in Confor|mity
to which, the <HI>Fear of God</HI> will up|hold
a <HI>Walk with God;</HI> and they are so
Plain, that our <HI>Children</HI> themselves may
Conform unto them. Two or Three
of them shall be intimated.</P>
<P>First. There is <HI>Prayer to God;</HI> they
that are yet but in the Capacity of
<HI>Children,</HI> may do something at it; may
<HI>Pray without Ceasing.</HI> It is a Lesson
which any one of you all may learn;
there is nothing impracticable in it by
the <HI>Lowest Capacity;</HI> Mat. VI. 6. <HI>Enter
into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy
Door, Pray to thy Father which is in Se|cret.</HI>
Say not, my Child, <HI>I know not
how to Pray.</HI> What? Hast thou fallen
into so many <HI>Sins,</HI> and canst thou not
<HI>Pray, For thy Names sake, Lord, Pardon
<PB N="29" REF="001614_0031_0F4D7F4E203FA938">
my Iniquity, for it is Great!</HI> Hast thou
so many <HI>Ails</HI> in thy Soul, &amp; canst thou
not <HI>Pray, Lord, Heal my Soul, for I
have Sinned against thee!</HI> Dost thou so
much need a <HI>New Heart,</HI> and canst thou
not <HI>Pray, Lord, Create in me a Clean
Heart, and Renew a Right Spirit within
me!</HI> Art thou <HI>Dying</HI> every Day, and
canst thou not Pray, <HI>Lord, Let not my
Death overtake me, before I have begun
to Live unto God?</HI> Dost thou know of no
<HI>Mischiefs,</HI> which thou art afraid of?
Dost thou know of no <HI>Mercies</HI> worth
asking for? Consult the Book of <HI>Psalms;</HI>
Consult the State of thy <HI>own Soul;</HI> and
thou canst not be such an <HI>awkward Thing,</HI>
as to have nothing to say on thy Knees
before the Lord.</P>
<P>Secondly. You have the <HI>Word of God;</HI>
they that are yet but in the Capacity
of <HI>Children,</HI> may perceive whose <HI>Word</HI>
it is; that they have <HI>God</HI> speaking to
them in it. He was a <HI>Young Child,</HI> who
when the <HI>Word</HI> of God called upon
him, said; 1 Sam. III. 10. Lord, <HI>Speak,
for thy Servant heareth.</HI> One must be
more Silly than a Child in the School-boyes
<PB N="30" REF="001614_0032_0F4D7F4F207BC7D8">
boyes Cloathes, who Paies no Regard
unto the <HI>Word of God.</HI> There is in this
Word, that which the <HI>Angels themselves
desire to look into;</HI> and there is that
which be speaks Regards from the <HI>Low|est
Capacity. Children,</HI> As soon as you
can Read, you may take the Bible, and
in Reading of it, think, <HI>This is the Voice
of God; God now Speaks unto me.</HI> When
you hear Sermons from the Ministers
of God, you have to do with God in
their Ministry, and may think; <HI>Here
are Messages from God; God now Speaks
unto me.</HI> The Lesson is a short one; <HI>I
will bear what God the Lord will Speak!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. They that are yet got no
further than the Capacity of <HI>Children,</HI>
have a <HI>Lesson</HI> to learn, which their <HI>Du|ty
to their Neighour</HI> is Comprized in.
The <HI>Way-faring Ones,</HI> tho' <HI>Feels,</HI> need
not <HI>Err,</HI> in the Way of their <HI>Duty to
their Neighbour;</HI> Let them only keep
to that plain Rule; Mat. VII. 12. <HI>All
things whatsoever ye would, that Men
should do to you, do ye even so to them.
Children</HI> themselves would forbear ma|ny
<HI>an Ill Thing</HI> towards another, if they
<PB N="31" REF="001614_0033_0F4D7F4F91181D28">
would but think; <HI>Should I be willing, to
have such a thing done by another to me?
Children</HI> themselves would be ready to
do a <HI>Good Thing</HI> unto another in Distress,
if they would but think; <HI>Would not I
be glad, if such a thing might be done by a|nother
to me?</HI> And, <HI>Children,</HI> You are
not of such a <HI>Low Capacity,</HI> that you
can't form such Thoughts as these.</P>
<P>V. There are some Religious and A|wakening
<HI>Meditations,</HI> with which the
<HI>Weakest,</HI> and the <HI>Youngest</HI> of us all, and
People of the <HI>Lowest Capacities,</HI> may A|waken
themselves unto the <HI>Fear of God.</HI>
There are Certain <HI>Meditations</HI> which
have a Notable Tendency to Enkindle
the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in the Souls of Men.
Tho' People are of never such <HI>Low Ca|pacities,</HI>
yet they can form such <HI>Medi|tations.</HI>
The <HI>Children</HI> that Play in the
Streets, may leave their Play, and fall
into such <HI>Meditations.</HI> Children, Where|ever
you are, and as <HI>Young</HI> as you are,
You may think; <HI>The Eye of God is now
upon me; God hears all that I Say; God is
acquainted with all my Ways.</HI> Add to this;
<PB N="32" REF="001614_0034_0F4D7F50686AB1E8">
It is said, Gal. III. 27. <HI>As many of you
as have been Baptised into Christ have put
en Christ.</HI> Children, When once you have
been told, that you have been <HI>Baptised,</HI>
which ought to be very Early, You
should think, <HI>What was I Baptised for?
I was bound in my Baptism to the Service of
my Saviour. I have been Washed in His
Name, and I shall do a Dirty thing, if I Sin
against my Saviour.</HI> Again; Our Savi|our
sayes; Mat. XI. 28, 29. <HI>Come unto
Me, and Learn of Me.</HI> When you are
going to <HI>School,</HI> you may think; <HI>My
Saviour is willing to be my Tuter; O my
dear Saviour, I will come &amp; Learn of Thee.
None teaches like to thee.</HI> Once more;
We read; 1 King. XIV. 17. <HI>The Child
died.</HI> You see <HI>Children</HI> carried unto
their Graves: In the Burying-place
you see Graves not longer than you
are. How lately have you seen a <HI>Love|ly
Flowre</HI> Cropt? You may now think;
<HI>I may Dy as Young as I am. I know not
the Day of my Death. Lord, Make me
Ready for it.</HI> Moreover, We read, Rev.
XX. 12. <HI>I saw the Dead, Small and Great
Stand before God.</HI> You may <HI>Lodge</HI> such
<PB N="33" REF="001614_0035_0F4D7F50F1FD9F68">
Thoughts as these, and throw away
your <HI>Vain</HI> Ones; <HI>I must One Day ap|pear
before the Iudgment-Seat of God. As
Little as I am, I shall not be left Vncon|sidered
by the Glorious Iudge of the World.</HI>
Carry on the Thoughts; Think; <HI>If I
Fear God, I shall for ever be With the
Lord, and be unspeakably Blessed in His
Heavenly Places.</HI> Think; <HI>If I have not
the Fear of God, I shall be thrown into a
place of Torment; and an Everlasting Pu|nishment
will be my Portion.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you have had <HI>Lessons relating to
the Fear of God</HI> Plainly set before you;
Such Lessons, and so <HI>Plainly</HI> offered, that
People of the <HI>Lowest Capacity</HI> may <HI>Vn|derstand</HI>
them and <HI>Consider</HI> them.</P>
<P>There are Two Remarks, which I
have now to make upon them.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section" N="1">
<HEAD>The First Remark.</HEAD>
<P>We cannot be Satisfied, that our
People of the <HI>Lowest Capacity,</HI> and Par|ticularly
our <HI>Children,</HI> should remain
Strangers to the <HI>Fear of God. Children,</HI>
As <HI>Young</HI> as you are, 'tis not <HI>too Soon</HI> for
<PB N="34" REF="001614_0036_0F4D7F525BA9C598">
you to <HI>Dy;</HI> 'tis not <HI>too Soon</HI> for you to
fall into a <HI>Damnation that Slumbers
not;</HI> 'tis not <HI>too Soon</HI> for you to Mind
what you are <HI>a doing,</HI> and where you
are <HI>a going.</HI> Then 'tis not <HI>too Soon</HI> for
you to <HI>Fear God;</HI> 'tis not <HI>too Soon</HI> for you
to <HI>Vnderstand</HI> and <HI>Consider,</HI> what you
have to <HI>Know</HI> and to <HI>Do</HI> in the <HI>Fear of
God.</HI> We read, Isa. XXVIII. 9. <HI>Whom
shall He teach Knowledge? And whom shall
He make to Vnderstand Doctrine? Them
that are Weaned from the Milk, &amp; Drawn
from the Breasts.</HI> Truly, E're you have
been any long time <HI>Weaned from the
Milk, and Drawn from the Breasts,</HI> you
may be <HI>Taught</HI> the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> and you
may <HI>Mind</HI> what you are <HI>Taught.</HI> Oh!
When shall it be said of our <HI>Children,
Behold, they Pray!</HI> When will our <HI>Chil|dren</HI>
answer all Temptation to Sin, <HI>How
shall I do this Wickedness, and Sin against
God!</HI> When will our <HI>Children</HI> make that
Enquiry, <HI>What shall I do to be Saved?</HI> O
our <HI>Children,</HI> and You also that in your
<HI>Capacity</HI> are not better than <HI>Children;</HI> to
YOU is this Lesson sent; <HI>Acquaint your
selves now with God; thereby Good shall
come unto you!</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section" N="2">
<PB N="35" REF="001614_0037_0F4D7F5271335E10">
<HEAD>The Second Remark.</HEAD>
<P>Then People of an <HI>Higher Capacity,</HI> &amp;
such as have Out-grown the Years and
Wits of <HI>Children,</HI> are most <HI>Inexcusable,</HI> if
they should persist without the <HI>Fear of
God.</HI> It was a sharp Censure and <HI>Satyr</HI>
upon some; 1 Cor. III. 1. <HI>I could not
speak unto you, but as unto Babes.</HI> But
it must come with a greater Sharpness,
if it may be said, <HI>You have not so much
Fear of God in you, as might be expected in
Babes.</HI> Alas, It would be <HI>Inexcusable</HI>
in our <HI>Children,</HI> if they should Know
and Do no better, than many People
who pretend unto the Years of Discre|tion.
O You that are come to some
<HI>Forwardness,</HI> and it may be, some <HI>Figure</HI>
and <HI>Station</HI> in the World; it cannot be
endured, that YOU should go on <HI>still
in your Trespasses.</HI> When <HI>Life</HI> &amp; <HI>Death</HI>
