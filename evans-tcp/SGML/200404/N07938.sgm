<P>AT a general Meeting of the Merchants and Traders of this City, it was this Day unanimously Resolved by them (and to strengthen their Resolution they entered into the most solemn Engagements with each other) that they would not Import any Goods from Great|Britain until the Stamp-Act was Repealed, do therefore hereby coun|termand all the Orders have heretofore transmitted to you for the shipping any Goods, and do expect and insist that you pay a strict and literal obedience to this injunction; for should they arrive and the Stamp-Act not be repealed, shall not dare to dispose of any Part of them, without a forfeiture of Honour; nor indeed can engage for their or own Safety.</P>
