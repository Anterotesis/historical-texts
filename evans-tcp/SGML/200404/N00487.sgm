it the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> little considering that the Apostacy came in by such means.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whereas they say, <HI>The Friends then present concluded of a Judg|ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matter, prevented of publishing the same by reason of</HI> George Keith <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Behaviour, and exticam Passion, which abruptly broke up the said Meeting.</HI> But this is another piece of their Hypoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, they should have said, if they would have said truly, what Judgment was given, ye were prevented of publishing of it by the unruly behaviour, and proud and insolent Carriage, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as unjust proceedings of <HI>Sam.Jenings</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tbar C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ok,</HI> who would not suffer the Judgment given to be published, after G.K. was ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d into the Meeting, until G.K. should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">yed for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his Brethren, which <HI>G.K.</HI> fervently and earnestly contradicted, crying out against their injustice, and Arbitrary Method, contrary to the way of worldly Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ts, in the like case, though some time alter <HI>S.J.</HI> was pleased to say, <HI>That Courts allowed of Discount;</HI> So that according to <HI>J.</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>W.S.</HI> shall be discounted for, and set off, against <HI>G.K's</HI> reviling his Brethren, if he had been guilty thereof, which they can never prove. And whether <HI>A. Cook</HI> was not guilty of extream Passion, who did in a Quarterly Meeting, whereof many can bear witness, pronounce a Curse against G.K. saying, <HI>George, thou best made this B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ec, and Wo be to thee from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Lord,</HI> and yet none of that Party reproved him for so doing?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Wherereas they give their Judgment, <HI>That</HI> W.S. <HI>is reprove|able and blame-worthy for uttering the said words (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> That G.K's preaching Christ within and Christ without, was preaching two Christs) <HI>they being an Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce in many sound and tender Friends, and that be condemn the same.</HI> It doth plainly appear, that their Judgment is but a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e shadow, or formality of Judgment, rather than any substantial, effectual, weighty and sollid Judgment against him, which if it had been, they would have aggravated it with other words and expression, and principally blamed him for his words of Unbelief and blasphemy against the son of Man, greatly offensive to God; but instead of that they say, <HI>They being Offensive to many sound and tender Friends:</HI> Why are they so severe to G.K. against whom they cannot justly charge any thing, either in Doctrine or Life, saying of him, <HI>He being a Man without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of God be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore his Eyes, &amp;c.</HI> Is it a greater Offence to them, that they are dishonoured, or that the worth Name of Christ is dishonoured, by an open de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">yal of him, as <HI>W. Stockdale</HI> did, by saying, <HI>To preach Faith in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> within and Faith in Christ without, is to preach Two Christs;</HI> for at
<PB N="23" REF="000612_0023_0FA9ADD8F3E49F48">
this rate, Christ without is to him but a false Christ; and this to them is so small a fault, that to deny Christ without us, they will not say in their Judgment, <HI>it is an Offence to God,</HI> but they say, <HI>It is Offence to many sound and tender Friends;</HI> Oh! great Hypocri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and want of Zeal to the Glory of God and Christ, though they are full of Zeal to their own Honour, that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> stink, and do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> this their great Partiality and Injustice, as well as their great ignorance, Error and Unbelief?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> But why do not the words of their Judgment run thus, <HI>That</HI> W.S. <HI>did say, to preach Faith in Christ without, and in Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, was to preach two Christs, &amp;c</HI> but that they are guilty themselves of not ha|ving this Faith; for not long ago, <HI>A Cook</HI> questioned G.K. at a Mens Meeting, which many can witness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of late, some of them say, they have a reverend esteem of Christ with|out, of his Death, Sufferings, Resurrection and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ention yet none of them preach it as a necessary matter of Salvation, to believe it, that ever we heard of, except <HI>John D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lavall,</HI> who hath of late changed his Faith, and got a say worse. And it cannot be supposed, that they hold Faith in Christ without them to be necessary to their Salvation seeing many of them that belong to the Monthly Meeting, have given their Judgment, <HI>That the Light is sufficient to Salvation without something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which is a plain excluding the Man Christ Jesus from having any part in our Salvation, and leaving him only the bare Name or Title of a Savi|our; and if so, then they had as good have wholly cleared <HI>W.S.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> It is great Confusion and Contradiction in these of that side, to condemn <HI>W. Stockdale,</HI> if they wore in good earnest, and to clear <HI>Tho. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> for if the Man Christ Jesus be our real Saviour, and that his Death, Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation for us without us in Heaven, hath any part in our Salvation, them the Light doth not save us without some-what else; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d therefore <HI>T.F.</HI> is guilty of Condemnation: But if <HI>T.F.</HI> be cleared, then the Man Christ without us is no real Saviour at all, and ought not to be preached, nor Faith in him, but only the Light within, and <HI>W.S.</HI> at this rate is in the right of it, and they have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to pass Judgment against him. I know no way to reconcile this, but to say, their Judgment against <HI>W.S.</HI> is a Mock-Judgment of show, without any Reality.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> They unjustly blame G.K. for not giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Gospel-Order, and take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> notice how W.S gave him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> at all, either of

<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That hey blame him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Will: Stockdale</HI> an <HI>Ignorant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he being,</HI> as they say, <HI>elder in the Truth, and in Tears.</HI> Then according to them, a man may be in the Truth, and a good Christian, and say, <HI>Christ without is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the true Christ.</HI>&mdash;but why is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> a bad Name? for if every honest <HI>Heathen</HI> be a true <HI>Chri|stian,</HI> as he is, according to that Principle held by their Monthly Mee|ting, <HI>That the Light is sufficient without the Man Christ, and without the Faith of his Death, Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation,</HI> which is that something else than honest <HI>Heathen</HI> is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Christian;</HI> and therefore by their own Principle, to be called a <HI>Heathen</HI> is no Reviling, and to be called <HI>Ignorant,</HI> is no Reviling, when a man is so; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> also, <HI>T.
