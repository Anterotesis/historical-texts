<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE repeated destruction of ancient records and papers by fire in the town of Boston first inclined me to endeavour the preser|vation of such materials as remained proper for an history of the Massachusets colony. Many such came to me from my ancestors, who for four suc|cessive generations had been principal actors in public affairs; among the rest a manuscript history of Mr. William Hubbard which is carried down to the year 1680 but after 1650 contains but few facts. The former part of it has been of great use to me. It was so to Dr. Mather in his history, of which Mr. Neale's is little more than an abridg|ment. I made what collection I could of the pri|vate papers of others of our first settlers, but in this I have not had the success I desired. The descen|dants of some of them are possessed of many valua|ble letters and other manuscripts, but have not lei|sure or inclination to look into them themselves and yet will not suffer it to be done by others. I am obliged to no person more than to my friend and brother the Reverend Mr. Mather, whose library has been open to me as it had been before to the Reverend Mr. Prince, who had taken from thence the greatest and most valuable part of what he had collected.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="009705_0004_0F7A455240E35738">SEVERAL gentlemen have given us encou|ragement to expect from them an history of the colony. Mr. Prince gave us the chronology of two or three years and there left it. Mr. Prat the late chief justice of New York, has often mentioned to me his intention to prepare and pub|lish such an history. Death has put it out of his power. Another gentleman of the first character at the bar, whose talents for it will not be called in question, has proposed the same thing. Want of leisure for it has probably prevented.</P>
<P>I AM sensible that whoever appears in print should be able to dispose his matter in such order, and cloath it with such stile and language as shall not only inform but delight the reader; therefore I would willingly have delivered over every thing I have collected to a person of genius for such a work. But seeing no prospect of it's being done by any other I engaged in it my self, being very loth that what had cost me some pains to bring together should be again scattered and utterly lost.</P>
<P>I AM sensible of many defects in this per|formance, and that it stands in need of all the apologies I am capable of making for it. It can|not be expected that the affairs of a colony should afford much matter interesting or entertaining to the world in general. I write for the sake of my own countrymen and even to many of them I expect some facts will be thought of too little im|portance, and yet I have omitted many such as have been judged proper for the press by former
<PB N="iii" REF="009705_0004_0F7A455240E35738">
historians. In general we are fond of knowing the minutiae which relate to our own ancestors. There are other facts which from the nature of them will afford but a dull and heavy narration. My chief design is to save them from oblivion.</P>
<P>ALL historians profess a sacred regard to truth. I have found some difficulty in guarding against e|very degree of prejudice in writing the history of my own country. I hope by shunning one extreme I have not run upon the other.</P>
<P>THE Massachusets colony may be considered as the parent of all the other colonies of New-England. There was no importation of planters from Eng|land to any part of the continent northward of Maryland, except to the Massachusets, for more than fifty years after the colony began. In the first ten years about twenty thousand souls had ar|rived in the Massachusetts. Since then it is sup|posed more have gone from hence to England than have come from thence hither. Massachusets-Bay, New-Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode-Island at this day probably contain five hundred thousand souls. A surprizing increase of subjects of the British crown!</P>
<P>BARBADOS and the leeward islands owed very much of their growth to the supplies of lumber, horses and provisions, with which they were fur|nished at the beginning of their settlements from this colony in as great plenty as they desired.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="009705_0005_0F7A4552F9DE9B10">THE addition of wealth and power to Great-Britain in consequence of this first emigration of our ancestors exceeds all expectation. They left their native country with the strongest assurances that they and their posterity should enjoy the privi|leges of free natural born English subjects. May the wealth and power of Britain still increase in proportion to the increase of her colonies; may those privileges never be abused; may they be preserved inviolate to the latest posterity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The History of the Colony of <HI>Massachusets-Bay</HI> from the first Settlement until the Year 1660.</HEAD>
<P>THE discovery of America by Columbus and of the northern continent by the Cabots in the 15th century, and the several voyages of English and French in the 16th I pass over, and begin with the voyage made by Bartholomew Gosnold, an Englishman, in the year 1602, to that part of North America since cal|led New-England. It is not certain that any European had been there before. Hackluit mentions the landing of some of Sir H. Gilbert's men upon some part of the conti|nent; but, its probable, that was farther eastward, upon what is now called Nova-Scotia. Gosnold landed first on the eastern coast, which he calls Mavoshen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 43 degrees North.</NOTE> After some commerce with the natives he sailed southward and landed upon one of the islands called Elizabeth islands.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A little Southward of Cape Cod. He gave the name also to Martha's Vineyard.</NOTE> He gave them that name in honour to Q. Elizabeth, who was living when he left England, and they have retained it ever since. He built a fort and intended a settlement upon the island, or the continent near it, but he could not persuade his peo|ple to remain there, and they all returned to England be|fore winter.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This I suppose is what Josselyn, and no other author, calls the first colony of New-Plimouth, for he says it was began in 1602&punc; and near Narraganset bay.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009705_0006_0F7A4553CC7B0D98">IN 1603, De Monts obtained a patent from Henry the 4th of France, for all the country from the 40th to the 46th degree, by the name of Cadie or Acadie. In 1604 De Monts ranged along the sea coast from St. Lawrence to Cape Cod, and to the south of it. He went far up Kene|beck river, and into divers other rivers, bays and harbours.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>He did not go into the Massachusets bay, but struck over from some part of the Eastern shore to Cape Ann, and so to Cape Cod, and sailed further southward.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Champ.</HI></BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>IN 1606 King James the first granted all the continent from 34 to 45 degrees, which he divided into two colo|nies, viz. the Southern or Virginia to certain merchants of London, the Northern or New-England to merchants of Plymouth.</P>
<P>IN 1607 some of the patentees of the Northern colony began a settlement at Sagadehoc. They laid the plan of a great state.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The following persons were sent over to begin the colony, George Popham, president, Rawleigh Gilbert, admiral, Edward Harlow, master of the ordnance, Robert Davies, serjeant-major, Ellis Best, marshal, &mdash; Seaman, secretary, James Davies, commander of the fort, Gome Carew, searcher, and about one hundred com|monalty.</NOTE> The president died the first winter, which was extreme cold. Sir John Popham his brother, the great promoter of the design, and Sir John Gilbert the admiral's brother, died the same year in Europe, and the next year, 1608, the whole number which survived the winter re|turned to England. Their design of a plantation was at an end. Both English and French continued their voyages to the coast, some for fishing, and some for trade with the natives; and some feeble attempts were made by the French towards plantations, but they were routed by the English in 1613. There was no spirit in the people of either nation for colonizing. Favorable accounts were published of the continent by Capt. Smith and others; but who would re|move and settle in so remote and uncultivated a part of the globe if he could live tolerably at home?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quis porro, praeter periculum horridi &amp; ignoti maris, Asi&acirc; aut Afric&agrave; aut Itali&acirc; relict&acirc;, Germaniam peteret informem terris, asperam caelo, tristem cultu aspectu&abque; nisi si patria sit. <BIBL>Tac. de mor. Germ.</BIBL></NOTE> The country
<PB N="3" REF="009705_0006_0F7A4553CC7B0D98">
would afford no immediate subsistance and therefore was not fit for indigent persons. Particular persons or compa|nies would have been discouraged from supporting a colony by the long continued expence and outset without any re|turn.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Capt. Mason spent twenty thousand pounds each, in attempts for settlement, and each of them thought it adviseable to give over their designs and sit down with the loss.</NOTE> No encouragement could be expected from the public. The advantages of commerce from the colonies were not then foreseen, but have been since learned by ex|perience. Virginia in it's infancy was struggling for life, and what it's fate would have been if the fathers of it in England had not seen the rise and growth of other colo|nies near it, is uncertain.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Whether Britain would have had any colonies in America at this day if religion had not been the grand inducement, is doubtful. One hundred and twenty years had passed from the discovery of the northern continent by the Cabots, without any success|ful attempt. After repeated attempts had failed it seems less probable that any should undertake in such an affair, than it would have been if no attempt had been made.</NOTE> God in his providence bringeth good out of evil. Bigotry and blind zeal prevailed among christians of every sect or profession. Each denied to the other what all had a right to enjoy, liberty of conscience. To this we must ascribe, if not the settlement, yet at least the present flourishing state of North America. Per|secution drove one Mr. Robinson and his church from Eng|land to Holland, about the year 1608. They stayed about a year at Amsterdam and then removed to Leyden. In 1617 they began to think of removing to America. They laid great stress upon their peculiar tenets, but this did not lessen their regard to morality. The manners of the Dutch were too licentious for them. Their children left them, some became soldiers and others sailors in the Dutch service. In a few years their posterity would have been Dutch, and their church extinct. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y were at a loss whether to remove to Guiana <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Walter Rawleigh had raised the same of Guiana about this time.</NOTE> or to Virginia, but the majority were in favour of the latter. The Dutch la|boured to persuade them to go to Hudson's river and
<PB N="4" REF="009705_0007_0F7A455473222620">
settle under their West-India company; but they had not lost their affection for the English, and chose to be under their government and protection. They applied to the Virginia company for a patent of part of the country. To render it probable that their undertaking would not, like all former, be abortive, they gave among others these special reasons:
<Q>That they were well weaned from the delicate milk of their mother country, and inured to the difficulties of a strange land. That they were knit toge|ther in a strict and sacred bond, by virtue of which they held themselves bound to take care of the good of each other and of the whole. That it was not with them as with other men whom small things could discourage, or small discontents cause to wish themselves at home again.</Q>
The Virginia company were very much pleased with the application, and some of the chief of them addressed the King to grant the petitioners liberty in religion under the great seal; but this was refused. He promised to connive, and not molest them; but this would not do for them at that time. They laid aside the design for that year. In 1619 they renewed their application and resolved to venture though they could not have a special grant from the King of liberty of conscience. They hoped their remote situation would put them out of danger of the ecclesiastical courts. The affairs of the Virginia company were in great confusion, and it was the latter end of the year before the patent was granted. It was taken out under the company's seal to John Wincob. He lived in the family of the Countess of Lincoln, and not removing with the rest, they never took any benefit from the patent. Mr. Weston and other merchants of London engaged, some to adventure their money, and some to go over with them. They therefore made the necessary preparations, and in July 1620 the principal of them went over to South|hampton, where two ships were ready to take them on board. They sailed the beginning of August, but were obliged repeatedly to put back and to leave one of their ships behind with part of the company at last. They in|tended
<PB N="5" REF="009705_0007_0F7A455473222620">
for Hudson's river or the coast near to it; but the Dutch had bribed their pilot, and he carried them farther northward, so that they fell in about Cape-Cod, and arri|ved in that harbour the 11th of November. The har|bour is good, but the country is sandy and barren. This was discouraging, but it was too late in the year to put to sea again. They coasted about in their boat until they found a place more agreeable to them for a plantation though not so good a harbour. Here they brought their ship and determined to take up their abode. They gave it the name of New-Plimouth. Captain Smith happened to give the name of Plimouth to the same place in 1614. A very circumstantial account of the beginning and pro|gress of this colony, wrote by Mr. Edward Winslow, one of the principal undertakers, is to be found among Purchase's collections.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1629 they obtained a patent from the Council of Plimouth.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE project of settling America revived again, and a new patent was granted bearing date Nov. 3d, 1620, in|corporating the adventurers to the northern colony by the name of the Council for the affairs of New-England; the bounds of the country were expressed between 40 and 48 deg. N. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason were two of the most active members of this council. All the sea-coast at one time or other has been granted or pretended to be granted by this council, and some parts seve|ral times over, partly from defects in form in preceding grants, and partly from unacquaintedness with the geography of the country. The first grant within the bounds of the Massachusets was obtained by Mr. Weston, who in the summer of 1622, sent over two ships with 50 or 60 men to begin a plantation at Wessagusset, since called Weymouth. They were sickly when they arrived, and received necessa|ries and refreshment from their neighbours at New-Plimouth. They were a dissolute crew, soon brought themselves to poverty, then robbed the Indians and offered other abuses to them. The Indians made their com|plaints to the colony of New-Plimouth; but the abuses
<PB N="6" REF="009705_0008_0F7A45564E911488">
continuing, the next year they laid a plot for the de|struction of all Weston's company.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It was this plantation which gave occasion to the author of Hu|dibras to make merry with New-England in general, for hanging a bed-rid weaver instead of a useful cobler. The Plimouth peo|ple, their neighbours, allowed that there was some foundation for the story. Several had been concerned in a theft. The Indians insisted that the ringleader should be put to death. They hanged one who was less culpable and not like to live, in his stead. Others say they deceived the Indians and hanged up one who died of sickness or famine a little while before.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Hubbard.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> The plot was dis|covered to the New-Plimouth people, who sent some of their men and prevented the execution of it, by the sur|prize of those who were to be the principal actors. Mr. Weston coming over to visit his plantation, was cast away in Ipswich bay, and stripped by the Indians of every thing but his shirt. Being thus rendered incapable of affording any relief to his colony, it came to an end after one year's continuance.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Robert Gorges obtained a patent from the council of Plimouth dated Dec. 13, 1622, 10 miles in breadth, and 30 miles into the land on the northeast side of Massachusets bay. This was loose and uncertain, and no use ever made of it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Robert Gorges conveyed his title to Sir William Brierton, who afterwards became an adventurer in the Massachusets corporation. He acquainted the company that he did not intend to contest with them, but desired a proportionable quantity of land might be assigned for the accommodation of his people and servants. They gave him a very respectful answer, but declined acknow|ledging his title by any capitulation. They promised him land sufficient for the encouragement of his design, but he must take it as one of the company, &amp;c. <HI>Mass. Records, Feb.</HI> 10. 1629. When the new charter in 1691 was preparing, one Mr. Levet, as heir at law to Sir William, laid in a claim to the lands con|tained in this grant, but it met with no countenance from the committee of Council.</P>
<BIBL><HI>M.S.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> He was son to Sir Ferdinando, and employed by the council in 1623 as lieutenant-general to restrain interlopers and regulate all affairs. He made some attempts to revive Weston's plantation, but returned home the same year without success. Francis West came the same year as Vice-Admiral, but made no stay. The
<PB N="7" REF="009705_0008_0F7A45564E911488">
Earl of Warwick had a patent for Massachusets bay about the same time, but the bounds are not known.</P>
<P>IN 1624, Lyford the minister of New-Plimouth and one John Oldham stirred up a faction there, and were banished that colony. They began a settlement at Nan|tasket. The same year some persons belonging to Dor|chester in England sent over fishermen and made necessary provision for a fishery at Cape-Ann, and Roger Conant,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">He lived until about 1680, and died at Beverly in the county of Essex. He is always spoken of as a person of worth. The supe|rior condition of the persons who came over with the charter, cast a shade upon him, and he lived in obscurity. There are several of his descendants remaining. Some of distinction in the colony of Connecticut. Governor's island in Boston harbour, was called Conant's island.</NOTE> who with John Oldham had left Plimouth and removed with the rest to Nantasket, was appointed their overseer, A grant was made by one of the Gorges, it is not said which, to Oldham and others, of part of Massachusetts bay, which occasioned some dispute between them and the Massachusets grantees.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the end of the first book of records of deeds for the county of Suffolk, is the copy of a letter from the company in England to Capt. John Endicott, dated Gravesend, 27th April, 1629, in the close of which is thus written.</P>

<P>IN 1625 one Capt. Wollaston with about 30 persons began a plantation near Weston's. They gave it the name of Mount Wollaston. It was known by that name some

One Morton of Furnival's inn was of this company. He was not left in command, but contrived to make himself chief, changed the name of Mount Wollaston to Merry Mount, set all the servants free&punc; erected a may-pole, and lived a life of dissipation until all the stock intended for trade was consumed. He was charged with furnishing the Indians with guns and ammunition, and teaching them the use of them. At length he made himself so obnoxious to the planters in all parts, that at their general desire the people of New-Plimouth seized him by an armed force, and confined him until they had an opportunity of sending him to England. In the fall of 1626 Roger Conant and some if not all of his company removed from Cape-Ann to a neck of land upon Naumkeak river. I find mention made of planters at Winisimet about the same time, who probably removed there from some of the other plantations. This is all the account we have of any settlements or attempts for settlements in the Massachusets bay until the year 1627. Mr. White the minister of Dorchester had encouraged Conant and his company to remain in New-England, and promised them men, provisions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN 1627, March 19, the Council of Plimouth sold to Sir Henry Roswell, Sir John Young, Thomas Southcoat, John Humphry, John Endicot, and Simon Whetcomb, who lived about Dorchester in England, their heirs and asso|ciates, all that part of New-England three miles to the south of Charles river, and three miles north of Merri|mack river, from the Atlantick to the South Sea. All the lesser grants which have been mentioned within those limits (the settlement of the country being entirely neg|lected by the grantees) were without doubt looked upon to be forfeited or void.

Wednesday in Easter term, on the 13th of May 1628 Mr. Cradock was chosen governor by the company, and Mr. Goffe deputy governor, and Sir Richard Saltonstall, Isaac Johnson, Samuel Aldersey, John Venn, John Humfrey, Simon Whetcomb, Increase Nowell, Richard Perry, Natha|nael Wright, Samuel Vassall, Theophilus Eaton, Thomas Adams, Thomas Hutchins, George Foxcroft, William Vas|sall, William Pincheon, John Pocock, and Christopher Coul|son, assistants. William Burgis was chosen secretary in the room of John Washburne. At this court it was determined that every one of the company who had subscribed fifty pounds should have 200 acres of land assigned, and in pro|portion for a greater or lesser sum as the first dividend. The names of all the adventurers and the sums subscrib|ed were sent over to Mr. Endicot, who was appointed their governor in the plantation. A second embarkation of planters and servants had been determined at a meeting April 30, to be made with all speed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Endicot sent three brethren, Ralph, Richard and William Sprague, to explore the country westward. Between Mistick and Charles rivers they find a body of Indians settled, called Abergi|nians, and one English house thatched and possessed by Thomas Walford, a smith.

He went soon after his arrival to Charlestown, and tarried about a year in the country. Mr. Smith seems to have been of the separation in England, which occasioned the caution used with him. He was a little while at Nantasket, and went from thence to Plimouth, where he was their minister several years.</NOTE> Five ships were provided for

this embarkation. Mr. Higginson says in his journal that he sailed from the Isle of Wight the 11th of May, and arrived at Cape-Ann the 27th of June, and at Naumkeag the 29th. They found at Naumkeag about 100 planters, 8 houses, besides a fair house built for Mr. Endicot. The old and new planters together were about 300, of which 100 removed to Charlestown, where there was a house built, the rest remained at Salem. Mr. Endicot had cor|responded with the settlers at Plimouth, who satisfied him that they were right in their judgments of the outward form of worship, being much like to that of the reformed churches in France, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hubbard in his M.S. history remarks upon this occasion.
<Q>It is certainly known that the old non-conformists and good old puritans of Queen Elizabeth's and King James's time, did in ma|ny things not symbolize with the separatists, the one endeavour|ing only a reformation of some corruptions retained or crept into the church (as they thought) either before or after its reformed state; the other not content therewith stood as stiffly to maintain a necessity of disannulling their former church state, as that like a vessel once infected with leprosy&punc; it must be broken in pieces to be new cast.&mdash;It is affirmed that Mr. Hildersham advised Mr. Higginson and other ministers looking this way, to agree up|on their form of church government before they came away from England, which counsel if it had been attended might have prevented some inconvenience that hath since fallen out, or at least have saved some of the succeeding ministers from the impu|tation of departing from their first principles&punc; because they were not publickly declared in the beginning of things.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>M.S.

Nothing is said of any church being then formed; but on the 6th of August, the day appointed for the choice and ordination of elders and deacons, thirty persons entered into a covenant in writing, which is said to be the beginning of the church, and that the ministers were ordained or instituted anew. The repetition of this form they probably thought necessary, because the people were not in a church state before.
<PB N="12" REF="009705_0011_0F7A4559D8782CE8">
It is difficult to assign any other reason. Messengers or delegates from the church of Plimouth were expected to join with them, but contrary winds hindered them in their passage, so that they did not arrive until the afternoon, but time enough to give the right hand of fellowship. Two of the company, John Brown and Samuel Brown, one a lawyer, the other a merchant, both men of good estates, and of the first patentees and of the council, were dissatisfied. They did not like that the common prayer and service of the church of England should be wholly laid aside, and therefore drew off, with as many as were of their sen|timents, from the rest and set up a separate society. This offended the governor, who caused the two members of his council to be brought before him, and judging that this practice, together with some speeches they had uttered, tended to sedition, he sent them back to England. The heads of the party being removed the opposition ceased.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>They applied to the company, upon their arrival in England, for recompence for the damages they had sustained, and the matter was referred to Samuel Vassall, William Vassall, Simon Whet|comb and William Pynchon, chosen by the complainants, and John White, John Davenport, Isaac Johnson, and John Win|throp, chosen by the company.

<P>WHILST these things were doing in the colony, the company in England were projecting a much larger em|barkation, and the transfer of the corporation itself from Old England to New. Several gentlemen of figure and estate, Isaac Johnson, John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, and divers others, who were dissatisfied with the arbitrary proceedings both in church and state, pleased themselves with the prospect of liberty in both, to be enjoyed in America, and proposed to the company at London to re|move with their families&punc; but upon this condition only,
<PB N="13" REF="009705_0011_0F7A4559D8782CE8">
that the patent and charter should remove with them. This proposal was first communicated July the 28th, 1629. A committee was appointed to consider of it and to advise with counsel learned in the law and to make report. The adventurers had been at great expence without any returns made to them, and had no rational prospect of any profit from the plantation in the way they were in. The principal objection seems to have arose from a doubt whether such a transfer was legal. The report of the committee is not recorded. Mr. White a counsellor at law was one of the company and great stress was laid upon his opinion; and on the 29th of August it was de|termined
<Q>by the general consent of the company that the government and patent should be settled in New-England.</Q>
It is evident from the charter that the original design of it was to constitute a corporation in England, like to that of the East-India and other great com|panies, with powers to settle plantations within the limits of the territory, under such forms of government and magistracy as should be fit and necessary. The first step in sending out Mr. Endicot, appointing him a council, giving him commission, instructions, &amp;c. was agreeable to this construction of the charter.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this new resolution, the members of the corporation which remained in England were to retain a share in the trading stock and the profits of it for the term of seven years. The management of it was committed to five persons who were going over, viz. J. Winthrop, Sir Richard Saltonstall, I. Johnson, T. Dudley, and J. Revell, and to five who were to remain, M. Cradock, N. Wright, T. Eaton, T. Goffe, and J. Young, and at the expiration of the term the stock with the profits were to be divided to each man in proportion to his adventure. All other powers and privileges were to remain with the planters upon the spot. We have no account of any divi|dend ever made, nor indeed of any trade ever carried on for the company. There was another article, that one

half the charge of fortifications and support of the ministers should be paid out of the joint stock, but no notice was taken of it in the colony.</P>
<P>THE 20th of October at a general court of governor, deputy and assistants, and the generality, a new choice was made of governor, &amp;c. consisting of such persons as had determined to go over with the patent. John Winthrop was elected governor, John Humfrey deputy governor, Sir Richard Saltonstall, Isaac Johnson, Thomas Dudley, John Endicot, Increase Nowell, William Vassall, William Pyn|chon, Samuel Sharp, Edward Rossiter, Thomas Sharp, John Revell, Matthew Cradock, Thomas Goffe, Samuel Aldersey, John Venn, Nathaniel Wright, Theophilus Eaton, and Thomas Adams, assistants.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>I have endeavoured to obtain as particular account as can be now had of the character and circumstances of the principal undertakers.</P>
<P>Mr. Winthrop, the governor was of Groton in Suffolk, descended from reputable ancestors. One of them, Adam Winthrop, is said to have been an eminent lawyer, and also a great favourer of the gospel in the reign of Henry the eighth. Mr. Winthrop was a justice of peace at the age of eighteen, and very early in life was exemplary for his polite as well as grave and christian deportment. He had an estate of six or seven hundred pounds a year, which he turned into money, and embarked his all to promote the settle|ment of New-England. It is a very full evidence of the esteem he was in, that when many gentlemen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> character, som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them of noble alliance, were concerned in the same undertaking with him, he by a general voice was placed at their head. He was eleven times chosen governor, and spent his whole estate in the publick service, the stipend being small and his hospitality great, and his bayliff unfaithful. His son and grandson were successively governors of Connecticut colony. His great grandson John Win|throp, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> died in London about 12 or 14 years ago. He was known there by the name of Governor Winthrop, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and one volume of the Philosophical Transactions is dedicated to him. And his posterity have been ever since re|spected and honoured both in Connecticut and in the Massachu|sets. Mr. Winthrop was about forty-three years of age when he removed.</P>
<P>Mr. Dudley's father, Capt. Roger Dudley, lost his life in the service of his country, leaving no other son. Mr. Dudley early in life engaged in the same service. In 1597 he raised a company of volunteers, received a captaincy from Queen Elizabeth, went over to France, and was at the siege of Amiens under Henry the fourth. After his return to Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd he married a gentlewoman of good family and estate, and settled near Northampton, in the neighbour|hood of Mr. Dod, Hilders<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am, and other celebrated puritan mini|sters, was a devout attendant upon their ministry, and (although he had been an officer) became a sober non-conformist. Lord Say and Seal recommended him to the Earl of Northampton. The Earl when he came to his estate found it encumbered and entangled: but putting his affairs under the care of Mr. Dudley, he by his prudent management very happily extricated them. After which, leaving the service of the Earl he removed to Boston, where he became acquainted with Mr. Cotton. He was soon desired to return to the Earl's family, where he continued until he came to New-England. He was far advanced in life for such an under|taking, being fifty-four years of age. He was chosen into the magistracy every year of his life afterwards, four years governor, and often deputy governor. He married a second time in his old age, and had a new set of children; and it is very remarkable, tha t he was a captain in 1597, and in 1764 two of his grand children are living, viz. one elderly lady at New-London, in Con|necticut colony, the widow of John Winthrop, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> great grand|son of the first governor, and another at Newbury in the Massa|chusets, Mrs. Atkins.</P>
<P>Mr. Humfrey was early engaged. He was one of the six original patentees from the council of Plimouth. He was prevented from coming over with the charter. He married the Lady Susan, daughter to the Earl of Lincoln, and brought her with their children to New-England in 1632, and was immediately chosen an assistant. He settled at Saugus, now Lynn, about 12 miles from Boston. Ebenezer Burrill, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late of the council, lived on part of his farm. Upon an invitation from Lord Say, he intended in the year 1640 to have removed to the Bahama islands; but the island of Providence being taken by the Spaniards, he gave over that design. Soon after, having met with great losses by fire, and his estate being much impaired, he sold his plantation at Saugus to Lady Moody and returned to England.</P>
<P>Sir Richard Saltonstall was the first name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> associate to the six original patentees. Although he remained but a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort time in New-England, yet his heart was set upon promoting the colony. He sent over two of his sons, one of which was chosen into the ma|gistracy and continued in it, except while he was absent in Eng|land, until after the year 1680. Sir Richard was son or grand|son of Sir Richard Saltonstall, Lord Mayor of London in 1597. He lived many years after his return to England. I have seen his name among the commissioners for the trial of Lilburn, or some other offender against the state. By a will made in 1658, he gave a legacy to the college in New-England. His great grand|son, Gurdon Saltonstall, was many years governor of Connecticut, and some of his posterity in that colony and the Massachusets are in esteem and honour to this day. Sir John Foche, a city knight in King William's reign, married his great grand daughter.</P>
<P>Mr. Johnson, in a will uncancelled and which remains on the Massa|chusets files, executed April 28, in the 5th of King Charles the first, calls himself of Clipsham in the county of Rutland, son of Abraham Johnson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and grandson of Robert Johnson. Doctor Chaderton was his mother's father. He had much the largest estate of any of the undertakers. It lay in Rutland, Northampton|shire and Lincolnshire. He values his interest, at that time, in the New-England adventure at six hundred pounds. He had no children. After providing for his lady he gave a great number of legacies to his friends, and to pious and charitable uses; his lands he gave to his father and brethren. To Mr. Cotton, from whom, to the praise of God's grace, he acknowledges to have received much help and comfort in his spiritual estate, he gave thirty pounds and a gown cloth. The advowson and right of patronage of the parish church of Clipsham, he gave to Mr. Dud|ley and Mr. Cotton. He limited his funeral charges to &pound;. 250. As providence ordered it, a small part of that sum sufficed. His heart was set on the New-England concern, and he ordered his executors to carry on his share or part in it. He made another will before his death, and appointed John Hampden, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of his executors with Winthrop and Dudley. Upon his death bed he is said to have rejoiced that he had lived to see a church of Christ gathered in America, and professed that he thought his life better spent than in any other way. He was buried, at his own request, in part of the ground upon Trimontain or Boston, which he had chosen for his lot, the square between School-street and Queen-street. He may be said to have been the idol of the people, for they ordered their bodies as they died to be buried round him, and this was the reason of approp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iating for a place of burial what is now called the old bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing-place, adjoining to King's chapel. He married the Lady Arabella, another daughter of the Earl of Lincoln.</P>
<P>Mr. Endicot, the next named, was among the most zealous under|takers and the most rigid in principles, as will appear in the course of the history. This disposition distinguished him more than his other mental accomplishments or his outward condition in life. I have seen a letter from the Secretary of State in King Charles the second's time, wherein is this expression,
<Q>The King would take it well if the people would leave out Mr. Endicot from the place of governor.</Q>
Some of his posterity remain at or near Salem.</P>
<P>Mr. Nowell was nephew to Alexander Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's in Queen Elizabeth's reign, or else the Dean was his great uncle. He was a ruling elder, some time, of the church at Charlestown; but that place and a place in the civil order were thought in that day not well to consist, and therefore he quitted it, chusing the places of assistant and secretary.</P>
<P>Mr. William Vassall, as well as his brother Samuel Vassall, were gentlemen of good circumstances in England, but do not seem to have been fully of the same sentiment in matters of religion with the planters in general; and altho' William came over with the first company, yet he soon went back to England. He returned a few years after to New-England, and settled at Scituate in Pli|mouth colony, not because they were reputed more rigid than the Massachusets people. When Jamaica was taken by Cromwell he laid the foundation of several fine estates there, enjoyed by his posterity to the present time.</P>
<P>Mr. Pynchon was a gentleman of learning as well as religion. He laid the foundation of Roxbury, but soon removed to Connecticut river, was the father of the town of Springfield, where his family hath flourished ever since.</P>
<P>Edward Rossiter was of a good family in the West of England. He died the first year. His son lived afterwards at Combe. His grandson Edward Rossiter in the year 1682 was deacon of Mr. Joseph Alleine's church in Taunton. He says in a letter, dated March. 28. 1682, that his grand father a pious gentleman of good estate left England for the sake of religion.</P>
<P>Thomas Sharp and John Revell made but a short stay in New-England.</P>
<P>Mr. Eaton was an East country merchant. His father was a mini|ster in Coventry. He did not come to New-England until 1637. And then settled New-Haven colony of which he was governor all his life after, His correspondence both with the governor of the Massachusets and with the Dutch governor of Manhadoes, or New-York, discover a good understanding and virtuous mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Coddington was of Lincolnshire, zealous to a great degree, was afterwads the father of Rhode Island colony where his zeal abated and he promoted a general toleration. He was many years their governor and would gladly have joined in confederacy with the other colonies&punc; but different sentiments upon religion prevented.</P>
<P>Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of Emanuel College Cambridge, from whence he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the family of the Earl of Lincoln as his steward, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">wards he lived in the same capacity with the Countess of Warwick. He married one of Mr. Dudley's daughters, and after her death a sister of Sir George Downing. He lived to be the Nestor of New-England, was born the beginning of the century in 1603 and wanted but three or four years of compleating it. I suppose Sir Simon Bradstreet and Dudley Bradstreet of the king|dom of Ireland are descended from him.</P>
<P>Mr. Venn commonly called Colonel Venn was in the design from the beginning, and intended to have removed, but never did. Upon the change of affairs in England he made a figure there, being one of the members for the city in the long parliament, and among the most active in the opposition to the court, and was one of the King's judges.</P>
<P>Mr. Cradock was more forward in advancing out of his substance than any other, being generally the highest in all subscriptions. He was an eminent merchant in London and continued divers years to carry on a trade in the colony by his servants, but he ne|ver came over. His son or grandson Samuel Cradock was a dis|senting minister at Wickambrook in 1690. George Cradock, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> now in public posts in the colony is descended from him.</P>
<P>I can give no account of the other assistants.</P>
<P>Sir William Brereton was one of the company and seems to have been preparing to come over, but he found employment also in the long parliament and in the army, was at the head of the forces which reduced Chester. Several others as Mr. Blackhouse, Mr. Whichcote, Captain Waller, Mr. Pocock, Mr. Harwood, and other persons of note were of the company and great promoters of the plantation. Lincolnshire contributed greatly, and more of our principal families derive their origin from thence than from any part of England, unless the city of London be an exception. The Countess of Warwick was a benefactor. In 1634 the general court voted
<Q>that there should be letters of thankfulness signed by the court and sent to the Countess of Warwick, Mr. Paynter, Mr. Wood, and others that have been benefactors to this planta|tion.</Q>
The Earl of Warwick her son was a patron of the colony and was very able as well as willing to do kind offices to it as long as he lived. Some of the ministers were of families of distinction. Mr. Bulkley from Bedfordshire of an honorable family there. Samuel Whiting who was minister of Lynn married a daughter of Oliver St. John. She came with him to New-England. John Shearman minister of Watertown married a grand daughter of Earl Rivers. Her father Mr. Laume was a gentleman of 1400 l. a year. She was alive in 1697, the mother of 20 children.</P></NOTE> They did not all go over.

fortitude in a man in health and vigour, who goes through the fatigues of a long voyage and spends but a few months in a wilderness, among Savages, and in a climate more severe than he had ever experienced. What must we think then of persons of rank and good circumstances in life bidding a final adieu to all the conveniencies and delights of England their native country, and exposing themselves their wives and children to inevitable hardships and sufferings, in a long voyage across the Atlantick, to land upon a most inhospitable shore, destitute of any kind of building to secure them from the inclemency of the weather, and of most sorts of food to which they had been always used at their former home? The sickness and mortality which prevailed the first winter, they did not foresee. It is an observation since made, that most parts of America have proved unhealthy (except where the country is cleared) until persons have had a seasoning in it.</P>

The Arabella, on board which was the governor and several of the assistants left Yarmouth between the 7th and 10th of April. On the 7th the governor and divers others on board signed a pa|per directed to their brethren of the church of England, to remove suspicions or misconstructions, and to ask their prayers.

<P>THE governor and some of the principal persons left Salem the 17th of June and travelled through the woods to Charlestown, about 20 miles, to look out for a conve|nient place for their chief town, which they had deter|mined should be in some part of the bay or harbour between Nantasket and Cambridge. At first they pitched upon the north side of Charles river, or rather northwest, by the major voice, but a number of the principal gentle|men having fixed their cottages (shelters intended for one winter only) upon the opposite side of the river, the go|vernor and most of the assistants removed to them in November. They were however undetermined where to build in the spring. A fortified town, at least palisa|doed, was thought necessary to defend them against the natives, and they could not agree upon the most conve|nient place for that purpose.</P>
<P>THEY found, when they arrived, a few families scatter|ed about in several parts of the bay. Mr. Maverick, who will often appear in the course of this history, lived upon Noddle's island, a grant or confirmation of which he after|wards obtained from the court.

On the north of Charles river (Charlestown) were the remains of those who had moved the last year from Salem; here Mr. Nowell and some of his friends made their pitch, but considered them|selves and Boston at first as but one settlement and one church, with Mr. Wilson for their minister. When he went to England in the spring, Charlestown became a distinct church and town and took Mr. James for their minister. Sir Richard Saltonstall chose a place some miles up Charles river, which has taken the name of Watertown. His company took Mr. Phillips for their minister. Mr. Pyn|chon was at the head of another company who settled be|tween Dorchester and Boston. Their town took the name of Roxbury. They had Mr. Eliot<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">He did not come over until 1631. Mr. Weld was his colleague.</NOTE> for their minister.

They had little time enough to provide their huts. Assoon as December came their out-door work was over. On the 6th of De|cember the governor and assistants met and agreed to fortify the neck between Boston and Roxbury, and orders were given for preparing the materials, but at another meeting on the 21st they laid that design aside and agreed

on a place <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">First called Newtown, since Cambridge.</NOTE> about three miles above Charlestown, and most of them engaged to build houses there the next year. The weather held tolerable until the 24th of December, but the cold then came on with violence. Such a Christ|mas eve they had never seen before. From that time to the 10th of February their chief care was to keep themselves warm, and as comfortable in other respects as their scant provision would permit. The poorer sort were much exposed, lying in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents and miserable hovels, and many died of the scurvy and other distempers. They were so short of provisions that many were obliged to live upon clams, mussels and other shell-fish, with ground-nuts and acorns instead of bread. One that came to the gover|nor's house to complain of his sufferings was prevented, being informed that even there the last batch was in the oven. Some instances are mentioned of great calmness and resig|nation in this distress. A good man who had asked his neighbour to a dish of clams, after dinner returned thanks to God who had given them to suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasure hid in the sands. They had appointed the 22d of February for a fast, but on the 5th to their great joy the ship Lyon, Capt. Pierce, one of the last years fleet returned laden with provisions from England, which were distributed according to the necessities of the people. They turned their fast into a thanksgiving.</P>
<P>IN the spring of 1631 they pursued their design of a fortified town at Newtown. The governor set up the frame of a house, the deputy governor finished his house and removed his family. About this time Chicketawbut the chief of the Indians near Boston came to visit the governor and made high professions of friendship. The apprehensions of danger lessened by degrees, the design of a fortified town went off in the same proportion, until it was wholly laid aside. The governor took down his frame and carried it to Boston. Mr. Dudley the deputy was of|fended, and persisted for some time in his first determination of residing at Newtown, but at length removed to Roxbury.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009705_0017_0F7A455E390B0ED0">THIS scheme of a fortified town was well enough while they were uncertain what the temper of the natives would be.

They went in the Lyon which brought their supply. In the same ship Sir Christopher Gardner was sent home under confinement.

He offered to join to several of the churches, but
<PB N="25" REF="009705_0017_0F7A455E390B0ED0">
he was suspected to be an immoral man and not received. He had a comely young woman which travelled with him. He called her his cousin. For some miscarriages in the Massachusets he fled to the Indians. They carried him to Plimouth, having first used him pretty roughly. From thence he was sent to Boston. He joined afterwards with Gorges, Mason and others in complaints against the colony.</P>
<P>MR. Wilson left the church on the south side of the river without a minister. At his parting he recommended them to the care of the governor, deputy-governor and other godly and able christians to carry on the worship of God on the Lord's day by prophesying until his return.</P>
<P>So much of their attention was necessary in order to provide for their support that little business was done by the assistants or by the general court. The removal of the charter made many new regulations necessary which were settled by degrees. The first court of assistants was at Charlestown Aug. 23d about two months after their ar|rival. A beadle a corporation officer was appointed. It was then ordered that the governor and deputy for the time being should be justices of the peace, four of the then assistants were also appointed justices. All justices whatso|ever were to have the same power for reformation of a|buses and punishing offenders which justices have in Eng|land, but no corporal punishment to be inflicted except by an assistant. In high offences the governor and assistants sat as a court as well as in civil matters. There was a trial by a jury this year for murder and the person charged was acquitted. The first general court was held the 19th of October, not by a representative but by every one that was free of the corporation in person. None had been admit|ted freemen since they left England. The governor and assistants had a great influence over the court. It was or|dered that for the future the freemen should chuse the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the assistants from among themselves chuse the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rnor and deputy governor. The court of assis|tants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> have the power of making laws and appoint|ing officers. This was a departure from their charter.
<PB N="26" REF="009705_0018_0F7A455EF1994400">
One hundred and nine freemen were admitted at this court. Maverick, Blackstone, and many more who were not of any of the churches were of this number. This was all that was transacted that was any thing material the first year. The next general court was the court of election for 1631. The scale was now turned and the freemen resolved to chuse both governor, deputy and assistants notwithstanding the former vote, and made an order that for the time to come none should be admitted to the freedom of the body politick but such as were church members.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>None may now be a freeman of that company unless he be a church member among them.

<PB N="28" REF="009705_0019_0F7A4560DE067660">
However, the Sagamores near Boston made professions of friendship, and on the 5th of August this year Mianti|nomo one of the great Sachems of the Naragansets, the most numerous of all the Indians between Boston and Hudson's river, came down to Boston, whether out of fear or love they could not tell, to enter into a league of friendship with the colony. He and his followers were invited to attend the publick worship, but three of them withdrew in sermon time, and to satisfy their hunger broke into an English house to get victuals. The Sagamore who was a very high spirited fellow could hardly be persuaded to order them any corporal punishment, but he was so ashamed of his attendants that he ordered them out of town and followed them himself soon after.</P>
<P>THE French also occasioned some uneasy apprehensions. They had been drove from Accady by Sir Samuel Argall in 1613. The people of New-Plimouth had set up a trading house at Penobscot about the year 1627. Intelli|gence was brought this year to the Massachusets that in 1630 or 1631 Sir William Alexander had sold the country of Nova-Scotia to the French, and that the fort with all the ammunition and stores were delivered to them; that Cardinal Richlieu had ordered some companies there, and that more were expected the next year with priests, jesuits, &amp;c. This news alarmed the governor and council and put them upon consultations for their defence. They determined to finish a fort which was begun at Boston, to build another at Nantasket, and to hasten the settlement of Agawam (Ipswich) it being one of the best places both for pasture and tillage, lest an enemy should take possession and prevent them. Mr. Winthrop the governor's son was accordingly sent to begin a plantation there.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tarrateen or Eastern Indians who had a spight against the Indians of Agawam, and had attacked them and drove them from their settlement, intended mischief against the English also, as appears by the following account preserved among the papers of Mr. Cobbett the minister of Agawam or Ipswich:
<Q>At the first planting of Ipswich, as a credible man informed me, namely Quartermaster Perkins, the Tarrateens or Easterly In|dians had a design to have cut them off at the first, when they had but between 20 and 30 men old and young belonging to the place, and at that instant most of them gone into the bay about their occasions not hearing of any intimations thereof. It was thus. One Robin a friendly Indian came to this John Perkins then a young man, living then in a little hut upon his father's island on this side of Jeoffry's neck and told him, on such a Thursday morning early there would come four Indians to draw him to go down the hill to the water side to truck with them, which if he did he and all near him would be cut off, for there were 40 birchin canoes would lie out of sight at the brow of the hill full of arm'd Indians for that purpose. Of this he forthwith acquainted Mr. John Winthrop, who then lived there in a house near the water, who advised him, if such Indians came, to carry it ruggedly towards them and threaten to shoot them if they would not be gone, and when their backs were turned to strike up a drum he had with him besides his two muskets and then discharge them that so 6 or 8 young men who were in the marshes hard by a mowing, keeping their guns ready charged by them might take the alarm, and the Indians would perceive their plot was discovered and haste away to sea again, which accordingly was so acted and took like effect, for he told me he presently after discerned 40 such canoes shove off from under the hill and make as fast as they could to sea.</Q></NOTE> It appears
<PB N="29" REF="009705_0019_0F7A4560DE067660">
that their apprehensions of the French designs to take pos|session of some part or other of the coast were not ill founded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1632.</NOTE> for they sent a ship this year to Penobscot as a prelude to what was to come after. Governor Bradford of Plimouth gives this account of it.
<Q>This year the house at Penobscot is robbed by the French in this manner. While the master of the house and part of the company with him is come with one vessel to the westward to fetch a supply of goods brought over for us, a small French vessel having a false Scot aboard goes into the harbour, pretends they are newly come from sea, knows not where they are, that the vessel is very leaky, and desires they may hawl her a|shore and stop her leaks, making many French comple|ments and congees: And seeing but three or four simple men who are servants, and by the Scotchman understanding the master and the rest of the company
<PB N="30" REF="009705_0020_0F7A45615F92B3E0">
are gone from home, fall to commending the guns and muskets which lie on the racks by the wall side, take them down to look on them, asking if they were charged, and when possessed of them, one presents a loaded piece against the servants, another a pistol, they bid them not to stir but deliver the goods, and made them help in carrying them all aboard to the value of four or five hundred pounds sterling, prime cost; three hundred weight of beaver, the rest in trading goods, as coats, rugs, blankets, &amp;c. then set the servants at liberty and go away with this taunting message, Tell your master when he returns that some of the Isle of Rhee gentle|men have been here.</Q></P>
<P>IT appears that the Massachusets people took possession of the country at a very critical time. Rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ieu in all probability would have planted his colony nearer the sun if he could have found any place vacant. De Monts and company had acquired a thorough knowledge of all the coast from Cape Sables beyond Cape Cod in 1604, indeed it does not appear that they then went round or to the bottom of Massachusets bay. Had they once gained foot|ing there they would have prevented the English. The frenchified court of King Charles the first would, at the treaty of Saint Germains, have given up any claim to Mas|sachusets bay as readily as they did to Acadie; for the French could make out no better title to Penobscot and the other parts of Acadie than they could to Massachusets. The little plantation at New-Plimouth would have been no greater bar to the French in one place than in the other. The Dutch the next year would have quietly possessed themselves of Connecticut river, unless the French instead of the English had pre|vented them. Whether the people of either nation would have persevered is uncertain. If they had done it the late contest for the dominion of North-America would have been between France and Holland, and the commerce of England would have borne a very different proportion to that of the rest of Europe from what it does at present.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="009705_0020_0F7A45615F92B3E0">THE new settlers were in perils also from their own countrymen. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Capt.

They intended for themselves all that part of the colony which lies to the Eastward of Naumkeag.

And whereas it was informed in particular, that there are at this present divers ships in the river of Thames ready to set sail thither freighted with passengers and provisions, It is thought fit and ordered that stay should be forthwith made of the said ships until further order from this board. And the several masters and freighters of the same should attend the board on wednesday next in the afternoon with a list of the passengers and provisions in each ship. And that Mr. Cradock a chief adventurer in that plan|tation now present before the board should be required to cause the letters patent for the said plantation to be brought to this board.</Q>

<P>MR. Hubbard says that this order was the effect of a new complaint preferred by Gardiner, Morton and others, of their hardships and sufferings from the severity of the government, and that such of the company as were in England were called before the committee of council, and delivered an answer in writing, and that upon reading thereof it pleased God so to work with the Lords of the council and afterwards with the King's Majesty, that when the whole matter was reported to him by Sir Thomas Jermayne one of the council who had been present at the three days of hearing, and spake much in commendation of the governor, both to the Lords and after to his Ma|jesty, the King said he would have such severely punished as should abuse his governor and the plantation, and the defendants were dismissed with a favorable order for their encouragement; being assured from some of the council that his Majesty did not intend to impose the ceremonies of the church of England upon them, for that it was considered it was for the sake of freedom from those

The church of Boston by advice of the go|vernor and council and of the elders in the colony received him for their teacher, to which office he was ordained the 17th October. Mr. Thomas Leverett an ancient member of Mr. Cotton's church in England was at the same time ordained ruling elder. The circumstances and order of proceeding in Mr. Cotton's ordination were intended as a precedent, and the congregational churches in New Eng|land have generally conformed thereto ever since. Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone with their friends settled at New|town (Cambridge.)<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the year 1633 the small pox made terrible havock among the Indians of Massachusets. Whether or no their food and irregu|lar diet furnishes greater quantities of the morbifick matter than in more temperate persons I leave to physicians. They were de|stitute of every thing proper for comfort and relief and died in greater proportion than is known among the English. John Sagamore of Winesimet and James of Lynn with almost all their people died of the distemper. All writers agree that, a few year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before the English came to New-Plimouth, a mortal contagious di|stemper swept away great numbers of Indians, so that some tribes were in a manner extinct, the Massachusets particularly are said by some to have been reduced from thirty thousand to three hundred fighting men. The small pox proving since so fatal to Indians caused some to suppose that to have been the distemper, but the Indians themselves always gave a very different account, and by their description it was a pestilential putrid fever. In one of the voyages collected by Purchase it is said to have been the plague, and that some of the Indians which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> shewed the scars of the boil. An instance of mortality among the Indians of Nan|tucket in the year 1763 strengthens the probability of their ac|count of the distemper itself and of the amazing effects of it.</P>
<P>In the beginning of October there were belonging to the island of Nantucket about 320 Indians of every age and sex in 90 families. A fever then began among them, and before the end of January between 260 and 270 persons had been seized with it, of which number 6 men and 9 women only recovered, and but 15 families and about 85 souls remained, 15 of which had wintered in the straits of Belleisle and escaped the distemper. A physician of note supposed this morta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty to be occasioned by a dearth among the Indians the two preceding years, so that they had but little corn or any other farinaceous food, and this year had been some months with|out, which caused them to fall upon their pompions, squoshes, &amp;c. before they were ripe, and this food brought their blood into a putrid and broken state. It is remarkable that the English inhabi|tants were free from the distemper, and not one person died of it. The infection was supposed by some to be taken from an Irish brigantine, but Mr. Timothy Folger, a sensible gentleman of the island, from whom I received the foregoing account, assured me there was no room to suppose so, or that it came from abroad.</P>
<P>Our ancestors supposed an immediate interposition of providence in the great mortality among the Indians to make room for the settlement of the English. I am not inclined to credulity, but should not we go into the contrary extreme if we were to take no notice of the extinction of this people in all parts of the continent: In some the English have made use of means the most likely to have prevented it, but all to no purpose. Notwithstanding their frequent rup|tures with the English, very few comparatively have perished by wars. They waste, they moulder away, and as Charlevoix says of the Indians of Canada, they disappear.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>MR. Haynes who had lately come over was chosen to the place of assistant. The governor and assistants kept the powers of government both legislative and executive very much in their hands the three first years. The peo|ple began to grow uneasy, and the number of freemen being greatly multiplied an alteration of the constitution seems to have been agreed upon or fallen into by a general consent of the towns, for at a general court for elections in 1634, twenty four of the principal inhabitants appeared as the representatives of the body of freemen, and before they proceeded to the election
<PB N="36" REF="009705_0023_0F7A456529D077C0">
of magistrates the people asserted their right to a greater share in the government than had hitherto been allowed them, and resolved
<Q>That none but the general court had power to make and establish laws or to elect and appoint officers, as governor, deputy governor, assistants, treasurer, secretary, captains, lieutenants, ensigns, or any of like mo|ment or to remove such upon misdemeanor or to set out the duties and powers of these officers&mdash;That none but the general court hath power to raise monies and taxes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to dispose of lands, viz. to give and confirm proprieties.</Q>
After these resolutions they proceeded to the election of magistrates. Then they further determined
<Q>That there shall be four general courts held yearly, to be summoned by the governor for the time being and not to be dissolved without the consent of the major part of the court&mdash;That it shall be lawful for the freemen of each plantation to chuse two or three before every general court to con|fer of and prepare such business as by them shall be thought fit to consider of at the next court, and that such persons as shall be hereafter so deputed by the freemen of the several plantations to deal in their behalf in the affairs of the commonwealth, shall have the full power and voices of all the said freemen derived to them for the making and establishing of laws, granting of lands, &amp;c. and to deal in all other affairs of the commonwealth wherein the freemen have to do, the matter of election of magistrates and other officers only excepted, wherein every freeman is to give his own voice.</Q>&mdash;And to show their resentment they imposed a fine upon the court of assistants for going contrary to an order of the general court.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Mass.

<P>THE freemen were so increased that it was impractica|ble to debate and determine matters in a body, it was be|sides unsafe on account of the Indians and prejudicial to their private affairs to be so long absent from their families and business, so that this representative body was a thing of necessity, but no provision had been made for it in their character.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009705_0023_0F7A456529D077C0">THUS they settled the legislative body which, except an alteration of the number of general courts which were soon reduced to two only in a year and other not very material circumstances, continued the same as long as the charter lasted. This I suppose was the second house of representatives in any of the colonies. There was as has been observed no express provision for it in the charter, they supposed the natural rights of Englishmen reserved to them implied it.

That church had invited him upon his first coming to New-England, but the go|vernor and council interposed with their advice and pre|vented his settlement at that time. He had refused to join in communion with the church at Boston, because they would not make a publick declaration of their repentance for holding communion with the church of England whilst they lived there. He was charged with divers exception|able tenets, as

There were many others, as Mr. Bellingham, Mr. Dummer, of the magistrates, Mr. R.

and distinction were expected to come over, some of which are said to have been prevented by express order of the King, as Mr. Pym, Mr. Hampden, Sir Arthur Haslerigg, Oliver Cromwell, &amp;c. I know this is questioned by some au|thors, but it appears plainly by a letter from Lord Say and Seal to Mr. Vane, and a letter from Mr. Cotton to the same nobleman as I take it, though his name is not men|tioned, and an answer to certain demands made by him, that his Lordship himself and Lord Brooke and others were not without thoughts of removing to New-England, and that several other persons of quality were in treaty about their removal also, but undetermined whether to join the Massachusets or to settle a new colony. By the charter the number of assistants might be eighteen, but hitherto they had chosen a less number, from 6 to 9, which left room as any getleman of distinction came over to admit him to a share in the government without leaving out any of the former assistants.</P>
<P>IT appears by the demands just mentioned that some of the nobility and principal commoners of that day had what appears at this day to be very strange apprehensions of the relation they should stand in to Great-Britain, after their removal to America. Many of the proposals were such as imply that they thought themselves at full liberty without any charter from the crown to establish such sort of government as they thought proper, and to form a new state as fully to all intents and purposes as if they had been in a state of nature and were making their first en|trance into civil society. The importance of the colonies to the nation was not fully understood and considered. Perhaps the party which then prevailed in England would have been content to have been rid of the heads of what was deem'd a faction in the government and to have had no further connexion with them. Be that as it may, this sentiment in persons of such figure and distinction will in a great measure excuse the same mistake which will ap|pear to have been made by our first settlers, in many instances in the course of our history. The answer made
<PB N="43" REF="009705_0026_0F7A45674CE4E740">

They did not take their departure until June the next year, and then about an hundred persons in the first company, some of them had lived in splendor and delicacy in England, set out on foot to travel an hundred and twenty or thirty miles with their wives and children, near a fortnight's journey, having no pillars but Jacob's and no canopy but the heavens, a wilderness to go through without the least cultivation, in most places no path nor any marks to guide them, depending upon the compass to steer by, many hideous swamps and very high mountains besides five or six rivers or different parts of the same winding river (the Chickapi) not every where fordable, which they could not avoid. The greatest part of the lands they were going to were evidently without the jurisdiction of the Massa|chusets,

<P>THE Plimouth people notwithstanding the French piracy in 1632 kept possession of their house at Penobscot and carried on trade with the Indians, but in 1635 Rossil|lon commander of a French fort at La Have upon the Nova Scotia shore sent a French man of war to Penobscot, which took possession of the trading house and all the goods. The French gave their bills for the goods and sent away all the men. The commander wrote to the governor of Plimouth that he had orders to displace all the English as far as Pemaquid, but to those westward he would shew all courtesy. The Plimouth government who supposed they had good right to the place were not willing to put up the injury quietly, and hired a large ship of some force the Hope of Ipswich in England,&mdash;Girling comman|der, to displace the French. Girling was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have two hundred pounds if he effected it. A bark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 20 men was sent with him as a tender. But the French having notice of the design fortified the place and Girling having

near spent his ammunition sent the bark to the Massachu|sets for aid. Two persons came from Plimouth also to treat about it, and the court agreed to assist their neigh|bours by a subscription among themselves, but provision was so scarce that there could not sufficient be had sud|denly to fit out an expedition of an hundred men only, so the matter was deferred to a further time and Girling returned, leaving the French in possession which they continued until 1654.</P>
<P>THE situation the colony was in at this time must have given them a threatning prospect; the French on their borders on one side, the Dutch on the other, the Indians in the midst restrained only by want of union among themselves from breaking up all settlements, they being utterly defenceless.</P>
<P>THIS year Mr. Winthrop, jun. returned from England, whither he had gone the year before, and brought a commission<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How can we account for it that they should imagine they had a right to settle colonies and establish what form of government they pleased? Ten years after, it might well enough be supposed, but this was several years before the confusions in England began.</NOTE> from the Lord Say and Seale and Lord Brook and others to be their governor of their plantation at Con|necticut. A fort was built at the mouth of the river known by the name of Saybrook fort. He brought also a number of men with arms ammunition and stores, and two thousand pounds in money to bring forward a settlement. This commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">on interfered with the intended settlements by the Massachusets; notwithstanding that, as a number of the inhabitants of Watertown had possessed themselves of a fine piece of meadow at Weathersfield below Hartford where Mr. Hooker and his company settled, the agents for the Lords, being well disposed to promote the general good, permitted these settlers quietly to enjoy their posses|sions. The fortress below struck terror into the Indians and quieted the minds of the English. Plimouth was dis|satisfied with being thus supplanted by the Massachusets (the Dorchester men as I suppose having pitched upon
<PB N="48" REF="009705_0029_0F7A45698903A1E8">
the spot where Plimouth had built a trading house and as they alledged had purchased the lands of the Indians) and demanded an hundred pounds or part of the land. There was great danger of a warm contention between the two colonies, but at length the Dorchester men made such of|fers of satisfaction that Plimouth accepted them. The Dutch also sent home to Holland for instructions intend|ing to maintain their claim to the river or the place where they had possession, but upon a treaty afterwards with the commissioners of the united colonies they quitted all claim to all parts of the river resigning it up to the English.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR Ferdinando Gorges and Capt. Mason having been at more expence and taken more pains than any other mem|bers of the grand council of Plimouth, and perceiving no prospect of any equivalent return, and fearing from the great clamour in the nation against monopolies that they should e'er long be forced to resign up their grand charter they entred this year upon a new project, viz. to procure a general governor for the whole country of New-England to be forthwith sent over, and because the Massachusets charter stood in their way they endeavoured a revocation of it, that so the whole from St. Croix to Maryland might be brought under the same form of government. The settlement of the Dutch at Manhados which lay within those limits, both then and at all other times was consider|ed by the English court as an intrusion as indeed it was. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1609 Henry Hudson an Englishman, from some misunderstand|ing between the East-India company and him, engaged in the Dutch service. On his return from the streights and bay which bear his name he made the first discovery of Hudson's river and went up as far as Aurania (Albany) or near to it. The Dutch a few years after built a small house or fort there for the sake of trade, pretending no title to the country. It has been observed that the English who came to New-Plimouth intended in 1620 to have settled there. Neglected by the English court the Dutch began a settlement soon after. It has been sometimes urged that the line of the Massachusets charter which extends to the South-Sea or until it meets the settlements of some other christian prince or state, was so expressed from a particular regard to this Dutch settlement, and that a line to extend to the Spanish settlements was too extravagant to have been intended, but the Dutch were never allowed by the English to have any title to the country, and at the time of granting the charter there were only a few stragglers there. Cromwell and the parliament before him con|sidered them as intruders and blamed the English colonies that they had not extirpated them. The geography of this part of America was less understood than it is at present. A line to the Spanish settlements was imagined to be much shorter than it really was. Some of Champlain's people in the beginning of the last century, who had been but a few days on a march from Quebeck, returned with great joy supposing that from the top of a high mountain they had discovered the South Sea.</NOTE>

<P>THE proposed divisions of the twelve provinces were as follows. The first was from St. Croix to Pema|quid, the second from Pemaquid to Sagadehoc, the third contained the land between the rivers Amarascoggin and Kenebeck, the fourth along the sea-coast from Sagadehoc to Piscataqua, the fifth from Piscataqua to Naumkeak, the sixth from Naumkeak round the sea-coast by Cape Cod to Naraganset, the seventh from Naraganset to the half-way bound betwixt that and Connecticut river, and so 50 miles up into the country, the eighth from the half-way bound to Connecticut river, and so fifty miles into the country, the ninth from Connecticut river along the sea-coast to Hudson's river and so up thirty miles, the tenth from the thirty miles end to cross up forty miles eastward, the ele|venth from the west side of Hudson's river thirty miles up the country towards the 40th degree where New England beginneth. The twelfth from the end of the 30 miles up the said river, northward thirty miles further and from thence to cross into the land forty miles. And out of every one of these provinces was 5000 acres to be granted to certain persons there named in lieu of some former grants made to each of them in those divisions which they were now to surrender, and to hold to each man his 5000 acres

in fee of the Lord of the province. And the Lord of every one of those twelve provinces was to send the same year ten men with the general governor well provided.</P>
<P>TO all which was added,</P>
<P>"IT is humbly desired that your Lordships would be pleased to order these things following:</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the patent for the plantation of the Massa|chusets-Bay may be revoked, and that all those who have any other grants within any of these provinces, whether they have planted or not upon any part of the same, yet they shall enjoy their lands laying down their jura regalia if they had any, and paying some reasonable acknowledg|ment as freeholders to the Lord of the province of whom they are now to take new grants of their said lands, and in case any of their lands shall be found having exorbitant bounds to have been unlawfully obtained they shall be reduced to a lesser proportion as may be fit for the grantor who is undertaker under the direction of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. And if the grantee shall be any ways refractory and refuse to surrender and hold anew of the said Lord of the province, that then your Lordships will take order by such course as law will permit to make void the same.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT every river which parts two provinces shall equally belong half way over to the provinces they lie contiguous unto.</P>

<P>A copy of some grant or agreement concerning one of the provinces to Capt. Mason was sent over signed Lenox, Hamilton, Arundel and Surry, Carlisle, Stirling, Edward Gorges, Ferd. Gorges. Attested by Thomas Maydwell Not. Pub. It has been said that the Marquiss of Hamilton and the Earl of Stirling both obtained the like instruments, and it is possible all the others might also. It is not ma|terial at this day whether they did or not. It is certain that above an hundred years are past and no possession taken, or improvements made by them or their assigns in consequence thereof, and all the territory is either included in other grants, some made before this surrender, by the

Many houses were blown down and many more uncovered, the Indian corn every where beat down to the ground so as not to rise again: The tide rose twenty feet perpendicular. At Naraganset the Indians were obliged to betake themselves to the trees and yet many of them were drowned, the tide of flood returning before the usual time for it.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the year 1636 Mr. Vane was chosen governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE> Mr. Winthrop deputy governor, and Mr. Harlakenden who came in the same ship with Mr. Vane was added to the assistants. The people of the colony very early discovered that they were not without disposition to novelty and change. It was not meerly out of policy to encourage others that they took early notice of such as came over from year to year. Besides this motive they were easily captivated with the appearance only of wisdom and piety, professions of a regard to liberty and of a strong attach|ment to the publick interest. Mr. Haynes who seemed to stand most in the way of Mr. Winthrop had left the colony and was settled at Connecticut, and Mr. Winthrop would have had a good prospect of recovering his former share of the people's favor, if Mr. Vane's grave solemn deportment, although he was not then above 24 or 25 years of age, had not engaged almost the whole colony in his favor. There was a great friendship between Mr. Cotton and him which seems to have continued to the last.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A small house which he lived in at the side of the hill above Queen-street he gave to Mr. Cotton, who made an addition to it after Mr. Vane went away, and lived and died there.</NOTE> He had great respect shewn him at first. He took more state upon him than any governor had ever done before. When he went either to the court or to church four serjeants walked before him with their halberds. His ad|ministration for several months met with great applause. Towards the end of the year the people grew discontented.

He perceived it and grew weary of the government. Receiving letters from London in December urging his return home he first communicated them to the council and then called the general court together to ask their consent to his quitting the administration. He declared to them the necessity of his departure, and such of the council as had seen the letters affirmed that the reasons were very urgent but not fit to be imparted to the whole court. The court took time until the morning to consider, when one of the assistants lamenting the loss of such a governor in a time of such danger both from French and Indians, the governor burst into tears and professed that howsoever the causes propounded for his departure did concern the utter ruin of his outward estate, yet he would rather have hazarded all than have gone from them at such a time, if something else had not pressed him more, viz. the inevitable danger of God's judgments which he feared were coming upon them for the differences and dissentions which he saw amongst them and the scandalous imputation brought upon himself, as if he should be the cause of all, and therefore he thought it was best for him to give place for a time. The court did not think fit to consent to his going for such reasons. He found he had gone too far and recalled himself, professing that the reasons which concerned his own estate were sufficient to satisfy him and therefore desired he might have leave; the other passage slipped from him out of passion not judgment. Whereupon the court agreed that it was ne|cessary to give way to his departure, and ordered another meeting of the general court to make choice of a go|vernor and deputy governor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In case the deputy should be chose governor as was expected.</NOTE> and as it was in the midst of winter (15 December) the freemen had liberty to send their votes in writing if they did not come in person. Some of the church of Boston loth to part with the go|vernor met together and agreed that it was not necessary for the reasons alledged that the governor should depart, and sent some of their number to signify as much to the
<PB N="55" REF="009705_0032_0F7A456BB95F7448">
court. The governor pretended to be overpowered and expressed himself to be such an obedient son of the church that notwithstanding the licence of the court, yet without the consent of the church he durst not go away. A great part of the people who were informed of this transaction declared their purpose still to continue him, and it was thought adviseable when the day appointed for election came to adjourn the court to May, the time of the annual choice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mass. records&mdash;Hubbard.</NOTE> Mr. Vane has been charged with as dark dis|simulation a few years after in affairs of vastly greater im|portance, particularly in the manner of giving his testimo|ny in the case of the Earl of Strafford.</P>
<P>THERE came over with Mr. Cotton or about the same time Mr. Hutchinson, and his family, who had lived at Alford in the neighbourhood of Boston. Mr. Hutchin|son had a good estate and was of good reputation. His wife as Mr. Cotton says
<Q>was well beloved, and all the faithful embraced her conference and blessed God for her fruitful discourses.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Answer to Bailey.</NOTE> After she came to New England she was treated with respect and much notice was taken of her by Mr. Cotton and other principal persons, and particular|ly by Mr. Vane the governor. Her husband served in the general court several elections as a representative for Boston until he was excused at the desire of the church.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. William Hutchinson was discharged from assisting at the par|ticular courts at the request of the church.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Mass. Rec. Dec.</HI> 1636.</BIBL></NOTE> So much respect seems to have increased her natural va|nity. Countenanced and encouraged by Mr. Vane and Mr. Cotton she advanced doctrines and opinions which in|volved the colony in disputes and contentions, and being improved to civil as well as religious purposes had like to have produced ruin both to church and state. The vigi|lance of some, of whom Mr. Winthrop was the chief, pre|vented, and turned the ruin from the country upon herself and many of her family and particular friends. Mr. Wheel|wright a zealous minister, of character for learning and piety was her brother in law and firmly attached to her,
<PB N="56" REF="009705_0033_0F7A456D6BD3A290">
and finally suffered with her. Besides the meetings for public worship on the Lord's day, the stated lecture every thursday in Boston, and other occasional lectures in other towns, there were frequent private meetings of the bre|thren of the churches for religious exercises. Mrs. Hutch|inson thought fit to set up a meeting of the sisters also, where she repeated the sermons preached the Lord's day before, adding her remarks and expositions. Her lectures made much noise and sixty or eighty principal women at|tended them. At first they were generally approved of. After some time it appeared she had distinguished the mi|nisters and members of churches through the country, a small part of them under a covenant of grace the rest un|der a covenant of works. The whole colony was soon di|vided into two parties and however distant one party was from the other in principle they were still more so in af|fection. The two capital errors with which she was charged were these. That the Holy Ghost dwells personally in a justified person, and that nothing of sanctification can help to evidence to believers their justification. From these two, a great number of others were said to flow which were enumerated and condemned at a synod held the next year. The ministers of the several parts of the country alarmed with these things came to Boston whilst the gene|ral court was sitting, and some time before the governor Mr. Vane asked his dismission. They conferred with Mr. Cotton and Mr. Wheelwright upon those two points. The last they both disclaimed so far as to acknowledge that sanctification did help to evidence justification, the other they qualified at least by other words, they held the indwelling of the person of the Holy Ghost but not strictly a personal union, or as they express it, not a communicating of personal proprieties. The governor not only held with Mr. Cotton but went further or was more express and maintained a personal union. Mr. Winthrop the deputy governor denied both, and Mr. Wilson the other minister of Boston and many of the ministers in the country joined with him. A conference or disputation was determined
<PB N="57" REF="009705_0033_0F7A456D6BD3A290">
on, which they agreed should be managed in writing as most likely to tend to the peace of the church. When they could not find that the scriptures nor the primitive church for the first 300 years ever used the term person of the Holy Ghost they generally thought it was best it should be forborn as being of hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an invention. Upon the other question Mr. Cotton in a sermon, the day the court met, had acknowledged that evident sanctification is a ground of justification, and went on to say that in cases of spiritual desertion true desire of sanctification was found to be sanctification as divines usually held, and fur|ther, if a man was laid so flat upon the ground as that he could see no desires, but only as a bruised reed did wait at the foot of Christ yet here was matter of comfort, for this was found to be true sanctification in the root and principle of it. Mr. Vane and he both denied that any of these or any degree of sanctification could be evident without a concurrent sight of justification.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE> The town and country were distracted with these subtleties, and every man and woman who had brains enough to form some imperfect conceptions of them inferred and maintained some other point such as these; a man is justified before he believes; faith is no cause of justification; and if faith be before justification it is only a passive faith, an empty vessel, &amp;c. and assurance is by immediate revelation only. The fear of God and love of our neighbour seemed to be laid by and out of the question. All the church of Boston except four or five joined with Mr. Cotton. Mr. Wilson the other minister and most of the ministers in the country opposed him.</P>
<P>TO increase the flame Mr. Wheelwright preached a sermon (Jan. 19) in which, besides carrying antinomianism to the heighth, he made use of some expressions which were laid hold of by the court as tending to sedition, for which he was sent for and examined whilst Mr. Vane was in office, but a full enquiry and determination was sus|pended until a more convenient time.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="009705_0034_0F7A456DF0C93A30">WHILST these contentions were thus increasing within, the Pequods, the most warlike of all the Indians, were plot|ting destruction from without. After Stone and his com|pany were murdered they sent messengers to Boston to make peace, pretending that the murder was committed by a few bad fellows who had fled to the Dutch. Their ambassadors were courteously treated and the terms of peace were agreed on. In confidence of their fidelity John Oldham, of whom mention has been made before, went in a small bark to trade with the Indians at Block Island. They murdered him but spared two boys and two Nara|ganset Indians who were of his company. The murderers were discovered by the crew of a small vessel one Gallop master from Connecticut which happened to come upon them soon after the fact. Gallop had with him only one man and two boys and no arms except two muskets and two pistols. Altho' the deck was full of Indians who had guns, swords, &amp;c. yet as they were then not much used to them they made but little resistance, and when he boarded the vessel they jumped into the sea and many of them were drowned. He found Oldham's body not cold, his brains beat out and his limbs hacked off. Block Island was under the Nara|ganset Indians but they denied their having any concern in the murder. The murderers were sheltered and pro|tected by the Pequods, who at the same time surprized divers English in Connecticut river. These proceedings caused the Massachusets to send fourscore men by water under Captain Endicot who had instructions to offer peace to the Indians upon their delivering up the murtherers; if they refused to do it then to attack them. A great num|ber of them entered into some sort of parley by a messen|ger and interpreter, keeping at a great distance themselves, but assoon as they knew the terms they fled into the woods. Winter was approaching and Mr. Endicot thought it ad|viseable to return home in order to prepare for a more general attack the next summer. There were some severe reflections cast upon him for not pursuing the enemy at that time. The Pequods in the winter attempted an union
<PB N="59" REF="009705_0034_0F7A456DF0C93A30">
with the Naragansets. There had been a fixed inveterate enmity between the two tribes, but on this occasion the Pequods were willing to smother it, their enmity against the English being the strongest of the two, and although they had never heard the story of Polyphem&eacute; and Ulysses, yet they artfully urged that the English were come to dispossess them of their country, and that all the Nara|gansets could hope for from their friendship was the favour of being the last devoured; whereas if the Indians would unite they might easily destroy the English, or force them to leave the country without being exposed themselves to any hazard. They need not come to open battles: Firing their houses, killing their cattle, and lying in wait for them as they went about their ordinary business would soon deprive them of all means of subsisting. But the Naragansets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Naraganset sachem and Uncas sachem of the Moheges sent to the English and offered their service to join with them against the Pequods.

They proposed to join in war against the Pequods and that neither English nor Indians should make peace with them but utterly destroy them. The governor for form sake took time until the next morning to give an answer, and then the following articles were agreed to.</P>
<P N="1">1. A FIRM and perpetual peace betwixt them and the English.</P>
<P N="2">2. NEITHER party to make peace with the Pequods without the consent of the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the Naragansets should not harbour any Pequods.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT they should put to death or deliver up any murderers of the English.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="60" REF="009705_0035_0F7A457106876300">5. THAT they should return fugitive servants.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE English to give them notice when to go out against the Peqouds and the Naragansets to furnish guides.</P>
<P N="7">7. FREE trade to be carried on between the parties.</P>
<P N="8">8. NONE of the Naragansets to come near the English plantation during the war with the Pequods without some Englishman or Indian known to the English.</P>
<P>CUSHAMAQUIN a Sachem of the Massachusets Indians also became a party to the treaty.</P>
<P>INDIAN fidelity is proverbial in New-England as Punick was in Rome. The Naragansets are said to have kept to the treaty until the Pequods were destroyed, and then they grew insolent and treacherous.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of the year religious heats became more violent, and the civil affairs more sensibly affected by them. The people of Boston in general were in favour of Mr. Vane the governor, the rest of the towns in general for Mr. Winthrop the deputy governor. At a sessions of the court in March it was moved that the court of elections for 1637 should not be held in Boston but in Newtown (Cambridge.) Nothing could be more mortifying to the governor, and as he could not hinder the vote by a nega|tive he refused to put the question. Mr. Winthrop the deputy governor as he lived in Boston excused himself, and the court required Mr. Endicot one of the assistants to do it. It was carried for the removal.</P>
<P>THE more immediate occasion of the court's resentment against Boston was a petition signed by a great number of the principal inhabitants of that town, together with some belonging to other towns, judging and condemning the court for their proceedings against Mr. Wheelwright. At this session Mr. Vane the governor could not prevent a censure upon one Stephen Greensmith for saying that all the ministers except Mr. Cotton, Mr. Wheelwright, and he thought Mr. Hooker, preached a covenant of works. He was required to make an acknowledgment to the satisfaction of the magistrates and ministers, was fined forty pounds, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mass. Records.</NOTE></P>

Mr. Vane professed himself ready to serve the cause of God in the meanest capacity. He was notwithstanding much mortified and discovered his resentment. Although he had sat at church among the magistrates from his first arrival, yet he and those who had been left out with him placed themselves with the deacons, and when he was in|vited by the governor to return to his place he refused it.</P>

The penalty on private persons was forty pounds, and twenty pounds besides for every month they continued in the offence.

<P>MR. Vane, in company with Lord Leigh son of theEarl of Marlborough who came to see the country, sailed for England the beginning of August, where he had a much larger field opened. The nation at that time was disposed to receive very favorably men of his genius and cast of mind. The share he had in the revolution there and his un|happy fate upon the restoration of King Charles the second are too well known to need any notice here. He came into New-England under peculiar advantages. His father was one of the privy council. He himself had the friend|ship of the Lord Say and Seal who was in the highest esteem in the colony. He made great professions of re|ligion, and conformed to the peculiar scruples of that day. I have seen a long letter wrote to him while he was on ship-board by one of the passengers in the same ship, ap|plauding him for honoring God so far as to shorten his hair upon his arrival in England from France and urging a compleat reformation by bringing it to the primitive length and form. It was with much difficulty he could obtain his father's consent to come over, but his inclina|tion was so strong that at length he had leave of absence for three years. It is said that the King being acquainted with Mr. Vane's disposition commanded the father, who had no great affection for the religion of New-England, to

gratify him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE> However this may have been, it was be|lieved in New-England to be true, and with the other circumstances mentioned strongly recommended him. Part of his business was the settlement of Connecticut, in con|junction with Mr. Winthrop the governor's son, as agents for Lord Say and Seal and Lord Brooke, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Warwick obtained a grant of the sea coast from Nara|ganset river to the south-west 40 leagues to keep the breadth to the south sea.

The administration of a young and unexperienced but obstinate and self-sufficient governor could not but be dis|liked by the major part of the people, and at the next election they not only would not so much as chuse him an assistant, but made an order that no man for the time to come should be qualified for the place of governor until he had been at least one whole year in the country.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I do not find this order in the records. It is mentioned by Mr. Hubbard who was then on the spot.</NOTE> A letter wrote from New-England shews the sense they had of him after they had made trial.
<Q>Mr. Vane coming from England a young gentleman was presently elected governor, and before he was half warm in his seat, to shew his spirit, began to broach new tenets drawn from the lees of one Mr. Wheelwright, agitated with such vio|lence as if they had been matters of that consequence that the peace and welfare of New-England must be
<PB N="65" REF="009705_0037_0F7A457279834FF8">
sacrificed rather than they should not take place. Divi|sions are always dangerous, never safe, never more dan|gerous than in a new settled government. Yet this man altogether ignorant of the art of government thinks it not enough to set the house on fire but must add oil to the flame, and so far had the bandying of these things proceeded that it was of God's great mercy it ended not in our destruction. It is fit that something should be said of the man that put us into this danger. Truly by his aspect you would judge him a good man. Yet I am persuaded he hath kindled those sparks among us which many ages will not be able to extinguish. But the wisdom of the state put a period to his government before he had run out his circuit. They were necessi|tated to undo the work of their own hands, and leave a blemish upon that rash undertaking for posterity to de|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant upon and a caveat to us, that all men are not fit for government, and none so dangerous when he is up as one that makes his affection his rule. But this disgrace took so deep an impression that partly from a sense of it, and partly from a consciousness how ill he had deserved of us through his heat of indiscretion, he exchanged New-England for Old.</Q>
Lord Say and Seal speaking of him after his arrival in England, in a letter to Mr. Cotton says
<Q>For the young man Mr. Vane whom your love followeth, and its well it doth so for he may be recovered, I have not been wanting to do my endeavour to shew him the danger of his way and what hath been the sad issue thereof in others, from whence I think it cometh, and whither Satan's aim is to drive it, as might have appear|ed to you by my letters written to him unto New-Eng|land when I first did perceive his delusions, if he had shewn my letters to you.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><P>After all that has been said to the disadvantage of Mr. Vane's character it ought to be remembred to his honor that notwith|standing standing the slights put upon him by the colony, he shewed a truly christian spirit of forgiveness, for when in the year 1644 an attachment was made of the effects of alderman Berkley of London, in the Massachusets colony, at the suit of the lady La Tour and judgment given for &pound;. 2000 sterling and no appeal admitted, a heavy complaint was made against the government and they were threatned with the loss of their privileges, Sir H.

In fine, seeing himself on all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands in an evil case he resolved for New-England. In order to this, striking in with some non-conformists which intended that way, his honorable birth, long hair, and other circumstances of his person rendered his fellow travellers jealous of him as a spy to betray their liberty rather than any way like to advantage their design. But he that they thought at first sight to have too little of Christ for their company did soon after appear to have too much for them. For he had not been long in New-England but he ripened into more knowledge and experience of Christ than the churches there could bear the testimony of. Even New-England could not bear all his words though there was no King's court or King's chapel. Then he returns for Old England.</Q></P>

I have, Madam, whilst I own a love to my country a deep interest in the publick loss which so many worthy persons lament. The world is robbed of an unparallelled example of virtue and piety. His great abilities made his enemies persuade themselves that all the revolutions in the last age were wrought by his influence, as if the world was moved only by his engine. In him they lodged all the dying hopes of the party. There was no opportunity that he did not improve for the advantage of his country. And when he was in his last and much deplored state he strove to make the people in love with that freedom they had so foolishly and lavishly thrown away.&mdash;He was great in all his actions but to me he seemed greatest in his sufferings, when his enemies seemed to fear that he alone should be able to acquaint them with a change of fortune.

of any erroneous opinions, but waited the determination of the churches in a general council, accordingly a synod was appointed to be held at Newtown the 30th of August, where were present not only the ministers and messengers of churches but the magistrates also, who Mr. Weld says (I suppose he was a member) were not only hearers but speakers also as they thought fit. Mr. Cotton altho' at the head of the ministers was too much a party to be proper for a moderator, and Mr. Hooker and M. Bulkley were chosen. Three weeks were spent in disputing pro and con and at length above fourscore points or opinions said to have been maintained by some or other in the country were condemned as erroneous, and the result was signed by all the members but Mr. Cotton. He had expressed

Mr. Hooker at first disapproved of determining the points in controversy by a synod. He writes to Mr. Shepard of Newtown April 8. 1636. (It should be 37)
<Q>For your general synod I cannot yet see either how reasonable or how salutable it will be for your turn, for the settling and establishing the truth in that honorable way as were to be desired. My ground is this. They will be chief agents in the synod who are chief parties in the cause, and for them only who are prejudiced in the controversy to pass sentence against cause or person how improper! how unprofitable! My present thoughts run thus: That such conclusions which are most extra, most er|roneous, and cross to the common current, send them over to the godly learned to judge in our own country and return their apprehensions. I suppose the issue will be more uncontroulable. If any should suggest this was the way to make the clamour too great and loud and to bring a prejudice upon the plantations. I should soon answer there is nothing done in corners here but it is openly there related, and in such notorious cases which cannot be kept secret the most plain and naked relation ever causeth the truth most to appear and prevents all groundless and needless jealousies, where|by men are apt to make things more and worse than they are.</Q></P>
<P>ALTHO' two of the elders were the moderators or prolocutors of the assembly yet Mr. Winthrop seems to have had a controuling power. An anonymous writer of a manuscript sent from New-England the same year gives this account of it.
<Q>The synod being met much time is spent in ventilation and emptying of private passions, at

They expelled two of their own members Aspinwall and Coggeshall, one for signing and the other for justifying it, and sent a warrant to the town of Boston to return two other deputies in their room. The town agreed to send them back, but Mr. Cotton hearing of it went to the meeting and prevented it, and they chose two others, one of which had signed the pe|tition and was therefore dismissed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE> The court then sent

Records.</NOTE></P>
<P>MRS. Hutchinson was next called to her trial before the whole court and many of the elders. An ancient manuscript of the trial at large having been preserved dis|covers nothing in her conduct but what might naturally be expected from a high degree of enthusiasm. Her no|tions of revelations do not seem to have been altogether discountenanced by Mr. Cotton himself. Her sentence upon record stands thus:
<Q>Mrs. Hutchinson the wife of Mr. William Hutchinson being convented for tra|ducing the ministers and their ministry in the country, she declared voluntarily her revelations and that she should be delivered and the court ruined with their posterity, and thereupon was banished, and in the mean while was committed to Mr. Joseph Weld (of Roxbury) until the court shall dispose of her.</Q>
Having received her sentence from the court she had a further trial to go through in the church. She was first admonished. Mr. Cotton says that Mr. Davenport and he imagined they had convinced her of her errors, and she presented what was called a recantation under her hand, but at the same time professed that she never was of any other judgment than what she now held forth. The recantation is not preserved. She had, no doubt, some fine spun distinctions, too commonly made use of in theological controversies&punc; to serve as a subterfuge if there be occasion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cotton in a letter to Mr. Stone at Hartford says,

lawful which will hardly consist with the rules of morality. No wonder she was immoderately vain when she found magistrates and ministers embracing the novelties advanced by her. The whole church of Boston, a few members excepted, were her converts. At length she for|sook the public assemblies and set up what she called a purer worship in her own family. It's not improbable she was encouraged herein by Mr. Vane who some years after fell into the same practice in England. Mr. Hooker who had been charged by her with want of soundness in the faith in return expresses himself with some acrimony con|cerning her.
<Q>THE expression of providence against this wretched woman hath proceeded from the Lord's mira|culous mercy and his bare arm hath been discovered therein from first to last that all the churches may hear and fear. I do believe such a heap of hideous errors at once to be vented by such a self deluding and deluded creature no history can record, and yet after recantation of all to be cast out as unsavory salt that she may not continue a pest to the place, that will be for ever mar|vellous in the eyes of all the saints. It will not get out of my mind and heart but there is a mystery in the closure and upshot of this business, but he that carries the wisdom of the crafty headlong is able to lay open that also in his season. At the first reading of your relation I could not but suspect so much, may be it is but my melancholick suspicion, but these three things presented themselves in open view to my mind, 1. That it was never intended she should be excommunicated. 2. That her recantation was still with so much reserva|tion as sinks the mind of such who would have made way for her escape, viz. That our election is first evi|denced. 3. That this conceit is a nest egg to breed and bring in many other false imaginations if it be stretched to its breadth. Add also hereunto that there is no odds from herself but only in some expressions and misprisions that way as she would have men think, and then you have the whole cause where it was conceived in a nar|rower

<Q>The next piece of wickedness I am to mind you of is your barba|rous action committed against Mrs. Ann Hutchinson whom you first imprisoned then banished, and so exposed her to that desolate condition that she fell into the hands of the Indians who mur|dered her and her family except one child, and after that made a notorious lie on the destroyed woman, which Samuel Clark priest of London, taking the lie out of his brother Weld's short story, must needs put into his book called God's judgments against heresy&mdash;The woman before mentioned having been by the priests and pro|fessors pumped and sifted to get something against her, laying their snares to entrap her, and taking their opportunity when her husband and friends, as it was said, were absent, examined and banished her.&mdash;So she goes by water with many others who per|ceived they must go to pot next, and providentially fell in with Rhode-Island, where they made a cave or caves and in them lived until the cold winter was past, in which time it was known to the professors where they were and that they had bought the island of the Indians. And the professors began to stir and endeavour to bring the island within the compass of their patent; so the poor molested woman it is like let in fear and thought she would go far enough from their reach, so going southward to seek a place to settle upon, where she and her family might live in quietness, fell upon a piece of land that was in controversy between the Dutch and the Natives, and the Natives being in a heat came upon them and were the executioners of what the New-England priests, ma|gistrates and church members were the occasion through their wicked and cruel proceedings in forcing them to flee from their rage and fury.&mdash;So, reader, thou mayst see the rage and envy of this professing generation, for they imprisoned and banished this tenderly bred woman in or towards winter and what with fears and tossings to and fro the woman miscarried, upon which they grounded their abominable untruth.

It is difficult to discover from Mr. Cotton's own account of his principles published ten years afterwards in his answer to Bailey wherein he differed from her. Her warm imagination was more wrought upon by the enthu|siastic tenet than his placid temper. He seems to have been in danger when she was upon trial.

The other ministers treated him coldly, but Mr. Winthrop whose influence was now greater than ever protected him. Not long after in a sermon at a fast Dec. 13, 1638, he confessed and bewailed the churches and his own security and credulity, be means whereof so many dangerous errors had spread, and shewed how he came to be deceived; the errors being formed, in words, so near the truth which he had preached, and the falshood of the maintainers of them being such that they usually would deny to him what they had maintained to others.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE> His conduct in this day of temptation was forgotten and he soon recovered and to his death preserved the esteem and respect of the whole colony.</P>

<P>A great number removed out of the jurisdiction, some of them being banished, some disfranchised; more to Rhode Island than to any other place. In a short time most of them were permitted to return and were restored to their former privileges. The most of those errors which were condemned by the synod, its probable, they never would have owned as their principles, and they appear rather to be deduced by some of the synod as naturally following from the capital opinions than to have been advanced by the opinionists themselves, or perhaps may have been unguardedly dropped by particular persons in the heat of their disputes, or during an enthusiastick frenzy, and in others may have been the effect of a fond fancy for paradoxical tenets. They were charged indeed with principles which admit and introduce all kinds of im|morality, and which make no distinction between virtue and vice. So are fatalists and predestinarians. Many of them were afterwards employed in posts of honor and trust were exemplary in their lives and conversations, and their letters and private papers shew that they were pious and devout, and with the name of antinomians paid the strictest regard to moral virtue. The opinionists were punished for being deluded enthusiasts. The other side were deluded also by a zeal, for the punishment for the honor of God, of such of his creatures as differed in opinion from themselves. It is evident not only by Mrs. Hutchinson's trial but by many other public pro|ceedings, that inquisition was made into men's private judgments as well as into their declarations and practice.

English advanced and heard the Indians at their revels until midnight. The next morning (May 26) about break of day, after a march of three or four miles from the place where they halted the night before, they came within sight of the fort which was upon a hill. Wequash piloted them to the gate. The centinel happened just then to be gone into a wigwam to light his pipe. The Indians were all in a deep sleep. One of their dogs barking at the approach of the English caused a discovery. The Indians within the fort began their tremendous yell, and the In|dians without who were in the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear and afraid to come up seconded them. No sound that was ever made can be more horrid than the Indian yell. The English immediately fired into the fort, the palisadoes not being so close as to hinder the muzzles of their guns going be|tween. Not being able easily to enter at the gate, Mason went round to the other side of the fort, where was ano|ther opening or entrance barred with branches of forked trees only, at which he entred with those that were with him. His lieutenant and the rest of the English entred at the same time by other parts. The Indians who had no arms but bows, tomahawks and English hatchets made stout resistance at first and wounded many of the English. Mason intended to have spared the wigwams, but finding his men thus distressed he entred one of them and with a firebrand he found there set it on fire. While he was doing it an In|dian was drawing his bow and would undoubtedly have killed him if his serjeant coming in had not cut the bow|string with his hanger. The fire spread to the rest of the wigwams and the English all retreated without the fort and surrounded it. The Indians some climbed to the top of the palisadoes to avoid the fire and so exposed them|selves to the English bullets, others forced their way out of the fort and if any of them brake through the English the allied Indians were in a ring at some little distance, so that few if any escaped. There were about 60 or 70 wigwams in the fort or inclosure and it was imagined four or five hundred Pequods men women and children. Three

of the English were slain, and many both English and In|dians their friends wounded with arrows and some very badly. The army was in distress notwithstanding their victory. The morning was cold. They had no sort of refreshment not so much as water nor any shelter for their wounded. They had no intelligence of their vessels which had been ordered to come from Naraganset to Pe|quod river. Many Indians were in the woods who were not of the party in the fort. In the midst of this perplexity they espied their vessels at a distance, sailing towards them. They then took up their wounded upon mats fastened to poles, some with the heads of the arrows in their bodies, and marched to the vessels six miles through the woods and swamps, the Indians lying in wait at every con|venient place and with their arrows wounding many more; but many of the Indians were slain in their attempts upon the English. They put their wounded into one of the barks which set sail the same night and reached Saybrook fort. Patrick came in a pinnace from Providence to Nara|ganset soon after the forces marched, and with the other vessels went forward taking Myontinomo the sachem of Naraganset with them, but their arrival was prevented by contrary winds until the morning of the action, after it was over. Most of the English and all the Indians marched through what was called Nianticut's country, to Saybrook fort, their vessels also arriving there the next day. The Indians in alliance with the English had taken eighteen captives, ten males and eight females, four of the males were disposed of, one to each of four Sachems, the rest put to the sword. Four of the females were left at the fort, the other four carried to Connecticut, where the Indians challenged them as their prize, the English not agreeing to it they were sacrificed also to end the dispute. The policy as well as the morality of this proceeding may well be questioned. The Indians have ever shewn great barba|rity to their English captives, the English in too many in|stances have retaliated it. This has only enraged them the more. Besides, to destroy women and children for the bar|barity

<P>SASSACUS the Sachem, after the taking of Mistick fort and so many of his warriors being slain, broke down his own fort, burn'd all their wigwams, put his goods into canoes, and men women and children forsook their country and went a way by land to Quinnipiack. The forces un|der Capt. Stoughton arrived at Saybrook the latter end of June. They pursued the Indians, meeting now and then two or three at a time, whom they killed or took prisoners, at length they were informed of a great body of Indians in a swamp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hubbard says near Fairfield or Stratford.</NOTE> which they surrounded. They seem to have been of other tribes as well as Pequods. One of the Sa|chems came out with 99 men women and children, and delivered themselves up to the English. Wampum he said he had none, nor had he ever killed any English. The garment he had on, which was of black beaver skin, he pre|sented. An Indian was sent in to tell the rest that if they would come out and deliver up their arms and clear them|selves from having murdered any English they should fare the better. After a short parley they determined that as they had lived together they would die together. Twelve of the murtherers were among them. They were about eighty in all. The English fired upon them, and having surrounded the swamp all night entered in the morning, but found great part had escaped. Some of the Indians had guns and fired upon the English. This is the first account we have of their making use of guns. Sassacus fled to the Mohawks, by whom it was reported he was murdered. It is more probable that he and his company incorporated with them. Many of the captives were sent to Bermudas and sold for slaves. The Pequod tribe was wholly extinguished. The Naragansets took charge of some of them and promised to pay the English for their service; the few that remained never dared own they belonged to that tribe, but mixed with the Naraganset and other tribes. We have been more particular in relating this action, it being the first between the English and In|dians, many circumstances not having been published before,

<P>THIS year 1637 a number of the Puritan ministers in England wrote over to the ministers of New-England, in|forming them of reports that they had embraced new opinions which they disliked formerly and which they in England still judged to be groundless and unwarrantable, viz.
<Q>That a stinted form of prayer and set liturgy is un|lawful. That the children of godly and approved christians are not to be baptized until their parents be set members of some particular congregations. That the parents themselves though of approved piety are not to be received to the Lord's supper until they be admitted set members. That the power of excommunication is in the body of the church though the minister should be of another mind. That upon a minister's being dismissed though unjustly from his particular congregation he ceaseth to be a minister. That one minister cannot perform a ministerial act in any but his own congregation. That members of one congre|gation may not communicate in another.</Q>
They add,
<Q>that letters from New-England had influenced many in Old to leave their assemblies because of a stinted liturgy, and to absent themselves from the Lord's supper because such as ought to be were not debarred from it.</Q>
They therefore requested a seasonable review might be taken of the grounds and reasons that had swayed, and sent over, and if they were found to have weight they would be ready to give the right hand of fellowship, if otherwise they would ani|madvert upon them so far as they varied from the truth, &amp;c.

He had notwithstanding thoughts of returning to New-England, having an affection for the country, but death put an end to those thoughts. He died at London in March 1657. He left a legacy to Harvard College, which was unpaid until 1710, when it was received by virtue of a decree in chancery.</NOTE> two London merchants, Mr. Davenport a minister of great character for learning and piety, and many others of good note and condition were of this company. Great pains were taken to persuade them to stay in the jurisdiction. The court offered them any place they would pitch upon. The town of Newbury offered to give up their settlement to them. Quinnipiack and the country between that and the Dutch was represented as a very fruitful place and well situated for trade and navigation. They flattered themselves, but upon what grounds does not appear, that there they should be out of the reach of a general gover|nor, with which the country was from time to time threatned. These were the reasons publickly given for removing there. Besides, the principal men of the new company would be at the head of the government there; here, it was natural to expect, the old standers would be considered as their superiors.

<P>Their laws and judicial proceedings varied in very few circumstances from the Massachusets, one indeed was a material one, that they had no jury neither in civil nor criminal cases. All matters of fact as well as law were determined by the court.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport the minister who came over with Mr. Eaton had been a preacher of great note in Colman-street London, and for his non|compliance in ecclesiastical matters absconded and came over pri|vately. Many of his principal hearers accompanied him and formed a church at New-Haven. Another company came from Kent, Suffolk, and Surry in England, among whom was Mr. William Leet then a young man, after Mr. Eaton's death governor, and after the colonies were united some time governor of Connecticut. These with Mr. Whitfield their minister chose a place about 16 miles East of New-Haven, since called Guilford. Another company removed from Hartford with Mr. Peter Prudden for their minister, and settled a little West from New-Haven and called the place Milford. Brainford on the East and Stamford near forty miles West of New-Haven were both settled by people who removed from Weathers|field on account of disturbances in the church there. These towns together with a plantation upon the East end of Long-Island called Southold, are said to have been all that were concerned in the combination which was first formed. The colony chose their leader Mr. Eaton for their first governor and continued him every year until he died, which was 14 years after the foundation. Their chief view was trade, and to be better accommodated they built on small house-lots near the sea, and fairer and more com|modious, houses than those in the other colonies. They built vessels for foreign voyages, and set up trading houses upon lands which they purchased at Delaware bay for the sake of beaver, but were unsuccessful and their stocks sunk very fast, and in five or si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> years they were much exhausted. Unwilling to give over, they exerted themselves, as a last effort, in building a ship for the trade to England, in which they put their whole stock of money, plate and all the proper goods they could procure, to make a more va|luable adventure. In her went passenger Mr. Grigson one of the magistrates, in order to sollicit a patent, and 8 or 10 more consi|derable persons who, to use Mr. Cotton's expression, all went to heaven by water, the ship never being heard of after her sailing. The loss of this ship entirely broke them up as traders, and they turn|ed to husbandry for their support. The manner of their settlement upon small lots was inconvenient for husbandmen, and the soil was not the best, so that they were much discouraged and several projections were made for their removal in a body. They made further purchases of large tracts of land at Delaware bay, but were obstructed and discouraged by opposition from the Dutch. They had offers from Ireland after the wars were over, and were in treaty for the purchase of lands there for a small distinct province by themselves, and when Jamaica was conquered by Cromwell proposals were made to them to remove there in a body, but as the first generation went off and the second came on with the attachment natural to the place of their birth and education, they became more reconciled to their situation, and although they have never been remarkable for foreign commerce the first intention of the settlement, yet their improvements in husbandry have been equal to any of their neighbours. The ancient colony of New-Haven is at this day a principal part of the colony of Connecticut, on many accounts respectable, and to be placed with those of the first rank.</P></NOTE> The people in the

Massachusets soon after reflected upon the favor of provi|dence in not gratifying them with the continuance of this company among them. It appeared that the Dutch were de|signing to take possession of this country, and they opposed the English in the settlement even of New-Haven itself, threatning hostilities against them. Mr. Eaton being a man

of good abilities was a fit person to resist them, and finally in the year 1650 the other colonies uniting in the cause with New-Haven they were by treaty limited to Greenwich, said to be ten or twelve miles on a strait line distant from Hudson's river. Indeed the suffering them to extend thus far was mere favor and indulgence, but there had been a good correspondence always kept up between the English colonies and these intruders. They had mutual trade and commerce, and altho' the Dutch at that day, whatever they may now do, did not esteem godliness to be the greatest gain, yet their form of worship, their principles as to discipline and ceremonies were more agreeable to the New-Englan|ders than those of the high party in England. New-Haven was a barrier to the colony of Connecticut and

In a short time the archbishop and several other of the Lords of the council who were present at this order lost their authority and in|fluence. They were as much perplexed when called to ac|count for their own conduct as the colony could have been for theirs, had it been more exceptionable than it was. We may make some conjectures what would have been the consequence of taking away the charter at this time. It is pretty certain the body of the people would have left the country. Two years after meerly from a dissatisfaction with the soil and the climate, many did remove and many more were a tiptoe and restrained only by the consideration of their engagements to stand by and support one another; but where they would have removed is the question. It would not have been to the French. This would have been going further from the sun. They were too far northward already. Besides, they might well expect a heavier yoke under the romish hierarchy than what they com|plained of under the protestant. They would not have removed to any plantation or territory claimed by the King of England. What assurance could they have of security for the enjoyment of privileges in any other part stronger than they had when they came here? After they had spent their substance, and many that came with them their lives, in possessing and improving a country in confidence that they should enjoy their charter privileges, they and their posterity for ever, they would not have trusted to promises if any had been made them a second time. It is most likely they would have gone to the Dutch at Hudson's river. They had always kept up a friendly correspondence with them. In their religious principles and form of wor|ship and church government they were not very distant from one another. The Dutch were not generally very
<PB N="89" REF="009705_0049_0F7A457DB6508A80">
nice upon those points. The only difficulty would have been to have obtained those privileges in matters of go|vernment from the Dutch which they had from the Eng|lish. And I think the Dutch would have been politic enough to have granted them. If they had failed with the Dutch, such was their resolution that they would have sought a <HI>vacuum domicilium</HI> (a favorite expression with them) in some part of the globe where they would accord|ing to their apprehensions have been free from the con|troul of any European power. In their first migration most of them could say <HI>omnia mea mecum porto.</HI> All the difference as to the second would have been that so far as they had lessened their substance so much less room would have been necessary for the transportation of what remained. Such a scheme would have consisted very well with their notions of civil subjection as we shall see in many instances. I do not say their notions were just. Alle|giance in an English born subject is said to be perpetual and to accompany him wherever he goes.</P>
<P>THE same governor, deputy governor and assistants were chosen for 1638 as had been for 1637. The settle|ments were extended this year beyond Merrimack river. Salisbury and Hampton had great quantity of salt meadows. They were an inducement to people to sit down there although the upland was a light sandy soil and not very inviting. Rowley and Sudbury were both settled this year also.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Lynn being desirous of larger ac|commodations, many of them removed to Long Island, near the west end, Lord Sterling by his agent there having sold or quit claimed to them a tract for a plantation, but they were soon disturbed by the Dutch and some of them were imprisoned under a pretence of an affront offered to the Prince of Orange's arms which they had taken down from a tree wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re the Dutch had hung them up. Not being able to keep their ground they removed to the east end and settled a church and town (Southampton) and entred into a civil combination intending to be independent of any
<PB N="90" REF="009705_0050_0F7A457E95899490">
of the colonies. Another distinct government was form|ing at the mouth of Connecticut river by the agent of Lord Say and Seal and Lord Brooke, who with other per|sons of distinction were still expected in New England, and other companies who were intending to remove, intended likewise to form into separate governments. But this humour did not last long. In a few years all the colonies found an union or confederacy necessary for their defence not only against the Indians, but against the French and Dutch, and there could be no encouragement for small bodies of men to sit down any where independant or un|connected. All that had began any settlements between the Massachusets and the Dutch (the Rhode Islanders ex|cepted who were covered except on the sea by the other colonies) joined with Connecticut or New Haven, and all to the eastward whether in New Hampshire, Province of Main or the country further east, applied to the Massachu|sets that they might incorporate with them.</P>
<P>THE year 1638 was memorable for a very great earth|quake throughout New-England. The shake by the printed accounts of it and from manuscript letters appears to have been equal to that in 1727, the pewter in many places being thrown off the shelves, and the tops of chim|nies in some places shook down, but the noise though great not so surprizing as that of the last mentioned. The course of it was from West to East. This was a remark|able aera.

We hear but little of trade for the first seven years, except a small traffick with the na|tives by barter of toys, and the few utensils, tools and cloathing they at first thought necessary in exchange for furs and skins. What the planters brought with them consisted principally of materials for their buildings, neces|sary tools for their husbandry, stock for their farms and cloathing for themselves and families, and those who had more estate than was sufficient for these purposes were country gentlemen and unacquainted with commerce, as Winthrop, Dudley, Bellingham, Bradstreet, &amp;c. and never employed themselves in it (Mr. Winthrop built a small bark called the blessing, which was employed to import corn from the southern Indians when the colony was in want, but she was soon cast away) and people in general turned their minds to provide comfortable lodgings and to bring

under improvement so much land as would afford them necessary support, and this was enough to employ them. After a few years by hard labour and hard fare the land produced more than was consumed by the inhabitants, the overplus was sent abroad to the West-Indies, the Wine-Islands, &amp;c. Returns were made in the produce of the respective countries and in bullion, the most of which, to|gether with the furs procured from the natives, went to England to pay for the manufactures continually necessary from thence. As hands could be spared from husbandry and labor in providing their houses, they were taken off and some employed in sawing boards, splitting staves, shin|gles and hoops, others in the fishery, and as many as were capable of it in building small vessels for the fishery and for coasting and foreign trade. Thus gradually and insensibly they seem to have fallen into that trade most natural to the country and adapted to their peculiar circumstances, without any premeditated scheme or projection for that purpose. Their primary views in their removal were the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty. Merchants and others for the sake of gain when they saw a prospect of it afterwards came over and incorporated with them, and caused a great increase of commerce, and led the legislators to measures for the further improvement of it. For encouraging the fishery an act was made this year to free all estates employed in catching making or transporting fish, from all duties and publick taxes, and all persons were restrained by a penalty from using any cod or bass fish for manuring the ground; and all fishermen during the season for business, and all ship-builders were by the same act ex|cused from trainings. Sumptuary laws were made for restraining excess in apparel and other expences, a spirit of industry and frugality prevailed, and those who lived in the next age speak of this as the <HI>aurea aetas</HI> in which religion and virtue flourished: But it was not long before many became discontented and encouraged projects for their removal.</P>

As the inha|bitants multiplied the demand for the cattle increased, and the price of a milch cow had kept from 25 to 30 l. but fell at once this year to 5 or 6l. A farmer who could spare but one cow in a year out of his stock used to cloath his family with the price of it at the expence of the new comers; when this failed they were put to difficulties.

<P>LORD Say and Seal had turned his thoughts to a more southern settlement in the Bahama islands. He had en|gaged Mr. Humfries one of the assistants of the Massa|chusets colony in the design with a promise of being the governor of the new settlement. A new plan of govern|ment was framed wholly aristocratical and the magistracy to be hereditary, but exceptions being taken to this form by the people it was altered and brought nearer to that of the Massachusets.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is observable that all the colonies before the reign of King Charles the second, Maryland excepted, settled a model of government for themselves. Virginia had been many years distracted under the government of presidents and governors, with councils in whose nomination or removal the people had no voice until in the year 1620 a house of burgesses broke out in the colony, the King nor the grand council at home not having given any powers or directions for it.&mdash;The governor and assistants of the Massachusets at first intended to rule the people, and as we have observed ob|tained their consent for it, but this lasted two or three years only, and although there is no colour for it in the charter, yet a house of deputies appeared suddenly in 1634 to the surprize of the ma|gistrates and the disappointment of their schemes for power.&mdash;Connecticut soon after followed the plan of the Massachusets.&mdash;New Haven although the people had the highest reverence for their leaders and for near 30 years in judicial proceeding submitted to the magistracy (it must however be remembred that it was annu|ally elected) without a jury, yet in matters of legislation the peo|ple from the beginning would have their share by their represen|tatives.&mdash;New Hampshire combined together under the same form with Massachusets.&mdash;Lord Say tempts the principal men of the Massachusets to make them and their heirs nobles and absolute governors of a new colony, but under this plan they could find no people to follow them.&mdash;Barbados and the leward islands began in 1625, struggled under governors and councils and contending proprietors for about 20 years. Numbers suffered death by the arbitrary sentences of courts martial or other acts of violence as one side or the other happened to prevail. At length in 1645 the first assembly was called and no reason given but this, viz. that by the grant to the Earl of Carlisl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the inhabitants were to enjoy all the liberties, privileges and franchises of English subjects, and therefore, as it is also expresly mentioned in the grant, could not legally be bound or charged by any act without their own consent. This grant in 1627 was made by Charles the first, a Prince not the most tender of the sub|jects liberties. After the restoration there is no instance of a colo|ny settled without a representative of the people, nor any attempt to deprive the colonies of this privilege, except in the arbitary reign of King James the second. The colonies which are to be settled in the new acquired countries have the fullest assurance by his Majesty's proclamation that the same form of government shall be established there. Perhaps the same establishment in Canada and the full privileges of British subjects conferred upon the French inhabitants there might be the means of firmly at|taching them to the British interest, and civil liberty tend also to deliver them by degrees from their religious slavery. The inha|bitants of Acadie or Nova Scotia lived above forty years after the reduction of Port Royal under the government of their priests. No form of civil government was established and they had no more affection for England than for Russia. The military authority served as a watch to prevent confederacies or combi|nations. The people indeed chose more or less deputies from each canton or division, but their only business seems to have been to receive orders from the governor and to present petitions to him from the people. Temporal offences unless enormous and all civil controversies were ordinarily adjudged and determined by their spiritual fathers. I asked some of the most sensible of the Acadians what punishment the priests could inflict to answer the ends of government. They answered me by another question. What can be a greater punishment than the forfeiture of our sal|vation? In no part of the romish church the blind persuasion of the power of the priest to save or damn was ever more firmly riveted, and although these Acadians have for eight years past been scattered through the English colonies yet I never could hear of one apostate or so much as a wavering person among them all, and if the Canadians are treated in the same manner they will probably remain under the same infatuation.</NOTE> Mr. Winthrop the usual governor and

plant his people in, and that it would be displeasing unto him that this work should be hindered and that such as had been well inclined, if not with their persons yet with their substance, to encourage it should desist and discourage it by insinuating that there was no possibility of subsistance there; and added that God would never have sent so many of his people thither if he had not seen the place sufficient to maintain them or intended to make it so. His Lordship answered that he could not deny great part of what was written, particularly the evidence of God's owning his people in the country of New-England, but alledged that it was a place appointed for a present refuge only, and a better place being now found out they ought all to re|move there.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is certain that a great part of the colony was under great doubts as to their subsistance. All could not be traders. Much labor was necessary to the clearing a new country for pasture or tillage; after three or four years improve|ment of a piece of ground they found they had exhausted the goodness of the soil and were obliged to go upon new improvements. They never used such manure as would keep it in heart. The common practice of manuring with fish left the land in a worse state than it would have been in if they had used no manure at all, or than any other manure, even lime, would have left it. This caused many of them
<PB N="97" REF="009705_0053_0F7A45B31AF7A7F0">
to have an unfavorable opinion of the country and to de|spair of obtaining a livelihood in it, and great numbers had determined to remove. Some were persuaded to alter their resolution, but others persisted. A church had been gather|ed at Providence and news came that Mr. Sherwood the pastor with another minister had been sent home prisoners by Carter the deputy governor, and that the magistrates were inclined to persecution. This is not incredible even in the year 1641 when they could not have expected that these measures would be approved in England, for Virginia persisted in opposition to the parlia|ment many years after. Whilst some in New-England were discouraged by this advice others were the more con|firmed looking upon it their duty to go over and strengthen their brethren. Mr. Humfries had met with great losses by fire the year before and was detained in New-England by his private affairs for this year, but a company em|barked with Capt. William Peirce, who was of the first fleet which came over with the charter and a very noted commander. Upon their arrival at Providence they found the island in the possession of the Spaniards. They had shot in under the command of the fort before they disco|vered their danger, and in coming about Peirce was slain from the fort, but the vessel got clear and returned to New-England and the designs of the rest, of course, were at an end.

<P>THE difficulties particular persons were under and the difference of sentiment upon private affairs had an influence upon the publick affairs.

Mr. Endicot was chosen deputy governor. It was disputed whether they had the majority, and it was some time, Mr. Hubbard says, long, before either of them were ad|mitted to their places. The choice seems not to have

The colony went on exercising the powers of government until the restoration, when they applied by Mr. Winthrop their agent to King Charles II. in 1661 for a charter, which was granted in 1662, with as ample privileges as they could desire. Mr. Winthrop had been many years an assis|tant in the Massachusets. He was sensible of the defects in the charter, and besides, this colony being in America at the time of granting the charter, the powers granted them would naturally be better adapted to their circumstances.

Had these applications been delayed two or three years longer they would hardly have succeeded. Plimouth which had as much reason to expect such a favor never could obtain it.

<P>THE river of Newichewannock or Piscataqua is said to have been first discovered by Capt. Smith or some employ|ed by him in 1614 or 1615. DeMonts ten years before had been at Kennebeck and Saco and some leagues further westward along shore, but struck over from some part of Welles, by the description he gives of the coast, to Cape Ann, which he calls Cape Louis, and from thence to Cape Blanc, which must be Cape Cod. In the year 1623 seve|ral gentlemen merchants and others in the west of Eng|land belonging to Bristol, Exeter, Dorchester, Shrewsbury, Plimouth, &amp;c. having obtained patents from the council of Plimouth for several parts of New-England, and being encouraged by the plantation of New-Plimouth and the reports of fishermen who had made voyages upon the coast, projected and attempted a fishery about Piscataqua, and sent over David Thompson, together with Edward Hilton and William Hilton, who had been fishmongers in London, and some others, with all necessaries for their purpose. The Hiltons set up their stages some distance above the mouth of the river, at a place since called Dover. Some others of the company about the same time seized on a place below at the mouth of the river called Little Harbour, where they built the first house. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Capt. John Mason were of this company, and the place where this house was built with three or four thousand acres of land for a manor or lordship, by consent of the rest of the undertakers, was assigned to Capt. Mason, and the house took the name of Mason-hall.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Chimney and part of the stone wall were standing in the year 1680.</P>

The Lords Say and Brooke, who were very general adventu|rers, they purchased the Bristol men's share which was two thirds of the first company's interest. Some persons of Shrewsbury held the other third. Capt. Wiggan was made the agent for the Shrewsbury men. In the year 1630 Captain Neale with three others came over to Piscataqua to superintend the affairs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Mason, and the rest, but principally to discover a new country to which they gave the name of Laconia, and which in Gorges's history is very pompously described. Champlain many years before this had given his own name to Lake Iroquois, and the English, it may be, were informed by the Indians something of the geography of the country and of other lakes on the back of New-England, and no doubt the rumor was carried over to England. Neale spent three years in searching out his new country but could not find it and so returned. Nothing else memorable is

mentioned of Neale, except that he forbad Wiggan settling a point of land betwixt Dover and Exeter. Wig|gan went on and determined to defend his right by the sword. The other threatned as high, and from what might have happened, the disputed land took the name of Bloody Point, which it retains to this day. The Lords Say and Brooke also made Wiggan their agent for the term of seven years, during which time the interest was not greatly advanced, the whole being sold to him at the expiration of the term for six hundred pounds.</P>
<P>SOON after the year 1631 one Mr. Williams came over from England, sent also by Gorges and Mason to take care of their salt-works. Mr. Chadburne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Chadburne had the direction of the artificers who built what was called the great house at Strawberry bank. His posterity are settled on the other side the river in the province of Main.</NOTE> with several other planters and traders came over with him. These began the settlement of Strawberry bank (Portsmouth) and after Neale went away they are supposed either to have entered into an agrement and to have chosen Williams for their governor, who is said to have been a discreet sensible man and a gentleman, or else he was appointed by the company in England. There was a grant of a sum of money for building a parsonage house and a chapel, and for a glebe of 50 acres of land to be annexed, made by the inhabitants of Strawberry bank to Thomas Walford and Henry Sher|burn church wardens and their successors, &amp;c. and this was signed by Francis Williams governor, Ambrose Gibbons assistant, and 18 Inhabitants, dated May 25. 1640. Wil|liams soon after removed to Barbados. The first who enterprized the settlement of Piscataqua had some religious as well as civil views, and a puritan minister Mr. Leveridge a worthy man came over with Capt. Wiggan in 1633, but not being supported he removed to the southward and was succeeded by Mr. Burdet, who has not left so good a character. Not contented with his sacred function he invaded the civil government and thrust out Capt. Wig|gan and assumed the place of governor himself.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="009705_0058_0F7A45B6CDC05320">IN the mean time the Lords and others concerned had prevailed upon several persons of good estates and who made profession of religion, to transplant themselves and families to Piscataqua, so as to be able to make inhabitants enough for a considerable township, and having no charter commission or power of government from the crown, they were under necessity of entring into a combination or agree|ment among themselves, which was in the following form:</P>

<P>ABOUT the same time, viz. in 1638, Mr. Wheelwright the minister who had been banished from the Massachu|sets, with a number of persons who adhered to him, began a plantation on the south side of the great bay up Piscata|qua river, to which they gave the name of Exeter. They thought it necessary likewise to form themselves into a body politic, in order to enable them to carry on the affairs of their plantation. The instrument which they determined upon was of the following form:</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="009705_0058_0F7A45B6CDC05320">
<Q>WHEREAS it hath pleased the Lord to move the heart of our dread Sovereign Charles, &amp;c. to grant licence and liberty to sundry of his subjects to plant themselves in the western parts of America: We his loyal subjects members of the church of Exeter, situate and lying upon the river Piscataqua, with other inhabitants there, con|sidering with ourselves the holy will of God and our own necessity, that we should not live without wholsome laws and civil government amongst us, of which we are altoge|ther destitute, do in the name of Christ and in the sight of God combine ourselves together to erect and set up among us such government as shall be to our best discern|ing agreable to the will of God, professing ourselves subject to our Sovereign Lord King Charles according to the liberty of the English colony of the Massachusets, and binding ourselves solemnly by the grace and help of Christ and in his name and fear to submit ourselves to all such christian laws as are established in the realm of England, to our best knowledge, and to all other such laws which shall upon good grounds be made and enacted among us according to God, that we may live quietly and peaceably together in all godliness and honesty. October 4. 1639, John Wheelwright, William Wentworth, George Walton,</Q>
with 32 more. Captain Underhill an enthusiast who obtained his assurance, as he expressed himself before the church of Boston, while he was taking a pipe of the good creature tobacco,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard, &amp;c.</NOTE> and who was at the same time a very immoral man, and for adul|tery had been excommunicated, joined Mr. Wheel|wright's company and played his card so well that he ob|tained the place of governor over them, and also over the other company at Dover, they having quarrelled with Burdet the minister, who removed to York. There was a strong party against Underhill which caused great di|sturbance and confusion. At the same time they were as much divided in their ecclesiastical affairs. They at Do|ver had one Mr. Knolles for their minister, but Mr. Lark|ham
<PB N="108" REF="009705_0059_0F7A45B7886BB748">
arriving there from Northam near Barnstable in England, many people were taken with him and determined to dismiss Knolles, but his party stood by him and he and his company excommunicated Larkham. He in return laid violent hands on Knolles. The magistrates took part some on one side and some on the other, but Larkham's party being weakest sent to Williams the governor below for assistance, who came up with a company of armed men, beset Knolles's house, where Underhill the governor then was, called him to account, set a fine upon him and some others who had been concerned in the riot, and obliged them to remove from the plantation. Knolles was a rigid antinomian, his practice was agreable to his principles. He was charged with being too familiar with some of his female domesticks and found it necessary to depart. Lark|ham a zealous churchman soon followed him for an offence of the same nature.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have taken the principal facts relative to the settlement of Pisca|taqua from Hubbard's and other original antient manuscripts</NOTE> Thus we see three distinct colonies and independant governments formed upon Piscataqua river.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions the Massachusets people were enquiring into the bounds of their patent. In 1639 they sent persons to find out the northernmost part of Merrimack river. A line to run east from three miles north of the head of the river will take in the whole of New-Hampshire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bounds in the charter being three miles south of Charles river and all and every part thereof, and three miles north of Merri|mack and all and every part thereof, and all lands within the limits aforesaid in latitude and breadth, and in length and longitude, &amp;c. they supposed they had a right to stretch their line east from the head of Merrimack to the ocean.</NOTE> They determined therefore that it came within their jurisdiction, and from that time they allowed plantations to be settled, particularly at Hampton, as readily as in any other part of the colony, and exercised juris|diction over them, but they left those upon the river to their liberty, and it was their inability to preserve order among themselves which occasioned the application and submission which has already been mentioned. At their session in October the court passed the following order:</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="009705_0059_0F7A45B7886BB748">
<Q>WHEREAS it appeareth that by the extent of the line according to our patent the river of Piscataquack is within the jurisdiction of the Massachusets, and conference being had at several times with the said people and some deputed by the general court for the settling and establish|ing of order in the administration of justice there; it is now ordered by the general court holden at Boston this 9th day of the 8th month 1641, and with the consent of the inhabitants of the said river, as followeth. Imprimis, That from henceforth the said people inhabiting there are and shall be accepted and reputed under the govern|ment of the Massachusets as the rest of the inhabitants within the said jurisdiction are. Also that they shall have the same order and way of administration of justice and way of keeping courts as is established at Ipswich and Salem.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parts of the Massachusets nearest to Piscataqua.</NOTE> Also they shall be exempted from all publick charges other than those that shall arise for or from among themselves, or from any action or course that may be taken to procure their own good or benefit. Also they shall enjoy all such lawful liberties of fishing, plant|ing and felling timber as formerly they have enjoyed in the same river. Mr. Simon Broadstreet, Mr. Israel Stoughton, Mr. Samuel Simonds, Mr. William Tyng, Mr. Francis Williams, and Mr. Edward Hilton, or any four of them, whereof Mr. Broadstreet or Mr. Stoughton to be one, these shall have the same power that the quarter courts at Salem and Ipswich have. Also the inhabitants there are allowed to send two deputies from the whole river to the court at Boston. Also Mr. Broadstreet, Mr. Stoughton, and the rest of the com|missioners shall have power at the court at Piscataquack to appoint two or three to join with Mr. Williams and Mr. Hilton to govern the people as the magistrates do here till the next general court, or till the court take further order. It is further ordered, that until our com|missioners shall arrive at Piscataquack, those men who already have authority by the late combination to govern

the people there, shall continue in the same authority and power, to be determined at the coming of the said commissioners and not before.</Q>
Although nothing is said of Strawberry bank in the submission yet all the settlements seem to have concurred, and Williams the governor below was made one of the magistrates.</P>
<P>THE Massachusets by thus extending it's wing over the inhabitants of New-Hampshire nourished and cherished them for near 40 years, and to this must be attributed the growth and the present flourishing state of that colony. The principal inhabitants when the benefit was recent, in 1680 made a publick and grateful acknow|ledgment of it. Upon this construction of the charter the whole province of Main is taken into the Massachusets as well as New-Hampshire, but no application being made by the people there, nothing was done concerning them. Mr. Wheelwright and others who had been banished from the Massachusets soon after removed to the province of Main from New-Hampshire.</P>

Benjamin Woodbridge, the first-born of Harvard-College, was successor to Doctor Twisse at Newberry&punc; and though inclined to presbyterianism, to use Mr. Mather's words, not malignantly affected. George Downing went into the army and was scoutmaster general of the English army in Scotland. He was afterwards in great favor with Cromwell, who sent him am|bassador to the States, and upon the restoration he turned with the times and was sent or kept by the King in the same employ, had the merit of betraying, securing and sending over several of the regicides (he had been captain under one of them Col. Okey) was knighted and in favor at court and died in 1684. His cha|racter runs low with the best historians in England; it was much lower with his countrymen in New-England, and it became a proverbial expression to say of a false man who betrayed his trust that he was an arrant George Downing. Oliver Cromwell when he sent him agent or ambassador to the States in his letter of cre|dence says
<Q>George Downing is a person of eminent quality, and after a long trial of his fidelity, probity and diligence in several and various negotiations, well approved and valued by us. Him we have thought sitting to send to your Lordships dignified with the character of our agent,</Q>
&amp;c. (Milton's letters.) In his latter days he is said to have been very friendly to New-England and when the colony was upon the worst terms with King Charles the second. An article of news from England in 1671 says
<Q>Sir George Down|ing is in the tower, it is said because he returned from Holland where he was sent ambassador before his time: As it is reported he had no small abuse offered him there.

Connecticut proposed to fall upon the Indians immediately, and offered if the Massachusets would send 120 men to Saybrook to join a proportionable number. But the Massachusets court doubted whether they had sufficient proofs of the designs of the Indians to justify a war. However the governor with the magistrates before the court met thought it ne|cessary to disarm the Indians within the colony, which they readily submitted to. Miantinomo came in person to the court and demanded that his accusers should be brought face to face, and if they failed in their proof that they should suffer the same punishment he would have deserved himself if he had been guilty, viz. death. His behaviour was grave and he gave his answers with great deliberation and seeming ingenuity. He would never speak but in the presence of two of his counsellors that they might be witnesses of every thing which passed. Two days were spent in treaty. He denied all he was charged with, and pretended the reports to his disadvantage were raised by Uncas sachem of the Mohegins or some of his people. He was willing to renew his former engagements that if any of the Indians, even the Nianticks, who he said were as his own flesh and blood, should do any wrong to the Eng|lish so as neither he nor they could satisfy without blood, he would deliver them up and leave them to mercy.

<P>A new sect, springing from the ashes of the antinomians, made great disturbance about this time. Samuel Gorton a citizen of London who came to Boston in 1636 was at the head of it. Mr. Cotton says<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bloody Tenet washed, &amp;c. p. 5 &amp; 8.</NOTE> his principles were the very dregs of familism. It is certain that he was artful enough to explain them in such manner that his judges in the Massachusets were divided in opinion whether they were heretical or not. He staid not long

There he treated the court with contempt, and by order of the governor, Mr. Coddington, was first im|prisoned and afterwards whipped. From Rhode-Island he went to Providence, where Roger Williams with his usual humanity, although he disliked his principles and behavior, gave him shelter. Here he found several of his own dis|position, fond of novelties in religion, and they first sat down at Patuxet near Providence, but some of the inha|bitants there applied to the Massachusets that they and their lands might be received into protection, and com|plained that Gorton and his company, under pretence of purchase from the Indians, were going about to deprive them of their estates, of which for several years they had been in the lawful possession. The governor and three of the assistants signed what was called a warrant or notifi|cation to all the people of Providence requiring them to submit to the jurisdiction of the Massachusets. This was dated in October 1642. Gorton sent a very contemptu|ous answer and told them they had no authority over the people of Providence. But either for the sake of being more out of the reach of the Massachusets, or from discord among themselves, Gorton and 11 more purchased of Miantinomo the Naraganset sachem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Pumham a petty Sachem who lived upon the lands joined in the Sale but alledged that he had no consideration for it.</P>

<P>MIANTINOMO was likewise sent for to Boston but did not make out his right to the Indian country to the satisfaction of the court. It does not appear that he relin|quished it, and Gorton says in his defence that Pomham and Sachonoco were the natural subjects of Miantinomo and influenced by the Massachusets to withdraw from him. He being the greatest and most powerful Sachem in New-England it is probable that these were dependants upon him or tributaries to him. Be that as it may, the Massachusets sent a message to Gorton and his company acquainting them that they were still within their jurisdiction by virtue of the submission of Pomham and Sachonoco, and requiring them to appear at the court at Boston to answer to com|plaints against them for injuries done to the Indians, &amp;c. and promising them safe conduct, &amp;c. This was dated the 12th of the 7th month 1643. They sent back by the messenger a verbal answer that they were out of the

Mr. Winslow in his answer will not allow this to be true. This Mr. Ward was author of The Simple Cobler of Agawam and several other witty performances. The ruling passion would frequently shew itself in instances which would have been liable to some exception in those days of great gravity, if his principles had not been orthodox and his general behavior seri|ous and guarded. Many of his witty facetious terms are handed down to posterity. A letter of his I find among Mr. Cotton's papers discovers something of his cast of mind.</P>

<P>I was yesterday convented before the bishop, I mean to his court, and am adjourned to the next term. I see such giants turn their backs that I dare not trust my own weak heart. I expect measure hard enough and must furnish apace with proportionable armour. I lacke a friend to help buckle it on. I know none but Christ himself in all our coast fitt to help me, and my acquain|tance with him is hardly enough to hope for that assistance my weak spirit will want and the assaults of tentation call for. I pray therefore forget me not and believe for me also if there be such a piece of neighbourhood among Christans. And so bles|sing God with my whole heart for my knowledge of you and immerited interest in you, and thanking you entirely for that faithful love I have found from you in many expressions of the best nature, I commit you to the unchangeable love of God our Father in his son Jesus Christ in whom I hope to rest for ever.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE> Being brought before the court the charge exhibited against them was in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>UPON much examination and serious consideration of your writings with your answers about them we do charge you to be a blasphemous enemy of the true religion of
<PB N="121" REF="009705_0065_0F7A45BCC62F2910">
our Lord Jesus Christ and his holy ordinances and also of civil authority among the people of God, and par|ticularly in this jurisdiction.</Q></P>
<P>THEIR writings were produced in evidence against them, and they explained them in such a manner that the governor Mr. Winthrop said he could agree with them in their answer though he could not in their writings, but Mr. Dudley stood up much moved and said he would never consent to it while he lived that they were one with them in those answers. The governor then asked Gorton what faith was; he answered in the words of the apostle that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen; the governor told him that was true but he could say more of faith than that. He desired to be excused, and Mr. Bradstreet prudently enough excepted to such questions unless he was free to speak to them, and thereupon they were dismissed and remanded to prison.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gorton.</NOTE> Their sentences were cruel. Gorton ordered to be con|fined to Charlestown there to be kept at work and to wear such bolts and irons as might hinder his escape, and if he broke his confinement or by speech or writing pub|lished or maintained any of the blasphemous abominable heresies wherewith he had been charged by the general court, or should reproach or reprove the churches of our Lord Jesus Christ in these united colonies or the civil government, &amp;c. that upon conviction thereof upon trial

by a jury he should suffer death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gorton says they cast a lot for their lives putting it to the major vote of the court whether they should live or die, and that God in his providence ordered it by a majority of two votes only in favor of their lives.</NOTE> The rest were confined to different towns, one in a town, and upon the same condi|tions with Gorton; their cattle were seized and ordered to be sold and the charge of fetching them and the expence at|tending the trial and imprisonment to be paid out of the pro|ceeds, and the overplu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be reserved for their future main|tenance during their confinement.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><P>After being confined one winter they were banished the juris|diction and from the lands purchased of the Indians upon pain of death. Gorton soon after went to England and obtained an order from the governor in chief, the lord high admiral and com|missioners appointed by the parliament for the English plantations in America, directed to the governor and assistants of the Massa|chusets and to all other governors and other inhabitants of New-England and all others whom it may concern, requiring them to suffer Gorton and the rest quietly to enjoy their lands in Naraganset bay and to land at any port in New-England in their way thither, &amp;c. This order was sent to the governor by Randall Holden one of Gorton's adherents, who with others arrived at Boston 13th Sept. 1646. Having desired leave to land, the go|vernor Mr. Winthrop answered that he could not give them leave by his own authority, as it would dispense with an order of the general court, but the council being to meet in two or three days he would impart the order and intimated that he should not trouble himself about them in the mean time. The council were not all of a mind, but the majority agreed to suffer them to pass quietly for the present, and that when the court met, further con|sideration should be had of their possessing the land they claimed. The court thought proper to send Mr. Edward Winslow to Eng|land in order to give satisfaction to the commissioners for planta|tions. He carried with him a remonstrance and petition against Gorton and in vindication of the colony, asserted their right by charter finally to determine all causes without admitting of ap|peals to England, and alledged that the lands lay in Plimouth colony and produced an act of the commissioners of the four co|lonies, of which Plimouth was one, impowering the Massachusets to proceed as they thought proper. The commissioners for plan|tations in their answer say <Q>they intended not to encourage any appeals from their justice, which it might be very inconvenient to admit, nor to restrain the bounds of their jurisdiction to a nar|rower compass, but they supposed the Naraganset bay (the thing in question) was without the bounds of their patent, but as they had received advertisement that the place was within the patent of New-Plimouth, and the ground of their proceedings was a joint authority from the four governments of Massachusets, Pli|mouth, Connecticut and New-Haven, if these things should be proved it would much alter the state of the question, but at that distance these points could not be settled and must be left to be determined upon the place if there should be occasion, for there the boundaries would be best known, and if it should appear that the said tract was within any of the New-England patents they should leave the same and the inhabitants thereof to the jurisdic|tion of that government under which they fell; nevertheless in|asmuch as the petitioners had transplanted their families thither and settled at great charge they commend it to the government within whose jurisdiction they shall appear to be, not only not to remove them from the plantations but also to encourage them with protection and assistance and in all fit ways whilst they should demean themselves peaceably, &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P>Gorton came again to Boston in the spring of 1648. The court upon his arrival ordered that he should be apprehended, but producing a letter from the Earl of Warwick desiring that he might have li|berty to return home, the court recalled the order and gave him a week's liberty to provide for his departure.</P>
<P>After this time the Gortonists considered how to make their peace, and making their application in sober language they remained unmolested and quietly enjoyed their possessions at Showamet, to which in honor to their patron and benefactor they gave the name of Warwick which it retains to this day, and the posterity of several of them are persons of reputation and esteem in that colony</P>
<P>Gorton published an account of his sufferings. Mr. Winslow the agent for the Massachusets answered him. In 1665 he preferred his petition to the commissioners sent over by King Charles the second for recompence for the wrongs done him by the Massachu|sets, alledging that besides his other sufferings he and his friends had 80 head of cattle taken and sold. The Massachusets in their answer charge him with heretical tenets both in religion and civil government and with an unjust possession of the Indian lands in the vicinity of the colonies for the sake of disturbing their peace, and add that the goods which they seized did not amount to the charge of their prosecution, but they do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> sufficiently vindicate their seizing their persons or goods without the limits of their jurisdiction, and conclude with hoping that his Majesty will excuse any circumstantial error in their proceeding, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> As all who have pub|lished

<P>THE dangers to which the colonies in New-England were exposed from domestic and foreign enemies first in|duced them to think of an alliance and confederacy for their mutual defence and safety. Those of Aquidnick or Rhode Island were willing enough to have joined with the rest but the Massachusets refused to admit commissioners from that colony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o treat with the commissioners from the rest upon the terms of the agrement. The other four settled articles of confederation May 19, 1643. They have been published at large by Doctor Mather, Mr. Neale, &amp;c. and are in substance as follows,&mdash;</P>
<P>THE united colonies of New-England, viz. Massachu|sets, Plimouth, Connecticut and New-Haven enter into a firm and perpetual league offensive and defensive.</P>
<P>EACH colony to retain a distinct and separate jurisdic|tion, no two colonies to join in one jurisdiction without the consent of the whole, and no other colony to be received into the confederacy without the like consent.</P>
<P>THE charge of all wars offensive or defensive to be borne in proportion to the male inhabitants between 16 and 60 years of age in each colony.</P>
<P>UPON notice from three magistrates of any colony of an invasion the rest shall immediately send aid, the Massachusets 100 and each of the other 45 men, and if a greater number be necessary the commissioners to meet and determine upon it.</P>
<P>TWO commissioners from each government, being church members, to meet annually the first monday in September, the first meeting to be held at Boston, then at Hartford, New-Haven and Plimouth, and so yearly in that order, saving that two meetings successively be held at Boston.</P>
<P>ALL matters wherein six shall agree to be binding upon the whole, and if there be a majority, but under six, the matter in question to be referred to the general court of each colony and not to be obligatory unless the whole agree to it.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="009705_0067_0F7A45C0806D6FA0">A president for preserving order, to be chosen by the commissioners each year out of their number.</P>
<P>THE commissioners shall have power to establish laws or rules of a civil nature and of general concern for the con|duct of the inhabitants, viz. relative to their behavior to|wards the Indians, to fugitives from one colony to another, and the like.</P>
<P>NO colony to engage in war, except upon a sudden exi|gency, and in that case to be avoided as much as possible, without the consent of the whole.</P>
<P>IF a meeting be summoned upon any extraordinary oc|casion and the whole number of commissioners do not as|semble, any four who shall meet may determine upon a war when the case will not admit of delay, and send for the agreed proportion of men out of each jurisdiction, but not less than six shall determine the justice of the war, or have power to settle bills of charges or make levies for the same.</P>
<P>IF any colony break any article of the agrement or any ways injure another colony, the matter shall be considered and determined by the commissioners of the other colonies.</P>
<P>THESE articles were ratified by Massachusets, Connec|ticut and New-Haven, May 19, 1643. Plimouth com|missioners had not then full powers, but they acceded at the first meeting for business September 7th following.</P>
<P>THIS confederacy had been in agitation for several years. In 1638 articles were drawn up which were re|ferred until 1639. Mr. Haynes and Mr. Hooker from Connecticut tarried several weeks in the Massachusets sol|liciting it. They had reason to expect trouble from the Dutch who kept a trading house at Hartford, after that place was under the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and broils frequently happened there, and the Dutch at Manhadoes were ready to have taken advantage of the least breach or alienation between the colonies; but by reason of several obstructions from time to time nothing could be perfected until 1643, when commissioners came from all the several colonies to Boston whilst the general court was sitting, viz.
<PB N="126" REF="009705_0068_0F7A45C18F851178">
Mr. Haynes and Mr. Hopkins from Hartford, Mr. Eato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Mr. Grigson from New-Haven, besides Mr. Fenwick the governor of Saybrook fort, Mr. Winslow and Mr. Col|lier from Plimouth. The Massachusets appointed Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Dudley and Mr. Bradstreet of the magis|trates, Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Tyng of the deputies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This union subsisted, with some alterations, until the year 1686, when all the charters were in effect vacated by a commission from King James the 2d. For many years, commissioners met annually in September and occasionally at other times. In the latter part of the union the meetings were triennial. A special and princi|pal part of their business after the first years was the care of gos|pelizing the Indians. The society established by the parliament for propagating the gospel in New-England among the Indians, of which we shall hereafter take further notice, made the com|missioners their correspondents and agents for dispensing the charitable donations, and after the grant of a new charter by King Charles the second the same powers and trust were continued. A particular account of all their proceedings in this capacity is preserved in their records. This confederacy was acknowledged and countenanced by the authority in England from its beginning until the restoration, and in letters from King Charles the second notice is taken of it without any exception to the establishment.</P>
<P>July 23, 1643, a vessel of about 100 tons belonging to the Earl of Warwick arrived at Boston from Trinidada in order to transport passengers to people the island, but none could be prevailed upon to remove. One Chaddock son to the governor of Bermudas was commander of this ship. He was a loose profligate man and had a crew like himself. Five or six of them were blown up by two barrels of powder taking fire in the pinnace where they were, near the castle. Some time after strange sights were seen about the castle and at governor's island, in form like a man casting out flame and sparks of fire, and a voice was heard in several parts of the harbour crying boy boy come away come away, of all which divers sober persons were eye and ear witnesses, and these sights and noises were supposed to have a special reference to the place where the pinnace was blown up One of the men it was said had been acquainted with the black art.</P>

This turn of mind was not peculiar at this time to the people of New-England. It was prevalent in England. If the New-Englanders exceeded, the new scenes they had just entred upon, may in some measure account for it. They had an ocean a thousand leagues in extent between them and all the de|lights of life which they had once enjoyed. On their backs they had a wilderness without limits. Assoon as it was dark their ears were filled with the roaring of wolves and other savage beasts, or which was much worse the yells of savage men.

<P><PB N="127" REF="009705_0068_0F7A45C18F851178">ABOUT this time much division and disturbance in the colony was occasioned by the French of Acadie and Nova Scotia.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1644.</NOTE> It is necessary to look back upon the state of those countries.

King Charles in 1625 confirmed Alexander's grant under whom La Tour settled.</NOTE> and that he obtained also a grant of a baronettage of Nova Scotia.

<P>In 1632 La Tour obtained from the French King a grant of the river and bay of St. Croix and islands and lands adjacent, twelve leagues upon the sea and twenty leagues into the land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French commissaries speak of this grant as made to Razilly.</NOTE> By the treaty of St. Germains the same year Acadie was relinquished by the English and La Tour became dependant upon the French alone. In 1634 he obtained a grant of the Isle of Sables, another of ten leagues upon the sea and ten into the land at La Have, another of Port Royal the same extent, and the like at Menis with all adjacent islands included in each grant. Razilly had the general command, who appointed Monsieur D'Aulney de Charnisy his Lieutenant of that part of Acadie west of St. Croix, and La Tour of that east. In consequence of this division D'Aulney came as has been related and dispossessed the English at Penobscot in the year 1635. Razilly died soon after and D'Aulney and La Tour both claimed a general command of Acadie and made war upon one ano|ther. D'Aulney, by the French King's letter to him in 1638, was ordered to confine himself to the coast of the Etechemins which in all his writings he makes to be a part of Acadie. La Tour's principal fort was at St. John's. As their chief views were the trade with the natives, being so near together, there was a constant clashing of interest. In November 1641 La Tour sent Rochet, a protestant of Rochel, to Boston from St. John's with proposals for a free trade between the two colonies and desiring assistance against D'Aulney, but not having sufficient credentials the governor and council declined any treaty and he returned. The next year October 6, there came to Boston a shallop from La Tour with his Lieutenant and 14 men, with letters
<PB N="129" REF="009705_0069_0F7A45C211841D98">
full of complement, desiring aid to remove D'Aulney from Penobscot, and renewing the proposal of a free trade. They returned without any assurance of what was princi|pally desired, but some merchants of Boston sent a pinnace after them to trade with La Tour at the river St. John. They met with good encouragement and brought letters to the governor containing a large state of the controversy between D'Aulney and La Tour, but stopping at Pemaquid in their way home they found D'Aulney upon a visit there, who wrote to the governor and sent him a printed copy of an arr&ecirc;t he had obtained from France against La Tour, and threatned that if any vessels came to La Tour he would make prize of them. The next summer (June 12) La Tour himself came to Boston in a ship with 140 persons aboard, the master and crew being protestants of Rochel. They took a pilot out of a Boston vessel at sea, and com|ing into the harbour saw a boat with Mr. Gibbon's lady and family who were going to his farm. One of the Frenchmen who had been entertained at the house knew her, and a boat being manned to invite her aboard, she fled to Governor's Island and the Frenchmen after her, where they found the governor and his family, who were all greatly surprized, as was the whole colony when they heard the news,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town was so surprized that they were all immediately in arms and three shallops filled with armed men were sent to guard the governor home.</NOTE> for had it been an enemy he might not only have secured the governor's person but taken possession of the castle opposite to the island, there not being a single man at that time to defend the place.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>This occasioned new regulations for the better security of the place.

La Tour had cleared up his conduct so as to obtain a permission under the hands of the Vice Admiral and Grand Prior, &amp;c. for this ship to bring supplies to him,
<PB N="130" REF="009705_0070_0F7A45C2C1031438">
and in the permission he was stiled the King's Lt. General in Acadie. He produced also letters from the agent of the company in France advising him to look to himself and to guard against the designs of D'Aulney. The gover|nor called together such of the magistrates and deputies as were near the town and laid before them La Tour's request. They could not, consistent with the articles they had just agreed to with the other governments, grant aid without their advice, but they did not think it necessary to hinder any who were willing to be hired from aiding him which he took very thankfully, but some being dis|pleased with these concessions the governor called a second meeting where, upon a more full debate, the first opinion was adhered to.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some of the magistrates, deputies and elders were much grieved at this proceeding. A remonstrance to the governor was drawn up and signed by Mr. Saltonstall, Mr. Bradstreet, and Mr. Sy|monds of the magistrates, and Mr. Nath. Ward, Ezekiel Rogers, Nathanael Rogers and John Norton of the elders, wherein they condemn the proceeding as impolitic and unjust, and set forth
<Q>that they should expose their trade to the ravages of D'Aulney and perhaps the whole colony to the resentment of the French King, who would not be imposed upon by the distinction of per|mitting and commanding force to assist La Tour; that they had no sufficient evidence of the justice of his cause&punc; and <HI>in causa dubi&acirc; bellum non est suscipiendum,</HI> that La Tour was a papist attended by priests, friars, &amp;c. and that they were in the case of Jehoshaphat who joined with Ahab an idolater, which act was expressly con|demned in scripture,</Q></P>
<BIBL>Manuscript letters and original papers&punc;</BIBL></NOTE> La Tour hired four ships of force and took 70 or 80 volunteers into his pay, with which assistance he was safely landed at his fort, and D'Aulney fled to Penob|scot where he ran his vessels ashore, and although the com|mander of the ships refused to attack him, yet some of the soldiers joined with La Tour's men in an assault upon some of D'Aulney's men who had intrenched themselves but were obliged to betake themselves to flight having three of their number slain. The ships returned in about two months without any loss. The governor excused the proceeding to D'Aulney as not having interested himself in the quarrel between them, but only permitted La Tour in his distress as the laws of christianity and humanity re|quired,
<PB N="131" REF="009705_0070_0F7A45C2C1031438">
to hire ships and men for his money without any commission or authority derived from the government of the colony. D'Aulney went to France and being expec|ted to return the next summer 1644 with a great force, La Tour came again to Boston and went from thence to Mr. Endicot who was then governor and lived at Salem and who appointed a meeting of magistrates and ministers to consider his request. Most of the magistrates were of opinion that he ought to be relieved as a distressed neigh|bour, and in point of prudence to prevent so dangerous an enemy as D'Aulney from strengthening himself in their neighbourhood; but it was finally agreed that a letter should be wrote to D'Aulney to enquire the reason of his having granted commissions to take their people, and to demand satisfaction for the wrong he had done to them and their confederates, in taking Penobscot, and in making prize of their men and goods at the Isle of Sables, at the same time intimating that altho' these people who went the last year with La Tour had no commission yet if D'Aulney could make it appear they had done him any wrong (which they knew nothing of) satisfaction should be made, and they expected he should call in all his commissions and re|quired his answer by the bearer. They likewise acquaint|ed him that their merchants had entred into a trade with La Tour which they were resolved to support them in. La Tour being able to obtain nothing further returned to his fort.</P>
<P>SOME of the province of Maine going this summer (1644) from Saco to trade with La Tour or to get in their debts put in at Penobscot in their way and were detained prisoners a few days, but for the sake of Mr. Shurt of Pemaquid one of the company, who was well known to D'Aulney, they were released. La Tour afterwards pre|vailed upon Mr. Wanneston another of the company to attempt with about twenty of La Tour's men to take Penobscot, for they heard the fort was weakly manned and in want of victuals. They went first to a farm house of D'Aulney's about six miles from the fort. They burned
<PB N="132" REF="009705_0071_0F7A45C37713C6F8">
the house and killed the cattle, but Wanneston being killed at the door the rest of them came to Boston.</P>
<P>IN September letters were received from D'Aulney in|forming that his master the King of France understanding that the aid allowed to La Tour the last year by the Massachusets was procured by means of a commission which he shewed from the Vice-Admiral of France, had given in charge that they should not be molested but good corre|spondence should be kept with them and all the English, and that, assoon as he had settled some affairs, he intended to let them know what further commission he had, &amp;c. Soon after, he sent a commissioner supposed to be a friar, but dressed in lay habit, with ten men to attend him, with credentials and a commission under the great seal of France, and copy of some late proceedings against La Tour who was proscribed as a rebel and traitor, having fled out of France against special order. The governor and magistrates urged much a reconciliation with La Tour, but to no purpose. La Tour pretended to be a Huguenot&punc; or at least to think favorably of that religion, and this gave him a preference, in the esteem of the colony, to D'Aul|ney, but as D'Aulney seemed to be established in his au|thority, upon proposals being made by him of peace and friendship, the following articles were concluded upon, viz.
<LETTER>
<HEAD><Q>THE agreement between John Endicot, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> governor of New-England and the rest of the magistrates there, and Monsieur Marie commissioner of Monsieur D'Aulney, Knt. governor and lieut. general for his Majesty the King of France in Acadie a province of New France, made and ratified at Boston in the Massachusets aforesaid, October 8. 1644.</Q></HEAD>
<P><Q>THE Governor and all the rest of the magistrates do promise to Mr. Marie that they and all the rest of the English within the jurisdiction of the Massachusets shall observe and keep firm peace with Mons. D'Aulney &amp;c. and all the French under his command in Acadie. And likewise the said M. Marie doth promise in the behalf of Mons. D'Aulney, that he and all his people shall
<PB N="133" REF="009705_0071_0F7A45C37713C6F8">
also keep firm peace with the governor and magistrates aforesaid, and with all the inhabitants of the jurisdiction of the Massachusets aforesaid, and that it shall be lawful for all men both the French and English to trade with each other, so that if any occasion of offence should happen neither part shall attempt any thing against the other in any hostile manner, until the wrong be first de|clared and complained of and due satisfaction not given. Provided always the governor and magistrates aforesaid be not bound to restrain their merchants from trading with their ships with any persons whether French or others wheresoever they dwell. Provided also that the full ratification and conclusion of this agreement be referred to the next meeting of the commissioners of the united colonies of New-England for the continuation or abroga|tion, and in the mean time to remain firm and inviolable.</Q></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>THIS agreement freed the people from the fears they were under of ravages upon their small vessels and out plantations. La Tour was suffered to hire a vessel to carry a supply of provisions to his fort, which vessel he took under his convoy and returned home.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The agreement made with D'Aulney was afterwards ratified by the commissioners of the united colonies, but he proved a very trouble|some neighbour notwithstanding. In 1645 he made prize of a vessel belonging to the merchants of Boston going to La Tour with provisions and sent the men home, after he had stripped them of their cloaths and kept them ten days upon an island, in a small old boat without either compass to steer by or gun to de|fend themselves. The governor and council dispatched away a vessel with letters to expostulate with him upon this action, com|plaining of it as a breach of the articles and requiring satisfaction, but he wrote back in very high and lofty language and threatned them with the effects of his master's displeasure. They replied to D'Aulney that they were not afraid of any thing he could do to them, and as for his master they knew he was a mighty prince, but they hoped he was just as well as mighty, and that he would not fall upon them without hearing their cause, and if he should do it they had a God in whom to trust when all other help failed. With this ship D'Aulney made an attempt the same year upon La Tour's fort while he was absent, having left only 50 men in it, but his lady bravely defended it, and D'Aulney returned disappointed, and charged the Massachusets with breach of cove|nant in entertaining La Tour and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ending home his lady. They excused themselves in a letter by replying that La Tour had hired three London ships which lay in the harbour. To this letter D'Aul|ney refused at first to return any answer, and refused to suffer the messenger, Capt. Allen, to come within his sort, but at length wrote in a high strain demanding satisfaction for his mill which had been burnt, and threatning revenge. When the commis|sioners met in September they agreed to send Capt. Bridges to him with the articles of peace ratified by them, and demanding a rati|fication from him under his own hand. D'Aulney entertained their messenger with courtesy and all the state he could, but re|fused to sign the articles until the differences between them were composed, and wrote back that he perceived their drift was to gain time, whereas if their messengers had been furnished with power to have treated with him and concluded about their diffe|rences he doubted not all might have been composed, for he stood more upon his hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r than his interest, and he would sit still until the spring expecting their answer. The general court, upon con|sidering this answer, resolved to send the deputy governor Mr. Dud|ley, Major Denison and Capt. Hawthorn with full powers to treat and determine, and wrote to D'Aulney acquainting him with their resolution, and that they had agreed to the place he desired, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iz. Penobscot or Pentagoet, and referred the time to him, pro|vided it should be in the month of September. This was opposed by some as too great a condescension, and they would have had him come to the English settlement at Pemaquid, but his commission of lieutenant-general for the King of France was thought by othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to carry so much dignity with it that it would be no dis|honor to the colony to go to his own house; but it seems he was too good a husband to put himself to the expence of entertaining the messengers, and wrote in answer that he perceived they were now in earnest and desired peace, as he did also for his part, and that he thought himself highly honored by their vote to send so many of their principal men to him, but desired he might spare them the labor and he would send two or three of his to Boston in Au|gust following (1646) to hear and determine, &amp;c. On the 20th of September Messirs. Marie, Lewis, and D'Aulney's secretary ar|rived at Boston in a small pinnace, and it being Lord's day two officers were sent to receive them at the water side and to conduct them to their lodgings without any noise, and after the public worship was over the governor sent Major Gibbons with other gentlemen and a guard of musketeers to attend them to his house where they were entertained. The next morning they began upon business, and every day dined in public, and were conducted morning and evening to and from the place of treaty with great ceremony. Great injuries were alledged on both sides and after several days spent an amnesty was agreed upon. One Capt. Crom|well had taken in the West Indies a rich sedan made for the Vice Roy of Mexico which he gave to Mr. Winthrop: This was sent as a present to D'Aulney, and well accepted by his commissioners, the treaty renewed, and all matters amicably settled. In the mean time D'Aulney effectually answer'd his main purpose, for by his high language he kept the colony from assisting La Tour, took his fort from him with ten thousand pounds sterling in furs and other merchandize, ordnance stores, plate, jewels, &amp;c. to the great loss of the Massachusets merchants, to one only of whom (Major Gibbons) La Tour was indebted &pound;. 2500 which was whol|ly lost. La Tour went to Newfoundland where he hoped to be aided by Sir David Kirk, but was disappointed, and came from thence to Boston where he prevailed upon some merchants to send him with four or five hundred pounds sterling in goods to trade with the Indians in the bay of fundy. He dismissed the English who were sent in the vessel and never thought proper to return himself or render any account of his consignments. D'Aulney died before the year 1652 and La Tour married his widow, and repossessed himself in whole or in part of his former estate in Nova Scotia, and in 1691 a daughter of D'Aulney and a canoness at St. Omers dying, made her brothers and sisters La Tours her general legatees. Under them, and by force of divers confirmations of for|mer grants made by Lewis the 14th, between the peace of Rys|wick and that of Utrecht, D'Entremont aforementioned claimed a great part of the province of Nova Scotia and of the country of Acadie. Of part of those in Nova Scotia he was possessed when all the French inhabitants were removed by order of admiral Boscawen and general Lawrence.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Indians this year were at war among themselves. Miantinomo the great Sachem of Naraganset, not being able to unite them all against the English, shewed his resent|ment against Uncas Sachem of the Mohegins and the two petty Sachems, Pomham and Sachonoco, near Providence; but in an action between the Naragansets and Mohegins

<P>THE commissioners of the united colonies interposed between the Naragansets and Mohegins, and by messengers recommended peace to both of them, offering as mediators and umpires to settle and determin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their differences. Yoncho Sachem of Munhanset on Long-Island came to the commissioners at Hartford and desired that he and his people might be preserved from all injuries, professing himself a friend both to the English and Dutch, having been a tributary to the former ever since the Pequod war, and he and his people were received into protection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By an act of the commissioners this year Southampton upon Long Island was annexed to the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and Martha's Vineyard to the jurisdiction of the Massachusets.</NOTE> Cutshamach Sachem of the Massachusets in the neighbour|hood of Boston having subjected himself formerly to the English, Passaconaway and his sons from Merrimack now came voluntarily and desired that they also might be re|ceived upon the same articles.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1645.</NOTE>The next year 1645 a meeting extraordinary of the com|missioners was held at Boston, when it was thought necessary to send messengers to the Sachems of Naraganset and Mohe|gin to require their appearance at Boston and in the mean time to suspend the wars between the two nations. It seems to have been good policy not to have interposed in this quar|rel, but the English were afraid of the success of the Nara|gansets, who although they had by an accident lost their Sachem yet were much more numerous than the Mohegins, and had divers other stout Sachems, Pessicus, Canonicus, and others, to head their armies; and as the English had generally espoused the cause of the Mohegins it was feared that as|soon as they were subdued, if not in the course of the war, the Naragansets and their allies would fall upon the plan|tations of the English, against whom they were then in a peculiar manner enraged for the death of Miantinomo their Sachem; for after Uncas had taken him prisoner, being at a loss how to dispose of him, he carried him to Hartford and left him with the English there who kept him under a guard. Uncas applied to the commissioners for advice. They gave it as their opinion that Miantinomo ought to be put to death for having procured a Pequod to shoot Uncas, and for having been at the head of a conspiracy against the English, but they ordered Uncas to carry him out of their jurisdiction and to slay him without that torture and cru|elty usually practised by the Indians upon their prisoners. This sentence was executed accordingly, some of the English inhabitants accompanying the Indians to see it performed.</P>
<P>AT first the Naragansets gave kind words to the messen|gers from the English governments but they soon changed their tone and determined to have no peace without Un|cas's head. Mr. Williams from Providence gave notice to
<PB N="139" REF="009705_0074_0F7A45C5C3AC23C8">
the commissioners that the Naragansets would suddenly break out against the English. He himself had always been their favourite and they had settled a neutrality with the people of his colony. The commissioners drew up a declaration containing the foregoing with other facts, which they apprehended sufficient to justify them in making war against the Naragansets, and determined to raise 300 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massachusets 190, Plimouth 40, Connecticut 40, New-Haven 30.</NOTE> with all convenient speed, and that 40 should be dis|patched immediately from the Massachusets without wait|ing for the assembling of the general court, which the governor consented to. The two commissioners from the Massachusets <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Pelham.</NOTE> sent to the majors of Suffolk and Mid|lesex for their assistance in raising the 40 men, and at the same time, lest there should not be a voluntary inlistment, they sent warrants to the constables of the six nearest towns intimating the necessity, and requiring them to im|press the 40 men and a number of horses to be ready in two days, which was done accordingly. An attempt having been made for volunteers without success, the third day the whole number were impressed and sent away under Humphry Atherton their leader, with some horses and two of the Massachusets Indians for their guides, to wait at Mohegin for the Connecticut and New-Haven forces. The general court of the Massachusets met before the forces were out of the jurisdiction. The deputies took no exception to the impress of men upon an emergency although they had no voice in it, but thought it necessary that a commission from the whole court should be sent after the men, but the magistrates refused their consent, and the commissioners opposed the proceeding lest it should weaken their authority if any forces should be afterwards sent out by them. A commission was likewise given to Major Gibbons to be General of the forces of the united colonies for this expedition and instructions were given him, and vessels were preparing to transport provisions and other necessaries. The news of an army of English preparing
<PB N="140" REF="009705_0075_0F7A45C67730E030">
to march intimidated the Naragansets and brought them to submit to peace upon the terms proposed to them. Soon after the death of Miantinomo the Naragansets had sent a present of wampom to Mr. Winthrop desiring to keep peace with the English and to revenge their Sachem's death upon Uncas and the Mohegins. Mr. Win|throp refused to receive it upon those terms, but the mes|sengers desired they might leave it until they had further advised with their Sachems, which was allowed to be done. The commissioners being informed hereof thought it pro|per by messengers of their own to return the wampom. To return a belt received from the Indians is looked upon by them as the highest evidence of a refusal to comply with the proposals made at sending it. The messengers however departed from their instructions, for finding the Naragansets disposed to submit and that the Sachem and others were coming to Boston, they brought back the wam|pom, and wrote to the commander of the Connecticut forces and to the commander of the men sent from Massachusets, acquainting them with the prospect of peace, &amp;c. This action offended the commissioners who did not intend the proceeding of the forces should be reta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded.</P>
<P>PESSACUS with two other chief men of the Naragan|sets and Awasequan in behalf of the Nianticks, Janemo the Sachem being sick, within a few days after came to Boston with a large number of Indians in their train. The commissioners assured them, that however the treaty should end, they should receive no injury but shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d stay and return in safety, and then reminded them of their form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> treaty, by which they engaged not to enter into war with Uncas or any other Indians without first ac|quainting the English with the cause thereof, notwith|standing which they had this summer several times invaded Uncas and had slain, wounded and taken prisoners several of his people and done him much damage, and forced the English according to their engagements to send forces at different times to defend him; that when they were sent to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Massachusets and had fair offer made, they
<PB N="141" REF="009705_0075_0F7A45C67730E030">
abused the messengers, threatned the colonies, and declared
<Q>let who will have begun the war we will continue it until we have Uncas his head.</Q></P>
<P>THE Sachems at first charged Uncas with injuries, that he had taken a ransom for Miantinomo's life and then slew him, and they were loth to acknowledge any breach of covenant with the English. They offered to make peace with Uncas for a year or some short time, but this not being satisfactory, they desired to know what was expected from them. Whereupon the commissioners told them, that their breach of covenant was the cause of all the expence which the English had been at in preparing for war, and it was reasonable that they should reimburse it, but the com|missioners to shew their moderation demanded only 2000 fathoms of wampum (which was a sum far short of their charges) to be paid at different periods, and that they should restore to Uncas his captives and canoes, and make satisfaction for destroying his corn &amp;c, keep perpetual peace with the English and all their allies and subjects, and give hostages for the performance of their engage|ments. These were hard terms and it was with great re|luctance that they finally submitted to them, but they knew that part of the English forces was gone into their country, and they were afraid that even whilst the treaty was de|pending hostilities would be begun, and finally the 30th of August 1645 they signed to the agreement as the com|missioners had prepared it, and left some of their number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pessacus's child and a child of his brother and two other children of persons of note.

In 1638 having entertained some of the Pequods after the war with them and fearing he had given offence, he came to the governor at Boston and brought a present which was at first refused, but afterwards, the governor being satisfied that he had no designs against the English, it was accepted and he promised to submit to such orders as he should receive from the English concerning the Pequods, and also con|cerning the Naragansets and his behavior towards them, and concluded his speech with these words:
<Q>This heart (laying his hand upon his breast) is not mine but your's. Command me any difficult service and I will do it; I have no men but they are all your's. I will never believe any Indian against the English any more.</Q>

<P>The Naragansets failed in the payment of the wampum, and in 1646 messengers were sent to them from the commissioners, but Pessacus their chief Sachem not attending, in 1647 the message was repeated, and he then pretended sickness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent Ninigrate, a Sachem of the Nianticks, to act in his behalf, and told the messenger that it was true he had not kept his cove|nant, but added that he entred into it for fear of the army which he saw, and that he was told that if he did not set his hand to such and such things the army should go against the Naragansets. When Ninigrate appeared, he asked how the Naragansets became indebted to the English in so large a sum, and being told that it was for the expence the Naragansets had put them to by their breach of covenant, he then pleaded poverty, but the commissioners in|sisting on the demand he sent some of his people back to procure what he could, but brought 200 fathom only. They gave him leave to go home and allowed him further time. The whole was not paid until 1650, when Capt. Atherton with twenty men was sent to demand the arrears, which was then about 300 fathoms. Pessacus put him off some time with dilatory answers, not suffering him to come into his presence. In the mean while his people were gathering together, but the Captain carrying his twenty soldiers to the door of the wigwam, entred himself with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pistol in his hand, leaving his men without, and seizing Pessacus by the hair of his head drew him from the midst of a great number of his attendants, threatning that if one of them offered to stir he would dispatch him. Pessacus presently paid down what was demanded and the English returned in safety. Ninigrate after this began to stir up new troubles from the Nian|ticks, but upon sending Capt. Davis with a troop of horse into the Indian country he was struck with a panick and would not be seen by the English until he had assurance of his life, and then he readily complied with their demands, and they and the other Indians continued quiet many years, until by familiar intercourse and the use of fire-arms they became more emboldened, and en|gaged in the war in 1675 which issued in their total destruction, Records of united colonies.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="009705_0076_0F7A45C802D02760">ABOUT this time there was another struggle for power between the assistants or magistrates, and the deputies. The latter could not bear their votes should lose their effect by the non-concurrence of the former who were so much fewer in number; but, by the firmness of Mr. Winthrop, the assistants maintained their right at this time, and (March 25, 1644) the deputies, not being able to prevail, moved that the two houses might sit apart, and from that time votes were sent in a parliamentary way from one house to the other, and the consent of both was necessary to an act of the court. This continued a short time without any further provision, but finally the magistrates consented, that in appeals from the lower courts and all judicial proceedings, if the two houses differed the major vote of the whole should deter|mine. The deputies also looked with envy upon the powers exercised by the magistrates in the recess of the general court, and sent up a vote or bill to join some of their number with the magistrates, who should receive a commission from the court, but this was refused as an in|novation upon the charter. The house then desired the magistrates would suspend the exercise of their executive power until the next session. They answered that they must act as occasion required according to the trust reposed in them. The speaker told them they would not be obeyed. The court broke up in this temper. But, dis|turbances happening with the Indians, it was called together again in a short time, and the deputies voted that <HI>(salvojure)</HI> for the peace and safety of the colony the governor and

assistants should take order for the welfare of the people in all sudden cases which may happen within the juris|diction, until the next session of the court. By agreement, all the ministers were called in at the next session in order to give their opinion upon the point in difference. They determined that the governor, deputy governor, and assis|tants were invested with the magistratical power, (the nature and extent of this power is left in the dark,) and that they do not derive it from the people, who were only to design such persons as they thought fit for the exercise of those powers. Several other points were referred to the ministers at the same time, and all agreed to by both houses with some small amendment.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mass. Rec.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE controversy between the two houses at this time was occasioned by a difference in sentiment upon the iden|tity of a swine which was claimed by a poor woman as having strayed from her some years before, and her title being disputed by a person of more consequence, divided not the court only but the whole country. The identity of Martin Guerre was not more controverted in France. Pity and compassion for the poor woman prevailed with the common people against right. At last those magistrates who had been in favour of the other side, for the magistrates were divided too, Dudley on one side and Bellingham the other, persuaded the person who they supposed had a good title, and who had recovered below, to relinquish it, that the publick peace might be restored. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">MS.</NOTE></P>

<P>A great disturbance was caused in the colony this year by a number of persons of figure but of different senti|ments, both as to civil and ecclesiastical government, from the people in general. William Vassal, as we have observed, came over with the first patentees and was one of the assistants in 1630 but soon after returned to Eng|land, and in the year 1635 came back to New-England and settled at Scituate in the colony of New-Plimouth. He was a gentleman of a pleasant affable disposition but always opposite to the government both in the Massachusets and Plimouth. Scituate in Plimouth is contiguous to Hingham in the Massachusets, and Mr. Vassal had much influence in the latter colony as well as the former, and had laid a scheme for petitions of such as were non-free|men to the courts of both colonies, and upon the petitions being refused, to apply to the parliament, pretending they were subjected to an arbitrary power, extrajudicial pro|ceedings, &amp;c. The two first of the Massachusets peti|tioners were Samuel Maverick and Robert Child. Mr. Maverick, being in the colony at the arrival of the charter, was made a freeman before the law confining freedom to such only as were members of churches was in force, but, being an episcopalian, had never been in any office. Child was a young gentleman just before come from Padua, where he studied physic, and as was reputed, had taken the de|gree of doctor. The principal things complained of by the petitioners were,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="146" REF="009705_0078_0F7A45CC70A39578">1st. THAT the fundamental laws of England were not owned by the colony as the basis of their government according to patent.</P>

<P>AND they prayed that civil liberty and freedom might be forthwith granted to all truly English, and that all members of the church of England or Scotland, not scandalous, might be admitted to the privileges of the churches of New-England, or, if these civil and religious liberties were refused, that they might be freed from the heavy taxes imposed upon them, and from the impresses made of them or their children or servants into the war; and if they failed of redress there, they should be under a necessity of making application to England to the honorable houses of parliament, who they hoped would take their sad con|dition into consideration, provide able ministers for them, New-England having none such to spare, or else transport them to some other place, their estates being wasted, where they may live like christians, &amp;c. But if their prayer should be granted they hoped to see the then contemned ordinances of God highly prized, the gospel then dark break forth as the sun, christian charity then frozen wax warm, jealousy of arbitrary government banished, strife and contention abated, and all business in church and state, which for many years had gone backward, successfully thriving, &amp;c.</P>

He first proposed leaving off the custom of drinking one to another, and then procured a law to prohibit it. He pursued with great vehemence Mr. Vane's adherents.

The commissioners of Plimouth and New-Haven deter|mined that the tax should be paid until the next meeting, but they would then hear any further objections from the Massachusets against it. In 1648 among other things the Massachusets insisted upon Connecticut's producing their patent to shew their authority. Connecticut urged that the line had never been run by persons in behalf of the two governments to ascertain whether Springfield was within the Massachusets jurisdiction or not. The com|missioners at this meeting recommended the running the line and ordered that in the mean time the tax should con|tinue. The Massachusets represented that Mr. Fenwick was to have joined with them in running the line but failed them, and thereupon it was run at their own charge by which it appeared that Weronoke (Westfield) was within their patent and had been so adjudged by the commissioners; notwithstanding this they were ready to join with their brethren of Connecticut in another survey if they would be at the charge as the Massachusets had been before, and would also produce their patent as the Massachusets had produced their patent. Connecticut commissioners denied that Mr. Fenwick had promised to join in running the line, having only in general terms promised to endeavor to clear Springfield from being within the Massachusets patent, and alledged, that the running the line referred to was a year before this promise, and therefore proposed that the southerly extent of the Massachusets patent should be first agreed upon and settled, and then at a mutual charge the line be run by some skilful man chosen by each colony, &amp;c. that as for their patent the Massachusets knew the original could not then be obtained but they were ready to produce an authentic copy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>UPON this, the Massachusets commissioners to the dis|honor of the colony produced a law of their general court imposing a custom or duty upon the other colonies of the tenor following.</P>

<P>HAD the Massachusets laid a duty on goods from Con|necticut only they might have had at least a colour, perhaps more than a colour, to justify them, but to extend their resentment to the other two colonies for giving judgment against them, no excuse can be framed for it. It was a meer exertion of power, and a proof of their great superio|rity which enabled them, in effect, to depart from the union or combination whensoever they found it for their interest,

<P>THE union or confederacy had rendered the colonies formidable to French and Dutch as well as to the natives, and a breach at this time would have given great advantage to the enemies of New-England; the commissioners of Plimouth and New-Haven therefore agreed upon a final result of the following tenor, viz.
<Q>That they were in hopes according to the advice given at Plimouth this con|troversy might have been happily issued, but they find that the Massachusets line had not been since run, nor was the place where it should begin agreed upon, that the original patent or an exemplification thereof is required from Connec|ticut, altho' Mr. Hopkins had offered to swear to the truth of a copy by him presented, and that the Massachusets had imposed a burthensome custom as a return or retaliation, not upon Connecticut only the party interested, but upon Plimouth and New-Haven, whose commissioners according to an article of the union and at the request of the Massa|chusets had impartially considered the matter in contro|versy and given their opinion therein; therefore the commissioners recommend it to the general court of the Massachusets, seriously to consider whether such proceed|ings agree with the law of love and the tenor and import of the articles of confederation, but in the mean time desire to be spared in all further agitations concerning Springfield.</Q>

by a party of Dutch whom they then found there. Those from the Massachusets in the years 1635 and 1636 made their principal settlement upon that part of the river where the Dutch had their house,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hartford.</NOTE> and for many years made no attempts to remove them, allowing them free liberty of trade with English and Indians. The Dutch also admitted any English to settle among them at the Manhadoes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Willet, Baxter, and divers other families.</NOTE> When Mr. Eaton and his company sat down at New-Haven, the Dutch from the rapid increase of the English colonies were alarmed, and charged them with encroachments, although they themselves had no pretence to any certain boundary and would sometimes challenge the country from Cape Henlopen to Connecticut river, and at other times as far as Cape Cod. The English, re|gardless of this claim went on extending their settlements to Milford, Stamford, and other places, until they were within a few miles of Hudson's river. Whether the Dutch had any pretence of title or not, no doubt can be made that they would have extirpated the English if it had been in their power, but they were few in number. Once in|deed being possessed of a ship of some force they sent her to New-Haven and seized a Dutch vessel which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay in the harbour and carried her away, the English having no naval force nor fortifications on land to prevent it. At another time they set up the arms of the States at or near Stamford and threatned to do the like at New-Haven, and there were altercations for many years first between Kieft the first Dutch governor and afterwards Stuyvesant his successor, and Mr. Eaton the governor of New-Haven. The Dutch had always restrained the English, not settled among them, from trading with their Indians upon Hudson's river. In 1648 the commissioners passed an order prohibiting any French or Dutch or other foreigners trading with the Indians within the jurisdiction of the united colonies. This law if carried into execution must have put an end to the Dutch trade at Hartford. In 1650, while the
<PB N="159" REF="009705_0084_0F7A45D042934958">
commissioners were sitting at Hartford, the Dutch governor (Stuyvesant) came thither in order to treat, and presented his proposals in writing, dated "New-Netherlands the 23d of September N. S." being the day they were delivered. He complained of the encroachments at Connecticut river as well as towards Hudson's river, of the reception of fugitives, of the law debarring them from trade with the Indians, and of the English for selling goods too cheap to the Indians and so spoiling the trade, &amp;c. The com|missioners took notice, that his proposals were dated at New-Netherlands and refused to treat until he altered the name of the place where they were dated. He offered that if the English would forbear stiling the place Hart|ford he would forbear stiling it New-Netherlands, and date his proposals at Connecticut. They consented that he should date at Connecticut, but would not give up their own right to date at Hartford. After several days spent in messages from one to the other, the matters in difference were submitted to Mr. Bradstreet and Mr. Prince appoint|ed by the commissioners, and to Thomas Willet and George Baxter appointed by the Dutch governor. Their result was to be binding to both parties. The line which was settled ran northerly only 20 miles in length from the sea, and afterwards as the Dutch and New-Haven should agree, so not as to come within 10 miles of Hudson's river. This must be understood so far as New-Haven had jurisdiction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Accordingly we find that the Massachusets in the year 1659 so understood it, and made a grant of land opposite to fort Aurania (Albany) upon Hudson's river, and a number of the principal merchants in the colony were enterprizing a settlement and a trade with the Indians, which probably was laid aside upon the change of affairs in England. The country itself a few years after was recovered from the Dutch and granted to the Duke of York, too powerful a proprietor to contend with about bounds. As this settlement is the only piece of evidence of any certain boundary to the New Netherlands while in possession of the Dutch it is difficult to assign any sufficient reason why the colony of New York should extend further upon the colonies of Connecticut or Massachusets than this agreement would carry it. When the Massachusets charter was granted the Dutch had no possessions at any distance from Hudson's river. Any grants or patents of vast tracts or manors made by the Dutch without possession or im|provement seem to be void both in law and equity, and would have been as good if they had extended 200 miles from the river as when they extended 20. Notwithstanding this settlement, after the English were possessed of New-Netherlands, Connecticut was disturbed in their possessions and finally obliged to give up their claim to Long Island, and to submit to a line of about 20 miles distant from Hudson's river, giving an equivalent for their settled towns upon the sound, the jurisdiction as well as property where|of they retained, which Douglass says, but without any authority, did not originally belong to Connecticut. The line between the Massachusets and New-York still remains controverted.</NOTE></P>

One professed design of the colony charter was the gos|pelizing the natives. The long neglect of any attempts this way cannot be excused. The Indians themselves asked how it happened if christianity was of such importance that for six and twenty years together the English had said nothing to them about it. The answer by the English was that they repented they had not done it long ago, telling the Indians withal they were not willing to hear, &amp;c. Some of the Indians who were taken as servants into English families attained to some acquaintance with the principles of religion, and seemed to have been affected with what they
<PB N="161" REF="009705_0085_0F7A45D1013D6200">
had been taught concerning their existence after death and with the fears of the divine displeasure. John, the Saga|more of the Massachusets, would sometimes praise the Eng|lish and their God "much good men much good God" and when he was struck with death sent for Mr. Wilson and desired him to teach his son to know the God of the English after he was dead. Mention has also been made of Wequash the Pequod; but the first instance of an Indian who gave any hopes of becoming a real christian was that of Hiacoomes, in the year 1643, at Martha's-Vineyard.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket were not included in either of the four New-England governments. The Earl of Stirling laid claim to all the Island's between Cape Cod and Hudson's river. James Forett agent for his lordship on the 10th of October 1641 grants to Thomas Mayhew of Watertown and Thomas Mayhew his son Nantucket and two small islands adjacent, and the 23d day of the same month Martha's Vineyard and Elizabeth islands, and agreeable to the opinion of that day, of which we have given so many instances, grants the same powers of government which the Massachusets people enjoyed by their charter. Mr. Mayhew was called the governor of the islands. The Duke of York after his second grant in 1673 included them in his commission to his governors of New-York. The grants of the soil of these islands could not vacate the right of the Indian Sachems and proprietors, and I suppose most of the present inhabitants and proprietors de|rive their titles from Indian grants posterior to the grant to Lord Stirling or to that made by his agent to Mr. Mayhew and his son.</NOTE> Under the instruction of Mr. Mayhew he was induced to forsake the Indian Pawaws to attend the English assemblies, and after some years became himself a preacher to his own people. It was in the year 1646 that the general court of the Massachusets passed the first act or order to encourage the carrying the gospel to the Indians, and it was then recom|mended to the elders to consider how it might best be done. On the 28th of October four persons, who are not named, made the first visit to the Indian wigwams. Wabun the Sachem <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I take it of those who were afterwards called Natick Indians.</NOTE> had notice given him and many Indians were gathered together. None of the English were suffi|ciently skilled in the Indian language to make a prayer in it, and the meeting was opened with a prayer in English,

but one of the company in a discourse in the Indian tongue began with the moral law and a brief explication of it and the wrath and curse God the just portion of the breakers of this law, and then informed them of the com|ing of Christ into the world to recover mankind from sin and the punishment of it, his sufferings and death, resur|rection and ascension, and that he would come again at the end of the world to be the judge of all men. They then entred into a free conversation with the Indians and desired them, upon any point which they did not understand, to ask such questions as they thought proper, which was done accordingly, and it became the constant practice after a sermon for as many of the Indians as desired it to stand up and propose questions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Col.

This meet|ing gave so much encouragement that on the 11th of No|vember they paid the Indians another visit at the same place and found a greater number than were present be|fore.

Mr. Winslow being in England sought to obtain sub|scriptions for encouraging the work. Mr. Eliot a minister in New-England at the same time applied himself with zeal equal to that of the missionaries of the Romish church;
<PB N="163" REF="009705_0086_0F7A45D1EC94E338">
but instead of adopting a favorite maxim of some of that church, that ignorance is the mother of devotion, he endea|voured to enlighten the understandings of theIndians, to draw them from their savage, barbarous, and wandering way of life, to civility, government and cohabitation, and it was a noted saying of his
<Q>that the Indians must be civilized as well as, if not in order to their being, christianized.</Q>
He obtained from the court the grant of a tract of land, to which he gave the Indian name of Noonanetum, (Rejoicing) drew as many families there as he could with design to make a fortified town, instructed them in their husbandry, and ex|cited them to industry and a prudent management of their affairs, caused some of them to learn such trades as were most necessary for them, so as that they compleatly built a house for publick worship 50 feet in length and 25 in breadth, which Mr. Wilson, in one of his letters, says
<Q>ap|peared like the workmanship of an English housewright.</Q>
Besides this settlement at Noonanerum he visited and preached to the Indians at Dorchester mills, Watertown, Concord, and as far as Pantucket falls on Merrimack river, to the Indians also in the colony of Plimouth, although Massasoiet or Ousamequin and his son discountenanced the bringing the gospel to their tribe. The Naraganset Sa|chem treated with contempt a message he sent to them, but the Nipnets desired some might be sent to teach them to pray to God.

<P><PB N="165" REF="009705_0087_0F7A45D2964A7390">LETTERS at the same time were published from the two universities nf Oxford and Cambridge, calling upon the ministers of England and Wales to stir up their congrega|tions to a liberal contribution for the promotion of so glo|rious an undertaking.</P>
<P>THE purport of the first letter to the commissioners from the corporation was to acquaint them with Mr. Winslow's determination to return to New-England, which would be greatly prejudicial to the work, and to intimate to them that he ought to be no sufferer by his continuance in Eng|land. The commissioners of the Massachusets proposed to make Mr. Winslow the agent for the united colonies, but as he had gone over in the service of the Massachusets only, the rest of the colonies declined the proposal, and all that could be obtained was a letter from the commissioners to the corporation approving of Mr. Winslow's stay in Eng|land, and desiring that one hundred pounds sterling might be paid him out of the collections, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I cannot find that either of the colonies have ever advanced any considerable sums for this service.</NOTE> with a promise that if it was not approved of as a proper charge, it should be re|placed by the colonies.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>Great opposition was made to the collection in England, and the conversion of the Indians was represented as a meer pretence to draw money from men of pious minds. It went on so slowly that an attempt was made to raise a sum out of the army. Hugh Peters was one of the collectors, but the corporation wrote to the com|missioners that he not only refused to pay a penny himself but discouraged others because, as they supposed, he had no hand in laying the plan. However, such favorable accounts were from time to time published of the success of the mission that when King Charles came in the corporation was possessed of six or seven hundred pounds per annum, which was in danger of being all lost, being derived from the establishment of the parliament, but by the interest of some good men, of whom the celebrated Robert Boyle was one, a new charter was obtained, by which the estate was secured. Mr. Boyle was chosen and continued many years the governor, and the commissioners of the united colonies were the correspondents in New-England until the charter was vacated. After that commissioners were specially appointed by the corporation, consisting of the principal gentlemen of the civil order and of the clergyin New-England, and vacancies by death or otherwise have from time to time been filled up until the present time. Perhaps no fund of this nature has ever been more faith|fully applied to the purposes for which it was raised. If we com|pare the requisites to determine any one to be a convert in Mr. Eliot's esteem with those of the popish missionaries it is not strange that their number hath exceeded his. Before the converts in New-England were admitted to the ordinances they were examined by some of the magistrates as well as ministers The confessions of many of them as taken from their own mouths were sent to Eng|land and printed and there approved of: And although the mission began in 1646 it was the year 1651 before the first church was gathered, viz. at Natick. Whereas with the Romish priests the repetition of a Pater Noster or Ave Maria or perhaps the telling over a few beads, made them fit subjects of baptism. Mr. Eliot, as has been observed, always insisted upon their being civilized and becoming men at the same time they became christians. This was <HI>naturam expellere,</HI> and it was with great reluctance they for|sook any of their savage customs. The French Coureurs de Bois and others married among the Indians and became savages them|selves and the priests went into their country and dwelt among them, suffered them to retain their old customs and conformed to them themselves. However, the number of Indians in New-England which have from time to time made profession of Christianity is far from inconsiderable. In 1660 there were ten Indian towns of such as were called Praying Indians. (Goffe's journal) Mr. Eliot mentions a visitation he made in 1670. He went down to the Indians at Makt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pos, I suppose what we now call Mashpee, where Richard Bourne, a godly man, on the 17th of August was ordained pastor to an Indian church which was gathered upon that day, and the Indians and such of their children as were present were baptized. From thence he passed over to the Vineyard, where many were received into the church, men and women, and they and their children baptized, the sacrament of the Lord's supper was administred in the Indian church, and many of the English church desiring to join with them, it was celebrated in both languages. Two teaching and two ruling elders were ordained, and a foundation was laid for two churches more. The teacher of the praying Indians at Nantucket came to the Vineyard and made report that there were about ninety fa|milies that prayed unto God in that island, and advice was given that some of the most godly among them should join to the church at the Vineyard, and after some experience of their orderly walk, should issue forth into church state among themselves and have officers ordained. The Indians were very desirous of having Mr. Mayhew for their pastor but he declined it, conceiving that he could serve them better in the capacity he was in of advising and instructing in the management of their church affairs, and was willing to die in the service of Jesus Christ. Advice was given for the settling of schools and that all who neglected sending their children should be liable to censure. Mr. Eliot then takes notice of the state of the Indians in the Bay. Natick was the chief town where most of the Indian rulers dwelt, and where their courts were held. There were two teachers John and Anthony, and betwixt forty and fifty communicants, and sundry more proposed to join to the church. Punkapog (now Stoughton) was the second town where the Sachems of the blood, as they term the chief royal line, had their residence and rights, which (in other parts) as Mr. Eliot says, were mostly alienated to the English towns. I suppose the Indians of Naponset or Milton before this time had removed and were settled with those of Punkapog beyond or about the blue hills. Their chief ruler and teacher was Ahauton. A family or two of his descendants remain to this day.</P>
<P>Hassunimesut or as it is now pronounced Hassanemisco were the In|dians next in order of dignity and antiquity, from thence came some of the chief friends to praying to God. They lay upon Nichmug river, and were strict observers of the sabbath, and were judged by all travellers especially such who had occasion to lodge among them to be sincere in their religious professions. They had two teachers Annuweekin and Tuppukkoowelin characterized found and godly men. I suppose those who are called Grafton Indians about 8 or 10 families are all the remains of Hassanemisco.</P>
<P>Ogguonikongquamesut was the next praying town which bordered upon Marlborough. The English meeting house being placed within the line of the Indian town, caused great disputes and dis|couragements. Solomon judged to be a serious and sound chris|tian was their teacher.

<P>Nashope was the next. Tahattawans was called a Sachem of the blood, a faithful zealous christian was their ruler. Their minister John Thomas, a godly understanding christian, was their teacher.

<P>Pantucket, at the falls in Merrimack river, was the place of another set of praying Indians. The Pennicook Indians had come down the river and built a fort at Pantucket and were great opposers and obstinately refused to pray to God, but being concerned in the expedition against the Mohawks they were most of them cut off, and since that time the Pantucket Indians were, at least seve|ral of them, become praying Indians, and Jethro was sent to preach Christ to them.</P>
<P>Magunhukquok where Simon was teacher on the west of Natick, and Quanatusset which was under the care of the Hassanamisco teachers are the two other towns men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ioned. By this account of Mr. Eliot we see the state of the christianized Indians in 1670. The greatest body of Indians, viz. Massasoiets or Woosamequins, and after|wards his son Philip's or Metacom's subjects were ever averse to christianity, so were the Naragansets. These two nations engag|ing in war against the English in 1675 had drawn off some of the Indians of the praying towns to join with them and occasioned fears and jealousies of all the rest, which caused a great discou|ragement, but the war being at an end in 1676 and the two other nations the Wamponoags and Naragansets, the great enemies of christianity, being wholly extirpated the Indians which remained in the Massachusets and Plimouth have in general ever since pro|fessed to be christians. In 1687 as appears by a letter of Dr. In|crease Mather to Dr. Leusden at Utrecht, there were four Indian assemblies in Massachusets besides the principal church at Natick. In Plimouth besides the principal church at Mashapee there were five assemblies in that vicinity, and a large congregation at Saco|net. There were also six different societies, probably but small, with an Indian teacher to each between the last mentioned and Cape Cod, all under the care of Mr. Treat minister of Eastham, one church at Nantucket, and three at Martha's Vineyard. There were in all six assemblies formed into a church state, having officers and the ordinances duly administred, and sixteen assemblies which met together for the worship of God. It does not appear that the number of christians have since decreased by the return of the Indians to paganism, The Indians themselves are wasted and their tribes or nations every where in Massachusets and Plimouth extinct, except at Mashapee, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket. At Mashapee and near it are about 80 families, at the Vineyard about 80, and at Nantucket where the last year were 90 families there are now but 15 remaining. There is besides a town of In|dians in the western part of the province called Houssatonick Indians, who removed about 30 years ago from Hudson's river, who have a settled English minister or missionary supported by the corporation, perhaps 70 or 80 families generally reside there. They waste away as all other Indians have done, and there would have been a more sensible diminution of their numbers if they had not from time to time received additions from abroad of other nations, or of such of their own nation as did not at first incline to remove with them. These with a few families at Natick and Grafton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a family or two together scattered here and there about th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> province, are all the Indians at present within the province of Massachusets-Bay.</P></NOTE></P>

that all matters of that nature were left to the commis|sioners of the united colonies, he returned to Canada, and the next year two gentlemen were sent with letters to the commissioners, praying in behalf of the French of Canada, and of the christianized Indians in Accadie, the aid of the English against the Indians of the six nations, urging
<Q>that it was a just war, the Mohawks being breakers of the most solemn leagues, perfidious and cruel, that it was a holy war, the eastern Indians being persecuted and cruelly hand|led because of their professing the christian religion, that it was of common concern, the Mohawks disturbing and interrupting the trade both of English and French with other Indians.</Q>
They promised a due consideration and allowance for the expence of the war. If the English would not join in the war it was then desired that the French might have leave to inlist volunteers, and that they might be victualled for the service, and if that could not be obtained that at least the French might be allowed to pass through the colonies by water and land as occasion should require. Until these points were settled they
<PB N="170" REF="009705_0090_0F7A45D4C3C90E20">
could not proceed upon the treaty of commerce. The commissioners having duly weighed the proposals returned an answer in substance as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>THAT they were willing to admit that the French and eastern Indians might have just grounds to their own satis|faction for war against the Mohawks: That they looked upon all such Indians as received the yoke of Christ with another eye than upon others who worship the devil:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But such Indians have generally been taught to treat the English as heretics with greater cruelty, and it has been made more meri|torious to extirpate them than if they had been infidels or the worst of idolaters.</NOTE> That they desired by all just means to keep peace, if it may be, with all men even with these barbarians. That the Mohawks living at a distance from the sea have little intercourse with these parts, but in the war the English had with the Pequods 14 or 16 years before the Mohawks shewed a real respect and had offered no hostilities since. That the English engaged in no war before they had full and satisfying evidence that it was just, nor before peace upon just terms had been offered and refused. That the Mohawks, not being subject to them, nor in league with them, they could not require an account of their proceedings, and had no means of information what they had to say for themselves. That to make war with the Mohawks would expose the Indians who were neighbours to the English, some of whom professed christianity, &amp;c. That although they were ready to perform all neighbourly offices of righteous|ness and peace to the French colony, yet they could neither permit volunteers to be taken up nor the French and eastern Indians to pass through the English jurisdiction to invade the Mohawks, lest they should expose not the Indians only but the smaller English plantations to danger. That the English were much dissatisfied with that mis|chievous trade the French and Dutch have had and still continue, by selling guns powder and shot to all the Indians, which rendered them insolent, &amp;c. That if all other difficulties were removed yet they had no such short and convenient passage, either by land or water, as might be

<P>THE college at Cambridge became more and more an object of attention, and in the year 1650 was made a body corporate by act of the general court, and received a charter under the seal of the colony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Under this charter the college was governed until the year 1685&punc; when the colony charter was vacated, saving that in 1673 by an order of the general court some addition was made to the num|ber of the corporation. Mr. Dudley (who was a son of the college) when he received a commission for President of the colony altered the title of the President of the college for that of Rector, but no attempts were made to take away the estate or stock of the college or to impose officers disagreeable to the country in general, but the government continued, in name at least, under the former corporation, who were Increase Mather rector, John Sherman, Nehemiah Hubbard, John Cotton, John Leveret and William Brattle as fellows (the two last were tutors also) and John Richards treasurer. When Mr. Mather the rector went to England in 1688, in his minutes of an intended petition to the King, he says, that when the civil government was changed the college was under the inspection of these persons and he supposed it continued so, except that Mr. Sherman was dead, in whose room he prayed Mr. Samuel Sewall might be appointed, and that the King would confirm the government in their hands; but although these were in name the governors they were not always so in fact.

<P>The president of the colony, and afterwards the governor, assumed the whole authority when they thought fit. The rights of Mag|dalen college Oxford invaded, justly might alarm the whole nation, but Harvard college was too inconsiderable, had the proceedings been ever so arbitrary and oppressive, to occasion any great notice. Mr. Mather the rector went to England in 1688. No person was appointed in his stead. Sir E. Andros the governor wrote to Mr. Samuel Lee the minister of Bristol in New-Plimouth colony, to desire him to officiate at the commencement, but not receiving an answer in proper season (it seems the letter was delayed) Mr. William Hubbard was appointed and offi|ciated accordingly. In 1692 upon the arrival of the province charter, although by a clause in the charter with a special view to the college, it was provided that no grants, &amp;c. to any towns, colleges, schools of learning, &amp;c. should be preju|diced through defect of form, &amp;c. but should remain in force as at the time of vacating the colony charter, yet the president and many others with him were desirous of a new charter with ad|ditional powers and priviledges. An act of the general court passed for that purpose in 1692, incorporating the college on a larger foundation than the former charter. Among other things the college was enabled to confer such degrees as are conferred by the universities in Europe, whereas under the former charter no higher degrees had been given than those of batchelors and masters of arts. This privilege was exercised in one instance only, a diploma for a doctorate, under the college seal, being presented to Mr. Mather the president. Before the expiration of three years the act of incorporation was disallowed. Those who interested themselves for the college were resolved upon further attempts; another provincial act passed in 1697 with some variations, which before 1700 was likewise disapproved, for at a session of the court that year a vote passed the council and house of representatives approving the form of a charter which they were willing the college should accept from the King, and I make no doubt the agents were instructed to endeavour to obtain a charter in such form. By this charter the corporation was to consist of a presi|dent, vice-president and fifteen fellows. It may not be unaccep|table to some to have their names preserved. Increase Mather president, Samuel Willard vice-president, James Allen, Michael Wigglesworth, Samuel Torrey, Nehemiah Hobart, Peter Thacher, Samuel Angier, John Danforth, Cotton Mather, Nehemiah Walter, Henry Gibbs, John White, Jonathan Pierpoint, and Benjamin Wadsworth, together with the two senior tutors resident at college were the first corporation named in the charter. The college was impowered to hold real estate to the amount of three thousand pounds per annum. The governor and the council were made the visitors. This application proved as ineffectual as the former. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> true reason of the several failures appears from a letter of Mr. Blaithwait to the president, dated 1st June 1704, which says
<Q>that the only obstruction to the passing the charter was Sir Henry Ashurst's refusing to allow of a clause for a visitation by the King or his governor.</Q>

<P>Sir, I received a letter from the reverend president of Harvard college by Mr. White fellow of the said college, together with a copy of an act of the assembly for incorporating the college. And I am of opinion that his Majesty will not give his royal approbation to that act as it stands worded, because it differs very materially from the terms of incorporation proposed by their excellencies the Lords Justices of England, viz. that the King and his gover|nors should be the visitors, whereas the act of assembly vests the power of visitation of that college as well in the council as gover|nor, which his Majesty may probably think derogatory to his prerogative. And I am apprehensive also that those noble Lords who under the title of Lords Justices of England lately exercised the royal authority will confirm his Majesty that it will be a dimi|nution to the prerogative of the crown to make the council co|ordinate in the power of visitation with the King's governor.&mdash;For my own part I have a very great respect for the King's pre|rogative&punc; but I could wish a way were found to secure the statutes or privileges of Harvard college against the capricious humour of future governors, who out of prejudice to the way of worship used there, or for some sinister ends, may be vexatious to the college. There is great difference between the exercise of the prerogative in England and in these remote parts of his Majesty's dominion&punc; There, the subject, whenever that exercise is abused, has the King, the fountain of justice, near at hand to recur to for redress. In these provinces, governors, I fear by what I have discovered since my being in America, are made bold and pre|sumptuous in breaking the laws and governing arbitrarily, out of conceit that their being so far from under the eye of the govern|ment of England will be a sure cause of impunity to them. Therefore upon the whole matter I must in judgment and con|science declare for a qualification of the power of a governor in the case of the visitation of Harvard college, but what that qua|lification should be I must leave to his Majesty's wisdom and goodness to determine.</P>

<P>During these attempts, until advice of the respective acts being dis|allowed, the college was governed conformable to them. While no acts were in force, temporary orders passed the general court from time to time, impowering such persons to act as a corporation as were therein named. But in 1707, all prospect of a new foun|dation being gone, it was thought proper to resort to the old, and the charter of 1650 hath been conformed to ever since. The several heads of the college from its first establishment to this day have been as follows. Mr. Eaton appointed in 1638 continued until 1640, when Mr. Henry Dunstar was appointed, who was succeeded by Mr. Charles Chauncy in 1654, who continued until 1671. Doctor Leonard Hoar succeeded Mr. Chauncy. Douglass says Mr. Hoar was a doctor of physick from Cambridge in Old England. He was educated at Cambridge in New-England, and took his batchelor's degree in 1650, went over to England in November 1653, was made a doctor at Cambridge, and returned not long before he was elected July 30, 1672. The students were too much indulged in their prejudices against him and he was obliged to resign March 15, 1674-5. His wife was daughter to Lord Lisle. Mr. Urian Oakes, minister of Cambridge, was his successor, and continued from April 7, 1675, until his death in 1681. Mr. Mather was chosen by the corporation and confirmed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and moderated at the masters dispu|tations and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the degrees at the commencement in 1681, but his church in Boston being unwilling to part with him, on April 20th 1682 Mr. John Rogers was chosen and confirmed, but died in 1684, being suddenly seized the morning of commence|ment, July 1st, and dying the next day. Mr. William Hubbard of Ipswich moderated at the publick exercises. Mr. Mather suc|ceeded Mr. Rogers, and continued at the head of the college until Sept. 6, 1701. Mr. Samuel Willard, by order of court, officiated several years as vice-president, no president being ap|pointed instead of Mr. Mather, until Mr. John Leveret was by the governor, at the head of the overseers, declared president January 14, 1707, and the college was put under his care,
<Q>agre|able to the choice of the fellows of the house, approbation of the overseers, and votes of the council and assembly in their last pre|ceding session, the governor directing him to govern that house and the scholars there with duty and allegiance to our Sovereign Lady the Queen and obedience to her Majesty's laws.</Q>
Mr. Leveret continued in the presidentship until his death in 1724. Mr. Ben|jamin Wadsworth, a minister of one of the churches in Boston, succeeded him. He died in 1737, and was succeeded by Mr. Holyoke, who continues in the presidentship at this time.</P></NOTE></P>

Under the new charter the selectmen have no judiciary power. They still are said to manage the prudential affairs. What is intended by the word prudential when thus appropriated is not very easy to determine. Be it what it may, all other town affairs are determined in a general town meeting of all the inhabitants. The inconveniency that must arise from such a constitution, where a town consists of a thousand or fifteen hundred voters, are too many to be enu|merated, and too obvious to need it. There was a disposition fifty years ago in most of the principal inhabitants of Boston to be made a corporation. A plan was formed in order to be laid be|fore the general court of the province, which by the charter is impowered to make corporations. When the heads of it were presented at a town-meeting a demagogue called out

<P>SIR Ferdinando Gorges had made attempts for many years to settle the province of Main, but to little purpose. He was a zealous royalist and neither he nor his descen|dants who were in the same interest could expect any favor from the parliament. The colony seems to have been de|serted by the proprietors, and in the year 1651 the people were in confusion and the authority of the government was at an end. In 1641 a charter had been granted by Sir Fer|dinando to Acamenticus (York) making it a corporation consisting of a mayor, eight aldermen and a recorder. His cousin Thomas Gorges was the first mayor. He lived about half a mile above what is called Trafton's ferry near Gorges point. The cellar of the house he dwelt in re|mains to this day. He went to England in 1643. The people of York say that he returned and died there. If

so it must have been before 1651 or some mention would have been made of him. The Massachusets who, as hath been observed, claimed the province of Main as within the bounds of their charter, took the opportunity of the con|fusions there and encouraged the disposition which pre|vailed in many of the inhabitants to submit to their juris|diction, and in 1651 they appointed Mr. Bradstre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, Major Denison and Capt. Hawthorn to treat with the gentlemen of that province about the surrender thereof as in their best judgment and discretion should seem meet. The next year 1652 Mr. Bradstreet and others were sent commissio|ners to summon the Inhabitants of Kittery to come in and own their subjection to the Massachusets as of right belonging to them. The inhabitants accordingly assembled Nov. 16, and agreed to submit, and about forty inhabitants subscribed an instrument of submission. The like was done at Acamenticus the 22d of the same month, and soon after at Wells, Saco, and Cape Porpoise. To the inhabi|tants of all these plantations larger privileges were granted than to those of the other parts of the Massachusets go|vernment, for they were all freemen upon taking the oath, whereas every where else none could be made free unless he was a church member. The province was made a county by the name of Yorkshire. The towns from that time sent their deputies to the general court at Boston.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This regulation of the province of Main, although the major part of the inhabitants were brought to consent to it, yet it appears by the records which are still preserved in the registry of the county of York, that great opposition was made to it by some of the principal persons, and the government of the Massachusets was severely re|proached by them for using violent compulsory means in order to reduce the province.

VI. or III. on the other, but in October 1651 the court ordered that all pieces of money should have a double ring with this inscription, MASSACHUSETS, and a tree in the center on one side, and NEW ENG|LAND and the year of our Lord on the other side.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The first money being struck in 1652 the same date was continued upon all that was struck for 30 years after, and although there are a great variety of dies it cannot now be determined in what years the pieces were coined. No other colony ever presumed to coin any metal into money. It must be considered that at this time there was no King in Israel. No notice was taken of it by the parliament nor by Cromwell, and having been thus indulged, there was a tacit allowance of it afterwards even by King Charles the 2d. for more than 20 years, and although it was made one of the charges against the colony when the charter was called in ques|tion, yet no great stress was laid upon it. It appeared to have been so beneficial, that during Sir Edmund Andross's administration endeavours were used to obtain leave for continuing it, and the objections against it seem not to have proceeded from its being an encroachment upon the prerogative, for the motion was re|ferred to the master of the mint and the report against it was up|on meer prudential considerations. It is certain that great care was taken to preserve the purity of the coin. I don't find, not|withstanding, that it obtained a currency any where, otherwise than as bullion, except in the New-England colonies. A very large sum was coined. The mint master John Hull raised a large for|tune from it. He was to coin the money, of the just allay of the then new sterling English money, and for all charges which should attend melting refining and coining he was to be allow|ed to take fifteen pence out of every twenty shillings. The court were afterwards sensible that this was too advantageous a contract, and Mr. Hull was offered a sum of money by the court to release them from it but he refused to do it. He left a large personal estate and one of the best real estates in the country. Samuel Sewall who married his only daughter, received with her as was commonly reported, thirty thousand pounds in New-England shillings.

<P>IN October 1651 hostilities began between the English and Dutch in Europe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> The Dutch colony at Manhados was in too feeble a state openly to annoy the English colo|nies their neighbours, and therefore desired to preserve peace in America. The English colonies carried on an advantageous trade with the Dutch, and were for that reason willing to continue friendship, and a correspondence was kept up between the subjects of the two nations. In an address from the general court to Cromwell they consider themselves as at liberty to continue in peace with the Dutch, and suppose their own act to be ne|cessary to bring them into a state of war, notwith|standing the two nations were at war in Europe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix.</NOTE> But in 1653 information was given by the Indians from several
<PB N="180" REF="009705_0095_0F7A45D93071FA40">
quarters that the Dutch governor was privately solliciting them to a general confederacy in order totally to extirpate the English. The massacre at Amboyna was then but a late affair. A general alarm was spread through the co|lonies. An extraordinary meeting of the commissioners was called at Boston April 19,
<Q>to consider of several ru|mours and reports gathered from the Indians and others that the Dutch had plotted with the Indians and stirred them up to cut off the English.</Q>
The result of this first meeting was, that although the evidence was so strong as that some of the commissioners looked upon it to be full proof, yet they thought it most expedient the Dutch go|vernor should have opportunity of making answer; but before any message could be sent, letters were received from him denying all which the Indians or any others had charged him with, wondering the English would give credit to Indian testimonies, and offering to come or send, or to make answer to any deputies which might be sent thither. It was thought proper to send agents to him, viz. Francis Newman, an assistant of New-Haven, John Leveret (afterwards governor of the Massachusets) and William Davis, and in a letter sent by them from the com|missioners the governor was told
<Q>that he had made use of Indian testimonies against New-Haven in a case of land, that Keift his predecessor had done it in a case of life, and that the Dutch governor and council at Amboyna had made a bloody use of the Japoneses confession (though extorted by torture) against Captain Towerson and the English Christians there.</Q>
The commissioners demanded satisfaction for past injuries and security for the future. Whilst their agents were gone they determined what number of men should be raised if God should call them to war against the Dutch, viz. 500,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massachusets 333, Plimouth 60, Connecticut 65, New-Haven 42.</NOTE> and appointed Capt. Leveret the com|manding officer, unless the Massachusets should have some weighty objection against him. Notwithstanding the offers made by the Dutch governor in his letter he refused to submit to any examination into the affair by the agents or
<PB N="181" REF="009705_0095_0F7A45D93071FA40">
commissioners, any further than a committee of his own council should concur with them. They took the testi|mony of divers Indians and others, and returned to Boston. But however strong proofs there were, the commissioners were divided in opinion, and a conference was had before the Massachusets general court and many of the elders. A state of the case was drawn by Mr. Eaton on the one side and another by Mr. Denison on the other, and the elders <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The elders continued to be consulted in every affair of importance as long as the charter continued The share they had in temporal affairs added to the weight they had acquired from their spiritual employments, and they were in high esteem.</NOTE> were desired to draw up their opinion, which was
<Q>That the proofs and presumptions of the execrable plot tending to the destruction of so many of the dear saints of God, imputed to the Dutch governor and the fiscal, were of such weight as to induce them to believe the reality of it, yet they were not so fully conclusive as to clear up a pre|sent proceeding to war before the world, and to bear up their hearts with that fulness of persuasion which was meet in commending the case to God in prayer and to the peo|ple in exhortations, and that it would be safest for the colonies to forbear the use of the sword; but advised to be in a posture of defence and readiness for action until the mind of God should be more clearly known, either for a settled peace or more manifest grounds of war.</Q>
The deputies by their vote expressed a concurrence in senti|ments with the elders. On the 26th of May letters were received from Hartford and New-Haven advising that the Dutch governor was endeavouring, by presents and other methods, to engage the Mohawks and the Indians between Hudson's river and Delaware to fall upon the English. A messenger arrived the same day from Manhados with a long letter from the Dutch governor, complaining of en|croachments and other grievances from the English, and exculpating himself in general terms from any plots or designs against them. The commissioners required fur|ther satisfaction and security from him. Mr. Norice,

presented their sense to the com|missioners in favor of a war, and the commissioners them|selves were all of the same mind, except Mr. Bradstreet, one of the Massachusets commissioners, Mr. Hawthorne the other joining with those of the three other colonies; but their proceedings were interrupted by a declaration sent in by the general court of the Massachusets,
<Q>that no determination of the commissioners, though they should all agree, should bind the general court to join in an offensive war which should appear to such general court to be unjust.</Q>
This declaration occasioned such alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations between the Massachusets general court and the commissioners of the three other colonies at the next meeting as threatned a dissolution of the confederacy, which seems, upon this occasion also, to have been prevented only by the inferiority of the rest to the Massachusets and their inability to stand alone. Where states in alliance are greatly disproportion|ed in strength and importance, power often prevails over right. The government of New-Haven were so sensible of their danger that they sent their agents to England to make a representation of it to Cromwell, who ordered three or four ships with a small number of forces for the reduction of the Dutch, and recommended to the Massa|chusets colony to afford their assistance. The ships were delayed and did not arrive at Boston until the latter end of May or beginning of June 1654. The governor called the assembly, which met the 9th of June, and immediately came into the following resolution:
<Q>The general court having received and perused a letter from his Highness the Lord Protector of the commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, full of great and favorable respect to this colony, which they desire to keep in grateful remembrance and shall be ready at all times, wherein they may with safety to the liberty of their consciences, publick peace and welfare, to their utmost to attend to his Highness's pleasure. This court therefore de|clares, that though they understand that the colony is

not in such a capacity as may be apprehended to send forth such numbers of men as might vigorously assist in that undertaking, yet do freely consent and give liberty to his Highness's commissioners Major Robert Sedgewick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sedgewick had been of the artillery company in London, after|wards lived at Charlestown in New-England, and was the first military officer there and in great repute.

The ships had a very long passage so that the news of the peace with the Dutch, which was signed the 5th of April, prevented their proceeding. This occasioned the commander in chief to turn his forces, together with those raised in the Massa|chusets, another way, and to dislodge the French from Penobscot, St. John's, &amp;c. where they met with no great resistance. It cannot be supposed that this was done with|out instructions from Cromwell.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>The report in New-England was, that Sedgewick had only verbal instructions from some of Oliver's sea commanders, and that this was the reason the country was so easily given up at the treaty of Breda.</P>

passed the last year prohibiting trade with the Dutch was repealed. Stuyvesant the Dutch governor, in these negotiations, conducted himself very artfully. New-Haven and Connecticut were the two colonies with which he was immediately engaged in controversy. He might have been a match for one if not both those colonies, but they were in alliance with the Massachusets. His all depended upon preserving the friendship of that colony. He there|fore kept up a constant correspondence with Mr. Winthrop, and although he would not concede to proposals for a joint trade with the six nations, yet he encouraged trade between the Massachusets and Manhados and, what was more, he as well as his predecessor Kieft made great pretences to religion. Kieft was a serious man. Plimouth fell in with Connec|ticut and New-Haven, and the Massachusets must have done so too if the Dutch had committed any hostilities. Stuyvesant restrained his own people, but at the same time secretly encouraged the Indians to fall upon the English. The Naragansets were numerous, the Maquas or six na|tions were more so. A gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral union of the Indians, which it was supposed he was endeavouring, must have been the ruin of the English colonies; and although it might be expected that when they had rid themselves of the English, the Dutch would be in danger of the same fate, yet this was the least and most remote danger of the two. They were constantly in fear of the English. Their right to any part of the country had never been allowed in England. They were often threatened by the colonists in America, as the Dutch governors mention in their letters. Kieft complains to Winthrop that 'some of the English had said publickly'
<Q>that their countrymen were fools to suffer the Dutch to live there in the center.</Q></P>
<P>THE Massachusets complied with Cromwell's proposal to extirpate the Dutch notwithstanding their former scru|ples of the lawfulness of it. There must have been some other reasons, no doubt those I have mentioned, which caused them to be so backward in joining with the other colonies. They did not foresee what has since happened,
<PB N="185" REF="009705_0097_0F7A45DA24544718">
that the neighbourhood of the colonies of different nations would one time or other engage the powers in Europe in their respective defence and annoyance. Without this they had nothing to fear from either Dutch or French. They were ten times as numerous as both, and continually in|creasing in much greater proportion than either of the other, whose present or future interior force could cause no great apprehensions.</P>
<P>WHILST these disputes with the Dutch were depending the Naraganset Indians made attacks upon the Indians of Long-Island who were under the protection of the English. This together with the conspiracy which Ninigrate the Naraganset Sachem was supposed to be in with the Dutch governor, the commissioners of the English colonies (all but Mr. Bradstreet) thought to be a sufficient ground for making war against the Indians, and came to a resolution in 1653 that 250 men should be forthwith raised in the several colonies, but the Massachusets general court refused to raise their quota. The hostilities between the Indians continuing until 1654, and many upland Indians, as they were called, viz. Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">panoags,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Afterwards called Philip's Indians.</NOTE> Pocanoticko,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Afterwards called Philip's Indians.</NOTE> &amp;c. being collected together, the commissioners sent a messenger to Ninigrate, who soon returned with the following answer, which is here inserted to shew the authority the English assumed at that time over the Indians, and the sense they still retained of their independancy.</P>
<P><Q>JONATHAN GILBERT returned 18 Sept. 1654, and brought Ninigrate's answer in the words following: Having acquainted him that the commissioners were met at Hartford and that they had perused the letter sent to the governor of the Massachusets, he answered he knew nothing of any such letter and made strange of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Concerning his invading the Long-Islanders he an|swered, Wherefore should he acquaint the commissioners when as the Long-Islanders began with him and had slain a Sachem's son and sixty others of his men, and therefore he will not make peace with the Long-Islan|ders,

<P><Q>Concerning the upland Indians his answer was, That they were his friends and came to help him against the Long-Islanders, which had killed several of his men. Wherefore should he acquaint the commissioners with it, he did but right his own quarrel which the Long-I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nders began with him.</Q></P>
<P>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ON the receipt of this answer the commissioners agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to raise forthwith 270 foot and 40 horse out of the several colonies and gave a commission to Major Simon Willard to command them, with instructions

Willard marched with his men into the Naraganset country. Ninigrate with his men had secured themselves in a swamp where it was not thought adviseable to attack them, and the forces returned with no other success than the bring|ing off a number of the Pequods, who had been left with the Naragansets by the English ever since the Pequod war upon the promise of an annual payment for each head. The commander made it a part of his excuse that the instructions to him were equivocal. But the commissioners were offended at this proceeding and charged him with neglecting an opportunity of humbling the pride of Nini|grate, which since the return of the forces was greatly in|creased, and left him to consider what satisfaction was to be expected from him and those of his council who joined With him.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Records of united colonies.</NOTE> It is to be observed that Major Willard was a

<P>THE most remarkable occurrence in the colony in the year 1655 was the trial and condemnation of Mrs. Ann Hibbins for witchcraft.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1655.</NOTE> Her husband who died in the year 1654 was an agent for the colony in England, several years one of the assistants, and a merchant of note in the town of Boston, but losses in the latter part of his life had reduced his estate and increased the natural crabbedness of his wife's temper, which made her turbulent and quarrel|some, and brought her un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er church censures, and at length rendered her so odious to her neighbours as to cause some of them to accuse her of witchcraft. The jury brought her in guilty but the magistrates refused to accept the ver|dict, so the cause came to the general court where the po|pular clamour prevailed against her and the miserable old woman was condemned and executed. Search was made upon her body for tetts and in her chests and boxes for puppets, images, &amp;c. but there is no record of any thing of that sort being found. Mr. Beach a minister in Jam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ica in a letter to Doctor Increase Mather in the year 1684 says,

<P>IT fared with her as it did with Joan of Arc in France.

There was no forfeiture of goods for felony.</NOTE></P>
<P>ABOUT this time, however inconsistent it may seem with the professed ecclesiastical constitution and the freedom of every church, the general court in several instances interposed their authority. They laid a large fine upon the church at Malden for chusing a minister without the consent and approbation of the neighbouring churches and allowance of the magistrates, and soon after, viz. in 1653 they re|strained the north church in Boston from calling Mr. Powell to be their minister, who had the character of a well gifted tho' illiterate man, and went so far as to recommend to them Mr. Reyner who had been a minister at New-Plimouth.</P>
<P><Q>IT was justly observed upon this occasion that let the experience of all reformed churches be consulted and it will appear that disorder and confusion in the church will not be avoided by all the determinations,

His son, grandson, and two of his great grandsons have been since of the council. The latter was of Cambridge and had a great share in managing the public affairs in the most difficult times. He left no male children.</NOTE> During this period the trade of the colony was in a flourishing state, free admission being allowed to all nations, and the vessels of the colony trading to and from France, Holland, and other parts of Europe, the importation of no commodities whatsoever being prohibited, or under any clog or restraint. Notwithstanding the great variety of sectaries in England there had been no divisions of any consequence in the Massachusets, but from 1637 to 1656 they enjoyed, in general, great quietness in their ecclesiastical affairs, discords in particular churches being healed and made up by a submission to the arbitrament of neighbouring churches, and sometimes the interposition of the civil power. The reputation not only of the consti|tution of the churches, but also of the New-England clergy had been for some time very great in England, and the opinions of Mr. Cotton, Hooker, Davenport, and others, are cited as authorities by many English divines. The persecution of the episcopalians by the prevailing powers in England was evidently from revenge for the persecu|tion they had suffered themselves, and from political con|siderations and the prevalence of a party, seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther opinions and professions, however absurd, were tolerated but in New-England it must be confessed that bigotry and cruel zeal prevailed, and to that degree that no opi|nions but their own could be tolerated.

<P>MR. Winslow the agent for the colony in England being dead, Mr. Leveret, one of Cromwell's commissioners in the expedition to Acadie, was appointed in his stead.

Jamaica being conquered, Cromwell renewed his invitation to the colony of the Massachusets to remove and to go and peo|ple that island, and it appears by Mr. Leveret's letters and a letter from the general court to Cromwell that he had it much at heart.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>At my presenting your letter of the first of December 56 to his highness he was pleased to enquire of New-England's condition, and what news as to the business of Jamaica, to which I gave an|swer according to the advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eceived. By his resent thereof to|gether with what I had from him the 18th of November, he mani|festeth a very strong desire in him for some leading and consider|able company of New-England men to go thither; for at that time he was pleased to express, that he did apprehend the people of New-England had as clear a call to transport themselves from thence to Jamaica as they had from England to New-England in order to their bettering their outward condition, God having pro|mised his people should be the head and not the tail, besides that design hath it's tendency to the overthrow of the man of sin, and withal was pleased to add, that though the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eople had been sickly yet it was said to be a climacterical year, that others had been to view the place, as Mevis people who upon liking were gone down, and Christophers people were upon motion, and he hoped by what intelligence he had from Capt. Gookin that some con|siderable numbers would go from New-England. His highness was pleased to hear me in what I objected. As to the bettering our outward condition, though we had not any among us that had to boast, as some particulars in other plantations, of raising themselves to great estates, yet take the body of the people and all things considered, they lived more comfortably like English|men than any of the rest of the plantations; to which his highness replied, that they were more industrious, what then would they be in a better country; to which I added that there were more in New-England produced to bespeak us a commonwealth than in all the English plantations besides, the which his highness granted. I objecting the contrariety of spirits, principles, manners, and cus|toms of the people of New-England to them that were at the island or in any other plantations that could remove thither, so not like to cement, his highness replied that were there consider|able persons that would remove from thence, they should have the government in their hands and be strengthened with the authority of England, who might be capable of giving check to the ill and vicious manners of all. Whilst his highness was pleased to entertain me with these discourses, an honorable gen|tleman of his council came in who hearing his highness upon New-England was pleased to express himself concerning New-England's rigidness and persecution, to which his highness was pleased to answer very much in the favor of them, that they acted like wise men, and God had broken the designs of evil instruments, bearing witness with them against evil seducers which had risen up among them, mentioning one or two; to which that honor|able gentleman replied, the miscarriage of particular persons proved not God's bearing witness against the body of them that withdrew and departed from them for their rigidness; to which, with their favor, I replied, that if Rhode Island and those parts were intended that then God had born witness against them in general as well as against particulars, which would appear by that looseness and profaneness they were left to, so that they had not only declined christian religion but moral observations, to which the honorable gentleman was pleased to wave the credit thereof, and express that if it were so he thought his highness ought to animadvert upon one and the other. Much more passed in dis|course and his highness broke off with this that he would not impose any particular injunction upon me.</Q></P>

Nay Crom|well applauded the colony for banishing the evil seducers which had risen up among them, of which Mr. Wheel|wright and Mrs. Hutchinson were the chief, and probably he had a view to them in particular. This same Mr. Wheel|wright had been several years in England and lived in the neighbourhood of Sir Henry Vane, who had been his pa|tron in New-England and now took great notice of him.

<P>CROMWELL seems to have been the first who had a true sense of the importance of the colonies to their mo|ther country. The expedition to Hispaniola was by him well intended, though by his servants badly executed, and his plan for enlarging the national interest in America no doubt extended further than the conquest of that island. Let us take a view of the state of the colonies at that time. Barbados was then more populous than it is at present. That island and the Caribbees were under the same go|vernment. These with Virginia, Maryland and Bermudas refused to acknowledge the parliament whilst the King lived, and it occasioned some trouble to reduce them after his death. They were all the colonies, except New-Eng|land, which were settled when Cromwell took the govern|ment upon him. There were no less than three different governors over Virginia during his short rule, Digby, Ben|net and Matthews. Barbados surrendered to Sir George Ayscough, upon condition that the government should be by governor council and assembly, and Daniel Searl being appointed their governor continued until the restoration. It was a rash thing to resist the supreme authority in England and gave great offence. Until then, all the colonies had been indulged in a free open trade to and from all parts of the
<PB N="195" REF="009705_0102_0F7A4580C43CA7E0">
world, unless the privileges granted to the East-India company made an exception, but Cromwell obtained an act or ordinance of the parliament prohibiting the plantations from receiving or exporting any European commodities, except in English built ships navigated by Englishmen, and all correspondence was forbidden with any nation or colony not subject to England, and no alien was allowed to set up a factory or carry on a trade in the plantations. Vir|ginia made heavy complaints, that they were not allowed to send off their produce to, nor to import necessaries from, any foreign countries, whilst England alone (they said) could not take off their produce, nor could they at that time be supplied from thence with all things necessary for them. But, however grievous this act might prove to the other colonies, it is certain that those of New-England, whether it was designed to extend there or not, suffered nothing by it. In a letter to Cromwell in 1654 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix.</NOTE> the Mas|sachusets seem to be under fears least they should be de|prived of the privileges which had been indulged to them by his predecessors, and hope his Highness will be no less propitious and will not be displeased with them for asserting their just privileges, to the prejudice whereof some at|tempts had been made by the commanders of ships, espe|cially by some armed with commission, which though for fear of offending they had patiently endured, yet they thought it not safe to approve of such actings, &amp;c. If this letter had respect to any attempts to regulate the trade, they were attempts which were soon given over and caused little or no interruption, and they were not only indulged in their trade to all parts, but that extra|ordinary privilege of having their goods imported into England free from all custom which other subjects were liable to pay, seems to have been continued until the restoration. No wonder if they were envied by the other colonies, and if the merchants in England were dissatisfied also with the continuance of the last mentioned extraor|dinary favor.</P>

Soon after this, as the governor was going from the publick worship on the Lord's day to his own house, several gentlemen accompanying him, Mary Prince called to him from a window of the prison, railing at and reviling him, saying Woe unto thee, thou art an oppressor; and denouncing the judgments of God upon him. Not content with this, she wrote a letter to the governor and magistrates filled with opprobrious stuff. The governor sent for her twice from the prison to his house and took much pains to persuade her to desist from such extrava|gancies. Two of the ministers were present, and with much moderation and tenderness endeavoured to convince her of her errors, to which she returned the grossest rail|ings, reproaching them as hirelings, deceivers of the people, Baal's priests, the seed of the serpent, of the brood of Ishmael and the like.</P>

At this time there was no special provision by law for the punishment of quakers; they came within a colony law against hereticks in general.

They also laid a penalty of five pounds for importing and the like for dispersing quakers books, and severe penalties for defending their heretical opinions. And the next year an additional law was made by which all persons were subjected to the penalty of forty shillings for every hour's entertainment given to any

For these and such like disturbances they might be deemed proper subjects either of a mad-house or house of correction, and it is to be lamented that any greater severities were made use of. After all that may be said against these measures, it evidently appears that they proceeded not from personal hatred and malice against such disordered persons, nor from any private sinister views, as is generally the case with unjust punishments inflicted in times of party rage and discord, whether civil or religious, but meerly from a false zeal and an erro|neous judgment. In support of their proceedings they brought several texts of the old testament.

<P>THAT I may finish what relates to the quakers it must be further observed that their friends in England sollicited and at length obtained an order from the King Sept. 9th 1661, requiring that a stop should be put to all capital or corporal punishment of those of his subjects called quakers, and that such as were obnoxious should be sent to England.

Whatever opinion they might have of the force of orders from the crown controuling the laws of the colony, they prudently complied with this instruction and suspended the execution of the laws against quakers, so far as respected corporal punishment, until further order. Indeed before the receipt of this letter, but probably when they were in expectation of it, all that were in prison were discharged and sent out of the colony. The laws were afterwards re|vived so far as respected vagabond quakers, whose punish|ment was limited to whipping, and, as a further favor, through three towns only. But there was little or no room for carrying the laws into execution, for after these first excursions they became in general an orderly people, submitting to the laws, except such as relate to the militia and the support of the ministry, and in their scruples as to those they have from time to time been indulged. At present, they are esteemed as being of good morals, friend|ly and benevolent in their disposition, and I hope will never meet with any further persecution on account of their peculiar tenets or customs.

The commissioners in their answer let him know, that they had ever conformed to that settlement although he had not, but they said nothing of the Protector's confirmation. It does not appear that ever they sought for it.

of the colony in general, being of a light sandy soil, would have been incapable of supporting its inhabitants were it not for the large bodies of salt meadow, the hay of which serves for fodder for their cattle in the winter, and the dung from it, being an excellent manure, produces good crops of grain with little labor in the summer, light land being easily tilled. The northern parts bordering upon the Massachusets afford many good farms, particularly the town of Bridgewater, which hath been famous for the quality of the land and for good husbandry. They were few at first and but little additions were made after the Massachusets was planted, except from their natural in|crease, and yet before the year 1643, besides the town of Plimouth, they had settled Duxbury, Scituate, Taunton, Rehoboth, Sandwich, Barnstable, Yarmouth, and Eastham. Upon the death of Mr. Carver their first governor soon after their arrival, they chose in his stead Mr. Bradford, being a grave discreet man. They were so well satisfied with his administration that they continued to chuse him annu|ally until his death in 1657, except two years when they chose Mr. Winslow, and one year Mr. Prince.</P>
<P>THEIR ecclesiastical affairs were for divers years in dis|couraging circumstances. They had expectations that Mr. Robinson their pastor, whom they had left with one half his church in Holland, would follow them, but his death in 1624 put an end to their hopes. They were unsuc|cessful in their attempts to settle a minister, the principles of one and the manners of another were exceptionable, and having several brethren among themselves well gifted, they chose to continue without a minister for some time rather than to settle one who was not exemplary in his life, or who differed from them in points of doctrine or church government.

An observation had been taken by Nathanael Woodward in the year 1638 upon part of Charles river 41 degrees 59 minutes north latitude, the river still run|ning southward, the persons employed not being able to proceed farther for want of provisions.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Historical Occurrences from the Restoration of King Charles the Second to the year 1686, when the Charter was vacated.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the year 1640 the people had been without any apprehensions of danger to their religious or civil privileges. They prudently acknowledged subjection to the parliament and afterwards to Cromwell, so far as was necessary to keep upon terms and avoid excep|tion, and no farther. The addresses to the parliament and Cromwell shew this to have been the case. After Cromwell's death, during the frequent changes in the supreme autho|rity in England, they seem to have taken part with none, but to have waited until some settlement was made which should have a prospect of stability.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I find this remark in an ancient manuscript wrote about the year 1665,
<Q>When a packet of letters was sent by Mr. John Thurloe, containing an express order of the council signed by Henry Law|rence president, requiring and enjoining the governor and magi|strates of the Massachusets colony to proclaim Richard in these following terms, that is to say, Lord Protector of the common|wealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the territories thereunto belonging, they did not obey the said order. And since his Majesty King Charles the second was proclaimed in the Massachusets, at Boston and other places, they have not failed in all their courts and judicial proceedings throughout the colony to give that tribute of honor to his Majesty which in such like cases is commonly rendered by the courts of law at Westminster.</Q></NOTE> I have no where met with any marks of disrespect to the memory of the late King, and there is no room to suppose they were under disaffection to his son, and if they feared his restoration it was because they expected a change in religion, and that a persecution of all non-conformists would follow it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They had undoubtedly a good opinion of the persons in whose hands the administration then was, but the uncertainty of their continuance in power was reason enough for caution.</NOTE> At

the election in May, they could have received no intelli|gence from England to enable them to make any certain judgment of affairs. Mr. Endicot was then chosen gover|nor and Mr. Bellingham deputy governor, both of them as fixed in their principles as any of their brethren. The business of this session of the general court went over and nothing passed relative to affairs in England. On the 27th of July Capt. Peirce, a noted shipmaster in the trade be|tween England and the colony, arrived and brought the news of the King's being proclaimed. If they received at the same time the King's declaration from Breda and de|pended that a royal promise would be, as it always ought to be, religiously complied with, they need not have been under great concern about their public affairs either in church or state. No advices were received from autho|rity, and the King was not proclaimed in the colony&punc;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the first instance of the accession of a Prince to the throne since this colony had been planted, and perhaps the propriety and necessity of this ceremony in the plantations was not fully understood and considered. I find nothing said about it until notice taken in England of the neglect.</NOTE> nor was any alteration made in the forms of their public acts and proceedings. There was a session of the general court in October and a motion was made for an address to the King, but it did not succeed. Mr. Norton, one of the ministers of Boston, was very earnest for it, but rumors came by the way of Barbados, that the government in England was in a very unsettled state, the body of the people dissatisfied, that the Scotch had demanded Monk to be delivered up to them, that Lord Fairfax was at the head of a great army, &amp;c. and they had seen so many changes in the course of a few months that they thought it was not very certain that an address to the King would not fall into the hands of a committee of safety, council of state, or a junto with some other title. On the 30th of November a ship arrived from Bristol, which brought advices of the proceedings of parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that all matters were fully settled. They were also informed by letters from Mr. Leveret their agent and others, that
<PB N="211" REF="009705_0110_0F7A4588F6C06B20">
petitions and complaints were preferred against the colony to the King in council, and to the parliament (a citation being posted upon the exchange in London) by Mason, Gorges and others. The governor and assistants met forthwith, called the general court to convene the 19th of December, a very loyal address to the King was presently agreed upon, and another to the two houses of parliament. Letters were sent by Sir Thomas Temple who was a con|stant friend to the colony, to Lord Manchester, Lord Say and Seal, and other persons of note, to pray them to inter|cede in behalf of the colony. A most gracious answer was given to the address, by the King's letter dated Feb. 15. 1660, which was the first public act or order concerning them after the restoration, except a few lines the 23d of January before from secretary Morice, to inclose an order for the apprehending two of the late King's judges, both letters its probable by the same ship, which arrived in May following.</P>
<P>BEFORE the receipt of this letter, the governor and council March 18th took public notice of a book pub|lished by Mr. Eliot not long before, intitled The Christian Commonwealth, &amp;c. which they declare they find on pe|rusal full of seditious principles and notions in relation to all established governments in the christian world, especially against the government established in their native country. Upon consultation with the elders their censure was de|ferred until the general court met,
<Q>that Mr. Eliot might have the opportunity in the mean time of making a pub|lic recantation.</Q></P>
<P>AT the next sessions in May Mr. Eliot gave into the court the following acknowledgment under his hand.</P>

<P>THE books were ordered by the court to be called in and this acknowledgment to be posted up in the principal towns in the colony. When the times change, men gene|rally suffer their opinions to change with them, so far at least as is necessary to avoid danger.

<P>A day of public thanksgiving was appointed by authori|ty, to acknowledge the favor of heaven in inclining the King graciously to accept and answer the address made to him.</P>
<P>THEY were notwithstanding under no small degree of fear, least the revolution of government in England should produce as great a change in the form of their govern|ment, both in church and state. They were alarmed from all quarters. Reports were spread that Virginia and the islands were forbid trading with them, that three frigates would soon be sent from England, and that a general go|vernor over all the colonies was to come in one of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The general vogue of people is that a governor will be sent over, other rumors there are concerning you.

<P>IN the ship which arrived from London the 27th of July there came passengers Col. Whaley and Col. Goffe, two of the late King's judges. Col. Goffe brought testimo|nials from Mr. John Rowe and Mr. Seth Wood, two mini|sters of a church in Westminster. Col. Whaley had been a member of Mr. Thomas Goodwin's church. Goffe kept a journal or diary from the day he left Westminster, May 4. until the year 1667&punc; which together with several other papers belonging to him I have in my possession. Almost the whole is in characters or short hand, not very difficult to decypher. The story of these persons has never yet been published to the world. It has never been known
<PB N="214" REF="009705_0112_0F7A458AF42B2DC8">
in New-England. Their papers after their death were collected and have remained near an hundred years in a library in Boston. It must give some entertainment to the curious. They left London before the King was pro|claimed. It does not appear that they were among the most obnoxious of the judges, but as it was expected ven|geance would be taken of some of them, and a great many h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d fled, they did not think it safe to remain. They did not attempt to conceal their persons or characters when they arrived at Boston, but immediately went to the gover|nor Mr. Endicot, who received them very courteously. They were visited by the principal persons of the town, and among others they take notice of Col. Crown's coming to see them. He was a noted royalist. Although they did not disguise themselves, yet they chose to reside at Cam|bridge, a village about four miles distant from the town, where they went the first day they arrived. They went publickly to meetings on the Lord's days, and to occasional lectures, fasts, and thanksgivings, and were admitted to the sacrament, and attended private meetings for devotion, vi|sited many of the principal towns, and were frequently at Boston, and once when insulted there the person in|sulting them was bound to his good behavior. They appeared grave, serious and devout, and the rank they had sustained commanded respect. Whaley had been one of Cromwell's Lieut. Generals and Goffe a Major-General. It is not strange that they should meet with this favorable reception, nor was this reception any con|tempt of the authority in England. They were known to have been two of the King's judges, but King Charles the second was not proclaimed when the ship that brought them left London. They had the news of it in the channel. The reports afterwards by way of Barbados were that all the judges would be pardoned but seven. The act of indemnity was not brought over until the last of November. When it appeared that they were not ex|cepted, some of the principal persons in the government were alarmed, pity and compassion prevailed with others.
<PB N="215" REF="009705_0112_0F7A458AF42B2DC8">
They had assurances from some that belonged to the general court that they would stand by them, but were advised by others to think of removing. The 22d of February the governor summoned a court of assistants to consult about securing them, but the court did not agree to it. Finding it unsafe to remain any longer they left Cambridge the 26th following and arrived at New-Haven the 7th of March. One Capt. Breedan who had seen them at Boston gave information thereof upon his arrival in England. A few days after their removal, an hue and cry, as they term it in their diary, was brought by the way of Barbados, and thereupon a warrant to secure them issued, the 8th of March, from the governor and assistants, which was sent to Springfield and the other towns in the western parts of the colony, but they were beyond the reach it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>They were well treated at New-Haven by the ministers and some of the magistrates, and for some days seem'd to apprehend them|selves out of danger. But the news of the King's proclamation being brought to New-Haven, they were obliged to abscond. The 27th of March they removed to Milford, and appeared there in the day time and made themselves known, but at night returned privately to New-Haven and lay concealed in Mr. Davenport the minister's house until the 30th of April. About that time, news came to Boston that ten of the judges were executed, and the go|vernor received a royal mandate dated March 5. 1660, to cause Whaley and Goffe to be secured. This greatly alarmed the coun|try, and there is no doubt that the court were now in earnest in their endeavours to apprehend them; and to avoid all suspicion they gave commission and instructions to two young merchants from England, Thomas Kellond and Thomas Kirk, zealous royalists, to go through the colonies as far as Manhados in search of them. They had friends who informed them what was doing, and they removed from Mr. Davenport's to the house of one Jones, where they lay hid until the 11th of May, and then removed to a mill, and from thence on the 13th into the woods where they met Jones and two of his companions, Sperry and Burrill, who first conducted them to a place called hatchet-harbour, where they lay two nights, until a cave or hole in the side of a hill was pre|pared to conceal them. This hill they called Providence hill, and there they continued from the 15th of May to the 11th of June, sometimes in the cave, and in very tempestuous weather in a house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear to it. During this time the messengers went through New-Haven to the Dutch settlement, from whence they returned to Boston by water. They made diligent search and had full proof that the regicides had been seen at Mr. Davenport's, and offered great rewards to English and Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns who should give informa|tion that they might be taken, but by the fidelity of their three friends they remained undiscovered. Mr. Davenport was threat|ned with being called to an account for concealing and comfort|ing traitors, and might well be alarmed. They had engaged to surrender rather than the country or any particular persons should suffer upon their account, and upon intimation of Mr. Davenport's danger, they generously resolved to go to New-Haven and deliver themselves up to the authority there. The miseries they had suffered and were still exposed to, and the little chance they had of finally escaping in a country where every stranger is immediately known to be such, would not have been sufficient to have induced them. They let the deputy governor Mr. Leete know where they were, but he took no measures to secure them, and the next day some persons came to them to advise them not to surrender. Having publickly shewn themselves at New-Haven, they had cleared Mr. Davenport from the suspicion of still concealing them, and the 24th of June went into the woods again to their cave. They continued there, sometimes venturing to a house near the cave, until the 19th of August, when the search for them being pretty well over, they ventured to the house of one Tomkins near Milford, where they remained two years, with|out so much as going into the orchard. After that, they took a little more liberty and made themselves known to several persons in whom they could confide, and each of them frequently prayed and also exercised, as they term it, or preached at private meet|ings in their chamber. In 1664 the commissioners from King Charles arrived at Boston. Upon the news of it they retired to their cave where they tarried 8 or 10 days. Soon after, some Indians in their hunting discovered the cave with the bed, &amp;c. and the report being spread abroad, it was not safe to remain near it. On the 13th of October 1664 they removed to Hadley, near an hundred miles distant, travelling only by night, where Mr. Russell the minister of the place had previously agreed to receive them. Here they remained concealed fifteen or sixteen years, very few persons in the colony being privy to it. The last ac|count of Goffe is from a letter dated Ebenezer, the name they gave their several places of abode, April 2d, 1679. Whaley had been dead some time before. The tradition at Hadley is, that two persons unknown were buried in the minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r's cellar. The minister was no sufferer by his boarders. They received more or less remittances every year, for many y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs together, from their wives in England. Those few persons who knew where they were, made them frequent presents. Richard Saltonstall <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was in the secret, when he left the country and went to England in 1672 made them a present of fifty pounds at his departure, and they take notice of donations from several other friends. They were in constant terror, though they had reason to hope, after some years, that the enquiry for them was over. They read with pleasure the news of their being killed with other judges in Switzerland. Their diary for six or seven years contains every little occurrent in the town, church and par|ticular families in the neighbourhood. These were small affairs. They had indeed for a few years of their lives been among the principal actors in the great affairs of the nation, Goffe especially who turned the members of the little parliament out of the house, and who was attached to Oliver and to Richard to the last; but they were both of low birth and education. They had very constant and exact intelligence of every thing which passed in Eng|land and were unwilling to give up all hopes of deliverance. Their greatest expectations were from the fulfilment of the pro|phecies. They had no doubt that the execution of the judges was the slaying of the witnesses. They were much disapppointed when the year 1666 had passed without any remarkable event, but flattered themselves that the christian aera might be erroneous. Their lives were miserable and constant burdens. They complain of being banished from all human s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iety. A letter from Goffe's wife, who was Whaley's daughte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; I think worth preserving. (Appendix.) After the second year Goffe writes by the name of Walter Goldsmith and she of Frances Goldsmith, and the corre|spondence is carried on as between a mother and son. There is too much religion in their letters for the taste of the present day, but the distresses of two persons under these peculiar circum|stances, who appear to have lived very happily together, are very strongly described.</P>
<P>Whilst they were at Hadley (Feb. 10. 1664) Dixwell another of the judges came to them, but from whence, or in what part of Ame|rica he first landed, is not known. The first mention of him in their journal is by the name of Col. Dixwell, but ever after they call him Mr. Davids. He continued some years at Hadley and then removed to New-Haven. He was generally supposed to have been one of those who were obnoxious in England, but he never discovered who he was until he was on his death-bed. I have one of his letters signed James Davids, dated March 23d 1683. He married at New-Haven and left several children. After his death his son, who before had been called Davids, took the name of Dixwell, came to Boston and lived in good repute, was a ruling elder of one of the churches there and died in 1721 of the small-pox by inoculation. Some of his grandchildren are now living. Col. Dixwell was buried at New-Haven. His grave stone still remains with this inscription.
<Q>J. D. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> deceased March 18th, in the 82d year of his age 1688.</Q></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that many of the principal persons in the colony greatly esteemed these persons for their professions of piety and their grave deportment, who did not approve of their political conduct. Mr. Mitchell the minister of Cambridge, who shewed them great friendship upon their first arrival, says in a manuscript which he wrote in his own vindication,
<Q>Since I have had op|portunity by reading and discourse to look a little into that action for which these men suffer I could never see that it was justifiable.</Q>
After they were declared traitors they certainly would have been sent to England if they could have been taken. It was generally thought they had left the country; and even the consequence of their escape was dreaded, least when they were taken those who had harboured them should suffer for it. Mr. Endicot the gover|nor writes to the Earl of Manchester, that he supposes they went towards the Dutch at Manhadoes and took shipping for Holland, and Mr. Bradstreet the then governor in December 1684, writes to Edward Randolph,
<Q>that after their being at New-Haven he could never hear what became of them.</Q>
Randolph who was sent to search into the secrets of the government could obtain no more knowledge of them than that they had been in the country and respect had been shewn them by some of the magistrates. I am loth to omit an anecdote handed down thro' governor Leveret's family. I find Goffe takes notice in his journal of Leveret's being at Hadley. The town of Hadley was alarmed by the Indians in 1675 in the time of publick worship and the people were in the ut|most confusion. Suddenly, a grave elderly person appeared in the midst of them. In his mein and dress he differed from the rest of the people. He not only encouraged them to defend themselves but put himself at their head, rallied, instructed and led them on to encounter the enemy, who by this means were repulsed. As suddenly, the deliverer of Hadley disappeared. The people were left in consternation, utterly unable to account for this strange phoenomenon. It is not probable that they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ever able to ex|plain it. If Goffe had been then discovered, it must have come to the knowledge of those persons who declare by their letters that they never knew what became of him.</P></NOTE></P>

His Majesty's gracious pardon to all his subjects was likewise declared for all treasons, &amp;c. during the late troubles, except to such as stood attainted by act of parliament, if any such should have transported themselves thither; but then it was required that all their laws should be reviewed, and such as were contrary or derogatory to the King's authority and government should be annulled and repealed, that the oath of allegiance should be duly administred, that the administration of justice should be in the King's name, that freedom and liberty should be given to all such as desired to use the book of common prayer and perform their devotions in the manner esta|blished in England and that they might not undergo any

<P><Q><P>Doctor Mather says upon this occasion,
<Q>Such has been the jea|lous disposition of our New-Englanders about their dearly bought privileges, and such also has been the various understanding of the people about the extent of those privileges, that of all the a|gents which they have sent over unto the court of England for now forty years together, I know not any one who did not at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> return meet with some very froward entertainment among his countrymen.

<P>THE year 1662 was remarkable for a synod or general council of all the churches, held at Boston in the month of September, by order of the general court.</P>
<P>THE two questions referred to their decision, and con|cerning which the country was much divided in sentiment, were these,</P>
<P N="1">1st. WHO are the subjects of Baptism?</P>
<P N="2">2d. WHETHER according to the word of God there ought to be a consociation of churches, and what should be the manner of it?</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="009705_0117_0F7A458FEBDEA2F8">THE result of this synod was printed by order of the general court, and is particularly mentioned by Doctor Mather, Mr. Neal and other writers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It being part of the result of this synod that the children of such as made a public profession of their faith, &amp;c. although not in full communion, might be admitted to baptism, several of the members dissented. Mr. Chauncey the president of the college, and Mr. Davenport of New-Haven opposed it in print. Mr. Allen answered the first, and Mr. Richard Mather the other. His son Mr. Increase Mather, a young gentleman about three and twenty, was with the dissenters. He writes Mr. Davenport October 21, 1662,
<Q>I have your writings still in my hands. I offered the synod to read them, but Mr. Norton advised them not to suffer me&punc; whereupon I let them have a copy of them which was generally transcribed. I have given in yours and Mr. Street's testimony unto the general court, with a preface subscribed by Mr. Chaun|cey, Mr. Mayo, my brother, and my self, in the name of others of the dissenting brethren in the synod, wherein we declare that we fully concur with what is inserted by yourself in those papers. Some of the court would fain have thrown them out without reading, but the major part were not so violent. It was moved they might be printed. All the answer we could get was that we might do as we would. We count it a favour we were not commanded to be silent.&mdash;You may see which way things are like to be carried.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Eleazer Mather of Northampton writes to Mr. Davenport of New-Haven 4th of 5th month 1662,
<Q>There was scarce any of the congregational principles but what were layen at by some or other of the assembly; as relations of the work of grace, power of voting of the fraternity in admission, profession of faith and repentance not to be required of such as were bap|tized in the church, in reference to the baptism of their children. Mr. Parker of Newbury was one of the great antagonists of the congregational way and order, though it not being the work of the present synod, his many motions to consider whether we were in the right ecclesiastical order were not attended.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>JOHN TOUTON a French doctor and inhabitant of Rochel in France, made application to the court in behalf of himself and other protestants expelled from their habi|tations on account of their religion, that they might have liberty to inhabit here, which was readily granted to them.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Breedan who as we have before mentioned had been in England and had complained of the govern|ment for harbouring regicides, and had laid divers other
<PB N="225" REF="009705_0117_0F7A458FEBDEA2F8">
things to its charge to render it obnoxious, returned to New-England this year and behaved with great inso|lence in the face of the court, usurping authority and lay|ing his commands on them, but he soon found they had not lost their spirit. They committed him to prison for his contemptuous carriage, and afterwards fined him two hundred pounds, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Afterwards upon application from Sir Thomas Temple seconded by governor Winthrop of Connecticut, the fine was remitted or granted to Sir Thomas Temple to be disposed of at his pleasure.</NOTE> and ordered that he become bound in two hundred pounds with sureties, to be of good behavior, standing committed until sentence be performed. On the other hand Isaac Cole the constable of Woburn being charged with having refused to publish the King's letter, and Edward Converse one of the selectmen of that town, with having spoken disrespectfully of it, as tending to pope|ry, process was ordered against them and they were held to answer for a high misdemeanor, but the facts charged against them not being proved they were acquitted.</P>
<P>THE severe acts of parliament against nonconformists caused some of them again to think of a place of refuge. Several ministers came over, and more intended to follow, but New-England was threatned with a loss of their privi|leges, and if the threat had been executed they would not have been secure in these remote parts.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Here is come with Woodgreene one Mr. Davies a rich merchant, and there came with him one Mr. Allen a young man, a very able teacher recommended by Mr. Goodwin.

Oliver, and others in 1668, for favor to Thomas Gold and the rest, but it gave offence, and some of the petitioners were obliged to acknowledge their fault, some expressions in the petition being construed reproachful, and the chief promoters were fined. Mr. Increase Mather writes to his brother at Northampton July 3d 1665,
<Q>In this town is lately congregated a church of anabaptists. They take advantage from the commissioners who declared that they would have liberty given to all sorts and sects of men.</Q></NOTE> in opposition to the order of the churches of Christ in the colony, and intermeddling with those holy appointments of the Lord Jesus which are pro|per only to office trust.</Q>
They confessed they had joined in a church society, that they had been rebaptized, and that one of them administred the Lord's supper. They were admonished and threatned that if they continued to meet and practice contrary to the order of the gospel the court would proceed against them according to their de|merits. They persevered notwithstanding, and were sen|tenced by the court to be disfranchised, if they were freemen, and if they still continued their practice to be committed to prison upon conviction before one magistrate, until the general court should take further order, and some time after they were imprisoned and banished. <HI>Niti|mur in vetitum</HI> was verified in this proceeding, as it usually is in the like cases. Severity made converts, and then it was thought adviseable to cease from further prosecutions.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q><P>This was not the first appearance of antipaedobaptism in the colony. Mr. Dunstar the president of the college made profession of it and was forced to quit his presidentship. Mr. Chauncey his successor held immersion necessary, but was content that the ordinance should be administred to infants provided it was done in that way. In Mr. Hooker's time soon after the year 1640, it appears by his letters that many were inclined that way, and he expresses his apprehensions that the number would increase.
<Q>In 1644 one Painter for refusing to let his child be baptised (his wife desiring it) was brought before the court, where he declared their baptism to be antichristian. He was sentenced to be whipped, which he bore without flinching, and boasted that God had assisted him. His neighbours gave him the character of an idle lying fellow.</Q></P>

The baptists in England were distinguished at this time into three divisions.
<Q>Such as look upon all who had not been baptized after they came to adult age as little bet|ter than heathens, and will not join in prayer with the most eminent congregational ministers, if they were pro|videntially in a family together. Others are sober mode|rate men and manifest the power of godliness in their conversations, and these upon our occasional meetings we join hand in heart with, and call some of them out to pray with us, and we would not have this difference in judgment between us make the least breach in affection, for many of those we look upon to be eminent precious holy men. We have a third sort, but they are not many (and most of them at London) that take into fellowship those that are godly and desire to join with them, though they come not up to be baptized, and walk lovingly to|gether.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Westgate's letter to Mr. Increase Mather.</NOTE> The first baptists in the Massachusets are represented by the writers of that day to have been of the same principles with those first described.

<P>FROM the restoration until the vacating the charter the colony never stood well in England, the principal persons both in church and state were never without fear|ful expectations of being deprived of their privileges.

To which Cartwright replied
<Q>that the motion was so reasonable that he that would not attend to it was a traitor.</Q>
This was rough usage and could have no good consequences. The commissioners sent letters in their own name about the country to invite the people to assemble.</P>

<HEAD>His Majesties commissioners propositions to Plimouth jurisdiction.</HEAD>
<P>WE were comaunded particularly to recomend these thinges to you from his Majestye.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all householders inhabitinge in your colonye take the oath of allegiance. And that your administrations of justice be in his Majestyes name.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all men of compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent estates and civill conversation, though of different judgment, may be admitted to be freemen, and haue liberty to choose and be choosen officers both civill and military.</P>
<P N="3">3. That all men and woemen of orthodoxe opinions, competent estates, knowledge, civill liues and not scandalous, may be ad|mitted to the sacrament of the Lord's supper, and their children to baptisme [if they desire it] either by admittinge them into the congregation already gathered, or permittinge them to gather themselves into such congregations, where they may enjoy benfitt of the sacrament, and that difference in opinion may not breake the bonds of peace and charity.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all lawes and expressions in lawes derogatory to his Majesty, if any such haue beene made in these partes in the laite trouble|some tymes, may be repealed, altered and taken off from the file.</P>
<P>The Courts answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the first we consent, it haueing been the practise of this court in the first place to insart in the oath of fidelity, required of every householder, to be true and loyall to our soveraigne Lord the King, his heires and successors: alsoe to administer all actes of justice in his Majestyes name.</P>
<P N="2">2. To the second we alsoe consent, it haueing beene our constant practise to admitt men of competent estates, and civill conversa|tion, though of different judgments, yet beinge otherwise ortho|doxe, to be freemen, and to haue liberty to choose and to be choosen officers both civill and military.</P>
<P N="4">4. To the 4th we consent that all lawes and expressions of lawes derogatory to his Majestye, [if any such be found amongst us, which at present we are not conscious of] shall be repealed, altered and taken off the file.</P>
<P N="3">3. To the 3d, we cannot but acknowledge it to be a high favour from God and from our Soveraigne that we may enjoy our con|sciences in point of God's worship, the main end of transplanting ourselves into these remote corners of the earth, and should most heartily rejoice that all our neighbours, so qualified as in that proposition, would adjoine themselves to our societies according to the order of the gospel, for the enjoyment of the sacraments to them|selves and theirs; but if thr&ocirc; different perswasions respecting church government it cannot be obtained, we would not deny a liberty to any according to the proposition that are truly conscientious, alth&ocirc; differing from us (especially where his Majestye commands it) they maintaining an able preaching ministry for carrying on of publick sabbath worship, which we doubt not is his Majesties intent, and withdraw not from paying their due proportions of maintenance to such ministers as are orderly settled in the places where they live, until they have one of their owne, and that in such places as are capable of maintaining the worship of God in two distinct congregations. We being greatly incouraged by his Majesties gracious expressions in his letter to us and your honours further assurance of his royal purpose to continue our liberties, that where places by reason of our paucity and poverty are unca|pable of two, it is not intended that such congregations as are already in being should be rooted out, but their liberties pre|served, there being other places to accommodate men of different perswasions in societies by themselves, which by our knowne ex|perience tends most to the preservation of peace and charity.</P>
<P>The league between the 4 colonies was not with any intent (that ever we heard of) to cast off our dependance upon England, a thing which we utterly abhorre; intreating your honours to believe us, for we speak as in the presence of God.</P>

of April, and so prevented, designedly as was supposed, that respect which was intended to have been shewn them at their arrival. Mr. Endicot the governor died the 15th of March 1665. Mr. Bellingham the deputy governor with some of the magistrates assembled, as usual, the 2d of May, the day before the election, to prepare for the busi|ness of the next day. The commissioners desired to speak with them, which though at first they refused, being no court, yet when it was urged by the commissioners, it was submitted to. Five writings were delivered as part of their instructions. The first expressing
<Q>the great kind|ness of the King for the colony and his desire to advance a plantation which had given so good an example of sobriety and industry to all others.</Q></P>
<P>THE second declaring
<Q>that the King was so far from any thought of abridging that he was very ready to enlarge all the concessions made by his royal father in the charter, or to make any alterations for the prosperity of the colony.</Q></P>
<P>THE third
<Q>that the principal end of their journey was to remove all jealousies the King might have of the loyalty and affections of his good subjects towards him, or which they might have of his good opinion and confidence in them and his protection over them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="009705_0123_0F7A45943678AFD8">THE fourth
<Q>that by this means the designs of wicked and seditious persons would be disappointed, and a founda|tion laid for mutual confidence and satisfaction, the King would look upon his colony of the Massachusets within the same limits of affection, duty and obedience to his person and government as Kent or Yorkshire, and they again would have the same confidence of his care and protection as the others had, and all have great reason to acknowledge the good effects which by God's blessing would proceed from this commission.</Q>
These were given as from his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE fifth was a message of their own,
<Q>assuring the council in his Majesty's name that whatever had been granted by his royal predecessor or promised by himself should to the utmost be made good, and desiring they might have no just cause to represent to his Majesty any thing which might seem to come short of that just duty and allegiance which might merit his Majesty's favor.</Q>
They then acquainted the council with the favorable re|presentation they had made to his Majesty of the readiness of the colony to have assisted in the expedition against the Dutch, if it had been necessary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Smith in his history of New-York says that Col. Nicolls and Sir George Carterett in their letter to the secretary of state com|plain much of the backwardness of the Massachusets. Two hundred men its certain were raised and ready to march with great expedition.</NOTE></P>
<P>BEFORE there was an opportunity for an answer they acquainted the deputy governor and the rest with two other instructions, one
<Q>for publishing the letters which had been sent to the King with the answers to them,</Q>
the other
<Q>for laying before the commissioners a map or plan of the colony, that they might hear and determine all claims made by such as bordered upon it.</Q>
They also complained of slanderous reports about the country that they were come to raise a revenue of &pound;.5000 a year for the King, to lay 12<HI>d.</HI> per acre annual rent on all improved lands, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="009705_0123_0F7A45943678AFD8">ASSOON as the election was over, viz. on the 4th of May, these matters were laid, by the governor, before the general court. The commissioners were immediately de|sired to communicate to the court the whole which his Majesty had given in command to declare to them, that so they might have their whole work before them, but they replied, that they would not observe that method, but when they had an answer to what they had given in they would then present them with more work. The refusal itself was not so displeasing as the terms and manner in which it was expressed and delivered.</P>
<P>THE 5th the court gave their answer in substance as follows, reserving liberty to enlarge afterwards if there should be cause, viz.</P>
<P><Q>THAT they acknowledged with all humble thanks his Majesty's grace and favor in his letters and messages, and they would lay hold of every opportunity to shew their duty and loyalty to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT what relates to the Dutch being fully accom|plished no further answer could be expected, only an ac|knowledgment of the favorable representation which the commissioners had made of the conduct of the court.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AS to a map of the colony, it was preparing and they should soon have satisfaction therein.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT his Majes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y's letters had been laid before the court, and so had the papers received from the commissio|ners, and copies were spread about the country, and if the commissioners desired any further publication they would endeavour their satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT they were willing to advise with the commis|sioners upon the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of putting a stop to all false ru|mors, and finally that their confidence of his Majesty's grace and favor and royal intentions to them, being further cherished by the commissioners, would undoubtedly draw from them more ample expressions and demonstrations of duty loyalty and good affection to his Majesty, according as by their patent they were bound.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="009705_0124_0F7A4595706D3F50">TO this answer the commissioners replied,</P>
<P>THAT to the preface
<Q>they desired the court to im|prove the liberty reserved of enlarging, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>TO the first head
<Q>that the opportunity they seemed so willing to lay hold of was now brought to their hands.</Q></P>
<P>TO the second
<Q>that nothing further was necessary.</Q></P>
<P>TO the third
<Q>that many things of great moment could not be issued until a perfect map was had.</Q></P>
<P>TO the fourth
<Q>that they would not aggravate any neglect, but they hoped the general court by practical as|sertions of duty would give his Majesty satisfaction upon the points contained in the letter of 1662, which had so long slept in some hands.</Q></P>
<P>TO the fifth
<Q>they were fully persuaded the printing the results and conclusions which should be made on his Majesty's part, and the part of the colony, would silence all those false and malicious reports which they expected should be enquired into.</Q></P>
<P>TO the conclusion
<Q>that altho' their patent laid them under peculiar obligation, yet it did not circumscribe all that duty and allegiance which was due to his Majesty from natural born subjects, and which they themselves in former papers had more fully expressed.</Q></P>
<P>THE same day the commissioners communicated other parts of their instructions, viz.</P>
<P><Q>THAT they should inform themselves of the state of the neighbouring Indian Princes, and enquire what treaties had been made between them and any of the King's sub|jects, and if there had been any failure on the part of any of his Majesty's subjects, the commissioners should take ef|fectual course that reparation and satisfaction be made for any injury sustained thereby, and use all ways and means to let those Princes and other Indians know of his Majesty's charge, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE commissioners informed the court of great com|plaints received from the Naraganset Indians, and desired to be advised how they should attain a true information that they might do justice and give the King a just account. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="009705_0124_0F7A4595706D3F50">
<Q>THAT they should make due inquiry, what progress had been towards the foundation and maintenance of any college or schools for the education of youth and conver|sion of infidels, the King having taken abundant satisfaction in the accounts he had received of the designs of the colo|ny herein, which he hoped would draw a blessing upon all their other undertakings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT they should not give too easy an ear to clamors or accusations against such as then were, or had been, in places of government, except from men of equal condition, and then they should proceed to examine and determine, according to the rules of justice, without respect of persons or opinions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT they should not receive any complaints against a magistrate, except for something done against equity or against the charter, nor interrupt the course of justice be|tween party and party, except the proceedings should be expresly contrary to the rules prescribed by the charter, or the matter in difference arose from some expression or clause in some grant under the great seal. In those cases to examine and proceed according to justice.</Q></P>
<P>UPON the subject of this instruction the commissioners acquainted the court
<Q>they had received ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y complaints from the English of hard measure in several kinds&punc; one more especially, which they offered to communicate, and dared not refuse to examine it, but had so much respect to the authority in the several colonies that they would leave it to the choice of the court whether it should be heard at Providence in Rhode Island, or at Boston, either at that time, or after the commissioners return from the eastward where they were going.</Q>
This referred to a criminal prosecution against one John Porter, jun. to whom they had granted a warrant of protection as it was termed.</P>
<P><Q>THAT in due season they should inquire how far the particulars required by the King's letter of 1662 had been complied with,</Q>
as first,</P>
<P><Q>THAT all persons take the oath of allegiance.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="240" REF="009705_0125_0F7A4595D4E4BD58">2d,
<Q>THAT all process, and administration of justice be performed in our name.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3d,
<Q>THAT such as desire to use the book of commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prayer, be permitted so to do without incurring any penal|ty, reproach, or disadvantage, it being very scandalous that any persons should be debarred the exercise of their reli|gion according to the laws and customs of England, by those who were indulged with the liberty of being of what profession or religion they pleased.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4th,
<Q>THAT persons of good and honest conversation might enjoy the privilege, of chusing and being chose in|to places of government and the like.</Q></P>
<P>THE commissioners desired they might be enabled to give the King such information as should be fully satisfactory.</P>
<P>THE 8th of May they delivered three other writing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s parts of their instructions, viz.</P>
<P><Q>THAT they should duly inquire whether any person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> attainted of high treason now reside there, or have been entertained there and by whom, and what is become of them, and endeavour to cause them to be apprehended and sent to England.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT they should take care that such orders be established as that the act of navigation be punctually ob|served, it being of infinite co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cernment and what the hearts of the whole nation were set upon, but had been evaded, under pretence that acts made in the assembly there during the late rebellion, were in force notwithstanding the act of parliament, an assertion the King would not suffer to be made, but that all such acts of assembly should be re|pealed, taken off the files, and no more rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n upon record; and that they should cause justice to be done to Thomas Dean who had been denied it in a prosecution upon the act of parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THE commissioners desired a book of the colony law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that they might examine, &amp;c. and that any laws contrary to this act might be declared null.</P>
<P><Q>THAT they should inform themselves of the whole frame and constitution of government, civil and ecclesiasti|cal,
<PB N="241" REF="009705_0125_0F7A4595D4E4BD58">
the yearly taxes and impositions, the shipping, the militia, horse and foot, fortified towns and forts, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THEY desired some persons might be appointed to draw up an information of all those particulars to satisfy his Majesty's desires.</P>
<P>BEFORE the court gave answer to these papers they sent a message, May 9th, to the commissioners to acquaint them that the court apprehended their patent to be greatly infringed by the warrant granted to John Porter, upon which the commissioners desired a conference with a com|mittee, that the court might have better information, which was agreed to and held the 11th.</P>
<P>THE commissioners asserted that they were to be justi|fied by their commission in what they did, and that the charter was not infringed. The committee urged
<Q>that the general court had full power and authority to make laws and provide for the execution of them; they were very ready to give an account to his Majesty of all their proceedings whensoever he required it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut it would be an insuperable burden, if the colony must be brought upon a level, and stand with every criminal upon whom sentence had been passed, at the bar of another tribunal which their charter knew nothing of.</Q>
The commissioners being asked
<Q>whether they proposed a jury should pass upon these and the like cases? they replied no, theirs was a commission of oyer and terminer. Whether they would admit of new evidence? yea.</Q>
The committee then further urged
<Q>That they esteemed it their greatest unhappiness to be held to give up their privileges by charter, and the rights of Englishmen, or else be accounted among such as denied his Majesty's authority.</Q>
The commissioners nevertheless insisted upon their own authority, and required a submission to it. The court then proceeded to give answer to the other instructions which had been communicated.</P>
<P>TO that which relates to the Indians, called the 5th instruction, they say
<Q>that they have been too long ac|quainte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the falsehood of the Naraganset and other Indians to wonder that they should complain of injuries
<PB N="242" REF="009705_0126_0F7A4596AAD09628">
when they themselves were the aggressors; that all matter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> relating to the Indians had been managed by the com|missioners of the united colonies, and their records might be examined.</Q></P>
<P>TO the next or sixth instruction,
<Q>That there is a small college at Cambridge, from which they might say without boasting more than an hundred able preachers, physicians, and other useful persons had issued; for the particulars of the foundation and benefactions they referred to the president and fellows; that the country was well provided with schools, that there was also at Cambridge a small fabrick of brick for the use of the Indians, built by the corporation in England, in which there were then eight Indian scholars, one of which had been admitted into college, that there were six towns of Indians in the juris|diction professing the christian religion, that they had schools to teach the youth to read and write, and persons appointed to instruct them in civility and religion, who had orders to wait upon the commissioners and shew them the towns and manner of life of the Indians, if it should be desired.</Q></P>
<P>TO the proposition upon the 7th and 8th instructions, by which an offer is made of the choice of a place for hearing and determining complaints, they say
<Q>that hear|ing and determining appeals from their judgments is in|consistent with their charter; nevertheless as they desired to be doers of truth and righteousness, and not to shun the light, if the commissioners would be pleased to impart the complaints that had been brought against the govern|ment, they hoped to be able to give such answer as should satisfy his Majesty that their actions had been consonant to reason and equity, and not such as evil minded men had represented them.</Q></P>
<P>TO the ninth touching his Majesty's letter of June 1662, they say
<Q>that they had endeavoured formerly to satisfy his Majesty's expectations, &amp;c. and now further say, touching the oath of allegiance, that in August last the court by a publick declaration expressed their resolution,
<PB N="243" REF="009705_0126_0F7A4596AAD09628">
God assisting, to bear faith and true allegiance to his Ma|jesty, and to adhere to their patent the duties and privi|leges thereof, that many now in authority and also many of the common people had taken the oath of allegiance be|fore they left their native country, and they had ordered that the oath in the form prescribed by the colony law should be taken by all freemen and all other housholders.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oath was in this form.
<Q>Whereas I A. B. am an inhabitant within this jurisdiction, considering how I stand obliged to the King's Majesty, his heirs and successors by our charter and the government established thereby, do swear accordingly by the great and dreadful name of the ever living God, that I will bear faith and true allegiance to our sovereign Lord the King his heirs and successors. So help me God.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><Q>AND touching civil liberties they observed the quali|fications mentioned in his Majesty's letter <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orthodox in religion and not vicious in their lives.</NOTE> orderly evi|denced to them <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">By certificate from the minister.</NOTE> as appear'd by their late law and practice thereupon.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AND as to ecclesiastical privileges they had commended to the ministry and people here the word of the Lord for their rule.</Q></P>
<P>TO the next or tenth instruction.
<Q>That they knew of no persons attainted of high treason who had arrived here, except Mr. Whaley and Mr. Gosse, and they before the act of parliament, and they departed this jurisdiction the February following, and a proclamation against them coming soon after by way of Barbados, the court sent two gentlemen, Mr. Kellond and Mr. Kirke, after them to Con|necticut and New-Haven to apprehend them.</Q></P>
<P>TO the eleventh instruction they say,
<Q>The act for trade had been for some years observed here, that they had been misrepresented to his Majesty, the act not having in any instances that they knew of been greatly violated, and such laws as appeared to be against it were repealed, and that justice had been done in the case of Thomas Dean, as they would find upon enquiry.</Q></P>
<P>TO the twelfth,
<Q>For the form of their constitution they refer to their patent, the annual ordinary charges of
<PB N="244" REF="009705_0127_0F7A459733F9B9A0">
government were about &pound;.1200, for their ecclesiastical constitution they had none imposed by civil authority, all that was enjoined by that, was attendance on publick wor|ship on Lord's days and other occasional days. The people who maintained, also chose their mininsters, whose admini|strations were known and they hoped consonant to the word of God, and if any deviated in such case they made use of a synod and the civil authority. The militia consisted of about four thousand foot and four hundred horse, more might be in the lists, but aged and infirm were excused. They had a fort or keep at the entrance of Boston harbour with five or six guns, two batteries in the harbour, and one at Charlestown. The number of their ships and vessels as follows, about eighty from 20 to 40 tons, about forty from 40 to 100 tons, and about a dozen ships above 100 tons.</Q></P>
<P>THESE papers were delivered to the commissioners on the 16th of May, and on the 18th they made their reply.</P>
<P><Q>THEY were sorry to find by the court's answer to the 7th and 8th instruction that they put more value upon their own conceptions, than the wisdom of the King in interpret|ing the charter. The commissioners would reduce all the discourses upon this head to one question. Do you ac|knowledge his Majesty's commission wherein we are nomi|nated commissioners, to be of full force to all the pur|poses therein contained?</Q></P>
<P>TO their answer to the 9th instruction the commissioners reply,
<Q>That the court had been so far from endeavouring to give his Majesty satisfaction, by observing what he re|quired, that they had even complained of his Majesty for enjoining them, and for the commission given to enquire whether they had observed them or not, that they pro|fessed highly to prize the King's favor, and yet in the same paper refuse to do what the King required, viz. that all who came into the colony should take the oath of allegiance, making provisoes not expressed in their charter, and so curtailing the oath. That the end of the first planters coming over, as the court expressed in their ad|dress
<PB N="245" REF="009705_0127_0F7A459733F9B9A0">
1660, was liberty of conscience, and yet it was denied to those for whom the King required it. That they had tentered the King's qualifications for freemen, by suffering none to be made such who were not church members, unless they paid ten shillings to a single rate, which not one church member in a hundred did pay, and although they commend the word of the Lord to the ministry and people for their rule, yet it was with a proviso that they have the approbation of the court. The commissioners supposed the King and his council and the church of Eng|land understood the word of God as well as the Massachu|sets corporation. They feared these answers would highly offend the King, and advised to an ingenuous and free consent to what he desired.</Q></P>
<P>ON the 19th of May, the court by a message to the commissioners desired to be excused from a direct answer to the question
<Q>whether they acknowledged his Majesty's commission,</Q>
&amp;c. and chose rather to plead his Majesty charter and his special charge to the commissioners not to disturb them in the enjoyment of it; they were ready to give such an account of their proceedings as that the commissioners might be able to represent their per|sons and actions to his Majesty.</P>
<P>THE commissioners by a message on the 20th, insisted on a direct answer to their question, and on the 22d, the court declared, that it was enough for them to give their sense of the powers granted to them by charter, and that it was beyond their line to determine the power, intent or purpose of his Majesty's commission.</P>
<P>ON the 23d the commissioners informed the court, that since they had been pleased to send them a more dubious answer than the former, that they might discharge their duty to his Majesty they intended to sit to-morrow morn|ing at the house of Capt. Thomas Breading as his Ma|jesty's commissioners, to hear and determine the cause of Mr. Thomas Dean and others, against the governor and company and Joshua Scottow merchant, defendants, and that they thought proper to give this notice and expected

</LETTER>
<P>THE commissioners, at the same time, laid before the court proposals for amendments or alterations of the laws to the number of twenty six.</P>
<P>THE court, the same day, acquainted the commissioners that they should be ready, by writing or conference, when|ever the commissioners pleased, to lay before them the grounds and reasons of their claim and exercise of juris|diction in the eastern country, that so his Majesty might be satisfied of the true state of the controversy, and that as
<PB N="249" REF="009705_0129_0F7A459AE0740B60">
his Majesty had directed his commissioners to examine in|to the proceedings in the case of Thomas Dean and cause justice to be done, the court had summoned the said Dean before them, at nine of the clock the next day, to make out the truth of his complaint to his Majesty, and the commis|sioners were desired to be present that they might under|stand the grounds of the said complaint and that justice may be done.</P>
<P>THE commissioners replied the 26th, "that they could not have imagined that the court after interruption of the authority committed by his Majesty to the commissioners would have assumed to themselves the hearing of the same case wherein the governor and company are impleaded, it being unheard of and contrary to all the laws of christen|dom that the same persons should be judges and parties, and declared it contrary to his Majesty's will and pleasure that the cause should be examined by any other person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than themselves.</P>
<P>THE commissioners broke off from any further con|ference and all, except Colonel Nichols, went to New-Hampshire and the province of Main, where they appoint|ed justices of the peace and exercised divers acts of govern|ment, and then returned to Boston. The court declared that their proceedings at the eastward tended to the dis|turbance of the publick peace, and desired a conference with them concerning their doings there, but received such an answer from Sir Robert Carr as determined them to put a stop to all further treaty. He told them, amongst other things, that the King's pardon to them for all their deed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> during the late rebellion was conditional, and depended upon their future good behavior, and threatened the lea|ders or contrivers of their measures with the punishment which so many concerned in the rebellion had met with in England. They had no better success at Connecticut than in the Massachusets colony. At Plimouth and Rhode-Island they met with less opposition. They sat as a court at Providence and Warwick in the colony of Rhode-Island, and spent divers months in the

<P>COL. NICHOLS, by his discreet behavior, gained the esteem of the people, and afterwards, whilst he was gover|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or of New-York, kept up a friendly correspondence with the governor and company of the Massachusets. Carr and Cartwright were men very unfit for such a trust, and by their violent proceedings rendered themselves odious. Maverick seems to have been appointed only to increase the number and to be subservient to the others. He had lived in the colony from its beginning. He was alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in opposition to the authority. Upon the restoration h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> went home to complain to the King, was two or three years solliciting that commissioners might be appointed; at length the measures against the Dutch at New-York being agreed upon, the conduct of that affair and this ex|traordinary power was committed to the same persons. He was in the colony again in 1667 with a message from Col. Nichols, which is the last account given of him. Sir Robert Carr went first to Delaware and soon after home to England, and died at Bristol June 1st 1667, the day after he landed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morton's Memorial.</NOTE> Cartwright in his passage was taken by the Dutch, stripped and very ill used. He had taken the minutes of all their proceedings, and went home th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> most enraged; but the enemy took all his papers from him and he never could recover them. The principal per|sons in the colony were afraid of further proceedings. Captain Gookins one of the assistants writes to his friend in 1666,
<Q>In all probability a new cloud is gathering and a new storm preparing for us, which we expect every day.</Q></P>
<P>THE government of the colony I imagine will not be thought culpable for refusing entirely to submit to the absolute authority of the commissioners, which must have
<PB N="251" REF="009705_0130_0F7A459B0C9A0B30">
superseded their charter, and if this authority had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> once admitted they would have found it very difficult ever after to have ejected it. Some part of their conduct may appear extraordinary; particularly their refusing to make the oath of allegiance necessary, unless with restriction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and limitations, and to cause all proceedings at law to be more expressly in his Majesty's name and by his authority. From some original manuscripts, which discover the senti|ments of some persons of influence amongst them upon the nature of civil subjection, their conduct in this and some former instances may be pretty well accounted for.</P>
<P>THEY distinguished civil subjection into necessary and voluntary. From actual residence within any government necessarily arose subjection, or an obligation to submit to the laws and authority thereof. But birth was no necessary cause of subjection. The subjects of any prince or state had a natural right to remove to any other state, or to an|other quarter of the world, unless the state was weakned and exposed by such remove, and even in that case, if they were deprived of the right of all mankind, liberty of con|science, it would justify a separation, and upon their re|moval their subjection determined and ceased. The country to which they themselves had removed was claimed and possessed by independent princes, whose right to the lord|ship and sovereignty thereof had been acknowledged by the Kings of England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Bartholomew Sharp the buccaneer was tried in England for robbery and piracy upon the Spaniards in South-America and acquitted because he had a commission from the Indian Princes of Darien.</P>

in the sight of God and men, they had no right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> title to what they possessed. The King indeed, in imita|tion of other Princes of Europe who laid claim to coun|tries meerly from the discovery of them, had granted this country to certain of his subjects, and the first planter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought it proper to purchase the title of such grantees, to prevent molestation from them or from other states, and they had also received a charter of incorporation from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> King, containing a mutual compact, from whence arose a new kind of subjection, to which they were held and from which they would never depart.</P>
<P>THIS was what they called voluntary civil subjection arising meerly from compact, and from thence it followed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t whatsoever could be brought into question relative to their subjection must be determined by their charter. The compact between the King and the city of London, as con|tained in it's charter, was not the constituting caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of sub|jection in the inhabitants there, because they were resident, and from thence necessary subjection remained, but when residence the sole grounds of this necessary subjection ceases, then it become voluntary and depends upon compact alone. By this compact they acknowledged they were so bound, that they were not at liberty to subject themselves to, or to seek protection from any other prince, they were to pay a fifth part of all silver and gold mines, they were to make no laws repugnant to the laws of England; &amp;c. but on the other hand they were to be governed by laws made by themselves, and by officers elected by themselves, &amp;c. But however pleasing these principles were in speculation, or whatever foundation they may have in nature, yet they could not continue to practice upon them, nor would they bear the test when adopted by English subjects. In a short time, as we shall see hereafter, they were content fully to comply with the oath of allegiance without qualifying it, and to give up other points which they had before insisted upon, and their posterity, who claim by birthright as well as charter the peculiar privileges of Englishmen, and who enjoy the protection, are very sensible that they likewise owe

Another con|stable, who had been at the tavern before, had been beaten by them. Mason who had more courage and zeal, went into the company with his staff, and told them he was glad to see them there, for if he had found them on the other side the street he would have carried them all away, and ad|ded, that he wondered they should be so uncivil as to beat a constable and abuse authority. Sir Robert Carr said it was he that beat him and that he would do it again. Ma|son replied, that he thought his Majesty's commissioners would not have beaten his Majesty's officers, and that it was well for them that he was not the constable who found them there, for he would have carried them before autho|rity. Sir Robert asked if he dare meddle with the King's commissioners. Yes&punc; says Mason, and if the King himself had been there I would have carried him away; upon which Maverick cried out, treason! Mason, thou shalt be hanged within a twelvemonth. Sir Robert Carr spake to Sir Thomas Temple and some others of the company, to take notice of what passed, and the next day Maverick sent a note to Mr. Bellingham the governor, charging Mason with high treason for the words spoken, and requiring the governor to secure him. The governor appointed a time for Maverick to come to his house and to oblige himself to prosecute the constable at the next court of assistants, but Maverick, instead of appearing, thought proper only to send another note, promising to appear against the constable and charge him home, and therefore required his person should be secured. The governor thought it adviseable to cause Mason to recognize, as principal, in five hundred pounds, with two sufficient sureties in two hun|dred

and fifty each, for his appearance; but the day before the court, Maverick sent another note to the governor, desiring to withdraw his charge, being
<Q>satisfied that altho' the words were rash and inconsiderate, yet there was no premeditated design in Mason to offer any injury to the King or his government.</Q>
The governor returned for an|swer,
<Q>the affair was of too high a nature for him to inter|pose in, Mason being bound over to answer.</Q>
Upon his appearance a bill was laid before the grand jury, wherein he was charged with maliciously and treasonably uttering the treasonable words mentioned. According to the li|berty taken by grand juries at that day, they only found "that the words charged were spoken," and Mason being brought upon trial and the words fully proved, the court of assistants suspended judgment, and referred the cause to the next general court, where it was resolved, that although the words were rash, insolent, and highly offen|sive, yet, as his accusers and witnesses all cleared him from any overt act, or evil intended against the King, the court did not see cause to adjudge him a capital offender, but sentenced him to be admonished in solemn manner by the governor.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sup.

<P>I HAVE endeavoured impartially to relate the pro|ceedings between the commissioners and the colony. On the one hand, I think it appears that the government had not sufficient excuse for not complying more fully with what the King required of them by his letter in 1662. Mr. Norton their agent, who knew the resolutions of the King and his ministers, saw the necessity of it. Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would probably have prevented such a commission from issuing. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the commission was a stretch of power, superseding in many respects the authority and powers granted by the charter, and there appears in the conduct of the general court, upon this occasion, not an obstinate perverse spirit, but a modest steady adherence to what they imagined, at least, to be their just rights and privileges.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The King having recommended, by a letter Feb. 22d 1665, to the governor and council, an expedition against Canada, the court in their answer to Lord Arlington.

About two hundred and fifty of the in|habitants of St. Christophers, which had been taken by the French, arriving in the spring of 1666, and more being daily expected, provision was made by the court for the relief and support of such as were in necessity. Upon the news of the great fire in London a collection was made through the colony for the relief of sufferers. The a|mount of it cannot be ascertained. I have a letter from Mr. Seaman and other dissenting ministers in London, to Mr. Syms and Mr. Shephard ministers of Charlestown, advising the receipt of &pound;.105 sterling collected in that church. If others contributed in proportion, a large sum must have been raised.</P>
<P>THERE had been a press for printing at Cambridge for near twenty years. The court appointed two persons <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Capt. Daniel Gookins and Mr. Jonathan Mitchell the minister of Cambridge.</NOTE> in October 1662 licencers of the press, and prohibited the publishing any books or papers which should not be super|vised by them, and in 1668 the supervisors having allowed of the printing "Thomas a Kempis de imitatione Christi,"

the court interposed,
<Q>it being wrote by a popish minister, and containing some things less safe to be infused among the people,</Q>
and therefore they commended to the licen|cers a more full revisal, and ordered the press to stop in the mean time. In a constitution less popular this would have been thought too great an abridgment of the sub|ject's liberty.</P>

The only inconvenience the Massachusets complained of, until after the revolution, was the encou|ragement given to the Indians to make their inroads upon the frontiers. Sir Thomas Temple who, with others, had a grant of the country first from Cromwell, and after|wards from King Charles, thought he had reason to com|plain, and the King's order was repeated to him to give up his forts to the French, some pretence being made for not complying with the first order.</P>

I am now (by God's good hand) vickar of Ware, and desire your best di|rection how I may with most profit and edification of my charge proceed in the Lord's work. I have a very large parish and a dissolute town to deal with (as you may well guess) and which is worse, we have little government in the place to assist us. The people have wanted instruction for many years (such I mean as might build them up in the faith and make them wise unto sal|vation) besides, the places round about me are a barren wilderness, and so must undergo much opposition. I have already sustained <HI>aliqua gravamina conscientiae,</HI> to go thus far in regard to the government and discipline of our church, and am likely to undergo more in the book of articles, which we are bound to read publicly and to yield our assent unto; the article concerning the ordination of bishops and ministers doth somewhat trouble me, as also the ceremonies which we are bound unto, which though I forbear myself, yet I know not how to avoid but that my curate must use if I will stand here. I pray afford your wisest advice herein. <HI>Haec sub sigillo.</HI></P>
<P>I shall be glad to see you at my poor vickarage, <HI>in tronsitu.</HI> and for my part (if God permit) I will not fail to see you once a year. I pray salute Mr. Johnson and Mr. Bellingham with their wives in my name, and the rest of my christian friends in your town or family, and I beseech you remember me unto the Lord in your prayers, and the Lord give a blessing to your person and labors.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your's in the Lord with all hearty affection, Charles Chauncy."</SIGNED>

Besides these, we are not to omit Jonathan Mitchell the minister of Cambridge, who died the 9th of July 1668, in his 43d year, and is always spoken of as one of the most learned men and best preachers in his day. Mr. Daven|port, who had been minister of New-Haven from the first settlement of that colony, removed to Boston about the year 1667, to the great grief of his people, and against the mind of many of the principal persons of the church in Boston, which caused them, some time after, to separate from their brethren, and to form a new society ever since known by the name of the south church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Thomas Thacher was the first minister of this church, and Mr. Rainsford brother to Lord Chief Justice Rainsford, was the first ruling elder.</NOTE> He died of the palsie March 16th 1670, in the 73d year of his age.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In 1667 the people at Cape Fear, being under distressing circum|stances, a general contribution by order of court was made thro' the colony for their relief.

<P>MR. Gorges's claim to the province of Main, supported by the acts of the commissioners, had encouraged the peo|ple to withdraw from their subjection to the Massachusets, but the province, according to some accounts, was in the utmost confusion, and in 1668 some of the principal per|sons applied to the general court of the Massachusets to reassume the jurisdiction over them. The court always thought it the part of good governors, as well as of good judges, to amplify their jurisdiction, and from a sense of their duty to God and the King published a declaration,
<PB N="261" REF="009705_0135_0F7A459EB46796A0">
requiring the inhabitants of the county of York to yield obedience to the laws of the colony, and to chuse officers within the several towns as they had done before the late interruption. As this proceeding was made one of the grounds of complaint against the colony, a more particular account of it may not be improper.</P>
<P>THE declaration of the court was of the form following.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS this colony of the Massachusets in ob|servance of the trust to them committed by his Majesty's royal charter, with the full and free consent and submission of the inhabitants of the county of York, for sundry years did exercise government over the people of that county, and whereas about three years now past, some interruption hath been made to the peace of that place and order there established, by the imposition of some who pretending to serve his Majesty's interest with unjust aspersions and reflections upon this government here established by his royal charter, have unwarrantably drawn the inhabitants of that county to submission unto officers that have no royal warranty, thereby infringing the liberty of our charter and depriving the people now settled of their just privileges, the effect whereof doth now appear to be, not only a disservice to his Majesty, but also the reducing a people that were found under an orderly establishment to a confused anarchy: The premises being duly considered, this court doth judge meet, as in duty they stand bound to God and his Ma|jesty, to declare their resolution again to exert their power of jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the said county of York, and do hereby accordingly, in his Ma|jesty's name, require all and every of the inhabitants there settled, to yield obedience to the laws of this colony as they have been orderly published, and to all such officer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as shall be there legally established by authority of his Majesty's royal charter and the order of our commis|sioners, whom this court hath nominated and impowered to settle all affairs necessary for the government of the people there, and to keep a court this present summer

<LETTER>
<P><Q>UPON receipt of this courts commission which is recorded in the last session&punc; we presently appointed Peter Wyer clerk of the writs, and hearing Masterson, appoint|ed by the court, was imprisoned, we appointed another marshal, by warrant under our hands, but the former marshal being set at liberty the other did not act. The court being by law to be kept in York the first Tuesday of July 1668, being the 7th day of the month, we re|paired to York upon Monday the 6th day. Mr. Jocelin and several others stiled justices of the peace, coming nigh to the ordinary where we were before the door, after salutes passed, they told us they desired to speak with us in the morning. To their desires we complied and gave them a meeting, where we acquainted them
<PB N="263" REF="009705_0136_0F7A459F75B724F8">
we were ready to hear what they had to say, but not as sent to treat with them about what we had to do by virtue of the general court's commission. They acquainted us that they had lately received, in a pacque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Col. Nichols, his letter to the governor and magi|strates of the Massachusets colony, which they desired us to read, and first their commission, the which we read, and having read them, we told them that those concerned the general court and had been under their consideration, all but the letter from Col. Nichols, and that they had sent their declaration into the county, so that we had nothing to say, only that we did not un|derstand that the commissioners had power to make any such temporary settlement, his Majesty having before him the case, for that the Massachusets had in obedience sent their reasons why they did not deliver up the go|vernment of that country to Mr. Gorges, which was according to his Majesty's command. Then Mr. Jocelin told us there was not above five or six of a town for us; to which we replied, we should see by the returns made to the court's warrants and appearances, and further told them we must attend our commission, in prosecution whereof we should attend his Majesty's and the coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry's service, not our own, and if we met with opposition we should advise what to do. Many other things passed, but with mutual respect. They said they must at|tend their commission. We parted and repaired to the meeting-house, and there opened the court by read|ing our commission publicly and declaring to the people wherefore we came, whereto there was great silence and attention. Then by the marshal we called for the town returns to be brought in for the election of associates,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The associates seem to be intended in the room of magistrates, and being joined with persons appointed by the general court had the same power as the court of magistrates or assistants had in the colony.</NOTE> and returns were made from five towns, the other two being hindred (as they said) by the justices, yet in one of them above half the electors sent in their votes.
<PB N="264" REF="009705_0137_0F7A45A11B56FE30">
Whilst the court was busy in opening, sorting and telling the votes, the justices came, and without doors, by some instrument, made proclamation that all should attend to hear his Majesty's commands, upon which orders were given to the marshal, and accordingly he made procla|mation, that if any had any command from his Majesty, they coming and shewing it to the court, the court was open and ready to hear the same. Thereupon these gentlemen came in and manifested their desire that what they had shewn to us in private might be read in court to the people; to whom we replied, that the court was in the midst of their business in opening the returns of the county from the several towns of election, and so soon as that was over, and after dinner, they should have their desire granted; so they left us, and we proceeded to see who were chosen associates, had the returns of the jurymen and their names entred, both the grand jury and that of trials, also of the consta|bles, but did not swear any one, but adjourned the court and went to dinner; in which time we heard that the gentlemen were going to the meeting-house to sit as an assembly, they having before issued out their warrants for the towns to send their deputies, whereupon we sent to speak with them after dinner. They r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">turned they would, provided we would not proceed any further till we spake with them. We sent them word we did en|gage it. They sent us word they would meet with us at the meeting-house, and presently after their marshal and Nathaniel Phillips went up and down, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at all public places published a paper or writing, whom meet|ing upon their return, it was demanded what, and upon what authority, they had published to the people to make a disturbance, they answered, they published what they had in the King's name; they were demanded to shew their order or authority; they answered, that was for their security; so refusing to shew it they were com|mitted to the marshal. Then we went to court, where we found the house full and the gentlemen to have taken
<PB N="265" REF="009705_0137_0F7A45A11B56FE30">
up our seats, so room being made, we went up to them and told them we expected other things than that they would have put such an affront upon the court, nor should motions hinder us from prosecuting our commis|sion; we could keep the court elsewhere. Some of the people began to speak, but we commanded silence, and the officer was commanded by us to clear the court, where|upon Mr. Jocelin spake to some nigh him to depart; so they coming from their seat we came to private discourse&punc; and they insisted to have their commission and the King's mandamus of 1666 to be read; we told them we would perform what we had promised when the court was set, so we repaired to our seat, and they being set by us desired that their commission might be read, which was done, and the grounds of it expressed to be from the people's petitioning, who were told that they could best give answer thereto, but said nothing; then that part of the mandamus of 1666 which they desired might be read, was read. After which they desired that Colonel Nichols's letter to the governor and magistrates of the Massachusets might be read, but that not being of con|cernment to them there, save only for information of the justices of what had passed from him to the governor and magistrates to whom it was directed, it was refused; some short account being publicly given, that that which had been read, for the matter, having been before under the consideration of the general court, they had the de|claration of their intendments, in prosecution whereof we were commissionated to keep court and settle the country, which work we had begun and, God willing&punc; would prosecute, to perform the trust committed to us, and have declared to the people that we were not insen|sible how that at the time of the interruption of the go|vernment, in the year 1665, by such of the gentlemen of the King's commissioners as were then upon the place&punc; they had manifested their displeasure by telling the peo|ple that the Massachusets were traitors, rebels, and diso|bedient to his Majesty, the reward whereof, within one

year, they said, should be retributed, yet we told them&punc; that through the good hand of God and the King's favor the Massachusets were an authority to assert their right of government there, by virtue of the royal charter derived to them from his Majesty's royal predecessors, and that we did not doubt but that the Massachusets colony's actings for the forwarding his Majesty's service, would outspeak others words, where there was nothing but words for themselves or against us. Which done, the gentlemen left us, and we proceeded to the work of the court, to impannel the grand jury, gave them their oaths and charge, and then the associates present we called to take their oaths, one of them, viz. Mr. Roger Plaisted, ex|pressed publicly that he was sent by the town he lived in, accordingly he had applied himself to the major-general more privately, to know how we reassumed the government, and how they were to submit to it, which he now mentioned in public that he might render him|self faithful to them that sent him; to which he was answered in public as he had been in private, that we reassumed the government by virtue of the charter, and that they were to have the like privileges with ourselves in the other counties. We had also from Scarborough a paper presented, which we herewith present to the court. Then having sworn the constables present, im|pannelled the jury for trials, sworn them, and committed what actions were entred and prosecuted to them, in which time the gentlemen sent to desire that at our leisure time they might speak with us; they were sent for and presented us with a paper. After we had re|ceived it, we attended to settle the business of the mili|tary officers and trained bands, and commissionated for York, Job Alcock lieutenant, Arthur Bragdon ensign, for Wells John Littlefield lieutenant, Francis Littlefield jun. ensign, for Scarborough Andrew Augur lieutenant, for Falmouth George Ingerfield lieutenant, for Kittery Charles Frost captain, Roger Plaisted lieutenant, John Gaffingsley ensign, for Saco Bryan Pendleton major, and he

<PB N="268" REF="009705_0139_0F7A45A5B01D5E18">
as an act of greater force and violence. Indeed, he do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> not pretend that there was any opposition made by the in|habitants, but only by the particular persons appointed by the commissioners to govern there, and it always appeared to be the desire of a great part of the people to live under the government of the Massachusets.</P>
<P>THE people of New Hampshire had continued in a quiet and orderly state ever since the year 1641. There was no person who had any pretence to the powers of government. Mason having only a grant of the soil from the council of Plimouth, but Sir Ferdinando Gorges received a royal char|ter, granting the same royalties, privileges and franchises as are of right or ought to be enjoyed by the bishop of Dur|ham, in the county palatine of Durham, with power to con|stitute a deputy governor, a chancellor, a treasurer, a marshal, a judge of admiralty, officers of admiralty for ordering ma|ritime affairs, master of ordnance, a secretary, &amp;c. and by repeatedly nominating some such officers and attempting to establish a form of government consisting of different per|sons from those appointed by the Massachusets, there were always two different parties and interests kept alive in that province. New-Hampshire had been so long united to the Massachusets that the people of both colonies were of one heart and mind in civil and religious affairs. The town of Portsmouth shewed an instance of their great re|gard to the public interest, and in 1669 made a collection, as it is termed in the instrument presented to the general court, more probably a subscription, of sixty pounds per annum, for the term of seven years, for the use of Har|vard college, to be paid into the hands of the overseers,

The report made by the commissioners to the King had produced no further troubles from Eng|land. The plague, the fire of London, the discontents among the people of England, caused by their jealousies of a design to subvert the constitution there, may well e|nough be supposed to have been the cause of a respite in favor of the people here. The Massachusets governed without opposition the province of New-Hampshire and province of Main, and were beginning settlements even further eastward. The French were removed from their neighbourhood on the one side, and the Dutch and Swedes on the other. Their trade was as extensive as they could wish. No custom-house was established. The acts of parliament of the 12th and 15th of King Charles the second, for regulating the plantation trade, were in force, but the governor, whose business it was to carry them into execution, was annually to be elected by the people, whose interest it was that they should not be observed. Some of the magistrates and principal merchants grew very rich,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Josselyn, p. 180.</NOTE> and a spirit of industry and oeconomy prevailed through the colony. But a change of affairs came on soon after.</P>
<P>MR. Bellingham continued governor in 1671 and 1672.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1671. to 1673.</NOTE><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bellingham died December 7th, 1672. He lived to be the only surviving patentee named in the charter. It is always men|tioned as a part of his character, that he hated a bribe. He was bred a lawyer, but, like some much greater lawyers, made his last will and testament in such a manner, that after some years dis|pute, the general court thought it necessary to supply the defects of it, by making a disposition of his estate themselves. Mr. Leveret was among the junior assistants, but he had been long employed in public affairs and places of great trust. Oliver Cromwell had made him one of his commissioners in 1654, for the reduction of the Manhadoes. He was in England at the restoration and ap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared an advocate for the colony.

governor, when Mr. Samuel Symonds was chosen deputy governor.</P>
<P>THE strict union, which had been from the be|ginning between the civil and ecclesiastical parts of the constitution, was about this time in danger of being broke, or greatly weakned. After Mr. Wilson's death, the first church in Boston invited Mr. Davenport, the minister of New-Haven, to succeed him. He was then about 70, had gone into the wilderness with persons closely attached to him, and remained with them about 30 years, and they were extremely averse to his leaving them; and besides, he was at the head of a party more strict and rigid than the body of the people of the country, for he had always opposed the admitting to baptism the children of any who were not in full communion with one or other of the churches. It is not strange that there should have been a party of Boston church which opposed his settlement. The two parties in this church, the first in rank (although the church of Salem was the oldest) in the country, pro|duced two parties, not in the other churches only, but in the state also. A considerable part of the church, both for number and estate, formed themselves, as has been ob|served, into a separate society. Seventeen ministers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Allin, John Higginson, John Ward, John Wilson, Edmund Browne, Samuel Whiting senior, Thomas Cobbet, John Sherman, Samuel Phillips, Thomas Shepard, Increase Mather, Samuel Torrey, Zechary Symmes, John Brocke, Edward Bulkley, Samuel Whiting junior, John Hale.</NOTE> bore a public testimony against the proceedings of the three elders<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. John Davenport, Mr. James Allen, and the ruling elder James Penn.</NOTE> of the first church in Boston, viz. against Mr. Davenport
<PB N="271" REF="009705_0140_0F7A45A72D508278">
for leaving his church at New-Haven, contrary to his pro|fessed principles, and against all of them for communicating parcels only of letters from the church of New-Haven to the church in Boston, by which artifice the church was deceived, and made to believe the church of New-Haven consented to his dismission, when if the whole had been read, it would have appeared they did not. This testimo|ny was sent to the elders the day before a public fast. An answer was given, in which the elders deny that the letters concealed would have been evidence of the refusal of the church of New-Haven to consent to Mr. Daven|port's leaving them and settling at Boston, the church was only unwilling to make his dismission their immediate act. Neither the church of New-Haven nor the elders of the church of Boston can be wholly justified. There does not seem to have been that fairness and simplic t in their proceedings which the gospel requires. The first church refused the invitation of the new society to join with other churches in ordaining their officers, &amp;c. The mi|nisters and members of churches in the colony were en|gaged, some on one side and some on the other, and the contentions were sharp;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before this, viz. in July 1669, a council had been called by Mr. Bellingham the governor, fearing, as he says in the order,
<Q>a sudden tumult, some persons attempting to set up an edifice for public worship, which was apprehended by authority to be de|trimental to the public peace.</Q>
Mr. Bellingham, its evident, was warmly engaged against the seceders, but the council thought it best not to interpose, and if any person had offended against the laws they advised to proceed against them in a due course of law. They judged it meet to declare
<Q>that it was the duty of those who were about to erect a new meeting-house to observe the laws and orders of the general court for regulating prudential affairs. &amp;c. and if they did not they should have no countenance of authority in their proceedings.</Q></NOTE> at length the house of deputies espoused the cause of the first church, and having at their session in May 1670 appointed a committee to enquire into the prevailing evils which had procured or been the cause of the displeasure of God against the land, they reported, among other causes, these that follow, viz.
<PB N="272" REF="009705_0141_0F7A45A7DBC35878">
<Q>Declension from the primitive foundation work, inno|vation in doctrine and worship, opinion and practice, an invasion of the rights, liberties and privileges of churches, an usurpation of a lordly and prelatical power over God's heritage, a subversion of gospel order, and all this with a dangerous tendency to the utter devasta|tion of these churches, turning the pleasant gardens of Christ into a wilderness, and the inevitable and total extirpation of the principles and pillars of the congre|gational way; these are the leaven, the corrupting gan|grene, the infecting spreading plague, the provoking image of jealousy set up before the Lord, the accursed thing which hath provoked divine wrath, and doth fur|ther threaten destruction.</Q>
They then take notice of the late transaction of churches and elders in constituting the third church in Boston, as irregular, illegal, and disorderly.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Flint, the minister of Dorchester in his diary, whilst this court was sitting, has this observation:
<Q>A spirit of division&punc; persecuting and oppressing God's ministers and precious saints, is the sin which is unseen and none bears witness against. It is a great sin and threatens a sword of divine wrath. God's seers fear it, and their bowels and compassions are moved at it.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>SEVERAL of the ministers at the next session of the general court presented a petition or address, acknow|ledging the great goodness of God in favoring the land for so long a time with a godly and able magistracy, and desiring that it might also be remembered that the people were led forth into this wilderness not only
<Q>by the hands of Moses, but also of Aaron, viz. that reverend ministry which had transported the ark of the covenant, the pre|sence of God in his ordinances settled in gospel order.</Q>
This being premised they solemnly professed that they still adhered to the safe and sober principles of the congrega|tional way, in opposition to separation, morellian or anar|chical confusion and licentious toleration. This profession they made, to vindicate their integrity and innocency from the unjust charge of innovation and loud cry of apostacy laid upon the generality of the ministry, heightened by the
<PB N="273" REF="009705_0141_0F7A45A7DBC35878">
reports of the committee chosen by the house of deputies in their last session, and the votes of the major part of the house. They go on and say, that
<Q>this charge evidently appears to be the transports of a party, by instancing the business of the third church, and so designing to hinder the consummation of that work of God, in the peaceable settlement thereof in actual and full communion with other churches, and by misrepresenting that weighty and wor|thy transaction, before inquiry had been made into the state of the case. These things were matters of great grievance, inasmuch as an antiministerial spirit had thereby been strengthened and emboldened, the hearts and hands of those who labored in the ministry weakened, the spirits of many being filled with groundless jealousies and suspicions against the ministrations of the elders. They made this humble representation in hopes of redress, either by being called upon publicly to vindicate themselves, or by the court's moving for a general convention of churches by their elders and messengers, for the decision of questions and accommodation of differences, or by such other means and measures as to the wisdom of the court should seem meet.</Q>

<P>THE court took this address into their immediate con|sideration, and having first asserted their own authority, and that the acts of the court were not liable to question by any, and that free debates were the indubitable right of the court, they then acknowledged, that in an hour of temp|tation such acts may pass in one court as may, according to principles of religion, prudence and state interest, be re|viewed, and upon mature deliberation be rectified in another; and in the case then under consideration the court thought it their duty to declare, that several expressions in the votes referred to in the petition appeared exceptionable; and, that the court might remove all just grounds of grievance in

the hearts of the reverend elders, and that their ministry might not be made ineffectual by that antiministerial spirit that too much ran through the country, it was ordered that all papers referring to the case should be accounted useless, and not be improved against the reverend elders, as having been the cause of God's displeasure against the country; and whereas many had taken upon them to publish the secrets of the court in that case, the court further dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared, that they knew no just cause of those scandalizing reflections indefinitely cast upon magistrates, elders and churches, either in reference to the new church in Boston or otherwise, and therefore, until they were further informed, they judged them to be innocent, calum|niated and misrepresented.

<P>I HAVE been more particular in relating this transaction, because it gives us a pretty good idea of the connection be|tween the civil and ecclesiastical power, the churches, not|withstanding their claim to independency, being liable to controul as oft as their proceedings were disapproved by the civil magistrate, and on the other hand, the ma|gistrates, who were annually elected, being sometimes liable to be displaced by the influence of the clergy in elections, when their proceedings were supposed to bear hard upon the liberties of the churches, for the clergy still retained a great proportion of the weight they had at the begin|ning. Indeed parishes were multiplied in the colony, many of them small, and in new settlements. The stipends to the ministers were lessened, and soon after this time some of them complained, as many curates do in England, "that they prophecied in sackcloth." Notwithstanding

<P>THE war with the Indians, commonly called Philip's war, endangered the very being of the colony, and it was a question with some, whether the Indians would not prevail to a total extirpation of the English inhabitants. At the first arrival of the English, the Indians were treat|ed with kindness, to obtain their friendship and favor; but they having no acquaintance with fire-arms, the Eng|lish grew by degrees less apprehensive of danger, finding by means of corslets or armour that they were not much exposed to danger from bows and arrows of so simple con|struction as those of the Indians. The quarrels which the Indians had always been engaged in amongst them|selves were a further security to the English, who on the one hand endeavoured to restrain them from an open war with one another, and on the other to keep up so much contention as to prevent a combination, and to make an appeal to the English, as umpires, necessary from time to time. The English, before their arrival, had such ideas of the Sachems, that at the first meetings respect was shewn them, in some proportion to what would have been required by the Prince of a petty state in Europe; but the base sordid minds of the best of them, and the little authority they had over their own subjects soon rendered them contemptible. At New-Plimouth, the governor in the first treaty with Massasoiet, in 1620, acquainted him that King James considered him as his good friend and ally. This was too great an honor for Massasoiet, he was con|tent to acknowledge the King to be his sovereign. The next year the governor caused the petty sachems to sign an instrument, in which they owned themselves to be subject to King James.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Sept. 13. A.D. 1621.

This return was made to the governor, with further intelligence that Philip was on the march with all his men in arms, and soon after he appeared at the mill, placing centinels round a hill near to it, but sent no mes|sage into the town.

All agreed that the governor should not condescend to go out to him. At length the Massachusets commissioners offered to go out and try to persuade him to come in. At first he was unwilling, and his counsellors declared he should not go, but finally he consented, provided his men might go

with him, they to be on one side of the meeting-house and the English on the other. Philip denied that he had any further purpose in bringing his men together and arming them, than to defend himself from any attacks which might be made by the Naraganset Indians, some of whom had been engaged in quarrels with some of his people; but upon enquiry it appeared, that he was on better terms with the Naragansets than ever before, and plentiful evidence being produced of his preparations both of ammunition and provisions, and of parties of his men being destined for the attack of Taunton, Seaconk, and other places, he was confounded and made a full con|fession. Such improvement was made of it by the com|missioners that they required of him satisfaction for past damages and security against future injuries. The first was not long insisted on, but with respect to the latter, he was prevailed on to deliver up what English arms he then had with him, being about 70 guns, and to promise to send in the remainder in a few days. A writing was also drawn up, which he consented to sign, acknowledging his past breach of faith, and promising future fidelity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Taunton, 12th April 1671.

<P>THE loss of so many guns must have been grievous to Philip at a time when he only waited a good opportunity of falling upon the English. His submitting to the
<PB N="280" REF="009705_0145_0F7A45AABAF13FA8">
acknowledgment in writing was of no consequence. The Indians, in general, will promise any thing required of them to remove an impending danger, or to procure an imme|diate benefit, and they regard such promises not a minute longer than it is for their advantage to do it. When Philip was at liberty he thought no more of his engagements, the guns were not brought in, and he himself refused to come to Plimouth, when required. Many strange Indians resorted to him. On the 23d of August Mr. Morton secretary, in the name of the court of Plimouth, wrote to the Massachusets governor, to be communicated to the council, acquainting him that they had summoned Philip to appear on the 13th of September, that if he did not do it they had determined on the 20th to send out forces to reduce him to reason, unless better reason should sea|sonably appear to them, by the Massachusets advice, to prevent it, that it was a common cause, and they should well accept of assistance, but it was plainly intimated that if aid should be refused they would engage alone. Philip happened to come to Boston, with his counsellors, the same day the letter was received, and represented his case so favorably to the governor and council, that, in their answer to Plimouth, they urged that government to refer the difference between Philip and them to commissioners from the Massachusets and Connecticut.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time there was a breach in the union between the colonies from some misunderstandings, but the next year 1672 it was healed, and some alterations made in the articles.</NOTE> Plimouth de|clined this proposal and insisted on Philip's appearance at the time proposed,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The nature of Philip's subjection to the government of Plimouth was enquired into upon this occasion by the Massachusets. They say in their letter of the 8th of September,
<Q>We do not understand how far he hath subjected himself to you, but the treatment you have given him and proceedings towards him do not render him such a subject, as that if there be not a present answering to summons there should presently be a proceeding to hostilities; and the sword once drawn and dipped in blood may make him as independent upon you as you are upon him.</Q>
Notwithstanding that in the treaties from time to time, the In|dians have acknowledged themselves subjects to the Kings of England, yet they still retained, in their idea of subjection, a degree of independency which English subjects have no pretence to. The six nations go no farther than to call the great King their father. They never call themselves subjects. When Philip was at Boston in 1671, and the letters which had been received from Plimouth were read to him, he expressed himself before the governor and council as follows,
<Q>That his predecessors had been friendly with Plimouth governors, and an engagement of that nature was made by his father and renewed by his brother, and (when he took the government) by himself, but they were only agree|ments for amity and not for subjection any further, as he appre|hends; he desired to see a copy of the engagement they speak of, and that the governor of the Massachusets would procure it for him. He knew not that they were subjects. Praying Indians were subject to Massachusets and had officers and magistrates appointed, they had no such thing with them, and therefore were not subject.</Q>
<HI>(Massachusets files.)</HI> In the several treaties between the Massachusets and the eastern Indians, from Sir William Phips's treaty in 1693 down to the last treaty of peace in 1749, the Indians have always acknowledged subjection to the crown of England; notwithstanding such agreements, they have remained as independent of the Massachusets government as they were before any treaty was made with them. When they call the King their Sovereign perhaps they have no other idea than the Six Nations have when they call him Father. It is indeed at this day of no other importance than a matter of meer specula|tion, the eastern Indians, the subjects of these treaties, if the remains of all their tribes were collected into one, not deserving the name of a nation, and in a few years more they will be extinct.</NOTE> but finally the Massachusets declaring
<PB N="281" REF="009705_0145_0F7A45AABAF13FA8">
that there did not appear sufficient grounds for commenc|ing hostilities, Plimouth consented to give Philip further time until the 26th, promised him safe conduct, and de|sired commissioners from Massachusets and Connecticut to be present and give advice. Whilst Philip was at Boston

he engaged that he would not enter into a quarrel with Plimouth until he had first addressed himself to the Massa|chusets for advice and approbation.</P>

<P><PB N="283" REF="009705_0146_0F7A45AB7663B4C0">THE English have been charged by some writers with acts of injustice to the Indians, which have provoked them and occasioned the frequent wars. There have been many instances of abuses offered to particular persons among the Indians by evil minded Englishmen, and the inhabitants of some parts of the province which have suf|fered most by Indian cruelties, may have been under too strong prejudices, and by this means offenders, when brought upon trial, may have been acquitted by too fa|vorable juries. We are too apt to consider the Indians as a race of beings by nature inferior to us, and born to servitude. Philip was a man of a high spirit, and could not bear to see the English of New-Plimouth extending their settlements over the dominions of his ancestors; and although his father had, at one time or other, conveyed to them all that they were possessed of, yet he had sense enough to distinguish a free voluntary covenant from one made under a sort of duresse, and he could never rest until he brought on the war which ended in his de|struction. The eastern wars have been caused by the attachment of those Indians to the French, who have taken all opportunities of exciting them to hostilities against the English.</P>

Indians in all parts of New-England to unite against the English. The Indians about Hadley confessed such a plot. The Naragansets had engaged to bring four thousand men. This could not be done immediately. The English were upon the watch. Some fire-arms had been taken from the Indians. To provide sufficient arms, ammunition and provisions, whilst under suspicion, was a work of time. They did not expect to be prepared be|fore the spring of 1676, but Philip precipitated his own nation and his allies into a war before they were prepared. This was evident from the distraction of the Indians in all parts of New-England, upon the first news of the distur|bance
<PB N="285" REF="009705_0147_0F7A45AC7ACC3348">
from Philip. They were amazed, not knowing which way to turn, sometimes ready to declare for the English, as they had been used to do in the former con|tests with Philip, at other times inclining to join with Philip, as first or last most of them did. The war was hurried on by a piece of revenge, which Philip caused to be taken upon John Sausaman a praying Indian. He had been bred up in the profession of the christian religion, was some time at the college, and afterwards employed as a schoolmaster at Natick, but upon some misdemeanor fled to Philip, who made him his secretary and chief counsellor and confident. After remaining some years with Philip, Mr. Eliot the Indian evangelist, who had been his spiritual father, prevailed with him to return to the christian Indians at Natick, where he manifested public repentance for his apostacy and became a preacher, and conformed more to the English manners than any other Indian. In the year 1674 Sausaman upon some occasion went to Namasket (Middleborough) where he fell into company with some of Philip's Indians, and with Philip himself. There, he discovered by several circumstances that the Indians were plotting against the English. He informed the governor what he had discovered, and told him that if he should be known to be the informer it would cost him his life. It was not long after, that Sausa|man was met by three or four Indians upon a frozen pond, they knocked him down and put him under the ice, leav|ing his gun and hat upon the ice to make the world be|lieve that he accidentally fell in and was drowned. When the body was found and taken up the wounds appeared upon his head. An Indian happened to be upon an hill at a distance, and saw the murder committed. He con|cealed it for some time, but at length discovered it. The murderers were apprehended, tried upon the Indian's tes|timony and other circumstances, convicted and executed, two of them denying the fact to the last, the third, when he came to die, confessing he was a spectator of the mur|der committed by the other two. This trial was at Pli|mouth

This action of Philip in procuring the death of Sausaman has always been pronounced to be a most heinous crime. Philip no doubt considered him as a traitor and renegade who had justly forfeited his life. The Indians left murderers, to the revenge of relations and friends, but punished traitors, by public execution.</NOTE> Philip, enraged to see the imme|diate actors brought to punishment by the English laws, and expecting that it would be his own turn next, being conscious that the murderers were employed by him, took no pains to exculpate himself, but gathered what strangers he could, and together with his own men, marched them up and down the country in arms. The English of Plimouth ordered a military watch in every town, but took no other notice of the Indians behavior, hoping, that when Philip saw no measures were used for apprehending him, the threatned storm would blow over, as it had done several times before.

Hearing that Philip was in a swamp at Po|casset, the Massachusets and Plimouth forces joined, and arrived at the swamp the 18th, which they resolutely entred. They found about one hundred wigwams empty. The enemy had deserted them and retired deeper into the swamp. The English followed, but in disorder, which was inevitable, penetrating a thick swamp. They found they were in danger one from another, every man firing at every bush he saw shake. Night coming on, it was ne|cessary to retreat. They lost fifteen men. How many

They were not pursued, being much superior in numbers. The English were not yet used to fighting. A party likewise were sent from Springfield to the relief of Brookfield. Finding it effected, they returned, meeting none of the enemy. Philip and his people continued in the swamp at Pocasset until the last of July. After several skirmishes with Captain Church and other parties, they escaped from the swamp, notwithstanding the Massachusets forces kept their guards round it, and went away to the westward, without being very closely pursued, the reason of which, Mr. Hubbard says, it is better to suspend than too critically to enquire into. The 5th of August, Philip with about forty men, besides women and children, joined the Nipmuck Indians in a swamp ten or twelve miles from Brookfield.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon Friday being the 5th of this instant (August) Philip and his

Philip was conducted to the swamp by two Indians, one of them Caleb of Tatumasket, beyond Mendon. The Indians told Philip, at his first coming, what they had done to the English at Quabaog; then he pre|sented and gave to three sagamores, viz. John alias Apequinash, Quanansit, and Mawtamps&punc; to each of them about a peck of unstrung wampom, which they accepted. Philip, as I under|stood, told Quabaog and Nipmuck Indians, that when he first came towards the Nipmuck country and left his own, he had in his company about 250 men, besides women and children, including the Squaw sachem and her company, but now they had left him, and some of them were killed, and he was reduced to 40 men, besides women and children. I heard also that Philip said, if the English had charged upon him and his people at the swamp in his own country one or two days more, they had been all taken, for their powder was almost spent; he also said, that if the English had pursued him closely, as he travelled up to them, he must needs have been taken.</Q></P>

Connecticut men joined them, the 18th, at Pettyquamscot. The evening and night were stormy and the men had no covering. At break of day, the 19th, they marched through the snow fourteen or fifteen miles, until one o'clock after|noon, when they came to the edge of the swamp where the enemy lay. They had met with an Indian who was disgusted with the rest, and offered himself as a pilot. The Indians knew of the armament coming against them, and had fortified themselves with all the art and strength they were capable of. The English fell in suddenly and unex|pectedly upon this seat of the enemy, and neither drew up in any order of battle, nor consulted where or how to assault. Some Indians appearing at the edge of the swamp, they that were in the front of the army, in the march, fired upon them. The Indians returned the fire and fled. The whole army entred the swamp, following the Indians to their fortress, which was upon a piece of upland in the midst of the swamp, pallisadoed all round, and within a hedge of near a rod thick. At one corner only, was a gap the length of one log, where the breastwork was not above four or five feet high, but they had placed a block|house over against this passage. At this passage, and no where else, the English must enter. As it pleased God to order it, they fell in upon that part of the fort where the passage was. The captains entred at the head of their companies. The two first, Johnson and Davenport, were shot dead at the entrance, as were many of their men. Four other captains, Gardner, Gallop, Siely, and Marshall, also lost their lives. Assoon as the forces were entred, they attacked the Indians in their places of shelter, who fought desperately, and beat the English out of the fort; but after two or three hours, the advantage of the English was such that they began to fire the wigwams, which were five or six hundred, and in many of them the Indian wo|men and children perished, the men which were left alive

Dec. 13th we came to Mr. Smith's, and that day took 35 prisoners. Dec. 14th our general went out with horse and foot, I with my company was left to keep garrison. I sent out 30 of my men to scout abroad, who killed two Indians and brought in 4 prisoners, one of which was beheaded. Our army came home at night, killed 7 and brought in 9 more, young and old. Dec. 15th came in John, a rogue, with pretence of peace, and was dismissed with this errand, that we might speak with Sachems. That evening, he not being gone &frac14; of an hour, his company that lay hid behind a hill killed two Salem men within a mile of our quarters, and wounded a third that he is dead. And at a house three miles off where I had 10 men, they killed 2 of them. Instantly, Capt. Mosely, myself and Capt. Gardner were sent to fetch in Major Appleton's company that kept 3 miles and an half off, and coming, they lay behind a stone wall and fired on us in sight of the garrison. We killed the Captain that killed one of the Salem men, and had his cap on. That night they burned Jerry Bull's house and killed 17. Dec. 16th came that news. Dec. 17th came news that Connecticut forces were at Petaquamscot and had killed 4 Indians and took 6 prisoners. That day, we sold Capt. Davenport 47 Indians young and old for 80 l. in money. Dec. 18th we marched to Petaquamsco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with all our forces, only a garrison left; that night was very stormy, we lay, one thousand, in the open field that long night. In the morning Dec. 19th Lord's day at 5 o'clock we marched. Between 12 and 1 we came up with the enemy and had a sore fight three hours. We lost, that are now dead, about 68, and had 150 wounded, many of which are recovered. That long snowy cold night we had about 18 miles to our quarters with about 210 dead and wounded. We left 8 dead in the fort. We had but 12 dead when we came from the swamp, besides the 8 we left. Many died by the way, and assoon as they were brought in, so that Dec. 20th, we buried in a grave 34, next day 4, next day 2, and none since here. Eight died at Rhode-Island, 1 at Petaquamscot, 2 lost in the woods and killed, Dec. 20&punc; as we heard since; some say two more died. By the best intelligence, we killed 300 fighting men, prisoners we took, say 350, and above 300 women and children. We burnt above 500 houses, left but 9, burnt all their corn, that was in baskets, great store. One signal mercy that night not to be forgotten, viz. that when we drew off, with so many dead and wounded, they did not pursue us, which the young men would have done, but the sachems would not consent; they had but 10 pounds of powder left. Our general, with about 40, lost our way, and wandered till 7 a clock in the morning, before we came to our quarters. We thought we were within 2 miles of the enemy again, but God kept us; to him be the glory. We have killed now and then 1 since, and burnt 200 wigwams more; we killed 9 last Tuesday.

<SALUTE>May it please your honor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The coming in of Connecticut force to Petaquamscot, and surprisal of 6 and slaughter of 5 on Friday night, Saturday we marched towards Petaquomscot, though in the snow, and in conjunction, about midnight or later, we advanced; Capt. Mosely in the van, after him Massachusets, and Plimouth and Connecticut in the rear; a tedious march in the snow, without intermission, brought us, about two of the clock afternoon, to the entrance of the swamp, by the help of Indian Peter, who dealt faithfully with us; our m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, with great courage, entered the swamp about 20 rods; within the cedar swamp we found some hundreds of wigwams, forted in with a breastwork and flankered, and many small block|houses up and down, round about; they entertained us with a fierce fight, and many thousand shot, for about an hour, when our men valian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly scaled the fort, beat them thence, and from the blockhouses. In which action we lost Capt. Johnson, Capt. Dan|forth, and Capt. Gardiner, and their lieutenants disabled, Capt. Marshall also slain, Capt. Seely, Capt. Mason, disabled, and many other of our officers, insomuch that, by a fresh assault and recruit of powder from their store, the Indians fell on again, recarried, and beat us out of, the fort, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the great resolution and cou|rage of the general and major, we reinforced, and very hardly entered the fort again, and fired the wigwams, with many living and dead persons in them, great piles of meal and heaps of corn, the ground not admitting burial of their store, were consumed; the number of their dead, we generally suppose the enemy lost at least two hundred men; Capt. Mosely counted in one corner of the fort 64 men, Capt. Goram reckoned 150 at least: But, O! Sir, mine heart bleeds to give your honor an account of our lost men, but especially our resolute captains, as by account inclosed, and yet not so many, but we admire there remained any to return, a captive woman, well known to Mr. Smith, informing that there were three thousand five hundred men engaging us, and about a mile distant 1000 in reserve, to whom, if God had so pleased, we had been but a morsel&punc; after so much disablement; she informeth&punc; that one of their sagamores was slain and their powder spent, causing their retreat, and that they are in a distressed condition for food and houses, that one Joshua Tift, an Englishman, is their encourager and conductor. Philip was seen by one, credibly in|forming us, under a strong guard. After our wounds dressed, we drew up for a march, not able to abide the field in the storm, and weary, about two of the clock, obtained our quarters, with our dead and wounded, only the general, ministers, and some other persons of the guard, going to head a small swamp, lost our way, and returned again to the enemy's quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, a wonder we were not a prey to them, and, after at least thirty miles marching up and down, in the morning recovered our quarters, and had it not been for the arrival of Goodale next moning, the whole camp had perished; the whole army, especially Connecticut, is much disabled and unwilling to march, with tedious storms, and no lodgings, and frozen and swollen limbs, Major Treat importu|nate to return at least to Stonington; our dead and wounded are about 200, disabled as many; the want of officers, the con|sideration whereof the general commends to your honor, forbids any action at present, and we fear whether Connecticut will comply, at last, to any action. We are endeavouring, by good keeping and billeting our men at several quarters, and, if possible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emoval of our wounded to Rhode-Island, to recover the spirit of our soldiers, and shall be diligent to find and understand the removals or other action of the enemy, if God please to give us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vantage against them.</P>

He knew the premium set upon his head, disguised and concealed himself, so that we hear but little of him until he was killed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The first account of him I have met with, is in a MS. let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of Mr. Cotton, of Plimouth, upon the return of an Indian spy, who reported that Philip was with the Hadley Indians, &amp;c. within half a day's march of Albany.</NOTE> His affairs were now at the highest flow, and those of the English never at so low an ebb. But presently after, a sudden turn came on. The beginning of April, the Connecticut men under George Denison of Stonington, with some friend Indians, killed and took prisoners forty four of the enemy, and before the end of the month, the same commander, with sixty six volunteers English, and one hundred and twelve Pequod Indians, took and slew seventy six more of the enemy, without the loss of one man in either of these exploits. Between these two successful actions, happened a very unfortunate one for the Massachusets. April 20th, news came to Boston of the loss of Capt. Wadsworth and 50 of his men, going to relieve Sudbury attacked by the enemy. In May and June, the enemy appeared in various parts of the colonies, but their vigor abated, their distresses, for want of provisions and ammunition, increased, and at the same time the Mohawks fell upon them and killed 50 of them. It was commonly said, that Philip fell upon a party of Mohawks and killed them, and reported that they were killed by the English, expecting by this means to engage that nation in the war, but one that was left for dead revived and escaped to his countrymen, and in|formed that, not the English, but Philip and his Indians had been the murderers, which brought that revenge upon the guilty, which, without this discovery, would
<PB N="306" REF="009705_0158_0F7A45E35B936320">
have been taken of those who were innocent. The beginning of July, the Connecticut forces met with a party of Indians in the Naraganset country, pursued them into a swamp, and killed and took 80 of them, without any loss, except one or two friend Indians, and in their march back 60 more of the enemy fell into their hands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brave actions of the Connecticut volunteers have not been enough applauded. Denison's name ought to be perpetuated. The Naraganset fight had enraged the Indians and made them despe|rate, and the English plantations, after that, were in greater terror than before, but this successful hunting them, and ferreting them out of their boroughs, sunk and broke their spirits, and seems to have determined the fate of English and Indians, which until then was doubtful and uncertain.</NOTE> The Massachusets and Plimouth men, in several parts of the country, were likewise very successful from time to time, killing and taking small parties of Indians scattered about the country, and no commander was more fortunate than Captain, afterwards Colonel Church, of Plimouth colony. He has published an account of his exploits. But Philip was the object. Upon his life or death war or peace depended. News was brought, that, after a year's absence, he had returned to Mount-Hope, his old quarters, and that great numbers of Indians were flocking to him, with intent to fall upon the neighbouring towns. The Massa|chusets and Plimouth, both, ordered their forces after Philip. The former returned to Boston, having missed Philip, but they killed and took 150 of the enemy, who were now so reduced that they were continually coming in and surrendering themselves upon promise of mercy. Two hundred in one week came in to Plimouth. Philip fled from one swamp to another, divers times very nar|rowly escaping, losing one chief counsellor after another; his uncle and sister, and at last his wife and son were taken prisoners. Being reduced to this miserable condition, he was killed the 12th of August, as he was flying from a party under Capt. Church, out of a swamp near Mount-Hope. One of his own men, whom he had offended, and who had deserted to the English, shot him through the
<PB N="307" REF="009705_0158_0F7A45E35B936320">
heart. Instead of his scalp, he cut off his right hand, which had a remarkable scar, well known to the English, and it produced a handsome penny, many having the cu|riosity to see it. This was a finishing stroke, the parties of Indians that remained being drove from one hole or swamp to another, so that before winter they were all killed, captivated, or forced to surrender themselves, ex|cept some few, who were supposed to have fled to the French, and others, to nations of foreign Indians. The cruelties which had been exercised upon the English were urged in excuse for the treatment which the Indians re|ceived, who were made prisoners or surrendered themselves. In all the promises of mercy, those, who had been principal actors in any murders of the English, were excepted, and none had any promise made of any thing more than their lives. A great many, therefore, of the chiefs were executed at Boston and Plimouth, and most of the rest were sold, and shipped off for slaves to Bermudas and other parts. Every person, almost, in the two colonies, had lost a relation or near friend, and the people in gene|ral were exasperated;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Increase Mather, in a letter to Mr. Cotton, 23d 5. mo. 1677, mentions an instance of rage against two prisoners of the eastern Indians, then at Marblehead, a fishing town, which goes beyond any other I have heard of.
<Q>Sabbath day was se'nnight, the women at Marblehead, as they came out of the meeting-house, fell upon two Indians that were brought in as captives, and in a tumultuous way, very barbarously murdered them. Doubt|less, if the Indians hear of it, the captives among them will be served accordingly.</Q>
The Indians had murdered some of the fishermen in the eastern harbours of the province.</NOTE> but all does not sufficiently excuse this great severity.</P>
<P>THE same time that Philip began his hostilities in Plimouth colony, the Tarenteens, or Eastern Indians, were insulting the English settled in New-Hampshire and the province of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in. They began with robbing the English, as they passed in their boats and canoes, and plun|dering their houses of liquors, ammunition, and such move|ables as they could easily carry off. In September (1675)
<PB N="308" REF="009705_0159_0F7A45E3E1B83F78">
they came to the house of one Wakely, an old man, in Casco bay, and murdered him, his wife, and four children and grand-children, and carried four more of his grand-children away captives. They then fell upon Saco, and killed thirteen men, and burned the houses, killed six men and a woman at Black-point (Scarborough) and burned 20 houses. They next fell upon Kittery, and killed two men. Mr. Plaisted, lieutenant of the town, with 20 English, went out to bury the dead, and was set upon by the Indians. He fought bravely, with seven of his men (the rest flying) until he and his son, and one more, were killed. The other four escaped to the garrison. They then came to|wards Piscataqua, making spoil upon the inhabitants on the branches of that river, viz. at Oyster-river, Salmon-falls, Dover, Exeter, &amp;c. burning their houses and barns, and a mill belonging to Mr. Hutchinson, a merchant in Boston, and killing more or less of the people in every place, to the number of about fifty, in the whole. The govern|ment's hands were full, from the attempts of Philip and his accomplices, and, during the summer, nothing more was done, than to commit the care of the eastern plantations to the chief officers of the respective regiments, to defend them against the enemy; but in the fall, forces were drawn from the other counties, in order to have marched into the eastern country, but were prevented by the severity of the weather, which sat in sooner than usual. The Indians in those parts at the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e time sued for peace, and there was a good prospect of its being settled; but the endea|vours of Major Waldron to effect it were next year frus|trated. However, during the winter, and the next spring, and the greatest part of the summer, those plantations were at rest.</P>
<P>THE accounts which were transmitted to England of the distresses of the colony, during the war, although they might excite compassion in the breasts of some, yet they were improved, by others, to render the colony more ob|noxious.

But when I have said this (as the best proof of it) I must chide you and that whole people of New-England, that (as if you were independent of our master's crown, needed not his protection, or had deserved ill of him, as some have not been wanting to suggest and urge testimony thereof) from the first hour of God's stretching out his hand against you to this time (though we have successive and frequent tidings (like Job's mes|sengers) of the great devasta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions and spoils that are made by fire and sword upon those plantations, which God hath so signally blessed and made to flourish till now) you have not yet (as cer|tainly became you) made your addresses to the King's Majesty, or some of his ministers, for his perusal, that he might be authenti|cally informed both of your enemies and your condition, by what means you are brought low, and what are the most proper and hopeful remedies for your recovery.</P>
<P>I can write but by guess, yet it is not altogether groundlessly reported, that the French do underhand assist and supply your enemies, that you are divided among yourselves, that you have not used ordinary providence, that you are too tenacious of what is necessary for your preservation, as if you kept your goods for your enemies, and wanted hearts to make use of them yourselves, that you are poor and yet proud. This was not the spirit that carried you into that wilderness and led you on there ever since, building and planting for yourselves and God. But these cala|mities may come upon you to bring you to your first post, and to do your first works, tho' I would not willingly judge you therein.</P>
<P>It may not be fit for me to advise you what to do, till better informed&punc; but I know his Majesty hath a tender and compassionate heart for all his subjects that are industrious and orderly, and hath power sufficient, as well as will, to help his colonies in distress, as others have experienced, and you may, in good time. He knows how to deal with the French, either by the interposition of their own King, or by authorizing and assisting you to right yourselves against them. He can send ships or men to help you, or furnish you with ammunition, as the case requires, or by a general col|lection open the bowels and purses of his people here towards you, where there are many that mourn for your distress, and will not only be intercessors to the throne of grace, but to God's vice|gerent also, for your relief, if you are not wanting to yourselves and failing in that dutiful application which subjects ought to make to their sovereigns in such cases.</P>
<P>If these hints may work any thoughts of heart in you that may produce speedy and effectual councils for your re-establish|ment, I shall rejoice that I have been your remembrancer, and shall promote, in the best manner I can, your requests to that end, being to you, and the good people of that colony, an affectionate friend and hearty well-wisher,</P>

An application to England, for men, was unnecessary, and I meet with no papers which in|timate that there was any thought of it in any persons in the colony. Fighting made soldiers. Assoon as the in|habitants had a little experience of the Indian way of fighting, they became a match for them. An addition to their numbers they did not want. Be that as it may, this is certain, that as the colony was at first settled, so it was now preserved from ruin without any charge to the mo|ther country. Nay, as far as I can judge from the mate|rials I have, the collections made in the colony, after the fire of London, for the relief of the sufferers there, and, upon other occasions, for the relief of divers of the plan|tations, with other public donations, from the first settle|ment until the charter was vacated, will not fall much, if any thing, short of the whole sum that was bestowed upon the colony, from abroad, during that time.</P>

Soon after their arrival in England, a hearing was had before the Lords of the committee of the council, upon the principal points of their agency, the claims of Gorges and Mason, in both which they were unsuccessful. The province of Main was confirmed to Gorges and his heirs, both as to soil and government. To put an end to all future disputes, as well as to gratify many of the inha|bitants of that province, John Usher was employed by the Massachusets to purchase the right and interest of Gorges's heirs, which he did for twelve hundred pounds sterling, and assigned it over to the governor and company. This, instead of conciliating matters, gave fur|ther offence to the crown.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The colony supposed they acquired, by the purchase, a right to the jurisdiction&punc; and considered themselves, in their corporate capacity, Lords proprietors of the province of Main, as Lord Baltimore and the Penns do of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It was made a question by some, whether the right of juris|diction, in the heirs of Gorges, was such an interest as could legally be sold or devised. Since the incorporation, by the new charter, it is of no great consequence which way it be determined.</NOTE> With respect to Mason's claim, it was determined, that the Massachusets had a right to three miles north of Merrimack river, to follow the course of the river, so far as it extended, and that the expressions in the charter do not war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rant the over-reach|ing those bounds by imaginary lines or bounds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Massachusets thought themselves aggrieved by the determi|nation of his late Majesty in council, settling the boundary less favorably for them than they ever expected. The river Merri|mack, which runs upon a western course as far as Dunstable, afterwards turns to the northward. It is not certain, that at the time of the grant to the Massachusets colony, in 1628, this alter|ation of the course was known to the grantors, or to any Euro|pean. It is certain, that a few years after our ancestors came over, evidence was taken and preserved, that this river retained the same name among the natives from the mouth to the crotch, and there seemed to be no intention in 1677, that Massachusets line should cross the river. However, it was thought an equita|ble construction of the Province charter, in 1738, that so far as the river kept a western course, and no farther, the province line should run the same course, keeping the distance of three miles north of the river, but after that to run due west. There was, bes des, a mistake made to the prejudice of the province; for, instead of running as far as the river kept a western course (the real intention of the royal determination) it stops several miles short, at Patucket, where the river inclines to the south. Whereas if the line had been continued to the bend, and then crossed the river, or if the due west line had begun a few miles short of Patucket, in either case, several miles in breadth, the whole length of the line, would have belonged to the Massachusets, which now falls to New-Hampshire. This, my Lord Wilming|ton&punc; who was then president of the council, assured me in the year 1741, proceeded from a misapprehension of the course of the river. He did not conceive that at Patucket the river inclined to the southward, or that any loss was occasioned to the Massa|chusets. The New-Hampshire agent was better able to manage the controversy than the agents for the Massachusets.</NOTE></P>

<P>IN all this confusion of grants, or copies of grants, the greatest stress is laid upon that of November 7th, 1629. It is a strange thing, that the council of Plimouth, unless all those grants, prior to the Massachusets grant, had been either deemed imperfect and invalid from the beginning, or else resigned and thrown up, should grant the same lands to the Massachusets, Mason and Gorges both being members, and the most active members of the council. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is not easy to account for a grant of all the lands be|tween Merrimack and Piscataqua to Mason in 1629, when three miles between those two rivers had been granted the year before to the Massachusets. The grants which were made, or pretended to be made, in 1635, were the efforts of a number of the members of the council, to secure some part of the dying interest to themselves and posterity, in which they all failed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>An action was brought in Feb. 1682, at Portsmouth, against one Wadley of Exeter, in which this grant of 1635 was principally relied on, and Mr. Chamberlayne, secretary of the province, and one Mr. Reynes made oath, that they had compared the copy with the original, which did not appear to have been either signed, sealed, or witnessed. The lands in question had been many years occupied, and the plaintiff failed in his suit. It was observed, on the trial, that the council of Plimouth was to consist of forty persons, who had power of granting lands in New-England, provided it was done by the major part of them, or the major part of a lawful assembly of the said council, and under their common seal. Nothing of this appeared. The original grant could not be found in 1691, when Allen entered a caveat against the Massachusets charter. He pretended it was in New-England.</P>

<P>BESIDES this controversy about bounds, the agents had other complaints to answer. Randolph, who, the people of New-England said,
<Q>went up and down seeking to de|vour them,</Q>
returned to England, and represented the colony as refusing any obedience to the acts for regulating the trade of the plantations.
A ship, belonging to Mr. Usher, put the owner ashore at some English port, and went over to Holland. Mr. Stoughton writes (1st Dec. 1677)
<Q>Randolph upon this news was full of business, being employed, as he said, by my Lord treasurer, to make enquiry about it, in order to further proceedings, but now we have intelligence as if that vessel were again put into Plimouth, and had not been in Holland.

we find it most certain, that without a fair compliance in that matter, there can be nothing expected but a total breach, and all the storms of displeasure that may be.</Q></P>
<P>THE Quakers also renewed their complaints against the colony. In the distress of the colony by the Indian war, among other sins, which were the cause of it, the toleration shewn to quakers was thought to be one; the court therefore made a law
<Q>That every person found at a quaker's meeting should be apprehended, ex officio, by the constable, and, by warrant from a magistrate or commissioner, shall be committed to the house of cor|rection, and there have the discipline of the house ap|plied to them, and be kept to work, with bread and water, for three days, and then released, or else shall pay five pounds in money, as a fine to the country, for such offence, and all constables neglecting their duty, in not faithfully executing this order, shall incur the penalty of five pounds, upon conviction, one third whereof to the informer.</Q>
I know of nothing which can be urged, in any wise tending to excuse the severity of this law, unless it be human infirmity, and the many instances in history of persons of every religion being fully persuaded that the indulgence of any other was a toleration of im|piety, and brought down the judgments of heaven, and therefore justified persecution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the same time that this punishment was provided for quakers, other provoking evils were enumerated, in the order following, viz.</P>

<P N="2">2. Pride, in men's wearing long hair like womens hair, others wearing borders of hair, and cutting curling and immodest lay|ing out their hair, principally in the younger sort.

<P N="6">6. Profane cursing and swearing. If any person heard another curse or swear, and did not inform, he was made liable to the same penalty with the profane person.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tipling houses. Inspectors to be appointed, and if they did not do their duty, they were to incur the pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lty of the law against tipling houses.</P>

<P N="10">10. Oppression in shopkeepers and merchants, by taking too much for their goods, and in mechanicks, who required too much for their labour.

<P>For most of these offences I have not seen any instances of prosecu|tion. Excessive penalties, or penalties not adapted to the nature of the offence, prevent prosecutions.

one great article of charge against it. I am glad I have this instance of Ireland, and that so sensible a gentleman as Mr. Molineux, the friend of Mr. Locke, engaged in the cause; for it may serve as some excuse for our ancestors, that they were not alone in their mistaken apprehensions of the nature of their subjection. No prejudice can be caused, by this mistake, against their posterity. They have indeed as high notions of English liberties as their ancestors had, and, as a British colony, they humbly hope for all that tenderness and indulgence from a British par|liament which the Roman Senate, while Rome remained free, shewed to Roman colonies, but they are sensible that they are colonists, and therefore subject to the controul of the parent state.</P>
<P>MR. Leveret continued governor, by annual election, from his being first chosen in 1673, until his death, March 16th 1678. The weighty affairs of the war, and the agency, during his administration, conducted with pru|dence and steadiness, caused him to be greatly respected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He died of the stone. His only son maintained but an indifferent character. His grandson, John Leveret, after sustaining, in the civil order, several honorable posts, speaker of the assembly, justice of the superior court, member of the council, one of the three commissioners with power of controlling the army sent against Port-Royal, was, in 1707, chosen president of Harvard college, in which post he continued until his death, having the character of a gentleman and scholar, and also of a man of virtue and religion.</NOTE> He was succeeded by Simon Bradstreet (May 1679) who was one of the first assistants, and had continued to be annually chosen an assistant fifty years together, being about seventy six years of age when he first entered upon the office of governor. A few months before, upon the death of Mr. Symonds, Mr. Bradstreet succeeded him as deputy governor. Upon Mr. Bradstreet's being chosen governor, Thomas Danforth came into the deputy gover|nor's place, and they were continued in their respective places, from year to year, until the dissolution of the government.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="009705_0167_0F7A45EA82EECB20">WHILST the agents were in England, days of fasting and prayer, some by the court, some by the whole people, were repeatedly appointed by authority, to implore the divine blessing upon their endeavours for obtaining favor with the King, and the continuance of charter privileges, and November 21st 1678 was observed as a fast by all the churches in the three colonies. A council or synod of the churches in the colony of Massachusets being con|vened by order of court in May 1679, these two questions were referred for their consideration and answer.</P>
<P>QUEST. 1st. What are the reasons that have provoked the Lord to bring his judgments upon New-England?</P>
<P>QUEST. 2d. What is to be done that so those evils may be removed?</P>
<P>I do not censure the authority of the colony for their great anxiety on this occasion, or for using every proper measure to obtain the smiles of heaven, as well as the favor of their earthly sovereign, and only remark, that we have no evidence of any extraordinary degeneracy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Neale says
<Q>the people began to grow intolerably licentious in their morals, that devout people observed the judgments of God seemed to follow them, blasting epidemical diseases, un|common losses by sea, &amp;c.</Q>
The small-pox, which is always travelling about the world, then prevailed. There had been wars with French and Dutch, and captures by the enemy might well have been expected.</NOTE> At this time Great-Britain, Scotland especially, was suffering under a prince inimical to civil and religious liberty, New-England therefore, without a miraculous interposi|tion, must have expected to share the same judgments, and perhaps had not greater reason to make the two in|quiries than either of the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE complaint of Gorges and Mason, and the uncer|tainty of the event, restrained the general court from any attempt to hold possession of the country eastward of Main. Upon the exchange of Surinam for New-York, that country, and the islands and countries contained in the former grant to the Duke of York, were granted anew, and Major Andros, governor under the Duke, erected
<PB N="325" REF="009705_0167_0F7A45EA82EECB20">
a fort, and established a custom-house at Pemaquid, part of the territory between Kenebeck and St. Croix. Whilst the Dutch were in possession of New-York, this territory had been neglected, and the inhabitants being without any powers of government, the Massachusets (in 1672) had sent their commissioners, who appointed and held courts, and established civil and military officers from Pemaquid to Georges, the sea-coast being well inhabited, and the fishery in a flourishing state, but upon the Duke's taking possession, by his governor, they laid aside their pretences to jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THE agents were detained in England until the fall of 1679. They thought themselves not at liberty to return without the King's express leave. The po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ish plot prevented an attention to plantation affairs, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thought too great a hardship to detain them any longer. Upon their repeated application they were dismissed, and arrived at Boston, December 23d. They had obtained nothing but time, a further opportunity for the colony to comply with the requisitions made by the crown. Assurances seem to have been given by the agents that other persons should be sent over to supply their places, and although, upon their return, no mark of disapprobation of their conduct was shewn by the general court, but a vote passed thanking them for their pains, yet many were dissatisfied, especially with Mr. Stoughton, who they thought to have been too compliant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Stoughton, perhaps, ever had the interest of his country at heart, but in the pursuit of it, governed himself by the rules which Cicero, in one of his epistles, prescribes for a wise magi|strate.

<P N="2"><PB N="326" REF="009705_0168_0F7A45EB42A29F20">2. THAT freedom and liberty of conscience be given to such persons as desire to serve God in the way of the church of England, so as not to be thereby made ob|noxious, or discountenanced from their sharing in the go|vernment, much less that they, or any other his Majesty's subjects (not being papists) who do not agree in the con|gregational way, be by law subjected to fines or for|feitures, or other incapacities.</P>

At first, as has been observed, it was done to leave room for persons of quality expected from England. Those expectations had long ceased. In a popular government, and where the magistrates were annually chosen, increasing the number would give a better chance to aspiring men. On the other hand, the greater the number of assistants the less the weight of the house of deputies, the election of all officers depending upon the major vote of the whole court. This last reason might cause the deputies to refuse their consent to an increase.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. THAT all persons coming to any privilege, trust or office, take the oath of allegiance.</P>

<P N="8">8. WHILE Mr. Gorges's complaint was before the council, the agents, without his Majesty's permission, who was some time in treaty for the same, bought Mr. Gorges's interest in the province of Main, for 1200 l. His Majesty had heard of some effects, of a severe hand upon his sub|jects there, and therefore required an assignment of the said province, on repayment of the said 1200 l.</P>

Mason, the government whereof remained vested in his Majesty, designing to settle the same to the satisfaction of his subjects there, the Massachusets recall all com|missions granted by them for governing there.</P>

The reasons assigned were, the danger of the seas (Connecticut agent having been taken by the Alge|rines) and the heavy debt of the colony,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caused by the late war.</NOTE> which made it almost incapable of the expence.</P>
<P>AS to the second and third, they had no laws to restrain the inhabitants from chusing church of England men into the magistracy, or other office, that law, confining the privi|lege to church members, being long since repealed, and all protestants of 10<HI>s.</HI> rateable estate were capable of being made freemen.</P>

<P>THEY justified their purchase of the province of Main, at the desire of the inhabitants, and in favor to them; and denied their having ever used any acts of severity, and were silent as to the re-conveying it.</P>
<P>THE 9th and last they had complied with, as we have just mentioned.</P>

<P><PB N="329" REF="009705_0169_0F7A45EBFA9D0528">THE province of Main continued to be protected by the Massachusets. After the purchase from Gorges the major part of the court were of opinion that it should be sold again to the highest bidder towards reimbursing the expence of defending it, which they computed at eight thousand pounds, and a committee was appointed for this purpose, but this vote was reconsidered. However there was a necessity of a different administration from what there had been formerly. Whilst the province was sup|posed to be included in the bounds of the Massachusets charter, the towns were represented in the general court, and it was to all intents and purposes considered as a county, but the determination of 1667 had confined the Massa|chusets to three miles north or north east of Merrimack river. The colony must consider it self therefore in the place of Gorges invested with the powers granted to him by charter or patent. Accordingly, they appointed their deputy governor Thomas Danforth, president of the pro|vince of Main, to govern under the Massachusets, the lords proprietaries, and to be accountable to them, and thither he repaired towards the end of 1679 together with Mr. Nowell, &amp;c. and there appointed officers, held courts, and made provision for administring government in the form prescribed by the patent to Sir Ferdinando Gorges.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The people of the province of Main were well contented, whilst they enjoyed the privileges of the Massachusets colony. To become a province of that colony was disagreeable, and they never cordially submitted. Although the Massachusets accounted themselves a free state, yet this was no security to the others that they should be less arbitrarily governed than when a single person was the proprietor. <Q>In August 1680, the deputy go|vernor, Mr. Saltonstall, Nowell, &amp;c. sailed from Boston with 60 soldiers, in a ship and sloop, to still the people at Casco-bay, and prevent governor Andros's usurpation.</Q></P>

but no notice being taken of his application he set up an advertisement in the town house to acquaint all persons concerned that an office was erected, &amp;c. This, he said, was taken down by the marshal by order of the general court or some of the members, he therefore in a letter to the governor demands the final resolution of the court, whether they will admit the said patent to be in force or not, that he might know how to govern himself. There is no record of any resolution of the court herein. During these distresses of the colony there were two parties sub|sisting in the government, both of them agreed in the importance of the charter privileges, but differing in opi|nion upon the extent of them, and upon the proper mea|sures to preserve them. The governor, Mr. Bradstreet, was at the head of the moderate party. Randolph in all his letters takes notice of it. The governor's son in a letter from New-London, April 1681, writes
<Q>As to what you say about the change some people expect this election, so far as it concerns yourself it may be an advantage. Better the ruin, if it must be so, under other hands than yours. Time will make it appear who have been the faithful and wise conservators of New-England's liberties, and that the adored saviours of our interests, many of them, have consulted very ill the interest espoused by them.</Q>
Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Dudley, and William Brown of Salem, these fell in with the governor. The deputy go|vernor, Mr. Danforth, was at the head of the other party, the principal members of the court with him were Major Gookins of Cambridge, Peter Tilton of Hadley, Elisha Cooke and Elisha Hutchinson of Boston. This party op|posed the sending over agents, the submitting to acts of trade, &amp;c. and were for adhering to their charter accord|ing to their construction of it, and leaving the event. Gookins, being aged, desired a paper he drew up as his dying testimony might be lodged with the court, contain|ing the reasons of his opinion. He was a very zealous but an upright man and acted from principle. He seems to have been the only magistrate who a few years before
<PB N="332" REF="009705_0171_0F7A45EE606C1C20">
opposed the people in their rage against the Indians, friends and enemies without distinction, and exposed himself to the reproaches of his brethren in the magistracy upon the bench, as well as to hootings and offensive language from the populace as he passed the streets. Tilton was one of the most rigid, and was concerned in a paper, published about that time, representing the great apostacy both of magis|trates and ministers.</P>

Mr. Richard Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tonstall, son of Sir Richard, returned this year after many years absence, and was again chosen first assistant, and so the two succeeding years.

<Q>The court is altered as well as other places, Mr. H&mdash;n was to wait on master and all looked very smooth.

He kissed hands, and that night a new commission was granted to a young person under 30 years of age, who they say must go before all the grave judges. His virtues may be wrote in a little room but not his vices. A few days after the arch|bishop was sent to tell him how well he was esteemed, but he growing into years might like his ease. If he would be Lord or Earl, he should be either, or have any pension. To the first he answered, that he would die a country gentleman of an ancient family, as his was, and honor enough for him. For the second, he said, he should not take the King's money, and the King's servants want bread, he always spake against giving pensions to others, and at such a time as this it was a great oppression. While he had a roll and can of beer he would not take the King's money. It is wondred at by many, considering how useful he was in the year 88 and following&mdash;but enough of this.</Q></P>
<P>I hope the friendship shewn by the family of Hamden to New-England will excuse my inserting this anecdote, altho' it has no relation to the affairs of the colony.</P></NOTE> a letter had been received under the King's sign manual, charging the colony with neglecting to send over other agents in the room of those who had obtained leave to return, and requiring that they be sent in three months after the receipt of the letter, and that they come prepared to answer the claim which Mason had made to the lands between Naumkeag and Merrimack. Immediately upon
<PB N="333" REF="009705_0171_0F7A45EE606C1C20">
the receipt of this letter, the court chose two agents, Mr. Stoughton and Mr. Nowell, and instructions were drawn up, but both of them peremptorily refused to engage in the affair; Mr. Stoughton, notwithstanding the exceptions some had taken to his former conduct, being strongly urged to it. As for Mason's claim, it was looked upon as ground|less and extravagant, and the court gave themselves but little concern about it further than to observe, that if he had any pretence to the lands, his title would be fairly tried upon the spot, where by law and according to the opinion of the attorney and sollicitor general in 1677, it ought to be tried. After this, Randolph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In April 1681, Randolph set up a protest on the exchange in Boston, against the acts of the court.</NOTE> brought to Boston the King's letter of October the 21st 1681,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>As for the large and particular account you are pleased to give me of the concerns of the country in general, your's was sent hither to me to my house here, by Mr. Randolph, where I have been for some weeks, and do intend to stay some weeks longer, so that I doubt Mr. Randolph, by whom I send this, will be gone e'er I come to London, but, when I shall be there, I shall endea|vour to inform myself, the best I can, how matters do stand as to your colony, and shall do them the best service and friendly offices I can, and it will be very well and adviseable, that, upon Mr. Randolph's arrival, matters relating to trade be so settled, as that there be no further just complaints upon that account.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>Sir George Downing's letter to Governor Bradstreet, East-Hadley, Sept.</HI> 28. 1681.</BIBL></NOTE> complaining
<Q>that the collector had not been able to exe|cute his office to any effect, that attachments had been brought against him and his officers for doing their duty, that he had been obliged to deposit money before he could bring an action against offenders, that
<PB N="334" REF="009705_0172_0F7A45EF01026C40">
appeals, in matters relating to the revenue, had been refused, and that they had seized into their hands the moiety of forfeitures belonging to his Majesty by law.</Q>
It was therefore required,
<Q>that fit persons be sent over, without delay, to answer these complaints, with powers to submit to such regulations of government as his Majesty should think fit, that restitution be made of all monies levied from the officers, that they be encouraged in put|ting the acts of trade in execution, without charge, as in England, that an account be given of forfeitures received, and that appeals be allowed.</Q>
The court denied the charge, and said in their answer,
<Q>that Mr. Randolph was acknowledged collector, and his commission enrolled, that no suits had been countenanced against any officers, except where the subject had been unjustly vexed, that they knew of no forfeitures, except a fine upon a master of a ship for abusing the go|vernment, that they would encourage his officers, and re|quire no deposit for the future; but as to admitting appeals, they hoped it would be further considered.</Q>
However, the sending over agents could be no longer delayed. At a court called in Feb. 1681, when his Majesty's letter by Mr. Randolph was read, they determined to come to the choice of agents. Mr. Stoughton and Mr. Dudley were chosen, the court being much divided. Mr. Stoughton again utterly refused, and Mr. Richards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Richards was a wealthy merchant, of a fair character, and one of the assistant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> was chosen in his stead. The design of taking away the charter became every day more and more evident. Agents impowered to submit to regulations of government, were, in other words, agents impowered to surrender their charter. However, the general court would have been glad to put a more favorable construction upon it, it being inconsistent with his Majesty's repeated declarations, and therefore they directed their agents not to do, or consen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to any thing that should violate or infringe the liberties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd privileges granted by charter, or the government established thereby.

The other points of exception were answered as before mentioned. The agents sailed May 31st. A public fast was appointed to be observed June 22d, through the colony, to pray for the preservation of their charter and success to the agency. Randolph was in England not long after them, ready to disclose every thing the agents desired to conceal. The governor had desired him to do nothing to the prejudice of the colony. He promised, in his answer, that if they would make a full sub|mission to his Majesty, he would endeavour to procure his Majesty's royal pardon, and the continuance of their pri|vileges, so far as that they should have liberty of conscience and the free exercise of their religion, and that no money should be raised without the consent of the people; for other matters their agents were most proper to sollicit.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Feb. 1681, Randolph exhibited to the Lords of the council articles of high misdemeanor against a faction of the general court sitting in Boston, viz.

They had not then been heard before the council, but soon after, upon presenting the court's address, they were commanded to shew their pow|ers and all their instructions, not publicly, but to Sir Lionel Jenkins, secretary of state, and it appearing, upon perusal, that they did not contain such powers as had been

<Q>Our last packet from England brings us news of two very loyal addresses to his Majesty, one from New-Plimouth and the other from Connecticut, which were both very graciously received, by which I suspect you, of the Massachusets, are more whiggish, and your neighbours more toryish, to express it in the language of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite in use.</Q></NOTE> the execution was only respited a few months.</P>
<P>WE have taken no notice of the affairs of New-Pli|mouth since the year 1676. Having conquered Philip's country of Mount-Hope, now Bristol, it was confirmed to that colony by King Charles. The Massachusets had applied for it. Mr. Winslow, the governor of Plimouth, died in 1680, Dec. 18th, and was succeeded by Thomas Hinkley, who continued until that colony was included in the same commission with the Massachusets, &amp;c. It was agreed, that the grand council of Plimouth could confer no powers of government. They had nothing therefore to support them at New-Plimouth, but the King's approbation, from time to time, of their proceedings. It might then well be expected that they should act with great caution, to avoid giving offence. They had been amused, from year to year, with assurances that the King would grant them a charter. Such an one as Connecticut had received they prayed for. The name of the Massachusets was odious. The governor kept upon good terms with Randolph, who engaged to do every thing in his power to obtain the

It is not probable any thing will be determined, in that behalf, until his Majesty do see an issue of proceedings in relation to the Massachusets co|lony, and that, upon regulating their charter, that colony be brought under such an actual dependance upon the crown as becomes his Majesty's subjects. From hence it will be, that your patent will receive it's model; and although you may be assured of all you desire, yet it will be expected that, in acknowledgment of so great favors, such provisions may be inserted as are necessary for the maintenance of his Majesty's authority.</Q>
After this, they could have no great reason to hope for success. However, they continued&punc; their pursuit, and in Nov. 1683, they forwarded another address, wherein they congratu|lated his Majesty upon his deliverance, in answer to their prayers they hoped, from the late horrid conspiracy, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This must be the protestant plot.</NOTE> and they had appointed the 15th instant for a day of solemn thanksgiving, for the salvation of his Majesty's royal person from that and other hellish conspiracies. They go on to pray his Majesty's favor, in granting them a charter, having sent over a true copy of their patent from the council of Plimouth. Randolph writes to the governor of Plimouth, the 4th of March following, that he had pre|sented the address, with the necessary amendments, to his Majesty in council, that it would be printed, was graciously received, and that they would find the benefit of it, in dispatch, and settlement of their colony.

An address was sent to the King, upon his accession, taking notice of the assurances they had re|ceived from his royal brother, and praying that his Majesty would fulfil them. This was the last effort.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>King Charles's grant, under his sign manual, of Philip's country, is in these words,

The prisoners, by his means, were treated with more humanity and courtesy than had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> known, and he sent one or two of them to Piscataqua, in order to ransom their friends; but the goods sent for their ransom were seized by other Indians. Mugg himself came to Piscataqua, and afterwards to Boston, where, in behalf of Madockawando and Cheberrina, sachems of Penobscot, he entered into treaty with the governor and council, Nov. 13th 1676. This was the first treaty with any of the Tarrateens, or eastern Indians.
<Q>They promised to cease all acts of hostility, to return the captives, to do their utmost to repair the damage sustained by the English, to buy no powder or ammunition of any other than per|sons deputed by the governor, provided they could have a supply in that way, and to account all other eastern Indians in the number of their enemies, who did not assent to the same covenant and agreement.</Q>
No mention is made of any subjection to the government of the colony, or to the King of England, but they are considered as a free inde|pendent people. The treaty is at large in Mr. Hubbard's history of the war. The Indians continued, notwithstand|ing, to do mischief on the eastern frontier in 1677, when Major Andros, by virtue of his commission from the Duke of York, having placed forces at Pemaquid, the Indians made overtures of peace and friendship, and, as a proof of their sincerity, brought in 15 English captives, and they continued for some time quiet. An attack was made upon

<P>MR.

At my first arrival, I met with outward expressions of joy and satisfaction, and many seemed well pleased at the change, having been struck with a panick fear, upon the apprehensions of Col. Kirk's coming hither to be their governor; but finding a commission directed to a gen|tleman amongst themselves, the then governor and company, growing hardy, began, by their ministers, to tempt Mr. Dudley not to accept of his Majesty's commission to be president, hoping thereby to continue the government amongst themselves, but that failing them, they adjourned the meeting of their general assem|bly to the 2d of October next, and broke up with hopes, that, either by some unhappy accidents in the affairs of state at home, or some dissention, raised by their artifices among the members in this new government, they might prevail so far as to dissolve this constitution, and reassume the government, which to accom|plish, they are very sollicitous.&mdash;Of a president and 18 members of the council, there is only myself, since Mr. Mason's departure for England, that is of the church of England. It was never intended that the charge should be supported by myself and some few others of our communion.

Thus much relating to the affairs of our church. That of our state little differs.

<P>Mr. Dudley's commission made him president of the council for Massachusets-Bay, New-Hampshire and Main, and the Naraganset country, or King's province, William Stoughton was named de|puty president, Simon Bradstreet, Robert Mason, John Fitz Win|throp, John Pynchon, Peter Bulkley, Edward Randolph, Wait Winthrop, Richard Wharton, John Usher, Nathanael Saltonstall, Bartholomew Gidney, Jonathan Tyng, Dudley Bradstreet, John Hinks and Edward Tyng, were named of the council, not by separate warrants or by mandamus, but all in one commission.</P>
<P>Besides the president, Stoughton, Bulkley, Pynchon, Gidney and Tyng had been of the assistants before. N. Saltonstall, who was also in the commission, appeared once to excuse himself, having a few days before taken the oath of assistant. The governor, Mr. Bradstreet, was also named, and the president, with the council, waited upon him at his house, the 14th of May, imme|diately upon opening the commission, but he made several excuses and did not accept. His son, Dudley Bradstreet, also refused.</P></NOTE> The house of deputies, indeed, was entirely laid aside, but the people, the time being short, felt little or no effect from the change.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="009705_0180_0F7A45F6822D4810">MR. Dudley, having made Randolph trumpeter of his attachment to the prerogative and answered his ends, soon after grew cool towards him. Randolph in return vilified Dudley, in a great number of letters he wrote to London about a month after his arrival, which letters, or the copies, are preserved.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Randolph writes to one of the nobility, by Mr. Dudley when he went to England agent for the colony,

October 27. 1686, he writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
<Q>I have taken care to inform myself how the money sent over here for evangelizing the Indians is disposed of. Here are seven persons, called commissioners, or trustees, who have the sole management of it, the chief of which are, Mr. Dudley our president, a man of a base, servile and antimonar|chial principle, Mr. Stoughton of the old leaven, Mr. Richards, a man not to be trusted in public business, Mr. Hinkley, a rigid independent, and others like to these. &amp;c.</Q></NOTE> Mr. Stoughton was Mr. Dudley's chief con|fident. He was not suspected by the body of the people of being unfriendly, or of want of strong attachment to the religious principles and to the ecclesiastical constitution of the country, and his compliance, in taking a share in the admi|nistration, was charitably supposed to be, at least in part, for the sake of keeping out oppressors and tyrants. Mr. Dud|ley professed as great an attachment to the interest of the colony as Mr. Stoughton, and was very desirous of
<PB N="352" REF="009705_0181_0F7A45F73857ACF0">
retaining their favor. A letter, the day he demanded the government, to Mr. Mather, then the minister of the greatest influence in the colony, is a proof of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>I rose this morning with full intention to wait on you by eight of the clock, before I had your letter to put me forward, and am sorry to find you from home. I am very sollicitous, whatsoever be the issue of the present hurry, for my dear mother at Cambridge&punc; and cannot be happy if it do not flourish. I never wanted your favour and advice so much as now, and would pray an opportunity with you this evening if possible. Sir, for the things of my soul I have these many years hung upon your lips, and ever shall, and in civil things am desirous you may know with all plainness my reasons of procedure, and that they may be satisfactory to you,</Q></P>

<SIGNED>I am, Sir your servant, J. DUDLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE> The people were not so charitable as to believe him sincere. However, there was no molestation to the churches of the colony, but they continued both worship and discipline as before. The affairs of the towns were likewise ma|naged in the same manner as formerly.</P>
<P>THEIR courts of justice were continued upon the former plan, Mr. Stoughton being at the head of them. Trials were by juries as usual. Even in the court of admiralty, the trials were by juries, but, as the jurors were returned by the marshall, very different verdicts were given from what would have been given under the former ad|ministration. The president, as ordinary, took all matters of wills and administrations into his own hand. In general, the former laws and established customs, so far as related to judicial proceedings, seem to have been their rule, although the government which framed them was dis|solved. Mr. Dudley considered himself as appointed to preserve the affairs of the colony from confusion until a governor arrived, and a rule of administration should be more fully settled. The necessity of the thing justified the former magistrates in continuing, so long as they did, to exercise authority, although the judgment against the charter had been declared in form; otherwise, under the
<PB N="353" REF="009705_0181_0F7A45F73857ACF0">
same administration in England, which had caused their charter to be vacated, they would undoubtedly have been called to answer. But their authority was weak. Mr. Dudley writes to his friend Randolph, Sept. 1685,
<Q>I suppose it cannot be thought expedient or safe to let the government here be at such strange uncertainties, as it must needs be, until his Majesty's pleasure be known.</Q></P>
<P>CONNECTICUT, Plimouth and Rhode Island continued their former administration. Mr. Dudley had some dis|pute with Plimouth governor concerning the admiralty jurisdiction, which he claimed as vice-admiral of New-England, but it remained undetermined.</P>
<P>DECEMBER 19. 1686, Sir Edmund Andros arrived at Nantasket, in the Kingfisher, a 50 gun ship, with com|missions from King James for the government of New-England. He was less dreaded than Kirk, but he was known to be of an arbitrary disposition. He kept a correspondence with the colony, whilst he was governor of New-York. His letters, then, discovered much of the dictator. The depressed state of the colony prevented a proper return. He landed at Boston the 20th, and his commission was published the same day.</P>
<P>THE beginning of his administration gave great en|couragement. He made high professions of regard to the public good and the welfare of the people both of merchants and planters, directed the judges to administer justice according to the custom of the place, ordered the former established rules to be observed as to rates and taxes, and that all the colony laws not inconsistent with his commission should be in force.</P>
<P>THE major part of his council were men, who although they had been of the moderate party, yet they wished the public interest, and would have been glad to have conti|nued under the old form of government. With a good share of firmness of mind they might have been serviceable so long as they were permitted to hold their places in council. But their behavior under the old charter dis|covered they had more of the willow than of the oak in

more years than Sir Edmund and his creatures did months. It was not long before the case of some who apprehended themselves oppressed came under consideration; one of the council told them that they must not think the privileges of Englishmen would follow them to the end of the world. This gave an alarm through the government, and it was never forgotten.</P>
<P>ONE of the first acts of power, after the change of government, was the restraint of the press. Randolph was the licenser. There was not so much room to complain of this proceeding as if the press had been at liberty before. It only changed its keeper, having been long under re|straint during the former administration. A restraint up|on marriages was more grievous. None were allowed to marry except they entered into bonds with sureties to the governor, to be forfeited in case there should afterwards appear to have been any lawful impediment. Magistrates still continued to join people in matrimony. Other provision could not immediately be made. There was but one episcopal minister in the country. His name was Ratcliffe. Sir Edmund considered the congregational ministers as meer lay men. Randolph wrote to the bishop of London,
<Q>I press for able and sober ministers, and we will contribute largely to their maintenance, but one thing will mainly help, when no marriages shall hereafter be allowed lawful but such as are made by the ministers of the church of England.</Q></P>
<P>THERE had been very few instances of even occasional assemblies for religious worship according to the rites and ceremonies of the church of England for more than fifty years. When the commissioners from King Charles were at Boston in 1665 they had a chaplain with them, but there was no house for public worship. Most of the in|habitants who were upon the stage in 1686 had never seen a church of England assembly. About that time, a small number of persons formed themselves into a society which had increased, if we may give credit to Randolph,

<BIBL><HI>I. Moodey's letter to Mather,</HI> 8. <HI>Feb.</HI> 88.</BIBL></NOTE> This was enough to prevent any open discouragement even whilst the charter govern|ment continued.

The people were menaced that their meeting-houses should be taken from them, and that public worship in the congregational way should not be tolerated.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Among other complaints against Sir Edmund, this was one,
<Q>That the service of the church of England had been forced into their meeting-houses.</Q>
This was an equivocal expression. Sir Edmund had made use of a meeting house for the church service, against the wills of the proprietors, but after their service was over, and compelled no congregationalist to join with him.

The design was seen by some, but the greater part swallowed the bait. Several churches had agreed to set apart days of thanksgiving for his Majesty's gracious declaration for liberty of conscience. The governor for|bad them. The reason is not mentioned. It must be supposed to have been this, that he looked upon it to be the royal prerogative to appoint such days. He told them they should meet at their peril, and that he would send soldiers to guard their meeting-houses. Many congre|gations agreed to address the King.

<P><PB N="359" REF="009705_0184_0F7A45F978EAB978">BUT the greatest profit arose from patents for lands. The charter being vacated the people were told that their titles to their estates were of no value. The expression in vogue was that "the calf died in the cow's belly." Be|sides, the general court had not made their grants under the seal of the colony. This was represented as a notable defect which possession and improvement could not heal. However, it was made public that all who would acknow|ledge the insufficiency of their title derived from the for|mer government, by petitioning for new patents, should be quieted upon reasonable terms. The fees for the patents varied according to circumstances both of persons and estates. In the complaint to King James it is alledged that the fees of some amounted to fifty pounds. Prudence was used. Men's titles were not questioned all at once. Had this been the case, according to the computation then made, all the personal estate in the colony would not have paid the charge of the new patents. Some that had been most attached to the old administration were among the first who were threatned. I find a petition of Samuel Sewall, who had been a magistrate (afterwards chief justice) for confirmation of his title to a valuable island in Boston harbour (Hog island.) In a letter to a friend, a short time after, he laments his compliance. There are many hun|dred
<PB N="360" REF="009705_0185_0F7A45FB9ADEA598">
petitions of the same kind upon the files. Some favorites looked with an envious eye upon some of the best estates, especially where the property was in a town or company. A petition of Capt. Hutchinson and others labored, although their title was originally derived from the Indian sachems and proprietors, and the lands had been long possessed and improved. One of the best islands in New-England, in Plimouth harbour, called Clark's island, from the name of the person who first landed there, had been appropriated for the benefit of the poor of the town. This was granted to Nathaniel Clark, who had been secre|tary of that colony, and was afterwards of Sir Edmund's council and one of his greatest tools.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Awful and considerable changes have attended poor Pli|mouth since your departure from the gurnet, by reason of the motions about Clark's island.

King James assured their agent he would take as much care of New as of Old England, and no doubt he intended to bring his subjects in both under the same regulation. The charges of government, over and above the fees of the several officers, were not ex|cessive. Under the charter the salaries were below the dignity of the offices, the highest allowance to the gover|nor not exceeding one hundred pounds per annum. What salary Sir Edmund received does not appear. The second year of his administration the public charge was greatly en|creased by a war with the Indians. There was a general sub|mission to the taxes, and the assessments were proportioned upon the inhabitants of the towns by officers chosen by themselves. It is probable this was the reason of conti|nuing to the towns some of their privileges. Every town was suffered to meet once a year to chuse their officers, but all meetings at other times or for other purposes were strictly forbidden. An intire new model of government was intended, but there was not time to perfect it. There are minutes of a great number of bills passed the council and approved by the governor, but the bills themselves are lost. The old laws of the colony seem to have continued the rule for the administration of justice, except where they were superseded by any new edicts. Mr. Dudley and Mr. Stoughton were two of the judges of the superior court, and neither of them disposed to go to the extremes

<Q>This barba|rous people, the Indians, were never civilly treated by the late government, who made it their business to encroach upon their lands, and by degrees to drive them out of all.

Reprisals were made the 5th Sept. and one Henry Smith and his family taken at New Dartmouth, and the next day Edward Taylor and his family were taken from the same place, and all carried to Taconnett, up Kenebeck river, where they found nine captives taken from the lower parts of the river. The Indians killed divers

Mr. Wise, after the revolution, brought an action against Mr. Dudley, chief judge, for denying him the benefit of the habeas corpus act. Mr. Mather, one of the ministers of Boston, had been a very active person in dissuading from the surrender of the charter, and published reasons against it. Randolph frequently mentions him, in his letters, as a factious person. He behaved with so much prudence as to give no room to take hold of any part of his conduct. A forged letter was therefore forwarded, in his name, by way of Barbados, directed to a person in Amsterdam, but intercepted and shewn by Randolph to Sir Lionel Jenkins, who was reflected upon in the letter. There were many passages in favor of Ferguson, Lord Shaftsbury, Oates, &amp;c. all which must have made the writer obnoxious to the King and his ministers, and raised a prejudice against the country. Sir Lionel either suspected the forgery, or treated the thing with contempt, asking whether it was that star-gazer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mather had just before published a discourse upon comets.</NOTE> wrote it, so that Randolph missed his aim. Mr. Mather, two or three years, after being informed of the danger he had been in, exculpated himself in a letter to a friend, and charged the forgery upon Randolph or his brother. This letter coming to Randolph's knowledge, he brought an action of defamation against Mr. Mather, and laid his damage at five hundred pounds. The jury gave the defendant costs. But Randolph, I know not how, was bringing a new action for the same defamation. Mr. Mather's friends advising him of it, he kept concealed to avoid the service of the writ. About this time some of the principal men of the colony flattered themselves that they might obtain a partial relief by a representation of their grievances to the King, and Mr. Mather was thought a proper person to be their agent or messenger, and he embarked in the night and in disguise. The service of Randolph's writ would have prevented his voyage.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mather sailed in April 1688.

There were two persons in London at that time who had been assistants under the charter, Samuel Nowel and Elisha Hutchinson. They joined with Mr. Mather in a remonstrance to the King. One of the new council, Richard Wharton, sensible of the distresses of the country, concurred with the others also, as appears by his letters, but all was to no purpose.

possession.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the general exception to all titles, that they were derived from a grantor which had no title, in the case of towns there was this further, that they were not capable of taking any estate.</NOTE> Besides the real oppressions from this arbitrary administration, many groundless jealousies were raised which increased the terror of the people. Castine, it was inti|mated, was robbed with the privity of the authority, in order to incense the French and Indians.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Edmund had given orders to Pipon, commander of the fort at Pemaquid, to range the coast as far as St. Croix. This appears by a letter from Pipon to the governor, and the whole was includ|ed in Sir Edmund's commission. But Dr. Mather gives this rea|son for doing it at this time.
<Q>A parcel of French wines had been seized at the eastward, and at the instance of the French ambassador, an order had been obtained to restore them. A new line was supposed to be then made for the province to evade the order. This line took in Castine's country. He thereupon fled, and his arms and goods were brought to Pemaquid. And this brought on the war.</Q></NOTE> Upon the first insurrection of the Indians, the inhabitants began to fortify and garrison their houses. Sir Edmund ordered them to desist. An Indian who came in to Sudbury affirmed to the people there that the Indians understood from the governor that the French and Irish would take possession of Boston in the spring. A Penicook Indian affirmed that the Maquas or Mohawks had sent a messenger to inform the Penicook tribe that Sir Edmund had hired them to fight against the English. These idle stories were spread about the country. The Mohawks, it is true, made peace with the French, under the influence of Sir Edmund. The close connection between the courts of England and France at this time well accounts for it.</P>

Notwithstanding his care, many died with hardships, more, it was thought, than the whole number of Indians at that time in hostility. Not one Indian was killed. They all fled into their more remote dens, where they remained the whole winter.

Upon his arrival, he was imprisoned by justice Foxcroft and others, for bringing a traiterous and treasonable libel into the country, as the mittimus expressed it. Winslow offered two thousand pounds bail, but it could not be accepted. A proclamation was issued, charging all officers and people to be in readiness to hinder the landing of any forces which the Prince of Orange might send into those parts of the world. The old magistrates and heads of the people silently wished, and secretly prayed, for success to the glorious undertaking, and determined quietly to wait the event. The body of the people were more im|patient. The flame, which had been long smothered in their breasts, burst forth with violence, thursday the 18th of April, when the governor and such of the council as had been most active, and other obnoxious persons, about fifty in the whole, were seized and confined, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he old magistrates were reinstated. This was certainly a rash precipitate proceeding. Little or no inconvenience could arise from a few days delay. The revolution in England could not, at any time, have been effected without risque to all persons there who moved in it. Their lives depended on the success of the attempt. But the fate of New-England depended upon that of Old. If the Prince suc|ceeded, they might have assumed the government without any hazard. If he failed, had they remained quiet, they would have been in no worse state than before; but the consequence of an insurrection would have been death to the principal actors, and a still harder slavery than before to all the rest of the inhabitants.

<P><Q>THE consideration of my sending you a blank, where|in only the declaration was inclosed, seems to deserve a check, and constrains me to an apology, not having so much as liberty granted me by the messenger to write two or three lines, whereby you might have understood the present state of things, which by this time you are doubtless acquainted with; but least it should prove otherwise, I have taken the pains to give a brief account.&mdash;I knew not any thing of what was intended, until it was began, yet being at the north end of the town, where I saw boys running along the streets, with clubs in their hands, encouraging one another to fight, I began to mistrust what was intended, and, hastening towards the town-dock, I soon saw men running for their arms, but before I got to the red lion, I was told that Capt. George and the master of the frigate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rose.</NOTE> were seized and secured in Mr. Colman's house, at the north end, and when I came to the town-dock, I understood that Bulli|vant and some others of them were laid hold of, and then, immediately, the drums began to beat, and the people hastened and ran, some with and some for arms. Young Dudley <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dudley, his father, was absent, holding court in the Nara|ganset country. Some of Providence went out and seized him. He was brought to Roxbury and a guard placed round his house, to secure him, as the order expresses it, against viol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce.

The governor immediately sent Dudley on an errand, to request the four ministers, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Allen, Moodey, Willard, and Cotton Mather.</NOTE> Mr. Joyliffe <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A person who had been many years a leading man in town affairs in Boston.</NOTE> and one or two more, to come to him at the fort, pretending that, by them, he might still the people, not thinking it safe for him to go to them.
<PB N="375" REF="009705_0192_0F7A46006F8D2C08">
They returned for answer, that they did not think it safe for them to go to him. Now, by this time, all the persons whom they concluded not to be for their side, were seized and secured, except some few who had hid themselves, who afterwards were found, and dealt by as the rest. The governor, with Palmer, Randolph, Lid|get, West, and one or two more, were in the fort. All the companies were soon rallied together at the town|house, where assembled Capt. Winthrop,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were both of them of Sir Edmund's council.</NOTE> Shrimpton,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were both of them of Sir Edmund's council.</NOTE> Page,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He married president Dudley's sister.</NOTE> and many other substantial men, to consult mat|ters; in which time the old governor <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Other accounts say, that he and the old magistrates were guard|ed by the militia with great formality.</NOTE> came among them, at whose appearance there was a great shout by the sol|diers. Soon after, the jack was set up at the fort, and a pair of colours at beacon-hill, which gave notice to some thousand soldiers on Charlestown side that the con|troversy was now to be ended, and multitudes would have been there, but that there was no need. The frigate, upon the news, put out all her flags and pen|dants, and opened all her ports, and with all speed made ready for fight, under the command of the lieutenant, he swearing that he would die before she should be taken, although the captain sent to him, that if he fired one shot or did any hurt, they would kill him, whom they had seized already; but the lieutenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not regarding, kept those resolutions all that day. Now, about four of the clock in the afternoon, orders were given to go and de|mand the fort, which hour the soldiers longed for, and had it not been just at the nick, the governor and all the crew had made their escape on board the frigate, a barge being sent for them, but the soldiers, being so near, got the barge. The army divided and part came up on the back side of the fort, part went underneath the hill to the lower battery or sconce, where the red coats were, who immediately upon their approach retired up to the fort to their master, who rebuked them for not firing
<PB N="376" REF="009705_0193_0F7A4601571B4C68">
on our soldiers, and, as I am informed, beat some of them. When the soldiers came to the battery or sconce, they presently turned the great guns about and pointed them against the fort, which did much daunt those within, and the soldiers were so void of fear, that, I presume, had those within the fort been resolute to have lost their lives in fight, they might have killed an hundred of us at once, being so thick together before the mouths of the cannon of the fort, all loaden with small shot, but God prevented it. Then they demanded a surrender, which was denied, until Mr. West and another should first go to the council, and after their return we should have an answer, whether to fight or no. Upon their return, they came forth from the fort,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q><P>Mr. John Nelson, a young gentleman of Boston, at the head of the soldiers, demanded the fort the second time, and then the governor came down and surrendered himself and the fort.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Neale.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> and went dis|armed to the town-house, and from thence, some to the close goal, and the governor, under a guard, to Mr. Usher's house. The next day, they sent the two colo|nels to demand of him the surrender of the castle, which he resolved not to give, but they told him, if he would not give it presently, under his hand and seal, he would be exposed to the rage of the people, and so left him; but he sent and told them that he would, and did so, and they went down, and it was surrendered to them with cursings, and they brought the men away and made Capt. Fairweather commander in it. Now, by the time that the men came back from the castle, all the guns, both in ships and batteries, were brought to bear against the frigate, which were enough to have shattered her in pieces at once, resolving to have her. It is incident to corrupt nature to lay the blame of our evil deeds any where rather than on ourselves, so Capt. George cast all the blame now upon that devil Randolph, for had it not been for him he had never troubled this good people, earnestly solliciting that he might not be constrained to
<PB N="377" REF="009705_0193_0F7A4601571B4C68">
surrender the ship, for by so doing both himself and all his men would lose their wages, which otherwise would be recovered in England, giving leave to go on board and strike the topmasts and bring the sails on shore, and so he did. The country people came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">med into the town, in the afternoon, in such rage and heat, that it made us all tremble to think what would follow, for nothing would satisfy them, but that the governor must be bound in chains or cords, and put in a more secure place, and that they would see done before they went away; and, to satisfy them, he was guarded by them to the fort.&mdash;</Q></P>

<P><Q>About 14 days ago arrived two men of war and six merchant ships from France, which came furnished with recruits of provision, ammunition, 30 more great guns, 24 pateraroes, one mortar and 30 shells.&mdash;A little before the arrival of these ships, Madocka|wando the Penobscot sachem came here, who made and received divers compliments, presented the governor with five English captives, and received from him presents encouraging him and the rest to continue the war, but all gave but little satisfaction to the Indians, who expected greater recompence. They would often discourse their discontent to some of us who understand their language. I was in hopes to make some improvement of their discontent, by proposing the settlement of a trading house up Penobscot river at Negas. They were glad of the proposal, and it is the only means of recovering our interest with these eastern Indians. I promised to send my thoughts thereon to yourselves of which I would have you to consider, &amp;c.&mdash;Madockawando gave daily advice of all their results, he is certainly well affected towards us. Two days ago he was dispatched from hence, with orders to get together all the Indians he can, they make account of two or three hundred, they are to remain at Penobscot until the two men of war join them, who are preparing themselves as well as they can, adding to their number 200 Canadians, so that, in all, they will have above 400, who, with the Indians, are to assault Wells, Isles of Shoals and Piscataqua. The design is dangerous if you should be unprovided, I have therefore improved my ut|most endeavours to give you this intelligence. By money and a promise of good reward from yourselves, I have corrupted two Frenchmen, viz. Arnaud Du Vignon and Francis Albert to be bearers of this letter, and also to be guides to two Dutchmen and two Englishmen, who promise to be with you in 22 days. I pray that they may be contented. I have furnished them with 13 French crowns which it is just should be allowed to my wife. My charge is otherwise great here, there being so many of my poor countrymen to relieve, &amp;c. The two men of war, which come from hence, are the one a great Dutch square stern ship of about 500 tons, takes in six guns from hence, so that she will have in all 38 guns, &amp;c. the other is a French frigate of 34 guns, who is the admiral. They take at Port Royal and along the coast all the small vessels, shallops, boats, &amp;c. to land their men.

<P>The letters came to Springfield the 23d of September, and a day or two after to Boston. The French men, not long after, by some means or other were retaken and carried to Canada, where they were punished as deserters. Before their execution they confessed the whole. Mr. Nelson was carried out with them in expectation of the same fate. They were shot before his eyes. He was sent back to prison and soon after to France, but on his passage pre|vailed with a fellow passenger to convey intelligence of a second design of 12 men of war and 2000 troops which were every day from Piscataqua to Carolina. He was confined in France in a small hole for two years, without opportunity of seeing any per|son but a servant who brought his victuals to a grate. A gen|tleman, who had taken notice of the person who carried the vic|tuals from day to day, had the curiosity to enquire what prisoner was there, and to speak to him at the grate, and to ask if he could do him any service. Mr. Nelson desired no other favor than to have a letter sent to England to inform Sir Purbeck Temple of his condition, which was done, and soon after a demand was made of his release or exchange. He was then looked upon as a person of some importance. He was sent to the Bastile, and just before the peace of Ryswick was allowed to go to England, upon his pa|role and security given by a French gentleman for his return. The peace being concluded and he intending to return was forbad to do it by King William, but to prevent any trouble to his friend he went contrary to order, and surrendered himself. Being dis|charged, upon his return to England he was brought into trouble there for going back to France contrary to the King's order, but at length returned to his family after ten or eleven years absence.</P>

<P><Q>IT was an extraordinary surprize to us to hear of the confusions the inhabitants at Boston have occasioned, by taking that part of the government to themselves, and that they have seized upon the person of his excel|lency and several of the officers. We cannot imagine that any such actions can proceed from any person of quality amongst them, but rather promoted by the rabble, and that for the safety of his excellency's person those measures have been taken, but hope and doubt not, be|fore this time, the fury of those persons may be allayed, and that his excellency and the rest of the officers may
<PB N="384" REF="009705_0197_0F7A46059ADC01D0">
be restored to their former stations, or at least have liberty to come hither. For this part of the govern|ment, we find the people in general inclined to peace and quietness,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of New York, having never experienced any great degree of liberty, there would have been no grounds of fears of a revolt, if it had not been for the example of New-England. From their first subjection to England, the government had been the same, and the Dutch governors who preceded were not less absolute than the English. Upon the news from Boston, Capt. Nicholson, the lieut. governor, proposed to admit part of the trained bands to watch and ward by turns within the fort, un|der their own officers, and offered to apply the money arising from the customs to the fortifying the city and making it defen|sible against a foreign enemy. Jacob Leisler, a captain of the train'd bands, happened to have a ship just arrived with wines, the duties whereof would have amounted to one hundred pounds, which he refused to pay,
<Q>the collector being a papist, and there being no legal authority to receive it.</Q>
Soon after, he excited the people upon the east end of Long Island to march to New York, in order to take possession of the fort, to prevent its being deliver|ed up to foreigners. When they came within 12 miles of the city, being about 80 in number, they sent three of their leaders to the lieut. governor, who, having convened his council, gave them such answers as induced them and the rest of the company to return home. A rumor was soon after spread of a design to massacre the inhabitants during the public worship in the Dutch church upon a sunday. The friday before the day for the sup|posed execution, the people rose and seemingly compelled Leisler to head them. One Hall went as their leader to the fort. The guard, consisting of the train'd bands, readily admitted them. Leisler followed and took the command of the men. This was the 31st May. The same evening they sent for the keys from the lieut. governor, who was obliged to deliver them. The trained band consisting of six companies, the captain of each com|pany was to command his day according to their order. When it came to Leisler's turn, the 3d of June, he caused an alarm, and the people being all brought together, a declaration was pre|pared in writing ready to be signed,
<Q>that with their lives and fortunes they would defend the protestant religion, and keep the fort for King William and Queen Mary, until their Majesties fur|ther order.</Q>
The people then chose a committee, who assumed the name of a "committee of safety."
They appointed Leisler cap|tain of the fort. The lieut. governor withdrew. In his absence Leisler takes upon him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ministration, and after some time calls himself lieut. governor, and chuses a council. The pro|vince continued in great confusion, until the arrival of governor Slaughter with a commission from King William and Queen Mary. Leisler held the possession of the fort against the governor, longer than he could justify himself in so doing. His enemies took the advantage of it, and he was tried condemned and executed as a traitor. The party rage which was raised on this occasion, was kept up many years after in New-York and descended to the pos|terity of each side.</NOTE> and doubt not the people will remain in their duties. We do not question but you will send us a speedy answer, the matter being of so great consequence, tend|ing to the peace and quietness of us all, which if you do, we remain your friends and servants.</Q></P>

<P>THE 26th (being Sunday) a ship arrived from England with advice of the proclaiming King William and Queen Mary. This was the most joyful news ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r received in New-England. The fears of the people, of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y very bad consequences from their late actions, were now over.

<P>THE 5th of June, the representatives of the several towns, upon a new choice, assembled at Boston. The council immediately proposed to them to exhibit articles against the gentlemen seized by the people, or else to con|sent to their inlargement, upon security given, but this was not agreed to.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some days after, Sir Edmund, by letter, demanded an immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> release of himself and the other persons concerned in government, or under his charge, then in custody or under restraint.

urged to the council, to take upon them the part they ought to bear in the government, according to the charter, until orders should be received from England, and declared
<Q>they could not proceed to act in any thing of public con|cerns, until this was conceded.</Q>
An acceptance was voted, this declaration being given as the reason of the vote. By these steps the change was made from the unlimited power of Sir Edmund and four of his council, to the old government, which had continued above fifty years; but the weight and authority did not return with the form. They were scrupulous of their power themselves, and made an apology, in an address to the crown, for causing certain pirates to be executed. They found it very difficult to raise men, and continue them in service, for the defence of the province. Several contemptuous pamphlets against them were published with impunity. Thirty years before, the authors of the like would have been guilty of a capital offence. And although the first advices, received after|wards from England, gave them some grounds to expect a re|establishment of government in the old form, yet these ad|vices were soon succeeded by others which caused them to despair of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>We are far from willingly doing any thing abitrary, but the long want of directions from England for settlement of govern|ment doth weaken our hands.</Q></P>

The 14th of March, Lord Wharton introduced him again to the King,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">King William and Queen Mary were proclaimed 13th Feb.</NOTE> when, after humbly congratulating his Majesty's accession, Mr. Mather implored his Majesty's favor to New England. The King promised all the favor in his power, but hinted what had been irregular in their former government. Whereupon Mr. Mather undertook that, upon the first word, they should reform any irregularities they should be advised of, and Lord Wharton offered to be their guarantee. The King then said, that he would give orders that Sir Edmund Andros should be removed and called to account for his mal-administration, and that the King and Queen should be proclaimed by the former magistrates. Mr. Mather was a faithful agent, and was unwearied in securing friends for his country. Besides several of the nobility and principal commoners, he had engaged the whole body of the dissenting ministers, whose weight, at that time, was far from inconsiderable.</P>
<P>THE family of Ashurst had always been friendly to New-England. The first addresses after the restoration were sent to Mr. Ashurst, Mr. Leveret and Mr. Richard Hutchinson, to be delivered to the King. Sir Henry Ashurst a member of parliament was more particu|larly engaged at this time by Mr. Mather, who de|sired that he might be impowered by the colony to appear as their agent. Mr. Hampden, another member, also shewed great friendship.

The King, from the beginning, discovered a design to reserve the appointment of the gover|nor to himself. It was in vain, after losing this chance in parliament, to try for the restoration of the old charter. A new charter, with as many of the old privileges as could be obtained, was all that could be hoped for. In the mean time, application was made, for express power and autho|rity to be granted to the colony to exercise government according to the old charter, until a new could be settled.

Letters arrived in England, presently after the King's order to the old magistrates, from Sir Edmund Andros, Mr. Dudley, &amp;c. complaining of their usage. Nicholson and Usher came to London also with their complaints, and the Indians falling upon Piscataqua about the same time, it was imputed to the revolution in the Massachusets, and the friends of New-England were afraid the powers would be recalled,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nath.

<P>THE letters did not arrive in New-England until very late in the year, but came very opportunely to calm the commotions which had very much increas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> there. Sir Edmund, his servant having enticed the centinel to drink and then to suffer him to be upon guard in his stead, escaped from the castle and went to Rhode-Island, where Major Sanford stopped him, and sent him back to the castle again.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Leisler, at New-York, was greatly alarmed with Sir Edmund's escape. He writes to the Massachusets governor from New-York Sept. 3d.
<Q>The escape of Sir Edmund and his arrival at Rhode Island, where Col. Dongan did, the same day, land some of his people, and himself not far off, caused a jealousy in us of a bad design. In this interim of time arrived here Mr. John Emerson, John Leverett, William Brattle, Thomas Maccarty, and John Perry, from the ferry, after watch set in the night, well armed, and, as reported, went into a tavern where doors and windows were shut, a man on horseback was dispatched post out of the town, made us all believe them of Sir Edmund's people, and he himself not far off. I sent for the strangers, of whom I demanded a pass, they said they had one, but lost it, they knew no body but Major Brockholt and Capt. Locker, two known papists, whereby I suspected them to be really of Sir Edmund's people and beat the drum. I sent 12 soldiers to search the house for their port|manteaus, two were brought and owned to be theirs. I found about 40 letters, most of them directed to disapprovers of our actions, which caused me to alarm the town, by which alarm I got immediately about 500 men courageously armed, and, while the committee read the letters, I sent out parties to search for strangers, and for the men of the house where they arrived, being persons who never joined with us to watch and fortify, nor armed in any alarm. The letters being read and nothing found, we suspected that those of consequence were gone, and so remained upon our guard. In the morning Mr. Lawrence perused a letter from his grand child, wherein the characters of the said gentle|men were discovered, upon which slender proof and my charity&punc; I ventured to release the said gentlemen, who confessed we had just cause to suspect them, all things falling out as they did.</Q></P>

Elisha Cooke and Thomas Oakes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Oakes was not chosen assistant until May, after they embarked.</NOTE> both of them assistants. Mr. Cooke was a gentle|man of good understanding, and had been well educated, had always adhered stiffly to the old charter, and when all the rest of the assistants declined reassuming it, he alone was in favor of it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This appears from the files of the court.</NOTE> Mr. Oakes was a man of less conse|quence, but attached to the same side, having been some time a representative of the town of Boston, and not of the assistants when they refused to reassume. They were instructed, among other things, to sollicit in parliament, or elsewhere, the confirmation of their ancient charter and
<PB N="394" REF="009705_0202_0F7A46095BC69880">
and all it's rights and privileges, civil and sacred, and, if there should be opportunity, to endeavour the obtaining such farther privileges as might be of benefit to the colony. The agents disagreed, and by this means certain articles in|tended against Sir Edmund were never signed by them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mather said that the Earl of Monmouth told him they had cut the throat of their country in not doing it, but Mr. Cooke's excuse was, Sir John Somers's advice, which he said was against doing it. An enquiry into the conduct of Sir Edmund and the rest, it was designed should be avoided, and this was the reason of Sir John Somers's advice to Mr. Cooke.
<Q>When the agents first appeared before the council, Sir Edmund, Dudley, Randolph, &amp;c. had notice to be present also, and came prepared with a charge against the colony, for rebellion against lawful authority, for im|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">isoning the King's governor, &amp;c. Sir John Somers thereupon said, that the agents were upon the defensive part and were ready to answer any complaints. Sir Robert Sawyer, who had brought the quo warranto, then declaimed largely against the colony for those deeds by which he supposed the charter forfeited, but, in the close, to prevent an answer, acknowledged that what he said was foreign to the present case, and one of the lords said, let us keep to the matter before us. The agents were then required to give the reasons of the opposition to Sir Edmund and his autho|rity. They began with his proclamation and other endeavours to stifle the news of the Prince's landing, and the imprisonment of the person who brought over the declaration. Lord president (Marquis of Carmarthen) asked who imprisoned Sir Edmund and the rest. Sir John Somers replied, the country, my lord, oppressed by an arbitrary government did there as we did here, rose as one man, took the opportunity of the news of the revolution in Eng|land to free themselves from the yoke they were under. Lord president. You say it was the country and the people, that is no body, let us see A B and C, the persons that will make it their case. Here is a charge against the King's governor, but no body has signed the paper. Sir J. Somers. My lord we are here, in be|half of the country, to manage their concerns, and not in the be|half of any particular persons. One of the agents then whispered Sir John, that, if that was a stick, they would sign the paper im|mediately, but he replied no, we are in our way and have follow|ed the direction of the board, and if they will bring us off thus they may. One of the lords said, I perceive the revolution was there as it was here, by the unanimous agreement of the people, for who seized and imprisoned the late lord chancellor, who seized and imprisoned the lord such and such, naming several, and secured the garrison of Hull? &amp;c. I think we understand the matter well enough, and see no reason why we may not go forward with the proof. Another lord spake to the same purpose and said the people were to be commended for what they had done; but lord president applied himself to the agents and said, gentlemen here has been a pretty deal of time spent, my lords will give his Ma|jesty a true and impartial account of what has been said on both sides and wait his Majesty's further pleasure, and you may with|draw for the present. The next day, Sir Edmund and the rest were discharged from any further attendance, and a report being made to his Majesty in council, the same was approved, and the matter was ordered to be dismissed on both sides.</Q>
(<HI>Mr. Cooke's let.</HI>) Thus the agents were diverted by their own council from pursu|ing their instructions and supporting a charge which had been prepared and offered to the lords of the council. It was well known, that it would be most agreeable to have no enquiry made. Lord president's own arbitrary actions, whilst Earl of Danby, for which no satisfaction had been given, would have stared him in the face, and it would not have well consisted with the oblivion intended for what had past at home to have been very strict in enquiring into tyranny in the colonies.</NOTE>

<P>THE Indians of Penicook, upon Merrimack river, in the spring of the year 1689, professing great friendship to Major Waldron, of Quochecho,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In New-Hampshire.</NOTE> were civilly treated by him, and one of their chiefs was lodged in his garrison. The Indian in the night, opened the gate to a great number of Saco and Penicook Indians, who lay hovering round it. They killed the major and twenty two others, and carried away twenty nine captives, and plundered and burnt the neighbouring houses. The authority at Boston were equally anxious for the protection and defence of the people as if they had been within the colony, and sent out forces for their relief. Intelligence arrived, soon after, of mischief done in several parts of the county of York, or province of Main, and, on the 22d of August, the fort at Pemaquid, the command of which (being garrisoned by 14 men only) was given to one Weems, an officer Sir Edmund had left there, was besieged by the Indians. It was so situated as to be overlooked from a rock near to it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Both English and French have fell into the like mistake, in the situation of several forts, built since that time.</NOTE> From thence the Indians galled the garrison to such de|gree, that the next day they capitulated upon terms, which were kept with Indian faith, some of the men being butchered and the others carried captive. There were no hopes of security by sea or land, the French from Quebec instigating the Indians and joining parties with them, and the French from Acadie, by their small privateers, infesting the coasts and taking many vessels. In the winter, therefore, the general court were meditating an attempt both upon Port-Royal and Quebec. Sir William Phips <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Willam Phips was a New-England man, born at Pemaquid in 1650, where he kept sheep until he was 18 years old, then was an apprentice to a ship carpenter. When he was free, he set up his trade and built a ship at Sheepscote. After that, he followed the sea, and hearing of a Spanish wreck near the Bahamas, he gave such an account of it in England, that in 1683, he was appointed commander of one of the King's frigates, the Algier Rose, of 18 guns, and went in search of it, but failed. Soon after, being fitted out by the Duke of Albemarle upon a second voyage, he was more successful, and bro't home a treasure of near three hundred thousand pounds, his own share being about sixteen thousand pounds only. The King knighted him. He was soon after appointed high sheriff of New-England, which he accepted with a view to serve his country, under a tyrannical government, but he could do no service, and was in England again in 1688. King James, about the time of his abdication, offered him the government of New-England. It was not a time to accept of it. Sir William had the character of an honest man. His education was very low. He was of a hasty temper, and being a stout man, he would use his cane and fist after he was governor. Some in|stances of this sort with a captain of a man of war and a collector occasioned complaints against him in England, which he was sent for to answer, and so far justified or excused his past conduct, that he was returning to his government, when he fell sick and died, and was buried in St. Mary Woolnoth church, London. By a series of fortunate incidents, rather than by any uncommon talents, he rose from the lowest condition i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> life to be the first man in his country.</NOTE>

Sir William took possession (as appears by his journal) of the whole sea coast, from Port-Royal to Penobscot and the New England settlements. The plunder was thought equal to the whole expence. But this was conjecture. The acquisition was so easy, that the court were confirmed in the prosecution of their design upon Canada. Besides, the ravages began upon the frontiers by French and Indians, assoon as the spring opened, made it appear more necessary than ever.

But their hands were too full in England to give any attention to this proposal. The Massachusets, however, determined to proceed, and Connecticut and New-York engaged to furnish a body of men. Two thousand were expected to march by Lake Champlain and attack Montreal, at the same time that the forces by sea should be before Quebec. It was late in the season to undertake this great affair, but they tarried longer than otherwise they would have done, in expectation of the stores they had sent for to England. None arriving, the 9th of August the fleet sailed from Nanta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ket. There were between thirty and forty vessels, great and small, the largest of 44 guns and 200 men, perhaps not of superior strength to a sixth rate man of war, the whole number of men about two thou|sand. They did not arrive before Quebec until the 5th of October. Great dependance was had upon a division of the French force, but it happened, most unfortunately, that the forces designed against Montreal had retreated, and the news of it had reached Montreal before the fleet arrived at Quebec, so that Count Frontenac, the French general, was able to employ the whole strength of Canada against this little army.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When a plan is thus formed, consisting of various parts, upon the due execution of every one of which the success of the whole de|pends, it must give great pain to men, who have not lost all feel|ing, not to have it in their power to perform the parts assigned them, and much greater to have been guilty of neglect or un|faithfulness. It is difficult, at this day, to ascertain the cause of the New-York and Connecticut forces failing. A letter from Boston to London, Nov. 24th 1690, says,
<Q>That the enemy had notice of our coming very long before we could get at them, and whereas we had laid in beforehand that the five nations of the western Indians, with a party of English from Connecticut and Albany, should by land alarm the French quarters about Mont|real; it fell out that, when these were upon their march, some that therein served the French interests, by their wiles, decoyed them into a retreat that proved unlucky for us.</Q>
The distracted state of the government of New-York, one party determined to ruin the public interest if the other had engaged in it, must have contributed to this disappointment. Leisler writes in a rage to governor Bradstreet, Sept. 15th 1690,
<Q>I have used all argu|ments and means possible to reinforce for Canada, but by Major Winthrop's treachery and cowardice, with the rest of his tools, hath rendered the work altogether impracticable, his errand be|ing so far effected as to leave us in a weaker state than he found us.

upon the spirits of the English forces, and they could have but little hopes of succeeding. Le Hontan, a French writer, says, the general was at Montreal when he heard the news of the fleet's being in the river, and that, if the English had made their descent before his arrival at Quebec, or two days after, they would have carried the place without striking a blow, there not being 200 French in the city, which lay open and exposed on all hands, but that they lost three days in consulting, before they came to a resolution. Success is wisdom with mankind in general. From the ill success of this undertaking, both English and French writers have treated it with ridicule and peculiar contempt. The next morning after the fleet arrived, Sir William sent a summons ashore. If it was too pompous, the answer was too insolent. The English were called hereticks and traitors, and told, that if it had not been for the revolution, New-England and Canada would have been all one. The French say, the major who car|ried the summons was threatned with a gibbet, and had like to have swooned. No notice is taken of this in the English journals, and it is not likely to be true. An

The forces continued ashore until the 11th, rather upon the defensive, when they embarked with pre|cipitation. A council of war was called the next day, and proposals were made for another attempt, after a few days refreshment for the men; but tempestuous weather came on, which drove some of the vessels from their anchors and scattered the whole fleet, and they made the best of their way back to Boston, where Sir William arrived the 19th of November. Some of the fleet were blown off to the West-Indies, one was lost upon Anticosta, and two or three were wrecked or never heard of. It appears by manuscript letters, that about two hundred men were lost by the enemy and sickness.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir William says in his representation to King William that he did not lose above 30 men by the enemy.</NOTE> The small pox, which pre|vailed in Boston before they sailed, had got into the army.

Walley, who had the command of the land forces, gave in a journal of his proceedings to the general court. His conduct was censured by particular persons, but there was no public enquiry.</P>

The soldiers were upon the point of mutiny for want of their wages.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arma tenenti, omnia dat, qui justa negat.</NOTE> It was utterly impracticable to raise, in a few days, such a sum of money as would be necessary. An act was passed for levying the sum, but the men could not stay until it should be brought into the treasury. The extreme difficulty, to which the government was thus reduced, was the occasion of the first bills of credit ever issued in the colonies, as a substitute in the place of money.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barbados was the first which followed the example. Mr. Wood|bridge a New-England man was the projector. Their bills sank so low that the island was in confusion and they soon abolished them. All the colonies upon the continent, Nova Scotia excepted, have first or last, with very different success, gone into the same substitute. It may be made a query whether the project of a land bank in England in the reign of King William, which en|tirely failed, was not taken from this expedient of New-England.</NOTE> The debt was paid by paper notes from two shillings to ten pounds denomination, which notes were to be received for payment of the tax which was to be levied, and all other payments in the treasury. This was a new experiment. They had better credit than King James's leather money in Ireland, about the same time. But the notes would not command money, nor any commodities at money price. Sir William Phips, it is said, exchanged a large sum, at par, in order to give them credit. The soldiers in general were great sufferers, and could get no more than twelve or fourteen shillings in the pound. As the time of payment of the tax approached, the credit of the notes was raised, and the government allowing five per cent. to those who paid their taxes in notes, they became better than money. This was gain to the possessor, but it did not restore to the poor soldier what he had lost by the discount.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The government&punc; encouraged by the restoration of credit to their bills, afterward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> issued others for charges of government. They obtained good credit at the time of their being issued. The charges of government were paid in this manner from year to year. Whilst the sum was small, silver continued the measure, and bills continued their value. When the charges of government encreased after the second expedition to Canada in 1711&punc; the bills likewise encreased, and in the same or greater proportion the silver and gold were sent out of the country. There being a cry of scarcity of money in 1714, the government caused 50,000 l. to be issued, and in 1716, 100,000 l. and lent to the inhabitants, to be paid in at a certain period, and in the mean time to pass as money. Lands were mortgaged for security. Assoon as the silver and gold were gone and the bills were the sole instrument of commerce, pounds shillings and pence were altogether ideal, for no possible reason could be assigned why a bill of twenty shillings should bear a certain proportion to any one quantity of silver more than another: Sums in bills were drawing into the trea|sury from time to time by the taxes or payment of the loans, but then other sums were continually issuing out, and all the bills were paid and received without any distinction either in public or pri|vate payments, so that, for near forty years together, the currency was in much the same state as if a hundred thousand pounds ster|ling had been stamped in pieces of leather or paper of various denominations and declared to be the money of the government without any other sanction than this, that, when there should be taxes to pay, the treasury would receive this sort of money, and that every creditor should be obliged to receive it from his debtor. Can it be supposed that such a medium could retain its value? In 1702, 6s. 8d. was equal to an ounce of silver. In 1749, 50s. was judged equal to an ounce of silver. I saw a five shilling bill which had been issued in 1690 and was remaining in 1749, and was then equal to eight pence only in lawful money, and so retained but about one eighth of its original value. Such was the delusion, that not only the bills of the Massachusets government passed as money, but they received the bills of the government of Connecticut New-Hampshire and Rhode Island also as a currency. The Massachusets bills passed also in those governments. In 1749 bills of credit were abolished, and unless the evils which they oc|casioned should be forgotten, the government, it must be presumed, will never issue any more.</NOTE> Sir William Phips, after a few weeks tarry in

They found themselves surrounded with Indians; about 50 of the English were killed upon the spot, and near an hundred captivated. The minister, Shubael Dummer, who was in great esteem, was shot dead, as he was mounting his horse at his door, and his wife and family made prisoners.

<Q>May it please your lordships, in obedience to your order of reference, I have perused this draught and I conceive their Majesties may erect such a cor|poration (as is here purported) and enable them to purchase such lands and exercise government in the same. But the clause of confiscating the ships and goods of their Majesties subjects who shall trade to such place without the company's permission will not be good in law. Also some clauses, particularly about the oaths and courts and officers, need be more clearly and intelligi|bly penned. Geo. Treby, Aug. 25th 1690.</Q></P>
<P>By this charter, certain persons were to be made a corporation, capa|ble in law to plead and be impleaded, &amp;c. and to acquire and purchase lands goods and chattels of the several natives and other inhabitants of that part of the continent of America lying and being in breadth from 36 &frac12; degrees of north latitude, which is the northerly bounds of Carolina, to 46 &frac12; degrees of north lati|tude, and in length from the pacific ocean, otherwise called the south sea, unto the westerly bounds of the English colonies of New-York, New-Jersey, Pensylvania, Maryland and the heads of the great rivers, in a certain ridge of mountains, separating the colony of Virginia from the rest of the continent, which runs into the bay of Chesipeak and from thence into the atlantic ocean, to|gether with all islands, lakes, quarries, mines, &amp;c. and all appur|tenances whatsoever, to hold use and to give grant and dispose of the same in as ample manner as any other corporation within the realm of England might or could do.</P>
<P>The governor deputy-governor and assistants were to be annually chosen by the company in England.</P>
<P>They had power to cause to be transported subjects and strangers also goods chattels and merchandize.</P>
<P>None were to inhabit or dwell within the bounds of the patent or to trade with the natives without leave of the corporation.</P>
<P>All who should go thither or be born there to have the liberty of free and natural born subjects.</P>
<P>Power to establish provinces, counties, cities, towns, districts and jurisdictions as should be thought fit.</P>
<P>Under their common seal in the King's name to appoint judges, justices, sheriffs, constables and all other officers civil and military.</P>
<P>By such commanders, governors and officers as should be appointed by the corporation, to erect forts, &amp;c. to assemble and put in war|like posture the inhabitants, and to encounter by sea and land all persons invading annoying, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A general court established, each city or borough to send two mem|bers, with power to make laws, &amp;c. for the royal approbation, to raise taxes for the support and defence of the colony.</P>
<P>Free liberty of conscience to all the inhabitants.</P></NOTE> when it was objected, that,

<Q>if the agents were not satisfied therewith, they should bring in their objections to the attorney general.</Q>
Mr. Mather was so dissatisfied, that he declared he would sooner part with his life than con|sent

<Q>the consent of the agents was not desired; the agents of New-England were not plenipotentiaries from a sovereign state; if they declared they would not submit to the King's pleasure, his Majesty would settle the country, and they might take what would follow.</Q>
Sir Henry Ashurst, with Mr. Mather, drew up, notwithstanding, their objections against the minutes, insist|ing upon the King's promise, and that charters might as well be refused to be restored to any of the corporations in Eng|land, where they had been taken away, as to New-England.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hampden, upon this occasion, desired the opinion of Mr. Hooke, a counsellor of note, which he gave as follows:</P>
<P>"There are two parties which sollicit the affairs of New-England.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those who labour for an union of the whole territory under a captain-general, who should govern by commission from the King, without any respect to former charters.</P>
<P>Against this party it is justly objected, that a people, who some years since left their native country for the sake of their con|sciences, and adventured to inhabit a wilderness, which had just before been swept of its inhabitants by a dreadful plague, who had added so many of the heathen to the inheritance of our blessed Savior, which no other christian planters have done, who have added so great a territory to the English empire, and are so useful to all other English plantations, who, rather than break with England, submitted to the Turkish commission of Sir Edmund Andros, and who have maintained civility beyond any other people on earth, I say, that such a people should have their whole constitution overturned by a new sort of government, would be hard and unreasonable. That for the present government to do all this, by taking advantage of the arbitrary and justly exploded proceedings of the last reign, would be scandalous and dishonorable.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other party labour to have the several charters of the re|spective colonies restored.</P>
<P>Against them, it is justly objected, that a bare restoration of their charters, and especially of the Massachusets, would be of no ser|vice at all, as appears both from the charter itself and the practice of that colony, who have hardly pursued the terms thereof in any one instance, which hath given colour to evil minded men to give them disturbance&punc;</P>

<P N="2">2. Power to lay taxes and raise money, especially on inhabi|tants not being of the company, and strangers coming to or trading thither.</P>

<P>A middle way, therefore, seems most desireable, viz. that new charters be granted to the respective colonies, wherein the for|mer to be recited, and the proceedings against them respectively, and a new grant made, in terminis, by the words grant and con|firm, and reciting the deficiency in the former charter, all those powers may be vested in the government of the Massachusets for the time being; and the colonies which have no charters to be annexed to the Massachusets colony," &amp;c.</P></NOTE> The objections were presented to the attorney general

<P><Q><P>The foregoing went by Capt.

<BIBL><HI>Cotton to Increase Mather.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> Mr. Addington, the secretary, was at that time secretary to the colony. The emoluments of that office were small, compared with the duty, and so he was in less danger of a competitor. The 28 counsellors were persons of the best characters in the several parts of the colonies, of which, by the charter, they were to be inhabitants or proprietors. Several who had been of the assistants chosen by the people, were left out of the number, Mr. Cooke in particular, also Thomas Danforth, William Browne, William Johnson, John Smith, Thomas Oakes, and Jeremiah Swayne. All these, except Mr. Browne, who was supposed to have been too com|pliant with Sir Edmund, were rigidly attached to the old charter, and Mr. Mather, no doubt, expected they would appear in opposition to the acceptance of the new; for, however extraordinary it may appear, the people of the country were far from being unanimous in submitting to it, expecting, that if it should be refused, they might main|tain their right to their old privile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. They thought it would be a singular hard case, that the effects of the late despotism must be felt by them alone, of all their Ma|jesties subjects, all other charters, whether there had been judgments against them, or whether there had been a surrender only, being, by one means or other, restored. But, it was said, there was this difference between the case of the Massachusets and most of the other charters. In general, there was no room for legal exception to the powers exercised by the corporations, but the Massachusets charter not being intended, when it was granted, for such government as is necessary to be exercised in a colony
<PB N="415" REF="009705_0212_0F7A461256C8F648">
remote from its mother country, a reversion of the former judgment would have been of no service; and Sir George Treby declared to Mr. Mather, Sir John Somers and the two Lords chief justices being present and assenting to it, that
<Q>if the judgment against the charter should be re|versed, and the government should exercise those powers which, before the quo warranto, they had done, a new writ would issue out against them in Westminster-hall, and there would be a judgment against them, and such an one as that there would be no room for a writ of error.</Q>
By the old charter, it was said, they had power to im|prison or inflict punishment, in criminal cases, according to the course of corporations in England, but that, unless capital cases be expressly mentioned, the power would not reach them; that no power was given to erect judicatories or courts for probate of wills, or with admiralty jurisdiction, nor any power to constitute a house of deputies or repre|sentatives, nor to impose taxes on the inhabitants, nor to incorporate towns, colleges, schools, &amp;c. which powers and privileges had been, notwithstanding, usurped. Whether many of the corporations in England had not deviated as much from their original constitution, and whether par|ticular persons are not punishable for usurpations, and not the corporation itself extinguished or dissolved, as was urged in the case of the city of London, it is not necessary to determine. Seventy years practice under a new charter, in many respects to be preferred to the old, has taken away, not only all expectation, but all desire of ever re|turning to the old charter. We do not envy the neigh|bouring governments which retained, and have ever since practised upon, their ancient charters. Many of the most sensible men in those governments would be glad to be under the same constitution that the Massachusets province happily enjoys.</P>
<P>SIR William Phips arrived at Boston, with the charter, the 14th of May 1692. He issued writs for a general assembly, which met the 8th of June following.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="009705_0213_0F7A4613035F3C48">ALTHOUGH a party was formed which opposed a submission to the charter, yet a majority of the court wisely and thankfully accepted it, and appointed a day of solemn thanksgiving to Almighty God, for

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Ecclesiastical Constitution of the Colony, and the special Religious Customs.</HEAD>
<P>IT was one great design of the first planters of the Massachusets colony to obtain for themselves and their posterity the liberty of worshipping God in such manner as appeared to them to be most agreeable to the sacred scriptures. Whilst they remained in Eng|land they continued in the communion of the church, such of them excepted as were excluded from it for nonconformity to some of the ceremonies. With some of the ceremonial parts of worship they were all more or less dissatisfied. The canons or laws of the church, and the rigid execution of them&punc; they accounted a grievous burden. The form of government in the church was not a general subject of complaint. They were very careful to distin|guish themselves from the Brownists and other separatists. Had they remained in England and the church been governed with the wisdom and moderation of the present day, they would have remained, to use their own expres|sion,
<Q>in the bosom of that church where they had re|ceived their hopes of salvation.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The son of one of the first ministers, in a preface to a sermon preached soon after the revolution, remarks
<Q>that if the bishops in the reign of King Charles the first had been of the same spirit with those in the reign of King William, there would have been no New-England.</Q></NOTE> They were of the same stamp with Doctor Preston, Doctor Sibbs, Mr. Hil|dersham, Rogers, Dod and other old puritants, who though called nonconformists, yet I suppose never separated, but refrained from such ceremonies and such parts of the liturgy only as they scrupled to use. However, they did not sup|pose the form of episcopal government to be enjoined by divine authority so as to make it unlawful to submit to, or to establish any other form. They knew very well that
<PB N="418" REF="009705_0214_0F7A4613C5F3B650">
upon their arrival in America they would be no longer subject to any diocesan in England, but they took no mea|sures for the establishment of episcopacy under any re|strictions or limitations by royal or national authority. They must, however, have supposed some form or other of church government would be necessary, but they were far from being determined what it should be. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hubbard.</HI></NOTE>Mr. Hil|dersham advised them to agree upon it before they left England, but it was neglected; perhaps it was impracticable. They knew how far Mr. Endicot had proceeded in form|ing the first church, and how much it resembled the con|stitution of the separatists at Plimouth, and soon after the news of it, one company who were designed for New-England, formed themselves into a church in the new hos|pital at Plimouth, and John Warham and John Maverick were chosen and ordained their ministers. Both of them had before been ordained by bishops. The separatists used to boast that
<Q>if the old puritans were secure of the magis|trate's sword and might go on with his good licence, they would shake off the prelate's yoke and draw no longer in spiritual communion with all the profane in the land, and though they then preached and wrote against the separatists, yet if they were in a place where they might have their liberty they would do as they did.</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Robinson&mdash;Bradford.</HI></NOTE> The inconveniencies we suffer under one extreme, it must be allowed, carry us in|sensibly into the other. The New-England puritans, when at full liberty, went the full length which the separatists did in England. It does not follow that they would have done so if they had remained in England. Upon their removal, they supposed their relation both to the civil and ecclesiastical government, except so far as a special reserve was made by their charter, was at an end, and that they had right to form such new model of both as best pleased them. In the form of worship, they universally followed the New-Plimouth church. I find a common prayer book among the list of books presented by William Backhouse for the use of the ministers, but it was never made use of in any

church. The first notice, after the charter, of any step to|wards forming themselves into a church estate was, upon oc|casion of great sickness and mortality, about a month after their arrival, when the governor, at Charlestown, wrote to Mr. Johnson at Salem, to set apart a day to humble them|selves and seek God in his ordinances, and solemnly to enter into covenant with him, and as they lived in three<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Prince supposes the three to be Dorchester, Charlestown and Salem.

His praise was in all the churches, as the prin|cipal projector of the plan of government of the New-England churches, which, from that time, took the name of congregational. This was called the middle way be|tween brownism and presbyterianism, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard.</NOTE> and is said to be distinguished by four characteristicks, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1st. THE subject matter of the visible church, viz. saints by calling, such as are acquainted with the principles of religion, and who profess their faith, and the manner

<P N="2">2d. THE constitutive part of a particular visible church ought to be, a restipulation or mutual covenanting to walk together in their christian communion, according to the rule of the gospel.</P>
<P N="3">3d. No church ought to be of larger extent or grea|ter number than may ordinarily meet together in one place, for the enjoyment of all the same numerical ordinances and celebrating all divine worship, nor fewer, ordinarily, than conveniently may carry on church work.</P>

<P>AN odious sense had been affixed to the name of inde|pendents, which seems to have been the reason why it was avoided, rather than any material distinction in the constitution of the churches which appears or can be inferred from either of those characteristicks; but the platform, agreed upon and published in 1648, although it does not own that dependance which shall subject any one church to any other, or even to the whole united toge|ther, yet it professes a relation which one church hath to another,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We may see something of the relation the churches considered themselves in, one to another, before the platform in 1647, by the following letter from the church of Salem to the church of Dor|chester.</P>

<P>IN general, the ordination of ministers was by imposi|tion of the hands of their brethren in the ministry, but some churches, perhaps to preserve a more perfect in|dependency, called for the aid of no ministers of any other churches, but ordained their ministers by the imposition of the hands of some of their own brethren.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>This is said by Bailey to be Brownism.</P>

at Salem, August 29th 1660, was performed in this manner, as I find minuted by a gentleman then just ar|rived from England, who was present. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have seen an account of an ordination about the year 1640, of Mr. Hooke, at Taunton, then Cohannet, in Plimouth colony, by the schoolmaster and one of the brethren, an husbandman, altho' Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mather, two ministers, were present, but the general practice was otherwise, and at this day an ordi|nation by the lay brethren, altho' it might not be condemned as invalid, yet would be generally disapproved and discountenanced.</NOTE>
<Q>The church at Salem kept this day as a fast for the ordaining a teacher and a ruling elder. Mr. Higginson preached in the morning, continuing until one o'clock, then broke off for one hour, then, the congregation being assembled again, they went to the work of the ordination, which was thus&mdash;first Mr. Higginson who was to be ordained teaching elder prayed, after prayer, Major Hathorne a private member, being, it seems, desired by the church, stood up and spake to the brethren of the church that they should now if they did continue in the mind they were in before as to the choice of Mr. Higginson for their pastor declare their consent by silence; and then spake to Mr. Higginson to declare his acceptance, and then spake to the messengers of the churches that were sent to be present, and to all others, to speak if they knew any weighty reasons against their proceeding to ordination, and then, none speaking, MajorHathorne and two of the deacons of the church, laying their hands on Mr. Higginson's head, pronounced words of ordination and prayed over him, and then Major Hathorne ex|horted the church in a few words to remember their duty, &amp;c. towards him whom they had ordained to be their pastor. Then Mr. Higginson did after the same manner as is before expressed, proceed to the ordination of Mr. Brown for the ruling elder, which being done they sung a psalm and concluded with prayer. After the exercise I was invited to the elder's house, where was good company and good cheer.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="009705_0218_0F7A46179B11E6B0">MOST of the churches, not all, had one or more ruling elder. In matters of offence, the ruling elder, after the hearing, asked the church if they were satisfied; if they were not, he left it to the pastor or teacher to denounce the sentence of excommunication, suspension or admonition, according as the church had determined. Matters of of|fence, regularly, were first brought to the ruling elder in private, and might not otherwise be told to the church. It was the practice for the ruling elders to give public notice of such persons as desired to enter into church fel|lowship with them, and of the time proposed for admit|ting them, if no sufficient objection was offered; and when the time came, to require all persons who knew any just grounds of objection to signify them. Objections were fre|quently made, and until they were heard and determined, the ruling elder seems to have moderated in the church, but the churches consent to the admission was asked by the pastor or teacher, who also rehearsed and proposed the church covenant and declared them members. When a minister preached to any other than his own church, the ruling elder of the church, after the psalm sung, said pub|licly,
<Q>if this present brother hath any word of exhorta|tion for the people at this time, in the name of God let him say on.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lechford.</NOTE> The ruling elder always read the psalm. When the member of one church desired to receive the sacrament at another, he came to the ruling elder who proposed his name to the church for their consent. At the communion they sat with the minister. I find nothing further relating to this officer in their public assemblies. They were considered, without doors, as men for advice and counsel in religious matters, they visited the sick, and had a general inspection and oversight of the conduct of their brethren. Every thing which I have mentioned as the peculiar province of the ruling elder, so far as it is in itself necessary or proper, may with propriety enough be performed by the minister. It is not strange therefore that this office in a course of years sunk into almost an entire desuetude in the churches. Indeed the multiplying
<PB N="427" REF="009705_0218_0F7A46179B11E6B0">
unnecessary and mere nominal officers, or officers whose duties and privileges are not with certainty agreed upon and determined, seems rather to have a natural tendency to discord and contention than to harmony and peace.</P>
<P>WE meet with nothing peculiar, in the beginning of the churches, relative to the office of deacons. Mention is made of the duty of deaconesses or widows, who were
<Q>to shew mercy with chearfulness, and to minister to the sick and poor brethren,</Q>
but I find no instance of any specially chosen or appointed to this service.</P>
<P>THE ministers of the several churches in the town of Boston have ever been supported by a free weekly con|tribution. I have seen a letter from one of the principal ministers of the colony expressing some doubts of the law|fulness of receiving a support in any other way. In the country towns, compulsory laws were found necessary; and in the year 1654 the county courts were impowered to assess upon the inhabitants of the several towns which neg|lected the support of the ministry a sum sufficient to make up the defect.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In 1644 one Briscoe a tanner of Watertown, published a book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the support of ministers by tithes or taxes, and reproached the ministers who took salaries in that way.

<P>IN Boston, after prayer and before singing, it was the practice for several years for the minister to read and ex|pound a chapter. Whether it was because this carried the service to too great a length, or any other reason could be given for it, in a few years it was laid aside, except when it came in place of a sermon.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>To preach a sermon which was not composed by the preacher himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, was loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d upon, if no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> criminal, yet highly disreputable.

The other parts of reli|gious public worship, and the manner of administring the sacraments, not differing from what is at this day the practice of the churches of New-England and of the church of Scotland, it is unnecessary to take any notice of them.</P>
<P>FROM a sacred regard to the religion of the christian sabbath, a scruple arose of the lawfulness of calling the first day of the week Sunday, and they always, upon any occasion, whether in a civil or religious relation to it, stiled it either the Lord's-day or the Sabbath. As the exception to the word Sunday was founded upon its su|perstitious idolatrous origin, the same scruple naturally followed with respect to the names of all the other days of the week, and of most of the months, which had the same origin; accordingly; they changed Monday, Tuesday, &amp;c. into the second and third days of the week, and in|stead of March and April, used the first and second months, and instead of the third Tuesday in May, the language was, the third third day of the third month, and so of the rest.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a scruple of the Brownists.</NOTE> All their records and other writings are dated in the common form, which they brought from England with them, until the year 1636, when Mr. Vane was go|vernor, but after that, the alteration seems to have been very strictly observed in all public and private writings and discourse for many years together. In the interregnum it much obtained in England, but the scruple there went off at once, upon the restoration, here, it abated, and it con|tinues scarce any where at this day, except among the people called Quakers. Perhaps the great dislike to some other peculiarities of that people caused the decline of that custom in the colony, and made them consider the singularity in the same light with some others of the same nature, which they condemned.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They began the Sabbath the evening of the last day of the week. It was some time before this custom was settled. Mr. Hooker, in a letter without date, but wrote about the year 1640, says,
<Q>The question touching the beginning of the sabbath is now on foot among us, hath once been spoken to, and we are to give in our arguments each to the other, so that we may ripen our thoughts touching that truth, and if the Lord will it may more fully appear.</Q>
And in another letter, March 1640,
<Q>Mr. Huit hath not answered our arguments against the beginning the sabbath at morning.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="009705_0219_0F7A461839A9B418">THAT every thing approaching to an acknowledg|ment of the authority of the pope and his power of canonization might be avoided, they never used the addition of saint when they spake of the apostles and the ancient fathers of the christian church, and even the usual names of places were made to conform. The Island of Saint Christophers was always wrote Christophers, and by the same rule all other places to which saint had been prefixed. If any exception was made, an answer was ready: Abra|ham, Isaac and Jacob had as good right to this appellation as Peter, James and John.</P>
<P>THEY laid aside the fasts and feasts of the church of England, and appointed frequently, as occasion required, days of fasting and thanksgiving, but, besides these occa|sional fasts and thanksgivings, they constantly, every spring, appointed a day for fasting and prayer to implore the divine blessings upon their affairs in the ensuing year; and in the fall, a day of thanksgiving and public acknowledg|ment of the favors confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed upon them in the year past. If they more readily fell into this practice from the ex|ample of the people of God of old, yet they might well have been justified without any example. It has continued without interruption, I suppose, in any one instance, down to this day. This is a custom to which no devout person of any sect will take exception. By a law of the colony, every person absenting himself from the public worship, on these days, without sufficient excuse, was liable to five shil|lings fine. It would have been as well, perhaps, if this provision had been omitted.</P>
<P>THESE were the principal of the special ecclesiastical or religious customs. There were some attempts to intro|duce
<PB N="430" REF="009705_0220_0F7A461ADA90E740">
singularities into some of the churches, particularly, Mr. Davenport of New-Haven, who afterwards re|moved to Boston, required all his congregation to stand up whilst the text was naming; the principal reason which was given for it being, that it was the word of God and deserved peculiar honor;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>At Quinnipyack (New-Haven) Mr. Davenport preached in the forenoon that men must be uncovered and stand up at the reading the text, and in the afternoon the assembly jointly practised it.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>Mr. Hooker to Shepard, March</HI> 20. 1640.</BIBL></NOTE> and Mr. Williams of Salem re|quired all the women of his congregation to wear veils; but neither of these customs spread, or were of any long continuance. It was observed, as to the latter, that so un|couth an appearance, contrary to the practice of the Eng|lish nation, would probably draw more eyes than if they were dressed like other women. Mr. Cotton of Boston, happening to preach at Salem, soon after this custom began, he convinced his hearers that it had no sufficient founda|tion in the scriptures: The married women had no pre|tence to wear veils as virgins, neither married nor un|married would chuse to do it from the example of Tamar th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> harlot, nor need they do it for such purpose as Ruth did in her widowhood. His sermon had so good an effect that they were all ashamed of their veils and never ap|peared covered with them afterwards.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hubbard.</HI> Mr. Cotton, when he was in England, thought more favorably of this custom. He mentions the old countess of Lincol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her always coming to church veiled.</NOTE></P>
<P>DURING the fifty years the charter continued, there were very few instances of any society of christians differing, professedly, in doctrine, discipline or form of worship from the established churches. The number of baptists was small. The quakers came over in small parties, but not|withstanding the strange delusion they were under in courting persecution, and the imprudence of the authority in gratifying this humor as far as their utmost wishes could carry them, as has been observed in the course of the history, yet they were never numerous enough to form a society of any consequence, except upon the bor|ders
<PB N="431" REF="009705_0220_0F7A461ADA90E740">
of Rhode Island.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The sanguinary laws were of short continuance, otherwise the number of quakers would have encreased.</NOTE> Nor was there any episcopal church in any part of the colony until the charter was vacated.</P>
<P>THE test, which we have just mentioned, went a great way towards producing this general uniformity. He that did not conform was deprived of more civil privileges than a nonconformist is deprived of by the test in England. Both the one and the other must have occasioned much formality and hypocrisy. The mysteries of our holy re|ligion have been prostituted to meer secular views and ad|vantages. Besides this test, another reason may be assigned. As good if not better lands than any in the colony lay contiguous to it, and men of different opinions chose to remove where they might enjoy both civil and religious liberty, rather than remain and be deprived of either. In this way, birth and quick growth were given to a neighbouring colony, which admitted persons of all religions, and gave equal privileges to all, and as soon as what they called a sectary sprang up in the Massachusets colony it was trans|planted to Rhode Island.</P>
<P>I shall finish what I have to say upon the ecclesiastical constitution of the colony with a short summary of the platform, as I find it prepared by a very sensible divine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hubbard.</NOTE> who made a figure in the colony soon after the platform was established.</P>
<P N="1">1. "ECCLESIASTICAL policy, church government or church discipline, is nothing else but that form and order which is to be observed in the church of Christ upon earth, both for the constitution of it and all the admini|strations which therein are to be performed, the parts of which are all of them described in the word of God, and it is not left in the power of any to alter, add, or diminish any thing therein.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE is a catholic visible church, viz. the company of those who profess the christian faith, whether in church
<PB N="432" REF="009705_0221_0F7A461BC8B72BB0">
order or not; but there is no political catholic church, the state of the members of the visible church, since the coming of Christ, being only congregational.</P>
<P N="3">3. A congregational church, by the institution of Christ, is a part of the visible church, consisting of a company of saints by calling, united into one body by an holy cove|nant for the public worship of God and the mutual edifi|cation one of another in the fellowship of the Lord Jesus; the matter of which, as to its qualification, ought to consist of such persons as have attained the knowledge of the principles of religion, who are free from gross scandal, and with the profession of their faith and repentance walk in blameless obedience to the word of God; as to its quantity, it ought not to be of greater number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one place, nor fewer than may conveniently carry on church work. The form of such a church is an agreement, consent or visible covenant, whereby they give themselves unto the Lord to the ob|serving the ordinances of Christ together in the same society.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE fraternity or brotherhood of such a church is the first subject of all ordinary church power, which is either a power of office or of privi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But the power of privilege is in the brethren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and immediately, the other is in them no otherwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that they design the persons unto office, who only are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and exercise that power.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE ordinary officers of the church are such as concern their spiritual and moral, or temporal and natural good. Of the first of which are pastors, teachers, ruling elders, 1 Tim. v.17. In the last mentioned, most of the churches in New-England, as many of the congregational churches elsewhere, are not so well agreed, accounting ruling elders should be able to teach.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is in the power of the churches to call their own officers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve them from their office again, if there fall out just cause, yet so as the advice of neighbour churches, where it may conveniently be done, be first had.
<PB N="433" REF="009705_0221_0F7A461BC8B72BB0">
They who are to officiate ought to be tried and proved before they be elected. 1 Tim. v.22.</P>
<P N="7">7. ELD<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">RS are to be ordained by imposition of hands, which is to be performed by the elders of the same church, if it be furnished with any, or those of neighbour churches, and it may be done by some of the brethren deputed thereunto, which latter is also disapproved by Dr. Horn|beck, the learned professor of divinity at Leyden, from Numb. viii.10.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE power of government in a congregational church ought to proceed after the manner of a mixed administration; for, in an organick church, no act can be consummate without the consent both of the elders and brethren, so as the power of government or rule in the elders prejudice not the power of privilege in the bre|thren, nor the power of privilege in them prejudice the power of rule seated in the elders, seeing both may sweetly agree together.</P>
<P N="9">9. FOR the maintenance of the ministers of the church, all that are taught are to communicate to him that teach|eth, in all good things, and in case of neglect, the magi|strate ought to see that the ministry be duly provided for.</P>
<P N="10">10. FOR the admission of members, there ought to be either a personal relation in publick, or by the elders ac|quainting the church what satisfaction they have received from the persons in private. The things wherein satis|faction is required are faith and repentance, which ought to be found in all church members.</P>
<P N="11">11. WHERE members of churches are called to remove from one church to another, it is convenient, for order sake, that it be done by letters of recommendation or of dismission.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE censures of the church, which are for the preventing, removing, or healing offences, are excommu|nication or admonition, wherein the church ought to pro|ceed according to the rule, Matt. xviii.15, 16, 17. wherein the offence is to be brought to the church by the mouth of the elders.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="434" REF="009705_0222_0F7A461C07580CF8">13. PARTICULAR churches, although they are distinct and have not one power over another, yet, because they are united unto Christ, not only as a mystical but as a po|litical head, they ought to have communion one with another, by way of mutual care, consultation, admonition, and participation in the same ordinances.</P>
<P N="14">14. SYNODS, orderly assembled and rightly proceeding according to the pattern of Acts xv, are the ordinance of Christ, and, if not absolutely necessary to the being, yet necessary to the well being of churches, for the establish|ment of peace and truth therein. And many churches may so assemble together by their messengers and elders. And their directions and determinations&punc; so far as conso|nant to the word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission, not only for their agreement therewith, without which they bind not at all, but also for the power whereby they are made, as an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his word.</P>
<P N="15">15. CHURCH government and civil government may very well stand together, it being the duty of the magi|strate to take care of matters of religion, and to improve his civil authority for observing the duties commanded in the first as well as in the second table, seeing the end of their office is not only the quiet and peaceable life of the subject in matters of righteousness and honesty, but also in matters of godliness. 1 Tim. ii.1, 2."</P>
<P>AFTER all that may be said in favor of the constitution, the strength of it lay in the union, declared in the last article, with the civil authority. The usual way of de|ciding differences and controversies in churches, it is true, was by a council consisting of the elders and other messen|gers of neighbouring churches, and where there was a general agreement in such councils, the contending parties generally acquiesced, but if the council happened to differ in apprehensions among themselves, or if either of the contending parties were contumacious, it was a common thing for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivil magistrate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o interpose and put an end to the dispute.</P>

The supreme authority being in the court of assistants, they re|solved upon frequent meetings for the due execution of it. As it was necessary for every family to provide lodgings before winter, the first law proposed and passed was for the regulating the price of wages of workmen, under a penalty to him that gave as well as to him who received more than the limited price.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carpenters, joyners, bricklayers, sawyers and thatchers not more than 2 s. per day, &amp;c.</NOTE> They proceeded to other laws for punishing idleness and encouraging industry; and, as they were in the midst of savages much more numerous than themselves, they obliged every man to attend military exercises, and limited the bounds of their plantations that none might be more exposed than was necessary.</P>
<P>IN civil actions, equity, according to the circumstances of the case, seems to have been their rule of determin|ing. The judges had recourse to no other authorities than the reason and understanding which God had given them. In punishing offences they professed to be govern|ed by the judicial law of Moses, but no farther than those laws were of a moral nature.</P>
<P>WHILST they were thus without a code or body of laws, and the colony but just come to it's birth, their sen|tences seem to be adapted to the circumstances of a large family of children and servants, as will appear from the following, which, from amongst many others of the same sort, I have taken out of the public records.</P>

The mini|ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and some of the principal laymen, were consulted with, about a body of laws suited to the circumstances of the colony civil and religious. Committees, consisting of magistrates and elders, were appointed almost every year, for 12 or 14 years together, and whilst they were thus fitting a code, particular laws, which were of greatest necessity, from time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were enacted; and in the year 1648 the whole collected together were ratified by the court and then first printed.</P>
<P>MR. Bellingham of the magistrates, and Mr. Cotton of the clergy, had the greatest share in this work.</P>
<P>LET us consider the character of our new planters, the state and conditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they were in before they left Eng|land, and after their arrival in America, and we shall see the sourc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the peculiarities in their laws and customs.

They professed a sacred regard to the word of God in the old and new testament as a sufficient rule of conduct, and that they were obliged to follow it. They looked upon the observation of the first as well as second table necessary to be enjoined; and as the constitution of their churches would not admit of ecclesiastical courts, provision must be made for the punishment of many offences here by the

civil magistrate which are not offences by the common law. Whether every breach of the laws of the first as well as second table has not such a tendency, by meer ex|ample, to disturb the peace of civil society, as that provi|sion for the punishment thereof is necessary, by some autho|rity or other, I need not determine: They thought it had, and upon this principle they did not chuse such punish|ments for crimes as were meerly in proportion to their affecting the safety or peace of society, a principle upon which the nations of Europe have been more and more modeling their criminal laws for several ages past, but annexed greater penalties to some immoralities and im|pieties than had been known in the country they left, determined many others to deserve the notice of the civil magistrate which would have escaped it in England, and perhaps judged some actions criminal which to minds less scrupulous would have appeared indifferent.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The character which the colony acquired by the strictness and severity of their laws, induced many persons of pious minds to come over themselves, and others to send their children for edu|cation, many of whom remained here.

The country being new and uncultivated, the utmost industry, oeconomy and frugality were necessary to their subsistence, and laws, with heavy penalties to enforce the observance of them. They were in the midst of savages whose numbers were much greater than their own, and were under con|tinual alarms and apprehensions of danger, and a strict dis|cipline

<P>IN that branch of law more especially which is dis|tinguished by the name of crown law, they professed to have no regard to the rules of the common law of England.

After they had lived together three or four years, a prosecution was began against both of them, for adultery in the life time of the first husband. They were both committed to prison and separately brought upon trial for their lives. The court and jury were favorable to the husband and acquitted him of a capital offence, probably because he was not at the time charged a married man The wife likewise met with a favora|ble jury, and they found her also not guilty, but the court, who thought otherwise, refused the verdict, and the cause was carried before the general court, where she very narrowly escaped, the whole court determining that there was proof of a crime which ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ched very near to adultery, but in favor of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe she was discharged.</NOTE> Male adultery with an unmarried woman, was not capital.</P>
<P>HE who was convicted of wilful perjury, with intent to take away the life of another, was to suffer death, from Deut. xix.16.

Many offences are made so, which seem to be in|ferior in their guilt and consequences to the public. The difficulty of conviction may be one reason, and the dis|couragement, it would sometimes be, to witnesses to give their testimonies another and stronger reason in vindica|tion of the common law.

<P>THEIR laws concerning marriage and divorce were somewhat singular. I suppose there had been no instance of a marriage, lawfully celebrated, by a layman in England&punc; when they left it. I believe there was no instance of marriage by a clergyman after they arrived, during their charter, but it was always done by a magistrate, or by per|sons specially appointed for that purpose, who were con|fined to particular towns or districts. If a minister hap|pened to be present, he was desired to pray. It is difficult to assign a reason for so sudden a change, especially as there was no established form of the marriage covenant, and it must have been administred many times in the new plan|tations by persons not the most proper for that purpose, considering of what importance it is to society that a sense of this ordinance, in some degree sacred, should be main|tained and preserved.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Scotch writers tell us, that by their laws it is not necessary marriages should be celebrated by a clergyman, that the consent of parties, signified before a magistrate, or only before two wit|nesses, and without consummation, will make a marriage valid.</NOTE> At this day, marriages are solem|nized by the clergy, and altho' the law admits of its being done by a justice of peace, yet not one in many hundred is performed by them.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The publication of the banns was very early required, and no magistrate, or other person specially authorized to join persons in marriage, had authority to do it before the parties had been pub|lished according to law. The same law was renewed under the province charter, and after more than an hundred years expe|rience, has been found very beneficial; there have been instances, but they are rare, of young people going to New-Hampshire, where licences to marry are granted by the governor. As these instances have been, many of them, not for the most reputable causes, their example has had but little influence. Perhaps, in a few years, the people of England will be equally well satisfied with the provision made by the late marriage act, and no body will be at the pains of a journey to Scotland to avoid conformity to it. Upon Mr. Dudley's being appointed president of the colony, &amp;c. in 1686, he published an order of council, authori|zing and impowering ministers and justices of the peace, the order says, "to consummate marriages," after three several times pub|lication or licence from the president or deputy.</NOTE></P>

Consan|guinity they settled in the same degrees as it is settled in England and in the Levitical laws. It is said, a man may give his wife moderate correction without exposing him|self to any penalty in the law; our legislators had more tender sentiments of this happy state, and a man who struck his wife was liable to a fine of ten pounds or corpo|ral punishment: A woman who struck her husband was liable to the same penalties.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This seems to leave the wife to the mercy of the husband, who ordinarily must have paid the sine himself, or suffer her to be whipped.</NOTE></P>

They had no law for the distribu|tion of the estates of persons dying insolvent; however as executors and administrators were not held to prefer in payment one debt to another, whether by judgment, bond or simple contract; the usual way was, for a creditor of an insolvent person to apply to the general court to appoint commissioners to examine the claims, and also to discover the estate by examining upon oath, &amp;c. and each creditor

It seems very natural to suppose that estates in fee tail would descend in like manner, except so far as the entail limited or cut the fee, as in gavelkind all the sons take as heir of the body. Notwithstanding this, the construction of a general tail was such, that the heir at common law took as heir of the body, to the exclusion of the other children. Traitors and Felons might dispose of their estates, real and personal, by will, after sentence, and if they died intestate, distribution was made as in other cases, there being no forfeitures. They held their lands as of the manor of East Greenwich in the county of Kent, in free and common socage, and not in capite nor by knights service. They strangely supposed that socage tenure included all the properties and customs of gavel|kind, one of which is, "the father to the bough, the son to the plough.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>As to what is objected against persons condemned making will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp;c. we conceive it to be according to our patent and its ori|ginal, viz. that of East Greenwich, according unto which, as we conceive, notwithstanding the father's crime, yet the child|ren are to possess the estate.</Q></P>

After the year 1645, im|posts and excises were introduced. Where the officers are annually elected by the people, one great objection against such duties, viz. the influence such officers may have upon the peoples liberty, in other elections, can have no place.</P>
<P>THEIR military laws at first were more severe, every person being required to appear in arms in order for mili|tary exercise once every month. Some few persons in public office were only excepted. This was afterwards lessened to eight times in a year, and at length to four. Every inhabitant was to be furnished with arms and am|munition. A few months actual service against the Indian enemy in Philip's war, made better soldiers than all their exercise at home had done in forty years.</P>
<P>UPON the division of the colony into regiments, colo|nels and lieut. colonels were appointed to each regiment. This lasted but a short time; ever after they had one field officer only to every regiment, a serjeant major, and a major general for the whole. He was chosen by the free|men. The officers of the several companies, ordinarily, were chosen by the companies respectively, and presented to the general court for their approbation.</P>
<P>IT may not be amiss to add a brief account of their legislative and judiciary forms, and some special customs.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="009705_0229_0F7A462195F9C350">THE magistrates or assistants, and the deputies or re|presentatives of the people, at first, sat together in one room, and, for several years voted together, without any distinction, the major part of the whole number determin|ing the vote, for in 1635, when the general court was ordered, for time to come, to be held twice a year only, it was at the same time resolved, that inasmuch as in those courts held by the magistrates and deputies, there might a|rise some difference of judgment in doubtful cases, there|fore no law, order or sentence should pass as an act of the court, without the consent of the greater part of the ma|gistrates on the one part, and the greater number of the deputies on the other part, and for want of such accord, the cause or order was to be suspended, and if either party thought it sufficiently material, a committee was to be chosen, one half by the magistrates and one half by the deputies, which committee might chuse an umpire, and by them the cause was to be determined. This was a pru|dent precaution on the part of the magistrates, for their number being limited, and the number of deputies increas|ing in proportion as new towns were planted, without such provision, the magistrates would, in a few years, have lost all their weight in the legislative part of the government. There is no record of the general court's sitting and act|ing in distinct and separate houses until the year 1644. In the charter, as has been observed, there was no mention of a house of representatives; a general court was to con|sist of the magistrates and freemen, and this occasioned the dispute whether there was a negative voice in each part of the legislative body, but at length it was agreed, that, in matters of legislation, they should act distinct and separate, and that no legislative act should be valid that was not approved by the major part of each house.</P>
<P>THE judicial power, both in civil and criminal matters, was at first exercised by the court of assistants, except in cases cognizable by a justice of peace. In divers cases of violent death, juries of inquest were impannelled by the governor, and a jury was also impannelled for trial of any persons charged by the jury of inquest. I find but one
<PB N="450" REF="009705_0230_0F7A4622AA352918">
instance of trial by jury in any case, except murder, and that was in an action of assault and battery, until Novem|ber 1633, when it was ordered that process should be directed by the secretary to the beadle, to warn 24 jurors, 14 days before the court, who were to be named by the secretary. In 1624, an order or law was made, that no trial should pass upon any for life or death, without a jury regularly chosen by the freemen. Grand juries were first established by law in September 1635. At the first court afterwards, an hundred offences were presented.</P>
<P>THE colony increasing, and the settlements extending remote from the capital, it was soon found necessary to make a division into shires or counties, and courts were held in each county, in some four in a year, in others two, in Yorkshire or the province of Main, but one. These courts were held by the magistrates who lived in each county, or any other magistrates who would attend, toge|ther with such other persons as the freemen of the county, from time to time, should nominate and the general court approve of, so as to make five in all, any three to hold a court. They had power to determine all civil causes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At first in civil causes they were limited to ten pounds.</NOTE> and all criminal, the penalty not extending to life, member, or banishment. Grand and petit juries were summoned to at|tend them. Appeals from them lay to the court of assistants and from thence to the general court. The higher offences against law were cognizable by the assistants only, except upon application, by appeal or petition, to the general court. In all actions, civil or criminal, in which any stranger was a party or interested, who could not stay, without damage, to attend the ordinary courts of justice, the governor or deputy governor, with any two magistrates, had power to call a special court to hear and determine the cause, either civil or criminal, if triable in a county court; the record of the proceedings to be transmitted to the records of the courts of assistants. In divers towns, a petty court was established for small debts and trespasses under twenty shillings: And in every town the selectmen, who were annually chosen by the town, had power to hear and
<PB N="451" REF="009705_0230_0F7A4622AA352918">
determine all offences against the by-laws of the town, the penalty of which could not extend beyond twenty shillings, and the by-laws could not extend to matters criminal in their nature, but were limited to the regulation of their buildings, fences, streets, &amp;c. to the preventing nusances, and to other matters tending to the convenience and ac|commodation of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE star chamber, high-commission, as well as all the ecclesiastical courts, were in their zenith when our ancestors left England, but they brought away no affection for them. A discontented attorney, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was one Thomas Lechford, who left England about the year 1637, being dissatisfied, as he says, with the ecclesiastical govern|ment, and having made himself obnoxious by his opposition to episcopacy. When he came to New-England, he says, he found every church-member a bishop, and not inclining to become one himself, he could not be admitted a freeman among them, but was very active in censuring their proceedings in civil and eocle|siastical matters. The court took the advantage of an offence of another nature, his going to the jury and pleading with them out of court, and debarred him from pleading any man's cause besides his own, and at the same time admonished him not to pre|sume to meddle beyond what he should be called to by the court. Being deprived of the means of supporting himself, he returned to England in 1641, a zealous episcopalian. Episcopacy being declining there, he had room to indulge the ruling passion, by at|tacking Old-England and New in the same piece, to which he gave the title of Plain Dealing.</NOTE> who published, in 1642, a little pamphlet relative to New-England, says, that
<Q>in their general courts and quarter sessions, they exercised all the powers of parliament, King's bench, com|mon pleas, chancery, high commission, star chamber, and all other the courts of England, and in divers instances put to death, banished, fined, cut off ears, whipt and imprisoned for ecclesiastical and civil offences.</Q>
It will appear from their ecclesiastical constitution, and the professed indepen|dency of the churches, that there was no room for the exercise of great part of the powers of the spiritual courts.</P>
<P>ALL causes which in England would have fallen within the jurisdiction of the high court of admir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lty, were like|wise heard and determined in the courts of common law. There were divers instances of trials, condemnations and
<PB N="452" REF="009705_0231_0F7A462317A1BA78">
executions for piracies, murders and other felonies com|mitted upon the high seas. I imagine, the necessity of the thing, that justice might be done, must have been the plea for this extraordinary proceeding. To have sent such of|fenders to England where they might have had a trial, to the legality of which no exception could have been made, would have been much more regular, and the expence at|tending it must have been matter of little weight, when compared with the putting men to death where the autho|rity for it was but doubtful, if even that may be said in favor of it.</P>
<P>THEIR judicial proceedings were in as summary a way as could well consist with the preservation of any tolerable degree of method or order. They seem to have not much regarded forms in books of entries. Writs and processes were not in the King's name, and were very concise. I find a writ in 1650 in this form.</P>

<P>THEY did not trouble themselves with pleas in abatement. They made no alteration upon the several changes of govern|ment in England. There is no room to suppose that the omission of his Majesty's name proceeded from disaffection, or that they imagined themselves altogether independent. So far as their dependance was expressed in their charter it could not be disputed. The reasonable and necessary connexion between a colony and the state from which it springs, per|haps, was not fully understood. They were not long afraid of any checks or restraints from the powers at home. After a few years, the authority of the King in England was at an end. The house of commons&punc; in 1642, passed

<P>WHERE there was so much of equality in the circum|stances of the inhabitants, and once a year every office ex|pired, it is not strange that every order of men should be fond of acquiring and retaining their full share of power and authority; and, although it had been a known rule in the constitution they came from, that matters of evidence were determinable by the jury, and points of law, ordina|rily, by the court, and the general court was so sensible of the expediency of this rule, that in 1642, they passed a temporary law or order,
<Q>that in all trials between party and party, the jury shall find matter of fact, with da|mages and costs, according to their evidence, and the judges are to declare the sentence upon it, or they may direct the jury to find according to the law,</Q>
yet the jury seldom found a special verdict, which, a contempo|rary writer says, was the cause of many inconveniences.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lechford, p. 28.</NOTE> I do not find that this law was ever revived. It was a very common thing for the court to refuse to receive the verdict of the jury, and, in this case, the cause was carried before the general court. The jury some|times gave their verdict, that there were strong grounds of suspicion, but not sufficient evidence to convict. The court would give sentence upon this verdict, and punish for many offences which, by the evidence upon trial, the party appeared to them to have been guilty of, although he was not convicted of the particular crime he was charged with. <HI>Secundum allegata et probata</HI> was a rule of pro|ceeding to which they did not confine themselves.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hinkley, governor of Plimouth, writing to Mr. Stoughton for advice, in 1681, he answers him.

<P><PB N="254" REF="009705_0232_0F7A462380A0F320">IN criminal prosecutions, regularly, a bill was to be found by a grand jury, in which they were not very formal.

I have met with instances of one of the court standing up, after a verdict of the petty jury of not guilty, in a capital trial, and charging the pri|soner, in open court, with burglary and theft, which were not capital, and a new trial ordered upon such charge. The court would sometimes ask the party charged whe|ther they would be tried by bench or jury.</P>

<P>OATHS were administred with no other ceremony than holding up the hand. This was sufficient to distinguish a witness from the rest of the court.

There is no law to enjoin this or restrain any other mode. Oaths are said to be, generally, admini|stred according to the religion he that swears holds to be true.

<P>THE Massachusets first planters distinguished the natives by four divisions, eastern, western, northern and southern. The eastern people had the ge|neral name of Tarrateens or Tarrenteens; they had their residence at Kennebeck and the other rivers in the pro|vince of Main and country east of it, and were part of the Indians called by the French Abenakis. The several subdivisions of these Tarrenteens or Abenakis, according to the rivers where they dwelt or generally resided, as St. John's, Penobscot, Norridgewock, Ameriscoggin, Saco, &amp;c. were not known to the English until many years after.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Indians of the river Saint Fran&ccedil;ois, viz. the Aresaguntacooks and Weweenocks, were a colony of the Abenakis removed from the eastern parts of New-England for the sake of French neigh|bourhood.

The French traders were better known than the English to these Tarrenteens, and early planted prejudices against the English which could never be eradi|cated. These were the Indians who first used fire arms, which with ammunition they obtained from the French&punc; The second year after the Massachusets planters arrived, the Tarrenteens destroyed some of the English who went to trade with them, and pretended that they were drowned, but the truth being discovered, some of the Indians con|cerned in the murder were taken and hanged.

<PB N="457" REF="009705_0233_0F7A46258BAEAD48">
yet they kept no great correspondence with, nor shewed any affection for, the English colonies, but at all times were attached to the French, who speak of them as the most mild and docile of any of the Indian tribes. The western Indians went by the general name of Mohawks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mohawks they were called by the Indians of New-England, which signifies cannibals, from the Indian word <HI>moho,</HI> to eat.</P>

<P>The southern Indians were divided into many distinct nations or tribes. Those upon Long-Island and the main land opposite upon the sea coast were accounted among the most savage. The Massachusets Indians had but little knowledge of them. There was another sub|division, by the name of the River Indians, who had seated themselves in several commodious places upon the banks of Connecticut river. The next to them were called Mohegins, between Connecticut river and the Pequod river, and upon some of the higher branches of the last mentioned river. Then came the Pequods, seated be|tween and about New-London and Stonington, near to the sea coast. These were supposed to be among the most warlike, active and daring, and made the Naragansets, though more numerous, stand in awe of them, and would have made the English do so likewise if they had been owners of English arms, and understood how to use them. They were represented to have been under greater pre|judices against the English, from the beginning, than any other tribe. Next to the Pequods were the Naragansets, who lived along the sea coast from Stonington round point Judith, and on what is called the Naraganset bay. They consisted of several lesser principalities, but all united

<P>The ancient Indians among the Naragansets reported, when the English first arrived, that they had in former times a sachem cal|led Tashtassuck, incomparably greater than any in the whole land in power and state, that he had only two children, a son and a daughter, and not being able to match them according to their dignity, he joined them together in matrimony, and that they had four sons, of which Canonicus, who was sachem when the English came, was the eldest. <HI>MS</HI> This is the only piece of Indian history or tradition of any sort from the ancestors of our first Indians I have ever met with.</P></NOTE> to whom all the others owed some kind of fealty or subjection. The Nianticks were included and considered as a branch of the Naragansets. The Naragansets must have been very nu|merous. None of the Indians were supposed to increase, but to be continually decreasing, not in the English colonies only, but among the French in Canada also, and yet in 1675 at the beginning of Philip's war it was generally agreed that the Naraganset tribe consisted of 2000 fight|ing men. They were the most curious coiners of the wampompeag,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The people of New-Plimouth, in the year 1627, began a trade with the Dutch at Manhados, and there they had the first knowledge of wampompeag, and their acquaintance therewith occasioned the Indians of these parts to learn to make it. <HI>Hubbard</HI> It is not probable the New-England Indians had any instrument of commerce.

They were considered as a commercial people and not only began a trade with the English for goods for their own consumption, but soon learn'd to supply other distant nations at an advanced price, and to receive bever and other furs in exchange, upon which they made a profit also. The Pequods jeered them for their indisposition to war, and called them a nation of women.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="009705_0234_0F7A4626711A28F0">THE Wamponoags were next to the Naragansets. Their sachem was Massasoiet or Woosamequin, whose chief seat was sometimes at Pokanocket <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bristol.</NOTE> or Sowam, and at other times at Namasket now Middleborough. The Nipnets, who were seated upon some lesser rivers and lakes or large ponds, more within the continent, where Oxford now is and towns near it, were supposed to be tributaries to Massasoiet. The Indians upon Cape Cod, although not considered as part of the Wamponoags, yet were supposed to be also under some kind of subjection to Massasoiet. However, it is certain, that when Philip, the son of Massasoiet, had engaged almost all the other Indians of the country in war with the English, his sollicitations could not prevail with those of Manamet to join him, but they adhered to the English, and were a defence to Sandwich and the towns further upon the cape. There seems to have been two cantons or sachemdoms of the cape Indians, one extend|ing from Eel river in Plimouth, to the south shore of the cape, and comprehended what are now called the Mashpee Indians,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I received this account of the Cape Indians from the Reverend Mr. Hawley, a worthy missionary to the Mashpee tribe, who are the principal body of Indians now remaining in New-England. The town of Mashpee consists of 65 wigwams, besides 9 wigwams at a place called Scanton, and 4 at Sockanosset, in the bounds of Falmouth, who are likewise under Mr. Hawley's charge.

and divers petty Sachems or Sagamores were com|prehended in this division, of which Mashpee was one; the eastern part of the cape from Nobskusset or Yarmouth made another sachemdom, the capital of which was Nausit or Eastham: These were known to the people of New-Plimouth by the name of Nausit Indians. The Indians upon Nantucket, and those upon Martha's Vineyard, are supposed to have been distinct and separate tribes, having their own Sachems and Sagamores. The Nantucket Indians were a large body.</P>
<P>THE several scattered tribes from the Pockanockets to Pis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ataqua river, were called the Northern Indians, and by some Aberginians. There were many distinct settle|ments, upon the lesser channels of Piscataqua or Newi|chewannock river. Merrimack also had it's receptacles, from the mouth fifty miles or more, as Wainooset, Patucket, Amoskeag, Penicook, &amp;c. and Newbury falls was a noted plantation, there being plenty of fish there at all seasons. And for the same reason, and because of the great plenty of shell fish, at Agawam (Ipswich) there was a noted tribe with their Sachem. Naumkeag (Salem and Marblehead) and Saugus (Lynn) made another division. Saugus Indians had a distinct Sachem, known by the English name of George, who lived forty years or more after the English came there.</P>
<P>AT Massachusets, near the mouth of Charles river, there used to be a general rendezvous of Indians. That circle which now makes the harbours of Boston and Charlestown, round by Malden, Chelsea, Nantasket, Hing|ham, Weymouth, Braintree, and Dorchester, was the capital of a great Sachem,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The tradition is that this sachem had his principal seat upon a small hill or rising upland, in the midst of a body of saltmarsh in the township of Dorchester, near to a place called Squantum, and it is known by the name of Massachusets hill, or mount Massa|chusets to this day. The blue hills, so called, in the township of Milton, &amp;c. are called in Capt. Smith's map in 1614, Chevi hills, but they were called before Massachusets mount.

<P>IT is not possible to make a just computation of the number of Indians within the limits of New-England. It is agreed that they looked with a jealous eye upon the English planters, and, when it was too late, repented that they had not, by a general union, discouraged and prevent|ed the first attempts of settlements among them.</P>

<Q>they have a sort of marriage; when a young girl arrived to eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen or fifteen years, she would have suitors in proportion to her charms, who would apply to her father and mother; although, often enough, except among the discreeter sort, the girls would not stay for their con|sent. The enamoured Indian tenders to his mistress a few belts, chains or bracelets of wampom. If the girl likes him she will receive the present, and he comes and lodges with her three or four nights, without saying one word, where they enjoy the fruits of their affections. If, after a week or fortnight spent in this manner, they cannot agree, which is very often the case, she quits her lover, who leaves his wampom and other presents made her. Disappointed, he seeks another mistress, and she another humble servant, and continue so to do until two meet together who are agreeable each to the other. There are some who pass their youth thus with many such husbands, who have not the sole possession, for, assoon as it is night, the young women, although married, run from one wigwam to another and take what they like; but no violence is ever offered to the women, all depending on their consent. The husband takes the like liberty, without raising any jealousy, or but little, between them, nor is it any damage or loss of reputation to them, such being the custom of the country.</Q>

The women not only provided bark and stakes, the materials of their houses or cabins, but were the housewrights who built them, and as often as the family moved, for the sake of fishing or hunting, the women took down the houses and carried them on their backs. They planted, hoed and gathered the corn, and provided barns (holes in the ground cieled with the rind of trees) for the reception of it.

They had nothing to lose, worth even any corporal punishment, much less the life of a subject, where they were not over stocked. Of personal in|juries and affronts every man was his own avenger; they had no religion which forbad rendering evil for evil. Mili|tary authority they had none; every man fought and ran away at his pleasure; for this reason, they never could stand a body of English, and their wars between themselves were extremely precarious: Uncas, with an inferior num|ber of Mohegins, and of no repute, beat Myantinomo at the head of the Naragansets, who held the Mohegins in contempt. Their arms were bows and arrows, their cap|tains, only, carried a spear. Their bowstrings were made of Moose sinews. Their arrows were pointed with a small flat stone, of a triangular form, the basis of which they fastened with a leathern string into a cleft made in the end of a young stick of elder wood; and, simple as they were, they did execution upon naked bodies. Many of these stones, or heads of arrows, are found, to this day, in the earth, in places where the Indians used to resort. After the arrival of the English, they made the heads of their arrows of brass, fastened them to a small stick 6 or 8 inches long, formed to fix into the end of the pithy elder, which they bound round to strengthen it. They seldom missed their mark, when they aimed at a beast or bird, running or flying. In their wars they are said to have always engaged in a loose dis|orderly manner, and assoon as their artillery was spent, to have taken to their heels. The Mohawks secured their bodies against the arrows of other Indians by a covering of seahorse skins. Their principal weapon was the toma|hawk, a club two or three feet long, with a knob at the end; since they knew the use of iron, improved by the addition of a sharp pointed hatchet opposite to the knob. Roger Williams says it was their constant practice to strike off the heads of their dead enemies, at which they were very expert.</P>

<P>THEY that speak most favorably, give but an indifferent idea of the qualities of their minds. Mr. Wilson speaks of them, but with compassion, as the most sordid and contemptible part of the human species. Mr. Hooker says, they are the veriest ruins of mankind upon the face of the earth. Perhaps, the Indians about the Massachu|sets bay were some of the lowest of the American nations. We hear nothing of that formality and order in their counsels, but little of those allegories and figures in their speeches and harangues, which the Frencho bserved among the Iroquois and other nations, at the beginning of their acquaintance with them. Indeed, in their discourses to|gether upon any matter which they deemed important, they seldom used any short colloquiums, but each spake his mind at large without interruption, the rest of the company giving attention, and when he had finished some other gave as large an answer. They shewed courtesy to the English at their first arrival, were hospitable, and made such as could eat their food welcome to it, and readily instructed them in planting and cultivating the Indian corn, and some of the English who lost themselves in the woods, and must otherwise have perished by famine, they relieved and conducted home. Their manner was to come into the English houses without knocking, and to sit down without ceremony. R. Williams compared the Quakers to them. There was no trading with them but for ready pay.

Some appearances there were of compassion, gratitude and friendship, and of grief at the death or distress of their children or near relations. Some degree of these social affections is inseparable from human nature. Vices they had many. They were false, malicious and revengeful. The least injury caused in them a deadly hatred which could never be allayed. They were infinitely cruel to their enemies, cutting and mangling their bodies, and then broiling them alive upon hot embers, and inflicting the most exquisite torments they could invent. They were not known to feed upon the flesh of their enemies after the English came among them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Champlain says the Algonquins took the heart of one of their enemies killed in battle, cut it into pieces and gave it to his bro|ther and several other prisoners to eat, who took it into their mouths but would not swallow it.</P>

The English women had nothing to fear, as to any attempt upon their honor. The same obser|vation is made of the Canada Indians, with respect to the French women. La Hontan, a French author, who has given a different account, is charged with a fondness for em|bellishing his memoirs and being very credulous. They had their choice among their own women. We have but little reason to wonder that so few Englishmen incline to cohabit with Indian women.</P>
<P>THEY had some sports and games with which they some|times diverted themselves. Football was the chief, and whole cantons would engage one against another. Their goals were upon the hard sands, as even and firm as a board, and a mile or more in length, their ball not much larger than a hand ball, which they would mount in the air with their naked feet, and sometimes would be two days together before either side got a goal. They had two principal games of chance, one they called puim, this was much the same with a game Charlevoix mentions among the Miamis, which he calls jeu des pailles, or the game of straws. They took a number of packets of small sticks or straws, unequal in number but near of a size, and shuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling them together, he, to whose lot the highest number fell, was the forwardest in the game. Another game they called hub|bub, the same the French called jeu de plat, the game of the dish among the Hurons. They took five small pieces of bone, flatter than a die and longer, black on the one side and white on the other, these they put into a small wooden tray or platter, and giving it a stroke on the ground the bones all flew into the air, and the gamesters whisk their hands to and fro among the bones, and then smite them|selves on the breast and thighs, crying out, hub, hub, hub, so as to be heard at a great distance. According as the bones happened to be more or less of one colour, so they won or lost. Whilst any one continued to win he held

the tray, and upon his losing gave it to the next. The Negroes in Guinea have a game of the same sort, which the call paw-paw. Shooting at marks was a diversion for their children, assoon as they were capable of drawing a bow. Swimming, running and wrestling they were, as early, ac|customed to. Their hunting and fishing, being all they did, which could be called labor, for their maintenance or support, served also as diversions. Deer, Moose and Bears were their chief objects, Wolves, Wild Cats, Raccoons, Otters, Musquashes, and even Bevers, were not much re|garded, until the English, from the value they set upon their skins or furs, encouraged the pursuit of them. Be|sides their bows, they had other devices to take their game, sometimes by double hedges a mile or two in length, and a mile wide at one end, and made narrow, by degrees, un|til they came to a gap of about six feet, against which they lay hid to shoot the Deer, as they came through in the day time, and, at night, they set Deer traps, being springs made of young trees. They had their traps also for Bevers and Otters. Their ordinary fishing was with hooks and lines. They made their hooks of bones, their lines of wild hemp, stronger and neater than the English lines.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Douglass says they had no threads of flax, hemp or any other herbs, but the earliest accounts of the Massachuset Indians assert the contrary, and Champlain says that it was part of the em|ployment of the Indian women of Canada to twist the wild hemp and make it into nets for fishing.</NOTE> They had a way of taking Sturgeon by lighting a torch made of birch bark, which weaving to and fro by the side of their canoo would delight the Sturgeon and cause them to come tumbling and playing, throwing up their white bellies into which the Indians struck their spears or darts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The natives of the Canary islands happened to hit upon the same way of taking fish.</NOTE> The Sturgeons backs were impenetrable.

Idolatry <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Amongst Mr. Eliot's manuscripts I find the following story. "This spring time in the year 1653, being sundry days at Pau|tucket, and spending a sabbath among them, there was a woman at the meeting who had a small bright brass image of a man a|bout her neck, hanging by a string fastened about the neck of the image, I observed it but thought little of it; afterwards when I thought to have gone away, my horse had run and gone home|ward, as they found by his footing, whereupon I sent some after my horse and purposed to have gone on foot after till they met me with my horse. Many being gathered together to take leave of me, among the rest there was that woman with an image about her neck; I asked her why she wore it there, she roundly and readily answered me, I pray unto it. Why, says I, do you account that to be your God? She as readily answered me yes. At which I marvelled, having never seen the like before at any place I ever came to. I therefore declared to her and to the company about us the greatness of the sin of idolatry. I urged the second com|mandment. I shewed how much idols should be demolished. I desired her to give it to me that I might demolish it, but she re|fused. I offered her half a crown for it, but she was not willing. Perceiving it was tied with a riding knot, I slipped the knot and slipped off the image; then she swelled with anger and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ied. I presently gave her half a crown, which she took but was not pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|fied. I told the company, the first pond I came to I would cast it in. When I departed, the woman girt up her loins and ran after me; when I perceived it, I asked her whither she went, she an|swered whither I went, and she would not leave me so long as I had her God about me. It began to rain, which was some dis|couragement to my going forward; then I considered that this act of mine, in taking away and abolishing the idol, was neither so proper nor so valid as it would be if the rulers and sachems should do it&mdash;I resolved to return, and did so and the woman after me. When I came to the wigwam, there being four sachems present which prayed to God, I desired them all to come together. Being come, I told them that seeing the rain had driven me back, God would not have me yet to go, but somewhat else is to be done about this idol and the sin of idolatry, and because the woman is not content with what I have done I do commit the matter and the idol unto you to judge. So I laid it upon the ground before them where they sat, and went to confer with the company. When they had sat about half an hour in consultation, they de|sired the company to come before them, which they did. They said they had agreed upon their judgments. 1st, That the act in taking away the idol was well done. 2dly, That one man should be appointed to demolish the idol, and three others for witnesses that it was done. 3dly, They adjudged the idolatress to be a great sinner, yet as it was the first time, and she had done it ignorantly, therefore they would spare her, yet they did all one after another reprove her very solemnly. After execution was done upon the idol, one declared that he understood there were some more idols like to that, in other houses. I requested the sachems to send for those also. The officer or constable went well guarded, and pre|sently brought a bright brass image or seraphim with his wings spread, to the sachems, who presently passed the same judgment they had done upon the former, and it was executed accordingly.&mdash;I asked, how it should come to pass that there should be such idolatry here and in no place else that I had heard of. They rendered this reason. That being the most northerly place that I resort to, some of those Indians have commerce with the Indians that are yet more northerly, who have commerce with those whom the French teach to pray to such idols, therefore they think the idols and idolatry come from them.</P>
<P>The Oqui of the Algonquins, or French Indians, was the same with the powow of the English Indians. Champlain says, that what caused it to be supposed they intended the Devil, was that when they saw a man do any thing extraordinary, or have any extra|ordinary qualities, as a brave warrior, or a furious fellow to the degree of madness, they called him Oqui. That some of these Oqui's undertook to heal the sick, cure the wounded, and to fore|tell future events.

Passaconaway, a great sagamore upon Mer|rimack river, was the most celebrated powow in the country. He made the Indians believe strange things; that he could make water burn, rocks move and trees dance, and metamorphize himself into a flaming man; that in winter he could raise a green leaf out of the ashes of a dry one, and produce a living snake from the skin of a dead one.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>They had a tradition that a crow brought the first grain of Indian corn, and although this bird often robbed their fields, not one Indian in an hundred would kill them.</P>

<P>THE Indians of Canada, according to Charlevoix, had an infinite number of genii, or subaltern spirits, good and bad, who had their particular worship.

A deep enquiry into futurity could not consist with that indolent state of mind, which they made the summit of all happiness. An Indian convert discoursing with Woosama|quin, the great Sachem, he enquired of the convert, what worldly good things he had gained by his new religion; and not receiving a satisfactory answer, gave himself no further thought about it.

<P>MANY people pleased themselves with a conjecture, that the Indians in America were the descendants of the ten tribes of Israel. There was as little affinity between the Indian and the Hebrew language, as between the languages of any two nations upon the earth, and the New-England Indians had no one custom peculiar to the Israelites, except that of the separation of the women on certain occasions. This custom obtained among most of the nations upon the continent. The French speak of others, viz. that, at cer|tain repasts, they never make use of knives; it is not pro|bable they ever had any to use, on any occasion, until they were brought to them from Europe, they called the first English, Knifemen; that they never break the bones of the beasts they eat, and that, in some of their songs, you may distinguish the word Hallelujah. One Capt. Crom|well, a rich bucanier, who died at Boston about 1646, assured governor Dudley, that he had seen Indians to the southward circumcised. This increased the faith of many.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Their greasing their hair is called, by R. Williams, anointing their heads.</P>

<P>THE language of the Indians, from Piscataqua to Con|necticut, was so nearly the same, that they could tolerably well converse together. It was observed, that without the greatest difficulty, they could not be brought to pronounce the letters L or R. For Lobster, they said Nobstan. The Tarrenteens sounded the R easily.

<P>AT the beginning, our planters promised themselves great things from the soil, and imagined they were rich, having the property of so great an extent of territory. The general court allowed no more than 200 acres of land, in the first dividend, for 50 pounds sterling advanced for the plantation.

Several accounts of the opinions, which at first prevailed, both of the soil and climate, have been preserved. Wood, a writer of a fertile imagination, who lived in the country four years, which, from some passages in his history, appear to have been before the year 1636, or the Pequod war, says

kind of earth, there being little cold spewing land, no moorish fenns, no quagmires, the lowest grounds be the marshes, over which, every full and change, the sea flows; these marshes be rich ground and bring plenty of hay, of which the cattle feed, and like as if they were fed with the best up-land hay in New-England,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account is much too favorable.

The natural upland grass of the country commonly called Indian grass, is poor fodder, perhaps not better, if so good as barley straw.</NOTE> of which likewise there is great store, which grows commonly be|tween the marshes and the woods. This meadow ground lies higher than the marshes, whereby it is freed from the overflowing of the seas, and besides this, in many places where the trees grow thin, there is good fodder to be got amongst the woods. There be likewise in divers places near the plantations great broad meadows, wherein grow neither shrub nor tree, lying low, in which places grows as much grass as may be thrown out with a seyth, thick and long, as high as a man's middle, some as high as the shoulders, so that a good mower may cut three load in a day. Many object this is but coarse fod|der. True it is, that it is not so fine to the eye as English grass, but, being made into hay, the cattle eat it as well as lea hay, and like as well with it. The worst that can be said against the meadow grounds is, that there is but little edish or after pasture, which may pro|ceed from the late mowing, more than any thing else.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I conclude, from this account, that they had then no hay of English grass.

It has been made a question, whether the seed of the white clover is not in the earth in all parts of the country, and our farmers affirm, and there is no doubt of the fact, that if they break up new ground in the woods, where no dung has ever been spread, and lay it down the next or the same year, and give it a thin coat of ashes, the white honey suckle comes in as thick as if the seed had been sown. Some connoisseurs say, that the plant and flower differ from the English honey suckle. Ashes will, certainly, in some of our im|proved lands, bring in this sort of grass, when barn dung, or sea manure, will bring in other sorts of English grass in the same field. On the other hand, in travelling the woods where no cat|tle has been, and where the soil has been so good that the brakes and Indian grass have been four or five feet high, I have searched for English grass without being able to find a spire of any sort. Some have supposed that the Pigeons, which come down to the plantations in infinite numbers, and other birds of passage, scat|ter the seeds in their dung through the continent. There is a tradition, that the grass called fowl meadow grass, which is supe|rior to any other grass of the fresh water meadows, was first brought to the meadows in Dedham, by a large flight of wild fowls, and that from thence the grass and the meadows, where it was first discovered, and from whence it has been communi|cated to many parts of the country, took their names. I do not find the observation any where made that, at the beginning of the English settlements, the European grass came into ground which had been broke up, before any seed was sown. On the other hand, it is not probable that the seeds of all that great variety of grasses, distinct from what is called wild or Indian grass with which our fields abound, was ever imported or sown among us.</NOTE>

Some have learned to make better provision, by burning the grass when it is near ripe, and so suffering a new crop to spring out of the ashes of the old. This they cut down, before it be half ripe, and make it into hay, but this proves like your after meath in Old England, not fit to labour with, yielding a saint nourishment, which brings our cattle so low, and many times to diseases of which they hardly ever recover.</Q></P>

Ordinarily, if the wheat be sown early, it will be so forward, by this time, that the grain will not suffer by it. The spring or summer grain, being later before it is ripe, is, in general, the most exposed. Sir Henry Frankland, several years ago, imported from Lisbon the seed of summer wheat, which ripens there in 12 weeks, and the flour of it is in great esteem.

<HEAD>NUMBER II. Certain Proposals made by Lord Say, Lord Brooke, and other Persons of quality, as conditions of their removing to New-England, with the answers thereto.</HEAD>
<P>DEMAND 1. THAT the common-wealth should consist of two distinct ranks of men, whereof the one should be for them and their heirs&punc; gentlemen of the country, the other for them and their heirs, freeholders.</P>
<P>ANSWER. TWO distinct ranks we willingly acknow|ledge, from the light of nature and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ripture; the one of them called Princes, or Nobles, or Elders (amongst whom gentlemen have their place) the other the people. Here|ditary dignity or honours we willingly allow to the former, unless, by the scandalous and base conversation of any of them, they become degenerate. Hereditary liberty, or estate of freemen, we willingly allow to the other, unless they also, by some unworthy and slavish carriage, do disfranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ize themselves.</P>
<P>DEM. 2. That in these gentlemen and freeholders, assembled together, the chief power of the commonwealth shall be placed, both for making and repealing laws.</P>
<P>ANS. So it is with us.</P>
<P>DEM. 3. That each of these two ranks should, in all public assemblies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave a negative voice, so as without a mutual consent nothing should be established.</P>
<P>ANS. So it is agreed among us.</P>
<P>DEM. 4. That the first rank, consisting of gentlemen, should have power, for them and their heirs, to come to the parliaments or public assemblies, and there to give their free votes personally; the second rank of freeholders should have the same power for them and their heirs of meeting and voting, but by their deputies.</P>
<P><PB N="491" REF="009705_0250_0F7A46334EEC4830">ANS. Thus far this demand is practised among us. The freemen meet and vote by their deputies; the other rank give their votes personally, only with this difference, there be no more of the gentlemen that give their votes personally but such as are chosen to places of office, either governors, deputy governors, councellors, or assistants. All gentlemen in England have not that honour to meet and vote personally in parliament, much less all their heirs. But of this more fully, in answer to the ninth and tenth demand.</P>
<P>DEM. 5. That for facilitating and dispatch of business, and other reasons, the gentlemen and freeholders should sit and hold their meetings in two distinct houses.</P>
<P>ANS. We willingly approve the motion, only as yet it is not so practised among us, but in time, the variety and discrepancy of sundry occurrences will put them upon a necessity of sitting apart.</P>
<P>DEM. 6. That there shall be set times for these meet|ings, annually or half yearly, or as shall be thought fit by common consent, which meetings should have a set time for their continuance, but should be adjourned or broken off at the discretion of both houses.</P>
<P>ANS. Public meetings, in general courts, are by charter appointed to be quarterly, which, in this infancy of the colony, wherein many things frequently occur which need settling, hath been of good use, but when things are more fully settled in due order, it is likely that yearly or half yearly meetings will be sufficient. For the continuance or breaking up of these courts, nothing is done but with the joint consent of both branches.</P>
<P>DEM. 7. That it shall be in the power of this parlia+ment, thus constituted and assembled, to call the gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and all public officers to account, to create new offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs, and to determine them already set up; and, the bett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to stop the way to insolence and ambition, it may be or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that all offices and fees of office shall, every parli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, det<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmine&punc; unless they be new confirmed the last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="009705_0251_0F7A463406B076A0">ANS. This power to call governors and all officers to account, and to create new and determine the old, is settled already in the general court or parliament, only it is not put forth but once in the year, viz. at the great and general court in May, when the governor is chosen.</P>
<P>DEM. 8. That the governor shall ever be chosen out of the rank of gentlemen.</P>
<P>ANS. We never practice otherwise, chusing the gover|nor either out of the assistants, which is our ordinary course, or out of approved known gentlemen, as this year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1636.</NOTE> Mr. Vane.</P>
<P>DEM. 9. That, for the present, the Right Honorable the Lord Viscount Say and Seale, the Lord Brooke, who have already been at great disbursements for the public works in New-England, and such other gentlemen of ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oved sincerity and worth, as they, before their personal remove, shall take into their number, should be admitted, for them and their heirs, gentlemen of the country. But, for the future, none shall be admitted into this rank but by the consent of both houses.</P>
<P>ANS. The great disbursments of these noble person|ages and worthy gentlemen we thankfully acknowledge, because the safety and presence of our brethren at Con|necticut is no small blessing and comfort to us. But, though that charge had never been disbursed, the worth of the honorable persons named is so well known to all, and our need of such supports and guides is so sensible to ourselves, that we do not doubt the country would thankfully ac|cept it, as a singular favor from God and from them, if he should bow their hearts to come into this wilderness and help us. As for accepting them and their heirs into the number of gentlemen of the country, the custom of this country is, and readily would be, to receive and acknow|ledge, not only all such eminent persons as themselves and the gentlemen they speak of, but others of meaner estate, so be it is of some eminency, to be for them and their heirs, gentlemen of the country. Only, thus standeth our case. Though we receive them with honor and allow them
<PB N="493" REF="009705_0251_0F7A463406B076A0">
pre-eminence and accommodations according to their con|dition, yet we do not, ordinarily, call them forth to the power of election, or administration of magistracy, until they be received as members into some of our churches, a privilege, which we doubt not religious gentlemen will willingly desire (as David did in Psal. xxvii.4.) and chris|tian churches will as readily impart to such desirable per|sons. Hereditary honors both nature and scripture doth acknowledge (Eccles. xix.17.) but hereditary authority and power standeth only by the civil laws of some com|monwealths, and yet, even amongst them, the authority and power of the father is no where communicated, together with his honors, unto all his posterity. Where God blesseth any branch of any noble or generous family, with a spirit and gifts fit for government, it would be a taking of God's name in vain to put such a talent under a bushel, and a sin against the honor of magistracy to neg|lect such in our public elections. But if God should not delight to furnish some of their posterity with gifts fit for magistracy, we should expose them rather to reproach and prejudice, and the commonwealth with them, than exalt them to honor, if we should call them forth, when God doth not, to public authority.</P>
<P>DEM. 10. That the rank of freeholders shall be made up of such, as shall have so much personal estate there, as shall be thought fit for men of that condition, and have contributed, some fit proportion, to the public charge of the country, either by their disbursements or labors.</P>
<P>ANS. We must confess our ordinary practice to be otherwise. For, excepting the old planters, i. e. Mr. Hum|phry, who himself was admitted an assistant at London, and all of them freemen, before the churches here were established, none are admitted freemen of this common|wealth but such as are first admitted members of some church or other in this country, and, of such, none are ex|cluded from the liberty of freemen. And out of such only, I mean the more eminent sort of such, it is that our magistrates are chosen. Both which points we should
<PB N="494" REF="009705_0252_0F7A4634CCAF5468">
willingly persuade our people to change, if we could make it appear to them, that such a change might be made according to God; for, to give you a true account of the grounds of our proceedings herein, it seemeth to them, and also to us, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> divine ordinance (and moral) that none should be appointed and chosen by the people of God, magistrates over them, but men fearing God (Ex. xviii.21.) chosen out of their brethren (Deut. xvii.15.) saints (1 Cor. vi.1.) Yea, the apostle maketh it a shame to the church, if it be not able to afford wise men from out of themselves, which shall be able to judge all civil matters between their brethren (ver. 5.) And Solomon maketh it the joy of a commonwealth, when the righteous are in authority, and the calamity thereof, when the wicked bear rule. Prov. xxix 2.</P>
<P>OBJ. If it be said, there may be many carnal men whom God hath invested with sundry eminent gifts of wisdom, courage, justice, fit for government.</P>
<P>ANS. Such may be fit to be consulted with and em|ployed by governors, according to the quality and use of their gifts and parts, but yet are men not fit to be trusted with place of standing power or settled authority. Ahito|phel's wisdom may be fit to be heard (as an oracle of God) but not fit to be trusted with power of settled magistracy, lest he at last call for 12000 men to lead them forth a|gainst David, 2 Sam. xvii.1, 2, 3. The best gifts and parts, under a covenant of works (under which all carnal men and hypocrites be) will at length turn aside by crook|ed ways, to depart from God, and, finally, to fight against God, and are therefore, herein, opposed to good men and upright in heart, Psal. cxxv.4, 5.</P>
<P>OBJ. If it be said again, that then the church estate could not be compatible with any commonwealth under heaven.</P>
<P>ANS. It is one thing for the church, or members of the church, loyally to submit unto any form of govern|ment, when it is above their calling to reform it, another thing to chuse a form of government and governors dis|crepant from the rule. Now, if it be a divine truth, that
<PB N="495" REF="009705_0252_0F7A4634CCAF5468">
none are to be trusted with public permanent authority but godly men, who are fit materials for church fellow|ship, then from the same grounds it will appear, that none are so fit to be trusted with the liberties of the common|wealth as church members. For, the liberties of the free|men of this commonwealth are such, as require men of faithful integrity to God and the state, to preserve the same. Their liberties, among others, are chiefly these. 1. To chuse all magistrates, and to call them to account at their general courts. 2. To chuse such burgesses, every general court, as with the magistrates shall make or repeal all laws. Now, both these liberties are such, as carry along much power with them, either to establish or subvert the commonwealth, and therewith the church, which power, if it be committed to men not according to their godliness, which maketh them fit for church fel|lowship, but according to their wealth, which, as such, makes them no better than worldly men, then, in case worldly men should prove the major part, as soon they might do, they would as readily set over us magistrates like themselves, such as might hate us according to the curse, Levit. xxvi.17. and turn the edge of all authority and laws against the church and the members thereof, the maintenance of whose peace is the chief end which God aimed at in the institution of magistracy. 1 Tim. ii.1.2.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER III. Copy of a Letter from Mr. COTTON to Lord SAY and SEAL in the Year 1636.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT your Lordship writeth of Dr. Twisse his works <HI>de scienti&acirc; medi&acirc;,</HI> and of the sabbath, it did refresh me to reade, that his labors of such arguments were like to come to light; and it would refresh me much more to see them here: though (for my owne particular) till I gett some release from some constant labors here (which the church is desirous to procure) I can get litle, or noe oppertunity to reade any thing, or attend to any thing, but the dayly occurrences which presse in upon me continually, much beyond my strength either of body or minde. Your Lordships advertisement touching the civill state of this colony, as they doe breath forth your singular wisdome, and faithfulness, and tender care of the peace, so wee have noe reason to misinterprite, or undervalue your Lordships eyther directions, or intentions therein. I know noe man under heaven (I speake in Gods feare without flattery) whose counsell I should rather depend upon, for the wise administration of a civill state according to God, than upon your Lordship, and such confidence have I (not in you) but in the Lords presence in Christ with you, that I should never feare to betrust a greater commonwealth than this (as much as in us lyeth) under such a <HI>perpetu&acirc; dictatur&acirc;</HI> as your lordship should prescribe. For I nothing doubt, but that eyther your Lordship would prescribe all things according to the rule, or be willing to examine againe, and againe, all things according to it. I am very ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to believe, what Mr. Perkins hath, in one of his prefatory pages to his golden chaine, that the word, and scriptures
<PB N="497" REF="009705_0253_0F7A463583361138">
of God doe conteyne a short <HI>upoluposis,</HI> or platforme, not onely of theology, but also of other sacred sciences (as he calleth them) attendants, and hand maids thereunto, which he maketh ethicks, eoconomicks, politicks, church-government, prophecy, academy. It is very suitable to Gods all-sufficient wisdome, and to the fulnes and per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ection of Holy Scriptures, not only to prescribe perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for the right ordering of a private mans soule to everlasting blessednes with himselfe, but also for the right ordering of a mans family, yea, of the commonwealth too, so farre as both of them are subordinate to spiritual ends, and yet avoide both the churches usurpation upon civill jurisdictions, <HI>in ordine ad spiritualia,</HI> and the common|wealths invasion upon ecclesiasticall administrations, <HI>in ordine</HI> to civill peace, and conformity to the civill state. Gods institutions (such as the government of church and of commonwealth be) may be close and compact, and co|ordinate one to another, and yet not confounded. God hath so framed the state of church government and ordi|nances, that they may be compatible to any commonwealth, though never so much disordered in his frame. But yet when a commonwealth hath liberty to mould his owne frame <HI>(scripturae plenitudinem adoro)</HI> I conceyve the scripture hath given full direction for the right ordering of the same, and that, in such sort as may best mainteyne the <HI>euexia</HI> of the church. Mr. Hooker doth often quote a saying out of Mr. Cartwright (though I have not read it in him) that noe man fashioneth his house to his hang|ings, but his hangings to his house. It is better that the commonwealth be fashioned to the setting forth of Gods house, which is his church: than to accommodate the church frame to the civill state. Democracy, I do not conceyve that ever God did ordeyne as a fitt government eyther for church or commonwealth. If the people be governors, who shall be governed? As for monarchy, and aristocracy, they are both of them clearely approoved, and directed in scripture, yet so as referreth the soveraign|tie
<PB N="498" REF="009705_0254_0F7A4636428347B0">
to himselfe, and setteth up Theocracy in both, as the best forme of government in the commonwealth, as well as in the church.</P>
<P>The law, which your Lordship instanceth in [that none shall be chosen to magistracy among us, but a church member] was made and enacted before I came into the countrey; but I have hitherto wanted sufficient light to plead against it. 1st. The rule that directeth the choice of supreame governors, is of like aequitie and weight in all magistrates, that one of their brethren (not a stranger) should be set over them. Deut. 17.15. and Jethroes counsell to Moses was approved of God, that the judges, and officers to be set over the people, should be men fearing God. Exod. 18.21. and Solomon maketh it the joy of a commonwealth, when the righteous are in autho|rity, and their mourning when the wicked rule, Prov. 29.21. Job 34.30. Your Lordship's feare, that this will bring in papal excommunicatjon, is iust, and pious: but let your Lordship be pleased againe to consider whether the consequence be necessary. <HI>Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur</HI>: non-membership may be a iust cause of non|admission to the place of magistracy, but yet, ejection out of his membership will not be a iust cause of ejecting him out of his magistracy. A godly woman, being to make choice of an husband, may iustly refuse a man that is eyther cast out of church fellowship, or is not yet receyved into it, but yet, when shee is once given to him, shee may not reject him then, for such defect. Mr. Humfrey was chosen for an assistant (as I heare) before the colony came over hither: and, though he be not as yet ioyned into church fellowship (by reason of the unsetlednes of the con|gregation where he liveth) yet the commonwealth doe still continue his magistracy to him, as knowing he waiteth for oppertunity of enioying church-fellowship shortly.</P>
<P>When your Lordship doubteth, that this corse will draw all things under the determination of the church, <HI>in ordine ad spiritualia</HI> (seeing the church is to determine who
<PB N="499" REF="009705_0254_0F7A4636428347B0">
shall be members, and none but a member may have to doe in the government of a commonwealth) be pleased (I pray you) to conceyve, that magistrates are neyther chosen to office in the church, nor doe governe by directions from the church, but by civill lawes, and those enacted in ge|nerall corts, and executed in corts of iustice, by the gover|nors and assistants. In all which, the church (as the church) hath nothing to doe: onely, it prepareth fitt instruments both to rule, and to choose rulers, which is no ambition in the church, nor dishonor to the commonwealth, the apostle, on the contrary, thought it a great dishonor and reproach to the church of Christ, if it were not able to yield able judges to heare and determine all causes amongst their brethren. i. Cor, 6.i. to 5. which place alone seem|eth to me fully to decide this question: for it plainely holdeth forth this argument: It is a shame to the church to want able judges of civill matters (as v. 5.) and an au|dacious act in any church member voluntarily to go for judg|ment, other where than before the saints (as v. i.) then it will be noe arrogance nor folly in church members, nor preiudice to the commonwealth, if voluntarily they never choose any civill judges but from amongst the saints, such as church members are called to be. But the former is cleare: and how then can the latter be avoyded. If this therefore be (as your Lordship rightly conceyveth one of the maine objections if not the onely one) which hin|dereth this commonwealth from the entertainment of the propositions of those worthy gentlemen, wee intreate them, in the name of the Lord Jesus, to consider, in meeknes of wisdome, it is not any conceite, or will of ours, but the holy counsell and will of the Lord Jesus (whom they seeke to serve as well as wee) that overruleth us in this case: and we trust will overrule them also, that the Lord onely may be exalted amongst all his servants. What pittie and griefe were it, that the observance of the will of Christ should hinder good things from us!</P>
<P>But your Lordship doubteth, that if such a rule were necessary, then the church estate and the best ordered
<PB N="500" REF="009705_0255_0F7A463758973250">
commonwealth in the world were not compatible. But let not your Lordship so conceyve. For, the church submitteth it selfe to all the lawes and ordinances of men, in what commonwealth soever they come to dwell. But it is one thing, to submit unto what they have noe calling to reforme: another thing, voluntarily to ordeyne a forme of govern|ment, which to the best discerning of many of us (for I speake not of myselfe) is expressly contrary to rule. Nor neede your Lordship feare (which yet I speake with sub|mission to your Lordships better judgment) that this corse will lay such a foundation, as nothing but a mere democra|cy can be built upon it. Bodine confesseth, that though it be <HI>stat us popularis,</HI> where a people choose their owne governors; yet the government is not a democracy, if it be administred, not by the people, but by the gover|nors, whether one (for then it is a monarchy, though elective) or by many, for then (as you know) it is aristo|cracy. In which respect it is, that church government is iustly denyed (even by Mr. Robinson) to be democratical, though the people choose their owne officers and rulers.</P>
<P>Nor neede wee feare, that this course will, in time, cast the commonwealth into distractions, and popular confusions. For (under correction) these three things doe not under|mine, but doe mutually and strongly mainteyne one ano|ther (even those three which wee principally aime at) authority in magistrates, liberty in people, purity in the church. Purity, preserved in the church, will preserve well ordered liberty in the people, and both of them establish well-ballanced authority in the magistrates. God is the author of all these three, and neyther is himselfe the God of confusion, nor are his wayes the wayes of con|fusion, but of peace.</P>
<P>What our brethren (magistrates or ministers, or leading freeholders) will answer to the rest of the propositions, I shall better understand before the gentlemans returne from Connecticutt, who brought them over. Mean while, two of the principall of them, the generall cort hath already
<PB N="501" REF="009705_0255_0F7A463758973250">
condescended unto. 1. In establishing a standing councell, who, during their lives, should assist the governor in ma|naging the chiefest affayres of this little state. They have chosen, for the present, onely two (Mr. Winthrope and Mr. Dudley) not willing to choose more, till they see what fur|ther better choyse the Lord will send over to them, that so they may keep an open doore, for such desireable gentle|men as your Lordship mentioneth. 2. They have graunted the governor and assistants a negative voyce, and reserved to the freemen the like liberty also.

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners for foreigne Plantations.</SALUTE>
The humble Petition of the Inhabitants of the Massachu|sets in New-England, of the Generall Court there assembled, the 6th day of September, in the 14th yeare of the Reigne of our Soveraigne Lord King CHARLES.</OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS it hath pleased your Lordships, by order of the 4th of April last, to require our patent to be sent unto you, wee do hereby humbly and sincerely professe, that wee are ready to yield all due obe|dience to our soueraigne Lord the King's majesty, and to your Lordships under him, and in this minde wee left our native countrie, and according thereunto, hath been our practise ever since, so as wee are much grieved, that your Lordships should call in our patent, there being no cause knowne to us, nor any delinquency or fault of ours ex|pressed in the order sent to us for that purpose, our go|vernment being according to his Majestyes grant, and wee not answerable for any defects in other plantations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS is that which his Majesties subjects here doe be|lieve and professe, and thereupon wee are all humble sui|tors to your Lordships, that you will be pleased to take into further consideration our condition, and to affoord us the liberty of subjects, that we may know what is layd to our charge; and have leaive and time to answer for ourselves, before we be condemned as a people unworthy of his Majesties favour or protection; as for the quo warranto mentioned in the said order, wee doe assure your Lord|ships
<PB N="508" REF="009705_0259_0F7A463BC38E56E0">
wee were never called to answer to it, and if wee had, wee doubt not but wee have a sufficient plea to put in.</P>
<P>IT is not unknowne to your Lordships, that we came in|to these remote parts with his Majesties licence and en|couragement, under his great seale of England&punc; and in the confidence wee had of that assurance, wee have trans|ported our families and estates, and here have wee built and planted, to the great enlargement and securing of his Majesties dominions in these parts, so as if our patent should now be taken from us, we shall be looked on as runnigadoes and outlawed, and shall be enforced, either to remoove to some other place, or to returne into our na|tive country againe; either of which will put us to un|supportable extremities, and these evills (among others) will necessarily follow. (1.) Many thousand souls will be exposed to ruine, being layd open to the injuries of all men. (2.) If wee be forced to desert this place, the rest of the plantations (being too weake to subsist alone) will, for the most part, dissolve and goe with us, and then will this whole countrey fall into the hands of the French or D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch, who would speedily imbrace such an oppertunity. (3.) If we should loose all our labour and costs, and be deprived of those liberties which his Majesty hath granted us, and nothing layd to our charge, nor any fayling to be found in us in point of allegiance (which all our country|men doe take notice of and will justify our faithfulness in this behalfe) it will discourage all men heereafter from the like undertakings upon confidence of his Majestyes royal grant. Lastly, if our patent be taken from us (whereby wee suppose wee may clayme interest in his Majestyes favour and protection) the common people heere will conseive that his Majesty hath cast them off, and that, heereby, they are freed from their allegiance and subjection, and, thereupon, will be ready to confederate themselves under a new government, for their necessary safety and subsistance, which will be of dangerous example to other plantations, and perrillous to ourselves of incurring his Majestyes displeasure, which wee would by all means avoyd.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="009705_0259_0F7A463BC38E56E0">UPON these considerations wee are bold to renew our humble supplications to your Lordships, that wee may be suffered to live heere in this wilderness, and that this poore plantation, which hath found more favour from God than many others, may not find lesse favour from your Lord|ships; that our liberties should be restreyned, when others are enlarged, that the doore should be kept shutt unto us, while it stands open to all other plantations, that men of ability should be debarred from us, while they have incou|ragement to other colonies.</P>
<P>WEE dare not question your Lordships proceedings; wee only desire to open our griefes where the remedy is to be expected: If in any thing wee have offended his Majesty and your Lordships, wee humbly prostrate our|selves at the footstool of supreame authority; let us be made the object of his Majestyes clemency, and not cut off, in our first appeal, from all hope of favour. Thus, with our earnest prayers to the King of Kings for long life and prospereety to his sacred Majesty and his royall family, and for all honour and welfare to your Lordships, wee humbly take leave.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER VI. The Theses of the first Class of Graduates at Harvard College, in 1642.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the year 1642 to the year 1764, inclusive, 2124 persons have received degrees at Harvard College, about 40 of which were honorary degrees, the remainder were conferred upon such as had been admitted students there. In July last, 1091 of the persons graduated remained alive, the eldest of whom received his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1698. The salary of the Pre|sident, from the first foundation, has been, annually, granted by the government of the colony and province, besides annual grants which have been made, for many years past, to the several profes|sors and instructors, where the foundations have been insufficient. The charge of the several buildings also, except the first house built principally by the legacy of Mr. Harvard, Stoughton-Hall, by lieutenant governor Stoughton, and the Chapel by Mrs. Hol|den, has always been born by the government. The library, consisting of five or six thousand volumes, many of them by the most celebrated authors, grew out of donations from charitable benefactors, unless any small purchases have been made out of the college stock. This valuable library, together with the apparatus, and the whole of the college, in which they were placed, were consumed by fire, in January 1764. Very generous presents have been since made, towards the library, but, as yet, far short of procuring one, equal to the former. Of the many benefactors to the college, the family of Hollis stands the first upon the list. Mr. Thomas Hollis of London, who died in 1731, founded two professorships, one of divinity and the other of mathematicks and natural philosophy. He gave an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and made great and frequent ad|ditions to the library. Several other branches of the family have given bountifully to the college, particularly the present Mr. Hollis of Grey's Inn, who, besides his donations to the former library, has given largely towards the new library now collecting. The general court, having caused a new college to be built in the year 1763, which cost between four and five thousand pounds sterling, it has taken the name of Hollis-Hall, in grateful remem|brance of the benefactions of this worthy family. I suppose the donation of Thomas Hancock <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late of Boston deceased, who gave one thousand pounds sterling towards founding a pro|fessorship for the oriental languages, is the next in value. His executor and residuary legatee, Mr. John Hancock, being in|formed of his testator's intention to have given five hundred pounds sterling more, towards the library, generously gave the same sum for the same purpose.</NOTE></HEAD>

thinges, about three or four and twenty years since, seeing just cause to feare the persecution of the then bishops and high commission, for not conforming to the ceremonies then pressed upon the consciences of those under their power, we thought it our safest course to get to this out|side of the world, out of their view and beyond their reach. Yet before we resolved upon soe great an under|taking, wherein should be hazarded not only all our estates but alsoe the lives of ourselves and our posterity, both in the voyage at sea (wherewith we were unacquainted) and in coming into a wilderness uninhabited (unless in some few places by heathen barbarous Indians) we thought it necessary to procure a patent from the late King, who then ruled all, to warrant our removall and prevent future in|conveniences, and soe did. By which patent, liberty and power was granted to us to live under the government of a governour, magistrates of our owne chusing, and under laws of our owne making (not being repugnant to the lawes of England) according to which patent we have governed ourselves above this twenty three years, we coming hither at our proper charges, without the help of the state, an acknowledgment of the freedome of our goods from cus|tom, and having expended, first and last, in our transporta|tion, building, fencinge, warre with the Indians, fortifying, subduing the earth in making it fit for culture, divers hun|dereth of thousand poundes; and have now made the place soe habitable that we are enabled to live in a mean and low condition, and alsoe to furnish other places with corne, beife, pork, mastes, clapboord, pipe staves, fish, bea|ver, otter, and other commodities, and hoped that our pos|terity should reape the fruit of our labours, and enjoy the liberties and privileges we had obteined for them, and for which we have payd soe dear and run soe great hazards. And for our carriage and demeanour to the honourable parliament, for these ten years, since the first beginning of your differences with the late King and the warre that after ensuied, we have constantly adheared to you, not withdrawing ourselves in your weakest condition and

doubtfullest times, but by our fasting and prayers for your good successe, and our thanksgiving after the same was attained, in dayes of solemnity set apart for that purpose, as alsoe by our sending over useful men (others alsoe going voluntarily from us to help you) who have been of good use and done good acceptable services to the army, de|claring to the world heerby, that such was the duty and love we beare unto the parliament that we were ready to rise and fall with them; for which we have suffered the hatred and threats of other English colonies, now in rebellion against you, as alsoe the losse of divers of our shippes and goods, taken by the Kings party that is dead, by others commissioned by the King of Scotts, and by the Portugalls. All which if you shall pleas justly and favour|ably to consider, we cannot but hope, but that, as you have formerly conferred many favours upon us, soe it shall goe noe worse with us, than it did under the late King; and that the frame of our government shall not be changed, and enstead of governour and magistrates yearly by our|selves chosen, have other imposed upon us against our wills; wherein if our hopes should deceave us (which God forbid) we shall have cause to say we have fallen into hard times, and sit downe and sigh out our too late repentance for our coming hither, and patiently bear what shall be imposed upon us; our adversity in such a case being the greater, because some of us are too old, and all our estates growne too weake (except a very few) to seek out a new corner of the world to inhabit in. But, as we said before, we hope that this most honourable parliament will not cast such as have adheared to you and depended upon you, as we have done, into soe deep despaire, from the fear of which we humbly desire to be speedily freed by a just and gracious answer; which will freshly bind us to pray and use all lawfull endeavours for the blessing of God upon you and the present government.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the right honorable his Excellence the Lord Generall CROMWELL.</SALUTE>
<SALUTE>Right Hon^b^l^e^.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WEE acknowledge ourselves in all dutie bound, not only to take due notice of that tender care and undeserved respect your excellence hath, upon all occasions, vouchsafed unto the poor despised colonie of the Massa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">husets in New-England, but also to acknowledge ourselves ever obliged to serve you, and to improve that interest which, through grace, we have obtained in Jehovah, the God of armies, to prosper you and your great and godly undertakings to his glorie and your everlasting comfort.</P>
<P>YOUR readines, right honorable, to doe us good, hath occasioned these lines to be presented to your excellence, to the end that no priuat information may occasion your honor (contrarie to your aymes and ends) to preiudice this colonie, by inviting over many of the inhabitants thereof to be transplanted into Ireland; wherein, although we verilie beleeve that your honor aymes at the glorie of God and the welfare of this people, yet (with fauor) we conceave it will tend to the contrarie, for these reasons following.</P>
<P>FIRST, We did professe, we came into these remote partes of the earth to enioy the liberties of the gospel in their puritie, which, hitherto, we have (through the grace of Christ) had, without restraint, these 23 years and above. So that there is no solid ground for any defect therein, that we know, that should occasion a remoue.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="009705_0265_0F7A46400162A510">SECONDLIE, God hath blessed the countrey with plentie of food of all kindes, generallie through the land, inso|much that there are many thousands of bushels of graine, and other provisions, of beef, pork, &amp;c. yearlie transported to other places. And where there be any poore people through age, or weaknes, or losses by fire or other hand of God upon them or their estates, the churches or towns, or both, doe contribute to their wants. So that povertie cannot, truely, be alleaged to be a ground of remouall.</P>
<P>THIRDLIE, We know not a more healthie place in the whole world, for the general, than this land. Therefore, there can be no ground of remouing for want of health.</P>
<P>FOURTHLIE, We know not any countrey more peace|able and free from warre, for the present, through the mercy of God. What our unthankfullness may bring upon us, the just God onlie knowes; but we desire the Lord so to guide us, that we may not provoke the eyes of his jelosie against us. Soe that we conceave there is no just ground of remouall in that respect.</P>
<P>FIFTHLIE, God is pleased hitherunto to maintayne unto us all his ordinances, both in church and common|wealth, whereby, spreading errors in judgement are sup|pressed, and prophanenes and wickednes in practice punish|ed according to rule and the best light God is pleased to vouchsafe unto us. So that we cannot see ground of re|moueall for any defect in these particulars.</P>
<P>SIXTHLIE, God hath made this colonie to be instru|mentall in the conversion of some of the natiues amongst us, and many more are hopefull to submitt to the gosple and beleeve in Christ Jesus. And that worke is brought to this perfection alreadie, that some of the Indians them|selves can pray and prophesie, in a comfortable manner, to the rest, with great gravitie, reverence and zeale, and can write and read English and Indian comfortably. And many s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ores of them ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mble together upon their lecture days, and are well affected to the gosple. So that although this may not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be an argument sufficient to hinder some from removing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it might be a just ground of consider|ation
<PB N="522" REF="009705_0266_0F7A4640C45EC640">
for many to turne their backs upon so hopefull and glorious a worke.</P>
<P>LASTLIE, The great noise and general report of so many invited, and intending to transplant themselves into Ireland, hath occasioned some discouragement and weaken|ing to the whole bodie of the colonie, and necessarilie brings an ill report upon the land, as if defective in that which make for a peoples comfortable subsistance, which cannot be but dishonourable to our good God, who hath done so much for us as he hath done, and consequentlie not comfortable to such amongst us as have occasioned it.</P>
<P>YET, notwithstanding (right honorable) it is not our purpose, in laying down these reasons before your excel|lence, to hinder any families or persons to remoue to any partes of the world where God calleth them. And there is a law, long since established amongst us, that granteth such a libertie. But our intent onlie is to let your excel|lence understand the state and condition of this people, that God may have his due praises, and that your honor may not be wronged (by particular information) of the state of this colonie; that, accordingly, your excellence may act as you shall, for the future, in your wisdome, see meete.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, We humbly petition your excellence to be pleased to shew us what fauor God shall be pleased to direct you unto on our behalfe, to the most honorable parliament, unto whom we have now presented a petition. The copy of it, verbatim, we are bold to send herewith, that, if God so please, we may not be hindered in our comfortable proceedings in the worke of God heere in this wildernes. Wherein, as for other fauors, we shall be bound to pray, that the Captain of the hoast of Israell may be with you and your whole army, in all your great enter|prises, to the glorie of God, the subduing of his and your enemies, and your everlasting peace and comfort in Jesus Christ. In whom we are, Right Honble.</P>

<P>IT hath beene no smal comfort to us poor exiles, in these utmost ends of the earth (who sometimes felt and often feared the frownes of the mighty) to have had the experience of the good hand of God, in raisinge up such, whose endeavours have not beene wantinge to our welfare: amongst whom, we have good cause to give your highness the first place: who by a continued series of fa|vours have obliged us, not only while you moved in a lower orbe, but since the Lord hath called your highness to supreame authority, whereat we rejoice and shal pray for the continuance of your happy government, that under your shadow not only ourselves, but all the churches may find rest and peace. The assurance of your highness's endeavours for that end wee have lately received by Major Sedgwick and Capt. Leveritt, for, notwithstanding the urgent and important occasions wherewith your highness is pressed, yet your goodness hath compelled you to be mindful of us, and to give such royal demonstration of your grace and favour, far beyond what we dared to expect or desire, upon intelligence of our condition presented to your highness by some private friends, whose well mean|inge to us, must excuse their mistake; which hath made us confident, that our attendance to your pleasure, in fur|nishinge the said gentlemen with voluntiers, for your highness's service against the Dutch at the Manhatas, will be acceptable: with whom also, in complyance with our nation, ever since wee heard of the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, wee have debarred ourselves of all commerce; and have beene exer|cised with serious and conscientious thoughts of our duty

Wee have nothing to add, to what was then under consideration, to put us upon that under|taking, in reference to our own interest, which we ought to understand and should attend, equally with our friends not more concerned than our selves; wherein if wee should be mistaken, wee hope wee shall not be loosers with God or good men, by our tenderness in a case of such importance, and suspendinge our actings, till wee see cleare and satisfyinge grounds of our undertakings, so highly tendinge to the violation of our peace, the almost onely blessinge remaining to us, of all our outward comforts; the losse whereof, with the necessary consequents, would add such weight to our other sufferings as might over|whelme us in sorrow, and in that respect, render us of all men most miserable; which wee are assured is so far from your gracious intentions, that wee have no doubt, but the liberty wee have taken, of the waies proposed by your highness, to take that which is in our understandinge, the most consistent with our peace and welfare; will be most acceptable to your highness, and indeed wee cannot but acknowledge it a gracious providence of God, and a high favour and gentleness in your highness towards us, that when the object of your desire was our good, the meanes to attaine that end should no way press us: for, with all readiness, wee haue consented the said gentlemen may raise 500 voluntiers, armed and furnished for your service, within our jurisdiction, which is a large proportion out of our small numbers, especially at this season of the year, wherein the pressinge occasions of harvest doe call for all our hands to attend that service, least the following winter

<P>OUR desires are, in all things possible, to pursue after and keepe fayre and loving corespondence and entercourse with all the colloneys, and with all our countreymen in New-England; and to that purpose we have endeavoured (and shall still endeavour) to answere the desires and re|quests from all parts of the countrey, coming unto us, in all just and equall returnes, to which end the coloney have made seasonable provision to preserve a just and equal en|tercourse between the coloneys and us, by giving justice to any that demand it among us, and by returning such as make escapes from you, or from the other coloneys, being such as fly from the hands of justice, for matters of crime done or committed amongst you, &amp;c. And as concerning these quakers (so caled) which are now among us, we have no law among us whereby to punish any for only declar|ing by words, &amp;c. their mindes and understandings con|cerning the things and ways of God, as to salvation and an eternal condition. And we, moreover, finde, that in those places where these people aforesaid, in this coloney, are most of all suffered to declare themselves freely, and are only oposed by arguments in discourse, there they least of all desire to come, and we are informed that they be|gin to loath this place, for that they are not opposed by the civill authority, but with all patience and meeknes are

suffered to say over their pretended revelations and admo|nitions, nor are they like or able to gain many here to their way; and surely we find that they delight to be per|secuted by civill powers, and when they are soe, they are like to gaine more adherents by the conseyte of their pa|tient sufferings, than by consent to their pernicious sayings. And yet we conceive, that their doctrines tend to very absolute cutting downe and overturning relations and civill government among men, if generally received. But as to the dammage that may in likelyhood accrue to the neigh|bour colloneys by their being here entertained, we con|ceive it will not prove so dangerous (as else it might) in regard of the course taken by you to send them away out of the countrey, as they come among you. But, however, at present, we judge it requisitt (and doe intend) to com|mend the consideration of their extravagant outgoings unto the generall assembly of our coloney in March next, where we hope there will be such order taken, as may, in all honest and contientious manner, prevent the bad effects of their doctrines and endeavours; and soe, in all courtious and loving respects, and with desire of all honest and fayre commerce with you, and the rest of our honoured and beloved countreymen, we rest</P>

This government is priviledged, by all fitting means, (yea if neede be) by force of armes, to defend themselves both by land and sea, against all such person or persons as shall, at any time, attempt or enterprise the destruction, in|vasion, detriment or annoyance of the plantation, or the inhabitants therein, besides other privileges, mentioned in the patent, not here expressed, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. We conceive any imposition prejudiciall to the coun|try, contrary to any just law of ours (not repugnant to the lawes of England) to be an infringement of our right.</P>
<P N="2">2d, Concerning our dutyes of allegiance to our soueraigne lord the King.</P>

<P>We further judge, that the warrant and letter from the King's Majesty for the apprehending of Colonell Whalley and Colonell Goffe, ought to be diligently and faithfully executed by the authority of this court.</P>

I rejoyce to heere, that you are so willing to be at the Lords disposall; indeed, we are not our owne, for wee are bought with a price, with the precious blood of the Lord Jesus: And, therefore, let us comfort our|selves with this, though we should never meete in this world againe, yet I hope, through grace, wee shall meete in heaven, and soe ever be with the Lord, and it will not be in the power of men to part us. My dear, I know you are confident of my affection, yet, give me leave to tell thee, thou art as deare to me as a husband can be to a wife, and, if I knew any thing that I could doe to make you happy, I should doe it, if the Lord would permitt, though to the losse of my life. As for newes, I shall forbeare writeing of any, for I know not much, and you may heare it from better hands. My unkle Burket is

My dear, my aunt and many others are very kinde to mee, soe that, through mercy, I have noe want of food and rayment, though in a meane way. The Lord is pleased to suite my minde to my condition, and to give mee strength, in some measure, to take paines with my children, which I look upon as a great mercy. I know not whether I may ever have another opportunity to send to you this season or noe, which makes me the longer now; for I shall not send but by those I judge to be faithfull, and, I being in the country, I may not heare of every opportunity; and, though it is an unspeakeable comfort to mee to heare of thy wellfare, yet I earnestly beg of thee not to send too often, for feare of the worst, for they are very vigilant here to find out persons. But this is my com|fort, it is not in the power of men to act their owne will. And now, my dear, with 1000 tears, I take my leave of thee, and recommend thee to the great keeper of Israell, who neither slumbers nor sleepes, who, I hope, will keepe thee, and my deare freind with thee, from all your enemies, both spirituall and temporall, and in his owne time return you with safety to your family.

<P>WHEREAS we have received several addresses from our subjects of several colonies in N.

And we having received some addresses from the great men and natives of those countries, in which they complain of breach of faith, and acts of violence and injustice, which they have been forced to undergoe from our subjects, whereby not only our government is traduced, but the re|putation and credit of christian religion brought into pre|judice and reproach, with the gentiles and inhabitants of those countries who know not God, the reduction of whom to the true knowledge and feare of God is the most worthy and glorious end of all those plantations. Upon all which motives, and as an evidence and manifestation of our fatherly affection towards all our subjects in those several colonies of New-England (that is to say, of the

<HEAD>NUMBER XVI. Copy of the Address of the Massachusets Colony to King CHARLES the 2d, in 1664,</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the KINGS most excellent MAJESTIE,
The humble supplication of the General Court of the Massachusett Colony in New-England.
<SALUTE>DREAD SOVERAIGNE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IFF your poor subjects, who have removed themselves into a remote corner of the earth to enjoy peace with God and man, doe, in this day of their trouble, prostrate themselves at your royal feet, and beg your fa|vour, we hope it will be graciously accepted by your Majestie. And that, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> place you sustein on earth doth number you here among the Gods, so you will imitate the God of heaven, in being ready to maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor, and to receive their cries and addresses to that end. And we humbly beseech your Majestie, with patience and clemency, to heare and accept our plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, th&ocirc; of somewhat greater length than would be comely in other or lesser cases. We aree remote and can speake but seldom, and therefore crave leave to speake the more at once. Wee shall not largely repeat, how that the first undertakers for this plantation, having, by considerable summs, purchased the right thereof, granted to the counsel established at Plimouth by King James, your royal grandfather, did after obtain a patent, given and confirmed to themselves, by your royal father, King Charles the first, wherein it is granted to them and their heirs assigns and associates, forever; not only the absolute use and propriety of the tract of land therein mentioned, but also f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll and absolute power of governing all the people of this place, by men chosen from among themselves, and according to such lawes as they shall,
<PB N="538" REF="009705_0274_0F7A464785235A78">
from time to time, see meet to make and establish, being not repugnant to the lawes of England (they paying only the fifth part of the oare of gold and silver that shall here be found, for and in respect of all duties, demands, ex|actions and service whatsoever) as in the said patent is more at large declared. Under the encouragement and security of which royal charter, this people did, at their own charges, transport themselves, their wives and families, over the ocean, purchase the lands of the natives, and plant this colony, with great labour, hazards, cost and difficulties, for a long time wrestling with the wants of a wildernes, and the burdens of a new plantation; having also, now above 30 yeares, enjoyed the aforesaid power and privi|ledge of government within themselves, as their undoubted right in the sight of God and man. And having had, moreover, this further favour from God, and from your Majestie, that wee have received several gracious letters from your royal selfe, full of expressions tending to con|firme us in our enjoyments, viz. in your Majesties letter bearing date the 15th day of February 1660, you are pleased to consider New-England as one of the chiefest of your colonies and plantations abroad, having enjoyed and grown up in a long and orderly establishment; adding this royal promise, Wee shall not come behind any of our royal predecessors in a just encouragement and protection of all our loving subjects there. In your Majesties letter of the 28th of June 1662, sent us by our messengers, besides many other gracious expressions, there is this [Wee will preserve and do hereby confirme the patent and charter heretofore granted unto them by our royal father of blessed memory, and they shall freely enjoy all the privi|ledges and liberties granted unto them in and by the same.] As for such particulars, of a civil and religious nature, which are subjoined in the said letter, wee have applyed ourselves to the utmost to satisfy your Majestie, so far as doth consist with conscience of our duty toward God, and the just liberties and priviledges of our patent. Wee are further bound, with humble thankfulness, to acknowledge
<PB N="539" REF="009705_0274_0F7A464785235A78">
your Majesties gracious expressions in your last letter wee have received, dated April 23. 1664, as (besides other instances thereof) That your Majestie hath not the least intention or thought of violating, or, in the least degree, infringing the charter heretofore granted by your royal father, with great wisdom, and upon full deliberation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT what affliction of heart must it needs be unto us, that our sins have provoked God to permit our adversaries to set themselves against us by their misinformation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, com|plaints and sollicitations (as some of them have made it their worke for many yeares) and thereby to procure a commission under the great seal, wherein 4 persons (one of them our knowne and professed enemy) are impowered to heare, receive, examine and determine all complaints and appeals, in all causes and matters, as well military as crimi|nal and civil, and to proceed in all things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> settling this country, according to their good and sound discretio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, &amp;c. Whereby, instead of being governed by rulers of our owne choosing, (which is the fundamental privilege of our patent) and by lawes of our owne, wee are like to be subjected to the arbitrary power of strangers, proceeding not by any established law, but by their own discretions. And where|as our patent gives a sufficient royal warrant and discharge to all officers and persons for executing the lawes here made and published, as is therein directed, wee shall now not be discharged, and at rest from further molestation, when wee have so executed and observed our lawes, but be liable to complaints and appeales, and to the deter|minations of new judges, whereby our government and administrations will be made void and of none effect. And th&ocirc; wee have yet had but a little taste of the words or actings of these gentlemen, that are come over hither in this capacity of commissioners, yet we have had enough to confirme us in our feares, that their improvement of this power, in pursuance of their commission (should the same proceed) will end in the subversion of our all. We should be glad to hope that your Majesties instructions (which they have not yet been pleased to impart unto us) may
<PB N="540" REF="009705_0275_0F7A46484E49CE70">
put such limitations to their busines here as will take off much of our feare, but according to the present appear|ance of things we thus speake.</P>
<P>IN this case (dread soveraigne) our refuge, under God, is your royal selfe, whom wee humbly addresse ourselves unto, and are the rather emboldned therein, because your Majesties last gracious letter doth encourage us to suggest what, upon the experience we have had and observation we have made, we judge necessary or convenient for the good and benefit of this your plantation, and because we are well perswaded that had your Majestie a full and right information of the state of things here, you would find ap|parent reason to put a stop to these proceedings, which are certainly disservient to your Majesties interest, and to the prosperity and welfare of this place.</P>
<P>IF these things go on (according to the present appear|ance) your subjects here will either be forced to seeke new dwellings, or sinke and faint under burdens that will be to them intollerable. The vigour of all new endeavours in the several callings and occupations (either for merchandize abroad or further subduing this wilderness at home) will be enfeebled, as we perceive it already begins to be, the good of converting the natives obstructed, the inhabitants driven to we know not what extremities, and this hopeful plantation in the issue ruined. But whatever becomes of us, we are sure the adversary cannot countervail the Kings damages. It is indeed a grief to our hearts, to see your Majestie put upon this extraordinary charge and cost about a business, the product whereof can never reimburse the one halfe of what will be expended upon it. Imposed rulers and officers will have occasion to expend more than can be raised here, so as nothing will returne to your Majesties exchequer, but instead thereof, the wonted bene|fit by customes, exported and imported into England from hence, will be diminished by the discouragement and dimi|nution of mens endeavours in their several occupations; or if the aime should be to gratify some particular gentlemen by livings and revenues here, that will also fail, where
<PB N="541" REF="009705_0275_0F7A46484E49CE70">
nothing is to be had, the King himself will be a looser, and so will the case be found to be here, for such is the pover|ty and meannes of the people of this country (by reason of the length and coldnes of the winters, the difficulty of subduing a wildernesse, defect of a staple commodity, the want of money, &amp;c.) that if, with hard labour, men get a subsistence for their families, tis as much as the ge|nerality are able to do, paying but very smal rates towards the publick charges, and yet, if all, the country hath ordi|narily raised by the year for all the charges of the whole government, were put together, and then doubled or tre|bled, it would not be counted, for one of these gentlemen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> considerable accommodation.</P>
<P>IT is true, that the estates men have, in conjunction with hard labour and vigorous endeavors in their seueral places, do bring in a comfortable subsistence for such a mean peo|ple (we dare not diminish our thankfulnes to God that he provides for us in a wilderness as he doth) yet neither will the former stand if the latter be discouraged, nor will both ever answer the ends of those that need or seeke great things. We perceive there have been great expectations of what is to be had here, raised by some mens informa|tions, but those informations will prove fallacious, disap|pointing them that have relyed upon them. And, if the taking of this course should drive the people out of the country (for to a coalition, therein, they will never come) it will be hard to find another people, that will stay long or stand under any considerable burden in it, seeing it is not a country where men can subsist without hard labour and great frugality.</P>
<P>THERE have also been high representations of great divisions and discontents amongst us, and of a necessity of sending commissioners to relieve the aggrieved, &amp;c. where|as, it plainly appeares, that the body of this people are unanimously satisfied in the present government, and ab|horrent from change, and that what is now offered will, instead of relieving, raise up such grievances as are intolerable. Wee suppose there is no government under
<PB N="542" REF="009705_0276_0F7A4649124DEDA8">
heaven, wherein some discontented persons may not be found; and if it be a sufficient accusation against a govern|ment, that there are some such, who will be innocent? Yet&punc; thr&ocirc; the favour of God, there are but few amongst us that are malecontent, and fewer that have cause to be so.</P>
<P>SIR, the allknowing God knows our greatest ambition is to live a poor and quiet life, in a corner of the world, without offence to God or man. Wee came not into this wilderness to seeke great things to ourselves, and if any come after us to seeke them heere, they will be disappointed. Wee keep ourselves within our line, and meddle not with matters abroad; a just dependence upon, and subjection to your Majestie, according to our charter, it is far from our hearts to disacknowledge. Wee so highly prise your favourable aspect (th&ocirc; at this great distance) as wee would gladly do any thing, that is within our power, to purchase the continuance of it. Wee were willing to testify our affection to your Majesties service, by answering the pro|posal of your honourable commissioners, of which wee doubt not but they have already given your Majestie an account. Wee are carefully studious of all due subjection to your Majestie, and that not only for wrath, but for con|science s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke&punc; And should divine providence ever offer an opportunity, wherein wee might, in any righteous way, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o our poor and mean capacity, testify our duti|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> affection to your Majestie, we hope we should most gladly imbrace it. But it is a great unhappines to be re|duced to so hard a case, as to have no other testimony of our subjection and loyalty offered us but this, viz. to destroy our owne being, which nature teacheth us to pre|serve, or to yield up our liberties, which are far dearer to us than our lives, and which, had we had any feares of being deprived of, wee had never wandred from our fa|thers houses into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nds of the earth, nor laid our labours and estates therein; besides engaging in a most ha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ardou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and difficult warre, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> most warlike of the nativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to our great charge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd the losse of some of the lives of our deare friends.

<P>ROYAL SIR, it is in your power to say of your poor people in New-England, they shall not die. If we have found favour in the sight of our King, let our life be given us at our petition (or rather that which is dearer than life, that we have ventured our lives and willingly passed thr&ocirc; many deaths to obtain) and our all at our request. Let our government live, our patent live, our magistrates live, our lawes and liberties live, our religious enjoyments live, so shall we all yet have further cause to say, from our hearts, let the King live for ever. And the blessing of them that were ready to perish shall come upon your Majestie; hav|ing delivered the poor that cried, and such as had none to helpe them. It was an honour to one of your royal an|cestors that he was called the poor mans King. It was Job's excellency, when he sat as King among his people, that he was a father to the poor. They are a poor peo|ple (destitute of outward favour, wealth and power) who now cry unto their Lord the King. May your Majestie please to regard their cause and maintain their right: It will stand, among the marks of lasting honour, to after generations. And wee and ours shall have lasting cause to rejoice, that we have been numbred among</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. GOVERNOUR and GENTREMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received yours of the 7th of November, by the hands of Mr. Ashurst, a very sober and discreet person, and did (by his communicating it to me) peruse the petition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No. XVI.</NOTE> you had directed to his Majesty, and I do confesse to you, I am so much a friend to your colony, that if the same had been communicated to no body but my self, I should haue disswaded the presenting the same to his Majesty, who, I doubt, will not think himself well treated by it, or the singular care he hath expressed of his subjects in those parts sufficiently acknowledged; but since I found by your letter to my lord Chamberlaine and Mr. Boyle, that you expected some effect from your petition, upon conference with them wee all agreed not to hinder the deliuery of it, though I have read to them and Mr. Ashurst, euery word of the instructions the commissioners haue; and they all confessed that his Majesty could not expresse more grace and goodnesse for that his plantation, nor put it more out of their power, in any degree to invade the liberties and privileges granted to you by your charter; and there|fore wee were all equally amazed to find that you demand a revokation of the commission and commissioners, without laying the least matter to their charge of crymes or exor|bitances: What sense the King hath of your addresse to him, you will I presume heare from himselfe, or by his direction; I shall only tell you, that as you had long cause to expect that the King would send commissioners thither, so, that it was absolutely necessary he should do so, to com|pose the differences amongst yourselves, of which he re|ceived complaint, and to do justice to your neighbours,

which they demanded from his royall hands. I know not what you meane by saying, the commissioners have power to exercise government there altogether inconsistent with your charter and privileges, since I am sure their com|mission is to see and prouide for the due and full observa|tion of the charter, and that all the priviledges granted by that charter may be equally enjoyed by all his Majesties subjects there: I know they are expresly inhibited from intermedling with, or instructing the administration of jus|tice, according to the formes obserued there; but if in truth, in any extraordinary case, the proceedings there haue been irregular, and against the rules of justice, as some particular cases, particularly recommended to them by his Majesty, seeme to be, it cannot be presumed that his Majesty hath or will leaue his subjects of New-England without hope of redresse by an appeale to him, which his subjects of all his other kingdomes haue free liberty to make. I can say no more to you but that it is in your owne power to be very happy, and to enjoy all that hath been granted to you; but it will be absolutely necessary that you performe and pay all that reverence and obe|dience which is due from subjects to their King, and which his Majesty will exact from you, and doubts not but to find from the best of that colony, both in quality and in number.

And although your carriage doth, of it|self, most justly deserve our praise and approbation, yet it seems to be set off with the more lustre, by the contrary deportment of the colony of the Massachusets, as if, by their refractoriness, they had designed to recommend and heighten the merit of your compliance with our directions, for the peaceable and good government of our subjects in those parts. You may therefore assure yourselves, that we shall never be unmindful of this your loyal and dutiful behaviour, but shall, upon all occasions, take notice of it to your advantage; promising you our constant protection and royal favour, in all things that may concern your safety peace and welfare.

<HEAD>NUMBER XX. SAMUEL GORTON's defence against the charges upon him in Morton's Memorial.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>NATHANIEL MORTON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Understand you have lately put forth a book of records&mdash;But this I know, that I am unjustly enrolled, be|cause I was never free nor member incorporate, in your body, or any of your territories; therefore, I may not re|frain to make a short return, only as it concerns myself.</P>
<P>AND 1st. Your peremptory judging of one you know not, for I am a stranger to you.&mdash;</P>
<P>MY 2d word concerns your eminency, in assuming au|thority to canonize and put into the number of saints such men, when they are dead, who, in their life time, were persecutors, especially, you having acknowledged them to be such yourself; as also to thrust down under your feet, and make as bruit beasts, having only hope in this present life, such as are known to be fearers of God, worshipping him instantly, day and night; tho' they be not acknow|ledged to be such, by some particular sectaries as yourself.</P>
<P>A 3d word I have to say concerns your record: Mistake me not, I meddle not with your records further than they concern myself. I then affirm, that your record is fetched from him who is a lyar from the beginning&mdash;In that you declare I have spoken words (or to that effect) that there is no state nor condition of mankind after this life. I do verily believe, that there is not a man, woman or child, upon the face of the earth, that will come forth and say, that ever they heard any such words come from my mouth; and I appeal to God, the judge of all secrets, that there was never such a tho't entertain'd in my heart.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="550" REF="009705_0280_0F7A464CC53D33A8">AND whereas you say, I am become a sordid man in my life; I dare be so bold as to lay my conversation among men to the rules of humanity, with any minister among you, in all the passages of my life which God hath bro't me thro', from my youth unto this day, that it hath been as comely and innocent as his. Whose ox or whose ass have I taken, or when or where have I lived upon other mens labours, and not wrought with my own hands, for things honest in the sight of men, to eat my own bread?</P>
<P>A 4th word I have to say to your pamphlet, concerns the stuff, as you sottishly and contemptuously call it. You may be ashamed to put pen to paper, to publish any thing to the world in shew of religion, not acknowledging the letter of the scripture, but deriding it rather.&mdash;</P>
<P>FOR the rest of those expressions which you charge up|on us, you falsly apply them. We never called sermons of salvation, tales; nor any ordinances of the Lord an abomi|nation or vanity; nor holy ministers, necromancers: We honour, reverence and practice these things. And, how|ever you term me a belcher out of errors, I would have you know, that I hold any call to preach the gospel of Christ, not inferiour to any minister in this countrey, tho' I was not bred up in the schools of humane learning, and I bless God that I never was; least I had been drowned in pride and ignorance, thro' Aristotle's principles, and other heathen philosophers, as millions are, and have been, who ground their preaching of the gospel upon humane prin|ciples, to the falsifying of the word of God, in the ruin of mens souls. Yet this I doubt not of, but that there hath been as much true use made of the languages, within this 20 years past, in the place where I live, as hath been in any church in New-England: I know the manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our preaching very well.</P>
<P>WHEN I was last in England, thro' importunity, I was perswaded to speak the word of God publickly, in divers as eminent places as any were then in London, as also about London, and places more remote; many times the ministers
<PB N="551" REF="009705_0280_0F7A464CC53D33A8">
of the place being hearers, and sometimes many together, at appointed lectures in the countrey. I have spoken in the audience of all sorts of people and personages, under the title of a bishop or a King; and was invited to speak in the presence of such as had the title of excellency; and was lovingly embraced wherever I came, in the word ut|tered, with the most eminent christians in the place; and for leave-taking at our departure, not unlike the ancient custom of the saints, on record in the holy scripture; and I dare say, as evident testimony of God's power, going forth with his word spoken, manifested, as ever any in New-England had; publickly, and immediately after the word delivered, the people giving thanks to God that ever such a word came to be uttered among them; with intreaty for stay and further manifestation, in as eminent places as are in England; where myself did know that doctors of note had formerly preached, and, at that time, such as had more honour put upon them than, ordinarily, preachers have, who gave me the call thither, in way of loving and christian fellowship, the like abounding in the hearers: Therefore, I know not with what New-England is lea|vened or spirited. Indeed, once in London, 3 or 4 malig|nant persons caused me to be summoned before a committee of parliament, because I was not a university man: I ap|peared, and my accusers also; one of them a schoolmaster in Christ's hospital, another or two, elders of independent or separated churches; who were questioned what they had against me. They said I had preached. Divers of the committee answered, that was true, they had heard me. The chairman asked of my accusers, what I had said. They could not repeat any thing, but said they were sure I had made the people of God sad. But the sum of all their accusation was bro't out in a book, which, they said, con|tained divers blasphemies: The book was only that which was printed of the proceedings of the Massachusets against myself and others. The honoured committee took the book, and divers of them looked upon it, and found no such thing there, as they ignorantly suggested: And, tho' my
<PB N="552" REF="009705_0281_0F7A464D832FF6B8">
adversaries could say nothing, but only vent their spleen, crying out upon blasphemy; yet the chairman and divers of the board, knights and other gentlemen, questioned me about my call to preach, and other principal points of re|ligion, and I answered to all of them according to my knowledge and conscience. Then my accusers desired Mr. Winslow might be called forth, whom they had pro|cured to appear there, whom they thought would oppose me strongly, with respect to that book: When he came out of the crowd (for there was a multitude of people, the place being spacious) he spake judiciously and manlike, de|siring to be excused, for he had nothing to say to me in that place, his business with me lay before another commit|tee of parliament; which gave the table good satisfaction. My answers and arguments were honourably taken by the chairman and the rest of the committee, and myself dis|missed as a preacher of the gospel. Shortly after, emi|nent preachers, living remote from London, then present, sent unto me kind gratulations, for my arguments used, and answers given before that committee. Which act of that committee I take to be as good an human call to preach, as any of your ministers have; and other call I know none they have. And, for a human call, I think mine to be as good as the degrees in the schools, or to pass under the hands and ceremonies of a titular bishop, or under the natural hands of a titular eldership, or to have the call of a people, by the power of stipend or contribu|tion, without one of which no contract&mdash;all which I ac|count as human, at the best.</P>
<P>A 5th word I have to say, is in that you send your reader to a book printed by Mr. Edward Winslow, for a more full and perfect intelligence. Mr. Winslow and my|self had humanlike correspondency in England, and before the honourable committee which he referred himself to, as above: and, not to wrong the dead, I saw nothing to the contrary, but that I had as good acceptation in the eyes of that committee as himself had; altho' he had a greater
<PB N="553" REF="009705_0281_0F7A464D832FF6B8">
charter and larger commission, out of these parts, than my|self then had; and, however he was a man of more eminent part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than myself, yet the goodness and justice of my cause did equalize myself unto him, in those occasions, both in the minds and demeanors of our superiors. I do profes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I do not know or remember any particulars in that book he then pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forth:&mdash;I saw it in London, but read little of it; and when I came over into these parts, my ancient ac|quaintance and friend, Mr. John Brown, discoursing with me about those affairs in England, told me he had read such a book, printed or put forth by Mr. Winslow: I told him I had seen it, but read very little of it. Mr. Brown, you know, was a man approved of among you, an assistant in your government, a commissioner for the united colonies, &amp;c. who thus spake unto me in our discourse (I will not per|vert nor alter a word of the will or words of the dead) I say, he affirmed thus unto me, <HI>That he would maintain, that there were</HI> 40 <HI>lies printed in that book.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NUMBER XXI. Major WALLEY's Journal in the Expedition against Canada in 1692.</HEAD>
<HEAD>A narrative of the proceedings to Canada, soe far as concerned the land army.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING passed the isle of Percey, and being put back by a contrary wind, it was designed there to have landed our souldiers, to have settled our companys, to have called a council of warr, to have made and declared such orders as was necessary for regulating our forces, but by several of our ships and vessels being drove out of the harbour by a storm, they came not in again seasonably, and soe what was intended was prevented.</P>
<P>UPON the 23d of Sept. wee came to an anchor at Tar|rasack,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tadousack.</NOTE> a council of warr was called, such orders and ordi|nances made as was judged necessary, and ordered to be published in every vessel, and at the head of each com|pany, which orders are upon record and may be seen.</P>
<P>UPON the 27th of Sept. being about 25 leagues from Cabeck,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quebeck.</NOTE> I went aboard each vessel in the fleet, that had souldiers, to take care that they might be all ready and fixt for the service, not knowing how soon there might be occasion; and whereas there had been complaints, that, aboard several of the vessels, the souldiers and others had near a third part of their allowance taken off without or|der, I then gave orders that their full allowance might be given them.</P>
<P>UPON the 5th Oct. wee came up with the Isle of Or|leans, the whole fleet together, and having promised our men, that they should with the first convenience be landed to refresh themselves, and not having opportunity before, thought it might doe well to doe it then, proposing to the council that wee might then settle the companys, that wee
<PB N="555" REF="009705_0282_0F7A464F997067C8">
might then secure the island, gaine intelligence, and upon our informations to draw up such conclusions as were ne|cessary, and not to have appeared in sight of the town un|till wee were fully ready to fall upon them; but it was over-ruled by the council, and agreed we should take the advantage of the tide and be in sight of the town by day light, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>UPON the 6th Oct. it was concluded that a summons should be sent ashore, and, while the answer was coming, to put ourselves in the best posture wee could for landing, but by that time the messenger was returned wee found the tides did not sute, and that it would be too late to land that night. It was alsoe then agreed upon, that the army should land at the north shore, at the place wee after landed at; that the small vessels, that had guns, should take in the ammunition, provision, field pieces, shovels, spades and other necessarys for the souldiers, (that tide or the next they were to come up to Charles river, that lyes by the town,) that the ships boats should come into the river to be helpfull to carry the souldiers over, and the souldiers to be ready by the river when they came, that so they might be helpful each to other, as there had been occasion; that the field pieces should come in those vessels to be landed on the other side the river; it was alsoe agreed that, when wee were over the river, the men of warr were to sail up with the town, and when they perceived wee were upon the hill, especially if we then fired a house, they were then to land 200 men under their guns, and were to make a brisk and resolute charge to enter the town; alsoe agreed that Shute and others of the larger vessels that were not men of warr, were to goe beyond the town, that the enemy might thinke we had another army to land there; alsoe agreed that wee should have two ministers and three chirurgeons ashore.</P>
<P>THESE things being thus agreed on, on the next morning being the 7th Oct. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attempted to land our men, but by a storm were prevented, few of the boats be|ing able to row a head, and found it would endanger our
<PB N="556" REF="009705_0283_0F7A465080D50340">
men and wett our armes, at which time the vessel Capt. Savage was in went ashore, the tide fell, left them dry, the enemy came upon them, they manfully defended them|selves. I went aboard several vessels, and, though with some difficulty, caused some small vessels that had guns to weigh&punc; and sent some boats that endeavoured to help them, or if no other way to bring off the men, but the weather and shoals were such they could do them noe good; the enemy were awed by some guns from Sir William, that the short flew among the thickest of them, alsoe by some guns from Capt. Eldridge. At the tides coming in they floated and all gott off safe. That night, aboard Sir William's ship, the French prisoners informed us of a place about two miles beyond the town, that would be more commodious for landing the army, which I then thought might be best, (but Capt. Davis saith since, wee should not a mended our selves) but it was said the council of warr had determined the place, and wee had not time to call them together then, and it would be safest to attend order.</P>
<P>THE next day, being the 8th Oct. as soon as the bad weather was over and the tides suited, wee landed our men, which considering how farr many of our vessels were from the shoar, and the helps wee had, never more men were landed in less time; but the flatts lay off soe we were forced to go into the water, some up to the knees, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> near as high as their wasts upon the flatts. I drew up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole army, which consisted of between 12 and 1300 men, caused four companys to be drawn out as forlorns, though the ground would not admitt the forlorn and main battle to be far the one from the other; this being done, I ordered the forlorns to advance and to march, at their open order, towards the upland, and by this time the tide was upon the ground wee stood on: The forlorn were no sooner advanced a few rods, before there was firing from both sides&punc; upon one wing some of our men saw the ene|my in the bushes and fired first, but upon the other wing, and in most places, the enemy had the first shot at us; and from a village over a creek on our right wing, there was
<PB N="557" REF="009705_0283_0F7A465080D50340">
a party gauled us considerably; upon the charge our officers and souldiers shewed courage and resolution enough, yet some having given an order to fire and fall off, but judg|ing under the present circumstances, ordered the whole body to shoot and run up at once, which they did with one consent, that it was hard to say which company went up first or fastest; upon which, the enemy having generally made a second shott, they gave way at once, and by the convenience of swamps and bushes, they had an opportuni|ty to run away and secure themselves, but yet in partys out of every corner of a swamp or thicket they kept firing upon us; wee continued our chase and march towards the town, and killed some of the enemy as wee went. Being informed that the enemy had fired at our men out of a barn, and judging there were some in it, I ordered it to be fired; we come up with a house where was a hogshead of claret sett at the door, and seeing our souldiers gather about it, least it were poisoned, or might otherwise harm our men or hinder our march, I ordered the head to be knocked out; drawing nearer the town and finding the army too much scattered, and not knowing but wee might be met withall by a force from the town, I drew up a good part of our forces and marcht on; wee continued our march until it was dark, two thirds of the army took up their stand by a creek, where was a house and some other shelter, with the other part I advanced about a quar|ter of a mile, that we might the better secure the shoar and to see our vessels that were to come into the river; there wee took up our quarters, placed our out guards and sentinels, and did what was necessary for securing ourselves and taking notice of the motion of the enemy; wee then took the advantage of the house, barn, hay and straw, that those that were not upon duty might keep themselves as warm as they could. Making inquiry what damage wee had received from the enemy, or done to them, found wee had not above 4 killed outright at our landing, nor less than 60 officers and souldiers wounded, and it was judged wee had killed 20, some say 30 of the enemy, and since,
<PB N="558" REF="009705_0284_0F7A465098FF4AC0">
have been informed their hospital is full of wounded men, and it is said they had not less than 7 or 800 men that lay undiscovered to take the advantage at our landing; all things considered, it was a great mercy wee had no more damage done us. The same evening, having information of a Frenchman that had surrendered himself and was with the other part of the army, I sent for him and strictly examined him, severely threatned him if I caught him in a lye, told him wee had taken other French prisoners, and if he told us any thing that was false wee should soon find it. He told us wee should cut him in pieces if he told us any thing but what was truth; he informed that there were a|bout 600 men that were in the swamp at our coming ashore, that there was a Captain and other officers killed, besides others that he saw, that the French had 900 men from the town, more, upon their march towards us, that they were over the river, but seeing wee had landed our men soe suddainly, and beaten the French off the ground, and were marching towards the town, that they retreated, marcht back to the town, or at least to the other side of the river: He said the Earl of Frontenack was come down, the gover|nor of Mount Royal and the intendant; that a great many souldiers came into Cabeck on the Thursday before, a great many with the governor upon Fryday, and more with the governor of Mount Royal on Saturday, and many since: He alsoe said he was a souldier of Mount Royal that had run away, and that they were seeking after him (which wee after found true) He alsoe said, he came by the in|formation by a Mount Royal souldier, that he had mett withall, which acquainted him they had lost but 50 souldiers at Mount Royal, and added, that he had heard some French officers, at the next house to that wee then were at, say, that they had not less than 3000 men in the town; he alsoe said, that at the most convenient place of the souldiers goeing over they had planted 8 guns. All which, after|wards, we had confirmed. That others might not be discouraged, wee told him he was sent by the enemy to tell us a parsel of lies, but he said he had told us nothing but what we should find true.</P>
<P><PB N="559" REF="009705_0284_0F7A465098FF4AC0">AFTER this, I sent for the rest of the forces to come over, that wee might not be too much scattered, and sent for the majors and captains, and such as belonged to the council of warr, to consider and conclude what was farther to be done; after some discourse, it was concluded by the whole, that, for as much as the vessels were not come up the river with our supplyes of provision, ammunition, and other necessaries, neither the boats for transporting our men, that, as matters were thus circumstanced, wee were not in a capacity to advance, but hoped the vessels would be in with the tide, that was before day, and that if they came, wee would be ready to be helpfull to defend them, as we expected help from them; but the winds prevented their coming, as the masters after said. Before day, con|trary to order, and without my knowledge, they landed the six field pieces, at the point near which the army lay, which greatly clogg'd us, and would a made our passidge over the river very difficult. In the evening, wee see Capt. Gilbert weigh anchor, and the ships of warr sail up to the town, and the several ships plying their guns upon the town, and the town upon them, with utmost diligence; but the reason of their going before the land army were over the river, wee understood not till afterwards. The cold of the night, and our souldiers not having opportunity to dry themselves until the next day, proved very preju|ditiall to them. Upon the 9th of October, Sir William's ship returned from the town, being, as wee were informed, very much disinabled, having been very smartly engaged with the town, alsoe were informed, that the men of warr had not powder enough left for two rounds apeice; but, however, supposing they had secured and would supply us with what was promised, and reckning it was aboard the small vessels that were to come into the river, we still ex|pected their coming in, and that day advanced nearer the town, where wee had better shelter for the men, and a better place for our defence, where we placed out our guards, and put ourselves in the best posture we could to defend ourselves and offend our enemies, if they had come upon
<PB N="560" REF="009705_0285_0F7A46514D185B20">
us; sent out partys to gain intelligence and make discovery, and what provision came within our reach was killed for the use of the army; our provisions being so much in the masters of the vessels power, and not in the commissary-generals order and dispose, proved a great damidge, for, by reason hereof, some souldiers were provided for and others wanted, and all the rum that could be procured, to refresh the souldiers, was only about 60 gallons, which was spared from Sir William's ship, the rest either had it not, or would not own they had.</P>
<P>OUR souldiers dried themselves, gott what refreshment they could, and hoped the vessels might come in the evening tide, wee seeing more and more need of them, being more and more sensible of the enemies strength, and our own men, many, growing sick and unfitt for service. But the vessels not coming, we stood upon our guard that night, but found it exceeding cold, it freezing that night soe that the next morning the ice would bear a man. That night I called a council, demanded their opinion what was to be done, for it would be to no purpose to lye there; one in behalf of sundry others said, they had been together con|sidering thereof, and that for as much as we had not suita|ble supplys of provisions ashore, little or no ammunition to recruit if there should be occasion, that our men were, ma|ny, sick and wearied, that they had the difficultys of the river to deal with, neither boats nor vessels to help us in our going over, that we had 8 great guns and 1000 men at the river side that were ready for us, after that, a steep bank and narrow passage to win, up or through which wee should not a been able to have carried our great guns, nei|ther could wee have carried them over, where wee might have had them for use, without the help of our boats or vessels, after all this, a well fortified town with three times our number of men within to encounter with, having but one chirurgeon ashore, though three were ordered, the in|creasing cold weather, the enemy being capable and had a fair opportunity, had we gone over, by reason of their men on our backs and guns by Charles river, to cut off all sup|plys
<PB N="561" REF="009705_0285_0F7A46514D185B20">
and preventing our sending off soe much as a wounded man; after some discourse on these matters it was con|cluded, as I understood, by the whole, that I should goe on board that morning to Sir William, and acquaint him with our difficultys and disappointments, and that it was their agreement, if he were willing, that the army should get aboard that night or before day, and that they should rest and refresh themselves a day or two, and if they found they had ammunition suitable, they were ready to land at any other place, or under the guns at the town, if the counsel should soe conclude; there was that day two men to each gun sent ashore, a barrel of powder for the great guns, and half a barrel besides, and 100 wt. of bullets or something more.</P>
<P>THE 10th, before noon, I went aboard to Sir William, acquainted him how matters went ashore, and of the desire and conclusion of the officers; he said he could a been glad we had been capable to have proceeded, but consented to their coming aboard, and said the boats should be sent a|shore before day; after I had been aboard a while, wee heard guns goe off ashore and perceived our out guards were charged by the enemy; I was going off, but, perceiv|ing it was soon over, staid a while, and in the afternoon went ashore again, found our guards and some scouts had been engaged by the enemy; Major Savage sent reliefs as was necessary, but being informed that the enemy might be 1000 men over the river, he sent Capt. Corwin with orders that the souldiers should make an orderly retreat, for if the enemy were numerous it were better to prepare to meet them in the plain fields than among the swamps; wee had 4 men wounded, one died of his wounds, and, through hast in the retreat, a small drummer left his drum behind him; they did considerable damage to the enemy, but could not give a certain and particular account there|of, they fired several houses and barns and returned, but the enemy see no cause to follow them. That night wee kept a very strong and strict watch, I acquainted the soul|diers of their coming aboard; after midnight several of the
<PB N="562" REF="009705_0286_0F7A465210221C98">
commanders desired we might remove our army nearer to the place where we were to goe off, accordingly wee silently marched off the ground, carryed back our guns; when I had taken care that wee had left none behind, I went to the place where they were ordered to march, found our souldiers too many of them upon the beach ready to goe off if there had been an opportunity; I caused them to be drawn up upon the upland adjoining, and put them in a posture for service if they had been attacked by the enemy, for wee were within sight and hearing of the town. Before day the boats began to row ashore, but soe many of our men drew off without orders, that they might be ready to get in with the first, I foreseeing the confu|sion that was like to be, and perceiving there would not be time before it was light to get all off, I sent the boats all away and would not let any goe off at that time.</P>
<P>THE 11th day, being soe near as to heare them calling one to another at the town, their drumming and ringing before day, and other noises in the woods, that wee had reason to thinke they intended that day to come out a|gainst us with their whole strength; in the morning they fired several great guns at us but did us no harm, our men all that day standing to their arms, drums beating, colours flying, fair in sight of the town, we saw several of the enemy not far from us, and many on the other side of the river, besides what was in the town; it is said that Capt. Davis <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Davis was then a prisoner at Quebec, taken at Casco bay.</NOTE> reckoned, what they had in the town and that alarm|ed us and guarded their shoars, they were more then 4000 men; they sent out 7 or 800 fresh men dayly to alarm us and to watch our motions. Designing to goe off that night, and there being like to be a good opportunity, I called several of the officers and acquainted them that I was designed to send three parties of souldiers to beat up the swamps that were round us, and beat off these spies that we had reason to judge lay near us, accordingly order|ed three 16 files to be detached out of the several compa|nies, and sent them out commanded by Capt. Barnet, and Capt. Minot, and that party that was sent out upon our

right wing were soon engaged; sent Capt. March forth|with, who had a good company, and they then soon made the enemy give back, but they continued firing briskly at each other; I sent out several companys to relieve them, in the mean time not knowing but this party might have been sent to occasion the drawing off a great part of our forces, and they might have a greater strength near us, wherefore I sent out to make discovery, and stood ready with the rest of the army to fight them if they had come up with us. The souldiers were ordered to keep firing at the enemy, in and about the swamps near us and where they saw the enemy until it was dark, which accordingly they did.</P>
<P>IT then growing near night, I ordered the sick men to be carried aboard, which might be done by day light, be|cause two or three boats might goe off well enough un|suspected. That day, Alexander Smart came ashore with a commission to be master gunner, and had 52 seamen un|der his command for to attend the guns. A little before night, I called him and acquainted him that the army was to goe off that night, and gave him a charge about the guns, in particular ordered that three guns should goe off before any men went, or with the first, the other should be let alone to the last and kept for to defend the soldiers if there had been occasion, and to be put aboard the last boats, which might be soon done; he made me answer that, though he was the last man aboard, he would see all the guns off; I parted with him then and never see him afterwards that I knew of; I then acquainted Major Savage and other officers, that wee would draw off half each regiment at a time, and he should draw off half his regiment first, and or|dered that those that went in the first boats should be help|ful to draw down those three guns that were to goe first aboard, which they did, and concluded they were gone a|board. It growing very dark, notwithstanding I had or|dered the officers to keep the souldiers to their arms, many precipitately and disorderly drew down to the beach, four times more than had leave, and a very great noise was

made, which I was much troubled at, and was willing to go down to see if I could still them; I called to Major Ward, ordered him he should do what he could to keep the soul|diers to their arms, and not to move without order, which he soon found too hard for him to doe; I ordered some souldiers to keep the rest from crowding down until those were gone off that were upon the flats; I called to them to be silent, but either of these were little regarded, for the croud and the noise both increased; the seamen c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lling out for such souldiers as belonged to their vessels, and the souldiers for such boats as came from the vessels they be|longed to, hundreds in the water up to the knees and higher, pressing into boats, the seamen and they contending, by reason whereof I see boats were like to be five times longer a loading than they needed; I saw a necessity of my going off to the boats, went aboard a small boat belonging to Mr. Winser, commanded silence, ordered the boats to take the men in, as they came, and to carry them to the first vessels they came at, which was not minded by many, but as I was forced to goe from boat to boat and see it done, for otherways some of the seamen would throw the souldiers overboard if they did not belong to them, or the souldiers would have pressed into boats to have sunk them. After my being at the point not less than three hours, the men were most off, and every thing still quiet; the boats were all gone, I began to think because I see none a coming they thought the men were all off, I questioned how many men were upon the point, some said 150, wee judged about 100 or 120, I told them I would see if any boats were coming, rowed off and heard several boats rowing, went to them and ordered them to hasten to the shoar; and though I thought there might be enough to take off all the men, yet they should rather have too many than want, I told them I would go to the next vessels that had boats aboard and send them away, which I did with all speed. Being now well satisfied our men were safe off, I went on board Sir William's ship, I acquainted how matters were, told him I hoped the guns were off, for did not see them

when I came away; he made answer he questioned, for the master gunner had been aboard long before, and could not give account they were off, immediately came one of the gunners aboard, with a gun, and said that the guns were all off. I then being satisfied that both men and gun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were all off, I went to my cabbin, to take my rest, having had but little for 3 days and nights before. Soon after, Mr. Dearing came aboard, who came off in the last parsel of boats, and acquainted some of the officers and divers others, that there was 5 of the guns ashore, that they had been under water, but appeared when he came away, they did not acquaint Sir William nor myself of it, until the next morning, for wee had come off undiscovered, and there was 4 or 5 hours time that they might been easily and safely fetcht, but that was neglected; they sent in the morning, but then it was too late.</P>
<P>THE 12th day a council was called, several, but not all the commanders aboard, they discoursed of landing at the town, or at Orleance, may of the officers declared that many of their men were sick and unfitt for service; how|ever, it was agreed that the men should have a day or two's time to refresh themselves, and to inquire what capacity wee were in for a further attempt, and some time should be spent on Monday in prayer, to seek God's direction, but the weather prevented our meeting, and wee necessitated to weigh and fall down to Orleance, many vessels drove from their anchors, and were in danger of being drove on upon the town; wee then sent ashore about our captives, but winds and weather after proved such, as wee had never opportunity to come together, but the whole fleet were scattered, and such exceeding hard cold and windy weather sett in for 3 weeks or a month together, as I never was in so much together.</P>

<P>THE land army's failing, the enemy's too timely in|telligence, lyeing 3 weeks within 3 days sail of the place, by reason whereof they had opportunity to bring in the whole strength of their country, the shortness of our ammunition, our late setting out, our long passidge, and many sick in the army, these may be reckned as some of the reasons of our disappointment.</P>
<P>SOME question our courage, that wee proceeded no further; as things were circumstanced, others would a questioned our prudence, if wee had; were it a fault, it was the act of a council of warr; wee must undergoe the censures of many: In the mean time, our consciences doe not accuse us, neither are we most, yea allmost all, of us, afraid or ashamed to answer our actions, before any that can or shall call us to an account for the same, nor un|willing to give any farther satisfaction to any reasonable men that shall desire it.</P>
