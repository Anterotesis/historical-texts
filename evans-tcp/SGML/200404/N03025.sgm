the following Declaration, which was carefully taken from her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Mouth.</HEAD>
<P>BEING under the awful App<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ehension<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
of my Execution now in a few Hours;
and being desirous to do all the Good
I can, before I enter the Eternal
Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">, I now in the fear of GOD, give this
Declaration and Warning to the Living.</P>
<P>I Was very tenderly brought up, and well In|struct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d
in my Father's House, till I was
Twelve Years of Age; but alass, my Child|hood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> off in vanity. However, as I grew
in Years, my Youth was under very sensible
Impressions from the SPIRIT of GOD; and
I was awakened to seek and obtain Baptism,
when I was about Sixteen Years of Age; and
lived for some time with a strictness somewhat
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">swerable to the Obligations I was thereby
brought under. But within two or three Years
after this, I was led away i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> to the Sin of Un|cleannes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">,
from which ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">e I think I may d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">te
my Ruin for this World. After this&punc; I became
again more watchful, and for several Years kep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
my self from the like Pollution<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">, until those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
which I am now to suffer.</P>
<P>And as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> be necessary, so do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">btless it
will be expected of me, that I give the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ld
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> particular account of that great Sin, with the
aggravations of it, which has brought me to
this Shameful Death: And accordingly in the
fear of GOD, at whose awful Tribunal I am
immediately to appear, I solemnly declare as
follows&punc;</P>
<P>That on Saturday the Fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> last,
being then something more than Eight Months
gon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> with Child, as I was about my Houshold
Business reaching some San<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> from out of a
large Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">k, I received considerable hurt,
which put me into great Pain, and so I conti|nued
till the Tuesday following; in all which
time I am not sensible I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">elt any Life or Motion
in the Child within me; when, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
Tuesday the Eighth Day of <HI>May,</HI> I was D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">li|ver'd
when alo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">e of a Male Infa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">t; in whom
I did not p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">rceive Life; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ill uncertain of
Life <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">t, I threw it into the Vault about two
or three Minutes after it was born; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">,
I say, whether it was a living or dead Child&punc;
tho, I confess <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> probable there was Life in it,
and some Circum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ances seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> it.
I therefore own the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">tice of GOD and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
in my Condemnation, and take Shame to my
self, as I have none but my self to Blame&punc; and
am so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ry for any rash Expressions I have at any
time uttered since my Condem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ation; and I
am verily pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">swaded there is no Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">n the
World, where there is a more st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ict <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">egard to
Justice than in this Province.</P>
<P>And now as a Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> going into Etern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech">, I
most earnestly and solemnly Warn all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">,
particularly YOUNG PEOPLE, and more
especially those of my own Sex, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> the
Sins which their Age peculiarly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> them
to; and as the Sin of Uncleanness has brought
me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nto these distressing Circumstances, I would
with the greatest Importunity C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">tion and Warn
against it, being p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">rswaded of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
of that Sin in this Town and Land. I tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ht
my self as secure, a little more than a Year ago,
as many of you now do; but by woful Expe|rience
I have found, that Lust when it has con|ceived
bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">geth forth Sin, and Sin when it is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">nished bringet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> forth Death; it exposes the
Soul not only to Temporal, but to Eternal Death.
And therefore as a Dying Person&punc; let me call
upon you to forsake the foolish and live: Do
not accompany with those you know to be such&punc;
and if Sinners en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ice you do not cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nt. I
am sensible there are many Houses in this Town,
that may be called Houses of Uncleanness, and
Places of dreadful Temptations to this and all
other Sins. O shun them, for they lead down
to the Chambers of Death and Eternal Misery.</P>
<P>My misp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ce of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech"> as a
heavy burden upon me; that when I might
have gone to the House of GOD, I have been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">, and suffer'd a small matter to keep
me from i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">&punc; What would I now give, had I
better improv'd the Lord'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> Day! I tell you,
ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ly, your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Sabbath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> will sit heavy upon
you, when you come into the near prospect of
Death and Eternity.</P>
<P>The Sin of Lying I have to bewail, and wou'd
earnestly caution against; not that I have took
so great a pleasure in Lying; but I have often
done so to conceal my Sin: Certainly you had
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">er suffer Shame and Disgrace, yea the great|est
Punishment, than to hide and conceal your
Sin, by Lying. How much better had it been
for me, to have confess'd my Sin, than by h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d|in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
of it to provoke a holy GOD, thus to suffer
it to find me out. But I hope I heartily desire
to bless GOD, that even in this way, He is
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> entring into Judgment with me; for I have
often thought, had I been let alone to go on
undiscovered in my Sins, I might have provok'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> in to leave me to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> of Rebellion, that
would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> me for a more sudden, and
everlasting Destruction; and am fully convinc'd
of this, that I should have had no solid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ase or
quiet in my mind, but the Guilt of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ndis|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">over'd
Sin lying upon my Conscience, would
have been a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Rack unto me all my
Days; where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ow I hope GOD has discover'd
to me in some measure the evil of this, and all my
othe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech"> enabled me to repent of them in

and think I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d not for a World, nay
for ten Thousand Worlds have my liberty in
Sin again, and be in the same Condition I was
in before I came into this Place.</P>
<P>I had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> advantage of living in several reli|giou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">lies; but alass, I disregarded the In|structions
and War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ings I there had, which is
now a bitterness to me; and so it will be to
those of you who are thus fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">oured, but go on
unmindful of GOD, and deaf to all the Re|proofs
and Admonitions that are given you for
the good of your Souls. And I would advise
those of my own Sex especially, to chuse to go
into religious Families, where the Worship and
Fear of GOD is ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">tained, and submit your
selves to the Orde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> and Government of them.</P>
<P>In my younger Years I maintain'd a constant
cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">se of Secret Pray<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> for some time; but after|wards
neglecting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ame, I found by experience,
that upon my thus leaving GOD, He was provoked
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> me, and at length suffer'd me to fall
into that great and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> that has
brought me to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> Death: Mind me, I first l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ft
GOD, and then He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> me: I therefore so|l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">mnly
call upon YOUNG PEOPLE to cherish
the Convictio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">s of GOD's Holy SPIRIT, and
be sure keep up a consta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">t course of fervent Se|cret
Prayer.</P>
<P>And now I am just entring <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nto the Eternal
World, I do in the fear of GOD, and before
Witnesses, call upon our YOUNG PEOPLE in
particular, to secure an Interest in the Lord
JESUS CHRIST, and in those precio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> Bene|fits
He has purchased for His People; for sure|ly
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">avour of GOD, thro' CHRIST, is more

will this yield you when you c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">me to that
awful Day and Hour I am now arriving unto.
I must tell you the World appears to me vain
and empty, nothing like what it did in my pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">t
Life, my Days of Sin and Vanity, and as doubt|less
it appears now to you. Will you be per|swaded
