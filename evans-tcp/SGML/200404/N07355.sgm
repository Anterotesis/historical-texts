<HEAD>A
Looking Glass, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L><HI>NEW-England</HI> for these many Years</L>
<L>hath had both Rest and Peace,</L>
<L>But now the Case is otherwise;</L>
<L>our Trouble doth encrease.</L>
<L>The plague of War is now begun</L>
<L>in some great Colonies,</L>
<L>And many Towns as desolate</L>
<L>we may see with our Eyes.</L>
<L>The Loss of many goodly Men</L>
<L>we may lament also,</L>
<L>Who in the War have lost their lives,</L>
<L>and fallen by our Foe.</L>
<L>Our Women also they have took,</L>
<L>and Children very small;</L>
<L>Great Cruelty they have used</L>
<L>to some, tho' not to all.</L>
<L>The Enemy that hath done this,</L>
<L>are very foolish Men;</L>
<L>Yet God doth make of them a Rod</L>
<L>to punish us for Sin.</L>
<L>If we then truly turn to God,</L>
<L>he will remove his Ire,</L>
<L>And will forthwith take this his Rod</L>
<L>And cast it into Fire.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="009388_0003_0F73445418EAE418">
Let us then search what is the Sin</L>
<L>that God doth punish for;</L>
<L>And when found out cast it away,</L>
<L>and ever it abhor.</L>
<L>Sure 'tis not chiefly for those Sins</L>
<L>that Magistrates do name,</L>
<L>And make good Laws for to suppress,</L>
<L>and execute the same.</L>
<L>But 'tis for that same crying Sin,</L>
<L>that Rulers will not own,</L>
<L>And that whereby much Cruelty</L>
<L>to brethren hath been shown:</L>
<L>The Sin of Persecution</L>
<L>such Laws established;</L>
<L>By which Laws they have gone so far,</L>
<L>as Blood hath touched Blood.</L>
<L>It is now Forty Years ago,</L>
<L>since some of these were made,</L>
<L>Which was the Ground and Rise of all</L>
<L>the persecuting Trade.</L>
<L>Then many worthy Persons were</L>
<L>banished to the Woods,</L>
<L>Where they among the Natives did</L>
<L>lose their most precious Bloods.</L>
<L>And since that, many Godly Men</L>
<L>have been to Prison sent;</L>
<L>They have been fin'd and whip'd also,</L>
<L>and suffer'd Banishment.</L>
<L>The Cause of this their Suffering</L>
<L>was not for any Sin,</L>
<L>But for the Witness that they bare</L>
<L>against Babes Sprinkling.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="009388_0004_0F734457B42E3B08">
Of later time there hath been some</L>
<L>Men come into this Land,</L>
<L>To warn the Rulers of their Sins,</L>
<L>as I do understand.</L>
<L>They call'd on all, both great and small,</L>
<L>to fear God and repent;</L>
<L>And for their Testimonies thus</L>
<L>they suffer'd Punishment.</L>
<L>Yea, some of them they did affirm,</L>
<L>that they were sent of God</L>
<L>To testify to great and small,</L>
<L>that God would send his Rod</L>
<L>Against those Colonies, because</L>
<L>they did make Laws not good;</L>
<L>And if those Laws were not repeal'd,</L>
<L>the end would be in Blood.</L>
<L>And tho' that these were harmless Men,</L>
<L>and did no hurt to any,</L>
<L>But lived well like honest Men,</L>
<L>as testify'd by many;</L>
<L>Yet did these Laws entrap them so,</L>
<L>that they were put to Death,</L>
<L>And could not have the Liberty</L>
<L>to speak near their last Breath.</L>
<L>But these Men were, as I have heard,</L>
<L>against our <HI>College Men;</HI></L>
<L>And this was out of doubt to me,</L>
<L>that which was most their Sin.</L>
<L>They did reprove all <HI>Hirelings,</HI></L>
<L>with a most Sharp Reproof,</L>
<L>Because they knew not how to preach,</L>
<L>till sure of Means enough.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="009388_0005_0F7344585180D9A8">
Now to the Sufferings of these Men,</L>
<L>I have but gave a hint;</L>
<L>Because that in <HI>George Bishop</HI>'s Book</L>
<L>you may see all in print.</L>
<L>But may we know the Counsellors</L>
<L>that brought our Rulers in,</L>
<L>To be so guilty as they are,</L>
<L>of the aforesaid Sin?</L>
<L>They were the Tribe of Ministers,</L>
<L>as they are said to be,</L>
<L>Who always to our Magistrates</L>
<L>must be the Eyes to see.</L>
<L>These are the Men that by their Wits,</L>
<L>have spun so fair a Thread,</L>
<L>That now themselves and others are</L>
<L>of Natives in a Dread.</L>
<L>What need is there of such a Fear,</L>
<L>if we have done no Ill?</L>
<L>But 'tis because that we have been</L>
<L>not doing of God's Will.</L>
<L>When <HI>Cain</HI> had slain his Brother, then</L>
<L>began this Fear to be,</L>
<L>That every Man would do to him</L>
<L>the same that did him see.</L>
<L>The Scripture doth declare the Cause</L>
<L>why <HI>Cain</HI> did kill his Brother;</L>
<L>It was because the Deeds of one</L>
<L>was good, and not the other.</L>
<L>Because that God did Favour show</L>
<L>To <HI>Abel</HI> more than he,</L>
<L>That was in verity the thing</L>
<L>that Envy could not see.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="009388_0006_0F734458AC6E34E0">
Then let us all, both great and small</L>
<L>take heed how we do fight</L>
<L>Against the Spirit of the Lord,</L>
<L>which is our highest Light.</L>
<L>Let Magistrates and Ministers</L>
<L>consider what they do;</L>
<L>Let them repeal those evil Laws,</L>
<L>and break those Bands in two,</L>
<L>Which have been made as Traps and Snares</L>
<L>to catch the Innocents,</L>
<L>And whereby it has gone so far,</L>
<L>to Acts of Violence.</L>
<L>I see you write your selves in Print,</L>
<L>the Balm of Gilead;</L>
<L>Then do not act as if you were</L>
<L>like Men that are half mad.</L>
<L>If you can heal the Land, what is</L>
<L>the Cause things are so bad?</L>
<L>I think instead of that, you make</L>
<L>the Hearts of People sad.</L>
<L>Is this a Time for you to press,</L>
<L>to draw the Blood of those</L>
<L>That are your Neighbours and your Friends,</L>
<L>as if you had no Foes.</L>
<L>Yea, some there are, as I have heard,</L>
<L>have lately found out Tricks</L>
<L>To put the Cause of all the War</L>
<L>upon the <HI>Hereticks,</HI></L>
<L>Or rather on some Officers,</L>
<L>that now begin to slack</L>
<L>The Execution of those Laws,</L>
<L>whose Consequence is black.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="009388_0007_0F734459664925C0">
I do affirm to you, if that</L>
<L>be really your mind,</L>
<L>You must go turn another Leaf,</L>
<L>before that Peace you find.</L>
<L>Now loving Friends and Country-Men,</L>
<L>I wish we may be wise;</L>
<L>Tis now a time for every Man</L>
<L>to see with his own Eyes.</L>
<L>'Tis easy to provoke the Lord</L>
<L>to send among us War;</L>
<L>'Tis easy to do Violence,</L>
<L>to envy and to jar;</L>
<L>To shew a Spirit that is high,</L>
<L>to scorn and domineer;</L>
<L>To pride it out, as if there were,</L>
<L>no God to make us fear;</L>
<L>To covet what is not our own,</L>
<L>to cheat and to oppress;</L>
<L>To live a Life that might free us</L>
<L>from Acts of Righteousness;</L>
<L>To swear and lie, and to be drunk,</L>
<L>to backbite one another;</L>
<L>To carry Tales that may do hurt</L>
<L>and Mischief to our Brother!</L>
<L>To live in such Hypocrisy,</L>
<L>as Men may think us good,</L>
<L>Although our Hearts within are full</L>
<L>of Evil, and of Blood.</L>
<L>All these and many Evils more</L>
<L>are easy for to do;</L>
<L>But to repent, and to reform,</L>
<L>we have no Strength unto.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="009388_0008_0F73445A2168BFE8">
Let us then seek for help from God,</L>
<L>and turn to him that smite;</L>
<L>Let us take heed, that at no time,</L>
<L>we sin against our Light.</L>
<L>Let's bear our testimony plain</L>
<L>'gainst Sin in High and Low;</L>
<L>And see that we no Cowards be,</L>

<L>When <HI>Ionathan</HI> is call'd to Court,</L>

<L>If that you say you cannot help,</L>
<L>things will be as they are;</L>
<L>I tell you true, tis plain and clear,</L>
<L>those Words may come from fear.</L>
<L>That you shall lose some carnal things,</L>
<L>if you do speak for God;</L>
<L>And here you go the nearest way</L>
<L>to taste deep of his Rod.</L>
<L>'Tis true, there are some times indeed</L>

The Rulers in the Country I</L>
<L>do own them in the Lord;</L>
<L>And such as are for Government,</L>
<L>with them I do accord.</L>
<L>But that which I intend hereby,</L>
<L>is that they would keep bound,</L>
<L>And meddle not with God's Worship,</L>
<L>for which they have no ground.</L>
<L>And I am not alone herein,</L>
<L>there's many hundreds more</L>

<L>Indeed I really believe</L>
<L>it's not your Business</L>
<L>To meddle with the Church of Christ,</L>

<L>And I do think that now you find</L>
<L>enough of that to do;</L>
<L>Much more at such a Time as this,</L>
<L>as there is War also.</L>
<L>Indeed I count it very low,</L>
<L>for People in these Days,</L>
<L>To ask the Rulers for their leave</L>
<L>to serve God in his Ways.</L>
<L>I count it worse in Magistrates</L>
<L>to use the Iron Sword,</L>
<L>To do that Work which Christ alone</L>
<L>will do by his own Word.</L>
<L>The Church may now go stay at home,</L>
<L>there's nothing for to do;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="009388_0010_0F73445B9C3CF160">
Their Work is all cut out by Law,</L>
<L>and almost made up too.</L>
<L>Now Reader, least you should mistake,</L>
<L>in what I said before</L>
<L>Concerning Minister's, I think</L>
<L>to write a few Words more.</L>
<L>I would not have you for to think</L>
<L>that I am such a Fool,</L>
<L>To write against Learning, as such,</L>
<L>or to cry down a School.</L>
<L>But 'tis that <HI>Popish College</HI> way,</L>
<L>that I intend hereby,</L>
<L>Where Men are mew'd up in a Cage,</L>
<L>fit for all Villany.</L>
<L>But I shall leave this puddle Stuff</L>
<L>to Neighbours at the Door,</L>
<L>That can speak more unto such things,</L>
<L>upon a knowing Score.</L>
<L>And now these Men though ne'er so bad,</L>
<L>when they have learn'd their Trade,</L>
<L>They must come in and bear a Part,</L>
<L>whatever Laws are made.</L>
<L>I can't but wonder for to see</L>
<L>our Magistrates and Wise,</L>
<L>That they sit still, and suffer them</L>
<L>to ride on them, not rise,</L>
<L>And stir them up to do that Work,</L>
<L>that Scripture Rule there wants,</L>
<L>To persecute and persecute</L>
<L>those that they judge are Saints.</L>
<L>There's one thing more that I believe</L>
<L>is worse than all the rest,</L>
<L>They vilify the Spirit of God,</L>
<L>and count School Learning best.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="009388_0011_0F73445C59DC0E60">
If that a Boy hath learn'd his Trade,</L>
<L>and can the Spirit disgrace,</L>
<L>Then he is lifted up on high,</L>
<L>and needs must have a Place.</L>
<L>But I shall leave this dirty Stuff,</L>
<L>and give but here a hint,</L>
<L>Because that you have <HI>Cradock</HI>'s Book,</L>
<L>and may see more in Print.</L>
<L>There are some few, it may be, that</L>
<L>are clear of this same Trade;</L>
<L>And of those Men, I only say,</L>
<L>these Verses are not made.</L>
<L>Now for the length of time, how long</L>
<L>these Wars are like to be,</L>
<L>I may speak something unto that,</L>
<L>if Men will reason see.</L>
<L>The Scripture doth point out the time,</L>
<L>and 'tis as we do chuse,</L>
<L>For to obey the Voice of God,</L>
<L>or else for to refuse.</L>
<L>The Prophet <HI>Ieremy</HI> doth say,</L>
<L>when War is threatned sore,</L>
<L>That if Men do repent and turn,</L>
<L>God will afflict no more.</L>
<L>But such a turning unto God,</L>
<L>as is but Verbally,</L>
<L>When Men refuse for to reform,</L>
<L>it is not worth a fly.</L>
<L>'Tis hard for you, as I do hear,</L>
<L>though you be under Rod,</L>
<L><HI>To say to</HI> Israel Go, you,</L>
<L>and serve the Lord your God.</L>
<L>Though you do many Prayers make,</L>
<L>and add Fasting thereto,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="009388_0012_0F73445D19AB6558">
Yet if your Hands be full of Blood,</L>
<L>all this will never do.</L>
<L>The end that God doth send his Sword,</L>
<L>is that we might amend;</L>
<L>Then if that we reform aright,</L>
<L>the War will shortly end&punc;</L>
<L><HI>New-England</HI> they are like the <HI>Iews,</HI></L>

<L>They did proclaim free Liberty,</L>
<L>they cut the Calf in twain,</L>
<L>They past between the Part thereof:</L>
<L>O this was all in vain!</L>
<L>For since they came into this Land,</L>
<L>they floared to and fro,</L>
<L>Sometimes their Brethren may be free,</L>
<L>while hence to Prison go,</L>
<L>According as the times to go,</L>
<L>and Weather is abroad,</L>
<L>So we can serve our selves sometimes,</L>
<L>and sometimes serve the Lord.</L>
<L>But let us hear what God doth say</L>
<L>to such backsliding Men,</L>
<L>That can with Ease so break their Vows,</L>
<L>and soon go back again.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ier. 34.</NOTE></L>
<L>He saith he will proclaim for them,</L>
<L>a Freedom to the Sword,</L>
<L>Because they would not fear him so</L>
<L>as to obey his Word.</L>
<L>This Liberty unto the Sword,</L>
<L>he hath proclaim'd for us,</L>
<L>And we are like to feel it long,</L>
<L>if Matters do go thus.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="009388_0013_0F73445E09CC31A8">
'Tis better for our Magistrates,</L>
<L>to shorten time, I say,</L>
<L>By breaking of those Bands in two,</L>
<L>that look an evil way.</L>
<L>You do profess your selves to be</L>
<L>Men that do pray always,</L>
<L>Then do not keep such evil Laws,</L>

<L>If that the Peace of God did rule</L>
<L>with Power in our Heart,</L>
<L>Then outward War would flee away,</L>
<L>and Rest would be our Part.</L>
<L>If we could love our Brethren,</L>
<L>and do to them, I say,</L>
<L>As we would they should do to us,</L>
<L>we should be quiet straightway.</L>

<L>must make our Foes to shake,</L>

<L>know how to make us quake.</L>

<P>UPON reading this Day at the Board, a Report from

of Councils, upon the Petition of <HI>Thomas Richardson</HI>
and <HI>Richard Partridge,</HI> on behalf of <HI>Ioseph Anthony,
Iohn Sisson, Iohn Akin,</HI> and <HI>Phillip Taber,</HI> Prisoners in
the common Goal at <HI>New Bristol,</HI> in his Majesty's Pro|vince
of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> for not
assessing the Inhabitants of the Towns of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> and
<HI>Tiverton,</HI> the additional Taxes of one Hundred Pounds,
and Seventy two Pounds eleven Shillings, imposed up|on
them by an Act passed there in the Year 1722, which
appears to be for the Maintenance of Presbyterian Mi|nisters,
who are not of their Perswasion; and also in be|half
of their Friends called Quakers in general, who
are frequently under great Sufferings for Conscience
sake in that Government: By which Report it appears,
that their Lordships are of Opinion, that it may be ad|visable

<HEAD>To the KING's most Excellent Majesty,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Obedience to an Order in Council from the late
Lords Justices, during your Majesty's Absence abroad,
bearing date the 24th day of <HI>October</HI> last, we did make
a Representation upon an Act pass'd in the Province of
the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> in 1722. entituled,
<HI>An Act for apportioning and assessing a Tax of Six Thousand
two Hundred thirty two Pounds thirteen Shillings &amp; eleven
Pence.</HI> Since which Time another Act mention'd in the
said Order of Reference. passed the 29th day of <HI>May,
1723.</HI> entituled. <HI>An Act for apportioning and assessing a
Tax of Six Thousand two Hundred and five Pounds fifteen
Shillings &amp; seven Pence Half-Peny,</HI> is come to our Hands;
by which Act a Tax is laid in express Terms upon the
Inhabitants of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> and <HI>Tiverton,</HI> for the Support
of a Presbyterian, whom they call an Orthodox Minister,
which falls almost entirely upon the Quakers; there be|ing
very few Inhabitants of any other Perswasion in these
two Towns. But as by the Charter granted to this Pro|vince,
a free and absolute Liberty of Conscience to all
Christians (except Papists) was intended to have been
their Foundation and Support; and as by several Laws
passed there, it seems to have been laid down as a just
and equitable Rule, that the Majority of each Town-Congregation
should have the Choice of their own Teach|ers,
we cannot see why the Quakers should be refused this
Liberty in the Towns where they are so great a Majority,
and be obliged to maintain a Teacher of different Per|swasion.
Wherefore we humbly propose to your Majesty,
that this Act may be repealed.</P>
<CLOSER>Which is most humbly submitted,
