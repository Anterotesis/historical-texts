<HEAD>Instructions for young OFFICERS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By General <HI>WOLFE.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>WHEN a young Gentleman betakes himself to the profession of Arms, he should seriously reflect upon the nature and duties of the way of life he has entered into, and consider, that it is not as the generality of people vainly imagine, learning a little of the exercise, saluting gracefully, firing his pla|toon in his turn, mounting a few guards (carelessly enough) and finally, exposing his person bravely in the day of battle; which will deservedly, and in the opinion of judges, acquire him the character of a good officer: no, he must learn chearfully to obey his superiors, and that their orders and his own be punctually executed.</P>
<P>As there must of necessity be in a new battalion many young and uninformed officers, I shall, as briefly as I am capable, inform them what I think their duty, and what consequently is expected from them.</P>
<P>They are, without loss of time, to make themselves perfect masters of the ex|ercise of the firelock, that they may be able to assist in training the young soldiers in arms.</P>
<P>They are constantly to be present at roll-calling; and, as soon as they can, make themselves acquainted with the names and persons of the men of the com|panies they belong to; and as soon as possible with their characters, that they may know the proper subjects to encourage, and point out as examples, as well those also whom it will be necessary to keep a strict hold over.</P>
<P>They are to observe that the men are dressed in a soldier-like manner, and conformable to the orders of the regiment.</P>
<P>They are to get exact lists of the mens necessaries, and as well as the captains, of the arms, accoutrements, and stores.</P>
<P>They under the captains are to be answerable that the proportion of the soldiers pay, ordered by the commanding officer, be laid out in good &amp; wholsome provisions.</P>
<P>They are to visit their companies quarters at least thrice a week, see that they are kept clean, well aired, and beds made; and that if the landlords have any just cause of complaint against the soldiers, or the soldiers against the landlords, the aggrieved may, by application through the proper channel, find redress.</P>
<P>They should frequently chuse the hour of the soldiers dining for their visitation, that they may judge whether their victuals are comfortably cooked; they should particularly at that hour inspect the quarters of those men who are billetted upon house of the lowest class, as they are most likely to be prevailed upon, by the disobedient soldier, to give him liquor for his meat.</P>
<P>They must now-and-then occasionally go round the quarters between nine and eleven at night to see that the men keep regular hours conformable to orders, not always trusting to the reports of serjeants.</P>
<P>A young officer should never think he does too much; they are to attend to the looks of the men, and if any are thinner or paler than usual, the reasons of their falling off may be enquired into, and proper means used to restore them to their former vigour.</P>

<P>N. B. <HI>There are several other Manoeuvres, sometimes practis'd by the British Regiments in Europe. The Nature of the Service in America is such, that they are almost, if not entirely useless to the Troops serving in this Country, they are not therefore here inserted.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013319_0041_0F904F00A9186E78">In dressing Ranks, the Soldiers are to observe, to stand upright, and without stooping to cast their Eyes smartly to the Right and Left, and see the third Man's Breast, taking Care to keep Six Inches distance between the Files.</P>
<P>In covering their File Leaders, they must look between their Heads and the Firelocks.</P>
<P>In Marching and Wheeling, they must observe the same Rule as in dressing the Ranks, lift up their Feet with stiff Knees, and set them down firm without stamping, and not to drag the Feet back, but to move the Body, without shaking from one Side to the other.</P>
<P>In order the Divisions may wheel with Celerity, when they receive the Word <HI>March!</HI> the Flanks are to step off with a quick, but strong Pace. As soon as the Wheel is performed, a Signal is given from the Flank, on which they catch the slow Pace again.</P>
<P>In all Wheelings to the Right, the Men must cast their Eyes to the Left, except the Left-Hand Man: And in all Wheelings to the Left, they cast their Eyes to the Right, except the Right-Hand Man, observing to feel the Hand they wheel to, without crouding upon it.</P>
<P>The Performance of all Manoeuvres may be done either with a slow or a quick Pace, as the Commanding Officer shall think proper to direct.</P>
