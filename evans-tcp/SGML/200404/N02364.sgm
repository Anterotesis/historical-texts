<HEAD>The Necessity of a Tobacco-Law consider'd.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MANY of the Conveniences which attend a
<HI>Press</HI> in our Infant Country, as well as in
other Places, are obvious to all, both from the
Nature of the Thing, and from Experience:
Yet, One seems hitherto either not thought of,
or at least neglected, tho' it might, perhaps,
render your <HI>Press</HI> as useful to the Country, as it is in any
other Instance whatsoever; which is to make Publick the
Thoughts of any Well-Wisher of his Country, where he en|deavours
to discover any Thing that may be for a general
Good, which is the only End the Author of this following
Piece aims at: And he persuades himself you will readily Pub|lish
these his Thoughts, as well as those of any Others, when|ever
they will give themselves the Trouble of Communicating
them freely to you, upon such Occasions as require every
Ones best Endeavours to help themselves and their Country,
when the Whole seems in Danger of being involv'd in a ge|neral
Calamity, as is too manifestly our present Case; whilst
our <HI>Tobacco</HI> Trade, which is our entire Staple, is under the
most deplorable and languishing Condition, and never to be
reliev'd but by our selves.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002806_0003_0000000000000000">
And tho' several <HI>Tobacco-Laws</HI> have been made for this
Purpose; yet, by Experience, they have been found rather to
burthen and oppresst he Country in General, than afford it any
Relief or Advantage as they were designed: And altho' the
late Sessions of our Assembly were Conven'd at the general
Instance of the Country, as the Governour declared in his Speech
at the Opening thereof, purely to consider of some Means that
might relieve our sinking Trade and Country, yet none could
then be thought of, or agreed on, whereby that Meeting was
rendered Fruitless, and without any other Effect, than to en|crease
the Publick Charge.</P>
<P>When this is considered, it may seem to be too great a
Presumption for a private Person to suggest, that there is a Pos|sibility
left to remedy this Evil; and gives too much Dis|couragement
to any Attempt of that kind: Yet, as the Evil
is of such a Nature, that inevitable Ruin to the Whole, seems
to be the infallible Consequence of omitting the Application
of some Remedy, it is such a cogent Motive to excite, not
only the most melancholly Reflections and Concern, in every
individual Person, that is like to be involv'd in this general
Calamity, but also to induce each One to exert his utmost
Endeavours to find some Means to extricate our selves out of
these most deplorable Circumstances, that the Author per|suades
himself, the Publick will easily excuse the Trouble
he gives them, and give this Attempt a favourable Recep|tion,
since a general Good is his only View. And tho' it
should not have the Effect he hopes for, yet it will probably
put others that are more capable, upon something of the same
Nature, wherein what is a-miss here may be rectified and
amended; and upon the Whole, something may be discovered,
that may answer the desired End.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002806_0004_0000000000000000">
In order to effect this, it will not be a-miss to consider where
the Difficulty lies in concurring in a Business of so much Conse|quence,
and so unanimously desired: The chiefest appears to
be the Jealousy that is between the Two Houses of our Le|gislature;
for as the Upper House is chiefly constituted of such
Gentlemen who enjoy the most considerable Publick Offices
in the Province, which are attended with large Revenues;
And the Lower House, who are the Representatives of the
Country, have very few Advantages from those Publick
Offices, and are sensible that those they represent do not en|joy
any of these beneficial Places, they are therefore appre|hensive,
that whatever is suggested by any Member of the
other House, is with some private View. And further, that
whatever Law can be made to raise the Price of Tobacco, only
serves to inhance the Income of the Publick Officers, having
by Experience found, that the <HI>Tobacco-Laws</HI> which have
been made, have had scarce any other Effect, than Raising the
Price of Tobacco in the Country, without affecting the
Markets in <HI>Europe.</HI> This is certainly a Consequence which
ought to be avoided; otherwise any Attempt to relieve the
Province, which is attended with this Circumstance, wou'd
but the more speedily and effectually accomplish its Ruin.</P>
<P>To obviate this, many Attempts have been made, to lessen
the Officers Fees, and all publick Dues, in Proportion to the
Quantity that was proposed to be lessened, of what was usually
made: This Attempt has always been without Effect, for
it is hard to find such a Medium as will be agreed on to be a
just Equivalent, but that either the Gentlemen who are in the
Publick Offices will think it too much lessens their Service, or
the Country, that they are too much augmented. This is
really a Difficulty hard to overcome; yet, if all Parties are
truly Patriots of their Country, as in Charity we ought to
<PB N="6" REF="002806_0005_0000000000000000">
take them to be, since all solemnly averr that the Publick
Good, is their first and chiefest View: If so, I say, it will not
be impossible or impracticable to get over it, as shall be de|monstrated
hereafter.</P>
<P>Having first try'd to find some such Law as may be a real
Service to our Country, and then well endeavoured to find
out that happy Expedient to reconcile such a Law to each Ones
Interest, <HI>Three</HI> Things seem absolutely necessary to obtain
this End. <HI>First,</HI> To ascertain a Time for Shipping off our
Tobacco. <HI>Secondly,</HI> To lessen the Quantity, and mend the
Quality of what shall be made in the Province. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To
oblige the Freighters to carry their Tobacco to the Ships in
which they send it.</P>
<P>The most effectual Way to accomplish these Ends would
be, <HI>First,</HI> For our Legislature to affix a certain Time, before
which, and another after which, none shall be Ship'd. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
To restrain every Taxable that works in Tobacco throughout
the Province, to a certain Number of <HI>Pounds. Thirdly,</HI> To
oblige every Freighter not only to rowl or carry his Tobacco
to his Landing, there to be Weighed and Stamped by the
proper Officer, but likewise to oblige him, after that is
done, to carry it to the Ship's Side in which he sends it;
the Master to pay him Five Shillings, or some certain Price,
for every Hogshead so delivered, and to be restrained from
fetching any himself, or receiving any without the proper
Stamp, under very severe Penalties.</P>
<P>A Law of this Nature would be attended with many Ad|vantages,
how difficult and surprizing soever it may seem at
first View. To demonstrate this, Let us consider some of
the necessary Consequences that will inevitably attend such a
Law, and the Conveniences and Advantages that will flow
from thence; and then, with the same Impartiality&punc; We'll
<PB N="7" REF="002806_0006_0000000000000000">
take a View of the Objections and Difficulties, that may be
made to it, or that it is liable to; whereby a Judgment may
be form'd whether it wou'd be for the Advantage of the
Country, or not: To proceed therefore in the Order proposed,
some of the natural Effects attending such a Law, seem evident.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The Merchants will know when to send their Ships,
and be at a Certainty how long they'll stay; at least, they'll be
sure that they cannot be detain'd longer than such a Time:
The Advantage the Country will receive from hence is very
obvious, for as their Ships are sure to be dispatch'd, they may
certainly afford to carry our Tobacco at easier Freights than
they now exact.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Consequence attending this Part of the Law is,
that our Tobacco will arrive at the <HI>European</HI> Markets at a
certain Time, after which the Merchants will be sure no more
can come that Season: From hence, this Advantage is apparent,
which will probably be a very considerable One, that they
can then keep up the Price to almost what they please, when
none of them can have any Advantage of another, in their
Expectation of more, before the usual Time in the ensuing Year;
it will then be out of their Power to circumvent each other
in a clandestine Way of sending and having their Ships return
at all Seasons of the Year, and keeping off the Buyers with an
Expectation of the Arrival of another Vessel with a good Load
of fresh Tobacco every Week or Fortnight; the Choice where|of
they are promised to have at an easy Rate. As it wou'd
prevent all this, so it wou'd be a Means to unite the Merchants,
which if it cou'd be effected, they might then have almost
what Price they wou'd for our Tobacco.</P>
<P>These are some of the Advantages that wou'd necessarily
attend the <HI>First</HI> Part of the Law: Let us now see the Conse|quences
of the</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002806_0007_0000000000000000">
<HI>Second.</HI> It's unnecessary to repeat what every Body is sen|sible
of, that the great Quantity of Tobacco made, and the
Badness of it's Quality, are the Occasions of the Smallness of
it's Value. This is allow'd by all; if so, can there be a more ef|fectual
Way to lessen the Quantity, and mend the Quality, then
by this Method of restraining the Taxables that work in that
Trade, to a certain Number of <HI>Pounds</HI> instead of Plants, which
the Country once design'd; for by this, as well as that Method,
the Quantity will be lessen'd; and it's apparent that this is a
much more effectual Way to mend the Quality: For when
the Planter is restrain'd to a Number of <HI>Pounds,</HI> he'll be sure
to make more than that Quantity, in Order to make so much
good; whereas by the other Method, we might be assur'd
every Leaf, tho' as bad as possible, wou'd be put up, so that
thereby neither the Quantity wou'd be much lessen'd, nor the
Quality amended, whereas this Method wou'd effectually an|swer
the End for which it is design'd, and then we may rea|sonably
Hope for all the Advantages which can be expected or
desir'd from the Value that is always set on any Commodity
that is both scarce and good.</P>
<P>Another Advantage that will attend this Law, is, that
when the Planter is so restrain'd to a certain Quantity of To|bacco,
he may have Leisure to employ some of his People and
his Time in making Inclosures, and raising good Stocks of all
kinds, Husbandry or some other Manufacture, so that his whole
Attention will not be upon making great Crops of Tobacco,
which, when made, are good for nothing&punc; The benefit of this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> manifested by our Neighbours of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> who go on all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint">&punc; and some little Manufactures of Hemp
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="faint"> they feed and cloath themselves comfort|bly
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> with their own Industry, which we might
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> do as they, and lay up most of the Produce of our
<PB N="9" REF="002806_0008_0000000000000000">
Tobacco, for a Provision for our Posterity; nay more, be able
to sell, and raise Money by our Provisions, Grain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence
it follows That we shou'd live much more comfortably,
and get more Money, which wou'd be an effectual Accom|plishment
of what we aim at.</P>
<P>There wou'd be this further Advantage in it, That the Mer|chants
by having an Account of the Number of our Taxables
that work in Tobacco, and by knowing how much each such
Taxable is allowed to make, wou'd know what Quantity of
Ships to send, which wou'd certainly be a great Ease to Trade.
It wou'd be a tedious Work to enumerate all the lesser Advan|tages
that wou'd attend such a Law, we will therefore con|tent
ourselves with these few Instances, that are most apparent
and most considerable, in the Two foregoing Parts of such a
Law, and proceed to consider those which evidently follow
the <HI>Third.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of these, is the great Ease and Dispatch it
will be to Ships, whereby they may, and certainly will go at
easier Freights than what we now give 'em, when the To|bacco
is thus brought to their Sides, and they are dispatch'd
in a very short Time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second,</HI> is the Quantity of Money this will bring into
the Province, when the Captain of each Ship is obliged to pay
so much as shall be thought proper, for each Hogshead, that
shall be carried on Board him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third,</HI> is the Quantity of Sloops, Flats and other Craft
that will then be employ'd by, and belonging to our Province,
which is an Advantage to a Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth,</HI> is the Number of those People that are now
Idlers, if not worse, that will then be employed and make it
their Business to carry those Persons Tobacco on Board, that
have not Conveniencies themselves of doing of it, for a small
Part of the Profit that is to be had for delivering it, as afore|said;
<PB N="10" REF="002806_0009_0000000000000000">
whereby they'll be taken off of their idle (and perhaps
Roguish) Way of Living, get a comfortable Subsistance, be
brought up Watermen or Sailors, and be render'd useful to
their Country: These are the most considerable Advantages
that at present accur, which will necessarily attend such a Law;
a little Experience might perhaps discover more, but these
are so manifest, and so very considerable, that surely they can
neither be deny'd nor slighted by any Lover of his Country,
when he makes serious Reflections hereon.</P>
<P>We'll now examine and consider the <HI>Objections,</HI> which
may be made hereunto, with the same Impartiality as we
have done the Advantages, and try if we cannot reconcile
them, or at least discover whether they are of such a malig|nant
Nature, or so pernicious a Consequence as to over-bal|lance
the Good and Benefits already demonstrated, as necessa|rily
attending such a Law. In Order to do this in the most
regular and clear Manner we can, we'll proceed in the
same Order as we did in the foregoing Part, and consider
the Objections which may be made to, as we did the Ad|vantages
that may arise from the Three Parts of this Law.</P>
<P>To the <HI>First</HI> Part, there cannot be any Manner of Objection
when a convenient Time for Shipping our off our Tobacco is
affix<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">d, unless that shou'd be too long a Time; if so, the Ships
wou'd be scattering one after another almost all the whole Year,
round as they are at present, and be continually coming to the
Market with fresh Loads of Tobacco, whereby the Evil this Part
is design'd to cure, wou'd remain; therefore the Consideration
of a proper Time, which will neither too much streighten the
Planter, nor give too much Latitude to him, or the Ships,
must be submitted to the Legislature, and is the only Thing
to be consider'd on this Part of such a Law.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002806_0010_0000000000000000">
But to the <HI>Second</HI> Part of this Law, whereby the Planter
is to be restrained to a certain Number of <HI>Pounds,</HI> many Ob|jections
may arise, which we'll put in the strongest Light
we are able, and consider their Force with the most sincere Im|partiality.
To proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>First.</HI> If the Quantity of Tobacco be much
lessen'd, his Lordship will be cut off of a great Part of his Reve|nue,
and it cannot be expected that he will agree to any such
Law, that will cause him to be so great a Sufferer.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The same Objection holds against a Number of
Plants as to a Number of <HI>Pounds,</HI> or against any other Me|thod
which lessens the Quantity; therefore there's no Doubt
but it's reasonable, that upon making any such Law, an Equi|valent
to his Lordship ought to be consider'd, of which the
Legislature are the best Judges, nor will the Author presume
to prescribe to them what wou'd be an Equivalent: But this
is manifest, from his Lordship's publick Spirit, and great Re|gard
that he has discovered in many Instances, for the Good of
the Country, even to the Prejudice of his Interest, that he
will not be very exact or hard to please in that Equivalent.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> This is not an equal Law, for To|bacco
is much more valuable in one Part of the Country than
another, so that the same Number of <HI>Pounds</HI> in those Parts are
of double or perhaps treble the Value they are of in others.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This appears to be one of the most forceable Ob|jections
that is, or can be urg'd against this Law; yet when
it is well consider'd, it has not that Difficulty which may be
apprehended, and will be found to proceed more from a ge|neral
ill-grounded Prepossession, than from any real Founda|tion;
for the Assertion is not true in Fact; and whatsoever
Notions may be entertained of the great Price which is gene|rally
given for Tobacco made in the Freshes of almost all the
<PB N="12" REF="002806_0011_0000000000000000">
Rivers of the Province on the light Lands, proceeds only from
a very few nice industrious Planters, who make a few Hog|sheads
in Proportion to their Crop of this fine Kite-Foot, or
Pale Yellow, Bright Tobacco, which fell high, and is noised
about the Country as the Price of their whole Crop; where|as
it is not perhaps the Fifth, or hardly the Tenth Part of
what they make, and their Neighbours have not more, or so
much by the Pound, as those in other Parts of the Country,
who make good Leaf, which is always made in these Parts,
where Colour is not aim'd at, and is really much the more cer|tain
Kind of Tobacco, and has for these Seven Years past, if
the Accounts of any considerable Quantity of both were to be
compar'd, sold higher by the Pound, than that light, ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">ffy
Tobacco, which the Planter has endeavoured to put up for
Colour; and by some small Accident, (which cannot be fore|seen
or prevented) it loosees that, and is then of no Value at
all, having neither Colour nor Substance, so that in reallity
the Leaf is the only certain valuable Tobacco: For, supposing
this light, chaffy Sort not to be of so precarious a Nature as it
is, and that a Quantity of it could be made, in that Case, the
Author of this Piece affirms, he has had it from some of the
most eminent Merchants in our Trade, that Twelve or Fif|teen
Hundred Hogsheads wou'd quite over do and glut all the
Markets in <HI>Europe,</HI> where that Sort is in Demand, and make it
a mere Drugg, of which he is perswaded many of the Legisla|ture
are sensible; so that he may justly conclude the Leaf To|bacco
to be the most certain kind, and most to be esteem'd:
Besides this, the strong Lands have unquestionably the Ad|vantage
of the light Soil in the Produce of Grain, or any other
Thing, which our Lands will be much employ'd in, if such
a Law be made. Upon the whole, when this is well consider'd,
it will appear to be as equal a Law as can be thought of, and
<PB N="13" REF="002806_0012_0000000000000000">
much more so than that which was design'd to restrain the
Taxables to a Number of Plants, which wou'd afford near
double the Number of <HI>Pounds</HI> on the strong Land, that they
wou'd yeild on the light Soil, and each of those <HI>Pounds</HI> are
already demonstrated to be as valuable, as the same Num|ber
of those where so many less in Quantity are made; so
that by such a Law, those Parts of the Country wou'd make
double the Profit by Tobacco, and have a better Soil to
out-do them as much in any other Commodity. Let it be
further consider'd, that the Poor generally live on the poor|est
Land, and if they were to be restrained to a certain Num|ber
of Plants which would, on such Lands, yield but a few
<HI>Pounds,</HI> they would always be kept poor; whereas by this
Method, they would be upon an Equality with others, in a
Prospect of amending their Condition by their Industry.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Third.</HI> It will be very difficult and expensive
to find out the Number of Pounds, which are made by each
Taxable</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> As to the Difficulty of doing this, it may easily
be removed, by appointing Two or Three Officers, (more or
less) as shall be adjudg'd convenient, in every Hundred, who
shall be sworn Officers to Weigh and Stamp each Freighters
Tobacco, and keep an exact Account of the Number and
Weight of each Man's Hogshead, and every Freighter obliged
on Oath, or under great Penalties, to declare what, and how
many Landings his Tobacco is Shipped off at; at which
Landing-Places, the proper Officer must Weigh and Stamp
his Tobacco, and the Master of the Ship be obliged not to
take it on Board, under very severe Penalties, without the
proper Stamp.</P>
<P>By this Means, it is only knowing the several Landings,
from which any Freighter ships his Tobacco, (which should
<PB N="14" REF="002806_0013_0000000000000000">
be Registred with the rest on a publick Record) examining
the several Officers Accounts that are appointed for those
Landings, to see how much he has Shipped from thence, and
comparing that with the Constables List of the Number of
his Taxables, to detect him if he has Transgressed the Law,
and in that case to destroy the Overplus, and fine him conside|rably,
if it appears to be a considerable or wilful Transgression.</P>
<P>But, as there will unavoidably be somethng over or un|der,
which will be occasioned by the Difference of Weights, a
Regard therefore ought to be had to that, and so much <HI>per
Cent.</HI> as shall be thought reasonable, allowed for it: Not
that so much more be allowed to be made, but where it comes
within that Allowance it should not be destroyed, but the
Planter charged with so much Shipped off that Year more
than his Number of <HI>Pounds,</HI> which must be deducted out of
his next Year's Crop; and so on the contrary, where he falls
short of his Quantity, to have Credit for the ensuing Year.</P>
<P>This is still to be understood, where it comes within so
much <HI>per Cent.</HI> as may be allowed, for if it exceeds that Al|lowance,
it is to be presumed a wilful Transgression, and it
ought to be destroyed. All this will not be near so trouble|some,
as the Method proposed in the Law, for ascertaining
a Number of Plants, where the Officers were to be obliged to
go into every Man's Field, and count the Number of his
Plants, in which be would be often deceived and imposed on:
And as to the Expence, as the Trouble is not so much, the
Charge cannot be more, and here is a Reward for delivering
our Tobacco will defray that Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Fourth.</HI> Still there will be a Difficulty of dis|covering
whether those Persons comply with the Law, who
lay out their Tobaco in the Country, and do not ship it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002806_0014_0000000000000000">
<HI>Answer.</HI> None at all, Let every Merchant who purchases
Tobacco, or every Sheriff who receives any from any Planter,
either be obliged to give an Account of what they received,
and of whom, to the proper Officer; or let such Tobacco
come to the Landings before it is Shipped off, with both the
Makers and present Proprietors Mark on it, whereby the Of|ficer
may easily know who made it, and charge him there|with
accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Fifth.</HI> What can the Planter do who is in|debted
to the Merchants and others, to comply with his
Engagements, when he is restrained from making enough to
do it?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> As to any Money-Engagements, it is intended to
raise Money sooner by this Method to comply there|with,
than to go on in the old Manner; but as to Tobacco
Debts, in which the Force of this Objection lies, there is no
greater Objection against this Method, than that of a Num|ber
of Plants, or any other Law, which can be thought of,
that would lessen the Quantity; and tho' it may be something
hard on such, yet when a general Good is obtained, tho' some
few particular Persons should suffer a small Inconvenience, it
must be submitted to; and if it were to be considered, that
these Debtors perhaps engaged themselves thus to the Mer|chants
several Years ago, at a Time when Tobacco was very
valuable, and he has lain a great while out of his Debt, it
will not appear any great Hardship, that the Debtor should
be obliged to discharge his just Debt, tho' with some Incon|venience
to him, when a Law has again raised the Value of
Tobacco to what it was when he contracted the Debt; tho',
I confess, there may be extraordinary Instances on this Occa|sion,
which will unavoidably attend any <HI>Tobacco-Law,</HI> which
lessens the Quantity. When such particular Instances appear,
<PB N="16" REF="002806_0015_0000000000000000">
it will become the Wisdom of the <HI>Legislature</HI> to take those
particular Cases under their Consideration, and give such Re|lief
therein as Justice requires, rather than loose a beneficial
Law, for some particular Cases it may be injurous to; for
there is scarce any advantageous Law, but some private Per|sons
are Sufferers by, yet a good Law for the General, ought
not to be lost on that Consideration.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Sixth.</HI> What will become of those Poor that
have not any Slaves, or other Taxables or Workers for them,
than their Wives and Children, and are obliged to lay out all
the Tobacco they can make in Stores, to clothe themselves
with, which it will scarce do, when they are restrained to
such a Quantity.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It is intended by, and expected from such a
Law, that the small Quantity they will then be permitted to
make, will be of more Value than the Whole they now
make, and they will have some spare Time, as well as others,
to do some other Thing for their Support; but if the <HI>Legi|slature</HI>
are of Opinion, that it will be hard on such, Let them
be allowed to make more than others, or even as much as
they can, provided they make it good, which will prevent
all Clamour of oppressing the Poor.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Seventh.</HI> If we lessen the Quantity of To|bacco,
and inhance its Value, our Neighbours of <HI>Pensilvania</HI>
will make it, and supply the Markets in <HI>Europe,</HI> so that
they will be as well stock'd as ever, and it will be as great
a Drugg.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> And must we go on in this Manner, and reduce
our selves, and our Posterity to Beggary and Misery, for fear
our Neighbours shou'd do so too&punc; Are we so fond of En|grossing
these Blessings to our selves? But we need not be
under these Apprehensions; for those who are in a Way of
<PB N="17" REF="002806_0016_0000000000000000">
subsisting themselves comfortably, will not be so willing to
exchange it for such a Prospect, as we imagine; nor is it so
easy for them to leave their old Way of Living to fall into
such a Trade as ours, which requires more Servants, Timber
and Expence, than they can well afford.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Eighth.</HI> Warehouses at so many Landings, to
hold all People's Tobacco, will be very burthensome, and a
vast Expence.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> A good, wholesome and advantageous Law, shou'd
not be lost for some Expence: But to reduce That, as much
as possible, reduce the Number of Landings as much as may
be, and a few large, rough Houses, at each of those Landings
will suffice to hold all the Tobacco that can be made: And
if the Publick will not be at the Expence of building such&punc;
let them lay a small Duty on each Hogshead, for the Benefit
of the Proprietor of those Houses; and give any one that will
build, Liberty to do so at those Landings, let it be on whose
Ground it will, only the Proprietor of the Land to have the
Preference of building such himself: By this Method, these
Houses will soon be erected, without any Expence to the
Publick.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Ninth.</HI> How will the Planters comply with
their Publick Dues, when the Quantity is so much lessen'd,
the Remainder will very little more than suffice to discharge
them, so that scarce any thing will remain to subsist them|selves
and Families upon?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The same may be said to this, as has been to
sundry of the former Objections, <HI>viz.</HI> That the same holds
good against any Law that lessens the Quantity of Tobacco;
but to be more particular in the Answer to this, and the fol|lowing
Objection will naturally lead us to comply with our
Promise in the Beginning. To reconcile this Law to the In|terest
<PB N="18" REF="002806_0017_0000000000000000">
of the Planter, and Country in general, and to those
who enjoy Publick Offices, and have large Publick Revenues:
By what has been already said, it seems evident, that such a
Law would be very advantageous to all concern'd in To|bacco;
but if this Objection be not remov'd, the Planter will
really be injur'd, for it is of no Advantage to him to raise the
Value of Tobacco to ever so great a Height, if he must make
but little and that little must go to discharge his Publick Dues.</P>
<P>The Country has already clipp'd and lessen'd the Officers
Fees so often, that it is to be apprehended they'll not agree,
nor is it perhaps equitable to dock them more: What re|mains
then to be done? The First Thing that appears neces|sary
in this Case, is, To consider the Nature of these Fees,
and the Services done for them, in the several Publick Offices
in the Province; and where the Fee is more valuable than
the Service for that particular Fee requires, there it ought to
be reduc'd, so as to render it adequate to the Service: And
altho' the Officers wou'd not agree to lessen their Fees promis|euously,
one Third, one Fourth, or any other Proportion,
which has always hitherto been the Method, whereby many
Fees which are already too small for the Service for which
they are perform'd, are reduc'd so much less, and others, per|haps,
not near enough reduc'd by that Proportion; yet I be|lieve,
none of them would refuse this Method of Entring into
the Method of the Services they do the Country, and consi|der
the Rewards that justly attend such Services; and if on
this Scrutiny, it be apparent in particular Instances, that the
Reward exceeds the Value of the Service, they would readily
agree to such a Reduction as might be reasonable: By this
Means a great Part of the publick Dues would be lessened,
and that with the Officers Content. When this is adjusted,
the next Thing to be considered, is, What a Proportion of
<PB N="19" REF="002806_0018_0000000000000000">
Tobacco usually made in the Province, may be lessen'd by this
Law: When that is agreed on, let the same proportionable
Part of all Publick Dues, be paid in <HI>Grain</HI> of any sort, Hemp,
Flax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at stated, fix'd Prices; which wou'd both be an Ease
to the Planter, and an Encouragement to go on those Sorts
of Manufactures.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Tenth.</HI> Still the remaining Part of our pub|lick
Dues will take away great Part of that little, we are
permitted to make, which we should be very unwilling to
part with, when it is the chiefest Thing we have to depend
on, to raise Money by; and if we would buy it of the Of|ficers,
they will hold it up at such an exorbitant Rate, that it
will take the Produce of what we make, to pay for it,
so that still we must either part with that little Tobacco we
make, or its full Value to the Officers.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It is to be hoped, when such a Reduction of the
Officers Fees, as was proposed in the foregoing Answer, is
made, and such a Proportion of them that are allowed,
and all other publick Dues, are to be paid in the Manner there
proposed, that the remaining Part will not be so burthen|some
to the Country: However, if it appears to be so, the
<HI>Legislature</HI> may settle all publick Dues of what Nature so|ever,
at a certain fixed Rate in Money, to be paid to the
Sheriff of each County, by such a Day, if the Debtor
pleases; so that it may be left to his Choice to pay the Mo|ney
or Tobacco. If this Method be agreed on, it solves all
the Objections I can think of, that can arise on the <HI>Second</HI>
Part of this Law, reconciles the Interest of the Officer and
Planter together&punc; and will certainly render it very advanta|geous
to the whole Province.</P>
<P>We will now take a View of the Objections that may be
made against the <HI>Third</HI> Part of such a Law (wherein the
<PB N="20" REF="002806_0019_0000000000000000">
Freighter would be obliged to carry his Tobacco to the
Ship's Side in which he sends it) which are but Two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>First.</HI> The Difficulty of rowling many Peo|ples
Tobacco, and after that is done, carrying it to the Ship's
Side, is so great, that the poor, middling, and even many of
the better sort of Planters, that have not Convenience for
either, will be under great Hardships to comply with it.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> As they are to be paid for every Hogshead so
delivered, it will be a sufficient Reward for the Trouble they
are at, who undertake to do it themselves: And, for such
as will not undertake it, there will be enough, both by Land
and Water, who will then make it their Business to do it for
Hire, who may be employed to carry it on Board, for much
less than the Reward which will be received, for delivering it.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> The Merchants, Owners of the Ships,
and Masters, will not agree to give so much Money for each
Hogshead brought on Board; and it will be a Barthen on
Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It will be quite otherwise, it will be an Ease to
Trade, and all that are concerned, will willingly pay that
Money, when they are to be at no further Charge for Craft;
when Rowling (a Work not fit for Men) is over, and when
they'll meet with so great Dispatch it will manifestly be very
advantageous to them, and a great Ease to Trade in general.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone thro', and considered the Consequences
of such a Law; I have shown several considerable Advantages,
that will attend it, have also (as I persuade my self) recon|ciled
the Objections that may be made to it; have likewise
reconciled it (I hope) to the Interest both of the Officer, and
Planter, and demonstrated it to be an Ease to Trade: So
that all Parties concerned, will find their Advantage in it;
Yet, I am not so fond of my own Performance, as to think
<PB N="21" REF="002806_0020_0000000000000000">
it uncapable of Amendment; on the contrary, I am sensible
that few such Projections are perfect at first Attempt: It
would therefore be of Service to the Country, if any Gentle|man
discovers any Defect herein, or can form a more ad|vantageous
Scheme, that he would with the same Freedom
communicate his Thoughts to the Publick, and correct what
may be a miss here; which would be so far from giving any
Resentment to the Author of this Piece, that on the contrary,
he desires it, and would be thankful to them, and willingly
submit to any real Amendment which can be proposed: And,
as he does not doubt your Readiness to Publish these Thoughts,
so he is persuaded, you will, with the same Readiness, make
Publick those of another, on the same Occasion; whereby the
Country may perhaps receive some Benefit, which is the only
View of a Well-Wisher to it, And</P>
