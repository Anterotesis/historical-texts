<P>No Brother God forbid, I am not
an idle Spectator, nor am I ignorant of the

did not know but you might inform me of
something that's new, or advise with me what
is further to be done, for my Part you can|not
entertain any doubt but agreeable to my
Forefathers <HI>Oliverian</HI> Spirit, I would freely
Sacrifice my Life and Fortune for this Cause,
rather than those Misecrants of the Establish'd
Church of <HI>England,</HI> or those R&mdash;ls the
Q&mdash;s, should continue longer at the head
of Government, it vexes me to the Soul to
see those heathen Enemies. openly Protected

<P>Sir, I am glad to see you, how do you
do, are you not well, you look a little discompos'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay well I may&mdash;no wonder, I have been
much flustrated, I have been Ill treated by my
Neighbour P&mdash;I never took him to be the
Man I now find he is.</P>

<P>Why Sir, I hope he has not treated you ill.</P>
</SP>

<P>Worse than I ever was treated, by any
one I'm sure, worse than ever I was treated in my life.</P>

<P>I am very sorry for it indeed, perhaps
he was only joking.</P>

<P>No no, it was a true joke.</P>

<P>You astonish me, but 'tis best as it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Qua.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has gone so far in it and spoke so much
in their favour, that I think it, is little better than
Treason&punc; I am sure the Law could take hold of him
for it; and I think I shall not be satisfy'd untill I
have made a proper Report of the Matter, when
these present Disturbances are a little settled.</P>

any dislike to the King, or the Government, but
from a Religious scruple of Conscience in bearing
