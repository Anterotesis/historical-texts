<P>P<HI>Ennsylvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jersy</HI> in <HI>America</HI> lieth in about forty &amp; forty two Degrees of North Latitude, and is severed the one from the other by the River of <HI>Dela|ware</HI> on the West, and seperated from <HI>New-York</HI> Collony by <HI>Sandy-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-Bay,</HI> and part of <HI>Hudsons</HI> River on the East. The dayes in the Winter are about two hours longer, and in the Summer two hours shorter than in <HI>England,</HI> the Sum|mer somewhat hotter, which causeth the Fruits and Corn somewhat to ripen faster than in <HI>England,</HI> and the Harvest for <HI>Wheat, Rye</HI> and <HI>Barley,</HI> being about the latter end of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. In the Winter season it is cold and freezing Weather, and sometimes Snow, but commonly very clear and Sun-shine, which soon dissolves it.</P>
<P>The Country is well Watered, the River of <HI>Delaware</HI> be|ing navigable for Ships of great burthen to <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rlington,</HI> which from the <HI>Capes,</HI> or entrance, is accounted an hundred and forty Miles; and for Sloops to the Falls, which is about ten Miles farther.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Sandy-hoock</HI> on <HI>East-Jersy</HI> is a safe and excel|lent Harbour for any Fleet of Ships, which can lie there in all Weathers, and go in and out to Sea in Winter, as well as Summer, and Ships of great Burthen can lie close to the Town of <HI>New-Perth;</HI> which renders it a good Scituation for Navigation, from whence in six Hours time at most, Ships can go out into the Sea; and close by the Town of <HI>Perth</HI> runs up <HI>Rariton</HI> River. From the Falls of <HI>Delaware</HI> River the <HI>Indians</HI> go in Cannows up the said River, to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town called <HI>Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sincks,</HI> which is accounted from the Falls about eighty Miles; but this they perform by great Labour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in setting up against the Stream; but they can come down
<PB N="4" REF="000386_0004_0FA556D139EB7808">
with ease and speed; the River from the Falls runs from the North and North-West about twenty Miles, as I my self observed in my Travel so far by the River, but by the <HI>In|dians</HI> Information, it cometh about more Easterly farther up. I have been informed, that about <HI>Minisincks,</HI> by the River|side, both in <HI>New-Jersey</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> is great quantities of exceeding rich open Land, which is occasioned by wash|ing down of the Leaves and Soil in great Rains from the Mountains, which Land is exceeding good, for the raising of <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax, Wheat,</HI> or any other sorts of Corn, Fruits, Roots &amp;<HI>c.</HI> Where in time may be conveniently settled a Manufacture for the making of <HI>Linnen-Cloth, Cordage, Twine, Sacking, Fishing-Nets,</HI> and all other commodities commonly made of Hemp or Flax: And after great Rains, we may bring down great quantities of Goods in flat-bottom-Boats, built for that purpose, which will then come down, by rea|son of the Land-floods with speed.</P>
<P>And into this River, betwixt the Capes and the Falls, run many navigable Rivers and Cricks, some of them fifteen or twenty Miles, and others less, which Rivers and Cricks are made by the plenty of Springs and Brooks, that run out of the Country, many of which Brooks are so considerable, as to be fit to drive Mills. And above the falls, in travelling of twenty Miles by the Rivers side, I went over twenty run|nings of Water, five or six of them being fit to build Mills on.</P>
<P>The Country for the most part is pretty leavel, until we come about ten Miles above the Falls, where it is Mounta|nious for many Miles, but interlaced with fertile Valleys. The Bay and River of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and the Rivers and Cricks that runs into it, are plentifully stored with various sorts of good <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Water-Fowl,</HI> as <HI>Swans, Geese, Ducks, Wigeons,</HI> &amp;c. And a considerable <HI>Whale</HI>-Fishery may be carried on in
<PB N="5" REF="000386_0005_0FA556D21D8D0870">
the Bay of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and on the Sea-Coasts of <HI>New Jersey,</HI> there being <HI>Whale</HI>-Fisheries already begun, plenty of <HI>Whales</HI> being by experience found there, and the Winter-time being the time for the catching them, they will not thereby be hin|dred of raising there Summer-Crops; and the Oyl and Bone being good Commodities to be sent for <HI>England,</HI> there also be|ing in the Bay of <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Sandy-hoock, Drums, Sheeps-heads Bass,</HI> and other sorts of large Fish, which may be fit to salt up in Casks to keep for use, and Transportation also. There are great plenty of <HI>Oysters,</HI> which may be pickled and put up in small Casks for use. Likewise, on <HI>Delaware</HI> River are great plenty of <HI>Sturgion,</HI> which doubtless might be a good Trade, if mannaged by such Persons as are skilful in the boyling and pickling of them, so as to preserve them good to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and other adjacent Islands. There are also in the Springs great quantities of a sort of Fish like <HI>Herrings:</HI> with plenty of the Fish called <HI>Shads,</HI> but not like the <HI>Shads</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> but of another kind, being a much better sort of Fish; the Inhabitants usually catch quantities, which they salt up, and pack them in Barrels for Winter's Provi|sion.</P>
<P>The Lands from the Capes, to about six Miles above <HI>New|Castle</HI> (which is by estimation ninety Miles) is for the most part very rich, there being very many navigable Cricks on both sides of the River, and on the River and Cricks are great quantities of rich fat Marsh Land, which causeth those parts, to some fresh People, to be some what unhealthful in the latter part of the Summer, at which time some of them have <HI>Agues:</HI> Also in and near these Marshes, are small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, cal|led <HI>Musketoes,</HI> which are troublesome to such People as are not used to them; but were those Marshes banked, and drained, and then plowed and sowed, some Years with Corn, and then with <HI>English</HI> Hay-seed, I do suppose it
<PB N="6" REF="000386_0006_0FA556D2C7E7FCA0">
would be healthful, and very little troubled with <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sketoes;</HI> and if Cattel did commonly feed on this Ground, and tread it as in <HI>England,</HI> I suppose it would not be inferior to the rich Meadows on the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> and were quantities of this Land laid dry, and brought into Tillage, I suppose it would bear great Crops of <HI>Wheat, Pease</HI> and <HI>Barley, Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax,</HI> and it would be very fit for <HI>Hop-Gardens,</HI> and for <HI>English</HI> Grass, which might serve for rich Pastures or Mea|dow. Also these Marshes are fit for <HI>Rape,</HI> and were <HI>Rape</HI>|Mills built, and the design mannaged, so as it would be if it were in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> a great Trade might be carried on, and many hundred Tuns of <HI>Rape-</HI>Oyl might be made Yearly, and sent to <HI>England,</HI> to the Planters inrichment; and not only so, but would be for Merchants advantage, they thereby having Goods to freight their Ships, which would tend to the benefit of the Inhabitants in general.</P>
<P>And if those Trades and Designs are carried on to effect, as are mentioned in this Treatise, there would naturally follow Trade and Imployment for <HI>Ship-wrights, Boat-wrights, Coopers, Carpenters, Smiths, Ropers, Mariners, Weavers, Butchers, Bakers, Brewers;</HI> and many other sorts of Trades would have full Impoyment.</P>
<P>From six Miles above <HI>New-Castle</HI> to the Falls of <HI>Delaware</HI> (which is about sixty Miles) and so to the Head of the said River, the <HI>Water</HI> is clear, fresh, and fit for Brewing, or any other use.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> clear and good, it being supposed to be as health|ful as any part of <HI>England</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Land</HI> is in Veins, some good, and some bad, but the greatest part will bear good Corn, as <HI>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Indian Corn, Buck-Wheat, Pease</HI> and <HI>Indian Beans,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fruits that grow natural in the Countries are <HI>Strawberries, Cramberries, Huckleberries, Blackberries, Medlers, Grapes,
<PB N="7" REF="000386_0007_0FA556D3927528A0">
Plums, Hickery-Nuts, Walnuts, Mulberies, Chestnuts, Hass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|nuts,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Orchards of <HI>Apples, Pears, Quinces, Peaches, Aprecocks, Plums, Cheries,</HI> and other sorts of the usual Fruits of <HI>England</HI> may be soon raised to good advantage, the Trees growing faster then in <HI>England,</HI> whereof great quantities of <HI>Sider</HI> may be made. And were Glass-houses erected to furnish us with Bottles, we might have a profitable Trade, by sending <HI>Sider</HI> to <HI>Jamaico</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. ready bottled, which is commonly so sent from <HI>Herefordshire</HI> to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It is supposed that we may make as good Wines as in <HI>France,</HI> (if Vineyards were planted on the sides of Hills or Banks, which are defended from the cold North-West Winds) with such Vines as the <HI>French</HI>-men commonly make those Wines of; for the Climate is as proper as any part of <HI>France,</HI> therefore it is rational to believe, that the Wines will be as rich and good as in <HI>France.</HI> There are some Vine|yards already planted in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and more intended to be planted by some <HI>French-Protestants,</HI> and others, that are gone to settle there.</P>
<P>Several other Commodities may be raised here, as <HI>Rice,</HI> which is known to have been sown for a tryal, and it grew very well, and yielded good encrease.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Annis-Seeds</HI> I have been informed groweth well, and might be a profitable Commodity, there being great Quan|tities used in <HI>England</HI> by Distillers.</P>
<P><HI>Liquorish</HI> doubtless would grow very well. And I que|stion

not but that <HI>Mather, Woad,</HI> and other Plants and Roots for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> use might be raised. <HI>Shuemack</HI> groweth natural|ly. Also several useful Durgs grow naturally, as <HI>Sassafrass, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Callamus Aromaticus, Snake-Root, Jallappa,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pine-Tree</HI> groweth here, out of which is made <HI>Pitch, Tar, Rosin</HI> and <HI>Turpentine:</HI> In <HI>New-England</HI> some make quantities of <HI>Tar</HI> out of the Knots of <HI>Pine Trees,</HI> with which they supply themselves and others.</P>
<P>There are many other sorts of <HI>Plants, Roots</HI> and <HI>Herbs</HI> of great Virtue, which grow here, which are found to cure such Distempers as the People are insident to.</P>
<P><HI>Hops</HI> in some places grow naturally, but were <HI>Hop</HI>-Gar|dens planted in low rich Land, quantities might be raised to good advantage.</P>
<P>There is no <HI>Lime Stone</HI> as we yet know of, but we make <HI>Lime</HI> of <HI>Oyster</HI> Shels, which by the Sea and Bay side are so plentiful, that we may load Ships with them.</P>
<P>There are several sorts of good <HI>Clay,</HI> of which Bricks, Earthen-Ware, and Tobacco-Pipes are made; and in some places there are Quaries of a ruf hard Stone, which are good to wall Cellars, and some Stone fit for Pavement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trees</HI> grow but thin in most places, and very little under-Wood. In the <HI>Woods</HI> groweth plentifully a course sorts of <HI>Grass,</HI> which is so proving that it soon makes the Cattel and Horses fat in the Summer, but the <HI>Hay</HI> being course, which is chiefly gotten on the fresh Marshes, the Cattel loseth their Flesh in Winter, and become very poor, except we give them Corn: But this may be remydied in time, by draining of low rich Land, and by plowing of it and sowing it with <HI>English</HI>-Grass-seed, which here thrives very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hogs</HI> are fat in the Woods when it is a good Mast-Year.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000386_0009_0FA556D50D7AB2E8">The Woods are furnished with store of Wild Fowl, as <HI>Turkeys, Phesants, Heath-Cocks, Partridges, Pidgeons, Black|birds,</HI> &amp; And People that will take the pains to raise the various sorts of same Fowl, may do it with as little trouble, and less charge, then they can in <HI>England,</HI> by reason of what they find in the Woods.</P>
<P><HI>Bees</HI> are found by the experience of several that keep them, to thrive very well.</P>
<P>I do not question but that we might make good strong found <HI>Beer, Ale</HI> and <HI>Mum,</HI> that would keep well to <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> the Water being good, and <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Barley</HI> in a few Years like to be very plentiful: Great quantities of <HI>Beer, Ale</HI> and <HI>Mum</HI> is sent yearly from <HI>London,</HI> and other places, to <HI>Bar|badoes, Jamaica,</HI> and other Islands in <HI>America,</HI> where it fells to good advantage; and if <HI>Beer, Ale</HI> and <HI>Mum</HI> hold good from <HI>England</HI> to those places, which 'tis said is above one thousand Leagues; I question not but if it be well brewed in a sea|sonable time of the Year, and put up in good Casks, but it will keep good to be Transported from <HI>Delaware</HI> River to those Islands aforesaid, which by computation, is not above half so far. If Merchants can gain by sending <HI>Beer, Ale</HI> and <HI>Mum</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> where Corn is dear, and Freight dear, by reason of the length of the Voyage, we in all probability must get much more, that buy our Corn cheap, and pay less Freight.</P>
<P><HI>Flower</HI> and <HI>Bisket</HI> may be made in great quantities in a few Years, the Wheat being very good, which seldom fails of finding a good Market at <HI>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Islands: great quantities are sent yearly from <HI>Lon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> and other places, which if they can make Profit of it, we much more for the Reasons already given.</P>
<P><HI>Pork</HI> is but about half the price as in <HI>England,</HI> therefore the Inhabitants will seldom have their Market spoiled by
<PB N="10" REF="000386_0010_0FA556D5B56E5C28">
any that come from <HI>England,</HI> of which Commodity the In|habitants in a few Years will have Quantities to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell to the Merchant, which is salted, and packed in Barrels, and so trans|ported to <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Nevis,</HI> and other Islands. Hams of <HI>Bacon</HI> are also made, much after the same manner as in <HI>West-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alia</HI> and the Bacon eats much like it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Beef</HI> in the Fall is very fat and good, and we are like|ly in a few years to have great Plenty, which will serve our Families, and furnish Shipping.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Mutton</HI> is also fat, found and good, being only fed with natural Grass; but if we sprinkle but a little <HI>English</HI> Hay-Seed on the Land without Plowing, and then feed Sheep on it, in a little time it will so encrease, that it will cover the Land with <HI>English</HI> Grass, like unto our Pastures in <HI>England,</HI> provided the Land be good. We find the Profits of Sheep are considerable.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Butter</HI> is very good, and our <HI>Cheese</HI> is indifferent good, but when we have Pastures of <HI>English</HI> Gass, (which many are getting into) then I suppose our <HI>Cheese</HI> will be as good as that of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Horses</HI> are good serviceable Horses, fit both for Draught and Saddle, the Planters will ride them fifty Miles a day, without Shoes, and some of them are indifferent good shapes; of which many Ships are freighted yearly from <HI>New|England</HI> with Horses to <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis,</HI> and other places; and some Ships have also been freighted out of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey</HI> with Horses to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but if we had some choice Horses from <HI>England,</HI> and did get some of the best of our Mares, and keep them well in the Winter, and in Pa|stures inclosed in the Summer, to prevent there going a|mongst other Horses, we might then have a choice breed of Horses, which would tend much to the advantage of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000386_0011_0FA556D6BB277E60">The Commodities fit to send to <HI>England,</HI> besides wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> are already named, are the Skins of the several wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that are in the Country, as <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Deer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Fisher, Bear, Fox, Rackoon, Marten, Otter, Woolf, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">skquash, Mink, Cat,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Also <HI>Iron</HI> may be here made, there being one <HI>Iron-</HI>Work already in East-<HI>Jersey.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise, we may furnish Merchants with Pipe-Staves, and other Coopers Timber and Hoops.</P>
<P>The <HI>Woolen</HI> Manufacture may be mannaged in<HI>Pennsyl|vania</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> to good advantage, the upper parts of the Country being very fit for the keeping of Sheep, the Wool being found to good, and the Sheep not subject to the <HI>Rot:</HI> The Ewes commonly after the first time, bring two Lambs at once.</P>
<P>But it may be queried, <HI>How shall the Sheep be preserved from the Woolf?</HI></P>
<P>I answer; Get such a Flock as it may answer the charge, for a boy to make it his full Employment to look after them, and let them be pend at Night in a House or Fold provided for that purpose. If one man have not enough to imploy a Shepherd, then let several joyn their Stock together.</P>
<P>But it may be queried, <HI>Where shall Wool be gotten to carry on the Woollen Manufacture, untill we have of our own raising?</HI></P>
<P>I answer; in <HI>Road Island,</HI> and some other adjacent Islands and Places, Wool may be bought at six Pence a Pound, and considerable Quantities may be there had, which will sup|ply until we can raise enough of our own.</P>
<P>Also, we may have <HI>Cotton-Wool</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and other adjacent Islands in returns for our Provisions that we send them. So that the making of Cotton-Cloth and Fustians
<PB N="12" REF="000386_0012_0FA556D837F53DB8">
may be likewise made to good advantage, the <HI>Cotten-Wool</HI> being purchased by the growth of our own Country; and the Linnen-Yarn being spun by our own Families, of <HI>Flax,</HI> of our own growth and ordering.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tanning-</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rade and <HI>Sho-making</HI> may be here man|naged to good advantage, <HI>Hides</HI> being plenty, and to be had at moderate Prices, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ark</HI> to be had for only the charge in getting it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Skinner</HI> that can dress Skins in Oyl, may do very well; for we have <HI>Elk</HI> skins, and plenty of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uck</HI> and <HI>Doe</HI> skins, which the Inhabitants give (at <HI>New York,</HI> where there are such Trades) one half for dressing the other.</P>
<P>There ought to be <HI>publick Store - Houses</HI> provided for all Persons to bring their Flax, Hemp and Linnen Cloth to, where it may be preserved clean and dry at a very small Charge, and the owner at liberty to take it out at his own will and plea|sure, or to fell, transfer or assign it to any other. Now the Hemp, Flax and Linnen Cloth being brought into the publick Store-House, and the Quantity, Quality and Value of it there registred in the Book, to be kept for that purpose; and the Person that hath put in the said Hemp, Flax and Linnen Cloth, taking a Note under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and and Seal, from the Store-house Register, of the quantity, quality and value of the Hemp Flax, and Linnen Cloth brought into the publick Store-House, with the time it was delivered; these Notes will pass from one man to another all one as Money: <HI>As for Example,</HI> Suppose I am a Merchant, that am furnished with divers sorts of goods, I fell them to a Planter, and receive their Notes which they had from the Store-house <HI>Registry,</HI> in pay for my goods, to the value of one hundred Pounds. I buy of the Clothier in Woolen Cloth to the value of sixty pounds, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oper in Cordage to the value of forty pounds; I pay them by these Notes on the Store-house; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lother he buys Woolen Yarn

The Roper, when he pleaseth, receives on demand, in Hemp to the value of forty pounds out of the publick Store, by which he is made capable of imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ying his Servants in making of Cordage; but he that hath no occasion to take out this Hemp or Flax, or Linnen Cloth, may pass these Notes from one man to another, as often they please, which is all one as ready Money at all times.</P>

<P><PB N="34" REF="000386_0034_0FA55720B499F140">Some are apt to ask, How we can propose safely to live amongst such a Heathen People as the Indians, whose Prin|ciples and Practices leads them to War and Bloodshed, and our Principles and Practices leading us to love Enemies, and if reviled, not to revile again; and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mitten on the one cheek to turn the other, and we being a peaceable People, whose Principles and Practices are against Wars and Fightings?</P>
<P><HI>I Answer:</HI> That we settled by the Indians consent and good liking, and bought the Land of them, that we settle on, which they conveyed to us by Deed under their Hands and Seals, and also submitted to several Articles of agreement with us, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> not to do us any Injury; but if it should so happen, that any of their People at any time should injure or do harm to any of us, then they to make us satisfaction for the Injury done; therefore if they break these Covenants and Agreements, then they may be proceeded against as other Offendors, <HI>6<ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> to be kept in subjection to the Magi|strates Power, in whose hand the Sword of Justice is com|mitted to be used by him, for the punishment of Evil-doers, and praise of them that do well; therefore I do believe it to be both lawful and expedient to bring Offendors to justice by the power of the Magistrates Sword, which is not to be used in vain, but may be used against such as raise Rebellions and Insurrections against the Government of the Country, be they <HI>Indians</HI> or others, otherwise it is in vain for us to pretend to Magistracy or Government, it being that which we own to be lawful both in Principle and Practice.</P>

<P>Q. Whether there be not Snakes, more especially the Rattle-Snake?</P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> Yes, but not many Rattle-Snakes, and they are easily discovered; for they commonly lie in the Paths for the benefit of the sun, &amp; if any Person draws nigh them, they shake their Tail, on which the Rattles grow, which make a noise like a childs Rattle; I never heard of but one Person bitten in <HI>Penn|silvania</HI> or <HI>New-Jersey</HI> with the Rattle-Snake, and he was help of it lay live Chickens slit assunder and apply'd to the place, which drew out the Poyson; and as to the other Snake, the most plentiful is a black Snake, its bite, 'tis said, does no more harm than the prick of a Pin.</P>
<P>I have mentioned before, that there are a sort of troublesom Files call'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (much like the Gnats in <HI>England</HI>) in the lower parts of the country, where the great Marshes are, but in the upper parts of the Country seldom one is seen.</P>
<P>There are Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Back-birds, which may be accounted amongst the inconveniences, they being destructive to the <HI>In|dian Corn,</HI> the Crows by picking up the Corn just as its appear|ing in the blade above ground, and the Black-birds by eating it in the Year, before it be full hard, if not prevented by look|ing after; but other sorts of Corn they seldom hurt.</P>
<P>It is rational to believe, that all considerate Persons will sit down and count the cost before they begin to build; for they must expect to pass through a Winter before a Summer, but not so troublesom a Winter as many have imagined; for those that come there to settle now, may purchase Corn, Cattel,

and other things at the prices mentioned, and may have Houses in some of the Towns of <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jesey</HI> on Rent, until they build for themselves, and Water-Mills to grind their Corn, which are such conveniences that we that went first partly missed of.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter by Thomas Budd, sent to his Friends in Pennsilvania and New-Jersey.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOu are often in my Remembrance, and at this time I feel the tender Bowels of our heavenly Father's Love flowing in my Heart towards you, in a fence of those great Exercises that many of you have, do and may meet withal in your <HI>Spiritual Travel towards</HI> the <HI>Land of Promise.</HI></P>
<P>I am also sensible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the many <HI>Exercises</HI> and inward <HI>Com|bats</HI> that many of you met withal, after you felt an inclina|tion in your Hearts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your selves into <HI>America:</HI> Oh the <HI>Breathing</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Prayers,</HI> and earnest <HI>Desires</HI> that were in your Hearts to the Lord, <HI>That you might not go except it was his good Pleasure to remove you, for a purpose of his own:</HI> This you earnestly desired to be satisfied in, and many of you received satisfaction, that it was your places to leave your Native Country, Trades, and near and dear Relations and Friends to transplant your selves into a Wilderness, where you expected to meet with many Tryals and Exer|cises of a differing kind, than what you had met withal in your Native Country; but this you contentedly gave up to, but not without earnest desire, and fervent Prayers to the Lord for his Wisdom to govern you, and his Fatherly Care to preserve you, and his comfortable presence to be with you, to strengthen and enable you chearfuly to undergo those new and unaccustomed Tryals and Exercises, that you were sen|sible would attend you in this weighty undertaking the Lord heard your Prayers, and answered your Desires, inasmuch as that his Fatherly Care was over yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and his living P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence

did accompany you over the great Deep; so that you saw his wonderful Deliverence, and in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence thereof, you prai|sed his Name for the same.</P>
<P>The Lord having thus far answered our Souls desire, as to bring us to our desired Port in safety, and to remain with us, to be a Counsellor of good things unto us, let us now an|swer this Kindness unto us by a <HI>righteous Conversation,</HI> and a <HI>pure, holy</HI> and <HI>innocent Life,</HI> that others beholding the same, may be convinced thereby, and may glorifie our heavenly Father.</P>
<P>The Eyes of many are on us, some for Good, and some for Evil; therefore my earnest Prayers are to the Lord, That he would preserve us, and give us <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that we may be governed aright before him, and that he would give a good Understanding to those that are in Authority amongst us, that his Law may go forth of <HI>Sion,</HI> and his Word from <HI>Jerusa|lem</HI> Be not backward in discharging that great Trust com|mitted to you in your respective Offices and Places, that you may be help-meets in the Restroration.</P>
<P>And be careful to suppress, and keep down all Vice, and disorderly Spirits, and incourage Virtue, not only in the general, but every one in his perticular Family; there is an incumbant Duty lieth on all Masters of Families over their Family, therefore my desire is, that we may call our Fami|lies together at convenient times and Seasons, to wait upon the Lord, and to seek to him for <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Counsel,</HI> that his Blessings may attend us and our Families, and our Chil|dren may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about our Table as Olive-branches full of Virtue, then shall we be full of Joy and Peace, and living Praises will spring to the Lord, in that his Blessings and Fatherly Care hath been thus continued towards us.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Friends;</HI> be tender and helpful one towards another, that the Lord may bless and fill you with his divine Love,
<PB N="39" REF="000386_0039_0FA5572A0801B2A8">
and sweet refreshing Life, which unities our Souls to each other, and makes us as one Family of Love together: Let us not entertain any hard Thoughts one of another, but if difference should happen amongst us, let a speedy and peace|able end be put unto it; for if Prejudices enter, it will eat out the precious Life, and make us barren and unfruitful to God. We are not without our daily Exercises, Tryals and Temptations, therefore do desire the Lord may put it into your Hearts, to Pray for our Preservation, and our safe re|turn to you, that we may meet together again in the same overcoming Love of God, in which we parted from you.</P>
<P>My Heart is full of Love to you, and do long to see your Faces, and to enjoy your Company, that I may more fully express that pure Love of God that Springs in my Heart unto you, then I can do by Writing. Therefore I desire you may rest satisfied with these few Lines, and receive them as a token of unfeigned Love. From</P>
