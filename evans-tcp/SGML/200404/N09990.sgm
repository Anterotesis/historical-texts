<P>We still retain a Disposition to do all in our Power to give Satisfaction to the Town, but as we under|stood from you and the other Gentlemen Selectmen at Mess. Clarkes Interview with you last Saturday, that this can be effected by nothing less than our send|ing back the Teas, we beg Leave to say, that this is utterly out of our Power to do, but we do now declare to you our Readiness to Store the Teas until we shall have Opportunity of writing to our Constituents and shall receive their further Orders respecting them; and we do most sincerely wish that the Town consi|dering the unexpected Difficulties devolved upon us will be satisfied with what we now offer.</P>
<CLOSER>We are,<SALUTE> SIR,</SALUTE> Your most humble Servants, <SIGNED><HI>Tho.</HI> &amp; <HI>Elisha Hutchinson,</HI></SIGNED>

<P>And the same being read by the Sheriff, there was immediately after, a loud and very general Hiss.</P>
<P>A Motion was then made, and the Question put, Whether the Assembly would disperse and surcease all further Proceedings, according to the Gover|nor's Requirement&mdash;It pass'd in the Negative, nem. con.</P>
<P>A Proposal of Mr. Copley was made, that in Case he could prevail with the Mess. Clarkes to come into this Meeting, the Question might now be put, Whether they should be treated with Civi|lity while in the Meeting, though they might be of different Sentiments with this Body; and their Persons be safe until their Return to the Place from whence they should come&mdash;And the Ques|stion being accordingly put, passed in the Affirma|tive, Nem. Con.</P>
<P>Another Motion of Mr. Copley's was put, Whether two Hours shall be given him, which also passed in the Affirmative.</P>
<P>Adjourn'd to Two o'Clock, P. M.</P>
<P>TWO o'Clock P. M. met according to Ad|journment.</P>
<P>A Motion was made and passed, that Mr. Rotch and Capt. Hall be desired to give their Attendance.</P>
<P>Mr. Rotch appeared, and upon a Motion made the Question was put, Whether it is the firm Resolution of this Body, that the Tea brought by Capt. Hall shall be returned by Mr. Rotch to England in the Bottom in which it came; and whether they accordingly now require the same, which passed in the Affirmative, Nem. Con.</P>
<P>Mr. Rotch then informed the Meeting that he should protest against the whole Proceedings as he had done against the Proceedings on Yesterday, but that tho' the returning the Tea is an invo|luntary Act in him, he yet considers himself as under a Necessity to do it, and shall therefore com|ply with the Requirement of this Body.</P>
<P>Capt. Hall being present was forbid to aid or assist in unloading the Tea at his Peril, and ordered that if he continues Master of the Vessel, he carry the same back to London; who reply'd he should comply with these Requirements.</P>
<P>Upon a Motion, Resolved, That John Rowe, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Owner of Part of Capt. Bruce's Ship expected with Tea, as also Mr. Timmins, Factor for Capt. Coffin's Brig, be desired to attend.</P>
<P>Mr. Ezekiel Cheever was appointed Captain of the Watch for this Night, and a sufficient Number of Volunteers gave in their Names for that Service.</P>
<P>VOTED, That the Captain of this Watch be desired to make out a List of the Watch for the next Night, and so each Captain of the Watch for the following Nights until the Vessels leave the Harbour.</P>
<P>Upon a Motion made, Voted, that in Case it should happen that the Watch should be any Ways molested in the Night, while on Duty, they give the Alarm to the Inhabitants by the tolling of the Bells&mdash;and that if any Thing happens in the Day Time, the Alarm be by ringing of the Bells.</P>
<P>VOTED, That six Persons be appointed to be in Readiness to give due Notice to the Country Towns when they shall be required so to do, upon any important Occasion. And six Persons were accordingly chosen for that Purpose.</P>
<P>John Rowe, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> attended, and was informed that Mr. Rotch had engaged that his Vessel should carry back the Tea she bro't in the same Bottom, &amp; that it was the Expectation of this Body that he does the same by the Tea expected in Capt. Bruce; where|upon he reply'd that the Ship was under the Care of the said Master, but that he would use his utmost Endeavour, that it should go back as re|quired by this Body, and that he would give im|mediate Advice of the Arrival of said Ship.</P>
<P>VOTED, That it is the Sense of this Body that Capt. Bruce shall on his Arrival strictly conform to the Votes passed respecting Capt. Hall's Vessel, as tho' they had been all passed in Referrence to Capt. Bruce's Ship.</P>
<P>Mr Timmins appeared and informed that Capt. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>It was then Voted, That what Mr. Rowe and Mr. Timmins had offered was satisfactory to the Body.</P>
<P>Mr. Copley returned and acquainted the Body, that as he had been obliged to go to <HI>the Castle,</HI> he hoped that if he had exceeded the Time allowed him they would consider the Difficulty of a Pas|sage by Water at this Season as his Apology: He then further acquainted the Body, that he had seen all the Consignees, and tho' he had convinced them that they might attend this Meeting with safety, and had used his utmost Endeavours to prevail upon them to give Satisfaction to the Body; they acquainted him, that believing nothing would be satisfactory short of re-shipping the Tea, which was out of their Power, they thought it best not to appear, but would renew their Proposal of stor|ing the Tea, and submitting the same to the In|spection of a Committee&punc; and that they could do no further, without incurring their own Ruin; but as they had not been active in introducing the Tea, they should do nothing to obstruct the Peo|ple in their Procedure with the same.</P>
<P>It was then moved, and the Question put, Whe|ther the return made by Mr. Copley from the Consignees, be in the least Degree satisfactory to this Body, &amp; passed in the Negative. Nem. Con.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas a Number of Merchants in this Province have inadvertently imported Tea from Great Bri|tain, while it is subject to the Payment of a Duty imposed upon it by an Act of the British Parliament for the Purpose of raising a Revenue in America, and appropriating the same without the Consent of those who are required to pay it:</HI></P>
<P><HI>RESOLVED,</HI> That in thus importing said Tea, they have justly incurr'd the Displeasure of our Brethren in the other Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>And Resolved further,</HI> That if any Person or Persons shall hereafter import Tea from Great-Britain, or if any Master or Masters of any Vessel or Vessels in Great-Britain shall take the same on Board to be imported to this Place, until the said unrighteous Act shall be repeal'd, he or they shall be deem'd by this Body, an Enemy to his Country; and we will prevent the Landing and Sale of the same, and the Payment of any Duty thereon. And we will effect the Return thereof to the Place from whence it shall come.</P>
<P>RESOLVED, That the foregoing Vote be printed and sent to England, and all the Sea-Ports in this Province.</P>
<P>Upon a Motion made, Voted, That fair Copies be taken of the whole Proceedings of this Meet|ing, and transmitted to New York &amp; Philadelphia, And that
