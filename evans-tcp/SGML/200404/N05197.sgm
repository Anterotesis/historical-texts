<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE ensuing discourse is the last of three upon the same subject, with some little alterations and addi|tions. It is hoped that but few will think the subject of it an improper one to be discoursed on in the pulpit, under a notion that this is preaching politics, instead of CHRIST. However, to remove all prejudices of this sort, I beg it may be remembred, that "all scripture&mdash;is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for CORRECTION, for instruction in righteousness."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Why, then, should not those parts of scripture which relate to civil government, be ex|amined and explained <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">om the desk, as well as others? Obe|dience to the civil magistrate is a christian duty: and if so, why should not the nature, grounds and extent of it be considered in a christian assembly? Besides, if it be said, that it is out of character for a christian minister to meddle with such a subject, this censure will at last fall upon the holy apostles. They write upon it in their epistles to christian churches: And surely it cannot be deemed either criminal or impertinent, to attempt an explanation of their doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IT was the near approach of the</HI> Thirtieth <HI>of</HI> January, <HI>that turned my thoughts to this subject: on which solemnity the</HI> slavish <HI>doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance,
<PB REF="006549_0005_0000000000000000">
is often warmly asserted; and the dissenters from the esta|blished church, represented, not only as scismatics, (with more of triumph than of truth, and of choler than christianity) but also as persons of seditious, traiterous and rebellious principles&mdash;GOD be thanked one may, in any part of the</HI> british <HI>dominions, speak freely (if a decent regard be paid to those in authority) both of government and religion; and even give some broad hints, that he is engaged on the side of Liberty, the BIBLE and Common Sense, in opposition to Tyranny, PRIEST-CRAFT and Non-sense, without being in danger either of the</HI> bastile <HI>or the</HI> inquisition:&mdash;<HI>Though there will always be</HI> some <HI>interested politicians, contracted bigots, and hypocritical zealots for a party, to take offence at such freedoms.</HI> Their <HI>censure is praise:</HI> Their <HI>praise is infamy&mdash;A spirit of domination is always to be guarded against both in church and state, even in times of the greatest security; such as the present is amongst US; at least as to the latter. Those nations who are now groaning under the iron scepter of tyranny, were once free. So they might, probably, have remained, by a seasonable precaution against despotic measures. Civil tyranny is usually small in its be|ginning, like "the drop of a bucket,"</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xi. 15.</NOTE> <HI>till at length, like a mighty torrent, or the raging waves of the sea, it bears down all before it, and deluges whole countries and empires. Thus it is as to ecclesiastical tyranny also,&mdash;the most cruel, intolerable and impious, of any. From small beginnings, "it exalts itself above all that is called GOD "and that is worshipped"</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. ii. 4;</NOTE> <HI>People have no security

against being unmercifully</HI> priest-ridden, <HI>but by keeping all imperious BISHOPS, and other CLERGYMEN who love to "lord it over God's heritage," from getting their</HI> foot <HI>into the</HI> stirrup <HI>at all. Let them be once fairly</HI> mounted, <HI>and their "beasts, the laiety,"</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Leslie.</HI></NOTE> <HI>may</HI> prance <HI>and</HI> flounce <HI>about to no purpose: And they will, at length, be so</HI> jaded <HI>and</HI> hack'd <HI>by these reverend</HI> jockies, <HI>that they will not even have</HI> spirits <HI>enough to complain, that their</HI> backs <HI>are</HI> galled; <HI>or, like</HI> Balaam'<HI>s ass, to "rebuke the madness "of the prophet."</HI></P>

<P>"<HI>THE mystery of iniquity began to work"</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. ii 7.</NOTE> <HI>even in the days of some of the apostles. But the kingdom of Antichrist was then, in one respect, like the kingdom of heaven, however different in all others.&mdash;It was "as a "grain of mustard-seed."</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> <HI>This grain was sown in</HI> Italy, <HI>that fruitful field: And though it were "the least of all seeds," it soon became a mighty tree. It has, long since, overspread and</HI> darkned <HI>the greatest part of</HI> Christendom, <HI>so that we may apply to it what is said of the tree which</HI> Nebuchadnezzar <HI>saw in his vision&mdash;<Q>The height thereof reacheth unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth&mdash;And THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD have shadow under it.</Q> Tyranny brings</HI> ignorance <HI>and</HI> brutality <HI>along with it. It degrades men from their just rank, into the class of brutes. It damps their spirits. It suppresses arts. It extinguishes every spark of noble ardor and generosity in the breasts of those who are enslaved by it. It makes naturally-strong and great minds,
<PB REF="006549_0007_0000000000000000">
feeble and little; and triumphs over the ruins of virtue and humanity. This is true of tyranny in every shape. There can be nothing great and good, where its influence reaches. For which reason it becomes every friend to truth and human kind; every lover of God and the christian religion, to bear a part in opposing this hateful monster. It was a desire to contribute a mite towards carrying on a war against this common enemy, that produced the following dis|course. And if it serve in any measure, to keep up a spirit of civil and religious liberty amongst us, my end is an|swered.&mdash;There are virtuous and candid men in all sects; all such are to be esteemed: There are also vicious men and bigols in all sects; and all such</HI> ought to be despised.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-Resistance to the <HI>Higher Powers.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROM. XIII. 1.&mdash;8.</BIBL>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Whosoever therefore resisteth the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI></P>
<P>5. <HI>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</HI></P>
<P>7. <HI>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honour, to whom honour.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is evident that the affair of civil government may properly fall under: <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> considera|tion, at least so far forth as it relates to the general nature and end of magistracy, and to the grounds and extent of that submission which persons of a private character, ought to yield to those who are vested with
<PB N="2" REF="006549_0009_0000000000000000">
authority. This must be allowed by all who acknow|ledge the divine original of christianity. For although there be a sense, and a very plain and important sense, in which Christ's <HI>kingdom is not of this world;</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> his in|spired apostles have, nevertheless, laid down some general principles concerning the office of civil rulers, and the duty of subjects, together with the reason and obligation of that duty. And from hence it follows, that it is pro|per for all who acknowledge the authority of Jesus Christ, and the inspiration of his apostles, to endeavour to under|stand what is in fact the doctrine which they have deli|vered concerning this matter. It is the duty of <HI>christian</HI> magistrates to inform themselves what it is which their religion teaches concerning the nature and design of their office. And it is equally the duty of all <HI>christian</HI> peo|ple to inform themselves what it is which their religion teaches concerning that subjection which they owe to <HI>the higher powers.</HI> It is for these reasons that I have attempted to examine into the scripture-account of this matter, in order to lay it before you with the same <HI>freedom</HI> which I constantly use with relation to other doctrines and precepts of christianity; not doubting but you will <HI>judge</HI> upon every thing offered to your consideration, with the same spirit of <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>liberty</HI> with which it is <HI>spoken.</HI></P>
<P>THE passage read, is the most full and express of any in the new testament, relating to rulers and subjects: And therefore I thought it proper to ground upon it, what I had to propose to you with reference to the
<PB N="3" REF="006549_0010_0000000000000000">
authority of the civil magistrate, and the subjection which is due to him. But before I enter upon an ex|planation of the several parts of this passage, it will be proper to observe one thing which may serve as a key to the whole of it.</P>
<P>IT is to be observed, then, that there were some persons amongst the <HI>christians</HI> of the apostolic age, and particularly those at <HI>Rome,</HI> to whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> is here writing, who seditiously disclaimed <HI>all</HI> subjection to civil authority; refusing to pay taxes, and the duties laid upon their trafic and merchandize; and who scrupled not to speak of their rulers, without any due regard to their office and character. Some of these turbulent <HI>christians</HI> were converts from <HI>judaism,</HI> and others from <HI>paganism.</HI> The <HI>jews</HI> in general had, long before this time, taken up a strange conceit, that being the <HI>pecu|liar</HI> and <HI>elect</HI> people of God, they were, therefore, ex|empted from the jurisdiction of any <HI>heathen</HI> princes or governors. Upon this ground it was, that some of them, during the public ministry of our blessed Saviour, came to him with that question&mdash;<HI>Is it lawful to give tribute unto</HI> Cesar <HI>or not?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 17.</NOTE> And this notion many of them retained after they were proselyted to the <HI>chri|stian</HI> Faith. As to the <HI>gentile</HI> converts, some of them grosly mistook the nature of that <HI>liberty</HI> which the gos|pel promised; and thought that by virtue of their subjection to Christ, the <HI>only</HI> King and Head of his church, they were wholly freed from subjection to any other prince; as tho' Christ's <HI>kingdom had been of this
<PB N="4" REF="006549_0011_0000000000000000">
world,</HI> in such a sense as to interfere with the civil powers of the earth, and to deliver their subjects from that allegiance and duty, which they before owed to them. Of these visionary <HI>christians</HI> in general, who dis|owned subjection to the civil powers in being where they respectively lived, there is mention made in several places in the new-testament: The apostle <HI>Peter</HI> in par|ticular, characterizes them in this manner&mdash;<HI>them that&mdash;despise government&mdash;presumpluous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <ABBR>Pet.</ABBR> ii. 10.</NOTE> Now it is with reference to these doting <HI>christians,</HI> that the apostle speaks in the passage before us. And I shall now give you the sense of it in a paraphrase upon each verse in its order, desiring you to keep in mind the character of the persons for whom it is designed, that so, as I go along, you may see how just and natural this address is; and how well suited to the circumstances of those against whom it is levelled.</P>
<P>THE apostle begins thus&mdash;<HI>Let every soul</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Every soul.</HI> This is an <HI>bebraism,</HI> which signifies <HI>every man;</HI> so that the apostle does not exempt the <HI>clergy:</HI> such as were endow|ed with the gift of prophesy, or any other miraculous powers which subsisted in the church at that day. And by his using the <HI>hebrew</HI> idiom, it seems that he had the <HI>jowish</HI> converts principally in his eye.</NOTE> <HI>be subject unto the higher powers;</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The higher powers:</HI> more literally, the <HI>over-ruling powers:</HI> which term extends to all civil rulers in common.</NOTE> <HI>for there is no power</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">By <HI>power,</HI> the apostle intends not lawless <HI>strength</HI> and brutal <HI>force,</HI> without regulation or proper direction; but just <HI>authority;</HI> for so the word here used properly signifies. There may be <HI>power</HI> where there is no <HI>authority.</HI> No man has any <HI>authority</HI> to do what is wrong and injurious, though he may have <HI>power</HI> to do it.</NOTE> <HI>but of
<PB N="5" REF="006549_0012_0000000000000000">
God: the powers that be</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The powers that be:</HI> those persons who are in fact vested with authority; those who are in possession. And who those are, the apostle leaves christians to determine for themselves; but who|ever they are, they are to be obeyed.</NOTE> <HI>are ordained of God</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ordained of God:</HI> as it is not without God's providence and per|mission, that any are clothed with authority; and as it is agree|able to the positive will and purpose of God, that there should be <HI>some persons</HI> vested with authority for the good of society: not that any rulers have their commission immediately from God the supreme Lord of the universe. If any assert that kings, or any other rulers, are ordained of God in the latter sense, it is in|cumbent upon them to show the commission which they speak of, under the broad seal of heaven. And when they do this, they will, no doubt, be believed.</NOTE> <ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 1. <ABBR>q. d.</ABBR> <Q>Whereas some professed <HI>christians</HI> vainly ima|gine, that they are wholly excused from all manner of duty and subjection to civil authority, refusing to honour their rulers, and to pay taxes; which opini|on is not only unreasonable in itself, but also tends to fix a lasting reproach upon the <HI>christian</HI> name and profession, I now, as an apostle and ambassador of Christ, exhort every one of you, be he who he will, to pay all dutiful submission to those <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> ves|ted with any civil office. For there is, properly speaking, no authority but what is derived from God, as it is only by his permission and providence that any possess it. Yea, I may add, that all civil magistrates, as such, altho' they may be <HI>heathens,</HI> are appointed and ordained of God. For it is certainly God's will, that so useful an institution as that of magistracy, should take place in the world, for the good of civil society.</Q> The apostle proceeds&mdash;<HI>Who|soever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
<PB N="6" REF="006549_0013_0000000000000000">
of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI> <ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 2. q. d. <Q>Think not, therefore, that ye are guiltless of any crime or sin against God, when ye factiously disobey and resist the civil au|thority. For magistracy and government being, as I have said, the ordinance and appointment of God, it follows, that to resist magistrates in the execution of their offices, is really to resist the will and ordi|nance of God himself: And they who thus resist, will accordingly be punished by God for this sin in common with others.</Q> The apostle goes on&mdash;<HI>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.</HI> It can|not be supposed that the apostle designs here, or in any of the succeeding verses, to give the true character of <HI>Nero.</HI> or any other civil powers then in being, as if they were in fact such persons as he describes, a terror to evil works only, and not to the good For such a character did not belong to them; and the apostle was no sycophant, or parasite of power, what|ever some of his pretended successors have been. He only tells what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> would be, provided they acted up to their character and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> <HI>Wilt thou then, not be afraid of the power?

Will ye not, then, re|verence and honor magistracy, when ye see the good
<PB N="7" REF="006549_0014_0000000000000000">
end and intention of it? How can ye be so unreasona|ble? Only mind to do your duty as members of society; and this will gain you the applause and favour of all good rulers. For while you do thus, they are, by their office, as ministers of God, obli|ged to encourage and protect you; it is for this very purpose that they are clothed with power.</Q> The apostle subjoins&mdash;<HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for be beareth not the sword in vain. For be is the minister of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is manifest that when the apostle speaks of it, as the office of civil rulers, to encourage what is <HI>good,</HI> and to punish what is evil, he speaks only of <HI>civil good</HI> and <HI>evil.</HI> They are to consult the good of society <HI>as such;</HI> not to dictate in religious concerns; not to make laws for the government of men's consciences; and to inflict civil penalties for religious crimes. It is sufficient to over|throw the doctrine of the authority of the civil magistrate, in af|fairs of a spiritual nature, (so far as it is built upon any thing which is here said by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or upon any thing else in the new-testament) only to observe, that all the magistrates then in the world were <HI>heathen,</HI> implacable enemies to christianity: so that to give them authority in religious matters, would have been, in effect, to give them authority to extirpate the christian religion, and to establish the idolatries and superstitions of pagan|ism. And can any one reasonably suppose, that the apostle had any intention to extend the authority of rulers, beyond con|cerns merely civil and political, to the overthrowing of that reli|gion which he himself was so zealous in propagating! But it is natural for those whose religion cannot be supported upon the footing of reason and argument, to have recourse to power and force, which will serve a bad cause as well as a good one; and indeed much better.</NOTE> <ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 4. latter part. <ABBR>q. d.</ABBR> <Q>But upon the other hand, if ye refuse to do your duty as members of society; if ye refuse to bear your part in the support of government; if ye are dis|orderly, and do things which merit civil chastisement, then, indeed, ye have reason to be afraid. For it is
<PB N="8" REF="006549_0015_0000000000000000">
not in vain that rulers are vested with the power of inflicting punishment. They are, by their office, not only the ministers of God for good to those that do well; but also his ministers to revenge, to dis|countenance and punish those that are unruly, and in|jurious to their neighbours.</Q> The apostle proceeds&mdash;<HI>Wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake,</HI> <ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 5. <ABBR>q. d.</ABBR> <Q>Since there|fore, magistracy is the ordinance of God; and since rulers are, by their office, benefactors to society, by discouraging what is bad, and encouraging what is good, and so preserving peace and order amongst men; it is evident that ye ought to pay a willing subjection to them; not to obey merely for fear of exposing yourselves to their wrath and displeasure, but also in point of reason, duty and conscience: Ye are under an indispensable obligation, as <HI>christians,</HI> to honour their office, and to submit to them in the execution of it.</Q> The apostle goes on&mdash;<HI>For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing,</HI> <ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 6. <ABBR>q. d.</ABBR> <Q>And here is a plain reason also why ye should pay tribute to them; for they are God's ministers, exalted above the common level of mankind, not that they may indulge themselves in softness and luxury, and be entitled to the servile homage of their fellow-men; but that they may execute an office no less laborious than honourable; and attend continually upon the public welfare. This being their business

<P>THE apostle's doctrine, in the passage thus explained, concerning the office of civil rulers, and the duty of
<PB N="10" REF="006549_0017_0000000000000000">
subjects, may be summed up in the following obser|vations; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The several observations here only mentioned, were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of large in two preceeding discourses upon this subject.</NOTE> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>THAT the end of magistracy is the good of civil society, <HI>as such:</HI></P>
<P>THAT civil rulers, <HI>as such,</HI> are the ordinance and mi|nisters of God; it being by his permission and provi|dence that any bear rule: and agreeable to his will, that there should be <HI>some persons</HI> vested with authority in society, for the well-being of it:</P>
<P>THAT which is here said concerning civil rulers, ex|tends to all of them in common: it relates indifferently to monarchical, republican and aristocratical government; and to all other forms which truly answer the sole end of government, the happiness of society; and to all the different degrees of authority in any particular state; to inferior officers no less than to the supreme:</P>
<P>THAT disobedience to civil rulers in the due exer|cise of their authority, is not merely a <HI>political sin,</HI> but an heinous <HI>offence against God</HI> and <HI>religion:</HI></P>
<P>THAT the true ground and reason <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some suppose the apostle in this passage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 words"> submission, with <HI>two</HI> arguments quite distinct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 words">; one taken from this consideration, that rulers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> ordinance, and the ministers of God, (<ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 1. 2. and 4.) and the other, from the benefits that accrue to society, from civil government, (<ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 3, 4, and 6.) And indeed these may be distinct motives and arguments for submission, as they may be separately viewed and contemplated. But when we consider that rulers are not the ordinance and the ministers of God, but only so far forth as they perform God's will, by acting up to their office and cha|racter, and so by being benefactors to society, this makes these arguments coincide, and run up into <HI>one</HI> at last: At least so far, that the former of them cannot hold good for sub|mission, where the latter fails. Put the supposition, that any man bearing the title of a magistrate, should exercise his power in such a manner as to have no claim to obedience by virtue of that argument which is founded upon the usefulness of magi|stracy; and you equally take off the force of the other argu|ment also, which is founded upon his being the ordinance and the minister of God. For he is no longer God's ordinance and minister, than he acts up to his office and character, by exer|cising his power for the good of society&mdash;This is, in brief, the reason why it is said above, in the <HI>singular</HI> number, <HI>that the true ground and reason, &amp;c.</HI> The use and propriety of this remark may possibly be more apparent in the progress of the argument concerning resistance.</NOTE> of our obliga|tion to be subject to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> is the usefulness
<PB N="11" REF="006549_0018_0000000000000000">
of magistracy (when properly exercised) to human society, and its subserviency to the general welfare:</P>
<P>THAT obedience to civil rulers is here equally requi|red under all forms of government, which answer the sole end of all government, the good of society; and to every degree of authority in any state, whether supreme or subordinate:</P>
<P>(From whence it follows,</P>
<P>THAT if unlimited obedience and non-resistance, be here required as a duty under any one form of govern|ment, it is also required as a duty under all other forms; and as a duty to subordinate rulers as well as to the supreme.)</P>
<P>AND lastly, that those civil rulers to whom the apostle injoins subjection, are the persons <HI>in possession;
<PB N="12" REF="006549_0019_0000000000000000">
the powers that be;</HI> those who are <HI>actually</HI> vested with authority.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This must be understood with this <HI>proviso,</HI> that they do not grosly <HI>abuse</HI> their power and trust, but exercise it for the good of those that are governed. Who these persons were, whe|ther <HI>Nero,</HI> &amp;c. or not, the apostle does not say; but leaves it to be determined by those to whom he writes. God does not interpose, in a miraculous way, to point out the persons who shall bear rule, and to whom subjection is due. And as to the unalienable, indeseasible right of <HI>primogeniture,</HI> the scriptures are intirely silent: or rather plainly contradict it: <HI>Saul</HI> being the first king among the <HI>Israelites;</HI> and appointed to the royal dig|nity, during his own father's life time: and he was succeeded, or rather superseded, by <HI>David, the</HI> last <HI>born among many bre|thren</HI>&mdash;Now if <HI>God</HI> has not invariably determined this matter, it must, of course, be determined by <HI>men.</HI> And if it be deter|mined by <HI>men,</HI> it must be determined either in the way of <HI>force,</HI> or of <HI>compact.</HI> And which of these is the most <HI>equitable,</HI> can be no question.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE is one very important and interesting point which remains to be inquired into; namely, the <HI>extent</HI> of that subjection <HI>to the higher powers,</HI> which is here enjoined as a duty upon all christians. Some have thought it warrantable and glorious, to disobey the civil powers in certain circumstances; and, in cases of very great and general oppression, when humble remonstrances fail of having any effect; and when the publick welfare can|not be otherwise provided for and secured, to rise una|nimously even against the sovereign himself, in order to redress their grievances; to vindicate their natural and legal rights: to break the yoke of tyranny, and free themselves and posterity from inglorious servitude and ruin. It is upon this principle that many royal oppres|sors have been driven from their thrones into banish|ment; and many slain by the hands of their subjects.
<PB N="13" REF="006549_0020_0000000000000000">
It was upon this principle that <HI>Tarquin</HI> was expelled from <HI>Rome;</HI> and <HI>Julius Cesar,</HI> the conqueror of the world, and the tyrant of his country, cut off in the senate house. It was upon this principle, that king <HI>Charles</HI> I, was be|headed before his own banqueting house. It was upon this principle, that king <HI>James</HI> II. was made to fly that country which he aim'd at enslaving: And upon this principle was that <HI>revolution</HI> brought about, which has been so fruitful of happy consequences to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> But, in opposition to this principle, it has often been as|serted, that the scripture in general (and the passage un|der consideration in particular) makes all resistance to princes a crime, in any case whatever&mdash;If they turn ty|rants, and become the common oppressors of those, whose welfare they ought to regard with a paternal af|fection, we must not pretend to right ourselves, unless it be by prayers and tears and humble intreaties: And if these methods fail of procuring redress, we must not have recourse to any other, but all suffer ourselves to be robbed and butchered at the pleasure of the <HI>Lord's anointed;</HI> left we should incur the sin of rebellion, and the punishment of damnation. For he has God's au|thority and commission to bear him out in the worst of crimes, so far that he may not be withstood or controuled. Now whether we are obliged to yield such an absolute submission to our prince; or whether diso|bedience and resistance may not be justifiable in some cases, notwithstanding any thing in the passage before us, is an inquiry in which we are all concerned; and this is the inquiry which is the main design of the present discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006549_0021_0000000000000000">Now there does not seem to be any necessity of sup|posing, that an absolute, unlimited obedience, whether active or passive, is here injoined, merely for this reason, that the precept is delivered in <HI>absolute terms,</HI> without any <HI>exception</HI> or <HI>limitation</HI> expresly mentioned. We are enjoined, (<ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 1.) to be <HI>subject to the higher powers:</HI> and (<ABBR>ver.</ABBR> 5.) to be <HI>subject for conscience sake.</HI> And because these expressions are absolute and unlimited, (or more properly, general) some have inferred, that the subjection required in them, must be absolute and unli|mited also: At least so far forth as to make passive obedience and non-resistance, a duty in all cases what|ever, if not active obedience likewise. Though, by the way, there is here no distinction made betwixt active and passive obedience; and if either of them be requi|red in an unlimited sense, the other must be required in the same sense also, by virtue of the present argument; because the expressions are equally absolute with respect to both. But that unlimited obedience of any sort, cannot be argued merely from the indefinite expressions in which obedience is enjoined, appears from hence, that expressions of the same nature, frequently occur in scrip|ture, upon which it is confessed on all hands, that no such absolute and unlimited sense ought to be put. For example, <HI>Love not the world; neither the things that are in the world;</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Take therefore no thought for the morrow;</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi. 34.</NOTE> are precepts expressed in at least equally absolute and unli|mited terms: but it is generally allowed that they are to be understood with certain restrictions and limitati|ons;
<PB N="15" REF="006549_0022_0000000000000000">
some degree of love to the world, and the things of it, being allowable. Nor, indeed, do the <HI>Right Re|verend Fathers in God,</HI> and other <HI>dignified clergymen</HI> of the established church, seem to be altogether averse to admitting of restrictions in the latter case, how warm soever any of them may be against restrictions, and limitations, in the case of submission to authority, whe|ther civil or ecclesiastical. It is worth remarking also, that patience and submission under private injuries, are injoined in much more peremptory and absolute terms, than any that are used with regard to submission to the injustice and oppression of civil rulers. Thus, <HI>I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right check, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile with him, go with him twain.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Mat.</ABBR> <ABBR>v.</ABBR> 39, 40, 41.</NOTE> Any man may be desied to produce such strong expressions in favor of a passive and tame submission to unjust, tyran|nical rulers, as are here used to inforce submission to private injuries. But how few are there that understand those expressions literally? And the reason why they do not, is because (with submission to the <HI>quakers</HI>) common sense shows that they were not intended to be so understood.</P>
<P>BUT to instance in some scripture precepts, which are more directly to the point in hand.&mdash;Children are commanded to obey their parents, and servants, their masters, in as absolute and unlimited terms as subjects
<PB N="16" REF="006549_0023_0000000000000000">
are here commanded to obey their civil rulers. Thus this same apostle&mdash;<HI>Children obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honour thy father and mother,&mdash;which is the first commandment with promise.&mdash;Servants, be obe|dient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, with singleness of your heart as unto Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Eph.</ABBR> vi. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> Thus also wives are commanded to be obedient to their husbands&mdash;<HI>Wives, submit your selves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, even as</HI> CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<HI>Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands</HI> IN EVERY THING. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Eph.</ABBR> v. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE> In all these cases, submission is required in terms (at least) as absolute and universal, as are ever used with respect to rulers and subjects. But who supposes that the apo|stle ever intended to teach, that children, servants and wives, should, in all cases whatever, obey their pa|rents, masters and husbands respectively, never making any opposition to their will, even although they should require them to break the commandments of God, or should causelesly make an attempt upon their lives? No one puts such a sense upon these expressions, how|ever absolute and unlimited. Why then should it be supposed, that the apostle designed to teach universal obedience, whether active or passive, to <HI>the higher pow|ers,</HI> merely because his precepts are delivered in absolute and unlimited terms? And if this be a good argument in one case, why is it not in others also? If it be said
<PB N="17" REF="006549_0024_0000000000000000">
that resistance and disobedience to <HI>the higher powers,</HI> is here said positively to be a sin, so also is the disobedience of children to parents; servants, to masters; and wives, to husbands, in other places of scripture. But the ques|tion still remains, whether in all these cases there be not some exceptions? In the three latter, it is allowed there are. And from hence it follows, that barely the use of absolute expressions, is no proof, that obedience to civil rulers, is, in all cases, a duty; or resistance, in all cases a sin. I should not have thought it worth while to take any notice at all of this argument, had it not been much insisted upon by some of the advocates for passive obedience and non-resistance: For it is, in itself, perfectly trifling; and render'd considera|ble, only by the stress that has been laid upon it for want of better.</P>
<P>THERE is, indeed, one passage in the new-testament, where it may seem, at first view, that an unlimited submission to civil rulers, is injoined.&mdash;<HI>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <ABBR>Pet.</ABBR> 2. 13.</NOTE>&mdash;To <HI>every ordinance of man.</HI>&mdash;However, this expression is no stronger than that before taken notice of, with relation to the duty of wives&mdash;<HI>So let the wives be subject to their own husbands</HI>&mdash;IN EVERY THING. But the true solution of this difficulty (if it be one) is <HI>this:</HI> by <HI>every ordinance of man,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Literally, <HI>every human institution, or appointment.</HI> By which manner of expression the apostle plainly intimates, that rulers de|rive their authority <HI>immediately,</HI> not from <HI>God,</HI> but from <HI>men.</HI></NOTE> is not meant every command of the civil magistrate without exception; but <HI>every
<PB N="18" REF="006549_0025_0000000000000000">
order of magistrates appointed by man;</HI>&mdash;whether <HI>superior</HI> or <HI>inferior:</HI> For so the apostle explains himself in the very next words&mdash;<HI>Whether it be to the king as supreme, or to governors, as unto them that are sent,</HI> &amp;c. But although the apostle had not subjoined any such expla|nation, the reason of the thing itself would have obli|ged us to limit the expression <HI>[every ordinance of man]</HI> to such human ordinances and commands, as are not in|consistent with the ordinances and commands of God, the supreme lawgiver; or with any other higher, and antecedent, obligations.</P>
<P>IT is to be observed, in the next place, that as the duty of universal obedience and non-resistance to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> cannot be argued from the absolute unli|mited expressions which the apostle here uses; so neither can it be argued from the scope and drift of his rea|soning, considered with relation to the persons he was here opposing. As was observed above, there were some professed <HI>christians</HI> in the apostolic age, who dis|claimed all magistracy and civil authority in general, <HI>despising government,</HI> and <HI>speaking evil of dignities;</HI> some under a notion that <HI>jews</HI> ought not to be under the jurisdiction of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> rulers; and others, that they were set <HI>free</HI> from the temporal powers, by Christ. Now it is with persons of this licentious opinion and character, that the apostle is concerned. And all that was directly to his point, was to show, that they were bound to sub|mit to magistracy <HI>in general.</HI> This is a circumstance very material to be taken notice of, in order to ascertain
<PB N="19" REF="006549_0026_0000000000000000">
the sense of the apostle. For this being considered, it is sufficient to account for all that he says concerning the duty of subjection, and the sin of resistance, to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> without having recourse to the doctrine of unlimited submission and passive obedience, in all cases whatever. Were it known that those in opposi|tion to whom, the apostle wrote, allowed of civil au|thority in general, and only asserted that there were <HI>some cases</HI> in which obedience and non-resistance, were not a duty; there would, then, indeed, be reason for interpreting this passage as containing the doctrine of unlimited obedience, and non-resistance, as it must, in this case, be supposed to have been levelled against such as denied that doctrine. But since it is certain that there were persons who vainly imagined, that civil government in general, was not to be regarded by them, it is most reasonable to suppose, that the apostle designed his dis|course only against <HI>them.</HI> And agreeably to this suppo|sition, we find that he argues the usefulness of civil ma|gistracy in general; its agreeableness to the will and purpose of God, who is <HI>over all;</HI> and so deduces from hence, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of submission to it. But it will not follow, that because civil government, is, in general, a good institution, and necessary to the peace and happi|ness of human society, therefore there are no supposeable cases in which resistance to it can be innocent. So that the duty of unlimited obedience, whether active or pas|sive, can be argued, neither from the manner of expres|sion here used, nor from the general scope and design of the passage.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006549_0027_0000000000000000">AND if we attend to the nature of the argument with which the apostle here inforces the duty of submis|sion to <HI>the higher powers,</HI> we shall find it to be such an one as concludes not in favor of submission to all who bear the <HI>title</HI> of rulers, in common; but only, to those who <HI>actually</HI> perform the duty of rulers, by exercising a reasonable and just authority, for the good of human society. This is a point which it will be proper to en|large upon; because the question before us turns very much upon the truth or falshood of this position. It is obvious, then, in general, that the civil rulers whom the apostle here speaks of, and obedience to whom he presses upon christians as a duty, are <HI>good rulers,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By <HI>good rulers,</HI> are not intended such as are good in a <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>religious,</HI> but only in a <HI>political,</HI> sense; those who perform their duty so far as their office extends; and so far as civil society, as such, is concerned in their actions.</NOTE> such as are, in the exercise of their office and power, bene|factors to society. Such they are described to be, thro'|out this passage. Thus it is said, that they are not <HI>a terror to good works, but to the evil;</HI> that they are <HI>God's ministers for good; revengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evil;</HI> and that <HI>they attend continually upon this very thing.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> gives the same account of rulers: They are <HI>for a praise to them that do well, and the pu|nishment of evil doers.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the marginal note, page 6. See also the marginal note, p. 7.</NOTE> It is manifest that this cha|racter and description of rulers, agrees only to such as are rulers in fact, as well as in name: to such as govern well, and act agreeably to their office. And the apo|stle's argument for submission to rulers, is wholly built
<PB N="21" REF="006549_0028_0000000000000000">
and grounded upon a presumption that they do in fact answer this character; and is of no force at all upon supposition of the contrary. If <HI>rulers are a terror to good works, and not to the evil;</HI> if they are not <HI>ministers for good to society,</HI> but for evil and distress, by violence and oppression; if they <HI>execute wrath upon</HI> fober, peace|able persons, who do their duty as members of society; and suffer rich and honourable knaves to escape with impunity; if, instead of <HI>attending continually upon</HI> the good work of advancing the publick welfare, they <HI>attend</HI> only upon the gratification of their own lust and pride and ambition, to the destruction of the public welfare; if this be the case, it is plain that the apostle's argument for submission does not reach them; they are not the same, but different persons from those whom he cha|racterizes; and who must be obeyed according to his reasoning.&mdash;Let me illustrate the apostle's argument, by the following <HI>stmilitude:</HI> (it is no matter how far it is from any thing which has, in fact, happened in the world.)

a <HI>plurality of benefices;</HI>&mdash;the excellency of the <HI>devotions</HI> in <HI>that prayer book,</HI> which some of them hired <HI>chap|lains to use for them;</HI>&mdash;or some favourite point of <HI>church|tyranny,</HI> and <HI>antichristian</HI> usurpation; suppose such men as these, spending their lives in effeminacy, luxury and idleness; (or when they were not idle, doing that which is worse than idleness; suppose such men) should, merely by the merit of <HI>ordination</HI> and <HI>consecration,</HI> and a <HI>pecu|liar, odd habit,</HI> claim great respect and reverence from those whom they civilly called <HI>the beasts of the laiety;</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> and demand thousands <HI>per annum,</HI> for that good service which they&mdash;<HI>never performed;</HI> and for which, if they had performed it, this would be much more than a <HI>quan|tum meruit:</HI> suppose this should be the case, (it is only by way of <HI>simile,</HI> and surely it will give no offence) would not every body be astonished at such insolence, injustice and impiety? And ought not such men to be told plainly, that they could not reasonably expect the esteem and reward, due to the ministers of the gospel, unless they did the duties of their office? Should they not be told, that their <HI>title</HI> and <HI>habit</HI> claimed no regard, reverence or pay, separate from the <HI>care</HI> and <HI>work</HI> and various <HI>duties</HI> of their <HI>function?</HI> And that while they neglected the <HI>latter,</HI> the <HI>former</HI> served only to render them the more ridiculous and contemptible?&mdash;The appli|cation of this <HI>stmilitude</HI> to the case in hand, is very easy.&mdash;If those who bear the title of civil rulers, do not perform the duty of civil rulers, but act directly counter to the sole end and design of their office; if they

injure and oppress their subjects, instead of defending their rights and doing them good; they have not the least pretence to be honored, obeyed and rewarded, ac|cording to the apostle's argument.

<P>THIS in general. Let us now trace the apostle's reasoning in favor of submission to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> a little more particularly and exactly. For by this it will appear, on one hand, how good and conclusive it is, for submission to those rulers who exercise their power in a proper manner: And, on the other, how weak and trifling and inconnected it is, if it be supposed to be meant by the apostle to show the obligation and duty of
<PB N="25" REF="006549_0032_0000000000000000">
obedience to tyrannical, oppressive rulers in common with others of a different character.</P>
<P>THE apostle enters upon his subject thus&mdash;<HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 1.</NOTE> Here he urges the duty of obedience from this topic of argument, that civil rulers, as they are supposed to fulfil the pleasure of God, are the ordi|nance of God. But how is this an argument for obe|dience to such rulers as do not perform the pleasure of God, by doing good; but the pleasure of the devil, by doing evil; and such as are not, therefore, <HI>God's ministers,</HI> but the devil's! <HI>Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 2.</NOTE> Here the apostle argues, that those who resist a rea|sonable and just authority, which is agreeable to the will of God, do really resist the will of God himself; and will, therefore, be punished by him. But how does this prove, that those who resist a lawless, unreasonable power, which is contrary to the will of God, do therein resist the will and ordinance of God? Is re|sisting those who resist God's will, the same thing with resisting God? Or shall those who do so, <HI>receive to themselves damnation! For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good; and thou shalt have praise of the same. For he is the minister of God to thee for good.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 3d. and part of the 4th.</NOTE> Here the apostle argues more explicitly
<PB N="26" REF="006549_0033_0000000000000000">
than he had before done, for revereing, and submitting to, magistracy, from this consideration, that such as really performed the duty of magistrates, would be enemies only to the evil actions of men, and would befriend and encourage the good; and so be a common blessing to society. But how is this an argument, that we must honor, and submit to, such magistrates as are not enemies to the evil actions of men; but to the good; and such as are not a common blessing, but a common curse, to society! <HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid: For be is the minister of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 4th. Latter part.</NOTE> Here the apostle argues from the nature and end of magistracy, that such as did evil, (and such only) had reason to be afraid of the <HI>higher powers;</HI> it being part of their office to punish evil doers, no less than to de|fend and encourage such as do well. But if magistrates are unrighteous; if they are <HI>respecters of persons;</HI> if they are partial in their administration of justice; then those who do well have as much reason to <HI>be afraid,</HI> as those that do evil: there can be no safety for the good, nor any peculiar ground of terror to the unruly and in|jurious. So that, in this case, the main end of civil government will be frustrated. And what reason is there for submitting to that government, which does by no means answer the design of government? <HI>Where|fore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 5.</NOTE> Here the apostle argues the duty of a chearful and conscientious submission to civil go|vernment,
<PB N="27" REF="006549_0034_0000000000000000">
from the nature and end of magistracy as he had before laid it down. <ABBR>i.e.</ABBR> as the design of it was to punish evil doers, and to support and encourage such as do well; and as it must, if so exercised, be agreeable to the will of God. But how does what he here says, prove the duty of a chearful and conscientious subjection to those who forfeit the character of rulers? to those who encourage the bad, and discourage the good? The argument here used no more proves it to be a sin to resist such rulers, than it does, to <HI>resist the devil,</HI> that he may <HI>free from us.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James iv. 7. </NOTE> For one is as truly the <HI>minister of God</HI> as the other. <HI>For, for this cause pay you tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 6.</NOTE> Here the apostle argues the duty of paying taxes, from this consideration, that those who perform the duty of rulers, are continually attending upon the public welfare. But how does this argument conclude for paying taxes to such princes as are conti|nually endeavouring to ruin the public? And especially when such payment would facilitate and promote this wicked design! <HI>Render therefore to all their dues; tri|bute, to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; bonor, to whom bonor.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Ver.</ABBR> 7.</NOTE> Here the apostle sums up what he had been saying concerning the duty of subjects to rulers. And his argument stands thus&mdash;<Q> Since magistrates who execute their office well, are common benefactors to society; and may, in that respect, be properly stiled <HI>the ministers and ordi|nance of God;</HI> and since they are constantly employed
<PB N="28" REF="006549_0035_0000000000000000">
in the service of the public; it becomes you to pay them tribute and custom; and to reverence, honor, and submit to, them in the execution of their re|spective offices.</Q> This is apparently good reasoning. But does this argument conclude for the duty of paying tribute, custom, reverence, honor and obedience, to such persons as (although they bear the title of rulers) use all their power to hurt and injure the public? such as are not <HI>God's ministers,</HI> but <HI>satan's?</HI> such as do not take care of, and attend upon, the public interest, but their own, to the ruin of the public? that is, in short, to such as have no natural and just claim at all to tribute, custom, reverence, honor and obedience? It is to be hoped that those who have any regard to the apostle's character as an inspired writer, or even as a man of common understanding, will not represent him as reasoning in such a loose incoherent manner; and draw|ing conclusions which have not the least relation to his premises. For what can be more absurd than an argu|ment thus framed? <Q>Rulers are, by their office, bound to consult the public welfare and the good of so|ciety: therefore you are bound to pay them tribute, to honor, and to submit to them, even when they destroy the public welfare, and are a common pest to society, by acting in direct contradiction to the nature and end of their office.</Q></P>
<P>THUS, upon a careful review of the apostle's reasoning in this passage, it appears that his arguments to enforce submission, are of such a nature, as to conclude only in favour of submission <HI>to such rulers as he himself describes:</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="006549_0036_0000000000000000">
<ABBR>i.e.</ABBR> such as rule for the good of society, which is the only end of their institution. Common tyrants, and public oppressors, are not intitled to obedience from their subjects, by virtue of any thing here laid down by the inspired apostle.</P>
<P>I NOW add, farther, that the apostle's argument is so far from proving it to be the duty of people to obey, and submit to, such rulers as act in contradiction to the public good, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This does not intend, their acting so in a <HI>few particular instances,</HI> which the best of rulers may do through mistake, &amp;c. but their acting so <HI>habitually;</HI> and in a manner which plainly shows, that they aim at making themselves great, by the ruin of their subjects.</NOTE> and so to the design of their office, that it proves <HI>the direct contrary.</HI> For, please to observe, that if the end of all civil government, be the good of society; if this be the thing that is aimed at in constituting civil rulers; and if the motive and argument for submission to government, be taken from the apparent usefulness of civil authority; it follows, that when no such good end can be answered by sub|mission, there remains no argument or motive to enforce it; if instead of this good end's being brought about by submission, a <HI>contrary end</HI> is brought about, and the ruin and misery of society effected by it, here is a plain and positive reason against submission in all such cases, should they ever happen. And therefore, in such cases, a regard to the public welfare, ought to make us with-hold from our rulers, that obedience and sub|jection which it would, otherwise, be our duty to render to them. If it be our duty, for example, to obey our king, merely for this reason, that he rules for the pub|lic
<PB N="30" REF="006549_0037_0000000000000000">
welfare, (which is the only argument the apostle makes use of) it follows, by a parity of reason, that when he turns tyrant, and makes his subjects his prey to devour and to destroy, instead of his charge to defend and cherish, we are bound to throw off our allegiance to him, and to resist; and that according to the tenor of the apostle's argument in this passage. Not to dis|continue our allegiance, in this case, would be to join with the sovereign in promoting the slavery and mi|sery of that society, the welfare of which, we ourselves, as well as our sovereign, are indispensably obliged to se|cure and promote, as far as in us lies. It is true the apostle puts no case of such a tyrannical prince; but by his grounding his argument for submission wholly upon the good of civil society; it is plain he implicitly autho|rises, and even requires us to make resistance, whenever this shall be necessary to the public safety and happiness. Let me make use of this easy and familiar <HI>similitude</HI> to illustrate the point in hand&mdash;Suppose God requires a family of children, to obey their father and not to resist him; and inforces his command with this argument; that the superintendence and care and authority of a just and kind parent, will contribute to the happiness of the whole family; so that they ought to obey him for their own sakes more than for his: Suppose this parent at length runs distracted, and attempts, in his mad sit, to cut all his children's throats: Now, in this case, is not the reason before assigned, why these children should obey their parent while he continued of a sound mind, namely, <HI>their common good,</HI> a reason equally conclusive
<PB N="31" REF="006549_0038_0000000000000000">
for disobeying and resisting him, since he is become delirious, and attempts their ruin? It makes no alteration in the argument, whether this parent, properly speaking, loses his reason; or does, while he retains his understand|ing, that which is as fatal in its consequences, as any thing he could do, were he really deprived of it. This similitude needs no formal application&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT it ought to be remembred, that If the duty of universal obedience and non-resistance to our king or prince, can be argued from this passage, the same unli|mited submission under a republican, or any other form of government; and even to all the subordinate powers in any particular state, can be proved by it as well: which is more than those who alledge it for the menti|oned purpose, would be willing should be inferred from it. So that this passage does not answer their purpose; but really overthrows and confutes it. This matter deserves to be more particularly considered.&mdash;The ad|vocates for unlimited submission and passive obedience, do, if I mistake not, always speak with reference to kingly or monarchical government as distinguished from all other forms; and, with reference to submitting to the will of the king, in distinction from all subordinate officers, acting beyond their commission, and the autho|rity which they have received from the crown. It is not pretended that any person besides kings, have a di|vine right to do what they please, so that no one may resist them, without incurring the guilt of factiousness and rebellion. If any other supreme powers oppress the
<PB N="32" REF="006549_0039_0000000000000000">
people, it is generally allowed, that the people may get redress, by resistance, if other methods prove inef|fectual. And if any officers in a kingly government, go beyond the limits of that power which they have de|rived from the crown, (the supposed original source of all power and authority in the state) and attempt, ille|gally, to take away the properties and lives of their fel|low-subjects, they may be <HI>forcibly</HI> resisted, at least till application can be made to the crown. But as to the sovereign himself, he may not be resisted in any case; nor any of his officers, while they confine themselves within the bounds which he has prescribed to them. This is, I think, a true sketch of the principles of those who defend the doctrine of passive obedience and non|resistance. Now there is nothing in scripture which supports this scheme of political principles. As to the passage under consideration, the apostle here speaks of civil rulers in <HI>general;</HI> of all persons in <HI>common,</HI> vested with authority for the good of society, without any par|ticular reference to one form of government, more than to another; or to the supreme power in any particular state, more than to subordinate powers. The apostle does not concern himself with the different forms of go|vernment. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The essence of government (I mean <HI>good</HI> government; and this is the <HI>only</HI> government which the apostle treats of in this pas|sage, consists in the <HI>making</HI> and <HI>executing of good laws</HI>&mdash;laws attempted to the common felicity of the <HI>governed.</HI> And if this be, <HI>in fact,</HI> done, it is evidently, in it self, a thing of no consequence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> form of government is;&mdash;whether the son, or in <HI>different</HI> persons;&mdash;whether in <HI>one</HI> person, whom we call an <HI>absolute monarch;</HI>&mdash;whether in a <HI>few,</HI> so as to constitute an <HI>aristocrasy;</HI>&mdash;whether in <HI>many,</HI> so as to constitute a <HI>republic;</HI> or whether in <HI>three co-ordinate branches,</HI> in such manner as to make the government <HI>partake</HI> something of <HI>each</HI> of these forms; and to be, at the same time, <HI>essentially different</HI> from them <HI>all.</HI> If the <HI>end</HI> be attained, it is enough. But no form of government seems to be so unlikely to accomplish this <HI>end,</HI> as <HI>absolute mo|narchy</HI>&mdash;&mdash;Nor is there any one that has so little pretence to a <HI>divince original,</HI> unless it be in this sense, that God <HI>first</HI> introduced it into, and thereby overturned, the common wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> as a <HI>curse</HI> upon that people for their <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>wickedness,</HI> particularly in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> such a government.(See I <HI>Sam.</HI> viii. chap.) Just so God, before, sent <HI>Quails</HI> amongst them, as a <HI>plague,</HI> and a <HI>curse,</HI> and not as a <HI>blessing. Numb.</HI> chap. xi.</NOTE> This he supposes left intirely to human prudence
<PB N="33" REF="006549_0040_0000000000000000">
prudence and discretion. Now the consequence of this is, that unlimited and passive obedience, is no more enjoined in this passage, under monarchical government; or to the supreme power in any state, than under all other species of government, which answer the end of government; or, to all the subordinate degrees of civil authority, from the highest to the lowest. Those, therefore, who would from this passage infer the guilt of resisting kings, in all cases whatever, though acting ever so contrary to the design of their office, must,if they will be consistent, go much farther, and infer from it the guilt of resistance under all other forms of government; and of resisting <HI>any petty officer</HI> in the state, tho acting beyond his commission, in the most arbitrary, illegal manner possible. The argument holds equally strong in both cases. All civil rulers, as such, are the <HI>ordinance</HI> and <HI>ministers of God;</HI> and they are all, by the nature of their office, and in their respective spheres and stations, bound to consult the public welfare. With the same reason therefore, that any deny unlimited and passive obedi|ence
<PB N="34" REF="006549_0041_0000000000000000">
to be here injoined under a republic or aristocrasy, or any other established form of civil government; or to subordinate powers, acting in an illegal and oppressive manner; (with the same reason) others may deny, that such obedience is enjoined to a king or monarch, or any civil power whatever. For the apostle says nothing that is <HI>peculiar to kings;</HI> what he says, extends equally to <HI>all</HI> other persons whatever, vested with any civil office. They are all, in exactly the same sense, the <HI>ordinance of God;</HI> and the <HI>ministers of God;</HI> and obedience is equally enjoined to be paid to them all. For, as the apostle expresses it, <HI>there is</HI> NO POWER <HI>but of God:</HI> And we are requi|red to <HI>render to</HI> ALL <HI>their</HI> DUES; and not MORE than their DUES. And what these <HI>dues</HI> are, and to <HI>whom</HI> they are to be <HI>rendered,</HI> the apostle <HI>sayeth not;</HI> but leaves to the reason and consciences of men to determine.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, that the common argument, grounded upon this passage, in favor of universal, and passive obedience, really overthrows itself, by proving too much, if it proves any thing at all; namely, that no civil officer is, in any case whatever, to be resisted, though acting in express contradiction to the design of his office; which no man, in his senses, ever did, or can assert.</P>
<P>IF we calmly consider the nature of the thing itself, nothing can well be imagined more directly contrary to common sense, than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> suppose that <HI>millions</HI> of people should be subjected to the arbitrary, precarious pleasure
<PB N="35" REF="006549_0042_0000000000000000">
of <HI>one single man;</HI> (who has <HI>naturally</HI> no superiority over them in point of authority) so that their estates, and every thing that is valuable in life, and even their lives also, shall be absolutely at his disposal, if he happens to be wanton and capricious enough to demand them. What unprejudiced man can think, that God made ALL to be thus subservient to the lawless pleasure and phrenzy of ONE, so that it shall always be a sin to resist him! Nothing but the most plain and express revelation from heaven could make a sober impartial man believe such a monstrous, unaccountable doctrine, and, indeed, the thing itself, appears so shocking&mdash;so out of all <HI>propor|tion,</HI> that it may be questioned, whether all the <HI>miracles</HI> that ever were wrought, could make it credible, that this doctrine <HI>really</HI> came from God. At present, there is not the least syllable in scripture which gives any coun|tenance to it. The hereditary, indefeasible, divine right of kings, and the doctrine of non-resistance, which is built upon the supposition of such a right, are altogether as fabulous and chimerical, as transubstantiation; or any of the most absurd reveries of ancient or modern visionaries. These notions are fetched neither from divine revelation, nor human reason; and if they are derived from neither of those sources, it is not much matter from <HI>whence they come, or whither they go.</HI> Only it is a pity that such doctrines should be propagated in society, to raise fac|tions and rebellions, as we see they have, in fact, been both in the <HI>last,</HI> and in the <HI>present,</HI> REIGN.</P>
<P>BUT then, if unlimited submission and passive obedi|ence to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> in all possible cases, be not a
<PB N="36" REF="006549_0043_0000000000000000">
duty, it will be asked, <Q>How far are we obliged to submit? If we may innocently disobey and resist in some cases, why not in all? Where shall we stop? What is the measure of our duty? This doctrine tends to the total dissolution of civil government; and to introduce such scenes of wild anarchy and con|fusion, as are more fatal to society than the worst of tyranny.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this manner, some men object; and, indeed, this is the most plausible thing that can be said in favor of such an absolute submission as they plead for. But the worst (or rather the best) of it, is, that there is very little strength or solidity in it. For similar difficulties may be raised with respect to almost every duty of natural and revealed religion.&mdash;To instance only in two, both of which are near akin, and indeed exactly parallel, to the case before us. It is unquestionably the duty of children to submit to their parents; and of servants, to their masters. But no one asserts, that it is their duty to obey, and submit to them, in all supposeable cases; or universally a sin to resist them. Now does this tend to subvert the just authority of parents and masters? Or to introduce confusion and anarchy into private families? No. How then does the same principle tend to unhinge the govern|ment of that larger family, the body politic? We know, in general, that children and servants are obliged to obey their parents and masters respectively. We know also, with equal certainty, that they are not obliged to submit to them in all things, without exception; but may, in some cases, reasonably, and therefore innocently,
<PB N="37" REF="006549_0044_0000000000000000">
resist them. These principles are acknowledged upon all hands, whatever difficulty there may be in fixing the exact limits of submission. Now there is at least as much difficulty in stating the measure of duty in these two cases, as in the case of rulers and subjects. So that this is really no objection, at least no reasonable one, against resistance to the <HI>higher powers:</HI> Or, if it is one, it will hold equally against resistance in the other cases mentioned.&mdash;It is indeed true, that turbulent, vicious|minded men, may take occasion from this principle, that their rulers may, in some cases, be lawfully resisted, to raise factions and disturbances in the state; and to make resistance where resistance is needless, and therefore, sin|ful. But is it not equally true, that children and ser|vants of turbulent, vicious minds, may take occasion from this principle, that parents and masters may, in some cases be lawfully resisted, to resist when resistance is un|necessary, and therefore, criminal? Is the principle in either case false in itself, merely because it may be abu|sed; and applied to legitimate disobedience and resist|ance in those instances, to which it ought not to be applied? According to this way of arguing, there will be no true principles in the world; for there are none but what may be wrested and perverted to serve bad pur|poses, either through the weakness or wickedness of men.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">WE may very safely assert these two things in general, without undermining government: One is, That no civil rulers are to be obeyed when they enjoin things that are inconsistent with the commands of God: All such disobedience is lawful and glorious; particularly, if persons refuse to comply with any <HI>legal establishment of religion,</HI> because it is a gross perversion and corruption (as to doctrine, worship and discipline) of a pure and divine religion, brought from heaven to earth by the <HI>Son of God,</HI> (the only King and Head of the <HI>christian</HI> church) and propagated through the world by his inspired apostles. All commands running counter to the declared will of the supreme legislator of heaven and earth, are null and void: And therefore disobedience to them is a duty, not a crime. (See the marginal note, page 7.)&mdash;Another thing that may be asserted with equal truth and safety, is, That no go|vernment is to be submitted to, at the <HI>expence</HI> of that which is the <HI>sole end</HI> of all government,&mdash;the common good and safety of society. Because, to submit in this case, if it should ever happen, would evidently be to set up the <HI>means</HI> as more valuable, and a|bove, the <HI>end:</HI> than which there cannot be a greater solecism and contradiction. The only reason of the institution of civil govern|ment; and the only rational ground of submission to it, is the common safety and utility. If therefore, in any case, the com|mon safety and utility would not be promoted by submission to government, but the contrary, there is no ground or motive for obedience and submission, but, for the contrary.
WHOEVER considers the nature of civil government must, indeed, be sensible that a great degree of <HI>implicit confidence,</HI> must un|avoidably be placed in those that hear rule: this is implied in the very notion of authority's being originally a <HI>trust,</HI> committed by the people, to those who are vested with it, as all just and righ|teous authority is; all besides, is mere lawless force and usurpa|tion; neither God nor nature, having given any man a right of dominion over any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> independently of that society's ap|probation, and consent to be governed by him&mdash;Now as all men are fallible, it cannot be supposed that the public affairs of any state, should be always administred in the best manner possible, even by persons of the greatest wisdom and integrity. Nor is it sufficient to legitimate disobedience to the <HI>higher powers</HI> that they are not so administred; or that they are, in some instances, very ill-managed; for upon this principle, it is scarcely supposeable that any government at all could be supported, or subsist. Such a principle manifestly tends to the dissolution of government; and to throw all things into confusion and anarchy.&mdash;But it is equally evident, upon the other hand, that those in authority may abuse their <HI>trust</HI> and power <HI>to such a degree,</HI> that neither the law of reason, nor of religion, requires, that any obedience or submission should be paid to them; but, on the contrary, that they should be totally <HI>discarded;</HI> and the authority which they were before vested with, transferred to others, who may exercise it more to those good purposes for which it is given.&mdash;Nor is this principle, that resistance to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> is, in some ex|traordinary cases, justisiable, so liable to abuse, as many persons seem to apprehend it. For although there will be always some petulant, querulous men, in every state&mdash;men of sactious, tur|bulent and carping dispositions,&mdash;glad to lay hold of any trifle to justify and legitimate their caballing against their rulers, and other seditious practices: yet there are, comparatively speaking, but few men of this <HI>contemptible character.</HI> It does not appear but that mankind, in general, have a disposition to be as submis|sive and passive and tame under government as they ought to be&mdash;Witness a great, if not the greatest, part of the known world, who are now groaning, but not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> under the heavy yoke of tyranny! While those who govern, do it with any toler|able degree of moderation and justice, and, in any good measure act up to their office and character, by being public benefactors; the people will generally be easy and peaceable; and be rather inclined to flatter and adore, than to insult and resist, them. Nor was there ever any <HI>general</HI> complaint against any administration, <HI>which lasted long,</HI> but what there was good reason for. Till people find themselves greatly abused and oppressed by their gover|nors, they are not apt to complain; and whenever they do, in fact, find themselves thus abused and oppressed, they must be stupid not to complain.

<P>FOR what reason, then, was the resistance to king <HI>Charles,</HI> made? The general answer to this inquiry is, that it was on account of the <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>oppression</HI> of his reign. Not a great while after his accession to the throne, he married a <HI>french catholic;</HI> and with her seemed to have <HI>wedded</HI> the politics, if not the religion of <HI>France,</HI> also. For afterwards, during a reign, or rather a tyranny of many years, he governed in a perfectly wild and arbi|trary manner, paying no regard to the constitution and the laws of the kingdom, by which the power of the crown was limited; or to the solemn oath which he had taken at his coronation. It would be endless, as well as needless, to give a particular account of all the illegal and despotic measures which he took in his administra|tion;&mdash;partly from his own natural lust of power, and partly from the influence of wicked councellors and

<P>BUT by whom was this resistance made?

It was they that when the king was about levying forces against his subjects, in order to make himself absolute, commissioned officers, and raised an army to defend themselves and the public: And it was they that maintained the war against him all along, till he was made a prisoner. This is indisputable. Though it was not properly speaking the parliament, but the army, which put him to death afterwards. And it ought to be freely acknowledged, that most of their proceed|ing, in order to get this matter effected; and particu|larly the court by which the king was at last tried and condemned, was little better than a mere mockery of justice.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE next question which naturally arises, is, whether this resistance which was made to the king <HI>by the par|liament,</HI> was properly <HI>rebellion,</HI> or not? The answer to which is plain, that it was not; but a most righteous and glorious stand, made in defence of the natural and legal rights of the people, against the unnatural and illegal encroachments of arbitrary power. Nor was this a rash

and too sudden opposition. The nation had been patient under the oppressions of the crown, even to <HI>long suf|fering;</HI>&mdash;for a course of many years; and there was no rational hope of redress in any other way&mdash;Resistance was absolutely necessary in order to preserve the nation from slavery, misery and ruin. And who so proper to make this resistance as the lords and commons;&mdash;the whole representative body of the people;&mdash;guardians of the public welfare; and each of which was, in point of le|gislation, vested with an equal, co-ordinate power, with that of the crown? <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>english</HI> constitution is originally and essentially <HI>free.</HI> The charac|ter which <HI>J. Cesar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> both give of the ancient <HI>Britains</HI> so long ago, is, That they were extremely <HI>jealous of their liberties,</HI> as well as a people of a <HI>martial</HI> spirit. Nor have there been wanting frequent instances and proofs of the same glorious spirit (in both respects) remaining in their posterity ever since,&mdash;in the struggles they have made for liberty, both against foreign and domestic tyrants.&mdash;Their kings hold their title to the throne, solely by grant of parliament; i. e. in other words, by the voluntary consent of the people. And, agreably hereto, the prerogative and rights of the crown are stated, defined and limited by law; and that as truly and strictly as the rights of any in|ferior officer in the state; or indeed, of any private subject. And it is only in this respect that it can be said, that "the king can. "do no wrong." Being restrained by the law, he cannot, while he confines himself within those just limits which the law prescribes to him as the measure of his authority, injure and oppress the subject.&mdash;The king, in his coronation oath, swears to exercise only such a power as the constitution gives him: And the subject, in the oath of allegiance, swears only to obey him in the exercise of such a power. The king is as much bound by his oath, not to infringe the legal rights of the people, as the people are bound to yield subjection to him. From whence it follows, that as soon as the prince sets himself up above law, he loses the king in the tyrant: he does to all intents and pur|poses, unking himself, by acting out of, and beyond, that sphere which the constitution allows him to move in. And in such cases, he has no more right to be obeyed, than any inferior of|ficer who acts beyond his commission. The subjects obligation to allegiance <HI>then</HI> ceases of course: and to resist him, is no more <HI>rebellion,</HI> than to resist any foreign invader. There is an essential difference betwixt <HI>government and tyranny;</HI> at least under such a constitution as the <HI>english.</HI> The former consists in ruling ac|cording to law and equity; the latter, in ruling contrary to law and equity. So also, there is an essential difference betwixt re|sisting a tyrant, and rebellion; The former is a just and reasona|ble self defence; the latter consists in resisting a prince whose ad|ministration is just and legal: and this is what denominates it a crime.&mdash;Now it is evident, that king <HI>Charles'</HI>s government was illegal, and very oppressive, through the greatest part of his reign: And, therefore, to resist him, was no more rebellion, than to op|pose any foreign invader, or any other domestic <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> Here were <HI>two</HI> branches of the
<PB N="46" REF="006549_0053_0000000000000000">
legislature against <HI>one;</HI>&mdash;two, which had law and equity and the constitution on their side, against one which was impiously attempting to overturn law and equity and the constitution; and to exercise a wanton licentious <HI>sovereign|ty</HI> over the properties, consciences and lives of all the people:&mdash;Such a <HI>sovereignty</HI> as some inconsiderately ascribe to the supreme Governor of the world.&mdash;I say, inconsi|derately; because God himself does not govern in an absolutely arbitrary and despotic manner. The power of this Almighty King (I speak it not without caution and reverence; the power of this Almighty King) is <HI>limited by law;</HI> not, indeed, by <HI>acts of parliament,</HI> but by the eternal <HI>laws</HI> of truth, wisdom and equity; and the ever|lasting <HI>tables</HI> of right reason;&mdash;tables that cannot be <HI>repealed,</HI> or <HI>thrown down</HI> and <HI>broken</HI> like those of <HI>Moses.</HI>&mdash;But king <HI>Charles</HI> sat himself up above all these, as much as he did above the written laws of the realm; and made mere humor and caprice, which are no rule at all, the only rule and measure of his administration. And now, is it not perfectly ridiculous to call resistance to such a tyrant, by the name of <HI>rebellion?</HI>&mdash;<HI>the grand rebellion?</HI> Even that&mdash;parliament, which brought king
<PB N="47" REF="006549_0054_0000000000000000">
<HI>Charles</HI> II. to the throne, and which run <HI>loyally mad,</HI> severely reproved one of their own members for condem|ning the proceedings of that parliament which first took up arms against the former king. And upon the same principles that the proceedings of this parliament may be censured as wicked and rebellious, the proceedings of those who, since, opposed king <HI>James</HI> II, and brought the prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to the throne, may be censured as wicked and rebellious also. The cases are parallel.&mdash;But whatever <HI>some</HI> men may <HI>think,</HI> it is to be hoped that, for their own sakes, they will not dare to <HI>speak</HI> against the REVOLUTION, upon the justice and legality of which depends (in part) his present MAJESTY's right to the throne.</P>
<P>IF it be said, that although the parliament which first|opposed king <HI>Charles'</HI>s measures, and at length took up arms against him, were not guilty of rebellion; yet cer|tainly those persons were, who condemned, and put him to death; even this perhaps is not true. For he had, in fact, <HI>unkinged</HI> himself long before, and had forfeited his title to the allegiance of the people. So that those who put him to death, were, at most only guilty of <HI>murder;</HI> which, indeed, is bad enough, if they were really guilty of <HI>that;</HI> (which is at least disputable.) <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and those who were principally concerned in the <HI>nominal</HI>) king's death, might possibly have been very vicked and designing men. Nor shall I say any thing in vindication of the reigning <HI>hypocrisy</HI> of those times; or of <HI>Cromwell'</HI>s male-administration during the <HI>inter|regnum:</HI> (for it is <HI>truth,</HI> and not a <HI>party,</HI> that I am speak|ing
<PB N="48" REF="006549_0055_0000000000000000">
for.) But still it may be said, that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and his adherents were not, properly speaking, guilty of <HI>rebellion;</HI> because he, whom they beheaded was not, properly speak|ing, <HI>their king;</HI> but a <HI>lawless tyrant.</HI>&mdash;much less, are the whole body of the nation at that time to be charged with rebellion on that account; for it was no <HI>national act;</HI> it was not done by a <HI>free</HI> parliament. And much less still, is the nation at present, to be charged with the great sin of rebellion, for what their <HI>ancestors</HI> did, (or rather did NOT) a century ago.</P>
<P>BUT how came the <HI>anniversary</HI> of king <HI>Charles'</HI>s death, to be solemnized as a day of fasting and humiliation? The true answer in brief, to which inquiry, is, that this fast was instituted by way of <HI>court</HI> and <HI>complement</HI> to king <HI>Charles</HI> II, upon the <HI>restoration.</HI> All were desirous of making their court to him; of ingratiating themselves; and of making him forget what had been done in oppo|sition to his <HI>father,</HI> so as not to revenge it. To effect this, they ran into the most extravagant professions of affection and loyalty to him, insomuch that he himself said, that it was a <HI>mad</HI> and <HI>hair brain'd</HI> loyalty which they professed. And amongst other strange things, which his first parliament did, they ordered the <HI>Thirtieth</HI> of <HI>January</HI> (the day on which his father was beheaded) to be kept as a day of solemn humiliation, to deprecate the judgments of heaven for the rebellion which the nation had been guilty of, in that which was no national thing; and which was not rebellion in them that did it&mdash;Thus they soothed and flattered their new king, at the expence
<PB N="49" REF="006549_0056_0000000000000000">
of their liberties:&mdash;And were ready to yield up <HI>freely</HI> to <HI>Charles</HI> II, all that enormous power, which they had justly resisted <HI>Charles</HI> I, for usurping to himself.</P>
<P>THE last query mentioned, was, Why those of the <HI>episcopal clergy</HI> who are very high in the principles of <HI>ecclesiastical authority,</HI> continue to speak of this unhappy prince as a <HI>great Saint</HI> and a <HI>Martyr?</HI> This, we know, is what they constantly do, especially upon the 30th of <HI>January;</HI>&mdash;a day sacred to the <HI>extolling</HI> of <HI>him,</HI> and to the <HI>reproaching</HI> of those who are not of the <HI>established church.

as absurd and unreasonable, notwithstanding they have solemnly subscribed what is equivalent to it in <HI>their own articles of religion.</HI> And therefore one would hardly ex|pect that they would lay the guilt of the king's death upon <HI>us,</HI> altho' <HI>our fore-fathers</HI> had been the only authors of it. But this conduct is much more surprising, when it does not appear that <HI>our</HI> ancestors had any more hand in it than <HI>their own.</HI>&mdash;However, bigotry is sufficient to ac|count for this, and many other <HI>pbenomena,</HI> which cannot be accounted for in any other way.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the observation of this <HI>anniversary</HI> seems to have been (at least) superstitious in its <HI>original;</HI> and al|though it is often abused to very bad purposes by the esta|blished clergy, as they serve themselves of it, to perpetuate strife, a party spirit, and divisions in the christian church; yet it is to be hoped that one good end will be answered by it, quite contrary to their intention: It is to be hoped, that it will prove a standing <HI>memento,</HI> that <HI>Britons</HI> will not be <HI>slaves;</HI> and a warning to all corrupt <HI>councellors</HI> and <HI>ministers,</HI> not to go too far in advising to arbitrary, des|potic measures&mdash;</P>
<P>To conclude: Let us all learn to be <HI>free,</HI> and to be <HI>loyal.</HI> Let us not profess ourselves vassals to the lawless pleasure of any man on earth. But let us remember, at the same time, government is <HI>sacred,</HI> and not to be <HI>trisled</HI> with. It is our happiness to live under the government of a PRINCE who is satisfied with ruling according to law; as every other <HI>good prince</HI> will&mdash;We enjoy under his ad|ministration all the liberty that is proper and expedient

for us. It becomes us, therefore, to be contented, and dutiful subjects. Let us prize our freedom; but not <HI>use our liberty for a cloke of maliciousness.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 16.</NOTE> There are men who strike at <HI>liberty</HI> under the term <HI>licenliousness.</HI> There are others who aim at <HI>popularity</HI> under the dis|guise of <HI>patriolism.</HI> Be aware of both. <HI>Extremes</HI> are dangerous. There is at present amongst <HI>us,</HI> perhaps, more danger of the <HI>latter,</HI> than of the <HI>former.</HI> For which reason I would exhort you to pay all due Regard to the government over us; to the KING and all in authority; and to <HI>lead a quiet and peaceable life.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 2.</NOTE>&mdash;And while I am speaking of loyalty to our <HI>earthly Prince,</HI> suffer me just to put you in mind to be loyal also to the supreme RULER of the universe, <HI>by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii. 15.</NOTE> To which king eter|nal immortal, invisible, even to the ONLY WISE GOD, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 17.</NOTE> be all honor and praise, DOMINION and thanksgiving, through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.
