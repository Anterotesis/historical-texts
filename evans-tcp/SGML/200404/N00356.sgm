<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IT may reasonably be supposed that we shall find in this part of the world, many men, both old and young, that are strangers, in a great measure, to the true understanding of that inestimable Inheritance that every <HI>Free-born Subject</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is Heir unto by <HI>Birth-right,</HI> I mean that unparalell'd Privi|ledge of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> beyond all the Na|tions in the world beside; and it is to wisht that all men did rightly understand their own happiness there|in; in pursuance of which I do here present thee with that antient Garland, the <HI>Fundamental Laws of England,</HI> bedeckt with many precious Priviledges of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> by which every man that is a Subject to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> may understand what is his Right, and how to preserve it from unjust and unreasonable men: whereby appears the eminent Care, VVisdom and Industry of our Progenitors in providing for themselves and Posterity so good a For|tress that is able to repel the <HI>Lust, Pride</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Noble,</HI> as well as <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>Ignoble;</HI> it being that excellent and discreet Ballance that gives every man his even proportion, which cannot be taken from him, nor be dispossessed of his <HI>Life, Liberty</HI> or <HI>Estate,</HI> but by the tryal and judgment of <HI>Twelve</HI> of his <HI>Equals,</HI> or <HI>Law of the Land,</HI> upon the penalty of the bitter Curses of the whole People; so great was the zeal of our Predecessors for the preservation of
<PB REF="000433_0003_0FA5AAEB8972CED8">
these Fundamental Liberties (contained in these Char|ters) from encroachment, that they imployed all their Policy and Religious Obligations to secure them intire and inviolable, albeit the contrary hath often been endeavoured, yet providence hitherto hath preserved them as a Blessing to the <HI>English Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>The chief end of the Publication hereof is for the information and understanding (what is their native Right and Inheritance) of such who may not have leisure from their Plantations to read large Volumns; And beside, I know this Country is not furnished with Law-Books, &amp; this being the Root from whence all our wholesom English Laws spring, and indeed the Line by which they must be squared, I have ventured to make it publick, hoping it may be of use and service to many Free-men, Planters and Inhabitants in this Country, to whom it is sent and recommended, wish|ing it may raise up Noble Resolutions in all the Free|holders in these new Colonies, not to give away any thing of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> that at present they do, (or of right as Loyal English Subjects, ought to) enjoy, but take up the good Example of our Ancestors, and understand, that it is easie to part with or give away great Priviledges, but hard to be gained, if once lost. And therefore all depends upon our prudent Care and Actings to preserve and lay sure Founda|tions for our selves and the Posterity of our Loyns.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>France,</HI> and other Nations, the meer Will of the Prince is Law, his Word takes off any mans Head, imposeth Taxes, or seizes any mans Estate, when, how and as often as he lists; and if one be accused, or but so much as suspected of any Crime, he may either presently Execute him, or Banish, or Imprison him at pleasure; or if he will be so gracious as to proceed by form of their Laws, if any two Villians will but swear against the poor Party, his Life is gone; nay, if there be no <HI>witness,</HI> yet he may be put <HI>on</HI> the <HI>Rack,</HI> the Tortures whereof make many an innocent Person confess himself guilty, and then with seem|ing Justice is executed. But,</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> is both the <HI>measure</HI> and the <HI>bound</HI> of every Subjects Duty and Allegiance, each man having a fixed Fundamental-Right born with him, as to <HI>Freedom of his Person</HI> and <HI>Property in his Estate,</HI> which he cannot be depriv'd of, but either by his <HI>Consent,</HI> or some <HI>Crime,</HI> for which the Law has impos'd such a penalty or forfeiture. For all our Kings take a solmn Oath (1.) At their Coronation, <HI>To observe &amp; cause the Laws to be kept:</HI> (2.) All our Judges take an Oath, wherein among other points they swear, <HI>To do equal Law and Right to all the Kings Subjects, Rich and Poor, and not to delay any person of common Right for the Letters of the King, or of any other Person, or for any other
<PB REF="000433_0005_0FA5AAF05B7484C8">
cause:</HI> Therefore saith <HI>Forteseue,</HI> (who was first chief Justice, and afterwards L. Chancellor to K. <HI>Henry</HI> 6.) in his Book <HI>de Laudibus Legum Angliae,</HI> cap. 9. <HI>Non potest Rex Anglia, &amp;c. The King of</HI> England <HI>cannot alter nor change the Laws of his Realm at his pleasure; For why, he governeth his people by Power not only Royal, but also Politick: If his Power over them were only Regal, then he might change the Laws of his Realm, and charge his Subjects with Tallage and other Burthens, without their con|sent; but from this much differeth the Power of a King whose Government is</HI> Politick; <HI>for he can neither change Laws without the consent of his Subjects, nor yes charge them with Impositions against their wills.</HI> With which accords <HI>Bracton,</HI> a learned Judge &amp; Law-Author, in the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 3d, saying, <HI>Rex in Regno suo superiores habet Deum &amp; Legem</HI>; i. e. <HI>The King in his Realm hath two supe|riors, God and the Law</HI>; for he is under the <HI>Di|rective,</HI> tho' not <HI>Co-ercive</HI> Power of the Law.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Law it self affirms, <HI>The King can do no wrong,</HI> which proceeds not only from a pre|sumption, that so excellent a Person <HI>will do none,</HI> but also because he acts nothing but by <HI>Ministers,</HI> which (from the lowest to the highest) are answer|able for their doings; so that if a K. in passion should command <HI>A.</HI> to kill <HI>B.</HI> without process of Law, <HI>A.</HI> may yet be prosecuted by Indictment or upon an <HI>Appeal</HI> (where no Royal Pardon is allow|able) and must for the same be exceuted, such Command notwithstanding.</P>
<P><PB REF="000433_0006_0FA5AAF598FA4980">This original happy Frame of Government is truly and properly call'd an <HI>English mans Liberty,</HI> a <HI>Priviledge</HI> not exempt from the Law, but to be freed in Person &amp; Estate from <HI>Arbitrary Violence</HI> and <HI>Oppression.</HI> A <HI>greater Inheritance</HI> (saith Judg <HI>Cook) is deriv'd to every one of us from our Laws than from our Parents</HI>; For without the former, what would the latter signifie? And this Birth-right of English-men shines most conspicuously in two things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>PARLIAMENTS.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>IVRIES.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By the <HI>First</HI> the Subject has a share by his cho|sen Representatives in the <HI>Legislative</HI> (or Law-making) Power; for no new Laws bind the People of <HI>England,</HI> but such as are by common consent agreed on in that great Council.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Second,</HI> he has a share in the <HI>Executive</HI> part of the Law, no Causes being tryed, nor any man adjudged to loose Life, Member or Estate, but upon the <HI>Verdict of his Peers</HI> or Equals his Neighbours, and of his own Condition: These two grand Pillars of English Liberty, are the <HI>Fundamental vital Priviledges,</HI> whereby we have been, and are preserv'd more free and happy than any other People in the World, and (we trust) shall ever continue so: For whoever shall design to impair, pervert or undermine either of these, do <HI>strike at the very Constitution of our Government,</HI> and ought to be <HI>prosecuted</HI> and <HI>punished</HI> with the <HI>utmost Zeal</HI> and <HI>Rigour.</HI> To cut down the Banks

let in the Sea, or <HI>to poyson all the Springs</HI> and <HI>Rivers</HI> in the Kingdom, could not be a greater Mischief; for this would only affect the present Age, but the other will Ruin and enslave all our <HI>Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>But beside these <HI>Paramount Priviledges</HI> which the English are estated in by the <HI>Original Consti|tution</HI> of their <HI>Government,</HI> there are others more particularly declared and expressed in di|vers <HI>Acts of Parliament</HI> too large to be inserted in this place.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="000433_0026_0FA5AB105F422E98">
<HEAD>The COMMENT on Magna CHARTA.</HEAD>
<P>THis excellent Law holds the first place in our Statute Books, for though there were, no doubt, many Acts of Parliament long before this, yet they are not now extant; 'tis called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the great Charter, not in respect of its bulk, but in regard of the great im|portance and weight of the matters therein contained; it is also stiled, <HI>Charta Libertatum Regni,</HI> The Charter of the Liberties of the Kingdom; And upon great Reason (saith <HI>Cook</HI> in his Proem) is so called, from the effect, <HI>quia Liberus facit,</HI> because it makes and preserves the People free. Though it run in the stile of the King, as a Charter, yet (as my L. <HI>Cook</HI> well observes on the 38 chap.) it appears to have passed in Parliament; for there was then a fifteenth granted to the King by the <HI>Bishops, Earls, Barrons, free Tenants</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> which could not be, but in Parliament, nor was it unusual in those times to have Acts of Parliament in a form of a Charter, as you may read in the Princes Case, <HI>Coo. Rep. l.</HI> 8.</P>
<P>Likewise, though it be said here, <HI>That the King hath given and granted these Liberties,</HI> yet
<PB N="20" REF="000433_0027_0FA5AB110D5AF5E8">
they must not be understood as meer Emana|tions of Royal favour, or new Bounties grant|ed, which the People could not justly challange, or had not a right unto before; for the Lord <HI>Cook</HI> in divers places asserts, and all Lawyers know, that this Charter is for the most part only Declaratory of the principal ground of the Fun|damental Laws and Liberties of <HI>England</HI>; No new Freedom is hereby granted, but a Restitu|tion of such as lawfully they had before, and to free them of what had been usurped and en|croached upon them by any Power whatsoever; and therefore you may see this <HI>Charter</HI> often mentions <HI>sua jura,</HI> their Rights and Liberties, which shews they had them before, and that the same now were confirmed.</P>
<P>As to the occasion of this Charter, it must be noted, that our Ancestors, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> had with a most equal poize and Temperament, very wisely contrived their Government, and made excellent Provisions for their Liberties, and to preserve the People from Oppression; and when <HI>William,</HI> the <HI>Norman,</HI> made himself Master of the Land, though he be commonly called the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> yet in truth he was not so, and I have known several Judges that would reprehend any Gentleman at the Bar that casually gave him that Title; for though he killed <HI>Harrold</HI> the Usurper, and routed his Army, yet he pre|tended a right to the Kingdom, and was admit|ted
<PB N="21" REF="000433_0028_0FA5AB11CEAE6C40">
by compact, and did take an Oath to observe the Laws and Customs.</P>
<P>But the truth is, he did not perform that Oath so as he ought to have done, &amp; his Successor <HI>Wil|liam Rufus,</HI> King <HI>Stephen, Henry</HI> the 1st, &amp; <HI>Richard</HI> likewise made frequent encroachments upon the Liberties of their People; but especially King <HI>Iohn</HI> made use of so many illegal devices to drain them of Money, that wearied with intollerable Oppressions, they resolved to oblige the King to grant them their Liberties, and promise the same should be observed, which King <HI>Iohn</HI> did in <HI>Running-Mead</HI> between <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Windsor,</HI> by two Charters, one called, <HI>Charta Libertatum,</HI> The Charter of Liberties (the form of which you may read in <HI>Matthew Paris, fol.</HI> 246. and is in effect the same with this here recited) the other, <HI>The Charter of the Forrest,</HI> Copies of which he sent into every County, and command|eth the Sheriff, &amp;c. to see them fulfilled.</P>
<P>But by ill Council he quickly after began to violate them as much as ever, whereupon Di|sturbances and great Miseries arose, both to him|self and the Realm. The Son and Successor of this King <HI>Iohn,</HI> was <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who in the 19th Year of his Reign, renewed and con|firmed the said Charters; but within two Years after cancelled them by the pernicious Advice of his <HI>Favourites,</HI> perticularly <HI>Hubert de Burgh,</HI> whom he had made Lord chief Justice; one that in for|mer times had been a great lover of his Country,
<PB N="22" REF="000433_0029_0FA5AB128415BEF0">
and a well-deserving Patriat, as well as learned in the Laws, but now to make this a step to his Ambition (which ever Rideth without Reins) perswaded and humoured the King, that he might avoid the Charters of his Father King <HI>Iohn,</HI> by Duress, and his own Great Chatrer, and <HI>Charta de Foresta</HI> also, for that he was with|in Age, when he granted the same; whereupon the King in the eleventh Year of his Reign, be|ing then of full Age, got one of the Great Char|ters, and of the Forrest into his Hands, and by the Counsel principally of this <HI>Hubert</HI> his Chief Justice, at a Council holden at <HI>Oxford,</HI> unjustly cancelled both the said Charters, (notwith|standing the said <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI> was the Pri|mary Witness of all Temporal Lords to both the said Charters) whereupon he became in high favour with the King, insomuch that he was soon after (<HI>viz.</HI> the 10th of <HI>December,</HI> in the 13th Year of that King) created (to the highest Dignity that in those times a Subject had) to be an Earl, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI>: But soon after (for Flatterers &amp; Humorists have no sure foundation) he fell into the King's heavy Indignation, and af|ter many fearful and miserable Troubles, he was justly, and according to Law, sentenced by his Peers in an open Parliament, and justly degraded of that Dignity, which he unjustly had obtained by his Counsel, for cancelling of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and <HI>Charta de Foresta.</HI></P>
<P>In the 9th Chapter of this Great Charter, all
<PB N="23" REF="000433_0030_0FA5AB1338336BB0">
the Ancient Liberties and Customs of <HI>London</HI> are confirmed and preserved, which is likewise done by divers other Statutes, as 14 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. Chap. 2 <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The 29th Chapter, NO FREE-MAN SHALL BE TAKEN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Deserves to be written in Letters of Gold; and I have often wondred the Words thereof are not Inscribed in Capitals on all our Courts of Judicature, Town-Halls, and most publick Edifices; they are the <HI>Elixer</HI> of our <HI>English Freedoms,</HI> the Store-house of all our Liberties. And because my Lord <HI>Cook</HI> in the second part of his <HI>Institutes,</HI> hath many excel|lent Observations, his very Words I shall here Recite.</P>
<P>This Chapter containeth Nine several Branches.</P>
<P>First. <HI>That No man be taken or imprisoned, but</HI> per legem terrae; that is, by the Common-Law, Statute-Law, or Custom of <HI>England</HI>; for these words, <HI>per legem terrae,</HI> being towards the end of this Chapter, do refer to all the precedent matters in this Chapter; and this hath the first place, because the Liberty of a man's Person is more precious to him, than all the rest that fol|low, and therefore it is great Reason that he should by Law be relieved therein, if he be wronged, as hereafter shall be shewed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>No man shall be desseised</HI>; that is, put out of Seisin, <HI>or dispossessed of his Free-hold,</HI> that is, Lands or Livelihood, <HI>or of his Liberties, or free Customs,</HI> that is, of such Franchises and Free|doms,
<PB N="24" REF="000433_0031_0FA5AB15A987A338">
and free Customs as belong to him, by his free Birth-right, unless it be by the the lawful Judgment, that is, Verdict of his Equals (that is, of men of his own Condition) or by the Law of the Land, that is (to speak it once for all) by the due Course and Process of Law</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>No man shall be Out-lawed, made an</HI> Ex lex, <HI>put out of the Law,</HI> that is, deprived of the Benefit of the Law, unless he be Out-lawed ac|cording to the Law of the Land.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>No man shall be Exiled or Banished out of his Country,</HI> that is, <HI>nemo predit patriam,</HI> no man shall lose his Country, unless he be Exiled according to the Law of the Land.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>No man shall in any sort be destroyed,</HI> (Destruere id est quod prius structum &amp; factum fuit penitus Evertere Ex diruere) <HI>unless it be by the Verdict of his Equals&punc; or according to the Law of the Land.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6thly. <HI>No man shall be condemned at the King's Suite, either before the King in his Beneh,</HI> where the Pleas are <HI>Coram Rege</HI> (and so are the Words, <HI>nec super eum ibimus,</HI> to be understood) nor be|fore any other Commissioner or Judge what|soever; and so are the words, <HI>nec super eum Mi|timus,</HI> to be understood, <HI>but by the Iudgment of his Peers,</HI> that is, equals, or according to the Law of the Land</P>
<P N="7">7thly. <HI>We shall sell to no man Iustice or Right.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8thly. <HI>We shall deny to no man Iustice or Right.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9thly. <HI>We shall defer to no man Iustice or Right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="000433_0032_0FA5AB17E39F6668">Each of these we shall briefly explain:</P>
<P>1st; <HI>No man shall be taken,</HI> (that is) restrain|ed of Liberty by Petition, or suggestion to the King or his Council, unless it be by Indictment or Presentment of good and lawful men, where such Deeds be done. This Branch, and divers other parts of this Act, have been notably Ex|plained and Construed by divers Acts of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P N="2">2dly; <HI>No man shall be Disseised,</HI> &amp;c. Hereby is intended that <HI>Lands, Tenements, Goods</HI> and <HI>Chattels,</HI> shall not be seised into the King's hands contrary to this Great Charter, and the Law of the Land; nor any man shall be disseised of his Lands or Tenements, or dispossessed of his Goods or Chattels, contrary to the Law of the Land.</P>
<P><HI>A Custom was alledged in the Town of</HI> C. <HI>that if the Tenant cease by two Years, that the Lord should enter into the Freehold of the Tenant, and hold the same until he were satisfied of the Arrearages.</HI> It was adjudged a Custom against the Law of the Land, to enter into a mans Freehold in that case, without Action or Answer.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6th, granted to the Corpo|ration of Dyers within <HI>London, Power to search,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And if they found any Cloth dyed with Log-Wood, that the Cloth should be forfeit.</HI> And it was adjudged, that this Charter concerning the For|feiture, was against the Law of the Land, and this Statute; for no Forfeiture can grow by Letters Pattents.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="000433_0033_0FA5AB196015E9B8">No man ought to be put from his Livelihood, without Answer.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, [<HI>No man Out-lawed</HI>] that is, barred to have the benefit of the Law. And note, to this word <HI>Out-lawed,</HI> these words, <HI>unless by the Law of the Land,</HI> do refer [<HI>of his Liberties:</HI>] This word hath three Significations.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> As it hath been said, it signifieth <HI>the Laws of the Realm,</HI> in which respect this Charter is called <HI>Charta Libertatum,</HI> as afore-said.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> It signifieth <HI>The Freedom the Subjects of</HI> Eng|land <HI>have:</HI> for example, the <HI>company</HI> of Merchant-Taylors of <HI>England,</HI> having power by their Char|ter to make Ordinances, made an Ordinance, <HI>That every Brother of the same Society should put the one half of his Cloaths to be dressed by some Cloath-worker free of the same Company, upon pain to for|feit ten Shillings,</HI> &amp;c. And it was adjudged that this Ordinance was against Law, because it was against the <HI>Liberty of the Subject,</HI> for every Sub|ject hath freedom to put his Cloaths to be dres|sed by whom he will, <HI>&amp;c. sic de similibus.</HI> And so it is, if such, or the like Grant had been made by the Letters Pattents.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly, Liberties</HI> signifie the Franchizes &amp; Privi|ledges, which the Subjects have of the Gift of the King, as the <HI>Goods &amp; Chattels of Fellons, Out-Laws,</HI> and the like, or which the Subject claims by Prescription, as <HI>Wrack, Waif, Stray,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>So likewise, and for the same Reason, if a Grant be made to any man, to have the sole ma|king of <HI>Cards,</HI> or the sole dealing with any other
<PB N="27" REF="000433_0034_0FA5AB1A21BBD188">
Trade, that Grant is against the Liberty and Freedom of the Subject, that before did, or lawfully might have used that Trade, and con|sequently against this Great Charter.</P>
<P>Generally all <HI>Monopolies</HI> are against this great Charter, because they are against the Liberty and Freedom of the Subject, and against the Law of the Land.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly, [No man Exiled]</HI> that is, Banisht, or forced to depart, or stay out of <HI>England,</HI> with|out his consent, or by the Law of the Land: No man can be exiled, or banished out of his Native Country, but either by Authority of Parliament, or in case of Abjuration for Fellony, by the Com|mon-Law: And so when our Books, or any Re|cords, speak of Exile or Banishment, other than in case of Abjuration, it is to be intended to be done by Authority of Parliament, as <HI>Belknap</HI> and other Judges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> banished into <HI>Ireland</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the second.</P>
<P>This is a beneficial Law, and is construed be|nignely; And therefore the King cannot send any Subject of <HI>England</HI> against his Will to serve him out of the Realm, for that should be an Exile; and he should <HI>perdere patriam</HI>: No, he cannot be sent against his Will into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to serve the King or his Deputy there, because it is out of the Realm of <HI>England</HI>; for if the King might send him out of his Realm to any place, then under pretence of Service, as Ambassador, or the like, he might send him into the furthest
<PB N="28" REF="000433_0035_0FA5AB1ACE341FA8">
parts of the World, whom being an Exile, is prohibited by this Act.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly, [No man destroyed]</HI> that is, Fore-judged of Life or Limbs, or put to torture or death, every Oppression against Law, by colour of any usurp|ed Authority, is a kind of Destruction, and the words <HI>aliquo modo,</HI> any otherwise, are added to the verb <HI>destroyed,</HI> and to no other Verb in this Chapter; and therefore all things, by any manner of means, tending to Destruction, are prohibited: As if a man be accused or indicted of Treason or Fellony, his Lands or Goods can|not be granted to any, no, not so much as by <HI>promise,</HI> nor any of his Lands or Goods seized into the Kings hand, before he is attainted; for when a Subject obtaineth a promise of the for|feiture, many times undue means, and more violent Prosecution is used for private Lucre, tending to destruction, than the quiet and just proceeding of the Law would permit; and the party ought to live of his own until Attainder.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, [<HI>By lawful judgment of his Peers</HI>] that is, by his equals, men of his own Rank and Con|dition. The general division of Persons, by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> is, either one that is <HI>Noble,</HI> and in respect of his <HI>Nobility,</HI> of the <HI>Lords House of Parliament,</HI> or one of the <HI>Commons,</HI> and in respect thereof, of the <HI>House of Commons in Parliament.</HI> And as there be divers degrees of Nobility, as <HI>Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts</HI> and <HI>Barrons,</HI> and yet all of them are compre|hended
<PB N="29" REF="000433_0036_0FA5AB1D163BA298">
under this word <HI>Peers,</HI> and are <HI>Peers of the Realm</HI>; so of the <HI>Commons,</HI> they be <HI>Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, Citizens</HI> and <HI>Yeomen,</HI> and yet all of them of the <HI>Commons of the Realm.</HI> And as every of the <HI>Nobles</HI> one is a <HI>Peer</HI> to another, though he be of a several degree, so it is of the <HI>Commons</HI>; and as it hath been said of Men, so doth it hold of Noble Women, either by Birth or Marriage.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as this Judgment by Peers is called <HI>lawful,</HI> it shews the Antiquity of this man|ner of Tryal: it was the antient accustom|ed legal course long before this Charter.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, [<HI>Or by the Law of the Land</HI>] that is, by due Process of Law, for so the Words are expresly expounded by the Statute of 37 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. Chap. 8. and these Words are especially to be refered to those fore-going, to whom they re|late; As, <HI>none shall be Condemned without a law|ful Tryal by his Peers,</HI> so <HI>none shall be Taken,</HI> or <HI>Imprisoned,</HI> or <HI>put out of his Freehold, without due Process of the Law</HI>; that is, by the Indictment or Presentment of good and lawful men of the place, in due manner, or by Writ original of the Common-Law.</P>
<P>Now, seeing that no man can be Taken, Ar|rested, Attached, or Imprisoned, but by due Process of Law, and according to the Law of the Land, these Conclusions hereupon do follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Person or Persons which commit any, must have Lawful Authority.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="000433_0037_0FA5AB1D26B2BD00">2. It is necessary that the Warrant or Mitti|mus be Lawful, and that must be in Writing un|der his Hand and Seal.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Cause must be contained in the War|rant, as for <HI>Treason, Fellony,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>suspicion of Trea|son</HI> or <HI>Fellony,</HI> or the like perticular Crime: for if it do not thus specifie the Cause, if the Prisoner bring his <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> he must be discharged, because no Crime appears on the return; nor is it in such case any Offence at all, if the Prisoner make his escape&punc; whereas if the <HI>Mutimus</HI> contain the Cause; the escape would respective|ly be <HI>Treason</HI> or <HI>Fellony,</HI> though in truth he were not Guilty of the first Offence, and this mention|ing the Cause, is agreeable to Scripture, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.</P>
