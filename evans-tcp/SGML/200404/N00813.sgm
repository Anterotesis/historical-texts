<HEAD>The Deposition of <HI>Bartholomew Green,</HI> PRINTER.</HEAD>
<P>WHO Testifies and Says, That on <HI>Saturday,</HI> some time last Summer, Mr. <HI>Thomas Brattle,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Zech. Tuthill</HI> came to my Work House in <HI>Boston,</HI> and brought with them a Manuscript of small Writing for me to Print; and calling me aside to one end of the Room, desired me to be private in it, and to keep it from the <HI>Mathers</HI>; informing me that it was an Answer to Old Mr. <HI>Mathers</HI> Book, of the <HI>Order of the Gospel.</HI> And after I had taken it into my hand, Mr. <HI>Brattle</HI> told me, it was not yet ready, he would Transcribe it. They asked me how much I thought it would make: I answered, Three Sheets, or something more, in <HI>Octavo</HI>; and told them I could not do it before the Laws were Printed, which would be next <HI>Monday</HI> or <HI>Tuesday.</HI> They asked me how much Paper Three Sheets would take to Print a Thousand: I answered about Seven Ream. They ask|ed me how much I would have a Sheet; I answered, <HI>Two and Twenty Shillings.</HI> They said, I could do it cheaper. I reply'd, Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle</HI> was very curious in Correcting. They told me, That would be for my Credit, or to that purpose. After some other words, I consented to do it for <HI>Twenty Shillings&punc; Per</HI> Sheet: Whereupon they told me, they would have the Paper of Mr. <HI>George</HI>; and so went away, taking the Copy with them. After they were gone, it came into my mind what great distu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bance the <HI>Manifesto</HI> had made (which I Printed very privately at said <HI>Tuthill</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s desire) which made me the more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful, lest this might give more Offence. Yet for all, I went not to the Reverend Praesident; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her did I receive any Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">couragement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom him, or any of his Friends, as to my Printing of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Monday</HI> or <HI>Tuesday</HI> following, Mr. <HI>Zechariah Tuthill</HI> came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">one to my Printing Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, where I was, and guessing at his Business, I de|sired him to walk out with me.

Whereupon he said, There are three or four that are the Authors of it. Then I desired only that I might men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion it to the Lieuten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Governour, or ask his Approbation; which said I, I ought to do in Books of Controversy.

And understanding His Honour was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be in Town that day, I was to wait on him for that end. This is the substance of what pass'd between Mr. <HI>Tuthill</HI> and me.</P>
<P>A little while a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, in the same day, Mr. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hn Mico,</HI> and the sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr. <HI>Zechariah Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hill</HI> came to me to my Printing Room, and charged me by no means to go to the Lieutenant Governour; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or they would not have him know of it. After this, there passed some discourse concerning Mr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI>'s Book, the <HI>Order of the Gospel,</HI> and of Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s Book, of <HI>Institu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Churches,</HI> as I understood.

<P>THE shortness of my Advertisement of the 21<HI>st.</HI> of <HI>December</HI> 1700. having rendred it less intelligible, &amp; given Occasion for some Ex|ceptions that have been since tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n against it: for this reason I have ex|plained it in the foregoing Depositions. As also because there being no mention made in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">position of Mr. <HI>Thomas Brattle</HI> and Mr. <HI>Zechariah Tuthill</HI> of the 27<HI>th</HI> of <HI>December</HI>&punc; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their speaking to me to Prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Copy <HI>privately</HI>; some might happily think, I <HI>Owned</HI> that they did not speak to me to do it <HI>privat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly</HI>: Whenas I declar'd to the contrary.

I never did <HI>Own</HI>; neither doth the Attestation of the Honourable Justi|ces import I did.</P>
<P>And because what pass'd between Mr. <HI>Zechariah Tuthill</HI> &amp; me singly, is wholly Omitted in both the Depositions said <HI>Tuthill</HI> was concernd in.</P>
<P>The Sum is, Whenas no Name appeared in the Title Page; nor so much as the Name of any Author was told me, when I requested it; &amp; I had no opportunity to read it over my self; the Piece being also Con|troversal: I concluded it would be altogether inconvenient for me to Print it upon my own head without asking advice; for which I referr'd my self to the Honourable <HI>William Stoughton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> our Lieutenant Governour, who became Commander in Chief of the Province before the Week was out. For His Excellency the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>BELLOMONT,</HI> our Gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nour, began his Voyage to <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w York,</HI> upon <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1700. the very next day after Mr. <HI>Mico</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tuthill</HI> were with me. Nor was it a new thing to shew Copies to the Lieutenant Gover|nour in order to their being Printed Mr. <HI>Sewall</HI>'s <HI>Phaenomena Apocalyp|tica</HI> was taken off the Press, and carried to the Lieutenant Governour for his Allowance. By the same Token, one Half Sheet being wrought off too soon: the Author was at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Charge to Print it over again, to gratify His Honour in some Alterations that could not otherwise be made. Besides other Instances tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> might be given. And considering the Lieut. Governours Eminent Qualification to judge of Books; the Station God has given him in the <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w-English</HI> Church; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e good Offices he has done for Mr. <HI>Benjamin Colman</HI> and his Church in particular: Every one that is not a Stranger in <HI>Boston</HI> may wonder at it, that a Book Dedicated to the Churches of Christ in <HI>N England,</HI> a motion to have it first view'd by his Honour, should be rejected with so much Disdain. For my own part, The obstinate Refusal of so fair an Arbiter, made me fear some foul Play: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich is the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">incipal Aw that I remember my self to have been under.</P>
<P>In fine, the Maintenance of my self &amp; Family of small Children, de|pending under God, upon the good will of them that please to set me on Work&punc; I have no intent to provoke or affront any person or Order of men; but to oblige them so far as is consistent with clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of my Reputation; which (as little and low as I am) ought to be more eligible to me than much gainful business. And now having truly &amp; uprightly given an Ac|count of my doing in this matter, I humbly submit it to the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itable Censure of every judicious &amp; Impartial Reader.</P>
