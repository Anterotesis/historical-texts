<HEAD>Father Abraham's Speech, introduced
by Poor Richard, viz.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard that Nothing gives an Author so
great Pleasure, as to find his Works respect|fully
quoted by other learned Authors. This
Pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for though I have
been, if I may say it without Vanity, an emi|nent
Author of Almanacks annually now a full
Quarter of a Century, my Brother-Authors in the
same Way, for what Reason I know not, have ever
been very sparing in their Applauses&punc; and no other
Author has taken the least Notice of me, so that did
not my Writings produce me some solid Puddin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">
the great Deficiency of Praise would have qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" REASON="missing">
discouraged me.</P>
<P>I concluded at length, that the People were the
best Judges of my Merit; for they buy thy Works;
and besides, in my Rambles, where I am not per|sonally
known, I have frequently heard one or other
of my Adages repeated, with `as Poor Richard says,'
at the End on't. This gave me some Satisfaction,
as it shewed not only that my Instructions were re|garded,
but discovered likewise some Respect for
my Authority; and I own that, to encourage the
Practice of remembering and repeating those wise
Sentences, I have sometimes quoted myself, with
great Gravity.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010619_0003_0F81B929B3A680F0">
Judge then how much I must have been grati|fied
by an incident I am going to relate to you. I
stopt my Horse lately where a great Number of
People were collected at a Vendue of Merchant
Goods. The Hour of Sale not being come, they
were conversing on the Badness of the Times, and
one of the Company call'd to a plain clean old
Man, with white Locks, Pray, Father Abraham,
what think you of the Times? Won't these heavy
Taxes quite ruin the Country? How shall we be ever
able to pay them? What would you advise us to?
&mdash;Father Abraham stood up and reply'd, If you'd
have my advice, I'll give it you in short, for A
Word to the Wise is enough, and many Words won't
fill a Bushel, as Poor Richard says. They joined
in desiring him to speak his Mind, and gathering
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" REASON="missing">und him, he proceeded as follows.
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those
laid on by the Government were the only Ones
we had to pay, we might more easily discharge
them; but we have many others, and much more
grievous to some of us. We are taxed twice as
much by our Idleness, three times as much&punc; by our
Pride, and four times as much by our Folly, and
from these Taxes Collectors cannot ease or deliver
us by allowing an Abatement. However, let us
hearken to good Advice, and something may be
done for us. God helps them that help themselves,
as Poor Richard says, in his Almanack.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010619_0004_0F81B92A6A303390">
It would be thought a hard Government that should
tax its People one tenth Part of their Time, to be
employed in its Service. But Idleness taxes many
of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in
absolute Sloth, or doing of Nothing, with that which
is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that
amount to Nothing. Sloth, by bringing on Dis|eases,
absolutely shortens Life. Sloth, like Rust,
consumes faster than Labour wears, while the used
Key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But
dost thou love Life? then do not squander Time, for
that's the Stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard says:
How much more than is necessary do we spend in
Sleep! forgetting that the sleeping Fox catches no
Poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the
Grave, as Poor Richard says. If Time be of all
Things the most precious, wasting Time must
be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest Prodigality,
since, as he elsewhere tells us, Lost Time is never
found again: and what we call Time enough, always
proves little enough. Let us then up and be doing,
and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we
do more with less Perplexity. Sloth makes all Things
difficult, but industry all easy, as Poor Richard says;
and he that rises late, must trot all Day, and shall
scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness
travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him,
as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy
Business, let not that drive thee; and early to Bed,
and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy and
wise.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010619_0005_0F81B92B0F7F7BC8">
So what signifies wishing and hoping for better
Times. We may make these Times better if we
bestir ourselves. Industry need not wish, as Poor
Richard says, and he that lives upon Hope will die
fasting. There are no Gains without Pains; then
help Hands, for I have no Lands, or if I have, they
are smartly taxed. And, as Poor Richard likewise
observes, He that hath a Trade hath an Estate, and
he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and
Honor; but then the Trade must be worked at,
and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate,
nor the Office, will enable us to pay our Taxes. If
we are industrious we shall never starve; for, as Poor
Richard says, At the working Man's House Hunger
looks in, but dares not enter. Nor will the Bailiff or
the Constable enter, for Industry pays Debts, while
Despair encreaseth them, says Poor Richard. What
though you have found no Treasure, nor has any
rich Relation left you a Legacy, Diligence is the
Mother of Good-luck, as Poor Richard says, &amp; God
gives all Things to Industry: Then plough deep, while
Sluggards sleep, and you shall have Corn to sell and
to keep, says Poor Dick. Work while it is called To|day,
for you know not how much you may be
hindered To-morrow, which makes Poor Richard
say One To-day is worth two To-morrows; and far|ther,
Have you somewhat to do To-morrow? do it
To-day. If you were a Servant, would you not be
ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle?
Are you then your own Master? Be ashamed to catch
<PB N="7" REF="010619_0006_0F81B92C8C8137B8">
yourself idle, as poor Dick says. When there is so
much to be done for your Self, your Family, and
your Country, be up by Peep of Day: Let not
the Sun look down and say, <HI>Inglorious here he lies.</HI>
Handle your Tools without Mittens; remember
that the Cat in Gloves catches no Mice, as Poor
Richard says. 'Tis true, their is much to be done,
and perhaps you are weak-handed, but stick to it
steadily, and you will see great Effects, for con|stant
Dropping wears away Stones, and by Dili|gence
and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Ca|ble;
and little Strokes fell great Oaks, as Poor
Richard says in his Almanack, the Year I cannot
now remember.</P>
<P>Methinks I hear some of you say, Must a Man
afford himself no Leisure? I will tell thee, my
Friends, what Poor Richard says. Employ thy Time
well if you meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou
art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour.
Leisure is Time for doing something useful; this&punc;
Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy
Man never; so that as Poor Richard says, a life of
Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two Things.
Do you imagine that Sloth will afford you more
Comfort than Labour? No; for, as Poor Richard
says, Trouble springs from Idleness, &amp; grievous Toil
from needless Ease. Many without Labor, would live
by their <HI>Wits</HI> only, but they break for want of Stock.
Whereas Industry gives Comfort, and Plenty, and
Respect. Fly Pleasures and they'll follow you.&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="010619_0007_0F81B92FCCB908C8">
The diligent Spinner has a large Shift; and now I
have a Sheep and a Cow, every Body bids me Good-Morrow;
all which is well said by Poor Richard.</P>
<P>But with our Industry, we must likewise be steady
settled and careful, and oversee our own Affairs with
our own Eyes, and not trust too much to others; for,
as Poor Richard says.
<Q><L>I never saw an oft removed Tree,</L>
<L>Nor yet an oft removed Family,</L>
<L>That throve so well as those that settled be.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again, Three Removes is as bad as a Fire;
and again, Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep
thee; and again, If you would have your Business
done, go; if not, send. And again,
<Q><L>He that by the Plough would thrive,</L>
<L>Himself must either hold or drive.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again, The Eye of a Master will do more
Work than both his Hands; and again, Want of
Care does us more Damage than want of Knowledge;
and again, Not to oversee Workmen, is to leave
them your Purse open. Trusting too much to others
Care is the ruin of many; for as the Almanack says,
In the Affairs of this World, Men are saved, not by
Faith, but by the Want of it; but a Man's own
Care is profitable; for, saith Poor Dick, Learning
is to the Studious, and Riches to the Careful, as
well as Power to the Bold, and Heaven to the Vir|tuous.
And farther, If you would have a faithful
Servant, and one that you like,&mdash;serve your Self.
And again, he adviseth to Circumspection and
<PB N="9" REF="010619_0008_0F81B9311AAFD150">
Care, even in the smallest Matters, because some|times
a little Neglect may breed great Mischief&punc;
adding, For want of a Nail, the Shoe was lost; for
want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of
a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and
slain by the Enemy, all for want of Care about a
Horse-shoe Nail.</P>
<P>So much for Industry, my Friends, and Atten|tion
to one's own Business; but to these we must
add Frugality, if we would make our Industry more
certainly successful. A Man may, if he knows not
how to save as he gets, keep his Nose all his Life to
the Grindstone, and die not worth a Groat at last.
A fat Kitchen makes a lean Will, as Poor Richard
says; and,
<Q><L>Many Estates are spent in the Getting,</L>
<L>Since Women for Tea forsook spinning &amp; knitting,</L>
<L>And Men for Punch forsook hewing and spliting.</L></Q></P>
<P>If you would be wealthy, says he in another Al|manack,
think of saving, as well as of getting:
The Indies have not made Spain rich, because her
Outgoes are greater than her Incomes. Away
then with your expensive Follies, and you will not
have so much Cause to complain of hard Times,
heavy Taxes, and chargeable Families; for as Poor
Richard says,
<Q><L>Women and Wine, Game and Deceit,</L>
<L>Make the Wealth small, and the Wants great.</L></Q>
And farther, What maintains one Vice, would bring
up two Children. You may think, perhaps, that a
<PB N="10" REF="010619_0009_0F81B931D2AC78C8">
little Tea, or a little Punch now and then, Diet a
little more costly, Cloths a little finer, and a little
Entertainment, now and then, can be no great Mat|ter;
but remember what poor Richard says, Many
a little makes a Mickle; and farther, Beware of
little Expences. A small Leak will sink a great Ship.
And again, Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove.
And moreover, Fools make Feasts and wise Men
eat them.</P>
<P>Here you are all got together at this Vendue of
Fineries and Knicknacks. You call them Goods, but
if you do not take Care, they will prove Evils to some
of you. You expected they will be sold cheap, and per|haps
they may for less than they cost; but if you
have no Occasion for them, they must be dear to you.
Remember what poor Richard says, Buy what thou
hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Ne|cessaries.
And again, At a great Pennyworth pause
a while: He means, that perhaps the Cheapness is
apparent only, and not real; or the Bargain, by
straitning thee in thy Business, may do thee more Harm
than Good. For in another Place he says, Many have
been ruined by buying good Pennyworths. Again
poor Richard says, 'Tis foolish to lay out Money in
a Purchase of Repentance; and yet this Folly is prac|tised
every Day at Vendues, for want of min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="blotted">ing
the Almanack. Wise Men, as poor Dick says, learn
by others Harms, Fools scarcely by their own; but
`Felix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum&punc; Many a
One, for the Sake of Finery on the Back, have gone
<PB N="11" REF="010619_0010_0F81B9328EF10320">
with a hungry Belly, and half starved their Families.
Silks and Sattins, Scarlet and Velvets (as Poor Richard
says) put out the Kitchen fire. These are not the
Necessaries of Life, they can scarcely be called the
Conveniencies; and yet only because they look pretty,
how many want to have them. The artificial
Wants of Mankind thus become more numer|ous
than the natural; and, as Poor Dick says,
For one poor Person, there are an hundred indi|gent.
By these, and other Extravagancies, the
Genteel are reduced to Poverty, and forced to
borrow of those whom they formerly despised,
but who, through Industry and Frugality, have
maintained their Standing; in which Case it
appears plainly, that a Ploughman on his Legs
is higher than a Gentleman on his Knees, as Poor
Richard says. Perhaps they have had a small
Estate left them, which they knew not the Get|ting
of; they think 'tis Day and will never be
Night; that a little to be spent out of so much,
is never worth minding; (A Child and a Fool, as
Poor Richard says, imagine Twenty Shillings
and Twenty Years can never be spent) but, al|ways
taking out of the Meal-Tub and never put|ting
in, soon&punc; comes to the Bottom; then, as Poor
Dick says, When the Well's dry, they know the
Want of Water. But this they might have
known before, if they had taken his Advice.
If you would know the Value of Money, go and
try to borrow some; for, He that goes a borrow|ing
<PB N="12" REF="010619_0011_0F81B9339895E648">
goes a sorrowing; and indeed so does he that
lends to such People, when he goes to get it in a|gain.
&mdash;Poor Dick farther advises and says,
<Q><L>Fond Pride of Dress, is sure a very Curse.</L>
<L>E'er Fancy you consult, consult your Purse.</L></Q>
And again, Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want, and
a great deal more saucy. When you have bought
one fine Thing you must buy ten more, that your
Appearance may be all of a Piece; but Poor Dick
says, 'Tis easier to suppress the first Desire, than to
satisfy all that follow it. And 'tis as truly Folly
for the Poor to ape the Rich, as for the Frog to
swell in order to equal the Ox.
<Q><L>Great Estates may venture more,</L>
<L>But little Boats should keep near Shore.</L></Q>
'Tis however a Folly soon punished; for Pride that
dines on Vanity, sups on Contempt, as Poor Richard
says. And, in another Place, Pride breakfasted
with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and supped with
Infamy. And, after all, of what Use is this Pride
of Appearance, for which so much is risqued, so
much is suffered? It cannot promote Health, or
ease Pain; it makes no Increase of Merit in the
Person; it creates Envy, it hastens Misfortune.
<Q><L>What is a Butterfly? At best</L>
<L>He's but a Catterpillar drest,</L>
<L>The gaudy Fop's his Picture just;</L></Q>
as Poor Richard says.</P>
<P>But what Madness must it be to run in Debt for
these Superfluities! We are offered, by the Terms
<PB N="13" REF="010619_0012_0F81B9341227D3C0">
of this Vendue, Six Months Credit; and that per|haps,
has induced some of us to attend it, because
we cannot spare the ready Money, and hope now
to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you
do when you run in Debt: You give to another
Power over your Liberty. If you cannot pay at
the Time, you will be ashamed to see your Cred|itor;
you will be in Fear when you speak to him;
you will make poor, pitiful, sneaking Excuses,
and by Degrees come to lose your Veracity, and
sink into base downright Lying; for, as Poor
Richard says, The second Vice is Lying, the first is
running in Debt. And again, to the same Purpose,
Lying rides upon Debt's Back. Whereas a free|born
American ought not to be ashamed or afraid
to see or speak to any Man living. But Poverty
often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue.
'Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright, as Poor
Richard truly says. What would you think of
that Prince, or that Government, who should issue
an Edict forbidding you to dress like a Gentleman
or a Gentlewoman, on Pain of Imprisonment or
Servitude? Would you not say that you are free,
have a Right to dress as you please, and that such
an Edict would be a Breach of your Privileges,
and such a Government tyrannical? And yet you
are about to put yourself under that Tyranny, when
you run in Debt for such Dress! Your Creditor
has Authority, at his Pleasure, to deprive you of
your Liberty, by confining you in Goal for Life,
<PB N="14" REF="010619_0013_0F81B93530C1C408">
or to sell you for a Servant, if you should not be
able to pay him! When you have got your Bar|gain,
you may, perhaps, think little of Payment;
but Creditors (Poor Richard tells us) have better
Memories than Debtors; and in another Place says,
Creditors are a superstitious Sect, great Observes of
set Days and Times. The Day comes round before
you are aware, and the Demand is made before you
are prepared to satisfy it. Or if you bear your
Debt in Mind, the Term which at first seemed so
long, will, as it lessens, appear extremely short.
Time will seem to have added Wings to his Heels as
well as Shoulders. Those have a short Lent (saith
Poor Richard) who owe Money to be paid at Easter&punc;
Then since, as he says, The Borrower is a Slave to
the Lender, and the Debtor to the Creditor, disdain
the Chain, preserve your Freedom, and maintain
your Independency. Be industrious and free; be
frugal and free. At present perhaps you may think
yourself in thriving Circumstances, and that you
can bear a little Extravagance without Injury; but
<Q><L>For Age and Want save while you may,</L>
<L>No Morning-Sun lasts a whole Day.</L></Q>
as Poor Richard says.&mdash;Gain may be temporary and
uncertain, but ever while you live, Expence is con|stant
and certain; and 'tis easier to build two Chim|nies,
than to keep one in Fuel, as Poor Richard
says. So rather go to Bed supperless than rise in Debt.
<Q>Get what you can, and what you get hold;</Q>
'Tis the Stone that will turn all your Lead into Gold.
as Poor Richard says,</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010619_0014_0F81B935C7FB78E8">
And when you have got the Philosopher's Stone,
sure you will no longer complain of bad Times,
or the Difficulty of paying Taxes.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, my Friends, is Reason and Wis|dom;
but, after all, do not depend too much up|on
your own Industry, and Frugaliry, and Pru|dence,
though excellent Things, for they may all
be blasted without the Blessing of Heaven; and
therefore ask that Blessing humbly, and be not un|charitable
to those that at present seem to want it,
but comfort and help them. Remember Job suf|fered,
and was afterwards prosperous.</P>
<P>And now to conclude. Experience keeps a
School, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="missing"> Fools will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="missing">in no other, and
in that; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">or it is true, We may give Advice,
we cannot give Conduct, as Poor Richard says: How|ever,
remember this, They that won't be counsel|led,
can't be helped, as Poor Richard says: And
farther, that if you will not hear Reason she'll surely
rap your Knuckles.</P></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q></P>
<P>Thus the old Gentleman ended his Harangue.
The People heard it, and approved the Doctrine,
and immediately practised the Contrary, just as if
it had been a common Sermon; for the Vendue
opened, and they began to buy extravagantly&punc; not|withstanding
all his Cautions, and their own Fear
of Taxes.&mdash;I found the good Man had thoroughly
studied my Almanacks, and digested all I had dropt
on those Topicks during the Course of five-and

twenty Years. The frequent Mention he made of
me, must have tried any one else, but my Vanity
was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was
conscious that not a tenth Part of the Wisdom was
my own which he ascribed to me, but rather the
Gleanings I had made of the Sense of all Ages and
Nations. However, I resolved to be the better for
the Echo of it: and tho' I had at first determined
to buy Stuff for a new Coat, I went away resolved
to wear my old One a little longer. Reader, if
thou wilt do the same, thy Profit will be as great
as mine.</P>
