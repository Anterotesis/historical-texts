<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the State of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>TO understand political power right, and derive it from its original, we must consider what state all men are naturally in, and that is, a <HI>state of per|fect freedom</HI> to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man.</P>
<P>A <HI>state</HI> also <HI>of equality</HI> wherein all the power and ju|risdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another&punc; there being nothing more evident, than that creatures of the same species and rank, promiscuously born to all the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advantages of nature, and the use of the same fa|culties, should also be equal one amongst another with|out subordination or subjection, unless the lord and ma|ster of them all should, by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another, and confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.</P>
<P>This <HI>equality</HI> of men by nature, the judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> looks upon as so evident in itself, and beyond all question, that he makes it the foundation of that obliga|tion to mutual love amongst men, on which he builds the duties they owe one another, and from whence he derives the great maxims <HI>of justice</HI> and <HI>charity.</HI></P>

Lib. 1.</P>
<P>But though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be <HI>a state of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erty,</HI> yet <HI>it is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> state of licence</HI>? though man in that state have an uncon|troulable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, yet he has not liberty to destroy himself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it. The <HI>state of na|ture</HI> has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all <HI>equal and inde|pendent,</HI> no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions: for men being all the workman|ship of one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his business; they are his pro|perty, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties, sharing all in one community of nature, there connot be supposed any such <HI>subordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion</HI> among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one another's uses as the inferior ranks of creatures are for our's. Every one, as he is <HI>bound to preserve himself,</HI> and not to quit his station wilfully<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">punc; so by the like reason, when his own preservation comes not
<PB N="5" REF="012834_0004_0F8B405AA2AF2680">
in competition&punc; ought he, as much as he can, <HI>to preserve the rest of mankind,</HI> and may not, unless it be to do ju|stice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another.</P>
<P>And that all men may be restrained from inva|ding others rights, and from doing hurt to one another, and the law of nature be observed, which willeth the peace and <HI>preservation of all mankind,</HI> the <HI>execution</HI> of the law of nature is, in that state, put into every man's hands, whereby every one has a right to punish the trans|gressors of that law to such a degree, as may hinder its violation: for the <HI>law of nature</HI> would, as all other laws that concern men in this world, be in vain&punc; if there were no body that in the state of nature had a <HI>power to execute</HI> that law, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders. And if any one in the state of nature may punish another for any evil he has done, every one may do so: for in that <HI>state of perfect equality,</HI> where natu|rally there is no superiority or jurisdiction of one over another, what any may do in prosecution of that law, every one must needs have a right to do.</P>
<P>And thus, in the state of nature, <HI>one man comes by a power over another</HI>; but yet no absolute or arbitrary power, to use a criminal, when he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or boundless extravagancy of his own will; but only to retribute to him, so far as calm reason and conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his transgression, which is so much as may serve for <HI>reparation</HI> and <HI>restraint</HI>: for these two are the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call <HI>punishment.</HI> In transgressing the law of nature, the offender declares himself to live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which is that measure God has set to the actions of men, for their mutual security; and so he becomes dangerous to mankind, the tye, which it to se|cure them from injury and violence, being slighted and broken by him. Which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and safety of it, provided for by the law of nature, every man upon this score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general may re|strain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one, who hath
<PB N="6" REF="012834_0005_0F8B405B68604DC0">
transgressed that law, as may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his example others, from doing the like mischief. And in this case, and up|on this ground, <HI>every man hath a right to punish the of|fender, and be executioner of the law of nature.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but this will seem a very strange doctrine to some men: but before they condemn it, I desire them to resolve me, by what right any prince or state can put to death, or <HI>punish an alien,</HI> for any crime he commits in their country. It is certain their laws, by virtue of any sanction they receive from the promul|gated will of the legislative, reach not a stranger: they speak not to him, nor, if they did, is he bound to hear|ken to them. The legislative authority, by which they are in force over the subjects of that commonwealth, hath no power over him. Those who have the supreme power of making laws in <HI>England, France</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> are to an <HI>Indian,</HI> but like the rest of the world, men with|out authority: and therefore, if by the law of nature every man hath not a power to punish offences against it, as he soberly judges the case to require, I see not how the magistrates of any community can <HI>punish an alien</HI> of another country; since, in reference to him, they can have no more power than what every man naturally may have over another.</P>
<P>Besides the crime which consists in violating the law, and varying from the right rule of reason, whereby a man so far becomes degenerate, and declares himself to quit the principles of human nature, and to be a noxious creature, there is commonly <HI>injury</HI> done to some person or other, and some other man receives da|mage by his transgression: in which case he who hath received any damage, has, besides the right of punish|ment common to him with other men, a particular right to seek <HI>reparation</HI> from him that has done it: and any other person, who finds it just, may also join with him that is injured, and assist him in recovering from the offender so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he has suffered.</P>
<P>From these <HI>two distinct rights,</HI> the one of <HI>pu|nishing</HI> the crime <HI>for restraint,</HI> and preventing the like offence, which right of punishing is in every body; the other of taking <HI>reparation,</HI> which belongs only to the injured party, comes it to pass that the magistrate, who
<PB N="7" REF="012834_0006_0F8B405C2690C1C8">
by being magistrate hath the common right of punishing put into his hands, can often, where the public good de|mands not the execution of the law, <HI>remit</HI> the punish|ment of criminal offences by his own authority, but yet cannot <HI>remit</HI> the satisfaction due to any private man for the damage he has received. That, he who has suffered the damage has a right to demand in his own name, and he alone can remit: the damnified person has this pow|er of appropriating to himself the goods or service of the offender <HI>by right of self-preservation,</HI> as every man has a power to punish the crime, to prevent its being com|mitted again, <HI>by the right he has of preserving all man|kind,</HI> and doing all reasonable things he can in order to that end: and thus it is, that every man, in the state of nature, has a power to kill a murderer, both <HI>to deter</HI> others from doing the like injury, which no reparation can compensate, by the example of the punishment that attends it from every body, and also to secure men from the attempts of a criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule and measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath committed upon one, declared war against all mankind, and therefore may be destroyed as a <HI>lion</HI> or a <HI>tyger,</HI> one of those wild savage beasts, with whom men can have no society nor security: and upon this is grounded that great law of nature, <HI>Whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</HI> And <HI>Cain</HI> was so fully convinced, that every one had a right to destroy such a criminal, that after the murder of his brother, he cries out, <HI>Every one that findeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e shall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay me</HI>; so plain was it writ in the hearts of all mankind.</P>
<P>By the same reason may a man in the state of nature <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nish the lesser breaches</HI> of that law. It will per|haps be demanded, with death? I answer, each trans|gression may be <HI>punished</HI> to that <HI>degree,</HI> and with so much <HI>severity,</HI> as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the offender, give him cause to repent, and terrify others from doing the like. Every offence, that can be com|mitted in the state of nature, may in the state of nature be also punished equally, and as far forth as it may, in a commonwealth: for though it would be besides my pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|sent purpose, to enter here into the particulars of the law of nature, or its <HI>measures of punishment</HI>: yet it is certain there is such a law, and that too, as intelligible
<PB N="8" REF="012834_0007_0F8B405CE07090C0">
and plain to a rational creature, and a studier of that law, as the positive laws of commonwealths; nay, pos|sibly plainer; as much as reason is easier to be understood, than the fancies and intricate contrivances of men, fol|lowing contrary and hidden interests put into words: for so truly are a great part of the <HI>municipal laws</HI> of countries, which are only so far right, as they are found|ed on the law of nature, by which they are to be regula|ted and interpreted.</P>
<P>To this strange doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>in the state of nature every one has the executive power</HI> of the law of nature. I doubt not but it will be objected, that it is unreasonable for men to be judges in their own cases, that self-love will make men partial to themselves and their friends: and on the other side, that ill nature, pas|sion and revenge will carry them too far in punishing others; and hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow, and that therefore God hath certainly ap|pointed government to restrain the parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity and violence of men. I easily grant, that <HI>civil government</HI> is the pro|per remedy for the inconveniences of the state of nature, which must certainly be great, where men may be judges in their own case&punc; since it is easy to be imagined, that he who was so unjust as to do his brother an injury; will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it: but I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll desire those who make this objection, to remember that <HI>absolute monarchs</HI> are but men; and if government is to be the remedy of those evils, which necessarily follow from men's being judges in their own cases, and the state of nature is therefore not to be endured, I desire to know what kind of government that is, and how much better it is than the state of nature, where one man commanding a multi|tude, has the liberty to be judge in his own case, &amp; may do to all his subjects whatever he pleases, without the least liberty to any one to question or controul those who exe|cute his pleasure? and in whatsoever he doth, whether led by reason, mistake or passion, must be submitted to? much better it is in the state of nature, wherein men are not bound to submit to the unjust will of another: and if he that judges, judges amiss in his own, or any other case, he is answerable for it to the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>It is often asked as a mighty objection, <HI>where are,</HI> or ever were there any <HI>men in such a state of nature</HI>? To which it may suffice as an answer at present, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="9" REF="012834_0008_0F8B405D9EA12408">
since all princes and rulers of <HI>independent</HI> governments all through the world are in a state of nature, it is plain the world never was, nor ever will be, without numbers of men in that state. I have named all governors of <HI>in|dependent communities,</HI> whether they are, or are not, in league with others: for it is not every compact that put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an end to the state of nature between men, but only this one of agreeing together mutually to enter into one com|munity&punc; and make one body politic; other promises, and compacts, men may make one with another, and yet still be in the state of nature. The promises and bar|gains for truck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> between the two men in the desert island, mentioned by <HI>Garcilasso de la Vega,</HI> in his history of <HI>Peru</HI>; or between a <HI>Swiss</HI> and an <HI>Indian,</HI> in the woods of <HI>America,</HI> are binding to them, though they are perfectly in a state of nature, in reference to one another: for truth and keeping of faith belongs to men, as men, and not as members of society.</P>
<P>To those that say, there were never any men in the state of nature, I will not only oppose the authority of the judicious <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ker, Eccl.

<HEAD>Of the State of War.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>state of war</HI> is a state of <HI>enmity</HI> and <HI>destruction</HI>: and therefore declaring by word or action, not a passionate and hasty, but a sedate settled design upon another man's life, <HI>puts him in a state of war</HI> with him against whom he has declared such an inten|tion, and so has exposed his life to the other's power to be taken away by him, or any one that joins with him in his defence, and espouses his quarrel; it being reason|able and just, I should have a right to destroy that which threatens me with destruction: for, <HI>by the fundamental law of nature, man being to be preserved</HI> as much as pos|sible, when a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l cannot be preserved, the safety of the in|nocent is to be pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him, or has discovered an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mity to his being, for the same reason that he may kill a <HI>wolf</HI> or a <HI>lion</HI>; because such men are not under the ties of the common-law of reason, have no other rule, but that of force and violence, and so may be treated as beasts of prey, those dangerous and noxious creatures, that will be sure to destroy him whenever he falls into their power.</P>
<P>And hence it is, that he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power, does thereby <HI>put himself into a state of war</HI> with him; it being to be un|derstood as a declaration of a design upon his life: for I have reason to conclude, that he who would get me into his power without my consent, would use me as he pleased when he had got me there, and destroy me too when he had a fancy to it; for no body can desire to <HI>have me in his absolute power,</HI> unless it be to compel me by force to that which is against the right of my freedom, <HI>i. e.</HI> make me a slave. To be free from such force is the only security of my preservation; and reason bids me look on him, as an enemy to my preservation, who would take away that <HI>freedom</HI> which is the fence to it; so that he who makes an <HI>attempt to enslave</HI> me&punc; thereby puts himself into a state of war with me. He that, in the state of nature, <HI>would take away the freedom</HI> that belongs to any one in that state, must necessarily be supposed to have a design to take away every thing else, that <HI>freedom</HI> being the foundation of all the rest&punc; as he that, in the state of society, would take away the <HI>freedom</HI> belonging

Want of a com|mon judge with authority, pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s all men in a state of nature: force without right, upon a man's person, makes a state of war, both where there is, and is not, a common judge.</P>

<P>This <HI>freedom</HI> from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preser|vation, that he cannot part with it, but by what for|feits his preservation and life together: for a man not having the power of his own life, <HI>cannot,</HI> by compact, or his own consent, <HI>enslave himself</HI> to any one, nor put him|self under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he pleases.

children of men&punc;</HI> given it to mankind in common. But this being supposed, it seems to some a very great dif|ficulty, how any one should ever come to have a <HI>property</HI> in any thing: I will not content myself to answer, that if it be difficult to make out <HI>property,</HI> upon a supposi|tion that God gave the world to <HI>Adam,</HI> and his posterity in common, it is impossible that any man but one univer|sal monarch, should have any <HI>property</HI> upon a supposi|tion, that God gave the world to <HI>Adam,</HI> and his heirs in succession, exclusive of all the rest of his posterity. But I shall endeavour to shew, how men might come to have a <HI>property</HI> in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that without any express com|pact of all the commoners.</P>
<P>God who hath given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and convenience. The earth&punc; and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it natu|rally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private domi|nion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be <HI>a means to ap|propriate</HI> them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild <HI>Indian,</HI> who knows no inclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, <HI>i. e.</HI> a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</P>
<P>Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be com|mon to all men, yet every man has a <HI>property</HI> in his own <HI>person:</HI> this no body has any right to but himself. The <HI>labour</HI> of his body, and the <HI>work</HI> of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his <HI>labour</HI> with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his <HI>property.</HI> It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this <HI>labour</HI> something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this <HI>labour</HI> being the unquestionable property of the
<PB N="16" REF="012834_0015_0F8B40651F2D1440">
labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.</P>
<P>He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. That <HI>labour</HI> put a distinction between them and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one say, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus appro|priated, because he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his? Was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common? If such a consent as that was necessary, man had starved, notwith|standing the plenty God had given him. We see in <HI>commons,</HI> which remain so by compact, that it is the ta|king any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state nature leaves it in, which <HI>begins the property</HI>; without which the common is of no use. And the ta|king of this or that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners. Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my <HI>property,</HI> without the assignation or consent of any body. The <HI>labour</HI> that was mine&punc; removing them out of that common state they were in, hath <HI>fixed</HI> my <HI>property</HI> in them.</P>
<P>By making an explicit consent of every commoner, ne|cessary to any one's appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common, children or servants could not cut the meat, which their father or master had pro|vided for them in common, without assigning to every one his peculiar part. Though the water running in the fountain be every one's, yet who can doubt, but that in the pitcher is his only who drew it out? His <HI>labour</HI> hath taken it out of the hands of nature, where it was common&punc; and belonged equally to all her children, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath</HI> thereby <HI>appropriated</HI> it to himself.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012834_0016_0F8B4065ED88F3B0">Thus this law of reason makes the deer that <HI>Indian</HI>'s who hath killed it; it is allowed to be his goods&punc; who hath bestowed his labour upon it, though before it was the common right of every one. And amongst those who are counted the civilized part of mankind, who have made and multiplied pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tive laws to determine <HI>property,</HI> this original law of nature, for the <HI>beginning of property,</HI> in what was before common, still takes place; and by vir|tue thereof&punc; what fish any one catches in the ocean&punc; that great and still remaining common of mankind; or what ambergrise any one takes up here, is by the <HI>labour</HI> that removes it out of that common state nature left it in, <HI>made</HI> his <HI>property,</HI> who takes that pains about it.

<P>It will perhaps be objected to this, that if gathering the acorns, or other fruits of the earth, <HI>&amp;c</HI> makes a right to them, than any one may <HI>ingross</HI> as much as he will. To which I answer, Not so. The same law of nature&punc; that does by this means give us property, does also <HI>bound</HI> that <HI>property</HI> too. <HI>God has given us all things richly&punc;</HI> 1 Tim. vi.12. is the voice of reason confirmed by inspiration. But how far has he given it us? <HI>To en|j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</HI> As much as any one can make use of to any advan|tage of life before it spoils, so much he may by his labour fix a property in: whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others. Nothing was made by God for man to spoil or destroy. And thus, considering the plenty of natural provisions there was a long time in the world, and the few spenders; and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could ex|tend itself&punc; and ingross it to the prejudice of others; espe|cially keeping within the <HI>bounds,</HI> set by reason, of what might serve for his <HI>use</HI>; there could be then little room for quarrels or contentions about property so established.</P>
<P>But the <HI>chief matter of property</HI> being now not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fruits of the earth, and the beasts that subsist on it, but <HI>the earth itself</HI>: as that which takes in and carries with it all the rest&punc; I think it is plain, that <HI>property</HI> in that
<PB N="18" REF="012834_0017_0F8B40669E8C9268">
too is acquired as the former. <HI>As much land</HI> as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the pro|duct of, so much is his <HI>property.</HI> He by his labour does as it were&punc; inclose it from the common. Nor will it in|validate his right, to say every body else has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate&punc; he can|not inclose, without the consent of all his fellow-com|moners, all mankind. God, when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour&punc; and the penury of his condition required it of him. God and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, <HI>i. e.</HI> improve it for the benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was his own, his labour. He that in obedience to this command of God, subdued, till|ed and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it some|thing that was his <HI>property,</HI> which another had no title to, nor could without injury take from him.</P>
<P>Nor was this <HI>appropriation</HI> of any parcel of <HI>land,</HI> by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in effect, there was never the less left for others because of his inclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could think himself injured by the drinking of ano|ther man, though he took a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst&punc; and the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is perfectly the same.</P>
<P>God gave the world to men in common; but since he gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest conveni|encies of life they were capable to draw from it, it can|not be supposed he meant it should always remain com|mon and uncultivated. He gave it to the use of the in|dustrious and rational, (and <HI>labour</HI> was to be <HI>his title</HI> to it;) not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. He that had as good left for his im|provement, as was already taken up&punc; needed not complain, ought not to meddle with what was already improved by another's labour: if he did, it is plain he desired the benefit of another's pains, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h he had no right to, and not the ground which God had given him in common with others to labour on, and whereof there was as good left, as that already possessed, and more than he knew what to do with, or his industry could reach to.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012834_0018_0F8B40699FDCF3B0">It is true, in <HI>land</HI> that is <HI>common</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> or any other country, where there is plenty of people under go|vernment, who have money and commerce, no one can inclose or appropriate any part, without the consent of all his fellow-commoners; because this is left common by compact, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the law of the land, which is not to be violated. And though it be common, in respect of some men, it is not so to all mankind; but is the joint property of this country, or this parish. Besides, the remainder, after such inclosure, would not be as good to the rest of the commoners, as the whole was when they could all make use of the whole; whereas in the begin|ning and first peopling of the great common of the world, it was quite otherwise. The law man was under was rather for appropriating. God commanded, and his wants forced him to <HI>labour.</HI> That was his <HI>property</HI> which could not be taken from him where-ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we see are joined together. The one gave title to the other.

<P>The <HI>measure of property</HI> nature has well set by the ex|tent of men's <HI>labour and the conveniences of life:</HI> no man's labour could subdue&punc; or appropriate all; nor could his enjoyment consume more than a small part; so that it was impossible for any man, this way, to intrench upon the right of another, or acquire to himself a property, to the prejudice of his neighbour, who would still have room for as good, and as large a possession (after the other had taken out his) as before it was appropriated. This <HI>measure</HI> did confine every man's <HI>possession</HI> to a very mode|rate proportion, and such as he might appropriate to himself, without injury to any body, in the first a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the world, when men were more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their company, in the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n vast wilder|ness of the earth, than to be straitened for want of room to plant in.

<HI>America,</HI> we shall find that the <HI>possessions</HI> he could make himself, upon the <HI>measures</HI> we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to this day, prejudice the rest of mankind, or give them reason to complain, or think them|selves injured by this man's incroachment, though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corners of the world, &amp; do infinitely exceed the small number that was at the beginning. Nay&punc; the extent of <HI>ground</HI> is of so little value, <HI>without labour,</HI> that I have heard it affirmed&punc; that in <HI>Spain</HI> itself a man may be permitted to plough, sow and reap, without being disturbed, upon land he has no other title to, but only his making use of it. But, on the contrary, the inhabitants think themselves behol|den to him, who, by his industry on neglected, and con|sequently waste land, has increased the stock of corn, which they wanted. But be this as it will&punc; which I lay no stress on; this I dare boldly affirm, that the same <HI>rule of propriety, (viz.)</HI> that every man should have as much as he could make use of, would hold still in the world, without straitening any body; since there is land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabi|tants, had not the <HI>invention of money,</HI> &amp; the tacit agree|ment of men to put a value on it, introduced (by consent) larger possessions, and a right to them; which, how it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as done.

<P>This is certain, that in the beginning, before the desire of having more than man needed had altered the intrin|sic value of things, which depends only on their useful|ness to the life of man; or had <HI>ageed, that a little piece of yellow metal,</HI> which would keep without wasting or de|cay, should be worth a great piece of flesh&punc; or a whole heap of corn; though men had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to appropriate&punc; by their labour&punc; each one to himself, as much of the things of nature, as he could use: yet this could not be mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, nor to the prejudice of others, where the same plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry. To which let me add, that he who appropriates land to him|self by his labour, does not lessen, but increase the com|mon stock of mankind: for the provisions serving to the support of human life, produced by one acre of inclosed and cultivated land, are (to speak much within compass) ten times more than those which are yielding by an acre of land of an equal richness lying waste in common.

I have here rated the improved land very low, in making its pro|duct but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an hundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncul|tivated waste of <HI>America,</HI> left to nature, without any im|provement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many convenien|ces of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in <HI>De|vonshire,</HI> where they are well cultivated?</P>

<P>The same <HI>measures</HI> governed the <HI>possession of land</HI> too: whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could feed&punc; and make use of, the cattle and product was also h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. But if either the grass of his inclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of his plant|ing perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the earth, notwithstanding his inclosure, was still to be looked on as waste, and might be the possession of any other. Thus, at the beginning, <HI>Cain</HI> might take as much ground as he could till, and make it is own land, and yet leave enough to <HI>Abel</HI>'s sheep to feed on; a few acres would serve for both their possessions.

together, and built cities; and then, by consent, they came in time, to set out the <HI>bounds of their distinct territories,</HI> and agree on limits between them and their neighbours; and by laws within themselves, settled the <HI>properties</HI> of those of the same society: for we see, that in that part of the world which was first inhabited, and therefore like to best peopled, even as low down as <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s time, they wandered with their flocks, and their herds, which was their substance, freely up and down; and this <HI>Abraham</HI> did&punc; in a country where he was a stran|ger.

But when there was not room enough in the same place, for their herds to feed together, they by consent, as <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI> did, <HI>Gen.</HI> xiii.5. separated and en|larged their pasture, where it best liked them. And for the same reason <HI>Esau</HI> went from his father, and his bro|ther, and planted in <HI>mount Seir, Gen.</HI> xxxvi.6.</P>
<P>And thus, without supposing any private dominion, and property in <HI>Adam,</HI> over all the world, exclusive of all other men, which can no way be proved, nor any one's property be made out from it; but supposing the <HI>world</HI> given&punc; as it was, to the children of men <HI>in common,</HI> we see how <HI>labour</HI> could make men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for their private uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room for quarrel.</P>
<P>Nor is it so strange, as perhaps before consideration it may appear, that the <HI>property of labour</HI> should be able to overbalance the community of land: for it is <HI>labour</HI> in|deed that <HI>puts the difference of value</HI> on every thing; and let any one consider what the difference is between an acre of land planted with tobacco or sugar&punc; sown with wheat or barley, and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any husbandry upon it, and he will find that the improvement of <HI>labour makes</HI> the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very modest com|putation to say, that of the <HI>products</HI> of the earth useful to the life of man nine tenths are the <HI>effects of labour</HI>: nay, if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about them, what in them is purely owing to <HI>nature,</HI> and what to <HI>labour,</HI> we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundreths are wholly to be put on the account of <HI>labour.</HI></P>

<P>This shews how much numbers of men are to be pre|ferred to largeness of dominions; and that the increase of lands, and the right employing of them, is the great art of government: and that prince, who shall be so wise and godlike, as by established laws of liberty to secure protection and encouragement to the honest industry of mankind, against the oppression of power and narrowness of party, will quickly be too hard for his neighbours: but this by the by.

<P>From all which it is evident, that though the things of nature are given in common, yet man, by being master of himself, and <HI>proprietor of his own person, and the actions or labour of it, had still in himself the great foundation of property</HI>; and that, which made up the great part of what he applied to the support or comfort of his being, when invention and arts had improved the conveniencies of life, was perfectly his own, and did not belong in com|mon to others.</P>

common&punc; which remained a long while the far greater part, and is yet more than mankind makes use of. Men, at first, for the most part, contented to themselves with what unassisted nature offered to their necessities&punc; and though afterwards, in some parts of the world, (where the increase of people and stock, with the <HI>use of money,</HI> had made land scarce, and so of some value) the several <HI>communities</HI> settled the bounds of their distinct territories, and by laws within themselves regulated the properties of the private men of their society, and so <HI>by compact</HI> and agreement&punc; <HI>settled the property</HI> which labour and industry beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; and the leagues that have been made between several states and kingdoms, either expresly or tacitly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all claim and right to the land in the others pos|session, have, by common consent, given up their pre|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ces to their natural common right, which originally they had to those countries, and so have, by <HI>positive agree|ment, settled a property</HI> amongst themselves, in distinct parts and parcels of the earth; yet there are still <HI>great tracts of ground</HI> to be found, which (the inhabitants thereof not having joined with the rest of mankind, in the consent of the use of their common money) <HI>lie waste,</HI> and are more than the people who dwell on it do, or can make use of&punc; and so still lie in common; tho' this can scarce happen amongst that part of mankind that have consented to the use of money.</P>
<P>The greatest part of <HI>things really useful</HI> to the life of man, and such as the necessity of subsisting made the first commoners of the world look after, as it doth the <HI>Ameri|cans</HI> now, <HI>are</HI> generally things of <HI>short duration</HI>; such as, if they are not consumed by use, will decay and perish of themselves: gold, silver and diamonds, are things that fancy or agreement hath put the value on, more than real use, and the necessary support of life. Now of those good things which nature hath provided in common, every one had a right (as hath been said) to as much as he could use, and <HI>property</HI> in all that he could effect with his labor; all that his <HI>industry</HI> could extend to, to alter from the state nature had put it in was his. He that <HI>gathered</HI> a hundred bush<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls of acorns or apples, had thereby a <HI>property</HI> in them, they were his goods as soon as gathered. He was only to look&punc; that he used them before they spoiled, else he took more than his share, and robbed others. And indeed it was a foolish thing&punc; as well as dishonest, to hoard up more than
<PB N="26" REF="012834_0025_0F8B4071249B5680">
he could make use of. If he gave away a part to any body else, so that it perished not uselesly in his pos|session, these he also made use of. And if he also barter|ed away plums, that would have rotted in a week, for nuts that would last good for his eating a whole year, he did no injury; he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed not the common stock; de|stroyed no part of the portion of goods that belonged to others, so long as nothing perished uselesly in his hands. Again, if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with its colour; or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling pebble or a diamond, and keep those by him all his life, he invaded not the right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things as he pleased; the <HI>exceeding of the bounds of</HI> his <HI>just property</HI> not lying in the largeness of his possession, but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it.</P>
<P>And thus <HI>came in the use of money,</HI> some lasting thing that men might keep without spoiling, and that by mu|tual consent men would take in exchange for the truly useful, but perishable supports of life.</P>
<P>And as different degrees of industry were apt to give men possessions in different proportions, so this <HI>invention of money</HI> gave them the opportunity to continue and en|large them: for supposing an island, separate from all possible commerce with the rest of the world, wherein there were but an hundred families, but there were sheep, horses and cows, with other useful animals, wholsome fruits, and land enough for corn for a hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the island, either because of its commonness, or perishableness, fit to supply the place of <HI>money</HI>; what reason could any one have there to enlarge his possessions beyond the use of his family, and a plentiful supply to its <HI>consumption,</HI> either in what their own industry produced, or they could barter for like perishable&punc; useful commodities, with others? Where there is not some thing, both lasting and scarce, and so valuable to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oarded up, there men will be apt to en|large their <HI>possessions of land,</HI> were it never so rich, never so free for them to take: for I ask, what would a man value ten thousand, or an hundred thousand acres of ex|cellent <HI>land,</HI> ready cultivated, and well stocked too with cattle, in the middle of the inland parts of <HI>America,</HI> where he had no hopes of commerce with other parts of the world, to draw <HI>money</HI> to him by the sale of the pro|duct?

It would not be worth the inclosing, and we should see him give up again to the wild common of nature, whatever was more than would supply the conveniencies of life to be had there for him and his family.</P>
<P>Thus in the beginning all the world was <HI>America,</HI> and more so than that is now; for no such thing as <HI>mo|ney</HI> was any where known. Find out something that hath the <HI>use and value of money</HI> amongst his neighbours, you shall see the same man will begin presently to en|large his possessions.</P>
<P>But since gold and silver, being little useful to the life of man in proportion to food, raiment and carriage, has its <HI>value</HI> only from the consent of men, whereof <HI>labour</HI> yet <HI>makes,</HI> in great part, <HI>the measure,</HI> it is plain, that men have agreed to a disproportionate and unequal <HI>pos|session of the earth,</HI> they having, by a tacit and voluntary consent, found out a way how a man may fairly possess more land than he himself can use the product of, by re|ceiving in exchange for the overplus gold and silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any one; these metals not spoiling or decaying in the hands of the possessor. This partage of things in an inequality of pri|vate possessions, men have made practicable out of the bounds of society, and without compact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly agreeing in the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate the right of property, and the possession of land is deter|mined by positive constitutions.</P>
<P>And thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, without any difficulty, <HI>how labour could at first begin a title of property</HI> in the common things of nature, and how the spending it upon our uses bounded it. So that there could then be no reason of quarreling about title, nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it gave. Right and conveniency went together; for as a man had a right to all he could employ his labour upon, so he had no temp|tation to labour for more than he could make use of This left no room for controversy about the title, nor for incroachment on the right of others; what portion a man carved to himself, was easily seen; and it was use|less, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.</P>

<HEAD>Of Paternal Power.</HEAD>
<P>IT may perhaps be censured as an impertinent criti|cism, in a discourse of this nature, to find fault with words and names, that have obtained in the world: and yet possibly it may not be amiss to offer new ones, when the old are apt to lead men into mistakes, as this of <HI>pa|ternal power</HI> probably has done, which seems so to place the power of parents over their children wholly in the <HI>father,</HI> as if the <HI>mother</HI> had no share in it; whereas, if we consult reason or revelation, we shall find, she hath an equal title. This may give one reason to ask, whether this might not be more properly called <HI>parental power?</HI> for whatever obligation nature and the right of generati|on lays on children, it must certainly bind them equal to both the concurrent causes of it. And accordingly we see the positive law of God every where joins them toge|ther, without distinction, when it commands the obedience of children, <HI>Honour thy father and thy mother,</HI> Exod. xx.12. <HI>Whosoever curseth his father or his mother,</HI> Lev. xx.9. <HI>Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father.</HI> Lev. xix.3. <HI>Children, obey your parents,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Had but this one thing been well considered, without looking any deeper into the matter, it might perhaps have kept men from running into those gross mistakes, they have made, about this power of parents; which, however it might, without any great harshness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the name of absolute dominion, and regal authority, when under the title of <HI>paternal power</HI> it seemed appropriated to the fa|ther, would yet have founded but oddly, and in the very name shewn the absurdity, if this supposed absolute power over children had been called <HI>parental</HI>; and thereby have discovered&punc; that it belonged to the <HI>mother</HI> too: for it will but very ill serve the turn of those men, who con|tend so much for the absolute power and authority of the <HI>fatherhood,</HI> as they call it, that the mother should have any share in it; and it would have but ill supported the <HI>monarchy</HI> they contend for, when by the very name it ap|peared, that the fundamental authority, from whence they would derive their government of a single person only, was not placed in one, but two persons jointly.

<P><HI>Adam</HI> was created a perfect man, his body and mind in full possession of their strength and reason, and so was capable, from the first instant of his being to provide for his own support and preservation, and govern his actions according to the dictates of the law of reason which God had implanted in him. From him the world is peopled with his descendants, who are all born infants, weak and helpless, without knowledge or understand|ing: but to supply the defects of this imperfect state, till the improvement of growth and age hath removed them. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and after them all <HI>parents</HI> were, by the law of nature, <HI>under an obligation to preserve, nourish, and educate the children</HI> they had begotten; not as their own workmanship, but the workmanship of their own maker, the Almighty, to whom they were to be accountable for them.</P>

So that, however it may be mistaken, <HI>the end of law is</HI> not to abolish or restrain, but <HI>to preserve and enlarge freedom</HI>: for in all the states of created be|ings capable of laws, <HI>where there is no law, there is no freedom</HI>: for <HI>liberty</HI> is, to be free from restraint and vio|lence from others; which cannot be, where there is no law: but freedom is not, as we are told, <HI>a liberty for every man to do what be lists</HI>: (for who could be free, when every other man's humour might domineer over him?) but a <HI>liberty</HI> to dispose, and order as he lists, his person, actions, possessions, and his whole property, with|in the allowance of those laws under which he is, and therein not to be subject to the arbitrary will of another, but freely follow his own.</P>
<P>The <HI>power,</HI> then, <HI>that parents have</HI> over their chil|dren, arises from that duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their off-spring, during the imperfect state of childhood. To inform the mind, and govern the acti|ons of their yet ignorant nonage, till reason shall take its place, and ease them of that trouble, is what the chil|dren want, and the parents are bound to: for God ha|ving given man an understanding to direct his actions, has allowed him a freedom of will, and liberty of acting, as properly belonging thereunto, within the bounds of that law he is under. But whilst he is in an estate, where|in he has not <HI>understanding</HI> of his own to direct his <HI>will,</HI> he is not to have any <HI>will</HI> of his own to follow: he that <HI>understands</HI> for him, must <HI>will</HI> for him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo; he must pre|scribe to his will, and regulate his actions; but when he comes to the estate that made his <HI>father a freeman,</HI> the <HI>son is a freeman</HI> too.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="012834_0030_0F8B4076D207A190">This holds in all the laws a man is under, whether natural or civil.

A capacity of knowing that law; which is suppo|sed by that law, at the age of one and twenty years, and in some cases sooner. If this <HI>made</HI> the father <HI>free,</HI> it shall <HI>make</HI> the son <HI>free</HI> too. Till then we see the law allows the son to have no will, but he is to be guided by the will of his father or guardian, who is to understand for him. And if the father die, and fail to substitute a deputy in his trust; if he hath not provided a tutor, to govern his son, during his minority, during his want of understanding, the law takes care to do it; some other must govern him, and be a will to him, till he hath <HI>at|tained to a state of freedom,</HI> and his understanding be fit to take the government of his will. But after that, the father &amp; son are equally <HI>free</HI> as much as tutor &amp; pupil after nonage; equally subjects of the same law together, with|out any dominion left in the father over the life, liberty, or estate of his son, whether they be only in the state and under the law of nature, or under the positive laws of an established government.</P>

continued under the tuition and government of others, all the time his own understanding is uncapable of that charge.

<P>Thus we are <HI>born free,</HI> as we are born rational; not that we have actually the exercise of either: age, that brings one, brings with it the other too.

Pol. l. i. sect. 6. <HI>a man may be said to have attained so far the use of reason, as sufficeth to make him capab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of those laws whereby he is then bound to guide his actions: this is a great d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al more easy for sense to discern, than for any one by skill and learning to deter|mine.</HI></P>
<P>Common-wealths themselves take notice of, and allow, that there is a <HI>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e when men</HI> are to <HI>begin to act like freeman</HI>&punc; and therefore ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l that time require not oaths of fe|alty, or allegiance, or other public owning of, or submis|sion to the government of their countries.</P>
<P>The <HI>freedom</HI> then of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and liberty of acting ac|cording to his own will, is <HI>grounded on</HI> his having <HI>reason,</HI> which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by&punc; and make him know how far he is left to the freedom of his own will. To turn him loose to an unre|strained liberty, before he has reason to guide him, is not the allowing him the privilege of his nature to be free; but to thrust him out amongst brutes, &amp; abandon him to a state as wretched, and as much beneath that of a man, as their's. This is that which puts the <HI>authority</HI> into the <HI>parents</HI> hands to govern the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of their children. God hath made it their business <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> employ this care on their offspring, and hath placed in them suitable inclina|nations of tenderness and concern to temper this power, to apply it, as his wisdom designed it, to the children's good, as long as they should need to be under it.</P>
<P>But what reason can hence advance this care of the <HI>parents</HI> due to their off-spring into an <HI>absolute arbitrary dominion</HI> of the father, whose power reaches no farther, than by such a discipline, as he finds most effectual, to give such strength and health to their bodies, such vigour and rectitude to their minds, as may best fit his children to be most useful to themselves and others; and, if it be ne|cessary to his condition, to make them work, when they are able, for their own subsistence. But in this power the <HI>mother</HI> too has her share with the <HI>father.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, this <HI>power</HI> so little belongs to the <HI>father</HI> by any peculiar right of nature, but only as he is guardian of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s children, that when he quits his care of them, he loses
<PB N="34" REF="012834_0033_0F8B4078CD286C68">
his power over them, which goes along with their nou|rishment and education, to which it is inseparably annex|ed; and it belongs as much to the <HI>foster-father</HI> of an ex|posed child, as to the natural father of another. So little power does the bare <HI>act of begetting</HI> give a man over his issue; if all his care ends there, and this be all the title he hath to the name and authority of a father. And what will become of this <HI>paternal power</HI> in that part of the world&punc; where one woman hath more than one husband at a time? or in those parts of <HI>America,</HI> where, when the husband and wife part, which happens frequently, the children are all left to the mother, follow her, and are wholly under her care and provision? If the father die whilst the children are young, do they not naturally every where owe the same obedience to their <HI>mother,</HI> during their minority, as to their father were he alive? and will any one say, that the mother hath a legislative power over her children? that she can make standing rules, which shall be of perpetual obligation, by which they ought to regulate all the concerns of their property, and bound their liberty all the course of their lives? or can she inforce the observation of them with capital punish|ments? for this is the proper <HI>power of the magistrate,</HI> of which the father hath not so much as the shadow. His command over his children is but temporary, and reaches not their life or property: it is but a help to the weak|ness and imperfection of their nonage, a discipline necessary to their education: and though a <HI>father</HI> may dispose of his own possessions as he pleases, when his children are out of danger of perishing for want, yet <HI>his power</HI> extends not to the lives or goods, which either their own industry, or a another's bounty has made their's; nor to their liberty neither, when they are once arrived to the infranchise|ment of the years of discretion. The <HI>father</HI>'s <HI>empire</HI> then ceases, and he can from thence forwards no more dispose of the liberty of his son, than that of any other man: and it must be far from an absolute or perpetual jurisdic|tion, from which a man may withdraw himself, having li|cence from divine authority to <HI>leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife.</HI></P>
<P>But though there be a time when a <HI>child</HI> comes to be as <HI>free</HI> from subjection to the will and command of his father, as the father himself is free from subjection to the will of any body else, and they are each under no

other restraint, but that which is common to them both, whether it be the law of nature&punc; or municipal law of their country; yet this freedom exempts not a son from that <HI>honour</HI> which he ought, by the law of God and na|ture, <HI>to</HI> pay his <HI>parents.</HI> God having made the parents instruments in his great design of continuing the race of mankind, and the occasions of life to their children; as he hath laid on them an obligation to nourish&punc; preserve, and bring up their off-spring; so he has laid on the chil|dren a perpetual obligation of <HI>honouring their parents,</HI> which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shewn by all outward expressions, ties up the child from any thing that may ever injure or affront&punc; disturb or endanger, the happiness or life of those from whom he received his; and engages him in all actions of defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those, by whose means he entered into being, and has been capable of any enjoy|ments of life: from this obligation no state, no freedom can absolve children. But this is very far from giving parents a power of command over their children, or an authority to make laws and dispose as they please of their lives or liberties. It is one thing to owe honour, respect, gratitude and assistance; another to require an absolute obedience and submission. The <HI>honour due to parents,</HI> a monarch in his throne owes his mother; and yet this lessens not his authority, nor subjects him to her govern|ment.</P>
<P>The subjection of a minor places in the father a tem|porary government, which terminates with the minority of the child: and the <HI>honour due from a child,</HI> places in the parents a perpetual right to respect, reverence, sup|port and compliance too, more or less, as the father's care, cost, and kindness in his education, has been more or less. This ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and conditions of a man's life. The want of di|stinguishing these two powers&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> that which the father hath in the right of <HI>tuition,</HI> during minority, and the right of <HI>honour</HI> all his life, may perhaps have caused a great part of the mistakes about this matter: for to speak properly of them, the first of these is rather the privilege of children, and duty of parents, than any prerogative of paternal power. The nourishment and education of their children is a charge so incumbent on parent, for their children's good&punc; that nothing can absolve them f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om

taking care of it: and though the <HI>power of commanding and chastising</HI> them go along with it, yet God hath wo|ven into the principles of human nature such a tenderness for their off-spring, that there is little fear that parents should use their power with too much rigour; the ex|cess is seldom on the severe side, the strong byass of na|ture drawing the other way. And therefore God almigh|ty when he would express his gentle dealing with the <HI>Israelites,</HI> he tells them, that though he chastened them&punc; <HI>he chastened them as a man chastens his son,</HI> Deut. viii.5&punc; <HI>i. e.</HI> with tenderness and affection, and kept them under no severer discipline than what was absolutely best for them, and had been less kindness to have slackened. This is that power to which <HI>children</HI> are commanded <HI>obedience,</HI> that the gains and care of their parents may not be in|creased, or ill rewarded.</P>
<P>On the other side, <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>support,</HI> all that which gratitude requires to return for the benefits received by and from them, is the indispensible duty of the child, and the proper privilege of the parents. This is intended for the parents advantage, as the other is for the child's; though education, the parents du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y&punc; seems to have most power, because the ignorance and in|firmities of childhood stand in need of restraint and correction; which is a visible exercise of rule, and a kind of dominion. And that duty which is compre|hended in the word <HI>honour,</HI> requires less obedience, tho' the obligation be stronger on grown, than younger chil|dren: for who can think the command, <HI>Children obey your parents,</HI> requires in a man, that has children of his of his own, the same submission to his father, as it does in his yet young children to him; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by this pre|cept he were bound to obey all his father's commands, if, out of a conceit of authority, he should have the in|discretion to treat him still as a boy?</P>
<P>The first part then of <HI>paternal power,</HI> or rather duty, which is <HI>education,</HI> belongs so to the father, that it ter|minates at a certain season; when the business of edu|cation is over, it ceases of itself, and is also alienable before: for a man may put the tuition of his son in other hands; and he that has made his son an <HI>apprentice</HI> to another, has discharged him, during that time, of a great part of his obedience both to himself and to his mother. But all the <HI>duty of honour,</HI> the other part, re|mains

never the less entire to them; nothing can cancel that: i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is so inseparable from them both, that the fa|ther's authority cannot dispossess the mother of this right&punc; nor can any man discharge his son from <HI>honouring</HI> her that bore him. But both these are very far from a pow|er to make laws, and inforcing them with penalties, that may reach estate, liberty, limbs and life. The power of commanding ends with nonage; and though, after that, <HI>honour</HI> and respect, support and defence, and what|soever gratitude can oblige a man to, for the highest be|nefits he is naturally capable of, be always due from a son to his parents&punc; yet all this puts no scepter into the fa|ther's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd, no sovereign power of commanding&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> has no dominion over his son's property, or act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; nor any right, that his will should prescribe to his son's in all things; however it may become his son in many things, not very inconvenient to him and his family, to pay a deference to it.</P>
<P>A man may owe <HI>honour</HI> and respect to an antient, or wiserman; defence to his child or friend; reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and support to the distressed; and gratitude to a benefactor, to such a degree, that all he has, all he can do, cannot sufficiently pay it: but all these give no authority, no right to any one, of making laws over him from whom they are owing. And it is plain, all this is due not only to the bare title of father; not only because, as has been said, it is owing to the mother too; but because these obligations to parents, and the degrees of what is required of children&punc; may be varied by the different care and kindness, trouble and expence, which is often em|ployed upon one child more than another.</P>
<P>This sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws the reason how it comes to pass, that <HI>pa|rents in societies</HI> where they themselves are subjects, re|tain a <HI>power over their children,</HI> and have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much right to their subjection, as those who are in the state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ure. Which could not possibly be, if all political power w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re only paternal, and that in truth they were one and the same thing: for then, all paternal power bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he prince&punc; the subject could naturally have none of it.

<PB N="38" REF="012834_0037_0F8B407DE7C8E7F0">
that has parents, owes them as much filial duty and obe|dience, as the meanest of his subjects do to their's; and can therefore contain not any part or degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of that kind of dominion, which a prince or magistrate has over his subject.</P>
<P>Though the obligation on the parents to <HI>bring up</HI> their children, and the obligation on children to <HI>honour</HI> their parents, contain all the power on the one hand, and sub|mission on the other, which are proper to this relation, yet there is <HI>another power</HI> ordinarily <HI>in the father,</HI> whereby he has a tie on the obedience of his children; which tho' it be common to him with other men, yet the occasions of shewing it, almost constantly happening to fathers in their private families, and the instances of it elsewhere being rare, and less taken notice of, it passes in the world for a part of <HI>paternal jurisdiction.</HI> And this is the power men generally have to <HI>bestow their estates</HI> on those who please them best, the possession of the father being the expectation and inheritance of the children, ordinarily in certain pro|portions, according to the law and custom of each coun|try; yet it is commonly in the father's power to bestow it with a more sparing or liberal hand, according as the behaviour of this or that child hath comported with his will and humour.</P>
<P>This is no small tie on the obedience of children: and there being always annexed to the enjoyment of land, a submission to the government of the country, of which that land is a part; it has been commonly supposed that a <HI>fa|ther</HI> could <HI>oblige his posterity to that government,</HI> of which he himself was a subject, and that his compact held them; whereas, it being only a necessary condition annexed to the land, and the inheritance of an estate which is under that government reaches only those who will take it on that condition, and so is no natural tie or engagement, but a voluntary submission: for <HI>every man's children</HI> being by nature as <HI>free</HI> as himself, or any of his ancestors over were, may, whilst they are in that freedom, choose what society they will join themselves to, what commonwealth they will put themselves under. But if they will enjoy the <HI>inheritance</HI> of their ancestors, they must take it on the same terms their ancestors had it, and submit to all the condi|tions annexed to such a possession. By this power, indeed fathers oblige their children to obedience to themselves,

<P>To conclude then, tho' the <HI>father's power</HI> of command|ing extends no farther than the minority of his children, and to a degree only fit for the discipline and government of that age; and tho' that <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>respect,</HI> and all that which the <HI>Latins</HI> called <HI>piety,</HI> which they indispensibly owe to their parents all their life-time, and in all estates, with all that support and defence is due to them, gives the father no power of governing, <HI>i. e</HI> making laws and enacting penalties on his children; though by all this he has no dominion over the property or actions of his son: yet it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obvious to conceive how easy it was&punc; in the first ages of the world, and in places still, where the thinness of people gives families leave to separate into unpossessed quarters, and they have room to remove or plant them|selves in yet vacant habitations, for the <HI>father of the family</HI> to become the prince of <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is no improbable opinion therefore, which the archphi|losopher was of, that the chief person in every houshold was al|ways, as it were&punc; a king: so when numbers of housholds joined themselves in civil societies together, kings were the first kind of governors amongst them&punc; which is also, as it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emeth, the reason why the name of fathers continued still in them, who, of fathers, were made rulers; as also the ancient custom of governors to do as <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> and being kings, to exercise the office of priests, which fathers did at the first, gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w perhaps by the same occasion.

<P>Thus it was easy, and almost natural for children, by a tacit, and scarce avoidable consent, to make way for the <HI>father's authority and government.</HI> They had been accustomed in their childhood to follow his direction, and to ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r their little differences to him; and when they were men&punc; who fitter to rule them?

<P>Thus the natural <HI>fathers of families,</HI> by an insensible change, became the <HI>politic monarchs</HI> of them too: and

<P>GOD having made man such a creature, that in his own judgment, it was not good for him to be alone, put him under strong obligations of necessity, conveni|ence, and inclination to drive him into <HI>society,</HI> as well as fitted him with understanding and language to continue and enjoy it. The <HI>first society</HI> was between man and wife, which gave beginning to that between parents and children; to which, in time, that between master and servant came to be added: and though all these might, and commonly did meet together, and make up but one family, wherein the master or mistress of it had some sort of rule proper to a family; each of these, or all together, came short of <HI>political society,</HI> as we shall see, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we con|sider the different ends, ties, and bounds of each of these.</P>
<P><HI>Conjugal society</HI> is made by a voluntary compact be|tween man and woman; and tho' it consist chiefly in such a communion and right in one another's bodies as is ne|cessary to its chief end&punc; procreation; yet it draws with it mutual support and assistance, and a communion of interests too, as necessary not only to unite their care and affection, but also necessary to their common off spring, who have a right to be nourished, and maintained by them, till they are able to provide for themselves.</P>
<P>For the end of <HI>conjunction, between male and female,</HI> being not barely procreation, but the continuation of the

This rule, which the infinite wise mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath set to the works of his hands, we find the inferior creatures steadily obey.

The same is to be observed in all birds, (except some do|mestic ones, where plenty of food excuses the cock from feeding, and taking care of the young brood) whose young needing food in the nest, the cock and hen con|tinue mates, till the young are able to use their wing, and provide for themselves.</P>

<P>The <HI>society betwixt parents and chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dren,</HI> and the distinct rights and powers belonging respectively to them&punc; I have treated of so largely, in the foregoing chapter&punc; that I shall not here need to say any thing of it.

<P><HI>Master</HI> and <HI>servant</HI> are names as old as history, but given to those of far different condition; for a freeman makes himself a servant to another, by selling him, for a certain time, the service he undertakes to do, in exchange for wages he is to receive: and though this commonly puts him into the family of his master, and under the or|dinary discipline thereof; yet it gives the master but a temporary power over him, and no greater than what is contained in the <HI>contract</HI> between them. But there is another sort of servants, which by a peculiar name we call <HI>slaves,</HI> who being captives taken in a just war, are by the right of nature subjected to the absolute dominion and arbitrary power of their masters.

which, what resemblance soever it may have in its order, offices, and number too, with a little common-wealth, yet is very far from it, both in its constitution, power and end: or if it must be thought a monarchy, and the <HI>paterfamilias</HI> the absolute monarch in it, absolute monar|chy will have but a very shattered and short power, when it is plain, by what has been said before&punc; that the <HI>master of the family</HI> has a very distinct and differently limitted <HI>power,</HI> both as to time and extent, over those se|veral persons that are in it; for excepting the slave (and the family is as much a family, and his power as <HI>pater|familias</HI> as great, whether there be any slaves in his fa|mily or no) he has no legislative power of life and death over any of them, and none too but what a <HI>mistress of a family</HI> may have as well as he. And he certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y can have no absolute power over the whole <HI>family,</HI> who has but a very limitted one over every individual in it. But how a <HI>family,</HI> or any other society of men, differ from that which is properly <HI>political society,</HI> we shall best see, by considering wherein <HI>political society</HI> itself consists.</P>
<P>Man being born, as has been proved, with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the rights and privileges of the law of nature, equally with any other man, or number of men in the world, hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his property, that is, his life, liberty and estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men; but to judge of and punish the breaches of that law in others, as he is persuaded the offence deserves, even with death itself&punc; in crimes where the heinousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires it. But because no <HI>political society</HI> can be, nor subsist, without having in itself the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that society; there, and there only is <HI>political society,</HI> where every one of the members hath qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed this natural pow|er, resigned it up into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands of the community in all cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law established by it. And thus all private judg|ment of every particular member being excluded the community comes to be umpire, by settled standing rules indifferent, and the same to all parties; and by men ha|ving authority from the community, for the execution of those rules, decides all the differences that may happen between any members of that society concerning any

matter of right; and punishes those offences which&punc; any member hath committed against the society, with such penalties as the law has established: whereby it is ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to discern, who are, and who are not, in <HI>political society</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogether. Those who are united into one body, and have a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authorities to decide controversies between them, and punish offenders, are in <HI>civil society</HI> one with ano|ther: but those who have no such common people&punc; I mean on earth, are still in the state of nature, each being&punc; where there is no other, judge for himself, and executioner; which is, as I have before shewed it, the perfect <HI>state of nature.</HI></P>
<P>And thus the common-wealth comes by a power to set down what punishment shall belong to the several trans|gressions which they think worthy of it, committed a|mongst the members of that society, (which is the <HI>power of making laws</HI>) as well as it has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its members, by any one that is not of it, (which is the <HI>power of war and peace</HI>;) and all this for the preservation of the property of all the mem|bers of that society, as far as is possible. But though every man who has entered into civil society, and is become a member of any commonwealth&punc; has thereby quitted his power to punish offences, against the law of <HI>nature</HI>&punc; in prosecution of his own private judg|ment, yet with the judgment of offences, which he has given up to the legislative in all cases, where he can ap|peal to the magistrate, he has given a right to the com|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nwealth to employ his force, for the execution of the judgments of the commonwealth, whenever he shall be called to it; which indeed are his own judgments, they being made by himself, or his representative. And here|in we have the original of the <HI>legislative</HI> and <HI>executive power</HI> of civil society, which is to judge by standing laws, how far offences are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e punished, when committed within the commonweal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to determine, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> judgm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l on the present circum|stances of the fact&punc; how far injuries from without are to be vindicated; and in both these to employ all the force of all the members, when there shall be need.</P>
<P>Where ever therefore any number of men are so united into one society, as to quit every one his executive power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he law of nature, and to resign it to the public, there

And this <HI>puts men</HI> out of a state of na|ture <HI>into</HI> that of a <HI>common wealth,</HI> by setting up a judge on earth, with authority to determine all the controver|sies, and redress the injuries that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y happen to any member of the commonwealth; which judge is the le|gislative, or magistrates appointed by it.

<P>In <HI>absolute monarchies</HI> indeed, as well as other govern|ments of the world, the subjects have an appeal to the law, and judges to decide any controversies, and restrain any violence that may happen betwixt the subjects them|selves, one amongst another.

<P>But whatever flatterers may talk to amuse peoples un|derstandings, it hinders not men from feeling; and when they perceive, that any man, in what station soever, is ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the bounds of the civil society which they are of, and that they have no appeal on earth against any harm, they may receive from him, they are apt to think them|selves in the state of nature, in respect of him whom they find to be so; and to take care, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> soon as they can, to have that <HI>safety and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">curity in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vil society,</HI> for which it was first instituted, and for which only they entered into it.

<HEAD>Of the Beginning of Political Societies.</HEAD>
<P>MEN being, as has been said, by nature, all free, equal&punc; and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of ano|ther, without his own consent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty, and puts on the <HI>bonds of civil society,</HI> is by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community, for their com|fortable, safe, and peaceable living one amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater security against any, that are not of it. This any number of men may do, because it injures not the free|dom of the rest; they are left as they were in the li|berty of the state of nature. When any number of men have so <HI>consented to make one community or government,</HI> they are thereby presently incorporated, and make <HI>one body politic,</HI> wherein the <HI>majority</HI> have a right to act and conclude the rest&punc;</P>
<P>For when any number of men have, by the consent of every individual, made a <HI>community,</HI> they have there|by made that <HI>community</HI> one body, with a power to act as one body, which is only by the will and determina|tion of the <HI>majority</HI>: for that which acts any commu|nity, being only the consent of the individuals of it, and it being necessary to that which is one body to move one way; it is necessary the body should move that way whither the greatest force carries it, which is the <HI>consent of the majority</HI>: or else it is impossible it should act or
<PB N="52" REF="012834_0051_0F8B3F9E62579C58">
continue one body, <HI>one community,</HI> which the consent of every individual that united into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that consent to be conclu|ded by the <HI>majority.</HI> And therefore we see, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in as|semblies, impowered to act by positive laws, where no number is set by that positive law which impower<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, the <HI>act of the majority</HI> passes for the act of the whole, and of course determines, as having, by the law of nature and reason, the power of the whole.</P>
<P>And thus every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts him|self under an obligation, to every one of that society, to submit to the determination of the <HI>majority,</HI> and to be concluded by it; or else this <HI>original compact</HI>&punc; whereby he with others incorporates into <HI>one society,</HI> would sig|nify nothing, and be no compact, if he be left free, and under no other ties than he was in before in the Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of nature. For what appearance would there be of any compact? what new engagement if he were no farther tied by any decrees of the society, than he himself tho't fit, and did actually consent to? This would be still as great a liberty, as he himself had before his compact, or any one else in the state of nature hath, who may sub|mit himself, and consent to any acts of it if he thinks fit.</P>
<P>For if <HI>the consent of the majority</HI> shall not, in reason, be received as <HI>the act of the whole,</HI> and conclude every individual; nothing but the consent of every individu|al can make any thing to be the act of the whole: but such a consent is next to impossible ever to be had, if we consider the infirmities of health, and avocations of bu|siness, which in a number, though much less than that of a common-wealth, will necessarily keep many away from the public assembly.

<P>Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <HI>That there are no instances to be found in story, of a company of men independent, and equal one amongst another, that met together, and in this way began and set up a government.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly&punc; <HI>It is impossible of right, that men should do so, because all men being born under government, they are to submit to that, and are not at liberty to begin a new one.</HI></P>
<P>To the first there is this to answer, That it is not at all to be wondered, that <HI>history</HI> gives us but a very little account of <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, that lived together in the state of nature.</HI> The inconveniences of that condition, and the love and want of society&punc; no sooner brought any number of them together, but they presently united and incorporated, if they designed to continue together.

Government is every where antecedent to records, and letters seldom come in amongst a people till a long continuation of ci|vil society has, by other more necessary arts, provided for their safety, case, and plenty: and then they begin to look after the history of their founders, and search into their <HI>original,</HI> when they have outlived the memory of it: for it is with <HI>common-wealths</HI> as with particular persons, they are commonly <HI>ignorant of their own births and infancies</HI>: and if they know any thing of their <HI>ori|ginal,</HI>

they are beholden for it, to the accidental records that others have kept of it. And those that we have, of the beginning of any polities in the world, except|ing that of the <HI>Iews,</HI> where God himself immediately interposed, and which favours not at all paternal domi|nion, are all either plain instances of such a beginning as I have mentioned, or at least have manifest footsteps of it.</P>
<P>He must shew a strange inclination to deny evident matter of fact, when it agrees not with his hypothesis, who will not allow, that the <HI>beginning</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Ve|nice</HI> were by the uniting together of several men free and independent one of another, amongst whom there was no natural superiority or subjection. And if <HI>Iose|phus Acosta</HI>'s word may be taken, he tells us, that in many parts of <HI>America</HI> there was no government at all. <HI>There are great and apparent conjectures,</HI> says he, <HI>that these men,</HI> speaking of those of Peru, <HI>for a long time had neither kings nor common-wealths, but lived in troops, as they do this day in</HI> Florida, <HI>the</HI> Cheriquanas, <HI>those of</HI> Brasil, <HI>and many other nations, which have no certain kings, but as occasion is offered, in peace or war, they choose their captains as they please,</HI> l. i. c. 25. If it be said, that every man there was born subject to his father, or the head of his family; that the subjection due from a child to a father took not away his freedom of uniting into what political society he thought fit, has been al|ready proved. But be that as it will, these men, it is evident, were actually <HI>free</HI>; and whatever superiority some politicians now would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it not, but by consent were all <HI>equal,</HI> till by the same consent they set rulers over themselves. So that their <HI>politic societies</HI> all <HI>began</HI> from a voluntary union, and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the choice of their governors, and forms of govern|ment.</P>
<P>And I hope those who went away from <HI>Sparta</HI> with <HI>Palantus</HI>&punc; mentioned by <HI>Iustin,</HI> l. iii. c. 4. will be allowed to have been <HI>freemen independent</HI> one of another, and to have set up a government over themselves, by their own consent. Thus I have given several examples, out of history, of <HI>people free and in the state of nature,</HI> that being met together incorporated &amp; <HI>began a commonwealth.</HI> And if the want of such instances be an argument to prove
<PB N="55" REF="012834_0054_0F8B3FA2F7A53958">
that <HI>government</HI> were not, nor could not be so <HI>begun,</HI> I suppose the contenders for paternal empire were better let it alone&punc; than urge it against natural liberty: for if they can give so many instances, out of history, of <HI>governments begun</HI> upon paternal right, I think (though at best an argument from what has been, to what should of right be, has no great force) one might, without any great danger, yield them the cause. But if I might advise them in the case, they would do well not to search too much into the <HI>original of governments,</HI> as they have begun <HI>de facto,</HI> lest they should find, at the foundation of most of them, some|thing very little favourable to the design they promote, and such a power as they contend for.</P>
<P>But to conclude, reason being plain, on our side, that men are naturally free, and the examples of history shew|ing, that the <HI>governments</HI> of the world, that were begun in peace, had their beginning laid on that foundation, and were <HI>made by the consent of the people</HI>; there can be little room for doubt, either where the right is, or what has been the opinion, or practice of mankind, about the <HI>first erecting of governments.</HI></P>
<P>I will not deny, that if we look back as far as history will direct us, towards the <HI>original of common-wealths,</HI> we shall generally find them under the government and administration of one man. And I am also apt to be|lieve, that where a family was numerous enough to sub|sist by itself, and continued entire together, without mix|ing with others, as it often happens, where there is much land, and few people, the government commonly began in the father: for the father having, by the law of na|ture, the same power with every man else to punish, as he thought fit, any offences against that law, might thereby punish his transgressing children, even when they were men, and out of their pupilage; and they were very likely to submit to his punishment, and all join with him against the offender, in their turns, giving him there|by power to execute his sentence against any transgres|sion, and so in effect make him the law-maker, and go|vernor over all that remained in conjunction with his fa|mily. He was fittest to be trusted; paternal affection secured their property and interest under his care; and the custom of obeying him, in their childhood, made it easier to submit to him, rather than to any other. If therefore they must have one to rule them, as govern|ment
<PB N="56" REF="012834_0055_0F8B3FA3A41BD5E0">
is hardly to be avoided amongst men that live toge|ther; who so likely to be the man as he that was their common father; unless negligence, cruelty, or any other defect of mind or body made him unfit for it? But when either the father died, and left his next heir, for want of age, wisdom, courage, or any other qualities, less fit for rule; or where several families met, and consented to continue together; there, it is not to be doubted, but they used their natural freedom, to set up him, whom they judged the ablest, and most likely, to rule well over them. Conformable hereunto we find the people of <HI>A|merica,</HI> who (living out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">each of the conquering swords, and spreading domination of the two great em|pires of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI>) enjoyed their own natural freedom, though, <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teris paribus,</HI> they commonly pre|fer the heir of their deceased king; yet if they find him any way weak, or uncapable, they pass him by, and set up the stoutest and bravest man for their ruler.</P>
<P>Thus, though looking back as far as records give us any account of peopling the world, and the history of nations, we commonly find the <HI>government</HI> to be in one hand: yet it destroys <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t that which I am affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>beginning of politic society</HI> depends upon the consent of the individuals, to join into, and make one society; who, when they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of government they thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it. But this having given occasion to men to mistake, and think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat by nature government was monarchical, and belong|ed to the father, it may not be amiss here to consider, why people in the beginning generally pitched upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which though perhaps the father's pro-emin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cy might, in the first institution of some commonwealths, give a rise to, and place in the beginning, the power in one hand; yet it is plain that the reason, that continued the form of <HI>government in a single person,</HI> was not any regard, or respect to paternal authority; since all petty <HI>monar|chies,</HI> that is, almost all monarchies, near their original, have been commonly, at least upon occasion, <HI>elective.</HI></P>
<P>First then, in the beginning of things, the father's government of the childhood of those sprung from him, having accustomed them to the <HI>rule of one man,</HI> and taught them that where it was exercised with care and skill, with affection and love to those under it, it was sufficient to procure and preserve to men all the political

happiness they so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght for in society. It was no wonder that they should pitch upon, and naturally run into that form of government, which from their infancy they had been all accustomed to; and which, by experience, they had found both easy and safe, to which, if we add, that <HI>monarchy</HI> being simple, and most obvious to men, whom neither experience had instructed in forms of go|vernment, nor the ambition or insolence of empire had taught to beware of the encroachments of prerogative, or the inconveniences of absolute power, which monar|chy in succession was apt to lay claim to, and bring up|on them; it was not at all strange, that they should not much trouble themselves to think of methods of re|straining any exorbitances of those to whom they had given the au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hority over them&punc; and of balancing the power of government, by placi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g several parts of it in different hands. They had neither felt the oppression of tyrannical dominion, nor did the fashion of the age, nor their possessions, or way of living, (which afforded little matter for covetousness or ambition) give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it; and there|fore it is no wonder they put themselves into such a <HI>frame of government,</HI> as was not only, as I said, most obvious and simple, but also best suited to their present state and condition; which stood more in need of de|fence against foreign invasions and injuries, than of mul|tiplicity of laws. The equality of a simple poor way of living, confining their desires within the narrow bounds of each man's small property, made few controversies, and so no need of many laws to decide them, or variety of officers to superintend the process, or look after the execution of justice, where there were but few trespasses, and few offenders. Since then those, who liked one another so well as to join into society, cannot but be supposed to have some acquaintance and friendship to|gether, and some trust one in another; they could not but have greater apprehensions of others, than of one another: and therefore their first care and thought can|not but be supposed to be, how to secure themselves against foreign force. It was natural for them to put themselves under a <HI>frame of government</HI> which might best serve to that end, and chuse the wisest and bravest man to conduct them in their wars, and lead them out against their enemies, and in this chiefly be their <HI>ruler.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="012834_0057_0F8B3FA51FDA82B0">Thus we see, that the <HI>kings</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which is still a pattern of the first ages in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> whilst the inhabitants were too few for the country, and want of people and money gave men no tempta|tion to enlarge their possessions of land, or contest for wider extent of ground, are little more than <HI>generals of their armies</HI>; and though they command absolutely in war, yet at home and in time of peace they exercise very little dominion, and have but a very moderate so|vereignty, the resolutions of peace and war being ordi|narily either in the people, or in a council.

All which are so many testimonies against paternal sovereignty, and plainly prove, that it was not the natural right of the <HI>father</HI> descending to his heirs, that mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overnments in the beginning, since it was impossible, upon that ground, there should have been so many little kingdoms; all must have been but only one universal monarchy, if men had not been at <HI>liberty to se|parate</HI> themselves from their families, and the govern|ment, be it what it will, that was set up in it, and go and make distinct common-wealths and other governments as they thought fit.</P>
<P>This has been the practice of the world from its first beginning to this day; nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom of mankind, that they are <HI>born under con|stituted and ancient polities,</HI> that have established laws, and set forms of government, than if they were born in the woods, amongst the unconfined inhabitants, that run loose in them: for those, who would persuade us, that <HI>by being born under any government, we are naturally subjects to it,</HI> and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of nature, have no other reason (bating that of paternal power, which we have already answered) to produce for it, but only, because our fa|thers or progenitors passed away their natural liberty, and thereby bound up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government, which they themselves submitted to. It is true, that whatever en|gagements or promises any one has made for himself, he is under the obligation of them, but <HI>cannot,</HI> by any <HI>compact</HI> whatsoever, <HI>bind his children or posterity:</HI> for
<PB N="63" REF="012834_0062_0F8B3FA99F9E0268">
his son, when a man, being altogether as free as the fa|ther, any <HI>act of the father can no more give away the li|berty of the son,</HI> than it can of any body else: he may indeed annex such conditions to the land, he enjoyed as a subject of any common-wealth, as may oblige his son to be of that community, if he will enjoy those possessions which were his father's; because that estate being his fa|ther's property, he may dispose, or settle it, as he pleases.</P>
<P>And this has generally given the occasion to mistake in this matter; because common wealths not permitting any part of their dominions to be dismembered, nor to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enjoyed by any but those of their community, the son cannot ordinarily enjoy the possessions of his father, but under the same terms his father did, by becoming a member of the society; whereby he puts himself pre|sently under the government he finds there established, as much as any other subject of that common-wealth. And thus <HI>the consent of freemen, born under government,</HI> which only <HI>makes them members of it,</HI> being given se|parately in their turns, as each comes to be of age, and not in a multitude together; people take no notice of it, and thinking it not done at all, or not necessary, con|clude they are naturally subjects as they are men.</P>
<P>But, it is plain, <HI>governments</HI> themselves understand it otherwise; they claim <HI>no power over the son, because of that they had over the father</HI>; nor look on children as being their subjects, by their fathers being so. If a sub|ject of <HI>England</HI> have a child&punc; by an <HI>English</HI> woman in <HI>France,</HI> whose subject is he? Not the king of <HI>England</HI>'s; for he must have leave to be admitted to the privileges of it: nor the king of <HI>France</HI>'s; for how then has his father a liberty to bring him away, and breed him as he pleases? and who ever was judged as a <HI>traytor</HI> or <HI>deserter,</HI> if he left or warred against a count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, for being barely born in it of parents that were aliens there? It is plain then, by the practice of governments themselves, as well as by the law of right reason&punc; that <HI>a child is born a subject of no coun|try or government.</HI> He is under his father's tuition and au|thority, till he comes to age of discretion; and then he is a freeman, at liberty what government he will put himself under, what body politic he will unite himself to: for if an <HI>Englishman</HI>'s son&punc; born in <HI>France,</HI> be at liberty, and may do so, it is evident there is no tie upon him by his father's being a subject of this kingdom; nor is he bound
<PB N="64" REF="012834_0063_0F8B3FAAEFA816A8">
up by any compact of his ancestors. And why then hath not his son, by the same reason, the same liberty, though he be born any where else? Since the power that a fa|ther hath naturally over his children, is the same where|ever they be born, and the ties of natural obligations, are not bounded by the positive limits of kingdoms and com|monwealths.</P>
<P><HI>Every man</HI> being, as has been shewed, <HI>naturally free,</HI> and nothing being able to put him into subjection to any earthly power, but only his own <HI>consent</HI>; it is to be con|sidered, what shall be understood to be a <HI>sufficient de|claration</HI> of a man's <HI>consent, to make him subject</HI> to the laws of any government. There is a common distinction of an express and a tacit consent, which will concern our present case. No body doubts but an express <HI>consent,</HI> of any man entering into any society, makes him a perfect member of that society, a subject of that government. The difficulty is, what ought to be looked upon as a <HI>tacit consent,</HI> and how far it binds, <HI>i. e.</HI> how far any one shall be looked on to have consented, and thereby submitted to any government, where he has made no expressions of it at all. And to this I say, that every man that hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth thereby give his <HI>tacit consent,</HI> &amp; is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that govern|ment, during such enjoyment, as any one under it; whe|ther this his possession be of land, to him and his heirs for ever, or a lodging only for a week; or whether it be barely travelling freely on the highway; and in effect, it reaches as far as the very being of any one within the territories of that government.</P>
<P>To understand this the better, it is fit to consider, that every man, when he at first incorporates himself in|to any commonwealth he, by his uniting himself there|unto, annexed also, and submits to the community, those possessions, which he has, or shall acquire, that do not already belong to any other government: for it would be a direct contradiction, for any one to enter into society with others for the securing and regulating of property; and yet to suppose his land, whose property is to be regulated by the laws of the society, should be exempt from the jurisdicton of that government, to which he himself, the proprietor of the land, is a subject. By the same act therefore, whereby any one unites his per|son,
<PB N="65" REF="012834_0064_0F8B3FAB9BE641F8">
which was before free, to any commonwealth; by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word"> he u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">es his possessions, which were before free, to it also: and they bec<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">me both of them, person and possessions subject to the government and dominion of that commonwealth, as long as it hath a being.

<P>But since the government has a direct jurisdicton only over the land, and reaches the possessor of it, (before he has actually incorporated himself in the society) only as he dwells upon, and enjoys that: the obligation any one is under, by virtue of such enjoyment, to <HI>submit to the government, begins and ends with the enjoyment</HI>; so that whenever the owner who has given nothing but such a <HI>tacit consent</HI> to the government, will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said possession, he is at liberty to go and incorpotate himself into any other commonwealth; or to agree with others to begin a new one <HI>in vacuis locis,</HI> in any part of the world they can find free &amp; unpossessed: whereas he, that has once&punc; by actual agreement, and any <HI>express</HI> declaration, given his consent to be of any common|wealth, is perpetually and indispensibly obliged to be&punc; and remain unalterably a subject to it, &amp; can never be again in the liberty of the state of nature; unless by any calamity, the government he was under comes to be dissolved; or else by some public act cuts him off from being any longer a member of it</P>
<P>But submitting to the laws of any country, living qui|etly, and enjoying privileges and protection under them&punc; <HI>makes not a man a member of that society</HI>: this is only a local protection &amp; homage due to and from all those, who, not be|ing in a state of war, come within the territories belongi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">g to any government, to all parts whereof the force of its laws extends. But this no more <HI>makes a man a member of that society,</HI> a perpetual subject of that common-wealth, than it would make a man a subject to another in whose family he found it convenient to abide for some time; though, whilst he continued in it, he were obliged to comply with the laws, and submit to the government he found there. And thus we see, that <HI>foreigners,</HI> by living

<HEAD>Of the Ends of Political Society &amp; Government.</HEAD>
<P>IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions&punc; equal to the greatest&punc; and subject to no body, why will he part with his freed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m? why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and controul of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y exposed to the invasion of others: for all be|ing kings as much as he every man is equal, and the greater part no st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ict observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs of equity and justice, the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of the property he has in this state is very un|safe very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, which, however free, is full of fears and conti|nual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out&punc; and is willing to join in society with others&punc; who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual <HI>preservation</HI> of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, <HI>property.</HI></P>
<P>The great and <HI>chief end</HI>&punc; therefore, of men's uniting into common wealths&punc; and putting themselves under go|vernment, <HI>is the preservation of their property.</HI> To which in the state of nature there are many things wanting.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>&punc; There wants an <HI>established,</HI> settled, known <HI>law,</HI> re|ceived &amp; allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong&punc; and the common measure to decide all controversies between them: for though the law of na|ture be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures; yet men being biassed by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a law
<PB N="67" REF="012834_0066_0F8B3FAC9FA7ED78">
binding to them in the application of it to their particu|lar cases.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In the state of nature there wants <HI>a known and indifferent judge,</HI> with authority to determine all differen|ces according to the established law: for every one in that state being both judge and executioner of the law of na|ture, men being partial to themselves, passion and re|venge is very apt to carry them too far, and with too much heat, in their own cases; as well as negligence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nconcernedness, to make them too remiss in other men's.</P>
<P><HI>Third<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> In the state of nature there often wants <HI>power</HI> to back and support the sentence when right, and to <HI>give</HI> it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>execution.</HI> They who by any injustice of|fended, will seldom fail, where they are able, by force to make good their injustice; such resistance many times makes the punishment dangerous, and frequently destruc|tive, to those who attempt it.</P>
<P>Thus mankind&punc; notwithstanding all the privileges of the state of nature, being but in an ill condition, while they remain in it, are quickly driven into society. Hence it comes to pass&punc; that we seldom find any number of men live any time together in this state. The inconveniences that they are therein exposed to, by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the power every man has of punish|ing the transgressions of others, make them take sanctuary under the established laws of government&punc; and therein seek <HI>the preservation of their property.</HI> It is this makes the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> so willingly give up every on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his single power of punishing, to be exercised by such alone, as shall be ap|pointed to it among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them; and by such rules as the community, or those authorized by them to that purpose, shall agree on. And in this we have the original <HI>right and rise of both the legislative and executive power,</HI> as well as of the governments and societies themselves.</P>
<P>For in the state of nature, to omit the liberty he has of innocent delights, a man has two powers.</P>
<P>The first is to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the pre|servation of himself, and others within the permission of the <HI>law of nature</HI>: by which law, common to them all&punc; he and all the rest of <HI>mankind are one community,</HI> make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty, distinct from all other creatures. And were it not for the corruption and viciousness of degene|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e men&punc; there would be no need of any other&punc; no ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ssity that men should separate from this great and natu|ral
<PB N="68" REF="012834_0067_0F8B3FAD67399488">
community, and by positive agreements combine into smaller and divided associations.</P>
<P>The other power a man has in the state of nature, is the <HI>power to punish the crimes</HI> committed against that law. Both these he gives up, when he joins in a private, if I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o call it, or particular politic society, and incorpo|rates into any common wealth, separate from the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>The first <HI>power,</HI> viz. <HI>of doing whatsoever he thought for the preservation of himself,</HI> and the rest of mankind, <HI>he gives up</HI> to be regulated by laws made by the society, so far forth as the preservation of himself, and the rest of that society shall require; which laws of the society in many things confine the liberty he had by the law of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>power of punishing he wholly gives up,</HI> and engages his natural force&punc; (which he might before em|ploy in the execution of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of nature, by his own single authority, as he thought fit) to assist the executive power of the society, as the law thereof shall r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quire: for being now in a new state, wherein he is to enjoy ma|ny conveniences, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he labour, assistance, and society of others in the same community, as well as protection from its whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trength; he is to part also with as much of his natural liberty, in providing for himself, as the good&punc; prosperity, and safety of the society shall require; which is not only necessary&punc; but just, since the other mem|bers of the society do the like.</P>
<P>But though men, when they enter into society, give up the equality, lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rty and executive power they had in the state of nature, into the hands of the society, to be so far di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">posed of by the legislative, as the good of the so|ciety sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll require; yet it being only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself, his liberty and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perty; (for no rational creature can be supposed to change his condition with an intention to be worse) the power of the socie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y&punc; or <HI>legislative</HI> constituted by them, can <HI>never be supposed to extend farther than the common good</HI>; but is obliged to secure every one's property, by providing against th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se three defects above-mentioned, that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy.

<P>THE majority having, as has been shewed, upon men's first uniting into society, the whole power of the community naturally in them, may employ all that power in making laws for the community from time to time, and executing those laws by officers of their own appointing; and then the <HI>form</HI> of the government is a perfect <HI>demo|cracy</HI>: or else may put the power of making laws into the hands of a few select men, and their heirs or succes|sors; and then it is an <HI>oligarchy</HI>: or else into the hands of one man, and then it is a <HI>monarchy</HI>: if to him and his heirs, it is an <HI>hereditary monarchy</HI>: if to him only for life, but upon his death the power only of nominating a suc|cessor to return to them; an <HI>elective monarchy.</HI> And so accordingly of these the community may make compoun|ded and mixed forms of government, as they think good.

Hence it is, that the controversies that happen between any man of the society with those that are out of it, are managed by the public; and an injury done to a member of their body, engages the whole in the reparation of it.

<P>This therefore contains the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and all the transactions, with all persons and communities without the common-wealth, and may be called <HI>federative,</HI> if any one pleases. So the thing be understood, I am indifferent as to the name.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Subordination of the Powers of the Common-wealth.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH in a constituted common-wealth, standing upon its own basis, and acting according to its own nature, that is, acting for the preservation of the community, there can be but <HI>one supreme power,</HI> which is <HI>the legislative,</HI> to which all the rest are and must be subordinate, yet the legislative being only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iduciary power to act for certain ends, there remains still <HI>in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative,</HI> when they find the <HI>legislative</HI> act contrary to the trust re|posed in them: for all <HI>power given with trust</HI> for the at|taining an <HI>end,</HI> being limitted by that end, whenever that <HI>end</HI> is manifestly neglected, or opposed, the <HI>trust</HI> must necessarily be <HI>forfeited,</HI> and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it, who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security. And thus the <HI>community</HI> perpetually <HI>retains a supreme power</HI> of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the subject: for no man or society of men&punc; having a power to deliver up their <HI>preservation,</HI> or consequently the means of it, to the ab|solute will and arbitrary dominion of another&punc; when ever any one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition, they will always have a right to pre|serve, what they have not a power to part with; and to rid themselves of those, who invade this fundamental, sa|cred, and unalterable law of <HI>self-preservation,</HI> for which they entered into society. And thus the <HI>community</HI> may be said in this respect to be <HI>always the supreme power,</HI> but not as considered under any form of government, because this power of the people can never take place till the go|vernment be dissolved.</P>
<P>In all cases, whilst the government subsists, the <HI>legis|lative is the supreme power</HI>: for what can give laws to another, must needs be superior to him; and since the legislative is no otherwise legislative of the society, but by the right it has to make laws for all the parts, and for every member of the society, prescribing rules to their actions, and giving power of execution, where they are transgressed, the <HI>legislative</HI> must needs be the

<HI>supreme,</HI> and all other powers, in any members or parts of the society, derived from and subordinate to it.</P>
<P>In some common-wealths, where the <HI>legislative</HI> is not always in being, and the <HI>executive</HI> is vested in a single person, who has also a share in the legislative: there that single person in a very tolerable sense may also be called <HI>supreme</HI>: not that he has in himself all the supreme power, which is that of law-making; but because he has in him the <HI>supreme execution,</HI> from whom all inferior ma|gistrates derive all their several subordinate powers, or at least the greatest part of them: having also no legis|lative superior to him&punc; there being no law to be made without his consent, which cannot be expected&punc; should ever subject him to the other part of the legislative, <HI>he</HI> is pro|perly enough in this sense <HI>supreme.</HI> But yet it is to be observed, that though <HI>oaths of allegiance</HI> and fealty are taken to him, it is not to him as supreme legislator, but as <HI>supreme executor</HI> of the law, made by a joint power of him with others; <HI>allegiance</HI> being nothing but an <HI>obedience according to law,</HI> which when he violates, he has no right to obedience, nor can claim it otherwise than as the public person vested with the power of the law, and so is to be considered as the image, phantom, or re|presentative of the common-wealth, acted by the will of the society, declared in its laws; and thus he has no will, no power, but that of the law. But when he quits this representation, this public will, and acts by his own pri|vate will, he degrades himself, and is but a single pri|vate person without power, and without will, that has any right to <HI>obedience</HI>; the members owing no <HI>obedience</HI> but to the public will of the society.</P>
<P>The <HI>executive power,</HI> placed any where but in a per|son that has also a sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the legislative, is visibly sub|ordinate and accountable to it, and may be at pleasure changed and displaced; so that it is not the <HI>supreme executive power,</HI> that is exempt from <HI>subordination,</HI> but the <HI>supreme executive power</HI> vested in one, who having a share in the legislative, has no distinct superior legisla|tive to be subordinate and accountable to, farther than he himself shall join and consent; so that he is no more subordinate than he himself shall think fit, which one may certainly conclude will be but very little.

The same holds also in regard of the <HI>federative</HI> power&punc; that and the <HI>executive</HI> being both <HI>ministerial</HI> and <HI>sub|ordinate to the legislative,</HI> which, as has been shewed, in a constituted common-wealth is the supreme. The <HI>le|gislative</HI> also in this case being supposed to consist of se|veral persons, (for if it be a single person, it cannot but be always in being, and so will, as supreme&punc; naturally have the supreme executive power, together with the le|gislative) may <HI>assemble, and exercise their legislature,</HI> at the times that either their orignal constitution&punc; or their own adjournment, appoints, or when they please; if neither of these hath appointed any time, or there be no other way prescribed to convoke them: for the su|preme power being placed in them by the people, it is always in them, and they may exercise it when they please, unless by their original constitution they are li|mited to certain seasons, or by an act of their supreme power they have adjourned to a certain time; and when that time comes, they have a right to <HI>assemble</HI> and act again.</P>
<P>If the <HI>legislative,</HI> or any part of it, be made up of <HI>repre|sentatives</HI> chosen for that time by the people, which af|terwards return into the ordinary state of subjects, and have no share in the legislature but upon a new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; this power of chusing must also be exercised by the peo|ple&punc; either at certain appointed seasons, or else when they are summoned to it; and in this latter case, the power
<PB N="82" REF="012834_0081_0F8B3FBB87F18DD8">
of convoking the legislative is ordinarily placed in the executive, and has one of these two limitations in respect of time: that either the original constitution requires their <HI>assembling</HI> and acting at certain intervals, and then the executive power does nothing but ministerially issue direc|tions for their electing and assembling, according to due forms; or else it is left to his prudence to call them by new elections, when the occasions or exigencies of the public require the amendment of old, or making of new laws, or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies, that lie on, or threaten the people.</P>
<P>It may be demanded here, What if the executive pow|er, being possessed of the force of the common-wealth, shall make use of that force to hinder the <HI>meeting</HI> and <HI>acting of the legislative,</HI> when the original constitution, or the public exigencies require it? I say, using force upon the people without authority, and contrary to the trust put in him that does so, is a state of war with the people&punc; who have a right to <HI>reinstate</HI> their <HI>legislative in the exercise</HI> of their power: for having erected a legislative, with an intent they sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld exercise the power of making laws&punc; ei|ther at certain set times, or when there is need of it, when they are hindered by any force from what is so necessary to the society, and wherein the safety and preservation of the people consists, the people have a right to remove it by force In all states and conditions, the true remedy of <HI>force</HI> without authority, is to oppose <HI>force</HI> to it. The use of <HI>force</HI> without authority, always puts him that uses it into a <HI>state of war,</HI> as the aggressor, and renders him liable to be treated accordingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>power of assembling and dismissing the legislative,</HI> placed in the executive, gives not the executive a superi|ority over it, but is a fiduciary trust placed in him, for the safety of the people, in a case where the uncertainty and variableness of human affairs could not bear a steady fixed rule: for it not being possible, that the first fra|mers of the government should, by any foresight, be so much masters of future events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and duration to the <HI>assemblie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the le|gislative,</HI> in all times to come, that might exactly answer all the exigencies of the common wealth; the best reme|dy could be found for this defect, was to trust this to the prudence of one who was always to be present, and whose business it was to watch over the public good.

<P>Things of this world are in so constant a flux, that no|thing remains long in the same state.

<HEAD>Of PREROGATIVE.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE the legislative and executive power are in distinct hands, (as they are in all moderated mo|narchies, and well-framed governments) there the good of the society requires, that several things should be left to the discretion of him that has the executive power: for the legislators not being able to foresee, and provide by laws, for all that may be useful to the community, the executor of the laws, having the power in his hands, has by the common law of nature a right to make use of it for the good of the society, in many cases, where the municipal law has given no direction, till the legislative can conveniently be assembled to provide for it. Many things there are, which the law can by no means provide for; and those must necessarily be left to the discretion of him that has the executive power in his hands, to be or|dered by him as the public good and advantage shall re|quire: nay, it is fit that the laws themselves should in some cases give way to the executive power, or rather to this fundamental law of nature and government, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="012834_0085_0F8B3FBDE09A5FE0">
That as much as may be, <HI>all</HI> the members of the society are to be preserved; for since many accidents may hap|pen, wherein a strict and rigid observation of the laws may do harm; (as not to pull down an innocent man's house to stop the fire, when the next to it is burning) and a man may come sometimes within the reach of the law, which makes no distinction of persons, by an action that may deserve reward and pardon; 'tis fit the ruler should have a power, in many cases, to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igate the severity of the law, and pardon some offenders: for the <HI>end of go|vernment</HI> being <HI>the preservation of all,</HI> as much as may be, even the guilty are to be spared, where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent.</P>
<P>This power to act according to discretion, for the pub|lic good, without the prescription of the law, and some|times even against it, <HI>is</HI> that which is called <HI>prerogative:</HI> for since in some governments the law making power is not always in being, and is usually too numerous, and so too slow, for the dispatch requisite to execution; and be|cause also it is impossible to foresee, and so by laws to provide for, all accidents and necessities that may concern the public, or to make such laws as will do no harm, if they are executed with an inflexible rigour, on all occasi|ons, and upon all persons that may come in their way; therefore there is a latitude left to the executive power, to do many things of choice which the laws do not pre|scribe.</P>
<P>This power, whilst employed for the benefit of the com|munity, and suitably to the trust and ends of the govern|ment, <HI>is undoubted prerogative,</HI> and never is questioned: for the people are very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point; they are far from examining <HI>prerogative,</HI> whilst it is in any tolerable degree employed for the use it was meant, that is, for the good of the people, and not manifestly against it: but if there comes to be a <HI>question</HI> between the executive power and the people, about a thing claimed as a <HI>prerogative</HI>; the tendency of the exercise of such <HI>prerogative</HI> to the good or hurt of the people, will easily decide that question.</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive, that in the infancy of govern|ments, when common-wealths differed little from fami|lies in number of people, they differed from them too but little in number of laws: and the governors, being as the fathers of them, watching over them for their
<PB N="87" REF="012834_0086_0F8B3FBED69EEC90">
good, the government was almost all <HI>prerogative.</HI> A few established laws served the turn, and the discretion and care of the ruler supplied the rest. But when mis|take or flattery prevailed with weak princes to make use of this power for private ends of their own, and not for the public good, the people were fain by express laws to get prerogative determined in those points wherein they found disadvantage from it: and thus declared <HI>limita|tions of prerogative</HI> were by the people found necessary in cases which they and their ancestors had left, in the utmost latitude, to the wisdom of those princes who made no other but a right use of it, that is, for the good of their people.</P>
<P>And therefore they have a very wrong notion of go|vernment, who say, that the people have <HI>incroached up|on the prerogative,</HI> when they have got any part of it to be defined by positive laws: for in so doing they have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right be|longed to him, but only declared, that that power which they indefinitely left in his or his ancestors hands, to be exercised for their good, was not a thing which they intended him when he used it otherwise: for the end of government being the good of the community, what|soever alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an <HI>incroachment</HI> upon any body, since no body in government can have a right tending to any other end: and those only are <HI>incroachments</HI> which prejudice or hin|der the public good. Those who say otherwise, speak as if the prince had a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community, and was not made for it; the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments. And indeed, if that be so, the people under his govern|ment are not a society of rational creatures, entered in|to a community for their mutual good; they are not such as have set rulers over themselves, to guard, and promote that good; but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a mas|ter, who keeps them and works them for his own plea|sure or profit. If men were so void of reason, and bru|tish, as to enter into society upon such terms, <HI>prerogative</HI> might indeed be, what some men would have it, an arbi|trary power to do things hurtful to the people.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="012834_0087_0F8B3FBF5F633B88">But since a rational creature cannot be supposed, when free, to put himself into subjection to another, for his own harm; (though, where he finds a good and wise ruler, he may not perhaps think it either necessary or useful to set precise bounds to his power in all things) <HI>prerogative</HI> can be nothing but the people's permitting their rulers to do several things, of their own free choice, where the law was silent, and sometimes too against the direct let|ter of the law, for the public good; and their acquies|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in it when so done: for as a good prince, who is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the good of his people, cannot have too much <HI>preroga|tive,</HI> that is, power to do good; so a weak and ill prince, who would claim that power which his predecessors ex|ercised without the direction of the law, as a preroga|tive belonging to him by right of his office, which he may exercise at his pleasure, to make or promote an in|terest distinct from that of the public, gives the people an occasion to claim their right, and limit that power, which, whilst it was exercised for their good, they were content should be tacitly allowed.</P>
<P>And therefore he that will look into the <HI>history of Eng|land,</HI> will find, that <HI>prerogative</HI> was always <HI>largest</HI> in the hands of our wisest and best princes; because the peo|ple, observing the whole tendency of their actions to be the public good, contested not what was done without law to that end: or, if any human frail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y or mistake (for princes are but men, made as others) appeared in some small declinations from that end; yet 't was visible, the main of their conduct tended to nothing but the care of the public. The people therefore, finding rea|son to be satisfied with these princes, whenever they act|ed without, or contrary to the letter of the law, acqui|esced in what they did, and, without the least complaint, let them inlarge their <HI>prerogative</HI> as they pleased, judg|ing rightly, that they did nothing herein to the preju|dice of their laws, since they acted conformable to the foundation and end of all laws, the public good.</P>
<P>Such god-like princes indeed had some title to arbitra|ry power by that argument, that would prove absolute monarchy the best government, as that which God him|self governs the universe by; because such kings partake of his wisdom and goodness. Upon this is founded that saying. That the reigns of good princes have been alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys
<PB N="89" REF="012834_0088_0F8B3FC282BB14D8">
most dangerous to the liberties of their people: for when their successors, managing the government with different thoughts, would draw the actions of those good rulers into precedent, and make them the standard of their <HI>pre|rogative,</HI> as if what had been done only for the good of the people was a right in them to do, for the harm of the people, if they so pleased; it has often occasioned contest, and sometimes public disorders, before the peo|ple could recover their original right, and get that to be declared not to be <HI>prerogative,</HI> which truly was never so; since it is impossible that any body in the society should ever have a right to do the people harm; though it be very possible, and reasonable, that the people should not go about to set any bounds to the <HI>prerogative</HI> of those kings, or rulers, who themselves transgressed not the bounds of the public good: for <HI>prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule.</HI></P>
<P>The power of <HI>calling parliaments</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> as to precise time, place, and duration, is certainly a <HI>preroga|tive</HI> of the king, but still with this trust, that it shall be made use of for the good of the nation, as the exigencies of the times, and variety of occasions, shall require: for it being impossible to foresee which should always be the fittest place for them to assemble in, and what the best sea|son; the choice of these was left with the executive pow|er, as might be most subservient to the public good, and best suit the ends of parliaments.</P>
<P>The old question will be asked in this matter of <HI>prero|gative,</HI> But <HI>who shall be judge</HI> when this power is made a right use of? I answer: between an executive power in being, with such a prerogative, and a legislative that de|pends upon his will for their convening, there can be no <HI>judge on earth</HI>; as there can be none between the legisla|tive and the people, should either the executive, or the legislative, when they have got the power in their hands, design, or go about to enslave or destroy them. The peo|ple have no other remedy in this, as in all other cases where they have no judge on earth, but to <HI>appeal to hea|ven</HI>: for the rulers, in such attempts, exercising a pow|er the people never put into their hands, (who can never be supposed to consent that any body should rule over them for their harm) do that which they have not a right to do. And where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they
<PB N="90" REF="012834_0089_0F8B3FC328BC8338">
have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment. And therefore, though the <HI>people cannot</HI> be <HI>judge,</HI> so as to have, by the constitu|tion of that society, any superior power, to determine and give effective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where there lies no appeal on earth, <HI>viz.</HI> to judge, whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven. And this judgment they cannot part with, it being out of a man's power so to submit himself to another, as to give him a liberty to destroy him; God and nature never allowing a man so to abandon himself, as to neglect his own preservation: and since he cannot take away his own life, neither can he give another power to take it. Nor let any one think, this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder; for this o|perates not, till the inconveniency is so great, that the majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it amended. But this the executive power or wise princes, never need come in the danger of: and it is the thing&punc; of all others, they have most need to avoid, as of all others the most perilous.</P>

<HEAD>Of Paternal, Political, and Despotical Pow|er, considered together.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I have had occasion to speak to these se|parately before, yet the great mistakes of late about government, having, as I suppose arisen from confound|ing these distinct powers one with another, it may not, perhaps, be amiss to consider them here together.</P>
<P>First, then, <HI>paternal</HI> or <HI>parental power</HI> is nothing but that which parents have over their children, to govern them for the children's good, till they come to the use of reason, or a state of knowledge, wherein they may be supposed capable to understand that rule, whether it be the law of nature, or the municipal law of their country, they are to govern themselves by: capable, I say, to know it, as well as several others, who live as freemen under that law. The affection and tenderness which God hath planted in the breast of parents towards their
<PB N="91" REF="012834_0090_0F8B3FC3E2AC86A0">
children, makes it evident, that this is not intended to be a severe arbitrary government, but only for the help in|struction and preservation of their offspring&punc; but happen it as it will, there is, as I have proved, no reas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n why it should be thought to extend to life and death at any time, over their children, more than over any body else; nei|ther can there be any pretence why this <HI>parental power</HI> should keep the child, when grown to a man, in subjec|tion to the will of his parents, any farther than having received life and education from his parents, obliges him to respect, honour, gratitude, assistance and support all his life, to both father and mother. And thus, tis true, the <HI>paternal</HI> is a natural <HI>government,</HI> but not at all ex|tending itself to the ends and jurisdictions of that which is political. The <HI>power of the father doth not reach</HI> at all to the <HI>property</HI> of the child, which is only in his own dis|posing.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Political power</HI> is that power, which every man having in the state of nature, has given up into the hands of the society, and therein to the governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, whom the society hath set over itself, with this express or tacit trust, that it shall be employed for their good, and the preservation of their property: now this <HI>power,</HI> which every man has <HI>in the state of nature,</HI> and which he parts with to the society in all such cases where the society can secure him, is to use such means, for the preserving of his own property, as he thinks good, and nature allows him; and to punish the breach of the law of nature in others, so as (according to the best of his reason) may most conduce to the preservation of himself, and the rest of mankind. So that the <HI>end and measure of this power,</HI> when in every man's hands in the state of nature, being the preservation of all of his society, that is, all man|kind in general, it can have no other <HI>end or measure,</HI> when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and pos|sessions; and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as pos|sible to be preserved; but a <HI>power to make laws,</HI> and an|nex such <HI>penalties</HI> to them, as may tend to the preserva|tion of the whole, by cutting off those parts, and those only, which are so corrupt, that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this <HI>power has its original only from compact</HI> and agree|ment,
<PB N="92" REF="012834_0091_0F8B3FC4A13363C0">
and the mutual consent of those who make up the community.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Despotical power</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an absolute, arbitrary power one man has over another, to take away his life, whenever he pleases. This is a power, which neither nature gives, for it has made no such distinction between one man and another; nor compact can convey: for man not having such an arbitrary power over his own life, cannot give another man such a power over it; but it is the <HI>effect only of forfeiture,</HI> which the aggressor makes of his own life, when he puts himself into the state of war with another: for having quitted reason, which God hath given to be the rule betwixt man and man, and the common bond whereby human kind is uni|ted into one fellowship and society; and having renoun|ced the way of peace which that teaches, and made use of the force of war, to compass his unjust ends upon another, where he has no right; and so revolting from his own kind to that of beasts, by making force, which is their's, to be his rule of right&punc; he renders himself liable to be destroyed by the injured person, and the rest of mankind&punc; that will join with him in the execution of jus|tice, as any other wild beast, or noxious brute, with whom mankind can have neither society nor security<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Another copy corrected by Mr. Locke, has it thus, <HI>Nex|ious brute that is destructive to their being.</HI></NOTE>. And thus <HI>captives,</HI> taken in a just and lawful war and such only, are <HI>subject to a despotical power,</HI> which, as it arises not from compact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the state of war continued: for what compact can be made with a man that is not master of his own life? what condition can he perform? and if he be once al|lowed to be master of his own life, the <HI>despotical, arbi|trary power</HI> of his master ceases. He that is master of himself, and his own life, has a right too to the means of preserving it; so that <HI>as soon as compact enters, sla|very ceases,</HI> and he so far quits his absolute power, and puts an end to the state of war, who enters into condi|tions with his captive.</P>
<P><HI>Nature gives</HI> the first of these, <HI>viz. paternal power to parents</HI> for the benefit of their children during their minority, to supply their want of ability, and under|standing how to manage their property. (By <HI>property</HI> I must be understood here, as in other places, to mean
<PB N="93" REF="012834_0092_0F8B3FC55F671000">
that property which men have in their persons as well as goods.) <HI>Voluntary agreement gives</HI> the second, <HI>viz. political power to governors</HI> for the benefit of their sub|jects, to secure them in the possession and use of their properties. And <HI>forfeiture gives</HI> the third <HI>despotical power to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds</HI> for their own benefit, over those who are stripped of all property.</P>
<P>He, that shall consider the distinct rise and extent, and the different ends of these several powers, will plainly see, that <HI>paternal power</HI> comes as far short of that of the <HI>magistrate,</HI> as <HI>despotical</HI> exceeds it; and that <HI>absolute dominion,</HI> however placed, is so far from being one kind of civil society, that it is as inconsistent with it, as slavery is with property. <HI>Paternal power</HI> is only where mino|rity makes the child incapable to manage his property; <HI>political,</HI> where men have property in their own dispo|sal; and <HI>despotical,</HI> over such as have no property at all.</P>

<P>THOUGH governments can originally have no other rise than that before mentioned, nor <HI>politi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> be <HI>found|ed on</HI> any thing but <HI>the consent of the people</HI>; yet such have been the disorders ambition has filled the world with, that in the noise of war, which makes so great a part of the history of mankind, <HI>this consent</HI> is little taken notice of: and therefore many have mistaken the force of arms for the consent of the people, and reckon conquest as one of the originals of government. But <HI>conquest</HI> is as far from setting up any government, as demolishing an house is from building a new one in the place.

<P>That the <HI>aggressor,</HI> who puts himself into the state of war with another, and <HI>unjustly invades</HI> another man's right, <HI>can,</HI> by such an unjust war, <HI>never</HI> come to <HI>have a right over the conquered,</HI> will be easily agreed by all men, who will not think, that robbers and pirates have a right of empire over who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">soever they have force enough to master; or that men are bound by promises, which un|lawful force extorts from them. Should a robber break

into my house, and with a dagger at my throat make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him, would this give him any title? Just such a title, by his sword, has an <HI>un|just conqueror</HI> who forces me into submission. The in|jury and the crime is equal, whether committed by the wearer of a crown, or some petty villain. The title of the offender, and the number of his followers, make no difference in the offence, unless it be to aggravate it. The only difference is, great robbers punish little ones, to keep them in their obedience; but the great ones are rewarded with laurels and triumphs, because they are too big for the weak hands of justice in this world, and have the power in their own possession, which should punish offen|ders. What is my remedy against a robber, that so broke into my house? <HI>Appeal</HI> to the law for justice. But perhaps justice is denied, or I am crippled and cannot stir, robbed and have not the means to do it. If God has ta|ken away all means of seeking remedy, there is nothing left but patience. But my son, when able, may seek the relief of the law, which I am denied: he or his son may renew his <HI>appeal,</HI> till he recover his right. But the con|quered, or their children, have no court, no arbitrator on earth to appeal to. Then they may <HI>appeal,</HI> as <HI>Ieph|tha</HI> did <HI>to heaven,</HI> and repeat their <HI>appeal</HI> till they have recovered the native right of their ancestors, which was, to have such a legislative over them, as the majority should approve, and freely acquiesce in. If it be objected. This would cause endless trouble; I answer, no more than justice does, where she lies open to all that appeal to her. He that troubles his neighbour without a cause, is pun|ished for it by the justice of the court he appeals to: and he that <HI>appeals to heaven</HI> must be sure he has right on his side; and a right too that is worth the trouble and cost of the appeal, as he will answer at a tribunal that cannot be deceived, and will be sure to retribute to every one according to the mischiefs he hath created to his fellow subjects; that is, any part of mankind: from whence it is plain, that he that <HI>conquers in an unjust war can thereby have no title to the subjection and obedience of the conquered.</HI></P>
<P>But supposing victory favours the right side, let us con|sider a <HI>conqueror in a lawful war,</HI> and see what power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gets, and over whom.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="012834_0094_0F8B3FC91F096770"><HI>First,</HI> It is plain he <HI>gets no power by his conquest over those that conquered with him.</HI> They that fought on his side cannot suffer by the conquest, but must at least be as much freemen as they were before. And most commonly they serve upon terms, and on condition to share with their leader, &amp; enjoy a part of the spoil, &amp; other advanta|ges that attend the conquering sword; or at least have a part of the subdued country bestowed upon them. And <HI>the conquering people are not, I hope, to be slaves by con|quest,</HI> and wear their laurels only, to shew they are sacri|fices to their leaders triumph. They that found absolute monarchy upon the title of the sword, make their heroes, who are the founders of such monarchies, arrant <HI>Draw|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an sirs,</HI> and forget they had any officers and soldiers that fought on their side in the battles they won, or assisted them in the subduing, or shared in possessing, the countries they mastered. We are told by some, that the <HI>English</HI> monarchy is founded in the <HI>Norman</HI> conquest, and that our princes have thereby a title to absolute dominion: which if it were true, (as by the history it appears other|wise) and that <HI>William</HI> had a right to make war on this island; yet his dominion by conquest could reach no far|ther than to the <HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Britons,</HI> that were then in|habitants of this country. The <HI>Normans</HI> that came with him, and helped to conquer, and all descended from them, are freemen, and no subjects by conquest; let that give what dominion it will. And if I, or any body else, shall claim freedom, as derived from them, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: and it is plain, the law that has made no distinction between the one and the other, in|tends not there should be any difference in their freedom or privileges.</P>
<P>But supposing, which seldom happens, that the con|querors and conquered never incorporate into one peo|ple, under the same laws and freedom; let us see next <HI>what power a lawful conqueror has over the subdued</HI>: and that I say is purely despotical. He has an absolute power over the lives of those who by an unjust war have forfeited them; but not over the lives or fortunes of those who engaged not in the war, nor over the possessi|ons even of those who were actually engaged in it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I say then the <HI>conqueror</HI> gets no power but only over those who have actually assisted, concurred, or consented to that unjust force that is used against him:
<PB N="96" REF="012834_0095_0F8B3FC944E795B0">
for the people having given to their governors no power to do an unjust thing, such as is to make an unjust war, (for they never had such a power in themselves) they ought not to be charged as guilty of the violence and unjustice that is committed in an unjust war, any far|ther than they actually abet it; no more than they are to be thought guilty of any violence or oppression their governors should use upon the people themselves, or any part of their fellow subjects, they having impowered them no more to the one than to the other. Conque|rors, it is true, seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction, but they willingly permit the confusion of war to sweep all together: but yet this alters not the right; for the conquerors power over the lives of the conquered, being only because they have used force to do, or maintain an injustice, he can have that power only over those who have concurred in that force; all the rest are innocent; and he has no more title over the people of that country, who have done him no injury, and so have made no forfeiture of their lives, than he has over any other, who, without any injuries or provo|cations, have lived upon fair terms with him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>power a conqueror gets</HI> over those he overcomes <HI>in a just war, is perfectly despotical</HI>: he has an absolute power over the lives of those, who, by put|ting themselves in a state of war, have forfeited them; but he has not thereby a right and title to their possessi|ons. This I doubt not, but at first sight will seem a strange doctrine, it being so quite contrary to the prac|tice of the world; there being nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of countries, than to say such an one conquered it&punc; as if conquest, without any more ado&punc; conveyed a right of possession. But when we con|sider, that the practice of the strong and powerful&punc; how universal soever it may be, is seldom the rule of right, however it be one part of the subjection of the conque|red, not to argue against the conditions cut out to them by the conquering sword.</P>
<P>Though in all war there be usually a complication of force and damage, and the aggressor seldom fails to harm the estate, when he uses force against the persons of those he makes war upon; yet it is the use of force only that puts a man into the state of war: for whether by force he begins the injury, or else having quietly, and by fraud,
<PB N="97" REF="012834_0096_0F8B3FC9ECF110E0">
done the injury, he refuses to make reparation, and by force maintains it, (which is the same thing, as at first to have done it by force) it is the unjust use of force that makes the war: for he that breaks open my house, and violently turns me out of doors; or having peaceably got in, by force keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; supposing we are in such a state, that we have no com|mon judge on earth, whom I may appeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: for of such I am now speaking. It is the <HI>unjust use of force</HI> then, that <HI>puts a man into the state of war</HI> with another; and thereby he that is guilty of it makes a forfeiture of his li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e: for quit|ting reason, which is the rule given between man and man, and using force, the way of beasts, he becomes lia|ble to be destroyed by him he uses force against, as any savage ravenous beast, that is dangerous to his being.</P>
<P>But because the miscarriages of the father are no faults of the children, and they may be rational and peaceable, notwithstanding the brutishness &amp; injustice of the father; the father, by his miscarriages and violence, can forfeit but his own life, but involves not his children in his guilt or destruction. His goods, which nature, that willeth the preservation of all mankind as much as is possible, hath made to belong to the children to keep them from pe|rishing, do still continue to belong to his children: for supposing them not to have joined in the war, either thro' infancy&punc; absence, or choice, they have done nothing to forfeit them: <HI>nor has the conqueror any right</HI> to take them away, by the bare title of having subdued him that by force attempted his destruction; though perhaps he may have some right to them, to repair the damages he has sustained by the war, and the defence of his own right; which how far it reaches to the possessions of the con|quered&punc; we shall see by and by. So that he that <HI>by con|quest has a right over a man's person</HI> to destroy him if he pleases, has <HI>not</HI> thereby a right over <HI>his estate</HI> to possess and enjoy it: for it is the brutal force the aggressor has used, that gives his adversary a right to take away his life, and destroy him if he pleases, as a noxious creature; but it is damage sustained that alone gives him title to another man's goods: for though I may kill a thief that sets on me in the high-way, yet I may not (which seems less) take away his money, and let him go: this would be robbery on my side. His force, and the state of war
<PB N="98" REF="012834_0097_0F8B3FCAA0727520">
he put himself in, made him forfeit his life, but gave me no title to his goods. The <HI>right</HI> then of <HI>conquest ex|tends only to the lives</HI> of those who joined in the war, <HI>not to their estates,</HI> but only in order to make reparation for the damages received, and the charges of the war, and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent wife and children.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>conqueror</HI> have as much justice on his side, as could be supposed, he <HI>has</HI> no <HI>right</HI> to seize more than the vanquished could forfeit&punc; his life is at the victor's mer|cy; and his service and goods he may appropriate, to make himself reparation; but he cannot take the goods of his wife and children; they too had a title to the goods he enjoyed, and their shares in the estate he pos|sessed: for example, I in the state of nature (and all com|mon-wealths are in the state of nature one with another) have injured another man, and refusing to give satisfac|tion, it comes to a state of war, wherein my defending by force what I had gotten unjustly, makes me the aggres|sor. I am conquered: my life, it is true, as forfeit, is at mercy, but not my wife's and children's. They made not the war, nor assisted in it. I could not forfeit their lives; they were not mine to forfeit. My wife had a share in my estate; that neither could I forfeit. And my chidren also, being born of me, had a right to be maintained out of my labour or substance. Here then is the case: the conqueror has a title to reparation for damages received, and the children have a title to their father's estate for their subsistence: for as to the wife's share&punc; whether her own labour, or compact, gave her a title to it, it is plain&punc; her husband could not forfeit what was her's. What must be done in the case? I answer; the fundamental law of nature being, that all, as much as may be, should be preserved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully to <HI>satisfy</HI> both, <HI>viz.</HI> for the <HI>conque|ror's losses,</HI> and children's maintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his full satisfac|tion, and give way to the pressing and preferable title of those who are in danger to perish without it.</P>
<P>But supposing the <HI>charge</HI> and <HI>damages of the war</HI> are to be made up to the conqueror, to the utmost farthing; and that the children of the vanquished, spoiled of all their father's goods, are to be left to starve and perish; yet the satisfying of what shall, on this score, be due to
<PB N="99" REF="012834_0098_0F8B3FCBF6B470B8">
the conqueror, will scarce give him a <HI>title to any country be shall conquer:</HI> for the damages of war can scarce amount to the value of any considerable tract of land, in any part of the world, where all the land is possessed&punc; and none lies waste. And if I have not taken away the conqueror's land, which, being vanquished, it is im|possible I should; scarce any other spoil I have done him can amount to the value of mine, supposing it equally cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivated, and of an extent any way coming near what I had over-run of his. The destruction of a year's pro|duct or two (for it seldom reaches four or five) is the utmost spoil that usually can be done: for as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o money, and such riches and treasure taken away, these are none of nature's goods, they have but a fantastical imaginary value: nature has put no such upon them: they are of no more account by her standard, than the wampompeke of the <HI>Americans</HI> to an <HI>European</HI> prince, or the silver money of <HI>Europe</HI> would have been formerly to an <HI>Ame|rican.</HI> And five years product is not worth the perpe|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> inheritance of land&punc; where all is possessed, and none remains waste, to be taken up by him that is disseized: which will be easily granted, if one do but take away the imaginary value of money, the disproportion being more than between five and five hundred; though, at the same time, half a year's product is more worth than the inheritance&punc; where there being more land than the inhabitants possess and make use of, any one has liberty to make use of the waste: but there conquerors take little care to possess themselves of the <HI>lands of the van|quished.</HI> No damage therefore&punc; that men in the state of nature (as all princes and governments are in reference to one another) suffer from one another, can give a con|queror power to dispossess the posterity of the vanquish|ed, and turn them out of that inheritance, which ought to be the possession of them and their descendants to all generations. The conqueror indeed will be apt to think himself master: and it is the very condition of the sub|dued not to be able to dispu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e their right. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that be all, it gives no other title than what bare force gives to the stronger over the weaker: and by this reason, he that is strongest will have a right to whatever he pleases to seize on.</P>
<P>Over those then that joined with him in the war, and over those of the subdued country that opposed him not,
<PB N="100" REF="012834_0099_0F8B3FCC6DE25680">
and the posterity even of those that did, the conqueror, even in a just war, hath by his conquest, no <HI>right of do|minion</HI>: they are free from any subjection to him, and if their former government be dissolved, they are at li|berty to begin and erect another to themselves.</P>
<P>The conqueror, it is true&punc; usually, by the force he has over them&punc; compels them, with a sword at their breasts, to stoop to his conditions, and submit to such a govern|ment as he pleases to afford them; but the enquiry is, what right he has to do so? If it be said, they submit by their own consent, then this allows their own <HI>consent</HI> to be <HI>necessary to give the conqueror a title to rule</HI> over them. It remains only to be considered, whether <HI>promises ex|torted by force,</HI> without right, can be thought consent&punc; and <HI>how far they bind.</HI> To which I shall say, they <HI>bind not at all</HI>; because whatsoever another gets from me by force, I still retain the right of, and he is obliged pre|sently to restore. He that forces my horse from me, ought presently to restore him, and I have still a right to retake him. By the same reason, he that <HI>forced a pro|mise</HI> from me, ought presently to restore it, <HI>i. e.</HI> quit me of the obligation of it; or I may resume it myself, <HI>i. e.</HI> chuse whether I will perform it: for the law of nature laying an obligation on me only by the rule she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her rules: such is the extorting any thing from me by force. Nor does it at all alter the case to say, <HI>I gave my pro|mise,</HI> no more than it excuses the force&punc; and passes the right, when I put my hand in my pocket, and deliver my purse myself to a thief, who demands it with a pistol at my breast.</P>
<P>From all which it follows, that the <HI>government of a conqueror,</HI> imposed by force on the subdued, against whom he had no right of war, or who joined not in the war against him, where he had right, <HI>has no obligation</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>But let us suppose, that all the men of that commu|nity, being all members of the same body politic, may be taken to have joined in that unjust war wherein they are subdued, and so their lives are at the mercy of the conqueror.</P>
<P>I say&punc; this concerns not their children who are in their minority: for since a father hath not, in himself, a power over the life or liberty of his child, no act of his
<PB N="101" REF="012834_0100_0F8B3FCE707B29D0">
can possibly forfeit it. So that the children, whatever may have happened to the fathers, are freemen, and the absolute power of the <HI>conqueror</HI> reaches no farther than the persons of the men that were subdued by him, and dies with them: and should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e govern them as slaves, subjected to his absolute arbitary power, he <HI>has</HI> no <HI>such right of dominion over their children.</HI> He can have no power over them but by their own consent, whatever he may drive them to say or do; and he has no lawful au|thority&punc; whilst force, and not choice, compels them to submission.</P>
<P>Every man is born with a double right: <HI>first,</HI> a <HI>right of freedom to his person,</HI> which no other man has a power over, but the free disposal of it lies in himself. <HI>Secondly,</HI> a <HI>right,</HI> before any other man, <HI>to inherit</HI> with his bre|thren his <HI>father's goods.</HI></P>
<P>By the first of these, a man is <HI>naturally free</HI> from sub|jection to any government, tho' he be born in a place un|der its jurisdiction; but if he disclaim the lawful govern|ment of the country he was born in, he must also quit the right that belonged to him by the laws of it, and the possessions there descending to him from his ancestors, if it were a government made by their consent.</P>
<P>By the second, the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of any country, who are descended, and derive a title to their estates from those who are subdued, and had a government forced upon them against their free consents, <HI>retain a right to the pos|session of their ancestors,</HI> though they consent not freely to the government, whose hard conditions were by force imposed on the possessors of that country: for the first <HI>conqueror never having had a title to the land</HI> of that country, the people who are the descendents of, or claim under those who were forced to submit to the yoke of a government by constraint, have always a right to shake it off, and free themselves from the usurpation of tyran|ny which the sword hath brought in upon them, till their rulers put them under such a frame of government as they willingly and of choice consent to. Who doubts but the Grecian christians, descendants of the ancient pos|sessors of that country, may justly cast off the Turkish yoke, which they have so long groaned under, whenever they have an opportunity to do it? For no government can have a right to obedience from a people who have not freely consented to it; which they can never be sup|posed
<PB N="102" REF="012834_0101_0F8B3FCF1F575890">
to do, till either they are put in a full state of li|berty to chuse their government and governors, or at least till they have such standing laws, to which they have by themselves or their representatives given their free consent, and also till they are allowed their due property, which is so to be proprietors of what they have, that no body can take away any part of it without their own con|sent, without which, men under any government are not in the state of freemen, but are direct slaves under the force of war.</P>
<P>But granting that the <HI>conqueror</HI> in a just war has a right to the estates, as well as power over the persons, of the conquered; which, it is plain, he <HI>hath</HI> not: nothing of <HI>absolute power</HI> will follow from hence, in the continu|ance of the government; because the descendants of these being all freemen, if he grants them estates and posses|sions to inhabit his country, (without which it would be worth nothing) whatsoever he grants them, they have, so far as it is granted, <HI>property</HI> in. The nature whereof is, that <HI>without a man's own consent</HI> it <HI>cannot be taken from him.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>persons</HI> are <HI>free</HI> by a native right, and their <HI>pro|perties,</HI> be they more or less, are <HI>their own, and at their own dispose,</HI> and not at his; or else it is no <HI>property.</HI> Supposing the conqueror gives to one man a thousand acres, to him and his heirs forever; to another he lets a thousand acres for his life, under the rent of 50l. or 500l. <HI>per. ann.</HI> has not the one of these a right to his thousand acres forever, and the other, during his life, paying the said rent? and hath not the tenant for life a <HI>property</HI> in all that he gets over and above his rent, by his labour and industry during the said term, supposing it be double the rent? Can any one say, the king, or con|queror, after his grant, may by his power of conqueror take away all, or part of the land from the heirs of one, or from the other during his life, he paying the rent? or can he take away from either the goods or money they have got upon the said land, at his pleasure? If he can, then all free and voluntary <HI>contracts</HI> cease, and are void in the world; there needs nothing to dissolve them at any time, but power enough: and all the <HI>grants</HI> and <HI>pro|mises</HI> of <HI>men in power</HI> are but mockery and collusion: for can there be any thing more ridiculous than to say, I give you and your's this for ever, and that in the surest

and most solemn way of conveyance can be devised; and yet it is to be understood&punc; that I have right&punc; if I please, to take it away from you again to morrow?</P>
<P>I will not dispute now whether princes are exempt from the laws of their country&punc; but this I am sure, they owe subjection to the laws of God and nature. No bo|dy, no power, can exempt them from the obligations of that eternal law. Those are so great, and so strong, in the case of <HI>promises,</HI> that omnipotency itself can be tied by them <HI>Grants, promises,</HI> and <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ths</HI>&punc; are <HI>bonds</HI> that <HI>hold the Almighty</HI>: whatever some flatterers say to prin|ces of the world, who all together with all their people joined to them are, in comparison of the great God, but as a drop of the bucket, or a dust on the balance, incon|siderable, nothing!</P>
<P>The short of the <HI>case in conquest</HI> is this: the conqueror, if he have a just cause, has a despotical right over the persons of all&punc; that actually aided, and concurred in the war against him, and a right to make up his damage and cost out of their labour and estates, so he injure not the right of any other. Over the rest of the people, if there were any that consented not to the war, and over the children of the captives themselves, or the possessions of either, he has no power; and so can have, <HI>by virtue of conquest, no lawful title</HI> himself <HI>to dominion</HI> over them, or derive it to his posterity; but is an aggressor, if he attempts, upon their properties, and thereby puts himself in a state of war against them, and has no better a right of principality&punc; he&punc; nor any of his successors, than <HI>Hingar,</HI> or <HI>Hubba,</HI> the Danes, had here in <HI>England</HI>; or <HI>Spartacus,</HI> had he conquered <HI>Italy,</HI> would have had; which is to have their yoke cast off&punc; as soon as God shall give those under their subjecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n courage and opportunity to do it.

<HEAD>Of USURPATION.</HEAD>
<P>AS conquest may be called a foreign usurpation, so usurpation is a kind of domestic conquest, with this difference, that an usurper can never have right on his side, it being no <HI>usurpation,</HI> but where one is got into the <HI>possession of what another has right to.</HI> This, so far as it is <HI>usurpation,</HI> is a change only of persons, but not of the forms and rules of the government: for if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belonged to the lawful princes, or governors of the common wealth, it is <HI>tyranny</HI> added to <HI>usurpation.</HI></P>
<P>In all lawful governments, the designation of the per|sons, who are to bear rule, is as natural and necessary a part as the form of the government itself, and is that which had its establishment originally from the people; the anarchy being much alike, to have no form of go|vernment at all; or to agree, that it shall be monarchi|cal, but to appoint no way to design the person that shall have the power, and be the monarch. Hence all com|monwealths, with the form of government established, have rules also of appointing those who are to have any share in the public authority, and settled methods of conveying the right to them: for the anarchy is much alike, to have no form of government at all: or to agree that it shall be monarchical, but to appoint no way to know or design the person that shall have the power, and be the monarch. Whoever gets into the exercise of any part of the power, by other ways than what the laws of the community have prescribed, hath no right to be obeyed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hough the form of the commonwealth be still preserved; since he has not the person the laws have ap|pointed, and consequently not the person the people have consented to.

<HEAD>Of TYRANNY.</HEAD>
<P>AS usurpation is the exercise of power, which ano|ther hath a right to; so <HI>tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right,</HI> which no body can have a right to. And this is making use of the power any one has in his hands, not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private separate advantage. When the go|vernor, however intitled, makes not the law, but his will, the rule; and his commands and actions are not direc|ted to the preservation of the properties of his people, but the satisfaction of his own ambition, revenge, cove|tousness, or any other irregular passion.</P>
<P>If one can doubt this to be truth, or reason, because it comes from the obscure hand of a subject, I hope the authority of a king will make it pass with him. King <HI>Iames</HI> the first, in his speech to the parliament, 1603, tells them thus, <HI>I will ever prefer the weal of the public, and of the whole commonwealth, in making of good laws and constitutions to any particular and private ends of mine; thinking ever the wealth and weal of the commonwealth to be my greatest weal and worldly felicity&punc; a point where|in a lawful king doth directly differ from a tyrant: for I do acknowledge, that the special and greatest point of dif|ference that is between a rightful king and an usurping tyrant, is this; that whereas the proud and ambitious ty|rant doth think his kingdom and people are only ordained for satisfaction of his desires and unreasonable appetites, the righteous and just king doth by the contrary acknowledge himself to be ordained for the procuring of the wealth and property of his people.</HI> And again, in his speech to the parliament, 1609, he hath these words, <HI>The king binds himself by a double oath, to the observation of the funda|mental laws of his kingdom; tacitly, as by being a king, and so bound to protect as well the people, as the laws of his kingdom; and expresly, by his oath at his coronation: so as every just king, in a settled kingdom, is bound to ob|serve that paction made to his people, by his laws, in fra|ming his government agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with</HI> Noah <HI>after the deluge. Hereafter, feed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and
<PB N="106" REF="012834_0105_0F8B3FD22EAB6340">
summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease while the earth remaineth. And therefore a king govern|ing in a settled kingdom, leaves to be a king, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gene|rates into a tyrant, as soon as he leaves off to rule accord|ing to his laws.</HI> And a little after, <HI>Therefore all kings that are not tyrants, or perjured, will be glad to bound themse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves within the limits of their laws; and they that persuade them the contrary, are vipers, and pests both against them and the commonwealth.</HI> Thus that learned king, who well understood the notion of things, makes the difference betwixt a <HI>king</HI> and a <HI>tyrant</HI> to consist only in this, that one makes the laws the bounds of his pow|er, and the good of the public, the end of his govern|ment; the other makes all give way to his own will and appetite.</P>
<P>It is a mistake, to think this fault is proper only to monarchies; other forms of government are liable to it, as well as that: for wherever the power, that is put in any hands for the government of the people, and the pre|servation of their properties, is applied to other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harrass, or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it; there it presently becomes <HI>tyranny,</HI> whether those that thus use it are one or many. Thus we read of the thirty tyrants at <HI>Athens,</HI> as well as one at <HI>Syracuse</HI>; and the intolerable dominion of the <HI>Decemviri</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> was no|thing better.</P>
<P><HI>Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins,</HI> if the law be transgressed to another's harm; and whosoever in au|thority exceeds the power given him by the law, and makes use of the force he has under his command, to compass that upon the subject, which the law allows not, ceases in that to be a magistrate; and, acting without authority may be opposed as any other man&punc; who by force invades the right of another. This is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. He that hath authority to seize my person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a robber&punc; if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ, notwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant&punc; and such a legal authority, as will im|power him to arrest me abroad And why this should not hold in the highest, as well as in the most in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erior magistrate, I would gladly be informed. Is it reasona|ble, that the eldest brother, because he has the greatest

part of his father's estate, should thereby have a right to take away any of his younger brothers portions? or that a rich man, who possessed a whole country, should from thence have a right to seize, when he pleased, the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour? The being rightfully possessed of great power and riches, exceed|ingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of <HI>Adams,</HI> is so far from being an excuse, much less a reason, for rapine and oppression, which the endamaging another without authority is, that it is a great aggravation of it&punc; for the exceeding the bounds of authority is no more a right in a great, than in a petty officer; no more justifi|able in a king than a constable; but is so much the worse in him, in that he has more trust put in him, has already a much greater share than the rest of his bre|thren, and is supposed, from the advantages of his edu|cation, employment, and councell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore know|ing in the measures of right and wrong.</P>

This will unhinge and overturn all polities, and, instead of government and order, leave nothing but anarchy and confusion.</P>
<P>To this I answer, that <HI>force</HI> is to be <HI>opposed</HI> to nothing, but to unjust and unlawful <HI>force</HI>; whoever makes any opposition in any other case, draws on himself a just con|demnation both from God and man; and so no such dan|ger or confusion will follow, as is often suggested: for,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As, in some countries, the person of the prince by the law is sacred; and so, whatever he commands or does, his person is still free from all question or violence, not liable to force or any judicial censure or condemna|tion. But yet opposition may be made to the illegal acts of any inferior officer, or other commissioned by him; unless he will by actually putting himself into a state of war with his people, dissolve the government, and leave them to that defence which belongs to every one in the state of nature: for of such things who can tell what the end will be? and a neighbour kingdom has shewed the world an odd example. In all other cases the <HI>sacredness</HI> of the <HI>person exempts him from all inconveniencies,</HI> whereby he is secure, whilst the government stands, from all vio|lence and harm whatsoever: than which there cannot
<PB N="108" REF="012834_0107_0F8B3FD3B4B57050">
be a wiser constitution: for the harm he can do in his own person not being likely to happen often, nor to ex|tend itself far; nor being able by his single strength to subvert the laws, nor oppress the body of the people, should any prince have so much weakness, and ill nature as to be willing to do it, the inconveniency of some particular mischiefs, that may happen sometimes, when a heady prince comes to the throne, are well recompensed by the peace of the public, and security of the government, in the person of the chief magistrate, thus set out of the reach of danger: it being safer for the body, that some few private men should be sometimes in danger to suffer, than that the head of the republic should be easily, and upon flight occasions, exposed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> But this privilege, belonging only to the king's person, hinders not but they may be questioned, opposed, and resisted, who use unjust force, though they pretend a commission from him, which the law authori|zes not; as is plain in the case of him that has the king's writ to arrest a man, which is a full commission from the king; and yet he that has it cannot break open a man's house to do it, nor execute this command of the king upon certain days, nor in certain places, though this commis|sion have no such exception in it; but they are the limi|tations of the law which if any one transgress, the king's commission excuses him not: for the king's authority being given him only by the law, he cannot impower any one to act against the law, or justify him, by his com|mission, in so doing; the <HI>commission,</HI> or <HI>command of any magistrate, where he has no authority,</HI> being as <HI>void</HI> and insignificant, as that of any private man; the difference between the one and the other, being that the magistrate has some authority so far, and to such ends, and the pri|vate man has none at all: for it is not the <HI>commission,</HI> but the <HI>authority,</HI> that gives the right of acting; and <HI>against the laws there can be no authority.</HI> But, notwithstanding such resistance, the king's person and authority are still both secured, and so <HI>no danger to governor or government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Supposing a government wherein the person of the chief magistrate is not thus sacred; yet this <HI>doc|trine</HI> of the lawfulness of <HI>resisting</HI> all unlawful exercises of his power, <HI>will not</HI> upon every slight occasion endan|ger him, or <HI>imbroil the government:</HI> for where the injur|ed party may be relieved, and his damages repaired by
<PB N="109" REF="012834_0108_0F8B3FD4683234F8">
appeal to the law, there can be no pretence for force, which is only to be used where a man is intercepted from appealing to the law: for nothing is to be accounted hostile force, but where it leaves not the remedy of such an appeal; and it is such <HI>force</HI> alone, that <HI>puts</HI> him that uses it <HI>into a state of war,</HI> and makes it lawful to resist him. A man with a sword in his hand demands my purse in the high-way, when perhaps I have not twelve pence in my pocket: this man I may lawfully kill. To ano|ther I deliver 100l. to hold only whilst I alight, which he refuses to restore me, when I am got up again, but draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his sword to defend the possession of it by force, if I endeavour to retake it. The mischief this man does me is a hundred or possibly a thousand times more than the other perhaps intended me (whom I killed before he really did me any); and yet I might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt the other lawfully. The reason whereof is plain; because the one using <HI>force,</HI> which threatned my life, I could not have <HI>time to appeal</HI> to the law to secure it: and when it was gone, it was too late to appeal. The law could not restore life to my dead carcass: the loss was irreparable; which to pre|vent, the law of nature gave me a right to <HI>destroy</HI> him, who had put himself in a state of war with me, and threatened my destruction. But in the other case, my life not being in danger, I may have the <HI>benefit of appeal|ing</HI> to the law, and have reparation for my 100l. that way.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> But if the unlawful acts done by the magis|trate be maintained (by the power he has got,) and the remedy which is due by law, be by the same power ob|structed; yet the <HI>right of resisting,</HI> even in such manifest acts of tyranny, <HI>will not</HI> suddenly or on slight occasions, <HI>disturb the government</HI>: for if it reach no farther than some private men's cases, though they have a right to de|fend themselves, and to recover by force what by unlaw|ful force is taken from them; yet the right to do so will not easily engage them in a contest, wherein they are sure to perish; it being as impossible for one, or a few op|pressed men to <HI>disturb the government,</HI> where the body of the people do not think themselves concerned in it, as for a raving mad-man, or heady mal-content to overturn a well-settled state; the people being as little apt to fol|low the one, as the other.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="012834_0109_0F8B3FD557A86D50">But if either these illegal acts have extended to the ma|jority of the people; or if the mischief and oppression has lighted only on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, and consequences seem to threaten all: and they are perswaded in their consciences, that their laws, and with them their estates, liberties, and lives are in danger, and perhaps their religion too; how they will be hindered from resisting illegal force, used against them, I cannot tell. This is an <HI>inconvenience,</HI> I confess, <HI>that attends all governments</HI> whatsoever, when the governors have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected of their people; the most dangerous state which they can possibly put themselves in; wherein they are the less to be pitied, because it is so easy to be avoided; it being as impossible for a governor, if he really means the good of his people, and the preservation of them, and their laws together, not to make them see and feel it, as it is for the father of a family, not to let his children see he loves, and takes care of them.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Dissolution of Government.</HEAD>
<P>HE that will with any clearness speak of the <HI>dissolu|tion of government,</HI> ought in the first place to di|stinguish between the <HI>dissolution of the society</HI> and the <HI>dissolution of the government.</HI> That which makes the community, and brings men out of the loose state of nature, into <HI>one politic society,</HI> is the agreement which every one has with the rest to incorporate, and act as one body, and so be one distinct common wealth. The usual, and almost only way whereby <HI>this union is dissolved,</HI> is the inroad of foreign force making a conquest upon them: for in that case, (not being able to maintain and support themselves, as <HI>one intire</HI> and <HI>independent body</HI>) the union belonging to that body which consisted therein, must necessarily cease, and so every one return to the state he was in before, with a liberty to shift for himself, and provide for his own safety, as he thinks fit&punc; in some other society. Whenever the <HI>society is dissolved,</HI> it is certain the government of that society cannot remain. Thus conquerors swords often cut up governments by the roots, and mangle societ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to pieces, separating the subdued or scattered multitude from the protection of, and de|pendence on, that society which ought to have preserved them from violence. The world is too well instructed in, and too forward to allow of, this way of dissolving of governments, to need any more to be said of it; and there wants not much argument to prove, that where the <HI>society is dissolved</HI>&punc; the government cannot remain; that being as impossible, as for the frame of an house to subsist when the materials of it are scattered and dissipa|ted by a whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused heap by an earthquake.</P>
<P>Besides this over-turning from without, <HI>governments are dissolved from within,</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> When the <HI>legislative</HI> is <HI>altered.</HI> Civil society being a state of peace, amongst those who are of it, from whom the state of war is excluded by the umpirage, which they have provided in their legislative, for the ending all differences that may arise amongst any of them&punc; it is in their <HI>legislative</HI> that the members of a com|mon-wealth are united&punc; and combined together into one coherent living body. This <HI>is the soul that gives form, life, and unity,</HI> to the common-wealth: from hence the
<PB N="112" REF="012834_0111_0F8B3FD7EC779738">
several members have their mutual influence, sympathy, and connexion: and therefore, when the <HI>legislative</HI> is broken, or <HI>dissolved,</HI> dissolution and death follows: for the <HI>essence and union of the society</HI> consisting in having one will, the legislative when once established by the ma|jority, has the declaring&punc; and as it were keeping of that will. The <HI>constitution of the legislative</HI> is the first and fundamental act of society, whereby provision is made for the <HI>continuation of their union,</HI> under the direction of persons, and bonds of laws&punc; made by persons authorized thereunto, by the consent and appointment of the people, without which no one man, or number of men, amongst them, can have authority of making laws that shall be binding to the rest. When any on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or more, shall take upon them to make laws, whom the people have not ap|pointed so to do, they make laws without authority, which the people are not therefore bound to obey; by which means they come again to be out of subjection, and may constitute to themselves a <HI>new legislative,</HI> as they think best, being in full liberty to resist the force of those, who without authority would impose any thing upon them. Every one is at the disposure of his own will, when those who had by the delegation of the socie|ty, the declaring of the public will, are excluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such authority or delegation.</P>
<P>This being usually brought about by such in the com|monwealth who misuse the power they have; it is hard to consider it aright, and know at whose door to lay it, without knowing the form of government in which it happens. Let us suppose then the legislative placed in the concurrence of three distinct persons.</P>
<P N="1">1. A single hereditary person, having the constant, supreme, executive power, and with it the power of con|voking and dissolving the other two within certain peri|ods of time.</P>
<P N="2">2. An assembly of hereditary nobility.</P>
<P N="3">3. An assembly of representatives chosen, <HI>pro tempore</HI>&punc; by the people. Such a form of government supposed, it is evident,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That when such a single person, or prince, sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws, which are the will of the society, declared by the legislative, then the <HI>legislative is changed</HI>: for that being in effect the legisla|tive,
<PB N="113" REF="012834_0112_0F8B3FD81F3BA6B8">
whose rules and laws are put in execution, and re|quired to be obeyed; when other laws are set up, and other rules pretended, and inforced, than what the le|gislative, constituted by the society, have enacted, it is plain that the <HI>legislative is changed.</HI> Whoever introduces new laws, not being thereunto authorized by the funda|mental appointment of the society, or subverts the old, disowns and overturns the power by which they were made, and so sets up a <HI>new legislative.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When the prince hinders the legislative from assembling in its due time, or from acting freely, pur|suant to those ends for which it was constituted&punc; the <HI>le|gislative is altered</HI>: for it is not a certain number of men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have also freedom of debating, and leisure of perfecting&punc; what is for the good of the society, wherein the legislative-consists; when these are taken away or altered, so as to deprive the so|ciety of the due exercise of their power, the <HI>legislative</HI> is truly altered; for it is not names that constitute go|vernments, but the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany them; so that he, who takes away the freedom, or hinders the acting of the legisla|tive in its due seasons, in effect takes <HI>away the legislative,</HI> and <HI>puts an end to the government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> When, by the arbitrary power of the prince, the electors, or ways of election, are altered, without the consent, and contrary to the common interest of the peo|ple, there also the <HI>legislative is altered</HI>: for, if others than those whom the society hath authorized thereunto, do chuse, or in another way than what the society hath prescribed, those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the people.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The delivery also of the people into the sub|jection of a foreign power, either by the prince, or by the legislative, is certainly a <HI>change of the legislative,</HI> and so a <HI>dissolution of the government:</HI> for the end why people entered into society being to be preserved one intire, free, independent society, to be governed by its own laws; this is lost, whenever they are given up into the power of another.</P>
<P>Why, in such a constitution as this, the <HI>dissolution of the government</HI> in these cases is to be imputed to the prince, is evident: because he, having the force, treasure and offices of the state to employ, and often persuading
<PB N="114" REF="012834_0113_0F8B3FD9F10A7180">
himself, or being flattered by others, that as supreme magistrate he is uncapable of controul; he alone is in a condition to make great advances toward such changes, under pretence of lawful authority, and has it in his hands to terrify or suppress opposers, as factious, sediti|ous and enemies to the government: whereas no other part of the legislative, or people, is capable by them|selves to attempt any alteration of the legislative, with|out open and visible rebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of, which, when it prevails, produces effects very little different from foreign conquest. Besides, the prince in such a form of government, having the power of dissolving the other parts of the legislative, and there|by rendering them private persons, they can never in op|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sition to him, or without his concurrence, alter the legislative by a law, his consent being necessary to give any of their decrees that sanction. But yet, so far as the other parts of the legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the government, and do either pro|mote, or not, what lies in them, hinder such designs, they are guilty, and partake in this, which is certainly the greatest crime men can be guilty of one towards ano|ther.</P>
<P>There is one way more whereby such a government may be dissolved, and that is, when he who has the su|preme executive power, neglects and abandons that charge, so that the laws already made can no longer be put in execution. This is demonstratively to reduce all to anarchy, and so effectually <HI>to dissolve the government</HI>: for laws not being made for themselves, but to be, by their execution, the bonds of the society, to keep every part of the body politic in its due place and function; when that totally ceases, the <HI>government</HI> visibly <HI>ceases,</HI> and the people become a confused multitude, without order or connexion. Where there is no longer the ad|ministration of justice, for the securing of men's rights, nor any remaining power within the community to di|rect the force, or provide for the necessities of the pub|lic&punc; there certainly is <HI>no government lest.</HI> Where the laws cannot be executed it is all one as if there were no laws; and a government without laws is, I suppose, a mystery in politics, unconceivable to human capacity, and inconsistent with human society.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="012834_0114_0F8B3FDA9B64B5E8">In these and the like cases, <HI>when the government is dis|solved,</HI> the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good: for the <HI>society</HI> can never, by the fault of another, lose the native and origi|nal right it has to preserve itself, which can only be done by a settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the laws made by it. But the state of mankind is not so miserable that they are not capable of using this re|medy, till it be too late to look for any. To tell <HI>people</HI> they <HI>may provide for themselves,</HI> by erecting a new legis|lative, when by oppression, artifice, or being delivered over to a foreign power, their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may expect relief when it is too late, and the evil is past cure. This is in effect no more than to bid them first be slaves, and then to take care of their liberty; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may act like freemen. This, if barely so, is rather mockery than relief; and men can never be se|cure from tyranny, if there be no means to escape it till they are perfectly under it: and therefore it is, that they have not only a right to get out of it, but to prevent it.</P>
<P>There is therefore, secondly, another way whereby <HI>governments are dissolved,</HI> and that is, when the legisla|tive, or the prince, either of them, act contrary to their trust.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>legislative acts against the trust</HI> reposed in them, when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject, and to make themselves, or any part of the community, masters, or arbitrary disposers of the lives, liberties, or fortunes of the people.</P>
<P>The reason why men enter into society, is the preser|vation of their property; and the end why they chuse and authorize a legislative, is, that there may be laws made and rules set, as guards and fences to the proper|ties of all the members of the society, to limit the power, and moderate the dominion, of every part and member of the society: for since it can never be suppo|sed to be the will of the society, that the legislative should have a power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into society, and for which the peo|ple submitted themselves to legislators of their own ma|king; whenever the <HI>legislators endeavour to take away,
<PB N="116" REF="012834_0115_0F8B3FDB2F6D5F68">
and destroy the property of the people,</HI> or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absol|ved from any farther obedience, and are left to the com|mon refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the <HI>legislative</HI> shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption&punc; <HI>endea|vour to grasp</HI> themselves, <HI>or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power</HI> over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they <HI>forfeit the power</HI> the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty, and, by the establishment of a new legislative, (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own safety and security, which is the end for which they are in society. What I have said here con|cerning the legislative in general, holds true, also con|cerning the supreme executor, who having a double trust put in him, both to have a part in the legislative, and the supreme execution of the law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own arbitrary will as the law of the society. He <HI>acts</HI> also <HI>contrary to his trust,</HI> when he either employs the force, treasure, and offices of the so|ciety, to corrupt the <HI>representatives,</HI> and gain them to his purposes; or openly pre-engages the <HI>electors,</HI> and pre|scribes to their choice, such, whom he has, by sollicita|tions, threats, promises, or otherwise, won to his designs; and employs them to bring in such, who have promised before hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-model the ways of election, what is it but to cut up the government by the roots, and poison the very fountain of public security? for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their <HI>representatives,</HI> as the fence to their properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might al|ways be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act, and ad|vise, as the necessity of the commonwealth, and the public good should, upon examination, and mature de|bate, be judged to require. This, those who give their votes before they hear the debate&punc; and have weighed the reasons on all sides, are not capable of doing. To pre|pare such an assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the declared abettors of his own will, for the true <HI>repre|sentatives</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="012834_0116_0F8B3FDBE5288AF0">
of the people, and the law-makers of the soci|ety, is certainly as great a <HI>breach of trust,</HI> and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end, and all the arts of perverted law made use of, to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country, it will be past doubt what is doing. What power they ought to have in the society&punc; who thus employ it contrary to the trust went along with it in its first institution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he, who has once attempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.</P>
<P>To this perhaps it will be said&punc; that the people being ignorant, and always discontented, to lay the foundation of government in the unsteady opinion and uncertain humour of the people, is to expose it to certain ruin&punc; and <HI>no government will be able long to subsist,</HI> if the peo|ple may set up a new legislative, whenever they take of|fence at the old one. To this I answer, Quite the con|trary. People are not so easily got out of their old forms, as some are apt to suggest. They are hardly to be pre|vailed with to amend the acknowledged faults in the frame they have been accustomed to. And if there be any original defects, or adventitious ones introduced by time or corruption; it is not an easy thing to get them changed, even when all the world sees there is an oppor|tunity for it. This slowness and aversion in the people to quit their old constitutions, has, in the many revolu|tions which have been seen in this kingdom, in this and former ages&punc; still kept us to, or, after some interval of fruitless attempts, still brought us back again to our old legislative of king, lords and commons: and whatever provocations have made the crown be taken from some of our princes heads, they never carried the people so far as to place it in another line.</P>
<P>But it will be said, this <HI>hypothesis</HI> lays a <HI>ferment for</HI> fre|quent <HI>rebellion.</HI> To which I answer&punc;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> No more than any other <HI>hypothesis</HI>: for when the people are made miserable, and find themselves <HI>ex|posed to the ill usage of arbitrary power,</HI> cry up their go|vernors, as much as you will, for sons of <HI>Iupiter</HI>; let them be sacred and divine, descended, or authorized from
<PB N="118" REF="012834_0117_0F8B3FDCEC56D480">
heaven; give them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. <HI>The people generally ill treated,</HI> and contrary to right&punc; will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them. They will wish and seek for the opportunity, which in the change, weakness and accidents of human affairs, seldom delays long to offer itself. He must have lived but a little while in the world, who has not seen exam|ples of this in his time; and he must have read very lit|tle, who cannot produce examples of it in all sorts of go|vernments in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I answer, such <HI>revolutions happen</HI> not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs. <HI>Great mis|takes</HI> in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, and all the <HI>slips</HI> of human frailty, will be <HI>born by the people</HI> without mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses&punc; prevarications and artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, and they cannot but feel what they lie under, and see whi|ther they are going; it is not to be wondered, that they should then rouze themselves&punc; and endeavour to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected; and without which, ancient names, and specious forms, are so far from being better, that they are much worse, than the state of nature, or pure anarchy; the inconveniencies being all as great and as near, but the remedy farther off and more difficult.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I answer, that <HI>this doctrine</HI> of a power in the people of providing for their safety a-new, by a new legislative, when their legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their property, is <HI>the best fence against rebellion,</HI> and the probablest means to hinder it: for <HI>rebellion</HI> being an opposition, not to per|sons, but authority, which is founded only in the con|stitutions and laws of the government; those, whoever they be, who by force break through&punc; and by force justify their violation of them, are truly and properly <HI>rebels</HI>: for when men, by entering into society and civil govern|ment, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of property, peace, and unity amongst them|selves, those who set up force again in opposition to the laws, do <HI>rebellare,</HI> that is, bring back again the state of war, and are properly rebels: which they who are in
<PB N="119" REF="012834_0118_0F8B3FDD62BF91A0">
power, (by the pretence they have to authority, the temptation of force they have in their hands, and the flattery of those about them) being likeliest to do; the properest way to prevent the evil, is to shew them the danger and injustice of it, who are under the greatest temptation to run into it.</P>
<P>In both the fore-mentioned cases, when either the le|gislative is changed, or the legislators act contrary to the end for which they were constituted; those who are guil|ty are <HI>guilty of rebellion</HI>: for if any one by force takes away the established legislative of any society, and the laws by them made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes away the umpirage, which every one had con|sented to, for a peaceable decision of all their controver|sies, and a bar to the state of war amongst them. They, who remove, or change the legislative, take away this decisive power, which no body can have, but by the ap|pointment and consent of the people; and so destroying the authority which the people did, and no body else can set up, and introducing a power which the people hath not authorized, they actually <HI>introduce a state of war,</HI> which is that of force without authority: and thus, by removing the legislative established by the so|ciety, (in whose decisions the people acquiesced and uni|ted, as to that of their own will) they untie the knot, and <HI>expose the people a-new to the state of war.</HI> And if those, who by force take away the legislative, are <HI>rebels,</HI> the <HI>legislators</HI> themselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when they, who were set up for the protection, and preservation of the people, their liberties and properties, shall by force invade and endeavour to take them away; and so they putting themselves into a state of war with those who made them the protectors and guardians of their peace, are properly, and with the greatest aggravation, <HI>rebellantes,</HI> rebels.</P>
<P>But if they, who say <HI>it lays a foundation for rebellion,</HI> mean that it may occasion civil wars, or intestine broils, to tell the people they are absolved from obedience when illegal attempts are made upon their liberties or proper|ties, and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who were their magistrates, when they invade their properties contrary to the trust put in them; and that therefore this doctrine is not to be allowed, being so destructive to the peace of the world: they may as well say, upon the
<PB N="120" REF="012834_0119_0F8B3FDEA18A49D8">
same ground, that honest men may not oppose robbers or pirates, because this may occasion disorder or blood|shed. If any <HI>mischief</HI> come in such cases, it is not to be charged upon him who defends his own right, but <HI>on him that invades</HI> his neighbours. If the innocent honest man must quietly quit all he has, for peace sake, to him who will lay violent hands upon it, I desire it may be considered&punc; what a kind of peace there will be in the world, which consists only in violence and rapine; and which is to be maintained only for the benefit of robbers and oppressors. Who would not think it an admirable peace betwixt the mighty and the mean, when the lamb, without resistance, yielded his throat to be torn by the imperious wolf? <HI>Polyphemus</HI>'s den gives us a perfect pat|tern of such a peace, and such a government, wherein <HI>Ulysses</HI> and his companions had nothing to do&punc; but qui|etly to suffer themselves to be devoured. And no doubt <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who was a prudent man, preached up <HI>passive obe|dience,</HI> and exhorted them to a quiet submission, by re|presenting to them of what concernment peace was to mankind; and by shewing the inconveniences might happen, if they should offer to resist <HI>Polyphemus,</HI> who had now the power over them.</P>
<P>The end of government is the good of mankind; and which is <HI>best for mankind,</HI> that the people should be al|ways exposed to the boundless will of tyranny, or that the rulers should be sometimes liable to be opposed, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their power, and em|ploy it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the properties of their people?</P>
<P>Nor let any one say, that mischief can arise from hence, as often as it shall please a busy head, or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the government. It is true, such men may stir whenever they please; but it will be only to their just ruin and perdition: for till the mis|chief be grown general, and the ill designs of the rulers become visible or their attempts se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sible to the greater part&punc; the people who are more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance, are not apt to stir. The examples of particular injustice, or oppression of here and there an unfortunate man, moves them not. But if they universally have a persuasion, grounded upon manifest evidence, that designs are carrying on against their liber|ties and the general course and tendency of things can|not

not but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors who is to be blamed for it? Who can help it, if they, who might avoid it, bring themselves into this suspicion?

This I am sure, whoe|ver, either ruler or subject, by force goes about to invade the rights of either prince or people, and lays the foun|dation for <HI>overturning</HI> the constitution, and frame of <HI>any just government,</HI> is highly guilty of the greatest crime, I think, a man is capable of, being to answer for all those mischiefs of blood, rapine and desolation, which the break|ing to pieces of governments bring on a country. And he who does it, is justly to be esteemed the common ene|my and pest of mankind, and is to be treated accordingly.</P>
<P>That <HI>subjects</HI> or <HI>foreigners,</HI> attempting by force on the properties of any people, may be <HI>resisted</HI> with force, is agreed on all hands. But that <HI>magistrates,</HI> doing the same thing may be <HI>resisted,</HI> hath of late been denied: as if those who had the greatest privileges and advantages by the law, had there by a power to break those laws, by which alone they were set in a better place than their brethren: whereas their offence is thereby the greater, both as being ungrateful for the greater share they have by the law, and breaking also that trust, which is put into their hands by their brethren.</P>

Where|fore if the king shall shew an hatred, not only to some par|ticular persons, but sets himself against the body of the commonwealth, whereof he is the head, and shall, with in|tolerable ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the whole, or a considerable part of the people, in this case the people have a right to resist and defend themselves from injury: but it must be with this caution, that they only defend themselves, but do not attack their prince: they may repair the dama|ges received, but must not for any provocation exceed the bounds of due reverence and respect. They may repulse the present attempt, but must not revenge past violences: for it is natural for us to defend life and limb, but that an inferior should punish a superior, is against nature.

people become free and superior, the power which they had in the</HI> interregnum, <HI>before they crowned him king, devolv|ing to them again. But there are but few miscarriages which bring the matter to this state. After considering it well on all sides, I can find but two. Two cases there are, I say, whereby a king,</HI> ipso facto, <HI>becomes no king, and loses all power and regal authority over his people; which are also taken notice of by</HI> Winzerus.</P>
<P><HI>The first is, If he endeavour to overturn the government, that is, if he have a purpose and design to ruin the kingdom and commonwealth, as it is recorded of</HI> Nero, <HI>that he re|solved to cut off the senate and people of</HI> Rome, <HI>lay the city waste with fire and sword, and then remove to some other place. And of</HI> Caligula, <HI>that he openly declared, that he would be no longer a head to the people or senate, and that he had it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his thoughts to cut off the worthiest men of both ranks, and then retire to</HI> Alexandria: <HI>and he wisht that the people had but one neck, that he might dispatch them all at a blow. Such designs at these, when any king har|bours in his thoughts, and seriously promotes, he immediate|ly gives up all care and thought of the common-wealth; and consequently forfeits the power of governing his sub|jects, as a master does the dominion over his slaves whom he hath abandoned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The other case is, When a king makes himself the depen|dent of another, and subjects his kingdom which his ance|stors left him, and the people put free into his hands, to the dominion of another: for however perhaps it may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be his intention to prejudice the people; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et because he has hereby lost the principal part of regal dignity,</HI> viz. <HI>to be next and immediately under God, supreme in his kingdom; and also because he betrayed or forced his people, whose li|berty he ought to have carefully preserved, into the power and dominion of a foreign nation. By this, as it were, alienation of his kingdom, he himself loses the power he had in it before, without transferring any the least right to those on whom he would have bestowed it; and so by this act s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts the people free, and leaves them at their own disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l. One example of this is to be found in the</HI> Scotch <HI>Annals.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>In these cases <HI>Barclay,</HI> the great champion of absolut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> monarchy, is forced to allow, that a king may be <HI>resisted,</HI> and <HI>ceases to be a king.</HI> That is, in shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not to multi|tiply cases, in whatsoever he has <HI>no authority,</HI> there he
<PB N="127" REF="012834_0126_0F8B3FE4415BBF70">
is <HI>no king,</HI> and may be <HI>resisted</HI>: for wheresoever the <HI>au|thority ceases, the king ceases too,</HI> and becomes like other men who have no authority. And these two cases he instances in, differ little from those above mentioned, to be destructive to governments, only that he has omitted the principle from which his doctrine flows; and that is, the breach of trust, in not preserving the form of go|vernment agreed on, and in not intending the end of government itself, which is the public good and preser|vation of property. When a king has dethroned him|self, and put himself in a state of war with his people, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no king, as they would any other man, who has put him|self into a state of war with them; <HI>Barclay,</HI> and those of his opinion, would do well to tell us. This farther I desire may be taken notice of out of <HI>Barclay,</HI> that he says, <HI>The mischief that is designed them, the people may prevent before it be done</HI>: whereby he allows <HI>resistance</HI> when tyranny is but in design. <HI>Such designs as these</HI> (says he) <HI>when any king harbours in his thoughts and se|riously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and thought of the common-wealth</HI>; so that, according to him, the neglect of the public good is to be taken as an evi|dence of such <HI>design,</HI> or at least for a sufficient cause of <HI>resistance.</HI> And the reason of all, he gives in these words, <HI>Because he betrayed or forced his people, whose liberty he ought carefully to have preserved.</HI> What he adds, <HI>into the power and dominion of a foreign nation,</HI> signifies nothing, the fault and forfeiture lying in the loss of their <HI>liberty,</HI> which he <HI>ought to have preserved,</HI> and not in any distinction of the persons to whose do|minion they were subjected. The peoples right is equal|ly invaded, and their liberty lost, whether they are made slaves to any of their own, or a <HI>foreign nation;</HI> and in this lies the injury, and against this only have they the right of defence. And there are instances to be found in all countries, which shew, that it is not the change of nations in the persons of their governors, but the change of government, that gives the offence. <HI>Bilson,</HI> a bishop of our church&punc; and a great stickler for the power and prerogative of princes, does, if I mistake not, in his treatise of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">istian subjection,</HI> acknowledge, that <HI>princes may f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">feit their power,</HI> and their title to the obedience of their subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and if there needed au|thority
<PB N="128" REF="012834_0127_0F8B3FE4EDAD38D8">
in a case where reason is so plain, I could s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd my reader to <HI>Brac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, Fortes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>&punc; and the author of <HI>the Mirrou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, writers that cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our government, or enemies to it. But I thought <HI>Hooker</HI> alone might be enough to satisfy those men, who relying on him for their ecclesiastical polity, are by a strange fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e carried to deny those prin|ciples upon which he builds it. Whether they are here|in made the tools of cunninger workmen, to pull down their own fabrick, they were best look. This I am sure, their civil policy is so new, so dangerous, and so destruc|tive to both rulers and people, that as former ages never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped, those to come, redeemed from the impositions of these <HI>Egyptian</HI> under-task masters, will abhor the memory of such servile flatterers, who, whilst it seemed to serve their turn, resolved all government into absolute tyranny, and would have all men born to, what their mean souls fitted them for, slavery.</P>
<P>Here it is like, the common question will be made, <HI>Who shall be judge,</HI> whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust? This, perhaps, ill-affected and factious men may spread among the people, when the prince only makes use of his due prerogative. To this I reply, <HI>The people shall be judge</HI>; for who shall be <HI>judge</HI> whether his trustee or deputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him, but he who deputes him, and must, by having deputed him&punc; have still a power to dis|card him, when he fails in his trust? If this be reasona|ble in particular cases of private men, why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment, where the wel|fare of millions is concerned, and also where the evil, if not prevented, is greater, and the redress very difficult, dear, and dangerous?</P>
<P>But farther, this question, <HI>(Who shall be judge?)</HI> can|not mean, that there is no judge at all: for where there is no judicature on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, <HI>God</HI> in heaven is <HI>judge.</HI> He alone, it is true, is judge of the right. But <HI>every man</HI> is <HI>judge</HI> for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whe|ther he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tha</HI> did.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="012834_0128_0F8B3FE5A0588480">If a controversy arise betwixt a prince and some of the people, in a matter where the law is silent, or doubtful, and the thing&punc; be of great consequence, I should think the proper <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpire,</HI> in such a case, should be the body of the <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple</HI>: for in cases where the prince hath a trust re|posed in him, and is dispensed from the common ordinary rules of the law; there, if any men find themselves ag|grieved, and think the prince acts contrary to, or beyond that trust, who so proper to <HI>judge</HI> as the body of the <HI>peo|ple,</HI> (who&punc; at first, lodged that trust in him) how far they meant it should extend? But if the prince, or whoever they be in the administration, decline that way of deter|mination, the appeal then lies no where but to heaven; force between either persons, who have no known supe|riour on earth, or which permits no appeal to a judge on earth, being properly a state of war, wherein the appeal lies only to heaven; and in that state the <HI>injured party must judge</HI> for himself when he will think fit to make use of that appeal, and put himself upon it.</P>
<P>To conclude, The <HI>power that every individual gave the society,</HI> when he entered into it, can never revert to the individuals again, as long as the society lasts, but will always remain in the community; because without this there can be no community; no commonwealth, which is contrary to the original agreement: so also when the society hath placed the legislative in any assembly of men, to continue in them and their successors, with direction and authority for providing such successors, <HI>the legislative can never revert to the people</HI> whilst that government lasts; be|cause having provided a legislative with power to continue forever, they have given up their political power to the legislative, and cannot resume it. But if they have set li|mits to the duration of their legislative, and made this supreme power in any person, or assembly, only tempo|rary; or else, when by the miscarriages of those in au|thority, it is forfeited; upon the forfeiture, or at the de|termination of the time set, <HI>it reverts to the society,</HI> and the people have a right to act as supreme, and continue the legislative in themselves; or erect a new form, or under the old form place it in new hands, as they think good.</P>
