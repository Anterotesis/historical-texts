<HEAD>A true and exact Relation of the late prodigious Earth|quake and Eruption of the Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> or <HI>Monte-Gibello,</HI> as it came in a Letter written to His Ma|jesty from <HI>Naples,</HI> by the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Winchilsea,</HI> His Majesties late Ambassador at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who in his return from thence, vi|sited <HI>Catania,</HI> and was an Eye-witness of that dread|full Spectacle.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my Voyage from <HI>Malta</HI> to this place, wherein I have used all the diligence the season hath given me leave, I touched at the City of <HI>Catania</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and was there most kindly invited by the Bishop to lodge in his Palace, which I accepted, that so I might be the better able to inform Your Majesty of that extraordi|nary Fire, which comes from Mount <HI>Gibel 15</HI> miles distant from that City; which for its horridness in the aspect, for the vast quantity thereof, (for it is <HI>15</HI> miles in length, and <HI>7</HI> in breadth) for its monstrous devastation, and quick pro|gress, may be termed an Inundation of Fire, a Flood of Fire, Cinders, and burning Stones, burning with that Rage as to advance into the Sea <HI>600</HI> yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I saw; and that which did augment my
<PB N="4" REF="000139_0003_0FA262385C6C7188">
admiration was, to see in the Sea this matter like ragged rocks, burning in four fathom water, two fathom higher then the Sea it self, some parts liquid and moving, and throwing off, not without great violence, the stones about it, which like a crust of a vast bigness, and red hot, fell into the Sea every moment, in some place or other, causing a great and horrible noise, smoak, and hissing in the Sea; and thus more and more coming after it, making a firm foundation in the Sea it self. I stayed there from nine a Clock on Saturday morning, to seven the next morning, and this Mountain of Fire and Stones, with Cinders, had advanced into the Sea <HI>20</HI> yards at least in several places; in the middle of this Fire which burn'd in the Sea, it hath formed a passage like to a River, with its banks on each side very steep and craggy, and in this Channel moves the greatest quantity of this Fire, which is the most liquid, with Stones of the same composition, and Cinders all red hot, swimming upon the Fire of a great magnitude; from this River of Fire doth proceed under the great Mass of the Stones which are generally three fathom high all over the Country, where it burns and in other places much more, there are secret Conduits or Rivulets of this liquid matter, which communicates fire and heat into all parts more or less, and melts the Stones and Cinders by fits in those pla|ces where it toucheth them, over and over again; where it meets with Rocks or Houses of the same matter (as many are) they melt and go away with the fire; where they finde other compositions they turn them to lime or ashes, (as I am in|formed.) The composition of this Fire, Stones and Cinders, are <HI>Sulphur, Nitre, Quicksilver, Sal-Armoniac, Lead, Iron, Brass,</HI> and all other Mettals. It moves not regularly,
<PB N="5" REF="000139_0004_0FA2623988AB5858">
nor constantly down Hill; in some places it hath made the Valleys Hills, and the Hills that are not high are now Val|leys. When it was night I went upon two Towers in divers places, and could plainly see at ten miles distance, as we judged, the Fire to begin to run from the Mountain in a di|rect line, the flame to ascend as high and as big as one of the highest and greatest Steeples in your Majesties Kingdomes, and to throw up great Stones into the Air; I could discern the River of Fire to descend the Mountain of a terrible fiery or red colour, and stones of a paler Red, to swim thereon, and to be, some as big as an ordinary Table. We could see this fire to move in several other places, and all the Country covered with Fire, ascending with great Flames, in many places, smoaking like to a violent furnace of Iron melted, making a noise with the great pieces that fell, especially those which fell into the Sea. A Cavalier of <HI>Malta,</HI> who lives there, and attended me, told me, that the River was as liquid where it issues out of the Mountain, as water, and came out like a Torrent with great violence, and is five or six fa|thom deep, and as broad, and that no stones do sink therein. I assure your Majesty, no Pen can express how terrible it is, nor can all the Art and Industry of the world quench, or di|vert that which is burning in the Country. In <HI>40</HI> dayes time it hath destroyed the Habitations of <HI>27</HI> thousand persons, made two Hills of one, <HI>1000</HI> paces high apiece, and one is four miles in compass, as your Majesty will see by the draught that I take the boldness to send herewith; it was the best I could get, but hath nothing of the progress into the Sea; the confusion was so great in the City, which is almost surrounded with Mountains of Fire, that I could not get any to draw

one, but I have taken care to have one sent after me for your Majesty. Of <HI>20000</HI> persons which inhabited <HI>Catania, 3000</HI> did onely remain; all their goods are carried away, the Cannons of Brass are removed out of the Castle, some great Bells taken down, the City-Gates Walled up next the Fire, and preparation made all to abandon the City.</P>
<P>That night which I lay there, it rained Ashes all over the City, and ten miles at Sea it troubled my Eyes. This Fire in its progress met with a <HI>Lake</HI> of four miles in compass, and it was not onely satisfied to fill it up, though it was four fa|thom deep, but hath made of it a <HI>Mountain.</HI></P>
<P>I send also to your <HI>Sacred Majesty</HI> a <HI>Relation</HI> in Print which the <HI>Bishop</HI> gave me, wherein the Beginning is rela|ted, and several curious Passages.

<HEAD>A Particular NARRATIVE Of the late Dreadfull Earthquake and Eruption, As it is Collected out of several Relations from CATANIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOunt Aetna,</HI> or <HI>Monte Gibello,</HI> a Mountain so Renowned throughout the World for its height and greatness, but much more for those Prodigious Flames, Smoak, and Ashes which it hath cast out from the top of it, whilst the other parts are continually (even in the midst of Summer) co|ver'd with Snow, has been for many Ages observ'd once, or sometimes oftner, in the space of about fifteen years, to throw up more then ordinary Flames, with much Smoak and Stones, and great quantities of Ashes&punc; which (though terrible to the neighbouring Towns and Villages) was yet wont, in little time, to abate of its fury, and prove but seldom more injurious to the Coun|try near it, then by communicating largely its ashes, which though for the present it did somewhat incom|mode them, they had afterwards a considerable Com|pensation
<PB N="8" REF="000139_0007_0FA2623E674DE7A8">
in the product of their Lands, which by this means were render'd more fruitful.</P>
<P>But on Friday the 18/8 of <HI>March</HI> 1669. the Sun was ob|served before its setting to appear of a pale and dead co|lour, which (being contrary to what it ever before ap|peared to us) struck no small terrour into the inhabi|tants, all Objects appearing also of the same colour, with a paleness received from that of the Sun. The same night happened in this City, as well as the whole Country hereabouts, a terrible and unusual Earthquake, whose strong and unequal motions, joyned with horri|ble Roarings from <HI>Monte Gibello,</HI> exceedingly frighted the inhabitants, but was so extraordinarily violent in the Country adjacent, that the people were forced to aban|don their Houses, and to fly into the fields to avoid the danger threatned them from the falling of their Houses. The village of <HI>Nicolosi</HI> was of all others the most dread|fully handled by this furious Earthquake, the Houses and other buildings being shaken all in pieces, and bu|ried in their own Ruines, the poor people (who had pre|served their lives by a timely flight, with such little of their Goods as their hasty fears would permit them to carry out with them) continued a night or two in the fields, beholding with grief and astonishment the ruine of their Habitations; but observing that by these vio|lent Concussions, the Earth began to open in several pla|ces, and to threaten them with inevitable ruine, they fled, though with much trouble and amazement, to this City. These shakings of the Earth being so frequent and violent, that the people went reeling and staggering&punc;
<PB N="9" REF="000139_0008_0FA262413217D658">
with such difficulty supporting one another from fal|ling, insomuch as what with their want of sleep, the pains they were forced to take in travelling, and the great terrours imprinted on them by what they had seen and suffered, they appeared at their arrival in this City, as so many distracted people, wholly insensible of what they did.</P>
<P>This dreadful convulsion of the Earth was immediate|ly followed on Monday <HI>March</HI> 11. about ten at night by three terrible Eruptions, much about the same time, and at little distance one from the other.</P>
<P>These said Eruptions were observed to be on the side of <HI>Monte Gibello,</HI> about two miles beyond the Mountain called <HI>Montpileri,</HI> from whence with a terrible noise it threw its up flames with much fury and violence about an hundred yards in height, its noise not roaring onely in|wards from the Belly of the Mountain as before, but violently cracking like Peals of Ordnance or Thunder, from the side of it throwing out vast stones, some of them of 300 pound weight, which being (as it were) shot through the Air, fell several miles distant from the place, whilst the whole Air was filled with smoak, burn|ing Cinders, and Ashes, which fell like a fiery Rain upon the Country.</P>
<P>In the mean time issued from the side of this Prodi|gious Mountain, a vast Torrent of Melted and burning Matter; which, like an Inundation, drowned, as in a Flood of Fire, the Country on this side of it.</P>
<P>This burning River ran down upon the Mountain <HI>Montpileri,</HI> which, opposing its direct course, it divided
<PB N="10" REF="000139_0009_0FA26242D019F2C0" MS="y">
it self into two streams, which encompassed the said Mountain&punc; one of them taking its way by <HI>La Guardia,</HI> the <HI>Convent</HI> of <HI>St. Anne,</HI> and <HI>Malposfo,</HI> the other by the Towns of <HI>Montpilori</HI> and <HI>Falicchi,</HI> which in few hours were wholly destroyed and lost, not so much as any sign of them remaining, with several lesser villa|ges and Farms, and with them the famous Image of the blessed Lady of the <HI>Annunciata</HI>; which, though highly reverenced throughout the whole Island, esteem|ed the Wonder of <HI>Sicily</HI> and the whole World, and to which the people with much Devotion resorted in Pil|grimage from the remotest parts, was also swallowed up and consumed by this dreadful Torrent.</P>
<P>This fiery and burning Deluge immediately spread it self to above six miles in breadth, seeming to be some|what of the colour of melted and burning Glass; but, as it cools, becomes hard and rocky, and every where in its passage leaves Hills and Pyramids of that Matter be|hinde it.</P>
<P>At the same time <HI>Monte Gibello</HI> from its top raged with dreadful Flames, which with its noise and concussions of the Earth still continuing, added not a little to the terrour of the people, who ran with Cries and Lamentations a|bout the City and Country, expecting nothing but to be swallowed up, or consumed by fire, having no other ap|prehensions but of death, and a general Conflagration.</P>
<P>The two Torrents of Fire forward, destroying all things in their way, and by Wednesday, March 13. had on the West-side branched it self into several streams, and over-ran <HI>Campo Rotundo,</HI> S. <HI>Pietro,</HI> and <HI>Mostorbianco,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="000139_0010_0FA26242E03D5B60" MS="y">
with <HI>La Potielli,</HI> and S. <HI>Antonino</HI>; and on the East part ruin'd the lower part of <HI>Mascalucia,</HI> and <HI>Le Placchi,</HI> taking its way towards this City.</P>
<P>On Thursday the 14th the Wind came Eastwards, on which day fell abundance of Rain, which abated not the progress of the Fire; which on the East-side had from <HI>Mascalucia</HI> made its way to S. <HI>Giovanni di Galermo,</HI> the lower part whereof it destroyed; and passing on, seem'd to threaten this City on one side, as did that on the West-side the other.</P>
<P>As the Fire approached, the Religious every where appeared with much Devotion, carrying in Procession their Reliques, especially those of S. <HI>Agatha,</HI> the famous Martyr of <HI>Catania,</HI> in which they reposed no small con|fidence, followed by great multitudes of people, some of them mortifying themselves vvith Whips, and other signs of Pennance, vvith great complaints and cries, ex|pressing their dreadful expectation of the Events of those prodigious fiery Inundations.</P>
<P>Whilst the people were thus busied in their Devotions&punc; and astonisht by their fears, News vvas brought to the Magistrates of the City, that a considerable number of Thieves and Robbers had taken the opportunity of this general Distraction, to make a prey of the already di|stressed people, and that they had Murdered several of them for their Goods; and that it vvas to be feared, that the City of <HI>Catania</HI> it self might run some danger from the great numbers of them vvhich vvere about the Coun|try, and from thence took their opportunities to get into the Town. Whereupon, consultation being had for the
<PB N="12" REF="000139_0011_0FA26243C470A090">
prevention of further mischief from them, the Com|mander of the Castle vvas ordered vvith a considerable number of Horse, and a party of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to secure the Country and City against these Robbers; vvho imme|diately sent out several parties vvith his Provost Mar|shal, with Order to seize on all suspected persons, and such as vvere not able to give a good account of themselves: and, for such as vvere taken in the Fact robbing, to Exe|cute them by Martial-Law, vvithout any further Triall; and accordingly caused three pair of Gallows to be set up for their speedy Execution; one before the Gate <HI>Di Aci,</HI> a second in the Market-place, and a third before the Gate <HI>Della Decima,</HI> setting strong Guards upon the Gates of the City, and causing all suspected Houses to be searched, an account to be given in of all Lodgers, and such persons to be secured, as could any vvayes fall un|der a suspition.</P>
<P>The poor people out of the Country being by this prodigious Calamity stript out of all their Estates, and reduced to great extremity, fled most of them for refuge and relief to this City, vvith great Lamentations moving the Charity of the Magistrates, vvhich vvas readily in|clined to give them the best assistance they vvere able; and the Citizens, moved by their Complaints and Suf|ferings, freely open'd their doors, filling their Houses vvith as many of those distressed people, as they could possibly receive; the Bishop, and all persons of Quality and Estate contributing largely for their support, till bet|ter Order could be taken for the disposing of them.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Messina</HI> also, and several other Cities
<PB N="13" REF="000139_0012_0FA26244745D8868" MS="y">
(informed of this extraordinary Calamity) sent hither large supplies of Provisions, offering their best assistance to this place, in case of extremity.</P>
<P>All the Elements seemed at this time to make War up|on us, and to conspire together for the punishment of the Inhabitants: The Air was continually darkened with Clouds and Smoak, agitated by great and violent winds, and oftentimes showred down great Rains, insomuch as the Sun from the beginning of these Eruptions, very sel|dome appeared to us, and when it did, (with extraordina|ry paleness) for a little time onely, and (as it were, abhor|ring so dreadful a spectacle) soon hid its face again un|der a thick Cloud.</P>
<P>The Sea ran much higher then it was wont to do, and by its extraordinary roaring, and in some places over|flowing its banks, added not a little to our consternation. The Land every where infested with Thieves, insomuch, that till by the extraordinary care taken by the Magi|strates and Officers, severe execution was done upon such as were apprehended in the Fact, no person was able to stir abroad without danger of his life; whilst the Fire by this prodigious overflowing of the Mountain, threatned to take possession of all.</P>
<P>On Friday the 15th, the stream of fiery Matter which destroyed the lower part of S. <HI>Giovanni de Galerma,</HI> di|vided it self into two parts, one of its branches taking its way toward <HI>Mosterbianco,</HI> the other threatning the City of <HI>Catania,</HI> but this last was observed to move with more slowness then before, having in 24 hours time scarcely gained 20 paces.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000139_0013_0FA262452A1767E8" MS="y">On the 18th, being Monday, the Torrents being still seen to draw nearer and nearer to this City, the Senate with Monsegnior <HI>Cambuchi</HI> the Bishop of this place, fol|lowed by all the Clergy Secular and Regular, and an in|finite number of people went in a solemn Procession out of this City to <HI>Monte de St. Sofia,</HI> carrying out with greatest Devotion their choicest Reliques, and upon an Altar erected in view of the Mountain, exposed them, where they celebrated Mass, and used the Exorcisms ac|customed upon such extraordinary occasions; all which time, the Mountain ceased not as before with excessive roaring to throw up its smoak and flames with extraor|dinary violence, and abundance of great stones, which were carried through the Air, some of them falling within their view, though at ten miles distance from the Eruption; the Ashes which proceeded from thence were scattered in great abundance, as well on this City as on the Country adjacent, every where in the Fields with cin|ders, and the heat of the said ashes destroying the Grass, which obliged the people to drive away their cattel to a further distance, which would otherwise have perished for want of food.</P>
<P>These streams of ruine daily crept nearer and nearer to this City, but by uneven and irregular motions, ac|cording as it was more or less supplied from its fountain; but on Wednesday the 20th, we perceived that that branch of it which seemed most to threaten this City from S. <HI>Giovanni di Galermo</HI> was wholly extinguisht, and the other which bent its course towards <HI>Mosterbianco</HI> ran but slowly, and gave us some hopes that its fury was also
<PB N="15" REF="000139_0014_0FA26245E7C77CA8">
near spent, but the other Torrent which had before over|flown <HI>Mosterbianco,</HI> continued its motion with as much violence as ever, being in breadth above a Musket shot over; but in probability could not easily overflow to the Westwards, which was defended by its rocky scituation; another branch vvhich ran by S. <HI>Pietro</HI> vvas observed to be much larger then the rest, and its stream more quick and active, but meeting with some opposition in its way, it made some stop, onely sending out a Rivolet toward the Eastwards about three or four yards vvide, of its most subtile and active matter, vvhich directed its course towards a small village about a furlong distant from its main stream; another branch threatned <HI>Campo Rotundo,</HI> but bent its course Westwards towards the Farm of <HI>Val|corrente,</HI> vvhere its fiery body vvas scattered into several deep and rocky places, vvithout any considerable da|mage.</P>
<P>About this time vve had hopes that the violence of this Eruption had been over, the Mountain not throwing out its flames vvith that violence as before, and its noise and roaring in a great measure ceased.</P>
<P>Those vvho at nearest distance took a view of the Mountain, informed, that the top of it vvas fallen in, and the Mountain supposed to vvant near a mile of its former height; that the largest of the Mouthes from vvhence these fiery streams vvere vented, vvas about half a mile in compass, but the view of this dreadful In|undation carried so much terrour in it as they vvere not able to express; from all these Mouthes vvere vomited Rivers of a thick and fiery substance of stone and Me|tals
<PB N="16" REF="000139_0015_0FA26246AF5F4DD8">
melted, whose depth vvas various according to the several places it filled in its passage, in some places 4, in others 8, 12 or 15 yards and upwards: its breadth in some places six miles, in others much more; its flame like that of Brimstone, and its motion like that of Quick|silver; advancing ordinarily very slowly, unless where it was provoked by the addition of a fresh Torrent, or some considerable descent. Wheresoever it passed, it left large heaps of its congealed matter, with which it covered and burnt the Earth, melting the Walls of Ca|stles and Houses, throwing down and consuming all be|fore it, nothing being yet found able to resist its force, nor any thing able to quench its burning, Water being observed rather to adde to its fury; vvheresoever it has passed, it has left its dreadful marks behind it, levelling some Hills and raising others, so much changing the scituation, that not the least trace of any place or Town remains, nothing being to be seen but confused heaps of ragged stone, vvhich yielding a noisome fume, strikes terrour and astonishment into all that behold it.</P>
<P>On Friday the 22, the Mountain again roared with much loudness, and threw up from its Mouthes a vast quantity of matter, which formed two large Hills higher and larger then that of <HI>Montpileri,</HI> with a large bank of the same matter to the eastwards, sending down a vio|lent stream of its liquid matter towards <HI>Malpasso,</HI> much enlarging the former current, and passing thence to <HI>Campo Rotundo</HI> and S. <HI>Pietro,</HI> compleated the ruines of those Towns, driving furiously towards <HI>Mosterbianco</HI>; the other stream by S. <HI>Giovanni di Galermo</HI> being wholly diverted and extinguisht.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="000139_0016_0FA262476F313510">From this time till the 25th, the Mountain continued silent, but then it burst out again with more force then ever before, its noise much louder, like Peals of Ord|nance, and so forcible and lasting, as for 24 hours it caused a shaking and trembling in our buildings, the Air so filled with smoak and ashes, as darkned the face of the sky.</P>
<P>The Birds and Fowl about this time, either through vvant of food, or illness of Air, vvhich vvas corrupted with the noisome smells arising from these burnings, were observed to lye dead in all places.</P>
<P>On the 28th the grand Current was advanced near the City as far as the old <HI>Capucins,</HI> which struck so great a terrour into the people, that most of them left the City, only some Officers remaining with such persons as vvere under their command, vvho have secured and sent away the Magazine, and all the Artillery from the Castle.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="000139_0017_0FA26248ECEB6B90">
it came towards <HI>Sardanello,</HI> where all the remainder of the In|habitants of this City were Spectators of it, which resembled a River of melted and burning Brass, about ten Ells wide, run|ning with swiftness to the Arch of <HI>Marcus Marcellus,</HI> a Fa|mous Piece of Antiquity, and passing under it ruin'd about six Ells of it, which was the breadth of the Current in that place: from thence it ran to <HI>Madonna di Monserrato,</HI> which it wholly destroyed: then falling down to <HI>Madonna delle Gratie,</HI> it entred in at one Gate, and passed through another, without any consi|derable hurt, and running through the Gate <HI>Della Decima</HI>&punc; filled all the Plaine <HI>Di Schiara Viva,</HI> where it was above 6 Ells deep. Then taking its way towards the Bulwark, on the Sea|side, under the Castle of this City, it ran by, two Ells deep into the Sea; in which (to the great wonder of all that saw it) it has made its Progress a mile in length, and as much in breadth, and is drawing towards the Gate of the Channel, which gives us great Apprehensions, lest it may that way In|vade the City it self: Nor is there less Danger on the side <HI>Del Tindaro,</HI> where there runs a great Torrent of the same Active matter, which draws near, and seems to threaten the Walls, and is in that place about a mile in breadth, having over-flowed and destroyed all the Gardens, from the Gate <HI>Della Decima,</HI> as farr as <HI>Madonna delli Amellati.</HI></P>
