<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>INGRATITUDE towards men, after signal favo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> received, is, amongst all civilized people, look+ed upon with a just detestation; insomuch th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the moral Gentiles, in ages past, thought they could give no worser character of a person, than to call him ungrateful: How much more then are christians (especially in a time of such light as now shineth) engaged to shun this sin of ingra|titude towards their GOD, whom they sensibly know to be the fountain of all their mercies? And surely, next to the infinite mercy shewed them for Christ's sake, in causing the day spring fromon high to visit their souls, remarkable outward deliverances ought, in a more than commonly remarkable man|ner, to be the objects of their gratitude to their great deliverer. I must confess, Thanksgiving (which is what we poor mortals can return, for the manifold favours we daily receive from him) hath its rise in the heart; and as out of the abun|dance of the heart the mouth speaketh, how can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ose who are truly thankful in heart, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> calves of their lips, in telling to their friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaintance, how great things GOD h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them! nay, they are so affected with such e|minen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="iv" REF="025393_0004_0FCD1504628CC9A0">
appearances of the protecting hand of providence for their help, preservation and deli|verance, that they are not willing to confine it to them only, but to publish it to the world, that the fame of their GOD may be spread from sea to sea, and from one end of the earth to the other.</P>
<P>The following relation being large, I shall en|deavor to be short; only, some of the things which seem to be most remarkable, I would more particularly recommend to the reader's observation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The hearts of all men are in the hands of GOD, he can turn them as he pleases. When these men-eaters was at height, their knives in one hand, hand &amp; the poor shipwreck'd peoples heads in the other, their knees upon their shoulders, and their looks dismal; on a sudden, the Savages were struck dumb, and their countenances changed, that they look'd like other people; the Cassekey (or King) becoming as a safeguard to the distressed, from the injuries of his own men: Yea, such confidence put he in them, that he would trust them to re|move the money he had taken from themselves, before he would trust his own people. When they were got from these to another place, where they expected more safety, they found themselves disappointed, fresh dangers presenting themselves as dismally as before; yet GO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prevented any further mischief, than the stripping them of those poor rags the other had left them, and some other abu|ses, which by that time were grown familiar to them, and were look'd upon as light afflictions: The Cassekey's wife being made an instrument
<PB N="v" REF="025393_0005_0FCD1505DE39ABC0">
for their delivery, she, and some others, having something of tenderness of heart in them, though among such an inhuman crew.</P>
<P N="2">2 Many were the particular deliverances, upon occasion of injuries offered: Once an arrow shot at them, narrowly escaped them: Another time, some going to shoot arrows at them, certain of their own company caught hold of their bows and arms; yea, though some of them shot, yet their arrows mist. Not to mention the frequent dan|gers they were in, upon every slight suspicion of their being English; of which, more anon. And well might these poor sufferers be in continual fear of their lives, since about a twelve-month be|fore, a parcel of Dutch-men who had likewise suffered ship-wreck, had been killed and devour|ed; and moreover, of the many vessels supposed to be lost on that coast, these are the first company that were known to have escaped. Neither is it so wonderful, that they are thus cruel to strangers, since they are unnatural to their own aged people; they having no more compassion on them, than to make them slaves to the younger. Yet are these men-eaters as cowardly as cruel; when the Span|iards came up the sight of a rusty musket present|ed towards them, would make several of them fly.</P>
<P N="3">3 The dangers they were delivered from, arose not only from men, but the elements also, which God permitted to threaten and afflict them. One time rowing in their boat, the sea swell'd so that it was dangerous continuing there all night, and as dangerous to endeavor for the shore; yet provi|dence
<PB N="v" REF="025393_0006_0FCD15083937F300">
failed them not, but conducted them safe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hither, as though there had been a lane made through the breakers. Another time, by reason of a great flood, they were forced to remove their lodgings several times, and for divers days were in a continual apprehension of being drowned; at length they were preserved on an oyster hill. Not lo mention the frequent dangers they were in, by reason of the extreme cold, too tedious to touch on here; wherein this however is remarkable, that God can both administer strength in the midst of weakness, and also take away strength, and cause weakness to seize, whenever he pleases: Here was an old man, a woman with a sucking child, and a|nother with child, persons seemingly very unlike|ly to encounter such hardships, all escaped; and yet divers Negroes, used to more hardships, per|ished.</P>
<P N="4">4 As to lodging, I shall say little; any discreet person may imagine how hard it was to people well brought up, to lie on a floor swarming with abundance of many sorts of creeping things, occa|sioned by throwing the berry-stones on the floor, &amp; letting all the nastiness they made, lie there, which bred these vermin; and yet perhaps might be accounted good lodging, in comparison of the cold ground whereon they often lay afterwards unshel|tered, exposed to the bleak blasts of the rigid north-west wind.</P>
<P N="5">5 Their food most scanty, the best of it such, as (I am ready to think) the meanest Negro here would not touch with his lips; sometimes the gills
<PB N="vii" REF="025393_0007_0FCD150AD84CAC30">
and guts of fish pick'd off a dung hill; sometimes the scraps the Indians flung away, and the water they boiled their fish in, though never so unde|cently handled. At first their sorrows were so great and their alarms so many, that they could not eat, afterwards their diet so uncouth, they could not away with it; until, at length, hunger had so far prevailed over them, that they could eat with an appetite the palmetto-berries: the taste whereof was once irksome, and ready to take away their breath; yea so fond were they of them, that the getting of about a bushel accidentally, was looked on as a great prize.</P>
<P N="6">6 Their being forced to mask themselves under the name of Spaniards, though few of them could speak any Spanish, was an oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r hardship&punc; mostly because the natives often suspected them to be English, and thereby they were continually in dan|ger of their lives. Whether their cruelty against the English proceeds from their being under no apprehension of danger from them, and so may think themselves lawless in what they do against our nation; or whether it proceeds from any par|ticular disgust offered them by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me English, I shall not determine: Howeve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it would do well for those that are not under their power, to avoid giving them any just cause of offence, lest their neighbors suffer for their faults. One of these Savages could complain, That some years past, he had been taken off by some of our English sloops, from whom he escaped by swimming; and was therewith disgusted, insomuch, that could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

by his sifting, have found out that they were En|glish, it might have proved of ill consequence to them.</P>
<P N="7">7. The courtesy of the Governour of Augustine, who cloathed these naked people, fed their hungry stomachs, and caused them to be conducted safely to Carolina, is not to be passed by without due notice; especially being a man of another nation, as well as of a different religion; and what is more of such an one as doth not teach its votaries so much compassion towards those they count Here|ticks: Neither let me forget the Governor of Ca|rolina, whose generosity compleated what the Go|vernor of Augustine had begun, in assisting and cherishing these our afflicted friends and country folks; with which I shall conclude these remarks to treat more particularly concerning that faithful servant of the Lord, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> who was one of this company.</P>
<P>This man of GOD, whose habitation was in one of the northern counties of England, was early convinced of the blessed truth of GOD, professed by the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and soon after had a dispensation of the gospel committed to him.&mdash; He lived in his native country, in esteem amongst his neighbors, for his godly conversation, and ho|nored in the church of GOD, as an elder, who had abode faithful in his testimony, both in preaching the gospel, suffering for the same, and behaving himself answerable thereto. And in the year 1694, the spirit of GOD (from whom he first had his commission) requiring him to come over into
<PB N="ix" REF="025393_0009_0FCD150D97F03068">
these parts, to preach the gospel here also, he was not disobedient to the heavenly call, but gave up to do the will of GOD, tho' in a cross to his own, as appeared by an expression of his before he left England, which was to this effect: That he had rather immediately have laid down his natural life there, if by so doing he could have kept his peace with GOD, than to have crossed the seas to Ame|rica. Well, hither he came; and after he had thoroughly visited these parts, he took ship for the West-India Islands; and at length, was re|turning from Jamaica to this town of Philadelphia &mdash;when these calamities, mentioned in the ensuing Journal, befel him: How he behaved himself un|der them is therein expressed, with what patience he was carried through them, with what faith he overcame, even the very worst of men; so that it may be said, he was more than a conqueror over those blood thirsty Cannibals, looking to him who was invisible, and by his grace seeing beyond them and their cruelty; by prayer wrestling with GOD for a blessing, even the blessing of being deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red out of their barbarous hands, and laying his bones amongst faithful friends; and so effectual were his fervent prayers, that they prevailed with GOD, and so gracious was his GOD to him, that he seal|ed an assurance upon his spirit, that his prayers were heard, and should in due time be answered, before he was yet off his knees. And doubtless he was made a strength and a comfort to his compa|nions in affliction, whose remembrance will not be easily blotted out of their minds.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="025393_0010_0FCD150EF40761B8">One remarkable passage I cannot well omit, which demonstrates he had well learned of him who is a God of truth, to speak the truth upon all occa|sions, tho' with the hazard of his life. For, as the reader may observe in the series of this following relation, these poor people, for the safeguard of their lives, had assumed the name of Spaniards; some on that account, asserting what was wrong, others concealing the truth, yet this honest-hearted man, being directly asked the question, Nickaleer, Nic|kaleer? (their word for Englishmen) could do nei|ther, but in simplicity answered, Yes: Being asked so concerning another, he again answered, Yes. Yet, though for his plain dealing, he was stript of his clothes, which till then he had saved, God suf|fered not these savages to touch his life or the lives of any of his company.</P>
<P>Thus he passed through this afflicting trial, and at length arrived at this place on the 1st day of the second month, 1697, though in much weakness, ha|ving been taken very ill of the belly-ach and flux at Augustine, of which he never recovered, but still grew worse and worse to his dying day. It was a|bout the 8th hour in the evening when the Barken|tine he was passenger in, arrived at this place, and di|vers Friends went on board, in order to get him a|shore, but he being in a very weak condition, they could not remove him at that time. He declared, his great satisfaction that the Lord had granted his re|quest, that he might lay down his bones in this place &mdash;that his heart was strong, and he hoped he might first see Friends again at the meeting. He
<PB N="xi" REF="025393_0011_0FCD1510A8043B70">
made mention of the goodness of God to him, and that his presence had attended him in all his exercises.</P>
<P>The next morning, being the 2d of the 2d m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="4 letters"> divers Friends went on board to help the vessel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word"> to a wharf, in order to get him on shore; in which time he spake as before related, God's power atten|ding him. About the 7th hour, divers Friends car|ried him in a Hammock (being wrapt up in a blanket &amp; clothes to keep him warm) to the house of Samuel Carpenter, where he declared the good|ness of God to him, and that his heart was yet strong and his memory and understanding good. After which he was shifted and then slept some time.</P>
<P>On the same day, some Friends coming into the room to visit him, at the sight of them he seemed to rejoice, and putting forth his hand, was ready to embrace them in much love, and in a very tender frame of spirit. The Friends expressed their glad|ness to see him; but said, they were sorry to see him so very weak: To which he replied, Although my body be weak, my mind is sound, and memo|ry good. And further said, The Lord hath been very good to me along to this very day, and this morning hath sweetly refreshed me. And further added, The Lord hath answered my desire, for I desired content, and that I might come to this place to lay my bones amongst you. And after|wards said, It is a good thing to have a conscience void of offence, both towards God, and towards men.</P>
<P>On the 4th day of the second month, being the first day of the week, about the fifth hour in the morning, he desired a Friend to write for him to
<PB N="xii" REF="025393_0012_0FCD151225F15930">
his dear wife. To remember his dear love to her, and to let her know of his travels, and being here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the Lord was with him, that his outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> were settled, and that she had wherewithal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on. He further said, divers Friends being present, that the Lord was with him, and all things were well; and that he had nothing to do but to die: And accordingly on this day he departed; and on the 3d day following, being the 6th day of the second month was buried in Friends bury|ing-ground, in this town of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>And now, having brought my relation concern|ing this good man to the last period of his life, I might have very well have put a period to my pre|face: but that I foresee, some persons may be rea|dy to say, Here is an account of very strange passa|ges, but of what credit is the relator? May we de|pend upon his authority, without danger of being imposed upon? To such I answer, He is a man well known in this town, of good credit and re|pute; on whose fidelity and veracity, those who have any knowledge of him, will readily rely, without suspecting fallacy. But, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every thing may be esta|blished, besides him and his wife, a person whose residence (when at home) is in this town, Joseph Kirle, the master of the Barkentine in which they suffered shipwreck, a man of an honest character amongst his neighbours, had the perusal of it be|fore it went to the press, and approved it. With which I shall conclude, wishing my reader much satisfaction in the reading of it, but never the un|happiness of experiencing, in person, the truth of it.</P>

<P>The 23d day of the sixth month called August, 1696, being in company with twelve or thirteen sail of merchantmen, under convoy of the Hamp|shire frigate, Capt. Fletcher, commander, we sailed from Portroyal in Jamaica, being bound for Penn|sylvania.</P>
<P>The 24th day. About noon came a sloop from Portroyal, meeting us off Portland, and gave an

account of the French fleet being at Cape Antonio.</P>
<P>In the evening we lay by, off Black-river mouth in order to go the next morning to Blewfields, but it being calm for many days following, the current drove us to the westward of the island.</P>
<P>The 31st day. This evening we lost sight of the Hampshire frigate, and then beat to windward again.</P>
<P>The 1st day of the seventh month, called Sep|tember, we anchored to the westward of Savanna|la-mar, and lost our anchor.</P>
<P>The 2d day. This day we got into Blewfields road to water.</P>
<P>The 4th day. This morning we sailed from Blewfields, intending our passage thro' the gulph.</P>
<P>The 14th day. About noon we were abreast with Cape Antonio, and about a league to the east|ward of the Cape was a fire making a great smoak &mdash;at length some people appeared on the bay, ma|king signs for us to put on shore; but having a fresh gale, and not knowing who they were, our master would not.</P>
<P>The same day we made the table land of the Havanna, and in the evening stood over for Cape Florida: but about eight or nine at night we saw two lights about a mile from us, and we fearing we had got among the French fleet, tacked and stood for the haven.</P>
<P>The 18th day. This morning no sail appear|ing, and being most of the day calm, we lay about four leagues off the Havanna, where we design|ed
<PB N="3" REF="025393_0015_0FCD1516B64B1BE0">
to go and enquire concerning the French fleet; but in the afternoon came a tornado from the land, and our master being on the quarter-deck, our boom jybbing knocked him down and broke his leg, which accident was gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vious to him and us; but having things suitable with a little experience, we set it again. At this time I had four of my fa|mily very sick, one whereof was an Indian girl, who just as I had bound up the master's leg, was taken with fits, which continued some hours, and then she died. In the evening we stood over for Cape Floaida, having the wind north easterly.</P>
<P>The 19th day. This morning the wind not be|ing fair, we stood up for Cuba, and about sun|rising espied those sails that we saw before, they standing as we stood; therefore we supposed them to be some of our company: We wronged them in sailing, and by noon lost sight of them. About four in the afternoon we espied another ship to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eastward of us (we being about four leagues off shore and about fifteen leagues to the eastward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Havanna) and supposing her to be a French+man, we stood in for the shore, but she gained on us: Then a tornado sprang up, and a great shower of rain followed which hid us. Hereupon we tacked and stood over for Florida, and when night came on we saw no more of that sail, having the wind fair</P>
<P>The 20th day. This morning we were in the gulph, having a fair wind and saw again the two ships following us, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h we believed to be of our company.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025393_0016_0FCD151805C2BF28">The 21st day. This morning the wind at east and shifting notherly.</P>
<P>The 22d day. This day the storm began at the north-east.</P>
<P>The 23d day. About one o'clock in the morn|ing we felt our vessel strike some few strokes, and then she floated again for five or six minutes, be|fore she ran fast aground, where she beat vehement|ly at first. The wind was violent, and it was so very dark, that our mariners could see no land &amp; the sea broke over us, so that we were in a quarter of an hour floating in the cabin: We then endea|vored to get a candle lighted, which in a little time was accomplished.</P>
<P>By this time we felt the vessel not to strike so often; but several of her timbers were broken, and the seas continued breaking over us, and no land to be seen. We concluded to keep in the vessel as long as she would hold together, and about the third hour in the morning, we supposed we saw land at some considerable distance; at which time we found the water began to run out of her, and at day-light perceived we were upon the shore, on a beach ly|ing on the breach of the sea, which, at times, as the surges reversed, was dry. In taking a view of our vessel, we found that the violence of the wea|ther had forced many sorts of sea-birds on board of her some of which were, by force of the wind blown in|to and under our hen-coops, and many remained a|live. Our hogs and sheep were washed away, and swam on shore, except one of the hogs which re|mained in the vessel.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="025393_0017_0FCD15195DB0E038">We rejoiced at this our preservation from the raging seas, but at the same instant feared the sad consequences that followed; yet having hopes still, we got our sick and lame on shore also our provi|sions, with spars and sails to make a tent. I went with one negro to view the land, and seek the most convenient place for that purpose; but the wilder|ness country looked very dismal, having no trees, but only sand hills covered with shrubby palmetto, the stalks of which were prickly so that there was no walking amongst them: I at last espied a place, almost a furlong within the beach, being a bottom to which I with my Negro soon cut a pass|age, but the storm and rain continued. Thither I got my wife and sick child, who was but six months and twelve days old; also Robert Barrow an aged man, who had been sick about five or six months; our master, who some days before had broke his leg, and my kinsman Benjamin Allen, who had been very ill with a violent fever for most part of the voyage: These with others, we got to the place under the shelter of some few bushes, which broke off the wind, but kept none of the rain from them, but I got a fire made; and the rest of our people were getting the provisions a|shore; but our chests, trunks and clothing, were all very wet and cold.</P>
<P>About the eighth or ninth hour came two In|dian men (being naked except a small piece of plaited work of straws, which just hid their private parts' and fastened behind like a horse tail in like|ness, made of a sort of a silk grass) from the south|ward,
<PB N="6" REF="025393_0018_0FCD151CCE9838A8">
running fiercely and foaming at the mouth, having no weapors but their knives, and forthwith not making any stop, violently seized the two first of our men they met with, who were carrying corn from the vessel to the top of the bank, where I stood to receive it and put it into a cask; they used them not ill, as the men resisted not; but taking them under the arm brought them to|wards me. Their countenances were very furious &amp; bloody; they had their hair tied in a roll behind in which stuck two bones shaped, one like a broad arrow, the other a spear head; and the rest of our men coming from the vessel, asked me, what they should do? Whether they should get their guns to kill these two? But I persuaded them otherwise and desired them to be quiet, shewing their inabi|lity to defend us from what would follow, but to put our trust in the Lord, who is able to defend to the uttermost.</P>
<P>I then walked towards the place were our sick and lame were, (the two Indian men following me) and I told them the Indians were come and coming upon us; and whilst the two Indians stood with a wild furious countenance looking upon us, I thought within myself to give them some tobac|co and pipes, which they greedily snatch'd from me and making a snuffing noise like a wild beast, turned their backs on us and ran away.</P>
<P>We communed together, and considered our condition, being among a barbarous people, such as were generally accounted men-eaters, and be|lieved that these two were gone to alarm their peo|ple.
<PB N="7" REF="025393_0019_0FCD151DEA9AE7F8">
We sat ourselves down, expecting cruelty and hard death, except it should please the almighty God to work wonderfully for our deliverance. In this deep concernment some of us were not left with|out hopes; blessed be the name of the Lord in whom we trusted.</P>
<P>As we were under deep exercise and concernment a motion arose from one of us, that if we sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld put ourselves under the denomination of Spaniards (it being known that that nation had some influ|ence on them) and one of us, named Solomon Cresson speaking the Spanish language well, it was hop'd this might be a means for our delivery; to which most of the company assented.</P>
<P>Within two or three hours after the departure of the two Indians, some of our people being near the beach or strand, returned and said, The Indi|ans were coming in a very great number, all run|ning and shouting. About this time the storm was much abated, the rain ceased and the sun appeared which had been hid from us several days; and most of the Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans went to the vessel, casting forth whatever they could lay hold on, except Rum, Sugar, Molasses, Beef and Pork; but their <HI>Cassekey</HI> (for so they call their King) with about thirty more, came down to us in a furious manner, having a dismal aspect, and foaming at the mouth; their weapons were large Spanish knives, except their Cassekey's who had a bayonet that belonged to the master of our vessel; they rushed in upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and cried Nickaleer, Nickaleer?

us often, at last they cried Espania, or Spaniard? By which we understood them, that at the first they meant English; but they were answered to the lat|ter in Spanish, Yea; to which they replied, No, Espania, no; but all cry'd Nickaleer, Nickaleer: We sitting on our chests, boxes, and trunks, and some on the ground, the Indians surrounded us, but we stirred nor moved not, but sat all, or most of us, very calm and still, and some of us in a good frame of spirit, being freely given up to the Will of God.</P>
<P>Whilst we were thus sitting as a people almost unconcern'd, these bloody-minded creatures placed themselves behind each one, kicking and throwing away the bushes that were nigh, or under their feet &mdash;the Cassekey had placed himself behind me, standing on the chest which I sat upon, and they all had their arms extended, with their knives in their hands ready to execute their bloody design, some taking hold of us by the heads, with their knees set against our shoulders, and in this posture they seem'd to wait for the Cassekey to begin: They were high in words, which we understood not; but on a sudden, it pleased the Lord to work wonderfully for our preservation, and instantly all these savage-men were struck dumb, and like men amazed, for the space of a quarter of an hour; in which time their countenances fell, and they look|ed like another people. They then quitted their places they had taken behind us, and came in a|mongst us, requiring to have all our chests, trunks and boxes unlock'd, which being done, they divi|ded
<PB N="9" REF="025393_0021_0FCD15216EF5C250">
all that was in them. Our money the Casse|key took to himself, privately hiding it in the bushes; then they went to pulling off our clothes leaving each of us only a pair of breeches or an old coat, except my wife and child, Robert Barrow, and our master, from whom they took but little that day: Having thus done, they asked us again Nickaleer, Nickaleer? But we answered, by saying Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>We then began to enquire after St. Augustine, also we would talk of St. a Lucea, which was a town that lay about a degree to the northward; but they cunningly would seem to per|suade us, that they both lay to the southward; and we talked of the Havanna, that lay to the south|ward. These places they had heard of, and knew which way they lay.</P>
<P>At length the Cassekey told us how long it was to St. a Lucea, by days travel, but cared not to hear us mention St. Augustine. They would signify by signs, we should go to the Southward. We answered, that we must go to the Northward for Augustine. When they found they could not otherwise persuade us, they signi|fied, that we should go to the Southward for Ha|vanna, and that it was but a little way.</P>
<P>We gave them to understand, that we came that way, and were for the Northward; all which took place with them. We perceived that the Casse|key's heart was tendered towards us, for he kept mostly with us, and did the remaining part of that day keep off the petty robbers, which would have
<PB N="10" REF="025393_0022_0FCD152423DCFC08">
had our few rags from us. Some time before night we had a shower of rain, on which the Cas|sekey made signs for us to build some shelter; whereupon we got our tent up, and some leaves to lie upon</P>
<P>About this time our vessel lay dry on shore, and the Indians gathered themselves together, men and women, some hundreds in number, and having got all the goods out of her, and covered the bay for a large distance, they opened the stuffs and li|nen, and spread them to dry. They would touch no sort of strong drink, Sugar nor Molasses, but left it in the vessel. They shouted and made great noises in the time of plunder; but night coming on, the Cassekey put those chests and trunks which he had reserved for himself, into our tent; which pleased us, and gave us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expectation of his com|pany, for he was now become a defender of us from the rage of others. The Cassekey went down to the water-side amongst his people, and returned with three old coats that were wet and torn, which he gave us; one whereof I had. We made a fire at each end of our tent, and laid ourselves down, it being dark, but hearing hedious noises, and fearing that they were not satisfied, we expectnd them upon us. The chief Indian (or Cassekey) lay in our tent upon his chests; and about midnight we heard a company of Indians coming from the vessel towards us, making terrible shouts and coming fiercely up to the tent; but the Cas|sekey called to them, which caused them to stand. It seemed they had killed a Hog and brought him;
<PB N="11" REF="025393_0023_0FCD152564386E30">
&mdash;so the Cassekey asked us, if we would eat the Hog? Solomon Cresson by our desire, answered him, that we used not to eat at that time of the night; whereupon they threw the Hog down be|fore the tent, and the Cassekey sent them away.&mdash; They went shouting to the sea shore, where there were some hundreds of them revelling about our wreck.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="date">
<HEAD>The <HI>25</HI>th of the seventh month, being the sixth day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning, having purposed to endeavour for liberty to pass to the northward, Solomon o|pened the matter to the Cassekey, who answered, we must go to his town to the southward. This occasioned us to press him more urgently, to let us go for St. a Lucea, (this place having a Spanish name, we supposed to have found it under the go|vernment of that nation, from whence we might expect relief.) But the Cassekey told us, that it was about two or three days journey thither: and that when we came there, we should have our throats and scalps cut, and be shot, burnt and ea|ten. We thought that information was but to di|vert us, so that we were more earnest to go; but he sternly denied us, saying, we must go to his town.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock this morning the Cassekey came into our tent, and set himself amongst us, asking the old question, Nickaleer, Nickaleer? And directing his speech to one in particular, of us, he in simplicity, answered yes: which caused the Cassekey to ask the said person, if another,
<PB N="12" REF="025393_0024_0FCD1526DFD84478">
which he pointed to, was Nickaleer? He answer|ed, yes: then he said, Totus (or all) Nickaleer, and went from among us; but he returned in a short time, with some of his men with him, and afresh they went greedily to strip my wife and child, Robert Barrow, and our master, who had escaped till now.</P>
<P>Thus were we left almost naked, till the feud was somewhat abated, and then we got some things from them, which displeased some of them &mdash;and we then cut our tent in pieces, and got the most of our cloathing out of it, which the Indi|ans perceiving, took the remains from us: We men had most of us Breeches, and pieces of Can|vas; and the whole company interceded for my wife, that all might not be taken from her. About noon, the Indians having removed the plunder off the bay, and many of them gone, a guard was pro|vided, armed with bows and arrows, with whom we were summoned to march, and a burden pro|vided for every one to carry, that was any ways able. Our master, with his broken leg, was hel|ped along by his negro Ben, and my wife was for|ced to carry her child, they not suffering any of us to relieve her; for if any of us offered to lay down our burden, we were threatened to be shot. Thus were we forced along the beach barefooted.</P>
<P>We having saved one of the masters Quadrants, and seamen's calender, with two other books, as we walk'd along the bay, (the time suiting) our mate Richard Limpeny took an observation, and we found ourselves to be in the latitude of twenty
<PB N="13" REF="025393_0025_0FCD152993BF3CA0">
seven degrees and eight minutes: Some of the Indians were offended at it, and when he held up his Quadrant to observe, one of them drew an ar|row to shoot him; but it pleased GOD hitherto to prevent them from shedding any of our blood.</P>
<P>One passage I have omitted, <HI>viz.</HI> two of our mariners, named Thomas Fownes and Richard Limpeny, went forth this morning from our tent, down to the bay where the Indians were, and view|ing them at some distance, an Indian came running upon them, with his knife in his hand, and took hold of Thomas Fownes to stab him; but Tho|mas fell on his knees, using a Spanish ceremony, and begged him not to kill him; whereupon the Indian desisted, and bid him be gone to the place from whence he came; and the said Thomas, at his return, acquainted us how narrowly he had es|caped.</P>
<P>After we had travelled about five miles along the deep sand, the sun being extreme hot, we came to an inlet, on the other side whereof was the In|dian town, being little wigwams made of small poles stuck in the ground, which they bend one to another making an arch and covering them with thatch of small palmetto leaves; here we were commanded to sit down, and the Cassekey came to us, and with his hand scratched a hole in the sand, about a foot deep, and then came to wa|ter, which he made signs for us to come and drink of, and we being extremely thirsty, did, but the water was almost salt.</P>
<P>Whilst we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate here we saw great fires making
<PB N="14" REF="025393_0026_0FCD152AA8029D60">
on the other side of the inlet, which some of us thought were preparing for us; but after an hour's time being spent here, at length came an Indian with a small canoe from the other side, and I, with my wife and child, and Robert Barrow, were order|to to go into it, (the canoe was but just wide e|nough for us to sit down in) and over we were car|ried, and being landed, the man made signs for us to walk to the wigwams, which, we did; but the young Indians seemed to be frightened and fly from us. We were directed to a wigwam, which after|wards we understood to be the Cassekey's; it was about a man's height to the top, and herein was the Cassekey's wife&punc; and some old women sitting on a cabbin made of sticks about a foot high, covered with a mat, &amp; they made signs for us to sit down on the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, which we did. The Cassekey's wife ha|ving a young child sucking at her breast, gave it to another woman, and would have my child, which my wife was very loth to suffer, yet she would not be denied, but took our child and suckled it at her breast, viewing and feeling it from top to toe, and at length returned it to my wife.</P>
<P>By this time another parcel of our people were come over, and we sitting down by the wigwam side, an Indian brought a fish boiled, on a palmet|to lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and set it down amongst us, making signs&punc; for us to eat; but our exercise was too great for us to have any inclination to receive food: At length all our people were brought over, and afterward the Cassekey, who as soon as he came to the wig|wam, set hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf to work got some stakes, and stuck
<PB N="15" REF="025393_0027_0FCD152C1C8F2C28">
them in a row joining to his wigwam, and tied some sticks, whereon were small palmettoes tied and fastned them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> stakes about three feet high, and laid two or three mats, made of reeds down for shelter; which is seems he made for us, to break the wind off, and ordered us to lie down there; which we did as many as the mats would hold, and the rest lay on the ground by us. The Cassekey then went into his wigwam, and seated himself on his cabbin cross legged, having a bas|ket of palmetto berries brought him which he eat very greedily; after which came some Indians in to him, and talked much.</P>
<P>Night being come, and the moon being up, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Indian, who performed their ceremonies, stoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out looking full at the moon, making a hideous nois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and crying out acting like a mad man for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> space of half an hour, all the Indians being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> till he had done; after which they made a fear+ful noise, some like the barking of a dog, wolf, and other strange noise; after this one got a log an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> set himself down, holding the stick or log uprigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the ground, and several others got about him making a hideous noise, singing to our amazement &mdash;at length their women joined to the consort, and made the noise more terrible, which they continued till midnight, Towards morning there was great dews, and our fire being expended we were ex|tream cold.</P>

<P><PB N="16" REF="025393_0028_0FCD152EF855EFA0">This morning, the Cassekey looking on us with a mild aspect, sent his son with his striking staff to the inlet, to strike fish for us, which was perfor|med with great dexterity; for some of us walked down with him, and though we looked very ear|nestly when he threw his staff from him, we could not see a fish at the time he saw it, &amp; brought it to shore on the end of his staff Sometimes he would run swiftly pursuing a fish, and seldom mist when he darted at him, In two hours time he got as ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y fish as would serve twenty men.

<P>The Cassekey went this morning towards our vessel, but in his absence the other Indians looked very untowardly upon us, which created a jealousy of their cruelty yet to come.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we saw a great fire nigh the place of our vessel, and we concluded that our vessel and our boat were burnt where|upon we were almost confirmed, that they designed to destroy us; but about sun-setting the Cassekey came home, and we speaking to him he answered us, and seemed very affable, which we liked well. Night drawing on, and the wind shifting northward, we removed our shelter, and added the mats to it to break the wind off, which blowed cold, and laid ourselves on the sand. A|bout an hour within night came a parcel of Indi|ans
<PB N="17" REF="025393_0029_0FCD152FE3536178">
from the southward, being armed with bows and arrows, and coming near our tent, some of us espyed them, whereupon they squatted down:&mdash; This seemed a fresh motive of danger, and we a|wakened those of us who were fallen asleep, and bid them prepare, for things seeming dangerous, we supposing they were come to forward our de|str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, or to carry us to the southward; they sat thus a considerable time, but at length they distributed themselves to the wigwams.

<P>Some time before night, Robert Barrow was ex|horting us to be patient, and in a godly manner he expounded that text of scripture,
<Q>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, &amp;c. <BIBL>Rev. iii.10.</BIBL></Q>
After which, he ended with a most fervent prayer, desiring of the Lord, that whereas he had suffered us to be cast amongst a barbarous and heathenish people, if that it was his blessed will, he would preserve and deliver us from amongst them, that our names might not be buried in ob|livion, and that he might lay his body amongst faithful friends: And at the close of his prayer he seemed to have an assurance, that his petition would be granted; in all which, some of us were livingly refreshed and strengthened.</P>

Hereupon he took three negro men (one of Joseph Kirle's, and two of mine) and with a canoe went up the sound.</P>
<P>This day the Indians were busy with what they had taken out of our vessel, and would have im|ployed all of us to do, some one thing, some ano|ther for them; but we not knowing the conse|quence, endeavored to shun it, and would deny their demands: But some of our men answered their desires in making and sewing some cloth to|gether, stringing our beds, mending the locks of the chests, &amp;c. Whatever they thought was amiss they would be putting upon us to mend, till we wholly refused; at which time I heard a saying that came from one of the chief Indians, thus, [English Son of a Bitch] which words start|led me; for I did believe they had some of our na|tion in their possession, of whom they had heard such an expression: I passed away from the Wig|wam with much trouble.</P>
<P>This day, being the first of the week, and we ha|ving a large bible, and a book of Robert Barclay's some one or other was often reading in them; but being most of us sat together, Robert Barrow desi|red our people to wait upon the Lord; in which time Robert had a word in season to us, and after|wards went to prayer, the Indians standing about us, when some of the younger sort would be mock|ing,
<PB N="19" REF="025393_0031_0FCD1533D2B1D7C8">
but not to our disturbance; the elder sort stood very modestly the whole time: After prayer was ended, they all withdrew quietly; but some of them (especially the Cassekey's eldest son) would take great delight in our reading, and would take the bible or the other book, and give it to one or the other of us to read; the sound of which plea|sed them, for they would sit quietly and very at|tentively to hear us.</P>
<P>The Cassekey having been gone the most part of the day, with three negroes in our boat, he at last came over the bar into the inlet, and we rejoi|ced to see our boat again, for we thought she had been burnt. Our negroes told us, they went up the sound with the Cassekey, and landed near the place where our tent had been: His chief business was to remove the money from one place to ano|ther, and bury it, This old man would trust our people but not his own&punc; After that was done they went to the place where our vessel was burnt: they launched our boat in which the old Cassekey put his chests, wherein was our linen and other of our trade. Also they got a small rundlet which they filled with wine out of a quarter cask that was left, and brought sugar out of the wreck which was not consumed by the fire. By this time came up the Cas|sekey and he told us, on the morrow we should go with our boat; which was cheerful news to us: And some Indians having been out and brought home some oysters, the Cassekey gave us some, bidding us take what we had a mind to. A little before night, the Cassekey opened his chests and

<P>This morning we waited an opportunity to get leave to depart which was granted us: Whereupon we asked for such things as they did not make use of, viz. a great glass wherein was five or six pounds of butter, some sugar, the rundlet of wine, and some balls of chocolate; all which was granted us also a bowl to heave water out of the boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but the Cassekey would have a negro boy of mine, na|med Caesar, to which I could not tell what to say, but he was resolved on it. We got down to the water side and set all our people over that were to travel; and Joseph Kirle, Robert Barrow, I, my Wife and child, with two of our mariners, went in the boat, and rowed along shore northwards, but the Cassekey would have had us to have gone with our boat up the sound: We supposed the sound was a great river, and therefore were not willing to take his advice, having no knowledge; but his counsel was good as we found afterwards, for the conveniency of passage.</P>
<P>The Cassekey and some other Indians went with our people towards our wreck, we rowing along shore and our boat very leaky, so that one person had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mploy enough to heave out the water.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="025393_0033_0FCD1536C07FA7B0">Just before we left the Indian town, several In|dians were for taking the little clothes and rags we had got; but we calling out to the Cassekey he would cause them to let us alone.</P>

<P>It was nigh noon when we left our wreck (she being burn'd down to her floor timbers which lay in the sand) and set forward, some in the boat, the rest travelling on shore; and a little before sunset our people came up with abundance of small fish that had been forced on shore as we may suppose, by the storm that we had met with, (they lying far from the water, being much tainted) covering the shore for nigh a mile in length, of which our peo|ple gathered as many as they could carry: About sunset we put on shore to refresh ourselves, and take a small respite; also to take my kinsman Ben|jamin Allen into the boat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or this afternoon in his travel, he was taken with a fever and ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and we had much trouble to get him along, he having been sick nigh unto death (being fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st taken the day before we left Blewfields road) till about a week before we were cast away.</P>

<P>Having a large fire, many of us got under the lee of it, and others buried themselves in the sand, in hopes to get a little sleep, that we might be some|what refreshed, and thereby be the better enabled, some to travel and some to row, the remaining part of the night; but the sand-flies and musket|toes were so extreme thick, it was impossible: the moon shining, we launched our boat, and I, my wife and child, the master, Robert Barrow, my kinsman Allen, Solomon Cresson, Joseph Buckley and the master's negro, went in her, the rest tra|velling along shore: About midnight, or a little after, our people came by an Indian town, and the Indians came out in great numbers, but offered no violence, more than endeavoring to take from them what little they had; but they ma|king some small resistance, the Indians were put by their purpose: They were very desi|rous to have us come on shore, and would hale us, but our people would have us keep off: We were got among a parcel of breakers, and so had much ado to get out to sea.</P>

<P>This day about noon, Joseph Kirle having his quadrant and calender, took an observation, being in the latitude of 27 deg. 45 min.

<P>The two Indians who followed us, were for tak|ing off our clothes (which would not cover our bodies) but we not being willing to yield, they would snatch a piece from one, and a bit from a|nother, and run away with that, and then come a|gain and do the like. These two Indians took a|way what was given my wife and child, which we knew not how to help, but we exercised patience&middot;</P>
<P>We enquired how far it was to St a Lucea, (one of them speaking a little Spanish) and by signs we understood it was not far. They then made signs, that when we came there we should be put to the most cruel death, but we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> otherwise.</P>

two or three houses which look'd white, as though they were plaistered with lime, which put us in hopes that there were Spaniards there; so we set forwards, as the Indians directed, for St. a Lucea, and they made signs that we should come to an inlet of the sea, and on the other side was St. a Lu|cea. We travelled about four miles, and came to the inlet, but saw no settlement on the other side, so we concluded to lie there all night. We saw the track of a large bear, and other wild beasts, whereupon we set to work to get wood, and then a fire. Abundance of muskettoes and sand flies hindered our rest; to remedy which, we digged holes in the sand, got some grass, and laid it there|in to lie upon, in order to cover ourselves from the flies, which most of us did; but it being extreme cold, and firing scarce, we had little comfort.</P>
<P>About midnight we sent our people to see if they could get off our boat and bring it into the inlet, that we might get over to the other side: They went and launched her, but the sea was so rough, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there was no possibility of getting her off, for she was soon filled and put to swim, and they, boat and all were driven on shore again.</P>
<P>Whilst our people were gone for our boat, we espied some Indians in a canoe, with their torch, a fishing; we sent for Solomon, (who was gone to launch the boat) expecting they would come see|ing fires, and we should not tell what to say to them, but they did not.

<HEAD>The <HI>30</HI>th of the seventh month, being the fourth day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning, by break of day, we saw a small canoe from the other side put off shore, with two Indians in her, going up the river (or sound) a fish|ing: We hailed them in Spanish, and as soon as they heard and saw us, they made to the shore with all speed, and away to their town they run. We perceiving they were shy of us, began to doubt of their amity, which we had so much depended on, whereupon we counselled our people how to deport themselves, especially our negroes. About sun-rising we saw the Indians coming, running in a very great number, with their bows and arrows, to the inlet, where having five or six canoes, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> got into them, as many as those canoes could ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; and others took to the water, and swam over to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ey came in the greatest rage that possib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a barbarous people could. Solomon began to spea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Spanish to them but they answered not till they came on shore, some distance from us, and then coming running upon us, they cried out Nickaleer Nickaleer? We all sat still, expecting death, and that in a most barbarous manner, for they that did speak unto them could not be heard; but they rushed violently on us, rending and tearing those few clothes we had; they that had breeches, had so many about them, that they hardly touched the ground till they were shaken out of them; they tore all from my wife, and espying her hair lace, some were going to cut the hair away to get it, but like greedy dogs another snatch'd and tore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off.
<PB N="28" REF="025393_0040_0FCD15429EA853E0">
As for our poor young child, they snatch'd from it what little it had as though they would have shaken and torn it limb from limb.</P>
<P>After they had taken all from us but our lives, they began to talk one to another, vehemently foa|ming at the mouth, like wild boars, and taking their bows and arrows, with other weapons, cried out Nickaleer, Nickaleer? Solomon spoke in Spa|nish to them and said, We are Spaniards; but they would not hear him, and continued crying out Nickaleer, Nickaleer? Withal drawing their ar|rows to the head; but suddenly we perceived them to look about and listen, and then they desisted from prosecuting their bloody design, and one of them took a pair of breeches and gave them to my wife. We brought our great bible and a large book of Robert Barclay's to this place; and being all stript as naked as we were born, and end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avoring to hide our nakedness these Cannibals took the books, and tearing out the leaves, would give each of us a leaf to cover us, which we took from them at which time they would deride and smite us, and instantly another of them would snatch away what the other gave us, smiting and deriding us withal.</P>
<P>Robert Barrow, with myself, Wife and child, were ordered to go into a canoe, to be carried to the other side of the inlet, being a furlong over, four Indians being in the canoe to paddle; when we came to the other side within a canoe's length or two of the shore, a number of Indians with their bows and arrows, came running into the water,
<PB N="29" REF="025393_0041_0FCD1544DFD1E3A8">
some to their knees, some deeper, having their bows and arrows drawn up, crying out, Nickaleer, Nickaleer? which they continued without ceasing. The Indians that brought us over leap'd out of the canoe, and swam ashore, fearing they should be shot; but in this juncture, it pleased GOD to tender the hearts of some of them towards us, es|pecially the Cassekey's wife, and some of the chief|est amongst them who were made instruments to intercede for us, and stop the rage of the multitude who seem'd not to be satisfied without our blood. The Cassekey then order'd some to swim and fetch the canoe ashore; which being done, his wife came in a compassionate manner and took my wife out of the canoe, ordering her to follow her, which she did some distance from the inlet side, and stood till all our people were brought over, which in a little time was done: But the rage of some was still great, thirsting to shed our blood, and a migh|ty strife there was amongst them; some would kill us; others would prevent it; and thus one In|dian was striving with another.</P>
<P>All being got over, we were to walk along the sea-shore to their town, and in this passage we most of us felt the rage of some of them, either by striking or stoning, and divers arrows were shot; but those that were for preserving us, would watch those that were for destroying, and when some of them would go to shoot, others of them would catch hold of their bows or arm. It was so or|der'd that none of us was touch'd with their ar|rows, but several of us were knock'd down, and
<PB N="30" REF="025393_0042_0FCD15465CF42BA0">
some tumbled into the sea; we dared not to help one another, but help we had by some of them, be|ing made instrumental to succour us. My wife received several blows, and an Indian came and took hold of her hair and was going either to cut her throat, or something like it, having his knife nigh her throat, but I looked at him, making a sign that he should not, so he desisted; at which time another Indian came, with a handful of sea-sand, and filled our poor child's mouth.</P>
<P>By this time the Cassekey's wife came to my wife seeing her oppressed, and pulled the sand out of our child's mouth, and kept by my wife till we got to the Cassekey's house, which was about forty feet long, and twenty five feet wide, covered with Palmetto leaves, both top and sides. There was a range of cabins, or a Barbecue, on one side and two ends; at the entering on one side of the house a passage was made of benches on each side, leading to the cabbins; on these benches sat the chief Indians, and at the upper end of the cabbin was the Cassekey seated. A kind of debate was held amongst them for an hours time; after which Solomon and some others were called to the Cassekey, and were seated on the cab|bin, where the Cassekey talked to Solomon in the Spanish language, but could not hold a discourse. In a little time some raw deer-skins were brought in, and given to my wife and negro woman; and to us men such as the Indians wear, being a piece of plaitwork of straws, wrought of divers colors, and of a triangular figure with a belt of 4 fingers broad
<PB N="31" REF="025393_0043_0FCD1548A352ADC8">
of the same wrought together, which goeth about the waist and the angle of the other having a thing to it coming between the legs, and strings to the end of the belt, all three meeting together, are fastened behind with a horse tail, or a bunch of silk-grass, exactly resembling it, of a flaxen color; this being all the apparel or covering that the men wear, and thus they clothed us,</P>
<P>A place was appointed for us on the floor of the house, where we were ordered to lie down, but the place was extream nasty; for all the stones of the berries which they eat, and all the nastiness that was made amongst them, lay on their floor, so that the place swarmed with abundance of ma|ny sorts of creeping things, as a large black hairy spider, which hath two claws like a crab, scorpions, and a numberless number of small buggs. On these matts we lay, with these vermin crawling o|ver our naked bodies; to brush them off, was like driving muskettes off from one, where they are ex|tream thick.</P>
<P>The Indians were seated as aforesaid, the Casse|key at the upper end of them, and the range of cab|bins was filled with men, women, and children, be|holding us: At length we heard a woman or two cry, according to their manner, and that very sor|rowfully; one of which I took to be the Casse|key's wife, which occasioned some of us to think, that something extraordinary was to be done to us &mdash;we also heard a strange sort of a noise, which was not like the noise made by a man, but we could not understand what, nor where it was, for
<PB N="32" REF="025393_0044_0FCD154A2DB128A8">
sometimes it sounded to be in one part of the house, sometimes in another, to which we had an ear: and indeed our ears and eyes could perceive or hear nothing but what was strange and dismal, and death seemed to surround us; but time discovered this noise to us: The occasion of it was thus:</P>
<P>In one part of this house, where the fire was kept, was an Indian man, having- a pot on the fire, wherein he was making a drink of the leaves of a shrub, (which we under|stood by the Spaniards, called casseena) boiling the said leaves after they had parched them in a pot; then with a grourd, having a long neck, and at the top of it a small hole, which the top of ones finger could cover, and at the side of it a round hole of two inches diameter; they take the liquor out of the pot, and put it into a deep round bowl, which being almost filled, containeth nigh three gallons; with this gourd they brew the liquor, and make it froth very much; it looketh of a deep brown color. In the brewing this liquor was this noise made, which we thought strange; for the pressing of the gourd gently down into the liquor, and the air which it contained, being forced out of the little hole at the top, occasioned a sound, and according to the time and motion given, would be various. This drink when made and cool to sup, was in a shell first carried to the Cas|sekey, who threw part of it on the ground, and the rest he drank up, and then would make a loud hem; and afterwards the cup passed to the rest of the Cassekey's associates, as aforesaid; but no o|ther
<PB N="33" REF="025393_0045_0FCD154BE099A848">
man, woman, or child must touch or taste of this sort of drink; of which they sat sipping, chatting, and smoking tobacco, or some other herb instead thereof, for the most part of the day.</P>
<P>About noon some fish were brought to us on small palmetto leaves, being boiled with scales, head ands gills, and nothing taken from them but the gutts; but our troubles and exercises were such that we cared not for food.</P>
<P>In the evening, we being laid on the place a|foresaid, the Indians made a drum of a skin, co|vering therewith the deep bowl in which they brewed their drink, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating thereon with a stick, and having a couple of rattles made of a small gourd, put on a stick with small stones in it, shak|ing it; they began to set up a most hideous howl|ing, very irksome to us, and some time after came many of their young women, some singing some dancing: This was continued till midnight, after whih they went to sleep.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>1</HI>st of the eighth month, called October, being the fifth day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This day the Cassekey, looking on us pleasantly made presents to some of us, especially to my wife &mdash;he gave her a parcel of shell fish, which are known by the name of clamms, one or two he roasten, and gave her shewing that she must serve the rest so, and eat them.

from the time of its Birth, until we were cast away, began now to be cheerful, and have an appetite to food; it had no covering but a small piece of raw deer-skin, not a shred of linen or woolen to put on it.</P>
<P>About the tenth hour we observed the Indians to be on a sudden motion, and most of the prin|cipal of them betook themselves to their houses: the Cassekey went to dressing his head, and paint|ing himself, and so did all the rest: When they had done, they came to the Cassekey's house, and seated themselves in order. In a small time after came an Indian with some small attendance into the house, making a ceremonious motion, and seated himself by the Cassekey, and the persons that came with him seated themselves amongst the others: After some small pause, the Cassekey be|gan a discourse which held him nigh an hour, af|ter which the strange Indian and his companions went forth to the water-side to their canoe lying in the sound, and returned presently with such presents, as they had brought, delivering them to the Cassekey, and those sitting by giving an ap|plause, the presents were some few bunches of the herb they made their drink of, and another herb which they use instead of tobacco, and some pla|ted balls stuffed with moss, to lay their heads on instead of pillows: The ceremony being ended, they all seated themselves again, and went to drinking Casseena, smoaking and talking during the strangers stay.</P>
<P>About noon some fish were brought to us&punc; and
<PB N="35" REF="025393_0047_0FCD15501D64E318">
our hunger was grown stronger upon us, but the quantity given was not much more than each a mouthful, which we eat; the Cassekey ordered the master Joseph Kirle, Solomon Cresson, my wife and me, to sit upon their cabbin to eat our fish, and they gave us some of their berries to eat &mdash;we tasted them, but not one amonst us could suffer them to stay in our mouths, for we could compare the taste of them to nothing else but rot|ten cheese steeped in tobacco juice. Some time after we had eaten, the Indians asked us, if we were Spaniards? Solomon answered them yes.&mdash; Then some of them would point to those whose hair was black, or of a deep brown, and say such a one was a Spaniard of the Havanna, and such of Augustine: but those whose hair was of a light colour, they were doubtful of; some would say they were no Spaniards.</P>
<P>About the third hour in the afternoon the stran|gers went away, and some small time after, they having satisfied themselves that most of us were Spaniards, told us, that we should be sent for to the next town; and also said, that there was a Nickaleer off, which we understood (Englishmen of Bristol) to the number of six men and a woman, and that they were to be put to death before we should get thither. We were silent, although much concerned to hear that report; they also told us, that a messenger would come for us, to direct us to the next town, and from thence to Augusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

the singing and dancing was ended, came in a stranger armed with bow and arrows; the Cas|sekey and his companions entertained him with half an hours discourse, which being ended, we were on a sudden ordered to get up, and hurried away with this stranger, they not giving us time to see if we were altogether: and a troop of young Indian men and boys followed us for about four miles; all which way they pelted us with stones: At length they all left us, except two and our guide; but we missed Solomon Cresson and Jo|seph Kirle's boy, and negro Ben, which was no small trouble to us.</P>
<P>We had not travelled above five miles, before our guide caused us to stop, and at some small distance there was an Indian town, which I sup|posed our guide belonged to, for Indians came from thence with fire and water for him, and with Palmetto leaves they made a blast of fire; here we staid nigh two hours: The flies were very thick, and the night very cold, so that our naked bodies were not able to endure it, but with grief. At length we left this place, but the whole night following we were troubled with two young In|dians, who at times would be abusing one or other of us, singling them out, and asking if they were not Nickaleer, or English? If they said nay, then they would hit them a blow or more with a trun|cheon which they had, and said, <HI>they were.</HI> We travelled all night without stopping, from the a|foresaid place.</P>

<P><PB N="37" REF="025393_0049_0FCD155567154790">After sun-rising we came up with the wreck of the vessel that we heard was cast away, and she was staved all to pieces, for her keelson was dri|ven on shore. We saw Sugar hogsheads, Ginger, and Logwood, which gave us to suppose that it was one of our fleet, and we thought it to be either Burrough's or Smith's, belonging to Bristol. A mile or more from hence we came to an inlet, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> guide told us we must swim over, except my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Robert Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">row; but we signified that we could not: He then carried Robert Barrow, Joseph Kirle, me, my wife and child over first, and at length the whole company, for it was a great way over.

We got under a grape bush for shelter from the sun, and I sent one of my negroes to seek for water for them, but there was none to be had; he got some sea grapes, which with resting, refreshed the weak and lame.</P>
<P>Our guide was for forcing us forward, so we travelled about four or five miles further, and met with the Cassekey of the town, who was comman|der of the northern part of this coast: He was an ancient man his beard and hair grey, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|quired for the Captain; so our people pointed to Joseph Kirle, whom he went to, and embraced him; then he asked for our mate or pilot. This man could speak Spanish better than any we had met with yet, but not so well as to discourse, only
<PB N="38" REF="025393_0050_0FCD1556DE3EDBE0">
to ask some questions, and we had three or four amongst us could make a shift to answer him, for Solomon was kept behind. This old Cassekey seemed to have compassion on us, and said, that those people who had served us thus, in stripping of us, were rogues; but we were his comrades or friends. Withal he said, in a few days, he would carry us to Augustine; and thereupon he told us of six Englishmen and one woman being at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> town. We enquired if he intended them for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gustine? He shook his head, and pointed to the southward, saying, Nickaleer no Camerade, (En|glishmen were not his friends) which words were unpleasant to us.</P>
<P>These people kept us company till we c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e within a mile or two of their town, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> left us, and going faster got in before us. Their town stood about half a mile from the sea-shore, within the land on the sound, being surrounded with a swamp, in which grew white Mangrove trees, which hid the town from the sea. We were directed to the Cassekey's house, which was large and filled with Indians, and then ordered to sit down. The old Cassekey fetched some water, and washed Robert Barrow's feet and my wife's &mdash;after which he got some canvas and crocus gin|ger bags, which they had got out of the vessel that was cast on shore, which were distributed a|mongst us; Joseph Kirle had a coat given him, which they had taken from the people of the other vessel, but it was rent down the back; my wife had two pieces of sail canvas given her, and I&punc;
<PB N="39" REF="025393_0051_0FCCDD8492DA9190">
with others, had a crocus ginger bag; they also gave a piece of an old linen shirt, in bigness of a small handkerchief, to cover our child; and these were all our cloathing. Robert Barrow and my wife were quite spent with travelling barefoot on the hot sand, having bruised her feet against stumps stones and prickles: especially Robert Barrow, whose feet had holes in them, that one might have put the top of one's thumb in; but we were di|rected to lie down on a cabbin.</P>
<P>The other vessel's company that was cast away, were John Smith, master of the Nantwich, a barque belonging to Bristol, which came out of Jamaica with us, with five men and one woman, viz. Andrew Murray merchant, Andrew Barnes, mate, Hugh Allen, John Osler, John Shears and Cornelius Toker, two boys, with a woman passen|ger named Penelope. We took an opportunity to discourse with them, and they told us, they were cast away the same night we were, and their vessel being forced by the storm (they not being able for two days before to carry any sail) on shore, they got into their boat, and so on shore, and in a small time was a great part of their wreck driven on shore, amongst which was a barrel or more of water, some barrels of beef or pork, with their chests, and many other things which they got.</P>
<P>On the morrow following, they designed to have travelled to the northward; and Andrew Barnes their mate having been a long time afflict|ed with a flux, which had wasted his body to skin and bone, so that he was not able to help himself,
<PB N="40" REF="025393_0052_0FCD155AAA682BB0">
they left behind, and travelled a mile or more, when they came to an inlet which they could not pass &mdash;whereupon then returned back again to take their boat, but at their return, before they could get away with their boat, they espied the Indians coming on them, who soon got to them, and asked in Spanish, what nation they were? If Spaniards, English, or French? And the Indians made signs to give them their clothing, which they readily did. But still they enquired, of what nation? At first, they answered Spaniards; but the na|tives looked so furiously: that they soon answered them Englishmen: thereupon every one had it Nickaleer, Nickaleer? And then they very eager|ly stripped them of all they had on them; after which, they drove them away to the northward to their own town; but Andrew Barnes, not being able to stand or go, was left behind, after they had stripped him on the land naked, when they were driven away.</P>
<P>Before they got to the town, the Indian Casse|key gave them some clothing, and no violence was offered to their persons, and they had plenty of fish and berries to the time of our coming:&mdash; John Smith and Andrew Murray had their lodg|ing in the Cassekey's house, and the woman named Penelope; the rest of Smith's people lodged in other Indian houses: On our coming, the old Cassekey told them, they must turn out, and make room for the Spaniards; but Smith and Murray would not go, and the Indians did not force them.</P>
<P>In some time after we had been in the house,
<PB N="41" REF="025393_0053_0FCD155C1E520A08">
came in Indian women, loaded with basket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of berries, mostly of the palm, some sea-side coco plums, and sea-side grapes: O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the two latter we would eat, but of the palm berries we could not bear the taste in our mouths: We then laid our|selves on the cabbin, on that part which was ap|pointed us, and on the other part the young Casse|key lay, being parted by a chest that stood there|on. Before night there was a parcel of large fish, called drumms, brought in, and the old Cassekey told Joseph Kirle, that those were for the Spani|ards, and bid him let somebody dress them, he also ordered us a pot. They were soon dressed and we eat them; and night being come, the old Cassekey enquired after our losses: which we, as well as we could, gave him to understand, that in our vessel was a great deal of cloathing and mo|ney, which the Indians at Hoe bay had taken from us. He understood so much of the matter, that he grew covetous, and said, he would go and get some of it from them.</P>
<P>About midnight came Solomon Cresson in a canoe with two Indians: The old Cassekey began to examine him concerning our vessel, goods and money, or plate; of which Solomon rendered a fuller account to him than we could; which caus|ed him to resolve on the morrow to provide men and boats, and to go down the sound to Hoe-bay, to have part from them. He would have had So|lomon to have gone with him but Solomon refused.</P>
<P>We enquired of Solomon concerning his stay, &amp; of the negro Ben, and Joseph Kirle's boy: He
<PB N="42" REF="025393_0054_0FCD155E65128250">
said, that he was stayed by force, but the negro &amp; the boy were asleep in another house, when we were driven away. They had a design in staying of Solomon, which he could not rightly understand, but supposed that they doubted that we were all Span|iards; for the Indians of St. a Lucea would say to Solomon, that he was a Spaniard, and some others, but the most of us were not Spaniards, and that we had stolen Solomon; but Solomon denied it.</P>

Several Indians betook themselves to their boats, and carried what they had to some high land a considerable distance, where a place was made for their Cassekey, or King; but before day the house we were in was afloat, and the Indians were for turning us out, bidding us to take an old canoe that had a hole in the side of her, almost at the bottom, big enough for a man to put his hand through, so that she was full of water? in this ca|noe they would have had us shifted for ourselves, but we were not willing to go; the Indians made signs for us to be gone divers times, and at length they grew angry, and took my kinsman Allen in|to the canoe and carried him away; in a little time after they returned with the canoe, and bid me and Robert Barrow be gone. By this time day appeared, but the wind and rain con|tinued still violent. I then saw an house on ano|ther oyster hill, that the water was not got over yet, to which I went, and asked, by signs, If I might be there?

<P><PB N="46" REF="025393_0058_0FCD15648B1ABA48">This morning early came a messenger, giving an account, that the old Cassekey was within some few leagues of the town, and that we might expect him this forenoon: Within that time he came in sight, and we all drew down to the water side to receive him; we perceived he came in state, ha|ving his two canoes lash'd together, with poles a|thwart from the one to the other, making a plat|form, which being covered with a mat, on it stood a chest, which was belonging to us, and my Negro boy Caesar (which the Cassekey of Hoe-bay took from me) whom he had got from the Indians; upon this chest he sat cross legged, being newly painted red, and his men with poles, setting the canoes along to the shore: On seeing us he cried [<HI>Wough</HI>] and look'd very sternly at us.</P>
<P>He was receiv'd by his people with great ho|mage, holding out his hands (as their custom is) to be kissed, having his chest carried before him to his house, whither he went, and the house was filled with Indians. The old Cassekey began and held a discourse for some hours, giving an account, as we suppose, what he heard and saw; in which discourse he would often mention Nickaleer; which caused us to fear that all things were not well. After he had told his story, and some of the elder Indians had exprest their sentiments thereof, they drank Casseena, and smoaked till evening: The house then being clear, the old Cassekey looked very un|pleasantly, shewing to us several things which he had got, as a hatchet, a knife, the chest, and many other things; asking us, If they were not ours?
<PB N="47" REF="025393_0059_0FCD1565E22F30B0">
Which we owned: Whereupon he would say, they were Nickaleer (or English) We signified, that we had them of the English, but our money was Spa|nish.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening, Joseph Kirle, myself and Solomon, got an opportunity to discourse with him &mdash;we began to urge his promise of carrying us for Augustine. At first he started his hardships and labour to Hoe-bay and back, and that he must have time to rest before he could go out again; then he told us, the way was long, and would be tedious, and that at several places we must draw the canoes over land for a great distance; he also mentioned how many towns there were between this and Au|gustine, in number ten. But nigh the conclusion he setting an angry countenance upon us, told us, that at Hoe-bay he was informed, that we should say, we were all Englishmen: After he had said this in an angry manner, he turn'd from us and went away.</P>
<P>This laid all our hopes in the dust, and we soon perceived the Indians grew jealous, of us, for they would now be daily asking us, if we were not Nic|kaleer, or English? And would not seem satisfied with a denial. Many days were spent, and the time drew nigh, that we understood the old Cassekey was intended for Augustine; hereupon we applied ourselves to him, requesting that if all might not go, he would carry some of us; but he told us, He would carry but one. This put us on querying which of us should be that one? The generality was for me; but I and Joseph Kirle were for So|lomon,
<PB N="48" REF="025393_0060_0FCD1567DBD47360">
because he could speak the Spanish language well and no other of us could: And should any o|ther of us have gone and come amongst those In|dians to the northward, who, we supposed, could speak the Spanish language well, we should be dis|covered to be what those people supposed we were therefore it might overthrow all our expectations.; but Solomon might pass all those objections.&mdash; These reasons did not satisfy our people, so that some of them grew choleric; of which the old Cassekey took notice, and told Solomon, that if they made such a stir, he would not carry one; if he did it should be either Solomon, Joseph Kirle, or me. Whereupon we prevailed with him that Solomon mightgo, and accordingly made preparations: The Cassekey appointed the number of Indians to go with him; also a cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was sent for, which when it came, we found it to have belonged to the English by the make of her. This cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had a great hole in the head nigh the bottom, with many great rents and holes in her, but Joseph Kirle and I were re|quired to mend her, which with much ado we ac|complished, the canoe, being much decay'd and rotten where the rents were.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>18</HI>th day of the eighth month, being the first day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning the old Cassekey, with Solomon and six Indians in a canoe, set out for Augustine; the Cassekey carried a small chest, in which was nigh one hundred pieces of eight, as some of our people supposed, with some other things that were
<PB N="49" REF="025393_0061_0FCD1569AA84C400">
got from our vessel. The weather was likely for rain, which caused us to fear, should the weather prove bad, that Solomon would hardly live to get to Augustine, for he had nothing to cover him, ex|cept a pair of Indian breeches, and a small piece of skin that covered his breast.</P>
<P>We understood by the old Cassekey, that it would be a month or next new moon, before we could expect their return; All which time we spent in much trouble and hardship. The wea|ther began to grow cold, and provisions very short that is palm berries, coco, plumbs and sea grapes, (which are the three sorts before expressed) the time of these fruits bearing being over, they having no sort of fruit till the next Spring.</P>
<P>These people neither sow nor plant any manner of thing whatsoever, nor care for any thing but what the barren sands produce: Fish they have as plenty as they please, but sometimes they would make it scarce to us, so that a meal in a week was most commonly our portion, and three meals a rarity.</P>
<P>After the old Cassekey's departure our hardships increased, especially my wife and child's, for want of food of any sort; my wife's milk was gone, and our poor child was in great want; the Indians now and then would give it suck, but scarcely to satisfy it, for there was a woman or two of their own which had young children, and no breast to suckle them. Our extremity was such, that any manner of thing would go down with us, the gills and guts of a fish picked off a

dunghill was acceptable, the scraps the Indians threw a way, and the water they boiled their fish in, we were thankful for, though never so inde|cently handled by them. And though my wife had hardly any milk for our child yet an Indian woman, who was lately delivered of a child, and had no milk in her breast, would have had her suc|kled her child which my wife consented to; and this was a means of her and our child's reaping a benefit, for the Indians would give her fish, which means helped to increase milk for our child.</P>
<P>Many were our exercises, both in body and mind, among this people. Sometimes they would look upon us as though they had some ill in|tent towards the whole of us; at other times they would tell us (who were nominally Spaniards) how and in what manner those of Smith's compa|ny should be put to death. And thus were we daily exercised in sorrow and grievous troubles.&mdash; Sometimes doubts would arise among ourselves, concerning what would be the end of us, and what manner of deaths we should pass through; and whomsoever these doubts did appear in, it would be hard for another to help with counsel: But some there were whose hopes never failed, they trusting in the Lord to work for our de|liverance. One thing did seem more grievous to me and my wife, than any other thing; which was, that if it so happen'd that we should be put to death, we feared that our child would be kept a|live, and bred up as one of those people: When these thoughts did arise, it wounded us deep.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="025393_0063_0FCD156E83F3AC48">It now being the time of the moon's entring the first quarter, the Indians had a ceremonious dance, which they began about eight o'clock in the morning: In the first place came in an old man, and took a staff about eight feet long, hav|ing a broad arrow on the head thereof, and thence half way painted red and white, like unto a bar|ber's pole; in the middle of this staff was fixed a piece of wood shaped like unto a thigh, leg and foot of a man, and the lower part thereof was painted black: And this staff being carried out of the Cassekey's house, was set fast in the ground, standing upright: This being done, he also bro'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out a basket, containing six rattles, which were ta|ken out thereof, and placed at the foot of the staf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &mdash;then another old man came in, and set up an howling like unto a mighty dog, but beyond him for length of breath, withal making a proclama|tion; This being done and most of them having painted themselves, some red, some black, some with black and red, with their bellies girt up as tite as well they could girt themselves with ropes, ha|ving their sheath of arrows at their backs, and their bows in their hands, being gathered together about the staff, six of the chiefest men in esteem amongst them, especially one who is their Doc|tor, and much esteemed, took up the rattles, and began an hideous noise, standing round the staff with their rattles and bowing without ceasing to the staff for about half an hour; whilst these six were thus employed, all the rest were staring and scratching, pointing upwards and downwards,
<PB N="52" REF="025393_0064_0FCD156FA5DE88C8">
on this and the other side, every way, looking like men frighted, or more like furies: Thus they be|haved themselves till the six had done shaking their rattles. Then they all began a dance vio|lently stamping on the ground for the space of an hour or more, without ceasing; in which time they sweat in a most excessive manner, so that by the time the dance was over, what by their sweat and the violent stamping of their feet, the ground was trodden into furrows, and by the morning, the place where they danced was covered with mag|gots: Thus often repeating the manner, they con|tinued till about three or four o'clock in the after|noon, by which time many were sick and faint: And then, they gathered into the Cassekey's house, they sat down, having some hot Casseena ready, which they drank plentifully of, and gave great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r quantities thereof to the sick and fainty than to others: Then they eat berries. On these days they eat not any food till night.</P>
<P>The next day about the same time, they began their dance as the day before; also the third day they began their dance at the usual time; At which time came many Indians from other towns, and fell to dancing, without taking any notice one of the other.</P>
<P>This third day they were stricter than the other two days, for no woman must look upon them; but if any of their women went out of their houses they went veiled with a mat.</P>

<P>About this time, John Smith and Andrew Mur|ray were sharply seized with a fever and ague; when the fit of the ague was on them, the Indians would mock and deride them: This we well ob|served, that these people had no compassion on their aged declining people, when they were past their labour, nor on others of their own, which lay under any declining condition; for the younger is served before the elder, and the elder people, both men and women, are slaves to the younger.</P>

<P>This morning about the sun rising came two strange Indians, who had run so hard that they sweated extreamly, of whom we under|stood that the Spaniards were coming with their old Cassekey&punc; which news surprised us, doubting the truth of it, for Solomon had been gone but 16 days and we understood that they must have an extra|ordinary passage to be back in a month: We had not long to consider of the matter, for in an hour's time we heard four muskets discharged, and im|mediately we looked out, and the Spaniards in their Perre-augoe were in sight.

<P>The Spaniards landed being in number twelve, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bastian Lopoz commanding ten soldiers, with one Indian an interpreter.

<P>We received a letter from Solomon, which he writ when he met with Capt. Sebastian Lopoz, signifying the Governor of Augustine's great care for our preservation of what nation soever we were &mdash;but how these persons or the Governor of Au|gustine, had knowledge of us, we could not under|stand, for they had been 14 days from Augustine, which was nigh the time Solomon went from hence, and they met Solomon about half way, and sent him for Augustine with other guides, bring|ing the old Cassekey and his people with them: We observ'd that the old Cassekey seem'd much dejected; we supposed the Spaniards had taken from him the money and what other things he had carried with him, or that he was vexed he should be so deceived in taking us for Spaniards.</P>
<P>The Spaniards were extraordinary kind to us, so that we had occasion to rejoice, and thank the Lord for this part of our deliverance by their means: They were also a terror to the Indians, for they searched their houses, and took all from them that ever they could find, even to the stub of a nail, which aggravated them, and increased their disaf|fection to us-ward, so that we dared not to stir

<P>They then enquired, what became of the boats that belonged to Smith's vessel and ours; we told them that the Indians had taken Smith's boat and sunk her some where in the sound, but ours was at St. a Lucea: The Spaniards made the Indians go and shew where they had sunk Smith's boat, and help our people to get her up, which being done, she was brought to the town, and the Spani|ards were mightily pleased with her, and proposed that they in their canoe, and our people in that boat should go to Hoe-bay, whereby they might get all from the Indians which they had got from us, but we would not countenance the matter: We were for as speedy a departing from amongst these people as we could, since it had pleased GOD to open a way for our deliverance.</P>

<P><PB N="61" REF="025393_0073_0FCD157BB9C379C0">Since they left us, amongst their other hardships Joseph Kirle had like to have lost his life several times; the first was thus; whilst the two canoes were lashed together, having a few berries that were designed to have been shared amongst them, the Irish boy Cornelius Toker, would ever and a|non be taking some of them, who being often re|proved by Joseph Kirle and others, would not de|sist; whereupon Joseph Kirle, with the paddle he paddled the canoe along with, struck him; there|upon an Indian took his bow and arrow, and was going to shoot Joseph, who seemed little concern|ed, whether he lived or died; withal saying, the Spaniards would justify him.</P>
<P>Another time, when he was spent with paddling the canoe, and desired John Smith, Andrew Mur|ray, and others of them, as well able as himself, to give him a spell, which they refused, and he being not able to paddle any further, laid down his paddle; whereupon the Indians commanded him to paddle, but he refused saying, they might kill him if they would, opening his breast for them to execute their wills; which they seemed as though they would have done, but after great threatning they desisted.</P>

<PB N="62" REF="025393_0074_0FCD157FA22E5DC0">
was more satisfactory to him than before, though there were none to help but Nathaniel Randal: My negro woman named Sarah, having beaten &amp; abused a girl named Quenza, and being reproved often by him and Robert Barrow, she therefore abused them in an extraordinary manner; Where|upon Joseph struck her with his paddle, at which, one of the Indians, in the other canoe, took his striking staff and darted at him, narrowly missing him.</P>

<P>This morning Joseph Kirle, with those who were with him, were by the Spanish Captain ordered away by the break of day, he not taking any care to give them a little sustenance; and about an hour or two after we followed rowing all the day, without ceasing, till an hour or two within night, by which time we got to an Indian town, where not any thing was to be had but water; and a|bout two hours after us came Joseph Kirle. The Spanish Captain would not let them come on shore, but ordered them to keep on, that we might get next night to the place where we must haul our boats over land, from one sound to another.</P>

<P>This morning we set forward very early, and rowed hard: About noon we got to a parcel of marshy islands, amongst which we were to go up
<PB N="63" REF="025393_0075_0FCD1581089E3CE0">
creeks, but the passage was very difficult to find; at length when we had got nigh an Indian town, the Spaniards hollowed and an Indian came out in|to the marsh, but was very loth to come near us; at last he came wading to us to be our pilot: We then set forward, and in an hour's time or more we got to the place where Joseph Kirle and those with him were; but the Indians that were with Joseph, would not let them proceed further, till we came up with them. In half an hour's time we got to the place where we were to haul our boats over land, being about a quarter of a mile from sound to sound, at which place the sea was half a furlong from us. The Spanish Captain gave the Indian we last took in, a piece of a leaf of tobacco, commanding him to go with all speed, and bid his Cassekey, with all his able men, to come and help to haul our boats over land; but we set to work, and had them over by that time the Indians came. The Spanish Captain gave the Cassekey a leaf or two of tobacco for himself, and discharged them; only ordered the Cassekey to send some men a fishing for him, which they did, and before night they brought a stately parcel of fish, but none of our people had any part of it, except my wife and Penelope; what they did not eat, they kept to carry with them.</P>
<P>A little before night there sprang up a storm of wind at north-east, and it seemed likely to be a dismal night of wind and rain; we were got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> place where there was not a tree or bush, or any manner of shelter, and the wind so cold, that we
<PB N="64" REF="025393_0076_0FCD15826DAD8EC8">
thought we should not live till next day. We had no wood to make a fire with, and what to do we could not tell; but we were resolved to try to get some, and in order thereto, some of the ablest of us went along the bay to search for drift wood &amp; found a little; but rain came with the night, and no shelter to be had but our boats, which the Span|iards would not suffer us to meddle with to turn them bottom upwards for shelter, which seemed very hard, for they had made themselves some shelter with mats. We were then forced to exer|cise patience, and with what salt water wood we had, made as good a fire as we could, and laid ourselves down on the sand by it, and it pleased God we had a comfortable night, beyond our expecta|tion notwithstanding the cold was very sharp.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>8</HI>th of the ninth month, being the first day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning we set forward, but the water was so low that we were forced to wade, and thrust the boat along for some miles; at length we got into a deep channel, where was nothing to be seen but marsh and water, and no fast land nor trees. About ten o'clock we heard three or four muskets fired a little a-head of us, in the channel we were in, and our Spaniards presently answered them with the like, and in a little time we met. This was a perreaugoe to join with that which came for us, having orders to go to the place where we were cast away, and get what was to be had from the Indians; but she turned back
<PB N="65" REF="025393_0077_0FCD1583DDDF3B68">
with us, for there was no place to go on shore; and in an hour or two's time we got into the other sound, where the land was not to be seen from side to side in some places: The like was in that we came through.</P>
<P>About an hour before sunset we got to an In|dian plantation (this was the first place we saw any thing planted) being full of pompion vines, and some small pompions on them, but the Spaniards were too quick for us, and got most of them be|fore us; nevertheless we got a few as big as one's fift. We made a fire there, yet had not patience to dress them as they should be, but put them into the fire roasted them, and eat them; but the Spaniards used a great deal of cookery with their pompi|ons. The Perreaugoe that came from Augustine had brought bread, corn, and strung-beef, but it was kept from us, except a piece of strung beef the Captain of the Spaniards gave my wife, as big as a stick of sealing wax, which we treasured up, expecting it must be harder with us when we left these people.</P>
<P>Here Captain Sebastian Lopoz drew up a wri|ting, and would have had me and Joseph Kirle to sign it, which we refused; for we perceived he had a design, especially against me, to oblige me to give him some of my negroes. We answered him short, that I reckoned myself and negroes at the Governor of Augustine's disposal, and we would sign no writing. We borrowed a pot, and boiled pompion leaves, having no|thing to put them in but water, which was satis|factory;
<PB N="66" REF="025393_0078_0FCD1587895ED978">
but this night was more terrible than the last, the wind being at north west: it did not blow hard, yet it was very cold, and we lying in an open field, without any shelter, one side of us would scorch, while the other was freezing. Our negro woman Hagar's little boy, named Cajoe, was seized with convulsion fits about two in the morning, which was chiefly occasioned by the cold, and want of food; but help there was not from us. The Spanish captain came to see the child, and supposing that it would die, asked if the child was a christian? He was answered, as good an one as he could make it. But he called for water, putting some of it on the crown of the child's head, and crossing it, called him Francisco. This action pacified his father and mother.</P>

<P>This morning we were to go forward, and the Spaniards were to return to the place where we were cast away; but our two boats could not car|ry us all, therefore we had the Spaniards great per|ry augoe to carry us one day's journey further to an Indian town, and four Spaniards with us, three of which were to bring the perry-augoe back, the other was to be our guide for Augustine. We de|parted, but met with an intricate passage; for sometimes we should be a-ground on oyster-banks, or shoals, and almost out of sight of land. About two or three in the afternoon we had no water to go any further, and the wind being north-westerly
<PB N="67" REF="025393_0079_0FCD15886A99DE58">
drove the water out of the sound; but being nigh the shore, where had been an Indian town, we went thither, and found some ripe berries on the palm shrubs, which we were very earnest after, till such time as a storm of wind, with rain, began to come upon us, and night nigh at hand; whereup|on we all got together, considering what we should do, since there was no possibility of getting shelter here. Our Indian guide said, we might get to a town about two leagues off, which we were glad to hear, for it rained hard: So we, with our guide, set forward, and walked over a parcel of scraggy, shrubby hills, to the sea shore, along which we travelled till we came to the Indian town, where we got plenty of berries for our supper. It rain|ed much till towards morning.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>10</HI>th of the ninth month, being the third day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning the Indians not being willing to stay any longer, we were by our guide required to depart, which we did, and a great many young Indian men followed us several miles along the bay, and offered violence to Robert Barrow, and some others, but they were easily stopped, by shewing them a rusty musket presented towards them, and so they left us. We had an untoward passage from the sea-shore, athwart the land, to the Indian town, the ground being swampy, and scraggy hills, which to our bare feet was very troublesome; but when we came to it, it was a large town, and there was another large town a|bout
<PB N="68" REF="025393_0080_0FCD1589E003A9D8">
a mile distant, in sight, to which part of our company was sent to be quartered: At this town, about a twelve month before, a parcel of Dutch|men were killed, who having been cast away on the Bohemian shoals, they, in a flat which they built, escaped hither, and were devoured by these cannibals, as we understood by the Spaniards.&mdash; The flat, or boat, our people saw; but they seem|ed kind to them, giving them fish and berries to eat. We remained at these two towns till next morning. The Indians of the town I was at, were not so kind as those at the other town had been. Some of our people were for selling their rags to the Indians for fish; but we thought it was ne|cessary, of the two extreams, to defend against the the cold, for every day grew colder than the other, and we feared, that if we were much longer expo|sed to it, we should not live it out.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>11</HI>th of the ninth month, being the fourth day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning we embarked in our two boats, and those of our people, that were at the other town, were to have a large canoe to carry them from thence, and were to meet us in the sound: We rowed several leagues, but did not meet them, it being then about ten o'clock, so the Spaniard would go on shore, and travel back by land to see after them: and we being by an inlet of the sea, which was a mile over, the Spaniard ordered us to go on the other side, and there stay for him; which we did for many hours. At this place we
<PB N="69" REF="025393_0081_0FCD158C25F8C788">
all went upon the search, to see if any thing was to be had for the belly, some on the land, some in the Water: The land yielded nothing, but in the water we got a sort of shell fish, called water sol|diers, which we eat. At length the canoe with our people came, the Spaniard not being with them, but in about half an hours time he came with another small canoe. This was the place where Solomon met the Spaniards. The canoes had each two Indians to set them along, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had one Indian for our guide named Wan Antonia, who the Spaniard said was a christian, but an inhabitant of the town where the Dutchmen were killed. We set forward in our two boats, and the two canoes, and rowed till night, being nigh a place of thickety wood which we made choice of to lodge at for this night &mdash;Here was wood enough, and we made large fires were pleased with the place, and lay down to rest.</P>
<P>About midnight I had a great loss; having a quart of berries whole, and as much pounded to mix with water, to feed our child with, the fire being disturbed, the cloth which we had our food in was burnt, and all was lost, and nothing was to be had till we could get to the Spaniards, which was two days march at least. About an hour af|ter this the wind rose at north-west and it began to rain; but having small Palmetto, which grew nigh, Joseph Kirle and I set to work and made a shelter which would keep ten or more of us from the weather: We had no sooner, compleated our work, but it rained hard. In this shower of rain the four Indians got from among us, took their
<PB N="70" REF="025393_0082_0FCD158D9CD1DE60">
canoes, and away they went back again; when day appeared, we missed them; upon which we went to the water side, where we found the two ca|noes gone. And now we were in a great strait; but the Spaniard said, that those that could travel best must go by land. The persons pitch'd upon were Richard Limpeny, Andrew Murray, Corne|lius Toker, Joseph Kirle's boy, John Hilliard and Penelope; with seven negroes, named, Peter, Jack, Caesar, Sarah, Bella, Susanna, and Quenza; the Spaniard and the Indian Wan-Antonia, went with them to direct the way, carrying them over land to the sea-shore, and then directing to keep the sea-shore along to the northward; after which they returned to us, and we with our boats rowed all day without ceasing, till sunset, and when we put on shore, the place was an old Indian field, on a high bleak hill, where had been a large Indian house, but it was tumbled down; of the ruins of this house we made a shelter against the northwest wind, which began to blow very bleak, and the Spaniard went to the sea, which was not two miles off, to see if our people had past, and at his return he said they were gone by. We asked if they could reach to any house or Indian town for shelter? For we supposed, should they be without fire this night, they could not live: He said, they must travel all night. Night came on, we had fire and wood enough, and had gathered a great heap of grass to lie on, hoping to have got some rest, but the north west wind increased, and the cold was so violent, that we were in a lamentable con|dition,
<PB N="71" REF="025393_0083_0FCD1590D6450CC0">
not being able to rest: for as we lay or stood close to the fire that it would scorch us, the side from it was ready to freeze; so we had no o|ther way but to stand and keep running for the most part of the night, and we all thought we had never felt the like: The Spaniard that was clothed was as bad to bear it as we that were naked. At length day appeared, and we must go.</P>

<P>This morning we were loth to part with our fires but to stay here it could not be; so we went to our boats, wading in the water till it was ready to benumb us, and we put forward, rowing about 2 leagues, then came to an old house, where the Spa|niard told us we must leave the boats and travel by land; we had a boggy marsh to wade thro' for a mile to get to the sea-shore, and had about 5 or 6 leagues along the bay or strand, to the Spanish centinel's house. The north west wind was vio|lent, and the cold such, that the strongest of us thought we should not outlive that day. Having got through the boggy marsh, and on the seashore our people, black and white, made all speed, one not staying for another, that could not travel so fast none but I, with my Wife and child, Robert Bar|row, my kinsman Benjamin Allen, and my negro London, whom I kept to help carry my child, keeping together; the rest of our company had left us, not expecting to see some of us again, especi|ally Robert Barrow, my Wife and child, but we
<PB N="72" REF="025393_0084_0FCD159231DD8890">
travelled after them as well as we could, and ha|ving gone about 2 miles, the cold so seized on my kinsman Benjamin Allen, that he began to be stiff in his limbs staggered and fell, grievously complai|ning that the cold would kill him. Our negro ha|ving the young child, I and my wife took our kinsman under each arm, and help'd him along; but at length his limbs were quite stiff, his speech almost gone, and he began to foam at the mouth. In this strait we knew not what to do, if we staid with him, we must perish also, but we were wil|ling to strive as long as we could, therefore we carried our kinsman and laid him under the bank he not being yet dead, and I resolved to run after our people, some of them not being out of sight; which I did, and left my Wife and child, with the negro to follow as fast as they could. I ran a|bout two miles, making signs to them, thinking if they should look behind and see me running, they mould stop till I got up with them: I was also in hopes, that if I could have accomplished this my design, to have got help to have carried my kinsman along; but they stopped not, and I ran till the wind pierced me so, that my limbs failed me, and I fell, yet still I strove, and getting up, walked backward to meet my wife: As I was returning, I met with the Spaniard coming out of the sand hills, and Joseph Kirle's negro Ben; I made my complaint to the Spaniard, but he not being able to understand me well, went forward; I then applied myself to the negro, ma|king large promises if he would fetch my Kins|man;
<PB N="73" REF="025393_0085_0FCD15939E3419F8">
he offered to go back and use his endeavor, which he did. At length my wife and child came up with me: She was almost overcome with grief expressing in what manner we were forced to part with our kinsman, and expecting that she and the child should go next.</P>
<P>Poor Robert Barrow was a great way behind us, and I feared we should never see him again. I used my endeavor to comfort my wife, intreat|ing her not to let grief overcome her, I had hopes that the Lord would help us in this strait, as he he had done in many since we were in this land; and if it pleased God that we should lay down our lives in this wilderness, that we might beseech him to enable us to do it willingly. Thus striving in a deep exercise of body and mind, we travelled on, admiring God's goodness in preserving us thus far through so many imminent dangers; in the sense of which, a secret hope would arise (though involved with human doubts and fears) That the Lord would yet preserve us.</P>
<P>I took my child from the negro and carried him and having an Indian mat, with a slit in it, through which I put my head, hanging over my breast up|on my waist, under this I carried my child, which helped to break the wind off; but the poor babe was black with cold from head to foot, and its flesh as cold as a stone, yet is was not froward. Its mother would take it now and then, and give it the breast, but little could he get at it; besides, we dared not to stop in the least, for if we did, we should perceive our limbs to fail.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="025393_0086_0FCD15975BB29F38">About two o'clock in the aftetnoon we came up with our negro woman Hagar, with her Child at her back almost dead, and a little further we came up with our negro girl Quenza, being dead, as we thought, for she was as stiff as a dead body could be, and her eyes set; but at length we per|ceived her to breathe, but she had no sense nor motion, and we carried her from the water side under the bank. This increased my wife's sorrow, and she began to doubt she should not be able to travel much further; but I endeavored to encourage her not to leave striving as long as any Ability was left.</P>
<P>All our people were out of sight, except four, and those we had gained upon: I sent my negro to overtake them, and desire them to slacken their pace till we got up with them, being in hopes, that gaining their company would cheer up my wife, but they would not; so the negro stopped for us. We had lost sight of Robert Brarow by this time.</P>
<P>Soon after we overtook John Smith, who was one of the four, and he began to fail, and his com|panions left him; whereupon he made grievious complaints, which I reproved him for, lest he should discourage my wife.</P>
<P>The sun was nigh setting, and we began to look out for the sentinel's post, and my negro at times got upon several of the highest sand hills to look out, but could not see any house, nor the smoak of fire; this was terrible to us all, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being so cold, the night much more, and we
<PB N="75" REF="025393_0087_0FCD159836167368">
not able to travel without rest, being a starved people, both within our bodies and without; and if we ceased from travelling, we should instantly be benumbed and move no further.</P>
<P>In the midst of these reasonings and doubtings we were got into, I espied a man, as I thought, standing on the bank, but at a great distance; I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> afraid to speak, lest it should prove otherwise, but he was soon seen by the whole company, and at length we espied him walking towards the land; this confirmed us, and so we betook to the hills again to look out, yet we could not see the house from thence; but on the next hill we saw it&mdash; This was joy to us, though we began to have a sense of our tiredness; for our resolution abated after we had got sight of the house.</P>
<P>When we got to the house we found four senti|nels, and the Spaniards our guides, with three of our men, viz. Joseph Buckley, Nathaniel Ran|dal, and John Shears, and the Spaniards bid us welcome, making room for us to sit down by the fire. The chiefest man of the sentinels took a kersey coat, and gave it my wife to cover het, and gave each of us a piece of bread made of Indian corn, which was pleasant to us, and afterwards we had plenty of hot Casseena drink. It was dark, but we endeavored to prevail with the Spaniards to go and seek for Robert Barrow and my kinsman offering them considerable; but they seemed not fully to understand me, yet I could make them sensible that my kinsman was almost dead, if not quite, and that the old man was in a bad condi|tion:
<PB N="76" REF="025393_0088_0FCD1599C3D6AA80">
They made me to understand, that the wea|ther was not fit to go out, but they would watch if Robert passed by.</P>
<P>About an hour or two after, one of the Spani|ards being walking nigh the bay, met with Robert, and brought him into the house, at which we re|joiced to see him, and inquired concerning our kinsman, and the Negro Ben: He said, our kins|man was striving to get up, but could not: he came to him, and spake to him and he could not answer, but cried, and he could not help him; but coming along, at some considerable distance, he met negro Ben, who said, he was going for Ben|jamin Allen, so he past him: And some miles fur|ther, he saw negro Jack drawing himself down from the bank, his lower parts being dead, and crying out for some fire that he might save his life; but he did not see the negro girl whom we hauled out of the way.</P>
<P>We were under a great concern for our kins|man; the Spaniards we could not prevail on to go and fetch him, or go and carry wherewith to make a fire; which had they done, and found them living, it might have preserved them; but we hoped negro Ben would bring our kinsman.</P>
<P>The Spaniards would have had most of us to have gone to the next Sentinel's house, which was a league farther, but we all begged hard of them to let us lie at their house, in any place on the ground, for we were not able to travel further: Besides, the cold would kill us; for we were in a trembling shaking condition, and so full of pain
<PB N="77" REF="025393_0089_0FCD159BC3DF39E8">
from head to foot that it is not to be expressed. At length the Spaniards consented that Robert Barrow, I, my wife and child, and John Smith, should lie in the house; but to Joseph Buckley, Nathaniel Randal, John Shears, and my negro London, they would not grant that favor; so one of the Spaniards taking a firebrand, bid those four go with him, and he directed them to a small thicket of trees, and ordered them to gather wood and make large fires, and sleep there. These poor creatures lay out, and it proved a hard frosty night. When the Spaniard returned, he said they were got into a wood, and had fire enough; but we were silent, fearing they would hardly live till morning.</P>
<P>After they were gone, the Spaniards took a pint of Indian corn and parched it, and gave part to us, which we accepted chearfully; also they gave us some Casseena to drink; but we were in extraordinary pain, so that we could not rest, and car feet were extreamly bruised, the skin being off and the sand caked with the blood, so that we could hardly set our feet to the ground, after we had been some time in the house.</P>
<P>The night proved extream cold: Though we were in the house and by the fire, we could not be warm, for the one side did scorch while the other was ready to freeze; and thus we passed that night.</P>

very hard frost on the ground, it was terrible to go out of doors. Our people returned from the wood, but complained heavily of their hardship in the night. They had not been an hour in the house, before the Spaniards gave us all a charge to be gone to the next Sentinel's house: This was grievous to us all, but more especially to my wife who could not raise herself when down; but go we must; for though we intreated hard for my wife and Robert Barrow, we could not prevail that they might stay till we could get a canoe. As we were all going, one Spaniard made a sign for me and my wife to stay, which we did, and it was to have a handful of parch'd corn; as soon as we had re|ceived it, they bid us be gone to the next Senti|nel's, where was victuals enough for us. The sun was a great height, but we could not feel any warmth it gave, the North-wester beginning to blow as hard as it did the day before; and having deep sand to go through, made our travelling this one league very hard, especially to my wife and Robert Barrow; but the Spaniards lent my wife a blanket, to be left at the next Sentinel's house.</P>
<P>At length we came to an inlet of the sea, on the other side whereof was the Look-out and Sentinel's house: Here were all our people sitting, waiting to be carried over, and in a little time came one of the Sentinels with a canoe and carried us over.</P>
<P>This Sentinel would not suffer us to come into his house, but caused us to kindle a fire under the lee of his house, and there sit down: About half an hour after, he bid us be gone to the next Sen|tinel's,
<PB N="79" REF="025393_0091_0FCD159E1E3ADC70">
which was a league further, giving us a cup of Casseena, and two quarts of Indian corn for us all, bidding us go to our company at the next house, and get our corn dressed there.</P>
<P>I understood that our negro woman Hagar, got hither late the night before, having her child dead at her back, which the Spaniards buried.</P>
<P>One of the Spaniards went with us to the next inlet, carrying a stick of fire, to light some trash to make a signal for them on the other side to fetch us over, the inlet being very wide. When the ca|noe came over for us, our guide took the blanket from my wife; but the negro, which brought over the canoe, lent my wife one of his coats, so we got over well; but before we got to the house, we had a shower of hail. At this house we were kindly received, having such a mess of victuals as we had not had in a long time before, which was very pleasant to our hunger-starv'd stomachs.</P>
<P>Our people went from hence this morning for Augustine, having a guide with them; but John Hosler and Penelope were left here, not being able to travel, and we remained here till the next day, but the night was so extreme cold that we could not rest.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>15</HI>th of the <HI>9</HI>th month, being the first day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning the Spaniards bid us prepare to travel, for they were not able to maintain us; and we understanding that it was five or six miles to Augustine, could not travel so far, be|ing
<PB N="80" REF="025393_0092_0FCD159FE4EAA348">
all of us lamed and stiff; therefore we entrea|ted them to let us go in a canoe, but they denied us, we then intreated for the two women and Ro|bert Barrow, and at length we prevailed, that they should go up in a canoe; for the canoe was to go, whether we went or not.</P>
<P>While all this discourse was, came in a couple of Spaniards, one being the sentinel that went with our people the day before: the other was a person the Governor had sent with a canoe and four Spa+niards to fetch us. This was cheerful news; for had we gone to have travelled without a guide, we should have perished. The man that came for us, brought two blankets, one for my wife, the o|ther for Penelope, and he desired us to be going. About a league distance from the place he left the canoe, which we parted with very unwillingly, for some of our people, had they had a mile further to have gone, could not have gone it. The wind still continued at northwest, and blowed very fiercely, and extream cold it was: We had such a continual shivering and pain in our bones, that we were in violent anguish.</P>
<P>Our poor child was quiet, but so black with cold and shaking, that it was admirable how it lived.</P>
<P>We got to Augustine about two hours before night, and being put on shore, we were directed to the Governor's house, where we were had up a pair of stairs, at the head whereof stood the Go|vernor, who ordered my wife to be conducted to his wife's apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="025393_0093_0FCD15A29ED7D7F0">I and John Smith went into a room, where the Governor asked us a few questions; but seeing how extream cold we were, he gave us a cup of Spanish wine, and sent us into his kitchen to warm ourselves at the fire.</P>
<P>About half an hour afterwards, the Governor sent for John Smith and me, and gave each of us a shirt and sliders, a hat and a pair of silk stock|ings, telling us, he had no woollen cloaths as yet, but would have some made: We put on the li|nen, and made all haste into the kitchen to the fire. Robert Barrow was quartered at another house.</P>
<P>Several persons came to the Governor's house, and took such as they were minded to quarter in their houses, but Joseph Kirle, John Smith, I, my Wife and child, lodged at the Governor's house.</P>
<P>All our people that came up with Joseph Kirle came to see us, and we perceived the people's great kindness, for they were all well cloathed from head to foot, with the best the people had.</P>
<P>Joseph Kirle then began to tell us of his travels, after he left us on the bay, and how that they all concluded, that they should never see my wife and child, and Robert Barrow, any more, if they did my kinsman and me. Richard Limpeny, and those that went with him, had a hard travel for thirty six ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs without ceasing, in which three of our negroes, that went with them, were lost, viz. Jack, Caesar and Quenza, by sitting down to rest themselves, who were in a little time so be|numbed that they could not go, and there perished,
<PB N="82" REF="025393_0094_0FCD15A50770ADA8">
so that we lost five in that day's travel, and began to doubt that negro Ben perished also.</P>
<P>Joseph Kirle said, that he thought he should have lost some of our people in their travel from the last sentinel's hither, for they were much tired, and the cold violent; and the latter part of that day's journey, they waded for many miles through much water, and deep sand hills, and when they was in sight of Augustine, they staid for boats to fetch them, in which time some were benumbed with the cold.</P>
<P>Joseph Kirle had applied himself to the Gover|nor on our behalfs, to send us help, for he doubted whether we were all living, and the Governor rea|dily assented, and forthwith sent for a person fit for his purpose, charging him to get a perry-au|goe, and go forthwith to fetch us, but the tide fell out so, that he could not go till midnight: The Governor was so concerned, that he would not go to bed till they were gone, and when the tide served, we went to the water side, and saw the men put off, giving them a strict charge.</P>
<P>Solomon Cresson then began to tell us of his travels from Jece, having for most part of the way much rain: The Indians were very kind to him, till they came to the Indian town where the Dutchmen were killed, at which place, some of the Indians made a discovery of his being no Span|iard: They said nothing to him thereof, but were very dogged, giving him no food, and causing him to lie on the ground amongst virmin.</P>
<P>On the next day he was to go with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="83" REF="025393_0095_0FCD15A6668AED98">
company, who were grown so extream bitter and envious against him, that when they did but look upon him, they were ready to smite him; and having gone till about mid-day, passing an inlet, the weather being extream bad with wind, rain, &amp; much cold, they put on shore (this was the place where we put on shore, and got water-soldiers, &amp; staid for the Spaniard, when he went back to look for our people that were to follow us in a conoe) but the rage of these people was such, that he expect|ed to die: being on shore, they readily kindled a fire, about which time he heard a noise of a boat and oars, and presently the Spanish Perre-augoe put on shore upon them: The Indians were ex|traordinarily surprised, and stood amased, but Sol|omon was glad to see them, and they him. The Spaniards took the old Cassekey's chest, &amp; whatever he had from him, commanding them to return to he Indian towns from whence they came. Staying here all night, the next morning the Spaniard sent Solomon, under the conduct of two Indians belong|ing to these towns, who were commanded by the Spaniards to carry Solomon to the sentinel's house &mdash;but these two Indians carried him a little be|yond the place where we put on shore to travel, and they seemed as though they had mischief in their hearts against him; he asked, if they would go forward? But they looking untowardly on him, answered him not; So he went himself, and was glad when he saw they did not follow him.</P>
<P>Now we were desirous to know, how the Spa|niards had knowledge of us&punc; which it seems was thus:</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="025393_0096_0FCD15A80E505E20">When we got to Jece, where Smith and his company were, and we going under the denomi|nation of Spaniards, and the other English, the report of us run from Indian town to Indian town to the northward, even to the northernmost town, at which town were two or more Indians who were converted to the Romish saith: These, or one of these, went to the next Spanish sentinel's, and gave an account, that he heard that there were two ves|sels cast away to the southard of Jece, one being a Spaniard, the other an English vessel; and the Spaniards having two vessels going for the Havan|na, to seek for supplies, feared they were those vessels; and the same day as this news came to the Governor of Augustine, came also news of one of their friars being murdered by some of the cape Indians; and after this manner we understood it, viz.</P>
<P>Three friars being under a vow to go amongst the Indians on the Cape to convert them, they went to a certain town to the northward, off which we were cast away, but it lay within the sound. The Cassekey of that town they gained on to embrace the Roman faith, but his people were much incensed against the Friars, and there|fore would have their Cassekey renounce his faith, and put the friars to death, but he would assent to neither; therefore they killed him and one fri|ar, the other two escaped. Hereupon was a perre-augoe forthwith sent for us, of what nation soever we might be; also a party of Spaniards and Indians were sent against that town where the friar was killed.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="025393_0097_0FCD15A9DC87A278">After having thus related our several travels, we had a plentiful supper, provided, and we fed like people that had been half starved; for we eat, not knowing when we had enough, and found our palates so changed by eating of the berries, that we could not relish the taste of salt, no more than if it had no saltness in it, we had also lodging pro|vided, but few beds.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>16</HI>th of the ninth month, being the second day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning we had ice half an inch thick, and it had been so for some mornings past but as the sun arose, it desolved.</P>
<P>The Governor came in this morning to our apartment, enquiring how we did? And we hav|ing had chocolate for breakfast, he asked if we would have any thing else that his house could af|ford? If we would but ask, is should be brought us: But we modestly answered that this was suf|ficient; although our appetites were not to be satisfied. The Governor then stated the poverty of the country to us.</P>
<P>This place is a garrison, maintained one half by the King of Spain; the other half by the church of Rome. The male inhabitants are all soldiers, every one receiving pay according to his post; a sentinel's pay is 150 pieces of eight a year; and all their supply of bread, clothing and money, comes from the Havanna and Porta Vella, and it was going on of three years since they had a vessel from any place whatsoever, which made their wants
<PB N="86" REF="025393_0098_0FCD15AAEC1CA9E0">
very great, all things being expended except ammu|nition and salt, of which they said they had enough &mdash;but the Governor offered us the freedom of what his house afforded, withal, he gave us a charge to be careful in going abroad, especially of some persons that did not affect our nation, and we promised to be ruled, and submit to the Governors pleasure for our liberty.</P>
<P>Our people coming in, we told them of the Governor's caution; but they said, they had been all over the town, and in many houses, where they were kindly received, and such as the people had they would give them. They also told us of some English that lived here, and they had been at their houses; the chiefest in esteem was one William Carr, of the Isle of Ely, who about thirty years be|fore was in a vessel bound for South Carolina, but they missing their port, were cast away near Au|gustine, and many were drowned; but he and some others being brought hither by the Indians, some of them got away in Spanish vessels, and others di|ed here. This man turned Roman Catholick, and married a Spanish woman, by whom he had seven children, and is an officer in the garrison; he was our chief interpreter.</P>
<P>This day came Joseph Kirle's negro Ben, and he gave us an account, that after we had sent him back, and he having look'd, and not finding my kinsman, he went to seek for a place to shelter himself from the cold, and a place he found to creep in, where he lay down, and continued all night, but by the morning was so stiff with cold
<PB N="87" REF="025393_0099_0FCD15AC6ABBBA50">
that he could not use his legs, but hauled himself towards the bay; when the Spaniard, our guide from the first sentry house, the morning after we went from thence returning along the bay, to see if any of our people were living, found them all dead ex|cept negro Ben, for whom he made a fire, by which he was recovered and got the use of his limbs.</P>
<P>William Carr the interpreter acquainted us, that the Governor and two royal officers would exa|mine us, concerning our being cast away and what goods and monies was lost in our vessel, and con|cerning our hardships among the Florida Indians &amp;c. which was done and every one did sign it.&mdash; This took up two or three days time to compleat it; but after it was done, the Governor told us, that he expected Capt. Sebastian Lopez in a few days, and after his arrival he would provide for our going to Carolina, with canoes and men to guard us.</P>
<P>This week my wife was taken with a Fever and Ague, which held her three days, and then lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her. The Governor order'd his own doctor to ad+minister such things as were helpful, and his kind|ness to us all was extraordinary; for he woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> daily enquire of us if we wanted any thing which he had of which he gave us an account, and we eat no worse than he did daily.</P>
<P>The town we saw from one end to the other; it is about three quarters of a mile in length not regularly built, nor the houses very thick, they ha|ving large orchars, in which are plenty of Oran|ges, Lemons, Pome-Citrons, Limes, Figs and Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ches:
<PB N="88" REF="025393_0100_0FCD15AE48414418">
The houses are most of them old buildings, and not half of them inhabited, the number of men being about three hundred, who belong to the government, and many of them are kept as senti|nels at their look-outs. At the Northend of the town standeth a large fortification, being a quad|rangle with bastions, and each bastion will contain thirteen guns; but there was not past two thirds of fifty-two mounted. In the curtin they cannot mount any guns, being only for small arms. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the fortification is about thirty feet high, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uilt of saw'd stone, such as they get out of the sand, between the sea and the sound.

<P>This day Joseph Kirle and I, considering that the latter end of the week was talked of, for our setting forward towards Carolina, (which the Spa|niards call St. George's) we concluded to endea|vor to provide ourselves if we could, with clothing, considering we should be exposed to all the wea|ther that might happen, and have no shelter but what we carried with us; therefore we were incli|ned to sell some of our negroes, to provide us clothing and provisions. We addressed ourselves to the Governor, and withal offered him, if he

pleased, to accept the choice of our negroes; but he denied our offer. We then stated the matter to him, and asked, if we might dispose of our ne|groes? He said, No&punc; we should not; neither could we sell them to any person but himself for the King's account, without a special license; there|fore he would consult the two royal officers, and give us his answer.</P>

<P>This day the Governor sent for us, and told us that he would give us credit for what we and the rest of the company wanted. I told him that my wife and child would require some warme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cloth|ing; also Joseph Kirle and myself should want some, if to be had. He ordered us to give in an account of what we should want, and, if to be had we should have it; and that Joseph Kirle and I should give our obligation, to pay the Governor of Carolina what the sum amounted to, which we were willing to do; and then we desired that our people should give us their obligation, for what we were engaged for on their account, which the Governor thought reasonable. I gave in an ac|count of particulars for Joseph Kirle, Robert Bar|row, myself and family: also the quantity of In|dian corn, pease, stringed beef, salt and earthen pots, for the whole company; but clothing was not to be had, except as much stuff as made a suit for my wife and child, and a few skins for Joseph Kirle and I; I got also seven blankets, though the

We had five roves of ammunition bread so full of weavels that corn was far better, twenty roves of strung beef, sixty roves of Indian corn, ten roves of pease, one rove of salt, Jars for water, and earthen pots to boil our victuals in.</P>

<P>This day the Governor sent for Joseph Kirle and me, to certify, that all that was to be got he had provided for us; and he further signified to us, that he did expect Sebastian Lopez before this time, and he would not have us go till he came&punc; for whatsoever he could get of our money and goods we should have it every do it; but we said, we desired not to be detained on that account for we had given that already over for gone from us; and as it had pleased GOD to make them the instruments of our preservation, so we did freely give any thing of that which was, or may be deemed ours, to the Governor, and those persons that were sent for us. The Governor said, he would not have any thing to do with it; for what|ever he did was for charity sake. Then we desi|red the Soldiers might have it if any should be got, which we doubted. And hereupon we con+sidered that should those poor men get nothing, we ought to alllow them something in general; there|fore Joseph Kirle and I offered the Governor, that we would give Captain Sebastian Lopez and his

<P>About this time Robert Barrow was taken with a grievous belly-ach, and afterwards he fell into a violent flux. Several of our people also were tak|en with the belly-ach, and a great scouring, all which was chiefly occasioned by our unreasonable eating, and not governing ourselves therein. Our chief diet was hommony, herbs and pompions, having not much meat, which mean diet was our preservation; for had it been all flesh, we should have destroyed ourselves; but we had the best the place afforded.</P>

and also added,

And thus in a courteous manner we parted, which was about two or three o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Taking our departure from Augustine, we had about two or three leagues to an Indian town called St. a Cruce, where, being landed, we were directed to the Indian warehouse; it was built round, having sixteen squares, and on each square a cabbin built, and painted, which would hold two people, the house being about fifty feet diameter; and in the middle of the top was a square opening about fifteen feet. This house was very clean, and fires being ready made nigh our cabbin, the Spanish captain made choice of cabbins for him and his soldiers, and appointed us our cabbins. In this town they have a friar, and a large house to worship in, with three bells; and the Indians go as constantly to their devotions, at all times and seasons, as any of the Spaniards.&mdash; Night being come, and the time of their devotion over, the Friar came in, and many of the Indians, both men and women, and they had a dance, ac|cording to their way and custom. We had plenty of Casseena drink, and such victuals as the In|dians had provided for us, some bringing corn

We went through a kirt of wood into the Indian plan|tations, for a mile. In the middle of this island is the town of St. Wan's, a large town, and many people; they have a friar, and a worship-house.&mdash; The people are very industrious, having plenty of hogs and fowls, and large crops of corn, as we could tell by their corn houses. The Indians brought us victuals, as at the last town, and we lay in their warehouse, which was larger than that at the other town.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>2</HI>d of the tenth month, called December, being the fourth day of the week.</HEAD>
<P>This morning the Indians brought us victuals for breakfast, and the Friar gave my wife some
<PB N="94" REF="025393_0106_0FCD15BB60FF8E38">
loaves of bread made of Indian corn, which was somewhat extraordinary: also a parcel of fowls.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock in the forenoon we left St. Wan's, walking about a mile to the sound, where were canoes and Indians ready to transport us to the next town: We did believe that we might have come all the way along the sound, but the Spaniards were not willing to discover the place to us.</P>
<P>An hour before sun set we got to the town call|ed St. Mary's: This was a frontier, and a garri|rison town; the inhabitants are Indians, with some Spanish soldiers. We were conducted to the Warehouse, as the custom is, for every town hath a Warehouse: Or, as we understood, these houses were either for their times of mirth and dancing, or to lodge and entertain strangers. The house was about 81 feet diameter, built round, with 32 squares, in each square a cabbin about 8 feet long, of a good height, being painted and well matted. The centre of the building was a quad|rangle of 20 feet, being open at top, against which the house is built: thus in this quadrangle is the place they dance, having a great fire in the mid|dle: One of the squares of this building is the gateway or passage in. The women natives of these towns, cloath themselves with the moss of trees, making gowns and petticoats thereof, which at a distance, or in the night, look very neat. The Indian boys, we saw, were kept to school in the church, the friar being their school master. This was the largest town of all, and about a mile from
<PB N="95" REF="025393_0107_0FCD15BD01215E20">
it was another town called St. Phillip's. At this town of St. Mary's were we to stay till the 5th or 6th instant; where also we were to receive our six|ty roves of corn, and ten roves of pease; and while we staid, we had one half of our corn beaten into meal by the Indians, the other we kept whole, not knowing what weather we should have, for the friar of this town, some years before, was at Charlestown in South Carolina, and he had a month's passage in going, about this time of the year: This news was very unpleasant, to think of lying out a month at this season, having been so weather beaten before: but we endeavored to shun looking back, considering how great our pre|servation had been hitherto.</P>
<P>While we staid here, we were willing to make all the provision we could for back and belly: We got of the Indians plenty of garlick and long pep|per, to season our corn and pease, both which were griping and windy, and we made us wooden trays, and spoons to eat with: We got rushes, and made a sort of platted rope thereof; the use we chiefly intended it for, was to be serviceable to help us in building huts or tents with, at such times as we should meet with hard weather.</P>
<P>The time drawing on that we were to leave this town, we had seven large canoes provided to carry us, being in all about sixty persons; eighteen of us, six of Smith's company, seven Spaniards, and thirty odd Indians, which were to row the canoes, and be our pilots. We had some Indians from all the towns, and two Cassekeys.</P>

<P>About two or three leagues from hence, we came in sight of an Indian town called Sappataw, but we went about a league to the northward of it to a sentinel's house, where we put on shore, and had Casseena brought us, making no stay; but we went from hence, rowing till next morning, and in the night we had lost our way, but got to rights in a little time.</P>

<P>This morning about sunrising we saw a canoe of Carolina Indians going to the southward a hunt|ing, they kept the western side of the sound, being fearful of us; but we had a canoe manned with Indians and Spaniards, to go after them, to speak with them, being desirous to get them to carry let|ters to inform of our coming, not knowing but we might alarm the out settlements of Carolina.</P>
<P>This canoe of ours pursued the other, but the Carolina Indians put on shore, run into a marsh, and fired at our people; the Spanish Indians who could speak the Yammaw's language, called to them, and told them their business, withal, intrea|ting them to come to them; but they answered, that they were going a hunting for the season, therefore desired them to be gone, for they would not come near them: Thus our people returned to us, and the Carolina Indians went their way, and we prepared to go forward. We having the Cassekey of St. Wans with us, sent him away the night before to see if he could meet any of the Yammawsee-Indians of Carolina, he being ac|quainted

with, and related to them; but this ca|noe had passed him. We set forward, and row|ed all the day till about an hour before sunset, and then we put on shore at an Indian field, which was overgrown with sedge, it being low, wet land; here we made our accustomed provision for lodg|ing, lying this night in a wood; and having dres|sed victuals for this time and the next day, and ha|ving rested well about day break or sooner, we left this place.</P>

<P>This day about ten o'clock, we cross'd an inlet but the tide being against us, we put on shore at an old Indian field&punc; at which place, under the shelter of some trees, we met the Cassekey of St. Wans; and here we staid and drank some Cassee|na. There was abundance of rabbits, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made no stay.

<P>We had a large field to lie in, and no manner of shelter but what was a mile distant or more; but we spared not pains, for some fell to cutting of boughs and brush, at that great distance, some to carrying it to the place, some to get firewood, so that by night we had a brave shelter.</P>
<P>The Spanish Captain sent for me, to write to the Governor of Carolina, which I did; and I wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> also to a person of my acquaintance there. The letters being finished, and night coming on, I delivered my letters to the Captain, and return|ed to my company. By this time they had com|pleated our booth, which we thought was sufficient if no rain fell. We then provided our victuals for our supper, and for our next day's travel, as also some dry grass to lie on, in hopes of resting well this night. About ten at night the Carolina-In|dians went with our letters for Carolina.</P>

<P>This morning, about two hours before day, we had a gust of wind at the northwest, and the sky was overcast, and look'd as though we should have abundance of rain; in a little time the rain fell, against which we had no shelter but our blankets, and it held till break of day, at which time the northwest wind began to blow violent hard and cold. Our shelter was fronting the north west, and we fell to work to shift our booth, and to get|ting more boughs, brush and grass; the grass was

<P>This day the wind continued without ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sing. We began to mend what the fire had put out of order by night, and heaved up more earth on our booth, and made some enlargement; for we were not negligent by day to provide for the night, which pinched us with cold, especially aged Rob|ert Barrow, who having a violent flux, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> held him from Augustine hither, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> cold being grown on him, so that he could not govern his weekness, nor get his natural rest; he was so extreamly racked with the cold that, in this juncture of hardship we could get no warmth in him; but he was contented with our mean help, although he received little benefit by it.&mdash; This day, at times we went out to get wood, hav|ing along way to go in an open field, and the cold almost benumbing us, by that time we could get to the booth.

The Spanish Indians hunt|ed all these three days and killed several deer, but they eat them as fast as they killed them, ha|ving little or no other provision, their corn being spent.</P>

<P>This morning we embarked, and set forward, having fair weather, and the wind down, we rowed all day till three o'clock, being come to a great inlet of the sea, but the weather look'd as though we should have wind and rain; and to cross the inlet would be dangerous, it being about two leagues over, and little wind making a rough sea: So we put on shore, it being high land, and lofty woods, mostly pine and live oaks:</P>
<P>Here we made all the expedition we could to get shelter against the weather. The Indians set to work to build themselves little huts or wigwams, which they had not done till now. They got small

By night we had a great deal of rain and wind. And it being the evening of the Spaniards Christmas, they used some of their ceremonies, with tinkling on a piece of iron, and singing, begging for somewhat for the day fol|lowing; they begged of the Indians, and the In|dians in like manner begged of the Spaniards, and what the Indians gave the Spaniards, that was re|turned to the Indians.</P>

<P>This morning was very foggy, and proved a rainy day, but we kept rowing till two in the af|ternoon; the rain being hard, and the wind in|creased at north-east. We put on shore, but the captain told us we should not stay here long, he intending to go further, and if the weather per|mitted, would go all night, but the weather was likelier to be worse than better, and so we sat in the rain till night was come, when we intreated the Captain, that we might stay there all night, and that we might provide against the weather; but he pretended the weather would break up, and he would be gone; but there was no likelihood of it, for the rain increased, and we were all wet and starved with cold; at length he assented to stay: Then were we hard put to it (being night) to pro|vide shelter; but in the dark did we work till we had made us a shelter that would keep the rain

After we past this, we came into a great sound, which went down into a large inlet, that the land could not be seen from the one side to the other: Into the sound comes down a great river, called the Sabina river, which, when we got into the course of, the water was fresh, though in this great sound: the Spaniards called it the cross-bar, or St. a Cruce. About noon we got over the sound, and here we rowed out to sea, for two leagues, to get into another sound; About three o'clock, the wind began to blow at north-east, and it looked very black, so that we feared a storm. We desi|red to get on shore to provide against it, but the captain said, about a few leagues further we should get near Port-Royal; but in the interim we saw a canoe on the shore, and we made to her, and there we found some Indian wigwams: Here we went on shore. This was a canoe laden with skins, that belonged to merchants at Carolina hav|ing four Indians in her; but three of them run away, fearing the Spaniards.</P>
<P>The Indian wigwams were in a bad condition, not fit to keep out the weather, so we set to work to mend them, and here being plenty of palmetto leaves, we covered them, and made addition to them; but the storm of wind and rain came vio|lently before we could compleat our work, and held all night; yet we lay indifferent dry, though the storm was very great.</P>
