<HEAD>A NARRATIVE
Of the Captivity and Restauration <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
Mrs. Mary Rowlandson.</HEAD>
<P>ON the tenth of <HI>February</HI> came the <HI>In|dians</HI>
with great Numbers upon <HI>Lan|caster:</HI>
Their first coming was about
Sun-rising; hearing the noise of
some Guns, we looked out; several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ouses
were burning, and the Smoke ascending to
Heaven. There were five Persons taken in one
House, the Father, and the Mother, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">
sucking Child they knockt on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> head; the
other two they took and carried away alive.
There were two others, who being out o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> their
Garrison upon some Occasion, were set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">pon:
one was knockt on the head, the other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">.
Another there was who running along was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">

split open his Bowels. Another seeing many
of the Indians about his Barn, ventured and
went out, but was quickly shot down. There
were three others belonging to the same Garri|son
who were killed; the <HI>Indians</HI> getting up
vpon the Roof of the Barn, had advantage to
shoot down upon them over their Fortification.
Thus these murtherous wretches went on bur|ning
and destroying before them.</P>
<P>At length they came &amp; beset our own house,
and quickly it was the dolefullest Day that ever
mine eyes saw. The House stood upon the
edge of a Hill; some of the <HI>Indians</HI> got behind
the Hill, others into the Barn, and others behind
any thing that would shelter them; from all
which places they shot against the House, so that
the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">llets seemed to fly like Hail; and quickly
they wounded one man among us, then another,
and then a third. About two hours (according
to my Observation in that amazing time) they
had been about the House before they prevail|ed
to fire it, (which they did with Flax and
H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> which they brought out of the Barn, and
there being no Defence about the House, only 2

them not finished) they fired it once, and one

others) but now mine Eyes see it. Some in
our House were fighting for their Lives, others
wallowing in their Blood, the House on fire o|ver
our heads, and the bloody Heathen ready
to knock us on the head if we stirred out. Now
might we hear Mothers and Children crying
out for themselves, and one another, <HI>Lord what
shall we do!</HI> Then I took my Children (and one
of my Sisters hers) to go forth and leave the
House: but as soon as we came to the door, and
appeared, the <HI>Indians</HI> shot so thick, that the bul|lets
rattled against the House, as if one had ta|ken
an handful of Stones and threw them, so
that we were forced to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ve <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ack. We had six
stout Dogs belonging to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ur Garrison, but none
of them would stir, though another time, if an
<HI>Indian</HI> had come to the Door, they were ready
to fly upon him and tear him down. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Lord
hereby would make us the more to acknowledge
his Hand, and to see that our Help is always in
him. But out we must go, the fire increa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech">g,

seem) thorough the Bowels and Hand of my
poor Child in my Arms. One of my elder Sis|ters
Children (named <HI>William</HI>) had then his
Leg broke, which the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving, they
knockt him on head. Thus were we butchered
by those merciless Heathen, standing amazed,
with the Blood running down to our heels. My
elder Sister being yet in the House, and seeing
those woful sights, the Infidels haling Mothers
one way, and Children another, and some wal|lowing
in their Blood: And her eldest Son tel|ling
her that her Son <HI>William</HI> was dead, and
my self was wounded, she said, And <HI>Lord, let

she was struck with a Bullet, and fell down dead
over the Threshold. I hope she is reaping the
fruit of her good Labours, being faithful to the
Service of God in her place. In her younger
Years she lay under much trouble upon spiritu|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">&punc;

Oh! the doleful sight that now was to be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">old

Of thirty seven Persons who were in this one

<P>Now away we must go with those Barbarous

a mile we went that night, up upon a hill
within sight of the Town, where they intended
to lodge. There was hard by a vacant House,
(deserted by the <HI>English</HI> before, for fear of the <HI>In|dians</HI>)
I ask<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d them whether I might not lodge in
the House that night? to which they answered,
What will you love <HI>English-men</HI> still? This was
the dolefullest night that ever my eyes saw. Oh
the roaring, and singing, and dancing, &amp; yelling
of those black creatures in the night, which <HI>made</HI>

of the former Day, and the dismalness of the

<HI>Indians</HI> told me they would kill him as he came

<P>But now (the next morning) I must turn my
back upon the Town, and travel with them in|to
the vast and desolate Wilderness, I know not
whither. It is not my Tongue or Pen can ex|press
the sorrows of my Heart, and bitterness of
my Spirit, that I had at this departure: But God
was with me in a wonderful manner, carrying
me along, and bearing up my Spirit, that it did
not quite fail. One of the <HI>Indians</HI> carried my
poor wounded Babe upon a Horse; it went moan|ing
all along, I shall die, I shall die. I went on
foot after it, with Sorrow that cannot be exprest.
At length I took it off the Horse, and carried it
in my arms, till my strength failed, &amp; I fell down
with it. Then they set me upon a Horse, with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">y wounded Child in my Lap, and there being
no Furniture upon the Horse back, as we were
going down a steep Hill, we both fell over the
Horses head, at which they like inhumane Crea|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ures
laught, and rejoyced to see it, though I
thought we should there have ended our Days,
as overcome with so many Difficulties. But the
Lord renewed my strength still, and carried me
along, that I might see more of his Power, yea,
so much that I could never have thought of,
had I not experienced it.</P>
<P>After this it quickly began to Snow, and when

behind me, with my sick Child in my lap, and
calling much for Water, being now (thorough
the Wound) fallen into a violent Fever. My
own Wound also growing so stiff, that I could
scarce sit down or rise up, yet so it must be, that
I must sit all this cold Winter Night, upon the
cold snowy Ground, with my sick Child in my
arms, looking that every Hour would be the
last of its Life; and having no Christian Friend
near me, either to comfort or help me. Oh I

except only a little cold Water. This Day in
the Afternoon, about an Hour by Sun, we came
to the Place where they intended, <HI>viz.</HI> an <HI>In|dian</HI>
Town called <HI>We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">imesset,</HI> Northward of <HI>Qua|baug.</HI>
When we were come, Oh the number of
<HI>Pagans</HI> (now merciless Enemies) that there came
about me, that I may say as <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 27. 13.
<HI>I had fainted, unless I had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">lieved,</HI> &amp;c. The next
Day was the Sabbath: I then remembred how
careless I had been of God's holy Time: how
many Sabbaths I had lost and mispent, &amp; how
evily I had walked in God's sight; which lay
so c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ose upon my Spirit, that it was easie for
me to see how Righteous it was with God to
cut off the thread of my Life, and cast me out
of his presence for ever. Yet the Lord still
shewed Mercy to me, and helped me; and as
he wounded me with one Hand, so he healed
me with the other. This Day there came to
me one <HI>Robert Pepper,</HI> (a Man belonging to <HI>Rox|bury,</HI>)
who was taken at Capt. <HI>Beers</HI> his Fight;
and had been now a considerable time with the
Indians, and up with them almost as far as <HI>Albany</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ee King <HI>Philip,</HI> as he told me, and was now

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> I say, that I was in this <HI>Indian</HI> Town,
he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech">ained leave to come and see me. He told

go but as they carried him, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> took

Oak Leaves and laid to his Wound, and by the
Blessing of God, he was able to Travel again.
Then I took Oak Leaves and laid to my Side,
and with the Blessing of God, it cured me also;
yet before the Cure was wrought, I may say as
it is in <HI>Psal. 38. 5, 6. My Wounds Stink and are
Corrupt, I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I
go Mourning all the day long.</HI> I sate much alone
with my poor wounded Child in my Lap, which
moaned Night and Day, having nothing to re|vive
the Body, or chear the Spirits of her; but
instead of that, one <HI>Indian</HI> would come and tell
me one hour, your Master will knock your Child
on the head, and then a second, and then a third,
your Master will quickly knock your Child on
the head.</P>
<P>This was the Comfort I had from them;
Miserable Comforters were they all. Thus nine
Days I sate upon my Knees, with my Babe in
my Lap, till my Flesh was raw again. My Child
being even ready to depart this sorrowful <HI>World,</HI>
they bid me carry it out to another Wigwam;
(I suppose because they would not be troubled
with such Spectacles) Whither I wen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> with a

without any Refreshing of one nature or
other, except a little cold Water. I cannot but
take notice, how at another time I could not bear
to be in the room where any dead Person was,
but now the case is changed; I must, and could
lie down by my dead Babe all the Night after.
I have thought since of the wonderful Good|ness
of God to me, in preserving me so in the
use of my Reason and Senses, in that distressed
time, that I did not use wicked and violent
Means to end my own miserable Life. In the
Morning, when they understood that my Child
was dead, they sent for me home to my Masters
Wigwam: (By my Master in this Writing, must
be understood <HI>Quannopin,</HI> who was a Saggamore,
and married K. <HI>Philip</HI>'s Wives Sister; not that
he first took me, but I was sold to him by a <HI>Nar|raganset
Indian,</HI> who took me when I first came
out of the Garrison) I went to take up my dead

away this dear Child, I went to see my Daugh|ter
<HI>Mary,</HI> who was at this same <HI>Indian</HI> Town,
at a Wigwam not very far off, though we had
little liberty or opportunity to see one another:
She was about ten Years old, and taken from
the Door at first by a Praying <HI>Indian,</HI> and after|ward
sold for a Gun. When I came in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ight, she
would fall a Weeping, at which they were pro|voked,
and would not let me come near her,
but bid me be gone; which was a Heart cutting
Word to me. I had one Child dead, another in

they would not let me come near to; <HI>Me</HI> (as he
said) <HI>have ye bereaved of my Children, Ios<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ph is not,

of my Condition, and that I should have Chil|dren,

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">e a Token for Good, and if it were his blessed

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ndeed quickly the Lord answered, in some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">easure, my poor Prayer: For as I was going
up and down mourning and lamenting my Con|dition,
<PB N="16" REF="002173_0016_0F52A9BFD510E608">
my Son came to me, and asked me how
I did? I had not seen him before, since the de|struction
of the Town; and I knew not where
he was, till I was informed by himself, that he
was amongst a smaller parcel of <HI>Indians,</HI> whose
place was about six Miles off, with tears in his
eyes, he asked me whether his Sister <HI>Sarah</HI> was
dead? and told me he had seen his Sister <HI>Mary;</HI>
and prayed me, that I would not be troubled in
reference to himself. The occasion of his com|ing
to see me at this time was this: There was,
as I said, about six Miles from us, a small Plan|tation
of <HI>Indians,</HI> where it seems he had been du|ring
his Captivity; and at this time, there were
some Forces of the <HI>Indians</HI> gathered out of our
Company, and some also from them, (amongst
whom was my Sons Master) to go to assault and
burn <HI>Medfield:</HI> In this time of his Masters Ab|sence,
his Dame brought him to see me. I took
this to be some gracious Answer to my earnest
and unfeigned Desire. The next Day the <HI>India<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"></HI>
returned from <HI>Medfield:</HI> (all the Company, for
those that belonged to the other smaller Com|pany,
came through the Town that now we
were at) But before they came to us, Oh the
outrageous Roaring and Hooping that there
was! They began their din about a Mile before
they came to us. By their Noise and H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ping
they signified how many they had destroyed:
(which was at that time twenty three) Thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
<PB N="17" REF="002173_0017_0F52A9C042997760">
that were with us at home, were gathered toge|ther
as soon as they heard the Hooping, and
every time that the other went over their num|ber,
these at home gave a shout, that the very
Earth rang again. And thus they continued till
those that had been upon the Expedition w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
come up to the Saggamor's Wigwam; and then
Oh the hideous Insulting and Triumphing that
there was over some <HI>English</HI> Mens Scalps, that
they had taken (as their manner is) and brought
with them. I cannot but take notice of the
wonderful Mercy of God to me in those Afflicti|ons,
in sending me a <HI>Bible:</HI> One of the <HI>Indians</HI>
that came from <HI>Medfield</HI> Fight, and had brought
some Plunder, came to me, and asked me if I
would have a <HI>Bible,</HI> he had got one in his Basket.
I was glad of it, and asked him if he thou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech">
the <HI>Indians</HI> would let me Read? he answered
yes; so I took the <HI>Bible,</HI> and in that melancholy
Time, it came into my Mind to Read first the
28th Chap. of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which I did&punc; and
when I had read it, my dark Heart wrought on
this manner, That there was no Mercy for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
that the Blessings were gone, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
came in their room, and that I had lost my op|portunity.
But the Lord helped me still to go
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> reading, till I came to Chap. 30. the Seven
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">; where I found there was Mercy

poor Woman before mentioned, who came to
a sad end, as some of the Company told me in
my Travel: She having much Grief upon her
Spirits, about her miserable Condition, being
so near her Time, she would be often asking
the <HI>Indians</HI> to let her go home; they not being
willing to that, and yet vexed with her Impor|tunity,
gathered a great Company together
about her, and stript her naked, and set her in
the midst of them; and when they had Sung
and Danced about her (in their hellish manner)
as long as they pleased, they knockt her on the
head, and the Child in her Arms with her:

one Tear, but prayed all the while. But to re|turn
to my own Journey: We travelled about
half a Day or a little more, and came to a de|solate
Place in the Wilderness, where there
were no Wigwams or Inhabitants before: We
came about the middle of the Afternoon to this
place; cold and wet, and snowy, and hungry,
and weary, and no Refreshing (for Man) but
the cold Ground to sit on, and our poor <HI>Indian</HI>
Cheer.</P>
<P>Heart-aking Thoughts here I had about my
poor Children, who were scattered up and down
among the wild Beasts of the Forest: My Head
was Light and Dissy, (either through Hunger or
hard Lodging, or Trouble, or altogether) my
Knees Feeble, my Body Raw by sitting double
Night and Day, that I cannot express to Man,
the Affliction that lay upon my Spirit, but the Lord
helped me at that time to express it to himself.
I opened my <HI>Bible</HI> to Read, and the Lord brought
that precious Scripture to me, <HI>Ier. 31. 16. Thus
saith the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and
thine Eyes from Tears, for they Work shall be Rewar|ed,
and they shall come again from the Land of the
Enemy.</HI> This was a sweet Cordial to me, when
I was ready to Faint, many and many a time,
have I sat down, and wept sweetly over this
Scripture. At&punc; this place we continued about

<P>The occasion (as I thought) of their moving
at this time, was the <HI>English</HI> Army's being near
and following them: For they went as if they
had gone for their Lives, for some considerable
way; and then they made a stop, and chose out
some of their stoutest Men, and sent them back
to hold the <HI>English</HI> Army in play whilst the rest
escaped; and then like <HI>Iehu</HI> they marched on
furiously, with their old and young: Some car|ried
their old decriped Mothers, some carried
one, and some another. Four of them carried
a great <HI>Indian</HI> upon a Bier; but going through
a thick Wood with him, they were hindred, and
could make no haste; whereupon they took
him upon their backs, and carried him one at
a time, till we came to <HI>Bacquag</HI> River. Upon a
<HI>Friday</HI> a little Afternoon we came to this River:
When all the Company was come up, and were
gathered together, I thought to count the num|ber
of them, but they were so ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">y, and being

this Travel, because of my Wound, I was some|what
favoured in my Load: I carried only my
Knitting-work, and two quarts of parched Meal:
Being very faint, I asked my Mistress to give me
one Spoonful of the Meal, but she would not
give me a taste. They quickly fell to cutting
dry Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">s, to make Rafts to carry them over the
<PB N="22" REF="002173_0022_0F52A9C3F779DBC8">
River, and soon my turn came to go over. By
the advantage of some Brush which they had
laid upon the Raft to sit on, I did not wet my
Foot, (which many of themselves at the other
end were mid-leg deep) which cannot but be
acknowledged as a favour of God to my wea|kened
Body, it being a very cold time. I was not
before acquainted with such kind of doings, or
dangers. <HI>When thou passest thorough the Waters I

of us got over the River that Night, but it was
the Night after the Sabbath before all the Com|pany
was got over. On the <HI>Saturday</HI> they boy|led
an old Horse's Leg (which they had got) and
so we drank of the Broth, as soon as they
thought it was ready, and when it was almost
all gone, they filled it up again.</P>
<P>The first Week of my being among them, I
hardly ate any thing: The second Week I found
my Stomach grow very Faint for want of some|thing;
and yet 'twas very hard to get down
their filthy Trash; but the third Week (though
I could think how formerly my Stomach would
turn against this or that, and I could starve and
die before I could eat such things, yet) they
were pleasant and savoury to my taste. I was at
this time Knitting a pair of white <HI>Cotten</HI> Stock|ings
for my Mistress, and I had not yet wrought
upon the Sabbath Day: When the Sabbath came,
<PB N="23" REF="002173_0023_0F52A9C4C21DD6F0">
they bid me go to work; I told them it was

to which th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">y answered me, they would break

to be a Bait, the Devil lays to make Men lose
their precious Time. I remember with Shame,
how formerly, when I had taken two or three
Pipes, I was presently ready for another; such
a bewitching thing it is: But I thank God, he
has now given me power over it; surely there
are many who may be better employed, than to
sit sucking a stinking Tobacco-pipe.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Indians</HI> gather their Forces to go
against <HI>North-Hampton:</HI> Over Night one went
about yelling and hooting to give Notice of the
Design. Whereupon they went to Boyling of
Ground-Nuts, and parching of Corn, (as many
as had it) for their Provision; and in the Morn|ing
away they went. During my abode in this
place, <HI>Philip</HI> spake to me to make a Shirt for his
Boy, which I did; for which he gave me a Shil|ling;
I offered the Money to my Master, but he
bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> me keep it, and with it I bought a piece
of Horse-flesh. Afterward he asked me to make
a Cap for his Boy, for which he invited me to
Dinner: I went, and he gave me a Pan-cake, a|bout
as big as two Fingers; it was made of par|ched
Wheat, beaten, and fryed in Bears-grease,
but I thought I never tasted pleasanter Meat in
my Life. There was a Squaw who spake to me
to make a Shirt for her Sannup; for which she
gave me a piece of Bear. Another asked me to
Knit a pair of Stockings, for which she gave me
a quart of Pease. I boyled my Pease and Bear
<PB N="30" REF="002173_0030_0F52A9CAC3FCEB78">
together, and invited my Master and Mistress to
Dinner; but the proud Gossip, because I served
them both in one Dish, would eat nothing, except
one bit that he gave her upon the point of his
Knife. Hearing that my Son was come to this
place, I went to see him, and found him lying
flat upon the Ground; I asked him how he
could Sleep so? he answered me, that he was
not asleep, but at Prayer; and that he lay so,
that they might not observe what he was doing.
I pray God he may remember these things now
he is returned in safety. At this place, (the Sun
now getting higher) what with the beams and
heat of the Sun, and the smoke of the Wig|wams,
I thought I should have been blind. I
could scarce discern one Wigwam from another.
There was here one <HI>Mary Thurston</HI> of <HI>Medfield,</HI>
who seeing how it was with me, lent me a Hat
to wear; but as soon as I was gone, the Squaw
who owned that <HI>Mary Thurston,</HI> came running
after me, and got it away again. Here was a
Squaw who gave me a Spoon-full of Meal, I
put it in my Pocket to keep it safe, yet not|withstanding
some body stole it, but put five
<HI>Indian</HI> Corns in the room of it; which Corns
were the greatest Provision I had in my Travel
for one Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> returning from <HI>North-Hampton,</HI>
brought with them some Horses, and Sheep, and
other things which they had taken; I desired
<PB N="31" REF="002173_0031_0F52A9CB76858118">
them that they would carry me to <HI>Albany</HI> upon
one of those Horses, and sell me for Powder;
for so they had some times discoursed. I was ut|terly
hopeless of getting home on Foot, the
way that I came. I could hardly bear to think
of the many weary Steps I had taken, to come
to this place.</P></DIV2>

<P>But instead of going either to <HI>Albany</HI> or home|ward,
we must go five Miles up the River, and
then go over it. Here we abode a while. Her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
lived a sorry <HI>Indian,</HI> who spake to me to make
him a Shirt, when I had done it, he would pay
me nothing for it. But he living by the River
side, where I often went to fetch Water, I would
often be putting of him in mind, and calling
for my pay; at last he told me, if I would make
another Shirt for a Papoos not yet born, he
would give me a Knife, which he did, when I
had done it. I carried the Knife in, and my
Master asked me to give it him, and I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> not
a little glad that I had any thing that they
would accept of, and be pleased with. When
we were at this place, my Masters Maid came
home; she had been gone three Weeks into
the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country to fetch Corn, where
they had stored up some in the Ground: She
brought home about a peck and half of Corn.
<PB N="32" REF="002173_0032_0F52A9CD0AA455B0">
This was about the time that their great Cap|tain

<P>My Son being now about a Mile from me,
I asked liberty to go and see him, they bid me
go, and away I went; but quickly lost my self,
travelling over Hills and thorough Swamps, and
could not find the way to him. And I cannot
but admire at the wonderful Power and Good|ness
of God to me, in that though I was gone
from home, and met with all sorts of <HI>Indians,</HI>
and those I had no knowledge of, and there be|ing
no Christian Soul near me, yet not one of
them offered the least imaginable Miscarriage
to me. I turned homeward again, and met with
my Master, and he shewed me the way to my
Son. When I came to him, I found him not
well; and withal he had a Boil on his Side,
which much troubled him: We bemoaned one
another a while, as the Lord helped us, and
then I returned again. When I was returned, I
found my self as unsatisfied as I was before. I
went up and down Mourning and Lamenting,
and my Spirit was ready to sink, with the
thoughts of my poor Children: My Son was
ill, and I could not but think of his mournful
Looks, having no Christian Friend <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> him,
to do any Office of Love for him, either for
Soul or Body. And my poor Girl, I knew not
where she was, nor whether she was sick, or
<PB N="33" REF="002173_0033_0F52A9CE0CD3FF20">
well, or alive, or dead. I repaired under these
thoughts to my Bible, (my great Comforter in
that time) and that Scripture came to my hand,
<HI>Cast thy Burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain
thee,</HI> Psal. 55. 22.</P>
<P>But I was fain to go look after something
to satisfy my Hunger: And going among the
Wigwams, I went into one, and there found a
Squaw who shewed her self very kind to me,
and gave me a piece of Bear. I put it into my
Pocket, and came home; but could not find an
opportunity to Broil it, for fear they should get
it from me; and there it lay all that Day and
Night in my stinking Pocket. In the Morning
I went again to the same Squaw, who had a
Kettle of Ground-Nuts Boyling: I asked her
to let me boyl my piece of Bear in her Kettle,
which she did, and gave me some Ground-Nuts
to eat with it, and I cannot but think how
pleasant it was to me. I have sometimes seen
Bear baked handsomely amongst the <HI>English,</HI>
and some liked it, but the thoughts that it was
Bear, made me tremble: But now that was sa|voury
to me that one would think was enough
to turn the Stomach of a Brute-Creature.</P>
<P>One bitter cold Day, I could find no room
to sit dowr before the Fire: I went out, and
could not tell what to do, but I went into ano|ther
Wigwam, where they were also sitting
round the Fire; but the Squaw laid a Skin for

me, and bid me sit down, and gave me some
Ground-Nuts, and bid me come again; and
told me they would buy me, if they were able;
and yet these were Strangers to me that I ne|ver

<P>It was upon a Sabbath-day Morning, that
they prepared for their Travel. This Morning
I asked my Master whether he would sell me
to my Husband? he answered <HI>Nux;</HI> which did
much rejoyce my Spirit. My Mistress, before
we went, was gone to the Burial of a <HI>Papoos,</HI>

my Hand, and threw it out of doors; I ran out

and never let her see it afterward. Then they
packed up their things to be gone, and gave
me my Load: I complained it was too heavy,
whereupon she gave me a slap on the Face, and
bid me be gone. I lifted up my H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">rt to God,

But the thoughts of my going homeward,
(for so we bent our course) much cheared my
my Spirit, and made my Burden seem Light,
and almost nothing at all. But (to my amaze|ment
and great perplexity) the Scale was soon
turned; for when we had gone a little way,
on a sudden my Mistress gave out, she would go
no further, but turn back again, and said I must
go back again with her, and she called her
Sannup, and would have had him go back also,
but he would not; but said, he would go on,
and come to us again in three Days. My Spirit
was upon this (I confess) very Impatient, and
almost Outragious. I thought I could as well
have died as went back. I cannot declare the
Trouble that I was in about it; but yet back
again I must go. As soon as I had an opportu|nity,
I took my Bible to Read, and that quiet|ing

<HI>Be still, and know that I am God.</HI> Which stilled
my Spirit for the present; but a sore time of

going out to see what I could find, and walk|ing

to me. Toward Night I gathered me some
Sticks for my own Comfort, that I might not
lye a Cold: But when we came to lye down,
they bid me go out, and lye somewhere else,
for they had Company (they said) come in
more than their own: I told them I could not
tell where to go, they bid me go look: I told
them, if I went to another Wigwam they would
be angry, and send me home again. Then one
of the Company drew his Sword, and told me
he would run me thorough, if I did not go pre|sently.
Then was I fain to stoop to this rude
Fellow, and to go out in the Night I knew not
whither. Mine eyes have seen that Fellow after|wards
walking up and down in <HI>Boston,</HI> under
the appearance of a <HI>Friendly Indian,</HI> and seve|ral

Here one asked me to make a Shirt for

himself was gone, and I left behind, so that
my Spirit was now quite ready to sink. I asked
them to let my go out and pick up some Sticks,
that I might get alone, and pour out my Heart

Upon the Sabbath-days I could look upon the

must lye down on the Ground I cannot express

and Painting her Face, going with her Neck|laces,
with Jewels in her Ears, and Bracelets

<P>Then came <HI>Tom</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> with the second

Hang him, Rogue, (says he) I will knock out

they would do them no hurt. So unstable and

there were some thoughts of his coming to Re|deem

follow; for there was little more trust to them,

had a Brother that would not eat Horse, his
Conscience was so Tender and Scrupulous,
(though as large as Hell, for the Destruction of
poor Christians) Then he said, he read that
Scripture to him, 2 <HI>King. 6. 25. There was a Fa|mine
in Samaria, and behold they besieged it, until an
Asses head was sold for fourscore pieces of Silver,
and the fourth part of a Kab of Doves Dung, for
five pieces of Silver.</HI> He expounded this place to
his Brother, and shewed him that it was lawful
to eat that in a Famine, which is not at ano|ther
time. And now says he, he will eat Horse
with any <HI>Indian</HI> of them all. There was another
Praying <HI>Indian,</HI> who when he had done all the
Mischief that he could, betrayed his own Fa|ther
into the <HI>English</HI>'s Hands, thereby to pur|chase
his own Life. Another Praying <HI>Indian</HI> was
at <HI>Sudbury</HI> Fight, though as he deserved, he was
afterward hanged for it. There was another
Praying <HI>Indian</HI> so wicked and cruel, as to wear
a String about his Neck, strung with <HI>Christian</HI>
Fingers. Another Praying <HI>Indian,</HI> when they
went to <HI>Sudbury</HI> Fight, went with them, and his
Squaw also with him, with her Papoos at her
<PB N="58" REF="002173_0058_0F52A9E0A7896A08">
back: Before they went to that Fight, they got
a company together to <HI>Powaw:</HI> The manner
was as followeth.</P>
<P>There was one that kneeled upon a <HI>Deer-Skin,</HI>
with the Company round him in a Ring,
who kneeled, striking upon the Ground with
their Hands, and with Sticks, and muttering or
humming with their Mouths. Besides him who
kneeled in the Ring, there also stood one with
a Gun in his hand: Then he on the <HI>Deer-Skin</HI>
made a Speech, and all manifested Assent to it,
and so they did many times together. Then
they bid him with the Gun go out of the Ring,
which he did; but when he was out, they call|ed
him in again; but he seemed to make a
stand: Then they called the more earnestly,
till he returned again. Then they all sang. Then
they gave him two Guns, in either Hand one.
And so he on the <HI>Deer-Skin</HI> began again; and
at the end of every Sentence in his speaking,
they all assented, humming or muttering with
their Mouths, and striking upon the Ground
with their Hands. Then they bid him with the
two Guns, go out of the Ring again; which he
did a little way. Then they called him in again,
but he made a stand, so they called him with
greater earnestness: But he stood reeling and
wavering, as if he knew not whether he should
stand or fall, or which way to go. Then they
called him with exceeding great Vehemency,
<PB N="59" REF="002173_0059_0F52A9E179A7B078">
all of them, one and another. After a little
while he turned in, staggering as he went, with
his Arms stretched out, in either Hand a Gun.
As soon as he came in, they all sang and rejoyc|ed
exceedingly a while, and then he upon the
<HI>Deer-Skin</HI> made another Speech, unto which
they all assented in a rejoycing manner; and so
they ended their Business, and forthwith went
to <HI>Sudbury</HI> Fight.</P>
<P>To my thinking, they went without any
scruple but that they should prosper, and gain
the Victory. And they went out not so rejoyc|ing,
but they came home with as great a Victo|ry.
For they said they had killed two Captains,
and almost an hundred Men. One <HI>English</HI> Man
they brought alive with them, and he said it
was too true, for they had made sad work at
<HI>Sudbury;</HI> as indeed it proved. Yet they came
home without that Rejoycing and Triumphing
over their Victory, which they were wont to
shew at other times: But rather like Dogs, (as
they say) which have lost their Ears. Yet I
could not perceive that it was for their own
loss of Men; they said they lost not above five
or six; and I missed none, except in one <HI>Wig|wam.</HI>
When they went, they acted as if the
Devil had told them that they should gain the
Victory; and now they acted as if the Devil
had told them that they should have a Fall.
Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so
<PB N="60" REF="002173_0060_0F52A9E1F6E31238">
it proved: For quickly they began to fall, and
so held on that Summer, till they came to utter
Ruine. They came home on a Sabbath day,
and the <HI>Powaw</HI> that kneeled upon the <HI>Deer-Skin,</HI>
came home (I may say without any abuse)
as black as the Devil. When my Master came
home, he came to me, and bid me make a Shirt
for his Papoos of a Holland laced Pillow-beer.
About that time there came an <HI>Indian</HI> to me,
and bid me come to his Wigwam at Night, and
he would give me some Pork and Ground-Nuts.
Which I did, and as I was eating, ano|ther
<HI>Indian</HI> said to me, He seems to be your
good Friend, but he killed two <HI>English</HI> Men at
<HI>Sudbury,</HI> and there lye their Cloaths behind you;
I looked behind me, and there I saw bloody
Cloaths, with bullet-holes in them; yet the
Lord suffered not this wretch to do me any
hurt. Yea, instead of that, he many times re|fresht
me: five or six times did he &amp; his <HI>Squaw</HI>
refresh my feeble Carcass. If I went to their
Wigwam at any time, they would always give
me something, and yet they were Strangers
that I never saw before. Another Squaw gave
me a piece of fresh Pork, and a little Salt with
it, and lent me her Frying-pan to fry it; and
I cannot but remember what a sweet, pleasant
and delightful Relish that bit had to me, to this
day. So little do we prize common Mercies,
when we have them to the full.</P></DIV2>

many of their ill doings, for this <HI>Indian,</HI> her

began now to come from all Quarters, against
their merry dancing Day: Amongst some of
them came one Good-wife <HI>Kettle:</HI> I told her my
Heart was so heavy that it was ready to break:
So is mine too, said she, but yet I hope we shall
hear some good <HI>News</HI> shortly. I could hear how
<PB N="62" REF="002173_0062_0F52A9E3842BC790">
earnestly my Sister desired to see me, and I ear|nestly
desired to see her; yet neither of us could
get an opportunity. My Daughter was now but
about a mile off; and I had not seen her in 9
or 10 Weeks, as I had not seen my Sister since
our first taking. I desired them to let me go and
see them, yea, I intreated, begged &amp; perswaded
them to let me see my Daughter; and yet so hard-hearted
were they, that they would not suffer it.
They made use of their tyrannical Power whilst
they had it, but through the Lord's wonderful
Mercy, their time was now but short.</P>
<P>On a Sabbath-day, the Sun being about an
hour high in the afternoon, came Mr. <HI>Iohn Hoar,</HI>
(the Council permitting him and his own for|ward
Spirit inclining him) together with the 2
forementioned <HI>Indians, Tom</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> with the
third Letter from the Council. When they came
near, I was abroad; they presently calle me in,
and bid me sit down, and not stir. Then they
catcht up their Guns and away they ran, as if
an enemy had been at hand, and the Guns went
off apace. I manifested some great trouble, and
they asked me what was the matter? I told them
I thought they had killed the <HI>English</HI> Man, (for
they had in the mean time told me that an <HI>En|glish</HI>
Man was come) they said no; they shot o|ver
his Horse, and under, and before his Horse;
and they pusht him this way and that way, at
their pleasure, shewing what they could do.
<PB N="63" REF="002173_0063_0F52A9E48BBD0528">
Then they let them come to their Wigwams. I
begged of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">m to let me see the <HI>English</HI> Man,
but they would not; but there was I fain to sit
their pleasure. When they had talked their fill
with him, they suffered me to go to him. We
asked each other of o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">r welfare, and how my
Husband did, and all my Friends? he told me
they were all well, and would be glad to see me.
Among other things which my Husband sent me,
there came a <HI>pound of Tobacco,</HI> which I sold for 9
<HI>Shillings</HI> in Money: For many of them for want
of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> smoked <HI>Hemlock</HI> &amp; <HI>Ground-Ivy.</HI> It was
a great mistake in any who thought I sent for
<HI>Tobacco,</HI> for through the favour of God, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">e|sire
was overcome. I now asked them, whither I
should go home with Mr. <HI>Hoar?</HI> they answered
no, one and another of them; and it being late,
we lay down with that Answer: In the Morning
Mr <HI>Hoar</HI> invited the <HI>Saggamores</HI> to Dinner; but
when we went to get it ready, we found they had
stolen the greatest part of the Provision Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI>
had brought. And we may see the wonderful
Power of God&punc; in that one passage, in that when
there was such a number of them together, and
so greedy of a little good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> Food, and no <HI>English</HI>
there but Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI> and my self, that there they
did not knock us on the head, and take what
we had; there being not only some Provision,
but also Trading-Cloth, a part of the 20 <HI>Pounds</HI>
agreed upon: But instead of doing us any Mis|Mischief,
<PB N="64" REF="002173_0064_0F52A9E4F67861B8">
they seemed to be ashamed of the fact,
and said it was <HI>Matchit Indians</HI> that did it. Oh
that we could believe that there is nothing too
hard for God! God shewed his Power over the
<HI>Heathen</HI> in this, as he did over the <HI>hungry Lions,</HI>
when <HI>Daniel</HI> was cast into the <HI>Den.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI> call|ed
them betime to Dinner, but they ate but lit|tle,
they being so busie in dressing themselves &amp;
getting ready for their <HI>Dance;</HI> which was carri|ed
on by 8 of them, 4 Men and 4 Squaws; my
Master and Mistress being two. He was dressed
in his Holland Shirt, with great Laces sewed at
the tail of it, he had his <HI>Silver Buttons,</HI> his white
Stockings, his Garters hung round with <HI>Shillings,</HI>
and had Girdles of <HI>Wampom</HI> upon his head and
shoulders. She had a <HI>Kersey Coat,</HI> covered with
Girdles of <HI>Wampom</HI> from the Loins upward. Her
Arms from her Elbows to her Hands, were co|vered
with <HI>Bracelets,</HI> there were hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">uls of <HI>Neck|laces</HI>
about her Neck, and several sorts of Jewels
in her Ears. She had fine <HI>red Stockings,</HI> and white
Shoes, her Hair powdered and her Face painted
Red, that was always before Black. And all the
<HI>Dancers</HI> were after the same manner. There were
two other singing &amp; knocking on a Kettle for
their Musick. They kept hopping up and down
one after another, with a Kettle of Water in the
midst, standing warm upon some <HI>Embers,</HI> to <HI>drink</HI>
of when they were dry. They held on till it was
almost Night, throwing out <HI>Wampom</HI> to the <HI>stan|ders-by.</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="002173_0065_0F52A9E5C09E7668">
At Night I asked them again, if I should
go home? they all as one said no, except my
Husband would come for me. When we were
lain down, my Master went out of the Wig|wam,
and by and by sent in an <HI>Indian,</HI> called
<HI>Iames the Printer,</HI> who told Mr. <HI>Hoar,</HI> that my
Master would let me go home to morrow, if he
would let him have one pint of <HI>Liquors.</HI> The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI> called his own <HI>Indians, Tom</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI>
and bid them all go, &amp; see if he would promise
it before them three; and if he would, he should
have it, which he did, and had it. <HI>Philip</HI> smell|ing
the business, called me to him, and asked me
what I would give him, to tell me some good
News, and to speak a good word for me, that I
might go home to morrow? I told him I could
not tell what to give him, I would any thing I
had, and asked him what he would have? He
said two Coats, and <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> in Money,
half a bushel of Seed Corn, and some Tobacco.
I thanked him for his love, but I knew that <HI>good
News</HI> as well as that crafty Fox. My Master af|ter
he had had his <HI>Drink,</HI> quickly came ranting
into the <HI>Wigwam</HI> again, and called for Mr. <HI>Hoar,</HI>
drinking to him, and saying he was a <HI>good Man,</HI>
and then again he would say, hang him Rogue.
Being almost Drunk, he would drink to him, &amp;
yet presently say he should be hanged. Then
he called for me,; I trembled to hear him, and
yet I was fain to go to him; and he drank to
<PB N="66" REF="002173_0066_0F52A9E687539088">
me, shewing no incivility. He was the first <HI>Indian</HI>
I saw Drunk, all the time I was among them.
At last his Squaw ran out, &amp; he after her, round
the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> with his Money jing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ing at his
knees, but she escaped him; but having an old
Squaw he ran to her; and so through the Lord's
Mercy, we were no more troubled with him that
Night. Yet I had not a comfortable Nights rest;
for I think I can say, I did not sleep for three
Nights together. The Night before the Letter
came from the Council, I could not rest, I was
so full of fears and troubles; yea, at this time I
could not rest Night nor Day. The next Night
I was over-joy'd, Mr. <HI>Hoar</HI> being come, and that
with such good Tidings. The third Night I was
even swallowed up with the thoughts of going
home again, and that I must leave my Children
behind me in the Wilderness; so that sleep was
now almost departed from mine eyes.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> Morning they called their <HI>General
Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"></HI> (as they stiled it) to consult and determine,
whether I should go home or no. And they all
seemingly consented that I should go, except
<HI>Philip,</HI> who would not come among them.</P>
<P>But before I go any farther, I would take
leave to mention a few remarkable Passages of
Providence, which I took special Notice of in
my afflicted time.</P>
<P>1. Of the fair opportunity lost in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> long
March, a little after the <HI>Fort-fight,</HI> when our <HI>En|glish</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="002173_0067_0F52A9E78C9C1E70">
Army was so numerous, and in pursuit of
the Enemy, and so near as to overtake several
and destroy them; and the Enemy in such di|stress
fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> Food, that our Men might track them
by their rooting in the Earth for Ground-Nuts,
whilst they were flying for their lives; I say that
then our Army should want Provision, and be for|ced
to leave their pursuit, &amp; return homeward,
and the very next week the enemy came upon
our Town, like <HI>Bears</HI> bereft of their <HI>Whelps,</HI> or so
many Ravenous Wolves, rending us and our
Lambs to Death. But what shall I say? God
seemed to leave his People to themselves, and
ordered all things for his own holy ends. <HI>Shall
there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not done
it? They are not grieved for the Affliction of Ioseph,
therefore they shall go Captive, with the first that go
Captive. It is the Lords doing, and it should be mar|vellous
in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>2. I cannot but remember, how the <HI>Indians</HI>
derided the slowness and dulness of the <HI>English</HI>
Army in its setting out. For after the desolations
at <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Medfield,</HI> as I went along with
them, they asked me when I thought the <HI>English</HI>
Army would come after them? I told them I could
not tell. It may be they may come in <HI>May,</HI> said they
Thus did they scoff at us, as if the <HI>English</HI>
would be a quarter of a Year getting ready.</P>
<P>3 Which also I have hinted before, when the
<HI>English</HI> Army with new Supplies were sent forth
<PB N="68" REF="002173_0068_0F52A9E820755F38">
to pursue after the Enemy, &amp; they understand|ing
it, fled before them till they came to <HI>Ba|quaug</HI>
River, where they forthwith went over
safely; that that River should be impassible to
the <HI>English.</HI> I can but admire to see the wonder|ful
Providence of God in preserving the <HI>Heathen</HI>
for farther Affliction to our poor Country.
They could go in great Numbers over, but the
<HI>English</HI> must stop: God had an over-ruling hand
in all those things.</P>
<P>4. It was thought, If their Corn were cut
down, they would starve and die with Hunger;
and all that could be found, was destroyed, and
they driven from that little they had in store, in|to
the Woods, in the midst of Winter; and yet
how to admiration did the Lord preserve them for
his holy ends, and the destruction of many still
among the <HI>English!</HI> strangely did the Lord pro|vide
for them, that I did not see (all the time
I was among them) one Man, Woman or Child
dye with Hunger. Though many times they
would eat that that a Hog or a Dog would
hardly touch; yet by that God strengthened
them to be a scourge to his People.</P>
<P>Their chief &amp; commonest food was Ground-Nuts;
they ate also Nuts, and Acrons, Harty-choaks,
Lilly-roots, Ground-beans, and several
other Weeds and Roots, that I know not.</P>
<P>They would pick up old Bones, and cut them
in pieces at the joynts, and if they were full of
<PB N="69" REF="002173_0069_0F52A9E92652CA80">
Worms &amp; Magots, they would scald them over
the fire, to m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ke the vermine come out, &amp; then
boyl them, and drink up the Liquor, and then
beat the great ends of them in a Morter, and so
eat them. They would eat Horses Guts, &amp; Ears,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> all sorts of wild Birds which they could
catch: Also Bear, Venson, Beavers, Tortois,
Frogs, Squirrils, Dogs, Skunks, Rattle-snakes:
Yea, the very Bark of Trees; besides all sorts
of Creatures, &amp; Provision which they plundered
from the <HI>English.</HI> I can but stand in admiration
to see the wonderful power of God, in providing
for such a vast number of our Enemies in the
Wilderness, where there was nothing to be seen,
but from hand to mouth. Many times in a morn|ing,
the generality of them, would eat up all
they had, and yet have some further supply a|gainst
they wanted. It is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 13, 14.
<HI>Oh that my people had hearkened to, me, and Israel
had walked in my ways; I should soon have subdued
their Enemies, and turned my hand against their ad|versaries.</HI>
But now our perverse and evil carri|ages
in the sight of the Lord, have so offended
him, that instead of turning his hand against
them, the Lord feeds and nourishes the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> up to
be a scourge to the whole Land.</P>
<P>5. Another thing that I would observe is, the
strange providence of God in turning things a|bout
when the <HI>Indians were at the highest, and the
English at the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">est.</HI> I was with the Enemy 11
<PB N="70" REF="002173_0070_0F52A9EA329E5020">
Weeks and 5 Days, and not one Week passed
without their fury, and some Desolation by <HI>Fire</HI>
and <HI>Sword</HI> upon one place or other. They mour|ned
for their own Losses, yet triumphed and re|joyced
in their inhumane and devilish Cruelty
to the <HI>English.</HI> They would boast much of their
Victories; saying, that in two hours time, they
had destroyed such a Captain, and his Compa|ny
in such a place; and such a Captain and his
Company in such a place: And boast how many
To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">s they had destroyed, and then scoff, and
say, <HI>They had done them a good turn, to send them
to Heaven so soon.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">gain, they would say, this
Summer they would knock all the Rogues on
the head, or drive them into the Sea, or make
them fly the Country; thinking surely, <HI>Agag</HI>|like,
<HI>The bitterness of Death is past.</HI> Now the <HI>Hea|then</HI>
begin to think all is their own; &amp; the poor
<HI>Christians</HI> hopes to fail, (as to man) and now their
Eyes are more to God, and their Hearts sigh
Heaven-ward, and to say in good earnest, <HI>Help
Lord, or we perish.</HI> When the Lord had brought
his people to this, that they saw no help in any
thing but himself, then he takes the Quarrel in|to
his own hand; and tho' they had made a pit
(in their own imaginations) as deep as <HI>Hell</HI> for
the <HI>Christians</HI> that Summer, yet the Lord hurl'd
themselves into it. And the Lord had not so
many ways before to preserve them, but now
he hath as many to destroy them.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002173_0071_0F52A9EA70CE4340">
But to return again to my going home; where
we may see a remarkable change of Providence:
At first they were all against it, except my Hus|band
would come for me; but afterward they
assented to it, and seemed to rejoyce in it: some
asking me to send them some Bread, others some
Tobacco, others shaking me by the hand, offer|ing
me a <HI>Hood and Scarfe</HI> to Ride in: not one
moving Hand or Tong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">e against it. Thus hath
the Lord answered my poor desires, &amp; the ma|ny
earnest Requests of others put up unto God
for me. In my Travels an <HI>Indian</HI> came to me,
and told me, if I were willing, he and his Squaw
would run away, and go home along with me.
I told them no; I was not willing to run away, <HI>but</HI>
desired to wait Gods time, that I might go home
quietly, and without fear. And now God hath
gran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ed me my desire. O the wonderful Power
of God that I have seen, &amp; the Experiences that
I have had: I have been in the midst of those
Roaring Lions, and Salvage Bears, that feared
neither God, nor Man, nor the Devil, by Night
and Day, alone and in company; sleeping all sorts
together, and yet not one of them ever offered
the least abuse of Unchastity to me, in Word or
Action. Though some are ready to say, I speak
it for my own Credit; but I speak it in the pre|sence
of God, and to his Glory. Gods Power is
as great now, as it was to save <HI>Daniel</HI> in the <HI>Li|ons
Den,</HI> or the three Children in the fiery Fur|nace.
<PB N="72" REF="002173_0072_0F52A9EAF9B0D068">
I may well say as he, <HI>Psal. 170. 12. Oh
give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, for his mer|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">y
endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of the Lord
say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the
Enemy:</HI> Especially that I should come away in
the midst of so many hundreds of Enemies, and
not a Dog move his Tongue. So I took my leave
of them, &amp; in coming along, my Heart melted
into <HI>Tears</HI> more than all the <HI>while</HI> I was with them,
&amp; I was almost swallowed up with the thoughts
that ever I should go home again. About the
Suns going down, Mr. <HI>Hoar,</HI> my self, and the
two <HI>Indians,</HI> came to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and a solemn
sight it was to me. There had I lived many com|fortable
Years among my Relations and Neigh|bours;
and now not one <HI>Christian</HI> to be seen,
nor one House left standing. We went on to a
Farm-house that was ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ding, where we lay
all Night; and a comfortable Lodging we had,
though nothing but Straw to lye on. The Lord
preserved us in safety that Night, &amp; raised us up
again in the Morning, and carried us along, that
before Noon we came to <HI>Concord.</HI> Now was I
full of joy, and yet not without sorrow: Joy, to
see such a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ly sight, so many <HI>Christians,</HI> toge|ther,
and some of them my Neighbours: There
I met with my Brother, and my Brother-in-law,
who asked me, if I knew where his Wife was?
poor heart! he had helped to bury her, &amp; knew
it not; she being shot down by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ouse, was
<PB N="73" REF="002173_0073_0F52A9EC45EA1D48">
partly burnt, so that those who were at <HI>Boston</HI>
at the Desolation of the Town, and came back
afterward and buried the Dead, did not know
her. Yet I was not without Sorrow, to think how
many were looking and longing, and my own
Children among the rest, to enjoy that Delive|rance
that I had now received; and I did not
know whither ever I should see them again. Be|ing
recruited with Food &amp; Raiment, we went to
<HI>Boston</HI> that Day; where I met with my dear Hus|band,
but the thoughts of our dear Children, one
being dead, &amp; the other we could not tell where,
abated our comfort each in other. I was not be|fore
so much hem'd in by the merciless &amp; cruel
<HI>Heathen,</HI> but now as much with pitiful, tender-hearted
and compassionate <HI>Christians.</HI> In that
poor and beggerly condition, I was received in,
I was kindly entertained in several Houses: So
much Love I received from several, (many of
whom I knew not) that I am not capable to
declare it. But the Lord knows them all by
name: The Lord reward them seven fold into
their Bosoms of his Spirituals, for their Tempo|rals.
The <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> the price of my Re|demption,
was raised by some <HI>Boston</HI> Gentlewo|men,
and M. <HI>Usher,</HI> whose Bounty and Charity,
I would not forget to make mention of. Then
Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard of Charlstown</HI> received us in|to
his House, where we continued 11 Weeks;
and a Father and Mother they were unto us.
<PB N="74" REF="002173_0074_0F52A9EC84104C68">
And many more tender-hearted Friends we met
with in that place. We were now in the midst
of Love, yet not without much and frequent
heaviness of Heart, for our poor Children, and
other Relations, who were still in Affliction.
The Week following, after my coming in, the
Governour and Council sent to the <HI>Indians</HI> again,
and that not without success; for they brought
in my Sister and good-wife <HI>Kettle.</HI> Their not
knowing where our Children were, was a sore
Trial to us still; and yet we were not without
secret hopes of seeing them again. That which
was dead lay&punc; heavier upon my Spirit, than those
which were alive among the <HI>Heathen;</HI> thinking
how it suffered with its Wounds, and I was not
able to relieve it; and how it was buried by the
<HI>Heathen</HI> in the Wilderness from among all <HI>Chri|stians.</HI>
We were hurried up and down in our
Thoughts, sometime we should hear a Report
that they were gone this <HI>way,</HI> and sometimes
that; and that they were come in, in this place
or that. We kept inquiring and listning to hear
concerning them, but no certain News as yet.
About this time the Council had ordered a Day
of publick <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> though I thought I had
still cause of Mourning; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">eing unset<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">led in
our Minds, we thought we would ride <HI>Eastward,</HI>
to see if we could hear any thing concerning
our C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ldren. As we were riding along between
<HI>Ipswich</HI> and <HI>Rowly,</HI> we met with <HI>William Hubbard,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="002173_0075_0F52A9ED55ACFB10">
who told us our Son <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and my Sisters Son,
were come in to Major <HI>Waldren</HI>'s: I asked him
how he knew it? he said the Major himself told
him so. So along we went till we came to <HI>New|bury;</HI>
and their Minister being absent, they de|sired
my Husband to Preach the <HI>Thanksgiving</HI>
for them; but he was not willing to stay there
that Night, but would go over to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> to
hear farther, and come again in the Morning,
which he did, and preached there that Day.
At Night, when he had done, one came and told
him that his Daughter was come in at <HI>Provi|dence:</HI>
Here was Mercy on both hands. Now
hath God fulfilled that precious Scripture, which
was such a comfort to me in my distressed condi|tion.
When my heart was ready to sink into the
Earth, and my knees trembling under me, and
I was <HI>walking through the valley of the shadow of
Death:</HI> Then the Lord brought, and has now
fulfilled that reviving Word unto me, <HI>Thus saith
the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thy
Eyes from Tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, saith
the Lord, and they shall come again from the Land
of the Enemy.</HI> Now we were between them, the
one on the <HI>East,</HI> and the other on the <HI>West;</HI> our
Son being nearest, we went to him first, to <HI>Ports|mouth,</HI>
where we met with him, and with the
Major also; who told us, he had done what he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ould, but could not redeem him under <HI>Seven
Pounds,</HI> which the good People thereabouts were
<PB N="76" REF="002173_0076_0F52A9EE01285B30">
pleased to pay. The Lord reward the Major, and
all the rest, tho' unknown to me, for their labour
of Love. My Sisters Son was redeemed for <HI>four
Pounds,</HI> which the Council gave order for the
payment of. Having now received one of our
Children, we hastned toward the other: Going
back through <HI>Newbury,</HI> my Husband pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ched
there on the Sabbath-day, for which they Re|warded
him manifold.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> we came to <HI>Charlstown,</HI> where we
heard that the Governour of <HI>Rhoad-Island</HI> had
sent over for our Daughter, to take care of her,
being now within his Jurisdiction; which
should not pass without our acknowledgements.
But she being nearer <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">oboth</HI> than <HI>Rhoad-Island,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Newman</HI> went over and took care of her, &amp;
brought her to his own House. And the good|ness
of God was admirable to us in our low
estate, in that he raised up passionate Friends on
every side, when we had nothing to recompence
any for their Love. The <HI>Indians</HI> were now gone
that way, that it was apprehended dangerous
to go to her; but the Carts which carried Pro|vision
to the <HI>English</HI> Army, being guarded,
brought her with them to <HI>Dorchester,</HI> where we
received her safe; blessed be the Lord for it, <HI>for
great is his Power, and he can do whatsoever seem|eth
him good.</HI> Her coming in was after this man|ner:
She was travelling one day with the <HI>Indians,</HI>
with her Basket at her back; the company of <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="002173_0077_0F52A9EECD5EC678">
were got before her, and gone out of fight,
all except one Squaw&punc; She followed the Squaw
till night, and then both of them lay down,
having nothing over them but the Heavens, nor
under them but the Earth. Thus she travelled 3
days together, having nothing to eat or drink
but Water and green <HI>Hirtle-berries.</HI> At last they
came into <HI>Providence,</HI> where she was kindly en|tertained
by several of that Town. The <HI>Indians</HI>
often said, that I should never have her under
<HI>twenty Pounds,</HI> but now the Lord hath brought
her in upon free-cost, and given her to me the
second time. The Lord make us a Blessing in|deed,
each to others. Now have I seen that <HI>Scrip|ture</HI>
also fulfilled, <HI>Deut. 30. 4, 7. If any of thine be
driven out to the utmost parts of Heaven, from thence
will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence
will I fetch thee. And the Lord thy God will put all
these Curses upon thine enemies, and on them which
hate thee, which persecuted thee.</HI> Thus hath the
Lord brought me and mine out of that horrible
pit, &amp; hath set us in the midst of tender-hearted
and compassionate Christians. 'Tis the desire of
my Soul, that we may walk worthy of the mer|cies
received, and which we are receiving.</P>
<P>Our Family being now gathered together, the
<HI>South</HI> Church in <HI>Boston</HI> hired an House for us:
Then we removed from Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI>'s (those
cordial Friends) and went to <HI>Boston,</HI> where we
continued about three quarters of a Year. Still
<PB N="78" REF="002173_0078_0F52A9EF7B0F1078">
the Lord went along with us, and provided
graciously for us. I thought it somewhat strange
to set up House-keeping with bare Walls, but as
<HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>Money answers all things:</HI> And that
we had through the Benevolence of <HI>Christian</HI>
Friends, some in this Town, and some in that,
and others; and some from <HI>England,</HI> that in a
little time we might look and see the House
furnished with Love. The Lord hath been ex|ceeding
good to us in our low estate, in that
when we had neither house nor home, nor other
necessaries, the Lord so moved the Hearts of
these and those towards us, that that we want|ed
neither Food nor Raiment for our selves or
ours, Prov. 18. 24. <HI>There is a Friend that sticketh
closer than a Brother.</HI> And how many such Friends
have we found, and now living amongst! and
truly such a Friend have we found him to be
unto us, in whose House we lived, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr.
<HI>Iames Whitcomb,</HI> a Friend near hand, and afar of.</P>
<P>I can remember the time, when I used to sleep
quietly without workings in my thoughts, whole
Nights together; but now it is otherwise with
me. When all are fast about me, and no eye o|pen,
but his who ever waketh, my thoughts are
upon things past, upon the awful dispensations
of the Lord towards us; upon his wonderful
power and might in carrying of us through so
many difficulties, in returning us in safety, and
suffering none to hurt us. I remember in the
<PB N="79" REF="002173_0079_0F52A9F066A09490">
night season, how the other day I was in the
midst of thousands of enemies, and nothing but
Death before me: It was then hard work to per|swade
my self, that ever I should be satisfied
with Bread again. But now we are fed with the
finest of the <HI>Wheat,</HI> and (as I may say) with <HI>Honey
out of the Rock:</HI> Instead of the <HI>Husks,</HI> we had the
<HI>Fatted Calf:</HI> The thoughts of these things in the
particulars of them, and of the love and good|ness
of God&punc; towards us, make it true of me,
what <HI>David</HI> said of himself, <HI>Psal. 6. 6. I water
my Couch with my Tears.</HI> Oh the wonderful power
of God that mine eyes have seen, affording mat|ter
enough for my thoughts to run in, that when
others are sleeping mine eyes are weeping.</P>
<P>I have seen the extream vanity of this World:
One hour I have been in Health, and Wealth,
wanting nothing, but the next hour in Sickness,
and Wounds, and Death, having nothing but
Sorrow and Affliction. Before I knew what
Affliction meant, I was ready sometimes to wish
for it. When I lived in prosperity, having the
comforts of this World about me, my Relations
by me, and my Heart chearful, and taking little
care for any thing; and yet seeing many (whom
I preferred before my self) under many Trials
and Afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty,
losses, crosses, and cares of the World, I should
be sometimes jealous lest I should have my por|tion
in this Life; and that Scripture would come
<PB N="80" REF="002173_0080_0F52A9F16C0276D8">
to my mind, <HI>Heb. 12. 6 For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he re|ceiveth.</HI>
But now I see the Lord had his time to
scourge and chasten me. The portion of some is
to have their Affliction by drops, but the <HI>Wine of
astonishm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nt,</HI> like a <HI>sweeping Rain, that leaveth no
Food,</HI> did the Lord prepare to be my portion.
Affliction I wanted, and Affliction I had, full
measure, pressed down and running over: Yet I
see when God calls a person to never so many
Difficulties, yet he is able to carry them through,
&amp; make them say, they have been gainers there|by.
And I hope I can say in some measure, as
<HI>David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</HI> The
Lord hath shewed me the vanity of these out|ward
things; that they are the <HI>Vanity of vanities,
and vexation of Spirit:</HI> That they are but a sha|dow,
a blast, a bubble, and things of no conti|nuance.
If trouble from smaller matters begin
to arise in me, I have something at hand to
check my self with, and say, Why am I trou|bled?
It was but the other day, that if I had
had the World, I would have given it for my
Freedom, or to have been a Servant to a <HI>Chri|stian.</HI>
I have learned to look beyond present
and smaller Troubles, and to be quieted under
them, as <HI>Moses</HI> said, <HI>Exod. 14. 13. Stand still, and
see the Salvation of the Lord.</HI></P>
