<EPIGRAPH><BIBL>ZECHARIAH viii. 10, 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire
for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out,
or came in, because of the affliction: for I set all men every
one against his neighbour. But now I will not be unto the
residue of this people as in the former days, saith the <HI>LORD</HI>
of hosts. For the seed shall be prosperous: the vine shall give
her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the
heavens shall give their dew: and I will cause the remnant
of this people to possess all these things.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is remarkable, that after <HI>Israel</HI> had conquered
all their enemies, and taken possession of the land pro|mised
unto their fathers, they were very near break|ing
out into a civil war among themselves, and no
sooner were they freed of any apprehension from pow|erful
and troublesome neighbours, but the spirit of
discord had well nigh succeeded in transferring the seat of war in|to
their own bowels. We have an account of this important event
in the 22d chapter of the book of <HI>Ioshua,</HI> and the sum of it amounts
<PB N="4" REF="010531_0003_0F80375CCFE780B0">
to this. The tribes of <HI>Reuben, Gad,</HI> and half the tribe of <HI>Manasseh,</HI>
being settled on one, and all the rest of the tribes on the other side of
the waters of <HI>Iordan,</HI> the former thought it necessary to erect an al|tar
on the borders of their frontier, thereby to testify that tho' <HI>Ior|dan</HI>
was their boundary, yet they were the same people, united by
the same ties, natural, religious and political, and that they meant
by this altar to incultate and impress with these sentiments the minds
of their latest posterity. The rest of the nation however took the
alarm at their proceedings, looked upon this as a step towards inde|pendency,
and separation from the rest of their brethren; and as they
considered the matter in this view, it could not appear otherwise to
them but exceeding alarming. Accordingly we are told, when the
children of <HI>Israel</HI> heard of it, the whole congregation gathered them|selves
to go up to war against them; <HI>Ios.</HI> xxii. 12. their minds were
thoroughly inflamed, and every thing ready for blood and slaughter.
Among all this enraged multitude, it seems there were yet some men
of moderation, and their lenient and healing counsels were the saving
of the people. These tribes were but lately returned from acting the
part of faithful auxiliaries to their brethren; it was not at all pro|bable
that those meant to separate their interests from that of the
whole stock, who had given such signal proofs of their attachment
to the rest; before things are carried to the last extremity, a solemn
message is sent to the suspected tribes, and when they came rightly
to understand one another, the fidelity of the three distinct tribes
fully appeared, and, instead of looking upon them as offenders, we
are told their answer pleased those sent among them, <HI>And</HI> Phinehas
<HI>the son of</HI> Eleazar <HI>the priest said unto the children of</HI> Reuben, <HI>and to the
children of</HI> Gad, <HI>and to the children of</HI> Manasseh. <HI>This day we perceive
that the</HI> LORD <HI>is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass
against the</HI> LORD: <HI>now ye have delivered the children of</HI> Israel <HI>out of the
hand of the</HI> LORD. <HI>And</HI> Phinehas <HI>the son of</HI> Eleazar <HI>the priest, and
the princes, returned from the children of</HI> Reuben, <HI>and from the children
of</HI> Gad, <HI>out of the land of</HI> Gilead, <HI>unto the land of</HI> Canaan, <HI>to the chil|dren
<PB N="5" REF="010531_0004_0F80375D93904530" MS="y">
of</HI> Israel, <HI>and brought them word again. And the thing pleased the
children of</HI> Israel; <HI>nnd the children of</HI> Israel <HI>blessed</HI> GOD, <HI>and did not
intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the
children of</HI> Reuben <HI>and</HI> Gad dwelt; Jos. xxii. 31, 32, 33. The spark
which had like to kindle so great a fire was seasonably extinguished,
a good understanding and mutual harmony restored, every man re|turned
to his home and lived quietly under his vine and fig-tree, in
the land which GOD had so lately given unto them.</P>
<P>Methinks whoever peruses this account with attention, may per|ceive
some parallel-between the case of <HI>Israel</HI> and what was lately our
own. You all know that for some time past the situation between
us and our brethren on the other side of the water has been exceeding
alarming. Complaints ran high, and it was even talked of that the
ten tribes intended to go to war against their brethren, and that not|withstanding
during a very late war these had given every possible
token of loyalty and attachment. An unhappy ill-advised act of the
<HI>British</HI> legislature laid the foundation of our griefs, and it seemed as
tho' the continuance of that act, and an universal alienation of minds,
must go hand in hand, the consequences of which might easily be
foreseen; they are not to be expressed, because they cannot be thought
of without horror.</P>
<P>There were not wanting in <HI>Britain,</HI> nor yet in <HI>America,</HI> some of
the descendants of the young counsellors of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> who would
have convinced us of the justice of that act by deadly arguments, and
would not have been unwilling to see <HI>America</HI> ruled with a r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">ot
iron, but blessed be GOD who defeated their counsels, who placed a
king on the <HI>British</HI> throne as tender of the liberty of the subject as
jealous of the glory of his own government; blessed be GOD in
whose hands are the hearts of all men, that he inclined the <HI>Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">sh</HI> so
parliament to hear the cries of the innocent, and, by a just, noble,
and generous repeal of that ill-concerted measure, to dissipate our
<PB N="6" REF="010531_0005_0F80375E49081688">
fears, remove our difficulties, restore our confidence, to give us a
pleasing opportunity to offer our public thanks unto <HI>Britain</HI>'s GOD,
and, like on the jubilee of old, to proclaim liberty throughout all
the land to all the inhabitants thereof.</P>
<P>I do not know any event ever happened to <HI>British America</HI> more
deserving of a public day of thanksgiving throughout all that wide
extended empire, and I would in the most serious manner call upon
my congregation to offer thanks unto the Most High, because he
has been favourable unto our land, and also to make a proper return
to our most gracious king, and the <HI>British</HI> legislature, for the remov|ing
of our shoulders from the burden, and delivering our hands from
the pots: <HI>My heart is toward the governors of</HI> Israel <HI>that offered them|selves
willingly among the people. Bless ye the</HI> LORD. <HI>They that were
delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water; there
shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the</HI> LORD, <HI>even the righteous
acts towards the inhabitants of his villages in</HI> Israel: <HI>then shall the people
of the</HI> LORD <HI>go down to the gates.</HI> Judges v. 9, 11.</P>
<P>The words which I have read unto you will afford us ample
matter for suita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">le meditation on this happy event; they are words
of GOD himself, and in their first intention are designed to put <HI>Israel</HI>
in mind of the pleasing ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">nge of their public affairs from the time
they had begun to lay the foundation of the temple: Before that
time we are told there was no hire for man nor beast, no peace in all
their border, and the hand of GOD against them to visit them with
severe afflictions; and after that GOD declares, that he will be no lon|ger
to them as in days past, that now they may expect every kind of
blessing, and that the remnant of the nation should henceforth possess
and enjoy all these things.</P>
<P>As these words are expressive of the gloomy state of the nation
before that period, and the pleasing prospect now offered, they will
want but very little accommodation to our present purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010531_0006_0F80375F1CE0C2E0">
My business therefore, under divine assistance will be to
<LIST>
<ITEM>Take some notice of the day of <HI>Iacob</HI>'s trouble, and the melan|choly
state of the remnant of <HI>Iudah</HI> while the hand of the
LORD was against them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>I would, in the next place, make a few remarks on the great
and precious promises given unto the penitent remnant of
the <HI>Iewish</HI> nation. And, lastly,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Endeavour to make some improvement on the whole, suitable
to the design of our present meeting.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>May I be enabled to speak on these things in a becoming manner,
and may we not dare to put GOD off with a little outward shew, or
the empty formality of this meeting, but may we offer up soul and
body unto our sovereign benefactor and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">eserver; may this be the
tribute of our gratitude and our reasonable service!</P>
<P>Mercies received appear the greater when they come after a long
and painful want; the return of the light is the more acceptable for
the preceding darkness; and so GOD here puts them in mind of the
distress under which they laboured till now, that the promise of peace
and plenty might be the more welcome. If we consider the words
in their full extent, they may lead us back to the state of the nation
at and during the invasion of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> and before <HI>Iudah</HI> was
carried into captivity; then indeed there was no hire for man nor
beast, no peace to him that came in nor went out: Besides the
scourge of war, <HI>Iadah</HI> also suffered by drought and famine: Judah
<HI>mourneth, and the gates thereof languish: they are black unto the ground;
because the ground was chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the
plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.</HI> Jer. xiv. 2, 4. All
this calamity increased in proportion as the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> got the
<PB N="8" REF="010531_0007_0F80376196F12F28">
country in their possession, and laid a close siege to the holy city, and
to their sanctuary. This mournful description was more than once
applicable to the land of <HI>Iudab,</HI> and it is mentioned as one of their
usual afflictions when they departed from GOD; <HI>In those times there
was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great
vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries,</HI> 2 Chron. xv. 5.
It is true indeed by this time the days of captivity were accomp|lished,
a number of them returned to the land of their fathers, but
even on their return their situation was still deplorable, and their dif|ficulties
exceeding great; <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was a heap of stones, and all the
country around a mere desolation; they met with opposition from
the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> and all their afflictions had not yet made them wise
enough to agree among themselves; their neglect also in building
the house of GOD had brought on them very severe judgments; they
looked for much and it came to little, and when they brought even
that little home GOD did blow upon it; when a man came to an heap
of twenty measures there were but ten, and when one came to the
wine press to draw out fifty vessels there were but twenty, and all this
because the house of the LORD lay waste, and every man ran to his
own house; <HI>Haggai</HI> i, 9. ii, 16. Such was their wretched state at
the time of this prophecy, and how wretched must a people be where
there is no hire for man nor beast, no peace in coming in and going
out, and where the judgments of GOD set every man against his
neighbour in the greatness of the affliction.</P>
<P>When there is no hire for man or beast, it is a plain sign that bu|siness
is at a stand, and every stagnation of this kind threatens the very
vitals of a country. This calamity falls heaviest upon the lower and
middling class of people, who make up the body, and the most use|ful
part of every nation. When the fields lie waste, the husbandman
mourneth, the necessaries of life are with difficulty procured by the
rich, and hunger and want seem unavoidable to the poor; sometimes
when the multitude of inhabitants is greater than the land can bear,
<PB N="9" REF="010531_0008_0F803762190C6E08" MS="y">
even the industrious cannot long find employ, and for want of that
are reduced to distress; sometimes when by war and other devasta|tions
countries are so drained that labourers are not to be had, a man
is more precious than fine gold, yea than the golden wedge of Ophir;
<HI>Isaiah</HI> xiii, 12. Though these cases be opposite yet the effect is the
same; neither does it affect those only who are more immediate suf|ferers;
the rich cannot live without the poor, and he that hires can|not
do without some one to hire. Trade may indeed supply the
wants of a nation, but trade is only an artificial supply; a country
that has room for the spreading of its inhabitants, and has ground for
tillage proportionable to their increase, must have greatly the advan|tage
over a mere trading nation; the former can find those resources
within itself for which the latter must be indebted to trade with its
colonies and other nations. The gains of trade may possibly be lar|ger
than those by cultivation, but a country well cultivated will al|ways
nourish and maintain its inhabitants, a country blessed with na|tural
advantages will easily procure the conveniencies and even super|fluities
of life, either within itself, or at least by the exports of its
natural produce; <HI>The profit of the earth is for all,</HI> even <HI>the king him|self
is served by the field;</HI> Eccles. v, 9. but when there is no hire
neither for man or beast, it is a sure sign that cultivation and trade
is languishing, and it is with bodies politic as it is with the natural
body, when once they begin to languish, if a remedy is not speedily
found out and adhibited, it must affect every part of the whole, and
the whole gradually fall into decay and consumption.</P>
<P>This was the case of a small remnant left in <HI>Canaan;</HI> they were on|ly
some of the meanest of the people, husbandmen and dressers of
vineyards, and it seems probable that even these were rather slaves
than subjects to the king of <HI>Babylon;</HI> hence they complain that they
are servants in their own land, <HI>Neh. ix, 36. Our inheritance is turned
to strangers, our houses to aliens. Our necks are under persecution: we
labour, and have no rest;</HI> Lam. v. 2, 5.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010531_0009_0F803762C6E2AA30">
During all these disasters, it was doubtless an additional and severe
affliction, <HI>that there was no peace to him that came in nor went out;</HI>
those that were already captives in <HI>Babylon</HI> could not with any safety
return into their own land, and they that were left in it, and fain
wanted to retire into <HI>Egypt,</HI> or any other place of security, could not
go out; and even among themselves there was no peace, no unani|mity,
but continual jarrings and discords. Some very remarkable
instances of the kind are mentioned in the forty-first chapter of <HI>Iere|miah;</HI>
even after their return all things were so unsettled, that not|withstanding
the hopeful appearance of their being once more resto|red
to their own land, there was no peaee to him that came in, nor
to him that went out; this was little better than war, and</P>
<P>War in its best light is a destruction of the human-species, but war
among brethren, intestine feuds and civil wars as they are called, of
the worst evil are the worst species; when the right hand is lifted up
against the left, when the members of the same body seek each other's
destruction, the whole body must needs feel, and if they continue, be
destroyed by it. And here I cannot but remember the address made
by some general to an <HI>Abyssinian</HI> monarch, who could imagine it
worth his while to go to war with his own subjects, in order to make
them submit to some religious rites and ceremonies, which he thought
himself in conscience bound to impose upon them, and which they
thought themselves in conscience bound to suffer any hardship rather
than submit unto; a battle was fought, the prince was victorious,
the field covered with the slain, when the general thus addressed the
conquering monarch, pointing at the heaps of the slaughtered;
<Q>These were your own subjects, and in every other cause willing to
shed their blood and lay down their lives for you&mdash;they were our
brethren, our own flesh and blood, and every victory of the kind
you gain over them is a step towards the entire ruin of your own
nation.</Q> Methinks the warrior that spoke so, spoke like a sen|sible
man and good patriot. The king gained the battle and gave up
<PB N="11" REF="010531_0010_0F8037668C04D010">
the point, wisely considering, that the gaining the affection of loyal
subjects would be a greater security to his reign and kingdom than
any submission he could force them unto by any act of mere power.</P>
<P>Union of minds and interests is the real strength of any nation, a
kingdom divided against itself cannot stand; <HI>Israel</HI> fell indeed by the
sword of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> but their own internal divisions gave the fi|nishing
stroke; the distress which they had brought upon themselves
was great exceedingly, the hand of the LORD was stretched out
against them, and the people returned not to him who did smite
them; their affliction, instead of humbling them before GOD, only
served to heighten their animosities against one another; their afflic|tion
is expressly mentioned as the cause of their disturbances, they
hated, mistrusted, supplanted one another, and therefore there was
no peace to him that came in, nor yet to him that went out.</P>
<P>There was no peace to him that came in, nor to him that went out,
<HI>because of the affliction.</HI> When people think they have nothing more
to hope, they are apt to conclude they have also nothing to fear.
When tyranny and oppression once arrive at a certain height, they be|come
intolerable even to loyalty, and must recoil upon their authors.
It is dangerous for sovereigns to make the experiment, how much
their subjects may be able and willing to bear. Oppression makes
even a wise man mad, and when any kingdom is all in confusion
within itself, when violence beareth rule, and the good of the com|munity
ceases to be the supreme law, when unreasonable burdens are
laid upon some to procure ease unto others, when jarring interests
and different factions divide the state and impose upon the sovereign,
such a nation not only ceases to be formidable to its neighbours and
enemies, but it is also in very great danger of falling into the condi|tion
within itself which is here described, no peace to him that goes
out, nor to him that comes in.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010531_0011_0F80376769E3D0E0">
Neither do all these things spring up out of the dust, or come upon
a people by chance, or in the common course of things: <HI>Shall there
be evil in the city, and the</HI> LORD <HI>hath not done it?</HI> Amos iii. 6. GOD
indeed <HI>is not the author of confusion but of peace,</HI> 1 Cor. xiv. 33. he
does not love iniquity but he also hateth oppression. Sometimes the
sins of the subject are punished by arbitrary sovereigns, and oppres|sion
and arbitrary power are sometimes visited (and overset too) by
the violence of unruly subjects.</P>
<P>There is a very remarkable instance of this in the reign of the son
of <HI>Salomon.</HI> He came to the throne by hereditary right, unhappily
for him he and his council probably thought that right indeseasible;
his father had made his yoke heavy upon the land, at his accession to
the throne, the subjects modestly represent their grievance, the sons
of violence reject the moderate request of the sons of just and decent
freedom, a tax, till then unheard of it would seem, is imposed, an
officer is sent to gather the odious tribute, but the officer, by the
verdict of all <HI>Israel,</HI> is stoned with stones, the king himself retires
with precipitation, a war is resolved on, one hundred fourscore
thousand men take up arms against <HI>Israel,</HI> and appear ready to fall
on; but the word of GOD came unto <HI>Shemaiah,</HI> the man of GOD,
saying, Speak unto <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> the son of <HI>Salomon</HI> king of <HI>Iudah,</HI> and
unto all the house of <HI>Iudah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and to the remnant of the
people, saying, Thus saith the LORD, ye shall not go up, nor fight
against your brethren the children of <HI>Israel;</HI> return every man to his
house, for this thing is of me, saith the LORD. And we are further
told, they hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and re|turned,
to depart according to the word of the LORD; thus the
shedding of blood was at that time prevented, and a stop put to a
cruel and intestine war by an immediate interposition of divine pro|vidence,
and that at the expence of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> who was never able to
bring back the ten tribes, but they continued a separate kingdom till
they fell into the hands of their common enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010531_0012_0F8037680A3F0FE8">
I do not mention all this to justify or approve in every respect the
conduct of the ten tribes, but to observe that if <HI>Reboboam</HI> had taken
the salutary advice of his old prudent counsellors, the defection and
ensuing division would not have happened. [1 <HI>Kings</HI> xii. <HI>throughout.</HI>]</P>
<P>GOD cannot delight in, bless, or approve any thing that is wicked:
<HI>Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished,</HI> Prov. xi,
21. Oppression and rebellion are both wicked, and may become by
a righteous judgment of GOD a scourge to one another. GOD abhors
sin and evil, but even sin and evil is not committed without his
knowledge and sufferance; he forms the light and creates darkness,
he makes peace and creates evil, he the LORD does all these hings;
<HI>Isaiab</HI> xlv. 7. His wisdom and justice in some cases may permit the
peace and tranquility of a sinful nation to be interrupted or taken
away, by suffering the rulers to be intoxicated with too high notions
of power, or by suffering the subjects to go beyond the just bounds,
in asserting and maintaining their just rights, and confusion and dis|orders
are the natural effects of all this, and it is as natural a conse|quence
that in those days there is no hire for man nor beast, no peace
to him that goes out nor comes in, and that every man is against his
neighbour on account of the affliction.</P>
<P>Thus far the gloomy part: let us next take notice of the pleasing
prospect that opens by the change of the scene and the divine pro|mise.</P>
<P>What GOD himself marks out as a very signal divine blessing, men
certainly should receive as a precious mark of his favour. To re|move
so great an affliction, and to change their mournful condition
into peace, plenty, and liberty, must be unto them an irresistible
proof that GOD was again returned unto them in mercy; and this in|deed
he assures them of in express words: <HI>I will not be unto the resi|due
of my people as in former days, saith the</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts; for the
<PB N="14" REF="010531_0013_0F803768CB107948">
seed shall be prosperous, the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall
give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew, and I will make
the remnant of my people to possess all these things.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a general promise that GOD would not deal with them as
he had of late. GOD changeth not neither in his nature or purposes;
there is no shadow with him of variableness or turning; but there is a
connection between man's carriage towards GOD and by the way of
GOD towards man: <HI>The Lord is with you, if ye be with him; and if ye
seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake
you;</HI> 2 Chron. xv. 2. With the pure he shews himself pure; and
in this sense it is said, that with the froward he will shew himself
froward; <HI>Psalm</HI> xviii. 26. National sins bring on national calami|ties,
and national reformation a national blessing; the same GOD that
threatens to pluck up, pull down, and destroy a rebellious king|dom,
will also turn from the evil he has threatened when they return
from the evil which they have committed; and that this was the
case at this time in <HI>Israel,</HI> appears plain from the prayers of <HI>Daniel,
Ezra, Nehemiah,</HI> and many others; while they continued rebellious,
the hand of the LORD should continue to be heavy upon them, but
now they returned unto GOD, he would return unto them in mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">y.</P>
<P>The labourer and husbandman should now be employed, the fields
should be cultivated, and in the land that lay desolate, and almost
uninhabited, in the land that was without man or beast, fields should
be bought again for money, and there should be hire for m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">n and
beast; <HI>Ierusalem</HI> should <HI>be inhabited as towns without walls, for the
multitude of men and cattle therein,</HI> Zech. ii. 4.</P>
<P>Their coming in and their going out should be in peace, he should
strengthen the bars of their gates, and give peace unto their b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">r|ders.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010531_0014_0F8037698BAEE7E0" MS="y">
<HI>They should no longer be a disunited nation, but unite like the
heart of one man;</HI> I will (<HI>saith GOD</HI>) give them one heart and one
way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them and of their
children after them, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxxii. 39.</P>
<P>Neither does GOD only promise a removal of those evils under
which in former days they groaned, but there is life also in his favour;
GOD in his very nature is kind unto all, and his tender mercies are
over all the works of his hands. Nothing but mercy would always
attend man, had not man turned away from the love of his maker.
Sin only makes a separation between us and our GOD, and when the
cause of his displeasure is removed, the streams of his kindness
follow their natural course, and flow down upon man. The order
and oeconomy of the whole creation speaks aloud the kind designs
of GOD to man; fury is not in him; punishing is his strange and the
doing-kindness is his natural work: Accordingly on their being
turned unto him, and he unto them, he promises them the very re|verse
of the evils under which they had hitherto laboured; plenty in|stead
of famine, the dew of heaven and rain in due season instead of
drought, and every kind of temporal prosperity and abundance in
the land to which they were now restored; the heavens should not be
of brass, nor the earth of iron; GOD would no longer forbid the
clouds to rain upon them, but he would hear the heavens, and they
should hear the earth, and the earth should hear corn, wine, and oil,
and these should hear <HI>Iezreel, Hosca</HI> ii, 21, 22. Neither should these
blessings be only transitory but durable, the days of their mourning
should be at an end, and the remnant of the nation now returned un|to
the LORD, and to his sanctuary should rejoice in the possession of
all these blessings; they should no longer hang up their harps by the
willows, but again sing the songs of <HI>Sion</HI> in their own land, and give
thanks unto the LORD, who had brought them again from the hea|then,
and turned their captivity like the streams in the south: <HI>O
LORD, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine an|ger
<PB N="16" REF="010531_0015_0F80376A4D8286D0">
is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. Cry out and shout, thou in|habitant
of</HI> Zion; <HI>for great is the holy one of</HI> Israel <HI>in the midst of thee;</HI>
Isaiah xii. 1, 6.</P>
<P>And this naturally leads me, which was the last thing proposed, to
endeavour an improvement of what has been said suitable to the de|sign
of our present meeting.</P>
<P>Some among us possibly may be ready to ask, what meaneth this
service, it is neither <HI>Sabbath</HI> nor new moon. To them I would ans|wer:
We are met to day to offer our thanks unto the great ruler of
all things, that he hath averted from us a very great evil, which in
part indeed was come upon us already, and which, considered as a
punishment of our sins, we but too justly deserve.</P>
<P>We are met to offer thanks unto GOD, that our invaluable privi|leges
are preserved, that our land is not become a land of slaves, nor
our fields a scene of blood. We are met to give thanks unto GOD,
that our gloomy apprehensions are removed, that the <HI>British</HI> parlia|ment
has seen the justice of our complaints, that our superiors, by
this act of justice and moderation, have shewn themselves superior to
themselves. We rejoice that affection and confidence is restored be|tween
us and our mother country. We are met to give thanks unto
the Most High, that, by the repeal of this act, there is hire again for
man and beast, that our ports are open, our trade unmolested, that
we may go to and fro in safety, that men are no more set every man
against his neighbour, that <HI>Manasseh</HI> is not against <HI>Ephraim,</HI> nor <HI>Eph|raim</HI>
against <HI>Manasseh;</HI> and we are also met to pray, that our poste|rity
may enjoy all these things, that mercy and truth may be the
blessing of our days, and of our whole nation, and that our civil and
religious liberties may be preserved inviolable till time shall be no
more.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010531_0016_0F80376B40A60FB8">
I suppose there are few or none hearing me that think we have not
now any particular cause to be thankful; if any should think so, I
should despair of convincing them that we really have; it is gene|rally
observed, that we best know to value our mercies from the
want of them, but I sincerely wish there may never be any conviction
of this kind in all the <HI>British</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>Come then, my friends, let us make mention of the mercies of
the LORD according to all his goodness, and according to the multi|tude
of his loving kindnesses which he has shewn unto the <HI>British</HI> na|tion.
Your own minds will too easily suggest unto you what must
have been our case if this unhappy act had not been repealed; and
should not our gratitude bear some proportion to the greatness of our
escape? Should we not thankfully review every circumstance that
brought about this pleasing event, and offer our humble and sincere
thanks to the kind providence of GOD, that gave success to the noble
and unwearied endeavours of our friends for that purpose? I think
the almost unanimous, steady, and prudent union of the <HI>Americans,</HI>
does honour to their present generation, and as it was very provi|dential,
and to many I suppose very unexpected, so I look upon it
as a real matter of gratitude. I would not be understood to vindicate
every thing that a confused multitude or a few individuals may have
done in a time of public confusion, but the manly, nervous, and
constitutional representations made by the representatives of the peo|ple,
may be looked upon as one of the means which providence has
made use of to set the justice of the <HI>American</HI> complaints in its true
light, and to excite us able and worthy friends to stand up as noble
champions for our cause. Had a whole people, who looked upon
themselves as oppressed and dealt with contrary to their natural pri|vileges,
been disregarded, there is no saying what might have been
the consequence; and the consequence must have been felt on each
side of the water; we must sink or swim together. That all our fears
have subsided, that all this jealousy has been removed, that the dark
<PB N="18" REF="010531_0017_0F80376BC72CDE48">
night which seemed to hang over our heads is turned into the light
of a hopeful morning, surely calls for our loudest and sincerest thanks|giving:
Offer therefore unto GOD thanks, give unto the LORD glory
and strength, let those that cried unto the LORD in trouble, and he
saved them out of their distresses, give thanks unto his name. <HI>He
brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death, and brake their
bands in sunder. Oh, that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</HI> Psalm cvii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>And, in the next place, let our thanks be given to our great and
good King, the friend of mankind, and the father of his people. He
glories to reign in the hearts of his subjects; and no king can have a
better title to the hearts of those over whom he rules. If it is <HI>a plea|sure
to him</HI> to repeal an act that gives pain unto his subjects, may all
his servants copy after him, and act worthy of the principles of so
great a king, and so good a master; and may every possible demon|stration
of loyalty and affection be ever paid him by all, but especially
by his <HI>American</HI> subjects. The <HI>Americans,</HI> who, I believe I may
justly say, to a man, have been friends to the succession in his illus|trious
house, if possible, must now shew a still greater degree of at|tachment
in return for this royal condescension and favour.</P>
<P>Bless, O GOD, the king; long let the crown flourish on his
head. Give him the desires of his soul; may he ever be a
king after thine own heart; give him wise counsellors and
faithful subjects; let his reign be long, peaceable, and glo|rious;
may the wicked never stand before his throne, and so
his throne be ever established in righteousness; and may our
posterity in some distant generation pay him the mournful
tear, when he is taken up into a kingdom that cannot be
shaken.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010531_0018_0F80376C8C0EE230">
Let me further beseech you, my hearers, to remember the rock
from which you were hewn; by descent or incorporation we are now
all <HI>Britons;</HI> let <HI>Britain</HI>'s interests be ever dear to us all. Pray for
the prosperity of the nation, for in her prosperity you shall prosper.
We have seen our mother-country act the part of a tender parent;
let us never fail to act the part of truly dutiful children. May <HI>Bri|tons</HI>
have a love for one another which many waters cannot quench.
May eastern and western <HI>Britons</HI> ever be more firmly united than <HI>Io|seph</HI>
and <HI>Ephraim,</HI> which were made like one stick in the hands of
the prophet. If GOD abhors him who soweth discord among bre|thren,
let us abhor them who would do any thing that might tend to|wards
a separation of interests or an alienation of affections. Let <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
and <HI>British America</HI> ever be like one heart and one soul; he that
would divide, <HI>anathema<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">sit,</HI> let him be held accursed by both.</P>
<P>It is a remark of the wisest king, <HI>Evil men understand not judgment,
but they that fear the LORD understand</HI> [take notice of, observe, and
improve] <HI>all things,</HI> Prov. xxviii. 5. Let us remember then, and let
our posterity know it, that if a prudent, proper remonstrance had
not been made and received, the year 1765 must have been the fatal
year from which the loss of <HI>American</HI> liberty must have been dated.
Let us also remember, that the year following was remarkable for
the repeal of an act that gave so universal uneasiness, and had like to
be so destructive to <HI>Britain</HI> on each side of the great waters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stamp Act was to have taken place Nov. 1, 1765, and it took place in all provinces <HI>conquered</HI> from the French and Spaniards in the last war, also in most of the islands, the military government of Nova-Scotia; and in Georgia stamps were for shipping only. The said act was repealed in the house of commons by a majority of 108, and a majority of 34 in the house of Lords; and the repealing act received the royal assent March 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="blotted">, 1766.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010531_0019_0F80376E82415CB0">
If we record these remarkable interesting events, it may not be im|proper
to subjoin: Fear GOD, honour the king, stand fast in your
liberty, and be not entangled with the yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>Let us forgive our enemies and honour our friends, the more so
because some of them (which is a pleasing honourable circumstance)
have at all times signally distinguished themselves in the cause of li|berty,
and deserved greatly of the <HI>British</HI> nation. Let every injury
received be written in sand, and all kindness be preserved in marble,
and every friend of liberty and his country be held in everlasting re|membrance.</P>
<P>The design of the repeal was to remove inconveniencies and con|sequences
detrimental to the <HI>British</HI> kingdoms; let us then do nothing
which might continue those inconveniencies which that wise and sa|lutary
act means to prevent.</P>
<P>Especially let us never give any handle to any to call in question
our loyalty to the king, and our sincere and firm attachment to our
mother country; let us ever be zealous for its prosperity, and pro|mote
it to the utmost of our power; let each one of us say upon this
occasion: <HI>Pray for the peace of</HI> Britain; <HI>they shall prosper that love
thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For
my brethren and companions sakes I will now say, Peace</HI> unto <HI>thee. Be|cause
of the house of the LORD our GOD I will seek thy good;</HI> Psalm
cxxii. 6, 7, 8, 9. Let us pay a chearful obedience to the laws of the
realm, and on all occasions approve ourselves worthy subjects of the
best of kings. Let us always return a filial respect to the indulgence
and tenderness of an affectionate parent. Let us convince even those
who have taken upon them to vilify and misrepresent the <HI>Americans</HI>
how greatly they have been mistaken, and how very unjust have been
their inflammatory reflections. Let the mean tools of faction be put
to shame, (if they are capable of that) by a conduct the very reverse
<PB N="21" REF="010531_0020_0F80376EFAA45828">
of that which they would have laid to our charge. Let us by well-doing
put to silence the ignorance or malice of foolish or wicked men.
Let every distinction of names and parties, every national prejudice,
be buried in everlasting oblivion. Let the good man whoever he be,
be the object of universal love and esteem, and the bad man the only
object of aversion and abhorrence. Let there be no other emulation
but who shall best promote the good of the whole. Render to every
one his due, tribute to whom tribute, custom to whom custom, fear
to whom fear, honour to whom honour. <HI>Submit yourselves to every
ordinance of man for the LORD's sake, whether it be to the king as su|preme;
or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the pu|nishment
of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well: As free,
and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants
of</HI> GOD; 1 Peter ii. 13, 14, 16. There is a very essential difference
between liberty and licentiousness, and it is highly criminal under pre|tence
of the one to indulge the other. If any excess of this kind has
been committed, may it be sincerely repented of, and carefully avoided
for the future, <HI>so speak and so act as they that shall be judged by the law
of liberty,</HI> James ii. 13.</P>
<P>ABOVE ALL, let us ever remember, that <HI>righteousness exalteth
a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people,</HI> Prov. xiv. 34. Our tem|poral
happiness cannot be more surely promoted, nor our civil and
religious liberties be better secured, than by a life suitable to the dig|nity
of our christian profession. Christianity is a benevolent institu|tion,
that bears a friendly aspect to civil government, and does not
in the least diminish the natural or civil rights of the subject. It
teaches superiors to rule in the fear of GOD, and to look upon their
subjects as their fellow creatures and brethren, whose happiness to
promote is the very design of their office; it engages subjects to
obey for the LORD's sake, not only to the gentle bus also to the fro|ward.
We cannot be good christians unless we are also good sub|jects
and good members of the community; let every one then de|part
<PB N="22" REF="010531_0021_0F80376F868DDB40">
from iniquity that is named after <HI>Christ.</HI> By promoting our
eternal we also shall secure our temporal welfare; nothing that has a
tendency to make us unhappy hereafter can have any tendency to
make us happy here. If ever (which GOD forbid) we should be
cursed with a tyrannical oppressive government, our sins must be the
cause of it. O! let us not sin away our mercies, neither let us sin
any more lest something worse befal us. We can never be said to be
free while we are the servants of sin, neither can any bondage equal
that of being led captive by <HI>Satan</HI> according to his will; and yet this
is the case of every graceless sinner, <HI>While they promise</HI> them <HI>liberty,
they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is
overcome, of the same is he brought into bondage,</HI> 2 Peter ii. 19. How
insignificant will our struggle for liberty appear, while we deliberately
give up ourselves to be slaves unto lust; if we abhor bondage, O! let
us at least take care that our bondage may not be eternal; chains of
eternal darkness are the portion of every impenitent sinner; and
<HI>Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves to obey, his servants ye are
to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righte|ousness?</HI>
Rom. vi. 16. When will the poor captive begin to feel his
fetters and groan for liberty? Where the spirit of the LORD is there
is liberty, and where the spirit of the world and sin reigns there is
slavery and bondage. Every deliberate sin helps to rivet the chain,
and the longer vicious habits are indulged the more difficult it is to
shake off their dominion. Man was made free, but he also was made
good; the sinner has lost his original goodness, and liberty departed
from him, when he hearkened to the voice of the tempter; one can|not
be recovered without the other; if we will be truly free we must
become truly good; we must be renewed in the spirit of our mind,
and be created after GOD in righteousness and true holiness, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv.
24. This, my hearers, is the true idea of liberty, to be freed from
every hurtful constraint, and to be able to do all that tends to make
us truly happy, or else to be free indeed is neither more nor less than
to be heartily engaged for him whose service is perfect freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010531_0022_0F803772B5F6A6C8">
O! my hearers, with what pleasure did we lately receive the news
which makes the subject of our thanksgiving to-day, how did joy
sparkle in every countenance, how warmly did we shake hands and
congratulate one another upon the occasion; we seemed like people
that had been apprehensive of being shipwrecked and happily made
a harbour; we seemed almost like animals in the air pump to whom
breath and life is restored by the return of that element; never before
have I seen any news received with equal and so universal satisfactions,
and all that was right; there were reasons more than sufficient for
great fear, and when they subsided it was meet they should be suc|ceeded
by joy as great: But with what woeful coldness and indiffe|rence
have too many carried themselves towards the best news that
was ever sent from heaven upon earth; how little have we been af|fected
with the glad tidings of great joy, that unto us is a saviour
born. <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> himself came to preach deliverance to the captives,
to set at liberty them that were bruised, to preach the acceptable year
of the LORD; he was in bonds that he might break our chains, he
laid down his life as a ransom for those that were in bondage of <HI>Satan</HI>
and sin, he died that we might eternally live. Our king is also our
saviour, his subjects are the purchase of his blood, and he invites
stranger to come and kiss his scepter, with no other view but that he
may have the pleasure of making them eternally happy. Behold how
much he has loved us, and how shall we now escape if we neglect his
great salvation? How ungrateful are we to him, and how unjust to
ourselves, if we chuse to continue in that slavery which he has been
at such amazing pains to redeem us from.</P>
<P>Come then, my friends, let us embrace this opportunity and be|come
his real subjects; let us chearfully forsake the service of vanity
and sin, and unreservedly give ourselves up to the LORD that bought
us. How happy would it be, if from this pleasing event we might
also date our sincere and hearty endeavours at least, to become his
freemen, that, being delivered from the fear of our enemies, we might
<PB N="24" REF="010531_0023_0F803773A5927438">
serve him <HI>in holiness and righteousness all the days of our life,</HI> Luke i.
75. then, and not till then, shall we be a people really free and truly
happy; then will the son make us free, and we shall be free indeed;
then shall we have a most indisputable right to the glorious liberty of
the sons of GOD.</P>
<P>When shall the kingdom of <HI>Christ</HI> extend over all the earth, and
homage be paid him by those who sit now in darkness and in the
shadow of death? When shall his gentle reign be the bliss of every
nation, ignorance, slavery, and superstition, be altogether banished
from the earth, and the blessings of peace, liberty, and the gospel,
be scattered over the whole wide creation?</P>
<P>For these things, my brethren, let us pray, thy kingdom come,
and seeing we look for a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us by
faith and holiness be daily preparing for the same; there the wicked
cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.</P>
<P>Now to the King invisible, immortal, and eternal, to him who is
able to keep us, and to present us before GOD with exceeding great
joy, to the only wise GOD our saviour, be glory and majesty, do|minion
and power, both now and ever.</P>
