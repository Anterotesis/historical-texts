<HEAD>PREFACE, OR AN APOLOGY for writing the Life of PRAISE-GOD BAREBONE. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious Personage must be well known to those conver|sant in the English History. <HI>Rapin,</HI> speaking of the extraordi|nary Parliament called by Cromwell in 1653, says,
<Q>Amongst these Members was one <HI>Praise-God Barebone,</HI> a <HI>Leather-Seller,</HI> who in his Neighbourhood passed for a <HI>notable Speaker,</HI> be|cause he used to entertain them with long Harrangues upon the Times: From this Man the People in Derision called them the <HI>Barebone Parliament.</HI></Q></NOTE></HEAD>
<L>REVENGE, by nature, animates each breast,</L>
<L>As fierce in man, as in the savage beast:</L>
<L>Ev'n the vile reptile feels this passion strong;</L>
<L>The abject Worm resents injurious wrong.</L>
<L>Does not the Wasp, provok'd, dart forth his sting?</L>
<L>The patient Swan will sometimes arm his wing.</L>
<L>Nature's the same in All&mdash;What wretch so low</L>
<L>Not to rataliate, or resent a blow?</L>
<L>Why then must I <HI>alone</HI> to <HI>insult</HI> yield,</L>
<L>And use no arms but the <HI>defensive</HI> shield?</L>
<L>Shall coward Scandal dare to wound my name,</L>
<L>Publish dis-praise and privately defame?</L>
<L>And blast, by falsehood, what's my greatest good,</L>
<L>A reputation dearer than my blood?</L>
<L>Shall sons of <HI>Belial</HI> saucily presume,</L>
<L>While I must sit, like patience on a tomb?</L>
<L>No:&mdash;to <HI>rataliate</HI> is a <HI>nat'ral law</HI>;</L>
<L>Reason, in self-defence, the sword will draw.</L>
<L>Arms less offensive to the Bard belong;</L>
<L>The Pen alone must vindicate his wrong:</L>
<L>Thus, like the fretful Porcupine's, his quill,</L>
<L>Venom'd with gall, his vengeance must fulfil.</L>
<L>Revenge, like Honor, has some noble laws;</L>
<L>Arm me then, Satire, and maintain my cause.</L>

<L>Teach me, <HI>Erynnis,</HI> for you dwell</L>
<L>'Mongst many <HI>Roundheads</HI> sent to hell.</L>
<L>I ask not now your aid to sing</L>

<L>Nor yet the Regicides, old Lambert,</L>
<L>Cromwell, or Bradshaw, now all damn'd for</L>
<L>No solemn covenant of the kirk,</L>
<L>To make rebellion holy work;</L>
<L>Nor the committee's pious board,</L>
<L>Who robb'd the church to serve the Lord;</L>
<L>With eyes turn'd up, devour'd the land,</L>
<L>Then prais'd their God's all-bounteous hand:</L>
<L>Nor yet the downfal of the Rump,</L>
<L>Worn by long sessions to the stump:</L>
<L>Awhile we'll wave these lofty themes,</L>
<L>These cursed principles and schemes.</L>
<L>Suffice it now we draw a saint&punc;</L>

<L>With short blue cloak, and prudish band,</L>
<L>And warning hour-glass in his hand:</L>

<L>Of him <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">HUDIBRAS.</NOTE>, who fought for Bear defendant.</L>
<L>Yet for his race, it matters not</L>
<L>Of whom, or where he was begot;</L>
<L>Tho' Fame proclaims, by lower trump,</L>
<L>That he was issue of the rump.</L>
<L>Spawn'd in Fleet-ditch the Brat was found,</L>
<L>Wrapt in a smock, yet almost drown'd:</L>
<L>Thence Mother Kirk, like PHARAOH's daughter,</L>
<L>Sav'd him, by <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>By Proverb,</HI> viz. He that is born to be hanged will never be drowned.</NOTE> Proverb, from the water&punc;</L>
<L>But as it is the Tyburn fashion</L>
<L>Always to sing the education,</L>
<L>Tricks, principles, and pedigree,</L>
<L>Of such as grace the triple tree,</L>
<L>As well as dress of ev'ry Smart,</L>
<L>Who makes his exit from the cart;</L>
<L>So shall our Muse, in doggrel verse,</L>
<L>Her hero's history rehearse.</L>
<L>PRAISE-GOD, the Brat was called; a name,</L>
<L>Among fanaticks, of great fame:</L>
<L>So call'd, in mem'ry of the event,</L>
<L>When at his birth a B&mdash;was sent,</L>
<L>Which by a fost'ring Mother's help,</L>
<L>Might save and suckle the young whelp:</L>
<L>Thus when Rome's Founders sprawling lay,</L>
<L>Expos'd in woods, it chanc'd, that way</L>
<L>A prowling Wolf came passing by,</L>
<L>Which on the Bantlings cast an eye:</L>
<L>She paw'd, and lickt, and seem'd to hug</L>
<L>The Cubs, who hung about her dug:</L>
<L>Thus was the infant PRAISE-GOD nurs'd,</L>
<L>To head, in time, the League accurs'd.</L>
<L>Near to the place renown'd of old,</L>
<L>(The nurs'ry of many a scold)</L>
<L>Tradition says there was a den,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="010340_0005_0F7E80F272C377D8">Like that which CACUS skulk'd in, when</L>
<L>ALCIDES came to search the place,</L>
<L>Where he his cattle stol'n could trace,</L>
<L>Which, VIRGIL says, so stunk and smoak'd,</L>
<L>That HERCULES was almost choak'd.</L>
<L>This was the den design'd by fate</L>
<L>For <HI>Bare-bone lodge,</HI> call'd <HI>Billingsgate.</HI></L>
<L>Hither the Dam brought home her young,</L>
<L>And laid him on a bed of dung;</L>
<L>Having observ'd that Beggars suck,</L>
<L>Like roots, much nourishment from muck:</L>
<L>But she forgot that the infection</L>
<L>Of dunghill-steams would spoil complexion;</L>
<L>Wherefore, alas! her little Bumkin</L>
<L>Grew up in colour like a pumpkin.</L>
<L>Yet well he throve in strength and stature;</L>
<L>No sucking pig could well be fatter:</L>
<L>For, as old CHIRON fed ACHILLES</L>
<L>With lion's, and with bear-bone jellies,</L>
<L>So to young PRAISE-GOD oft was thrown</L>
<L>A bullock's pluck, or marrow-bone.</L>
<L>Hence he was big at six, or seven,</L>
<L>As other younkers at eleven;</L>
<L>And always prone to kick, and cuff,</L>
<L>Prov'd he was made of rumpish stuff.</L>
<L>Ere he was Ten, he wax'd so stout</L>
<L>That he would join in ev'ry rout,</L>
<L>Whene'er, to <HI>serve</HI> the <HI>holy cause,</HI></L>
<L>The Saints <HI>defy'd</HI> their <HI>country's laws.</HI></L>
<L>Such too his early zeal 'gainst vice,</L>
<L>Whoring, and drunkenness, and dice,</L>
<L>First Mob he was, whene'er a nest</L>
<L>Of Whores, or Gamesters was opprest.</L>
<L>Yet once he was so over good,</L>
<L>He'd like to have suffer'd in the bud;</L>
<L>For in the plunder of the stews,</L>
<L>He hardly could escape the noose.</L>
<L>Once he was taken in the lurch,</L>
<L>For breaking windows of the church,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="010340_0006_0F7E80F30F9E17B8">And sent to Durance; yet at th' age</L>
<L>Of scarce twelve years he broke the cage.</L>
<L>At length so head-strong he was grown,</L>
<L>So much the Terror of the Town,</L>
<L>That ev'n his Dam began to dread,</L>
<L>And tremble for his <HI>yellow</HI> head:</L>
<L>The Saints too fear'd his forward zeal</L>
<L>Might hurt the Cause of Common-weal&punc;</L>
<L>Therefore, to save their darling hope</L>
<L>From danger of th' impending rope,</L>
<L>Summons were issu'd thro' the Sect</L>
<L>For solemn <HI>Synod</HI> of th' <HI>Elect.</HI></L>

<L>Which MILTON sets before your view,</L>

<L>Such was this <HI>gloomy Meeting</HI>; sate</L>
<L>T' advise, propound, to weigh, debate.</L>
<L>How to secure from Hangman's claws,</L>
<L>The hop'd Messiah of their cause.</L>
<L>It would be tedious to report</L>
<L>The whole proceedings of the court;</L>
<L>In which each canting whining Knave,</L>
<L>Formal and slow, his sentence gave:</L>
<L>Long the debates tho' nothing worth;</L>
<L>At last the Mountain did bring forth:</L>
<L>This was, in short, the sage event,</L>
<L>'That PRAISE-GOD should with speed be sent</L>
<L>'Under the care of <HI>Titus Oates.</HI>'</L>
<L>With this decree, by way of notice;</L>
<L>'The Tutor must take care to teach</L>
<L>'His Pupil all the&mdash;abuse of speech;</L>
<L>'To hum, and haw, to whine, and cant,</L>
<L>'To sigh, or groan, to howl, or rant:'</L>
<L>But this was special in the charge,</L>
<L>'T' instruct him how to <HI>Lye at large,</HI></L>
<L>'And <HI>Swear,</HI> as <HI>Oates</HI> himself best knew,</L>
<L>'Whene'er a Plot was in their view.</L>
<L>'Further to teach him the grimace,</L>

<L>'To roll his eye-balls to the lid,</L>

<L>'In short, that system of deceit,</L>
<L>'Which forms the Puritan complete.'</L>
<L>Lastly 'twas hinted by the bye,</L>
<L>'That if young PRAISE-GOD shou'n't comply,</L>
<L>'Then, as a last resource, his Elder</L>

<L>For, said a <HI>Synodal,</HI> 'Forsooth!</L>

<L>'Why did he, Lord, prefer a Mare?</L>
<L>'Our Sisters are not cruel fair:</L>
<L>'Whence could th' impetuous zeal proceed?</L>
<L>'The Colt's tooth was not in his head:</L>
<L>'Th' event too plainly has reveal'd,</L>
<L>'Where all his passion was conceal'd,</L>
<L>'For since the lucky operation,</L>
<L>'He lately suffer'd of Castration,</L>

<L>'Hence, by our own experience wise,</L>
<L>'This Operation I advise,</L>

<L>'To break the Rampant to subjection.</L>

<L>'That, by obedience to my rules,</L>
<L>'He may become the head of Fools.'</L>
<L>Well did he argue, nor in vain,</L>
<L>There was no need of spur, or rein;</L>
<L>The crafty BARE-BONE found out soon,</L>
<L>That he was under charge of one,</L>
<L>Who only sought to teach him, what</L>
<L>With his own genius curried pat:</L>
<L>Therefore in all things he obey'd,</L>
<L>And soon was Master of his Trade.</L>

<L>Not to forego the Lust of Vice;</L>
<L>He made no boggle at the Feint,</L>
<L>To be a Dev'l, and seem a Saint.</L>
<L>Therefore, whene'er he meant to sin,</L>
<L>With formal pray'r he would begin:</L>
<L>If <HI>Whoring</HI> was the vice in hand,</L>
<L>Thus, for a pause, he'd make a stand;</L>
