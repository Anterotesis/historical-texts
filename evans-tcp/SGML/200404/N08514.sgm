From hence it will follow that our le|gislatures were <HI>compleat,</HI> and that the parliamentary au|thori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> cannot be extended over us without involving the greatest con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">radict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on: For if we are to be controu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by their parliament, our own will be useless. In short, I cannot be perswaded that the par|liament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> have any lawful right to make <HI>any laws whatsoever</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind us, because there can be no fountain from whence s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch right can fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w.

Many other acts of legis|lation may affect us as nearly as taking away our monies. There are many kinds of proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y as dear to us as our

money, and in which we may be greatly injured by al|lowing them a power in, or to direct about. Suppose the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> should undertake to prohibit us from walking in the streets and highways on certain saints days, or from being abroad after a certain time in the evening, or (to come nearer to the matter) to re|strain us from working up and manufacturing materials of our own growth, would not our liberty and property be as much affected by such regulations as by a tax act? It is the very spirit of the constitution that the King's subjects sh&aacute;ll not be governed by laws, in the making of which they had no share; and this principle is the great barrier against tyranny and oppression. If this bulwark be thrown down, nothing will remain to us but a dread|ful expectation of certain slavery. If any acts of the <HI>Bri|tish</HI> parliament are found suitable and commensurate to the nature of the country, they may be introduced, or adopted, by special acts of our own parliaments, which would be equivalent to making them anew; and without such introduction or adoption, our allowance of the va|lidity or force of <HI>any</HI> act of the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> parlia|ment in these dominions of the King, must and will ope|rate as a concession on our part, that our fellow subjects in another country can choose a set of men among them|selves, and impower them to make laws to bind us, as well in the mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of taxes as in every other case. It hath been fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly proved, and is a point not to be contro|verted, that in our constitution the having of property, especially a landed estate, entitles the subject to a share in government and framing of laws. The <HI>Americans</HI> have such property and estate, but are not, and never can be represented in the <HI>British</HI> parliament. It is therefore clear that that assembly cannot pass <HI>any</HI> laws to bind us, but that we must be governed by our own parliaments, in which we can be in person, or by representation.</P>
<P>BUT of late a new system of politics hath been adopted in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the <HI>common people</HI> there claim a sove|reignty over us although they be only fellow subjects. The more I consider the nature and tendency of this
<PB N="8" REF="010886_0007_0F86CC35910F66B0">
cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im, the more I tremble for the liberties of my country&punc; For although it hath been unanswerably proved that they have no more power over us than we have over them, yet relying on the powerful logic of guns and cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lery ware, they cease not to make laws injurious to us; and whenever we expostulate with them for so doing, all the return is a discharge of threats and menaces.</P>
<P>IT is now an established principle in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that we are subject to the <HI>people</HI> of that country, in the same manner as they are subject to the Crown. They express|ly call us their subjects. The language of every paultry scribler, even of those who pretend friendship for us in some things, is after this lordly stile, <HI>our colonies&mdash;our wes|tern dominions&mdash;our plantations&mdash;our islands&mdash;our subiects in America&mdash;our authority&mdash;our government</HI>&mdash;with many more of the like imperious expressions. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">range doctrine that we should be the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bjects of subjects, and liable to be controuled at their will! It is enough to break every mea|sure of patience, that fellow subjects should assume such power over us. They are so possessed with the vision of the plenitude of their power, that they call us rebels and traitors for denying their authority. If the King was an absolute monarch and ruled us according to his absolute will and pleasure, as some kings in <HI>Europe</HI> do their sub|jects, it would not be in any degree so humiliating and debasing, as to be governed by one part of the Kings sub|jects who are but equals. From every part of the con|duct of the administration, from the acts, votes, and reso|lutions of the parliament, and from all the political wri|tings in that country, and libels on <HI>America,</HI> this appears to be their claim, which I think may be said to be an in|vasion of the rights of the King, and an unwarrantable combination against the liberties of his subjects in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>LET us now attend a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle to the conduct of that coun|try towards us, and see if it be possible to doubt of their principles. In the 9th. of <HI>Anne,</HI> the post-office act was made, which is a tax act, and which annually draws great sums of money from us. It is true that such an establishment would have been of great use, but then the
<PB N="9" REF="010886_0008_0F86CC370EDE84C0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion ought to have been made among ourselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And it is a clear point to me that let it be ever so muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the advantage of this country, the parliament had no more right to interfere, than they have to form such an establishment in the electorate of <HI>Hanover,</HI> the King's <HI>German</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>THEY have prohibited us from purchasing any kind of goods or manufactures of <HI>Europe</HI> except from <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t-Britain,</HI> and from selling any of our own goods or ma|nufactures to foreigners, a few inconsiderable articles ex|cepted, under pain of confiscation of vessel and cargo, and other heavy penalties. If they were indeed our so|vereign lords and masters, as they pretend to be, such regulations would be in open violation of the laws of nature. But what adds to this grievance is, that in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trade between us they can set their own prices both on our and their commodities, which is in effect a tax, and of which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave availed themselves: And moreover, du|ties are laid on diver's enumerated articles on their im|port, for the express purpose of a revenue. They freely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive and grant away our monies without our consent, under the specious pretence of defending, protecting, and securing <HI>America,</HI> and for the charges of the administra|tion of justice here, when in fact, we are not indebted to them one farthing for any defence or protection from the first planting the country to this moment, but on the contrary, a balance is due to us for our exertions in the general cause; and besides, the advantages which have accrued to them in their trade with us hath put millions in their pockets. As to the administration of justice, no country in the world can boast of a purer one than this, the charges of which have been always chearfully pro|vided for and paid without their interposition. There is reason to fear that if the <HI>British</HI> people undertake the business of the administration of justice amongst us it will be wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se for us, as it may cause an introduction of their fashionable corruptions, whereby our pure streams of jus|tice will be tainted and polluted. But in truth, by the administration of justice is meant the keeping up an idle

fett of officers to rob us of our money, to keep us down and humble, and to frighten us out of our undoubted rights.</P>
<P>AND here it may be proper to mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he grievances of the custom house. Trade is the natural right of all men, but it is so restrained, perplexed and fettered, that the of|ficers of the customs, where there happens a judge of ad|miralty to their purpose, can seize and get condemned any vessel or goods they see fit. They will seize a vessel withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shewing any other cause than their arbitrary will, and keep her a long time without exhibiting any libel, during all which time, the owner knows not on what ac|count she is seized, and when the trial comes on, he is utterly deprived of one by a jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, contrary to the usages among our fellow subjects in <HI>Britain,</HI> and perhaps all his fortune is determinable by a single, base, and infamous tool of a violent, corrupt, and wicked administration. Besides, these officers, who seem to be born with long cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws, like eagles, exact most exorbitant fees, even from small coast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng vessels, who pass along shore and carry from plantation to plantation, bread meat, firewood, and other necessaries, and without the intervention of which the coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry would labour under gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t inconveniences, direct|ly contrary to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and meaning of one of the acts of trade&punc; by which they pretend to govern themselves, such vessels by that act not being obliged to have so much as a reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ster. It is well known that their design in getting into office is to enrich themselves by fleecing the mer|chants, and it is thought that very few have any regard to the interest of the Crown, which is only a pretence they make in order to accomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ish their ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icious purposes.</P>
<P>THE <HI>common people</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> very liberally give and grant away the property of the <HI>Americans</HI> without their consent, which if yielded to by us must fix us in the lowest bottom of slavery: For if they can take away one penny from us against our wills, they can take all. If they have such power over our properties they must have a proportionable power over our persons; and from hence it will follow, that they can demand and take away our

lives, whensoever it shall be agreeable to their sovereign wills and pleasure.</P>
<P>THIS claim of the commons to a sovereignty over us, is founded by them on their being the <HI>Mother Country.</HI> It is true that the first emigrations were from <HI>England</HI>; but upon the whole, more settlers have come from <HI>Ire|land, Germany,</HI> and other par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of <HI>Europe</HI>&punc; than from <HI>Eng|land.</HI> But if every soul came from <HI>England,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would not give them any title to sovereignty or even to superiority. One spot of ground will not be sufficient for all: As pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es fill up, mankind must disperse, and go where they can find a settlement; and being born free, must carry with them their freedom and independence on their fel|lows, go where they will. Would it not be thought strange if the commonalty of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> should require our obedience, because this colony was first settled from that dominion? By the best accounts, <HI>Britain</HI> was peopled from <HI>Gaul,</HI> now called <HI>France,</HI> wherefore accord|ing to their principles the parliaments of <HI>France</HI> have a right to govern them. If this doctrine of the maternal authority of one country over another be a little examin|ed, it will be found to be the greatest absurdity that ever entered into the head of a politician &mdash; In the time of <HI>Nimrod,</HI> all mankind lived to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ether on the plains of <HI>Shi|nar,</HI> from whence they were dispersed at the building of <HI>Babel</HI> From that dispersion all the empi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, kingdoms, and states in the world are derived. That this doctrine may be fully exposed, let us suppose a few <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> to be the present inhabitants of the plains of <HI>Shinar,</HI> and that they shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d demand the obedience of every king|dom, state, and country in the world, on account of their being the <HI>Mother Country</HI> would it be one jot more ridi|culous than the claim made by the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to rule and reign over us? It is to be hoped that in fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, the words <HI>Mother Country</HI> will not be so frequently in our mouths, as they are only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds without meaning.</P>
<P>ANOTHER grievance to be considered, is the alarming attempt o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of <HI>Old England</HI> to restrain our ma|nufactures. This country abounds in iron, yet there is
<PB N="12" REF="010886_0011_0F86CC390D8C9508">
an act of parliament, passed in the late King's reign to restrain us from manufacturing it into plates and rods by mill-work, the last of which forms are absolutely necessary for the making of nails, the most useful article in a new country that can be conceived.&mdash;Be astonished all the world, that the people of a country who call themselves Christians and a civilized nation, should imagine that any principles of polic&egrave; will be a sufficient excuse, for their prohibiting their fellow subjects in a distant part of the earth from making use of the blessings of the GOD of nature! There would be just as much reason to prohi|bit us from spinning our wool and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax, or making up our cloaths. Such prohibitions are infractions on the natural rights of men, and are utterly void.</P>
<P>THEY have undertook, at the distance of three thou|sand miles, to regulate and limit our trade with the na|tives round about us, and from whom our lands were purchased&mdash;a trade which we opened ourselves, and which we ought to enjoy unrestricted. Further, we are pro|hibited by a people, who never set foot here from making any more purchases from the <HI>Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns,</HI> and even of settling those which we have made. The truth is, they intend to take into their own hands the whole of the back lands, witness the patents of immense tracts continually sol|licited, and making out to their own people. The con|sequence will be shocking, and we ought to be greatly alarmed at such a procedure. All new countries ought to be free to settlers; but instead thereof every settler on these patent lands, and their descendants forever, will be as compleat slaves to their landlords, as the common peo|ple of <HI>Poland</HI> are to their lords.</P>
<P>A standing army in time of profound peace is cantoned and quartered about the country to awe and intimidate the people&mdash;Men of war and cutters are in every port, to the great distress of trade. In time of war we had no sta|tion ships, but were obliged to protect our trade, but now in time of full peace, when there are none to make us afraid we are visited with the plague of men of war, who commit all manner of disorders and irregularities;
<PB N="13" REF="010886_0012_0F86CC39BB7B0D00">
and behave in as hostile a manner as if they were open and declared enemies. In open defiance of civility, and the laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which they profess to be go|verned by, they violently seize and forcibly carry on board their ships the persons of the King's loving subjects. What think ye my brethren, of a military government in each town?&mdash;Unless we exert ourselves in opposition to their plan of subjecting us, we shall all have soldiers quartered about upon us, who will take the absolute command of our families. Centry boxes will be set up in all the streets and passages, and none of us will be able to pass, without being brought too by a soldier with his fixed bayonet, and giving him a satisfactory account of ourselves and business. Perhaps it will be ordered that we shall put out fire and candle at eight of the clock at night, for fear of conspiracy. From which fearful calamities may the GOD of our fathers deliver us!</P>
<P>BUT after all, nothing which has yet happened ought to alarm us more then their suspending government here, because our parliaments or assemblies (who ought to be free) do not in their votes and resolutions please the po|pulace of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> Suppose a parcel of mercenary troops in <HI>England</HI> should go to the parliament house, and order the members to vote as they directed under pain of dissolution, how much liberty would be left to them&punc; In short, this dissolving of government upon such pretences as are formed, leaves not the semblance of liberty to the people.&mdash;We all ought to resent the treatment which the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> hath had, as their case may soon come to be our own.</P>
<P>We are constantly belied and misrepresented to our gra|cious sovereign, by the officers who are sent hither, and others who are in the cabal of ruining this country. They are the persons who ought to be called rebels and traitors, as their conduct is superlatively injurious to the King and his faithful subjects.</P>
<P>MANY other grievances might be enumerated, but the time would fail.&mdash;Upon the whole, the conduct of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> shews that they have formed a plan to subject us
<PB N="14" REF="010886_0013_0F86CC3C4288C9D8">
so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffectually to their absolute commands, that even t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> freedom of speech will be taken from us. This plan they are executing as fast as they can; and almost every day produces some effect of it. We are insulted and me|naced only for petitioning. Our prayers are prevented from reaching the royal ear, and our humble supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icati|ons to the throne are wickedly and maliciously represent|ed as so many marks of faction and disloyalty.

<P>WHEREFORE, dearly beloved, let us with unconque|rable resolution maintain and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end that liberty where|with GOD hath made us free. As the total subjection of a people arises generally from gradual encroachments, it will be our indispensible duty manfully to oppose every invasion of our righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the beginning Let nothing discourage us from this duty to ourselves and our poste|rity. Our fathers sought and found freedom in the wil|derness; they cloathed them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elves with the skins of wild beasts, and lodged under trees and among bushes; but in that state they were happy because they were free &mdash; Should these our noble ancestors arise from the dead, and find their posterity trucking away that liberty, which they purchased at so dear a rate, for the mean trifles and frivolous merchandize of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> they would re|turn to the grave with a holy indignation against us. In this day of danger let us exert every talent, and try eve|ry lawful mean, for the preservation of our liberties It is thought that nothing will be of more avail, in our present distressed situation, than to stop our imports from <HI>Britain.</HI> By such a measure this little colony would save more than 173&punc;000 pounds, lawful money, in one year, besides the advantages which would arise from the indus|try of the inhabitants being directed to the raising of wool and flax, and the establishment of manufactures.
