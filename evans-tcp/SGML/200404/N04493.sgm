<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE irregular</HI> Heats <HI>and</HI> Extrava|gancies <HI>of some late Pretenders to extraordinary Attainments in Re|ligion, their imaginary divine</HI> Impulses, <HI>and extatick</HI> Raptures, <HI>with other Ef|fects of their disorder'd Fancies, have cast such a</HI> Blemish <HI>upon the Christian Profession, in the Eyes of unsetled and unthinking People; that it's well if too many are not in Danger of calling</HI> Christianity <HI>it self into Question, from the manifestly false Pretences and en|thusiastick
<PB N="ii" REF="005572_0003_0000000000000000">
Flights of some, who have put in a Claim to so eminent Experi|ence in the divine Life.&mdash;It is there|fore thought needful, as well as season|able at this Time, that a brief and plain</HI> Confirmation <HI>of the</HI> Christian Religion <HI>be sent abroad among our People, to establish them, in the Foun|dation of our eternal Hope.&mdash;This has been my special Motive to the Publication of some of the first of the ensuing</HI> Letters.</P>
<P><HI>On the other Hand, whether for want of duly distinguishing between</HI> delusive Appearances, <HI>and the</HI> genuine Effects <HI>of an</HI> Effusion of the HOLY SPIRIT, <HI>or from whatever Cause, such has been the violent</HI> Opposition <HI>of some to the late</HI> Revival of Religion <HI>in the Land, that the Doctrines of</HI> special Grace <HI>and of</HI> experimental Piety <HI>seem now by too many not only rejected and
<PB N="iii" REF="005572_0004_0000000000000000">
opposed, but even treated with Contempt, under the opprobrious Character of</HI> New Light; <HI>as if they had never before been heard of, or professed among us. This I take to be one of the darkest Symptoms upon this Land, that we have ever yet seen.&mdash;It must on that Account be not unseasonable, to repre|sent to our People, in a clear and distinct View, the</HI> Experiences of vital Religion, <HI>which are necessary to con|stitute them</HI> Christians indeed.&mdash;<HI>This is aim'd at in the Publication of the most of the following</HI> Letters.</P>
<P><HI>The Danger we are in of prevailing</HI> Antinomianism, <HI>and the actual Pre|valence that it has already obtain'd (especially under the Name of</HI> Mora|vianism) <HI>in some Parts of the Country, is a sufficient Justification of the At|tempt I have made to set the Founda|tion-Error of the</HI> Antinomians <HI>in a

true Light; and to discover its dan|gerous Tendency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If any are inclined to censure me, for troubling the World with new Dis|courses upon such Subjects, as I had publickly treated on before; particu|larly the</HI> Evidences <HI>of Christianity, the</HI> Sovereignty <HI>of divine Grace,</HI> Faith <HI>and</HI> Justification: <HI>They may consider, that these are most important Points, and deserve the most particular Illustrati|on; that there is at this Time a special Call to remove the Objections against them out of the Way; and that this is now attempted in a different Manner, from my former Discourses on these Subjects; and, I trust, with some additional Evidence to the Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If any of my Readers are so curious as to inquire,</HI> to whom <HI>these</HI> Letters <HI>were directed; it's sufficient Answer,

that they are now by the Press directed to</HI> them; <HI>and if they can improve them to their spiritual Advantage, it will answer the End of their Publicati|on.&mdash;May the Blessing of</HI> GOD <HI>attend them to this Purpose!</HI></P>

<HEAD>FAMILIAR LETTERS ON A Variety of religious Subjects.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I. Wherein the Danger of Infidelity is briefly represented.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heartily rejoice to hear from you, that you are at last come into a <Q><HI>Resolution, immediately to enter upon a serious and impartial Exami|nation of the Christian Religion.</HI></Q> What you observe is certainly true, that <Q><HI>this is an Affair of too great Consequence, to be carelesly neg|lected, to be decided at the Clubb, or to be rejected by Wholesale, with the too common Arguments of Mirth and Raillery, Sneer and Banter.</HI></Q>&mdash;I should therefore be inexcusable, should I refuse a Compli|ance with your Request, to <Q><HI>maintain a Correspon|dence with you by Letter; and assist you, what I can,
<PB N="2" REF="005572_0009_0000000000000000">
in your Inquiries into the Truth of Christianity, the Nature of the Christian Institution, and the Character and Qualifications of those who are intitled to the Rewards therein promised.</HI></Q> But what can a Gen|tleman of your Capacities expect from <HI>me?</HI> And has not this Cause been clearly and fully handled, espe|cially of late, by a Variety of Authors? Has it not triumphed over all Opposition? Have not its poor deluded Opposers been cover'd with Shame and Confusion, in all their feeble Attempts to sub|vert our Faith, and to destroy the blessed Hope of our future Happiness? And are not these Books in your Hands?&mdash;Read them, Sir, with that Atten|tion, which such an awful and important Affair demands of you; and I think, you can't fail of obtaining Conviction and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>To your Inquiry, <Q><HI>How shall I first enter upon a proper Disquisition of this Cause?</HI></Q> I answer, in a few Words. Consider the Importance of it Consider, I intreat you, that it is an eternal Concern. Were this duly consider'd, it would be impossible for you to content your self in such a State, wherein there is so much as a Peradventure as to the dreadful and astonishing Consequences of a Disappointment.</P>
<P>You may perhaps have hitherto concluded all revealed Religion to be but a meer Cheat and Im|posture.&mdash;You may have borne your Part in the Conversation at Taverns or Coffee-Houses, against Priest-Craft, Cant, and Enthusiasm.&mdash;You may have ridiculed all Pretences to vital Piety; and exploded all the Gospel-Doctrines respecting future Rewards and Punishments, as unreasonable, or unintelligible Dreams and Fictions.&mdash;Well! supposing you were
<PB N="3" REF="005572_0010_0000000000000000">
in the right, What Happiness, what Comfort or Satisfaction would your Infidelity afford you?&mdash;What rational Man would envy you the Consolati|on, of imagining your self upon a Level with the <HI>Beasts,</HI> and of expecting, that <HI>Death</HI> will terminate all your Hopes and Fears!&mdash;What Believer would part with the glorious Hope, of eternal and inex|pressible Happiness and Joy, for the gloomy Prospect of <HI>Annihilation!</HI></P>
<P>It is certain, upon this Supposition, the <HI>Believer</HI> can be in no Danger; he has nothing to lose, or to fear: but has every Way the Advantage of you.&mdash;He has the present Satisfaction of being a Favourite of Heaven.&mdash;He has a continual Source of Support and Comfort, amidst the darkest Scenes of Providence, from the gracious Promises of the Gospel.&mdash;He can overcome the Miseries of Life and the Terrors of Death, with the ravishing View of a blessed Immor|tality.&mdash;And it is certain, if mistaken, he will never lament his Disappointment: but sleep as quietly in a State of Non-existence as you can do.</P>
<P>But perhaps I have mistook your Sentiments. You may possibly have given into an Opinion of a future Existence, though you have call'd the Truth of the <HI>Gospel</HI> into Question:&mdash;Be it so. Yet upon this Sup|position also, the Believer has vastly the Advantage of you. He has all the Happiness in this Life which Christianity affords: and this you must be a Stranger to.&mdash; He can live in Comfort, and die in Peace.&mdash;His Religion deprives him of nothing, which can any Way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his rational Happiness and Delight; but every Way tends to subserve and pro|mote them.&mdash;And certainly (even upon your own
<PB N="4" REF="005572_0011_0000000000000000">
Principles) he may have as fair a Claim to <HI>Sincerity,</HI> in his Endeavours to approve himself to the glorious Author of our Being, as you can have; and conse|quently as good a Prospect of future Blessedness.&mdash;So that, upon the whole, it is evident that he has nothing to fear from <HI>his Principles,</HI> whether they be <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false.</HI>&mdash;He has no Cause for those stinging Reflections; What if I am mistaken! What if my Sentiments should prove false, when it comes to the decisive Trial!</P>
<P>And now, let us turn the Tables; and consider the bitter Fruits of <HI>your</HI> fatal Mistake, if <HI>Christianity</HI> should at last prove <HI>true.</HI> &mdash;You can't but acknowledge, that there have been great Numbers of Men of the best moral Qualifications, whose intellectual Powers were no Ways inferiour to theirs on the other Side of the Question, who have professed the Truth, and experienced the Power of that Religion, which you have despised.&mdash;How many most excellent Persons, of the greatest Integrity, Learning, and Sagacity, have at their Peril appeared to stand by this Cause; and have sacrificed their Estates, their Honours, and their Lives, to the despised and persecuted Doctrines of the Cross!&mdash; It's certain, that you can't have a greater Assurance of being in the right, than these Men have had; and consequently there is at least a Probability on their Side, as much as on yours.&mdash;You your self therefore, and all the unbelieving Gentle|men of your Acquaintance, who have any Degree of Modesty lest, must necessarily own, that the Cause possibly may turn out against them.&mdash;And what if it should! I am even afraid to represent the Conse|quences in a proper Light; it will possibly be estee|med
<PB N="5" REF="005572_0012_0000000000000000">
Preachment or Cant; or be voted harsh, unci|vil, or unmannerly Treatment. But Sir, I would pray you to consider this Matter, without any Re|sentment of my rustick Method of Address. Consider it only as it is represented in the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> and in that View it will appear, that the dreadful Confusion, the amazing Horrour, and the eternal Misery, which will be the Consequence of your Infidelity, will be vastly beyond the utmost Stretch of your most exalted Apprehension or Imagination. As soon as your Soul is separated from your Body, it will be|come the immediate Object of the divine Wrath; and how lightly soever you may think of these Things at present, you will find, that it is <HI>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</HI>&mdash;When the great Judge of the World shall <HI>descend from Heaven, to take Vengeance on all those, who do not obey the Gospel of Jesus Christ,</HI> where will our unbelieving Gentlemen appear? Won't their Mirth be quite spoiled, their sarcastick Flouts and Fleers be for ever over, when they must stand trembling at the lest Hand of their Judge, having no possible Refuge to betake themselves, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Plea to make for their In|fidelity, no Place of Retreat in a dissolving World, to hide their Heads!&mdash;What Comfort will it then afford them, to say, "Alas! how have we been de|ceived! We never tho't it would have come to this! Now we have found to our Cost, that there is some|thing more in the Doctrines of a final Retribution, than Fable or Fiction, Priest-Craft or Fanaticism, however we have in the Gaiety of our Temper re|jected and despised them."&mdash;Will they then be pos|sess'd of a sufficient Bravery and Presence of Mind,
<PB N="6" REF="005572_0013_0000000000000000">
to out face their glorious Judge; and to hear with Intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pidity the terrible Sentence, <HI>Depart, ye cursed, into overlying Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</HI>&mdash;Will they with their usual frolick Humour, endure the Execution of this Sentence; and with Sport and Pastime, welter in the eternal Flames of that Furnace of Fire, that is the destin'd Abode of every final Unbeliever?</P>
<P>Now, Sir, does it not infinitely concern you, to consider the Case before you in this awful View, to compare and make a proper Estimate of the incon|ceivably different States of the Believer and the In|fidel, both with Respect to Time and Eternity; and to enter upon the Disquisition you propose, with a Mind duly impressed with the vast Importance of your coming to a safe Conclusion?</P>
<P>You tell me, that you <Q><HI>can't from the Nature of Things see any Necessity of such a Way of Salva|tion, as the Gospel proposes. The Light of Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us, that God is merciful; and consequently that he will pardon Sinners, upon their Repentance and Amendment of Life.</HI></Q> Let us then consider this Case impartially.</P>
<P>I think, there is no Need of Arguments to con|vince you, that you are a <HI>Sinner.</HI> Do but consider the natural Tendency of your Affections, Appetites and Passions; and review the past Conduct of your Life; and a Demonstration of this sad Truth will unavoidably stare you in the Face.&mdash;Let any Man enter into himself; and seriously consider the natural Operations of his own Mind; and he must neces|sarily find, that instead of a frequent and delightful Contemplation of the Perfections of the divine
<PB N="7" REF="005572_0014_0000000000000000">
Nature, instead of a thankful Acknowledgement of his Obligations to the divine Goodness and Benefi|cence, and instead of that sublime Pleasure and Satisfaction, that should flow from the Remembrance of his Creator and Benefactor, his Affections are naturally following mean low and unreasonable, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and wicked Entertainments and Gratificati|ons. He will find, that all Communications with his glorious Creator are naturally painful and uneasy to him: while every trifling Amusement, and the vilest sensual Object of his Thoughts, find a more easy Entrance, and a more peaceable Rest in his Soul.&mdash;From hence it is most evident, that the Heart is revolted from God; and that we have substituted the Creature in his Stead, as the Object of our Pursuit and Delight.&mdash; And besides this; Who are there among the best of the Children of Men, whose Consciences will not charge them with innumerable actual Transgressions of the Law of Nature?&mdash;From this View of the Case, you must therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> find your self in a State of mo|ral Pollution and Guilt.</P>
<P>And can you in such a State as this, reflect upon a God of infinite <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> with Comfort and Courage? Won't Conscience fly in your Face, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you with your Guilt and Danger? Don't your Reason tell you, that the great Creator and Governour of the World is too holy to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and too just to overlook such a fixed Aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">on to him; and such numerous Sins and Provocation against him, as you cannot but charge to your own Account?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005572_0015_0000000000000000">But <HI>"God is merciful."</HI> True, he is so, to all proper <HI>Objects</HI> of Mercy; and in a <HI>Way</HI> agreeable to the Laws of his immutable Justice and Holiness. But can you suppose, that God will give up his Justice and Holiness, as a Sacrifice to his Mercy, out of Compassion to those, who deserve no Pity from him, to those who refuse the Offers of his Mercy in the Gospel, because disagreeable to their sinful Desires and Imaginations?</P>
<P>But <Q><HI>Repentance will entitle the Sinner to Pardon, without any other Atonement.</HI></Q>&mdash;Are you sure of this? Certain it is, that Mankind have always, in all Ages, thought otherwise. What else was the Meaning of those Sacrifices, that have every where obtain'd; and what the Meaning of those supersti|tious Austerities, and severe Penances, that have been so commonly practis'd in the Heathen World, if some Atonement beside Repentance, was not thought necessary to pacify an offended Deity?&mdash; Consider, I entreat you, that as Sin is contrary to the divine Nature, it must be the Object of God's Displeasure. As it is contrary to the Rules of his governing the World, it must deserve Punishment.&mdash;If God be the Rector and Governour of the World, he must have some Laws to govern by. If he has Laws to govern by, they must have some Penalties to enforce them. If his Laws have Penalties annexed to them, these must be executed; or else they would be but Scare|Crows, without Truth or Justice.&mdash;I entreat you also to consider, how the Repentance of a guilty Criminal can answer the Demands of Justice.&mdash;What Satisfaction will our Sorrow for Sin afford
<PB N="9" REF="005572_0016_0000000000000000">
to the divine Being? How will it repair the Dishonour done to the Perfections of his Nature? How will it rectify our depraved Appetites and Passions; and qualify us for the Enjoyment of his Favour? How will it vindicate his Holiness; and discover to the rational World, his natural Aversion to Sin and Sinners? Or how will the Feat of God's Displeasure be a sufficient Restraint to Men's Lusts and vicious Appetites, if Sinners may suppose, that when they have gratified their Lusts, and taken their Swing in Sin, they can repent when they please; and thereby have an easy Access to the Favour of God? In a Word, What Evidence can you possibly pretend to from the Light of Nature, that Repentance only will satisfy the divine Justice; and reconcile you to God?</P>
<P>But after all, were it even supposed that Repen|tance would necessarily give us a Claim to Mercy, without any other Satisfaction to God's Justice, it must then be another Sort of Repentance, than you seem to suppose. You must then allow, that this Repentance must be a thorough Change of Heart and Life. For you can hardly suppose, that we are qualified for God's Favour, while all the Powers of our Souls are in direct Opposition and Aversation to him. And is this Repentance in our Power? Can we at Pleasure renew our own Souls; and give our selves new Affections, Dispositions, Desires and Delights? Can we change the Bent and Bias of our Inclinations to the Objects of Sense, and bring our selves to love God above all Things; and to take our chief Delight and Complacency in him?&mdash;This must be obtain'd, in Order to enjoy the
<PB N="10" REF="005572_0017_0000000000000000">
Favour of God. And yet it is manifestly out of our Reach. It must be the Effect of an Almighty Power.</P>
<P>I hope, you may now see the Necessity of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> both to expiate your Sin and Guilt, which your Repentance can never do; and to sanctify your depraved Soul; and make you meet for the Service and Enjoyment of God.&mdash;If these are ob|tain'd, you must be certainly and eternally safe: but if you dare venture into Eternity without them, I must needs say you don't want Courage.</P>
<P>You see, I have addressed you with an unreserv'd Freedom and Familiarity. I have overlook'd the Distance of your Character; and treated you as if we were in the same State of Equality now, as we shall quickly find our selves before the Tribunal of our glorious Judge.&mdash;The Cause requires this at my Hands; and I should have been unfaithful, I had almost said unmerciful to you, if I had not fail'd of the Decorum, which would have been my Duty to have observ'd in any other Case. I shall therefore depend upon your candid Interpretation of this unpolish'd Address; and your kind Accep|tance of the faithful Designs and Desires of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Wherein a brief and general View is given, of the Evidences of the Christian Religion.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU tell me, <Q><HI>my Letter had almost thrown you into a Fit of the Spleen.</HI></Q> But I can't but hope, from your <Q><HI>awful Concern, left you meet with the Confusion I have therein described,</HI></Q> that it will have a better Effect.&mdash;I acknowledge, that <Q><HI>a pathetick Declamation cannot be received for Argument.</HI></Q> And that <Q><HI>your Faith must be built upon Evidences, that will reach the Under|standing, as well as the softer Passions of the Soul.</HI></Q> But what Evidence do you desire or want, of the Truth of Christianity? Consider, Sir. Consult your Books and your Friends. Make your De|mands as large, as you or they can contrive. And whatever rational Evidence you are pleased to ask for, shall be at your Service.&mdash;I have myself with particular Application been considering, what reasonable Evidence can possibly be con|sulted or desired, which the glorious God has not already given us, in Confirmation of the Christian Institution; and I find Nothing wanting, which we are capable of receiving.&mdash;And I can't but
<PB N="12" REF="005572_0019_0000000000000000">
presume, that if you likewise would impartially and in earnest put your self upon the same Enquiry, you must meet with a full and compleat Satis|faction.</P>
<P>You will certainly acknowledge, that the great Creator is capable some Way or other to commu|nicate his Will to intelligent Beings, with sufficient Evidence that the Revelation is from him.&mdash;Now what I desire of you is to sit down, and consult upon some such Means of doing this, as would strike your Mind with the strongest Conviction, obviate all your Doubts; and give you the fullest Confirmation of the divine Original of such a Re|velation. When you are come to a Point, consider the Credentials of Christianity; and see whether you can find what you your self would demand, and what you suppose most likely to give you Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Would you expect from such a Revelation, a reasonable Account of our first Original?&mdash;Look into the <HI>Mosaic</HI> History of the Creation; and there you will find, how the World, and how yourself originally sprang from the divine <HI>Fiat;</HI> and in what Manner we are the Offspring of God.</P>
<P>Would you expect a Narrative of such Circum|stances of God's Dispensations towards us from the Beginning, as would be correspondent with our constant Experience and Observation?&mdash;The same History will inform you of those irregular Affecti|ons, and vitiated Appetites and Passions, which every Man finds in himself; and which have bro't such Destruction and Misery upon the World, in all its successive Periods, since <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall.</P>

<P>Would you desire to find a particular Prediction of the promised <HI>Saviour,</HI> by whom we are to obtain a Redemption; his Lineage and Descent, the Time, Place and Manner of his Birth, the Circumstances of his Life, Death and Resurrection, a particular Description of the Nature, the Subjects, and the continual Progress of his Kingdom?&mdash;Read the Prophecies of the Old Testament; and read the History in the New; and you will find such a Correspondence and Agreement, as will afford you Matter of fullest Satisfaction, that they are both from God.</P>

<P>Thus, Sir, I have set before you, in the closest and most connected View, some brief Hints of the Credentials of Christianity.&mdash;I know, you are ca|pable of extending your Demands yet further; and of proposing something else, that may still serve to reflect new Light upon the Christian Revelation: And there is yet much more at your Service, when you'll be pleased to make your Demands. You must however in the mean Time allow me the Freedom to say, that the Evidence now in View is sufficient to fill the Mind of every unprejudiced Person, with a necessary and infallible Certainty of the Truth we are inquiring after.&mdash;Deliberately consider each of these Arguments separately and particularly; consider them all in their Connection and Relation to each other; and then try whe|ther you can refuse your Assent to the Gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>There is (I'm sensible) one <HI>Objection</HI> ready to offer it self to your Mind against all this; and that is, How do I know, that the great and principal <HI>Facts,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="005572_0028_0000000000000000">
upon which Christianity is especially built, may be depended upon, as certainly true?&mdash;How do I know the Congruity of the Prophecies with the Event?&mdash;How do I know the miraculous Concep|tion of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Attestation of the Angels to his Birth; or that he wrought such Miracles in Confirmation of his divine Mission; and that he rose again from the Dead; and ascen|ded up to Heaven?&mdash;How do I know, that his Apostles were inspired with such extraordinary and divine Gifts; or that they perform'd such miracu|lous Operations?</P>
<P>To this I answer, that some of the Evidences which I have offered, are what directly, upon the very first View, you may know, and cannot but know, to be certainly and infallibly true, if you will but open your Eyes to observe them.&mdash;You do certainly know, that human Nature is dreadfully corrupted and vitiated, that it is opposite to the Holiness and Purity of the divine Being; and that there is therefore great Necessity of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> to bring us to God, and to rectify our depraved Na|ture.&mdash;You may certainly know, that there a great Variety of Predictions of such a <HI>Saviour,</HI> dispersed through the whole Old Testament; and that the whole Nation of the <HI>Jews</HI> always did, and still do, from thence live in raised Expectation of a <HI>Messiah.</HI>&mdash;You may certainly know, that there were a great Number of Rites and Ceremonies religiously ob|served and practised among the <HI>Jews;</HI> and that <HI>sacrificing,</HI> in particular, was not only enjoin'd upon them, but early and generally practised among all Nations. For none of which Things can there be

any Manner of Reason given or imagined, unless they were Types and Adumbrations of an expected <HI>Saviour.</HI>&mdash;You may certainly know, that the Time prefixed in the <HI>Jewish Prophecies</HI> for the Manifesta|tion of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> was the very Time, in which by the concurring Testimony both of the Friends and Enemies of Christianity, the Lord Jesus did appear.&mdash;You may certainly know, that the Jewish Pro|phets did foretel a <HI>suffering Saviour,</HI> a Saviour that should be <HI>wounded for our Transgressions, bruised for our Iniquities,</HI> that should <HI>make his Soul an Offering for Sin;</HI> and that should <HI>be cut off, but not for himself:</HI> and you are equally certain from all other Historians, as well as from the Evangelists, that our Lord Jesus did undergo such Opproby, Misery and Death, as was foretold of the <HI>Messiah</HI> by the Pro|phets.&mdash;You may certainly know, that it was fore|told in the <HI>Prophets,</HI> that <HI>the Scepter should not depart from Judah, and a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until the coming of the Messiah;</HI> But that after his Death, the Jewish Sacrifices <HI>should cease; and their holy City and Sanctuary be destroy'd and made desolate:</HI> and that the Event does assure us, that the Circumstances of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> did exactly answer to these Prophecies, both before and after the Death of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;You may certainly know, both by the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian Prophecies,</HI> that under the Gospel Dispensation, the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be rejected of God; and to continue, despised and dispersed among all Nations; but <HI>the Gentiles to come to the Light of the Messiah, and see his Righ|teousness and Glory:</HI> and that the Event is agreeable to the Prediction.&mdash;You may certainly know, that

the Rise of <HI>Antichrist</HI> was predicted to be after the Fall of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> when that could no longer let or restrain him; that he should appear under the Guise of a Minister of Religion, <HI>in the Temple of God;</HI> that he should pretend to <HI>all Power and Signs and lying Wonders;</HI> that he should <HI>make War with the Saints and overcome them;</HI> that he should reside in <HI>the great City,</HI> that was then built <HI>upon seven Mountains,</HI> and <HI>reign'd over the Kings of the Earth,</HI> which was true of the City of <HI>Rome</HI> only. And you may consider, whether all this is not true of the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Roman Papacy.</HI>&mdash;You may certainly know the amazing Progress of the Gospel in the first Ages of Christianity, in the Face of the most formidable and powerful Oppositions; and its continuing Progress, against all the Attempts of its heathen and papa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Enemies.&mdash;You may know the Excellency of its Doctrines; and the glorious Effects it hath upon the Hearts and Lives of true Believers.&mdash;You may know (as, blessed be God, Multitudes do know, by Experience) how it conquers Men's Corruptions, changes their Natures, pacifies their Consciences, fills their Souls with Light and Joy, strengthens them against Temptations, sweetens the Afflictions of Life; and fortifies 'em against all the Pains and Terrors of Death.&mdash;And you also may know, that this Gospel is the Gospel of Christ, and consequently that these wonderful Effects, which so apparently carry a divine Signature upon them, are produced by him.&mdash;All these Things, and others of a like Nature which might be mentioned, are immediately open to your View, most visible and certain; and one would think, that these alone
<PB N="24" REF="005572_0031_0000000000000000">
would satisfy the Mind of a serious and impartial Enquirer into the Truth of Christianity. And especially when these are accompanied with such other Credentials of our holy Religion, which (though not so directly in View, yet) by necessary Consequence give us the same Assurance and Cer|tainty of the Truth.</P>
<P>But it's Time I should come more directly to an|swer the Objection; and to shew you, how it may by necessary Consequence be known, that the <HI>Facts</HI> upon which Christianity principally depends, are certainly true.</P>
<P>You your self must own, it's impossible that those Doctrines can be false, which are attested by so many and such Kind of <HI>Miracles,</HI> as are said to be wrought by our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles.</HI>&mdash;For God cannot set his Seal to a Lie; nor confirm a horrible Imposture, by his immediate Attestation from Heaven.</P>
<P>You must own, that it's impossible for the <HI>Apostles</HI> and other Witnesses of these miraculous Operations, to be themselves <HI>deceived,</HI> while they had all the Means of Certainty in the Case before us, that ever any Man had in any Case whatso|ever.</P>
<P>You must likewise own, that it's impossible for a great Number of sober, judicious, and apparently honest Men, to spend their Lives in a continued Conspiracy against their own Ease, Comfort, Honour, Life, and eternal Welfare, for no other <HI>Motive,</HI> but to <HI>deceive</HI> the World; and bring eternal Ruin upon <HI>themselves</HI> and their <HI>Fellow-Creatures;</HI> as these must have done, if they knew those Facts to be false,
<PB N="25" REF="005572_0032_0000000000000000">
which they publish'd at their Peril, and sealed with their Blood.</P>
<P>You must also own, that it was impossible to de|ceive the <HI>World</HI> about them, at the Time when these Facts were done, by reporting, that such mi|raculous Operations were openly perform'd before them all, which none of them knew any Thing about.</P>
<P>You will certainly own, it's impossible that they could deceive the <HI>Churches</HI> to whom they wrote, by vain Pretences, that each one of these had themselves the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, such as Tongues, Miracles, Healing, Prophecy, and the like, when every one of them knew that there was nothing in it.</P>
<P>You must in like Manner own it impossible for such <HI>Multitudes</HI> of People, for so <HI>long</HI> a Tract of Time, to be imposed upon by Pretences of miracu|lous Operations; and none of them ever <HI>detect</HI> the Imposture, so much as in one single Instance, while all of them had the Opportunity of doing it when they pleased, if the Facts had not been true.</P>
<P>Can you imagine it any Ways possible, that such Multitudes in the first Ages of Christianity, in such distant Countries and Nations, should conspire to|gether to <HI>acknowledge</HI> these Facts, and the Doctrines founded on them, at the Peril of their Lives; and no Man among these Professors themselves, or a|mong the Hereticks and Apostates that fell away from them, should discover the Fraud, either living or dying?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005572_0033_0000000000000000">You will certainly own it utterly impossible, that so many Thousands, in so many Lands, could with Joy and Chearfulness submit to such <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>afflic|ted Lives,</HI> and to such <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>barbarous Deaths,</HI> as were the common Lot of the first Christians, in Confirmation of a Religion, founded upon Facts which they knew to be <HI>false.</HI></P>
<P>And you must acknowledge it also altogether im|possible, at any Time after these Facts were preten|ded to be done, to palm the <HI>History</HI> of them upon the World, if it was false; and to perswade so many Nations to receive it for <HI>Truth.</HI>&mdash;It were im|possible to perswade any <HI>Nations,</HI> and much more all the <HI>early</HI> Nations of <HI>Christendom,</HI> that at some distant forgotten Age there were a Number of Men that came among them, taught them the Doctrines of Christianity, confirm'd the same by Miracles, baptized them into the Faith; and established a settled Order of the Ministry in their Churches: From which Time, they have all of them professed the Christian Faith; had the <HI>New Testament</HI> in their Hands; and enjoy'd a continued Succession of Ministers and Or|dinances.&mdash;Let an Attempt of this Kind be made upon our <HI>Indians,</HI> and try, if any one Man among them, can be impos'd upon, to believe these Things.</P>
<P>To this I may add, that it is absolutely impossible, <HI>at any one Time,</HI> to have obtruded the inspired Wri|tings upon the World, if they were indeed spurious; and to have made all the Christian Nations believe, that these were written in the Apostolick Age, spee|dily translated into divers Languages, publickly kept, and publickly read and preached in their Churches;
<PB N="27" REF="005572_0034_0000000000000000">
that they and their Fathers before them had always reverenced and esteemed them as the Rule of their Lives; and their Guide to eternal Happiness.&mdash;What Success, but Scorn and Derision, could be hoped for from such an Attempt?</P>
<P>I may once more subjoin to all this, that it is at least highly improbable, that the <HI>early Writers</HI> against Christianity should never <HI>deny</HI> these Facts, if they were not notoriously true, when they could not want Advantages to detect any Fraud or Deceit, that can possibly be supposed in a Case of this Kind.&mdash;And it is yet more improbable, that any of the <HI>Adversa|saries</HI> of Christianity should <HI>confirm</HI> the Truth of these Facts, as we find some of them do, if they had not been most apparently and undoubtedly true.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, what can be wanting, what can you demand or desire more, to confirm you in the Faith of Christianity? It is establish'd upon the Veracity of God himself; upon those Facts, by which he has from Heaven attested to the Truth of it; and these Facts are verified by Evidences, which cannot possibly deceive us.&mdash;By believing therefore, <HI>we set to our Seal that God is true:</HI> But <HI>he that believeth not, maketh him a Lyar; because he believ|eth not the Record that God gave of his Son.</HI></P>
<P>You may perhaps tell me, that if you had <HI>seen</HI> these Miracles your self, you would have believed them.&mdash;But han't every Body else the same Claim to this Sort of Satisfaction as you; and the same Reason to desire, to be Eye and Ear-Witnesses of such miraculous Operations?&mdash;At this Rate, Mira|cles would cease to be miraculous, they would be|come
<PB N="28" REF="005572_0035_0000000000000000">
come common and familiar Things; and no longer strike the Mind with any Conviction at all, any more than the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, the rising and setting of the Sun; or any other such Displays of the divine Power, in the common Course of Providence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there is no Evidence wanting, to leave the Unbeliever inexcusable.&mdash;There is Evidence every Way sufficient, to satisfy the Mind of an impartial Enquirer after Truth. And it is impossible for any Man in the World to imagine any Means of Confirmation in this important Truth, superiour to what is herein set before you.&mdash;How unreasonable would it therefore be, to require more Evidence in a Case, wherein we have already as much as we are possibly capable to receive?&mdash;That it may be effectual to establish you in the Faith, is and shall be the Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. Wherein is consi|der'd the Certainty of those Facts, upon which the Evidence of Chri|stianity depends.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mistake in supposing, that <Q><HI>my last Letter has set the Evidence of our Saviour's divine Mission, from the Old-Testament-Prophecies, in the strongest Light.</HI></Q>&mdash;There might be much stronger Light brought from the prophetick Wri|tings, in Confirmation of this blessed Truth: and yet you must allow me the Freedom to tell you, that my Letter justly demands of you a firmer Assent, than you are pleased to express, to that fun|damental Article of our Faith and Hope. It re|presents to you more than <Q><HI>a strong Probability,
<PB N="47" REF="005572_0054_0000000000000000">
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and the Savi|our of the World.</HI></Q>&mdash;Consider, I beseech you, whether it is possible, for any or for all created Intelligences, to <HI>foresee</HI> and <HI>foretell</HI> such future Events, as depend wholly upon the meer good Pleasure of God; Such Events as are altogether out of the Way of God's ordinary Dispensati|ons of Providence; and such Events as had not the least Probability from the known Laws of Nature, to have ever come to pass; and then to <HI>overrule</HI> the various Revolutions of Nature and Providence in such a Way, as is utterly incon|sistent with, and in many Instances altogether contrary to, the known stated Methods of God's governing the World, in Order that those Predic|tions (even in every particular Circumstance) should be exactly accomplished.&mdash;I intreat you, Sir, to consider the Affair in this View (for in this View it ought to be consider'd) and then tell me, whether the Evidence don't amount to more than a strong Probability.&mdash;And consider what Evidence of this Kind you your self can possibly imagine, that would bring your Mind into a full Acquies|cence in this Truth, as certain and undoubted.</P>
<P>If there can be any reasonable Doubt remaining, it must be for one of these following Causes. Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. It must be supposed, that the <HI>Jewish Prophets</HI> had no such Events <HI>in their Eye;</HI> that the quoted Predictions had a Reference to something else; or perhaps no Reference to any Thing at all: but were the <HI>casual</HI> Sallies of the several Authors fruitful Fancies or Imaginations.</P>
<P>But then, if this be supposed, how comes it to pass that they are all so exactly verified?&mdash;Cer|tain
<PB N="48" REF="005572_0055_0000000000000000">
it is, that the Jews supposed all these Predic|tions to be divine Inspirations, kept up stated Me|morials of them, and longed for their Accom|plishment. And it is equally certain, that at the very Time when they ought to be expected, they were all fulfilled, in every Circumstance.&mdash;This is an Affair that demands your Attention.&mdash;Here are Predictions of most wonderful amazing Events; such as no Appearances, that ever had been in the World, could any Way lead the Minds of the Prophets to think of, or imagine.&mdash;These Even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s were foretold as to Time, Place, and many other particular Circumstances, that you see a History of our Saviour's Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascen|sion, and future Kingdom, could be made up out of these Prophecies:&mdash;and to crown the whole, they have all been exactly fulfilled. Now then, I have a Right to demand; Were these <HI>from Hea|ven,</HI> or <HI>of Men?</HI> Can the most licentious Imagina|tion apprehend these very numerous and various Predictions to be the Effects of capricious Fancies; and their Fulfilment, a Matter of mere Chance or Casualty? Then may the Epicurean Philosophy take Place again; and the World in all its Glory, Order and Symmetry, be reasonably believed to be the Effect of a fortuitous Concourse and Jumble of Atoms. I hope, this Doubt is cleared out of your Way; and I know of but one more that can re|main: Which is,</P>
<P N="2">2. That there <HI>never</HI> were any such <HI>Predictions</HI> of these Things in the <HI>Jewish Prophets:</HI> but that all of them were written <HI>since the Events.</HI></P>
<P>But then, you must suppose, that this was done by the <HI>Christians,</HI> without the Privity of the <HI>Jews</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="005572_0056_0000000000000000">
and others, who had these Books in their Hands; or that it was done by a joint Confederacy of <HI>Chri|stians</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI>&mdash;If the former, you must imagine, that the whole Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and all the other Nations who had the <HI>Greek</HI> Translation of the Jew|ish Bible in their Hands, must be perswaded to be|lieve, that they always had and always read those Things in their Bible, which were never there; or else all of them to a Man must be prevailed upon, out of Complaisance to their greatest Adversaries, to interpolate their Bibles, by inserting these Predicti|ons; and not leave to Posterity a single Copy un|adulterated, to discover and correct the Fraud.&mdash;But if you chuse the latter of those Supposals, that these Prophecies were added to the Jewish Bibles by a joint Confederacy of <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> you must imagine, that the whole <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> in all their most distant Dispersions, united in a Confederacy to furnish the World with Armour against their own Infidelity; and to represent themselves as the most unreasonable and wicked of all Mankind.&mdash;These Absurdities are (I am sure) too gross for you to entertain; and yet I may venture to challenge you to think of any other Way, in which it is possi|ble this could be done.</P>
<P>But you tell me, <Q><HI>It yet appears the greatest Dif|ficulty to you, to come at any Certainty of the Truth of those Facts, upon which the Evidence of Christi|anity depends.</HI></Q> And I readily acknowledge, that if these Facts are not true, all our Reasonings from Prophecy, and Miracles too, will come to Nothing. It is therefore proper, to consider this Case more particularly.&mdash;And in Order that this may be brought
<PB N="50" REF="005572_0057_0000000000000000">
into the closest View, and the Conclusion necessarily force it self upon our Minds; let us consider what <HI>Consequences</HI> must follow upon the Supposal, that these Facts are not true.&mdash;You can have no rational Doubt of these Things, but upon one of these Sup|positions: either,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and other Reporters of these Facts, did <HI>themselves certainly know</HI> that their <HI>Narra|tives</HI> of these Miracles were all of them mere <HI>Ficti|ons</HI> and <HI>Falshoods:</HI> and that they never did in Fact see any such miraculous Works perform'd by <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> that they never did see and converse with him after his Resurrection; and that they never had those miraculous Gifts and Powers themselves; nor ever instrumentally conveyed them to others.&mdash;Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Reporters of these Facts, and many Thousands of others, had their <HI>Senses</HI> and <HI>Imagina|tions imposed upon;</HI> and were made to believe that they did see, hear, and feel, such miraculous Ope|rations, as were never perform'd.&mdash;Or else,</P>
<P N="3">3. That this whole History was an <HI>After-Game;</HI> and a mere Piece of <HI>Forgery</HI> obtruded upon the World, after the Facts were pretended to be done.</P>
<P>These are all the Suppositions, that can possibly be made in this Case. And I have already in my second Letter offer'd you some Proof, that they are all of them unreasonable and absurd.&mdash;However, for your Satisfaction, I will endeavour to shew you under each of these Suppositions, some of those Absurdities that will necessarily follow from them.</P>
<P>In the first Place, If it be supposed, that the <HI>Re|porters</HI> of these Facts did themselves certainly <HI>know</HI> that they were <HI>false,</HI> then it will follow, that <HI>Thou|sands
<PB N="51" REF="005572_0058_0000000000000000">
of others,</HI> before whom these Miracles were said to be done, did also certainly know that they were mere Fictions and Fables. For they were as capable of Certainty, whether they had seen those Multitudes of plain open visible Facts, which are reported, as the Apostles were themselves.&mdash;Upon this Supposal, all <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> must certainly know, that they never saw any such Descent of the Holy Ghost in cloven Tongues upon the Apostles and Company; and that they knew Nothing of those Gifts of Languages, which were pretended.&mdash;The several Churches throughout the World, among whom the Apostles went, did certainly know, that they saw no Miracles wrought by them in Confir|mation of their Mission; that they never had nor knew any Thing about those miraculous Gifts, which were said to be so common among them. And yet that all these <HI>conspired</HI> in the Deceit (<HI>Jews,</HI> as well as <HI>Gentiles</HI>) to the utter Subversion of the Religion in which they had been educated; and Multitudes of them at the Expence of their Honours, Estates, and Lives, not one Person among them all appear|ing to detect the Villainy. The <HI>Jews</HI> tamely sub|mitting to the Loss of their Religion, and to the Imputation of the blackest Crime, that ever was committed; and the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> as tamely submitting to all that is shocking and terrible to Nature, rather than contradict and disprove what they knew to be false.&mdash;Nay, what is more surpri|zing still, all of these even the greatest <HI>Enemies</HI> of Christianity among them have not only allowed, but actually asserted the Truth of these Facts; which, upon this Supposal, they might have so easily
<PB N="52" REF="005572_0059_0000000000000000">
disproved, to the utter Ruin of the Christian Cause. And to crown all, there can be no <HI>Motive</HI> in the World imagin'd, to put any of them upon acknow|ledging such notorious and abominable Falshoods.&mdash;As I know, on the one Hand, that you cannot swallow such gross Absurdities as these; so I also know, on the other Hand, that you have no Way to avoid them, upon the Supposition before us.</P>
<P>It may be further observ'd, that if the Reporters of these Miracles did themselves know, that their Narratives were fictitious and false, it will also fol|low, that the most <HI>vile</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> Men that ever were in the World, and the most abandon'd to all Sense of Vertue and Piety, did draw up the <HI>best System</HI> of practical Religion, the most wor|thy of God and Man, that ever was known; that they, contrary to their inward Principles, sat the best <HI>Examples,</HI> and walk'd according to the Rules of this Religion themselves; yea, without any known Motive, spent their whole Lives in a continued Course of the greatest Toil, Fa|tigue, and Misery, that ever Men did, to promote this Religion, to impress it upon the Minds of others, and to teach them, according to it, to live in the Love and Fear of God.&mdash;It will also follow, that these Enemies of God and Godliness (who were so profane, as against their own Light to propagate this Imposture, in the Name of God Almighty) did not only give up the Hopes of future Happiness, but all the Comforts of this Life also, in <HI>Vindication</HI> of this known <HI>Falsehood;</HI> that to this End they ven|tured upon every Thing that is most terrible and affrightning to human Nature, and even upon the
<PB N="53" REF="005572_0060_0000000000000000">
most cruel and barbarous <HI>Death,</HI> without the least possible Hopes of Advantage, either in this World or that to come.&mdash;For they did know, and could not but know, that they were going themselves, and leading their Followers, upon the Pikes of their numerous and potent Adversaries, without any Pro|spect beyond the Grave (upon the Supposition before us) but of eternal <HI>Damnation.</HI>&mdash;And what still in|creases the Absurdity of this Supposition, is, that not one of these ever <HI>retracted</HI> this known Falsehood, even in the Article of Death: but boldly encoun|tred the most shameful and painful Death their Ad|versaries could inflict, rather than confess the Truth.&mdash;What, Sir, can you possibly imagine of such Conduct as this?&mdash;That these Men were not mad and distracted, appears evidently by their <HI>Works;</HI> which, though plain and familiar, were the most consistent, divine, and rational, that ever appeared in the World.&mdash;Here must therefore be a continued Scene of <HI>Miracles,</HI> one Way or other. It must at least be allowed miraculous, for so many Men knowingly and continually to act in direct Oppo|sition to all their Interests, Comforts and Hopes; and run counter to all the Principles of Humanity, to all the Springs of Action, that were ever known among Men.</P>
<P>Let us now try the <HI>second</HI> Supposal; and inquire whether it is possible, that the Reporters of these Facts, and all other Spectators of them, had their <HI>Senses imposed upon,</HI> by any legerdemain Trick, Juggle or Deceit?&mdash;Whether, for Instance, the Senses of the Apostles were imposed upon for some Years together, while there were daily Miracles
<PB N="54" REF="005572_0061_0000000000000000">
wrought by their Master, before their Eyes? Whe|ther the Senses of whole Multitudes were imposed upon, that they really thought they saw the sick healed, the dead raised, &amp;c; and these Things re|peated again and again for a long Tract of Time, when there was indeed nothing at all in't?&mdash;Whe|ther the Witnesses of our Lord's Resurrection were imposed upon, when they supposed they saw him after his Death, ate and drank and conversed famili|arly with him for forty Days together, and beheld him taken up to Heaven before their Eyes?&mdash;And whether all the first Churches were imposed upon, when they imagin'd that they saw Miracles repeat|edly wrought among them; and had themselves miraculous Gifts and Powers?&mdash;If these extravagant Suppositions are allowed, of what Service can our Senses be to us; and how can we any Way be cer|tain of any Thing whatsoever?&mdash;We may as rea|sonably imagine, that our whole Life has been one continued Dream; and that in Reality we never saw, heard, felt, thought, spake, or acted any Thing at all.&mdash;Here likewise you must necessarily allow a continued Course of <HI>Miracles,</HI> one Way or other. At least it must be allowed miraculous, that so great a Part of the World should all lose their Senses together; and yet all of them imagine that they had all this Time their Senses in their full Exercise.</P>
<P>Let us next consider, whether the last of the Suppositions, that the whole History of the Mira|cles wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apo|stles, was an <HI>After-Game,</HI> a mere Piece of Forgery, obtruded upon the World in some distant Time after the Facts were pretended to be done, will ap|pear
<PB N="55" REF="005572_0062_0000000000000000">
more reasonable, than the others already con|sider'd.</P>
<P>I have spoken something to this in my second Letter, to which I refer you: and shall now only add some Hints further to illustrate the Case before us.&mdash;If this last Case be supposed, the Forgery must be palm'd upon the World, either before or after Christianity had <HI>generally</HI> obtain'd. If this false History was thrust upon the World in some distant Age after the Facts were pretended to be done, <HI>be|fore</HI> Christianity had generally obtain'd, it will then follow, that all the Historians of those Times (Chri|stian, Jewish, and Pagan) have united in Confedera|cy, to give us a false Account of Christianity's <HI>im|mediately</HI> succeeding the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> of Christ, not only in <HI>Judea,</HI> but in all Parts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire.&mdash;That they do all agree in this Report, is what you must acknowledge: but how they came to unite in relating such Matters of Fact, which they all (upon this Supposition) must know to be false, is what no Man can possibly imagine.&mdash;If this was done <HI>after</HI> Christianity had obtain'd, it will follow, that a great Part of the World renounced the Re|ligion in which they had been educated, for the de|spised Doctrine of the Cross, and for a Life of continued Contempt, Misery, and Peril, without knowing the Reason why; and altogether ignorant of the Foundation upon which their new Religion was built. For, if they professed Christianity, before they knew the History of Christ's Life, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and before they had heard of the Apostle's Progress and miraculous Works, with the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost, which
<PB N="56" REF="005572_0063_0000000000000000">
accompanied their Ministry; they then all agreed to sacrifice their most valuable temporal Interests, and Multitudes of them endured the most terrible Deaths, in a Cause which they knew nothing about, and none of them knew any Manner of Reason why they should do so.&mdash;That is, in plain English, a great Part of the World run mad at once, most unaccountably; and from these mad Men, Christianity is descended down to the present Time.</P>
<P>It may be further observ'd, that upon the Suppo|sition before us, it will also follow, that in whatever distant Age from these pretended Facts, this Histo|ry was palm'd upon the World, <HI>All Men at once</HI> must be perswaded to believe for <HI>Truth,</HI> what they knew to be <HI>false.</HI>&mdash;These Histories declare, that they were written by the Apostles and immediate Disciples of our Lord, that the Authors of these Histories did propagate the Gospel through the World, did send these Writings to the Churches, to be kept in their Hands, as the Rule of their Lives, and the Directory of their Conduct; and that in Fact, Multitudes of the several Nations were prose|lyted unto, and baptised into the Faith of Christi|anity.&mdash;Now was it possible, at any Time whatso|ever, after those pretended Facts, that these Nations could be ignorant, whether these Books and this Religion were handed down to them by their Proge|nitors? Could not every one of the Nations, who are in these Books said to be converted to Chri|stianity, at once conclude that they had never heard any Thing of this Nature before; and therefore, that these Histories were all false and spurious; and
<PB N="57" REF="005572_0064_0000000000000000">
consequently not worthy of the least Notice?&mdash;Is it possible, that the World should agree to ven|ture both Time and Eternity upon such a known Falshood? Could all the World at once be gulled by such gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and open Forgery and Deceit?&mdash;In a Word, these Books were many of them directed to large Societies of Men, in different Parts of the World, were early translated into divers Languages, in which they are still extant, have been publickly kept and publickly read in the Churches, have been appealed to by all Parties and Sects; and never called in Question as a Forgery, either by the Friends or Enemies of the Christian Cause.&mdash;All these Things put together, we have as much Certainty, that these Histories are not, cannot be Forgery or Imposture, as we can have of any Thing whatsoever, not immediately open to our Senses.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, let us sum up this Evidence; and see what the Conclusion must be.</P>
<P>All Mankind must own, that if the History of these Facts be true; if the Lord Jesus Christ did perform so many astonishing Miracles for so long a Time together, in Justification of his divine Missi|on; If he did himself rise from the dead, com|mission his Apostles to their Work, endow them with the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost, and empower them, by the Imposition of their Hands, to communicate the same miraculous Gifts to others, here was certainly the greatest Interposition of Hea|ven in Favour of the Christian Institution, that can possibly be imagined or conceived.&mdash;The Power and Veracity of God himself were at Stake in this Cause: for they were both appealed to, in Confir|mation
<PB N="58" REF="005572_0065_0000000000000000">
of the Truth; and both in the most ama|zing Manner display'd, in Answer to that Appeal.&mdash;All Doubting in this Case is therefore a Calling in Question the Truth and Faithfulness of God himself, as well his Power.</P>
<P>If this History be not true, then all the known Laws of Nature were changed: All the Motives and Incentives to human Actions, that ever had ob|tain'd in the World, have been intirely inverted: The wickedest Men in the World have taken the greatest Pains, and endured the greatest Hardship and Misery, to invent, practise, and propagate the most holy Religion that ever was: and not only the Apostles and first Preachers of the Gospel, but whole Nations of Men, and all Sorts of Men, Chri|stian, Jew, and Pagan, were (no Body can imagine how or why) confederated to propagate a known Cheat, against their own Honour, Interest and Safe|ty: and Multitudes of Men, without any Prospect of Advantage here or hereafter, were brought most constantly and tenaciously to profess what they knew to be false, to exchange all the Comforts and Pleasures of Life for Shame and Contempt, for Ban|ishments, Scourgings, Imprisonments, and Death; in a Word, voluntarily to expose themselves to be hated both of God and Man, and that without any known Motive whatsoever.&mdash;This must be allow'd, or else you must allow, that no Man ever was, or ever can be certain of any Thing; as is more parti|cularly consider'd above.</P>
<P>There now remains one of these three Things a necessary Conclusion from what has been said; Ei|ther (1) That these Consequences may be justified;
<PB N="59" REF="005572_0066_0000000000000000">
Or (2) That they are not regularly deduced from the Premises; Or (3) That the Christian Religion is true, and of divine Authority.&mdash;I am perswaded, you'll not assume either of the two former of these Conclusions: the latter therefore forces it self upon you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the Direction given in your last, I shall use the greatest Freedom in my Answer, and laying aside all Reserves, shall presume on your Candour.</P>
<P>You <Q><HI>can't see</HI> (you tell me) <HI>how these Arguments of mine for the Truth of Christianity, can admit of a rational and consistent Answer.</HI></Q> How then can you be, but <HI>"almost perswaded to be a Christian"?</HI> How can you want <Q><HI>some general and easy Directi|ons, how to get rid of those Doubts, which still hang upon your Mind, from the various Difficulties which are continually casting themselves in your

Way?</HI></Q> Do you deal thus with your self in other Cases, of infinitely less Importance? Do you har|rass your Mind with Doubts about other Things which are clearly evident to you, only because you meet with some Difficulties which you cannot readi|ly solve?&mdash;This were the Way to down-right Scep|ticism, in every Thing which falls under your Con|sideration, whether natural or moral. And at this Rate, you may call into Question your own Being and all your rational Powers; as well as every Thing you see, hear, or feel. For I dare say, there are Difficulties enough in any or all of these, to puzzle the most sagacious Philosopher that ever breathed; and to nonplus the Inquiries of all the Men in the World.</P>
<P>The Question before you is, Whether the Facts upon which the Evidence of Christianity depends, are clearly proved, and necessarily true? If so, there certainly must be some Way to solve all those Dif|ficulties, whether you have found out the Method to do it or not.&mdash;You should likewise consider, that it's of no Importance to the Safety of your Soul, whether you are, or are not, capable to obviate all the Objections which fall in your Way: but it is of eternal Importance, that you build on a <HI>sure Foundation;</HI> and that you <HI>believe in the only begotten Son of God.</HI>&mdash;This then should be your Method in the Case before you. First, see to your <HI>Foundation;</HI> examine throughly, seriously and impartially, whe|ther the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity be such, that you have Reason to believe it; and that it would be unreasonable, not to believe it true. And then whatever Difficulties may occur, don't dig

The Cause will bear the strictest Scrutiny, the severest Trial. And you can hardly imagine any Difficulty, but what has been clearly and judiciously resolved, by one or other of the late Defenders of this glori|ous Cause.&mdash;But are you convinced, that <HI>the Arguments to prove the Truth of Christianity, admit of no rational Answer?</HI> Take then the Apostle's Advice, in all the further Inquiries you shall make, to <HI>hold fast the Beginning of your Confidence, stedfast unto the End.</HI></P>
<P>This then is Part of that general Advice I would give you, that you may get rid of those Doubts which still hang upon your Mind.&mdash;Follow it, and it will at least lessen your Difficulties, and may make your Way plain before you.&mdash;But this is not the prin|cipal Direction, necessary to be taken in this Case. It's of special Consequence, to see to it, that you <HI>experience the Power of Christianity in your own Heart.</HI>&mdash;Reject this Advice; and it is impossible, that you should be <HI>rooted and built up in Christ, and established in the Faith.</HI> But comply with it; and it is impossible, that Hell and Earth can finally subvert your Faith, and separate between Christ and your Soul.&mdash;By this Means, this great Affair will be no

longer with you a Matter of mere Speculation, or empty Opinion, but convincing Experience: and Nothing, but your Imperfections and Temptations, can ever make you hesitate about the <HI>Truth</HI> of those Things, which you sensibly and continually feel the <HI>Influence</HI> of, upon all the Powers and Faculties of your Mind.&mdash;By this you will have <HI>the Witness in your self,</HI> a Transcript of the Gospel upon your Heart, such a Transcript as will answer to the Original, like as the Impress upon the Wax, to the Signet; or as a well-drawn Picture, to the Lineaments of the Face, from whence it was taken.&mdash;By this have Multitudes of Souls been established in the Faith, who have never been able critically to examine the external Evidence, upon which Christianity is foun|ded.&mdash;They have not been able to dispute for Christ: but they have dared to die for him.&mdash;They have found the Image of God imprinted on their Souls, by the Gospel of God our Saviour: and therefore could not doubt the Power of that Cause, which had produced so glorious an Effect upon them.&mdash;Make the Experiment, Sir; and you'll be forc'd to acknowledge the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be indeed your Saviour, when you feel that he hath actually saved you.</P>
<P>Let me therefore set before you some of the <HI>Marks</HI> given of a real <HI>Christian,</HI> in the New-Testa|ment; that when you come to discover the Linea|ments of this divine Image upon your Soul, you may know the Cause from the Effect. In doing this, I shall not descend into all the minute Parti|culars of the Christian's Character: but only set before you a few of the most plain and intelligible
<PB N="63" REF="005572_0070_0000000000000000">
Marks, by which a Christian indeed may be distin|guished from all others; and by which he may most clearly discern, that Christ is a Saviour indeed.</P>
<P>And first, the most general Mark, by which this may be known, is, that <HI>if any Man be in Christ, he is a new Creature; old Things are passed away; be|hold, all Things are become new.</HI> (2 Cor. v. 17.) That he is <HI>renewed in the Spirit of his Mind;</HI> and that he <HI>puts on the new Man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI> (Eph. iv. 23, 24.)&mdash;Here, you may see, is represented a very remarkable and distinguishing Change of State; a Change, which may be known by those who have had the blessed Experience; and a Change, that has been felt by all those, and none but those, who are Christians indeed.&mdash;Could you then find this blessed Effect of your committing your Soul and your eter|nal Interests into the Hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all the Powers, Passions and Appetites of your Soul are renewed, you could not doubt the Author of the wonderful Change.&mdash;You must own it to be from Him, that you are brought to hate what you before loved; and to love what you be|fore hated. Can you help but acknowledge this, when you find, that the Thoughts and Dispositions of your Mind are <HI>new;</HI> and the chief Subjects of your Care and Meditation are the <HI>Things unseen and eter|nal:</HI> That the Desires and Affections of your Soul are <HI>new;</HI> and placed <HI>upon the Things that are above, where Christ Jesus sits at the right Hand of God:</HI> That your Views and Apprehensions of your self are <HI>new;</HI> and your haughty and selfish Imaginati|ons are changed, to <HI>a humble and contrite Spirit, that
<PB N="64" REF="005572_0071_0000000000000000">
trembles at God's Word:</HI> That your Confidence and Dependance is <HI>new;</HI> and instead of depending upon your good Attainments, Purposes, Promises, Reformations, or Duties, you are endeavouring to <HI>be found in Christ Jesus, not having on your own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</HI> That your Joys and Satisfacti|ons are <HI>new;</HI> and instead of rejoicing in your tem|poral and sensual Acquisitions, you <HI>rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh.</HI> That the Objects of your Love and Complacency are <HI>new;</HI> and instead of loving the World and your Idols, you esteem <HI>God's Favour to be Life,</HI> and his <HI>Loving|kindness to be better than Life;</HI> and instead of lo|ving the Company of worldly and sensual Persons, you have your only Delight and Complacency in Men of serious vital Piety; and have this Evidence that <HI>you are passed from Death to Life, that you love the Brethren.</HI> That your Appetites and Passions are <HI>new;</HI> and instead of those boundless Desires you were before acted by, you are brought into a humble Subjection to the Will of God; and instead of those turbulent Passions which before had the Ascendant, you experience the blessed Fruits of the Spirit, which are <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance.</HI>&mdash;And to sum up all, that your Conversation is <HI>new;</HI> and that you live a Life of Holiness towards God; and of Righ|teousness, Charity, and Beneficence towards Men; endeavouring to fill up every Station, Relation, and Capacity of Life with Duty; and striving to have your whole Conversation as <HI>becomes the Gospel of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="005572_0072_0000000000000000">This, Sir, is a brief Summary of the true <HI>Christian Character.</HI> This the <HI>Salvation</HI> (in its moral View) which our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> bestows in this World, upon all his sincere Followers.&mdash;No Man ever fail'd of obtaining this, who by Faith unfeigned brought his Soul to Christ, and depended upon him, for his sanctifying renewing Influences.</P>
<P>Now Secondly, Another Thing which all true Christians experience, and none but they, is the spi|ritual <HI>Warfare.</HI> They have a Warfare with their remaining Corruptions. <HI>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit; and the Spirit against the Flesh.</HI> (Gal. v. 17.) And <HI>they see another Law in their Members, warring against the Law of their Minds,</HI> in order <HI>to bring them into Captivity, to the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> (Rom. vii. 23.) They have still so many Imperfections remaining in their Hearts, in their Duties, and in their Conversations, as make them <HI>groan, being bur|then'd;</HI> and cry out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI>&mdash;When therefore you are heartily engaged in this War, and feel in your self that you are continually led on to Victory, can you doubt, <HI>who</HI> it is that ap|proves himself the <HI>Captain of your Salvation?</HI>&mdash;Can you doubt this, when you sensibly feel in your self a Hatred to all Sin, without any Reserve, even to those Sins which by Constitution, or Custom, are so nearly and intimately united to your Affections, as to be|come your Members, even a right Hand, a right Foot or a right Eye?&mdash;Can you doubt this, when you feel that you even <HI>hate vain Thoughts;</HI> and that the Irregularities of your Hearts and Affections, as well as of your outward Conduct, are Matter of your continual Grief and Burden: what you continually
<PB N="66" REF="005572_0073_0000000000000000">
watch, and pray, and strive against?&mdash;Can you doubt this, when it's your constant Experience, that there is Nothing more grievous to you, Nothing more contrary to the governing Desires of your Soul, than the Prevalence of these Corruptions, and the Deadness, Formality and Distractions, which accom|pany your holy Duties; and when you experience that it is your most ardent and impatient Pursuit, to gain further Victory over the Imperfections of your Heart and Life; and to obtain more uninter|rupted Communion with God, in your religious Approaches to him?&mdash;Or, to sum up all in a Word, can this be doubted, when (under the sharpest Con|flict, you can meet with from this Quarter) you are able sincerely to say, that though <HI>when you would do Good, Evil is present with you;</HI> yet you <HI>delight in the Law of the Lord, after the inward Man?</HI></P>
<P>You must, beside this intestine War, have the Trial of another Campaign. You will find Ene|mies from without, as well as within, to main|tain a continual Conflict with. <HI>For we wrestle not against Flesh and Blood only, but against Principalities, against Powers, against the Rulers of the Darkness of this World; and against spiritual Wickednesses in high Places.</HI> (Eph. 6. 12.)&mdash;This is what you have pro|bably had no Experience of. A Prisoner in the Hands of his Enemies, led Captive by them at their Pleasure, has no Acquaintance with the Progress of Wars and Conflicts, Battles and Sieges; makes no Attempts for Victory and Triumph: But submits to the Injunctions of his Conquerors; and the more cheerful his Submission, the more Ease and Comfort he will find.&mdash; This you must acknowledge to be eminently true of such who without Opposition,
<PB N="67" REF="005572_0074_0000000000000000">
resign themselves voluntary Prisoners into their Ene|mies Hands; as all careless and secure Sinners do into the Hands of Sin and Satan.&mdash;But when once Per|sons come to be, in good Earnest, engaged in the Cause of Christ, what violent Opposition do they meet with? What dreadful Temptations do they often encounter, which carry their own Evidence with them, from what Quarter they come?&mdash;This I warn you of beforehand, that when you come to the Experience, you may not be discouraged; but established in the Faith of that Revelation, which you find experimentally true.</P>
<P>How frequently are Christians indeed called into this Field of Battle? How frequently are they as|saulted with most violent and impetuous Temptati|ons, which will follow and hurry them, and some|times foil them, notwithstanding all their good De|sires, godly Resolutions, and most active Endeavours after Holiness?&mdash;What horrendous blasphemous Thoughts are often injected into the Minds of such, which though the greatest Burthen and Abhorrence of their distressed Souls, yet follow and haunt them wherever they go, and whatever they do, and espe|cially at the Seasons of their nearest Approaches to God?&mdash;What doubting Apprehensions, what subtil surprizing Reasonings, will be darted into the Minds of some, even the most establish'd Christians, against the very Being of God; and the Truth of Christi|anity, notwithstanding their highest rational Convic|tion, and fullest Satisfaction of the Truth of these great Fundamentals of Religion?&mdash;What horrible and amazing Dispositions and Affections will seem to arise in the Minds of some of the most devout and heavenly Persons in the World; who, in the dread|ful
<PB N="68" REF="005572_0075_0000000000000000">
Conflict, are sometimes made to roar by Reason of the Disquietness of their Hearts?&mdash;What distres|sing Darkness, Dejections, and Despondings will some Christians be exercised with, after clear and satisfying Evidences of God's Favour, against all the comforting Considerations which can be proposed; and not|withstanding all the former Manifestations of the Love of God to their Souls?&mdash;And do not these, and such like <HI>fiery Darts of the wicked One,</HI> as clear|ly discover the Agency of <HI>Satan,</HI> as if we saw him make his Attacks in a visible Appearance?</P>
<P>I'm sensible, that many of these Temptations are ordinarily imputed to <HI>bodily</HI> Disease; because Satan frequently makes the fiercest Attacks upon the weakest Walls, where there is the greatest Prospect of Success&mdash;But though bodily Disorder may expose us to Darkness of every Kind, yet what Blasphemy can there be in the Spleen? How came Infidelity by a Lodging in the Humors of the Body? Or how can any disordered Temperature of the Body produce in the Mind (contrary to the habitual Bent and Biass of the renewed Soul) such fierce impetuous and irresistable Blasphemies against the glorious God, and the bless|ed Redeemer of the World? If this be only from bodily Disease, how comes it to pass, that many Persons of vigorous Health of Body, have met with the same distressing Trials?&mdash;Herein then the Truth of Christianity is confirmed by <HI>Experience,</HI> when the Christian meets with the very same Trials, which the <HI>Scripture</HI> forewarns him of: and the Fierceness of the Combat may not only establish him in the Faith, but strengthen his Hopes of Victory. He sees the divine Original of the Christian Institution, by the Enmity and Opposition of the infernal Powers against
<PB N="69" REF="005572_0076_0000000000000000">
it. He feels the Warfare just such as the Scriptures describe: and may therefore conclude, that he has no Temptation but what is common to Men; and may conside in the Captain of his Salvation, that he is leading him on to Victory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Another Instance, wherein the Truth of Christianity is brought to be a Matter of sensible Experience, is the <HI>Comfort, Peace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> of a reli|gious Life. Our blessed Lord has told us, that <HI>his Yoke is easy, and his Burthen Light.</HI> (Mat. xi. 30.) <HI>Peace he leaves with</HI> his Disciples, <HI>his Peace he gives unto them,</HI> and this in a Manner which the <HI>World</HI> cannot given. (Joh. xiv. 27.) And the Apostle represents Christians, as <HI>rejoicing in Christ Jesus, with|out Confidence in the Flesh</HI> (Phil. iii. 3.) and as having <HI>the Love of God shed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given unto them.</HI> (Rom. v. 5.)&mdash;Now what Doubt can remain in the Heart of a Christian, of the Truth and Faithfulness of these Promises, when he feels them actually fulfilled unto him; when he sensibly feels, that Christ doth not <HI>leave him comfortless,</HI> but <HI>manifests himself to him, so as He doth not unto the World;</HI> and when he joy|fully feels <HI>the Spirit of God witnessing with his Spirit, that he is a Child of God?</HI></P>
<P>You may perhaps esteem this to be all Cant and Delusion, Enthusiasm or heated Imagination: But is it reasonable in a Man that was born blind, to con|clude, that because he himself has no Idea of Light and Colours, therefore no Man ever saw the Sun; but all Pretences of Delight from the beautiful Appear|ances of the Creation, are mere Chicanry and Deceit?</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, you'll quickly be led forward by the Spirit of God into these blessed Paths of Joy and
<PB N="70" REF="005572_0077_0000000000000000">
Peace: and then you'll need no other Argument, to convince you of these glorious Truths, than your own happy Experience.&mdash;Then with surprizing De|light, you'll be able to feel the Exercise of Faith in the Son of God; and to apply the gracious Pro|mise, that <HI>him who comes to Christ, he will in no wise cast out.</HI>&mdash;Then you'll feel a most humbling and Soul-abasing Sense of your own Vileness and Unwor|thiness; and with sacred Rapture, admire, adore and praise the Riches of that sovereign Grace, by which you are pluck'd out of the Hands of Sin and Infi|delity, and out of the Jaws of Death and Hell; and become <HI>accepted in the Beloved.</HI>&mdash;Then a Ray of (before unexperienced) Light will break into your Soul, and give you such a spiritual View of the divine Perfections, as you never before had, such a Discovery of redeeming Love, as will fill you with Wonder and Praise.&mdash; Then the World with all its empty Pageantry will vanish out of Sight; and you will be no longer emulous of the Riches and Gran|deur of the greatest Men in the World; nor of the Pleasures of the most sensual Epicure.&mdash;Your Soul will then be solaced with more pure and substantial Joys, with Delights more answerable to its Desires, and more satisfying to its Taste, than its possible it should find from any of the vain Amusements of Time and Sense.&mdash;Then you'll obtain such a sensi|ble and affecting Discovery of the future Glory, as will put your Soul upon the Wing; and excite your most ardent Desires after the more intimate and eternal Enjoyment of that blessed Hope.&mdash;In a Word, then <HI>the Light will shine out of Darkness, and give you the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> And if you
<PB N="71" REF="005572_0078_0000000000000000">
are favour'd with this delightful View, when you come to encounter the King of Terrors, you will be able to stand the Shock with Courage, with Com|fort and Joy (as I have seen many do) from a de|lightful Prospect of your future Inheritance; and breathe out your last Breath with that triumphant Song, <HI>O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Victory!</HI></P>
<P>It is true, this is not always the happy Frame of every sincere Christian.&mdash; We are here in a militant State, and must often meet with fore Conflicts from our spiritual Enemies, as was before observ'd: but when these more exalted Joys and Comforts are wanting, Believers have yet <HI>Meat to eat, which the World knows not of.</HI>&mdash;The Promises will still prove an <HI>Anchor</HI> for their Souls, to keep them <HI>sure</HI> and <HI>stedfast,</HI> in the most tempestuous Seasons.&mdash; They will find Delight and Comfort from the Ordinances of God; and at least find occasional Returns of sensible Communion with him, which will make them <HI>rejoice more than when Corn and Wine and Oyl increase.</HI>&mdash; And often, in the midst of their greatest Darkness, they will have sudden and surprizing Gleams of Light and Joy break into their Souls, by which they will <HI>before they are aware, become like the Chariots of Amminadib.</HI>&mdash;At least they will be able <HI>to look unto Jesus, as the Author and Finisher of their Faith;</HI> and comfort themselves by <HI>committing their Souls to him,</HI> and venturing their eternal Interests in his Hand.</P>
<P>The Scriptures speak much of these <HI>Sealings of the Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Earnest</HI> of our future Inheritance.&mdash;The Spirit of God helps his Children to sensible Experi|ence of their undoubted Truth and Reality; whereby
<PB N="72" REF="005572_0079_0000000000000000">
they are established in the Faith, strengthned for their spiritual Encounters, and supported under all the Dif|ficulties and Trials they meet with, in their Way to the future Inheritance.&mdash;How light soever you may make of what has been said, I hope (Sir) you will live to rejoice in the delightful Experience, as Thou|sands of others have done; and thereby find Oc|casion to say with them, <HI>We are Witnesses of these Things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, I may yet add another Instance, where|in the Truth of Christianity is made Matter of Ex|perience, which is the <HI>Manner</HI> how the great <HI>Change</HI> is wrought, and carried on, in the Heart of every sincere Christian.&mdash;There is, I confess, a vast Dif|ference, with Respect to a Variety of incidental <HI>Circumstances,</HI> in the Methods of the divine Opera|on, in turning Sinners from the Power of Satan to God: and yet the Scripture-Account of this Change, as to the <HI>Substance</HI> of it, is always found to be exactly verified in all those, who at adult Years are the happy Subjects of God's converting Grace.&mdash;This has been continually confirm'd, by the bles|sed Experience of the Children of God, in all the successive Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>How agreeably are we surprized, to see a careless and secure Sinner, who was going on in the Pursuit of his Lusts, harden'd against all the solemn Warn|ings, which he had continually receiv'd from the Word and Ordinances and Providences of God; and deaf to all the pathetick Admonitions of his godly Friends; to see such an one (I say) at once, by some ordinary Passage in a Sermon, in a Book, or in Con|versation, throughly <HI>awaken'd</HI> out of his Security,
<PB N="73" REF="005572_0080_0000000000000000">
and put upon a serious and lasting Inquiry, <HI>What he should do to be saved.</HI>&mdash;His Conscience can no more now, as at other Times, wear off the Impression; nor dare he return to his Mirth and Jollity, to his sensual and worldly Pursuits.&mdash;He can no more speak Peace to his Soul, from his general Hopes, or his good Designs; nor rest in any Thing short of an Interest in Christ.&mdash;Thus we see the Promise verified, that Christ would <HI>send the Comforter to con|vince the World of Sin;</HI> and find it most evidently true, that <HI>the Word of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged Sword.</HI>&mdash;We see a Change made, that no Means, no Endeavours could ever Effect, till a divine Power was exerted to bring it about.</P>
<P>How constantly does the throughly awakened Sinner find, by Experience, the Deficiency of all his <HI>legal</HI> Attempts, to quiet his Conscience, and to esta|blish his Hopes of the Favour of God?&mdash;He sees his Sins too great and numerous, to be expiated by his imperfect Performances.&mdash;He feels his corrupt Affections, Appetites and Passions too strong for his good Purposes and Resolutions.&mdash;He is deeply sen|sible of so much Defect and Impurity in the best of his religious Duties, as render them utterly unworthy the Acceptance of an infinitely pure and holy God.&mdash;He feels his Heart so hard, and his Affections so dead and carnal, that Nothing but an Almighty Power can quicken them.&mdash;He knows by Experi|ence, that he lies at Mercy; and that all his own Refuges, and all Endeavours in his own Strength to relieve his distressed Soul, are fruitless and vain.&mdash;He finds it indeed the Case of fallen Man, that Nothing but <HI>coming to Christ,</HI> with Faith in Him,
<PB N="74" REF="005572_0081_0000000000000000">
and Dependance upon him for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> can give <HI>Rest</HI> to his labouring and weary Soul.&mdash;True it is, there are some convinced Sin|ners that wear off their religious Impressions, and stop short of these Effects, which I have now de|scribed: but these Consequences are always found in all those whose Convictions are abiding and ef|fectual. By these they are always necessitated to fly for Refuge to Christ, and look to Him for that Life and Peace, which they can find no where else.&mdash;You will readily allow, that my Station puts me under the Advantage of a particular Acquaintance with the Circumstances of distressed Souls: and hav|ing conversed with very many under Convictions, from Time to Time, I have always found the above Observations exactly verified.</P>
<P>How surprizing is the <HI>Change,</HI> made in convinced Sinners, when a Ray of divine Light shines into their Souls; and enables them to act Faith in Christ, and to <HI>behold the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ!</HI>&mdash;Now these <HI>Mourners in Zion have appoint|ed unto them Beauty for Ashes, the Oyl of Joy for Mourning, and the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness, that they may be called Trees of Righ|teousness.</HI> From this Time, they become indeed <HI>new Creatures,</HI> in all spiritual Respects.&mdash;Their Dis|covery of the Excellency and Sufficiency of Christ, whereby they were enabled cheerfully to trust their eternal Interests in his Hands, proves a continued Source of <HI>Love</HI> to God and Man, and a Principle that constantly inclines them <HI>to live soberly, righte|ously, and godly in this present World.</HI>&mdash;We see this experimentally true, as the Scriptures represent it, that their <HI>Faith works by Love, purifies their Hearts,
<PB N="75" REF="005572_0082_0000000000000000">
and overcomes the World.</HI>&mdash;There are indeed some hypocritical Pretenders to Faith in Christ, in whom we don't find these Fruits and Effects of it: But then there are (through the Goodness of God) Num|bers of others, the Tenor of whose future Lives does fully evidence, that their Faith is sincere; and that it produces all the Effects which the Scriptures ascribe to it.</P>
<P>There is no Room to impute this Work to the irregular Sallies of an over-heated <HI>Imagination,</HI> when we see a thorough and lasting Change both of Heart and Life.&mdash;There is no Room to suppose, that <HI>En|thusiasm</HI> or <HI>Fanaticism</HI> can have any Hand in this Change, when we see the blessed Effects of Faith in Christ every Way answer the Description given there|of in the Gospel; and when the Believer visibly and in Reality is become a new Man, from the Time of his Receiving and Relying upon the Lord Jesus Christ, for Righteousness and Strength.</P>
<P>And as bad as the Times are, as stupid and unbe|lieving as the World in general appear, we have yet repeated Examples of the blessed Effects of Faith, which I have now described; and of the Ve|rification of that precious Truth, that <HI>to as many as receive the Lord Jesus Christ, to them is given Power to become the Children of God, even to them who be|lieve in his Name.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Sir, if you'll review what has been said, don't it evidently appear, that <HI>he who believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself,</HI> when he finds the same Change of Heart, the same spiritual Con|flicts, the same Joy, Peace, and Comfort of Soul, and all these wrought in the very same Way and Method, which the <HI>Scriptures</HI> so plainly and parti|cularly
<PB N="76" REF="005572_0083_0000000000000000">
describe?&mdash;Can I doubt of the Skill of that Physician, or the Efficacy of that Medicine, whereby I am recovered from a dangerous Disease, to Health and Comfort, exactly in the same Method, and by the same sensible and progressive Steps, as was foretold me?</P>
<P>And is not this Truth made most clearly evident, not only to the Persons themselves, but to all di|ligent <HI>Observers,</HI> when they find the same <HI>Experiences</HI> reported by all true Believers in Christ, and all the same external and visible <HI>Effects</HI> of their Faith, con|spicuous and open to every one's Observation, not in one or two Instances only, but in Thousands of those who profess to have had these Experiences?&mdash;As we must necessarily acknowledge the Skill of that Phy|sician, who effectually cures all that submit to his Directions and Applications: so are we constrain'd to acknowledge him for our Saviour, who in the very same Way and Manner, which he has proposed and promised, does actually and effectually save all those who believe in him, and in the Way of his Ap|pointments trust to him for Salvation.</P>
<P>In my former Letters, I have laid before you some of the <HI>external</HI> Evidences of Christianity: In this I have given you a very brief Sketch of those <HI>inter|nal</HI> Evidences, which serve to confirm and illustrate the same important Cause.&mdash; By the former, the Truth of the Christian Religion is laid open to the Understanding: by the latter it is made Matter of sensible Experience in the Heart.&mdash;That the glori|ous Redeemer may enable you to feel the Force of this Reasoning, to your unspeakable Comfort here and Happiness hereafter, is the Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. Wherein some Objections against the internal Evi|dences of Christianity, are consider'd and answer'd.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Don't wonder to find you prejudic'd against <Q><HI>the extravagant Claim to extraordinary Experiences in Religion, lately made by some who are evi|dently under enthusiastick Heats and Delusions.</HI></Q> But I can't see any Force at all in your Reasoning, that <Q><HI>Because there are many eminent Professors of late, who really have nothing in them but Heat and Shew, and yet make as high Pretensions to the divine Influences, and to special Experience of the Opera|tions of the Spirit of God in their Hearts, as any others can do; therefore all Pretences of that Kind may justly be suspected to flow from the same Cause, and to be the Offspring of a like irregular Fancy and heated Imagination.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Do you indeed think it just arguing, because <HI>some</HI> Men make vain and false Shews of what they really are not, that therefore <HI>all</HI> other Professors of Religion are Hypocrites, as well as they?&mdash;Will it follow, because some Men pretend to Literature which they have not, that therefore there are no Men of Learning in the World?&mdash;Your Discovery of false Pretenders to religious Experiences, does
<PB N="78" REF="005572_0085_0000000000000000">
indeed give you just Reason to presume, that <HI>some</HI> others <HI>may,</HI> but no Reason to conclude, that <HI>all</HI> others <HI>must,</HI> in the same Manner impose upon the World, by meer delusive Appearances.&mdash;If you have disco|ver'd any to be false and deceitful, in their Profession of religious Experiences, it must be because you see something in their <HI>Conduct,</HI> which contradicts their Profession. But what Reason does this give you, to suspect those in whose Conduct you see nothing which contradicts their Profession.&mdash;If you have Reason to conclude the <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> of the former Sort, from the Evidences which appear against them; you have also Reason to conclude the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of the latter Sort, from the Evidences which appear in their Favour, and which testify the Reality of the Change they profess.&mdash;If you have Ground to suspect the careless, the loose, the sensual Professor, because he is such: By the same Way of Reasoning, you have Ground to conclude in Favour of the se|rious, the watchful and mortified Professor of Reli|gion, because he is such.&mdash;If the licentious and pro|fane, the fraudulent and unjust, the censorious and uncharitable, the Despisers and Calumniators of their Brethren, are therefore to be suspected of a false Pre|tence to the divine Influences: By the same Argu|ment, they who are so changed as to become remar|kably holy and righteous, meek and humble, chari|table, benevolent and beneficent, have a just Claim to be esteemed sincere, and to be credited in their Profession of religious Experiences.&mdash;There are (through the Mercy of God) Numbers of such yet among us, all of whom have this Change in its vi|sible Effects obvious to the World: and though some of them may be doubtful of their own State,
<PB N="79" REF="005572_0086_0000000000000000">
yet all of them declare, that they have received all their Attainments from the Lord Jesus Christ; they have look'd to him, and depended upon him for them all; and have always found, that their Pro|gress in Piety towards God, and in Justice, Kindness, and Charity towards Men, has born Proportion to their chearful Dependance upon Christ for Righte|ousness and Strength.&mdash;If some Men are <HI>Liars,</HI> yet others are credible, and may be trusted, especi|ally when they give us undoubted Evidence of their Truth and Fidelity.&mdash;Even so in the present Case, if some Men are <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and evidence themselves to be such, we have no Reason from thence to sus|pect the Truth of others Profession and Experiences, whose wonderful Change of Life, and whole future Conversation, are a continual Testimony to the Sincerity of the Profession they make, and to the Credibility of the Experiences which they relate.</P>
<P>But it seems, you are especially prejudiced against religious Experiences, by the <Q><HI>irregular Fancy and heated Imagination,</HI></Q> which you have observ'd in some Pretenders to extraordinary Attainments in Re|ligion; from whence you seem to argue, that be|cause some of their <Q>pretended Experiences are extravagant Flights of a disturbed Brain, and evidently flow from Pride, Self-Esteem, and Un|charitableness towards others, and end in Faction, Division and Alienation of Affection,</Q> that there|fore, since <HI>some</HI> of their Pretences are manifestly false and Airy Imaginations, you have just Reason to conclude, that <HI>all</HI> the rest of their Pretences are of the same Sort, and flow from the same depraved Mind.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, Sir, this is one of the most plausible Objections, that ever I have heard of, against
<PB N="80" REF="005572_0087_0000000000000000">
the internal Evidences of Christianity.&mdash;And no Doubt, our grand Adversary the Devil has had an especial Hand in blowing up this false Fire, that he may turn away our Eyes from the Glory of the Lord arisen upon Zion.&mdash;No Doubt, <HI>Satan hath transformed himself into an Angel of Light,</HI> in the late extravagant Heats which have appeared in some Places, that so by overdoing, he might undo, and might bring Reproach on the wonderful Work of divine Grace, which has made such a glorious Pro|gress in these Parts of the World.&mdash; A Permission of these dreadful Delusions may be esteemed a just Judgment of God upon such as have remain'd <HI>care|less</HI> and <HI>secure</HI> in a remarkable Season of Grace, who have resisted the Calls of the Gospel, the Convicti|ons of their Consciences, and the Strivings of the Holy Spirit; that they might thereby be hardened in their Prejudices against vital and experimental Religion, and perhaps finally <HI>stumble</HI> and <HI>fall.</HI></P>
<P>But how plausible soever your Objection may be, your Reasoning is far from conclusive.&mdash; WhatIncon|sistency is there in the Supposal, that a true Convert may have some very false Apprehensions and Ima|ginations? that the same Person may have a sancti|fied Heart, and a confused Head? and that he may build upon the true Foundation, such <HI>Wood, Hay and Stubble,</HI> as <HI>must be burnt up?</HI>&mdash;Our blessed Saviour has undertaken to sanctify the Hearts of all those who sincerely trust in him: but has never promised to make them infallible in all their Conduct.&mdash;If therefore, from a Principle of Love to God, these Men should zealously endeavour to serve him, and yet through heated Imaginations, or erroneous Ap|prehensions of their Duty, in some Cases, they
<PB N="81" REF="005572_0088_0000000000000000">
should mistake their Way, and suppose that they are <HI>doing God good Service,</HI> when they are acting counter to the true Interests of Christ's Kingdom, what then? Is it any Absurdity, to suppose they may act from a right Principle, though in a wrong Manner?&mdash;The Error is in their Opinions; but not in their Wills. Their Hearts are engaged in God's Service, though their Heads mislead them.&mdash;They may have experienced a real Change (in the Manner described in my last Letter) though through Ignorance and Mistake, their Endeavours to serve God are in some Instances irregular and sinful.&mdash;They may have had real Experiences in true and vital Piety, at present though their Imagi|nations are imposed on by Enthusiasm, &amp; Delusion.&mdash;These Allowances may be made, and ought to be made, for those who hold fast the fundamental Principles of Christianity and practical Godliness; and for none but those&mdash;There ought to be such Allowances made for those; because there is No|thing in their Character inconsistent with true and vital Piety: Yet there ought not to be such Al|lowances made for any but those; because Christ has undertaken to lead his sincere Followers into all necessary Truth.&mdash;I think, I have good Reason to conclude, that the Case is truly, and in Fact, just as I have here described it, with Respect to Numbers of those, who have run into some of those, who have been con|vinced of and penitently bewailed those Mistakes, do yet (their former Irregularities notwithstanding) walk worthy their professed Experience of a saving Changes; and approve themselves holy, humble, and charitable Christians. And I have the more
<PB N="82" REF="005572_0089_0000000000000000">
Hopes of others, who have not yet been convin|ced of their Mistakes, upon Account of their having been seduced into these Errors, by such zealous Leaders, of whose Piety they have so great an Opinion.&mdash;But you'll perhaps inquire, what I can say for those <HI>Leaders,</HI> who have influenced o|thers to these irregular Heats? To which I must answer, that as far as I am acquainted with them, I have Reason for a much better Opinion of the Hearts of some of them, than of their Heads; and must <HI>bear them Witness, that they have a Zeal of God, tho' not</HI> in every Thing <HI>according to Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>But supposing, as you suppose, that <Q><HI>some of the chief of these Preachers were very wicked Men, who cloaked their evil</HI> Intentions <HI>under a Shew of Zeal and extraordinary Piety, the better to insure poor unwary Souls into their Delusions, to promote Divisions and Contentions in the Land, and to com|pass their covert Designs:</HI></Q> My Argument is, on this Supposal, so much the stronger. Herein the Power and Love of the great Redeemer are so much the more conspicuous, that he has out shot Satan with his own Bow; and overruled those At|tempts, for the Promotion of his ownKingdom and Interest, which were levelled against it.&mdash;Nothing is more visible, than that great Numbers of poor Sinners have been awakened; and brought to fly to Christ for Refuge. Nothing is more apparent, than that the Consequence of this has (in nume|rous Instances) been the Renovation of their Lives, and their Conversion from a careless, sinful, sensual Life, to a Life of Holiness, Righteousness, Kind|ness and Charity.&mdash;In these therefore the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is become glorious; what|ever cover'd Designs any of the Instruments were
<PB N="83" REF="005572_0090_0000000000000000">
acted by. If these <HI>preached Christ even of Envy and Strife, What then? notwithstanding every Way whe|ther in Pretence or in Truth, Christ was preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</HI>&mdash;It is re|markable, that the great <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Gospel, particularly touching the Misery of our natural State, the Necessity of an Interest in Christ, and the Way of Salvation by Faith in him, were preached by them all (whatever human Imaginations were mixed with them) and these had their Effect in a peculiar Manner. Our blessed Saviour has therein blessed his own Institutions; and accomplished the Designs of his Grace, whoever and whatever were the Instruments, by whom these glorious Effects have been produced. As far therefore as a sanc|tifying Change in the Hearts and Lives of Men has been effected, so far must we acknowledge this to be a Work of God; and a Display of the divine Power of our blessed Saviour.&mdash;The Mi|racles of divine Grace, which might be wrought by <HI>Judas,</HI> were as bright a Discovery of the Re|deemer's Power and Goodness, as those were which were wrought by the other Apostles.</P>
<P>But you tell me, that <Q><HI>many of these new Con|verts pretend to mighty Experiences of divine Im|pulses, Raptures, Extasies; and the like: But shew forth no moral Vertues, nor true Love either to God or Man.</HI></Q> Well, Sir, what follows from this? Are there not many others, who make no Preten|sion to such mighty Experiences of divine Impulses, Raptures, &amp;c. that do shew forth all moral Vir|tues; and have a true Love both to God and Man?&mdash;Is it a good Argument, that because there are <HI>some</HI> mere Enthusiasts, who pretend to such Experiences which the Scriptures do not make
<PB N="84" REF="005572_0091_0000000000000000">
the Character of true Christians, therefore they are <HI>all</HI> mere Enthusiasts, even who pretend to such Ex|periences as the Scriptures do make the Character of all true Christians? &mdash;What is Christianity con|cern'd with the Extasies and Heats of such Men as you speak of? Where are these extatical Heats described in the Gospel, as the Marks of the Chil|dren of God? Be their Experiences allow'd to be according to their Pretences, what follows from thence, but that if they have no moral Virtues, <HI>these Men's Religion is vain;</HI> It is all enthusiastical, unscriptural, and without any Foundation? &mdash;But then on the other Hand, the Experiences which I have before described, are such as the Scriptures do make the Marks and Characters of the Children of God: and many there are, that make no Pretences to divine Impulses, Raptures or Extasies, who profess to have had these Expe|riences, and justify their Profession, by living in <HI>the</HI> Love both of God and Man. Now, I pray, how are such concern'd in the Enthusiasm, of which you complain? Don't the Experiences of these witness for them, as much as the Experiences of the other witness against them? &mdash;Here is a visi|ble and effectual Change wrought in them (just such a Change as the Scriptures describe) by which they are brought into a Conformity to the divine Nature, and live worthy their Profession and Cha|racter.&mdash;Christ has Promis'd the <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit</HI> to his People, who depend upon him for it: and what greater Evidence can there be of the Faithfulness of the Promise, than to see and feel its Accomplishment?</P>
<P>But you further observe, that <Q>the Demeanor of many of these Pretenders to religious Expe|riences,
<PB N="85" REF="005572_0092_0000000000000000">
is directly contrary to that <HI>Morality, Beneficence</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> which are the Orna|ment and Glory of human Nature.</Q> &mdash;And is not this a strong Confirmation of my Argument? I appeal to you your self, Sir, whether you be not acquainted with many others, that pretend to the religious Experiences which I have described, who are the brightest Patterns of those Graces and Virtues, which are the Ornament and Glory of human Nature.&mdash;Here then is a plain and visible <HI>Criterion,</HI> by which it may be known whose Expe|riences are, and whose are not, from the Spirit of God.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q><HI>They are</HI> (you say) <HI>indeed converted, but it is to Pride and Vanity, to Self-Esteem and Self-Applause.</HI></Q>&mdash;But are there not many <HI>others,</HI> who are con|verted to deep Humility, self-loathing and self|condemning?</P>
<P><Q><HI>They are changed</HI> (you say) <HI>but it is to Bitterness, Reviling, Censuring, and judging their Neighbours, who are much better than they.</HI></Q>&mdash;I allow this Charge to be agreeable to their pretended Experi|ences: But then, don't you see (blessed be God, I am sure I have seen) many <HI>others</HI> changed to Meekness, Kindness and Love, and brought <HI>to es|teem others</HI> much <HI>better than themselves?</HI></P>
<P><Q>Their boasted Experiences (you add) <HI>only animate them to Divisions, Factions and Separations.</HI></Q> But is this the Case of <HI>all,</HI> who make a Profession of religious Experiences? No: we have Cause to be thankful, the Case is quite otherwise.</P>
<P><Q><HI>They are</HI> (you say) <HI>often elated with rapturous Joys and Exults, which seem to be the Product of Nothing but Self-Esteem, and an irregular beaten Imagination.</HI></Q> &mdash;Here you inquite, <Q><HI>Must I
<PB N="86" REF="005572_0093_0000000000000000">
esteem these to be the Joy of the Holy Ghost, of which your last Letter speaks? If not, how shall I know, that all Pretences of this Kind are not equally fictitious and imaginary?</HI></Q>&mdash;This (I confess) de|serves some Attention. For perhaps no one Thing has raised such Prejudices in the Minds of Men against spiritual and religious Experiences, as those Airy Raptures and causeless Exults, that in some Instances have been seen of late.</P>
<P>I would therefore observe to you, that your own Representation of those joyful Transports, of which you complain, is sufficient to distinguish them from <HI>those Joys of the Holy Ghost,</HI> of which I wrote to you.&mdash;You rightly observe, that these false Raptures are the Product of <HI>an exalted Imagination.</HI>&mdash;But you have no Room to conclude this to be the Case with Respect to those spiritual Joys and Comforts, of which I wrote in my last.&mdash;I have known a wretched despicable <HI>Beggar,</HI> cover'd with Raggs and Vermin, who imagin'd himself a <HI>King's</HI> Son; and expected to be treated accordingly: But how vain and ludicrous soever his Imaginati|ons were, I never thought it an Argument, that there are no <HI>King's Sons</HI> in the World. He might probably entertain more transporting Apprehen|sions of his imagin'd Royalty, than they who re|ally possess that Dignity, which he so vainly pre|tended to. But must these latter be rejected as vain Pretenders, because of the craz'd Imagination of such a miserable Vagary!</P>
<P>To apply this to the present Case, I readily al|low, that all those Joys and Comforts which flow from <HI>the Imagination only,</HI> are always but airy and chimerical, false and delusive.&mdash;Thus, for In|stance, some will rejoice and triumph, from only
<PB N="87" REF="005572_0094_0000000000000000">
<HI>imagining</HI> themselves Favourites of Heaven; some from being able to paint upon their <HI>Imaginations</HI> the Miracles, Sufferings, Resurrection, or Ascen|sion of Christ; some from an <HI>imaginary</HI> Idea of the final Appearing of Christ, and their own fu|ture Glory; and the like: yet all this while the poor Souls forget, that there is one Thing wanting, in Order to make their Joys <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>substan|tial;</HI> and that is <HI>good Evidence</HI> of their Interest in that Saviour, and his glorious Salvation, of which they entertain such pleasing Imaginations.&mdash;They who have this Evidence (in the Manner described in my last) have a substantial Foundation of Com|fort and Joy, from having that Salvation actually begun in their Souls, which is the Pledge and Ear|nest of their eternal Inheritance: while the others are like to find themselves as much deluded in their Expectation of future Happiness, as they are in the Foundation of their Hopes.</P>
<P>You further represent these rapturous Joys to be the Effect of <HI>Self-Esteem.</HI> And I readily ac|knowledge, that where it is so, it is always deceit|ful and vain. The divine Influences are always <HI>humbling</HI> to the Soul which enjoys them.&mdash;They therefore are horribly profane, who impute their own Pride and Vanity to the Spirit of God: and consequently they are miserably deceiving them|selves, whose Joy and Comfort flows from an high Opinion of their imaginary Attainments in Reli|gion. <HI>They are a Smoke in God's Nostrils, who are saving, Stand by thy self, come not nigh me: for I am bolier than thou.</HI>&mdash;But then on the contrary, when the humble Soul is lying at God's Foot, self-abasing and self-condemning, adoring the infinite Riches of God's free Grace to such a vile, worth|less
<PB N="88" REF="005572_0095_0000000000000000">
Worm; and <HI>rejoicing in Christ Jesus, without Confidence in the Flesh;</HI> these blessed Effects are worthy of the Spirit of God, by whom they are wrought.&mdash;And it is always true, that the Belie|ver's Sense of his own Vileness, Pollution and Unworthiness, bears Proportion to his joyful Evi|dences of the divine Favour.</P>
<P>You further object against the false Pretenders you mention, that <Q><HI>their Conduct don't justify their joyful Assurance.</HI></Q>&mdash;This is indeed a good Evi|dence against their high Pretensions to extraordi|nary Attainments in Religion.&mdash;For I believe, every Christian does certainly make the same Pro|gress in <HI>Holiness,</HI> as he does in well-grounded Comfort and Joy. The Objection therefore can no Ways affect those with whom this is an expe|rienced Truth; who always find, that their Hope and Joy quicken them in their spiritual Course, invigorate their Duties, and enlarge their Desires and Endeavours after a Conformity to the whole Will of God.</P>
<P>I must now leave this Matter to your own Re|flections; you your self must judge the Validity of your Exceptions.&mdash;Compare the Picture you have drawn of some empty, <HI>enthusiastical</HI> Preten|ders to religious Experiences, with the Descrip|tion I have given you of those, who have <HI>indeed</HI> experienced the divine Life: and consider whe|ther there be any real <HI>Similitude,</HI> in any Marks and Lineaments of their Countenances.&mdash;In <HI>those</HI> is found Pride and Petulance: but in <HI>these,</HI> Hu|mility and Self-Abasement.&mdash;In <HI>those,</HI> Censori|ousness and Uncharitableness are the distinguish|ing Characters: in <HI>those,</HI> a charitable preferring others to themselves.&mdash;<HI>There</HI> you see Schism,
<PB N="89" REF="005572_0096_0000000000000000">
Contention, and Faction: <HI>Here</HI> is Kindness, Peace, and brotherly Love.&mdash;<HI>There</HI> imaginary Im|pulse, but <HI>here</HI> the Word of God alone, is con|sider'd as the Rule of Life.
&mdash;<HI>There</HI> Joy and Comfort are consider'd as the Evidence of a good State: <HI>Here</HI> they are consider'd as the Fruit of good Evidence of Faith in Christ, and of a renewed Nature.&mdash;<HI>There</HI> Religion is supposed to consist in Rapture and Extasy: <HI>Here</HI> in spiri|tual Affections, and in a heavenly Conversation.&mdash;<HI>There</HI> we find Men building their Hope and Comfort upon their imaginary Attainments: But <HI>here</HI> we find them making Christ Jesus their only Refuge and Hope.&mdash;And to sum up all in a Word, <HI>There</HI> are high Pretences to religious Experiences without the Fruits of Holiness: But <HI>here</HI> the happy Effects of this Change appear in the Heart and Life; and justify the Profession to be true, and the Experiences to be indeed what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are pre|tended to be.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there is Nothing more cer|tain, than that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> do represent what I have set before you, as the real Characters of the Children of God.&mdash;It is equally certain, that as an actual Experience of the <HI>renewing Change</HI> is, from the Nature of Things, absolutely necessary to Salvation, so a Sense of this Change wrought in us is requisite to true Peace and Comfort: And there can be Nothing but a Want of due <HI>Atten|tion</HI> to this Experience, or Ignorance of the <HI>Qua|lity</HI> of that Change they have sensibly experien|ced, which keeps <HI>Believers</HI> in Darkness and Doubts about their State.&mdash;The Subjects of this Work can therefore have no greater Evidence that it is <HI>from God,</HI> than sensibly to feel that it every. Way
<PB N="90" REF="005572_0097_0000000000000000">
answers the original Description.&mdash;What grea|ter Evidence can they have of the Truth of the Gospel, than a <HI>Sensible Experience</HI> of the Reality of its Doctrines, and the Truth of its Promises, by this wonderful Work of Grace in their own Hearts, which so visibly carries the divine Sig|nature both in its Operation and Effects; and is so manifestly distinguished from all false Appear|ances and Pretences?&mdash;For my own Part, I can|not but look upon the <HI>irregular Heats,</HI> you speak of, as affording some convincing Evidence in Fa|vour of the Cause I am pleading.&mdash;These Things are <HI>foretold</HI> in the Scriptures.&mdash;By these Things <HI>Satan</HI> is endeavouring to support his own King|dom, as we may reasonably expect he would do. He knows, that he is most likely to play the surest Game, when he <HI>transforms himself into an Angel of Light.</HI>&mdash;And these false Appearances serve for a <HI>Foil,</HI> to discover the greater Lustre in a true and real Work of divine Grace.</P>
<P>The only <HI>Objection</HI> against all this, which I can foresee, is that I am philosophizing upon the <HI>golden Tooth,</HI> and that the Persons I am characterizing, exist no where, save in my Descriptions of them.&mdash;But I need add no more to what I have said upon this already, than <HI>my Attestation,</HI> that I have the Comfort of an inward and intimate Acquain|tance with considerably Numbers of such as those whose I have described.&mdash;And if you (Sir) would seek out <HI>such</HI> for your chosen Companions, your Objections would die of themselves; and the Ar|gument I have insisted upon, would appear in its proper Light and Strength.</P>
<P>I know not what more can be needful to be added upon this Subject, but my hearty Prayers,
<PB N="91" REF="005572_0098_0000000000000000">

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Wherein the Doctrine of GOD's Sovereign Grace is vindicated; and some Exceptions against it consider'd and answered.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU can't imagine how much Comfort you have minister'd to me by your last. I greatly rejoice to hear, that <Q><HI>the more strictly you examine the Cause, the greater Evidence you find of the undoubted Truth and Certainty of the Christian Religion:</HI></Q> But that <Q><HI>you are filled with Con|fusion, to think how long you have lived at a Dis|tance from that blessed Saviour, who has wrought out such a glorious Redemption for us.</HI></Q> And I am not at all surprised, to hear you complain, That <Q><HI>you cannot entertain clear Apprehensions of if any Discourse of experimental Religion:</HI></Q> That <Q><HI>although your last Objections are silenc'd, there are
<PB N="92" REF="005572_0099_0000000000000000">
others which fill your Mind with greater Difficulty; and are of much greater Importance, if I have given you a just View of the Case.</HI></Q> And that <Q><HI>you cannot tell how you can ever be brought to a feeling Sense of the Doctrines of sovereign Grace, which I so much insist on, while they appear to you so inconsistent with Truth, and so unreasonable.</HI></Q>&mdash;I am not (I say) surprised at this; for we are naturally prejudiced against these Doctrines; and are not easily brought to receive them, by Reason of the strong Biass there is upon our Minds to the con|trary Principles.&mdash;I shall therefore endeavour to consider your several Objections; and how strong and plausible soever they may appear, I don't despair of giving you Satisfaction.</P>
<P>You object, that <Q><HI>if we are of ourselves capable of no qualifying Conditions of the divine Favour, or (to use my own Words) if we must feel that we lie at Mercy, and that all our own Refuges, and all our Endeavours in our own Strength to relieve our distressed Souls, are fruitless and vain, you can't tell to what Purpose any of our Endeavours are; or what Good it will do us to use any Means at all for our Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Order to a clear Solution of this Difficulty, it seems needful to convince you, that this lost, impotent, deplorable State is the Case in <HI>Fact,</HI> of every unrenewed Sinner, whatever Objections we may frame in our Minds against it: and therefore it is necessary, that he should <HI>sensibly perceive</HI> the Case to be as it truly is.&mdash;And then, it will be proper to shew you, that the <HI>Consequence</HI> you draw from this Doctrine is <HI>unjust;</HI> and even directly contrary to the Improvement you ought to make of it.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="005572_0100_0000000000000000">I begin with the first of these; and shall endea|vour to convince you, that <HI>Man is indeed in such a lost and helpless State,</HI> that he lies at <HI>meer Mercy;</HI> and cannot bring himself into a Claim to the divine Favour, by any Power or Ability of his own.&mdash;I shall not run into the scholastick Controverfies and subtil Distinctions, with which this Doctrine has been clouded by many of our wrangling Disputers: but shall endeavour to set it in the most plain, easy and practical Light, that I am able.</P>
<P>I think, you must readily grant, that you cannot make an <HI>Atonement</HI> for your Sins, by any Perfor|mances within your Power.&mdash;You are (Sir) to con|sider your self as a <HI>Sinner,</HI> as a Criminal and De|linquent in the Sight of God.&mdash;Your <HI>Nature</HI> is corrupt and defiled.&mdash;Your actual Transgressions of the Law of God have been very numerous; and perhaps some of them attended with special Aggravations.&mdash;All your Sins are directly repug|nant to the Perfections of the divine Nature; and consequently offensive to a pure and holy God.&mdash;And what greatly increases the Difficulty and Dan|ger of your Case, is, that you are still continuing to act contrary to God in all you do, while your Nature is unrenewed; and while you are without a Principle of Love to God. (I am sure, you will pardon this Freedom; for it is necessary you should know the Disease, in Order to the Cure.)&mdash;Judge then your self, whether it can be supposed, that an omniscient Heart-searching God can be <HI>pleased</HI> with any, even the most devout of your overt Actions, when he knows that your <HI>Heart</HI> is estranged from him, and your <HI>Nature</HI> has no Conformity to him; but your Affections are glew'd to your several <HI>Idols.</HI>&mdash;How then can you be reconciled to God, by
<PB N="94" REF="005572_0101_0000000000000000">
of your own Performances and Attainments? Can you pay ten Thousand Talents, with less than Nothing? &mdash;Can you <HI>please</HI> God by <HI>offending</HI> him, as you do by the Obliquity of all your Duties, the De|fects of your best Devotions, and the sinful Affec|tions from whence they all flow?&mdash;Or can you have those unworthy Thoughts of an infinite, un|changeable God, as to hope you can make such Impressions upon his Affections, by acknowledg|ing your Offences, and imploring his Mercy, as to excite his Compassion and Sympathy; and to make your impure and unholy Nature agreeable to his infinite Purity and Holiness?&mdash;Can your insincere and hypocritical Duties (for such they are all at best, while they proceed from an <HI>unsanc|tified Heart</HI>) bring the glorious God to take Com|placency in what is directly contrary to his own Nature?&mdash;You cannot but see, that these Pro|posals are most unreasonable and absurd. One of these Things must certainly be true; either, first, that you have <HI>naturally</HI> whilst in an unrenewed State, a Principle of <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> to God: or secondly, that Works flowing from an <HI>impure</HI> Fountain, and from a Principle of Opposition and Alienation to God, are yet <HI>pleasing</HI> to God, will serve to appease him, and will entitle you to his Favour: or thirdly, that you cannot, by any Thing you do, have a Claim to God's Favour, until your Nature is renewed, and you can act from a Principle of Holiness and Love to God. I think, every Man's Experience will confute the <HI>first</HI> of these, who gives any Attention at all to the natural Dispositions of his own Soul: The <HI>second</HI> is altogether inconsistent both with the Nature of Things, and with the Nature of an infinitely

pure and holy God: and therefore the <HI>third</HI> is necessarily true.&mdash;It won't at all help the Case, to alledge in Barr of what is here said, that <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> has made an Atonement for us. For what is that <HI>to you,</HI> while you remain without an In|terest in him?&mdash;Did Christ purchase for you a Capacity to make an Atonement for your self?&mdash;Did he die, that God might be pleased with what is contrary to his own Nature; and paci|fied with such Duties as can be no better than impure Streams from a corrupt Fountain?</P>
<P>Let Reason sit Judge in the Case before us; and you must allow your Case to be as I have descri|bed it. And it is equally evident, that you have <HI>no Power to change your own Heart,</HI> and to produce in your self a new Principle of Love to God and Conformity to him, by any Endeavours of your own.&mdash;It is visible from what has been already said, that our Hearts and Affections must be re|newed and sanctified, before either our Persons or Services can be acceptable in the Sight of God. And which Way can this be compassed? If you take up <HI>Resolutions,</HI> these will no longer stand you in Stead, than the Principle of <HI>Fear,</HI> from which they proceed, is kept in Act.&mdash;If you execute these Resolutions in some external <HI>Reformations,</HI> this is but lopping off the Branches, while the Stock and the Root of the Tree are still alive; the Affections and Dispositions of the Soul being still the same.&mdash;If by Fear, or other selfish Mo|tive, you something restrain the present more sen|sible Exercise of your sinful <HI>Appetites</HI> or <HI>Passions,</HI> this is but damming up the Stream, and forcing it into another Channel; pull down the Dam, and it will run where it did before.&mdash;Certain it is,
<PB N="96" REF="005572_0103_0000000000000000">
that every Man naturally loves the <HI>World,</HI> and the Things of the World, the Objects of his sensual Ap|petites; and loves his Lusts and Idols, more than God: and it is equally certain, that whatever <HI>Re|straints</HI> he may sometimes put upon these Dispo|sitions, an omniscient Eye beholds the same <HI>Prin|ciple</HI> in him notwithstanding: and consequently he can never <HI>please</HI> God, till there be in this Respect a real and thorow <HI>Change</HI> wrought in all the Pow|ers of his Soul; such a Change as the Scriptures describe by a <HI>Translation from Darkness unto Light, from Death to Life, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</HI>&mdash;And to suppose, that any but.

<P>But I return, to consider your Objection more distinctly.&mdash;<Q><HI>The Scriptures</HI> (you tell me) <HI>promise, that he who seeks, shall find.</HI></Q>&mdash;But (Sir) do not the Scriptures also inform us, that <HI>many shall seek to enter in at the strait Gate, and shall not be able:</HI> that some <HI>ask, and receive not, because they ask amiss:</HI> And that he who does <HI>not ask in Faith, nothing wa|vering, must not think he shall receive any Thing of the Lord?</HI> &mdash;There is indeed a Promise to him who seeks in Faith and Sincerity: but what Claim can he have to that Promise, who has neither true Faith nor Sincerity?&mdash;Will <HI>mocking God,</HI> and <HI>flat|tering him</HI> with you Lips, while your <HI>Heart</HI> is e|stranged from him, intitle you to the Promise?</P>

<PB N="99" REF="005572_0106_0000000000000000">
seriously, whether a <HI>Sinner,</HI> who is dead in Trespasses and Sins, who is in a State of Rebelli|on against God, and therefore under the condem|ning Sentence of the Law, can any more atone for his Sins, or make a reasonable Plea for Grace and Pardon, than the <HI>Traitor</HI> aforesaid?&mdash;But were your Reasoning ever so just, it would afford you no Grounds of <HI>Comfort.</HI> For there never was, nor ever shall be any Man, that can fairly make this Plea in his own Favour; and truly say, he has <HI>done all he can,</HI> in the mortifying his Lusts, and in his Endeavours to serve God.

<P>You complain, that <Q><HI>the Arguments in the Book I sent you, don't give you Satisfaction </HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The true Scripture-Doctrine,</HI>&amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash;Well, I have here added some further Evidence, to what was there offered; and would now call upon you to consider, whether all these Things put toge|ther don't make it evident, that you lie at Mercy, and convince you of those Scripture-Truths, that <HI>it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, him in God that sheweth Mercy;</HI> and that God giv|eth his saving Grace only <HI>because it hath so seemed good in his Sight.</HI>&mdash;Consider, whether you can a|lone for past Sins by present Duties, by Duties which are so polluted by the Principle from which they flow: and which have so much Carnality, selfishness, Hypocrisy, and sinful Defects cleaving to them, that if the <HI>Iniquity of your mostholy</HI> Things be imputed, it must greatly increase the moral Distance
<PB N="100" REF="005572_0107_0000000000000000">
between God and you.&mdash;Consider, whether while you are under the Law, or Covenant of Works, you are capable not only to fulfil all its preceptive Demands, and so not further expose your self to its Curses; but also to do something towards ma|king Satisfaction to God's Justice for what you have already done amiss, and to merit his Favour.&mdash;Or consider, whether you have any Claim to God's Acceptance of your Person upon Christ's Account, without an Interest in him, and whilst condemn'd already by his own Mouth, and under the Wrath of God for your Unbelief.&mdash;Consider, whether you can have any Promise of Acceptance to plead, while you remain under the Curse, both of the Law and Gospel.&mdash;Consider, whether an omniscient and holy God can be either deluded or gratified with mere external Shews of Religion, when he knows you have an Heart in you that is far from Him.&mdash;Consider, whether you can ever make the Case better, by all your Endeavours to change your own Heart, and to create your self anew in Christ Jesus, any more than you can pro|duce a new World.&mdash;Consider, whether you dare venture your Eternity upon this Issue, that you sin|cerely do what you can to serve God; and whe|ther there be not such sinful Defects cleaving to your best Performances, as may justly condemn both you and them.&mdash;Consider again, whether if you should do all you can in the Service of God, you would do any Thing that would either fully come up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; or bear the least Proportion to that Salvation which the Gospel requires.&mdash;Consider once more, whether the glorious God has not an absolute Right to dis|pose of his own Favours, just how, when, and
<PB N="101" REF="005572_0108_0000000000000000">
where he pleases; and whether he has not assured us, that he will bestow his everlasting Mercy upon none but those who are really conformable to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if you while unregenerate can neither make Atonement for your past Sin and Guilt, nor come up to the Demands of the Law of Nature: If you can neither please God by your sinful Per|formances, nor, impose upon him by your hypo|critical Shews: If you run further in Debt by the Sin in your very Duties, in stead of paying any Things of the old Score: If you have no Claim to Acceptance on Christ's Account, without a special Interest in him; nor any Claim to the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, till you actually comply with the Terms of it: If both Law and Gospel condemn you in your present State; and nothing but Omnipotence can change your Heart, and make your State better: If God be a sovereign Donor of his own Favours; and you can have no Promise to plead, while you remain under the Curse and Wrath of God, and a Stranger to the Covenants of Promise: If even you your self must allow all these Things to be undoubted Truths, it must then be true, even to Demonstration, that (while in such a State) you are capable of no <HI>Qua|lifying Condition</HI> of the divine Favour; and had need therefore to feel that you <HI>lie at Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Head, if God himself may be believ'd in the Case, <HI>He will have Mercy upon whom be will have Mercy; and whom he will, he hardeneth.</HI> Rom. ix. 18.&mdash;'Tis <HI>not for our Sakes, that he</HI> be|stows Grace upon us. <HI>but for his holy Name's Sake,</HI> Ezek. xxxvi. 22, 31.&mdash;He <HI>Predestinates us unto the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ to himself, accor|ding
<PB N="102" REF="005572_0109_0000000000000000">
to the good Pleasure of his Will, to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us ac|cepted in the Beloved.</HI> Eph. i. 5, 6.&mdash;He acts in this Case according to his own sovereign Pleasure, as a <HI>Potter that hath Power over his Clay, to make one Vessel to Honour, and another to Dishonour;</HI> and we have no Liberty to <HI>reply against God:</HI> it is insuf|ferable Arrogance for <HI>the Thing formed to say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</HI> Rom. ix. 20, 21.&mdash;Sir, as you your self claim a Sovereignty in the Dispensation of your Favours, surely you won't dare to deny a like Sovereignty in the eternal God.&mdash;Believe it, the glorious God is a Sovereign Benefactor; and he will be acknow|ledged as such, by all that ever partake of his sa|ving Mercy.</P>
<P>And now I am prepar'd to shew you, that the <HI>Consequence</HI> which you draw from this Doctrine, is <HI>unjust;</HI> and even directly contrary to the Improve|ment you ought to make of it.</P>
<P>And the Reason I offer for this, is, that a reali|zing Belief of the Truth before us directly tends to bring most Glory to God; and most Safety, Comfort, and Happiness to your self.&mdash;It is easy to conceive how it conduceth most to God's <HI>Glory,</HI> for us to consider him as the Fountain and Foundation of all Grace and Mercy; and to consider all the Favours we enjoy or hope for, as flowing from the meer Goodness of his Nature; and not from any Motive or Inducement which we can possibly lay before him.&mdash;In this View of the Case we do that Honour to an infinite and e|ternal Being, as to suppose him a self-existent, independent, and immutable Sovereign: while, on the contrary, to imagine our selves capable by
<PB N="103" REF="005572_0110_0000000000000000">
any Thing we can do, to change his Purposes, engage his Affections, or excite and move his Compassions towards us, is to conceive him to be <HI>altogether such an one as our selves,</HI> liable to new Im|pressions from our Complaints or Persuasions, mu|table in his Affections, and dependant upon our Duties for the Exercise of his Grace.&mdash;And I leave it to you to judge, which of these Apprehensions are most worthy of that God, who is infinitely exalted above us; and is <HI>without any Variation or Shadow of turning.</HI> I leave it likewise to you to judge, which Principle is most likely to subserve our best Interests, that which does most Honour, or that which does the most Dishonour to God.</P>
<P>If we apply this to the present Case, I ask, In which Way can we find most Encouragement to seek or strive for Mercy? In which Way have we the best Prospect of Success? By entertaining false and dishonourable Conceptions of the divine Be|ing, and denying to God the Glory which is due to his Name? Or else by lying at the Foot of a Sovereign; and thereby ascribing to him the infinite Perfections of his excellent Nature?&mdash;Though in this latter Way, you can make no Change in God, you will nevertheless have the Evidence that he has made a Change in you, and a comfortable Prospect, that by bringing you to a Submission to his Sovereignty, he has a Design of special Favour to your Soul.</P>
<P>If we should yet further continue our View of this Case, it will appear, that a Submission to the mere sovereign Mercy of God is most conducive to <HI>your own Comfort, Safety, and Happiness.</HI>&mdash;This Consideration is a just Foundation of Comfort and Hope, in that it obviates the Darkness and Discou|ragements
<PB N="104" REF="005572_0111_0000000000000000">
that would otherwise arise, from a Sense of your Guilt and Unworthiness, and from your Impotence and unavoidable Infirmity and Im|perfection in the Service of God.&mdash;What Hope could you find from your Duties; when after your best Endeavours, you would see so much Deadness, Formality and Hypocrisy, in your highest Attain|ments?&mdash;What Hope from your Reformations; when you find so much Sin and Corruption gain|ing Ground against all your good Purposes and Resolutions? &mdash;What Hope from your good Af|fections, when so much Hardness of Heart, World|lymindedness, Sensuality, and carnal Dispositions are separating between God and you? &mdash;Can you quiet your Soul by imposing upon an omniscient God, with your vain Shews and flattering Pre|tences? No, Sir, if you have any true Discovery of your own <HI>Heart,</HI> these Considerations must con|tinually perplex and distress your Soul, with dis|tracting Fears and Despondencies, as long as you are thus <HI>compassing your self about with Sparks of your own kindling.</HI> For these Defects and Imper|fections will certainly accompany your best Re|solutions, Endeavours and Attainments.&mdash;But then, on the other Hand, if you lie at Mercy, and sub|mit to God as the sovereign Disposer of his own Favours, you have good Grounds of Encourage|ment and Hope.&mdash;Are your Sins great, and great|ly aggrav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed? The mercy of God exceeds them all.&mdash;Have you no agreeable Qualifications, to re|commend you to the Favour of God? Multitudes of others have found Mercy, who had no bet|ter Qualifications than you have.&mdash;Have you no special Promise to depend upon, as belonging to you, while in an unconverted State? Yet is
<PB N="105" REF="005572_0112_0000000000000000">
it not sufficient, that you have gracious Encou|ragement to leave all in the Hands of that Mer|cy, which infinitely exceeds your highest Appre|hensions or Imaginations?&mdash;Are you uncapable to come up to the Terms of Grace, proposed in the Gospel? There is yet Hope in God's omni|potent Mercy, that he will <HI>work in you both to will and to do, of his own good Pleasure.</HI> He has done it for Thousands of Sinners, no better than you.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, look around you; and see what Re|fuge you can possibly betake your self to.&mdash;You are in the Hands of <HI>Justice;</HI> and which Way can you make your Escape? If you attempt to fly <HI>from</HI> God, you perish: but if you fly <HI>to</HI> him, there is Hope.&mdash;He is <HI>Sovereign</HI> in the Donation of his Fa|vours; you have therefore as good a Prospect of obtaining Salvation (in the Use of appointed Means) as any unregenerate Person in the World.&mdash;Your Defects and Demerits need not be any Discouragement: For his Mercy triumphs over the Guilt and Unworthiness of the greatest Sin|ners.&mdash;Is it therefore not your greatest Safety to lie at his Foot, in the Way of his Appointments, where there is a blessed <HI>Hope set before you?</HI>&mdash;In this Way you have the infinite Mercy of God, the gracious Encouragements of the Gospel, the glorious Success of so many Thousands who have tried this Method, to animate your Diligence and Hope. And there is no other Way, in which you have any Encouragement to expect renewing Grace and pardoning saving Mercy.</P>
<P>Since you wholly depend upon God's free so|vereign Mercy, you should use the more diligent and earnest Application, in all the Ways of his Appointment, that you may obtain it.&mdash;Since you
<PB N="106" REF="005572_0113_0000000000000000">
must obtain Mercy of God, or perish, O with what Diligence and Importunity, with what Ardou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Soul, should you address the Throne of Grace, for Deliverance from your Guilt and Danger?&mdash;Since in a Way of Sovereignty, God is pleased to bestow his special Grace, with an Interest in his Son and his great Salvation, at what Time and by what Means it shall seem best in his Sight, you should therefore at all Times, and in the Use of all the Means of Grace, be <HI>Seeking the Lord, while He may be found, and calling upon Him while he is near.</HI></P>
<P>Can it be thought just Reasoning, that because you cannot help your self, and there is none but God can help you, it's therefore in vain to apply to him for Help? That because you have no Claim to his Favour, but sly at his Mercy, you will not therefore seek Mercy at his Hands?&mdash;Does not this, at the first View, appear contrary to all the Methods of Reasoning we should use in any other Case?&mdash;Can you promise your self Com|fort, from such Reasonings and such Conclusions as these, in your last expiring Moments, when your Soul is entring upon its eternal and unchan|geable State?</P>
<P>But you object, <Q><HI>If God in Sovereignty designs Mercy for us, we shall obtain it, whether we seek, or no: and if not, it's in vain to Strive.</HI></Q>&mdash;To this it's sufficient Answer, that God never does in So|vereignty appoint Salvation for any, in the final wilful Neglect of Gospel-Means.&mdash;He is sovereign in the Appointment of the Means, as well as of the End. The same glorious Sovereign, who as|sures us, it is <HI>not for our Sakes</HI> that he bestows his special Grace upon us, <HI>but for his own Name's Sake,</HI> does also let us know, that <HI>he will be inquired
<PB N="107" REF="005572_0114_0000000000000000">
of by the House of Israel, to do this for them.</HI>&mdash;Whence it follows, that if we have not a Heart to seek with earnest Diligence, for the gracious Influences of the Spirit of God, there is no Pro|spect we shall ever obtain. For God will make us feel the Want of his Mercy, and will make us esteem his Salvation worthy of our Care and Pains; or leave us to the unhappy Effects of our own Madness and Folly.&mdash;But if we have Hearts given us, to be humbly and earnestly attending upon the Means of Grace, it is an encouraging Sign, that he who has excited our Diligence, intends to crown it with Success.</P>

And you need not <Q><HI>conjure me to retain the same Freedom.</HI></Q> I am no Courtier; nor am I at all acquainted with the fashionable Methods of the <HI>Beau Monde.</HI> I shall therefore apply my self, according to my Capacity, in my accustomed Methods of Address, to answer your Desires.</P>
<P>You <Q><HI>Observe, that I insinuate as if Men may believe the Truth of the Gospel, without a saving Faith in Christ, without an Interest in him, or a Claim to the Benefits of his Redemption.

<P><PB N="109" REF="005572_0116_0000000000000000">I do indeed insist upon it, that Men may noti|onally and doctrinally believe the Truth of the Gospel, without a saving Faith in Christ, and with|out an Interest in him, or a Claim to the Benefits of his Redemption.&mdash;This is a Truth clearly taught in the Scriptures; and abundantly evident from the Reason and Nature of Things.&mdash;If any there|fore should expect Salvation, from a mere doctri|nal and historical Faith in Christ, they will in the Conclusion find themselves disappointed, and a|shamed of their Hope.</P>
<P>We read (Joh. xii. 42, 43.) of <HI>many of the chief Rulers who believed in Christ,</HI> but dared <HI>not confess him; for they loved the Praise of Men, more than the Praise of God.</HI>&mdash;And will any Man imagine, that such Believers who dare not <HI>confess Christ before Men,</HI> shall be confessed by him before his Heavenly Father and his holy Angels, in the great Day of Retribution?&mdash;Will any Man imagine, that our blessed Lord will own such for his sincere Disci|ples and Followers, who <HI>love the Praise of Men, more than the Praise of God?</HI>&mdash;Here then is a clear Instance of a doctrinal and historical Faith, which was not saving; and could give no Claim to the Promise made to true Believers.&mdash;We have this Matter further illustrated and confirm'd by the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> in the second Chapter of his Epis|tle; where we are shewn, that such a <HI>Faith is dead, being alone;</HI> that it is but a Carcase without Breath. <HI>As the Body without the Spirit is dead, so Faith without Works, is dead also.</HI> Of such a Faith we may therefore say with the same Apostle, <HI>What doth it profit, though a Man say that he has Faith? Can Faith save him?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="005572_0117_0000000000000000">But I need not multiply Scripture Quotations in this Case. It is what is continually confirm'd to us by our own Observation.&mdash;How many do we see every Day, who acknowledge the Truth of the Gospel, and yet live worldly, sensual and vicious Lives; <HI>who profess they know Christ, but in Works deny him;</HI> who call themselves by his Name, and yet value their Lusts and Idols above all the Hopes of his Sal|vation; and even run the Venture of eternal Per|dition, rather than <HI>deny themselves, take up their Cross, and follow him?</HI>&mdash;Now there can be nothing more certain, than that these Men are utterly unquali|fied for the Kingdom of God; and that they can have no special Interest in Him <HI>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI></P>

<P N="1"><PB N="111" REF="005572_0118_0000000000000000">1. A <HI>true</HI> and saving <HI>Faith,</HI> is a <HI>realizing</HI> and <HI>sen|sible Impression</HI> of the Truth of the Gospel: where|as a <HI>dead</HI> Faith is but a mere <HI>notional</HI> and <HI>specula|tive</HI> Belief of it.&mdash;<HI>Faith</HI> is by the Apostle describ|ed, <HI>the Substance of Things hoped for, and the Evi|dence of Things not seen:</HI> That which brings eter|nal Things into a near View; and represents them unto the Soul as undoubted Realities. Whence it is, that the true Believer, when he has experien|ced the Defect of his own Purposes and Endea|vours, when he is wearied out of all his false Refuges, emptied of all Hope in himself, and is brought to see and feel the Danger and Misery of his State by Nature, he is then brought in earnest to <HI>look to Jesus,</HI> as the only Refuge and Safety of his Soul.&mdash;He then sees the incomparable Excel|lency of a precious Saviour, breathes with ardent Desire after him, repairs to him as the only Foun|dation of his Hope; and proportionably to the E|vidence of his Interest in him, <HI>rejoices in Christ Jesus, having no Confidence in the Flesh.</HI>&mdash;Now, the blessed Sa|viour and his glorious Salvation is the Subject of his serious, frequent and delightful Contemplation.&mdash;Now, an Interest in Christ is valued by him above all the World; and he is in earnest to obtain and maintain good Evidence, that his Hope in Christ is well founded.&mdash;Now, the Favour of God, and the Concerns of the unseen and eternal World, appear of greater Importance than every Thing else.&mdash;He now mourns under a Sense of his former Sins; he groans under the Burden of his remain|ing Corruptions and Imperfections; and with ear|nest Diligence follows after Holiness, endea|vouring to work out his own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.&mdash;And in a Word, he has such an
<PB N="112" REF="005572_0119_0000000000000000">
Impression of these invisible Realities, that what|ever Temptations, Desertions, or prevailing Cor|ruptions he may conflict with, nothing can so ban|ish the great Concern from his Breast, as to make him habitually slothful and indifferent about it: Nothing can quiet him, short of having his Heart and Affections engaged in the Things of God and Godliness; and his Appetites and Passions under the Restraint and governing Influence of <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life.</HI></P>
<P>But now, on the other Hand, if we take a View of the Influence which a <HI>dead Faith</HI> has upon the Soul, it is visible, that this usually leaves the Subjects of it secure and careless, trifling and in|different, in the Concerns of the eternal World. These appear to such a Person but distant Futu|rities, which don't engage his solemn Attention, and make him in earnest solicitous about the Event; nor give any effectual Check to his inordinate Appetites &amp; Passions.&mdash;Or if (as it sometimes hap|pens) any awakning Dispensation alarms the Con|science of such a Person, to a distressing Appre|hension of his Guilt and Danger, drives him to Duties and external Reformations, and makes him more careful and watchful in his Conduct, he has yet no sensible impressive View of the <HI>Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;He either endeavours to pacify the Justice of God, and his own Conscience, by his Duties and religious Performances; and so lulls himself asleep again in his former Security: or else continues to agonize under most dark, dread|ful and unworthy Apprehensions of the glorious God, as if he were implacable and irreconcileable to such Sinners as he, &mdash;Such a Person would rea|dily acknowledge, but he cannot feel this blessed

Truth, that Christ Jesus is a sufficient Saviour.&mdash;He allows it to be Truth; but it is to him such a Truth, as has no effectual Influence upon his Heart and Life. Though he owns this to be true: Yet he can never comfortably venture his Soul and his eternal Interests upon it, unless a Ray of divine Light shine into his Soul, and give him a lively and sensible View of what he could before have but a slight and superficial Apprehension of.</P>
<P>Here then you see an apparent <HI>Difference</HI> be|tween a true and a false Faith. The one realizes the great Truths of the Gospel, by a lively and feeling Discovery of them; giving the <HI>Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> The other gives but a lifeless and un|active Assent to these important Truths.&mdash;The one influences the Heart and Affections, and by <HI>behold|ing with open Face, as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, changes the Soul into the same Image, from Glory to Glory:</HI> The other only swims in the Head, and leaves the Heart in a State either of Security or Despondency.&mdash;The one is an abiding Principle of divine Life, from which there flow Rivers of living Water: The other is transient and unsteady, and leaves the Soul short of any spiritual Principle of Life and Activity.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>saving Faith</HI> is an hearty <HI>Consent to the Terms</HI> of the Gospel: while a <HI>dead</HI> Faith is but a cold <HI>Assent to the Truth</HI> of it.&mdash;Accordingly a true Faith is in the Gospel described to be a <HI>receiving of the Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;To as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Children of God.</HI>&mdash;Our blessed Redeemer is freely offering himself and his saving Benefits to poor perishing Sinners, in
<PB N="114" REF="005572_0121_0000000000000000">
the Gospel. Our Compliance with and Acceptance of the Gospel Offer, are the Terms of our Interest in him, and constitute the <HI>Faith of God's Elect.</HI>&mdash;They therefore, and they only, are true Believers in Christ, who heartily acquiesce in the glorious Me|thod of a Sinner's Recovery from Ruin by Jesus Christ; and heartily accept an offered Saviour, in all his Offices and Benefits.&mdash;A true Believer, con|vinc'd of his natural Blindness and Ignorance, re|pairs to the Lord Jesus Christ, to enlighten his Mind, to make his Way plain before him, and to give him a clear sensible and spiritual Acquaintance with the great Things of his eternal Peace.&mdash;The true Believer has found by Experience his utter In|capacity to procure the divine Favour by the best of his Duties, Reformations, or moral Performances, and that he has Cause to be ashamed and confoun|ded in his own Sight, for the great Defects of his highest Attainments in Religion: and therefore welcomes the Lord Jesus Christ to his Soul, as the <HI>Lord his Righteousness,</HI> repairs to him, and to him only, <HI>for Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption;</HI> and builds all his Hope of Acceptance with God, upon what Christ has done and suffer|ed for him.&mdash;The trueBeliever labours and is heavy|laden with the Sinfulness of his Nature; and longs for a further Victory over his corrupt Affections, Appetites and Passions, for more Spirituality in his Duties, and for a further Progress in Piety and Ho|liness; and therefore heartily desires and accepts the Lord Jesus Christ, as his <HI>Sanctifier,</HI> as well as <HI>Saviour;</HI> and earnestly seeks after the renewing, strengthening, and quickening Influences of his blessed Spirit.&mdash;The true Believer feels the Necessity of this
<PB N="115" REF="005572_0122_0000000000000000">
blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> in all his Offices, Relations, and Characters. He sees him to be just such a <HI>Saviour</HI> as his Soul wants; and therefore chearfully accepts a whole Christ, with his whole Heart, without any Reserve, without any Desire of other Terms of Acceptance with God.&mdash;He may entertain dark Apprehensions of himself, and complain heavily of the great Defects of his Faith and Holiness: but he can never entertain hard Thoughts of the Gos|pel-Scheme; nor complain of the Terms of Salva|tion therein proposed. These appear to him <HI>the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God;</HI> and every Way answer the Exigen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his State, and the Desires of his Soul.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, we consider the Character of a <HI>dead Faith,</HI> it is what never brings the Soul to a full Consent to the Terms of the Gospel, without some Exception and Reserve.&mdash;The unfound Belie|ver may imagine, that he accepts of the Lord Jesus Christ as his <HI>Saviour:</HI> But what is the Foundation and encouraging Motive of his imaginary Compli|ance with the Gospel-Offer? Upon an impartial In|quiry, it will always be found to be something <HI>in himself:</HI> His good Affections, Duties, Moralities, Reformations, Promises, or Purposes. He endea|vours by these to recommend himself to God; and on the Account of these, he hopes to find Accep|tance thro' Christ.&mdash;Or if he feels ever so strong a Desire of Salvation by Christ, yet he is driven to it only by <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Self-Love;</HI> and will renew his Affection to his <HI>other Lords,</HI> as soon as his awakning Apprehensions are worn off.&mdash;He don't feel his Want of Christ's enlightning and enlivening Influ|ences: For he knows not what they mean.&mdash;He
<PB N="116" REF="005572_0123_0000000000000000">
<HI>submits not to the Righteousness of Christ.</HI> For he is still endeavouring to procure Acceptance with God from some good Qualifications of his own, some Duties which he performs, or some Progress which he makes or designs to make in his religious Course.&mdash;He cannot submit to Christ as his <HI>Lord.</HI> For there is some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lothful Indulgence, which he cannot forego, some darling Lust which he cannot part with, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which his Heart is set upon, or some difficult Duty which he must excuse himself from.</P>
<P>There is nothing more apparent, than the <HI>Distinc|tion</HI> between these two Sorts of Believers. The one comes to Christ destitute of all Hope and Help in himself; but sees enough in Christ to answer all his Wants. The other is full in himself.&mdash;The one looks to Christ to be his Light. The other leans to his own Understanding&mdash;The one makes Mention of Christ's Righteousness, and that only. The other hopes for an Interest in Christ and his Salva|tion, on Account of his own Attainments; and in Effect, expects Justification by his own Righteous|ness, for Christ's Sake.&mdash;The one brings a guilty, polluted, unworthy Soul to the blessed Redeemer, without any Qualification to recommend it: expect|ing from him alone all the Supplies he wants, re|pairing to him for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire, that he may be rich; for Eye-Salve, that he may see; and for white Raiment, that he may be cloathed.</HI> The other ordi|narily raises his Expectations from Christ, in Pro|portion to his own imaginary Qualifications and good Disposition.&mdash;The one as well desires Salvation by Christ from Pollution, as from Guilt. The other has a Reserve of some deceitful Lust; and huggs some <HI>Delilah</HI> in his Bosom, which he can't be willing to
<PB N="117" REF="005572_0124_0000000000000000">
part with.&mdash;In fine, the one is willing to accept of the Lord Jesus Christ upon any Terms. The other will not come to Christ, but upon Terms of his own Stating.&mdash;But I shall find Occasion to speak further to some of these Things under the following Head.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>saving</HI> Faith is a humble <HI>Trust</HI> in, and <HI>De|pendance</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as the Author of our eternal Salvation: But a <HI>dead</HI> Faith always builds upon some <HI>false</HI> Foundation, or upon none at all.&mdash;A <HI>saving</HI> Faith is often described in Scripture by <HI>a trusting in the Lord, committing our Way to him, resting in him,</HI> and other such like Expressions; which suppose a humble Confidence in the abundant Sufficiency of the Redeemer's Merits, and the bound|less Riches of God's Mercy in him.&mdash;Accordingly the true Believer, in his greatest Darkness and Dis|couragement, ventures his Soul and eternal Interests in the Hands of Christ with at least a supporting and encouraging <HI>Hope.</HI>&mdash;His past Sins may appear in a most affrightning Forms vastly numerous, dreadfully aggravated: However, he yet keeps his Hope alive with this comforting Consideration, that <HI>the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all Sin.</HI>&mdash;He may be op|pressed with a Sense of the horrible Defects of his Duties and religious Attainments: but he yet sees <HI>Righteousness</HI> enough in Christ, for a safe Foundation of Confidence, though he find none in himself.&mdash;This, and this alone, keeps his Soul from sinking, answers the Clamours of Conscience, and disposes him to rely upon the free Grace and Mercy of God.&mdash;He may be distressed with the Prevalence of his inward Corruptions; He may in an unguarded Hour, be surprized and soil'd by the Power of his sinful Appetites or Passions, or by some unexpected
<PB N="118" REF="005572_0125_0000000000000000">
Temptation: but even in this Case, his Refuge is in that blessed <HI>Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</HI>&mdash;And though from sad Experience of his own dreadful Imperfections, he may be ready to question his State, and to fear lest he be deceived, and lest he should finally be ashamed of his Hope, nevertheless he ventures that also in the Hands of Christ, and depends upon him, that he won't leave him to a Soul-ruining Deceit, but will <HI>guide him by his Counsel,</HI> and <HI>afterward bring him to Glory.</HI> &mdash;Such a Dependance upon Christ the Believer ordinarily exercises in his darkest Hours and dullest Frames.&mdash;But when in the more lively Exercise of Grace, and when Christ is pleased to shine into the Soul with clearer Communications of his Love, his Confidence (like a Rock in the Sea) stands unmoved in the greatest Tempests; and he <HI>knows whom he has be|lieved, that he is able to keep that which he has com|mitted to him, against that Day.</HI> With this Confi|dence he can even <HI>glory in Tribulation;</HI> he can chearfully look Death it self in the Face, and triumph over the King of Terrors.</P>
<P>But now, if we take a View of a <HI>dead</HI> Faith, we shall find in it the quite contrary Properties.&mdash;The unsincere Professor (as has been observ'd already) or|dinarily raises his Expectations and Encouragements from something <HI>in himself.</HI> His good Frames, his Joys and Comforts, his Endeavours or Designs to serve God, are what he has to depend upon: And upon these he does and will depend; and perhaps will never see his Mistake, 'till it be too late.&mdash;Some of these indeed don't find even this false Foundation to build upon: but quiet their Souls with a loose and general Hope.&mdash;They believe, that God is merciful, and that
<PB N="119" REF="005572_0126_0000000000000000">
Jesus Christ came to save Sinners; or they hope, they shall some Time or another obtain Grace, tho' they find none at present. Thus too many of them go on quietly in their Sins, dwell <HI>at Ease,</HI> and cry <HI>Peace</HI> to their Souls, 'till the Flood of God's Dis|pleasure sweeps away their Refuges of Lies.&mdash;Others there be, who by Means of a better Education, or from some awakning Sense of their Guilt and Dan|ger, cannot but see, that these Beds are too short to stretch themselves upon; and therefore their Faith is their Torment. They believe in Christ as their Judge; but not as their Saviour. They spend their Lives in Fears and Anxieties, in Disquietude and Un|easiness of Mind, as often as their Consciences are awake, to entertain any serious Apprehensions of a future and eternal World.&mdash;Thus they live under a <HI>Spirit of Bondage;</HI> not being able to venture their guilty Souls upon the pardoning Mercy of God, and the infinite Merit of the Redeemer's Blood.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more apparent, than the Distinc|tion and Difference here represented, between these two Sorts of <HI>Believers.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>one,</HI> in all his Straits, Fears, Difficulties and Dangers, looks unto Christ as to a sure Foundation of Safety, Confidence and Hope: And though he may at some Times doubt his In|terest in Christ, he can at no Time deliberately place his Confidence or expect Safety for his Soul any where else, but in the mere Mercy of God in Christ. The <HI>other</HI> leaves the Soul asleep; or else seeks Rest only from the Righteousness of the Law, from De|sires and Endeavours of his own, and must either find Comfort there, or no where.&mdash;The <HI>one</HI> ventures all his Interests, and all his Hopes of Grace and Glory, upon the Faithfulness of the Gospel-Promises, and
<PB N="120" REF="005572_0127_0000000000000000">
the infinite Mercy of God in Christ. The <HI>other</HI> sees no Way to quiet the Accusations of his Conscience, and to obtain Qualifications for Salvation, by depend|ing upon a naked Promise.&mdash;In a Word, the <HI>one</HI> can see Safety and Security, in leaving all the Con|cerns both of Time and Eternity in the Hands of Christ. The <HI>other</HI> being ignorant of the Righteous|ness of God, must make the Righteousness of the Law his Refuge, or else live without the Comfort of Hope.</P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>saving</HI> Faith subjects the Soul to the <HI>Scepter</HI> and <HI>Yoke</HI> of Christ: but a <HI>dead</HI> Faith leaves the Soul <HI>unrenewed</HI> and <HI>disobedient.</HI>&mdash;A true <HI>Faith purifies the Heart,</HI> and <HI>overcomes the World;</HI> and <HI>he that hath this Hope in Christ, purifieth himself even as He is pure.</HI> A true Faith unites the Soul to Christ, as the Branch is united to the Vine; and thereby enables the Man to bring forth much Fruit.&mdash;The true Believer hates every false Way; he mourns over, and watches, strives, and prays against all the Corruptions of his Nature, and all the Imperfections of his Heart and Life.&mdash;There is no known Sin, which he indulges himself in; no known Duty, which he willingly neglects; no Difficulty, which can deter him from following Christ; no Temptation, which can allure him from endeavouring a Conformity to the whole Will of God.&mdash;<HI>Not as tho' he had already attained; or were already perfect.</HI> He has dailyCause to lament his Defects: but yet, he can truly say, that <HI>he delights in the Law of the Lord, after the inward Man;</HI> and ac|cordingly endeavours in every Station and Relation, in all his Conduct both to God and Man, as well in secret as openly, to live a Life of Conformity to God, in all the Duties he requires of him.&mdash;And wherein
<PB N="121" REF="005572_0128_0000000000000000">
he cannot attain, he is yet <HI>pressing towards Perfection,</HI> and groaning after a further Progress in Holiness, even in all Instances, without Reserve; nor yet satisfy'd without a final Perseverance, to crown his Sincerity.</P>
<P>But on the otherHand, the Obedience of an <HI>unsincere</HI> Professor is very partial, defective, temporary; and but a Matter of Force and Constraint upon the Ap|petites and Affections. If with <HI>Herod</HI> he reforms and <HI>does many Things,</HI> he yet retains his <HI>Herodias,</HI> some darling Corruption unmortified; or leaves some un|pleasant Duty neglected. Or if by the Lashes of an awaken'd Conscience, he is driven for a Time to a more general Reformation from all known Sin, and to outward Attendance upon all known Duty, he finds no inward Complacency in it; and therefore is like a dull Horse, that will be kept on his Way no longer than he feels a Spur in his Side.</P>
<P>Here then is a conspicuous Difference between a true and a false Believer. The <HI>one</HI> has a Principle of Holiness, a Delight in it, and an earnest and continuing Desire after further Proficiency in the di|vine Life. The <HI>other</HI> aims only at so much Holi|ness as he thinks will save him from Hell, but cares for nothing more; and what he has, is excited by Fear, or constrain'd by Force, contrary to the natu|ral Tendency and Biass of his Soul.&mdash;In Fine, the <HI>one</HI> makes it the Endeavour of his Life, to approve himself to a pure, holy and omniscient God. The <HI>other</HI> rests in Endeavours to quiet his Conscience, and to silence its Clamours and Accusations.</P>
<P N="5">5. A <HI>saving</HI> Faith works by <HI>Love</HI> to God and Man: but a <HI>dead</HI> Faith always falls short of both.&mdash;The Apostle assures us, that <HI>if we have all Faith, so that we could remove Mountains, and have not Charity,
<PB N="122" REF="005572_0129_0000000000000000">
we are Nothing.&mdash;Faith worketh by Love;</HI> and the true Believer <HI>keeps himself in the Love of God, look|ing to the Mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ for eternal Life.</HI>&mdash;He delights in contemplating the glorious Perfections of the divine Nature. His Meditations upon God are sweet, and the Thoughts of Him precious to his Soul.&mdash;He values the Favour of God as Life, and his Loving-kindness as better than Life. If he can have the glorious God for his Portion, and live in the Light of his Countenance, he can be content with Straits and Difficulties, Trials and Af|flictions, here in the World.&mdash;He takes peculiar Pleasure in the Ordinances of God, and all the ap|pointed Means of a near Approach into his special Presence; and is especially pleased, when favour'd with sensible Communion with God.&mdash;Though he can't always walk so near to God, and find such sensible Delight in him; yet he laments his Absence, when he withdraws; heavily complains of his own Dead|ness, Worldliness, or Sensuality, which separates be|tween God and his Soul; and can find no true Rest or Satisfaction, till he return to God, and God to him.&mdash;This is at least the ordinary Course and Te|nour of the Believer's Life: and if at any Time he should be so left of God as to grow forgetful of him, and have any continuing 66Prevalence of a dead carnal worldly Frame in his Soul, this darkens the Evidence of his State, robs him of his Comfort and Peace, and will at Length put him upon vigorous and active Endeavours for obtaining a Revival of his languishing Graces, by a fresh Supply of the Spi|rit of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Thus, the true Believer hath the Love of <HI>God</HI> dwelling in him; and from the same Principle, he
<PB N="123" REF="005572_0130_0000000000000000">
likewise loves his <HI>Neighbour</HI> as himself.&mdash;He main|tains a Life of Justice, Meekness, Kindness and Benefi|cence towards all Men, bears Injuries, is ready to forgive, entertains the best Opinion of Men's State &amp; Actions, that the Case will allow; and endeavours to live in the Exercise of <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentle|ness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Meekness.</HI> And as he thus maintains a Love of <HI>Benevolence</HI> to all Men, he has in a special Manner a Love of <HI>Complacence</HI> to|wards those who bear the Marks of the divine Image.&mdash;These he delights in, on Account of their being (or at least appearing to be) the Children of God. He loves them for their heavenly Father's Sake, as well as for those gracious Qualifications, which make <HI>the Righteous more excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> He loves the Company of the Saints. These are <HI>the ex|cellent, in whom is all his Delight.</HI> He loves their Piety; and studies an Imitation of them, wherein they follow Christ; and studies to equal (if not excel) them in their highest Improvements in Religion. He loves their Persons; and hopes to join in Consort with them in the eternal Praises of God.</P>
<P>This is the real and genuine Character of every true Believer: while the highest Attainments of a <HI>dead Faith</HI> do fall short of every Part of this Description.&mdash;The false Professor may imagine, that he has some|thing of the <HI>Love of</HI> GOD in him: but upon a just View of the Case it will appear, that 'tis only to an <HI>Idol,</HI> the Creature of his own Imagination. If he seems to love God under an Apprehension of his Goodness and Mercy, he yet dreads him on Account of his Justice, and has an inward Aversation to his Purity and Holiness; so that the Object of his Love is an imaginary Being, of infinite Goodness and
<PB N="124" REF="005572_0131_0000000000000000">
Mercy, without either Justice or Holiness.&mdash;If from the Alarms of Conscience, or some Emotions of his natural Affections, he may take some Pleasure in re|ligious Exercises, this Pleasure is short and transient, like the Principle from whence it flows; he soon returns to Carelesness and Forgetfulness of God, and has his Affections quickly engaged in worldly and sensual Pursuits.&mdash;And however he may deceive himself, in any supposed Progress in Religion, he can never satisfy his Soul with having God for his Porti|on. He can never in Course keep up a Life of Spi|ritual Mindedness, and Delight in God, and in a Way of Obedience to him, and Communion with him.</P>
<P>The same Defects are likewise found in the un|found Believer with Respect to his Love to his <HI>Neighbour.</HI>&mdash;If he be not (as it's too commonly found) unjust and deceitful, wrathful and contentious, hard-hearted and unkind, bitter and censorious, re|vengeful and implacable: Yet he never loves the Children of God as such.&mdash;Whatever Love he may have to any such from special intimate Acquaintance, or from their being in the same Cause, Party or Per|swasion with himself (which is indeed no more than the Exercise of Self-Love or Self-Esteem) he never loves the Image of Christ in every Sect or Party, in whom he finds it, nor can he love a Conformity to the Children of God in the Holiness of their Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>Here then you see an apparent Difference in these two Sorts of <HI>Believers.</HI>&mdash;The one loves God above all Things: and indeed he that does not love him with a supreme Love, does not love him as God; and consequently don't love him at all. But the other seeks the Favour of God, from no other
<PB N="125" REF="005572_0132_0000000000000000">
Motive but Fear of his Displeasure, or some Desire of Happiness; and not from a Sense of the Excellency of his glorious Perfections, and the Blessedness of an Interest in his Favour.&mdash;The one loves what God loves; hates what he hates; and loves and esteems himself but in Proportion to his Conformity unto God. The other retains his Delight in his Lusts and Idols; and repairs to God because he durst not do other|wise.&mdash;The one, like God himself, takes Pleasure in doing Good to all Men; and takes special Delight in all without Distinction, who are Partakers of the divine Nature.&mdash;The other at the best has his Love to Man influenced by selfish Principles; and there|fore takes most Delight in those, who are most con|formable to his own Sentiments or Dispositions.</P>
<P>Lest I should weary out your Patience, I shall just mention but this one Particular more&mdash;</P>
<P N="6">6. A <HI>saving</HI> Faith <HI>humbles</HI> the Soul, and makes it low and vile in its own Eyes: Whereas a <HI>dead</HI> Faith tends to <HI>exalt</HI> the Mind with vain Apprehen|sions of, or Endeavours after, some Sufficiency or Excellency of its own.&mdash;The <HI>true Believer</HI> has a deep Sense of the Greatness and Aggravations of his Sins, <HI>loathes</HI> himself on Account of them; and adores the Patience and Long-suffering of God toward him, that has kept him out of Hell. He is so sensible of the great Defects of his Duties, of the Sinfulness of his Heart, the Imperfections of his Life, and his utter Unworthiness of any Favour from God, that he cannot but entertain a most deep and sensi|ble Impression, that it must be a wonderful Display of mere sovereign Grace, if ever he obtains Salvation.&mdash;It is always true, that the greater Manifestation of God's Love is made to his Soul, the greater Sense
<PB N="126" REF="005572_0133_0000000000000000">
he hath of his own Nothingness and Unworthiness, and the more he admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es and adores the astonishing Riches of free distinguishing <HI>Grace</HI> to such a guilty polluted Creature as he is.&mdash;Though the true Belie|ver lives in the Exercise of that <HI>Charity</HI> towards o|thers, which <HI>thinketh no Evil, but believeth all Things and hopeth all Things;</HI> he yet always finds Occasion to condemn himself, and to censure his own inward Affections, and outward Performances, religious Du|ties and moral Conduct; and therefore cannot but esteem <HI>others better than himself.</HI>&mdash;In short, the true Believer always, <HI>while in this Tabernacle, groans being burthened.</HI> He finds Occasions of a renewed Repentance every Day: He every Day finds new Cause to complain of himself; and new Cause to commit a sinful and unworthy Soul to the mere Mercy of God in Christ.</P>
<P>On the contrary, a <HI>dead Faith</HI> always either <HI>puffs up the vain Mind</HI> with a haughty pleasing Appre|hension of its own Attainments, makes it censorious and uncharitable, and inspires it with that proud pharisaical Language, <HI>I thank God, I am not as other Men:</HI> or else from the same haughty Principle, either leaves the Soul <HI>secure</HI> and <HI>easy,</HI> in its good Designs and Purposes of future Repentance; or <HI>impatient</HI> and <HI>desponding,</HI> through Want of those good Qualifications which it supposes necessary.</P>
<P>I think, I need not enlarge upon this Distinction; it is so apparent and manifest, and the Characters so easy to be known.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, to sum up the whole in a short and easy View.&mdash;If you have good Evidence of a <HI>saving Faith</HI> in Christ, you must have such a sensible Im|pression of the Truth of the Gospel, as makes you
<PB N="127" REF="005572_0134_0000000000000000">
feel the Importance of your eternal Concerns, and your Necessity of an Interest in Christ; and puts your Soul upon earnest and active Desires after him, as your only Hope and Safety.&mdash;You must heartily approve the Way of Salvation which the Gospel reveals; and heartily consent to the Terms on which it is offered.&mdash;You must ac|cept of Christ as a free Gift; bringing Nothing with you of your own, to recommend you to his Acceptance.&mdash;You must accept of him as your only Righteousness to justify you before God; and as your Prince, as well as Saviour; consenting as well to be governed as to be saved, to be sanctified as to be justified by him.&mdash;And as you must receive him, so you must confidently trust in him alone, as a sure Foundation of Safety and Hope; and as a continu|ing Fountain of all Supplies of Grace to your Soul, whatever Difficulties and Discouragements you may meet with.&mdash;And you must have this standing Evi|dence of the Sincerity of your Faith, that it purifies your Heart; and brings you to an earnest Desire of and Endeavour after habitual Holiness of Heart and Life; that it works by Love to God and Man; and keeps up in your Soul an abasing Sense of your own Vileness and utter Unworthiness, after all.&mdash;This is that precious Faith, to which the Promises of the Gospel are made, and to which no false Professor can make any just Pretence.</P>
<P>To conclude with a still shorter View of this Case.&mdash;When a realizing Belief of the Gospel; and a Despair of all Help in your self brings you to repair to Christ as your only Safety; and to venture your Soul, guilty as it is, upon the Merit of his Obedience, the Sufficiency of his Grace and Strength, and the
<PB N="128" REF="005572_0135_0000000000000000">
Faithfulness of his Promise; and heartily to submit to his Rule and Government, now you can't fail of the sanctifying Influences of his Spirit, to qualify you for the eternal Inheritance: For <HI>the Amen, the true and faithful Witness,</HI> has given you his Word for it, that if you thus <HI>come to him, he will in no Wise cast you out.</HI></P>
<P>I might sum up this important Point in a yet shorter View.&mdash;If you so heartily approve of, and delight in the Gospel-Way of Salvation by Christ alone, that you can cheerfully venture your Soul and your eternal Interests upon it, as the sure and only Foundation of Hope and Safety, you have then the Faith of God's Elect. And in this Case he that has be|stowed such Grace upon you, will carry on his own Work in your Soul, will give you those several Qualifi|cations and Evidences of a gracious State, which I have above described; and will at last present you fault|less before his Throne, with exceeding Joy.&mdash;That you may have the delightful Experience of such a Progress of Grace in your Soul, is the Prayer of</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Wherein the Dif|ference between a legal and an evan|gelical Repentance is distinctly con|sidered.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU justly observe, <Q><HI>It is of infinite Concern, that your</HI> Repentance <HI>towards God (as well
<PB N="129" REF="005572_0136_0000000000000000">
as your Faith towards the Lord Jesus Christ) be sincere; and that you have therefore Cause to be solicitous, not to be deceived with a Repentance which must be repented of.</HI></Q> And you have therefore just Reason to desire <Q><HI>a clear Apprehension of the</HI> Difference, <HI>between a</HI> legal <HI>and an</HI> evangelical <HI>Repentance.</HI></Q> I shall therefore endeavour accor|ding to your Desire, <Q><HI>to shew you the Difference, in as easy and familiar a Light as I can.</HI></Q>&mdash;And perhaps it may give you a clearer View of the Case, if I should shew you first negatively, where|in the Destinction does <HI>not</HI> consist, under a few Particulars, before I proceed to a direct Illustration of it.</P>
<P>It may then be observed, that a deep <HI>Distress</HI> of Mind on Account of <HI>sinning against God,</HI> is common both to a legal and evangelical Repentance.&mdash;Even <HI>Judas</HI> could cry out with Agony of Soul, <HI>I have sinned in betraying innocent Blood;</HI> as well as the Psal|mist groans out his Complaint, that there was <HI>no Rest in his Bones because of his Sins.</HI>&mdash;A distressing Sense of Sin, in it self consider'd, is therefore no Evidence for, nor against, the Truth and Sincerity of Repentance.</P>
<P>Moreover a <HI>fearful</HI> Apprehension of the divine <HI>Displeasure,</HI> may be common to both Sorts of Pe|nitents.&mdash;Mere legal Convictions may make <HI>Sin|ners in Zion afraid, and Fearfulness surprize the Hy|pocrite;</HI> And <HI>Destruction from God may be a Terror</HI> to a holy <HI>Job,</HI> in as great Reality, though not with such despairing Infidelity, as to a <HI>Cain</HI> or <HI>Judas;</HI> that this can be no distinguishing Mark of a true or false Repentance.</P>
<P>I may add, <HI>Dread</HI> of, and a temporary <HI>Reforma|tion</HI> from outward and known Courses of <HI>sinning,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="005572_0137_0000000000000000">
may likewise be the Consequence of both a legal and evangelical Repentance.&mdash;<HI>Ahab</HI> humbled him|self, lay in Sackcloth, and went softly; and <HI>Herod</HI> reform'd many Things, as well as <HI>David refrain'd his Feet from every evil Way.</HI>&mdash;It's impossible for a Sinner to give the Reins to his Lusts, while under the severe Lashes of an awaken'd Conscience: that a mere legal Conviction must, while it lasts, procure an external Reformation.&mdash;Such a Refor|mation, of it self, can therefore be no Evidence of a sincere Repentance, how great soever it may ap|pear; and before it can be no Evidence against it.</P>
<P>Besides, Men may be put upon <HI>Diligence</HI> and <HI>Activity in Duty,</HI> by both a legal and evangelical Repentance.&mdash;An unsincere Repentance may bring Men with the hypocritical Jews, to <HI>seek the Lord daily; and delight to know his Ways, as a Nation that did Righteousness. In their Afflictions they may seek him early.</HI> They <HI>may seek him and return; and en|quire early after God.</HI>&mdash;This may be the Fruit of a legal Repentance; as well as that a true Repentance may and always does, bring Men to <HI>lift up their Hearts and their Hands to God in the Heavens.</HI> &mdash;This therefore can be no distinguishing Criterion, in the Case before us.</P>
<P>Once more, a <HI>comforting Perswasion</HI> of having ob|tain'd <HI>pardoning Mercy,</HI> is common to both Kinds of Penitents.&mdash;God's ancient People when most incor|rigible in their Impiety, would <HI>trust in lying Words, come and stand before him in the House that was called by his Name; and say, We are delivered to do all these Abominations.</HI> The Israelites in the Wilderness concluded, that <HI>God was their Rock, and the most high God their Redeemer, when they flattered him with their Lips and lyed to him with their Tongues; and
<PB N="131" REF="005572_0138_0000000000000000">
their Hearts were not right with him.</HI>&mdash;And on the other Hand, the true Penitent may say with <HI>David, I said I will confess my Transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest me the Iniquity of my Sin.</HI> &mdash;A meer Perswasion of Forgiveness therefore, how comfor|table or joyful soever, don't distinguish the Nature of that Repentance, on which such a Perswasion is founded.</P>
<P>In short, it is not the deepest Sense of Sin or Guilt; nor the most distressing Sorrow on that Account; it is not the Fear of God's Wrath, nor the greatest external Reformation of Life; it is not the most diligent external Attendance upon all known Duty; nor the most quieting Perswasion of having made our Peace with God; nor all these together, that will denominate a Man sincerely pe|nitent.&mdash;For all these may be, and have been, at|tain'd by mere Hypocrites; and often are found with the false, as well as the true Professor.</P>
<P>Having, by Way of Precaution, given you these Remarks, I now proceed directly to consider the important Case before us. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance flows only from a Sense of <HI>Danger,</HI> and Fear of <HI>Wrath:</HI> But an evangelical Repentance is a true Mourning for <HI>Sin;</HI> and an earnest Desire of <HI>Deliverance</HI> from it.&mdash;When the Conscience of a Sinner is alarm'd with a Sense of his dreadful Guilt and Danger, it must necessarily remonstrate against those Impieties, which threaten him with Destruction and Ruin. Thence those Frights and Terrors, which we so commonly see in awaken'd Sinners.&mdash;Their Sins (especially some grosser Enormities of their Lives) stare them in the Face, with their peculiar Aggravations. Con|science draws up the Indictment; and sets home
<PB N="132" REF="005572_0139_0000000000000000">
Charge against them. The Law passes the Sen|tence; and condemns them without Mercy.&mdash;And what have they now in Prospect? But a fearful looking for of fiery Indignation to consume them!&mdash;Now with what Distress will they cry out, of the Greatness and Aggravations of their Sins?&mdash;With what Amazement will they expect the dreadful Is|sue of a sinful Course?&mdash;How ready are they now to take up Resolutions of a more watchful and holy Life?&mdash;Now they are brought upon their Knees before God, to acknowledge their Sins and to cry for Mercy; and now Conference like a flaming Sword, keeps them from their former Course of Impiety and sensual Gratifications.&mdash;And what is all this Repentance, but mere Terror and Fear of Hell? Let but Conscience be pacified, and their Fear blown over; and the Dug will quick return to his Vomit again, 'till some new Alarm revive the Conviction of their Sin and Danger, and their former Process of Repentance. Thus some will sin and repent, and repent and sin, all their Lives; and yet lie open to eternal Repentance after all.&mdash;Or if the Distress of Conscience make so deep an Impression, and fix such an abiding Awe of particular Sins upon the Mind, that there remains a visible and continuing Reformation: Yet their Lusts are but dammed up by their Fears, &amp; were but the Dam broken down, they would run again in their former Channel with renewed Force.&mdash;It is true, the Law sometimes proves a School-master to drive Sinners to Christ; and Conviction of Sin and a legal Repentance is a necessary Preparative to a saving Conversion; but this alone gives no Claim to the Promise of the Gospel.&mdash;<HI>The House</HI> may be thus <HI>empty, swept and garnished,</HI> but for the
<PB N="133" REF="005572_0140_0000000000000000">
Reception of <HI>seven worse Spirits</HI> than were driven out of it; and a Sinner may thus <HI>escape the Pollu|tions of the World,</HI> and yet have <HI>his latter End worse than his Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>If on the other Hand, we consider the Character of a sincere <HI>Gospel-Repentance,</HI> though such legal Terrors may lead to its Exercise, they don't belong to its Nature; nor are they any Part of its De|scription. Sin, it self, becomes the greatest Burthen and Aversation to a truly penitent Soul.&mdash;<HI>I hate</HI> (says the Psalmist) <HI>every false Way.&mdash;O wretched Man that I am</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI>&mdash;Thus the Penitent groans being burden'd; not for Fear of Hell, such Fear being no Part of a true Repentance, though it may sometimes accompany a sincere and godly Sorrow for Sin. But this Sorrow arises from an affecting, humbling, mourning Sense of Sin, from a View of the Sin of Nature, with the Hardness of the Heart, and universal Depravity of the Af|fections which flow from it; and from a View of the numerous Sins of Practice, with their special Aggravations. This is the Grief, this the Distress of a repenting Sinner.&mdash;It is necessary from the Nature of a true Repentance, that it must have Respect both to the Sin of Nature and Practice: though both of these are not at all Times actually in the Mind; and particularly thought of, and mourned for by the repenting Sinner.&mdash;The Lan|guage of a true Repentance is such as that. <HI>I acknowledge my Transgressions; and my Sin is ever before me. Mine Iniquities are gone over mine Heal, as an heavy Burthen, they are too heavy for me. De|liver me from all my Transgressions. Let not my Sins have Dominion over me. Innumerable Evils have
<PB N="134" REF="005572_0141_0000000000000000">
compassed me about, mine Iniquities have taken Hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up: they are more than the Hairs of mine Head; therefore my Heart faileth me. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me O Lord make Haste to help me.</HI>&mdash;As the true Penitent longs for more and more Victory over his Corruptions, so is he most watchful, prayerful and in earnest to mortify his Lusts, and to cut off all Supplies of Sin. He mourns for all, he hates all his Lusts; and is willing to spare none, no not so much as a right Hand, or a right Eye.&mdash;As there is nothing so grievous to him as Sin, so there is Nothing which he so earnestly desires and pursues, as a nearer Approach to that blessed State, where <HI>No|thing can enter which defileth or worketh Abomination.</HI></P>
<P>Here you see an apparent Difference, between being struck with Fear, restrain'd by Terror, and driven from a Course of sinning by the Lashes of an awakned Conscience, between this (I say) and Loathing our selves in our own Sight, for all our Iniquities and Abominations, with a Groaning after Grace and Strength to conquer and mortify our Cor|ruptions, and be free from the Empire of Sin.&mdash;That is merely the Fruit of Self-Love, which prompts the Soul to fly from Danger. This is the Exercise of a vital Principle, which separates the Soul from Sin; and engages the whole Man in a continued Opposition against it.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance flows from <HI>Unbelief:</HI> But an <HI>Evangelical</HI> Repentance is always the Fruit and Consequence of a saving <HI>Faith.</HI> I have shewn you already, that a legal Repentance is effected by fearful Apprehensions of Hell and Damnation. And whence is this amazing and distracting Fear and Terror?&mdash;Has not the Gospel provided a
<PB N="135" REF="005572_0142_0000000000000000">
glorious Relief for such Distresses; and opened a blessed Door of Hope for the greatest Sinners? Is not Pardon and Salvation freely offered to all, that will accept a blessed Saviour and his saving Benefits? Is not the Blood of Christ sufficient to cleanse from all Sins, however circumstanced, and however aggravated they may be? Why then don't they chearfully fly for Refuge to this Hope set before them?&mdash;Alas, they can see no Safety in it! The Law of God challenges their Obedience; and condemns their Disobedience. Conscience joins in, both with the Precept and Sen|tence of the Law: and thence their only Refuge is Resolutions, Reformations, Duties, Penance or some such self-righteous Methods to pacify God's Justice, to quiet their Consciences; and to lay a Foundation of future Hope.&mdash;The Defect of their Endeavours and Attainments, creates new Terrors. Their Terrors excite new Endeavours. And thus they go on without <HI>attaining the Law of Righteous|ness; because they seek it not of Faith: but as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI>&mdash;They may, it's true, have some Respect to Christ, in this their le|gal Progress. They may hope, that God will ac|cept them for Christ's Sake. They may use his Name in their Prayers for Pardon, while they dare not depend upon the Merits of his Blood for the Remission of their Sins and a Freedom from Condemnation. And what is all this, but a secret Hope, that the Redemption of Christ will add such Merit to their Frights and Fears, Reformati|ons and Duties, as to make them effectual to atone for their Sins; and purchase the Favour of God?&mdash;So that all their penitential Shews and Appear|ances are Nothing but the Workings of Unbelief.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="005572_0143_0000000000000000">Let us now take a View of an <HI>evangelical</HI> Re|pentance; and we shall find the Characters of it directly repugnant to what has been considered. This must always be the Consequence of a saving Faith; and can never go before it.&mdash;The Sinner must have a realizing Apprehension of the Purity and Holiness of the divine Nature, before he can loathe and hate his Sins, on the Account of their Contrariety to God.&mdash;He must have a feeling Sense, that there is pardoning Mercy with God for Sin|ners, before he can with Courage and Sincerity apply for Forgiveness to a just and holy God.&mdash;He must have a believing Discovery of the Way in which God is accessible by Sinners, before he can <HI>have Access with Boldness to the Throne of Grace.</HI> He must see and feel, that there is Safety in ven|turing a guilty Soul in the Hands of Christ and no where else, before he can look to his Blood for cleansing from Guilt; and to his Grace and Strength for Victory over his Corruptions. He must be united to Christ <HI>as a Branch to the Vine,</HI> before he can bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance.&mdash;Without this he may be driven into desponding Fears and to legal Attempts for Safety: but he cannot <HI>fly for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before him.</HI>&mdash;The true Penitent therefore approaches God's Pre|sence with a deep Impression of his Guilt, and Un|worthiness; and of his just Desert of an eternal Rejection from God. But then he comes before a Mercy-Seat.&mdash;Though he is forced to acknowledge that if God should mark Iniquity, he could not stand before him; he yet remembers, that <HI>with God there is Forgiveness that he may be feared;</HI> and <HI>that with him there is plenteous Redemption.</HI> &mdash;The true Penitent looks to the Blood of Christ, as what
<PB N="137" REF="005572_0144_0000000000000000">
alone can cleanse away his numerous and aggra|vated Sins; and from thence he takes Encourage|ment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Language, <HI>Wash me throughly from mine Iniquity; and cleanse me from my Sin. Purge me with Hyssop and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter than the Snow.</HI>&mdash;This is the Prospect, which both encourages and invi|gorates his Cries for Mercy; and embitters his Sins to him; and which makes him loath them all, and long for Deliverance from them all.&mdash;<Q>Is God infinitely merciful and ready to forgive (says the penitent Soul) and have I been so basely ungrateful, as to sin against such astonish|ing Goodness, to affront and abuse such Mercy and Love!&mdash;Is Sin so hateful to God, that he has so severely punished it in the Person of his own dear Son, how vile, how polluted and abo|minable must I then appear, in the Eyes of his Holiness and Justice, that am Nothing but De|filement and Guilt; from the Crown of my Head to the Soles of my Feet, Nothing but Wounds and Bruises and putrifying Sores!&mdash;Has the blessed Saviour suffered his Father's Wrath for my Sins! Have they nailed him to the Cross; and brought him under the Agonies of an ac|cursed Death; and shall I be ever reconciled to my Lusts any more; and go on to crucify the Son of God afresh!&mdash;Is there pardoning Mercy to be had, and shall I flight the Blood of Christ, set light by the gracious Offer, and pe|rish in Sight of a Saviour!&mdash;May I obtain Strength from the Lord Jesus Christ, for Victory and Dominion over my Corruptions; and shall I not both resolve in his Strength against them; and lie at his Foot, that <HI>the Law of the Spirit of
<PB N="138" REF="005572_0145_0000000000000000">
Life in Christ Jesus, may make me free from the Law of Sin and Death!</HI>&mdash;Have I dishonour'd God so much already, loaded my precious Saviour with so many horrible Indignities; and brought such a Weight of Guilt upon my self; and is it not now high Time to bid an utter Defiance to my most darling Lusts, the greatest Enemies to God and my own Soul?</Q>&mdash;Such as this is the Lan|guage of a Gospel-Repentance.&mdash;And tho' there may be a sincere Repentance without full Evidence of an Interest in Christ, there can be none with|out a believing View of the infinite Merit of his Blood; and the Safety of bringing a guilty Soul to that Fountain for Pardon and Cleansing, as I will endeavour to shew you more particularly.</P>
<P>You can't but see the great Distinction, and even Contrariety, between a guilty Flight of Soul <HI>from</HI> God, like <HI>Adam</HI> after his Fall; and a humbling, self-condemning Flight <HI>to</HI> God's pardoning Mercy, like the <HI>Prodigal</HI> when returning to his Father's House:&mdash;Between legal, slavish, self-righteous En|deavours to atone for our Sins, and make our Peace with God; and repairing only to the Blood of Christ for Cleansing from all our Sins:&mdash;Between mourning for our Guilt and Danger; and mour|ning for our Sins, as they are against God, a|gainst a precious Saviour, against infinite Mercy and Love:&mdash;And in a Word, between attempting a new Life by the Strength of our own Resoluti|ons and Endeavours; and looking only to the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for Grace and Strength, as well as Pardon and Preedom from Condemnation.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance flows from an <HI>Aversation</HI> to God and to his holy Law: But an <HI>evangelical</HI> Repen|tance
<PB N="139" REF="005572_0146_0000000000000000">
from <HI>Love</HI> to both.&mdash;The Distress, the Terror and Amazement, that awaken'd Sinners are under, arises from their dreadful Apprehensions of God, and his terrible Justice. They know that they have greatly provoked him, are afraid of his Wrath; and therefore want some Covert, where they may hide themselves from his Presence.&mdash;They might before, perhaps, have some pleasing Apprehensions of God, while they consider'd him as being all Mercy without Justice; and while they could hope for Pardon, and yet live in their Sins. But now, they have some Sense of his Holiness and Justice, he appears an infinite Enemy; and therefore most terrible to their Souls. They are consulting indeed some Way to be at Peace with him; because they are afraid the Controversy will issue in their Destruction. They resolve upon new Obedience, from the same Motives that Slaves obey their severe tyrannical Masters; while the Rule of their Obedience is directly contrary to the Bent, Biass, and Disposition of their Souls.&mdash;Were the Penalty of the Law taken away, their Aversion to it would quickly appear, and they would soon embrace their beloved Lusts, with the same Plea|sure and Delight as formerly.&mdash;This is frequently exemplified in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who wear off their Convicti|ons and Reformations together, and notwithstand|ing all their former religious Appearances, discover the Alienation of their Hearts to God and his Laws, by their sinful and sensual Lives; and (as the A|postle expresseth it) shew themselves <HI>Enemies in their Minds, by their wicked Works.</HI></P>
<P>But on the contrary, the sincere <HI>Gospel-Penitent,</HI> sees as admirable Beauty and Excellency in a Life of Holiness; and therefore groans after higher
<PB N="140" REF="005572_0147_0000000000000000">
Attainments in it.&mdash;He is sensible how much he has transgressed the Law of God, how very far he is departed from the Purity and Holiness of the divine Nature. This is the Burden of his Soul. Hence it is, that he walks in Heaviness, and wa|ters his Couch with Tears.&mdash;He mourns, not be|cause the Law is so strict or the Penalty so severe, for he esteems <HI>the Law to be holy;</HI> and <HI>the Com|mandment holy, just and good:</HI> but he mourns, that though <HI>the Law be spiritual,</HI> he is <HI>carnal, sold under Sin.</HI>&mdash;He mourns, that his Nature is so contrary to God, that his Practice is so contrary to his Will; and that he can make no better Progress in morti|fying the Deeds of the Flesh, in regulating his Af|fections, Appetites and Passions, and in living to God. So that <HI>with the Mind he himself serves the Law of God,</HI> though in much Imperfection; and though by Reason of his remaining Carnality, he is forc'd to acknowledge and lament, that <HI>with the Flesh he serves the Law of Sin.</HI>&mdash;The true Pe|nitent is breathing with the same Earnestness after Sanctification, as after Freedom from Wrath. He don't want to have the Law bend to his Corrup|tions: but to have his Heart and Life fully sub|jected to the Law and Will of God. There is Nothing he so much desires, besides an Interest in Christ and the Favour of God, as a Freedom from Sin, a Proficiency in Faith and Holiness; and a Life of Communion and Fellowship with God.&mdash;<Q>Oh (says the penitent Believer) what a wicked Heart have I, that is so estranged from the holy Nature of God; and from his righteous Law! What a guilty Wretch have I been, who have walked so contrary to the glorious God, have trampled upon his excellent Perfections, violated
<PB N="141" REF="005572_0148_0000000000000000">
his holy Law; and made so near an Approach even to the Nature of the Devil!&mdash;O for the cleansing Efficacy of the Blood of Christ; and the renewing Influences of his holy Spirit, to purify this Sink of Pollution; and to sanctify these depraved Affections of my Soul!&mdash;<HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me!</HI> Let this separating Wall be|tween God and my Soul be broken down!&mdash;Let me be Partaker of the divine Nature; and be brought near to God, whatever else be denied me!&mdash;<HI>O that my Ways were directed, that I might keep thy Statutes! O let me not wander from thy Commandments:</HI> but <HI>deal bountifully with thy Ser|vant, that I may live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> keep thy Word.</HI></Q>&mdash;Such as these are the Aspirations of a sincere Repen|tance. A Language which flows from a true Love to God and his Law; and an earnest Desire of Conformity to both.</P>
<P>But you'll enquire (perhaps) Is there no Differ|ence between Repentance and Love to God?&mdash;Are not these different Graces of the Spirit; and have they not their different Exercises and Ope|rations?&mdash;I answer, Yes; they are truly different and distinct: but they always have a joint-Exercise, in a truly gracious Soul. As Faith is truly distinct from Repentance; and yet every Child of God is a penitent Believer: so is Love likewise distinct from Repentance; and yet neither of these Graces can exist without the other. We cannot truly love God, unless our Sins are made hateful to us in Repentance. We cannot sincerely turn to God, until we value his Favour; and take Pleasure in a Conformity to his Will.&mdash;As these Graces there|fore are joint-Productions of the blessed Spirit in
<PB N="142" REF="005572_0149_0000000000000000">
our Regeneration, so are they joint-Companions in the Exercise of the divine Love.&mdash;From this Reflection you may see the Reason why some of the same Things necessarily occur in this Discourse of Repentance, which you met with in my last Letter, when treating upon the Difference of a true and false Faith.</P>
<P>By these Hints, you may plainly see the very great Difference, between a legal and an evange|lical Penitent.&mdash;The one looks upon God with Dread, Terror and Aversation of Soul. The other mourns his Distance from him; and longs to be more transform'd into his Image and Likeness.&mdash;The one still loves his Sins in his Heart, though he mourns that there is a Law to punish them. The other hates all his Sins without Reserve; and groans under the Burden of them; because they are contrary to God and his holy Law.&mdash;The O|bedience of the one is by mere Constraint. The Imperfections of the other are Matter of continual Grief; and he is constantly longing and striving after greater Degrees of Grace and Holiness.&mdash;The one can find no inward and abiding Compla|cency in the Service of God. The other runs the Ways of his Commandments with Delight; and takes more Pleasure in Obedience, than in any Thing else.</P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance ordinarily flows from <HI>Discouragement</HI> and <HI>Despondency:</HI> But an <HI>evangelical</HI> Repentance from encouraging <HI>Hope.</HI>&mdash;I have al|ready consider'd, how a legal Repentance is ex|cited and maintain'd by Terrors of Conscience; and fearful Apprehensions of the Wrath of God.&mdash;Some indeed by their external Reformations pacify their Consciences, get settled upon their Lees,
<PB N="143" REF="005572_0150_0000000000000000">
and cry Peace to their Souls; and so their Re|pentance and Discouragements both come to an End. But whilst their Concern continues, their desponding Fears are the very Life of it.&mdash;Their Sins, both for Number and Nature, appear dreadful to their affrightned Consciences, as they frequently violate their Purposes and Promises of new Obe|dience. They are therefore afraid, that God will never pardon and accept such Rebels as they have been; and though they dare not neglect Duty, they come with Horror into the Presence of God, as to an inexorable Judge; and have nothing to keep their Souls from sinking into Despair, but their good Designs and Endeavours, which yet are too defective to give them comfortable Hope.&mdash;And what is all this, but a most ungrateful undervaluing the Blood of Christ, limiting the Goodness and Mercy of God; and an implicit denying the Truth of the whole Gospel of God our Saviour?&mdash;Thus they are flying from the Mercy of God, while they pretend to fly to it.&mdash;But I need not enlarge upon this Head, it being so near of Kin to what was observ'd under the last.</P>
<P>I proceed therefore to shew on the other Hand, that though the true <HI>Gospel-Penitent</HI> may have a deeper Impression of the Greatness and atrocious Nature of his Sin and Guilt, than even the awa|ken'd terrified Legalist himself: Yet he dares not yield to any despairing Thoughts of God's Mercy.&mdash;Faith opens the Door of Hope; and therefore the Door of Repentance, as I have observed before. True it is, that the Gospel-Penitent may meet with many discouraging Doubts and Fears: but these are his Infirmity, not his Repentance.&mdash;The Apo|stle tells us, <HI>we are saved by Hope.</HI> That's what
<PB N="144" REF="005572_0151_0000000000000000">
gives Life and Activity to every Grace; and to Repentance in particular, as I've had Occasion to hint before. And it's yet needful to further ob|serve, that though a Fear and Jealousy of our own Sincerity may be consistent with a true Repentance; and perhaps sometimes serves to further its Pro|gress: Yet all Doubts of the Faithfulness of the Gospel-Promises, of the Extensiveness of the di|vine Mercy; or of our Exemption from the Gospel-Offer: All Apprehensions of our not be|ing elected, of our having sinned away the Day of Grace; or of our having sinned against the Holy Ghost: All Imaginations that our Sins are so circum|stanced, as not to admit of pardoning Mercy or the like, these are directly destructive of or inconsistent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Actings of a true Repentance.&mdash;A sincere Penitent looks over the highest Mountains, which are raised before him, by the Greatness of his Sins, his own misgiving Heart, or the Temptations of Satan, into an Ocean of infinite Goodness and Mercy. Thither he will fly; and there he will hope, let his Case appear never so dark; and tho' every Thing seems to make against him. And the more lively and comfortable his Hope is, the more he is humbled and abased for his Sins; and the more vigorous are his Endeavours after a Life of New Obedience.&mdash;As Repentance is a Hatred of and Separation from all Sin without Reserve, it must certainly be a Flight from and an Abhorrence of Unbelief and Despair, the greatest of all Sins. And the further the Soul flies from these, the more is it conform'd to the Gospel of Christ; and the more is it in the Way of Mercy.&mdash;It is not there|fore sufficient, for the sincere Penitent to be sensi|ble, that God is infinitely gracious; and that the
<PB N="145" REF="005572_0152_0000000000000000">
Blood of Christ is infinitely meritorious; and that there is Forgiveness with God for the greatest Sin|ners, if he still maintains some Reserve in his Mind, with Respect to his own Case. But he must be like|wise persuaded, that he either already hath, or that he may obtain, a personal Interest in this redeem|ing pardoning Mercy, in Order to his approaching to God as a Father; and in Order to his being in Love with the Ways of God; and to his serving him with Chearfulness and Delight.&mdash;This is not only necessary, in Order to the first Exercise of a true Repentance: but the sincere Christian will always find, that by whatever Darkness, Difficulty, or Temptation, he is brought into a really dis|couraged desponding Frame, he is thereby rendred so much the more uncapable of godly Sorrow for Sin, of delighting in God, or of a spiritual Perfor|mance of any Duty of Religion.&mdash;We may be jea|lous and distrustful of <HI>ourselves:</HI> but we must not despond and be jealous of <HI>God,</HI> if we would main|tain the Exercise of any saving Grace.&mdash;<Q>I confess (says the truly penitent Soul) that my Sins are like the Stars in the Firmament, and like the Sand on the Sea-shore, for Multitude; that they are of a scarlet and crimson-Dye; and that it is of the infinite Patience of God, that such a guil|ty Wretch is out of Hell: But yet as great, as dreadfully aggravated as my Sins be, the Merit of a Redeemer's Blood is sufficient to atone for them all; and infinite Mercy is still greater than my greatest Sins.&mdash;Though my <HI>Iniquities have abounded,</HI> God has encouraged me to hope, that <HI>his Grace shall abound much more,</HI> to the re|turning Sinner. It must be astonishing Mercy indeed, if I am saved: but such Mercy is offer|ed
<PB N="146" REF="005572_0153_0000000000000000">
in the Gospel: And blessed be God, I am not excluded from that gracious Offer.&mdash;Tho' I have naturally no Power to comply with the Terms, upon which pardoning Mercy is set be|fore me: Yet the Gospel provides a Remedy in that Case also; and I am encouraged to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, for all Supplies of Grace.&mdash;I will therefore cast my guilty Soul at the Footstool of a sovereign God, and rely on in|finite Mercy through a Redeemer. I will de|pend upon the Blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all Sin. I will constantly repair to his Fulness, that from thence I may receive, even Grace for Grace; and in that Way, I will hope for that blessed Sentence from his gracious Mouth, <HI>Thy Sins which be many, are forgiven thee.</HI>&mdash;O how will Mercy triumph over such Sins as mine! How great Glory will God bring to the Riches of his infinite Grace in the Salvation of such a Sinner as I, if ever I am saved! How will Hea|ven ring with eternal Hallelujahs on my Account!&mdash;Surely I have sinned enough already. Let me no more add to the Number and Guilt of my Sins, by Distrust of God's Mercy, or by doubt|ing the Faithfulness of his Invitations and Pro|mises.&mdash;Whether I have already obtain'd a sav|ing Interest in Christ or not, I am resolved to hope in his Mercy; and to ly at his Feet, what|ever the Issue be.</Q></P>
<P>So great is the Difference between a legal and an evangelical Repentance: as great as between de|sponding Fear and encouraging Hope, as between being affrighted by a Sight of our Sins, into an Incapacity to trust God or serve him with Delight, and being allured by his infinite Mercy to seek his
<PB N="147" REF="005572_0154_0000000000000000">
Favour, expect Forgiveness through the Blood of his Son; and to serve him with the Disposition of Children.</P>
<P N="5">5. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance <HI>is temporary;</HI> wearing off with the Convictions of Conscience, which occasion it: but an <HI>evangelical</HI> Repentance is the <HI>daily Exercise</HI> of the true Christian.&mdash;We have too sad and nu|merous Instances of such, who will for a while ap|pear under the greatest Remorse for their Sins; and yet quickly wear off all their Impressions, and return to the same Course of Impiety and Sen|suality, which occasion'd their Distress and Terror; and thereby declare to the World, that their Good|ness like <HI>Ephraim's,</HI> was but <HI>a Morning Cloud and an early Dew.</HI>&mdash;And besides these, there seem to be some who quiet their Consciences, and speak Peace to their Souls, from their having been in Distress and Terror for their Sins, from their Reformation of some grosser Immoralities, and from a formal Course of Duty. They have repented, they think, and there|fore conclude themselves at Peace with God; &amp; seem to have no great Care and Concern about, either their former Impieties, or their daily Transgres|sions. They conclude themselves in a converted State; and are therefore easy, careless and secure.&mdash;These may think and perhaps speak loftily of their Experiences, they may be blown up with joyful Apprehensions of their safe State: but have no Impressions of their Sins, no Mourning after Pardon, no Groaning under the Burthen of a wick|ed Heart, imperfect Duties, and renewed Provoca|tions against God, I fear, we have too many such in the present Times, who will go on <HI>flattering them|selves in their own Eyes, until their Iniquities are found hateful.</HI>&mdash;I might add, there are many that while
<PB N="148" REF="005572_0155_0000000000000000">
under the Stings of an awaken'd Conscience, will be driven to maintain a solemn Watch over their Hearts and Lives, to be afraid of every Sin, to be conscienciously careful to attend every known Duty; and to be serious and in earnest in the Per|formance of it. Now, By this imaginary Progress in Religion they gradually wear off their Con|victions, and get from under the Terrors of the Law; and then their Watchfulness and Tenderness of Conscience are forgot: They attend their Du|ties in a careless Manner, with a trifling remiss Frame of Soul, while the great Concerns of an un|seen eternal World are but little in their Minds; and all their Religion is reduced to a mere cold Formality. They still maintain the Form; but are unconcern'd about the Power of Godliness.&mdash;In some such Manner, a legal Repentance always leaves the Soul short of a real sanctifying saving Change.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, a saving <HI>evangelical</HI> Repen|tance is a lasting Principle of humble, self-abasing, self-condemning Mourning for, and Abhorrence of all the Sins which the Penitent discovers, both in his Heart and Life.&mdash;The true Penitent don't forget his past Sins; and grow careless and unconcerned about them, as soon as he obtains Peace in his Conscience, and a comforting Hope that he is reconciled to God: but the clearer Evidences he obtains of the divine Favour, the more does he loathe, abhor, and condemn himself for his Sins, the more vile does he appear in his own Eyes; and the more aggravated and enormous do his past Sins represent themselves to him.&mdash;A Sense of pardoning Mercy makes <HI>Paul</HI> appear to himself <HI>the chief of Sinners,</HI> and speak of himself as a Pattern
<PB N="149" REF="005572_0156_0000000000000000">
of Hope, to all that shall come after him.&mdash;The true Penitent not only continues to abhor himself on Account of his past Guilt and Defilement: but finds daily Cause to renew his Repentance before God. He finds so much Deadness, Formality and Hypocrisy in his Duties, so much Carnality, World|ly-mindedness; and Unbelief in his Heart, so much Prevalence of his sinful Affections, Appetites and Passions; and so many Foils by the Sin that ea|sily besets him; that he cannot but <HI>groan, being bur|thened, while he is in this Tabernacle.</HI> Repentance therefore is the daily continued Exercise of the Christian indeed, until he puts off Mortality.&mdash;He will not leave off repenting, till he leaves off sinning; which is not attainable on this Side Hea|ven.&mdash;<Q>Have I Hope (says the penitent Soul) that God has pardon'd my Sins? What an In|stance of pardoning Mercy is this! How ado|rable is that wonderful Grace, which has pluckt such a Brand out of the Fire! And am I still daily offending against such Mercy and Love! Am I still so formal, lifeless and hypocritical! Am I yet doing so little for him, who has done so much for me! Ah vile sinful Heart! Ah base Ingratitude to such amazing Goodness! Oh for more Victory over my Corruptions; for more Thankfulness for such Mercies, for more Spirituality and Heavenly-mindedness!&mdash;How often have I been mourning my Infirmi|ties; and must I yet have Cause to mourn over the same Defects! How often pursuing and designing a closer Walk with God; but what a poor Progress do I yet make, save in Desires and Endeavours!&mdash;How would the Iniquities of my best Duties separate between God and my Soul
<PB N="150" REF="005572_0157_0000000000000000">
ever, had I not the Redeemer's Merit to plead! What need have I, every Day, to have this pol|luted Soul washed in the Blood of Christ; and to repair to the glorious Advocate with the Fa|ther, for the Benefit of his Intercession!&mdash;Not a Step can I take in my spiritual Progress, with|out fresh Supplies from the Fountain of Grace and Strength; and yet how often am I provo|king him to withdraw his Influences, in whom <HI>is</HI> all my Hope and Confidence! <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI></Q>&mdash;Thus the true Penitent <HI>goes with his Face Zion-ward, mourning as he goes.</HI> And thus in his highest Attainments of Comfort and Joy, will he find Cause to be deeply humbled before God; and to wrestle with him for renewed Pardon; and new Supplies of strengthening and quickening Grace.</P>
<P>The Difference between these two Sorts of Pe|nitents is very apparent.&mdash;There is the same Dif|ference, as between the running of Water in the Paths after a Shower, and the Streams flowing from a living Fountain of Water: A legal Repentance lasting no longer than the Terrors which occasion it, but an evangelical Repentance being a continued War with Sin, till Death sounds the Retreat.&mdash;Once more,</P>
<P N="6">6. A <HI>legal</HI> Repentance does at most produce, only a <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>external Reformation:</HI> but an <HI>evangeli|cal</HI> Repentance is a total Change of <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>universal</HI> turning from Sin to God.&mdash;As some particular more gross Iniquities most commonly lead the Way to that Distress and Terror, which is the Life of a legal and insincere Repentance: so a Re|formation of those Sins too frequently wears off
<PB N="151" REF="005572_0158_0000000000000000">
the Impression, and gives Peace and Rest to the troubled Conscience, without any further Change.&mdash;Or at best, there will be some darling Lusts retain'd some right Hand or right Eye spared, some sweet Morsel rolled under the Tongue.&mdash;If the legal Pe|nitent be afraid of the Sins of Commission, he may still live in the Omission or the careless Performance of known Duty.&mdash;Or if he be more forward in the Duties of God's immediate Worship, he may still live in Acts of Injustice, Strife, and Uncharitable|ness towards Men.&mdash;If he shews some Zeal and Activity in the Service of God, he will yet (per|haps) have his Heart and Affections inordinately glewed to the World; and pursue it as the Object of his chief Desire and Delight.&mdash;If he makes Conscience of all open actual Sins, he yet little re|gards the Sins of his Heart, but lives in Envy, Malice, Pride, Carnal-mindedness, Unbelief; or some other such Heart-defiling Sin.&mdash;To finish his Character, whatever seeming Progress he may make in Religion, his <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>not right with God:</HI> but is still going after his Idols, still estranged from vital Christianity &amp; the Power of Godliness. Like <HI>Ephraim,</HI> he is <HI>as a Cake not turned,</HI> neither Bread nor Dough; or like <HI>Laodicea, Lukewarm, neither hot nor cold.</HI></P>
<P>If we proceed to view the Character of the sincere Penitent, it is directly contrary to this.&mdash;He finds indeed (as has been observ'd) continual Occasion to lament the great Imperfections of his Heart and Life; and accordingly seeks renewed Pardon and Cleansing in the Blood of Christ. But though he has <HI>not already attained, nor is already perfect,</HI> he is yet <HI>pressing towards Perfection.</HI> He is yet watching, striving against all his Corruptions; yet aiming at and endeavouring after further Con|formity
<PB N="152" REF="005572_0159_0000000000000000">
to God, in all holy Conversation and God|liness.&mdash;He is never satisfied with a partial Refor|mation, with external Duty; or with any Thing short of a Life of vital Piety.&mdash;He does not re|nounce one Lust, and retain another; content him|self with first-Table-Duties, in the Neglect of the second; nor quiet himself in a Life of mere for|mal Godliness; nor can he rest, till he <HI>rejoices in the Testimony of his Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God, he has his Conversation in the World.</HI>&mdash;All the Actings of his Mind, as well as his exter|nal Conduct, fall under his strictest Cognizance and Inspection; and he is awfully careful to approve himself to him, who <HI>knows his Thoughts afar off.</HI>&mdash;His Reformation extends not only to the Devotions of the Church, but of his Family and Closets; not only to his Conversation, but to his Thoughts and Affections; not only to the Worship of God, but to the Duties of every Relation he sustains a|mong Men; and in a Word, his Repentance pro|duces Heavenly-mindedness, Humility, Meekness, Charity, Patience, Forgiving of Injuries, Self-De|nial; and is accompany'd with all other Fruits and Graces of the blessed Spirit.&mdash;<Q>It is the Desire of my Soul (says the sincere Penitent) to keep the Way of the Lord; and not wickedly to depart from my God. I would refrain my Feet from every evil Way; and walk within my House with a perfect Heart.&mdash;I know I have to do with a God who trieth the Heart; and hath Pleasure in Uprightness; I would therefore set the Lord always before me; and serve him with a perfect Heart and with a will|ing Mind.&mdash;I know that my Heart is deceitful
<PB N="153" REF="005572_0160_0000000000000000">
above all Things; and desperately wicked. I know that mine Iniquities are ascended over mine Head; for which I am bowed down great|ly; and go mourning all the Day long. But yet my Desire is before the Lord; and my Groaning is not hid from him.&mdash;I can truly say, that I even hate vain Thoughts: but God's Law do I love. O that God would give me Under|standing, that I may keep his Law, and observe it with my whole Heart!&mdash;I would be for God without any Reserve: for I esteem his Precepts concerning all Things to be right, and I have inclined my Heart to keep his Statutes always, even unto the End.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, herein lies the great Difference between a legal and an evangelical Repentance: The one is an external Reformation only, destitute of all the Graces of the blessed Spirit. The other is an internal Change, a Change of the Heart, of the Will and Affections, as well as of the outward Conversation; a Change which is accompanied with all the Fruits and Graces of the Spirit of God.&mdash;The one aims at just so much Religion as will keep the Mind easy; and calm the Ruffles of an awa|kened Conscience. The other aims at a holy, humble, watchful, and spiritual Walk with God; and rests in no Degree of Attainments whatsoever.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you a general View of the <HI>Difference</HI> between a <HI>legal</HI> and an <HI>evangelical</HI> Repentance.&mdash;You have not demanded this of me out of mere Curiosity; or as a Matter of Specu|lation only: but in Order to the Exercise and Practice of a <HI>Repentance unto Life, not to be repen|ted of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="005572_0161_0000000000000000">You should therefore remember <HI>Who</HI> is exalted at God's right Hand, to <HI>give Repentance,</HI> as well as Forgiveness of Sins. Remember that you must depend only upon the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ; and must accordingly ly at his Footstool, to have this great and important Change wrought in your Heart.&mdash;And therefore, since you depend upon the mere sovereign Grace of God in Christ, for the renewing Influences of his Holy Spirit, you should be the more importunate in your Cries to him, in the Language of <HI>Ephraim, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.</HI></P>
<P>You should endeavour to review your past Sins, and as particularly as you can, acknowledge them before God with all their heinous Circumstances and peculiar Aggravations; and you should with peculiar Ardor of Soul wrestle with him, for Par|don and Cleansing in the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>You should endeavour to see and be affected with the Sin of your Nature, as well as of your Practice, of your Heart as well as of your Life; and with constant Fervency cry to God for a new Heart and a right Spirit, for Victory over your Corruptions; and for Grace to approve your self to God in a Life of new Obedience, as well as for Pardon and Reconciliation to him.</P>
<P>You should be daily calling your self to an Ac|count for your daily Sins and Imperfections; and daily confessing and lamenting them before God, that you may never have so much as the Sins of one Day unrepented of.</P>
<P>Though it be impossible, that you can be suffi|ciently humbled before God, under an abasing Sense of your great Sinfulness, Unworthiness, and In|gratitude to him: Yet remember that <HI>faithful Say|ing,
<PB N="155" REF="005572_0162_0000000000000000">
which is worthy of all Acceptation, that Christ Je|sus came to save Sinners.</HI>&mdash;Don't dishonour the in|finite Merit of the Redeemer's Blood by being a|fraid to trust to it, for Pardon and Sanctification. Don't dishonour the infinite Compassion of the di|vine Nature, by calling into Question his being as ready to grant, as you heartily to seek Pardon and Forgiveness of all your Sins, how many and great soever they be.&mdash;Be therefore humbled: but not discouraged. While you lament your Sin and Im|perfection, adore the infinite Riches of that Grace and Love, which has <HI>open'd a Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness.</HI></P>
<P>And to sum up the whole in a Word: You must remember, that it is the Essence of a true Repen|tance, to <HI>turn to God;</HI> and therefore if you would evidence the Sincerity of your Repentance, you must give up your self to <HI>God.</HI> You must chuse him for <HI>your</HI> God and Portion. You must watch at his Gates; and wait at the Posts of his Doors. You must make a Business of Religion; and in a Life of most active and earnest Diligence, expect Acceptance through the Merits of Christ; and continued Supplies of Grace and Strength from his Fulness, to <HI>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lord would carry on his own Work in your Soul; and lead you from Grace to Grace, and from Strength to Strength, till you arrive where your Faith will be turn'd into Vision, and your Repentance into eternal Praises, is the Prayer of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Can't but take Comfort, from your melancholy Complaint of the Corruptions you are strug|gling with; and your Sense of the Vileness and Sinfulness of your Heart, which makes you <HI>groan being burthened:</HI> because you therein breathe the Language of a <HI>broken and a contrite Spirit;</HI> and give me Hopes that you are offering to God <HI>the Sacri|fice, which he will not despise.</HI>&mdash;<Q><HI>You took Comfort</HI> (you tell me) <HI>from the Seventh Chapter to the</HI> Ro|mans, <HI>finding there, the like Complaints with yours, in so eminent and exalted a Christian as the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>himself: But that Prop is knock'd from under you, by Conversation with some Persons of a supe|rior Reputation for Religion, who assure you, that</HI> St. Paul <HI>is there giving the Character of an uncon|verted Person, under a Conflict between his Corrup|tions and the Alarms of an awakened Conscience; and that all those Places of Scripture are to be inter|preted in the same Manner, which represent the like Conflict in the Soul.</HI></Q>&mdash;Upon which you desire my Sentiments.</P>
<P>What strange Efforts are of late made against <HI>evangelical, vital</HI> and <HI>experimental</HI> Piety! How in|consistent are the Methods used by those, who are
<PB N="157" REF="005572_0164_0000000000000000">
so earnestly labouring in this Undertaking! Is it not enough, to put Mankind into a dangerous Se|curity, by flattering them with a Prospect of Safe|ty, without any Experience of a Work of Grace in their Hearts; but they must also torment and disquiet the Minds of those who have been fa|vour'd with those blessed Experiences, by perswa|ding them, that remaining disallowed Corruptions and Imperfections are inconsistent with a State of Grace, and with the Favour of God!&mdash;What do these Men mean! Have they no feeling Percep|tion, no affecting Sense of the Imperfections of their Hearts and Lives! Or do they make it their Practice, and esteem it their Duty, to give their Corruptions a quiet Residence in their Hearts, and to maintain no Conflict or Struggle with them!</P>
<P>But it's my Business to answer your Demand; and to endeavour to convince you, that the Apos|tle in the <HI>seventh</HI> Chapter to the ROMANS, is descri|bing the <HI>Conflict,</HI> which every <HI>true Christian</HI> expe|riences, while he walks with God and lives near to him.</P>

<HI>through Faith</HI> in Christ.&mdash;This Doctrine is proved, by a Representation of the atrocious Impiety and Wickedness of the whole <HI>Gentile</HI> World; that e|ven they who make the highest Pretences to Inno|cence, and who judge and censure others for such horrid Impieties, as are commonly practised among them, are all inexcusable and self-condemned, on Account of the Wickedness perpetrated and indul|ged by themselves; being all of them such Vio|laters of the Law and Light of Nature, as will leave them <HI>without Excuse in the Day when God shall judge the Secrets of Men by Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;This is plainly the Apostle's Argument, from the 18th <HI>Verse</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> Chapter, to the 17th Verse of the <HI>second</HI> Chap|ter. Whence it follows, that the <HI>Gentile</HI> World cannot possibly have any Claim to <HI>Justification,</HI> by their own personal Obedience; nor any other Way, but by <HI>the Righteousness of Christ</HI> received by <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle next proceeds to shew, that the <HI>Jew</HI> has no better Plea to make for his Acceptance with God, on Account of his own personal Righ|teousness, than the <HI>Gentile,</HI> though <HI>he rests in the Law, and makes his Boast of God, knows his Will, and approves the Things that are most excellent.</HI> For <HI>be</HI> also, in his highest natural Attainments, <HI>breaks the Law, dishonours</HI> GOD, and at the best performs but an external Obedience, and reaches not to the <HI>Spi|rituality,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> requires.&mdash;The <HI>Jew</HI> has indeed <HI>much every Way the Advantage,</HI> in Point of external <HI>Privilege:</HI> But in Point of justifying <HI>Righ|teousness,</HI> he cannot be said to be <HI>better</HI> than the <HI>Gentile; no, in no wise!</HI>&mdash;This is the Argument from the 17th Verse of the <HI>second,</HI> to the 9th Verse of the <HI>third</HI> Chapter. In which Verse and those
<PB N="159" REF="005572_0166_0000000000000000">
following, the Apostle sums up the Argument, in these remarkable Words, which fully justify my Interpretation of his Scope and Design: <HI>For we have before proved, both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin. As it is written, there is none righteous; no, not one,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>That every Mouth may be stopped, and all the World may become guilty before God.</HI> &mdash;From these Premises, he draws this Conclusion in the 20th Verse of the iiid Chapter, &amp;<HI>c. Therefore by the Deeds of the Law shall no Flesh living be jus|tified in his Sight. For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin. But now the Righteousness of God, without the Law, is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; even the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no Difference. Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus.&mdash;Therefore we conclude, that a Man is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> &mdash;Which was the Point to be proved.</P>
<P>But here may arise a <HI>Question:</HI> What <HI>Law</HI> is it, that the Apostle excludes from having any Hand in our <HI>Justification?</HI> To which it is answered: All the <HI>Law,</HI> that was obligatory both upon <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> For they were both obnoxious to <HI>Wrath,</HI> by their Violation of the respective Laws they were under; had <HI>all sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</HI>&mdash;And God deals with them all alike. He will justify them all by their <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and no otherwise: and thereby shew, that <HI>he is not the God of the</HI> Jews <HI>only, but of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>also.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus concluded his first Argument; and proved from the Guilt and Impotence both of <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> that no Man can be justified by the
<PB N="160" REF="005572_0167_0000000000000000">
<HI>Law</HI> of Nature, by the Law which was given to the <HI>Jews;</HI> nor any other Way, but by <HI>the Righte|ousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;The Apostle proceeds to prove the same Thing from ABRAHAM'S <HI>Faith being imputed to him for Righ|teousness;</HI> and from DAVID'S <HI>describing the Blessed|ness of the Man, to whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works,</HI> throughtout the <HI>fourth</HI> Chapter.</P>
<P>He then begins the <HI>fifth</HI> Chapter, by describing the glorious <HI>Privileges</HI> of those, who are thus <HI>jus|tified by Faith;</HI> and ends it by shewing in what <HI>Manner</HI> we partake of the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ, for our Justification: That it is in the <HI>same</HI> Man|ner, as we are Partakers of the Sin and Guilt of <HI>Adam,</HI> to our Condemnation.&mdash;As <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin was imputed to all whom he represented, unto their <HI>Condemnation:</HI> so the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> is imputed to all whom he represented, and who be|lieve in him, <HI>unto Justification of Life. As by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners: so by the Obedience of one, many shall be made Righteous.</HI></P>
<P>After a solemn Caution unto all, not to turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, and not to <HI>conti|nue in Sin, that Grace may abound;</HI> and after enfor|cing this Caution, from the Obligation we are un|der by our Baptism, <HI>to die unto Sin,</HI> and <HI>walk in Newness of Life, as Christ died for us, and rose again from the dead,</HI> (as in the first Part of the sixth Chap|ter) the Apostle goes on to shew (in the latter Part of that Chapter) what was the privileged happy State of these <HI>Romans,</HI> to whom he wrote: That <HI>Sin had not Dominion over them; for they were not under the Law, but under Grace:</HI> That they were <HI>made free from Sin, and were become the Servants of Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;And then throughout the whole
<PB N="161" REF="005572_0168_0000000000000000">
<HI>seventh</HI> Chapter, and the Beginning of the <HI>eighth,</HI> he illustrates this Matter; and shews in what Re|spect they are <HI>not under the Law,</HI> and how, or in what Respects they are made <HI>free from Sin.</HI></P>
<P>This, Sir, appears plainly to be the Scope and Connection of the first <HI>seven</HI> Chapters of the E|pistle to the <HI>Romans;</HI> as may be easily observ'd by any one, that will impartially look into the Case, without Prejudice in Favour of a Party; or a pre|conceived Opinion, which he is resolved to main|tain.</P>
<P>And thus I am come to a more particular Con|sideration of this <HI>seventh</HI> Chapter; which (as was observ'd) is designed to clear up these two Things, How we are made <HI>free from the Law,</HI> and, How we are made <HI>free from Sin, and become the Servants of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> Thing consider'd by the Apostle in this Chapter is, in what Respects these believing <HI>Romans</HI> were <HI>under Grace, and not under the Law.</HI>&mdash;But previous to a direct Attendance to this, it will be necessary to remove a Stumbling-Block out of the Way, by considering again, what <HI>Law</HI> it is that the Apostle refers to, when he declares these Ro|mans <HI>not to be under the Law, but under Grace; to be dead to the Law; and to be delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein they were held.</HI> Does he herein speak of the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law, or of the <HI>Moral</HI> Law; or of <HI>both?</HI></P>
<P>To this I answer: The Apostle here speaks of the <HI>Law</HI> in the same Sense, and uses the Word in the same Extent of Signification, as in the forego|ing Parts of this Epistle.&mdash;'Tis the Scope and De|sign of this Epistle (as I have shewn you) to prove that both <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI> must be justified only
<PB N="162" REF="005572_0169_0000000000000000">
by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST, received by <HI>Faith;</HI> and not by their own Observance of any <HI>Law,</HI> which they are under.&mdash;The <HI>Law</HI> therefore in Question is that <HI>Law, which the</HI> Gentiles <HI>have writ|ten in their Hearts;</HI> and that <HI>Law, which the</HI> Jews <HI>rest in, boasting themselves of God.</HI> Chap. ii. 14, 15,
17.&mdash;It is that <HI>Law,</HI> by the Violation whereof <HI>both</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles <HI>are all under Sin;</HI> and against which <HI>all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</HI> Chap. iii. 9, 23.&mdash;It is that <HI>Law, without which there could be no Transgression.</HI> Chap. iv. 15.&mdash;And in a Word, that <HI>Law, by which every Mouth may be stopped, and all the World become guilty before God.</HI> Chap. iii. 19.&mdash;The <HI>Law</HI> therefore here must be taken in the largest Extent of the Word, including the <HI>whole Will</HI> of GOD, any Manner of Way mani|fested, to any and every Part of Mankind, whe|ther <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile.</HI> Though it is evident, that the Apostle hath in this <HI>seventh</HI> Chapter a special Reference to the <HI>moral Law.</HI>&mdash;This appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. Because the <HI>Law</HI> here referred to, is what these believing <HI>Romans</HI> had <HI>been married to,</HI> and <HI>been held by;</HI> as appears in the 4th and 6th Verses. Now these <HI>Romans</HI> to whom the Apostle wrote, were most of them (if not all of them) <HI>Gentiles;</HI> as he expressly declares, <HI>Chap. i. 13.</HI> and <HI>Chap. xi. 13.</HI> and were therefore never <HI>married</HI> to the <HI>Levitical</HI> or ce|remonial <HI>Law,</HI> never <HI>held by it;</HI> and consequently never <HI>delivered</HI> from it. It was the <HI>moral Law</HI> only to which <HI>they</HI> had been married; and from that only they were therefore made <HI>free:</HI> and that, consequently, must be what the Apostle especially refers to, in this Chapter.</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the Apostle, in Exemplification of his Meaning, instances in the <HI>moral Law,</HI> and no
<PB N="163" REF="005572_0170_0000000000000000">
other: The <HI>Law,</HI> by which <HI>Concupiscence is known,</HI> and which <HI>forbids coveting,</HI> Verse 7th. The <HI>Law,</HI> which is <HI>spiritual,</HI> Verse 14th. Whereas, the ce|remonial Law, consider'd in it self, was not <HI>spiri|tual,</HI> but made up of <HI>carnal Ordinances,</HI> Heb. ix. 10.&mdash;It is the <HI>Law,</HI> in which the Apostle <HI>delighted, af|ter the inward Man,</HI> Verse 22d. But he was so far from taking Delight in the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law, that he strongly and pathetically exclaims against the Ob|servation of it now that Christ is come, and repre|sents the Ordinances of this Law, to be become now <HI>beggarly Elements,</HI> Gal. iv. 9, and forward.</P>
<P>In Fine, he instances in that <HI>Law</HI> of God, which he himself <HI>served with his Mind,</HI> Verse 25th. But his Heart was not so set upon the Observation of the ceremonial <HI>Law,</HI> as to <HI>desire to be again brought into Bondage to it.</HI>&mdash;From all which it is evident, if Demonstration may be taken for Evidence, that it is the <HI>moral Law,</HI> which is principally designed by the Apostle in this Chapter and Context, when he tells us, that no Man can be justified by the <HI>Law;</HI> and that Believers are made free from the <HI>Law,</HI> by their Interest in Christ.</P>
<P>I am now prepar'd to consider, in what Respects the Apostle here represents Believers to be <HI>freed from the Law, or to be not under the Law.</HI>&mdash;And to set this Matter in the clearest Light, it will be pro|per to consider it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Negatively:</HI> Shewing in what Sense they are <HI>not</HI> here represented, as being <HI>freed from the Law.</HI> Particularly then,</P>
<P>They are not represented to be freed from the <HI>Law,</HI> as it is a <HI>Rule</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Conduct. No! <HI>The Law is holy; and the Commandment holy, and just
<PB N="164" REF="005572_0171_0000000000000000">
and good,</HI> Verse 12th. Believers <HI>consent to the Law, that it is good,</HI> Verse 16th. And <HI>with their Mind they serve the Law of God,</HI> Verse 25th.</P>
<P>They are not freed from <HI>Endeavours</HI> after, and <HI>Delight in</HI> Obedience to the Law of God. <HI>To will is present with them,</HI> even beyond their Capacity of Performance, Verse 18th. <HI>They would do good,</HI> e|ven when <HI>Evil is present with them;</HI> and <HI>they de|light in the Law of God, after the inward Man,</HI> Ver. 21st, and 22d.</P>
<P>I add, they are not freed from being <HI>grieved</HI> and <HI>burthened,</HI> on the Account of the <HI>Imperfection</HI> of their Obedience to the Law of God: but must, on that Account, <HI>groan being burthened, while they are here in this Tabernacle;</HI> and must cry out with the Apostle, <HI>O wretched Man, that I am: who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> Verse 24th. And now let us attend,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the <HI>affirmative</HI> Description here given, of the Believer's <HI>Freedom</HI> from the <HI>Law</HI> of God.</P>
<P>They are here represented as freed from their <HI>Marriage Relation</HI> to the <HI>Law;</HI> or from the Obli|gations of it, as a <HI>Covena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of Life.&mdash;While in their carnal and unregenerate State, they were un|der the strictest Bonds of Subjection to the Law of Nature, or the moral Law. It rigorously ex|acted perfect Obedience of 'em, as the only Con|dition of their Acceptance with God: and conti|nuing in that State, they could have no Righteous|ness at all to plead, but their own Conformity to the whole Demands of the Law; and they must obtain eternal Life by perfect Obedience, or not at all.&mdash;But now that Marriage-Covenant is dissol|ved, by their Faith in Christ. They <HI>are become dead to the Law, by the Body of Christ, that they
<PB N="165" REF="005572_0172_0000000000000000">
should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead.</HI> They <HI>are deliver'd from the Law, that being dead in which they were held.</HI> Verses 4th and 6th.&mdash;They have therefore another Righteousness to plead, without a perfect personal Conformity to the <HI>Law;</HI> and their Hope of Salvation is held by another Tenure, built upon another Foundation, an <HI>Espousal</HI> to CHRIST, the one only <HI>Husband,</HI> that is able to pay their Debts to offended Justice, and save them to the uttermost.&mdash;They may now <HI>serve God in Newness of Spirit,</HI> from a new Principle, from new Motives, with new Affections, and with new Hopes: and not in the <HI>Oldness of the Letter.</HI> Ver. 6th.&mdash;Not from any Expectation, that <HI>by doing these Things</HI> they should <HI>live in them;</HI> nor under the Terror of the dreadful <HI>Curses,</HI> pronounced against <HI>every one who continues not in all Things, written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> This is evidently the Design of the first <HI>six</HI> Verses of this Chapter.</P>
<P>Moreover, they are <HI>freed</HI> from that <HI>Spirit of Bon|dage,</HI> which they were once under, when their Guilt, Danger and Misery were brought to their View by the <HI>Law.</HI> This the Apostle exemplifies, by representing his own State, when under a Law|Work.&mdash;<HI>For I was alive without the Law once: but when the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died; and the Commandment which was ordain'd to Life, I found to be unto Death,</HI> Verses 9th, and 10th. That is, I thought my self <HI>once alive,</HI> was in a State of Safety and without the Curse in my own Appre|hension, while ignorant or thoughtless of the Spi|rituality, Extent, and Terror of the <HI>Law</HI> of God: but when the <HI>Commandment came</HI> home to my Con|science, and I found what my State truly was, <HI>Sin revived,</HI> rose up against me in its condemning
<PB N="166" REF="005572_0173_0000000000000000">
Power, or appeared to me in its own Nature and Aggravations, <HI>exceeding sinful;</HI> for <HI>by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin:</HI> and so I found my self to be a guilty Creature, <HI>a dead</HI> Man, indeed <HI>under the Law,</HI> under its Curse and damning Sentence; and <HI>died</HI> to self-slattering Hope, and Confidence in the Flesh. Now this is the very Case of all awaken'd Sinners, when the <HI>Law</HI> comes near to Conscience, lays the Weight of their Guilt upon them, and sets their Danger of everlasting Punishment before them.&mdash;But now these believing <HI>Romans</HI> were de|livered from this <HI>Bondage</HI> to the <HI>Law;</HI> there be|ing <HI>no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Je|sus;</HI> and <HI>that being dead, wherein they were held.</HI></P>
<P>I may add to this, that they were also <HI>freed</HI> from the <HI>irritating</HI> Power of the <HI>Law.</HI> &mdash;When an awak|ned Sinner first obtains a sensible View of the Strictness, Purity, and Spirituality of the <HI>Law,</HI> so of the vast Number and dreadful Aggravations of his <HI>Sins,</HI> with the amazing <HI>Wrath</HI> that hangs over his Head; this fills his Soul not only with Horror and Amazement, but with an impatient disquieting Anxiety, which unhinges his Mind for Duty, in|flames his Corruptions; and gives them the Ad|vantage against all his good Purposes, Resolves, and Endeavours. So that the <HI>Law,</HI> inhibiting Sin, without giving Power to avoid it, does but make the Sinner's <HI>Lusts</HI> (like a Torrent damm'd up) to swell the more, and to run with greater Force, when they get Vent: and <HI>Sin taking Occasion by the Commandment, works in the Soul all Manner of Concupiscence, deceives</HI> the Sinner, <HI>and flays him,</HI> as it is expressed, Verses 8th, and 11th.&mdash;But these believing <HI>Romans</HI> were <HI>delivered</HI> from the <HI>Law</HI> in this Respect also. Having a Discovery of the
<PB N="167" REF="005572_0174_0000000000000000">
glorious Way of Salvation by Christ, and the Safe|ty of depending upon his Righteousness, they were quickned by adoring Views of redeeming Mercy; acted by a Principle of Love to God; and strength|ned, by the divine Influences of the Spirit of Grace, to mortify their Lusts, and to live a Life of sincere and spiritual Obedience; or as the A|postle expresses it (Verse 6.) to <HI>serve God in New|ness of Spirit; and not in the Oldness of the Letter.</HI></P>
<P>These three Things are most certainly represen|ted in the Context, as the Servitude, that unrege|nerate Men are under to the <HI>Law.</HI>&mdash;This is too evident to be disputed. Believers are certainly re|presented, as being delivered from the <HI>Servitude</HI> of the Law: Whence it follows, that their <HI>Freedom</HI> from the <HI>Law,</HI> here treated of, must consist in these Particulars which I have consider'd.</P>
<P>And now, I am further to observe to you, that there is another glorious Privilege of Believers, distinctly insisted upon in the <HI>sixth Chapter,</HI> which is (as I hinted before) particularly illustrated in this. And that is, that they are <HI>dead unto Sin; and alive unto God. Sin has no more Dominion over them,</HI> they <HI>being not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI> They are <HI>made free from Sin, and become the Servants of Righteousness:</HI> And <HI>being made free from Sin, they are become Servants of God, have their Fruit unto Ho|liness, and the End everlasting Life.</HI> Chap. vi. 11, 14, 18, 22.&mdash;This Character of Believers depends upon the other already consider'd. They being made free from the <HI>Law,</HI> they are of Consequence made free from <HI>Sin</HI> likewise. A Freedom from <HI>Sin</HI> is the Fruit of our Freedom from the <HI>Law;</HI> which is therefore first consider'd, and the Consi|deration of this superadded as an Appendage to it, or a necessary Consequence from it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="005572_0175_0000000000000000">But how are we to understand these strong E|xressions? Are Believers wholly freed from all Sin? Are they arrived to a sinless State of Perfection! Or in what other Sense are they <HI>free from Sin, and become Servants of Righteousness?</HI> This Question the Apostle answers, from the 14th Verse of the <HI>seventh,</HI> to the 3d Verse of the <HI>eighth</HI> Chapter; and particularly exemplifies the Case, by represen|ting to us the State of his own Soul, with Respect to his Freedom from Sin; and the remaining Con|flict he yet had with his Corruptions.&mdash;In the fore|going Verses he had shewn us, what he <HI>once</HI> was, when in a carnal State, and under the Tyranny of the <HI>Law.&mdash;I was alive without the Law once,</HI> &amp;c. And throughout that Discourse, he speaks wholly in the <HI>Preterperfect</HI> Tense, as of former Matters, Things already pass'd.&mdash;From the 14th Verse and forward, he shews us what he <HI>now</HI> is; and speaks there|fore only in the <HI>present</HI> Tense, as being to describe his new State of Freedom from Sin.&mdash;By altering thus his Form of Expression, in this Change of <HI>Tenses,</HI> we may plainly see, that there is such a <HI>Tran|sition,</HI> as I am now supposing; and may easily know where it begins.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured to set before you in the briefest and plainest Manner I could, the Scope and Connection of the first <HI>seven Chapters</HI> of this Epistle to the <HI>Romans.</HI> By a due Attendance to which, you cannot but discover, how groundless and impertinent all the Reasoning of those Gen|tlemen are, of whom you speak.</P>
<P>However, that this may appear in a yet stronger Light, I will now proceed to a direct <HI>Refutation</HI> of the Opinion, that the Apostle is here personating and giving the Character of an <HI>unconverted</HI> or un|regenerate
<PB N="169" REF="005572_0176_0000000000000000">
Person, struggling under the Convictions of an awakened Conscience. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is undeniably certain, that the most <HI>holy</HI> of all the natural Descendants of <HI>Adam,</HI> that ever were in the World, have had Cause to make the same Complaints of their <HI>remaining Corruptions,</HI> as the Apostle here does; and have all in like Manner experienced what the Apostle elsewhere calls <HI>the Flesh lusting against the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>the Spirit against the Flesh.</HI> Gal. v.
17.&mdash;Have they not all of them some remaining <HI>Carnality?</HI> The most improv'd Saints, comparatively but <HI>Babes in Christ,</HI> and not so <HI>spiri|tual</HI> as they should be? Nay, are they not even <HI>sold under Sin?</HI> It is true, that they do not volun|tarily with <HI>Ahab, sell themselves to do wickedly;</HI> this would denote the full Dominion and Power of Sin: but they are <HI>sold,</HI> as <HI>Captives</HI> are sold, against their Wills. Though for the general they make ever so great Resistance, they have yet Corruptions that do and will at Times prevail against them, and <HI>bring them into Captivity.</HI> &mdash;Have they not all Cause to ac|knowledge, that they <HI>do what they allow not, what they would not,</HI> and even <HI>what they hate?</HI> That they fall short of <HI>what they would do?</HI> And that <HI>when they would do Good, Evil is present with them?</HI> That they <HI>find a Law in their Members, warring against the Law of their Mind?</HI> And don't they groan, being bur|thened, under a Sense of what <HI>wretched Men</HI> they are on these Accounts? In other Words, Are there any of them that don't feel in themselves sinful Affections, sinful Imperfections, and sinful Actions, that are the Grief and Burthen of their Souls? Here let the Appeal be made to all <HI>the Generation of God's Children,</HI> whether they do not find these Things in themselves, even in their most
<PB N="170" REF="005572_0177_0000000000000000">
watchful Periods.&mdash;I must needs say, it argues a dreadful Ignorance of, or an unaccountable Inat|tention to, the <HI>Plague of their own Heart,</HI> in them who have not a feeling and experimental Appre|hension of these Things.&mdash;It may therefore be justly presumed, that the Apostle here complains of what every true Christian feels and laments.&mdash;Or at least I may confidently say, that the Experi|ence of all the Children of God is a Refutation of the principal Arguments against my Interpretation of this Chapter.</P>
<P>It may be added, in the Language of Another, "Those Objections are chiefly owing to a mista|ken Notion of the <HI>Case</HI> described here, from Ver. 14<HI>th;</HI> as if the Apostle spake of <HI>gross sinning in Practice,</HI> with only some feeble Reluctance of his <HI>Will,</HI> and habitually transgressing, in a Course of <HI>outward Actions,</HI> thro' the power of some <HI>conquering</HI> and <HI>ruling Lust,</HI> against the Dictates of his <HI>natural Conscience.</HI>&mdash;Whereas, in Truth, he does not own a customary Indulgence to any the <HI>least Sin</HI> in external Prac|tice; much less to any great Wickedness, and gross Sins of <HI>Presumption.</HI> But he evidently speaks in his Complaint, of <HI>unallowed Frailties,</HI> or Sins of <HI>Infirmity,</HI> incident to the best of Men.&mdash;And if his Language in representing the Case seems too ex|pressive and emphatical, we may fairly resolve this into his <HI>Humility;</HI> a Grace, that always makes the Christian willing to see the <HI>worst</HI> of his Case, and to lay himself <HI>low</HI> before God and Man. From this Principle, we must conceive it was, that this same Apostle elsewhere describes himself under those debasing Characters, <HI>The least of the Apostles, &mdash;Less than the least of all Saints,</HI> &mdash;yea, <HI>The Chief of Sinners.</HI>&mdash;Though an eminent Example of Ho|liness,
<PB N="171" REF="005572_0178_0000000000000000">
yet being not <HI>already perfect,</HI> he readily con|fesses it: And under a humbling, affecting Sense of his Imperfections and remaining Corruptions, he breathes out his Complaints in very animated and striking Forms of Speech. However, his self-abasing Expressions (taken in this View) do all of them well consist with the brighter and com|mendatory Representations he sometimes makes of himself, when considering his Case in another Light: and they are all reconcilable with every Scripture-Character of regenerate Professors, as well as with the universal Experience of real Chri|stians, even the best upon Earth. For don't they all own themselves conscious of <HI>indwelling Sin,</HI> and <HI>fleshly Lusts that war against the Soul?</HI> Don't they all confess themselves <HI>not</HI> as yet perfectly <HI>spiritual?</HI> their Hearts <HI>not</HI> as yet perfectly <HI>enlarged</HI> to run the Way of God's Commandments; their Graces <HI>not</HI> as yet perfectly <HI>free</HI> in their Exercise, but often un|der a very sensible Restraint, so that they cannot produce them into Act, as they would and ought; their <HI>Corruptions</HI> insinuating and intermingling with their best Performances of Duty; their <HI>Lusts,</HI> though by Divine Grace conquer'd within them, yet <HI>striving</HI> still <HI>for the Mastery,</HI> yea, sometimes usurping the Throne seemingly, and acting the Ty|rant over them for a Season, against the fixed Judg|ment and settled Bent of their <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Heart,</HI> which in the Account of Gospel-Grace is the <HI>Man?</HI>&mdash;Now, looking upon themselves, if try'd by the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> as liable to be <HI>condemn'd with the World,</HI> they have therefore no Hope of being <HI>sa|ved by any Works of Righteousness, which they have done,</HI> but only look for Mercy, <HI>the Mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> to be magnify'd in their <HI>Delive|rance</HI>

out of the present State of Imperfection. In the mean Time their Sins, yea, their unavoidable Infirmities, are their Burden, under which they sigh and bemoan themselves; asham'd and griev'd e|ven for <HI>disallowed Frailties,</HI> more than unregenerate Sinners for their wilful and scandalous Enormities.&mdash;Is it any <HI>uncommon Case,</HI> for a <HI>Child of God,</HI> in a repenting Frame, passionately to lament in the Strain of <HI>Rom.</HI> vii&mdash;judging himself for <HI>Carnality,</HI> complaining of spiritual <HI>Captivity,</HI> and crying out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am!

Or what one Word is there in all his Description of the <HI>Case</HI> before him, but is fairly accommodable to this Interpretation?&mdash;And what Occasion then to suppose the Apostle uses such a <HI>Metaschematism</HI> here, as some suppose; transferring to <HI>Himself</HI> those odious Things which belong'd only to <HI>an unregenerate Legalist,</HI> and putting them in his own Case, meerly out of Modesty, and to avoid giving Offence to the Party reprov'd?"</P>
<P N="2">2. We find the Apostle here giving <HI>Characters</HI> of himself that are the distinguishing Marks of a <HI>re|generate</HI> State; Characters, that do not, that can|not, agree to any <HI>unconverted</HI> Person in the World.&mdash;It is, for Instance, the peculiar Property of a Child of God, to <HI>hate</HI> that which is <HI>evil;</HI> and to have a <HI>Will present</HI> with him to that which is <HI>good.</HI>&mdash;No unregenerate Person is able truly to say, that <HI>he would do that which is good;</HI> and <HI>would not do that which is evil.</HI>&mdash;The Conscience indeed, and the Judgment of an unregenerate Man, may in some
<PB N="173" REF="005572_0180_0000000000000000">
Sense be said to be against the Sin: but his <HI>Will</HI> is for it, and the Lusts of a depraved Will habitu|ally govern the Man; so that he always <HI>inclines</HI> to Sin, in one kind or another, in one Degree or ano|ther, and does always actually <HI>indulge</HI> himself in Sin, except only when under some special Restraints by Shame or Fear of Punishment. He can never be said to <HI>hate</HI> Sin; though he hate the Misery that is like to be the Consequence of it: but he rather hates the <HI>Law,</HI> that punishes Sin.&mdash;And to be sure, it cannot be said of any unregenerate Man, that <HI>he hates Evil</HI> and <HI>would do Good,</HI> indefinitely: that is, that he hates all Evil, and would do all Good, without any Distinction or Reserve; as the Apostle here affirms of himself.&mdash;No! there is some <HI>Delilah</HI> in Reserve, some Bosom-Lust re|tain'd, some Methods of vital Piety (either of Heart or Life) rejected, by the greatest Proficients in Morality among the unconverted World. None but the truly regenerate can say with <HI>David, I es|teem all thy Precepts concerning all Things, to be right; and I hate every false Way.</HI> Psal. cxix. 128.</P>
<P>To this I may add, that it is the distinguishing Character of a Child of God, to <HI>delight in the Law of the Lord, after the inward Man.</HI>&mdash;An unregene|rate Man may by the Lashes of an awaken'd Con|science, and Terrors of the Law, be kept under some slavish Restraints, and be forced to some ser|vile Endeavours of Obedience: But could he with a quiet Conscience, and Hopes of Salvation, enjoy his Choice, he would break through all these Re|straints, and always gratify his sinful and sensual Inclinations.&mdash;To have our <HI>inward Man,</HI> our very Mind and Heart <HI>delighted in the Law of God,</HI> is to have <HI>our Souls</HI> delighted in a Conformity to God;
<PB N="174" REF="005572_0181_0000000000000000">
the <HI>Law</HI> being but a Transcript of his moral Per|fections. That is, in other Words, it is to love GOD himself, to delight our selves in his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> to love to be like him in <HI>the inward Man,</HI> having <HI>the Law written on the Tables of our Heart,</HI> which is the Sum of all Religion, the whole and only Evidence of vital Christianity, all other Marks and Characters of a Christian indeed being contain'd in it.&mdash;Whence it is, that the <HI>Psalmist</HI> so often mentions <HI>his Delight in God's Commandments, which he had loved,</HI> as a Mark of his Uprightness. No unregenerate Professor does really <HI>delight</HI> in God, as the holy and righteous Governor and Judge of the World: And therefore no unregenerate Per|son can truly say, as the Apostle here, <HI>I delight in the Law of God, after the inward Man.</HI></P>
<P>I may likewise add, that it is the distinguishing Character of a Child of God, to <HI>groan</HI> under the Burden of <HI>the Body of Death,</HI> to long for <HI>Deliverance</HI> from it, and to have a <HI>War</HI> maintain'd between the <HI>Law of his Members,</HI> and the <HI>Law of his Mind.</HI>&mdash;Awaken'd Sinners may groan under a Sense of Guilt and Danger; and have a War between their Consciences and their Lusts. But they are Belie|vers, and none but they, who groan under the Bur|den of their Heart-Corruptions; and after a fur|ther Progress in Holiness.&mdash;Unrenewed Sinners may have a <HI>Law in their Members,</HI> warring against their awakned Consciences: but they have no con|trary <HI>Law in their Minds,</HI> no such habitual Bent of Soul, or stated and settled Disposition of their Af|fections, as has the Force of a <HI>Law</HI> with them, and maintains a constant <HI>War</HI> with their inward Corruptions, their vain Imaginations, sinful Appe|tites and Passions.&mdash;They do indeed <HI>love the Lord,</HI>

that thus <HI>hate evil.</HI> Psal. xcvii. 10. And they who thus <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith,</HI> will <HI>lay hold on eternal Life.</HI> I Tim. vi. 12. It's one Characteris|tick of a true Believer, that he <HI>resists Sin,</HI> in all the <HI>Lusts</HI> thereof, even the most secret, and hidden from the Eye of the World.&mdash;Every Creature has its Antipathies: the <HI>new Creature,</HI> as well as any other; and as <HI>Sin</HI> is the greatest Contrariety to its Temper and Taste, to its Interests and Comforts, the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> always is disposed to exert it self in an Opposition to <HI>indwelling Sin,</HI> studying to mortify it more and more.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Apostle is here giving the Character of a Person who has a <HI>twofold Principle</HI> in him: The one a governing Principle, that may be called <HI>himself:</HI> the other a subdued Principle, which is <HI>not he, but Sin that dwelleth in him.</HI>&mdash;Now can any <HI>unconverted</HI> Person in the World truly say, it is not <HI>he,</HI> that transgresseth the Law, when the natural Bent and Disposition of his Soul is to <HI>Evil, only to Evil, and that continually,</HI> notwithstanding all the Restraints of the Law and Checks of Conscience; and when all the Sins of his Heart and Life are imputed to him, and will be punished upon him, if he remain in his present State?&mdash;Can any <HI>unconverted</HI> Person in the World say, that <HI>he himself</HI> (all in him which in God's Account can be called himself) <HI>serves the Law of God,</HI> though <HI>with his Flesh</HI> (his remaining carnal Affections and Appetites) the <HI>Law of Sin;</HI> when it is certain, that every unconverted Man is, both with his <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Flesh,</HI> a <HI>Servant to Sin,</HI> and <HI>free from Righteousness,</HI> as the Apostle assures us, in the sixth Chapter of this Epistle, Verses 16, 17, 20.</P>
<P N="4">4. What justifies my Interpretation beyond all reasonable Opposition, is, that the Apostle draws
<PB N="176" REF="005572_0183_0000000000000000">
that <HI>Conclusion</HI> from those very Characters here gi|ven of himself, <HI>There is therefore now no Condemna|tion to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit: For the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> Chap. viii. 1, 2.&mdash;Two Things do here appear to me certain and un|questionable. One is, that the first Verse of this viiith Chapter is here represented (as plainly as any Thing can be represented by Words) as a neces|sary Consequence or just Inference from the <HI>Premises,</HI> and from the <HI>Characters</HI> the Apostle had there given of himself; and is therefore a full Proof, that every one in the same spiritual State described in the latter Part of the preceding Chap|ter, is <HI>in Christ Jesus,</HI> and freed from <HI>Condemnation.&mdash;There is THEREFORE now no Condemnation,</HI> &amp;c. Wherefore? Because they who are in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> are <HI>freed from Sin,</HI> and do <HI>not walk after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</HI> as before described: and particu|larly because <HI>they themselves do serve the Law of God,</HI> as expressed in the Verse immediately foregoing. This Construction is necessary, to make the Connection of this Verse with what went before, congruous and rational. Nay, it is the Construction which the Apostle himself purposely leads us to, in the 2d Verse. <HI>FOR the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> As if he had said, They who are <HI>in Christ Jesus</HI> cannot be under <HI>Condemnation,</HI> since they are made <HI>free from the Law</HI> (from the Dominion, tho' not from the Remains) <HI>of Sin and Death;</HI> which I have already shewn you to be <HI>my</HI> Case, in the foregoing Description of my spiritual State and Experience, and in the Characters I have given of
<PB N="177" REF="005572_0184_0000000000000000">
<HI>my self.</HI>&mdash;Another Thing that appears to me most certain and evident is, that the Apostle speaks of himself here (in this 2d Verse of Chapter viii) in the <HI>same Manner,</HI> and to the <HI>same Purpose,</HI> as he spoke of himself in the latter Part of the forego|ing Chapter: And that these Words, with the fol|lowing Verses, are the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Conclusion</HI> of that whole Discourse. This was the Point the Apostle was undertaking to explain; this the Subject of the preceeding Chapter, as I have already shewn; in this he speaks in the <HI>first</HI> Person, as in the for|mer Chapter; this is a natural and rational summing up or drawing the Conclusion of the whole, <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus, hath made ME free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI>&mdash;Whence it follows, that those <HI>Characters</HI> in the latter Part of the <HI>seventh</HI> Chapter, belong to none but such who are <HI>in Christ Jesus;</HI> and by him freed from <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and from the <HI>Law of Sin and Death.</HI></P>
<P>And now, I leave it to you (Sir) to judge, whe|ther we have not Reason to conclude, that the A|postle is here speaking of himself when in a <HI>re|newed</HI> or <HI>regenerate</HI> State; and thereby represent|ing the Conflict, which the <HI>Children of God</HI> in their highest Attainments have with their remaining Corruptions: Since there is so plain a Transition (by the Change of the Tense) from considering what he <HI>once</HI> had been, to a Representation of what he <HI>now</HI> was, at the Time of writing this Epistle.&mdash;Have we not Reason to conclude this, when <HI>all</HI> (the very best) of the Children of God, do always experience the <HI>same Struggle</HI> with their Corrupti|ons, as is here described?&mdash;May we not confident|ly draw this Conclusion, when we find, that the <HI>Characters</HI> here given are applicable to none but the
<PB N="178" REF="005572_0185_0000000000000000">
regenerate only? None but they <HI>hate that which is evil;</HI> and have <HI>a Will present with them to that which is good.</HI> To be sure none but they hate all evil; and have a Will to all good, without Re|serve or Distinction. None but they <HI>delight in the Law of the Lord, after the inward Man.</HI> None but they groan under the Burthen of <HI>the Body of Death;</HI> and maintain a constant <HI>War with the Law of Sin in their Members.</HI>&mdash;May we not safely maintain this Conclusion against all Opposition, when we find a Person described under the Influence of a two sold Principle, <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Grace?</HI> The <HI>former</HI> so brought into Subjection, that its Actings are not to be attributed, strictly speaking, to HIM (being so contrary to the <HI>new Man,</HI> his predominant Princi|ple, according to which God accounts of us, and denominates us) but are imputable only to the Re|mains of the <HI>old Man,</HI> or <HI>indwelling Sin.</HI> The <HI>lat|ter</HI> having such an Empire in his Soul, as to be called <HI>himself,</HI> so that (notwithstanding his Corrup|tions and the Out-breakings of them) he can say, <HI>I my self serve the Law of God.</HI>&mdash;In Fine, this Conclusion most certainly appears to be necessary and unquestionable, that they must be in a regene|rate State, who are delivered from <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and who <HI>walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit;</HI> and who are by <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Jesus, made free from the Law of Sin and Death;</HI> as the Apostle shews to be his own Case, according to the Description he had before given of himself. To suppose that he here personates a Professor unregenerate, must upon the whole ap|pear utterly inconsistent with the Case described in these Passages: and therefore such an Exposition, as altogether forced, is not to be received.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="005572_0186_0000000000000000">But after all you'll perhaps object, that my In|terpretation tends to make Men <HI>secure</HI> and <HI>careless, bold</HI> and <HI>presumptuous,</HI> in a State and Course of <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, It is so far from this, that it has a di|rect <HI>contrary</HI> Tendency. It is a solemn Admoniti|on to the Children of God, to be upon their Guard, since they have such a domestick Enemy to deal with: And a like Admonition it is to all careless secure habitual Sinners, not to flatter themselves with a vain presumptuous Hope of their regenerate State, on any Pretences whatsoever.</P>
<P>It is here the Character of a Christian indeed, that he <HI>hates Evil,</HI> all Evil, without Reserve. IF therefore they who retain any Favourite-Lust, and roll it as a sweet Morsel under their Tongue, cry <HI>Peace</HI> to their Souls, they are <HI>sleeping upon the Top of a Mast: There is no Peace, faith my God, to the Wicked.</HI> The Peace of such is all a Delusion; a most false, absurd and dangerous Peace.</P>
<P>It is here likewise the Character of a true Chri|stian, that he does <HI>not allow</HI> so much as his <HI>Imper|fections;</HI> that when these obtain, they are without his Consent, and against his Will. These are <HI>what he would not,</HI> and among the <HI>Evils,</HI> which <HI>he hates.</HI> They therefore are entertaining but a vain Dream of a safe State, who are knowingly and deliberate|ly living in any Way of Sinning, and who custo|marily <HI>allow</HI> any moral Imperfection. They will certainly in the Conclusion be rejected, among the <HI>Workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>It is here also represented as the Property of every sincere Christian, that he has a <HI>Will present</HI> with him to <HI>that which is good;</HI> that <HI>he consents to the Law that it is good;</HI> and that <HI>he delights in the Law of God after the inward Man;</HI> that is, in other
<PB N="180" REF="005572_0187_0000000000000000">
Words (as I have shewn) he truly loves God and Godliness.&mdash;Here is therefore no Foundation for them to think well of their State, whose whole Re|ligion is constrain'd by Fear; and whose Hearts and Affections are not sincerely engaged in the Service of God. As for them who love the World and their Idols, more than God and a Life of sincere universal Obedience to Him, such are in the <HI>Bonds of Iniquity,</HI> and have <HI>no Part or Lot in this Matter.</HI></P>
<P>It is moreover given as the Mark of a true Chri|stian, that he <HI>groans after Deliverance from the Body of Death;</HI> not only from Guilt and Danger, but from the Remainders of his Corruption; and main|tains a constant <HI>War</HI> against the <HI>Law of Sin in his Members.</HI> What Encouragement is there therefore for such an one to hope well of his State, that don't make it his Business to <HI>keep his Heart,</HI> and to watch over his Lips and Life; that don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrestle with God for Deliverance from, and greater Victory o|ver his Corruptions; and that don't look upon his remaining Imperfections, as the great Burden of his Life?</P>
<P>It is furthermore given in Character of the true Christian, that he thankfully expects this Delive|rance only by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> The Apostle's Ans|wer to the Question, <HI>Who shall deliver me? is, I thank God thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> q. d. I thank|fully look unto God, in and through Jesus Christ, as a sure Refuge in this Difficulty; and as the Foun|tain of Life, from whence I may safely expect my needed Supplies.&mdash;All Unbelievers therefore, as excluded from any justifiable Pretence to this Character, have no Room left them to think well of their State.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="005572_0188_0000000000000000">In fine, the Christian here described, is one who <HI>with his Mind does himself serve the Law of God.</HI>&mdash;He has had <HI>God's Law put into his Mind,</HI> and he <HI>serves God with his Spirit.</HI> His whole Man, all that can be called <HI>himself,</HI> is engaged in a Life of Go|spel-Obedience.&mdash;What can they therefore have to do with the Peace and Comfort, which is here offered to Christians indeed, who are grossly defec|tive, partial, and unsteady in their Obedience; whose <HI>Minds</HI> are <HI>wavering,</HI> and whose <HI>Hearts</HI> are <HI>divided</HI> between the Service of God and their Idols? <HI>A double-minded Man is unstable in all his Ways: and let not that Man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</HI> Jam. i. 7, 8.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. Wherein the Mo|ravian and Antinomian Doctrine of Justification, in some of its peculiar Points, is considered and refuted.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is true, that I do agree with the <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Moravians</HI> in this, that <Q><HI>The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ is the alone Matter of our Justification before God.</HI></Q> But I am not|withstanding very far from agreeing with them, in the whole of their Doctrine on that important Article of a Sinner's Justification by Faith in Christ.&mdash;The Person you have conversed with, has im|posed upon you, in pretending, that <Q><HI>they and we are of the same Sentiments, with Respect to the Doctrine of Justification.</HI></Q>&mdash;In Compliance with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our Demands, I shall therefore endeavour to shew you <Q><HI>What is the</HI> Difference <HI>between them and those of our Profession, in this great Point; and what are the</HI> Reasons <HI>of our differing from them.</HI></Q>&mdash;I presume, you don't expect from me a particular Detection of all the <HI>Moravian</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> Er|rors: this would require a larger Volume, than I have Leisure to write, or you would have Patience to read. I shall therefore limit myself to the Sub|ject, which you have proposed.</P>
<P>There are these two Things especially in the Doctrine of our Justification by Faith, which are to be condemned, as most dangerous Errors in the
<PB N="183" REF="005572_0190_0000000000000000">
Sects you speak of. The first is, their Notion of the <HI>Nature of a saving Faith.</HI> The second is, the <HI>Part</HI> which they assign to Faith in our <HI>Justification.</HI> It is necessary in Order to set the Affair in a proper Light, that I be something particular upon each of these.</P>
<P>The first Thing then to be considered, is their Notion of the <HI>Nature</HI> of a saving <HI>Faith.</HI> This they suppose to consist in a joyful Perswasion of our Interest in Christ, and of our Title to his purchas|ed Salvation. And accordingly Count <HI>Zinzendorf</HI> frequently gives us this View of a saving Faith. <HI>Believe then</HI> (says he) <HI>that Jesus has aton'd and pay'd a Ransom for you all; and that you may experience it this very Moment; and know, that ye have been healed by his Wounds and by his Stripes.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Discourses on the</HI> Redemption of Man. p. 120.</NOTE>&mdash;And the <HI>Antinomians</HI> in general agree with him in this, that saving Faith consists in a comfortable Persuasion of our personal Interest in the Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;But then on the contrary, you may perceive by what I have written to you on this Subject, that I don't suppose this Perswasion to enter into the Definition of a saving Faith; nor to be any Part of it. It is what a true Believer may want; and an unbelieving and impenitent Sinner may entertain, in an high Degree.</P>
<P>This is an Affair of vast Consequence, and there|fore deserves a more distinct and particular Consi|deration, than I can now have Opportunity for. I shall however attempt to set it in as plain and fa|miliar a Light as I can. In Order to this, it will be proper (previous to my Reasoning against this wild Opinion) to premise these Observations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="184" REF="005572_0191_0000000000000000">1. That <HI>Believers</HI> may have good Satisfaction of their safe Estate, and full <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their In|terest in Christ, from their Experience of a <HI>Work of Grace</HI> in their Hearts; and from the <HI>Fruits</HI> of Faith, in their Affections and Conversations. It is just Reasoning, from the Nature of the Fruit, to the Quality of the Tree that bears it. If there|fore a Man finds in himself an habitual, predomi|nant Desire after the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Por|tion of his Soul, and the Foundation of his Hope; if he feels his Sins to be the Burthen of his Soul, what he hates without Reserve, what he strives, watches and prays against, and never willingly and deliberately indulges; if he delights himself in the Lord, in near Approaches to him, and Communion with him in his Ordinances; if he knows it to be the Bent and Disposition of his Soul, to approve himself to God in a Life of Spiritual-Mindedness, and in all holy Conversation and Godliness, in Self|denial, in Piety towards God, in Righteousness, and Charity towards Men: Though he may yet groan under many disallowed Imperfections, he never|theless may be, and ought to be <HI>perswaded</HI> of his Interest in Christ; and give the Praise and Glory of these divine Influences upon his Soul, to the blessed Author of them. This is the ordinary and standing Evidence to the Children of God, of the Safety of their State.&mdash;By this they have a com|fortable and joyful Perswasion, that he who has <HI>begun a good Work</HI> in them, will <HI>perform it to the Day of Christ.</HI>&mdash;By this <HI>the Children of God are ma|nifest,</HI> both to themselves and others. In this Sense then, I don't deny to Believers a <HI>Perswasion,</HI> or Manifestation of their own good Estate. This <HI>Per|swasion</HI> is what they should by no Means content|edly
<PB N="185" REF="005572_0192_0000000000000000">
rest short of. It is greatly needful, not only to their Comfort and Hope, but to their serving God with the Dispositions becoming Children, with Enlargement of Soul, and with Chearfulness and Delight.&mdash;But then you must remember, that this <HI>Perswasion</HI> is not <HI>Faith:</HI> but arises from the Fruits and Effects of Faith upon the Soul, and is what may (sometimes at least) be wanting in the best of the Children of God.&mdash;I must still further observe,</P>
<P N="2">2. That God is sometimes pleased, in a more <HI>special</HI> and peculiar Manner, to <HI>shed abroad his Love</HI> in the Hearts of Believers, by his Holy Spirit, with such superior <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Evidence,</HI> that their gracious Sincerity, so consequently their Interest in Christ, and their Title to the eternal Inheritance, can at such Times be <HI>no Ways doubtful</HI> and questi|onable to them.&mdash;<HI>The Spirit of God witnesseth with their Spirits, that they are his Children.</HI> And they <HI>are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise.</HI>&mdash;In this Case, as in the other before mentioned, their comforta|ble <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their Interest in Christ arises from an evident Discovery of the Exercise of the <HI>Graces</HI> of his blessed Spirit. Herein this joyful <HI>Perswasion</HI> in both Cases agrees, that it's reasonable and well|grounded. The Spirit of God never perswades the Soul to believe a Truth without its proper E|vidence; nor causes the Believer to rejoice with|out rational Grounds and Motives.&mdash;But then this latter <HI>Perswasion</HI> differs from that beforemention'd, in these following Respects.&mdash;It is produced in the Soul with an incomparably <HI>stronger</HI> and <HI>clearer Light.</HI>&mdash;In the other Case, Satisfaction is obtain'd by a Series of Reasoning, Reflection, and Self-Exami|nation; distinctly considering the Scripture-Rule, and comparing it with the State, Circumstances,

and settled Habit of the Soul. Whereas, in this Case, the Soul has so clear a View and Conscious|ness of its present Exercise of Faith in Christ, and Love to God, that all Clouds are dispersed, all Mists and Darkness vanish; and there is no Room left for Doubts and misgiving Thoughts: But the Soul sees it self safe in the Hands of Christ; and can rest there with the greatest Alacrity and Plea|sure.&mdash;Moreover, as this <HI>Perswasion,</HI> which I am now speaking of, makes its Way into the Soul with much greater Light, so it has a much <HI>quicker</HI> and more <HI>sudden Production.</HI> The Soul is not exercised in this Case, for Months or Years together, with difficult Inquiries into its own State but at once, before its aware, overcomes all its Fears, by feel|ing the Possession and Influence of the Graces and Consolations of the Spirit of God.&mdash;I may yet add, that this <HI>Perswasion</HI> is accompanied with such un|speakable <HI>Joy,</HI> as those (even Believers themselves) cannot have any Idea of, who have not thus <HI>tasted that the Lord is gracious.</HI> The divine Light shines into the Soul with a transporting and ravishing En|ergy, till it is as it were lost in a joyful Astonish|ment. By this the World vanishes out of Sight, and Death it self loses its Terrors; by this the Martyrs have been enabled to sing in the Flames, and most joyfully to triumph over all that is most frightful and distressing to Nature.&mdash;To which I may also add, that this joyful <HI>Perswasion,</HI> of which I now speak, has a <HI>transforming</HI> Efficacy on the Soul, who is the happy Subject of it. It puri|fies the Heart, and promotes Conformity to God: It humbles the Soul to Nothing in its own Eyes; bows it to an absolute Subjection to the Will of God: and excites in it the most vigorous Exercise

<P>This appears evidently true, in that Nothing can be the Matter of our Justification before God, but what is a proper and adequate Atonement and Pro|pitiation for our Sins.&mdash;That <HI>we have all sinned, and come short of the Glory of God,</HI> is a Truth evident,

Infinite Justice and Holiness cannot look upon those to be just, who are under the Guilt of Sin, and the damning Sen|tence of the Law.&mdash;There is therefore a Necessi|ty, that the Dishonour done to God by our Sins be repaired, and the penal Demands of his broken Law be fulfilled; that our Guilt may be removed from us, and God be <HI>just,</HI> in <HI>justifying the Ungodly.</HI> How else would <HI>the Judge of all the Earth do right,</HI> in declaring the Sinner righteous, while he remains under the Pollution and Guilt, both of original and actual Sin?&mdash;As far then as our <HI>Obedience,</HI> consi|der'd in it self, can answer those Ends, so far it may conduce to our Justification before God; and no farther&mdash;If we can answer the Demands of the Justice and Law of God for our past Sins; if we can pay ten Thousand Talents with less than No|thing; and if by committing new Sin (as we al|ways do in the best of our imperfect Obedience) we can satisfy for our former Sin and Guilt, and so discharge the old Score; then may our Obedience be consider'd as the Condition of our Justification before God.&mdash;Whereas, if neither our legal nor our evangelical Obedience can do any Thing at all towards this; but (as coming from a sinful Na|ture, and mixed with sinful Imperfection) will add to the Debt, and increase the Weight of our Guilt, then it's certain, that that cannot be the Matter of a Sinner's Justification, nor the Condition of our Acceptance with God.&mdash;Whence we may conclude with the Apostle, that <HI>Christ Jesus is set forth to be a Propitiation, thro' Faith in his Blood,</HI> that <HI>his Righ|teousness may be declared, for the Remission of our

Sins,</HI> in Order that <HI>God may be just, and the Justi|fier of him which believeth in Jesus.</HI> Rom. iii. 25, 26.</P>
<P>Here can therefore be no Room at all for that Pretence, That the Obedience of Christ has pur|chased forus a dispensing Act of Grace, that our sincere Obedience shall on his Account be accepted instead of the perfect Obedience demanded by the Law of Nature: And that we are accordingly jus|tified by our evangelical Obedience, our Faith and Repentance, and our sincere Endeavours after a Conformity to the Will of God. For by what|ever Price these Terms of our Justification be pro|cured for us, that <HI>Obedience,</HI> immediately by which (according to that Notion) we are justified, is <HI>our own Righteousness:</HI> and therefore cannot intitle us to any <HI>Justification</HI> before God, mentioned in Scrip|ture. Not to that respected by the <HI>Law:</HI> For that is only proposed on Condition of <HI>perfect</HI> Obedience. Not to that respected by the <HI>Gospel:</HI> For that is the <HI>Justification of the Ungodly,</HI> by <HI>a not imputing their Iniquity,</HI> but <HI>imputing to them Righteousness, without Works.</HI> (Rom. iv.) Whereas, according to this Imagination, it must be by a Vindication of our own Sincerity; and in Virtue of our own evangelical Righteousness, which must there|fore be proportion'd to the Demands of Justice, or leave us open to the Curses of the Law.&mdash;How much safer therefore would it be (with the Apostle) to disclaim all <HI>our own Righteousness,</HI> that we may be vested with that <HI>Righteousness which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith!</HI> Phil. iii. 9.</P>
<P>Besides, how can our sincere Obedience justify us, when we can have no gracious <HI>Sincerity,</HI> and therefore no true <HI>Obedience,</HI> until the Moment in
<PB N="190" REF="005572_0197_0000000000000000">
which we are actually <HI>justified?</HI>&mdash;I think, all must allow, that he who is united to Christ by Faith, is at the same time justified in the Sight of God. For we are <HI>accepted in the Beloved:&mdash;There is no Con|demnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.</HI>&mdash;And it is most certain, that we can have no graci|ous Sincerity, before we are united to Christ by Faith unfeigned. <HI>As the Branch cannot hear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much Fruit: For without me ye can do nothing.</HI> Joh. xiv. 4, 5.&mdash;From whence it is evi|dent, that no Man can exercise gracious Sincerity in performing any good Works, until he be in a justified State: and consequently sincere Obedi|ence, either to the Law or Gospel, cannot be the Condition of our Justification before God.&mdash;The first Exercise of saving Faith unites us to Christ; and is the immediate Foundation both of our Justi|fication and of our sincere Obedience.&mdash;There is not a Moment of Time passes between the first Act of true Faith, and our Justification: and conse|quently not a Moment of Time for the Practice of sincere Obedience, before we are united to Christ, and thereby justified in the Sight of God. Now it is impossible, that our sincere Obedience should be both the Condition and the Consequence of our Justification.</P>
<P>I might add to this, that if the <HI>Scriptures</HI> ascribe all the spiritual <HI>Benefits</HI> we are partakers of, either in this World or that to come, to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST <HI>only,</HI> then our <HI>Obedience,</HI> either to the Law or Gospel, can have no Hand in our <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> before God.

<PB N="191" REF="005572_0198_0000000000000000">
from any other. And it appears plainly the whole Design and Tenour of the Gospel, to illustrate this blessed Truth to us. Though I can't now enlarge upon this Head, I will just mention a few Instances to exemplify it.&mdash;It is from Christ's Righteousness alone, that we receive the compleat Forgiveness of our Sins. <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 6, 7, 8. <HI>Even as</HI> David <HI>also describeth the Blessedness of the Man, unto whom God imputeth Righteousness</HI> WITHOUT WORKS, <HI>saying, Blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven, whose Sins are covered. Blessed is the Man, to whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</HI>&mdash;By this alone we are made righteous. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 19. <HI>By the Obedience of One, shall many be made righteous.</HI>&mdash;By this alone we are acquitted from Guilt, and freed from Con|demnation. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 1. <HI>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI>&mdash;By this we are reconciled to God. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 18. <HI>For all Things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him|self by Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;By this we have Peace with God, Access into his gracious Presence, and joyful Hopes of eternal Glory. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 1, 2. <HI>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom also we have Access into this Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God.</HI>&mdash;By this we are Heirs of eter|nal Life. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 21. <HI>That as Sin hath reigned unto Death, even so might Grace reign thro' Righteousness, unto eternal Life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>blessed Hope</HI> we are looking for, is therefore called <HI>the Hope of Righteousness.</HI> Gal. v. 5.</P>
<P>I will only add, that if the Scriptures do expresly exclude all our own Righteousness, and all our own Works, from any Hand in our Justification, we also should renounce them all; and depend
<PB N="192" REF="005572_0199_0000000000000000">
upon the Righteousness of Christ only. For this see <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us.</HI> Rom. iv. 5. <HI>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness.</HI> These Things are so plainly and evidently the Scope and Design of the whole New Testament, that all the artful Evasions of those, who would <HI>go about to establish their own Righteousness,</HI> and rob Christ of the Honour of their Justification and Salvation, should be rejected with Abhorrence.&mdash;In fine, Let me intreat you, Sir, always to remember, that <HI>both the Law and the Prophets witness the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe.</HI> Rom. iii. 21, 22.&mdash;That <HI>Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that believeth.</HI> Rom. x. 4.&mdash;And that <HI>being justified by his Blood, we shall be saved from Wrath thro' him.</HI> Rom. v. 9.</P>
<P>You'll pardon me, that I have so long delayed your Expectations.&mdash;I thought it necessary, not only to clear the Way before me, that you may see in what Sense I oppose the <HI>Antinomian</HI> Dreams and <HI>Moravian</HI> Dotages: but also to offer some Pre|cautions, that you may not fall upon <HI>Scylla,</HI> while you avoid <HI>Charybdis;</HI> but steer your Way safe be|tween the two Extreams.</P>
<P>By all that I have now said you may perceive, that the Question between us and the <HI>Moravians</HI> or <HI>Antinomians</HI> is not, &mdash;Whether Believers may have, and should seek to have, a comfortable <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their Interest in Christ? To doubt of this, would be at once to contradict the strongest Attes|tations thereto in the Word of God, and the hap|py Experience of his Children.&mdash;Nor is it the
<PB N="193" REF="005572_0200_0000000000000000">
Question, Whether we are <HI>justified</HI> by any At|tainments of our own? To suppose this, were to counteract the whole Design of the Gospel; and to bring greatest Contempt upon the Redee|mer's Merits and Righteousness.&mdash;But the Ques|tion is, Whether a true saving <HI>Faith</HI> consists in a <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our personal actual <HI>Interest in Christ,</HI> and that he will bestow his eternal Salvation upon <HI>us in particular?</HI> Whether there may not be a strong <HI>Perswasion</HI> of a justified State, <HI>without</HI> any true saving <HI>Faith;</HI> and a true saving <HI>Faith,</HI> with|out this particular <HI>Perswasion</HI> of a justified State?&mdash;If this be so, if Men may have this <HI>Perswasion</HI> while in a State of Guilt and Condemnation, and if God's own dear Children may be in Doubts and Darkness, with Respect to their State, it necessa|rily follows, that this <HI>Moravian</HI> and <HI>Antinomian</HI> Doctrine is a most dangerous Mistake and Delusion. This Matter therefore deserves to be particularly consider'd.</P>
<P>That Men may be strongly <HI>perswaded</HI> of the <HI>Safety</HI> of their State, while remaining under <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>Condemnation,</HI> appears from such Considerations as these.</P>
<P>If this <HI>Perswasion</HI> may be entertain'd by those who have never been emptied of their <HI>Self-Suffi|ciency,</HI> nor ever had any sensible Discovery of their <HI>lost, impotent,</HI> and <HI>helpless</HI> State, it certainly cannot be a true saving Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;That this <HI>may be,</HI> is evident from the Nature of Things. There can be no Reason assigned, why such mayn't be capable to entertain a strong Opi|nion of their own good State, who have never dis|cover'd how bad, how dangerous and miserable their State by Nature is.&mdash;That this <HI>has been,</HI> is
<PB N="194" REF="005572_0201_0000000000000000">
evident from Scripture. <HI>Laodicea thought her self rich and encreased in Goods; and to have Need of Nothing, when she was poor and miserable, and wretched and blind and naked;</HI> and such there have always been, who <HI>think themselves something, when they are nothing, and deceive themselves.</HI>&mdash;And that such have not a true <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, whatever <HI>Per|swasion</HI> they entertain, is evident, in that Men can|not come to Christ for that which they don't feel the Want of; nor can they feel the Want of De|liverance from that lost and miserable State, which they have never had a sensible Discovery of. <HI>The whole need not the Physician.</HI>&mdash;It is also evident, in that saving Faith is a <HI>Dependance</HI> upon Christ alone for Salvation. For it is impossible to depend upon Christ alone, and yet to depend partly upon our selves for Salvation; as all such necessarily do, that have never felt their own impotent and lost Condition. The <HI>Antinomians,</HI> I know, disclaim all Pretensions to Self-Dependance. But whence, I beseech 'em, are the towring Imaginations of the divine Favour, which some of them entertain, while they have never been broken under the Sense of their Sin and Misery, never humbled nor lost, nor driven to Christ as a Refuge for guilty Sin|ners; but from an high Opinion of themselves? Whence do they <HI>thank God, that they are not as other Men;</HI> but from some imaginary Qualifications of their own? If they pretend to no other, they may still build upon this, that they have a <HI>Perswasion</HI> Christ will save them; and so they make that <HI>Per|swasion</HI> their Righteousness, and the Foundation of their Hope of Salvation. And this is still fur|ther evident, from the express Declaration of our blessed Saviour, that he <HI>came not to call the Righ|teous,
<PB N="195" REF="005572_0202_0000000000000000">
but Sinners to Repentance.</HI>&mdash;Inasmuch there|fore as such self-righteous Persons may have the strongest <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their own Justification by Christ, and yet have no Interest in him, whatever <HI>Perswasion</HI> they entertain, since he came not to call them while such to Repentance, it is most evident, that this <HI>Perswasion</HI> cannot be a saving <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;Moreover,</P>
<P>If this <HI>Perswasion</HI> may be entertain'd by those who are under the Power and Dominion of their Sins, it cannot be a saving <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;That this may be, is too evident from our constant Observation.&mdash;Who can be more tenaciously perswaded of their obtaining Salvation by Christ, than many of our careless and secure Sinners, who <HI>profess to know Christ, but in Works deny him, and are to every good Work reprobate?</HI>&mdash;That these cannot have a saving <HI>Faith,</HI> is evident. For <HI>Faith purifies the Heart:</HI> and <HI>he that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</HI>&mdash;Fur|thermore,</P>
<P>If this <HI>Perswasion</HI> may arise from <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Self|Esteem,</HI> it cannot be a saving <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;I think, no Man will pretend, that the Productions of our own proud and haughty Self-Esteem will interest us in the Favour of God; and give us a Claim to the Promises of the Gospel.&mdash;And we have numerous Instances of such in Scripture, who entertain'd <HI>this Perswasion</HI> from their own haughty Opinion of themselves. Such were <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company. <HI>All the Congregation are holy</HI> (say they) <HI>every one of them.</HI> Such were they in the Prophet, <HI>who said, Stand by thy self, come not near me; for I am holier than thou.</HI>&mdash;Such was the <HI>Pharisee,</HI> who <HI>thanked God, that he was not as other Men.</HI>&mdash;And such were the Body of the <HI>Jewish Rulers</HI> in our Saviour's Time.
<PB N="196" REF="005572_0203_0000000000000000">
<HI>We have one Father</HI> (say they) <HI>even God.</HI>&mdash;And I wish we had not constant Occasion to observe, that there are at this Time too many such among our|selves, who boast of this strong <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their justified State, and of their rapturous Joys, whose highest Attainment in Religion is, that they <HI>trust in themselves, that they are righteous; and despise o|thers.</HI>&mdash;Their false Apprehension of their own At|tainments begets this <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their good State: And this <HI>Perswasion</HI> heightens their Appre|hension of their great Attainments in Religion: And thus they go on in an unhappy Round of Pride and Self-Exaltation. Now can any pretend, that a saving <HI>Faith</HI> consists in Pride, and supercili|ous Vanity of Mind!&mdash;I may yet add,</P>
<P>If such a <HI>Perswasion</HI> may be a <HI>Diabolical</HI> Sugges|tion and <HI>Hellish</HI> Delusion, it cannot be a saving <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;This Consequence cannot be disputed by any, that allow a Difference between Light and Darkness, between CHRIST and <HI>Belial,</HI> between the Influences of the Spirit of God, and the Delusions of the Devil.&mdash;And I think, it will be allowed by all, that the Devil has Power, Craft, and Malice e|nough, thus to impose upon poor unwary Sinners, and delude them into Transports of Joy, for which they have no solid Grounds. That he may do so, is confirmed by the Apostle, who tells us, that <HI>Sa|tan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light.</HI>&mdash;&mdash;That he does so in Fact, is too often exemplifi|ed in the high rapturous Joys of some, who are o|penly and visibly irreligious.&mdash;I subjoin once more,</P>
<P>If such a <HI>Perswasion</HI> may be entertain'd by those who embrace the most dangerous and damnable <HI>Heresies,</HI> it cannot be a saving <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;That there may be such Heresies as are utterly inconsistent
<PB N="197" REF="005572_0204_0000000000000000">
with saving Faith, we are certain, both from the Nature of Things, and from the express Words of the Apostle, who informs us of such who <HI>shall be left to strong Delusions, to believe a Lie, that they may all be damned.</HI>&mdash;And constant Experience has convinced us, that the worst Hereticks, which have ever afflicted and infected the Church, have had the most undoubting <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their In|terest in Christ; and of the Love and Favour of God to them. Now, can such as these have a saving <HI>Faith?</HI></P>
<P>From every one of these Particulars it appears, that Men may entertain such a <HI>Perswasion</HI> of their Interest in Christ, as is <HI>false</HI> in Fact. And I think, there can't need any Arguments to con|vince you, that <HI>believing a Lie</HI> is not the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> which gives a Title to Salvation.&mdash;This then appears unquestionably true, that there may be a strong <HI>Perswasion</HI> of a justified State, WITHOUT saving <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P>And it is equally certain, that there may be a saving <HI>Faith,</HI> WITHOUT this <HI>Perswasion</HI> of an actual Interest in Christ.&mdash;I need not say much, to make this appear in a convincing Light.</P>
<P>If this <HI>Perswasion</HI> be no where found, in Scrip|ture, to belong to the <HI>Description</HI> of a saving <HI>Faith,</HI> a Man may be a true Believer without it.&mdash;This must be allowed to be a necessary Consequence, if there be any true and just Description of a saving Faith in the Bible.&mdash;And I think, I may confident|ly affirm, that this <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our Interest in Christ, that he will save us in particular, or that we are actually justified by his Righteousness, is no where found in Scripture, to be any Part of the
<PB N="198" REF="005572_0205_0000000000000000">
Description of a saving Faith. And there may consequently be a true Faith without it.&mdash;Besides,</P>
<P>This joyful <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our Interest in Christ and our justified State, is considered in the Scrip|tures as the <HI>Fruit</HI> and <HI>Consequence</HI> of a saving <HI>Faith.&mdash;Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God.&mdash;Believing, we rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> Whence it follows, that <HI>Faith</HI> may and must exist before it can bring forth Fruit; and that this <HI>Persuasion</HI> cannot be both Faith it self, and the Fruit or Effect of it too; and consequently, that there may be a true Faith without this <HI>Persua|sion,</HI> whereof I am treating.&mdash;I further add,</P>
<P>The Instances of <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>deserted Believers,</HI> in Scripture, and the many Promises and Encourage|ments given to such, do plainly and fully prove, that a true <HI>Faith</HI> may exist without this <HI>Perswasion.</HI>&mdash;There may be true Believers, <HI>who fear the Lord, and obey the Voice of his Servant, that walk in Dark|ness and see no Light,</HI> that are ready to conclude, <HI>the Lord hath forsaken them, and their God hath for|gotten them;</HI> who are yet <HI>graven upon the Palms of his Hands;</HI> and encouraged <HI>to hope in the Lord, as the Health of their Countenance and their God.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, if we may receive the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> upon the Terms of the Gospel, without a joyful <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our own good State, we may have a saving <HI>Faith</HI> without it.&mdash;This Consequence can't be opposed, because <HI>receiving the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> is the Gospel-Description of a saving Faith.&mdash;And that we may thus receive the Lord Jesus Christ without this joyful <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our own Interest in him, may be evidenced by a Variety of Ar|guments.</P>
<P>This is evident from the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, in
<PB N="199" REF="005572_0206_0000000000000000">
that the <HI>Act</HI> must necessarily precede the <HI>Evidence</HI> of it: And consequently our first Receiving the Lord Jesus Christ must necessarily preceed our Knowledge or grounded <HI>Perswasion</HI> of it; or else we must be perswaded of a Non-Entity, of what is false in Fact, and just as different from a saving Faith, as any other Falshood whatsoever.</P>
<P>This is likewise evident, that our receiving the Lord Jesus Christ, and our <HI>Perswasion</HI> of an Interest in him, are two very <HI>different Acts</HI> of the Mind, which no Ways imply each other.&mdash;It is one Act of the Mind, heartily to consent to the Gospel|Offer; and another Act of the Mind, quite dif|ferent and distinct, to entertain a joyful Perswasi|on, that this Consent flows from gracious Sinceri|ty. The former may and often does exist without the latter: and therefore Christ may be received by <HI>Faith,</HI> without the <HI>Perswasion</HI> of an Interest in him.</P>
<P>This is also evident, in that a true <HI>Faith</HI> may consist with a great Deal of remaining <HI>Unbelief.</HI>&mdash;He may sincerely receive Christ by <HI>Faith,</HI> who has Occasion to make that Exclamation, <HI>Lord, help my Unbelief!</HI> This may therefore so much darken the Mind, as to make the Believer uncapable of dis|cerning and being fully perswaded of the Sincerity of his Faith: And consequently true <HI>Faith</HI> may exist without this <HI>Perswasion;</HI> and a Man may have received the Lord Jesus Christ, who is in great Doubts and Darkness about it.</P>
<P>This is moreover evident, in that such an One may truly receive the Lord Jesus Christ upon his own Terms, who has no clear <HI>Idea</HI> of the Nature of justifying <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;He may have a believing Heart, who has but a weak and cloudy Head. He may
<PB N="200" REF="005572_0207_0000000000000000">
despair of all Help in himself, most earnestly de|sire an Interest in Christ, be heartily willing to com|ply with the Gospel-Offer, resolved to have Christ upon any Terms, and may trust in Christ alone for Salvation; who, notwithstanding, may have but very confused Apprehensions of the Nature of these Exercises of Soul, and of the Gospel-Promi|ses made to those who have attain'd them: And consequently may receive Christ by <HI>Faith,</HI> without this <HI>Perswasion</HI> of an Interest in him.&mdash;I may add once more,</P>
<P>This is also evident, in that <HI>all</HI> who receive the Lord Jesus Christ, have the Power or Privilege to <HI>become the Sons of God,</HI> whether they are <HI>perswaded</HI> of their Interest in Christ, or not. But all who are perswaded of their own good Estate, have not that Power or Privilege; for many of these are pre|sumptuous Sinners. Whence it follows, that to receive the Lord Jesus Christ by <HI>Faith,</HI> is one Thing; and to be <HI>perswaded</HI> of our Interest in him, is another Thing, quite distinct in its Nature and Consequences.</P>
<P>The second Thing which I mention'd, as a most dangerous Error in the <HI>Moravians</HI> and <HI>Antinomians,</HI> is the <HI>Part</HI> they assign to <HI>Faith</HI> in our <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P>The most of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> suppose, that our <HI>Justification,</HI> consider'd as a Freedom from Guilt or Condemnation and a Title to the Favour of God, was from <HI>Eternity.</HI> All of 'em suppose, at least we were thus justified from the Time of <HI>Christ's Death,</HI> before we had any actual existence.&mdash;Though the most of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> limit this Justification to the <HI>Elect</HI> only, the <HI>Moravians</HI> herein differ from their other <HI>Antinomian</HI> Brethren; and suppose, that all the World of Mankind, without Difference,

were actually justified, when Christ pronounced those Words upon the Cross, <HI>It is finished.</HI> Ac|cordingly Count <HI>Zinzendorf</HI> in the forecited Book tells us, <HI>"On the Cross he made a Confession for all the World, when he said,</HI> Father, forgive them; <HI>and when he cried out,</HI> It is finished, <HI>be gave Absolution to all wicked Rebels<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Discourses on the</HI> Redemption of Man. <HI>p.</HI> 31.</NOTE>&mdash;Whence it appears, that ac|cording to them, <HI>Faith</HI> it Christ has no Part at all in our Justification, considering this as a judicial Sentence of our Judge.&mdash;This <HI>Justification</HI> was not only precedent to our <HI>Faith,</HI> but to our very <HI>Existence:</HI> and according to the <HI>Moravian</HI> Divini|ty, Multitudes are thus <HI>justified,</HI> who never had, nor ever will have, any true <HI>Faith</HI> in Jesus Christ.&mdash;According to the Doctrine of all the <HI>Antinomians,</HI> the Elect are all justified before <HI>Faith;</HI> as already has been observed.</P>
<P>When these therefore speak of <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> they mean no more, than that <HI>Faith</HI> gives us the comfortable <HI>Evidence</HI> of that State of Peace and Favour with God, which we were in before: Or that it enables our <HI>Consciences</HI> now to pronounce the same Sentence concerning our State, which our <HI>Judge</HI> had pronounced before we were born.</P>

from the wild and extravagant Scheme I am opposing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scriptures</HI> every where shew us, that we are <HI>justified through Faith;</HI> that <HI>Christ's Righteousness</HI> is received by Faith; and that <HI>Righteousness shall be imputed to us, if we believe.</HI> But no where do they make mention of our Justification as <HI>prior</HI> to our believing in Christ. Thus we are taught, that <HI>the Righteousness of God is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe;</HI> that <HI>God hath set forth</HI> Christ <HI>to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness for the Remission of Sins.</HI> Rom. iii. 22, 25. Now then can it possibly be true, that we are justified in the Sight of God <HI>before</HI> we believe in Christ; and yet interested in the Righteousness of God <HI>by</HI> the Faith of Jesus Christ? Can it be true, that Christ is our Propi|tiation, and declares his Righteousness for the Re|mission of our Sins, <HI>through</HI> Faith in his Blood; and yet that his Propitiation and his Righteous|ness for the Remission of our Sins, are applied to us <HI>before</HI> and <HI>without</HI> and Faith in his Blood?&mdash;The Scriptures teach us, that <HI>the Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</HI> Rom. i. 17. and that <HI>there is one God who shall justify the Circumcision by Faith, and Uncircumcision 'thro' Faith.</HI> Rom. iii. 30.

we accepted as righteous in the Sight of God, not only <HI>before</HI> we did <HI>believe,</HI> but before it was <HI>possible</HI> for us to <HI>believe,</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ?&mdash;The Scrip|tures teach us, that <HI>a Man is justified by Faith, with|out the Deeds of the Law,</HI> Rom. iii. 28. that <HI>God imputeth Righteousness without Works,</HI> Rom. iv. 6. that <HI>we are justified by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</HI> Gal. ii. 16. that we are <HI>justified by his Grace,</HI> Titus iii. 7. that <HI>we are saved by Grace, through Faith,</HI> Eph. ii. 8. that <HI>Righteousness is imputed to all that believe,</HI> Rom. iv.

This is the constant Language of the Word of God.&mdash;These wild Notions of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> are therefore as repugnant to the whole Tenor of the Scriptures, as they are to Reason and common Sense.</P>
<P>I am aware, that they have an <HI>Evasion</HI> at Hand, by which they pretend to solve this Difficulty: and that is, That our <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> means no more than the <HI>Manifestation</HI> of our Justification to our own <HI>Consciences;</HI> or an inward <HI>Perswasion</HI> and Satisfaction of our justified State.&mdash;But this is too trifling, to deserve any serious Consideration.&mdash;Is not <HI>Faith,</HI> according to them, a <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our justified State? And are <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> the same Thing? Are we justified by <HI>Faith;</HI> and yet are we to consider <HI>Faith</HI> as our <HI>Justification</HI> itself? If <HI>Faith</HI> be a <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our Interest in Christ and our actual Salvation by him, and if <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> likewise be a <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our Interest in Christ and our actual Salvation by him, then <HI>Faith</HI>

is <HI>Justification,</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> is <HI>Faith;</HI> the Terms are convertible, and mutually imply each other: and consequently we can, with no Propriety of Ex|pression, be said to be <HI>justified by Faith.</HI>&mdash;This Gloss of theirs is not therefore to explain Scripture; but to render it obscure, inconsistent, and unintel|ligible. There is nothing more plainly, expresly, and repeatedly affirm'd in Scripture, than that we are justified <HI>by Faith,</HI> and <HI>through Faith;</HI> and that the Righteousness of Christ becomes ours <HI>by or through Faith:</HI> and if this means no more, than that we have the Knowledge, the Manifestation or Per|swasion of our Justification, by <HI>Faith,</HI> then Language can be no longer useful to convey Ideas: for the Words may be interpreted in any other Sense, with as much Propriety as in this, forc'd upon 'em by our <HI>Antinomian</HI> Interpreters.&mdash;If it be but the <HI>Know|ledge</HI> or <HI>Perswasion</HI> of our <HI>Justification,</HI> that is ascri|bed to <HI>Faith,</HI> then we may as properly be said to be <HI>elected</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> to be <HI>created</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> or to be <HI>redeemed</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> as to be <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Faith.</HI> For we have the <HI>Knowledge</HI> or Perswasion of those Things by <HI>Faith;</HI> as well as of this: And the Expression (so understood) is just as absurd and ridiculous in this Case, as in the other.</P>
<P>Besides, <HI>Declarative</HI> or manifestative <HI>Justification</HI> is not by <HI>Faith alone, but by Works also;</HI> as the A|postle <HI>James</HI> largely shews us, throughout the se|cond Chapter of his Epistle. It is therefore evi|dent and certain, that where the Scripture speaks of our <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith alone, without the Deeds of the Law,</HI> it cannot intend a mere declarative or manifestative, but an actual <HI>sentential</HI> Justification: unless we would put the Scripture into highest Opposition and Contrariety to it self.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="005572_0212_0000000000000000">But it's high Time I should proceed to the <HI>second</HI> Thing proposed; which is, to consider some of the horrible <HI>Consequences,</HI> that must necessarily flow from this <HI>Antinomian</HI> Scheme.</P>
<P>It must follow from this Doctrine of theirs, that there are many <HI>Unbelievers,</HI> who are not in a State of <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and are not the Objects of GOD's <HI>Wrath</HI> and Displeasure; though our Lord himself assures us, that <HI>he who believeth not, is condemned al|ready;</HI> and <HI>hath the Wrath of God abiding on him.</HI> John iii. 18, 36. For there can be no greater Re|pugnancy, than to be justified and condemned at the same Time. And this may probably be Count <HI>Zinzendorf's</HI> Meaning, in that odd Saying of his: <HI>"He that will condemn natural Men, who neither have nor can have the Lord Jesus in their Hearts, &mdash;meddles with an Affair, that does not at all belong to him.</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Discourses on the Redemption of Man. p. 70.</NOTE></P>
<P>It will also follow from hence, that there is <HI>no Need</HI> of any <HI>Care</HI> or <HI>Pains,</HI> to get into a State of Peace or Favour with God. For why should I take Pains to obtain, what I have already; or else what it is impossible that I ever should have?&mdash;It is enough upon this Supposal, to attend the <HI>Count's</HI> Advice. <HI>"Here one should do Nothing, but quietly attend the Voice of the Lord.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Pag. 29.</NOTE>&mdash;There can be no Need to excite any to the Use of Means; but according to another Direction of his, <HI>"As long as People pursue their sinful Course with Pleasure, and do not see their Danger, one must have Patience with them.</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Pag. 90.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="005572_0213_0000000000000000">It will likewise follow, that the more <HI>Confidence</HI> the greatest <HI>Sinner</HI> in the World entertains, of the Safety of his State by the Merits of Christ, the more <HI>acceptable</HI> will he be to God; and the more will he promote his own Happiness. Thus <HI>Pre|sumption</HI> is so far from being sinful or dangerous, that it is our greatest Duty and Safety.&mdash;This Con|sequence the <HI>Count</HI> seems to allow. <HI>There is</HI> (says he) <HI>no Sinner to whom Satan has not lost all his Claim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Whoremongers and Thieves, ye revengeful and Murderers, yet Liars and whoever ye are, ye Fear|ful and Unbelieving, that hear and read this, will ye be saved?

<P>You may perhaps imagine, that we are not to take an Estimate of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> Principles, from the <HI>Count's</HI> Concessions.

<P>How extravagant is the Pretence of the actual <HI>Justification</HI> of a Non-Entity; of Pardon to those who never offended; or of Reconciliation to God, before there was any Distance or Alienation from

For all these Things were as truly the Objects of the divine Counsel, as our <HI>Justification;</HI> and in that Respect as actually true from Eternity, or from the Time of Christ's Death, as that would be.</P>
<P>How inconsistent and absurd is the strange Ap|prehension, that Sinners are actually <HI>justified,</HI> re|conciled to God, and instated in his Favour, while yet habitually indulging their Lusts, and going on boldly and impenitently in Sin and Enmity to God; as is the Case of all Men before Conversion and Faith in Christ!&mdash;Are Men's Hearts and Lives contrary to God; and yet God pleased with them at the same Time?&mdash;Are they condemned already, the Children of Wrath; and yet reconciled to God, and at Peace with him?&mdash;Are they of their Father the Devil, whose Works they do; and yet the Children of God, and Heirs of eternal Glory?&mdash;Can Heaven and Hell be blended together?&mdash;Is the Service of <HI>Christ</HI> and of <HI>Belial</HI> equally agreable to a pure and holy God? and the greatest practi|cal, as well as speculative Contradictions, reconci|lable to Truth?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is indeed as you represent it, <Q><HI>A Matter of greatest Consequence, to have a right View of the Way and Means by which God will be re|conciled to you, and by which you may have a Title to Life eternal.</HI></Q> I am glad, that you so kindly accept the Pains I've taken, to set the <HI>Antinomian</HI> Doctrine of Justification in its proper Colours.

<P>But <Q><HI>you yet are, as you have all along been, in great Difficulties on the other Side of the Question:
<PB N="211" REF="005572_0218_0000000000000000">
And cannot see into the Doctrine of a Sinner's Jus|tification by</HI> the imputed Righteousness of CHRIST. <HI>You have been lately reading upon that Subject; and find many Arguments against it, that you cannot get over. Your Author represents it as unscriptural, and unreasonable: You therefore desire me to give you a right View of that Doctrine, and to answer your Ob|jections against it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is indeed, Sir, no Cause for you to <Q><HI>sus|pect, that you shall wear out my Patience.</HI></Q> I glad|ly embrace the Opportunity, to do any Thing in my Power to give you Satisfaction; and to assist you in your greatest Concern, which you have Reason to be most solicitous about. I shall there|fore according to your Desire, endeavour in the first Place to give you a brief View of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of our <HI>Justification</HI> by the <HI>imputed</HI> Righteousness of CHRIST; before I proceed to consider your <HI>Ob|jections</HI> against it.</P>
<P>I shall first consider what we are to understand by <HI>Justification;</HI> and in what Sense that Expressi|on is used in Scripture.&mdash;Should I herein follow some of our wrangling Disputants, I know not how many distinct Meanings of the Word <HI>Justification</HI> I might set before you. But this would be to dar|ken Counsel, by Words without Knowledge; the Term having one invariable Meaning, throughout the whole Bible.&mdash;It always (as far as I have been able to observe) constantly signifies being <HI>esteem'd, declared, manifested, or pronounced righteous.</HI> This is what the original Word, both in the old and new Testament, naturally signifies: And in this Sense only, it is always used. I need not therefore undertake, to give Instances of the Use of the Word in this Sense, since in all Instances it is used
<PB N="212" REF="005572_0219_0000000000000000">
in this Sense only. This, I believe, must be ac|knowledged by every one, that will throughly and impartially examine the Case. I think, there can no Text be found, where <HI>Justification</HI> is used for making us <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">crently</HI> righteous.</P>
<P>But though this Word has one invariable Signi|fication, it is used in Scripture in a threefold Re|spect: either for our present <HI>Justification</HI> in the Sight of God, for our <HI>Justification</HI> before Men and our own Consciences, or for our <HI>Justification</HI> at the Tribunal of our Judge at the last Day.&mdash;It is the first of these, that falls under our present Conside|ration: which is to be consider'd as our <HI>Acquittance from Guilt, and our Acceptance with God as righteous in his Sight.</HI> It is to be considered as a Sentence of Absolution and Acceptation, by the great Judge of the World.&mdash;As <HI>Justification</HI> therefore is always consider'd in Scripture as a forensick or juridical Sentence, it should be carefully distinguished from the Infusion of a Principle of Grace, or inherent Righteousness.&mdash;<HI>Justification</HI> is usually in Scripture opposed to <HI>Condemnation.</HI> As this latter therefore does not imply the rendring Men wicked and guil|ty, but pronouncing them so: Even so the former likewise cannot mean rendring Men righteous, but sententially declaring and pronouncing them so. Were this duly attended to, many of the Objecti|ons made against our Doctrine of <HI>Justification by the Righteousness of Christ,</HI> would vanish of Course. You'll be pleased therefore all along to carry this in your Mind, that I am not considering how we should become inherently righteous, by a Renova|tion of our Nature: but how we may be acquit|ted from Guilt, and accepted as righteous, by the Sentence of our glorious Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="005572_0220_0000000000000000">I proceed to consider what we are to understand by the <HI>Imputation</HI> of Christ's Righteousness.</P>
<P>To <HI>impute,</HI> is to judge or esteem any Matter, Character or Quality, whether good or evil, to belong to a Person <HI>as his.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> either refer to what was originally his, antecedently to such <HI>Imputation;</HI> or to what was not antecedently his, but becomes so by Virtue of such Imputation only. The Scriptures abound with Instances of both these Sorts of <HI>Imputation.</HI></P>
<P>We have many Instances in Scripture of <HI>imputing</HI> that to a Person, which was originally his own, and performed by him antecedently to such <HI>Imputation.</HI> Thus, <HI>Sin</HI> is said to be imputed to the Sinner, when he is judged or treated as an Offender. <HI>Let not my Lord</HI> (says <HI>Shimei) impute Iniquity into me.</HI> 2 Sam. xix. 19. And thus Righteousness is <HI>imputed</HI> to the Saint, when he is judged or acknowledged <HI>Righteous</HI> (in a qualify'd Sense) with Relation to a particular Fact, done in Conformity to the <HI>pre|ceptive</HI> Part of the Divine Law. <HI>Then stood up</HI> Phinehas, <HI>and executed Judgment, and it was im|puted to him for Righteousness.</HI> Psalm. cvi. 31. But this is not the <HI>Imputation</HI> now to be considered, which respects a <HI>Justification,</HI> that is proposed as the Relief as a sinful perishing World, against the Penalty of the condemning <HI>Law,</HI> and implies a Change of the Sinner's <HI>State,</HI> from <HI>Guilt</HI> to <HI>Grace,</HI> from <HI>Death</HI> to <HI>Life,</HI> in a relative Sense.</P>
<P>I proceed then to observe, that also may be said to be <HI>imputed</HI> to a Person, which was <HI>not</HI> his own originally or antecedently; but is judged and es|teemed to belong to him, and is his on Account of such <HI>Imputation</HI> only. Thus, a Debt is <HI>imputed</HI> to a Surety; and the Surety's Payment of a Debt is <HI>impu|ted</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="005572_0221_0000000000000000">
to the principal Debtor, and is pleadable by him in Discharge from his Creditor's Demands.&mdash;<HI>If he have wronged thee, or oweth thee ought,</HI> (says <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Onesimus) put that on my Account</HI> (To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> TO EMOIEAAOTI) <HI>impute it unto me.</HI> Thus our Sins are <HI>imputed</HI> unto Christ; inasmuch as he in the Character of our Surety, has undertaken to dis|charge those Debts to the Justice of God. And thus his Righteousness is <HI>imputed</HI> unto us; it having been wrought out in our Place and Stead, and given to God in Payment on our Behalf.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, we are to under|stand the <HI>Imputation</HI> in Question, to be God's gra|cious Donation of the perfect Righteousness of Christ to Believers, and his Acceptation of their Persons as righteous, on the Account thereof.&mdash;Their Sins being <HI>imputed</HI> to him, and his Obedi|ence being <HI>imputed</HI> to them, they are in Virtue hereof both acquitted from Guilt and accepted as righteous before God.</P>
<P>We are not therefore to understand our <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> by the <HI>imputed Righteousness</HI> of Christ as im|plying and supposing, that <HI>God</HI> does esteem Belie|vers to be what indeed they are <HI>not.</HI> He esteems them to be poor sinful imperfect Men, who have no otherwise satisfied the Claims of his Justice, and the Demands of the Law, than by the <HI>Obedience</HI> of their <HI>Surety:</HI> Which is really by a gracious <HI>Impu|tation</HI> become theirs, and they are on the Account thereof become indeed righteous in God's Sight; although antecedent to that <HI>Imputation,</HI> they were legally condemned Criminals, and though they yet remain inherently imperfect and sinful Creatures.</P>
<P>We are further to consider, that this Righteous|ness of Christ is <HI>imputed</HI> to none but <HI>Believers;</HI> but
<PB N="215" REF="005572_0222_0000000000000000">
is (as the Apostle expresses it) <HI>revealed from Faith to Faith.</HI> It is not <HI>imputed</HI> before we have Faith, as the <HI>Antinomians</HI> dream; nor is the <HI>Imputation</HI> delay'd, till the Fruits and Effects of Faith in an obedient Life appear, as some others seem to sup|pose: but it is <HI>imputed</HI> at and upon our believ|ing. <HI>It shall be imputed, if we believe,</HI> Rom. iv. 24. Faith is the <HI>Receiving</HI> an offered Saviour <HI>(Job. i. 12.)</HI> in his Person, his Offices, and all his Benefits; and therefore it is a <HI>Receiving</HI> his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which is one of his Benefits, freely offered in the Gospel, to all that will accept it.</P>
<P>So I'm prepared to observe to you, that we are to understand our <HI>Justification</HI> by the <HI>imputed</HI> Righ|teousness of Christ, to signify and imply, <HI>A graci|ous Sentence of God, whereby a Sinner antecedently guilty in his Sight, is upon his believing in Christ, ac|quitted from Guilt, accepted as righteous, and intitled to all the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, on Ac|count of what Christ has done and suffer'd for him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured in as few Words as possible, to give you a just and clear View of the Doctrine before us; and am now ready to con|sider your <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>You first object, that <Q><HI>the</HI> Imputation <HI>of our Sins to Christ, or the</HI> Imputation <HI>of Christ's Righteous|ness to us, are no where mentioned in the Word of God; that the Terms and Expressions used in this Case, are certainly of human Invention; and the Doctrine therefore to be suspected, as having its Ori|ginal rather from our scholastic Divines, than from the Oracles of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Your first Supposal is, that the <HI>Imputation</HI> of <HI>our Sins</HI> to CHRIST, is no where mention'd in the Word of God.&mdash;If you mean by this, that we no where
<PB N="216" REF="005572_0223_0000000000000000">
in Scripture find that <HI>Proposition,</HI> in so many ex|press Words, that our <HI>Sins are imputed to Christ,</HI> this is true: but I hope to shew you it is altogether impertinent.&mdash;But if you mean by this, that we can no where find full, clear and undeniable <HI>E|vidence</HI> from <HI>Scripture,</HI> of the <HI>Imputation</HI> of the Sins of Believers to Christ, I will endeavour immedi|ately to convince you of your Mistake.</P>
<P>The whole <HI>Levitical</HI> Dispensation was purposely design'd to represent this comfortable Truth to us. This was the End of all their Sacrifices, and bloody Oblations for the Remissions of their Sins.&mdash;They did not imagine, or at least God did not design they should imagine, that their Sin and Guilt was actually, to all Intents and Purposes, transfer|red from the Offender to the <HI>Victim:</HI> but they were hereby led to look to Christ, the <HI>Antitype</HI> of all their Sin-Offerings, in Faith and Hope, that their Sins should all be <HI>imputed to him;</HI> and themselves through the Merit of <HI>his Sacrifice,</HI> be acquitted from Guilt.&mdash;This Design of all their expiatory Sacrifi|ces was more clearly exhibited to them, in the In|stitution of the <HI>Scape-Goat;</HI> where the <HI>Imputation</HI> of our Sins to Christ was in the most lively Man|ner represented. <HI>And Aaron shall lay both his Hands upon the Head of the live Goat; and confess over him all the Iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all their Transgressions in all their Sins, putting them upon the Head of the Goat; and shall send him away, by the Hand of a fit Man, into the Wilderness; and the Goat shall bear upon him all their Iniquities, unto the Land not inhabited.</HI> Lev. xvi. 21, 22.&mdash;Here was a plain and express Commutation, or transferring of Guilt from God's People to the <HI>Scape-Goat.</HI> All the Iniquities of God's People, all their Transgres|sions
<PB N="217" REF="005572_0224_0000000000000000">
in all their Sins, were laid upon his Head.&mdash;He bore upon him all their Iniquities: Or in other Words, their Sins were <HI>imputed</HI> to him. Now you can't suppose, that all the Hopes of the Children of Israel terminated upon this <HI>Goat.</HI> You must suppose, that they look'd to the great <HI>Antitype,</HI> to whom their Guilt was indeed to be transferred, and their Sins <HI>imputed;</HI> and from whom they expected their Discharge and Justification.&mdash;Hence it plainly appears, that all the Hopes, which the Church of God in all the Ages and Dispensa|tions thereof have entertained, of the Forgiveness of Sin and Reconciliation to God, was through the <HI>Imputation</HI> of their Sins to Christ, the Substance of all the <HI>Levitical</HI> Shadows, and the only true Sin|Offering.</P>
<P>The same Doctrine, which was so plainly poin|ted out by these typical Rites, is fully and abun|dantly confirm'd, by very many plain and clear <HI>Passages of Scripture,</HI> which cannot, with any Ap|pearance of Propriety, be construed in any other Sense, than that I am pleading for.&mdash;Thus, Isai. liii. 6, 11. <HI>The Lord hath laid upon him the Iniquity of us all.&mdash;For he shall bear their Iniquities.</HI>&mdash;2. Cor. v. 21. <HI>For he hath made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> Gal. iii. 13, <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 24. <HI>Who his own self bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</HI>&mdash;Many other Texts to the like Purpose might be quoted: but these are every Way sufficient to decide this Point.</P>
<P>If <HI>the Iniquity of us all</HI> could be <HI>laid upon Christ,</HI> and he <HI>bear our Iniquities,</HI> no other Way but by <HI>Imputation,</HI> it then appears from <HI>Isa.</HI> liii. that our
<PB N="218" REF="005572_0225_0000000000000000">
Iniquities were <HI>imputed</HI> to him. And I think, the Adversaries of this Doctrine can make no rational Pretence to any other Way, in which our Sins can be said to be <HI>laid upon</HI> Christ, and he be said to <HI>bear</HI> our Iniquities.</P>
<P>If Christ has been <HI>made Sin for us,</HI> according to 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> v. he must be made <HI>Sin</HI> for us (and treat|ed as a Sinner) either by his own personal Fault, or by the <HI>Imputation</HI> of our Sin to him. I can think of no other possible Way, in which this can be supposed, but one of these two. Now the Blas|phemy of the former Supposition obliges us to re|ject it with Abhorrence: and therefore the latter must be allowed.</P>
<P>If Christ hath been made a <HI>Curse for us,</HI> accor|ding to <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. he must then have the Violation of the Law <HI>imputed</HI> to him; otherwise the <HI>Curse</HI> of it could not in Justice have been inflicted upon him. To inflict the <HI>Curse,</HI> or Penalty of a Law, upon one no Ways chargeable with the Violation of it, is contrary to the Justice both of God and Man. And I can imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e no other Way, by which our blessed Saviour could be chargeable with the Violation of the Law of God, and thereby be ob|noxious to the <HI>Curse</HI> of it; but through the <HI>Im|putation</HI> of <HI>our</HI> Sin and Guilt to him.</P>
<P>If our blessed Saviour <HI>bare our Sins in his own Body,</HI> and was punished for our Sins, upon the <HI>Cross,</HI> according to <HI>I Pet.</HI> ii. Our Sins then must be laid to his Charge, and punished upon him, either by <HI>Imputation,</HI> or some other Way.&mdash;Here then let our Adversaries speak Sense, and tell us, if they can, what other Way this could possibly be done.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, if I am forc'd to tell you, that 'tis too trifling an Evasion to be adopted by Men of
<PB N="219" REF="005572_0226_0000000000000000">
Learning and Sense, to urge against us, that the Word <HI>Imputation</HI> is not used in this Case in Scrip|ture, when so many Expressions are used in Scrip|ture, which fully and necessarily imply it, and are of the same Significancy.&mdash;True, we do not read in express Words, that our Sins were <HI>imputed</HI> to Christ: But we do read in express Words, that our Iniquities were <HI>laid upon him;</HI> that he <HI>bare</HI> them; that he was <HI>made Sin,</HI> or legally reputed a Sinner, on the Account of them: that he <HI>bare them in his own Body,</HI> or was punished for them, upon the <HI>Cross;</HI> and bore the <HI>Curse of the Law,</HI> which we had violated.&mdash;And if all this don't amount to the same Thing, as the <HI>Imputation</HI> of our Sins to Christ, I must forever despair of understanding the Mean|ing of the most plain and familiar Expressions.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, allow me the Freedom to observe to you, that you have been guilty of innumerable Sins: If these have not been <HI>imputed</HI> to Christ, if he hath not <HI>born your Sins,</HI> if he hath not satisfied the divine Justice on Account of them, they must yet be <HI>imputed</HI> to you, and you must <HI>bear your Iniqui|ty</HI> yourself: You must yet be under the Guilt of all your Sins, and under all the Curses of the bro|ken Law.&mdash;A Thought, which will administer but little Comfort here; and less at the Tribunal of Christ, if this should then be found to be your Case. A Thought big with Horror!</P>
<P>I now proceed to consider, whether the <HI>Imputa|tion of Christ's Righteousness to us,</HI> is no where men|tioned in the Word of God. I must here again acknowledge, that this Proposition, <HI>Christ's Righte|ousness is imputed to Believers,</HI> is no where to be found in the Scriptures, in express Terms. But then we have so many full and clear Testimonies
<PB N="220" REF="005572_0227_0000000000000000">
in Scripture, to the Doctrine contain'd in that Pro|position, that there can be no Reason to call the Truth of it into Question. Thus, Jer. xxiii. 6. <HI>This is the Name whereby he shall be called. The Lord our Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;Rom. iii. 25, 26. <HI>Whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness for the Remission of Sins, &mdash;to declare at this Time his Righteousness; that be might be just, and the Justifier of him which belie|veth in Jesus.</HI>&mdash;Rom. v. 18, 19. <HI>Therefore as by the Offence of one,</HI> Judgment came <HI>upon all Men to Condemnation: even so by the Righteousness of one,</HI> the free Gift came <HI>upon all Men unto Justification of Life. For as by one Man's Disobedience, many were made Sinners: So by the Obedience of One, shall many be made righteous.</HI>&mdash;Rom. viii. 3, 4. <HI>God sending his own Son, in the Likeness of sinful Flesh and for Sin, condemned Sin in the Flesh, that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</HI>&mdash;Rom. x. 4. <HI>For Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that Believeth.</HI>&mdash;I Cor. i. 30. <HI>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Re|demption.</HI>&mdash;2. Cor. v. 21. <HI>That we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI></P>
<P>I might have added very many more Texts of Scripture to the same Purpose: but how can more be needful, to satisfy any Man, in the Truth of our <HI>Justification by the Imputation of Christ's Righteous|ness,</HI> who attentively reads, and impartially weighs these cited Texts, without Prejudice against the Doctrine, or a Biass to some favourite Scheme?&mdash;Let it be consider'd, Here we are expresly assur|ed, that Christ is <HI>the Lord our Righteousness;</HI> that 'tis by <HI>his Righteousness</HI> we obtain Remission of
<PB N="221" REF="005572_0228_0000000000000000">
Sins; that by <HI>his Righteousness</HI> God is the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus; that by <HI>his Righ|teousness</HI> we have Justification of Life; and by <HI>his Obedience</HI> we are made righteous; that by his being sent <HI>for Sin,</HI> and condemning Sin, the <HI>Righteousness of the Law</HI> is fulfilled in <HI>us;</HI> that he is the <HI>End of the Law for Righteousness</HI> to the Believer; that he is of God made unto us <HI>Righteousness;</HI> and we are made the <HI>Righteousness of God in him.</HI>&mdash;Is it possi|ble, that the Doctrine I am pleading for, should be expressed in plainer and stronger Terms?&mdash;The Word <HI>Impute,</HI> or <HI>Imputation,</HI> is not indeed found in these Texts; but the Thing intended by it, is plainly found there. Let that be allowed; and I shall maintain no Controversy with you about the Meaning or Use of a Word.&mdash;Let it be allowed, That Christ has fulfilled the Righteousness of the Law for Believers, That his Righteousness is become theirs, That they have thereby Remission of Sins, are jus|tified before God, and made righteous: let these Things be own'd; and it won't be of so great Importance, whether you consent to the Propriety of the Word <HI>Imputation,</HI> in this Case, or not. Now these Things you must allow, or deny the very Language of the quoted Texts: And by allowing these Things, you will allow all that is intended by those who plead for the <HI>Imputation</HI> of Christ's Righteousness.&mdash;But why must the Word <HI>Impute,</HI> or <HI>Imputation,</HI> be found Fault with? Be pleased to read the <HI>fourth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and ob|serve how often <HI>Righteousness</HI> is there said to be <HI>imputed</HI> to them that believe. Though the <HI>Righ|teousness</HI> there said to be <HI>imputed,</HI> is not expresly called <HI>the Righteousness of Christ;</HI> yet that is fully implied. For it was a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> whereby

<HI>Abraham</HI> was justified. (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 2.) A <HI>Righteousness with|out Works.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 6.) A <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by which <HI>our Sins are covered,</HI> that <HI>the Lord will not impute them.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 6, 7.) A <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by which God is the <HI>Father of all them that believe.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 11.) And a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> through which <HI>Abraham</HI> had <HI>the Pro|mise, that he should be the Heir of the World.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 13.)&mdash;Now can any Man pretend to a <HI>personal</HI> Righ|teousness, which all these Characters are fairly ap|plicable to? Or can these Characters justly be applied to any other, save the <HI>Righteousness of Christ</HI> only?</P>
<P>I hope, by this Time, you are convinced, that the <HI>Scripture</HI> is not a Stranger to the Doctrine of <HI>Justification</HI> by the <HI>imputed</HI> Righteousness of Christ. I would therefore (Sir) intreat you to consider, it is of infinite Consequence, that you your self be not a Stranger to that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which you may receive this <HI>Righteousness,</HI> may have this <HI>imputed</HI> to you, and may in Virtue of this be accepted (your Person and your sincere Performances) as <HI>righteous before God.</HI></P>
<P>But I have been too tedious in my Answer to your first Objection. I therefore hasten to con|sider what you have further to object against this important Truth.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Your Author</HI> (you tell me) <HI>argues, that if</HI> Faith <HI>be</HI> imputed for Righteousness, <HI>unto the Justifica|tion of a Sinner, then</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Obedience cannot be imputed to that End; unless</HI> our Faith <HI>and</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness be supposed to be the same Thing: That there is nothing more evident, than that</HI> Faith <HI>(which is so often said to be</HI> imputed for Righte|ousness, Rom. iv.) <HI>is properly our own personal Righteousness: That the Word,</HI> Faith (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">)
<PB N="223" REF="005572_0230_0000000000000000">
<HI>signifies</HI> Faithfulness, <HI>as well as believing; and includes evangelical</HI> Obedience <HI>in the Nature of it: That God deals with us as</HI> moral Agents; <HI>and imputes to us the Righteousness which we per|sonally have, and not that which we personally have</HI> not.</Q></P>
<P>I take this to be the most plausible, and the most weighty Objection against the Doctrine under Consideration, that has ever been made: And it therefore deserves to be distinctly taken Notice of. I shall accordingly endeavour to shew, that the <HI>Faith,</HI> which is <HI>imputed</HI> UNTO <HI>Righteousness</HI> (for so, I think, should the Words be rendred) does not include <HI>Obedience</HI> in the Nature of it. I shall proceed to prove, that the <HI>Faith</HI> which is <HI>imputed</HI> to Believers <HI>unto their Justification,</HI> is not their own personal <HI>Righteousness.</HI> And then endeavour to make it evident, that if <HI>your Construction</HI> of those Passages in <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. were granted, it would make Nothing <HI>against</HI> the Doctrine of our <HI>Justification</HI> by the <HI>imputed Righteousness of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I am first to shew, that the <HI>Faith,</HI> which is <HI>im|puted</HI> unto <HI>Righteousness,</HI> does not include <HI>Obedience</HI> in the Nature of it; considering <HI>Faith</HI> in its Refe|rence to <HI>Justification,</HI> or (as some express them|selves) in its <HI>Office of justifying.</HI>&mdash;For, though a true and lively <HI>Faith</HI> has its Influence in <HI>purifying</HI> the Hearts and Lives of Men, and producing Obe|dience; yet it's of the very Nature of <HI>Faith,</HI> to exclude all Opinion of Merit in our selves, to re|spect the Promise of God's Mercy, and directly send us to CHRIST for <HI>Justification</HI> and Acceptance with God, through his Merits and Righteousness. So that <HI>justifying</HI> Faith, <HI>as such,</HI> does not include in its Nature, Works of Obedience.&mdash;I need not
<PB N="224" REF="005572_0231_0000000000000000">
use many Arguments to prove this; the Apostle having in the plainest and strongest Terms declar|ed it. It is the very Scope and Design of the Apostle's Argument in this <HI>fourth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to prove, that we are <HI>justified by</HI> Faith, <HI>without Works.</HI> This was the Argument of the preceding Chapter; which is confirmed and illus|trated in this, by the Examples of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David. For if</HI> Abraham <HI>were justified by Works, he hath whereof to glory: but not before God. For what saith the Scripture?</HI> Abraham <HI>believed God; and it was counted unto him for Righteousness. Now to him that worketh, is the Reward reckoned, not of Grace, but of Debt. But to him that worketh not, but be|lieveth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him that justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness. Even as</HI> David <HI>also de|scribeth the Blessedness of the Man, unto whom God im|puteth Righteousness, without Works.</HI> Rom. v. 2, &mdash;6.</P>
<P>The Apostle is here using a Variety of unan|swerable Arguments, against the Doctrine I am now impleading. He argues, that if <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith had included <HI>Works</HI> or Obedience in it, he would <HI>have had whereof to glory.</HI> All <HI>Works,</HI> all Acts of Obedience whatsoever, are formally <HI>our own,</HI> be|ing done by our selves; and therefore may be <HI>glo|ried of,</HI> as such: but <HI>Abraham</HI> had not <HI>whereof to glory before God;</HI> and therefore <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith did not include <HI>Works</HI> of Obedience in the Nature of it, considering it as <HI>counted to him for Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;He next shews us, that if we had the Benefit of <HI>Justi|fication,</HI> as a <HI>Reward,</HI> upon the Account of any <HI>Works,</HI> of any Obedience whatsoever, the Reward would not be of <HI>Grace,</HI> but of <HI>Debt.</HI> For by what|ever Law, by whatever Covenant-Transaction, a <HI>Reward</HI> becomes due to any Sort of <HI>Works,</HI> or
<PB N="225" REF="005572_0232_0000000000000000">
Obedience, it is however become <HI>due;</HI> and may be claim'd as a <HI>Debt,</HI> upon the Performance of such <HI>Works,</HI> or Obedience. Whence it follows, that no Sort of Obedience, either legal or evangelical, can be included in the Nature of a <HI>justifying</HI> Faith, <HI>as such,</HI> if we are justified of <HI>Grace</HI> and not of <HI>Debt.</HI>&mdash;He shews us, that where <HI>Faith is imputed,</HI> unto <HI>Righteousness,</HI> it is imputed to him <HI>that worketh not,</HI> that doeth no <HI>Works of Righteousness</HI> at all, depen|deth upon none at all of his own doing, in Order to his <HI>Justification:</HI> And therefore it cannot pos|sibly be, that such <HI>Faith</HI> has any Sort of <HI>Works,</HI> any Sort of Obedience, included in the Nature of it, <HI>as</HI> it is a <HI>justifying</HI> Faith. It <HI>justifies</HI> only as it receives a Divine <HI>Gift,</HI> freely offered; or in the Apostle's Language, as it <HI>believeth on him who jus|tifieth the Ungodly.</HI> Here is no Room left for any Evasion. After never so many critical Distincti|ons are made, <HI>Him that worketh not,</HI> is <HI>Him that worketh not.</HI>&mdash;He moreover shews us, that the <HI>Faith</HI> under Consideration is a <HI>Believing on him that jus|tifies the Ungodly:</HI> and therefore cannot include evangelical Obedience in the Nature of it; unless evangelical Obedience, and <HI>Ungodliness,</HI> be the same Thing.&mdash;It is true, that a Person when <HI>justified,</HI> or when exercising that <HI>Faith</HI> through which he is justified, ceases to be in his State and habitual Course <HI>ungodly;</HI> for he has a <HI>Faith</HI> which not only sends him to CHRIST for Justification, but for <HI>Sanc|tification</HI> too, and which not only embraces the Promise, but the <HI>Precept</HI> too, and is a vital active. Principle of all <HI>Obedience.</HI> But then there is no Moment of Time intervenes between his State of <HI>Ungodliness</HI> and his <HI>Justification.</HI>&mdash;He further shews, that God <HI>imputeth Righteousness,</HI> for our Justification,
<PB N="226" REF="005572_0233_0000000000000000">
<HI>without Works:</HI> And therefore Obedience cannot be included in the Nature of <HI>justifying</HI> Faith, as such; unless Obedience be <HI>without Works</HI> also.&mdash;Here likewise the Expressions are strong and plain. There is no Room for Shift, or Cavil. When all the most plausible Pretences in the World are made to avoid the Force of these Expressions, <HI>without Works,</HI> is <HI>without Works</HI> still.</P>
<P>How admirable does the Pretence, which I am opposing, appear, when the <HI>Apostle</HI> does with his own Pen, in as strong and pointed Language as can be used, obviate the Pretence, reject it, and con|fute it; and that too, in the very <HI>Context,</HI> upon which it is founded.&mdash;I need therefore offer no o|ther Arguments to clear this Point: it is effectu|ally done to my Hand by the Apostle himself: And his Reasoning ought to take Place, against all Objections. Could we be <HI>justified</HI> by any Sort of <HI>Works</HI> or Obedience, personally perform'd by us, we should <HI>have whereof to glory:</HI> And were our <HI>Justification</HI> a <HI>Reward</HI> given on Account of any <HI>Works</HI> of Obedience of ours, it would be of <HI>Debt,</HI> and <HI>not of Grace.</HI> But both these Things are in|consistent with God's gracious Dispensation to|wards us. He <HI>imputeth Righteousness to him that worketh not;</HI> He <HI>justifieth the Ungodly;</HI> He <HI>impu|teth Righteousness without Works:</HI> And therefore the <HI>Faith,</HI> which <HI>is imputed</HI> unto <HI>Righteousness,</HI> does not, cannot, as such, include any Sort of Obedi|ence in the Nature of it.</P>
<P>I proceed now to prove to you, that the <HI>Faith,</HI> which is <HI>imputed</HI> to Believers unto their <HI>Justificati|on,</HI> is not their own personal <HI>Righteousness.</HI> This will evidently appear, if you duly consider these following Arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="005572_0234_0000000000000000">That <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by which a Sinner is <HI>justi|fied,</HI> is <HI>the Righteousness of God.&mdash;The Righteousness of GOD is revealed from Faith to Faith.</HI> Rom. i. 17.&mdash;<HI>We are made the Righteousness of GOD in him.</HI> 2. Cor. v. 21.&mdash;<HI>The Righteousness of GOD, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</HI> Rom. iii. 22.&mdash;Now it cannot be true, that the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> and our own inherent <HI>per|sonal Righteousness,</HI> are the same Thing.&mdash;If it be pretended, that <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Gift</HI> of GOD, and as such it is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of GOD, the Answer is easy. <HI>Faith,</HI> considered in itself, as a Principle, is our's subjectively, and consider'd in its Exercise, it is ours formally, or our own personal Act; and in that Respect, so far as it is any Righteousness at all, it is our own personal Righteousness: And therefore as it is our own personal Righteousness, it can no more properly be said to be the Righte|ousness of <HI>God,</HI> than our Breath can be said to be the Breath of God, our Words to be the Words of God, or our Loco-motion to be the Motion of God.

For if <HI>Faith</HI> cannot with any Propriety be said to be <HI>re|vealed from Faith to Faith;</HI> if we cannot with any Propriety say, that <HI>Faith</HI> is a <HI>Righteousness by Faith of Jesus Christ;</HI> then Faith is not the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> by which we are justified: And therefore we cannot be justified by <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our own inherent personal Righteousness, and yet be justi|fied by <HI>the Righteousness of God.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, we are said to be <HI>made righteous</HI> by <HI>the Obedience of Christ,</HI> Rom. v. 19. and to be jus|tified
<PB N="228" REF="005572_0235_0000000000000000">
by <HI>the Blood of Christ,</HI> Rom. v. 9.&mdash;But <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our personal inherent Righteousness, is in no Respect the <HI>Obedience</HI> of Christ, or the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ: And therefore <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our personal inherent Righteousness, can in no Respect be that <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by which we are justified, or <HI>made righteous before God.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Faith</HI> as it is our personal inherent Righteousness, is <HI>our own:</HI> But the Righteousness by which we are justified, is <HI>not</HI> our own. <HI>Not having my own Righteousness,</HI> Phil. iii. 9. And there|fore, <HI>Faith,</HI> as our personal inherent Righteousness, does not justify us before God.</P>
<P>I will only add, If <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our inherent personal Righteousness, cannot answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law,</HI> it cannot <HI>justify</HI> us, consistently with the <HI>Perfections</HI> of the Divine Nature: but the former is true, and therefore the latter. If <HI>there had been a Law given, which could have given Life, verily Righteousness should have been by the Law,</HI> Gal. 3. 21. But this was impossible in the Case of fallen Man, as being utterly inconsistent with the Divine Perfections.&mdash;I think, no Man will pretend, that our personal inherent Righte|ousness can answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law.</HI> I shall therefore only endeavour to shew you, how it is utterly inconsistent with the <HI>Divine Perfections,</HI> that Sinners should be justified by any <HI>Righteous|ness,</HI> which will not answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be agreeable to the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, that we should be <HI>justified</HI> by any Righteousness, which will not answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law.</HI> For which Reason, <HI>God sending his own Son, in the Likeness of sinful Flesh and for Sin, condemned Sin
<PB N="229" REF="005572_0236_0000000000000000">
in the Flesh, that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</HI> Rom. viii. 3, 4. It is by <HI>decla|ring Christ's Righteousness</HI> (by which the Demands of the <HI>moral Law</HI> are satisfied) <HI>that God can be just, and yet the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</HI> Rom. iii. 26.&mdash;The glorious God <HI>justly</HI> gave us the <HI>Law,</HI> as the Rule of our Obedience; <HI>justly</HI> re|quired our perfect Conformity to it; and <HI>justly</HI> annexed the Penalties to it in Case of Disobedience. This <HI>Law</HI> was founded upon, and flow'd from the <HI>Justice</HI> of the divine Nature. Obedience to it was required, and the Penalties of it were annexed, by the rectoral <HI>Justice</HI> of the great Governor of the World. And the <HI>Justice</HI> of God is now the same that it was when this Law was first given; and with the same inflexible Severity requires, that it be <HI>fulfilled,</HI> and not a Tittle of it <HI>pass away,</HI> or be <HI>destroy'd.</HI> The same <HI>Justice,</HI> which annexed the Penalties, must be satisfied for the Violation of the <HI>Law,</HI> in such Manner as that the Honour of a <HI>righteous</HI> Judge may be secured, and the Penalty of the <HI>Law</HI> fulfilled.&mdash;Whence it follows, that no personal inherent Righteousness of ours whatso|ever can justify us before God, consistent with his rectoral <HI>Justice;</HI> because it cannot answer the De|mands of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI></P>
<P>It is altogether impertinent, to pretend, that CHRIST has procured <HI>easier</HI> Terms, than Obedience to the <HI>Law of Nature.</HI> And that our <HI>sincere</HI> Obe|dience to the <HI>Gospel</HI> is now the Condition of our <HI>Justification.</HI> For the Question still recurs, Which Way is the <HI>moral Law</HI> fulfilled? Has Christ ful|filled <HI>that</HI> for us, and in our Place and Stead; or has he not? If he <HI>has,</HI> we then have a <HI>better</HI> Righteous|ness, to plead for our Justification, than any per|sonal
<PB N="230" REF="005572_0237_0000000000000000">
inherent Righteousness of our own. But if he has <HI>not,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> has still its full Challenges upon us (Penal, as well as Preceptive) notwithstanding any Righteousness of our own, and we cannot be justified upon this Bottom, consistently with the governing <HI>Justice</HI> of God.</P>
<P>I must further observe, it cannot be agreeable to the <HI>Holiness</HI> of God, that Sinners should be jus|tified by any Righteousness whatsoever, which don't fully answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> is (as it were) a Copy or Tran|script of the <HI>Holiness of God;</HI> and must therefore be a perpetual and unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of Righteous|ness to Man. There can strictly be no <HI>Righteous|ness,</HI> but by a compleat Conformity to this <HI>Law:</HI> And hence none can, consistent with God's <HI>Holi|ness,</HI> be accepted by him as <HI>righteous,</HI> who have not a full Conformity to this original and only <HI>Rule</HI> of Righteousness, to plead in their Favour. If therefore, we can have no such perfect Confor|mity to the <HI>moral Law,</HI> to plead before God, on Account of our own personal inherent Righteous|ness, or any other Way, but on the Account of the imputed Righteousness of CHRIST only; then <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our own personal inherent Righte|ousness, cannot justify us, consistently with the rectoral <HI>Holiness</HI> of God.</P>
<P>I may add, it cannot be agreeable to the <HI>Truth</HI> of God, that we should be <HI>justified</HI> by any Righ|teousness, which will not fully answer the Demands of the <HI>moral Law.</HI> God has pronounced every one <HI>cursed,</HI> who <HI>continues not in all Things, written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> If therefore we have not a full Conformity to <HI>all Things written in the Book of the Law,</HI> if we have not a perfect Obedi|ence
<PB N="231" REF="005572_0238_0000000000000000">
to its Precepts, nor a full Satisfaction for the Violation of them, to plead in our Favour, then either we must lie under the <HI>Curse,</HI> or God must break his Word. The latter you dare not suppose: and the former is, in its Nature, absolutely incon|sistent with our <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P>I know of but one Answer, that can with any Colour of Reason be made to these Arguments: And that is, That CHRIST'S fulfilling the <HI>Law</HI> for us is our <HI>Legal</HI> Righteousness; as freeing us from the rigorous Demands; and from the Curses of the <HI>moral Law:</HI> But that our <HI>Faith</HI> including sincere <HI>Obedience</HI> in its Nature, is our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Righte|ousness, whereby we ourselves personally fulfil the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and are hereby <HI>justified</HI> before God. Ac|cording to this Distinction, <HI>Christ's</HI> Righteousness is the Matter or Ground of our <HI>Justification,</HI> taken <HI>Negatively,</HI> as it lies in absolving us from the <HI>Curse of the Law,</HI> and declaring our Sins forgiven: but <HI>our own</HI> Righteousness is the Matter or Ground of our Justification, consider'd <HI>Positively,</HI> as it lies in pronouncing us <HI>Righteous,</HI> and so intitled to <HI>the Blessing.</HI>&mdash;Now the least that can be said against this Notion, is, that it eclipses the Honour of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Lord our Righteousness,</HI> and leaves Man <HI>where|of to glory.</HI>&mdash;But the Consideration of this will of Course bring me to the <HI>last Thing</HI> I proposed in Answer to your Objection,</P>
<P>If your own Construction of those Passages in the <HI>fourth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Romans</HI> were granted; and <HI>Faith,</HI> as including evangelical <HI>Obedience</HI> in it, is <HI>imputed</HI> to us <HI>for Righteousness,</HI> yet this would make nothing against our <HI>Justification</HI> by the <HI>imputed Righ|teousness of</HI> CHRIST. For allowing, that <HI>Faith</HI> be our personal evangelical <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and that as
<PB N="232" REF="005572_0239_0000000000000000">
such it will <HI>justify</HI> us, or render us acceptable to God, as far as it goes, we must yet have CHRIST'S Righteousness <HI>imputed</HI> to us, or else lie under the <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>moral Law,</HI> as I have already proved.</P>
<P>If <HI>Faith,</HI> including sincere Obedience in it, be <HI>imputed</HI> to us for <HI>Righteousness,</HI> this our personal Righteousness must be <HI>imputed</HI> to us, not for what it is not, but for what in Truth it is, that is, an <HI>imperfect Righteousness.</HI> God cannot judge that to be perfect, which is really imperfect. For <HI>his judg|ment</HI> ever is <HI>according to Truth.</HI> And a weak, im|perfect <HI>Faith</HI> (as that of the best is) cannot con|stitute a perfect <HI>Righteousness.</HI>&mdash;Whence it fol|lows, that we cannot on Account of this our per|sonal Righteousness be effectually and thoroughly justified; we cannot be perfectly acquitted from Guilt and Condemnation, we cannot be intitled to compleat Happiness and eternal Life, by Virtue of our own Righteousness: And therefore it is of the last Necessity, that we have some other and better Righteousness, even a perfect one, to plead; or else we must perish eternally.&mdash;At least, we can't at present be <HI>justify'd,</HI> on the Foot of our own Righteousness, so long as we are in this <HI>im|perfect</HI> State: but must wait for <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> as a distant future Benefit, not to be receiv'd till we are made <HI>perfect in Holiness.</HI> Whereas, by the whole Current of Scripture it appears, that <HI>Justi|fication</HI> is a present Benefit, taking Place in <HI>the Life which now is.</HI> Believers have not a meer Promise, that they <HI>shall be justified:</HI> But such are in the most express Terms represented in Scripture as <HI>al|ready justified,</HI> as actually <HI>pardon'd</HI> and <HI>made accept|ed in the Beloved,</HI> as <HI>passed from Death to Life,</HI> and re-instated in God's special Favour, so that <HI>there is
<PB N="233" REF="005572_0240_0000000000000000">
now no Condemnation to them,</HI> but they are now the <HI>Heirs of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you some of the Rea|sons I have against your Author's Interpretation of those Passages in the <HI>fourth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Ro|mans.</HI> Many other Arguments might be added, further to illustrate the Truth; and to refute all Pretences of this Kind. But I am afraid I have been already too tedious; and I hope, what is al|ready said may prove sufficient for your Satis|faction.</P>
<P>You desire me <Q><HI>to give you a brief View of</HI> my Sentiments <HI>of those Passages; and to shew you, in what Sense I understand</HI> Faith <HI>to be</HI> imputed <HI>to us for</HI> Righteousness. You tell me, <HI>that you cannot understand how</HI> Faith's <HI>being imputed to us for Righ|teousness, can intend that</HI> Christ's Righteousness <HI>is imputed to us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The common Interpretation of these Passages by our Protestant Divines, from the Beginning of the Reformation, is, that <HI>Faith</HI> is imputed for Righte|ousness, not <HI>subjectively,</HI> or as it is an Act of our own, and our own personal Righteousness: but <HI>objectively,</HI> or as it hath Respect to its Object, and apprehends the <HI>Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST. That is, as <HI>Faith</HI> is the Band of <HI>Union</HI> between Christ and the Soul, and interests us in him and his justifying Righteousness, it is <HI>imputed to us for Righteousness.</HI> Thus, it is the <HI>Righteousness of Faith,</HI> as Faith is the Term or Mean of our Interest in Christ's Righte|ousness: And yet it is the <HI>Righteousness of Christ,</HI> as He was the immediate Subject and Author of it, or as it was wrought out by him.&mdash;Our <HI>Faith</HI> is in a like Manner said to be <HI>the Faith of Jesus Christ</HI> (Rom. iii. 22.) as <HI>Christ's Righteousness</HI> is here said
<PB N="234" REF="005572_0241_0000000000000000">
to be <HI>the Righteousness of Faith.</HI> Our Faith is not called the <HI>Faith of Christ,</HI> as it is <HI>his</HI> personal <HI>Act,</HI> (Christ does not believe for us) but as it <HI>receives</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, and gives us an <HI>Interest</HI> in him. Nor is our Faith <HI>our Righteousness,</HI> as it is <HI>our</HI> personal <HI>Act</HI> (our Faith has not fulfilled the <HI>Law,</HI> nor answered the Demands of vindictive <HI>Justice</HI>) but it is our Righteousness, as it interests us in what <HI>Christ</HI> has done and suffered <HI>for us,</HI> whereby the <HI>Law</HI> is ful|filled, and <HI>Justice</HI> satisfied.&mdash;In the former Case, the <HI>Object</HI> is put for the <HI>Act:</HI> The <HI>Faith of Christ,</HI> for Believing in <HI>Christ.</HI>&mdash;And there can no Reason be given, why with the same Propriety, in the latter Case, the <HI>Act</HI> may not be put for the <HI>Object;</HI> The <HI>Righteousness of Faith,</HI> for <HI>Righteousness by or through Faith:</HI> and why <HI>Faith</HI> may not be counted for the <HI>Righteousness</HI> obtain'd by believing.&mdash;It is remarkable, that the Apostle expresly speaks of <HI>Faith</HI> in this View, every where else besides this Con|text: And therefore he ought to be here also under|stood in this Sense, to make his Doctrine consistent.&mdash;In this Sense, <HI>Faith</HI> is our justifying Righteous|ness, as a condemned Malefactor's accepting his Prince's Pardon is his Deliverance from Execution: Or as a Beggar's accepting an Alms is his Preser|vative from starving. As in these Cases it is not the <HI>Act</HI> of receiving, but the <HI>Benefit</HI> received, that is the Preservation: So in that Case it is not the <HI>Act</HI> of receiving Christ, but the <HI>Benefit</HI> received by <HI>Faith,</HI> that is the Believer's <HI>Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>But <Q><HI>you can't understand how</HI> Faith's <HI>being im|puted to us for Righteousness can intend that</HI> Christ's Righteousness <HI>is</HI> imputed <HI>to us.</HI></Q>&mdash;Well then, let it be even supposed, that Faith is here taken subjectively; and that it was <HI>Abraham's Faith</HI> itself,
<PB N="235" REF="005572_0242_0000000000000000">
consider'd as an Act of his own, that was <HI>imputed</HI> to him. It may notwithstanding be set in such a View, as will secure the Truth of the Doctrine I am pleading for, if the Text be consider'd as it is in the Original. <HI>His Faith was imputed UNTO Righteousness</HI> ('EIM AIKAIO M YNHN) That is, as he was reckoned, judg'd or esteemed of God to be a sound Believer, so the <HI>Faith</HI> which was imputed or reckoned to him, was <HI>unto Righteousness;</HI> was instrumental to his <HI>attaining of Righteousness;</HI> was the Means that <HI>by the Righteousness of One the free Gift came upon him, unto Justification of Life;</HI> or, in other Words, was the Means of his Interest in that <HI>Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST, by which he was jus|tified.&mdash;In this Sense, the <HI>Imputation</HI> respects his <HI>Faith;</HI> and intends an Approbation and Acknow|ledgement of it as true and sincere, and effectual to its proper Purposes. He was approved of God, as having a true and sound Faith, a Faith effectual, as an applying Means, <HI>unto Righteousness,</HI> and thereby <HI>unto Justification;</HI> a Faith, which interested him in <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>his Righteousness,</HI> and thereby intitled him unto Acceptance with God, and eternal Life.&mdash;He was judged to be such a Believer, as to have a Right according to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, to have <HI>Righteousness imputed to him, with|out Works,</HI> as it's expressed in Ver. 6th.&mdash;Accord|ing to this View of the Case, <HI>Imputation</HI> is consi|der'd in this Context in both the Senses, before ex|plain'd. <HI>Abraham</HI> was reckoned or esteemed a true <HI>Believer:</HI> in Consequence whereof, a justifying <HI>Righ|teousness</HI> was imputed to him, <HI>even the Righteousness of God without the Law.</HI></P>
<P>I think, I have before sufficiently prov'd to you, that we are justified by the Righteousness of Christ
<PB N="236" REF="005572_0243_0000000000000000">
received by Faith, and cannot be justified by any personal inherent Righteousness of our own. This has been illustrated from the Nature of Things, and confirmed by full and plain Scripture-Testimo|ny: And this upon an impartial Search and Inqui|ry, I think, would appear to you to be the whole Scope and Design of the Gospel of Christ.&mdash;I have now remov'd your great Difficulty out of the Way, and shewn you how this Doctrine, so plainly taught every where else, may be true in a full Consistence with those Texts, which in your Apprehension seem'd to make against it.&mdash;I would now propose one Method more, to confirm you in the impor|tant Truth under Consideration: and that, if duly attended to, cannot fail.</P>
<P>Allow me, Sir, the Freedom to advise you, that you place yourself in the Presence of the infinite|ly great and glorious God, and give your self to <HI>Meditation,</HI> on such Subjects particularly as may tend to enlighten and establish you in the present Truth. With this View solemnly contemplate God's infinite Justice, his infinite Purity and Holiness, his infinite Abhorrence of Sin and Sinners, especially as to be seen in the Glass of Christ's Sufferings. Also contemplate your own State and moral Cha|racter, both by Nature and Practice. Contemplate the sinful Defects of the best Works of Righteous|ness that ever you have done, the Pollutions min|gled with the best Duties that ever you perform'd. Contemplate the Unbelief, which accompanied the highest Actings of Faith you were ever capable of; the Formality and Hypocrisy, which has mix|ed with your devoutest Prayers; the desultory Thoughts and dead Frames, which have accompa|nied you to the most sacred Ordinances of God's
<PB N="237" REF="005572_0244_0000000000000000">
House; the frequent Violations of the most so|lemn Resolutions and Covenant-Obligations by which you have bound your Soul to the Lord. And in a Word, Contemplate the Greatness of your Sins, their vast Number and dreadful Aggravations; with the Nothingness of your best Performances and highest Attainments in Religion; how much you have done against God, and how little for him.&mdash;And then consider, what Plea you have to make be|fore this infinitely great, this absolutely just, this per|fectly pure and holy God, for Justification in his Sight, and Acceptance with him.&mdash;Will you plead your Acting of <HI>Faith</HI> in him and his Promises? A|las, how will your prevailing <HI>Unbelief</HI> fly in your Face, and put you to Silence!&mdash;Will you plead your personal <HI>Obedience, and Works of Righteousness,</HI> that you have done? Alas how will a vast De|gree of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> cover and confound you!&mdash;Will you plead your <HI>Sincerity</HI> before God? But what will you do with that prevalent <HI>Formali|ty</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> which your own Conscience will accuse and convince you of!&mdash;Won't you be for|ced at last to cry out with <HI>David, &mdash;If thou, Lord, shouldst mark Iniquity. O Lord, who shall stand!</HI> and with <HI>Job, &mdash;Behold, I am vile! What shall I an|swer thee?

Once have I spoken: but I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</HI>&mdash;Won't you then see your Necessity of a more perfect Righteousness, to plead before God, than any personal inherent Righteousness of your own, to cover your dread|ful Sinfulness and infinite Defects; and to render you acceptable to God, notwithstanding all the Chal|lenges, which the Justice, the Holiness, and the Law of God, together with your own Conscience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. Wherein it is considered, whether we are justifi|ed by Faith and Obedience to the Gospel, as a new Law of Grace.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN with greater Encouragement use my En|deavours to remove your Difficulties; and to satisfy your Desires, since <Q><HI>you don't throw Difficulties, either in your own Way or in mine, out of any conceived Prejudice, or from Ostentation, or wrangling Disposition: But from a sincere De|sire of building your Hope upon the sure Foundation laid in Zion.</HI></Q> Would all Men act from Views so worthy of this great Concern, it would be a like|ly Means, not only to put an End to the prevail|ing Confusions among us: But to give a triumphant

Progress to the Truth; and to establish Men in the <HI>Faith delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>You have</HI> (you say) <HI>been so sensibly affected by my last; and are so fully convinced of the Danger of mistaking your Way, that you are the more solli|citous to be set right; and to have your remaining Difficulties removed: and therefore you intreat me to bear with you, while you propose your strongest Ob|jection against the Doctrine, I suppose to be of so great Importance.&mdash;Your Author</HI> (you say) <HI>tells you, that our blessed Saviour has purchased for us</HI> new <HI>and</HI> easier Conditions <HI>of Life; and instead of the sinless Obedience required by the moral La<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">, he has now given us a</HI> new Law of Grace, <HI>which only requires</HI> Faith, <HI>with</HI> sincere Obedience <HI>to the Gospel, as the</HI> Condition <HI>of our Justification and Acceptance with God.&mdash;Whence it is a necessary Consequence, that our</HI> Justification, <HI>or Title to eter|nal Life, depends not upon</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness imputed to us; but upon</HI> our Faith, <HI>including sincere</HI> Obedience <HI>to the Gospel, as the</HI> Condition <HI>to which it is</HI> promised: <HI>and that as our Obedience is</HI> im|perfect, <HI>so our State of Justification is</HI> imperfect <HI>also; and we shall not be perfectly justified, till our Obedience be perfected.</HI></Q></P>
<P>That I may distinctly consider this Case, I shall endeavour in the first Place, to make some proper <HI>Inquiries</HI> and Reflections upon <HI>this Scheme;</HI> and offer some <HI>Objections</HI> against it; and then take No|tice of the <HI>Arguments</HI> which <HI>you</HI> have brought to support it.</P>
<P>I would first inquire, where you find any Thing in <HI>Scripture</HI> of our <HI>Saviour's purchasing</HI> this new <HI>Law of Grace,</HI> whereby Faith and sincere Obedience are made the <HI>Conditions</HI> of our Justification?&mdash;Perhaps
<PB N="240" REF="005572_0247_0000000000000000">
your <HI>Author</HI> is silent upon that Head: and for my Part, I don't know that I have ever read any Thing at all about it, in the Word of God. We read of|ten, of our blessed Saviour's <HI>giving himself a Ran|som for us;</HI> of his <HI>being a Propitiation for our Sins;</HI> of his being <HI>the Lord our Righteousness;</HI> of his ha|ving <HI>brought in everlasting Righteousness;</HI> of his <HI>be|ing the End of the Law for Righteousness, unto every one that believeth;</HI> and of his <HI>being of God made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption;</HI> with many other like Representations of his procuring a justifying Righteousness for us. But of his <HI>purchasing</HI> this new <HI>Law of Grace,</HI> not one Word is to be found in the Scriptur&eacute;s.&mdash;May we not justly suppose, that if this Scheme were right, we should have it plainly represented to us in the Oracles of God; and not be left to grope in the Dark, and to find out by far-fetcht Consequences, what is the Foundation of our Practice and Hope?&mdash;How vast is the Difference, between the one and the other Side of this Question! On the one Side, we have (or at least we think we have) very numerous, plain, express Scripture-Authorities, for our Justification by the Righteousness of Christ.&mdash;On the other Side, there is a deep Silence through|out the whole Word of God, about any <HI>Purchase</HI> of a <HI>new Law,</HI> such a Law of <HI>favourable Terms;</HI> and about those new <HI>Conditions</HI> of our <HI>Justification,</HI> those easier <HI>Terms,</HI> our Faith and sincere Obedi|ence.&mdash;This Scheme therefore may be presumed to be at best but of human Invention.</P>
<P>I would further inquire, whether in the Nature of <HI>Things</HI> there can be any <HI>Justification</HI> at all, upon such <HI>Conditions</HI> as you speak of?&mdash;I have shewn you, that Justification is always to be understood
<PB N="239" REF="005572_0248_0000000000000000">
of our being esteem'd, declared, manifested, or pronounced <HI>Righteous.</HI> Now then, if our evange|lical Obedience be imperfect, we are still <HI>unrighte|ous,</HI> by our remaining <HI>Sin</HI> and Disobedience against this (imaginary) new Law of Grace; and conse|quently God cannot judge and declare us <HI>righteous</HI> by Virtue of our Obedience. For <HI>his Judgment is according to Truth,</HI> as I observed to you in my last Letter.&mdash;Certain it is, that no Man upon Earth is or can be perfectly sincere, perfectly believing, or perfectly obedient to the Gospel. His Defects will be greater than his Attainments, and his Disobedi|ence will be greater than his Obedience, under his highest Improvements, as long as he lives. He knows nothing of himself, that don't know this to be Fact. He must therefore ever be more <HI>un|righteous,</HI> than <HI>righteous,</HI> as long as he lives: And accordingly He that can make no wrong Judgment of Things, will judge and esteem him to be <HI>as he is:</HI> so that the Man must live and die <HI>unjustified,</HI> and appear at the Bar of Christ in the same State.</P>
<P>To speak of an <HI>imperfect</HI> or <HI>defective</HI> State of <HI>Justification,</HI> seems to be a most egregious Tri|fling in this awful Concern. We either are justi|fied, or we are not: either God does pronounce us righteous, or he does not. Now, if he does, we are free from Guilt, and fully accepted of him; but if he does not, we are under Guilt, and a Sen|tence of Condemnation. There can be no <HI>Medi|um,</HI> no middle State between that of <HI>Justification</HI> and that of <HI>Condemnation.</HI>&mdash;However, were it even granted, that we might be imperfectly justified, in <HI>Proportion</HI> to our Conformity to this supposed new Law, we must at the best live and die <HI>but
<PB N="240" REF="005572_0249_0000000000000000">
imperfectly</HI> justified; and (as I before observed) must appear at the Bar of Christ in the same State in which we die; and consequently be but imper|fectly justified for ever, without some further Re|medy be provided beyond the Grave. Thus, this Doctrine of Justification upon the Foot of personal Obedience to a new Law, is better adapted to a <HI>Popish Purgatory,</HI> than to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Profession and Hope.</P>
<P>I would again inquire, whether it be possible in the Nature of Things, that we may have any <HI>sincere Obedience</HI> to this new Law of Grace, <HI>before</HI> we are <HI>justified;</HI> and consequently whether it is possible that we may be justified <HI>by</HI> sincere Obedience, be|fore we have any Acting of gracious Sincerity, or any true Obedience at all?&mdash;<HI>Faith</HI> indeed does preceed our Justification, in Order of Nature; but not in Time. There is no Moment of Time, wherein a Man is a true Believer, and yet not jus|tified before God: and therefore, there cannot be a Moment of Time for Faith to be operative, and bring forth the Fruits of new Obedience, prior to our Justification.&mdash;<HI>The Righteousness of God is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe; for there is no Difference.</HI> Rom. iii. 22. This is the constant Language of the Scripture, <HI>We are justified by Faith;</HI> and <HI>he that believeth, is not condemned.</HI> Therefore, as there can be no condem|ned, no unjustified Believer, at any Time whatsoe|ver, nor any Time at all for either legal or evan|gelical Obedience between the first Act of Faith and our passing out of a State of Condemnation into a State of <HI>Justification,</HI> hence our sincere O|bedience must be the <HI>Consequence,</HI> and therefore cannot be the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Justification.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="005572_0250_0000000000000000">Besides, as there can be no sincere Obedience <HI>antecedent</HI> to our <HI>Interest in Christ</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> to him, it hence appears that our sincere Obedience must necessarily be the <HI>Consequence</HI> of our Justification; and therefore cannot be the Condition of it.&mdash;I think, every Body will allow that Man to be in a <HI>justified</HI> State, who is interested in Christ, and u|nited to him. Now, our Lord himself assures us, that we cannot bring forth the Fruits of new Obe|dience, till we are united to him. <HI>Job.</HI> xv. 4, 5. <HI>Abide in me, and I in you. As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine: So no more can ye, except ye abide in me. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much Fruit: for without me, ye can do Nothing.</HI> Or, as it may be render'd, <HI>Severed from me ye can bear none,</HI> can bring forth no Fruit at all. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Compare the Original with</HI> Joh. xx. 7. <HI>and</HI> Jam. iii. 12.</NOTE> There can't be a greater Solecism, than to speak of a sincerely o|bedient christless Sinner: and therefore there can't be a greater Inconsistency, than for that to be the Condition of our Justification, which is the Fruit and Effect of our Interest in Christ, and so the Con|sequence of our justified State.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are some of the many Inconveniences, that attend this your Scheme: which one would think should awaken your Attention, and make you look well about you, before you venture your eter|nal Interests upon such an unscriptural and incon|sistent Foundation.</P>
<P>I proceed now to offer some other <HI>Objections</HI> a|gainst the Doctrine you propose.&mdash;And here one obvious Exception against this Doctrine is, that it <HI>perverts the Gospel of the Grace of God,</HI> and makes it
<PB N="242" REF="005572_0251_0000000000000000">
properly and strictly a <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Works.</HI>&mdash;The Condition of the Covenant of Works was this: <HI>The Man that doth these Things, shall live by them.</HI> Rom. x. 5. And the Condition of our Justificati|on, according to this new Scheme is this: <HI>The Man that doth these Things</HI> (i. e. that performs sin|cere Obedience to this new Law of Grace) <HI>shall live by them.</HI> Where then is the Difference, be|tween the old Covenant of Works, and this new im|aginary Law of Grace? What gave Denomina|tion to the Covenant of Works, was, that it re|quired Works or Obedience as the <HI>Condition</HI> of it. And don't this pretended new Law of Grace re|quire Works or Obedience as a Covenant-Conditi|on; and don't it therefore deserve the Denomi|nation of a Covenant of Works, as much as the other?&mdash;If we run a Parallel between the first Co|venant and this imaginary new Law of Grace, they will be found in all Things to agree, as a Covenant of Works. Thus, the <HI>old</HI> Covenant of Works was a <HI>Law</HI> with Sanctions, requiring Obedience, as the Matter of that <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by which Man was to be justify'd. And this <HI>imaginary</HI> new Covenant is likewise stiled a <HI>Law</HI> of Grace, which requires sincere Obedience, as the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Justifica|tion.&mdash;<HI>Justification,</HI> according to the Tenor of the <HI>old</HI> Covenant of Works, was <HI>of Debt:</HI> And thus it is likewise according to the Tenor of this pre|tended <HI>new Law</HI> of Grace. An Obligation to give a Reward for Service perform'd, makes it a <HI>Debt,</HI> upon the Service being perform'd; and it can be claim'd as such, whatever Proportion there is be|tween the Reward, and the Service by which it becomes due.&mdash;The <HI>old</HI> Covenant of Works, when it exacted Obedience, yet gave no <HI>new Strength</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="005572_0252_0000000000000000">
for the Performance of it: And thus it is likewise in the present Case. For unless we are <HI>united</HI> to CHRIST, and interested in his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> we can have no Security of new Supplies of Grace and Strength as we need them. Whatever Pretences to gracious Assistance, the Patrons of this new Law of Grace may make; they don't pretend, that God has by Covenant secured to us fresh Supplies of Grace, for <HI>persevering</HI> Obedience.&mdash;According to the Tenor of the <HI>old</HI> Covenant of Works, <HI>Justi|fication</HI> was suspended, forfeited and lost, upon the <HI>Non-Performance</HI> of the required Obedience: And just thus it is likewise according to the Tenor of this pretended new Law of Grace.&mdash;I must there|fore again demand, wherein this new Law does any Way differ from a proper <HI>Covenant of Works?</HI></P>
<P>If it be pretended, that the <HI>Conditions</HI> of this new Covenant are much <HI>easier</HI> than the Conditions of the old Covenant of Works; which required <HI>per|fect,</HI> and this but <HI>imperfect</HI> Obedience, as the Term of our Acceptance with God: I answer, This Supposal would Nothing alter the general <HI>Nature</HI> of the Covenant. Works are Works, Obedience is Obedience, whether perfect or imperfect. The Condition of each Covenant is <HI>Works;</HI> and Works come into the very formal <HI>Nature</HI> of each, as they are Covenants. And therefore how the one can be either more or less a Covenant of Works, than the other, I know not. Besides, it is a great Mis|take, to suppose, that the Conditions of this ima|ginary new Law or Covenant are <HI>easier,</HI> than the Conditions of the <HI>old</HI> Covenant of Works. The Case is much otherwise. He with whom the first Covenant was made, had sufficient Power and A|bility to fulfil all its Conditions, and fully to come
<PB N="244" REF="005572_0253_0000000000000000">
up to all its Demands. But fallen Creatures are utterly uncapable to perform sincere, though im|perfect, Obedience: they have naturally no Sin|cerity, no Truth in the inward Parts, no Principle of new Obedience; nor does this pretended Co|venant supply them with any, as before observ'd. And therefore whatever Pretences are made, that these Conditions are easier, they are indeed rather <HI>harder</HI> to be be comply'd with, than the Conditions of the first Covenant. It is more difficult for a Man without Legs to <HI>walk,</HI> than for a perfect vi|gorous lively Man to <HI>run.</HI></P>
<P>If it be further pretended, that this Law of Grace differs from the Covenant of Works, in that <HI>Faith</HI> is, according to this Scheme, made the <HI>principal Con|dition</HI> of the new Covenant: This is but an empty Pretence. For <HI>Faith</HI> is here consider'd but as an Act of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and as being seminally or virtually all evangelical Obedience, including the same in the Nature of it; so that this <HI>Faith</HI> is nothing else but a constitutive Part and active Principle of the <HI>Works</HI> required, and not distinct from them in the Office of Justifying. And was not <HI>Adam</HI> as much obliged by the Covenant of Works, to act <HI>Faith</HI> in the conditional Promise of Life, and to subject himself to the Authority of the Legislator, as we can be by this new Law of Grace?&mdash;Let the case therefore be look'd upon in any View, in every View; and this pretended new Law, or Covenant, of mild and favourable Terms, will be found to be as truly a Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> as the first Covenant, made with <HI>Adam.</HI>&mdash;There will indeed appear some <HI>Cir|cumstantial</HI> Differences, between that Covenant and this. For Instance, That Covenant was appointed and enjoin'd by God as a <HI>Sovereign:</HI> Whereas this
<PB N="245" REF="005572_0254_0000000000000000">
(as is pretended) was <HI>purchased</HI> by the Blood of Christ, and is the Law of a <HI>Mediator.</HI>&mdash;That Co|venant admitted <HI>no Renovation,</HI> when violated; But this leaves Room for <HI>Recovery,</HI> upon Condition of Repentance and future Obedience, to such Trans|gressors, as don't happen to die in the sad Interval of Unbelief and Insincerity.&mdash;And that Covenant required <HI>perfect:</HI> This accepts of <HI>imperfect</HI> Obedi|ence.&mdash;But these Things are only Circumstances; and enter not into the Nature of a Covenant-Con|dition. From whatever Inducement God was pleas|ed to propose these Conditions; whatever be the Consequence of their Violation; and whatever De|gree of Obedience be required in Order to our Jus|tification; yet (according to this new Divinity) sincere persevering <HI>Obedience</HI> is the stated <HI>Condition</HI> of each of these Covenants. This, and this only, was what rendered the first Covenant a Covenant of Works: And therefore when all the Pretences are made, that can be made, the second Covenant, upon this Scheme, is as strictly and properly a Co|venant of <HI>Works,</HI> as the first was.</P>
<P>You seem to be aware of this Consequence; and therefore demand of me, <Q><HI>Why it mayn't be sup|posed agreable to the divine Perfections, to require of Man a Life of Obedience now, proportion'd to his</HI> present <HI>Abilities, as the</HI> Condition <HI>of his</HI> Justifica|tion, <HI>as well as to make with him a Covenant of Works at first, proportion'd to his</HI> primitive <HI>Powers and Capacities?</HI></Q> To which I answer,</P>
<P>I have already shewn you, that it is impossible that any Covenant requiring <HI>sincere Obedience,</HI> as the Condition of our <HI>Justification,</HI> can be proportion'd to our present Abilities. For we have no natural Ability for any sincere Obedience at all. <HI>We are
<PB N="246" REF="005572_0255_0000000000000000">
dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> Eph. ii. 1. <HI>The carnal Mind in us is Enmity against God, and is not subject to the Law of God; neither indeed can be.</HI> Rom. viii. 7.&mdash;But this is what I may have further Occasion to inculcate, before I have finish'd this Letter.</P>
<P>I would now only add, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> repre|sent to us an irreconcilable <HI>Opposition,</HI> between our being saved by <HI>Works,</HI> and our being saved by the <HI>Grace</HI> revealed in the Gospel. I have shewn you in my last, how strongly <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> are op|posed to each other, with Respect to our <HI>Justifi|cation.</HI> And I must also observe, that <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> are in like Manner opposed, as irreconcila|bly inconsistent with each other, in this grand Con|cern.&mdash;<HI>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works: otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace: Otherwise Work is no more Work.</HI> Rom. xi. 6.&mdash;<HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith; and that not of your selves, is is the Gift of God. Not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI> Eph. ii. 8, 9.&mdash;<HI>Now to him that worketh, is the Re|ward reckon'd, not of Grace, but of Debt.</HI> Rom. iv. 4.&mdash;Here are the most plain, express and peremp|tory Declarations, that can be made in human Lan|guage, of the utter Inconsistency of <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> the Impossibility of their concurring in the Affair of our Justification and Interest in God's saving Mercy. Whence it plainly appears, that we must be saved by <HI>Grace</HI> alone; or by <HI>Works</HI> alone. And if the former, it must be by the first Covenant of <HI>Works.</HI> But if the latter, then not by any <HI>Works,</HI> by no O|bedience at all, as the <HI>Condition</HI> of our <HI>Justification</HI> and Acceptance with God.</P>
<P>You have indeed undertaken to obviate all such Arguments against your Scheme, by pretending
<PB N="247" REF="005572_0256_0000000000000000">
that <Q><HI>Where</HI> Works <HI>are rejected as having no Hand in our</HI> Justification, <HI>and as being inconsistent with the</HI> Grace <HI>of the Gospel, it must be</HI> legal <HI>Obedience which is there intended; whereas, the Obedience pleaded for, is</HI> Evangelical. <HI>It is not supposed, that we are justified by Obedience to the</HI> moral Law: <HI>but by sincere Obedience to the</HI> Gospel-Institution.</Q></P>
<P>But I intreat you to consider, that if we are indeed <HI>justified</HI> by sincere Obedience to the Gospel, we must be justified by the Works of the <HI>Law,</HI> by Obedience to the <HI>moral Law;</HI> and therefore not by the <HI>Faith</HI> of Christ, as revealed in the Gospel. This appears evident from such Considerations as these.&mdash;The <HI>moral Law</HI> is the very Rule and Standard of all our Obedience to God: if therefore we obtain Justifi|cation by sincere Obedience, we must obtain it by a Conformity to the <HI>moral Law,</HI> without which there can be no Obedience at all, and therefore no sin|cere Obedience. All the Duty and Obedience which we can owe to God as rational Creatures, is comprized in that comprehensive Summary of the <HI>moral Law,</HI> to <HI>love the Lord our God, with all our Heart, Mind and Strength,</HI> and <HI>to love our Neighbour as ourselves:</HI> and there neither is, nor can be any Obedience sincere and acceptable to God, but what flows from this Principle of <HI>Love,</HI> the Source of all practical Conformity to the <HI>moral Law.</HI> Besides, the Gospel <HI>don't make void the Law,</HI> as a Rule of O|bedience; <HI>but establishes it:</HI> And therefore our Justification by sincere Obedience to the Gospel, is a Justification by the <HI>Deeds of the Law,</HI> or by a Conformity to it as the Rule of Life. It is no just Objection against this, that there are some positive Precepts in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which are not discoverable by the Light of Nature, nor directly required by
<PB N="248" REF="005572_0257_0000000000000000">
the <HI>moral Law;</HI> For though these positive Duties, such as receiving Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and Faith in Jesus Christ, the Mediator, consider'd as an Act of Obedience to a Gospel-Command, be not directly required, yet they are by necessary Consequence enjoined in that fundamental Statute of the moral Law, <HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord they God, and him only shalt thou serve.</HI>&mdash;Moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ wrought out the Work of Re|demption for us, <HI>that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</HI> Rom. viii. 4. If therefore he wrought out our Redemption in order to pro|cure <HI>Justification</HI> for us on the <HI>Condition</HI> of sincere Obedience, then our sincere Obedience is a <HI>fulfill|ing the Righteousness of the Law in us:</HI> For it can no other Way be fulfilled <HI>in us,</HI> upon that Suppo|sal. This then, I think is a plain Case, that we must upon this Scheme be justified by the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> by a personal Conformity to it, and by our own <HI>fulfilling the Righteousness of it.</HI>&mdash;Here is no Place for your Distinction of <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>evange|lical</HI> Obedience. All Obedience is <HI>legal,</HI> when per|form'd from legal <HI>Motives</HI> and to a legal <HI>End,</HI> as it is if perform'd in Order to our obtaining <HI>Justifica|tion</HI> and Acceptance with God, upon like <HI>Conditions</HI> with those proposed in the <HI>moral Law;</HI> which I have already shewn to be the Case before us, according to this Scheme of a new Law of Grace.</P>
<P>Here it will therefore be proper to pause a little, and consider whether a <HI>depending</HI> upon such <HI>legal</HI> Obedience for a Claim to God's Favour, can be consistent with our Salvation by the <HI>Faith of Christ,</HI> as revealed in the Gospel.&mdash;The Apostle is full and plain upon this Head. <HI>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law shall no Flesh living be justified in his Sight.
<PB N="249" REF="005572_0258_0000000000000000">
But now the Righteousness without the Law is mani|fest, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.</HI> Rom. iii. 20, 21.&mdash;<HI>Knowing that a Man is not justi|fied by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law: for by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified.</HI> Gal. ii. 16.&mdash;<HI>But Israel which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attain'd to the Law of Righteousness. Where|fore? Because they sought it, not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> Rom. ix. 31, 32.&mdash;<HI>And be found in him, not having mine own Righteous|ness, which is of the Law: But that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</HI> Phil. iii. 9.</P>
<P>But you have another Answer to make to such Texts as these, which are so strongly pointed a|gainst any Dependance upon legal Obedience. <Q><HI>There are some</HI> (you tell me) <HI>who plead, that the legal Obedience, or</HI> the Works of the Law, <HI>which the Apostle opposes to the Grace and Faith of the Go|spel, intends no more, than a Conformity to the</HI> ce|remonial <HI>Law: and in that View of the Case, those Texts of Scripture, wherein such Legality is condem|ned, are no Ways inconsistent with, or opposite to, the Doctrine you are pleading for.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I thought, I had fully obviated this Objection, in one of my former <HI>Letters</HI> to you, wherein I en|deavour'd to set before you the Apostle's Scope and Design in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> especially in the <HI>seventh</HI> Chapter: And if you will review that <HI>Letter</HI> with proper Attention, I think, you will find sufficient Matter of Satisfaction.&mdash;It is strange, that any Man who has ever read that Epistle to the
<PB N="250" REF="005572_0259_0000000000000000">
<HI>Romans,</HI> wherein the Case before us is so distinctly consider'd, can espouse such a trifling Pretence, as this to me most evidently is.&mdash;The Apostle there speaks of a <HI>Law,</HI> by which <HI>the Doers</HI> (supposing there were any) <HI>shall be justified before God</HI> (Chap. ii. 13.) of a <HI>Law,</HI> which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> may (in Part, at least) dis|cover by the <HI>Light of Nature;</HI> and thereby be in some Measure <HI>a Law to themselves.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 14.) But can any Man pretend, that we could be justified be|fore God by an Observance of the <HI>Ceremonial Law?</HI> or that the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> without Revelation, could have understood the <HI>Ceremonial Law,</HI> so as to have been a <HI>Law</HI> to themselves?&mdash;The Apostle is there treat|ing of a <HI>Law,</HI> by which <HI>both Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin;</HI> and by which they had <HI>the Know|ledge of Sin.</HI> (Chap. iii. 9, 20. and vii. 7.) But could the <HI>Gentiles</HI> be under Sin, or have the Know|ledge of Sin, by the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law, which was no Law to <HI>them?</HI> How then could they be capa|ble of any Transgression of it?&mdash;The Apostle there treats of a <HI>Law,</HI> whereby <HI>every Mouth shall be stopped; and all the World become guilty before God:</HI> and a <HI>Law,</HI> which is <HI>established by Faith.</HI> (Chap. iii. 19, 31.) Neither of which, can in any Sense be true of the <HI>ceremonial</HI> Law.&mdash;The Apostle instances in <HI>moral</HI> Precepts, as belonging to the <HI>Law,</HI> which he treats of. (Chap. ii. 21, 22. and vii. 7.) The A|postle exemplifies the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> of which he treats, in the Case of <HI>Abraham</HI> (Chap. iv.) who lived Hundreds of Years before the Exhibition of the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law: and therefore they could not be the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law, that are there opposed to <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;I may add, the Apostle treats of a <HI>Law,</HI> to which the believing <HI>Romans</HI> had <HI>been married</HI> (Chap. vii. 4.) <HI>A Law, the Righteousness of
<PB N="251" REF="005572_0260_0000000000000000">
which must be fulfilled in us.</HI> (Chap. viii. 4.) <HI>A Law,</HI> according to which <HI>the Man that doth these Things, shall live by them.</HI> (Chap. x. 5. Gal. iii. 12.) A <HI>Law, which if the Uncircumcision keep the Righteous|ness of, his Uncircumcision shall be counted for Circum|cision</HI> (Chap. ii. 26.) <HI>A Law which worketh Wrath</HI> (Chap. iv. 15.) And <HI>a Law,</HI> by which <HI>we are under the Curse for Sin.</HI> (Gal. iii. 10.) None of which Cha|racters are properly applicable to the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law.&mdash;Upon the whole then it is evident, even to Demonstration, that it is the <HI>moral Law,</HI> of which he <HI>concludes, that a Man is justified by Faith without the Works of the Law;</HI> that <HI>a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ:</HI> And <HI>if Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.</HI> In a Word, all <HI>Dependance</HI> for <HI>Justification</HI> upon any <HI>Works,</HI> either of the ce|remonial or moral Law, is directly opposite to the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Gospel, and to the Way of Salvation by the <HI>Faith</HI> of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But you tell me, that <Q><HI>if it be allowed to be the Works of the</HI> moral <HI>Law, to which the Apostle re|fers, it must imply an Apprehension and vain Ima|gination of a</HI> perfect <HI>Conformity to that Law.</HI> And that <HI>the Apostle only condemned the Hope of those, who imagined that they had</HI> merited <HI>Salvation, by their perfect Obedience to the moral Law.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This (if possible) is a more trifling Pretence than the former, for which there is not the least Sha|dow of a Foundation.&mdash;The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Judaizing Christians,</HI> knew themselves to be Sinners. They had the Bible, which every where caught them their imperfect and sinful State.&mdash;Their continual expiatory <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> their laying their Sins upon the Head of the <HI>Scape-Goat,</HI> their annual confessing
<PB N="252" REF="005572_0261_0000000000000000">
themselves Sinners on the Day of Atonement, with all their legal Purifications, were continual Monitors to them of the Imperfection of their O|bedience. And as this was the Case of the <HI>Jews,</HI> we may more strongly conclude, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> newly converted from their Devil-Worship, could make no such Pretence.&mdash;So that had the Apostle only disputed against this Pretence, he had only contended with his own Shadow. He condemns our Dependance upon the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Law;</HI> and is not our imperfect Obedience, as truly the <HI>Works</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> as perfect Obedience could be? Can it be supposed, that depending upon <HI>perfect</HI> Obe|dience, which fulfills the Law, will condemn us: but that to depend upon <HI>imperfect</HI> Obedience, which does not fulfil the Law, will not condemn us in the Sight of God!</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I cannot but compassionate the Case of those Men, who by so many artful Shifts and Evasions are putting some Gloss or other upon such numerous clear and plain Texts of Scripture, to make them consistent with their beloved Schemes; and perhaps to keep their Consciences easy, in a Dependance upon their own Obedience for their Justification.&mdash;But I have been too long upon this Head. I must therefore more briefly mention some other just Prejudices against this Scheme.</P>
<P>Another Exception then to this Scheme is, that it is inconsistent with, and <HI>repugnant</HI> to, the vari|ous Representations which the Scriptures give us of the <HI>Redemption</HI> by CHRIST, and of the Method in which our Salvation is wrought out by him.&mdash;<HI>He was made to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 21. <HI>He his own self bare our Sins, in his
<PB N="253" REF="005572_0262_0000000000000000">
own Body on the Tree.</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 24. Now how can it in any Sense whatsoever be possibly true, that our Lord Jesus Christ was <HI>made Sin for us,</HI> un|less it be understood in the <HI>imputative</HI> Sense?

Truth, that we cannot be holy, before we have a Principle of Holiness: that we cannot perform vital Actions, without a Source and Principle of Life.&mdash;It is equally certain, that we naturally have not this Principle of spiritual Life: But <HI>the Imagi|nation of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth, only evil continually.</HI>&mdash;It is also certain, that <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ is contemporary with (though in Order of Nature it flows from and is successive to) the first Princi|ple of spiritual Life; and it is from our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ by Faith, that we derive from him Supplies of Grace and Strength, and that the whole Pro|gress of Holiness is carried on in the Soul.&mdash;It is therefore necessary, that we be first united to Christ the Head of Influences and Fountain of all Holi|ness, and so be habitually <HI>alive to God,</HI> before we can actually <HI>live to God,</HI> as I have observed before.

Do not you know, that the Doctrine which you and your Au|thor plead for, is (substantially) the same with the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine upon the Head of Remission of Sins, and Acceptance with God; and that this very Doctrine was one of the greatest Occasions of our glorious Reformation from <HI>Popery?</HI> Read, Sir, the many elaborate Treatises written by our first Reformers; and you'll find this Doctrine set in its proper Light. You'll find all your Author's Cavils, Shifts, and Evasions justly exposed: all his Arguments distinctly answer'd; and the dangerous Error stript of all that plausible Dress, with which it now again makes its Appearance. You will find, that the Doctrine of <HI>Justification</HI> was esteem'd by all our excellent Reformers, as well as by <HI>Luther, Art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ulus stantis vel cadentis Ecclesiae,</HI> the Article by which the Church must either stand or full.&mdash;And shall we again build up those Things, which that glorious Army of Martyrs destroy'd? Shall we again revive <HI>Popery</HI> in one of its most considera|ble Branches?&mdash;Is not this to open the Door to other <HI>Popish</HI> Delusions and practical Errors, as Pe|riances, Pilgrimages, a monastick Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and other Austerities, to supply the Defects of our sincere Obedience, and patch up a Righteousness

<P>And why must this <HI>Hydra</HI> be digg'd out of its Grave, and revived? What Advantage can be hoped for by this Scheme? Were this Doctrine true, won't sincere Obedience, done from a Prin|ciple of spiritual Life and Holiness, and a Depen|dance upon Christ alone, to do all in us and for us, and to recommend us to the divine Favour, be ac|cepted of God, as well, as if it had been done <HI>in our own Strength,</HI> and with a View to <HI>establish our own Righteousness?</HI>&mdash;Will Christ reject us at last, for doing too much Honour to his infinite Merit, and to the rich and free Grace of God in him?&mdash;What if you should find your Reasoning false and de|ceitful, when it comes to the great Trial?

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Wherein the Notion of a first Justification by Faith, and a secondary Justifica|tion by sincere Obedience, is discuss'd and confuted.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must conclude, I have spent my Time but idly, if I should yet be <Q><HI>unacqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inted with your</HI> Author's <HI>Meaning; and not fully un|derstand, in what Sense he supposes our sincere</HI> Obe|dience <HI>to be the</HI> Condition <HI>of our Justification.</HI></Q>&mdash;It is scarcely possible, that he should with any Ap|pearance of Plausibility offer any Thing new in De|fence of these Principles, or that has not been often advanced, and often refuted, long before either you or I were born.&mdash;And in particular, what you now propose, is but the old <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine-new vampt; which has been repeatedly answer'd by all our old <HI>Protestant</HI> Writers.</P>
<P>You tell me, <Q><HI>Your</HI> Author <HI>acknowledges, that our</HI> first <HI>Iustification is by</HI> Faith <HI>alone, that is, God accepts us as being meet Probationers for Salvation, upon our hearty Assent to the Truth of the Gospel,
<PB N="271" REF="005572_0280_0000000000000000">
and our being heartily willing to take Christ's Yoke upon us, and obey him: And this is the Justification of which the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>speaks, that it is by Faith</HI> without the Works of the Law.&mdash;<HI>But our</HI> secon|dary <HI>Justification, or continued Title to the Favour of God, is by our</HI> Works, <HI>or by a Course of sincere Obedience to the Gospel. Of this the Apostle</HI> James <HI>speaks, when he tells us, that a Man is</HI> justified by Works, <HI>and</HI> not by Faith only.</Q></P>
<P>Sir, You can't be insensible, that this Plea is ut|terly inconsistent with the Evasions <HI>before</HI> offered. We are therefore now to hear no more of your former Distinctions, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> refers to <HI>legal,</HI> and not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vangelical Works,</HI> when he excludes all <HI>Works</HI> from having any Part in our Justificati|on. We are to hear no more of the Apostle's re|ferring to the <HI>ceremonial Law,</HI> when he opposes the Law to <HI>Grace,</HI> and tells us, <HI>that if Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.&mdash;</HI>You now acknowledge, that the <HI>Justification,</HI> of which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks, is by <HI>Faith alone.</HI>&mdash;All other Pleas for the Scheme, which I oppose, must con|sequently be given up; and it must be put upon this single Issue.&mdash;I shall now therefore proceed to consider, whether this Foundation will bear the Weight, which you are putting upon it.</P>
<P>It's worthy of Consideration, that there is No|thing of this new Distinction, of a first and a <HI>secon|dary</HI> Justification, to be found in the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> I look upon it an arbitrary Distinction, coin'd to serve a Purpose, and to help out a tottering Scheme, which could no other Way be supported.&mdash;The Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> it is true, speaks of our <HI>Justification</HI> in one Respect, and the Apostle <HI>James</HI> in another, as I have formerly observed to you: But each of
<PB N="272" REF="005572_0281_0000000000000000">
them retain one invariable View of their Subject, and continue the same Idea of the <HI>Justification</HI> a|bout which they treat. There is not a Word Spo|ken by either of them, of a <HI>first</HI> and <HI>Second,</HI> of an original and additional <HI>Justification.</HI> In|deed the Scriptures know Nothing at all of this Distinction. The Children of God learn Nothing of it from their own Experience. And you must pardon me, Sir, if I must demand some better Foundation of my eternal Hope, than the subtil Inventions of such Men, who would establish and vindicate their Principles by new and, unscrip|tural Doctrines of Religion, which have no Foun|dation at all, but, their own teeming Imagination. This is the common Source of all the Errors, which obtain among us. Men of Learning and Parts, sufficiently apprehensive of their own Capacities, instead of a humble subjecting their Reason to the Wisdom of God in his Word, are first for forming <HI>Schemes,</HI> which appear to them most reasonable; these they take for Principles: And then they must force some Construction or other upon the most opposite Texts of Scripture, and invent some arbitrary Distinctions, to obviate the Difficulties, that lie in their Way.&mdash;This is plainly the Case before us. It does not look reasonable to the <HI>Pa|pists,</HI> to the <HI>Socinians,</HI> to the <HI>Arminians,</HI> and to the <HI>Neonomians,</HI> that our <HI>Obedience</HI> should be wholly <HI>excluded</HI> a Part in our Justification. It is true, the <HI>Scripture</HI> does in Multitudes of Most plain and fa|miliar Expressions, in the most express and strong|est Language, utterly exclude it. But there must be one unnatural <HI>Construction,</HI> or another, forced upon these texts of Scripture, to make them con|sistent with their <HI>Scheme;</HI> which they take for a
<PB N="273" REF="005572_0282_0000000000000000">
<HI>Postulatum,</HI> whatever is said in the Scripture to the contrary.&mdash;When this Refuge fails, the present <HI>Distinction</HI> is coin'd, to support the sinking Cause. It were a sufficient Answer to all these Pretences, to say, <HI>The Foolishness of God is wiser than Men, and the Weakness of God is stronger than Men. And he that seemeth to be wise in this World, let him become a Fool, that he may be wise.</HI></P>
<P>But I have this further Objection against the <HI>Di|stinction</HI> you mention, that it is not only a hu|man Device, without any Appearance of Scrip|ture-Warrant; but is utterly <HI>Inconsistent</HI> with the Scripture-Doctrine of <HI>Justification.</HI>&mdash;There is so much ascribed, in the Scripture, to what they call our <HI>first Justification,</HI> as leaves no possible Room for a <HI>Second.</HI>&mdash;I have observ'd something of this to you, upon another Occasion, in a former Let|ter; and you must bear with me, if you here meet with some Repetition, in Order to set the pre|sent Case in a true and proper Light.&mdash;By Vertue of the Righteousness imputed to us and received thro' Faith, we have a free Pardon of all our Sins. Rom. iv. 5, 6, 7. <HI>To him that worketh not, but be|lieveth on him that justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness. Even as</HI> David <HI>also de|scribeth the Blessedness of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteousness without Works, saying, Blessed are they whose Iniquities are forgiven; and whose Sins are covered. Blessed is the Man, to whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</HI>&mdash;BY Virtue of this Justification we are freed from the Wrath of God, and actually reconciled to him. Rom. v. 9, 10. <HI>Much more then being justified by his Blood, we shall be saved from Wrath through him. For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son: much more
<PB N="274" REF="005572_0283_0000000000000000">
being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</HI>&mdash;By this Justification we are made Righteous in the Sight of God. Rom. v. 18, 19. <HI>By the Righte|ousness of one,</HI> the free Gift came <HI>upon all Men unto Justification of Life. For as by one Man's Disobedience, many were made Sinners; so by the Obedience of One, shall many be made Righteous.</HI>&mdash;By this Justification, we have the Adoption of Children. Joh. i. 12. <HI>As many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe on his Name.</HI>&mdash;By this Justification, we have the Spirit of Adoption, Peace with God, and a joyful Prospect of our eternal Inheritance. Rom. v. 1, 2. <HI>There|fore being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, &mdash;and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God.</HI>&mdash;By this Justification, we are sanctified, and receive needed Supplies of Grace. Heb. x. 10. <HI>By the which Will we are sanctified, through the offering of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all.</HI> Rom. v. 17. <HI>For if by one Man's Offence, Death reigned by one; much more they who receive Abundance of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteousness, shall reign in Life, by one Jesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;By this Jus|tification, we are secured of Perseverance in Grace, against all Charges, Accusations, Persecutions, and malignant Endeavours of Hell and Earth to the contrary. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 33, 35. <HI>Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth.&mdash;Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ? Shall Tribulation, or Distress, or Persecution, or Famine, or Nakedness, or Peril, or Sword?</HI>&mdash;And in a Word, by this Justification, we are intitled to, and shall finally be possessed of, eternal Glory.&mdash;<HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 30. <HI>Whom he justified, them he also glo|rified.</HI>&mdash;And now, Sir, what is there left for your
<PB N="275" REF="005572_0284_0000000000000000">
<HI>secondary</HI> Justification to do? We have God him|self, Pardon, Peace, with all the Benefits, Comforts and Privileges of the Children of God in this Life, and eternal Glory hereafter, bestowed upon us, or made over to us, in Consequence of what you call the <HI>first</HI> Justification. Your <HI>secondary</HI> Justification must therefore be a mere imaginary Thing, an un|accountable Fiction: which hath as little Founda|tion in the Nature of Things, as it has in the Word of God.</P>
<P>I may add to this, that our <HI>Continuance</HI> in a jus|tified State is by the <HI>same</HI> Means, by which we were first justified.&mdash;It is true, Believers (as well as others) are daily sinning, in Thought, Word, and Deed: And there may therefore appear some Dif|ficulty in conceiving, how our once being justified by Faith, can secure to us a Remission of <HI>future</HI> Sins. It cannot be supposed, that our Sins are actually pardoned, before they are committed; or our Guilt cancel'd, before it was contracted. How then can one single Justification stand us in stead, through a future Scene of Sin and Guilt, and in|title us to eternal Glory, notwithstanding a repeat|ed Forfeiture of the divine Favour, and notwith|standing our renewed Deserts of God's Wrath and Displeasure?&mdash;This deserves some particulars Con|sideration. I shall therefore endeavour, in a few Words, to solve this Difficulty, before I proceed distinctly to consider in what Manner our Justifi|cation is continued.</P>
<P>Let it then be observed, that as the <HI>meritorious procuring Cause</HI> of our Justification, with all its Be|nefits, of Grace here and Glory hereafter, was <HI>at once</HI> compleated; <HI>the Body of Christ was offered once for all,</HI> and by his <HI>Obedience unto Death</HI> he brought
<PB N="276" REF="005572_0285_0000000000000000">
in <HI>Everlasting Righteousness:</HI> So the Believer, upon his first being actually interested in the Redemption by Christ, and receiving <HI>his Righteousness,</HI> through <HI>Faith,</HI> is <HI>at once</HI> unalterably acquitted from Con|demnation, re-instated in the paternal Favour of God, and secured in such a continuing Progress of Grace and Holiness, as will end in eternal Glory. For by <HI>one Offering, Christ hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</HI> (Heb. x. xiv.) As our Lord Jesus Christ by <HI>bearing our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, has finished Transgression, made an End of Sin, made Reconciliation for Iniquity, and brought in everlasting Righteousness</HI> (Dan. ix. 24.)&mdash;So by <HI>Faith that is in him, we receive the Forgiveness of Sins, and an Inheritance among them that are Sanctified</HI> (Act. xxvi. 18.) and <HI>are compleat in him.</HI> (Col. ii. 10.) <HI>He</HI> therefore <HI>that believeth, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation: but is passed from Death to Life</HI> (Joh. v. 24.) and is <HI>blessed with all spiritual Blessings, in heavenly Things in Christ.</HI> (Eph. i. 3.)</P>
<P>But this notwithstanding, though our Justifica|tion, as to the meritorious procuring Cause of it, be <HI>at once</HI> perfected and compleated; and by Virtue of the Immutability of God's Counsel, the infinite Merit of the Righteousness imputed, the Stability of the Covenant of Grace, and the Faithfulness of the Promises, the Believer immutably remains a Child of God, and an Heir of eternal Glory: He nevertheless by Reason of his daily Sins and Im|perfections, stands in daily Need of a renewed Application of the Benefits of Christ's Redemption to his Soul, and in daily Need of Pardon and Justification.&mdash;But then it should be remembred, that this is not a <HI>secondary</HI> Justification, <HI>distinct</HI> from
<PB N="277" REF="005572_0286_0000000000000000">
the former<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but the <HI>same</HI> renewed and confirmed. If the Believer <HI>Sins,</HI> he hath an <HI>Advocate</HI> with the Father, to make continual Intercession for him, for renewed Pardon and Grace, and for a Continu|ance of his justified State. <HI>He ever liveth to make Intercession for them; Who needeth not daily as those high Priests, after the Order of</HI> Aaron, <HI>to offer Sa|crifice first for his own Sins, and then for the People's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</HI> Heb. vii. 25, 27.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, the Question now recurs, <HI>By what Means</HI> are Believers <HI>continued</HI> in a justified State? To which I answer as before, by the <HI>Same</HI> Means by which they were <HI>at first</HI> brought into it. <HI>The Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith</HI> (Rom. i. 17.) that is, as a noted Com|mentator expounds these Words, the Beginning, the Continuance, and the Consummation of our Justification, is by <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Now the Just shall live by Faith.</HI> Heb. x. 38. Not only are <HI>the Ungodly justified by Faith;</HI> but <HI>the Just,</HI> or those that are in a justified State, shall <HI>live by Faith,</HI> shall obtain new Supplies of pardoning and sanctifying Grace thro' <HI>Faith.</HI> And thence <HI>the Life which the Believer lives in the Flesh,</HI> is said to be <HI>by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> Gal. ii. 20.</P>
<P>Let any serious Christian consider, what Refuge he can betake himself to, in Order to quiet the Accusations of his Conscience for Sin committed; and to obtain renewed Pardon of his frequent Trans|gressions and constant Imperfections.&mdash;Dare he venture into the Presence of God, and challenge. Pardon on Account of his own sincere <HI>Obedience?</HI> Will he plead before the eternal Majesty, the <HI>milder Terms</HI> of this (imaginary) <HI>new Law of Grace,</HI> and
<PB N="278" REF="005572_0287_0000000000000000">
tell the Almighty, this easy Condition was <HI>purchased</HI> for him by the Blood of Christ, that his own <HI>Works</HI> should <HI>justify</HI> him; that he <HI>sincerely</HI> desires and endeavours to obey God, and therefore pleads the Benefit of that <HI>new Covenant of Works;</HI> and in|treats Pardon and Acceptance, <HI>for</HI> his sincere O|bedience, according to the Tenour of it? If this be an Article of our <HI>Creed,</HI> why should it not be likewise an Article of our <HI>Devotion?</HI> But yet, I think, the Patrons of this Scheme cannot be so hardy, as to plead it before the Throne of God. And I may venture to say, that every sensible hum|ble Christian will use a quite contrary Argument in Prayer for Pardon and Acceptance with God. Such a Man will find no Plea to make at the Throne of Grace, but the infinite Merits of the glorious Redeemer, with the boundless Riches of God's free Mercy in Christ.&mdash;He can find no other Source of continuing Peace and Hope, but a humble Trust and Confidence in the Merit and Righteousness of Christ. He durst not plead his own Attainments before God, not trust in them, as justly recommend|ing and intitling him to his Favour: but repairs by Faith immediately to the Righteousness of Christ alone, for renewed Pardon and Acceptance. Thus you see, that as the Scriptures propose a Way very different from that of our own Obedience, for the Continuance of our Justification, so the Children of God have a quite contrary Refuge for Peace and Pardon; and it would even shock a Christian Ear, to hear any Devotions exactly adjusted and propor|tion'd to these Principles. It is therefore evident, that all Pretences of this Kind should be rejected, by those who would not be finally <HI>ashamed of their Hope.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="005572_0288_0000000000000000">That we may have a further View of the Ab|surdity of this Distinction, let us consider a little how <HI>this Scheme will hang together;</HI> and see whe|ther it won't necessarily destroy it self.</P>
<P>The Patrons of this Distinction do so much Ho|nour to the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which every where attribute our Justification to Faith, as to allow, that our <HI>first</HI> Justification is by <HI>Faith</HI> alone. But what are we understand by that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which this first Justi|fication is obtain'd?&mdash;The <HI>Papists</HI> tell us, that it is an Infusion of a new Principle of Grace and Charity.&mdash;The <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> (at least some of them) teach, that it is the To <HI>credere,</HI> or an Assent to the Gospel-Revelation, which justifies as it is an Act of our own, and an Instance of O|bedience to the divine Command.&mdash;Some of our more modern Refiners upon this Scheme chuse to define this <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we obtain our first Jus|tification, to be a receiving Christ as our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour;</HI> and tell us, that a submitting to his <HI>Go|vernment,</HI> has as great a Hand in our Justification, as our relying upon his <HI>Merit,</HI> or hoping for Salvation on Account of what he has done and suffered for us. I think, all of them agree in this, that Faith justifies as it an <HI>Assent</HI> to the Truth of the Gospel, and an Entrance upon a Life of <HI>Obedience.</HI> None of them suppose this first Justification to be our Acceptance with God, <HI>as Righteous, by the Righ|teousness of Jesus Christ imputed to us, and received by Faith alone.</HI></P>
<P>Now then, what Room is there for this Di|stinction? Is not <HI>Faith,</HI> in this Consideration of it, as much an Act of <HI>Obedience,</HI> as any other Point of Conformity to the divine Command, which we are capable of? And is it not supposed to
<PB N="280" REF="005572_0289_0000000000000000">
<HI>justify</HI> us, as it is our Subjection to the new Law of Grace, and as it is our first Act of Obedience? What then do they mean, by telling us of a <HI>first</HI> Justification by <HI>Faith alone,</HI> and of a <HI>secondary</HI> Jus|tification by <HI>Works;</HI> when they really intend, that the Beginning, the Progress, and the Conclusion of our Justification <HI>is</HI> by <HI>Obedience only!</HI>&mdash;This may easily be brought to a short and determinate Issue. Either <HI>Faith</HI> does justify us as it is a Work of <HI>ours,</HI> and an Act of <HI>Obedience;</HI> or it justifies us as it is the Means of our receiving <HI>Christ's Righteous|ness,</HI> and having the same actually apply'd to us, for our Justification and Acceptance with God.&mdash;There is no other Way, in which we can be sup|posed to be justified by <HI>Faith.</HI> All the Distincti|ons, that the most exuberant Fancies of Men can light upon, are reducible to one of these two.&mdash;Now if the <HI>latter</HI> of these be assumed, the Controversy is ended: We have a Righteousness to plead, that is sufficiently perfect, and that will stand us in Stead; there is no Need of our new Obedience, in Order to make up its Defects, and procure a <HI>secondary</HI> Justification.&mdash;But if the <HI>former</HI> of these be assured, then our <HI>first</HI> Justification is as truly by <HI>Works,</HI> as the <HI>second;</HI> and the whole is by O|bedience <HI>only.</HI>&mdash;How much more fair and ingenu|ous would it therefore be, for the Abettors of these Principles to speak out, and tell us plainly, that we <HI>are justified</HI> only <HI>by Works,</HI> and that <HI>Faith</HI> has no|thing to do in our Justification, but as it is our own Work, and an Act of <HI>Obedience;</HI> than thus to en|deavour to hide the Deformity of their Scheme, as contrary to the whole Tenour of the Gospel, by the Paint and Varnish of this plausible, but groundless <HI>Distinction?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="005572_0290_0000000000000000">If we should proceed to consider the <HI>Nature</HI> of their <HI>secondary Justification,</HI> and the <HI>Obedience</HI> by which it is obtain'd, there will appear to be as little Foundation for this new Distinction from thence, as from the former View. Will every <HI>Act</HI> of our sincere Obedience justify us? Or must it be a <HI>Progress</HI> of Obedience to the End of our Lives? If the former, we have not only a first and second, but a <HI>thousand-fold</HI> Justification. If the latter, we can have <HI>no</HI> Justification at all, so long as we <HI>live;</HI> and have therefore very little Reason to expect it after we are <HI>dead.</HI> For as Death leaves us, Judg|ment will find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s; as I have observ'd to you in an|other Letter.&mdash;Should you suppose, that our <HI>Justi|fication</HI> is <HI>progressive,</HI> and bears Proportion to our <HI>Sanctification,</HI> you must then allow, that we cannot be compleatly justified, till we are compleatly sanc|tified; which we are not to expect in this Life.&mdash;Should you suppose, we shall be justified in our ex|piring Moments, just as we are breathing our last, even this will be before our <HI>Obedience</HI> is finished, or our <HI>Sanctification</HI> perfected: and therefore there can be no more Reason assigned for it, at that Pe|riod, either from Scripture or the Nature of Things, than there could have been perhaps a Thousand Times before.&mdash;So that in whatever View we consider the Case, this <HI>Distinction,</HI> and the whole Scheme founded on it, is a mere Scene of Confu|sion, in the highest Degree repugnant both to Scripture and Reason.</P>
<P>And now I'm ready to attend to <HI>your Reasoning,</HI> in Favour of these Principles.</P>
<P><Q><HI>I must acknowledge</HI> (you say) <HI>that we are jus|tified upon</HI> Covenant-Terms. <HI>Now</HI> a Covenant <HI>must have</HI> Conditions, <HI>to be fulfilled by both Parties:
<PB N="282" REF="005572_0291_0000000000000000">
And consequently the Benefits of the Covenant must depend upon the Performance of those Conditions, and be suspended, when the Conditions are violated. Whence it's necessary to suppose, that there are some continuing</HI> Conditions <HI>required of us, in Order to our compleat Justification.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There is no Need to debate with you the Pro|priety of the Word <HI>[Conditions]</HI> in this Case; be|cause it may be used in a sound Sense. But I know Nothing in the Nature of any <HI>Covenant,</HI> ex|cept a Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> that makes such Con|ditions as you speak of, necessary to it. Whereas, if you consider the <HI>Covenant</HI> of Grace in all the Exhibitions of it, it is a <HI>Covenant of Promise, as</HI> styled <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 12. Thence those who are inter|ested in this <HI>Covenant,</HI> are called <HI>the Children of the Promise.</HI> Rom. ix. 8. And <HI>the Heirs of the Pro|mise.</HI> Heb. vi. 17.&mdash;Thus the Tenor of this Co|venant, when made with <HI>Adam,</HI> was, that <HI>the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpent's Head.</HI> Gen. iii. 15. And thus when made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> it consisted of a Promise, that <HI>in him all the Families of the Earth should be blessed.</HI> Gen. xii. 3. In neither of these Cases, was there any Condition added: it was barely a Declaration of Mercy to guilty Sin|ners. And yet the Apostle expresly calls this a <HI>Covenant, which was confirmed of God in Christ,</HI> and says, <HI>The Inheritance God gave to Abraham by Pro|mise.</HI> Gal. iii. 17, 18.&mdash;And what is there that should make this inconsistent with the Nature of a <HI>Covenant?</HI> Can't you (Sir) <HI>covenant</HI> with a Beg|gar, to bestow upon him what Treasure you please, upon the only Condition of his thankful Accep|tance? Can't a Prince, <HI>Covenant</HI> with his Rebel-Sub|jects, to pardon them and receive them into his
<PB N="283" REF="005572_0292_0000000000000000">
Favour, upon the only Condition of their acknow|ledging his Sovereignty and accepting his Pardon? Would not this be truly and formally a <HI>Covenant;</HI> and a <HI>Covenant</HI> with strongest Obligations to the Performance, especially if confirmed by an Oath, as the glorious God has condescended to confirm the <HI>Covenant</HI> of Grace? Heb. vi. 18.</P>
<P>You further argue, that <Q><HI>good works and a Life of sincere Obedience are absolutely necessary to Sal|vation, without which no Man can see the Lord, and therefore necessary to our Justification, which is but our Title to eternal Life. And a Right or Title to eternal Life is promised to Obedience.</HI> Rev. xxii. 14. <HI>Blessed are they that do his Com|mandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life; and enter in through the Gates into the City.&mdash;Heaven is a Recompence of Reward. And God has particularly promised to his People, that he will proportion the Dispensations of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to the good or evil Behaviour of his People, in the eighteenth and thirty third Chapters of</HI> Ezekiel.</Q></P>
<P>Do you indeed, Sir, suppose, that there is no Difference between <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Sanctification?</HI> They are both, it is true, necessary to Salvation: but are they both necessary in the same Respect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, in the same Place, and Order, and to the same Ends? Are they both necessary, as what equally <HI>intitle</HI> us to the continuing Favour of God, to Grace here and Glory hereafter? Holiness or new Obedience is necessary, as a <HI>Qualification,</HI> disposing or fitting us for the Enjoyment of God, and Possession of the heavenly Glory. But how will it follow from hence, that it is necessary, as the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Recon|ciliation to God, and of our being kept by his Power, through Faith unto Salvation? How will
<PB N="284" REF="005572_0293_0000000000000000">
it follow, that because we can't be saved <HI>without</HI> Holiness, that therefore we must be saved <HI>for it,</HI> and upon the Account of it? It is necessary to an Heir's Possession of an Estate, given him by his Father's <HI>Will,</HI> that he live and enjoy his Reason: Yet it is not his Life and Reason, but his Father's Donation, which gives him the Title. Even so in the present Case, our Life and Activity are ne|cessary to our possessing the eternal Inheritance: But it is the free Grace of God in Christ, which gives us the Title. <HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith, and that not of your selves: it is the Gift of God.</HI> Eph. ii. 8.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> cited by you, they are alto|gether impertinent to your Purpose. You should prove, if you would confirm your Point in View, that we are justified by Works; and that our Works give us the <HI>Title</HI> to Salvation. But all that you do prove by the cited Scriptures is, that good Works are necessary to Salvation; which is a Truth equally allowed by both Parties in the pre|sent Controversy, and a Consequence equally resul|ting from the Principles of both.</P>
<P>The first Text indeed which you quote, does in the English Translation, seem to look something in your Favour. But when read in the Original, all that Appearance is lost. I think, it should thus be read, <HI>Blessed are they who do his Commandments, that they may have Power, Privilege, or Liberty</HI> (EZOYZIA) <HI>for the Tree of Life.</HI>&mdash;And it is on all Hands gran|ted, that none will ever have the Power, Privilege or Liberty, to enter the eternal Inheritance, but those who are sanctified. The whole Question <HI>is, From whence</HI> this Power is derived; upon what <HI>Title</HI> this Liberty or Privilege is founded? Whether
<PB N="285" REF="005572_0294_0000000000000000">
only from the Righteousness of Christ imputed? Or from their sincere Conformity to the (preten|ded) new Law of Grace? To this the <HI>Text</HI> says nothing at all: Nor can any Argument be drawn from it, either on the one or the other Side of the Question.</P>
<P>But <HI>Heaven is a Recompence of Reward.</HI> What then?&mdash;Mayn't a Reward be given, not of <HI>Debt,</HI> but of mere <HI>Grace;</HI> without any Claim by perso|nal Merit, without any Motive from Covenant-Conditions perform'd, or any other Incentive at all, but the mere Goodness and Kindness of the Donor? How then does this prove the Covenant-Conditions, you are pleading for? You may (Sir) if you please, without any previous Covenant, re|ward your Slave's Towardliness, with Freedom and with a good Estate; though this be what he can have no Claim to by his Obedience. His Person and Services being your Property, the Reward must flow wholly from your Kindness and Bounty.&mdash;And thus in the present Case, though eternal Life be a Reward, it is a Reward of mere Bounty and Goodness, it is <HI>the Gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> Rom. vi. 23.</P>
<P>What you urge from the 18th and 33d Chapters of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> is as little to your Purpose. This will evidently appear, if you consider, that these Chap|ters have a special Reference to a <HI>temporal</HI> Salva|tion, from the Calamities that <HI>Israel</HI> either felt or feared from the <HI>Chaldean</HI> War. They were part of them already in Captivity; and the Remainder in dreadful Expectation of the succeeding Carnage and Desolation, which made a swift Approach upon them. They on this Account complain of God's Dispensations as <HI>unequal,</HI> and of their own Misery
<PB N="286" REF="005572_0295_0000000000000000">
as remediless. In Answer to which Complaints, God is pleased by the Prophet to justify his Dis|pensations towards them; and to let them know, that his Dealings with them were according to their own Doings: that their Reformation would avert his Judgments; but their Apostacy and Declension from his Service, would both heighten his Displea|sure, and their Punishment.&mdash;That this was the Design of the 18<HI>th Chapter,</HI> appears evident from the whole foregoing Context; where their dread|ful Destruction by the <HI>Babylonians</HI> was expresly predicted and threatned; which gave Occasion to obviate their Objections against God's Dealings with them, and to give them a just View of the true Source and Cause of their Misery and Ruin. That this was also the Design of the 33<HI>d Chapter,</HI> is most evident from the express Words of the Context, as every one may see, that will read from the 26th to the 29th Verse, where <HI>Sword, Famine, Pestilence,</HI> and utter <HI>Desolation</HI> are expresly denoun|ced, and declared to be the Evils referred to in this Discourse.&mdash;Now what just Argument can be drawn from hence? Will it follow, because God proportions his <HI>providential</HI> dispensations to the external Conduct of his professing Covenant|People, that therefore we are <HI>justified by Works;</HI> or that our eternal Salvation is the immediate Fruit of our own Obedience? Will it follow, that because <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s</HI> threatened <HI>temporal</HI> Destruction was preven|ted by his external Reformation, that therefore he was justified and <HI>eternally</HI> saved upon the Account of it? No, it is plain, that all, Arguments to the present Purpose, from these Chapters, are altoge|ther impertinent. And the Pleas Commonly taken from hence against <HI>Perseverance</HI> in Grace, because
<PB N="287" REF="005572_0296_0000000000000000">
the Righteous are represented as <HI>turning from their Righteousness,</HI> are nothing at all to the Purpose, for which they are used.</P>
<P>But after all, were it even supposed, that these Chapters referred to God's Dispensations toward Men in Relation to their <HI>eternal</HI> State, How would they confirm the <HI>Principles</HI> you are pleading for? They would indeed shew us, that there is a necessary <HI>Connection</HI> between a Life of Obedience and our Salvation, and between a Life of Disobedience and our Perdition, which is a Truth allowed on both Sides of the present Question. But as to the <HI>me|ritorious, procuring,</HI> and <HI>intitling</HI> Cause of our Sal|vation, or the Foundation of our Right and Title to eternal Life, here is nothing spoken in these Chapters. If you would find these Things ex|plain'd by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> read the 36th Chap|ter of his Prophecy, where the Doctrine which you oppose, is strongly asserted, and particularly illustrated. You will there find, it is God that <HI>takes away the Heart of Stone from his People, and gives them a Heart of Flesh;</HI> that <HI>causes them to walk in his Statutes, and keep his Judgments, and do them;</HI> and that it is <HI>not for their Sakes that he does this, but for his own Name's Sake;</HI> and that when this is done for them, they will have Cause to <HI>be asha|med and confounded for their own Ways;</HI> and to <HI>loath themselves in their own Sight, for their Iniquities, and Abominations.</HI> You will there find, that tho' God <HI>will be inquired of by the House of Israel to do this for them:</HI> Yet this is not the <HI>Condition</HI> of their Acceptance, he will bestow his special Grace for <HI>his own Name's Sake,</HI> and <HI>not for their Sakes.</HI>&mdash;Now you will acknowledge, that the other Chapters must be take in the same View with this; and
<PB N="288" REF="005572_0297_0000000000000000">
then though it will appear, that he who repenteth and continueth in Obedience to the End, and none but he, shall obtain Salvation at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: Yet that this Rep&eacute;ntance and new Obedience flows from God's sovereign Grace, and is the Fruit of a justified State.&mdash;The same Thing may be observed concer|ning any other Texts of Scripture, which you can possibly cite, to the like Purpose.&mdash;And I must here observe to you, it is a sure Evidence of the Weak|ness of that Cause, that can be no better defended. There are Multitudes of plain and positive Texts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> which ascribe our <HI>Justification</HI> to <HI>Faith,</HI> and to the <HI>Righteousness of Christ</HI> alone; as I have had Occasion to shew you already. These must be interpreted away at any Rate; because they don't agree with this scheme, which must by all Means be supported.&mdash;But then, what Evidence have we from Scripture for this Doctrine, which is so strenuously contended for? None but this, that <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>New Obedience are necessary to Salvation;</HI> which is just so much (and no more) to the Pur|pose, as if you should attempt to prove your Point from the first Verse in <HI>Genesis.</HI></P>
<P>You proceed to argue, that <Q><HI>Repentance for Sin, which includes new Obedience in the Nature of it, is not only made absolutely necessary to Salvation, but has the Promise of Pardon annexed to it; and is therefore plainly proposed in Scripture, as the</HI> Condi|tion <HI>of our Justification.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is but a Repetition of the former Argument, in other Words. The Question before us is not, what is necessary to our Salvation: but what is the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Justification? It is not the Question, whether Pardon and Salvation be neces|sarily <HI>connected</HI> to Repentance and new Obedience:
<PB N="289" REF="005572_0298_0000000000000000">
but what it is that gives us a <HI>Title</HI> to this Pardon and Salvation; and whence it is, that this Repen|tance and new Obedience flows, by which we are qualified to partake of saving Benefits.&mdash;The Scrip|tures assure us, that this is the <HI>Righteousness of Christ</HI> received by Faith; and what you now offer, is no Ways inconsistent with the many Declarati|ons of this Kind, throughout the whole Word of God.&mdash;If it were granted, that whatever are the <HI>Requisites</HI> in them that shall be saved, and whatever Qualifications have the <HI>Promise</HI> of Pardon and Sal|vation annexed to them, are the <HI>Conditions</HI> of our Justification, it would then follow that <HI>Perseverance</HI> is a Condition of our Justification; and conse|quently all Dispute about being justified in this <HI>pre|sent Life,</HI> is at an End, as I have observed before. For the Benefit is suspended, 'till the Condition on which it depends, is accomplished.&mdash;Besides, I think, all Men must allow, that if <HI>Repentance</HI> be the Fruit and Consequence of our <HI>Justification,</HI> if cannot be the Condition of it. There can be no|thing more preposterous, than to suppose an Effect to be a Condition of the Cause producing it. And the Scriptures assure us, that Repentance is the Fruit and Consequence of our Justification. Thus is it particularly represented to us. Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 28, 31. <HI>A new Heart also will I give you; and a new Spirit will I put within you;&mdash;And ye shall be my People; and I will he your God&mdash;Then shall ye remem|ber your own evil Ways, and your Doings that were not good; and shall loathe your selves in your own Sight, for your Iniquities and for your Abominations.</HI> Thus likewise, Zech. xii. 10. <HI>And I will pour out upon the House of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and of Supplications;
<PB N="290" REF="005572_0299_0000000000000000">
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, and shall be in Bitterness for him, as one that is in Bitterness for his first-born.</HI>&mdash;In which Texts you see, there is first <HI>a new Heart and a new Spirit;</HI> they are first in a justified State, <HI>they are God's People, and he is their God;</HI> they are first re|newed and have a <HI>Spirit of Grace and Supplication;</HI> they have first the Exercise of Faith, <HI>they look upon him whom they have pierced:</HI>And then follows their Repentance, as an immediate and necessary Con|sequence of their regenerate justified State.&mdash;This Truth is most evident, not only from the Scripture|Representation of this Matter; but also from the Nature of a true and sincere Repentance.&mdash;We must be united to Christ and have a Principle of Life, before we can perform vital Actions.&mdash;We must have the Dispostions of our Souls renewed, before we can hate Sin, and heartily mourn after a Deliverance from what is naturally pleasant and delightful to us. We must first have Faith in Christ's Blood, before we can repair to it for Cleansing from Pollution and Guilt.&mdash;We must first have a Princi|ple of Love to Holiness, before we can live a Life of new Obedience.&mdash;The legal Terrors, Resolu|tions and Endeavours, which preceed our Justifica|tion, are very far short of a true Repentance; and therefore can have no Promise of Pardon and Sal|vation made to them.&mdash;It is therefore evident, that tho' an evangelical Repentance do's immediate|ly succeed (and in its Beginnings is even conten|porary with) a true justifying Faith: Yet it is in Order of Nature an Effect and Fruit of it; and consequently cannot be the Condition of our Jus|tification.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="005572_0300_0000000000000000">And now I proceed to the Consideration of your last Argument, for the Vindication of these Prin|ciples. <Q><HI>It seems</HI> (you say) <HI>that our Obedience must be the Condition of our Justification, because the Process of the</HI> final Judgment <HI>will be put upon that Issue; and every Man will be judged in that awful Day</HI> according to his Works.</Q></P>
<P>To which I answer, that I can see no Manner of Consequence in this Reasoning, because God of his infinite Grace and Bounty will be ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|sed to reward the Obedience of Believers at the <HI>eternal Judgment,</HI> that therefore our Obedience is the Condition of our <HI>present Justification.</HI> You your self (Sir) have been so good to the young Gentleman, your Sister's Son, as to take him out of Prison, to pay his Debts, to adopt him into your Family, to call him by your own Name, and to treat him as your own Child: And I am told, that you intend to reward his Dutifulness to you, by giving him the Preference to your Daughters, and by making him the Heir of your solid Estate.

No, Sir, you know that this was an Act of more Compassion and Kindness.&mdash;Apply this to the Case before us; and you will see the Fate of your Argument.&mdash;You are besides to consider, that it is no where said in Scripture, that we are at the last Day to be rewarded <HI>for</HI> our good Works, but according to them.

Life, Christ is considered in the special Character of our <HI>Redeemer,</HI> our Propitiation, and High Priest; and accordingly applies the Benefits of his Re|demption to our Souls, that we may be accepted in him: But in the great Day of <HI>Accounts,</HI> he will appear in the special Character of our <HI>Judge,</HI> publickly owning and rewarding those Graces, which he has enabled us to exercise, and that Obe|dience which he has excited and strengthened us to perform.&mdash;In our <HI>Justification</HI> here, he is glori|fying the Riches of his redeeming <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Love:</HI> In the Day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> he will glorify his recto|ral Holiness and Equity, as well as his infinite Boun|ty; and let the intelligent World see, that <HI>the Judge of all the Earth will do right.</HI>&mdash;Here, he <HI>justifies the Ungodly,</HI> by acquitting them from Guilt, and impu|ting Righteousness without Works: there, he will reward the Godly, by crowning their Piety and Ho|liness with eternal Life.&mdash;Here, our <HI>Justification</HI> is the Foundation and Fountain of our new Obedi|ence; as I have before shewn you: there, we are to receive the Reward of our Obedience already perform'd and finished&mdash;In our <HI>Justification</HI> here, Christ acts from the Motives only of his sovereign Grace and Love: in the final Sentence, he will proceed according to the Rules of distributive re|munerative <HI>Justice,</HI> in adjusting and proportioning Rewards.&mdash;So that from the Nature of Things it is agreeable, that we should here be <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Faith only:</HI> but there judged according to our <HI>Works.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. Wherein the Apo|stle JAMES'S Doctrine of <HI>Justificati|on by Works,</HI> in his second Chapter, is distinctly review'd, and set in its genuine Light, by a Comparison with the Apostle PAUL'S Doctrine of Justification by Faith.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU <Q><HI>acknowledge, that if it were not for one Difficulty in your Way, you should think the Evidence offered against the Doctrine you have proposed, must be conclusive: But you don't know
<PB N="295" REF="005572_0304_0000000000000000">
how to give into a Scheme, that is not only expresly contradicted, but particularly refuted, in the Word of God.&mdash;The Apostle</HI> Paul (you say) <HI>does indeed seem to speak in Favour of my Principles: but he ought to be interpreted by the Apostle</HI> James, <HI>who expresly rejects my Interpretation of St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Dis|courses on the Subject before us.&mdash;What Appearance therefore soever there may be, in Favour of my Prin|ciples, in St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Epistles, these must not be un|derstood in direct Contradiction to the express Decla|rations of</HI> another <HI>inspired Writer.</HI>&mdash;You <HI>therefore desire me to shew, how it is possible to reconcile my Scheme with the Doctrine of St.</HI> James, <HI>in the second Chapter of his Epistle, from the fourteenth Verse to the End.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If this be all your remaining Difficulty, I hope, it won't prove an hard Matter to give you full Sa|tisfaction, that the Doctrine of the Apostle <HI>James</HI> in the Place refer'd to, is no Ways inconsistent with the Doctrine of our <HI>Justification by Faith.</HI> so plainly and fully taught by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in all his Epistles; and therefore, that our <HI>Justifica|tion by Works</HI> (in the Sense that I oppose it) has no Foundation at all in the whole Word of God.</P>
<P>That this may be set in a proper Light, there are two or three Things necessary to be premised, and distinctly consider'd, previous to a direct and im|mediate View of the Consistency and Concurrence of these two Apostles, in the Doctrine of a Sin|ner's <HI>Justification by Faith,</HI> notwithstanding their seeming Disagreement and Repugnancy.</P>
<P>It should first be premised, that these <HI>two Apos|tles</HI> must be understood in such a Sense, as will make them <HI>consistent.</HI> We must take this for a Principle, that whatever becomes of our Schemes, on one
<PB N="296" REF="005572_0305_0000000000000000">
Side or the other, the Spirit of God cannot be inconsistent with himself, nor teach contrary Doc|trines.&mdash;That Interpretation therefore must be right, which will make them consistent; and that must be rejected, which sets them at Variance, and makes their Doctrines utterly irreconcilable.</P>
<P>It should be likewise premised, that the Apostle <HI>James</HI> must be understood in such a Sense, as will make him <HI>consistent</HI> with <HI>himself.</HI> We may not sup|pose, that he teaches such a Doctrine in this Part of the second Chapter, as is repugnant to the Doc|trine which he himself teaches elsewhere, in the same Epistle.&mdash;Let us then see if we can't find the Doctrine I am pleading for, taught in this very E|pistle of <HI>James.</HI> Particularly in Chap. i. <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 5, 6, 7. <HI>If any of you lack Wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in</HI> Faith, <HI>nothing wavering. For he that wavereth, is like a Wave of the Sea, driven of the Wind, and tossed. For let not that Man think, that he shall receive any Thing of the Lord.</HI> From whence I argue, If <HI>Faith</HI> be the Way to divine Acceptance and Audience of our Prayers, the Means by which our Duties will find a gracious Reception with God, and without which they will be rejected; then we are <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> and not by <HI>Works.</HI> For it is undoubted|ly true, that what justifies our Obedience, and ren|ders that acceptable to God, does likewise justify our Persons, and render them acceptable to him. And our <HI>Works</HI> can have no Hand in justifying our Persons, if our Works themselves are justified by <HI>Faith;</HI> but condemned and rejected without it, as the Apostle teaches us in the cited Text. So we learn from Chap. v. 15, 16. that <HI>the effectual fer|vent
<PB N="297" REF="005572_0306_0000000000000000">
Prayer of the righteous Man</HI> is <HI>the Prayer of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, If spiritual <HI>Wisdom,</HI> or practical Ho|liness, be the Fruit and Effect of <HI>Faith</HI> (as we are told that it is, in the quoted Text) then our Justi|fication and Acceptance with God (by which we do, and without which we cannot obtain the divine Influences to our progressive Sanctification) is by <HI>Faith,</HI> and not by <HI>Works.</HI> I think, no Man will pretend, that we are so acceptable to God, as to obtain his sanctifying Influences, in a Progress of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and Grace, <HI>before</HI> we are justified: or that we are <HI>sanctified by Faith,</HI> and <HI>justified by Works.</HI> Whence it follows, that <HI>Faith</HI> is the Mean or Term of our Justification, because it is the Mean or Term of our Sanctification; and that a holy Life can|not be the Condition of our Acceptance with God, because it is the Consequence and Fruit of that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we find Acceptance with him.</P>
<P>Another Text to the same Purpose, we find, in Chap. ii. 5. <HI>Hearken, my beloved Brethren, hath not God chosen the Poor of this World, rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which God hath promised to them that love him?</HI>&mdash;It might be read, <HI>Hath not God chosen the Poor</HI>&mdash;to be <HI>Rich</HI> (as a similar Phrase is translated <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 29.) to be rich <HI>with</HI> or <HI>by Faith, and Heirs.</HI>&mdash;Does it not plainly teach us, as that the End of God's chusing the <HI>Poor,</HI> was that they might be spiritually <HI>Rich,</HI> so that it is <HI>Faith</HI> which <HI>en|riches</HI> them, and constitutes them <HI>Heirs</HI> of the King|dom? And you will readily own, that if we are Heirs of the Kingdom by <HI>Faith,</HI> we are justified by <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;The Kingdom is prepared for them that <HI>love God:</HI> And <HI>Faith</HI> is the Source of that Love to God, by which we are qualified for the King|dom. <HI>Faith worketh by Love,</HI> Gal. v. 6. And there|fore

<HI>Faith</HI> is the Term or Medium of our Accep|tance with God and Title to the Kingdom.&mdash;These Texts must therefore be remembred, in our Expli|cation of the Context you refer to, that we may not represent the Apostle as teaching Contradictions or Inconsistencies.</P>
<P>It must also be premised, that we should under|stand the Reasonings and Conclusions of the two Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> according to the <HI>professed Scope</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of their Discourses, and according to the <HI>Subject</HI> they are professedly treating upon: And we should consider the Expressions they each of them use upon the Point in View, not as Words occasionally and transiently spoken; but as what relate to, and are connected with the <HI>Subject-Mat|ter</HI> professedly undertaken to be explain'd.&mdash;This must be always allow'd to be a natural and rational Rule, which ought to be strictly adhered to, in the Interpretation of Scripture.&mdash;Now then, let us look a little into this Case; and see if we don't find the Scope and Design of these two Apostles very <HI>different,</HI> where they speak so very different|ly of Justification by <HI>Faith,</HI> and by <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> designedly handles this Question, How a <HI>guilty, condemned</HI> and <HI>convinced Sinner</HI> shall get reconciled to God, find Acceptance with him, and have a Title to the heavenly Inheritance?&mdash;He treats of such <HI>who are under Sin, whose Mouths must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> stopped, who are all become guilty bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e God; and who have all sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</HI> Rom. iii. 9, 19, 23.

Guilt. This is the plain and manifest Scope of the two first and Part of the third Chapters to the <HI>Romans.</HI> He thence proceeds to shew which Way, and which only, they may hope for Acceptance with God; in the remaining Part of the third, and in the following Chapters of that Epistle. This cannot be by the Deeds of the Law. <HI>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, shall no Flesh he justified in his Sight.</HI> Chap. iii. 20. But it must be <HI>by the Righ|teousness of God without the Law, by the Righteous|ness of God without the Law, by the Righteous|ness of God by Faith of Jesus Christ;</HI> and <HI>by Faith without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 21, 22, 28.&mdash;This is the Subject, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> keeps con|stantly in View, in his Epistles to the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Galatians.</HI></P>
<P>But then on the contrary, the Apostle <HI>James</HI> designedly handles this Question, Whether <HI>careless licentious Professors</HI> of Christianity may presume upon their obtaining Salvation, from their doctrinal Faith, or from their notional and historical Assent to the Truth of the Gospel? And thence he takes Oc|casion distinctly to consider, which Way a Chri|stian's <HI>Faith</HI> may be justified, his <HI>Profession</HI> vindi|cated and evidenced to be sincere and true. He discourses of <HI>a Man that faith he hath Faith, and hath not Works,</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 14.) of one that hath a <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Charity,</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 15, 16.) of <HI>a Faith that hath not Works, but is dead being alone,</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 17.) a <HI>Faith,</HI> that is but like <HI>a Body without Spirit,</HI> or a Carcase without Breath, (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 26.)</P>
<P>These are the respective Questions handled by these two Apostles; and their <HI>Answers</HI> are adap|ted to the Subjects professedly handled by them. They give the very same Answers to each of these Questions, that a judicious <HI>Calvinist</HI>-Divine would
<PB N="300" REF="005572_0309_0000000000000000">
now give.&mdash;Should an <HI>awakened Sinner,</HI> under a Sense of his Guilt and Danger, inquire of one of our Divines, how he may obtain a Pardon of his Sins, a Reconciliation to God, and a Title to eter|nal Life, would he not answer, with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> that he must <HI>seek Righteousness by Faith, and not as it were by the Works of the Law:</HI> for <HI>by the Deeds of the Law, no Flesh shall be justified in his Sight:</HI> that he must <HI>be found in Christ, not having his own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</HI>&mdash;But then, on the other Hand, should any vain Professor, that turns the <HI>Grace of God into wantonness,</HI> yet <HI>say that he has Faith,</HI> and flatter himself with Salvation, from his historical or doctrinal Belief of the Gospel, while living a careless and sensual Life; would he not be told in the Language of the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> that such a <HI>Faith won't save him;</HI> that the <HI>very Devils have such a Faith,</HI> as well as he; that <HI>Faith with|out Works is a dead Faith,</HI> and but a <HI>Carcase without Breath;</HI> that he must have <HI>Works</HI> to justify his Pretence to Faith; and must <HI>shew his Faith by his Works,</HI> or his Hopes are vain, and he <HI>a vain Man</HI> to entertain such Hopes.&mdash;Now, what Shadow of Disagreement would appear in these different An|swers, to such very different Subjects in Question?</P>
<P>After this View of the Case, it is now to be con|sider'd, from which of these Apostles we may ex|pect to have the Doctrine of a Sinner's <HI>Justifica|tion</HI> before God explain'd and set in its proper Light: whether from him who is purposely hand|ling this Subject; or from him who is not purposely handling this Matter, but treating on a very different Subject? This is an Inquiry verily easily answer|ed
<PB N="301" REF="005572_0310_0000000000000000">
and being answered, the whole Difficulty van|ishes of Course.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, I proceed to consider the <HI>Subject</HI> before us more directly and particularly: And by taking Notice of the Doc|trines respectively taught by these Apostles, shall endeavour to shew you, that there is <HI>no Disagree|ment</HI> at all between them; nor any Thing at all in this Discourse of the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> which you refer to, that is in the least repugnant to our <HI>Jus|tification by Faith,</HI> without <HI>Works of Righteousness</HI> done by us.</P>
<P>This will appear evident, if we consider in the first Place, that these Apostles are treating of a different <HI>Faith.</HI> The one of them has not the same Idea, and does not mean the same Thing with the other, when they discourse of <HI>Faith</HI> and its Influ|ence upon our Justification.&mdash;You remember, I have formerly shewn you at large, in a Letter pur|posely written on that Subject, that there are two Sorts of <HI>Faith</HI> mention'd and described in the Scrip|ture. By the one we are, and by the other we are not, justified before God. Now the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of the former of these; and the A|postle <HI>James</HI> of the latter. There is therefore the greatest Truth and Propriety in what each of these <HI>Apostles</HI> speak of <HI>Faith,</HI> taking it in the Notion which they respectively intend. 'Tis true, that by the <HI>Faith</HI> of God's Elect we are justified and saved: 'Tis also true, that the <HI>Faith</HI> of the vain Man, or empty Professor, a bare notional historical fruitless <HI>Faith,</HI> will not save us.&mdash;The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of a <HI>living Faith, by which the Just shall live.</HI> (Rom. i. 17.) The Apostle <HI>James</HI> speaks of a <HI>dead Faith,</HI> which is but as a <HI>Body without the
<PB N="302" REF="005572_0311_0000000000000000">
Spirit.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 17, 26.&mdash;The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of a <HI>Faith which worketh by Love.</HI> (Gal. v. 6.) The Apostle <HI>James</HI> speaks of a <HI>Faith which hath not Works;</HI> and which is destitute of <HI>Mercy</HI> or <HI>Cha|rity.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 16, 17.&mdash;<HI>Paul</HI> treats of a special <HI>Faith,</HI> by which <HI>we are the Children of God.</HI> (Gal. iii. 26.) <HI>James</HI> of a <HI>Faith,</HI> which is common to the <HI>Devils.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 19.&mdash;<HI>Paul</HI> treats of a <HI>Faith,</HI> by which <HI>we shall be saved.</HI> (Rom. x. 9.) <HI>James</HI> of a <HI>Faith,</HI> which <HI>cannot save us.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 14.&mdash;<HI>Paul</HI> treats of a <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we are <HI>justified, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> (Rom. iii. 28.) <HI>James,</HI> on the contrary, speaks of a <HI>Faith,</HI> which <HI>being alone, without Works,</HI> is such as will <HI>not</HI> justify us. <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 24.&mdash;Now can it possibly be true of the same <HI>Faith,</HI> that it is both alive, and dead; that it worketh by Love, and yet hath not Works, but is without Love and Mercy; that by it we are the Children of God, and yet not distinguished from the Devil by it; that we are saved by it, and not saved by it; that we are justified by it without Works, and are not justified by this alone, without Works? If these are not some of the highest Contradictions, I know not what in the World either is or can be so. The Consequence therefore is inevitable, either that these contrary Characters and Accounts of Faith cannot be both true; or else that it is a different <HI>Faith,</HI> which these Apostles speak of. You dare not assume the former of these Consequences; and therefore must allow the latter to be necessa|rily true. You must allow it to be true, that <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of one Kind of <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>James</HI> of ano|ther.&mdash;And what Argument can now be fairly drawn from this Discourse of the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> but this only, that a lifeless, fruitless, unoperative <HI>Faith</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="005572_0312_0000000000000000">
won't justify or save us? And who, but sensual Libertines, ever thought that it would?&mdash;If you suppose <HI>James</HI> to be here speaking of a true lively <HI>Faith,</HI> you must suppose him to contradict, not only the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> but our blessed Lord himself, and the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> in Multitudes of plain and express Passages of Scripture, which are every where dis|persed through the Bible, that ascribe our <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> before God to <HI>Faith</HI> only. Here then the Controversy is brought to a Point. And what Conclusion will you now come into? Is it not Time to give up your Scheme, and ingenuously ac|knowledge, that as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> is here saying nothing to the Subject before us, there can nothing be inferred from what he says, against the Doctrine which you oppose.</P>
<P>It is also further evident, that the Apostle <HI>James</HI> in the Context referred to, is saying Nothing con|trary to the Doctrine so constantly taught by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> of our being <HI>justified</HI> before God by <HI>Faith</HI> alone, <HI>without the Deeds of the Law,</HI> nor any Thing in Favour of our <HI>Justification</HI> before God by our own <HI>Works;</HI> This, I say, is further evi|dent, because he is not there treating of <HI>Justifica|tion,</HI> as it's the Relief of a guilty World, and im|ports the Acceptance of our Persons before God; nor is he saying any Thing at all about this, one Way or another. But he is treating of the <HI>Justi|fication</HI> of our <HI>Faith,</HI> or Demonstration of the Sin|cerity of our <HI>Profession</HI> by its proper Evidences: Which <HI>Justification,</HI> he shews us, is by <HI>Works.</HI>&mdash;Whereas the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is always treating only of <HI>Justification</HI> as it is the Relief of an awakened Sinner, and imports the Acceptance of our Persons, when he tells us that we are <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Faith, with|out
<PB N="304" REF="005572_0313_0000000000000000">
Works.</HI>&mdash;I have formerly shewn you, that tho the Word <HI>Justification</HI> (in its general Notion) has always one unvaried Meaning and uniform Signi|fication in Scripture, yet it is frequently apply'd in both these Respects. It is indeed most usually to be understood for the Acceptation of our Per|sons with God, and respects our Interest in his Fa|vour: but it sometimes also intends a Vindication of our Character as Believers, and such a Manifes|tation of the Sincerity of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Profession,</HI> by the necessary practical Evidences, as will give them a just Estimation and Acceptance with our own Consciences, or with our Fellow-Creatures. Thus the Word is used, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxv. 1. <HI>Job</HI> xxxiii. 32. <HI>Luke</HI> vii. 35. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 4. and elsewhere. And I am now to shew you, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> un|derstands the Word in the former of these Senses; but the Apostle <HI>James</HI> in the latter.</P>
<P>By <HI>Justification,</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> intends <HI>the Re|mission of Sins.</HI> Rom. iii. 25. <HI>Our receiving the Gift of Righteousness,</HI> Rom. v. 17. And our being <HI>in|titled</HI> thereby to Grace here, and Glory hereafter. <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 1, 2.</P>
<P>But by <HI>Justification,</HI> the Apostle <HI>James</HI> intends no more than the approving our selves found Be|lievers, evidencing the Sincerity of our <HI>Faith,</HI> or manifesting the Truth of our Profession, and so the Safety of our State.&mdash;If this appears to be so, upon a particular Examination of the Case, you must own, that there is no Place for any Argument in Favour of your Scheme, from this Context.&mdash;Let us then consider this Matter distinctly and impartially.</P>
<P>It may be presumed, that the Apostle <HI>James</HI> is not treating of the <HI>Justification</HI> of our Per|sons
<PB N="305" REF="005572_0314_0000000000000000">
in the Sight of God, in that there is not one Character of such <HI>Justification,</HI> to be seen in his whole Discourse. There is nothing spo|ken about our obtaining Pardon of Sin, nothing of our Persons being made righteous in the Sight of God, nothing of our being intitled to future Glory, by the <HI>Works</HI> unto which our <HI>Justification</HI> is ascribed. No more can therefore be proved from this Apostle, but that we are in some Respect <HI>jus|tified by Works:</HI> Yet not so justified, as to obtain Remission of Sins and Reconciliation to God, or to be intitled to an Inheritance in the future Glory, by our <HI>Works.</HI> For of these Things, or of any Thing else which implies them, he says Nothing at all.&mdash;But this may be more fully and clearly evinced, by the following Considerations.</P>
<P>It is evident in the first Place, from the <HI>Occasion</HI> of this Discourse, as it is represented to us in the first sixteen Verses of this Chapter. They pro|fessed <HI>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory,</HI> and yet <HI>had Respect of Persons;</HI> making a Criminal Distinction between the <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor,</HI> of the same Christian Faith and Profession with themselves; as appears from the four first Verses of the Chapter. They <HI>despised the Poor;</HI> and thereby violated that <HI>royal Law, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself.</HI> ver. 6, 8. <HI>They respected Persons,</HI> they <HI>committed Sin, and were convinced of the Law as Transgressors.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 9. They exposed themselves to <HI>have Judgment without Mercy,</HI> if they thus <HI>shewed no Mercy.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 13.&mdash;And would such as these pretend to <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ? <HI>What doth it profit, if a Man say, that he hath Faith, but hath not Works? Can that Faith save him?</HI> What Profit can that <HI>Faith</HI> be to them, which leaves them so uncharitable and
<PB N="306" REF="005572_0315_0000000000000000">
unmerciful, that they can see <HI>a Brother or Sister na|ked, or destitute of daily Food,</HI> and only <HI>say to them, Depart in Peace, be you warmed and filled: but not withstanding, they give them not those Things which are needful to the Body.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 14, 15, 16.&mdash;This is plainly the Occasion of this Discourse. They pre|tended to Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ: but bro't forth Fruit quite contrary to their Pretensions.&mdash;How then could they justify their Pretensions? How could they <HI>justify</HI> their Profession of <HI>Faith,</HI> against the Charge of Hypocrisy, and prove it to be sincere and saving? They could never in this Sense be <HI>justified</HI> any Way, but in that of <HI>Evidence</HI> by a Life correspondent to their Profession. Their <HI>Faith</HI> must be justified or evidenced by their <HI>Works.</HI> I may allude to that, <HI>Isai.</HI> xliii. 9, <HI>Let them bring forth their Witnesses, that they may be justified.</HI> O|therwise let them pretend what they would to <HI>Faith,</HI> while they lived without <HI>brotherly Love</HI> and <HI>good Works,</HI> it was but an empty Pretence; and their Profession wanted the proper <HI>Witnesses to justify it.</HI> Thus the Argument is natural and easy: and the Conclusion necessarily follows.&mdash;But then, on the other Hand, if we consider <HI>Justification</HI> as meaning our Reconciliation to God, and our personal Ac|ceptance with him; the Apostle's Argument will appear very lame and defective, and the Conclu|sion will never follow from the Premises. For it will by no Means follow, because a lifeless fruit|less <HI>Faith,</HI> destitute of Mercy and Obedience to the royal Law of Love, will <HI>not justify</HI> us before God; that therefore <HI>good Works</HI> in Truth <HI>will jus|fy</HI> us before God. It will by no Means follow, be|cause we <HI>can't</HI> be accepted of God and saved, by a false and unsincere Profession of <HI>Faith;</HI> that
<PB N="307" REF="005572_0316_0000000000000000">
therefore we <HI>can</HI> be accepted of God and saved, by such <HI>Obedience</HI> as we are capable to perform.&mdash;The Inference is therefore necessary, that the A|postle must be so understood, as will secure the Connection of his Discourse, and the Force of his Argument: Which cannot be done, if we con|sider him as speaking of <HI>Justification</HI> in any other Sense, than that which I am now pleading for.</P>
<P>Further, that the <HI>Justification</HI> here treated of, is the <HI>Justification</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> and Sincerity, but not of our Persons, is evident likewise from the <HI>Consequence,</HI> the Apostle draws from the foregoing Premises, which he undertakes to prove and vindicate in the following Verses: Which is, <HI>Even so Faith, if it hath not Works, is dead being alone.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 17. This is the Point, which he undertakes to prove: And accordingly this is the Conclusion of the whole, when he has finish|ed his Reasoning on the Subject. <HI>For as the Body without the Spirit is dead, so Faith without Works, is dead also.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 26. As a breathless spiritless Corpse that cannot act or move, is evidently dead, so a speculative Belief, that does not influence a Man's Life and Actions, is evidently dead; a dead Thing in it self, argues a dead Soul, and is dead as to the Purposes and Offices of Gospel-Faith.&mdash;We must therefore understand all the Arguments here used, to refer to this Point only. They are all brought to prove, that <HI>Faith which is without</HI> [or severed from) <HI>Works, is dead:</HI> And that therefore there is a Necessity of <HI>Works</HI> to <HI>justify</HI> our <HI>Faith,</HI> or to make it manifest that it is not a <HI>dead Faith.</HI> Were <HI>Justification</HI> here taken in the other Sense, his Arguments would not only be utterly in|conclusive: but his Reasoning quite foreign to
<PB N="308" REF="005572_0317_0000000000000000">
to his Subject, which may not be supposed: And therefore it necessarily is the <HI>Justification</HI> of our <HI>Faith,</HI> or Christian Profession, and not of our Per|sons, which the Apostle <HI>James</HI> is here treating of.</P>
<P>This is also evident from every one of the Ar|guments, used by the Apostle in this Context.&mdash;Every one of them will bring out the Conclusion now mention'd: But neither of them separately consider'd, nor all of them connected, have any Appearance of an Argument in Proof of our per|sonal <HI>Justification</HI> (or our Persons being made righ|teous) before God, by our good <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> Argument seems but <HI>ironically</HI> propo|sed. <HI>Yea, a Man may say, Thou hast Faith, and I have Works: Shew me thy Faith, without thy Works; and I will shew thee my Faith by my Works.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 18) As if he should have said: Have you indeed <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Works!</HI> I pray, shew me your <HI>Faith</HI> with|out <HI>Works,</HI> if you can. For my Part, I know of no such Way of manifesting the Truth of <HI>Faith;</HI> I resolve to take a contrary Method; and <HI>will shew you my Faith,</HI> will evidence the Sincerity of it, and <HI>justify</HI> my Profession of Faith, <HI>by my Works.</HI> Here the Argument is very clear and full, in Favour of the Interpretation I am pleading for. And here we have an <HI>Index,</HI> to point out the Meaning of the Word <HI>Justification,</HI> in the subsequent Discourse. It can't import more than a <HI>manifestative</HI> Justifica|tion. Indeed it signifies the same Thing with <HI>shew|ing our Faith,</HI> or evidencing the Truth of our Pro|fession, and so of our justified State.&mdash;But now let us see how this Argument will conclude for the other Side of the Question. The Argument ought to be thus stated. Our <HI>Faith</HI> must be shewn and manifested by our <HI>Works:</HI> therefore our <HI>good Works</HI>
<PB N="309" REF="005572_0318_0000000000000000">
will <HI>justify</HI> our Persons before God, and render us righteous and acceptable in his Sight.&mdash;I think, every Body will own, that the Spirit of God don't reason at that Rate; and therefore that <HI>Justifica|tion before God,</HI> which is the Sinner's Relief against the Challenges of his Law and Justice, cannot be the Subject here treated of.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> Argument here used, is, that a fruit|less and unoperative <HI>Faith,</HI> though it be good as far as it goes, yet is no other than what the <HI>Devils</HI> have; she is therefore a <HI>vain Man,</HI> who depends upon Acceptance with God by such a dead <HI>Faith. Thou believest there is one God; thou dost well; the Devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works, is dead.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 19, 20.&mdash;Here the Apostle expresly shews us, what it is he had undertaken to prove: Which is, that a bare, fruitless, historical <HI>Faith</HI> cannot save us, be|cause it is common to the very <HI>Devils.</HI>&mdash;Here he expresly shews, who it is he is disputing with: it a <HI>vain Man,</HI> who vainly expects to be saved by an idle <HI>Faith,</HI> and empty Profession of the Gospel, without any Fruit of Obedience.&mdash;And here he does again expresly assert the Principle, which was the Subject of his Discourse, and the only Point to be proved, that <HI>Faith without Works, is dead.</HI>&mdash;So that there is no Room to debate, what was the Design of this Argument. By this he effectually proves, that the <HI>Faith</HI> which <HI>justifies</HI> our Persons, must be <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>good Works;</HI> otherwise we are but <HI>vain Men,</HI> and our Hope is but a <HI>vain Hope,</HI> which will leave us among unpardon'd <HI>Devils</HI> at last.&mdash;But not so much as the least Colour of an Argument can be found here, that our <HI>Persons</HI> are <HI>justified</HI> before God by good <HI>Works:</HI> Whence
<PB N="310" REF="005572_0319_0000000000000000">
follows, that the <HI>Justification</HI> here treated of, must necessarily be the <HI>Justification</HI> of our Faith, of our Christian Character and Profession; and not of our Persons, in Regard of their State, before God.</P>
<P>A <HI>third</HI> Argument here brought by the Apostle to prove his Point, is <HI>Abraham's being justified by Works, when he had offerred</HI> Isaac <HI>his Son upon the Altar.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 21.&mdash;Now it appears from a Variety of the strongest and clearest Evidences, that the Apo|stle did not (could not) refer to the <HI>Justification of</HI> Abraham's <HI>Person</HI> in the Sight of God, but to the <HI>Justification</HI> of his <HI>Faith</HI> and Sincerity only, in this Instance before us.</P>
<P>This appears, in the first Place, because <HI>Abraham</HI> was in a <HI>justified State,</HI> by an everlasting <HI>Covenant,</HI> thirty Years before his offering his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> upon the Altar. It was so long, or near so long before this, that the glorious God himself made the Pro|mise to him, in Gen. xvii. 7. <HI>And I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a GOD unto thee and to thy Seed after thee.</HI>&mdash;And it was more than so long before this, that <HI>A|braham</HI> had this Testimony given him in Gen. xv. 6. <HI>That he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for Righteousness.</HI> Yea, he was a Believer so long before, as his first leaving his Father's House. <HI>By Faith</HI> Abraham, <HI>when he was called, &mdash;obeyed and went out.</HI> Heb. xi. 8. How then could his offer|ing his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> be the Mean or Term of the Justification of his <HI>Person</HI> before God, when he had <HI>Faith</HI> unseigned, had <HI>Righteousness imputed to him,</HI> and an <HI>everlasting Covenant</HI> made with him so long a Time before?&mdash;Besides, if <HI>Works</HI> could have <HI>justified</HI> his <HI>Person,</HI> he would have been <HI>justified</HI> by
<PB N="311" REF="005572_0320_0000000000000000">
<HI>Works</HI> long before this. For his whole Story shews, that he had lived in a Course of holy fruit|ful Obedience, from the Time of his <HI>Justification</HI> till this Time.&mdash;There can't therefore be any fair Pretence made, that the <HI>Justification</HI> of his <HI>Person</HI> is here referred to. No, this good Work was not in the least <HI>constitutive,</HI> but only <HI>evidential,</HI> of his Personal <HI>Justification</HI> before God.</P>
<P>Further, it appears by the <HI>Story</HI> it self, to which the Apostle refers, that it was only a manifestative <HI>Justification,</HI> a <HI>Justification</HI> of his <HI>Faith</HI> and Since|rity, and so declarative of the justified State of his Person, that <HI>Abraham</HI> obtain'd by offering his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> upon the Altar.&mdash;The glorious God conde|scends to treat with him after the Manner of Men; and by an Assumption of human Affections, to de|clare concerning him, <HI>Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not with-held thy Son, thine only Son, from me.</HI> Gen. xxii. 12. This then was the <HI>Justification,</HI> of which the Apostle treats, <HI>Abraham's</HI> making it <HI>known, that he feared God,</HI> and that his <HI>Faith</HI> and Profession were sincere.&mdash;For this is all the <HI>Justification,</HI> which can be prov'd from this Text in <HI>Genesis,</HI> to which he refers.&mdash;We may not sup|pose, that an inspired Apostle quoted Scripture impertinently: And yet we cannot suppose the Scripture referred to, was any Thing at all to his Purpose, unless we understand him to be speaking of <HI>Justification</HI> in the Sense I am pleading for. In this Sense therefore, and this only, did the Apostle design to prove our <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Works,</HI> by the Argument now before us. <HI>Abraham's</HI> Obedience witnessed to the Truth of his <HI>Faith:</HI> And so his real State of <HI>Justification</HI> before God was made apparent.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="005572_0321_0000000000000000">This also appears by the Apostle's <HI>Illustration</HI> of this Argument, in <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 22. <HI>Seest thou how Faith wro't with his Works, and by Works was Faith made per|fect?</HI>&mdash;How was it that <HI>Faith wrought with his Works?</HI> Not as a Joint-Condition of his Justifi|cation before God. He was <HI>justified</HI> in the Sight of God long before this, as I have shewn you al|ready: And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> assures us, that his <HI>Justification</HI> was <HI>by Faith, without Works,</HI> Rom. iv. 4, 5. Therefore <HI>Faith</HI> could not co-operate with his <HI>Works,</HI> to the <HI>Justification</HI> of his <HI>Person,</HI> when <HI>Righteousness was imputed to him that worked not, but believed on him that justifieth the Ungodly.</HI> This Sense being rejected and contradicted by the Spirit of God himself, must consequently by no Means be admitted: Nor is there any other Interpretation, which can (with the least Shew of Reason) be given to these Words, but that which I am pleading for. Agreeably we read, <HI>Heb. 11. 17. By Faith</HI> Abra|ham <HI>when he was tried, offered up</HI> Issac: <HI>and he that had received the Promises, offered up his only begotten Son.</HI> His <HI>Faith</HI> was signally operative; not a <HI>dead Faith;</HI> and therefore sincere. This was visibly demonstrated by the good <HI>Works,</HI> which it produ|ced, <HI>Such Works</HI> must be the Productions of a true and lively <HI>Faith.</HI> And we may see in this Instance, how <HI>Faith wrought with his Works,</HI> exciting, direct|ing, assisting him in them: And thereby may see, that it was not such a <HI>Faith,</HI> as the Apostle is here complaining of.&mdash;<HI>By Works was his Faith made perfect.</HI> How was it <HI>made perfect?</HI> The Grace of <HI>Faith,</HI> consider'd in it self, was neither the better nor the worse, neither more nor less <HI>perfect,</HI> for the <HI>Works</HI> which followed it: Save, as the Exercise of <HI>Faith</HI> in doing them might tend to strengthen
<PB N="313" REF="005572_0322_0000000000000000">
and improve the Habit. But the Meaning seems to be, that it was discover'd, and proved to be a <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">fect</HI> (true and lively) <HI>Faith,</HI> by its practical Con|sequences and Effects.&mdash;His <HI>Faith</HI> was a <HI>perfect</HI> or sincere <HI>Faith,</HI> when it was <HI>imputed to him for Righ|teousness,</HI> thirty Years before this. But this noble Act of Obedience evidenc'd the Truth of his <HI>Faith,</HI> justify'd his Profession and Character, witnessed to his being a true Believer; and made it <HI>known, that he</HI> indeed <HI>feared God, seeing he with-held not his Son, his only Son, from him.</HI>&mdash;In this View of the Case, the Argument is clear and pertinent; and the Evidence full and convincing: but consider'd according to the other Construction of the Words, it affords no Conclusion to the Purpose. It is no Consequence, that because <HI>Abraham's Faith</HI> was <HI>operative,</HI> therefore his good <HI>Works</HI> made him righ|teous, or had any Hand in the <HI>Justification</HI> of his Person before God: Or, that because his <HI>good Works</HI> were an Evidence that his <HI>Faith</HI> was <HI>perfect</HI> and upright, therefore his <HI>good Works</HI> were a Con|dition of his <HI>Justification</HI> in the Sight of God, with Respect to his Person and State.</P>
<P>The same Thing likewise appears from the 23d Verse. <HI>And the Scripture was fulfilled, which faith,</HI> Abraham <HI>believed God; and it was imputed to him for Righteousness: And he was called the Friend of God.</HI>&mdash;There can be Nothing more pertinent, na|tural and easy, than the Application of these Words to the Purpose which I have proposed. That eminent Instance of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Obedience did most convincingly evidence the Truth and Sincerity of his <HI>Faith;</HI> and abundantly verify the Report in the Scripture, that <HI>Abraham did believe God;</HI> and that he had indeed such a <HI>Faith,</HI> as was the Means
<PB N="314" REF="005572_0323_0000000000000000">
rendering him <HI>righteous</HI> and accepted with God.&mdash;Thus the <HI>Scripture</HI> was <HI>fulfilled,</HI> and clearly mani|fested to be true.&mdash;But then on the other Hand, if <HI>Justification</HI> be consider'd in the Sense which you plead for, this Argument would be so far from con|cluding in Favour of the Point to be proved, that it would be directly opposite and contradictory to it. For how could <HI>Abraham's</HI> being <HI>justified by Works, fulfil the Scripture, which faith,</HI> he was <HI>jus|tified by Faith;</HI> if <HI>Justification</HI> be in both Places taken in the same Sense, for absolute <HI>Justification</HI> of the <HI>Person</HI> before God? How could his <HI>Works</HI> being <HI>imputed for Righteousness,</HI> fulfil that <HI>Scripture</HI> which assures us that <HI>his Faith was imputed for Righteousness;</HI> unless <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> are the same Thing, and there be no Difference at all between believing and obeying?&mdash;Certain it is, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> understood the Argument to conclude the quite contrary Way, when he undertook to prove from this very Text, that <HI>Righteousness is imputed to him that worketh not;</HI> and that it <HI>is im|puted without Works:</HI> And therefore the Apostle <HI>James</HI> must be understood in such a Sense, as will make both his Argument conclusive, and his Doc|trine consistent with the other inspired Writings.&mdash;I shall only add, as to that Clause, <HI>And he was called the Friend of God,</HI> this does not mean, that <HI>Abraham's</HI> Works <HI>made</HI> him <HI>the Friend of God:</HI> But they <HI>de|clar'd</HI> him so. His Obedience did not put him in the <HI>State</HI> of a <HI>Friend:</HI> but being upon Trial found faithful, he obtained this <HI>Testimony,</HI> that he was <HI>the Friend of God,</HI> a justify'd Believer.&mdash;Now <HI>Abraham</HI> being the <HI>Father of all them that believe,</HI> an eminent Example of Faith, and Pattern of Justification, the Apostle subjoins (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 24.) <HI>You see then how that by Works
<PB N="315" REF="005572_0324_0000000000000000">
a Man is justified, and not by Faith only.</HI>&mdash;In a like Sense, even as Christ is said to be <HI>justified in</HI> [or by] <HI>the Spirit,</HI> so a Christian Man is <HI>justify'd</HI> by the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit,</HI> in a holy Life, <HI>i. e.</HI> declar'd <HI>ap|proved of God. By Works</HI> a Man that says he has Faith, is thus <HI>justified,</HI> and <HI>not by Faith only;</HI> not by a <HI>Faith that hath not Works</HI> attending it; not by a <HI>Faith which is alone,</HI> or <HI>by it self,</HI> destitute of its proper Fruits and Evidences. Some of the best Criticks in the <HI>Greek</HI> Language tell us, the exclusive Particle MONON (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 24.) as here placed <HI>after</HI> the Word <HI>Faith,</HI> has the Force of an <HI>Adjective;</HI> and they read it, <HI>Fide solitaria,</HI> Faith which is <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> Argument is taken from the Instance of <HI>Rahab,</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 25. <HI>Likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by Works, when she had received the Messengers, and had sent them out another Way?</HI>&mdash;Upon which the same Remarks may be made, as on the Instance of <HI>Abraham.&mdash;Rahab</HI> feared the God of Israel, and was a true Believer, and there|fore personally <HI>justified</HI> in the Sight of God, be|fore her <HI>sending out the Spies another Way.</HI> For she had <HI>received the Spies by Faith.</HI> (Heb. xi. 31.) And consequently she certainly had <HI>Faith,</HI> before she received them. A noble <HI>Confession</HI> whereof we find her making to these <HI>Spies,</HI> before she dis|missed them. See Josh. ii. 10, 11. What <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> therefore could she possibly obtain by these <HI>Works,</HI> but the <HI>Justification</HI> of her <HI>Faith,</HI> since she was really in a justified State before?</P>
<P>And now I am come to the <HI>Conclusion</HI> of this whole Dissertation, which is, <HI>For as the Body with|out</HI> [or severed from] <HI>the Spirit is dead, so Faith without</HI> [or severed from] <HI>Works is dead also.</HI> <ABBR>v</ABBR>. 26. This, as I observed before, clearly shews what was
<PB N="316" REF="005572_0325_0000000000000000">
the Apostle's Design in his whole Discourse. For every Conclusion of an Argument justly prosecuted, must be naturally deduced from the Premises, and consist of the principal Subject-Matter to be proved, as we see is the Case before us. But if <HI>Justification</HI> were here taken in the Sense which you espouse, the Arguments would all of them be inconclusive: And that Conclusion would be quite foreign to the Purpose.&mdash;This Consequence therefore of my fore|going Discourse necessarily forces itself upon you, that the Apostle was not here treating of the <HI>Jus|tification</HI> of our <HI>Persons</HI> before God, in Regard to their State; but of our <HI>Faith,</HI> in Point of Since|rity: And therefore there can no Argument be brought from this Context, for our <HI>Justification</HI> by Works, in the Sense you plead for.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you have seen, that the Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> were treating of very <HI>different Subjects,</HI> and their Determinations were adapted to the Doctrines, which they undertook to explain. And thence it is a just Inference made by an eminent Divine upon this Subject, that <Q>the principal Designs of the two Apostles being so distant, there is no Repugnancy in their Assertions, tho' their Words make an Appearance thereof. For they do not speak <HI>ad idem;</HI> nor of Things <HI>eodem Respectu. James</HI> doth not once inquire, <HI>How</HI> a guilty convinced <HI>Sinner,</HI> cast and condemned by the <HI>Law,</HI> should be <HI>justified before God?</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> speaks to nothing else. Wherefore apply the Expressions of each of them to their proper Design and Scope, (as we must do, or we depart from all sober Rules of Interpretation, and make it impossible to understand either of them aright,) and there is no Disagreement, or Appearance of it between them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="005572_0326_0000000000000000">And it may be yet further remark'd that these Apostles had very <HI>different Persons</HI> to deal with, in their respective Epistles: And their Addresses were accordingly accommodated to the State of the Parties to whom they wrote.&mdash;The Apostle <HI>Paul's</HI> Busi|ness either lay with such, who being newly con|verted from <HI>Heathenism,</HI> were biassed by the Prin|ciples taught by the Light of Nature, and always received by them, to indulge the vain Thought, that they must render themselves acceptable to God, and be justified in his Sight, by their own personal Righteousness and Obedience to the Law. An Opinion greatly strengthned by the numerous false Teachers, who were <HI>desirous to be Teachers of the Law, though they understood neither what they said, nor whereof they affirm'd.</HI> Or else his Business lay with <HI>Judaizing</HI> Christians, who being zealous of the Levitical Dispensation and Constitution, expected <HI>Justification</HI> by their Conformity to it.&mdash;Of these Sorts of Professors the Apostle observes, that <HI>they were soon removed, from him that called them into the Grace of Christ, unto another Gospel.</HI> Gal. i. 6. And that <HI>being ignorant of God's Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, they had not submitted themselves unto the Righteousness of God.</HI> Rom. x. 3. His Concern was therefore to dis|cover their dangerous and destructive Mistake; and to represent to them the Way, the true and only Way, in which they might hope for <HI>Justifica|tion</HI> in the Sight of God. That it is <HI>not by Works of Righteousness which they had done, but of God's Mercy,</HI> they must be <HI>saved;</HI> that they must be <HI>justified freely by God's Grace, through the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus;</HI> and that in the <HI>Justification</HI> of a Sinner, <HI>Righteousness is imputed without Works,</HI> and received by Faith only.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="005572_0327_0000000000000000">On the contrary, <HI>James</HI> being concern'd with carnal Professors of Christianity, who perverted the Doctrines of <HI>Grace</HI> to encourage themselves in a careless licentious Life, does at large convince them of the Necessity of <HI>Holiness,</HI> as the Fruit and Evi|dence of a true and saving <HI>Faith,</HI> and the Means to qualify them for the Kingdom of Heaven.&mdash;He therefore puts them upon examining into the Truth of their <HI>Faith,</HI> and Foundation of their Hope, and shews them by the Arguments already consi|der'd, what alone will <HI>justify</HI> their Profession of <HI>Faith,</HI> and give 'em good Grounds to conclude the Safety of their State.</P>
<P>They therefore who over-magnify <HI>Works,</HI> and depend upon 'em as the Condition of their <HI>Justifi|cation</HI> before God, are admonished by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to consider, that they are building upon the Sand, and that they must renounce their false Con|fidence, or perish. <HI>For by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified:</HI> And <HI>if Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</HI> Gal. ii. 16, 27. This solemn Truth does indeed (Sir) call for your earnest Attention.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, They who depreciate <HI>good Works,</HI> and neglect them as no Consequence to eternal Salvation, are called upon by the Apostle <HI>James</HI> to consider, how empty their Profession, how dead their <HI>Faith,</HI> and how vain their Hope of Sal|vation is. For if Men may go to Heaven without <HI>Holiness,</HI> why may'nt the <HI>Devils</HI> go there too, who have <HI>Faith</HI> (such as it is) as well as they? We must have a living <HI>Faith,</HI> or a dead <HI>Hope.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> must purify our Hearts, and renew our Conversa|tions; or leave us among the impure and ungodly for ever. It concerns <HI>every one</HI> therefore, <HI>so to speak
<PB N="319" REF="005572_0328_0000000000000000">
and so to do, as they that shall be judged by the Law of Liberty.</HI> (Jam. ii. 12.)</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, as you are taught by the one Apostle how dangerous it is to build upon any other Foundation, than Christ only; for <HI>Christ Jesus is our Hope,</HI> and <HI>other Foundation can no Man lay, than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus:</HI> so are you ad|monished by the other Apostle, that you can have no Interest in Christ nor Title to his Salvation, but by a <HI>Faith</HI> which purifies the Heart, works by Love, and is <HI>justified</HI> by a subsequent Life of Holiness and new Obedience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Extreams,</HI> on both Sides of the Question, are equally dangerous. He that joins <HI>good Works</HI> with <HI>Faith,</HI> as equally the Terms of <HI>Justification</HI> before God, virtually rejects the Saviour's Sufficiency; substitutes <HI>his own Righteousness</HI> in the Room of <HI>the Righteousness of God;</HI> and consequently his Expec|tations must perish.&mdash;He that separates <HI>good Works</HI> from <HI>Faith,</HI> in his Life and Conversation, as tho' they were not requisite to Salvation, will be found very unfit for the Heavenly World, when the Decree brings forth, <HI>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer me then to conclude (Sir) with an earnest Intreaty, that, as you love your Soul, you would leave off unprofitable Disputes; and not distract your Mind, and carry away your Thoughts from practical Godliness, by such an earnest Application to these controverted Points: but see to it, that you come to the Footstool of divine Grace, as a lost unworthy perishing Sinner; that you depend only upon the Riches of God's free sovereign Grace, to draw you to Christ, and give you an Interest in him; that you look to Christ Jesus alone for
<PB N="320" REF="005572_0329_0000000000000000">
Righteousness and Strength; and chearfully trust in him as a safe Foundation of Confidence and Hope.&mdash;See to it, that the Life which you live in the Flesh, be by the <HI>Faith</HI> of the Son of God: and as you look to his Righteousness only for the Safety of your State, so likewise repair by <HI>Faith</HI> to his Fulness for all Supplies of Grace, whereby you may make a Progress in Holiness.&mdash;See to it, that you don't quiet your Conscience with a <HI>dead Faith:</HI> but always remember, that <HI>he who hath this Hope in Christ, purifies himself even as he is pure;</HI> and that as your Person cannot be <HI>justified,</HI> but by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, so your <HI>Faith</HI> cannot be <HI>justified,</HI> but by a careful Diligence in maintaining <HI>good Works.</HI>&mdash;Having therefore <HI>with the Heart believed unto Righ|teousness,</HI> be you in a humble Dependance upon Christ, <HI>stedfast and unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord: and your Labour will not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>That you may be <HI>kept by the Power of God thro' Faith,</HI> and <HI>receive the End of your Faith,</HI> the <HI>Salvation of your Soul,</HI> is the Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. Wherein is consi|der'd in what Respects good Works are necessary; and our Obligations to them represented and urg'd.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Observation is just, that <Q><HI>it would be unsutable and unseasonable to make Apologies for this further Trouble</HI> [as you are pleased to call it] <HI>after I have given you so many Assu|rances of my chearful Readiness, to contribute all in my Power to your best Interest.</HI></Q>&mdash;Indeed Sir, I have found nothing troublesome in the whole Pro|gress of our Correspondence, excepting some dark Apprehensions of late, left you would <HI>frustrate the Grace of God,</HI> in <HI>seeking Righteousness, not by Faith,</HI> but <HI>as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> But it now greatly animates my Endeavours to serve you, to find those Fears on my Part so happily remov'd, by finding <Q><HI>the Difficulties on your Part obviated, in that im|portant Point, and you satisfied with Respect to the Foundation of your Hope.</HI></Q> I am sensible, that the Principles, which I have been pleading for, are <Q><HI>commonly loaded with opprobrious Invectives, as being destructive of an holy Life, and subversive of Mora|lity and Godliness.</HI></Q> But I think I have already given you sufficient Evidence, that all these Insinu|ations are mere Calumnies; and that there is no other possible Foundation, than what I have repre|sented to you, for a Life of true Holiness and Piety.
<PB N="322" REF="005572_0331_0000000000000000">
I appeal to your own Observation and Experience, whether in general there be any that live more <HI>holy</HI> Lives, and more honour their Profession, than they who most strictly adhere to the Doctrines of special <HI>Grace,</HI> and depend upon Christ alone for <HI>Righte|ousness</HI> and <HI>Strength:</HI> And whether they, on the contrary, who depend upon their <HI>good Works</HI> for a Title to the divine Favour, don't too commonly shew the Weakness of their Foundation, by the Carelesness and Unfruitfulness of their Lives.</P>
<P>The Question which you propose, is however worthy of a distinct Consideration.&mdash;<Q><HI>How far and in what Respects are our good Works necessary to Salvation?</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Order to give you a proper View of this Case, it will be needful to answer this Question both <HI>negatively</HI> and <HI>positively:</HI> Or to shew you wherein our <HI>good Works</HI> ought to have no Place, nor be at all look'd to or depended upon; and then to shew you wherein <HI>good Works</HI> ought to have Place, and in what Respect they are necessary to every Christian indeed, that would entertain a well-grounded Hope of eternal Life.</P>
<P>In my <HI>negative</HI> Answer to this Question, I must first observe, that we are not to do <HI>good Works,</HI> in Order to <HI>change</HI> God's <HI>Purposes</HI> and <HI>Designs</HI> towards us; or to excite his <HI>Benevolence</HI> and <HI>Compassion</HI> to us.&mdash;I suspect, it's too common a Case, for Men to depend upon their penitent Frames, their Duties, their Reformations, their Works of Charity, or other religious Exercises, as what will excite Af|fections, Passions, or Compassions in the glorious God, correspondent to what they find in themselves. And thence, when Conscience upbraids the Sinner for his past Provocations to God, he hopes to ap|pease
<PB N="323" REF="005572_0332_0000000000000000">
his Displeasure by his Remorse, by his Duties, or by his more careful future Conduct: And now <HI>he is delivered to do all these Abominations,</HI> his Ac|count is ballanced, and he begins upon a new Score. Thence it is, that his Hopes and Fears bear Pro|portion to his Frames and Carriages. Every serious Pang, every religious Duty, or moral Practice, which his Conscience approves, will raise his dejected Hopes; and give him comforting Expectations of the divine Favour. But it should always be re|membred, that the <HI>Change</HI> to be hoped for by our Duties, religious Frames, or moral Conduct, must be in <HI>our selves,</HI> and not in God. <HI>He is of one Mind, and who can turn him? He is the Lord, he changeth not.</HI> We are therefore not to look to our <HI>good Works,</HI> but to the Redeemer's Merits, and the infinite Mercy of the divine Nature, as what will render God propitious to us.&mdash;Though we are only to hope for Mercy in a Way of Duty, it is not because this will render God more willing to <HI>bestow</HI> it; but because it is the <HI>Way,</HI> which God has ap|pointed, to render <HI>us</HI> more dispos'd and ready to receive it.&mdash;It is an Imagination very unworthy of God, to suppose, that we can move him to the Exercise of Compassion, whose very Nature is Goodness and Love it self; that we can excite any Mercy in him, whose infinite <HI>Mercy endures forever:</HI> or that we can procure any Change of Purpose in him who is <HI>without any Variableness, or Shadow of turning.</HI>&mdash;When the glorious God treats with us, as if he were a Partaker of human Affections and Passions, this is in mere Condescension to our Weak|ness; we being uncapable to behold him as he is. Surely it is not to lead us into Apprehensions, that he is <HI>altogether such an one as our selves.</HI> Our Busi|ness
<PB N="324" REF="005572_0333_0000000000000000">
therefore is, to <HI>come to Christ, and learn of him,</HI> to bow our Necks to <HI>his Yoke,</HI> to do <HI>good Works</HI> from Faith in Christ, and out of Love &amp; Obedience to him; and in that Way to hope in God for Mercy, for Christ's Sake, and for his own Sake; and not for ours. We are to obey him as a gracious Sove|reign; and to hope in him as the sovereign Author and Donor of his own Favours. We are to hope in his Mercy, not because we can allure him to the Exercise of it, or recommend our selves to him, by any Thing we can do: But because he is <HI>infinite in Goodness, and delighteth in Mercy. The Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance.</HI> Rom. xi. 29.</P>
<P>I may add, we are not to do <HI>good Works</HI> with a View to <HI>qualify</HI> us for our Reception of Christ by <HI>Faith,</HI> or for our Interest in him.&mdash;Multitudes seem most dangerously to deceive their Souls in this Matter. It's but too common a Case for Men to quiet their Consciences, and to entertain Hopes of Salvation, from Apprehensions, that they endea|vour to be found in a Way of Duty, they endea|vour to mortify their Lusts, and to live a holy Life; and therefore, though guilty of many Defects both in their Duties and Conversations, they hope God will accept them upon Christ's Account, that the Merits of Christ will make up the Defects of their Performances, and his Blood cleanse them from the Guilt of their Sins.&mdash;If they should fall into some more gross and enormous Sin, or grow care|less and remiss in Duty, they'll then perhaps fell into a Panick, and terrify themselves with Appre|hensions, that Christ will not accept such as they are: but when they have reform'd their Conduct, their Fears blow over, and they revive their Hopes,
<PB N="325" REF="005572_0334_0000000000000000">
that they shall yet obtain Mercy for Christ's Sake. And what is the natural Language of all this, but that they shall obtain an Interest in Christ by their <HI>good Works;</HI> and when <HI>they</HI> have done <HI>their</HI> Part, <HI>he</HI> will do <HI>the rest,</HI> will make up the Defects of their Attainments, and give such a Value to their sincere (though imperfect) Obedience, that this shall recommend them to the Favour and Accep|tance of God.&mdash;As though the glorious Redeemer undertook our Ransom, for no other End, than to render our deficient Duties meritorious: and our Sins innocent and inoffensive.&mdash;This <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>self|righteous</HI> Principle seems generally to obtain with the careless carnal World. And when Sinners come under Conviction of their Guilt and Danger, they are yet influenced by the same legal Dispo|sition, though it appear in another Form. What distressing Fears and Terrors do they usually ago|nize under! How impossible is it to give them any sensible View of <HI>the Hope that is set before them!</HI> But what stands in the Way? Their Sins are great, their Hearts are hard, their Duties formal and hy|pocritical, their Corruptions prevalent, that they can't think Christ will accept such as they are; and therefore they dare not venture their Souls and their eternal Interests upon him.&mdash;Were the Case otherwise, could they subdue these stubborn Hearts, could they get a Victory over these Corruptions, sanctify these depraved Affections, and be more spiritual in their Duties; or in other Words, could they themselves, <HI>begin</HI> their own Salvation, then they could depend upon Christ to <HI>carry on</HI> the Work in their Souls; and then they could hope, that God would accept them for Christ's Sake.&mdash;But all this is to substitute <HI>our own Righteousness</HI> in
<PB N="326" REF="005572_0335_0000000000000000">
the Place and Stead of <HI>the Righteousness of Christ;</HI> or at best, to divide the Work of our Salvation between Christ and our selves.</P>
<P>Will you bear with me, Sir, if I am forc'd to express my Fears, that you are yet under too great Remainders of this unhappy Disposition.&mdash;I re|joice in your Recovery from your late dangerous Mistake. I can't but hope, that you have <HI>chosen the good Part, which shall not be taken from you.</HI>&mdash;But what mean the frequent Returns of your de|sponding Hours? Whence do your Hopes and Fears bear Proportion to your present Frames? What occasions those many dark Apprehensions, not only that you have not yet an Interest in Christ; but that you shall never attain to it?&mdash;I intreat you to consider, that <HI>Christ came to save Sinners;</HI> and that we must come to him and trust in him <HI>as Sin|ners,</HI> having no valuable Qualification of our own to intitle us to his Favour, Nothing but our Guilt and Pollution and his Sufficiency to plead, for our Acceptance with and Interest in him.&mdash;In Propor|tion as you look to your own Qualifications to recommend you to Christ, so far you practically make a Saviour of your <HI>good Works;</HI> and reject the Terms of Salvation by Jesus Christ.&mdash;As it is cer|tain, that you can have no <HI>good Works,</HI> which are acceptable to God for any saving Purposes, till you have <HI>Faith,</HI> in Christ: so it is also certain, that you need not seek for any in Order to your chear|ful Trust in him and Dependance upon him, to <HI>justify</HI> you by his Righteousness, to <HI>sanctify</HI> you by his Spirit, and to <HI>make you an Heir according to the Hope of eternal Life.</HI>&mdash;The Gospel brings glorious Tidings of Salvation to perishing Sinners. It ex|empts and excludes none who will come to Christ
<PB N="327" REF="005572_0336_0000000000000000">
<HI>for Life,</HI> who will come to him as <HI>lost Sinners,</HI> under a Sense of their Guilt and Unworthiness; who will <HI>buy of Him Wine and Milk, without Money and with|out Price;</HI> and who will <HI>take the Water of Life freely.</HI> Be their Sins ever so great, <HI>his Blood will cleanse them from all their Sins.</HI> Be their Hearts ever so hard, <HI>he will take away their Hearts of Stone, and give them Hearts of Flesh.</HI> Be they ever so destitute of any gracious Qualification, <HI>of his Fulness they shall receive, even Grace for Grace.</HI> Whatever their Case be, they may safely trust in him, as the <HI>Author of eternal Salvation.</HI>&mdash;But this alas! is the Misery and Ruin of Multitudes, who are pretending to seek Salvation by Christ, that they are for dividing the Work of their Salvation between him and them: And by substracting the Honour of their Salvation from him, who will do all or nothing for them, though <HI>they follow after the Law of Righteousness, they don't obtain it; because they seek it, not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI>&mdash;Here then you see, that <HI>good Works</HI> have no Place at all. We are to look after no recommending Qualifications for an Interest in Christ: but to come to him guilty and miserable as we are, that he <HI>may be all and in all,</HI> be all to us, and do all in us and for us. <HI>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI> Mat. ix. 13.</P>
<P>I must further add, that we are not to do <HI>good Works,</HI> in Expectation that we shall by them obtain a <HI>Title</HI> to the <HI>future Inheritance.</HI>&mdash;Heaven is a <HI>purchased Possession.</HI> Our Title to it, our Qualification for it, our Perseverance in the Way that leads thither, and our eternal Enjoyment of the glorious Inhe|ritance, are all <HI>purchased</HI> by the <HI>Blood of Christ.</HI> In all these Respects, <HI>Christ Jesus is our Hope;</HI> and
<PB N="328" REF="005572_0337_0000000000000000">
when <HI>we rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God,</HI> we must <HI>rejoice in Christ Jesus, having no Confidence in the Flesh.</HI> It can't be too deeply impressed upon our Hearts, that it is <HI>not by Works of Righteousness, which we have done, but of his Mercy, that God saveth us.</HI> It is mere <HI>Mercy</HI> in the eternal Contrivance of our Sal|vation by Christ; mere <HI>Mercy</HI> in his Incarnation, Humiliation, Obedience and Sufferings for us; mere <HI>Mercy</HI> in the Application of his Redemption to our Souls; mere <HI>Mercy,</HI> that <HI>we are kept by the Power of God, through Faith to Salvation;</HI> and mere <HI>Mercy,</HI> that Christ will at last <HI>present us faultless be|fore the Throne of God, with exceeding Joy.</HI> It is <HI>to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace, wherein we are made accepted in the Beloved.</HI>&mdash;Our <HI>good Works</HI> can|not have any Share in purchasing our Title to this Salvation. They cannot make Atonement for our Sins; because the Iniquity of our most holy Things stands in Need of Atonement. They cannot give us a Covenant-Right to Mercy; because we are antecedently Sinners, and obnoxious to the Curses of the broken Law. They cannot make us meet for Salvation; because by their Imperfections they still leave us open to the Curse; and because they cannot sanctify our Nature, and give us new Hearts. Nor can they give us any Claim to the special In|fluences of the Spirit of God; because then our Sanctification would be of <HI>Debt,</HI> and <HI>not of Grace.</HI> What then can they do? No more, than to bring us to the Foot of a sovereign God, to wait upon him in the Way of his Appointments, that <HI>he would work in us both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>You'll remember, that I am here speaking of our being <HI>intitled</HI> to Salvation by our <HI>good Works;</HI> and not of their Usefulness to our spiritual and eternal

Welfare. In the former Sense, they must be ut|terly disclaim'd; and <HI>all our Righteousnesses</HI> esteem'd <HI>but as filthy Rags;</HI> as I have particularly shewn you in some former Letters.

<P>I shall only subjoin, that we must not depend upon our <HI>good Works</HI> for a <HI>progressive Sanctification,</HI> for renewed Supplies of Grace, and for a conti|nued Progress in Holiness and Comfort, unto God's heavenly Kingdom. It is a dangerous Mistake, which too many seem to fall into, that we are to depend upon Christ alone for <HI>justifying</HI> Righteous|ness: but trust to our own active Endeavours for <HI>inherent</HI> Righteousness, for a Victory over our Cor|ruptions, and for a Conformity of Heart and Life unto the divine Nature and Will.

that although they carry on a dreadful Struggle with their Corruptions, yet these, notwithstanding all their Purposes, Promises, Vows, Watchings, Fas|tings and other mechanical Endeavours, will still prevail, and often throw them into great Perplex|ity and Confusion.&mdash;They are sensible, that God demands their <HI>Hearts;</HI> and that it is impossible, their external Reformations should be accepta|ble, while their Hearts are far from him, and led away with divers Lusts. With what Agony and Toil do they therefore worry with their carnal and sensual Affections, their impetuous Appetites and Passions; using various Methods of Mortification and Discipline, to correct the Disorders of their Nature: And are but still rolling a Stone up Hill, which as soon as they let go, it is at the Bottom again.&mdash;They are sensible, that God requires Sin|cerity in the inward Man, in all the Duties of re|ligious <HI>Worship.</HI> They therefore groan under the Burden of their religious Defects, their Deadness, Formality and wandering Thoughts in their Ap|proaches to God; condemn every Duty they per|form, and resolve upon more Watchfulness and Care for the future: but alas! the Difficulty re|mains; and they are ready to sink under discoura|ging Apprehensions of their Hypocrisy. Indeed, when they gain a little Ground, their Hopes are revived and their Endeavours animated: but when Deadness and Corruption prevail, their Distress and Fear return and prevail with them, their Spirits sink, and they are ready to be quite discouraged.

<P N="1">1. Then <HI>good Works</HI> are necessary, as being one <HI>Design</HI> of our <HI>Election, Redemption,</HI> and <HI>effectual Vo|cation.</HI>&mdash;They are one End of our Election. <HI>God hath chosen us in Christ, before the Foundation of the World, that we should be holy and without Blame be|fore him in Love.</HI> Eph. i. 4.

And they who are indeed in|terested in this Redemption, who indeed have
<PB N="334" REF="005572_0343_0000000000000000">
<HI>believed in God</HI> our Saviour, who sincerely trust in Christ for needed Supplies, will feel the Power of his Grace, quickning their Souls, and exciting in them a zealous <HI>Carefulness to maintain good Works:</HI> and therefore such have no Grounds to conclude upon their Interest in Christ, who live careless sensual Lives, in the Neglect of Duty to God, of Righte|ousness or Charity to Men; or in a willing Indul|gence of any Way of Sinning.&mdash;I may add, <HI>good Works</HI> are also the End of our Vocation. <HI>God hath called us unto Holiness.</HI> I Thess. iv. 7. We are ac|cordingly instructed, that <HI>as he which hath called us is holy, so we should be holy in all Manner of Conver|sation.</HI> I Pet. i. 15. None therefore have any Grounds to flatter themselves with the Dream of a regenerate State, while they indulge themselves in any sinful Way, or live in the Neglect of <HI>good Works;</HI> whatever Experiences they may pretend to, or whatever Joys and Comforts they may en|tertain. <HI>This we are to affirm constantly, that they which believe in God, must be</HI> and will be <HI>careful to maintain good Works.</HI> Tit. iii. 8. Tho' <HI>good Works</HI> are not the Fountain and Foundation of a renewed Nature, they are always the Streams that flow from that Fountain, and the Superstructure upon that Foundation. Though they don't sanctify us, they are the natural and necessary Actings and Opera|tions of a sanctified Heart. An unholy Life gives the Lie to our Profession of an holy State: and in|fers on us the just Denomination of <HI>Liars.</HI> (I. Joh. 2. 4.)&mdash;It defeats all Pretensions to effectual Call|ing; it contradicts the very End of Conversion; and is contrary to the unalterable Tendency of the new Nature. Grace is given for Exercise; and is a vital, operative Principle. We shall therefore
<PB N="335" REF="005572_0344_0000000000000000">
<HI>receive the Grace of God in vain,</HI> if the Principle be not exerted in agreeable Practice.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary, as they belong to the <HI>Way</HI> leading to Heaven, and are <HI>preparative</HI> for the <HI>Possession</HI> of it. They are so necessary in this Respect, that it is certain, that no Man who has the Opportunity after his Conversion for a Life of <HI>good Works,</HI> will ever get to Heaven in any other Way. <HI>Without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> Heb. xii. 14.&mdash;We must not only <HI>enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> but walk in <HI>the narrow Way which lead|eth unto Life.</HI> Christ is the supreme and compre|hensive Way: but <HI>Holiness</HI> is a subordinate and subservient Way. Neither do any <HI>walk in Christ,</HI> unless they walk before him in <HI>true Holiness.</HI>&mdash;They who would hope for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> hereafter, must have it <HI>begun</HI> in their Souls here. Their Hearts must be in some Measure conformed to the divine Nature and Will, that they may be attempered and qualified for the Enjoyments and Employments of the heavenly World. How could such Men find Comfort and Pleasure in the eternal Service of God, to whom his Service here is ungrateful and bur|densome? None therefore are in the Way to Heaven, but they who by a Life of Holiness are preparing, and labouring after a <HI>Meetness to be Par|takers of an Inheritance among the Saints in Light.</HI>&mdash;There is nothing more certain, than that a Life of Sin and Impiety, Sloth and Irreligion, leads down to the Chambers of Death: And it is therefore equally certain, that Christ Jesus leads none to Heaven in that Road. It is true indeed, that we may be in the Way to Heaven, while compassed with many Infirmities, while groaning under much Deadness and Formality in
<PB N="336" REF="005572_0345_0000000000000000">
Duty, while liable to many involuntary Surprises into Sin, while greatly defective in our religious Attainments, and in our Conduct, both towards God and Man. But they have not this Hope, who live in the wilful Neglect of known Duty, who deliberately indulge themselves in known Ways of sinning against God, who roll any Iniquity as a sweet Morsel under their Tongue; or live in an allow'd Violation of the Laws of Righteousness, Charity, and Peace towards Men. <HI>If any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</HI> And if any Man have the Spirit of Christ, <HI>the Fruit of the Spirit in him will be Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suf|fering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Tem|perance:</HI> And <HI>they who live in the Spirit, will also walk in the Spirit.</HI> We must <HI>by a patient Continu|ance in well doing, seek for Glory, Honour, and Im|mortality,</HI> if we would inherit <HI>eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary as Acts of <HI>Obedience</HI> to God's Commands; and a just Acknowledgment of <HI>his Dominion</HI> over us.&mdash;By Right of <HI>Creation,</HI> the blessed God has an unalienable Claim to Homage and Honour from us. By the immutable Laws of our very Being and Nature, as his Creatures and Dependents, we are under Bonds of Subjection and Obedience to Him. The Grace of the Gospel does not cancel those natural Obligations, or lessen the Force of them. Christ <HI>came not to destroy the Law:</HI> Nor do <HI>we make void the Law through Faith,</HI> but rather establish it. The great God has not laid down his Right of Sovereignty and Dominion over us, by affording us a Medium of Reconciliation to him|self, and a Title to eternal Happiness: But rather has that Way laid us under further and stronger Obligations to Obedience. Our Freedom from the
<PB N="337" REF="005572_0346_0000000000000000">
Curses and severe Demands of the moral Law, as a <HI>Covenant</HI> of Life, is so far from freeing us of our Duty towards it as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Practice, or excusing us from a careful Observance of its Precepts, that the <HI>glorious Liberty</HI> we are made Partakers of, is given us for this very End, <HI>that we may serve God without Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before him, all the Days of our Lives.</HI> Though the moral Law be presented to us now under some different Respects and Considerations, from what it was originally, yet the same Law remains the <HI>Rule</HI> of Obedience, con|firmed and enforced (as such) by the <HI>Gospel</HI> it self. Whence it follows, that to live a careless, sinful, sensual, worldly Life, in the Neglect of our Duty towards God and our Neighbour and our selves, is more <HI>aggravated</HI> Rebellion against God, than the same Life of Impiety would have been under the Covenant of Works. For now a Life of Impiety is not only a Violation of the Precepts of the <HI>Law,</HI> but of the <HI>Gospel</HI> too. And the greater Discoveries God has been pleased to make of his glorious Per|fections, the greater Manifestations he has made of his Goodness and Mercy, the greater are our Obligations to Obedience, and consequently the greater will be our Rebellion, as well as Ingratitude, if we continue disobedient.&mdash;We are therefore to consider, that instead of God's suspending his Right of Dominion, or abating our Obligations to Obe|dience, under the present Dispensation of Gospel-Light and Love, he requires and expects of us greater Watchfulness and Care to please and hon|our him, greater Purity and Holiness, than under the more legal and imperfect Dispensation of <HI>Moses.</HI> It is undoubtedly true, that those Sins and Imper|fections, which were consistent with a State of
<PB N="338" REF="005572_0347_0000000000000000">
Grace, under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensation, are not so now under the <HI>Christian</HI> Dispensation; wherein not only we have more Light and Knowledge, but Christians indeed do obtain more purifying and quickning Influences of the Spirit, than they then ordinarily did.&mdash;There is therefore no Room to extenuate our Falls into Sin, by the Examples of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Saints. For though that Ministration was glorious, yet <HI>the Ministration of the Spirit is more glorious,</HI> has a <HI>Glory that</HI> vastly <HI>excelleth.</HI> (2 Cor. iii. 8, 9, 10.) By the <HI>Beholding of which Glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory.</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 18.) Our enjoying the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Gospel lays us under the strongest and most indispensable Obligations, to <HI>cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> and to <HI>perfect Holiness in the Fear of God.</HI> 2. Cor. vii. I.&mdash;<HI>God forbid,</HI> that any of us <HI>should continue in Sin, that Grace may abound;</HI> or turn <HI>the Grace of God into Lasciviousness.</HI> This would determine us to be <HI>ungodly Men, who deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> (Jude 4.) Thence it is, that the Disobedience of Gospel-Sinners will bring upon them the greatest and most dreadful Damnation. See <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 29.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary, as Expressions of our <HI>Gratitude</HI> to God for all his Goodness to us, more especially for Gospel-Grace, and most espe|cially for the gracious Influences of his blessed Spi|rit.&mdash;Impossible it is, for us to have any due Con|ception, how great our Debt of Gratitude is, to our infinite Benefactor. <HI>He has made us, and not we our selves, his Hands have fram'd and fashion'd us round about.</HI> He has <HI>preserv'd</HI> us through innume|rable Difficulties and Dangers; and all our Lives continually follow'd us with Loving-kindness and
<PB N="339" REF="005572_0348_0000000000000000">
tender Mercies. He has made this mighty Globe for our Use, with all its amazing Variety of Fur|niture, fitted to supply us with whatever is neces|sary, convenient, comfortable or delightful. He has distinguish'd us from very much the greatest Part of our Fellow-Creatures, by the Abundance of our Enjoyments, and the Greatness of our Privi|leges.&mdash;And if all these, and the innumerable other Instances of the inexpressible Kindness and Good|ness of God to us, be not sufficient to excite our Gratitude, and to attract our Affections to such an infinite Fountain of Benevolence, yet certainly our <HI>Redemption</HI> by Jesus Christ, our Enjoyment of Go|spel-Ordinances, our Advantages to live to God in this World, and to be eternally happy in the En|joyment of him in the future State of everlasting Light and Love, are enough to carry our Minds beyond Admiration, and even to overwhelm them with Astonishment. And what Returns does the glorious God expect from us, for all this? No more, than the Love and Obedience of our thankful Hearts &amp; fruitful Lives: No more than to live to him, and delight in him, gratefully to receive, and faith|fully to improve the Benefits he is bestowing upon us. He requires Nothing of us, but that we should be <HI>ready to every good Work,</HI> out of Love and Gra|titude to God.&mdash;How unworthy shall we therefore be for ever, of one Smile of his Countenance, or the least Favour and Kindness, if the infinite Good|ness of God, his infinite Love and Compassion in Christ, don't <HI>constrain us,</HI> to renounce our Lusts and Idols, and make it our delightful Endeavour to seek and serve him!&mdash;He may well expostulate with such, as with his an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ient People, <HI>Will ye thus re|quite the Lord, O foolish People, and unwise!</HI> He

justly may, and certainly will exclude such from the Glory and Blessedness of his eternal Praises, who han't Hearts to love him, and serve him, and praise him here.&mdash;They who have ever <HI>tasted that the Lord is gracious,</HI> and have any becoming Sense of their Obligations to him, will study <HI>what they shall render to the Lord, for all his Benefits;</HI> they will delight in Endeavours to glorify him; they will be solici|tously careful of a constant Conformity to his Will, and take a peculiar Pleasure and Pains in <HI>following after Holiness.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. As I have distinctly consider'd in my last, <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary <HI>Evidences</HI> of the Truth and Sincerity of our <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ. And I need only add here, <HI>It is a faithful Saying,</HI> which can't be too much insisted upon, <HI>that they who</HI> pretend to <HI>have believed in God, must be careful to maintain good Works.</HI> All their Profession of Religion, all their imaginary <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, all their Peace and Joy, all their Appearance in the Cause of Truth, all their seeming Zeal for the Glory of God, the Interest of Religion, and the Conversion and Salvation of Sinners, or whatever else they may suppose <HI>Evi|dences</HI> of their renewed State, will prove but as <HI>sounding Brass and a tinkling Cymbal,</HI> without a real Life of <HI>good Works.</HI>&mdash;Such are greatly to be pitied, who can <HI>have Peace</HI> from any supposed Experiences of Grace, while they <HI>walk in the Imaginations of their own Hearts.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ will own none as belonging to him, but those who are a <HI>pe|culiar People,</HI> in some Measure, <HI>zealous of good Works.</HI> He will in the Day of Accounts declare to all others, that <HI>he never knew them;</HI> and sentence them to <HI>depart from him, as Workers of Iniquity.</HI>&mdash;But to this I have spoken particularly already.&mdash;And therefore
<PB N="341" REF="005572_0350_0000000000000000">
shall only subjoin here, that <HI>Obedience</HI> is the ge|nuine Exercise, and therefore a necessary Evidence of Faith unfeigned.

Without we exemplify the <HI>Obedience of Faith, our Faith is vain.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary to <HI>honour our Pro|fession,</HI> to <HI>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour,</HI> and to bring <HI>Glory to his Name.</HI>&mdash;There is Nothing infers a greater Scandal upon our holy Religion, than the unsanctified Lives of its Professors. This gives Occasion to the Enemies of the Cross of Christ, to <HI>blaspheme his Name,</HI> and <HI>speak Evil of the Way of Truth;</HI> to call Religion itself a Cheat; and judge all that make an Appearance of Holiness, to be Hypocrites and false Pretenders. This casts a <HI>stum|bling-Block</HI> in the Way of poor Souls, that are be|ginning to look <HI>Zion ward;</HI> and proves a sad Temp|tation to Apostasy. This <HI>hardens</HI> secure Sinners in their sinful Courses; and pacifies their Consci|ences, from the Thought that such who make Pre|tences to Religion, are impious and Wicked, as well as they. And what is still worse, <HI>if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves also are found Sinners,</HI> this brings great Dishonour upon our bless|ed Saviour, as though he were the <HI>Minister of Sin;</HI> and has a dreadful Tendency to render the Means of Grace ineffectual, to <HI>quench the Spirit,</HI> and to drive the very <HI>Form,</HI> as well as <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> out of the World.&mdash;You therefore see the Necessity of <HI>good Works</HI> and of a holy Life, if we have any Value for the Interests of Christ's Kingdom in the World, any Pity to the precious Souls of Men, any Regard to the Honour of our blessed Saviour,
<PB N="342" REF="005572_0351_0000000000000000">
and the holy Religion which we profess; and any Desire to escape having the Guilt of other Men's Sins, as well as our own, charged to our Account in the Day of Christ.&mdash;If there be any Force in these and many other like Motives, to prompt us to a Life of Holiness, we who profess our selves Christians, should approve our selves <HI>a chosen Gene|ration, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People, to shew forth the Praises of him, who has called us out of Darkness into his marvellous Light.</HI> I Pet. ii. 9.&mdash;Indeed the chief End of Man is to glorify God! 'Tis the Design of our Creation: and 'tis the Design of our Redemption. <HI>For ye are bought with a Price; therefore glorify God, in your Body, and in your Spirit, which are God's.</HI> I Cor. vi. 20. 'Tis the Design of our Baptism and Profession, and of all our Experience of the Operations of the Spirit of Grace; and should be the Scope of all our Con|versation and Practice.&mdash;But, how shall we act in Cor|respondence to this Design, unless <HI>we care for the Things of the Lord, that we may be holy, both in Body and Spirit; diligently following every good Work?</HI> We should study, <HI>whatever we do, to do all to the Glory of God.</HI> I Cor. x. 31. And to this Purpose it is necessary, that we <HI>follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.</HI> For <HI>by breaking the Law,</HI> we <HI>dishonour God;</HI> but <HI>herein is he glorify'd, that we bear much Fruit,</HI> in an exemplary and useful Life.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Good Works</HI> are likewise necessary to our in|ward <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Comfort.</HI>&mdash;We often see that Obser|vation verified, that the <HI>Wicked are like a troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose Waters cast up Mire and Dirt;</HI> and that <HI>there is no Peace to the Wicked.</HI> They must have <HI>seared Consciences</HI> indeed, who can have peaceable Minds in a Progress of Sin, and
<PB N="343" REF="005572_0352_0000000000000000">
in the Neglect of practical Godliness. A truly <HI>tender</HI> Conscience will always remonstrate against the Indulgence of any <HI>Sin,</HI> either of Omission or Commission. And how unhappy and uncomforta|ble a Life is it, to have our own Hearts condem|ning us; to have a Worm gnawing in our Breasts, to have Conscience applying the Terrors of the Law, and representing to us our Guilt and Danger? And yet this cannot be avoided without a Life of <HI>good Works.</HI> We cannot have Grounds of <HI>Rejoic|ing,</HI> but from <HI>the Testimony of our Consciences, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wis|dom, but by the Grace of God we have had our Conver|sation in the World.</HI> 2 Cor. i. 12.&mdash;As they who live careless and sensual Lives, cannot have good <HI>Evidences</HI> of a renewed Nature and a safe State, they must necessarily be <HI>Strangers</HI> to that <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> which flows from the refreshing Views of an Interest in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> and from the Sense of our having the eternal God for our <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Friend,</HI> compassionately to provide for us here, and to make us eternally happy in the Enjoyment of himself.&mdash;They must likewise be altogether <HI>Strangers</HI> to the unspeakable Consolation, which flows from a Life of <HI>Communion</HI> with God. For this is never obtain'd without a Progress of Holi|ness and good Works.&mdash;If therefore we would have the <HI>continual Feast</HI> of a peaceful Conscience; if we would enjoy a comfortable View of the divine Favour, and <HI>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of God;</HI> if we would find by blessed Experience, that the <HI>Ways of Wisdom are Ways of Pleasantness and all her Paths Peace;</HI> if we would obtain the <HI>Sealings</HI> of the blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Earnest</HI> of our eternal Inheritance, and the <HI>Foretaste</HI> of heavenly Happiness, which
<PB N="344" REF="005572_0353_0000000000000000">
Enjoyments vastly preferable to all the Pleasures of Sense, we must <HI>add to our Faith Virtue,</HI> and main|tain a Life of Holiness and good Works. For <HI>if we say, that we have Fellowship with him, and walk in Darkness, we lie, and do not the Truth,</HI> 1 Joh. i. 6. But <HI>then shall I not be ashamed, when I have Respect to all God's Commandments. Great Peace have they which love his Law; and nothing shall offend them.</HI> Psal. cxix. 6, 165.</P>
<P>I might in several other Particulars exemplify to you the Necessity of <HI>good Works:</HI> but you'll pro|bably acknowledge, that I have said enough already, to take off the Odium cast upon us, as if we deny'd the Necessity of <HI>good Works</HI> in reference to Salva|tion. I shall therefore only add, &mdash;</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Good Works</HI> are necessary in Order to our <HI>escaping eternal Ruin and Misery.</HI>&mdash;I have shewn you indeed, and I think sufficiently prov'd, that they are not necessary as an Atonement for our Sins, or as what will appease the Wrath of God, and procure us an Acquittance from Guilt, and a Right to be freed from Condemnation. But still it is nevertheless certain, that in Fact no Man will escape the amazing Horrors of eternal Perdition, who has had Opportunity for a religious Life, and yet has not been fruitful in <HI>good Works.</HI>&mdash;This will be the final Test, to prove our Sincerity to|wards God: and the eternal Judgment will turn upon this Evidence.&mdash;The great Judge of the World will quickly appear, and <HI>his Reward will be with him, to render unto every Man according as his Works have been;</HI> and then he will inflict on those <HI>who are contentious and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteousness, Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguish.</HI> Rom. ii. 8, 9.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="005572_0354_0000000000000000">As therefore it is not a small Matter to inha|bit the dreadful Flames of Hell, the Seat of enraged Justice and burning Vengeance, through eternal Ages, it cannot but be of the greatest Im|portance to take Pains to escape it; to <HI>repent and obey the Gospel, to watch and pray,</HI> to be active and diligent in all the Ways of Religion, if so be <HI>we may be accounted worthy to escape</HI> that tremendous Misery, and made meet to <HI>stand before the Son of Man.</HI>&mdash;We have no other Choice before us, but to be holy here, or unhappy for ever. We must obtain Grace from God, and live to him in the Exercise of Grace, or be separated from his Pre|sence for ever, as unmeet Objects of his Favour. And will not all readily acknowledge, that the for|mer is infinitely to be preferred by every one, who has any just value for his present Interest, or for his eternal Happiness!&mdash;How absurd is it in the View of common Reason, to <HI>love Death,</HI> or chuse an <HI>evident Token of Perdition,</HI> by being the <HI>Servants of Sin,</HI> and <HI>obeying it in the Lusts thereof!</HI></P>
<P>I hope, Sir, I have now answer'd not only your Question, but your Expectation. And yet that I may obviate all Mistakes, I will endeavour to give you a Review of the whole, in some plain familiar and practical <HI>Directions.</HI></P>
<P>If you suppose your self in an <HI>unregenerate</HI> State, be found most earnestly diligent in the <HI>Duties of Religion,</HI> in the Use of the <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> and in Endeavours of a Conformity of Life to the Will of God, as the <HI>Way</HI> in which <HI>God will be enquired of by you,</HI> that he may bestow his converting and sanctifying Grace upon you.&mdash;It is true, that God is the sovereign Author and Donor of his own spe|cial Favours: but it is also true, that he has given
<PB N="346" REF="005572_0355_0000000000000000">
you no Encouragement to hope for them, in any other Way but that of <HI>Duty.</HI>&mdash;In this Way there|fore do you be found; pleading with him for the Influences of his Holy Spirit, to <HI>draw you to Christ,</HI> and to work the Work of <HI>Faith</HI> with Power in your Soul. In this Way you may hope in his Mercy, not indeed for the Sake of your Duties, but for the Sake of Christ's infinite Merits, and the boundless Grace and Goodness of the divine Na|ture. But in the Neglect of this Way of <HI>Duty,</HI> you have not the least Encouragement from the Word of God, to hope for the renewing Influ|ences of the blessed Spirit; without which you are undone eternally.</P>
<P>However, tho' even an unregenerate Man must thus <HI>strive to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> you must yet consider and realize to your self, that you are utterly uncapable of that <HI>Obedience</HI> which the Gos|pel requires, without <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ.&mdash;<HI>Faith</HI> is the first Act of evangelical Obedience, the Root of all other Graces, and the Principle of all such religious Duties as God will own &amp; accept. For <HI>without Faith it is impossible to please God,</HI> Heb. xi. 6. You must <HI>live in the Spirit,</HI> before you can <HI>walk in the Spirit.</HI>&mdash;Your first Business therefore is, not only earnestly to <HI>pray</HI> to God, that he would draw you to Christ: but you must endeavour to look to this precious Saviour, as to a sufficient Fountain of all Grace, trusting your Soul in his Hands, with encouraging Hope of Justification by his Righteousness, and Sanctification by his Spirit. If your <HI>Faith</HI> be sin|cere, you thereby lay a Foundation of spiritual and acceptable Obedience: but if not, the <HI>best Works</HI> that you can perform, will be only external, hy|pocritical, legal, and slavish Performances.&mdash;You
<PB N="347" REF="005572_0356_0000000000000000">
must therefore be bro't to act <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ for Holiness, as the Beginning of that Salvation which you hope to obtain from him. You are not to look upon a Life of Holiness and spiritual Obedience, as the Condition of your Salvation, but as the Salva|tion it self, which you hope for, actually begun in your Soul; and you have as much Warrant from the Invitations and Promises of the Gospel, to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for this Renovation of your Nature by his Spirit, as for the Justification of your Person by his Blood, or for an eternal Inheritance with the Saints in Light. And you must accord|ingly depend upon him for it, and ask it of him in <HI>Faith,</HI> or never obtain it.</P>
<P>I have proposed these Things to you, upon the Supposition that you have <HI>not satisfying Evidences</HI> of a converted State.&mdash;Let us now then suppose the Case to be otherwise; and you <HI>comfortably per|suaded,</HI> that you have experienced the happy Change. An humble and chearful <HI>Dependance</HI> upon Christ for new Supplies of Grace, must still be the Source of your persevering Obedience. Go on then to <HI>trust in him;</HI> and you'll find that he won't fail your Expectations. You'll find, that <HI>his Grace is sufficient for you.</HI></P>
<P>But don't deceive your self with an Imagination of your trusting in Christ, amidst a Course of sinful <HI>Negligence</HI> and <HI>Inactivity.</HI> Remember, that <HI>good Works</HI> are of indispensable Obligation, and of abso|lute Necessity in the Respects before-mention'd. You must not only trust in Christ to fulfil his good Pleasure in you: but you must <HI>live to him,</HI> in the Exercise of that Grace and Strength, which you derive from him.&mdash;In a humble Confidence in his sanctifying and quickning Influences, you must <HI>take
<PB N="348" REF="005572_0357_0000000000000000">
Heed to your self, and keep your Soul with all Diligence;</HI> you must see to it, that <HI>your Heart</HI> be <HI>right with God;</HI> that you <HI>delight in the Law of the Lord after the inward Man;</HI> that you maintain a strict Watch over your Affections, as well as Conversation; that you neglect no known Duty, toward God or Man; that you carefully improve your Time, and other Talents committed to your Trust; and endeavour, in a constant Course, to maintain a holy, humble, fruitful, thankful Life. And remember, that one Instance of <HI>Good Works,</HI> which God requires of you, is a daily <HI>Repentance</HI> of your sinful <HI>Defects;</HI> and a daily <HI>Mourning after</HI> a further <HI>Progress</HI> in Holiness.&mdash;After an Espousal to Christ by Faith, this is the Way, and the only Way of Comfort here and Hap|piness hereafter.</P>
<P>That I might set this important Point in as clear a Light as possible, I have labour'd to represent it in different Views; and thereby have necessarily run into some Repetitions, for which I depend upon your Candour:&mdash;Now, That the Lord would bless my Endeavours for your best Good, is the Prayer of,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you mean no more by your <Q><HI>Ignorance of the Nature of that Union to Christ, which I so often
<PB N="349" REF="005572_0358_0000000000000000">
mention'd,</HI></Q> but that you cannot form any adequate Idea of this incomprehensible Mystery, it is nothing wonderful. There are Multitudes of Things, whose Existence you are most intimately acquainted with, yet of whose special Manner of Existence you can have no Idea.&mdash;You have no Reason therefore to doubt of the Believer's <HI>Union to Christ,</HI> because you don't understand the Mode of it, any more than you have to doubt of the <HI>Union</HI> of your own Soul and Body, because you don't understand the Mode of it. 'Tis a sufficient Confirmation of the Truth of this Doctrine, that it is revealed in the <HI>Word of God.</HI> 'Tis sufficient for our present imperfect State, to know so much of the Nature of this <HI>Union</HI> as God has been pleased to reveal in the blessed Oracles of Truth.&mdash;It is your Mistake, to suppose, that <Q><HI>our Divines do but occasionally mention this Doctrine; but don't pretend to explain it.</HI></Q> Numbers of Divines have written well upon the delightful Subject: tho', I confess, it is too little consider'd by many of our practical Writers (as it ought to be consider'd) as being the <HI>Foundation</HI> of both our <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>Hope.</HI> Were it more distinctly consider'd, more particularly ex|plain'd, and more frequently insisted upon, im|prov'd and apply'd, both from the Pulpit and the Press, than it is, it would be a probable Means to check the Growth of those dangerous Errors, which prevail among us; and to give Men a deeper Sense of the Necessity of experimental vital Piety, in Order to a well-grounded Hope of the Favour of God.&mdash;You have therefore Reason to desire <HI>"a just, plain and familiar View of this Doctrine."</HI> And I shall endeavour according to your Desire, in as plain and easy a Manner as I can, to
<PB N="350" REF="005572_0359_0000000000000000">
give a brief and distinct Answer to your several Questions.</P>
<P>Your first Question is, <Q><HI>What is the Nature of that Union to Christ, which the Scriptures speak of; and what are we to understand by it?</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Answer to this Question, it may be proper in the first Place, to give you a brief View of the various <HI>Representations</HI> of this <HI>Union,</HI> in the Word of God; and from thence proceed to take some Notice of the special <HI>Nature</HI> of it, as it is repre|sented in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>It is sometimes represented in Scripture, by the <HI>strongest</HI> Expressions that human Language can admit, and even compared to the <HI>Union</HI> between God the Father and God the Son.&mdash;Thus, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> xvii. 11, 21, 22, 23. <HI>Holy Father, keep through thine own Name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as We are.&mdash;That they all may be one, as thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us.&mdash;That they may be one, even as We are one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Union</HI> is sometimes represented in Scrip|ture by lively <HI>Metaphors</HI> and Resemblances.</P>
<P>It is compared to the <HI>Union</HI> of a Vine and its Branches. Thus, <HI>Job.</HI> xv. 4, 5. <HI>Abide in me, and I in you. As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much Fruit: For without me ye can do Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>It is compared to the <HI>Union</HI> of our Meat and Drink with our Bodies. Thus, <HI>Job.</HI> vi. 56, 57. <HI>He that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, dwell|eth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath
<PB N="351" REF="005572_0360_0000000000000000">
sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</HI></P>
<P>It is frequently compared to the <HI>Union</HI> of the Body to the Head. Thus, Eph. iv. 15, 16. <HI>But speaking the Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all Things, which is the Head, even Christ: From whom the whole Body fitly joined together, and com|pacted by that which every Joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the Measure of every Part, maketh Increase of the Body, unto the edifying it self in Love.</HI></P>
<P>It is sometimes compared to the conjugal <HI>Union.</HI> Thus, <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 23, 30. <HI>For the Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the Body.&mdash;For we are Mem|bers of his Body, of his Flesh and of his Bones.</HI> Rom. vii. 4. <HI>Wherefore my Brethren, ye also are become dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth Fruit unto God.</HI></P>
<P>It is likewise compared to the <HI>Union</HI> of a Build|ing, whereof Christ is consider'd as the Foundation or chief Corner-Stone. Thus, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 4, 5, 6. <HI>To whom coming as unto a living Stone, disallowed in|deed of Men, but chosen of God and precious, ye also are built up a spiritual House, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contain'd in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief Corner-Stone, elect, precious.</HI></P>
<P>I might add, that this <HI>Union</HI> is sometimes repre|sented in Scripture by an Identify or Sameness of Spirit. Thus, 1 Cor. vi. 17. <HI>He that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>It is sometimes represented by an Identity of Body. Thus, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 12, 27. <HI>For as the Body
<PB N="352" REF="005572_0361_0000000000000000">
is one, and hath many Members; and all the Mem|bers of that Body being many, are one Body; so also is Christ.&mdash;Now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</HI></P>
<P>It is also represented by an Identity of Interest. Mat. xxv. 40. <HI>Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI>&mdash;Christ and Believers have one common Father. <HI>Joh.</HI> xx. 17. <HI>I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</HI> They have one common Inheritance. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 17. <HI>Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Christ.</HI> And they have one common Place of eternal Re|sidence. <HI>Joh.</HI> xiv. 3. <HI>And if I go and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my self, that where I am, there ye may be also.</HI></P>
<P>From this brief and general View of the scrip|tural Representations of our <HI>Union</HI> with Christ, I now proceed to consider, something distinctly, what is the special <HI>Nature</HI> of this Union, and what we are to understand by it. Now it may not be im|proper, in the first Place, to consider it <HI>negatively,</HI> and say what it is <HI>not,</HI> before I enter upon an affirmative Explication and Illustration of it.</P>
<P>I need not take any Pains to convince you, that this <HI>Union</HI> is not an <HI>essential</HI> or <HI>personal</HI> Union.&mdash;The <HI>Union</HI> of the Trinity in the Godhead, is essential: The <HI>Union</HI> of the divine and human Nature in Christ, is personal. But it were Blasphemy, to suppose either of these Kinds of <HI>Union,</HI> in the Case before us. Should we suppose the former, we should attribute divine Perfection to our selves. Should we suppose the latter, we should make our selves Joint-Mediators of the Covenant, with the glorious Redeemer. Either of which are too hor|ribly
<PB N="353" REF="005572_0362_0000000000000000">
profane, to find any Admission into our Minds.&mdash;Though Christ and Believers are one, as He and the Father are one, this is to be understood with Respect to the Resemblance there is, in Point of Reality and Nearness of <HI>Union;</HI> and not with Respect to the Nature and Kind of it.</P>
<P>It is likewise unnecessary to endeavour to prove to you, that this <HI>Union</HI> is not of the same Kind with those <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>local</HI> Unions, with which we are acquainted.&mdash;Tho' the Word UNION is apt to carry away our Minds into an Imagination of a Contact, Mixture, Inhesion, or the like, we are to remember, that these are too gross and low Con|ceptions of this astonishing Mystery, to be enter|tain'd by us. We are to remember, that our <HI>Union</HI> is to Him, who <HI>is by the right Hand of God exalted,</HI> and who is <HI>sat down on the right Hand of the Majesty on high.</HI></P>
<P>These Things need not be insisted upon; the mere proposing of 'em compels your Assent. But it seems there is another Thing requires more par|ticular Consideration, which is, that the <HI>Union</HI> I am treating of, is not to be consider'd as a mere <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Union.&mdash;It is thro' Want of a right View of this Gospel-Mystery, that you tell me, <Q>You <HI>can understand no more by our being united to Christ, than a near</HI> Relation <HI>to him as our</HI> Lord <HI>and</HI> Saviour;</Q> and <Q><HI>if there be any more imply'd in it than a relative and political Union</HI> (you con|fess) you <HI>have no Idea of it.</HI></Q>&mdash;I hope, Sir, your internal <HI>Experience</HI> has in this Case gone beyond your Speculation: Your State (I think) must other|wise be most dangerous and miserable. If you'll view the scriptural Representations, which I have already given of this Matter, you must see, that
<PB N="354" REF="005572_0363_0000000000000000">
there is much more, than a meer relative, civil, or political Union, imply'd in those emphatical Ex|pressions, of being <HI>one with Christ, as he is one with the Father;</HI> of <HI>abiding in him and he in us;</HI> of being united <HI>as the Vine and the Branches;</HI> of being so <HI>joined to the Lord,</HI> as to be <HI>one Spirit</HI> with him; of being <HI>the Body of Christ,</HI> and <HI>Members in particular;</HI> with others of the like Nature. It is impossible to give any rational Construction of these and the like Passages of Scripture, upon the Supposition of a mere political <HI>Union.</HI>&mdash;And you must acknow|ledge, that a political or relative <HI>Union</HI> is not pe|culiar to Believers. <HI>All Power is given to Christ, both in Heaven and Earth.</HI> Angels, Men, and De|vils are in this Sense <HI>united</HI> under the Kingdom and Government of the Lord Jesus Christ; and shall accordingly be all accountable to him, in the Day of Retribution. This therefore cannot be the Meaning of the <HI>Union</HI> in Question.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to consider <HI>affirmatively</HI> (ac|cording to the Light given us in the Scripture) what the Nature of this <HI>Union</HI> is. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It must be consider'd as a <HI>mystical</HI> Union. <HI>This</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>is a great Mystery.</HI> Eph. v. 32. So great, as to admit of no clear and full Illustration, at least in this imperfect State. From whence we have a further Evidence, that it is not a mere relative and political <HI>Union,</HI> in which there is nothing mysterious, Nothing but what is familiar and easy enough to be understood; while the <HI>U|nion</HI> under Consideration, is altogether incompre|hensible.&mdash;The Reality and Certainty of this <HI>Union</HI> is clearly revealed, and the blessed Effects of it are experienced by all the Children of God: but the <HI>Manner</HI> of it (like the Divine Person, God in|carnate,
<PB N="355" REF="005572_0364_0000000000000000">
to whom we are united) is not only above our Knowledge, but above our Search and Inquiry. This may perhaps be Matter of Prejudice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Minds of some, against the Doctrine before us, that it is inscrutable and unintelligible: But the same Objection lies against the most important Articles of our Faith and Hope; and even against many undoubted Certainties in the Kingdom of Nature, as well as of Grace. There is the same Reason to doubt of the <HI>Union</HI> of the three Persons in the Godhead, of the <HI>Union</HI> of the divine and human Natures in the Person of the Son of God, and even of the <HI>Union</HI> of our own Souls and Bodies.&mdash;We may have Reason to believe, what our Reason cannot search out, nor inquire into: And when that is the Case, the more mysterious and unsearch|able is the Modus of any Thing, which God hath revealed, the more should it be the Subject of our Acknowledgement and Admiration. Thus in the present Case, because <HI>this is the Lord's Doing, and marvellous in our Eyes;</HI> therefore should we adore the wonderful Dispensation of Grace, and <HI>rejoice and be glad in it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I must also observe to you, that this is a <HI>spi|ritual</HI> Union. Such an <HI>Union</HI> whereby being join'd <HI>to the Lord, we are one Spirit</HI> with him. 1 Cor. vi. 17. By which we may understand, that Believers partake of the same Divine <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the same Divine Influences and Operations, with our blessed Mediator and Master: This Difference being ex|cepted, that we have only lower Degrees of the Divine Communications; but <HI>to him God giveth not the Spirit by Measure.</HI> We partake of the Rays; he of the full Sun of divine Light and Grace; and in him are <HI>all the Treasures</HI> of Grace, as in the Re|pository

or Fountain, from whence we derive those Supplies, which we are Partakers of.&mdash;The blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> who is in Christ an infinite Fountain of all Grace, communicates some Emanations of the same Grace to us, whereby we are (tho' in a low and im|perfect Degree) conform'd to the divine Will, made <HI>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI> have <HI>Christ dwelling in us,</HI> and <HI>we in him.</HI>&mdash;I confess, I am afraid, in this mysterious Depth of divine Wisdom and Grace, of <HI>darkening Counsel by Words without Knowledge.</HI> I shall therefore not adventure to inquire into the Modality of this <HI>Unity of Spirit</HI> in Christ and Be|lievers; but only endeavour to consider it in a scriptural and practical Light: in such a Light, as it is necessary it should be consider'd and under|stood, by all that would obtain a sure Foundation of Hope, and needed Supplies of Grace and Strength, for a holy and spiritual Walk with God.</P>
<P>Let it then be first observ'd, that by this <HI>Union</HI> Believers have all needful <HI>Supplies of Grace</HI> treasur|ed up for them <HI>in Christ.</HI> In which Respect, it is said, <HI>All Things are theirs: for they are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 21, 23.&mdash;IN <HI>Christ are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge: and we are compleat IN him, who is the Head of all Principa|lity and Power.</HI> Col. ii. 3, 10. By which Means Be|lievers are <HI>blessed with all spiritual Blessings in hea|venly Places IN Christ.</HI> Eph. i. 3. And <HI>Christ is made of God unto them Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> 1. Cor. i. 30.&mdash;By these and other like Texts of Scripture, Believers have Matter of great Consolation, even in their sharpest Temptations and lowest Frames; in that how dead soever their Affections may be, and how dark so|ever their Circumstances may appear, they have an
<PB N="357" REF="005572_0366_0000000000000000">
inexhaustible Fountain of Grace treasured up for 'em in Christ; and by Virtue of their <HI>Union</HI> to him, they have an Interest in his Person, they have an Inter|est in his Graces, and are secure of all necessary Communications of Grace as he shall see their Case require.&mdash;The Believer's Refuge therefore, in all his Trials, in all his prevailing Darkness, Deadness, Temptation and Imperfection, is to act Faith in Christ, for Grace to help in Time of Need. There is a sufficient Stock laid up for him in the Hands of Christ; and if he will reach forth the Hand of the Soul, and by a believing View of the Fulness of Christ be ready to receive, he shall surely find the <HI>Grace of Christ sufficient for him;</HI> and <HI>the Strength of Christ made perfect in his Weakness.</HI> If he will <HI>eat Christ's Flesh and drink his Blood,</HI> that is, if he will exercise a lively Faith in him, he shall by Vir|tue of this Communication of the Spirit of Grace, <HI>dwell in Christ and Christ in him.</HI> Joh. vi. 56.</P>
<P>Hence also Believers by being <HI>joined to the Lord, are one Spirit</HI> with him in another Respect. They <HI>have the same Mind in them, that is in Christ Jesus.</HI>&mdash;They have the Interest of the Redeemer's King|dom at Heart, as their own Interest.&mdash;They have their Wills in some measure subjected to the Will of Christ.&mdash;They <HI>who abide in him,</HI> do carefully endeavour <HI>to walk even as he walked,</HI> to make him their Exemplar, in the Regulation of their Affec|tions, Appetites, Passions, and of their whole Conduct and Conversation; in their Aims, Desires, Delights, Love to, and Zeal for the Service of God, in Love to the Brethren; and in their Diligence and Activity in doing the Work he has appointed them, while it is Day.&mdash;<HI>He that</HI> thus <HI>keepeth his Com|mandments, dwelleth in Christ and Christ in him: and

<P>And hence Believers shall finally be <HI>perfected,</HI> when they come to receive the full Communicati|ons of his Grace, in the future World&mdash;It is by their Union to Christ, and Supplies derived from the Fulness which is in him, that glorified Saints at|tain to the Perfection of Knowledge and Grace.

<P>Here, Sir, it will be proper to make a Pause; and to consider this with a special Application to your own State.&mdash;It is proper to consider, <HI>where</HI> it is that you are looking for Supplies of Grace; to your own good Purposes and Endeavours, to your Prayers, Meditations, good Affections, and Resolu|tions; or to this inexhaustible Treasury of Grace, that there is in <HI>Christ,</HI> to be obtain'd by the renew|ed

At least, whether you are groaning under the Burden of your Imperfec|tions; and groaning after the quickning Influences of the divine Spirit in your Soul, to bring and keep you nearer to God; and whether the <HI>Spirit does</HI> thus <HI>help your Infirmities, with Groanings which cannot be attered.</HI>&mdash;It is proper to consider, whether you have the Evidence of your <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, by your being a <HI>Partaker of the divine Nature,</HI> by your stea|dy Desire and Endeavour of Conformity and Sub|jection to the divine Will, by your having the In|terest of the Redeemer's Kingdom at Heart, and by keeping your Eye upon his glorious Example, that you may follow his Steps; and whether you are still looking to him by Faith, for his quicken|ing Influences, and for an Interest in his Inter|cession, whensoever you find your self come short in these Attainments.&mdash;You will pardon this Di|gression, when you consider by what Motive it is occasioned.

<PB N="360" REF="005572_0369_0000000000000000">
of that <HI>Union</HI> to Christ under Consideration. I shall but briefly hint at a few Particulars more.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then there is such an <HI>Union</HI> between Christ and Believers, whereby the <HI>whole Church</HI> becomes the <HI>Body</HI> of Christ; and all true Believers are <HI>Mem|bers</HI> in particular.&mdash;<HI>He is given to be the Head over all Things to his Church, which is his Body, the Fulness of him that filleth all in all.</HI> Eph. i. 22, 23. <HI>Now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 27. <HI>Of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named.</HI> Eph. iii. 15.&mdash;The whole Church, whether militant or triumphant, are by their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ one Church, one Family, and one Body, whereof Christ himself is the Head. The Family in Heaven indeed, as adult Children, have their Inheritance in Possession, while the Fa|mily on Earth as Minors in their Non-age, have only necessary Supplies for their Support, Comfort and Growth, 'till they come unto <HI>a perfect Man, unto the Measure of the Stature of the Fulness of Christ.</HI> But then the Fulness of the Glory in the one, and the gradual Progress of Grace in the other, are both the Product of their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ. And as the whole Church is the Body of Christ, so each particular Believer is a Member of that Body; and hath both his Body and Soul united unto the Person of Christ; by an <HI>Union</HI> that can never be dissolved, by an <HI>Union</HI> that will not only continue with the Soul, in its separate and intermediate State: but will also continue with the Body, in its State of Dissolution, whereby its glorious Resurrection and final Renovation will be secured; and <HI>them which sleep IN Jesus, will God being with him.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This <HI>Union</HI> is such, that Christ and Believers have <HI>one common Interest.</HI>&mdash;I have hinted at this be|fore:
<PB N="361" REF="005572_0370_0000000000000000">
but it requires some more particular Illustra|tion. It should then be observ'd, that in the great Design of reconciling Sinners to God, and pre|paring a chosen Number for eternal Glory, Christ and the Church were one mystical Person: so One, that what he did was imputed to them, as if done by them; and what they deserved was imputed to him, as if he had been personally obnoxious.&mdash;Thus the Lord Jesus Christ is called <HI>the</HI> LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. Jer. xxiii. 6. And the Church by Virtue of this <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, is consider'd as the same Person, and has the same Characters ascribed to her. <HI>This is the Name where|with SHE shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.</HI> Jer. xxxiii. 16.&mdash;This Identity of Person was founded on the eternal Covenant of Redemption. The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>was foreordain'd,</HI> to the Office and Work of a Saviour and Mediator, <HI>before the Foundation of the World.</HI> I Pet. i. 20. And <HI>we were chosen in him, before the Foundation of the World; and predestinated unto the Adoption of Children by him:</HI> And thus <HI>we become accepted IN the Beloved.</HI> Eph. i. 4, 5, 6. And as he was foreordained to the Work and Office of a Redeemer, so likewise to all that Grace, Righteousness, Strength, and Glory required thereunto; not only to that which was peculiar to himself: but to that also, which was needful to be communicated to the Church, and to all that should ever believe on him, in their State of Pro|bation here, or Perfection hereafter.&mdash;And on the other Hand, as Believers were <HI>chosen in</HI> him, so they were chosen to be Partakers with him, in that com|mon Stock or Depositum committed to him, for both their present and eternal Interest and Happi|ness.&mdash;Thus the Obedience of our Lord Jesus
<PB N="362" REF="005572_0371_0000000000000000">
Christ becomes our Righteousness, his Sufferings our Atonement; and he is a Fountain opened, for all Supplies of Grace, upon our Union to him by Faith. <HI>He bore our Sins in his own Body, upon the Tree.</HI> I. Pet. ii. 24. And <HI>we are compleat in him.</HI> Col. ii. 10. Thus likewise, the Believer's Sufferings in his Cause are the Sufferings of Christ. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 24.&mdash;<HI>In all their Afflictions, he is afflicted.</HI> Isa. lxiii. 9. The Belie|ver's Graces are the Graces of Christ, owned by and derived from him; and <HI>of his Fulness they all receive, and Grace for Grace.</HI> Joh. i. 16. And the Believer's <HI>good Conversation</HI> is <HI>in Christ.</HI> I Pet. iii. 16. In fine, the whole Interest of the Church is the Interest of Christ, and is by him taken Care of, and provided for, as his own: And the whole Interest of Christ is the Interest of the Church; and the Believer is most nearly affected with the Interest of Christ's Kingdom, as what most nearly concerns him.&mdash;Thus is the Church united to Christ; and thus has he <HI>graven her upon the Palms of his Hands, and her Walls are continually before him.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Union</HI> between Christ and Believers is such as that they have thereby <HI>one common Rela|tion.</HI> He is their <HI>everlasting Father,</HI> their <HI>Head,</HI> their <HI>Husband,</HI> their <HI>Brother,</HI> their <HI>Friend,</HI> theirs by all Re|lations of nearest Intimacy. His Father is their Father, his Brethren are their Brethren; and his God is their God. <HI>Go to my Brethren; and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.</HI> Joh. xx. 17.&mdash;Thus are Believers distinguish'd from the rest of the World, dignified and exalted above all those who are es|teemed great and honourable among Men, by their near Relation to him who is <HI>higher than the highest,</HI> and is <HI>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="363" REF="005572_0372_0000000000000000">6. The <HI>Union</HI> between Christ and Believers is such, that they have thereby one common Inheri|tance.&mdash;They being <HI>Children, are Heirs, Heirs of God and Joint-Heirs with Christ.</HI> Rom. viii. 7. <HI>And if I go</HI> (says the blessed Saviour) <HI>and prepare a Place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am ye may be also.</HI> Joh. xiv. 3. There is Nothing can break the Band of <HI>Union</HI> be|tween Christ and Believers: the <HI>Union</HI> will not be dissolved, but perfected by Death. <HI>Neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things present, nor Things to come, nor Heighth, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to se|parate us from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI> Rom. viii. 38, 39.&mdash;This is the <HI>Hope of their Calling,</HI> This the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints,</HI> that when they have a little longer strug|gled with the Temptations and Imperfections, Dis|tresses and Calamities of this militant State, they shall arrive safe to the End of their Desires and Hopes; and <HI>be ever with the Lord.</HI> They shall be like to Christ, when they see him as he is. They shall dwell in his Presence; and partake of the Joys at his right Hand for evermore.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you a very brief and general View of the Believer's <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, according to the Representation of it in the Scriptures; and am now prepared to consider your second Question.</P>
<P>You next enquire, How <HI>"this Union is effected and accomplished?</HI></P>
<P>To this it is a sufficient Answer, that this <HI>Union</HI> is accomplished by the omnipotent Agency of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, as the Author and Efficient: and by <HI>Faith,</HI> as the Bond of <HI>Union.</HI>&mdash;Vain therefore are
<PB N="364" REF="005572_0373_0000000000000000">
their Pretences, and they have but a delusive and de|structive Hope, who ascribe all the Change in Con|version, to meer <HI>moral Suasion;</HI> or to the Exercise of our own natural Powers or Endeavours only. It is beyond the Power of Men or Means, to persuade a Sinner into this strict and intimate Union with Christ. It infinitely exceeds the Capacity of any such sinful Worms as we are, to make our selves <HI>one</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>as the Father and he are one.</HI> No! <HI>We dwell in him and he in us, be|cause he hath given us of his Spirit.</HI> I Joh. iv. 13. And <HI>by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body.</HI> I Cor. xii. 13.&mdash;Vain likewise is the Pretence of an eternal <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, or of an <HI>Union</HI> to him, from the Time of his Passion, or of his finishing the Work of our Redemption. For it is <HI>to them,</HI> and none but them, <HI>who receive him and believe on his Name,</HI> that <HI>he gives Power to become the Sons of God.</HI> Joh. i. 12. And <HI>Christ dwells in our Hearts by Faith.</HI> Eph. iii. 17.&mdash;The blessed Spirit shining with a Ray of divine Light into the Soul of a Sin|ner, thereby discovers to him his own Misery and Impotence; and shews him the Fulness and Ex|cellency of Christ, the Freeness of the Gospel. Offer, the Faithfulness of the Promises; and the Readiness of this precious Saviour to accept and save such guilty perishing Sinners as he is. This divine Light enkindles the Sinner's Desires after Christ, represents him worthy to be chosen and trusted; by which his Will is brought into a hearty Compliance with the Gospel-Offer. Thus this ad|mirable Union is accomplished. Thus by the om|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ipotent Power of divine Grace, the Sinner is drawn to Christ and made one with him, in a Way most agreeable and delightful to himself, with the con|curring

Act of his own Will; and with his full and free Consent and Choice.</P>
<P>I now proceed unto your third Question; <Q><HI>Of what Necessity or Usefulness unto</HI> practical Godli|ness, <HI>is it, that we should have a just Acquaintance with this Doctrine of our Union to Jesus Christ?</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Answer to this, I must observe, that I have already something anticipated this Enquiry. You may perceive by what has been already said upon this Subject, that it is not a Point of mere unneces|sary Speculation, of no Use or Influence upon pra|ctical and vital Religion.&mdash;And I would now en|deavour to shew you, that this is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all practical Godliness; and that it is from Ignor|ance of, or Inattention to this Foundation of our Practice and Hope, that so many dangerous Errours have obtained in the Christian Church.&mdash;This may be represented to you in the first Place, by consi|dering this Matter with a special Application to the Subject, upon which I have lately written so particularly and largely to you.</P>
<P>I am first then to shew you, that our <HI>Justification</HI> before God does necessarily and immediately de|pend upon our vital <HI>Union</HI> to Jesus Christ.&mdash;It must be confessed by all Men, who know any Thing of human Nature, and have any Belief of a divine Revelation, that <HI>we have all sinned;</HI> and that <HI>we are all become guilty before God.</HI> And which Way shall guilty Sinners be reconciled to God?&mdash;This, Sir, is the most important Concern in the World. Con|sider the Question, with an Attention worthy of its infinite Consequence.&mdash;Can you quiet your Consci|ence, with Hopes of appeasing the divine Justice by your Reformations, good Endeavours, or Duties? Alas they are all so defective and sinful, that the
<PB N="366" REF="005572_0375_0000000000000000">
Iniquity of your holy Things will greatly increase the Score; and add to the Weight of your Guilt.&mdash;Will you flatter your Hopes, from the Mercy and Goodness of the divine Nature? But what Claim can you have to Mercy, when open to the in|exorable Demands of Justice!&mdash;Do you expect Ac|ceptance with God upon Christ's Account? This is indeed a sure Foundation of Hope, for all who are interested in Christ and united to him. But what Pretence can you make to the Righteousness of Christ and the Benefits of his Redemption, if you have no Interest in him; or in any of his saving Benefits.&mdash;If you have an Interest in him, you are united to him, as I have already demonstrated. If you have not an Interest in him, you have no Plea to make for Justification and Acceptance with God upon his Account. Our Lord Jesus Christ has in|deed made a sufficient At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nement for Sin. He has wrought out a perfect Righteousness for Sin|ners, whereby they may be acquitted from Guilt, reconciled to God; and freely justified in his Sight. But what is this to impenitent Unbelievers, who have never been drawn to Christ by the powerful Influences of his Holy Spirit, who have never re|ceived him by Faith, so have never belong'd to him; and therefore could never have any Part in either his active or passive Obedience. <HI>If a Man abide not in me</HI> (says our blessed Lord) <HI>he is cast forth as a Branch and is withered; and Men gather them, and cast them into the Fire, and they are burned.</HI> Joh. xv. 6.&mdash;This therefore is a sufficient Evidence of the Truth of what I have before written to you upon the Doctrine of Justification. We cannot be justified by Works. We cannot be justified by a Conformity to any imaginary Law of Grace,
<PB N="367" REF="005572_0376_0000000000000000">
without a vital <HI>Union</HI> to Christ by Faith. For <HI>he that believeth not is condemned already.</HI> Joh. iii. 18. And <HI>he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</HI> 1 Joh. v. 12.&mdash;But then on the other Hand, being united to his Person, we are united to his Benefits; and partake with him in all the Merits of his Obe|dience, in his Righteousness, Victories, Graces, and Inheritance.&mdash;This then shews you, what Ne|cessity there is of your Acquaintance with the Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ. There is a Ne|cessity of it, that you may know what is the Foun|dation of your eternal Hope, how you may find Acceptance with God, and how <HI>you may know Christ, and the Power of his Resurrection, and the Fel|lowship of his Sufferings; and be made conformable to his Death.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, our <HI>Sanctification</HI> does likewise imme|diately and necessarily depend upon a vital <HI>Union</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ.&mdash;The Scriptures do indeed exhort us <HI>to be holy, as our Father which is in Heaven is holy;</HI> and to that End exhort us, to <HI>watch and pray,</HI> to <HI>crucify our Flesh with its Affecti|ons and Lusts,</HI> to <HI>mortify our Members which are upon Earth;</HI> and to <HI>place our Affections upon Things that are above;</HI> and to the like Exercises of religious Duty. But they no where exhort us to attempt these in our own Strength; or to expect a renew|ed Nature by any Performance of them within our Power.&mdash;To attempt our Sanctification merely by our own Endeavours, were to press Oyl out of a Flint. For <HI>in the Lord, shall Men say, we have Righteousness and Strength: his Grace</HI> and that only <HI>is sufficient for us;</HI> and <HI>without him we can do No|thing.</HI>&mdash;I have shewn you, that all Supplies of Grace are treasured up in Christ for us; and that we are
<PB N="368" REF="005572_0377_0000000000000000">
to receive them all out of his Fulness. How then can we partake of them, whilst estranged and dis|united from him? Can a Branch cut off from the Vine, bring forth Fruit? <HI>No more can we except we abide in him.</HI> Joh. xv. 4. Can the Branches of an Olive-Tree flourish, without the Root? Surely we cannot <HI>bear the Root: but the Root must bear us;</HI> and we must therefore <HI>be grassed in, if we would partake of the Root and Fatness of the Olive-Tree.</HI> Rom. xi. 17.&mdash;Can we live and act, when separated from our Life? <HI>Christ is our Life.</HI> Col. iii. 4. And until he quicken us, <HI>we are dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> Eph. ii. 1.&mdash;In a Word, our carnal Minds are En|mity to God, we are altogether as an unclean Thing: And when Love to God can be the Pro|duction of Enmity it self; and Purity and Holi|ness, of Nothing but Defilement and Uncleanness, then, but not till then, can we be holy without an <HI>Union</HI> to Jesus Christ.&mdash;If therefore, you would ob|tain that <HI>Holiness without which no Man can see the Lord,</HI> you must with active Diligence repair to him for it. You must by Faith depend upon him, as the Fountain of all Grace. You must receive all from him; and give him the Glory of all you receive.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Communion</HI> with God does likewise wholly depend upon our <HI>Union</HI> to Jesus Christ.&mdash;I have al|ready shewn you, that all sanctifying Grace is deri|ved from our <HI>Union</HI> to Jesus Christ; and I think, I need not use Arguments to prove, that we cannot exercise Grace before we have it. All quickning, comforting, strengthning Grace must derive from the same Source, as converting and sanctifying Grace does.&mdash;Would you be humbled and abased before God, you must learn <HI>of Christ to be meek and

lovely of Heart.</HI> Mat. xi. 29.&mdash;Would you have your Affections placed upon Things above, you must remember, that <HI>you are dead, and that your Life is hid with Christ in God.</HI> Col. iii. 2, 3.&mdash;Would you have Enlargement of Soul, and cheerful Hope in God's Mercy, when you approach his Presence. <HI>Christ in you is your Hope of Glory.</HI> Col. i. 27. <HI>In whom you may have Boldness and Access with Confidence by the Faith of him.</HI> Eph. iii. 12. And <HI>be accepted in the Beloved.</HI> Eph. i. 6. Would you enjoy the Earnest of your future Inheritance, it must be <HI>upon your believing in him, that you are sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of your Inhe|ritance.</HI> Eph. i. 13, 14.&mdash;Would you have Joy and Peace in believing, you must <HI>rejoice in Christ Jesus, without Confidence in the Flesh.</HI> Phil. iii. 3.&mdash;Would you have the Communications of the divine Love to your Soul, it must be from Christ's <HI>loving you; and manifesting himself to you.</HI> Joh. xiv. 22. To conclude, certain it is that without <HI>Union</HI> there can be no Communion; and it therefore concerns you not only to consider, whether you are indeed united to Christ; and have Access to God through Faith in him: but also, whether your Deadness, Formality, and Distractions in Duty, which you so often complain of, are not owing to the Want of a cheerful Dependance upon Christ, as the Head of Influences; or else to your vain Attempts to quicken your Soul by some Endeavours of your own, without looking to him for the Incomes of his Spirit and Grace.</P>
<P>I may add once more, Our <HI>Perseverance</HI> in Grace here, and out Perfection of Grace in Glory, do necessarily depend upon our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ.&mdash;As we are accepted in the beloved, so it is by <HI>Christ's
<PB N="370" REF="005572_0379_0000000000000000">
dwelling in our Hearts by Faith, that we are rooted and grounded in Love.</HI> Eph. iii. 17. <HI>We stand by Faith in him.</HI> Rom. xi. 20. It is because Christ <HI>lives, that we live also.</HI> Joh. xiv. 19. And if we do <HI>live, it is not we, but Christ liveth in us.</HI> Gal. i. 20.&mdash;We have no Source of spiritual Life, but in him: No Sta|bility in the Exercises of the spiritual Life, but by continual Supplies of Grace from him. It is because <HI>none can pluck us out of Christ's Hand,</HI> that we shall <HI>have eternal Life; and never perish.</HI> Joh. x. 28.&mdash;Here, and here only is the Believer's Stability and Security, he belongs to Christ, is a <HI>Member of his Body, of his Flesh and of his Bones</HI> and will the blessed Saviour neglect his own Body? Will he leave any of his Members to perish? Is it in the Power of Hell or Earth, of Sin or Satan, to prevail against him? Or can he who is the <HI>same yesterday to Day and for ever,</HI> change the Purposes of Love and eternal Kindness towards those whom he has once loved and united to himself?

<P>And now, Sir, you are to judge, whether there be not more than a doctrinal Acquaintance with our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ necessary for us, if we would either be justified in the Sight of God, obtain that Holi|ness without which no Man can see the Lord, live near to God; or <HI>hold the Beginning of our Con|fidence stedfast to the End.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. Wherein some <HI>Antinomian Abuses</HI> of the Doctrine of Believers Union to CHRIST, or Pleas from it for Licentiousness and Security in sinning, are consider'd and obviated.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALlow me the Freedom to tell you, that the <HI>Consequences</HI> you draw from the Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, as I have represented it, are without any Foundation; and that a just View of the Case must convince you, that this Doctrine gives no <Q><HI>Advantage to licentious and latitudinarian Principles,</HI></Q> but the direct contrary.&mdash;I shall therefore endeavour, according to your Desire, to consider the <HI>Antinomian</HI> Principles you are pleased to propose; and see whether they <Q><HI>naturally follow from what I taught in my last.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>You don't see</HI> (you tell me) <HI>if the Principles I teach are allow'd, how the</HI> Antinomians <HI>can be char|ged with Error, in supposing that the true Believer has no Cause to</HI> repent of his Sins, <HI>or to entertain any Disquietment of Mind with Respect to them, since he is</HI> united to Christ, <HI>and all his Sins are charged to Christ's Account, whereby he has satisfied for 'em all. Why therefore should the Believer be concern'd about a</HI> Debt, <HI>which is fully</HI> discharg'd?&mdash;<HI>Justice is satisfied with Respect to him; Christ delights in him, as a Member of his own Body; the Spirit of
<PB N="375" REF="005572_0384_0000000000000000">
God dwells in him, notwithstanding any of his Sins and Imperfections. Why may be not therefore be perfectly</HI> easy <HI>with Respect to Sin; and look upon it</HI> (as a modern <HI>Antinomian</HI> expresses himself) <HI>un|worthy of our least Regards?</HI></Q>&mdash;To this I answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. That no Man who is <HI>practically</HI> conform'd to this <HI>Antinomian</HI> Principle, can know himself to be a <HI>Believer;</HI> and therefore there can be no Founda|tion for this Reasoning, in any Person whatsoever. Were your arguing allow'd to be just, it can take Place with none, but those who have infallible Evidence of their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ; which it is im|possible any Man should have, who is not burthen'd with his <HI>Sins,</HI> who does not hate them, and groan after Deliverance from them.&mdash;<HI>Repentance</HI> is the genuine and necessary Fruit of a true <HI>Faith. They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn.</HI> (Zech. xii. 10.) <HI>That thou mayst remember, and be confounded, and never open thy Mouth any more, because of thy Shame, when I am</HI> PACIFIED <HI>towards thee for all that thou hast done, faith the Lord God.</HI> (Ezek. xvi. 63.) <HI>And ye shall be my People, and I will be your God. Then shall ye remember your own evil Ways and your Doings that were not good; and shall loath your selves in your own Sight, for your Iniquities and for your Abominations.</HI> (Ezek. xxxvi. 28, 31.)&mdash;It is the true <HI>Believer,</HI> and he only, that is capable aright to mourn for Sin, truly to hate it, and to groan under the Burthen of it. Unbelievers may mourn under a Sense of their Guilt and Danger: but this is not to repent of Sin. It is the Believer only, who sor|rows for Sin <HI>as</HI> Sin; who hates all Sin; who <HI>groans, being burthen'd,</HI> from a Sense of his Sinfulness; and who cries out with the Apostle, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this
<PB N="376" REF="005572_0385_0000000000000000">
Death!</HI>&mdash;What Room can there then be for those licentious Conclusions you speak of? <HI>Who</HI> is the Person that can thus rock his Conscience to Sleep, under the Prevalence of his Lusts, from the Doc|trine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, as I have described it? Must it be supposed to be one who <HI>is united</HI> to Christ; or one who is <HI>not</HI> united to Christ?&mdash;Surely not the former; for how can he be indolent, careless and secure in the Commission of Sin, from the Doc|trine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, who has no Evidence of this being his <HI>Case;</HI> nor can have any such Evi|dence, 'till he is <HI>poor in Spirit,</HI> and is thereby quali|fied for <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> (Matth. v. 3.) 'till he is one <HI>that mourns</HI> for his Sins, and comes under the Promise of <HI>Comfort</HI> (<ABBR>v</ABBR>. 4.) and 'till he is of <HI>a contrite and humble Spirit;</HI> for with such, and only with such, has the <HI>high and lofty One who inhabits Eternity,</HI> promised to <HI>dwell?</HI> (Isai. lvii. 15.)&mdash;And I think, I need not endeavour to prove, that he who is <HI>not united</HI> to Christ, has no Shadow of a Plea or Pre|tence to make for Carelessness and Security in Sin, from the Doctrine before us. Whence it follows, that all Pretences of this Kind are without any ra|tional Foundation. They only proceed from Men's Delight in <HI>Sin,</HI> in a Life of sensual Ease and carnal Security: and not at all from the precious <HI>Truth</HI> before us.&mdash;This sacred Truth may indeed be <HI>per|verted</HI> and <HI>abused;</HI> and so may all the other Doctrines of the Gospel. (2. <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 16.) But they who thus <HI>turn the Grace of God into Wantonness,</HI> do it at the Peril of their Souls; and will find but little Com|fort in it, when they come to make up their Ac|counts.&mdash;Whatever extravagant Pretences Men's licentious Dispositions may prompt them to, they must in the Conclusion find it true, that a Life of
<PB N="377" REF="005572_0386_0000000000000000">
continued <HI>Repentance</HI> of Sin, a Life of continued <HI>Self-Abasement</HI> and <HI>Self-Judging,</HI> and a Life of re|peated and renewed <HI>Mourning after</HI> Pardon of and Victory over our remaining Corruptions, is a ne|cessary Fruit and Evidence of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ; and belongs to the <HI>Way which leadeth to Life eternal,</HI> and in which the Saints walk to Heaven. If there|fore we would not too late be found with a Lie in our right Hand, we must, with <HI>Daniel, pray to the Lord, and make our Confession.</HI> (Dan. ix. 4.) We must, with the Church, acknowledge our selves <HI>as an unclean Thing.</HI> (Isa. lxiv. 6.) We must, with <HI>Job,</HI> even <HI>abhor our selves and repent in Dust and Ashes,</HI> (Job xlii. 6.) We must, with <HI>Ephraim, bemoan our selves</HI> (Jer. xxxi. 18.) And with <HI>David,</HI> have <HI>our Hearts fail us,</HI> on Account of the Number and Aggravations of our Sins, (Psal. xl. 12.) For these are the Characters, these the Dispositions of such, who are indeed <HI>united</HI> to Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is <HI>greater Guilt</HI> in the Sins of <HI>Believers,</HI> than in the Sins of <HI>others.</HI> They have therefore greater Cause to be humbled for them, and to <HI>la|ment</HI> 'em before God.&mdash;They are indeed united to Christ, reconciled to God, freed from all Condem|nation, and made <HI>Heirs according the Hope of eternal Life:</HI> The satisfying Evidences of which blessed State must carry them above any tormenting Fears of <HI>Hell</HI> and eternal Perdition; and deliver them from that <HI>legal</HI> Repentance, which is the Product of desponding Thoughts, and a <HI>Fear of Amazement.</HI> But is there no other Motive to <HI>Repentance,</HI> but slavish Fears of Hell? Does not a true <HI>Repentance</HI> and a genuine Sorrow for Sin, always flow from an affecting Sense of the Contrariety of Sin to the Nature and Will of God; from a Sense of the In|gratitude
<PB N="378" REF="005572_0387_0000000000000000">
there is in Sin, to a bountiful Benefactor and a compassionate Saviour; and from a Sense of the Dishonour to God's Name, the Violation of his Law, the Abuse of his Mercy and Love, the Affront and Provocation to his Holy Spirit, the Distance procured between God and us; and the Prejudice to others, as well as to our own Souls, occasion'd by our sinning against God.&mdash;Now in all these Respects, the Sins of <HI>Believers</HI> are more aggravated than the Sins of other Men.&mdash;They are distinguish'd from the most of the World, by renewing and saving Grace: and must it not cut them to the Heart, to think of their vile Ingrati|tude to such an infinitely kind and beneficent Friend; and of their horrid Abuse of such unmerited Mercy and Love!&mdash;They are united to Christ, washed in his precious Blood, and justified by his Righteous|ness; and can they be content to load him with Indignities, who has not thought his own Blood too dear a Ransom for their Souls; and who has by the Power of his Grace pluck'd them out of the Guilt and Danger of a perishing World, and made them Heirs of the eternal Inheritance!&mdash;They have felt the divine Influences and Consola|tions of the blessed Spirit; and have tasted that the Lord is gracious: and shall they by their Sins <HI>grieve</HI> the Spirit of God, provoke him to with|draw, and to with-hold his quickning and com|forting Influences from them!&mdash;They are the Friends and Children of God, the sworn Subjects of the eternal Majesty; yea, even the Spouse of Jesus Christ. And shall such make little Account of <HI>Sin!</HI> Is <HI>this thy Kindness to thy Friend!</HI> Is it a light Thing for a Child to rebel against his compassio|nate Father; for a Subject to take up Arms against
<PB N="379" REF="005572_0388_0000000000000000">
his Prince; or for a Wife to violate her Marriage|Vows?&mdash;Certainly the Sins of Believers are aggra|vated, in Proportion to the various Obligations they are under: and tho' they have no Cause of desponding and discouraging Fears, they have the greatest Cause to groan under the Burden of their Sins, and to groan after Deliverance from them. Their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ is so far from extenuating their Sins, that it renders them more heinous in the Sight of God; and is the strongest Reason why they should watch against them, lament and hate them. For this Reason, God may justly ex|postulate with them upon their sinning against him, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 6. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish People and unwise! Is not he thy Father, that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and established thee?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is true of <HI>Believers,</HI> as well as of others, that <HI>except they repent</HI> they shall surely <HI>perish.</HI>&mdash;They are indeed safe in the Hands of Christ; and <HI>none shall pluck them out of his Hands:</HI> He will <HI>preserve them to his heavenly Kingdom.</HI> But then, he will save them in his own Way, in the Way of a repeated renewed Exercise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> as well as Faith, and in no other Way. If any are not in that Way, they are not in Christ's Way: And have therefore Reason to suspect their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, and to conclude, that they are not in the Path of Life.&mdash;Their e|ternal Interest does therefore loudly call upon them, to mourn for their Sins, to hate and forsake them, left they perish eternally. True Believers will not indeed finally perish; for <HI>whom God justifies, he will also glorify.</HI> But then the Believer's Perseverance is subserved by a <HI>Fear of Caution;</HI> nor are there any true Believers, but <HI>penitent</HI> Believers: And
<PB N="380" REF="005572_0389_0000000000000000">
therefore, whoever are habitually careless in their Walk, and impenitent for their Sins, will fall short of Salvation, whatever Pretences to <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ they may make.&mdash;There is but one <HI>Way</HI> to Hea|ven; and whoever gets there, must attain the glo|rious Salvation, by obtaining Assistance, from the powerful Influences of divine Grace, to <HI>keep that Way.</HI> They must be enabled to go <HI>weeping and mourning, with their Faces towards Zion.</HI> They must offer to God <HI>the Sacrifice of a humble and contrite Spi|rit.</HI> They must <HI>loath themselves in their own Sight, for their Iniquities and Abominations.</HI>&mdash;Every other Road but this, leads down to the <HI>Chambers of Death.</HI> Believers therefore as well as others, have Cause to <HI>pass the Time of their Sojourning here in Fear.</HI>&mdash;They have not Cause indeed (as is before observ|ed) of a <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>slavish</HI> Fear: but they have Cause of a Jealousy of themselves, left they miss their Way and fall short of their Hope.&mdash;They have Cause to <HI>watch and pray, that they enter not into Temptation.</HI> (Mat. xxvi. 41.) They have Cause <HI>to keep under their Body, and bring it into Subjec|tion, left by any Means they themselves should be Cast|aways.</HI> (1 Cor. ix. 27.) And to <HI>judge themselves,</HI> that so <HI>they may not be condemned with the World.</HI> (Chap. xi. 31, 32.) They have Cause to <HI>follow Peace with all Men and Holiness, without which no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> (Heb. xii. 14.) They have Cause to <HI>repent and turn themselves from all their Trans|gressions, that their Iniquity do not prove their Ruin.</HI> (Ezek. xviii. 30.)&mdash;Believers themselves would <HI>fall into Condemnation,</HI> and <HI>their Iniquities be their Ruin,</HI> should they live careless, sinful, impenitent Lives. There is no Salvation <HI>promised,</HI> there is no Sal|vation <HI>possible,</HI> to any who live such Lives.&mdash;
<PB N="381" REF="005572_0390_0000000000000000">
They who are <HI>kept by the Power of God,</HI> are kept <HI>through Faith</HI> (an operative Faith, which is accom|panied with all the Graces of the blessed Spirit) <HI>unto the Salvation which shall be revealed in the last Time.</HI> (1. Pet. i. 5.)&mdash;The Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ does therefore allow no Plea for Licenti|ousness, since Christ is <HI>a Prince,</HI> as well as <HI>a Saviour,</HI> to all who are in him, <HI>to give the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Repentance, as well as Forgiveness of Sins.</HI> (Acts v. 31.)

<P>You go on to argue; <Q><HI>It appears a Contradiction, to teach, that the Believer is</HI> perfectly righteous <HI>in the Sight of God, by Vertue of his Union to Christ and by the Imputation of his Righteousness; and yet that he is</HI> sinful <HI>and</HI> polluted <HI>in God's Sight, at the same Time. If he be united to Christ and interest|ed in his Righteousness, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> righteous: And if he be perfectly righteous, he cannot be sinful; and therefore cannot have Cause to</HI> repent <HI>of his Sins, to grieve for them, or seek</HI> Pardon <HI>of them.</HI></Q> In Answer to this I would intreat you to consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this is to <HI>blend</HI> together <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Sanctification,</HI> as if they were the same Thing.&mdash;There is not the least Shadow of a Consequence, that because Believers are interested in a perfect Righteousness, and are thereby perfectly <HI>justified</HI> in the Sight of God, therefore their <HI>Sanctification</HI> is
<PB N="382" REF="005572_0391_0000000000000000">
compleat, and they perfectly holy.&mdash;God may <HI>blot out our Transgressions as a Cloud, and cast our Iniqui|ties into the Depths of the Sea,</HI> by a gracious Pardon, when yet we have Cause to acknowledge our selves <HI>altogether as an unclean Thing, and</HI> that <HI>if he should mark Iniquity, we could not stand;</HI> that <HI>if he should contend with us, we could not answer him one of a Thousand.</HI> And is that an Argument why we should be bold and careless in sinning, because God has been infinitely gracious in pardoning our Sin? Is it an Argument why we should securely and un|greatefully abuse our heavenly Father, because he has laid us under the strongest Obligations to love &amp; serve him?&mdash;But it seems to be the Drift of those whom you would personate in this Argument, that the Believer's Violation of the Law of God <HI>is no Sin,</HI> that their not being <HI>under the Law, but under Grace,</HI> makes it no Ways criminal <HI>in them</HI> to transgress the Law; and their being <HI>united to Christ</HI> legitimates even the grossest Transgressions both of the Law and Gospel.&mdash;If this be intended, I must observe to you, that in Order to a just deducing of this Conclusion, it must be supposed, that the <HI>Law</HI> of God is wholly <HI>vacated,</HI> and ceases to be a <HI>Rule</HI> of Life; tho' the Apostle assures us, that <HI>the Law is not made void by Faith, but established.</HI> Rom. iii. 31. It must also be supposed, that <HI>Holiness</HI> of Life is not required by the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ; tho' the whole Design of the Gospel is to promote Holiness; and we are expresly told, that <HI>the Grace of God which brings Salvation, teaches us, that denying Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World.</HI> Tit. ii. 11, 12. And it must even be supposed, that the <HI>Nature</HI> of the glorious God himself must be <HI>changed;</HI> that he
<PB N="383" REF="005572_0392_0000000000000000">
can <HI>look upon Sin</HI> with Approbation; and be <HI>pleas'd</HI> with what is most opposite to his own Purity and Rectitude. It must be supposed that <HI>David's</HI> Mur|der and Adultery, that <HI>Peter's</HI> denying his Lord, with Cursing and Swearing &amp;c. were <HI>acceptable</HI> to God. What Blasphemy, what Subversions of the very Light and Law of Nature are contain'd in such Principles as these!&mdash;But you will say perhaps, that it does not obviate the Difficulty, to shew the In|consistency and Incongruity of these <HI>Principles,</HI> while the Question yet remains, whether they don't (how wicked soever) necessarily <HI>follow</HI> from my Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ.&mdash;To which it is sufficient Answer, that by vertue of a Believer's <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, his Righteousness is imputed, to an|swer the Demands of the Justice and Law of God; and thereby to reconcile the Believer to God: but not to legitimate his sinful Actions. It is to pro|cure him a Pardon for past Sins; and not a License for future Transgressions. It is to free him from the Guilt and condemning Power of Sin: but not to change the Nature, and destroy the inseparable essential Desert of Sin.&mdash;It is true, that the Belie|ver is hereby interested in God's Covenant-Mercy and Love; and therefore secure of a gradual <HI>Sanc|tification,</HI> whereof his Repentance, Hatred of and Sorrow for Sin, is a peculiar and principal Part. Whence it follows, that we <HI>must</HI> mourn for our Sins, repent of and hate them, in Order to evidence our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ and Interest in him; and not live contentedly in Sin from a vain Dream of our <HI>Union</HI> to him. There can be no such Thing in Nature, as an impenitent true Believer; and therefore all Con|clusions of this Kind are groundless and impious.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="384" REF="005572_0393_0000000000000000">2. It is a <HI>Fact</HI> most notorious, and admits of no Dispute, that Believers have <HI>not</HI> a per|fect personal and inherent Righteousness in the Sight of God; and therefore the Doctrine un|der Consideration affords no Handle for such li|centious Pleas, as you have suggested.&mdash;Christ's <HI>Righteousness</HI> imputed to us, it is true, is <HI>perfect;</HI> and therefore our <HI>Justification</HI> is perfect too by Ver|tue of our Interest in it, so that on that Account we have no Cause of any Disquietment and Uneasi|ness.

true Believers, who believe in Christ for a <HI>Pardon</HI> only; or that they are true Penitents, whose only Motive is the Penalty, and not the <HI>Turpitude</HI> of Sin, which should make us loath it, and our selves for it, tho' conscious of a Pardon.</P>
<P>You further observe, that <Q><HI>The</HI> Antinomians <HI>argue from the Doctrine of our</HI> Union to Christ, <HI>as I have proposed it, that the</HI> Sins <HI>of Believers do really</HI> belong to Christ, <HI>as the Sins of the Hand really be|long to the Head, unto which those Hands are united. Accordingly be actually</HI> bare our Sins, suffered for us, <HI>and</HI> God laid upon him the Iniquities of us all. <HI>The Sins that the</HI> Believer <HI>commits, do therefore truly belong to Christ; and not to the Believer himself. They are</HI> his Sins, <HI>not</HI> ours. <HI>They are already ac|counted for by him; and consequently are not now to be</HI> repented <HI>of by us.&mdash;You suspect</HI> (you say) <HI>that there are too many among us, which quiet themselves with such dangerous Pretences, while going on in sin|ful Practices; that these seem to found their erroneous Principles upon the Doctrine taught in my last: And you desire me to consider, whether they don't naturally flow from it.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There needs no other Answer to this, than to shew you, that our <HI>Sins</HI> are to be consider'd in a <HI>threefold Respect.</HI>&mdash;They are to be consider'd with Respect to their <HI>Pollution,</HI> or Contrariety to the Holiness of God; with Respect to their <HI>innate Guilt,</HI> or Contrariety to the preceptive Will of God; and with Respect to their <HI>Desert,</HI> or Relation to the Pe|nalty denounced against them by the Justice and Law of God.&mdash;It is in the latter Sense only, that our bles|sed Saviour <HI>bare our Sins,</HI> and was <HI>made Sin for us;</HI> and that our Sins are by Virtue of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ imputed to him, and esteem'd as his.&mdash;If
<PB N="386" REF="005572_0395_0000000000000000">
this be distinctly consider'd, the Case will appear most plain and evident.</P>
<P>If we consider Sin with Respect to its <HI>Blot</HI> or <HI>Pollution,</HI> it is the <HI>abominable Thing,</HI> which God's Soul hates. It is what he <HI>is of purer Eyes than to behold;</HI> and what <HI>he cannot look on</HI> but with Abhorrence and Detestation.&mdash;Now it were the greatest Blasphemy, to suppose, that our Lord Jesus Christ did in this Sense take our Sins upon him, so as to be polluted and defiled with them. He was <HI>holy, harmless, un|defiled; and</HI> (in this Respect) <HI>separate from Sinners.</HI> He was <HI>a Lamb without Spot and without Blemish.</HI> He was God's <HI>beloved Son, in whom he was well pleased.</HI>&mdash;In this Sense then, Sin belongs even to the Believer himself, notwithstanding his <HI>Union</HI> to Christ. The Pollution of his Sin was never trans|ferred to Christ. But every Sin he commits, pol|lutes and defiles his Soul, gives him new Cause of Humiliation and Repentance, new Cause to fly by Faith to the Blood of Christ for Cleansing; and to the Grace of Christ for the sanctifying, renewing and quickning Influences of his Holy Spirit.&mdash;Hence we find <HI>David</HI> complaining, that <HI>his Wounds stink and are corrupt, because of his Foolishness;</HI> that <HI>his Loyns are filled with a loathsome Disease; and there is no Soundness in his Flesh.</HI> Psal. xxxviii. 5, 7. And hence we likewise find him so humbly and earnestly praying, that he may be <HI>purged with Hyssop and made clean, wash'd and made whiter than the Snow.</HI> Psalm li. 7.&mdash;It is not the Privilege of Believers, that <HI>their Sins</HI> have less Pollution in them, than the Sins of others; or that they are less displeasing to God: But their Privilege is, that they being <HI>united to Christ,</HI> they have Grace given them to apply for Cleansing to <HI>the Fountain set open for Sin and for
<PB N="387" REF="005572_0396_0000000000000000">
Uncleanness;</HI> and that they have an <HI>Advocate with the Father,</HI> to make Intercession for them.&mdash;It is therefore certain, that all such who do not improve this Privilege, who do not repair to the Blood of Christ for Cleansing, but remain careless and se|cure in their Sins, were never yet united to Christ, never cleansed from their Filthiness: But are not|withstanding all their vain Dreams of an <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, liable to meet with that final Sentence, <HI>He which is filthy, let him be filthy still.</HI></P>
<P>If we consider Sin with Respect to its <HI>innate Guilt,</HI> or Contrariety to the Law of God, the Sins of <HI>Be|lievers,</HI> as well as others, are a <HI>Transgression of God's Law,</HI> a Contempt of his Dominion and Authority, a Repugnancy to his Nature and Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, a Dishonour to his Name, and an Injury to his Kingdom and Interest in the World; in all which Respects, they bring <HI>Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> upon the Souls of the Offenders, in Pro|portion to the Nature and Aggravations of the Transgressions.&mdash;Now I hope, none will be so dar|ingly blasphemous, as to suppose, that our Sins are in this Respect transferred to Christ; that the blessed Saviour of the World has transgressed the Law of God, or dishonour'd his holy Name. <HI>For he did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth. He always did those Things which pleased his heavenly Father.</HI>&mdash;There is no Possibility from the Nature of Things, that the innate Guilt of Sin, or the <HI>Reat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Culpae</HI> (as the Schools express it) can be transfer|red from one Person to another. Whoever repre|sents the Person of the Offender, and as his Sure|ty bears the Punishment he deserved; yet the ori|ginal Guilt, the Obliquity, the Enormity, Fault or Crime of the Offence, lies at the Offender's Door; and can lie no where else.&mdash;Whence it follows,
<PB N="388" REF="005572_0397_0000000000000000">
that the Believer's Union to Christ can no Way change the Nature of his sinful Actions, and make that guiltless and innocent, whilst repugnant to the Nature and Law of God. Though it deliver from the Penalty, it can't remove the native Enormity of Sin: it still remains, and can't but remain abo|minable to God, and worthy of eternal Death. Whence God is displeased with Believers, when they sin against him. <HI>The Thing that</HI> David <HI>had done, displeased the Lord.</HI> (1 Sam. xi. 27.) <HI>The Lord was angry with</HI> Moses. (Deut. iv. 21.) <HI>He was very angry with</HI> Aaron. (Deut. ix. 20.) Though he be a Father, he is a provoked Father, when his Children <HI>forsake his Law, and walk not in his Judg|ments;</HI> and therefore he <HI>visits their Transgression with the Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes;</HI> tho' <HI>he don't utterly take away his Loving-Kindness from them; nor suffer his Faithfulness to fail.</HI> (Psalm lxxxix. 30, 31, 32.) Have not Believers therefore Cause to be deeply affected with their Sins, to la|ment them before God; and penitently to fly to the Blood of Christ for Pardon, when they render them guilty in the Sight of God, are provoking and displeasing to him; and justly deserve his eternal Wrath?</P>
<P>But if we proceed in the last Place, to consider Sin with Respect to its <HI>Law-Desert,</HI> or Demerit with Regard to the <HI>Penalty</HI> annexed to it, by the Justice and Law of God, in this Sense Christ <HI>bare our Sins,</HI> for us; and took upon him all the Iniquities of those, who are interested in and united to him.&mdash;<HI>He bare our Sins in his own Body upon the Tree:</HI> that is, he bare the <HI>Punishment</HI> due to us for Sin, when he offered himself a Sacrifice upon the Cross. <HI>He was made a Curse for us;</HI> and underwent the Curse
<PB N="389" REF="005572_0398_0000000000000000">
that was due to us. He was made <HI>a Surety of the better Testament;</HI> and so the dreadful <HI>Debt</HI> was transferred, from the principal Debtors, to him; and he being <HI>a Surety for Strangers,</HI> was made to <HI>smart for it.</HI>&mdash;Thus Believers partake of the Blessedness ascribed to him, <HI>whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin is covered; and unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity.</HI> And <HI>there is now no Condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus.</HI> They are acquitted from the Guilt of all their former Sins, upon their exerci|sing Faith in Christ. <HI>Thro' Faith in his Blood, Christ's Righteousness is declared, for the Remission of</HI> their <HI>Sins</HI> THAT ARE PAST. Rom. iii. 25.&mdash;But how will their State of Justification be continued, and their Sins pardon'd, but in the Way of renewed Exer|cise of <HI>Faith</HI> towards our Lord Jesus Christ, and <HI>Repentance</HI> towards God? How will they make any Progress in the divine Life, but by a renewed Flight to the Fountain of Grace, for new Supplies of spiritual Life and Strength?&mdash;From whence then can any Man fetch Arguments, for a careless Indifference about his Sins, unless he be also care|less and indifferent about the Favour of God, and his own eternal Welfare? <HI>Let no Man deceive him|self with vain Words;</HI> nor dream of <HI>any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.</HI> while he can sin without Care or Fear. For, <HI>because of these Things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of Disobe|dience.</HI> Eph. v. 5, 6.</P>
<P>You go on to argue, <Q><HI>If Believers are united to Christ, in the Manner described, so that his</HI> Obedi|ence <HI>to the Law was performed on their Behalf, and is become</HI> their <HI>Obedience, it then follows, that they have in Christ fulfilled the Law in all Respects; and it can therefore have no more Demands upon them;
<PB N="390" REF="005572_0399_0000000000000000">
and consequently they can be no more chargeable with Sin; nor have Occasion to be concern'd about it.</HI>&mdash;For <HI>where there is no Law, there is no Transgression.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Answer to this Objection, I shall first endea|vour to shew you, in what Respects our blessed Sa|viour has in our Place and Stead answered the De|mands of the <HI>Law,</HI> and thereby delivered the Be|liever from its Power and Dominion: And then proceed to shew, in what Respects the Law has still a Claim to the Believer's <HI>Observance,</HI> notwith|standing his Interest in and Union to the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Our blessed Redeemer has these several Ways fulfilled the <HI>Law</HI> for Believers. He has fulfilled all the <HI>penal</HI> Demands of it; and hath <HI>redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> Gal. iii. 13. We being guilty Criminals, the <HI>Law</HI> condemns us to deserved Punishment; and the Justice of God demands Satisfaction. The blessed Saviour has therefore stept in between us and the avenging Justice of God; and has recei|ved the flaming Sword into his own Bowels. Jus|tice is satisfied; and the guilty Offender released; upon his acting Faith in this blessed Surety.&mdash;The <HI>Law</HI> does moreover require of us a perfect <HI>active</HI> Obedience, as we are rational and moral Agents; and accordingly the original Terms of our Accep|tance with God were, <HI>Do this and live. The Man which doth these Things, shall live by them. But cur|sed is every one, that continueth not in all Things of the Law to do them.</HI> Now Christ has in this Re|spect also answered the Demands of the <HI>Law.</HI>&mdash;He has <HI>fulfilled all Righteousness;</HI> and taken away the Power of the <HI>Law,</HI> as it is the <HI>Strength of Sin,</HI> as it is a <HI>killing Letter,</HI> and <HI>Ministration of Death,</HI> on
<PB N="391" REF="005572_0400_0000000000000000">
the Behalf of all that <HI>believe</HI> in him; that it no longer demands perfect personal Obedience as the Condition of their Acceptance with God. In this Respect Believers are <HI>not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI> Rom. vi. 14.&mdash;Thus Christ has perform'd a passive Obedience, to answer the Penalty of the <HI>Law,</HI> and an active Obedience, to fulfil the Precept of it, whereby Justice is satisfied, God reconciled, and the Believer made <HI>accepted in the Beloved.</HI>&mdash;I may add to this, that there is an infinite <HI>Merit</HI> in this twofold Obedience of our blessed Mediator.&mdash;He being an infinite Person, the Value of his Obe|dience was proportion'd to the Glory and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gnity of his divine Nature; and he has therefore by his fulfilling the <HI>Law,</HI> purchased all Grace here and Glory hereafter, for all who shall believe in him, and be thereby united to him.&mdash;Thus then, the Believers <HI>first Husband is dead;</HI> that <HI>they are loosed from the Law of their Husband:</HI> And <HI>they are become dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that they may be married to another, even to him who is raised from the Dead;</HI> as the Apostle argues, Rom. vii. 2, 4.</P>
<P>And now in Order to answer the second Part of my Promise, and shew you in what Respect the <HI>Law</HI> has still a Claim to the Believer's <HI>Observance;</HI> I must remind you of what I have formerly ob|served to you, that the <HI>moral Law</HI> is also to be con|sider'd as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Living, as the Standard or Di|rectory of our Conduct. As such, it is a Copy or Transcript of the divine Perfections, in particu|lar of his Rectitude, Justice, and Holiness; and therefore is immutable, like the infinitely glorious Nature from whence it was derived.&mdash;It is utterly inconsistent with the infinite Perfections of the glo|rious God, for him to give us a Rule of Life, con|trary
<PB N="392" REF="005572_0401_0000000000000000">
to what is contain'd in the <HI>moral Law.</HI> Should the <HI>Law</HI> in this Sense be abrogated and buried, the Holiness and Justice of God must be buried in the Ruins of it.&mdash;Now though our blessed Saviour has in this Sense also fulfilled the <HI>Law,</HI> he has fulfilled it to <HI>establish</HI> it, and not to vacate or destroy it. He has fulfilled it as our <HI>Exemplar,</HI> to give us a Pattern of Obedience, that we may walk in his Steps. He hath fulfilled it to glorify his heavenly Father, that in Imitation of him we also may glo|rify him, by bringing forth much Fruit.&mdash;In this Respect then, the Law retains its full Demand upon us. <HI>Do we then make void the Law by Faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.</HI> Rom. iii. 31. With Respect to the <HI>Law,</HI> as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Life, our blessed Saviour assures us, that <HI>it is easier for Heaven, and Earth to pass away, than one Tittle of the Law to fail.</HI> Luk. xvi. 17.&mdash;How vile and abominable therefore are those Pretences, that there remains no <HI>Law,</HI> to regulate our Conduct; that we are un|der no Bonds to Obedience, that we have no Law to transgress; and therefore no <HI>Sins</HI> to lament! Has the blessed Saviour shed his precious Blood, to open a Door to Licentiousness? Has he come to legitimate a lawless, careless, worldly and sensual Life? No surely, he came with a quite contrary View; <HI>to redeem us from all Iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI> Tit. ii. 14. The <HI>Law</HI> must certainly be either the Rule of our Conduct, while we live; or the Rule of our final Trial and Condemnation, in the Day of Christ.&mdash;Though our Conformity to the <HI>Law,</HI> as a Rule of Life, be neither an Atonement for our Sins, nor a Purchase of the divine Favour, nor the Covenant-Condition of our Pardon and Acceptance

with God: Yet it is in the Nature of Things, and in the Doctrine of the Gospel, the Believer's Path|Way to eternal Life. <HI>He that faith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar, and the Truth is not in him.</HI> I Joh. ii. 4. <HI>He that faith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as be walked.</HI> I Joh. ii. 6. <HI>Whosoever committeth Sin, transgresseth also the Law.</HI> I Joh. iii. 4. <HI>For this is the Love of God, that we keep his Command|ments.</HI> I Joh. v. 3. <HI>If ye fulfil the royal Law ac|cording to the Scripture, Thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alt love thy Neigh|bour as they self, ye do well.</HI> Jam. ii. 8.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, it belongs to you to consider, whe|ther the <HI>Antinomians</HI> have any Handle at all for their licentious Principles, from the Doctrine of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, rightly consider'd and understood. If no Man can have any good Evidence of his <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, without a <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Humilia|tion</HI> for his Offences against God, then no Man can have Reason to be easy and secure in sinning, from a Presumption of his <HI>Union</HI> to Christ.&mdash;If the Sins of <HI>Believers</HI> are by Vertue of their Union to Christ more <HI>aggravated,</HI> than the Sins of other Men, they have more Cause than others to lament their Sins before God, and to be deeply humbled on the Ac|count of them.&mdash;If Believers, as well as others, must repent of their Sins, or perish, they have then the same Cause, which others have to mourn for their Sins, and with the greatest Detestation to renounce and forsake them.&mdash;If Believers by Means of their <HI>Union</HI> to Christ, though perfectly justified, are yet not perfectly sanctified, but <HI>in many Things, doall offend;</HI> if Christ has not taken away the <HI>Pollu|tion</HI> of Sin, and personal innate <HI>Guilt,</HI> though he has born the <HI>Curse,</HI> and taken away the Penalty of
<PB N="394" REF="005572_0403_0000000000000000">
Sin from Believers; if the <HI>Law</HI> still remains a <HI>Rule</HI> of Obedience to Believers; and if their De|viation from, or Violation of that Rule, be of the Nature of Sin, and brings them under Guilt and De|filement, they have then Cause to be humbled for their Sins, to groan under the Burthen of them, and ardently to pant after Deliverance from their re|maining Body of Death.&mdash;All these Premises are (I think) fully proved; and the Consequences cannot therefore be fairly denied.&mdash;Whence it follows, that whoever quiet their Conscience with such vain Pretences, expose themselves to the dreadful Con|sequences of a licentious Life, Divine Rejection, and a Wrath unto the uttermost.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly answered your several Pleas, in favour of the <HI>Libertines</HI> of the present Age, by Reasonings, which can't fail of giving you Satis|faction, if duely consider'd.&mdash;You'll be pleased to bear with me, whilst I offer one Answer more, which will equally obviate all your Objections; and dis|cover them all to be groundless, unreasonable, and irreligious.</P>
<P>You will readily allow, if it be <HI>impossible</HI> from the <HI>Nature of Things,</HI> that any one who is truly <HI>united</HI> to Jesus Christ, should be habitually careless and at ease, indifferent and indolent in a <HI>Way of sinning,</HI> that your Objections are then all groundless, and without any rational Foundation. And that this is so, may be made abundantly clear and evident.</P>
<P>If a true and sincere <HI>Love to God</HI> be a necessary Consequence of our <HI>Union</HI> to Jesus Christ, and be also utterly inconsistent with those licentious Con|clusions, which you have mention'd; it will then fol|low, that it is <HI>impossible</HI> from the Nature of Things, that any one who is truly <HI>united</HI> to Jesus Christ, should
<PB N="395" REF="005572_0404_0000000000000000">
be careless, easy, and indifferent in a Way of <HI>sin|ning.</HI>&mdash;That all who are <HI>united</HI> to Jesus Christ, do habitually love God, and dwell in the Love of God, is expresly asserted by the Apostle, 1 Joh. iv. 16. <HI>God is Love; and be that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI> And it is also necessary from the very Nature of our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ. Being united to Christ, we shall partake of all the <HI>Graces</HI> of the blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> which are in Christ, as in a Fountain or Re|pository to be communicated unto us; as I have shewn you before, that this need not be insisted on.</P>
<P>Let us therefore proceed to consider, whether the <HI>Love</HI> of God be, from the Nature of it, <HI>compatible</HI> or <HI>consistent</HI> with a Carelesness and Indifference about <HI>sinning</HI> against him.&mdash;Can we <HI>love</HI> God, and be care|less and indifferent about affronting him, and load|ing him with Indignity, at the same Time? Can we <HI>love</HI> God, and yet be content to dishonour his Name, violate his Laws, and trample his sacred Authority and Attributes under the Feet of our Lusts? This can|not be, till Love and Hatred, Friendship and Enmity, become the same Thing, no Ways to be distinguish|ed.&mdash;Our Profession of <HI>Love</HI> would hardly be voted sincere by one of our <HI>fellow-Creatures,</HI> who should find us easy and indifferent about injuring his Inte|rest and Reputation, and loading him with Contempt and Indignity.&mdash;Does not the <HI>Love</HI> of God especially consist in a Desire of, and Delight in a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the divine Nature and Will? That they who <HI>love God, dwell in God and God in them;</HI> that <HI>as he is, so are they in this World.</HI> I Joh. iv. 16, 17.

Souls; and fit us for Heaven?&mdash;Is the Blood of a <HI>Saviour</HI> a light Thing with us, whereby we are ran|som'd from Death and Hell; and made Heirs of the future Glory?&mdash;Is the sanctifying comforting and quickning Influence of the blessed <HI>Spirit</HI> a light Thing with us, whereby we are brought near to God, enabled to maintain Communion with him, and are qualified for the eternal Inheritance?

And is there any Thing without this, which can give us any Scripture-Evi|dence of our Justification?&mdash;The <HI>Antinomians</HI> may pretend to evidence their <HI>Justification</HI> by their <HI>Joy and Comfort:</HI> But how come they by their <HI>Joy and Comfort,</HI> if they have not previous <HI>Evidence</HI> of their justified State? How can they <HI>rejoice</HI> in the Favour of God, before they have good <HI>Evidence</HI> of their Interest in it? <HI>Without</HI> this, their <HI>Joy</HI> is groundless, and is an Evidence of Nothing in the present Case, but their Willingness to deceive themselves. <HI>With</HI> this, there is no need of <HI>Joy</HI> for an <HI>Evidence,</HI> of what is already <HI>confirm'd</HI> by a much better Witness.&mdash;I therefore conclude, that as the Scripture no where makes, and as the Reason and Order of Things no Way allows, <HI>Joy and Comfort</HI> to be Evi|dences
<PB N="400" REF="005572_0409_0000000000000000">
of our justified State, we should see to it, that we clear up our Title to the divine Favour, by better Evidence. And what other can we possibly find, but what I am now pleading for? This, the Apostle assures us, is the proper Evidence, by which <HI>the Children of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil. Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin;</HI> and <HI>whosoever doth not Righteousness, is not of God.</HI> 1 Joh. iii. 9, 10. They therefore, who reject this Evidence, would do well to consider, <HI>whose Children</HI> they be, according to this Determination of the Apostle.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, our <HI>Union</HI> to Christ is so far from affording the least Plea for <HI>Licentiousness,</HI> that it should be consider'd as the strongest Argu|ment, and the most powerful Incentive to a humble, penitent, watchful, holy and heavenly Life.&mdash;Are we <HI>united</HI> to Christ? Are we <HI>Members of his Body, of his Flesh and of his Bones?</HI> Surely then we must derive vital Influences from such a Fountain of spiritual Life; and be <HI>Partakers of his Holiness.</HI> If we find not this blessed Effect in some good Degree, in vain are our Pretences to an Interest in Christ, or Union to him.&mdash;Are we <HI>united</HI> to Christ, and thereby made Partakers of his inestimable Benefits? Surely then it concerns us to endeavour to <HI>live answerable</HI> to so high a Dignity, and such an honourable Rela|tion. Surely it concerns us to testify our Gratitude to such an infinite Benefactor, by living to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace and Love.&mdash;With what Abhorrence therefore should such <HI>licentious</HI> Thoughts, as you have suggested, be entertain'd by all the true Disciples of the holy JESUS, as not fit to be so much as <HI>once named among Saints!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="005572_0410_0000000000000000">If you can have Patience with me, I would briefly offer one Argument more, in Favour of the Doctrine I have insisted upon; which must recommend it as infinitely preferable in Point of <HI>Safety,</HI> to either of the contrary Extreams.&mdash;By acting up to these Princi|ples of mine, you can be in no Danger, as to the future and final Event, since you will be <HI>built upon</HI> Christ Jesus <HI>the sure Foundation</HI> of Hope, and by Grace de|rived from him, bring forth those Fruits of Holiness and Righteousness, which must end in eternal Life.&mdash;If the <HI>Arminians</HI> are right, you also are right. For you have the same <HI>Sincerity,</HI> the same <HI>good Works,</HI> which any of them may have to depend upon for Justification and Salvation. And it can be no Pre|judice to your Salvation, that you obtain'd these in a Way of <HI>Dependence</HI> upon <HI>Christ</HI> only, as well as in a Way of <HI>diligent</HI> Activity.&mdash;If the <HI>Antinomians</HI> are right, you also are right. For you depend only upon Christ for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> as well as they; and it can no Ways be injurious to you, that you have insisted upon the Necessity of <HI>Holiness,</HI> as the Way leading to eternal Life.&mdash;But now, to turn the Tables, if they who plead for <HI>Justification by Works,</HI> are at last found in a Mistake; and instead of buil|ding upon Christ Jesus and the sovereign Grace of God in him, are built upon the <HI>Sand:</HI> Or if they who <HI>disclaim</HI> the <HI>Necessity</HI> of Holiness, are too late found in a Mistake, and sorted among the <HI>Workers of Ini|quity,</HI> what will become of their Hopes! How dread|ful will their Disappointments be!</P>
<P>That you may be found <HI>united to Christ,</HI> and may be built up in Faith and Holiness, with Peace and Comfort, unto God's heavenly Kingdom, is the ear|nest Desire and Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Containing particu|lar Advices and Directions, for a close and comfortable Walk with GOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU justly observe, that <Q><HI>according to my former Letters, a religious Life must be a Course of serious, earnest, and assiduous Application.</HI></Q> And you have therefore good Reason to be <Q><HI>solici|tous in your Inquiry, How you must</HI> give Diligence to make your Calling and Election sure; <HI>and how you shall find that</HI> Peace <HI>and</HI> Pleasure <HI>I speak of, in your Walk with God?</HI></Q>&mdash;But there is no Cause at all of any Apprehension, that you <Q><HI>shall weary me out, with the continual burthensome Tasks you are imposing upon me.</HI></Q>&mdash;Indeed, Sir, you can no Way gratify me more, than by putting it in my Power, to be any Way serviceable to your best Interests.&mdash;I sincerely thank you, that you are now giving me the Satisfaction, of proposing <Q><HI>some Directions for a close Walk with God.</HI></Q>&mdash;It's an Affair of the utmost Consequence to my self, as well as to you; An Affair too little consider'd, even by those of whom we must <HI>hope the better Things, that accompany Salvation;</HI> And an Affair, in which I have Cause with Shame to con|fess, that my Remisness has turned to my unspeakable Disadvantage.&mdash;Let us then, as in the Presence of God, resolve by the Assistance of his Spirit and Grace, not only to consult, but to practise such Methods of Piety, as may be likely Means to sweeten the Fatigues
<PB N="403" REF="005572_0412_0000000000000000">
of Life, prepare us to encounter the last Enemy, and give us a refreshing Prospect of our future Inheri|tance.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour (according to your Desire) to be plain, familiar and practical, in the Directions and Counsels which I am now to lay before you.</P>
<P>And here my Advice to you is,</P>
<P N="1">1. That you endeavour to obtain and maintain a deep Impression of this important Truth, that you have but <HI>one Business</HI> to do; and that every Affair and Conduct of human Life must be <HI>calculated for,</HI> and <HI>subservient to,</HI> that <HI>one great End</HI> of your Being. God has made us <HI>for himself,</HI> to glorify and enjoy Him. We are but <HI>Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth;</HI> and <HI>have here no continuing City.</HI> There is another State before us, a State of our everlasting Residence, a State where we must be unspeakably and inconceivably happy or miserable, to all Eternity. Our whole Work therefore is, to be <HI>pressing towards the Mark for the Prize of our high Calling;</HI> to be looking to, and preparing for, <HI>another and better Country, even an hea|venly.</HI>&mdash;This, I say, is our <HI>whole</HI> Business; and there|fore not to be enterprized as a secondary Concern; not to be crowded into a Corner, to make Room for more agreable Entertainments; nor to be attended only at our vacant Hours, when disencumber'd from our worldly Business and sensual Gratifications. <HI>To fear God and keep his Commandments, is the whole of Man.</HI>&mdash;You won't so far misunderstand me, as to suppose, that I am inculcating the Necessity of a <HI>recluse Life,</HI> wholly taken up in Devotion, wholly separated from the common Business and Society of the World. No! I am only recommending to you and to my self, a due Sense, that we are under Obligations, in Point
<PB N="404" REF="005572_0413_0000000000000000">
of Duty and Interest, to serve God, and thereby to promote our eternal Welfare, as well at one Time, as another; and as much in one Business of Life, as another; as much in our secular Affairs, domestick Concerns, Company, and Diversions, as in the special Duties of Religion and Devotion. Though these call for the more solemn Engagement of the whole Soul in their Performance, being immediately direct|ed to God himself; yet the other also are to be done in Obedience to God, and with an Eye to his Glory. So that we have but <HI>one Business;</HI> though we have a great many Duties of various Kinds belonging to it.</P>
<P>Resolve then, to engage in, and to endeavour to manage every Affair of common Life, out of Duty to God, with a spiritual Frame of Soul, and with a hearty Desire therein to <HI>shew your self approved unto God. Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI>&mdash;Consider therefore, that you have the same God to deal with, the same om|niscient Eye to observe and remember your Tho'ts, Views, Affections, Frames, Language and Behaviour, while conversant in the common Affairs of Life, as when upon your Knees in your Closet or Family, or in the publick Worship of God's House: And that the same upright Views, the same holy Desires, the same Faith in Christ, are necessary in the one, as in the other, if you would have them acceptable to God.&mdash;This Consideration duly impressed, is the true <HI>Philosopher's Stone,</HI> that turns all to Gold.&mdash;This will make every Thing serve as a fresh <HI>Gale,</HI> to waft us forward to our desired Harbour.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be solemnly careful to attend upon <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Or|dinances of God,</HI> without any Reserve.&mdash;The Duties and Ordinances of Religion belong to the <HI>Way,</HI> which
<PB N="405" REF="005572_0414_0000000000000000">
God has appointed us to walk in, in Order to our Salvation: and we must be found in <HI>his Way,</HI> as we would expect his Presence and Blessing.&mdash;Herein be therefore careful to have no Reserve. Let <HI>every</HI> Duty, whether of the Closet, the Family, or public Worship, be diligently and constantly maintain'd, each in its proper Season. Live in the Omission of none of them; nor let any ordinary Occurrence or Excuse divert and put you by, when the proper Sea|son and Opportunity calls for your Attendance on them.&mdash;You are under the <HI>same</HI> Obligations at all Times, as at any Times, to perform Duty; and to ob|serve <HI>all</HI> Duties, as to observe any. For they are all required by the same Authority; and to be perform'd to the same Object, and for the same End.&mdash;He therefore who lives in the wilful Neglect of any known Duty, does thereby turn his Back upon God and his Salvation. Herein then, the greatest Care should be exercised, that we may <HI>prove</HI> (or know and do) <HI>what is the good, and perfect, and acceptable Will of God</HI> concerning us.</P>
<P>You should also remember, that the Duties of re|ligious Worship are to be perform'd to an <HI>omnisci|ent</HI> and <HI>Heart-searching</HI> God; a God who can't be <HI>deceived,</HI> and will not be <HI>mocked;</HI> a God, who <HI>will be sanctified in all them that come night him,</HI> and <HI>who</HI> will highly resent our <HI>flattering him with our Lips, and lying to him with our Tongues, when our Hearts are far from him.</HI>&mdash;You should therefore be careful, by previous <HI>Meditation,</HI> to obtain a lively Sense of the infinite Perfections of the glorious God to be worship'd, of the Nature and Importance of the Duty to be attended; and to have your Affections infla|med and much engaged, when you come into God's
<PB N="406" REF="005572_0415_0000000000000000">
immediate Presence, in any Ordinance of religious Worship. You should <HI>keep your Heart with all Di|ligence;</HI> watch against, and carefully suppress every roving and wandring Thought, endeavour to retain a lively Impression of the divine Presence; and to keep up a devout spiritual Frame of Soul, while in the Performance of the Worship of God.&mdash;Our Transactions with God, in the Duties of religious Worship, above all Things call for the greatest Se|riousness, Watchfulness and Care. And all the Pains we can take in this Matter, will prove too little; we shall still have Cause to lament our great Defects; and to mourn after the Pardon of the <HI>Iniquity of our holy Things,</HI> through the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. Remember, that as you lie at Mercy, so you have a <HI>Mercy-Seat</HI> to repair to; and that you may <HI>sow in Hope.</HI>&mdash;It is true, that we neither have nor can have any <HI>Claim</HI> to the Mercy of God, on Ac|count of any Thing that <HI>we</HI> do or are able to do in Religion. <HI>Not for your Sakes do I this, faith the Lord God, be it known unto you, Be ashamed and con|founded for your own Ways, O House of Israel.</HI>&mdash;But yet it is also true, that the infinite <HI>Mercy</HI> of God is more than equal to all our Unworthiness, to all our Difficulties, and to all our Wants.&mdash;<HI>There is Forgiv|ness with God, that he may be feared; and with him is plenteous Redemption.</HI> And <HI>God is in Christ recon|ciling the World to himself, not imputing their Trespas|ses.</HI>&mdash;You should approach the Presence of God, not only with a most abasing Sense of your Sinful|ness, Pollution, and Unworthiness; and with most earnest Importunity for the Influences of his Spirit and Grace: but also with a humble <HI>Confidence</HI> in the Riches of his infinite <HI>Mercy;</HI> and with a supporting
<PB N="407" REF="005572_0416_0000000000000000">
<HI>Hope,</HI> that for his own sake and for his Son's sake, (though not for yours) he will accept, pardon, sanc|tify, and save you.&mdash;While you are entertaining hard Thoughts of God, giving into desponding Frames, and nourishing your distracting discouraging Fears, you are dishonouring God our Saviour, grieving the Holy Spirit, hardning your own Heart, and going further and further from Mercy.&mdash;Come therefore before God, self-loathing and self-condemning, yet not with a distrustful Dread: But come to him with Expectation and Dependance. Plead the Merits of his Son; plead the Riches of his boundless Grace; yea, plead your own Misery and Want before him: hope in his Mercy, and wait for his Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Review your past Life;</HI> and be as <HI>particular</HI> as you can, in your <HI>Repentance toward God,</HI> as also in setting all Things right with your <HI>Neighbour.</HI>&mdash;It is our Duty particularly to confess and lament our Sins before God; those especially which are peculiarly aggravated, or have been willingly and customarily indulged.&mdash;It is our Duty to make up all Breaches with our <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and to repair all Injuries we have done him, as far as possible.&mdash;It is therefore necessa|ry, to call our selves to an Account for all the past Conduct of our Lives, both toward God and Man.</P>
<P>Look back then to your <HI>early</HI> Age, and bring the Sins of your Youth to Remembrance. Confess them particularly, lament them before God, and lift up your ardent and frequent Petitions to him, that he would not <HI>remember the Sins of your Youth, nor your Transgressions.</HI>&mdash;Continue your View, to the <HI>successive</HI> Periods of your Life. Consider what Duties you have <HI>omitted,</HI> whether personal or relative; what Parts of instituted <HI>Worship</HI> you have neglected, or by
<PB N="408" REF="005572_0417_0000000000000000">
a careless, hypocritical, and trifling Performance, have slighted and profaned, whether in your Closet, in the Family, or in the House of God.&mdash;Consider what <HI>Relations</HI> you have sustain'd, and what have been your special Defects in each of them. <HI>Humble your selves in the Sight of God,</HI> on Account of them all: <HI>Cry to him</HI> for Pardon, in the Blood of Christ; and for Grace and Strength to serve him acceptably by a right Discharge of your respective Duties, in each Station and Circumstance of Life, as well as by a due Performance of the several Offices of Devotion.&mdash;Consider your many Sins of <HI>Commission,</HI> according to their respective Natures and Aggravations. Con|fess them before God; and confess the innumerable Multitude which were unobserved when committed, or forgotten since.&mdash;Endeavour to impress a just Sense of their Number, Enormity, and Guilt upon your Conscience, till you are forced to groan out that Language of a repenting Soul: <HI>Innumerable Evils have compassed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me, they are more than the Hairs of my Head, therefore my Heart faileth me.</HI> Endeavour to bring them <HI>all</HI> (those which you can remember, by a par|ticular Enumeration; those which you cannot re|member, by a general Confession) to the <HI>Fountain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness.</HI> Pray for Faith, and endeavour to <HI>trust</HI> in the infinite Merits of the Re|deemer's Blood, and the infinite Mercy of the God of all Grace, for a free Pardon of all your Sins, how extensive soever in their Number, how great soever in their Aggravations.&mdash;Thus endeavour to have your past Account balanced by the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>In like Manner be careful to review the Defects of the Duties, and the Violations of the Precepts, of
<PB N="409" REF="005572_0418_0000000000000000">
the <HI>second Table</HI> of the moral Law.&mdash;Consider whe|ther there be none who have offered you <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Indignities;</HI> and see to it, that from your Heart you forgive them their Trespasses, and that you remem|ber each of them at the Throne of Grace, seeking Mercy for them, as for your own Soul.&mdash;Consider what <HI>Differences</HI> and <HI>Controversies</HI> you have maintain'd with any Man; and in the most kind and conde|scending Manner attempt all reasonable Methods of Reconciliation, committing the Case to God by Prayer.&mdash;Consider whether in the Course of your Life you have not some Way or other been injurious to your <HI>Neighbour,</HI> by Word or Deed, in your Com|merce or Conversation; and never rest, till you have made Reparation and Satisfaction, if any Thing of that Kind can be remembered.&mdash;Consider whether there be no <HI>Enmity,</HI> or Rancour of Spirit, no Preju|dice or ill Will, harbour'd in your Breast against any Man; and never rest till you can feel an universal Benevolence to every Individual of the human Race, and have that <HI>Love</HI> in Exercise, which is the <HI>fulfilling of the Law.</HI>&mdash;Consider whether you have <HI>learn'd of Christ to be meek and lowly of Heart,</HI> to live in Peace and Kindness; and be excited by <HI>the Gentleness of Christ,</HI> to maintain the Exercise of those Fruits of the Spirit, <HI>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Meekness, Temperance.</HI>&mdash;Consi|der whether you have practised sufficient <HI>Liberality</HI> towards the Poor and Indigent; and consult how you may now so <HI>cast your Bread upon the Water, as to find it again after many Days.</HI>&mdash;And in a Word, seek Pardon through the Blood of Christ for all your past Defects; and consult how you may, for the future, render your self the most extensive Blessing to the World, while you live in it.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="410" REF="005572_0419_0000000000000000">5. Be very careful, faithfully to discharge the res|pective <HI>Duties</HI> of the several <HI>Relations</HI> you sustain.&mdash;God having placed you (Sir) in a Station of <HI>publick Trust,</HI> He calls upon you in the Language of <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">osha|phat</HI> to his Judges: <HI>Take Head what ye do, for you judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment; therefore now let the Fear of the Lord be upon you, take Heed and do it.</HI>&mdash;It would be Arro|gance in me, to pretend to direct you in the particular Duties of your honourable Station; and the parti|cular Methods of discharging them.&mdash;It is your Con|cern, in the Execution of your Trust, to approve your self <HI>a Minister of God to his People for their Good; a Terror, not to good Works, but to the evil;</HI> the Patron and Defender of the oppressed and injur|ed, and an impartial Restrainer and Punisher of the vicious and immoral; a shining Pattern of a regular Life; and one that <HI>seeks the Welfare of your People.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me further to observe,</P>
<P>As you are likewise remarkably blessed in your <HI>conjugal</HI> Relation, that a full Compliance with the Laws of <HI>Christianity</HI> will greatly add to your mutual Happiness.&mdash;I don't mean by this, to recommend to you that Love, tender Affection, and most oblig|ing Kindness, which the Word of God injoins upon all in that Relation; and which is so absolutely ne|cessary to all such, in order to their present Comfort or future Happiness: Since in these Things, you have practically declared to the World, that you stand in no Need of a Monitor.&mdash;But what I would particularly offer to your Consideration, is, that the <HI>Soul</HI> is the principal Part of humane Nature; and consequently the principal Object of Love and Re|gard, in that near and intimate Relation.&mdash;It should
<PB N="411" REF="005572_0420_0000000000000000">
therefore be the chief Care of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are thus nearly united, to live together as <HI>Fellow-Heirs of the Grace of Life,</HI> to assist, counsel, quicken and comfort one another, in the Ways of God and Godliness; and to consult all proper Methods to promote each other's spiritual and eternal Welfare.&mdash;Thus the Bands of Union and Motives of dearest Affection will be more than doubled. This will render such Per|sons Blessings to each other indeed; and lay a Foun|dation for Joy to all Eternity.</P>
<P>You are peculiarly favoured with Regard to a plea|sant and delightful <HI>Offspring.</HI> And upon the <HI>Birth</HI> of each of your Children, the Lord does (as it were) say unto you, as <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> Daughter to <HI>Moses's</HI> Mo|ther, <HI>Take this Child, and nurse it for Me.</HI>&mdash;You should accordingly take early Care, to endeavour the forming their Minds to the Knowledge, Fear, and Service of God.&mdash;You should not only teach them their <HI>Catechism,</HI> whereby a Summary of christian Doc|trines may be laid up in their <HI>Memories;</HI> but study in a plain, easy, and familiar Manner, to adapt your Instructions to their Understandings, and endeavour to acquaint them with the great Things of their e|ternal Peace.&mdash;You should endeavour not only to give them a doctrinal, but a <HI>practical</HI> Acquaintance with the Duties of Christianity; and as soon as pos|sible, put them upon the stated Exercise of religious Duty.&mdash;You should in the most kind and affecti|onate Manner possible, endeavour to restrain their vicious Inclinations and Practices, and instill into them Principles of Reverence to the Aged, of Honour and Gratitude to their Parents, of Kindness and Love to one another, and of Piety and Mercy to the indigent and distressed.&mdash;You should with constant and im|portunate
<PB N="412" REF="005572_0421_0000000000000000">
Ardour of Soul, wrestle with God for their spiritual Welfare; and even <HI>travel in Birth, to see Christ formed in their Souls.</HI>&mdash;This is the Way to make them indeed Blessings in their Generation, to make them happy while they live, happy when they die, and happy for ever. By this Means therefore, shew that you love them indeed.</P>
<P>To this I must add, that you are under a like Ob|ligation to take Care of the Souls of your <HI>Servants,</HI> as of your Children; and in like Manner to instruct them, and to impress upon their Minds the vast Con|cerns of Eternity. For you should always remember, that the Soul of your meanest Slave is of more Value than this <HI>whole World.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only subjoin under this Head, that you sus|tain the Character of a <HI>Neighbour,</HI> unto which are many Duties annexed.&mdash;The <HI>Poor</HI> you have always with you, to whom you owe charitable and compas|sionate Relief.&mdash;You have frequent Occasions of <HI>Conversation,</HI> which should be <HI>good to the Use of edi|fying, that you may administer Grace to the Hearers.</HI>&mdash;You have special Interest in and Influence upon many; this you should improve with Care, for their spiritual Advantage.&mdash;You will find frequent Occasion to exhort and to reprove others, which should be done with such unaffected Seriousness and Kindness, Con|descension and Humility, as will both touch the Con|science, and engage the Affections; and thereby have a Prospect of Success.&mdash;In fine, you should watch for Opportunity to do what Service you can, both to the Bodies and Souls of your Neighbours; and thereby fulfil the <HI>royal Law of Love.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Walk by <HI>Rule,</HI> in an exact Observance of <HI>stated Devotions.</HI>&mdash;We are exhorted to <HI>walk circumspectly,
<PB N="413" REF="005572_0422_0000000000000000">
redeeming the Time;</HI> to be <HI>always abounding in the Work of the Lord;</HI> doing the <HI>Duty of every Day, in its Day;</HI> of every Season, in its Season. And to time Things to best Advantage, to methodize Things well, and be steady to some certain Rules of proceed|ing, will very much befriend a Life of Religion.&mdash;We are counselled, to be <HI>in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long;</HI> to <HI>pray without ceasing,</HI> and to <HI>meditate in God's Law Day and Night.</HI> Nothing can be of greater Importance to our present or future Happi|ness, than a careful Compliance with these divine Precepts.</P>
<P>You should therefore <HI>begin</HI> the Day with GOD. When you wake in the <HI>Morning,</HI> let God have your <HI>first Thoughts.</HI> Lift up your Heart to him, with Thankfulness for the Preservations of the Night; and in Supplication to him for his Presence with you, in the Duties of the succeeding Day.&mdash;After such Ejaculations, before you rise from Bed, you will do well to consider with your self, what are the Duties be|fore you this Day, whereby God may be most glorified, your spiritual Interests best subserved, and you most useful in your Generation.&mdash;Whist arising from Bed and dressing your self, entertain Meditations upon Subjects suited to the Occasion, such as the Necessity of your Resurrection from spiritual Death, or the Cer|tainty and Consequences of the final Resurrection at the great Day of Christ's Appearing and Kingdom; the Necessity of your being cloathed with the Righ|teousness of Christ; or the glorious Livery, in which you hope to appear before the Tribunal of your Judge, when you shall shine as the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. These, or such like Me|ditations, a Variety whereof will readily offer to
<PB N="414" REF="005572_0423_0000000000000000">
your Mind, may be an excellent Means to put your Soul into a proper Frame for the Duties before you.</P>
<P>When risen from Bed, retire as soon as you con|veniently can into your <HI>Closet.</HI>&mdash;Read some Portion of the Word of God; mixing it with Faith, giving a close Attention, making devout Reflections, and occasional Ejaculations of Prayer and Praise, according to the Subject-Matter you are entertained with.&mdash;After reading, pause a while, and endeavour to affect your Mind with lively Impressions of the infinite Perfecti|ons of the glorious Majesty, before whom you are approaching. Lift up your Eyes to God, with fer|vent Aspirations after the Influences of his blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> to <HI>help your Infirmities,</HI> to <HI>teach you to pray,</HI> as you ought; and to <HI>make Intercessions for you, with Groanings which cannot be uttered.</HI>&mdash;Thus in the Name of Christ bow your Knees before God, with an aw|ful Sense of the infinite Distance between him and you, and of your intire Unworthiness of his Favour; yet with a humble Hope and Confidence in his in|finite Grace and Mercy in Christ: and keep up a strict and continual Guard over your Thoughts and Affections, that they don't wander from the Business before you, and render the Duty a meer superficial Lip-Service.</P>
<P>From your Closet proceed to the Duties of <HI>Family|Worship.</HI> Call your whole Houshold together; let none be absent. Read a Chapter in the sacred Bible: and I would advise you commonly to read in Course, that the whole Word of God may be read in your Family. Perhaps it may be an agreeable Practice, and most for Edification, to read in the old Testa|ment one Part of the Day, and in the New Testa|ment the other.&mdash;I would advise you to sing Part of

a Psalm; and then pray with your Family. Which done, gravely dismiss them, to their respective secular Occasions.</P>
<P>Having thus carry'd your self and Family through the Morning-Sacrifices, don't suppose, that you are now discharged from all religious and spiritual Con|cerns, until the Return of the stated Times of divine Worship; but <HI>keep your Soul diligently,</HI> study to pre|serve and cherish still a spiritual Frame.&mdash;Intermix frequent occasional Meditations and Ejaculations, with all the Business you are engaged in.&mdash;After <HI>Dinner,</HI> I would advise you to retire again into your <HI>Closet</HI> for some Exercises of Devotion.&mdash;Imitate <HI>Da|vid</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Frequency of your secret Re|tirements; and make it your stated Rule, <HI>at Even|ing, in the Morning, and at Noon to pray, and to let God hear your Voice.</HI></P>
<P>Chuse some convenient Time <HI>every Day</HI> for religi|ous <HI>Meditation,</HI> and <HI>Solemn Reflection.</HI> Daily spend half an Hour, at least, in this useful and delightful Employ|ment; and more, when your Circumstances will al|low it. Let the Time be stated; and let no ordi|nary Avocations prevent your duly attending upon this Exercise, at the Return of the appointed Season. Perhaps Experience will teach you, with the Patriarch <HI>Isaac,</HI> to chuse the <HI>Evening</HI> for this Service.&mdash;But this depends upon the respective Business and Cir|cumstances of Life, and Dispositions of Mind, of each particular Person.&mdash;The whole Word of God will afford you Matter for your Meditation; that you have a large Field before you, enough to keep you happily employ'd to all Eternity: But the Per|fections of the divine Nature, the astonishing Work of Redemption by Jesus Christ, the glorious Excel|lency

of his Person, and the wonderful Benefits of his Salvation, the incomparable Glories of the hea|venly World, the Preciousness of your Soul, with its various Wants, and the like, should be the most common, as they are the most important Subjects of your Contemplation.&mdash;Engage in this Business, as in the Presence of God, call in your Thoughts from every foreign Concern, and keep them closely enga|ged. Deeply <HI>muse, until the Fire burns:</HI> Meditate on divine and eternal Things, till they become real and visible to the Eyes of your Mind; even till your Soul is brought (if it pleases God) to the Top of <HI>Pisgah,</HI> and to a View of the heavenly <HI>Canaan.</HI>&mdash;But I need not insist upon the Methods of performing this Duty. By a faithful and steady Attendance upon it, your <HI>Experience</HI> will quickly teach you the best Manner of its Performance.</P>
<P>And now being brought to the <HI>Close</HI> of the Day, <HI>end</HI> it as you began it, with Respect to the Duties both of your <HI>Closet</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI>&mdash;And when you be|take your self to your <HI>Rest,</HI> review the Conduct of the Day past; and consider what Matter of Repen|tance, or of Thanksgiving, is thereby before you.&mdash;Solemnly interrogate your self, whether you are fit to <HI>die;</HI> and what your State is like to prove, if you <HI>this Night</HI> should awake in the eternal World. Your Answer to this momentous Question must either ex|cite your Diligence to flee from the Wrath to come; or animate your Love and Gratitude to God, and your Zeal for his Service, in Hope of the Glory to be revealed. To conclude, endeavour to improve your <HI>waking Minutes</HI> on your Bed (whether before you first fall asleep, or when you shall awake in the Night) in religious and divine Meditation.&mdash;So,

when you wake and rise in the Morning, <HI>still be with God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have set before you a Method of filling up your Time with Duty; with such Duties, as will every one of them tend to promote your Progress to eternal Bliss.&mdash;And I need now only further put you in Mind, that besides these daily Exercises of Religi|on, there are Seasons wherein the <HI>whole Day</HI> should be taken up in the immediate Service of God; ex|cepting when we are called off by Works of Neces|sity and Mercy.&mdash;Such is the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> which ought to be so strictly sanctified, that we should not so much as allow our selves to think our own Tho'ts, or to speak our own Words.&mdash;Such are likewise oc|casional Days of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> which the Scripture calls <HI>our Sabbaths.</HI> The frequent and devout Celebration of these Days may prove of emi|nent Usefulness to promote the Life and Power of Godliness.&mdash;The Scriptures do not indeed direct how often these should be attended. They are a Free|Will-Offering: And the State of your Soul, with the Dispensations of Providence towards your self, your Family, or the Church of God; and the re|spective Business, whether temporal or spiritual, which you have before you, will be a sufficient Direction, as to the Time and Manner of performing these Duties.</P>
<P>I would suggest here one Thing more: you would do wisely to keep an exact <HI>Account</HI> in <HI>Writing,</HI> of your daily Expence of Time.&mdash;Before you go to Bed, re|collect and record (at least in some brief Hints) the Business you have done, the Duties perform'd, the Mercies received, the Frames of your Soul, the Dis|pensations of Providence, with the Sins and Imper|fections
<PB N="418" REF="005572_0427_0000000000000000">
of the Day past. Let this be done so, that you your self upon a Review can understand it; though there may be some Occurrences requiring a Veil of Obscurity to be thrown over them, that they may not be understood by others, if ever your Pa|pers should fall into their Hands.&mdash;By this Means, you may have always before you, what special Re|formation is wanting, what special Obligations you are under to God; and what Proficiency you make in the School of Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7. Walk by <HI>Faith</HI> in the Son of God. Whatever you do, let <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ be kept in daily Exercise, and run through all your Duties, from first to last.&mdash;I have adapted my former Directions to that State of <HI>Suspence,</HI> which you are in, with Respect to your Conversio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to God. <Q><HI>You have some Times</HI> (you tell me) <HI>refreshing and encouraging Hope, that you have had some Experience of those Marks of converting Grace, which I have described.</HI></Q>&mdash;Be it then sup|posed (as I trust there is ground to suppose) that the <HI>Hope</HI> you have at Times, is well founded; in this Case, your Compliance with those Directions is the best Means of a successful and delightful Progress towards your heavenly Inheritance.&mdash;But you com|plain, that <Q><HI>You often conflict with distressing Doubts and Fears, that the Prevalence of your Corruptions, the Formality and Hypocrisy of your Duties, and the dead carnal Frames, which you feel in your self too frequently, are utterly inconsistent with well-grounded Hopes of a renewed and sanctified Soul.</HI></Q>&mdash;Were your Case indeed according to your Fears, what bet|ter Method could be proposed, than to attend the Directions here given, in Order to seek after the renewing Influences of the Spirit of God?</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="005572_0428_0000000000000000">But I must observe to you, there is one Thing that is eminently of Importance, and which seems yet wanting in Order to your maintaining a heavenly Conversation, and a comfortable <HI>Walk with God.</HI> To <HI>walk with God,</HI> is to <HI>walk in Christ;</HI> and to have <HI>the Life which we live in the Flesh, be by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> It is by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, that we have Access to the Throne of Grace. <HI>By whom also we have Access by Faith, into this Grace wherein we stand.</HI> Rom. v. 2.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, that our Persons and Services find Acceptance with God. <HI>Who hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</HI> Eph. i. 6.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, that our Corruptions are mor|tified, and our Hearts cleansed. <HI>Purifying their Hearts by Faith.</HI> Acts xv. 9.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, that we are enabled to tread the World and its Idol-Va|nities under our Feet. <HI>And this is the Victory that over cometh the World, even our Faith.</HI> I Joh. v. 4.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith,</HI> that we enjoy the Consolations and Pleasures of a religious Life. <HI>We have Joy and Peace in believing.</HI> Rom. xv. 13.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, and by our <HI>holding fast our Confidence firm unto the End,</HI> that we are rendred stable and stedfast in our religious Course, and enabled to persevere to the End. <HI>Thou standest by Faith: Be not high-minded, but fear.</HI> Rom. xi. 20.&mdash;It is by <HI>Faith,</HI> that we obtain the Sealings of the blessed Spirit, and the Earnests of our future Inheritance. <HI>In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of our Inheritance.</HI> Eph. i. 13, 14.&mdash;And in a Word, it is by <HI>Faith,</HI> that we keep the Mark for the Prize of our high Calling in View, and are actuated to the diligent Pursuit of the Recom|pence of Reward. <HI>Faith is the Substance of Things

hoped for; and the Evidence of Things not seen.</HI> Heb. xi. 1.&mdash;Thus you see, that if you would <HI>walk with God,</HI> you must <HI>walk by Faith in the Son of God.</HI>&mdash;Here therefore it seems needful to give you some plain and familiar Directions.</P>
<P>And I would first direct you, to <HI>look to Jesus</HI> as <HI>the Author and Finisher of your Faith.</HI>&mdash;"You are (you say) <HI>uncertain,</HI> whether you have a true <HI>Faith,</HI> or not?" Look then to this Fountain of all Grace, to get your Doubts removed, to be freed from this uncomforta|ble Suspence of Mind, and to be sensibly, as well as really, united to that glorious Head of all spiritual Influences.&mdash;Be frequently lifting up your Soul to him, with such Aspirations as these. <Q>Blessed JESUS! Thou knowest the distracting Doubts and Fears, I am exercised with; and my perplexing Uncer|tainty of an Interest in and Union unto Thee by <HI>Faith.</HI> A Difficulty, which Thou only canst re|move, by the Operations of thy holy Spirit. Thou hast invited me to <HI>come unto thee,</HI> to <HI>buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price;</HI> and to <HI>take of the Waters of Life freely.</HI> O Lord, I de|sire, I resolve to comply with the gracious Invita|tion. <HI>Lord, I</HI> would <HI>believe: Help Thou mine Unbelief.</HI>&mdash;Thou hast promised, that if <HI>I come unto thee, thou will in no wise cast me out.</HI> Lord, I would come at thy Call. <HI>Draw me, and I shall run after thee.</HI>&mdash;Thou didst <HI>come to seek and to save that which was lost;</HI> and <HI>to call Sinners to Repen|tance.</HI> As a lost perishing Sinner, I would there|fore look unto Thee for Pardon, Sanctification, and eternal Salvation. <HI>Thou only hast the Words of eternal Life.</HI> To thee therefore I repair, as to the <HI>Fountain of Life,</HI> and the Foundation of all
<PB N="421" REF="005572_0430_0000000000000000">
my Hope, that <HI>of thy Fulness I may receive, even Grace for Grace.</HI>&mdash;Here is my last Refuge. Look, blessed Lord, upon a poor guilty polluted Soul! Replenish me with thy Grace. Give me that <HI>Faith,</HI> whereby I may comply with thy gracious Invitations, rely upon thy precious Promises; and derive all Supplies of Grace from the inex|haustible Treasury of they Grace and Goodness.</Q></P>
<P>You must endeavour likewise, to act <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ for your Justification, and for your Accep|tance with God in the Duties of Religion; to rely upon him as <HI>the Lord your Righteousness;</HI> and to <HI>make Mention of his Righteousness, even of that only.</HI>&mdash;I have spoken particularly to this in some of my for|met Letters; to which I shall only add, &mdash;You must approach the Presence of God under a deep Impres|sion of your Guilt, Pollution and Unworthiness, and yet with a humble Dependance upon the infinite Merit and Righteousness of Christ, for Access unto God the Father, and Acceptance in the Beloved.&mdash;You must live in a humble Confidence in Christ, as the <HI>Propitiation for your Sins,</HI> as your continual <HI>Ad|vocate with the Father;</HI> and as a constant Source of <HI>Righteousness and Strength</HI> to your Soul. And all your Expectations of pardoning, sanctifying, and sa|ving Mercy must be derived only from Jesus Christ, <HI>who is our Hope, the Hope of Israel, and the Saviour thereof.</HI></P>
<P>You must also act <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ for quickning, and strengthing, as well as justifying Grace.&mdash;Do your Corruptions prevail? Bring them to the <HI>Cross of Christ.</HI> Look to and humbly depend upon <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, to make you free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI>&mdash;Do dead,

carnal or formal Frames prevail upon you? Strive to quicken your Soul by enlivening Meditations on the amazing Transactions of redeeming Love; and firmly rely upon Christ, for the quickning Influences of his Spirit. You will always find your Soul enli|vened, your Graces invigorated, and your Affections spiritualized, in Proportion to your humble, steady, chearful Dependance upon Christ, for all those Sup|plies of Grace you stand in Need of.&mdash;Thus then <HI>wait</HI> upon the Lord Jesus Christ: and <HI>be of good Courage; and he shall strengthen thine Heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord.</HI> So shall you <HI>mount up with Wings as the Eagle, you shall run, and not be weary; you shall walk, and not faint.</HI></P>
<P>I will only subjoin, that you must live by <HI>Faith,</HI> under all your various Circumstances of Life, and under all the different Dispensations of God's holy Providence.&mdash;Are you in the dark, and under inward Trials? Remember, that <HI>we walk by Faith, not by Sight.</HI> Be humbled, but not discouraged, by your Deadness, Darkness, Temptations, or Corruptions: For, however your spiritual Frames, Affections, or Dispositions of Soul may change, yet <HI>Christ Jesus is the same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever;</HI> and may be safely trusted for Deliverance, how distressing soever your Condition. Hence, <HI>when you walk in Darkness, and see no Light; yet trust in the Name of the Lord, and</HI> (by Faith in Christ) <HI>stay your self upon your God.</HI>&mdash;Are you under outward Afflictions, and adverse Dispensations of Providence? Act <HI>Faith</HI> in the Promises; all of which <HI>are in Christ Yea, and in him Amen, to the Glory of God:</HI> And humbly hope, that according to God's gracious Promise <HI>all Things shall work together for your Good;</HI> and that <HI>your light
<PB N="423" REF="005572_0432_0000000000000000">
Affliction which is but for a Moment, will work for you a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI>&mdash;But you are in Doubt about your Interest in the Promises: Well, let your hearty Acceptance of Christ, and your humble Dependance upon the Pro|mises in him, remove your Doubts. Act always un|der the Influence of this Maxim, that <HI>you can't trust too little to your self, nor too much to Christ.</HI>&mdash;To conclude, If you want spiritual Life, <HI>Christ Jesus is our Life:</HI> You must look to and depend upon him for it.&mdash;If you want Light, <HI>he also is the Light of Men;</HI> and his Spirit must be a <HI>Word behind you, say|ing, This is the Way, walk you in it.</HI>&mdash;If you want Comfort, <HI>your Consolation must be in Christ;</HI> and you must <HI>rejoice in Christ Jesus, without Confidence in the Flesh.</HI>&mdash;Would you live near to God? <HI>Draw near with a full Assurance of Faith.</HI>&mdash;Would you have a Victory over the Sting and Terror of Death? You must be <HI>delivered from this Bondage,</HI> and <HI>obtain the Victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI>&mdash;Would you live in the Prospect of a blessed Immortality? <HI>Christ in you is the Hope of Glory.</HI>&mdash;Thus <HI>to live, is Christ, and then to die is Gain:</HI> Gain unspeakable! <HI>To depart and to be with Christ, which is far better than to abide in the Flesh,</HI> under the happiest Circumstances of Life, even a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idst all the Honours, Pleasures, and Riches of this vain, perishing World.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you some brief general Hints concerning that <HI>Walk with God,</HI> which he who would be a <HI>Christian indeed,</HI> and would possess <HI>the Peace of God</HI> in his Soul, should endeavour to maintain.&mdash;Your own Experience in the divine Life will teach you how to improve upon these Directions; and to make a continued Progress, from Grace to Grace,
<PB N="424" REF="005572_0433_0000000000000000">
and from Strength to Strength, till you come to the Perfection of Grace in Glory.</P>
<P>Now, that the God of all Grace may grant you the <HI>Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</HI> in his sancti|fying, quickning, and comforting Influences; and that he would <HI>guide you by his Counsel,</HI> and <HI>keep you by his Power through faith unto Salvation,</HI> is the Prayer of,</P>
