<P>THE Governor and the Commissioners took some of the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs
by the Hand, and, after they had seated themselves, the Governor
bid them welcome into the Government; and there being Wine and

Health to the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> and <HI>Canassatego, Tachanoontia,</HI> and some other

proposed to speak to them on <HI>Monday</HI> next; after which, the honourable

<P><HI>CANASSATEGO</HI> answered the Governor: We thank you for giving
us Time to rest; we are come to you, and shall leave it intirely to you to
appoint the Time when we shall meet you again. We likewise leave it to
the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by whose Invitation we came here, to appoint a
Time when he will please to mention the Reason of his inviting us. As to
our Brother <HI>Assaragoa,</HI> we have at this present Time nothing to say to him;
not but we have a great deal to say to <HI>Assaragoa,</HI> which must be said at one
Time or another; but not being satisfied whether he or we should begin

<P><HI>The GOVERNOR spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Honourable Gentlemen, Commissioners for the Governments of <HI>Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Maryland,</HI> and Brethren, Sachinis, or Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Six
Nations:</P>
<P>AT a Treaty, held by me two Years ago, in Behalf of the Government of
<HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> with a Number of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six
Nations,</HI> I was desired by them to write to the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> con|cerning
some Lands in the back Parts of that Province, which they claim a
Right to from their Conquests over the ancient Possessors, and which have been
settled by some of the Inhabitants of that Government, without their Con|sent,
or any Purchase made from them. It was at that time understood that
the Claim was upon <HI>Maryland</HI> only; but it has since appeared, by some
Letters formerly wrote by Mr. President <HI>Logan</HI> to the late Governor of <HI>Ma|r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">land,</HI>
that it related likewise to some Lands in the back Parts of <HI>Virginia.</HI>
The Governors of those Colonies soon manifested a truly equitable Disposition
to come to any reasonable Terms with the <HI>Six Nations</HI> on account of those
Lands, and desired, that for that End a Time and Place might be fixed for
a Treaty with them; but before this could be effected, an unfortunate skir|mish
<PB N="5" REF="005416_0005_0F608E3D24861518">
happened in the back Parts of <HI>Virginia,</HI> between some of the Militia
there, and a Party of the <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with some
Loss on both Sides. Who were the Aggressors is not at this time to be dis|cussed,
both Parties having agreed to bury that Affair in Oblivion, and the
Government of <HI>Virginia</HI> having, in Token of the Continuance of their
Friendship, presented the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> through my Hands, with Goods to
the Value of One Hundred Pounds Sterling. To prevent further Hostilities,
and to heal this Breach, I had, before the Present was given, made a Ten|der
of my good Offices; which both Parties accepted, and consented, on
my Instances, to lay down their Arms: Since which the Faith pledged to
me has been mutually preserved, and a Time and Place has been agreed upon,
through my Intervention, for accommodating all Differences, and for settling
a firm Peace, Union and Friendship, as well between the Government of
<HI>Virginia</HI> as that of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was slowed, at a Conference had by the Governor with the Commissioners, to be a just State of the Transactions preceding the Treaty.</NOTE>. The
honourable the Commissioners for these two Governments, and the Depati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> are now met at the Place appointed for the Treaty. It
only remains therefore for me to say, That if my further good Offices shall
be thought useful for the Accomplishment of this Work, you may rely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
assuredly upon them.</P>
<P>BUT I hope, honourable Gentlemen Commissioners, it will not be taken
amiss if I go a little further, and briefly represent to you, how especially ne|cessary
it is at this Juncture, for his Majestly's Service, and the Good of all
his Colonies in this Part of his Dominions, that Peace and Friendship be
established between your Governments and the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Indians,</HI> by their Situation, are a Frontier to some of them; and,
from thence, if Friends, are capable of defending their Settlements; if Ene|mies,
of making cruel Rav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ges upon them; if Neuters, they may deny the
<HI>French</HI> a Passage through their Country, and give us timely Notice of their
Designs. These are but some of the Motives for cultivating a good Under|standing
with them; but from hence the Disadvantages of a Rupture are
abundantly evident. Every Advantage you gain over them in War will be a
weakening of the Barrier of those Colonies, and consequently be, in effect,
Victories over yourselves and your Fellow Subjects. Some Allowances for
their Prejudices and Passions, and a Present now and then for the Relief of
their necessities, which have, in some Measure, been brought upon them
by their Intercourse with us, and by our yearly extending our Settlements,
will probably tie them more closely to the <HI>British</HI> Interest. This has been
the Method of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and will not put you to so
much Expence in twenty Years, as the carrying on a War against them will
do in one. The <HI>French</HI> very well know the Importance of these Nations
to us, and will not fail by Presents, and their other usual Arts, to take Ad|vantage
of any Misunderstandings we may have with them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The two preceding Paragraphs were allowed by the Commissioners of <HI>Virginia,</HI> whilst they were at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to be very proper to be spoken by the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> at the Opening of the Treaty; but taking up an Opinion, from what passed at the first friendly Interview with the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they would not make any Claim upon I and; within the Government of <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Governor conse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ted to decline speaking them in the Presence of the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> But I will
detain you, Gentlemen, no longer. Your own superior Knowledge will sug|gest
to you more than I can say on this Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005416_0006_0F608E3DEC0662C0">
Friends and Brethren, Sachims, or Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations:</HI></P>
<P>THESE, your Brethern of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> are come to enlarge
the Fire, which was almost gone out, and to make it burn clearer; to
brighten the Chain which had contracted some Rust, and to renew their
Friendship with you; which it is their Desire may last so long as the Sun,
the Moon and the Star<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">, shall give Light. Their Powers are derived from
the <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND, your Father; and whatever Conclu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ions they
shall come to with you, will be as firm and binding as if the Governors of
these Provinces were themselves here. I am your Brother, and, which is
more, I am your true Friend. As you know, from Experience, that I and
so, I will now give you a few Words of Advice. Receive these your Bre|thren
with open Arms; unite yourselves to them in the Covenant Chain,
and be you with them as one Body, and one Soul. I make no doubt but the
Governor of Canada has been taking Pains to widen the Breach between these
your Brethren of <HI>Virginia</HI> and you; but as you cannot have forgot the Ha|tred
the <HI>French</HI> have always borne to your Nations, and how kindly, on the
contrary, you have been treated, and how faithfully you have been prote|cted
by the <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND and his Subjects, you will not be at
a Loss to see into the Designs of that Governor. He wants to divide you
from us, in order the more easily to destroy you, which he will most cer|tainly
do, if you suffer yourselves to be deluded by him.</P>
<P>As to what relates to the Friendship established between the Government
of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and your Nations, I will take another Day to speak to you
upon it.</P>
<P><HI>To enforce what had been said, the <HI>GOVERNOR</HI> laid down a Belt
of Wampum; upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> gave the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech"></NOTE> <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>AFTER a short P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">use, the Governor ordered the Interpreter to tell the
<HI>Indians,</HI> that as they had greatly exceeded their appointed Time for meeting
the Commissioners, he recommended to them to use all the Expedition pos|sible
in giving their Answer to what had been said, that they might forth|with
proceed to treat with the respective Commissioners on the Business they
came about.</P>
<P>TURN <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"></HI> repeated to the Interpreter the Substance of what the
Governor had spoke&punc; in order to know if he had understood him right (a
Method generally made use of by the <HI>Indians</HI>) and when the Interpreter
told him he had taken the true Sense, C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ssatego. preceeded to return the
Thanks of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> for the Governor's kind Advice, promising to
follow it as far as lay in their Power; but as it was their Custom when a
Belt was given to return another, they would take Time till the Afternoon
to provide one, and would then give their Answer.</P>

<P><HI>Canass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">tego's Answer to the Governor's Speech delivered in the Morning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>YOU spoke in the Presence of <HI>Assaragoa</HI> and the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI>
to us, advising us to receive them as our Brethren, and to unite with
them in the Covenant Chain as one Body, and one Soul. We have always
considered them as our Brethren, and, as such, shall be willing to brighten
the Chain of Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ip with them; but since there are some Disputes be|tween
us respecting the Lands possessed by them, which formerly belonged to
us, we, according to our Custom, propose to have those Differences first ad|justed,
and then we shall proceed to confirm the Friendship subsisting be|tween
us, which will meet with no Obstruction after these Matters are settled.</P>
<P><HI>Here they presented the <HI>GOVERNOR</HI> with a Belt of Wampum, in
return for the Belt given them in the Morning by the <HI>GOVER|NOR;</HI>
and the Interpreter was ordered to return the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the <HI>GOVERNOR,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>I receive your Belt with great Kindness and Affection; and as to what re|lates
to the Governments of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> the honourable Com|missioners,
now present, are ready to treat with you. I shall only add, that
the Goods for the Hundred Pounds Sterling, put into my Hands by the Go|vernor
of <HI>Virginia,</HI> as a Token of his good Dispositions to preserve Friend|ship
with you, are now in Town, and ready to be delivered, in consequence
of what was told you by <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> when he was last at <HI>Onandago.</HI></P>
<P>THEN the Governor, turning to the Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI>
said, Gentlemen, I have now finished what was incumbent upon me
to say by way of Introduction to the <HI>Indians;</HI> and as you have a full Au|thority
from your respective Governments to treat with them, I shal leave
the rest intirely to you, and either stay or withdraw, as you shall think most
for your Service.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005416_0008_0F608E3F64E217C8">
THE Commissioners said, They were all of Opinion, it would be for their
Advantage that the Governor should stay with them; and therefore they
unanimously desired he would favour them with the Continuance of his Pre|sence
whilst they should be in Treaty with the <HI>Indians:</HI> Which his Honour
said he would at their Instance very readily do, believing it might expedite
their Business, and prevent any Jealousy the <HI>Indians</HI> might conceive at his
withdrawing.</P>
<P><HI>The Commissioners of <HI>Maryland</HI> ordered the Interpreter to acquaint the <HI>Indians</HI>
that the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> was going to speak to them, and then spoke
as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Friends and Brethren of the united <HI>Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>WE, who are deputed from the Government of <HI>Maryland</HI> by a Commis|sion
under the Great Seal of that Province, now in our Hands (and which
will be interpreted to you) bid you welcome; and in Token that we are very
glad to see you here as Brethren, we give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> gave the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> received the first Notice, about seven
Years ago, of your Claim to some Lands in that Province, he thought our
good Friends and Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had little Reason to complain
of any Injury from <HI>Maryland,</HI> and that they would be so well convinced
thereof, on farther Deliberation, as he should hear no more of it; but you
spoke of that Matter again to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> about two Years
since, as if you designed to terrify us.</P>
<P>IT was very inconsiderately said by you, that you would do yourselves
Justice, by going to take Payment yourselves: Such an Attempt would have
intirely dissolved the Chain of Friendship subsisting, not only between us,
but perhaps the other <HI>English</HI> and you.</P>
<P>WE assure you, our People, who are numerous, courageous, and have
Arms ready in their Hands, will not suffer themselves to be hurt in their
Lives and Estates.</P>
<P>BUT, however, the old and wise People of <HI>Maryland</HI> immediately met
in Council, and upon considering very coolly your rash Expressions, agreed
to invite their Brethren, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to this Place, that they might
learn of them what Right they have to the Land in <HI>Maryland,</HI> and, if they
had any, to make them some reasonable Compensation for it; therefore the
Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> has sent us to meet and treat with you about this Affair,
and the brightening and strengthening the Chain which hath long sub|sitted
between us. And as an Earnest of our Sincerity and Good-will to|wards
you, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>On which the <HI>Indians</HI> gave the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND, and his Subjects, have always possessed
the Province of <HI>Maryland</HI> free and undisturbed from any Claim of the <HI>Six
Nations</HI> for above one hundred Years past, and your not saying any thing
<PB N="9" REF="005416_0009_0F608E4142956080">
to us before, convinces us you thought you had no Pretence to any Lands in
<HI>Maryland;</HI> nor can we yet find out to what Lands, or under what Title,
you make your Claim: For the <HI>Sasquahannah Indians,</HI> by a Treaty above
ninety Years since (which is on the Table, and will be interpreted to you)
give, and yield to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, their Heirs and Assigns for ever, the
greatest Part (if not all) of the Lands we possess, from <HI>Patuxent</HI> River, on
the Western, as well as from <HI>Choptank</HI> River, on the Eastern Side of the
Great Bay of <HI>Chessapeak.</HI> And, near Sixty Years ago, you acknowledged to
the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> <Q>That you had given your Lands, and
submitted yourselves to the King of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WE are that Great King's Subjects, and we possess and enjoy the Province
of <HI>Maryland</HI> by virtue of his Right and Sovereignty thereto; why, then,
will you stir up any Quarrel between you and ourselves, who are as one Man,
under the Protection of that Great King?</P>
<P>WE need not put you in mind of the Treaty (which we suppose you have
had from your Fathers) made with the Province of <HI>Maryland</HI> near Seventy
Years ago, and renewed and confirmed twice since that time.</P>
<P>BY these Treaties we became Brethren; we have always lived as such,
and hope always to con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">e so.</P>
<P>WE have this further to say, that altho' we are not satisfied of the Justice
of your Claim to any Lands in <HI>Maryland,</HI> yet we are desirous of shew|ing
our Brotherly Kindness and Affection, and to prevent (by any reasonable
Way) every Misunderstanding between the Province of <HI>Maryland</HI> and you
our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Purpose we have brought hither a Quantity of Goods for our
Brethren the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and which will be delivered you as soon as we shall
have received your Answer, and made so bright and large a Fire as may burn
pure and clear whilst the Sun and Moon shall shine.</P>
<P>WE have now freely and openly laid our Bosoms bare to you; and that you
may be the better confirmed of the Truth of our Hearts, we give you this
Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>After a little Time <HI>Canassatego</HI> spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Brother, the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI></P>
<P>WE have heard what you have said to us; and, as you have gone back to
old Times, we cannot give you an Answer now, but shall take what you have
said into Consideration, and return you our Answer some Time to Morrow.
He then sat down, and after some Time he spoke again.</P>
<P>Brother, the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI></P>
<P>IF you have made any Enquiry into <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, you will know, that
we have always had our Guns, Hatchets and Kettles, mended when we came
to see our Brethren. Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and the Governor of <HI>York</HI> always do
this for us; and we give you this early Notice, that we may not thereb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">

delayed, being desirous, as well as you, to give all possible Dispatch to the
Business to be transacted between us.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> said, since it was custo|mary,
they would give Orders to have every Thing belonging to them mended
that should want it.</P>

no Regard to our just Demand, nor that Brother <HI>Onas</HI> had convey'd our Com|plaint
to the Great King over the Seas, we were resolved to use such Ex|pressions
as would make the greatest Impressions on your Minds, and we find
it had its Effect; for you tell us, <Q>That your wise Men held a Council to|gether,
and agreed to invite us, and to enquire of our Right to any of
your Lands, and if it should be found that we had a Right, we were to
have a Compensation made for them: And likewise you tell us, that our
Brother, the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by the Advice of these wise Men,
has sent you to brighten the Chain, and to assure us of his Willingness to
remove whatever impedes a good Understanding between us.</Q> This
shews that your wise Men understood our Expressions in their true Sense.
We had no Design to terrify you, but to put you on doing us the Justice you
had so long delay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d. Your wise Men have done well; and as there is no Ob|stacle
to a good Understanding between us, except this Affair of our Land,
we, on our Parts, do give you the strongest Assurances of our good Disposi|tions
towards you, and that we are as desirous as you to brighten the Chain, and
to put away all Hindrances to a perfect good Understanding; and, in Token
of our Sincerity, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received, and the Interpreter ordered to give the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Brother, the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI></P>
<P>WHEN you mentioned the Affair of the Land Yesterday, you went back
to old Times, and told us, you had been in Possession of the Province of
<HI>Maryland</HI> above One Hundred Years; but what is One Hundred Years in
Comparison of the Leng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">h of Time since our Claim began? since we came
out of this Ground? For we must tell you, that long before One Hundred
Years our Ancestors came out of this very Ground, and their Children have
remained here ever since. You came out of the Ground in a Country that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> beyond the Seas, there you may have a just Claim, but here you must
allow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> to be your elder Brethren, and the Lands to belong to us long before
you knew any thing of them. It is true, that above One Hundred Years
ago the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> came here in a Ship, and brought with them several Goods;
such as Awls, Knives, Hatchets, Guns, and many other Particulars, which
they g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ve us; and when they had taught us how to use their Things, and
we saw what sort of People they were, we were so well pleased with them,
that we ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">d their Ship to the Bushes on the Shore; and afterwards, liking
them still better the longer they staid with us, and thinking the Bushes too
slender, we removed the Rope, and tied it to the Trees; and as the Tree&punc;
were li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ble to be blown down by high Winds, or to decay of themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">&punc;
we, from the Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ction we bore them, again removed the Rope, and tied it
to a strong and bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> Rock [<HI>here the Interpreter said, They mean the</HI> Oncido
<HI>Count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"></HI>] and not content with this, for its further Security we removed the
Rope to the big Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ntain [<HI>here the Interpreter says they mean the</HI> Onandago
<HI>Country</HI> and there we tied it very fast, and rowll'd Wampum about it;
and, to make it still more secure, we stood upon the Wampum, and sat
down upon it, to defend it, and to prevent any Hurt coming to it, and did
our best Endeavours that it might remain uninjured for ever. During all this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> the New-co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">rs, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> acknowledged our Right to the Land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> us, from Time to Time, to grant them Parts of our Country,
and to enter into L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">gue and Covenant with us, and to become one People
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005416_0012_0F608E4327C54A28">
AFTER this the <HI>English</HI> came into the Country, and, as we were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
became one People with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> About two Years after the Arrival of
the <HI>English,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Governor came to <HI>Albany,</HI> and finding what great
Friendship subsitted between us and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he approved it mightily,
and desired to make as strong a League, and to be upon as good Terms with
us as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were, with whom he was united, and to become one Peo|ple
with us: And by his further Care in looking into what had passed be|tween
us, he found that the Rope which tied the Ship to the great Moun|tain
was only fastened with Wampum, which was liable to break and rot,
and to perish in a Course of Years; he therefore told us, he would give us
a Silver Chain, which would be much stronger, and would last for ever.
This we accepted, and fastened the Ship with it, and it has lasted ever since.
Indeed we have had some small Differences with the <HI>English,</HI> and, during
these Misunderstanding, some of their young Men would, by way of Re|proach,
be every now and then telling us, that we should have perished if
they had not come into the Country and furnished us with Strowds and
Hatchets, and Guns, and other Things necessary for the Support of Life;
but we always gave them to understand that they were mistaken, that we
lived before they came amongst us, and as well, or better, if we may be|lieve
what our Forefathers have told us. We had then Room enough, and
Plenty of Deer, which was easily cought; and tho' we had not Knives.
Hatchets, or Gans, such as we have now, yet we had Knives of Stone,
and Hatchets of Stone, and Bows and Arrows, and those served our Uses
as well then as the <HI>English</HI> ones do now. We are now straitened, and some|times
in want of Deer, and liable to many other Inconveniencies since the
<HI>English</HI> came among us, and particularly from that Pen-and-Ink Work that
is going on at the Table (<HI>pointing to the Secretary</HI>) and we will give you an
Instance of this. Our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> a great while ago, came to <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">bany</HI> to
buy the <HI>Sasquahannah</HI> Lands of us, but our Brother, the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI>
who, as we suppose, had not a good Understanding with our Brother
<HI>Onas,</HI> advised us not to sell him any Land, for he would make an ill Use of
it; and, pretending to be our good Friend, he advised us, in order to pre|vent
<HI>Onas</HI>'s, or any other Person's imposing upon us, and that we might al|ways
have our Land when we should want it, to put it into his Hands; and
told us, he would keep it for our Use, and never open his Hands, but keep
them close shut, and not part with any of it, but at our Request. Accord|ingly
we trusted him, and put our Land into his Hands, and charged him
to keep it safe for our Use; but, some Time after, he went to <HI>England,</HI> and
carried our Land with him, and there sold it to our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> for a large
Sum of Money; and when, at the Instance of our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> we were
minded to sell him some Lands, he told us, we had sold the <HI>Sasquahannah</HI>
Lands already to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and that he had bought them
from him in <HI>England;</HI> tho', when he came to understand how the Gover|nor
of <HI>New-York</HI> had deceived us, he very generously paid us for our Lands
over again.</P>
<P>THO' we mention this Instance of an Imposition put upon us by the Go|vernor
of <HI>New-York,</HI> yet we must do the <HI>English</HI> the Justice to say, we
have had their hearty Assistances in our Wars with the <HI>French,</HI> who were no
sooner arrived amongst us than they began to render us uneasy, and
to provoke us to War, and we have had several Wars with them; dur|ing
all which we co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">tantly received Assistance from the <HI>English,</HI> and,
<PB N="13" REF="005416_0013_0F608E43EF210C58">
by their Means, we have always been able to keep up our Heads against
their Attacks.</P>
<P>WE now come nearer home. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">We have had your Deeds interpreted to us,
and we acknowledge them to be good and valid, and that the <HI>Conestogoe</HI> or

Brethren,</P>
<P>IN the Year 1736, four of your Sachims wrote a Letter to <HI>Iames Logan,</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> then President of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to let the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> know
that you expected some Consideration for Lands in the Occupation of some
of the People of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Upon seeing a Copy of this Letter, the Gover|nor,
with the Council of <HI>Virginia,</HI> took some Time to consider of it. They
found, on looking into the old Treaties, that you had given up your Lands
to the Great King, who has had Possession of <HI>Virginia</HI> above One Hundred
and Sixty Years, and under that Great King the Inhabitants of <HI>Virginia</HI> hold
their Land, so they thought there might be some Mistake.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE they desired the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> to enquire of you
about it. He sent his Interpreter to you in <HI>May,</HI> 1743, who said this be|fore
you at a Council held at <HI>Onandago,</HI> to which you answer, <Q>That if
you had any Demand or Pretensions on the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> any
way, you would have made it known to the Governor of <HI>New-York&punc;</HI></Q>

<P>SINCE you have joined with the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> and Brother
<HI>Onas</HI> in kindling this Fire, we gladly acknowledge the Pleasure we have
in seeing you here, and observing your good Dispositions as well to confirm
the Treaties of Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ip, as to enter into further Contracts about Land
with us; and, in Token of our Satisfaction, we present you with this String
of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremonie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>IN your Speech this Morning you were pleased to say we had wrote a Letter
to <HI>Iames Logan,</HI> about seven Years ago, to demand a Consideration for our
Lands in the Possession of some of the <HI>Virginians;</HI> that you held them under
the Great King for upwards of One Hundred and Sixty Years, and that we had
already given up our Right; and that therefore you had desired the Governor
of <HI>New-York</HI> to send his Interpreter to us last Year to <HI>Onandago,</HI> which he
did; and, as you say, we in Council at <HI>Onandago</HI> did declare, that we had
no Demand upon you for Lands, and that if we had any Pretentions, we
should have made them known to the Governor of <HI>New-York;</HI> and likewise
you desire to know if we have any Right to the <HI>Virginia</HI> Lands, and that
we will make such Right appear, and tell you what Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> we
conquered those Lands from.</P>
<P>Now we answer, We have the Right of Conquest, a Right too dearly
purchased, and which cost us too much Blood, to give up without any Rea|son
at all, as you say we have done at <HI>Albany;</HI> but we should be obliged to
you, if you would let us see the Letter, and inform us who was the Inter|preter,
and whose Names are put to that Letter; for as the whole Transac|tion
cannot be above a Year's standing, it must be fresh in every Body's M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">|mory,
and some of our Council would easily remember it; but we assure
you, and are well able to prove, that neither we nor any Part of us, have
ever relinquished our Right, or ever such an Answer as you say is men|tioned
in your Letter. Could we, so few Years ago, make a formal De|mand,
by <HI>Iames Logan,</HI> and not be sensible of our Right? And hath any
thing happened since that Time to make us less sensible? No; and as this
Matter can be easily cleared up, we are anxious it should be done; for we
<PB N="16" REF="005416_0016_0F608E4626B4B4E8">
are positive no such thing was ever mentioned to us at <HI>Onandago,</HI> nor any
where else. All the World knows we conquered the several Nations living
on <HI>Sasquahanna, Cohongoronta,</HI> and on the Back of the Great Mountains in
<HI>Virginia;</HI> the <HI>Cono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">-uch-such-roona, Coch-now-was-roonan, Tohoa-irough-roonan,</HI>
and <HI>Connu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">skin-ough-roonaw,</HI> feel the Effects of our Conquests, be|ing
now a Part of our Nations, and their Lands at our Disposal. We know
very well, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ath often been said by the <HI>Virginians,</HI> that the <HI>Great King of</HI>
ENGLAND, and the People of that Colony, conquered the <HI>Indians</HI> who lived
there, but it is not true. We will allow they have conquered the <HI>Sachda|gughroonaw,</HI>
and drove back the <HI>Tuscarroraws,</HI> and that they have, on that
Account, a Right to some Part of <HI>Virginia;</HI> but as to what lies beyond the
Mountains, we conquered the Nations residing there, and that Land, if the
<HI>Virginians</HI> ever get a good Right to it, it must be by us; and in Testimony
of the Truth of our Answer to this Part of your Speech, we give you this
String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>WE have given you a full Answer to the first Part of your Speech, which
we hope will be satisfactory. We are glad to hear you have brought with
you a big Chest of new Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets.
We do not doubt but we shall have a good Understanding in all Points, and
come to an Agreement with you.</P>
<P>WE shall open all our Hearts to you, that you may know every thing in
them; we will hide nothing from you; and we hope, if there be any thing
still remaining in your Breast that may occasion any Dispute between us, you
will take the Opportunity to unbosom your Hearts, and lay them open to us,
that henceforth there may be no Dirt, nor any other Obstacle in the Road
between us; and in Token of our hearty Wishes to bring about so good an
Harmony, we present you with this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>WE must now tell you what Mountains we mean that we say are the
Boundaries between you and us. You may remember, that about twenty
Years ago you had a Treaty with us at <HI>Albany,</HI> when you took a Belt of
Wampum, and made a Fence with it on the Middle of the Hill, and told
us, that if any of the Warriors of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> came on your Side of the
Middle of the Hill, you would hang them; and you gave us Liberty to do
the same with any of your People who should be found on our Side of the
Middle of the Hill. This is the Hill we mean, and we desire that Treaty
may be now confirmed. After we left <HI>Albany,</HI> we brought our Road a great
deal more to the West, that we might comply with your Proposal; but, tho'
it was of your own making, your People never observed it, but came and
lived on our Side of the Hill, which we don't blame you for, as you live at
a great Distance, near the Seas, and cannot be thought to know what your
People do in the Back-parts: And on their settling, contrary to your own
Proposal, on our new Road, it fell out that our Warriors did some Hurt to
your People's Cattle, of which a Complaint was made, and transmitted to
us by our Brother <HI>Onas;</HI> and we, at his Request, altered the Road again,
and brought it to the Foot of the Great Mountain, where it now is; and it
<PB N="17" REF="005416_0017_0F608E47A3E75C48">
is impossible for us to remove it any further to the West, those Parts of the
Country being absolutely impassable by either Man or Beast.</P>
<P>WE had not been long in the Use of this new Road before your People
came, like Flocks of Birds, and sat down on both Slides of it, and yet we
never made a Complaint to you, tho' you must be sensible those Things must
have been done by your People in manifest Breach of your own Proposal
made at <HI>Albany;</HI> and therefore, as we are now opening our Hearts to you,
we cannot avoid complaining, and desire all these Affairs may be settled, and
that you may be stronger induced to do us Justice for what is past, and to
come to a thorough Settlement for the future, we, in the Presence of the
Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> and Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> present you with this Belt of
Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Tachanoontia</HI> added:</P>
<P>HE forgot to say, that the Affair of the Road must be looked upon as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
Preliminary to be settled before the Grant of Lands; and that either the <HI>Vir|ginia</HI>
People must be obliged to remove more Easterly, or, if they are per|mitted

<HI>Iohn Armstrong,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Trader, and his two Men, in a most barba|rous
Manner, as he was travelling to <HI>Allegheny,</HI> and stole his Goods of a
considerable Value. <HI>Shick Calamy,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> settled at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> did
well; they seized two of the Murderers, and sent them down to our Settle|ments;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had the Charge of them, afterwards suffered
one of them to escape, on a Pretence that he was not concerned in the bloody

to a Murder are to be tried, and put to Death, as well as the Person
who gave the deadly Wound. If they consented to it, encouraged it, or any
ways assisted in it, they are to be put to Death, and it is just it should be so.
If, upon Trial, the Persons present at the Murder are found not to have done
any of these Things, they are set at Liberty. Two of our People were,
not many Years ago, publickly put to Death for killing two <HI>Indians;</HI> we
therefore expect you will take the most effectual Measures to seize and de|liver
up to us the other two <HI>Indians</HI> present at these Murders, to be tried
with the Principal now in Custody. If it shall appear, upon their Trial,
that they were not advising, or any way assisting in this horrid Fact, they
will be acquitted, and sent home to their Towns. And that you may be sa|tisfied
no Injustice will be done to them, I do now invite you to depute three
or four <HI>Indians</HI> to be present at their Trials. I do likewise expect that you
will order strict Search to be made for the Remainder of the stolen Goods,
that they may be restored to the Wife and Children of the Dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">sed. That

Goods, and make an End of this Matter.</P>
<P>WE will not omit acquainting our good Friends the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that not|withstanding
we are likely to come to an Agreement about your Claim of
Lands, yet your Brethren of <HI>Muryland</HI> look on you to be as one So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">l and

we shall always be desirous of keeping it clear, that we may, from Time to

<P>MR. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">iser</HI> acquainted the <HI>Indians,</HI> they might now look over the several
Goods <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> on a Table in the Chamber for that Purpose; and the honou|rable
Commissioners bid him tell them, if they disliked any of the Goods,
or, if they were damaged, the Commissioners would put a less Prince on such

<P>THE <HI>Indians</HI> having viewed and examined the Goods, and seeming dissa|tisfied
at the Price and Worth of them, required Time to go down into the
Court-House, in order for a Consultation to be had by the Chiefs of them
concerning the said Goods, and likewise that the Interpreter might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">

and soon after returned again into the Chamber.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Weiser</HI> sat down among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and discoursed them about
the Goods, and in some short Time after they chose the following from

<P><HI>The Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> desired the Interpreter to let the <HI>Indians</HI> know
that their Brother <HI>Assaragoa</HI> was n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ing to give his Reply to their An|swer
to his first Speech, delivered them the Day before in the Foreno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">n.</HI></P>
<P>Sachims and Warriors of the united <HI>Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>WE are now come to answer what you said to us Yesterday, since what
we said to you before on the Part of the Great King, our Father,
has not been satisfactory. You have gone into old Times, and so must we.
It is true that the Great King holds <HI>Virginia</HI> by Right of Conquest, and the
Bounds of that Conquest to the Westward is the Great Sea.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have made any Conquest over <HI>Indians</HI> that may at any
Time have lived on the West-side of the Great Mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> yet
they never possessed any Lands there that w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ve ever heard of. That Part
was altogether deserted, and free for any People to enter upon, as the People
of <HI>Virginia</HI> have done, by Order of the Great King, very justly, as well by
an ancient Right, as by its being freed from the Possession of any other, and
from any Claim even of you the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> our Brethren, until within
these eight Years. The first Treaty between the Great Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">, in Behalf of
his Subjects of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and you, that we can find, was made at <HI>Alba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">,</HI>
by Colonel <HI>Henry Courl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">y,</HI> Seventy Years since; this was a Treaty of Friend|ship,
when the first Covenant Chain was male, when we and you became
Brethren.</P>
<P>The next Treaty was also at <HI>Albany,</HI> above Fifty-eight Years ago, by the Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> Governor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> then you declare yourselves Subjects to the Great King, our Father, and gave up to him all your Lands for his Protec|tion. This you own in a Treaty made by the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> with you at the same Place in the Year 1687, and you express youselves in these Words, <Q>Brethren, you tell us the King of <HI>England</HI> is a very great King, and why should not you join with us in a very just Cause, when the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="missing">ench join with our Enemies in an unjust Cause? O Brethren, we see the Rea|son
<PB N="21" REF="005416_0021_0F608E4C07B41778">
of this; for the <HI>French</HI> would fain kill us all, and when that is done
they would carry all the Beaver Trade to <HI>Canada,</HI> and the <HI>Great King of</HI>
ENGLAND would lose the Land likewise; and therefore, O Great Sachim,
beyond the Great Lakes, awake, and suffer&punc;not those poor&punc; <HI>Indians,</HI> that
have given themselves and their Lands under your Protection, to be de|stroyed
by the <HI>French</HI> without a Cause.</Q></P>
<P>THE last Treaty we shall speak to you about is that made at <HI>Albany</HI> by
Governor <HI>Spotswood,</HI> which you have not recited as it is: For the white
People, your Brethren of <HI>Virginia,</HI> are, in no Article of that Treaty, pro|hibited
to pass, and settle to the Westward of the Great Mountains. It is
the <HI>Indians,</HI> tributary to <HI>Virginia,</HI> that are restrained, as you and your tri|butary
<HI>Indians</HI> are from passing to the Eastward of the same Mountains, or
to the Southward of <HI>Cohongorooton,</HI> and you agree to this Article in these
Words; <Q>That the Great River of <HI>Potowmack,</HI> and the high Ridge of
Mountains, which extend all along the Frontiers of <HI>Virginia</HI> to the West|ward
of the present Settlements of that Colony, shall be for ever the esta|blished
Boundaries between the <HI>Indians</HI> subject to the Dominions of <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI>
and the <HI>Indians</HI> belonging and depending on the <HI>Five Nations;</HI> so
that neither our <HI>Indians</HI> shall not, on any Pretence whatsoever, pass to
Northward or Westward of the said Boundaries, without having to pro|duce
a Passport under the Hand and Seal of the Governor or Commander
in Chief of <HI>Virginia;</HI> nor your <HI>Indians</HI> to pass to the Southward or East|ward
of the said Boundaries, without a Passport in like Manner from the
Governor or Commander in Chief of <HI>New-York.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND what Right can you have to Lands that you have no Right to walk
upon, but upon certain Conditions? It is true, you have not observed this
Part of the Treaty, and your Brethren of <HI>Virginia</HI> have not insisted upon it
with a due Strictness, which has occasioned some Mischief.</P>
<P>THIS Treaty has been sent to the Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> by Order of the
Great King, and is what we must rely on, and, being in Writing, is more
certain than your Memory. That is the Way the white People have of pre|serving
Transactions of every Kind, and transmitting them down to their
Childrens Children for ever, and all Disputes among them are settled by this
faithful kind of Evidence, and must be the Rule between the Great King
and you. This Treaty your Sachims and Warriors signed some Years after
the same Governor <HI>Spotswood,</HI> in the Right of the Great King, had been,
with some People of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in Possession of these very Lands, which you
have set up your late Claim to.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs at <HI>Albany</HI> gave the Account w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
mentioned to you Yesterday to the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> and he sent it
to the Governor of <HI>Virginia;</HI> their Names will be given you by the In|terpreter.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>THIS Dispute is not between <HI>Virginia</HI> and you; it is setting up your
Right against the Great King, under whose Grants the People you complain
of are settled. Nothing but a Command from the Great King can remove
them; they are too powerful to be removed by any Force of you, our Bre|thren&punc;
and the Great King, as our common Father, will do equal Justice
<PB N="22" REF="005416_0022_0F608E4C3ADF2AC0">
to all his Children; where<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ore we do believe they will be confirmed in their
Possessions.</P>
<P>As to the Road you mention, we intended to prevent any Occasion for
it, by making a Peace between you and the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> a few Years
since, at a considerable Expence to our Great King, which you confirmed at
<HI>Albany.</HI> It seems, by your being at War with the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> that it has not
been long kept between you.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, if you desire a Road, we will agree to one on the Terms of
the Treaty you made with Colonel <HI>Spotswood,</HI> and your People, behaving
themselves orderly like Friends and Brethren, shall be used in their Passage
through <HI>Virginia</HI> with the same Kindness as they are when they pass through
the Lands of your Brother <HI>Onas.</HI> This, we hope, will be agreed to by
you our Brethren, and we will abide by the Promise made to you Yesterday.</P>
<P>WE may proceed to settle what we are to give you for any Right you
may have, or have had to all the Lands to the Southward and Westward of
the Lands of your Brother the Governor of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">
<HI>Onas;</HI> tho' we are informed that the Southern <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech"> very

<P><PB N="23" REF="005416_0023_0F608E4CF9749A58">
WE are willing to renounce all Right to Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> of all those Lands

<P><HI><HI>Gachradodow,</HI> Speaker for the <HI>Indians,</HI> in Answer to the Commissioners
Speech at the last Meeting, with a strong Voice, and proper Action, spoke
as follows:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>THE World at the first was made on the other Side of the Great Water
different from what it is on this Side, as may be known from the dif|ferent
Colours of our Skin, and of our Flesh, and that which you call Ju|stice
may not be so amongst us; you have your Laws and Customs, and so
have we. The Great King might send you over to conquer the <HI>Indians,</HI>
but it looks to us that God did not approve of it; if he had, he would not
have placed the Sea where it is, as the Limits between us and you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>THO' great Things are well remembered among us, yet we don't remem|ber
that we were ever conquered by the Great King, or that we have been
employed by that Great King to conquer others; if it was so, it is beyond
our Memory. We do remember we were employed by <HI>Maryland</HI> to conquer
the Conestog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">es, and that the second time we were at War with them, we
carried them all off.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005416_0024_0F608E4DA5625FA0">
<HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>YOU charge us with not acting agreeable to our Peace with the <HI>Catawbas,</HI>
we will repeat to you truly what was done. The Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI>
at <HI>Albany,</HI> in Behalf of <HI>Assaragoa,</HI> gave us several Belts of Wampum from
the <HI>Cherikees</HI> and <HI>Catawbas,</HI> and we agreed to a Peace, if those Nations
would send some of their great Men to us to confirm it Face to Face, and
that they would trade with us; and desired that they would appoint a Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
to meet at <HI>Albany</HI> for that Purpose, but they never came.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>WE then desired a Letter might be sent to the <HI>Catawbas</HI> and <HI>Cherikees,</HI> to
desire them to come and confirm the Peace. It was long before an Answer
came; but we met the <HI>Cherikees,</HI> and confirmed the Peace, and sent some
of our People to take care of them, until they returned to their own Country.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Catawbas</HI> refused to come, and sent us word&punc; That we were but
Women, that they were Men, and double Men, for they had two P&mdash;s;
that they could make Women of us, and would be always <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">t War with us.
They are a deceitful People. Our Brother <HI>Assaragoa</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">;
we don't blame him for it, but are sorry he is so deceived.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>WE have confirmed the Peace with the <HI>Cherikees,</HI> but not with the <HI>Ca|tawbas.</HI>
They have been treacherous, and know it; so that the War must
continue till one of us is destroyed. This we think proper to tell you, that
you may not be troubled at what we do to the <HI>Catawbas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>We will now speak to the Point between us. You say you will agree
with us as to the Road; we desire that may be the Road which was last
made (the Waggon-Road.) It is always a Custom among Brethren or Stran|gers
to use each other kindly; you have some very ill-natured People living
up there; so that we desire the Persons in Power may know that we are to
have reasonable Victuals when we are in want.</P>
<P>YOU know very well, when the white People came first here they were
poor; but now they have got our Lands, and are by them become rich, and
we are now poor, what little we have had for the Land goes soon away,
but the Land lasts for ever. You told us you had brought with you a Chest
of Goods, and that you have the Key in your Pockets; but we have never
seen the Chest, nor the Goods that are said to be in it; it may be small, and
the Goods few; we want to see them, and are desirous to come to some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">nclusion. We have been sleeping here these ten Days past, and have not
done any thing to the Purpose.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners told them they should see the Goods on <HI>Monday.</HI></P>

<P>THE three Governments entertained the <HI>Indians,</HI> and all the Gentlemen
in Town, with a handsome Dinner. The <HI>Six Nations,</HI> in their Order,
having returned Thanks with the usual Solemnity of <HI>Yo-ha-han,</HI> the Inter|preter
informed the Governor and the Commissioners, that as the Lord Pro|prietor
and Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> was not known to the <HI>Indians</HI> by any par|ticular
Name, they had agreed, in Council, to take the first Opportunity of a
large Company to present him with one; and as this with them is deemed a
Matter of great Consequence, and attended with Abundance of Form, the
several Nations had drawn Lots for the Performance of the Ceremony, and
the Lot falling on the <HI>Cayogo</HI> Nation, they had chosen <HI>Gachradodow,</HI> one of
their Chiefs, to be their Speaker, and he desired Leave to begin; which be|ing
given, he, on an elevated Part of the Court-House, with all the Dignity
of a Warrior, the Gesture of an Orator, and in a very graceful Posture,
spoke as follows:</P>
<P><Q>As the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> had invited them here to treat about
their Lands, and brighten the Chain of Friendship, the united Nations
thought themselves so much obliged to them, that they had come to a
Resolution in Council to give to the great Man, who is Proprietor of <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI>
a particular Name, by which they might hereafter correspond with
him; and as it had fallen to the <HI>Coyogoes</HI> Lot in Council to consider of a
proper Name for that chief Man, they had agreed to give him the Name
of <HI>Tocarry-hogan,</HI> denoting Precedency, Excellency, or living in the middle
or honourable Place betwixt <HI>Assaragoa</HI> and their Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> by whom
their Treaties might be better carried on.</Q> And then, addressing him|self
to his Honour the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> the honourable the Com|missioners
of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and to the Gentlemen then present,

<P><Q>As there is a Company of great Men now assembled, we take this Time

<P><HI>CANASSATEGO spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>THE other Day you was pleased to tell us, you were always concerned
whenever any thing happened that might give you or us Uneasiness, and
that we were mutually eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ged to preserve the Road open and clear between
<PB N="27" REF="005416_0027_0F608E50D1354DD0">
us; and you informed us of the Murder of <HI>Iohn Armstrong,</HI> and his two
Men, by some of the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> and of their stealing his Goods to a
considerable Value. The <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> as you suppose, are under our
Power. We join with you in your Concern for such a vile Proceeding; and,
to testify that we have the same Inclinations with you to keep the Road clear,
free and open, we give you this St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ing of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>THESE Things happen frequently, and we desire you will consider the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
well, and not be too much concerned. Three <HI>Indians</HI> have been killed at
different Times at <HI>Ohio,</HI> and we never mentioned any of them to you, ima|gining
it might have been occasioned by some unfortunate Quarrels, and be|ing
unwilling to create a Disturbance. We therefore desire you will consider
these. Things well, and, to take the Grief from your Heart, we give you
this St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ing of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>WE had heard of the Murder of <HI>Iohn Armstrong,</HI> and, in our Journey
here, we had Conference with our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> about it, and re|proved
them severely for it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> them to go down to our Brother
<HI>Onas,</HI> and make him Satisfaction, both for the Men that were killed, and
for the Goods. We understood, by them, that the principal Actor in these
Murders is in your Prison, and that he had done all the Mischief himself;
but that, besides him, you had required and demanded two others who
were in his Company when the Murders were committed. We promise
faithfully; in our Return, to renew our Reproofs, and to charge the <HI>Dela|wares</HI>
to send down some of their Chiefs with these two young Men (but
not as Prisoners) to be examined by you; and as we think, upon Examina|tion,
you will not find them guilty, we rely on your Justice not to do them
any Harm, but to permit them to return home in Safety.</P>
<P>WE likewise understand, that Search has been made for the Goods be|longing
to the Deceased, and that some have been already returned to your
People, but that some are still missing. You may depend upon our giving
the strictest Charge to the <HI>Delawares</HI> to search again with more Diligence
for the Goods, and to return them, or the Value of them, in Skins. And,
to confirm what we have said, we give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>The <HI>Conoy Indians</HI> have informed us, that they sent you a Message, some
Time ago, to advise you, that they were ill used by the white People in
the Place where they had lived, and that they had come to a Resolution of
removing to <HI>Shamokin,</HI> and requested some small Satisfaction for their Land;
and as they never have received any Answer from you, they have desired us
to speak for them; we heartily recommend their Case to your Generosity.
<PB N="28" REF="005416_0028_0F608E51B2DAEFA8">
And, to give Weight to our Recommendation, we present you with this
String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Governor having conferred a little Time with the honourable Commissioners
of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> made the following Reply:</HI></P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>I am glad to find that you agree with me in the Necessity of keeping the
Road between us clear and open, and the Concern you have expressed on
account of the barbarous Murders mentioned to you, is a Proof of your Bro|therly
Affection for us. If Crimes of this Nature be not strictly enquired
into, and the Criminals severely punished, there will be an End of all Com|merce
between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> and then you will be altogether in the
Power of the <HI>French.</HI> They will set what Price they please on their own
Goods, and give you what they think fit for your Skins; so it is for your own
Interest that our Traders should be safe in their Persons and Goods when
they travel to your Towns.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>I considered this Matter well before I came from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and I ad|vised
with the Council there upon it, as I have done here with the honou|rable
the Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI> I never heard before
of the Murder of the three <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio;</HI> had Complaint been made to
me of it, and it had appeared to have been committed by any of the People
under my Government, they should have been put to Deati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">, as two of them
were, some Years ago, for killing two <HI>Indians.</HI> You are not to take your
own Satisfaction, but to apply to me, and I will see that Justice be done you;
and should any of the <HI>Indians</HI> rob or murder any of our People, I do expect
that you will deliver them up to be tried and punished in the same Manner as
white People are. This is the Way to preserve Friendship between us, and
will be for your Benefit as well as ours. I am well pleased with the Steps
you have already taken, and the Reproofs you have given to your Cousins the
<HI>Delawares,</HI> and do expect you will lay your Commands upon some of their
Chiefs to bring down the two young Men that were present at the Mur|ders;
if they are not brought down, I shall look upon it as a Proof of their
Guilt.</P>
<P>IF, upon Examination, they shall be found not to have been concerned in
the bloody Action, they shall be well used, and sent home in Safety: I
will take it upon myself to see that they have no Injustice done them. An
Inventory is taken of the Goods already restored, and I expect Satisfaction
will be made for such as cannot be found, in Skins, according to their Pro|mise.</P>
<P>I well remember the coming down of one of the <HI>Conoy Indians</HI> with a
Paper, setting forth, That the <HI>Conoys</HI> had come to a Resolution to leave the
Land reserved for them by the Proprietors, but he made no Complaint to
me of ill Usage from the white People. The Reason he gave for their Re|moval
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">, That the settling of the white People all round them had made
Deer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">, and that therefore they chose to remove to <HI>Iuniata</HI> for the Be|nefit
<PB REF="005416_0029_0F608E52442781D0">
of Hunting. I ordered what they said to be entered in the Council-Book.
The old Man's Expences were born, and a Blanket given him at
his Return home. I have not yet heard from the Proprietors on this Head;
but you may be assured, from the Favour and Justice they have always shewn
to the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they will do every thing that can be reasonably expected
of them in this Case.</P>

<P><HI>The <HI>Indians</HI> being told, by the Interpreter, that their Brother <HI>Assaragoa</HI> was
going to speak to them, the Commissioners spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Sachims and Warriors, our Friends and Brethren,</P>
<Q><P>AS we have already said enough to you on the Subject of the Title to
the Lands you claim from <HI>Virginia,</HI> we have no Occasion to say any
thing more to you on that Head, but come directly to the Point.</P>
<P>WE have opened the Chest, and the Goods are now here before you;
they cost Two Hundred Pounds <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Money, and were bought by
a Person recommended to us by the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> with ready
Cash. We ordered them to be good in their Kinds, and we believe they
are so. These Goods, and Two Hundred Pounds in Gold, which lie on
the Table, we will give you, our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> upon Con|dition
that you immediately make a Deed recognizing the King's Right to
all the Lands that are, or shall be, by his Majesty's Appointment in the Co|lony
of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Road, we agree you shall have one, and the Regulation is in
Paper, which the Interpreter now has in his Custody to shew you. The
People of <HI>Virginia</HI> shall perform their Part, if you and your <HI>Indians</HI> perform
theirs; we are your Brethren, and will do no Hardships to you, but, on the
contrary, all the Kindness we can.</P></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Indians</HI> agreed to what was said, and <HI>Canassatego</HI> desired they would
represent their Case to the King, in order to have a further Consideration
when the Settlement increased much further back. To which the Commis|sioners
agreed, and promised they would make such a Representation faith|fully
and honestly; and, for their further Security that they would do
so, they would give them a Writing, under their Hands and Seals, to that
Purpose.</P>
<P>THEY desired that some Rum might be given them to drink on their Way
home, which the Commissioners agreed to, and paid them in Gold for that
<PB N="30" REF="005416_0030_0F608E52E5BBB2D0">
Purpose, and the Carriage of their Goods from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> Nine Pounds,
Thirteen Shillings, and Three-pence, <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Money.</P>
<P><HI>Canassatego</HI> further said, That as their Brother <HI>Tocarry-hogan</HI> sent them
Provision on the Road here, which kept them from starving, he hoped their
Brother <HI>Assaragoa</HI> would do the same for them back, and have the Goods
he gave them carried to the usual Place; which the Commissioners agreed
to, and ordered Provisions and Carriages to be provided accordingly.</P>
<P>AFTER this Conference the Deed was produced, and the Interpreter ex|plained
it to them; and they, according to their Rank and Quality, put
their Marks and Seals to it in the Presence of several Gentlemen of <HI>Mary|land,
Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> and when they delivered the Deed, <HI>Canas|satego</HI>
delivered it for the Use of their Father, the Great King, and hoped
he would consider them; on which the Gentlemen and <HI>Indians</HI> then present
gave three Shouts.</P>

<ITEM>The Deputies of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Conrad Weiser, <HI>Interpreter.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>The <HI>GOVERNOR</HI> spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Friends and Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>AT a Treaty held with many of the Chiefs of your Nations Two Years
ago, the Road between us was made clearer and wider; our Fire was
enlarged, and our Friendship confirmed by an Exchange of Presents, and
many other mutual good Offices.</P>
<P>WE think ourselves happy in having been instrumental to your meeting
with our Brethren of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> and we persuade ourselves,
that you, on your Parts, will always remember it as an Instance of our Good|will
and Assection for you. This has given us an Opportunity of seeing you
sooner than perhaps we should otherwise have done; and, as we are under
mutual Obligations by Treaties, we to hear with our Ears for you, and you
to hear with your Ears for us, we take this Opportunity to inform you of
what very nearly concerns us both.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND and the <HI>French</HI> King have declared War
against each other. Two Battles have been fought, one by Land, and the
<PB N="31" REF="005416_0031_0F608E55599FA588">
other by Sea. The <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND commanded the Land Army
in Person, and gained a compleat Victory. Numbers of the <HI>French</HI> were
killed and taken Prisoners, and the rest were forced to pass a River with Pre|cipitation
to save their Lives. The Great God covered the King's Head in
that Battle, so that he did not receive the least Hurt; for which you, as well
as we, have Reason to be very thankful.</P>
<P>THE Engagement at Sea was likewise to the Advantage of the <HI>English.</HI>
The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> joined their Ships together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ame out to fight
us. The brave <HI>English</HI> Admiral burnt one of their largest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">hips, and many
others were so shattered, that they were glad to take the Opportunity of a very
high Wind, and a dark Night, to run away, and to hide themselves again
in their own H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">rbours. Had the Weather proved fair, he would, in all
Probability, have taken or destroyed them all.</P>
<P>I need not put you in mind how much <HI>William Penn</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> Sons have
been your Friends, and the Friends of all the <HI>Indians.</HI> You have long and
often experienced their Friendship for you; nor need I repeat to you how
kindly you were treated, and what valuable Presents were made to you Two
Years ago by the Governor, the Council, and the Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">mbly, of <HI>Pennsylva|nia.</HI>
The Sons of <HI>William Penn</HI> are all now in <HI>England,</HI> and have left me
in their Place, well knowing how much I regard you and all the <HI>Indians.</HI> As
a fresh Proof of this, I have left my House, and am come thus far to see you,
to renew our Treaties, to brighten the Covenant Chain, and to confirm our
Friendship with you. In Testimony whereof, I pres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nt you with this Belt
of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>As your Nations have engaged themselves by Treaty to assist us, your Bre|thren
of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in case of a War with the <HI>French,</HI> we do not doubt
but you will punctually perform an Engagement so solemnly entred into. A
War i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> now declared, and we expect that you will not suffer the <HI>French,</HI> or
any of the <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with them, to march through your Country
to disturb any of our Settlements; and that you will give us the earliest and
best Intelligence of any Designs that may be formed by them to our Disad|vantage,
as we promise to do of any that may be to yours. To enforce
what I have now said to you in the strongest Manner, I present you with
this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>After a little Pause his Honour, the <HI>GOVERNOR,</HI> spoke again:</HI></P>
<P>Friends and Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>WHAT I have now said to you is in Conformity to Treaties subsisting be|tween
the Province of which I am Governor and your Nations. I now
proceed, with the Consent of the honourable Commissioners for <HI>Virginia</HI>
and <HI>Maryland,</HI> to tell you, that all Differences having been adjusted, and
the Roads between us and you made quite clear and open, we are ready to
confirm our Treaties with your Nations, and establish a Friendship that is
not to end, but with the World itself. And, in Behalf of the Province of
<HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> I do, by this fine Belt of Wampum, and a Present of Goods.
<PB N="32" REF="005416_0032_0F608E55E79FEBC0">
to the Value of Three Hundred Pounds, confirm and establish the said Trea|ties
of Peace, Union and Friendship, you on your Parts doing the same.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with a loud <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></HI></P>
<P>THE Governor further added, The Goods bought with the One Hundred
Pounds Sterling, put into my Hands by the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> are ready
to be delivered when you please. The Goods bought and sent up by the
People of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> according to the List which the
Interpreter will explain, are laid by themselves, and are likewise ready to be
delivered to you at your own time.</P>
<P><HI>After a little Pause the Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Sachems and Warriors of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>THE Way between us being made smooth by what passed Yesterday, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
desire now to confirm all former Treaties made between <HI>Virginia</HI> and you,
our Brethren of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and to make our Chain of&punc; Union and
Friendship as bright as the Sun, that it may not contract any more Rust for
ever; that our Childrens Children may rejoice at, and confirm what we have
done; and that you and your Children may not forget it, we give you One
Hundred Pounds in Gold, and this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P>Friends and Brethren,</P>
<P>ALTHO' w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> have been disappointed in our Endeavours to bring about a
Peace between you and the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> yet we desire to speak to you something
more about them. We believe they have been unfaithful to you, and spoke
of you with a foolish Contempt: but this may be only the Rashness of
some of their young Men. In this Time of War with our common Ene|mies
the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it will be the wisest Way to be at Peace
among ourselves. They, the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> are also Children of the Great King,
and therefore we desire you will agree, that we may endeavour to make a
Peace between you and them, that we may be all united by one common
Chain of Friendship. We give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>OUR Friend, <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> when he is old, will go into the other
World, as our Fathers have done; our Children will then want such a
Friend to go between them and your Children, to reconcile any Differences
that may happen to arise between them, that, like him, may have the Ears
and Tongues of our Children and yours.</P>
<P>THE Way to have such a Friend, is for you to send three or four of your
Boys to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where we have a fine House for them to live in, and a
Man on purpose to teach the Children of you, our Friends, the Religion,
Language and Customs of the white People. To this Place we kindly in|vite
you to send some of your Children, and we promise you they shall
have the same Care taken of them&punc; and be instructed in the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
<PB N="33" REF="005416_0033_0F608E56ADD7CF30">
as our own Children, and be returned to you again when you please; and,
to confirm this, we give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Commissioners of <HI>Maryland</HI> spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>Friends and Brethren, the Chiefs or Sachims of the <HI>Six</HI> united <HI>Nations,</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> invited you hither, we have treated you as
Friends, and agreed with you as Brethren.</P>
<P>As the Treaty now made concerning the Lands in <HI>Maryland</HI> will, we
hope, prevent effectually every future Misunderstanding between us on that
Account, we will now bind faster the Links of our Chain of Friendship,
by a Renewal of all our former Treaties; and that they may still be the
better secured, we shall present you with One Hundred Pounds in Gold.</P>
<P>WHAT we have further to say to you is, Let not our Chain contract any
Rust; whenever you perceive the least Speck, tell us of it, and we will
make it clean. This we also expect of you, that it may always continue
so bright as our Generations may see their Faces in it; and, in Pledge of the
Truth of what we have now spoken, and our Affection to you, we give you
this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CANASSATEGO, in return, spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, Assaragoa, <HI>and</HI> Tocarry-hogan,</P>
<P>WE return you Thanks for your several Speeches, which are very agree|able
to us. They contain Matters of such great Moment, that we propose
to give them a very serious Consideration, and to answer them suitably to
their Worth and Excellence; and this will take till To-morrow Morning,
and when we are ready we will give you due Notice.</P>
<P>You tell us you beat the <HI>French;</HI> if so, you must have taken a great
deal of Rum from them, and can the better spare us some of that Liquor
to make us rejoice with you in the Victory.</P>
<P>THE Governor and Commissioners ordered a Dram of Rum to be given
to each in a small Glass, calling it, <HI>A French Glass.</HI></P>

<P>You was pleased Yesterday to remind us of our mutual Obligation to
assist each other in case of a War with the <HI>French,</HI> and to repeat the Sub|stance
of what we ought to do by our Treaties with you; and that as a
<PB N="35" REF="005416_0035_0F608E582D43FF58">
War had been already entered into with the <HI>French,</HI> you called upon us to
assist you, and not to suffer the <HI>French</HI> to march through our Country to
disturb any of your Settlements.</P>
<P>IN answer, We assure you we have all these Particulars in our Hearts,
they are fresh in our Memory. We shall never forget that you and we have
but one Heart, one Head, one Eye, one Ear, and one Hand. We shall
have all your Country under our Eye, and take all the Care we can to pre|vent
any Enemy from coming into it; and, in Proof of our Care, we must
inform you, that before we came here, we told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Onantio,</HI> the Governor of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">nad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"></HI></NOTE> <HI>Onantio,</HI> our Father, as
he is called, that neither he, nor any of his People, should come through
our Country, to hurt our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> or any of the Settlements
belonging to them; there was Room enough at Sea to fight, there he might
do what he pleased, but he should not come upon our Land to do any Da|mage
to our Brethren. And you may depend upon our using our utmost
Care to see this effectually done; and, in Token of our Sincerity, we pre|sent
you with this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After some little Time the Interpret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">r said, <HI>Canassatego</HI> had forgot some|thing
material, and desired to mend his Speech, and to do so as often as he
should omit any thing of Moment, and thereupon be added:</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Six Nations</HI> have a great Authority and Influence over sundry Tribes
of <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with the <HI>French,</HI> and particularly over the praying
<HI>Indians,</HI> formerly a Part with ourselves, who stand in the very Gates of the
<HI>French;</HI> and, to shew our further Care, we have engaged these very <HI>Indians,</HI>
and other <HI>Indian</HI> Allies of the <HI>French</HI> for you. They will not join the
<HI>French</HI> against you. They have agreed with us before we set out. We have
put the Spirit of Antipathy against the <HI>French</HI> in those People. Our Interest
is very considerable with them, and many other Nations, and as far as ever
it extends, we shall use it for your Service.</P>
<P>THE Governor said, <HI>Canassatego</HI> did well to mend his Speech; he might
always do it whenever his Memory should fail him in any Point of Conse|quence,
and he thanked him for the very agreeable Addition.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>You told us Yesterday, that all Disputes with you being now at an End,
you desired to confirm all former Treaties between <HI>Virginia</HI> and us, and to
make our Chain of Union as bright as the Sun.</P>
<P>WE agree very heartily with you in these Propositions; we thank you
for your good Inclinations; we desire you will pay no Regard to any idle
Stories that may be told to our Prejudice. And, as the Dispute about the
Land is now intirely over, and we perfectly reconciled, we hope, for the fu|ture,
we shall not act towards each other but as becomes Brethren and hearty
Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005416_0036_0F608E58EC3C9D90">
WE are very willing to renew the Friendship with you, and to make it as
firm as possible, for us and our Children with you and your Children to the
latest Generation, and we desire you will imprint these Engagements on
your Hearts in the strongest Manner; and, in Confirmation that we shall do
the same, we give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with <HI>Yo-hah</HI> from the Interpreter and all the Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>YOU did let us know Yesterday, that tho' you had been disappointed in
your Endeavours to bring about a Peace between us and the <HI>Catawbas,</HI> yet
you would still do the best to bring such a Thing about. We are well
pleased with your Design, and the more so, as we hear you know what sort
of People the <HI>Catawbas</HI> are, that they are spiteful and offensive, and have
treated us contemptuously. We are glad you know these Things of the <HI>Ca|tawbas;</HI>
we believe what you say to be true, that there are, notwithstand|ing,
some amongst them who are wiser and better; and, as you say, they
are your Brethren, and belong to the Great King over the Water, we shall
not be against a Peace on reasonable Terms, provided they will come to the
Northward to treat about it. In Confirmation of what we say, and to en|courage
you in your Undertaking, we give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>You told us likewise, you had a great House provided for the Education
of Youth, and that there were several white People and <HI>Indians</HI> Children
there to learn Languages, and to write and read, and invited us to send some
of our Children amongst you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WE must let you know we love our Children too well to send them so
great a Way, and the <HI>Indians</HI> are not inclined to give their Children Learn|ing.
We allow it to be good, and we thank you for your Invitation;
but our Customs differing from yours, you will be so good as to excuse us.</P>
<P>WE hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech">.</NOTE> <HI>Tarachawagon</HI> will be preserved by the good Spirit to a good
old Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">&punc; when he is gone under Ground, it will be then time enough to
look <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> for another; and no doubt but amongst so many Thousands as
there are in the World, one such Man may be found, who will serve both
Parties with the same Fidelity as <HI>Tarachawagon</HI> does; while he lives there
is no Room to complain. In Token of our Thankfulness for your Invita|tion,
we give you this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Ceremony.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Tocarrv-hogan,</P>
<P>YOU told us Yesterday, that since there was now nothing in Controversy
between us, and the Affair of the Land was settled to your Satisfaction,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ou would now brighten the Chain of Friendship which hath subsisted be|tween
<PB N="37" REF="005416_0037_0F608E59A6531C88">
you and us ever since we became Brethren; we are well pleased
with the Proposition, and we thank you for it; we also are inclined to re|new
all Treaties, and keep a good Correspondence with you. You told us
further, if ever we should perceive the Chain had contracted any Rust, to let
you know, and you would take care to take the Rust out, and preserve it
bright. We agree with you in this, and shall, on our Parts, do every thing
to preserve a good Understanding, and to live in the same Friendship with
you as with our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and <HI>Assaragoa;</HI> in Confirmation whereof, we
give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>On which the usual Cry of <HI>Yo-hah</HI> was given.</HI></P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>WE have now finished our Answer to what you said t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> us Yesterday, and
shall now proceed to <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, that are not of so general a Concern.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>THERE lives a Nation of <HI>Indians</HI> on the other Side of your Country,
the <HI>Tuscaroraes,</HI> who are our Friends, and with whom we hold Correspon|dence;
but the Road between us and them has been stopped for some
Time, on account of the Misbehaviour of some of our Warriors. We have
opened a new Road for our Warriors, and they shall keep to that; but as
that would be inconvenient for Messengers going to the <HI>Tuscaroraes,</HI> we de|sire
they may go the old Road. We frequently send Messengers to one ano|ther,
and shall have more Occasion to do so now that we have concluded
a Peace with the <HI>Cherikees.</HI> To enforce our Request, we give you this
String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Cry of Approbation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Assaragoa,</P>
<P>AMONG these <HI>Tuscaroraes</HI> there live a few Families of the <HI>Conoy Indians,</HI>
who are desirous to leave them, and to remove to the rest of their Nation
among us, and the straight Road from them to us lies through the Middle of
your Country. We desire you will give them free Passage through <HI>Virgini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">,</HI>
and furnish them with Passes; and, to enforce our Request, we give you
this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>Which was received with the usual Cry of Approbation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, Assarag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">a, <HI>and</HI> Tocarry-hogan,</P>
<P>AT the Close of your respective Speeches Yesterday, you made us very
handsome Present and we should return you something suitable to your
Generosity; but, alas, we are poor, and shall ever remain so, as long as
there are so many <HI>Indian</HI> Traders among us. Theirs and the white Peoples
Cattle have eat up all the Grass, and made Deer scarce. However, we have
Provided a small Present for you, and tho' some of you gave us more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
others, yet, as you are all equally our Brethren, we shall leave it to you to
divide it as you please.&mdash;And then presented three Bundles of Skins, which
were received with the usual Ceremony from the three Governm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005416_0038_0F608E5A74611690">
WE have one Thing further to say, and that is, We heartily recommend
Union and a good Agreement between you our Brethren. Never disagree,
but preserve a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">trict Friendship for one another, and thereby you, as well as
we, will become the stronger.</P>
<P>OUR wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the <HI>Five Na|tions;</HI>
this has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Au|thority
with our neighbouring Nations.</P>
<P>WE are a powerful Confederacy; and, by your observing the same Me|thods
our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and
Power; therefore whatever befals you, never fall out one with another.</P>
<P>The Governor replied:</P>
<P>THE honourable Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> have desired
me to speak for them; therefore I, in Behalf of those Governments; as well
as of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> return you Thanks for the many Proof&punc;
you have given in your Speeches of your Zeal for the Service of your Brethren
the <HI>English,</HI> and in particul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">r for your having so early engaged in a Neutra|lity
the several Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Alliance. We do not doubt
but you will faithfully discharge your Promises. As to your Presents, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
estimate these Things by their real Worth, but by the Disposition of the
Giver. In this Light we accept them with great Pleasure, and put a high
Value upon them. We are obliged to you for recommending Peace and good
Agreement amongst ourselves. We are all Subjects, as well as you, of the
Great King beyond the Water; and, in Duty to his Majesty, and from the
good Affection we bear to each other, as well as from a Regard to our own
Interest, we shall always be inclined to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech"> in Friendship.</P>
<P>THEN the Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> presented the Hundred Pounds in
Gold, together with a Paper, containing a Promise to recommend the <HI>Six
Nations</HI> for further Favour to the King; which they received with <HI>Yo-hah,</HI>
and the Paper was given by them to <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> to keep for them. The
Commissioners likewise promised that their publick Messengers should not be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">olested in their Passage through <HI>Virginia,</HI> and that they would prepare <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
for such of the <HI>Conoy Indians</HI> as were willing to remove to the Northward.</P>
<P>THEN the Commissioners of <HI>Maryland</HI> presented their Hundred Pounds
in Gold, which was likewise received with the <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cana<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">ateg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"></HI> said, We mentioned to you Yesterday the Booty you had taken
from the <HI>French,</HI> and asked you for some of the Rum which we supposed
to be Part of it, and you gave us some; but it turned out unfortunately
that you gave us it in <HI>French</HI> Glasses, we now desire you will give us some
in <HI>English</HI> Glasses.</P>
<P>THE Governor made answer, We are glad to hear you have such a Dislike
for what is <HI>French.</HI> They cheat you in your Glasses, as well as in every thing
else. You must consider we are at a Distance from <HI>Williamsburg, Annopoli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">,</HI>
and <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">iladelphia,</HI> where our Rum Stores are, and that altho' we brought up
a good Quantity with us, you have almost drunk it out; but, notwithstand|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech">g
this, we have enough left to fill our <HI>English</HI> Glasses, and will shew the
<PB N="39" REF="005416_0039_0F608E5BDA2D8DA8">
Difference between the Narrowness of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Generosity of
your Brethren the <HI>English</HI> towards you.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Indians</HI> gave, in their Order, five <HI>Yo-hahs;</HI> and the honourable Go|vernor
and Commissioners calling for some Rum, and some middle sized
Wine Glasses, drank Health to the <HI>Great King of</HI> ENGLAND and the <HI>Six
Nations,</HI> and put an End to the Treaty by three loud Huzza's, in which all
the Company joined.</P>
<P>IN the Evening the Governor went to take his Leave of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and,
presenting them with a String of Wampum, he told them, that was in return
for one he had received of them, with a Message to desire the Governor of
<HI>Virginia</HI> to suffer their Warriors to go through <HI>Virginia</HI> unmolested, which
was rendered unnecessary by the present Treaty.</P>
<P>THEN, presenting them with another String of Wampum, he told them,
that was in return for theirs, praying him, that as they had taken away one
Part of <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech">d Weiser</HI>'s Beard, which frightened their Children, he would
please to take away the other, which he had ordered to be done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> received these two Strings of Wampum with the usual <HI>Yo-hah.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor then asked them, what was the Reason that more of the
<HI>Shawanaes,</HI> from their Town on <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">hio,</HI> were not at the Treaty? But seeing
that it would require a Council in Form, and perhaps another Day to give an
Answer, he desired they would give an Answer to <HI>Conrad Wei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">er</HI> upon the
Road on their Return home, for he was to set out for <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the next
Morning.</P>
<P><HI>CANASSATEGO in Conclusion spoke as follows:</HI></P>
<P>WE have been hindered, by a great deal of Business, from waiting on you,
to have some private Conversation with you, chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">ly to enquire after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">
Healths of <HI>Onas</HI> beyond the Water; we desire you will tell them, we have a
grateful Sense of all their Kindnesses for the <HI>Indians.</HI> Brother <HI>Onas</HI> told u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">,
when he went away, he would not stay long from us; we think it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech">
great While, and want to kno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"> when we may expect him, and desire, when
you write, you will recommend us heartily to him; which the Governor pro|mised
to do, and then took his Leave of them.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners of <HI>Virginia</HI> gave <HI>Canassat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech"></HI> a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">arlet Camblet Coat,
and took their Leave of them in Form, and at the same time delivered the
Passes to them, according to their Request.</P>
<P>THE Commissioners of <HI>Maryland</HI> presented <HI>Gachrad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech">dow</HI> with a broad
Gold-laced Hat, and took their Leave of them in the same Manner.</P>
