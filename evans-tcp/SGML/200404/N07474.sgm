<HEAD>THE PROCEEDINGS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Attention of the public being at this Time entirely taken up with the affair of <HI>John Wilkes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> member of parliament for <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire;</HI> a gen|tleman of the greatest honor and abilities, and friend to liberty and his country, and a steady asserter of the invaluable rights and privileges of <HI>Englishmen;</HI> we hope the following impartial state of the case, and authentic account of all the proceedings and papers relative to that interesting and alarming en|croachment on the prerogative of the subject, late|ly exhibited by the most arbitrary and unjust ex|tension of power ever yet known, will meet with the approbation and protection of every honest man, and well-wisher to his Country.</P>
<P>Indeed such is the frame of our government, so prudently and strongly have our ancestors secured liberty and property (rescued by inches out of the hands of encroaching violence) that we cannot be enslaved but by chains of our own making. By the wisdom of our forefathers, the meanest
<PB N="4" REF="009542_0003_0F768BEF172EE7F0">
subject in this kingdom is protected from being given up as a prey to the arbitary pleasure, not only of the Prince, if he should attempt it, but (which is far more grievous) to the unreasonable passions and lusts of <HI>Favourites, Chief Ministers,</HI> and <HI>Women.</HI></P>
<P>There are three things that the Law of <HI>England</HI> (which is the law of <HI>Mercy</HI>) principally regards and takes care of, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Life, Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Estate.</HI> Next to a man's <HI>Life,</HI> is the <HI>freedom</HI> of his <HI>person;</HI> for what is imprisonment but a kind of civil death? And <HI>Fortescue,</HI> Cap. 42. justly remarks, <HI>Anglioe jura in omni casu libertati dant favorum.</HI> "The laws of <HI>England</HI> do, <HI>in all cases,</HI> favour liberty."</P>
<P>The Writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> is a remedy granted by the <HI>common</HI> law, for such as are unjustly de|tained in custody, to procure their liberty; but before this statute was rendered less useful than it ought to be, partly by the judges pretending a power to grant or deny the said writ at their plea|sure, in many cases; and especially by the ill practice of sheriffs and goalers, in putting the prisoner to the trouble of an <HI>alies</HI> and <HI>pluries;</HI> that is a second and third writ, before they would obey the first (as at that time there was no penalty till the third) and after all, the judges would fre|quently alledge, that they could not take bail, be|cause the party was a <HI>Prisoner of State,</HI> &amp;c. Therefore to remedy these inconveniencies, this wholesome law was provided. And as no man is sure but at one time or another he may have oc|casion
<PB N="5" REF="009542_0004_0F768BEFD2E05A08">
to make use of it, we shall give a brief ex|planation of it to the meanest capacities, by divid|ing it into its several branches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act concerneth either, 1. Persons committed for some other criminal, or supposed criminal matter, besides Treason or Fe|lony, and these are to have an <HI>Habeas</HI> immedi|ately. 2. Such who in their <HI>Mittimus</HI> are charg|ed with Treason or Felony; and these shall have the said writ after the time herein limited. 1. If any goaler, or under-keeper shall not deliver a true copy of the <HI>Mittimus</HI> within six hours after the prisoner demands it, the head goaler or keeper forfeits to the prisoner, for the first offence, the sum of 100<HI>l.</HI> for the second offence 200<HI>l.</HI> and loses his place; nor is there any fee to be paid for the same, the turnkey must deliver it at his peril.&mdash;<HI>Note,</HI> If any prisoner shall be locked up, or no one suffered to come near him, any friend may demand it on his behalf.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whatever the criminal matter may be, if Treason or Felony be not <HI>expresly</HI> charged, any person on the prisoner's behalf, carrying such true copy of the commitment to the Lord Chancellor, or any of the Judges, or Barons of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> or upon oath made that a copy was demanded, and denied, he shall grant an <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> or forfeit 500<HI>l.</HI> to the prisoner. But such request must be made in writing, and attested by two witnesses.</P>
<P N="3"> <PB N="6" REF="009542_0005_0F768BF091DBE258">3. If the sheriff or goaler do not carry up the prisoner, and return the true causes of his detainer within three days, if within 20 miles distance; or within ten days, if above 20 and under 100 miles; or within twenty days if above 100 miles, he for|feits 500<HI>l.</HI> to the prisoner.&mdash;<HI>Note,</HI> The prisoner must pay the charges of his carrying up, and the Judge when he grants the writ may order how much; but it must not be above 12d. a mile.</P>
<P>If upon the return of such <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> it ap|pears that the prisoner is not charged with Trea|son of Felony, especially and plainly expressed, or for such matters as by law are not bailable, the Judge shall discharge the prisoner on bail.</P>
<P N="4">4. If a person once so bailed out shall again be imprison'ed for the same offence, those that do it forfeit 500<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If there be High Treason for Felony, plainly and specially expressed, that is, not only gene|rally for Treason or Felony, but Treason in con|spiring to kill the King, or counterfeiting the King's coin, or Felony for stealing the goods of such an one to such a value, &amp;c. then the priso|ner cannot have his <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> till be has, on the first week of the Term, or first day of sessions of Oyer and Terminer, or general goal delivery, pertitioned in open court, to be brought to his trial the next term or sessions following; on the last day thereof he shall be bailed; and if not indicted the second term or sessions, shall be discharged.</P>

This act extends to all places within <HI>En|gland</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> the <HI>Tower</HI> cannot be supposed to be exempted, nor <HI>Windsor Castle,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anno 13. <HI>Rich.</HI> II. "It is ordained and assented, That the King's castles and goals, which were wont to be joined to the bo|dies of the counties, and be now severed, shall be rejoined to the same counties."</NOTE> nor any such royal forts, for the words are general. And be|sides, there is a special Act of Parliament, that unites the King's castles to the counties wherein they stand; there having formerly, it seems, been some pretensions, and ill practices, to hold them distinct, that therein they may detain priso|ners against law, and not admit any writ to en|large them.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> No person shall be sent prisoner out of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> into <HI>Scotland, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey,</HI> or any other place beyond the seas.</P>
<P>This Act took its rise in 1674, when it was calculated to set bounds to the arbitrary proceed|ings of Ministers. In 1679 the House of Com|mons brought in a bill for excluding placemen and pensioners from seats in Parliament. They also voted the standing army, and even the King's guards, to be illegal. But to compensate for the faction and violence into which they had been led by their prejudices, they got the ever-memorable <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act pasted into a law; which crowned the security of the subject, by ratifying one of the most essential parts of MACNA CHAR|TA, and the PETITION of RIGHTS.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009542_0007_0F768BF20E2A01D0">Having thus given a concise account of the above act, which we hope will not be unenter|taining to our Readers. We shall proceed with the case of Mr. <HI>Wilkes.</HI></P>
<P>The North-Briton of Saturday, April 23, 1763, was the cause of Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI>'s being taken into custody by a warrant from the Secretary of State, for writing the said paper; he was accordingly taken into custody on Saturday the 30th of April, and, after being examined, was committed to the Tower. The same afternoon and <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was granted by the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas.</P>

<HEAD>The NORTH BRITON, No. 45.</HEAD>
<P>THE King's Speech has always been considered by the legisla|ture, and by the public at large, as the speech of the Mi|nister.</P>
<P>This week has given the public the most abandoned instance of ministerial effrontery ever attempted to be imposed on mankind. I am in doubt, whether the imposition is greater on the Sovereign, or on the nation. Every friend of his country must lament that a Prince of so many great and amiable qualities, whom England truly revers, can be brought to give the sanction of his sacred name to the most odious measures, and to the most unjustifiable, public declarations, from a throne ever renowned for truth, honour, and unfullied virtue. I am sure, all foreigners, especially the King, of Prussia, will hold the Minister in contempt and abhorrence. He has made our Sove|reign declare, <HI>My expectations have been fully answered by the happy affects which the several allies of my crown have derived from this salu|tary measure of the</HI> definitive treaty. <HI>The Powers at war with my good brother, the King of Prussia, have been induced to agree to such terms of accommodations as that great Prince has approved; and the success which has attended by negociation has necessarily and immediately diffused the blessings of peace through every part of Europe.</HI> The infamous fallacy
<PB N="9" REF="009542_0008_0F768BF37272FE48">
of this whole sentence is apparent to all mankind: For it is known, that the King of Prussia did not barely <HI>approve</HI> but absolutely <HI>dic|tated,</HI> as conqueror, every article of the terms of peace. No advan|tage of any Kind has accrued to that magnanimous Prince from our negociations but he was basely deserted by the <HI>Scottish</HI> prime Mi|nister of England. He was known by every Court in Europe to be scarcely on better terms of friendship <HI>here,</HI> than at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and he was betrayed by us in the <HI>treaty of peace.</HI> What a strain of Insolence, therefore, is it in a Minister to lay claim to what he is conscious all his efforts tended to prevent, and meanly to arrogate to himself a share in the fame and glory of one of the greatest Princes the world has ever seen? The Kings of Prussia, however, has gloriously kept <HI>all</HI> his former conquests, and stipulated security for all his allies, even for the Elector of Hanover. I know in what light this great Prince is considered in Europe, and what manner he has been treated here; among other reasons, perhaps, from some contemtu|ous expressions he may have used of the <HI>Scot:</HI> Expressions which are every day echoed by the whole Body of Englishmen through the southern part of this island.</P>
<P>The Preliminary articles of peace were such as have drawn the contempt of mankind on our wretched negociators. All our most valuable conquests were agreed to be restored, and the East India company would have been infallibly ruined by a single article of this fallacious and baneful negociation. No hireling of the Ministry has been hardy enough to dispute this; yet the Minister himself has made our Sovereign declare, <HI>the satisfaction which he felt at the approaching re-establishment of peace upon conditions so honourable to his crown, and so beneficial to his people.</HI> As to the <HI>entire approbation</HI> of parliament, which he so vainly boasted of, the world knows how that was obtained. The large debt on the <HI>civil list,</HI> already half a year in arrear, shews pretty clearly the Transactions of the Winter. It is, however, remarkable, that the Minister's speech dwells on the <HI>entire approbation</HI> given by parliament to the preliminary articles, which I will venture to say, he must by this time be ashamed of; for he has been brought to confess the total want of that knowledge and Precision, by which such immense advantages both of trade and territory, were sacrificed to our inveterate enemies. These gross Blunders are, indeed, in some measure set right by the definitive treaty; yet the most important articles, relative to <HI>cessions, commerce,</HI> and FISHERY, remain as they were, with respect to the French. The proud and feeble <HI>Spaniard</HI> too does not RENOUNCE, but only DESPOTS <HI>from all pretensions, which be may have formed, to the right of fishing</HI>&mdash;where? Only <HI>about the island of</HI> NEWFOUNDLAND&mdash;till a favourable opportunity arises of <HI>insisting</HI> on it, <HI>there, as well as elsewhere.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009542_0009_0F768BF3ECAADC38">The Minister cannot forbear, even in the <HI>King's Speech,</HI> insulting us with a dull repetition of the word <HI>Oeconomy.</HI> I did not expect soon to have seen the more again, after it had been so excluded, and more than once, by a numerous audience, <HI>hissed</HI> off the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 word"> of our <HI>English</HI> theatres. Let the publick be informed of a single Instance of <HI>oeconomy,</HI> except indeed in the houshold: Is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 word"> which was compleated as to its compliment of officers, on the Tuesday, and broke on the Thursday, a proof of <HI>oeconomy?</HI> In the pay of the <HI>Scottish Master Elliot</HI> to be voted by an <HI>English</HI> parliament under the head of <HI>oeconomy?</HI> Is this, among a thousand others, one of the con|vincing proofs of a <HI>firm resolution to form government on a plan of strict oeconomy?</HI> Is it not notorious, that in the reduction of the army, not the least attention has been paid to it? Many unnecessary ex|pences have been incurred, only to increase the power of the crown, that is to create more lucrative jobs for the creatures of the minister, The <HI>Staff</HI> indeed is broke, but the discerning part of mankind im|mediately comprehended the mean subterfuge, and resented the in|dignity put upon so brave on Officer, as Marshal Ligonier. The step was taken to give the whole power of the army to the crown, that is to the minister. Lord Ligonier is now no longer at the head of the army; but Lord <HI>Bute</HI> in effect is: I mean that every preser|ment given by the crown will be found still to be obtained by <HI>his</HI> enormous influence, and to be bestowed only on the creatures of the <HI>Scottish</HI> faction. The nation is still in the same deplorable state, while <HI>he</HI> governs, and can make the tools of his power pursue the same odious measure. Such a retreat, as he intends, can only mean that personal indemnity, which, I hope, guilt will never find from an injured nation. The negociations of the late inglorious <HI>Peace,</HI> and the <HI>Excise,</HI> will haunt him wherever he goes; and the terrors of the just resentment which the must be in to meet from a brave and insulted people, and which must finally crush him, will be for ever before his eyes.</P>
<P>In vain will such a minister, or the soul dregs of his power, the tools of corruption and despotism, preach up in <HI>the speech</HI> that <HI>spirit of concord, and that obedience to the laws, which is essential to good order.</HI> They have sent the <HI>spirit of discord</HI> through the land, and I will proprecy, that it will never be extinguished, but by the extinc|tion of their power. Is the <HI>Spirit of Concord</HI> to go hand in hand with the PEACE and EXCISE through this nation? It is to be expected between an insolent EXCISEMAN, and as <HI>Peer, Gentleman, Freeholder,</HI> or <HI>Farmer,</HI> whose private houses are now made liable to be emered and searched at pleasure? <HI>Gloucestershire, Herefordshire,</HI> and is general all the <HI>Cyder</HI> countries, are not sarely the <HI>serveral countries</HI> which are alluded to in the <HI>speach.</HI> The <HI>spirit of concord</HI> had not gone forth among them, but the <HI>spirit of liberty</HI> has,
<PB N="11" REF="009542_0010_0F768BF454372008">
and a noble opposition has been given to the wicked instruments of opression.</P>
<P>A despotic minister will always endeavour to dazzle his prince with high flown ideas of <HI>prerogative</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> of the <HI>crown,</HI> which the minister will make a parade of <HI>firmly maintaining.</HI> I wish as much as any man in the kingdom, to see <HI>the honour of the crown</HI> maintained in a manner truly becoming <HI>Royalty.</HI> I lament to see it sunk even to prostitution. What a shame was it to see the security of this country, in point of military force, complimented away, contrary to the opinion of Royalty itself, and sacrificed to the pre|judices and to the ignorance of a set of people, the most unfit from every consideration to be consulted on a Matter relating to the se|curity of the <HI>House of Hanover?</HI> I wish to see <HI>the honour of the crown</HI> religiously asserted with regard to our allies, and the dignity of it scrupulously maintained with regard to foreign Princes. Is it possible such an indignity can have happened; such a sacrifice of <HI>the crown of England,</HI> as that a minister should already have kissed his Majesty's hand on being appointed to the most insolent and ungrateful court in the world, without a previous assurance of that reciprocal nomi|nation which the meanest court in Europe would insist upon, before the proceeded to act otherwise so derogatory to her honour? But <HI>Electo|ral Policy</HI> has ever been obsequious to the court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and for|gets the insolence with which <HI>Count Colloredo</HI> left England. Upon a principle of <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>oeconomy,</HI> Lord <HI>Stormont, a Scottish</HI> Poer, of the loyal house of <HI>Murray,</HI> kissed his Majesty's hand, I think, on Wednesday in the <HI>Easter</HI> Week; but this ignominious act has not disgraced the nation in the <HI>London Gazette.</HI> The ministry are not ashamed of doing the thing in private; they are only afraid of the publication. Was it a tender regard for the honour of the late King, or of his present Majesty, that invited to court <HI>Lord George Sackville, in these first days of peace;</HI> to share in the general satisfaction, which all good countiers received in the indignity offered to Lord <HI>Ligonier,</HI> and on the advancement of&mdash;&mdash;? Was this to shew <HI>princely</HI> gratitude to the eminent service of the accomplished Gene|ral of the house of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> who has had so great a share in rescu|ing <HI>Europe</HI> from the Yoke of <HI>France;</HI> and whose nephew we hope soon to see made happy in the possession of the most amiable Prin|cess in the World? Or, is it meant to assert <HI>the honour of the crown</HI> only, against the united wishes of a loyal and affectionate people, founded in a happy experience of the talents, ability, integrity, and virtue of those who have had the glory of redeeming their country from bondage and ruin, in order to support, by every art of corrup|tion and intimidation, a weak, disjointed, incapable set of&mdash;&mdash;I will call them any thing but <HI>Ministers</HI>&mdash;by whom the <HI>Favourite</HI> still meditates to rule this kingdom with a rod of iron.</P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Officers had a <HI>verbal</HI> order to put this warrant in execution, by entering forceably into the house of <HI>John Wilkes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Member of Parliament,</HI> at midnight; and those officers are (the hand bill says) now threatened with the loss of their places, for not complying with such <HI>ver|bal</HI> Instructions.</P>
<P>On the intimation of Mr. <HI>Wilkes, Member of Parliament,</HI> being in custody, a motion was made in the Court of Common Pleas, then fitting in Westminster-Hall, for a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> which was
<PB N="14" REF="009542_0013_0F768BF692C2B818">
<HI>granted;</HI> though by reason of the prothonotory's office not being open, such <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> could not be sued out till four o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Several Gentlemen, Friends, and Acquaintance of the said <HI>John Wilkes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Member of Parlia|ment,</HI> applied for admittance into his house, which was then peremptorily refused by a <HI>pretended</HI> order from the Secretary of State; which order, though repeatedly requested, was not, nor could not be produced.</P>
<P>As no proper of <HI>legal</HI> authority appeared to countenance such refusal, the Gentlemen thought themselves no ways obliged to obey the <HI>verbal</HI> commands of officers acting only under <HI>verbal</HI> au|thority; and entered accordingly without further question or molestation from <HI>those</HI> officers.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the Deputy Secretary of State, be|ing sent for, demanded the reason of such <HI>forcible</HI> entry: It was replied, that <HI>no</HI> force had been used, and that the Gentlemen thought themselves <HI>legally</HI> justified in what <HI>They</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Soon after this (whether sent for, or not, does not appear) <HI>Phillip Carteret Webb,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Solicitor to the Treasury, came into the room, and some private conversation between him and Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> having past, the latter asked, if any Gentleman then present would attend or inspect the officers while they were sealing up all the papers in the house of Mr. <HI>Wilkes;</HI> or used words to the like effect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> having declined to accept of the like offer, no person then present thought himself au|thorized to take upon him such inspection.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="009542_0014_0F768BF84F916D88">Notwithstanding it was known, that the Court of Common Pleas had granted an <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> of which fact <HI>Philip Carteret Webb,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Solici|tor to the Treasury, at that time at Lord <HI>Halifax'</HI>s, was <HI>then</HI> well assured; yet was the said <HI>John Wilkes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Member of Parliament,</HI> committed to the Tower of London.</P>
<P>His Solicitor and one of his council, soon after they heard of such commitment, went to the Tower, in order to consult with the said <HI>John Wilkes,</HI> about the <HI>legal</HI> methods to be pursued for his enlargement; but were denied admittance; Major <HI>Ransford</HI> informed them, that he had re|ceived <HI>orders</HI> from the <HI>Secretary of State,</HI> not to admit <HI>any person whatsoever,</HI> to speak with, or see the said <HI>John Wilkes:</HI> And further informed them, that he has just before refused the right honoura|ble the <HI>Earl of Temple</HI> such admittance.</P>

<P>After such denial, Mr. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s Solicitor de|manded of the Major, a copy of the warrant un|der which Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> was committed to the Tow|er; which was readily granted by the Major, and of which the following is a true copy.</P>

As an Englishman, I must lament that my liberty is thus wickedly taken away. Yet I am not unhappy, for my honor is clear, my health good, and my spirit unshaken, I believe, indeed, invincible.

<P>On <HI>Tuesday, May</HI> 3, at half an hour past ten in the morning, Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> was brought to the Bar of the Court of Common Pleas, where he made the following Speech, truly becoming a Man, and a member of the House of Commons.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Feel myself happy to be at last brought before a Court, and be|fore Judges, whose Characteristic is the love of liberty. I have many humble thanks to return for the immediate order you were pleased to issue, to give me an opportunity, of laying my grievances before you. They are of a kind hitherto unparalleled in this free country, and I trust the consequences will teach ministers of <HI>Scottish</HI> and arbitrary principles, that the liberty of an <HI>English</HI> subject is not to be sported away with impunity, in this cruel and despotic manner.</P>
<P>I am accused of being the author of the <HI>North Briton,</HI> No. 45. I shall only remark upon that paper, that it takes all load of accula|tion from the sacred name of a prince, whose family I love and ho|nor, as the glorious defenders of the cause of liberty, whose perso|nal qualities are to amiable, great, and respectable, that he is de|servedly the idol of his people. It is the peculiar fashion and crime of these times, and of those who hold high ministerial offices in go|vernment, to throw every odious charge from themselves upon Majesty. The author of this paper, whoever he may be, has, upon constitutional principles, done directly the reverse, and is therefore in me, the supposed author, meant to be persecuted accordingly.</P>
<P>The particular cruelties of my treatment, worse than if I have been a <HI>Scots</HI> rebel, this court will hear, and I dare say, from your justice, in due time redress.</P>
<P>I may perhaps still have the means left me to shew that I have been superior to every temptation of corruption. They may indeed have flattered themselves, that when they found <HI>corruption</HI> could not prevail, <HI>persecution</HI> might intimidate. I will shew myself superior to both, my <HI>papers</HI> have been seized, perhaps with a hope the better to deprive me of that proof of their meanness, and corrupt pro|digality, which it may possibly, in a proper place, be yet in my power to give.</P>

<HEAD>The CONTRAST.</HEAD>
<P>COL. WILKES is a contrast to those that have been prisoners, in that repository of <HI>rebellious</HI> and <HI>tyrannical</HI> SCOTS, the <HI>Tower,</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>He is a staunch Whig; they were notorious Jacobites.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009542_0023_0F768BFFA7372B58">He is zealously attached to our present royal fa|mily of Brunswick, the glorious maintainers of our civil and religious rights.They were bigot|ted to the tyrant family of the Stuarts, who for repeated attempts to enslave a free people, and re|duce them to the state of SCOTCH VASSALS, was BANISHED.</P>
<P>His conduct has been steady. He was a Whig by family, and he remains so, though Whigs are discarded, and Tories promoted. He was a Whig in 1745, when the Scotch were in Arms against our KING, our LAWS, and our RELIGION. He was at that time a friend to LIBERTY. When the Scotch were in arms, in the cause of <HI>Popery, Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power.</HI> He was a Friend, may he revered the Duke of Cumberland, because he crushed the Scotch Rebellion; for which rea|son he is deserted by the Scotch.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s Attachments to the present Royal Family has been gratis: Where is the SCOT that can say the same?</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> with all his true English Merit, his Zeal for our KING, his Detestation of his MI|NISTRY; his Opposition to the <HI>Extension</HI> of the EXCISE; his Support of the LIBERTY of the PRESS; his Attention to the Privilege of PARLIA|MENT; and his Attachment to the HABEAS COR|PUS, is, in the Scotch Administration, rewarded with being a close Prisoner in the <HI>Tower,</HI> and treated with a Severity unknown to a Rebel SCOT.

<P>I, and every other WHIG, and true <HI>Englishman</HI> most devoutly pray for the Welfare of our present excellent Sovereign GEORGE the THIRD; and that his Reign may be long, and happy. To ob|tain the latter, they with him a Ministry not to|tally obnoxious to the People; nor absolutely ig|norant of their duty, not quite regardless of our liberties.

<P>FAR be it from me to regret that I have passed so many more days in <HI>Captivity,</HI> as it will have afferded you an opportunity of doing, upon mature reflection, and repeated examination, the more signal justice to my <HI>Country.</HI> The <HI>Liberty</HI> of all Peers, and Gentlemen, and what touches me more sensibly, that of all the midling and inferior class of people, who stand most in need of pro|tection, is in my case this day to be finally decided upon: A ques|tion of such importance as to determine at once whether <HI>English</HI> Li|berty be a Reality or a Shadow.

Such inhuman principles of <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> Tyranny will, I trust, by <HI>This Court,</HI> upon this solemn occasion, be finally extirpated, and henceforth every innocent man, however poor and unsupported, may hope to sleep in peace and security in his own house, unviolated, by <HI>King's Messengers</HI> and the <HI>arbitrary Mand&aacute;ates</HI> of an over-bearing <HI>Secretary of State.</HI></P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> had made an end, that dis|tinguished ornament to justice and humanity, Lord Chief Justice <HI>Pratt,</HI> stood up, and delivered the opinion of the Court to the following purport, arranging the matter in question under these three separate heads.</P>
<P>First, The legality of Mr. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s Commitment.</P>
<P>Secondly, the necessity for a specification of those particular passages in the 45th number of the NORTH BRITON, which had been deem'd a Libel. And,</P>
<P>Thirdly, Mr. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s Privilege as a Member of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009542_0026_0F768C01DA33BBB0">In regard to the first, his Lordship remarked, That he would consider a Secretary of State's Warrant thro' the whole Affair, as nothing supe|rior to the Warrant of a common Justice of the Peace; and that no Magistrate had in reality a Right <HI>ex officio</HI> to apprehend any Person, without stating the particular Crime of which he was ac|cused; but at the same Time he observed there were many Precedents where a nice Combination of Circumstances gave so strong a suspicion of Facts, that tho' that Magistrate could not be justi|fied <HI>ex officio,</HI> he was nevertheless supported in the Commitment, even without receiving any particu|lar Information for the Foundation of his Charge. The Word <HI>Charge,</HI> his Lordship took Notice, was in general much misunderstood, and did not mean the <HI>Accusation</HI> brought against any Person taken up, but his <HI>Commitment</HI> by the Magistrate before whom be might be brought. Upon the Whole of this Point, according to the customary Rule, which had been for a Series of Years observed by the Sages of the Law, even in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when this Matter was to frequently contested, his Lordship was of Opinion, that Mr. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s Commitment was not illegal.</P>
<P>In relation to the next Article, which required a Specification of the particular Passages in the 45th <HI>North Briton,</HI> which were deemed a Libel, his Lordship took Notice that the Insertion of these Passages, so far as they related to the Point in Question, was not at all necessary; for even sup|posing the Whole of the 45th <HI>North Briton</HI> had been 
<PB N="28" REF="009542_0027_0F768C0294E48A90">
inserted in the Body of the Warrant, yet it by no Means came under his Lordship's Cognizance at that Time; for the Matter in Consideration then was, not the Nature of the Offence, but the Le|gality of the Commitment; the Nature of the Offence not resting in the Bosom of a Judge, without the Assistance of a Jury; and not being a proper subject of Enquiry, till regularly bro't on to be tried, in the customary Way of Proceeding.</P>
<P>With respect to the third and last Point, How far, Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> had a Right to plead his privilege as a Member of Parliament, my Lord Chief Jus|tice remarked, that there were but three Cases which could possibly affect the Privilege of a Mem|ber of Parliament, and these were <HI>Treason, Felony,</HI> and the <HI>Peace.</HI> The Peace as it is written in the Institutes of the Law, his Lordship explained to signify a <HI>Breach of the Peace:</HI> He remarked, that when the Seven Bishops were sent to the Tower, the Plea which was used when the Spiritual Lords contended for their Privilege, was, that they had <HI>endeavoured</HI> to <HI>disturb</HI> the Peace. This, at that Arbitrary Time, was judged sufficient to forfeit their Privilege, but remarked his Lordship, out of the four Judges then upon the Bench, there was but one honest Man; that was <HI>Powel,</HI> and he declined giving any Opinion. This great and good Man then answered, that the Privilege of Parliament should be held sacred and inviolable, and as there were but three particular Cases in which that Privilege was forfeited, it only remain|ed to examine how far Mr. <HI>Wilkes'</HI>s was endanger|ed. 
<PB N="29" REF="009542_0028_0F768C0374AEA9F0">
Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> stood accused of writing a Libel, a Libel in the Sense of the Law was a <HI>High Mis|demeanour;</HI> but did not come within the Descrip|tion of <HI>Treason, Felony,</HI> or <HI>Breach of the Peace,</HI> At most it had but a tendency to <HI>disturb</HI> the <HI>Peace,</HI> and consequently could not be sufficient to destroy the Privilege of a Member of Parliament.</P>
<P>Thus this Point of Privilege was determined, and Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> immediately discharged, through the universal Acclamations of an incredible Num|ber of Spectators, all impatient to know the Re|sult of so important a Question. He had however been scarcely discharged, when a Gentleman of Eminence in the Law stood up, and told my Lord Chief Justice, that he had just received a Note from the Attorney and Solicitor General, to in|treat his Lordship would not give Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> leave to depart till their coming, which would be instant, as they had something to offer against his Plea of Privilege. The Motion was however heartily laughed at by the whole Court, as that Gentleman had been discharged already, and the Question finally ended.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to do sufficient Honour to that amazing Power of Elocution, and Depth of Un|derstanding which My Lord Chief Justice displayed upon this Occasion; he was florid without Parade, and profound without Oftentation; to say all, in one Word, he was a perfect Image of Integrity the most refined, and Wisdom the most elegant. After the Court had proceeded to give their Opini|on, and Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> was ordered to be <HI>discharged,</HI> 
<PB N="30" REF="009542_0029_0F768C0426355770">
he then addressed himself to the Court in the Words following:</P>

Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> said some little Time in a Room adjoining to the Court, in Expectation that the Croud would disperse: At last, finding there was no Likelihood of their dispersing, he walked out of the back Door of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and was received by a prodigious multitude of People, who attended him, amidst continual Acclamations, to his House in <HI>Great George|Street, Westminster.</HI> As soon as he got in, he went into his Dining Room fronting the Street, and throwing open his Windows, politely paid his Compliments to the People, who joined in the most ser|vent Prayers and Wishes for the Continuance of his Health and Life.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Having given the foregoing candid and complete Account of the Proceedings relative to Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> we cannot quit the Subject without making some Reflections on this unconstitutional Affair.</P>
<P>By the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> every Man is sup|posed to be innocent, till it be proved that he is guilty, and has a Right, when accused of any Crime, to make Use of the best Means he can for his Defence. This fundamental Principle was so far violated in the Case of Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> that, for more than two Days, he was denied the Privi|lege of seeing any Person whatsoever. This surely is making an <HI>English</HI> Prison but little better than the <HI>French</HI> Bastile, where Men are often taken up, confined, and executed, without so much as know|ing any Thing of the Crime they are charged with, or even seeing the Face of their Accusers.</P>
<P>Justice and Humanity demands that every man should be allowed the Advice and Assistance of his Friends, to clear up his Character and Repu|tation to the World. It is the Business of Justice to furnish every Opportunity, instead of denying it; and whenever a man is refused this, we can't avoid thinking that his Enemies are less solicitous about the Nature of his Offence, than studious about his destruction; and that so far from pro|secuting from and equitable View, they rather pro|ceed from Motives of a Nature easily to be guessed at, though not so safe to be named.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="009542_0031_0F768C05A78CE890">It is impossible for a man to make a regular Defence without the Help of legal Advice. There|fore to refuse a Prisoner the Benefit of Council, is diametrically opposite to the fundamental Spirit of the British Constitution, which, so far from wanting to condemn, wishes nothing more than to give every Advantage of proving the Innocence of the unhappy Culprit: For if a man is not al|lowed to prepare for his Defence, Sentence may as well pass upon him at once, without the useless Parade and idle Formality of a Trial. How far this had like to have been the Case with Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> let every unbiassed Person decide within himself, had not the spirited and patriotic Efforts of Lord <HI>Temple,</HI> and other noble Patrons of Liberty, gone Hand in Hand with his Resolution, Steadiness, and persevering Disposition.</P>
<P>What heavier Crime can be laid to a Subject's Charge than Treason against so gracious a Sove|reign as this Nation is at present blessed with?&mdash;And what Reparation is to be made Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> for the Confinement of his Person, and Injury in|tended his Character? Shall a British Senator suf|fer such Violence and Indignity without finding Redress from the Laws of his Country, merely for standing foremost in the Cause of Liberty!&mdash;Forbid it Heaven!</P>
<P>It we look through the whole Course of Mr. <HI>Wilkes's</HI> Life, we shall find that Liberty has been the governing Principle of all his Actions. He has always been ready to serve our gracious Sove|reign and his Family, knowing his Government
<PB N="33" REF="009542_0032_0F768C064DB08440">
to be founded on Liberty. His was the daring Task to rescue the Royal Person from ill-placed Imputations, and fix them on the Ministers, who alone ought to bare the Blame, nay, the Punish|ment, of their unconstitutional Proceedings. He had the Virtue in these Days of Corruption, to re|sist the most advantageous and lucrative Offers, in order to seduce him to their Party; and rather than associate with Men, who are Enemies to the Liberty of this Country, he chose to suffer the se|verest Persecutions. Hitherto he has had the Happiness to surmount every Difficulty, in a Man|ner becoming an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and the Friend and Guardian of our Liberties; and as the Validity of the Warrant by which he was committed, will soon be called in Question by Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> in the Court of <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> we shall say no more on that Head, until its Legality shall have received a Judicial Determination in that Court; when we shall resume the Subject, and give a further Ac|count of the Affair.</P>
<P>We shall conclude at present with some enter|taining Pieces relative to the Subject:</P>
<LETTER>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take this publick Occasion to congratulate you upon your having been committed to the <HI>Tower;</HI> and to express my Gratitude to you, as I am an Individual of this Free People, of
<PB N="34" REF="009542_0033_0F768C07DF91E4D8">
whose Rights and Liberties you stand forth as a Zealous Asserter.</P>
<P>To suffer in the Cause of Virtue, and of public Virtue in particular, is the highest Merit, but be|ieve me, Sir, ministerial Rage has done quite another Thing than it intended; it has committed an Act, which has laid a certain Foundation for transmitting your Name to Posterity, among the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> of Patriots famous for the Love of their country. The Liberty of the Subject has been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters">acked in your Person; and is therefore concern|ed in your Safety; and there is not a Man in <HI>En|gland</HI> who has not been conversant in Bribery or corruption, or the Writer or Tool of such, but will hereafter mention your Name with Love and Honor.</P>
<P>Vain have been the Attempts, and (if there be any judging with Certainty of the human Kind) always vain will be any Attempts to brand you with Disaffection to your Sovereign. Those who know you well, must testify your Loyalty, Affec|tion, and Zeal for his most gracious Majesty, and the illustrious House of <HI>Hanover;</HI> and your pub|lick Conduct has been constantly animated by Re|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="3 letters">tion Principles (the only Support of this free Nation) which will never admit the Glory and Honour of the Crown, and the Prosperity and happiness of the People, to have opposite or diffe|rent Interests, or that either can flourish while the other languishes; and there is not a Man of Sense who is your Opposer, but is in his Consci|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters">en convinced that such are your Principles,

though he be too much warped by Prejudice arising from private Views, to allow you your just Ap|plause.</P>
<P>When such Men as you charge evil Ministers with pernicious Measures, their trite Artifice you know is to cry out that Disrespect is levelled at the Sovereign, and the Measures imputed to him What is this, but in Effect vesting themselves with Sovereignity! But as we all know that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> is fenced about by our Laws in so sacred a Man|ner, that it is impossible for him to do wrong and that every Misconduct is therefore charges upon the Minister only, who advises; that M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="3 letters">|ter who tells his Sovereign that bad Measures, imputed to him, taking Shelter at the same Time under his Wing; this, I say, is the proper <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> upon whom the Violation of Majesty should charged: This is he who should be deemed guilty of Tr&mdash;son.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy circumstance which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> almost all Princes, that from the Instant they be to govern, they are forever precluded from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> Advantages of sincere Friendship, and are sur|rounded only by those who act from no other Motives than those of Self-interest and Design and are under a Necessity to conduct themselves by the Informations of such. Go on then, gene|rous Sir, to exert that honest and active Spirit which has already gained you so great an Intend in the Hearts of your Fellow-subjects, as by your Perseverance in public Virtue will doubtless be|come universal: Assert the Rights of your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word">

citizens, and keep a watchful and jealous Eye over the Servants of your Prince, and bring into the Light the iniquitous Attempts of corrupt Mi|nisters, to separate the Interest and Glory of his Majesty from the Prosperity and Happiness of his People, or to raise Distrusts between them: This will make those of your Fellow-subjects who shall never see your Person, take Pleasure in your Name, and call your their Friend; and will gain you an Appellaition of the truest and greatest Honour in Human Life, that is a Guardian of the Rights of a Free People.</P>

<P>"He ought not to speak Evil of the Ruler of the People, to cause Disaffection, or to raise Cla|mour, Murmurs of Discontent. He that ruleth with Justice, Judgement and Righteousness, is in|titled not only to our Obedience, but to our Ap|plause."</P>
<P>"He ought not to solicit any one to sell his Vote or Interest either in or out of Parliament. A free Election, and an uncorrupt Parliament is the best Security of our Constitution."</P>
<P>"He ought not to commend bad Men, nor bad Measures; nor defend Men in Power, whose Actions discover their Ignorance or bad Intentions."</P>
<P>"He ought not to favour passive Obedience, and Non-resistance; or to deny the Subject his Right to petition to the King against any Usurpa|tion upon Liberty in a free State. One Step more would reconcile such Advocates to Insallibility: For, if the Subject must take every Thing upon the Word and Authority of a Minister, it is no Matter whether he lives at <HI>London,</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI>"</P>
<P>"He particularly ought to be cautious whom he commends; for very often Praises, where not deserved, fit as aukwardly upon the great Man,

<P>I HAD not, till Yesterday, the Honour of your Lordship's Let|ter of the 12th, and embrace this earliest Opportunity of acknow|ledging it. Your Lordship has not yet, in my poor Idea, as|certained the Right you claim in interrogating me about the Paper of the 21st of August, and I will first know the very good Authority on which I am thus questioned, before I will return any Answer Whatever.</P>
<P>Your Lordship desires me to write or send to your as soon as I have determined what Part I shall act. I intended my first Letter should have made that sufficiently clear.</P>

<P>I HAVE this Instant received your's of the 16th, it is your own Declaration before Men of Truth and Honor, that you occasionally assisted the Paper called <HI>The North-Briton</HI> with your Pen:
<PB N="46" REF="009542_0045_0F768C1132767500">
That is the Foundation of my interrogating you about the <HI>North-Briton</HI> of the 21st of <HI>August</HI>&mdash;and whatever may be your Idea, mine is, that, when a Gentleman owns himself an occasional Author of an anonymous satirical Paper, any Person by Name ridiculed in such an Hebdomadal Perfor|mance hath a Right to ask the occasional avowed Writer, if he was the Author of the offending Paper.</P>
<P>You may now, Sir, answer my Question or not, I have offered to put myself on that Footing with you, that became a Man who hath Spirit, and is influenced by Honour&mdash;If you do not deny the Paper, I must and will conclude you wrote it.</P>

<P>SUNDAY's Post brought me your Lordship's of the 17th, and by the Return of it this waits on your Lordship.</P>
<P>You are pleased to say that it is my own Declaration before Men of Honour, that I occasionally assisted the Paper called The North-Briton. I wish your Lordship had been more explicit, and had mentioned the Name of any one Gentleman before whom I made that Declaration. Was it made in publick? Or was it in private Conversation? Still I have the Misfortune of not yet seeing your Lordship's Right of putting the Question to me about the Paper of the 21st of August, and till I do, I will never resolve your Lordship on that Head, though I would any Friend I have in the World, who had the Curiosity of asking me, if it was in a civil Manner.</P>
<P>Your Lordship says, that if I do not deny the Paper, you must and will conclude I wrote it. Your Lordship has my free Consent to make any Conclusions you think proper, whether they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="2 words"> or ill grounded; and I feel the most perfect Indifference about what they are, or the Consequences of them.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="009542_0046_0F768C118EB34670">I intend at present to make a Tour on Thursday to the Isle of Wight. I shall return to this City the Beginning of the next Week.</P>

<P>LORD Talbot by your Message has at last brought this im|portant Question to the precite Point, where my first Answer to his Lordship fixed it, if he preferred that. As you have only seen the two last Letters. I must entreat you to cast your Eye over those proceeding, because I apprehend they will justly an Obser|vation or two I made this Morning, when I had the Honor of pay|ing my Compliments to you at Camp.</P>
<P>Be assured that if I am between Heaven and Earth, I will be on Tuesday Evening at Tilbury's, the Red Lion at Bagshot, and on Wednesday Morning will play this Duet with his Lordship.</P>

<P>This will be delivered to your by my Adjutant, who attends me to Bagshot. I shall not bring any Servant with me, From the Fear of any of the Parties being known. My Pistols only, or his Lord|ship's, at his Option, shall decide this Point.</P>
