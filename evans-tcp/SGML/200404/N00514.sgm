<P>TO the end that all Impartial People may have a right und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|standing in the present Prosecution, I intend to give a short Relation of the first rise and cause and ground of this pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|sent Difference, and Persecution.</P>
<P>In the Year 1689. by the good Providence of God <HI>George Keith</HI> was earnestly invited to remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from his Plantation in <HI>East-Iarsey,</HI> to keep a School in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which he did; but kept an Usher and spent a great part of his time in Reading, Meditation, Visiting Mee|tings, and answering the Conscientious Doubts and Questions of many People; and there was a more than ordinary seeming Satisfaction in general among the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> that they were so favoured with the assistance of <HI>George Keith.</HI> But alas! this great lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was but short liv'd; and as in other Cases one Extream beget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the con|trary, so in this; for their love and respects to him were never so great, but now the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vy and Hatred of many exceeds; and that upon the account of his Christian Testimony.

K. <HI>like a Rude man, tho' he pretends to be a Minister, was so far from behaving himself before the Governour like a C ristian, that he fell a Reviling him, and amongst other scandalous Expressions, said to him, Thou Impudent Man, thou art not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to be Governour, thy Name will stink:</HI> Certainly their drif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to possess the Readers with this Belief, as is clear and evident from their following supposition, or rather suggestion, where they say, <HI>He that useth such Exorbitancy of Speech to the Governour, will easily dare to call the Members of Council and Magistrates Impudent Rascals, as he hath lately called one in on open Assembly, who was constituted by the Governour to be a Magistrate.</HI> Which also is a base and wicked Insinuation; for <HI>George Keith</HI> never spoke those words to any of them as Magistrates or Officers in the Government, neither did he ever speak to the present Governour all those words together, as is insinuated by the said Paper, but on the contrary, what he spoke to <HI>Tho.

times, <HI>That he would take no advantage by words spoke at such times,</HI> but we find them practise the contrary; for on a certain time <HI>T. L.</HI> stood up, and affirmed, <HI>That</HI> G.

And as touching the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they say, he call'd, <HI>Impudent Rascal,</HI> it was one whom he know not to be constituted, as they say he was; but his Brother being so constituted, and refusing to serve, the People of the Town chose him in his Brothers stead to serve as a Magistrate within that Town bounds, which was altogether unknown to G. K. and therefore <HI>Paul</HI>'s excuse, <HI>Acts</HI> 23 4. <HI>I wist not Brethren that it was the High Priest,</HI> might be an Apology for him. But let us consider the word <HI>Rascal</HI>; according to <HI>Goulaman's</HI> Dictionary, a <HI>Rascal</HI> is a <HI>Brawler,</HI> and <HI>Empty Talker,</HI> and <HI>one that deceiveth is Neighbour by false and weak Arguments,</HI> and <HI>Cole</HI> in his <HI>Latine</HI> &amp; <HI>English Dictionary</HI> saith, the Latine word <HI>Nebulo,</HI> cometh of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Nabal,</HI> and any ordinary School-Boy that hath but learned his Accidence, knoweth that <HI>Nebulo</HI> signifieth, <HI>Rascal, Villian, Knave</HI> or <HI>Rogue,</HI> and in Scripture we find the same word, see <HI>Isa.</HI> 32.6. <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>For the Rascal will speak Villiany</HI>; and <HI>Ier.</HI> 29.23. <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>They commit Villiany</HI>; and as <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ldman</HI> in his Dictionary saith, a <HI>Villian</HI> and a <HI>Rascal</HI> is of the same Signification.

being about to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ute in a Monthly Meeting, and holding forth, <HI>That God was present in all his Creatures,</HI> this Person stood up, and with much Opposition Questioning, as <HI>Paul</HI>'s fool did about the Resur|rection) said, in a rude and boisterous manner, <HI>What</HI> George! <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Spirit of God speak in Trees?</HI> Whereupon G. K. said (being greatly provoked by his Interrupting of him, and Unchri|stian behaviour and Discourse) <HI>Thou Impudent Rascal, who faith the Spirit of God speaks in Trees, as it doth in men?</HI> But to make the thing seem Odious, the Publishers of this Publick-Writing say, <HI>It was in a publick Assembly,</HI> as if it had been in some Court, or as if he had been brought before this Magistrate (as they call him) upon some Exami|nation, and there, instead of behaving himself soberly, he presently calls him <HI>Impudent Rascal</HI>; this they would falsly insinuate, as also, <HI>That before long he'll go into the Council Room, and into the Courts, and there Revile the Councilors and Magistrates, &amp; call them Impudent Rascals.</HI> Oh, the Horrid Impudency of these Men! Let Shame cover their faces, if they have any left in them!</P>
<P>And whereas they further say, <HI>That</HI> G. K. <HI>with several of his Adhe|rents with an unusual Insolency having Traduced the Industry, Care and Vigilency of some Magistrates here, in their la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Proceedings against some Privateers, &amp;c. and hath thereby also defamed and arreigned the determi|nations of the Provincial Iudicatory, &amp;c.</HI> As if G. K. and several others had printed a Book, and defamed and arreigned them, and denyed their Power of Magistracy; whereas all that impartially read the said printed Appeal will find that G. K. did not defame nor arreign them, but they having given a Commission and hired men to fight&punc; (which was diametrically opposite and contrary to the often declared and known Principle of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> against <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l Vse of the Carnal Sword,</HI>) it was proposed, amongst other things, to be consi|dered by all faithful Friends at the Yearly Meeting, whether these men ought not to be condemned &amp; disowned as <HI>Quakers</HI>; but it was never intended to deny them to be Magistrates, for as Magistrates they were obliged to do what they did, and it was Commendable in them who did so Commissionate and hire men to fight, and also sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the Town for Arms, &amp;c. But the great Question is, <HI>Whether they did not Transgress as they professed to be Ministers and Quakers?</HI> If nay, but that the <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Vigilency of these Magistrates here at</HI> Philadelphia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Quakers, <HI>is worthy of Commendation,</HI> as they intimate, <HI>for saving
<PB N="10" REF="000642_0011_0FA962281EC0E8D8">
of a Sloop by Force of Arms,</HI> how much more shall their care and vigi|lency be worthy of Commendation, to raise a Militia to save and de|fend the whole Country, if any occasion should offer? but how steadfast this doth manifest them to be to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principle of <HI>Refusing in all cases to fight, and that for Conscience sake,</HI> I shall leave all to judge. I always thought that which was a matter of Conscience to the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Old-England, Barbadoes,</HI> and other places, had been a matter of Conscience to them under a Government of their own, but I find the contrary in these Magistrates &amp; many others joyned with them here. But that which seems the most strange to several observing Persons in this place, is, that several called <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Maryland, Barbadoes,</HI> and other place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that pretend its a matter of Conscience to them <HI>not to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar Arms,</HI> yet now will own these here in that Practice, unless they now think to leave that Article out of their Creed.</P>
<P>In the next place, whereas <HI>Peter Boss</HI> being offended with the Judg|ment of the 28. writ a Letter to <HI>Samuell Ienings,</HI> (being then in Church Fellowship with him) showing his dislike thereof, and telling <HI>S. I.</HI> of some of the Scandals he lay under, for this they issued forth a War|rant against him, and put him into Prison, without ever dealing with him in a Church method, and at the next Court presented him for the same, to which Court he was bound to answer, where he gave his attendance, with his Witnesses ready, but not brought to Tryal, although much desired by him and his Wife, who urged the Injuries of the delay thereof.</P>
<P>At the same Court <HI>William Bradford</HI> &amp; <HI>Iohn M^c^cComb</HI> appeared, and desired they might come to Tryal, it being greatly to their prejudice to be kept Prisoners, &amp; saying, it is provided by <HI>Magna Charta, That Iustice shall not be delayed to any,</HI> and we being <HI>free-born English Subjects,</HI> claim this as our Priviledge, and hope this Court will not deny it us, because not only o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Persons are restrained, but <HI>William Bradford's</HI> working Tools are detained from him, with which he should work to maintain his Family.</P>

<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> waving from that, the Prisoners still prest for a Tryal.

<P>All this time, <HI>Iohn Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> Sheriff, pleaded vehemently against the Prisoners, greatly aggravating their (pretended) Crimes; and when complained of, that the Sheriff, (through whose hands goes all Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Forfeitures) should be so bitter an Attorney against the Prisoners, he cloaked it under the Visor of a <HI>Prothonitor.</HI></P>
<P>So this Court passed over, &amp; the said Persons not brought to Tryal, but yet not wholly barren of Action, nor void of Injustice; for tho' they had not only got <HI>W.

<P><HI>In the Presence of Almighty God and this Court, you shall promise, well and truly to Try &amp; true D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liverance make betwixt the Honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le</HI> William Penn, <HI>Proprietary and Governour of this Province, and the Prisoner at the Bar, according to Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>After which, <HI>David Lloyd</HI> first, and <HI>Iohn White</HI> next pleaded very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard against him, that that Letter did defame <HI>Sam.

<P>To which the Attorneys of <HI>Peter Boss</HI> pleaded, That he acknowledg|ed the writing that Letter, but what was said therein concerning <HI>S. Iening<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> was not against him as he was a Magistrate, nor could it be reckoned a Defamation, because 'twas only a private Letter sent to himself, showing his dislike in some things, and desiring him to clear himself of other gross &amp; scandalous things that were reported of him, as is usual for one Church Member to do to another; &amp; they brought a Case out of <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s <HI>Faithful Counsellor,</HI> that what is said must be <HI>Falso &amp; Maliciose,</HI> i. e. falsly and maliciously, otherwise not actionable. And that if a man speak slightingly of a Magistrate, if it be when he is not in the exercise of his Office, it is no defaming of him as a Magi|strate, and so no trespass against the Law alledged.</P>
<P>To which <HI>David Lloyd</HI> replyed, <HI>That what was spoke against</HI> Samuell Jenings, <HI>must needs relate to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im as a Magistrate, for take away</HI> Samuell Jenings, <HI>and where will the Magistrate be?</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Sam. Ienings</HI> said, <HI>Take away</HI> Sam. Jenings <HI>the Magistrate, and where will</HI> Sam. Jenings <HI>the Quaker be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> By this it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meth to <HI>S. Ienings</HI> that it is as inherent in him to be a Magistrate as to be a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and therefore when his Magistracy

<P>To which G. K.

<P>This is wrong; for the Jury are Judges in Law, as well as in matter of Fact. Which <HI>D. Lloyd</HI> again denyed. Where|upon some of the Jury desired to know what they were to be attested to try, for they did believe in their Consciences, they were obliged to try and find whether that Paper was seditious, as well as whether <HI>Will.

</SP>
<P>Then <HI>D.

And</HI> Will. Bradford <HI>is presented for printing and publishing this seditious Paper, whereof you of the Iury are to find him guilty, if it appear to you that he has printed it.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>W. Bradford,</SPEAKER>

<P>Then <HI>D. Lloyd</HI> read the Act against Printing, 14 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 33. against Books being printed without the Printers Name to them, and he said, <HI>That was one Act which they prosecuted</HI> W. Bradford <HI>upon.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Penn</HI>'s &amp; the <HI>Quakers</HI> Books were printed without the Printers Name to them, when that Act was in force; and yet we never heard that any Printer in <HI>England</HI> was prosecuted for that; and therefore these here have exceeded them in <HI>England</HI>; which manifests their Malice and revengeful Spirit, that because they cannot fix the matter to be any Breach of the Peace (tho' they pretend it is) they'll prosecute the Printer for not putting his Name to what they suppose he Printed.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That all the time these Persons were upon Tryal, the grand Jury sate by them, over-awing and threatning them when they spoke boldly in their own defence, and one of the Jury had Pen, Ink &amp; Paper to write down such words as they disliked, signifying that they would present them, and Justice <HI>Cook</HI> other times bid them take notice of such and such words, thereby over-awing the Prisoners that they had not liberty to plead freely. And when <HI>Tho.

<P>After a long time of pleading, <HI>D.

<P>Does not this show the great declension of these People from their antient Principle against the use of Carnal Weapons, that for only proposing it to be enquired into, Whether it be not a Transgres|sion of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principle, for any of that People to hire and com|missionate men to fight, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y will cast men into Goal, &amp; prosecute them as Seditions Persons for so doing?</P>
<P>Here follows a breviate of a Paper that was presented to the Court, to show, that it was agreeable to the <HI>Quakers</HI> antient Testimony not to fight, which they took little or no notice of.</P>
