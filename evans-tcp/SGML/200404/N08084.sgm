<P>THIS day his Majesty came to the House of Peers, and being in his royal robes seated on the throne with the usual solemnity, Sir Francis Moli|neux, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, was sent with a Message from his Majesty to the House of Commons, commanding their atten|dance in the House of Peers. The Commons being come thither accordingly, his Majesty was pleased to give his royal assent to</P>
<P>An ACT to REPEAL an Act made in the last Session of Parliament, in|tituled, an Act for granting and applying certain Stamp-Duties and other Duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, towards further defraying the expences of defending, protecting and securing the same, and for amending such parts of the several Acts of Parliament relating to the trade and revenues of the said Colonies and Plantations, as direct the manner of determining and recovering the penalties and forfeitures therein mentioned.</P>
<P>Also ten public bills, and seventeen private ones.</P>
<P>Yesterday there was a meeting of the principal Merchants concerned in the American trade, at the King's Arms tavern in Cornhill, to consider of an Ad|dress to his Majesty on the beneficial Repeal of the late Stamp-Act.</P>
<P>Yesterday morning about eleven o'clock a great number of North American Merchants went in their coaches from the King's Arms tavern in Cornhill to the House of Peers, to pay their duty to his Majesty, and to express their satisfac|tion at his signing the Bill for Repealing the American Stamp-Act, there was upwards of fifty coaches in the procession.</P>
<P>Last night the said gentleman dispatched an express for Falmouth, with fif|teen copies of the Act for repealing the Stamp-Act, to be forwarded immediate|ly for New York.</P>
<P>Orders are given for several merchantmen in the river to proceed to sea im|mediately on their respective voyages to North America, some of whom have been cleared out since the first of November last.</P>
<P>Yesterday messengers were dispatched to Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, and all the great manufacturing towns in England, with an account of the final decision of an august assembly relating to the Stamp-Act.</P>
<P>When the KING went to the House of Peers to give the Royal Assent, there was such a vast Concourse of People, huzzaing, clapping Hands, &amp;c. that it was several Hours before His Majesty reached the House.</P>
<P>Immediately on His Majesty's Signing the Royal Assent to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act the Merchants trading to America, dispatched a Vessel which had been in waiting, to put into the first Port on the Continent with the Account.</P>
<P>There were the greatest Rejoicings possible in the City of London, by all Ranks of People, on the TOTAL Repeal of the Stamp-Act,&mdash;the Ships in the River displayed all their Colours, Illuminations and Bonfires in many Parts.&mdash;In short, the Rejoicings were as great as was ever known on any Occasion.</P>
<P>It is said the Acts of Trade relating to America would be taken under Con|sideration, and all Grievances removed. The Friends to America are very pow|erful, and disposed to assist us to the utmost of their Ability.</P>
<P>Capt. Blake sailed the same Day with Capt. Coffin, and Capt. Shand a Fort|night before him, both bound to this Port.</P>
