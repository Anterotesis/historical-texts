FUNERAL TRIBUTE
To the Honourable Dust of that most Charitable Christian, Vnbiassed Politician,
And unimitable Pyrotechnist
John Winthrope <ABBR>esq</ABBR>:
A Member of the Royal Society, &amp; Governour of Conecticut Colony in
NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Who expired in his Countreys Service, <DATE>April. 6th. 1676.</DATE></HEAD>
<L>ANother Black Parenthesis of woe</L>
<L>The <HI>Printer</HI> wills that all the World should know</L>
<L>Sage Winthrop prest with publick sorrow Dies</L>
<L>As the Sum total of our Miseries:</L>
<L>A Man of worth who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> may ranked be</L>
<L>Not with the thirty but the peerless three</L>
<L><HI>Of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="faint"> Worthies,</HI> Heir to all the Stock</L>
<L>Of praise his S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">re received from his Flock:</L>
<L>GREAT <HI>WINTHROPS</HI> Name shall never be forgotten</L>
<L>Till all <HI>NEW-ENGLANDS</HI> Race be dead and rotten;</L>
<L>That Common Stock of all his Countries weal</L>
<L>Whom Grave and Tomb-stone never can conceal.</L>
<L>Three Colonies his <HI>PATIENTS</HI> bleeding lie</L>
<L>Deserted by their great <HI>PHYSICIANS</HI> eye;</L>
<L>Whose common sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">ce is po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">zed for their tears,</L>
<L>And Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">es fly open to a Sea of fears.</L>
<L>His Christian Modesty would never let</L>
<L>His Name be near unto his <HI>SAVIOVRS</HI> set:</L>
<L>Yet Miracles set by, hee'd act his part</L>
<L>Better to LIFE then Doctors of his Art.</L>
<L>Projections various by fire he made</L>
<L>Where Nature had her common Treasure laid.</L>
<L>Some thought the tincture <HI>Philosophick</HI> lay</L>
<L>Hatcht by the Mineral Sun in <HI>WINTHROPS</HI> way&punc;</L>
<L>And clear it shines to me he had a Stone</L>
<L>Grav'd with his Name which he could read alone.</L>
<L>To say how like a <HI>SCEVOLA</HI> in Court</L>
<L>Or ancient <HI>CONSVLS</HI> Histories report</L>
<L>I here for bear, hoping some learned Tongue</L>
<L>Will quaintly write, and not his Honour wrong.</L>
<L>His common Acts with brightest lustre shone,</L>
<L>But in <HI>Apollo's</HI> Art he was alone.</L>
<L>Sometimes Earths veins creeping from endless holes</L>
<L>Would stop his plodding eyes: anon the Coals</L>
<L>Must search his Treasure, conversant in use</L>
<L>Not of the Mettals only but the juice.</L>
<L>Sometimes his wary steps, but wandring too</L>
<L>Would carry him the Christal Mountains to</L>
<L>Where Nature locks her Gems, each softly spark</L>
<L>Mocking the Stars, spher'd in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="blotted"> dark.</L>
<L>Sometimes the Hough, anon the Gardners Spade</L>
<L>He deign'd to use, and tools of th' Chymick trade.</L>
<L>His fruit of Toyl Hermetically done</L>
<L>Stream to the poor as light doth from the Sun.</L>
<L>The lavish Garb of silks, Rich Plush and Rings</L>
<L>Physicians Livery, at his feet he flings.</L>
<L>One hand the Bellows held, by t'other Coals</L>
<L>Disposes he to hatch the health of Souls;</L>
<L>Which Mysteries this <HI>Chiron</HI> was more wise</L>
<L>Then unto ideots to Anatomize.</L>
<L>But in a second person hopes I have</L>
<L>His Art will live though he possess the Grave.</L>
<L>To treat the <HI>MORALS</HI> of this Healer <HI>Luke</HI></L>
<L>Were to essay to write a <HI>PENTATVKE,</HI></L>
<L>Since all the Law as to the <HI>MORAL</HI> part</L>
<L>Had its impression in his spotless heart:</L>
<L>The vertues shining brightest in his Crown</L>
<L>Were self depression, scorning all renown;</L>
<L>Meekness and Justice were together laid</L>
<L>When any Subject from good order straid.</L>
<L>Neither did ever Artificial fire</L>
<L>Boyle up the Choler of his temper higher</L>
<L>Then modest bounds. In Church and Common-wealth</L>
<L>Who was the Balsome of his Countries Health.</L>
<L><HI>Europe</HI> sure knew his worth who fixt his Name</L>
<L>Among its glorious Stars of present fame.</L>
<L>Here Royal <HI>CHARLES</HI> leads up, stands <HI>WINTHROPE</HI> there</L>
<L>Amongst the <HI>Virtuosi</HI> in the Rear:</L>
<L>But for his Art with hundreds of the rest</L>
<L>He might be be plac'd in Front and come a Breast.</L>
<L>What Soul in fouldings 'tother side the Serene</L>
<L>With Souls turn'd Angels guess we to have been</L>
<L>When first his Chariot wheels the threshold felt</L>
<L>Where <HI>WINTHROPS, DVDLYS, COTTONS</HI> Spirits dwelt?</L>
<L>VVhat melting joys are there? Sorrows below,</L>
<L>Should adequately from <HI>New-England</HI> flow:</L>
<L>If Saints be intercess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">rs, heres our hope</L>
<L>VVe need not be beholding to the Pope.</L>
<L>VVe have as good our selves, an honest Brother</L>
<L>Outvies their Saintship, there or any other.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Helmo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">ts</HI> lines so learned and abstruse</L>
<L>Are laid aside and quite cast out of use:</L>
<L>And Authors which such vast expenses spent</L>
<L>Lye like his Corps; his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">ar is only lent</L>
<L>To Heavenly Harmonies, all things his Eye</L>
<L>Views in the platforme whence all forms did fly;</L>
<L>His labours cease for ever, but the fruit</L>
<L>He reaps at Fountain head without dispute.</L>
