And,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That there may be the less temptation to others to continue in the said, now dangerous commerce, we do in like manner solemnly covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> not buy, purchase or consume or suffer any person by, for or under us to purchase or consume, in any manner whatever, any goods, wares or merchandize which shall arrive in America from Great Britain aforesaid, from and after the last day of August next ensuing. And in order as much as in us lies to prevent our being interrupted and defeated in this only peaceable measure, entered into for the recovery and preser|vation of our rights, we agree to break off all trade, commerce and dealings whatever with all persons, who perfering their own private interest to the salvation of their now perishing country, shall still continue to import goods from Great Britain, or shall purchase of those who do import.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That such persons may not have it in their power to impose upon us by any pretence whatever, we further agree to purchase no article of merchandize from them, or any of them, who shall not have signed this, or a similar covenant, or will not produce an oath, certified by a magistrate to be by them taken to the following purpose&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> I <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> in the county of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="paper folded" EXTENT="1 span"> and propose for sale, have not, to the best of my knowledge, been im|ported from Great Britain, into any port of America since the last day of August, one thousand seven hundred and seventy four, and that I will not, contrary to the spirit of an agreement entering into through this province import or purchase of any person so importing any goods as aforesaid, until the port or harbour of Boston, shall be opened, and we are fully restored to the free use of our constitutional and charter rights. And,</P>
<P>Lastly, we agree, that after this, or a similar covenant has been offered to any person and they refuse to sign it, or produce the oath, abovesaid, we will consider them as contumacious importers, and withdraw all com|mercial connexions with them, so far as not to purchase of them, any article whatever, and publish their names to the world.</P>
