<HEAD>A Narrative &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the <HI>Great-Meadow-Fort</HI> fourteen Miles above <HI>Fort-Dummer, October</HI> 11th 1745, where I was an Inhabitant, I went out from the Fort about 50 Rods to cut Wood; and when I had done, I walk'd towards the Fort, but in my Way heard the crackling of Fences behind me, and turning about, saw 12 or 13 Indians, with red painted Heads, running after me: On which I cry'd to God for Help, and ran, and hollow'd as I ran, to alarm the Fort; but by that I had ran ten Rods, theIndians came up with me &amp; took hold of me: At the same Time the Men at the Fort shot at the Indians, &amp; kill'd one on the Spot, wounded another, who died 14 Days after he got Home, and likewise shot a Bullet thro' the Powder-Horn of one that had hold of me. They then led me into theSwamp &amp;pinion'd me. I then committed myCase toGod, and pray'd, that since it was his Will to deliver me into the Hands of these cruel Men, I might find Favour in their Eyes: Which Request, God of his infiniteMercy was pleased to grant; for they were generally kind to me while I was with 'em: Some of the Indians,
<PB N="4" REF="006162_0003_0000000000000000">
at that Time, took the Charge of me, othes ran into the Field to kill Cattle. They led me about half a Mile; where we stay'd in open Sight of the Fort, 'till the Indians who were killing Cattle came to us laden with Beef: Then they went a little further to a House, where they stay'd to cut the Meat from the Bones, and cut the Helve off my Ax, and stuck it into the Ground, pointing the Way we went.</P>
<P>Then we travel'd along by the RiverSide&punc; and when we had got about threeMiles, I espied aCanoe coming down on the further Side the River, with <HI>David Rugg</HI> &amp; <HI>Robert Baker,</HI> belonging to our Fort. I made as muchNoise as I could, by Hamming&amp;c. that they might see us before theIndians saw them, and so get ashore, &amp; happily escape; but the Indians saw them, &amp; shot a-cross the River 20 or 30 Guns at them, and kill'd the first mentioned Person, viz. <HI>David Rugg,</HI> but <HI>Robert Baker,</HI> the other Person got ashore, &amp; escaped. Then some of the Indians swam over the River, &amp; bro't the Canoe over the River, scalp'd &amp; stript the deadMan, and then went about a Mile further, when we came to another House, where we stop'd; while there, we heard Men running by theBank of the River, whom I knew to be <HI>IonathanThayer, Samuel Nutting,</HI> and my Son <HI>Caleb How:</HI> Five of the Indians ran to head them. My Heart ak'd for them, and pray'd to God to save them from the Hands of the Enemy. I suppose they hid under the Bank of the River; for the Indians were gone some Time, but came back without them, blessed be God.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006162_0004_0000000000000000">We went about a Mile further, where we lodg'd that Night, &amp; roasted the Meat they had got: The next Day we travel'd very slow, by Reason of he Indian who was wounded, which was a great Favour to me. We lodg'd the second Night againstNumb. <HI>Four</HI>; the third Day we also travel'd slowly, &amp;stop'd often to rest, &amp; to get along the wounded Man; we lodg'd that Night by the second small River that runs into the great River against Numb. <HI>Four.</HI></P>
<P>The 4th Day Morning, the Indians held a Piece of Bark, and bid me write my Name, &amp; how many Days we had travel'd; for, said they, <HI>May be English Men will come here.</HI> That was a hard Day to me; for it was a wet Day, &amp; we went over prodigious Mountains, so that I became weak&amp;faint; for I had not eaten the value of one Meal from the Time I was taken, having nothing to eat but Beef almost raw, without Bread or Salt. When I came first to the Foot of those Hills, I tho't it was impossible for me to ascend them, without immediate Help from God; therefore my constant Recourse was to him for Strength; which he was graciously pleased to grant me: and for which I desire to Praise him. We got that Day a little before Night to a Place where they had a hunting House, a Kettle, some Beer, Indian Corn, and Salt: They boil'd a good Mess of it; I drank of the Broth, eat of the Meat and Corn, and was wonderfully refreshed, so that I felt like another Man.</P>
<P>The next Morning we got up early, and after we had eaten, my Master said to me, <HI>You must quick walk to Day, or I will kill you.</HI> I told him I would go as
<PB N="6" REF="006162_0005_0000000000000000">
fast as I could, &amp; no faster, if he did kill me: At which, anoldIndian who was the best Friend I had, tookCare of me. We travel'd thatDay very hard, &amp; over steepHills, but it being a cool windy Day, I perform'd it withmore Ease than before; yet was much tir'd before Night, but dare not complain.</P>
<P>The nextDay theIndians gave me a Pair of their Shoes, so that I travel'd with abundant more Ease than when I wore my own Shoes; tho' I eat but very little, our Victuals being almost spent; when the Sun was about two Hours high, the Indians scattered to hunt, and they soon kill'd a Fawn, 'and three small Bears; so that we had again Meat eno', some of which we boil'd, &amp; eat heartily of, by which I felt strong&punc;</P>
<P>The next Day we travel'd very hard, and per|form'd it with Ease; insomuch that one of the Indians told me, I was a very strongMan: About three of the Clock we came to the Lake, where they had five Canoes, and Pork, IndianCorn, and Tobacco. We got into theCanoes, when the In|dians stuck up a Pole about eight Feet long with theScalp of <HI>David Rugg</HI> on the Top of it, painted red, with the Likeness of Eyes &amp; Mouth on it: We sail'd about tenMiles, &amp; then went onShore; and after we had made a Fire, we boil'd a good Supper, and eat heartily.</P>
<P>The next Day we set sail for <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> but when we were within a Mile of the Place, they went on Shore, where were eight or ten French and Indians, but before I got on Shore two of them came running into the Water Knee deep, &amp; pull'd
<PB N="7" REF="006162_0006_0000000000000000">
me out of theCanoe; there they sang and danced round me, after which, one of them bid me set down, which I did; and then they pull'd off my Shoes &amp; Buckles, and took them with me. Soon after we went along to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> &amp; when we had got there, the People both French and Indians were very thick by the Water-Side; two of the In|dians took me out of the Canoe, and leading me, bid me run, which we did; it was about 20 Rods from the Fort; the Fort is large, built withStone &amp; Lime; they led me up to the third Loft, where was theCaptain'sChamber; aChair was bro't that I might set by the Fire &amp; warm me. Soon after the Indians that I belong'd to, &amp; others that were there, came intotheChamber, among whom was one I knew, named <HI>Pealtomy</HI>; he came &amp; spake to me, and shookHands with me; and I was glad to see him: He went out, but soon return'd, and bro't to me another Indian named <HI>Amrusus,</HI> Husband to Mrs. <HI>Eunice Williams,</HI> Daughter of the late Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Deerfield:</HI> He was glad to see me, and I to see him. He asked me after his Wife's Relations, and shew'd a great deal of Respect to me. A while after this, the Indians sat in a Ring in the Chamber, and <HI>Pealtomy</HI> came to me, and told me, I must go sing and dance before the In|dians; I told him, I could not: He told me over some Indian Words, and bid me sing <HI>them:</HI> I told him, I could not. With that, the rest of the Fort who could speak some English came to me, &amp; bid me sing it in English, which was, <HI>I don't know where I go</HI>; which I did, dancing round that Ring
<PB N="8" REF="006162_0007_0000000000000000">
three Times; &amp; then I sat down by the Fire: The Priest came to me, &amp; gave me a Dram of Rum; after that the Captain bro't me Part of a Loaf of Bread and a Plate of Butter, and ask'd me to eat, which I did heartily; for I had not eaten any Bread from the Time I was taken 'till then. The French Priest &amp; all the Officers shew'd me a great deal of Respect: The Captain gave me a Pair of goodBuckskin Shoes, the Priest fix'd them on my Feet; and we stay'd there that Night; where I slept with the Priest, Captain and Lieut: The Lieutenant'sName was <HI>Ballock,</HI> he had been a Pri|soner at <HI>Boston,</HI> and had been at <HI>Northampton</HI> and the Towns thereabouts. This Day, which was the Sabbath, I was well treated by the FrenchOfficers with Victuals&amp;Drink: We tarried there 'tillNoon, then went off about a Mile, and put on Shore; where they stay'd the rest of the Day, and having Rum with them, most of 'em were much Liquor'd. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">altomy</HI> and his Squaw, &amp; another Indian Family went with us, and by them I found out that <HI>Wm. Phipps</HI> kill'd an Indian, besides that we wounded before he was kill'd, for an Indian who was with us, ask'd me, if there was one kill'd near our Fort last Summer? I told him I did not know: He said he had a Brother went out then, and had not seen him since, and that he heard he was kill'd at our Fort, and wanted to know if it was true: But I did not think it best to tell him any such Thing was suspected.</P>
<P>But the Indians now got into a Frolick, and quarrel'd about me; they made me set in the
<PB N="9" REF="006162_0008_0000000000000000">
Canoe by the Water-side: I was afraid they would hurt if not kill me: They attempted to come to me, but the sober Indians hinder'd them that were in Liquor. <HI>Pealtomy</HI> seeing the Rout went to the Fort, and soon after Lieut. <HI>Ballock,</HI> with some Sol|diers, came to us, and when the Indians were made easy, they went away: We lodg'd there that Night, and the next Day was a stormy Day of Wind Snow and Rain; so that we were forc'd to tarry there that Day and the next Night; in this Time the Indians continued fetching Rum from the Fort, and kept half drunk: Here I underwent some Hardship by staying there so long in a Storm without Shelter or Blanket. They had a great Dance that Night, and hung up <HI>David Rugg's</HI> Scalp on a Pole, dancing round it: After they had done, they lay down to sleep.</P>
<P>The next Morning, which was the tenth Day from the Time of my being taken, we went off in the Canoe, and the Night after we arriv'd at the wide <HI>Lake,</HI> and there we stay'd that Night; some of the Indians went a hunting, and kill'd a fat Buck-Deer, so that we had Victuals plenty, for we had a full Supply of Bread given us at the Fort at <HI>Crown-Point.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, the Wind being calm, we set out about two Hours before Day; soon after came to aSchooner lying at Anchor, went on Board, the French treated us very civilly: They gave each of us a Dram of Rum, and Victuals to eat. As soon as it was Day we left the Schooner, and two Hours before Sun-set got over the Lake, and
<PB N="10" REF="006162_0009_0000000000000000">
next Day came to <HI>Shamballee,</HI> where we met 300 French and 200 Indians, who did the Mischief at and about Mr. <HI>Lydius's</HI> Fort. I was taken out of the Canoe by two Frenchmen, and sled to a House about ten Rods off as fast as I could run, the Indians flinging Snow-Balls at me. As soon as I got to the House, the Indians stood round me very thick, and bid me sing and dance; which I did with them, in their Way; then they gave a Shout, and left off. Two of them came to me, one of whom smote me on Cheek, to'other on the other, which made the Blood run plenti|fully. Then they bid me sing and dance again, which I did with them, and they with me, shout|ing as before. Then two Frenchmen took me under each Arm, and run so fast that the Indians could not keep up with us to hurt me: We ran about 40 Rods to another House; where a Chair was bro't for me to set down: The House was soon full of French and Indians, and round the House they were looking in at the Windows. A French Gentleman came to me, took me by the Hand, and led me into a small Room, where none came in but such as he admitted: He gave me Victu|als and Drink: Several French Gentlemen and In|dians came in, and were civil to me. The Indians who came in, could speak English; they shook Hands with me, call'd me Brother. They told me they were all Soldiers, and were going to <HI>New-England:</HI> They said, they should go to my Town; which was a great Damp to my Spirit, 'till I heard of their Return, where they had been, and what they
<PB N="11" REF="006162_0010_0000000000000000">
had done. A while after this, the Indians whom I belong'd to, came to me, and told me we must go; which we did; &amp; after going down the River about twoMiles, we came to the thickest of the Town, where was a large Fort built with Stone and Lime, and very large and fine Houses in it; where was the General of the Army I spake of before: He asked me, what News from <HI>London</HI> &amp; <HI>Boston</HI>; I told him such as I tho't convenient, and omitted the rest; and then went down to the Canoes, when some of the Indians went &amp; got a plenty of Bread &amp; Beef, which they put into the Canoes, &amp; then we went into a French House, where we had a good Supper: There came in several French Gentlemen to see me, who were civil to me; one of them gave me a <HI>Crown</HI> Sterl. We lod'd there 'till about two Hours before Day, when we arose, and went down the River: I sup|pose we went a Hundred Miles that Day, which brought us into the great River call'd <HI>Quebec-River</HI>; we lodg'd that Night in a French House, and were civilly treated.</P>
<P>The next Day we went down the River, and I was carried before the Governor there, which was the Sabbath, &amp; the 16th Day after my being taken. We stay'd there about three Hours, and were well treated by the French; and then the Indians were order'd to carry me down to <HI>Quebec</HI>; which was 90 Miles further: We went down the River about three Miles that Night; then went ashore, and lodg'd the remaind<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Night.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006162_0011_0000000000000000">The next Morning we set off, and the second Day which was the 18th from the Time I was ta|ken, we arriv'd at <HI>Quebec.</HI> The Land is inhabited on both Sides the River from the Lake to <HI>Quebec,</HI> which is at least two Hundred Miles, but especially from <HI>Shambelle</HI> very thick, so that the Houses are within Sight of one another all the Way.</P>
<P>But to return; after we arrived at <HI>Quebec,</HI> I was carried up into a large Chamber which was full of Indians, who were civil to me: Many of the French came in to see me, and were very kind to me: I stay'd there about two Hours, when a French Gen|tlemen who could speak good English came in and told me, I must go with him to the Governour; which I did; and after answering to a great many Questions, and treated with as much Bread &amp; Wine as I desir'd, I was sent with an Officer to theGuard House, and led into a small Room, where was an English man named <HI>William Stroud,</HI> a Kinsman of the Hon. Judge <HI>Lynde's</HI> in <HI>New-England:</HI> He be|long'd to <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and had been at <HI>Quebec</HI> six Years, whom the Governour kept confin'd for fear he should leave them and go to <HI>New-England,</HI> and discover their Strength: Mr. <HI>Stroud</HI> and I were kept in the Guard-House one Week, with a Suffi|ciency of Food &amp; Drink: The French Gentlemen kept coming in to see me, &amp; was very civilly treat|ed by them: I had the better Opportunity of dis|coursing with them, as Mr. <HI>Stroud</HI> was a good Inter|preter.</P>
<P>After this we were sent to Prison, where I found one <HI>Iames Kinlade,</HI> who was taken 14 Days before
<PB N="13" REF="006162_0012_0000000000000000">
I was at <HI>Sheepscot</HI> at the Eastward in <HI>New England:</HI> I was much pleased with hisConversation, esteeming him a Man of true Piety: We were kept in Prison eight Days, with Liberty to keep in the Room with the Prison-keeper. We were daily visited by Gen|tlemen and Ladies, who shew'd us great Kindness, in giving us Money &amp; other Things, and a pleasant Behaviour towards us; blessed be God therefor, for I desire to ascribe all the Favours I have been the Partaker of ever since my Captivity, to the abundant Grace and Goodness of a bountiful God, as the first Cause.</P>
<P>After this, Mr. <HI>Kinlade</HI> and I were sent to ano|ther Prison, where were 22 Seamen belonging to several Parts of our King'sDominions, three of 'em Captains of Vessels, viz. <HI>Iames Southerland</HI> of <HI>Cape-Cod, William Chipman</HI> of <HI>Marblehead, William Pote</HI> of <HI>Casco-Bay</HI>; this Prison was a large House built with Stone and Lime two Feet thick, and about 120 Feet long. We had two large Stoves in it, and Wood enough, so that we could keep our selves warm in the coldest Weather. We had Provision sufficient, viz two Pound of good Wheat Bread, one Pound of Beef, and Peas answerable, to each Man ready dress'd every Day.</P>
<P>When I had been there a few Days theCaptives desir'd me to lead them in carrying on Morning and Evening Devotions, which I was willing to do: We had a Bible, a Psalm-Book, and some other good Books; our constant Practice was to read a Chap|ter in the Bible, and sing Part of a Psalm, and to pray Night and Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="006162_0013_0000000000000000">When I was at the first Prison I was stript of all my old and lousey Cloaths, &amp; had other Cloath|ing given me from Head to Foot, and had many Kindnesses shewn me by those that liv'd there|abouts, more especially by one Mr. <HI>Corby</HI> and his Wife, who gave me Money there, and bro't me many good Things at the other Prison. But here I was taken ill, as was also most of the other Pri|soners, with a Flux, which lasted near a Month, so that I was grown very weak, but after that I was healthful, thro' divine Goodness, blessed be God for it: I was much concern'd for my Country, especially for the Place I was taken from, by Reason that I met an Army going thither, as they told me: The 27th Day of <HI>November</HI> we had News come to the Prison that they were come back to <HI>Shamballe,</HI> and had taken upwards of a Hundred Captives, which increas'd my Concern, for I ex|pected our Fort, and others thereabouts, were de|stroyed, which put me upon earnest Prayer to God, that he would give me Grace to submit to his Will; after which I was easy in my Mind.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight after, a Dutchman was bro't to Prison, who was one of the Captives the said Ar|my had taken; he told me they had burnt Mr. <HI>Ly|dius</HI>'s Fort, and all the Houses at that new Town|ship, and had kill'd Capt. <HI>Schyler</HI> and five or six more, and had brought 50 Whites and about 60 Negroes to <HI>Montreal:</HI> I was sorry to hear of so much Mischief done, but rejoyc'd they had not been upon our River and the Towns thereabouts; for which I gave Thanks to God for his greatGoodness
<PB N="15" REF="006162_0014_0000000000000000">
in preserving them, and particularly my Family.</P>
<P>When Christmas came, the Governour sent us 24 Livres; the Lord Intendant came into the Prison and gave us 24 Livres more, which was about two Guineas: He told us he hop'd we should be sent Home in a little Time; he was a pleasant Gentle|man, and very kind to the Captives: Some time after Mr. <HI>Shearly</HI> a Gentleman of Quality came to us, and gave to the three Sea Captains 24 Livres, and to me twelve, and the next Day sent me a Bottle of Cla|ret Wine. About ten Days after he sent me twelve Livres more; it was in all <HI>eight Pounds</HI> old Tenor.</P>
<P><HI>Ianuary</HI> 20th 1745, 6. Eighteen Captives were brought from <HI>Mountreal</HI> to the Prison at <HI>Quebec,</HI> which is 180 Miles.</P>

Seven Captives more who were taken at <HI>Albany</HI> were brought to the Prison to us, <HI>viz</HI> six Men and one old Woman 70 Years old, who had been so infirm for seven Years past, she had not been able to walk the Streets, yet perform'd this tedious Journey with Ease.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 15. One of the Captives taken at <HI>Albany</HI> after 14 or 15 Days Sickness died in the Hospital at <HI>Quebec,</HI> a Man of a sober pious Conversation, his Name was <HI>Lawrence Plaffer,</HI> a German born.</P>

<P><HI>MAY</HI> 25. 1747. This Day died Mr. <HI>Nehemiah How,</HI> in the Hospital at <HI>Quebec</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> in the 55th Year of his Age; who had been aCap|tive there one Year, seven Months, and fifteen Days: He enjoy'd his Health 'till about the mid|dle of this Month: He was a loving Husband, and a tender Father; greatly belov'd by hisBrethren and Sisters, and indeed by every One who was acquainted with him: Mr. <HI>How</HI> was a Person who had behav'd himself as a Christian from his Youth. His Death is a great Loss to his Friends; but I believe aGain to himself; and that he is gone from a Captivity of Sorrow on Earth, to join in Songs of everlasting Joy among the Ransom'd of the LORD in the heavenly <HI>Zion.</HI></P>
