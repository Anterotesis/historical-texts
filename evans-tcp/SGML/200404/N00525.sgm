<HEAD>RULES
For the Society of
NEGROES. 1693.</HEAD>
<P>WE the Miserable Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> and of <HI>Noah,</HI> thank|fully
Admiring and Accepting the Free-Grace of GOD,
that Offers to Save us from our Miseries, by the Lord Jesus
Christ, freely Resolve, with His Help, to become the
Servants of that Glorious LORD.</P>
<P>And that we may be Assisted in the Service of our <HI>Heavenly Master,</HI>
we now Join together in a SOCIETY, wherein the following RULES
are to be observed.</P>
<LIST><ITEM>I. It shall be our Endeavour, to Meet in the <HI>Evening</HI> after the <HI>Sabbath;</HI>
and <HI>Pray</HI> together by Turns, one to Begin, and another to Conclude
the Meeting; And between the two <HI>Prayers,</HI> a <HI>Psalm</HI> shall be Sung,
and a <HI>Sermon</HI> Repeated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Our coming to the Meeting, shall never be without the <HI>Leave</HI> of
such as have Power over us: And we will be Careful, that our
Meeting may Begin and Conclude between the Hours of <HI>Seven</HI> and
<HI>Nine;</HI> and that we may not be <HI>unseasonably Absent</HI> from the Families
whereto we pertain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. As we will, with the Help of God, at all Times avoid all <HI>Wicked
Company,</HI> so we will Receive none into our Meeting, but such as
have sensibly <HI>Reformed</HI> their Lives from all manner of Wickedness.
And therefore, None shall be Admitted, without the Knowledge and
Consent of the <HI>Minister</HI> of God in this Place; unto whom we will
also carry every Person, that seeks for <HI>Admission</HI> among us; to be by
Him Examined, Instructed and Exhorted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. We will, as often as may be&punc; Obtain some Wise and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" REASON="blotted"> of
the <HI>English</HI> in the Neighbourhood, and especially the Offcers of the
Church, to look in upon us, and by their Presence and Counsil, do
what they think fitting for us&punc;</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. If any of our Number, fall into the Sin of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> or <HI>Swearing,</HI>
or <HI>Cursing,</HI> or <HI>Lying,</HI> or <HI>Stealing,</HI> or notorious <HI>Disobedience</HI> or <HI>Unfaithful|ness</HI>
unto their Masters, we will <HI>Admonish</HI> him of his Miscarriage, and
Forbid his coming to the Meeting, for at least <HI>one Fortnight;</HI> And ex|cept
he then come with great Signs and Hopes of his <HI>Repentance,</HI> we
will utterly Exclude him, with Blotting his <HI>Name</HI> out of our List.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. If any of our Society De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" REASON="faint">le himself with <HI>Fornication,</HI> we will give
him our <HI>Admonition;</HI> and so, debar him from the Meeting, at least <HI>half
a Year:</HI> Nor shall he Return to it, ever any more, without Exemplary
Testimonies of his becoming a <HI>New Creature.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. We will, as we have Opportunity, set our selves to do all the Good
we can, to the other <HI>Negro-Servants</HI> in the Town; And if any of them
should, at unfit Hours, be <HI>Abroad,</HI> much more, if any of them should
<HI>Run away</HI> from their Masters, we will afford them <HI>no Shelter:</HI> But we
will do what in us lies, that they may be discovered, and punished.
And if any <HI>of us,</HI> are found Faulty, in his Matter, they shall be no
longer <HI>of us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. None of our Society shall be <HI>Absent</HI> from our Meeting, without
giving a <HI>Reason</HI> of the Absence; And if it be found, that any have pre|tended
unto their <HI>Owners,</HI> that they came unto the <HI>Meeting,</HI> when they
were otherwise and elsewhere Employ'd, we will faithfully <HI>Inform</HI>
their Owners, and also do what we can to Reclaim such Person from
all such Evil Courses for the Future.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. It shall be expected from every one in the Society, that he learn the
<HI>Catechism;</HI> And therefore, it shall be one of our usual Exercises, for
one of us, to ask the <HI>Questions,</HI> and for all the rest in their Order, to
say the <HI>Answers</HI> in the <HI>Catechism;</HI> Either, The <HI>New-English</HI> Catechism,
or the <HI>Assemblies</HI> Catechism, or the Catechism in the <HI>Negro Christianized.</HI></ITEM></LIST></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></EEBO>
