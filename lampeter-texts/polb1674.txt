<SALUTE><RO>Dear Sir</RO>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic;N Obedience to your Command, I have committed to Pap&rehy;er some Notions I had conceived of the <RO>Bankers</RO> busi&rehy;ness, and the calamitous dependants thereon. I remem&rehy;ber you thought me (though concern'd enough) pretty warm in this Argument last time I discourst it with you; and truly if hard usages will make a wise man mad, the Effect it hath upon a Fool (as I am) may well want a name. I have <RO>I</RO> praise God weather'd out all those dreadful storms which fell some years since upon the Loyal party (as you know) though with the Ship&rehy;wrack of my person and Estate, and this (if <RO>I</RO> may speak it without Osten&rehy;tation) I did with constancy and joy, for though I could see then nothing but Tempests and Hurricanes without me, yet my mind was alwayes refresht with sereneties and calmness, triumphing that <RO>I</RO> was thought worthy at any rate, to suffer for so glorious a cause. After his Majesties Happy Restau&rehy;ration, though neglected and despised, as many of far greater merit than my self likewise were, we did all however possess our souls with patience (though wise men tell us that it was never accounted the best policy to dismiss well deservers in point of Recopence with the satisfaction only of their Con&rehy;sciences, and the rewards of the next would). And now when we and our miserable Families had thought to have protracted (at least) a contempti&rehy;ble life with those poor remainders, and broken pieces of our Fortunes, be&rehy;hold in one moment those also are ravisht from some of us by our friends. By what name shall <RO>I</RO> express this treatment? Shall I call it a violation of the Widdowes Mite? or a breaking in on the Alms basket? no these reach it not, all nature cannot furnish me with a similitude. <NOTE

</P><P>The Poets have a witty Fable of <RO>Tiresias</RO>, the great Southsayer, that he foretold future events by the flying of birds, not that he did see the birds (for he was blind) but (say they) he had alwaies his Daughter <RO>Manto</RO> near at hand, who inform'd him of the manner of their flights, and according to her advertisements, the Father evermore divined: The Mythology or Moral of this Fable is oftentimes applicable to the best and most virtuous Princes, they hear with other mens Ears, they see sometimes thorough the <CORR
SIC="spestacles">spectacles</CORR> of other mens eyes, and according to the colour of the glass, so is the object re&rehy;presented to them; black or red, or perhaps white, whereas the true tincture of the thing may be clearly otherwise; and yet all this while the fault is not in the eye, but in the deceptive glass. If a false Light-house be erected near a dangerous Rock in the Sea, and in a dark and tempestuous night the Ship is steered that way, as to a safe Port, and thereupon suffereth wrack, no body can with any reason impute this misfortune to the error or incogitan&rehy;cy of the <RO>Pilot</RO>, or governour of the Vessel, but rather to the malice and fal&rehy;sity of this wicked invention. Upon this ground it is that <RO>Seneca</RO> (a wise man, Tutor to an Emperor, and one that well understood what he wrote) breaks forth into that passionate interrogation, <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Quid omnia possidentibus deest? ille qui verum dicat</FOREIGN>. What thing only do they want which possess all things? Even (answers he) a person that will give them honest Advertise&rehy;ments. <NOTE

<PB N="[3]"><P>This grievance of ours hath been represented to his Majesty under the pretence and umbrages of Royal Prerogative (which in truth he is ob&rehy;liged to maintain) and of publique Emolument and advantage (which cer&rehy;tainly are the most glorious Objects of Royal prudence). With these and the like Blandishments Sir this Chrystal Fountain of Justice hath been poyson'd and contaminated. This is the Coloquintida with which so inspeakable a sweetness hath been imbittered, these are the Paintings with which so de&rehy;formed an Advice hath been sophisticated. But let me tell you Sir, if in the sequel of this discourse I shall not clearly wipe off all these Varnishes and false colours, and effectively prove this advice to be as mischievous to his Sacred Majesty as his people, I shall think I have very meanly acquitted my self in this business.
</P><P>I hope I shall not be thought to reflect herein, upon any person whatsoever, any farther then his own Conscience may scourge him in this particular. And I know there be many great and illustrious Hero's near his Majesty, (to whose service I could willingly sacrifice an hundred lives had I them) that do abominate so pernicious a Councel.

<P>And I praise God and the King, we live not now in an Age wherein it is more hazardous to discover, an evil action, than to commit it, or wherein the justly accused shall take Revenge of the just Accuser.</P>
<P>Neither would I be understood here to erect my self into an Advocate for the Trade and mistery of <RO>Banking</RO>, A God's name where the Usuries of those people are by the King found outragious and illegal, let them be regu&rehy;lated and reduced to just moderations. All that I contend for is, that the Bankers (whose concernments are now apparently become ours) may by O&rehy;pening the Exchequer be enabled to satisfy their just debts to their Credi&rehy;tors, that so the good and bad, the nocent and innocent may not thus be over&rehy;whelmed together in one and the same common Ruine.</P>

<HEAD>THE Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HE Kings Debt to the <IT>Bankers</IT>, with the miserable consequences thereof, hath now (for little less then three years together) exercised the world with matter, not only of discourse, but astonishment. For indeed who will not be startled to see the common Faith of a Nation violated, and a forcible breach made upon all that may be cal'd Religious and binding, and this also in great measure, to the Ruine of Orphans and Widows, and several, even of those who with unwearied constancy resisted unto blood, and loss of whatsoever was dear unto them in defence of the Crown of <IT>En&rehy;gland</IT>. I shall not here lanch out into the story of particular cases, that Theme will be infinite, and of force to endue stones with speech, and (by a contrariety of Miracle) to overwhelme the most eloquent with silence.
</P><P>I doubt not but I have already Arrested my Reader with frequent a&rehy;musements, and he is by this time impatient to know what may be the rea&rehy;son of all these words? and wherefore a private passenger in the Ship of the Common-wealth, should in this manner concern himself in the sayling thereof?</P>
<P>I answer, First that every Subject is obliged to vindicate, and propugne the Honour and Innocency of his Soveraign; and to cast the Envies and Malignancy of Pestilent Councels, upon the Donors and contrivers there&rehy;of, and perhaps this duty could never be more seasonably exerted then in this present Case. For I should be sorry that this Advisor (as a person of great Honour and worth, said not long since, of one of them openly) should like a Rabbit start out of his Borough, and look about him, and then run in <PB
N="[6]">again, and hide himself, and think no body observ'd him. Certainly he is no good Minister or Servant that will throw the odium of his own evil actions upon his Lord and Master.</P>
<P>I answer, Secondly that all men are interressed in the safety of the Ves&rehy;sel they are imbarqut in, though all ought not to preside at the Helme: And pernicious Advices (like the falcities of the Turkish Alchoran) oftentimes gain strength by the prohibitions of disputing them. I know I shall be thought to broach a Paradox, if I should affirm that some moderate freedomes of this nature, have been sometimes Characters and marks of the happiest and most peaceable Ages of the world; and yet if this assertion be not in some measure true, we must abandon faith to all History: For (as the Lord <IT>Bacon</IT> well notes) such Liberties give vent and discharge often&rehy;times to popular discontentments, and besides the Prince is hereby instru&rehy;cted in what part the Subject is pincht and griev'd, when perhaps he shall attain this information no other way. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Essay of Sediti&rehy;on and Troubles</IT></NOTE> And therefore <IT>Augustus C&aelig;sar</IT> (one of the happiest and greatest Prince it may be that the Sun ever saw <NOTE
REND="it" TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Eutropius lib. 8.</NOTE>) when he was told at any time, that even his own person, and his Edicts were too boldy dis&rehy;courst of in <IT>Rome</IT>, would say, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Quod in Civitate libera, linguas quoque civium liberas esse oportere</FOREIGN>. That in a free City, the Citizens discourse ought also to be free. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Boterus <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de politia</FOREIGN></IT>. lib. 7. c. 8.</NOTE> And this candid profession of his, might pos&rehy;sibly be no mean ingredient in the composition of his own felicities. <IT>Thua&rehy;nus</IT> writing to the great <IT>Henry</IT> the <IT>4th.</IT> of <IT>France</IT>, unto other Laudatives of that Princes Reign, adds this, as none of the meanest. <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ea est Domine rara tuorum temporum f&aelig;lieitas</Q> (saith he) <Q
REND="it" LANG="lat">in quibus unicuiq; sentire qu&aelig; velit, & qu&aelig; sentiat eloqui licet</Q>. Such (Great Sir) is the rare happiness of your times, that in them every man may think what he pleaseth, and speak what he thinketh<ADD>.</ADD> <NOTE
LANG="lat" REND="it" TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Thuani Epistola ante Historiam suam ad Hen. 4. Franci&aelig;.</NOTE> And of the same complexion was that serene Age, in which the excellent Emperour <IT>Trajan</IT> Reign'd, as <IT>Cornelius Tacitus</IT> (who was then living) affirms, from whom the said <IT>Thuanus</IT> seems to have borrowed the very individual words before recited. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Taciti Hist. lib. 5. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in proemio</FOREIGN></IT>.</NOTE> I write not this in countenance of clamour, and scurrilities against those things which I have alwayes reve&rehy;renced and held sacred; but under favour, in our present case, where all nature is big, and in travail to be delivered of speech, I hope her voice shall not be stifled and supprest.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I shall redargue this Objector, with that principle (which the Advisers of this calamity have thought so puissant) <IT>I</IT> mean exigences, and invincible necessity, a necessity of no ordinary nature neither, but of near allyance to that thing which we proverbially say breaks through stone walls, that in hard winterly weather infuseth boldness even into Brutes, that also where nature languisheth, and the means wherewith she should be supported are unjustly substracted from her. The old Comicke saith <PB
N="[7]">well <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="GKGK">TT&apos;argyrion estin haima kai psych&emacr; Brotois</FOREIGN> <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">pecunia Anima, & sanguis est morta&rehy;libus</FOREIGN>. Money is the life and blood of mankind. To deprive a man wrongfully then of that little money which he possesseth, what is it but to deprive him of his blood, yea of his life? I know the great and opulent men of the world cannot descend so low as to conceive how much it importeth poor men and their Families to be in a moment dispoild of all their subsistence, and to be bereav'd perhaps of a few poor weather-beaten, water-drencht Reliques, which they had rescued out of the wrecks of their Fortunes in the late dreadful storm of Rebellion, but yet they may please to believe, that we are as much paind with the pressures of our Little fortunes, as they are with those of their great ones. I speak this not out of any pride I take in comparing great things with small, but only to dispose my Reader to a favourable construction of my words, if my zeal may seem to transport me beyond the bounds of decency.</P>
<P>Lastly I am not altogether without hope, but that something possibly may happen to be said in this Scribble, that may conduce to the healing up this wound again. For the Physitians have a good Aphorism, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Primus gradus sanitatis, est novisse morbum</FOREIGN>. The first degree of health is to know the na&rehy;ture of the disease.</P>
<P>I know some men are apt enough to alledge, that this case is the less con&rehy;siderable, because but a few persons are therein concerned. In this place I shall say no more, but that this Assertion is a great mistake. For first, our Money being expended for the defence of the Kingdome, it was laid out up&rehy;on the publick utility, and certainly it will be very disproportionable that the common advan&rehy;tage should be maintained by a private contribution, and upon this reason <IT>a person of great Honour and prudence</IT> not long since in an Audience of the whole <CORR
SIC="Kindome">Kingdome</CORR> doubted not to affirm, <IT>That this concern was little less then national</IT></P>
<P>But because this may seem to many to be but a precarious and begging Argument, and being founded upon a consideration of service and advantage, some time since done, may (in this ungrateful Age) prove but of mean regard. I will therefore Secondly, demonstrate this matter to be of Epidemical concernment in point of continuing and permanent interest: In order to this, I will supose that the King owes a Banker 1000<IT>l.</IT> this Banker owes me the like summ, I ow as much to a third, he to a fourth, and so in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">infinitum</FOREIGN>, and the Banker, my self, and the third person, have little else to satisfie our Creditors than this 1000<IT>l.</IT> which is owing severally to us. (which case may be well supposed to have hapned since the stop of the Ex&rehy;chequer) In this case then I say, it will be most evident, that if the King never payeth the Banker, the Banker can never pay me, or I the third per&rehy;son, or he the fourth, so that by a necessary chain of consequences, the 4<IT>th.</IT> person and his Creditors in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">infinitum</FOREIGN></IT>, are as much grieved by the King's <PB
N="[8]">non-payment of the Banker, as I my self, who am the Bankers immediate Creditor. For as (I said before) money is the blood of the Body Polli&rehy;tique, and we know if the circulation thereof be stopt in one Member, that blood can never be transmitted to the neighbouring Vein, and thereupon not only that part, but the whole body in fine becomes Feavourish and lan&rehy;guishant. The like may be said of Rents, Executorships, Legacies, &amp;c. And I doubt not but every man's consideration, and the particular interests of most persons, will furnish them with infinite instances of like nature, in a very little time.</P>
<P>But if this Reason prove not sufficiently pr&aelig;valent in this matter, I must be inforc'd to go a step higher, and to say, Thirdly, That if this procee&rehy;ding fall out to be an invasion of property (as I think I shall anon prove it is) then I say every individual person will be interressed in the Fate of this Cause. For by the same reason that the Rights of Ten thousand men may be violated, the Rights of Twenty thousand men may, and so in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">infi&rehy;nitum</FOREIGN>. And I think it is obvious to every man, that the publique and Par&rehy;liamentary Cares, and wisdome of this State have been extended in point of redressing Grievances, not only to bodies of men, in number much inferi&rehy;our to ours; but oftentimes even to particular persons, where the presures have been enormous. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>The Principal Creditours of the Bankers have been computed to a number, little <CORR
SIC="inferi&rehy;">inferiour</CORR> to this. The Creditors by consequence are far more</IT>.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the Answer I shall give to this Allegation at present, in the sequel of this discourse, very probably I may add more.</P>
<P>These things premis'd, <IT>I</IT> shall now forthwith address my self to the main business. In the Argument whereof I shall observe these Gradations, or steps.</P>
<P>1. First, <IT>I</IT> shall shortly put the case (as it now stands) between the King and the Bankers.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, <IT>I</IT> shall prove that by this Councel of stopping payments in the Exchequer, the Subjects property is invaded at Common Law.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, that hereby it is invaded contray to the Statute Law.</P>
<P>4. Fourthly, that this Councel is expresly <CORR SIC="contray">contrary</CORR> to his Majesties gracious promises and Declarations, Printed and promulgated by His own especial command.</P>
<P>5. Fifthly, I shall at large answer the grand Objection of necessity, and National danger (supposing too our fears to be at that time just) And shall prove by sundry Records and otherwise that the Subjects property is not violable but by his own consent, in cases of far greater National Dan&rehy;ger then this was. <IT>I</IT> shall answer, the Rapines of <IT>Ed.</IT> 1. and 3<IT>d.</IT> (and be&rehy;cause I would take up this Objection by the Roots) I shall then shew what courses the Law hath provided for preservation of the Kingdome, where the danger is instant and cannot stay for a Parliament.</P>
<P>6. Sixthly <IT>I</IT> shall prove that this Councel is <CORR SIC="contray">contrary</CORR> to the Pollicies <PB
N="[9]">hitherto used by the wisest Forreign States of the World, in far greater Exigencies then ours. I shall answer the Objection of some Princes not re&rehy;paying Money lent them by their Subjects, to retain them in better Obe&rehy;dience.</P>
<P>7. Seventhly, I shall prove this Councel to be contrary to common Reason, and in some respects to violate the Rules of Humanity. That it is pernicious to the credit of his Majesties Exchequer. Then I shall truly state the case between <IT>Phillip</IT> the 2<IT>d.</IT> of <IT>Spain</IT> and the Bankers of <IT>Genoa</IT>, and shall prove that case essentially different from ours.</P>
<P>And Lastly, shall frame a Conclusion upon the whole matter.</P>

<P>&Iic; think it is now evident enough to every man that understands any thing, that the concernment of the Bankers is now become the concernment of their Creditors, and that both their interests are common, and so insepe&rehy;rably twisted together, that the prosperity of the latter, will depend alto&rehy;gether upon the Fate of the former. Insomuch that if the Banker never receive his debt, I do not in probability see how he will be able to satisfie his Creditor: we are therefore by invincible necessity obliged to maintain the right of the Banker, and in order thereunto I will now put his Case, which in short is not more but this.
</P><P>A Banker lends to the King an hundred thousand pounds, more or less; this money is secured to the said Banker upon the Customes, or any other Branch of the King's Revenues, &amp;c. by Order Registred in the <IT>Exchequer</IT>, or by Talley of Loane, or both, and then the King (upon the War-like pre&rehy;parations of our neighbour Princes and States) is advised to make stop of all payments out of the Exchequer, which is executed accordingly; whe&rehy;ther by this Councel executed the Subjects property be invaded? and I clearly conceive it is.</P>

<IT>That by this Councel of stopping Payments out of the</IT> Ex&rehy;chequer, <IT>the Subjects properti is invaded at Common Law</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an Essential principle of the Law of this Realme, That the Subject hath an undoubted property in his Goods and Possessions. Otherwise there shall remain no more industry, no more Justice, no more valour, for who will labour? who will hazzard his person in the day of Battail for that which is not his own? How can the Subject by any Act of Bounty ingra&rehy;tiate himself with his Soveraign? Neither was this Right of propriety in&rehy;troduc't there by any Charter or Edict of Princes, but was the old Funda&rehy;mental Law, springing from the Original, Frame, and first Architecture of the Kingdome. There were manifest Footsteps of this Law in the Brittish, Roman, Saxon and Danish Governments here, nay it was of that vigour and puissance to survive even the very Norman Conquest; To prove which I shall crave leave to produce this following short memorable Record. <IT>One</IT> Shirboorn <IT>a Saxon at the time of the Conquest, being seized of a Castle and Lands in</IT> Norfolke, William <IT>the Conquerer gave the same to one</IT> War&rehy;ren <IT>a Norman, of principal Quality</IT>; Shirboorn <IT>dying, his Heir shewed to the Conquerour that he was his Subject, and that he ought to Inherit the said Castle and Land, by vertue of that Law which he himself had establisht in</IT> England. In this Case the Conquerour gave Judgement for <IT>Shirboorn</IT> a&rehy;gainst <IT>Warren</IT>, and pronounc'd his own former gift void. See for this <IT>Cambden</IT> in his Description of <IT>Norfolk</IT>. And Sir <IT>John Davis</IT> Rep. 41, a. The Case of <IT>Tanistry</IT>. And there it is said by Judge <IT>Calthrop</IT>, that he him&rehy;self had seen an Authentique Copy of this Judgement. <NOTE

<P>For indeed the Common Law is not more solicitous of any one thing then to preserve the property of the Subject from the inundation of the Prerogative, And therefore where a custome is to pay Toll for all Cat&rehy;tle that shall be driven over a common Bridge, this Custome shall bind the Subject but not the King; but where a Custome is to pay Toll for all Cattle that shall be driven over a mans private Freehold, there the Custome shall prevail against the Prerogative, and what is the Reason? why, be&rehy;cause the Law will not allow the King to invade the Subjects Inheritance and Property without consent and compensation, For this see the express book of 46 of <IT>Ed</IT>, 3. cited in <IT>Plowden</IT> 236. <IT>a.</IT> The Lord <IT>Barkley's</IT> case. Many other cases of this nature are there recited, and in other Books of our Law, which for brevity I forbear to mention.</P>
<PB N="[11]"><P>To come then to the Hinge upon which this point turns. I do lay this down for an indisputeable ground. That the Law of the Court of <IT>Exche&rehy;quer</IT> is the universal Law of this Land, and so is <IT>Plowden</IT> 320 <IT>b.</IT> and 321 <IT>b.</IT> The case of <IT>Mines</IT>, and <IT>Cook's</IT> 2<IT>d Report</IT> 16. <IT>b. Lanes</IT> case adjudg'd. Now then by the Law of the Exchequer, when the King hath charged himself to the Subject by Talley and liberate (as in our case) to pay a summe of money out of his Customes or any other branch of his Revenue, and his Collector hath received this Revenew; this money though at first it appertains in property to the King, yet as soon as ever the Kings Credi&rehy;tor comes to this Collector, and shewes him his Talley and Liberate, and demands payment accordingly, the property of this money (to the pro&rehy;portion of the Debt) by meer operation of Law, is transfer'd out of the King into the Collector or Receiver, and in an instant becomes the proper and personal Money of the said Collector, or Receiver; in respect of his charge over to the party. And so it is clearly affirmed by all the Judges of both Benches <IT>Plowden 186. a.</IT> Lord <IT>Darcyes</IT> case.
</P><P>And therefore if the King grant a summ of money to <IT>I. S.</IT> to be received out of his Customs of <IT>London</IT>, I say that by the delivery of the Talley Li&rehy;berate, and assets in the hands of the Customer, the Customer is become a Debtor to <IT>I.S.</IT> and he may bring his Action of Debt upon this matter against the Customer. <IT>Coke's 4 Institutes, 116.

LANG="FRA">d'</FOREIGN>Exche&rehy;quer. 1. 37. H. 6. 15. Brooke ibid. 3.</IT></P>
<P>Nay in such case if the Receiver dye, the Action will lye against his Ex&rehy;ecutor. And therefore where the King had granted a Fee by Patent to the Clercke of the Parliament to be received out of the profits of the Hana&rehy;par, and the Clercke of the Hanapar dyed, yet adjudged that debt would well lye against his Executor, because so much of the Kings money was al&rehy;tered in property in the hands of the Testator, and yet here was no con&rehy;tract, privity in word, suit or Execution of Law between the King and Testator, or Executor, 2. <IT>Hen. 7. 8. b. &amp;c. Fitzh. Bar. 124. Plowden 36. b. and 186. a.</IT> So if the King assign Talleys upon the Dismes (gran&rehy;ted him by Parliament) to his Creditors, and they shew them to the Col&rehy;lectors of the Dismes, the King is hereby discharged, and the Collectors are charg'd, and the King cannot pardon the Collectors, or the Clergy which granted the Dismes. <IT>1. Hen. 7. 8. a. Brook Charter <FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">de</FOREIGN> pardon</IT>, 37. Nay so careful is the Law of the Subjects property in such case, that if af&rehy;ter a like grant of the Disms, the King should dye, yet the Collectors are chargeable to the King's Grantee and not to his Successor. <IT>1. Hen. 7. 8. a. <FOREIGN

<P><IT>Ob.</IT> Now if any man shall say to me. Sir you have abundantly prov'd the <PB
N="[12]">stopping of the Exchequer, to be an invasion of Property as to the Colle&rehy;ctor and Customer, and the like by the Common Law, but nothing at all as to the Banker or his Creditor, which was the position you undertook to maintain.</P>
<P>To this Objection, I give this plain Answer. <IT>That the stop of the Ex&rehy;chequer to the Collectors, Customers, &amp;c. is by inevitable consequence a stop to the Bankers and their <CORR
SIC="Credior">Creditors</CORR>, (and so likewise their property viola&rehy;ted) because by this Obstruction the Collector, &amp;c. is disabled to satisfy the Banker, and the Banker his Creditor, and that Creditor his Creditor, and so in an infinite rotation throughout the <CORR
SIC="Kingdomi">Kingdom</CORR>: just as a wrongful dis&rehy;inheritance of the Grandfather, is an injury to the Father, and Son, and so to all their Line in <CORR
SIC="suecession">succession</CORR> to the worlds end. Or (because this is the Hinge of the case as to the Common Law, and I would make it plain) I will suppose twenty Mills to be built upon one River, each of them in sequence one below the other, a person comes and damms up this River, or diverts the current thereof into a new Channel; I do say that by this diversion or Ob&rehy;struction of the Stream the 20th Mill is injured as well as the first, because (if there were no Impediment) that water which comes to the first Mill would at the long run arrive to the twentieth</IT>.</P>
<P>In so plain a case I need not make any Application, or indeed use any farther Argument as to the Common law-part of this discourse. I shall therefore cite but one other case, and that a far stronger one then ours, and then discharge my self of this Section.</P>
<P>The Case is <IT>Mich.</IT> 1. <IT>Hen.</IT> 7. <IT>Fol.</IT> 3. <IT>b.</IT> and abridg'd by <IT>Fitzherbert Barr.</IT> 122. <Q
REND="it" LANG="FRA">Touts les Justices fueront al <RO>White Fryers</RO> pur lour Fees, &amp;c.</Q> (saith the Book) All the Judges were assembled at <IT>White Fryars</IT> to con&rehy;sult about the payment of their Salleries which were behind. And their Case was this. By a Statute made 18. <IT>Hen.</IT> 6. it is Enacted that the Custo&rehy;mers shall pay the Judges their Salleries, out of the first Moneys arising out of the Customes of <IT>London</IT>. And then <IT>Richard</IT> the third grants License to certain Merchants to carry Wools, and to retain the Customs thereof in their own hands (which was as it were a little diminutive stopping of the Exchequer as to the Judges in this Case) And the question was whether the Customers shall be chargeable to the Judges for those reteinments of the Merchants; and after mature debate, Resolved by them all, That the Customers were chargeable even for those reteinments, though they ne&rehy;ver came to their hands; and in the end of that case, it is said, that the Judges design'd each of them to bring his Action against the Customers, which they perceiving, they forthwith agreed with the Judges to pay them their Salleries.</P>
<PB N="[13]"><P>Now any man that shall well consider this case will find the Reason thereof to be, because though the King had granted the Priveledge of re&rehy;teining the Customes to these Merchants, yet in contemplation of Law, the Customers did still actually receive those Customes, and so were chargea&rehy;ble to the Judges (like the case I put before of <IT>Hen.</IT> 7. 8. <IT>a.</IT> where the King remitted the Dismes to the Collector, or Clergy) and the rather in this case, because this private License of the Kings shall not prevail over an act of Parliament, which had secured unto them their Salaries out of the Cu&rehy;stomes, which leads me to the next position which I have proposed to assert, which is.</P>

<PB N="[14]"><P><Q REND="it">Whereas it hath been found by experience upon the late Act for Twelve hundred and fifty thousand pounds, made at <RO>Oxford,</RO> and other Acts of Parliament since that time, that the power of Assigning of Orders in the <RO>Ex&rehy;chequer</RO> upon those Acts, without Revocation, hath been of great use and advantage to the persons concerned in them, and to the Trade of this King&rehy;dome, and given great Credit to his Majesties Exchequer: Be it Ena&rehy;cted and it is hereby Enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled,<RO>That every person</RO> or persons, Native or Forreigner, Bodies Politique or Corporate, <RO>to whom any Moneys shall be due in your Majesties</RO> Exchequer, <RO>and shall have any Order Registred in the Office of the Auditor of the Receipt, for the pay&rehy;ment thereof out of any branch of your Majesties Revenue;</RO> That such person or persons, Native or Forreigner, Bodies Politique, or Corporate, their Successors, Executors, Administrators or Assigns, respectively, by Endorsement of their Order, <RO>may Assign</RO> and transfer <RO>their Right, Title, Interest and Benefit of such Order,</RO> or any part thereof, to any other; which being notified in the Office of the Auditor of the Receipt aforesaid, and an Entry and Memorial thereof also made in the Book of Registry aforesaid for such Orders (which the Officers shall on request accordigly make) shall Entitle such Assignee, his Executors, Administrators and Assigns, or Suc&rehy;cessors respectively, to the benefit thereof, and payment thereon.</Q> Now it will be plain to any man that shall consider this Statute, that the Parliament doth therein admit an unquestionable duty of the Mony, to the Lenders in the <IT>Ex&rehy;chequer</IT> (for so are the words, Every person to whom any mony shal be due in your Majesties Exchequer &amp;c.) and the makers of this Act, could never mean that nothing should be transferd to the Assignee: For indeed all the Powers of the Universe can never make me Donor of that which never ap&rehy;pertained to me, nor I never had in me to give, And therefore this money must first of necessity vest in my self in point of property, before I can transfer it to another person, so then if this Law secure this money to my Assignee, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">a multo fortiori</FOREIGN> to my self. Now that this Statute secures this money to my Assignee, I shall prove by three unanswerable reasons (as I suppose) all drawn out of the Bowels of this very Law it self. <NOTE
LANG="LAT" REND="marginalia" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Nit dat quod non habet.</IT></NOTE>
</P><P>First, the Inducements of this Statute appear in the preamble thereof to be. Advantage to the persons concern'd. To the Trade of the Kindome, and also great credit to the Exchequer. Therefore the makers of this Law could never design a transferring of the husk or shell only, that is of the Order or Paper, but even of the fruit it self, I mean the money in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">specie</FOREIGN>, for that is it which carryes the Advantage, the Trade, and the credit with it and not the Order or writings as many of us find by wofull Experi&rehy;ence.</P>
<PB N="[15]"><P>Secondly, there is no man doubts but that the moneys lent upon the <IT>Oxford</IT> Act of 17. <IT>Car.</IT> 2. <IT>cap.</IT> 1. for 1250000<IT>l.</IT> And upon the Pole-mo&rehy;ny, Bill. 18 <IT>Car.</IT> 2. <IT>cap.</IT> 1. And upon the Act of 19 <IT>Car.</IT> 2 <IT>cap.</IT> 8 for 1256000<IT>l.</IT> were unquestionably secured to the Assignees of the Lenders by those several Acts; why then I say that all moneys since that time Lent into the <IT>Exchequer</IT>, & charg'd upon any branch of the King's Revenue, are equal&rehy;ly secur'd to them by this Act, and that not only first because this Act in the preamble thereof refers expresly to those other Acts; But Secondly, (then which I think nothing can be plainer) because the moneys secured by this Act to the Assignees are secured with almost all the same numerical, iden&rehy;tical words, with which the moneys lent upon the three other Acts are se&rehy;cured: And this will be obvious to any person that shall curiously com&rehy;pare all these Acts together, to the which for brevity sake I am inforc't to refer my Reader.
</P><P>Lastly, this Act declares in express terms that the Assignees of such Or&rehy;ders for money due in the Exchequer, their Executors Administrators and Assignes in <FOREIGN

<P>I had almost forgot to observe that this Law (the King being therein concerned) is a general Act of Parliament, of the which not only the Judges, but even every individual Subject of this Kingdome ought to take knowledge of course; for as the inferiour Members (saith the Book) can&rehy;not estrange themselves from the actions and passions of the head, no more can any Subject be a stranger to the concernments of his Sovereign. <NOTE

<P>&Iic; am now at length arrived to the grand Objection of this case, the vali&rehy;dity of which I am necessitated (though with reluctancy in my self) to consider, because if this Objection prove impregnable, the Councel of stopping the Exchequer may seem to be built upon a good, or at leastwise an <CORR
SIC="exccusable">excusable</CORR> foundation, and so in all that <IT>I</IT> have hitherto said, <IT>I</IT> shall seem to have trifled with and eluded my Reader. And herein (because <IT>I</IT> pretend not to any Arcanums of State) <IT>I</IT> shall handle this point by way of Ad&rehy;mittance and shall suppose that the fears and jealousies which at the time of shutting the Exchequer did possess this State were just, and such as might well fall upon constant and deliberating mindes. The Objection then will run thus.
</P><P>Ob. <NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Ob.</IT></NOTE> <IT>That our Neighbour Princes and States were making vast prepa&rehy;rations for War, that the Heavens about us were black and Cloudy, and where the storm might fall no man could Divine. That</IT> <FOREIGN

That it is more eligible to lop off one member from the Body Politique, or at least wise to let an Arm, or perhaps a finger thereof blood, then that the whole should be endangered, &amp;c.</IT></P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> <NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Sol.</IT></NOTE> The Objection <IT>I</IT> must confess is important and weighty, and will deserve a substantial Answer. In order thereunto <IT>I</IT> must in the first place mind my Reader that <IT>I</IT> have (as <IT>I</IT> suppose) by irrafregable Argument proved the property of the Subject in this case violated. <IT>I</IT> will then add, that it is a Fundamental Law of this Realm that the Subjects propriety is not violable, no not in cases of National Danger, without his own free and voluntary consent, and that, First by the consent of his own individual <PB
N="[20]">person, or Secondly by that of his Representatives in <IT>Parliament</IT>, to whom he hath delegated his consent. To prove this I could produce in&rehy;finite Records of Parliament and other Courts, but (for brevities sake) shall content my self with some few, doing herein like one that chooseth 5 or 6. full eares of Wheat out of a select sheaf, who must necessarily leave behind him as good as he takes.</P>
<P>The first Record therefore that I shall insist upon, will be that memora&rehy;ble one of 14. <IT>Ed.</IT> 2. in a Writt of Error upon a judgement given in <IT>Dur&rehy;ham</IT> in Trespass by <IT>Heyburne</IT> against <IT>Keylow</IT>, for entring his house, brea&rehy;king his Chest, and taking away 70<IT>l.</IT> in money upon a special verdict, the case was this.</P>
<P>The Scots had entred the Bishoprick with a formidable Army, making great burnings and spoil, the Commonalty of <IT>Durham</IT> (whereof the Plaintiff was one) apprehensive of the common danger, consulted toge&rehy;ther, and at length agreed to send their agents to compound with the Scots, for money to depart, and were all sworn (the Plaintiff being one) to per&rehy;form such composition, and also what Ordinance should be made in that behalf, thereupon they compounded with the Scots for 1600 Marks, but because this Money was to be paid without the least delay, they all con&rehy;sented that <IT>Keylow</IT> the Defen&rehy;dant and others, should go into every mans house, to search for ready Money, to make up the said summe, and that it should be repayd by the same Commonalty, and thereupon the Defendant entred the Plaintiffs house, and took the said 70<IT>l</IT>, which was paid to&rehy;ward that Fine. The Jury were demanded whether the Plaintiff was pre&rehy;sent and consented to the taking of the Money, they said no. Whereupon the Plaintiff had Judgement to recover the 70<IT>l.</IT> upon this Judgement the Defendant brings his Writt of Error in the Kings Bench, and assigns er&rehy;rour in point of Law, and there the Judgement was reverst, because <IT>Hey&rehy;burn</IT> (whose Money it was) had agreed to this Ordinance, and was sworn to perform it, and <IT>Keylow</IT> had done nothing but by the express consent of <IT>Heyburn</IT>, and therefore was no Trespassor, and that <IT>Heyburn</IT> had no other remedy for his Money, but against the Commonalty of <IT>Durham</IT>. By which it appeareth, that if the owner of the money had not particularly concented, such Ordinance could not have bound him, and yet this was in a case of imminent danger, and for publique defence. <NOTE

<P>The next is a Record of the Parliament of 20 <IT>Ri.</IT> 2. some little time be&rehy;fore this Session, the French had actually invaded this Realm, they had burnt <IT>Portsmouth, Dertmouth, Plymouth, Rye</IT> and <IT>Hastings</IT>, they had possest themselves of the Isle of <IT>Wight</IT>, beseiged <IT>Winchelsy</IT>, and at length entring the <IT>Thames</IT> with their victorious Fleet, came up to <IT>Craves end</IT>, and burnt most part of that Town, and (which was yet worse) in the North, the Scots had burnt <IT>Roxborough</IT>, and were ready to over run all the North <PB
N="[21]">of <IT>England</IT>, the Realme being thus beset both by Sea and Land with the united puissance of two mighty Kingdomes, and like a Candle burning at both ends, the publique Treasure also exhaust; a great Councel was forthwith call'd of the Prelacy, Baronage, and other great men, and Sages (or Judg&rehy;es) of the Nation, to consult about these difficulties, they came at length to a final resolution, the which <IT>Scroop</IT>, then Lord Chancellour, delivered to all the Lords in the ensuing Parliament, which (as the Roll above quo&rehy;ted saith) was thus. That since the last Parliament, the said Councel met, and considering the great danger the Kingdome was in, and how money might be raised for the Common Defence, which could not wait the delay of a Parliament, and how the Kings Coffers had not sufficient in them, they all concluded that money could not be had for such defence, without lay&rehy;ing a charge upon the Commonalty, and that such charge could not be im&rehy;posed without a <IT>Parliament</IT>; and the Lords thereupon supplyed the pre&rehy;sent necessity with their own money, and advised a Parliament for farther supply, and Repayment of themselves, which was accordingly done. <NOTE

<P>I think no man will pretend that our late danger (to say no more) was greater than this; and yet because there was no other course in those times thought lawful for the raising Treasure upon the Subjects Goods then by their own ascent in Parliament, only that course was then thought fittest to be practised, which was such as ought to be obeyed.</P>
<P>The next Record is the Statute of 31. <IT>Hen.</IT> 8. <IT>cap.</IT> 8. some years be&rehy;fore, this King had dissolved the lesser, and in the year of this Satute the greater Monasteries; which being a new precedent made a great noise, and the event thereof was apprehended with terrour and amazement all over the Christian world, this administred secret feeds of discontent to ma&rehy;ny of the people, which after broke out into open Rebellions (as our Chronicles declare) in several parts of the Kingdome; this King (though standing as much upon his pr&aelig;rogative as any of his Predecessors) to provide against the like suddain eruptions of this Torrent, which would not stay for Parliaments, procures a Statute to be made, that the King for the time being, with the Advice of his Councel, two Bishops, two chief Justices, and divers others, might by His Proclamation, make Ordinances for punishing offences, and imposing penalties, which should have the force of a Law, but with this proviso [that thereby no mans life, or property, Lands or Goods should be toucht or impeacht] so then though the Roy&rehy;al Power was thus corroborated by this Statute, yet the Parliament took care, that no mans Life or Property should be ravisht from him. How&rehy;ever notwithstanding the said Restriction, this Statute was thought incon&rehy;venient, and thereupon repealed soon after, in 1. <IT>Ed.</IT> 6. <IT>cap.</IT> 12. <NOTE

<P>First the Judgement of the two Houses in that Parliament in Dr. <IT>Man&rehy;warings</IT> case, who was sentenc'd by them principally for declaring in a Sermon (which he afterwards Printed) that the King in Cases of immi&rehy;nent danger to the Kingdome, might without Parliament Levy Money up&rehy;on the Subject. <NOTE

<P>The second is the Commission for <IT>Loane</IT>, to carry on the War for the <IT>Palatinate</IT>, in which was suggested the safety and very subsistance of the King, People, and Religion to be in instant danger, that his Majestie's <NOTE

<P>In the last place I shall cite the Statute of 17. <IT>Car.</IT> 1. <IT>cap.</IT> 14. For the Reversal of the Judgement in the case of the Ship-writs, I am not willing (as well of brevity as other reasons) to recite this Statute at large, but I dare engage that no man shall read that Law, but will say it is a most di&rehy;rect Judgement in the point against the violation of propriety in case of National danger. If any man however, shall for reasons best known to himself, Arraign or Calumniate this Act of Parliament, I shall say no more then this. If it be Law, why may I not vouch it? If it be not, why is it not Repeald? why doth it still cumber our Statute Books?</P>
<P>I am heartily sorry to have had so invincible an occasion administred to me here, of disturbing the Rest of these sleeping Muniments of propriety; but this presumption also must be added to the black train of those Cala&rehy;mities which follow this pernicious Councel.

</P><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Sol.</IT></NOTE> To this I answer, That all Warrs are either Offensive of Defensive. If it be Offensive, it cannot be suddain, for it is the King's own Act, and the result of mature deliberation; and so <CORR

There prevail'd at that time an universal jealousy among the people that upon this occasion some suddain stop might be put upon the Exchequer, and thereupon the Bankers were exercised with restless soli&rehy;citations for the speedy payment of their Debts. The King for the sedati&rehy;on of these Fears and apprehensions, is advised (and not without infinite prudence) to issue forthwith his Declaration to preserve inviolable the course of payments in the Exchequer, which was accordingly done.

<P>&Tic;Hus (Sir) I have (as you see according to the <IT>Model</IT> of my weak <IT>Ta&rehy;lent</IT>) discovered the <IT>Enormity</IT> and pernicious <IT>Influences</IT> of this <IT>Ad&rehy;vice</IT>, I take God to witness I have done this, without the least <IT>Ma&rehy;lice</IT> or <IT>Designe</IT> against any man's person, of what <IT>Degree</IT> or <IT>Quali&rehy;ty</IT> soever; Indeed if any man shall come from behind the <IT>Curtain</IT> & with a <IT>bare</IT> & open <IT>face</IT> shall say <IT>I am the Man that gave this Advice</IT>. That per&rehy;son I must confess (and only that person) hath not escapt my <IT>Animadver&rehy;sions</IT>, and from <IT>him</IT> only, and no <IT>body</IT> else I hope I can with <IT>Reason</IT>, expect <IT>Reproof</IT>. And then let all <IT>Mankind</IT> judge, whether of the two is more to be blamed, he that hath lead his <IT>Prince</IT> out of the <IT>old <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">via Regia</FOREIGN></IT> or King's high way, into by and <IT>untrodden Paths</IT>, unknown <IT>to the Law</IT>, and to walk upon <IT>Precipices</IT>, or he that hath given an honest <IT>Alarm</IT> or <IT>Outcry</IT> of this evil <IT>Dealing</IT>.
</P><P>The Lord Treasurer <IT>Burleigh</IT> (under whose old <IT>English Councels</IT> this <IT>Kingdome</IT> flourisht, and became <IT>formidable</IT> to all the world, and one per&rehy;haps that better understood the <IT>Genius</IT> and <IT>temper</IT> of this <IT>Nation</IT> then this <IT>Advisor</IT>) was used to tell his Queen. <NOTE

<P>The great <IT>God</IT> of <IT>Heaven</IT> and <IT>Earth</IT> and my own <IT>Conscience</IT> will be my <IT>Compurgators</IT> and Witnesses, that whatever I have said in this <IT>Discourse</IT>, I have done it with a most ardent and passionate <IT>Desire</IT> of the <IT>Prosperity</IT> of my dread <IT>Soveraign</IT>, and an unfeined <IT>Love</IT> to my dear <IT>Countreymen</IT>, and to raise and <IT>enkindle</IT> (as well as I could) an universal <IT>Disposition</IT> in this <IT>Kingdome</IT> towards the <IT>Payment</IT> of this <IT>Debt</IT>; That thereupon so conside<PB

<P>I shall probably be thought by some persons to have prosecuted this <IT>Ar&rehy;gument</IT> with a warmer <IT>Zeal</IT> then became mee, and to have <IT>sallied</IT> out sometimes perhaps into <IT>Extravagancies</IT> and <IT>Inconsideration</IT>: I can only <IT>Reply</IT>, that the <IT>Authors</IT> and <IT>Testimonies</IT> by me vouched, are <IT>Authentique</IT>, and of approved <IT>Credit</IT>, and by me <IT>truly</IT> and <IT>carefully quoted</IT>, That after I have sacrificed my <IT>Person</IT> and <IT>Fortunes</IT> to mine <IT>Allegiance</IT> in the Late <IT>Rebellion</IT>; no man I hope will suppose that I should now become <IT>Apostate</IT> or <IT>Renegado</IT> to so <IT>glorious a Cause, That Necessity, and the want of a mans own, are spurs sharp and invincible</IT>; And <IT>Lastly</IT> that I have been <IT>actuated</IT> all along in this <IT>Discourse</IT> with no other <IT>Impulses</IT> of <IT>mind</IT>, then those which loosen'd the <IT>Tongue</IT> of the <IT>Dumb</IT> Son of King <IT>Cr&oelig;sus</IT>, when he saw a <IT>Sol&rehy;dier</IT> ready to offer <IT>violence</IT> to his <IT>Father</IT> crying out, <IT>It is the King!</IT> At whose <IT>Royal Feet</IT> I am alwayes ready upon <IT>Occasion</IT> to lay down my <IT>Life</IT>, together with that poor <IT>Mite</IT> or <IT>Fragment</IT> of <IT>Estate</IT>, which the <IT>Rebbels</IT> and this <IT>Advisor</IT> have left me: Praying (in the <IT>Scripture</IT> Language) <IT>That God would strike through the Loins of all them that hate His Majesty, but that upon his own Head his Crown may for ever flourish</IT>.</P>
