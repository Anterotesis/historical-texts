<SP><SPEAKER rend=it>Barrister.</SPEAKER>
<P>&Mic;Y old <it>Client</IT>! a good morning to you, whither so fast? you seem intent upon some important affair?</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER rend=it>Juryman.</SPEAKER><P> Worthy Sir! I am glad to see you thus <it>oppor&rehy;tunely</IT>, there being scarce any person that I could at this time rather have wisht to meet with.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> I shall esteem my self happy, if in any thing I can serve you. &horfill; The <it>business</IT> I pray?</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> I am summon'd to appear <it>upon a Jury</IT>, and was just going to try if I could get off. Now I doubt not but you can put me into the best way to obtain that favour.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> 'Tis probable I could. But first let me know the <it>reasons</IT> why you desire to <it>decline that service</IT>.</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The Reasons why fit men endeavour sometimes to avoid serving on Juries.</NOTE> <SP><SPEAKER REND="it">Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> You know, Sir, there is something of <it>trouble</IT> and <it>loss of time</IT> in it; and mens <it>Lives, Liberties</IT>, and <it>Estates</IT> (which depend upon a Jury's <it>Guilty</IT>, or <it>Not guilty</IT>, for the Plaintiff, or for the Defendant) are <it>weighty things</IT>. I would not wrong my Conscience for a world, nor be accessary to any mans ruin. There are others <it>better skill'd</IT> in such matters. I have ever so loved <it>peace</IT>, that I have forborn going to <it>Law</IT>, (as you well know many times) though it hath been much to my loss.</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Not sufficient.</NOTE> <SP><SPEAKER REND="it">Barr.</SPEAKER><P> I commend your <it>tenderness</IT> and <it>modesty</IT>; yet must tell you, these are but general and <it>weak</IT> excuses. As for your time and trouble, 'tis not <it>much</IT>; and however, can it be bet&rehy;ter spent than in doing <it>justice</IT>, and serving your Country? To withdraw your self in such cases, is a kind of <it>Sacriledg</IT>, a robbing of the publick of those duties which you justly owe it; the more <it>peaceable</IT> man you have been, the <it>more fit</IT> you are. For the office of a <it>Jury-man</IT> is, <it>conscientiously to judg his neighbour</IT>; and needs no more <it>Law</IT> than is easily learnt to di&rehy;rect him therein. I look upon you therefore as a man well<PB
N="2">qualified with <it>estate, discretion</IT>, and <it>integrity</IT>; and if all such as you, should use private means to avoid it, how would the King and Country be honestly served? At that rate we should have none but <it>Fools</IT> or <it>Knaves</IT> intrusted in this grand con&rehy;cern, on which (as you well observe) the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of all <it>Englishmen</IT> depend.</P>
<P>Your <it>Tenderness</IT> not be accessary to any mans being wrong'd or ruin'd, is (as I said) much to be commended. But may you not incur it unawares, by seeking thus to <it>avoid</IT> it? <it>Pilate</IT> was not innocent because he washt his hands, and said, <it>He would have nothing to do with the blood of that just one</IT>. There are faults of <it>Omission</IT> as well as <it>Commission</IT>. When you are <it>legally call'd</IT> to try such a cause, if you shall <it>shuffle</IT> out your self, and thereby persons perhaps <it>less conscientious</IT> happen to be made use of, and so a <it>Villain</IT> escapes justice, or an <it>innocent</IT> man is ruined by a <it>prepossest</IT> or <it>negligent</IT> Verdict; can you think your self in such a case wholly blameless? <it><FOREIGN rend=it LANG="LAT">Qui non prohibet cum potest, jubet</FOREIGN>: He abets evil, that prevents it not when he may. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Nec caret scrupulo societatis occult&aelig; qui evi&rehy;denter facinori defenit obviare</FOREIGN>: He deserves not to be free from the suspition of a close society, or underhand conspiracy in the mischief of subverting the fundamental Laws and Liberties of the Nation, who ceases to obviate and oppose it</IT>.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> Truly I think a man is bound to <it>do all the good</IT> he can, especially when he is lawfully call'd to it. But there sometimes happen <it>nice cases</IT>, wherein it may be difficult to discharge ones conscience without incurring the <it>displeasure</IT> of the Court, and thence <it>trouble</IT> and <it>damage</IT> may arise.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> That is but a <it>vain</IT> and <it>needless</IT> fear. For as the Ju&rehy;rors <it>priviledges</IT> (and every <it>English-mans</IT> in and by them) are very considerable; So the Laws have no less providently <it>guarded</IT> them against Invasion or Usurpation. So that there needs no more than first <it>understanding</IT> to know your duty, and in the next place <it>courage</IT> and <it>resolution</IT> to practise it with impartiality and integrity, free from accursed <it>bribery</IT> and ma&rehy;lice, or (what is full out as bad in the end) base and servile <it>fear</IT>.</P></SP>
<PB N="3"><SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> I am satisfied, that as 'tis for the <it>advantage</IT> and ho&rehy;nour of the publick, that men of <it>understanding, substance</IT>, and <it>honesty</IT> should be employ'd to serve on Juries, that <it>justice</IT> and <it>right</IT> may fairly be administred; So 'tis <it>their own</IT> interest when called thereunto, readily to bestow their attendance and ser&rehy;vice, to prevent <it>ill presidents</IT> from men otherwise qualified; which may by degrees <it>fatally</IT>, though insensibly, undermine our just Birth-rights, and perhaps <it>fall heavy</IT> one day upon us, or our posterity. But for my own part, I am fearful lest I should suffer through my <it>ignorance</IT> of the duty and office of a Jury&rehy;man, and therefore on that account principally it is, that I de&rehy;sire to be excused in my appearance, which if I understood but so well as I hope many others do, I would with all my heart attend the service.</P></SP><SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER> <P>You speak honestly, and like an <it>Englishman</IT>. But if that be all your cause of scruple, it may soon be removed, if you will but your self a very <it>little trouble</IT> of inquiry into the necessary provisions of the Law of <it>Engl.</IT> relating to this matter.</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The Antiquity of Trials by Juries.</NOTE><SP><speaker rend=it>J.</SPEAKER> <P>There is nothing (of a <it>temporal</IT> concern) that I would more gladly be inform'd in, because I am satisfied, 'tis very <it>ex&rehy;pedient</IT> to be generally known. And first I would learn <it>how long</IT> trials by Juries have been used in this Nation?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> Even <it>time out of mind</IT>; so long, that our best <it>Historians</IT> cannot date the Original of the Institution, being indeed <it>cotem&rehy;porary</IT> with the Nation it self, or in use as soon as the people were reduced to any form of <it>Civil</IT> Government, and admini&rehy;stration of Justice. Nor have the several Conquests or Revo&rehy;lutions, the mixtures of <it>Foreigners</IT>, or the mutual feuds of the <it>Natives</IT>, at any time been able to suppress or overthrow it. For,</P>

</P></SP><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Essays made to overthrow Trials by Ju&rehy;ries, always unsuccessful, and severely punisht.</NOTE>
<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> 'Tis but rarely that any have arrived to so great a con&rehy;fidence: <it>For 'tis a most dangerous thing to shake or alter any of the rules or fundamental points of the common Law, which in truth are the main pillars and supporters of the fabrick of the Commonwealth</IT>. These are Judg <it>Cooks</IT> words. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="margin">2. Institutes, <it>pag.</IT> 74.</NOTE> Yet sometimes it has been endeavoured. But so sacred and valuable was the Institution in the eyes of our Ancestors, and so tenacious were they of their Priviledges, and zealous to maintain and pre&rehy;serve such a <it>vital part</IT> of their Birth-right and Freedom, that no such attempts could ever prove effectual, but always end&rehy;ed with shame and severe punishment of the rash under&rehy;takers. For example,</P>
<P>1. <it>Andrew Horn</IT> an eminent Lawyer, in his Book Entituled, <it>The Mirrour of Justices</IT>, (written in the Reign of K. <it>Edw.</IT> I. now near 400 years ago) in the fifth Chapter, and first Secti&rehy;on, records, That the renowned <it>Saxon</IT> King <it>Alfred</IT> caused <it>four and forty</IT> Justices to be <it>hang'd</IT> in one year as <it>murtherers</IT>, for their <it>false Judgments</IT>. And there recites their particular Crimes, most of them being in one kind or other Infringe&rehy;ments, Violations and Encroachments of and upon the Rights and Priviledges of Juries; amongst the rest, that worthy Au&rehy;thor tells us, he <it>hanged one Justice</IT> Cadwine, <it>because he judged one</IT> Hackwy <it>to death without the consent of all the Jurors; for whereas he stood upon his Jury of twelve men, because three of them would have saved him, this</IT> Cadwine <it>removed those three, and put others in their room, on the Jury, against the said</IT> Hackwy's <it>consent</IT>. Where we may observe, that though at last twelve men did give a Verdict against him, yet those so <PB
N="6">put upon him, were not accounted <it>his Jurors</IT>; by reason all, or any of them, who were first sworn to try him, could not (by <it>Law</IT>) be removed, and others put in their stead. And that such <it>illegal</IT> alteration was then adjudged a <it>Capital</IT> Crime, and forth&rehy;with the said <it>Cadwine</IT> was <it>Hang'd</IT>.</P>
<P>2. A second instance I shall give you in the words of the Lord Chief Justice <it>Cook</IT>. <NOTE TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><it>Cook 2. part</IT> of Institutes, <it>fol.</IT> 51.</NOTE> <Q>"Against this ancient and <it>funda&rehy;mental Law</IT> (and in the face thereof) there was in the 11. year of King <it>Henry</IT> 7. cap. 3. an Act of Parliament obtain&rehy;ed (on fair pretences, and a <it>specious preamble</IT>, as to avoid divers mischiefs, <it>&amp;c.</IT>) whereby it was Ordain'd, <it>That from thenceforth, as well Justices of Assize, as Justices of the Peace, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, with&rehy;out any finding or presentment by the Verdict of Twelve men should have full power and authority by their discretions to hear and determine all offences and contempts committed or done by any person or persons against the Form, Ordinance, or effect of any statute made and not repealed</IT>, &amp;c. "By colour of which Act (saith <it>Cook</IT>) shaking this Fundamental Law (<it>it means, touching all Trials to be by</IT> Juries) it is not credible what HORRIBLE OPPRESSIONS and EXACTIONS, to the undoing of MULTITUDES of people, were commit&rehy;ted by Sir <it>Richard Empson</IT> Knight, and <it>Edmund Dudley</IT>, Esq; (being Justices of the Peace) throughout <it>England</IT>, and upon this unjust and injurious Act (as commonly in like cases it falleth out) a <it>new Office</IT> was erected, and they made Masters of the Kings Forfeitures.</Q></P>
<P>But not only this Statute was justly soon after the decease of <it>Hen. 7 repealed</IT> by the Statute of the 1 <it>Hen.</IT> 8. <it>cap.</IT> 6. but also the said <it>Empson</IT> and <it>Dudley</IT> (notwithstanding they had such an <it>Act</IT> to back them, yet it being against <it>Magna Charta</IT>, and consequently <it>void</IT>) were fairly <it>executed</IT> for their pains; and several of their under agents, as <it>Promoters, Informers</IT>, and the like, severely <it>punisht</IT>, for a warning to all others that shall dare (on any pretence whatsoever) infringe our <it>English</IT> Liberties. <NOTE

<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The benefits of being tri&rehy;ed by Juries.</NOTE> <SP><speaker rend=it>J.</SPEAKER><P> Yes surely; and by what you have discoursed of the <it>long continued use of Juries</IT>, and the zealous regards our An&rehy;cestors had, not to part with them; I perceive that they were esteemed a <it>special priviledg</IT>. Be pleased therefore to ac&rehy;quaint me wherein the <it>excellency</IT> and <it>advantages</IT> to the people by that method of trial above others, may consist?</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">See all this excellently made out, and more at large by the L.C.J. <it>Fortescue</IT>, af&rehy;terwards Chancellor to K. <it>Hen.</IT> 6. in his Book, <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De laudibus Legum Angli&aelig;. cap. 26,27,28, & 29.</FOREIGN></IT></NOTE> <SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> This question shews you have not been much conver&rehy;sant <it>abroad</IT>, to observe the <it>miserable</IT> condition of the poor people in most <it>other Nations</IT>, where they are either <it>wholly sub&rehy;ject</IT> to the <it>despotick arbitrary</IT> lusts of their Rulers; or at best under such Laws as render their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, liable to be disposed of at the <it>discretion</IT> of strangers appoin&rehy;ted their Judges, most times <it>mercinary</IT>, and Creatures of Pre&rehy;rogative; sometimes <it>malicious</IT> and oppressive, and often <it>par&rehy;tial</IT> and corrupt. Or suppose them never so <it>just and upright</IT> yet still has the Subject no security against the attacks of un&rehy;conscionable <it>Witnesses</IT>; yea, when there is <it>no sufficient Evi&rehy;dence</IT>, upon bare suspicions they are obnoxious to the <it>Tor&rehy;tures of the Rack</IT>, which often make an <it>innocent</IT> man con&rehy;fess himself <it>guilty</IT>, meerly to get out of present pain. Is it not then an <it>inestimable happiness</IT> to be born and live under such a <it>mild</IT> and righteous Constitution wherein <it>all these mischiefs</IT> (as far as humane prudence can provide) are prevented; where none can be condemn'd, either by the <it>power</IT> of supe&rehy;rior enemies, or the <it>rashness</IT> or <it>ill will</IT> of any <it>Judg</IT>, nor by the bold Affirmations of any <it>profligate evidence</IT>; But no less than <it>Twelve, honest, substantial, impartial men</IT>, his <it>neighbours</IT> (who consequently cannot be presumed to be unacquainted either with the matters charged, the Prisoner's course of life, or the credit of the Evidence) must first be <it>fully satisfied</IT> in their Consciences, that he is <it>guilty</IT>, and so all unanimously <PB N="8">pronounce him upon their <it>Oaths</IT>. Are not these, think you very <it>material priviledges</IT>?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>J.</SPEAKER><P> Yes certainly, though I never so well consider'd them before. But now I plainly see our forefathers had, and we still have <it>all the reason in the world</IT> to be zealous for the mainte&rehy;nance and preservation thereof from subversion or encroach&rehy;ments, and to transmit them <it>intire</IT> to posterity. For if once this <it>bank</IT> be broken down or neglected, an <it>ocean</IT> of oppressi&rehy;on, and the ruins of infinite numbers of people, (as in <it>Empson</IT> and <it>Dudley's</IT> days) may easily follow, when on any pretence they may be made <it>Criminals</IT>, and then fined in vast sums, with pretext to enrich the Kings Coffers, but indeed to feed those insatiate <it>Vultures</IT> that promote such unreasonable Prosecuti&rehy;ons. But since you have taught me so much of the <it>antiquity</IT> and <it>excellency</IT> of Juries, I cannot but crave the continuance of your favour to acquaint me somewhat more particularly of their <it>office</IT> and <it>power</IT> by Law. <NOTE
TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The Office and power of Juries.</NOTE></P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> I shall gladly comply with so reasonable and just a re&rehy;quest. <it>A Jury of twelve men are by our Laws the only proper Judges of the matter in issue before them</IT>. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">See <it>Cook,</IT> 4th part of Instit. <it>fol.</IT> 84.</NOTE> As for instance,</P>
<P>1. That Testimony which is delivered to induce a Jury to believe, or not to believe the matter of Fact in issue, is called in Law EVIDENCE, because thereby the Jury may out of many matters of Fact, <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Evidere veritatem</FOREIGN></IT>, that is, <it>see clearly the truth</IT>, of which they are proper Judges.</P>
<P>2. When any matter is sworn, Deed read, or offered whe&rehy;ther it shall be believed or not, or whether it be <it>true or false</IT> in point of Fact, the Jurors are proper Judges.</P>
<P>3. Whether such an act was done in such or such a manner, or to such or such an <it>intent</IT>, the Jurors are Judges. For the Court is not Judg of these matters, which are evidence to prove or disprove the thing in issue. And therefore the Wit&rehy;nesses are always ordered to <it>direct their speech to the Jury</IT>, they being the proper Judges of their Testimony. And in all Pleas of the Crown (or matters Criminal) the Prisoner is said, <it>to put himself for trial upon his Country</IT>, which is explain<PB
N="9">ed, and referred by the Clerk of the Court, to be meant of the Jury, saying to them, <it>Which Country you are</IT>.</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The office of the Court in Trials.</NOTE> <SP><speaker rend=it>J.</SPEAKER><P> Well then, what is the part of the Kings <it>Justices</IT>, or the Court? what are they to take cognizance of, or do, in the Trials of mens Lives, Liberties, and Properties?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> Their office in general is to do <it>equal justice</IT> and right: particularly,</P>
<P>1. To see that the Jury be regularly <it>return'd</IT> and duly <it>sworn</IT>.</P>
<P>2. To see that the Prisoner (in cases where 'tis permittable) be allowed his lawful <it>challenges</IT>.</P>
<P>3. To advise by Law, whether such matter may be given in evidence or not, such a writing read or not, or such a man admitted to be a witness, <it>&amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>4. Because by their <it>learning</IT> and experience they are pre&rehy;sum'd to be best qualified to ask pertinent questions, and in the most perspicuous manner soonest to sift out truth from amongst the tedious impertinent Circumstances and Tautologies; they therefore commonly <it>examine the Witnesses in the Court</IT>, yet not <it>excluding the Jury</IT>, who of right <it>may</IT>, and where they see cause, <it>ought</IT> to ask them any necessary questions, which undoubtedly they may lawfully do with modesty and discre&rehy;tion, without <it>begging any leave</IT>. For if asking leave be ne&rehy;cessary, it implies in the Court a right when they lift to deny it; and how then shall the Jury know the truth? And since we see that Council, who too often (&horfill; <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Pudet h&aelig;c opprobria nobis</FOREIGN></IT>) for their <it>fees</IT> strive only to baffle Witnesses, and stifle Truth, take upon them daily to <it>interrogate</IT> the evidence, 'tis absurd to think that the Jurors should not have the <it>same priviledg</IT>, who are upon their <it>Oaths</IT>, and <it>proper Judges</IT> of the matter.</P>
<P>5. As a discreet and <it>lawful Assistant</IT> to the Jury, they do often recapitulate and sum up the heads of the Evidence; but the Jurors are still to consider whether it be done <it>truly, fully</IT> and <it>impartially</IT>, (for one mans <it>memory</IT> may sooner fail than <it>Twelve's</IT>.) <NOTE

But since <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Ex facto jus oritur</FOREIGN></IT>, all matter of Law arises out of matter of Fact, so that till the Fact is <it>setled</IT> there is no room for Law, therefore all such <it>discourses</IT> of a Judg to a Jury are or ought to be <it>Hypothetical</IT>, not <it>coercive</IT>; conditional, and not <it>positive</IT>; viz. <it>If you find the fact thus or thus</IT>, (still leaving the Jury at liberty to find as they see cause) <it>then you are to find for the Plaintiff. But if you find the Fact thus or thus, then you are to find for the Defendant</IT>, or the like, <it>Guilty</IT>, or <it>not guilty</IT>, in cases Criminal.</P>
<P>Lastly, They are to <it>take the Verdict</IT> of the Jury, and there&rehy;upon to give <it>judgment</IT> according to Law. For the office of a Judg (as <it>Cook</IT> well observes) is <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">jus dicere</FOREIGN></IT>, not <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">jus dare</FOREIGN></IT>; not to make any Laws by strains of wit, or forced Interpretati&rehy;ons; but plainly and impartially to declare the Law already establisht. Nor can they refuse to accept the Juries Verdict when agreed: For if they should, and force the Jury to re&rehy;turn, and any of them should miscarry for want of &rehy;modation it would undoubtedly be murder; and in such case the Jury may without crime force their liberty, because they are illegally confined, having given in their Verdict, and thereby honestly discharged their office, and are not to be starv'd for any mans pleasure.</P></SP>
<NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">How Jurors are judges of Law as well as Fact.</NOTE> <SP><speaker rend=it>J.</SPEAKER><P> But I have been told, That a Jury is only Judg of na&rehy;ked <it>matter of fact</IT>, and are not at all to take upon them to <it>meddle with</IT>, or regard <it>matter of Law</IT>, but leave it wholly to the Court.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER> <P>'Tis most true, Jurors are <it>Judges</IT> of matters of Fact, that is their <it>proper Province</IT>, their chief business; but yet not <it>ex&rehy;cluding</IT> the consideration of matter of Law, as it <it>arises</IT> out of, or is <it>complicated</IT> with, and <it>influences</IT> the Fact. For to say, they are not at all to meddle with, or have respect to Law in giving their Verdicts, is not only a <it>false</IT> position, and contradicted by every days <it>experience</IT>; but also a very <it>dan&rehy;gerous and pernicious</IT> one, tending to defeat the principal <PB
N="11">end of the Institution of Juries, and so subtilly to <it>undermine</IT> that which was <it>too strong</IT> to be <it>batter'd down</IT>.</P>
<P>1. <it>It is false</IT>: for though the direction as to matter of Law separately may belong to the Judg, and the finding the matter of Fact does peculiarly belong to the Jury, yet must your Jury also <it>apply matter of Fact and Law together</IT>; and from their consideration of, and a right judgment upon both, bring forth their Verdict: For do we not see in most General issues, as upon <it>not guilty</IT>, pleaded in <it>trespass</IT>, breach of the peace, or <it>Felony</IT>, though it be matter <it>in Law</IT> whether the party be a <it>trespasser</IT>, a breaker of the Peace, or a <it>Felon</IT>; yet the Jury do not find the <it>Fact</IT> of the case by it self, lea&rehy;ving the Law to the Court; but find the party <it>guilty</IT>, or not <it>guilty</IT>, generally. So as though they answer not to the question singly, <it>what is Law</IT>; yet they determine the Law in all matters where Issue is join'd. So likewise is it not every days practise, that when persons are Indicted for <it>murther</IT>, the Jury does not only find them <it>guilty</IT> or not <it>guilty</IT>, but many times upon hearing and weighing of circumstances, brings them in, either <it>guilty</IT> of <it>Murther, Manslaughter, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Infortu&rehy;nitus</FOREIGN></IT>, or <it><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">se-defendendo</FOREIGN></IT>, as they see cause. Now do they not herein <it>complicately resolve</IT> both Law and Fact? And to what end is it that when any person is prosecuted upon any <it>Sta&rehy;tute</IT>, the Statute it self is usually read to Jurors, but only that they <it>may judg</IT>. Whether or no the matter be within that Statute? But to put the business out of doubt, we have the <it>suffrage</IT> of that Oracle of Law <it>Littleton</IT>, who in his <it>Tenures, Sect.</IT> 368. declares, <it>That if a Jury will take upon them the knowledg of the law upon the matter, they may</IT>. Which is agreed to, likewise by <it>Cook</IT> in his Comment thereupon. And therefore 'tis <it>false</IT> to say, That the Jury hath not power, or doth not use frequently to apply the Fact to the Law; and thence taking their <it>measures</IT>, judg of, and determine the <it>crime</IT> or <it>issue</IT> by their Verdict.</P>
<PB N="12"><P>2. As Juries have ever been <it>vested</IT> with such <it>power</IT> by Law, so to exclude them from, or <it>disseize</IT> them of the same, were utterly <it>to defeat the end of their institution</IT>. For then if a person should be Indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but clothed and disguised in the Indict&rehy;ment with the name of Treason, or some other high crime, and prov'd by Witnesses to have been done by him; the Jury though satisfied in Conscience, that the Fact is not any such offence as 'tis called, yet because (according to this fond opinion) they have no power to judg of <it>law</IT>, and the <it>fact</IT> charged is fully <it>prov'd</IT>, they should at this rate be bound to find him <it>guilty</IT>. And being so found, the Judg may pronounce sentence against him, for he finds him a convict&rehy;ed Traytor, <it>&amp;c.</IT> by his Peers. And thus as a certain Phy&rehy;sician boasted, That he had <it>kill'd one of his Patients with the best method in the world</IT>; So here should we have an <it>in&rehy;nocent</IT> man hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd, and all <it>according to law</IT>.

And since you seem so dull as not to perceive it, let us put an Imaginary case, not in the least to abet any irre&rehy;verence towards his Majesty, but only to explain the thing, and shew the absurdness of this opinion. &horfill; Suppose then a man should be Indicted, <it>For that he as a false Traytor not having the fear of God before his eyes</IT>, &amp;c. <PB

Being hereupon ar&rehy;raigned, and having pleaded <it>Not guilty</IT>, suppose that suffici&rehy;ent evidence should swear the matter of Fact laid in the In&rehy;dictment, viz. <it>That he did pass by the Statue or Picture with his hat on</IT>; now imagine your self one of the Jury that were sworn to try him, What would you do in the matter?</P></SP>

<SP><speaker rend=it>B.</SPEAKER><P> This but poorly mends the matter, and signifies little or nothing; For such a finding hath generally been <it>refused</IT> by the Court, as being <it>no Verdict</IT>, though 'tis said it was lately allowed somewhere in <it>a Case that required favour</IT>. But sup&rehy;pose it were accepted, what do you intend shall become of the Prisoner? must not he be kept in Prison til all the Judges are at leisure and willing to meet and <it>argue</IT> the business? Ought you not, and what Reason can you give why you should not absolutely acquit and discharge him? Nay, I do aver, you are bound by your Oaths to do it, by saying with your <it>mouths</IT> to the Court, what your <it>Consciences</IT> cannot but di&rehy;ctate to your selves, <it>Not Guilty</IT>: For pray consider, Are you not sworn, <it>That you will well and truly Try, and true deliverance make?</IT> There's none of this Story of <it>matter of Fact</IT>, distinguisht from Law in your Oath. But you are, <it>Well</IT>, That is, <it>Fully</IT> and <it>Truly</IT>, that is <it>Impar<PB N="17[15]">tially</IT>, to try the Prisoner. So that if upon the Consciences, and the best of the <it>Understanding</IT> by what is proved against him, you find he is guilty of that <it>Crime</IT> wherewith he stands charg&rehy;ed, that is, deserving <it>Death</IT>, or such <it>other Punishment</IT> as the Law inflicts upon an Offence so <it>denominated</IT>; then you are to say, he is <it>Guilty</IT>. But if you are not satisfied, that either the <it>Act</IT> he has committed was Treason, or other Crime, (though it be never so often <it>called so</IT>) or that the Act it self, if it were so cri&rehy;minal, was not <it>done</IT>, then what remains but that you are to ac&rehy;quit him? For the end of Juries is to preserve Men from <it>op&rehy;pression</IT>, which may happen as well by <it>imposing</IT> or ruining them for that <it>as a Crime</IT>, which indeed is <it>none</IT>, or at least not such or so <it>great</IT> as is pretended, as by charging them with the Commis&rehy;sion of that which in truth was <it>not committed</IT>. And how do you <it>well and truly Try, and true Deliverance make</IT>, when indeed you do but deliver him up to others to be <it>Condemned</IT>, for that which your selves do not believe to be any <it>Crime</IT>?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> Well; but the <it>supposed Case</IT> is a Case <it>unsupposable</IT>. It is not to be imagined, that any such thing should happen, nor to be thought, that the Judges will condemn any Man, though brought in Guilty by the Jury, if the Matter in it self be not so <it>Criminal</IT> by Law.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> 'Tis most true, I do not believe that ever <it>that Case</IT> will happen. I put it in a thing of apparent <it>Absurdity</IT>, that you might the more clearly observe the unreasonableness of this Do&rehy;ctrine; but withal I must tell you, That 'tis not impossible that some <it>other Cases</IT> may really happen, of the same or the <it>like na&rehy;ture</IT>, though more <it>fine</IT> and plausible. And though we apprehend not, that during the Reign of His Majesty that now is, (<it>whose Life God long preserve</IT>) any Judges will be made that would so <it>wrest the Law</IT>; Yet what Security is there, but that some <it>Suc&rehy;cessors</IT> may not be so cautious in their Choice? And though our <it>Benches</IT> of Judicature be at present furnish'd with Gentle&rehy;men of great Integrity, yet there may one day happen some <it>Tresi&rehy;lian</IT>, or Kinsman of <it>Empsons</IT>, to get in, (for what <it>has been</IT>, may be) who <it>Empson-like</IT>, shall pretend it to be for his Masters <PB

<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> Yet still I have heard, that in every Indictment, or Information, there is always something of <it>Form</IT> or Law, and something else of <it>Fact</IT>; and it seems reasonable, that the Jury should not be bound up <it>nicely</IT> to find <it>every Formality</IT> therein expressed, or else to acquit (perhaps) a notorious Criminal. But if they find the <it>Essential Matter</IT> of the Crime, then they ought to find him Guilty.</P></SP>

<P>But on the other side, when the Matter in Issue in it self, and taken as a naked Proposition, is of such a Nature, as no Action, Indictment, or <it>Information</IT> will lie for it <it>singly</IT>, but it is <it>work'd up</IT> by special Aggravations into Matter of <it>Damage</IT> or <it>Crime</IT>; as that it was done to <it>scandalize the Government</IT>, to <it>raise Sedition</IT>, to <it>affront Authority</IT>, or the like, or with such or such an <it>evil intent</IT>.

<PB N="[21]"><P>As for the <it>Judges</IT> they have a fairer plea than you, and may qickly return the <it>Burthen</IT> back upon the Jurors, for <it>we</IT>, may they say, <it>did nothing but our duty according to usual Pra&rehy;ctise, the Jury his Peers had found the Fellow Guilty upon their Oaths of such an Odious Crime, and attended with such vile, presumptions, and dangerous Circumstances. They are Judges, we took him as they presented him to us, and according to our du&rehy;ty pronounced the Sentence, that the Law inflicts in such Cases, or set a Fine, or ordered Corporal punishment upon him, which was very moderate, Considering the Crime laid in the Indict&rehy;ment or Information, and of which they had so sworn him Guil&rehy;ty; if he were innocent or not so bad as Represented, let his De&rehy;struction lye upon the Jury</IT> &amp;c.

<PB N="25[23]"><P>And whereas you say, that some <it>Juries in our Memory</IT> have been Fined and imprisoned, you may possibly say true, But tis as true that it hath been only in our Memory, for no such thing was practised in Antient times, for so I find it asserted by a late Learned Judge <NOTE

<P>Now that Iuries <it>otherwise</IT>, are in no Case <it>punishable</IT>, nor can (for giving their Verdict according to their Consciences and the best of their Judgment) be Legally <it>Fined</IT> or Impri&rehy;soned by any Iudge on Colour of <it>not going according to their Evidence</IT>, or finding <it>contrary to the directions of the Court</IT>, is a truth both founded on unanswerable <it>Reasons</IT> and Con&rehy;firmed by irrefragable <it>Authorities</IT>.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> Those I would gladly hear.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> They are <it>many</IT>, but some of the most evident are these that follow.</P>
<P>As for Reasons.</P>
<P>1. A Iury ought not to be Fined or Imprisoned, because they do not follow the Iudges directions, for if they do fol&rehy;low his direction, they may yet be Attainted, and to say they gave their Verdict according to his directions is no Barr, but the Iudgment shall be <it>revers'd</IT> and they <it>punisht</IT> for doing that, which if they had not done, they should (by this O&rehy;pinion) have been Fined and Imprisoned by the Iudge, for not doing it. &horfill; Which is <it>Unreasonable</IT>.</P>
<P>2. If they <it>do not follow</IT> his direction, and be therefore <it>Fined</IT>, yet they may be <it>Attainted</IT>, and so they should be <it>doubly</IT> punisht by distinct Iudicatures for the same Offence, which the Common Law never admits.</P>
<P>3. To what end is the Jury to be return'd out of the <it>Vi&rehy;cinage</IT> (that is, <it>the neighbourhood</IT>) whence the issue ariseth? To what end must <it>Hundredors</IT> be of the Jury, whom the Law supposeth to have nearer knowledge of the Fact than those of the Vicinage in general? To what end are they <it>challeng'd</IT> so <PB N="27[25]">scrupulously to the <it>Array</IT> and <it>Pole</IT>? to what end must they have such a certain <it>Freehold</IT>, and be <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Probi & legales homines</FOREIGN></IT>, and not of <it>Affinity</IT> with the Parties concerned? <it>&amp;c.</IT> If after all this they <it>implicitly</IT> must give a Verdict by the Dictates and Authority of another Man, under pain of <it>Fines</IT> and <it>Imprison&rehy;ment</IT>, when sworn to do it according to the best of their <it>own knowledge</IT>; a Man cannot see by anothers Eye, nor hear by <it>anothers Ear</IT>, no more can a Man conclude or <it>infer</IT> the thing to be resolved by <it>anothers</IT> understanding or reasoning, unless all Mens understandings were equally alike; and if meerly in compliance because the Iudge <it>says thus or thus</IT>, a Iury shall give a Verdict, though such their Verdict should happen to be <it>right</IT>, true, and just, yet they being not assured <it>it is so</IT> from their own understanding, are <it>forsworn</IT>, at least in <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Foro Con&rehy;scienti&aelig;</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>4. Were Jurors so finable, then every Major and Bailiff of Corporations, all Stewards of Leets, Justices of Peace, <it>&amp;c.</IT> whatever Matters are try'd before them, shall have <it>Verdicts to their minds</IT>, or else Fine and Imprison the Jurors till they <it>have</IT>; so that such must be either pleased, humored, or grati&rehy;fied, else no Justice or Right to be had in any Court.</P>
<P>5. Whereas a Person by Law may <it>Challenge</IT> the Sheriff or any Jury-man, if of Kin to his Adversary, yet he cannot chal&rehy;lenge a Major, Recorder, Justice, <it>&amp;c.</IT> who 'tis possible will have a Verdict for their <it>Kinsman</IT>, or against their <it>Enemy</IT>, or else Fine and Imprison the Jury till they have obtained it; so that by this means our Lives, Liberties, and Properties shall be solely tryed by, and remain at the Arbitrary dispose of eve&rehy;ry mercenary or corrupted <it>Justice</IT>, Major, Bailiff, or Recor&rehy;der, if any such should at any time get into <it>Office</IT>.</P>
<P>6. 'Tis unreasonable that a Jury should be Finable on pre&rehy;tence of their going <it>against their Evidence</IT>, because it can ne&rehy;ver be <it>Tryed</IT> whether or no in truth they did find with or a&rehy;gainst their Evidence, by reason no <it>Writ of Error</IT> lies in the Case.</P>
<P>7. Were Jury-men liable to such Arbitrary Fines, they should be in a <it>worse condition</IT> than the Criminals that are tryed <PB N="28[26]">by them; for in all Civil Actions, Informations, and Indict&rehy;ments, some Appeals, or Writs of false Judgment, or of Er&rehy;ror, do lie into <it>Superior Courts</IT> to try the regular Proceedings of the Inferior. But there can be no After-Tryal or Examina&rehy;tion, but the Jury-man (if Fining at all were <it>lawful</IT>) must either pay the Fine, or lie by it, <it>without remedy</IT>, to decide whether in his particular Case he were legally Fined or not.</P>
<P>8. Without a Fact agreed, it is as impossible for a Judge or any other to <it>know the Law</IT>, relating to that Fact, or <it>direct</IT> con&rehy;cerning it, as to know an Accident that hath no Subject; for as where there is <it>no Law, there is no Transgression</IT>, so where there is <it>no Transgression, there is no place for Law</IT>; for <it>the Law</IT> (saith Divine Authority) <it>is made for the Transgressor</IT>. And as <it>Cook</IT> tells us, <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Ex facto Jus oritur</FOREIGN></IT>, upon stating the Fact or Trans&rehy;gression matter of Law doth arise, or grow out of the Root of the Fact. Now the Jury being the <it>sole Judges of Fact, and Matter in Issue</IT> before them, not finding the Fact on which the Law should arise, cannot be said to find <it>against Law</IT>, which is no other than a Superstructure on Fact; so that so say they have found against the Law, when <it>no Fact</IT> is found, is absurd; an expression insignificant and unintelligible; for no <it>Issue</IT> can be joyned of matter in Law, no <it>Jury</IT> can be <it>Charged</IT> with the Tryal of matter in Law barely, no <it>Evidence</IT> ever was, or can be given to a Jury of what is Law, or not. Nor can any such Oath be given to, or taken by a Jury to try matter in Law, nor does an Attaint for such Oath, if false, <it>&amp;c.</IT> But if <it>by find&rehy;ing against the Direction of the Court in matter of Law</IT>, shall be understood, that if the Judge having heard the Evidence given in Court, (for he can regularly know no other, though the Jury may) shall tell the Jury upon this Evidence, <it>the Law is for the Plaintiff, or the Defendant</IT>, and the Jury are under <it>pain</IT> of Fine and Imprisonment to <it>Find</IT> accordingly; then 'tis plain the Jury ought <it>of Duty</IT> so to do. Now if this were <it>true</IT>, who sees not that the Iury is but a troublesome <it>Delay</IT>, of great <it>Charge</IT>, much <it>Formality</IT>, and no real <it>use</IT>, in determining right and wrong, but meer <it>Ecchos</IT> to sound back the pleasure of the <PB
N="29[27]">Court; and consequently that Tryals by them might be better <it>abolish'd</IT> than continued? which is at once to spit Folly in the Faces of our Venerable Ancestors, and enslave our Posterity.</P>
<P>9. As the Iudge can <it>never direct what the Law is</IT> in any Mat&rehy;ter Controverted, without <it>first knowing the Fact</IT>, so he can&rehy;not possibly know the Fact but from the <it>Evidence</IT> which the Iury have; but he can never <it>fully</IT> know what Evidence they have, for besides what is sworn in Court, (which is all that the Judge can know) the Jury being of the <it>Neighbourhood</IT>, may, and oft-times <it>do know</IT> something of their own knowledge, as to the Matter it self, the Credit of the Evidence, <it>&</IT>c which may justly <it>sway</IT> them in delivering their Verdict, and which self knowledge of theirs is so far <it>countenanced</IT> by Law, that it supposes them capable thereby to <it>try</IT> the Matter in Issue, (and so they must) though <it>no Evidence</IT> were given on either side in Court. As when any Man is Indicted, and no Evidence comes against him, the Direction of the Court always is, <it>You are to acquit him, unless of your own knowledge you know him Guilty</IT>; so that even in that Case they may find him Guilty without any Witnesses. Now, how absurd is it to think, that any Iudge has power to <it>Fine</IT> a Iury for going against their E&rehy;vidence, when he that so Fineth knoweth perhaps nothing of their <it>Evidence</IT> at all, (as in the last Case) or at least but some <it>part</IT> of it? For how is it possible he should lawfully punish them for that which it is impossible for him to know.</P>
<P>Lastly, Is any thing more common, than for two Lawyers or Iudges to deduce <it>contrary</IT> and opposite Conclusions out of the <it>same Case</IT> in Law? And why then may not two Men infer distinct Conclusions from the same <it>Testimony</IT>? And consequent&rehy;ly may not the <it>Judge</IT> and <it>Jury</IT> honestly differ in their Opinion or Result from the Evidence, as well as two Iudges may, which often happens; and shall the <it>Jury-men</IT> meerly for this diffe&rehy;rence of Apprehension merit Fine and Imprisonment, because they do that which they cannot otherwise do, preserving their <it>Oath</IT> and <it>Integrity</IT>? especially when by Law they are presum'd to know <it>better</IT> and much <it>more</IT> of the Business, than the Judge does as aforesaid.</P>
<PB N="30[28]"><P>Are not all these gross contradicting Absurdities? and un&rehy;worthy (by any Man that deserves <it>a Gown</IT>) to be put upon the <it>Law of England</IT>, which has ever own'd <it>Right Reason</IT> for its Parent, and dutifully submitted to be <it>guided</IT> thereby?
</P></SP><SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> If the <it>Law</IT>, as you say, be <it>Reason</IT>, then undoubt&rehy;edly this Practice of <it>Fining of Juries</IT> is most <it>Illegal</IT>, since there cannot be any thing more <it>unreasonable</IT>; But what <it>Authorities</IT> have you against it?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER> <P>You have heard it proved to be a <it>Modern</IT> up-start en&rehy;croachment, so you cannot expect any direct or express Con&rehy;demnation of it in Ancient Times, because the thing was not then <it>set on Foot</IT>. And by the way, though <it>Negative Arguments</IT> are not necessarily conclusive, yet that we meet with no <it>Prece&rehy;dents</IT> of old of Iuries Fined, for giving their Verdict contrary to Evidence, or the Sense of the Court, is a violent presump&rehy;tion, that it ought not to be done; for it cannot be supposed, that this latter Age did <it>first of all discover</IT>, that Verdicts were many times not according to the Iudges Opinion and <it>Liking</IT>. Undoubtedly they saw <it>that</IT> as well as we; but knowing the same not to be any Crime, or <it>punishable</IT> by Law, were so <it>Mo&rehy;dest</IT> and <it>Honest</IT> as not to meddle with it. However, what en&rehy;tertainment it hath met with when attempted in <it>our Times</IT>, I shall shew you in two remarkable Cases.</P>
<P>1. When the late Lord Chief Iustice <it>Keeling</IT> had attempted something of that kind, it was complained of, and highly re&rehy;sented by the then <it>Parliament</IT>; as appears by this Copy of their <it>Proceedings</IT> thereupon taken out of their <it>Journal</IT>, as follows.</P>

<P><Q>First, That the Proceedings of the said Lord Chief Iustice in the Cases now Reported are <it>Innovations</IT> in the Tryal of Men for their Lives and Liberties. And that he hath used <PB

<P><Q>Secondly, That in the Place of Iudicature the Lord Chief Iu&rehy;stice hath undervalued, vilified, & contemned <GO>Magna Charta</GO>, the great <GO>Preserver</GO> of our Lives, Freedom, and Property.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thirdly, That he be brought to <it>Tryal</IT> in order to condign <it>Punishment</IT>, in such manner as the House shall judge most fit and requisite.</Q></P>

</P><P>The Court coming to debate the <it>validity</IT> of this <it>Retorn</IT>, ad&rehy;judged them same <it>insufficient</IT>; for 1. The Words, &horfill; <it>Against full and manifest Evidence</IT>, was too general a Cause; the Evi&rehy;dence should have been <it>fully</IT> and particularly recited, else how shall the Court know it was <it>so full and evident</IT>; they have now only the Iudgment of the <it>Sessions</IT> for it, that it was so; but, said the Iudges, <it>Our Judgment ought to be Grounded upon our own Inferences and Understandings, and not upon theirs</IT>.</P>
<P>2.

<P>3.

<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> This <it>Resolution</IT> hath, one would think (as you said) <it>knock'd this</IT> Illegal Practice on the Head, beyond any possibility of <it>Revival</IT>, but may it not one day be <it>denied</IT> to be Law, and the contrary <it>justified</IT>?</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barr.</SPEAKER><P> No such thing can be done without apparent <it>violating</IT> and subverting all <it>Law, Justice</IT> and <it>Modesty</IT>; for though the <it>Precedent</IT> it self be valuable, and without further inquiry is wont to be allowed, when given thus <it>deliberately</IT> upon solemn debate by the whole Court; yet 'tis not only <it>that</IT>, but the sound substantial and everlasting <it>Reasons</IT>, whereon they grounded such their Resolves, that will at all times <it>Justify</IT> Fining of Iuries in such Cases to be <it>Illegal</IT>; besides, as the <it>Reporter</IT> was most con&rehy;siderable, both in his <it>Quality</IT> as Lord <it>Chief Justice</IT>, and for his Parts, soundness of Iudgment, and deep Learning in the <it>Law</IT>; so such his Book of Reports is <it>approved</IT> and recommended to the World, (as appears by the Page next after the Epistle) by the Right Honourable the present Lord Chancellor of <it>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, Sir <it>William Scroggs</IT>, now Lord Chief Iustice of <it>England</IT>, my Lord <it>North</IT>, Chief Iustice of the <it>Common-Pleas</IT>; and in a word, by all the Iudges of <it>England</IT> at the time of Publishing thereof; so that it cannot be imagined how any Book can challenge greater Authority, unless we should expect it to be particularly confirm'd by Act of Parliament.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Jurym.</SPEAKER><P> You have answered all my <it>Scruples</IT>, and since I see <PB N="35[33]">the Law has made so good <it>Provision</IT> for Jury-mens priviledges and safety, God forbid any Jury-man should be of so <it>base</IT> a temper, as to betray that (otherwise) impregnable <it>Fortress</IT> wherein the Law hath plac'd him, to preserve and defend the just Rights and Liberties of his Country, by treacherously surrendering the same into the hands of <it>Violence</IT> or <it>Oppressi&rehy;on</IT>, though maskt under never so fair Stratagems and Pre&rehy;tences; for my own part, I shall not now decline to appear according to my Summons, and therefore (though I fear I have detained you <it>too long</IT> already) shall desire a little more of your direction about the <it>Office</IT> of a Jury-man, in particu&rehy;lar that I may uprightly and <it>honestly</IT> discharge the same.</P></SP>
<SP><speaker rend=it>Barrist.</SPEAKER><P> Though I think from what we have discours'd be&rehy;ing <it>digested</IT> and improv'd by your own Reason, you may suf&rehy;ficiently Inform your self, yet to gratifie your request, I shall add a few brief <it>Remarques</IT>, as well of what you ought cauti&rehy;ously to <it>avoid</IT>, as what you must diligently <it>pursue</IT> and regard if you would justly and truly do your duty.</P>
<P><it>First</IT>, as to what you must avoid.</P>
<P>1. I am very Confident, that you would not willingly vi&rehy;olate <it>the Oath</IT> which you take, but 'tis possible that <it>there are such</IT> who as frequently <it>break</IT> them, as <it>take</IT> them, through their <it>careless custome</IT> on the one hand, or <it>slavish fear</IT> on the other, against which I would fully caution you; that you may <it>defend</IT> your self and others, against any Enemies of your Countreys Liberties and happiness, and keep a good Conscience towards God and towards man.</P>
<P>2, 'Tis frequent, that when Juries are withdrawn that they may consult of their <it>Verdict</IT>, they soon forget that Solemn Oath they took, and that <it>mighty Charge</IT> of the Life and Liberty of men, and their Estates, whereof then they are made <it>Judges</IT>, and on <it>their Breath</IT> not only the <it>Fortunes</IT> of the particular Party, but perhaps the preservation or <it>Ruin</IT> of several Numerous Fa&rehy;milies does Solely depend, now I say without due Conside&rehy;ration of all this, nay sometimes without <it>one serious thought</IT>, or Consulted Reason offered <it>Pro</IT>, or <it>Con</IT>, presently the <it>Fore&rehy; <PB N="36[34]">man</IT> or one or two that call themselves <it>Antient</IT> Jury-men (though in truth they never <it>knew</IT> what belongs to the place more than a common <it>School-Boy</IT>) rashly deliver their <it>Opinions</IT> and <it>all the rest</IT> in respect to their supposed <it>Gravity</IT> and <it>Expe&rehy;rience</IT>, or because they have the biggest <it>Estates</IT>, or to avoid the trouble of <it>disputing</IT> the Point, or to prevent the spoiling of <it>Dinner</IT> by delay, or some such <it>weighty</IT> Reason, forthwith a&rehy;gree <it>blind fold</IT>, or else go to holding up of hands or telling of <it>Noses</IT>, and so the <it>Major Vote</IT> carries away <it>Captive</IT> both the <it>Reason</IT> and <it>Consciences</IT> of the rest. Thus trifling with <it>Sacred Oaths</IT>, and putting mens Lives, Liberties and Proper&rehy;ties (as it were) to the hap-hazard of <it>Cross</IT> or <it>Pile</IT>; This Practise or something of the like kind, is said to be <it>too Custo&rehy;mary</IT> amongst some Jurors, which occasions such their extraordinary <it>dispatch</IT> of the weightiest or most Intricate matters, but there will come a time when they shall be called to a severe Account for their <it>Hast</IT> and <it>Negligence</IT>, therefore have a care of such <it>Fellow-Jurors</IT>.</P>
<P>3. Such a <it>Slavish Fear</IT> attends many Jurors, that let the Court but direct to find <it>Guilty</IT>, or <it>not Guilty</IT>, though they themselves see no just Reason for it, yea oft-times though their own Opinions are contrary, and their Consciences tell them it ought to go <it>otherwise</IT>; yet, right or wrong accordingly they will bring in their Verdict; and therefore many of them never regard seriously the <it>course</IT> and force of the Evidence, what and how it was delivered more or less to prove the In&rehy;dictment, <it>&amp;c.</IT> But <it>as the Court Sums it up</IT>, they find; as if Juries were appointed for no other purpose but to <it>Eccho</IT> back, what the Bench would have done; such a base temper is to be avoided, as you would escape being <it>Forsworn</IT>, even though your Verdict should be right; for since you do not know it so to be by your own Judgment or Understanding, you have <it>abused your Oath</IT> and hazarded your own <it>Soul</IT> as well as your Neighbours <it>Life</IT> Liberty or Property, because you <it>blindly</IT> depend on the opinion or perhaps <it>passion</IT> of others, when you were Sworn well and truly to try them <it>your selves</IT>. Such an <PB N="37[35]"><it>implicite Faith</IT> is near of Kin to that of <it>Rome</IT> in Religion, and (at least in the next degree) as <it>dangerous</IT>.</P>
<P>4. There are some that make <it>a Trade</IT> of being Jury-men that <it>seek</IT> for the Office, use means to be constantly <it>continued</IT> in it, will not give <it>a disobliging</IT> Verdict lest they should be <it>discharg'd</IT> and serve no more, these <it>standing Jurors</IT> have cer&rehy;tainly some ill game to play, there are others that hope to <it>Signalize</IT> themselves to get a better Trade, or some <it>Prefer&rehy;ment</IT> by <it>serving a Turn</IT>; there are others that have particu&rehy;lar <it>Piques</IT> and a humor of Revenge against such or such <it>Par&rehy;ties</IT>, if a man be but <it>miscall'd</IT> by some Odious name, or said to be of an exploded Faction &horfill; streight they cry <it>hang him, Find him Guilty</IT>, no punishment can be too bad for such <it>a Fellow</IT>, in such a case they think it merit to <it>Stretch</IT> an Evi&rehy;dence on the tenter-hooks, and <it>strain</IT> a Point of Law because they fancy it makes for the Interest of the Government. As if <it>Injustice</IT> or <it>Oppression</IT> could in any case be for the true In&rehy;terest of Government when in truth nothing more <it>weakens</IT> or <it>destroys</IT> it, but this was an <it>old stratagem</IT>, if thou <it>suffer this man to escape, thou shalt not be C&aelig;sars Friend</IT>. When C&aelig;sar was so far from either <it>needing</IT> or <it>thanking</IT> them for any such base Services, that had he but truly understood them, he would severely have punisht their <it>Partiality</IT> and Tyranny.</P>
<P>All these and the like <it>pestilent Biases</IT> are to be avoided and abominated by every honest Jury-man.</P>
<P>But now as to the positive Qualifications requisite.</P>
<P>1. You that are Jury-men should first of all seriously re&rehy;gard the weight and importance of the Office; your own Souls other mens Lives, Liberties, Estates, all that in this World are dear to them, are at Stake, and in your hands; therefore consider things well before-hand, and come substantially fur&rehy;nished and provided with sound and well-grounded Conscien&rehy;ces, with clear minds, free from malice, fear, hope, or favour; lest instead of <it>Judging</IT> others, thou shouldest work thy own Condemnation, and stand in the sight of God our Creator and Judge of all men, no better than a <it>Murtherer</IT>, or <it>Perjur&rehy;ed</IT> Malefactor.</P>
<PB N="38[36]"><P>2. Observe well the Record, Indictment or Information that is read, and the several parts thereof, both as to the mat&rehy;ter, manner, and form.
</P><P>3. Take due notice and regard to the Evidence offered for Proof of the Indictment, and each part of it, as well to man&rehy;ner and form as matter; and if you suspect any Subornation, foul Practise, or tampering hath been with the witnesses, or that they have any malice or sinister design, have a special regard to the Circumstances or Incoherencies of their Tales, and endeavour by apt Questions to sift out the truth, or dis&rehy;cover the Villainy. And for your better satisfaction endeavour to write down the evidence or the Heads thereof that you may the better Recall it to memory.</P>
<P>4. Take notice of the nature of the Crime charged, and what Law the Prosecution is grounded upon, and distinguish the supposed Criminal Fact which is proved, from the aggra&rehy;vating Circumstances which are not proved.</P>
<P>5. Remember that in Juries there is no Plurality of Voices to be allowed; 7 cannot over-rule or by vertue of Majority Conclude 5. no, nor 11, 1. But as the Verdict is given in the name of all the 12, or else it is void: So every one of them must be actually agreeing, and satisfied in his par&rehy;ticular Understanding and Conscience, of the truth and Righ&rehy;teousness of such Verdict, or else he is forsworn; and there&rehy;fore if one man differ in Opinion from his fellows, they must be kept together, till either they by strength of Reason or Argument can satisfy him, or he convince them. For he is not to be Hecktor'd, much less punisht by the Court into a Compliance; for as the L. Ch. Justice <it>Vaughan</IT> says well, <q rend=it>if a man differ in Judgment from his Fellows whereby they are kept a day and a night, though his dissent may not in truth be as reasonable as the Opinion of the rest that agree, yet if his Judgment be not satisfied, one disagreeing can be no more Cri&rehy;minal than four or five disagreeing with the rest.</Q> <NOTE

<P>6, Endeavour as much as your Circumstances will permit at your spare Hours to Read and Understand the Fundamental Laws of the Country; such as <it>Magna Charta</IT>, the Petition of Right, the late excellent Act for <it>Habeas Corpus's, Horns Mirrour of Justices</IT>, Sir <it>Edw. Cook</IT> in his 2<it>d</IT> 3<it>d</IT> and 4<it>th</IT> parts of the Institutes of the Law of <it>England</IT>, and Judge <it>Vaughans</IT> Reports, these are Books frequent to be had, and of excellent use to in&rehy;form any Reader of Competent Apprehension, of the true Liberties and Priviledges which every <it>English</IT> man is Justly Intituled unto, and Estated in by his Birth-right, as also the nature of Crimes and the punishments severally and respectively Inflicted on them by Law, the Office and du&rehy;ties of Judges, Juries, and all Officers and Ministers of Justice, <it>&amp;c.</IT> Which are highly necessary for every Jury-man in some Competent measure to know, for the Law of <it>England</IT> hath not placed Tryals by Juries to stand between men and Death or Destruction to so little purpose as to Pronounce men <it>Guilty</IT>, without regard to the nature of the Offence, or to what is to be Inflicted thereupon.</P>
<P>For want of truly understanding and considering these things, Juries many times plunge themselves into lamentable perplexities; as it befel the Jury who were the Tryers of Mr. <it>Udal</IT> a Minister, who in the 32<it>d</IT> year of Q. <it>Eliz.</IT> was Indicted and Arraigned at <it>Croydon</IT> in <it>Surry</IT>, for High&rehy;Treason, for defaming the Queen and Her Government in a certain Book Intituled, <it>A Demonstration of the Discipline</IT>, &amp;c. And though there was no Direct, but a scambling Shadow of Proof, and though the Book duly con&rehy;sidered contained no matter of Treason, but certain words which by a forced construction were laid to tend to the defamation of the Govern&rehy;ment, and so the thing prosecuted under that Name; yet the Jury not thinking that in pronouncing him Guilty, they had upon their Oath pro&rehy;nounced him Guilty of Treason, and to die as a Traitor; but supposing that they had only declared him <it>Guilty</IT> of making the Book, hereupon they brought him in <it>Guilty</IT>, but when after the Judges Sentence of Death a&rehy;gainst him (which they never in the least intended) they found what they had done, they were confounded in themselves, and would have done any <PB
N="40[38]">thing in the world to have Revok'd that unwary pernicious Verdict, when, alas! it was too late. Dr. <it>Fuller</IT> has this witty note on this witty Gen&rehy;tlemans Conviction, that is was Conceived <it>rigorous</IT> in the <it>greatest</IT>, which at best (saith he) is <it>Cruel</IT> in the <it>least</IT> Degree. And it seems so Queen <it>Elizabeth</IT> thought it, for she suspended Execution, and he dyed natural&rehy;ly. But his Story survives to warn all Succeeding Jury-men to endea&rehy;vour better to understand what it is they do, and what the Consequences thereof will be.</P>
<P>7. As there is nothing I have said intended to encourage you to partiali&rehy;ty, or tempt any Jury-man to a Connivance at Sin and Malefactors, whereby those Pests of Society should avoid being brought to condign punish&rehy;ment, and so the Law cease to be a terror to evil-doers; which were in him an horrible Perjury, and indeed a foolish Pitty, or <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Crudelis misericordia</FOREIGN></IT>, a Cruel Mercy; for he is highly injurious to the Good that absolves the Bad, when real Crimes are proved against them; so that I must take leave to say, That in Cases where the matter is dubious, both Lawyers and Di&rehy;vines prescribe rather favour than rigour; an eminent and learned Judge <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin"><it>Fortescue, ca.</IT> 27.</NOTE> of our own has in this Advice and Wish gone before me, <it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Mallem rever&agrave; viginti Facinorosos mortem pietate evadere, quam justum unum injuste condem&rehy;nari.</FOREIGN> I verily</IT> (saith he) <it>had rather twenty evil-doers should escape death through Tenderness or Pitty, than that one Innocent Man should be unjustly con&rehy;demned</IT>.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with that excellent Advice of my Lord <it>Cook</IT>, <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">In the Epilogue of his 4<it>th</IT> Part of <it>Institutes</IT>.</NOTE> which he generally addresses to all Judges, but may no less properly be applyed to Jurors. &horfill;</P>
<P>Fear not to do Right to all, and to deliver your [Verdicts] justly accord&rehy;ing to the Laws; for Fear is nothing but a betraying of the Succours that Reason should afford; and if you shall sincerely execute Justice, be assured of three Things.</P>
<P>1. Though some may malign you, yet God will give you his Blessing.</P>
<P>2. That though thereby you may offend Great Men and Favourites, yet you shall have the favourable Kindness of the Almighty, and be his Fa&rehy;vourites.</P>
<P>And lastly, That in so doing, against all scandalous Complaints and pragmatical Devices against you, God will defend you as with a Shield.</P>
