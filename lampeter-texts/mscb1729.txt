<HEAD>THE <BO>LIFE</BO> OF Mr. <IT>James Spiller</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HE transmitting to Posterity the Lives of Persons who have ren&rehy;der'd themselves, in any Manner, or Science, whatsoever, ornamental to a Commonwealth, is a Work that is not only due to deceased Merit, but redounds to the Ho&rehy;nour of the Person who undertakes and executes it with Truth and Ability. On this Account, <IT>Plutarch</IT> still lives, and participates the Re&rehy;nown of those illustrious Persons, whom his victorious Pen has rescued from the Triumphs of the Grave. The Present Age is acquainted with, and admires alike <IT>Suetonius</IT>, and the <IT>Twelve C&aelig;sars</IT>; And the <IT>British Heroes</IT> of the ROAD communicate a Share of their own <PB
N="6">Glory to <IT>Captain Alexander Smith</IT>, the learned <IT>Preserver</IT> of their Exploits and immortal Fame.
</P><P>Under the Encouragement of such notable Examples, I have ventur'd on the following Piece of <IT>Biography</IT>, and flatter myself, that as the <IT>Hero</IT> of my Discourse was a Person of im&rehy;portant Consideration in <IT>Great Britain</IT>, I shall derive to myself no small Portion of his Merits and universal Applause, by the honest and pi&rehy;ous Regard which I have shewn to his Me&rehy;mory.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>James Spiller</IT> was born in the Year of our Lord 1692, of honest and reputable Pa&rehy;rents. His Father was indeed no better than the <IT>Gloucester</IT> Carrier; but having scraped a pretty handsome Sum of Money together, by his own Industry, and having but this one Son, he was resolved to breed him a Gentleman, if Persons may be allowed to be such, who prac&rehy;tice the Liberal Arts, and if Painting may be accounted one among them: He accordingly put him Apprentice to Mr. <IT>Ross</IT> a Landskip Painter, in whose Business, having always a very lively Genius, he grew a tolerable Profici&rehy;ent in a short Time; but a sedentary Life being, by no Means, agreeable to his natural Gayety and Vivacity of Temper, he betook himself very young to one more suitable to his Inclinations, tho' not altogether so genteel or profitable, and went with a Company of Strol<PB
N="7">ling Players, into several Parts of <IT>England</IT>: and so well qualified was he for this Employ&rehy;ment, that into whatever Place he came, or in whatever Play he acted, he was, at all Times, the Life of the Performance, and the greatest Support of the <IT>Company</IT>; but although he pleased his own Humour by this Way of Li&rehy;ving, yet it was so much against the Will of his Father, that he was hardly ever prevail'd upon to do any thing for him afterwards. So difficult a Task it is for young Men to curb their headstrong Desires, tho' check'd by the strongest Ties of Duty and Interest!</P>
<P>The Parts he usually appear'd in, were those of low Comedy, not, but that sometimes, in the Country, where Heroes are not very plen&rehy;tiful, he has represented <IT>Alexander</IT> the Great, <IT>Mithridates</IT> King of <IT>Pontus</IT>, although it must needs be confessed, excellent as he was in his own Way, these Parts were but burlesqu'd by him; but when he came upon the Stage for <IT>Hob</IT> in the <IT>Country Wake</IT>, the Widow <IT>Lackit's</IT> foolish Son, <IT>Daniel</IT> in <IT>Oroonoko, Costar Pairmain</IT> in the <IT>Recruiting Officer</IT>, and many others of the like Sort: His Looks, his most significant Shrugs and Gestures, would oftentimes set the whole Audience a laughing before he had spoke one Word.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding by the Liberality of several Persons of Condition to Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, who were <PB
N="8">willing to encourage One, who had so much Merit in his Profession, he was set above the Necessity of the Rest of his strolling Com&rehy;panions; yet he was often-times pretty much in Arrear, especially at the Tap; (for Mirth is sometimes thirsty as well as Grief) and meeting at a certain Place, (I think it was at <IT>Stamford</IT> in <IT>Lincolnshire</IT>) with a Landlord, who had no great Share of Faith, he was suddenly seized by two Bailiffs, one Eve&rehy;ning, for Three Pounds, Eleven Shillings, just as he was going upon the Stage. He begg'd he might perform his Part, and when that was over, he would go with them where&rehy;ever they pleas'd. They told him they did not care to part with him now they had got him. No more you need, replied he, For you shall both go upon the Stage, and act a Part with me, if you please, that you may be sure I will not go out of your Sight. How can that be? said the Bailiffs, We don't know how to act or speak before so many People. O! answer'd the other, Here are two Parts in this Play, wherein there is Nothing to do or say. In short, he was to act, that Night, the Country Squire in the Comedy called <IT>&AElig;sop</IT>; and he prevailed with the Bailiffs to lead in his two Hounds for him; and finding an Opportunity to get to that Side of the Stage which was near a Door into the Street, he got clear off, and <PB
N="9">when he was quite out of Danger, could not help laughing to think how he had given each of the Bayliffs <IT>a Dog to hold</IT>.</P>
<P>It was not long e'er the Master of the Com&rehy;pany found the Want of him, by the Receipt of his House, and took all the Ways he could think of to recover him, but all to no Purpose, for he was soon got into another very distant Part of the Kingdom, and in the Year 
<GAP DESC="empty space" EXTENT="ca. 7 chars"> came up to <IT>London</IT>, and was receiv'd into the Play-house in <IT>Drury-Lane</IT>, which was, at that Time, under the Management of that great Genius, <IT>Aaron Hill</IT> Esq; and one Mr. <IT>Collier</IT>, a learned Attorney at Law; some of the princi&rehy;pal Actors being then at the <IT>Hay-Market</IT>, but there was left a very good Company at the Old House, among which were Mr. <IT>George Powell</IT>, Mr. <IT>Booth</IT>, Miss <IT>Santlow</IT>, Mr. <IT>Bullock</IT>, Mr. <IT>Norris</IT>, Mr. <IT>Pack</IT>, nor was Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, the Subject of our present Discourse, the most de&rehy;spicable among them. He was well receiv'd at his first Appearance, and every Day gain'd on the good Opinion of the Town. The first Part for which he was very much taken No&rehy;tice of, was that of <IT>Corporal Cuttum</IT> in the <IT>Wal&rehy;king Statue</IT>, written by the abovesaid Mr. <IT>Hill</IT>. It would be an Injustice to that illustrious Poet, if we were not to take Notice of the grateful Sense Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> always expressed of the Fa&rehy;vours he had received from him, in so much <PB
N="10">that when he has happened to be mentioned in his Company, he would even grow wan&rehy;ton in his Praise. It is to the fostering Kindness of this worthy Gentleman that the Town is indebted for some of its greatest Geniusses! Such is that Ph&oelig;nix in her Way, Mrs. <IT>Eliza Haywood</IT>; the most inimitable Mr. <IT>Rich&rehy;ard Savage</IT>; and that sweet Bud of Poetry, who was out off in the Spring of his Life, Mr. <IT>Thomas Patterson</IT>. It is Spirits like these that adorn the Age and Country they live in, and who, as that ingenious Lady, the Author of Mr. <IT>Savage's</IT> Life says, have something in the Force and Sprightliness of their own Ima&rehy;ginations, which more than makes amends for their Ignorance of the Classics; for what was <IT>Sapho</IT> if compared to the first, or <IT>Homer</IT> and <IT>Virgil</IT> to the latter!</P>
<P>But to resume the Thread of our Discourse: the two Companies in the <IT>Hay-Market</IT> and <IT>Drury-Lane</IT> being again united, the Managers thought fit to dismiss Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, who, as they would have it, could act no Parts but such as were in Mr. <IT>Pinkethman's</IT> Way; and they had always received too much Profit from <IT>Pinkey's</IT> Phiz, to encourage any Body to put <IT>that</IT> out of Countenance.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> forced again to return to the Strolling-Trade, made himself as happy as possible, and the more so, by marrying Mrs. <PB
N="11"><IT>Elizabeth Thompson</IT>, a good pretty Woman, and one who might have made a tolerable Figure on the Stage, was it not for a little too much Affectation; but it is the Misfor&rehy;tune of a great many fine Women as well as she, when Nature has made them perfectly agreeable, to marr <IT>her</IT> Handywork, and make themselves the Reverse, by their own Distor&rehy;tions of Body and Features.</P>
<P>The Desire of several Persons to have Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> on the Stage again, who had seen him there before, and the Report that was made of his excellent Performance in the Country, made the Managers of both Houses, (for now <IT>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</IT> Theatre was opened) send pressing Invitations for him to come to <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT>; and indeed it must be own'd he had partly made an Agreement with the Master of the New House to come to him, notwith&rehy;standing he went for a short Time to <IT>Drury&rehy;Lane</IT>; but when the first, as he is himself a most religious Observer of his own Word, sent a Friend to him to put him in mind of his Promise, he went away that Instant, although he was already dress'd for his Part in the <IT>Emperor of the Moon</IT>. His Wife came with him hither, but I cannot learn that she was very remarkable for any Thing but speak&rehy;ing in Men's Cloaths a Prologue to that incom&rehy;parable Tragedy call'd <IT>Mangora, King of the Tim<PB
N="12">busians</IT>, a Play, of which no Part of the Town were capable of tasting the Beauties; nay, some ill judging Criticks have ventured to say, that it abounded with Faults, tho' I think there have been no printed Remarks upon the Plot, the Manners, the Sentiments, and Diction of it; No, no, they knew it would be a hard Task to go so far as that: But however they went far enough to provoke the Honourable Author to write a Defence of his Play, which he set forth in that facetious Pamphlet, entituled the <IT>Mus Muzzled</IT>, which, egad, did their Busi&rehy;ness for them, and smote them all Hip and Thigh. This <IT>Mus Muzzled</IT>, was to be found on every Bulk and Stall in Town, and was not dispersed in such a clancular Manner as the New Edition of the <IT>Dunciad</IT>: But why should we wonder at any Thing done by a Person, who makes no Bones of the brightest Men of the Age, by one, who can attempt to render contemptible such an amiable Cha&rehy;racter as that of Mr. <IT>Edward Ward</IT>, when all the World must own his Hudibrastic Verse has put Mr. <IT>Butler</IT> as much out of Counte&rehy;nance, as Mr. <IT>Charles Johnson's</IT> and Mr. <IT>Oding&rehy;sell's</IT> Comedies have eclipsed the Names of <IT>Congreve</IT> and <IT>Wycherly</IT>. Nay, the very <IT>Lau&rehy;reat</IT> himself cannot escape him, tho' I would fain know on which of his Predecessors Mr. <IT>Eusden</IT> thinks that Title was more deservedly <PB
N="13">bestowed than on himself, notwithstanding <IT>Spencer, Ben Johnson</IT>, and <IT>Dryden</IT> were of the Number. Nor is even the Grave a Shel&rehy;ter, or Shield from the Edge of this Gentle&rehy;man's Satyr, but poor Mr. <IT>Durfey</IT> is raised again from the Dead to be maul'd in the <IT>Dun&rehy;ciad</IT>. I would here attempt the Character of that great Lyric Poet, but that I fear the ill-natur'd will say, I am like my <IT>Lord Plausible</IT>, com&rehy;mending every Body; but I hope the Judici&rehy;ous will see that I have not given Praise to any one but who is truly worthy of Praise. No one can charge me with lavishing my Compliments upon the late Mr. <IT>Addison</IT>, or the present Dean of St. <IT>Patrick's</IT>: I have wa&rehy;sted no idle Ink in a Panegyric upon the <IT>Beggar's Opera</IT>; and as for the <IT>Dunciad</IT>, I don't in the least doubt but in a few Years it will be as much forgotten, and as little admired as the <IT>Dispensary</IT>.</P>
<P>Before I quit this Author, I must take No&rehy;tice of his barbarous Usage of that Father of <IT>English</IT> Criticism, Mr. <IT>John Dennis</IT>. Are his Labours to be wedged in between <IT>Ward</IT> and <IT>Tibbalds</IT> on the Back of his Ass? Oh Envy! Envy! What would he turn the most Vene&rehy;rable of all Criticks into Ridicule? Has not the Force of his fine Reasoning, nor his tre&rehy;mendous Aspect sufficient Power to awe him? Will he not take his own Word, that no Au<PB
N="14">thor now living has done so much for the <IT>British Stage</IT>, or defended so manfully the <IT>Cause of the British Muses</IT>? And is not theirs the Cause of our Country? What do our Armies fight for, what do our Senates debate about, if Poetry be suffer'd to languish? This awful Bard has by the Harmony of his own Numbers, shewn himself fit to judge of the Performance of others,</P>
<LG TYPE="couplet" REND="it"><L>&horfill; he alone
</L><L>Should censure freely who has written well.</L>
</LG><P>I will boldly venture to affirm, notwith&rehy;standing all that Mr. <IT>Pope</IT> and his Adherents can say, that there are some of this Gentle&rehy;man's Plays not to be equall'd by any that have come after him, I will hardly except the afore-mentioned excellent Tragedy of <SC>Mangora</SC>. Not only his own Country, but all <IT>Europe</IT> have confess'd their Admiration of his Play call'd <SC>Liberty Asserted</SC>; and her late Majesty's Ministers at <IT>Utrecht</IT>, found such Difficulties in their Negotiations upon Account of that Play, that sure it is not so long ago, but every one may remember how much the Peace was retarded thereby, because they could not be brought to consent to the sacrificing so valuable a Person as the Author of it, to the Fury of the <IT>French</IT>. As <PB
N="15">we are now in strict Alliance with that Na&rehy;tion, I would not rip up old Sores, nor men&rehy;tion their fitting out a Privateer to spirit him away from the Coast of <IT>Sussex</IT>, but only to shew of what Consequence this Gentleman has been esteem'd in the World; and now in his Decline of Life, to be treated like one who never wrote any Poetry worth reading himself, and yet has made severe and sense&rehy;less Remarks upon other People, is inhuman to the last Degree. The Character these his Enemies give of him, puts me in Mind of a certain old Gentleman I have heard of some where about <IT>Charing-Cross</IT>, who seldom leaves the Tavern till Morning, but is constantly railing at late Hours and Debauchery.</P>
<P>If the Malice of the Author of the <IT>Dun&rehy;ciad</IT> continues, I shall shortly expect to see the sacred Names of Mr. <IT>Edward Biddle</IT>, and Mr. <IT>Pickering Rich</IT>, used with as much Con&rehy;tempt as any of those he has been already pleased to satyrize. Nay, who knows but in Time he may take it into his Head to call in Question the Merits of Mr. <IT>Giles Jacob</IT>, and Mr. <IT>Bazaleel Morrice</IT>. The great Estate and Titles of the Author of <IT>Love in a Hollow Tree</IT>, it is to be hoped will be a sufficient Defence against his Lash; but it must be allowed by all Men, that he has made free with some who <PB
N="16">are but little inferior in Genius to that wise and learned Peer.</P>
<P>Now begging Pardon of my Readers for this long Digression, let me remember where I left Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, 'twas at <IT>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</IT> Play-House, in full Possession of the Applause of the Town, and in full Pay. In the Year 1715, Mr. <IT>Rich</IT>, the Patentee of the House, having resign'd the Use of his Theatre for four Nights in a Week to Mr. <IT>Keene</IT>, and Mr. <IT>Christopher Bullock</IT>, Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> was caress'd by these new Partners, if possible, with more Fondness than by their Predecessor in the Management. From the Grace in which he stood with the Town, those Gentlemen drew no small Presages of the large Advantage they should gain in their Contract, by the Merit and Applause of his Performances. In pur&rehy;suance of this Prospect, they thought it for their Interest to get up all the Plays in which he could play any Part. Nay, I am inform'd, that they have even procur'd Plays to be wrote on Purpose, that he might have an Opportu&rehy;nity of displaying his facetious Talents for the Entertainment of the Town. As the first Instance of which, I shall mention a Comedy call'd, <IT>The Woman's Revenge: Or, A Match in Newgate</IT>; which at this Day bears a very good Character, and brings considerable Audiences, wrote by Mr. <IT>Christopher Bullock</IT>, one of the <PB
N="17">above-nam'd Managers, and dedicated to Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, by that Gentleman, in Gratitude for the happy Figure he made in it. Which De&rehy;dication, upon the Account of it's Humour, I shall take the Freedom to transcribe.</P>

N="23">Dishonour of the Men he convers'd with, and taking the Advantage which he had wait&rehy;ed for, of Mr. <IT>Pinkethman's</IT> being overtaken with Liquor, without any Regard to the Laws of Society, Honesty and Justice, stole the Part of the <IT>Cobler</IT> out of his Pocket, and discharging, (as he was always exceeding Generous, when he had, as he used to call it, <IT>The Cole upon him</IT>,) the Reckoning, took his Leave of the Tavern, left his Brother <IT>Pinketh&rehy;man</IT> drunk and asleep, and went immediately with his Prize to his Friend and Patron, Mr. <IT>Christopher Bullock</IT>; who being a Person of an admirable quick Turn of Thought, and one who always knew what would make for his Interest, embraced Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> and his invaluable <IT>Piece of Theft</IT>, with all the Trans&rehy;ports that naturally arise in a truly Poetical Bosom on such an Occasion: He instantly fell to work, and by the Hints given him by <IT>Pinkethman's</IT> Part of the <IT>Cobler</IT>, was able to bring upon the Stage a Farce of the same Title as Mr. <IT>Johnson's</IT>, a Fortnight before the <IT>other House</IT> could present theirs, through the above-mentioned Advantage taken of Mr. <IT>Pinkethman</IT> by Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, the former not be&rehy;ing able to recover his Part, tho' he used the greatest Application in less than that Time.</P>
<PB N="24"><P>Now I would have the <IT>Reader</IT> to observe, that Mr. <IT>Bullock</IT>, who always prided himself upon his Attachment to the Principles of <IT>Toryism</IT>, not only robb'd the above-mention'd ingenious Mr. <IT>Charles Johnson</IT> of great Part of the large Profits which he expected from the Run of a <IT>Farce</IT>, which was wrote, so much to the Support, and the Defence of the <IT>H&horfill;r Succession</IT>, but wrote his own Farce, call'd <IT>The Cobler of Preston</IT>, likewise in quite another Manner, turning into Burlesque and Ridicule all Mr. <IT>Johnson's</IT> Thoughts and Designs, and giving Spirit to that Party which Mr. <IT>Johnson</IT> had rendred contemptible and Spiritless. To this, the <IT>Gentleman</IT> who is the Subject of my present Discourse, may be said to be accessary, and his Principles with respect to the Govern&rehy;ment, may be brought into Dispute, as he not only knew his Brother <IT>Pinkethman</IT> to be a fer&rehy;vent Friend to the <IT>Interests</IT> of his late M&horfill;y, and his Administration, but was satisfied that his Patron, Mr. <IT>Bullock</IT>, for whose Sake and Interest he was guilty of so felonious an Act, as picking Mr. <IT>Pinkethman's</IT> Pocket, was a Person whose Hopes depended entirely on the Favour of a contrary <IT>Party</IT>.
</P><P>To strengthen our Suspicion of Mr. <IT>Spil&rehy;ler's</IT> unhappy Sentiments, with regard to the G&horfill;t, and to shew the mutual Confidence that seemed to subsist between Mr. <IT>Christopher <PB
N="25">Bullock</IT> and him, I shall now take Notice of another Farce, call'd <IT>The</IT> <SC>Perjuror</SC>, wrote likewise by the abovesaid Mr. <IT>Christopher Bul&rehy;lock</IT>, which was acted in Opposition to the <SC>Nonjuror</SC>, a Comedy written by that un&rehy;doubted <IT>Lover</IT> of, and <IT>Ornament</IT> to his Coun&rehy;try, Mr. <SC>Colly Cibber</SC>, and in which Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> bore a considerable Part, and spoke a Prologue to it, which gave Mr. <IT>Cibber</IT> and the <IT>Court-Party</IT> no small Chagrin. No Body will wonder if this <IT>Farce</IT> had a considerable Run, to very large Audiences of Persons who went under the Censure of being disaffected to the Government, since Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> was the Comedian, who, next to the <IT>Party-Jokes</IT> in it, gave, by his Performance, a Life and Spirit to it.</P>
<P>The Liberty I have taken with Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Character in these Reflections on his Moral and Political Conduct, may, perhaps, seem very surprizing to those who are acquainted with the Intimacy that has been between us for near twenty Years: But the Regard I have to Truth, and my own Reputation as an Historian, compels me even to break through the Bands of Friendship; nor can I leave such a Chasm in my History, as omitting a Circumstance of such Moment to the curious Reader, as that, of his going from Mr. <IT>Rich's</IT> Theatre, (for Mr. <IT>Keene</IT> and Mr. <IT>Bullock</IT> were <PB
N="26">both dead,) in the Year 1720, to <IT>Ireland</IT>, immediately after his Benefit Night, when he received through the Generosity of the Town, an <IT>Hundred and Seven Pounds in Money</IT>, out of the Office belonging to the Play-House, and did not give any of his numerous Creditors the Favour of a Visit. He stay'd there till his Pockets were quite drain'd, or, (as he himself term'd it,) he was <IT>Seedy</IT>; and being requested by Mr. <IT>Rich</IT> to return to his <IT>House</IT>, thought it no disagreeable Invitation, and according&rehy;ly accepted of it, and came to <IT>London</IT>, and was re-established in <IT>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</IT> The&rehy;atre; but such are the Charms of good Liquor and good Company, that four Pounds a Week were not enough to keep him out of the Hug&rehy;ster's Hands; and having mortgaged his Pay, and taken up several Sums of Money at extra&rehy;vagant Interest, he was forced in the Year 1722, to take Shelter in the <IT>Mint</IT>, and being drove to very great Straits, he was reduced to have a Play acted for his Benefit in that Place; but the <IT>South-Sea</IT> Business having brought a little better Company there than usual, he made a Shift to scrape together about Twenty Pounds: The Play was <IT>The Drummer: Or, The Haunted House</IT>, to which, upon this Oc&rehy;casion, he himself wrote the following Epi&rehy;logue, which has been already printed in a Paper that came out at that Time, called <IT>The <PB

<P><PB N="29">This was the first Piece of Poetry my Friend Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, as he assur'd me himself, was ever guilty of; It is very certain, notwithstanding all the Care I have taken to give the Publick as exact an Edition of it as possible, there are many obscure Lines in it, which must arise from the Carelessness or Interpolations of Co&rehy;pyists, but the learned World may shortly ex&rehy;pect to see the Genuine Text restored by that elaborate and circumstantial Critick Mr. <IT>L.

</P><P>As it is impossible for any Man, how in&rehy;offensive soever in his own Behaviour, to pass through the World without making some E&rehy;nemies, so Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> was not without those who maliciously and groundlesly reported this <IT>Epilogue</IT> was not of his own Writing, but that <CORR

<P>The Applause Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> receiv'd from his Friends and Companions upon the Account of the above-mention'd Epilogue, encourag'd <PB

<P>The writing these Verses was occasioned by a Quarrel and Reconciliation between him and one Mrs. <IT>Stratford</IT>, dwelling in <IT>Wild-Street</IT>, with whom, after his Separation from his Wife, he lived for some Time in great Inti&rehy;macy. And here it may not be improper to give the <IT>Reader</IT> a Notion of Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Taste of Beauty, by describing the Person and Per&rehy;fections of this Lady, who had the Happiness to captivate his Heart. She was in Stature just rising to that Height where the Graceful can only begin to shew itself, of a lively As&rehy;pect; and a Command in her Mien, that like the principal Figure in the finest Paint&rehy;ings, first seizes, and longest delights the Eye of the Spectator. Her Voice was shrill, strong and piercing; her Pronunciation indeed a little too Voluble, and her Emphasis always placed with great Spirit in her Periods. She had one peculiar Happiness from Nature, she look'd, and maintain'd the Agreeable at a Time, when other fine Women only raise <PB
N="34">Admirers by their Understanding. 'Tis true she could not boast much of her <IT>Paraphernalia</IT>, her best Gown being a <IT>Coventry Yard Wide</IT>, a pretty deal the worse for wearing; but Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, while his Amour continued with her, did the utmost in his Power to see her dress'd according to her Condition, and, even when he was on the other Side of the Water, al&rehy;low'd her <IT>Fourteen Pence a Week</IT>, and gave her <IT>Three Shillings and Six-Pence at one Time, to buy her a Hoop at Rag-Fair</IT>: And not long af&rehy;ter this, upon <IT>Valentine's</IT> Day, he sent her, as she assured me herself, the following Copy of Verses, with a new flourish'd Apron.</P>

<P>By the foregoing Verses, it may be imagin'd that Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Passion for Mrs. <IT>Stratford</IT> was purely Platonick, by talking so much of her Virtue, and indeed, altho' she admitted Visits from him, she was cold to all Mankind besides, and rather than suffer another to share those Raptures which she preserv'd alone for him, or prostitute her self for Gain, she has conde&rehy;scended to several Employments much below the Dignity of one who sometimes lay by the Side of so great a Man; such as dealing, at one Season of the Year, in <IT>Asparagus</IT>, and at another in <IT>Rumps, Burs</IT>, and hot bak'd <IT>Faggots</IT>.</P>
<P>Now I am upon the Topick of Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Amours, I cannot omit that which he carry'd on with Mrs. <IT>D</IT>&horfill; the Duke of <IT>R</IT>&horfill;s Mistress, which lasted for a considerable Time, but ended, at last, in a great Quarrel between them, and the utter Ruin of Mrs. <IT>D</IT>&horfill; in the Duke's Favour, through Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> inadvertent Discovery of the Intrigue for a Joke; For being dress'd a little cleaner than ordinary, and the Duke happening to be behind the Scenes, could not help taking No&rehy;tice of it. <Q>"Yes,</Q> (says <IT>Jemmy</IT>) <Q>my Linnen is not only clean, but as fine as any of your Grace's.</Q> <Q>"That's impossible,</Q> reply'd the Duke, upon which the other shew'd his Grace the Coronet and his own Mark upon his Shirt, it being one Mrs. <IT>D</IT>&horfill; had, that Day, lent him. The Duke, by this Circum&rehy;stance being convinc'd of what he had some slight Suspicion of before, from that Night would never have any thing to say to her; so that the Lady lost a very good Keeper, and poor <IT>Spiller</IT> an Opportunity of appearing so spruce as she oftentimes made him. He thought himself so happy in her good Graces, <PB

<P>Whatever Opinion the World may have of Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> as a Poet, I am sure Nobody will refuse him the Praises due to a good-humour'd Fellow and a most facetious Companion. Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> was not only esteem'd by the Managers of the House, as one on whom much of their Interest depended by all the Frequenters of that House, for the constant Diversion his hu&rehy;morous Behaviour on the Stage afforded them; but in private Conversation, by many of the smartest and prettiest Fellows about Town, who acquired that Character oftentimes by re&rehy;tailing his merry Conceits to their Companions: Nay, some Persons of the first Rank have not thought an Evening ill spent in so good Com&rehy;pany: the late Duke of <IT>Wharton</IT> particularly took much Pleasure in passing some of those <PB
N="38">Hours he devoted to Mirth, in the Company of honest <IT>Jemmy</IT>; a Familiarity with a Man of such Quality is certainly to be look'd upon as a great Honour done to a Person of his low Station of Life, but it happen'd quite other&rehy;wise at a certain Time to poor <IT>Spiller</IT>, for his Grace having, one Evening, an unaccountable Frolick come into his Head of obliging every Man in Company to disrobe himself at ev'ry Health that was drank, of some Part of his Covering, first a Peruke, then a Coat, and af&rehy;terwards a Waistcoat. Poor <IT>Jemmy</IT>, when they came to the last, made a Thousand Ex&rehy;cuses, but all to no Purpose, for the Duke in&rehy;sisting upon having his Toast pledg'd in the same Manner he had drank it himself, he was forced to own that having <SC>Mislaid</SC> his Shirt he had forgot to put it on that Day, and so was expos'd in his <IT>Buff</IT> to the whole Company, which, you may imagine occasion'd not a little Laughter; therefore how much happier had it been for him to have contented himself that Evening, with the humble <IT>Conundrums</IT> of some of the Peers of his own House, who might have been in the same Condition with himself. But this cursed Ambition leads a Man into numberless Inconveniences.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> free and expensive Manner of Living still continuing, and not having the Convenience of his usual Sanctuary in Cases of <PB
N="39">Extremity, the <IT>Mint</IT>, that Place being put down by Act of Parliament, he became a Victim to the Resentment of his mercyless Creditors, and a wretched Property to Bailiffs and Spun&rehy;ging Houses, by whom, after they had drain'd his Pocket to the last Half Penny, he was un&rehy;generously deliver'd up to Goal. But in this Place it was his peculiar good Fortune to ex&rehy;perience, contrary to the usual Custom of those Places, a great Indulgence and Civility, upon the Account of the pleasant and facetious Tem&rehy;per which he preserv'd in those unhappy Cir&rehy;cumstances; and particularly when he was thrown into the <IT>Marshalsea</IT> Prison, at a certain Time, at the Suit of several Persons, his jo&rehy;cose Conversation so won upon the Good-Na&rehy;ture of the Person who was then <IT>Deputy-keeper</IT> of the Goal, that he found a very sincere, ge&rehy;nerous and serviceable Friend in him ever af&rehy;ter; not only assisting him at that Juncture, to make his Affairs easy with his Plaintiffs, and appear in the World again, but continu&rehy;ing the same good Office to him, whenever it was his Fate to come under his Hands as a Prisoner again. In short, by the Management and unwearied Industry of this Person, Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Circumstances were, a few Months before the World was depriv'd of him, brought into so easy and comfortable a Situation, that he could not only, on a common Week Day, <PB
N="40">venture out of the Play-house, which was made a Sort of Garrison by those of his Bro&rehy;ther Comedians who went under a small Sus&rehy;picion of Debt, to pay his Friends a merry Vi&rehy;sit or so, but even was able to give his Ac&rehy;quaintance the Enjoyment of his Company, whole Days and Nights together, without the least Apprehension of Danger, at the House of his above-mentioned Friend, who being of too generous and humane a Temper to con&rehy;tinue in the Office of a Goaler, and live in Luxury by the Misfortunes of Wretches who were committed to his Custody, quitted that mercenary Employment, and took a publick victualling House near <IT>Clare-Market</IT>; where, His Sign, though seemingly well adapted for the <IT>Place</IT>, was judg'd too vulgar and unpolite to countenance the Resort of such Gentlemen of <IT>Taste</IT> and <IT>Consequence</IT> as Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Mirth and influence invited thither, was, by the con&rehy;current Desire of an elegant Company, who were assembled there over a Bowl of Arrack Punch, one Evening, (about Three Months before Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Death) and by the generous Offer of Mr. <IT>Legar</IT>, who was one of the Com&rehy;pany, and as excellent a Master in the Science of <IT>Painting</IT> as <IT>Musick</IT>, chang'd from the <IT>Bull</IT> and <IT>Butcher</IT>, to Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Head; and drawn by the said Mr. <IT>Legar</IT>, gratis, in a Manner, and with a Pencil, that equal the <PB
N="41">proudest Performances of those who have ac&rehy;quired the greatest Wealth and Reputation in the <IT>Art of</IT> <SC>Painting</SC>.</P>
<P>To prove that he was an exceeding good Punster, pray take the following Specimen of his Wit in that Way. It was at a Time when the Town gave but very little Encouragement to <IT>Lincoln's-Inn-Theatre</IT>, which forced the Master of the House to be a little behind-hand with his Actors. They being met as usual at Rehearsal on a <IT>Saturday</IT> Morning, with Hopes of receiving some Part of their Pay, young <IT>Bullock</IT>, who had always a strict Friendship with Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, after having been at the Of&rehy;fice, comes upon the Stage again to his Friend, with a <CORR
SIC="sorrwful">sorrowful</CORR> Countenance, <IT>Faith</IT>, Jemmy, <IT>there's no</IT> <SC>Cole</SC>, said he; <IT>Cole</IT> you must un&rehy;derstand is a <IT>Cant-Word</IT> for Money. <IT>Why</IT>, then reply'd the other, <IT>if there is no</IT> <SC>Cole</SC>, <IT>we must burn</IT> <SC>Wood</SC>. You are likewise to remark here, that <IT>Wood</IT> was the Name of the Man who was to pay them.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> Wit was not the Effect of Wine; for he was the same over humble Porter; the same when he drank nothing; nay, like that arch <IT>French</IT> Wag <IT>Scarron</IT>, he would sport in the midst of Pain; for being one Night in great Torture with the Tooth-Ach, a Barber that was behind the Scenes, desired that he would let him draw his Tooth for him, <IT>No</IT>, <PB
N="42">said he, <IT>I can't spare one now, Friend, but you may draw them all after the</IT> 10th <IT>of</IT> June <IT>if you please, for I shall have no Occasion for them then</IT>; meaning when the Company gave over playing, he should have nothing to eat.</P>
<P>Going one Day through <IT>Rag-Fair</IT>, he cheapen'd a <IT>Leg of Mutton</IT>, for which they ask'd him Two Shillings; <IT>No</IT>, says <IT>Jemmy, I can't afford to give you Two Shillings for a</IT> <SC>Second-Hand</SC> <IT>Leg of Mutton, when I can buy a</IT> <SC>New One</SC> <IT>in</IT> Clare-Market <IT>for Half a Crown</IT>.</P>
<P>A certain Officer of the Army, who was very much addicted to enlarge his Narratives beyond the Bounds of Truth, was, one Night, diverting the Company behind the Scenes with an Account of a <SC>Pike</SC> that he saw alive, which was above <IT>Five Foot long. Pish</IT>, reply&rehy;ed <IT>Spiller, That's nothing, I myself have seen a</IT> <SC>Half-Pike</SC> <IT>six Foot long, that has not been worth Two-pence</IT>.</P>
<P>When he lay ill of the Small-Pox some Years since, an Acquaintance coming to see him, and bewailing the Misfortune of his be&rehy;ing at that Time Blind, <IT>Oh</IT>, said he, <IT>I shan't be so long, for Puppies you know always see at the End of Nine Days</IT>. Nay, but a few Days before he died, being carried up to lye in a Room on the same Floor with Mr. <IT>Walker</IT> at the Play-House, with whom he had had some <PB
N="43">little Dispute not long before, <IT>You see</IT> Tom, said he, <IT>I have kept my Word; I told you I would be</IT> even <IT>with you before long</IT>.</P>
<P>To mention all the numerous Circumstances that attended the Life of this valuable Member of our Common-Wealth, Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>, is a Task which I am perswaded, his dearest Friends, and those who are most religiously tender and careful of his Memory, will excuse me from undertaking. Let it suffice, that during the Run of the <IT>Beggar's Opera</IT>, which was the longest that any Dramatick Piece that ever yet appeared upon the <IT>British</IT> Stage met with, he made his last important Figure as a <IT>Comedian</IT>, in the Character of <SC>Matt</SC> <IT>of the</IT> <SC>Mint</SC>, which seems to be the next in Rank to that of <SC>Macheath</SC>, and <IT>outdid his usual Outdoings</IT> to such a Degree, that whenever he sung the following AIRS, which I shall take the Li&rehy;berty to transcribe, he executed his Part with so truly sweet and harmonious a Tone, and in so judicious and ravishing a Manner, that the Audience could not avoid putting his Mo&rehy;desty to the Blush, by repeated Clamours of <FOREIGN

<P>I am not insensible that those Persons are not wanting, who either wantonly or malici&rehy;ously report that Mr. <IT>Spiller's</IT> doing so much Justice to this his Part of <SC>Matt</SC> <IT>of the</IT> <SC>Mint</SC> <PB
N="45">is to be attributed to the Fondness he frequent&rehy;ly shew'd of resorting, in Company with his Brother <IT>Pinkethman</IT>, and other Comedians of the same Note for a polite Taste, to the <IT>Tap&rehy;houses</IT>, or <IT>Lodges</IT> of most of the Goals in <IT>London</IT>, and the particular Esteem which he always express'd for the instructive and elegant Conversation of Mrs <IT>Spurling</IT>, whose inspiring Liquors have encourag'd such Numbers of <IT>Newgate</IT> Heroes, to laugh both at the Laws of their Country, and the <SC>Ordinary's</SC> pious Exhortations at the <IT>Gallows</IT>.</P>
<P>But as I am ambitious only how to render this my Account of his Life worthy the Pe&rehy;rusal of the sedate, virtuous and well-meaning Part of my Countrymen, I shall not descend to sacrifice the Character of my <IT>Hero</IT>, by giving into any such foolish or disingenuous Suggesti&rehy;ons, but conclude that he always thought him&rehy;self bound in Honour, to do every Author who brought a Play upon the Stage, and o&rehy;bliged him with a Part in it, the strictest Justice imaginable, and upon that Principle only, prevail'd upon himself to enter into this particular Part with so much Sprightliness and Vigour, in Defiance of our common <IT>Laws, De&rehy;cency</IT>, or <IT>Chr&horfill;an&horfill;ty</IT>, to all which he, at other Times, profess'd the most zealous Sub&rehy;mission and Adherence.</P>
<P>This was the last Part, as I observ'd before, <PB N="46">in which he appear'd on the <IT>British</IT> Theatre, truly like a Comedian, and like Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT>; not that he did not act in several other Parts besides, in the same Season, but that the Ma&rehy;ster of the House, biggotted to a Performance by which he had got so much Money, was loath to take off the good Impression which it had made on the Town, and therefore thought proper to represent no other Plays, during the Intermission of its Run, than such, as by frequent Use, were grown stale, and uncapa&rehy;ble of recovering the Taste and Senses of the People, and in which Mr. <IT>Spiller</IT> could not appear with his usual Advantage.</P>
<P>Let me desire the <IT>Reader</IT> now (having gone through all the material Circumstances of his Life, which I was acquainted with, either by my own particular Knowledge, or the Infor&rehy;mation of those who were most intimate with him, with the greatest Impartiality) to view him in his last melan&rehy;cholly Scene, (melancholly Retrospection indeed, to all the Friends of Wit, Humour, and good Acting!) His De&rehy;parture from the <IT>Stage</IT>, not only of <IT>Lincoln's&rehy;Inn-Fields</IT> Theatre, but of Life itself.</P>
<P>Being always ready to discharge his Duty to the Play-House, in whatever Manner he should be appointed, on the 31st Day of <IT>January</IT>, when His Royal Highness the Prince of <IT>Wales</IT> had commanded a Play to be acted, <PB
N="47">to which the Entertainment of <IT>Pluto</IT> and <IT>Pro&rehy;serpine</IT> was to be added, and in which he was to perform a very important Part, he would by no Means, notwithstanding he found him&rehy;self out of Order, give an Interruption to the Business of the House, by publishing his Ill&rehy;ness, but ventur'd on the Stage, where, in the Midst of the Part he was to perform, he was seized with a Sort of an Apoplectick Fit, and carried off the Stage, to have the Assistance of a Surgeon, who, notwithstanding he us'd all his Art, could not give a longer Respite to his Life, than till the 7th Day of <IT>February</IT>, when he expired in the very same Room which occasioned that <IT>Pun</IT> before-mention'd, which he made to Mr. <IT>Walker</IT>.</P>
<P>Having thus done Justice, I hope to the Memory of my deceased Friend, I shall only add, that he was buried at the Expence of Mr. <IT>Rich</IT>, the Master of the Theatre, by Mr. <IT>Hawkins</IT>, an Undertaker, living in St. <IT>Clement's</IT> Parish, in the Church-Yard belonging to the said Parish, three Days after his Death, in a very decent Manner, in the 37th Year of his Age, and that the following Epitaph was de&rehy;dicated to his Memory by a Butcher of <IT>Clare-Market</IT>, who had frequently partaken the Plea&rehy;sure of his most agreeable Company, at the House which was honour'd with his <IT>Sign</IT>.</P>
