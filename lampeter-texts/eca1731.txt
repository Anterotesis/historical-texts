<HEAD><BO>REMARKS</BO> Upon a BOOK, Entituled, <IT>The Present State of the Sugar Colonies considered</IT>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<p>&Iic;T is not possible that the Island of <IT>Barbadoes</IT> in particular, with&rehy;out making less Sugar, can ever make more Rum than they have lately made; nor can it be ima&rehy;gined, that they will make more Sugar there in a Year, than hath been made <PB
N="4">there in Time past; yet all the Sugar, Rum, and whatever has been produced there, has been taken off their Hands, at a Price too al&rehy;ways above what these Goods might have been purchased for from the <IT>French</IT>. Now suppo&rehy;sing our other Islands to have produced all the Commodities which they possibly could, and that all those Commodities have been constant&rehy;ly taken off their Hands by <IT>England</IT>, and our Northern Plantations, and have not been e&rehy;nough for them; but they have been under the Necessity of taking vast Quantities of Molosses from the foreign Islands; which some of those Northern People daily distil into Rum, and are likewise glad to take some Rum from these Foreigners to supply their <IT>Indian</IT> Trades, their own People, and, what is still more absolute&rehy;ly necessary, their Fisheries, which above all Trades whatever deserve the highest Encou&rehy;ragement. Supposing this to be the Case (which it really is) then it is obvious that our Northern Plantations ought not to be restrain&rehy;ed from trading to the foreign Islands. In ma&rehy;ny Trades it is not easy to distinguish the pro&rehy;fitable from the disadvantageous. This of the Fishery is an inexhaustible Mine. Hence ari&rehy;ses more visible Advantage than by any Trade which we drive; yet a very little Deviation from the Ways we are now settled in might ruin the whole Trade. I will take upon me to say, that if our Northern Colonies should be prohibited from trading to the foreign Islands, <PB
N="5">that in two Years Time the <IT>French</IT> in their own Vessels would supply all the Fishermen that were left (if any should be left) with Rum and Molosses from <IT>Cape Breton</IT>; and the Charge to prevent this (if it were possible) could not be sustained by the Trade.</P>
<P>But to reduce this Argument to Order. <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, all the <IT>Leeward</IT> Islands, and <IT>Ja&rehy;maica</IT>, produce all the Sugar, Rum and Mo&rehy;losses which they can produce; and these are all taken off their Hands by our own People, and our own Shipping: And though they do not produce sufficient for all our Demands, they desire that we will oblige ourselves to take none from any others, though those would sell us cheaper: And this they say is for our Inte&rehy;rest, which I am so blind as not to see; but should really think, that if after our own Su&rehy;gars, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> were brought home, and we had not quite enough, and knew where to get them, especially when they were to be got cheaper, which I certainly do, that it would be better to send for them, than wait a great while, and at last be obliged to buy them out of Hucksters Hands. Nay I protest, so far am I from see&rehy;ing, as these Gentlemen would have me, that I think if we did not want an Ounce of any of those Commodities, and could be employed to bring all the Sugar from <IT>Brazil</IT>, and all the Rum, Sugar, and Molosses from the <IT>West-India</IT> Islands, that we might make as good a Hand of it as any trading People whatever, perhaps <PB
N="6">have full as much Profit upon the Whole, as the Owners.</P>
<P>Now admit these Islands could but just sup&rehy;ply our own Necessities, we should not have one Ounce for Exportation; whereas now we have just so much more as we bring home from all other Places. Let us not be so weak as, at the Loss of the Employment of so many of our own Shipping, and possibly the very Destructi&rehy;on of our <IT>American</IT> Fishery and <IT>Indian</IT> Trade, and consequently the Impoverishment of our Northern Colonies, to enrich those Islanders, who yet are the most opulent, most splendid, and gay People in all his Majesty's Dominions. But if these Islands are really under any Hard&rehy;ships, which I think won't be denied, when I fairly state the Case, and shew some Advantages that the <IT>French</IT> have over our Sugar Colonies, I persuade my self it will be thought the Interest of this Kingdom to take away all unreasonable and unnecessary Restraints upon that Trade.</P>
<P>The <IT>French</IT> by two several Edicts, one <IT>Jan.</IT> 27, 1726, and another in <IT>August</IT> 1727. took off a Restraint, which till that Time they had continued upon their own Sugar Colonies, <IT>viz.</IT> that of obliging all their Ships to come to <IT>France</IT> first, with the Production of those Co&rehy;lonies; and by those Edicts, gave full Liberty to their Merchants to send directly to <IT>Spain</IT> all Sugars, and other Merchandize, the Pro&rehy;duce of their Islands in <IT>America, (Muscovado</IT> or raw Sugars only excepted). By this the <PB
N="7"><IT>French</IT>, who I am confident, cannot navigate so cheap as we, have an Advantage of getting their Produce to Market cheaper; and conse&rehy;quently, supposing our Plantations and theirs upon a <IT>Par</IT> in all other Respects, can get, when our own would lose. Wherefore, tho' I cannot think it proper or convenient at this Time to restrain or prohibit our Northern Co&rehy;lonies, or indeed any other Trade that we have with the <IT>French</IT> in the <IT>West-Indies</IT> for Sugar, Rum, Molosses, or any other Productions of their Islands: Yet I am of Opinion that our own People ought to be put upon a <IT>Par</IT>, at least with those of any other Nation, especial&rehy;ly where it will not be attended with any ill Consequence to this Kingdom: And therefore to put our own Colonies upon an equal Foot with the <IT>French</IT>, I think that they ought to be permitted to carry their clay'd Sugar directly to any Part of <IT>Europe</IT> to the Southward of <IT>Cape Finisterre</IT>, obliging the Shipping to the same Rules and Restrictions that those are under, which carry Fish and Rice from our Northern Colonies there.</P>
<P>With me there is no Doubt of such Regu&rehy;lation being an Advantage to this Kingdom as we are now circumstanced. Suppose for In&rehy;stance, that <IT>John English</IT> is at <IT>Barbadoes</IT> pos&rehy;sess'd of 2000 Hogsheads of Sugar, and that he is well inform'd that all the Markets in <IT>Eu&rehy;rope</IT> to the Northward of Cape <IT>Finisterre</IT> are fully supplied with Sugars, he really wants to <PB
N="8">turn that Sugar into Money, and wants that Money in <IT>England</IT>; but, as I said before, <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT> being supplied, and he wanting Money only there, and hearing also that his Sugars would sell in <IT>Spain</IT> or <IT>Italy</IT>, he carries them there directly and sells for Money, which he remits to <IT>England</IT>, in this Case <IT>England</IT> be&rehy;comes possess'd of the whole Money these Goods sold for at the best Market, only one Freight deducted, that is, the Freight from <IT>Barbadoes</IT> to the Place of Sale directly, which to <IT>Spain</IT>, or even to <IT>Italy</IT>, will not exceed the usual Freight to <IT>England</IT>. Now if he is oblig'd to go to <IT>England</IT> first, though he knows that Kingdom cannot take them off his Hands, and that he must carry them to <IT>Spain</IT> or <IT>Italy</IT> afterward, will he not have a great deal of Reason to complain, and may he not say, and reasonably too, "Why do you put me to this unnecessary Expence of double Freight and double Charge? Every Penny which I lose is lost to the Kingdom, or would be sa&rehy;ved to the Kingdom by the contrary Pra&rehy;ctice. For suppose, for Example, on this Account, here are 200 Men of your King&rehy;dom employ'd in this Service, for which your Kingdom is to receive a certain Price or Reward, is not the quickest and cheapest Way of doing it the best for you, as well as me? You have Business enough to employ those Men in afterward, or if not, they may be profitably employed by others, and by <PB
N="9">that Means acquire just as much more as I should save. Will not my Sugars sell for as much <DEL
TYPE="overstrike" RESP="annotator">more</DEL>, when carried from our own I&rehy;slands directly, as if they had been brought to <IT>England</IT> and landed there, and then ship&rehy;ped off for such Place? Yes surely, and with less Waste to me, as well as Charge, the whole Produce of my Sugars will as cer&rehy;tainly center in <IT>England</IT> in one Case as the other."</P>
<P>I will defy any one to prove the contrary of this, yet do we still continue to restrain our own People from enlarging and extending our own Trade, while other Nations are using all the Means they apprehend to be in their Power to extend and enlarge theirs. Hence I appre&rehy;hend the Reasonableness of tolerating our Ship&rehy;ping to carry clayed Sugars to any part of <IT>Eu&rehy;rope</IT> within the Limits aforesaid; and whereas there remained as a Duty to the Crown about 8<IT>d</IT> 1/2 on every 112<IT>l.</IT> exported hence, I would propose, instead thereof, to pay to his Maje&rehy;sty's Receiver of enumerated Duties in all our Colonies, 12 Pence <IT>per</IT> Hundred upon all Su&rehy;gars shipp'd thence, for any Part of <IT>Europe</IT> to the Southward of Cape <IT>Finisterre</IT>. This is what I really apprehend will be for the Good of this Kingdom; we shall in all Respects be Carriers of the same Quantities we now are, and there will be gained or saved to this King&rehy;dom just so much as the Freight from <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT> to <IT>Spain</IT>, or <IT>Italy</IT>, at least. This I conceive <PB
N="10">will put our Sugar Colonies upon a <IT>Par</IT> with the <IT>French</IT>; and I should really be very glad if I knew of any other Way of serving our Islands without Detriment to the Publick. Should we lay on any Duties upon the <IT>French</IT> Commo&rehy;dities imported to our Northern Colonies, they ought to be very small, lest we should lose what is so very beneficial, I mean the em&rehy;ploying of at least 15000 Tons of Ship&rehy;ping, and not less than 2000 Men, beside the Advantage of supplying our Fisheries and <IT>In&rehy;dian</IT> Trades cheap, thereby also enabling the Northern Colonies to make such considerable Remittances here in Money, as well as in Indi&rehy;go, Cocoa, Sugar and Rum. For, as they trade for all these Commodities with the <IT>French</IT> as well as <IT>English</IT>, whatever remains over and a&rehy;bove their own Use, is saved and sent home, more especially such Part or Commodity as was produced on any of our own Islands, which is equal to so much real Treasure brought into this Kingdom, either to supply our own Wants, or to sell to our Neighbours; for all which, beside the real Freight and Commissions stay&rehy;ing with us for ever, we send them in Return woollen Manufactures principally, by which Means we are greater Gainers than we should be by those who took from us principally the Manufactures of <IT>India, Holland, Flanders</IT>, or <IT>Germany</IT>; and all that is gained this Way, is by our own Labour chiefly.</P>
<PB N="11"><P>The Lumber which our Northern Colonies supply the <IT>French</IT> with costs nothing but La&rehy;bour, and their Horses would be <CORR
SIC="of of">of</CORR> no Va&rehy;lue, but for that Trade; and what is worst of all, if we did not supply them that Way, they could serve themselves, by which they would increase their Trade and Navigation exactly in Proportion to our Loss. With Lumber they might be supplied from their Settlements of <IT>Mobile, Pansecola</IT>, and <IT>Fort Louis</IT>, in the Bay of <IT>Apalachy</IT>. I will suppose a Sloop loaden with Lumber there, (and she may be as easily loaden there as in any Part of the Universe) and will leave it to any Man acquainted with Na&rehy;vigation and Freighting of Sloops, whether in Time of Peace particularly, if he were offer&rehy;ed twenty Shillings in a Ton more Freight from thence to <IT>Martinico</IT> than from <IT>Carolina, Virginia, Philadelphia, New-York, Rhode-I&rehy;sland, Boston</IT>, or any other Place on the <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> Continent of <IT>America</IT>, he would not ac&rehy;cept of it from the Bay of <IT>Apalachy</IT>. I declare I would; and I am persuaded I could make more Voyages in a Year between <IT>Mobile</IT> and <IT>Martinico</IT>, than I could between <IT>Boston</IT> and <IT>Martinico</IT>, as I should be pretty sure of a fair Wind always from <IT>Martinico</IT> down to the <IT>Bay</IT>; the Time of gaining a Passage thence through the <IT>Gulph</IT>, would not be longer than the Advantage I had by the Shortness of the Passage down: And considering that in this last Case you are more out of the Way of North<PB
N="12">West Winds, and never in the Way of them, but when they would be fair for you, really I can make but little Difference in the Choice of the Voyages; but admitting it were twenty Shillings <IT>per</IT> Ton, what a prodigious Sum should we lose, and the <IT>French</IT> be so little, if any worse, supplied?</P>
<P>Then as to Horses and Mules, they may be supplied with them full as cheap from the <IT>Spanish</IT> Coast. I allow that they must give perhaps thirty Pieces of Eight for each Mule upon the Coast in the Way of Trade; or if they purchase at <IT>Curasoa</IT>, as they generally have done, they pay so much Cash; I will suppose in this Case, after Freight and all other Charges, that a Mule in <IT>Martinico</IT> cannot be sold for less than 400 Livres (<IT>i.e.</IT>) 25 Pistoles there. In this Case <IT>Martinico</IT> is as well suppli&rehy;ed as if they could have <IT>New England</IT> Horses, or any other, at half that Price; and it will be allowed me by all who know this Trade, that I have not advanced any Thing about the Mule Trade which hath not been practised. Horses are of such small Value on the Coast of <IT>Coro</IT>, that as fine Horses as I ever beheld are sold for two or three Pieces of Eight each in Trade. These we cannot carry to <IT>Martinico</IT>, because the Charge would be the same, or more, than on a Mule, and they would not sell for above half a Mule's Price. I have been told by both <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Spaniards</IT>, that a Mule will conti&rehy;nue fit for Service 45 or 50 Years, and that <PB
N="13">they are not so liable to Diseases in any De&rehy;gree as Horses, though they use them more cruelly, and take no manner of Care of them. I have shewn where they may have their Lum&rehy;ber, and where they may again be supplied with Cattle more to their Profit than they now are.</P>
<P>I will just mention an Advantage which the Government at present enjoys by the Importa&rehy;tion of Rum, which I apprehend would be quite lost, should our Northern Plantations be restrained from trading to the Foreign Islands. All the Rum which our own Islands produce, is not sufficient to supply the Northern Colo&rehy;nies, if there be Truth in some Reports, and I am inclinable to believe them, <IT>viz.</IT> That <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Vide</FOREIGN> p. 19. of a Book, entituled, <IT>The Present State of the Sugar Colonies considered</IT>.</NOTE> there hath been 20000 Hogsheads of <IT>French</IT> Molosses manufactured into Rum in <IT>New Eng&rehy;land</IT> in one Year, beside <IT>French</IT> Rum import&rehy;ed; the Consumption on that Commodity must be prodigious there, for I am well assured that a Gallon of Molosses will make a Gallon of Rum; consequently there was, at only 63 Gal&rehy;lons <IT>per</IT> Hogshead of Molosses, (though they are generally from 80 to 100 Gallons) 1,260,000 Gallons of Rum made in <IT>Boston</IT> in one Year, which I believe is more than ever was import&rehy;ed in one or two Years into <IT>England</IT>. This will plainly prove, that if <IT>Boston</IT> must and doth ex&rehy;pend annually such a Quantity, or but half of <PB
N="14">it, by prohibiting the Trade between the Nor&rehy;thern Colonies and the <IT>French</IT> Islands, not one Drop of Rum could be brought home here, and consequently the Revenue would suffer just the Sum now received on that Head, un&rehy;til the <IT>French</IT> had settled into a Trade of send&rehy;ing their Rum to <IT>Europe</IT>, which there is no Reason to doubt but they would, as well as send Sugars to <IT>Holland</IT> and <IT>Hambourgh</IT>. Then I expect we should have <IT>French</IT> Rum import&rehy;ed here (as we now have their Brandy) to the Loss of all the Advantage we now receive by that Commodity.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen, I am told, say, that the <IT>French</IT> would throw away all their Molosses, if the <IT>New-England</IT> Men did not take it off their Hands; whence they can have Reason for this, I cannot imagine. Fifty, nay forty Years ago, I have heard that the Molosses were all wasted in <IT>Jamaica</IT>. They produced fine Sugars may Years before they made any Rum, and were taught at last by the <IT>Barbadians</IT> to make Rum, even better than their own. The Northern Colonies used to take all that they produced at first, but when they excelled in the Goodness of that Commodity, and found that it would answer to send it to <IT>England</IT>, they raised their Price so high, that very small Quantities are taken from thence by the Nor&rehy;thern Colonies, yet they want not a Vent for all that they can produce; and I am well assu&rehy;red, that if <IT>Jamaica</IT> were now to be hinder<PB
N="15">ed or restrained from importing Rum or Mo&rehy;losses into <IT>Great Britain</IT>, or any other of his Majesty's Dominions, that they would not&rehy;withstanding such Restraint, have Vent for their Rum; and that there would not be one Drop less made, nor one Gallon of Molosses wasted, more than now is. The <IT>Dutch</IT> would be glad to carry it to <IT>Holland</IT>, if it were but a very little cheaper than it generally is in <IT>Ja&rehy;maica</IT>. It is not an unusual Thing for the home&rehy;ward-bound Ships in <IT>Curasoa</IT> to take in Pro&rehy;portion to the Price of Rum from three or four; to twenty Puncheons of <IT>Kill Devil</IT>, as they call it. I have known vast Quantities of Rum there at a time, as well as Sugars, from the <IT>English, French</IT>, and <IT>Dutch</IT> Islands, and the Island of St. <IT>Thomas</IT>. There are many Ships of vast Burden there frequently, and they are glad of Sugars, or indeed whatever will answer in <IT>Holland</IT>, to fill up; and if we were weak enough to suppose that the <IT>French</IT> would waste their Molosses now they have learnt (tho' God knows they knew before we did) how to extract a Spirit from Molosses, we should be as much deceived as those Gentle&rehy;men are, who think they could not be sup&rehy;plied with Cattle or Lumber but from our Plantations.</P>
<P>During Queen <IT>Anne's</IT> War they made Rum in <IT>Martinico</IT>, for I have tasted it on Board of more than one <IT>Martinico</IT> Prize during that War, and they then found Cask for their Su<PB
N="16">gar, Rum and Indico, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> In the Year 1713, or early in 1714, when I believe that Island had never received any of our Northern Lum&rehy;ber, but such as they had taken as Prize du&rehy;ring the preceding War; then was I told by several Gentlemen of that Island, that notwith&rehy;standing that long War, they had increased their Plantations, Numbers and Produce to such a Degree, that they then employed three Times the Quantity of Shipping that they could before that War. At <IT>Fort St. Pierre</IT>, and <IT>Fort-Royal</IT>, there was then above sixty Sail of Ships, some of them of forty Guns, and all Merchantmen; even then there was a good deal of Wood upon the Island; and I have seen many Hundreds, I believe many Thousand of Tierces, made of the Wood which grew on the Island. I have seen the Coopers making them, and if that Island is now cleared, surely they would make free enough with <IT>Dominico, St. Lucia</IT>, and <IT>St. Vincent</IT>; as they hitherto have done for Mill-Wood, and their principal Timber, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> Whereas if we were to exert our selves, as I believe we have a Right to do, and hinder them, have not I shewn where they could have enough? But the Danger of their encreasing upon our Backs in <IT>America</IT> ought to be of some Moment in our Considerations on this Affair, as well as the Increase of their Shipping and Navigation, which, in Case of any Rupture between the Crowns, would <PB
N="17">make them more formidable by Sea, where only we have any Reason to value them.</P>
<P>In the last mentioned Year a Person of my Acquaintance bought several Hogsheads of Rum in <IT>Martinico</IT>, as well as Sugar, and car&rehy;ried them to <IT>Curasoa</IT>. The Rum he bought for six <IT>Sol's</IT>, which was not 4<IT>d.</IT> Sterling <IT>per</IT> Gallon; for a Pistole then, and I think now is, 16 Livres: However so it was, and continued from 1713, to 1716, to my Knowledge, Then too were great Quantities of Money sent from <IT>Barbadoes</IT> to <IT>Martinico</IT>, and much greater Quantities brought back from <IT>Martinico</IT> for it: For as Money went by Tale among the <IT>French</IT>, and by Weight with the <IT>English</IT>, all the light Money was carried from the <IT>English</IT>, and the heavy brought from the <IT>French</IT>. I have re&rehy;ceived a good Pistole or <IT>Lewis d'Or</IT> there in Exchange for 32 <IT>Ryals</IT>, which I am sure did not weigh two Ounces; so that I am not so much surprized to hear, that that Island wants Money, and insists on Part Money, when they sell their Sugars, as I was then at their Weak&rehy;ness; and indeed if I had ever expected any Complaint against that Trade, I should have thought that our own People should have been the last to have made it. The Trade we carry on there is against their Laws: The Governor there, it is true, hath a Power to admit of Ne&rehy;cessaries being imported, at the Request of the Inhabitants; but if he were not constantly bribed by our People, he might see more clearly, and <PB
N="18">act more for the Good of his Countrey.</P>
<P>Monsieur <IT>Du Quesne</IT>, who succeeded Gene&rehy;ral <IT>Phelipeaux</IT> in the Government of that Place, knew the Interest of his own Countrey very well; yet he was better satisfied that <IT>Englishmen</IT> should bring Mules to that Island, for every one of which he received 100 Livres, than if their own People had done it, where he could have got nothing at all. Are there any of our Peo&rehy;ple trade there without bribing the Gover&rehy;nor? No, not one: Yet after all these Bribes paid and included, I can purchase forty Thou&rehy;sand Pounds of Sugar there for less Money, or less Goods, than I can in <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, or any of our own Islands; and, if permitted, could bring them to <IT>England</IT>, and afford them 20 <IT>per Cent.</IT> cheaper: But as I cannot do that in <IT>England</IT>, being restrained by Law, I carry those Goods to <IT>Holland</IT>, or <IT>Hambourgh</IT>, or <IT>Spain</IT>, or <IT>Portu&rehy;gal</IT> or <IT>North America</IT>, and there can actually gain 20 <IT>per Cent.</IT> more than I could have done, had I purchased them in <IT>Barbadoes</IT>. Why, say some People, "This is what we have been proving, and would have you believe this is a real Detriment to <IT>England</IT>. Had not the <IT>Englishmen</IT> better sit still, than carry <IT>Frenchmens</IT> Goods, though they get 20 <IT>per Cent.</IT> more by them than they can by their own, and leave the French to carry their own Goods themselves? They are able e&rehy;nough, we warrant you, and will soon be used to it. We, with the Assistance of the <PB
N="19">other Islands, can supply <IT>Great Britain</IT>, and the Plantations with all they want; though lately indeed we have proved, that the Northern Colonies have taken above half their Rum and Molosses from the <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT>, and all that we made besides, except what Rum we sent to <IT>England</IT>. Now notwithstanding we have really made as much Rum, Sugar, and Molosses upon the Island of <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, as is possible we ever can do again, because there's not a Foot of Ground unimproved in the whole Island. And though all the other of our Islands have produced as much Rum and Molosses as they were able to do, not wasting a Drop of ei&rehy;ther, and the Northern People took off all that too, and as much more of the <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT>, yet we can supply them our&rehy;selves; tho' we prove we all cannot, or have not, produced so much by one half as they have taken, and will want.<ADD>"</ADD></P>
<P>Another Thing hath been advanced which shews equal Strength, namely, that it is a Da&rehy;mage to this Kingdom to purchase Sugar at <IT>Martinico</IT>, especially with Money. I will sup&rehy;pose that an <IT>English</IT> Ship hath delivered a Car&rehy;goe in <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, for which her Merchant hath received 4000 Pounds; Sugars are so dear at <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, he will rather bring the Money home to <IT>England</IT>, than lay it out in a Commo&rehy;dity, when he apprehends that he shall lose by it; therefore so much Cash which, I will sup<PB
N="20">pose, comes safe home, adds to the Kingdom 4000 Pounds. Another Ship and Man I will suppose under the same Circumstances at <IT>Bar&rehy;badoes</IT>; but being informed that Sugars are cheap at <IT>Martinico</IT>, with his 4000 Pounds goes thither and purchases Sugars; which as he can&rehy;not come to <IT>England</IT> with directly, he carries to <IT>Holland</IT>, where Sugars are never much dearer, or much cheaper than in <IT>England</IT>. I will ony suppose in this Case, that he bought his Sugars 10 <IT>per Cent.</IT> cheaper than he could have done at <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, which will be suffici&rehy;ent to pay Freight: When in <IT>Holland</IT> he finds, after deducting 10 <IT>per Cent.</IT> which will pay his Wages, and Wear and Tear for his whole Voyage, he has just 4000 Pounds left, which he brings to <IT>London</IT>. Pray, who maintained this Ship the whole Voyage? Certainly the <IT>Dutch</IT>. And who the other, but the <IT>English</IT>?</P>
<P>When I see and hear Propositions which are self evident, controverted and denied, and Im&rehy;possibilities advanced for Truths. When a Gen&rehy;tleman tells Mr. <IT>Britain</IT> there are two Places between the Tropics equally distant from your Kingdom, one is inhabited by Mr. <IT>French</IT>, and the other by Mr. <IT>English</IT>; they produce the same Commodities, and equal in Goodness. I know you have taken off all Mr. <IT>English's</IT> Pro&rehy;duce for many Years, and when you have had more than for your own Use, you supplied Mr. <IT>Holland</IT>, who, I have heard you say, paid you very honourably; and that you gained very <PB
N="21">well by him, he having paid the whole Char&rehy;ges you were at in bringing home, and carry&rehy;ing to him such Produce, which maintained a very great Number of your People very hand&rehy;somly. Mr. <IT>French</IT> hath offered to sell you his Produce 30 <IT>per Cent.</IT> cheaper than Mr. <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> does, and you may send it to Mr. <IT>Holland</IT> more directly than you used to do, nay for a great deal less Charge and Expence; and tho' I know he would give you just as much for one as the other, you had better take Mr. <IT>English's</IT>: Tho' I allow, Mr. <IT>Britain</IT>, you might get 40 <IT>per Cent.</IT> more in one Case than the other; yet it is your Interest to trade with Mr. <IT>English</IT> only, tho' you might get more by 40 <IT>per Cent.</IT> by Mr. <IT>French</IT>, and take off all Mr. <IT>English's</IT> Goods beside. This, I say, hath been main&rehy;tained, and it remains a Doubt with some, as they say, whether Mr. <IT>Britain</IT> ought not to do as he is advised; tho' at the same Time too he is well assured that Mr. <IT>French</IT> designs to un&rehy;dertake that Business himself, and will, in that Case, be always able to undersell him, with Mr. <IT>Holland</IT>. Yes, there are People who say that Mr. <IT>Britain</IT> should not take any of those Advantages offered by Mr. <IT>French</IT>, tho' the Thing is demonstrable, that if he doth not, he will, in a little Time, lose all his Business with Mr. <IT>Holland</IT>, and be in Danger of wanting such Goods for his own Use and Consumption. What would any one think of Mr. <IT>Britain</IT>, if by such fine Argument he was persuaded to <PB
N="22">take their Advice? Why, that he was a Fool, or a Dotard. Yet this is all that they have to say.</P>
<P>I have so plainly shewn how the <IT>French</IT> have been supplied with Lumber and Cattle, that I persuade myself, that no Person ac&rehy;quainted in the least with that Part of the Globe, and the Trade thereof, will say, that any Thing which I have advanced, with Regard to their being supplied, for the future, from the Places, and in the Manner I have mentioned, either impracticable, or so much as improbable. I have set forth the Danger of our putting them under the Necessity of improving their Settlements in the Bay of <IT>Apalachy</IT> and <IT>Mississipi</IT>; how dangerous the Encrease of their Shipping and Navigation will be to us; the real Damage it will be to us, to lose the Employment of all the Ship&rehy;ping which we now employ in that Trade; or, what might be as properly said, lose the Employment of Twelve or Fifteen Thousand Tons of our Shipping, which the <IT>French</IT> now pay us for. Is there any one will say that they do not? That would be as absurd as to deny, that <IT>Spain</IT> doth employ an <IT>English</IT> Ship, in the following Case: Sen. <IT>Don Diego Cadiz</IT> acquaints Mr. <IT>John London</IT>, that he wants Long-Ells, Broad-Cloth, Druggets, Calli&rehy;mancoes, Bays, Fish, Tin, Lead, Wheat, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> to the Quantity of 500 Tons; and lets him know what Commodities he proposes to pay him with, namely, Wine, Oyl, Cochineal, <PB
N="23">Wool, and Pistoles, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> We are to suppose, Mr. <IT>London</IT> knows the Price current of all these Commodities, in <IT>Spain</IT> as well as in <IT>England</IT>; and seeing there's a great Probabi&rehy;lity of Advantage and Gain to be made, he sends a Ship of proper Burthen, for which, as it is his own Ship, he charges 30 Shil&rehy;lings <IT>per</IT> Ton Out, and as much Home. When the <IT>Spanish</IT> Cargoe arrives here, and is dis&rehy;posed of, he finds, after Freight, Commissi&rehy;ons, and all other Charges are paid and al&rehy;lowed, he hath neither gained or lost by the Neat Proceeds of this Voyage: But the Freight, tho' it may not be called all clear Profit (yet, supposing and allowing the Maintenance of all the Men which mann'd the Ship, and the Wear and Tear of the Ship included, in the constant Expence of our Nation) I say, that whole Freight would be clear Gains to he Kingdom, <IT>viz.</IT> Fifteen Hundred Pounds, which undoubtedly we received from <IT>Spain</IT>. Hence <IT>Spain</IT> may be properly said to have employ'd an <IT>English</IT> Ship: Whereas, if just the contrary had happened, that <IT>Spain</IT> had been the Carrier and Adventurer, had not we paid them the Fifteen Hundred Pounds.</P>
<P>I will now suppose, that the Gentlemen of our Sugar-Colonies were indulged, and that a Restraint was laid upon all our Shipping trading to the <IT>French</IT> Colonies, on any Pre&rehy;tence whatever. If the <IT>French</IT> could produce as much Sugar as they used to do, and send <PB
N="24">it all to <IT>Europe</IT>, which, I think, no Body will doubt would be the Case; and that they would send just as much more than they used to do, as our <IT>Northern</IT> Colonies took from them, and consequently encrease their Shipping on that Score too; they would, in that Case, influence the Markets, or Price of Sugars in <IT>England</IT>, just as they have hitherto done: For I will defy any Regulation in <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, or our Plantations, to persuade <IT>Ham&rehy;bourgh, Amsterdam</IT>, or <IT>Cadiz</IT>, to give us more Money for our Sugars, than they will give the <IT>French</IT> for theirs, while equal in Goodness. Hence, while our Sugar-Colonies produced any Quantity of Sugars more than these King&rehy;doms and our own Plantations in <IT>America</IT> consumed, the Prices of Sugar in <IT>Europe</IT> would not be affected thereby, and consequently not in these Kingdoms, because there is so near a Proportion in the Prices of all Commodities between us and our trading Neighbours: And so far, I confess, I am not able to perceive any Advantages these Gentlemen propose, ei&rehy;ther to themselves, or to this Kingdom. As far be it from me to suppose they imagine, that as the Consumption of that Commodity is so much encreased in these three Kingdoms, and the Northern Colonies in <IT>America</IT>, that, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">communibus annis</FOREIGN></IT>, we might take off, or be in Want of all that they produced, for our own Use. In that Case, they would have it in their Power to make us pay them their <PB
N="25">own Price, or be under the Necessity of buy&rehy;ing from the <IT>French</IT> in <IT>Europe</IT>; for when we have no other Market to go to, may they not serve us just as a famous trading People are reported to serve the World? That is, they let them have just as much Spice as they per&rehy;ceive they consume in Proportion to the De&rehy;mand of the Consumers: If they have great Quantities remaining, they will rather burn and destroy them, than sell under what they themselves call a good Price. I say, I would not so much as suggest that any Gentlemen could have any such Design; but I would reckon and esteem those People extreamly weak and imprudent, who put it in the Pow&rehy;er of any Body, or Colonies of People, to serve them so; and more especially when they, the Parties, seem'd so sollicitous about it them&rehy;selves. The Northern Colonies would be un&rehy;der the Necessity of paying them whatever they demanded for their Sugar, or be obliged to send to <IT>Europe</IT> for all that they wanted: And tho' those very Colonies took from our own Sugar Islands all the Rum and Molosses they produced, and tho' one Town in one of those Colonies took at least Ten Thousand Tons of Rum and Molosses, the Produce of one <IT>French</IT> Island, namely, <IT>Martinico</IT>, together with the vast Quantities of the same Commo&rehy;dities that were the Produce of <IT>Surinam, Guienne, Guadalupe, Granado, Cape Fran&ccedil;ois</IT>, <PB
N="26">&amp;c. that were imported there, and to all the other Colonies, all of which was but equal to their Consumption and Demand; yet these People in the Northern Colonies, in this Case would, according to the Opinion of those Gentlemen, be deprived of above one Half of those Commodities, which, by such long Use, are become absolutely necessary for them, in carrying on their <IT>Indian</IT> Trade and Fishe&rehy;ries, two of the most valuable and profitable Trades to this Kingdom, beside what is used in those Plantations where they produce Rice, Pitch and Tar, Tobacco, Wheat, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> in all which, it is the Interest of this Kingdom that they be produced so cheap, that we may sup&rehy;ply other Nations with those Commodities, whereby this Kingdom will reap the whole Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P>Now, as the Gentlemen of the Islands would have these People in the Northern Colonies en&rehy;tirely dependent on them, and as they are sure they can have none of these Things from any o&rehy;ther Quarter, might there not be some Danger, if these Gentlemen were not Men of nice Ho&rehy;nour, that they would make the Northern People pay extravagant Prices, perhaps twice as much as they now do, which might entirely destroy the most profitable Trades we now carry on? I will defy any Person to prove that such a Restriction could have any other Effect, than to enrich the People of our Sugar-Colonies <PB
N="27">at the Expence and Loss of the Trade of this Kingdom, and the Destruction of some, if not many of our Northern Trades and Colo&rehy;nies. What these Gentlemen have done to raise such Expectations as they seem to be pos&rehy;sess'd with, I cannot imagine; but whatever Kindness may be intended them, I hope that the People in the Northern Colonies, who are as useful Subjects, will not be distressed, to aggrandize the most wealthy, most opulent, and gayest People in His Majesty's Domini&rehy;ons, even very few about his Courts excepted; nor the Publick Revenue lessened, nor our Trade contracted, to encrease that of our greatest Rivals, while we have or inherit the Name of <IT>Britons</IT>.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of <IT>Barbadoes</IT> could not per&rehy;haps have taken a more improper Time to complain of any Hardships, as they have im&rehy;ported no less into the Port of <IT>London</IT> in the Year 1730. than 17077 Hogsheads and 256 Barrels of Sugar from that Island only, beside the Quantity imported to the Out-Ports, which I will only allow to be one Third of the Hogs&rehy;heads imported to <IT>London, viz.</IT> 5692 Hogs&rehy;heads, in all 22769 Hogsheads, each Hogshead Weight in <IT>Barbadoes</IT> 13 Hund will amount to 295997 Hund. which at 1<IT>l.</IT> 3<IT>s.</IT> <IT>per</IT> Hund. in <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, must amount to 340391<IT>l.</IT> 11<IT>s.</IT> no inconsiderable Sum, when we consider the Smallness of that Island, which is not much <PB
N="28">bigger than the <IT>Isle of Wight</IT>, and the Num&rehy;ber of People (which the Gentlemen of that Island assure us are very few) amongst whom this Sum is to be divided. But when we con&rehy;sider that all this is clear Profit, because those very Gentlemen have already proved before the <IT>Honourable Committee</IT>, that the Rum and Mo&rehy;losses pays all the Charges of the Plantation; and if we farther allow what we reasonably may, that but one twentieth Part of their Su&rehy;gar was taken off their Hands by the Northern Colonies, the whole Amount of their Profits in the Year 1730. only, comes to 360306<IT>l.</IT> 18<IT>s.</IT> a Sum so prodigious when considered as clear Profit, that it may seem incredible whenever it shall be related, that a few People (very few as they themselves say) were so bad Oeco&rehy;nomists, that they could not live upon such a mighty Income, but petitioned like People in Distress and under the greatest Calamities, for the Means of getting more, from a People unac&rehy;quainted with their Luxury and Excess, from a People who work and labour hard for their Liv&rehy;ing, from a People who have but few, if any Slaves, who inhabit Soils less fruitful, who are obliged to be Oeconomists or starve. Yes, such has been the monstrous Effect of the Luxury and bad Oeconomy of some People, that they have been intoxicated to so great a Degree as to persuade themselves, that for only asking they could oblige those who used not only to take all the Commodities they produced off their Hands, <PB
N="29">but were under the Necessity of taking from others to supply themselves, not to take for the future any such Commodity from any other, whereby they might be capable of making them pay double the Price for all Things which they produced, and the other wanted; the real Consequence of which would be, that the People on our Sugar Islands would get more Money for their Rum and Molosses and Sugar than they used to do. But who would they get it from? Either from our Northern Colonies, or <IT>England</IT>, or both. If that be the Case, as it undoubtedly is, how shall we be a&rehy;ble when they have advanced upon us, to supply those Markets we now sup&rehy;ply so cheap? But if we are by this Means to have no more than will just supply our selves and the Nor&rehy;thern Colonies, where will the Advantage be to this Kingdom to pay more for their own Consumption? Or what Reason can be given why we should oblige the Northern Co&rehy;lonies to pay more for their Consumption, which in Effect would be taking from the Northern Colonies to give to the Sugar Colonies; none of which could tend to increase the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom, but on the con&rehy;trary that Number of Men and Quantity of Shipping now employed to the <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT> Sugar Islands (supposing all other Trades sufficiently supplied) would be useless; the King and this Kingdom would lose the Duty, <PB
N="30">Custom and Excise of a proportionable Quan&rehy;tity of these Commodities, as there could not possibly be so much imported here.</P>
<P>From what hath been said, I would persuade myself that few who read this will want to be convinced, as I really am, that there is no Oc&rehy;casion for any other Regulation in this Trade than that which I proposed about permitting our Sugar Colonies to carry their clay'd Sugar directly to any Part of <IT>Europe</IT> South of <IT>Cape Finisterre</IT>: And if a small Duty not exceeding 5<IT>l. per Cent.</IT> were laid on all <IT>French</IT> Goods per&rehy;mitted to be imported into any of our Colo&rehy;nies, and that Money so arising which I would have applied as a Bounty for the sending of Hemp and Flax from them to us: I say such a Duty upon <IT>French</IT> Goods, together with the Bribes given to Governours, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> could not make them be afforded cheaper than our own, unless the <IT>French</IT> could produce much cheaper than our People; and if the last be the Case, we must not long think to supply those Mar&rehy;kets, which they can as conveniently do. We have all Sorts of Materials for carrying on of such Business cheaper than the <IT>French</IT>; name&rehy;ly, Slaves, Provisions, all Manner of Plantati&rehy;on Utensils, Cattle and Lumber; and as we na&rehy;vigate cheaper, our Islands can send their Goods cheaper to Market than any other People can. Is it not owing to our producing Tobacco so cheap, that we sell above 30000 Hogsheads <PB
N="31">every Year over and above our own Consump&rehy;tion? What is this owing to? Not the Excel&rehy;lence of the Commodity only: Other Countries produce Tobacco which will sell for more Mo&rehy;ney; but we produce so cheap, and navigate so cheap, that I have great Reason to think if we go on but a little while longer at the low Price it hath held at for some few Years past, that o&rehy;ther People will drop that Produce, and we may do in Tobacco what we once did in Sugar, namely, beat out all others, and make them decline the Production of that Commodity; this being once accomplished, as there is some Hopes, the Tobacco Trade will again flou&rehy;rish.</P>
<P>I have Reason to be of Mr. <IT>Gee's</IT> Opinion, who says <IT>Page</IT> 45, in his Book of the Trade and Navigation of <IT>Great-Britain</IT> considered: <Q>"Our Planters are so far from being concern&rehy;ed at the Decay of our foreign Trade, that they have complained too many Sugars were made; and we may conclude will make what Interest they can with their Governors and others, to prevent their making and settling any new Plantations: If they can supply e&rehy;nough for Home Consumption at a great Price, it answers their Purpose. The Island of <IT>Barbadoes</IT> is very much worn out, and does not afford the Quantity of Sugars as heretofore; and yet the Planters live in great Splendor, and at vast Expence, while the <PB
N="32"><IT>French</IT>, under the Remembrance of their Poverty on their first Settlement at <IT>Hispa&rehy;niola</IT>, continue to live very frugally, and by their Labour, Industry and Fertility of their Soil, are able to undersell us. The only Places we can think of where we may enlarge our Sugar Plantations are <IT>Tobago</IT>."</Q> To which I would add too the Island of <IT>Santa Cruz</IT>, which is equal to it at least. The whole Chapter whence I extracted this Part I think deserves as much Consideration as any Part of his whole Book, wherein is contained many just Observations on Trade; and tho' I cannot be of Opinion with him, that the south Parts of <IT>Carolina</IT> and the <IT>Bahama</IT> Islands are proper Places for Sugar, because I have been acquain&rehy;ted with the Success of several Experiments there, yet I think the farther settling of the Island of <IT>Jamaica</IT> to be of the highest Conse&rehy;quence to this Kingdom, which if we neg&rehy;lect, we shall be in Danger to be beat quite out of all foreign Trade by the <IT>French</IT>: And by that Means the Planters, who shall then re&rehy;main in our Islands, may make us pay just what they please for their Produce, which seems to be their only Aim by the Petition.</P>
<P>The Remonstrance of these Gentlemen, with Regard to our Northern Colonies, taking and using <IT>French</IT> Silks and <IT>French</IT> Linnens, looks as if they were resolved to render them as odi&rehy;ous to this Kingdom, as they already are to <PB
N="33">the Gentlemen of our Islands. As in all In&rehy;formations where the Prosecutor is principally concerned in the Consequence, it is generally known, that as far as his own Word will be taken, he seldom fails of making out all he complained of; but by the Happiness of our Constitution, we very often have the Chance of obtaining an impartial Jury, who are to be Judges of Facts, as well as the Credibility of Evidence. Now if a declared Enemy will come and tell a Jury, "Gentlemen, the Peo&rehy;ple in the Northern Colonies in <IT>America</IT> wear principally <IT>French</IT> Silks and Linnens; though they can have Silks and Sattins, Callicoes and Muslins, of the Manufacture of <IT>India</IT>, at least 30, if not 50 <IT>per Cent.</IT> cheaper than they can have the <IT>French</IT> Goods: Nay so fond are they of <IT>French</IT> Lin&rehy;nen, tho' they make Linnen worth 7<IT>s. per</IT> Ell themselves, that they will wear only <IT>French</IT> Linnen". Now what impartial Jury, who knew <IT>New-England-Men</IT> especially, could believe this? A Place where the richest Men follow Busi&rehy;ness closely, where Industry is principally re&rehy;garded, where the Luxurious and Effeminate are discountenanced; a Place generally hated by the riotous and debauched Part of Men, because of their rigorous Laws and Customs; a People parsimonious to a Proverb: I say, were this to be related to a Jury of their Vicinage, they might think too much was <PB
N="34">proved, and shake their Heads at the Infor&rehy;mer. If any of these Gentlemen will acquaint the Legislature with any more effectual Means to prevent the Consumption of any foreign Manufactures, either here or in our own Plan&rehy;tations, or shew that sufficient Care is not al&rehy;ready taken to prevent such Abuses, as far as the Reason and Nature of the Thing requires, he may do a real Service to this Kingdom, and will then truly deserve the Thanks of every <IT>Briton</IT>.</P>
