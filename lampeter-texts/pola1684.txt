<PB N="[i]"><DIV TYPE="address"><HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic;N the Year 1594. the Je&rehy;suit PARSONS published <IT>a Conference</IT> under the name of <IT>DOLEMAN</IT>. The Design of which <IT>Pamphlet</IT>, as e&rehy;very one knows, was to promote <IT>a Bill of Exclusion</IT> against King JAMES.
</P><P>And though the Jesuites malice was herein defeated, as to the Per&rehy;son of that <IT>King</IT>; yet how much it influenc'd the Sufferings of his <IT>late Majesty</IT>, is a sad story to re&rehy;peat. For he who shall peruse the many virulent <IT>Libels</IT>, which first occasion'd, and then fomented that <PB
N="[ii]">unnatural <IT>Rebellion</IT>; he will ea&rehy;sily be instructed how that <IT>Confe&rehy;rence</IT> was Transcribed and Tran&rehy;sprosed by the <IT>Patrons</IT> of the <IT>Fa&rehy;ction</IT>: And to speak in our Mo&rehy;dern Language, he cannot but observe, That the <IT>Popish DOLE&rehy;MAN</IT> is the Oracle of the <IT>TRUE-PROTESTANT</IT> Party.</P>
<P>Now that this may not be re&rehy;jected as a slandering Design, on&rehy;ly to make them odious to Au&rehy;thority, as is commonly Object&rehy;ed; I have here drawn for the Readers satisfaction, a short PA&rehy;RALLEL between <IT>Doleman, Bradshaw, Sidney</IT> and some o&rehy;thers. Upon perusal of which it will plainly appear, that the <PB
N="[iii]">Jesuites Principles, as managed by <IT>Bradshaw</IT> and the <IT>Regicides</IT>, did cut off the Head of King CHARLES the first.</P>
<P>And since the same Principles have been transcribed by the <IT>Bre&rehy;thren</IT> of the <IT>ASSOCIATION</IT>; we have just reason to suspect the same <IT>Practices</IT> likewise: And that those who defend the Murder of King <IT>CHARLES</IT> the first, would doubtless, <IT>if they had Power in their Hands</IT>, Depose and Mur&rehy;der King <IT>CHARLES</IT> the Second.</P>
<P>If any <IT>Republican</IT> shall think fit to doubt that the following Dis&rehy;course is either <IT>Partial</IT> or <IT>Uncon&rehy;cluding, i.e.</IT> that I have either said something that is <IT>false</IT>, or else have omitted in any Instance, the <PB
N="[iv]">very <IT>Strength</IT> of their <IT>Cause</IT>, let him make known his Grievance. And I do here faithfully promise, upon such notice given, I will (through Divine Assistance) en&rehy;deavour his Satisfaction.</P>

<P>&Aic;Lthough the <IT>Kings</IT> Title to his <IT>Crown</IT> and Dignity, together with his just Right and Authority, <IT>over all Persons and in all Causes</IT>, are beyond Ex&rehy;ception establish'd, by the Ordinance of God, and the known Laws and Constitu&rehy;tions of these Kingdoms; yet so far hath <IT>Prejudice</IT>, or something worse, prevail'd with some Men (and those not of the mea&rehy;nest Rank) as to suffer themselves to be led into a Belief.
<PB N="2"></P><P><IT>That the Original of all Government is from the People</IT>; and that the Power which <IT>Kings</IT> and Princes have, was derived unto them from the <IT>People</IT> by way of <IT>Pact</IT> or <IT>Contract</IT>. Particularly, That the King of <IT>England</IT> (as appears from his <IT>Coronation&rehy;Oath</IT>) having solemnly engaged to his Peo&rehy;ple, to maintain Religion, to execute Justice, and to keep the Laws and right&rehy;ful Customs of the Kingdom; upon these Conditions was admitted to the Kingly Power. The which Conditions if he shall omit to observe (and of this they them&rehy;selves will be Judges) they then fancy, that he hath forfeited his <IT>Crown</IT>; and that the <IT>People</IT> who first made him <IT>King</IT> may, by their <IT>Representatives</IT> in Parliament, de&rehy;throne and <IT>Depose</IT> him.
</P><P>That this is the Scheme of some Mens Policy, the many Treasonable Papers, such as, <IT>The Association, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Vox Populi</FOREIGN>, Appeal to the City, Coll.</IT> SIDNEY'S Papers, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> together with the late <IT>horrid Conspiracy</IT> groun&rehy;ded thereupon, do sufficiently demon&rehy;strate.</P>
<P>And therefore I hope it will be no un&rehy;seasonable <IT>Undertaking</IT>; but may, through <PB
N="3" ID="pa5.p3">Gods Blessing, contribute somewhat to se&rehy;cure the King's <IT>Liege-People</IT> in their due O&rehy;bedience, whilst I endeavour to evince the Falseness and destructive Consequences of these <IT>Anti-monarchical</IT> Principles.</P>
<P>Which that I may the more effectually, and with the greater clearness perform, I shall first lay down the utmost Strength of their Cause in one intire <IT>Objection</IT>, and then endeavour their satisfaction in the fol&rehy;lowing <IT>Answer</IT>.</P>
<P>OBJECTION.</P>
<P REND="it">THE Government of England is a mixt Monarchy, consisting of <GO>Three Estates</GO> King, Lords and Commons: And therefore the King of <RO>England</RO> is not an Absolute, but a li&rehy;mited Monarch; and as Such is to govern by, and according to, the Laws of the Land, and not o&rehy;therwise: And by the Oath which he hath taken at his Coronation, he is obliged to use the Power, Trust and Office then committed to him, for the Good and Benefit of the <RO>People</RO>, and for the preservation of their Rights and Liber&rehy;ties.
<PB N="4"></P><P REND="it">Now if the King, thus entrusted to keep the <RO>Laws</RO>, and preserve <RO>Religion</RO>, should be guil&rehy;ty of a wicked Design, to subvert our <RO>Laws</RO>, and destroy our <RO>Religion</RO>, by introducing an ar&rehy;bitrary, Tyrannical Government; he must then understand, that he is but an Officer of Trust: And the <RO>Parliament</RO> of <RO>England</RO> (the Repre&rehy;sentatives of the <RO>People</RO>, in whom all Power doth originally reside) they are to take order for the A&rehy;nimadversion and Punishment of such an offend&rehy;ing Governor. <RO>Parliaments</RO> were ordain'd to restrain the exorbitant Power of <RO>Kings</RO>, and to redress the Grievances of the <RO>People</RO>.
</P><P REND="it">It is very true, what some have said, <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Rex non habet parem in Regno</FOREIGN>. But this is to be understood in a limited Sense: For though <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">ma&rehy;jor singulis</FOREIGN>, yet he is <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">minor universis</FOREIGN>. This we know to be <RO>Law</RO>, from that famous <RO>Lawyer BRACTON</RO>: <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Rex habet Superiorem, Deum & Legem, etiam & Curiam</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>Which is thus Interpreted by Mr. SIDNEY.</P>
<P REND="it">For this Reason <RO>Bracton</RO> saith; That the <RO>King</RO> hath Three Superiors, to wit, <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Deum, Legem & Parliamentum</FOREIGN>; That is, The Power originally in the <RO>People</RO> of <RO>England</RO>, is delegated unto the <RO>Parliament. SIDNEY'S</RO> Tryal, pag. 23.</P>
<PB N="5" ID="pa5.p5"><P>That is, as I conceive, the <IT>Sum</IT> of all that <IT>hath</IT> been, and the utmost of what, I suppose, <IT>can</IT> be said in this matter. To which I return this
</P><P>ANSWER.</P>
<P>&Tic;HAT this Phrase a <IT>mixt Monarchy</IT>, though somewhat frequent in the Mouths of these Men, is yet no very plain or intelligible Expression.
</P><P>For, if by a <IT>mixt Monarchy</IT>, they design such a Government, wherein though the <IT>Surpream</IT> Power may reside in one <IT>single</IT> Person, yet the Monarch is so limited in the Execution of that Power, that he cannot legally perform several Acts of Soveraignty without the Concurrence of his Subjects (as with us here in <IT>England</IT>, the King neither makes LAWS, nor doth raise <IT>Taxes</IT> without his <IT>Parliament</IT>) If this be the utmost they design, when they call <IT>England a mixt Monarchy</IT>; then, though the Expression is very improper (an <IT>arrand Bull</IT>, a flat Contradiction <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in adjecto</FOREIGN>) yet where we are agreed in the <IT>Thing</IT>, we shall not contend about <IT>VVords</IT>; but may safely <PB
N="6" ID="pa5.p6">grant, that in this Sense, as now explain'd, <IT>The Government of England is a mixt Mo&rehy;narchy</IT>.</P>
<P>But if by a <IT>mixt</IT> they denote such a <IT>Monarchy</IT>, wherein though the Style and Title of King, together with some Ce&rehy;remonious Appendices of Royalty, as <IT>Cap</IT> and <IT>Knee, Guards</IT>, &amp;c. are indeed inve&rehy;sted in One single Person, yet the <IT>Supreme Power</IT> and <IT>Soveraignty</IT> is not solely and in&rehy;tirely in the <IT>Monarch</IT>, exclusively to all others (as with us here in <IT>England</IT>, say these Men, the Soveraignty by way of <IT>Coordination</IT>, is partly in the <IT>King</IT>, partly in the <IT>Lords</IT>, and partly in the <IT>Commons</IT>, and for this reason they are styled the <GO>Three Estates</GO> of the Kingdom) if this be their Notion of a <IT>mixt Monarchy</IT> (as most plain&rehy;ly it is, if <IT>Actions</IT> may interpret <IT>Intentions</IT>) it is then not only false and absurd, but dangerous and destructive. And there&rehy;fore in this Sense we do peremptorily de&rehy;ny; <IT>That the Government of England is a mixt Monarchy</IT>.</P>
<P>For, <IT>The</IT> Supreme Power <IT>is solely in the</IT> King; <IT>and consequently the</IT> King <IT>is not, by way of Coordination, One of the</IT> <GO>Three Estates</GO>, <PB
N="7"><IT>but the</IT> HEAD <IT>and</IT> Soveraign <IT>of them all</IT>.</P>
<P>In order to this Conviction, the <IT>Dissent&rehy;ing Republican</IT>, who denyes this Truth, may please to consider,</P>
<P>That he who shall desire to inform himself rightly, where the <IT>Supreme</IT> Pow&rehy;er in any <IT>Government</IT> is plac'd; as also by whom, how and how far such <IT>Power</IT> hath from time to time, been either <IT>exercis'd</IT> or <IT>restrain'd</IT>; he must of necessity have re&rehy;course to the <IT>Publick Laws</IT> and <IT>Constitutions</IT> of such Government. Particularly here in <IT>England</IT>, he who designs to be truly in&rehy;structed in this matter; he must not re&rehy;ceive his notice from the Discourses of <IT>private</IT> men (which are many times fallaci&rehy;ous, partial and uncertain) but he ought to consult the Known Laws and Statutes those <IT>Authentick Records</IT> of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now the <IT>Oath of Supremacy</IT>, establish'd by several Parliaments, doth expresly De&rehy;clare; <IT>That the Kings Highness is the only Su&rehy;preme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highness Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Things or Causes, as Temporal</IT>.</P>
<PB N="8"><P>Words as plain and intelligible as the Wit of Man could devise.
</P><P>From whence 'tis obvious to make this Inference;</P>
<P>That if the King is <IT>Supream</IT>, then he hath no <IT>Superior</IT>; if <IT>only</IT> Supream, then no <IT>equal</IT>. If <IT>over all</IT> Persons (and as such the <IT>55th. Canon</IT> enjoyns us to acknowledg him in our Prayers) then <IT>All</IT> Persons in these his Realms, and all other his Dominions and Countries, are <IT>subordinate</IT> or <IT>Subject</IT> un&rehy;to him, and if <IT>subordinate</IT>, then none of them, either <IT>severally</IT> or <IT>joyntly</IT> are <IT>coordinate</IT> with him.</P>
<P>Now is it possible, after so plain and express a Determination, for any Man to doubt; <IT>That the Supream Power is solely in the King</IT>? I observe it is possible: For, some Men who will not be satisfy'd with Rea&rehy;son, do thus urge.</P>
<P>That the Oath of <IT>Supremacy</IT>, being ex&rehy;presly levell'd against the Usurpations of the <IT>Church</IT> of <IT>Rome</IT>, was consequently so fram'd as to discover those who are <IT>Po&rehy;pishly</IT> affected.</P>
<P>For, the Persons taking that Oath are obliged only to Declare; That they Re<PB
N="9">nounce all Foreign Jurisdictions: <IT>i.e.</IT> They do swear; That the <IT>King</IT> of <IT>England</IT> is no Feudatory Prince, and that he holds not his <IT>Crown</IT> in <IT>Fee</IT>, either from the <IT>Pope</IT>, or any <IT>Foraign</IT> Power whatsoever. But what is all this, say these men, to the <IT>Parliament</IT>? Or, how come this Oath to be urg'd a&rehy;gainst the Jurisdiction of the <IT>two Houses</IT>? Since in those very Statutes in which this Oath is enjoyn'd, the <IT>Legislative</IT> Power (which doubtless is the <IT>Supream</IT> Power) is expresly Established in the <IT>Parliament</IT>, as well as in the <IT>King</IT>, in these Words.</P>
<P REND="it">Be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this present Parliament assem&rehy;bled, and by the Authority of the same.</P>
<P>Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons do <IT>Enact</IT> joyntly with the King, and therefore have a <IT>Coordinate Power</IT>.</P>
<P>To which it is thus Reply'd.</P>
<P>That when this Oath of <IT>Supremacy</IT> was first framed, the <IT>Pope</IT> being then the most noted Usurper, was for that reason more particularly mention'd than any other; but from thence to infer.</P>
<P>That it was design'd, by way of <IT>Test</IT>, <PB N="10">to discover <IT>Those</IT>, who are <IT>Popishly-affe&rehy;cted</IT>, is a very great Mistake.</P>
<P>For, the Supremacy of the Kings of <IT>England</IT>, being the chief <IT>Prerogative</IT> of the <IT>Crown</IT>, was always challeng'd and main&rehy;tain'd by <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin">V. 27. Ed. 3. c. 1. 3 R. 2. c. 3. 7 R. 2. c. 12. 16 R. 2. c. 5. 2 H. 4. c. 4. 6 H. 4. c. 1. 24 H. 8. c. 12. 25 H 8. c. 19. 26 H. 8. c. 1. 37 H. 8 c. 17. Parl. 2. l. Mar. c. 1.</NOTE> <IT>Popish</IT> Princes as well as <IT>Pro&rehy;testant</IT>, <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin">1 Eliz. c. 1. 5 Eliz. c. 1. 13 E&rehy;liz. c. 2.</NOTE> as appears by these several <IT>Statutes</IT> here mention'd in the <IT>Margent</IT>.</P>
<P>The Intent then of this Oath was not to discover who are <IT>Papists</IT>, but in plain Terms, who are <IT>Traitors</IT>: And therefore let Mens Pretences to Religion be other&rehy;wise what they will; if by scrupling this <IT>Oath</IT>, they refuse to give assurance to the <IT>Government</IT>, that they will be honest and loyal, they are to be esteem'd, if not <IT>Traitors</IT>, yet at least <IT>Trayterously</IT> affe&rehy;cted.</P>
<P>And whereas they further urge, That the <IT>Coordinate</IT> Power of the <IT>Parliament</IT> is no way condemn'd by this Oath; which on&rehy;ly takes notice of a <IT>Foraign</IT> Usurpation; They are for their satisfaction, desired to consider,</P>
<P>That, since <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">rectum est Judex sui & obliqui</FOREIGN>, Domestick Usurpation is hereby excluded as well as Foreign: The Soveraignty of <PB
N="11">the <IT>People</IT> as well as of the <IT>Pope</IT>.</P>
<P>And as to that which is pleaded from the Form of the Statute, <IT>by the Authority of the same</IT>, as if the <IT>Lords</IT> and <IT>Commons</IT> did by <IT>their</IT> Authority, make and enact Laws joyntly with the King; To this I do hum&rehy;bly Answer, That this Expression, if du&rehy;ly consider'd, doth not in the least favour the <IT>Republican</IT> Fancy of a <IT>Coordinate</IT> Pow&rehy;er.</P>
<P>Which I shall best express to <IT>vulgar</IT> Capacities (for whom this Discourse is chiefly design'd) thus faithfully by repre&rehy;senting the Matter of <IT>Fact</IT>.</P>
<P>Although the <IT>Legislative</IT> Power is <IT>solely</IT> in the King, yet His <IT>Majesty</IT> doth not make Laws, without the concurring Advice and Approbation of his Subjects: For the King, like other Men, being mortal and of limited Capacity, is neither <IT>omniscient</IT> nor <IT>omnipresent</IT>. He cannot be in all Parts of his Dominions at one and the same time, and consequently can no otherwise be acquainted with the Grievances of his Subjects, but by the Reports of o&rehy;thers.</P>
<P>To supply this Defect, he calls whom <PB N="12">he pleaseth (such as he thinks able and faithful to assist and direct him) to be of his <IT>Privy Councel</IT>; whose advice he takes in the Execution of those Laws which are already Establish'd.</P>
<P>But since all human Laws are liable to Defects (for it is the sole <IT>Prerogative</IT> of Gods Law, as being the result of Infinite Wis&rehy;dom and Goodness, to be <IT>exceeding broad</IT>; to be fitted to all times, and to answer all occasions) it is therefore sometimes neces&rehy;sary that <IT>new</IT> Laws should be made, and the <IT>old</IT> ones either abrogated and null'd; or else reinforc'd with greater Penalties.</P>
<P>In such Cases, according to the happy Constitution of these <IT>Nations</IT>, the King summons his <IT>Great Council</IT>; the High and most Honourable Court of Parliament; The <IT>Lords Spiritual</IT>, the <IT>Lords Temporal</IT> and the <IT>Commons</IT>; Representing the <IT>Three Estates</IT> of the Kingdom; Who coming from all Parts of the Nation, are best able to in&rehy;form His Majesty of the Grievances of his Subjects; and by what Ways and Me&rehy;thods they may most suitably be re&rehy;dress'd.</P>
<P>In order hereunto; when any Proposal, <PB N="13">or as we phrase it any <IT>Bill</IT>, hath pass'd the Approbation of the <IT>Two Houses</IT>; it is then humbly presented to the <IT>King</IT> for his <IT>Royal Assent</IT>. Which if His Majesty thinks fit to grant, then <FOREIGN
REND="go" LANG="FRA">Le Roy le veult</FOREIGN>, makes it a Law: But if the King shall dislike the Bill, he then rejects it, with a <FOREIGN
REND="go" LANG="FRA">Le Roy ne veult</FOREIGN>, the King will not pass it; or else in that more obliging Form of Denyal, <FOREIGN
REND="go" LANG="FRA">Le Roy avisera</FOREIGN>, the King will consider or advise about it.</P>
<P>This is the plain matter of Fact. From whence 'tis very easie to understand, what this Form of words, <IT>By the Authority of the same</IT> doth import, <IT>viz.</IT> not of the <IT>same Lords and Commons</IT> (as if either <IT>Lords</IT> or <IT>Commons</IT> had an Authority contradistinct from, or coordinate with, the <IT>King</IT>) but by the Authority of the <IT>same Parliament</IT>.</P>
<P>The which <IT>Parliament</IT>, as Sir <IT>Edw. Cooke</IT> <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin">Instit. part 4. Cap. 1. p. 1.</NOTE> informs us, consisteth of <IT>The Kings Majesty, sitting there as in his Royal Politick Capacity, and of the Three Estates of the Realm</IT>, viz. <IT>The Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal and the Commons</IT>. So that in Pro&rehy;priety of Speech, neither the <IT>Lords</IT> nor <IT>Commons</IT> (though in a vulgar Sense, and to some <FW
TYPE="catch">purpose</FW> <PB N="14">purposes, they are sometimes so called) I say neither <IT>Lords</IT> nor <IT>Commons</IT> strictly and properly are a Parliament without the <IT>King</IT>; who <IT>summoning</IT> them by his <IT>Writs</IT>; and <IT>presiding</IT> over them as their <IT>Head</IT>, ani&rehy;mates and informs them, and makes them a <IT>Legal Parliament</IT>, who otherwise, with&rehy;out the <IT>Royal Summons</IT>, would be no bet&rehy;ter than an unlawful and <IT>riotous</IT> Conven&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>The <IT>Lords</IT> and <IT>Commons</IT> have indeed an Authority, to meet and sit and debate as a <IT>Parliament</IT>; But they have this Authority <IT>solely</IT> from the <IT>King</IT>, and not from <IT>Them&rehy;selves</IT> or from the <IT>People</IT>: For, the King <IT>Calls</IT> them when he pleaseth, and so makes them a Parliament; and he <IT>Dissolves</IT> them when he thinks fit, and so makes them none.</P>
<P>Again, The Lords and Commons have an <IT>Authority</IT>, but not to <IT>Enact</IT> or make Laws (for the Words, <IT>Be it enacted</IT> refer only to the <IT>King</IT>) but to <IT>advise</IT> and <IT>consent</IT> to such Laws as shall be made by the King: And therefore this Phrase, <IT>Be it e&rehy;nacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons <PB
N="15">in this present Parliament assembled</IT>, &amp;c. hath an <IT>Ellipsis</IT> in it; and is to be read thus. Be it <IT>enacted</IT> by the Kings most Excellent Ma&rehy;jesty, by the <IT>Advice</IT> and with the <IT>Consent</IT> of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this Parliament assembled, <IT>&amp;c. Advice</IT> and <IT>Consent</IT> though for Brevities sake they are not always express'd, yet are still to be understood.</P>
<P>And for the Truth of this, I appeal to the <IT>Form</IT> of our <IT>antient</IT> Statutes (as also to some modern ones) and that not only in the <IT>Title</IT>, but also in the <IT>Preface</IT> and <IT>San&rehy;ction</IT> of them. For till the time of <IT>Henry</IT> VIII. the words <IT>Advice, Assent</IT> or <IT>Consent</IT> were never omitted. As appears from the Statutes themselves, to which recourse to be had.</P>
<P>From these Premises it plainly appears, <IT>That the Supreme Power is solely in the King</IT>; and, That the <IT>Two</IT> Houses of Parliament are (not Partners in the Government but) his most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects; as in all their <IT>Petitions</IT> most truly they do stile themselves. And that this Form in our Statutes, <IT>By the Authority of the same</IT>, when rightly understood, doth neither <PB
N="16" ID="pa5.p16">give them Title to make <IT>Laws</IT>, nor per&rehy;form any other Act of Soveraignty, which may countenance this Fancy of a <IT>Coordi&rehy;nate Power</IT>.</P>
<P>The next Pretence of these <IT>Republican Politicians</IT> (which I find they often urge in vindication of the late <IT>Rebellion</IT>) is this; <IT>That the King is One of the Three Estates</IT>; and from hence they infer: He hath but <IT>One</IT> share in the Government; and that the other <IT>Two</IT> are Co-partners with Him.</P>
<P>The which <IT>Suggestion</IT> being apparently <IT>False</IT>, I shall need to say the less in it's <IT>Confutation</IT>, especially being so happily prevented by a late Learned Head, <IT>viz. The Grand Question concerning the Bishops Right</IT>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The judicious Author of which Trea&rehy;tise having first premised;</P>
<P>That the <IT>whole Parliament</IT> assembled, are the best Judges, which are the <IT>Three E&rehy;states in Parliament</IT>; and that their Autho&rehy;rity is more to be valued, than that of a&rehy;ny particular Persons, whether <IT>Lawyers</IT> or others; He then, in many Instances, in&rehy;forms us from the Parliament <IT>Rolls</IT> and <PB

<P>It thus evidently appearing; That the <IT>King</IT>  is not <IT>One</IT>  of the <IT>Three Estates</IT>, and consequently, that his Authority is not li&rehy;mited or restrain'd, by the Coordinate Power of the other <IT>Two</IT>; we may with better assurance proceed to examin the Truth of their next Suggestion, <IT>viz. That <PB
N="19" ID="pa5.p19">the King of</IT> England <IT>is not an Absolute Mo&rehy;narch</IT>.</P>
<P>In which Inquiry, least I should dimi&rehy;nish the <IT>Kings</IT> just <IT>Right</IT> and <IT>Prerogative</IT> on the one hand, or encroach upon the Sub&rehy;jects <IT>Freedom</IT> and <IT>Liberty</IT> on the other, I must neither <IT>affirm</IT> nor <IT>deny</IT> without due Distinction.</P>
<P>Now the Kings Power and Authori&rehy;ty doth admit of a <IT>Twofold</IT> Considera&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>For, either we may observe it's <IT>efficient Cause</IT>; the Spring and Fountain from whence it flows; or else may take notice of the <IT>Execution</IT> and <IT>Administration</IT> of it.</P>
<P>As to the <IT>First</IT> of these;</P>
<P>If the Question should be asked; whence hath the <IT>King</IT> this Power to Rule and Govern these Nations? Who gave him this Authority?</P>
<P>To this a just Answer may be sugge&rehy;sted from His Majesties Royal <IT>Motto</IT>; <FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">DIEU ET MON DROIT</FOREIGN>, <IT>God and my Birth-right have given me these</IT> King&rehy;doms.</P>
<PB N="20" ID="pa5.p20"><P>If it further be demanded, How <IT>Birth&rehy;right</IT> doth Entitle to a Crown?

</P><P>And from hence we are occasionally instructed, how to understand that Con&rehy;troverted <IT>Place</IT> in <IT>Bracton</IT> (which I there&rehy;fore mention because I find it repeated with great Triumph in several <IT>Pamphlets</IT>) <FOREIGN

</P><P>It may suffice at present to observe, that the Crown of <IT>England</IT> is an <IT>Imperial Crown, i.e.</IT> Such a Crown which as to the <IT>Coercive</IT> part, is not subject to any human Tribu&rehy;nal or Judicature whatsoever, as most plainly appears from our <IT>Law-Books</IT> and <IT>Statutes</IT>.</P>

</P><P>This is the <IT>Section</IT>, in which that con&rehy;troverted Passage, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex habet Superiorem</FOREIGN>, &amp;c. is contain'd.</P>
<PB N="27"><P>Now as preparatory to a just Explica&rehy;tion, it will be pertinent to consider these <IT>Two</IT> Things.
</P><P><IT>First</IT>, That all difficult and obscure pla&rehy;ces in any Author, ought to be determi&rehy;ned by such as are plain and obvious; but not <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">e converso</FOREIGN>; and therefore,</P>
<P><IT>Secondly</IT>, When we doubt of the true Sence of an Author, it is much more <IT>mo&rehy;dest</IT> as well as <IT>charitable</IT>, to confess our own Ignorance, and to say, we do not know what he means, rather than to calumni&rehy;ate and mistake him, by affixing such a Sence to his Words as he never intended.</P>
<P>And consequently, it might be a suffi&rehy;cient <IT>Answer</IT> to affirm; That since our <IT>Bracton</IT> hath so plainly and so often told us; <IT>That the King is under none but God, That all Orders and Degrees of Men are Subject to the King, That he hath no equal much less Su&rehy;perior, That no man should presume to question his Actions</IT>, &amp;c. It evidently follows,</P>
<P>That whatever can be understood by this <IT>Curia</IT> (whether <IT>Lords</IT> or <IT>Commons</IT>) yet this <IT>Curia</IT> is not Superior to the <IT>King</IT>: It neither gave him his Authority at <IT>first</IT>, nor hath the least shadow of a Cooercive <PB
N="28">Power, to limit and restrain him. For certainly <IT>that</IT> cannot be the meaning of <IT>Bracton</IT>, which he hath so expresly con&rehy;tradicted in other parts of his <IT>Works</IT>.</P>
<P>But that I may <IT>Answer</IT> as well as <IT>Evade</IT>, I now come to explain, what I think to be the true Sence and Meaning of these Words, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex habet Superiorem</FOREIGN>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Subject matter of this <IT>Second Book</IT> of BRACTON is, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">De acquirendo rerum Do&rehy;minio</FOREIGN>. It explains the nature of <IT>Legal Ti&rehy;tles</IT>; and sets forth the several ways, by which a man may acquire such a Right and Property in the thing possess'd as to call it his <IT>own</IT>. And amongst many o&rehy;thers, DONATION as being the chief, is more particularly consider'd by him.</P>
<P>Now these <IT>Gifts</IT> or <IT>Grants</IT> (as he tells us in the beginning of this 16 <IT>Chap. Sect.</IT> 1.) <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">fiunt in scriptis, sicut in Chartis, ad perpetuam memoriam, propter brevem hominum vitam, & ut facilius probari possit Donatio</FOREIGN>. They are for Mortalities sake, put into Writing, that so the <IT>Donee</IT> (should his Title be que&rehy;stion'd) by the Evidence of such enrolled Deeds, may secure his Possession.</P>
<P>Of these Grants or Charters, some are <PB N="29">made by the <IT>King</IT>; others by <IT>private</IT> Men. And having largely discours'd of these private Charters, <IT>Sect.</IT> 2.4. and so on; in this intermediate 3<IT>d. Sect.</IT> he more parti&rehy;cularly gives us his Judgment <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de Chartis Regiis</FOREIGN>; which by way of Eminency are stiled <IT>Charters</IT>.</P>
<P><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">De Chartis vero Regiis & factis Regum, non debent nec possunt Justiciarii, nec privat&aelig; Per&rehy;son&aelig; disputare</FOREIGN>: Neither the <NOTE

<P>But if any part of it be ambiguous, and doth admit of a double Sense, than the Kings pleasure (since His Majesty who first made the Grant best knows his own Mind) is the surest and most authentick Interpretation; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Et etiam si omnino sit falsa <PB N="30">propter rasuram, vel quia forte signum apposi&rehy;tum est adulterinum, melius & tutius est quod coram ipso Rege procedatur ad Judicium</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>Moreover should there be suspicion, that any Charter (either by erasing or corrupt Interpolation) hath been falsely transcri&rehy;bed, 'tis the best and safest course, to de&rehy;termine the matter before the King him&rehy;self. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Item nec factum Regis, nec chartam po&rehy;test quis judicare, ita quod factum Domini Re&rehy;gis irritetur</FOREIGN>. However (as was said before) let no man presume to censure the Kings Charters, or any other of his Proceedings, so as to make null and void the Act and Deed of our Lord the King.</P>
<P><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sed dicere poterit quis</FOREIGN>, But here it may be Objected, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">quod Rex justitiam fecerit & bene</FOREIGN>, If the King will do Justice, 'tis well; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">& si hoc eadem ratione quod male, & ita imponere ei quod injuriam emendet, ne incidat Rex & Justic. in judicium viventis Dei propter injuriam</FOREIGN>, and should he not do Justice, it seems that must be well taken too, since no body dares tell him that he doth amiss, and ac&rehy;cordingly there will be none to admonish him to correct his fault, that so he may es&rehy;cape the Judgment of the living God.</P>
<PB N="31"><P>To this Objection BRACTON re&rehy;turns an <IT>Answer</IT>, though indeed not ushe&rehy;red in with the usual Formality of a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sic Respondeo</FOREIGN>. And his Answer is this;
</P><P><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex autem habet Superiorem</FOREIGN>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, none can controle the Kings Person or censure his Actions (his Majesty being <IT>Supream</IT> over all Persons, and in all Causes) <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">autem</FOREIGN>; but yet we have these encouraging Reasons, that the King will do Justice, and govern his People according to <IT>Right</IT>.</P>
<P>For 1. <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex habet Superiorem, Deum, sc.</FOREIGN> As high and as great as the King is, there is one higher and greater than he, even Al&rehy;mighty God; <IT>The King of Kings and Lord of Lords</IT>. It is therefore much hoped; that a due Sense of this dreadful Majesty (be&rehy;fore whose Tribunal the greatest <IT>Monarchs</IT> as well at the meanest of their <IT>Subjects</IT> must one day appear) may over-awe and restrain the King from all unjust and inju&rehy;rious Proceedings.</P>
<P>2. <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Item Legem per quam factus est Rex</FOREIGN>. And moreover the better to enable the King to do Justice, there is a <IT>Law</IT> to di&rehy;rect him in his Interpretations, the which <PB
N="32"><IT>Law</IT> his Majesty is obliged even in grati&rehy;tude to observe, since it was the Law which made him King. (But how this must be understood is already explain'd.)</P>
<P>3. <FOREIGN LANG="LAT" REND="it">Item, Curiam suam, <RO>viz.</RO> Comites, Baro&rehy;nes</FOREIGN>; but besides these <IT>Two</IT> preceding Con&rehy;siderations, there is a <IT>Third</IT> Expedient to restrain the King from all unjust and exor&rehy;bitant Proceedings.</P>
<P>For, as there is a God in Heaven to o&rehy;verawe him; and as there is a Law on Earth to direct him: So likewise he hath his <IT>Curia</IT>, to admonish and advise him, viz. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">Comites, Barones, quia Comites dicuntur quasi Socii Regis</FOREIGN>; His Nobility, his Earls and his Barons; who by reason of their con&rehy;stant attendance at Court, are admitted into a nearer Familiarity with his Majesty, and are, as it were, the Kings Companions. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">Et qui habet Socium, habet Magistrum</FOREIGN>; and by such Intimacy as this, they are, in some sort, the Supervisors and Censors of his A&rehy;ctions; <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">Et ideo si Rex fuerit sine fr&aelig;no, <RO>i.e.</RO> sine Lege, debent ei fr&aelig;num ponere</FOREIGN>. If there&rehy;fore the King shall omit to observe the Laws; 'tis then their Duty to admonish him of his neglect; saying, SIR, This is <PB
N="33">the Law, this should bridle you; this should limit and direct your Actions. And this doubtless they will do, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">nisi ipsimet fue&rehy;rint cum Rege sine fr&aelig;no</FOREIGN>; unless they them&rehy;selves have a mind to be lawless as well as the King.</P>
<P>But if matters should be brought to this pass, what shall then the poor Sub&rehy;jects do? how shall their Grievances be redress'd? Shall it not then be lawful to take up Arms (in the just Defence of King and Kingdom) to remove these evil Coun&rehy;cellors from the King? No such matter! <FOREIGN

<P>BRACTON in this 2<IT>d. Book Chap.</IT> 16. &sect;. 3. is discoursing (as I have already ob&rehy;served) <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de Chartis Regiis</FOREIGN>. And he tells us; that the <IT>Royal Charters</IT>, when either doubt&rehy;ful or obscure, are to be determined <FOREIGN
REND="go" LANG="LAT">co&rehy;ram Rege</FOREIGN> <IT>i.e.</IT> in the Courts of <IT>Kings-Bench</IT> and <IT>Chancery</IT>. (For these being the <IT>Kings own immediate personal Courts</IT>, in one of which the <IT>Kings</IT> of <IT>England</IT> have formerly sate in Person, all <IT>Writs</IT> returnable there run in this Style, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">coram nobis</FOREIGN>; and all judicial <IT>Re&rehy;cords</IT> there are stiled, and <IT>the Pleas</IT> there holden entered <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Coram Rege</FOREIGN>. And there&rehy;fore this Phrase in BRACTON <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Coram Re&rehy;ge</FOREIGN> is, I think warrantably render'd, the Courts of <IT>Kings Bench</IT> and <IT>Chancery</IT>.</P>
<P>Now if the <IT>Plaintiff</IT> shall suspect, that the Proceedings in these <IT>Courts</IT> are not just <PB
N="35">and equal, he may then make his <IT>Appeal</IT>. For the <IT>King</IT> hath not only <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Legem</FOREIGN>; his ordi&rehy;nary Courts of Justice, but also <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Curiam suam</FOREIGN>, (viz.) <FOREIGN

<P>But if the <IT>Party</IT> shall still complain that he hath not Justice; there is then no other Remedy but <IT>Prayers</IT> and <IT>Patience</IT>.</P>
<P>For, this <IT>House of Lords</IT> being the Su&rehy;preme and highest Court of <IT>Judicature</IT>, no Earthly Appeal can be made any further. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sistendum est in aliquo</FOREIGN>. In all Judicial Pro&rehy;ceedings, <IT>Ecclesiastical</IT> and <IT>Civil</IT>, there must be <IT>a <FOREIGN

For, as the <IT>Law</IT> of <IT>Nature</IT> doth instruct us, that <IT>Appeals</IT> must of necessity be allowed (otherwise those Injuries which may be occasion'd, through the Ignorance or Corruption of inferior <IT>Judges</IT> could never be redress'd) so the same Law doth also teach us; That <IT>Appeals</IT> must not be <IT>Infinite; i.e.</IT> There must be some <IT>Supreme Power</IT>, in whose final Determina&rehy;tion (be it <IT>right</IT>, or be it <IT>wrong</IT>) all <IT>Inferiors</IT> must acquiesce and submit. Otherwise, no <IT>Controversies</IT> could be decided; nay, <PB

<P>These are my present Thoughts of this difficult Passage: And whether I have yet given it's proper Sence is humbly submit&rehy;ted to the Impartial Reader. But whether I <IT>have</IT> or have <IT>not</IT>; the <IT>Republican Objector</IT> is again desired to take notice;</P>
<P>That whatever else can be the meaning of these Words, yet our <IT>Bracton</IT> doth not affirm this <IT>Curia</IT> to be superior to the King; Such an Interpretation being inconsistent with <IT>Grammar</IT> as well as <IT>Loyalty</IT>.</P>
<P>We have this Rule in our <IT>Syntaxis</IT>; that, <IT>If the Relative be referr'd to two Clauses or more, then the Relative shall be put in the Plural Num&rehy;ber</IT>.</P>
<P>If therefore this Relative word <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Superior</FOREIGN> do refer not only to <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Deum</FOREIGN>, but also to <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Le&rehy;gem</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Curiam</FOREIGN>, it should not be <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Superiorem</FOREIGN> in the <IT>Singular</IT>, but <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Superiores</FOREIGN> in the <IT>Plural</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Bracton</IT> was not only very learned and judicious as to his <IT>Sence</IT>, but also (consider&rehy;ing the Age he lived in, and the Subject he discours'd on) very polite and elegant as to his <IT>Style</IT>; and consequently we must <PB
N="37">not suppose him guilty of so gross a <IT>Sol&aelig;&rehy;cism</IT>, which the meanest <IT>School-Boy</IT> is able to correct.</P>
<P>If the Patrons of the Faction, who are very hard to please, shall think fit to Re&rehy;ply; That it is a most unusual and Pedan&rehy;tick Method, to interpret a <IT>Law-Maxim</IT> by a Rule in <IT>Grammar</IT>; and thence are unalte&rehy;rably resolv'd to insist upon it; That un&rehy;less we can explain, in what Sence this <IT>Cu&rehy;ria</IT> is Superior to the King, all that hither&rehy;to hath been said on this occasion is trifling and explosive;</P>
<P>If, I say, these <IT>Republicans</IT> will not other&rehy;wise be <IT>contented</IT>, let them then take it thus. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex habet superiorem ----- Curiam</FOREIGN> ----- i.e. The King can do more with the Advice and Assistance of his <IT>Curia</IT> then without it.

<P>If this will not satisfie. <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cras respondebo</FOREIGN>. For at present, I think fit to add no more in this matter.</P>
<P>This passage of BRACTON (which hath given us so large a Digression) being thus dispatch'd; we shall now return to our former Discourse.</P>
<PB N="38" ID="pa5.p38"><P>'Tis undeniably evident from the Au&rehy;thentick Records of the Kingdom (not to mention private Authorities) <IT>That the King of</IT> England <IT>hath no Superior but God. That His Majesty did not receive his Authority from any Earthly Power. That he is not F&oelig;udatory, either to the Pope or any other Foreign Prince, much less to his own People. That he was not admitted to his Kingdoms with any Limitations or Conditions</IT>; As the Kings of <IT>Poland</IT> and some others are. And consequently, since the Terms <IT>Absolute</IT> and <IT>Conditional</IT> are op&rehy;posite and contradistinct; If the Kings Power and Authority (with respect to its Original <IT>Efficient</IT> Cause) be neither <IT>Condi&rehy;tional</IT> nor <IT>Dependent</IT>, it is then <IT>Absolute</IT> as well as <IT>Independent</IT>. And therefore we may safely conclude (in this sence as now explained) <IT>The King of</IT> England <IT>is an ab&rehy;solute Monarch</IT>.
</P><P>But here I expect it will be reply'd (and 'tis a very Popular Objection.)</P>
<P>That the <IT>Coronation Oath</IT>, in which there is a plain <IT>Contract</IT> and <IT>Bargain</IT> between the <IT>King</IT> and his <IT>People</IT>, doth sufficiently inti&rehy;mate; That the <IT>Crown</IT> is Conditional, <IT>i.e.</IT> was conferr'd upon his Majesty with cer<PB
N="39">tain Limitations and Conditions. For, the King having promised, <GO>to keep and defend the Laws and rightful Customs of the Kingdom</GO>, &amp;c. He is then publickly shew'd to the People; and their <IT>consent</IT> to his Coronation being first demanded; he is, by that solemn Action, accepted as their King. Plainly insinuating, that without such a Promise on <IT>his</IT> part, he would not have been accepted on <IT>theirs</IT>. And from hence Mr. SIDNEY (a very Authentick Author with some men) doth infer; That there is a mutual Compact between the <IT>King</IT> and his <IT>Subjects</IT>; and if the <IT>King</IT> doth not perform his Duty, the <IT>Subjects</IT> are discharg'd from <IT>theirs</IT>. His words are these, <IT>That those Laws were to be observ'd, and the</IT> Oaths <IT>taken by them, having the Force of a</IT> Contract <IT>between Magistrate and People, could not be</IT> violated <IT>without dan&rehy;ger of</IT> dissolving <IT>the whole Fabrick</IT>: Which in plain <IT>English</IT> is this: If the <IT>King</IT> breaks his Oath, and doth not govern according to <IT>Law</IT>; he then forfeits his Crown, and the People are absolved from their Obe&rehy;dience.</P>
<P>In Answer to which, we are to take no<PB N="40">tice; that this plausible <IT>Objection</IT> is raised upon a false Foundation, <IT>viz. That the Co&rehy;ronation Oath makes the King</IT>; which is a most gross as well as dangerous Mistake; the King being as perfect and compleatly <IT>King before</IT> his Coronation as <IT>after</IT>.</P>
<P>'Tis a <IT>Maxim</IT> of our Law, <IT>The King ne&rehy;ver dyes</IT>: There being no such thing here in <IT>England</IT> as an <IT>Interregnum</IT>. For the very same moment that the <IT>Predecessor</IT> deceaseth, the Rights of <IT>Majesty</IT> descend and fall up&rehy;on the <IT>Successor</IT>. And herein I am instructed by those eminent <IT>Lawyers</IT>, the Lord Chan&rehy;cellor <IT>Egerton</IT>, and Sir <IT>Edw. Coke</IT>. By the former thus,</P>
<P REND="it">The Soveraignty is in the Person of the King, the Crown is but an Ensign of Soveraignty. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>L. Chanc.</IT> Egerton <IT>Postnat.</IT> p. 73.</NOTE> The Investure and Coronation are but Ceremonies of Honour and Majesty. The King is an absolute and perfect King before he be Crowned, and with&rehy;out those Ceremonies.</P>

<P>But that I may effectually convince our <IT>Associators</IT> of their mistake in this matter, I thus argue <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ad hominem</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>Was his present Majesty <IT>actually</IT> King (<IT>i.e.</IT> King <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de facto</FOREIGN> as well as <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de jure</FOREIGN>) before his Coronation, or was he not?</P>
<P>If they acknowledg that he <IT>was</IT>; the Cause is then decided. But if they say he was <IT>not</IT>; I must then remind them of ano&rehy;ther point of <IT>Law</IT>, laid down by that <IT>O&rehy;racle of the Law</IT> in the preceding words, <IT>a Pardon granted by a King</IT> <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">de jure</FOREIGN>, <IT>that is not also</IT> <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de facto</FOREIGN> <IT>is void</IT>. Now when they have first consider'd; That the <IT>Act of Oblivion</IT> was made before the King was <IT>Crown'd</IT>, I shall then leave it to themselves to deter&rehy;mine the Case.</P>
<P>Doubtless upon <IT>second</IT> Thoughts which are usually the best, they will readily con&rehy;fess; That his present <IT>Majesty</IT> was <IT>actually</IT> King before his <IT>Coronation</IT>; and consequent&rehy;ly, That the Oath which he then took, was not any <IT>Condition</IT> preparatory to his admit&rehy;tance to the <IT>Kingly</IT> Power.</P>
<PB N="42"><P><IT>Coronation</IT> then <IT>is but a Ceremony, and no part of his Title</IT>: I say, it is but a <IT>Ceremony</IT>; and yet (that I may remove some imperti&rehy;nent Scruples against it) it is no trifling, in&rehy;significant Ceremony: For,
</P><P><IT>First</IT>, The solemn Splendor in which the <IT>King</IT> appears in that Action (the generali&rehy;ty of People being much affected with outward <IT>Pomp</IT>) doth naturally make Im&rehy;pressions of awe and reverence towards his <IT>Person</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Secondly</IT>, The <IT>Oath</IT> which he then takes, may expel all jealous Fears; disposing his <IT>Subjects</IT> chearfully to submit to his future <IT>Government</IT>. For when the King (who is not responsible to <IT>them</IT> for any of <IT>his</IT> Acti&rehy;ons) shall condescend thus <IT>publickly</IT> to pro&rehy;mise his People, in the Presence of that God who gave him his Trust (and to whom alone he must render an Account for the management of it) That he will govern his Subjects according to <IT>Law</IT>; That he will preserve <IT>Religion</IT> from Here&rehy;sy and Schism; defend their <IT>Persons</IT> from wrong and violence; secure their <IT>Estates</IT> from Fraud and Rapine: Such assurance as this, must needs enlarge their Affecti<PB
N="43" ID="pa5.p43">ons to their Prince; make their submission more hearty; their Obedience more chear&rehy;ful, since under his Government (if it is not their own Fault) they may rationally expect to <IT>live a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty</IT>.</P>
<P>It appears, I hope, from these Premises (notwithstanding this or any other Ob&rehy;jection to the contrary) That the Kings Power, in respect to it's Original, is <IT>Abso&rehy;lute</IT>, i.e. He received it from none but God. Neither from the <IT>Pope</IT>, nor any other <IT>For&rehy;aign Prince</IT>, much less from his own Peo&rehy;ple.</P>
<P>But now when we speak of the Kings Authority, with respect to the <IT>Execution</IT> and <IT>Administration</IT> of it, the Case is very different. For the Kings of <IT>England</IT>, out of their abundant Grace and Favour, and to make their <IT>Government</IT> more easie and acceptable to their Subjects, have suffer'd themselves to be so limited in the <IT>Exercise</IT> of their Power; That they can neither make <IT>Laws</IT>, nor raise <IT>Taxes</IT> but in <IT>Parlia&rehy;ment</IT>; much less can they pretend to take away the <IT>Life</IT>, or dispose of the <IT>Estate</IT> of the meanest of their Subjects but by due <PB
N="44">course of <IT>Law</IT>: And therefore in this <IT>se&rehy;cond</IT> Consideration of his Authority, <IT>viz.</IT> the <IT>Execution</IT> and <IT>Administration</IT> of it; <IT>The King of</IT> England <IT>is not an Absolute but a limi&rehy;ted Monarch</IT>.</P>
<P>And indeed, if these <IT>Republicans</IT> were not much more forward, to remind the <IT>King</IT> of his Duty than to discharge their <IT>own</IT>, these things did not need to be repea&rehy;ted. For the <IT>King</IT> hath very often most gratiously promised; That he will govern by, and according to, the Laws of the Land and not otherwise. And that he will use the Power, Trust and Office commit&rehy;ted to him, for the good and benefit of the <IT>People</IT>, and for the preservation of their Rights and Liberties. All this is rea&rehy;dily granted, in the very words of the <IT>Objectors</IT>.</P>
<P>Only this Phrase, <IT>That he will govern according to the Laws</IT>, <GO>and not otherwise</GO> for the avoiding of mistakes, must be a little explained.</P>
<P>There are some Men, either through Ignorance or Malice, who have fancied; because the King is obliged to govern <IT>by Law</IT>, that therefore he must always <IT>act</IT> <PB
N="45" ID="pa5.p45">according to the <IT>Letter</IT> of it: So as that it shall not be in his Power, <IT>for instance</IT> (especially when it is their <IT>Interest</IT> to re&rehy;strain him) either to <IT>Pardon</IT> Capital Offen&rehy;ders; to <IT>Change</IT> the manner of their Death; or to <IT>mitigate</IT> the rigour of the Law on a&rehy;ny other occasion. And, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in fine</FOREIGN>, these con&rehy;fident <IT>Reformers</IT> (who trade in <IT>Post-scripts</IT> more than <IT>Bracton</IT>) do talk of the <IT>Kings Prerogative</IT> at such a rate; as if it were an <IT>Arbitrary, Illegal Encroachment</IT>; and are so extravagant as to fancy; That by dimi&rehy;nishing the <IT>Kings Prerogative</IT>, they advance the <IT>Laws</IT>; and that to oppose the <IT>King</IT>, is to defend the <IT>Kingdom</IT>.</P>
<P>In charity therefore to these men, and to rectify their mistakes, I shall briefly lay down the nature of the Kings <IT>Preroga&rehy;tive</IT>: What it is? how it comes to be E&rehy;stablish'd? And whether, as is pretended, it be destructive to <IT>the Liberty of the Sub&rehy;ject</IT>.</P>

<P>From whence our <IT>new Politicians</IT> may please to observe. <IT>That the Kings Preroga&rehy;tive is established by Law</IT>; and his Majesty hath as good Law for his Royal Preroga&rehy;tives. viz. <IT>The descent of the Crown to the next in Blood: The Power of Calling and Dissolv&rehy;ing Parliaments: The Negative Voice: The Power of the Militia: Pardoning Offenders</IT>, &amp;c.

<P>Whoever therefore shall presume to di&rehy;spute these <IT>Priviledges</IT> of the <IT>Crown</IT>, he must not think me uncharitable whilst I tell him, He is an <IT>Enemy</IT> to the fundamen&rehy;tal Laws of <IT>England</IT>, and a <IT>Betrayer</IT> of the Rights of the Kingdom.</P>
<PB N="47"><P>If the Case be thus, may some say; If these <IT>Royal Prerogatives</IT> are so sacred as not to be touch'd; it would then be a very suitable undertaking to enlarge your, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> and to acquaint us more distinctly what they are, and where we may find them.

<P>The right method therefore to be in&rehy;form'd in this matter, is to search the writ&rehy;ten Laws, with the learned Interpretati&rehy;ons upon them. For though these Sta&rehy;tutes are not <IT>Constitutive</IT> of the Royal Pre&rehy;rogatives (<IT>All</IT> <NOTE

<P>I say, though these Priviledges of the Crown are most of them <IT>antecedent</IT> to our <IT>Acts</IT> of Parliament, and the <IT>written</IT> deter&rehy;mined Cases of our Laws (and consequent<PB

<P>But since every one hath not the <IT>Leisure</IT> or the <IT>Ability</IT> for so laborious a Task; those therefore shall desire <FOREIGN

<P>That the King hath Power, in many ca&rehy;ses, to Dispense with the Laws: And that <IT>no</IT> <NOTE

LANG="LAT">non obstante</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>The Reason of which <IT>Prerogative</IT> (which to some unthinking Men may seem extra&rehy;vagant) is plainly this.</P>
<P>All human Constitutions are liable to Defects: And there was never any <IT>Law</IT> yet framed with such <IT>Policy</IT> and Skill, which might not, on some occasion or other, be burthensome to the <IT>Subject</IT>. For particular <PB
N="49">Cases and Contingencies are so infinitely various, that it is impossible for <IT>human</IT> Wis&rehy;dom to foresee or prevent them.</P>
<P>And therefore it is absolutely necessary; That there should in all Governments be some <IT>Power</IT>, Superior and <IT>Paramount</IT> to the written Laws: By whose Authority the Subject might be reliev'd and pardon'd; when the nice and strict Observance of the Law (through some unexpected Event) might be grievous to <IT>himself</IT>, or destructive to the <IT>Publick</IT>. And <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin">Bish. <IT>Sander&rehy;sons</IT> Judg. of subm. to Usurp. p. 18.</NOTE> <IT>this Power of dis&rehy;pensing with particular Laws</IT> (as the learned Bishop <IT>Sanderson</IT> informs us) <IT>is such a Pre&rehy;rogative, as without which no Commonwealth can be well govern'd; but Justice would be turn'd in&rehy;to Gall and Wormwood: Nor can the Supream Governor, without Forfeiture of that Faithful&rehy;ness which he oweth to the Publick-Weal divest himself thereof</IT>. </P>
<P>If some Men (who are very unwilling to give the <IT>King</IT> his Due) are still dissatisfi&rehy;ed in the point; the present posture of Af&rehy;fairs here in <IT>England</IT> may then fully con&rehy;vince them.</P>
<P>We all know that according to the Law <IT>High-Treason</IT> is punishable with <PB
N="50">Death. And the Judgment of the Court, on such occasions, is to be <IT>Hang'd, Drawn and Quarter'd</IT>. This is Law. Let me therefore ask these Men. Can the <IT>King</IT> by his <IT>Prero&rehy;gative</IT> dispense with this Law, so as to free the <IT>Criminal</IT> from the Punishment (<FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">a Toto</FOREIGN> or <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">a Tanto</FOREIGN>) or can he not? If they say <IT>not. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Ip&rehy;si viderint</FOREIGN></IT>. Let them look to that who are most deeply concern'd.</P>
<P>But if now at the last they are grown so considerate, as to say that he <IT>can</IT>: Give me leave then to expostulate with them, con&rehy;cerning that late Instance of the unfortu&rehy;nate <IT>Lord Stafford</IT>.</P>
<P>When his <IT>Majesty</IT>, out of Compassion to that <IT>Noblemans</IT> Person and respect to his <IT>Quality</IT>, had changed the manner of his Death, and given him the favour to be Beheaded: What a noise was then raised, <IT>That the Law must be observ'd</IT>? What Fears and Apprehensions of <IT>Abritary Power</IT>! What a Tumult did those <IT>scrupulous She&rehy;riffs</IT> make on that occasion, by Petitioning the <IT>Two Houses</IT>; Whether the Kings <IT>Writ</IT> ought to be obey'd? But what Answer they receiv'd both from <IT>Lords</IT> and <IT>Commons</IT> is sufficiently known.</P>
<PB N="51"><P>I shall make no <IT>Reflections</IT> upon it, tho indeed the Impertinence of that Action (in which I doubt they were encourag'd by some greater than themselves) might deserve a <IT>Remark</IT>.
</P><P>From these Premises it is evident, That there is <FOREIGN

REND="it" LANG="LAT">Salus populi suprema Lex esto</FOREIGN>; when rightly understood is a full proof of this Assertion.</P>
<P>As therefore on the one hand;</P>
<P>When <IT>Sedition</IT> is rampant, and <IT>affronts</IT> the Government; when the <IT>Mercy</IT> of a King shall be voted his <IT>weakness</IT>; and his Royal compassion and unwillingness to <IT>Punish</IT>, shall have this Gloss put upon it; <IT>He dares not do it</IT>.</P>
<P>As in such Case, Reason of State (which is <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Salus Populi</FOREIGN>) doth require; That some should be executed <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in terrorem</FOREIGN>; to re<PB N="52">press the insolence of others; So on the other hand,</P>
<P>When Tumults are abated; when Fa&rehy;ction is broken, and that Men begin to ac&rehy;knowledg their Mistakes, and return to their Wits: If under such inviting Circum&rehy;stances as these, the King out of his Grace and Mercy, shall either <IT>Pardon</IT> a Traitor, or abate the <IT>rigour</IT> of his Sentence, who will pretend to say, that such undeserved Favour is <IT>Illegal</IT>? Or that the King, whe&rehy;ther he <IT>pardon</IT> or <IT>punish</IT>, doth not <IT>govern</IT>, in both Instances, <IT>according to Law</IT>?</P>
<P>These Objectors go on.</P>
<P REND="it">If the King thus entrusted to keep the Laws and preserve Religion, should be guilty of a wicked Design, to subvert our Laws, and de&rehy;stroy our Religion, by introducing an Arbitrary, Tyrannical Government; he must then under&rehy;stand, that he is but an <GO>Officer of Trust</GO>.</P>
<P>All this is granted; If the word <GO>Trust</GO> do only refer to <IT>Almighty God</IT>, but not to the <IT>People</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>King</IT> doth chearfully acknowledg, that he is <IT>Authoriz'd</IT> and Deputed by the <IT>most High</IT>, to govern these Nations; and that he must render an Account for so <PB
N="53">great a Trust committed to his charge. And though the King hath many Enemies, both <IT>Spiritual</IT> and <IT>Temporal</IT>, yet his Support is this. He who gave him his <IT>Commission</IT> is able to Protect him. He hath hitherto very signally preserv'd him. And it is the constant, hearty <IT>Prayer</IT> of all Loyal Sub&rehy;jects; That his God, and the God of his <IT>Fathers</IT> will preserve him still. His Majesty hath indeed many <IT>Enemies</IT> (and good Prin&rehy;ces did never want them) but <IT>in the Mercy of the most High he shall not miscarry</IT>.</P>
<P>But if this <GO>Trust</GO> do refer to the <IT>People</IT>, as if the Kings Power and Authority were derived to him from the <IT>People</IT> by way of <IT>Pact</IT> or <IT>Contract</IT>: Let them then explain, <IT>Who</IT> are this People, with whom he did thus Contract? <IT>When</IT> was this Bargain made? <IT>What</IT> are the Conditions? <IT>Before</IT> what Witnesses? <IT>Who</IT> must <IT>Judge</IT> of the Delinquency? <IT>VVhere</IT> are the <IT>Records</IT> of these Transactions to be perused?</P>
<P>If no Evidence to confirm any of these Instances; the Case is then decided by that known Maxim, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Idem est non esse & non ap&rehy;parere</FOREIGN>. This <IT>Fundamental Contract of the Na&rehy;tion</IT>, is only a hard Word to amuse the <PB
N="54">vulgar. We know not <IT>what</IT> it is, nor <IT>where</IT> to find it.</P>
<P>But, it follows in the Objection.</P>
<P><IT>The Parliament of England (the Representa&rehy;tives of the People, in whom all Power doth O&rehy;riginally reside) they are to take Order for the A&rehy;nimadversion and Punishment of such an Offen&rehy;ding Governour. Parliaments were ordain'd to re&rehy;strain the exorbitant Power of Kings and to re&rehy;dress the Grievances of the People</IT>.</P>
<P>The Sum of which charge is this.</P>
<P>There is a Coercive Power over the King. Which <IT>Power</IT> (<IT>Mr.</IT> SIDNEY tells us) <IT>Originally in the People of England, is dele&rehy;gated unto the Parliament</IT>. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Sidney's</IT> Tryal. p. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>To which I do thus Answer.</P>
<P>That though his <IT>Majesty</IT> hath a just esteem for <IT>Parliaments</IT>; and thinks the Par&rehy;liament of <IT>England</IT> the happiest Constitu&rehy;tion that ever <IT>Nation</IT> did enjoy; and hath gratiously <CORR
SIC="assnr'd">assur'd</CORR> us; That no <IT>Irregularities</IT> of Parliaments, shall make him out of Love with <IT>Parliaments</IT>; but that he will have frequent <IT>Parliaments</IT>: Yet such an ex&rehy;travagant Power of Parliaments as is here pretended, is such height of <IT>Treason</IT>; as deserves a <IT>sharper</IT> Confutation than can be given it from this Treatise.</P>
<PB N="55">
<P>As to the point of <IT>Non-Resistance</IT> (most seasonable to be enforc'd at this time) I did once design very fully to have enlarg'd upon it. To have shew'd its Obligation from all Laws <IT>Natural, Positive, Divine, Human</IT>. As also to have Answer'd the most Popular <IT>Pleas</IT> for such <IT>Resistance</IT>. But I am so happily prevented by the Learned Labours of others (particularly my <IT>Lord Bishop of VVinchester</IT>, Dr <IT>Falkner</IT> and Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT>; who have indeed exhausted that Subject) that I shall give no further trou&rehy;ble; but conclude my short Discourse with this following Argument.
</P><P REND="it">The Supream Power must not be resisted;</P>
<P REND="it">But the King of England hath Supreme Power; Therefore His Majesty cannot lawfully be resisted.</P>
<P>The <IT>Proposition</IT> is the voice of Nature. There can be no <IT>Order</IT> nor Government, unless this Truth be admitted. Reason tells us; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Par in parem non habet potestatem</FOREIGN>, much less hath an Inferior a Coercive Power o&rehy;ver his Superior.</P>
<P>To which let me observe; That even the late <IT>Rebels</IT> themselves were convinc'd in this matter. For, to vindicate their former <IT>Treasons</IT>, and to patronize their inten<PB
N="56">ded <IT>Murder</IT> of that <IT>Blessed Prince</IT>, they vo&rehy;ted, <IT>Jan.</IT> 4. 1648. Resolv'd, <IT>That the People are (under God) the Original of all just Powers. That the Commons of England Assembled in Par&rehy;liament, being chosen by, and representing the People, have the Supreme Power in the Nation. That whatsoever is Enacted or declared for Law by the Commons in Parliament hath the Force of a Law, and the People concluded thereby, though consent of King and Peers be not had thereunto</IT>.</P>
<P>Plainly insinuating, That whilst the Subjects of <IT>England</IT>, according to their Duty, did acknowledg the <IT>Supreme Power</IT> to be in the <IT>King</IT>, they must needs appre&rehy;hend, That the <IT>War</IT> was <IT>Rebellion</IT>; and his pretended <IT>Judges</IT> were <IT>Traitors</IT>.</P>
<P>And as to the <IT>Assumption</IT>, viz.</P>
<P><IT>That the King of England hath Supreme Pow&rehy;er</IT>; this, I hope, hath been so fully prov'd in this little Treatise, that I might suppose the <IT>Conclusion</IT> without any further Enlarge&rehy;ment.</P>
<P>But because some late Seditious <IT>Pam&rehy;phlets</IT> have very impertinently advanc'd the <IT>Power</IT> of Parliaments; I shall, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ex abundan&rehy;ti</FOREIGN>, thus undeniably convince them, <IT>That the Parliament of</IT> England <IT>is Subject to the</IT> King.</P>
