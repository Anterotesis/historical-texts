<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<P>&Tic;<SC>Rue</SC> Honour and Greatness never ap&rehy;pear brighter or more illustrious, than when they condescend to <PB
N="ij">patronize and encourage all useful Arts and Sciences. And to whom can any of us more naturally run for Shel&rehy;ter and Protection, than to a Person of your <SC>Grace's</SC> comprehensive Knowledge and Ex&rehy;perience both of <IT>Men</IT> and <IT>Things</IT>?
</P><P>I own I am no Friend to the <IT>Abuse</IT> of AUTHORITY; but when its best <IT>Use</IT> and <IT>End</IT> are made to answer Man's Happiness and the Good of Society by En&rehy;couragements and Example, then <IT>Authority</IT> appears in its <PB
N="iij">greatest Glory; and such ex&rehy;alted Patterns as your <SC>Grace</SC> will draw Multitudes after you, to pursue Things that are innocent and useful.</P>
<P>The Subject of the following Papers in a peculiar Manner leads me to your <SC>Grace</SC>, the great Lover and Encourager of vegetable Nature. For tho' too many can con&rehy;tent themselves to live upon the <IT>Wast</IT>, and as <IT>Destroyers</IT>; yet how much a Nobler Principle is it to <IT>plant</IT> and <IT>cherish</IT>, than to <IT>cut down</IT> <PB

And how com&rehy;mendable is that unwearied Diligence in your <SC>Grace</SC> to leave every where <IT>growing Monuments</IT> of your Wisdom and Care, of your true Re&rehy;gard to the Welfare of late Posterity, as well as of the present Age?

<HEAD><RO>THE PREFACE</RO>.</HEAD>
<P>To make my Two former Treatises of Gardening compleat, and if possible more intelligible, I have been prevailed upon to add this following <RO><SC>Kalendar</SC></RO>. The rather; because (as far as I can observe) most of our modern Authors in this Way, have done little else but transcribe from <RO>Evelyn, Quinteney</RO>, and <RO>Woolridge</RO>; and therefore have been generally so unfortunate, as to insert their Errors and Mistakes, as well as their useful Rules.</P>
<PB N="ij"><P>This leads me to say upon this Oc&rehy;casion, for my own Sake, and for the Sake of the Publick, that the Book cal&rehy;led the <RO>Lady's Recreation</RO> could not be published by my Approbation, because it was never seen by me, till it was in Print: Besides, I have Reason to think it was an Artifice of the Booksellers to im&rehy;pose upon the World, under the borrowed Name of <RO>Evelyn</RO>.
</P><P>I hope it will not need an Apology, that, as a Divine, I now and then lay hold of an useful Moral, and am willing to direct the Ingenious Naturalist some&rehy;times to look upward. But yet I have taken care to avoid mere Embelishment, or at least such Things as are no Ways to my Purpose: For which Reason I could not satisfy my self to trifle, so as to tell the World, that <RO>January</RO> hath <RO>31</RO> Days, <RO>February 28</RO>, and the Moon <RO>29</RO>.</P>
<PB N="iij"><P>Persons that have not had long Ex&rehy;perience, may easily fall into Mistakes; and that is their Misfortune: But to lead others into Mistakes, under the Gra&rehy;vity of <RO>Instructors</RO>, is a great <RO>Fault</RO>; and you know not when to trust such, though they should happen to speak right.
</P><P>Indeed it seems to me no small Re&rehy;proach to the <RO>English</RO> Nation, that we suffer so many <RO>French</RO> Books of Gar&rehy;dening to be obtruded upon us, contain&rehy;ing Rules calculated for another Climate, and which tend to lead us into many Er&rehy;rors.</P>
<P>As to my self, I am far from think&rehy;ing, either that I have not been, or may not be mistaken: But I can truly say, I would not willingly or hastily lead the Ingenious Gardener into any Error. And I believe it hath sufficiently appeared to the World, that I have all along en<PB
N="iv">deavoured to make the Art of Gar&rehy;dening Familiar, Profitable, and Enter&rehy;taining.</P>
<P>I have sometimes indeed been so un&rehy;happy, as to lie under the Imputation of Blame, for troubling the World with Rules about Gardening, and the Go&rehy;vernment of the Vegetable Kingdom, having my self only a small Garden, bad Walls, and a worse Soil. But I flatter my self the more ingenious Part of Mankind will attribute these, not to my <RO>Fault</RO> but to my <RO>Misfortune</RO>. And if under such disadvantageous Circumstances, some&rehy;thing of Pleasure and Profit too may be had, this methinks should rather give encouragement to All, than be the Occa&rehy;sion of Offense to Any; this should keep even the most Unhappy from de&rehy;spairing of some Reward of their Labour and Diligence.</P>
<P>If I should still be so unhappy as to be blamed for recommending Vine<PB
N="v">yards, and giving Rules for the Ma&rehy;nagement of them, having none of my own, and being under an Impossi&rehy;bility of having any; to such I only say, That my Observations are by no means confined to my own Garden, Soil, and Situation. I experience the Worst; and I can see the Best Abroad. Nay, I bless God, I can see with Pleasure and with&rehy;out Envy, what others do or may en&rehy;joy, and what I my self want.</P>
<P>To trouble then the Reader here no further, I will only add; that if All or Any of those Directions, which I have laid before the World in the plainest and most familiar Manner, shall in any Degree tend to bring in that Interest of Pleasure and Profit to others, which I have so long in some De&rehy;gree experienced my self, it will greatly add to my private Satisfaction, and to the Pleasure I enjoy in my own Retire&rehy;ment.</P></DIV></FRONT>

<HEAD>The <SC>Introduction</SC>.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic;T is on all Hands granted, and with great Reason agreed on, that good Laws are necessary and essential to the Being of good Go&rehy;verment: But I think it may also with as great Reason be added, that with<PB
N="2">out <IT>OEconomy</IT> and <IT>Order</IT> in the Exe&rehy;cution of those Laws, the greatest Beauty of Government is lost. For if the Law is not executed, it is only a dead Letter, <IT>Useless</IT>, and <IT>Insigni&rehy;ficant</IT>: Or if it <IT>be</IT> executed, yet if it be done without regard to <IT>Time</IT> and <IT>Place</IT>, and <IT>Circumstances</IT>, it will fre&rehy;quently lose its Force and its End, introducing of Consequence, Anarchy, and Disorder.
</P><P>These Observations hold equally true in all Governments and Societies, whether Little or Great, Publick or Private: And I add here too in the <IT>Vegetable</IT>, as well as <IT>Animal</IT> Kingdom. For the Lord or Governor over any Part of Vegetable Nature, is not less in Danger of losing the Beauty and Benefit of his Government, from the Want of a seasonable Execution of good Laws, than a Sovereign Prince is, of being deprived of the Blessing of Prosperity, and the hearts of his Subjects, from Partiality or Injustice.</P>
<PB N="3"><P>It is, I confess, therefore with a View of restoring and establishing a true and exact <IT>Order</IT> and <IT>OEconomy</IT> in a Garden, that I have been prevailed upon to add this <SC>Kalendar</SC> to the Two other Treatises I have pub&rehy;lished on this Subject.
</P><P>I have indeed <IT>therein</IT> already con&rehy;sulted, and had a due Regard to the <IT>Order of Nature</IT>, resolving to make every Thing plain and intelligible, e&rehy;ven to young Beginners, by a <IT>natural</IT> Method of Proceeding: But yet what is still desired and wanted to make the Art of Gardening truly pleasant, fa&rehy;miliar, and entertaining, is <IT>the Order of Time</IT> too: To be <IT>led</IT>, as it were, by the Hand; to be directed and pointed to something to be done, not only each successive <IT>Year</IT>, but if pos&rehy;sible <IT>every Day</IT>, at least every <IT>Month</IT> in the Year, towards forwarding the natural Hopes of being rewarded with Fruit and Plenty.</P>
<PB N="4"><P>Such a Sort of <IT>Manuduction</IT> as this must needs be very desirable and easy to the Mind; and every true Lover of a Garden should methinks enter&rehy;tain such a <IT>Guide</IT> with Kindness and Candor; especially whilst nothing is offered to him <IT>choaking</IT> or <IT>unnatural</IT>; but all the Rules of Art, though con&rehy;firmed by long Experience, are sub&rehy;mitted to the common Reason and Judgment of Mankind, and every Man is left to the first Principle of human Nature, of <IT>judging for himself</IT>.
</P><P>What the mercenary Part of the Gardeners may think of this Method of treating the Subject, I cannot say. There are certainly some such <IT>narrow</IT> envious Spirits in the World, that would engross and monopolize all Knowledge; that would make others believe; that the <IT>particular Mystery</IT> is unintelligible; or at least not fit to be trusted with any but themselves. Where Tyranny and Ignorance pre&rehy;vail, this sort of <IT>Craft</IT> may easily be <PB
N="5">supposed to prevail also: But amongst us Protestants, where Learning and true Liberty prevail, if we can but keep where we are, no Subtilties or <IT>Crafts</IT> will be endured, that hinder the Progress of useful Learning, as well as true Religion.</P>
<P>I hope therefore it will not be made an Objection, that I have all along en&rehy;deavoured to make this Science <IT>plain</IT> and <IT>easy</IT>, and consequently <IT>intelligible</IT>; because the better it is understood, with so much the greater Success it will be practised, and the more improved; it being my constant Desire and Aim, that no one Person amongst <IT>Clergy</IT> and <IT>Laity</IT>, in whatsoever Part of this Island, may ever be deprived of the <IT>Pleasure</IT> or the <IT>Profit</IT> of a Fruitful Garden, for want of Rules and Instructions, or of knowing <IT>Times</IT> and <IT>Seasons</IT> when to put them in Practice. Or if I could but be so happy, as only to give some Hints, whereby further Improvements might be made, by the Experience and <PB
N="6">Ingenuity of others, I shall gain the Pleasure and the End I aim at.</P>
<P>There are some Terms and Expressi&rehy;ons yet remaining in our Language, with respect to Arts and Sciences, that have a very odd Sound, though per&rehy;haps no ill Meaning: As when we are told of a Company of the <IT>Mystery</IT> of Haberdashers or Merchant-Taylors, and Wardens of the <IT>Mystery</IT> of Mer&rehy;cers, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> I confess, if the Company of Gardeners should ever incorporate themselves into a Fraternity, I should be very sorry to hear them called, <IT>A Society of the Mystery of Gardening</IT>: Be&rehy;cause, however weak Minds may be brought to reverence what they do not understand, yet I cannot find that wise Men <IT>like</IT> any Thing the better for be&rehy;ing <IT>made</IT> mysterious or unintelligible; but rather the contrary; and are jea&rehy;lous of every Thing that looks like <IT>Art</IT> in <IT>hiding</IT> what <IT>ought to be</IT> known or explained. Howsoever, as far as in me lieth, I have endeavoured to <PB
N="7">shew that the Art of <IT>Gardening</IT> is no <IT>Mystery</IT>, no inaccessible <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Arcanum</FOREIGN>; but attainable by a few easy Rules, and a little Experience.</P>
<P>The Study of <IT>Vegetable Nature</IT> has indeed hitherto been too much neglect&rehy;ed: But as the most ingenious Mr. <IT>Bradley</IT> has now opened a new Scene of Philosophy in the Generation of Plants, it is to be hoped <IT>that</IT> Attempt will provoke other curious Observers to join with him in making further Experiments, and tracing the Opera&rehy;tions of Nature distinctly through its several Stages, from the <IT>Conception</IT> to the <IT>Birth</IT>.</P>
<P>When that <IT>Hypothesis</IT> is once fully settled, as it is now a highly probable one, we shall have a noble Foundation to build practical Truths upon; and it is easy to guess what surprizing and useful Inferences may be drawn from such a new Theory of Vegetable Na&rehy;ture.</P>
<PB N="8"><P>In the mean time, taking the Cir&rehy;culation of the Sap for a Thing granted, and built upon <IT>good Reason</IT>, as well as undeniable Experiments <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Besides the Experiment of the Circulation of the Sap in the strip'd Jessamine, mentioned in the 1st and 2d Part, I have since try'd to make an Incision in a strong Branch of a Pear-Tree, as far as the Pith, and afterwards split it Four or Five Inches upward, putting a small Stone in the Opening to continue the Gap. This succeeded as I expected; for at the Extremity of the Lip, where it was disjoined from the lower Part of the Branch, nature formed a weak bearing Branch; which could not otherwise be, but by means of the descend&rehy;ing Sap, as may be seen in <IT>Fig.</IT> 1 at A. The same also is proved by <IT>circumcising</IT> the Branch of a Pear, taking away three or four Inches of the Bark all round to the Wood: The Ef&rehy;fect whereof is, That the descending Sap swells very much the upper Part of the Wound at B in the same Figure; and is (I think) a Demonstration, that the Sap in a Pear, (and as far as I have observed in <IT>that</IT> alone) ascends in great Mea&rehy;sure through the Pith. For such a Branch will live and bear Fruit several Years.</NOTE>, I shall continue to proceed upon that <IT>Hypo&rehy;thesis</IT>, and with a constant View to <IT>That</IT>, shall venture to recommend those Rules and Directions to others, which have proved for many Years so successful to my self, under no very advantageous Circumstances of Soil and Situation.
<PB N="9"></P><P>This Subject, as I have observed above, I have already treated in <IT>the Order of Nature</IT>; and in that Treatise, I have study'd to use as few Words, as possible, and yet to express my self <IT>intelligibly</IT>. But if a further Enlarge&rehy;ment should seem necessary to <IT>some</IT>; I hope I have here supply'd that De&rehy;fect, now I come to speak in <IT>the Order of Time</IT>, which will lead me to say many Things before unthought of, and to insert some others not before sufficiently experienced.
</P><P>However, what I have chiefly had Regard to in my further Explications and more particular Rules, is the Ma&rehy;nagment of the <SC>Vine</SC>, that <IT>glorious</IT> Plant, which amongst all others, justly claims the <IT>Precedency</IT>, being esteem'd both by Ancients and Moderns, the King of the <IT>Vegetable</IT> Kingdom, as Man is of the <IT>Animal</IT>, and Gold of the <IT>Mineral</IT>. And that <IT>Honour and Precedency</IT> is the more aptly given to it as a King, if we consider how ana<PB
N="10">logous <IT>Plants</IT> are to <IT>Animals</IT>, accord&rehy;ing to the new System of the Circu&rehy;lation of Juices in Vegetables; and more so still, if their Method of <IT>Ge&rehy;neration</IT> given us by the afore-men&rehy;tioned Curious Gentleman, be ad&rehy;mitted.</P>
<P>This <IT>Royal Plant</IT>, I say, I shall all along treat according to its true Dig&rehy;nity and Worth, studying to explain and unfold its Nature, and laying down such particular Rules and Di&rehy;rections, that <IT>All</IT> may understand its Motions, and <IT>None</IT> be deprived of the Blessings and Rewards which it offers to all its Lovers and Ad&rehy;mirers.</P>
<P>There is the greater Need of having something of this Nature said and done; because there is a strange pre&rehy;vailing Notion got abroad, as if the greatest End and Use of planting a Vine, being a quick Grower, was to cover the Walls of the House with <PB
N="11">something Green, to make it look Pleasant and Beautiful to the Eye, without any great Prospect of reaping good or ripe Grapes from it. And indeed, according to the Observations that I have made, it is generally ma&rehy;naged accordingly, with great Disre&rehy;gard to any exact Pruning, or good Government.</P>
<P>This careless Management of the Vine, is yet but agreeable to the Views Men have in other Cases, whose Labour and Resolutions <IT>ordi&rehy;narily</IT> rise no higher than the Level of that Good, which is desired and hoped for. If the Expectations of Fruit from the Vine be languid and faint, who can hope that the Four several Prunings will be duly watch'd and regarded? And yet I am very well satisfied, that the general received Opinion is, that 'tis a vain Thing to expect good <IT>Grapes</IT>, when once you get Fifty or Sixty Miles <IT>North</IT> of <PB
N="12"><IT>London</IT> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">To this Error and Mistake, Sir <IT>William Temple</IT>, I doubt, has not a little contributed; when he so weakly argues and insinuates, as if neither good Peaches nor Grapes could rea&rehy;sonably be expected, when once you get beyond <IT>Northampton&rehy;shire</IT>, and commends the Prudence of his Friend in <IT>Stafford&rehy;shire</IT>; that planted only the best Plums against his <IT>South</IT> Walls. Where yet (as I am informed) there is excellent Fruit of all the best Sorts. See <IT>Garden of Epicurus</IT>, Page 116.</NOTE>; of if any one happen to succeed, <IT>That</IT> is commonly attri&rehy;buted to such kind and favourable Seasons, as are not <IT>ordinarily</IT> to be expected.</P>
<P>Now therefore, that I may at once strike off the main Force of this Ob&rehy;jection, and raise Mens Hopes and Expectations upon a Rational Foun&rehy;dation in order to Practice, I shall here subjoin an exact Calculation of the several Degrees of the Sun's Heat, answerable to the several Degrees of Latitude, between 44&deg; and 56&deg;, whereby at one View it may easily be discerned, what Proportion of Heat is lost or got by going <IT>Northward</IT> or <IT>Southward</IT>.</P>
<PB N="13"><P>But because I am obliged to my Good and Learned Friend Mr. <IT>Whi&rehy;ston</IT>, for his kind Letter and Tables upon this Occasion, I shall make use of his Leave to insert them at Length.
</P><QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><SALUTE><IT>Dear Sir</IT>,</SALUTE><P>"&Iic; Have considered the Problem you desired the Solution of from me, and have perused the Learned Dr. <IT>Halley's</IT> Account of the same in the Philosophical Trans&rehy;actions, <IT>Numb.</IT> 203. And the Re&rehy;sult of my Enquiry is this: That the Quantity of Heat derived from the Sun is <IT>always</IT> as the Squares of the Sines of the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon, <IT>i.e.</IT> that the Quantity or Number of its Rays is still as the Sines of that Altitude; and the particular Force of each Ray, or equal Quantity of Rays (which when more oblique are <PB
N="14">weaker and more Perpendicular are stronger) is in the same Pro&rehy;portion of the Sines also: Which equal Proportions, when com&rehy;pounded, do constitute the Pro&rehy;portion of the Squares of those Sines. Upon which Foot I have set down Tables of the Quantity of Heat derived from the Sun at Noon on the longest Day, <IT>June</IT> 10. At the Sun's Entrance into <IT>Taurus</IT> and <IT>Virgo, April</IT> 10. and <IT>August</IT> 12. And on the <IT>Equinox</IT>-Days, <IT>March</IT> 10. and <IT>September</IT> 12. for the several Latitudes from Forty Four to Fifty Six; or from the La&rehy;titude of <IT>Montpelier</IT> in the <IT>South</IT> of <IT>France</IT>, to that of <IT>Edinburgh</IT> in <IT>Scot&rehy;land</IT>; which will be sufficient for an Estimate of the <IT>Summer</IT> Quan&rehy;tity of this Heat in general for the same Latitudes, or so far as the ripening of <IT>Summer</IT> Fruits is con&rehy;cerned: And it will abundantly prove what you aim at; <IT>viz.</IT> That <PB
N="15">'tis not the proper Weakness of the Sun's Heat, that hinders those Fruits from ripening tolerably well in the Middle, or even somewhat <IT>Northern</IT> Parts of <IT>England</IT>, which are known to come to considerable Perfection in the Southern Parts of it: Since it is evident by these Ta&rehy;bles, that the Difference of an entire Degree in these Parts, is but about the Fifty Sixth Part of the whole Solstitial Heat in <IT>June</IT>; but about the Thirty Fifth Part of the other in <IT>April</IT> and <IT>August</IT>; and no more than the Twenty Third Part, even in <IT>March</IT> and <IT>September</IT>, when it is largest: Which seems to be too small to be of very great Conse&rehy;quence in that Matter. The other Occasions of Variety of Heat in several Countries, are generally ob&rehy;vious, and do not come under our present Consideration. I am, Sir, a hearty Well-wisher to your useful Designs of improving and recom<PB

<P><IT>N.B.</IT> The following Tables and Calculation, though they shew the real Difference of the Sun's <IT>Meridian</IT> Heat in different Latitudes; yet do not account for the greater Number of Hours of the Sun being above the Horizon, which a <IT>Northern</IT> Latitude has more than a <IT>Southern</IT> one; which yet is to my present Purpose to observe. I shall only therefore inform the Rea&rehy;der in General, and by one round Number, That during all the <IT>Summer</IT> Season (the Time of ripening Fruits) betwixt the Two <IT>Equinoxes</IT>, there are no less than One Hundred Hours of Sunshine at <IT>Durham</IT>, more than there are at <IT>Plimouth</IT>, as might easily be shewn by a particular Table.</P>

<PB N="18"></P><P>By these Tables it manifestly ap&rehy;pears, that though Two or Three De&rehy;grees of Latitude do produce <IT>some</IT>, and that a <IT>Mathematical</IT> Difference in the Degrees of Heat and Cold; yet that <IT>that</IT> Difference is but small, much less considerable than is commonly thought, and consequently that there is more Weight laid upon that Diffe&rehy;rence than it will bear, when a Gen&rehy;tleman suffers himself to be discou&rehy;raged from Planting and Managing Peaches and Vines; because he hap&rehy;pens to live under Fifty Three of Fifty Four Degrees of Latitude.
</P><P>For my Part, I am so sensible how little there is in that Disadvantage, that if the Rules I have laid down for managing a Vine be but followed, I am sanguine enough to hope for Suc&rehy;cess, even in the most <IT>Northern</IT> Parts of this Kingdom; and I own it is with Pleasure, that I expect to hear of good Grapes at <IT>York</IT> and <IT>Durham</IT>, too.</P>
<PB N="19"><P><IT>N.B.</IT> In this Calculation no No&rehy;tice is taken of the Advantages and Dis&rehy;advantages of <IT>good</IT> and <IT>bad</IT> Soils, of <IT>kind</IT> and <IT>unkind</IT> Climates and Situa&rehy;tions; because, though these are in themselves of the last Consequence, and are indeed chiefly to be regarded; yet do not they come under the afore&rehy;going Disquisition; but are to be con&rehy;sidered <IT>separately</IT> and <IT>apart</IT>: Inasmuch as a bad Soil and Situation may fall to the Share of him who lives near <IT>Canter&rehy;bury</IT>, and a good one to him that lives near <IT>York</IT>.
</P><P>The former Calculation therefore is supposed to be made under the same or equal Circumstances of Soil and Climate. But then what I would add here is this: That we unjustly com&rehy;plain of a <IT>Northern</IT> Climate, when the chief Misfortune (to say nothing here of bad Pruning) is owing to a bad Soil and Situation, to cold Springs and Clays, subject to Currents of Winds <PB
N="20">betwixt Ridges of Hills, open to the <IT>North, East</IT>, or <IT>West</IT>.</P>
<P>That these are the Evils chiefly to be dreaded and guarded against, if possible, may appear from the want of <IT>good</IT> and <IT>late</IT> Fruit in <IT>Cornwal</IT>, and some Parts of <IT>Devonshire</IT>, open to the cold Winds; and the Plenty of it to be had in <IT>Worcestershire</IT> and <IT>Hereford&rehy;shire</IT>, Two Degrees more <IT>North</IT>. Though indeed it is a Reproach to those Two last named Counties, the very Garden of <IT>England</IT>, that they do not more encourage Vineyards, and the later Fruits; not seeming to know the Felicity they enjoy of the <IT>best</IT> Soil and Climate, and of their being so happily guarded on all dangerous Sides by Hills, and yet open to the <IT>South</IT>.</P>
<P>This however, is to my present Pur&rehy;pose to observe, that though there is some small <IT>Disadvantage</IT> attends every Degree of more <IT>Northern Latitude</IT>; yet even Three of Four of those De&rehy;grees are by no means so considerable <PB
N="21">a Discouragement (nor ought to be accounted so) as a wet Soil, a cold Clay, and a bad Climate, whereso&rehy;ever they happen; I shall therefore venture to say, because I am sup&rehy;ported by experimental Knowledge in saying it; That a warm Sand or Gra&rehy;vel on a favourable Situation, as far <IT>North</IT> as <IT>Nottingham</IT> or <IT>York</IT>, is much rather to be chosen, because more agreeable and assisting to late Fruits, than a deep Clay unguarded from the <IT>North</IT> Winds, as far <IT>South</IT> as <IT>Exeter</IT> or <IT>Plimouth</IT>.</P>
<P>For indeed there is a greater Disad&rehy;vantage attends a wet cold Soil than most are aware of; because the very Climate in some Cases is affected from the Nature of the Soil, as I have my self had but too fatal Experience; the hovering cold Dews and Frosts <IT>here</IT> coming on sooner in <IT>Autumn</IT>, and continuing later in the <IT>Spring</IT>; where&rehy;by I have not only been deprived of at least a Month of that Summer, <PB
N="22">which most of my Neighbours have enjoyed; but have often lost the tender Shoots and Fruit of Vines and Figs in the <IT>Spring</IT>, and <IT>much</IT> of their Fruit in <IT>Autumn</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>N.B.</IT> The aforegoing Calculation doth not respect any extraordinary Cases of Artificial Fires, or other Helps to accelerate the Growth of Nature: For these may be had in any Latitude with Care and Charge, and are, to be sure, most wanted in the <IT>North</IT>, and in bad Soils, to ripen the later Fruits.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that his Grace the Duke of <IT>Rutland</IT>, at his Seat at <IT>Belvoir</IT> Castle in <IT>Lincolnshire</IT>, has done so much Justice to the Vine, as to have these <IT>Artificial</IT> Fires con&rehy;stantly burning behind his slope Walls from <IT>Lady-Day</IT> to <IT>Michaelmas</IT>; where&rehy;by he is rewarded with the largest Grapes, and even the <IT>best Frontignacs</IT> in <IT>July</IT>.</P>
<PB N="23"><P>I have not my self seen them; but it is easy to conceive, that by the Help of Stoves at convenient Distances, and Cavities in the Structure of the Wall to convey the Heat to all Parts, the desirable Purpose of <IT>early, large</IT> and <IT>good</IT> Grapes must be attained; espe&rehy;cially if the constant Care of Matting them a' Nights be not neglected; without which all would quickly be spoiled by the Cold and <IT>Perpendicular</IT> Dews or Frosts, that fall so frequently in <IT>April</IT> and <IT>May</IT>.
</P><P>Neither is the Charge of this, as I am informed, so considerable as might be thought; for in a Country of Coals, where a Wagon-Load of the small Sort may be had and brought for Two or Three Shillings, it cannot be supposed to be a great Charge to have Ten or Twelve Stoves constantly burning for Six Months. The most material Thing seems to be the Atten&rehy;dance required: And yet <IT>that</IT> need be look'd upon as only part of the <PB
N="24"><IT>Meloniere</IT>, and may be managed by the same Hand, and at the same Times.</P>
<P>Something analogous to this, is a Method that might be practised; of laying large Heaps of long Dung be&rehy;hind a Wall of Vines, which by fre&rehy;quent stirring and repeating, will have the same Effect as a gentle Fire; and if it might be so contrived, as to have the Garden-Wall where the Vines grow, near the Stable, the Trouble would be little or nothing, but the Advantage every way very conside&rehy;rable; still remembring, that if the Vines by any artificial Heat, shoot out before their natural Time, great Care must be used to guard them a' Nights from the Frosts, till <IT>April</IT> and some part of <IT>May</IT> be over.</P>
<P>But what Methods soever are pra&rehy;ctised for accelerating the Growth of Vines by <IT>artificial</IT> Heats, it may not be improper to add in this Place; that it is of the last Consequence to follow <PB
N="25">exactly the Rules of Art in <IT>pruning</IT> them: Forasmuch as great <IT>Care, At&rehy;tendance</IT>, and <IT>Charge</IT> is used for the attaining the End of getting <IT>good</IT> and <IT>early</IT> Grapes, the more of <IT>these</IT> are procured in a small Compass the bet&rehy;ter; and therefore it would be inex&rehy;cuseable to have any part of such Walls as <IT>these especially</IT>, unfurnished with Fruit; which yet, I doubt, is a Thing not sufficiently considered by those, who are willing to spare no Cost to get good Grapes: Whilst they seem satisfied with having a tolerable Quan&rehy;tity on each Vine; when yet, it may be, the same Quantity of good Ones might be had in half the Room.</P>
<P>Which leads me here by the way to remark also, That I could never yet find, that the Vine can <IT>ordinarily</IT> bear <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="foot">But this observation is to be restrained to the Vine on&rehy;ly: All other Fruits (as far as I have observed) do really suffer as to their Taste and Goodness, from too great Plenty.</NOTE> too much Fruit, its great Plen&rehy;ty of Sap affording always sufficient <PB
N="26">Nourishment for the greatest Abun&rehy;dance; especially if all the fruitless Branches be removed, as they ought, and as will be directed in its proper Place.</P>
<P><IT>N.B.</IT> If all the afore-going Ad&rehy;vantages of Soil, Situation, and Cli&rehy;mate, were well considered and im&rehy;proved, I do not see but it must turn to very good Account to plant a con&rehy;venient well-sheltered Spot of Gound, to be ordered in the Method of a Vineyard for making Wine; the Fruit whereof by the help of a very small Quantity of new Raisons, might certainly be made to answer to very good Purpose.</P>
<P>I cannot tell but the <IT>South</IT>-Side of a chalky Hill may do: but I should ra&rehy;ther chuse an untry'd hot Sand or Gra&rehy;vel not over-rich, for this Reason; be&rehy;cause <IT>this</IT> will retain the Heat of the Sun much longer, even so as to con&rehy;tinue warm in the Absence of the Sun; and consequently the <IT>circumam&rehy;bient</IT> Air will be in a great Measure affected therewith.</P>
<PB N="27"><P>I am satisfied there is more in what I now say than is commonly thought; because I have frequently observed the happy Consequences of a warm Gra&rehy;vel or Sand, how that it hath really defended what has grown upon it from the Injury of those Frosts, which have made terrible Havock in other Neigh&rehy;bouring Places. The great Misfor&rehy;tune which we in this Island suffer, with Respect to our late Fruits, is the <IT>Unconstancy of the Weather</IT>, and <IT>great Difference</IT> oftentimes betwixt our <IT>Nights</IT> and <IT>Days</IT>, as to <IT>Heat</IT> and <IT>Cold</IT>; for we do not seem so much to want <IT>hotter Days</IT>, as <IT>less cold Nights</IT>: But it is plain from <IT>Fact</IT> and <IT>Experience</IT>, that those <IT>Inequalities</IT> are not near so great and considerable in a <IT>dry warm</IT> Soil, as they are in a <IT>cold wet</IT> one. And yet (as I apprehend) no better Reason can be assigned for it, than that the one retains the Effect of the Heat of the Day and the Sun's Beams <IT>longer</IT>, and consequently makes the whole Air <PB
N="28"><IT>warmer</IT> in the Absence of the Sun, than the other.
</P><P>To the happy Influence of this it must be assigned also as the Cause, why those perpendicular Frosts or Mists, which fall so frequently in <IT>Spring</IT> and <IT>Autumn</IT>, do not <IT>here</IT> fall so plentifully, nor cause such fatal Destruction: <IT>Such</IT> indeed as must in <IT>other</IT> Places be carefully guarded against with <IT>Horizontal Shelters</IT>, if tender or late Fruit be expected.</P>
<P>However, still we shall but deceive our selves, if we trust too much to the happy Influence of a good Soil: I am now only speaking of what is <IT>comparatively Good</IT>; of what is to be chosen with all the Skill and Discreti&rehy;on imaginable, in the Case of plant&rehy;ing a Vineyard especially. But were it any way practicable, nothing could more effectually bring <IT>Italy</IT> into <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, than a Contrivance to take off more of the Influence of our cold Nights and uncertain Weather. This <PB
N="29">I am perswaded might, in good Mea&rehy;sure, be done with no great Charge or Trouble, by means of low ordinary Espaliers about Two Foot high, along the several Rows of Vines, to which their Shoots might be carried <IT>horizon&rehy;tally</IT> and fastened, and the Fruit it self likewise defended by <IT>Horizontal Shel&rehy;ters</IT>, fix'd on the Top of the Espa&rehy;liers, made of coarse narrow Planks with a convex Superficies to throw off the Wet; as may be seen more plainly <IT>Fig.</IT> 2. <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="foot">But a cheaper way still, and as effectual, would be to fa&rehy;sten narrow Mats of Straw or Rushes Four or Five Inches wide on the Top of the Espalier, running <IT>East</IT> and <IT>West</IT>.</NOTE></P>
<P>I cannot but think some such Me&rehy;thod as this might be of singular Use to remedy the Inequalities of our Cli&rehy;mate, and help us to such <IT>fruitful</IT> Vine&rehy;yards, as may afford the same good Wine, which we so <IT>eagerly</IT> seek for Abroad with greater Charge.</P>
<P>I am throughly convinced how ea&rehy;sily good and ripe Grapes may be had <PB
N="30">in a Vineyard <IT>artfully</IT> chosen and well guarded, from what I saw the last Year, (and that no very favourable one) in the Garden of that Ingenious Encourager of Vegetable Nature, Mr. <IT>Balle</IT> at <IT>Kensington</IT>, who for a Trial has planted a little Spot with Vines in his Garden; Three or Four Shoots from every Plant were supported with Props: And when I was there in the Beginning of <IT>November</IT>, I saw some very fair Bunches of the blue <IT>Fronti&rehy;niac</IT> tolerably ripe, managed accord&rehy;ing to Art, by Mr. <IT>Bradley</IT> himself. Some of <IT>these</IT> indeed he told me were planted there by Mistake: But I only infer from thence, what excellent Fruit must be had, and may ordinari&rehy;ly be expected, from the black Clusters and Muscadines, that are so much earlier ripe.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, since I have so <IT>heartily</IT> recommended the planting Vines in all advantageous Soils and Si&rehy;tuations, and have encouraged even <PB
N="31">the making Vineyards in <IT>some</IT> of the best and most <IT>Southern</IT> Parts, I shall think my self obliged to be more than ordinary Particular in my Directions how to manage them; not only, be&rehy;cause <IT>they</IT> most of all <IT>expect</IT> and <IT>need</IT> constant Pruning; but because I cannot find, that <IT>that</IT> Care and At&rehy;tendance is <IT>ordinarily</IT> given them, which is so absolutely necessary to the Production of <IT>good</IT> and <IT>ripe</IT> Grapes. But neither shall I forget what I have promised: To lay down such plain Directions and Rules for the Govern&rehy;ment of a Fruit-Garden in all the Ar&rehy;ticles of it, that the practical Part of Gardening may become as <IT>easy</IT> and <IT>familiar</IT>, as the Theory is delight&rehy;ful and entertaining to all.</P></DIV></BODY>
