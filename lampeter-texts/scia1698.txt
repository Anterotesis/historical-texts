<P>&Tic;HE design of the Ensu&rehy;ing Treatise, is a short Account of the Nature and Use of Maps; a knowledge of great advantage to several sorts of People; and the princi&rehy;pal branch of that noble Science of <RO>Geography</RO>, which informs you in the Nature, Property and Magnitude, not only of the whole <RO>Earth</RO>, but also of each <PB
N="[ii]">distinct and particular part thereof.
</P><P>For by this Science the <RO>Di&rehy;vine, Merchant, Souldier</RO>, and <RO>Traveller</RO>, may (without danger of those apparent ha&rehy;zards they are like to fall un&rehy;der) take a particular View of those vast and pleasant Countries, they have occasion to visit or mention in their several Voca&rehy;tions. Such, with many other, are the advantages of this Ex&rehy;cellent Science. But leaving this, I shall give you a short ac&rehy;count of the <CORR
SIC="ensuiug">ensuing</CORR> Treatise, which as the Title informs you, is the Nature and use of Maps, <PB
N="[iii]">in which I have incerted such Discourses as is requisite to give you a clear understanding of the Nature and Reason of their pro&rehy;jection: Next I proceed to their Use, in knowing how to find out any place, by the most practical and Common Methods yet known; and also how to Mea&rehy;sure the Distance betwixt two places when found in any Map; with other pleasant Accounts of the Distinction and Division of the Earth into <RO>Zones, Climates</RO> and <RO>Parallels</RO>.</P>
<P>Lastly, I have added a Cata&rehy;logue of the Places and Facto&rehy;ries now in possession of the <PB

<HEAD>OF THE <BO>EARTH</BO>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HE <IT>Earth</IT> was in the Beginning, by Command of the Most High, created out of a <IT>Chaos</IT>, or a con&rehy;fused Heap, which before had no Form, and was made a Habitation for Man to dwell upon, that, for a time, he might Contemplate upon the inferiour Works of his Creator. The Description of this Earth is termed <IT>Geography</IT>, and the Fi&rehy;gure that the Earth and Water do toge&rehy;ther Constitute, is, by many Observati&rehy;ons and Experiments prov'd to be round, or in form of a Globe, hanging by no&rehy;thing in the Air, and by the most Accu&rehy;rate Observations its Circumference, is found near 24971 <IT>English</IT> Miles, and consequently its Diameter 7291 of the said Miles, as has been found by the late Experiments of several Nations. The <PB
N="2">greatest part of this Globe is covered with Water, for ought we yet know, which at the Creation, by the Almigh&rehy;ty Decree, was gathered into one place, call'd the <IT>Sea</IT>: This Ball, or Globe, of Earth and Water, is covered with a thin subtile matter, call'd <IT>Air</IT>, by which it is rendred Habitable, in the Center of this Globe, is an <CORR
SIC="Actractive">Attractive</CORR> Power, by ver&rehy;tue whereof all heavy Bodies, though loosed from it, will again return and cling to it, by which faculty 'tis defen&rehy;ded from Dissolution, in not permiting the least part thereof to be seperated from it.
</P><P>This Globe by its (or the Suns) two&rehy;fold motion, enjoys the grateful Vicis&rehy;situdes of Day and Night, Winter and Summer; the first, by turning upon its own Axis once in 24 Hours, and the second, by having the said Axis car&rehy;ried about the Sun in the space of one Year, by some unknown prin&rehy;ciple of Nature, during the time of its other Revolution; and this Axis not being perpendicular to the plain, in which the said Annual Motion is performed, causeth one Hemisphere to have more of the Sun's Light for one half Year, and the other Hemisphere for the other.</P>
<PB N="3"><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">Arguments for proving the Spherick, or Globular from of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>&Aic; Globe, or Sphere, is a perfect round solid Body, contained un&rehy;der one Surface, in the midst of which is a point call'd the <IT>Center</IT>, from whence all Lines drawn to the out-side are equal; these Lines are termed <IT>Semidiameters</IT>.
</P><P>Of this Form and Figure is the whole Earth and Sea, as we have reason to con&rehy;clude, from several undoubted Obser&rehy;vations and Experiments, the principal of which follows.</P>
<P><IT>First</IT>, Eclipses of the Moon which are caused by the Earths coming be&rehy;twixt the Sun and Her; for the Moon having no light, but what she receives from the Sun, is hindred of it by the Opaque Body of the Earth, who inter&rehy;posing betwixt the Sun and Moon, casts her shaddow upon the Moon, which to us appears Circular thereon; and there&rehy;fore, according to <IT>Optick</IT> Principles, the Earth from whence it proceeds, is a Sphe&rehy;rick or Globular Body.</P>
<PB N="4"><P><IT>Secondly</IT>, Eclipses of the Sun, which are caused by the Moon's passing betwixt him and those places where he ap&rehy;pears Eclipsed; for unless the Earth were Globular, as Astronomers have assumed it, the time when, and place where, So&rehy;lar Eclipses should happen, could not be determin'd; but seeing both time and place is nicely limited, their suppositi&rehy;on of the Earth's roundness must needs be true.
</P><P><IT>Thirdly</IT>, Because of the <IT>Phenomenaelig;</IT> do Rise, Culminate, and Set, sooner to the <IT>Eastern</IT> then to <IT>Western</IT> Inhabitants, as has been observed by those who have carri&rehy;ed correct Time-keepers to Sea, and this proportionally according to the roundness of the Earth.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Viewing from the shoar a Ship a good distance from you, at first you shall only perceive her Top-sails, but as she approaches nearer, you shall see her Lower-sails, and at last her Hull, which I think is an Evident Proof of the Earth's Sphericity; for did not the Glo&rehy;bosity of the Water interpose betwixt our sight and the Ship, we might more easily see her Hull than her Top-sails at first.</P>
<PB N="5"><P><IT>Fifthly</IT>, Our Modern Navigators, in their Voyages, especially, those that have been made round the World by <IT>Drake</IT> and <IT>Cavendish</IT>, make it very ap&rehy;parent; for sailing <IT>Eastward</IT>, they have, without turning back, arived to the place from whence they first set Sail, on&rehy;ly they came short home by one Day and Night, that is, they were absent 24 Hours more by their own reckoning, than by the account of them kept at Home, which thing further Confirms the Earth's Sphericity.
</P><P><IT>Sixthly</IT>, It is found by daily Practice, that the Degrees of every parallel upon Earth, have the same proportion to the Degrees of the Equinoctial, as the Degrees of the like parallel of an Artifi&rehy;cial Globe, has to a Degree of the Equi&rehy;noctial thereon described.</P>
<P><IT>Seventhly</IT> and <IT>Lastly</IT>, Common Expe&rehy;rience shows us, That sailing, or going towards the <IT>North</IT>, we raise the <IT>North&rehy;Pole</IT>, and <IT>Northern Stars</IT>, and on the contrary, do depress the <IT>South-Pole</IT> and <IT>Southern Stars</IT>, the <IT>North</IT> Elevation en&rehy;creasing equally with the <IT>South</IT> Depres&rehy;sion, and both proportional according to the distance sailed, the like happens in <PB
N="6">sailing <IT>Southwards</IT>; besides, the Oblique Ascention, Descentions, Amplitude of rise&rehy;ing and seting of the Sun, Moon and Stars, would be the same in all places, were not the Earth Globular.</P>
<P>And it may further be observable, that was not the Earth Globular, but a long Round-flat, as some have foolishly im&rehy;agined, then these absurdities would follow, <IT>viz.</IT></P>
<P>The Elevation of the Pole, and Height of the Stars, would be the same in all places.</P>
<P>The same appearance of the Heavens would be to all Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The Sun, Moon and Stars would Rise, Culminate, and Set, to all places at the same time.</P>
<P>Eclipses would appear to all People at the same time.</P>
<P>The Days and Nights would be of the same length to all parts, neither would there be Day in one place, when there is Night in another.</P>
<P>Shadows would be alike in all places, that is, all of them would be one way, neither would one Country be Hotter or Colder than another.</P>
<PB N="7"><P>But though we thus endeavour to prove the Earth round, yet it must not <CORR
SIC="strickly">strictly</CORR> be taken, as if there were no in&rehy;equalities of its Surface; for the Moun&rehy;tains, Hills and Vallies, which are so common in most parts of it, cause some Irregularities and Cragginess in the Sur&rehy;face; yet because the greatness of these inequalities have scarce any sensible pro&rehy;portion to the whole, the height of the highest Mountain being not 1/6000 part of its Diameter, which is inconsiderable; and therefore notwithstanding these small Irregularities, we may affirm the Earth to be round, or in form of a Globe, or Sphere.
&horbar;</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">Of the Measure of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HE Earth and Water being of this Form, we shall in the next place enquire into its Extent, for the effecting of which, several Essays have been made, to find either its Circumference or Dia&rehy;meter; for when one of them is gotten, the other is easily known, and by ha&rehy;ving them both, its Surface and Solidi&rehy;ty may be nicely Discovered.
<PB N="8"></P><P>Now, as their Conclusions has been different, so has the ways by which they have endeavoured to attain them. <IT>Eratosthenes's</IT> way was by the Sun-beams, and Shade of a Stile, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">vid.</FOREIGN> Deschale's use of</IT> 29. 1 <IT>Euc. Maurolycus</IT> Abbot of <IT>Mes&rehy;suva</IT>, his way was by finding the Quan&rehy;tity of the Angle, made by two lines drawn from the Surface of the Earth, to the top of any high Hill, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">vid.</FOREIGN> Deschale's</IT> use of the 6. 2. <IT>Euc.</IT> A third way was by Eclipses, which is very uncertain. for a small mistake in the times of Obser&rehy;vation at one or both of the places, will cause a very great and sensible Error, in the Distances of the said places.
</P><P>A Fourth and surest way which has been try'd by most Nations, is, that of measuring <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT> under one Meridian, some good large Distance, <IT>viz.</IT> one or two Hundred Miles; for in those Observations of small Distances, there can be no certain Conclusion. The me&rehy;thod of doing this, is either with an In&rehy;strument and Chain, or else with a <IT>Pe&rehy;rambulator</IT>, or measuring Wheel, which after 'tis actually taken, must with great care be plotted down upon Paper, but not without allowing for the Variation <PB
N="9">of the Needle, and all notable Ascents and Descents with other turnings and windings, that will of necessity be met with in the way, and so by this means we shall come to know how many Miles on the Earth will answer to a Degree in the Heavens, provided an exact Obser&rehy;vation by a large Quadrant, or other In&rehy;strument, be made to find the Latitude of the place we begin to measure from, and the Latitude of the place we measure to.</P>
<P>According to this Method, did Mr. <IT>Richard Norwood</IT>, a good Mathematician, and an able Sea-man, in the Year 1635. make an Experiment in measuring the Distance betwixt <IT>London</IT> and <IT>York</IT>, by which he found one Degree upon Earth, that is, the 1/360 part of the Circumfe&rehy;rence of the Earth to contain 69 4/11 <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> miles (each <IT>English</IT> Mile contain&rehy;ing 5280 Feet) and consequently the whole Circumference of the Earth 24971 <IT>English</IT> Miles, and its Diameter 7291 of the same. From these Dimensions will the Area of the Surface of the whole Globe of Earth and Water be found to be 197795291 square <IT>English</IT> Miles, and its solid Content 261089784120 Cu<PB
N="10">bical <IT>English</IT> Miles, which account doth likewise nearly agree with the <IT>Dutch</IT> and <IT>French</IT>.</P>

<P>&Tic;HE Earth being in the Form be&rehy;fore Described, Astronomers have form'd an Artificial one in representation thereof, on which they have Pictured both Sea and Land in all their parts, and according to their Scituation so far as is known, a type of which is here deline&rehy;ated, where the straight Line 90.90.90 in one Hemisphere is the Axis of the of the World, the Arches 80.80; 70.70; <IT>&amp;c.</IT> encreasing in bigness are parallels of La&rehy;titude, and the Arches 90.80.90; 90.70.90, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> are our Circles, or Meri&rehy;dians; among which is one that is the outermost which is as it were the Land&rehy;mark of the whole Sphere, being the bounds from whence the Longitude of any particular place is accounted quite round the Globe.
</P><P>Now this Meridian from whence we begin to reckon the Longitude, has been differently assigned by several Nations, for the <IT>Arabian</IT> and <IT>Nubian</IT> Geographers, place it at the utmost Extremity of the <IT>Western</IT> shoar.</P>
<PB N="11"><P><IT>Ortelius</IT>, in his Sheet-Map of <IT>Europe</IT>, makes <IT>London</IT> to lie in 28 Degrees, but in his Sheet-Map of <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Belgia</IT>, it lies but in 21 Degrees of Longitude; so that where he begins his Longitude, is not exactly known.
</P><P>The <IT>Spaniards</IT>, since the <IT>West-Indies</IT> Conquest, begins at <IT>Toledo</IT>, and contra&rehy;ry to all other Accounts, reckon their Longitude is from <IT>East</IT> to <IT>West</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Blaew</IT>, the <IT>Dutch</IT> Geographer, begins his at <IT>Teneriff</IT>, the most Noted of the <IT>Ca&rehy;nary</IT> Islands, though on his large Map of the World, he makes it pass through <IT>Tercera</IT>, one of the <IT>Azores</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Sansoon</IT>, the <IT>French</IT> Geographer, begins his at <IT>Ferro</IT>, one of the <IT>Canaries</IT>: Our late Geographers, especially the <IT>English</IT>, place it in the <IT>Azores</IT>, some beginning at <IT>Tercera</IT>, others at <IT>Corvo</IT>, a third at <IT>Gra&rehy;tiosia</IT>; though upon our new sort of Globes, and some late Maps, it is made to pass through the <IT>Westermost</IT> part of St. <IT>Michaels</IT>.</P>
<P>So that Longitude is the distance of a place reckoned in the Equator, from the Meridian, which passes through that place you begin your Longitude from.</P>
<PB N="12"><P><IT>Latitude</IT> is the nearest distance of a place from the Equator, or the height of Pole above the Horizon.
</P><P><IT>Continent</IT>, is a great part of the Habi&rehy;table Earth that lies together, not being divided by the Sea; such is the whole <IT>Continent</IT> of <IT>Europe, Asia</IT> and <IT>Africa</IT>, as likewise <IT>America</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Island</IT>, is a piece of land Environ'd quite round with Water, as <IT>Great Bri&rehy;tain, Ireland</IT>, &amp;c.</P>

<P><IT>Peninsula</IT>, is almost an Island, being that which is so tied to the <IT>Continent</IT> by an <IT>Isthmus</IT>; such is <IT>Affrica</IT> and <IT>Morea</IT>.</P>
<P>A <IT>Promontory</IT>, or <IT>Cape</IT>, is a high Land bending or running out into the Sea; such is the Cape of St. <IT>Vincent's</IT>, Cape of <IT>Good Hope</IT>, &amp;c.</P>

<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">A short Description of the making and projecting of Circular Maps.</HEAD>
<P>&Mic;APS are only the Pictures, or Representations of any part, or parts, of the Globe in Plano, that is, they are a Perspective Draught either of the whole, or else some particular place, or part of the Earth: For suppose the Earth was Transparent, and the Eye to be placed some where in the Equator, and that at Right Angles, to the Line passing from the Eye to the opposite part of the Earth, a Plain be conceived to be placed cuting the Earth into two equal Parts, that is passing through the Earth's Cen&rehy;ter; then I say, if from the Eye Rays be im&rehy;agined to pass thro' the said Plain, to eve&rehy;ry Physical Point in the obverse Hemi&rehy;sphere of the Earth, these Lines shall pro&rehy;ject Points upon the said Plain, which, if join'd, will give the true Picture of one <PB
N="15">half of the places on the Earth's Surface. And because, but one half of a Globe is to be seen at one time, therfore if you desire a Representation of the whole Terraqueous Globe, it must be done in two Hemispheres.
</P><P>According to this Representation, there is Geometrick Rules laid down, for Projecting and Delineating the Cir&rehy;cles and Lines as they thus appear to the Eye, whether 'tis upon the plain of a Meridian, which makes the common Hemispheres, or else upon the Equator, which is that we call the <IT>Polar</IT> Pro&rehy;jection, because the Eye is supposed in the Pole? And this Projection is almost as frequent as the other.</P>
<P>As for the Geometrick Directions, for teaching how to draw these Circles and Lines, as they thus appear to the Eye, either upon the plain of the Meridian, or Equator, I shall not here show, be&rehy;cause it properly belongs to the Projecti&rehy;on of the Sphere.</P>
</DIV><PB N="16"><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">How to lay down places upon the Hemispheres.</HEAD>
<P>&Bic;UT supposing it done, I shall di&rehy;rect you how to lay down places upon the Hemispheres, having therefore compleated a Projection of the Imagina&rehy;ry Circles, <IT>viz.</IT> Equator, Meridian, Par&rehy;rallels, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> as in the annexed Map of the World may be seen; consider that the Longitude and Latitude of any place is determined by the Meridian, and Pa&rehy;rallel of that place, so that having the Longitude and Latitude of any place, we may incert it in the Map thus: Count from the Meridian, or outermost Circle on the Equator, the Longitude of the place you desire to Express, so shall you thereby find the Meridian of that place; Then among the Parallels find the Latitude of that place, and in the point where the Meridian and Parallel intersect, is the place to be put in the Hemisphere.
</P><P>By this Artifice, may the one half of the Earth's Surface, by taking several points, be delineated in Plano, just as <PB
N="17">it appears to the Eye in the aforesaid Po&rehy;sition, and after the like manner is the other Hemisphere to be projected.</P>
<P>If you would make a Map, but of some large part of the Earth, such as <IT>Europe, Asia, Germany, Spain, France</IT>, &amp;c. the method and manner of doing it, is the same with the preceding, only in this case, the projection is made much larger, and then cut off in a square form to such Latitude and Longitude, as will contain the extream Latitudes and Lon&rehy;gitudes of that portion of the Earth you design a Map off. After the same manner may you divide it, if it be a Map of <IT>Europe, Asia</IT>, &amp;c. into its Em&rehy;pires, Kingdoms and Provinces, by laying down the Latitudes and Longitudes thereof.</P>

<P>&Mic;APS that are Projected after this way, ought to be but of small places, that is, such which have scarce a sensible proportion to the whole Surface of the Earth, else they will be very Erronious, because the least portion of the Earth's Surface is Spherical, which, if we consider, and take for plain, as we do in this Case, must needs be false; but for small places lying either upon the Equator, or within few Degrees of it, they may without much Error be thus Represented, their Surface being very little differing from a true Plain.
</P><P>In order therefore to make a Map of some such place, consider both the dif&rehy;ference of <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT> of the extream parts thereof; As suppose I would make a Map of a place, whose diffe&rehy;rence of <IT>Longitude</IT> is 4 Degrees, and the difference of <IT>Latitudes</IT>, if they were both <IT>North</IT> or <IT>South</IT> (else the sum of them) 6 Degrees; draw a blind Line, then take <PB
N="19">any length for a Degree, which let be as large as you please, for the larger the better: This length prick off 4 times on the said Line, for your Degrees of <IT>Longi&rehy;tude</IT>, after which raise a Perpendicular, and take the same distance as before, and run off 6 times upon it, this done, com&rehy;pleat the Parallelogram, whose sides in this Case, will be as 6 to 4, that is, the <IT>Latitude</IT> is 6 Degrees, and the <IT>Longitude</IT> 4, and this finishes the Limits of your <IT>Map</IT>.</P>
<P>It will be necessary also to subdivide each Degree into 6. 10. or more equal parts, as the largeness of the Degree will permit; after which, prefix both to Top, Bottom, and each side the Num&rehy;bers, Corresponding to the Latitudes and <IT>Longitudes</IT>.</P>

<P>The Proportion for finding the Quan&rehy;tity of a Degree, in any Parallel, is this; <IT>As the Diameter of the Equator, is to its Circumfe&rehy;rence, so is the Diameter of the Parallel of 55 Degrees, to its Circumference</IT>; divide the Circumfe&rehy;rence of the <IT>Equator</IT> by 360. as also the Circumference of the <IT>Parallel</IT> of 55 Degrees; the first Quote is, the length of a Degree of <IT>Longitude</IT> in the <IT>Equator</IT>; the second, the <PB
N="22">length of a Degree of <IT>Longitude</IT> in the <IT>Parallel</IT> of 55 Degrees of <IT>Latitude</IT>, and therefore by so much as the first of these Quotes exceeds the second, by so much must a Degree in <IT>Latitude</IT>, exceed that of <IT>Longitude</IT>, in the making of such a <IT>Map</IT>. This brief Account, will I hope, give some light into the Method of ma&rehy;king and projecting of <IT>Maps</IT>, in the pro&rehy;secution of which, I might have been more Copious, by adding of Cuts, and making a Table of the <IT>Longitudes</IT> and <IT>Latitudes</IT> of the Boundaries of some places, and so actually transfering them into the Plan or Scheme; but when I con&rehy;sidered my design was more to shew their use, than the method of making them, I purposely omitted it. If a <IT>Map</IT> was to be made of any small Coun&rehy;ty, Hundred, Lordship, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> of about 20 or 30 Miles round, it is not so ex&rehy;actly Determined by <IT>Longitudes</IT> and <IT>La&rehy;titudes</IT>, but by an actual survey of the same with some Instrument, as Semicircle, Theodelite, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>

<P>&Iic;N most of the <IT>Circular Maps</IT>, observe, That having found the Name, you are not to take that part of the Map, pos&rehy;sest by such Name, for the true position of the place; but you are to seek either over, under, or on one side of such Name for this Mark (o) and where that stand there is the true point of that place.
</P><P>In <IT>Right Lin'd Maps</IT>, Towns and Places are generally represented by the shape of a little House, Cities with the like Mark, but something bigger.</P>
<P>When any Map is placed right before you, then take Notice, That the bot&rehy;tom part, or part next to you, general&rehy;ly is the <IT>Southern</IT> part, the top, or part farthest from you, the <IT>North</IT> part; that next your left Hand, the <IT>West</IT> part, and the other opposite, or next the right Hand, the <IT>East</IT>; which Quarters or Parts, are commonly Denoted, either by the Words, <IT>North, South, West</IT> and <IT>East</IT>, writ at Top or Bottom, and on each side, or else by a Compass, which is round like a Wheel, having 32 points issuing from the Center, which represents <PB
N="24">the 32 points of the Compass; at the end of one of them is the Picture of a <IT>Flower-de-luce</IT>, which always points ex&rehy;actly to the <IT>North</IT>.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis Evident, That you must al&rehy;ways seek for the <IT>Latitude</IT> on the sides of the <IT>Map</IT>, and the <IT>Longitude</IT> at Top and Bottom, which sometimes is diffe&rehy;rently Numbred, by reason that at the top of the Map, the <IT>Longitude</IT> may be reckoned from one place, and at the bot&rehy;tom from another.</P>
<P>Observe also in Maps of <IT>Empires</IT> and <IT>Kingdoms</IT>, the Divisions of it; in <IT>Prin&rehy;cipalities, Provinces</IT> or <IT>Counties</IT>, is gene&rehy;rally performed by a small prickt irregu&rehy;lar line.</P>
<P><IT>Rivers</IT>, is commonly Denoted by a full <IT>Black Line</IT>, and sometimes by a <IT>Dou&rehy;ble Line</IT>.</P>

<P><IT>Mountains</IT>, are represented by a <IT>Black Clouded Figure</IT>, in shape like a Bell.</P>

<PB N="25"><P>The <IT>Land</IT> is bounded from the Sea by an Irregular <IT>Dark clouded Line</IT>, which if the Map be Painted, is generally Coloured.

<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">How to find out places upon any sort of Maps.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;Here is but two Methods of find&rehy;ing out places in any Map, the one is by <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT>, and <PB
N="26">the other by <IT>Bearing</IT> and <IT>Distance</IT>, the former of which is most peculiar to cir&rehy;cular <IT>Maps</IT>, the later to right lin'd <IT>Maps</IT>; though either of the said methods may be used, for the finding of places in both kinds of <IT>Maps</IT>.
</P><P>As to the first of these, there is one grand difficulty in it, which is upon ac&rehy;count of beginning the <IT>Longitude</IT>, be&rehy;cause as I have already observed, in one Map, the <IT>Longitude</IT> begins from <IT>Gratiosa</IT>, another from St. <IT>Michael</IT>, a third from <IT>Teneriff</IT>, and a fourth from some other place; so that unless you know, from what place they reckon the <IT>Longi&rehy;tude</IT> of any Map, you can never know, by this method, how to find out any place in such Map, though the <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT> of the place be given, which indeed is a very great misfortune; For was all the <IT>Geographers</IT> but unanimously agreed from whence to begin it, that is, would they but all agree to fix it at any <CORR

<P>But however, because it is otherwise at present, I shall incert a Table, shew&rehy;ing the difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt <IT>Pico Teneriff</IT>, and most of the principal <PB

</P><P>Suppose in the Sheet-map of the World, that is, in the small Hemisphers, I would find out <IT>Jerusalem</IT>, which is in the <IT>Lon&rehy;gitude</IT> of 66.<IT>d.</IT> 00.<IT>m.</IT> counted from St. <IT>Michaels</IT>, and <IT>Latitude</IT> of 33.<IT>d.</IT> 10.<IT>m. North</IT>. Here I begin at the outer Cir&rehy;cle, which is the first <IT>Meridian</IT>, from whence the <IT>Lon&rehy;gitude</IT> is reckoned, and counted upon the Equator 66.<IT>d.</IT> its <IT>Longitude</IT>; then I reckon from the <IT>Equator</IT>, on the first <IT>Meridian</IT> upward toward the <IT>North-Pole</IT> 32.<IT>d.</IT> 10.<IT>m.</IT> the <IT>Latitude</IT>, and so tracing that Parallel till I come right against the <IT>Longitude</IT> I find this mark (o) and the word Jerusalem writ close by it, whence I Conclude, that is the true position of <IT>Jerusalem</IT>. </P>
<PB N="28"><P>And here, Note, That if in your <IT>He&rehy;misphere</IT>, the <IT>Longitude</IT> is not reckoned from St. <IT>Michaels</IT>, but some other place, then you must consider whether such place lies <IT>East</IT> or <IT>West</IT> of St. <IT>Michaels</IT>, and how many Degrees; and according&rehy;ly substract, or add, such difference from or to the given <IT>Longitude</IT> of any place, to get the <IT>Longitude</IT> of such place in that Map.
</P><P>As for Example; Suppose I look in a Map for <IT>London</IT>, whose Longitude from St. <IT>Michaels</IT> is about 27<IT>d.</IT> 30<IT>m.</IT> Now perhaps this Map begins the Longitude from the <IT>Westermost</IT> part of <IT>Spain</IT>, which is 16 Degrees <IT>East</IT> of St <IT>Michaels</IT>; here I must Substract 16 from 27.30. the Re&rehy;mainder 11.30. is the Longitude of <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT> in such Map. If the Map had be&rehy;gun his Longitude from any place that lies <IT>West</IT> of St. <IT>Michaels</IT>, as from the Isle <IT>Corvo</IT>, which is near 5<IT>d.</IT> 20<IT>m.</IT> <IT>West</IT> of St. <IT>Michaels</IT>, then to 27.30. I must have added 5 Degree 20.<IT>m.</IT> and it will give 32<IT>d.</IT> 20<IT>m.</IT> the Longitude of <IT>London</IT> in that Map, which reckons his Longitude from <IT>Corvo</IT>.</P>
<P>The second way how places may be found, is thus: Suppose I would find <PB
N="29"><IT>Bourdeaux</IT> in <IT>France</IT>, whose bearing is very near full <IT>South</IT> from <IT>London</IT>, and distance therefrom about 200 Miles; here I trace the <IT>Meridian</IT> that passes through <IT>London</IT>, which may nearly be done by the Eye or a Rule (if none be actually drawn) 200 Miles and there about you shall find the said place.</P>
<P>There is another way for finding out places upon Maps, but it is peculiar, and serves only some sort or kind, the me&rehy;thod of it is thus: The Maps are (by lines drawn Parallel to the sides thereof) divided into certain long Slips, or Spaces, about an Inch broad; which spaces is a&rehy;gain sub-divided into small Squares, by other lines drawn Parallel to the top and bottom near the same distance of the former.</P>
<P>On both sides of the Map, against each Space, is set Letters, as <IT>a, b, c, d</IT>, &amp;c. There is also both at top and bottom of the Map, other Letters set differing from the former; by help of these Letters a Table is constructed, ha&rehy;ving in it the Names of all the places, and against each Name two Letters, as (<IT>ah</IT>) or (<IT>bm</IT>) &amp;c. by which Letters I can find out any place in the Map. Thus, <PB
N="30">Suppose I seek for <IT>Babylon</IT>, in such a sort of Map, against which I find (<IT>cs</IT>) then I seek on the side of the Map for <IT>c</IT>, and at the top for <IT>s</IT>, and at the Angle of meeting, that is in the little Square, right against both these Letters, is <IT>Babylon</IT>, the place sought.</P>
<P>But in most of these sort of Maps, there generally is Directions for the u&rehy;sing of them, Printed in some vacant place of it.</P>

</P><P><IT>Secondly</IT>, If the two places have the same <IT>Longitude</IT>, and both <IT>North</IT> or <IT>South</IT> Latitude, then the difference of their <IT>Latitudes</IT> multiplied by 70, gives their distance in Miles.</P>
<PB N="31"><P><IT>Thirdly</IT>, If the two places have the same <IT>Longitude</IT>, but different <IT>Latitudes</IT>, i.e. one <IT>North</IT>, and the other <IT>South</IT>, then the sum of their <IT>Latitudes</IT> multipli&rehy;ed by 70, will give their distance in Miles.
</P><P><IT>Fourthly</IT>, If the two places have both <IT>North</IT> or <IT>South</IT> Latitude, but 180 Degrees difference of <IT>Longitude</IT>, then the sum of the complements of their Latitudes multiplied by 70, gives their distance in <IT>English</IT> Miles.</P>

<P>If the places be not in any of the Po&rehy;sitions aforesaid, but differ both in <IT>Lon&rehy;gitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT>, then having their <IT>Latitude</IT> and difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> with a Scale of versed Lines, to find their di&rehy;stance, proceed thus:</P>

Those that inhabit these parts of the Earth, are called <IT>Pe&rehy;riscians</IT>, because their shadows are thrown quite round them, they are under great inconveniencies; First, by reason of the extream Cold they suffer, and secondly, because their whole year is but one Day and Night; for when the Sun is once <PB

<PB N="27[41]"></P><P><IT>Secondly</IT>, For those who inhabit be&rehy;twixt the Equinoctical and <CORR
SIC="Topick">Tropick</CORR> of <IT>Can&rehy;cer</IT>, they have some Seasons as the for&rehy;mer, <IT>viz.</IT> two Summers and two Win&rehy;ters; for the Sun twice a Year passeth there <IT>Zenith</IT>, their Noon-shadows are likewise thrown both to the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT> part of Heaven, and sometimes directly under them, their longest day is something longer then 12 Hours.
</P><P><IT>Thirdly</IT>, The Inhabitants under the Tropick of <IT>Cancer</IT>, that is, such People that have their <IT>Zenith</IT> in the said Tro&rehy;pick, have the Sun but once a year in their <IT>Zenith</IT>, and that is when he is in the first point of <IT>Cancer</IT>, they have but one Summer and one Winter; their Noon&rehy;shadow is always toward the <IT>North</IT>, ex&rehy;cept when he is just in the Tropick, and then there is none at all, their longest day is 13<IT>h.</IT> 36<IT>m.</IT> long.</P>
<P><IT>Fourthly</IT>, The People that Inhabit be&rehy;twixt the Tropick of <IT>Cancer</IT>, and the <IT>Circle Artick</IT>, have the Sun never <IT>Verti&rehy;cal</IT>; their shadows are always thrown to&rehy;ward the <IT>North</IT>, and their Artificial Days <PB
N="42">is of all lengths, <IT>viz.</IT> from 13<IT>h.</IT> 36<IT>m.</IT> to 24 Hours.</P>
<P><IT>Fifthly</IT>, Those that have their <IT>Zenith</IT> in the <IT>Artick Circle</IT>, that is, such who live just upon that Circle, have the Pole of the Ecliptick just in their <IT>Zenith</IT>, and consequently the Ecliptick coinciding with their Horizon, and therefore the Tropick of <IT>Cancer</IT> must be all above the Horison, and the Tropick of <IT>Capricorn</IT> quite under the <IT>Horizon</IT>, so that the Sun being in the first point of <IT>Cancer</IT>, their artificial Day is just 24 hours long, and their Night but a Moment, their sha&rehy;dow is cast quite round them.</P>
<P><IT>Sixthly</IT>, The People inhabiting be&rehy;twixt the <IT>North-pole</IT>, and <IT>Artick Circle</IT>, have their Horizon cutting the Ecliptick in two points, and a certain portion of it equally distant from the first point of <IT>Cancer</IT> that never sets, but remains al&rehy;ways above the Horizon; whence it cometh to pass, that all the time the Sun is passing this portion of the Eclip&rehy;tick, they have continual Day and no Night, the length of which is more or less, according to the pportion of the E<PB
N="43">cliptick that never sets, being about one Month long when the said portion is 30 Degrees, two Months when the said portion is 60 Degrees, or two Signs, and so on: That is, the farther <IT>North</IT>, the longer day, till at last you come just under the Pole it self, where the whole Year is but one Day and Night, each being half a Year: In this Position also, there is a certain portion of the Ecliptick, equidistant from the first point of <IT>Capri&rehy;corn</IT>, that never Rises or comes above the Horizon, so that during the time the Sun is passing the said Portion, there is perpetual Night to these Inhabitants, their shadows are also projected quite round them.</P>
<P><IT>Seventhly</IT>, As for those people (if a&rehy;ny be) inhabiting just under the Pole, they have the Equinoctial coinciding with their Horizon, and have always but the <IT>Northern</IT> half of the Ecliptick a&rehy;bove the Horizon, so that their Year is but one natural Day as before was hin&rehy;ted; for when the Sun passeth the first point of <IT>Aries</IT>, then to those People he arises, and sets not again till he passes the first point of <IT>Libra</IT>, which is half a Year <PB
N="26[44]">after, they never see no more then half the Heavens at once, all the <IT>Southern</IT> Hemisphere being totally obscured from their sight; their shadow is likewise cast clear round them, the end of it projecting a <IT>Concentrick Circle</IT>.</P>
