<HEAD><RO>The PREFACE</RO>.</HEAD>
<P>&Hic;Ow dear the glory of God and the Kingdome of Christ should be unto all, and is to every one in whom dwelleth the love of God, is on all hands acknowledged; That it is a duty incumbent upon all men, not onely to praise God with their lips, but also to honour God with their substance, and that in a proportionable manner to what the Lord hath been pleased to betrust them with; we wish it were as cheerfully practised as it will be readily grant&rehy;ed. As there is no greater honour that can be put upon a Creature, than to be in a capacity of honouring God, especi&rehy;ally when to this is added the blessing of a large and wise heart to understand how great a trust that is, and what a glorious advantage is put into his hands; So there is no great&rehy;er Evidence of a sincere heart than to be unwilling to offer to the Lord such Sacrifice as cost nothing: And as it is a duty to honour God, so it is a duty also to study in what wayes God may be honoured, and if one way be more conducing than another to the attainment of that great end, that way is most eligible, by wise and pious Christians; And although it is a lauda&rehy;ble and necessary work to exercise Charity towards the bodies of distressed persons, yet those must needs be the most noble acts of Charity which concern the souls of men, seeing both the object of them is more excellent, and the effects more dura&rehy;ble. And as the means instituted by Christ for the good of souls, is the erection and maintenance of his Church, and the supplying of it with an able and pious Ministry: So it hath been in all ages the care of those whose hearts have been touched with a sence of Gods honour, and a fervent desire of <PB
N="[ii]">the Churches enlargement, to afford such liberal supplies and encouragements as might both prepare men for, and support them in the work of the Ministry. And these are the ends which have been principally aimed at by all, but all have not used the same means to those ends, nor are all means equally effectual: It is therefore our desire in this Model to make choice of such wayes as to us seeme most useful for the fore&rehy;mentioned purposes: And because the foundation of the work lies in the excellencie of the natural parts of such as are de&rehy;signed that way, a few such being more worth than a farre greater proportion of other men; it is therefore of great use, and we shall endeavour that it may be our great care to single out such persons to whom God hath given the most high and promising abilities: Who if they be placed under the most learned and godly Tutors we can finde, and obliged as far as possibly we can to a diligent and eminent improvement in knowledge of all sorts and solid piety, we conceive it will be no arrogance humbly to expect a more than ordinary advan&rehy;tage to the poor Church, which now, if ever, calls for Teachers of exquisite abilities: And because there are some Church&rehy;works of great concernment which cannot be conveniently managed by such as are overwhelmed with preaching work (such as the resolution of weighty doubts and cases of consci&rehy;ence, the stopping of the mouths of gain-sayers and the like) it must be judged of great advantage to have some particu&rehy;lar persons exquisitely fit for such works both in regard of na&rehy;tural and acquired endowments, who should be set apart for such works to attend upon them without distraction. The ra&rehy;ther, because there are diverse men, peradventure not emi&rehy;nent for preaching gifts, who being wisely improved, may be very serviceable to other of the Churches necessities: And these are the chief intendments of the following Model: Yet, for as much as there may be diverse towardly youths, of competent parts (though short of the eminencie that some others attaine to) and meane condition, who may be of good use in the Mi<PB
N="[iii]">nisterial work, and seeing the ordinary necessities of the Church are not to be neglected, especially the condition of <RO>Ireland</RO> and <RO>Wales</RO>, and some dark parts of <RO>England</RO> being so dolefull and dismal, we hope it will be an acceptable work to lay in provision in this Model, whereby fit persons may be sent into those places, which by reason of their distance many cannot, and others do not go into: We confesse, as we shall not be wanting in our prayers and endeavours, as far as God shall enable us sincerely and impartially to look to these ends and wayes propounded; so we cannot but hope in God that the bowels of many precious souls will be refreshed by these means. And we are confident whoever shall engage their hearts in this free-will-offering to God, will have no cause to repent of it, nor shall it be a grief of heart to any at the last day (when the rust of other mens silver shall rise up against them to their everlasting confusion) to have been the happy instru&rehy;ments of enlarging the Church, and propagating the Gospel, and saving of souls; and in this life also the generations to come shall call them blessed.

&horbar;
<P>SECT. 1.</P>
<P>&Tic;Hat a Subscription be made by such whose hearts are affected with Gods Glory, and the Churches good in the advancement of learning and piety.
</P><P><IT>Sect.</IT> 2. And because subscriptions of this nature, though happily begun, have heretofore failed, lest it should happen so in this case (whereby the whole designe would be frustrated, and Youths of excellent parts hopefully planted at the University forced to remove, besides many other inconveniences) we do earnestly desire that God would stirre up the hearts of those whose estates will bear it, to subscribe for eight yeares or more, or for ever. Which we shall look on as a Noble and Eminent act of Charity, and which present and future ages may have cause to blesse God for, and as the most proper and onely certain course to promote the intended designe, and to prevent the forementioned mischiefs, yet if any shall contribute any thing upon other termes, we judge it a very acceptable service, and we hope it will occasion thanks&rehy;giving to God on their behalf.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 3. That the money collected, be disposed of by per&rehy;sons chosen to be Trustees not exceeding the number of fifty, whereof thirty to be Gentlemen or Citizens of Eminency, and twenty to be Ministers in or within five miles of the City of <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT>; of which number any 7, to be a <IT>Quorum</IT>, whereof three to be <PB
N="2">Ministers. And that these Trustees do solemnly engage them&rehy;selves to proceed in all things without partiality, as they shall judge best for the publick good, and not to be byassed by any fa&rehy;vours or recommendations or respects whatsoever.</P>
<P>And that when any Minister who is a Trustee dieth, or refu&rehy;seth to act further in the businesse, or removeth ten miles from the City of <IT>London</IT>, or by the rest of the Trustees is judged to deserve dismission from this Trust, the rest of the Trustees, or any nine of them, (notice being given to the generality of the Trustees of the meeting, and of the end of it) being met together, proceed to choose another. And that they solemn&rehy;ly engage themselves to choose one whom for piety, discretion, learning, fidelity, activity, publick spiritednesse, ingenuity, and other necessary qualifications, they judge fit for the work. And that when any other of the Trustees, to wit, Gentlemen, or Citizens die or refuse to act further, or are by the rest judged unfit to continue in this Trust; the rest of the Trustees or any nine of them, (notice being generally given to the Trustees of the meeting, and of the end of it) being met together, proceed to choose another, and that they choose one of con&rehy;siderable quality, wisdome, known integrity, and affections to the advancement of Religion and Learning.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 4. That the Trustees do choose a Treasurer (being a person of unquestionable fidelity) from year to year upon the twenty first day of <IT>March</IT>, to begin to exercise his Trust <IT>March</IT> the twenty fifth following, who shall be accountable to the Trustees once a Quarter, or to any seven or more of them; And that the Treasurers discharge be sufficient to any that shall pay the money. And that the Treasurer shall not dispose of any of the money, but according to the direction of the said Trustees, or any seven of them, (whereof three to be Ministers) met together for that purpose, (notice being generally given of such a meeting;) to be expressed in writing in a book to be kept for that use by one of the Trustees appointed by the rest.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 5. That the Trustees, or any five of them, (whereof three to be Ministers) appointed by the rest or any nine of the rest met together, notice still being generally given to the Trustees of the meeting, shall go about to Schooles in or within twen&rehy;ty miles of the City of <IT>London</IT>, or thereabouts; and shall con<PB
N="3">ferre with the Schoole-Masters, and out of six of the most inge&rehy;nious Boyes being strictly examined, two of the best be chosen. And so to go from one Schoole to another. And because we would not have the benefit of this work confin'd to <IT>London</IT>, and the adjacent parts: But as we hope for help from diverse persons in the several Counties, and as for the future any County is ca&rehy;pable of enjoying such Ministers as through Gods blessing shall be sent forth by the care of the Trustees, so for the present we would have ingenious boyes of any County to be capable of it, and therefore if any lad of rare parts from any place be recom&rehy;mended and found to be such, that care be taken to maintain him and instruct him more perfectly in some eminent Schoole where the Trustees think fit, and so send him to the University: or that for this present time (but no more) the Students be pick&rehy;ed out of the most ingenious Scholars of the first or second year that now are at the University, six out of twelve: and that more respect be had to their parts, than learning, seeing learning may be added. And that for such as shall be chosen, if they have any parents, or such friends as have a power to dispose of them, both the students and their parents, or such friends shall promise in writing that they will submit to the Trustees for the education of such students, both as to the man&rehy;ner of it and the time, as both are expressed in this Model.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 6. That the boyes to be chosen be, as of eminent parts, so of an ingenuous disposition, not enemies to godlinesse, nor such as have a sufficient maintenance any other way. That they be the children of such parents as are, 1. not Scoffers at godlinesse, 2. Nor men of corrupt principles as to the weighty poynts of Religion. 3. Such as are poor, or but in a mean condition: Yet if a boy be towardly and pious, his parents corruption shall be no prejudice to him, but godlinesse wherever it is shall be in a special manner considered.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 7. That the boyes so chosen be sent to the University, and be there placed under such Tutours as the Trustees shall choose, (who shall be men as near, as may be eminent both for godlinesse and learning, and care of their Pupils) which Tutours shall have for their encouragement four pounds a year for tuition for each of these students, that there they have ten or fifteen or twenty <PB
N="4">pounds a year allowed them, as the Trustees shall think fit, till they be Batchelars, and if need require, and the Trustees see fit, that they be considered for their degree, (as also afterwards for their Master of Arts degree) and after they are Batchelars; (if they have been very diligent, &amp;c.) twenty or thirty pounds a year, as the Trustees think fit. And that they shall be ob&rehy;liged to study to be eminent in the Latine, Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental <CORR
SIC="lauguages">languages</CORR>, and in the several Arts and Sci&rehy;ences, still reserving a power to the Trustees to consider the diffe&rehy;rences of the parts or dispositions of lads, and accordingly to ac&rehy;commodate them as they see cause. And that over and besides their ordinary Universities exercises, they be tied to special ex&rehy;ercises in those things as shall be thought fit by the Trustees, and such learned men in the University, as they shall advise with, as the making of Speeches, Verses, Epistles, &amp;c in the languages, holding disputations and making Lectures in the Mathematick, Civil Law, &amp;c.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 8. That they have their allowance continued for eight yeares, and that they intend and direct their studies to&rehy;wards the Ministry, and if contributions come in sufficiently a&rehy;bove what shal suffice for the yearly maintenance of twenty Scho&rehy;lars at the University in order to the Ministry, some more eminently able be pick't out of the rest, (whose inclinations are rather to continue at the University, and who are fitter for it) who shall be allowed to take fellowships if it shall please any Colledge to bestow them upon them, and also have such allowance, as the Trustees shall judge fit, (according to the excellency of their parts and learning, and the nature of their work, and their ha&rehy;ving, or wanting other maintenance,) upon these conditions. 1. That they be obliged to take no Pupils, if they are Fellowes, but by the consent of the Trustees till they are Masters of Arts, and then not too many. 2. That as every ones <IT>genius</IT> leads him, and as he is judged fit, so he principally prosecute some one kind of study, one to be the Linguist and principally for Greek, and for Jewish and Rabinical learning, another the Historian, and Antiquary, another the Philosopher and Mathematician, another the Polemical Divine, one or more another the Practical and Casu&rehy;istical Divine, another the Universalist. 3. That each of those em<PB
N="5">ploy themselves (when occasion shall require, and the Trustees shall reasonably desire) in such works as shall be useful and ne&rehy;cessary. And if there be a sufficiency of contribution above what shall suffice for those before mentioned ends, the rest be employed as the Trustees shall think fit (provided alwayes it be imployed for the apparent advancement of learning and piety) and, whereas diverse after they have been four years at the University, are forced through poverty to go away, ere they commence Batchelars, or presently after, and to enter into the Ministry while they are raw, that a special regard be had to such, as du&rehy;ring that four years have most approved themselves, and are most eminent both for learning and godlinesse, that they have an al&rehy;lowance for their degree, and also to support them at the Uni&rehy;versity three or four yeares more, (provided it be bestowed upon such Batchelars, as do truly intend to enter into the Ministry.)</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 9. That once in a year the Trustees, or any five of them appointed by the rest, whereof three to be Ministers, go to the University, and there (with the help of some able U&rehy;niversity men) finde out their profiting, that if any excell the rest, &amp;c. the Trustees shall give them such encouragement as they shall see fit, and that if there be conscience-satisfying evi&rehy;dence of the idlenesse or dissolutenesse, or any depravednesse of any of them, the Trustees, either then, or at any other time after admonition and tryal for so long time as they shall think fit, may withdraw the exhibition from them, & chuse others in their place.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 10. That once in a year there be two or three picked out of the Students, by the Trustees, to come up to <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT> (their charges being born) to do some learned exercises in the City, if the Trustees think fit, and as they think fit; that so the Contributers may see some fruit of their cost, and others may be excited and encouraged.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 11. That there be an accurate Method of studies pre&rehy;scribed for them (with some Latitude for the variety of their <IT>geni&rehy;us's</IT>) that so no time may be lost that way.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 12. That their Tutours be desired to have a special eye upon them, as to their godlinesse, and to presse them to a dili&rehy;gent attendance upon all means publick and private conducing thereunto.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 13. That after eight years well spent there, the Trustees <PB
N="6">and Contributers do by themselves and friends endeavour to promote them to a place answerable to their merit.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 14. That the addition or alteration of Circumstances be left to the wisdome of the Trustees, or any nine, or more of them, whereof foure to be Ministers, provided that notice be given to the Trustees generally of the meeting, and of the end for which the meeting is appointed, and provided alwayes that the substantials remain untouched, (to wit,) the bringing up of eminent Scholars at the University, in order to the Ministry, and (if contributions come in sufficiently) the leaving of o&rehy;thers at the University according to the eighth Article.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 15. That there be two or three chosen out of the Univer&rehy;sity, who shall be intreated to take some inspection over them.</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 16. That those of the Trustees that shall be chosen by the rest for any of the publick work, shall have their charges born them. And that all charges incidental to the work in the management of it, shall be allowed out of the Stock.</P>
<P>&sect;. 17. And although our great aim in this businesse is the bringing up of Scholars of eminent parts and learning, & the supplying of the Church with choice Ministers, and such as through Gods blessing may be pillars of the Church, yet because the or&rehy;dinary necessities of the Church are also to be provided for, es&rehy;pecially seeing the deplorable condition of <IT>Ireland</IT> and <IT>Wales</IT>, and some desolate parts of <IT>England</IT>, cries loud for our assistance, the Trustees therefore (after provision made for the foremen&rehy;tioned branches of the designe) shall endeavour to take care a&rehy;bout the maintenance of poor Scholars of competent abilities and good inclinations (though it may be not of eminent parts) at the University and shall allow them what they see fit.</P>
<P>And such lads as also their parents or such friends as have the dispose of them, before they be admitted, shall in writing engage themselves to be willing to be disposed of by the Trustees, and to be sent into <IT>Ireland</IT>, or <IT>Wales</IT>, or some destitute parts of <IT>England</IT>,) as the exigencies of the Church require) Provided alwayes that they shall not be sent to any such places, unlesse there be competent encouragement for them (of which the Trustees shall be judges.)</P>
<P><IT>Sect.</IT> 18. For our Brethren in any Counties who shall be pleas<PB
N="7">ed to contribute to this work, we desire that to their former fa&rehy;vour they would adde this, to take some care for the payment of their monies in <IT>London</IT> quarterly, and either to appoint some person in <IT>London</IT> from whom it may be expected quarterly, or else to send it in to the Treasurer.</P>

<TEXT><BODY><P REND="it">Here followeth a Testimonial from some reverend Do&rehy;ctours, who are Heads of houses at <RO>Cambridge</RO>, the reason why here is not a Testimony from <RO>Oxford</RO>, is not out of any foolish &aelig;mulation or neglect of that other Renowned U&rehy;niversity, but only because he that negotiated the businesse was principally acquainted with the Heads of the other University.
</P><P>&Wic;E whose Names are here under written, having perused certain Articles or Proposals communicated unto us, containing a design for the collecting of a yearly summe of mo&rehy;nies, to be disposed of by Trustees for the breeding up of Stu&rehy;dents in the University in order to the Ministry, We do in our private judgments very much approve thereof, as that which, being faithfully and duly executed, may through Gods blessing be very much conducing to the advancement of learning, the defending of the truth, and building up of the Church of Christ, and now especially needful, when the work is so great, and the number of faithful labourers so small, and in danger to be smaller through the inability of some, and the unwillingnesse of others to breed up their children in such a way. And it will be matter of our rejoycing and thanksgiving unto God to behold others also in the several parts of this Nation, induced by this example of the great City, to designe their superfluities to so charitable, so Christian, and so seasonable a work.

<SALUTE><IT>Gentlemen</IT>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic; Have here a happy opportunity to offer you an excellent benefit, by inviting you to an excellent duty. If receiving be unpleasant to you, how came you to be rich? If you like it, come while the Market lasts. Come before Thieves, or fire, or Souldiers have seized upon your perishing wealth, come be&rehy;fore death hath taken you from all. You see here that Christ is contented to be your Debtour, at the usury of a hundred for one, in this world, and in the world to come, eternal life. <IT>Matthew</IT> 19.29. If you are covetous, take this bargain, for all the world cannot help you to the like for your Commodity: If you are <IT>not covetous</IT>, you will not be tenacious of your money: The offer is so fair, and so unmatchable, that I know not what can keep you from accepting it, unlesse it be that you dare not trust the Word, the Promise, the Covenant of Christ. And whom then will you trust? who shall keep your wealth? will you? But who shall keep you then? will you undertake to keep your selves? Alas, how long? Is God to be trusted with the susten&rehy;tation of the whole Creation, and the government of all the world, and with the lives of you and all the living, and with the prospering of your labours, and your daily preservation and provision? and yet is he not to be trusted with your money? you'le say you trust God? let us see now that you do not play the hypocrites? If you are friends to Christ, you may see in the work here offered to you, your Masters Name, and interest and honour! It's certainly his voice that calls you to this adventure and therefore never make question of your call. If you are friends to your Country, now let it be seen: If you live an hund&rehy;red years, perhaps you will never have a better opportunity to shew it. If you are Protestants and love the Gospel, shew it <PB
N="9">by helping to plant and water the Seminaries of the Lord. Per&rehy;haps you cannot dispute for the Truth, or preach for it your selves: But you can contribute for the maintenance of some to do it: This then is your work, know it and performe it. You may have a Prophets reward, without being your selves Prophets. <IT>Matthew</IT> 10.41. At least therefore, shew that you love your selves, and that you love your money better than to lose it, by casting it away upon the flesh, and leaving it in the world behind you. If you can stay here alwayes with it, then keep it: I speak to none but those that must die, and me&rehy;thinks such should be glad to learn the art of sending their wealth to meet them in another world. If you understand not that giving is receiving, and the giver is more beholden, than the beggar, and that it is for your selves that God com&rehy;mandeth you to give, and that the more you thus lose, the more you save and gain, you are then unacquainted with the reasons of Christianity, and the life of faith. I hope your are sensible of <IT>Englands</IT> priviledges, above the dark Mahometans or Indi&rehy;ans, in the freedome of Ordinances, and plenty of receiving opportunities. And know you not that an opportunity of giving may be as great a mercy to you, as of hearing or praying, and should be as forwardly and thankfully accepted. He was never acquainted with the Christian life of doing good, that findes it not the most sweet and pleasant life. Though we must snatch no unsound consolation from our works, but detest the thoughts of making God beholden to us; yet we must walk in them as his way. <IT>Ephes.</IT> 2.10, in which we are likeliest to meet him: he is likest to God, that doth most good, and that would do most. That is such an improvement of time and stock, that you may omit a prayer, a Sermon, or a Sacrament for it, rather than omit it: you may violate the rest of a Sabbath to shew mercy, <IT>Mat.</IT> 12.4.5. Your Lord and Master with a special remark, hath set you all this lesson for to study. <IT>Mat.</IT> 9.13. [<q rend=it>But go ye and learn, what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacri&rehy;fice</q>] And yet such is here the happy combination, that it is mercy and sacrifice, because it is mercy for sacrifice, that you are called to. And doubt not but <q rend=it>with such sacrifice God is well pleased</q>, Heb. 13.16. <q rend=it>Forget not <ro>therefore</ro> to communicate and do good. It is more blessed to give, than to receive</q><bibl>, Acts 20.35.</bibl> <PB
N="10">For the nature of the work before you, consider, First, Is it not pity that so good a breed of wits as <IT>England</IT> is renowned for, should be starved for want of culture and encouragement. Se&rehy;condly, Is it not pity that so many thousands of soules should starve in ignorance, or be poysoned by seducements, for want of cost to procure a remedy. And what abundance that may be saved by the Ministry of such as you maintain, may blesse God for you as the helpers of their salvation. 3. The necessi&rehy;ties of the Church have of late called Students so young into the Ministry, that eminent Proficients in Languages, Sciences, An&rehy;tiquities, &amp;c, grow thin, and are in danger of being worn out, if there be not some extraordinary helps for chosen wits addicted to these studies. And what a dishonour, what a losse that would be to us, the Papists would quickly understand. 4. The bar&rehy;barous face of the Greek and other Eastern Churches tells us, what need there is of learned instruments, for the maintenance and propagation of the Truth. Fifthly, What abundance of Colledges and Monasteries can the Romanists maintain, to fill the World with Missionaries of all sorts, which is the very strength of their Kingdome. And is it not pity that a better work should be starved through our want of pious charity: and that Papists should dare us, and we be unfurnished with Cham&rehy;pions to resist them, when we are furnished with so much evi&rehy;dence of truth, which yet may easily be lost by ill managing! Sixthly, If you are the servants of Christ, above all you must now look about you for his Church and Ministry. For the Di&rehy;vel hath given you so strong an Allarme, that he that now sits still, and runs not to his Armes, to help the Church, is a Tray&rehy;tor, and no true Souldier of Christ. Papists are up, and Atheists and Infidels and Jewes are up, and abundance of secret Apostates are up openly reproaching the Ministry, that privately deride Christ and Scripture, and the life to come, (I know what I say to be too true) Quakers are up, and all the prophane as farre as they dare: And shall not we be up to further that Gospel and Ministry and Church of Christ, which so many bands of the Prince of darknesse, are armed to assault. Let us discourage the Devil; by making an advantage of his assaults. Let him see that we never do so much for Christ and the Church, as when he as&rehy;saulteth them with the fiercest or cunningest <UNCLEAR>malignity</UNCLEAR>. He that <PB
N="11">hath not so publick a spirit, as to value the well-fare of the Church and the soules of men, before the fulnesse of his own e&rehy;state, may go away sorrowful from Christ (as <IT>Luke</IT> 18.23,24.) but a true Disciple he cannot be. It would make a mans heart ake to think of the dark state of the world, for want of Preachers. Were it but the state of <IT>Ireland</IT> and <IT>Wales</IT>, it should move us to compassion. And now I offer it to your sober thoughts, as to men that are going to be accountable for their Talents, whether you have a better way to dispose of your money, and a way that will be more comfortable to you at death and judgment. I would not have you unmerciful to your children: but if you think you may not lawfully alienate any of your estates from them, you are farre from the minde of the primitive Christians, that sold all and laid it at the Apostles feet. If you ask, why we leave you not to your selves to be charitable where you see cause, I answer, First, there is so much difficulty in every good work, even in giving so as to make the best of it, that you should be thankful to those that will help to facilitate it. Secondly, Great works must have many hands. Thirdly, Conjunction engageth and encourageth, and drawes on those in the company, that else would lagge behind. What need we else associate for our Mini&rehy;sterial works of instruction, Discipline, &amp;c and leave not every Minister to himself: In company we go more chearfully, easily, regularly and prevalently. And should you not associate also in your duties.
</P><P>Well Gentlemen, seeing it is undoubted that the work before you, is of great importance to the honour of Christ, to the well&rehy;fare of the Church, to the Protestant Religion, to the soules of thousands, and to your own everlasting benefit, take heed how you refuse to do your best, lest God distrain on you before you are aware and then hold it or your soules if you can. And say not but you were warned by a friend that would have had you have saved your money and your soules, by making the best of your Masters stock. And if what I have said do not perswade you, I intreat you to read a Preface to a Book that I have writ&rehy;ten to this purpose, called, <IT>The crucifying of the world, &amp;c.</IT> Read <IT>Gal.</IT> 6.6,7,8,9,10. Accept this invitation to so good a work, from </P>

<HEAD>A word to the Rich, that desire to give up their account with comfort.</HEAD>
<P>&Sic;Uffer I beseech you one word of exhortation, and with at&rehy;tention read a few lines which may be of everlasting con&rehy;cernment to you. I will suppose I speak not to <IT>Atheists</IT>, but to such as are possest with a belief of an eternal estate of infinite happinesse or misery: not to fooles, but to wise men who would not wilfully neglect any thing, which is necessary to secure them from the wrath to come. It is also notoriously known, that the wilful continuance in the neglect of any one evident duty, or the commission of any manifest sin is sufficient to en&rehy;title a man to damnation, notwithstanding any professions of Religion or practises whatsoever: You cannot but know that many perish eternally, not for any grosse wickednesse visible to the world, but for slie and secret and unobserved omission sins, and that these are the onely sins which our Saviour formes a pro&rehy;cesse against in that famous repr&aelig;sentation of the last judgment. <IT>Mat.</IT> 25. And amongst those duties which men are most prone to neglect, are those which are difficult and costly and trouble&rehy;some, which made Christ pronounce it so hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven: And therefore you that are rich had need double your diligence to make your calling and election sure. And truly it is an unspeakable happinesse (if the Lord give you hearts to consider it) that your riches wisely managed, may afford you a special and eminent evidence and assurance of Gods love, and your own future happinesse; forasmuch as if you freely lay out those riches that God hath gra&rehy;ciously given you, for his glory and the Churches good, it may be a notable and sound discovery of a lively faith, (which can part with present comforts in hopes of those future and unseen consolations) a fervent love to God and the brethren, a reso&rehy;lution to part with all for Christ, and a serious and true desire of salvation: As on the other side it is a token of perdition, when a mans heart is glued to his riches, and the present evil world, when a man is so destitute of charity, that rather than part with his riches, he will suffer, bodies and soules to perish; and the <PB
N="13">glory of God to be turned into shame: I beseech you therefore by the bowels of God have compassion upon your immortal soules, make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteousnesse, throw not your selves over-board to preserve your riches, from which you can expect no other requital, but this, that the rust of them shall rise up in judgment against you at the last day: and this duty I may the more boldly exhort you to, because, if you make use of your reason, you will finde the performance of it is no way disadvantageous to you: for, as you will gain this excel&rehy;lent advantage, besides eternal salvation, that, that portion of your estates which you lay out for God, will be a means to sweet&rehy;en and secure all the rest to you and your posterity, so, by the doing of it you will lose nothing of substance, seeing that is most true and evident by daily experience which our Saviour saith; That the comfort of a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of what he possesseth. For what are riches, but for use, with&rehy;out which a mans chest hath as much good by his riches as he; and how can a man use them, but for his pleasure or credit, or posterity, or the like? and who knowes not that many discreet men of competent estates between want and affluence enjoy more real pleasure in their estates, than they that have ten times a larger portion? and if a man look to his credit, let any impar&rehy;tial man judge, whether it more advanceth a mans reputation, sordidly to hoard up his riches to the dishonour of Religion, his own shame and contempt (whereby he lives lamented, and dies desired) or generously to lay them out in such wayes as not only procure him favour with God, but respect from men here, and at last a Crown of glory that fades not away? and if a man aims at posterity, methinks this City hath afforded sufficient experi&rehy;ments to convince any ingenuous man, that the leaving of vast estates to children, doth commonly betray them not onely to the greatest wickednesses, but also to manifold miseries, which they that carry their sales lower, and whose estates are nearer the golden Mediocrity are preserved from: I may adde to all this that diverse of you in this City may say with <IT>Jacob</IT>, with my staffe I came over <IT>Jordan</IT>, and now God hath made me two hands. That God that hath brought down others, hath exalted you, that God that hath impoverished others, hath enriched you, and therefore, if others owe their thousands to God, surely you owe your ten thousands. Remember I beseech you, that hand <PB
N="14">that gave you your estates, can recall them when he pleaseth, and if you deny him the interest, he can revoke the principal. Re&rehy;member you will not alwayes have such opportunities: Ere long you and the poorest wretch must be upon the same termes, now you have an advantage over them, and a means to do God more special service: I shall trouble you no further, but only this, lay out your estates, but do it freely, not <CORR
SIC="grudgginly">grudgingly</CORR>, do it liberally, not sparingly: I shall not here determine that Que&rehy;stion, whether God expects a tenth part of your estates to be im&rehy;ployed in his service and for publick good. But thus much I may safely say, that where God sowes liberally, he expects to reap liberally. And as Gods Ministration to us under the Gos&rehy;pel doth exceed the legal Ministration, so I know no reason why our Ministration to God from our superfluities should not ex&rehy;ceed theirs under the Law: And however men can easily deceive themselves here in things which concern their profit, yet I doubt not when men shall at last come to make a review of all their actions, their consciences will justly condemne them, not only for the total neglect of such duties, but also for the not doing of them in a fit and full proportion: For this particular occasion, I shall say nothing more than what is said in the Preface, and in these other annexed Papers: Consider what hath been said, and remember it comes from one whose design is not his own profit, (nor to lay a yoke upon you which he will not take up&rehy;on his own shoulders) but meerly that God may be glorified, and that, at that last day, fruit may abound to your account.
