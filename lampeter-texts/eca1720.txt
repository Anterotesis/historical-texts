<HEAD>A <BO>LETTER</BO> TO A <BO>Member of Parliament</BO>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HE Miscarriage of the Naval Store&rehy;Bill last Session of Parliament, lead&rehy;ing several Gentlemen to enquire how a Bill so very advantageous to the Publick, could be lost; and your Desire of having the true Reasons which put the Merchants upon applying for it, have en&rehy;gag'd me to give you the Trouble of this Let&rehy;ter: in which you have, according to the best of my Knowledge, the true Cause for undertak&rehy;ing it, and also my Thoughts touching the regu&rehy;lating our Trade to the Plantations, in those Par&rehy;ticulars you seem to be dissatisfy'd in.
</P><P>It is well known that we formerly receiv'd our Supply of Pitch and Tar from <IT>Sweden</IT>: but the <PB
N="4"><IT>Swedish</IT> Merchants knowing that the Best Tarand Pitch was made in their Country, thought they had an Opportunity given them to engross it to themselves, and to send it out in their own Ship&rehy;ping, and sell it to their Neighbours at their own Prices: In order thereunto, they form'd a Tar&rehy;Company, who engross'd the whole; and several severe Laws were made, that no Makers should sell to any but to them, and that no Ships, either fo&rehy;reign or their own, should load any but for their Account, and by their Order.</P>
<P>This Monopoly gave great Uneasiness to our Merchants, who thought it a Hardship to be de&rehy;barr'd bringing home what Pitch and Tar they had occasion for their own Shipping; for losing that Navigation was putting a Number of Ships out of Employment, and consequently pay&rehy;ing our Neighbours for Work whilst our People were unimploy'd.</P>
<P>They made several Complaints, but to no pur&rehy;pose, till the Year 1703. a War being then de&rehy;clar'd with <IT>France</IT>, and consequently a Royal Navy to be fitted out.</P>
<P>Upon Examination it was found, that there was not then Pitch and Tar enough in <IT>London</IT> for an immediate Supply.</P>
<P>Hereupon several Letters were wrote to Dr. <IT>Robinson</IT>, now Bishop of <IT>London</IT>, then her Maje&rehy;sty's Envoy at the Court of <IT>Sweden</IT>, upon that Occasion: To which the Doctor return'd an An&rehy;swer from <IT>Warsaw</IT>, the 4th of <IT>August</IT>, 1703. to Sir <IT>Charles Hedges</IT> Secretary of State. This Let&rehy;ter was copy'd out, and given to several Mer&rehy;chants, that they might see how much it was in the Power of the King of <IT>Sweden</IT>, either to for&rehy;ward the fitting out the Royal Navy of <IT>England</IT>, or to keep it in Harbour.</P>
<PB N="5"><P>But for better Information, I have transcrib'd the Letter, <IT>viz.</IT>
</P><QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><SALUTE>"<IT>SIR</IT>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic; Just now receiv'd your Honour's Letter of <IT>July</IT> the 6th, with Orders that I should earnestly press the King of <IT>Sweden</IT> to give such Directions about the Delivery of Pitch and Tar, as that her Majesty may know what she has to trust to therein.</P>
<P>Upon this Subject I humbly take leave to re&rehy;peat what I have formerly writ your Honour, that on the 17/27th of <IT>March</IT> last I transmitted to the King of <IT>Sweden</IT> her Majesty's Letter about this Business, and sent it with a large Deduc&rehy;tion to Count <IT>Piper</IT>; whereupon on the 20th of <IT>March</IT> his Majesty writ to the College of Commerce at <IT>Stockholm</IT>, that they should give all due Assistance to the <IT>English</IT> Factors, em&rehy;ploy'd to buy up that Commodity for her Maje&rehy;sty's Service; that for ready Money they should be supply'd as well with what was wanting for the two former Years, as what was desir'd for this. Which Letter I sent to <IT>Stockholm</IT>, where it was in due time receiv'd.</P>
<P>Not long after, Count <IT>Piper</IT> told me, the Di&rehy;rectors of the Tar-Trade had represented it to the King as a great Grievance, that they should be oblig'd to deliver at <IT>Stockholm</IT> any Pitch or Tar for the Use of the <IT>English</IT> Navy, for that they could to much more Advantage carry it thither, and sell it themselves.</P>
<P>I prest the Count very earnestly, that at least the King's Letter, which was already sent, might be comply'd with for this Year; and that if the like was desir'd for the future, we should give them Time for Deliberation, whether they thought fit to gratify the Queen therein or not.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>I had hopes this fair Request would not have met with any Difficulty, but have lately heard from Mr. <IT>Jackson</IT> it has been wholly rejected, and that the Directors of the Tar-Trade have declared they will export to <IT>England</IT> and else&rehy;where all their Pitch and Tar for their own ac&rehy;counts, and that her Majesty's Navy shall be sup&rehy;plied at the Market-Price fixed. This I take to be all her Majesty has to trust to on that side; and my humble Opinion is, no Relief from hence can much mend the matter.
</P><P>For as it can hardly be expected any new Or&rehy;der from the King of <IT>Sweden</IT> (if procured, which is uncertain) can arrive at <IT>Stockholm</IT> till some time in <IT>September</IT>, so it is not sure it will then be obey'd more than hitherto, especially consi&rehy;dering that by that time the Transportation of Pitch and Tar from <IT>Finland</IT> to <IT>Stockholm</IT> will be almost over, and the Directors will have to say, that they have not the Quantity desired.</P>
<P>It would also fall into a hazardous Winter&rehy;Voyage, and, in all human appearance, not an&rehy;swer her Majesty's Occasions; wherefore I am much in pain what Resolutions to take.</P>
<P>To repeat her Majesty's Request to no purpose, and where there may be a tolerable Pretence for not complying with it, seems to me to be very improper; and I humbly hope your Honour will be of that mind.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>Jackson</IT> writes me in his Letter of <IT>July</IT> 1, that a good Sum was then offer'd to facilitate the Matter, but he had no hope it would succeed; I also believe it will not, the Count <IT>Wrede</IT> being so little inclined to contribute in any case to a good Intelligence between <IT>England</IT> and <IT>Sweden</IT>, and none else having any Authority in these Matters: and therefore if these Endeavours also fail, I cannot perceive her Majesty can with any <PB
N="7">Certainty be supplied otherwise than either by buying Pitch and Tar of those Directors, at such a Price as they will sell it at in <IT>England</IT>, or by seizing what they send, whether found by Sea or in Port, and taking it at a reasonable Price.</P>
<P>The King of <IT>Sweden</IT> did the same last Year by Lead bound for <IT>Dantzick</IT>; and our Merchants there writ me, they apprehend it may be so this Year also.</P>
<P>The Reclaimers, not insisting upon the Ad&rehy;vantage they might have had by carrying their Lead to <IT>Dantzick</IT>, offer'd it at the same Price the Admiralty of <IT>Sweden</IT> paid for the last Lead they bought; but instead of that were obliged to let fall one sixth, and without any Composition for the bringing up and detention of their Ships.</P>
<P>Against this may be objected, that thereby the present Occasion may be served, but the Uncer&rehy;tainty become greater for the future.</P>
<P>To this I can only answer, That the <IT>Swedes</IT> must always by themselves or others, ship out their Pitch and Tar, and we shall therefore here&rehy;after be at as much Certainty as now. Besides, as those Directors have for many years monopo&rehy;lized, and reserv'd to themselves the Transpor&rehy;tation of all Pitch and Tar that goes to <IT>Holland</IT>, so I judge they intend to do in regard to <IT>England</IT> also, which if so, would fall hard both on our Traders in that Commodity, and on our Shipping employ'd hitherto in a good Proportion to fetch it: beside that the Price in <IT>England</IT> would be what the Monopolizers pleased.</P>
<P>These Inconveniencies will, I hope, be con&rehy;sider'd, and remedied one way or other.</P>
<P>I am also of opinion, that if the War with <IT>Muscovy</IT> be of any long Continuance, and In&rehy;roads be made into <IT>Finland</IT>, as most probably <PB
N="8">will, <IT>Sweden</IT> will not have such Quantities of Pitch and Tar to send abroad as the Occasions of <IT>Europe</IT> require.</P>
<P><IT>Courland</IT> furnished some formerly; but while the <IT>Swedes</IT> are Masters there, none can be ex&rehy;pected thence.</P>
<P>It is but very little, and not good, that <IT>Nor&rehy;way</IT> yields; and I suppose there is but very little Certainty it can be had from <IT>Muscovy</IT>.</P>
<P>What Difficulties there are in making and bringing it from <IT>New England</IT>, I am not ac&rehy;quainted with, but take it for granted <IT>England</IT> had better give one third more for it from thence, than have it at such Uncertainties, and in so preca&rehy;rious a manner from other Countries, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P></BODY></TEXT></QUOTE>
<P>The <IT>Swedes</IT> were so fond of their new Monopoly of Pitch and Tar, that I am assur'd, by the Com&rehy;mander of an <IT>English</IT> Merchant-Ship, who was at <IT>Stockholm</IT> in the Year 1710, that his was the first <IT>English</IT> Ship which had been there for six or seven Years; and that he made Application by some <IT>British</IT> Merchants residing there, to the Tar-Com&rehy;pany for a Loading of Pitch and Tar, offering them their own Prizes in ready Money: but no Interest could prevail, unless he would give Secu&rehy;rity not to carry the said Loading to <IT>London, Lis&rehy;bon</IT>, or any other Port where the Company had a Factory.</P>
<P>The People of <IT>England</IT> soon took the Alarm; the Merchants made strong Application for ma&rehy;king those Commodities in our own Plantations, and therefore that matter was brought before the Parliament, who gave the present Encouragement upon importing Pitch and Tar from our Planta&rehy;tions, which soon produced very great Quantities from thence, and they are now so very much en&rehy;creased, that we receive twice as much as the Na<PB
N="9">tion consumes, and are thereby enabled to export great Quantities to the <IT>Streights, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Bremen</IT>, and <IT>Hamburg</IT>.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd the Bounty given by the Govern&rehy;ment amounts to a large Sum yearly; but what we re-export and sell our Neighbours, makes the Kingdom amends for that Disbursement, and it has brought down the Price so low, that both Pitch and Tar are sold with us for less than one third part of the Price we once paid for <IT>Swedish</IT> Pitch and Tar: And if this way of supplying our selves from our own Plantations had not been found out, no body knows how high the <IT>Swedes</IT> might have raised their Price upon us, besides the Uncertainty of having it at any Price.</P>
<P>Upon the King of <IT>Sweden's</IT> Return from <IT>Bender</IT>, the Merchants were of Opinion, that his active and warlike Temper could not long sit still, and that a War would soon begin in the <IT>Baltick</IT>, which would be a great Interruption to our re&rehy;ceiving from thence Naval Stores, and also be ve&rehy;ry injurious to all Manufacturies that depended on them for Materials, but especially to the Iron Manufactury, Timber, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>What was fear'd soon came to pass, a War in the <IT>Baltick</IT> was begun, great Numbers of our Ships were seiz'd on frivolous Pretences, and car&rehy;ry'd into <IT>Swedish</IT> Ports, and condemned as Prize, to the unspeakable Damage of the Merchants of this Kingdom; for which no manner of Redress has been obtain'd.</P>
<P>The Lords Commissioners of Trade being sen&rehy;sible of the great Advantage of supplying our selves with Pitch and Tar from our own Planta&rehy;tions, sent to the Merchants to give them an ac&rehy;count what other Naval Stores might be produc'd and brought from thence.</P>
<PB N="10"><P>Their Lordships were told, that if Encourage&rehy;ment was given, and the People put into a pro&rehy;per way to begin, all other sorts of Naval Stores, as well as Pitch and Tar, might be brought from thence; that the <IT>Swedes</IT> had laid a new Duty on their Iron of near 25 <IT>per cent.</IT> and that the In&rehy;terruption of our Trade in the <IT>Baltick</IT> had great&rehy;ly distress'd our Iron Manufacturers for want of Iron to carry on their Business; and farther, that the <IT>Danes</IT> had rais'd their Boards from eight or nine Dollars, to eighteen Dollars <IT>per</IT> hundred: That Undertakings of this Nature (as in the Case of Pitch and Tar) would at least lower the Pri&rehy;ces, and lessen the Imports of <IT>Danish</IT> and <IT>Swedish</IT> Commodities, which at present drew from us a most prodigious Sum of Money. And, Lastly, it is manifest, that unless we import about 20,000 Tun of foreign Iron <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per annum</FOREIGN></IT>, our Ma&rehy;nufacturies cannot be compleatly carry'd on:
</P><P>For in the two Years before the War began in the <IT>Baltick</IT>, viz. 1714, and 1715. (in which Years we had a free Trade with <IT>Sweden</IT>) above 40,000 Tun was imported; and tho in the two following Years above 23000 Tun was imported, yet that being short of a sufficient Supply, it created terrible Complaints among the Manufacturers.</P>
<P>Now 20000 Tun of Iron, at 12<IT>l. per</IT> Tun, comes to 240,000<IT>l.</IT> and the Boards and Timber we re&rehy;ceive at their present advanc'd Price, comes to 200,000<IT>l.</IT> more; and if they found we could not o&rehy;therwise be supply'd, they would raise the Price on us.</P>
<P>And besides all this, the <IT>Danes</IT> and <IT>Swedes</IT> had usually the Navigation of all their own Boards and Timber, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> in their own Shipping; which Employment qualify'd them to breed up Seamen, and consequently, upon any Irruption, to fit out Ships for War and Privateers to annoy our Trade; and if so great an Advantage as bringing the <PB
N="11">said Commodities from our Plantations could be brought to pass, it would augment our Naviga&rehy;tion to the Plantations to more than double what it now is; and not only be an additional Em&rehy;ployment to our Ship-Builders, and all others concern'd therein, as well as to our Sailors and Seamen, but increase the Consumption of our Provisions, and other Necessaries for victualling and fitting out the said Ships; and that as our Navigation encreases, that of <IT>Sweden</IT> and <IT>Den&rehy;mark</IT> must of course sink, and our new Supply of Seamen will be the greatest additional Strength imaginable of able and useful Seamen to the Na&rehy;val Force of this Kingdom; which Sailors will be ready on all Occasions to man out our Fleets.</P>
<P>That in the Navigation we now carry on to our Plantations, it often happens that the Crops of Tobacco and Sugar, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> fall short; so that ma&rehy;ny of the Ships are forc'd to come home dead freighted, and some lie a whole Season for the next Crop, which (if Encouragement was given for bringing Timber, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> from our Plantations) would, upon such Disappointments, be sure of a Loading.</P>
<P>These Accounts were receiv'd with very great pleasure by their Lordships; and the Merchants, to promote so good a Work, waited on the Mi&rehy;nistry at the Board of Trade, who heard and thorowly examined what the Merchants had to offer.</P>
<P>And after they had been attended at a great many Meetings, and receiv'd full Satisfaction, that it would be greatly for the Advantage of this Na&rehy;tion to be supply'd with Naval Stores from our own Plantations, and very much enlarge the Ex&rehy;portation of our Woollen and other Manufactu&rehy;ries; a Motion was made for bringing a Bill in&rehy;to the House, which was accordingly agreed to <PB
N="12">by the House, and pass'd the Commons with a Clause, <Q>"That no Person or Persons within the said Plantations, or any of them, shall manu&rehy;facture any Iron Wares of any kind whatso&rehy;ever, out of any Sows, Pigs, or Bars whatso&rehy;ever, under the penalty of 
<GAP DESC="empty space" EXTENT="ca. 23 chars"> one part to such Person or Persons as shall seize or sue for the same, to be recover'd in any of his Majesty's Courts of Record at <IT>Westminster</IT>, or Court of <IT>Exchequer</IT> in <IT>Scotland</IT>, Courts of Admiralty, or other Courts of Record in the Plantations, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> the Proof to lie on the Pos&rehy;sessor."</Q> By this Clause no Smith in the Plan&rehy;tations might make so much as a Bolt, or Spike, or Nail.</P>
<P>This Clause must indeed have put the Colonies into a most miserable Condition; the Smith be&rehy;ing above all other Trades absolutely necessary for carrying on all other Employments: among the rest, that of Ship-Building had by it been utter&rehy;ly destroy'd, tho by this Article they make a great part of their Returns to <IT>England</IT> for purchasing our Manufactures.</P>
<P>And there was another Clause added in the House of Lords, <Q>"That from and after the 25th day of <IT>Decemb.</IT> 1719. no Forge going by Water, or other Work whatsoever, shall be erected or kept up in any of the said <IT>British</IT> Plantations, for the making, working, or converting any Sows, Pigs, or cast Iron, into Bar or Rod-Iron, upon pain, that if any Person from thenceforth erect or keep up, or cause to be erected or kept up any such Forge or other Work for the Use or Purpose aforesaid, such Person so offending, being thereof lawfully convict in any of his Ma&rehy;jesty's Courts of Record at <IT>Westminster</IT>, or in the Court of Exchequer in <IT>Scotland</IT>, or in the Court of Admiralty, or other Court of Record <PB
N="13">held in such Plantation where the Offence shall be committed, at the pleasure of the In&rehy;former, shall, for such his or her first Offence, suffer six Months Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprize, and for every other such Offence shall suffer six Months Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprize; and all Governors, or Commanders in Chief of the said Plantations, and every of them, now and for the time being, are hereby strictly requir'd not to suffer such Forge, or o&rehy;ther Work to be erected or kept up in any of the said Plantations within their respective Governments, contrary to the true Intent and Meaning hereof; and if any of the said Gover&rehy;nors or Commanders in Chief shall willingly or wittingly offend or be negligent in doing his Duty herein, upon Complaint and Proof made thereof before his Majesty, his Heirs and Suc&rehy;cessors, or such as shall be by him or them there&rehy;unto authoriz'd and appointed, by the Oath of two or more credible Witnesses, the said Go&rehy;vernor or Commander in Chief, so neglecting or offending, shall be remov'd from his Government."</Q></P>
<P>This second Clause must have ruin'd all those Iron-Works in the Colonies, to the great Loss of the Proprietors of them, and given the <IT>French</IT> a much fairer Handle to tempt them into their Settle&rehy;ments, which join to ours, than the Scarcity of Iron has given them to intice away our Artificers.</P>
<P>Which being duly consider'd, those Persons that were sollicitous for the Benefit of the Publick, de&rehy;sir'd the Bill should be dropt that Session, that the Members of both Houses might have time fully to inform themselves of the Advantages thereof.</P>
<P>Those Gentlemen who chiefly oppos'd this Undertaking, were concern'd in Iron-Works, who since the Interruption of the Trade with <IT>Sweden</IT>, have rais'd their Iron to an extraordinary Price: <PB
N="14">They did all they could to obstruct the Bill; they reported it would hinder the Exportation of wrought Iron to the Plantations, that it was on&rehy;ly a Trick of some Stock-Jobbers, and that it was carry'd on by some Persons that had a Grant from the Crown of some part of <IT>Nova Scotia</IT>.</P>
<P>All which were mere groundless Insinuations; for there never was a Design of making a Stock of it, nor were any Stock-Jobbers ever concern'd in the solliciting it, much less did any Person concern'd whatsoever think of a Grant from the Crown; neither was <IT>Nova Scotia</IT> the Place in&rehy;tended for carrying on the aforesaid Business, or thought to be proper for the said Undertaking.</P>
<P>But as the People of <IT>New England, New York, Pensylvania, Carolina</IT>, &amp;c. are under great Ne&rehy;cessities for <IT>English</IT> Manufactures, and an Incapa&rehy;city of providing Commodities to pay for them, has prevented the <IT>English</IT> Merchants from send&rehy;ing them those large Quantities that might be a sufficient Supply; and as inevitable Necessity has put them upon manufacturing for themselves; therefore this new Employment of providing Na&rehy;val Stores, was propos'd to take them off the Manufactures that interfere with ours.</P>
<P>But making a Monopoly or Stock of it, would utterly destroy the very Intentions of the Naval Store-Bill, force the Planters to continue to ma&rehy;nufacture for themselves, and prevent the export&rehy;ing our Manufactures thither.</P>
<P>Those Joint-Stocks or Companies, that have been erected for carrying on a Trade to the Planta&rehy;tions, have been found very prejudicial, and their Capitals have been quite traded away, and entire&rehy;ly lost to the Proprietors.</P>
<P>Upon examining our Exportation of wrought Iron to the Plantations, it appears that the same amounts to about 1300 Tun yearly; the full half <PB
N="15">of it goes to <IT>Jamaica, Barbadoes</IT>, and the other Sugar-Islands.</P>
<P>But if we allow seven hundred Tun to the Plantations on the Continent, about one half of that goes to <IT>Virginia</IT> and <IT>Maryland</IT>, where they have better Employment than to set hands to the making Iron Wares, and make sufficient Returns for themselves.</P>
<P>Therefore it may be concluded, that these Plan&rehy;tations, as well as the Sugar-Islands, will never concern themselves in making Iron-Manufactures; so that the whole that can be in danger is the re&rehy;maining 350 Ton.</P>
<P>Now the Manufactury of all this 350 Ton, allowing full 12<IT>s. per</IT> Hundred Workmanship, comes but to 4200<IT>l.</IT> a Sum not worth mention&rehy;ing.</P>
<P>'Tis then very obvious, there was no reason for the aforesaid Oppositions.</P>
<P>If these Gentlemens Care had been for the Good of the Publick, why were the Woollen, Linen, and Leather Manufacturies, Hats, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> neglected?</P>
<P>Is it not as much the Interest of <IT>England</IT> to preserve the Exportation of those Manufacturies, as that of Iron?</P>
<P>But if our Plantations, that have thirteen or fourteen Iron-Works employ'd in making Bar or Pig-Iron, were encouraged to bring it home, it would not only secure the Trade we now have with them, but enlarge it.</P>
<P>This Rise of Iron is a very severe Tax on Wag&rehy;goners, Carriers, and Farmers, <IT>viz.</IT> on the Tire of their Waggons, Carts, Plough-Shares, and o&rehy;ther Iron-Works.</P>
<P>It is three Half-pence or two Pence <IT>per</IT> Horse&rehy;Shoe upon all large Waggon-Horses and Coach&rehy;Horses in and about <IT>London</IT>, and a Penny on the <PB
N="16">least Shoe that is made; and I suppose it may be near the same in other Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>'Tis also a most prodigious Discouragement to all our Ship-building.</P>
<P>We can't expect to make Anchors, Bolts, or any other Iron-Works, for the <IT>Streights, Spain</IT>, or <IT>Portugal</IT>, nor find a Market abroad for our Iron&rehy;Rails, Gates, and other nice Iron-Works; the I&rehy;ron being so much cheaper in <IT>Holland, Germany, Flanders</IT>, &amp;c. will cause our Workmen to go thither to supply foreign Markets.</P>
<P>But tho we have as good Opportunities of ma&rehy;king Iron as any Place in the Universe by our own People in our own Plantations, the Profit of which would be spent among us; yet we must not improve them: A Circumstance hard to be ac&rehy;counted for!</P>
<P>If it had not been for this Restraint upon the Iron-Trade, we might have had the fitting out of our own <IT>Guinea</IT> Ships; but the <IT>Dutch</IT> undersel&rehy;ling us in Guns, Knives, and other Iron-Works, have thereby ingrossed the fitting out whole Car&rehy;goes.</P>
<P>It must be owned the Distress of the Poor Ma&rehy;nufacturers is very great: The Dearness and Scar&rehy;city of Iron has thrown abundance of them out of work; and those that continue to work, have such large Deductions out of their usual Wages, that they meet with great Difficulties to find Bread for their Families.</P>
<P>The Iron-Manufacture is said to be the third in the Kingdom; and that not less than 200,000 Per&rehy;sons are employ'd in it.</P>
<P>The Waste and Destruction of the Woods in <IT>Warwick, Stafford, Worcester, Hereford, Monmouth, Glocester</IT>, and <IT>Shrop</IT>, Shires, by these Iron-Works, is not to be imagined.</P>
<PB N="17"><P>The Scarcity of Wood is already grown so great, that where Cord-Wood has been sold at six or seven Shillings <IT>per</IT> Cord within these few Years, it is now risen to fourteen or fifteen Shil&rehy;lings; and in some Places is all consumed.
</P><P>The Iron-Works are got among the Woods in <IT>Glamorganshire</IT>, and have begun on the small Quan&rehy;tity in <IT>Pembrokeshire</IT>, which can stand but a little time <IT>before them</IT>.</P>
<P>And if some Care is not taken to preserve our Timber from these consuming Furnaces, there will not be Oak enough left to supply the Royal Navy, nor Shipping for the Use of the Merchant, to the great Discouragement of Ship-building and Na&rehy;vigation, upon which the Safety and Figure of these Kingdoms, as a Maritime Power, depends.</P>
<P>It is generally allowed, that within these sixty Years, <IT>Ireland</IT> was better stored with Oak-Timber than we are; but several Gentlemen from hence, as well as those residing there, set up Iron-works, which in a few Years swept away the Wood to that degree, that they have not small Stuff left to produce Bark for their Tanning, nor Timber for common and necessary Uses.</P>
<P>Their Distress is so great, that they are forced to send to <IT>England</IT> and elsewhere for Bark, and to <IT>Norway, &amp;c.</IT> for Building-Timber, and suffer their large Hides to be exported to <IT>Holland, Ger&rehy;many</IT>, and <IT>Flanders</IT>, where (to the loss of that Manufactury) they are tanned: and every Body is sensible of the Damage it must be to a Kingdom to lose their Manufacturies, and how difficult it is to regain them.</P>
<P>For if we consider Manufacturies and Naviga&rehy;tion in general, we shall find that Kingdoms and States are more or less rich, as they have a greater or lesser Share of Manufacturies and Naviga&rehy;tion.</P>
<PB N="18"><P>If we take a view of <IT>Denmark, Switzerland, Bohemia</IT>, and other Parts of <IT>Germany</IT>, we shall find the common People so miserably poor, that they think themselves happy when they have an Opportunity of listing for Soldiers, and are al&rehy;ways desirous of hiring out their Troops to be maintain'd by their Neighbours, and to receive the small Returns of Money they are capable of send&rehy;ing home out of their Pay.
</P><P>If we likewise take a view of our own King&rehy;dom, we shall find our Trade and Riches came in but very slowly till our Plantations began to be set&rehy;tled; and as they throve, our Trade and Riches encreased, our Lands rose in value, and our Manu&rehy;facturies encreased also.</P>
<P>And there are Reasons enough to be assigned for it, which I may at a proper time more fully de&rehy;monstrate.</P>
<P>'Tis generally agreed, the Sugar and Tobacco Plantations only, employ 300 Sail of Ships, which may be allowed to find Employment for 6000 Sailors; and they and their Families are all main&rehy;tained by this Navigation.</P>
<P>Allowing each Ship to be worth 2000<IT>l.</IT> fitted out to Sea, there must be 600,000<IT>l.</IT> of the Na&rehy;tional Stock employ'd in this Shipping, beside their Cargoes.</P>
<P>The Advantages of victualling such a Number of Ships must be very considerable.</P>
<P>The Dependants on this Trade, and their Fa&rehy;milies, are all supported and maintained thereby; such as Ship-Carpenters, Joiners, Caulkers, Sail&rehy;makers, Rope-makers, Anchor-Smiths, Block&rehy;makers, Ship-Chandlers, Bakers, Brewers, Butch&rehy;ers, Lightermen, Wharfingers, Porters, and Car&rehy;men, beside many other Employments.</P>
<P>And further, let those who are versed in Poli&rehy;ticks, consider how much the natural Bulworks of <PB
N="19">this Island are maintained, repaired, and aug&rehy;mented by so great a Number of the best of Sailors.</P>
<P>It has been affirmed by some very good Judges, that before the Settlement of our Plantations, we paid 400,000<IT>l.</IT> yearly for <IT>Brazil</IT> Sugars; that we paid the <IT>Spaniards</IT> 100<IT>l. per</IT> Ton for Logwood, and an extravagant Price for a great many other Commodities, with which we are now supplied by our own Plantations.</P>
<P>And Sir <IT>Josiah Child</IT> tells us, that in his time <IT>Brazil</IT> Sugars were beat down by the <IT>English</IT> Su&rehy;gars from 7 or 8<IT>l.</IT> to 50<IT>s.</IT> or 3<IT>l. per</IT> Hundred; and the Quantity imported from the <IT>Brazils</IT> from 100,000 or 120,000 Chests, to 30,000 Chests.</P>
<P>And by another Author we are also told, that <IT>Brazil</IT> Tobacco stood us from 4<IT>s.</IT> to 8<IT>s. per</IT> Pound.</P>
<P>If we consumed but half the Quantity of Su&rehy;gar then that we now do, and it cost us 7 or 8<IT>l. per</IT> Hundred, it must stand the Nation in a Sum greatly exceeding 400,000<IT>l.</IT> yearly.</P>
<P>And had the Consumption of Tobacco been then as great as it now is, it would have amoun&rehy;ted to a Sum that would exceed my Calcula&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>But now those Colonies do not only supply us with all the Tobacco and Sugar we consume, but send us above the Value of 500,000<IT>l.</IT> yearly for Re-exportation, beside Ginger, Cotton, Wool, Indigo, and many other Commodities, out of which great Numbers of Gentlemen and Planters who reside with us, are maintained; and very large Sums of Money laid out in Lands in this Kingdom, which has exceedingly raised the landed Interest.</P>
<P>Sir <IT>Josiah Child</IT> computes, that every white Man in the Sugar Plantations employs four Persons at home to provide him and his Negroes with Wear<PB
N="20">ables, Houshold-Goods, and all other Necessaries for carrying on the Work of the Plantations: And all agree that every Person employ'd in Manufacturies for Exportation, adds a considerable yearly Value to the publick Stock of this Nation.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all the Advantages we re&rehy;ceive from the Plantations, I am fully of opinion that that Trade might be so improved as to be twice as good to this Kingdom as it now is.</P>
<P>And that a little Care to put the People there into a way to send us their Commodities, and Productions, would cause them to throw away their Woollen, Linen, and other Manufacturies that interfere with this Kingdom, as <IT>Virginia</IT> has done upon the late Act for encouraging the Expor&rehy;tation of Tobacco.</P>
<P>And as soon as those Favours are granted them, and they have made some progress therein, I doubt not but we shall see a new Scene opened, additio&rehy;nal Manufacturies carrying on in <IT>Great Britain</IT>; and Gentlemen would find new Houses built upon their Estates, Towns encrease, and Lands rise about them; Corn, Cattle, and all sorts of Pro&rehy;visions, go off quick, and at a better Price: for where Employment is to be found, Workmen will resort, and Numbers of People will create Consumption.</P>
<P>I know several People are very fond of shipping out Corn, and we allow a considerable Bounty to encourage it: And it is very well to have a Mar&rehy;ket when we have more Corn than we can spend. But few consider the Advantages of sending abroad our Woollen and other Manufacturies made of Materials within our selves.</P>
<P>If we compare the National Advantages of ship&rehy;ping out Corn, and also of our Woollen Manu&rehy;facturies, we shall find the sending out the Value of 100<IT>l.</IT> in Woollen Manufacturies to be full as <PB
N="21">good as sending out the same Value in Corn.</P>
<P>For both Corn and Wool are our natural Pro&rehy;duct; and Manufactury is the Labour of our own People, as well as Plowing, Sowing, Reaping, and Threshing.</P>
<P>Ploughing, Threshing, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> can only be per&rehy;formed by able Men; but in woollen Manufactu&rehy;ries Women and Children find Employment, and are useful in carrying it on as well as Men: Every Body may be employ'd in Manufacturies, but few in Tillage.</P>
<P>It's thought we export above twenty times the Value in Manufacturies, that we possibly can do in Corn.</P>
<P>The foreign Markets for Corn are very uncer&rehy;tain and precarious; but our Exportation of Ma&rehy;nufacturies may be render'd more steady and cer&rehy;tain, and Encouragement may open new Markets.</P>
<P>Our great Care and Study therefore ought to be to enlarge the Exports of our Manufactures, where there is so much room for Improvement; but more especially to our own Plantations, where it is in our power to enable them to purchase all their Clothing of us.</P>
<P>'Tis the Prudence of the <IT>Dutch</IT> to draw all the ingenious Artists and Manufacturers they can into their Dominions.</P>
<P>They also take care that all Materials for Ma&rehy;nufacturies be render'd as cheap as possible: And this Fore-sight of theirs has enabled them to do those Wonders by Trade which they have done. And the <IT>French</IT> are now vigorously persuing the same Methods.</P>
<P>And it is the Opinion of a great many judicious Gentlemen, that if we, in like manner, endea&rehy;vour'd to draw in Artists and Manufacturers into this Nation, we might very easily consume the Corn among ourselves which we now export: <PB
N="22">That one Bushel of Wheat spent at home by ad&rehy;ditional Manufacturers is of six times the advan&rehy;tage to the Nation as a Bushel shipped abroad; because in spending one Bushel of Wheat at home, there is five times the Value spent in Flesh, and all sorts of Provisions, Beer, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> that is to say, the Value of one hundred thousand Pounds spent in Wheat, would create the Consumption of five hundred thousand Pound of the other Products of the Earth, beside the Addition of Clothing, House-rent, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>But instead of a Bounty, or the Duty drawn back on wrought Iron, it pays <GAP DESC="empty space" EXTENT="ca. 10 chars"> <IT>per Cent.</IT> outwards, and 20 <IT>per Cent.</IT> Custom inwards.</P>
<P>There is a very great Duty on several sorts of Dying-Stuffs, which makes our woollen Manufactures go dear abroad; a great Excise on Soap, Candles, Leather, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> And if those Duties are not taken off, it is greatly to be fear'd the <IT>Dutch</IT> and <IT>French</IT> will have an Advantage over us in Manufactu&rehy;ries, and draw away many of our Manufacturers also.</P>
<P>As I have already mention'd the Advantage we receive by the Sugar and Tobacco-Plantations, I shall now shew the Difficulties some of the Colo&rehy;nies are under for want of being put into a way to make Returns, particularly <IT>New England</IT>.</P>
<P>Their great Delight is to wear <IT>English</IT> Manufac&rehy;tures, but the Difficulty of coming at them is very great; hitherto they have found no Silver Mines, and have never been put into a way to provide any thing to send us, that the Coun&rehy;try produces, but Pitch and Tar, Turpentine, and Ships of their own building. Those Articles will go but a little way towards clothing such a Number of People, and therefore they are forced to visit the <IT>Spanish</IT> Coast, where they pick up any Commodity they can traffick for, to carry Lum<PB
N="23">ber and Provisions to the Sugar-Plantations, and to the Logwood-Cutters at <IT>Campeachy</IT>, and there exchange them for the Product of those Islands, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> which they generally send to us; they are forced to catch Fish, to make Pipe and Barrel&rehy;Staves, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> which they send to <IT>Portugal, Spain</IT>, or the <IT>Straits</IT>; and lastly to build a great Num&rehy;ber of Ships, the only Manufactury (except Tur&rehy;pentine, Pitch, and Tar) in that Country, that they can send us, which they often sell with their Cargoes in <IT>Portugal</IT>, and other Parts of <IT>Europe</IT>, as well as in <IT>England</IT>.</P>
<P>By these Methods they make a shift to scrape up about 150,000<IT>l. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per annum</FOREIGN></IT>, to pay for the Goods they buy of us. 'Tis almost incredible that they should be capable of raising so great a Sum; and yet if they could find out Methods to raise more Money, their Demands for our Manufactures for their Supply would be vastly greater; for want of which they are forced to fall on the Woollen, Linen, Iron, and Leather Manufacturies, or any other wherein their Servants or Negroes can be serviceable to them.</P>
<P>This hath given great Uneasiness to the Manu&rehy;facturers and Merchants, as well as Sailors of this Kingdom, and occasion'd many to say, that they strive to carry away our Trade; that they have, great and small, near 300 Sail of Ships in <IT>New&rehy;England</IT> alone.</P>
<P>But the Persons, who have received such No&rehy;tions, ought to consider, that this Number con&rehy;sists mostly of small coasting Sloops; and that as to their larger Ships, the Merchants of <IT>Great Britain</IT> are Owners in great Part; and from these Ships, and their Cargoes, is produc'd all the Mo&rehy;ney we receive for our Manufactures.</P>
<P>If they had more Ships, and as well employ'd, that could be sold with their Cargoes in <IT>Europe</IT>, the <PB
N="24">Demand for our Manufactures would be so much the more enlarg'd, as the Opportunity of making Returns amounts to.</P>
<P>But if they had Encouragement, we might re&rehy;ceive all our Naval Stores from them, which we now have from <IT>Sweden, Norway</IT>, &amp;c. and for which we are forced to pay in Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>For our own Plantations abound with divers sorts of Wood, viz. Gum-Wood, Mehoggony, Wild Cherry, Chestnut, Cypress, Cedar, Wallnut, Hickery, Oak, as well as the common sorts of Wood which we receive from <IT>Sweden, Norway</IT>, and <IT>Germany</IT>; which (if the Duties were taken off) might be imported cheaper than we have them from thence. They have made excellent Pot-ashes, they produce very good Flax, have rais'd very great Quantities of it, and have be&rehy;gun on Hemp; which grows so high on rich Grounds, that 'tis difficult to dress it at full Length.</P>
<P>In <IT>Carolina</IT> they produce the best Rice in the World; and if that Trade was well directed, it might supply <IT>Portugal, Spain</IT>, and <IT>Italy</IT> with it, as well as the other Parts of <IT>Europe</IT>.</P>
<P>They have extraordinary rich Copper-Mines: and if search was made, 'tis thought some of a better nature may be found.</P>
<P>They have Iron-Stone all along the Continent, from the Southermost Parts of <IT>Carolina</IT>, to the Northermost Part of <IT>New England</IT>, in great Plen&rehy;ty; some of it, upon Trial, has made extraordi&rehy;nary good tough Iron, and very good Steel.</P>
<P>No Part of the World abounds more with prodigious Quantities of Wood, nor has more Rivers and Streams than that Part of the Conti&rehy;nent. There is so much Wood, that the great Charge of the Planter is to clear the Ground.</P>
<PB N="25"><P>And as no one Undertaking consumes so much Wood as Iron-Works, if they were erected, the Land would be cleared of the Wood, the Air puri&rehy;fied, the Ground made fit for Hemp and Flax, and the best Timber might be preserv'd for bringing home.
</P><P>In charcoaling the Wood, there will be a very good Opportunity of drawing Pitch and Tar out of the Pine-Trees; and no Wood, according to the best Observation, makes better Charcoal for Iron-Works: and all this without any other Charge than providing Fewel for the Iron&rehy;Works, such a De&rehy;pendency have these Operations one upon another.</P>
<P>And as there are so many Circumstances that at&rehy;tend the making Iron in our own Plantations, if proper Encouragement was given, it may be brought to a very great Perfection, and such Quan&rehy;tities made, as to exceed in value any other Pro&rehy;duct of our Plantations.</P>
<P>Iron is a Commodity of universal Use, staple, and certain in all Parts of the known World; con&rehy;sequently as much to be valued as Silver or Gold; a Commodity that will be carried every where as Ballast, at little or no Charge.</P>
<P>And whereas the <IT>Dutch</IT> do supply <IT>Portugal</IT>, the <IT>Straits</IT>, and <IT>Turkey</IT> with great Quantities, if we could be so happy as to have a full Supply from our own Plantations, either by Adventurers from hence, who would lay out their Estates in erecting Iron-Works, or in Exchange for the Woollen or other Manufactures which we export to those Places; we should not only ballast our Ships with Iron, but export great Quantities, not only all over the <IT>Straits</IT> and <IT>Turkey</IT>, but even to <IT>India</IT> and <IT>Africa</IT>; and soon become Masters of a good part of the Trade.</P>
<P>And as we were once dependant on the <IT>Swedes</IT> for Pitch and Tar, we must remain so still to them for Iron, as we must to <IT>Norway</IT> and to them for <PB
N="26">Boards and Timber, and to <IT>Muscovy</IT> for Hemp, unless some Care is taken to relieve us from such a Dependency: For tho 'tis probable we shall soon have a sufficient Supply of Iron from <IT>Sweden</IT>, yet upon any new Rupture with any of them, our Ma&rehy;nufacturers may be put to the same Difficulty as they have lately been under.</P>
<P>And as the <IT>Czar</IT> has all the principal Ports from whence we receive our Supply of Hemp in his own Hands, it is more than probable that he will endea&rehy;vour to play the same Game that <IT>Sweden</IT> did with their Pitch and Tar, <IT>viz.</IT> oblige us to receive it by his own Shipping, and at his own Prizes. Possibly this was what was aimed at in the Projects some&rehy;time since offer'd to <IT>England, France</IT>, and <IT>Holland</IT>, one after another; and for the same Reason might be rejected by them all. It is therefore very dan&rehy;gerous for us to depend on a Supply of Hemp from those that endeavour to get from us a part of our Trade and Navigation.</P>
<P>'Tis said the <IT>French</IT> have transported above 20,000 People to their new Settlements of <IT>Missi&rehy;sippi</IT> within this little time: and as they are so sensible of the Advantage of Colonies, and can by degrees compass all their Designs (witness <IT>His&rehy;paniola, Cape Breton</IT>, and <IT>Newfoundland</IT>) I believe almost every Body will agree 'tis now time to look about us: And since they go on with such extraor&rehy;dinary Vigour in transporting great Numbers of People, and give so great Encouragement to those who will transport themselves thither, and have made such strong Forts all along the River <IT>Canada</IT>, and on the back of our Settlements, it will be well if they admit our Limits to come near them.</P>
<P>We indeed claim a vast Tract of Land to the Westward of <IT>Carolina, Virginia, &amp;c.</IT> but we find the <IT>French</IT> have brought their Settlements already close to the back of ours. The late <IT>French</IT> King <PB
N="27">having granted all the Lands bordering on the <IT>English</IT> Settlements of <IT>Carolina, &amp;c.</IT> to the Sieur <IT>Crozat</IT>, in which the River <IT>Avabash</IT> is included, which runs close to the <IT>Apalatinan</IT> Mountains, (Hills that run above the Heads of those Rivers which have their Course thro <IT>Carolina</IT> and <IT>Virginia</IT>,) Places most convenient to build Forts for protect&rehy;ing the Skin-Trade, and vending our Woollen and other Commodities; 'tis thought some valuable Mines are contain'd in those Mountains. If they should seize them, or lay hold of part of them, and afterwards on the Heads of the Rivers leading in&rehy;to the <IT>Virginian</IT> Sea, and desire to carry their Na&rehy;vigation that way, it may in time create Misunder&rehy;standings.</P>
<P>In my humble Opinion, the surest way to pre&rehy;serve our Claims and Properties to our Colonies, is by peopling them, as the <IT>French</IT> do theirs; and building Forts and Settlements on our Frontiers, as they do on theirs. Their Navigation is so far up, both the Rivers <IT>Canada</IT> and <IT>Missisippi</IT>, that, <CORR
SIC="not&rehy;standing">not&rehy;withstanding</CORR> the great care taken, they will often want Supplys: and our Plantations lying all along the Sea-Coasts, with the River <IT>Canada</IT> and <IT>Missisippi</IT> on our Backs; and their Settlements being on those Rivers, and about the great Lakes, ours and theirs will be so near, that it will be impossible to prevent their supplying themselves with Woollen and other Goods from our Frontiers.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the <IT>Missisippi</IT> Compa&rehy;ny will give their own People all the Encou&rehy;ragement that can be thought on; for 'tis said a great number of Negroes will be dis&rehy;tributed among them at the Company's Charge, and that experienced judicious Persons will be ap&rehy;pointed to examine and consider what Productions may be raised from the several Parts of the Country, and proper Directors appointed to see <PB
N="28">that the People go on regularly in raising what e&rehy;very Part is most capable of producing, till the Planters shall have Skill and Experience to con&rehy;duct their own Affairs, and the Tract is perfectly beaten out, and the People settled in it.</P>
<P>If the <IT>French</IT> Settlements have all these Encou&rehy;ragements, and ours should be debarr'd making Iron, and not encouraged to send it home in Pig or Bar, nor admitted to send home their Boards and Timber, and the other Commodities which I have already mention'd, 'tis easy to judge by the Artificers they get from us, what Draughts they will make out of our Plantations, for there is not so much as a Hedge between us and them to prevent it.</P>
<P>Our greatest Security, and the readiest way to enrich this Nation, is to give the Plantations En&rehy;couragement towards the producing those Com&rehy;modities before-mention'd, and any other that may be of advantage to us and them. No doubt People from all Parts, who are now made uneasy, would be glad to remove to such desirable Coun&rehy;tries as our Plantations are, much more desirable than those of the <IT>French</IT>, because the Navigation is not attended with the Difficulties of sailing some hundreds of Miles, up dangerous Gulphs, be&rehy;fore they can come at their Port.</P>
<P>A great many Families have transported them&rehy;selves from several Parts of <IT>Germany, Poland, &amp;c.</IT> to our Plantations; and a little Encouragement would draw great numbers thither.</P>
<P>'Tis certain a very great Treasure may be gain'd to this Nation by peopling our Colonies: It is therefore to be wished, that some Countenance was given to several sorts of laborious People, both in <IT>Germany</IT> and <IT>Switzerland</IT>, who are but in&rehy;differently treated in their respective Countries, to transport themselves thither.</P>
<PB N="29"><P>I think it will sufficiently appear, that the En&rehy;couragement of making Pitch and Tar in the Plantations has made us independant for those Commoditys; that now we have no need to bribe any Ministry, nor supplicate any Prince in the World to supply us with them <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Vid.</FOREIGN> <IT>Dr.</IT> Robinson's <IT>Letter before recited</IT>.</NOTE> for our Gold and Silver; also that our Plantations can effectually supply us with all other naval Stores; and that if they had Encouragement to pro&rehy;vide Iron, Hemp, Flax, Boards and Timber, we should be effectually supplied with all those Com&rehy;modities, not only for our own Use, but for Re&rehy;exportation; and that as soon as the Planters had other Employments to turn their hands to, they would presently abate sending Pitch and Tar in so great Quantities; and what they did send would be as good as that from <IT>Sweden</IT>, as I am credibly informed some of it is which is lately arrived.
</P><P>And not only so, but more Commodities and Goods to greater value, may be brought home for Re-exportation than what we now re-export of the Product of our Sugar and Tobacco Plantations, and that the additional Navigation to our Plan&rehy;tations will be more than double what it now is.</P>
<P>That as the great Obstruction to the Naval Store-Bill was the Fear of injuring our Iron&rehy;Manufacturys, nothing can hinder it so much as preventing their sending us what they can raise from their natural Product and Soil.</P>
<P>For as they have 14 or 15 Iron-works, as I have already hinted, if they can't have liberty to bring hither Bar or Cast-Iron, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> they will want Ef&rehy;fects to purchase Iron and other Manufactures with us, and consequently must be forced to work up their own Iron, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> whereas if they might <PB
N="30">export hither those Commodities I have mention'd, they might barter them for manufactured-Iron, and other Manufactures.</P>
<P>But because 'tis pretended that the Iron Manu&rehy;facturies of this Kingdom might be damaged, and our Exportation of Iron to the Plantations lessen'd, by making Iron there; and that therefore the great Advantages that would come both to us and the Plantations by the Naval Store-Bill must be lost:</P>
<P>I shall, before I conclude this Letter, propose a Method that I hope will sufficiently satisfy the Gentlemen that are really under those Apprehen&rehy;sions, and preserve not only that Manufactury to us, but also shew how our Navigation may be ma&rehy;naged so as to prevent the Inconveniencies which are alledged we receive from the <IT>New-England</IT> Ships, and leave to them the same Advantages which we enjoy in our Navigation.</P>
<P>But I would first say something of the Advanta&rehy;ges the Colonies will receive by turning their hands from the Manufactures which interfere with ours, and employing themselves in providing the afore&rehy;said Commodities for sending home.</P>
<P>That which has enabled our Tobacco-Planta&rehy;tions to outdo the Tobacco-Planters of <IT>Europe</IT>, is the Cheapness of their Land, and the cheap Work of their Negroes. They have their Lands at a small Quit-rent, which will enable them, when once got into the way of it, to outdo <IT>Russia</IT> it self in the Cheapness of their Hemp and Flax, as it has done in Tobacco. They are now at a very great Charge to clear their Ground of Wood, which when cut down is of no manner of use to them; but a small Addition to their pre&rehy;sent Charge, would make it into Charcoal or Pot-ashes.</P>
<PB N="31"><P>The <IT>Russians</IT> bring their Hemp and Flax, which is shipt off at <IT>Archangel</IT>, above 500 Miles by Land&rehy;Carriage, and above a thousand Miles down the <IT>Dwina</IT>, before 'tis put on board: But our Plan&rehy;tations lie all along the Continent, near the Sea&rehy;Coast, and there are every where Rivers navigable into the Country. Geat part of the Land is very rich, and fit for Hemp and Flax; and 'tis a much easier Navigation from thence to <IT>England</IT>, than it is from <IT>Archangel</IT>.
</P><P>Hemp and Flax require very rich and strong Land, which must be often dunged; but in the Plantations, when it has bore 2 or 3 Crops, their Land is of so small value, they can afford to lay it down till it recover itself, and break up fresh Ground. By these Methods the Productions of the Land will soon stock them with Hemp, Flax, Boards, and Timber, which will enable them to purchase our Woollen and other Manufactures.</P>
<P>And when this Privilege is given, many of them would be content that a Bounty was allow'd to import their Wool into <IT>England</IT>, as well as their Hides, because every thing (as they say) would help to pay for our Manufactures, which are ready prepared for them.</P>
<P>This Method would contribute to enrich this Nation; and it will not only be a Happiness to us to have their Wool to manufacture, but it will take it out of their way.</P>
<P>The Blanket-Makers of <IT>Whitney</IT> will be glad of the worst of it, and work it up into Blankets, and send it them again wrought up, which at this time is a very great Trade to the Plantations.</P>
<P>We should by this means transfer the Employ&rehy;ment we give the <IT>Danes</IT> and <IT>Swedes</IT> (which we pay dearly for in Gold and Silver) to our own Peo&rehy;ple in the Plantations, and pay them for their Labour and Productions with the Labour and Ma<PB
N="32">nufactures of this Kingdom; and at the same time have the whole Navigation to our selves.</P>
<P>In the third Year of the late Queen's Reign, a Bill pass'd for allowing a Bounty on Hemp im&rehy;ported from the Plantations, which was again re&rehy;new'd in the twelfth Year of her Reign for eleven Years longer, which time draws towards a Con&rehy;clusion; and as no Persons have undertaken to import any Hemp into this Kingdom all this time, 'tis not likely they should now begin, un&rehy;less there be a farther time granted for allowing a Bounty.</P>
<P>And whereas there was no notice taken of Flax in that Bill, if the same Bounty was allowed on Flax as on Hemp, it might have induced the Planters to sow both together; for they are Com&rehy;modities sowed in the same sort of Ground, and order'd in the same manner: If one fails, the o&rehy;ther may hit. They are both naval Stores, Flax being used in making Sail-Cloth.</P>
<P>But beside, it will be of extraordinary advantage to the Nation: For the Lands in <IT>Great Britain</IT> be&rehy;ing (as I have already observed) too dear for sow&rehy;ing Flax, and therefore the Quantity sowed not allowing work for above four or five Months in the Year, many thousand of People both in the North of <IT>England</IT> and <IT>Scotland</IT> are unimploy'd all the rest of the Year.</P>
<P>'Tis by such Misfortunes that People learn idle Habits, and with difficulty are brought to work again: But if they were kept at full Work, they would make twice the Quantity of Linens that are now made. And the extraordinary Plenty of Flax that might be produced by this Encourage&rehy;ment, would give opportunity to many thousands of People, now out of Employment, to fall into this Manufactury; and we need not go far for a Market, ours being the best in <IT>Europe</IT>.</P>
<PB N="33"><P>Where care is taken by the State to put their People into proper Methods, many fair Opportu&rehy;nities of enriching Kingdoms are gained.
</P><P>The late <IT>French</IT> King, stirred up by the power&rehy;ful Opposition he met with upon his invading the Provinces of <IT>Holland</IT>, found that Treasure, and not Largeness of Territory, was what enabled the <IT>Dutch</IT> to oppose him; that their Riches arose from their Manufactures, Trade, and Navigation: and therefore he determined to follow their Example.</P>
<P>The first Undertaking was to tempt skilful Mas&rehy;ter-Workmen and Manufacturers from other Coun&rehy;tries.</P>
<P>The Golden Bait was laid before <IT>Vanroby</IT>, a <IT>Dutchman</IT>, who took it; and in consideration of a large Sum advanc'd him, and Liberty of Conscience to him and all his Descendants, and a Minister of his own Persuasion allowed to preach to them, he removed to <IT>Abbeville</IT>, with a Train of Workmen. And 'tis remarkable that this was done about the same time that the <IT>French</IT> King persecuted his own Subjects for their Religion.</P>
<P>By this means the Woollen Manufactury was established there, and spread it self into several other Parts of <IT>France</IT>; and divers other valuable Improvements were made in Trade, not only in providing Materials for Manufacturies on the very best Terms, and enlarging their Navigation, but in peopling their Colonies abroad.</P>
<P>The Spirit of Trade that then began among them, has continued ever since, and seems now to rise higher than ever.</P>
<P>Their stealing away some of our Weavers to settle at <IT>Tankerville</IT> so lately, and several other At&rehy;tempts which they have succeeded in, shows how necessary it is to be upon our guard, and, if possi&rehy;ble, to keep our Workmen to our selves; for if the <IT>French</IT> Emissaries can come at them, there will <PB
N="34">be no Encouragements wanting to tempt 'em away.</P>
<P>And the Emperor is now trying to establish Woollen Manufacturies in his hereditary Domi&rehy;nions: and the Methods taken to restrain and obstruct the Consumption of our Woollen Manu&rehy;factures in those Countries, amount to a Prohibi&rehy;tion upon several sorts of them; tho, at the same time, our greatest Supply of Linen is from his Provinces of <IT>Silesia, Bohemia</IT>, and <IT>Moravia</IT>, which amount to a vast Sum yearly.</P>
<P>If part of that Money could be saved, by find&rehy;ing Employment for more of our Poor in the Linen Manufactury, I hope it would be very pleasing to every Body: and I am humbly of opinion, that al&rehy;lowing a Bounty on Hemp and Flax from the Plan&rehy;tations would effect it.</P>
<P>Indeed all the Naval Stores proposed in that Bill are Commodities which we are forced to have from abroad, for which we pay mostly ready Mony.</P>
<P>I know several People have a very mean Opi&rehy;nion of the Linen Manufactury; but that must proceed from want of knowing it better.</P>
<P>The Manufactury of Linen may be altogether as profitable as that of Wool.</P>
<P>Some Persons both in <IT>Somersetshire</IT> and <IT>Dorsetshire</IT>, that threw off the Woollen Manufactury at the Revolution, and went upon making Linens, have found the Advantages thereof.</P>
<P>As we cannot have Flax and Hemp grow but on our best Lands, and many Landlords not allow&rehy;ing their Tenants the Liberty of sowing either Flax or Hemp, because it impoverishes the Land; for this reason there is but a poor Progress made at home in that Manufactury, to what it is capable of.</P>
<P>The Flax is inconsiderable in value to what it is when made into Cloth: A Pound manufactured may be worth a whole hundred Weight of Flax.</P>
<PB N="35"><P>And a Bounty given the People in the Planta&rehy;tions, is but a mere Trifle towards their Labour; the Extent and Cheapness of their Lands, and cheap Labour of their Slaves, will enable them in a little time to afford it us much cheaper than we can raise it our selves, or import it from <IT>Russia</IT> or any other foreign Market. The Pitch and Tar already men&rehy;tion'd is a full Proof thereof; and the People in the Plantations want nothing but a little Direction and Encouragement to put them to work.
</P><P>It is a hard Matter to turn People from the Employment, to which they have been accustom'd, to a new one; and as Necessity put the Inhabitants of the Plantations on Manufacturies for their Clothing, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> if this new Employment be pro&rehy;vided for them, some Care ought to be taken to turn their Industry to enter upon it: and therefore some gentle Restraints may be laid on those Manu&rehy;facturies which too much interfere with ours. And as the great danger we are to fear is from the cheap Labour of their Negroes, they ought to be entirely excluded from being imploy'd in any Manufacturies.</P>
<P>For no body will think it reasonable, when a Nation has spared her People to settle a Colony, that their Arts, Mysteries, and Skill in Manufacturies, should be transmitted to the Slaves of those Planters.</P>
<P>Therefore as they are only intended for Plant&rehy;ing and doing the Drudgery of the Plantations, they ought not to work at any sort of Iron-Manu&rehy;factury, further than making into Pigs; nor be admitted to weave, or comb, or spin any Wool, nor to spin or weave any Flax for Linen-Cloth; nor to work up, or be admitted to manufacture Hats, Stockings, or Leather.</P>
<P>And if after a certain time allowed for notice, any Negroe or Slave is found working at any of the aforesaid Manufacturies, 'tis proposed that <PB
N="36">his Master or Owner shall forfeit his Right and Title to him or them, and the said Negro or Negroes shall be transported out of all the Plantations on the Continent to some of the Sugar Islands, or to the <IT>Spanish</IT> Plantations, there to be sold, &horfill; &horfill; for the Benefit of the King, and &horfill; &horfill; for the Benefit of the Informer.</P>
<P>And there is reason to believe the Planters will be content to have their Negroes excluded from working at any of the aforesaid Manufacturies, provided they may imploy them in raising Flax and Hemp, making Iron, Boards, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> and be suf&rehy;ficiently encouraged to send them hither; and that they will consent to any further Regulation that may be thought necessary to prevent their inter&rehy;fering with the Manufacturies of <IT>Great Britain</IT>.</P>
<P>It is therefore proposed, That every Mas&rehy;ter-Weaver, Smith, or Comber, in the Planta&rehy;tions, shall be obliged to appear before the Go&rehy;vernour of each Province, there to register his Name and Place of Abode, and take a Licence, and pay for the Liberty of exercising his Trade, and to leave a faithful Account of the Number and Names of the Journeymen he employs: And every such Journeyman shall be obliged to appear before the Governour, and register his Name, and take out a Licence for working with such a Master, and shall pay for a Licence; which Licence shall con&rehy;tinue for one Year, and no longer; but if he changes his Master, he shall be obliged to change the Register of his Place of Abode to that of the Person he is going to reside with.</P>
<P>The Governour of each Province shall be oblig'd to transmit a faithful Account of the Number of Master-Smiths, Master-Weavers, Master-Combers, Number of Looms, and Number of Journeymen employed in each Manufactury: which Account shall be every Year transmitted to the Lords of <PB
N="37">Trade and Plantations, with an exact Account of all New-comers and of their last Place of Abode.</P>
<P>By this means the Lords of Trade will always have an Opportunity of seeing the Increase or Di&rehy;minution of the Manufacturies of the Colonies, which may be encouraged or depressed, according to their Wants, or the Danger of their too much interfering with us.</P>
<P>This Method will be far from destroying the I&rehy;ron-Works, or ruining the Proprietors of them, or from preventing the Husbandmen from get&rehy;ting their Plow-shares, Carts, or other Utensils, mended; or from destroying the Manufactury of Ship-Building, by depriving them of the Liberty of making Bolts, or Spikes, proper for carrying on that Work. And yet 'tis hoped it will more ef&rehy;fectually prevent the Increase of Manufacturies in the Colonies, than the severest Clause could do, by preferring to them Employments of so much greater value.</P>
<P>'Tis undoubtedly a great Detriment to the Trade of this Nation, to suffer Ships to sail from the Plantations to the <IT>Straits, &amp;c.</IT> and return again, without being obliged first to come home, and to clear out from hence for the Plantations.</P>
<P>For, notwithstanding the Laws against taking in any of the Manufactures or Merchandize of those Countries, Sailors and Super-Cargoes will break thro them; and when they receive Money, will invest part of it in some Commodity or other, to carry back with them; and they never want Opportunities of buying <IT>Italian</IT> Silks, <IT>French</IT> Silks, Stuffs and Druggets, <IT>Indian</IT> Silks and Callicoes, <IT>French, Dutch</IT>, and <IT>Hamburgh</IT> Linens: by which means the Money that should be brought to us, is laid out in foreign Countries.</P>
<PB N="38"><P>This irregular Navigation draws away more of our Sailors to settle in the Plantations, than any one Imployment that can be named.
</P><P>For abundance of West-Country Vessels that go to <IT>New-England</IT> to purchase Fish, make seve&rehy;ral Voyages without ever touching in <IT>Great Britain</IT>, it being entirely out of the way.</P>
<P>This Practice calls over the Wife to visit the Husband at <IT>New-England</IT>; and when they are to&rehy;gether, they soon become Inhabitants, and so we lose our People and Trade too.</P>
<P>Therefore to regulate this Trade, and render it equally advantageous both to <IT>Great Britain</IT> and the Plantations, it is proposed that all Ships belong&rehy;ing to the Plantations, who take in a Loading of Fish or Lumber for the <IT>Straits</IT>, shall be obliged, be&rehy;fore they return to the Plantations, to come to <IT>Great Britain</IT>, and bring the Produce of their Cargoes with them, and then clear out for the Plantations.</P>
<P>This Method will put both our and their Na&rehy;vigation upon an equal and just Foundation; and must satisfy those Gentlemen who were uneasy to see so many of our Seamen carried away into the Service of the Colonies.</P>
<P>I know it will be objected, that so many Ships being obliged to return to <IT>England</IT> from the <IT>Straits</IT>, many of them must come home empty, and con&rehy;sequently be a dead Loss to the Owners.</P>
<P>But if this Regulation is made in our Navi&rehy;gation, those Ships that discharge in <IT>Portugal, Spain, &amp;c.</IT> must come to <IT>Great Britain</IT> before they return to <IT>America</IT>; and may afford to take in a Loading at a smaller Freight than either the <IT>Dutch</IT> or <IT>Hamburghers</IT> can send their Ships thi&rehy;ther, and return; and consequently will become the common Carriers for them both: for the <IT>Dutch</IT> Merchants, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> study all frugal ways to render their Goods as cheap at Market as possible.</P>
<PB N="39"><P>The Navigation now carried on between the Plantations, <IT>Spain, Portugal</IT>, and the <IT>Straits</IT>, with&rehy;out coming for <IT>England</IT>, is for Fish, Timber, Boards, Pipe-Staves, and other Lumber; and be&rehy;cause of the Quickness of the Voyage, great Quantities are sold in those Countries, for which large Sums are remitted, and laid out to purchase Manufactures in <IT>England</IT>.
</P><P>But very few Plantation Certificate-Goods are sold there, because bulky Commodities will not bear the Charges of importing into <IT>Great Britain</IT>, of passing Debentures, and Re-shipping, and Freight, to the <IT>Straits</IT>, which cannot be less than 5 or 6<IT>s. per</IT> Hundred; which is in a manner a Pro&rehy;hibition upon Sugar, Tobacco, Rice, and all other bulky Commodities, the one half of which would be a great Profit to the Merchant.</P>
<P>Some Years since the Rice of <IT>Carolina</IT> was car&rehy;ried directly to <IT>Portugal, &amp;c.</IT> and great Quanti&rehy;ties were sold there; and so well approved, that it beat out the Rice of <IT>Verona</IT> and <IT>Egypt</IT> wherever it came; and large Remittances were made from thence to <IT>England</IT> for the Produce thereof.</P>
<P>But as soon as this Liberty was restrain'd, our Markets to <IT>Portugal, &amp;c.</IT> were lost, and the Plan&rehy;ters fell under such Discouragements, that they have not proceeded with the same Vigour in rai&rehy;sing Rice ever since; which is a very great Loss to the Manufacturers of this Kingdom: for all the Money which our Planters can raise, is sent here to buy them Clothing and Necessaries; so that <IT>England</IT> loses the selling of just so much in Manu&rehy;factures and Merchandize as is abated in the Quan&rehy;tity of Rice that might be exported to <IT>Portugal, &amp;c.</IT> For our People in the Colonies think it their happiness to be clothed with our Manufactures, and while there, to scrape up something to send home, that if possible they may return to <IT>Old England</IT>, <PB
N="40">their original Soil, and here, in Plenty and Ease, spend the Remains of Life.</P>
<P>Suppose we now send to <IT>Spain, Portugal, &amp;c.</IT> from all the Plantations, to the value of 100,000<IT>l.</IT> yearly in Fish, Lumber, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> and this Money is remitted to <IT>England</IT>, and laid out in our Woollen and other Manufactures, it is all Profit to us; but if the Merchant be debar'd this short Na&rehy;vigation, and be obliged to land them in <IT>England</IT>, and reship them, we should not send one twentieth part to the <IT>Straits, &amp;c.</IT> that we now do; which Loss would fall on the Manufactures, Product and Merchandize of <IT>England</IT>.</P>
<P>If those who sit at the Helm would be pleased to consider what Productions of the Plantation will bear bringing home, and reshipping to <IT>Spain, &amp;c.</IT> and what will not, they might, by their Pru&rehy;dence and Foresight, direct every Branch of the Plantation-Trade to be improved to a very great degree: And if <IT>Port-Mahon</IT> was made a free Port, bulky Commodities might be lodged there, when Markets did not answer, till there was a Demand for them, which would soon draw a considerable Trade thither; and would also be attended with so many Accommodations in favour of the Trade of <IT>Great Britain</IT>, that it deserves a proper time to explain, and set forth the Advantages thereof.</P>
<P><IT>Portugal, Spain</IT>, the <IT>Straits</IT>, and the <IT>Levant</IT>, consume a large part of the Commodities brought from <IT>America</IT>, and might be great Customers for the Products of the <IT>English</IT> Plantations, could they be carried directly to them upon an easy Freight; therefore all Goods that are not capable of Manu&rehy;factury, and cannot bear the Charge of bringing home and reshipping, might go directly to the <IT>Straits</IT>: which would greatly inlarge the Sales of our Plan&rehy;tation-Commodities, and draw hither the Silver and Gold of the <IT>Indies</IT>, without digging for it.</P>
<PB N="41"><P>I have carried this Letter to a much greater length than I at first intended, tho I have only touched on several things as necessary Hints to lead to further Inquiries: I have also omitted some things in which there is room for further Information. What I have writ has been at spare Minutes in the Intervals of Business: But I hope to find leisure to enlarge on some Particulars I have now touch'd upon, and also to treat further upon some Points in Trade, and the natural Advantages belonging to <IT>Great Britain</IT>, that may be greatly improv'd for the Benefit of the Pub&rehy;lick.

<P>&Iic;T has been alledged our Iron is made with Copps-Wood, and we should not have Con&rehy;sumption enough for it, were it not for Iron&rehy;Works.
</P><P>But I believe upon Enquiry, it will be found, that Copps-Wood is chiefly used in drawing Cast&rehy;Iron into Bar, which bears but a small Proportion of the Consumption of Wood to that of melting down the Oar into Cast-Iron.</P>
<P>But if the largest is used in Furnaces, it may certainly be used to more advantage in making Pig-Iron into Bar: and, as I have already observ'd, our Iron-Manufactury cannot be fully carried on, without about 20,000 Ton of foreign Iron added to what we make.</P>
<P>It will be greatly the Interest of this Kingdom to promote the Importation of Cast or Pig-Iron from the Plantations, by taking off all Duties, and allowing a small Bounty to encourage the Beginning of such an Undertaking (without which it is to be feared little Progress will be made in it) in order to be wrought into Bar&rehy;Iron here.</P>
<P>For I am informed, the same Quantity of Wood that will make as much Sow-Iron as is sufficient for one Ton of Bar-Iron, will make near four times the quantity of Pig into Bar-Iron; and the number of Poor employ'd in forging Iron into Bar, will be abundantly more than can work at Furnaces.</P>
<P>Supposing, for Argument, our Copps-Wood now makes 8000 Ton of Iron from the Oar into <PB
N="43">Cast-Iron, and from Cast into Bar, the same Quanti&rehy;ty may make 30,000 Tun out of Pig into Bar-Iron; and if that Quantity is not enough for Home-Con&rehy;sumption, it may be enlarged to 40 or 50,000 Tun, without breaking in upon our Timber.</P>
<P>For if we have Cast-Iron from the Plantations, any Part of the Kingdom, to which there is Water&rehy;Carriage, and Wood and Water convenient for erec&rehy;ting Forges, may have the same opportunity of making Pig into Bar-Iron, as those already erected. And there are very few Counties in the Kingdom but have the Conveniency of navigable Rivers or Water-Carriage to them, and may, if Gentle&rehy;men please, partake of the Advantages, as well as those Counties that have Iron-Oar and Fur&rehy;naces among them.</P>
<P>And as several Gentlemen are desirous to en&rehy;courage the Importation of Pig-Iron, and not Bar, from our own Plantations, fearing it might inter&rehy;fere with the Bar-Iron made here; yet the Bar&rehy;Manufactury may <CORR
SIC="becarried">be carried</CORR> on to the great Ad&rehy;vantage of those Gentlemen of this Kingdom, who are willing to be concerned in Iron-Works in the Plantations, without any manner of De&rehy;pendency on <IT>Great Britain</IT> for a Market.</P>
<P>For if Bar-Iron was brought home from the Plantations, and lodged in the King's Ware-House, till sent to a foreign Market; or carry'd directly to <IT>Portugal, Spain</IT>, and the <IT>Straits</IT>, as we do Lumber, Fish, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> we should find Markets enough for all that will be made, the Value of which would be sent us home in Gold or Silver.</P>
