<HEAD><RO>The PREFACE to the Reader</RO>.</HEAD>
<P>&Dic;Esigning to Publish these <RO>Papers</RO>, on a Subject in which every one is now, or will hereafter be <RO>Concern'd</RO>, I addresst to the <RO>Evening Meeting</RO> at the <RO>College</RO>, after they had given their <RO>Advice</RO> to a large <RO>Confluence</RO> of <RO>Patients</RO>, for a more <RO>particular Information</RO>, having lately met with some <RO>Reflections</RO> on the <RO>Dispen&rehy;sary</RO>. They gave me the <RO>Reasons</RO>, which mov'd them to make the first <RO>Subscription</RO> to their <RO>Repository</RO> of <RO>Medicines</RO>.</P>
<P><RO>1.</RO> That the <RO>Apothecaries</RO> had often Reproach the <RO>Physicians</RO>, that the <RO>Poor</RO> were left to their Care, and that they neglected the <RO>Phar&rehy;maceutic Part</RO>, or the <RO>Preparations</RO> of <RO>Remedies</RO>, which was now <RO>lodg'd</RO> in themselves.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd that the <RO>Dispensary</RO> is the greatest <RO>Relief</RO> to the <RO>Poor</RO>, who have the <RO>best advice</RO>, and the <RO>best Physick</RO> at a very <RO>small Expence</RO>.</P>
<P>The <RO>Physicians</RO> are frequently considering the Drugs, and as care&rehy;fully viewing the common Preparations, improving them, and ad&rehy;ding others, which they judge more useful to the various <RO>intentions</RO> of <RO>their</RO> Art.</P>
<P><RO>2.</RO> The <RO>Citizens</RO> very often <RO>Complain</RO> to their <RO>Physicians</RO> of the very chargeable Bills of the <RO>Apotheca&rehy;ries</RO>, and declare their <RO>Jealousie</RO> of a <RO>Combination</RO> in the multiplying <RO>Medicines</RO>, and <RO>Doses</RO>, beyond the <RO>Exigence</RO> of the <RO>Disease</RO>.</P>
<P>The <RO>Dispensary</RO> gives <RO>releif</RO> to the <RO>First</RO>, by affording theirs almost at the First <RO>Cost, 15</RO> or 18 in <RO>20 Cheaper</RO> than they are paid for in the <RO>Bill</RO>, at <RO>Christmas</RO>. And the <RO>Dispensary Physicians</RO> being under no <RO>Engagements</RO> with the <RO>Apothecaries</RO>, Cure their <RO>Patients</RO> with One, or a few <RO>Prescriptions</RO>, in less <RO>difficult Disorders</RO>: with no more, than are <RO>necessary</RO> in the more <RO>dangerous Distempers</RO>, carefully <RO>avoiding</RO> (all <RO>Me&rehy;dicines</RO> acting on <RO>Nature</RO> with more or less <RO>violence)</RO> the more <RO>hazardous Extreme</RO>. The Charge is under 10 or 20 <RO>Shillings</RO> in a <RO>Feaver</RO> or <RO>Small Pox</RO>, instead of so many <RO>Pounds</RO>. Ma&rehy;ny others require not <RO>Physick</RO> of more than Three or Four <RO>Shil&rehy;lings</RO>, which by the <RO>Craft</RO> of subdividing into <RO>Boles</RO>, and <RO>Pow&rehy;ders</RO>, and <RO>Draughts</RO> are in the Sum <RO>total</RO> of a <RO>Bill</RO> Four or Five <RO>Pounds</RO>, the <RO>Rates</RO> to be supported by the very hard Names, with which they are Dignify'd for this purpose.</P>
<PB N="[iii]"><P><RO>3.</RO> The Third <RO>Reason</RO> respects the <RO>Physicians</RO>. They have been many Years under the <RO>dread</RO> of the <RO>Apothecaries</RO> power, who <RO>avowedly</RO> own, they <RO>Command</RO> in all the <RO>Families</RO>, and can bring in, or turn out, whom they please. They observe, they <RO>Go&rehy;vern</RO> as a <RO>Tyrant</RO> his <RO>Subjects</RO>, make them <RO>obedient</RO> by the grievous <RO>Taxes</RO> they are forc't to Pay. The <RO>People</RO> from the exorbitant Payments to them, dare not consult a <RO>Physician</RO>, un&rehy;less at the last extremity of a Disease.
</P><P>The <RO>Physicians</RO> would govern their <RO>Pa&rehy;tients</RO>, only by their own <RO>Reason</RO>. They have the <RO>Liberty</RO> of having very cheap <RO>Physick</RO>, instead of very dear, and consulting them at the <RO>beginning</RO> of a <RO>Distemper</RO>, secure from an <RO>Expence</RO> which shall at any time surprize.</P>
<P>They would prevent their own <RO>Ruine</RO>, chiefly from their <RO>best Success</RO>. This has been hitherto the <RO>Case</RO> of the <RO>Faculty</RO>. If they Conquered a <RO>Distemper</RO>, the <RO>Remedy</RO> (tho' not the <RO>manner</RO> of using it) becomes the <RO>Apothecaries <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Nostrum</FOREIGN></RO>, to be Sold out to every one, and their Successors: And the <RO>Doctor</RO> left at leisure to invent more, to remain with him during the Cure of one <RO>Patient</RO>, like the <RO>Ephemera</RO>, which lives but one <RO>Day</RO>.</P>
<P>Thus the <RO>Dispensary</RO> complies with the Two <RO>Proposals</RO> of the <RO>Apothecaries</RO>, removes the <RO>Peoples Complaints</RO> and <RO>Jealousy</RO> of a <RO>Cheat</RO> put on them by all <RO>Physicians</RO>, and gives the license to him of using his own <RO>Method</RO> and <RO>Prescript</RO>, to his <RO>Patients</RO> advantage and his <RO>own</RO>.</P>
<P>The <RO>Apothecary</RO> cannot with any ingenuity <RO>complain</RO>, that he is <RO>injured</RO>. For as he seizes on the <RO>Advising</RO> part, as a <RO>Depen&rehy;dency</RO>, he would annex to the <RO>Shop Trade</RO>: The other from the <RO>Example</RO> brings them both together to the better Service of the <RO>Publick</RO>. If the <RO>Apothecary</RO> proves an <RO>Ambodexter</RO>, feels the <RO>Pulse</RO> with one <RO>Hand</RO>, and makes <RO>Medicines</RO> with the other; Why may not the <RO>College</RO> please the <RO>People</RO> with the same <RO>Dexteri&rehy;ty?</RO> Unless (which is reasonable, where <RO>Health</RO> and <RO>Life</RO> are ta&rehy;ken care of) the <RO>Apothecary</RO> will wholly Practice the <RO>Judicial</RO> part, and leave the <RO>Ministerial</RO> of making <RO>Medicines</RO> to the <RO>Phy&rehy;sician</RO>.</P>
<P>But I have heard the <RO>Dispensary</RO> impeacht with the <RO>barba&rehy;rous Design</RO> of destroying the <RO>Apothecaries Company</RO>. They <RO>Scorn</RO> the ridiculous <RO>Imputation</RO>, and declare the greatest <RO>Esteem</RO> of those of that <RO>Society</RO>, who, like the <RO>Gentleman</RO> near the <RO>Col&rehy;lege, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Moribus antiquis</FOREIGN></RO>, are as Eminent for their Care in pre&rehy;paring the best <RO>Medicines</RO>, as their <RO>Integrity</RO> and <RO>Modesty</RO> in not invading the <RO>Profession</RO>, or <RO>abusing</RO> and <RO>destroying</RO> the <RO>People</RO>. <PB
N="[iv]">The <RO>Apothecaries</RO> destroy themselves by their <RO>Numbers</RO>, multi&rehy;plying from a <RO>Thousand</RO> to as many more in the space of Eight <RO>Years</RO>, without any Prospect of checking the superfluous <RO>Increase</RO>.</P>
<P>They must therefore <RO>accuse</RO> the <RO>unhappy Conduct</RO> of their <RO>Com&rehy;pany</RO>, who would not foresee, and are now <RO>insensible</RO> of its fatal <RO>Consequences</RO>.</P>
<P>They <RO>avow</RO> with assurance, that they have or will take the <RO>Practice</RO> of <RO>Physick</RO> into their own Hands, only reserve Five or Six <RO>Great Men</RO>, to take on themselves the <RO>Odium</RO> of the <RO>Deaths</RO> of their <RO>Custo&rehy;mers</RO>. The <RO>Surgeons</RO> fare not better than the <RO>Faculty</RO>, They are re&rehy;serv'd for the <RO>Difficult</RO> Cases, are rob'd of all the more common; by success in which, they can only acquire <RO>Skill</RO> and <RO>Dexterity</RO> for the more <RO>Important</RO>. The <RO>Poor</RO> are <RO>undone</RO> in every <RO>Sickness</RO>, and <RO>de&rehy;stroyed</RO> in the <RO>subsequent</RO>, deter'd from applying to any <RO>Relief</RO>. The <RO>Dispensary</RO> pretends to <RO>preserve</RO> those, who are at present more <RO>numerous</RO> than the <RO>Apothecaries</RO>.</P>
<P>It will be the <RO><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Alma Mater</FOREIGN></RO> to the <RO>Physicians</RO> from the Two <RO>Uni&rehy;versities</RO>: who will be able to <RO>Exercise</RO> the <RO>Learning</RO> they had acquir'd there.</P>
<P>The other <RO>Objection</RO> I have often heard from the more <RO>unobserving</RO> People, or whose <RO>Memory</RO> may not serve them well, that the <RO>Apothe&rehy;caries</RO> sell us Cheap. It's granted, if they <RO>will</RO>. But do not they by their own and the <RO>Doctor's Artifices</RO> in <RO>dividing</RO>, sell an <RO>Electuary</RO> of <RO>12 Pence</RO> (the most <RO>Cordial</RO> and most us'd in <RO>Feavers)</RO> in <RO>Boles</RO> for <RO>12 Half Crowns</RO>: A <RO>Julep</RO> of the same <RO>Value</RO>, put into little Glasses, for almost as much. A <RO>bitter</RO> or other <RO>Decoction</RO>, which may be Boyl'd at Home in <RO>Silver</RO>, or <RO>cleaner Vessels</RO>, then in the <RO>Shop</RO>, of Two or Three <RO>Pence</RO>, brought in little <RO>Doses</RO>, at <RO>10</RO> or <RO>12 Shillings</RO>. We will not <RO>quarrel</RO> their <RO>11 Pence</RO> in the <RO>Shilling Profit</RO>, would only prevent the <RO>return</RO> of it 40 times in 24 Hours many days following, when the <RO>Patients advantage</RO> is the least part of the <RO>Design</RO> of the <RO>mincing</RO> and <RO>subdividing</RO>.</P>
<P>The Last and Vilest <RO>Objection</RO> is, that the subscribers to the <RO>Dis&rehy;pensary</RO> are not as Eminent, as the <RO>Physicians</RO> their <RO>Favourites</RO>. It's own'd they can make <RO>Famous</RO> or <RO>Infamous</RO>, by a few <RO>Cabals and Visits</RO> in all Quarters of the <RO>Town</RO>. But is there any part of <RO>Physick</RO>, even Poetry, which these <RO>Gentlemen</RO> cannot pretend to, as well as the <RO>other</RO>, who <RO>distrust</RO> their own <RO>Merit</RO>, by courting their <RO>Favour</RO>, and putting themselves into their <RO>Service;</RO> and plying them, as <RO>Porters</RO> a Shop of the larger <RO>Business</RO>.</P>
<P>I could not, till after a long <RO>Discourse</RO>, penetrate into the more <RO>abstruse</RO> and <RO>secret design</RO> of the <RO>Dispensary</RO>. 'Twas own'd at last by those <PB
N="[v]">the most proper <RO>Judges</RO>, that the <RO>People</RO> in the more common and usu&rehy;al <RO>Illnesses</RO>, recover easily by the <RO>Strength</RO> of <RO>Nature</RO>, or one or two proper <RO>Directions</RO>. In these a <RO>great</RO>, but <RO>useless Expence</RO> must pay the <RO>Attendance</RO> of the <RO>Apothecary</RO>, who has no <RO>gratuity</RO> given him but must satisfy himself by the <RO>number</RO> of <RO>things</RO>, he can prevail on the Sick to <SIC>t&aelig;ke</SIC>.</P>
<P>In the other <RO>Diseases</RO> with Danger, when <RO>Nature</RO> is <RO>weak</RO> or <RO>ra&rehy;ging</RO> and has only one <RO>Crisis</RO> (of its own <RO>choosing</RO> chiefly) by which it can be sav'd; and many <RO>hot</RO> or <RO>cooling Doses</RO>, unhappily given, or diverting the <RO>Crisis</RO> by one tampering, brings certain <RO>Destruction</RO>. By this <RO>unfortunate</RO>, but <RO>in vogue management</RO>, 'twas asserted, that the far greater <RO>Numbers</RO> are <RO>Kill'd</RO> and <RO>Destroy'd</RO> by <RO>Physick</RO>, who would undisturb'd have surely recover'd without Any.</P>
<P>The <RO>Dispensary <CORR SIC="Practiee">Practice</CORR></RO> will in a little time demonstrate, that the <RO>Remedy</RO> to this <RO>Pernicious Practice</RO> can be only had from it self, secure from the Infection of this Inhumane Craft of growing Rich. Others therefore, who resolve to continue in the <RO>Old Mode</RO> and <RO>Fa&rehy;shion</RO>, and will have the <RO>Apothecary</RO> to please himself in the <RO>Price</RO> and <RO>Number</RO> of the <RO>Medicines</RO> they take, need not express any <RO>Re&rehy;sentment</RO> to the <RO>Dispensary</RO>, which only proposes a <RO>Method</RO> in all respects more Commodious for them.</P>
<P>They may expect that this will be Debated between the <RO>Physi&rehy;cians</RO> of the <RO>Apothecaries</RO> Party and the <RO>Peoples</RO>, the one Side re&rehy;lying on the receiv'd <RO>Maxim, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">si Populus decipi vult, decipia&rehy;tur</FOREIGN></RO>, the other, on the <RO>Magna Charta</RO> of all <RO>Communities</RO>, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Salus Populi Suprema Lex esto</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>When it shall become <RO>Sensible</RO>, how much the <RO>Publick</RO> is im&rehy;pos'd on in the <RO>Expence</RO> in <RO>Sickness</RO> and in <RO>Life</RO> it self. The Laws which now Punish <RO>Offenders</RO>, who by <RO>Support</RO> or <RO>Discipline</RO> might have been diverted, will at last interpose the <RO>Cure</RO> of more <RO>Latent</RO>, and more <RO>enormous Crimes</RO>. The <RO>Faculty</RO> will have the <RO>Protection</RO> it Demands, after the performance of its Part, of all the <RO>stipulated Conditions</RO>. The <RO>Dispensary</RO> will have the <RO>publick regard</RO>, or observe its <RO>Enemies</RO> some times Punished with <RO>Fines</RO>, more than the <RO>Hundred Marks</RO>, or the other more <RO>Severe</RO>, the loss of <RO>Life</RO>, from <RO>Medicines</RO> in the exorbitant <RO>Quantity</RO>, as destructive as <RO>Poyson</RO>.</P>

<HEAD><IT>A Letter from a Merchant in</IT> London, to a Dispensary Physician.</HEAD>
<SALUTE><IT>SIR</IT>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic; reflected often after my discovery from my Feaver on the method reviv'd by the <IT>Dispensary Physicians</IT>, of treating their <IT>Patients</IT> with a <IT>few Medicines</IT> (not almost hourly every day, as is the present mode of the Town) but as you observe the effect of the <IT>last</IT>, and the apparent exigence of the <IT>Disease</IT>. This <IT>Caution</IT> gave me a greater <IT>confidence</IT> in your <IT>Art</IT>, and was improv'd by the assurance I had of the Medicines being faithfully prepar'd and dis&rehy;penc't at the <IT>College</IT>: the expence of which was less during my confinement, than I have had formerly exacted in one day. How often have I thought of the strict command you gave, that I should after my <IT>restless nights</IT>, remain <IT>undisturb'd</IT> till almost <IT>Noon</IT>, and of the repose and refreshment I never fail'd of during the morning. You demanded the <IT>first view</IT> of me, before I was rufled by any <IT>intrusion</IT>, especially by those who from a groundless pretence to skill disturb by <IT>vain enquiries</IT>, or terrifie by random <IT>Prognosticks</IT>, the entertain&rehy;ment for the mind during the inquietude of the night following.
</P><P>When you allow'd me to sit up and receive my Friends, I had one day the conversation of my Relations, who had consulted you, They entertain'd me with this new <IT>Revolu&rehy;tion</IT> in Physick, and the generous design of the <IT>Dispensary</IT>, with which they declar'd themselves extremely satisfy'd. They told me that this <IT>Contest</IT> between the <IT>Honest Physicians</IT> of the Dispensary (thus it seems you are distinguisht, tho the word has lately lost its <IT>value</IT>) and the <IT>Apothecaries</IT> on the o&rehy;ther side, supported by their <IT>Confederates</IT> the <IT>Anti-College Phy&rehy;sicians</IT>, was as much the common Discourse abroad, as the <PB
N="2">difference of the two <IT>Companies</IT>, the <IT>Bank</IT> and their <IT>Antago&rehy;nists</IT>, or the great Factions, which divide the Nation. 'Twas not very easie to us, to find out, upon what reasons and pre&rehy;tences this <IT>Controversy</IT> began, and is now carried on with so much <IT>heat</IT> and <IT>animosity</IT>.</P>
<P>But we, who had been advis'd by you, and has us'd the College Remedies, could more easily discover the true causes of this <IT>Separation</IT>, than the <IT>Citizens</IT>, who yet ly under great <IT>Errours</IT> and <IT>Prejudices</IT> in this <IT>Affair</IT>.</P>
<P>The case I presume (and it was the Opinion of the whole Company) may be stated in these few particulars.</P>
<P>That the <IT>Honest Physician</IT> is oblig'd by the Trust repos'd in him by his <IT>Patient</IT>, and his <IT>Interest</IT> in the <IT>Success</IT>, to take <IT>Care</IT>, that the Medicines are <IT>effectual</IT> and <IT>Dispenc't</IT> with the utmost <IT>Fidelity</IT>. For if the Instruments he uses are not good, the effect of his Advice is lost, and by a mistake in <IT>Weight</IT> or <IT>Measure</IT> the Life of the Patient destroy'd.</P>
<P>The <IT>Apothecary</IT> neglects his <IT>duty</IT> to the <IT>Physician</IT> and the <IT>Sick</IT>: Is rarely in his <IT>Shop</IT>, prepars few <IT>Medicines</IT>, but buys them abroad under great uncertainties, and trusts raw un&rehy;experienc'd <IT>Apprentices</IT> to select the <IT>Ingredients</IT> and measure the <IT>Proportion</IT> in the <IT>Prescript</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>people</IT>, who are not acquainted with the Dispensary, of two <IT>Evils</IT>, as <corr sic="thy">they</corr> think, choose the least. They believe, that, by using the <IT>Apothecary</IT>, they save the <IT>Physicians Fee</IT>, tho the Medicines excessively rated, and brought in little parcels to be taken often, rise to a greater sum, (by three in four in most cases) than both the <IT>Advice</IT> and <IT>Physick</IT> necessary in most <IT>Distempers</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Associate Party</IT> of the <IT>College</IT> often feeling the Apo&rehy;thecaries power in the Families, readily come in, or are for&rehy;ced to serve under them, on condition they forward with all their Arts the <IT>Increase</IT> of the <IT>Bill</IT>, and raise their <IT>Ability</IT> to advise to an equal pitch with their own: By both which the Apothecaries Interest is more confirm'd and improv'd.</P>
<P>Your <IT>Design</IT> therefore is, to revive the former <IT>Pra&rehy;ctice</IT> of <IT>Physick</IT>, particularly that of Dr. <IT>Lower</IT> and Dr. <IT>Sy&rehy;denham</IT>, who had much greater success with <IT>fewer Remedies</IT>, then are now upon these different projects <IT>forc'd</IT> upon the people: or rather to expose to publick view, the <IT>methods</IT>, <PB
N="3">the <IT>Physicians</IT> at this time and the <IT>Apothecaries</IT>, use to <IT>them&rehy;selves</IT> and <IT>Friends</IT>, of avoiding carefully the excess, by which the most <IT>innocent</IT> things, when <IT>Nature</IT> is disorder'd, become <IT>destructive</IT>.</P>
<P>You design to convince the <IT>People</IT> by their experience, that the most useful and <IT>effectual</IT> remedies are of no great <IT>price</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Publick</IT> will soon become sensible that the <IT>Expence</IT> in almost all <IT>Diseases</IT> of each day will be of one, two, or three Shillings, instead of so many <IT>pounds</IT>, at the usual rates of the modern management, and that their <IT>Distempers</IT> will sooner yeild to a few well prepar'd College Medicines, than to the common decay'd, vitious, and adulterate of the Shops, and that the <IT>Physician's</IT> Reward and the Expence of what he advises, comes far short of the <IT>Sum Total</IT> of a <IT>long Bill</IT>.</P>
<P>Your <IT>Dispensary</IT> therefore cannot fail of the Universal ap&rehy;probation, especially when the <IT>people</IT> shall reflect, that in many cases they have us'd themselves, the <IT>method</IT> you re&rehy;commend: preparing in their Houses the <IT>white Decoction, purging Infusions</IT> of <IT>Rhubarb</IT>, and <IT>Sena</IT>: or using the com&rehy;mon <IT>Cordial Waters, Spirits</IT> and <IT>Tinctures</IT>, bought of the <IT>Druggist, Chymist</IT>, or <IT>Whole-sale-Shop</IT>.</P>
<P>But when its use shall become more <IT>publick</IT>, your generous <IT>Charity</IT> and regard to <IT>Mankind</IT>, will be loudly applauded; and the advantage from it to this City allowed to be of great&rehy;er extent, than all the <IT>Royal</IT> and munificent <IT>Hospitals</IT> in <IT>Europe</IT>.</P>
<P>We could take this <IT>short view</IT> of the present and the fu&rehy;ture state of <IT>Physick</IT> (which is obvious to every one, who will consider his own Interest, or not be very unwilling to be inform'd) but because it is an <IT>Affair</IT> of the greatest concern of our Life. Your Friends oblig'd me to consult you, and report to them your Opinion of the greivous <IT>Distemper</IT> and the <DEL

REND="it" LANG="LAT">Postulatum</FOREIGN>, which no reasonable Person can refuse to <IT>allow</IT>, that the Zeal and Concern the <IT>Dispensary Physicians</IT> express to relieve<PB
N="3"> <PB N="4">the Publick, ought not to be less, than is justly expected by every particular, when he commits his Health and Life to the Care and Integrity of his <IT>Physician</IT>.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my memory has not retain'd the whole, your information consisting of so many parts: But these have made on me too great an Impression, to be easily for&rehy;gotten.</P>
<P>That we are more <IT>impos'd</IT> on, than any other <IT>Nation</IT> in the <IT>World</IT>, in all the <IT>Arts</IT>, which relate to <IT>Health</IT> and <IT>Life</IT>.</P>
<P>That the common and most useful <IT>Remedies</IT> are put on the people at a rate in the most fifty times, in many other one <IT>hundred times</IT> more, then their <IT>intrinsick</IT> value.</P>
<P>That the exorbitant <IT>Expense</IT> ruines the <IT>Poor</IT>, deters them and the <IT>Wealthy</IT> from a just care of their <IT>Health</IT>, to avoid the oppressive <IT>treatment</IT> in subsequent <IT>Diseases</IT>.</P>
<P>That to <IT>hide</IT> these <IT>Exactions</IT> from the people, the <IT>Apo&rehy;thecaries</IT> allow none to practice with them, but those <IT>Physi&rehy;cians</IT> who betray their <IT>Profession</IT>, countenance the use of a <IT>vast quantity</IT> of Physick, destructive to <IT>Health</IT>, and support the exorbitant rates in the <IT>Bill</IT>.</P>
<P>That the <IT>Physicians</IT> are by them brought into all the Fa&rehy;milies, even those, in which the <IT>Publick</IT> is greatly concern'd, whose most distinguishing <IT>Character</IT> is taken from their <IT>Zeal</IT> to <IT>serve</IT> their <IT>Interest</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Writing well</IT> is the Language for writing a very <IT>long Pre&rehy;scription</IT>; so much of it is for the <IT>Patient</IT>, the larger part is the <IT>Bribe</IT> or gratuity to these <IT>New Solicitors</IT>, who cannot fail; when they assume the power to govern and command (in the <IT>Physick business</IT>) all their <IT>Customers</IT>.</P>
<P>The esteem of the <IT>Profession</IT> is sunk by the Scandal of all the <IT>Deaths</IT> in the Town thrown on the <IT>Physicians</IT>, who are rarely consulted, but when the <IT>Case</IT> is made <IT>desperate</IT> by the <IT>Apothecary</IT>. The <IT>Patient</IT> therefore takes the <IT>Prognostick</IT> of Death from the change of <IT>Advice</IT>, and is depriv'd of that <IT>Assurance</IT>, which is the greatest <IT>support</IT> in <IT>Sickness</IT>, as in <IT>War</IT>, from the opinion of the <IT>Generals</IT> Conduct from former Success, and in all other the greatest <IT>Affairs</IT>.</P>
<PB N="5"><P>That the <IT>Study</IT> of the <IT>Art</IT> is <IT>neglected</IT>, because the <IT>Di&rehy;seases</IT> are by ill treatment forc'd into <IT>unnatural Symptomes</IT>, and to differ from all these, your <IT>Authors</IT> treat of. There are in all the <IT>Books</IT> of <IT>Physick</IT> no <IT>Cases</IT> of <IT>Distempers</IT> manag'd by an <IT>Apothecary</IT>, by almost one common random method, your <IT>Writers</IT> having been careful in this particular to <IT>conceal</IT> the <IT>Infamy</IT> of the <IT>People</IT> and <IT>your Profession</IT>.
</P><P>You perceiv'd my <IT>Surprize</IT>, and <IT>prevented</IT> my <IT>Reflection</IT> on the <IT>College</IT>, that they had not long since interpos'd to <IT>prevent</IT> the <IT>ruine</IT> of the <IT>People</IT> and <IT>themselves</IT>, by presenting me with the <IT>Papers</IT> publish'd by the <IT>President</IT> and <IT>Censors</IT>, and that lately concerning the <IT>Dispensary</IT>, subscrib'd by more than forty of the first <IT>Contributors</IT>. You pointed to me the <IT>Para&rehy;graphs</IT> which justifie, and support all the <IT>Articles</IT> of <IT>Impeach&rehy;ment</IT>. The account of the erection of the <IT>Dispensary</IT> at the desire of the <IT>City</IT> must silence even the <IT>Apothecaries</IT>, as well as the unwary <IT>Opposers</IT>, whose <IT>interest</IT> is procur'd by it. I observ'd its now almost <IT>ten years</IT> since, that a <IT>Committee</IT> of the <IT>Honest</IT> part of the <IT>College</IT> had expos'd these <IT>Grievances</IT> to the <IT>Lord Mayor</IT> and <IT>Court</IT> of <IT>Aldermen</IT>, and had afterward at seve&rehy;ral times convinc'd them of the necessity of removing the <IT>op&rehy;pression</IT> the <IT>Publick</IT> had long felt and complain'd of. It was concluded, that the <IT>Physicians</IT> should <IT>rate</IT> the <IT>price</IT> of the Medicines in his <IT>Prescription</IT>. This was haughtily rejected by the <IT>Company</IT>. At the meeting in their <IT>Hall</IT> some months af&rehy;ter, a small number of the <IT>younger Apothecaries</IT> offering to comply with it, were compell'd with <IT>Threats</IT> of the <IT>worst</IT> usage in their <IT>Society</IT>, to retract and withdraw their pro&rehy;mise. The <IT>Committee</IT> of the <IT>Aldermen</IT> and <IT>Commons</IT> propo&rehy;sed: (the <IT>Apothecary</IT> thus flying of from that as <IT>necessary</IT> as <IT>reasonable Proposal</IT>) That the <IT>College</IT> would provide a <IT>Reposi&rehy;tory</IT> of <IT>Medicines</IT>, which will have and may justly claim (especially after twenty thousand Bills made up there) their <IT>Regard</IT> and <IT>Protection</IT>.</P>
<P>The Governours of our <IT>Hospitals</IT>, who give their <IT>charity</IT> in directing the <IT>charity</IT> of the <IT>Founders</IT> in their <IT>respective Houses</IT>, where the health of some <IT>Hundreds</IT> is provided for, cannot observe the calamities of many <IT>Thousands</IT> with&rehy;out concern, and their <IT>Endeavour</IT> to promote their <IT>relief</IT>. Must we not conclude our selves <IT>Parties</IT> and <IT>Accessaries</IT> to <PB
N="6">the ruine of the <IT>Poor</IT>, who beside the <IT>pain</IT> and <IT>dread</IT> of the <IT>event</IT> of the <IT>Disease</IT>, are under the fear of <IT>spending</IT> their whole <IT>Substance</IT>, in one sickness, and being absolutely un&rehy;done? They are often <IT>releast</IT> from the <IT>Distemper</IT> by the strength of <IT>Nature</IT> and their <IT>Constitution</IT>, and under the fear of Arrests or in Prison for a Bill of the then <IT>useless Physick</IT> above their <IT>Ability</IT> to <IT>discharge</IT>. The condition of the <IT>Wealthy</IT> is equally piteable, and as much wants redress. The Ship cast on the Shoar is fill'd not with design to <IT>save</IT> but <IT>plunder</IT>: More Art shewen to raise the <IT>Bill</IT>, than to <IT>re&rehy;cover</IT> the <IT>sick Person.

<P>The <IT>Laws</IT> of the last <IT>Age</IT> foresaw and provided against these <IT>vile abuses</IT>, but our Laws are subject to the same <IT>Dis&rehy;eases</IT> with our selves, or are falln into the <IT>Infirmity</IT> of old Age, to be <IT>regardless</IT> of others concerns, as they are neg&rehy;lected by them.

<P>I suggested to you, and you allow'd it, that the Faculty could not want the Art of relieving it self: but you re&rehy;minded me, that one Party turns its <IT>Force</IT> against the <IT>other</IT>, and like a vitious <IT>Composition</IT> of <IT>Ingredients</IT> of <IT>opposite quali&rehy;ties</IT>, had no Power or Vertue to subdue the <IT>Epidemick Ma&rehy;lignity</IT>.</P>
<P>Its allow'd, that from one Absurdity admitted, many others inevitably follow, as one Cause produces many Effects.</P>
<P>The great Increase of <IT>Apothecaries</IT> is evidently the cause of all the present <IT>Grievances</IT> to the <IT>Profession</IT> of <IT>Physick</IT>, to <IT>Themselves</IT> and the <IT>People</IT>.</P>
<P>They are become one <IT>Thousand</IT>, including the <IT>Partners</IT>, more then ten to one <IT>Physician</IT>. The regulated Cities abroad allow no more, then can readily make up the <IT>Physicians</IT> Di&rehy;rections, in the other proportion of one to ten.</P>
<PB N="7"><P>The consequence of so great and disproportionate a num&rehy;ber is not to be avoided, that <IT>nine Hundred</IT> of them cannot possibly keep good Medicines in their <IT>Shops</IT>. For most of the <IT>Compositions</IT>, and many of the Simples often <IT>mov'd</IT> in little <IT>quantities</IT>, are subject to <IT>evaporate</IT> their most active parts, to corrupt in a little time, and become <IT>vappid</IT>, or <IT>sour</IT>, or <IT>rotten</IT> and <IT>stinking</IT>. Who will believe, that the <IT>simple Waters, Tinctures, Spirits, Powders</IT> of <IT>volatile parts, Sy&rehy;rups, Electuaries</IT>, &amp;c. can <IT>wait</IT> and keep well, till they have their turn to be us'd, when the Shops are as numerous as the <IT>Sick</IT>. There must be a <IT>quick vent</IT> and <IT>expence</IT> and <IT>use</IT> of all <IT>perishable</IT> wares.

</P><P>This the <IT>Gentlemen</IT> soon observe in a Tavern, where the <IT>Draught</IT> is not <IT>great</IT> for want of <IT>Customers</IT>: and the <IT>Ladies</IT> see much <IT>antiquated Ware</IT> in the <IT>Mercers</IT> Shop not <IT>often visited</IT>.</P>
<P>Their number obliges 'em in imitation of <IT>Hawkers</IT>, to be always visiting the Families to recommend the <IT>taking</IT> Trade in all the easiest <IT>Cases</IT>, and in other cases to <IT>quicken</IT> the use of the <IT>Boles</IT> and <IT>Draughts</IT>. They are rarely seen attending the business of the <IT>Shop</IT>. The <IT>Prescript</IT> of the <IT>Doctor</IT> and <IT>Apothecary</IT> himself is left to be made up by the <IT>raw heedless Boy</IT>, not presumed yet to have Discretion equal to his <IT>Ma&rehy;ster</IT>, whose utmost care is <IT>required</IT> and <IT>depended</IT> on, where the <IT>Patients Life</IT> is <IT>lost</IT> by almost every mistake.

<P>The honest <IT>Apothecaries</IT> lament the difficulties which by the exorbitant numbers are brought on the <IT>People</IT> and <IT>Themselves</IT>: That their <IT>Medicines</IT> cannot be <IT>vented</IT> while they are <IT>good</IT> and fit for use.</P>
<PB N="8"><P>That the <IT>Scent, Palate, Stomach</IT> of the <IT>Sick</IT> must condemn the corrupted <IT>stinking</IT> Dose, before he can lay it aside.

<P>That to <IT>live themselves</IT> they must <IT>endanger</IT> the <IT>Life</IT> of their Customer, and give oftentimes more than they would use <IT>themselves</IT> under the same <IT>Circumstance</IT>.

<PB N="9"><P>'Tis obvious, the prodigious <IT>number</IT> of <IT>Apothecaries</IT>, who in a few years will naturally increase of more than twice as many, and so forward in a double <IT>proportion</IT>, will necessa&rehy;rily oblige them to improve the greater vent of <IT>Physick</IT>, and the <IT>higher prizes</IT>.

<P>When I went abroad to return the <IT>Visits</IT> to my <IT>Friends</IT>, and was recommending the <IT>Advantages</IT> of the <IT>Dispensary</IT>, and the <IT>Integrity</IT> of the <IT>Physicians</IT>, who are the <IT>subscribers</IT> to it, you will not easily imagine, how <IT>suprising</IT> it was to me, that many express'd a <IT>Prejudice</IT> to it, without desiring to <IT>understand</IT> the <IT>design</IT> of it. A notable <IT>Company</IT> round a <IT>Tea-table</IT>, had been <IT>exclaming</IT>, I perceiv'd, a great while against it, and concluded, that they'd go the <IT>old way</IT>, and expect till it came more in <IT>Fashion</IT>.

<PB N="11"><P>In the other <IT>visits</IT>, I made that day, I was <IT>startled</IT> at ma&rehy;ny <IT>scandalous Reports</IT> of the same form and contrivance in&rehy;dustriously spread abroad against the <IT>Subscribers</IT> to, and the <IT>present management</IT> of the <IT>Dispensary</IT>.

And their <IT>Reputation</IT> is answerable for every <IT>Accident</IT> or <IT>Defect</IT>. That they have not <IT>Servants</IT> sufficient, when they can ea&rehy;sily <IT>increase</IT> the <IT>Number</IT> from 3 or 4 to 10: and the want of <IT>Hands</IT>, supposes the <IT>growing</IT> business equal to <IT>defray</IT> the <IT>Charge</IT> of more.

</P><P>In other Conversations I had better success: I had per&rehy;swaded not a few to consult those of the <IT>Society</IT> they e&rehy;steem'd, at the <IT>approach</IT> of the <IT>Spring</IT>. I have had their <IT>thanks</IT> with large Accounts of the difference of the <IT>old</IT> and <IT>new Practice</IT> of <IT>Physick</IT>. So many <IT>Converts</IT> in my <IT>Neighbourhood</IT> brought on me the resentment of my former <IT>Apothecary</IT>. He <IT>expostulated</IT> with me the <IT>ill consequence</IT> to their <IT>Trade</IT> with the most <IT>bitter</IT> and <IT>envenom'd Reflections</IT> on the <IT>Dispensary</IT>, and the <IT>Promoters</IT> of it. You shall judge from his manner of arguing the Case. We do <IT>govern</IT> and <IT>command</IT> all the <IT>Families</IT> in the City. They believe us in every thing, to the advancement of our Trade, and the lessening the <IT>College Interest</IT>. When the <IT>Men</IT> are abroad, or not in the sick <PB
N="13">Chamber, we can recommend what <IT>Physician</IT> we please and <IT>decry</IT> the opposite Party. Do you believe we will spare one of them? Here he took out <IT>hastily</IT> of his Pocket the <IT>scandalous List</IT> Printed at the <IT>desire</IT> of the <IT>Master</IT> and <IT>Wardens</IT> of the <IT>Apothecaries Company</IT>, where our <IT>honest Phy&rehy;sicians</IT> are <IT>distinguish't</IT> by Marks from their <IT>honest Slaves</IT>, which being promiscuous in the <IT>College</IT> order, he blundred thrice, and shew'd me for <IT>Villains</IT>, those of their own <IT>Confederacy</IT>. But after some time he recover'd and told me, they were resolv'd to maintain the <IT>reputation</IT> of what they had <IT>hitherto</IT> done, as well as their <IT>Advantages</IT> over the <IT>College</IT> for the future. Many years since there has not been more than five <IT>Physicians</IT>, who have been <IT>rais'd</IT> but by <IT>serving</IT> us. They are call'd by us <IT>Topping Physicians</IT>, be&rehy;cause we <IT>put</IT> 'em on the <IT>People</IT>, as we please. You may observe, there are now in the Town of several <IT>Sortments</IT> and <IT>different Abilities</IT>, who pass by our <IT>Artifices</IT> for the <IT>greatest Men</IT>. Has not one risen considerably by our <IT>Favour</IT>, who has employ'd much of his time in writing 3 <IT>Folio Poems</IT>, which have been <IT>exploded</IT> by his <IT>Brother Poets</IT> and <IT>Physicians</IT> for the <IT>vilest bombast</IT>, which is now meant by <IT>lofty Poetry, every expression</IT> relating to <IT>Physick</IT> or <IT>Philosophy</IT> prov'd in Print to be <IT>triflingly absurd</IT> or <IT>false</IT>, and judg'd so even by us? Do no several of the <IT>College</IT> come over to us, and <IT>be&rehy;tray</IT> all that passes there? The rest are <IT>afraid</IT>, and dare not be <IT>honest</IT> and <IT>just</IT> to their <IT>Patients</IT>, fearing to incur our displeasure? Will we, think you, pardon him, who cures a <IT>Feaver</IT>, at the rate of 1 or 2 <IT>pounds</IT>, when <CORR
SIC="onr">our</CORR> <IT>Friends</IT>, will raise the Bill for us to 10, 20 or 40? He that brings in the <IT>Fidler</IT> to the <IT>Company</IT>, will make him play what <IT>Tunes</IT> and as often as he pleases. What does the <IT>Dispensary</IT> pretend to impose on the <IT>Publick</IT>, that we are not <IT>useful</IT> out of our <IT>Shops</IT>, who give <IT>Glysters</IT>, dress <IT>Blisters</IT>, and <IT>Bleed</IT> when its easie, and like to have no <IT>ill consequence</IT>. I would not further concern my self, but only put him in mind, that one Sex was accommodated <IT>without them</IT>, and that the o&rehy;ther was properly the business of the <IT>Surgeon</IT>, who at&rehy;tends to these and the greater Cases of <IT>Surgery abroad</IT> with<PB
N="14">out impediment to any part of his <IT>Profession</IT>. Besides, that the <IT>Blisters</IT> often inflam'd or corroded with the <IT>Acrimo&rehy;ny</IT> of the <IT>Humours</IT>, or wanting to be drawn to <IT>evacuate</IT> more freely, required more then the common treatment of the <IT>Melilote Plaister</IT>.</P>
<P>You had, I remember, made me very sensible, how much that <IT>excellent</IT> and most useful Art of <IT>Surgery</IT> was invaded by those bold <IT>Pretenders</IT> to every thing they do not un&rehy;derstand. They <IT>Bleed</IT> without suspecting the <IT>Nerve</IT> or <IT>Ar&rehy;tery</IT> may ly in the way. They apply to <IT>Inflammations</IT> or other <IT>Tumours</IT>, and keep in the <IT>putrid</IT> matter till the <IT>Sinuous, Fistula</IT>, or <IT>rotten bone</IT> gives pain loud enough to call the <IT>Surgeon</IT>.</P>
<P>Having had various <IT>Fortune</IT> abroad, I remembred I was in the Evening to meet a select Company of <IT>Merchants</IT>, and other Eminent Citizens. I determin'd to ask their <IT>as&rehy;sistance</IT> and <IT>council</IT>. I shew'd them all your <IT>Papers</IT>, and laid before 'em in all the <IT>Informations</IT> relating to the <IT>College</IT>, and our own immediate Interest. Some were discoursing of the <IT>Treaties</IT> abroad, and the common danger of our <IT>Liber&rehy;ty</IT> and <IT>Property</IT> from another sort of Invader. But at mine and our <IT>Friends</IT> request who were there, we came to debate of our more immediate concern, leaving the other to the <IT>Physicians</IT>, proper in those <IT>Cases</IT>. I was de&rehy;sired by them to give you a farther trouble, that you would remove the common <IT>opprobrium</IT> on the <IT>Profession</IT>, that it wants certainty and acts often by <IT>conjecture</IT>: And that more scandalous, that the <IT>Apothecary</IT> by seeing the Patient and you at the Bed-side is able to give <IT>Physick</IT> himself. And (after our Assertion of the cheapness of the best <IT>Medicines</IT>, and some contests about it) that you would, as in our <IT>Papers</IT> for <IT>sale</IT> by the <IT>Candle</IT>, give a pret&rehy;ty near <IT>Estimate</IT> of the <IT>value</IT> of every <IT>Preparation</IT> and <IT>Com&rehy;position</IT> or <IT>Simple</IT> now us'd in <IT>Physick</IT>.</P>
<P>We must wait for this <IT>Account</IT>, upon which the whole <IT>Controversy</IT> depends, but the <IT>Company</IT> would not doubt of the <IT>easie prizes</IT> of the most effectual <IT>Remedies</IT>, (as are fit for the use of that <IT>Prince</IT> now the regard of all <IT>Eu&rehy;rope</IT>) many of us having us'd of several kinds, of which <PB
N="15">the <IT>Dose</IT> was of no <IT>great value</IT>. After having <IT>lamented</IT> the <IT>miserable Condition</IT> of the <IT>Poor</IT>, and the vile <IT>treatment</IT> of all others these last 40 years, they were pleas'd they had now a prospect of better and more <IT>humane usage</IT>. They re&rehy;solv'd, they would make all their Acquaintance sensible of the <IT>generous</IT> design of the <IT>Dispensary</IT>, and engage 'em to the most industrious publication of its use, the only <IT>Pana&rehy;cea</IT> to the many <IT>Calamities</IT> of the sick. That they would not doubt to <IT>convince</IT> the most hitherto <IT>obstinate</IT> or <IT>heed&rehy;less opposers</IT> of it. That the <IT>Apothecary</IT> must be oblig'd to keep his <IT>Shop</IT>, that all his <IT>Medicines</IT> may be made at <IT>home</IT>, and <IT>dispenc't</IT> with his own <IT>hand</IT>, or under his careful <IT>in&rehy;spection</IT>. That his <IT>Apprentice</IT> may be imploy'd in the <IT>Shop</IT> to <IT>learn</IT> his <IT>Trade</IT>, and to be taken of from the <IT>giddy am&rehy;bition</IT> of <IT>aping</IT> a <IT>Profession</IT> a little too far <IT>remov'd</IT> from his. That our <IT>Servants</IT> shall be constantly sent for the Physick, the <IT>Directions</IT> being left at our Houses by the proper <IT>hand</IT>, that each of us sending our <IT>Porters</IT>, the <IT>hurry</IT> and <IT>confusi&rehy;on</IT> may be taken off from the Apothecary and his <IT>Servants</IT>, by which, many <IT>Patients Physick</IT> being convey'd at one time, the <IT>deadly Accidents</IT> which now frequently happen, may be <IT>avoided</IT>. Our <IT>Messenger</IT> will find the <IT>Shop</IT> sedately for&rehy;warding their important affair, every one will wait the <IT>mixture</IT> for his Master, by which the possibility of a <IT>mi&rehy;stake</IT> will be <IT>prevented</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>College</IT> will be safe from the <IT>temptations</IT> they now ly under, and from being in so large numbers <IT>debaucht</IT> from their <IT>vertue</IT>, and their <IT>indispensable duty</IT> to their <IT>Patient</IT>, which branches into every <IT>distinct</IT> regard of his Welfare. And, whereas the present <IT>one Thousand</IT> have 2 or 3 Ap&rehy;prentices each, which multiplying in the same <IT>Proportion</IT>, must raise the <IT>prizes</IT> of <IT>Physick</IT>, and the <IT>Quantity</IT> and the <IT>Industry</IT> of giving more, to the ruine at last of their credit with the People, there is no other method even to <IT>preserve themselves</IT>. The <IT>Families</IT> will then, as formerly, make choice of a <IT>Physician</IT> from the visible success of his <IT>Art</IT>, and not with the greatest degree of stupidness, ask the Apothe&rehy;cary to bring one. Since from their <IT>numbers</IT> they are forc't <PB
N="16">to make the greatest <IT>profit</IT> of every <IT>Patient</IT>, which strong <IT>Byass</IT> naturally inclines him to a <IT>Physician</IT> most useful in that case. 'Twas resolv'd, after your answer of the <IT>prizes</IT>, to oblige the <IT>Physician</IT> to rate the <IT>Prescription</IT> sent to the <IT>Apothecary</IT> at the fairest <IT>Profit</IT>, to be paid at farthest after the <IT>Recovery</IT>: And to prevent the sipping of <IT>Cordials</IT> and <IT>Pearl Juleps</IT>, as <IT>Usquebaugh</IT> at the <IT>Coffee-house</IT>, upon every little humour of taking, promoted by the <IT>casual</IT> visit, and <IT>encourag'd</IT> by the mean and vile custom of going upon <IT>Tick</IT> till <IT>Christmas</IT>. A modest <IT>Gentleman</IT> gave his <IT>Assent</IT> with some doubt of success, that he would at home propose these considerations to the best advantage he could.</P>
<P>Another, who sees through the Town, demanded what hope there may be to repell the <IT>confidence</IT> of the Men of the <IT>Bottle</IT>, and <IT>Wit</IT> and <IT>Banter</IT>, which admire only the <IT>child&rehy;ish</IT> wantonness of <IT>Thought</IT>, and the pretty <IT>Deviations</IT> from <IT>good sense</IT>, and therefore Character the Men of their Parts and Dress into the publick Esteem. They were left to their <IT>Fortune</IT> and <IT>Experience</IT> of others more discerning, and concluded, that the <IT>Signature</IT> ought to be taken from other affairs of equal concern and importance. The ablest <IT>Pilot</IT>, is put into the Ship, to be sail'd out or brought in&rehy;to Port. The <IT>Gravity, Learning, Application</IT> of a <IT>Judge</IT> is observ'd, when a <IT>Cause</IT> of Life or Estate is heard before him. We shall then raise our <IT>Hope</IT> of <IT>Recovery</IT>, from the manner our Cases will be weigh'd and consider'd, before the Verdict and Judgment shall be given. When you shan't be brought in <FOREIGN

We shall know, who merits our gratitude and applause, and shall put down that <IT>Infamous Custom</IT> of accusing the <IT>Physician</IT> almost in the <IT>Burial Ticket</IT>. A Practice too vile to be expos'd, to <IT>impute</IT> the <IT>misfortune</IT> to the <IT>honest</IT> industry of the <IT>Physician</IT>, when he has not been consulted till the extremity, after many days dosing by our selves and <IT>visitants</IT>, and the <IT>Apothecary</IT>, not allowing the fair <IT>Inquest</IT> of <IT>Dissection</IT>, which would discover the <IT>Pas<PB
N="17">sages</IT> of the <IT>Heart stopt</IT>, the <IT>Ulcers</IT> or <IT>Gangrenes</IT> of the <IT>Vis&rehy;cera</IT>. We were agreed to <IT>controul</IT> our <IT>Families</IT>, and <IT>perswade</IT> our Friends to the same <IT>Resolutions</IT>: and were about to part, when one of our <IT>Society</IT>, who had been silent some time, exprest himself with some Heat, from the <IT>Relation</IT> he had to some of the <IT>Faculty</IT>.

<P>&Iic; Perceive you lay the <IT>greatest stress</IT> on the <IT>last Enquiry</IT> of the <IT>low prizes</IT> of <IT>Medicines</IT>, because you observe that the <IT>large Bills</IT> of the <IT>Apothecary</IT> are the best <IT>argument</IT> with the <IT>People</IT> of his <IT>Ability</IT> to advise, and while they believe, the <IT>Disease</IT> is treated very much by <IT>Guess</IT>, and on <IT>Conjectures</IT>, they are not very solicitous, who throws the <IT>Dice</IT> for their <IT>Lives</IT>.

<PB N="24"><P><IT>Bezoar</IT> is a stony Concretion of an Animal, <IT>despis'd</IT> and <IT>rejected</IT> by most <IT>Physicians</IT>, who think on what they advise.

The very name of <IT>Bezoardick</IT> makes the cheapest <IT>Boles</IT> and <IT>Juleps</IT>, pass of at any price, which shall be put upon them. The large round <IT>Pearl</IT> looks well on a Healthy Skin, but the History which tells us, that <IT>Cleopatra</IT> drank one very large in a health to <IT>Anthony</IT>, does not instruct us, that her <IT>Health</IT> was im&rehy;prov'd by it.

<P>But the Contrivance lately brought into <IT>Practice</IT> of gi&rehy;ving in a <IT>parcht Mouth</IT>, and <IT>fur'd Throat</IT>, and <IT>nauseating sto&rehy;mach</IT>, an ill tasted <IT>Bole</IT>, when the <IT>languishing</IT> and <IT>loathing</IT> Patient can swallow nothing but <IT>Liquids</IT>, has been reserv'd for this Age of ours, and can last no longer. This <IT>Bole</IT> of a <IT>fulsome Conserve</IT> or <IT>Treacle</IT> is to be taken every third, fourth, or sixth hour, which dispells all <IT>Rest</IT> and <IT>Composed&rehy;ness</IT>, the great <IT>Restorers</IT>, by the <IT>Torments</IT>, and <IT>struggles</IT> of forc&rehy;ing it into the <IT>stuff't Throat</IT> and <IT>Stomach</IT>, which rises against it.</P>
<P>There's a little <IT>Julep</IT> ready to wash it down and reward him for his <IT>trouble</IT>. When the <IT>Bole</IT> cannot easily, be taken down, its impertinently half mixt in a <IT>spoon</IT> in the <IT>Cham&rehy;ber</IT>, which should have been brought well <IT>compounded</IT>, on<PB
N="29">ly so many <IT>distinct Articles</IT> in the <IT>Bill</IT> are to be <IT>preserv'd</IT>. This is of the greatest <IT>Consequence</IT> to the <IT>Apothecary</IT>, because the <IT>Town</IT> has been us'd to pay 2<IT>s.</IT> 6<IT>d.</IT> for each Bole, and not much less for the little <IT>Draught</IT>, to cleans the mouth after it. This <IT>Advice</IT> was therefore given to a <IT>Physici&rehy;an</IT> at his first entrance on the Stage, that he should order a <IT>Bole</IT>, with a <IT>Draught</IT> every fourth hour, which, however it far'd with the <IT>Patient</IT>, would <IT>recommend</IT> him to the <IT>Apothecaries</IT>, and thence <IT>publick esteem</IT> for that service.</P>
<P>The honest <IT>Physician</IT> mixes the <IT>Bole</IT> and <IT>Julep</IT> together, that the <IT>feeble restless Patient</IT> may drink his <IT>Cordial</IT> to re&rehy;vive or compose him, without the dusturbance of taking it at twice, and with difficulty the other way.</P>
<P>I presume you will allow the <IT>Corollary</IT>, that by much <IT>Phy&rehy;sick</IT> divided into little <IT>parcels</IT>, rated so high, the Apothe&rehy;cary has in the reward of his <IT>Attendance</IT> (which by the <IT>Physician</IT> is often excus'd) much greater Fees, often <IT>trebly</IT> or <IT>quadruply</IT> more then the Faculty. You will not therefore be surpriz'd, if it be asserted, that in a <IT>Bill</IT> of ten <IT>Pounds</IT> nine are the reward of his <IT>Advice</IT> and <IT>Attendance</IT>, and in all the other <IT>sums proportionably</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>People</IT> must accuse their own <IT>Conduct</IT>, who never gra&rehy;tifiying the <IT>Apothecarys</IT> visit, oblige him in the Case, where one <IT>Medicine</IT> removes the <IT>Distemper</IT>, to bring in for every 3 or 4 <IT>Hours</IT>, and several <IT>Days</IT>, as much as will answer one of the Ends he proposes to himself. Can he thus neglect&rehy;ed by his Customers, with safety to himself advise the <IT>Wa&rehy;ters, Milk, Temperance, Repose, Exercise</IT> or a <IT>peculiar Diet</IT>, or the <IT>Country Air</IT>, by which obstinate <IT>Diseases</IT> are cur'd: But to the reproach of the Compositions of the Shop.</P>
<P>But what <IT>Redress</IT> can be expected to all these <IT>Grievances</IT>?</P>
<P>There must be certain <IT>Rates</IT> set to all the Medicines, with the greatest encouragement to the <IT>Apothecary</IT> to pre&rehy;pare them <IT>faithfully</IT>.</P>
<P>They must bring their number by the most proper Methods to be equal to the <IT>occasion</IT> the City has of using their Preparations.</P>
<PB N="30"><P>The former <IT>Antiquated</IT> Methods must be reviv'd, by which the <IT>People</IT> were easie, without the present either <IT>suspicions</IT> or <IT>complaints</IT>.
</P><P>The <IT>Physicians</IT> lay under no <IT>temptations</IT> to impose on the <IT>Publick</IT>. They advis'd at their <IT>Houses</IT> in the <IT>Chronical</IT> or less dangerous <IT>disorders</IT>, and distinguish't in their visits the differ&rehy;ences of the <IT>Condition</IT> of the Persons and Diseases; arriv'd to a <IT>Reputation</IT>, not by the basest Arts, but their care and the me&rehy;rit of their <IT>Success</IT>.</P>
