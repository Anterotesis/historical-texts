<HEAD>Newes from the New-EXCHANGE, or the Commonwealth of Ladies, drawn to the Life, in their severall Characters and Concernments.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;Here was a time in <IT>England</IT>, when men <IT>wore the Breeches</IT>, and debar'd women of their <IT>Liberty</IT>; which brought many grievances and op&rehy;pressions upon the <IT>weaker vessels</IT>; for, they were constrained to converse only with their <IT>homes and closets</IT>, and now and then with the <IT>Gen&rehy;tleman-usher</IT>, or the <IT>Foot-man</IT> (when they could catch him) for variety: So that in those dayes, there was no such thing as the SERVANT, the FRIEND, or the INTIMATE in ordinary; nor durst they be acquainted with the <IT>mode</IT> of <IT>Drinke, Dice</IT>, and <IT>Tobacco</IT>; nor <IT>rore</IT> and convert their smoks into <IT>Colanders</IT>, to strain healths <PB
N="2">of <IT>Sack</IT> into <IT>Beer-glasses</IT>, and take them off astride upon mens shoulders. In consideration whereof, and divers other inconveniences, by the tyranny of men, the <IT>Ladies Rampant</IT> of the times, in their last <IT>Parliament</IT>, knowing themselves to be a part of the <IT>free people</IT> of this Nation, unanimously re&rehy;solved to assert their own <IT>freedoms</IT>; and casting off the intolerable yoke of their <IT>Lords</IT> and <IT>Hus&rehy;bands</IT>, have voted themselves the <IT>Supreme Au&rehy;thority</IT> both at home and abroad, and setled them&rehy;selves in the posture of a <IT>Free-State</IT>, as may appeare by their <IT>Practices</IT>.
</P><P>In the first place, for the well ordering of their <IT>Militia</IT>, they have lifted themselves under the conduct of the Right Honorable the Countesse of <IT>Kent</IT>, and the old Countesse of <IT>Exceter</IT>; who ought to lead the <IT>Van</IT>, being experienced Souldi&rehy;ers, that have passed through all Offices in <IT>Venus</IT> Warrs, from a <IT>Corporall</IT> to a <IT>Colonell</IT>. These two are the only pillars of Nobility and Hospitality; who, to breed up the <IT>young Fry</IT> in the Misteries of the <IT>Sexe</IT>, have erected an <IT>Academy</IT>, which is o&rehy;pened every <IT>Sunday</IT> night at the Countesse of <IT>Kent's</IT> and every <IT>Thursday</IT> at my Lady of <IT>Exceter's</IT>. There <IT>Suppers</IT> are reckoned most convenient, because the <IT>Bed</IT> follows, and it is judged the best way of disgestion after the <IT>Lectures</IT>, they never being up&rehy;on any other Subject, but WHO with WHO, <IT>Mistresses</IT> and <IT>Servants</IT>, and the <IT>Act of well-doing</IT>, which must needs breake the <IT>Academy</IT> of <IT>well spea<PB
N="3">king</IT>, and soon make the <IT>Italian</IT> Knight lose all his Custome, for going the wrong way to worke with our <IT>English</IT> Ladies.</P>
<P>And if he dare dispute the matter, wee will re&rehy;fer it to my Lady <IT>Carlisle</IT>. This is a Lady indeed, that seven years since took saile with Presbytery, being charged in the <IT>Fore-deck</IT> by Master <IT>Hollis</IT>, in the <IT>Poop</IT> by Master <IT>Pym</IT>, whilst she clapt my Lord of <IT>Holland</IT> under hatches. And this was a lucky <IT>Supply</IT> at that time, because <IT>Toby Matthewes</IT> and <IT>Wat. Mountague</IT> were both <IT>fled for Religion</IT>. About 3 years since, being weary with that <IT>facti&rehy;on</IT>, she revived a correspondence upon the <IT>Royall accompt</IT>; among the rest with divers <IT>foreine Am&rehy;bassadors</IT>; especially <IT>Mons. Believerey</IT>, till she was put in the <IT>Tower</IT>, where she now pines away for want of <IT>fresh-Cod</IT>, and knoweth not which way to lead her <IT>Nags</IT> to water, since the <IT>State</IT> hath cut off all her <IT>pipes</IT> of intelligence.</P>
<P>After her comes the old Lady <IT>Peterburgh</IT>, who would faine be yong. A <IT>Presbyterian</IT> Lady too, that casts a sad looke with her eies for the downfall of her <IT>Faction</IT>, and sings the <IT>lamentation of a sinner</IT> for the losse of Mr. <IT>Hollis</IT>, but above all for the Irre&rehy;parable losse she had in <IT>Tom. Gell</IT>, when my Lady <IT>Rutland</IT> got him from her.</P>
<P>'Twere pitty my old Lady <IT>Devonshire</IT> and these two should be parted, for, the <IT>Presbyterie</IT> was set&rehy;led first in her house by the <IT>Scots Commissioners</IT>; where my L. <IT>Louden, Lauderdale</IT>, and <IT>Dumferling</IT>, <PB
N="4">were clapt in her <IT>hole of Repentance</IT>, to forward the work of <IT>Reformation</IT>.</P>
<P>And now we talk of <IT>Reformation</IT>, God help my Lady <IT>Salisbury</IT>, whose Sinnes are as big as her Bo&rehy;dy, and whose faults are better known at home than abroad, since the death of the old Duke of <IT>Buckingham</IT> and my Lord of <IT>Holland</IT>. A very charitable Mother she is to all her Children; but especially to her daughter my Lady <IT>Sands</IT>, having helpt her to a <IT>Touch</IT>, with her Son in Law my Lord <IT>Lisle</IT>, though my Lord of <IT>Salisbury</IT> himself, like a crosse Father, <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">My Ladie <IT>Sands</IT> was warming her Brother <IT>Lisles</IT> drawers by the fire Side.</NOTE> came in and took her airing his <IT>Drawers</IT>. This Lady <IT>Sands</IT> continues her <IT>Clack</IT> going ever since, to draw <IT>grists</IT> to the <IT>Mill</IT>, and is at this time one of the greatest <IT>Coursers</IT> upon the <IT>New Exchange</IT>; She out-drinks a <IT>Dutch man</IT>, out&rehy;vies a <IT>Courtesan</IT>, and is good at all <IT>Games</IT>, but loves none like <IT>In and In</IT>, and sometimes she is for <IT>Pas&rehy;sage</IT>. In league with her are all the <IT>Hat-and-fea&rehy;ther-Gallants</IT>, the <IT>feather</IT> being the proper <IT>Hie&rehy;roglyphick</IT> of her Condition, and the Badge of her <IT>faction</IT>.</P>
<P>As for her good Sister, the yong Lady <IT>Devon&rehy;shire</IT>, She hath been a very sad woman ever since the death of my <IT>Lord Iohn</IT>; but since that, She hath been rid of her <IT>Qualm</IT> by <IT>Tom Killegrew</IT>, who is now gon Ambassador from <IT>Iersey</IT> into <IT>Italy</IT>, on purpose to fetch her a <IT>Musk-cod</IT> to perfect the Cure.</P>
<P>This Family is both large and godly; and there<PB N="5">fore we must not forget my Lady <IT>Cranborn</IT>; who lives in a <IT>Scotish mist</IT> betwixt light and darknesse so that groping often for Truth, She now and then layes hold upon the <IT>Preacher</IT>, and puts him beside the <IT>Text</IT>, in an error. She playes above-board with Mr. <IT>Sackvile</IT> , under-board with Mr. <IT>Sterry</IT>, and severall other <IT>Captains</IT> that usually preach <IT>before her</IT> and the <IT>Councell of State</IT>. She hath preferred one <IT>Lee</IT> Lecturer at <IT>St. Martin's</IT>, to read <IT>lectures</IT> on Sunday nights to the whole <IT>Family</IT>, concerning <IT>due Benevolence</IT>; which gave occasion to Mistris <IT>Peele</IT> (an <IT>Intimate</IT> of theirs) to commend his do&rehy;ctrine above all others.</P>
<P>And now, not forgetting an over-thwart neigh&rehy;bor of theirs we must think of my Lady <IT>Forster</IT>; an old <IT>Mistresse</IT> and a yong <IT>Saint</IT>; one whose propor&rehy;tion puts us in mind of her <IT>Excellencies</IT>, and he that meanes to board her, must put off his doublet and swim, it being of the same size with a <IT>Fish&rehy;Pond</IT>: yet it is ten to one if he scape sinking, since she is somewhat of kin to <IT>Goodwin Sands</IT>, having swallowed up many <IT>Families</IT>, many <IT>Blew Gariers, Georges, Earls</IT>, and <IT>Baronies</IT> innumerable. Among them, as the latest (though of a long continuance) is the Lord <IT>Willoughby</IT> of <IT>Parham</IT>; who hath now taken a journey to the <IT>Barbado's</IT> and means to pipe her one way since he cannot another; In Order whereunto he hath provided her a whole plantati&rehy;on of Tobacco, it being her proper Element; so that since my Lord finds <IT>Smeak</IT>, Sir <IT>Humphry</IT> may in <PB
N="6">time have <IT>Bacon</IT>. I would have this Lady well pre&rehy;ferr'd in the <IT>Commonwealth</IT>, she being now a great <IT>Retailer of Courtesies</IT>.</P>
<P>And truly her Daughter my Lady <IT>Prat</IT> (for ought I see) is resolved to keep up the <IT>Trade</IT>, ha&rehy;ving an Husband for the purpose. This is that doughty Knight Sir <IT>George Prat</IT>, once celebrated in <IT>Comedy</IT>, and pawned upon the <IT>Stage</IT> (as well as at the <IT>Tavern</IT>) in a <IT>Ioynt-Stool</IT> for a Reckoning. Hee, Sir <IT>Samuel Luke, Ieffery</IT>, and little <IT>Trott</IT>, may help to make up the Nine <IT>Worthies</IT> among the <IT>Pig&rehy;mies</IT>, and might passe for rare Champions in <IT>Ame&rehy;rica</IT>, to erect a new <IT>Common wealth</IT> among the <IT>Monkies</IT>. Indeed, take Sir <IT>George</IT>, hornes and all, and he is a very formidable <IT>Monster</IT>; so that 'tis no wonder if his <IT>Lady</IT> be reprehended by her <IT>Mo&rehy;ther</IT>, for being <IT>Bull'd by an Urchin</IT>: She is a great <IT>wit</IT>, and playes with an old <IT>Sophister</IT> (Dr. <IT>Smell&rehy;smock, alias</IT> Mr. <IT>Osbaston</IT>) who jerks her both be&rehy;hind, and before; therefore Mr. <IT>Lenthall</IT>, though he have playd <IT>Truant</IT> a great while, may the rather scape a whipping.</P>
<P>Come, take your Turn Mrs. <IT>Gamlyn</IT>; for, you have had many a one by that excellent Squire of the Body yong <IT>Lenthall</IT>, who hath the art to love if the Women love him. They say, <IT>Northamptoc</IT> makes love one hour to you, and he beats the brains of it out in a quarter. This Gentleman broaches <IT>maxims</IT> very dangerous to the Common-wealth of Wo&rehy;men, <IT>viz. That there is no woman honest. That wo<PB
N="7">men would become unnecessary in the world, if that damnable principle of honesty should be professed. That originally there was no such quality as honesty, only it was insinuated by the perswasions of the first mother, to keep women from being debauched in their nurses arms</IT>. All which hath been applauded, and seal'd to, by the same <IT>Gentleman</IT>, over and over.</P>
<P>Now, as a brave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="margin">Supposed a Hermaphrodite.</NOTE> <IT>Woman-man-of-mettle</IT>, beigh for my Lady <IT>Hungerford</IT>. Since Sir <IT>Edward</IT> is in Heaven, the fittest <IT>mate</IT> for her upon Earth, must needs be <IT>Annis-water Robbin</IT>, For they may fit one another by turns, and be beholding to no bo&rehy;dy. This <IT>Lady</IT> over-rid and excarnated, no lesse than three of her women in her husbands life-time; and hath left no part of foure <IT>Gentlemen-ushers</IT> vi&rehy;sible in the world, but their <IT>periwigs</IT>; but the fifth scapes yet, and may perhaps for a twelve&rehy;month.</P>
<P>Room next for my Lady <IT>Kingsmell</IT>; who having been lately in <IT>France</IT>, hath brought over some <IT>I&rehy;talian</IT> tricks with her. The only wit in that house is <IT>new lechery</IT>, and her Daughter is <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">vostre Serviteur</FOREIGN></IT>. The Mother should have been married to my Lord of <IT>Norwich</IT>, at his coming out of prison, but that of late he is become as dry as his jests, and the talke of the town diverted the humor.</P>
<P>But my Lady <IT>Rutland</IT> (God wot) is a more re&rehy;solute Lover; for, now that her Lord is out of Town, nothing can stave her off from <IT>Tom. Gell</IT>. This fellow the world suspected to be Eunuch to <PB
N="8">my Lord of <IT>Newcastle</IT>; but now she commends him for the swetest man in the world though of late she hath a great stroke too with <IT>Harry Martyn</IT>.</P>
<P>And now we talk of a <IT>stroak</IT>, I can tell you of a notable <IT>Striker</IT> one Mrs. <IT>Luson</IT>, who hath blowne up and broke so many <IT>French, Dutch</IT> and <IT>Spanish</IT> Merchants, that none of late durst deal with her but <IT>Hugh Peters</IT>; who (I hear) hath pawned halfe the <IT>fleet</IT> at <IT>Mildford</IT>-haven to provide her a <IT>new yeares gift</IT>; and this in imitation of his Masters at <IT>West&rehy;minster</IT>, who ever put the Charges of their <IT>Leche&rehy;ry</IT> upon the accompts of the <IT>Publique</IT>.</P>
<P>This policy of <IT>Hugh Peters</IT>, puts us in mind of godly <IT>Gravener</IT>, he that is <IT>Commissary</IT> to my Lady <IT>Fairfax</IT>; who hath pawned his <IT>Commission</IT> for a&rehy;nother couple of <IT>Flanders</IT> horses, to make sure of Mistris <IT>Luson</IT>: And she I think hath paid him pret&rehy;ty well; for the poor <IT>Gent.</IT> hath spit himselfe into a <IT>Night cap</IT>, and the next Remove may be into a <IT>Coffin</IT>.</P>
<P>If ever the <IT>new Common weal</IT> be routed, it must be by this <IT>Lady</IT>; for, put a little <IT>Gunpowder</IT> to her <IT>Mercury</IT>, and you may soon blow up my Lord <IT>Bradshaw</IT>. He (they say) hath audited her Phisicke <IT>Bill</IT>, and the <IT>Councell</IT> of <IT>State</IT> finds many faults in it As <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Inprimis</FOREIGN></IT>, on purge for a <IT>clap</IT> she had from Sir <IT>Harry Mildmay</IT>, which was much invenom'd by one he caught the morning before from <IT>Besse</IT> the <IT>Begger wench</IT>.</P>
<LIST><ITEM><IT>Item</IT> a Plaister for the <IT>swelling</IT> in her <IT>Groin</IT>, that <PB
N="9">Mr. <IT>Marten</IT> gave her from a <IT>Shanker</IT> of his, which he caught from the <IT>Wench</IT> he stole from his Bro&rehy;ther-Member Sir <IT>Roger North</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><IT>Item</IT>, an <IT>Astringent</IT> for a <IT>Gonorrh</IT>&oelig;a, given her by Mr. <IT>Sco</IT>, which hath been entailed upon him and his Family, ever since he strain'd at the <IT>Brewers</IT> daughter behind the <IT>Ale-fat</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><IT>Item</IT>, for a <IT>Pimple</IT>, which my Lord of <IT>Denbigh</IT> entailed on the Top of her <IT>Belly</IT> from the Tip of his <IT>Nose</IT>. The <IT>Pothecary</IT> pleaded this cure was extra&rehy;ordinary, because the <IT>Rubyes</IT> in my <IT>Lord's</IT> nose, might have caused a <IT>Carbuncle</IT> in her <IT>Cabinet</IT>, had it not been prevented (according to my <IT>Lord's</IT> owne direction) with an <IT>emollient Clyster</IT> over night, a Dose of <IT>Pills</IT> in the morning, and an <IT>electuary</IT> from the same <IT>Lord</IT> the night following.</ITEM>
<ITEM><IT>Item</IT> for fluxing, fuming, soking, and Tubbing of <IT>Heveningham</IT>, a worthy <IT>Member</IT>; yet all will do no good, For, this <IT>Lady</IT> and he have been so long of the <IT>same humor</IT>, that he cannot be cured of a <IT>Rhume</IT>, that hangs on both sides his mouth, so that ere long he may be <IT>Chapfall'n</IT>. This <IT>Malady</IT> hath been much exasperated by an ill <IT>prepared flux</IT>, which hath left him more of <IT>Mercury</IT> than <IT>Venus</IT> in his Body. Ask my Lady <IT>Lake</IT> else, who did what wo&rehy;man could for him, plyed him with <IT>Cordials</IT> and warm <IT>Plaisters</IT>: but <IT>broke his head</IT> when she said, <IT>She wondred hir Cozen</IT> Heveningham <IT>would have to do with so rotten a woman</IT>. As she wounds some, so she <IT>shaves</IT> others; for she has made Mr. <IT>Love</IT> a <PB
N="10">wofull Example, who never wore any beard since her first acquaintance.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>Oh, let us not now forget Mistris <IT>Duns</IT>, a Lady every jot as <IT>Independent</IT> as the former, she hath payed Tribute to all the Deputies of <IT>Ireland</IT>, and will not now forbear her Cosen <IT>Cromwell</IT>. Shee keeps mighty Intelligence too with his wife, and she with <IT>Hugh Peters</IT>, and <IT>Peters</IT> with Mistris <IT>Ire&rehy;ton</IT>, she with <IT>Bradshaw</IT>, he with Madam <IT>Castlehaven</IT>, as <IT>Cromwell</IT> with Mrs. <IT>Lambert</IT>.</P>
<P>Now enter my Lady <IT>Craven</IT>, at a conference over her Cups. <IT>Fie sister fie; never a Beer-glasse of Sack to Sir</IT> William Sidley's <IT>health? yes, my Lady</IT> Craven, <IT>here's one, fill a Brimmer, to that part of my Sister</IT> Craven <IT>which Sir</IT> William <IT>loves best. 'Tis well fill'd , and fairely drunke. Now to do you right, my Lady</IT> Mary, <IT>here is to you; to the finishing of Sir</IT> Williams <IT>desires, let it be how, where, and when he pleases. Come, my Lady</IT> Mary Howard, <IT>take courage; though thy fortune be but small, yet having a good stroke, thou shalt drinke</IT> Dormer <IT>into Matri&rehy;mony</IT>.</P>
<P>Tis the wonder of the world, Why Sir <IT>Kenelm Digby</IT>, should be so mad for my Lady <IT>Middlesex</IT>, since he boarded her and the Gallies at <IT>Scanderoon</IT> much about the same time, and hath rid at Anchor ever since. Tis a very hard matter to know whe&rehy;ther she be, a <IT>Lady</IT> or <IT>Leviathan</IT>. Sure, none but <IT>Goliahs</IT> weapon can fit her <IT>Scabbard</IT>, nor can any hand but his with the <IT>six fingers</IT> sufficiently <IT>feele</IT> her; <PB
N="11">and he that will please her (which she abundant&rehy;ly loves) must convert a <IT>weavers beam</IT> into a <IT>dildo</IT>. If she and Sir <IT>Kenelme</IT> go on with the <IT>Match</IT>, then let the <IT>Saints</IT> beware; for, I beleeve <IT>Gog</IT> and <IT>Ma&rehy;gog</IT> will come of the <IT>Progeny</IT>.</P>
<P>But what thinke you of my Lady Marchionesse of <IT>Winchester</IT> and Colonell <IT>Warren</IT>? Though my <IT>Lord</IT> be her Husband, yet the Colonell is the man. Though my <IT>Lord</IT> have a good <IT>Bable</IT> by descent, and may play well, yet the Col. hits the <IT>blot</IT> oftner in his <IT>Ladie's Tables</IT>. She is often sick, and as often swels, and, by the opinion of all <IT>Doctors</IT>, no cure is like that in private with her Colonell.</P>
<P><IT>Boles</IT> was an able fellow too once, before he came to be my Lady of <IT>Bath's</IT> Gentleman usher: But you may guesse how the VVorld goes with him now; for he <IT>dwindles</IT> every day, and (some say) the <IT>Calves</IT> of his legs are left in his Ladies Belly; so that when my <IT>Lord</IT> expected a Son, God knows it proved a <IT>Moon Calfe</IT>; and had it grown up to have <IT>horns</IT>, my <IT>Lord</IT> might then have hoped it was of his own begetting.</P>
<P>Poor <IT>Jack Young</IT>! my Lady <IT>Monmouth</IT> bites hard too; for, she hath drawn him so low, that he will never make <IT>Mummy</IT>; and therefore in&rehy;tends to prefer him for a living <IT>Skeleton</IT> to <IT>Surgeon's</IT> hall, as a very neat Subject for an <IT>Anatomy</IT> lecture. And indeed, it is high time he were some way disposed of, for, his <IT>fore-man</IT> is so flag, and his hams so feeble, that my Lady is constrained still to <PB
N="12">cry out [<IT>Thy finger againe</IT>, Jack.]</P>
<P>I beleeve the <IT>Parson</IT> too is puzled, to interpret the barrennesse of my Lady <IT>Stanhope</IT>, she gives him the opening of many a hard <IT>Text</IT>, so that he will have much ado to resolve the <IT>Tithe</IT>, of her <IT>Doctrine</IT> into <IT>use</IT> and <IT>Applycation</IT>; for (tis known) she is much given to <IT>Hunting</IT>, and hath run down a whole <IT>kennell</IT> at a time for recreation. Her mouth is (like <IT>mopsaes</IT>) <IT>O Heavenly wide</IT>, so that her <IT>Taile</IT> being of the same size in dimension, 'tis possible <IT>Stamford</IT> may passe through her, booted and spur'd to seek <IT>new fortunes</IT> in <IT>America</IT>.</P>
<P>There is another notable <IT>Lady</IT> too, newly come out of <IT>France</IT> and knowes all the feats of that coun&rehy;try, and is now set up in <IT>England</IT>, by name my Lady <IT>Mountague</IT>; all spirit of <IT>Sulphur</IT>: for, she takes fire immediately, and evaporates without con&rehy;ception; so that we must leave her to the skill of <IT>Ben. Weston</IT>, to provide a Son for my Lord <IT>Monta&rehy;gue</IT>, as the <IT>Prince Elector</IT> did for my Lord <IT>Moul&rehy;grave</IT>. And if ever <IT>Ben.</IT> mean to effect it, let him keep her <IT>Ladiship</IT> only to himselfe, and recall her <IT>Ambassadors</IT>, which lie <IT>Leiger</IT> for <IT>strong backs</IT>, in City and Country.</P>
<P>She trades not so openly, but others are as close; yet <IT>Murther</IT> will out: for, 'tis known well enough (though carried in private) how often Mr. <IT>Villiers</IT> hath come the <IT>Back way</IT> over a wall, to the fore way of my Lady <IT>Savile</IT>, alias <IT>Sussex</IT>; and she usually helps him down in her armes, for feare of a strai&rehy;ning.</P>
<PB N="13"><P>Newes, newes, The Dutchesse hath a Son and heir, in the absence of Prince <IT>Rupert</IT>. But ---- &amp;c.
</P><P>If Madam <IT>Newport</IT> should not be link't with these <IT>Ladyes</IT>, the <IT>chain</IT> would never hold; for, she is Sister to the famous Mrs. <IT>Porter</IT> (who of late plaies the <IT>Macquerela</IT> in the behalf of her owne Son;) and to the more famous Lady <IT>Marlborough</IT> (whose Paint is her <IT>Pander</IT>.) This Lady <IT>Newport</IT> leads the Lord <IT>Bellasis</IT> in one hand, and <IT>Iack Rus&rehy;sell</IT> in the other, and cuts a kindnes so equally <CORR
SIC="be&rehy;between">between</CORR> them, that Sir <IT>Kenelm Digby</IT> needed not have come in to decide the controversie. Yet ha&rehy;ving beat the <IT>Bush</IT> so often, there's no reason but he should catch the <IT>Bird</IT>, and these two <IT>Gentlemen</IT>, when he comes, be turned loose to ruminate the Favor.</P>
<P>And that this <IT>Lady</IT> may not go without her fel&rehy;low, if you are <IT>coloured</IT>, my Lady <IT>Elizabeth Darcy</IT>, appeare as <IT>Stanhope</IT>, alias <IT>Chesterfields</IT> Daughter. Take confidence, such as your Sister <IT>Stanhope</IT> did, when she met <IT>Hatton Rich</IT> upon the stairs, whilst her Husband (good man!) was making his <IT>Will</IT>. Manage your designe well; there is no feare but you may trail both Sir <IT>Andrew</IT>, and Mr. <IT>Glascock</IT>, as long as they can crawle, and you smile. These are very tractable <IT>Gent.</IT> and hot-mettal'd; the har&rehy;der you stave them off, the fiercer they come on; the longer you hold them in play, the more will the <IT>prize</IT> be valued. This <IT>Madam</IT> is like a <IT>Politique Merchant</IT>, in our <IT>Commonwealth</IT>, and (if she be <PB

<P>My right hand would forget it's cunning should the example of all women be left out, my Lady <IT>Cullen</IT>, who in my Lord <IT>Riche's</IT> time was called my Lady <IT>Mary Cokaine</IT>, but varied her name when she began to teach Souldiers how to order the <IT>Pike</IT>. This <IT>silken-Granado</IT> hath blown up ma&rehy;ny a Garrison; for she ever <IT>fired well</IT>, wounded one <IT>Captain</IT> so that he lies in still, fell furiously on many others; and she has one <IT>Trick</IT>, that if you will not charge her, she'll charge you. Upon these tearms she met with a <IT>Colonell</IT>, one <IT>Stam&rehy;ford</IT>, whom when she had worn out one way as well as the other, she <IT>cashired</IT> him for want of <IT>pay</IT>, and took over his head <IT>George Porter</IT>, whose de&rehy;signe is to <IT>Levell</IT> her even with his owne principles. On the other side, she, having smelt his <IT>Plot</IT>, be&rehy;gins to grow weary of him, and plies the <IT>Counter&rehy;mine</IT>, but knowes not how to admit another, be&rehy;cause his <IT>Mother</IT> and his <IT>Wife</IT> stand <IT>Sentinell</IT> at her elbow. &horfill; It is intended, the life of this <IT>Lady</IT> shall ere long come out in <IT>Folio</IT>.</P>
<P>But 'tis an old <IT>Proverb</IT>, there can be no <IT>Play</IT> with&rehy;out a <IT>Foole</IT> in it. Alas poore Master <IT>Pembroke</IT>, who twelve months since was an <IT>Earl</IT>, but now being made a poore <IT>Commoner</IT> of <IT>England</IT>, hath rallied his <IT>forces</IT>, and finds it necessary to cashire <PB
N="15">my Lady <IT>May</IT>, my Lady <IT>Banbury</IT>, and my Lady <IT>Crompton</IT>, having been very angry with her, and desired her to resolve him of this Question, <NOTE

<P><IT>'Zounds</IT>, we are now in a Godly Family; and they that are the only people in the world, that know to order <IT>Women</IT>: for, the <IT>Father</IT> keeps two wives and a Concubine, as prisoners.

As for <IT>Jack</IT>, with his <IT>Spider's shanks</IT>, his <IT>Mistresse</IT> is not arived to fourteene yet, or else he would take the same course as his Brothers, for feare she should suck of the same <IT>Teat</IT> with her <IT>Mother</IT>.</P>

My <IT>Lord</IT> and she are parted since, but how, it is not known; only we heare of great resolutions against <IT>Teeming</IT>, professing shee will venture no more for Children: but we fear she must have one more to please my Lord <IT>Broncker</IT>.</P>
