<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE <SC>Life</SC> and <SC>Actions</SC> OF <IT>GUSTAVUS VASA,</IT> <SC>Deliverer</SC> of his <SC>Country</SC>.</HEAD>
<P>&Uic;Nderstanding a <IT>Play</IT> call'd <IT>Gustavus Vasa</IT>, was preparing for the Publick, I had the Curiosity to attend a Friend of the Au&rehy;thor's to the Rehearsal at the <IT>Theatre-Royal</IT> in <IT>Drury&rehy;Lane</IT>: But as Praise often raises to Adulation, I was in some Fear (like a Lover's warm Description of the Charms of his Mistress) it would fall short to one prepared for the strictest Examination: I went, not in the least prejudiced in its Favour, but was <CORR
SIC="exremely">extremely</CORR> surprised to find my self so agreeably Disappointed.
</P><P>There is not only what the Actors call Business in it, but a Nobleness of Stile and Thoughts, that has in my Opinion rank'd it in the Class of the best <IT>Tragick Authors</IT>.</P>
<P>I therefore went Home, full of the noble Ideas the Piece had stamp'd on my Mind, and form'd a Reso&rehy;lution of extracting from the <IT>Best Historians</IT>, the <IT>Life</IT> and <IT>History</IT> of this <IT>Northern Hero, GUSTAVUS VASA</IT>.</P>
<PB N="4"><P>THE <IT>Kingdom</IT> of <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Sweden</IT>, which contains a great Part of the old <IT>Scandinavia</IT>, is one of the most powerful <IT>Kingdoms</IT> in the <IT>North</IT>, for many Ages united to the Crown of <IT>Denmark</IT>. The Air is very cold, tho' far more fer&rehy;til than any of the other <IT>Northern Kingdoms</IT>. It equals <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT> in its Extent. Their chief Export is <IT>Malt, Barley, Brass, Lead, Steel, Iron, Buck</IT> and <IT>Great Hides, Black Cattle</IT>, Variety of <IT>Rich Furs, Tar, Honey, Oaks</IT> and <IT>Deals</IT>, and the <IT>finest Copper</IT> in the <IT>World</IT>. The Inhabitants, healthful and strong, (the Women more prolifick than any of its bordering Nations) and so industrious, that there is seldom a Beggar seen among them. This Kingdom was converted to Christi&rehy;anity in the Year 816, by <IT>Ansgarus</IT> Bishop of <IT>Bremen</IT> (a City of the <IT>Lower-Saxony</IT>.) <IT>Norway</IT> and <IT>Lapland</IT> bound its <IT>North, Russia</IT> and <IT>Moscovy</IT> the <IT>East</IT>; the <IT>South</IT> by the <IT>Baltick Sea</IT>, and the <IT>West, Den&rehy;mark</IT>. This <IT>Kingdom</IT> was the Country of the <IT>Goths</IT>, who made a <IT>Breach</IT> in the <IT>Roman Empire</IT>, the <IT>fourth Century</IT>, to let in most of the <IT>Northerns</IT> that <IT>now</IT> inhabit it. The <IT>Swedes</IT> are well made, and are Warriors from their Infancy; they are patient in Hunger and Want, having more <IT>Courage</IT> than <IT>Industry</IT>, taking more Pleasure and Delight to polish their Arms, than improve their Commerce; leaving to their Women the Cares of the Houshold. It extends from <IT>South</IT> to <IT>North</IT>, to the 55th Degree of <IT>Latitude</IT> to the 70th, and consequently must feel the Cold in its utmost Rigour. The Winter Season reigns near nine Months of the Year; and in their three Summer Months their <IT>Tillage</IT>, their <IT>Harvest</IT>, their <IT>Fruit</IT> and <IT>Vegetables</IT> come to their Perfection. But in the nine Winter Months, Providence has been kind to them, by allowing them a serene Sky and a pure Air; and the light of the Moon, which is very seldom obscur'd, makes it almost as commodious in Tra&rehy;velling by <IT>Night</IT>, as by <IT>Day</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Sweden</IT> was an <IT>Elective King&rehy;dom</IT> till the <IT>fourteenth Century</IT>, and by that Right, the <IT>Swedes</IT>, often <IT>depos'd</IT> their Monarchs when they had the least view of infringing their Liberties.
</P><P>The <IT>King</IT> could neither raise <IT>Money</IT>, declare <IT>Peace</IT> or <IT>War</IT>, without the <IT>Consent</IT> of the Senate, nor <IT>build</IT> any <IT>Fortifications</IT>. The Representatives of the <IT>King&rehy;dom</IT> were the <IT>Nobility</IT>, the <IT>Bishops</IT>, and <IT>Deputies</IT> of <IT>Towns</IT>, nay even the <IT>Peasants</IT> were at last <IT>incorporated</IT> into that <IT>Assembly</IT>.</P>
<P>About the Year 1692, this <IT>warlike Nation</IT> that had conquered <IT>Rome</IT> above <IT>thirteen Centuries</IT> past, was <IT>sub&rehy;du'd</IT> and brought under <IT>Subjection</IT> by a <IT>Woman, Margaret</IT> Queen of <IT>Denmark</IT> and <IT>Norway</IT>: But after the Death of that heroick Queen, <IT>Sweden</IT> often felt the Shocks of <IT>Civil Wars</IT>, alternately shook off the <IT>Danish <PB
N="5">Yoke</IT>, and submitted to it, was sometimes <IT>govern'd</IT> by <IT>Kings</IT>, and somtimes by <IT>Administrators</IT>.</P>
<P>About the Year 1520, this <IT>Kingdom</IT> was oppress'd by two terrible <IT>Tyrants, Christiern</IT>, the Second <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT>, a Monster in Nature, cloath'd in every Vice, and <IT>Trollio, Archbishop</IT> of <NOTE
N="(2)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Upsal</IT> was <IT>formerly</IT> the <IT>Capital</IT> of <IT>Sweden</IT>, in the Province of <IT>Upland</IT>, constituted an <IT>Archbishop's See</IT> by <IT>Eugenius</IT> the <IT>Third Pope</IT> of <IT>Rome</IT>. It is seated on the River <IT>Sala</IT>. It was for many Ages the <IT>Seat</IT> of their <IT>Kings</IT>, and from its former Regard the Kings receive their Regalities there, and are crown'd by the <IT>Archbishop</IT> of that Place; 'tis also an <IT>University</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Upsal</IT>. These two well&rehy;match'd Tyrants agreed to seize in one Day at <NOTE
N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Stockholm</IT>. The now <IT>Capital</IT> of all <IT>Sweden</IT>, (and has been so two Centuries and upward) is a large, noble City (tho' formerly a poor Place) Seated upon the Bottom of the Lake <IT>Meler</IT>, that falls into the Sea near this <IT>City</IT>: It is almost surrounded by Rocks, and strongly fortified, its Situation is something like that of <IT>Venice</IT>, upon <IT>six Islands</IT> join'd to each other by six wooden Bridges, with two large <IT>Suburbs</IT>, one to the <IT>North</IT>, and the other to the <IT>South</IT>. In their <IT>Cathedral</IT> are depo&rehy;sited two of their Kings (the rest being interr'd at <IT>Upsal</IT>.) Its Castle is large but not strong, and the <IT>Harbour</IT> one of the safest in the <IT>North</IT>, for once enter'd, you are intirely land-lock'd, and defended by the circumjacent Rocks, from all Gust, or Flaws of Wind.</NOTE> <IT>Stockholm</IT>, the <IT>Magistrates</IT>, the <IT>Consuls</IT>, and ninety four <IT>Senators</IT>, who all suffer'd Death, under Pretence that they were excommunicated by the <IT>Pope</IT>, for defend&rehy;ing the Rights of the <IT>State</IT> against the <IT>Archbishop</IT>, whilst these two Tyrants were employed in the ut&rehy;most Exercise of arbitrary Power.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus Vasa</IT>, (the Subject of our <IT>noble Drama</IT>) was lineally descended from their famous King <IT>Canutson</IT>, he was one of those extraordinary Genius's, who are so rarely form'd by Nature, to govern Mankind; his Person was amiable, his Air majestick, his Elo&rehy;quence, which receiv'd an additional Force from the agreeableness of his manner, was the more persuasive, as it was less artful. His enterprizing Genius form'd such noble Designs, as might appear rash to vul&rehy;gar Souls, he was intrepid with Prudence, calm in an Age of Cruelty and Horror, and as virtuous, as the most guiltless.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>The first Appearance of this great Hero, was un&rehy;der <IT>Steno</IT>, the Administrator (so the Chief was call&rehy;ed.) His force of Eloquence, and Reason, insensibly crept into the Heart of <IT>Steno</IT>; by <IT>Gustavus's</IT> persua&rehy;sion, he arm'd the Peasants with Fire-arms, who be&rehy;fore that time us'd no Instruments of War, but Bows and Arrows. The first Proof of his invincible Cou&rehy;rage, was at the Battle of <NOTE
N="(4)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Wedel</IT> a strong, but small Fortification in <IT>Sweden</IT>, facing the <IT>Baltick</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Wedel</IT>, against <IT>Christiern's</IT> Army. He was the first that broke their Ranks at the Head of <IT>Steno's</IT> Horse, and to his visi&rehy;ble Courage and Conduct the Victory was owing. Most of the <IT>Danes</IT> were cut to Pieces, and the re&rehy;maining few made a disorderly retreat to their Vessel, not thinking themselves secure till their safe arrival in <IT>Denmark</IT>.
</P><P>After this Success, <IT>Gustavus</IT> led his victorious Troops to beleaguer <NOTE
N="(5)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Steque</IT>, a strong <IT>Castle</IT> in the <IT>Province of Upsal</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Steque</IT>, where the Archbishop was fortify'd. The <IT>Troops</IT> commanded by <IT>Gustavus</IT>, un&rehy;der the <IT>King</IT>, carry'd their Works to the <IT>Foot</IT> of the <IT>Wall</IT>, but the furious <IT>Priest</IT> defended the Place with the greatest Vigour, contrary to the opinion of the <IT>Garrison</IT>, who call'd for a <IT>Surrender</IT>, well knowing if they were taken by Storm, they wou'd be treated as <IT>Rebels</IT>, and <IT>Traitors</IT> to their <IT>Country</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Archbishop</IT>, finding no Persuasions wou'd pre&rehy;vail on the <IT>Garrison</IT> to defend the Place, desir'd to treat with the <IT>Administrator</IT> at his Tent, demanding <IT>Gustavus</IT> shou'd enter the <IT>Castle</IT> as <IT>Hostage</IT>, which was comply'd with, but fearing the <IT>Administrator</IT> wou'd treat him as a <IT>Rebel</IT>, he left order with some of his <IT>Adherents</IT>, to hang up <IT>Gustavus</IT> over the Bat&rehy;tlements of the <IT>Castle</IT>, if they saw he was detain'd as Prisoner: But <IT>Steno</IT> declaring he wou'd leave his <IT>Trial</IT> to the <IT>Senate</IT>, (the Priest imagin'd he had Friends enough to vote him not Guilty) the <IT>Castle</IT> was sur&rehy;render'd, and he went on his Journey to <IT>Stockholm</IT>, <PB
N="7">with such a proud <IT>State</IT> and <IT>Equipage</IT>, as if he had tri&rehy;umph'd over the Enemies of his Country, imagining the dread of <IT>Christiern</IT> wou'd prevent even his <IT>Trial</IT>; but he was much deceiv'd, for on his arrival, the <IT>Se&rehy;nate</IT> proceeded to his Trial with the utmost Vigour, and he was condemn'd to retire from the World, to lead a private Life, first forfeiting all his Dig&rehy;nities.</P>
<P>In the Month of <IT>May</IT> (1518) <IT>Christiern</IT> prepar'd for another Invasion of <IT>Sweden</IT>, and in <IT>June</IT> besieg'd <IT>Stockholm</IT>, but the <IT>Garrison</IT> and <IT>Inhabitants</IT> having an intire hatred for the <IT>Danes</IT>, resolv'd to defend it to the last Man. Every Foot of Ground the Besiegers gain&rehy;ed, cost 'em the Lives of Hundreds.</P>
<P>The <IT>Administrator</IT>, having assembled and disciplin'd his Troops, proceeded with long Marches, to attack the <IT>Army</IT> of the King of <IT>Denmark</IT>, who fearing, be&rehy;tween the <IT>Army</IT> and the <IT>City</IT>, he shou'd be over&rehy;power'd, rais'd the Siege <CORR
SIC="precipantly">precipitantly</CORR>, and march'd towards his Ships, but <IT>Gustavus</IT> with the <IT>Swedish Horse</IT>, fell like Thunder on their Rear, kill'd the third part of the Besiegers, pressing many into the Sea, who perished there; made above three hundred of their Officers Prisoners, who oppos'd <IT>him</IT> to give their <IT>King</IT> time to escape: Yet this fatal Retreat, was not the last of their Misfortunes, the very Winds prov'd their Enemies, blowing full three Months against 'em, which prevented their sailing to <IT>Denmark</IT>, and their Provisions falling short, they were forc'd thro' Necessity to land in <IT>Troops</IT> for <IT>Subsistance</IT>. But their <IT>Guardian Angel Gustavus</IT>, watching for the <IT>good</IT> of <IT>Sweden</IT>, was ever among those that landed, and re&rehy;liev'd the Wants of many of the <IT>Danes</IT>, by Death with his Sword, who flew before him like fearful Pi&rehy;geons from the Hawk.</P>
<P><IT>Christiern</IT> being drove to the utmost Necessity sought for a Truce, and beg'd for an Interview with the <IT>Ad&rehy;ministrator</IT>, on board his Fleet, but the <IT>Senate</IT> wou'd not agree to it, well knowing the Dissimulation of <PB
N="8">the <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT>, who, indeed intended, if he had prevailed on him to come on Board to have made him Prisoner.</P>
<P>Failing in this, he thought of <IT>another</IT> Stratagem: he imagin'd if he cou'd get <IT>Gustavus</IT>, and some other young Lords into his Custody, it wou'd prevail up&rehy;on <IT>Steno</IT>, to come to any Terms, or if he refus'd, wou'd at least cause Disturbances and Factions among the Friends of these Noblemen, and draw him to his Ends that way. He therefore agreed to meet <IT>Steno</IT>, and the <IT>Senate</IT> in <IT>Stockholm</IT>, upon Condition, <IT>Gustavus</IT>, and six young Lords that he wou'd name, shou'd remain on Board his Ship as Hostages.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT>, and the young Lords that were chose by the <IT>Danish King</IT>, cheerfully comply'd; when they came to the Shore-side, the <IT>Admiral</IT> of the <IT>Danes</IT>, attended by several Officers, landed to salute 'em, while they were in Conference, the Hostages were surrounded with Soldiers disguis'd like Mariners. In the mean time, the King of <IT>Denmark</IT> descending to his Boat, in order to come on Shore, the Admiral invited <IT>Gustavus</IT> and the rest on board his Boat, to meet his <IT>Master</IT>, and salute him.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT>, tho' too late, perceiv'd the Treachery against the Law of Nations, yet went with his Com&rehy;panions cheerfully into the Admiral's Boat, well know&rehy;ing Resistance wou'd be vain. When they came on Board, they were brought before the King, who or&rehy;der'd them to be disarm'd, and sent a Message to <IT>Steno</IT>, who declar'd in his Master's Name, their Heads shou'd be struck off, unless the <IT>Archbishop</IT> was restor'd to his former Dignities, <IT>&amp;c. Steno</IT>, and the <IT>Swedes</IT> were so incens'd at this Indignity and Treachery that they hurry'd on Board their small Vessels with their Arms, either to recover their Hostages, or die in the Attempt. But <IT>Christiern</IT>, with the help of fair Wind, that rose that Morning, was sail'd for <IT>Denmark</IT>, and the generous <IT>Swedes</IT> were oblig'd to return regretting with Tears the loss of <IT>Gustavus</IT> and his Companions.</P>
<PB N="9"><P>The <IT>Danish King</IT> left no means unattempted to cor&rehy;rupt the Fidelity of <IT>Gustavus</IT> and his <IT>Companions</IT>, but in vain. Their Resolution and Constancy had almost cost 'em their Lives, for dreading the Courage and Indignation of <IT>Gustavus</IT>, if he shou'd be releas'd, gave secret Orders to put <IT>him</IT> and the other <IT>Lords</IT> to Death. But the <IT>Dane</IT> who receiv'd that Order, ab&rehy;horring so barbarous a Proceeding, or fearing, per&rehy;haps, the Law of <IT>Retaliation</IT> if by the Chance of War he shou'd fall into the Hands of the <IT>Swedes</IT>, took the liberty to tell his Master, that the Death of those il&rehy;lustrious Captives, wou'd be prejudicial to his Inte&rehy;rest, but by detaining 'em Prisoners, he might keep their <IT>Relations</IT> in <IT>awe</IT>. These Considerations made so great an Impression on the <IT>Tyrant</IT>, that he con&rehy;tented himself with their Imprisonment in the Castle of <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>Copenhagen</IT> is the Principal City of <IT>Denmark</IT>, in the <IT>Isle</IT> of <IT>Zee&rehy;land</IT>, great and well fortified; it is built upon a Plain near the Sea where is form'd a safe large and noble Harbour, commanded by a very strong Castle, over against <IT>Schonen</IT> (a <IT>Province</IT> in <IT>Sweden</IT>) on the <IT>Baltick</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Copenhagen</IT>, where they were so cruelly us'd by his Order, that some of 'em expir'd under their Tor&rehy;ments.
</P><P>But <IT>Eric Banner</IT> one the <IT>Lords</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT>, and a near Relation to <IT>Gustavus</IT>, who admir'd his Vir&rehy;tues, fearing his Life, won so much upon <IT>Christiern</IT> (by insinuating he did not doubt but he shou'd work him to his Interest) that he gave him to his Pro&rehy;tection, on Condition if he made his Escape, he should pay for his Ransom six thousand Crowns of Gold (in those Times a great Sum.) The <IT>noble Banner</IT> did not think any Condition too hard to save his illu&rehy;strious Kinsman. But notwithstanding the generous Treatment from him, <IT>Gustavus</IT> consider'd he was still a Slave, and cou'd not bear the Thoughts of being ab&rehy;sent from the approaching War.</P>
<P><IT>Christiern</IT> breath'd nothing but Destruction against <IT>Sweden</IT>, but his Coffers being low, he seiz'd a Mil&rehy;lion of <IT>Florins</IT> that the <IT>Legate Arumboldi</IT>, had gather<PB
N="10">ed from the <IT>Sale</IT> of <IT>Indulgencies</IT> in <IT>Sweden</IT>, and <IT>Den&rehy;mark</IT>, with the pretext, that the <IT>Legate</IT> held Corre&rehy;spondence with his Enemies in <IT>Sweden</IT>.</P>
<P>With this <IT>holy Mony</IT>, and much more drain'd from his unconsenting Subjects, he levy'd Men at home, and foreign Auxiliaries, with these he once more in&rehy;vaded <IT>Sweden</IT> with Fire and Sword, and other un&rehy;grateful attendances of War, under the conduct of <IT>Otho Crumpein</IT>, a valiant and experienc'd General. But we shall leave him to his Successes, and follow the illustrious <IT>Gustavus Vasa</IT>, or, <IT>the Deliverer of his Country</IT> that gives <IT>Title</IT> to our <IT>Play</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> was terribly alarm'd at the <IT>Ruin</IT> of his Country, (that had surrender'd to the King of <IT>Den&rehy;mark</IT>, thro' the Success of his Arms under the con&rehy;duct of victorious <IT>Otho</IT>, with the Death of <IT>Steno</IT>, (the <IT>Administrator</IT>, who lost his Life in a Battle with <IT>Otho</IT>.) His Restraint became insupportable to him: The passionate Love to his dear Country made him forget the affable Kindness of his generous Host, therefore he resolv'd upon his Escape, and in the <IT>Month</IT> of <IT>De&rehy;cember</IT> (1519) under the pretence of Hunting (as he often did) he went out of the Castle where he was ne&rehy;ver confin'd, and in the Habit of a Peasant arriv'd in two Days, (thro' Woods and the most secret By&rehy;ways) at <IT>Flensburgh</IT>, <NOTE
N="(6)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Flensburgh</IT>, a <IT>City</IT> in <IT>Denmark</IT> on the <IT>Baltick</IT> Sea, in the <IT>Dukedom</IT> of <IT>Sleswick</IT>, it is a small, but strong City, built on very high Hills, with a safe and large Haven, defended by a strong Castle.</NOTE> at that Place he hir'd himself as a Driver of Oxen, by which Device, he got clear of the <IT>Danish Dominions</IT>, and arriv'd safe at <NOTE
N="(7)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Lubeck</IT>, a great and opulent City of the <IT>Lower Saxony</IT>, in the <IT>Dukedom</IT> of <IT>Holstein</IT>. It is one of the Principal <IT>Hans Towns</IT>, about three Miles from the <IT>Baltick</IT>, upon the <IT>River Trave</IT>. In <IT>this City</IT> the Peace was concluded between the <IT>Emperor</IT>, and <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT> in the Year (1629).</NOTE> <IT>Lubeck</IT>. But all his Precaution cou'd not hide him from the searching Eyes of <IT>Banner</IT>, who found him at <IT>Lubeck</IT>. But <IT>Gustavus</IT> by his Eloquence convinc'd <IT>Banner</IT> that his seeming Ingratitude, was fatal Necessity, dismis<PB
N="11">sed him with Promises of a grateful Memory for his noble Treatment.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> thro' many Difficulties, set his Foot once more on his dear native Country, full of civil Wounds, and with her loss of Liberty almost expiring. He discover'd himself to the <IT>Governor</IT> of <NOTE
N="(8)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Calmar</IT>, a strong City of <IT>Sweden</IT> upon the <IT>Baltick</IT>. It is the Port where the <IT>Swedes</IT> generally take Shipping for <IT>Germany</IT>. The <IT>Citadel</IT> is accounted the strongest in all <IT>Sweden</IT>. It stands over&rehy;against the <IT>Isle</IT> of <IT>Ocland</IT>, (an Island in the <IT>Baltick</IT> belonging to <IT>Sweden</IT>, the Straits between this <IT>Island</IT> and <IT>Calmar</IT>, is call'd <IT>Cal&rehy;mar sund</IT>.) This City was taken, and all the Garrison, and Inhabi&rehy;tants put to the Sword by <IT>Christian</IT> the fourth <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT> in 1611, all but those who retir'd into the Citadel; but return'd to the Great <IT>Gustavus Adolphus</IT> by <IT>Treaty</IT> in (1613).</NOTE> <IT>Calmar</IT>, a <IT>German</IT> Garrison that held out for the <IT>Swedes</IT>, but his usual Eloquence was not heard by those <IT>mercenary</IT> Men, but they threaten'd to deliver him up to the <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT>, if they once admitted him within their Walls. Unprospering here, he was filled with <IT>Trouble</IT> and <IT>Vexation</IT>, and being inform'd there were several <IT>Parties</IT> of the <IT>Danes</IT> in quest of him, and dread of falling into the Hands of the relentless <IT>Christiern</IT>, he was oblig'd to conceal himself in a Cart loaded with Straw, and by that means was carry'd thro' the <IT>Danish Camp</IT> in safety to <NOTE
N="(9)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Sudermania</IT>, a <IT>City</IT> and <IT>Castle</IT> that gives Name to the Province.

It gives the <IT>Title</IT> of <IT>Duke</IT> to the Royal Family of <IT>Sweden</IT>. It is call'd by the Natives <IT>Soder&rehy;manland</IT>.</NOTE><NOTE
PLACE="none" RESP="compiler">original footnote anchor is missing</NOTE> <IT>Sudermania</IT>, a Castle be&rehy;longing to his Father, <IT>Eric Vasa</IT>. From that Place, he sent Circular Letters to his Friends, intreating 'em to summon their Vassals, and Followers, to have one more Struggle for their Lives, and (what was more precious to him,) their Liberties. But was discourag'd in the Attempt even by his <IT>own</IT> Rela&rehy;tions.</P>
<P>This giving up their Liberty, fill'd his Mind with <IT>Disdain, Contempt</IT>, and <IT>Rage</IT>, therefore he apply'd himself to the hardy <IT>Peasants</IT>, but he found with un<PB
N="12">consolable Regret, that even these that were so tena&rehy;cious of their Liberty, gave over all thoughts on that Subject.</P>
<P>He then form'd a Resolution at all Hazards, to get within the Walls of <IT>Stockholm</IT>, whose Garrison held out that City for the Widow of their diseas'd Administrator the brave <IT>Steno</IT>. He travell'd mostly by Night, but the <IT>Danes</IT> having notice of his Jour&rehy;ney, pursu'd him so close, that they came to the Place he had left an Hour before: Finding his De&rehy;signs impracticable, he return'd by another Road, and took Shelter in a <IT>Convent</IT> of <IT>Carthusians</IT>, founded by his <IT>Ancestors</IT>; but the lazy Monks, fat'ning in Ease and Plenty, turn'd him out &horfill; He then took Sanctuary with a Peasant formerly his Father's Servant. From thence, he once more by Letters to several of the No&rehy;bility, endeavour'd to rouze their sleeping Courage, and wake in their Souls the love of Liberty, but the Terror of the <IT>Danes</IT> kept 'em in awe. What had the Heroick <IT>Gustavus</IT> to do now, but patently to wait in Obscurity some <IT>happy</IT> Revolution.</P>
<P>The <IT>Danish King</IT> enter'd <IT>Sweden</IT> in the Spring (1525) confirm'd the Treaty of <IT>Upsal</IT>, and by Bribery prevail'd on the Governor of <IT>Calmar</IT> to surrender that impor&rehy;tant Place. Also sent to <IT>Steno's</IT> illustrious Widow, then residing at <IT>Stockholm</IT>, to surrender that City, but she return'd him his Heroic Answer, That she wou'd sooner suffer Death than surrender to the <IT>Enemy</IT> of her <IT>Country</IT>.</P>
<P>This Answer fix'd <IT>Christiern's</IT> Resolution of be&rehy;leaguering that City. But the <IT>Garrison</IT> animated by her Presence, made a noble Defence: Yet Necessity began to appear with all its frightful Appendages, and that great Princess was at last oblig'd to accept of the Terms, tho' not altogether disadvantageous to her.</P>
<P><IT>King Christiern</IT>, about this time surrender'd his Heart to the Charms of a Woman neither young nor hand&rehy;some, but had so much cunning and wit to manage <PB
N="13">him, that she might be well call'd his chief Minister of State, disposing of <IT>Places</IT> and <IT>Offices</IT> as she pleas'd, to the <IT>Scandal</IT> of the <IT>King</IT>, and <IT>hurt</IT> of his <IT>Subjects</IT>; and by the Advice of <IT>her</IT>, and the <IT>Archbishop of Upsal</IT>, was brought on that horrid Massacre of the <IT>Bishops</IT>, the <IT>Senators</IT>, and most of the <IT>Nobility</IT>: But we will forget such an human Barbarity, and go in pursuit of our Illustrious Hero <IT>Gustavus</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> from his Secret Retreat, look'd round to seek for what he wish'd, and being inform'd of the Massacre, had hopes the <IT>Subject</IT> wou'd not long <IT>bear</IT> with such an inhuman Monster. <IT>Christiern</IT> had <IT>pro&rehy;scrib'd</IT> him, with a large Reward, therefore he did not think himself safe surrounded by <IT>Danes</IT>; besides the Loss of most of those <IT>Friends</IT> by the <IT>Massacre</IT> of the barbarous <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT>, his Father being one, gave him inexpressible Sorrow. Therefore he re&rehy;solv'd to retire to the almost inaccessible Mountains of <NOTE
N="(10)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Dalecarlia</IT>, a great <IT>Province</IT> in the <IT>Kingdom</IT> of <IT>Sweden</IT> near the Mountains of <IT>Savona</IT>, and <IT>Norway</IT>, which bound it on the <IT>West</IT>, on the <IT>North, Helsinga; Gestricia</IT> on the <IT>East</IT>, and <IT>Verlemandia</IT> on the <IT>South</IT>, a large Country, but it has not either a good City or Town, on&rehy;ly Villages or Hamlets. This <IT>Province</IT> takes its Name from the <IT>River</IT> that runs through the Country, and is call'd <IT>Dalecarle</IT>, which is one of the largest Streams in the whole Kingdom of <IT>Sweden</IT>. This <IT>Province</IT> being so far from the <IT>Capital</IT> of <IT>Sweden</IT>, was <IT>governed</IT> by the Head of the <IT>Peasants</IT>, whose Habitations were chiefly on the Banks of the River <IT>Dalecarle</IT>, or the Skirts of their large <IT>Forests, Lakes</IT>, or other <IT>Streams</IT> that empty'd themselves into the River <IT>Dalecarle</IT>. The Elders of each Village were <IT>Captains</IT>, or <IT>Judges</IT> &amp;c..</NOTE> <IT>Dalecarlia</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Thus</IT> shrouded Excellence in the Disguise of a <IT>Pea&rehy;sant</IT>, pursu'd his uncomfortable Journey to these dreary Dwellings, attended only with a Guide that knew the Course of the Country, where meeting with many Difficulties, he arriv'd safe at that part of those Moun&rehy;tains, call'd by the Inhabitants <IT>Daalfield</IT>, a simple Vil&rehy;lage in <IT>Dalecarlia</IT>, bordering on the <IT>Copper Mines</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>From this Place, our Author of the Play begins his Scene</IT>.</P>
<PB N="14"><P>The Inhabitants of these <IT>Mines</IT>, and <IT>Mountains</IT>, set so high a Value on their Liberty, that no <IT>King</IT>, or <IT>Substitute</IT>, ever enter'd their Country without giving <IT>Pledges</IT> to the <IT>People</IT> to maintain their Rights and Pri&rehy;vileges; even the Tribute they paid in Token of Alle&rehy;giance, was a <IT>small Number</IT> of <IT>Furs</IT>. He was no sooner enter'd this <IT>mountainous Country</IT>, but his treacherous Guide forsook him and at the same time <IT>robbed</IT> him of what little Money he had. This brought our <IT>Hero</IT> to such <IT>Distress</IT>, that Necessity obliged him to enter as a Servant in the <IT>Copper Mines</IT>, where he earn'd his <IT>Subsistence</IT> by the <IT>Sweat</IT> of his <IT>Brows</IT>. But notwith&rehy;standing his Care to conceal himself, he was found out by a <IT>Woman</IT> of the <IT>Village</IT> where he lodg'd, by observing a silk Robe embroidered with Gold, in his Apartment where he lay. Women can't keep Secrets, therefore this News came to the <IT>Chief</IT> of the <IT>Village</IT>: This <IT>Chief</IT> had been with <IT>Gustavus</IT> in his Youth, at the <IT>University</IT> of <IT>Upsal</IT>, therefore as soon as he saw him, he knew him for <IT>Gustavus</IT>. He offer'd him the Accommodation of his House, which our <IT>Hero</IT> ac&rehy;cepted of, in the Hope he had of prevailing with him to assert his Country's Cause. This <IT>Chief's</IT> Dis&rehy;course often tended that Way, but when <IT>Gustavus</IT> de&rehy;clared himself, he was sunk into base <IT>Fears</IT> and <IT>Tremblings</IT>. The <IT>Illustrious Wanderer</IT>, finding his Ex&rehy;pectations <IT>frustrated</IT>, left the <IT>timorous Chief</IT>, and jour&rehy;neying alone thro' the pathless Woods, arriv'd at the Residence of <IT>Peterson</IT>, a <IT>Gentleman</IT> he was acquainted with in the Army.
</P><P>This brave Spirit in appearance soon was rouz'd by the Eloquence of his noble Guest, but his base In&rehy;tention was to make his Court to the King of <IT>Den&rehy;mark</IT>, by betraying the Laws of Hospitality in sur&rehy;rendring his <IT>Illustrious Guest</IT>. He gave notice to one of the <IT>Danish</IT> Officers, who surrounded the House, but <IT>Gustavus</IT>, the Night before (by the means of the Traitor's Wife, inspir'd with Pity) made his Escape, where by her Directions, he arriv'd at a <IT>Curate's</IT> House, <PB
N="15">who was a sincere <IT>Lover</IT> of his <IT>Country</IT>, he conceal'd <IT>Gustavus</IT> in his <IT>Church</IT> unknown to any one Person, for fear of a Discovery.</P>
<P>This generous Curate, advis'd him once more to apply to the <IT>Peasants</IT>, at their <IT>Christmas</IT> Meeting, where the neighbouring <IT>Villagers</IT> assembled to exa&rehy;mine their <IT>martial Power</IT>. He met the <IT>Peasants</IT> on the Day appointed (dress'd according to his Quality) who had Notice of his Visit. When he appear'd, his noble Air, and usual Eloquence penetrated the Hearts of these <IT>valiant Rusticks</IT> in his Behalf, who resolv'd to revenge the <IT>Death</IT> of their <IT>Nobles</IT> and <IT>Senate</IT>.</P>
<P>Our <IT>Hero</IT> took 'em while their Souls were warm, and led them by secret Paths in the Night to the <IT>Ca&rehy;stle</IT> of the <IT>Province</IT> which they took by <IT>Scalade</IT>, and in their first Fury, put the <IT>Garrison</IT> to the <IT>Sword</IT>, all but the <IT>Governor</IT>, whom <IT>Gustavus</IT> saved with much Dif&rehy;ficulty.

<PB N="16"><P>The News of this <IT>Revolt</IT> surpriz'd the <IT>Viceroy</IT> of <IT>Sweden</IT>, who was ill prepar'd for the Field. He ac&rehy;quainted the <IT>King</IT> of <IT>Denmark</IT> with this disagreeable News, and in the mean time summon'd his Army, to oppose this unlook'd for Torrent. <IT>Christiern</IT> the King of <IT>Denmark</IT>, began to be more tyrannous, if possible, than ever, exercising his Cruelty upon his own Sub&rehy;jects, and not being able to send Succours over to <IT>Sweden</IT>, he writ to his <IT>Viceroy</IT> to bring the Rebels as he call'd them to Reason. Threatning <IT>Gustavus</IT> at the same time, the Blood of his <IT>Mother</IT> and <IT>Sisters</IT> should be shed with the most exquisite Torments, if he did not abandon the Interest of <IT>Sweden</IT>.
</P><P>But <IT>Gustavus</IT>, despising his Threats, march'd on with his victorious Army, now increas'd to fifteen thousand Men, all resolv'd from the Ardour of their General to <IT>conquer</IT>, or <IT>die</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Viceroy</IT> advanc'd to the River <IT>Brunebec</IT> to oppose the Passage of <IT>Gustavus</IT>, but as soon as the Avenger of his Country appear'd on the other Side at the Head of his Horse, he abandon'd his Post, and took to a shameful Flight, leaving Part of his Army to garrison <NOTE

He intrench'd himself near the Chapel of <IT>Stolaus</IT> with three thousand Foot only (having sent his Horse, and the remaining Part of his Foot, in order to execute a Stratagem) with all the Care and Dili&rehy;gence of a General that fears being attack'd, which the <IT>Danes</IT> perceiving, and observing the Smallness of their Number, <IT>sally'd</IT> and charg'd him with their Horse. <IT>Gustavus</IT> pretending to fly, he drew the pur&rehy;suing <IT>Danes</IT>, into the Trap that was set for 'em. In short, the <IT>Danes</IT> were routed, and the City taken, by the <IT>Conduct</IT>, and <IT>Valour</IT> of the <IT>invincible Gustavus</IT>. <PB
N="17">But all had like to have been lost, by the Drunken&rehy;ness of the <IT>Dalecarlians</IT>, who in plundering the City, found large quantities of Wine and Brandy, their be&rehy;loved Liquors, that they were almost all bury'd in Drunkenness.</P>
<P>The Captain of the <IT>Citadel</IT> perceiving their Disor&rehy;der, sally'd upon 'em, putting great Numbers to the Sword, and the <IT>City</IT> wou'd have been certainly <IT>re&rehy;taken</IT>, had not the valorous <IT>Gustavus</IT>, with a few Of&rehy;ficers barricaded a Street, while the drunken Soldiers were forced from the Cellars to oppose the Enemy, that fought boldly to <IT>regain</IT> the City.</P>
<P>The taking of <IT>Westeras</IT> seem'd to open the <IT>Gate</IT> to let in a <IT>total Revolution. Seventy Swedish</IT> Officers at one time came over to <IT>Gustavus</IT>, several Noble&rehy;men, among these was <IT>Aruide</IT>, a powerful Lord of <NOTE
PLACE="none" RESP="compiler">footnote anchor (17) here, but the footnote itself is missing</NOTE> <IT>Westgothland</IT>. In short, the Eyes of all <IT>Sweden</IT> seem'd to look upon <IT>Gustavus</IT> as their Deliverer.</P>
<P>When he had block'd up the <IT>Citadel</IT> of <IT>Westeras</IT>, that the <IT>Garrison</IT> might not receive any Succours, he divided his Forces in three Bands, and sent 'em on several Expeditions, and by this means harrass'd the <IT>Danish Troops</IT>, who were oblig'd in the same manner to divide also.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> being inform'd, there was an Assembly of <IT>new</IT> Troops ready for his Command at <IT>Upsal</IT>, he im&rehy;mediately appear'd to head 'em. From that City, he sent an <IT>Envoy</IT> to the <IT>Consul</IT> of <IT>Lubeck</IT>, (who favour'd his Escape to <IT>Sweden</IT>) wherein his Letters gave a full account of his Success. These <IT>Mercantile</IT> Men were so wavering, that <IT>Gustavus's Envoy</IT> cou'd not fix 'em in any Point. But his Success with <IT>Stephen de Sassi</IT>, an old experienc'd <IT>German Colonel</IT>, a brave Soldier of Fortune, (who, for a Sum of Money down, and a promise of another certain, to land in <IT>Sweden</IT> with 1200 hardy Veterans the next <IT>August</IT> 1520) answer'd for the other failing Negotiation.</P>
<P><IT>Trolio</IT> the artful <IT>Bishop</IT> was the most formidable Enemy <IT>Gustavus</IT> had, thro' his numerous Relations, <PB
N="18">and Adherents in Posts and Power by his means. Therefore <IT>Gustavus</IT> sent two Religious of his Party to persuade him (if possible) with large Promises to join in his Interest. But the haughty Priest con&rehy;temn'd all Offers, and sent the two Canons in order to suffer Death at <IT>Stockholm</IT>, but by their Art, and giving an account of the Affairs of <IT>Gustavus</IT> they escap'd.</P>
<P><IT>Trolio</IT> being inform'd by the two Priests that the <IT>Da&rehy;lecarlians</IT> had left <IT>Gustavus</IT> to gather in their Harvest, and that he had but a hundred Horse, and six hun&rehy;dred Foot to defend <IT>Upsal</IT>, he resolv'd to attack him in that City, and march'd with such Secrecy, that he was within two Hours march before he had any notice of his Expedition; (<IT>Upsal</IT> being an unfor&rehy;tify'd City, and most of its Inhabitants being in <IT>Trolio's</IT> Interest, as being their Lord) he thought it Mad&rehy;ness to defend the Place, therefore he march'd with his Horse at the Rear of his Foot, to the Forest of <IT>Nostan</IT>. But the Archbishop entering the City im&rehy;mediately after him, and being advis'd of his hasty retreat, pursued him with all his Army. The sight of <IT>Trolio's</IT> numbers frighten'd <IT>Gustavus's</IT> small Force, who instantly abandon'd their General. In the Fight, the <IT>'Squire</IT> of <IT>Gustavus</IT> mounted on an unruly Horse run against him, and push'd his Master into the Wa&rehy;ter. But this Accident rais'd the Courage of our Hero, who with a small Number of his Guards, that wou'd never forsake him, sustain'd the Fight 'till his other Forces had gain'd the Shelter of the Forest, then maugre the Resistance of the Foe, he cut him&rehy;self a Passage thro' 'em with the loss of ten of his Guards only, and safely came up with his little Army.</P>
<P>This Success over our great <IT>Gustavus</IT>, elevated the <IT>Archbishop</IT> in such a manner, as if he had gain'd an intire Victory over all his Enemies. But this Danger only serv'd to animate <IT>Gustavus</IT> to a greater height, if possible, therefore he breath'd nothing but Revenge! <PB
N="19">and in order to it, he gather'd all the Force he cou'd assisted by <IT>Colonel de Sassi</IT>, with his 1200 <IT>Germans</IT>, just then arriv'd, however he conceal'd his Numbers, and intrench'd himself, as if he had no other Forces, than what he made his hasty Retreat out of <IT>Upsal</IT> with, which the Archbishop thought beneath his notice, and march'd onward in a Triumphal manner towards <IT>Stockholm. Gustavus</IT>, foreseeing this, appointed <IT>Ar&rehy;uide</IT> to conceal himself in a bordering Wood on the Road, with some part of his Army, which unex&rehy;pectedly fell furiously on the <IT>Archbishop</IT>, and destroy'd his Troops with great Slaughter. The haughty Priest to save his Men, thought to regain the City he had left, but the vigilant <IT>Gustavus</IT> intercepted his march, at the head of the <IT>Dalecarlians</IT> assisted by the <IT>Germans</IT>, and rushing like a Torrent from a steep Hill, bore down the sinking <IT>Danes</IT> before him, so that the <IT>Archbishop</IT> who had boasted to bring <IT>Gustavus</IT> to <IT>Stockholm</IT>, Dead, or a Prisoner, was compell'd to re&rehy;turn without him leaving behind five Parts of his Army dead, and wounded.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> immediately follow'd him, and set down before <IT>Stockholm</IT>, which so surpriz'd the Vice-roy and Archbishop, that they (not depending much up&rehy;on the Fidelity of the Citizens) retir'd to <IT>Denmark</IT>, where informing <IT>Christiern</IT> of the State of <IT>Sweden</IT>, that fell Tyrant, in revenge, sacrific'd the Lives of the Mother and Sister of <IT>Gustavus</IT>. This News stab'd the Heart of the brave <IT>Gustavus</IT>, and allay'd the Joy he felt for the <IT>Conquest</IT> of the best part of <IT>Sweden</IT>.</P>
<P>In <IT>November</IT> 1520, a Convention of the States met to think of some Form of Government, wherein <IT>Gu&rehy;stavus</IT> was unanimously chose <IT>Administrator</IT>.</P>
<P>This Hero having a Sanction for his Proceedings, was resolv'd to extend his Conquests, and not leave a single <IT>Dane</IT> in his <IT>Kingdom</IT>, and in order to pay his Troops, he (his Finances being in a low Condition) mortgag'd his whole private Patrimony.</P>
<PB N="20"><P><IT>Stockholm</IT> still continu'd in the Hands of the <IT>Danes</IT>, and as <IT>Norbi</IT> the <IT>Danish</IT> Admiral commanded the Sea, he fear'd it wou'd prove a difficult Undertaking, for want of Ships to oppose him.
</P><P><IT>Gustavus</IT> therefore sent once more his <IT>Secretary</IT> to <IT>Lubeck</IT> to solicite that <IT>Republick</IT> for a naval Force, who return'd with seventeen Ships of War, and four thousand Land Soldiers.</P>
<P>This Fleet arriv'd on <IT>Whitsun-Eve</IT> in <IT>Sweden</IT>, and landed their Marines, the which <IT>Gustavus</IT> order'd to reinforce his Army before <IT>Stockholm. Fleming</IT> that commanded the Squadron, cruiz'd before the Harbour to prevent any Succour from entring the Town. Where he receiv'd Information that the <IT>Danish</IT> Fleet was within Ken; he order'd <IT>his</IT> to shrowd themselves behind the Cape that forms the Harbour. Two of the smallest Frigates were sent by the <IT>Danes</IT> to ex&rehy;plore the Coasts (tho' they had heard nothing of the <IT>Lubeck</IT> Squadron) as soon as the first Frigate had doubled the Cape, she was taken; <IT>Fleming</IT> mann'd her with <IT>Swedes</IT>, and sail'd back to meet the <IT>other</IT> where the <IT>Danish</IT> Admiral was, who seeing the first return, came in a Boat to meet her to know the reason of her coming back, but soon shar'd the same Fate. When this was done, <IT>Fleming</IT> attack'd the whole Squadron, and conquer'd all but one desperate Captain, who fought like a Fury, and chose rather to blow up his Ship than fall into the hands of the <IT>Swedes</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Norbi</IT> was so exasperated at this Misfortune, that he invaded <IT>Sweden</IT> with all the <IT>Danish</IT> naval Force. He found their Fleet in the Harbour of <IT>Stockholm</IT>, and came to a Battle that lasted several Hours, but seeing the appearance of an approaching Storm, steer&rehy;ed out of the Harbour, to a little Island to prevent the Effects of it, this Bay was safe, but near the Shore. In the first part of the Night there came so hard a Frost, that his Ships were frozen. The ever vigilant <IT>Gustavus</IT>, upon that Knowledge, advanc'd secretly in the Night, and attack'd the Enemy with <PB
N="21">his Land Forces, set fire to, and destroy'd several Ves&rehy;sels of the Enemy, and might have ruin'd 'em all, but for the Inactiveness of the <IT>Lubeckers</IT>. The next Day the Sun having melted the Ice, <IT>Norbi</IT> retir'd with the remainder of his Squadron to the Port of <IT>Calmar</IT>.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Tyrant <IT>Christiern</IT> was depos'd by his grieving Subjects in favour of the Duke of <IT>Hol&rehy;stein</IT>, which when <IT>Norbi</IT> understood, he gave up all Thoughts of relieving <IT>Stockholm</IT>, and retired with his Fleet to <IT>Gothland</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> conven'd the Estates of the Kingdom, where they with universal Acclamations chose him King (tho' he for the present refus'd to be crown'd for many politick Reasons) calling him <IT>The Deliverer of his Country</IT>, congratulating their own Happiness in so puissant a Monarch.</P>
<P>After this he march'd with all his Forces, attended by the Deputies of the Kingdom, to besiege <IT>Stock&rehy;holm</IT>, now reduced to the utmost Necessity, but his Successes had so terrified them, that they surrendred at Discretion.</P>
<P>King <IT>Gustavus</IT> entred in Triumph, pompously dress'd for the Occasion. His Mien, his Youth, his Lenity, and noble Deportment, gain'd him the Love and Admiration of all that beheld him.</P>
<P>Archbishop <IT>Trolio</IT> heard the Advancement of <IT>Gu&rehy;stavus</IT> with a rancorous Heart, and tamper'd so art&rehy;fully with the new King of <IT>Denmark</IT>, that he per&rehy;suaded him to send an Ambassador to claim his Right to the <IT>Swedish</IT> Crown, but the Indignation of the <IT>Swedes</IT> return'd him to his Master, with a Proclama&rehy;tion that declar'd <IT>Trolio</IT> a <IT>Traitor</IT> and a <IT>Rebel</IT>, and out of the unbounded Love to their illustrious Mo&rehy;narch invested him with an absolute Power of Regal Sway.</P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> in Return sent an Envoy to <IT>Frederick</IT>, to demand <IT>Steno's</IT> Widow, and several Ladies that had been confin'd in <IT>Denmark</IT> ever since the Massacre at <PB
N="22"><IT>Stockholm</IT>: And the <IT>Danish</IT> King understanding the Strength, Unanimity, and the Power of <IT>Sweden</IT>, thought fit to wave his Pretensions to that Crown, and enter into an <IT>offensive</IT> and <IT>defensive</IT> Treaty against <IT>Christiern</IT> who was soliciting Powers in <IT>Germany</IT> to regain both <IT>Kingdoms</IT>: He therefore sent <IT>Gustavus, Steno's</IT> Widow and the Ladies, with an honourable <IT>Convoy</IT> to <IT>Sweden</IT>.</P>
<P>When they arrived, the <IT>King</IT> and all his <IT>Court</IT>, ho&rehy;nourably received them, and conducted them to the City.</P>
<P><IT>Norbi</IT> the <IT>Danish</IT> Admiral frequently infested the <IT>Swedish</IT> Coast, giving the Names of Usurpers and Traitors to <IT>Gustavus</IT> and <IT>Frederick</IT> King of <IT>Denmark</IT>. He took many Prizes, but chiefly the Traders of <IT>Lu&rehy;beck</IT>, their frequent Losses so terrify'd that Trading Republick, that they sent an <IT>Envoy</IT> to <IT>Gustavus</IT> for Assistance to root out that <IT>Pyrate</IT>. The <IT>Prince</IT> was hardly prevail'd upon to undertake this Expedition, however by the Perswasions of his Subjects, he over&rehy;run that Island and set down before the <IT>Capital</IT> with ten thousand Men. But <IT>Norbi</IT> hoisted the <IT>Danish</IT> Standard, went over to <IT>Frederick</IT>, and dealt so poli&rehy;tickly with him and the <IT>Lubeckers</IT>, that <IT>Frederick</IT> sent a Fleet which enter'd the Port of <IT>Wisby</IT> the Capital of <IT>Gothland</IT>, without any Opposition from the Fleet of <IT>Sweden</IT>. The two Kings met and held a Confe&rehy;rence relating to each others Right to <IT>Gothland</IT>, but it was not determin'd; yet they parted in seeming good Friends. When <IT>Gustavus</IT> return'd to <IT>Sweden</IT>, his Sub&rehy;jects pressed him to hasten his Coronation, but his Reasons concerning the Change of Religion were not ripe enough for that Ceremony. The Doctrine of <IT>Luther</IT> took footing in <IT>Sweden</IT>, abetted secretly by the <IT>King</IT>, but it was a nice and dangerous Affair, and tho' his Hand was open ready for the Grasp of the overgrown Revenues of the <IT>Bishops</IT> to support the Crown, yet he durst not at that Juncture seize, but he effected it at last, seiz'd the Church <IT>Plate</IT> and <PB
N="23">Utensils, their <IT>Bells</IT> and <IT>Crosses</IT>. This alarm'd the Clergy, who are too often tenacious of their Privi&rehy;leges, who took a Resolution to stir up the Peasants at <IT>their</IT> yearly Meeting at <IT>Upsal</IT>, to demand their Re&rehy;storation, and his abolishing the new <IT>Edict</IT> of the Tythes. But <IT>Gustavus</IT> having Spies every where, came upon them at the Head of a Body of Horse, to their no little Surprize at his sudden Appearance: There was such an Air of Grandeur and Authority, with the Force of Eloquence in all his Actions, that aw'd the boldest of these Malecontents, and soon brought them on their Knees to sue for <CORR

<P>The Great <IT>Gustavus</IT>, being thus happily rid of his Enemies, and his Dominions in a profound Peace, apply'd himself wholly to the <IT>Improvement</IT> of <IT>Trade</IT>.</P>
<P>He built <IT>Citadels</IT> and <IT>Royal Palaces</IT> in many Parts of the <IT>Kingdom</IT>, with a Magnificence unknown before to the <IT>Swedes</IT>. He never resided long in one Place, but progress'd from <IT>Province</IT> to <IT>Province</IT>, attended by most of his Court, which accustomed his Subjects to his <IT>Sight</IT> and <IT>Authority</IT>. This great <IT>King, Hero</IT> and <IT>Statesman</IT> in one, gave Audience to all Sorts of Persons; he decided all Causes and Controversies, with a Judgment peculiar to himself, and as War was carried on without the Assistance of Generals, so he rul'd absolute in a profound Peace many Years.

<PB N="27"><P>Our renowned <IT>Hero</IT> had four Sons, <IT>Eric</IT> the eldest, whom he had Hopes of matching to <IT>Elizabeth Queen</IT> of <IT>England</IT> whose Alliance he much wish'd for. He therefore, in order to bring this Affair about, sent an <IT>Ambassador</IT> to that <IT>Virgin Queen</IT>, to propose a Confede&rehy;racy between the two Nations. The <IT>Queen</IT> of <IT>England</IT> was courted by most of the <IT>Princes</IT> of <IT>Europe</IT>, but she had the Art to manage her Lovers as she pleased, amu&rehy;sing them with Hope, in their several Turns, accord&rehy;ing to the State of her Affairs.
</P><P>This <IT>Ambassador</IT> was <IT>Tutor</IT> to <IT>Prince Eric</IT>; when he arriv'd at the <IT>Court</IT> of <IT>Queen Elizabeth</IT>, he was receiv'd with all the Marks of Kindness and Respect. The Proposals he made in the Name of his Master, in Re&rehy;lation to <IT>Commerce</IT> and <IT>Confederacy</IT>, were favourably heard, and when he mention'd a stricter Alliance be&rehy;tween that <IT>Queen</IT> and <IT>Prince Eric</IT>, he had no reason to complain on that Subject. He therefore return'd to <IT>Sweden</IT>, where he inform'd <IT>Gustavus</IT>, that there was no&rehy;thing wanting but the Presence of <IT>Prince Eric</IT>, to com&rehy;pleat the Alliance between the two Crowns.</P>
<P><IT>Prince Eric</IT> was endowed with many Qualities that were sufficient to recommend him to those whose Judgment lies in the Sense of <IT>seeing</IT> only, for Nature had been liberal in bestowing Favours on him. The Symmetry of his Body was exact; In short, to say no more, he was the very Copy of his Father, with the same Air of Grandeur, Majestick Presence and Au&rehy;thority that drew Respect from all that saw him: But the Lustre of these <IT>outward</IT> Qualifications were darkened by some <IT>inward</IT> Passions of the Mind that ill became the Heart of a <IT>Prince</IT></P>
<P><IT>Gustavus</IT> <CORR SIC="knowiug">knowing</CORR> all his Failings, wou'd not be per&rehy;suaded to let his Son visit the <IT>young Queen of England</IT>, nay, he had some Thoughts of settling the Crown of <IT>Sweden</IT> on his Second Son, a Prince endow'd with all the Virtues of his great Father. But that wise Mo&rehy;narch considering such a Preference might kindle a Civil War both in his <IT>Family</IT> and <IT>Kingdom</IT>, resolv'd to <PB
N="28">regulate the Succession, according to the Order of Birthright, and in the mean time to satisfie <IT>Prince Eric</IT> (whom his <IT>Tutor</IT> had inspir'd with a violent Pas&rehy;sion for the <IT>Queen</IT> of <IT>England</IT>), he consented that Prince <IT>John</IT>, his <IT>second Son</IT>, shou'd go to the Court of <IT>Queen Elizabeth</IT>, under the Pretence of Travel, and try to fix her in Favour of his elder Brother.</P>
<P>The Queen receiv'd him with the most obliging Expressions of Kindness, yet so dexterously avoided his Proposals of Marriage with <IT>Prince Eric</IT> his Bro&rehy;ther, that <IT>Prince John</IT> was out of all Hope.</P>
<P><IT>Prince Eric</IT> thought his Presence wou'd do the Bu&rehy;siness effectually, sollicited the <IT>Senate</IT> to gain Leave from his Father to go in Person to negotiate the Affair of Marriage: <IT>Gustavus</IT> knowing the violence of his Temper, was persuaded at last to let him go, with a Retinue suitable to his Quality and Occasion; for that wise Prince foresaw if he did not give his Son Leave, that he wou'd either go without his Consent, or raise some Commotion in the State.</P>
<P>However before he wou'd let him depart for <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, he sign'd his Last Will, and divided his King&rehy;doms among the Princes his Sons; to the eldest Prince <IT>Eric</IT> he left his <IT>Crown</IT>; to Prince <IT>John</IT> his se&rehy;cond Son, the <IT>Dukedom</IT> of <IT>Finland</IT>; to Prince <IT>Mag&rehy;nus</IT> his third, <IT>East Gothland</IT>; to Prince <IT>Charles</IT> the youngest, <IT>Sudermania</IT>; under the Titles of <IT>Principa&rehy;lities</IT>, and all to swear Fealty, and pay Homage to the Crown of <IT>Sweden</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Prince Eric</IT> was highly offended at this Distribution of his Father's, and had Thoughts of taking up Arms to have this Will disannull'd, but was restrain'd from it, when he consider'd <IT>Gustavus</IT> was <IT>King</IT> of his <IT>Children</IT> as well as his <IT>Subjects</IT>. He therefore stifled his Resentments for the present, but made a Resolu&rehy;tion to do it himself, whene'er the Supreme Power shou'd fall into his Hands: But now his Imaginati&rehy;ons were all employ'd upon his Love, and his Time taken in preparing for his Voyage; he came to the <PB
N="29">Port of <NOTE N="(24)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Elsingbourgh</IT>, a good Port in <IT>Denmark</IT> over against <IT>Zeeland</IT>.</NOTE> <IT>Elsingbourgh</IT>, where he was stop'd with the News of his illustrious Father's Death, from whence he return'd to take Possession of the Crown of <IT>Sweden</IT>.</P>
<P>This <IT>Heroick Prince</IT>, in the 70th Year of his Age was seized with an inward Fever, that quickly gave him notice of approaching Death. He dismiss'd his Court, and even his Physicians that seem'd to flatter him with Life, and gave up his Breath in the arms of his most faithful Servants, <IT>September</IT> the 29th, 1560. His Body was interr'd at <IT>Upsal</IT>, and embalm'd with the Tears of all his Subjects; and his Memory is still dear to them.</P>
<P>This <IT>Illustrious Hero</IT> enter'd the Realms of <IT>Death</IT> adorn'd with such <IT>shining Honours</IT> that will eclipse those <IT>ancient Heroes Alexander</IT> and <IT>C&aelig;sar</IT>.</P>
<P>I don't know any <IT>Author</IT> (in my Opinion) has made a better use of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Poetica Licentia</FOREIGN>, than the Author of the <IT>Play of Gustavus Vasa</IT>; and I think it must give <IT>all Lovers</IT> of the <IT>Drama</IT> an infinite Satisfaction to find his <IT>first</IT> Essay arrive at <IT>Perfection</IT>. And I do not in the least doubt, but his Success will be answerable to the Greatness of his Merit.
