<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER REND="ro">Printer.</SPEAKER> <P>I don't like their Characters, or Epithets; for I believe there's a real value in our Coine; and I know little of their Spiritual Notions, neither will I puzzle my Head about what they tell me I can't rightly Un&rehy;derstand.</P></SP>

<SP><SPEAKER REND="it">Auth.</SPEAKER><P> I had several Reasons that induc'd me to put this Title to my Book; and not to keep you longer upon the Fret, I will tell you some of them. <IT>First</IT>, The natural inquisitive Humour that reigns in all Mankind after Novelty; for no sooner will the Title be Read, or Cry'd, but the Reader, or Hearer, will query what it's about, conclude it some Maggot or other, and to be satisfi'd, will Buy it; so you'll gain by his Curiosity. Then I've known many dull Books that have sold well, by the help of an Ingenious, or Whimsical Ti&rehy;tle. <IT>Puffe me, Puffe mo, Puffe cannot stay, Colle molle Puff</IT>; the Odness and Maggot of that Cry, has sold the Fellow many a Tart; for many Persons who only out of Curiosity have peep'd into his Bas&rehy;ket, have found something or other that pleas'd them. Besides the Title is a <IT>pro po</IT>, because the Subjects I write about, tho' they make a great bustle in the World, yet their Conclusions, or Produce, are very Frivolous, Insignificant, and answer not the End design'd.</P></SP>

<DIV><P>&Hic;OW Fruitless and Empty the Requests of the <IT>Poor</IT> have return'd at Court, whether they have been for <IT>Justice</IT> or <IT>Mercy</IT>, is apparent from a Thousand Instances: And one I'll relate to you, without Peevish design of Reflecting upon any particular Court, for the <IT>Pauper's</IT> Petition is alike neglected (by what I've Seen, Hear'd, or Read) in every Court. A Gentleman (fitly Qualifi'd) who by permission had Purchased an Imploy for Life, under a King, and to his Successors, was, upon a Successor's coming to the Crown (tho' he had taken Oaths of Allegiance, and done what was requisite, according to Law, for Qualification) to feed the Avarice, or gratify the wicked Bounty of a certain Person, to whose care the Managery was intrusted, was turn'd out, with only the Madmans humourous Reason, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sic Jubeo, sic Volo</FOREIGN>. By which unjust (at least unkind) usage, he had very little left to maintain himself, Wife, and four Children.
</P><LG REND="it" TYPE="couplets"><L>At once his <RO>Quondam</RO> Friends sounded Retreat,
</L><L>Wou'd scarce afford good Words, and much less Meat:
</L><L>To see his Face, they'd never after Care,
</L><L>As if his very Looks Infectious were:
</L><L>Like Careful Bees, to their own Hives they flew:
</L><L>As he from Fortune, they from him withdrew.</L>
</LG><PB N="4"><P>I cannot forbear in this place putting the Epithet <IT>Wicked</IT>, to that Generous Virtue, <IT>Bounty</IT>; since here 'twas a powerful Robbery com&rehy;mitted upon one Mans Right, to seem Bounteous in a Bequest to a&rehy;nother. The depriv'd Man hurt, complain'd with all the respect a Supplicant should use, but his Prayer was answer'd with a Negative. Afterwards he serv'd that King without Pay in His Army abroad; and upon the death of the Possessor of his Imploy, he again pray'd to be Restor'd; upon which prayer he had an Order for the next Va&rehy;cancy; which when happen'd, a certain Gentleman, who but a short time before had presented the Depriv'd Man to the King, in the Army, and had given it un&rehy;der his Hand, That he had been turn'd out without cause, and that he serv'd as a Volunteer; gave it again under his Hand, That the poor Petitioners alledging to have serv'd in the Army, was a mistake; and his last Act (the former, in good manners, I'll believe being forgot) was credited; so Order and Pe&rehy;tition were both dismiss'd, to the Ruine of the Man, and his Family.
</P></DIV><DIV><HEAD REND="it">OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>By this true Relation is evident, the little success that is to be expected from the <IT>poor unhappy</IT> Man's Petitioning against a Man in <IT>Power</IT>; for when he pleases, he <IT>Blackens</IT> and <IT>Misrepresents</IT> an Under&rehy;ling; and what a Favourite says, is easily believ'd.</P>

</LG><P>In such a Case, a Prince is the easiest Man in the World to be Im&rehy;pos'd on, considering the vast multitude of Affairs that Center in His ordering and Manage, the particular Cognizance of all which, 'tis impossible for Him to take; for upon a kind of Necessity He is oblig'd to have His knowledg of several Affairs from the report that those about Him are pleas'd to make; and what Man will tell a Story to his own disadvantage?

<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">Expectations of Benefit from a Covetous Man in his Life-time.</HEAD>
<DIV><P><FOREIGN LANG="LAT" REND="it">&Qic;Uis Pauper? Avarus</FOREIGN>: An admirable and proper Answer to the Question; because the Covetous Man wanteth that which he hath, as well as that which he hath not, as proves true by the following relation. A Friend of mine (if a Co&rehy;vetous Man can be so) of Gentile Extraction, and sutable Education, having a competent Estate of four hundred Pounds <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">per Annum</FOREIGN>, and a thousand Pounds in Money left him, which Revenue as far excee&rehy;ded his desire of Living, as it came short of his desire of Acquiring; for he no sooner had the Possession, but he retrench'd the usual Ex&rehy;pences of the Family; he sav'd Charge, by putting away the Mouths that caus'd it; and the only Servant that he kept, liv'd almost like a Bear in <IT>Greenland</IT>, on the Nourishment he had got in the Summer of the Fathers Life time. In short, no <IT>Anchorite</IT> liv'd more sparing than he, unless it were upon anothers cost, and then 'twas a covetous hu&rehy;mour made him Eat and Drink like a Glutton and a Drunkard. In all his Actions he was Base; He would Steal his own Goods, to make his Servant pay for them: By such sorbid ways his Wealth was accu&rehy;mulated; he sold the Mansion-house, because the Purchase-Money would yield a greater profit than the Rent amounted to; and retir'd from a great House (not from Plenty and Abundance) to a less, that he could not Rent out: By such Niggardly Methods, in process of time, he had heap'd up a very great Treasure.</P>
<P>There was a Young hopeful Gentleman, his Nephew, who expe<PB N="6">cted to reap the fruits of his Covetousness, that often came to visit him; and was always Complaisant, sooth'd, and commended every Humour, which I take to be the right way of Pleasing; for certain (at least during the time of prevailing Fancy, or Action) every Man is pleas'd with his own Sentiments, or Doings; so consequently loves to have them approv'd, and applauded.</P>
<P>He gratifi'd the Misers Appetite at his own Expence, his Pantrey and his Cellar were always ready to gratify his least motion of desire, his Coach and Horses attended his occasions; he baulk'd his own Humour, neglected his pleasant and facetious Companions, and con&rehy;fin'd himself to Oblige his Sordid Temper. Tho' it must be confess'd Self-interest mov'd him, yet it pleas'd the Wretch, when he advised him to secure his Treasure, that no <IT>Rachel</IT>, or other, might Steal his God. He Christned his Son of the <IT>Jew's</IT> Name, he did, what not? to Oblige him. He defended him from Robbers at the peril of his own Life: Nay more, He justify'd his base Principles, contrary to his Conscience: But all the Returns that were paid to these Services, were Mountain-Promises, whilst in his Cups; but Molehills, or no Performances, when Sober.</P>
<P>Afterwards this Obliging Gentleman fell by misfortune into Straits and Necessities, so that his Family wanted convenient Sub&rehy;sistance; yet the other pitiless, and unconcern'd, return'd no good Nature, no Charity, no grateful Act, for all his generous Obligations; not so much as even common Humanity would out of Mercy oblige a very <IT>Jew</IT> to show to a Stranger in Misery. After the Miser had Bought what he had left, for half the value, he forbid him his House, and whenever he met him, he pass'd by him as a Stranger. At last, Intestate, the miserable Rascal Dies; for the very Thought of dispo&rehy;sing of his Riches, would have been as Mortal as a Cannon Shot: So <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Volens Nolens</FOREIGN>, what he left, fell to this Gentleman. But I had almost forgot to tell you, That his Jealous Temper (which must ac&rehy;company the Covetous, let their Avarice be fix'd on what it will) made him Bury a great part of his Money and Writings, so that a great deal was lost for want of the knowledge of the Concealments.</P>
<PB N="7"></DIV><DIV><HEAD REND="it">OBSERVATION.
</HEAD><P>A Covetous Desire is properly applicable to self, for even when I seem to desire the Advantage of another, there is something of self in the matter; and it must be allow'd that he I wish well, is my Friend; tho' anothers being my Enemy, only makes him so; so by my desire, I gratifie my own Inclination in my Friends Advantage, or please my Anger, in my Enemies Disadvantage; a Covetous Mans Thoughts center in his own profit, and what good goes besides him, he counts by Providence wrong apply'd; then 'tis Idle to expect, that he that Covets all, should frustrate his vast design, by giving me a part; as Covetousness is a Selfish humour, 'tis impossible it should be diffusive.</P>
<LG REND="it"><L>The Misers Wish, is of a vast Extent,

<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">The Marriage of an Old Man to a Young Woman.</HEAD>
<DIV><P>&Tic;He mutual Disapointments that commonly thwart, and hinder the Happiness expected by the Marriage of an Old Man to a Young Woman, the following Story sets forth: An Anci&rehy;ent Gentleman, whose head Age had Powder'd like a Beau's, who in his Sprightly Youth could at Sight answer the Expectations of the most Lascivious Female, as Doctors Commons and Parish-Books could Witness, he had liv'd a Libertine Life, and had never thoughts of <PB
N="8">Marriage, till he was Three Score and Ten, when he happen'd into the Company of a Beautiful Young Woman, whose Charms, and Behaviour blew away the Ashes that covered the Fire that remain'd in the Brands end, so that it made a Faint Blaze, which (of late un&rehy;accustom'd) warmth made the (willing to be Deceiv'd) Senior fancy that there was yet a great Stock of Vigour in his Veins, that would answer the ends of Marriage; thus when Lechery had left his Tail, and agitated only by Desire, fancy'd mighty Peformances in his Lustful Brain, he Courts this Lady for his Bride, who had not the Charms to renue an old <IT>&AElig;son's</IT> Age, sensible that his expiring Flame could not long last, he was Impatient of delay; so by continual Court&rehy;ship he try'd to watch his Mistress, like a <IT>Hawk</IT>, into Compliance; but 'twas perswasive Money that made her Consent to endure a <IT>Len&rehy;ten Pennance</IT>, in Expectation of an happy <IT>Easter</IT> after his Death. In short, for filthy Lucre Married him, and submitted herself to his Feeble Threescore and Ten Years Attempts, after his fluttering all the Wedding Day, they were put to Bed, (I think that word suitable to his Age) and after Sack-Posset Eat, and Stocken thrown, the Company withdrew, and left them to themselves. When he fail'd in Performance, she was frustrated in her Expectation, so that their Marriage signified Little or Nothing.
</P></DIV><DIV><HEAD REND="it">OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The Answer I make, to those that will say, Every Body knew this Story before, is, That tho' I pretend to Write Novel's, I don't No&rehy;velties, but to dress up something that for one Meal may be Pleasing, and of grateful Gust; and perhaps some Observation may be made from this Story worthy Self-Application: But tho' the Reader do not, I will, to continue the Method I first Design'd.</P>
<P>To Attempt any thing, which nothing but (almost) a Miracle can make Successful, is Folly and Madness; and little less, can move a Man of Threescore Years and Ten to do &horfill; to any purpose. An Old Man Marrying a Young Woman, is like laying down a good Joynt of Meat, to an almost Consumed Fire, which will blaze a while, but by the sudden decay, for want of Fuel, will make it but luke Warm: <PB
N="9">He is counted a Blockhead that pretends to set up a Trade, when he is past Labour, without he takes an able Journeyman; and I be&rehy;lieve in this Case, no Man will willingly admit of a Journeyman to manage his Commodity, and without one (by effects may be judg'd) the Marriage will signifie little towards Procreation. Dis&rehy;appointments must happen to the Man from Natural Consequence, notwithstanding the mighty belief of his Abilities. I have known from Powerful Fancy, when a Child has been tyred with Walking, yet Imagining he Rode when he had a Switch between his Legs, would Imitate the Trot and Gallop, for a small while, without complain&rehy;ing; but presently the weakness and Imbecility of his Feet, made him sensible his Natural Strength (tho' agitated by Desire) could not carry him to his desired home: So the Old, whose Vigorous heat is Spent, may imagine if he get a Cock Horse, how furiously he'll Ride; but like the tyred Child, his Natural decay will appear.</P>
<P>The Man being deceived, by Consequence the Woman must; and what sad Effects do such Disappointments cause, are Evident from the future carriage of both Man and Woman: He grows Jealous, un&rehy;willing another should Feed, tho' he himself can't make use of the Dainties; then the Poor abused Woman is watch'd, perhaps confin'd, and her whole Life made uneasie.</P>
<P>Like a poor Man (cajoll'd by mighty Promises) transported to the <IT>West-Indies</IT>; when he comes there, finding himself a Slave, to the Beck and Rod of an Imperious Patron, being fast bound by Con&rehy;tract, has no hopes of Liberty, but from the Expiration of time; such is the Condition of a Young Woman, who flatter'd with the belief of Fond Doting Dalliance, and Plenty, is betray'd into the Slavery of Marriage, with an Old Fellow, she has no hopes of Deliverance from, but by the Expiration of her Disagreeable Husbands Life; her Youthful heat meeting with the Icy coldness of his Age, causes thun&rehy;der in the House: Continual Jars forbid all hopes of Peace.</P>
<LG REND="it"><L>When Waves Swol'n high by force of mighty Wind,
</L><L>They fiercely meet, and are in Battle joyn'd;
</L><L>The frothy Salt, with motion's set on Fire;
</L><L>But Wash'd with Native Water, soon expire:

</L><L>Such Disappointments happen to them both,

<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it">Endeavours to Regulate Mens Manners by Preaching or Writing.</HEAD>
<DIV><P>&Tic;HE present Age is not so very Vertuous, but that we may meet with examples in almost every Company and Con&rehy;versation, that demonstrates the little Efficacy the well de&rehy;sign'd Writings and Publick Teaching of Good Men have had, to&rehy;wards Reformation of Manners, and the Practice of Vertue. But not being willing to expose particularly the Insensibility that appears either in my own Life, by not Amending, and Correcting my re&rehy;prov'd Actions, or in the general Practice of any Fellow-Country&rehy;men; I have pitch'd upon the History of <IT>Socrates</IT>, so far as it agrees with my Design; that is, to show how little the good Documents he Taught, signified to the Reform or Benefit of the <IT>Athenians</IT>, and the <IT>Odium</IT> they caused from those he endeavour'd to Amend.
<PB N="11"></P><P><IT>Socrates</IT>, who was Born in a small <CORR
SIC="Villiage">Village</CORR> called <IT>Halopex</IT>, under the <IT>Athenian</IT> Jurisdiction; is commonly called the <IT>Athenian</IT>, to distin&rehy;guish him from several others, of that Name, one of which Wrote the History of <IT>Argos</IT>, another was a <IT>Bathynian</IT>, &amp;c. This <IT>Socrates</IT> the <IT>Athenian</IT>, was taught Philosophy under <IT>Anaxagoras</IT>, he was a Man of great Temperance, of a strong Constitution, one who enquir'd into the Nature of Sublime things, Studied Humanity, Practised and to poor and Rich Publickly Preached Vertue and Good Manners; to be silent, and not to reprove Wicked Men, he counted a Crime against the Gods; to Discourse of Vertue, he esteem'd as a great Happiness; and imploying himself almost constantly in instructing of the Citizens, he neglected mightily his private Affairs, so that he was Poor, and told the <IT>Athenians</IT>, that he ought to be Maintained out of the <IT>Prytaneum</IT>, or <IT>Publick Store-House</IT>: That he ought to be Rewarded more then a Victor, for the Conqueror could but make them appear to be Happy, when by his Instructions in Vertue (if Practi&rehy;sed) they would really be so, not only from present Serenity of Mind, but in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Futuro</FOREIGN>; for he believed an Immortality of the Soul, and the very day he Died, he imploy'd in Discoursing of, and by Convincive Arguments to his Friends prov'd the Souls Indivisibility, and Con&rehy;sequently Immortality; he Taught as he Believ'd, that nothing of Evil could happen to a Good Man, his Concerns being taken Care of by the Gods; but notwithstanding his Eloquent, perswasive Spee&rehy;ches upon so Noble a Subject, as Vertue, which for its own Sake, ought to attract Mens Inclinations, and Affections; the <IT>Athenians</IT> were so far from Reforming from their Accustom'd Immoralities, that <IT>Miletus, Anytus</IT>, and others, accused him, as Guilty of a Capital Crime, for Instructing the People in the ways of Vertue, and for Reproving them, when they Acted contrary to Morality and good Manners: They were so Exasperated aganst him for his Good En&rehy;deavours to introduce Honesty and Piety, Inconsistent with their Practice, that without a Confronting Witness, they Condemn'd him to Death; which Sentence was put in Execution by a Draught of Poyson. By which Barbarous usage, 'tis Apparent that all his Teach&rehy;ing signified little towards the Reformation of the Lives of his Fellow Citizens.
<PB N="12"></P></DIV><DIV><HEAD REND="it">OBSERVATION.
</HEAD><P>Tho Licentiousness is more agreeable, and facile to the deprav'd Nature of Mankind; yet almost every Age hath produc'd a Preach&rehy;ing Experienc'd <IT>Solomon</IT>, a <IT>Socrates</IT>, a <IT>Plato</IT>, or some such Good Men, who have Endeavour'd by Writing and Teaching, back'd with the Inducing Reasons of a present Serenity of Mind, that must upon Necessity Accompany Vertuous Actions, or the Glorious Prospect of an Unconceivable Reward hereafter; to perswade Men by Argu&rehy;ments, Conducing to self Interest, (which in all other Cases is prevai&rehy;lent) to Practice Piety, Honesty and Civility, yet what poor Crops have the Stony Soil produc'd, every Age against it self is Witness. The <IT>Libertinism</IT> of an <IT>Heathen</IT>, I don't so much wonder at, because he has no Thoughts of Futurity to Check his Mad Career; but that Men who are dayly Taught, and Instructed in Piety, and Morality, and who upon a Self-query, will own that they really Believe to do Good, is for their Advantage, should Act directly contrary to their Belief, is an Extravagant Madness, not to be parallell'd: Is there no Remedy for so Great, and Contagious an Evil to be found? Yes, an <IT>Heathen</IT> teaches me one, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Trahimur Exemplis Plus Quam Pr&aelig;ceptis</FOREIGN>; for if those in Power and Greatness Practised Vertue, the Underlings would Imitate; if 'twere Customary, every one would be in the Fashion: But whilst Vice and Immorality are Countenanc'd by the Great, Or&rehy;ders for keeping the <IT>Sabbath</IT>, and against Prophanness, are of little Efficacy; for when the great Fish break the Net, the little ones will go out at the Rent.

<DIV><P>&Oic;NE, who out of Good Manners, I must stile a Gentleman, because he justly Claims that Title from his Ancestors; and it must be allow'd him now, even in his Adversity, since his Accounted Crimes of Omission, in not actually complying to the Laws in force, proceed from the Dictates of his Conscience, and not from an Obstinate Spirit of Contradiction; for tho' this Gentle&rehy;mans Opinion will not permit him to comply in the Active part, yet out of Submission to the Laws of his Countrey, without re&rehy;fractoriness, he's Obedient in the Passive. This Gentleman (as many others) is at this time term'd a <IT>Jacobite</IT>, as being the title Custo&rehy;marily used, in Opposition to <IT>Williamite</IT>; concluding, that he that is not for me, is against me.
</P><P>Upon the Revolution in the Year 1688, (which by Unfathom'd Providence was brought about, so contrary to Rational Appearance, that after Ages will hesitate at the Belief of the Heroick Attempts of the present King, and the Unaccountable Manage of the last) this Man was turn'd out of several Considerable Imploys, (or rather he turn'd himself out, for it cannot be expected, that any will be <PB
N="14">Master (unless by Power to those that will not serve them) strip'd of his Incomes, he for a while handsomly subsisted; but feeding con&rehy;stantly upon last Years Crop, without Sowing for another Harvest, his Granary was Empted without hopes of Replenishing, without a Miracle, Reduc'd; he herded with those of his own Opinion, that by the Benevolence of Fortune were able to relieve him, and did Generously for a time; but continual Dependance made him sensi&rehy;ble of the Bitterness of the Curse: The Undervaluing Slights, the tyring Attendance, often Refusals, beggarly Loans, Reprimands, Ad&rehy;vice too late given, all which, with appearing Patience, by force he was oblig'd (if he would Eat) to undergo, made him almost distract&rehy;ed in his Thoughts. The impending Misery of want by its near ap&rehy;proach, appearing Dreadful and Afrightning, put him upon the Studious Thoughts, how to subsist for the future. He considered the many reasons drawn from self Interest, and other Powerful Motives, for Conforming to the present Government; the general Consent, and Practice of many, whose Learning and Integrity he could not call in question (unless he should Contradict his own Experience) made him bring his Manage into Examination, and his Rational Arguments made him often Waver, and query the Prudence of his Opinion; so far, that he had some thoughts of Conforming to what the Representatives of the Nation had agreed; but having so long stood out, he could have no hopes of being received with that fa&rehy;vour, so as to be trusted in any considerable Imploy; either Civil, Military, or Ecclesiastical; he was too Poor, and of too little Inte&rehy;rest, to expect an Honourable Title; too Illiterate to be made a <IT>Dean</IT>, too well known to be trusted with the Managing of a Secret in National Affairs; so he struck to his old Principals tho' he reap'd no Ad&rehy;vantage by them, for <IT>Poverty</IT> like <IT>Ivie</IT> twines to the <IT>Jacobite</IT>, and spoils his Growth; his Opinion Contradicting in general, to the Sen&rehy;timents of the greatest part of the Nation, was so far from being any ways Advantagious to him, that it expos'd him to want; and debar'd him from the hopes of repairing his Ruined Fortunes.</P>

</HEAD><P>&Tic;HIS Story is equally applicable to <IT>Jacobite, Williamite, Wigg, Tory</IT>, or what other Name of Distinction is given to a&rehy;ny Man, who Rows not with the common Stream that the Ri&rehy;ver of his Country runs; he tugs against the Tide, and makes very little Progress. To oppose the General Sentiments of a Country, is drawing up-hill by choice, and gives just cause for People to call a Man's Judgment in Question, since there is a nearer, and down-hill beaten Path at Hand; 'tis something like going in the <IT>Strand</IT>, towards the Horse-Guard, on a <IT>Sunday</IT> in the Evening, when one has the trouble of meeting the Current of the City Gentry, going from the <IT>Park</IT>; he that complies not to the Practice of a Nation, appears like one in a Sad-colour&rehy;ed Coat, bearing Arms amongst the <CORR

</P><P>Relating to a Man's Compliance, or Non-Compliance, ought to be considered; whether what required be consonant to Ju&rehy;ice, and Self-Preservation, argued Pro and Con, in refference to Spiritual, and Temporal Affairs, the last not contradicting the formers positive Commands. And sure I am, or must appear to be, by rational Men, much Wiser, or more Blockish, than the rest of the Nation, in a General Council consenting, if I oppose, or refuse Conformity to its Agreement. Parallel Examples ought to be search'd for, and the method of Proceedings, that have been commonly taken by others, approv'd by future Allowance to have been Just, and fitting to be done, ought to Guide, and mightily Sway me to concord to such approv'd Precedents; for if a Man disagrees out of a particular Opinion, or Interest, he, as far as in him lyes, calls the discretion of a great many in Question, and battles a number with his opiniated Reason, from such Proceeding, one can expect no Benefit, or Reputation. No Advantage, because none will trust another (in any thing of Weight) that is of a contrary Perswasion; because 'tis reaso<PB

<DIV><P>&Aic; Grave Citizen, an Alderman's Fellow, by Losses and Cros&rehy;ses, and GOD knows what, was reduc'd to the necessity of leaving his House, and moving himself and Effects into the Sanctuary for Bankrupts, <IT>White-Fryars</IT>; where, for a while he confin'd himself to his Chamber, and when he went out, the Company seasoned to the Place, who were no proud Men, but would quickly be acquainted without Ceremony, made him a<PB

What? Refuse to take Ten Shillings in the Pound? If I might advise you, they should not have above half a Crown; I intend to give mine but Eighteen Pence; sure you are not such a Fool to part with all, and suffer your self and Family to want: Such Company, such Examples, such Documents have wash'd a&rehy;way the honest first Intents of many a Man, but it could not flote his; for he still design'd, to his Power, to satisfy every Body; but unwilling to be Caged in a closer Prison, he there Liv'd; and spending upon the main Stock constantly, it wast&rehy;ed so fast, that at his next Proposal to his Creditors, he could offer but Five Shillings, which was also rejected: And some time after not being watchful of his Ways, the Catchpoles siez'd him at the Suit of an old protesting Friend of his, a Neigh&rehy;bour, for whom he <CORR

<P>&Tic;HOUGH Disappointments are in some Degree or other, most commonly the Companions that attend and thwart the Hopes and Expectations of all Mankind; yet have I not observ'd more Disappointments generally to accompany any At&rehy;tempt, than I have the Endeavours, and Designs, to get into Repu&rehy;table Places and Employments, as by the Sequel will appear.
</P><P>An <IT>English</IT> Gentleman, who by Hospitality amongst his County Neighbours, had Spent the greatest part of his Estate; having ve&rehy;ry little, besides the <IT>Mansion Seat</IT> of his Family left, seeing himself Slighted by those very Men who had largely tasted of his Bounty, seriously began to Consider, how he should still Support himself in some Credible Reputation; and after he had run over several de&rehy;signing Thoughts, and Built <IT>Castles</IT> in the <IT>Air</IT>, he at last fix'd upon the common Hopes of getting a Place, or Employ at <IT>London</IT>. To effect which, he presently Sold the remaining part of his Estate; and to <IT>London</IT> he came, to put in Practice the <IT>Scheme</IT> he had Drawn, for raising once again his Fortune. His first Application was, to besure, to one of the worthy Burgesses that Serv'd for a Neighbouring Cor&rehy;poration, who by the Charms of Bribery, and by Virtue of his strong Drink, had carried the Election <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Nemine Contradicente</FOREIGN>; him he ac&rehy;quainted with his Design, and desir'd his kind Assistance, who pre&rehy;sently Promised Fair for Country sake, th&ocirc; he was an <IT>Irishman</IT>; up&rehy;on his Promise, every Morning he danc'd Attendance, at the Lev&egrave;e of my <IT>Dear Joy</IT>; and when he walk'd, he kept Cringing on his Lar&rehy;board Quarter, not presuming to go <IT>Cheek by Jowl</IT> with one of the Representatives of the Nation; who had the same Business during the whole Sessions of Parliament, that he had during the Term-time, two Motions a Day, to <IT>Westminster</IT> and back again; but finding his Waiting, and the other's Promises, would Signify the same thing, and the Senator being gone to <IT>Tunbridge</IT>, where the Proverb was on his side, he bethought himself what farther Methods were to be ta<PB
N="23">ken; and luckily finding upon a Coffee-house Table, a Paper Inti&rehy;tuled, <IT>A Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and Trade, by</IT> John Houghton, <IT>F. R. S.</IT> Wherein he found, that he knew of se&rehy;veral that wanted Men so or so Qualified and Recommended, and several that were so and so Qualified and Recommended, that want&rehy;ed the Imployments which others wanted to have Officiated. At first view he thought this Paper as a Pillow of Light to guide him in the Dark: But upon examining the Inquiries af&rehy;ter Places and Imploys, and those that wanted Agents, found they answer'd one another's Occasions, and that there was not one Agent enquired after, but there was the same Place sought for; so he dispair'd of Success from that, seeing every one's Occa&rehy;sion might be supplied.</P>
<P>Though his Sleep, or rather Slumbers, was unquiet and short, occasioned be the concern that hagg'd his Thoughts about his future earthly well Being, yet his lying Awake was more tor&rehy;menting to him, as much as Impending want had then a more lively Impression, than his drowsy Fancy could Represent; so trying, as if it were to avoid himself, he arose, slighting Beau&rehy;ish Formality, soon dress'd himself, and went to <IT>Man's Coffee&rehy;house;</IT> where, though 'twas early in the Morning, he found Talk&rehy;ative <IT>Will</IT>, a tall elderly Man, with his own Hair, diverting the Company, sometimes in <IT>English</IT>, sometimes in <IT>French</IT>; in both Languages he told Stories as improbable to be true as all D. <IT>O's</IT> Narrative. He took upon him the States-man, and told the Company he knew of Funds that would have rais'd Money e&rehy;nough to defray the Charge of the War, without being any pressure to the Subject: He blam'd all that he was pleas'd to think Mismanagement in the Concerns of the Nation; and then gravely told them, how all might have been prevented, which every Block-head can do, after the Act is past; and, for the future how he would have things managed; but Mercy upon us if Affairs were to be ordered by his Managery, (looking upon his own Conduct) it may reasonably be believed, they would have been Ten times worse directed. After he had Rail'd at several particular Persons, whose names he did not tell. (but describ'd them plainer than I do him) He grumbled at the Bounty bestow'd upon Favorites; but I suppose his Cozen <IT>Harry's</IT> <PB
N="24">Humour then possess'd him, who always Rails when he is Poor; but whilst a Bounty is in his Pocket, (which never wears it out) he is as much for Praising, as when Penniless in Railing and Re&rehy;flecting. If Variety be pleasing, sure Mr. <IT>William's</IT> Discourse was diverting; for he run over Stories (as much as the time would allow) of Men and Women, of all Qualities, all sorts of Countries, Governments, Languages, Horses, Dogs, Cocks, Wine, Snuff, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> as positively as if he had been an Eye or Ear-wit&rehy;ness, had Travell'd them all over, been a Privy-Councellor in every one of them; a Professor of Languages, own'd, or layed Wagers, Drank, Tasted, or Snuff'd of every sort: But at last took opportunity (though no occasion offered) to tell how nigh he was Related to, and how he was belov'd and respected by a <IT>Dutch English</IT> Nobleman; which at last startled my Inquirer from the Confusion the medley of his Discourse had put him into, and brought into his Thought, that this Gentleman's Inte&rehy;rest might do him a Kindness.</P>
<P>His approaching Necessity having made him confident beyond his natural Temper, he presently enquired the Gentleman's Name and Lodging, and that Day waited upon him, and in short de&rehy;sired his Favour towards helping him to an Imploy fit for a Gen&rehy;tleman, and at the same time promised to be grateful; Mr. <IT>William</IT>, who never wants complimental Civility, told him, that he would assist him in what lay in his Power, and mentioned to him several Places that he might endeavour to get; but know&rehy;ing none then Vacant, he desired he would meet him on the Mor&rehy;row, when he would bring a Man (meaning his Cozen <IT>Harry</IT>) whom the Cobweb Laws cannot confine, though in close Con&rehy;finement) who knew of Forty to be dispos'd of. The next Day, according to appointment, they all met, and <IT>Harry</IT> cajoll'd my Inquirer, and fitted his Humour to a T---; indeed he must be of a very stingy Temper whom he cann't please, for he is re&rehy;ally a very sensible Gentleman. My Inquirer's Desires were made known to him; and <IT>Harry</IT> (who never parts with a Man, but he leaves him a plausible prospect of effecting his Designs) laid down such Assurances upon Promises made in his Favour, that my Gentleman began to believe at such a Day he might enter <PB
N="25">into Pay or Sallery; but before he parted, <IT>Harry</IT> had nicely examin&rehy;ed, though at a distance, how his Stock was, either to Bribe or Pur&rehy;chase, and in a Day or Two was to give my Enquirer a positive An&rehy;swer; but I had almost forgot to tell you, that just at parting <IT>Har&rehy;ry</IT> bore up to him, and told him, that though he would serve a Gen&rehy;tleman gratis with his Labour, yet there would be Expences; to de&rehy;fray which, he expected he should bring him Ten Guineas the next Morning. My Enquirer, buoy'd up with hopes, came the next Morning with ready Rhino in his Pocket, had immediately Admit&rehy;tance into a Room spread with old Carpets, that the Man at the Three Roses had refus'd to Stitch Cards on. Presently honest <IT>Har&rehy;ry</IT>, who like the Hungry <IT>Jew</IT>, watch'd the falling Manna, came in, and accosted him with, Sir, I've done your Business, for I was with my Lord last Night, and to serve you, spent my own Interest, so ef&rehy;fectually, that I had his Promise on your Behalf: Upon these words the Manna dropt into his Hand, which <IT>Harry</IT> never kept till the fol&rehy;lowing Day, for fear it should turn Sower: My Enquirer's moving Hand having reach'd Ten, at which number <IT>Harry's</IT> Allarm stood, it immediately rung a Peal in Division about Places, for half an Hour together, That he that wrote the present State of <IT>England</IT> in the Year, 1694, was a Block-head compared to him; for he has not mentioned a quarter of the Places and Imploys, that <IT>Harry</IT> nam'd to my Enquirer, and gave him the choice of any of them: He that put an Advertisement for the Sale of Horses, cann't in a Months time name so many Horses to be sold, as he pretended to know Imploys: My Enquirer, amongst the many Texts this Parson Quoted, pitch'd upon Two or Three which serv'd to his liking; and when Mr. <IT>Har&rehy;ry</IT> had done talking, he told him, such or such would suit his Educa&rehy;tion, and agreed with his Humour. Oh, says <IT>Harry</IT>, those are not as yet Vacant, but they will be perhaps before the Parliament rises; for they are resolved to suffer very few Members of the House to be in Imploys, wherein any Branch of the Revenue is to be managed; and since 'tis certain some will part with their Places rather than to be turn'd out of the House, your study must be, how to get into one of those they Abdicate; to effect which, you must try to engratiate your self with a S------ of S--, with Three of the L--- of the T----- at least: And the thoughtful Gentleman, who, by much Labour of his Brain, hammers out things in a great Perfection, to be <PB

I must beg Pardon, when I say, 'tis hard that so understanding a Gentleman; one that knows how to take all Advantages, should not be in the House, no Man being fitter to caution against Deceits, than the ---- He has been serviceable to the Nation by the project of pack&rehy;ing of Hay; by the manage of which, Horses Eat less than u&rehy;sual, and their Bellies were taken up, without Belly-cloaths, the smell did their Business; yet <IT>Tony</IT> had but 31. a Load, for what cost him 25s.</P>
<P>His Principles may be guess'd by his Practice; and he has de&rehy;clared his Sentiments, how People that would thrive, should ma&rehy;nage themselves; and designs (if he may be believed) to instill the same Principles into his Children; for he told an honest Gentleman, that if he had a Son, he would advise him to flat&rehy;ter and dissemble with all Mankind; never to speak Truth but when it was for his Advantage: With this worthy Gent.

N="27">under the M--- of the H---; for every one of them that were in his reach, he has either sold, or been a Broker in the matter: You need make to Interest to him by Intercession of Friends; for he has no respect to Persons, Principles, or Qualities; but like a late decea&rehy;sed Knight, whose Wit (by mistake so called) lay in bold Examinati&rehy;ons of Scripture passages; buffonly rediculing what was beyond his shallow Capacity to understand) has regard only to the Money, let it come from <IT>Williamite, Jacobite</IT>, or <IT>Devil</IT>: Besides him, there's a&rehy;nother you should be acquainted with, that is a blinking Fellow, a meer pretender to the Law, who could scarce Read (allowing Bre&rehy;viations) at the Exchequer Bar: He, by his Pretensions, one would think had the disposal of 40 considerable Places; indeed he has most of the Gentry at his beck, though 'tis a shame to see how poor spi&rehy;rited some of them are, to cringe and creep to him, whom most ho&rehy;nest Men avoid; though there's a broad mixture in this Man of Knave and Fool, yet he so manages by Tricks and Lyes a certain Person in whose Power 'tis to make you one extraordinary; that a Trial ought to be made of his Interest: And sure, by some of these, with my Assistance, (which you shall never want, a Man of your Birth, Education, and Ingenuity) cann't miss of some Imploy or other. Now Sir, I've told you what's to be done, use your en&rehy;deavour; and when you have fix'd upon your particular, come a&rehy;gain to me, and I (as Mr. <IT>Houghton</IT> says) can help. My Enquirer, with his Head full of this Council, takes leave, resolving to medi&rehy;tate on it, and put it in Practice; but going down Stairs, he saw a written Paper which <IT>Harry's</IT> Servant had drop'd; and being curi&rehy;ous, took it up and put it in his Pocket to Read at Leisure; the first opportunity he had he opened the Paper, and found as follows: <IT>Answers, Excuses, and Observations, to be got by heart, and used, as occa&rehy;sion offers, by my Servant</IT> Robin.</P>
<P REND="it">If a Man knocks hard early in a Morning, with a Cane in his Hand, believe him a Creditor, and the first time answer him, that I am not well, and you dare not Disturb me; to Countenance which, besure two or three days in a Month, tye a Rag upon the Knocker of the Door. The Second time, I was sent for about earnest Business, to any busie Nobleman you first think of. Afterwards say for me, as you would have others say for you to <PB
N="28">whom you Owe Money; but besure you be not catch'd in a Lie, for People are too apt to believe that Courtiers Servants Lie; tho' they speak Truth, if their Desires be'nt Comply'd with. If it be one that wears a Sword, 'tis Ten to One but 'tis either some body I am in Combination withall to Cheat another, or that he himself is to be Cheated, him presently admit, for from such, Corn comes to the Mill. If it be one whose Company I have shun'd, send him to some <RO>Tavern</RO> or <RO>Coffee-house</RO> out of the Verge of the Court, where to besure I never go but on a Sunday.
</P><P>Some part of the Paper had been torn off, but one may be certain, he had learn'd the whole Lesson by the variety of Shams and Excu&rehy;ses he had constantly ready. Bless me, how was my Inquirer Sur&rehy;priz'd at the Reading it! and began to conceive that he was fallen into the Hands of a Tongue-Padding Cheating Courtier; but find&rehy;ing his Counsel in some measure ought to be followed, he was re&rehy;solved to make Applications as he was directed. In a short time by Friends or Money, he was little or much Recommended to almost all Fortune's Darlings, that had the Disposal of any Employs; one or other of them he was almost continually waiting on with the Re&rehy;commendation of my Lord such an one, Sir such an one; or honest Mr. such an one; and every one to whom he was Recommended, like true Courtiers, spoke him fair: One promised the next thing that fell; another promised to take Care of him; a Third, out of Kindness, would have him Qualify himself, that upon any Oppor&rehy;tunity he might jump in: A Fourth took Money in part; and a Fifth invited him to Dinner, which Gentleman it must be said of him, did him more Kindness than all the rest; for after he had wait&rehy;ed half a Year, he found their promises to be only Air; for when the first had power by a Vacancy, to besure he said, He was pre-in&rehy;gaged. The Second's care was to avoid him. The Third Gentle&rehy;man would not give him Opportunity to Jump, continually Selling Reversions. The Fourth did his Business but in part, for he could never get all his Money again. Thus Shuffled off from one to ano&rehy;ther, by fair Words and Promises, he spent a great deal of time, and all his Money to no purpose; meeting with so many Disappoint&rehy;ments, and really wanting Necessaries, and reflecting on the Usage he had met withal, and dreading the Poverty he saw approaching, he had fallen into Dispair, but that he had still the Happiness to carry in his Mind, the Thoughts of Futurity, from which he resolv'd as <PB
N="29">much as possible to be Content; and to strengthen him in his Acqui&rehy;essing, and Resignation to a Supreme Will, he often went to Church; but one day going into St. <IT>Martin's</IT>, th&ocirc; early, the Surly Clark re&rehy;fus'd him admittance into a Pew, which so mightily concern'd him, that he went to his Lodging, and whilst the Thought continued, he Wrote the following Verses.</P>
